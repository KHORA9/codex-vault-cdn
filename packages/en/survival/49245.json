J. ROCHE,\r\n        Minister of the Interior,\r\n            Ottawa.\r\n\r\n    SIR,—I have the honour to transmit herewith the manuscript of a\r\n    compilation of all available information on the Unexploited West\r\n    by Major Ernest J. Chambers, Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod.\r\n    This work, which was undertaken by Major Chambers under\r\n    instructions from this Department, is drawn from all known\r\n    sources. The information contained herein covers the whole of\r\n    the unexploited portions of Canada, west of Hudson bay, and it\r\n    is intended to fill a growing demand for complete information\r\n    regarding this territory.\r\n\r\n                             I have the honour to be, Sir,\r\n                                        Your obedient servant,\r\n                                                   F. C. C. LYNCH,\r\n                                  _Superintendent of Railway Lands_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stream of immigration steadily flowing westward in ever-increasing\r\nvolume is rapidly exhausting the reserves of vacant land in that part of\r\nthe Canadian west which used to be known, to the detriment of the\r\nterritory farther to the north, as “The Fertile Belt.”\r\n\r\nAlready settlement has overflowed the northern frontier of the “belt of\r\nsupposed limited fertility” and many thousands of acres of agricultural\r\nland have been surveyed by the Dominion Government immediately north of\r\nthe North Saskatchewan and in the Peace river valley, and the surveys\r\nare being rapidly extended to keep up with the pressure of advancing\r\nsettlement. While the trend of immigration is turning northward, the\r\neyes of the capitalist are attracted in the same direction. Information\r\nconcerning the resources of the country once ignored is now sought for.\r\nFacts about the climate, the soil, the timber, the rivers, the lakes,\r\nthe minerals, the fish, the game obtained at the risk of life and limb\r\nby fur trader, explorer, missionary, geologist and sportsman, even those\r\nfacts regarded not so long ago as merely interesting, have now a\r\npractical value.\r\n\r\nThe once prevalent notion that the whole of the immense territory north\r\nof the North Saskatchewan was a sterile, frost-bound waste destined for\r\nall time to remain a wilderness, is now largely a thing of the past, and\r\nthe opportunities which the latent resources of the silent places of the\r\nunexploited northwest afford to the enterprising and adventurous at the\r\npresent moment challenge the attention of the world.\r\n\r\nWith interest powerfully attracted to the more easterly sections of the\r\ncountry under review by the recent extensions northward of the limits of\r\nthe prosperous provinces of Ontario and Manitoba, and with easy means of\r\ncommunication with the larger divisions farther west assured, thanks to\r\nthe progress of the construction of railways northward to Port Nelson on\r\nHudson bay and to McMurray in the Athabaska country, it certainly looks\r\nas though the long neglected Northland were coming to its own at last.\r\n\r\nBy connecting with the three thousand miles of almost uninterrupted\r\nsteamboat communication on Athabaska, Peace, Slave and Mackenzie rivers,\r\nand Athabaska and Great Slave lakes, the railway being pushed into the\r\nAthabaska country will place the whole of Mackenzie basin within easy\r\nreach of the prospector, the explorer, the sportsman and the tourist.\r\nThe line being constructed to Hudson bay, as soon as steamboat\r\nconnection is established therewith, will lay the very heart of that\r\nalluring El Dorado which we call the Barren Lands, with its herds of\r\nmusk-oxen and caribou and its mineral wealth, open to the prospector and\r\nthe sportsman, for, via Chesterfield inlet, Baker lake and the Thelon,\r\nthere is a splendid, uninterrupted waterway from Hudson bay for a\r\ndistance of five hundred and fifty miles into the interior.\r\n\r\nThe exceptional attractions which the Northland holds out to the\r\nsportsman are certain to contribute largely towards the discovery and\r\ndevelopment of the natural resources of the country. A couple of years\r\nago Mr. W. T. Robson, General Advertising Agent of the Canadian Pacific\r\nRailway, submitted to a convention of railway men a thoughtful paper on\r\nthe value of the tourist sportsman as a means of publicity for\r\nundeveloped country, in which he pointed out that the cultured business\r\nmen who find their greatest pleasure, relaxation and physical benefit\r\nfrom trips into the wilds, are quick to discern the commercial value of\r\nwater powers, timber and minerals, and he related a number of instances\r\nwhere hunting trips had resulted either in the discovery of unexpected\r\nnatural resources or in large investments in the country visited.\r\n\r\nThe object of the present publication is to present, with some degree of\r\nsystematic arrangement, all of the authentic information available at\r\nthe moment as to the natural resources of the less-known and unexploited\r\nportions of northern Canada lying west of Hudson bay and James bay and\r\neast of the main range of Rocky mountains.\r\n\r\nThis general definition of area brings within the scope of this volume\r\nthe whole of that portion of the old provisional district of Keewatin\r\nrecently divided by act of parliament between the provinces of Ontario\r\nand Manitoba, those portions of the provinces of Saskatchewan and\r\nAlberta north of the unsettled and unsurveyed territory, the basin of\r\nMackenzie river, and that immense country north of the new provincial\r\nlines extending from Mackenzie basin to Hudson bay, which has\r\napparently, undeservedly, come to be known as “Barren Lands” or “Barren\r\nGrounds.”\r\n\r\nIn these immense regions there are wide areas of which we in this year\r\nof grace 1912 know as little as was known of Bow river valley in 1812,\r\nand that was nothing. On the other hand considerable is known in a\r\ngeneral way about certain portions of every one of the great districts\r\nwhich form this vast territory, or, to be quite exact, considerable has\r\nbeen written about them. The subject matter has been so widely\r\ndistributed that no one could be expected to be familiar with it all.\r\n\r\nPractically the first authoritative data as to the natural resources of\r\nCanada’s unexploited northland was contained in the published evidence\r\nof a British parliamentary committee which sat in 1749 to enquire into\r\nthe resources of the country administered by the Hudson’s Bay Company.\r\nWith this as a nucleus, a considerable amount of information on the\r\nsubject has gradually accumulated. The journals of officials of the big\r\nfur-trading companies have contributed to this fund of information and\r\nso have the writings of missionaries, the reports of British, Canadian\r\nand United States official government explorers, the narratives of\r\nsportsmen and adventurous travellers, and the patrol records of that\r\ninimitable and ubiquitous body the Royal Northwest Mounted Police. A\r\nvery wide range of information regarding the various sections of these\r\nterritories, too, has been placed on record as a result of several\r\nCanadian parliamentary investigations.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the large amount of literature relating to the great\r\nnorthland which has accumulated, can be obtained from the fact that in\r\nthe preparation of the present book nearly three hundred publications\r\nhave been consulted, necessitating an amount of reading which was not\r\nanticipated when the task was undertaken. Much of this reading was\r\nabsolutely unproductive, a considerable portion of the books written by\r\nmen who have lived in or travelled through the country being merely\r\nnarratives of travel and adventure, containing no direct information of\r\nany value as to natural resources.\r\n\r\nFor various obvious reasons many books written by scientific and\r\nobservant men who have visited the still new west are of little value in\r\nthrowing light upon the questions of the natural resources of the\r\ncountry. One of these reasons is referred to by Sir Alexander Mackenzie,\r\nwho states in the introduction to his narrative:—“I could not stop to\r\ndig into the earth, over whose surface I was compelled to pass with\r\nrapid steps; nor could I turn aside to collect the plants which nature\r\nmight have scattered in the way, when my thoughts were anxiously\r\nemployed in making provision for the day that was passing over me.” The\r\ndistances to be travelled in the far Northland are generally so great\r\nthat the slender stores of supplies carried by the explorer and\r\ntraveller do not permit of time being devoted to thorough investigation\r\nby the way. Again, much of the travelling in the unsettled north has\r\nbeen done in winter, when the surface of the ground was covered with\r\nsnow, making an examination of the soil and rocks impossible.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the literature relating to the new Canadian northwest is\r\nso voluminous that it contains, scattered throughout it, an aggregate\r\namount of practical information regarding the resources of even the more\r\nremote sections of the country that, as assembled within the two covers\r\nof a single volume, will probably astonish most readers.\r\n\r\nThe present volume, according to the instructions the undersigned\r\nreceived from the Department of the Interior, is purely and simply a\r\ncompilation. Care has been taken to avoid the temptation to try and\r\nproduce a work of original literary merit, and in the following pages it\r\nwill be found that the compiler has introduced only as much original\r\nwriting as is necessary to introduce intelligibly the various\r\nquotations, or to establish the connections between them, his aim being\r\nto present all the data available in the original text, or as near to it\r\nas the exigencies of compilation and space would permit.\r\n\r\nWith the object of properly introducing some of the chief authorities\r\nquoted and of placing the reader, from the beginning, au fait with the\r\ncircumstances under which the principal information regarding the\r\nresources of the country was obtained, the presentation of the data has\r\nbeen prefaced by a brief historical chapter.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the book a list of the written authorities from which\r\nquotations are made will be found.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that, to avoid confusion, the vast region under\r\nreview has been divided into five distinct territorial units, and that\r\nthe matter relating to each unit is in turn divided into four sections,\r\nrelating respectively to the resources in the way of arable land,\r\ntimber, minerals, and fish and game. The compiler found that this system\r\nof classification was satisfactory in his two previous volumes of a\r\nsomewhat similar type, “Canada’s Fertile Northland,” and “The Great\r\nMackenzie Basin,” and a continuation of the system will facilitate\r\nreference between the present volume and those which were its\r\nforerunners and its inspiration.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I might be permitted here a word of personal explanation. I have\r\nhad only a slight acquaintance with any part of this great waiting\r\nNorthland, having campaigned a little over its southern margin between\r\nNorth Saskatchewan and Beaver rivers, in Fort Pitt district, during the\r\noperations against Big Bear’s Indians in 1885; but what I saw of the\r\ncountry then, with its park-like groves of fine trees, its valleys\r\ncovered with luxuriant grasses, its sylvan lakes teeming with fish, and\r\nevery prospect a gem of nature’s own perfect landscape gardening, made\r\nsuch an impression on my mind that I have ever since felt a personal\r\ninterest not only in that particular section but in the vast regions\r\nbeyond which have not the charm of the soft and lovely scenery of Loon\r\nlake and Beaver river. Having this feeling towards the country I have\r\nfollowed as a hobby the literature relating to it, and it has been\r\nnaturally a pleasure to contribute my mite in helping it along towards\r\nits ultimate destiny.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the present volume was not mine but that of the late Mr.\r\nRobert E. Young, D.L.S., Superintendent of Railway Lands and Chief\r\nGeographer, the most enthusiastic believer in the Northland who ever\r\nlived, probably, and whose untimely death was a grievous loss to the\r\ncountry. If this book possesses any merits it is due altogether to his\r\noriginal suggestion, to his wide knowledge and to his enthusiastic and\r\nkindly co-operation.\r\n\r\n                                                   ERNEST J.

Thanks largely to the\r\ndiplomatic offices of the British government, the rights of the Hudson’s\r\nBay Company were eventually bought out by Canada, and this vast\r\nterritory, estimated at upwards of two million three hundred thousand\r\nsquare miles, was transferred to the Dominion of Canada in the year\r\n1867.\r\n\r\nThe cash consideration obtained by the company from the Dominion for the\r\nrelinquishment of its rights and titles was the sum of three hundred\r\nthousand pounds sterling; but there was also a provision for the\r\nretention by the Company of blocks of land adjoining each of its\r\nstations; and the right was allowed the company for fifty years, from\r\n1870, to “claim in any township or district within the fertile belt in\r\nwhich land is set out for settlement, grants of land not exceeding\r\none-twentieth part of the land so set out.”\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of the agreement the “Fertile Belt” was described\r\ntherein as being bounded as follows:—“On the south by the United States\r\nboundary; on the west by Rocky mountains; on the north by the northern\r\nbranch of the Saskatchewan; on the east by Lake Winnipeg, Lake of the\r\nWoods, and the waters connecting them.”\r\n\r\n                        THE TERM “FERTILE BELT.”\r\n\r\nThere is some uncertainty as to the origin of the term “Fertile Belt”,\r\nthus arbitrarily defined in the historical agreement with the Hudson’s\r\nBay Company; but this much is certain:—the term came into general use\r\nafter the publication of the reports of the official exploratory\r\nexpeditions of Captain John Palliser of the British Army, of S. J.\r\nDawson, C.E., and Professor Henry Y. Hind of Trinity College, Toronto.\r\nCaptain Palliser was commissioned by the British government to explore\r\n“that portion of British North America which lies between the northern\r\nwatershed and the frontier of the United States, and between Red river\r\nand Rocky mountains and to endeavour to find a practicable route through\r\nthem.” The Dawson-Hind expeditions (there were two) were under the\r\nauspices of the government of United Canada (Upper and Lower Canada) and\r\nwere for the purpose of inquiring into the resources of Red river colony\r\nand the Assiniboine and Saskatchewan countries. The British expedition\r\nextended over parts of four years—1857, 1858, 1859 and 1860, while the\r\nCanadian ones covered two years—1857 and 1858.\r\n\r\nIn the preface to his report, published in 1860, Professor Hind\r\nwrote:—“The establishment of a new colony in the basin of Lake\r\nWinnipeg, and the discovery of a FERTILE BELT of country extending from\r\nthe Lake of the Woods to Rocky mountains, give to this part of British\r\nAmerica a more than passing interest.” In another place Professor Hind\r\nwrote:—“North of the great American desert there is a broad slip of\r\nFERTILE COUNTRY, rich in water, wood, and pasturage, drained by the\r\nNorth Saskatchewan, and a continuation of the fertile prairies of Red\r\nand Assiniboine rivers. It is a physical reality of the highest\r\nimportance to the interests of British North America that this\r\ncontinuous BELT can be settled and cultivated from a few miles west of\r\nLake of the Woods to the passes of Rocky mountains, and any line of\r\ncommunication, whether by waggon road or railroad, passing through it,\r\nwill eventually enjoy the great advantage of being fed by an\r\nagricultural population from one extremity to the other.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wheat field at Stanley, Churchill river.]\r\n\r\nThe terms “Fertile Belt,” “Fertile Strip” and “Fertile Land” appear many\r\ntimes in Captain Palliser’s report, published in 1863, the first of\r\nthese expressions being used no less than three times in one paragraph\r\nof the report.\r\n\r\nThe influence of a “catchy expression” in attracting the world’s\r\nattention is wonderful. Whatever the origin of the term “Fertile Belt”\r\nin this connection, its emphatic application by these independent\r\nofficial reports to the particular strip of territory between the United\r\nStates boundary line and Saskatchewan river had immediate and lasting\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nIt arrested public attention in England and in Canada. That which had\r\noften been asserted by independent travellers, and more often stoutly\r\ndenied by those whose sole interests were centred in the fur trade[1],\r\nhad been found by scientific explorers of unquestioned veracity to be an\r\nactual fact. As Captain Palliser put it in his report:—“The whole of\r\nthe region of country would be valuable not only for agriculturists but\r\nalso for mixed purposes. I have seen not only excellent wheat, but also\r\nIndian corn (which will not succeed in England or Ireland) ripening on\r\nMr. Pratt’s farm at the Qu’Appelle lakes in 1857.” Professor Hind, in\r\nhis report, quoted interviews with enthusiastic settlers, who, on their\r\nprairie farms in Assiniboine valley, had for years been successfully\r\nraising prime wheat at a yield of thirty to forty bushels to the acre,\r\n“corn, barley, oats, flax, hemp, hops, turnips, tobacco and anything you\r\nwish.” He showed that similar conditions of soil and climate extended\r\nfar to the westward, and, quite naturally, he wrote of this area as the\r\n“FERTILE BELT.”\r\n\r\n                         THE OLDER INFLUENCES.\r\n\r\nThe Right Honourable Edward Ellice, one of the oldest governors of\r\nHudson’s Bay Company, asked, when being examined before the British\r\nParliamentary Committee of 1857, what probability there was of a\r\nsettlement being made within the southern territories of the company,\r\nreplied:—“None, in the lifetime of the youngest man now alive.” (“The\r\nGreat Company”, p. 480).\r\n\r\nSir George Simpson, who was for forty years governor of the Hudson Bay\r\nterritories and had visited every portion of them, was examined before\r\nthe select committee of the British House of Commons appointed in 1857\r\nat the instance of Mr. Labouchere, on the eve of the expiration of the\r\nlicense for exclusive Indian trade issued to the Hudson’s Bay Company in\r\n1838, to investigate the state of the British possessions administered\r\nby the Company. Sir George, being asked his opinion as to the general\r\nfitness of Rupert’s Land for colonization, replied:—“I do not think\r\nthat any part of the Hudson Bay territories is well adapted for\r\nsettlement; the crops are very uncertain.”\r\n\r\nBy officially establishing the existence of this rich, arable area in\r\nthe southern part of the territories governed by the Hudson’s Bay\r\nCompany, and by associating it with such an apt designation, the\r\nPalliser and Hind expeditions brought strong popular support to those\r\nwho in Britain and Canada were at that particular period actively\r\nworking to secure the introduction of Canadian jurisdiction over the\r\nwhole of the western part of British North America, and materially\r\ncontributed to the success of the protracted negotiations which resulted\r\nin the ultimate surrender of its rights of government, etc., by the\r\nHudson’s Bay Company. If any other proof was required to establish in\r\nthe popular mind the attractiveness of the “Fertile Belt” as a desirable\r\nsection for settlement, it was furnished by the written agreement under\r\nwhich the country was handed over to the Dominion of Canada, the term\r\n“Fertile Belt” therein receiving the stamp of the highest official\r\nrecognition, and by the Hudson’s Bay Company, famous as a shrewdly\r\nmanaged corporation, stipulating that the grants of land to be made them\r\nwere to be located within the area so designated.\r\n\r\n                   SETTLEMENT OF “THE FERTILE BELT.”\r\n\r\nThe term “Fertile Area” proved a very loadstone to the settler and the\r\ncapitalist. Ever since the settlement of the troubles which accompanied\r\nthe transfer of the great northwest to the Dominion of Canada there has\r\nbeen a stream of immigration flowing into the country, and up to the\r\npast few years the Fertile Belt has been the settler’s Mecca and El\r\nDorado.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1874 the region west of the original province of\r\nManitoba was ‘opened up’ by the Northwest Mounted Police as far as\r\nMacleod in the south, and Edmonton in the north. In 1885 the completion\r\nof the Canadian Pacific Railway main line gave western Canada direct\r\ncommunication with the eastern provinces, and a fair chance to develop\r\nher natural resources, particularly in the Fertile Belt, through which\r\nthe line was constructed.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 the population of the whole region east of Rocky mountains over\r\nwhich the Great Company had so recently relinquished its rule as Lord\r\nProprietor amounted to but a few hundred; at the present time (census of\r\n1911) it amounts to no less than one million, three hundred and\r\nforty-eight thousand, one hundred and seventy two. And with the\r\nexception of the partially settled areas in Beaver, Athabaska and Peace\r\ndistricts, and a few small, isolated posts on Hudson bay and along\r\nMackenzie river, the whole of this population is located within the\r\n“Fertile Belt” as defined in the Hudson’s Bay Company’s agreement of\r\n1869. This is not to be wondered at considering the undoubted natural\r\nattractiveness of the zone, its rapidly developed advantages in the way\r\nof railway communication, and the benefit it derived from being\r\noriginally introduced to the world as a future paradise of agricultural\r\nenterprise under such an apt and alluring designation as “The Fertile\r\nBelt.”\r\n\r\nBut while the united energies of the capitalist, the railroad builder\r\nand the agriculturist have been devoted to the exploration of the\r\nFertile Belt, the much larger area of virgin country extending from the\r\nnorthern limits of the strip in question to Arctic sea and lying between\r\nHudson bay and Rocky mountains has been neglected.\r\n\r\nThis (not including the Yukon), the most northern section of the vast\r\nwestern region formerly ruled by the big fur-trading company, comprises\r\nno less than one and one-half million square miles of country, or\r\nconsiderably more than the combined territory (on March 1, 1912) of the\r\nprovinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward\r\nIsland and Manitoba. Its very vastness, coupled with its remoteness from\r\nthe great centres of population, has tended to keep it, as far as the\r\nworld at large is concerned, comparatively\r\n\r\n                           A TERRA INCOGNITA.\r\n\r\nThe word “comparatively” is used advisedly, for while it is true that\r\nthe greater part of the unexploited northland is unexplored and unknown,\r\nwe have in one way or another obtained considerable useful information\r\nabout it. Now and again word has come from some missionary station or\r\ntrading post somewhere up in the far north, hundreds of miles beyond the\r\nnorthern limits of the “Fertile Belt,” of root crops, barley, oats, and\r\neven wheat being raised during a long succession of years with\r\nphenomenal success. Explorers returned from the great north have related\r\nhow they were regaled upon potatoes and other vegetables grown a few\r\nmiles from Arctic Circle. A sample of wheat grown at Fort Vermilion in\r\nnorth latitude 58·4°, three hundred and fifty miles north of Edmonton,\r\nwas awarded First Prize at the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia, in\r\n1876, in competition with the whole world. Geological explorers have\r\nreported vast deposits of coal and other minerals underlying immense\r\nareas in the far north. Adventurous travellers, back from the least\r\npromising regions of Canada’s great northland have disclosed the\r\nexistence of timber areas and of game and fish preserves of fabulous\r\nrichness.\r\n\r\nAnd this great northern country long ago had its champions who\r\nchallenged the attention of the world by predicting for sections of it,\r\nat least, an agricultural and industrial future. Mr. Malcolm McLeod,\r\nformerly of the Hudson’s Bay Company, and, as a son of the North,\r\njealous of its reputation, stirred up the thought that in the glamour\r\nattached to the original exploitation of the “Fertile Belt” the natural\r\nresources of the vaster country to the north would be overlooked, and in\r\nthe preface of his book, published in 1872, on Sir George Simpson’s\r\ncanoe voyage from Hudson bay to the Pacific in 1828, wrote:—“The object\r\nof the present brochure, at this juncture, is to direct attention—by an\r\naccount of a canoe voyage through the region—to the fact that\r\n=beyond that belt of supposed limited fertility=, which is\r\nimplied in the term “Fertile Belt,” there is, in our north west, an\r\narea, continuous in every direction and easily accessible to its utmost\r\nlimits, containing over three hundred millions of acres of wheat and\r\npasture lands, with forests of finest timber, and the largest known coal\r\nand bitumen, and also probably the richest gold areas in the world—a\r\nland teeming with animal and vegetable life, extending to the very\r\nArctic Circle, and owing its wealth in that respect to exceptional\r\ncauses. I refer to that area—comprised entirely of Silurian and\r\nDevonian systems—watered by the great Athabaska, Peace and Mackenzie\r\nrivers, with their countless affluents.”\r\n\r\nThe very year of Confederation the attention of the reading public of\r\nthe world was forcibly drawn to the latent natural wealth of the\r\nnorthland. The writer of an article published in the Westminster Review\r\nof July, 1876, (“The Last Monopoly”) pointed out that “nature marching\r\nfrom east to west, showered her bounties on the land of the United\r\nStates until she reached the Mississippi, but there she turned aside to\r\nfavour British territory. To the north the good land of the western\r\nstates is prolonged beyond the forty-ninth parallel, where it enters\r\nBritish territory as the Fertile Zone. The fertile zone curves towards\r\nthe north as it proceeds westward, so that the western extremity of the\r\nbelt is several degrees of latitude higher than the eastern, the curves\r\napparently corresponding pretty closely with certain isothermal lines.\r\nThe forest zone extends to latitude 61° on Hudson bay. Coal crops out at\r\nintervals in seams of ten or twelve feet thick from the Mackenzie in the\r\nfar north to the Saskatchewan. Ironstone has been discovered in the\r\nAthabaska. Sulphur abounds on Peace and Smoky rivers. Salt is plentiful\r\nnear Great Slave lake; plumbago and mineral pitch on Lake Athabaska;\r\ncopper, native and in the form of malachite, on Coppermine river.”\r\n\r\n                    THE NORTHLAND’S FIRST CHAMPIONS.\r\n\r\nTo find the first champions of the great Northland as a prospective\r\ntheatre of enterprise and development, and to trace the history of the\r\nexploration of the region from the beginning, it is necessary to go back\r\nmany years, to a date, in fact, only two years more recent than the\r\nfounding of Quebec by Samuel de Champlain.\r\n\r\nHenry Hudson, the great English sea captain, was engaged in the search\r\nfor a northwest passage, when on August 3, 1610, he rounded the\r\nnorthwestern shoulder of Labrador and entered the bay which he thus\r\ndiscovered and which now bears his name. The exploration of this great\r\ninland sea was begun, not for the sake of gaining a knowledge of the\r\ncountry surrounding it, nor for the development of its resources, but in\r\nthe delusive hope of finding a passage through it to the western ocean.\r\nIn 1612, Captain (afterwards Sir) Thomas Button, commissioned to search\r\nfor Hudson and to look for a northern passage, entered the bay with two\r\nships, and, holding on his westward course, encountered land at about\r\n60° 40′ north latitude. Being a Welshman, he called the land “New\r\nWales,” a name which afterwards gave place to “New North Wales” for the\r\nnorthern part, and “New South Wales” for the southern; but all three\r\ndesignations, as applied to the Hudson bay coast, are now only of\r\nhistoric interest. Button wintered at Port Nelson, which he so named in\r\nmemory of a shipmaster who, with many of the sailors, died there. When\r\nthe ice broke up he went northwards past Cape Churchill and landed at a\r\nplace about 60° north which he called “Hubbart’s Hope.”\r\n\r\nThe southern coast of Hudson bay, east from Port Nelson (York Factory),\r\nwas visited and explored by Captains Luke Foxe of London and Thomas\r\nJames of Bristol in 1631, and again visited by James in 1632. These two\r\nnavigators met off the coast near the mouth of Winisk river on August\r\n29-30, 1631. Each had given a name to the country to the southwest. Foxe\r\ncalled it “New Yorkshire” and James “The South Principality of Wales,”\r\nprobably on account of the previous name “New Wales” given by Button in\r\n1612 to the land southwest of Port Nelson. These two navigators sailed\r\ntogether to the eastward, to the entrance to James bay, and there\r\nseparated, Foxe to go north and James to the southward, to winter. Foxe\r\ncalled the bay he had left “Wolstenholme’s Ultimum Vale.” James, after\r\nrounding the cape, determined its latitude (55° 5′) and called it\r\n“Henrietta Maria Cape,” after the Queen, and also after his own ship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oat field at Ile à La Crosse.]\r\n\r\nIn 1668 Captain Gillam entered Hudson bay with a pioneer fur-trading\r\nexpedition under the patronage of some influential Londoners, at the\r\nhead of whom was Prince Rupert, Duke of Cumberland, Count Palatine of\r\nthe Rhine and cousin of Charles II, King of England. Thus was\r\ninaugurated the regime of the Hudson’s Bay Company, but the Royal\r\ncharter to Prince Rupert and his associates, constituting them “The\r\nGovernor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson’s\r\nBay”, was not granted until 1670.[2]\r\n\r\n                      “THE HUDSON’S BAY COMPANY.”\r\n\r\nThe company was organized to prosecute the fur trade, and not for\r\ncolonizing purposes. The few explorations into and from the company’s\r\nfirst posts on the bay were made solely in the interests of the fur\r\ntrade. When in 1683 Governor Sargeant was urged to send men to penetrate\r\ninto the country, the object was distinctly stated to be “to draw down\r\nthe Indians by fair and gentle means to trade with us.” This was the\r\nburden of many letters of instruction sent out to Hudson bay in those\r\ndays, but the response was not very promising. The company’s servants\r\nwere not easily induced to imperil their lives, particularly as they\r\ncomplained of lack of encouragement. In 1688 Governor George Geyer, who\r\nhimself, in 1773, had volunteered to do some exploring, was instructed\r\nto send the boy Henry Kelsey to Churchill river for an exploring trip\r\n“because we are informed he is a very active lad, delighting much in the\r\nIndians’ company and being never better pleased than when he is\r\ntravelling amongst them.” Thus began the adventurous career of one who\r\nmay be regarded as the pioneer explorer of the region under review.[3]\r\nIn 1690 Kelsey “cheerfully undertook a journey up into the country of\r\nthe Assiniboine Poets, with the Captain of that Nation.” The following\r\nyear he accompanied the Indians on a journey he computed at four hundred\r\nor five hundred miles, penetrating as far as the buffalo and grizzly\r\nbear countries. A diary of this trip was published, but it contained no\r\nreferences to the natural resources of the country. There followed a\r\nperiod of some activity in the matter of exploration by sea, the\r\ndiscovery of a northwest passage being aimed at. Between 1719 and 1737\r\nthe Hudson’s Bay Company alone fitted out nine vessels to participate in\r\nthis discovery, but these voyages added nothing to the scanty knowledge\r\nthen available as to the resources of the territory ruled over by the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nSoon after the Hudson’s Bay Company obtained its monopolistic charter,\r\nantagonism to it arose in England, and this hostility steadily\r\ndeveloped, the legality of the charter being flatly challenged. One of\r\nthe bitterest opponents of the company was Mr. Arthur Dobbs, a gentleman\r\nof means and scientific attainment, intensely interested in the subject\r\nof the northwest passage, who became embittered because he considered\r\nthe Hudson’s Bay Company had not furthered the exploration projects as\r\nhe thought they should have done. In 1744 he published a volume on the\r\ncountries adjoining Hudson bay, in which he arraigned the company for\r\nkeeping the country back. He declared that the company would not allow\r\ntheir servants to make any improvements at the posts except it be to\r\nplant turnip gardens. He proceeded:—“There might be comfortable\r\nsettlements made in most places, and very tolerable, even in the worst\r\nand coldest parts of that continent, which are the northeast and\r\nnorthwest sides of the bay; but in the southern and western sides of the\r\nbay, there might be made as comfortable settlements as any in Sweden,\r\nLivonia or the south side of the Baltic, and farther into the country,\r\nsouthwest, the climate is as good as the southern part of Poland and\r\nnorth part of Germany and Holland.”\r\n\r\n                    AN EARLY PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY.\r\n\r\nIn 1748, ten years before the capitulation of Montreal to General\r\nAmherst, a motion was passed in the House of Commons “to enquire into\r\nthe state and condition of the countries adjoining Hudson bay and the\r\ntrade carried on there, and to consider how those countries may be\r\nsettled and improved, and the trade and fisheries there extended and\r\nincreased, and also to enquire into the rights the Company of\r\nAdventurers trading into Hudson’s bay pretend to have by charter to the\r\nproperty of lands and exclusive trade to those countries.” The result\r\nwas an investigation, which produced a considerable amount of evidence\r\nthrowing the first official light upon the natural resources of Canada’s\r\ngreat northland.\r\n\r\nUp to this time the territory about Hudson bay had been commonly\r\nsupposed “to be a mere waste and howling wilderness, wherein\r\nhalf-famished beasts of prey wage eternal war with a sparse population\r\nof half-starved savages; where the drought is more than Saharan, the\r\ncold more than Arctic, and that woe would betide the mad and unfortunate\r\nindividual who might be so far diverted from the path of prudence as to\r\nendeavour to settle in those parts.”[4]\r\n\r\nEvidence heard before the committee revealed the fact that intelligent\r\nmen who have lived in the country several years considered that it\r\npossessed decided attractions as a field of settlement, and held that\r\nnothing but the policy of the fur-trading company kept settlement\r\nback.[5]\r\n\r\nSome of the evidence as to the resources of the country and as to the\r\nconditions of the very slim white population is still edifying. The\r\nattack upon the legality of the company’s charter, however, came to\r\nnothing, and the revelations made as to the suitability of the country\r\nfor settlement had no practical result, which is scarcely to be wondered\r\nat considering the conditions prevailing in both Europe and\r\nAmerica—conditions which in the course of a few years were to result in\r\nmomentous changes in the map of this continent.\r\n\r\nNo additional data as to the resources and geography of the great\r\nnorthland were produced until the years 1770 and 1771 when\r\n\r\n                    HEARNE MADE HIS HISTORICAL TRIP\r\n\r\nof discovery. Many of the witnesses examined during the enquiry of\r\n1748-49 had spoken of the statements of Indians regarding the rich\r\ncopper mines existing on a great river many miles to the northwest of\r\nChurchill. The Indians who visited that post in 1768 so impressed the\r\ngovernor, Mr. Moses Norton, with their version of the richness of the\r\ncopper deposits along the river they called the Neetha-San-San-Dazey\r\n(the “far-off metal river”), that being in London the following season\r\nhe induced the Company to send out an exploratory expedition. The man\r\nselected for the command was Samuel Hearne,[6] a capable and experienced\r\nmariner, then serving as mate on the Company’s brig “Charlotte.”\r\nHitherto all of the exploratory expeditions from Hudson bay towards the\r\nnorthwest had been in search of the northwest passage, and by sea, but\r\nnow it was decided to undertake exploration by land.[7] Hearne really\r\nmade three trips, two of which were unsuccessful. The first failed\r\nbecause of the lack of provisions, and the second because Hearne was\r\nplundered by his Indian companions and broke his sextant. On these trips\r\nhe attempted to penetrate to the northwestward through the so-called\r\nBarren Grounds or Barren Lands, but on the third venture, leaving in\r\nDecember, 1770, he kept more to the westward and, being in the wooded\r\ncountry, was able to provide himself with provisions and to travel with\r\nmuch less discomfort. As he was accompanied by a number of Indian\r\nfamilies as bearers and hunters, his progress was necessarily slow and\r\nindirect, on account of the difficulty of crossing lakes and large\r\nrivers, and of providing food for so large a party. His general line of\r\ntravel was at first a little north of west to Clowey lake, which was\r\nreached May 3, 1771, and thence a little west of north to the eastward\r\nof Great Slave lake, probably passing Artillery lake (his Catt lake?)\r\nand Clinton-Colden and Aylmer lakes (his Thoy-noy-kyed lake?) to the\r\nstream since called Coppermine river, which was reached probably near\r\nSandstone rapid.[8]\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteen years or so following Hearne’s discovery of\r\nCoppermine river, considerable knowledge was acquired as to the\r\nresources of the more southern portions of the still unexploited north\r\ncountry by the activities of the Canadian fur traders, including the\r\nNorthwest Company, in North Saskatchewan, Clearwater, Athabaska and\r\nPeace river regions,[9] and the resultant extension southward of the\r\ntrading operations of the Hudson’s Bay Company.\r\n\r\n                    MACKENZIE’S TRIPS OF EXPLORATION\r\n\r\nincluding the discovery of the great river of the north which still\r\nbears his name, were notable events in the history of the north country;\r\nmomentous events, in fact, in view of the knowledge first obtained\r\nthrough them of the vast natural resources of the great Mackenzie basin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Winter travel—Dinner time.]\r\n\r\nMackenzie set out on his first voyage from Chipewyan, at the head of\r\nLake Athabaska (a Northwest Company’s post), June 3, 1789, and proceeded\r\nin canoes via Slave river, Great Slave lake, and Mackenzie river as far\r\nas Whale island in the estuary of that stream. On July 16, he started on\r\nthe return trip by the same route, and reached Chipewyan on September\r\n12. On his second trip, in 1792, Mackenzie proceeded from Chipewyan to\r\nthe summit of the Rockies via Lake Athabaska, Peace river, and its\r\naffluents, making his way to the Pacific through the passes of the\r\nmountains, and down the streams on the western slope as best he could.\r\n\r\nDavid Thomson, an energetic but little known traveller, made a track\r\nsurvey in 1799 of Lesser Slave river, and of the Athabaska from the\r\nmouth of the Pembina to Clearwater forks. In 1803 he filled in the gaps\r\nbetween the forks and Athabaska lake, and in 1810 ascended the river and\r\ncrossed the Rockies by Athabaska pass.\r\n\r\n                           SIR JOHN FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\nWith the first journey of Lieutenant (afterwards Captain Sir) John\r\nFranklin, R.N., in 1820, began a series of explorations which extended\r\nover a period of about thirty years, in connection with which the study\r\nof the natural history and geography of the far north country was\r\ncarried on more systematically than had hitherto been possible. Franklin\r\nwas fully equipped by the British Government for scientific work, and\r\nwas accompanied by Doctor John Richardson, Lieutenant George Back and\r\nLieutenant Robt. Hood—men of acknowledged skill and ability. The\r\nexpedition left York Factory on September 9, 1819, and, travelling by\r\nway of Oxford House and Norway House, arrived on October 22 at\r\nCumberland House where they went into winter quarters. In order to\r\narrange in advance for the further progress of the expedition, Franklin,\r\naccompanied by Back, left Cumberland House on January 18, 1820, and,\r\ntravelling by way of Carleton House, Ile à la Crosse and Methye portage,\r\narrived at Chipewyan on March 26. Finally the party again set out on\r\nAugust 2, 1820, from old Fort Providence, on the north side of Great\r\nSlave lake, to ascend Yellowknife river, and on August 20 he reached\r\nWinter lake, near which he established his winter quarters. Here wooden\r\nhouses, dignified with the name of Fort Enterprise, were erected. In\r\nJune the following year the party descended Coppermine river, covering a\r\ndistance of three hundred and thirty miles to the sea, and paddled along\r\nthe coast eastwards, exploring the coast as far eastward as longitude\r\n109° 25′ west and latitude 68° 19′ north, thus exploring Bathurst inlet\r\nand Coronation gulf. The story of the dreadful hardships endured by the\r\nparty on the return trip, one-half of the whole number, including\r\nLieutenant Hood, dying of starvation and exposure, forms one of the most\r\nghastly chapters in the history of Canadian exploration, and its\r\npublication did much to deepen the popular impression that the whole of\r\nthe great northland was a hopelessly inhospitable region. As a matter of\r\nfact the disasters which overtook this expedition were due to its\r\ncommissariat being inadequately outfitted. The Admiralty, who planned\r\nthe expedition, knew practically nothing about the conditions of travel\r\nin the regions that they proposed having explored, and depended for aid\r\nupon the Hudson’s Bay Company. That corporation did its best, but was\r\nunable to extend to Franklin any official aid after he left Great Slave\r\nlake or to supply him with proper provisions. The bitter fight between\r\nthe two big fur-trading companies had reached a climax; every officer of\r\nthe Hudson’s Bay Company was needed in the Company’s service, and\r\nsupplies at the frontier posts were at the lowest ebb. So the expedition\r\nplunged into the unexplored wilderness without enough food and\r\ninadequately supplied with ammunition.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the disasters attending the return of this expedition, the\r\nBritish Government, determined upon completing the exploration of the\r\nArctic coast line of the continent, satisfied itself that the route\r\noverland was the best for the explorers to follow, and Franklin, having\r\nbeen successful on this first trip in surveying a long stretch of coast\r\nto the east of Coppermine river, was appointed to the command of the\r\nsecond expedition to explore the coast to the west of that river. The\r\nexploring party spent the winter of 1825-26\r\n\r\n                            AT FORT FRANKLIN\r\n\r\nat the west end of Great Bear lake, and on June 22, 1826, set out in\r\nboats along Bear river and Mackenzie river for the coast. The principal\r\nmembers were Captain John Franklin, Lieutenant George Back (second in\r\ncommand); Doctor John Richardson, surgeon and naturalist; Thomas\r\nDrummond, assistant naturalist; E. N. Kendall and P. W. Dease, a chief\r\ntrader of the Hudson’s Bay Company, who was afterwards associated with\r\nThomas Simpson in explorations west of the Mackenzie and east of the\r\nCoppermine. At the delta of the Mackenzie the party separated, one\r\ndetachment under Doctor Richardson turning to the east and completing a\r\nsurvey of the coast as far as the mouth of the Coppermine. In the\r\nmeantime Franklin and Back explored the Arctic coast to the westward of\r\nthe Mackenzie for three hundred and seventy-four miles, passing beyond\r\nthe northernmost spur of Rocky mountains and returned to Fort Franklin,\r\nreaching there September 21. Franklin remained there until February,\r\n1827, when, leaving Back to follow him in the spring, he left for\r\nCumberland House, where he joined Richardson on June 18, 1827.[10]\r\n\r\nSome time before this expedition set forth, the crisis which had\r\ndeveloped in the rivalry between the Hudson’s Bay Company and the\r\nNorthwest Company[11] had resulted in the union of the two companies\r\nunder the name of the former and the reorganized company, when called\r\nupon by the Admiralty for assistance, was in a better position than the\r\noriginal one had ever been to assist in the work of exploration.\r\nConsequently Franklin’s second expedition was properly provisioned and\r\nattended by experienced and reliable men. As a result it was\r\nunaccompanied by any of the tragic occurrences which marked the former\r\ntrip.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile explorations were being prosecuted by sea among the Arctic\r\nislands and channels to the far north, and some of the expeditions were\r\nindirectly to contribute to the world’s knowledge of the northern part\r\nof the Hudson’s Bay Company’s continental territory. Captain John Ross\r\nleft England in the “Victory” in 1829 and with his ship’s company was\r\ncompelled to abandon the vessel in the ice in Regent inlet. They spent\r\naltogether four winters within the Arctic circle and were finally picked\r\nup in their boats in Lancaster sound by a whaler. The prolonged absence\r\nof this party caused great anxiety in England, and in 1833 a search\r\nexpedition was organized at the cost of the Hudson’s Bay Company and\r\nCaptain Ross’s friends with government assistance. At the head of the\r\nsearching party was Captain (afterwards Sir) George Back, R.N., who had\r\ninstructions to descend Thlew-ece-cho-dezeth or Great Fish river to the\r\ncoast, exploring the river and adjacent country, as far as possible, as\r\nhe proceeded. Some months after he had started, Back was notified of the\r\nreturn of the Ross expedition, but was ordered to proceed with his trip\r\nfor exploratory purposes. Captain Back built as his winter quarters\r\n\r\n                           OLD FORT RELIANCE\r\n\r\non a beautiful spot at the north east extremity of Great Slave lake. His\r\nexplorations extended over parts of Great Slave, Artillery,\r\nClinton-Colden and Aylmer lakes as well as the whole of Great Fish\r\nriver, and from the Indians Back obtained some interesting information\r\nregarding the adjacent country.\r\n\r\nCaptain Back, in 1834, descended Great Fish river, since called Backs\r\nriver, to its mouth. He also surveyed the coasts of its estuary as far\r\nas Cape Britannia on the one side and Point Richardson on the other,\r\nleaving but a small space of coast line unexamined between his northern\r\nextreme and the limits of earlier explorations. The return journey began\r\non August 16. Back reached the mouth of Great Fish river August 21, the\r\nhead of it on September 17, and Fort Reliance on September 27.\r\n\r\nThe next journey of exploration in this region was that of Thomas\r\nSimpson and Peter Warren Dease,[12] officers of the Hudson’s Bay\r\nCompany. While the object of their expedition was to complete the survey\r\nof the Arctic coast so nearly completed by Franklin, Richardson and\r\nBack, they made some notes on the natural resources of the far northern\r\ncountry. Simpson left Fort Garry, the site of the present city of\r\nWinnipeg, on December 1, 1836, and, travelling on snowshoes, arrived at\r\nChipewyan on June 1, and, descending Slave and Mackenzie rivers,\r\nexplored the Arctic coast westward to Point Barrow. They then returned\r\nto the Mackenzie, ascended it and Great Bear river, and, crossing Great\r\nBear lake, built a post near the mouth of Dease river, naming it Fort\r\nConfidence, and there spent the winter of 1837-38. They left here June\r\n6, 1838, and, after ascending Dease river as far as was practicable,\r\nportaged to the Coppermine. They then descended that river to the sea\r\nand explored the coast to the eastward as far as Point Turnagain, the\r\nfarthest point reached by Franklin in 1821. Being unable to proceed\r\nfarther, they returned to Fort Confidence, where they arrived on\r\nSeptember 14, and again wintered there.\r\n\r\nAn expedition which was to mark the beginning of a most notable epoch in\r\nthe explorations of the Arctic regions sailed from England, in 1845. Sir\r\nJohn Franklin, with two ships, the Erebus and the Terror, with crews\r\nnumbering one hundred and twenty-nine persons, left England on May 26,\r\nto complete the survey of the north coast of America and to accomplish\r\nthe northwest passage. The Erebus and the Terror were last seen by a\r\nwhaling captain July 26, 1845, moored to an iceberg, waiting for an\r\nopening in the ice to cross to Lancaster sound.\r\n\r\nAs time passed without any word of the missing expedition being\r\nreceived, the interest and sympathy of the world were powerfully\r\naroused, and not only England, but France and the United States also\r\ndespatched\r\n\r\n                           SEARCH EXPEDITIONS\r\n\r\nto the Arctic. From northwest Canada some historical expeditions made\r\ntheir way overland. In all thirty-five ships and five overland\r\nexpeditions were engaged in this search. The entire northern coast line\r\nof America and the shores of the Arctic[13] were explored with minute\r\ncare, and much scientific knowledge of value relating to magnetism,\r\nmeteorology, the tides, geology, botany and zoology was accumulated.\r\nSeveral of the sea expeditions and all of the overland expeditions\r\ncontributed to our store of knowledge as to the resources of far\r\nnorthern Canada.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this volume the most important of these expeditions,\r\nbecause the most productive of data regarding the natural resources of\r\nthe region under review, was that dispatched overland from Athabaska\r\ndistrict via Mackenzie river in 1848 and 1849. From the rapids of Slave\r\nriver, Doctor John Richardson and Doctor Rae (both subsequently\r\nknighted) pushed on with all possible speed, leaving the heavier boats\r\nto follow with the winter supplies, and skirted the Arctic coast\r\neastward to the mouth of the Coppermine river. Thence they travelled\r\noverland to the mouth of the Dease river on Great Bear lake. Near this\r\npoint, on the site of Fort Confidence, established by Dease and Simpson,\r\nRae, whose detachment had ascended Great Bear river and crossed Great\r\nBear lake for this purpose, had erected houses, and here the entire\r\nparty passed the winter of 1848-49. As early in the spring of 1849 as\r\nthe season allowed, the party divided on Arctic sea, and Richardson\r\nreturned to England, while Rae made an attempt to reach Wollaston land.\r\nFailing in this, he returned to Fort Confidence, and ascended the\r\nMackenzie to Fort Simpson. In the summer of 1854, under the auspices of\r\nthe Hudson’s Bay Company, Rae made a journey of exploration along the\r\nsouthern coasts of Wollaston and Victoria lands, still searching for the\r\nFranklin expedition. In 1853, when no trace of Franklin could be found\r\nelsewhere, Rae again turned his steps in the direction of Gulf of\r\nBoothia. First he sought a short cut to the south of Backs river by\r\nChesterfield inlet and Quoich river, which he ascended in a boat for two\r\nand a half degrees of latitude (up to 66° north), but finding the river\r\nfull of rapids and impracticable for his purpose, he returned and\r\nhastened north to Repulse bay.\r\n\r\nThe reports of these expeditions contain several references to the\r\nnatural resources of the country, but they are not so valuable as would\r\nhave been the case had time been less a consideration, or had the\r\ninvestigation of mineral deposits and other natural wealth of the\r\ncountry been the chief objective.\r\n\r\nSome information as to the resources of the north country was obtained\r\nby the British Parliamentary Committee of 1857 already referred to (See\r\np. 3), but most of the evidence had reference to the southern part of\r\nHudson’s Bay Company’s territory now comprised within the settled parts\r\nof the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta.\r\n\r\n                 CANADIAN PARLIAMENTARY INVESTIGATIONS.\r\n\r\nApril 12, 1870, the Senate of Canada appointed a select committee on the\r\nsubject of Rupert’s land, Red river and the Northwest territory, with a\r\nview to collecting information respecting the condition, climate, soil,\r\npopulation, resources and natural products of the country, its trade,\r\ninstitutions, and capabilities and the means of access thereto, with\r\npower to send for persons and papers. The committee reported on April\r\n25, 1870. This report with the report of the evidence was printed, in\r\nextenso, as an appendix to the Journals of the Senate (33 Victoria).\r\nNone of the witnesses examined before the committee had ever been in the\r\ndistrict north of the North Saskatchewan. One, Joseph Monkman, explained\r\nthat he had been up the South Saskatchewan as far as Moose lake, and up\r\nthe north branch of the same river as far as Carlton. He testified that\r\nalthough the country along the Saskatchewan looked promising from an\r\nagricultural standpoint, there were “no farms along the river.” Most of\r\nthe witnesses were asked if they had any information as to the “far\r\nnorthwest,” and all who had heard anything definite regarding that\r\nregion testified that their information was favourable.\r\n\r\nSince the transfer of the northwest from the Hudson’s Bay Company to the\r\nDominion Government, a vast amount of reliable information regarding the\r\ngreat northland has been obtained by Canadian Government explorers,\r\ngenerally engineers reconnoitring in advance of railway construction,\r\nmembers of the staff of the Geological Survey of Canada, or expeditions\r\ndespatched to various defined areas by the Department of the Interior\r\nfor the express purpose of investigating their natural resources and\r\ndetermining their suitability for agricultural or industrial\r\ndevelopments. More or less extensive trips through sections of the great\r\nnorthland by adventurous sportsmen and naturalists have also contributed\r\nconsiderably to our knowledge of the country.\r\n\r\nA very brief account of some of the more productive of these\r\nexpeditions, with special reference to the routes followed, is necessary\r\nto enable the reader to appreciate intelligently the references to the\r\ninformation obtained to be made in the succeeding chapters.\r\n\r\n                SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION OF THE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nIn 1872, Professor John Macoun was sent from Edmonton by Mr. (now Sir)\r\nSandford Fleming, who was then exploring for the Canadian Pacific\r\nRailway, to explore Peace river and see if there were a pass there.\r\nProfessor Macoun’s report attracted much attention to this district.\r\n\r\nProfessor Macoun had then already spent ten years study, theoretical and\r\npractical, of botany, natural history and physical geography. In the\r\nyear 1875 he was appointed botanist to the expedition which, under the\r\nleadership of the Director of the Geological Survey, explored Peace\r\nriver and Rocky mountains. Two years later he was asked by the Dominion\r\nGovernment to write a report on the Northwest territories and availed\r\nhimself of all reliable information regarding the country. The summers\r\nof 1879-80-81 were spent by Professor Macoun in traversing the least\r\nknown parts and investigating the fauna, flora, meteorology and physical\r\nphenomena of the country.\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1878-79 Doctor G. M. Dawson, of the Geological Survey,\r\nin conjunction with a Canadian Pacific Railway survey party, made an\r\nexamination of the region between the mouth of Skeena river on the\r\nPacific coast and Edmonton, including Pine river pass and its\r\napproaches, Smoky river and the fertile country north and south of Peace\r\nriver. The vast extent of country covered left but little time for\r\ndetails, and caused the expedition to assume the character of a rapid\r\nreconnaissance survey.\r\n\r\nIn 1873, Charles Horetzky, C.E., was commissioned by Mr. Sandford\r\nFleming to make a reconnaissance survey through Peace river country and\r\nPeace river pass to assist the government in reaching a decision as to\r\nthe route of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Mr. Horetzky, who was\r\naccompanied by Doctor Macoun, botanist, proceeded via Edmonton, Lesser\r\nSlave lake, the confluence of Smoky and Peace rivers, Dunvegan, McLeod’s\r\nlake, etc. Besides his official report, Mr. Horetzky wrote a popular\r\naccount of this trip under the title “Canada on the Pacific,” which\r\ncontained much interesting information as to Peace river district.\r\n\r\nIn 1875, Doctor Selwyn, Director of the Geological Survey, mapped and\r\nreported upon the upper part of Peace river, as far down as the mouth of\r\nSmoky river, and in the same year Professor John Macoun, who accompanied\r\nhim in the capacity of botanist, proceeded down the river to Lake\r\nAthabaska, and returned east by the Athabaska-Clearwater route, while\r\nDoctor Selwyn reascended Peace river, and returned by British Columbia.\r\n\r\nDoctor Robert Bell, F.G.S., F.R.S.C., etc., in a period of active\r\nservice in the Geological Survey extending over more than forty years,\r\ncontributed very largely to our knowledge of Northern Canada. He was\r\nmedical officer, naturalist and geologist on the “Neptune,” the “Alert”\r\nand the “Diana” expeditions to Hudson bay, and his reports of those\r\nvoyages, as well as of his overland trips, are very valuable. Three of\r\nhis exploratory trips, two in the eastern division, the other in the\r\nwestern part of the country under review, are especially interesting. In\r\n1878 he made a track-survey and a geological examination of the\r\nboat-route from Lake Winnipeg to Hudson bay by way of Oxford and Knee\r\nlakes, and the rivers thence to York Factory. He also made topographical\r\nand geological surveys of the lower part of Nelson river, and of the\r\nupper part of the same stream, from Lake Winnipeg nearly to Split lake,\r\nleaving unfinished the central part. Between 1878 and 1891 he explored\r\nNelson river, the lower part of Grass river, and parts of Churchill and\r\nLittle Churchill rivers. In 1879, Doctor Bell, assisted by Mr. Cochrane,\r\ncompleted his survey of Nelson river and Churchill river basins; the\r\ncountry covered in that region included altogether Gull lake, Grass\r\nriver, Sipiwesk lake, Jackfish river, Knee lake, God’s lake, Island\r\nlake, Split lake and the coast of Hudson bay for a few miles on either\r\nside of Churchill. These explorations practically re-opened a section of\r\ncountry which must have been familiar to those engaged in transportation\r\nvia the old route between Hudson bay, Red river and Saskatchewan river\r\ndistricts. Before reaching Norway House, although diligent enquiry was\r\nmade by Doctor Bell, no reliable information could be obtained of the\r\nChurchill, or the central part of the Nelson, or the country lying\r\nbetween these two streams. And even at Norway House very little was\r\nknown on the subject. This arose from the fact that both these rivers\r\nhad long before been abandoned as “voyaging” routes by the Hudson’s Bay\r\nCompany, and also that no Indians lived at or near the parts to be\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, a track survey and geological examination of Athabaska river\r\nbelow the mouth of Lac La Biche river, was made by Doctor Bell.\r\n\r\nIn 1886, Doctor Bell conducted an exploration of portions of\r\nAttawapiskat and Albany rivers, and of the country between Lonely lake\r\n(Lac Seul) and James bay. Doctor Bell reached the Albany from Wabigoon\r\nvia Lake Minnietakie, and crossed the watershed to the Attawapiskat from\r\nthe highest of the chain of lakes on the Eabamet, which flows into the\r\nAlbany about ninety miles in a straight line below the outlet of Lake\r\nSt. Joseph. The Attawapiskat was followed to James bay.\r\n\r\nA micrometer survey of the lower part of both Peace and Athabaska rivers\r\nwas made by William Ogilvie, D.L.S., in 1884, and in 1888, Mr. Ogilvie,\r\nhaving completed some surveys in the Yukon, arrived at Fort McPherson\r\nvia Peel river to make\r\n\r\n                   AN EXPLORATION OF MACKENZIE RIVER,\r\n\r\nGreat Slave lake and river, and Lake Athabaska. Mr. Ogilvie ascended\r\nthis great waterway and prepared a report which is still much consulted.\r\nIn 1891 Mr. Ogilvie, under the direction of the Surveyor-General, again\r\nmade an exploratory survey in the same region. Mr. Ogilvie’s\r\ninstructions were to make a thorough exploration of the region drained\r\nby Peace river and its tributaries, between the boundary of British\r\nColumbia and Rocky mountains and to collect any information that might\r\nbe of value relating to that region. As it was desirable that he should,\r\nif practicable, connect the end of his micrometer survey of Mackenzie\r\nriver made in 1888 with that made on Great Slave river in the same year,\r\nwhich he was then unable to accomplish on account of high water, Mr.\r\nOgilvie took with him the necessary instruments, but he found it\r\nimpossible to complete this work. This time, he descended the great\r\nnorthwestern waterway from Athabaska to Fort Simpson, and, ascending the\r\nLiard and “East Branch” or Nelson river, as it has since been officially\r\ncalled, reached Port Nelson on September 15, ascending Nelson and\r\nSikanni Chief rivers and portaging through the woods to St. John on\r\nPeace river. Another interesting report was the result of this really\r\nhazardous trip.\r\n\r\nIn 1886, Mr. A. P. Low of the Geological Survey, accompanied by Mr. J.\r\nM. Macoun, crossed Lake Winnipeg from Red river to Berens river and\r\nascended the latter to a portage to the head waters of Severn river,\r\nmaking an exploration of the country from Lake Winnipeg to Hudson bay.\r\n\r\nIn 1887, Mr. R. G. McConnell, B.A., of the Geological Survey, descended\r\nto Mackenzie river from the Yukon via Liard river, and during that year\r\nand the following one explored a considerable part of Mackenzie basin\r\nincluding Slave river, Salt river, Hay river, part of the western end of\r\nGreat Slave lake, etc. The result was embodied in a most interesting\r\nofficial report (Part D. Annual Report, Vol. IV., 1888-89, Geological\r\nSurvey of Canada.) The country between Peace and Athabaska rivers north\r\nof Lesser Slave lake, comprising an area of about forty-four thousand\r\nsquare miles, remained entirely unknown until Mr. McConnell’s\r\nexploration was undertaken.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1888, 1889, 1890 and 1891, Mr. McConnell effected a most\r\nimportant exploration of the unexplored country between Peace river and\r\nAthabaska river and in the basin of the Athabaska. He investigated as\r\nthoroughly as he could the phenomena of the so-called tar-sand deposits\r\nand the\r\n\r\n                    OIL SPRINGS OF ATHABASKA REGION,\r\n\r\nabout which the few hunters, traders and travellers who had hitherto\r\npenetrated so far had brought back such astonishing tales. His report,\r\nprinted in the annual report of the Geological Survey of Canada for\r\n1890-91 (New Series, Vol. V, Part I), excited much interest at the time\r\nthroughout the scientific world, and is still regarded as the standard\r\nauthority on the subject.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1889, a well-known English sportsman set out upon a\r\ntrip to Great Slave lake district with the object of making some\r\nexplorations. This was Mr. Warburton Pike, and his book “The Barren\r\nGround of Northern Canada”, describing his trip, gives a great deal of\r\ninteresting information about that part of the “Barren Lands” just north\r\nof Great Slave lake and the region about the headwaters of Backs river.\r\nMr. Pike, who combined the qualities of a good writer, a trained\r\nexplorer and a keen sportsman, proceeded during the summer of 1889 via\r\nGreat Slave lake and the canoe-portage route by Francois, de Mort, Nez\r\nCroche, du Rocher, Camsell, Mackay and de Gras lakes to the headwaters\r\nof Coppermine river. He spent the winter in camp just south of Mackay\r\nlake and at Fort Resolution, and the following summer proceeded via\r\nGreat Slave lake, and a chain of lakes to the east of those he had\r\ntraversed on his canoe-portage route the previous season, to Aylmer\r\nlake. Thence he proceeded down Backs river to Beechey lake, south of\r\nBathurst inlet. He came out via Clinton-Colden and Artillery lakes, and\r\nfrom Athabaska district made a trip up Peace river.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Burr Tyrrell, of the Geological Survey, explored the country\r\nbordering on the east shore of Lake Winnipeg in 1890 and 1891.\r\n\r\nIn 1892, Mr. Tyrrell, assisted by Mr. D. B. Dowling, made an exploration\r\nof the country between Athabaska and Churchill rivers and north of the\r\nlatter waterway. The routes covered included a course from Prince Albert\r\nnorthward through Cree lake and down Beaver river to Churchill river,\r\nand north across the country by Cree lake to Black river, thence through\r\nWollaston lake and up through Geikie and Foster rivers to the Churchill.\r\nIn 1893 and 1894 Mr. Tyrrell conducted two important exploration\r\nparties. In 1893 the route taken was via Chipewyan, Lake Athabaska, Fond\r\ndu Lac, Black lake, Chipman lake, Selwyn lake, Daly lake, Dubawnt river\r\nand lake, Aberdeen, Schultz and Baker lakes, Chesterfield inlet,\r\nChurchill, York Factory, Norway House and West Selkirk. In 1894 the\r\nroute followed was via Cumberland House, Sturgeon-weir river, Churchill\r\nriver, Reindeer river and lake, Cochrane river, Kasba lake, Kasba river,\r\nEnnadai lake, Kazan river, Kathkyed lake, Kazan river again, Ferguson\r\nlake and river to Hudson bay. Mr. Tyrrell and party came out via Split\r\nlake, Norway House and Selkirk.\r\n\r\n                          THE VAST WILDERNESS,\r\n\r\nthrough which the lines of exploration upon these occasions passed, lies\r\nfor the most part north of latitude 59°, and extends from the coast to\r\nHudson bay, westward to Lake Athabaska, comprising an area of not less\r\nthan two hundred thousand square miles. The work of the party embraced a\r\nsurvey of the north shore of Lake Athabaska, Chipman, Cochrane, Telzoa\r\nor Dubawnt, Thlewiaza, Kazan and Ferguson rivers, in whole or in part,\r\nChesterfield inlet, and the shore of Hudson bay from Chesterfield inlet\r\nto Churchill, as well as a line overland in winter, from Churchill to\r\nYork Factory, and another from Churchill to Split lake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portage near Long Spruce rapids, Nelson river.]\r\n\r\nThe distance travelled in 1893 was three thousand two hundred miles, one\r\nthousand six hundred and fifty of which had not been previously surveyed\r\nor reported on in any way. The whole distance of six hundred miles from\r\nChurchill to Lake Winnipeg was covered on snowshoes. During the trip of\r\nthe following year Mr. Tyrrell travelled two thousand nine hundred\r\nmiles, one thousand seven hundred and fifty by canoe and seven hundred\r\nand twenty-five on snowshoes, most of this distance being through\r\nunexplored country.\r\n\r\nJas. W. Tyrrell, C.E., D.L.S., who formed part of this expedition,\r\nsubsequently published a popular account of the trip of three thousand\r\ntwo hundred miles in a book entitled “Across the Sub-Arctics of Canada.”\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1896 Mr. Tyrrell, travelling by canoe, made a\r\nsurvey of the northeastern portion of the old district of Saskatchewan\r\nand the adjacent parts of the then district of Keewatin, since annexed\r\nto Manitoba, the territory covered comprising an area of rather more\r\nthan twenty-five thousand square miles, lying between north latitude 50°\r\n40′ and 56°, and west longitude 97° 20′ and 122° 30′.\r\n\r\nJames Macintosh Bell, F.R.G.S., of the Geological Survey of Canada, made\r\na geological reconnaissance of the north arm of Great Slave lake in\r\n1899, wintered at Fort Resolution, and in 1900, accompanied by Mr.\r\nCharles Camsell, travelled to Great Bear lake, made a geological\r\nexploration of its northern shores, and returned by a chain of lakes to\r\nthe north arm of Great Slave lake, proceeding to Edmonton the same\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1899, Mr. D. B. Dowling of the Geological Survey\r\nexplored the upper part of Burntwood river from Three Point lake to its\r\nhead near Reed lake, Kississing river, from the north end of\r\nAthapapuskow lake to its mouth on Churchill river, and the Churchill\r\nfrom above Sisipuk lake to the end of the long arm running from Nelson\r\nlake. During the summer of 1893 Mr. Dowling conducted an exploration in\r\nthat part of southern Keewatin just to the east of the then eastern\r\nboundary of Manitoba, and north of the then northern boundary of\r\nOntario. The area covered, now forming part of the province of Ontario,\r\nextends from English river and Lac Seul northwards to Berens river, the\r\neastern branch of which forms approximately the northern limit of the\r\narea. To the east the exploration included the heads of streams flowing\r\neastward to Cat lake, and on the west White river, a southern branch of\r\nBerens river, with the western end of Red lake, confines its extent in\r\nthat direction.\r\n\r\nIn 1900, J. W. Tyrrell, C.E., D.L.S., who had been assistant to his\r\nbrother in 1893, conducted an important exploration of the country\r\nbetween Great Slave lake and Chesterfield inlet on Hudson bay. In all,\r\none thousand seven hundred and twenty-nine miles of survey were\r\naccomplished, and in the performance of this four thousand six hundred\r\nmiles were travelled\r\n\r\n                         WITH SLEDS AND CANOES.\r\n\r\nMr. Tyrrell proceeded via Resolution, Great Slave lake, old Fort\r\nReliance, Lockhart river, Pike’s portage, Artillery lake, Clinton-Colden\r\nlake, Smart lake, Sifton lake, Hanbury river and Thelon river to a point\r\nnear the confluence of Dubawnt river. Hence a portion of the party under\r\nthe direction of C. C. Fairchild, C.E., was despatched to survey\r\nAberdeen, Schultz and Baker lakes, while Mr. Tyrrell returned up the\r\nThelon to devote his attention to the upper part of the river and the\r\ndivide between the upper Thelon and Artillery lake, traversing,\r\nunattended, the one hundred and sixty miles between a small branch of\r\nthe Thelon and Artillery lake. The party was reunited at Artillery lake,\r\nand returned to civilization via Resolution, Chipewyan and Edmonton.\r\n\r\nIn 1898, Mr. David T. Hanbury tried to reach the unexplored tract\r\nbetween Chesterfield inlet and Great Slave lake via the\r\nNorway-House—York-Factory—Churchill route. Finding that he arrived too\r\nlate at the latter place, he decided to spend the summer on the Hudson\r\nbay coast and make preparations for an early start the following year.\r\nIn 1899, he made an interesting trip from Churchill to Great Slave lake\r\nvia Chesterfield inlet, Thelon and Ark-i-linik rivers, Clinton-Colden\r\nand Artillery lakes, and Lockhart river. As he was the first white man\r\nto explore Ark-i-linik or Thelon river, its most western affluent has\r\nsince been called Hanbury river. In 1901, Mr. Hanbury travelled from\r\nEdmonton to Depot island in the northern part of Hudson bay, via Fort\r\nResolution, Great Slave lake, Artillery lake, Hanbury, Thelon and\r\nDubawnt rivers, Baker lake, Chesterfield inlet and Marble island. He\r\nspent most of the winter in an Esquimaux camp near Baker lake, and in\r\nFebruary started on an adventurous trip back to civilization via\r\nAberdeen lake and Thelon river, thence overland to Buchanan river, down\r\nthat stream to Backs river, thence to the coast, westward along the\r\ncoast to the mouth of the Coppermine, up the Coppermine to Kendall\r\nriver, via Dismal lake, Dease river, Great Bear lake and Great Bear\r\nriver to Fort Norman. Mr. Hanbury gives an interesting account of these\r\ntrips in his book “Sport and Travel in the Northland of Canada.”\r\n\r\nThe United States Biological Survey, in the early spring of 1901,\r\ndetermined to send Mr. Edward A. Preble, Assistant of the Survey and one\r\nof its trained field naturalists, to obtain representative collections\r\nof the mammals, birds and plants of the great interior region west of\r\nHudson bay drained mainly by the Mackenzie and described in the reports\r\nof the Survey as the most neglected large area in North America. As it\r\nwas evident that only part of the region could be examined\r\nsatisfactorily in a single season, it was determined to make first a\r\nreconnaissance of the region about Athabaska and Great Slave lakes. The\r\nroute followed by Mr. Preble’s party was via Great Slave lake, including\r\nthe north arm, to Fort Rae; the chain of lakes and rivers by way of Lake\r\nSt. Croix to MacTavish bay; Great Bear lake and Great Bear river to the\r\nMackenzie. It had been the intention of Mr. Preble, who was accompanied\r\nby his brother and Mr. James MacKinley, formerly of the Hudson’s Bay\r\nCompany, to cross by one of the Indian routes to the upper Coppermine\r\nand to descend that stream, but various circumstances rendered this\r\nimpossible and he was obliged to take the shorter and more westerly\r\nroute.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1903, the results of his work in 1901 having been\r\nelaborated but not published, Mr. Preble was sent to complete his\r\ninvestigations in the Mackenzie region. This was especially desirable,\r\nsince on the previous trip he had penetrated only as far as Great Slave\r\nlake. Upon his second trip the survey was carried from Great Bear lake\r\nto the Arctic coast line. The result of these trips was embodied in a\r\nvery complete and altogether admirable report—“North American Fauna,\r\nNo. 27.”—published by the United States Biological Survey in 1908.\r\n\r\nIn 1905, Mr. Alfred H. Harrison, one of that large class of adventurous\r\nEnglishmen who love to penetrate into the less known and totally unknown\r\nportions of the world for the very love of sport and perilous adventure,\r\nmade a trip of exploration down Slave and Mackenzie rivers, and remained\r\nfor nearly two years in the country\r\n\r\n                   ABOUT THE DELTA OF MACKENZIE RIVER\r\n\r\nand Herschell island, and returned home in 1907 by the same route. Mr.\r\nHarrison, before he made this trip, had considerable knowledge of the\r\nNorthland, for he had made a trip as far as Great Slave lake in 1902.\r\nMr. Harrison is, moreover, the son of a former officer of the Hudson’s\r\nBay Company, who in 1852 was stationed at the company’s post at Fort\r\nGood Hope. Mr. Harrison, upon his return to England, wrote a book which\r\nhe entitled “In Search of a Polar Continent” which contains a large\r\namount of interesting information regarding the Mackenzie country.\r\n\r\nDuring the seasons of 1903, 1904 and 1905, Mr. William McInnes of the\r\nGeological Survey made explorations in that portion of the southeastern\r\nsection of this region drained by Winisk river and by the upper branches\r\nof Attawapiskat river. These explorations extended from 51° 10′ to 55°\r\n10′ North latitude and from 86° to 90° West longitude. The result was\r\nembodied in a report printed in 1909 and numbered 1080.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Wm. McInnes and Owen O’Sullivan of the Geological Survey were\r\nemployed during the summer of 1906 to explore the region along the\r\nproposed route of the railway between the Saskatchewan and Churchill.\r\nMr. McInnes explored the country between the Pas and Split lake; Mr.\r\nO’Sullivan, the country between Split lake and Churchill. Their reports\r\nwere published in the summary report of the Geological Survey for 1906.\r\n\r\nMr. McInnes’s route ran from Lake Winnipeg via Nelson river to Split\r\nlake and thence along Burntwood river and File river and lake to Reed\r\nlake, across Wekusko lake to a point between Grass and Burntwood rivers,\r\nback to Reed lake and thence along the Nelson. Mr. O’Sullivan’s route\r\nwas from Split lake via Assean lake, Outawi river and lake, Waskaiowaka\r\nlake, Little Churchill river, Recluse lake, Great Churchill river, Deer\r\nlake and river, and Great Churchill river again. The return trip was\r\nmade via York Factory, Hayes river and Fox river.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 and 1907, W. Thibaudeau, C.E., acting under the instruction of\r\nDoctor Deville, Surveyor-General, made some explorations in Churchill\r\ndistrict and along the route of the proposed Hudson Bay Railway from\r\nChurchill to The Pas on the Saskatchewan. On his trip over the route of\r\nthe railway Mr. Thibaudeau proceeded from Churchill in a straight line\r\nto near Deer river. Crossing the river he followed a route between it\r\nand the Churchill, recrossing the Deer at a point a little more than a\r\nhundred miles from Churchill. Thence he travelled in a straight line to\r\nthe Little Churchill, and followed the course of that river to\r\nWaskaiowaka lake. Thence he crossed to a point near Assean lake and\r\ncontinued his route via Split lake, Pipe lake, Grass river, Landing\r\nlake, Sipiwesk lake, Grass river, and Cormorant and Atikomeg lakes.\r\n\r\nMr. Joseph Keele of the Geological Survey of Canada made a\r\nreconnaissance across Mackenzie mountains on Pelly, Ross and Gravel\r\nrivers, in the mountain region lying between the Pelly and the lower\r\nreach of Mackenzie river in 1907 and 1908.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1908, Inspector E. A. Pelletier, of the Royal\r\nNorthwest Mounted Police, with a corporal and two constables, patrolled\r\nthe country between\r\n\r\n                    GREAT SLAVE LAKE AND HUDSON BAY.\r\n\r\nThey left Fort Resolution on Great Slave lake on July 1 and travelled\r\nvia Pike portage, Artillery lake, Hanbury river and Thelon river, to\r\nHudson bay at Chesterfield inlet, where they arrived on August 31. No\r\nnatives or guides were employed from Great Slave lake to Hudson bay and\r\nthis portion of the journey was made without any mishap whatever.\r\n\r\nInspector Pelletier estimated the distances travelled on this patrol as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n                                                              Miles.\r\n      Fort Saskatchewan to Athabaska (teams)                      90\r\n      Athabaska to McMurray (scow)                               280\r\n      McMurray to Graham’s Landing (steamer)                     290\r\n      Graham’s Landing to Fort Smith (teams)                      12\r\n      Fort Smith to Fort Resolution (canoes)                     180\r\n      Fort Resolution to Fort Reliance (canoes)                  240\r\n      Pike portage route between Great Slave lake\r\n        and Artillery lake (portage and canoe)                    25\r\n      Artillery lake to height of land (portage and canoe)       100\r\n      Height of land to Thelon river (portage and canoe)         170\r\n      Thelon river (canoe)                                       220\r\n      Beverly lake and river (canoe)                              35\r\n      Aberdeen lake (canoe)                                       60\r\n      River between Aberdeen and Schultz lakes (canoe)            20\r\n      Schultz lake (canoe)                                        25\r\n      Schultz or Lower Thelon river (portage and canoe)           35\r\n      Baker lake (canoe)                                          60\r\n      River foot of Baker lake (canoe)                            25\r\n      Chesterfield inlet, Hudson bay (canoe)                     130\r\n                                                                  ==\r\n      Total                                                    1,997\r\n\r\nOf the canoes used on this patrol, one was an eighteen foot length,\r\nforty-two inch beam, the other eighteen and one-half foot length,\r\nforty-three inch beam; both were eighteen inches deep, longitudinal\r\nstrip cedar, varnished, fitted with oars for hard pulling against strong\r\nwinds on the lakes. Inspector Pelletier had a good stock of paddles and\r\nfifty-five foot lateen sails. Each canoe weighed one hundred and twenty\r\npounds portaging weight. The portage from Great Slave lake towards\r\nArtillery lake was found to be about six miles from the site of Fort\r\nReliance, of which historic establishment a stone chimney alone remains\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\nSome interesting topographical information regarding the region between\r\nHudson bay and The Pas was obtained through the surveys made under the\r\ndirection of John Armstrong, C.E., for the Department of Railways and\r\nCanals in 1908 and 1909, for the purpose of determining a projected\r\nlocation for a railway to Hudson bay from The Pas, the nearest point on\r\nthe Saskatchewan then having railway connection. From The Pas to a point\r\nnorth of Pipestone lake a single route was laid down; thence two routes,\r\none to Port Nelson, the other to Churchill, were surveyed. Mr.\r\nArmstrong, in his report (Sessional Paper No. 20 d.—1910), makes some\r\ninteresting references to the natural resources of the district covered\r\nby the surveys.\r\n\r\nAll the expeditions which have been thus briefly passed in review made\r\nadditions to the knowledge we possess of the natural resources of the\r\ngreat unsettled Northwest, but it will be observed that the acquisition\r\nof geographical knowledge only was the object for which most of these\r\nexpeditions were equipped and sent forward. The trained explorers of the\r\nGeological Survey of Canada have given us a fair idea of the geological\r\nfeatures and natural resources generally along the more accessible lines\r\nof travel, particularly in the southern and western parts of this vast\r\nunsettled and unsurveyed region, but it is only within the last few\r\nyears that systematic surveys have been undertaken there to determine\r\nthe adaptability of certain areas to agricultural development and\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nIn 1908, Frank J. P. Crean, C.E., of the Railway Lands Branch of the\r\nDepartment of the Interior, was commissioned to explore and procure all\r\nthe information possible about that tract of country lying to the east\r\nof Beaver river and Green lake,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Farm at Mount Nebo on Green lake trail, sixty-five miles\r\nfrom Prince Albert.]\r\n\r\n                       SOUTH OF CHURCHILL RIVER,\r\n\r\nand extending east to the old canoe route from Cumberland House via Frog\r\nportage to Stanley Mission. Mr. Crean was instructed by Mr. R. E. Young,\r\nSuperintendent of the Railway Lands Branch, to pay particular attention\r\nto obtaining information about the character of the country away from\r\nthe travelled routes, and to ascertain the value of the district to be\r\ntraversed for farming, lumbering and mining purposes.\r\n\r\nMr. Crean left Prince Albert August 20, 1908, and returned there January\r\n6, 1909. He proceeded by team to the south end of Green lake, and after\r\nreaching that point travelled chiefly by canoe, making side trips\r\ninland, where it seemed desirable to do so. After the ice formed he\r\nprocured dog trains to continue the exploration. On this trip Mr. Crean\r\nexplored the district bounded on the west by a line from Prince Albert\r\nto Stanley mission; on the north by Churchill and Clearwater rivers; on\r\nthe west by Green lake, Beaver river, the western arm of Ile à la Crosse\r\nlake, Buffalo lake, Methye river and Methye lake; and on the south by\r\nthe surveyed territory along the north bank of the Saskatchewan. Mr.\r\nCrean gave the following statistics in his report:—“The gross area\r\nexplored, and about which some information has been collected, is\r\napproximately sixteen million acres. The water covered area in this\r\ntract (area of lakes and rivers) may be set down at approximately three\r\nmillion acres—the remaining land area at thirteen million. I would\r\nestimate that an area of fully three million five hundred thousand acres\r\nis suitable for settlement as soon as surveyed and made accessible by\r\nroads, and an area of about eight million acres of swamp or land\r\nprobably too wet at present for successful cultivation could be\r\nreclaimed at a moderate expenditure. All swamp will, however, eventually\r\nrepay the cost of reclamation. The above figures are, of course, the\r\nresult of an exploration extending over only a few months, and must be\r\nconsidered to be only approximate. The distance travelled was about\r\nthree thousand miles, of which one thousand two hundred was made running\r\nbehind dog trains.”\r\n\r\nIn 1909, Mr. Crean was again sent out to carry on his exploration of the\r\ncountry north of the surveyed area in Saskatchewan and Alberta and\r\nextending west from the territory covered the previous year. He was\r\ninstructed to cover as much of the country west to the Athabaska and\r\n\r\n                        NORTH TO THE CLEARWATER\r\n\r\nas time would permit. He left Prince Albert on June 17, 1909, completed\r\nhis season’s work at McMurray, and thence proceeded to Edmonton,\r\nreaching there December 11, 1909. From Green lake, Mr. Crean travelled\r\nprincipally by canoe, making numerous portages, some of considerable\r\nlength. On some occasions he hired horses and used them as a means of\r\ntransportation. The total area explored, or about which information was\r\nthus obtained, is approximately twenty-one million acres. Mr. Crean\r\nreports:—“Of this tract, not over two million acres is covered by\r\nwater—lakes and rivers. A conservative estimate of the land available\r\nfor settlement in its present state, when means of access are provided,\r\nwould be about ten million acres. The greater portion of the remaining\r\narea, say nine million acres, could be drained, and, in my opinion,\r\nwould well repay the expenditure. Throughout the tract there is ample\r\nfall which would allow of drainage being successfully carried out. A\r\nportion of the tract lies on the head waters of Churchill river, and all\r\nthe streams contain numerous rapids and falls. On the west side of the\r\nheight of land sloping towards the Athabaska and the Clearwater there\r\nare also excellent facilities for drainage. This tract is well supplied\r\nwith timber, some of which may be suitable for export.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crean, during this exploratory trip, visited the country between\r\nGreen lake and Meadow lake, Birch lake and Loon lake to the westward;\r\nWaterhen lake and Island lake; Canoe lake and Burnt lake; White Fish\r\nriver and lake, and Watchush lake; Gipsy lake, Gordon lake and McMurray;\r\nGregoire lake. Pembina river. Cowpar lake, Winefred lake, Ipiatik lake,\r\nHeart lake and Lac La Biche, all to the westward of the area\r\ninvestigated in 1908.\r\n\r\nMr. Crean’s report of his exploration in the season of 1908 was printed\r\nfor public information, but owing to the great demand for copies the\r\nedition was soon exhausted and it was decided therefore, to issue the\r\ntwo reports in one new publication. The gross area covered by the two\r\nreports, and as to which some information was gathered, might be stated\r\nat approximately forty million acres.\r\n\r\nInspired with the wish to see for himself the country for the\r\nadministration of which he was responsible, the Hon. Frank Oliver, then\r\nMinister of the Interior, in 1910 made the trip from Edmonton via\r\nAthabaska, Athabaska river, Lake Athabaska, Slave river, Great Slave\r\nlake, and Mackenzie river, to Fort McPherson, thence passing over to the\r\nYukon by trail to Lapierre’s House. Mr. Oliver left Edmonton June 2 and\r\nreached Fort Yukon on July 14. From Athabaska to Grand rapids (one\r\nhundred and sixty miles) and from McMurray to Chipewyan (two hundred\r\nmiles) the Minister and his private secretary made the trip alone in a\r\nPeterborough canoe. The result of the Minister’s observations, as\r\ncommunicated to the press, aroused considerable interest in the newest\r\nnorthwest throughout Canada.\r\n\r\nThe reports of explorers and travellers as to the character and\r\nresources of the great northwest have been supplemented by a\r\nconsiderable amount of information received from Hudson’s Bay Company\r\nofficials, and others engaged in the fur trade, missionaries,\r\nprospectors and pioneer settlers. Certain\r\n\r\n                     RECENT PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRIES\r\n\r\nresulted in the placing upon record of some of the most instructive of\r\nthis class of information.\r\n\r\nMuch data of a most valuable character was obtained by two select\r\ncommittees of the Senate which sat during the sessions of 1887 and 1888,\r\nunder the presidency of the late Honourable Senator Schultz, who was\r\nmainly instrumental in having the said committees appointed. The reports\r\nof these committees, with the evidence taken, were printed as appendices\r\nto the Journals of the Senate (1st Session, 6th Parlt., 50 Victoria, and\r\n2nd Session, 6th Parlt., 51 Victoria).\r\n\r\nDuring the parliamentary session of 1906-7, the Hon. Senator T. O.\r\nDavis, of Prince Albert, was instrumental in having a select committee\r\nof the Senate appointed to enquire as to the value of that portion of\r\nthe Dominion lying north of the Saskatchewan watershed and east of Rocky\r\nmountains, comprising the northern parts of the provinces of Alberta and\r\nSaskatchewan and Mackenzie territory, and the extent of navigable\r\nwaters, rivers, lakes, and sea-coast contained therein; also similarly\r\nto enquire and report from time to time as to the value of the portions\r\nof the Dominion on both sides of Hudson bay, including the territories\r\nof Keewatin and Ungava, and the extent of navigable waters, rivers,\r\nlakes and sea-coast contained therein. The committee, in accordance with\r\nthe authority delegated to it, sent for persons, papers and records\r\nbearing upon the subjects submitted for its consideration, and examined\r\na number of gentlemen possessing special knowledge, through personal\r\nexperience or otherwise, of the regions named as the special subject of\r\nenquiry. The evidence thus obtained was, under instructions from the\r\nSenate, edited, condensed and arranged by the compiler of the present\r\nvolume, and published, first in the journals of the Senate (3rd Session,\r\n10th Parliament), and subsequently in the book published under the\r\ndirection of the Department of the Interior, entitled “Canada’s Fertile\r\nNorthland.” It aroused much interest in the subject, not only in Canada,\r\nbut throughout the civilized world.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of this, the Minister of the Interior gave instructions\r\nfor the preparation of a summary or digest of the Schultz committee\r\nreports of 1887 and 1888, at that time out of print, the work being\r\nentrusted to the same compiler, under the direction of the late Mr. R.\r\nE. Young, Superintendent of Railway Lands and Chief Geographer. The\r\nresult was the volume “The Great Mackenzie Basin”, the first edition of\r\nwhich was published in 1908.\r\n\r\nAltogether, from one source or another, during the three centuries which\r\nhave elapsed since the British flag first appeared in Hudson bay, a vast\r\namount of reliable information, covering many widely-separated districts\r\nof the territory under review, has been obtained; but hitherto much of\r\nthe practical value of this useful data scattered through the pages of\r\npublications of various descriptions has been lost for\r\n\r\n                    LACK OF SYSTEMATIC COMPILATION.\r\n\r\nIn bringing all this information together and compressing it within the\r\nlimits of one volume, a difficulty presents itself in the tremendous\r\nextent of country concerned.\r\n\r\nIn arranging the matter of this volume, with a view to enabling the\r\nreader to follow more readily, the whole area under review has been\r\ndivided into certain arbitrary geographical sub-divisions. In a region\r\nso vast, the differences of climate, soil and general physical character\r\nof the country in the various districts are very considerable, and\r\nemphasize the necessity of treating certain geographical sub-divisions\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nA glance at the map is necessary to enable the reader to understand the\r\ndivisions of the country which it has been deemed advisable to make in\r\nprojecting this volume, to permit of the intelligent treatment of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe region designated “The Keewatin Area” comprises that part of what\r\nwas formerly the provisional district of Keewatin which lies east of the\r\nprovince of Saskatchewan, south of the 60th parallel of north latitude,\r\nwest of James bay and southwest and west of Hudson bay. Its southern\r\nlimits are defined by the former (up to 1912) northern boundary of\r\nManitoba and the former (up to the same date) northwesterly boundary of\r\nOntario.\r\n\r\nDuring the first session of the 12th Parliament of Canada (1911-12) the\r\nwhole of this territory was annexed to the two provinces lying\r\nimmediately to the south of it, Ontario and Manitoba. The dividing line\r\nbetween the portion of the former district of Keewatin annexed to the\r\nprovince of Ontario, and that annexed to the province of Manitoba, is\r\ndescribed in the legislation extending the boundaries of the two\r\nprovinces as a line from the extreme north end of the eastern boundary\r\nof the province of Manitoba as it existed at the time of the extension\r\nof boundaries, “thence continuing due north along the same meridian to\r\nthe intersection thereof with the centre of the road allowance on the\r\ntwelfth base line of the system of Dominion Land Surveys; thence\r\nnortheasterly in a right line to the most eastern point of Island lake,\r\nas shown in approximate latitude 53° 30′ and longitude 93° 40′ on the\r\nrailway map of the Dominion of Canada, published, on the scale of\r\nthirty-five miles to one inch, in the year one thousand nine hundred and\r\neight, by the authority of the Minister of the Interior; thence\r\nnortheasterly in a right line to the point where the eighty-ninth\r\nmeridian of west longitude intersects the southern shore of Hudson bay;\r\nthence easterly and southerly following the shore of the said bay to the\r\npoint where the northerly boundary of the province of Ontario as\r\nestablished under the said Act intersects the shore of James bay.”\r\n\r\nAt the date of the final revision of these pages for the press, the\r\ndivision of the territory was too recent to permit of effective separate\r\ntreatment of newest Ontario and newest Manitoba as separate territorial\r\nunits, and any attempt to effect such separate treatment, it was felt,\r\nwould only result in confusion.\r\n\r\nThe “Northern Saskatchewan Region” comprises the whole of the province\r\nof Saskatchewan, north of the surveyed area.\r\n\r\nThe “Northern Alberta Region” comprises the whole of the province of\r\nAlberta, north and east of the surveyed area.\r\n\r\nThe “Mackenzie River Region” includes all the territory in the great\r\nMackenzie basin, north of the province of Alberta, extending northward\r\nto Beaufort sea, west to the boundary of Yukon territory, and eastward\r\nto the basin of Coppermine river, that of Yellowknife river, a line in\r\nprolongation of the latter stream across Great Slave lake and following\r\nthe right bank of Slave river to the northern boundary of Alberta.\r\n\r\nThe area comprised within the designation “The Barren Lands” includes\r\nthe immense territory extending eastwards from that last defined to\r\nHudson bay, and including the bare, treeless, but wrongly called “Barren\r\nLands.”\r\n\r\nWith this brief and general outline of the various districts before him,\r\nthe reader will more readily follow the attempt to present in a\r\nsystematic and intelligible form all the data of practical value\r\navailable regarding the varied natural resources of this vast territory.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[1] At the Semple murder trials at York in October, 1818, Sherwood, the\r\nNorthwest Company’s counsel, ironically described Red river valley\r\n(Manitoba) as the “land of milk and honey, where nothing, not even a\r\nblade of corn, will ripen.”\r\n\r\n[2] “The nations of Europe had adopted the principle that discovery gave\r\ntitle to the government by whose subjects or by whose authority it was\r\nmade, against all other European governments, which title might be\r\nconsummated by possession.” (Chief Justice Marshall.)\r\n\r\n[3] This was the same Henry Kelsey who showed conspicuous bravery at the\r\ncapture of Fort Nelson by the French under d’Iberville in 1690, and who\r\nsubsequently became a Deputy Governor in the Hudson’s Bay service.—(E.\r\nJ. C.).\r\n\r\n[4] “The Last Great Monopoly.”\r\n\r\n[5] Joseph Robson, who had been employed as a stone mason and engineer\r\nin the construction of Fort Prince of Wales at Churchill between 1733\r\nand 1748, and had been up Nelson river for a distance of forty or fifty\r\nmiles, was one of the chief witnesses. Being asked as to the number of\r\nBritish subjects in the Company’s settlements, he said that the first\r\nyear he was at York Fort there were 36 persons there, and at Churchill\r\n44 or 45; that he never saw any British subjects there, except the\r\nCompany’s servants, nor any other people desirous to “fix” there, or\r\nthat the Company had ever offered encouragement to British subjects to\r\n“settle” there. He expressed the opinion that some of the country about\r\nHudson bay might be settled and inhabited, if people would go up the\r\nrivers till they found a better climate, and there erect settlements. He\r\ndeclared that he did not doubt that he himself could find three or four\r\nhundred British subjects, who would willingly go there to live winter\r\nand summer, and, he added, he would go for one. He added that speaking\r\nfrom his own experience, the cold of the Hudson bay winter might be\r\nendured without any inconvenience, their clothing being adapted to the\r\nclimate. He had suffered more from cold in England, than ever he did at\r\nHudson bay. It was true that flesh will freeze, but he never knew any\r\nperson to lose his fingers from frostbite at Churchill or York.\r\n\r\n[6] In 1773 Hearne established Cumberland House as a southern outpost of\r\nthe Hudson’s Bay Company. It was Hearne, the hero of this daring trip of\r\nexploration, who, as governor of Prince of Wales fort (Churchill), in\r\n1782, ignominiously surrendered that stronghold to the French squadron\r\nunder La Pérouse, without firing a shot.\r\n\r\n[7] Governor Morton’s instructions to Hearne set forth the object of the\r\nexpedition in detail. They included the following:—\r\n\r\n“The Indians who are now appointed your guides, are to conduct you to\r\nthe border of the Athapapuscow (Great Slave lake) and Indians’ country,\r\nwhere Captain Matonabbee (an Indian chief) is to meet you in the spring\r\nof one thousand seven hundred and seventy, in order to conduct you to a\r\nriver represented by the Indians to abound with copper ore, animals of\r\nthe fur kind, etc., and which is said to be so far to the northward that\r\nin the middle of the summer the sun does not set, and is supposed by the\r\nIndians to empty itself into some ocean. This river, which is called by\r\nthe Northern Indians Neetha-San-San-Dazey, or Far Off Metal river, you\r\nare, if possible, to trace to the mouth, and there determine the\r\nlatitude and longitude as near as you can; but more particularly so if\r\nyou find it navigable; and that a settlement can be made there with any\r\ndegree of safety, or benefit to the Company.”\r\n\r\n“Be careful to observe what mines are near the river; what water there\r\nis at the river’s mouth; how far the woods are from the sea-side; the\r\ncourse of the river; the nature of the soil and the productions of it;\r\nand make any other remarks that you may think will be either necessary\r\nor satisfactory. And if the said river be likely to be of any utility,\r\ntake possession of it on behalf of the Hudson’s Bay Company, by cutting\r\nyour name on some of the rocks, as also the date of the year, month,\r\netc.”\r\n\r\n[8] A synopsis of the account of Hearne’s journey was published in\r\npamphlet form in 1773 and re-published in 1778-80, the complete account\r\nbeing published in book form in 1790. (Beckles Wilson.)\r\n\r\n[9] The history of the Peace and Athabaska country commences in 1778,\r\nwhen Peter Pond, subsequently a partner in the Northwest Company,\r\npushing northwestward in search of new fur districts, reached the\r\nAthabaska by way of Methye portage and Clearwater river, and descending\r\nit, founded a fort known as “The Old Establishment,” about thirty miles\r\nabove its mouth. In 1788 this post was abandoned, and a new one built on\r\nthe south side of Lake Athabaska, on what is now known as “Old Fort\r\nPoint.” Still later, this site was also deserted and a better one\r\nselected on the north shore, near the outlet of the lake. A general map\r\nof the Northwest was published by Peter Pond in 1785.\r\n\r\nPeter Pond’s venture proved extremely remunerative, and he was followed\r\nby other traders who gradually spread themselves over the then unknown\r\ncountry to the north and west. (J. M. McConnell’s report.)\r\n\r\n[10] In 1827 Franklin returned from the northwest via Lake Winnipeg, the\r\ngreat lakes and Ottawa river. In passing Ottawa, in August, he laid the\r\ncornerstone of the lowest tier of locks on Rideau canal.\r\n\r\n[11] The English Government, in 1821, after the union of the Northwest\r\nCompany with the Hudson’s Bay Company, granted the reorganized company a\r\nlicense of exclusive trade over the country to the west of the watershed\r\nof Hudson bay, or Rupert’s Land. The license was renewed in 1838.\r\n\r\n[12] Dease was one of the Company’s chief factors; Simpson, who was a\r\ncousin of Sir George Simpson, was an accurate astronomical observer.\r\n\r\n[13] In all, 21,500 miles of coast line of which 5,780 miles were\r\npreviously unknown, had been examined.

These posts were established and have since been\r\nmaintained entirely for the purpose of the fur trade, and consequently\r\nno settlements have sprung up around them, and there has been no\r\nsystematic attempt to exploit the agricultural possibilities of the\r\nadjacent areas. Nevertheless, it was some of the older servants of the\r\nbig fur company who first drew attention to the fact that this region\r\nhad agricultural possibilities, and it was from the posts on the bay\r\nthat the first explorations of the interior were made. Of recent years,\r\nmuch information as to the agricultural possibilities of this area has\r\nbeen obtained by explorers of the Geological Survey of Canada, and\r\nthrough the explorations attendant upon the surveys for the location of\r\nthe Hudson Bay Railway, which is projected to run in a northeasterly\r\ndirection across this region from The Pas to Port Nelson.\r\n\r\nThe main object of those who secured the appointment of a select\r\ncommittee of the British House of Commons in 1749, to inquire into the\r\ncondition of the Hudson bay territory and the trade carried on there\r\n(See page 8), was to secure the cancellation of the Company’s monopoly\r\nand to throw the country open to settlement. With this object in view\r\nmuch evidence was produced to show that the territory offered\r\ninducements to colonists, and, as inscribed in the pages of the official\r\nreport, this gives us the earliest account of pioneer agriculture in\r\nthis region, and an idea of the possibilities of the country from the\r\nold timers’ points of view.\r\n\r\nMr. Richard White, one of the witnesses examined before the committee,\r\nsaid that he went to Albany Fort in the year 1726, as clerk to the\r\nCompany, and remained there seven years, and that he had been ten years\r\nat Churchill, which was the northernmost fort. He testified that “the\r\nGovernor at Albany had a garden in which peas, beans, turnips and salad\r\ngrew as well and plentiful as in England, but he never knew of seed\r\nraised in that country to have been sown again. He saw a small quantity\r\nof barley growing near Moose river in August, which is about two months\r\nbefore the cold weather, which barley was in the ear, but not full, but\r\nas he has never been used to tillage, he is a very indifferent judge in\r\nthose matters.”\r\n\r\nMr. White stated that “he apprehended the countries adjoining to Hudson\r\nbay might be settled and improved, and that in the southern parts, oats,\r\nbarley and peas would grow, but if persons were allowed to settle, he\r\ndid not apprehend they could at first subsist by the cultivation of\r\nlands only he did not know why the Company did not grow their own corn,\r\nnor whether any proposal had been made to them for that purpose, for he\r\nreally thought corn would grow there, which certainly would tend much to\r\nthe advantage of the Company, as well as to the security of persons\r\nresiding there. Their common provisions were fish and fowl, and they had\r\nno bread but what came from England; that all grain kept there very\r\nwell, except peas; that in a general way they had two years’ provisions\r\nbeforehand in their forts, especially of bread.”\r\n\r\nBeing asked if the Indians could not cultivate corn for one-third of the\r\nprice it costs in Europe, this witness said—“The Indians are in general\r\na slothful people and cultivate no corn.”\r\n\r\n                       SOIL GOOD AND CLIMATE MILD\r\n\r\nAnother of the witnesses examined before the committee, Mr. Matthew\r\nSergeant, stated that while in the Company’s service he had been twelve\r\nmiles up the country at York Factory, thirty miles up the river from\r\nAlbany Fort, and had travelled by land from Moose river to Albany Fort,\r\none hundred miles along the coast. The soil was good and produced good\r\nturnips, the climate for four months in the year being mild.\r\n\r\nThe record of the evidence continues:—“The good soil is not quite two\r\nfeet deep, when you come to a stratum of loam and sand. In some places\r\nthe frost is never out of the ground, but you may dig through it. The\r\nturnips he has eaten there are as good as ever he ate in England, but he\r\ndoes not know whether seed raised there would produce the same. It is\r\nthe general opinion at York Factory that the soil is proper for wheat,\r\nbarley, rye or oats. He has seen very good peas and beans grow there,\r\nbut he never saw any corn grow there, except some wild oats; and that\r\nhis mess-mate did sow some corn there, which, though it grew a good\r\nheight, never came to perfection; but, in the opinion of the witness,\r\noats would ripen at Albany, where he has seen a cherry-tree bearing\r\nblack cherries. He has seen the Indians bring down currants, which, they\r\nsaid, grew in their country. They also brought down sugar, which was\r\nvery black, and made from the tree of which their paddles are made; that\r\nthe Indians informed the witness that there are large lakes behind the\r\nfactory; that the witness had been in a lake ten miles long, without any\r\nfall going to it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Prairie Land on lower Nelson river.]\r\n\r\n“It begins to thaw at Albany about April 8 or 10. There is a good soil\r\nthere for six or eight inches, which may be gained within about a\r\nfortnight after the beginning of the thaw; that in two or three weeks\r\nmore, as the weather happens, it thaws to the depth of two feet,\r\ncommonly by the beginning of May. The frost sets in again about the\r\nbeginning of October, and when the witness was there, October 4, it came\r\nin very hard. The witness believes there is time enough to grow wheat,\r\nfor if summer grain were sown early in the southernmost parts, he thinks\r\nthere would be time for it to ripen and to gather it in, but the frosts\r\nbreak sooner up in the country and come in later. There are vast tracts\r\nof land fit for cultivation, and the witness has seen very good lettuce,\r\nspinach, dewberries, strawberries and black cherries. The Indians very\r\nrarely eat any bread, nor do they live long enough in one place to raise\r\ncorn, nor have they any yams or potatoes, their provisions being fish\r\nand flesh, which they preserve by drying it, not having the art of\r\nsalting. In case they were interested in the arts of tillage, he does\r\nnot know whether they would stay in a place long enough to raise corn,\r\nfor though they love bread dearly they would rather go hunting than\r\ncultivate land. The wild oats he mentioned before never came to seed,\r\nbeing little better than a species of grass. Grass grows there\r\nsufficient for the support of cattle, and they have made hay at Albany.\r\nIf the Company were to grow corn, they apprehend the French would come\r\nand take it as they did their sheep in the last war, but they might\r\nprotect their corn from the Indians. Witness does not think it to the\r\nbenefit of the Company to grow corn, because they must have a house\r\nbuilt at a distance from the factories, and men to watch it, to prevent\r\nthe home Indians from stealing it. They must also have men to cultivate\r\nit, which would be very expensive. The witness cannot determine whether\r\nit would not be more so than having their corn from Europe, and he\r\nthinks the Company would sow it, if it were for their advantage.”\r\n\r\nMr. John Hayter, another witness, said that he had been house carpenter\r\nto the Company six years at Moose river, three years at Churchill, and\r\nsix months at Albany, and knew that no other trade was carried on there\r\nbut that of furs. He had seen good barley grow at Moose river, and\r\nhelped the person who grew it to dig his ground and sow it. It produced\r\nabout the quantity of half a bushel, which he saw rubbed out. The ear\r\nwas large, and yielded as well, in the opinion of the witness, as the\r\nbarley sown on common ground in England. Some of the seed was sown the\r\nnext year, and it grew again but the witness did not see the produce of\r\nit. The person who grew this corn told him the reason why he\r\ndiscontinued sowing corn was that the Governor hindered him. Witness\r\nfurther said that he had made hay at Moose river.\r\n\r\nMr. Edward Thompson, who had been three years at Moose river in the\r\nHudson’s Bay Company’s service as surgeon, being required to give an\r\naccount of the commodities, soil and climate there, before the\r\ncommittee, said that the chief commodities were the furs of the beaver,\r\nthe marten, the fox and the bear. He testified that he had seen better\r\nbarley and oats grow at Moose river than ever he saw in the Orkneys, but\r\nthe quantity sown was but very small. The seed would bear sowing again,\r\nbut diminished in goodness. There was suitable enough ground for this\r\ncorn, but never any encouragement given for sowing it, but quite the\r\nreverse, the Governor absolutely forbidding it, for no other reason, as\r\nthe witness apprehended, but that if corn had been sown, a colony would\r\nsoon have been erected there, and he could not say whether that would be\r\nfor the advantage of the proprietors. The witness himself sowed about\r\nhalf a dozen corns of wheat, for a trial, in October, which lay in the\r\nground all winter covered with snow and came to perfection in August. It\r\nwas sown in a piece of good ground near the foot of a tree, which was in\r\nsome measure a fence to it. The witness thought that beans, peas, barley\r\nand oats would grow there. He never tried it anywhere but at Moose\r\nriver, but apprehended that corn would grow in the inland countries at a\r\nhundred miles distance, even as far north as Port Nelson, for he had\r\nfound the climate warmer the further one goes inland.\r\n\r\nEnoch Alsop, who had been armourer to the Hudson’s Bay Company at Moose\r\nriver, informed the investigating Committee of 1749 that he had sown\r\nbarley and oats there, the same seed three years successively, and that\r\nit grew very well. He sowed a handful or two of barley and oats at\r\nfirst, mixed with dust and ashes, which produced two or three quarts or\r\na gallon of barley, and he thinks in the third year he had above half a\r\nbushel. Governor Stanton then\r\n\r\n                      FORBADE HIM TO SOW ANY MORE\r\n\r\nbut gave no reason for such prohibition.\r\n\r\nRobert Griffin, another of the witnesses, stated that he had been\r\ninformed that the soil one hundred miles up the country would produce\r\ncorn. He had seen oats grow to perfection at Albany. He had also seen\r\npeas, beans, turnips, salading (_sic_) and cabbage, and some few\r\ncarrots. The beans were generally blighted, but the turnips, peas and\r\ncabbage, were “in great plenty and perfection.” They had fresh seed sent\r\nover every year. The land was then cultivated for about a mile round\r\nAlbany, being dug with spades upon the breaking of the frost, which\r\ngenerally happened from April 20 to 27.\r\n\r\nIn his evidence, Mr. Joseph Robson, perhaps the principal witness,\r\nexplained that there was grass in abundance a yard high in the most\r\nnorthern parts of Hudson bay region he had seen. He did not believe corn\r\nwould grow in the far north but grain would grow over large areas. He\r\nhad eaten peas and beans which had been grown at York Factory, in\r\nlatitude 57°, but he never knew any other corn tried there. The quantity\r\nof peas and beans he spoke of was as much as six or eight people could\r\neat, but there were a thousand acres of ground in latitude 57°, which,\r\nif cultivated, would produce the same, and there was a much larger tract\r\nto the southward. The peas and beans grew by common cultivation, without\r\nany force, but the produce was not so large as in England.\r\n\r\nBeing asked if it would not be a great advantage to the Company to grow\r\ncorn at York Factory or their other settlements, Mr. Robson said it\r\nwould doubtless be so, and it was reasonable to think they would do it,\r\nbut there were many things not done which would be of great advantage\r\nbesides that, and there must be some secret cause for it to which the\r\nwitness was a stranger. It had been demonstrated that the soil about\r\nHudson bay would bear roots, such as carrots, radishes and turnips. It\r\nalso produced coleworts, and all of these roots and greens grew in as\r\ngreat perfection as they do in England; yet he did not think that there\r\nwere two acres cultivated at both the factories where he had resided.\r\n\r\nBeing asked how long the frost was out of the ground at York Factory,\r\nMr. Robson said it was hardly ever quite out of it, for he had dug three\r\nfeet and a half deep, and then found a shell of ice under which the\r\nground was all soft. The hole he dug was in low ground, about thirteen\r\nfeet from high water mark. He never had an opportunity to dig up in the\r\ncountry, but the surface of the ground was free from the latter end of\r\nMay to the latter end of August, and in the summer they had\r\n\r\n                 EIGHTEEN HOURS SUNLIGHT AT CHURCHILL.\r\n\r\nBy the accounts of the people coming down, the frost breaks some months\r\nsooner up in the country.\r\n\r\nMr. Robson said he had seen oxen and horses belonging to the Company at\r\nFort Prince of Wales (Churchill) which were brought from England and fed\r\nwith hay and corn, the hay being got there and made into stacks.\r\n\r\nRobson, who first went to Hudson bay in 1733, and finally left there in\r\n1747, serving for some time as a mason, and later as “mason and\r\nsurveyor,” in the construction of Fort Prince of Wales at Churchill,\r\npublished his book “An Account of Six Years’ Residence in Hudson’s Bay”\r\nin 1752. In this volume he mentions going out in the “Mary” frigate, and\r\nsays, in writing of Churchill:—“We had brought over in the ship a bull,\r\nfour heifers, ten oxen and a horse. There was an Orkney bull there\r\nbefore. Some of the heifers afterwards calved, and I think with care\r\nthey would have increased and done well, though this place is in 59°,\r\nand the most northerly settlement in the bay.”\r\n\r\nOn page forty-two of his book, Mr. Robson states:—“It is not to be\r\nimagined that the most northerly settlements in the bay should have as\r\ngood a climate as the southerly settlement, there being so great a\r\ndifference of latitude, as from 59° to 51° 30′. I was no farther up\r\nChurchill river than eight or nine miles but can say that the soil is\r\nvery good, and that there are gooseberries and black and red currants\r\ngrowing near the sea upon points that appear almost barren. Those I have\r\nseen grow so low that the grass covers them. The marshes and low grounds\r\nare full of good grass, and there is a patch of ground near the fort on\r\nEskimo point (near Churchill) which, though exposed to the north and\r\nnortheast winds, produces good radishes, coleworts, turnips, small\r\ncarrots, and lettuces, and other salading; blackberries also grow upon\r\nthe heath. Upon clearing away the snow in the spring, we generally found\r\nthe under part of it congested to ice, three or four inches thick, lying\r\nhollow from the ground. Whether this was caused by the snow melting and\r\nthawing downwards, and then congesting from the coldness of the earth,\r\nand moistening the snow which was afterwards congested again, I am not\r\nable to determine. I am inclined to believe the latter, because the top\r\nof the snow was formed into a hard icy crust, and within was heavy,\r\nthough soft. However, beneath this arch of ice we found green vegetables\r\ngrowing up an inch or two above the ground. Cattle here would live and\r\ndo well, if the same care were taken of them as is generally taken in\r\nEngland. The horses I found among them had been kept several years, and\r\nwere constantly employed in drawing stones and other materials for the\r\nuse of the fort. And if they can subsist and be fit for service at\r\nChurchill river in 59° they would surely subsist and increase also at\r\nthe bottom of the bay in 51° 30′, and in all the more southerly\r\nsettlements.\r\n\r\n“The soil at York Factory, which is in 75° 10′, is much better than at\r\nChurchill river. Most kinds of garden stuff\r\n\r\n                        GROW HERE TO PERFECTION,\r\n\r\nespecially peas and beans. I have seen a small pea growing without any\r\nculture, and am of the opinion that barley would flourish here, and\r\nconsequently in much greater perfection at Moose and Albany rivers,\r\nwhich are 51° 30′ and 52°. Gooseberries and red and black currants are\r\nfound in the woods, growing upon such bushes as in England. Up the river\r\nare very good patches of grounds, and bottoms under banks, so defended\r\nfrom the north and northwest winds that there is a fine thaw below when\r\nthe top is freezing; here whole families might secure a comfortable\r\nsubsistence, if they were as industrious as they are in their own\r\ncountry. Upon Hayes river, fifteen miles from the factory, is such a\r\nbank as I have just mentioned, near which I pitched my tent. After\r\npaling in some ground for a covey-warren, and for oxen, sheep, goats,\r\netc., I should expect by no more labor than would be proper for my\r\nhealth to procure a desirable livelihood, not at all doubting of my\r\nbeing able to raise peas and beans, barley, and probably other kinds of\r\ngrain.”\r\n\r\nOn page sixty-three, Mr. Robson expresses the opinion “that the lands\r\nare capable of tillage, affording a good pasture for horses and cattle\r\nin the summer, and good hay for their subsistence in the winter. At\r\nChurchill, the most northerly factory, horses and cows have been kept in\r\nwinter, though greatly exposed to the frost and cold. All sorts of\r\ngarden stuff flourish at the factory, and where barley and oats have\r\nbeen sown, they come to perfection. At Moose Factory at the bottom of\r\nthe bay, sown wheat has stood the winter frosts, and grown very well the\r\nfollowing summer, though the cold is greater and continues longer than\r\nwithin land; black cherries planted here have also grown and borne\r\nfruit, as would other trees if propagated.”\r\n\r\nReverting to the subject of climate, Mr. Robson states:—“I perceived\r\nthat the garden ground at York Factory and Churchill river thawed much\r\nsooner and deeper in the space of one month than the waste that lies\r\ncontiguous to it, and the same is to be observed in England. By the heat\r\ntherefore which the earth here would acquire from a general and careful\r\ncultivation, the frost might be so soon overcome that the people might\r\nexpect regular returns of seed-time and harvest.”\r\n\r\n                     AN EXCELLENT FARMING COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nEd. Umfreville, in his volume “Eleven Years in the Service of the\r\nHudson’s Bay Company and Four Years in the Canada Fur Trade”, published\r\nin 1790, speaking of latitude 55°, says:—“The Hudson’s Bay Company\r\nservants have tried Indian corn and barley by way of experiment which\r\ncame to perfection. Potatoes, carrots, radishes, onions, etc., have been\r\nreared and found as good as those in Canada (Quebec). The natives\r\ncollect vast quantities of wild cherries and bring them to the fort.\r\nRaspberries, strawberries, currants, cranberries, and an infinity of\r\nother kinds of which I do not know the names, are to be found\r\neverywhere. The grass grows to a great height which fattens our horses\r\nin a short time.\r\n\r\n“The late Chief Factor Archibald, in his journal of Sir George Simpson’s\r\ntrip from York Factory to the Pacific in 1828, speaks of having had, on\r\nJuly 12, two days after leaving York, “a peep at the Rock, an old\r\nestablishment with its gardens.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. John Semmens, who spent many years as a missionary in the north\r\ncountry, went to live on the banks of Burntwood river, at Nelson House,\r\nin the year 1874. He remained there two years, and for a number of years\r\nthereafter paid occasional visits to the locality and made journeys\r\nthrough the adjacent country. He writes:—“The most of my tripping was\r\nbetween Norway House and Nelson House, though I have been as far north\r\nas Indian lake, as far west as Nelson lake, and as far east as Split\r\nlake. The information I have to offer, therefore, concerns the lower\r\nreaches of the Burntwood after its junction with Rat river at Nelson\r\nHouse. Much of the country specified is hilly, with frequent outcropping\r\nof granite rock, and some large tracts of muskeg or swamp land, but\r\nthere are found large areas of open country, and valleys of tributary\r\nrivers, where the soil is rich and deep and where grazing and stock\r\nraising could be very successfully carried on. The sheltering forests,\r\nand the abundant water courses, the numerous beaver dams, and the rich\r\nnative grasses would indeed make this locality ideal to sheep raisers\r\nand general ranchmen. The absence of anything like a market has hitherto\r\nkept this country from being reported of, but if a railway becomes an\r\nactual fact, Manitoba will add very much to her available resources,\r\nwhen extension comes, and settlers will find that in soil, in wood, in\r\ngrasses, and in waters, this unknown land will afford comfortable homes\r\nfor thousands. It will be seen by the map that about one hundred miles\r\ndown the Nelson all the branches of that noble river unite in one. From\r\nthat point we are accustomed to strike across country to Landing lake,\r\nWintering lake, Pipestone lake and thence into Burntwood river. This\r\nshort cut has along its course many thousands of acres, such as I have\r\ndescribed, and for fishermen as well as ranchers must some day be a\r\nparadise.\r\n\r\n“The cold at Nelson House is no more intense than that of a winter in\r\nnorthern Manitoba as at present constituted, but the frost sets in\r\nrather sooner, and tarries rather longer than it does at the north end\r\nof Lake Winnipeg. Roots and vegetables planted about May 24 do well and\r\nare gathered about September 15. The presence of so much water so\r\nregulates the temperature that there are few frosts either early or late\r\nto make growth uncertain, yet, in my experience, wheat is not a sure\r\ncrop. All depends on the season. Oats and barley will do well any\r\ntime.”—(J. A. J. McKenna’s report on the Hudson Bay Route).\r\n\r\n                           SPLIT LAKE REGION.\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Doctor John McDougall, one of the pioneer missionaries of\r\nthe west, has thus expressed himself regarding the region to the south\r\nof Split lake:—“The summer begins early, and the growth and vegetation\r\nare almost of a tropical character. This is attributable to the longer\r\nhours of sunshine that prevail, and to the proximity of streams of\r\nliving waters everywhere in the district, each of which is conducive to\r\nplant nourishment. There is considerable rock throughout the section\r\nwhich indicates in the near future a season of development for the\r\nmineral prospector but there are also countless acres of good land which\r\ncan be easily made to yield fruitful returns to the farmer, as has been\r\nthe case southward in Manitoba and westward in Saskatchewan and Alberta.\r\nThe soil is of clay sub-strata with sandy loam on the surface, and,\r\nalthough wooded to a considerable extent, is a far more enticing\r\nagricultural proposition than that which faced the early settlers on the\r\nbush farms of Ontario and other eastern provinces fifty years ago, and,\r\nwith the advent of railways, a better market than the eastern settler\r\nhad would be always available. The district in which are situated Norway\r\nHouse, Cross lake, Oxford House, Island lake, Nelson House and Split\r\nlake, covers a wide area, and at each of these places garden vegetables\r\nand grain for personal requirements have been successfully grown for a\r\nterm of years. Summer frosts are practically unknown and the germination\r\nof vegetation, owing to the long hours of sunshine, is exceedingly\r\nrapid.” (McKenna Report.)\r\n\r\nDoctor Robert Bell, in the report of his exploratory trip from Lake\r\nWinnipeg to Hudson bay in 1878 (See p. 17), states:—“Along the direct\r\noverland route from Churchill to York Factory the timber is reported to\r\nbe generally small, and large prairie-like openings are said to occur,\r\nin which the ground is dry and covered with grass or other herbage. I\r\nsaw very good potatoes and turnips growing in the gardens at Churchill.\r\nPrevious to the advent of Mr. and Mrs. Spencer, the cultivation of\r\npotatoes had not been attempted, and the possibility of raising them at\r\nChurchill when suggested by Mrs. Spencer was ridiculed by the oldest\r\ninhabitants. However, in spite of predictions of certain failure, the\r\nground was prepared, seed planted, and a good crop was harvested. The\r\nexperiment has been repeated successfully for seven consecutive years,\r\nso that the question of the practicability of cultivating potatoes on\r\nthe shores of Hudson bay in this latitude has been pretty well solved.\r\n\r\n“Hay can be cut in abundance in the neighborhood of Churchill, and\r\ncattle thrive well, yet the same ignorance or obstinacy, as the above\r\nreferred to, formerly prevented any attempt being made to breed stock on\r\nthe spot, so that every fresh animal required had to be brought from\r\nsome other place. Now, the small herd which is kept at the place is\r\nrecruited by raising the animals calved at the fort itself. The open\r\ngrassy land near the sea is practically of unlimited extent. Much of it\r\nis dry and undulating, affording abundance of pasture for the cattle.\r\nThe butter made by Mrs. Spencer could hardly be excelled for quality and\r\nfineness in any country.”\r\n\r\n                        LAKE ST. JOSEPH SECTION.\r\n\r\nIn the report (Part G., Geol. Sur. Report, 1886) of his exploratory trip\r\nin 1886 (See p. 18), Doctor Robert Bell, speaking of the country in Lake\r\nSt. Joseph section, in the extreme southern side of the region under\r\nreview, writes:—“The climate, in the immediate vicinity of the lake at\r\nall events, appears to be sufficiently good to admit of the growth of a\r\nvariety of crops. At Osnaburgh House, near the east end, where the soil\r\nis of a sandy nature, the principal crop cultivated at present is\r\npotatoes, but early Indian corn, peas, beans, and a variety of roots and\r\nother vegetables, to say nothing of a profusion of flowers, were in a\r\nflourishing condition at the end of July. In former years, when cattle\r\nwere kept at the post, barley was said to have been a regular crop. Hay\r\ngrows very luxuriantly. I was creditably informed that pumpkins and\r\nmuskmelons had frequently ripened at this establishment.”\r\n\r\nDoctor Bell, before the Senate committee of 1887, testified:—“Potatoes\r\nand all such vegetables would grow in Hudson bay district, but the\r\nimmediate influence of the sea is unfavourable for gardens. Gardens\r\nclose to the sea do not flourish as well as gardens inland. The frequent\r\nchange from heat to cold and the fogs from the sea prejudicially affect\r\nthem, and cause a sort of blight on vegetation close to the sea shore.\r\nBut a few miles inland vegetation is more rank, and you can grow\r\npotatoes and the ordinary root crops. There are plenty of grasses there\r\nto keep cattle and sheep. There are many kinds of grasses there, also\r\nsedges, wild peas or vetches and lentils. They would make splendid feed\r\nfor cattle.”\r\n\r\nMr. Fawcett (Annual Report, Dep. Interior, 1885, pt. II, p. 37),\r\nspeaking of his descent of the Wenassago to Lac Seul, says:—“In a few\r\nplaces I noticed soil of vegetable mould and clay loam, which would be\r\nwell suited for the growth of grain and vegetables should the climatic\r\nconditions be favourable. I also observed here that the best soil\r\ngenerally produced a growth of poplar, and wherever it appeared large\r\nand thrifty, good soil might be looked for, comparatively free from\r\nrock. On the rocky ridges, as usual, scrubby pine was the prevailing\r\ntimber, while the flats and muskegs were invariably covered with spruce\r\nand tamarack. The good land noticed seemed to be in belts three or four\r\nmiles wide and extending north and south for a considerable distance, as\r\nmight be expected from the geological formation, the depressions and\r\nelevations succeeding each other in very regular order and much in the\r\nsame direction.”\r\n\r\nOn Big Black river, which flows into the east side of Lake Winnipeg, Mr.\r\nA. S. Cochrane, of the Geological Survey, who surveyed that stream in\r\n1882, reports the soil as “excellent, being a light-gray friable\r\nclay. . . . . The land up to Pelican portage is first class, but above\r\nthis there is a low and swampy country, which extends to\r\n‘Rapids-close-together’. A border of good land, on which some fair-sized\r\ntimber grows, runs along both sides of the river.”\r\n\r\n                    FAVOURABLE LAKE AND SEVERN LAKE.\r\n\r\nMr. Low, in the account of his trip in 1886, reports that along the\r\nshores of Favourable lake (which is from two to five miles in width)\r\n“there are considerable areas of good land, the best being on the\r\npeninsula and along the southern part of the lake, where the underlying\r\nrocks are hornblende and chloritic schists; the northern part is more\r\nbarren, the soil resting upon gneiss. The soil is a fine, rich sandy\r\nloam, quite suitable for growing good crops, and summer frosts seem to\r\nbe the only drawback to successful agriculture. These are said to not\r\noccur at Trout lake, though situated further to the northeastward. At\r\nthe end of the peninsula the foundations of several old houses were\r\ndiscovered, out of which trees twelve inches in diameter were growing.\r\nThese ruins evidently mark the site of some old Hudson’s Bay Company or\r\nmore probably North West Company trading post. . . . .\r\n\r\n“There is much good land about Sandy lake. Indeed the greater part of\r\nthe land around these lakes would make good farms.”\r\n\r\nA short distance above Severn lake, according to Mr. Low, there is a\r\nconsiderable area of country “almost flat, with good timber and soil.”\r\n\r\nMr. Low describes Trout lake (east of Severn lake) as being forty miles\r\nlong by twenty miles wide. He states in his report that Mr. Tait, the\r\nofficer in charge of the Hudson’s Bay Company’s post at that point,\r\n“says that good crops of peas, potatoes and other roots are raised here\r\nyearly, and are very rarely injured by summer frosts. This being the\r\ncase, the country to the westward, between Severn and Sandy lakes, which\r\nis more favourably situated, having all the appearance of a better\r\nclimate and a richer soil, must undoubtedly be well suited for\r\nagriculture, and will at some future time prove valuable land for\r\nsettlement.”\r\n\r\nMr. Low reports the soil around Fort Severn as a heavy clay and very\r\nswampy. Nothing but a few small turnips are with difficulty grown there.\r\nOn August 8, strawberries, then beginning to ripen, were picked by Mr.\r\nLow on clearings around the post.\r\n\r\nMr. Low was examined at length before the Senate committee of 1907 (See\r\np. 27), and stated in his evidence that the country between Norway House\r\nand Hudson bay is not very elevated. The highest points in it are\r\nprobably somewhere in the neighbourhood of one thousand feet above sea\r\nlevel. For about half the distance to Hudson bay it is practically a\r\nrolling plain, and the rocks are ancient rocks of the Laurentian and\r\nHuronian ages. Beyond that there was an ancient deposit of limestone and\r\nsandstone, extending in a wide line around the northern part about half\r\nway across. These are large limestones, and they are lying almost flat.\r\nThe country for about half way down from Norway House to Churchill\r\nslopes very gently towards the bay, so that the grade is not more than\r\neight or ten feet to the mile, if it is that. The northeastern part is\r\npractically a plain.\r\n\r\nThere are considerable areas of low swampy lands. The surface going down\r\ninto Hudson bay after reaching the Wolstenholme country is fairly\r\nswampy. The rivers have thrown up banks, and it is only at an occasional\r\nplace that a break through those banks occurred to let out the drainage.\r\nIn many places the river banks are from five to ten feet higher than the\r\nsurrounding country, and in consequence the land beyond is drowned more\r\nor less, very often extending back for a distance as far as one can walk\r\nin a day.\r\n\r\nMr. Low considered that probably half the country due east from Norway\r\nHouse, say for one hundred miles, would be\r\n\r\n                          FIT FOR AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\nHe would rank the agricultural possibilities there as fair.\r\n\r\nOf course there are very few settlements in there now, and the only one\r\nMr. Low visited was a Hudson’s Bay post at Trout lake, and they were\r\ngrowing peas and garden truck of all kinds, also potatoes and fairly\r\ndecent looking crops. They were not bothered very badly with summer\r\nfrosts, as Mr. Low could see from the crop of green peas. The climate\r\nseemed quite favourable for hardy crops. The soil areas that are fit for\r\nagriculture are fairly large; the rocky hills crop out only at\r\nintervals, and there is quite a large area there that Mr. Low thought\r\nwould be fit for future settlement.\r\n\r\nThe low flat plain, southeast of Nelson river, appeared to be largely\r\ncovered with muskeg and small spruce. He would suppose that there was\r\nmore muskeg and spruce land than hay areas. The subsoil is clay largely.\r\nDown in the lower country near the bay there is a certain amount of sand\r\non top. There was a fair amount of vegetable growth. Mr. Low remarked\r\nthat he would not consider this low-lying area a good agricultural\r\ncountry at present, but with some drainage he thought a great deal of\r\nthat country around James and Hudson bays is going to make a good\r\nagricultural country.\r\n\r\nWith regard to that territory north of Lake Winnipeg and east of Norway\r\nHouse and in the country southeast thereof, Mr. Low thought it would be\r\na somewhat rocky country, but probably not more than one-third would be\r\nof that nature. Most of the land not rocky would be timber land. This\r\nwould run up to about the eighteenth degree or probably more.\r\n\r\nMr. Low, speaking as to the climate of the region west of Hudson bay,\r\nexplained that in the southern part, south of the Nelson, it is fairly\r\ngood, he thought, for settlement. The summer frosts are rare, and he\r\nthought with the opening up of the country it would probably improve. He\r\nconsidered that settlers in there would not have any more difficulty in\r\nsummer than they would in the settled part of the northwest. The summer\r\nis probably equal to that of Saskatchewan. The length of the summer days\r\nis an advantage. They get more sunlight during the summer than do the\r\npeople of older Ontario or other points farther south, and that is a\r\ndistinct help to vegetation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portaging canoe at Long Spruce rapids, Nelson river.]\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1896, Mr. J. B. Tyrrell explored the country north of\r\nthe mouth of Saskatchewan river. As a result of the exploration he\r\nstates in his report:—“From Nelson river westward to longitude 100°\r\n30′, and from the north end of Lake Winnipeg northward to beyond\r\nlatitude 56°, the country is generally covered with a coating of\r\nstratified clay, varying in thickness from a few feet up to fifty,\r\nsixty, or even one hundred feet. This clay is of much the same character\r\nas that of Red river valley, having been, like it, deposited in the bed\r\nof the old post-glacial lake that once occupied the basin of Lake\r\nWinnipeg. The rivers have, as a rule, cut down through this clay to the\r\nunderlying rock, but away from the water-stretches rock exposures are\r\nnot of any frequent occurrence. The\r\n\r\n                       SOIL IS RICH AND FERTILE,\r\n\r\nand the country will doubtless produce in abundance all the hardier\r\nroots and cereals grown in the province of Manitoba; and cattle, sheep,\r\nand horses could be successfully raised. If the country were made\r\naccessible by a railway passing through it to Hudson bay, it would\r\ncertainly support a considerable agricultural population.”\r\n\r\nAt page seven of his report (Part F. Geol. Sur. Rep., 1900, Vol. XII)\r\nMr. Tyrrell states:—“Much of the land is well adapted for agriculture.\r\nAt Norway House some fine barley had been sown and ripened in the\r\ngarden, and all the ordinary vegetables grown in Manitoba have been\r\nraised for many years past. At Cross lake many of the Indians had good\r\nlarge gardens of potatoes and other vegetables, and McLeod and Mclvor,\r\ntwo fur traders, had excellent gardens in which were growing potatoes,\r\nturnips, carrots, parsnips, radishes, cabbages, cauliflowers, onions,\r\nlettuce, beans, peas, etc. At Nelson House in the extreme northern part\r\nof the district explored, many of the Indians regularly grow potatoes,\r\nand both the fur traders and the missionaries cultivate small patches of\r\nground on which they raise abundant crops of all the vegetables\r\nmentioned as growing at Cross lake. It is probable that the hardier\r\nvarieties of grain would also ripen here, but at present there is no\r\nobject in growing grain of any kind for it could not be readily\r\nutilized.”\r\n\r\nIn a foot note, Mr. Tyrrell states “Wheat ripens well at Norway House\r\nand Cross lake on the Nelson.”\r\n\r\nOn page eight of his report Mr. Tyrrell says:—“During the summer of\r\n1896 no frost occurred until August 29. At Nelson House we were informed\r\nthat, during the preceding seven years at least, no frost that would\r\ninjure garden produce had occurred at an earlier date.”\r\n\r\nAt page thirty-four of his report Mr. Tyrrell states:—“Wuskwatim lake\r\nis a very pretty sheet of slightly murky water, six or seven miles long\r\nand three miles wide, surrounded by sloping clay-covered hills wooded\r\nwith white spruce and poplar. Its surface is varied by a few islands\r\ncomposed of clay overlying a floor of gneiss. The two falls above\r\nmentioned, at and near its outlet, would furnish a large amount of\r\n\r\n                        POWER FOR DRIVING MILLS\r\n\r\nor machinery of any kind, while a supply of timber for building and fuel\r\ncould be obtained from the surrounding country, and the soil would grow\r\nany of the ordinary roots or more hardy cereals, so that it is not\r\nimprobable that before long when this fertile country is made accessible\r\nby the advent of a railroad from the south, one of the most prosperous\r\ntowns in the district may grow up on the shore of this now secluded\r\nlake.\r\n\r\n“Footprint lake, on the northern shore of which the Hudson’s Bay Company\r\nhave had a trading post for a number of years, and the Methodists have a\r\nsmall church and mission house, has somewhat the shape of a rude cross,\r\nseven miles long from east to west, and six miles from north to south.\r\nThe latitude of the trading post was found to be 55° 48′ 26′′ north. The\r\nlake is surrounded by banks of light grey friable clay from thirty to\r\nforty feet high, through which rise rounded hills of gneiss up to two\r\nhundred feet or more in height. The clay extends over the lower portions\r\nof these hills, but some of the higher summits appear to rise above it,\r\npossibly having risen above the surface of Lake Agassiz where the\r\nsurrounding clay was deposited on its floor. When the lake was visited\r\nin August last both the trader and the missionary had excellent gardens\r\nin which they were successfully growing potatoes, cabbages,\r\ncauliflowers, onions, radishes, lettuce, peas, beans, turnips, carrots\r\nand other vegetables, and many of the Indians had patches of potatoes\r\nsufficiently large to assist materially in the support of their families\r\nthroughout the winter.\r\n\r\n“I enquired from the Indians who were living around the lake, how far\r\nthe fertile clay-covered country extended towards the north, and they\r\ntold me that it extended as far as Indian lake on Churchill river, north\r\nof which the surface is either of sand or rock.”\r\n\r\nMr. Tyrrell reports that many of the smaller fruits grow on the\r\nclay-covered country explored in great profusion. Among those that he\r\nreports as especially abundant were raspberries, gooseberries, red and\r\nblack currants, strawberries, blueberries and headberries (_Rubus\r\nChameomorus_).\r\n\r\nStrawberries were growing “in great profusion” in the tract about\r\nMuhigan rapids on Muhigan river.\r\n\r\nThe country above Wuskwatim lake, according to Mr. Tyrrell, “seems to be\r\na great clay plain, cut through by the sloping trough of the river, and\r\ntrenched by wide lateral gulleys. The surface is generally covered with\r\nsmall poplar, with some spruce in the valleys, and there are no signs of\r\nrocky hills, or of rock, except here and there at the water’s edge.”\r\n\r\nMr. Tyrrell reports that McLaughlin river, throughout its whole course\r\nfrom the long narrow lake to its mouth, flows through a level,\r\nclay-covered country, the rock merely rising here and there in knolls\r\nand ridges above the general level.\r\n\r\nMr. Tyrrell, reporting (Summary Rep. Geol. Survey, 1890-91) on his\r\nsurvey of the district about Lakes Winnipeg and Winnipegosis, mentions a\r\ncliff at Limestone bay, in the extreme northwest of Lake Winnipeg,\r\nrising in some places to a height of forty feet, composed at the bottom\r\nof a stiff, blue alluvial clay, and at the top of a mossy peat, and\r\nfurther on in the report proceeds to say:—“A deposit of clay similar to\r\nthat on Mossy point extends all along the east shore of Lake Winnipeg,\r\nand the waves washing against the soft cliffs become charged with the\r\nmud from which the lake derives its name. This clay is also of great\r\neconomic interest, for instead of the east shore of the lake being an\r\nuninhabitable rocky wilderness, as is generally supposed, it is largely\r\ncovered with\r\n\r\n                       A RICH BLUE ALLUVIAL SOIL,\r\n\r\nand the area of rock surface is relatively small. Much of this land is\r\ncovered with forests of poplar and spruce, while on account of the\r\nretentive, impervious nature of the clay soil much of it is also boggy\r\nand wet, but when it is cleared and drained it will form rich\r\nagricultural land. At Badthroat river, Mr. Wood, the local Inspector of\r\nFisheries, had cleared a beautiful farm out of the midst of the poplar\r\nforest, and he informs me that he grows successfully all the crops\r\nordinarily raised in Ontario. Mr. McKay, the Indian Agent at Berens\r\nriver, has also a clearing situated on the south side of the river in\r\nthe midst of what was a dense forest of small spruce. He has under\r\ncultivation a nice garden, and this year the potatoes were not cut down\r\nby frost till the middle of September.”\r\n\r\nDuring his examination before the Senate committee of 1907, Mr. Tyrrell\r\ndescribed the whole stretch of country extending from Lake Winnipeg and\r\nSplit lake on the east to Churchill and Athabaska on the west[14] as a\r\n“country essentially suited for agricultural purposes.” He could not say\r\nwhat there was beyond the limits mentioned as he had not been there.\r\nThis was a forest belt. The eastern side of this tract would be Nelson\r\nriver. Not having been east of that river with the exception of twenty\r\nor thirty miles, he could not speak of the country beyond. Mr. Tyrrell\r\ndeclared:—“That belt of forest is for the most part excellent\r\nagricultural land.” As far as the observations of Mr. Tyrrell went, he\r\nbelieved that that country, while a little harder to settle up, and not\r\nso attractive to settlers who are going in and looking for farms ready\r\nmade and cleared for them and ready to put the wheat in, would be as\r\nfine an agricultural tract of land as there is in the Northwest.\r\nEverywhere in travelling through it, the evidence of rich vegetation was\r\nabundant, and everywhere where gardens or any kind of agriculture or\r\nhorticulture had been attempted in this forest belt, it had been\r\neminently successful. It is a forest country, a spruce covered country,\r\nand lies southwest of Hudson bay, west of Nelson river, north of\r\nSaskatchewan river, and extends to Mackenzie and Athabaska rivers. It\r\nwould be about two hundred miles wide from north to south. Witness did\r\nnot remember the length of it. It is land similar to that of Ontario,\r\nand will grow practically everything that will grow in that province,\r\nexcept possibly down in the southern peninsula. The summer is warm. The\r\nwinter does not count, because things do not grow in winter. There is a\r\ngood rainfall. A small part of the district is park country, half\r\nwooded. It is a continuation northward of the Saskatchewan country.\r\n\r\nMr. Tyrrell said he had seen growing in that country all the garden\r\nproducts that they grow in Ontario—potatoes, carrots, turnips, cabbage,\r\ncauliflowers and all the ordinary garden produce. He saw excellent\r\npotatoes in the district around Nelson House. He could not say what time\r\nthey were planted, because he was not there. The Indians constantly,\r\nwhen hunting, plant little patches of potatoes here and there in the\r\nspring and leave them all summer and dig them up when they go back to\r\ntheir hunting grounds in the fall, and use them for their winter supply.\r\nThe witness had gone out and dug a pail of beautiful potatoes on several\r\noccasions out of these little Indian patches buried in the woods. They\r\nhad never been hoed or cultivated in any way. They were not looked after\r\nfrom the time they were planted in the spring until they were dug in the\r\nfall. The potatoes seem to be able to grow sufficiently to keep down the\r\nweeds. As a protection against wild animals these potato patches are\r\nusually planted on islands. Witness had not actually seen wheat, barley\r\nnor oats grown in that country. He has fairly good evidence that they\r\nare grown there, but as far as he remembered he had not seen any\r\nhimself. He had been told and believed that they grow there. There is no\r\ndoubt whatever that the country described will support quite a large\r\npopulation. North of Lake Winnipeg there is another magnificent area of\r\nfrom five to ten thousand square miles of as fine country as there is in\r\nManitoba or anywhere else. When Mr. Tyrrell came out of that district in\r\n1896, after spending a summer there, and said there was\r\n\r\n           A RICH AGRICULTURAL COUNTRY NORTH OF LAKE WINNIPEG\r\n\r\nthe Hudson’s Bay Company’s men and the people in the southern country\r\npooh-poohed the idea. They said they had been up at the head of the lake\r\nand knew there was not a foot of good land there. But Mr. Tyrrell\r\nemphatically declared that there is a magnificent stretch of country\r\nthere, which extends westward along the Churchill. These lands north of\r\nLake Winnipeg are clay lands, an extension of the same basin as the\r\nManitoba clays.\r\n\r\nMr. J. B. Tyrrell, in his evidence, pointed out that “the effect of the\r\nlarge body of water in Hudson bay and James bay on the temperature,\r\nsummer and winter, of the surrounding country, was the equalizing of it\r\nvery much, making the summers colder and the winters milder. There is a\r\nfoggy climate around the bay. It is without much sunlight, so that it\r\nhas not a chance to dry. The mean temperature of the summer within one\r\nhundred miles of the bay will not be so hot as it is back of that. The\r\nthermometer does not fall very low in winter at Churchill. At the same\r\ntime any person will find it terribly cold on that coast, although the\r\nthermometer does not fall very low. There are a great many different\r\nmatters in connection with temperature and climate that have to be taken\r\ninto consideration. There is the amount of moisture in the air; whether\r\nthe barometer is standing low or high; there are a great many of those\r\nthings that have to be taken into consideration in any question of frost\r\nor of climate that arises. You may have frost with a north wind, while\r\nif that north wind were blowing up over a wooded country, where all the\r\nleaves were giving out their vapour from the ground into the air, you\r\nwould not have a sign of frost.”\r\n\r\nAs to the climate of the great belt of arable land, that he had\r\ndescribed to the Senate committee of 1907, Mr. Tyrrell said that at\r\nNelson House the snow leaves the ground in May. There is little or no\r\nsummer frost in that wooded country. He understood gardening commences\r\nthe end of May, and the frost does not appear in the fall until about\r\nSeptember 20. He had never known the potato crop to be lost through\r\nsummer frost.\r\n\r\nAsked as to the isothermal line, Mr. Tyrrell remarked that the\r\nisothermal is a line connecting points that have the same mean\r\ntemperature for the year round. It has nothing whatever to do with\r\nvegetation. Things do not grow in the winter time. People have got to\r\nput the winter temperature absolutely out of the question. The summer\r\ntemperature is the only temperature that counts for growth in the\r\nnorthern country where there is frost. In dealing with that, you have to\r\ntake into consideration as between two places in different latitudes,\r\nthe length of the day and the amount of sunlight, in order to get at the\r\nsummer temperatures. Of course the sunlight has a great effect on the\r\ngrowth, and where the days have eighteen hours’ sun a plant will grow\r\nfaster than where the day has only fourteen hours.\r\n\r\nMr. Tyrrell submitted to the committee a memorandum from Mr. R. F.\r\nStupart, Superintendent of the Dominion Meteorological Service,\r\ncomparing the temperature conditions of the district between Lake\r\nWinnipeg and Split lake in the several months, May to September, with\r\nEuropean countries, as follows:—\r\n\r\n        May—50°-40°, with north of Scotland and southern Norway.\r\n        June—56°-54°, with Scotland.\r\n        July—63°, with south of England.\r\n        August—57·5°-55°, with Scotland.\r\n        September—50°-45°, with northern Norway and Sweden.\r\n\r\nMr. D. B. Dowling, reporting (Part F. Annual Rep. Geol. Sur. Vol. VII)\r\non his 1893 explorations (See p. 19) states:—“The agricultural\r\npossibilities of the valley of upper Berens river seem to be limited,\r\nand the areas suitable for cultivation are only to be found in isolated\r\npatches. These are principally in the neighbourhood of the larger lakes.\r\nThe Indian reserves have been located with this end in view as they seem\r\nto cover about the best land seen. The soil is a light grey clay with a\r\nlittle vegetable mould, and the gardens made by the Indians produce\r\npotatoes of fair quality, the only vegetable grown. In the southern part\r\nof the district, better land is found and in greater extent than in\r\nBerens river valley. On Lac Seul, at the mission and trading post, there\r\nare\r\n\r\n                       SEVERAL VERY GOOD GARDENS\r\n\r\nin a flourishing condition, with all the ordinary vegetables growing\r\nvery satisfactorily. The Indians appear to care little for any gardening\r\nexcept a very primitive attempt at raising potatoes. Land suitable for\r\ngardening was seen at Mattawa, and indeed the best and largest extent\r\nfor this purpose is to be found between Lac Seul and Shallow lake.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dowling, writing of the northern branch of Berens river,\r\nstates:—“The land reserved for the Indians on the upper part of this\r\nbranch of Berens river, is a small tract situated on the north side of a\r\nlong arm or narrows, running to the eastward, from a lake to which the\r\nname Pekangikum is given. The river enters at the eastern end of this\r\narea, coming from Sturgeon lake by a short stretch of river half a mile\r\nin length, in which there are two rapids. The Indian reserve appears\r\nfairly well timbered—principally with Banksian pine of slender growth\r\nand some spruce. The Indians have been able, in building their houses,\r\nto obtain timber of suitable size for the walls and rafters, and spruce\r\nof a diameter of fourteen inches is fairly plentiful. The shores of the\r\nlake are rocky, but strips of country inland appear, on which there is\r\nprobably a fair quality of soil, though the surface is generally sandy.\r\nOn one of the islands in the larger part of the lake, soil of good\r\nquality (clay) was seen, on which the Indians were growing potatoes. No\r\ndoubt there is better land for this purpose on the reserve they have\r\nselected, but as they make their summer camp on a small island near the\r\ndeeper part of the lake for the purpose of fishing—by which they mainly\r\nsubsist—they naturally utilize the nearest land for their summer\r\ngardens.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dowling, writing in his report of the country north of Lake Winnipeg\r\nand south of Burntwood river, says:—“As the area is situated so far\r\nnorth of the boundary of Manitoba, it might be presumed that much of it\r\nis unfitted for settlement, but it is discovered that over a large part\r\nthere is good soil, and\r\n\r\n                    THE EVIDENCE OF SEVERAL GARDENS\r\n\r\nat various posts shows that for all the ordinary vegetables and coarser\r\ngrains the climate is not too rigorous. Splendid gardens were found as\r\nfar north as Nelson House, which is in the northern part of the area\r\nhere mapped. Proper drainage is needed, however, to bring much of the\r\nsurface into a condition fit for agriculture. Along the river banks this\r\nis evident, for while the strip bordering the streams produces a great\r\nvariety of grasses, shrubs and trees, a short distance back this is\r\nreplaced by a swamp covered by moss and stunted spruce. This is more\r\nnoticeable in the western part of Nelson valley, where the country is\r\nthickly covered by a coating of clay, and the surface is so uniformly\r\nlevel that its gradual slope to the east is not sufficient to drain it.\r\nThe areas to which it would be possible to introduce a system of\r\ndrainage, would at first be restricted to a narrow margin along the\r\nstreams. The northwest corner of the district for present purposes may\r\nbe classed as without a sufficient soil for agriculture. This may\r\nroughly be outlined as being composed of all the country lying to the\r\nwest of a line from the outlet of Burntwood lake to that of Reed lake,\r\nand north of the escarpment which shows the northern limit of the\r\nTrenton limestone. In this the surface is rolling and hilly, the rocky\r\nridges having a scanty coating of boulder clay and an occasional thicker\r\ndeposit in the depressions. It will probably remain the home of the\r\nhunter and the trapper.\r\n\r\n“To the south the country, underlain by limestone, has many of the\r\ncharacters of the northern part of old Manitoba. In the valley of the\r\nSaskatchewan there are large areas of rich soil formed principally by\r\nthe river itself, which has brought down an enormous amount of silt from\r\nthe upper part of its valley. The western part of the valley of Nelson\r\nriver is covered by a thick lacustral deposit which reaches west to\r\nBurntwood lake and east to the channel of Nelson river. In this area\r\ngood soil is found in almost every part and where drained would no doubt\r\nmake fair farming land.”\r\n\r\nMr. Wm. McInnes describes the country about Winisk and Attawapiskat\r\nrivers, explored by him in 1903, 1904 and 1905, as consisting of three\r\nareas, the first a limestone area, along the bay shore, the second a\r\nboulder clay area, behind it, and the third in rear of it again, a high\r\ninterior plateau. As to the latter area, he says:—“Although, considered\r\nas a whole, the central, elevated region cannot be spoken of as\r\ngenerally adapted for agriculture, there occur basins covered by heavy\r\ndeposits of stratified sand and clay that seem to have been laid down in\r\nlakes held in between barriers formed by the walls of the retreating\r\nglacier and ridges of drift. An examination of some of these clays by\r\nDoctor Hoffman shows them to be highly calcareous and somewhat\r\nsiliceous, a composition that with the admixture of the surface\r\nvegetable mould should produce an\r\n\r\n                EXCELLENT SOIL FOR GENERAL AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\nThe question of climate, which is, of course, of the utmost importance\r\nwhen considering the agricultural possibilities of a district, will be\r\nreferred to more particularly in another place. It may be said here,\r\nhowever, that the climatic conditions are, if somewhat adverse, not by\r\nany means prohibitory to the general cultivation of suitably situated\r\ntracts.\r\n\r\n“Muskeg, alternating with low ridges of gravel and boulders, covers wide\r\ntracts. It was noticed that the surface drainage became more perfect in\r\nthat part of the region extending westerly towards Trout\r\nlake. . . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n“The tract referred to as the boulder clay area consists of a broad belt\r\nof country, about one hundred and fifty-nine miles in width, lying\r\nbetween the Archaean highlands and the edge of the limestones of the\r\nbasin of Hudson bay, overlapping the latter, however, so that the\r\nsurface features of the two are generally quite similar. Gently\r\nundulating, and with a slight slope northerly and easterly, its general\r\nsurface aspect is that of a great swamp, sparsely covered with stunted\r\nand deformed trees, that reach a growth approaching their normal only\r\nalong the immediate banks of the rivers where drainage is afforded by\r\nfrequent short gullies into the trenches that constitute the river\r\nvalleys. The interior, to within a chain or two of the river-banks,\r\nowing to the impervious character of the till,\r\n\r\n                          IS QUITE UNDRAINED,\r\n\r\nand consequently covered by a thick deposit of sphagnum moss from two\r\nfeet to ten feet deep, the surface layer still growing, and even the\r\nbottom only bleached a little, but not at all oxidized. The short cool\r\nsummer season, and consequent low temperature of the water that\r\nsaturates the moss, is probably the principal reason for the absence of\r\nany of the visible effects of decay. The rivers flowing through this\r\nregion have no real valleys, that is to say, they occupy trenches but\r\nlittle wider than the immediate channels in which they flow, cut down\r\nthrough the stiff, tough till, which stands up in nearly vertical walls\r\nthat rise from the freshet mark on either side. At low stages of the\r\nwater a slanting beach, often paved with boulders, slopes gradually from\r\nthe foot of the bank to the edge of the diminished channel. A more or\r\nless continuous layer of marine clay, rich in fossil shells, overlies\r\nthe boulder clay, ensuring, wherever it is present, a soil of good\r\nquality. The absence of other than swamp vegetation must be ascribed,\r\nthen, to the almost total absence of drainage, and to the generally\r\nunfavorable climatic conditions.\r\n\r\n“In the matter of the actual cultivation of these northern areas we have\r\nlittle to go upon. At the Hudson’s Bay Company’s posts at Fort Hope and\r\nOsnaburgh potatoes have been grown and small gardens maintained from the\r\ntime of the establishment of the posts, and little difficulty has been\r\nexperienced in maturing the common garden vegetables of Ontario, though\r\noccasionally the frosts of late summer have cut off all but the hardier\r\nkinds. As the posts were located with a view to their favourable\r\nsituation for the purposes of the fur trade with the Indians, neither\r\none is situated on ground well suited for cultivation, and much better\r\nresults might reasonably be expected were trials made on more favorably\r\nsituated tracts. An Indian cultivating a small garden plot at the head\r\nof the Pineimuta branch of Attawapiskat river succeeds in raising good\r\ncrops of potatoes and turnips.”\r\n\r\nAs to this part of the country drained by Winisk and Attawapiskat\r\nrivers, Mr. McInnes in his report says:—“The climate, as would be\r\nexpected in these latitudes, and in a wilderness country approximately a\r\nthousand feet above sea-level, is somewhat severe. The summer\r\ntemperature, though on occasional days rising as high as 85° Fahr.,\r\naverages very much lower, and the nights are practically always cool.\r\nFrosty nights often continue into the early summer, and recur again in\r\nthe autumn before most grain-crops would be ready for harvesting.\r\nTemperatures were taken with the thermometer during two seasons, and\r\nthese, averaged, gave the following results for the months of July and\r\nAugust on lower Winisk river, and for July, August and part of September\r\non upper Winisk and upper Attawapiskat rivers:—\r\n\r\n                                              6 a.m. noon. 6 p.m.\r\n         Lower Winisk river                   57°    69°   57°\r\n         Upper Winisk and Attawapiskat rivers 47.5°  61.6° 58°\r\n\r\n“The only points in the region where any attempts at cultivation of the\r\nland are made are the two Hudson’s Bay Company’s posts at Osnaburgh,\r\nnear the foot of Lake St. Joseph, and at Fort Hope, on Eabamet lake.\r\n\r\n“At these posts small kitchen gardens and potato-fields are maintained\r\nwith some success, though neither place is favourably situated for the\r\npurpose, the soil in both cases consisting of an almost pure sand.\r\nTimothy and clover grow luxuriantly, and all the common\r\n\r\n                GARDEN VEGETABLES THRIVE AT BOTH PLACES.\r\n\r\nIndian corn, however, is not sufficiently filled out for table use when\r\ncaught by the frost. Barley has been successfully grown at Osnaburgh,\r\nand the potato crop, wherever a suitable tract of land has been\r\nutilized, has been generally fairly good at both places.\r\n\r\n“The first killing frost in 1903 occurred on the night of September 3,\r\nand in 1904 on the night of August 30.”\r\n\r\nMr. McInnes (Geol. Survey Report for 1906, pp. 87 and following)\r\ndescribes the region explored by him in that year as follows:—\r\n\r\n“It is bounded by north latitude 53° 50′ and 56° 10′, and by west\r\nlongitude 99° 15′ and 101° 15′. Its general elevation above the sea is\r\nbetween seven hundred and nine hundred feet. . . . . For purposes of\r\ngeneral description it may, in a broad way, be divided into three areas;\r\nthe limestone area embracing all the tract underlaid by the horizontal\r\nor gently undulating, magnesian limestones or dolomites of northern\r\nManitoba; the Archaean area, a somewhat broken and rugged country\r\nextending from the northern edge of the limestone escarpment northward\r\nand eastward until covered by the lacustrine sediments of the third or\r\nclay area. The latter, a gently rolling, clay-covered country, extends\r\nfrom the valley of Nelson river on the east to a contour, westerly,\r\nwhere the general elevation of the land is in the vicinity of nine\r\nhundred feet above the sea, or to approximately west longitude 99° 30′.\r\nThe northern edge of the clay basin was not reached, but the Indians of\r\nBurntwood river region agree in saying that Churchill river valley forms\r\nits most northerly extension. The last of the three divisions is,\r\ngenerally, well suited for cultivation, but throughout the first two the\r\nareas suitable for agriculture are of limited extent. No part of the\r\nregion is prairie though along some of the valleys, and here and there\r\non the uplands, are found extensive hay marshes, with only occasional\r\nsmall clumps of willows, that, with drainage, would become virtually\r\nprairie lands. . . . . Northwest of the Hudson’s Bay Company’s post at\r\nSplit lake the country is generally low, swampy and intersected by a\r\nnetwork of small lakes; near Waskaiowaka lake, however, an extension\r\nnortheasterly of the clay land of lower Burntwood valley forms a\r\ncomparatively dry ridge.”\r\n\r\n                       A GARDEN IN NEW MANITOBA.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Hudson’s Bay Company’s trading post at Norway House, Mr.\r\nMcInnes said:—“The chief factor in charge of the district cultivates a\r\nlarge garden, where, on June 10, peas, beans, beets and other vegetables\r\nwere well started. Wheat had been successfully grown here as well as at\r\nCross lake farther down the river, in latitude 54° 40′. There are many\r\ntracts of land along the river suitable for cultivation, though for long\r\nstretches the banks show only rounded surfaces of biotite gneiss, smooth\r\nand glaciated. The cultivable areas are confined to tracts overlain by\r\nlacustrine clays which alternate along the shores with glacial gravels\r\nand the bare rock surfaces devoid of any soil cover.”\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nMr. McInnes also reports:—“Below Cross lake no land is under\r\ncultivation until Split lake is reached, just north of latitude 56°,\r\nwhere the postmaster for the Hudson’s Bay Company raises potatoes and\r\nthe commoner garden vegetables.”\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nMr. McInnes reports that, ascending Burntwood river a few miles above\r\nOdei or Hart river, there is much land “apparently well adapted for\r\ncultivation. The clay is entirely free from boulders, and mixed near the\r\nsurface with enough vegetable humus to produce a friable and seemingly\r\nproductive soil. The gentle slopes give good natural drainage, and the\r\nopen character of the forests makes it a country easily cleared. For the\r\nnext nineteen miles the river valley and neighboring country present the\r\nsame general aspect. Where the valleys of the main river and the Odei\r\napproach one another they are separated only by a dividing ridge a\r\nlittle over a mile across, and a hundred and fifty feet high. The ridge\r\nis clay covered to the flat summit, where knolls of gneiss project.\r\nBeyond the valley of the Odei, to the north, is a rolling forested\r\ncountry with hills clay-covered to the tops, rising by gradual slopes to\r\nabout a hundred feet above the intervening valleys, that are themselves\r\nfrom twenty to fifty feet above the river level. For the next\r\ntwenty-eight miles the river, flowing in a rock-bound basin, has the\r\ncharacter of a long, narrow lake from half a mile to over a mile in\r\nwidth. Covering the well-rounded ledges of gneiss that form the\r\nimmediate shores is the same thick mantle of clay forming\r\n\r\n                A COUNTRY OF VERY ATTRACTIVE APPEARANCE.\r\n\r\nRising gradually from the river level to heights of from twenty to fifty\r\nfeet, a flat or gently sloping plateau extends back from two to three\r\nmiles to another rise, where the general level is increased to about a\r\nhundred feet. Recurring forest fires have not only denuded this section\r\nof its trees, but the stumps have for the most part been burned away, so\r\nthat it is now covered only by an open growth of small white birch,\r\npoplar, willow and Banksian pine, with an undergrowth of vetches,\r\ngrasses and small shrubs. Just above is Manasan falls where the river\r\npitches over a ledge of gneiss with a vertical descent of thirty feet.\r\n\r\n“Above Manasan falls,” Mr. McInnes continues, “the river expands again\r\nto form a long, narrow lake for the next ten miles of its upward course.\r\nThe same rolling clay plateau extends back from both shores of the lake,\r\nrising gradually to an undulating, higher tract, perhaps one hundred\r\nfeet above the lake level. The forest growth is still very open,\r\nallowing a good surface carpet of grasses, vetches and other vegetation.\r\nDiversified here and there by small open tracts where the grass-covered\r\nsurface is free from trees, this country often presents quite a\r\npark-like aspect. Throughout all the clay-covered region the absence of\r\nerratics is striking; for miles no perched boulders nor transported\r\nmaterials of any kind; other than the lacustrine sediments, are seen,\r\nand even the country rock is deeply hidden under the heavy clay deposits\r\nthat seem to be very homogeneous throughout, not laid down in thin\r\nlayers as in the case of many clays of apparently similar origin in\r\neastern Canada, but, if stratified at all, only in very heavy beds that\r\nseldom show their bedding planes. For the next fifteen miles to\r\nWuskwatim lake, the river has a quicker descent and its course is broken\r\nby several small rapids. The surrounding country is slightly higher,\r\nrising in places about two hundred feet above the river, and more\r\nsteeply from its shores. From the south shore a clay-covered bench a\r\nquarter of a mile wide rises to a comparatively steep slope to a height\r\nof one hundred and thirty feet, and extends back for miles at about that\r\nlevel, with a gently undulating surface, free from boulders or rock,\r\nexcepting very rare exposures. As a matter of fact, but one small knoll\r\nof the underlying rock was actually seen, rising through the clay at a\r\npoint about two miles back from the river. The Indians report that this\r\nplateau-like country extends right across to the valley of Grassy river\r\nwith only gently swelling ridges and no high hills.”\r\n\r\nMr. McInnes estimates the size of Wuskwatim lake as eight miles by four,\r\nwith a long bay extending to the west from its southern end. He states\r\nthat “on all sides of the lake are large tracts of\r\n\r\n                         NEARLY LEVEL CLAY LAND\r\n\r\nextending back for several miles at heights of from fifteen to fifty\r\nfeet above water level, and beyond that continuing at a level of a\r\nlittle over one hundred feet. . . . . The grass-covered slopes that rise\r\nwith very gentle gradients from the shores of the lake, make this a\r\ncountry of most attractive appearance and one that apparently would be\r\nwell suited for cultivation. The Indian inhabitants of this section\r\ncultivate with success small garden patches of potatoes.”\r\n\r\nCountry of the same general character, Mr. McInnes states, extends for\r\nthirty miles up the valley of the Burntwood above Wuskwatim lake.\r\n\r\nOn the shores of Footprint lake, in latitude 55° 45′, small fields of\r\npotatoes planted by the Indians were looking remarkably well, the vines\r\nbeing eleven inches in height and about ready to blossom when this\r\nlocality was visited by Mr. McInnes, July 10, 1906. Above the lake broad\r\nflats extend back from the river on both sides, rising, from half a mile\r\nto a mile back, to fifty feet above the river. The greater part of the\r\nflats and practically all the high land has been burned over within\r\ntwenty years, and is clothed now with an open growth of small mixed\r\ntimber; the land is free from boulders and gravel and has a good carpet\r\nof native grasses, including such good meadow forms as the blue-joint\r\n(_Calamagrostis canadensis_, _Calamagrostis hyperborea_) and the wild\r\nrye (_Elymus dasystachum_). The open character of the forest permits a\r\nsomewhat luxuriant growth of these grasses, mixed with vetches,\r\nstrawberry vines, etc., and with currant, gooseberry and other small\r\nshrubs and bushes.\r\n\r\n“The land lying to the southward of the most southerly bend of the river\r\nwas found to rise with a comparatively steep slope to a height of sixty\r\nfeet above the river, and to extend back as a level clay-covered plain\r\nwith about five inches of clay-loam soil well mixed with vegetable\r\nmatter gradually merging downwards into pure clay. The plateau has a\r\ngently rolling surface, the bottoms of the hollows, where small areas of\r\nmuskeg often occur, having a deviation forty feet lower than the slopes\r\nof the ridges, and the highest land reaching not more than one hundred\r\nfeet above the river. For six miles back, the areas of muskeg that are\r\nnot sphagnum swamps, but rather grassy marshes, are comparatively\r\ninsignificant in extent, the higher land, wooded with Banksian pine,\r\npoplar and spruce and diversified by many open grassy glades, largely\r\npreponderating. Beyond this, however, a broad belt of wet, grassy marsh\r\nland extends southwesterly across to the heads of brooks running into\r\nGrass river below Wekusko lake, and forms practically the western limit\r\nof the clay-covered uplands, though in the river valleys and along the\r\nflanks of their bordering hills the clay land extends much farther west.\r\n\r\n“Of the whole of this extensive plateau land, extending from the valley\r\nof the Nelson river westward to near Burntwood and Wekusko lakes (west\r\nlongitude 90° 45′), northerly to beyond latitude 56°, and southerly to\r\nthe limestone escarpment, an area of\r\n\r\n                    ABOUT TEN THOUSAND SQUARE MILES,\r\n\r\nit may be said to be characterized by a heavy clay soil entirely free\r\nfrom boulders. Lacustrine clays, composed of the rock flour once held in\r\nsuspension by glacial streams and deposited by them as they reached the\r\nquiet waters of a great lake, are essentially the soils of this region.\r\nThere is no distinct surface soil clearly separable from the clay\r\nsubsoil; the one merges gradually into the other, the clayey character\r\nof the soil being strongly apparent at the very surface where merely the\r\nshallow cover of decaying leaves and other vegetation is scraped away.\r\nGenerally, for from five inches to over a foot down, the clay is deep\r\nbrown in colour from the admixture of vegetable matter, and quite\r\nfriable, and rootlets of even the smaller surface vegetation reach down\r\nfar below this level, though on the tops of many of the ridges the\r\nlight-buff coloured clay, without any appreciable coloration from\r\nvegetable matter, comes quite to the surface. The rolling character of\r\nthe plateau generally provides fair drainage, but over considerable\r\nareas in its central portion, far from the valleys of the larger\r\nstreams, there are large tracts that have not sufficient gradients for\r\nthe proper flow of the surface water, and which could be made available\r\nfor agricultural uses only by being artificially drained. The western\r\nlimit of the good country is about longitude 99° 45′.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portage on Moose river.]\r\n\r\nMr. McInnes reports that the country lying to the south of Reed and\r\nWekusko lakes, and stretching to Saskatchewan valley, contains very few\r\ntracts of land suitable for settlement. Practically only the river\r\nvalleys, a few tracts adjoining some of the lakes, and parts of some of\r\nthe slopes flanking the limestone ridges, can be considered as affording\r\nland suitable for cultivation. The upland is generally almost bare of\r\nsoil, flat-lying limestones forming its actual surfaces, and the slopes,\r\nthough covered to a good depth by clay, are for the most part too\r\nbouldery for tillage. Limited tracts occur here and there, suitable for\r\nindividual holdings notably near some of the principal lakes. Of the\r\nagricultural possibilities of the country south of Reed and Wuskwatim\r\nlakes, Mr. McInnes writes:—“Experimentally but little is known of its\r\ncapabilities, though we have instances here and there throughout the\r\narea, to beyond its northerly limit, of the cultivation of all sorts of\r\ngarden vegetables, including, at The Pas,\r\n\r\n                       TOMATOES AND INDIAN CORN.\r\n\r\nOn September 6 of this year (1906), Indian corn well headed out was seen\r\nin Mr. Halcrow’s garden at the Hudson’s Bay Company’s post, the ears\r\nlarge and full and quite fit for table use. The Indian, never a very\r\nenthusiastic agriculturist, succeeds everywhere in getting good crops of\r\npotatoes, and at the homestead of an old settler named George Cowan, on\r\nCormorant lake, an exceptionally good yield of very large potatoes was\r\nbeing dug in September.”\r\n\r\nMr. McInnes, during his explorations in 1906, gave particular attention\r\nto the question of climate, which he rightly considered of vital\r\nimportance in connection with this region. He kept a careful record of\r\ntemperatures, and from the time it was begun, on June 19, until the\r\nnight of September 29, when the thermometer fell to 26, there was no\r\nfrost that affected even tender vegetation. On the night of August 10\r\nthe temperature fell to the freezing point, but did not get low enough\r\nto do damage, at least not in the valley of Grassy river, though some of\r\nthe potato vines on the summit of the high ridge north of The Pas were\r\nslightly touched. Mr. McInnes said he was convinced that the district is\r\nnot at all too cold for general agricultural operations. The longer\r\ndaily duration of summer sunlight in these high latitudes, he points out\r\nin his report, must be taken into consideration, and, for purposes of\r\ncomparison with more southerly localities, yearly averages of\r\ntemperature are of no value. A region lying in a higher latitude, though\r\nshowing a lower yearly average temperature, may, during the growing\r\nmonths, owing to its longer hours of sunshine, have quite as good an\r\naverage as one farther south. Mr. McInnes’s record showed that during\r\nJuly the temperature at 6 o’clock p.m. was equal to or higher than the\r\nnoon temperature on fifteen days; during August on nine days; during\r\nSeptember on eight days. The 6 p.m. averages for these months were lower\r\nthan the noon averages by only 1°, 1½° and 2° respectively. For the\r\npurpose of comparison, Mr. McInnes procured from the Director of the\r\nMeteorological Service at Toronto an abstract of the same summer’s\r\ntemperatures at Minnedosa, Stony Mountain, Hillview and Brandon, and,\r\ncomparing them with his record, he concluded that the country along the\r\nroute of the proposed railway to the bay\r\n\r\n                        IS CONSPICUOUSLY WARMER\r\n\r\nthan the same latitude four hundred miles further east.\r\n\r\nMr. McInnes, examined before the select committee of the Senate in 1907,\r\ndeclared that the whole region from Split lake to a line about forty\r\nmiles north of the Saskatchewan is a clay-covered country. After leaving\r\nSplit lake, ascending the river, this clay-covered country shows\r\nabsolutely no boulders and no gravel. Even the shores of the lakes,\r\nuntil you reach a height of about eight hundred feet, show no gravel\r\nbars at all. There is absolutely nothing to interfere with the\r\ncultivation of the soil there. It is a country that has been burnt over.\r\nThe witness assumed that Burntwood river got its name that way. It has\r\nbeen subject to repeated burns. At the present time it is covered by a\r\nvery open forest. Grasses grow fairly luxuriantly. There are two species\r\nof this, blue joint grass and a wild rye, that are the prevailing\r\ngrasses. He understood from Professor Macoun, though he was not very\r\nfamiliar with the grasses himself, that these are very excellent meadow\r\ngrasses, and make excellent fodder. Mr. McInnes left Norway House in the\r\nsecond week of June, and made the circuit and came out at The Pas on\r\nSeptember 6, so it was in June, July and August he was there. He saw\r\ngrass growing from eighteen inches to two feet high.\r\n\r\nThe witness computed the area of this country at about ten thousand\r\nsquare miles. He did not mean to say, he explained, that all of that ten\r\nthousand square miles is good land, but the basin characterized by this\r\ndeposit of clay has an area of about ten thousand square miles. It is\r\nbounded on the north by Churchill river. The witness was at about the\r\ncentre of the basin. The Indians told him it extended north to the basin\r\nof Churchill river. Beyond that, northwards, mud and gravel took the\r\nplace of clay. Starting at The Pas and proceeding towards Churchill, the\r\nwitness first passed through about one hundred and forty miles of\r\ncountry underlaid by the flat limestone of northern Manitoba. He walked\r\nfor miles over\r\n\r\n                     HILLS OF ALMOST BARE LIMESTONE\r\n\r\nwith hardly any soil. Beyond that—that is, about the contour he had\r\nspoken of where this clay was deposited, there is about one hundred and\r\nseventy miles to Split lake (Split lake is about two hundred and fifty\r\nmiles from The Pas), possibly in a straight line about as the railway is\r\nprojected, that is characterized by these clay deposits.\r\n\r\nAs to the flat country in Keewatin, beyond this clay area, it is a\r\ncountry of a different character. The witness proceeded from the Albany\r\none hundred miles across country by the portage route to a large lake on\r\nAgnooski river and then another one hundred miles across to Winisk lake,\r\nand down Winisk river to the sea, and he crossed through the country\r\nbetween Agnooski and Winisk by three different routes, perhaps forty or\r\nfifty miles east and west from one route to the next, and the country is\r\nvery much the same character. It is a country that is very much denuded.\r\nThe country generally is characterized by hills of boulder and gravel\r\nand intermediate valleys very largely muskeg. Except in the immediate\r\nvalleys of the larger rivers there is very little land that would be\r\nsuitable for agriculture. From one hundred and fifty miles inland down\r\nto the sea, the country is of an entirely different character again;\r\nthat is to say, it is country that is originally overlain by from a very\r\nfew feet at its edge to one hundred feet or more, a very tough\r\nimpervious boulder clay, which holds up the water, and on which the\r\ndrainage, up to the present time, is of a very imperfect character. The\r\npresent drainage of that area is comparatively recent, and imperfect. An\r\ninstance of its imperfection is seen in Winisk river. There is a lake\r\nnear the head of the Winisk from which the main river flows, and from\r\nwhich the west branch flows north. They come together at a point\r\n(following the main stream) two hundred and fifty miles below, inclosing\r\nan island two hundred and fifty miles long. There are two other islands\r\nof this character\r\n\r\n                          ALONG WINISK RIVER,\r\n\r\none eighty miles in length and the other about fifty.\r\n\r\nThe Winisk is a good large river. Mr. McInnes estimated the flow at some\r\ntwenty-five thousand cubic feet per second. It runs in size somewhere\r\nbetween the Gatineau and the Ottawa, not quite so large as the Ottawa,\r\nbut larger than the Gatineau. Over the whole of the country in the last\r\none hundred and fifty miles down to Hudson bay, granting the proper\r\nclimate and proper drainage, this green clay would make an excellent\r\nsoil. In fact it is quite the same as the clay in the vicinity of\r\nOttawa, practically clay of the same soil, and is very impervious. There\r\nare little streams running into the sides of the river, but they cut\r\nvery sharp-walled trenches, as steep as boulder clay will stand, and\r\nthat means an angle of say sixty degrees, eighty to ninety feet high.\r\nYou get on top of these banks and you have a mossy place, sometimes six\r\nfeet of moss. It is never peat, never having turned into peat. It is\r\nsimply a green moss which is pressed into layers of a couple of feet in\r\nthickness at the bottom of the six or ten feet, but never apparently\r\noxydized or never carbonized at all, practically unchanged. The growth\r\nis going on still. It is merely the successive layers which are pressed\r\ndown by subsequent layers on top of them, so that in places the\r\nthickness is quite ten feet. There are no grasses in that mossy district\r\nin the valley of the Winisk. A river of that size in places has some\r\nshores, perhaps a quarter of a mile, here and there, beyond the actual\r\nshore of the river, and it is grassy there. That is, there are\r\noccasional bottom lands, but there is no extent of them. Mr. McInnes did\r\nnot think there is an agricultural country in that eastern district. It\r\nis entirely different from the country of which he had been previously\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\nUpon Nelson river wheat has been grown successfully at Norway House, and\r\nalso at Cross lake. The Hudson’s Bay Company grow no grain at any of\r\ntheir Keewatin posts nowadays. In the old days they grew it and ground\r\nit in hand mills. Mr. McInnes saw potatoes that were grown about fifty\r\nmiles north of The Pas. “They were quite showy potatoes, great large\r\nfellows like those you see exhibited in fairs—tremendously large, grown\r\non practically new land, and they had a very large crop of them.” There\r\nare no settlers in Nelson district. The Indians, however, grow potatoes\r\nat several points, even in the northern part of it, as far north as\r\nNelson House, about latitude 55° 50′. On July 11, when Mr. McInnes\r\narrived at Nelson House, the Indian potatoes had vines about eleven\r\ninches high, and were almost ready to flower. When he got out on\r\nSeptember 6 to the Saskatchewan, at the Hudson’s Bay post there, at The\r\nPas, Indian corn was very well headed out, with very large fine ears\r\nquite ready for table use, and there was no frost until September 29. He\r\nknew that because he stayed there until then.\r\n\r\nWith eighteen hours of the daylight, and no frost in the summer,\r\nvegetation is rapid. In a country where you can ripen Indian corn you\r\ncan grow practically anything.\r\n\r\nMr. McInnes explained that he could not closely indicate the isothermal\r\nline on the part of the country he had explored the previous year, but\r\nhe could say that the country averaged in the summer months from four to\r\nfive degrees higher temperature than the same latitude farther west. He\r\nthought that\r\n\r\n                          THE ISOTHERMAL LINE\r\n\r\nwhich would go past the north end of the country he had been speaking\r\nof, would come down as far as the north shore of Lake Superior, which\r\nwould be a very long distance south. He had records kept during all\r\nsummer of the temperatures through that western country, and he had a\r\nsummary of the record kept in the preceding summers. He was rather\r\nsurprised at the warmth of that western country in summer, and at the\r\nway heat kept up in the evenings. He kept the thermometer readings\r\nmorning, noon and six o’clock in the evening, and found the six o’clock\r\ntemperatures were almost as warm as the noon temperatures. That country\r\nhas a very long day in summer. The day in those high latitudes is very\r\nmuch longer, and the growing time proportionately longer. In June they\r\nhave about eighteen hours of daylight.\r\n\r\nAs to the district where he found the one hundred and seventy miles of\r\nagricultural land he had described, he reached there only about the\r\nmiddle of June. There was no frost in the balance of June or in July,\r\nand no frost in August, excepting once, on, he thought, the 29th, when\r\nthe thermometer dropped just to freezing point. There was not enough\r\nfrost to touch vegetation at all in the valley of the river where he\r\nwas. He noticed when he got out to the Saskatchewan there was rather a\r\nhigh ridge on which there were a lot of half-breed settlers. He got\r\nthere on September 6, and noticed on top of the hills where they had\r\npotatoes that they had been touched just on the tops, but down in the\r\nvillages the potatoes in the garden of the Hudson’s Bay post had not\r\nbeen touched at all. He presumed that was the frost on August 29.\r\n\r\nOwen O’Sullivan, C.E., of the Geological Survey of Canada, was one of\r\nthe witnesses before the Senate committee of 1907. He explained that in\r\n1904 he was engaged as assistant to Mr. Wilson in examining the west\r\ncoast of James bay. They went up the river Kapiskau for one hundred and\r\nfifty miles and surveyed it, and found mostly swampy ground, right to\r\nabout the headwaters of the Kapiskau, longitude 86°. His impression was\r\nthat the whole coast from the southern extremity of James bay, at the\r\nmouth of the Hurricane, up to Cape Henrietta Maria, for an average of\r\none hundred miles in depth, is mostly swampy ground. It is partly peat\r\nand wet spagnol (wet moss). There is a bluff of small spruce isolated\r\nhere and there.\r\n\r\nIn 1905 he was sent to survey the coast between York Factory and Cape\r\nHenrietta Maria. The shore between these points was swampy as far inland\r\nas he could walk in two or three days.\r\n\r\nMr. O’Sullivan testified that during the summer of 1906 he started from\r\nSplit lake, on the Nelson, and made for the headwaters of Little\r\nChurchill river, going down the Little Churchill to the Big Churchill.\r\nThe country between Split lake and Big lake is mostly swampy. The\r\ncountry about Big lake is a good loamy soil, with easy slopes\r\nsurrounding the lakes. From Big lake to the Big Churchill the country is\r\nrocky and swampy, with a good deal of good loamy soil in places—a rich\r\nclay loam. The rock is mostly granite and gneiss. It is very hard to\r\nfind out whether the land is suitable for agriculture on such an\r\nexpedition. It is hard to know the extent of the soil, but Mr.\r\nO’Sullivan thought\r\n\r\n               THE CLIMATE WAS SUITABLE FOR AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of boulders all through the country, but it is possible\r\nto cultivate what there is of the land. There are places where the land\r\nextends to the size of a dozen townships, and then there would be three\r\nor four times that much without having in it enough arable land to make\r\na good-sized township. In the vicinity of Churchill there is grass in\r\nthe valleys of very good quality. It occurs about half-way down the\r\nLittle Churchill.\r\n\r\nGood potatoes are raised at Split lake. Mr. O’Sullivan had obtained a\r\nbag of potatoes grown there. They were rather small, but very palatable.\r\nThat was in June, and they were grown the previous year. Split lake from\r\nthe coast, by the Nelson, would be about one hundred and seventy-five\r\nmiles. He went down Nelson river and north to Churchill. The general\r\ncharacter of the country from James bay farther north is good,\r\nagriculturally. The country from Split lake rises to Wabishkok about two\r\nhundred feet. That is about thirty miles in a straight line. Besides\r\npotatoes, he had seen turnips, cabbage and lettuce growing, and all\r\nappeared to be very good. The potato vines in September were touched\r\nwith frost rather severely. The potatoes were taken up on August 23 and\r\n25, 1906.\r\n\r\nMr. O’Sullivan stated that he had been up near the head of Lake\r\nWinnipeg, where the river leaves the lake. There is good agricultural\r\nland around there. He never had such good potatoes as at Cross lake. He\r\ndid not see them growing, but had them in June and also in September.\r\nThe June potatoes would be the previous crop, and the September ones\r\npossibly the new crop. They do not grow any grain there; they have no\r\ncattle, and there are no settlers in there. The Hudson’s Bay factor\r\nraised the potatoes. He had just enough to keep his own family. He had\r\nthem in three or four different quarters. Mr. O’Sullivan saw lettuce and\r\nturnips growing at Churchill.\r\n\r\nMr. J. W. McLaggan, of Strathcona, Alberta, in 1907, made an exploratory\r\ntrip over a portion of the same country as Mr. McInnes, but going\r\nfarther west. He left Prince Albert on August 2 and reached The Pas on\r\nAugust 15. On August 25 he crossed Clearwater lake. He describes the\r\ncountry he passed through as low and swampy, and\r\n\r\n                       WILD BERRIES OF ALL KINDS\r\n\r\nas plentiful. The land north of Cormorant lake he found to be of good\r\nclay loam, and capable of being farmed successfully on a small scale\r\nafter being cleared. A garden of potatoes, turnips, carrots and cabbages\r\nlooked well, and on August 27\r\n\r\n                      SHOWED NO EVIDENCE OF FROST.\r\n\r\nOn upper Cowan river there are small hay meadows; the rest of the land\r\nis poor and hard to clear. Approaching Reed lake the soil is a clay loam\r\nwhich could be farmed if drained. The country about Herb lake and river\r\nis rocky, with patches of fair land, suitable for raising vegetable and\r\ngarden produce. When the rapids of Grass river are passed the country\r\nbecomes low, but in places there is good soil of clay loam with sand,\r\nand towards Setting lake there are good hay meadows. Although the\r\ncountry between Setting and Paint lakes is very rough and rocky, there\r\nis some good land. To the north of Paint lake there is a limited\r\nquantity of good land; about Methy lake Mr. McLaggan considers the land\r\nof little value for farming. Between Reed lake and Elbow lake there are\r\nsome small spots of good land, but as a general thing the country is\r\nrough, rocky and swampy. The country between Elbow and Cranberry lakes\r\nis mainly muskeg. There are some patches of good land towards the lower\r\nend of Cranberry lake. There are some small hay meadows between\r\nCranberry and Athapapuskow lakes, but the ground is generally rocky with\r\nsome muskeg. There are some stretches of fairly good land along the\r\nlower part of Goose river but the country generally is rough and rocky.\r\nThe country about the upper end of Goose lake was found to be boggy and\r\nof very little use.\r\n\r\n                   ALONG GOOSE RIVER, BELOW THE LAKE,\r\n\r\nthere is quite a tract of fairly good land, and there is another on the\r\nSturgeon, between the mouth of Goose river and Cumberland lake. The soil\r\nis a clay loam mixed with a little sand. It is covered with brush and\r\nsmall poplar and would be easy to clear.\r\n\r\nMr. McLaggan, after his trip, stated that the growing season seemed to\r\nbe satisfactory, “and where good land is found there should be no\r\ntrouble to raise good crops of all hardy grains and vegetables, but the\r\ngreatest drawback to farming would be the difficulty of making waggon\r\nroads from place to place, as the country between the spots of good land\r\nis rough and rocky.”\r\n\r\nThe climate seemed good to Mr. McLaggan. In the first week of September\r\nthe foliage was green; there was no sign of severe frost, and\r\nbutterflies, hornets and other insects were numerous and active. The\r\nfirst frost noted was on August 31, “but not enough to damage wheat.”\r\nThe weather was fine in the morning and it rained in the afternoon. On\r\nSeptember 13 he noted that the weather was fine but cold, with a heavy\r\nfrost in the morning; that the leaves were falling, and that it began to\r\nlook like autumn. Considerable rain followed, which, on October 4, gave\r\nplace to snow, to be followed again by rain. The night of October 7 is\r\nnoted as the first really cold one of the season, but the morning\r\nbrought rain. There was snow again on October 8 with high wind and ice\r\non the water along the shore of Goose lake. It was “fine and warm” on\r\nOctober 11, and “clear and cold” on October 13 when he reached The Pas\r\non his return.\r\n\r\nW. Thibaudeau, C.E., states in his report (See p. 23):—“At Churchill,\r\npotatoes, turnips and other vegetables have been successfully raised at\r\nthe Hudson’s Bay Company’s fort. For many years cattle and horses have\r\nbeen successfully kept and bred at the Hudson’s Bay post; excellent\r\nbutter was also made. Splendid pasture and hay meadows are found on both\r\nsides of the river above the harbour for a known distance of thirty-five\r\nmiles. At the head of Button bay there is an area of two thousand acres\r\nupon which\r\n\r\n                          GOOD HAY CAN BE CUT,\r\n\r\nwhich has been pronounced by Professor Macoun as affording excellent\r\nforage. Wild black and red currants and gooseberries are found in great\r\nquantities, and are equal, if not superior in flavour, to garden\r\nproduce. Barrels of black currants can be picked around Fort Prince of\r\nWales. Cranberries exist in great abundance everywhere. Other berries\r\nwhich are indigenous to the climate abound.”\r\n\r\nAs to the region examined in his exploration trip from Churchill to The\r\nPas, Mr. Thibaudeau states:—\r\n\r\n“About thirty-five per cent. of the country travelled through is marshy\r\nand swampy; more or less hay is grown. Under marsh or swamps the soil is\r\ngenerally clay. I have no doubt that when the swamps and marshes are\r\ndrained, and the moss is stripped, they will be susceptible to farming\r\noperations between Churchill and The Pas, and at a later period, after\r\nthe northwest is settled, this land will become valuable.”\r\n\r\nMr. John Armstrong, in his report of the preliminary survey conducted\r\nunder his direction in 1908 and 1909 for the proposed railway to Hudson\r\nbay, mentions that as the greater portion of the survey work was\r\ncompleted during the winter months when the ground was frozen and\r\ncovered with snow, it was impossible to obtain much information on the\r\nsubject of agricultural land and minerals. He continues:—“It may be\r\nremarked here, however, that although these lands may require more or\r\nless improvement in the way of clearing and drainage, the fact that they\r\nare situated within a few hours’ run of an ocean port may give to these\r\nlands a value not hitherto thought of, and may cause a more rapid\r\nsettlement than expected. At the inland Hudson’s Bay Company’s posts all\r\nkinds of grain and vegetables have been grown successfully for years. A\r\nstudy of the records of the Meteorological Office indicates that the\r\nclimate is quite as favourable for farming operations as that of Prince\r\nAlbert.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Typical country on Hudson Bay Railway Survey.]\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1910, an inspection of the timber along the line of\r\nthe proposed Hudson Bay Railway from The Pas to Split lake was made by\r\nJ. R. Dickson, B.S.A., M.S.F., Assistant Inspector of Dominion Forest\r\nReserves, and his report was printed by the Forestry Branch of the\r\nDepartment of the Interior, as a Special Bulletin (No. 17) in 1911. Mr.\r\nDickson’s exploration covered a distance of some two hundred and\r\nthirty-five miles along the line of railway. The line of inspection\r\nfollowed was along the waterways on the northwest side of\r\n\r\n                     THE PROPOSED LINE OF RAILWAY,\r\n\r\nfrom which men were sent in at intervals of a few miles in each\r\ndirection so as to locate the timber. On the return journey the waterway\r\nroute to the south of the line was taken and similar inspections made\r\nfrom it. The special object was to locate and estimate the areas of\r\ncommercially valuable timber that could be made use of in the work of\r\nconstructing the railways, and as a result a good idea of the character\r\nand location of the timber along the line has been obtained.\r\n\r\nThe route followed by the party was from The Pas to Moose lake, thence\r\nby portage to Mitishto river, down that stream and via Setting, Paint,\r\nWintering, Landing and Sipiwesk lakes to Cross lake. From the last\r\nmentioned lake the party crossed to Minago river, and via that stream,\r\nMoose lake and the Saskatchewan returned to The Pas. The area covered\r\nwas estimated by Mr. Dickson at eight thousand square miles. In addition\r\nto the information about the timber of this district given in this\r\nreport there are many facts as to the topography of the country and its\r\nnatural resources.\r\n\r\nMr. Dickson’s party found that except for a varying percentage of rock\r\noutcrop usually in the form of low ridges covered by stunted jackpines,\r\nthere is a great muskeg extending northeast along the whole course of\r\nMitishto river, and appearing in fact to blanket the entire watershed in\r\nthe region between Saskatchewan and Grass river systems.\r\n\r\nMr. Dickson’s exploring party, in passing from Setting lake to Cross\r\nlake, by way of Paint, Wintering, Landing and Sipiwesk lakes, traversed\r\npart of the so-called “clay-belt” which, according to Mr. Dickson’s\r\nreport “contains upon the whole from fifty per cent. to seventy-five per\r\ncent. of arable land and probably has\r\n\r\n                      A GOOD AGRICULTURAL FUTURE.”\r\n\r\nThe report as to the rocks and soils of the area explored says:—“The\r\nbedrock for one hundred miles northeast of The Pas is\r\nlimestone—probably largely dolomite—and it frequently obtrudes through\r\nthe muskegs or shallow soils which blanket it. These outcrops form low,\r\nnarrow, flattened ridges, rising just above the general level of the\r\nmuskeg, and nearly always running northeast and southwest. The line of\r\ncontact between this limestone area and the Laurentian granite (upon\r\nwhich it rests conformably) runs northwest and southeast from a point\r\nten miles east of Limestone bay on Lake Winnipeg across the southwest\r\nend of Hill lake on Minago river to Cameron falls on the Mitishto,\r\nthence passing in a westerly direction along the south shores of Reed,\r\nWekusko and Cranberry lakes. Along this line, especially in the vicinity\r\nof Hill lake, there is a zone of deep clays of very promising\r\nagricultural value. In the area of granite farther north, the whole\r\nfuture, so far as agriculture or forestry is concerned, depends upon the\r\ngeneral depth of the boulder clay. From the mere fact that it is a drift\r\ndeposit, this depth constantly varies, but only a detailed soil survey\r\nof each township could show where and how much. There are large areas of\r\nalmost pure rock outcrop and muskeg of little or no value even for\r\ntimber production. But in general, over the great clay belt, the soil,\r\nwhich is almost uniformly\r\n\r\n                     A VERY TENACIOUS BOULDER CLAY\r\n\r\n(nearly free of boulders, however), averages between four and twelve\r\nfeet in depth, quite deep enough, therefore, for cultivation. It must be\r\nunderstood that no hard and fast boundary line can be laid down as\r\nshowing the confines of this clay belt. The change is often so gradual,\r\nand so many as yet unknown factors enter—as, for instance, soil depth\r\nand possibilities of drainage—that any estimate of the bounds, area and\r\naverage arable content of this belt can, with our present very limited\r\nknowledge, be given only in general terms. I estimate the area of that\r\nportion included from north to south between Wintering and Cross lakes,\r\nand from east to west between Setting and Sipiwesk lakes at two thousand\r\nsquare miles.\r\n\r\n“With regard to soil conditions, drainage is the great necessity\r\neverywhere. To render the soil fertile for cropping, the heavy stiff\r\nboulder clay must be opened up to the action of the air. Probably the\r\nuse of a subsoil plough might obviate the necessity for underdrainage\r\nover large areas. But however secured, aëration is necessary to change\r\nthe present cold, dead, impervious soil to a warm, porous, friable one,\r\nfull of bacterial life, available plant food, and resulting fertility.\r\nThe soil is exactly similar to that around Cochrane in New Ontario,\r\nwhich yields such large returns under right treatment.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dickson says in his report:—“The climate and the soil conditions\r\nare the two basic factors which determine farming value. Where frequent\r\nor recent fires have not resulted in the formation of purely ‘temporary’\r\nor ‘fire types’—as e.g., young jackpine on heavy clay—a study of the\r\nexisting flora answers many questions as to the climate and the soil. On\r\nwell-drained spots as far north as Split lake the flora is almost\r\nidentical with that of similar sites in Riding mountains of Manitoba,\r\nproving that during the growing season these localities lie under one\r\nand the same isotherm, or nearly so, And yet Riding mountains are nearly\r\nfour hundred miles southwest of Split lake. Two other factors which help\r\nvegetation in this northern clay belt are the low absolute\r\nelevation—only five hundred to seven hundred feet—and the large\r\nproportion of sunlight during the growing season, because of the long\r\nday. No doubt also the large proportion of the country covered by water\r\nhas a tendency to prevent late spring and early fall frosts. In the\r\nabsence of weather records, it is impossible to say whether the summer\r\nof 1910 was an average season or not, but certainly it was favourable\r\nfor farming operations. There were showers every week and the growth of\r\nthe native vegetation\r\n\r\n                          WAS AMAZINGLY RAPID.\r\n\r\nThe total annual precipitation, including two or three feet of snow,\r\nwould appear to be about the same as for western Ontario, to wit, thirty\r\nto forty inches. At Cross lake no damaging frosts occurred between June\r\n8 and September 11, an interval of ninety-three days. But as a\r\n‘sixty-day’ oat or barley in Ontario will mature in that region in\r\nforty-five or fifty days—a general rule which applies as well to\r\nfruits, roots and vegetables—there would appear to be no difficulty\r\nfrom a climatic standpoint in growing all the hardier products of the\r\ntemperate zone. The size and the quality of the wild fruits between\r\nSetting and Split lakes were first-class. During the last week of July\r\nwe enjoyed ripe raspberries, gooseberries, black and red currants,\r\nblueberries, saskatoons and strawberries (late ones). The first three\r\nmentioned were especially fine—the bushes loaded down with fruit as\r\nlarge and juicy as many tame varieties in Ontario. The average\r\ntemperature of the growing season is about 60° Fahrenheit. Certainly\r\nvegetables will grow to perfection anywhere between Cross lake and\r\nNelson House. At the former we ate potatoes weighing a pound and a half\r\neach, dug on the last day of August, and when we left on September 10\r\nthe corn and tomatoes were still untouched by frost. I would\r\nrespectfully point out the advisability of the Dominion Government\r\nplacing several small experimental stations at suitable points within\r\nthe limits of this clay belt to make careful test of its seasonal\r\nvariations and cropping possibilities. When the railway is completed\r\nsuch information will be of the utmost value to intending settlers. The\r\nwinters are quite as enjoyable as in Manitoba—probably more so. Mr.\r\nClifford, one of the railway location engineers, who has spent two years\r\nbetween The Pas and Split lake, assured me that he\r\n\r\n                     LIKED THE WINTER SEASON THERE\r\n\r\nmuch better than the summer. Whereas in many parts of the continent the\r\nsummer of 1910 was a peculiarly dry one, in Keewatin it was just the\r\nopposite. Rain fell frequently, and high winds, especially nor’easters\r\nfrom Hudson bay, were almost constant and occasioned us some loss of\r\ntime on the larger lakes.”\r\n\r\nMr. William Beech, for many years back, and still, a resident of\r\nChurchill, in a communication to the press in 1911, wrote:—“The opinion\r\ngenerally entertained concerning the country around the bay and at\r\nChurchill is that it is a barren waste, covered with ice and snow for\r\nthe greater part of the year, and devoid of any vegetation whatever. The\r\nopinion is an erroneous one. At the head of the bay there is an area of\r\nfrom two thousand to three thousand acres where in the summer months\r\ngood hay can be cut, and which Professor Macoun has pronounced as\r\naffording excellent forage. There are many other places also where the\r\nsame condition exists, and where the country is covered with a rich\r\nthick growth of grass. It would surprise you, wouldn’t it, if I should\r\ntell you that there are at least half a dozen different species of wild\r\nfruit which flourish in great abundance in the rocks and among the\r\nmosses throughout the country round the bay. Wild black and red\r\ncurrants, gooseberries, cranberries, crowfoot berries, and baked apple\r\nberries may be gathered by the bushel in season, and make the very best\r\nof preserves, so that we don’t really have to depend on dried apples up\r\nthere as many of you imagine. As for vegetables, I have seen radishes,\r\nlettuce, and turnips raised right at Churchill.\r\n\r\n“Of course it is generally understood that the winter climate of the\r\ncountry round the bay is usually very severe. The lowest temperature I\r\nhave experienced there, however, was 39° below zero on Nov. 29, 1906,\r\nwith a strong wind blowing from the bay, which intensified the cold. It\r\nis exceedingly rare to have winds off the bay in the winter months. In\r\nwinter the wind is generally from the west and northwest, while in\r\nsummer it is generally from the east and northeast. I have always found\r\nthe thermometer lower one hundred and fifty miles inland. It can never\r\nbe called dark in the north, even in the depth of winter.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[14] It will be observed that part of this evidence treats of other\r\ndistricts than the one immediately under consideration; but it cannot\r\nconveniently be eliminated here without awkwardly dislocating Mr.\r\nTyrrell’s evidence.—(E. J. C.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE KEEWATIN AREA.\r\n\r\n                (Newest Ontario and Northern Manitoba.)\r\n\r\n                   Tree Growth and Timber Resources.\r\n\r\n   Considerable Areas of Good Timber.—The Range of the More\r\n     Important Trees.—The Banskian Pine.—Forests of Trees in Many\r\n     Places that Would Make Good Logs, and Much Pulp Wood.—\r\n     Occasional Beautiful Forests of Aspen Poplar.—Magnificent\r\n     Coniferous Forest Northwest of Lake Winnipeg.—Water Power on\r\n     the Nelson.—Destruction Wrought by Forest Fires.—Ample Supply\r\n     of Timber For Fuel.\r\n\r\nThere is considerable evidence showing that there are, in different\r\nsections of the territory immediately west and south of Hudson bay,\r\nconsiderable areas of useful timber.\r\n\r\nMr. Richard White, one of the witnesses examined before the Hudson Bay\r\nInvestigation Committee in 1749 (See p. 8), stated that he saw fir-trees\r\non the banks of Albany river thirty-five or forty feet long, and\r\nfourteen or sixteen inches square at the bottom, and ten at the top, and\r\nhere and there a small stick of birch; that there were a great many\r\nother small pines; but he did not know whether pitch or tar could be\r\nmade from them, never having seen a trial.\r\n\r\nRev. John Semmens (See p. 36) writes:—“There is a good deal of timber\r\nin the valleys and on the islands and lakes of Burntwood river course,\r\nthough it is sprucy and inclined to be small. I have cut timber as large\r\nas two feet in diameter at the butt and fifty feet in height, but this\r\nis exceptional. From ten to fifteen inches near the ground is a better\r\nestimate of the average size of the trees. The very name of this river\r\nsuggests the historic fact that the natives of the country deliberately\r\nand habitually set the woods on fire, their object being to attract the\r\ndeer which are known to be fond of the sweet grass which springs from\r\nthe ashes of a fire swept surface. The result is that large tracts of\r\ncountry are denuded of their rich first growth of trees, and young\r\nforests are just coming into the middle stages of growth, while many of\r\nthe hills stand bald and bare, giving silent evidence of the severity of\r\nsuccessive visitations of the devouring flame. Yet the charred stumps\r\nand tangled roots here and there speak of a deep and fertile soil, as\r\nwell as of possibilities of growth which few have associated with a\r\nso-called ‘frozen north.’ However, all the timber necessary for railroad\r\npurposes and for the use of settlers in building or for commercial\r\ncordwood can be found almost anywhere, the latter in illimitable\r\nquantities.”\r\n\r\nDoctor Robert Bell of the Geological Survey, in his report of his\r\nexplorations in the\r\n\r\n                 VALLEYS OF NELSON AND CHURCHILL RIVERS\r\n\r\nin 1879, states:—“Spruce and tamarac timber are found growing near the\r\nsea coast, in favorable situations as far as Seal river, beyond which\r\ntheir northeastern limit curves inland. The spruce, although not growing\r\nas a continuous forest quite as far north as Churchill, is still found\r\nof sufficient size in the neighborhood of this post to be used for\r\nbuilding houses, boats, etc. The balsam poplar is rare and of small size\r\nat Churchill. White birch which was found on the main river, eighteen\r\nmiles above the forks, is said to occur at about sixty or seventy miles\r\nwest of the mouth of the river.”\r\n\r\nDoctor Bell proceeds in his report to describe the range of the most\r\nimportant trees over the area covered by his exploits as follows:—\r\n\r\n“White Spruce—(the ‘Pine’ of Rupert’s Land),—This is the most northern\r\nconiferous tree. On the east side of Hudson bay the last of it is seen\r\non the coast a short distance north of Richmond gulf. On the west side\r\nit terminates about Seal river. Thence its limit runs northwesterly, and\r\nis reported to cross Mackenzie river about two hundred miles below Peel\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n“Tamarack,—(also called ‘Juniper’ and ‘Red Spruce’)—On the east side\r\nof the bay it accompanies the spruce almost to the extreme limit. It is\r\nabundant at York Factory. Along the lower part of Nelson river it is of\r\nfair size, but on the Churchill it becomes small towards the sea. Its\r\nnorthern limit runs northwestward to Mackenzie river which it is said to\r\ncross below Peel river.\r\n\r\n“Balsam Fir:—(also called ‘Single Spruce’ and ‘Silver Pine’)—Abundant\r\naround the southern part of James bay and on good dry soil along Albany\r\nriver. Mr. Cochrane reports it as common around Island lake, but scarcer\r\non God’s lake. It is rare and of small size on Knee lake. In going down\r\nNelson river, it is scarce below Sea River falls, and the last tree\r\nwhich I observed was at the outlet of Sipiwesk lake. On Grass river some\r\ngood-sized trees were seen as far north as Standing Rock rapid.\r\n\r\n“Balsam Poplar:—(‘Rough-barked Poplar’, ‘Cotton Tree’, ‘Balm of\r\nGilead’, etc.)—On the west side of Hudson bay, this is the most\r\nnorthern species of poplar. It is abundant around York Factory, and\r\nattains a fair size along the lower part of Nelson river. In descending\r\nthe Great Churchill it becomes smaller and scarcer until the mouth of\r\nthe river is reached, when it is rare.\r\n\r\n“Aspen:—(‘Trembling-leaved Poplar’)—This tree, which is so abundant\r\nand of such a thrifty growth around the southern part of James bay and\r\non the border of the prairie regions of the Northwest territories, does\r\nnot extend as far north as York Factory. In ascending Nelson river it\r\nwas not met until within a few miles of lowest Limestone rapid. It\r\nextends northward nearly to the junction of Little Churchill with Great\r\nChurchill river.\r\n\r\n“White Birch:—(‘Canoe Birch’)—This species terminates on Hayes river,\r\na few miles below Steel river. On the Nelson, the first tree was met\r\nwith at seven miles before coming to lowest Limestone rapid, or at\r\nseventy from Point of Marsh. In descending the Little Churchill it\r\ndisappeared about midway between Recluse lakes and the mouth, and in\r\nascending the Great Churchill, it disappeared at eighteen miles above\r\nthe forks. Along Burntwood river and the upper part of the Nelson it is\r\nlarge enough for building canoes, but becomes better for this purpose to\r\nthe northwestward, and it is said to be of very good quality around Lake\r\nAthabaska.”\r\n\r\nDoctor Bell states in his 1886 report (See p. 18):—“The timber all\r\n\r\n                         AROUND LAKE ST. JOSEPH\r\n\r\nhas suffered greatly from forest fires at many different times, from\r\nabout a century ago to the present year. Parts of the main shores and\r\nmany of the islands, especially in the neighborhood of the Grand\r\nTraverse, have escaped the fires, and here full-sized timber may be\r\nseen. The second growth woods are of all ages, from seedlings of a year\r\nago, up to trees nearly as large as those of the original forests. As\r\nelsewhere in these latitudes, where the old forests of spruce, tamarack,\r\nbalsam, white birch, etc., have been burnt, they are succeeded by a\r\ngrowth of mixed aspens and white birch, with a sprinkling of spruce, or\r\nelse by one consisting entirely of Banksian pine. In regard to relative\r\nabundance, the trees found around the lake may be mentioned in the\r\nfollowing order:—white and black spruce, tamarack, aspen, white birch,\r\nBanksian pine, rough-barked poplar, balsam, white cedar, pigeon cherry,\r\nrowan and black ash. The ground or mountain maple (_Acer spicatum_),\r\nwhich is interesting as an indicator of climate, is common, and it was\r\ntraced for a long distance down the Albany. Of the above kinds of\r\ntimber, the white spruce and the tamarack are the most important\r\ncommercially. The cedar is confined chiefly to the immediate shores of\r\nthe lake, where it often forms a continuous but narrow border. About\r\ntwenty spruce logs, for sawing into boards, were lying at Osnaburgh\r\nHouse at the time of our visit. They would average eighteen or twenty\r\ninches in diameter at the butts, the largest being about two feet. The\r\nsix largest showed the following number of rings of growth:—one hundred\r\nand thirteen, ninety-seven, one hundred and twenty-one, one hundred and\r\nsixteen, one hundred and seven, and one hundred and twenty, or an\r\naverage of one hundred and twelve, these rings indicating, it is\r\nsupposed, a corresponding number of years. A new tamarack flag-staff,\r\nwhich was about to be erected, measured about eighteen inches in\r\ndiameter at the butt and showed two hundred and forty-four rings of\r\ngrowth.”\r\n\r\nDoctor Bell reports that on the dry ground along Boulder river the\r\ntimber consists of black spruce, tamarack, balsam, aspen and white\r\nbirch, but on the wet, level tracts, it was principally black spruce.\r\nAll the rapids in Boulder river were overhung by thick groves of\r\ngood-sized white cedar, and the same tree was met with in groups in some\r\nof the swamps at a distance from the river.\r\n\r\nDoctor Bell, reporting on the country around Lake Lansdowne,\r\nsays:—“Except where forest fires have run, large spruce and tamarack\r\ntrees and some cedars were observed on the islands and on the mainland\r\nnear the lake, and also along the river between it and Nolin island.”\r\n\r\nDoctor Bell writes in his report that\r\n\r\n                        ALONG THE ATTAWAPISKAT,\r\n\r\n“except where the timber has been destroyed by fire, there is a good\r\ngrowth of spruce, tamarack, balsam, poplar and white birch, but it does\r\nnot extend far back, the country generally being open sphagnum swamps\r\nwith small scattered tamarack and black spruce trees.”\r\n\r\nDoctor Bell, at one of his examinations before the Senate committee of\r\n1887, produced as an exhibit a branch of the Banksian pine (_Pinus\r\nBanksiana_), often called the jackpine and scrub pine. This is about the\r\nonly tree in North America which we can call strictly Canadian. Both its\r\nnorthern and southern limits are practically in Canada. It extends\r\nthousands of miles from the southeast in New Brunswick to the northwest,\r\nin a belt, throughout the Dominion.\r\n\r\nIn height this tree grows one hundred feet and upwards. Doctor Bell had\r\nseen them six feet in circumference. The largest trees that he had seen\r\nof this species were on the upper waters of the southern branches of\r\nAlbany river. In general, trees attain their greatest perfection in the\r\ncentre of their geographical distribution. Sometimes they degenerate\r\ninto brush, at the outside edge of the territory in which they grow. As\r\nyou go north, south, east or west, they may become smaller and smaller\r\nuntil they die out, but this is not the case with all kinds of trees.\r\n\r\nThe Banksian pine is not particularly valuable for lumber. It resembles\r\nthe red pine; it has a coarse, distinct grain and can be used for many\r\npurposes. In England it would be used for the manufacture of fashionable\r\nbedroom furniture.\r\n\r\nIt is something like the pine of Florida and Georgia, which has been\r\nused for some years past in England in the manufacture of furniture. It\r\nwould\r\n\r\n                     BECOME AN ARTICLE OF COMMERCE\r\n\r\nif means of communication with the northern forests were provided. The\r\nBanksian pine would make good ties, telegraph poles, and timber for\r\ngeneral purposes, besides fuel. In groves it grows very straight, but it\r\nis more likely to be branchy than red pine. Doctor Bell had seen\r\nhundreds of them in groves, affording logs of from twenty to twenty-two\r\ninches in diameter—two or three logs to a tree. It grows very rapidly.\r\nHe had seen it, in his own experience, within fifteen years, growing to\r\nbe useful trees; whole tracts had been covered with good timber.\r\n\r\nAsked while giving evidence before the Senate committee of 1887 whether\r\nthe shores of James bay and Hudson bay are wooded, Doctor Bell explained\r\nthat on the west side to Seal river, a little beyond Churchill,\r\ncommercial timber could be obtained from all the rivers flowing in from\r\nthe south, and jackpine from some, and spruce and tamarack from all the\r\nrivers of James bay. This would be all of merchantable size, not\r\nextraordinarily large, but plenty of it. The spruce might be described\r\nas generally of a small size, but making up in quantity in the number of\r\nlogs that might be obtained. The tamarack, though, is large.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his 1886 report (See p. 18) Mr. A. P. Low of the\r\nGeological Survey states:—“The trees around Favourable lake consist of\r\nwhite and black spruce, aspen and balsam poplar, white birch, balsam and\r\ntamarack, many of which exceed eighteen inches in diameter.” On the\r\nshores of Sandy lake Mr. Low saw many trees of white spruce, poplar,\r\nbirch and balsam exceeding eighteen inches in diameter. Between this\r\nlake and Severn lake there is a considerable area supporting a growth of\r\nblack and white spruce, tamarack, poplar and birch, slightly smaller\r\nthan those seen around the lakes.\r\n\r\nAs Severn river descends towards Favourable lake “the surrounding\r\ncountry gradually becomes smoother and the timber larger until within\r\nthree miles of the lake, when the stream passes through low, swampy\r\nland, covered with thick, wet moss and a small growth of black spruce\r\nand tamarack.”\r\n\r\nMr. Low reports the soil about Deer lake as being “very thin and the\r\ntimber correspondingly poor, except on a few low points where some white\r\nspruce, balsam and poplar exceed fifteen inches in diameter.”\r\n\r\nMr. Low (at the time Director of the Geological Survey), in his evidence\r\nbefore the Senate committee of 1907, as to the resources of the more\r\nsouthern sections of Keewatin which he had explored, namely, between\r\nNorway House and Hudson bay, stated that the forest, as in a great many\r\nother parts of Canada, had been largely destroyed by fire, but around\r\nsome of the large lakes and on the islands and other places,\r\n\r\n                        A FAIR GROWTH OF TIMBER\r\n\r\nis found in that region, with white and black spruce, pine, aspen,\r\npoplar and white birch of eighteen inches diameter. The trees are fairly\r\nclean, and a great many of them would probably make two or three logs,\r\nso that what remains of the timber there is fairly decent and good,\r\nexcept on the low swampy land where the growth is confined to black\r\nspruce and tamarack of no great size. Throughout the more southern\r\nregion described by Mr. Low, there is a good deal of wood that could be\r\nused in the manufacture of pulp.\r\n\r\nAll of the rivers in the region have waterpowers.\r\n\r\nMr. J. B. Tyrrell, in the report of his explorations in the southern\r\npart of this region in 1896 (See p. 20), wrote:—“The surface is\r\ngenerally forested, though most of the valuable timber has been\r\ndestroyed by fire. On Grass, Muhigan and Minago rivers, as well as on\r\nthe shores and islands of some of the lakes, there are still some\r\nforests of excellent white spruce, but on the northern part of Burntwood\r\nriver white spruce is rather scarce, and at Nelson House timber for\r\nhouse logs has to be collected from scattered groves and brought several\r\nmiles up or down the brooks or across the lake. Black spruce and canoe\r\nbirch grow on the more level and imperfectly drained tracts, and\r\nBanskian pine may be seen here and there on the drier hillsides. Canoe\r\nbirch grows to a good size beside the lakes and streams, but aspen\r\n(_Populus tremuloides_) is the commonest deciduous tree, as it grows on\r\nthe drier uplands everywhere,\r\n\r\n                OCCASIONALLY FORMING BEAUTIFUL FORESTS,\r\n\r\nbut more often, and especially towards the north, partly covering the\r\nsurface with scattered groves of small trees. Among the smaller trees or\r\nshrubs, the rowan tree (_Pyrus Americana_) may be mentioned as growing\r\nfreely and having an abundant crop of berries along the face of the\r\nlimestone escarpment, especially around Wekusko and Reed lakes, and the\r\nwild cherry (_Prunus Virginiana_) grows beside most of the lakes.\r\n\r\n“The forests surrounding Reed lake are mostly of poplar, but there are\r\nsome good groves of fine large spruce up to twenty-five inches in\r\ndiameter.”\r\n\r\nMr. Tyrrell states that on the southeastern shore of Athapapuskow lake\r\n“considerable areas are covered with large white spruce.” Almost all the\r\ncountry surrounding Cranberry lakes has been swept by fire, but many of\r\nthe islands are still wooded with white spruce of fair size. At\r\nWintering lake, “the surrounding shores rise gently from the water, and\r\nare densely wooded with a close forest of white spruce, growing on the\r\nrich clay soil.”\r\n\r\nMr. Tyrrell describes finding the site of an old fur station near\r\nSetting lake “completely overgrown with large spruce trees, quite\r\nindistinguishable from those of the surrounding forest.” He adds:—“In\r\nmany other instances the sites of the ancient fur-trading posts could be\r\nrecognized as small, usually rectangular, poplar-covered areas, in the\r\nmidst of or on the border of the adjoining forest.”\r\n\r\nMr. Tyrrell reports the banks of the south branch of Gunisao river,\r\nwhich flows into the northeast side of Lake Winnipeg, as being “wooded\r\nwith beautiful tall white spruce, apparently forming\r\n\r\n                    A MAGNIFICENT CONIFEROUS FOREST\r\n\r\nbut how far back from the river this forest extends was not determined.\r\nThere is certainly here a large quantity of valuable timber, much more\r\nthan was seen anywhere else in the country immediately east of Lake\r\nWinnipeg.” Spruce up to twenty-four inches in diameter was noted.\r\n\r\nIn the report of his explorations in 1899 Mr. D. B. Dowling of the\r\nGeological Survey states:—“In the southern part of the district, north\r\nof Lake Winnipeg, spruce of both the white and black species is found of\r\nfair diameter, but in going north the size materially decreases. Over\r\nthe major portion of the rocky country Banksian pine is the principal\r\ntree, which, though not large enough in general for timber, might in the\r\nfuture be of use for pulp wood.\r\n\r\n“The hilly country to the south of Sisipuk lake and northwest of Loon\r\nlake is not well timbered but the lower land between the two and on the\r\nislands is fairly well covered by groves of small spruce.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dowling, in his report of 1901 on Ekwan district (See p. 21),\r\nstates:— “The timber along the coast gradually becomes smaller as we go\r\nnorthward and the tree-line recedes from the shore, leaving it finally\r\nat the Opinnagow so that the country behind that cape is more or less an\r\nopen plain. The shore, where the trees are at a distance from the beach,\r\nis generally an even mud slope, covered above high tide with grass,\r\nfollowed by a wide belt of stunted willows (gray) which look somewhat\r\nlike the sagebush of the western plains. Behind this, a few isolated\r\nspruces of small stature appear before the tree line is reached. In\r\nsailing along this coast, it is impossible to know which way to steer so\r\nas to run parallel with the land, as nothing can be seen ahead by which\r\nto shape one’s course.”\r\n\r\nAs to the timber in the interior of Ekwan river district, Mr. Dowling\r\nreports:—“Along the streams there is a narrow fringe of timber, but in\r\napproaching the tree-limit this becomes very small. Back from the\r\nimmediate slopes of the rivers the surface is nearly level, and\r\nmoss-covered, with scattered groups of small spruce and tamarack. The\r\ngreater part of the interior is reported to be muskeg (open bog). A\r\nsmall collection of about forty species of shore plants was made at the\r\nmouths of Ekwan and Albany rivers.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Dowling found the surface of the terrace of Ekwan river to be\r\ncovered with a thick coating of moss, and the timber on it is mostly\r\nsmall spruce and tamarack. Some of the trees might be from six to eight\r\ninches in diameter, but the average is much less. At the edges of the\r\nbank a fringe of larger trees occasionally appears, but it does not\r\nextend far from the stream.”\r\n\r\n                      RED LAKE RIVER AND RED LAKE.\r\n\r\nIn his report of his 1893 explorations Mr. Dowling says the timber on\r\nthe banks of Red lake river “is mostly poplar of a fair size with a\r\nsprinkling of birch and black spruce. The birch average twelve inches in\r\ndiameter, but only a few of the spruce trees were found over eighteen\r\ninches.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dowling says the forest about Red lake “is somewhat varied, spruce\r\nand Banksian pine alternating as the dominant trees. On all the dry and\r\nsandy ground a thick growth of slender Banksian pine is found, and no\r\ntrees of large size are apparently to be seen in such areas, but in the\r\nvalleys and near the lakes black spruce is occasionally met with,\r\nforming small groves scattered through the forests of deciduous trees.\r\nIndividual trees of larger size are common on the islands and points\r\nover which forest fires have not run, and such trees may attain in some\r\ninstances a diameter of twenty inches, but the average is under eighteen\r\ninches. Birch and poplar are almost always present wherever the soil\r\nadmits. On the richer and lower ground, between Red lake and Gull Rock\r\nlake, and farther down the river, the poplar trees are well grown and\r\nappear in groves in which nearly all trees average eighteen inches in\r\ndiameter near the base. Farther to the westward on the higher ground,\r\nthe soil being sandy, the Banksian pine is more abundant, and near the\r\nwestern end of Pipestone bay, some trees of red pine form a small grove,\r\nwhich appears to be the northern limit of the species in this basin.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dowling says the trees near Trout lake river are mostly poplar, with\r\nslender spruce on the lower land just behind. Occasionally Banksian pine\r\nis seen on the drier parts. Mr. Dowling mentions a tall forest of poplar\r\nand birch as bordering the western branch of White-mud river.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the country explored by him about Lac Seul, Mr. Dowling\r\nsays:—“The country is well covered by timber but of small average\r\ngrowth. The sandy tracts are generally wooded by Banksian pine, but in\r\nthe river-valleys and on the heavier land, poplar, birch and spruce are\r\nabundant. White and red pine are found in small groves south of Lac Seul\r\nand are of good average size for timber. On the lake are scattered trees\r\nof both varieties. The northern limit of red pine extends to Red lake,\r\nwhere a few trees were observed. Cedar of inferior growth occurs in\r\nisolated localities and extends northwest to the height-of-land, but\r\nnone seem within Berens river basin.”\r\n\r\n               BASINS OF THE WINISK AND THE ATTAWAPISKAT.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. McInnes’s report of his survey of the region drained by\r\nthe Winisk and the Attawapiskat in 1903, 1904 and 1905 (See p.\r\n23):—“The average size of the trees growing within the country explored\r\nis not great. On exceptionally favourable tracts the spruces attain\r\nsizes quite large enough for commercial use as sawn lumber, and large\r\nareas would afford good pulpwood. Evidences of the constant recurrence\r\nof forest fires over the area are everywhere plainly seen. The brulé\r\nareas, varying from quite small patches to large tracts, are of every\r\nage; some are so old the forest has attained the full height of the old\r\ngrowth and the newer age of the trees can only be ascertained by a\r\nreference to their rings of growth, and others so recent that no\r\nvegetation covers the blackened surface. These fires are generally the\r\nresult of the carelessness of Indian travellers, but may sometimes be\r\ntraced to the igniting of a dry, standing tree-trunk by lightning. The\r\noldest trees found in the whole area were growing on a till-covered\r\nisland, about fifty miles from the mouth of Winisk river. The complete\r\nisolation from the mainland by broad channels ensured its protection\r\nfrom fires having their origin outside its own borders. The spruces\r\ngrowing here were found by their rings of growth to be between two\r\nhundred and seventy and two hundred and eighty years old. The diameters\r\nand ages of trees, growing in a number of different localities\r\nthroughout the region, were noted, and are given in the list below:—\r\n\r\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n                                                            Diam.

(E. J. C.)\r\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\nAs to the region explored by him in 1906 (See p. 23), Mr. McInnes\r\nreports:—“Though a wooded country throughout, there are but limited\r\nareas where the forest growth is of a size to be commercially of much\r\nvalue. There are no hard woods, the only deciduous trees that attain\r\nmerchantable measurements being the canoe birch, the aspen and balsam\r\npoplars and the tamarack. Black spruce is the most abundant coniferous\r\ntree and grows to a size sufficient at least for pulpwood. Associated\r\nwith tamarack, it covers all the more marshy tracts, giving way where\r\nthe land becomes drier to white spruce, which is the timber tree of the\r\nregion, and on the driest ridges to Banksian pine. Forest fires have\r\nbeen widespread and most destructive throughout the whole region sparing\r\nonly the very wet muskeg areas and a few tracts isolated by surrounding\r\nwater or marsh.\r\n\r\n“White and black spruce, tamarack, aspen, balsam and canoe birch form\r\nthe forest surrounding Cross lake, the deciduous trees for the most part\r\ngrowing only in a fringe along the immediate shores.\r\n\r\n                   TREES OF SUITABLE SIZE FOR SAWING\r\n\r\ninto eight and ten inch boards are found on the islands, along the\r\nstream valleys and in places near the lake shores, but the general\r\naverage size of the trees inland is smaller than this.”\r\n\r\nMr. McInnes has the following to say of the timber he noticed in his\r\nascent of Burntwood river:—“Above Odei river the forest is mainly\r\nspruce and tamarack of about sixty years growth, the larger trunks\r\nreaching diameters of from eight to ten inches, but the general average\r\nnot more than six inches. In the valleys occasional white spruces and\r\ntamaracks attain diameters as great as eighteen inches. These are trees\r\nthat have escaped when the surrounding forest was burned and are\r\nsufficient evidence that, but for the repeated fires, there would be\r\nlarge areas covered with good timber. In the fifteen mile stretch of the\r\nBurntwood below Waskwatim lake, the low flat along the river is covered\r\nby sixty years’ timber growth, mainly of Banksian pine and spruce. The\r\nhigher plateau is wooded principally with spruce from six to eight\r\ninches in diameter, with scattered Banksian pine, poplar and white birch\r\nsucceeding an earlier burned forest. A mixed second growth forest,\r\nmainly aspen poplar, covers all the uplands round Waskwatim lake, while\r\non the islands and on low flats bordering bays of the lake are found\r\nwhite spruce and poplar of diameters up to one foot. The country north\r\nof Footprint lake is described by Mr. McInnes as being covered for the\r\nmost part with a mixed second growth from ten to thirty years old, but\r\nwith here and there clumps of white spruce, with tall and straight\r\ntrunks a foot or more in diameter. As to the region just north of the\r\nSaskatchewan, Mr. McInnes says the areas of forest, where the trunks are\r\nlarge enough to be of commercial value, are limited. The principal\r\ntracts of large standing timber are situated to the north of Moose lake,\r\nto the west of Atikameg, in lower Grass river valley and on the ridge\r\nseparating Cormorant and Yawningstone lakes. The last named tract\r\ncontains white spruce of exceptionally large size with tall clear\r\ntrunks. Smaller areas are found on islands and points in the various\r\nlakes, along the upper valley of Cowan river, and in clumps along all\r\nthe stream valleys in the district. Smaller timber, mainly black spruce,\r\nthat would be of value for pulpwood, is much more widely distributed\r\nover large areas.”\r\n\r\nMr. McInnes made a computation of the age of the trees in the area he\r\nexplored and found that the\r\n\r\n                         ANNUAL GROWTH IS SLOW.\r\n\r\nThey run from four to fourteen inches in diameter. They would furnish,\r\nhe thinks, very strong and firm lumber, and the smaller trees, owing to\r\ntheir closely packed fibres and the comparative absence of open cellular\r\nmatter, would be especially well adapted for the manufacture of pulpwood\r\nfor paper making.\r\n\r\nMr. McInnes, in his evidence before the Senate committee of 1907, stated\r\nthat the western part of Keewatin has evidently been a country of good\r\ntimber generally, but unfortunately it has been almost all burned over,\r\nso that the only areas of good timber that he knew of were the area\r\nnorth of Moose lake, the area west of Clearwater lake, and the area\r\nbetween Cormorant and Yawningstone lakes. He made cross-sections in that\r\ncountry several times, and he found white spruce, and the largest tree\r\nhe found was thirty inches in diameter. He would say most of these trees\r\nmake about three fourteen-foot logs because they were growing thickly,\r\nand it was a regular white spruce timber limit. There were a great many\r\nfrom ten inches up to twenty-three inches. That is an area about six\r\nmiles long by two or three wide, and going through that there are areas\r\nof swamp. He cross-sectioned through it, and would come to a quarter of\r\na mile of good trees, and then perhaps a mile of swamp land with black\r\nspruce, and half a mile of good trees right across. North of that point\r\nthere are only a few isolated areas of timber that had escaped the fire.\r\nOn the islands and lakes there were pretty good timbers, and on some\r\nlittle peninsulas that are nearly cut off; otherwise it had all been\r\nburnt.\r\n\r\n                           ABOUT WATERPOWERS.\r\n\r\nSpecially referring to waterpowers, Mr. McInnes, in the report of his\r\nexplorations in 1906 (See p. 23), says:—“Between Lake Winnipeg and\r\nSplit lake, a distance of about two hundred and twenty-five miles, the\r\nNelson river has a descent of approximately two hundred and seventy-five\r\nfeet. The current between the numerous lake expansions is generally\r\nswift, and upwards of a dozen falls and rapids occur, some of the former\r\noffering magnificent sites for water powers. The aggregate power that\r\ncould be generated along the river is enormous, as the amount of water\r\npassing over the various falls is very great. The volume of the river\r\ncan be appreciated by a consideration of the extent of its drainage\r\narea, which embraces all the country westward to the mountains between\r\nthe watershed of the Churchill and Athabaska on the north, and the\r\nMissouri on the south, and eastward to the head waters of Albany river,\r\nand within fifty miles of Lake Superior.”\r\n\r\nMr. Owen O’Sullivan, in his 1906 report (See p. 23), states that the\r\nshores of Assean lake, which is about twelve miles long and a mile wide,\r\nare “well wooded with black spruce, tamarack, and white birch.” The\r\nforest growth at Waskaiowaka lake is chiefly black spruce and white\r\nbirch of from four to fourteen inches in diameter. Mr. O’Sullivan\r\ndescribes a hill of drift “covered mostly with black spruce averaging\r\neight inches in diameter” as rising for two hundred feet above the level\r\nof the water on the east side of the expansion of the Little Churchill\r\nbelow Waskaiowaka lake. As far down as the junction of Switching river\r\nthe country on both sides of the Little Churchill produces black spruce,\r\nwhite birch and tamarack of small size. From a point eighty miles down\r\nthe Little Churchill northward, the country, which was overrun by a fire\r\nthat occurred some forty years ago, is now partly covered with bunches\r\nof second-growth black spruce, tamarack and white birch. Bunches of\r\nspruce and tamarack that escaped the fires were frequently met close to\r\nthe water’s edge.\r\n\r\nIn his evidence before the Senate committee of 1907, Mr. O’Sullivan\r\nstated that in his trip in 1906, the only timber he saw was at Split\r\nlake—spruce, poplar and white birch, from four to eighteen inches in\r\ndiameter. The country between there and Big lake is swampy and bears\r\nblack spruce with small spruce averaging four to six inches in diameter,\r\nwhich would make good pulpwood. Then around Wabishkok there are birch\r\nand white spruce, and so on. They are a little larger, as large as six\r\nto eighteen inches in some places, occurring in isolated groves. The\r\nblack spruce would average in the nice terraces and level clay slopes\r\nfrom the lake about eighteen inches. They grow that size and more. North\r\nof that, between there and the tree limit or the open barren ground, the\r\ncountry was\r\n\r\n                            RUN OVER BY FIRE\r\n\r\nabout forty years ago, and probably there was another fire which\r\noccurred about five years ago, so there are no trees. Going down the\r\nLittle Churchill there are no trees to be seen on the heights, except in\r\nthe valleys of the river, where groves of spruce and poplar which\r\nescaped the fire are standing. These spruce and poplars which are in the\r\nvalleys are sometimes twenty inches in diameter. The cottonwood grows to\r\nabout fourteen inches. It is tall and very healthy looking. The spruce\r\ntrees grow pretty long, and quite a number of sawlogs could be taken out\r\nof each tree. The soil is pretty good, but the area is small. After\r\nleaving Big lake, all the way down there is no timber at all. In the\r\nvalleys of all the streams there is timber, consisting of bunches of\r\nspruce and tamarack. At the Big Churchill the clay hills are mostly\r\ncovered with moss. It has been burned over, and there are good large\r\nspruce in the valleys of Little Churchill river away up to about\r\neighteen or twenty inches in diameter, but they are very few. They are\r\nall very healthy looking trees.\r\n\r\nIn 1902, Mr. Alfred W. G. Wilson, of the Geological Survey, made a\r\nreconnaissance traverse across the southern part of the unexplored area\r\nlying to the north of Lac Seul and east of Trout lake, visiting Slate,\r\nMarsh, Gull, Smoothbrook, Cat and St. Joseph lakes. He states in his\r\nreport:—“The forest growth is found chiefly around the lakes and\r\nstreams. The sands, sandy gravels, or clays, usually of glacial origin,\r\nare generally forested, the trees varying with the character of the\r\nsoil. There are large areas of nearly bare rock, where only a few\r\nstunted conifers or poplars grow in the crevices. Where the soil is\r\nsparse, and the country low-lying but yet fairly well drained, there is\r\nan open forest, chiefly black spruce, and the ground is covered with a\r\ndense mat of moss interlaced with fibrous roots. The soil covered, and\r\nthe swampy areas, are usually thickly overgrown with small shrubs,\r\nmostly alder. In general the timber is rather small, in most parts of\r\nthe district at present too small even for pulpwood or ties.\r\nOccasionally along streams the trees are larger, especially north of the\r\neast end of Lac Seul. Another area of good timber, chiefly black spruce\r\nand tamarack, occurs along Root river between Lac Seul and Lake St.\r\nJoseph.”\r\n\r\nMr. J. W. McLaggan, in the account of his trip in 1907 (See p. 58),\r\ndescribes the country between The Pas and Clearwater lake as covered\r\nwith small, mixed timber. On the north side of Cormorant lake, and along\r\nthe creek which connects it with Lake Yawningstone, and on the south\r\nside of the latter lake, he saw from three to five million feet of good\r\nmilling spruce timber. Along Cowan river the country is described as low\r\nand flat, with small quantities of good spruce timber in spots until\r\nwithin a few miles of Black Duck lake when bunches of good spruce,\r\nestimated at ten million feet, come into view. After crossing Black Duck\r\nlake the country continues low and marshy, with scattered bunches of\r\nspruce and tamarack of a size suitable for ties or pulpwood. As Mr.\r\nMcLaggan approached Reed lake he passed through low and swampy country\r\ncovered with scrubby timber. To the south of Reed lake about a million\r\nfeet of medium sized spruce were sighted. The country back was found to\r\nhave been burned over and now growing poplar, which, in a few years,\r\nwill make good pulpwood. On the north side of Herb lake there are spruce\r\nand poplar fit for railway ties and pulpwood, and along the river to the\r\nrapids there are small bunches of jackpine and tamarack and of\r\nmerchantable spruce, but back from the lake and river the country\r\nappeared all burned. Mr. McLaggan expresses the opinion that there must\r\nhave been a good timber area bordering these waters, and that, if fire\r\ncan be kept out,\r\n\r\n                  REFORESTATION WILL SOON BE EFFECTED.\r\n\r\nAlong the shores of and on the islands in Setting lake there is, Mr.\r\nMcLaggan estimates, about ten million feet of young, sound, clear spruce\r\ntimber, averaging from twelve to fourteen inches in diameter. Between\r\nSetting and Paint lakes are two falls of thirty feet, where splendid\r\npower can be developed; the banks of the river become higher and there\r\nare small bunches of spruce and poplar, but back from the river has been\r\nburned over. On the south side of Paint lake there is a fairly good\r\nbunch of spruce, suitable for railway ties or pulpwood. Back from the\r\nlake the country has been burned over but is growing up again with\r\npoplar and other trees. On Methye lake Mr. McLaggan found the timber to\r\nbe mainly jackpine and tamarack of small size, a limited portion of\r\nwhich would be fit for railway ties. Traversing File river, with the\r\nexception of a bunch of spruce of about half a million feet, averaging\r\ntwelve to fourteen inches in diameter, there was seen nothing but small,\r\nscrubby mixed timber of but little value. The country back from the\r\nriver has been burned over. Between Reed lake and Elbow lake he saw\r\nabout two million feet of good spruce and poplar, averaging from twelve\r\nto fourteen inches in diameter. Towards the lower end of Cranberry lake\r\nthere are bunches of good spruce. It is estimated that there are a\r\nmillion feet in all. The country continues rough and rocky, with patches\r\nof good land and some muskeg. In the country between Cranberry and\r\nAthapapuskow lakes there is a poor growth of scrubby timber. Some small\r\nbunches of spruce were seen along Athapapuskow lake near the portage,\r\nand by Goose river, but the country has all burned over, leaving only\r\nsmall clumps of spruce. Speaking generally of the timber in the area\r\nexplored, Mr. McLaggan reported:—“The fires seem to have burned over\r\nnearly all the country and I was not able to walk far enough into the\r\ninterior to find any land not burned, and from information gathered from\r\nIndians and trappers, would conclude that this burned land reached from\r\nGrass to Burntwood river, with the exception of small pieces along the\r\nlakes and rivers. There is a growth of young timber coming up, since the\r\nfire, which may be of value in time.”\r\n\r\nW. Thibaudeau, C.E. (See p. 23), states in his report that although\r\nthere is no merchantable timber in the vicinity of Churchill, there is\r\nabundance of fine building stone and limestone to be found everywhere,\r\nand there is also an ample supply of timber for fuel purposes for many\r\nyears along both banks of Churchill river and around Button bay. He\r\ncontinues:—“Between October 24, 1906, and November 9, 1906, I made an\r\nexploration of the country between North river and Churchill river for a\r\ndistance south of Button bay, of about twenty miles. On the\r\n\r\n                        EAST SIDE OF BUTTON BAY\r\n\r\nI found a strip of good timber, consisting of spruce and tamarack six to\r\nten inches in diameter, about half a mile wide and extending three to\r\nfour miles in length on the east side, between the southern ridge of\r\nChurchill peninsula and the bay, and about three miles south of\r\nChurchill. At the head of Button bay (and parallel with it), there are a\r\nnumber of parallel ridges extending to North river. These ridges are\r\ntimbered with spruce and tamarack four to ten inches in diameter. Close\r\nto North river there is a good spruce timber ten to thirty inches in\r\ndiameter in small scattered bunches, covering a distance of about four\r\nmiles. At the southern end of the south ridge of the western peninsula\r\nat Churchill, there is a strip of good spruce timber, six to twelve\r\ninches in diameter, extending about two miles by four miles; also on the\r\neast side of the same ridge about one and one-third miles south of\r\nMosquito point, there is a strip of good timber for a distance of about\r\nfour miles.\r\n\r\n“Between December 7, 1906, and December 17, 1906, I made an exploration\r\nof the country between Churchill and Owl rivers. Four miles from\r\nChurchill river in a southerly direction I crossed a ridge, running in a\r\nnortheast and southwest direction at about one and one-half miles from\r\nHudson bay, extending opposite to Mosquito point. From the point of\r\ncrossing to the bay, on the sunny side, the ridge is well timbered with\r\nspruce six to twelve inches in diameter. Twenty-five miles from the\r\nstarting point, I crossed another sandy ridge with scrubby timber. Two\r\nmiles west of this point there is a barren hill known as White mountain,\r\nthree hundred feet in height by one mile in length. At the eastern woods\r\nthere are a few square miles of spruce and tamarack averaging six to\r\neight inches in diameter. Close to White Whale lake I crossed another\r\ngravel ridge having no timber. On each side of Salmon creek there are\r\nscrubs, willows and small spruce, with grassy meadows. At Broad river to\r\nthe left of the place of crossing, for about four miles there is a strip\r\nof timber one-third of a mile in width, eight to fourteen inches in\r\ndiameter, consisting of stunted black spruce.”\r\n\r\nThe section about Waskaiowaka lake is fairly level and dry, with some\r\nscrub timber. The banks are steep and covered with very thick mossy\r\npeat, probably ten feet thick. The timber consists of black spruce and\r\nwhite birch from five to sixteen inches in diameter. From the Hudson’s\r\nBay Company’s post on Split lake to the mouth of Grass river, the\r\ncountry on the east side of the lake is undulating, and part of the\r\nbanks and islands is fairly timbered with spruce. Part of the shore of\r\nLanding lake and the islands are well timbered with spruce six to ten\r\ninches in diameter. Travelling from Landing lake to the head of Sipiwesk\r\nlake, the country was found dry and well timbered with spruce from eight\r\nto fourteen inches in diameter. The islands of Sipiwesk lake are well\r\ntimbered with spruce, some being thirty inches in diameter. On Reed\r\nlake, the islands are well timbered with spruce six to fourteen inches\r\nin diameter. From Reed lake to Station 616 the country is level, forty\r\nper cent. being swampy. There is some spruce and tamarack timber four to\r\neight inches in diameter. On the north side of Cormorant lake, there is\r\na strip of timber, four miles wide by ten miles long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Log jam on Limestone river.]\r\n\r\n                     THIS TIMBER WAS THE BEST SEEN\r\n\r\nwhile exploring around that country.\r\n\r\nMr. Thibaudeau describes the country from Split lake and extending to\r\nThe Pas, ten miles in width on each side of the proposed route of the\r\nHudson bay railway, as “a pulpwood belt”. He says in his report:—“On\r\nthis area, assuming one-sixth to be covered by pulp wood, the balance\r\nbeing river, lakes, ponds, swamps, etc., and assuming ten cords per acre\r\nof an average of six inches in diameter, there would be five million\r\nseven hundred and fifty-six thousand six hundred and sixty cords. This\r\nis a very low, but safe estimate.”\r\n\r\nMr. Thibaudeau makes the following reference to the water powers in the\r\nregion explored by him:—“Deer river at its mouth has a minimum flow of\r\nseven thousand cubic feet per minute. A dam, eighteen feet high, can be\r\nbuilt at reasonable cost and would generate one thousand six hundred\r\nhorse-power. Two dams of the same height could be built within ten miles\r\nof the river mouth, which is twenty-five miles from Churchill. North\r\nriver, which is three hundred and fifty feet wide during December, had a\r\nflow of not less than two hundred and fifty thousand cubic feet per\r\nminute. With a fifteen-foot dam, it would generate about five thousand\r\nhorse-power. On Churchill river, within sixty to eighty miles from\r\nChurchill, large waterpower could be developed and transmitted to\r\nChurchill. Nelson river, Burntwood river and Grass river have a number\r\nof falls which could be utilized for the development of power for use in\r\npulp mills or other industries.”\r\n\r\nThat portion of Mr. J. R. Dickson’s report (See p. 60) referring to the\r\ntimber of the district between\r\n\r\n                         THE PAS AND CROSS LAKE\r\n\r\nexplored by him in 1910 is especially valuable. He states:—“In the\r\nregion we traversed, only five species, namely,—spruce, poplar,\r\ntamarack, birch and jackpine have any possible commercial value, and of\r\nthese, speaking generally, only one, spruce, is large enough for sawmill\r\npurposes or railway tie material. The poplar, birch and pine are\r\ninvariably too short, spindly, limby and crooked for any use save fuel\r\nor pulpwood, and what mature tamarack there was is now standing dead\r\nfrom insect attack. We did not find over two hundred green tamarack\r\nabove ten inches in diameter all summer. This remnant is on the\r\nnortheast end of Bear island in Sipiwesk lake. Black spruce is easily\r\nthe predominant species in all that region, and, except on very\r\noccasional well-drained tracts of spruce-flat type, where it reaches ten\r\nto fourteen inches in diameter at breast height, it is a small spindly\r\ntree, only four to eight inches diameter breast height at maturity,\r\nuseless even for second class ties. This is the condition in which the\r\njackpine also occurs. The white spruce, therefore, is the only species\r\nlarge enough to furnish construction timber, sawlogs, or even railway\r\nties, and the supply is very limited. In the first place, this species\r\noccurs only on the best drained spots, such as river and lake margins or\r\non the small islands; in the second, the fires of the past one hundred\r\nyears have destroyed nearly all the old stand. To sum up then, only a\r\nmere fraction of one per cent. of the area we surveyed now carries\r\nmerchantable timber—a fringe along lower Mitishto and upper Minago\r\nrivers, and on a few of the islands and peninsulas in the larger\r\nlakes—as shown on the map. There is probably enough timber available to\r\nbuild the rough construction work of the Hudson Bay Railway.\r\n\r\n“From the mere size of the country and the density of the oncoming\r\nsecond growth stands, the possible supply of firewood is enormous.\r\nBecause of its remoteness from settlement, however, it has no present\r\ncommercial value. Owing to the killing by bark beetles of practically\r\nall the larger tamarack (or possibly killed by larch sawfly previous to\r\nbeetle attack, though we found no trace of the sawfly), there is almost\r\nno green pile timber of any value in the whole region. Hence, unless by\r\nimportation, the only choice left is between dead tamarack and the\r\nlargest of the close-grained black spruce. The latter would remain sound\r\nin soil contact for about ten or twelve years, which would\r\nsatisfactorily cover the first initial experimental stage in the\r\noperation of the new road.\r\n\r\n“Just at the present time, within the area we inspected, the timber is\r\ntoo young and small upon the whole to be cut at a profit even for\r\npulpwood. But in the absence of fires for twenty years the now\r\neighty-year-old stands of four to eight-inch timber can be profitably\r\ncut for this purpose, and it is probable that within the next quarter of\r\na century part of the\r\n\r\n                    ENORMOUS ENERGY NOW RUNNING FREE\r\n\r\nin the falls and rapids of Nelson and Grass rivers will be harnessed to\r\ndrive pulp and paper mills. The age of the reproduction is in nearly\r\nevery case a measure of the time which has elapsed since the last\r\ndestructive fire occurred. As a general rule, to which, however, there\r\nare endless local exceptions and variations—the young growth is\r\napproximately either forty or eighty years of age, the former being now\r\none to four inches in diameter, and the latter four to eight inches, but\r\nnone yet large enough for making railway ties. It will, however, soon be\r\nsuitable for pulpwood. Scattered trees from older stands occur in this\r\nsecond growth, but not in sufficient number to repay the cost of\r\nlumbering. The rate of growth in the very dense stands that are usual in\r\nthat latitude is decidedly slow except where the soil and drainage\r\nconditions happen to be just right. Black spruce on semi-muskeg, a site\r\nof average quality for that species, is only four to five inches in\r\ndiameter breast height at one hundred years. White spruce is rather\r\nfastidious regarding moisture conditions and only appears on fairly\r\nwell-drained spots, attaining there a size of eight to twelve inches\r\ndiameter within a century. Poplar in that time reaches eight to ten\r\ninches. As for jackpine, occasional trees reach twelve to sixteen\r\ninches, but only after long immunity from fires, and such trees are too\r\nlimby for use. I saw no jackpine stand where the trees would average\r\neven six inches in diameter. If the general drainage conditions could in\r\nsome way be improved so as to partially replace the unprofitable black\r\nspruce with the white species,\r\n\r\n                THE WEALTH PRODUCING POWER OF THE REGION\r\n\r\nwould be immeasurably greater.”\r\n\r\nMr. William Beech of Churchill, in his communication to the press\r\nreferred to in the preceding chapter (See p. 63), writes of the timber\r\nresources of Hudson bay region:—“Another valuable asset of the district\r\nis the timber which everywhere dots the regions around the bay. The most\r\nnortherly species is the spruce, which extends north of Churchill about\r\nforty miles, as far as Seal river, and which attains the height of about\r\nthirty feet and an average diameter of from twelve to fifteen inches.\r\nThe balance of the timber is pulpwood and this exists in unlimited\r\nquantities. When you consider that the best of water power is available\r\nall along the rivers for the manufacture of this product, it will be\r\nseen that this is but another of the valuable resources of the\r\ndistrict.”\r\n\r\nAs to the water powers available, Mr. Beech writes:—“There are a great\r\nnumber of magnificent water power sites, within very easy access of the\r\nsurveyed route of the railway, all of which can be easily developed to\r\nfurnish almost unlimited electrical energy. Hydro-electric energy could\r\nbe developed at any one of these sites within a distance of thirty miles\r\nfrom the road, which would make transmission to points along it, or\r\npossibly operation of it actually, by electricity. It certainly assures\r\ncheap power for any manufacturing or milling centre which may develop.\r\nAll these power locations must inevitably become very valuable. A few\r\nyears ago, no one, with the exception of one or two far-seeing and\r\nexperienced individuals, believed in the power propositions on Winnipeg\r\nriver where so much development is now taking place. To-day what are\r\nthey worth? They cannot be bought at any price. I believe the same will\r\nbe true of the sites contiguous to the Hudson Bay Railway.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE KEEWATIN AREA.\r\n\r\n                (Newest Ontario and Northern Manitoba.)\r\n\r\n                           Economic Minerals.\r\n\r\n   The Rocks in Many Cases Highly Magnetic.—Norite Rock Similar to\r\n     That at Sudbury About Trout Lake.—Peat in the District North of\r\n     Lake Winnipeg.—A Large District Underlain By Keewatin and\r\n     Huronian Rocks Which “Has Large Possibilities.”—Gypsum.—\r\n     Building Granites.—Quartz Veins on Grassy River Below Reed\r\n     Lake.—A Possibility of Nickel Occurring.\r\n\r\nThe evidence contained in the report of the British parliamentary\r\ninvestigation of 1749 shows that from the establishment of the first\r\ntrading posts along the shores of Hudson bay, the attention of the\r\nofficials and servants of the Hudson’s Bay Company was attracted by the\r\nstatements of the natives as to the existence in the country of deposits\r\nof economic minerals. The earliest authorities of the trading company\r\nappear, however, not only to have abstained from investigating the\r\nmineral resources of the region, but to have discouraged their employees\r\nfrom prospecting, desiring them to concentrate all their efforts upon\r\nthe fur trade. Many of the witnesses before the committee repeated in\r\ntheir evidence statements obtained from the Indians as to the existence\r\nof deposits of lead, and particularly of copper, in the north, doubtless\r\nreferring to the then unknown Coppermine district.\r\n\r\nThe only evidence heard before the committee, unquestionably bearing\r\nupon the mineral resources of the territory immediately under review in\r\nthis chapter, was given by Alexander Browne, who had been six years in\r\nthe company’s service as surgeon at the bay, and who stated that he had\r\nseen large quantities of red earth, which was obtained about thirty-six\r\nmiles to the southward of Churchill river; that he had tried some of it\r\nin a crucible, and found it to contain a heavy metallic substance like\r\ncinnabar, and a fluid like quicksilver. This trial was only to satisfy\r\nhis curiosity, having received no orders to make it; but the\r\n\r\n                GOVERNOR WAS PRESENT AT THE EXPERIMENT,\r\n\r\nand upon the witness presenting his surprise to him that the company did\r\nnot endeavour to improve these discoveries, the Governor answered that\r\nhe was likewise surprised that they did not.\r\n\r\nRev. John Semmens (See p. 36), writing of his observations while on\r\nservice as a missionary in the Burntwood district, says:—“It was not my\r\nbusiness to seek for minerals, but having been a miner in earlier years,\r\nI had my eyes open, and found many indications of deposits which, in my\r\nopinion, at no distant day will contribute largely to the commercial\r\ndevelopment of the north. I shall be surprised if one of these lodes is\r\nnot found at or near the southern outlet of Beaver Dam lake. And there\r\nwill be many others.”\r\n\r\nDoctor Robert Bell, of the Geological Survey, describes the rocks of the\r\neastern part of Lake St. Joseph as “corresponding with some of those of\r\nthe Huronian series. On the northern side, three miles from Osnaburgh\r\nHouse, there is a grey mica schist.” On the Albany, two and a half miles\r\nbelow Shabushquaia river, “Huronian rocks make their appearance. They\r\nconsist of light-greenish, rather finely crystalline hornblende schist;\r\nblack, with some light-coloured schist, together with fifteen or twenty\r\nfeet of fine-grained banded magnetic iron ore, with slaty partings. A\r\nspecimen of this ore was analysed by Mr. Kenrick of the Geological\r\nSurvey, and found to contain 42·09 per cent. of metallic iron, and to be\r\nfree from titanic acid. Along with the magnetite is a band of iron\r\npyrites, a few inches thick, with traces of copper.” A dark green\r\nhornblende schist occurs at two miles before coming to Shabushquaia\r\nriver. It holds patches of calc-spar and quartz running with the\r\ncleavage. Specks of copper pyrites were found in small quartz veins in\r\nthe schist at the foot of the falls at the eighth portage below Lake St.\r\nJoseph on the Albany. At the eleventh portage Doctor Bell examined a\r\nnumber of veins of quartz holding epidote and hornblende, but no ores\r\ncould be detected.\r\n\r\nDoctor Bell, before the Senate committee of 1887, referring to his first\r\nvoyage to Hudson bay, explained that lignite had been found inland in\r\nthe country south and west of James bay. It belongs to a more recent\r\ngeological formation than the lignite in the vicinity of Edmonton.\r\n\r\nMr. A. P. Low, in his report of his examination of the country between\r\nLake Winnipeg and Hudson bay, says “The rocks in several places\r\n\r\n                          ARE HIGHLY MAGNETIC,\r\n\r\nand probably contain large quantities of iron ore, both disseminated in\r\nsmall crystals through the rock, and in large masses.” When being\r\nexamined before the Senate committee in 1907, Mr. Low, then Director of\r\nthe Geological Survey of Canada, drew attention to the fact that the map\r\nof Keewatin showed a large number of lakes, like Gas lake, Island lake,\r\nFavourable lake, Severn lake, Trout lake, etc., and remarked that\r\nwherever these patches of water are seen it indicates softer rocks than\r\nthe other parts. These rocks are usually Huronian, and in many places\r\nthey carry good indications of minerals, copper pyrites and different\r\nsulphides of that kind. At Trout lake there is a large area of what is\r\ncalled norite rock. These are the rocks in which the nickel deposits of\r\nSudbury occur, and there is great probability of a small deposit being\r\nfound up there.\r\n\r\nThere have been no indications of coal discovered in Keewatin, but Mr.\r\nLow explained that on hurried trips such as he had made it was\r\nimpossible to examine mineral deposits very much, and one is liable to\r\nlose many of them. The general character of the southern part of\r\nKeewatin as regards mineral resources is good.\r\n\r\nIn the bank of Nelson river, opposite the mouth of Pine creek, Mr. J. B.\r\nTyrrell reports a dark grey, rather fine-grained diorite or uralitic\r\ndiabase, probably forming part of a large dyke cutting the gneiss. “Near\r\nthe north end of Little Playgreen lake is a light reddish-grey massive\r\nbiotite-granite cut by veins, a foot or more in width, of red pegmatite\r\ncontaining crystalline masses of molybdenite, with occasional crystals\r\nof pyrite and magnetite.”\r\n\r\nMr. Tyrrell reports copper and arsenical pyrites in a diabase dyke\r\nexposed in an island in Pipestone lake two miles and a quarter from the\r\nmouth of the river.\r\n\r\nHe reports the cliffs on the lower part of Burntwood river as being\r\n“occasionally overlain by a small thickness of peat.” He reports other\r\ndeposits of peat in the district north of Lake Winnipeg.\r\n\r\nBefore the Senate committee of 1907, Mr. Tyrrell explained that the\r\nprimary object in all his explorations was the mineral development of\r\nthe country, and any other information that he collected was incidental.\r\nHe stated that there is a district from Cumberland House northeastward\r\ntowards Nelson river which is underlain by what are known as\r\n\r\n                      KEEWATIN AND HURONIAN ROCKS,\r\n\r\nthe same kind as those in which minerals are found in northern Ontario\r\nat the present time. The very existence of those rocks was barely known.\r\nThere had been practically no exploration of them, no prospecting, so\r\nthat no one could say as to whether they were to be a barren portion of\r\nthose rocks which are rich elsewhere, or whether they were to be like\r\nthe Huronian and Keewatin rocks elsewhere, rich in mineral of some of\r\nthe kinds so much desired. Comparing them with the rocks in other\r\nplaces, they have large possibilities. From that point there is an area\r\nof sandstone in the vicinity of Cree lake which may contain copper, but\r\nnothing much was known of it. It is about the age and character of the\r\nrocks that are rich in copper around Lake Superior, but no mineral\r\nwealth has yet been found in it.\r\n\r\nMr. D. B. Dowling, in his report on the survey of Burntwood-Nelson-Lake\r\nWinnipeg district in 1899, predicts that the several large areas of\r\nHuronian rocks which he outlines will at some future time be thoroughly\r\nprospected, and, as has been the case in nearly all such areas, ores of\r\nthe useful and precious metals are likely to be found. “As it is at\r\npresent, a very hasty visit has shown that many quartz veins and\r\nintrusive dykes cut these rocks, and indications of the precious metals\r\nare not wanting. In the Pipestone area on Nelson river, mispickel and\r\ncopper pyrites are recorded by Mr. Tyrrell, as well as a promising\r\nshowing of mica on the south side of Indian Reserve island, on Cross\r\nlake.”\r\n\r\nIn Severn district, in the southern part of the old district of Keewatin\r\n(now part of Ontario), there is a large region lying to the southwest of\r\nCape Henrietta Maria, that had never been geographically explored before\r\n1901. In the year named, Mr. Dowling was entrusted to do this work, and\r\nwas instructed to make an instrumental survey of Ekwan river, the\r\nlargest stream in this region. A micrometer survey of the river was made\r\nto the mouth of the Washagami branch, a distance of one hundred and\r\nfifty miles. The general valley was found to be a narrow cut through\r\nclay, with cut banks on either side for most of the distance to the\r\nfirst branch. As directed by his instructions, Mr. Dowling\r\n\r\n                           LOOKED FOR GYPSUM\r\n\r\nbetween Moose Factory and Albany, and found some loose pieces of it in\r\nthe vicinity of Nomansland.\r\n\r\n“It is quite likely that this mineral occurs in situ in the vicinity,”\r\nMr. Dowling states in his report.\r\n\r\nIn another part of his report Mr. Dowling states:—“Silurian limestone\r\nis found on Trout river, draining Mill lake, as well as in the bed of\r\nthis lake just north of the trap rocks. The rocks at the narrows of the\r\nlake, described in the maps, as ‘high and romantic’ are cliffs one\r\nhundred and fifty feet in height of trap, capping horizontal beds of\r\nprobably Animikie age. The trap overflow covers the uneven surface of\r\nthese rocks, in much the same manner as Nipigon bay in Lake Superior.\r\nThe underlying rocks are dark slates impregnated with iron ore, and\r\ninterbanded with beds of jasper. Some of the beds seem to contain a high\r\npercentage of magnetite and hematite. On the east shore a section of\r\nabout ninety feet of these jasper and iron-bearing slates is exposed\r\nabove the lake, but on the west side they have been brought down to\r\nbelow the water level by a series of north and south faults and the\r\nexposures there are of trap alone. These rocks form an east and west\r\nridge reaching to the lakes on the Washagami and eastward to a large\r\nlake on a branch of Trout river, which, as before stated, drains Sutton\r\nMill lake and runs to the north.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dowling reported iron ore in the vicinity of Sutton Mill lake, west\r\nof James bay, and south of Hudson bay. On the east coast of James bay\r\nand Hudson bay abundant evidence of iron ore had been discovered; in\r\nfact, two large islands, Taylor and Gillis islands, are said to be\r\nalmost pure iron ore.\r\n\r\nMr. D. B. Dowling, in his report of 1902 (Part F.F. Geol. Sur. Report)\r\nsays:—“Small deposits of peat are to be found in various places, but\r\nthe most important, from an economic point of view, is the area north of\r\nLake Winnipeg described by Mr. Tyrrell. Along the valley of Burntwood\r\nriver, where it is cut through the thick clay deposit, the general\r\nsurface of the terrace is quite level. The drainage near the river is\r\ngeneral, but back from the edge of the valley, on the more level parts,\r\nthere is very often a wide expanse of swamp covered by a stunted growth\r\nof spruce and carpeted by heavy layers of moss. These swamps may at some\r\nfuture time supply peat for fuel.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the report of Mr. Wm. McInnes, who explored in 1906 (See p.\r\n23) the basins of Reed and Wekusko lakes and Grass river, there are\r\nareas of intrusive granite, some of which, below Reed lake, are of even\r\ntexture and bright red colour and would furnish very beautiful stones\r\nfor monumental work and ornamental building. Palæozoic limestones cover\r\nall the country between the Saskatchewan and an east and west line\r\ncutting the southern ends of Reed and Wekusko lakes. The rocks are, as\r\nfar as examined, magnesian and are probably all dolomites. They occur in\r\nflat-lying or gently undulating beds, varying in thickness from six feet\r\nor more to quite thin and shaly, the latter occurring near the base and\r\nthe heavy beds forming the mass of the formation. Many of the heavy beds\r\nare even-grained and uniformly bedded so that they can be readily taken\r\nout in blocks of even thickness and of any required size. Many of the\r\nlow cliffs near the lakes are so situated as to be admirably adapted for\r\nquarrying. Quartz veins are plentiful throughout the Keewatin belts,\r\nbut, with the exception of arsenical and iron pyrites and traces of\r\ncopper (near File lake), no valuable minerals were found in them, though\r\ntheir character, particularly where exposed on Grassy river below Reed\r\nlake, was\r\n\r\n                      CONSIDERED PROMISING ENOUGH\r\n\r\nfor the occurrence of the minerals that are so often associated with\r\nthese rocks. The prevailing rocks exposed along Nelson river are biotite\r\ngneisses. Only at two places on the shores are other rocks seen, at\r\nPipestone lake and on the southern shores of Cross lake, where a belt of\r\nKeewatin rocks crosses, and for some miles follows the river valley. The\r\nexposures at Cross lake are promising looking for the occurrence of\r\ngold, resembling closely, as they do, the gold bearing strata of the\r\ndistrict east of Lake of the Woods. They are cut by intruded masses of\r\nthe same crushed granite with blue opalescent quartz, known locally in\r\nthe eastern region as _Protogene_.\r\n\r\nMr. William McInnes, in his evidence before the Senate committee of\r\n1907, stated that in the region just west of Hudson bay there are only\r\ntwo or three belts of what is known as the Keewatin rocks. These are the\r\nrocks which in western Ontario hold gold. The witness found no minerals\r\nin commercial quantities. He found traces of copper on File lake. At\r\nCross lake there is an area of these Keewatin rocks cut by intrusive\r\ngranite of the same character as the protogene of western Ontario, which\r\nare almost always gold-bearing, but nothing has been found there. The\r\nlimestones would make excellent building material. There are some\r\nintrusive granites on Grassy river which are of fine texture and\r\nbeautiful red colour, which would make very fine monumental stone\r\ntrimmings for buildings, etc., and would quarry very well. That would be\r\nalong the projected line of the railway.\r\n\r\n                          NICKEL MAY BE FOUND.\r\n\r\nAn occurrence, which seemed to Mr. McInnes to be of particular interest,\r\nwas his discovery on upper Winisk river of a large area of so-called\r\nnorite rock. That is the rock in which the nickel of Sudbury occurs. It\r\nis quite a characteristic rock. Mr. McInnes examined samples under the\r\nmicroscope, and they are not to be distinguished from the Sudbury rock.\r\nThat led him to hope that there was a possibility of nickel occurring\r\nthere too, but he did not find any, although he examined as well as he\r\ncould. But he had not much time, and was too far away. There are two or\r\nthree areas of these Keewatin rocks occurring unfolded in the\r\nLaurentian, but Mr. McInnes found no minerals in economic quantities in\r\nthem at all. Near Eabamet river, a tributary of the Albany, he saw\r\ncrystals of mica in the granite, two and a half inches in diameter. Of\r\ncourse that is not large enough to amount to much, but it shows a\r\npossibility that there might be something better there.\r\n\r\nMr. A. W. G. Wilson says of the district north of Lac Seul explored by\r\nhim (See p. 74):—“There seems to be little prospect of finding valuable\r\neconomic minerals in the region in paying quantities. In almost all the\r\nbands of basic schists small, less often large, veins of quartz occur.\r\nAt the surface these veins and the associated schists present the usual\r\nrusty appearance due to the decomposition of the pyrite. The granites\r\nare occasionally cut by pegmatitic dikes. Near the head of Cross lake, a\r\nrock, apparently of this character, carries a small amount of\r\nmolybdenite in crystals varying in size up to an inch and a half across;\r\nit is uncertain whether the mineral is of economic importance, but the\r\nsmall size and the poor character of the specimen seen, and the\r\ndifficulties of transportation point to the deposit being economically\r\nunworkable. The extent of the vein is not known. Near the inlet into\r\nSlate lake, about three-quarters of a mile from its northeast end, on\r\nthe eastern shore, is the only place where magnetic minerals were found\r\nsufficiently segregated to produce a noticeable local variation of the\r\ncompass. Here, stringers of a metallic mineral, probably magnetite, were\r\nfound. Though this metal is sometimes a constituent of the basic rocks,\r\nthe more common occurrence of iron ore is in the form of ilmenite. No\r\nhematite was noted in the district.”\r\n\r\nIn his report (See p. 60) Mr. J. R. Dickson speaks of the mineral\r\ndeposits of the area explored by his party south of Cross lake as\r\nfollows:—“Judging by such necessarily superficial observations as the\r\nmembers of the party were able to make, the region we covered is not\r\nwell supplied with economic minerals.\r\n\r\n                            TRACES OF COPPER\r\n\r\nwere found at Wekusko lake, and samples of iron ore at Sipiwesk lake,\r\nand careful prospecting might perhaps disclose deposits of commercial\r\nvalue, but everywhere else so far as observed, the obtruding bedrock was\r\neither pure granite or limestone. The latter, however, is mostly\r\ndolomite, the variety used as a flux in the reducing of iron ores, and\r\nfuture ore discoveries may give rise to such demand. This dolomite also\r\nwill prove a valuable building stone for prairie towns, when made\r\navailable by the Hudson Bay Railway.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. McLaggan (See p. 58) the section of country about Reed\r\nlake is very rocky. Dark coloured granite, streaked with white quartz,\r\nextends along the lower end of the lake and for six miles along the\r\nriver. Four miles farther Mr. McLaggan found indications of iron and saw\r\na good water power. Above Herb lake he saw another splendid water power,\r\nvery easy to develop, and along the river below rapids in five places\r\nfrom which fair power could be generated. At the lower end of Herb lake\r\nand along the river, granite mixed with white quartz was seen, and at\r\nthe falls in the river, about twenty miles below the lake, good slate\r\nwas found. On this lake Mr. McLaggan noted indications of iron. In\r\nplaces along and back from Grass river, on either side, quartz was seen.\r\nThe country has been burned over, leaving only a few bunches of spruce,\r\nand the surface of the rock has been well exposed, so that prospecting\r\nwould be easy. Mr. McLaggan thinks that this part of the country may\r\nprove rich in mineral.\r\n\r\nOn September 10, Mr. McLaggan reached Paint lake. Quartz was still in\r\nsight, but not so frequent in occurrence. There are a number of islands\r\nin the lake with rocky shores and small, mixed timber. Below Elbow lake\r\nthe river banks are high, the country becomes rougher, and fire has\r\nbared the rocks of soil. White quartz crops out in considerable\r\nquantities. Along the banks of Cumberland lake there are considerable\r\nquantities of limestone, which may “become very valuable in time.”\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the region explored, as a whole, Mr. McLaggan considered\r\nthat as a mineral country it offers a wide field for prospectors. “In\r\nthe country travelled over there are indications of gold, silver, iron\r\nand limestone, and Indians and white men from the north tell wonderful\r\nstories of a place called Indian lake, north of Nelson House, and of an\r\nisland on Burntwood river where various minerals and oil are said to\r\nexist.”\r\n\r\nIn his report on the preliminary surveys for the Hudson Bay Railway,\r\nJohn Armstrong, C.E., states:—“Our definite knowledge of minerals is\r\nlimited to limestone and marble. The limestone occurs in the southern\r\nportion of the line a short distance from The Pas, in unlimited\r\nquantities favourable for quarrying, and will probably prove the future\r\nsource of supply for the greater part of the provinces of Saskatchewan\r\nand Manitoba. Marble of a very high grade occurs on Marble island in\r\nHudson bay, and is also found of a fair quality at Churchill. Iron ores,\r\ngold, silver, galena, mica and other minerals have been discovered by\r\nthe Geological Survey at various localities on the bay, all of which are\r\nfully described in the reports of that department. Various specimens of\r\nthe precious metals have been shown to our engineers, but their origin\r\nwas preserved in so much mystery that they could not be treated as\r\nevidence of the existence of the metal in that territory, and might have\r\nbeen used with equal effect to demonstrate the richness of a deposit in\r\nColorado or Johannesburg.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE KEEWATIN AREA.\r\n\r\n                (Newest Ontario and Northern Manitoba.)\r\n\r\n                  Game, Fur-bearing Animals and Fish.\r\n\r\n   Flocks of Wild Fowl that Obscure the Sky.—Six Species of Seal in\r\n     Hudson Bay.—Stocked with Animals of Various Kinds.—White Fish\r\n     Abound in Most of the Lakes and Streams.—Saw Eleven Moose in\r\n     One Day.—The Commercial Value of the Sturgeon Fisheries.—\r\n     Future Summer Playgrounds.—Barren Lands Caribou at Churchill.\r\n\r\nThe immense resources of this territory in the matter of fur, fin and\r\nfeather, are traditional, but the testimony of residents and explorers\r\nas to distribution, present conditions, etc., are interesting and\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nDoctor Robert Bell, in his 1886 report (See p. 17), says the Indians\r\naround Lake St. Joseph “live principally upon fish in summer and rabbits\r\nin winter, but these resources are supplemented by geese and ducks in\r\nthe spring and autumn, and occasionally by larger game, such as caribou\r\nand bears at any season. The fishes of the lake comprise whitefish, grey\r\ntrout, sturgeon, pike, pickerel, yellow-barred perch, grey and red\r\nsuckers, besides some smaller species.\r\n\r\n“At seven miles before joining the Attawapiskat, Boulder river falls\r\ninto a lake three miles long, which the Indians call Sturgeon lake, from\r\nthe abundance of this fish to be found in it. While in the act of\r\nsetting our gill net, the evening we camped on its shores, a sturgeon,\r\nmeasuring upwards of five feet in length, was caught in it.”\r\n\r\nDoctor Bell reports that several lakes abounding in fish are said to\r\noccur on the course of Henley river, which flows into the Albany ten\r\nmiles below the Forks.\r\n\r\nDoctor Bell, in his evidence before the Senate committee of 1887, said\r\nhe had seen wild fowl in the region about Hudson bay in large numbers,\r\nand if one were close enough up to them, and surprised them in a marsh,\r\nthey would rise in such clouds that\r\n\r\n                         THEY OBSCURED THE SKY\r\n\r\nfor a few moments until they got away. They would not darken the land in\r\ntheir flight, but they would prevent one seeing the sky or the sun for a\r\nfew seconds. On the shores of Hudson bay and straits are found nearly\r\nall the sea birds that live in the northern part of this continent, and\r\nsome of those of Europe. Some species are abundant; surf ducks, scoters,\r\neider ducks, etc. The eider duck is valuable on account of its down. Of\r\ngeese, the grey goose and the blue and the white wavies are very\r\nabundant in the spring and autumn on the shore of Hudson bay—and\r\nespecially towards the southern parts of James bay. Swans are common.\r\nThey breed on the islands, and some on the shores of Hudson bay, and\r\ntheir skins are an article of trade. In former years swans’ down was\r\nused for trimming ladies’ garments, and swans’ skins formed an item of\r\nexport for the Hudson’s Bay Company. White bears are found in the\r\nnorthern part of Hudson bay, and there are plenty of black bears around\r\nthe southern part.\r\n\r\nThere are valuable fisheries, too. There are codfish in Hudson bay. The\r\nvariety the witness had seen is called the ‘rock cod,’ which is not of\r\nso good a quality as the common variety of the Atlantic, but he\r\nunderstood that it is the same species.\r\n\r\nThe variety of fish known as sea trout is found in the mouths of the\r\nrivers running into Hudson bay and James bay. They do not go far up the\r\nstream; they are never found beyond the first fall in a river. There are\r\nsea trout in both Hudson bay and James bay, at the mouths of the rivers.\r\nThey are the same variety as that found on the Atlantic coast. They have\r\nthe same habits. There is also the speckled trout. The marine\r\nanimals—fishes and mammals of Hudson bay—have precisely the same\r\nhabits as similar species have on the Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\nThe fur seal is not found here, but the seals of Hudson bay are valuable\r\nfor their oil. They are tolerably abundant. There are\r\n\r\n                    SIX SPECIES OF SEAL IN THE BAY.\r\n\r\nThere is the bearded seal, for instance, which grows to the length of\r\nthirteen feet, the ringed seal, the Greenland seal in Hudson strait, the\r\ngrey seal, and the harbour seal, which is quite common in those waters,\r\nalso the spotted or fresh-water seal. The latter run up the rivers after\r\nsalmon and whitefish. It is a large spotted species with an almost white\r\nor light grey coat, with distinct black spots thickly scattered over its\r\nbody. This seal ascends the rivers for long distances inland, sometimes\r\nas much as two hundred miles. They live on fish, and they sometimes\r\nremain in the lakes in the interior. The skins of these seals are\r\nvaluable, making very good coats.\r\n\r\nAs to James bay, the best fish there is a variety of whitefish,\r\napparently identical with the large whitefish of Lake Superior, only the\r\nfish grow larger in the cold waters in the north. The whitefish live\r\nequally well, if not better, in salt water. They run up the rivers also.\r\nThey belong to the salmon family. Then there are trout of different\r\nkinds, and at the northern part of James bay there is Hearne’s salmon.\r\nThey are small salmon, but of very fine quality. The flesh is equal to\r\nthat of the common salmon, perhaps better. It is firm and red and well\r\nflavoured. Hearne’s salmon seldom exceeds ten pounds in weight. It is\r\nalso found all around Hudson bay, and on both sides of Hudson strait.\r\n\r\nThe porpoise, or more properly speaking, the small white whale, is\r\nabundant in James bay.\r\n\r\nDoctor Bell expressed the opinion that the fisheries of Hudson bay will,\r\nno doubt, be very valuable.\r\n\r\nMr. A. P. Low, before the Senate committee of 1907, stated that the fish\r\nin the inland waters of Keewatin are like those in the other northern\r\nparts of Canada, and fairly abundant especially in the larger lakes. The\r\nchief fish are the whitefish and the lake trout. In Hudson bay the\r\nwhitefish and the ordinary river trout have sea-going habits, and the\r\nIndians take quite a number along the shores in nets, more especially in\r\nJames bay.\r\n\r\nMr. Low reported sturgeon as being plentiful in Favourable lake.\r\n\r\nMr. J. B. Tyrrell in his report speaks as follows of the game and fish\r\nin that area in the southwest of this region (See p. 19) explored by him\r\nin 1896:—“The country is stocked with animals of various kinds. Moose\r\nare abundant in some of the more thickly wooded tracts. Black bears are\r\nsomewhat numerous, and beaver, otters, martens, mink, muskrats and red\r\nfoxes are killed by the Indians in considerable numbers in the aggregate\r\nevery year.\r\n\r\n                            WHITEFISH ABOUND\r\n\r\nin most of the lakes and streams, while the lake trout seemed to be\r\nmoderately plentiful in the clear lakes near the head of Grass river. Of\r\nthe other fish, the sturgeon and pickerel (_Stizostethium vitreum_) are\r\nthe most important. The region was known among the early fur traders as\r\nthe Muskrat country. Trout and whitefish are said to abound in Reed\r\nlake.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Moose crossing Limestone river.]\r\n\r\nNear the forks of the Muhigan large game was very plentiful, and Mr.\r\nTyrrell saw eleven moose in one day.\r\n\r\nAs to his survey of the Ekwan district in 1901, Mr. D. B. Dowling\r\nreports:—“The principal fur-bearing animals of this region are foxes,\r\notters and beavers. Of the larger mammals few appear to be taken by the\r\nIndians. In the interior the game birds are all very scarce, the fall\r\nhunt for ducks and geese being confined to the shores of the bay. The\r\nrivers afford a small supply of whitefish. The streams running to the\r\nnorth into Hudson bay in this region are, at certain seasons, well\r\nstocked with speckled trout. Sutton Mill lake is well supplied with a\r\nslender variety of lake trout, and at the narrows, speckled trout were\r\nalso caught.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dowling mentions that at the foot of the first fall met with\r\nascending Trout lake river from Little Shallow lake, the Indians form\r\nlarge camps in the autumn to catch whitefish as they are ascending the\r\nriver to the spawning grounds.\r\n\r\n                         THE BEST FOOD FISHES.\r\n\r\nMr. McInnes, in the report of his explorations about Winisk and\r\nAttawapiskat rivers (See p. 23), says:—“Whitefish and sturgeon are the\r\nbest food fishes, and occur in most of the lakes. Both are taken in\r\nnets, and the latter also by spearing from scaffolds built out over\r\nrapids in the river. Doré and pike are also generally distributed over\r\nthe whole area, and form an important source of food supply, though the\r\nsucker among the fishes, like the rabbit among the mammals, holds the\r\nmost important place, as it can be caught everywhere, not only in the\r\nlarger lakes but also in the smaller ponds and streams. Brook trout were\r\nactually caught only in Winisk river near its mouth, and in the streams\r\nrunning into Albany river, but were seen in the rapids below Weibikwei;\r\nthe Indians assert that they occur also in the lake itself. Lake trout\r\nwere caught in large numbers in Trout lake at the head of Severn river,\r\nbut are not found in either the Winisk or Attawapiskat waters.\r\n\r\n“The moose (_Alces americanus_) has been found as far north as the\r\nsouthern shore of Weibikwei lake, in north latitude 52° 50′, though\r\ntracks were actually seen during our exploration only as far north as\r\nAttawapiskat river. Even here it is not nearly so plentiful as farther\r\nsouth in the belt of country lying near the Canadian Pacific Railway and\r\nextending for about one hundred and fifty miles north of it. Caribou\r\n(_Rangifer caribou_) range all over the district. No red deer are found\r\nanywhere throughout the region. The fur-bearing animals, though not so\r\nplentiful as they once were, are still fairly abundant throughout the\r\ndistrict; the otter and the beaver from long-continued trapping are less\r\nnumerous, perhaps, than any other species.”\r\n\r\nBears, Mr. McInnes says, are taken in good numbers, and foxes, including\r\nthe red, silver, black and cross varieties are numerous. Otters and pine\r\nmartens are taken in good numbers and beavers occur more sparingly.\r\nMinks and muskrats are plentiful. That the raccoon occasionally strays\r\nas far north as north latitude 52° is shown by the fact of one being\r\ntaken by an Indian woman on upper Attawapiskat river in 1903.\r\n\r\nMr. McInnes describes Atikameg (locally known as Clearwater), Cormorant\r\nand Reed lakes as “very beautiful sheets of clear water, well stocked\r\nwith fish, including lake trout and whitefish.”\r\n\r\nMr. McInnes, in his evidence before the Senate committee of 1907,\r\nexpressed the opinion that if the region lying west of Hudson bay were\r\nopened up by railways there would be a considerable business in\r\nexploiting the fisheries, because the sturgeon is valuable. They would\r\nget the sturgeon on the lower Nelson and part of the Churchill. Big\r\nlease-holding companies put steamers on the various lake expansions on\r\nthe Nelson, so that they reached down to within a few miles of Split\r\nlake, and marketed sturgeon in that way. They put tramways on all the\r\nportages. They ran that way for a couple of summers, but the distance\r\nwas too great and it did not pay. The larger lakes have good whitefish\r\nand sturgeon. The head of the Adawadskit was particularly full of\r\nsturgeon. Going out Mr. McInnes’s party was short of pork and stopped\r\none day to get supplies. In one night’s fishing the Indians caught so\r\nmany sturgeon that they had enough to carry them for one hundred and\r\nfifty miles to the Hudson’s Bay Company’s post. One of the sturgeon\r\n\r\n                          WAS THREE FEET LONG.\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of the Winisk the Indians were catching speckled trout and\r\nwhitefish in very large numbers. In fact the Indians of all that\r\ninterior country live on fish. They smoke and dry them to a limited\r\nextent, and late in the autumn catch them before the larger lakes are\r\nfrozen over, when the temperature is low enough to freeze the fish. They\r\ncatch enough to put by for the winter. Some are sent to Chicago frozen.\r\n\r\nIn his report (See p. 60) of the survey made by his party in 1910 of the\r\narea south of Cross lake, Mr. J. R. Dickson states:—“The deeper lakes\r\nall abound in whitefish of the finest size and quality. In Paint lake\r\nduring the mayfly season (July up there) their dorsal fins could be seen\r\ncutting the water everywhere. Pickerel, and of course jackfish and\r\nsuckers are likewise very abundant. We had no sturgeon net, but we saw\r\nquite a number jumping in Sipiwesk lake. Altogether the fishing industry\r\nshould be a decidedly profitable one after the railway goes through.\r\nMuch of that region is suited only, and admirably, to producing a\r\npermanent revenue from this source. The beaver have been almost\r\nexterminated, but mink, fisher, muskrat and other fur-bearers are still\r\nfairly numerous. As to large game, moose and caribou are plentiful, but\r\nwe saw no elk or bear. More stringent game laws will shortly be\r\nnecessary with the opening of the country to white hunters. Nearly all\r\nthose northern lakes are thickly studded with beautiful islands—quite a\r\nsimilar Laurentian country to Muskoka, but on a more extensive scale.\r\nSome future day these large island-studded lakes will become popular\r\nsummer playgrounds for the people of the prairies, for the July and\r\nAugust weather is delightful. As yet of course, they are almost\r\ninaccessible.”\r\n\r\nMr. McLaggan, who explored the country in 1907, describes the waters\r\nbetween The Pas and Clearwater lake as abounding in trout, whitefish,\r\njackfish and pike. Reed lake is studded with many islands and replete\r\nwith large trout, whitefish, pike and pickerel. Grass river, where it\r\nbroadens into the long stretch known as Setting lake, is described by\r\nMr. McLaggan as one of the most beautiful sheets of water he has ever\r\nseen and quite comparable to the St. Lawrence where it passes through\r\nthe Thousand islands. He looks forward to it becoming a great summer\r\nresort. Goose river is very shallow and so teems with whitefish that\r\nthey seem to cover the bottom and can be killed with sticks. Generally,\r\nalong his route, Mr. McLaggan “found game in great plenty and immense\r\nwaters teeming with fish.” W. Thibaudeau, C.E., states in his report\r\n(See p. 23):—“In September, October and part of November large shoals\r\nof white whales (I counted thirty-five in one shoal) could be seen going\r\nup river at Churchill at every tide. Salmon, trout and whitefish are\r\ntaken in the river and harbor all the year, but are more abundant in the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n                    WITHIN A FEW MILES OF CHURCHILL,\r\n\r\nin the fall and winter, large herds of barren lands caribou were\r\nencountered. These herds supply fresh meat of an excellent quality for\r\nthe residents of Churchill. Polar bears are occasionally shot in the\r\nvicinity of Churchill. Along the western peninsula Eskimo congregate in\r\nthe spring for the purpose of seal hunting, these animals frequenting\r\nthese shores in the spring in large numbers. Among the fur bearing\r\nanimals are found black fox, silver fox, red and white fox, marten, and\r\nwolves both black and gray. Swans, geese, ptarmigan and many species of\r\nduck in large numbers, and some spruce grouse are found along the shores\r\nof Churchill harbour and river.\r\n\r\nReferring specially to his exploration of that part of the country\r\nbetween Churchill and Owl river in December, 1906, Mr. Thibaudeau\r\nstates:—“For one whole day we passed through an immense herd of barren\r\nlands caribou. There must have been thousands of them.”\r\n\r\nReporting on the fish and game along the route of his exploration trip\r\nfrom Churchill to The Pas, Mr. Thibaudeau says:—“From timber line on\r\nHudson bay to The Pas are found moose and caribou in fair quantities.\r\nRabbits are scarce throughout the country explored. Saw a few spruce\r\ngrouse; ptarmigan are found plentifully, but not further south than\r\nGrass river. Whitefish abound in all the lakes from Churchill to The\r\nPas; also in some lakes are found trout, pike and suckers. Indians and\r\ntravellers rely upon this source of supply for dog feed.”\r\n\r\nMr. William Beech, of Churchill, in his communication to the press\r\nalready quoted, writes:—“Fur-bearing animals exist in large quantities,\r\nand in many varieties, throughout the woods and along the shores and\r\nrivers. I have seen enormous white polar bears three hundred yards from\r\nmy house as early as August 9, and at times they are very aggressive.\r\nWolves are numerous, and very bold at times, so bold in fact that I have\r\nfrequently heard them running round upon the roof above my head. White,\r\nred and black foxes, and a few of the rare silver variety are to be\r\nfound at all seasons, and are\r\n\r\n                    VALUABLE FOR THE FUR THEY BEAR.\r\n\r\nCaribou roam in herds, and are very good eating, while seals, ducks,\r\nptarmigan, geese and swans abound throughout the districts round about.\r\nCurlew, snipe, and loons also provide good shooting. Of fur-bearing\r\nanimals besides foxes there are beaver, otter, mink, ermine, and\r\nwolverine, innumerable.\r\n\r\n“Great sport is afforded to those who are so inclined in harpooning\r\nwhales. I have counted as many as twenty in one school, going up the\r\nriver at almost every tide, and an impressive sight it is. In summer at\r\nChurchill the Hudson’s Bay Company capture many white whales, from ten\r\nto fifteen feet in length and weighing from one thousand to two thousand\r\npounds, by the use of extra strong nets. The flesh is cut up and kept to\r\nfeed the dogs in winter, while the blubber is boiled down at the factory\r\nand the hides are sent to England.\r\n\r\n“It will surprise you, perhaps, when I tell you that we fish on dry land\r\nat Churchill. That is a fact, nevertheless. The natives of Churchill,\r\nboth Indians and Eskimos, and also the white men, set their nets on dry\r\nland. They set their nets, which are about fifteen feet long, with three\r\nupright posts placed vertically on the shore. When they have set them\r\nthey simply wait for the tide to come in, and when it has come in they\r\nsimply wait until it has gone out, and there are their fish all ready to\r\nbe taken out without any trouble. The catch consists chiefly of\r\nwhitefish, salmon trout, and pickerel, all of good quality.\r\n\r\n“When the Hudson bay route is completed, one of the best fishing trades\r\nin the world will be opened up. There are five lakes, in all, in the\r\ndistrict, all full of fish, and the farthest teaming which is necessary\r\nwould be about forty miles. On lake Winnipeg at the present time, fish\r\nare hauled a distance of one hundred and forty miles, and they are\r\nteamed into Edmonton from Lesser Slave lake, a distance of one hundred\r\nand seventy-five miles and made to pay. The salmon of the north averages\r\nfrom four to ten pounds in weight, and is of good quality; the whitefish\r\nis not so large as that of Lake Winnipeg, but it is of fine flavor, and\r\nvery firm. The caplin, a small fish resembling the sardine, is found in\r\nsuch quantities at some seasons of the year that they are left in\r\nthousands upon the shore when the tide goes out. Fishing usually\r\ncommences at the latter part of June and finishes at the end of August.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN.\r\n\r\n                      Agriculture and Arable Land.\r\n\r\n   An Early Scientific Explorer’s Enthusiastic Description of Part of\r\n     the Country.—“Capable of Any Extent of Cultivation.”—An Old\r\n     Hudson’s Bay Company’s Official Who Considered it “A Splendid\r\n     Country to Settle in.”—Mr. Crean Reports That “It is no\r\n     Experiment” to Raise Wheat in North Saskatchewan.—Missionary\r\n     Farmers and Their Accomplishments.—Capable of Supporting “A\r\n     Dense, Thriving Population.”—“A Splendid Ranching Country.”—\r\n     Heaviest Rains Just When they are Needed.\r\n\r\nTo obtain a correct idea of the resources of that part of the province\r\nof Saskatchewan north of North Saskatchewan river, one has to consider\r\nthat great extent of territory as consisting of two very distinct areas,\r\none to the south, the other to the north of Churchill river. While the\r\narea to the south of the Churchill is a well-wooded, park-like country,\r\nwith great agricultural possibilities, the soil of the region north of\r\nthat river, so far as explorations up to this time have shown, is mainly\r\nsandy and sterile.\r\n\r\nThanks to its being crossed by the old fur traders’ portage routes from\r\nCumberland House, Fort à la Corne and Fort Carlton, on the Saskatchewan,\r\nto Frog portage on the upper Churchill and Methye portage on the\r\nClearwater, the southern part of the region immediately under review has\r\nbeen known and written about for many years, but there is very little\r\nindeed in the ancient writings worthy of notice in this chapter. The\r\nfirst white travellers over the long and toilsome water routes of this\r\nbeautiful country of swift-running rivers and isle-studded lakes were\r\nthe enterprising fur traders from Montreal, who in course of time\r\ncombined to form the Northwest Company. Their interests were all centred\r\nin the fur trade, and while travelling through the country, business,\r\ntime and the exigencies of the commissariat combined to\r\n\r\n                      PREVENT THEM FROM EXPLORING\r\n\r\nthe country with a view to investigating its natural resources, even if\r\nthey had any inclination to do so, which is doubtful. At any rate such\r\nof these pioneer travellers through this country as ventured to write\r\nabout their travels devoted their literary efforts to describing their\r\nadventures en route, their camps, the methods and habits of the\r\nvoyageurs and Indians, the Indian camping places, and the rivers, lakes\r\nand overland trails traversed. Generally very minute details were given\r\nin these old books of travel as to the geographical features of the\r\ncountry, distances, bearings, the direction and currents of the rivers,\r\nthe size, shapes and relative situation of the lakes, etc., but one\r\nreads over page after page, and book after book, without finding a\r\nsingle reference to the soil, or to the possibilities of the country\r\nfrom an agricultural point of view. In the course of time the opening up\r\nto the fur trade of the farther northwest on the banks of Athabaska and\r\nMackenzie rivers resulted in a greatly increased amount of travel over\r\nthe old canoe routes, but it did not attract attention to the natural\r\nwealth of this region, and until recent years the attractions this\r\ncountry offers to the agricultural settler have remained unrecognized.\r\n\r\nSir Alexander Mackenzie, in his book (1801), states that “no part of\r\nthis country has ever been cultivated by natives or Europeans, except a\r\nsmall garden at Ile à la Crosse, which well repaid the labour bestowed\r\nupon it.”\r\n\r\nExamined before the British parliamentary committee of 1857, Richard\r\nKing, M.D., surgeon and naturalist to the expedition in 1833 in search\r\nof Sir J. Ross, was asked:—“Are you under the impression that there is\r\nany portion of the territory which you then saw that would be available\r\nfor the purpose of settlement?” He replied:—“Yes, I found a very large\r\ncountry, as it appeared to me at that date. I hold in my hand one of\r\nArrowsmith’s very best and recent maps, he being the great authority\r\nupon that country, and the square piece of country which I always looked\r\nupon as a very fertile valley is there distinctly shown. It is bounded\r\non the south by Cumberland House, on the Saskatchewan. It is an enormous\r\ntract of country. Cumberland territory is, according to Sir J.\r\nRichardson, I find, several thousand square miles. Then it is bounded by\r\nAthabaska lake on the north. I am not now exactly giving it north and\r\nsouth. I may state that I passed through a great portion of that\r\ncountry, but of course what I am saying as to the larger portion that I\r\nam now speaking of, is not only from my own personal observation upon\r\nit, but from an inquiry upon the spot, seeing the nature and extent of\r\nthat country. This large portion which I have described as within this\r\narea I looked upon as the\r\n\r\n                   MOST FERTILE PORTION WHICH I SAW.\r\n\r\n“On this map it is very clear. You will see the country entirely\r\nsurrounded by water.”\r\n\r\nAsked if he meant to express an opinion that the whole of that territory\r\nwas suitable, as regards soil and climate, for the purpose of\r\ncultivation, Doctor King replied that he was told by the traders there\r\ngenerally that it was precisely the same land as that which he passed\r\nthrough, namely, a rich soil, interspersed with well-wooded country,\r\nthere being growth of every kind, and the whole vegetable kingdom alive.\r\n\r\nDoctor King impressed upon the committee the fact that in going through\r\nthat country his position was that of a naturalist; he “came away\r\ncertainly with the impression that it was a very magnificent country in\r\nmany parts of it; of course there were barren portions, but upon the\r\nwhole, up to Athabaska lake, it appeared to me to be capable of any\r\nextent of cultivation.”\r\n\r\nDoctor King said that some time previous to his visit to that locality\r\nthere had been some agricultural activity at the Hudson’s Bay Company’s\r\npost at Cumberland House due to the enterprise of Governor Williams.\r\nDoctor King found capacious barns, and implements in fields which had\r\nevidently been placed under culture. On approaching Cumberland House, he\r\nhad found a little new colony of thirty persons established, a Canadian,\r\nan Englishman, and half-breeds. They had their fields divided out into\r\nfarms, and other things. It was described to him that they had formed a\r\nlittle colony at Cumberland House but had been\r\n\r\n                  ORDERED FROM THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY\r\n\r\nby the Hudson’s Bay Company. The settlers told Doctor King that “at the\r\ntime they were ordered off, the Company would not allow them to go on\r\ncultivating; that it was against the Company, and that therefore the\r\nthing was to be broken up, etc., etc.”\r\n\r\nAs to the little new settlement, Doctor King stated that it appeared to\r\nhim, in going over the colonists’ farms, that they were very highly\r\ncultivated. There was corn, wheat, and barley growing. He bought a calf\r\nfrom them; he gave seven shillings for it. A fat bullock sold for twelve\r\nshillings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Haying near Green lake.]\r\n\r\nDoctor King testified that when he went on to Cumberland House, he found\r\nthat the settlers were really borne out in what they had stated, for he\r\nfound that the barns and implements were in the fields, and that the\r\ncows, oxen, and horses had all gone wild. He enquired the reason of it\r\nand was told that Governor Williams had a penchant for farming and that\r\nthe Company had ordered him off somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHon. William Christie, formerly Inspecting Chief Factor of the Hudson’s\r\nBay Company, before the Senate committee of 1888, explained that there\r\nwas a vast extent of splendid country from Prince Albert on the whole\r\nnorth side of the Saskatchewan, going away up until the traveller came\r\nnear Fort Pitt, keeping a little to the north. Then, when he would come\r\nto the route of Green lake, there was two days’ journey through a\r\nmagnificent country, beautifully timbered, well watered and supplied\r\nwith abundance of fish. As he once travelled through it, he remarked to\r\none of his men,—\r\n\r\n                “WHAT A SPLENDID COUNTRY TO SETTLE IN.”\r\n\r\nGreen lake, witness explained, is north of Carlton, about eighty miles.\r\nOne crosses at Carlton and for two days can travel through a prairie\r\ncountry with bluffs here and there, and lakes; it is a splendid country.\r\nThen he would travel for two days through a forest to Green lake.\r\n\r\nProfessor John Macoun, in the Dominion Government Canadian Pacific\r\nRailway Report of 1877-8, says:—“I was at Ile à la Crosse (almost due\r\nnorth of Battleford) on September 22, 1875, and saw potatoes still green\r\nas they were in July. I was told by Mr. Cummins that these potatoes\r\nhardly ever were killed by frost in September. Here there was a flour\r\nmill driven by horse-power and I am told that all kinds of grain ripen\r\nsuccessfully.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Macoun in his book “Manitoba and the Great Northwest,”\r\npublished in 1882, made the following reference to the northern portion\r\nof Saskatchewan as an agricultural country:—“About fifty miles north of\r\nCarlton the ‘Star Mission,’ in connection with the Church of England, is\r\nsituated. This Mission was established in 1874, and placed in charge of\r\nthe Rev. Mr. Hinds, who, besides being a minister, was a practical\r\nfarmer. He at once commenced to teach the old men farming and the\r\nchildren English, and in less than one year had a number of small farms\r\ncommenced, and the children well advanced in the knowledge of English.\r\nSince then he has been very successful, and in 1879 Mr. O’Keeffe,\r\nD.L.S., writes of the Mission: ‘At Sandy lake the Indians under the\r\nsupervision of the Rev. Mr. Hinds, Church of England Missionary, were\r\ncultivating successfully fine fields of grain and raising vegetables.’\r\nOf the country in this vicinity the same writer says: ‘No finer country\r\ncould be desired than the section above described. The water is pure and\r\nabundant, and the land extremely rich. Pea vine, vetches, grasses, and,\r\nin fact, all herbaceous plants were luxuriant.’”\r\n\r\nIn the report of his explorations during the years 1893 and 1894, Mr. J.\r\nBurr Tyrrell gives the following general description of this area:—“The\r\ncountry between Saskatchewan and Churchill rivers is very different from\r\nthat north of the latter stream. From Prince Albert, situated on the\r\nbanks of the North Saskatchewan, at an elevation of one thousand four\r\nhundred feet above the sea, the surface rises with a gentle slope\r\nnorthward to a heavy stony moraine ridge, the highest point of which, on\r\nGreen lake trail, was found to have an elevation of about two thousand\r\ntwo hundred and twenty feet. From this high ridge the country slopes\r\ngradually northward, at first with a gentle rolling, and afterwards with\r\na more even surface, to the chain of lakes and extensive swamps that lie\r\nalong the edge of the district directly underlain by Archaean rocks.\r\nThis country has very much the general appearance of that portion of\r\nnorthwestern Manitoba to the west of lakes Manitoba and Winnipegosis,\r\nincluding Duck and Riding mountains, previously described by the\r\nwriter.”\r\n\r\nBetween Churchill and Saskatchewan rivers two lines were examined by Mr.\r\nTyrrell, one from Prince Albert northwestward by Green lake to Ile à la\r\nCrosse, and the other from Stanley Mission southwestward by Montreal\r\nlake to Prince Albert.\r\n\r\nWriting of some of the more noticeable geographical features of this\r\narea Mr. Tyrrell says:—“Churchill river from its northern source at\r\nMethye portage, following its windings, has a length of four hundred and\r\neighty miles to the mouth of Reindeer river. It is a long series of very\r\nirregular lakes filled with clear blue water, connected by short and\r\nusually rapid reaches. Some of the rapids are produced by rocky\r\nbarriers, while others are over boulders and between banks of till, such\r\nas is underlying much of the surrounding country.\r\n\r\n“The largest tributaries flowing into the Churchill from the south are\r\nBeaver, Sandy and Rapid rivers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flowers at Ile à La Crosse.]\r\n\r\n“Beaver river rises on the Cretaceous plateau, not far from Lac la\r\nBiche, and, flowing, first eastward for two hundred and fifty miles, and\r\nthen northward for a hundred miles, empties into the south end of Ile à\r\nla Crosse lake. Its course northward was alone surveyed. Here it is a\r\nrapid stream from one hundred to two hundred feet wide, flowing between\r\nlow clay banks, beautifully wooded with spruce and poplar. Much of the\r\nland along the course appeared to be well adapted for agricultural\r\npurposes, and the rank vegetation gave\r\n\r\n                     PROMISE OF ABUNDANT HARVESTS.”\r\n\r\nThe Venerable Archdeacon J. McKay, one of the best known Church of\r\nEngland Missionaries of the Canadian west, was examined before the\r\nSenate committee of 1907. He stated that he was born on the eastern\r\nshore of James bay, near Rupert’s House. His father was a Hudson’s Bay\r\nCompany’s officer. Witness had his education in Manitoba in the early\r\ndays. He had been more in the old country than in eastern Canada. He\r\nlived at Moose Factory until he was eighteen.\r\n\r\nArchdeacon McKay explained that he had been forty-five years in the\r\nwest, in charge of missions of the Church of England, and was ten years\r\nat a place on Churchill river, a little north of Lac la Ronge. The\r\nnearest point to Lac la Ronge on the map is where the Anglican mission\r\nis situated, about ten miles north of Lac la Ronge, on Churchill river.\r\nThis is about due north from Prince Albert, and in a straight line it\r\nwould be considerably over two hundred miles from Prince Albert. He had\r\nbeen for some time superintendent of the Anglican missions. For the two\r\nyears preceding his examination he had been at Lac la Ronge. He had been\r\nas far north in this country as Lake Cariboo. In fact he had been away\r\nto the north end of Reindeer lake. It is very poor country up there, and\r\nthe trees are not very large. From the Churchill he had been down to\r\nHudson bay, and he had been as far west as Ile à la Crosse lake and on\r\nto Methye lake, which is not many miles south of Clearwater river and in\r\nan east-southeasterly direction from McMurray.\r\n\r\nThe land between Lac la Ronge and Prince Albert in some places is very\r\ngood. It is all forest practically until to about thirty miles from\r\nPrince Albert, or perhaps twenty or thirty. Then the open country begins\r\nwhere it is not heavily timbered. To the west of Lac la Ronge the\r\ncountry is very much the same. It is not rocky, some muskeg and some\r\npretty good land, but all timbered—in some places heavy timber. There\r\nis spruce and poplar. The spruce is good enough for lumber, and of\r\ncourse it would do for pulpwood. The witness had travelled the country\r\nabout Lac la Ronge pretty thoroughly, and if it were cleared of timber\r\nit would, in his opinion, be generally\r\n\r\n                        FAIR AGRICULTURAL LAND.\r\n\r\nThe rocky country is north of that.\r\n\r\nSo far as agriculture at Lac la Ronge is concerned, Archdeacon McKay\r\nsaid he had raised good wheat at his former mission on Churchill river\r\nfor seven years in succession without having it frosted. The climate is\r\ngood. It is a rocky country, and there is not a great deal of good land;\r\nbut so far as the climate is concerned it is all right for raising\r\nanything that can be raised in Saskatchewan generally. Potatoes grow\r\nsplendidly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Potatoes at Anglican Mission, Lac la Ronge.]\r\n\r\nHe could not describe what the grasses are, but they are grasses that\r\ngrow mostly in moist land, something like slough hay, grasses that grow\r\non the margins of lakes, and along the rivers. There was not much stock\r\nthere, but he had stock when he lived on the mission on Churchill river,\r\nfifteen head of cattle and two horses. That is a little north of Lac la\r\nRonge, and is practically the same country. As to the Lake Ile à la\r\nCrosse country, he considered it fairly good. It is not rocky and there\r\nis plenty of timber and plenty of hay as a rule—some prairie hay and\r\nsome swamp hay, and the soil is fairly good—better than Lac la Ronge.\r\nIt gets better as you go west. It is certainly better about Ile à la\r\nCrosse than at Lac la Ronge, and there is no rock country about Ile à la\r\nCrosse. The hay is long. It is very much the same as the natural hay in\r\nManitoba. The only whites in the country he had described north of the\r\nSaskatchewan were the Hudson’s Bay Company’s officials and traders.\r\nThere is no agricultural settlement at Lac la Ronge. There are only\r\nIndians there, and they have not gone into anything in the direction of\r\nagriculture more than raising a few potatoes.\r\n\r\nArchdeacon McKay stated that it is a peculiarity of that part of the\r\ncountry around Lac la Ronge that the frosts are very late. On a small\r\nisland in the lake Archdeacon McKay has seen potatoes in the beginning\r\nof October with the\r\n\r\n                       VINES UNTOUCHED BY FROSTS\r\n\r\nat that late season. That was of course on account of the large body of\r\nwater that equalized the temperature. On the mainland that would\r\nprobably not be the case, but two years ago he was at Lac la Ronge when\r\nMr. Chisholm, the Indian Inspector, came out to make treaty payments\r\ntowards the end of August, probably August 20, and the potato vines were\r\nnot touched at all either on the mainland or on the islands. The\r\nsnowfall is not very heavy. It is generally a little heavier than in\r\nPrince Albert section of the country, but not always so. Three feet on\r\nthe level would be considered deep snow. As a rule the first frosts come\r\nsome time in September. In 1906 the potatoes were touched with frost\r\nabout September 15, but not seriously. In the spring one can put in\r\ngrain from May 5 as a rule. He used to sow wheat May 5 generally, and\r\nplant potatoes from May 20 on. The lowest temperature in winter, judging\r\nfrom his own sensations, was about the same as Prince Albert. In the\r\nsummer time it is quite as hot at Lac la Ronge as at Prince Albert. It\r\nis farther north and the days are longer.\r\n\r\nThe weather at Lac la Ronge is moderately dry. Generally there is\r\nsufficient rainfall for the crops. In the summer of 1906 there was quite\r\na long spell of dry weather, which affected the wild fruits. It was an\r\nexceptional spell of dry weather, but generally there is a good\r\nrainfall. The rainy season would be quite equal to Manitoba.\r\n\r\nRichard S. Cook, Esq., Mayor of the city of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan,\r\nwas examined before the Senate committee of 1907. He stated that he had\r\nat the date of his examination by the committee been engaged in farming\r\nat Prince Albert for fifteen years. He had a large stock and dairy farm,\r\noperated it successfully, and had made it pay every year. Mr. Cook\r\nstated that he had travelled considerably over the country about Prince\r\nAlbert, particularly to the north and northwest of that city. He had\r\ngone north from Battleford and down Beaver river. Little is known of\r\nthat country. It has always been travelled by canoe. Stanley Mission was\r\nthe farthest north he had been, two hundred and fifty miles north of\r\nPrince Albert, and about the same distance north of Battleford. The\r\ncountry in that northern district is fit to be an empire in itself, and\r\na wealthy one. People knew little of it yet, but it was going to prove\r\nan excellent country for agriculture. It was such an immense country it\r\nwas hard to grasp the possibilities of it. One might travel over it for\r\nyears and know very little about it. There is very little open country\r\nthere, except where the fire has gone, but about seventy-five per cent.\r\nof the soil in that country is good, capable of being cleared up and\r\nbecoming good agricultural land. The area must be at the least about two\r\nhundred and fifty miles by two hundred and fifty miles. In travelling\r\nabout the country, he had examined the region about Fort Pitt, Beaver\r\nlake, Moose lake and Cold lake. For a considerable distance immediately\r\nback from Saskatchewan river the soil is light; not a very good country.\r\nThe country immediately behind Fort Pitt, however,\r\n\r\n                       IS FIT FOR RAISING GRAIN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oat field at Anglican Mission, Lac la Ronge.]\r\n\r\nThe further north one goes in that country the better it is. The\r\naltitude is gradually getting less, and on Chipewyan reserve, south of\r\nCold lake, there is as fine land as he had ever seen in his life. The\r\ngrass is four and one half feet long, and people had been known to grow\r\none hundred tons of hay the first season. Mr. Cook doubted whether wheat\r\nwould grow the first year.\r\n\r\nAround Cold lake the fires had been very destructive. There had been\r\ntimber there, and where it had been burnt over the grass was good. The\r\nsoil was all right and the pea vine growing, and good rich grass, so\r\nthat he thought the country down the Beaver would be a fairly good\r\nagricultural country. This district is one hundred and fifty miles north\r\nof the Saskatchewan. It would be northwest of Battleford about one\r\nhundred and fifty miles. At Stanley and Churchill, two hundred and fifty\r\nmiles north of Prince Albert, they were raising all kinds of stuff.\r\nThere was a sheaf of wheat in the Board of Trade in Prince Albert which\r\nwas brought from there, and it was certainly a very fine specimen. Mr.\r\nCook thought that in the area he had visited in the north there was a\r\ncountry that would be settled up and sustain a large population. The\r\nfires had been very destructive in parts of the Stanley country. The\r\nsoil throughout at one time was a good soil, but where the fires were\r\nvery heavy and hot it burnt the top of the soil. He would judge that\r\nseventy-three per cent. of that country would have good agricultural\r\nsoil as soon as it was cleaned out.\r\n\r\nSettlements had been started twenty miles north of Prince Albert, and\r\nsome years ago an American went in there and he now has a beautiful\r\nfarm. The witness brought in a collection of vegetables from that\r\ncountry, and he never saw a better lot of farmers’ produce in his life.\r\nThis original American pioneer was growing Turner raspberries, and\r\nanyone will tell you that where you can grow Turner raspberries, fall\r\nwheat will grow, and where fall wheat will grow the climate is fit for\r\nanything. The settler in question got the Turner raspberries from Mr.\r\nCook in Prince Albert. It takes a certain climate to grow that\r\nraspberry, and they claim the same climate will grow fall wheat. It is\r\nnot the wild raspberry of the country, but a variety sent out from the\r\nexperimental farm in Ottawa. Wild raspberries grow all through that\r\ncountry. That one man starting out demonstrated that the climate was all\r\nright, and others followed suit, and there are now one hundred and fifty\r\nor two hundred settlers in that country, which was considered a few\r\nyears ago as no good. The same remarks apply to the country clean out to\r\nCandle lake. That country is fairly clear and open, and there is some\r\nhazel brush, and where hazel brush will grow the land is considered\r\ngood, and where poplar will grow it is also considered good soil.\r\n\r\nMayor Cook expressed the opinion that\r\n\r\n                     LACK OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION\r\n\r\nwas all that kept the tide of settlement from flowing into that northern\r\ncountry. He went on to explain that the people out on the Saskatchewan\r\nand north of it anticipate being able to ship by the Hudson bay route.\r\nThey are all expecting it. They consider that there is not a question of\r\ndoubt but that it will be successful. They expect an open route via\r\nHudson bay for half of July, all of August, September, October, November\r\nand part of December. Witness was speaking from the information received\r\nfrom people who spent their lives on Hudson bay. Many of the Hudson’s\r\nBay Company’s officials came in to Prince Albert district to settle,\r\nafter they had been superannuated. From information obtained from these\r\nold Hudson’s Bay Company’s men, his honest opinion was that it was a\r\nperfectly feasible route for the months he had given:—half of July, all\r\nof August, September, October, November and a part of December.\r\n\r\nMr. Cook, concluding, remarked: “When you are shipping out your cattle,\r\nyou are sending them by the short route, and the shrinkage will be\r\nlight. One feed, and probably none at all, would last to Churchill. The\r\nshort route would also make it possible to ship out at least one-third\r\nof the crop before the frost sets in, which would be a great relief to\r\nthe settlers.”\r\n\r\nW. F. Bredin, Esq., member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, for\r\nthe Division of Athabaska, and residing at Lesser Slave lake, was\r\nexamined before the Senate committee of 1907 and stated that at the date\r\nof his examination he had resided ten years in the country north of\r\nEdmonton. He had been from Edmonton north to Fort Wrigley, and he had\r\nbeen on Peace river from Fort St. John, thirty miles inside the British\r\nColumbia line, to about five hundred miles down the Peace—from that\r\npoint. Ten years previous to his examination he went down the Athabaska\r\nto the Mackenzie in boats.\r\n\r\nMr. Bredin referred briefly to a trip he made east from Athabaska\r\ndistrict during the summer of 1906, when he travelled from McMurray up\r\nClearwater river and thence across to Prince Albert. The land on\r\nClearwater river for one hundred miles, in the bottoms, is very good. It\r\nappeared to him, from the river, however, to be very sandy back on the\r\nhigh rocks. He should think there would be a good deal of rock and\r\nmuskeg. From where he left Clearwater river in to Prince Albert, on the\r\nNorth Saskatchewan, the country was more or less of a sandy nature.\r\nThere were beautiful lakes all the way, filled with good whitefish and\r\ntrout. The whole northern country is that way.\r\n\r\nIn his evidence before the Senate committee of 1907, Mr. H. A. Conroy\r\nremarked:—“There is some good country along the Clearwater—very nice\r\ncountry from an agricultural point of view.”\r\n\r\n                           THE CREAN REPORTS.\r\n\r\nA great amount of invaluable information as to the natural resources of\r\nthe region south of Churchill and Clearwater rivers is contained in the\r\nreport by Frank J. P. Crean, C.E., of his explorations (See p. 25) in\r\n1908 and 1909. It is interesting to note that this work of exploration\r\nwas the first ever undertaken in a systematic way to ascertain the\r\nagricultural possibilities of Canada’s northland.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. R. E. Young, Superintendent of the Railway Lands Branch of\r\nthe Department of the Interior, under whose direction, and at whose\r\ninstance, these explorations were conducted, in forwarding Mr. Crean’s\r\nfirst report, wrote:—“Mr. Crean’s report gives a great deal of useful\r\ninformation about the district, and the results of his observations\r\nappear to shew that mixed farming may confidently be expected to prove\r\nsuccessful over a large area. When the country is made accessible by\r\nroads a considerable settlement of agriculturists may, I think, be\r\nlooked for. The country is also shewn by his report to be rich in\r\nnatural resources.”\r\n\r\nIn forwarding Mr. Crean’s second report to the minister, Mr. Young\r\nwrote:—“The exploration in the year 1909 shows results even more\r\nsatisfactory as to the possibilities of the country for settlement than\r\nthe exploration of the previous year. A very considerable proportion of\r\nthe area explored is shewn by Mr. Crean’s observations to be well\r\nadapted for mixed farming and to have natural resources of timber, hay,\r\nfish and game which will be of much value to incoming settlers. Results\r\nof actual operations in cattle raising are of a most encouraging nature.\r\nAt and in the vicinity of Meadow lake over one hundred miles north of\r\nBattleford, there are herds of cattle aggregating over three hundred,\r\nand over fifty horses, all of which are described as in a thriving\r\ncondition. At Cowpar and Winefred lakes towards the western part of the\r\ntrack explored and in Clearwater valley to the north, conditions seem\r\nalso most promising for stock-raising. It may be of interest to note\r\nhere that recent reports of investigations in Siberia, Mongolia and\r\nnorthern Manchuria by the Bureau of Plant Industry of the Department of\r\nAgriculture of the United States, give accounts of the discovery of\r\nthree varieties of yellow-flowered alfalfa which are found growing and\r\nthriving in a wild state under conditions of climate much more severe,\r\nboth as to cold in winter and snowfall, than are to be found in any part\r\nof northwestern Canada as far north as there are any claims made as to\r\npossibilities of settlement. It may therefore be considered reasonably\r\nprobable that whatever advantages alfalfa has over our native grasses as\r\nfodder are assured for all habitable parts of our north country.”\r\n\r\nAs to the district about Lac la Ronge, Mr. Crean says in his report of\r\n1908:—“Besides the mineral wealth supposed to be available there is\r\nalso considerable land to be found capable of being tilled.\r\n\r\n                          IT IS NO EXPERIMENT\r\n\r\nto endeavor to raise wheat in this section. It has already been done.\r\nStanley, or as it is sometimes called Stanley Mission, is worthy of\r\nspecial description. It appears that Stanley is one of the best known\r\nspots in the north. The village or settlement is situated on a most\r\npicturesque point jutting into Churchill river. The country surrounding\r\nit is rolling, and this adds considerably to the beauty of the locality.\r\nFrom an agricultural standpoint the land is good. The soil is a rich\r\nloam and the subsoil is sandy clay. The loam, however, attains a great\r\ndepth. I put one hole down almost four feet and had not then struck a\r\nsubsoil. This, however, was exceptional. Stanley’s fame rests altogether\r\non the energy and initiative of Reverend Mr. Hunt, a Church of England\r\nclergyman, and the founder of a Church of England Mission there about\r\n1851. Mr. Hunt, as far as I could ascertain, not only built the\r\ncelebrated and beautiful church, but also planted some wheat and barley.\r\nThis he found would grow successfully, and he established a small mill\r\nto grind the wheat. At first he used a hand mill, which is still\r\nstanding at the Mission House. Later on, however, he built a small water\r\npower mill and for a number of years this was in operation, used not\r\nonly by the Mission but also by the Hudson’s Bay Company.”\r\n\r\n                      WHAT A MISSIONARY IS DOING.\r\n\r\nOn the north shore of the bay at the southwest end of the lake, the\r\nChurch of England Mission have a large school not yet completed, and\r\nalso an open air saw mill. The Reverend Mr. Brown is in charge of the\r\nMission and is endeavouring to establish a farm in order to teach the\r\nnatives to work. He has some cattle, pigs, and poultry. Reverend Mr.\r\nBrown has a good garden, nothing in it suffering from frost. At Little\r\nHills, just at the mouth of Montreal river, wheat has been grown\r\nsuccessfully and Mr. Brown intends putting in a crop this year. I might\r\nhere be permitted to say that the Reverend Mr. Brown, who is materially\r\nassisted by his wife in his Mission work, is deserving of the most\r\nunstinted praise for his zeal and industry in the building up of the\r\nMission. Under somewhat disadvantageous circumstances he fills the\r\nseveral positions of minister of the gospel, farm instructor and\r\nmechanic to his flock, cheerfully and with good effect. The Hudson’s Bay\r\nCompany had a good garden last year, but most of the ground here is\r\nstony. Revillon Frères have a post here and they, too, raise all the\r\nvegetables they require.\r\n\r\nMr. Crean reports that on Deer lake (Montreal lake section) “just east\r\nof the narrows a white man lives and he has a first class garden. Around\r\nDeer lake the land is good and I see no difficulty in its development.\r\nThe soil at Deer lake is a good light loam inclined to be sandy, with a\r\nblue clay subsoil. Muskegs occur, but they are generally small. There is\r\nample hay everywhere. I fancy this country might profitably be surveyed\r\nand opened for settlement. I did not travel to the east of Montreal\r\nlake, but from information obtained there is not any great difference in\r\nthe country from the west side.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crean goes on to say that there has been no attempt at agriculture\r\nin Snake lake and Sandy river section. “The height of land dividing the\r\nwater sheds of Ile à la Crosse and Sandy river is not very high but is\r\nclearly marked by a clay ridge. This ridge has been burnt off in recent\r\nyears and is covered with fallen timber and brulé. A poplar growth is\r\nspringing up now. This part of the section should make good agricultural\r\ncountry. There is, however, a vast area of swamp in this section; I\r\ncannot say if it could be drained. Sandy river flows through vast hay\r\nmeadows. These are not too wet and are by no means swamps. Of course\r\nmost of the meadows would be improved by clearing of scrub bush.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oat field at La Plonge.]\r\n\r\nMr. Crean reports having seen wheat and oats growing at the Roman\r\nCatholic mission at the junction of Beaver and La Plonge rivers on\r\nSeptember 4, 1908. Mr. Crean says in his report:—“The wheat was a first\r\nattempt, but will be tried on a much larger scale this year. The small\r\npatch sown last year must have been put in late in the spring. It\r\nappeared well matured but frosted; this I fancy was due to its being\r\nplanted close to the river. The priest has cleared a good sized patch,\r\nperhaps about ten acres, which he intends sowing in wheat. The oats were\r\nsplendid and grew to a great height. The vegetables were especially\r\ngood. The variety astonished me. Almost every vegetable was represented\r\nand appeared to thrive. Potatoes, cabbage, cauliflower, lima beans,\r\ngreen peas, carrots, turnips, onions, lettuce, beets, parsnips, and\r\ntomatoes all growing splendidly.\r\n\r\n                      I NEVER SAW A BETTER GARDEN,\r\n\r\nand indeed I don’t remember seeing as good in the west. This garden is\r\nindicative of what can be done. The land around the mission is all good\r\nand easily cleared as it is covered with poplar.\r\n\r\nMr. Crean reports that in 1908 the priests at Ile à la Crosse had about\r\nthree acres in use as a garden. The Hudson’s Bay Company’s post had\r\nabout thirty-five acres ploughed and five acres in oats, which sell at\r\nthat point at a dollar per bushel. “The Hudson’s Bay Company grows\r\npotatoes for sale, but the native, being almost entirely a flesh eater,\r\nlooks on vegetables with contempt.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crean stated that there were some good gardens at Canoe lake. One\r\nChipewyan grew some barley but cut it too soon. At the southwest of\r\nCanoe lake the country rises considerably, and the soil is good. There\r\nis no settlement but the country is adapted to farming.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Potatoes at Buffalo river.]\r\n\r\n“At Buffalo river there is quite a large settlement of Chipewyans. They\r\ngrow quite a little barley and some oats. The Chipewyans and some\r\nhalf-breeds seem not to care for flour when left alone and so they grow\r\nbarley in preference to any other grain. It is easier to cook, being\r\njust thrown in soup. The land on the northerly side of Buffalo lake is\r\ngood but there are no people living there. The Chipewyans at Buffalo\r\nriver told me that they never heard of the crop of barley being a\r\nfailure for the past fifty years.”\r\n\r\nAt Methye lake, according to Mr. Crean’s report, there is a Roman\r\nCatholic Mission near the east end, and a priest, Father Pinard, is in\r\ncharge. He has a small garden and had a little patch of barley. Both did\r\nwell. At the Hudson’s Bay Company’s post, ten miles away, on the west\r\nside of the lake, there is a garden of about an acre. It looked\r\nsplendidly on September 17. The potato tops were not touched by frost.\r\nThe swamp through which Methye river flows, though very wet, produces\r\n\r\n                        A LARGE QUANTITY OF HAY.\r\n\r\nThe winter supply of feed for the cattle on Methye portage in its palmy\r\ndays was grown at Methye Post and at Buffalo lake at the mouth of Methye\r\nriver (hence called Bull’s House), but now there is no necessity for\r\nraising grain or fodder, the Hudson’s Bay Company having abandoned this\r\nroute to the Mackenzie about the time of the Riel Rebellion in 1885. Mr.\r\nCrean says:—“From conversation with the natives, the priest and the\r\nHudson’s Bay Company’s manager, I feel sure that the climate here would\r\nbe quite favourable to wheat raising. I am informed by the residents\r\nthat this section is not affected by early frosts, and the gardens which\r\nI saw certainly bear out their statements.\r\n\r\n“Pigs will, I firmly believe, thrive well in the north, and sheep will\r\nat any rate not suffer from the raids of the coyote.\r\n\r\n“Although the north may never seriously compete with the more southerly\r\nlatitudes in the wheat market, still, by judicious mixed farming, it\r\nwill eventually be equally productive and\r\n\r\n                 SUPPORT A DENSE, THRIVING POPULATION.\r\n\r\nMr. Crean thus described Clearwater river and valley:—“The Clearwater\r\nis a stream varying from one hundred to three hundred feet wide. It is\r\nfairly rapid, and generally about four feet deep. At several points\r\nalong the river there is a considerable fall where a substantial amount\r\nof power might be developed. The valley is from half a mile to three\r\nmiles wide, and generally contains magnificent soil. In the upper region\r\nthe timber is large and almost completely covers the valley. On the\r\nslopes of the valley, which are from two hundred to six hundred feet\r\nlong and rather steep, the timber still continues, poplar and some\r\nspruce, but once the bench land is reached there are some large\r\nopenings, and hay meadows to be found. When the railway reaches\r\nMcMurray, there is no doubt that a large agricultural settlement will\r\ntake possession of this beautiful valley.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crean writes in his report:—“The valley of Clearwater river would,\r\nin my opinion, be a magnificent cattle range, and should be a farming\r\ncountry. There are large open prairies, and the grass is splendid. Vetch\r\nand pea-vine grow everywhere. I was greatly impressed with Clearwater\r\nvalley; it is quite similar to North Saskatchewan valley. The soil is a\r\ngood loam with a sandy clay subsoil. I had ample opportunity to observe\r\nit carefully as the whole place in the vicinity of the portage is pitted\r\nwith prospect holes. The loam would be about a foot deep on an average.”\r\n\r\nAs to natural pasturage and hay in the area explored by him in 1908, Mr.\r\nCrean states:—“Along Big river in the southern portion of the tract is\r\n\r\n                      A SPLENDID RANCHING COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nHay abounds, and water and shelter is easily obtained. The country is\r\nprincipally open, dotted with bluffs of poplar, and hay is to be had\r\neverywhere. The grass cures here and the rolling hills would be blown\r\nclear of snow which would afford a winter range for stock almost equal\r\nto the Porcupine hills in southern Alberta. Farther north, however, the\r\ncountry is too flat until Methye portage is reached. The valley of\r\nClearwater river below Methye portage would furnish a cattle range that\r\nto my thinking would be hard to beat. I am informed that there is even a\r\nbetter cattle range in the valley of Pembina river, southwest of Methye\r\nportage, but I did not see it. Generally speaking, in my opinion mixed\r\nfarming would be the industry best adapted to the entire tract explored.\r\nEverywhere I travelled there was an abundance of hay and along the main\r\nroutes hay was stacked in quantities in many places but always with an\r\neye to proximity to the trail. Sometimes the meadows would be small but\r\nalways numerous. At Green lake there were particularly fine meadows, and\r\nI am told to the west of it is even better.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crean, in the report covering Green lake, Ile à la Crosse, Methye\r\nportage, Snake lake and Lac la Ronge sections, writes:—“It may be said\r\nthat the whole tract though not exactly fitted for agricultural\r\nsettlement throughout in its present state, is still capable of\r\nproducing large quantities of cereals and farm produce and supporting a\r\nlarge population. The over abundance of water and lack of natural\r\ndrainage, causing large swamps and muskegs, might in my opinion be\r\neasily remedied by clearing out some of the rapids on Churchill river\r\nand providing outlets for the surplus water where natural outlets are\r\nlacking.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crean has the following general remarks to make as to the soil of\r\nthe district covered by his explorations in 1908:—“The soil throughout\r\nthe district varies so much that a general report of it would be\r\ninadequate. In the southeasterly portion the soil is good, being a light\r\nloam, with a blue clay subsoil; towards the west the soil is light loam\r\nwith sandy clay subsoil. North of Montreal lake the soil is still good\r\nbut large stones occur more frequently till at Lac la Ronge rock outcrop\r\nis met with. There are of course fertile spots where the soil attains a\r\nconsiderable depth, but no large compact areas of land occur in the\r\nnortheastern part of the tract explored, except at Stanley, where\r\nperhaps three thousand acres of arable lands may be found in one block.\r\nTo the west of Lac la Ronge though rock outcrop continues; fertile spots\r\noccur more frequently, till at Trout lake there is no sign of rock. The\r\nsoil around Trout lake is light and rather sandy. Muskegs occur\r\nfrequently until Snake lake is reached. Sandy river flows through a\r\nlarge hay meadow, bounded on the west by a muskeg or peat bog, extending\r\nwesterly to Ile à la Crosse lake. This hay meadow varies in width from\r\none quarter of a mile to three miles. Abundance of good hay might be cut\r\nalong this river. This whole country between Snake lake and Ile à la\r\nCrosse lake,\r\n\r\n                             NEEDS DRAINAGE\r\n\r\nand there are few high spots in it except along the shore of the lakes\r\nor rivers. On the west side of Ile à la Crosse settlement there is\r\npractically no land fit at present for cultivation, the country being\r\nall low and almost a muskeg. I explored this side pretty thoroughly for\r\na distance of about sixty miles and found it to be practically all the\r\nsame, and almost the same level as the lake. Along what is termed Deep\r\nriver, connecting Ile à la Crosse lake and Little Buffalo lake, the\r\nbanks are higher and the land good, but this is only a fringe along the\r\nriver, seldom extending more than half a mile inland. These muskegs\r\ncould, of course, be easily drained. The soil around Buffalo lake is\r\nlight, but appears to be fertile. It is generally a light loam rather\r\ninclined to be sandy, with a sandy subsoil. In some places the soil is\r\nmuch heavier and is very fertile. Methye river flows through an immense\r\nswamp, which extends for miles on each side, no ridges being even in\r\nsight. At Methye lake the soil is very much better, being a heavy loam\r\nvarying from eighteen inches to almost any depth. Once the height of\r\nland at Methye portage is crossed on the portage, the whole country\r\ntowards the west takes on a far better aspect, and the soil appears to\r\nbe as good as could be desired.”\r\n\r\nWith special reference to climatic conditions, Mr. Crean, in the report\r\nof his explorations in 1908, says:—“The climate seems well adapted for\r\nraising any cereal. In fact, wherever wheat has been tried it has grown\r\nsuccessfully. At Methye portage, which is considerably north (Latitude\r\n56° 35′ 11′′), oats and barley have been grown. Wheat was not tried, but\r\nI feel sure it would grow successfully, notwithstanding the relatively\r\nhigh altitude. Methye portage has an altitude of about one thousand six\r\nhundred and seventy-seven feet as compared with one thousand three\r\nhundred and ninety-eight feet at Prince Albert. It is very much above\r\nthe general level of the country to the south and east.”\r\n\r\n                   LOW ALTITUDE AND LONG SUMMER DAY.\r\n\r\nMr. Crean quotes Professor John Macoun’s remark that “in considering the\r\npossibilities of agricultural development of all this modern country,\r\none fact to be kept steadily in mind is the advantage of the low\r\naltitude and the long day, which are fixed conditions and will always\r\nremain the same,” and gives a table verified by Doctor W. F. King, Chief\r\nAstronomer of the Department of the Interior, to compare the hours of\r\nsunshine on specified days during the summer at Ottawa, Prince Albert,\r\nand Methye portage. On May 1 the length of the day between sunrise and\r\nsunset at Ottawa (45 north latitude) is 14 hours, 4 minutes; at Prince\r\nAlbert (53 north latitude) 14 hours, 46 minutes; at Methye portage\r\n(56.36 north latitude) 15 hours, 12 minutes. June 20, the hours of\r\nsunshine are as follows:—Ottawa, 15 hours, 26 minutes; Prince Albert,\r\n16 hours, 42 minutes; Methye portage 17 hours, 30 minutes. For August 20\r\nthe figures are:—Ottawa, 13 hours, 42 minutes; Prince Albert, 14 hours,\r\n17 minutes; Methye portage, 14 hours, 36 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. Crean states that in 1908 “The first frost registered by my\r\nthermometer was on October 2, when the thermometer fell to 24 degrees\r\nFahr. I was at Methye portage on September 17, and the potato tops were\r\nnot frozen in the least. The garden was also quite untouched. Nor had I\r\nseen any frozen vegetables on the way up. . . . . . . The lakes began to\r\nfreeze on October 20, but remained open for perhaps two weeks, the\r\nweather turning quite mild again. There was not sufficient snow to\r\ntravel with dogs until November 20, and the snow was not deep until\r\nDecember 15. The rainfall in this district is ample, though not\r\nexcessive, and its uniformity from year to year is a valuable feature.\r\nAs far as I could learn the heaviest rains occur in the early summer\r\n\r\n                     JUST WHEN RAIN IS MOST NEEDED\r\n\r\nfor agricultural operations. The snow fall is not generally heavy,\r\nseldom exceeding eighteen inches, and, as with the rainfall, is\r\nuniform.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Green Lake settlement.]\r\n\r\nAs to agriculture, actual and possible, in Green lake district, Mr.\r\nCrean reports:—“At and around the Hudson’s Bay Company’s post on the\r\nnorth end of Green lake there is a considerable settlement of\r\nhalf-breeds. A Roman Catholic mission is established here. Revillon\r\nFrères have also a post. The priest has a good garden having all kinds\r\nof vegetables, and also a small fruit garden growing currants,\r\ngooseberries, raspberries and strawberries. These all thrive and mature.\r\nGreen lake is important as a stopping place for freighters in winter and\r\nconsequently large quantities of hay are stacked. Some oats and barley\r\nare grown but no real effort has been made to farm. Father Teston of the\r\nmission says that he has grown oats and barley for fifteen years in\r\nsuccession and so far has not had a failure. I interviewed a native\r\nnamed Morin, who said that he had grown potatoes, oats and barley in\r\nsmall quantities for thirty-five years and could not recall having ever\r\nhad a failure. He has never kept a record of when he sowed or when he\r\nharvested, neither has the Reverend Father. Morin owns thirty-five head\r\nof cattle and twelve head of horses. He has sown wheat on six or seven\r\noccasions and it always ripened. In his opinion there is no doubt that\r\nwheat could be raised anywhere in the locality. The ice in Green lake\r\ngoes out early and it is generally very late before it freezes. The\r\nsummers are always warm and there is ample rain. The gardens, which I\r\nsaw here, were certainly fine although they were not cared for as they\r\nshould have been. Weeds were allowed to grow in profusion.”\r\n\r\nIn his report of his explorations in 1909 along the west side of Green\r\nlake, Mr. Crean wrote:—“The crops were not very far advanced when I was\r\nthere, nor indeed did any resident sow grain to any extent. There was a\r\nsmall field of oats, a small field of barley and the usual gardens. The\r\ngardens, as is customary in the fur country, are neglected; but yet the\r\nvegetables seem to grow in profusion. Lettuce and radishes in fourteen\r\ndays grow from the seed to a size fit for table use. On Sunday, July 14,\r\nI saw some radishes one and one-half inches in diameter, fourteen days’\r\ngrowth.”\r\n\r\n                         MEADOW LAKE DISTRICT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oat field at Meadow lake.]\r\n\r\nMr. Crean reports most favourably on Meadow lake district, west of Green\r\nlake. He says:—“This section of the country is practically prairie and\r\ncontains, in my opinion, some of the very finest farm land in Canada.\r\nThe soil is exceedingly rich, there being in some portions twenty-four\r\ninches black loam, with clay subsoil. The open prairie country is\r\nperhaps twelve miles wide, and extends from Meadow lake almost to the\r\nfourth meridian. At the Indian Farm Instructor’s house there was a plot\r\nof about five acres of the finest of banner oats. I could not obtain any\r\ndata as to when these oats had been planted, but saw it on August 1,\r\nwhen it looked very well with good promise of ripening in plenty of time\r\nbefore the frosts. A settler named Evans is situated on the northern\r\nboundary of the Indian Reserve. In his garden I saw beans, tomatoes,\r\npeas, cauliflower, onions, carrots and parsnips, all doing very well.\r\nMr. Evans came into this country last winter, at least just before the\r\nspring, broke this land, harrowing it as well as possible, and planted a\r\ngarden on the sod on June 12. At Meadow lake there are two or three\r\nlarge herds of cattle which are thriving well. The grass at Meadow lake\r\ngrows perfectly, and is of the very finest quality for feed. The snow\r\nmay be deep here, but hay is so easily procured that I am of the opinion\r\nthat it would balance the scarcity of winter range. There was\r\nconsiderable disagreement amongst the people living in this country as\r\nto whether the grass really ripened. I satisfied myself later on (in\r\nOctober) that it really does ripen. The few settlers agree that two\r\nloads of hay will winter one animal, that is, two loads for each head of\r\nstock, whether yearling or full grown. Hay grows in such profusion that\r\ntwo loads to the animal could easily be obtained for even a large herd\r\nof cattle. There is little doubt that cattle fed and finished make\r\nbetter beef than range cattle, and the opportunity of procuring\r\nfinishing food (ensilage) is always present in the northern latitudes.\r\nHay here is by no means slough grass, but it is the\r\n\r\n                    FINEST OF NORTHERN UPLAND HAY.”\r\n\r\nProfessor John Macoun speaks in the highest terms of the nutriment\r\ncontained in this kind of hay. That there is ample of it is a certainty.\r\nAn old settler in this country is Cyprian Morin, who is a fine specimen\r\nof the old half-breed or native; born at Methye portage in 1834, he is\r\nnow as active as a man of thirty. Morin’s mother died four years ago at\r\nthe age of one hundred and nine years. She was at that time quite\r\ncapable of doing a good deal of work; in fact, I am told, attended to\r\nall the baking. Morin who runs a trading post and has raised barley and\r\ngarden vegetables every year for twenty years, has also eighty head of\r\ncattle and some thirty five horses; he has never tried wheat. He says\r\nthat the grass must ripen in this country (and it does), as the horses\r\nremain fat all winter. About eight miles to the west of Morin, a man\r\nnamed Fiddler has located, who has one hundred and fifty head of cattle\r\nand sixteen horses. Last winter his losses were extremely heavy. He told\r\nme that he lost seventy head of cattle, but said that it was because the\r\ncattle had not recovered from their travelling over the trail from\r\nBattleford. William LaRonde who also lives in this locality, his place\r\nbeing situated on Meadow lake, has fifty head of cattle, all doing well.\r\nReverend Father Cochin has lately opened a mission here, and has a\r\nrather nice little church, which is not yet finished. He has a good\r\ngarden this year.”\r\n\r\nWith reference generally, to the whole area of country explored by him\r\nin 1909, Mr. Crean stated in his report:—“In estimating the area of\r\nland available in its present state for agriculture, I do not wish it to\r\nbe understood that it is one large tract, but that ten million acres of\r\nland in large and small tracts out of the total is capable of producing\r\ncrops, which will enable settlers to make a comfortable livelihood. The\r\nland is almost entirely covered by a growth of small poplar. There are\r\nsome open places and a good deal of swamp. I will, however, refer to\r\nthis when dealing in detail with the tract. The climatic conditions\r\nprevailing throughout offer no obstacle to farming, and wherever\r\nexperiments in agriculture have been attempted they have always been\r\nsuccessful.”\r\n\r\n                        WHITEFISH LAKE DISTRICT.\r\n\r\nMr. Crean has this to say of Whitefish lake district (southwest of\r\nMethye lake), which he explored in 1909:—“This section lies almost upon\r\nthe height of land between Arctic ocean and Hudson bay. The land is\r\ndrier and of a better quality than that to be found at or around Buffalo\r\nlake; still, as is often the case in this north country, one finds\r\nmuskegs, almost impassable, either on top of, or very often half way up\r\na considerable hill. There are a great number of muskegs between Methye\r\nportage and Whitefish lake, the country being flat and in need of\r\ndraining. Whitefish lake is two hundred and forty feet higher than\r\nMethye lake, that portage which leads from it to Gypsy lake (eight miles\r\nin length) crossing the actual height of land. From Gypsy lake the water\r\nempties into the Clearwater, thence to the Athabaska and Arctic ocean.\r\nThe natives at Whitefish lake grow turnips, carrots, parsnips and\r\npotatoes, but lack seed of any other kind. The potatoes are completely\r\nworn out and change of seed is certainly necessary. Going southwest from\r\nWhitefish lake towards Pembina river, the land improves, some very fine\r\nsemi-open country being encountered. The Indians at Whitefish lake, who\r\ntravel a great deal, use horses rather than canoes. The horses which I\r\nsaw were not noticeable either for their condition or their breeding,\r\nthe former being extremely poor, and the latter being absent,—Indian\r\ncayuses of the common type.”\r\n\r\n                        WATERHEN LAKE DISTRICT.\r\n\r\nAs to Waterhen lake district north of and across Beaver river from\r\nMeadow lake district, Mr. Crean, in his 1909 report, states:—“The\r\ncountry surrounding Waterhen lake is for the most part good, especially\r\nthat portion which lies to the west of the lake, where there is some\r\nvery fine land. Hay grows everywhere, and though the country can\r\ngenerally be considered wooded there are large openings. The land around\r\nIsland river and Island lake (Lac des Isles) is included in this tract.\r\nFrom Island lake to Beaver river there is a portage of twelve miles,\r\nwhich passes through the finest semi-open country. Pea vine and vetch\r\nare found in abundance. This good land extends to the fourth meridian,\r\nperhaps beyond, but I did not go any farther. No crops are grown.\r\nIndians there depend entirely on game, fish and fur for a somewhat\r\nprecarious living. Waterhen river passes through a very large hay swamp\r\nshortly after flowing out of Waterhen lake. As it approaches Beaver\r\nriver, however, the land becomes more of a muskeg, and although there\r\nare ridges containing arable land, the whole country may be taken to be\r\nsorely in need of drainage.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crean did not go into the region north of Clearwater river, but he\r\nmade enquiries regarding it, and has the following to say about it in\r\nhis report:—“The country to the north of the Clearwater has not been\r\nexplored even by fur-traders or Indians. Occasionally one meets a\r\nhalf-breed who has travelled through it, and the rumour current amongst\r\nthe fur-traders is that the country contains nothing but small lakes,\r\njackpine and rock outcrop. Still, the Indians who trap in this country\r\nkill nothing but beaver, which, it is well known, live upon poplar;\r\ntherefore I concluded the country must be a poplar country and of some\r\npromise agriculturally.”\r\n\r\n                        NORTH OF THE CHURCHILL.\r\n\r\nMost of the information we possess as to the most northern portion of\r\nthe region under review, namely the country north of Churchill river, is\r\ncontained in the report by Mr. J. B. Tyrrell of the exploration\r\nconducted by him in 1892. This report covers an area of about sixty\r\nthousand square miles, bounded on the south by Churchill and Clearwater\r\nrivers; on the west by the lower portion of Athabaska river; on the\r\nnorth by Athabaska lake, Stone river, with its expansions, Black and\r\nHatchet lakes, Wollaston lake and Cochrane or Ice river; on the east by\r\nthe lower part of Cochrane river, Reindeer lake and Reindeer river. It\r\nlies between north latitudes 55° 20′ and 59° 37′, and east longtitude\r\n101° and 111° 30′.\r\n\r\nMr. Tyrrell, in his report, gives some interesting information as to the\r\ngreat lakes and the rivers which are such conspicuous topographical\r\nfeatures of this area.\r\n\r\nReindeer lake, from which Reindeer river flows, has an area of about two\r\nthousand two hundred square miles, and an elevation above the sea of one\r\nthousand one hundred and fifty feet. Its water is very pure and clear.\r\n\r\nWollaston lake is a large body of beautifully clear transparent water\r\nlying in a general north-and-south direction, with a greatest length of\r\nabout fifty-five miles and an approximate area of eight hundred square\r\nmiles. Though smaller than Reindeer lake, it is very similar to it in\r\ngeneral character. Very many rocky islands rise abruptly out of its\r\nclear blue water. Wollaston lake is the dividing line between the waters\r\nflowing to Churchill river and those flowing to the Mackenzie, for it is\r\nnot only drained by Cochrane river, toward the Churchill, but Stone\r\nriver flows from its northwestern side, towards Lake Athabaska.\r\n\r\nLake Athabaska lies in a general east-northeasterly and\r\nwest-southwesterly direction, its southwestern end being in northern\r\nAlberta. This lake has a greatest length of one hundred and ninety-five\r\nmiles, a greatest width of thirty-five miles, a shore-line of four\r\nhundred and twenty-five miles and a total area of two thousand eight\r\nhundred and fifty square miles. Its depth has not yet been determined.\r\n\r\nCree lake is a large elongated body of pure transparent water lying in a\r\ngeneral northeast and southwest direction, with a greatest length of\r\nforty-nine miles and a width as yet undetermined. Cree river discharges\r\nits waters towards Lake Athabaska.\r\n\r\nGeikie river is, as far as is known, the principal tributary of\r\nWollaston lake. It rises in some small lakes near the source of Foster\r\nriver, and flows northeastward through a thickly drift-covered country.\r\nFor long stretches it is straight and without current, giving the\r\nappearance of a wide, quiet river, or a chain of long narrow lakes.\r\n\r\nThe principal tributaries of the Churchill river on the north are\r\nMudjatik, Haultain, Foster and Reindeer rivers. Mudjatik river is a\r\nswift, winding stream about eighty miles in length, generally flowing in\r\na shallow channel through a sandy plain, in the bottom of a wide\r\ndepression between ridges of granite. It is obstructed by comparatively\r\nfew rapids, and these are for the most part over ridges of boulders.\r\n\r\nMr. Tyrrell, and his assistant, Mr. Dowling, considered the whole of the\r\nfar northern part of this region as\r\n\r\n                 ABSOLUTELY UNSUITABLE FOR AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\nIt is mentioned, in the report, that, under the trees at White Spruce\r\nrapid, on Geikie river, pembina berries, raspberries, etc., were growing\r\nin profusion in July, but no areas of arable land were found. All\r\nreferences to the soil are unfavourable, these for instance:—“There is\r\nno soil of any value for agricultural purposes along Mudjatik river.”\r\n\r\n“The country surrounding Cree river is sandy and very barren.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN.\r\n\r\n                   Tree Growth and Timber Resources.\r\n\r\n   A Rare Bit of Sylvan Beauty.—Ash-Leaved Maples Successfully Grown\r\n     From Seed.—Notes by The Way on Available Water Powers.—Much\r\n     Country Covered with Small Timber Not Generally of Commercial\r\n     Value.—Some Areas of Good Timber Which Will be Invaluable To\r\n     the Settlers.\r\n\r\nThe wide belt of territory north of the Saskatchewan as far northward as\r\nChurchill and Clearwater rivers, is pre-eminently a wooded country, its\r\nresources in the way of timber being very valuable, and its\r\nforest-clothed mounds, river valleys and lake basins imparting to it a\r\nbeautiful park-like appearance in marked contrast to the more monotonous\r\nscenery of the great prairie country south of the Saskatchewan. There is\r\nlittle doubt that the scenic beauties of the region, by attracting\r\ntravellers, will, when there is railway communication, contribute\r\nmaterially to the development of the natural resources of this extremely\r\npromising portion of the, as yet, unexploited northwest. Included in\r\nthis territory is the famous scenery of Methye portage, which for\r\nupwards of a century has excited the admiration of explorers and\r\ntravellers as perhaps the most superb natural panorama of forest scenery\r\nin North America. Of the many books and diaries of men who have had the\r\nprivilege of enjoying this view, there is not one which omits to pay\r\ntribute to its beauty.\r\n\r\nAlexander Mackenzie, in the account of his trip of 1789, describes the\r\nheight of land overlooking the Clearwater from Methye portage as\r\ncommanding “a most extensive, romantic and ravishing prospect. From here\r\nthe eye looks down on the course of the little river, by some called\r\nSwan river, by others Clearwater or Pelican river, beautifully\r\nmeandering for upwards of thirty miles. The valley, which is at once\r\nrefreshed and adorned by it, is about three miles in breadth and is\r\nconfined by two lofty ridges of equal height, displaying a most\r\nbeautiful intermixture of wood and lawn, and stretching on till the blue\r\nmist obscures the prospect. Some parts of the inclining heights are\r\ncovered with stately forests, relieved by promontories of the finest\r\nverdure, where the elk and buffalo find pasture. These are contrasted by\r\nspots where fire has destroyed the woods and left a dreary void behind\r\nit. . . . . . . .”\r\n\r\nMackenzie, further, declares this “enchanting scenery” to be a\r\n“wonderful display of uncultivated nature.”\r\n\r\n                    MOST DELIGHTFUL NATURAL SCENERY.\r\n\r\nHarmon, writing in 1800, gives us the following as his impression of\r\nthis view:—“About a mile from this end of the portage is a hill, which\r\ntowers majestically to the height of a thousand feet above the plain\r\nbelow, and which commands a most extensive and delightful prospect. Two\r\nlofty and extensive ridges enclose a valley about three miles in width,\r\nwhich stretches far as the eye can reach. Little river, which is also,\r\nby different persons, denominated Swan, Clearwater, or Pelican river,\r\nwinds in a most delightful manner along this charming valley. The\r\nmajestic forests, which wave upon these ridges, the delightful verdure\r\nof the intervening lawn, and the beautiful stream which wanders along\r\nthrough it, giving a pleasing variety to the scene, until these objects\r\nbecome blended with the horizon, form, on the whole, the most delightful\r\nnatural scenery that I ever beheld.”\r\n\r\nSir John Franklin, in his account of his expeditions, writing of the\r\nview from the heights above the Clearwater at Methye portage, describes\r\nit as “the most picturesque and romantic prospect we had yet seen in\r\nthis country. Two ranges of high hills run parallel to each other for\r\nseveral miles until the faint blue haze hides their particular\r\ncharacters, when they slightly change their course and are lost to the\r\nview.”\r\n\r\nCaptain (later Sir) George Back makes enthusiastic references to this\r\nbeautiful view, for instance the following:—“A thousand feet below, the\r\nsylvan landscape lay spread before us, to the extent of thirty-six\r\nmiles, in all the wild luxuriance of its summer clothing. Even the most\r\njaded of the party, as he broke from the gloom of the wood on this\r\nenchanting scene, seemed to forget his weariness, and halted\r\ninvoluntarily with his burden\r\n\r\n                         TO GAZE FOR A MOMENT,\r\n\r\nwith a sort of wondering admiration, on a spectacle so novel and\r\nmagnificent. . . . . . . . . . . There is something appalling in the\r\nvastness of a solitude like this.”\r\n\r\nSir George Simpson, in his narrative, speaks of “that noble view of\r\nClearwater river which has been drawn with so much truth and beauty by\r\nSir George Back.”\r\n\r\nBishop Tache, in the accounts of his travels, writes of the\r\nClearwater:—“This delightful little stream, rising to the east of\r\nMethye portage has, up to the present time, and in spite of the\r\ndifficulties of navigation, enjoyed almost the exclusive privilege of\r\nsupplying a route to Athabaska-Mackenzie. On descending the heights of\r\nMethye portage one takes boat on this little river which, in order to\r\nkeep the traveller in the midst of the beauties it presents to his view,\r\nplaces obstructions in the way, necessitating the portages of White Mud,\r\nthe Pines, Bigstone, the Horse and the Cascades.”\r\n\r\nThe early travellers were also impressed with the fine trees in this\r\nsection of the northwest, and occasionally mention extra fine groves\r\nwhich attracted their attention. For instance, Simpson speaks of “firs\r\nof great size” on a projecting point in Methye lake, and, referring to\r\none of his camps in Clearwater valley, says:—“One of the pines, under\r\nshelter of which we took up our night’s lodgings, measured three yards\r\nin girth at five feet from the ground.”\r\n\r\nAs in other parts of Canada, forest fires have wrought dreadful havoc in\r\nparts of this belt, but there still remains considerable areas of good\r\ntimber.\r\n\r\nThe Venerable Archdeacon McKay, in his examination before the Senate\r\ncommittee of 1907, stated that as to the country around Lac la Ronge\r\nthere is timber all through it, wherever it has not been destroyed by\r\nfires. He explained that he put up a sawmill operated by water power at\r\nLac la Ronge in 1906. The logs that are sawn there are the kind of\r\ntimber found in that part of the country. They average seventeen logs to\r\nthe thousand feet. They would be logs fourteen or fifteen feet long. The\r\ndiameter would be about two feet across at the butt—good, large logs,\r\nclean timber, very much the same timber as at Prince Albert. This good\r\ntimber is scattered all over the country, sometimes for miles. It\r\ndepends on the nature of the country.\r\n\r\nAsked how far this timber area would outskirt to the east, west and\r\nnorth, the Archdeacon replied he would say that kind of country extended\r\nall the way through right down to Lac la Ronge, and down all the way to\r\nthe border of the province. Although he had not been through it, he had\r\ntravelled backwards and forwards on it a good deal, visited Indian camps\r\nand so on, and it is very much the same kind of timber all through. In\r\nsome places it is muskeg, and in some places heavy timber. Reindeer lake\r\nis not north of the tree limit. There are trees there, but they are\r\nsmall. They do not grow so large as farther south. It is a good way\r\nnorth of Reindeer lake before the barren grounds are reached. The\r\nArchdeacon had never been farther north than Reindeer lake.\r\n\r\n                       TIMBER ABOUT LAC LA RONGE.\r\n\r\nMr. Tyrrell describes the country immediately north of the Saskatchewan\r\nas a thickly wooded belt, “which contains a large quantity of timber,\r\nchiefly white spruce, trees up to eighteen inches in diameter. It is a\r\nwooded country with trees from twelve to eighteen inches in diameter,\r\ntall with clean trunks—good, nice timber. Of course, the timber does\r\nnot grow as large on high, dry, sandy ridges as it grows in the valleys.\r\nMost of the timber is in good soil in the valley bottoms, but there is\r\nmore or less land all over. The poplar and birch affects the higher\r\nland, and the spruce and hemlock the valleys.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dowling states that the sides of Green lake are “densely wooded with\r\npoplar and spruce.”\r\n\r\n                         PIONEER ARBORICULTURE.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of his visit to Ile à la Crosse lake, Mr. Dowling states in his\r\nreport:—“Some ash-leaved maples had been planted in the garden of the\r\nHudson’s Bay Company’s post, which are now from ten to fifteen feet\r\nhigh, quite healthy and bearing abundant seed.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Dowling’s report “The timber in the rocky country\r\nbordered by the southern shore of Lac la Ronge is not large or abundant.\r\nSouthward there is some improvement, and large individual spruce trees\r\noccur occasionally. The ‘lob sticks’ at Big Stone, Hudson’s Bay\r\nCompany’s post, are fine examples of these. On Montreal river, small\r\nBanksian pine cover the eastern slope of the sandy plateau. No large\r\ntimber, spruce or pine, is seen till near the lake, where at the\r\nsouthern end some groves of large spruce occur. On the watershed south\r\nof Montreal and Deer lakes the largest timber is seen. Here the\r\nformation of the country is evidently morainic, but southward the\r\ncountry slopes gently towards Saskatchewan river.”\r\n\r\n                    SOME MERCHANTABLE TIMBER AREAS.\r\n\r\nMr. Crean reports that a considerable quantity of merchantable spruce\r\ntimber is to be found in Methye lake section. There is some remarkably\r\nfine spruce along the banks of Whitefish river, and it extends in not\r\nvery dense forest across to Methye lake, a distance of about eight\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nSummarizing the results of his explorations in 1908, Mr. Crean\r\nreports.—“Although numerous prairie openings occur, this tract may be\r\nspoken of as practically covered with small timber not generally of any\r\ncommercial value. The poplar is the principal growth, and, following the\r\nrule so well known throughout the western prairie country, indicates\r\ngood land. Some spruce is found and large quantities of small second\r\ngrowth jackpine. There is some tamarack. There is, of course, no white\r\nor red pine. The poplar in some places would make fine pulpwood or\r\nbarrel staves. Generally speaking it is of no commercial value. There\r\nare several small groves of good spruce along Churchill river, and at\r\nMethye portage there is a large quantity of good spruce. Along Whitefish\r\nriver the timber is large and of good quality. On both the east and west\r\nside of Green lake some good timber is found but it is scattered.\r\nGenerally there is ample timber for settlers’ use, but not enough to\r\nsupply any lumber industry.\r\n\r\n“Throughout this district there are many points where a large amount of\r\nwater power could be developed, and there are numerous small power\r\nsites. The district might be utilized so as to create great industrial\r\ncentres. The great advantage of the numerous water powers is the fact\r\nthat sufficient power can be obtained at many points to supply the needs\r\nof a fair sized community. On almost every stream there are sites where\r\nsmall powers could be easily developed and grist mills, saw mills,\r\nlighting and pumping plants could be operated at the minimum of expense.\r\nI did not gauge or measure the possibilities of any of the water powers,\r\nbut made rough estimates of a few prominent ones. On Beaver river at\r\nwhat is termed Grand rapids probably\r\n\r\n              TEN THOUSAND HORSE POWER COULD BE DEVELOPED.\r\n\r\nRapid river, which enters the Churchill about seven miles below Stanley,\r\nfalls seventy feet in one cascade. This should afford a large amount of\r\npower. Churchill river between Ile à la Crosse lake and Knee lake, a\r\ndistance of about twenty-five miles, has a fall of eighty feet. This\r\nfall is practically all in three rapids, all of which have sharp\r\ndescents. At one rapid there is a cascade eight feet high. All the\r\ntributaries on the north side of the Churchill afford ample opportunity\r\nof development of power. Mudjatik river is a series of water-falls.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crean, in his report of 1909, says:—“Waterhen river is very rapid,\r\nand along it are several small falls and steep descents. These would be\r\nample to develop power for a small community, but not enough for any\r\ncommercial proposition. On Clearwater river occurs one of the best\r\ncommercial water powers which I have seen. It could be easily and\r\ninexpensively developed.”\r\n\r\nAll reports agree in saying that there are numerous water powers\r\nsusceptible of development throughout the area under review, but there\r\nis not much detailed information given on this point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Prairie along Clearwater river.]\r\n\r\nMr. Crean reports that along Whitefish river there is a considerable\r\nquantity of good tamarack, but explains that although this timber would\r\nbe extremely useful to any settler going into the country, he did not\r\nthink there was sufficient for any commercial project. There is a\r\nconsiderable quantity of timber north of Waterhen lake and river. There\r\nare several scattered clumps of fine spruce in this locality which are\r\npassed on the string of small portages when one is travelling from\r\nWaterhen lake to Island river. The diameter would average perhaps twelve\r\ninches, but running up to twenty-four inches.\r\n\r\n                        THE NATIVE TIMBER TREES.\r\n\r\nMr. Crean incorporates in his report the following description, with\r\ncomparative values, of the most common kinds of timber found in the\r\nnorth:—\r\n\r\n“(1). White Spruce (_Picea canadensis_ (Mill) B., S. & P.)\r\n\r\nThe wood is light, soft, not very strong, straight grained, light\r\nyellow, with hardly distinguishable sapwood. This is the best tree for\r\nlumber purposes in the northern forest, and is also one of the best for\r\npulpwood. It usually grows on higher ground than the black spruce.\r\n\r\n“(2) Black Spruce (_Picea mariana_ (Mill), B., S. & P.)\r\n\r\nThe wood resembles closely that of the white spruce, and as lumber or\r\npulpwood no distinction is made between them. The wood has a slight red\r\ntinge and has paler sapwood. The black spruce grows usually in muskegs\r\nand low places and owing to the coldness of the soil does not grow fast,\r\nand is usually small, not usually over six or eight inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n“(3). Jackpine (_Pinus Banksiana_, Am.)\r\n\r\nThe wood is light, soft, not very strong, close grained and dark, nearly\r\nbrown in colour, with light thick sapwood. This tree is used mostly for\r\nrailway ties and fuel, but is manufactured into lumber to some extent.\r\nIt is not equal in colour or smoothness to the wood of the spruce. It is\r\nused for pulp, but has not so fine a fibre or colour as the spruce.\r\n\r\n“(4). Tamarack (_Larix americana_, Michx.)\r\n\r\nThe wood is light brown, heavy, hard, strong, rather coarse grained and\r\nvery durable. It is used for railway ties, posts and dimension timbers.\r\nIt is not sawn into lumber, being more useful for other purposes, and is\r\nnot used for pulp.\r\n\r\n“(5). Poplar, Aspen or White Poplar (_Populus tremuloides_, Michx.)\r\n\r\nThe wood is light brown with almost white sapwood. It is smooth and\r\neasily worked. It is used for pulp and is cut into lumber for inside\r\nfinish. As it is a widely extended and quick growing tree it is used\r\nlargely for fuel. Next to the spruce it is the most valuable tree for\r\npulp. It is manufactured largely into finer grades of paper by the soda\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n“(6). Balsam or Black Poplar (_Populus balsamifera_).\r\n\r\nThe wood is light brown, with thick sapwood. It is rather coarse and not\r\nstrong. It is chiefly used for fuel, though sometimes cut into boards\r\nwhere other lumber is not available. It is not so valuable as the aspen\r\npoplar.\r\n\r\n“(7). Birch (_Betula papyrifera_, Marsh).\r\n\r\nThe wood is light, strong, tough, hard, very close grained, light brown,\r\ntinged with red, with thick, nearly white sapwood. It is used for\r\nspools, lasts and turned work generally. Birch fibre is short and\r\nbrittle, and not easily bleached, and is not suitable for pulp.”\r\n\r\n                        REINDEER LAKE AND RIVER.\r\n\r\nThe district north of Churchill and Clearwater rivers, authorities\r\nagree, is only thinly wooded, the growth becoming smaller towards the\r\nnorthern limit. According to Mr. Tyrrell, the banks of Churchill river\r\nfrom Methye portage to the north of Reindeer river are low and thickly\r\nwooded with spruce and poplar. White spruce (_Picea Alba_) forms some\r\ngroves of fair size in the bottom lands along Reindeer river near\r\nChurchill river, but farther north it is rarely seen except in some\r\nparticularly favorable localities. One small isolated grove of white\r\nspruce was found in a high sandy island in Hatchet lake, standing out\r\nconspicuously in the midst of the surrounding forest of small black\r\nspruce. Poplar (_Populus tremuloides_) and Birch (_Betula papyrifera_)\r\nare the only remaining trees of any importance. They are chiefly found\r\nin the vicinity of Churchill river, though small scattered trees were\r\nseen on the banks of Stone river. The rocky shores and islands of\r\nReindeer lake are generally thinly covered with a sparse growth of\r\nsmall, black spruce. The irregular shores of Wollaston lake are chiefly\r\ncomposed of thinly wooded, rocky hills. Geikie river flows between low,\r\nsparsely-wooded banks. The banks of Mudjatik river are thinly wooded\r\nwith Banksian pine and spruce. As to Cree river, surrounding country is\r\nsandy and very barren supporting but a scanty growth of black spruce and\r\nBanksian pine, with very little underbrush. Some fine, large, white\r\nspruce were noticed at spots on Geikie river.\r\n\r\n                          NEAR LAKE ATHABASKA.\r\n\r\nMr. Tyrrell mentions that along the northeast shore of Lake Athabaska,\r\n“Some good white spruce, up to fourteen inches in diameter, is growing\r\non the points.”\r\n\r\nMr. Tyrrell, before the Senate committee of 1907, in speaking of the\r\nforests of the country north of the Churchill, explained that far in the\r\nnorth there is the tract of country that has no trees on it; then a belt\r\nof country from one to two hundred miles in width, with small Banksian\r\npine, spruce, larch, poplar and some white birch. He would not consider\r\nany of those woods valuable for timber purposes, except locally. They\r\nwould serve for pulpwood, but the growth is not thick. Still over\r\nconsiderable areas there might, of course, be a large quantity of timber\r\nfor pulpwood. In that belt the trees would average probably six inches.\r\nOccasionally you would find some a good deal larger. The poplar grows on\r\nthe drier lands. It is not an indication of good land in an extremely\r\nnorthern country. It indicates a dry, sandy soil, but further south it\r\nindicates excellent soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN.\r\n\r\n                           Economic Minerals.\r\n\r\n   A Large Amount of Iron Ore in the Northeastern Corner of the\r\n     Region, on the North East Side of Lake Athabaska.—Indications\r\n     Favourable for the Discovery of Coal.—Nickel and Traces of\r\n     Cobalt on Reindeer lake.—Medicinal Waters.—Bituminous Springs\r\n     and Pit Coal on Cree river.—Tar Sands Near Buffalo lake.\r\n\r\nIn the report of his explorations in 1892 and 1893, Mr. J. B. Tyrrell\r\nnotes the occurrence of several areas of Huronian quartzite along the\r\nnortheast side of Lake Athabaska. In one case, he states:—“At a\r\ndistance of a mile and a half from this island (four miles and a half\r\neast of Beaver Lodge island) in a direction north 66° east, a\r\nconspicuous red hill rises one hundred and twenty-five feet above the\r\nwater, its abrupt red cliff standing out boldly towards the southwest.\r\nOn its northeastern side, at its base, it is composed of thinly fissile\r\nquartzose schist, very much reddened, striking north 30° west, and\r\ndipping south 60° west, at an angle of 10°. Farther up the side of the\r\nhill the rock is a quartzite, interbedded with layers of hematite, which\r\nin some places forms the larger part of the mass. The summit of the\r\nhill, several hundred yards in length, is composed of a highly hematitic\r\nquartzite, mingled with a large quantity of limonite, especially on the\r\nhigher points. In places the rock is a conglomerate, with quartz\r\npebbles, and a matrix of limonite. Other similar red hills can be seen\r\nin the distance on the strike of the rocks, and the total amount of iron\r\nhere and in the vicinity is doubtless very large.”\r\n\r\nMr. J. B. Tyrrell, before the Senate committee of 1907, stated that from\r\na line at Cumberland House, on Saskatchewan river, northwestward to\r\nChurchill river, and westward along Churchill river, the country to the\r\nsouth is underlaid by the more recent clay rocks of the plains, and the\r\nmineral wealth that is to be looked for there is\r\n\r\n                             COAL AND IRON.\r\n\r\nHe had considerable confidence in both those most useful products being\r\nfound in that country. Coal is found on Saskatchewan river at Edmonton,\r\nand on Pembina river, west of Edmonton, and there are several more\r\noutcroppings of coal down Saskatchewan river as far as Prince Albert.\r\nMost of the country north of Saskatchewan river had not been explored\r\nfor coal. It is a country of gentle slopes covered with grass and wood,\r\nand the coal outcropping in such a country is certain to be covered.\r\nThere is no possibility of seeing it as a natural outcrop. It has to be\r\nlooked for, but it has not been looked for in that country sufficiently\r\nto find it, so he was perfectly confident that the same seams that\r\noutcrop on the Saskatchewan, in the west at all events, would be traced\r\nmuch further north.\r\n\r\nWriting in his report of his survey of the west shore of Reindeer lake,\r\nMr. Dowling states:—“From Priest’s point (proceeding southward), the\r\nlake gradually narrows from a minimum width of four miles, to a narrow\r\ninlet less than a mile wide at the outlet, and the course of this part\r\nlies very nearly southwest and northeast following in a general way the\r\nstrike of the rocks. A band of dark mica-schists is crossed, reaching\r\nfrom near Priest’s point to twenty miles southwest, and along the course\r\nfollowed through the islands many small dykes of a quartzose\r\nfine-grained granite were found, in which iron pyrites is freely\r\ndeveloped. The beds of fine-grained gneiss on Camping island, ten miles\r\nsouth from Priest’s point, are also found with many veins of pyrites and\r\non the hill in the centre of the island many of the beds are very much\r\nrusted and decomposed. The pyrites are found to contain a small\r\npercentage of\r\n\r\n                      NICKEL AND TRACES OF COBALT.\r\n\r\nAt the north side of a small creek on the west shore, southwest from\r\nCamping island, the Indians report a soft soapstone or serpentinous rock\r\nfrom which they make pipes, but a visit to the locality did not result\r\nin finding this rock, which was then said to be obtained in small pieces\r\nfrom the shore and generally under the water. The rock there was,\r\nhowever, a light green sericite-schist, and it is possible that\r\nunfoliated or less cleavable portions of this might be soft enough for\r\nthe purpose named. The stratigraphical relations of this band with the\r\nsurrounding gneisses, could not in the time at the disposal of the party\r\nbe made out, so that it is problematical whether this may be a small\r\narea of highly altered Huronian beds or not. The next rock occurring to\r\nthe south is a dark garnetiferous gneiss, followed by reddish granitic\r\ngneiss to the outlet of the lake.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dowling mentions that in descending Reindeer river his attention was\r\nattracted by the red colouring of a hill near the river, below the mouth\r\nof Stump river. He states:—“On a nearer view, this red colouring is\r\nfound to be due to the debris of a decomposed band occupying the crest\r\nof the ridge. The rock has been very highly charged with iron oxides and\r\npyrites. The strike of the beds is south 10° east, with dip eastward at\r\nangles varying from 60° to 80°. Several large seams of red granite cut\r\ninto the hill and break up the beds somewhat.\r\n\r\n“A section of the hill shows a light, coarse gneiss near the bottom,\r\nwith a dark mica-schist, followed by a bed of light, rusty coloured\r\ngneiss having a thickness of about five feet. This in some places seems\r\nto have been very rich in pyrites and is weathered out to a reddish\r\nochre. The outcrop is just below the crest of the ridge, and from it the\r\nochre falling down, stains the whole face of the hill. Above, on the\r\nsummit, the rock is mostly a dark-red gneiss.”\r\n\r\nArchbishop Clut, examined before the Senate committee of 1888, stated\r\nthat he had seen sulphur springs on Clearwater river. Asked if he had\r\never heard of the existence of valuable minerals in any part of the\r\ncountry northeast of Lake Athabaska, Bishop Clut explained that he had\r\nseen a man named McCarthy, at Fond du Lac, Lake Athabaska, who told him\r\nthat he had discovered gold, but as he was not an educated man, the\r\nbishop did not know whether he was mistaken or not. The man said he\r\nwould not show it to anybody, but that he was almost sure that he had\r\nfound a gold mine. Nobody had brought to him specimens of gold, silver\r\nor anything of that kind from that region.\r\n\r\n                    BITUMINOUS SPRINGS AND PIT COAL.\r\n\r\nChief Factor A. McDonald chronicles in his journal having passed\r\nbituminous springs on Cree river, south of Lake Athabaska, just above\r\nthe junction of the Pierre au Calumet or Pipestone river (McLeod’s\r\n“Peace River”). He also reports having passed, the same day, “Large\r\nstrata of pit coal all along either side of the river.”\r\n\r\nMr. Alfred Von Hamerstein informed the Senate committee of 1907 that “on\r\nClearwater river there are first class medicinal springs. The natives\r\nhave been using the water right along, and it acts very well on the\r\nbowels. It is like the well known Hunyadi mineral water. It is a very\r\nnice, picturesque country, and the natives go up there and doctor\r\nthemselves.”\r\n\r\nIn the course of his examination before the Senate committee of 1907,\r\nMayor Cook, of Prince Albert, explained that nobody in the region north\r\nof the Saskatchewan bothers about the coal. Coal had been discovered at\r\nLac La Ronge—there was no doubt about that. Good samples had been\r\nbrought in, but nobody bothered with it yet because wood was so\r\nplentiful.\r\n\r\nW. F. Bredin, M.L.A., stated before the Senate committee of 1907, that\r\non his way from McMurray to Prince Albert, he found that the tar sands\r\nappeared on Buffalo lake, which is on the Churchill system of water, and\r\nthat, in his opinion, showed that the tar sands are both on the\r\nMackenzie water system and on the Churchill system, on both sides of the\r\ndivide there.\r\n\r\nMr. Crean in his 1908 report says:—“At the narrows between Little\r\nBuffalo lake and Buffalo lake, there is a tar sand outcrop. The Indians\r\nuse it to pitch their canoes.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crean also says:—“Lac la Ronge district is claimed to have great\r\npossibilities as a mineral district. The Laurentian range of rock crops\r\nout here and is easily traced to the northwest. Whether this outcrop\r\nreally contains mineral of economic value is still unsettled. Numerous\r\nclaims have been staked at Nickel island in Lac la Ronge and on the\r\nmainland close by, also on Churchill river above Stanley. I had not time\r\nto prospect the country, but from casual observation I should think that\r\nit would repay a closer investigation. The vein on Nickel island is very\r\ndistinct and about eighteen inches wide on the outcrop. Several small\r\ncompanies have been formed and development work in a limited way is\r\nprogressing.”\r\n\r\nSo far there has been very little systematic prospecting for economic\r\nminerals in the portion of the province of Saskatchewan north of the\r\nriver of that name, but the people of Prince Albert and Battleford and\r\nthe pioneers settled in the wilderness north of those towns, have for\r\nyears believed that coal, iron and other minerals will be found in the\r\nvicinity; trappers, traders and Indians often return from the wilderness\r\nwith stories of mineral discoveries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN.\r\n\r\n                  Game, Fur-Bearing Animals and Fish.\r\n\r\n   “So Fine a Country for the Chase That It May Be Regarded as an\r\n     Extensive Preserve.”—The Wood Buffalo Used To Roam Over It, but\r\n     Do Not Now.—Moose and Caribou Plentiful.—The Indians Kill the\r\n     Moose for Their Hides.—Fish of Various Kinds in Abundance.—\r\n     Sturgeon That Weigh a Hundred Pounds.—One Indian Killed\r\n     Eighteen Moose During One Season.\r\n\r\nAs fish has always been the staple food of the inhabitants of that part\r\nof the province of Saskatchewan north of the river of that name, and the\r\nfur trade their only industry, it goes without saying that the country\r\nabounds in fish and game. A very few quotations from travellers and\r\nexplorers is all that is required to give an idea of the species of fish\r\nand animals to be found in this region, and of their occurrence.\r\n\r\nIn his account of his passage through the Clearwater country, Simpson\r\nwrites:—“This is a fine country for the chase, and so little frequented\r\nin winter, that it may be regarded as an extensive preserve. We saw\r\nthree moose deer on the top of one of the hills, and their tracks and\r\nthose of the wood buffalo were numerous in every direction. The valley\r\nof the river is entirely sheltered from the inclement north and\r\nnorthwest winds, but its exposure to the east usually rendered the snow\r\ndeep and soft, as we found to our cost. . . . . . . . . Just before\r\nbreakfasting we saw, on the northern hills, a large moose, and a band of\r\nfive wood buffalos sunning their fat sides—a sight sufficient to make\r\nthe mouths of the pemmican eaters water, but they were beyond our reach,\r\nand, taking the alarm, quickly disappeared. The declivities of the hills\r\nseemed, as we passed along, completely chequered with the tracks of\r\nthese and smaller animals.”\r\n\r\nMr. H. J. Moberly, chief trader of the Hudson’s Bay Company at Rapid\r\nriver, (Lac la Ronge) Cumberland district, forwarded the Senate\r\ncommittee of 1887 evidence in writing regarding animal life in the far\r\nnorthwest. He explained that he knew Saskatchewan (north) river and\r\nvalley from the mouth of the Saskatchewan on Lake Winnipeg up to its\r\nsource in Rocky mountains. He also knew Athabaska river and valley from\r\nits source down to its mouth in Athabaska lake, and was well acquainted\r\nwith all the country between those two rivers, from Rocky mountains down\r\nto Carlton, and from there, taking a line via Green lake, Beaver river,\r\nIle à la Crosse lake, Deep river, Buffalo lake, Methye river and lake,\r\nMethye portage and down the Clearwater to its junction with Athabaska\r\nriver, as an eastern line and Rocky mountains as a westward. He knew\r\nwell all the country between Athabaska and Peace rivers, from their\r\nmouths to their sources.\r\n\r\nAs to wood buffalo, at the time Mr. Moberly wrote, there was a band,\r\nprobably about two hundred, between the Saskatchewan and the Athabaska.\r\n(There are none there now). They kept on the mountains between Lac la\r\nBiche and McMurray. Another band, probably three hundred strong, was\r\nbetween Athabaska and Peace rivers on Thickwood and Birch mountains. A\r\nthird band, probably seven hundred strong, was scattered through the\r\nmountains between Liard and Peace rivers, and from Salt river to the\r\nfoot of Rocky mountains.\r\n\r\n                 MOOSE RUN ALL OVER THE WOODED COUNTRY\r\n\r\nnorth of the prairies and east of Rocky mountains.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of other game and fur animals in far northwestern\r\nCanada was given by Mr. Moberly as follows:—Reindeer (cariboo),\r\nlarge—all over the wood countries from Saskatchewan, to the barren\r\ngrounds of the north; reindeer, small—all over the barren grounds in\r\nthe north, and come south in winter as far as Lac de Brochet, Athabaska\r\nlake and Peace river, close to Rocky mountains; red deer—Athabaska and\r\nPeace river valleys; black tail deer, jumping deer and chevreux—same\r\ncountry as the red deer; black and brown bears—all over the wooded\r\ncountry and Rocky mountains; grizzly bears—Rocky mountains, valleys of\r\nthe Peace, Athabaska, Liard, and Fraser, but seldom farther than two\r\nhundred and fifty miles from the foot of the Rockies; beaver—Athabaska,\r\nPeace river and in fact all over the wooded country.\r\n\r\nIn his report of his exploration of the country between Churchill river\r\nand Lake Athabaska in 1892, Mr. J. B. Tyrrell writes:—“The moose\r\n(_Alces Americanus_), roams through the more thickly wooded parts of the\r\ncountry as far north as Stone river, which is probably near the northern\r\nlimit of its range. Seven individuals in all were seen during the course\r\nof the summer. The woodland caribou (_Rangifer caribou_) is said to\r\noccur in the more southern portion of the district, near Churchill\r\nriver, but none were seen. The barren ground caribou (_Rangifer\r\nGrœnlandicus_) comes south in winter to the south end of Reindeer lake\r\nand the upper portion of Mudjatik and Foster rivers. It travels north in\r\nspring to the Barren Lands, but a very few animals are occasionally left\r\nbehind, one having been shot in July near the north end of Cree lake.\r\nThe Canada lynx (_Lynx Canadensis_) is moderately abundant in some\r\nseasons in the more southern part of the district. The gray wolf (_Canis\r\nlupus occidentalis_) roams over the country, but is not plentiful. The\r\ncoyote (_Canis lisatrans_) is found occasionally as far north as the\r\nheight of land, one having been shot by the writer on one of the small\r\nlakes near the source of Foster river. It is, however, certainly not\r\ncommon in the district. Red, black and cross foxes (_Vulpes vulgaris_),\r\nwolverine (_Guloluscus_), marten (_Mustela Americana_), weasel\r\n(_Putorius vulgaris_), mink (_P. vison_) and skunk (_Mephitis\r\nmephitica_) are all found in greater or less abundance in the rolling\r\nwooded country underlain by Archaean rocks. The otter (_Lutra\r\nCanadensis_) was found on all the streams north to Stone river. The\r\nblack bear (_Ursus Americanus_) roams over the whole country. A few\r\nbeavers (_Castor fiber_) may still be met with in many of the streams. A\r\nconsiderable colony was found in the untravelled country near the source\r\nof Geikie river, but our canoemen brought back word of this (to the\r\nIndians) important discovery, and doubtless the beaver were killed\r\nduring the following winter. The muskrat (_Fiber zibethicus_) was seen\r\nswimming in all the streams. The rabbit or American hare (_Lepus\r\nAmericanus_) is found everywhere in the denser woods, but it did not\r\nseem to be anywhere abundant.\r\n\r\n                           FISH IN ABUNDANCE.\r\n\r\n“Fish seem to be everywhere abundant in the lakes and streams, but the\r\nnumber of species is very limited. The lake trout, (_Cristivomer\r\nnamaycush_) is, however, the largest of any of the finny tribes. One was\r\ncaught near the mouth of Stone river weighing twenty-five pounds. The\r\nwhitefish (_Coregonus clupeiformis_) is found everywhere throughout the\r\ndistrict, but more especially in the shallower lakes. The blue fish or\r\nBack’s grayling, (_Thymallus signifer_) was caught in Stone river at the\r\nfoot of the heavy falls below Black lake. Pike, (_Esox lucius_),\r\npickerel, (_Stozostethium vitreum_), methy, (_Lota lacustris_) and two\r\nor three species of suckers, (_Catastomus teres_ and _Myxostoma\r\nmacrolepidota_) were found in almost all the water stretches.\r\n\r\nMayor Cook, of Prince Albert, when examined before the Senate committee\r\nof 1907, explained that at that time he held the appointment of\r\ninspector of fisheries. He testified that once, some years previously,\r\non Beaver river, he had seen thirty-two thousand whitefish caught in two\r\nnights, which would average about two or two and one-half pounds each.\r\nThey put up the winter supply of fish in three or four nights. These\r\nfish were caught by half-breeds and Indians. The fish were coming down\r\nafter spawning, and those catching them set the nets right across the\r\nriver. This happened in close season, “but they did not bother about\r\nthat; it was the fish they were after.” There are whitefish, trout,\r\njackfish and some sturgeon in Torch and Saskatchewan rivers. Reindeer\r\nlake and the small lakes all around it are full of fish. They fish up\r\nthere until December 1. Sometimes the lakes are open until December 15,\r\nand break up again about May 15 to 20. It depends upon the size of the\r\nlake. If it is a very large lake it will take a little longer. Witness\r\nhad seen the lakes open on December 15. Those lakes are teeming with\r\nfish,—whitefish, sturgeon and trout. The trout run as high as fifty\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nThe sturgeon run from ten to one hundred pounds. Witness had never seen\r\none over one hundred pounds. He had seen one whitefish that weighed\r\nseventeen and one-half pounds, and trout that weighed fifty. He had them\r\nfor the exhibition in Ottawa, but the train was blocked and did not get\r\nthrough. The biggest jackfish he had ever seen weighed forty-five\r\npounds. They have some little bits of things but they range up to that.\r\nIn other places they have big fish from ten to forty-five pounds in\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Crean, Methye lake is a fine body of fresh water and is\r\nwell stocked with fish. “Wild fowl of every kind abound here. Moose and\r\ncaribou are plentiful. The result of Nature’s bounteousness, is that the\r\nnative, content with Nature’s provision, grows nothing. He kills the\r\nmoose for its hide.”\r\n\r\nIn his report on the area explored by him, in 1908, Mr. Crean\r\nstated:—“The staple food of the native north of the Saskatchewan is\r\nfish, and with this commodity he is amply supplied. Whitefish are found\r\nin all the lakes and rivers. Green lake is stocked to repletion with as\r\nfine whitefish as will be found anywhere. Ile à la Crosse lake is also\r\namply supplied. Canoe lake, Marten lake and all the immense water area\r\ncomprised of the numerous lakes in this district are well stocked with\r\nthis valuable food.\r\n\r\n“Game of all kinds abound, the principal species being the moose, the\r\ncaribou, the deer, the black bear, the cinnamon bear, the lynx, the wolf\r\n(timber), the fox, the wolverine, the otter, the beaver, the mink, the\r\nmarten, the muskrat, the rabbit, and the squirrel. Among the principal\r\nbirds found are swans, geese, ducks, partridges, ptarmigans, gulls,\r\njays, (whiskey jacks), kingfishers, crows, robins and loons.\r\n\r\n                       MOOSE ARE STILL PLENTIFUL\r\n\r\nbut are being killed in large numbers by the natives and the wolves. The\r\nsame remark would apply to caribou of the woodland variety. The barren\r\nland caribou or reindeer come down as far as Cree lake (one hundred\r\nmiles north of the Churchill) in numbers, and a few stray farther south.\r\nI shot one in the muskeg just north of Lac Ile à la Crosse.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Landscape in Clearwater valley.]\r\n\r\nMr. Crean states that an Indian living on Snake lake at the mouth of\r\nSandy river killed eighteen moose during the autumn of 1908.\r\n\r\n“Game, particularly moose,” according to Mr. Crean, “is plentiful in the\r\nMeadow lake district, and easily obtained. Beaver are plentiful in one\r\nor two districts, particularly along Clearwater valley and the rivers\r\ntributary to the Clearwater from the north. They are, of course, very\r\neasily killed, and consequently form a large portion of the fur in the\r\nnorth. When other fur is scarce, the Indian devotes his attention in\r\nparticular to the killing of beaver. Muskrat were extremely numerous and\r\nwere taken in very large numbers. Early in the fall, however, before the\r\nfur could possibly be of any use they were being killed in great\r\nnumbers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ATHABASKA COUNTRY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NORTHERN ALBERTA.\r\n\r\n         Agriculture and Arable Land in the Eastern Section or\r\n                          “Athabaska Country.”\r\n\r\n   A Section of the West Where Officials of the Hudson’s Bay Company\r\n     Were Directed to Cultivate Gardens.—Some Points Where Wheat has\r\n     been grown, Including the Sample which took First Prize at the\r\n     Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition.—Crude Indian Gardens at\r\n     Cowpar lake.—Livestock Grazing out in December and January.\r\n\r\nA glance at the latest “Railway Map of the Dominion of Canada,”\r\npublished by the Department of the Interior, will show that the\r\nsurveyed, and consequently fully-explored, part of the province of\r\nAlberta extends considerably farther north than do the lines which mark\r\nthe northernmost limit of the surveyed territory in Saskatchewan.\r\n\r\nThe areas of arable land in Northern Alberta are admittedly so extensive\r\nand important, and there has been such a large accumulation of evidence\r\nas to the latent agricultural wealth of the actual agricultural\r\nexperiments in this most promising region, that, with the object of\r\nenabling the reader the more readily to follow the text, and to assist\r\nhim in locating the geographical points mentioned, it has been deemed\r\nadvisable to divide the material referring to arable lands and\r\nagriculture in this territory into two separate chapters, corresponding\r\nwith two divisions of the area immediately under review. The country\r\nreadily lends itself to such a division; in fact, invites it.\r\n\r\nThe region west of the 114th meridian has long been known and designated\r\nas “Peace river country,” and possesses characteristics, and to some\r\nextent, a history quite its own. The remaining or eastern half of the\r\nterritory, at least as far north as the lower reach of Peace river, is\r\nthe main basin of the Athabaska and, as such, will be treated as a\r\ndistinct area in the present chapter, the one immediately following to\r\nbe devoted to the subject of the arable lands and agricultural\r\npossibilities of Peace river country.\r\n\r\nAthabaska river, which is the most southerly of the three great\r\ntributaries of the Mackenzie, rises in Rocky mountains near Mount Brown,\r\nat an altitude of about five thousand seven hundred feet, and pursues a\r\nnortheasterly and northerly course for nearly six hundred miles to\r\nAthabaska lake, falling in this distance some five thousand feet, and\r\nbeing interrupted by several series of rapids. In the first three\r\nhundred miles of its course it falls about four thousand feet, and\r\nreceives in succession Baptiste river from the west, the Macleod and\r\nPembina from the south, and the Lesser Slave, draining the large lake of\r\nthat name, from the west. Below its confluence with the last named\r\nstream, the Athabaska turns southeastward for some fifty miles and then\r\nresumes its northerly course. In the course of the next one hundred and\r\nfifty miles it receives, in succession, La Biche river from the east;\r\nQuito or Calling river from the west; Big Mouth brook from the east;\r\nPelican river from the west; and House river from the east. Just below\r\nthe mouth of the last river the Athabaska strikes a range of low hills,\r\nand in forcing a passage through them is deflected eastward, and for a\r\ndistance of about seventy-five miles contains many rapids, falling in\r\nthis distance some four hundred feet. At the lower end of this stretch\r\nit receives the waters of Clearwater river, its principal tributary\r\nbelow Lesser Slave river. The Clearwater rises on the height of land\r\nbetween the Churchill and the Athabaska, and pursuing a nearly straight\r\neasterly course for some one hundred and fifty miles, mingles its limpid\r\nwaters with the sediment-laden flood of the latter stream. In the lower\r\npart of its course the Clearwater occupies a deep valley and is very\r\nrapid. Thirty or forty miles above its mouth it is joined by the\r\nPembina, a stream of about equal volume. Below the mouth of the\r\nClearwater the Athabaska pursues a nearly direct course northward,\r\nreceiving Red, Moose, and Bar rivers from the west, and enters Athabaska\r\nlake through a number of channels including alluvial islands.\r\n\r\nLake Athabaska was known to the pioneer fur-traders and explorers as\r\n“Lake of the Hills,” and it is so described by Mackenzie and others.\r\n\r\nThe country drained by the Athabaska is\r\n\r\n                         MAINLY A ROLLING PLAIN\r\n\r\nand with the exception of a few areas of semi-prairie land, is well\r\nwooded, with a forest composed mainly of spruce, fir, pine, tamarack,\r\npoplar, birch and willow. A large part of its surface is occupied by\r\nmossy swamps, called muskegs, and hundreds of ponds and lakes, of which\r\nLesser Slave, seventy miles in length, is by far the largest, occupy its\r\nshallow valleys. Immense areas have been swept by fire, sometimes\r\nrepeatedly, and in some places the original forest covering has been\r\ndestroyed and small prairies have succeeded.\r\n\r\nThe first information we obtained as to the agricultural possibilities\r\nof Athabaska basin came from explorers and travellers passing through\r\nthe most northern portion of it on their way to Peace river, Great Slave\r\nlake and the Mackenzie via the old canoe route by Methye portage and the\r\nClearwater. In more recent years, particularly since the inauguration of\r\nsteamboat communication along the long navigable stretches of the\r\nAthabaska and Mackenzie, the favourite route to the far northwest has\r\nbeen down the Athabaska from Athabaska, and, as is only natural, our\r\nknowledge of the resources of the country has increased greatly.\r\n\r\nSir Alexander Mackenzie, as far back as 1787, saw at a trading station\r\nof Peter Pond, on Elk or Athabaska river, “as fine a kitchen garden as\r\nhe ever saw in Canada.”\r\n\r\nIt might be explained here, that in the spring of 1778, a number of the\r\nSaskatchewan traders put their goods into a common stock, and placed Mr.\r\nPeter Pond in charge of them, directing him to proceed to the Athabaska\r\nand trade with the Indians. He took the present Hudson’s Bay Company’s\r\nroute, by Cumberland House, Frog portage, Ile à la Crosse, and on to\r\nMethye portage and down Clearwater river to the forks of the Athabaska.\r\nHere he built a house, and in the spring of 1779 planted garden seeds.\r\n\r\nAs a general thing, at the early trading posts, agriculture of any kind,\r\neven the making of gardens, was neglected, and, rightly or wrongly, the\r\nofficials of the Hudson’s Bay Company got the credit of discouraging\r\nsuch ventures. If this had ever actually been the settled policy of the\r\ncompany, it was officially abandoned some time previous to the year\r\n1826, for, writing in the year mentioned at Chipewyan (north latitude\r\n58° 40′) of improvements in the country, the\r\n\r\n                    RESULT OF JUDICIOUS ARRANGEMENTS\r\n\r\nthen recently effected by the directors of the Hudson’s Bay Company, Sir\r\nJohn Franklin writes:—“They (the directors) have also directed, where\r\nthe soil will allow, a portion of the ground to be cultivated for the\r\ngrowth of culinary vegetables at each of their establishments, and I\r\nwitnessed the good effect of this order, even at this advanced post,\r\nwhere the ground is rocky; the tables of the officers being supplied\r\ndaily, and those of the men frequently, with potatoes and barley. Such\r\nluxuries were very rarely found beyond Cumberland House on the route\r\nthat we travelled during my former journey.”\r\n\r\nSir John Franklin also mentioned a phenomenon which has a considerable\r\nbearing upon the agricultural possibilities of this country, namely the\r\nquick change from winter to summer and the rapid growth of vegetation.\r\nHe wrote of the advent of spring at Chipewyan in 1827:—\r\n\r\n“There can scarcely be a higher gratification than that which is enjoyed\r\nin this country in witnessing the rapid change which takes place in the\r\ncourse of a few days in the spring. Scarcely does the snow disappear\r\nfrom the ground before the trees are clothed with thick foliage, the\r\nshrubs open their leaves, and put forth their variegated flowers, and\r\nthe\r\n\r\n                   WHOLE PROSPECT BECOMES ANIMATING.”\r\n\r\nSir John also mentioned that the first flight of swans northward was\r\nnoticed at Chipewyan on April 15, the first geese on April 20, the first\r\nrobins on May 7, and the first house martins on May 12. Barley was sown\r\nat Chipewyan on May 15, potatoes on May 21 and garden seeds on May 22,\r\nand it was expected that all would be ready for use by the close of the\r\nfollowing September.\r\n\r\nSir George Simpson’s party were regaled with “new, but very small\r\npotatoes,” on August 11, 1828.\r\n\r\nSir J. Richardson, before the British parliamentary select committee of\r\n1857, asked to state to the committee any general opinion which he had\r\nformed of the capabilities of any considerable portion of the country\r\nwhich he had traversed, for the purpose of settlement and colonization,\r\nreplied:—“With regard to the production of cereals, wheat may be grown\r\nup to the 58th parallel of latitude (same latitude as Fort Vermilion) in\r\nfavourable places, but only in parts.”\r\n\r\nThe report of the Dominion Government’s survey parties sent out in\r\nadvance of the Canadian Pacific contain important references to\r\nagriculture in the country. In the report for 1877-78 (p. 332) appears\r\nthe following reference to Chipewyan (latitude 58·7°):—“Professor\r\nMacoun there obtained in 1876, fine samples of wheat and barley—the\r\nformer sixty-eight pounds to the bushel and the latter fifty-eight\r\npounds. At the French mission, two miles above the fort, oats, wheat and\r\nbarley were all cut by August 26.” In 1880 report it is stated (p. 102),\r\n“Reverend Gordon said in 1880 that wheat and barley raised at Chipewyan\r\nreceived a medal at the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition of 1876.”\r\n\r\nIn the report of 1877-78 (p. 326) there is this reference to McMurray\r\n(latitude 56·7°):—“Professor Macoun on September 8, 1875, found\r\ntomatoes, cucumbers, wheat and barley, under cultivation together with\r\nall vegetables found in kitchen gardens in Ontario. He spent ten days\r\nthere and obtained specimens of wheat and barley which\r\n\r\n                        HAVE ASTONISHED EVERYONE\r\n\r\nto whom they were exhibited; many of the ears contained one hundred\r\ngrains and the weight of both wheat and barley was nearly ten pounds\r\nabove the ordinary weight per bushel. These grains had been raised on\r\nsoil comparatively poor—very poor for the district—and lying only a\r\nfew feet above the level of Lake Athabaska.”\r\n\r\nIn a report of his then recent trip through this country written by\r\nWilliam Oglivie, D.L.S., in 1884, he writes:—“A great deal of the soil\r\nalong the bank of the Athabaska was of very fair quality. At McMurray,\r\nwhere there are a couple of small prairies or meadows, the soil is good,\r\nand the root crops and garden produce raised there are generally very\r\ngood. The Hudson’s Bay Company have a garden at McMurray of upwards of\r\nan acre in extent, and the Episcopal mission one of smaller area, but\r\nthe soil is very sandy. The Roman Catholic mission have a garden also,\r\nmost of which they obtained by draining a bog into the lake. In the\r\nseason of 1883 (which was a pretty favourable one in that district,\r\nbeing free from summer frosts) the Hudson’s Bay Company raised about\r\nfour hundred bushels of potatoes, the Episcopal mission thirty bushels\r\non a small patch, and the Roman Catholic mission about five hundred\r\nbushels. Many of the retired Hudson’s Bay Company’s servants also have\r\nsmall patches which they cultivate, potatoes and fish being the\r\nprincipal articles of food used during the winter.”\r\n\r\nDoctor Robert Bell, before the Senate committee of 1887, testified that\r\nthey grew cucumbers and melons as far north as Lac la Biche. He had seen\r\nthem there himself, and he was not sure but that they grew pumpkins,\r\ntoo. He pointed out that where cucumbers and melons grow pumpkins will\r\ngrow also. It is hard, Doctor Bell pointed out in the course of his\r\nevidence upon this occasion, to induce the Indians to grow anything.\r\nEven potatoes, which they all know to be a safe crop, they will not grow\r\nunless encouraged by supplying them. If supplied with seed in the autumn\r\nthey will not preserve any over the winter. They would not take the\r\ntrouble to dig a pit or build a cellar in which to preserve the seed,\r\nbut in the spring, when the time comes for planting, if anyone were to\r\ngive them the seed they would plant it. Artichokes would be very\r\nsuitable to introduce amongst the Indians, because they are very hardy\r\nand productive; the seed remains in the ground and the Indians could not\r\ndestroy it all.\r\n\r\nMr. Alfred von Hamerstein, who has lived in Athabaska district since\r\n1897, trading and prospecting, was examined before the select committee\r\nof the Senate of Canada in 1907.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S. S. Grahame at McMurray.]\r\n\r\nThe agricultural resources of the Athabaska district, as far as this\r\nwitness could understand, were indicated by the farming that was then\r\nactually being conducted\r\n\r\n                        WITH FAIRLY GOOD SUCCESS\r\n\r\nat Athabaska. At Baptiste lake there was, when the witness first went\r\nthere, no agriculture attempted. He was the first man to introduce\r\nfarming there. He kept a trading store, and the natives insisted on\r\nhaving different kinds of seeds. Amongst others he got some flower\r\nseeds, and some lovely flowers were raised. The people raise some crops\r\nthere now. It is a very good ranching country—first-class. Several\r\npeople went up there with cattle. A man named Mailloux took one hundred\r\nand twenty head of cattle, and they were in good shape. The kind of\r\ngrass there is a red top, a very big grass. The country has all been\r\nburnt over and the timber has fallen, so the grass cannot be cut with a\r\nmowing machine, but in some places they have cleared away the fallen\r\ntimber and can use machinery now. Vetches and wild pea vines grow all\r\nover that country, but there is no bunch grass to be found; it is mostly\r\nred top. How far north it grows witness could not say. He had traced it\r\nup in very large quantities on Slave river. About a hundred or two\r\nhundred yards from the river there is a big slough, and this grass grows\r\nall along there very luxuriantly. There is no place along the northern\r\nshores of Lake Athabaska where grass can be grown. It is mostly rock and\r\nmuskeg.\r\n\r\nAt McMurray, according to Mr. von Hamerstein, the land is good, and\r\nbetween the junction of the Clearwater and the Athabaska there is a flat\r\nof land about three miles long, and from a quarter of a mile to a mile\r\nand a half or two miles wide, which is very fine soil; but the rest of\r\nit is all hills covered by an inch and a half of moss, under the moss\r\nbeing the limestone rock. They raise good garden stuff at McMurray. A\r\nparty there had good crops for three years.\r\n\r\nWhere there is soil to be found it is very good, mostly old river beds\r\nor where eddies have accumulated soil; but the rest is sand and muskeg.\r\nEast of McMurray there are several lakes, the centre of what is\r\ndescribed as fine hay country. The natives there have from sixty to\r\neighty horses, and there are reported to be\r\n\r\n                          GOOD GRAZING PATCHES\r\n\r\nround the lakes. It is probably a better ranching country than an\r\nagricultural one. To the northwest of this district are some muskeg\r\nlakes, where the natives have quite a few horses and cut considerable\r\nhay.\r\n\r\nFrom Fort Smith, going in a southerly direction to a place called Salt\r\nriver they have a very fine large prairie, and it extends right through\r\nto Peace point. The people there are not given to farming. It is against\r\ntheir interests, because they could make a living much more easily by\r\nhunting. People often ask why they do not farm, but it must be\r\nremembered that in order to raise a crop of potatoes they would have to\r\nstay by it the whole season; and there is more variety in hunting. But\r\nsome of them do farm and raise a few cattle. The country is difficult of\r\naccess; they do not get any new stock, and it has become badly inbred.\r\nAs a result he had seen cattle there having the head of a bull and the\r\nbody of a calf. There are not very many cattle in there; only certain\r\nnatives have them, and a man with four or five head of cattle is a very\r\nrich man. Some patches of land are very good.\r\n\r\nMr. Elihu Stewart, who had travelled over the northwest while\r\nSuperintendent of Forestry, stated before the Senate committee of 1907\r\nthat along the Athabaska the country is composed of a succession of\r\nrolling hills, and there is a good deal of light soil. The valleys are\r\nvery good, and Mr. Stewart understood that the country through by Lake\r\nWaubascow, all the way to Lesser Slave lake, is through a good district\r\nof country. Through this district there is good land—perhaps not all\r\nthe way through. Along the Athabaska the country is light, second-class\r\nland, but Mr. Stewart found at Calling river, some sixty miles below\r\nAthabaska, a man\r\n\r\n                          RAISING WHEAT THERE.\r\n\r\nHe says he raises as good wheat as can be grown, but Mr. Stewart would\r\nnot consider from the appearance along the banks that there were the\r\nsame alluvial deposits that are found farther north.\r\n\r\nMr. H. A. Conroy of the Indian Department informed the Senate committee\r\nin 1907 that the Indians and half-breeds told him that the country\r\nbetween Great Slave river and Hay river is covered with buffalo grass,\r\nexcepting a little timber that grows in a fringe around Great Slave\r\nlake. He had information from Indians living in that country that it is\r\nan open country covered with prairie grass.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Burr Tyrrell, in his evidence before the Senate committee of\r\n1907, remarked as to the country immediately north of Lake Athabaska\r\nthat it could not be considered as being within the arable area. The\r\narable belt, however, as one goes west from Hudson bay to Athabaska\r\nriver, widens enormously. He spoke generally of the vast country west of\r\nAthabaska river to Peace river country, and said there is certainly a\r\nlarge tract of agricultural land there. However, one or another may\r\ndiffer about the value of any particular part of that country. In the\r\ncountry, going west into Peace river region, there is certainly a large\r\narea of good land that Mr. Tyrrell would not attempt to confine inside\r\nof such a belt as he had been speaking of.\r\n\r\nW. F. Bredin, M.L.A., in his evidence before the Senate committee of\r\n1907, said that descending Athabaska river from McMurray, where\r\nClearwater river goes into the Athabaska, the elevation of the plateau\r\nabove the river is very much less than it is on the upper river. It\r\nlooks like a great alluvial plain, from the river all along from\r\nMcMurray to Lake Athabaska, two hundred miles. That country is more or\r\nless timbered, and the soil is excellent. Going down Slave river to\r\nGreat Slave lake, for a distance of three hundred miles, on the east of\r\nSlave river, it is all rocks; while west of the river the country is all\r\nalluvial, and the soil is generally very good, right down to Great Slave\r\nlake.\r\n\r\nAt Chipewyan on Athabaska lake the Roman Catholic priests have a farm\r\nwhich was originally a muskeg, right amongst the Laurentian rocks, and\r\nthey grow wheat there that was awarded a\r\n\r\n                  MEDAL AT THE CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION.\r\n\r\nThe muskeg between the Athabaska and the Peace can all be drained and\r\ncultivated. These muskegs are from a foot to three feet deep until you\r\nstrike hardpan. The moss keeps the heat of the sun out. In fact there is\r\nice in some of those muskegs all the year round, covered with moss.\r\n\r\nMr. Frank Crean, in his 1909 report, gives the following information\r\nregarding the country west of Methye and Buffalo lakes and south of\r\nClearwater river:—“Along Pembina river there are fine hay meadows which\r\nshould enable anybody who desired to keep cattle to procure ample feed\r\nfor the winter. To the west of Cowpar lake there is a large prairie\r\nwhich would certainly afford magnificent summer range, though I am\r\ninformed that in winter the snow is too deep for cattle to range out.”\r\nNorthwest of Cowpar lake Mr. Crean saw some horses grazing in December.\r\nTheir owner had made no arrangement to winter them, and Mr. Crean was\r\ntold that the horses thrived.\r\n\r\nCowpar lake lies just south of latitude 56°. It is a small lake, and of\r\nitself of no great importance. The surrounding country, however, is\r\nexceptionally good farming land, and to the east and south at about ten\r\nmiles distance is found the commencement of a large prairie about forty\r\nmiles long and varying from twelve to fifteen miles in width. This\r\nprairie is in its present state fitted for agriculture. The Indians from\r\nCowpar lake go there in the spring and plant gardens, leaving them until\r\nthe fall when they bring the produce to their homes at Cowpar lake.\r\n\r\nMr. Crean continues:—“Pembina river flows through the south end of this\r\nprairie, and several small lakes touch it. The prairie is watered by\r\nsmall creeks draining into these lakes, and altogether it is\r\n\r\n                     AN IDEAL SPOT FOR THE PIONEER,\r\n\r\nas hay, water, wood and fish are to be found in abundance throughout its\r\nextent. The land adjoining Cowpar lake on the east and south is all\r\narable, being open and rolling. To the northeast, towards Whitefish\r\nlake, the land is also good. It is easy to predict that Cowpar lake will\r\nsome day be a centre of a considerable settlement, although at present\r\nthe only occupants are about four families of Chipewyans.”\r\n\r\nWinefred lake, according to Mr. Crean, is a large body of water amply\r\nstocked with fine whitefish, and Indians both from the south and north\r\ncome to Winefred lake to catch fish in the fall. The country surrounding\r\nthe lake is mostly swampy hay land, but might, he thought, be easily\r\ndrained. A good deal of muskeg is found in this vicinity, indeed, more\r\nthan anywhere else that Mr. Crean travelled on the watershed of the\r\nAthabaska.\r\n\r\nAbout Heart lake the land is all good though somewhat rolling and\r\ninclined to be broken. There is no more obstacle to farming around this\r\nlake than there is anywhere else between it and Edmonton. The country is\r\nidentical with that passed through en route to Edmonton. In fact the\r\ncountry is almost prairie, some bluffs of poplar being the only pretence\r\nof woods.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the northern portion of the area explored by him in\r\n1909, Mr. Crean states:—“In the matter of attempts at agriculture the\r\nfact that there is no demand for agricultural produce in the north\r\nprevents people who live there from carrying on even experimental work.\r\nWheat has been grown successfully at McMurray, which was about the most\r\nnortherly point touched by me. Here, too, all the ordinary vegetables\r\ngrown in the more southerly portions of the province are grown with the\r\ngreatest success.” Mixed farming would appear to be an industry which\r\nmost readily adapts itself to northern conditions. Wheat can be grown in\r\nalmost any part of the north which I have explored. It is undeniable\r\nthat northern latitudes increase the likelihood of summer frosts. If,\r\nhowever, live stock is kept, the larger yield of grain to the acre, even\r\nif slightly frosted, will pay quite as well converted into beef or pork\r\nas a smaller yield of the better quality grain in more southern\r\nlatitudes.”\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police have contributed\r\nconsiderable valuable information regarding the northern section of the\r\ncountry under review in this chapter.\r\n\r\nIn his 1909 report, Inspector D. M. Howard, of the Royal Northwest\r\nMounted Police, referring to the northern section, wrote:—“In the\r\nnorthern part of the district, Chipewyan and Smith Landing, very little\r\ngrain is grown. The Roman Catholic mission at Fort Smith have put in a\r\nsmall crop of about fifteen acres under oats and barley this year as an\r\nexperiment. There are about thirty-five head of cattle all told in\r\nChipewyan sub-district, but the stock is not very good, being too much\r\ninbred. The Hudson’s Bay Company brought in ten head of horses this year\r\nfrom Edmonton and the Roman Catholic mission brought four from\r\nVermilion; this, with the three police horses, makes a total of about\r\nforty head.”\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1909 Sergt. R. W. Macleod, of the Royal Northwest\r\nMounted Police, made a patrol across country from Fort Vermilion to the\r\nmouth of Hay river on Great Slave lake. In his report (p. 178, Annual\r\nReport of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police for 1909), he states that\r\nfrom Fort Vermilion for about sixty miles the country is prairie with\r\nsmall poplar bluffs scattered over it, and the next twenty-five miles is\r\nmostly pine bush with here and there a small prairie, then on into Hay\r\nriver at Horse track is prairie with poplar bluffs and willow scrub, a\r\ntotal distance of one hundred and ten miles from Fort Vermilion. In 1905\r\nthe government had a road cut out, corduroyed, and graded the entire\r\ndistance suitable for a wagon road. Previous to that time an Indian pack\r\ntrail was the only way to travel. The Hudson’s Bay Company and Revillon\r\nBrothers each built a sales shop and residence at the end of the wagon\r\nroad on the south bank of Hay river, and have been doing business there\r\nin the winter only, for fur. There are no white people in the country\r\ncloser than Fort Vermilion. The country between Hay river and Fort\r\nVermilion is nearly\r\n\r\n                  ALL APPARENTLY SUITABLE FOR FARMING,\r\n\r\nwith a splendid supply of wood and water. Hay river is about one hundred\r\nyards wide at the Horse trace (local name) and is fed by numerous\r\nmuskegs to the north of Dunvegan on Peace river, and the southeast slope\r\nof the divide between Peace and Liard rivers.\r\n\r\nWhen Sergeant Macleod and his patrol were at Alexandra falls on January\r\n29, they found that three small bands of Indian horses were wintering\r\nout on the portage, which is a prairie with poplar bluffs.\r\n\r\nCorporal Mellor (of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police) in September of\r\nthe same year, made a patrol with horses into the buffalo country\r\nsouthwest of Smith Landing. In his report the Corporal states that from\r\nSalt river “we proceeded northwest through about eight miles of small\r\npoplar, and then across a large stretch of prairie country. This is not\r\nprairie country in the generally accepted term, but simply ground of a\r\nmarshy nature, perfectly flat, and covered with a luxuriant growth of\r\ngrass. This would doubtless afford splendid land were it not that the\r\nwater thereon is intensely salty and quite unfit for use. These prairies\r\nare of large extent stretching from Peace river, in the south, I am\r\ntold, to Buffalo river, in the north, a distance of over one hundred\r\nmiles. They are dotted all over with thick clumps of willows, the only\r\ntrees growing thereon.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Indian Camp near Fort Smith.]\r\n\r\nIn the last annual report of Superintendent G. E. Sanders, D.S.O.,\r\ncommanding “N” Division at Athabaska, and dated October 1, 1911, that\r\nofficer describes the area from Athabaska river to Great Slave lake and\r\nwest to the Rockies as an agricultural country. He states:—“The general\r\nstate of the district from an agricultural and business point of view is\r\none of great development and progress. The stream of settlement into the\r\ncountry round about Athabaska and to upper Peace river and Grande\r\nprairie has continued to a much larger extent during the year. With the\r\ninflux of settlement traders have followed and a general\r\n\r\n                      AIR OF PROSPERITY PREVAILS,\r\n\r\nwith very optimistic hopes for the future. The homestead entries at\r\nAthabaska for the first three months of this year exceeded the entire\r\nnumber for 1909, and for the past months the entries are upwards of one\r\nhundred and seventy-five in excess of those received during the whole of\r\n1910. The homestead entries at Lesser Slave lake and Grande prairie have\r\nincreased at an even greater rate. At the latter place, the first day\r\nthe Land Office opened there, seventy-five entries were received.”\r\n\r\n“It was generally expected that the railway would reach Athabaska in\r\nNovember, but the contractors have met with so many set-backs, due to\r\nthe weather, shortage of labour and, lately, sickness amongst their\r\nhorses, that it is extremely doubtful when the work will be completed.\r\n\r\n“As a consequence of the coming of the railway the town of Athabaska has\r\nexperienced quite a boom in real estate, and the prices for lots in the\r\ntownsite and for land adjoining have become very high, lots that sold\r\nfor three hundred dollars last year are now exchanging hands at three\r\nthousand dollars, and land within a mile has been sold for one hundred\r\nand seventy-five dollars per acre. A great deal of building is going on\r\nand every one predicts an important future for the place on account of\r\nits many natural advantages, and its situation making it the\r\ndistribution point for the vast country to the north.”\r\n\r\nIn an interview, Hon. F. Oliver, ex-Minister of the Interior, stated,\r\nafter his long trip in 1910 (See p. 27) that along the rivers passed\r\nthrough proceeding from Edmonton to the delta of the Mackenzie where the\r\nbanks are high the soil and climate conditions are perfectly good for\r\nagriculture. So far as McMurray, conditions are entirely good for\r\nagriculture, judging from what he saw himself and from what people told\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe minister explained this statement by pointing out that the\r\ndifference in latitude is neutralized by the great drop in altitude and\r\nthe\r\n\r\n                  INFLUENCE OF THE WARM CHINOOK WIND.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Indian Family arriving at McMurray for Treaty.]\r\n\r\nMcMurray, while two hundred miles farther north than Edmonton, is but\r\neight hundred and fifty feet above sea level, while Edmonton had an\r\naltitude of two thousand two hundred feet.\r\n\r\nMr. Oliver here made reference to conditions which are to-day recognized\r\nby men of science.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. E. A. Preble, of the U.S. Biological Survey (See p.\r\n22), “The climatic conditions of the various parts of Athabaska valley\r\nvary considerably, according to location. The more open portions of the\r\nupper part of the valley, though lying at a considerable altitude, enjoy\r\nthe ‘Chinook’ winds, which so temper the climate that it compares\r\nfavourably with more easterly regions lying much farther south. Lack of\r\ndetailed data precludes the possibility of comparing absolutely the\r\nclimatic conditions of the upper and the lower Athabaska; but the\r\neffects of the ‘Chinook’ winds are felt to some extent throughout the\r\ncourse of the river.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the same authority—“The climate of Athabaska lake is not\r\nradically different from that of other parts of the Mackenzie region\r\nwhich are practically removed from the influence of the warm Pacific\r\nwinds. Though it lies at a low altitude, the proximity of the lake to\r\nthe “Barren Ground,” from which winds are frequent, keeps its average\r\ntemperature rather low. An occasional warm west wind slightly tempers\r\nthe winter climate. The Peace and the Athabaska break up at their mouths\r\nabout May 1, but the neighbouring part of the lake usually does not open\r\nuntil about the middle of May, and the eastern part probably not before\r\nJune. The lake usually closes at Chipewyan some time in November.”\r\n\r\nMr. H. A. Conroy informed the Senate committee of 1907 that he had\r\ntravelled through Athabaska-Peace river country once when for twenty-one\r\ndays in January he did not need his coat in the middle of the day. The\r\ncattle were all out in the pasture fields. He had been going in there\r\nevery year for eight years, and had been there for five winters. Mr.\r\nConroy stated that he never saw a very deep snowfall in that country. He\r\nfelt pretty sure that the ‘Chinook’ winds go through to Athabaska lake.\r\nHe remarked that in that country in the winter he did not suffer as much\r\nfrom cold as he had suffered in Ottawa, and he slept out every night,\r\nsometimes under a tent and sometimes in the open. He travelled once with\r\na dog train and afterwards with ponies, and got along very well with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PEACE RIVER COUNTRY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NORTHERN ALBERTA.\r\n\r\n   Agriculture and Arable Land in the Western Section or “Peace River\r\n                                Region.”\r\n\r\n   Where Wheat Has Been Grown with Remarkable Success for Many Years.\r\n     —Scientific Explorers Early Recognized this as a Wheat Growing\r\n     Country.—A Head of Cabbage Fifty-three and a half inches in\r\n     Circumference.—Livestock Lives Out of Doors in Winter.—\r\n     According to a Church of England Missionary, Peace river Enjoys\r\n     the Finest Climate in the World.\r\n\r\nThe more westerly (or Peace river) section of northern Alberta is\r\nattracting much attention on account of its remarkable agricultural\r\npossibilities; and the numerous settlements which have, during the past\r\nfew years, been established, have practically demonstrated that the\r\nglowing accounts which have from time to time reached the outside world\r\nas to the fertility of Peace river country, have not been exaggerated.\r\n\r\nPeace river, which has lent its name to the country along its banks,\r\nwhether in British Columbia or in northern Alberta, is formed by the\r\njunction of Finlay and Parsnip rivers, two transmontane streams, and is\r\nthe largest and longest of the tributaries of the Mackenzie. It rises in\r\nand drains a large district west of Rocky mountains, and then continuing\r\neastwards, intersects the axis of that range and drains the country\r\nlying along its eastern slopes, through four degrees of latitude. Its\r\nlength, from the confluence of Finlay and Parnsip rivers, to the point\r\nat which it unites with the waters flowing from Lake Athabaska to form\r\nSlave river, is seven hundred and fifty-seven miles, but measuring from\r\nSummit lake, the source of its principal branch, it is approximately\r\nnine hundred and five miles.\r\n\r\nFrom the confluence of the Finlay and the Parsnip, the Peace flows in a\r\ngeneral easterly direction for some three hundred miles to its junction\r\nwith the Smoky, falling in this distance a little less than eight\r\nhundred feet. The country through which it flows may be considered as a\r\nplateau in which it has excavated\r\n\r\n                         A RATHER DEEP VALLEY.\r\n\r\nA number of streams, Pine river from the south being one of the largest,\r\ndischarge their waters into it. Back from the river the country is\r\nmainly level or rolling, and is thinly wooded. Smoky river is the\r\nlargest tributary of the Peace. Its principal branches rise on the\r\neastern slope of Rocky mountains, and it drains a large extent of thinly\r\nwooded and prairie country. Below the mouth of the Smoky, the Peace\r\nturns and pursues a winding though general northerly course nearly to\r\nFort Vermilion. It is bordered at first by steep sandstone cliffs, but\r\nits valley gradually becomes wider and shallower. Extensive plains\r\ncomparatively level and clothed with grass or a sparse growth of\r\npoplars, border it on both sides. North of Fort Vermilion this character\r\nof country is said to extend to the valleys on Hay and Buffalo rivers.\r\nThe country between Peace river and Great Slave lake, however, is very\r\nimperfectly known.\r\n\r\nOne of the first records we have of successful agriculture in Peace\r\nriver country is in the famous diary of Daniel Williams Harmon of the\r\nNorthwest Company’s service, who spent several years there. He speaks\r\nfavourably of the situation of Dunvegan (north latitude 56°, west\r\nlongtitude 119°), where he found himself located in October, 1808. He\r\ngoes on to say in his diary:—“Our principal food will be the flesh of\r\nthe buffalo, moose, red deer, and bear. We have a tolerably good kitchen\r\ngarden, and we are in no fear that we shall want the means of a\r\ncomfortable subsistence.”\r\n\r\nIn an entry in his diary dated May 6, the following spring, Harmon\r\nstates:—“We have planted our potatoes, and sowed most of our garden\r\nseeds.” Under date June 2, the same year, we find the entry:—“The seeds\r\nwhich we sowed in the garden, have sprung up, and grow remarkably well.\r\nThe present prospect is, that strawberries, red raspberries,\r\nshad-berries, cherries, etc., will be abundant this season.”\r\n\r\nJuly 21 Harmon writes:—“We have cut down our barley and I\r\n\r\n                         THINK IT IS THE FINEST\r\n\r\nthat I have ever seen in any country. The soil on the points of land\r\nalong this river is excellent.”\r\n\r\nUnder the date of September 1, the same year, Harmon noted the\r\ncommencement of the annual migration of wild fowl southward, and on\r\nFriday, October 6th, he wrote in his diary:—“As the weather begins to\r\nbe cold, we have taken our vegetables out of the ground, which we find\r\nto have been very productive.”\r\n\r\nIn his diary for the following year, Harmon records a summer frost on\r\nJune 23, writing:—“The last night was so cold, that the tops of our\r\npotatoes were frozen.” The frost in question does not seem to have\r\ndamaged the crops, for on Wednesday the 3rd of the following October\r\nthis observant diarist wrote:—“We have taken our potatoes out of the\r\nground, and find that nine bushels, which we planted May 10 last, have\r\nproduced a little more than one hundred and fifty bushels. The other\r\nvegetables in our garden have yielded an increase, much in the same\r\nproportion, which is sufficient proof that the soil of the points of\r\nland along the river is good. Indeed, I am of the opinion, that wheat,\r\nrye, barley, oats, peas, etc., would grow well in the plains around us.”\r\n\r\nIt is very evident that all of the officials of the fur trading\r\ncompanies who were on duty in Peace river country did not devote the\r\nsame intelligent attention to agriculture that Harmon and his colleagues\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nWhen Charles Horetzky, C.E., was at Dunvegan in 1873 (See p. 17) there\r\nwas no bread used, and the only vegetables served at meals were some\r\n“very diminutive potatoes.” Mr. Horetzky comments as follows on this\r\nsubject:—“Owing to the fact that the Company’s agents are liable to be\r\nsuddenly removed from one post to another, those people are, not\r\nunnaturally, averse to the expenditure of time and labour necessary for\r\nfarming experiments; hence the absence of farm produce at these posts.\r\nBut the natural advantages of excellent soil of unlimited extent, and\r\nthe proverbially early disappearance of the snow in spring, would lead\r\none to believe that good crops of barley, potatoes, and fall wheat might\r\nbe successfully raised in this part of the Northwest.”\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest arguments advanced by Mr. Horetzky in his advocacy\r\nof Peace river pass route for the Canadian Pacific Railway was that a\r\nline built via this route would open up\r\n\r\n                         A VAST FERTILE REGION\r\n\r\nsituated to the south of Peace river—“a region probably comprising an\r\narea equal in extent to Manitoba, well wooded with abundance of fresh\r\nwater, of excellent soil, and in all probability possessing unlimited\r\nquantities of good coal. The climate is most salubrious, and, by all\r\naccounts, as mild as, if not milder than, that of Red river. On the\r\nextensive plains bordering upon Peace river, both north and south of it,\r\nsnow rarely exceeds two feet in depth, and never packs.”\r\n\r\nThe travellers and traders who have been in Peace river country are as\r\nenthusiastic about its picturesque appearance as about its apparent\r\nfertility.\r\n\r\nMr. Horetzky reached Peace river a few miles above the mouth of the\r\nSmoky September 30, 1873, and thus describes the scene:—“We feasted our\r\neyes on the glorious landscape now mapped out before us. A strong\r\nwesterly gale was blowing, but the air was so warm and balmy, that to\r\nrecline on the beautiful grassy sward, full face to the blast, was\r\npositively delicious. For several miles, to the southwest, the noble\r\nriver, flowing eight hundred feet below us, on its silent course to\r\nArctic ocean, could be distinctly traced as it meandered through its\r\nmighty valley. Several large and wooded islands dotted its surface here\r\nand there, causing eddies and whirlpools, which in their turn made long\r\nand faint streaks of foam, barely visible in the distance. From our\r\nposition, and embracing an angle of fully one hundred and thirty\r\ndegrees, or, in other words, from the northwest round to south, a\r\nboundless and nearly level expanse of country could be taken in at a\r\nglance, the only breaks being the great valleys of Peace and Smoky\r\nrivers, than which nothing we had ever seen could be more beautiful, the\r\nformer especially, in its magnitude and depth, surpassing all we had\r\nanticipated.”\r\n\r\nThe pioneer missionaries attached to the Church of England and Roman\r\nCatholic missions appear to have done more towards demonstrating the\r\nagricultural possibilities of Peace river country, and the whole\r\nMackenzie basin, than the fur traders.\r\n\r\nIn the “Mission Field” of January 2, 1882 (a London monthly publication\r\nof the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel), the Right Reverend\r\nBompas, Bishop of the Church of England in Athabaska and Mackenzie\r\ndistricts (his diocese comprising the centre Arctic watershed of British\r\nAmerica), published the following:—“The excellence of the land in Peace\r\nriver country for farming purposes is well known; the\r\n\r\n                      SOIL IS RICH AND PRODUCTIVE,\r\n\r\nand the climate most salubrious. A mission station is established at\r\nFort Vermilion under the charge of the Reverend Arthur Garrioch, and a\r\nchurch is fast approaching completion. Other mission stations have been\r\nstarted at different parts of the river, and in 1878 a mission farm was\r\nbegun which the bishop hopes will in time obviate the necessity of\r\nprocuring all the supplies of flour, etc., from Red river, the expense\r\nof which, from heavy freights, is so great that every bag of flour by\r\nthe time it reaches the missionaries north of Athabaska costs upwards of\r\n£5.”\r\n\r\nIt was as superintendent of the mission farms that the head of the\r\nLawrence family, the originators of farming on an extensive scale and by\r\nscientific methods in Peace river country, was attracted there.\r\n\r\nBesides the satisfactory pioneer attempts at tilling the soil of Peace\r\nriver country, the raising of live stock was many years ago demonstrated\r\nto be successful. As early as 1823 there was an infant ranching industry\r\nthere, Sir George Simpson’s party having noted a small band of half a\r\ndozen horses when approaching Dunvegan.\r\n\r\nIn the reports of the government explorers a great deal of interesting\r\ninformation will be found as to the soil, climate, and agricultural\r\npossibilities of Peace river country.\r\n\r\nProfessor John Macoun was the first scientific explorer to draw\r\nattention to the agricultural possibilities of Peace river country,\r\nafter making a thorough examination of the natural flora, the soil,\r\nclimatic conditions, etc. Mr. Macoun had accompanied the first Canadian\r\nPacific Railway survey expedition, and had subsequently been botanist to\r\nthe geological survey party appointed to investigate this very country.\r\nThere was much information as to the agricultural possibilities of the\r\ncountry in Professor Macoun’s official reports, and he summarized his\r\nconclusions in his book “Manitoba and the Great Northwest,” published in\r\n1882. He defines a tract lying between the upper reaches of Athabaska\r\nriver and the fifty-seventh parallel of latitude, in Peace river basin,\r\nwhich he considers “may be classed as fertile,” and estimates its area\r\nas about thirty-one thousand five hundred and fifty square miles.\r\nSpeaking of this tract, he states:—“Its average elevation may be stated\r\nas little over two thousand feet, and this is maintained with\r\nconsiderable uniformity, for though the general surface slopes slightly\r\nfrom the north and south toward Peace river, the region as a whole may\r\nbe considered as a plateau through which the great gorge-like valley of\r\nthe Peace has been excavated.\r\n\r\n“The northern banks of Peace river valley are also very generally open\r\ngrassed, and parts of the valley of the Smoky and other rivers have a\r\nsimilar character. The total area of\r\n\r\n                   PRAIRIE LAND, WEST OF SMOKY RIVER,\r\n\r\nmay be about three thousand square miles. The remainder of the surface\r\nis generally occupied by second-growth forest, occasionally dense, but\r\nmore often open and composed of aspen, birch, and cottonwood, with a\r\ngreater or less proportion of coniferous trees. Some patches of the\r\noriginal forest, however, remain, particularly in the river valleys, and\r\nare composed of much larger trees, chiefly coniferous, among which the\r\nblack spruce is most abundant. Handsome groves of old and large\r\ncottonwoods are also to be found in some of the valleys. Where the soil\r\nbecomes locally sandy and poor, and more particularly in some of the\r\nmore elevated parts of the ridges before described, a thick growth of\r\nscrub pine and black spruce, in which the individual trees are small, is\r\nfound, and in swampy regions the taramack is not wanting, but grows\r\ngenerally intermixed with the black spruce.\r\n\r\n“Though the prairies are most immediately available from an agricultural\r\npoint of view, the regions now covered with second growth and forest,\r\nwhere the soil itself, if not inferior, will eventually be equally\r\nvaluable. The largest tract of poor land is that bordering the valley of\r\nthe Athabaska on the north.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Macoun was examined before the Senate committee of 1888 and\r\ngave a considerable amount of information, all valuable at the time, and\r\nmuch of it still so, as to the character of Peace river country from\r\nMacleod in latitude 55°, to Lake Athabaska, up the Athabaska to the\r\nClearwater, and up the Clearwater to its head.\r\n\r\nStarting from the Parsnip and through Rocky mountains, the good country\r\nfor agriculture commences, according to Professor Macoun, at Rocky\r\nmountains portage at Hudson Hope (in British Columbia) or The Hope of\r\nHudson, as Capt. Butler puts it. From that point down the country is\r\nsuitable for agricultural purposes, the whole distance; on the prairie,\r\nnot on the slopes of the river, but on the prairie above. The north bank\r\nof the river, that is the one facing south, has hardly any wood, but is\r\ncovered with berries, and witness found the cactus growing there. The\r\nother side of the river, facing the north, was covered largely with\r\nspruce down to the river’s edge, the whole upward slope. It was only the\r\nbanks of the river that were wooded; above, all was prairie, with poplar\r\nand willow in clumps. It was of the same character as the North\r\nSaskatchewan, but with much taller grass.\r\n\r\nSaid Professor Macoun:—“While at Fort Vermilion, on Peace river, in\r\nlatitude 58° 24′, I was informed by old Mr. Shaw, who had charge of that\r\npost for fifteen years, that\r\n\r\n                        INDIAN CORN WOULD RIPEN\r\n\r\nwell every year there, and at Battle river corn ripened three years in\r\nsuccession, and that frost never injured anything on this part of the\r\nriver. The whole country at Fort Vermilion is a plain, not elevated at\r\nits highest point more than a hundred feet over the river, but the\r\ngreater part of it is less than fifty feet. The soil is wonderfully like\r\nthat of the second prairie steppe, in the prairie region, as the surface\r\nis composed of black loam, mixed apparently with limestone gravel. From\r\nFort Vermilion, Caribou mountains are visible about forty miles off.\r\nThese may have the effect of keeping off the cold winds from Great Slave\r\nlake, and hence the country is permanently warm. Both days and nights\r\nhave been warm down on this part of the river, whereas on the upper\r\nparts, where high banks are, the cold was even felt at night in August.\r\n\r\n“The grain at Fort Vermilion was sown on May 8 and 20, and was cut on\r\nAugust 6. Wheat growing among the barley and by the fences was almost\r\nripe August 12, when I was there. At Rocky mountain portage (British\r\nColumbia), where Peace river issues from Rocky mountains, latitude 56\r\ndegrees, we found a first rate garden with vegetables far advanced, July\r\n21; new potatoes, onions, and carrots were part of our bill of fare.\r\nThat was in 1875. Five days later, at Fort St. John (B.C.) vegetation\r\nwas even further advanced, and all kinds of garden stuff were in the\r\ngreatest perfection. Nigger Dan’s barley was colouring on July 26, and\r\nwould be cut the first week in August. His potatoes were large, and\r\nenough for fourteen men were dug on August 2.\r\n\r\n“I may mention that strawberries were fully ripe on July 6, at Hudson\r\nHope (B.C.). At Dunvegan, barley was almost fit to cut August 4. Cabbage\r\nin the priest’s garden were closing, and all his garden vegetables far\r\nadvanced.\r\n\r\n“At Battle river pease were getting ripe August 8. At Fort Vermilion\r\npotatoes were very large and many heads of barley contained sixty\r\ngrains, others many more. I never saw such fine barley before. Barley\r\nwas sown on May 8 and cut on August 6—that is at latitude 58° 24′. At\r\nRed river (a small fort, fifty or sixty miles below Fort Vermilion),\r\nthey have no ploughs, and the ground was broken up with a spade or hoe.\r\nThe garden stuff\r\n\r\n                       WAS WONDERFULLY LUXURIANT,\r\n\r\npease, Windsor beans and potatoes being far advanced; cucumbers started\r\nand raised in the open air, a very large crop, and a number of them were\r\nripe on August 14.\r\n\r\n“At Chipewyan mission, two miles from the fort, there were wheat, oats\r\nand barley, a good crop as regards grain. Windsor beans were ripe and\r\npulled up on August 17. Wheat and barley were in stock August 26, and\r\nspecimens of these, which I brought to Ottawa, are here on the table.\r\n\r\n“At Red river fort a Frenchman named St. Cyr had a garden, and he told\r\nme he had a particular thing growing in the garden that he did not know\r\nanything about. I went out to look at it, and there was a splendid patch\r\nof cucumbers, many of them ripe. That was in August. I said: ‘These are\r\ncucumbers; how did you start them?’ He said: ‘I got the seed from\r\nEngland and put it in the ground, and that is what has come from it.’\r\n\r\n“I passed down the Athabaska (from Chipewyan) to the Mission, and I\r\nfound growing on soil that would be of no value here whatever, sand and\r\nmuck, an old swamp where they had planted wheat on May 5, and I found it\r\nin the stook on August 26, and brought away from it the grain that was\r\nawarded the bronze medal at Philadelphia in 1876. It was forwarded to\r\nme, but I said that it did not belong to me, but to the missionaries at\r\nAthabaska. I exhibited this very lot of grain in Manitoba before Consul\r\nTaylor and many other gentlemen, and the matter of the number of grains\r\nin the fascicle was then discussed and made public. They took a quantity\r\nof the wheat from me and shelled it, and Mr. Gouin, Inspector of Inland\r\nRevenue, weighed it, and it showed a weight of sixty-eight pounds to the\r\nbushel.[15]\r\n\r\n“The wild pea or vetch grows all through Peace river valley, but was\r\nparticularly noticed on the plateau above Fort St. John (in British\r\nColumbia) in latitude 56°. Here it was actually measured by myself and\r\nwas found to attain a height of eight feet, while the weeds, such as the\r\npurple fire weed of the east (_Epilobium angustifolium_) attained a\r\nheight of seven feet. These are given in illustration of the wonderful\r\nluxuriance of the commoner plants on that high plateau. The vegetation\r\nthroughout the whole Peace river valley is of the most luxuriant\r\ncharacter, and it seems\r\n\r\n                     MORE LIKE THAT OF THE TROPICS\r\n\r\nthan a country drawing near the Arctic Circle.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Macoun explained that in Peace river country, the snow passes\r\noff so easily that as soon as it is off the ground and a few inches of\r\nthe soil thawed, the ground is ready for seeding, because the soil is\r\nfriable and the snow of little depth. The character of the month of\r\nSeptember is almost identical with that of the very best Septembers in\r\nOttawa—a smoky atmosphere with occasional white frosts in the morning,\r\nbut generally a calm atmosphere. In October the frosts get more severe\r\ntowards the last of the month. About the 25th at Chipewyan ice begins to\r\nform and the rivers and lakes soon close.\r\n\r\nProfessor Macoun furnished the committee with some data from notes kept\r\nby Daniel Williams of Fort St. John, commonly known as “Nigger Dan.”\r\nThese notes showed that from 1872 to 1875 the date for planting potatoes\r\nvaried from April 25 to May 10, and for sowing barley and oats from\r\nApril 22 to May 7. After September 22, in 1874, Williams dug over one\r\nhundred bushels of potatoes.\r\n\r\nWilliam Ogilvie, D.L.S. (See p. 18) in his report of 1884,\r\nwrote:—“Opposite Fort Vermilion, on the north of the river, there is an\r\nextensive tract of prairie and poplar bluff country, which extends from\r\nthe Peace to the watershed between Peace and Mackenzie rivers,\r\nsouthwestward along the Peace for about forty miles or more, and\r\nnortheastward along the river a few miles, until it merges into the\r\ncountry already described. This is said to be a first class country in\r\nevery way, well wooded and watered, with a rich, deep, black loamy clay\r\nsoil; and if the life of flowers and berries be any indication of\r\nfreedom from frost, this district is favoured in this respect, as the\r\nberries ripen here when they are killed in the surrounding parts.\r\n\r\n“The country southwestward from the end of this tract to Battle river is\r\ndescribed as woods and swamps, alternating with patches of prairie and\r\nopen woods, and from Battle river to the prairie near Dunvegan,\r\ngenerally drier and with more prairie.\r\n\r\n“It appears, therefore, that from Dunvegan, on the north side of Peace\r\nriver, down the river to Peace point, and thence to Salt river on the\r\nGreat Slave, there is a tract of country about six hundred miles in\r\nlength and forty miles wide, of which a large percentage is fit for\r\nimmediate settlement, and a great deal more could be very easily closed.\r\n\r\n“Of the country southeast of the Peace, between it and the Athabaska,\r\nvery little is known. It was described by all whom I met, who had seen\r\nany portion of it, as a rolling surface, the ridges heavily wooded with\r\nfair timber, and many of the basins containing swamps and lakes of\r\nconsiderable size. Out of one of the latter, Lake Wapisca, Loon river\r\nflows into the Peace, and another stream called by the same name into\r\nthe Athabaska, at Grand rapids. Some of the ridges rise into high hills,\r\nand in some of these, rock exposures are said to be visible.\r\n\r\n“At Dunvegan, notwithstanding the severity of the frosts, the crops were\r\nvery good, both in quality and quantity. When I was there, the Roman\r\nCatholic missionaries\r\n\r\n                       HAD THRESHED THEIR GRAIN,\r\n\r\nsamples of which I brought back. The yield was as follows:—Fifty pounds\r\nof wheat were sown on April 16 and reaped on August 20, and twenty-seven\r\nbushels threshed of good clean grain; fifteen pounds of Egyptian barley\r\nsown on April 18 and reaped August 20, and fifteen bushels threshed,\r\nweighing fully sixty pounds to the bushel. The Hudson’s Bay Company and\r\nthe Church of England mission had not threshed, and could not give their\r\nreturns, but they were well satisfied with their crops of all kinds. The\r\nReverend Mr. Brick, of the Church of England mission, was already using\r\nbread, when I was there, made from wheat of the present year’s growth.”\r\n\r\nMr. Ogilvie in his 1891 report wrote as follows:—\r\n\r\n“For a distance of six or seven miles back from Peace river valley there\r\nis much prairie and meadowland, with some woods and swamps scattered\r\nover it. The soil is an excellent black clay loam as rich as any I ever\r\nsaw, and the growth of hay and grass bears testimony to this fact. The\r\ndip of the valley from this plain is very sharp and the banks very\r\nsteep, falling about eight hundred feet in a mile.\r\n\r\n“At Fort St. John the Hudson’s Bay Company have a small patch on which\r\nthey raise potatoes and garden stuff along with barley and oats. The\r\ngrain always ripens and the vegetables are as good as one would wish to\r\nuse. Mr. Gunn, the officer in charge here, has been in Peace river\r\ndistrict since 1883, and in the interval he has wandered around the\r\nadjacent country a good deal.\r\n\r\n“The Hudson’s Bay Company have several bands of horses in the vicinity\r\nof Fort St. John, only a few of which have ever been broken. These\r\nanimals live on the prairie on the north side of the river, winter and\r\nsummer, and\r\n\r\n                   VERY SELDOM ARE THERE ANY LOSSES,\r\n\r\nexcept by wolves, or when the Indians are starving they may quietly\r\ndispose of one or two and report them lost.\r\n\r\n“At Dunvegan, the Company has grown wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, and\r\ngarden stuff generally for many years with astonishing success. When I\r\nwas there in 1883-84, I saw grain and vegetables fully equal in quality\r\nand quantity to any I have ever seen anywhere, the garden vegetables\r\nbeing especially fine. Last year everything was harvested and stored\r\nwhen I got there, but what I saw of the produce was excellent. I saw two\r\nsunflowers which measured fourteen inches across the disc. With the\r\ncorolla attached, these flowers would have been nearly two feet in\r\ndiameter. The seeds of each weighed fourteen ounces and measured nearly\r\na quart. A head of cabbage was shown from which I stripped off all the\r\nloose leaves leaving it fit for cooking and then measured and weighed\r\nit. It measured fifty-three and one-half inches in circumference, and\r\nweighed twenty-eight and one-half lbs. This was an exceptionally large\r\nhead, of course, but the general run of both cabbage and cauliflower was\r\nlarge and would be considered so anywhere. Mr. Round, the officer in\r\ncharge of the post, told me he two years ago made a departure from the\r\nold fashioned method of growing these plants, and instead of developing\r\nthem in hot beds, he simply planted the seed once for all in drills in\r\nthe garden, and when they arrived at the proper stage, pulled out the\r\nsuperfluous ones. He found this method just as satisfactory and much\r\nless troublesome. The other garden vegetables were just as large and\r\ngood as one would wish to see them. Mr. Round informed me he planted\r\nfifteen bushels of potatoes last summer, and after using them freely for\r\nthe sustenance of his family (five members) and the servants, in all\r\neight or ten, from the time they were fit for use, until they were\r\nharvested, he harvested upwards of two hundred bushels. He sowed about\r\nfour bushels of wheat, and though the dry season much affected the\r\nresult he would have about sixty bushels. This grain is used in various\r\nways, some of it being ground into flour by the aid of small hand mills.\r\nHe sowed four bushels of oats, and though part of the crop was destroyed\r\nby a hail storm, one hundred bushels were threshed. In 1890 he planted\r\ntwenty-five bushels of potatoes, and though they were freely used from\r\nthe time they were fit for use until harvested, seven hundred and twelve\r\nbushels were harvested. The Anglican and Roman Catholic missions here\r\nalso successfully raise both grain and vegetables, the latter depending\r\nfor much of their subsistence on the results of their agricultural\r\nlabours.\r\n\r\n“This post has been in existence for the greater part of a century, and\r\nmore or less farming has always been done at it during that time.”\r\n\r\nMr. Ogilvie embodied in his report a number of extracts from the\r\nDunvegan post journal which are interesting as conveying an idea of the\r\n\r\n                 CLIMATE AND THE GROWTH OF VEGETATION.\r\n\r\nSome of these extracts are worth requoting here:—\r\n\r\n“1829. Ice began to move in the river April 12. Sowed barley April 17;\r\nplanted potatoes April 30; cut barley August 10; cut wheat August 25;\r\nharvested potatoes September 24; first snow October 21; first drift ice\r\nOctober 24.\r\n\r\n“1830. Ice broke up April 28; sowed thirty quarts of wheat May 3; sowed\r\ngarden seeds May 4; planted potatoes May 5; cut wheat September 14;\r\ncommenced digging potatoes September 27; first drift ice October 29; ice\r\nset fast November 25.\r\n\r\n“1886. Ice started to break up April 13; sowed barley May 12; planted\r\nturnips May 13; planted potatoes May 17; began harvesting operations\r\nAugust 20; cut buckwheat September 2; harvested potatoes September 23;\r\nstored nine hundred and eighty-four bushels; slight snow October 12;\r\nfirst ice drifting November 10; ice set fast November 30.\r\n\r\n“1887. Ice started April 27; sowed oats April 29; sowed other seed May\r\n2; commenced planting potatoes May 5; sowed garden seeds May 9; sowed\r\npeas May 11; finished planting potatoes May 28; planted fifty bushels;\r\nsevere frost June 7, injuring young vegetables, etc., severe frost again\r\non June 25, cutting down everything to the ground, potatoes and all;\r\nJuly 29 new potatoes for the first time; first snow fell on September\r\n16; commenced taking up potatoes September 20; harvested six hundred and\r\neighteen bushels; took up turnips and carrots September 5; first drift\r\nice in river October 24, but it cleared out again and returned November\r\n12; set fast November 29.\r\n\r\n“1888. Ice moved May 1; began sowing barley May 9; began planting\r\npotatoes May 10; sowed oats and wheat May 15; sowed garden seeds May 16;\r\nsowed turnips May 28; slight frost August 1, injured garden stuff; cut\r\nbarley September 5; cut oats September 7; started taking up potatoes\r\nSeptember 27; finished October 3, five hundred and twenty-nine bushels;\r\ntook up turnips October 5; first snow October 15; first ice in river\r\nOctober 27; ice set fast November 27.”\r\n\r\nMr. Ogilvie continues, in his report:—\r\n\r\n“I would now call particular attention to the mention of frost in June,\r\n1887, and to the fact that it cut down vegetables to the ground. Alone\r\nthere is nothing very wonderful about the statement, as it is just what\r\nwe would expect frost to do; but in conjunction with using new potatoes\r\nfor the first time on July 29, just one month after the frost, and the\r\nfurther fact that\r\n\r\n            SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN BUSHELS WERE HARVESTED,\r\n\r\nit is most astonishing. Mr. Round, the officer who made the entry, was a\r\nwitness of the event, and he is a gentleman whose sanity I would as soon\r\ndoubt as his word. I questioned him about it and he assured me\r\nemphatically of its correctness. He can offer no explanations, if it is\r\nnot that a fog generally settles on the river valley after a frost and\r\nshields plants from the direct rays of the sun a good part of the day;\r\nbut even that does not account for this case, as he assures me the\r\npotatoes were cut down, black, to the ground.\r\n\r\n“The Reverend J. G. Brick, Anglican missionary, who spent some time at\r\nDunvegan, combining farming with mission work, in 1886 started what\r\nmight be called a branch farm at Old Wives lake, about thirty-six miles\r\nfrom Dunvegan, on the cart trail, between the latter place and Smoky\r\nriver crossing, on the plateau above the immediate valley of the river.\r\nReference will be made to this later.\r\n\r\n“In 1889, he established himself in the valley of the river on the north\r\nside, about five miles above the mouth of Smoky river. Here he has\r\nestablished a mission and a school for the education of the young, on\r\nwhich he bases all his hopes for the improvement of the natives. He\r\nkeeps this school open during the winter months, and as an inducement to\r\nattend, he gives all the children who live at a distance their dinner.\r\n\r\n“This gentleman took in with him a large outfit of farm implements and\r\nstock. He has a small grist mill and threshing mill, with which he\r\nthreshes and grinds his grain. By grinding his wheat twice it makes a\r\nfair article of flour, but his facilities for bolting it are not quite\r\nup to the times, consequently his flour is not quite so white as our\r\nhigh grade flour, but it makes good bread, nevertheless.\r\n\r\n“He is well satisfied with his success agriculturally. He furnished me\r\nwith the following information relative to his doings in 1891:—\r\n\r\n“Began ploughing April 11; sowed first wheat April 15; ice broke up\r\nApril 20; river cleared April 26; commenced harvesting August 20; cut\r\nwheat August 27; about nineteen acres under grain, total yield six\r\nhundred and ninety-eight bushels.\r\n\r\n           WHEAT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BUSHELS ON SIX ACRES;\r\n\r\noats two hundred bushels, barley two hundred and twenty-six bushels.\r\nAfter all the grain was removed he raked the field and got twenty-two\r\nbushels of grain from the rakings. He sowed two varieties of wheat,\r\nLadoga, and wheat he got in Manitoba, which he thinks is Red Fife, but\r\nis not sure; both are beautiful specimens of grain. He has some\r\ntwo-rowed barley which he procured while in England in 1888, when he\r\nobtained one pound. The yield in 1891 was six hundred pounds of as fine,\r\nclean, bright and plump grain as could be seen elsewhere.\r\n\r\n“His Ladoga wheat was sown April 21 and harvested August 24, but he\r\nallowed it to over-ripen, and thinks he lost at least four or five\r\nbushels while harvesting. He sowed ninety pounds and threshed one\r\nthousand five hundred. He obtained a sample of black Norway oats from\r\nWebb and Company, England, which he sowed on five-eighths of an acre of\r\nground, last year. When harvesting it was all drawn off the field in one\r\nwagon load, and when threshed it turned out sixty-four bushels of\r\nfirst-class grain. Last year he tried Indian corn; it did not ripen, but\r\nyielded excellent green corn; cucumbers were grown successfully, but did\r\nnot ripen. Yet I saw as good pumpkins fully developed both here and at\r\nDunvegan as one would wish for.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Brick has about forty head of cattle, and several horses; last fall\r\non my arrival there he had about forty pigs, but killed some during my\r\nstay, and only intended to winter about twenty-five. He employs a good\r\ndeal of local labour, and pays for it with food to a very large extent;\r\nin fact it is the only way it could be paid for in the country. The hay\r\nfor wintering the cattle and horses is cut on the plateau about seven\r\nmiles from the farm. He generally allows his cattle to run out until\r\nChristmas, the grass on the meadows being enough for them to feed on it\r\nafter the early snows have fallen. The horses not kept in for use are\r\nwintered out. The Hudson’s Bay Company at Dunvegan have about one\r\nhundred and fifty wild horses, and the Roman Catholic mission and the\r\nIndians also have many which always winter out on the plains north of\r\nthe Post, which affords them both food and shelter, as the country\r\nbetween Dunvegan and Smoky river, crossing on the north side, is\r\nparticularly park-like prairie to a distance of twelve to twenty miles\r\nback from the river. The woods afford them shelter and on the prairies\r\nthe rich grasses grow. There are also large areas\r\n\r\n                       WHERE EXCELLENT HAY GROWS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flour Mill at Fort Vermilion.]\r\n\r\nNo other attention is, or has been, given to these animals than to\r\noccasionally send a man out to hunt them up and count them. This is not\r\nso difficult a task as it would seem, as they run in bands; each band\r\nconsists of mares and a stallion, who will give fight to the death for\r\nhis mares. Each band is known by the name of its stallion, and as each\r\nkeeps pretty well in the one locality, it is not so difficult to keep\r\ntrack of them as it would appear. I saw several bands on my way from\r\nDunvegan and all were very fat, notwithstanding that the cold winter\r\nweather had set in a month before, and the snow had been a foot deep for\r\nten or twelve days. ‘Chinook’ winds occasionally visit this part of the\r\ncountry and carry the snow off; here also they blow from the southwest.\r\nThe approach of one is known some little time before it arrives by the\r\nroar it makes. Many people in the country call them the ‘high-winds’\r\nthey blow so strongly. They often visit Lesser Slave lake.”\r\n\r\nMr. R. G. McConnell of the Geological Survey, in the report of his visit\r\nto the country, wrote in 1888:—“Vegetables of various kinds are grown\r\nyearly without difficulty, at Fort Vermilion, Lesser Slave lake,\r\nWhitefish lake and Trout lake, while potatoes are grown by the Indians\r\neven on the summit of Birch mountain, at a height of two thousand three\r\nhundred feet above the sea. Wheat and other cereals have been fairly\r\nsuccessful at Lesser Slave lake and at Fort Vermilion, the only places\r\nwhere they have been tried. The prairie country round Fort Vermilion\r\nequals in fertility the famous Edmonton district and appears to enjoy an\r\nequally good climate, its higher latitude being compensated for by its\r\nmore western situation and by its lower elevation. This district is\r\nabout one thousand feet above the sea. In the interior, narrow strips of\r\naspen-covered, but excellent land, are usually found along the main\r\nrivers, and surrounding many of the lakes, and numerous areas, often\r\n\r\n                   EQUAL IN SIZE TO EASTERN COUNTIES,\r\n\r\nmight be selected, which appear well adapted for cultivation, but the\r\nnumerous swamps, muskegs and marshes which separate these areas detract\r\ngreatly from their value. The western, and especially the northwestern,\r\nportion of this district contains the most promising agricultural\r\nlands.”\r\n\r\nMr. McConnell, before the Senate committee of 1907, explained that his\r\nexploratory work in Peace river country had been mostly along the\r\nstreams. He had, however, been over quite a bit of the tableland. He had\r\nnearly always gone back from the river quite a bit, twenty or thirty and\r\nforty miles in places. From Lesser Slave lake he started on foot with a\r\ncouple of men packing, and went through all the country between Lesser\r\nSlave lake and Big Knife lake, a distance of about one hundred and fifty\r\nmiles. His mission was specially to look for minerals, but, of course,\r\nhe was supposed to keep his eyes open for anything. As to the extent of\r\nland suitable for cultivation in Peace river country, Mr. McConnell said\r\nthere are aspen ridges all through that country which may be good, but\r\nthey are separated by muskegs everywhere, except on the table prairie.\r\nThese muskegs occur with solid ground in between them, and in those\r\nplaces aspens grow, and where those poplars are found the land is nearly\r\nalways good. But the poplars do not grow to any size. The aspen is not\r\non the prairie; it is on the wooded country, in between the muskegs.\r\nBesides there are occasional patches of prairie at Fort Vermilion,\r\nfollowing Peace river down, and also Grande prairie. There is no large\r\ncontinuous prairie thirty miles from Edmonton towards the north. There\r\nare occasional patches of prairie tableland with only small areas of\r\nbottom land. The tableland decreases in height as going northward.\r\nFarther down the Vermilion the prairie begins again. At Fort Vermilion\r\nthe country is not so much subject to frost as in the higher land. Wheat\r\nhas been grown there a great number of years. In the valley of the river\r\nthe low land on each side is fertile. There is no great quantity of it\r\non either bank. There are just these flats. Taking the aggregate it is a\r\nlarge quantity because it is a tremendously long river. The valley is\r\nprobably a mile wide on both sides of the river.\r\n\r\nGrande prairie, in upper Peace country, which is\r\n\r\n                    ABOUT SEVENTY-FIVE MILES ACROSS,\r\n\r\nis probably the largest area of open country, and there is a prairie\r\nfollowing Peace river about twenty-five miles. That disappears going\r\ndown Peace river, and the country is wooded and partly muskeg as far as\r\nFort Vermilion. Then there is another small prairie area. Taking the\r\nupper stretches of the country, northward forty miles from the river,\r\nthe country is partly muskeg. Travelling across it with horses, one\r\nwould run into a muskeg every couple of miles, and there are ridges only\r\na few feet higher than the muskegs, and they are nearly always covered\r\nwith poplar, and those ridges seem to be fairly good agricultural land.\r\nBut they are always separated by these muskeg lands. This muskeg is very\r\ndeep. Mr. McConnell had had horses go down in it. Along all the streams\r\nthere is a certain amount of good land. There are a great many streams\r\nin that country, and in the aggregate the amount of water is large.\r\n\r\nAs to Grande prairie, or north Peace river country, the soil is very\r\ngood there. There is a subsoil. It is a good wheat country, and in June\r\nand July it is looked upon as the best wheat country in the world. He\r\nhad noticed the pea vine growing in that section, and so far as he could\r\njudge from going over it, the country is a good agricultural one, except\r\nfor frosts. There happened to be some frosts both times he was there,\r\nbut apart from that the country is certainly good. There is swamp grass\r\ngrowing about the margins of the small lakes. It was after the middle of\r\nthe month of August that he experienced frost there. He did not know\r\nmuch about the growing of vegetables in Peace river country.\r\n\r\nMr. McConnell considered that at that date the value of Peace river\r\ncountry as a whole as far as wheat-growing was concerned, was entirely\r\nproblematical. If one went there in June or July he would come to the\r\nconclusion that it is the finest country in the whole wide world, but he\r\nhimself had been there twice in August and found a heavy frost on each\r\noccasion. Things changed very rapidly about the end of August. He did\r\nnot know if there would be frost about the same time around Edmonton,\r\nbut the two years he happened to be in Peace river district there would\r\nbe about fifteen degrees of frost at night. That was in the elevated,\r\ncattle country, which is considered higher than the surface of Peace\r\nriver. There were no crops there at that time. The soil in that district\r\nis splendid. It is precisely the same as the country around Edmonton. It\r\nmight be good for the growing of hay, or in fact anything. There is no\r\nquestion that the soil is good, and in June and July it is a\r\n\r\n                        MOST ATTRACTIVE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nHe went down Loon river, and found much of the country in there partly\r\nmuskeg; in fact, the greater part of it is muskeg; but there are patches\r\nof country covered with aspen, which is probably good for agriculture.\r\nHe went all the way down Loon river and Red river, which flows into\r\nPeace river, and another unnamed stream, and found it was a prairie\r\ncountry down there. There is a grist mill at Vermilion, and a large\r\nquantity of wheat is sent there. The wheat is all grown in that\r\nvicinity. That country is too good a country to be wasted. The valleys\r\nare protected from the wind, and the theory is that it is less liable to\r\nfrost on account of the wind being kept away. There is a magnificent\r\ngrowth of grass on the plateau, and there is hay in the marshes. It is\r\nvery much the same country as that around Edmonton. It is a good place\r\nfor raising cattle, but they probably would have to feed them in the\r\nwinter time, as they do at Edmonton. Sheep ought to do well. They\r\nappeared to have a fair rainfall. He thought that as far as the country\r\nis concerned it is very much the same as Edmonton. It is well watered.\r\n\r\nMr. McConnell concluded that a farmer might succeed there even if he\r\ncould not grow wheat, if he could get a market. That was the only thing\r\nthat would prevent him from succeeding, he thought.\r\n\r\nMuch evidence as to the agricultural possibilities and climate of the\r\nPeace country was taken by the Senate committee of 1888 (See p. 28).\r\n\r\nHon. William Christie, formerly Inspecting Chief Factor of the Hudson’s\r\nBay Company, in his examination before the committee, expressed himself\r\nsanguine about the agricultural possibilities of Peace river country,\r\nwhich he considered “is one of the finest countries that you would wish\r\nto see. Upper Peace river country is as fine a country as I ever saw.”\r\nHe did not think Peace river country subject to droughts at all, but the\r\nwinter snow disappeared much more rapidly than it did in Manitoba. The\r\nvegetation in Peace river country is very luxuriant; the grass is more\r\nlike that of Manitoba than that of Saskatchewan. He thought the wheat\r\ncrop would be as certain in upper Peace river district as in the\r\nSaskatchewan district. Farther down, at Lac la Biche, they never have\r\nwheat frozen; that may be affected by the temperature of the lake water.\r\nOn upper Peace river they are less subject to frost. He had always\r\nunderstood that wheat grew well at Dunvegan.\r\n\r\nAt Fort Vermilion there was a splendid country. He once rode with\r\nGovernor Dallas sixty miles through a most magnificent country. The soil\r\nwas a beautiful dark loam, as they could see by the mole hills, and they\r\nwere struck with the charming appearance of the country. There were more\r\nbluffs than were found on the Saskatchewan, and it was a beautiful\r\ncountry all the way up to Dunvegan. Where the country was open, the\r\ngrass was higher than on the Saskatchewan. It was not very long—about\r\nthe same as in Manitoba. As to the testing of the capacity of the\r\ncountry for agriculture, he explained that a good deal had depended upon\r\nthe characters of the officers in charge of the various forts whether\r\nthe capacity of the country in the vicinity for agriculture was tested.\r\nIn the journals of long ago he found that they used to raise splendid\r\nwheat crops at Dunvegan, and cattle. Another officer, without any taste\r\nfor agriculture, going in there might find it very difficult to live. If\r\nhe had no taste for gardening or agriculture, nothing would be raised. A\r\ngreat deal depended on the officer of the post whether he lived well or\r\nnot. If he was active and energetic he would always live very well.\r\n\r\nWitness agreed with the remark that there is enough good land in Peace\r\nriver country\r\n\r\n                        TO MAKE A NEW PROVINCE.\r\n\r\nG. M. Dawson, M.D., LL.D., at the time Assistant Director of the\r\nGeological Survey of Canada, was examined by the committee and explained\r\nthat he had personal acquaintance with the Athabaska from Athabaska to\r\nBaptiste river; with Peace river valley from Smoky river to the\r\nheadwaters; and with the country between the above designated portions\r\nof rivers.\r\n\r\nQuoting from a report he had prepared in 1879-80, on the extent of\r\narable and pastoral lands in the region of Peace and Athabaska rivers,\r\nDoctor Dawson showed that Peace river basin comprised an area of about\r\nthirty-one thousand five hundred and fifty square miles. Its average\r\nelevation may be stated as a little over two thousand feet, and this is\r\nmaintained with considerable uniformity, for though the general surface\r\nslopes slightly from the north and south towards Peace river, the region\r\nas a whole may be considered as a plateau, through which the great\r\ngorge-like valley of the Peace has been excavated. This valley has in\r\ngeneral a depth of six hundred to eight hundred feet below that part of\r\nthe plateau bordering it, with a width of two or three miles from rim to\r\nrim. Its tributary streams, at first nearly on the plateau level, flow\r\nin valleys of continually increasing depth as they approach that of\r\nPeace river. Those from the southeastern portion of the region rise\r\neither in Rocky mountains or near the Athabaska, the tributaries\r\nreceived by the latter stream, in this part of its course, from the\r\nnorth and northwest being—with the exception of the Baptiste—quite\r\ninconsiderable.\r\n\r\nThe ridges and hills by which this region is occasionally diversified,\r\nappear in all cases to be composed either of the generally soft rocks of\r\nthe cretaceous, or of arenaceous clays containing erratics and\r\nrepresenting the boulder clays of the glacial period. These elevations\r\nare generally slight, and with exceedingly slight, and gradual slopes,\r\nthe scarped banks of the streams constituting much more important\r\nirregularities. These ridges, however, often resemble detached portions\r\nof a higher plateau, and spread widely enough to occupy in the aggregate\r\na considerable area, of which the soil is not so uniform in character as\r\nelsewhere. With these exceptions, the soil of the district may be\r\ndescribed as a fine silt, resembling the\r\n\r\n                   WHITE SILTS OF THE NECHACCO BASIN,\r\n\r\nand not dissimilar from the loess-like material constituting the subsoil\r\nof Red river valley in Manitoba. This silt at a short distance below the\r\nsurface, is greyish or brownish in colour, but becomes mixed\r\nsuperficially with a proportion of vegetable matter to a varying depth.\r\nIt has evidently been deposited by a comparatively tranquil body of\r\nwater not loaded with ice, probably toward the close of the glacial\r\nperiod, and has either never been laid down on the ridges and\r\nundulations above referred to, or has been since removed from them by\r\nprocesses of waste. As evidenced by the natural vegetation its fertility\r\nis great.\r\n\r\nWest of Smoky river, both to the south and north of Peace river, there\r\nare extensive areas of prairie country, either entirely open, and\r\ncovered with a more or less luxuriant growth of grass, or dotted with\r\npatches of coppice and groves of trees. The northern banks of Peace\r\nriver valley are also very generally open and grassed, and parts of the\r\nvalley of the Smoky and other rivers have a similar character. The total\r\narea of prairie land west of the Smoky may be about three thousand\r\nsquare miles.\r\n\r\nThough the prairies are most immediately available, from an agricultural\r\npoint of view, the regions now covered with second growth and forest,\r\nwhere the soil itself is not inferior, will eventually be equally\r\nvaluable. The largest tract of poor land is that bordering the valley of\r\nthe Athabaska on the north. This rises to an elevation considerably\r\ngreater than most of the region to the north and west, and appears,\r\nduring the submergence to which the superficial deposits are due, to\r\nhave been exposed to stronger currents which have prevented the\r\ndeposition of fine silt, causing it to be replaced by a coarser silt\r\nwhich passes in places into actual sand, and alternates with ridges of\r\nboulder clay. This region is often swampy, and, for a width of twenty to\r\ntwenty-five miles on the trail from Sturgeon lake to Athabaska, is quite\r\nunsuited for agriculture, though still in many places capable of\r\nyielding good summer grazing when the forest has been completely removed\r\nby fire. To the northward, more particularly to the east of Smoky river,\r\npeaty and mossy swamps occupy part of the surface, and these may be\r\nregarded as permanently unsuited to agriculture.\r\n\r\nThere is also a sandy tract, though of small width, along the lower part\r\nof Wapiti river near its junction with the Smoky. Deducting as far as\r\npossible all the areas known to be inferior or useless, with about\r\ntwenty per cent. for the portions of the region under consideration of\r\nwhich less is known, the total area of land, with soil suited to\r\nagriculture, may be estimated as\r\n\r\n       AT LEAST TWENTY-THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE MILES.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of complete maps, such an estimate cannot be otherwise\r\nthan very rough, but may serve to give some idea of the fact.\r\n\r\nDoctor Dawson expressed the opinion that “the truly wonderful luxuriance\r\nof the natural vegetation in Peace valley prairies indicated, not alone\r\nthe fertility of the soil, but the occurrences of a sufficient\r\nrainfall.”\r\n\r\nHe went on to explain that the summer season of 1879 was an unusual one,\r\ncharacterized by excessively heavy rainfall, with cold raw weather in\r\nthe early summer months. These conditions did not extend to the west of\r\nRocky mountains, but appeared to have been felt over the entire area of\r\nthe plains to Red river valley. As a result of this, the crops generally\r\nthroughout the Northwest were later than usual, and the mean temperature\r\nof even the latter part of the summer appears to be rather abnormally\r\nlow. Notwithstanding this, on Doctor Dawson’s arrival at Dunvegan, on\r\nAugust 16, small patches of wheat and barley in the garden of the fort\r\npresented a remarkably fine appearance and were beginning to turn\r\nyellow. On his return to the fort on August 31, these were being\r\nharvested, their complete ripening having been delayed by overcast and\r\nchilly weather which prevailed between these dates. At the\r\nfirst-mentioned date potatoes were quite ripe, with the balls formed on\r\nthe stalks, and the garden contained also fine cabbage, beets, carrots,\r\nonions, lettuce and turnips. Dwarf beans, cucumbers and squashes were\r\nalso flourishing and, though these plants are particularly tender,\r\nshowed no signs of frost. The two last-named, having been sown in the\r\nopen ground, did not appear likely to perfect their fruit. A few stalks\r\nof Indian corn were also growing, though it is improbable that this\r\ncereal would ripen in this district. When this garden was again visited,\r\non the last day of August, the beans, cucumbers, and squashes had been\r\ncut down by frost, but not completely killed. The potato tops were also\r\nslightly nipped.\r\n\r\nRev. Mr. Tessier, who had been at Dunvegan as a missionary for some\r\nyears, had always been\r\n\r\n                ABLE TO RIPEN SMALL, BLACK BUTTER BEANS,\r\n\r\nbut in some seasons not without difficulty, owing to frosts. He had also\r\ntried a few grains of oats, which he procured accidentally, and obtained\r\na return of astonishing abundance. About the date just referred to, the\r\npotato plants of Smoky river post (The Forks) were badly cut down by\r\nfrost, the tubers being, however, quite ripe, fine and large.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View on Halfway river.]\r\n\r\nDoctor Dawson pointed out that Mr. Horetzky had been told that the\r\nplains were often nearly bare up to the month of December, though the\r\nwinter usually sets in with the month of November. Sir Alexander\r\nMackenzie remarked the same absence of snow in the early winter months\r\nof 1792. It was entirely gone on April 5, 1793, and gnats and mosquitoes\r\nwere troublesome on April 20. Horses almost invariably wintered out well\r\nwithout requiring to be fed. Hay should be provided for cattle, to\r\nensure perfect safety, for a period of three or four months, though in\r\nsome seasons it was necessary to feed the animals for a few weeks only.\r\nThe Indians of ‘Cree Settlement’ on Sturgeon lake wintered their horses\r\nwithout any difficulty round the borders of a neighbouring lake, the\r\nshores of which were partly open. From Hudson Hope, the horses were sent\r\nsouthward to Moberly lake to winter, and according to Mr. Selwyn, did\r\nwell there. Lesser Slave lake, with its wonderful natural meadows, has\r\nlong been known as an excellent place for wintering stock, and was\r\nreferred to as such by Sir J. Richardson.\r\n\r\nFrom such comparison as could be made, according to Doctor Dawson, it\r\nwould be premature to allow that the climate of Peace river was inferior\r\nto that of the region about Edmonton on the Saskatchewan. It was true,\r\nhe admitted, that in both Saskatchewan and Peace river districts the\r\nseason was none too long for the cultivation of wheat, but if the crop\r\ncould be counted on as a sure one—and experience even then seemed to\r\nindicate that it might—the occurrence of early and late frosts might be\r\n\r\n                REGARDED WITH COMPARATIVE INDIFFERENCE.\r\n\r\nThe season was at least equally short throughout the whole fertile belt\r\nfrom Peace river to Manitoba, though early and late frosts were not so\r\ncommon in the low valley of Red river.\r\n\r\nThe almost simultaneous advance of spring along the whole line of this\r\nfertile belt, Doctor Dawson pointed out, was indicated by the dates of\r\nthe flowering of the various plants, a point referred to by him in some\r\ndetail elsewhere. It was further unquestionable that the winter was less\r\nsevere, and not subject to the same extremes in Peace river and upper\r\nSaskatchewan regions as in Manitoba.\r\n\r\nScientists, Doctor Dawson remarked, had already found reason to believe\r\nthat the early and late frosts, and not the absence of a sufficient\r\naggregate amount of heat, constituted the limiting condition of wheat\r\nculture in the Northwest, but that neither Saskatchewan nor Peace river\r\ncountries lay upon the actual verge of the profitable cultivation of\r\nwheat appeared to be proved by the fact that oats succeeded on the\r\nSaskatchewan, and also—in so far as one or two seasons could be\r\naccepted as evidence—on Peace river; while it was well known that this\r\ncereal is less tolerant of summer frost than wheat.\r\n\r\nThis, Doctor Dawson remarked, is further proved by the fact that at Fort\r\nVermilion and Athabaska lake, one hundred and eighty and three hundred\r\nmiles, respectively, northeast of Dunvegan, Professor Macoun had found\r\nwheat and barley ripening well, but in this instance the fact was\r\ncomplicated by the circumstance of the decreasing altitude of the\r\ncountry, which introduced a new condition.\r\n\r\n                 DOCTOR DAWSON’S STRIKING ILLUSTRATION.\r\n\r\nTo give some idea of the value of a tract of generally fertile country,\r\nsuch as that described, Doctor Dawson remarked: “Let us assume, as\r\nabove, that the area of actually cultivable land is twenty-three\r\nthousand five hundred square miles, or fifteen million one hundred and\r\nforty thousand acres. Let us suppose for simplicity of calculation, that\r\nthe whole area were sown in wheat, the yield, at the rate of twenty\r\nbushels to the acre, would be three hundred million, eight hundred\r\nthousand bushels.”\r\n\r\nThe Reverend J. Gough Brick, for many years in charge of the Church of\r\nEngland mission at Dunvegan on upper Peace river, submitted some\r\ninteresting evidence in writing to the committee. He stated that on his\r\nmission farm he had ploughed on April 8, and sown wheat on April 12, and\r\nthat wheat was cut about August 20. Wheat was generally sown from April\r\n12 to May 1, and harvested at the end of August. The barley was sown\r\nfrom May 10 to May 20, and harvested at the end of August. The time for\r\nsowing and reaping oats was the same as wheat. Potatoes were planted\r\nabout May 16 and dug in September. Turnips planted at same date were\r\ngathered October 10. The Hudson’s Bay Company had done a little farming,\r\nin connection with other posts, at Dunvegan, Fort St. John, Hudson Hope\r\nand Fort Vermilion, for very many years. Witness supposed that at\r\nDunvegan they had raised wheat, barley and potatoes for seventy-five to\r\none hundred years, and seldom had the crops turned out a total failure.\r\nIn 1884, he went up on to the height of the prairie country, some\r\nthirty-six miles from Dunvegan, and broke up about three acres for an\r\nexperiment. In 1885 the crop on the land, only once ploughed, was fairly\r\ngood. In 1886 there was a magnificent crop of wheat, barley, peas,\r\npotatoes, turnips and all other vegetables. In 1887, he was sorry to\r\nsay, the crop there was a total failure. A frost on July 26 killed out\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary prairie grasses, with wild vetches and pea-vine, were found\r\nin abundance, growing more or less all over the country. The soil was a\r\nblack loam, a large percentage he considered fit for grain, the rest for\r\npasturage. They had no insect pests in upper Peace country. The Indians\r\nwere raising a considerable quantity of potatoes. A few were raising a\r\nlittle barley and wheat.\r\n\r\nMr. Brick informed the committee that he considered the climate of Peace\r\nriver country as\r\n\r\n                        THE FINEST IN THE WORLD.\r\n\r\nThe usual snowfall in Peace river is from eighteen inches to three feet.\r\nIce begins to run in Peace river about November 5, but some seasons\r\nremain open until December 20. It generally breaks up about April 10 to\r\n15. The prevailing wind is from the southwest, and during the winter the\r\nChinook winds prevail in upper Peace river country. The three growing\r\nmonths are very dry until about the middle of July; then some seasons\r\nthey get considerable rain. There were summer frosts some seasons; but\r\nstill they were not so destructive in Peace river country as farther\r\nsouth. These frosts were purely local, and witness thought that were the\r\ncountry settled they would be less likely to occur. The early part of\r\nthe summer is generally dry, while the weather in September and October\r\nis very pleasant indeed.\r\n\r\nSome interesting information was communicated to the committee by Mr.\r\nFrank Oliver, then editor of the Edmonton Bulletin and member of the old\r\nNorthwest Council. Mr. Oliver explained that most of his information was\r\nacquired from Mr. Murdock McLeod formerly of the Hudson’s Bay Company’s\r\nservice. Peace river country, according to this witness, was especially\r\nnoted for its abundant supply of berries of excellent quality. Although\r\nberries of all kinds mentioned were plentiful in the upper Saskatchewan,\r\nIndians used formerly to travel to Peace river, some two hundred and\r\nfifty miles, to avail themselves of the supply there. Successive years\r\nof experiment had demonstrated the practicability of the growth of\r\nwheat, barley, oats and potatoes, at Dunvegan, Fort Vermilion and\r\nChipewyan, the two latter in latitude 58½°.\r\n\r\nThere has been considerable exploitation of the agricultural\r\npossibilities of Peace country since 1888, and we now have data which\r\ntend to show that the faith of the pioneer farmers of the country was\r\nnot misplaced. Much interesting information, as to more recent\r\nagricultural enterprise in the country drained by the Peace, was\r\nobtained from witnesses examined before the select committee of the\r\nSenate of Canada in 1907.\r\n\r\nFred Lawrence, F.R.G.S., Justice of the Peace, etc., of Fort Vermilion,\r\ngave some detailed and interesting evidence. Mr. Lawrence explained that\r\nhis father went out to Peace river from Montreal in 1879, in the employ\r\nof the Church of England missions, becoming at once interested in the\r\nproblem of making the missions and Indian schools in Peace river, and\r\nthe whole of the northern country, self-sustaining. The settlement of\r\nFort Vermilion is in latitude 58·30°, almost as far north as the\r\nnorthern part of Labrador. The place in 1907 (it has since increased\r\nconsiderably) consisted of about five hundred people, white people, and\r\nEnglish-speaking half-breeds. The total production of wheat there in\r\n1906 would be twenty-five thousand bushels, the average being\r\n\r\n                 ABOUT TWENTY-ONE BUSHELS TO THE ACRE.\r\n\r\nOf oats and barley about ten thousand bushels, mostly barley, was\r\nraised. The wheat was ground and used to make bread for the people out\r\nthere. The first market was at Fort Vermilion and the surrounding\r\npoints, and whatever surplus there was was shipped down Peace river into\r\nMackenzie river district.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sheridan Lawrence’s Farm at Fort Vermilion.]\r\n\r\nMr. Lawrence stated that in 1906 he had cut spring wheat, fully matured,\r\nin eighty-six days. The time of cutting was the end of July. Wheat grown\r\nat Fort Vermilion is harder than grain of the same variety grown in\r\nOntario. He explained that the river bottom proper only consists of\r\npoints or flats in the bottom of the bed of the river, which “bottom” is\r\npractically about two miles in width, whereas, what is properly called\r\nPeace river valley, is in reality a broad tract of country. When you\r\nonce get on to the height of land, this so-called “valley” covers three\r\nhundred miles in width, and extends from Rocky mountains on to Lake\r\nAthabaska. Peace river makes great bends, and on alternate sides of the\r\nriver you find wide flats, where there is probably the richest soil\r\nthere is in that northern country, made up of alluvial deposits all of\r\nblack soil. There are places on the lower part of these points which get\r\nflooded, perhaps once in seven or eight years. Nearly all the points,\r\nhowever, are above the high water mark, and when these flats are\r\ncultivated the soil yields the heaviest of crops. On these flats\r\ncultivation of the soil was first undertaken in that part of the\r\ncountry, and it was supposed by many that they comprised the only part\r\nof Peace river country that was suitable for cultivation. People\r\nsupposed that when they undertook the cultivation of grain on the height\r\nof land they would get into the muskeg and swamp that adjoined the river\r\nin many places, and grain could not be raised; but this has been proved\r\nto be a fallacy. The tableland is sometimes called “bench land,” and\r\nthis bench land in some places is very wide. There are places in it, as\r\nat the south of Fort Vermilion, and to the north and west, where there\r\nis one hundred miles of this land on each side of the river.\r\n\r\nThis land is not all suitable for cultivation. It has its swamps and its\r\nmuskeg, and its\r\n\r\n                          LOW PATCHES OF LAND,\r\n\r\nthat are found in almost any country where there is a large growth of\r\nscrub timber; but the larger part of this land, as Mr. Lawrence had\r\nfound by travelling over the country away from the river, is suitable\r\nfor settlement.\r\n\r\nMr. Lawrence drew the attention of the committee to the fact that some\r\nyears ago, Doctor Dawson, after going through Peace river country,\r\nreported that a large part of it was covered with muskeg and would be\r\npermanently unsuited for agriculture. In 1903 he took a trip from Fort\r\nVermilion through Lesser Slave lake, through an unknown country two\r\nhundred and fifty miles. Later than that he travelled away from Peace\r\nriver about fifty or sixty miles, and saw something that gave him an\r\nidea of these muskegs. The muskegs had covered some large patches of\r\nthat country, and the moss was about three feet in thickness. There had\r\nbeen large tracts of this moss burnt out. Forest fires had been running\r\nthrough there, and Mr. Lawrence supposed that the fire burnt thousands\r\nof acres that had formerly been muskeg, as shown by these large patches\r\nof moss, sometimes a few feet across and sometimes larger, which were\r\nleft standing, where the muskeg had been. On this burnt area he saw\r\ngrass from four to five feet in height. There were thousands of acres of\r\nit covered with the red-top grass, which is the standard grass of the\r\nwest. The reason these muskegs had been there for so many years was that\r\nthe moss formed a great sponge and retained the moisture. But when all\r\nthat land is drained and the moss removed, it will certainly raise good\r\ncrops of grass, and where grass can be grown, grain can be raised.\r\n\r\nMr. Lawrence stated that he would say that about one-tenth of the\r\ndistrict to the north is covered with moss. To the south of Grande\r\nprairie there is a large proportion covered with moss, and Doctor Dawson\r\nmay have intended to refer particularly to that district. Mr. Lawrence\r\nproduced photographs of the grain raised on the soil that was formerly\r\ncovered by timber—low land and timber. He explained that he had farmed\r\nat Vermilion for over twenty years, and had\r\n\r\n                      NEVER HAD A FAILURE IN WHEAT\r\n\r\nduring that time, although he had as low as five and one-half bushels to\r\nthe acre. There was one very dry season which reduced the average, but\r\nthere was always a certain amount of grain raised there that was good\r\nfor seed and grinding purposes. There has never been a complete failure\r\nfrom frost or any other cause. They have no rust on the wheat up there.\r\nHe had raised as much as sixty-six bushels of wheat to the acre. That\r\nwas the biggest yield, and accomplished without any fertilizer whatever.\r\nThe heads of wheat at Fort Vermilion often would grow to the length of\r\nsix inches, and at times he had counted sixty-five kernels in one head\r\nof wheat. Barley sown after the middle of May is usually ripe in the\r\nlast week of July. The continuous daylight with about eighteen hours of\r\nsunlight accounts for the rapid growth of all vegetables in these parts.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of July, Mr. Lawrence stated, they have at Fort\r\nVermilion an occasional frost that sometimes cuts the potato vines down,\r\nbut never puts them back seriously—just enough to show the effect of\r\nthe frost on some of the top leaves. The potato vines, however, often\r\nshow no sign of frost until they are ripe, and the potatoes obtain their\r\nfull size and are matured. They had never had July frost severe enough\r\nto ruin the potato crops. These frosts are very slight. In 1906 he\r\nplanted his garden during the week following May 24, and he planted\r\ntomatoes, cucumbers, peas and other vegetables. In the fall, during\r\nharvesting, his family had squash pie that was made from squash ripened\r\nin their own garden. The squash were raised just the same as the peas\r\nand other vegetables and took their chances, no hotbed and no special\r\ncare, and he also raised cucumbers and tomatoes. The tomatoes did not\r\nripen, but before they had a chance to freeze they were taken up. He\r\nthought that with care such as is given to these things in Manitoba and\r\nother parts of the Northwest, planting these tender vegetables early in\r\nhotbeds, and giving them care, the same success could be had in raising\r\ntomatoes, squash or other things of that kind as is had in Manitoba and\r\nother districts. At Peace River Landing tomatoes were ripened in 1906 in\r\nthe open garden. Other garden vegetables, such as cabbages, and so on,\r\ngrow very well. He had raised cabbages at Fort Vermilion eighteen and\r\none-half pounds in weight, and swede turnips are raised in the open\r\nfield. Out of a three-acre patch\r\n\r\n                        HE HAD SELECTED TURNIPS,\r\n\r\nand a great many of them weighed from eighteen to twenty-five pounds.\r\nThey were of the purple-top variety. They had no special attention or\r\ncare, and they were good sound turnips.\r\n\r\nAnother of the witnesses examined before the same committee of the\r\nSenate was Mr. W. F. Bredin, member of the Alberta legislative assembly\r\nfor the district. Mr. Bredin, in his evidence, stated that as regards\r\nPeace river valley, he would judge that from the mountains to Peace\r\npoint, a distance of between seven and eight hundred miles, following\r\nthe winding of the river, there is an average of seventy-five miles in\r\nwidth on each side of Peace river that is equal to the soil on any\r\nsimilar length of the Saskatchewan. That would make Peace river country\r\nabout one hundred and fifty miles in width, and extending from the\r\nmountains to Peace point, a distance of seven or eight hundred miles,\r\nwhich is all equally good for agricultural purposes with the\r\nSaskatchewan valley. That would extend considerably beyond the bottom\r\nlands of the river, including also the table land back of the river. A\r\ngreat deal of it is clean prairie, on the north especially. There is\r\nmore of it covered with scrub and small timber than there is clean\r\nprairie, but the soil is equally good where the timber grows. Mr. Bredin\r\nstated that he had a ranch at Grande prairie for six years, and raised\r\noats and vegetables every year there. He had cattle there for five\r\nwinters, and the average length of feeding them during those five years\r\nwas six weeks of each winter. That is south of Peace river, but within\r\nthis belt of one hundred and fifty miles. In that Spirit river country\r\nhe knew there were some white settlers, as well as half-breeds, who were\r\nmaking their living by\r\n\r\n                       RAISING STOCK AND FARMING.\r\n\r\nThat seven hundred or eight hundred miles of good country, of which he\r\nspoke, would extend right to the foot of the Rockies. As to the question\r\nof the uniformity of the quality of the soil, he had only been down to\r\nwhat they call Wolverine point, near Fort Vermilion. He would say the\r\ncountry is uniformly good from Rocky mountains to that point. At\r\nWolverine point the valley is much lower and perhaps the soil may be\r\nblacker, and the black soil may be deeper on the lower stretches of the\r\nPeace. All of that country would be good for stock. Both slough and\r\nupland hay is abundant. The pea vine and all the small fruits that grow\r\nanywhere else in the northwest grow up there, and all the wild flowers\r\nthat he knew of in the northwest grow there. This area in Peace river\r\ncountry would compare on the whole with any part of Canada.\r\n\r\nIn reply to a question, Mr. Bredin stated that after his ten years’\r\nexperience of the country north of Edmonton he would consider that to be\r\nquite as good a place for a man to settle in as the Saskatchewan valley\r\nwas twenty-five years previously. During the debate on the capital\r\nquestion in the Alberta legislative assembly at Edmonton, Mr. Bredin\r\nremarked, he had made an estimate of the good land north of Edmonton in\r\nAlberta, and it figured up more than the good land south of that city.\r\nIf you were to add all the good land north of the Alberta boundary to\r\nAlberta, you would have about twice as much good land in the province\r\nnorth of Edmonton as there is south of that city.\r\n\r\n                ONE HUNDRED MILLION ACRES OF GOOD LAND.\r\n\r\nMr. Bredin submitted what he said he considered a careful estimate of\r\nall the good land north of Edmonton, east of Rocky mountains. He\r\nstated:—“My estimate of the area of the agricultural lands that will be\r\navailable in northern Alberta—say north of the 55th parallel of\r\nlatitude—and in the unorganized district of Mackenzie, is not less than\r\none hundred millions of acres.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bredin informed the committee that one spring, when he left Fort St.\r\nJohn on the upper Peace, the grain there was up six or seven inches. He\r\nmust have been at least a month going to Edmonton, and when he got there\r\nthe grain there was just in the same stage of growth as the grain had\r\nbeen when he left Fort St. John; so the season must be earlier at the\r\nlatter place. They very often sowed seed at Fort St. John in March, and\r\ninvariably no later than April. In 1906 they began cutting the wheat at\r\nPeace River Landing on the last day of July, and the wheat was ready to\r\ncut five or six days earlier than that. As a matter of fact, Mr. Brick,\r\nthe member for Peace river district in the Alberta legislature, started\r\nto cut on the last day of July, and he told Mr. Bredin that the grain\r\nwas ready to cut a week earlier. Mr. Brick cultivated there, that year,\r\nthree hundred acres of land in wheat, oats and barley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vegetable Garden 15 miles west of Fort St. John.]\r\n\r\nStockmen west of Peace River Landing would have to feed their cattle,\r\ntaking one year with another, an average of seven weeks, and east of\r\nthat probably more.\r\n\r\nMr. Elihu Stewart, of the city of Ottawa, at the time Superintendent of\r\nForestry for the Dominion Government, since retired from the public\r\nservice to engage in private business, was one of the most important\r\nwitnesses examined before the committee. He explained that his knowledge\r\nof the country beyond the Saskatchewan has principally been derived from\r\ntwo trips that he made, one in 1902 to Peace river, and one during the\r\nseason of 1906 down the Athabaska, down Slave river, and down the\r\nMackenzie to the delta, and thence across to the Yukon, and back by the\r\nway of Dawson. Mr. Stewart produced before the committee samples of some\r\nof the grains that are grown at the end of Lesser Slave lake. One was a\r\nsample of hulled barley, grown for the use of the mission schools;\r\nanother, wheat from Lesser Slave lake; a third, another quality of wheat\r\nfrom the Roman Catholic mission at the end of Lesser Slave lake, grown\r\nthat year (1902). These exhibits were principally from the farm at the\r\nend of Lesser Slave lake. The Roman Catholic mission there has\r\n\r\n                      A VERY LARGE FARM AND STOCK,\r\n\r\nand grain is grown there by others as well. Mr. Stewart said he had\r\nnoticed in discussions on Peace river that there was not enough\r\ndistinction made between the valley of Peace river and the tableland\r\nabove. There is a high level country, and all at once it drops down some\r\nsix hundred feet to a valley. He thought the difference between the\r\nheight of the banks and the water at Peace River Landing is something\r\nlike six hundred feet. In that valley there is no question at all about\r\nthe wheat ripening. He produced some specimens of grain grown in the\r\nvalley near Peace River Landing, also some tobacco grown there. The\r\nwidth of Peace river valley is very narrow, not over two miles at the\r\ncrossing. The soil is good, perhaps a little heavy, with the exception\r\nof a few miles which is light and covered with jackpine. The rest is\r\ngood agricultural land. There would not be a great quantity of it in the\r\nvalley of the river at that part. The altitude is pretty high, but down\r\nthe river towards Fort Vermilion it lowers, and probably the elevation\r\nof the upland there would not be greater than the level of the water at\r\nPeace River Landing. The grain-growing capabilities of that plateau all\r\ndepend on the elevation. Peace river district is an immense country\r\nextending some six hundred miles from the mountains to the lake. Down at\r\nFort Vermilion crossing they raise large quantities of wheat. Of course,\r\nat a very high altitude the same result cannot be expected, but wheat he\r\nsaw on the plateau above Peace river was uninjured on September 20. But\r\nthere was frost that night. He did not know whether it was enough to\r\nkill the grain. However, if they had no frost up to September 20, there\r\nshould be\r\n\r\n                    NO TROUBLE RIPENING GRAIN THERE,\r\n\r\nbecause it ought to be fit for harvesting before the end of August. The\r\nwheat in question was sown by an Indian and put in very late. Wheat\r\ngrown at Fort Vermilion took the first prize as the best wheat shown at\r\nthe Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia, in 1876.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry A. Conroy, Inspector for the Indian Department under Treaty\r\nNo. 8, gave some very interesting evidence as to the agricultural\r\nresources of Peace river country before the committee. Mr. Conroy stated\r\nthat he had been annually travelling through this northern country for\r\nabout eight or nine years. He starts in along Athabaska river, from\r\nAthabaska, which is about one hundred miles from Edmonton and goes up\r\nthe river to the junction of Little Slave river, thence visiting all the\r\nIndian reserves in the treaty district.\r\n\r\nWhen Peace river district is reached via the route taken by Mr. Conroy,\r\nthe altitude is very high. It is certainly over one thousand feet from\r\nthe top of the bank down to the bottom of the river—tremendous banks.\r\nThe country, as he understood it, is very fine. Bunch grass grows all\r\nalong the north side extending through to Hay river. He had information\r\nas to this country from Indians and half-breeds, and they say bunch\r\ngrass grows all along the way. Shortly after striking the Peace,\r\nDunvegan is reached. The country north of Dunvegan; all along the river\r\nis, in the opinion of Mr. Conroy, fit for agriculture on both sides and\r\nfor any distance back. Of course one would have to go up to the top of\r\nthe banks to get the land. Fine buffalo grass grows in the district\r\nnorth of Dunvegan up to Peace River Landing. As to the country running\r\nacross from Dunvegan to Fort St. John, it would not take a man very long\r\nto cross it if he had a road.\r\n\r\n                        A STARTLING COMPARISON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View of the Pouce Coupé Prairie.]\r\n\r\nMr. Conroy stated emphatically that he was of opinion there is a large\r\narea of valuable agricultural land on Peace river. Taking the whole\r\ncountry there as far as he knew, there is as much agricultural land to\r\nbe settled as there is settled at present west of Winnipeg.\r\n\r\nMr. Conroy uttered a word of warning against some of the settlers\r\n(old-timers). He remarked:—“Old-timers in there do not want anybody to\r\ncome in, and they tell people the country is no good. They have the\r\nwhole country to themselves. One man grows two thousand or three\r\nthousand bushels of wheat every year and gets for it from one dollar to\r\none dollar and seventy-five cents a bushel from the Hudson’s Bay\r\nCompany, and he does not want anybody else to come in and compete with\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nContinuing his evidence, Mr. Conroy explained that from Fort Vermilion\r\nnortheasterly the limit of the agricultural country is reached, but\r\nbelow that it could be made an agricultural country. There were no\r\nsettlers there at all then (1907). At Fort Vermilion there had been a\r\nsettlement for many years. Mr. Conroy said he had been there many times,\r\nand knew all the settlers in that section. Some of the finest wheat he\r\never saw, he saw growing in that settlement. He saw it only after it was\r\nharvested; it was threshed. They had a roller mill there, an up-to-date\r\nmill. The Hudson’s Bay Company manufactured flour at Fort Vermilion to\r\nsend north.\r\n\r\nWhile at Peace River Landing with the Indian Treaty Expedition in 1899,\r\nMr. Charles Mair (“Through the Mackenzie Basin,” p. 89) made enquiries\r\nas to the fertile areas of the upper Peace from the Indians, half-breed\r\nhunters, and the few prosperous farmers and stockmen of the district.\r\nThe nearest farmer and rancher to Dunvegan, at that date, Mr. C.\r\nBrymner, who had lived for ten years on Spirit river, told Mr. Mair that\r\nduring seven of these, though frost had touched his grain, particularly\r\nin June, it had done little serious harm. Mr. Brymner informed Mr. Mair\r\nthat it was a fine hay country, even the ridge hay being good. Mr.\r\nBrymner, himself, had at the time over a hundred head of cattle, which,\r\nthanks to the Chinook winds, fed out late in the autumn and early in the\r\nspring. Mr. Mair states that southeast of Fort St. John there is a\r\nconsiderable area known as Pouce Coupé prairie, which was well spoken\r\nof. The “Grande prairie,” to the southwest of Peace River Landing, which\r\nconnects with Spirit river country and is drained by Smoky river and its\r\nbranches, is a much more extensive open country. This is an extensive\r\ndistrict suitable for immediate cultivation, and containing valuable\r\ntimber for lumber, fencing and building.\r\n\r\nMr. Mair states that Rev. Father Busson told him in 1899 that at the\r\nDunvegan and St. Augustine mission farms White Russian and Red Fife\r\nwheat had been raised since 1881, and during all these years it had\r\nnever been seriously injured whilst the yield had reached as high as\r\nthirty-five bushels to the acre. Seeding began about the middle of April\r\nand harvesting about the middle of August.\r\n\r\n                   PRESENT CONDITIONS AND SETTLEMENT.\r\n\r\nIn his annual report (see annual report Royal Northwest Mounted Police,\r\n1908), dated Athabaska, October 8, 1909, Inspector D. M. Howard of “N”\r\nDivision of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police gives much interesting\r\ninformation regarding conditions at that recent date in Peace river\r\nregion. It will be observed that some of the Inspector’s references are\r\nto districts immediately north and east of that directly under review in\r\nthis chapter, but they are none the less instructive here on account of\r\nthe similarity of climate and other conditions.\r\n\r\nThose portions of the report referring directly to the districts treated\r\nof in this volume are extremely interesting. The principal settlements\r\nin the district at that date were stated to be as follows:—\r\n\r\n“Lesser Slave lake, known as Grouard, so called after the Roman Catholic\r\nbishop of the diocese, a well known pioneer of the country, is situated\r\nsix miles from the west end of Lesser Slave lake and has a population of\r\ntwenty-five whites, and one hundred and twenty-five half-breeds, who\r\nmake their living by hunting, fishing, and freighting in the winter\r\ntime. Most of them have a few head of cattle and horses, and small\r\ngardens where they raise vegetables for their own use. The Roman\r\nCatholic mission has a school, hospital and convent. The Church of\r\nEngland also has a mission school for the Indian and half-breed\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n“Salt Prairie and Heart River (settlement) has a population of twenty\r\nwhites and one hundred and seventy-five half-breeds.\r\n\r\n“Prairie River (settlement) is considered one of the best settlements in\r\nthe district, the land being very good. It has a population of\r\neighty-five whites (Canadians, Americans and Swedes) and twenty-three\r\nhalf-breeds.\r\n\r\n“Sturgeon Lake (settlement) has a population of nine whites and two\r\nhundred and ninety half-breeds and Indians.\r\n\r\n“In Peace River Landing district there are six actual\r\nsettlements:—Peace River Landing, Shaftesbury, Silver Springs, Cold\r\nSprings, Bear Lake and Little Prairie.”\r\n\r\nThe inspector proceeds to give some particulars about these pioneer\r\nsettlements.\r\n\r\nSilver Springs (settlement) is situated about five miles from the farm\r\nof T. A. Brick, on a high bench at the head of a spring named by the\r\nsettlers, Silver Springs.\r\n\r\nBear Lake (settlement) is used only as a winter camp, and for haying in\r\nthe summer. The lake from which it is named is about twelve miles long\r\nby eight wide. It is very shallow and muddy, although the land about it\r\nis very good and will make a good grain country, but as yet no one has\r\ndone anything in that line. There are no fish in this lake.\r\n\r\nLittle Prairie (settlement) is about twenty-two miles out from Peace\r\nRiver Landing on the way to Lesser Slave lake. This prairie is about ten\r\nmiles long and one wide, but can be extended in all directions by\r\nclearing the bush. The land is very good, and the little grain sown has\r\ndone very well this year. Two white men and a number of half-breeds are\r\nthe only settlers at present.\r\n\r\nPeace River Landing (settlement) is what is known as round the crossing\r\nof Peace river, extending about ten miles up on the north side of the\r\nriver, taking in the Roman Catholic mission, known as Smoky River\r\nmission on account of its being opposite Smoky river where it joins the\r\nPeace; this part is all surveyed with free grant lots to both whites and\r\nhalf-breeds who had settled there before the treaty known as No. 8 was\r\nmade with the Indians.\r\n\r\nShaftesbury is the name given to the upper part of Peace River Landing\r\nsettlement, round the English Church mission, extending some sixteen\r\nmiles up the river, and comprising the balance of Peace River Landing\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\n                   THE POST OFFICE FOR THIS DISTRICT\r\n\r\nis situated at Peace River Landing, and serves for all these\r\nsettlements.\r\n\r\nCold Springs (settlement) is located on high land about thirty miles\r\nfrom Peace River Landing, near Old Wives Lake Indian reserve; several\r\nsettlers have taken up land there this year, and grain of all kinds has\r\ndone well.\r\n\r\nPeace River Landing settlement, including Shaftesbury, Bear Lake and\r\nSilver Springs settlements, has a population of about two hundred and\r\nforty; twenty-nine French-Canadians, thirty Canadians and English, forty\r\nIndians and one hundred and fifty half-breeds. Little Heart River has a\r\npopulation of forty half-breeds and two whites (Americans).\r\n\r\nAs to industries and transportation, Inspector Howard stated in his\r\nreport:—“Steam sawmills are in operation at the following points in the\r\ndistrict:—Athabaska, Lesser Slave lake, Peace River Landing, Prairie\r\nRiver, Fort Vermilion, Chipewyan and Fort Smith; one is also to be in\r\noperation at Saskatoon lake in the Grande prairie country this winter.\r\nThe mill at this point does a good business, as a number of new houses\r\nhave gone up in the village this year, and a considerable quantity of\r\nlumber is used annually in the building of the scows for the river\r\ntransport; few of these scows are brought back up the river, but are\r\nbroken up down below, and the lumber used for building purposes, scows\r\nbeing built new at this point every year. Grist mills are also in\r\noperation at Lesser Slave lake, Peace River Landing and Fort Vermilion.\r\nAt Sawridge two lime kilns are in operation and a good quality of lime\r\ncan be obtained at a reasonable price.\r\n\r\n“The Northern Transportation Company has built a new steamer at this\r\npoint (Athabaska) this summer for use on the run between here and Moose\r\nportage. This steamer is smaller than the ‘Northland Sun’ and of lighter\r\ndraught and will enable the company to run much later than in former\r\nyears. The river gets very low in the autumn before the freeze-up.\r\n\r\n“Until the country has a railway affording the settlers entrance to the\r\nmarkets, the grain acreage will not increase beyond sufficient to supply\r\nthe settlers’ own wants, and to meet local demands, but the advent of a\r\nrailway will change all this.”[16]\r\n\r\n                        PRESENT DAY AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\nInspector Howard gave the following information as to agriculture in his\r\ndistrict:—\r\n\r\n“The general state of the district is satisfactory, and most of the\r\nsettlers, having had good crops, seem well pleased with their prospects\r\nin this new country. In some parts of Peace river country a few suffered\r\nloss from hail, and want of rain in other parts has affected the crops\r\nof a few injuriously, but on the whole the crops were a very fair\r\naverage. In most cases threshing is not over, but in one case where the\r\ncrop has been threshed a Mr. L. H. Adair, of Baptiste lake, about twelve\r\nmiles west of Athabaska, really in the Athabaska country, threshed five\r\nthousand bushels of oats from one hundred and twenty acres of land.\r\nNearly all the new settlers coming into the country this year have\r\nsettled at Grande prairie, in Peace river country, where the land is\r\nvery good. Most of these settlers were from Eastern Canada and the\r\nUnited States, and in nearly all cases were supplied with a fair amount\r\nof capital, stock and farm implements. Nearly all of them have put in\r\ngardens, and have vegetables enough for their use in the winter, and\r\nfrom reports I have received from the detachments, in no cases should\r\nthere be any shortage amongst the new settlers during the coming winter.\r\n\r\n“Mixed farming is chiefly carried on in this district, oats and barley\r\nbeing the chief grain grown. There is practically no market for wheat at\r\npresent owing to the want of railway communication. Potatoes and all\r\nother kinds of vegetables are successfully grown, most of the farmers\r\nhaving small vegetable gardens for their own consumption, but\r\npractically none are grown for market.\r\n\r\n“In Peace River district, Red Fife wheat was sown last spring from seed\r\nsupplied by the government. The wheat principally sown in this district\r\nin former years was Ladoga, an early ripening grain, but the Red Fife\r\nappears to have done just as well this year. The amount of grain raised\r\nthis year in Peace River Landing district is about:—Wheat, five\r\nthousand bushels; oats, four thousand bushels; barley, one thousand two\r\nhundred bushels. Threshing was not finished at the time this report was\r\nmade, so the above is only an estimate.\r\n\r\n“There are about three hundred head of horses of all kinds and three\r\nhundred and fifty head of cattle owned by settlers in Peace River\r\nsettlement, practically\r\n\r\n                     EVERY FARMER OWNING A FEW HEAD\r\n\r\nof each. In Lesser Slave lake district there are approximately six\r\nhundred and one horses, seven hundred and fourteen cattle and one\r\nhundred and forty-five pigs; in addition to these there are the\r\nfollowing registered stock: three stallions, five bulls, thirteen cows,\r\nfour boars and six sows.\r\n\r\n“The crops through Peace River Landing and Lesser Slave lake\r\nsubdistricts have been a fair average. The grazing lands about Lesser\r\nSlave lake, Grande prairie, Peace River Landing, Fort Vermilion and\r\nother sections are very good, and hay is very plentiful and a supply for\r\nthe winter can easily be put up.\r\n\r\n“The acreage under crop in Lesser Slave lake sub-district is about seven\r\nhundred and thirteen acres of oats, three hundred and one acres of\r\nbarley, twenty-three acres of spring wheat, nineteen acres of fall\r\nwheat, twelve acres of fall rye. One acre of sugar beets and mangolds\r\nwere grown this year as an experiment and turned out very successfully.\r\n\r\n“The crop all round was good; only one farmer suffered any loss, about\r\ntwelve acres of his barley being damaged by hail.\r\n\r\n“Next year there will be a much increased acreage under crop, a lot of\r\nbreaking having been done this summer and autumn.”\r\n\r\n                     A PLEASANT COUNTRY TO LIVE IN.\r\n\r\nNot only does the climate of the Peace country appear to be satisfactory\r\nfrom the view point of the farmer, but it is also described by\r\ntravellers as exceptionally pleasant to live in. Mr. Warburton Pike, in\r\nhis book (See p. 19) refers enthusiastically to the beautiful autumn of\r\nthe Peace country. He writes:—“We reached Fort Vermilion late in\r\nSeptember, in the full glory of the autumn; the sharp morning frosts had\r\ncoloured the poplar leaves with the brightest golden tints, and the blue\r\nhaze of an Indian summer hung over prairie and wood. Away on Great Slave\r\nlake a half-breed had told me of the beauties of Fort Vermilion as a\r\nfarming country, and had explained that all the good things of the world\r\ngrew there freely, so that I was prepared for the sight of wheat and\r\nbarley fields, which had this year produced a more abundant harvest than\r\nusual; potatoes and other vegetables were growing luxuriously; cattle\r\nand horses were fattening on the rich prairie grass, and it seemed that\r\nthere was little to be gained by leaving such a fertile spot in the face\r\nof the winter that would soon be upon us.”\r\n\r\nSpeaking of his trip up the upper Peace between the date mentioned and\r\nthe end of November, Mr. Pike wrote:—“I do not remember to have ever\r\nseen in any other part of Canada such a fine autumn as we enjoyed\r\nbetween Vermilion and the Rockies. There was hardly a day’s rain the\r\nwhole time, and, although a sharp white frost usually made a cold camp,\r\nthe days were bright and at times almost too hot for tracking.”\r\n\r\nThat the climate of Peace river country is exceptionally healthy is\r\ndeclared by all the white people who have lived there, and their\r\ndeclaration appears to be borne out by the fact that a considerable\r\nportion of the inhabitants have attained a very old age. Mr. Charles\r\nMair in his book “Through the Mackenzie Basin” mentions that when the\r\nIndian Treaty expedition was at Lesser Slave lake in 1899 his attention\r\nwas drawn to the number of people of extreme old age among the\r\ninhabitants. He especially mentioned the case of an aged half-breed\r\nwoman, Catherine Bisson, who was born on New Year’s day in the year\r\n1793. She was blind at the time Mr. Mair saw her, and scarcely able to\r\nwalk, but was able to talk, and even cracked jokes with those about her.\r\nIn a footnote Mr. Mair states that this very old woman died in the\r\nspring of 1908 at the remarkable age of one hundred and fifteen years.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[15] It will be observed that this paragraph and other portions of this\r\ntestimony really refer to the Athabaska country treated of in the\r\npreceding chapter, but to save an awkward dislocation of Professor\r\nMacoun’s testimony it has been kept intact. (E. J. C.)\r\n\r\n[16] The railway is now being constructed, and there has been a\r\nremarkable development in this section since Inspector Howard penned\r\nthis report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NORTHERN ALBERTA.\r\n\r\n                   Tree Growth and Timber Resources.\r\n\r\n   An Abundance of Timber in the Vicinity of Chipewyan.—Much of the\r\n     Country Has Been Swept by Fires.—Most of the Timber is Along\r\n     the Rivers.—Millions of Cords of Pulp Wood.—Spruce and Black\r\n     Bark Poplar the Principal Varieties.—The Water Power\r\n     Possibilities Described as Tremendous.\r\n\r\nThe timber resources of northern Alberta, according to the evidence in\r\nhand, are very considerable, a matter of not a little importance in a\r\nnew country. We will deal first with the eastern, or Athabaska division\r\nof this section.\r\n\r\nIn his evidence before the Senate committee of 1888, Professor John\r\nMacoun, Botanist to the Geological Survey, said:—“There is an abundance\r\nof timber in the vicinity of Chipewyan on Lake Athabaska. There are as\r\nfine spruce in the Athabaska delta as are to be found in any part of the\r\nnorthwest. I have measured trees on the Embarass river that were two\r\nfeet and a half in diameter and were very tall. On Peace river,\r\nlikewise, especially on islands, there are many large groves of spruce\r\nand poplar, which attain extraordinary dimensions.”\r\n\r\nMr. Alfred von Hamerstein informed the Senate committee in 1907 that\r\nfrom McMurray up in a westerly direction, for about twenty miles, there\r\nis very good timber. He had seen trees that would make one thousand feet\r\nof lumber. From Athabaska to House river there is timber standing yet.\r\nThere had been some fires raging, but they had not burned it yet. The\r\ntimber consists of some patches of spruce of a fairly good size, and the\r\nrest is poplar. From House river to McMurray there is no timber left. It\r\nis all burned out. There are patches here and there along the river, a\r\ncouple of trees left standing, and there is some very fine timber in\r\nthat. There is some timber which Mr. von Hamerstein used for his oil\r\nwell boring work, and he had taken out strips sixty-four feet long, out\r\nof which he had cut his walking beams. There are only patches of this\r\ntimber; the rest had been burned. A little further east there is some\r\nfine timber at Chipewyan. From the mouth of Peace river to about Fort\r\nVermilion there is some good timber. Timber of the same quality ranges\r\nnorth for a considerable distance. There will be a range of timber four\r\nor five miles long, and then muskeg. From the Vermilion down there is no\r\ntimber left; it is all burned up. There is no young timber growing up to\r\nspeak of—at least Mr. von Hamerstein did not see any, except in a few\r\nplaces where a little young timber is starting to grow. Indeed it is\r\nmostly poplar, with patches here and there of spruce, but mostly poplar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Saw Mill near Fort Smith.]\r\n\r\nMr. H. A. Conroy of the Indian Department, in his evidence before the\r\nSenate committee of 1907, stated that he had been east of Lake Athabaska\r\nas far as Fort à la Corne. All along the rivers there is good timber,\r\nparticularly on Great Slave river. On the lower levels of the Athabaska,\r\nthrough to Athabaska lake, there is heavy timber all the way along. Mr.\r\nConroy did not know what was behind the timber belt, but believed it was\r\npretty muskeggy. That was what the Indians told him. He had been up the\r\nriver by boat every year for eight years. Taking the country as a whole,\r\nthere is quite\r\n\r\n                      A LOT OF MARKETABLE TIMBER.\r\n\r\nAll the rivers and lakes could produce good timber. There are millions\r\nof cords of spruce for pulpwood.\r\n\r\nMr. Conroy, in a report to the Superintendent of Forestry, January 17,\r\n1910, wrote:—“That part of Athabaska river north from McMurray to Smith\r\nlanding is fringed with a heavy growth of spruce and black bark poplar.\r\nThe spruce is quite large, and from an economical standpoint will be of\r\ngreat value in the future. A considerable part of this country is also\r\nexcellent for agricultural purposes. From McMurray southwest to\r\nAthabaska there is quite a quantity of valuable spruce and poplar which\r\nhas been saved by the watchfulness of the guardian, William Biggs, who\r\nmakes his trips up and down that section of the river. He is one of the\r\nmost useful men in the north.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1910 Mr. W. Hayes, a capitalist and manufacturer of\r\nDuluth, Minnesota, made an exploratory trip through the Athabaska\r\ncountry with A. Violette. Mr. Hayes stated in an interview on his return\r\nto Edmonton that there was timber enough in Athabaska district to supply\r\nwestern Canada for the next half century. Agricultural prospects, he\r\ndeclared, could not be better, while copper, iron and gold had been\r\nfound, and also petroleum, asphalt, limestone and oil. Fishing could be\r\ndeveloped into quite an industry.\r\n\r\nInterviewed in Edmonton after his long trip in 1910 (See p. 27) the Hon.\r\nFrank Oliver, Minister of the Interior, stated:—“All the way from\r\nEdmonton to Fort Macpherson the country, along the rivers at least, is\r\nlevel and forested. There is no prairie. On the upper part of Athabaska\r\nriver the banks are from one hundred to two hundred feet in length, and\r\nthe country is well wooded. There is a considerable amount of spruce of\r\ngood size, but the timber is chiefly poplar. The country has at one time\r\nbeen altogether under spruce, but fires have wrought havoc in it. The\r\nexplanation of these fires is that all freight for the north country\r\ngoes down Athabaska river and the men who steer the scows down walk back\r\nalong the banks. They are careless with their camp fires and the result\r\nis a continual danger of further destruction by fire.”\r\n\r\n                         VALUABLE WATER POWERS.\r\n\r\nWith such knowledge as we now possess it is safe to say that within a\r\nfew years the water powers of the section of country under review will\r\nconstitute one of its most important natural assets.\r\n\r\nMr. William Ogilvie, in a letter published in the Ottawa Journal,\r\nFebruary 19, 1910, writing of the water power susceptible of development\r\non Slave river, stated:—“When making my survey in 1888, I deduced the\r\ntotal fall in the river in this stretch by observing the angles of\r\ndepression or elevation of each survey station from the preceding one,\r\nand with the distance from each station to station deducing the rise and\r\nfall; in this way I found the total fall to be two hundred and\r\nforty-seven feet. The instrument I had to use was not of a high order of\r\nprecision for this purpose; nevertheless, I feel safe in saying the fall\r\nis between two hundred and thirty and two hundred and sixty feet. All\r\nthe drainage basins of Peace and Athabaska rivers, and Lake Athabaska,\r\nare in one here, and with this fall in so short a distance the power\r\npossibilities, when required, will be tremendous.”\r\n\r\nMr. Ogilvie, upon another occasion, speaking of Athabaska river,\r\nsaid:—“The current averages well over four miles an hour, but the rate\r\nvaries much with the height of water. At Grand rapids falls, the fall is\r\nabout sixty feet in one quarter of a mile. They are a fine sight and\r\nwill, when required, develop a lot of power; I would say in the average\r\nseason fully as much as Chaudiere falls at Ottawa (say eighty thousand\r\nhorse-power).”\r\n\r\n                          PEACE RIVER SECTION.\r\n\r\nAs to the timber resources of the western or Peace river division of the\r\nsection under review, Doctor G. M. Dawson, before the Senate committee\r\nof 1888, after describing the prairie country, showed that the remainder\r\nof the surface was generally occupied by second-growth forest,\r\noccasionally dense, but more often composed of aspen, birch and\r\ncottonwood, with a greater or less proportion of coniferous trees. Some\r\npatches of the original forest, he said, remained, however, particularly\r\nin the river valleys, and were composed of much larger trees, chiefly\r\nconiferous, among which the spruce was most abundant. Handsome groves of\r\nold and large cottonwoods were also to be found in some of the valleys.\r\nWhere the soil became locally sandy and poor, and more particularly in\r\nsome of the more elevated parts of the high ridges above described, a\r\nthick growth of scrub pine and spruce, in which the individual trees\r\nwere small, was found, and in swamp regions the tamarack was not\r\nwanting, and grew generally intermixed with the spruce.\r\n\r\nEast of Smoky river, and southward toward the Athabaska, the prairie\r\ncountry was quite insignificant in extent, the region being\r\ncharacterized by second growth forest, which was only beginning to\r\nstruggle up.\r\n\r\nWhatever theory be adopted, and may have been advanced to account for\r\nthe wide prairies of the western portions of America further to the\r\nsouth, the origin of the prairies of Peace river was sufficiently\r\nobvious, Doctor Dawson thought. There could be no doubt that they had\r\nbeen produced and were maintained by fires. The country was naturally a\r\nwooded one, and where fires had not run for a few years, young trees\r\nbegan rapidly to spring up. The fires were, of course, ultimately\r\nattributable to human agency, and it was probable that before the\r\ncountry was inhabited by the Indians it was everywhere densely\r\nforest-clad. That the date of the origin of the chief prairie tracts now\r\nfound is remote, was clearly evidenced by their present appearance, and\r\nmore particularly by the fact that they were everywhere scored and\r\nrutted with old buffalo tracks, while every suitable locality was pitted\r\nwith saucer shaped “buffalo wallows.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The 23rd Base Line between Townships 88 and 89, Range 14,\r\n West of the 6th Meridian.]\r\n\r\nIn its primitive state the surface was probably covered with a dense\r\nheavy growth of coniferous trees, principally the spruce (_Picea\r\nEngelmanni_ and _P. alba_), but with scrub pine (_Pinus contorta_) in\r\nsome localities, and interspersed with aspen and cottonwood. These\r\nforests having been destroyed by fire, a second growth, chiefly of\r\naspen, but with much birch in some places, and almost everywhere a\r\ncertain proportion of coniferous trees—chiefly spruce—had taken its\r\nplace. The aspen being a short-lived tree, while the spruce reached a\r\ngreat age and size, the natural course of events, if undisturbed, would\r\nlead to the re-establishment of the old spruce forests.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Mair (“Through the Mackenzie Basin”, p. 91), estimates the\r\nprairie areas of upper Peace river at about half a million acres, “with\r\nmuch country in addition, which resembles Dauphin district in Manitoba,\r\ncovered with willows and the like, which, if they can be pulled out by\r\nhorse power, as is done there, will not be very expensive to clear.”\r\n\r\nMr. Mair notes a wide and beautiful table-like prairie, begirt with\r\naspens, at Peace point.\r\n\r\nMr. Fred S. Lawrence explained to the Senate committee of 1907 that in\r\nthe valley of Peace river, the bottoms of the river, the islands—and\r\nthere are large islands in the river—and the points, are largely\r\ncovered with a heavy growth of spruce, which grows to a large size. The\r\nlargest he had ever measured was four feet four inches in diameter. A\r\ntree of that kind would carry its trunk well up, clear of branches for\r\nforty or fifty feet. Of course that is an unusual size, but timber three\r\nfeet in diameter is common on the hills, and in the lower part of the\r\nbottoms. There is no oak, but there are spruce, birch and poplar. The\r\npoplars grow to a large size. The cottonwood often grows to four feet in\r\ndiameter, and the poplar grows to a diameter of two feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NORTHERN ALBERTA.\r\n\r\n                           Economic Minerals.\r\n\r\n   Travellers, Explorers and Prospectors Describe the Country as a\r\n     Veritable Store House of Mineral Wealth.—Gold Found in the Bars\r\n     in Peace river.—Indications of Plentiful Supply of Iron.—\r\n     Lignite Found in Abundance.—Historic Deposits of Salt.—The\r\n     Famous Athabaska Tar Sands.—Their Commercial Value.—\r\n     Indications of Petroleum.—Boring Experiments.—Natural Gas\r\n     Under a Wide Area.—Travellers Use Natural Gas Jets to Boil\r\n     their Camp Kettles.\r\n\r\nNorthern Alberta, according to the reports of travellers, geological\r\nexplorers and prospectors, is a veritable storehouse of mineral wealth,\r\nits natural richness in this respect including gold, iron, coal, gypsum,\r\nsalt, sulphur, galena, natural gas, petroleum, tar sands or asphaltum,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIn his report of 1888, Mr. R. G. McConnell of the Geological Survey (See\r\np. 18) states:—“Gold was found in many of the bars in Peace river, and\r\nin several places in sufficient quantities to deserve attention. Three\r\nmiles above the mouth of Battle river, a large bar nearly a mile long on\r\nthe left bank was examined, from which we obtained fifteen to twenty\r\ncolours of fine gold, by washing a few handfuls of the mixed gravel and\r\nsand in an ordinary frying pan. We tried the bar at several points, and\r\nalways with the same result. A small stream descends from the plateau on\r\nthe opposite side of the river, and by leading its waters across the\r\nriver, which is here about one thousand feet wide, the bar might be\r\neasily and inexpensively worked on a large scale. Twelve miles farther\r\nup the river, another bar was examined, which yielded from twenty to\r\nforty colours when washed in the same way. Numerous other bars occur in\r\nthis portion of the river, which would probably give as good results as\r\nthose examined.\r\n\r\n“The presence of fine gold in some quantities in the bars above the\r\nmouth of Battle river is probably due to the diminution in the strength\r\nof the Peace river current which takes place here, and its consequent\r\nloss of transporting power. The same fact is shown in the gradual\r\nsubstitution of sand bars for gravel bars which occur at the same point.\r\n\r\n“Besides the gold on Peace river, two colours were also washed out of a\r\nbar on Loon river, an eastern tributary of the Peace.”\r\n\r\nMr. Alfred von Hamerstein, a German gentleman who has lived in the\r\nAthabaska country for many years, latterly devoting his attention wholly\r\nto prospecting for petroleum, was examined before the Senate committee\r\nof 1907 and explained that before beginning boring operations for oil,\r\nhe had been engaged in gold mining in Athabaska and Peace river\r\ndistricts. He had inspected McLeod river at a place called Assiniboia. A\r\nhalf-breed took out one hundred and fifty dollars from a bar there. He\r\nhimself\r\n\r\n                             TOOK OUT GOLD\r\n\r\nat a little bar right opposite the mouth of Lesser Slave river in the\r\nAthabaska. He worked it for part of two summers. He would take out\r\nenough to last him for the winter, and then quit. It is hard work. The\r\nIndians and natives have gold and diamonds on the brain. They had taken\r\nto him rocks containing very nice garnets, but they were very mysterious\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\nMr. von Hamerstein explained he had also worked for gold on Peace river.\r\nThere is very good mining there, a little below Battle river, but the\r\ngold is so very fine that for every dollar you save there, about four\r\nand a half go away, and there are some peculiar things that no one can\r\naccount for. After you have got it there is trouble with the\r\nquicksilver, which does not take up the gold. The method he adopted was\r\nto run the quicksilver, and then before running it over again, to roll\r\nit in acid.\r\n\r\nBefore the Senate committee of 1888, Bishop Clut stated that in Peace\r\nriver and Liard river, certainly there was gold in large quantities. On\r\nPeace river, twelve or thirteen years prior to 1888, miners made from\r\nfifteen dollars to twenty dollars a day washing, but in the winter and\r\nwhen the water was high they could not work, and they abandoned the\r\nmines. “If the country were settled,” the bishop remarked, “those mines\r\nmight be worked to better advantage, because the miners could find other\r\noccupation in the winter and when the water was high.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. von Hamerstein, at Black bay, on Lake Athabaska, there\r\nis first-class galena—none better. It carries gold, silver and copper.\r\nThey assayed some of the product at Chipewyan, and found that it carried\r\nroughly about six dollars or seven dollars worth of gold, and some\r\ncopper. There is a big seam near Black bay, and one can follow it up\r\nright along until it comes to an island. That is a very fine country for\r\ngold, and there have been several attempts to make something out of it,\r\nbut the time is not ripe.\r\n\r\n                          INDICATIONS OF IRON.\r\n\r\nIndications of the presence of iron have been found on Peace,\r\nClearwater, and Athabaska rivers. A specimen rock from near Pelican\r\nrapids on Athabaska river contained 12.4% of metallic iron. J. B.\r\nTyrrell found indications of iron in Churchill river district, and also\r\nnorth of Lake Athabaska.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. R. G. McConnell’s 1888 report:—Clay ironstone in\r\nnodules and thin beds, is of universal occurrence in the Cretaceous\r\nshales of the Peace region, but is especially abundant in some of the\r\noutcrops of the Fort St. John shales on Peace river, between Battle\r\nriver and Smoky river. The ironstone, here, owing to the rapid erosion\r\nof the soft shales, has been silted out, and in many places forms thick\r\naccumulations at the foot of the cliffs lining the valley, some of which\r\nmay prove to be of economic value. The Pelican sandstone on the\r\nAthabaska is usually capped with a bed of hemitiferous sandstone varying\r\nin thickness from a few inches to four or five feet. A specimen of the\r\nrock was examined in the laboratory of the Geological Survey, and found\r\nto contain 12·4 per cent. of metallic iron.\r\n\r\nMr. von Hamerstein, in his evidence before the Senate committee of 1907,\r\nstated that there are indications of iron along Clearwater river. He\r\nfound some very nice pieces of iron, and he found limestone in the\r\ncentre of Athabaska.\r\n\r\nOnce, in Peace river district, on the way from Lake Chipewyan, he found\r\na deposit of red stone; he did not know whether it was ochre or hematite\r\nof iron. He had any amount of it, but upset with his canoe and lost it.\r\nA large amount of ochre is found on the eastern bank of the Athabaska,\r\nbetween Athabaska and Grand rapids. He had also observed what seemed to\r\nhim a large amount of hematite of iron between Athabaska and the mouth\r\nof greater Slave river, while on Slave river itself, at a certain point,\r\nlarge bodies of magnetic ore are indicated by the action of the compass,\r\nwhich gets entirely out of order.\r\n\r\n                           COAL AND LIGNITE.\r\n\r\nMr. von Hamerstein informed the committee that there is a fine seam of\r\ncoal at McKay, and went on to say that he had taken out, the season\r\nbefore his examination by the committee, about twenty tons, right on the\r\nriver bank. There was a good quantity of bituminous coal, which could be\r\nused for common blacksmithing, but not for welding. Where exposed and\r\nworked, this seam goes down about five or six feet deep, and it seems to\r\nbe getting larger. There is quite a bit of coal taken out every year by\r\nthe people who live at Chipewyan.\r\n\r\nThere is, according to Mr. von Hamerstein, another fine seam of coal at\r\na little creek named Horse creek, which is about a mile and a half south\r\nfrom McMurray on the east side of Athabaska river. Coal may also be\r\nfound in other places. There is a seam, for instance, about two miles\r\nbelow Stony island.\r\n\r\nW. F. Bredin, M.L.A., confirmed Mr. von Hamerstein’s evidence as to the\r\ndeposits of coal near McKay, which is about twenty miles north of\r\nMcMurray.\r\n\r\nIn his report of 1888, describing his explorations the previous season,\r\nMr. R. G. McConnell stated:—\r\n\r\n“Lignite was found in Peace river sandstone in Peace river in several\r\nplaces, but in seams too small to be workable. It also occurs in the\r\nplateaus south of Lesser Slave lake. In one section at the latter place,\r\nfour seams, ranging in thickness from one to four feet, besides a number\r\nof smaller ones, was found, distributed through about a thousand feet of\r\nsandstone and shales. Drift lignite was also found in Marten river near\r\nthe base of Marten mountain, but it was not traced to its source. On the\r\nAthabaska, the Grand rapid sandstone is lignitiferous, some of the seams\r\nbeing from four to five feet thick, but the quality is usually inferior.\r\nSeveral small seams also occur imbedded in the tar sands.”\r\n\r\n                          DEPOSITS OF GYPSUM.\r\n\r\nMr. McConnell states in his report that “Gypsum is deposited in small\r\nquantities by the mineral springs at La Saline, and it also occurs on\r\nPeace river between Bouillé rapid and Peace point, where beds ten to\r\nfifteen feet in thickness are said to exist. Blocks of gypsum several\r\nfeet in diameter were found on Peace river above its confluence with\r\nLoon river, and on Red river a few miles above its mouth. They have\r\nprobably been derived from the Peace point exposures, and carried up the\r\nvalley of Peace river by ice during the Glacial period.”\r\n\r\nMr. Alfred von Hamerstein gave evidence to the same effect before the\r\nSenate committee of 1907. He stated that there “are large deposits of\r\ngypsum on the southern bank of Peace river, near Peace point, which is\r\nsituated somewhere near the mouth of Peace river. Very large deposits of\r\nthe same economic mineral are in the neighbourhood of Salt river.”\r\n\r\n                              SALT MINES.\r\n\r\nHarmon, writing in his journal at Chipewyan as long ago as 1808,\r\nwrote:—“About sixty miles from this, down Slave river, there are\r\nseveral places where almost any quantity of excellent, clean, white salt\r\nmay be taken, with as much ease as sand along the sea shore. From these\r\nplaces, the greater part of the North West is supplied with this\r\nvaluable article.”\r\n\r\nBefore the Senate committee of 1907, Mr. von Hamerstein stated that at\r\nSalt river, salt was found right on the surface. There is a spring which\r\ncomes out of the ground, and the water is so salty that it cannot take\r\nup any more. Right at McMurray one hundred and fifty feet of rock salt\r\nwas found. The traders and Hudson’s Bay Company’s people come down and\r\ntake it with shovels, and they sell all the salt that is used along\r\nthere. It is taken from Salt river. Witness did not know what they got\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nIn his report of 1888, Mr. McConnell writes:—“At La Saline, on the\r\nAthabaska, twenty-eight miles below the Forks, and about two miles above\r\nthe mouth of Red Earth creek, several mineral springs occur about half a\r\nmile east of the river on the edge of the valley there, sixty feet deep.\r\nThe deposits from the springs, consisting principally of calcareous\r\ntufa, cover the face of the escarpment and have also built up a cone on\r\nthe top of the bank ten to fifteen feet high and about two hundred feet\r\nwide. The water is strongly saline, holding a considerable percentage of\r\nsodic-chloride. Sulphuretted hydrogen gas escapes from the bank in\r\nseveral places and taints the air for some distance from the springs.\r\nBesides the calcareous tufa the cone contains small deposits of common\r\nsalt, gypsum and native sulphur, while pure tar, derived from the tar\r\nsands beneath, issues from the bank in two places. The springs feed a\r\nshallow lake which is situated at the foot of the escarpment, and is\r\nsurrounded by a clay flat partly bare and partly covered with coarse\r\ngrasses.”\r\n\r\n                       SULPHUR BEDS AND SPRINGS.\r\n\r\nWhile giving evidence before the select committee of the Senate in 1907,\r\nMr. von Hamerstein explained that there are sulphur beds and springs\r\nbetween McMurray and Lake Athabaska. Extensive sulphur deposits are\r\nfound on the east side of Athabaska river between McMurray and the lake.\r\nIt is inland about two miles, and in some places it is found in large\r\nquantities, and beyond the lake, at several places on the east shore, as\r\nwell as the west shore of Great Slave river. In some places there is a\r\nvery large amount of sulphur. It comes from an old crater, in the shape\r\nof saline water, containing a large amount of sulphur. This saline water\r\nat spots runs over three or four acres, the water evaporates, and the\r\nsulphur remains.\r\n\r\nMr. von Hamerstein also stated that on “the lower part of the Athabaska\r\nthe limestone which is exposed all along the river is of a very good\r\nquality. There is also found clay fit for puddling and for making\r\nbrick.” He added that sand of the very best quality for making glass is\r\nabundant, and this industry Mr. von Hamerstein said he believed was\r\nbound to come into existence and be profitable through the existence of\r\ncheap fuel, and intense heat in the shape of natural gas in the country.\r\n\r\n                        THE FAMOUS “TAR SANDS.”\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of huge deposits of an oily bituminous or tarry substance\r\nalong Athabaska river was referred to in the journals of the pioneer\r\nexplorers of the region. In the account of his historical journal in\r\n1879, Mackenzie mentions that the exudation of the “bituminous\r\nfountains”, as he called them, when mixed with gum or the resinous\r\nsubstance collected from the spruce fir, was used by the natives and\r\nvoyageurs to gum their canoes. After investigating the character of\r\nthese deposits, geologists have agreed in describing the black plastic\r\nmass as “Tar Sands.”\r\n\r\nMr. McConnell described these deposits as resting on the limestone and\r\nwell exposed in high cliffs on both sides of Athabaska river. At Cascade\r\nrapid, this formation is one hundred and fifty feet thick and is so\r\nsaturated that pure tar oozes out of the bank in several places and\r\nstreams down the slope. Mr. McConnell proceeds in his report to\r\nsay:—“The tar-sands mentioned above belong to the Dakota formation and\r\nconstitute in this region the basal member of the Cretaceous system.\r\nThey rest unconformably on the Devonian limestones. Lithologically they\r\nmay be described as soft sandstone, the cementing material of which is a\r\nbitumen or inspissated petroleum derived from the underlying limestones.\r\nThe sands are siliceous and usually rather fine-grained, but also grade\r\noccasionally into a coherent grit. The eastern boundary of the tar-sands\r\nwas not precisely defined, but their outcrop was estimated to have a\r\nminimum distribution of fully one thousand square miles. In thickness\r\nthey vary from one hundred and fifty to two hundred and twenty-five\r\nfeet. The tar is unequally distributed through the sands, in some places\r\nmerely staining the grains, but in most of the sections examined it is\r\npresent in sufficient quantity to render the whole mass more or less\r\nplastic. An analysis by Mr. Hoffmann of a specimen collected some years\r\nago by Doctor Bell gave by weight:—\r\n\r\n             Bitumen                         12·42 per cent.\r\n             Water (mechanically mixed)       5·85 per cent.\r\n             Siliceous sands                 81·73 per cent.\r\n\r\nA cubic foot of the bituminous sand rock weighs, according to Mr.\r\nHoffmann, 117·5 lbs. This figure multiplied by the percentage of\r\nbitumen, 12·42, gives 14·59 lbs. as the amount of bitumen present in a\r\ncubic foot, or 14·59/63·7 = 22·9 per cent. in bulk, taking 63·7 pounds\r\nas the weight of one cubic foot of rock. At the minimum thickness of one\r\nhundred and fifty feet, and assuming the thickness as given above at one\r\nthousand square miles, the bituminous sand rock in sight amounts to\r\n28·40 cubic miles. Of this mass, if the preceding analysis is taken as\r\nan average, although this is probably rather high, 22·9 per cent. in\r\nbulk or 6·50 cubic miles is bitumen. This calculation can, of course,\r\nonly be regarded as an approximation, but will serve to give some idea\r\nof the enormous outpouring of bituminous substances which have taken\r\nplace in this region. The amount of petroleum which must have issued\r\nfrom the underlying limestones required to produce 6·50 cubic miles of\r\nbitumen cannot be estimated, as the conditions of oxidation and the\r\noriginal composition of the oil are unknown. It must, however, have been\r\nmuch greater than the amount of bitumen.\r\n\r\n“A few miles west of the Athabaska the sand rock, still saturated with\r\ntar, passes below the higher divisions of the Cretaceous, and its\r\nextension in this direction can only be ascertained by boring. It was\r\nnot recognized on Peace river nor on the lower part of Red river, and\r\nmust disappear somewhere in the intervening region.\r\n\r\n“In ascending the Athabaska the tar-sands, after an exposure of over\r\ntwenty miles, pass below the surface at Boiler rapid and are not seen\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n                   COMMERCIAL VALUE OF THE TAR SANDS.\r\n\r\nAs to the actual value of these deposits, Mr. McConnell has this to say\r\nin his report:—“The commercial value of the tar sands themselves, as\r\nexposed at the surface, is at present uncertain, but the abundance of\r\nthe material, and the high percentage of bitumen which it contains, make\r\nit probable that it may, in the future, be profitably utilized for\r\nvarious purposes, when this region is reached by railways. Among the\r\nuses to which it is adapted, may be mentioned roofing, paving,\r\ninsulating electric wires, and it might also be mixed with the lignite\r\nwhich occurs in the neighbourhood, and pressed into briquettes for\r\nfuel.”\r\n\r\nBefore the Senate committee of 1907 Mr. von Hamerstein was examined at\r\nlength regarding these beds of tar sands, or “asphaltum,” as he called\r\nit, and as it is generally called in the district. He described these\r\nbeds as occurring where petroleum seemed to have broken through the\r\nsurface and soaked the ground for miles around. This substance, Mr. von\r\nHamerstein remarked, could scarcely be termed asphaltum. It is oil\r\ngum—something the nature of tar. He produced a piece of this material\r\nwhich he had taken out himself. He also produced a bottle containing\r\nliquid taken from springs in the ground. He described it as nothing else\r\nbut a heavy petroleum, which comes out of the ground. There are\r\ninexhaustible quantities of that. It has formed pools over the land\r\nwhich are of considerable size in some places. In summer time it comes\r\nout in large quantities, but it hardens in the winter, and of course the\r\nsprings take time to get started again. It is not flowing continuously,\r\nbut flows whenever it has a chance. The cold seems to draw it together\r\nand bake it. This is the largest quantity of petroleum witness had ever\r\nseen in the world. This area extends from McMurray for fifty miles along\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\nMr. von Hamerstein said he thought there was\r\n\r\n                     NOTHING LIKE IT IN THE WORLD.\r\n\r\nHe had been in Texas, Kansas, and Indian Territory, and had looked over\r\nthe asphalt beds in California, but had found nothing to compare with\r\nit. This “asphalt” does not resemble Trinidad asphalt, for the latter\r\ncomes from a crater, and the substance is not the same. The Athabaska\r\nsubstance is not straight asphalt; it is nothing but oil gum, out of\r\nwhich asphalt can be made. There is a large amount of petroleum in it.\r\nHe tested it himself, and got some paraffin out of it. If he could\r\nobtain transportation, he could apply it for practical purposes. After\r\nit is refined, and all the foreign substance taken out of it, it can be\r\nused for road making.\r\n\r\nLubricating oil can be made out of it, and in fact he made cylinder oil\r\nfor his machinery out of it, and also got some paraffin out of it. The\r\nrest he used for making tar paper. This product would certainly become\r\nvaluable as soon as there was transportation. The area covered by this\r\nsubstance amounts to about twenty square miles.\r\n\r\nMr. J. B. Tyrrell, in his evidence before the same committee, referred\r\nto these outcrops of tar sands. There is, he stated, an enormous amount\r\nof sandstone there impregnated with hard thick petroleum of tar. The\r\nprobability is that when one gets back from the outcrop in some places\r\nthis substance will be found as a liquid oil instead of a hard tar that\r\nis found there on the Athabaska. Mr. Tyrrell said he thought it quite a\r\nfair and reasonable supposition that one would find good fluid oil in\r\nthe beds of the same geological age as the tar sand of Athabaska river.\r\nThis tar sand is very strongly in evidence along the river, and an\r\nenormous amount of tar has actually gone to waste, as it were—floated\r\nout and hardened there. The tar sand area extends for quite a number of\r\nmiles along the river. As you descend the river you get to those\r\ntar-bearing beds, and then they are in evidence right along for a number\r\nof miles down the river. Then you leave them altogether, and they do not\r\noccur again. Mr. Tyrrell considered it highly probable that the\r\npetroleum or liquid would be found in close proximity. Of course the\r\nsandstone or tar would not have a marketable value at the present rates\r\nof transportation, but, outside of that, probably it would be used as\r\npaving material if it is ever needed in that vicinity. He thought it\r\n\r\n                   COULD BE USED FOR MAKING PAVEMENT.\r\n\r\nR. W. Ells, LL.D., F.R.S.C., in the Geological Survey report on “The\r\nBitumen or Oil Shales of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, also on the Oil\r\nShale Industry of Scotland,” says:—“The celebrated tar-sands of\r\nAthabaska river in Northern Alberta may at some time furnish material\r\nfor distillation, since all attempts to find oil by boring have hitherto\r\nbeen unsuccessful. These tar-sands have been well described by Doctor\r\nBell, and other officers of the Geological Survey who have visited the\r\narea. Doctor Bell, after describing the immense amount of tarry matter\r\nfound along the river, states that ‘the pitchy sand itself may be useful\r\nfor a variety of purposes. When chopped out of the bank in lumps like\r\ncoal it was found to burn freely, with a strong smoky flame, if\r\nsupported in such a way as to admit of the free access of air. As the\r\nbitumen became exhausted the fine sand fell to the bottom.’ . . . . A\r\nvery superior lubricating oil may be manufactured from it. Doctor\r\nHoffmann of the Geological Survey, Mr. Isaac Waterman, the well known\r\npetroleum refiner of London, Ontario, and Lieutenant Cochrane,\r\nInstructor in Practical Chemistry at the Military College, Kingston,\r\nhave found it to contain twelve to fifteen per cent. of bitumen.\r\nAlthough this proportion may appear small, yet the material occurs in\r\nsuch enormous quantities that a profitable means of extracting the oil\r\nand paraffin which it contains may be found. The high banks of the river\r\nand its branches offer an easy means of excavating it, and as it burns\r\nreadily one part might be consumed to extract the oil from another,\r\nthere being practically no limit to the quantity which may be obtained\r\nfor the digging.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oil Well at McKay, Athabaska river.]\r\n\r\nDoctor Bell, in a paper before the American Institute of Mining\r\nEngineers, Toronto, July, 1907, said:—“Different experiments made with\r\nthe tar-sands show that while they yield some good illuminating fluid,\r\ntheir principal value consists in the large proportion of\r\n\r\n                          FINE LUBRICATING OIL\r\n\r\nwhich they afford. This oil was found to remain liquid in the cold\r\nwinter temperatures of the Canadian prairie provinces, and therefore, it\r\nis very suitable for car wheels and machinery working in the open air.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crean in the report of his explorations in 1909 states:—“The\r\noutcrop of tar-sand commences about thirty miles south of McMurray on\r\nAthabaska river. It continues to about forty miles below McMurray on the\r\nriver. It extends to the east and west for at least thirty miles, and\r\nvaries in thickness from twenty to two hundred and twenty-five feet,\r\nwith probably an average of one hundred and fifty feet\r\nthickness. . . . . The value of this immense deposit on the Athabaska is\r\nnot known. . . . . During the past season representatives of interests\r\nin England and France have made examinations of it on the ground. Should\r\nit be found to be capable of being converted to any commercial use, the\r\nenormous extent of it would ensure that industries of considerable\r\npublic importance would be established in connection with it as soon as\r\nrailway communication is provided. Since Mr. McConnell’s report was\r\npublished, several other outcrops of the mineral have been reported. A.\r\nW. Ponton, D.L.S., reports an outcrop near the fifth meridian, which is\r\nabout ninety miles west of McMurray. I reported an outcrop of tar-sand\r\nin my report of last season on Buffalo lake which is one hundred and\r\ntwenty miles southeast and in the province of Saskatchewan. That these\r\noutcrops are part of the same field is probable.”\r\n\r\n                       INDICATIONS OF PETROLEUM.\r\n\r\nApart altogether from the commercial value of the tar sands themselves,\r\nthey are regarded by many geologists and practical operators as chiefly\r\nimportant as indicating the existence of deposits of petroleum. For\r\ninstance, as long ago as 1888, Doctor G. M. Dawson of the Geological\r\nSurvey stated before the Senate committee:—“The pitch found along the\r\nAthabaska may probably be of considerable value in the future; but in\r\nthe meantime was most important as giving reason to believe that\r\nextensive deposits of petroleum existed in the country in which it\r\noccurred. The quantity appeared to be practically inexhaustible.”\r\n\r\nMr. McConnell, in his report, enters very thoroughly into this phase of\r\nthe question. He writes:—“The tar sands evidence an upwelling of\r\npetroleum to the surface unequalled elsewhere in the world, but the more\r\nvolatile and valuable constituents of the oil have long since\r\ndisappeared, and the rocks from which it issued are probably exhausted\r\nas the flow has ceased. In the extension of the tar sands under cover\r\nthe conditions are different, and it is here that oils of economic value\r\nshould be sought. In ascending the Athabaska, the tar sands are overlaid\r\nat Boiler rapid by a cover of shales sufficient to prevent the oils from\r\nrising to the surface, and in ascending the river, this cover gradually\r\nthickens. The geological attitudes of the shales is not the most\r\nfavorable, as the beds dip away from the outcrop at the rate of five to\r\nten feet to the mile, and it is possible that a part, or even the whole\r\nof the oil may have flowed northwards and eastwards through the sands,\r\nand escaped where these come to the surface. It is unlikely, however,\r\nthat all the oil has escaped in this manner, as small anticlinals in the\r\ncovering beds are almost certain to exist, and a differential hardening\r\nof the beds themselves may serve to enclose reservoirs or inverted\r\nbasins of large capacity. It is also possible that the sands at their\r\noutcrop may, by the deposition of tarry substances, be plugged tightly\r\nenough to prevent further egress. Favourable indications of the presence\r\nof oil in the vicinity of the Athabaska are also afforded by the\r\nexistence of the natural gas springs.”\r\n\r\n                         TAR SPRINGS REPORTED.\r\n\r\nMr. McConnell proceeds to show that “Indications of the presence of oil\r\nin the district are not confined to the tar sands, as on Peace river and\r\nLesser Slave lake inspissated bitumen was found in a number of places\r\nlining cracks in nodules, and at Tar island in Peace river small\r\nquantities of tar are brought to the surface by a spring. Tar springs\r\nare also reported from several other places, but their existence lacks\r\nverification.”\r\n\r\nIn his Summary Report of the operations of the Geological Survey, for\r\nthe year 1894, Doctor G. M. Dawson, the director, referring to Mr.\r\nMcConnell’s explorations and report, wrote:—“The occurrence of great\r\nquantities of bitumen or maltha along a portion of Athabaska river has\r\nlong been known, having been noticed and commented upon by the very\r\nearliest travellers in the region. Beds of sand or very soft sandstone\r\nof Cretaceous age, varying from one hundred and forty to two hundred and\r\ntwenty-five feet in thickness, are there found to be more or less\r\ncompletely saturated with bitumen, for a distance of some ninety miles\r\nalong the river. These beds are known as ‘tar sands.’ More recently a\r\nnumber of smaller occurrences of bitumen in the form of ‘tar springs’ as\r\nwell as sources of combustible gas, have been found at different places\r\nover a very extensive district. All these circumstances point to the\r\nprobable existence of a great petroleum field, of which possibly some\r\nparts have already exhausted themselves in saturating the lowest\r\nCretaceous sands, but of which probably the greater portion is still\r\neffectually sealed by the thick covering of overlying rocks. It is\r\nbelieved that the source of the petroleum which has given rise to the\r\ndeposits of bitumen is in the Devonian strata, which here immediately\r\nunderlie those of Cretaceous age.”\r\n\r\n                         EXPERIMENTAL BORINGS.\r\n\r\nIn 1893, at the suggestion of Mr. McConnell and Doctor Dawson, the\r\nDominion government began experimental borings for petroleum in the\r\nAthabaska region.\r\n\r\nThe importance of actually ascertaining by means of boring operations,\r\nthe existence or otherwise of economically valuable bodies of petroleum\r\nin the region had been recognized for many years, but the remoteness of\r\nthe region and the apparent impossibility of immediately utilizing any\r\ndiscoveries which might be made, had hitherto prevented the necessary\r\nexperiments. A vote of seven thousand dollars was obtained from\r\nParliament for the purpose of initiating this work, the arrangements for\r\nwhich were entrusted to the Geological Survey. After careful\r\nconsideration, it was determined that a bore-hole should in the first\r\ninstance be sunk at Athabaska, at which place the depth of strata to be\r\npassed through in order to reach the horizon of the “tar sands” had been\r\nestimated by Mr. McConnell at approximately from twelve to fifteen\r\nhundred feet.\r\n\r\nOn October 24 the bore-hole had reached a depth of one thousand and\r\neleven feet, when it was found necessary, owing to the incoherent\r\ncharacter of the rocks, to stop work pending the arrival of more casing.\r\nThis was placed in the hole during the winter, but the drilling itself\r\ncould not be resumed till the spring, as the great quantity of gas met\r\nwith rendered it dangerous to keep a fire in the derrick or anywhere in\r\nthe vicinity of the well. This first boring was unavoidably abandoned at\r\na depth of one thousand seven hundred and seventy feet, without reaching\r\nthe probably oil-bearing beds at the base of the Cretaceous formation\r\nbut within a short distance of attaining these beds.\r\n\r\nDuring these particular boring operations, according to the engineer in\r\ncharge, at three hundred and thirty-four feet a large flow of gas was\r\nstruck. The roaring of the gas could be heard half a mile away from the\r\nworks. The foreman who had seen the big gas well at Kingsville, Ontario,\r\nstated that the flow of gas was as strong as in that well.\r\n\r\n                       SECOND AND THIRD BORINGS.\r\n\r\nThe second and third of the experimental borings in search of petroleum\r\nin the northern part of Alberta were begun early in the summer of 1897\r\nnear the mouth of Pelican river on the Athabaska and at Victoria on the\r\nSaskatchewan below Edmonton, respectively. The sites selected for these\r\nborings were determined largely by the knowledge of the stratigraphical\r\nsuccession and the thickness already gained in the first bore-hole at\r\nAthabaska. The borings at Pelican and Victoria had reached depths of\r\neight hundred and twenty and seven hundred and five feet respectively\r\nbefore winter. Operations were resumed at both places in the spring of\r\n1898, as soon as the requisite arrangements could be made. Work had been\r\nsuspended at Pelican in 1897 because of a very large flow of natural\r\ngas, under great pressure. It was hoped that most of this gas might blow\r\noff during the winter, and it was found, in fact, to be considerably\r\nreduced in amount when the locality was again reached by the engineer in\r\ncharge in 1898. Work was resumed, but additional and very strong flows\r\nof gas were soon met with in the underlying beds, and after exhausting\r\nevery method of mastering them and continuing the boring, it became\r\nnecessary again to suspend operations.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the actual existence of petroleum, the results of the\r\ngovernment borings have not up to the present stage been satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe boring near the mouth of Pelican river penetrated the lower sandy\r\nbeds of the Cretaceous for some distance and demonstrated the existence\r\nin these beds of a thick tarry petroleum or maltha, besides that of\r\ngreat reservoirs of natural gas. It proved impossible to carry out this\r\nboring to the very base of the Cretaceous and into the underlying\r\nformation, in which the existence of a more fluid and merchantable oil\r\nwas still to be hoped for.\r\n\r\nDoctor Dawson, reporting upon the result of these operations,\r\nstated:—“The bore furnishes additional evidence of the existence in the\r\nNorthwest territories of a vast gas-field. The seemingly uniform\r\ncontinuity of the Cretaceous beds, makes it almost certain that\r\ngas-wells may be obtained by boring, over a great area. Unfortunately\r\nthe Pelican boring, like the boring at Athabaska, did not penetrate deep\r\nenough to furnish reliable information as to the existence or\r\nnon-existence of petroleum of a high quality. The presence of\r\nlow-quality petroleum—maltha—is demonstrated, but as the more liquid\r\noil may very probably underlie this, and as we did not reach a\r\nsufficient depth to determine the point, the result is unsatisfactory.”\r\n\r\n                      WHY THE BORING WAS STOPPED.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from the report of the engineer in charge of the\r\nboring operations at Pelican river, Mr. A. W. Fraser, are interesting,\r\nand show how and why the operations came to an abrupt termination:—“I\r\nused some of the heavy petroleum or maltha which flowed from the well in\r\nraising steam, and it made an extremely good fuel.\r\n\r\n“If the hard slate stratum at eight hundred and twenty-one feet six\r\ninches had been pierced, a great flow of petroleum might have, in my\r\nopinion, been encountered. Indeed it is altogether possible that at that\r\ndepth we were within a few feet of a large body of petroleum. Had it\r\nbeen struck while the flow of gas was in an unconquered condition, the\r\nresult would have been disastrous, as there might have been no possible\r\nmeans of checking the flow. The flow of gas was so great that a cannon\r\nball could not have been dropped down the pipe.\r\n\r\n“At seven hundred and seventy three feet a heavier flow of gas was\r\nstruck. It made a roaring noise coming out of the bore, and had quite a\r\npronounced petroleum odour. Increased quantities of petroleum in the\r\ncuttings at these depths were encountered.\r\n\r\n“At eight hundred and twenty feet a tremendous flow of gas was struck,\r\nwhich blew every drop of water out of the bore. The roar of the gas\r\ncould be heard for three miles or more. Soon it had completely dried the\r\nhole, and was blowing a cloud of dust fifty feet into the air. Small\r\nnodules of iron-pyrites, about the size of a walnut, were blown out of\r\nthe hole with incredible velocity. They came out like bullets from a\r\nrifle. We could not see them going, but could hear them crack against\r\nthe top of the derrick. It was impossible to do anything with the bore\r\nthat day, so we were forced to let it stand just as it was. There was\r\ndanger that the men would be killed if struck by these missiles. The\r\nnext day a long stick was put on the tools, so that the men could turn\r\nthem without getting too close to the bore. In this way we succeeded in\r\npenetrating through eighteen inches of a conglomerate mass of these\r\niron-pyrites nodules embedded in heavy petroleum. As we drilled through\r\nthis the gas blew out the nodules of iron-pyrites embedded in oil.\r\n\r\n“At eight hundred and twenty-one feet six inches a very hard stratum of\r\nslate was encountered, which we penetrated about three inches. We could\r\nget no water down the well on account of the strong flow of gas, so we\r\ncould make no further progress with the drill in this hard cutting. The\r\ndanger to the men was so great that they refused to work longer over the\r\nbore. We then put the four and five-eighths inch casing down to the very\r\nbottom, hoping to shut off gas, but it failed to do so.”\r\n\r\n                   TERRIFIC PRESSURE OF NATURAL GAS.\r\n\r\nWork was resumed here in 1898 (Geological Survey Report, Vol. XI, page\r\n33a). It was thought that the flow of gas might have decreased, but on\r\nwork being resumed and the hole being cleaned out “the gas which had\r\nincreased in power with the cleaning of the hole cut the walls down and\r\nblew great clouds of sand and gravel higher than the derrick.”\r\nSubsequently at eight hundred and thirty-seven feet such a strong flow\r\nof gas was struck that they were obliged to suspend operations. Mr.\r\nFraser further says in the same report:—“I proved the general\r\nexcellence and utility of the gas during the season, using it for my\r\nboiler, cookstove and for lighting. I had only a one inch pipe, tapped\r\ninto the side of the casing, and probably did not use the one-hundredth\r\npart of the gas coming from the bore, but there was sufficient to make\r\nall the steam necessary on my twenty-five horse-power boiler, keep fire\r\nin the stove, and also to supply a strong flare-light. The gas burned\r\nbeautifully clean. In working at the bore, the screeching and hissing of\r\nthe gas, when at all confined by the presence of the tools inside the\r\ncasing, or from other causes, was so great that the men complained of\r\npains in their ears and heads.”\r\n\r\n                         BEGGED TO BE EXCUSED.\r\n\r\nWhen giving his evidence before the Senate committee of 1907 Mr. von\r\nHamerstein begged to be excused from divulging results of his work in\r\nboring for petroleum in the McMurray district, as other people had\r\nentrusted their money with him in the enterprise. He said he felt at\r\nliberty to state that their works so far made him very confident that\r\nthey were going to have one of the biggest petroleum fields in the\r\nworld. There was no doubt he said, petroleum would be found all through\r\nthat country, from Athabaska river to Peace river. He remarked that when\r\nhis party was boring once they struck natural gas, and one hundred and\r\nfifty feet of salt. They went down through a hundred feet of salt, and\r\nthen they abandoned it. At this particular place they went about eleven\r\nhundred feet altogether. They never went lower than eleven hundred feet.\r\n\r\nMr. von Hamerstein added: “As far as petroleum is concerned, I have all\r\nmy money put into it, and there is other people’s money in it, and I\r\nhave to be loyal. As to whether you can get petroleum in merchantable\r\nquantities, that is a matter about which I would not care to speak. I\r\nhave been taking in machinery for about three years. Last year I placed\r\nabout fifty thousand dollars worth of machinery in there. I have not\r\nbrought it in for ornamental purposes, although it does look nice and\r\nhome-like.”\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1910, Corporal A. H. Schurer, of the Royal Northwest\r\nMounted Police, made a patrol from Athabaska to McMurray. In his report\r\nhe states:—“I visited the oil wells sunk by Baron A. von Hamerstein at\r\nPoplar island, six miles below McMurray. I could see very little with\r\nthe exception of the machinery, as the snow had covered everything up. A\r\nMr. Falkner, supposed to be representing a party of eastern capitalists,\r\nhas been staking out claims between McMurray and McKay for oil, during\r\nthe past two months, and I understand that he is also to prospect\r\nClearwater river east of McMurray for petroleum and other minerals. In\r\nDecember last Mr. Julius Alteschul, a German, claiming to be a\r\nrepresentative of a London, England, financial house, visited McMurray,\r\nand after having been there for a few days, stated that he had found a\r\nmineral more valuable than radium, and that as soon as Athabaska river\r\nwas navigable, he would place one hundred workmen and their families at\r\nMcMurray, where he intended to start an industry; what this industry was\r\nto be Mr. Alteschul did not make clear. It is the general impression\r\nthat Alteschul was merely paying a visit to a much talked of place in\r\norder to find out what minerals actually existed, but did not want his\r\nmission to be known.”\r\n\r\n                              NATURAL GAS.\r\n\r\nCorporal Mellor states (Royal Northwest Mounted Police report of 1909)\r\nthat when patrolling the buffalo country near Peace point he came across\r\n“a large natural gas spout burning in a muskeg and was informed it never\r\ngoes out.”\r\n\r\nDuring his examination before the select committee of the Senate in 1907\r\nMr. von Hamerstein drew the attention of the committee to the waste of\r\nnatural oil gas at the government bore hole at Pelican portage or\r\nPelican rapids. It was still burning. When Mr. von Hamerstein went up in\r\nthe month of June, 1906, it blew about eighteen or twenty feet. About\r\nfour years previously he found it was about forty feet, a vertical\r\nstream. It exploded with such force that not a hundredth part of the gas\r\nhad a chance to be inflamed. The ground all around it had fallen in. Mr.\r\nvon Hamerstein expressed the opinion that this is the biggest gas well\r\non the face of the earth. He had a gas expert, a Mr. Chamberlain, from\r\nPetrolia, who told him that it was the biggest well in the world. Mr.\r\nChamberlain operated in Indiana, Kansas, and all over the United States,\r\nand was the largest operator in the natural gas business.\r\n\r\nIn connection with their prospecting, mining and boring operations in\r\nAthabaska district Mr. von Hamerstein’s parties use quantities of\r\nnatural gas for lighting purposes. They light their camps with it, and\r\ndo their blacksmithing with it, and it comes in very handy. They get the\r\ngas at all kinds of depths, and get several veins of it. They never get\r\npetroleum without gas, as they have to strike gas before they strike\r\npetroleum, so there must be a large quantity of petroleum there.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. von Hamerstein’s evidence upon this occasion, on Peace\r\nriver there is evidence of natural gas also, small amounts of tar and\r\nalso evidence of petroleum. That would be sixteen miles from Peace River\r\nLanding, on an island called Tar island. The natural gas springs there\r\nthrow out small amounts of tar, and about thirty miles from the mouth,\r\non the north shore, there is also a spring. It is what Mr. von\r\nHamerstein called an oil spring or tar spring.\r\n\r\nW. F. Bredin, M. L. A., before the Senate committee of 1907, stated that\r\nfor miles along Athabaska river the natural gas is all the time escaping\r\nfrom the clay banks of the river and in the river itself, because all\r\nacross the river you can see the bubbles rising. The witness had lighted\r\nsome of the gas vents, and boiled his tea pail by hanging it over the\r\nflame.\r\n\r\n                      MORE IMPORTANT GAS SPRINGS.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. McConnell, the most important natural gas spring in the\r\ndistrict occurs on the Athabaska at the mouth of Little Buffalo river.\r\nThe gas here forces its way up from the tar sands, through two hundred\r\nand fifty feet of the Clearwater shales and issues from the surface in\r\nnumerous small jets distributed over an area fifty feet or more in\r\ndiameter. Some of the jets burn steadily when lighted, until\r\nextinguished by heavy rains or strong wind, and afford sufficient heat\r\nto cook a camp meal. A second spring was noticed on the left bank of the\r\nAthabaska about thirteen miles below the mouth of Pelican river. The\r\nvolume of gas escaping here is less than at the mouth of Little Buffalo\r\nriver, and in order to reach the surface it is obliged to penetrate five\r\nhundred and seventy feet of shales and sandstone which here overlie the\r\ntar sands. Escaping jets of gas were also noted at several points\r\nfarther up the river; but these were mostly small and may possibly be\r\ndue to decaying vegetable matter. On Peace river natural gas issues from\r\nthe tar springs on Tar island, in small quantities.\r\n\r\nMr. McConnell adds:—“The natural gas springs have less value in\r\nthemselves at present than in the indications they afford of the\r\nexistence of petroleum beneath.”\r\n\r\nIn his introduction to Mr. G. A. Young’s descriptive sketch of the\r\ngeology and economic minerals of Canada (1909) Mr. R. W. Brock, Director\r\nof the Geological Survey, wrote:—“Petroleum and natural gas are\r\nobtained in Ontario; Alberta is also producing a large quantity of gas,\r\nand will probably develop petroleum fields. . . . . The interior plain\r\n(of the Canadian northwest) is underlain for the most part by\r\nsedimentary rocks, chiefly of Cretaceous age, and containing coal,\r\nbuilding stones, clays, and cement materials. Natural gas over wide\r\nareas and under great pressure has been tapped, and there is every\r\nindication of a large oil field in the northern portion, at least, of\r\nAlberta.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NORTHERN ALBERTA.\r\n\r\n                  Game, Fur-bearing Animals and Fish.\r\n\r\n   The Land of the Wood Buffalo.—Where the Last Remnant of American\r\n     Bison Living in a Wild State Roam.—A Splendid Moose Country.—\r\n     The Home of Numerous Fur-bearing Animals.—The Prolific\r\n     Fisheries of Lake Athabaska and Other Waters.\r\n\r\nAs the northernmost portion of northern Alberta includes a considerable\r\npart of the range of the herds of wood buffalo (_Bison athabascae_),\r\nwhich are the sole remnant, living in a natural state, of the countless\r\nmillions of American bison which existed when the northwest was first\r\nopened up, it is a country of especial interest to the naturalist and\r\nsportsman. It seems to be agreed that the wood buffalo is exactly the\r\nsame species as the buffalo of the plains, being descended from herds or\r\nindividuals which drifted into the wooded country to the north for\r\npasturage or protection, and finding conditions congenial remained\r\nthere. Within the memory of living men the wood buffalo of northern\r\nAlberta and beyond were immeasurably more numerous than they are to-day,\r\nand they would probably have suffered extermination before this had the\r\nDominion government not stepped in and enacted laws to protect closely\r\nthe remaining herds.\r\n\r\nThe wood bison formerly ranged over immense areas north to Great Slave\r\nlake and Liard river, but it is now restricted to a few small herds\r\ninhabiting the region north of Peace river.\r\n\r\nThe bison was first recorded from this region by Samuel Hearne, the\r\nfirst traveller to penetrate its unknown wilds. After crossing Great\r\nSlave lake (his Athapapuskow lake) from the north, in January, 1772, he\r\nentered the level country to the eastward of Slave river, and there\r\n“found buffaloes very plentiful.” He travelled southward for some days\r\nand then left Slave river and proceeded to the eastward, still finding\r\nthe animals abundant until he reached a point near the longitude of the\r\neastern end of Great Slave lake. (Preble.)\r\n\r\nHon. William Christie, ex-member of the Northwest Council, and late\r\nInspecting Factor of the Hudson’s Bay Company, examined before the\r\nSenate committee of 1888 stated that at that date the wood buffalo\r\nroamed over the Athabaska country, chiefly in the woods; but in the\r\nsummer they came down to lick the salt at the salt springs in the valley\r\nof Salt river, which flows into Great Slave lake. He understood that\r\nthese wood buffalo were in small bands of four or five. Mr. Christie\r\nconsidered the wood buffalo to be identical with the plains buffalo.\r\nLong ago the latter species was found as far north as Peace river in\r\ngreat numbers, and the plains Indians, the Sarcees and others, were then\r\nin Peace river country. There is a place called Battle river in Peace\r\nriver valley, where these plains Indians had a tremendous battle, and it\r\nis called Battle river from that circumstance. The plains buffalo were\r\nin that country then in thousands, just the same as they were in the\r\nplains. As they got hunted by the Indians, they moved out, and the\r\nIndians moved out of Peace river country also after this great battle\r\nand went into the plains. The battle in question was fought perhaps one\r\nhundred years previously. A number of the plains buffalo got into the\r\nwoods and bred and remained there and were still living in the woods\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n                         THEY HAD GROWN LARGER\r\n\r\nin some way, but they were just the same as the plains buffalo. Those\r\nwho had killed some of them said they had increased in size in the\r\nwoods, possibly from not being disturbed so much and not having to move\r\nabout as the plains buffalo had to do. The wood buffalo lived in the\r\nwoods, on the grasses that they found. The buffalo does not scrape; he\r\nbreaks the snow with his nose and eats that way. Unless the grass was\r\npretty long he could not get his living there in the winter. About four\r\nor five hundred pounds would be the weight of a wood buffalo. A buffalo\r\ncow in the plains, after being dressed, would weigh about three hundred\r\npounds; one of these wood buffalo would weigh about three hundred and\r\nfifty to four hundred pounds dressed.\r\n\r\nMr. Christie, speaking of the possibility of using the wood buffalo for\r\nhybridization purposes, explained that as far back as 1842, the Hudson’s\r\nBay Company had at Edmonton a herd of buffalo. They began by taking some\r\ncalves, and from these the herd increased until they had some thirty\r\naltogether. These used to herd out with the other cattle and come in\r\nwith them. All at once the buffalo came near Edmonton and this herd went\r\noff with the others. It was the impression then, from their mixing with\r\nthe other cattle, that they would not cross, because there were not any\r\nsigns of it.\r\n\r\nMr. H. J. Moberly, another Chief Factor of the Hudson’s Bay Company,\r\nsubmitted a statement in writing to the Senate committee of 1887 in\r\nwhich he stated that as to wood buffalo there was a band, probably about\r\ntwo hundred, between the Saskatchewan and the Athabaska. They kept on\r\nthe mountains between Lac la Biche and McMurray, and another band,\r\nprobably about three hundred strong, was between Athabaska and Peace\r\nrivers on Thickwood and Birch mountains. A third band, probably seven\r\nhundred strong, was scattered through the mountains between Liard and\r\nPeace rivers, and from Salt river to the foot of Rocky mountains.\r\n\r\n                          A TALE OF SLAUGHTER.\r\n\r\nMr. William Ogilvie, in his report of 1888 wrote:—“The wood buffalo\r\nwhich formerly roamed around all the upper waters, is now nearly a thing\r\nof the past. A few still remain scattered over a wide district. Could\r\nsome means be devised to protect them for some years they would probably\r\nsoon multiply and become a source of food supply and revenue to the\r\nnatives. Mr. McDougall (of the Hudson’s Bay Company), who has for some\r\nyears past been gathering information concerning the number of these\r\nanimals and their locality, has kindly given me the following notes:—In\r\nthe winter of 1887-88, on the head waters of Hay river, which flows into\r\npoint:—“Rumours that the wolves were destroying the buffalo were\r\ncurrent everywhere. Some went so far as to say that these wolves were a\r\nnew and larger race come in from the barren grounds, to prey on them.\r\nSuch rumours were repeated at every point in much the same words,\r\nwithout details. This aroused my suspicions.”\r\n\r\nAt Smith Landing, where the party arrived June 7, the Inspector met\r\nPierre Squirrel, chief of the Chipewyans, and arranged for a meeting of\r\nthe chiefs and hunters who knew the buffalo country near there. At the\r\nmeeting next day, Mr. Jarvis told them he had come to investigate the\r\nbuffalo question, and if necessary, to take steps for the destruction of\r\nthe wolves; that he must go in person to the buffalo country, and if\r\npossible see the buffalo and the wolves. Countless objections were\r\nraised to his plans. The whole country was under from one to five feet\r\nof water, according to one statement. The party would not get a dry spot\r\nto sleep on, according to another. They would be devoured by flies;\r\nwould die of rheumatic fever; it was impossible to find the buffalo;\r\nthey might be hundreds of miles off at that moment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Royal Northwest Mounted Police Barracks at Smith\r\nLanding.]\r\n\r\nOn the thirteenth, Inspector Jarvis left Smith Landing and after a long\r\nday’s march in a west-southwest direction reached Salt river. None of\r\nthe swamps so much talked of proved very serious, and it was evident\r\nthat all were dry in late summer. At one point only was a true bog seen\r\nand it extended for only half a mile. The following day, following the\r\ncourse of Salt river downward, the first buffalo were sighted. Inspector\r\nJarvis writes in his report:—“The trails, wallows and chips of buffalo\r\nbecame noticeable, but as they were old we gave them only passing note.\r\nBut when two perfectly fresh ones appeared, we dismounted to follow them\r\non foot. I took charge of the horses as the flies were very thick. Great\r\nSlave lake, and west of Battle river, a tributary of the Peace, the\r\nIndians saw three bands containing seventeen, ten, and four,\r\nrespectively; they killed five, but Mr. McDougall did not ascertain\r\nwhether or not these were in addition to the above numbers. The same\r\nwinter three bands were seen between Salt river and Peace point on Peace\r\nriver, numbering fifty, twenty-five, and about twenty-five,\r\nrespectively. None of these are reported to have been killed. During the\r\nwinter of 1886-87, between the north end of Birch and the south end of\r\nThickwood mountains, distant about one day or thirty miles from McMurray\r\non Athabaska river, one band of about thirteen was seen. Since then five\r\nof this band have been killed. Below Red river, a tributary of the\r\nAthabaska, and between Birch mountains and Athabaska river, and ranging\r\ndown to Poplar point on the Athabaska, another band said to contain\r\nabout twenty was seen. Altogether we have only about one hundred and\r\neighty head of wood buffalo in this vast extent of territory. The\r\npaucity of their number is, to some extent, a protection to them. If\r\nthey escape epidemics and such a winter as almost exterminated them on\r\nthe upper Peace some years ago, they may possibly increase. Whenever the\r\nIndians come across a band they try to exterminate them whether they\r\nneed them for food or not. They try to drive them into a bog, if one be\r\nconvenient, and, if they succeed in this their object is soon\r\naccomplished, for the poor brutes mire in the bog and are quickly\r\nkilled. The Indian feels, after accomplishing a feat of this kind, as if\r\nhe had won a battle, and never thinks of a reduction in his food\r\nsupply.”\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Ogilvie’s report was penned; and partly as a result of it,\r\nsteps have been taken to protect the wood buffalo, and for years back,\r\nthe few members of the gallant Northwest Mounted Police in Athabaska\r\ncountry have devoted considerable energy to enforcing the law which\r\nprohibits the hunting of the buffalo. The most authentic portion of the\r\nmore recent information we have as to the present extent and condition\r\nof the herds of wood buffalo is obtained from the reports of officers\r\nand non-commissioned officers of the distinguished force mentioned.\r\n\r\n                   PRESENT CONDITION OF WOOD BUFFALO.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 Inspector A. M. Jarvis, C.M.G., was specially despatched from\r\nheadquarters at Regina to the Athabaska country[17] to ascertain the\r\nexisting numbers and condition of the wood buffalo and to recommend\r\nmeans for their protection.\r\n\r\nInspector Jarvis, accompanied by the well known naturalist, Mr. E.\r\nThompson Seton, left McMurray for the north on June 29. He wrote in his\r\nreport at this and sent Mr. Seton on with his camera. Beaulieu stalked\r\nthem exactly as he would a moose, and in about an hour led Mr. Seton to\r\nan open glade where in plain view was\r\n\r\n                      A HERD OF THIRTEEN BUFFALO,\r\n\r\ntwo big bulls, one calf of this year, and the rest cows and yearlings.\r\nTheir photograph was taken three times at sixty yards, before they\r\nbecame alarmed and ran off.\r\n\r\n“Bear tracks abound everywhere, and that night Beaulieu shot an old bear\r\nand two cubs within fifty yards of our camp.”\r\n\r\nThe Inspector reports as follows as to the next day’s\r\noperations:—“Beaulieu and myself started out at 6:45 a.m. and travelled\r\naround the west side of Salt mountain until 10:40 p.m., following fresh\r\ntracks of two buffalo, until we came upon fresh tracks of what appeared\r\nto be a large herd. We tied our horses in the woods and followed along\r\nfor about a mile through wet, swampy ground, until we came in sight of a\r\nbunch, all of which were lying down except three large bulls. They were\r\non a large salt lick. We crawled up to within (which we afterwards\r\nmeasured) fifty paces of them, through the brush. I took out my glasses\r\nbut owing to our position, could not get a correct count of them. After\r\nresting for a little while we both walked into the open. I took out my\r\npocket book and wrote down as follows:—‘Four big bulls, one yearling,\r\nfour little calves, three two-year-olds, and eight cows.’ They then saw\r\nus and got up one by one and stared at us, showing how easily they can\r\nbe approached and killed. Beaulieu then shouted and they galloped into\r\nthe woods. The bulls were magnificent looking animals. They had not yet\r\nshed all their winter coat, but the cows were sleek and fine looking.\r\nBefore going into the open, Beaulieu, who had his rifle along, said,\r\n‘Mon Dieu, major; let me kill him one cow.’ I explained to him that we\r\nwould be fined five hundred dollars and that I would lose my position.\r\nHe then said, ‘Let me kill him one for the Government.’ But I would not\r\npermit it. We returned to the camp where we had left Mr. Seton and that\r\nevening moved our camp to a spot where we thought these animals might\r\npass. But we saw no more of them. As we\r\n\r\n                HAD SEEN THIRTY-THREE OF THESE ANIMALS,\r\n\r\nand the fresh tracks of ten or twelve more, possibly bulls, in the\r\nwoods, we concluded that we had seen all the buffalo in this particular\r\ndistrict. And as there was no time to go to Peace point and rapid de\r\nBeaulieu, and keep our word with the guide, I decided to return, to go\r\nto Fort Smith and arrange if possible to see the band reported to be in\r\nthe Caribou mountains, near Hay river. We looked everywhere for buffalo\r\nbones, but found only four very old skeletons, with nothing to tell how\r\nthey had been killed. At all drinking places, muddy lakes, marshes and\r\nsalt licks, we looked particularly for tracks of wolves and found very\r\nfew. I got a glimpse of one small wolf, or possibly coyote, in the\r\nwoods, and heard one coyote calling, just as we were leaving the\r\nmountain, he having smelt the bear we had killed. We found the skull of\r\none wolf killed years ago, but I am forced to conclude that wolves are\r\nscarce here, and I found ample justification for my suspicion that the\r\nconstant cry of ‘wolf’ is a mere ruse to divert attention from the\r\ntwo-legged depredators, who are really doing the mischief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Looking across Slave river from Fort Smith.]\r\n\r\n“Other game abounded. Bear tracks were seen on every side. Caribou are\r\nsaid to be plentiful in winter. Moose are common. I saw one without\r\ndoing any hunting. This is important for the buffalo, as several well\r\nknown hunters claim this region as their hunting and trapping grounds.\r\nThey go in ostensibly to kill moose and come out abundantly supplied\r\nwith pemmican, but bring out very few moose skins. I am informed by the\r\ntraders here, that a few years ago these hunters begged sale for moose\r\nskins, but of late years scarcely any have been brought out. This is\r\nvery suspicious, to say the least of it. These men did all they could to\r\nprevent my going in, and I consider it no longer doubtful what is\r\ndestroying the buffalo.\r\n\r\n“The following morning the guide announced that his time was nearly up\r\nand he wanted to return to Smith Landing, which we did, arriving there\r\nat 4 p.m. on the afternoon of June 16. It will be seen by the map, that\r\nwe barely entered the buffalo country, so were fortunate in seeing so\r\nmany head.\r\n\r\n“In case it were desired to capture some calves for the purpose of\r\ninfusing fresh blood into other national herds, it could, I think, be\r\neasily done, as in the early summer, when the calves are young, they\r\ncould be run down and roped. A fresh cow could be taken out from Smith\r\nLanding or some other point, calves captured, and weaned on to the cow.\r\nI consider this feasible.\r\n\r\n“To sum up I conclude:—\r\n\r\n“(a) That it is impossible for me or any one else in this country to\r\ngive you an intelligent report as to the numbers of the buffalo, without\r\nfirst making a thorough patrol of the country, which would take from two\r\nto three months with a complete pack outfit.\r\n\r\n“(b) That the buffalo are in danger of extermination not by wolves, but\r\nby poachers;\r\n\r\n“(c) These poachers are all known and live at the village of Smith\r\nLanding in the summer time;\r\n\r\n“(d) They could easily be controlled by a local police patrol;\r\n\r\n“(e) Without some protection the buffalo will not last five years\r\nlonger. Therefore I strongly recommend, as I did some ten years ago,\r\nthat, if it is the wish of the Government to protect the buffalo,\r\nresident guardians be placed on the grounds.”\r\n\r\n                       WOLVES NOT THE DESTROYERS.\r\n\r\nInspector Jarvis started from Fort Smith for his second trip on June 24.\r\nThe party proceeded in a westerly direction for about nine miles through\r\na level, dry country, covered with jackpine and poplar, following nearly\r\nthe course of Slave river to Gravel point, where they turned\r\nsouthwesterly to Salt river, which they reached in another nine miles.\r\nThe party proceeded as far west as Little Buffalo river which flows into\r\nGreat Slave lake west of Slave river, but saw no signs of buffalo beyond\r\nsome old trails and wallows.\r\n\r\nReporting on this trip Major Jarvis wrote:—“Although we found no fresh\r\nbuffalo signs, we learned a great deal about the range and were glad to\r\nhear that the main herd is the one we expect to reach by Canoe river. We\r\nsaw no signs of wolves, not even a trail, and I am confirmed in my\r\nsuspicion that the wolves are not the destroyers of the buffalo. In\r\nconclusion I would point out that the range of the buffalo herds is very\r\nlimited; that it has certain natural boundaries; that the buffalo do not\r\nattempt to leave this area; that it is removed from any village or\r\npermanent habitation; and that, finally, it would be an efficient and\r\neasy measure of protection if the whole area in question were at once\r\nturned into a National Park. Animal life was not abundant. We saw no big\r\ngame whatever, and but few signs of moose or bear. Mr. Preble was\r\nfortunate to find the nest and eggs of a very rare bird, the Bohemian\r\nWaxwing, but we saw no game birds in the woods, and only a few ducks on\r\nthe ponds.”\r\n\r\n                      THE LITTLE BUFFALO COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nMajor Jarvis, accompanied by Mr. Thompson Seton and Mr. E. A. Preble,\r\nnaturalists, made a third trip by canoe into the buffalo country from a\r\npoint on Slave river below Fort Smith. A water and portage route of five\r\nand a half miles took them to the Little Buffalo, down which they\r\npaddled to its mouth. On this trip fresh signs of buffalo were seen, but\r\nno buffalo.\r\n\r\nThe Inspector writes in his report of this trip:—“We saw three bear,\r\nthree beaver, and some duck along this part of the river, and all along\r\nwe saw numerous signs, and fresh, of beaver, rat and mink. We also saw\r\nan exposure of limestone on the left bank during the afternoon. We found\r\nthe river abounding with jackfish, Mr. Preble catching four with a troll\r\nin a very short time. During the night Buffalo river seemed to be alive\r\nwith mink swimming forwards and backwards across it.”\r\n\r\nAs a result of Major Jarvis’s report more stringent regulations\r\nregarding the protection of the buffalo were put into force. A system of\r\noccasional patrols by selected non-commissioned officers and men of the\r\nRoyal Northwest Mounted Police into the buffalo country was inaugurated,\r\nand some resident hunters were engaged as special constables.\r\n\r\n                        A BAND OF SEVENTY-FIVE.\r\n\r\nCorporal Mellor, Royal Northwest Mounted Police, on a patrol into the\r\nbuffalo country southwest of Smith Landing in 1909, found buffalo tracks\r\nvery numerous at Beaver lake and also on the “Big Salt prairie” at Hay\r\nlake and about Peace point. In the district last named Corporal Mellor\r\nwas able to get within five yards of a band of about seventy-five\r\nbuffalo, and obtained a good look at them. He says in his\r\nreport:—“Owing to the fact that many of them were hidden from view in\r\nthe bush, I was unable to count them correctly. Those nearest to view\r\nwere nine large bulls, all splendid animals and rolling fat. I saw only\r\nfour calves in the band, although there may have been more in the bush,\r\nbut the guide, after examining the tracks, told me that there were no\r\nmore. We tried to get around to see them all, but something alarmed them\r\nand off they went. This band was evidently composed of the different\r\nsmall bands whose tracks we had been following at times.”\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1910 Sergeant Mellor, accompanied by Constable Johnson,\r\nascended Big Buffalo river from Sulphur point on Great Slave lake to\r\nBuffalo lake. The main object was to determine as far as possible the\r\nnorthern boundary of the wood bison habitat. As a result of his\r\nexploration Sergeant Mellor concludes that the wood bison never range as\r\nfar as Buffalo lake, nor across the Caribou hills, neither do they reach\r\nGreat Slave lake at any point; on the other hand, they come close to\r\nSlave river from a point about fifty miles below Fort Smith right up to\r\nPeace river, and also reach Peace river, at any rate, as far as Jackfish\r\nriver. Their habitat would therefore appear, he says, to be bounded on\r\nthe west by Caribou mountains, on the south by Peace river, on the east\r\nby Slave river, and on the north by an imaginary line drawn from Caribou\r\nmountains on the west to Slave river on the east, touching the latter at\r\nabout Point Ennuyeuse, and the former about fifty miles south of Buffalo\r\nlake. The buffalo have, as far as he could make out from careful\r\ninquiry, never been seen for many years north of these two points.\r\n\r\n                          A TREMENDOUS ANIMAL.\r\n\r\nMr. H. A. Conroy of the Indian Department, in his evidence before the\r\nSenate committee of 1907, said that he believed that there were then\r\napproximately three hundred and fifty wood buffalo still roaming wild at\r\nthat date. He obtained a specimen for the Department of Agriculture in\r\n1906 to be mounted. The Indians got it for him. This herd are the only\r\nwild buffalo on the continent, he believed. They are very large, much\r\nlarger than the plains buffalo. One old Indian told the witness that\r\nyears ago they found a herd of buffalo between Liard and Hay rivers, and\r\none time they got a herd of them at Fort Providence, and they\r\nslaughtered all that were in there. There had since been a close season\r\nfor buffalo for a good many years. The skin of the buffalo that the\r\nwitness procured for the department was a tremendous size, and he would\r\nsay that the animal must have weighed fourteen or fifteen hundred\r\npounds. Mr. Conroy in his evidence said:—“You do not require to enforce\r\nthe law to protect the buffalo. The Indians will not kill them. They\r\nwant to preserve them as much as any one else. They are the Wood Cree\r\nIndians in the country north, as far as the 60th parallel, and the\r\nChipewyans north of latitude 60 degrees, until you come to the Aleutians\r\nor Esquimaux. The Indians think if the buffalo are gone they will have\r\nnothing left. The Wood Crees are benefiting by the errors of the Indians\r\nsouth of the Saskatchewan. They know that the buffalo are all gone,\r\nsouth of them, and they want to protect the wood buffalo.”\r\n\r\nSergeant R. W. Macleod, Royal Northwest Mounted Police, in the report of\r\nhis long patrol across country in December 1910 from Fort Vermilion to\r\nthe mouth of Hay river on Great Slave lake, corroborates the final\r\nstatement of Mr. Conroy. The sergeant states:—“The Indians I met were\r\nfamiliar with the regulations for the protection of the buffalo and\r\nprotested strongly against a white man being permitted to kill any. The\r\nIndians told me the extreme western range of the buffalo is thirty-five\r\nor forty miles east of Buffalo lake, and there is certainly no feed for\r\nthem in any part of the country I passed over.”\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1911 the special supervision of the wood buffalo\r\nwas taken out of the hands of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police, and\r\ntransferred to a government agent who is stationed at Smith Landing.\r\n\r\n                          OTHER GAME AND FISH.\r\n\r\nSome interesting evidence as to the general fish and game resources of\r\nthe whole north, and more particularly northern Alberta, was submitted\r\nin writing to the Senate committee of 1887 by Mr. H. J. Moberly, a chief\r\ntrader in the Hudson’s Bay Company’s service. This gentleman, through\r\nlong residence and frequent travels therein, was quite familiar with\r\nthis country. According to his statement lake trout is found in almost\r\nall the large lakes all over the country, and river trout in Athabaska\r\nand Peace rivers and other streams close to Rocky mountains. Speckled\r\ntrout and mountain trout are found in waters on the east and west slope\r\nof Rocky mountains; whitefish, all over the country from the\r\nSaskatchewan north, in lakes and most rivers; pickerel, in most lakes;\r\njackfish or pike in most lakes; suckers, in all waters; gold-eye,\r\nAthabaska river, Peace river and their tributaries; a peculiar kind of\r\nsalmon (doubtless the inconnu), in Mackenzie river as far up as Salt\r\nriver rapids, above Great Slave lake.\r\n\r\nDucks are found all over the country and geese and swans along the\r\nAthabaska, the Peace, and the Mackenzie and the shores of Hudson bay;\r\ncranes, along the Athabaska, the Peace and the Mackenzie; prairie\r\nchickens, Athabaska and Peace river countries; ruffled grouse and spruce\r\npartridge all over the Northwest Territories; ptarmigan, Athabaska,\r\nPeace river, Hudson bay; plover and snipe, all over the Northwest\r\nTerritories.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Moberly, moose run all over the wooded country north of\r\nthe prairies and east of Rocky mountains.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of other game and fur animals in far northwestern\r\nCanada was given by Mr. Moberly as follows:—Reindeer (cariboo), large,\r\nall over the wood countries from Saskatchewan, to the barren grounds in\r\nthe north; reindeer, small, all over the barren grounds in the north,\r\nand come south in winter as far as Lac la Brochet, Athabaska lake and\r\nPeace river, close to Rocky mountains; red deer, Athabaska and Peace\r\nriver valleys; black tail deer, jumping deer and chevreux, same country\r\nas the red deer; black and brown bears, all over the wooded country and\r\nRocky mountains; grizzly bears, Rocky mountains, valley of the Peace,\r\nAthabaska, Liard, and Fraser, but seldom farther than two hundred and\r\nfifty miles from the foot of the Rockies; beaver, Athabaska, Peace\r\nriver, and in fact all over the wooded country,\r\n\r\n                            BACK’S GRAYLING.\r\n\r\nProfessor John Macoun, before the Senate committee of 1888, said he had\r\ncaught Back’s grayling in the tributaries of Peace river, in Rocky\r\nmountains. It is both an Arctic and a mountain fish, and delights in\r\nclear water. It is very gamesome and takes all kinds of bait. When it\r\ntook the bait it would jump clear out of the water, many times a couple\r\nof feet or so, and of course, the beautiful colours (more beautiful than\r\nthose of the mackerel even), glistening in the sun, made the anglers\r\nthrill with excitement. They are a white fleshed fish, and not anything\r\nlike as hard as the trout.\r\n\r\nWriting of the immense quantities of fish caught in Lake Athabaska, Mr.\r\nWm. Ogilvie states in his report:—“At Chipewyan, the Hudson’s Bay\r\nCompany required, in the fall of 1888, thirty-six thousand fish for the\r\nuse of the post; the Roman Catholic mission, twelve thousand; and the\r\nrest of the population at least thirty thousand more. Most of these were\r\ncaught in three weeks, while I was there. Sometimes they are numerous in\r\none place and sometimes in another, so that long journeys are often\r\nnecessary from the place where they are caught to the place where they\r\nare to be used. This necessitates a large number of dogs to haul them\r\nhome, which is a very poor method, though it is the only one in use. To\r\novercome this inconvenience, Mr. McDougall, at Chipewyan, has built an\r\nice-boat, but has so far met with indifferent success, as the ice has\r\nbeen unusually rough during both of the last two falls.”\r\n\r\nAs to the fish and game in the district explored by him in 1909, Mr.\r\nFrank Crean reports that the principal fish to be found in the north is\r\nthe whitefish. The chief use made at present of this valuable fish is\r\nfor dog feed, large numbers being caught for this purpose in the annual\r\n“fall fisheries,” as they are termed. Beside the whitefish, the jackfish\r\nis also found in most of the lakes, and indeed in that country which\r\nlies to the west of the height of land and on the watershed of Athabaska\r\nriver this is the principal fish. Although extremely good food in these\r\ncold northern waters they are, of course, not to be compared with the\r\nwhitefish. The perch, or as the natives sometimes call them, the doré,\r\nare found in most of the rivers and lakes. During the summer months they\r\nform the staple diet, as the whitefish apparently go into the deep holes\r\nin the lakes and are not caught by the natives, who rarely fish in deep\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Roman Catholic Mission at Chipewyan.]\r\n\r\nDescribing an ascent by him of Big Buffalo river, in 1909 Sergeant\r\nMellor states:—“The cutbanks are riddled with sulphur springs (the\r\nodour of which overhangs the whole river), interspersed in peculiarly\r\nintimate proximity with streams of beautifully fresh water. The river\r\nwas literally alive with ‘coneys,’ a species of fish somewhat resembling\r\na salmon, and which attains a large size; the name is a corruption of\r\nthe French name for the fish ‘poisson inconnu,’—‘the unknown fish.’\r\nThey were apparently ascending the river for spawning purposes; it was\r\nquite unnecessary to use a net or line to catch them, as it was a simple\r\nmatter to throw them on land with a paddle or stick. For the next twenty\r\nmiles the river, while still running with great velocity, has not so\r\nmany rapids to encounter, and the going is considerably better. The\r\nbanks are lower, and in many places were clothed in berry bushes of all\r\nkinds, and simply riddled with bear tracks. We did not have the good\r\nfortune to kill one of these latter, although we saw them several\r\ntimes.”\r\n\r\n                            A MOOSE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nSergeant R. W. Macleod, Royal Northwest Mounted Police, in a report of a\r\npatrol in 1909 from Fort Vermilion to Hay river, states that while\r\ndescending Hay river on January 27 one of his men shot a two-year old\r\nbull moose about one hundred yards from the river bank. After the patrol\r\ngot almost one hundred miles down the river from the Horse track they\r\nsaw moose tracks all the way as far as within twenty miles of Great\r\nSlave lake, and they saw three moose, but did not shoot, as they did not\r\nneed the meat. They did not see a snow-shoe track in the whole distance\r\nof two hundred and thirty-eight miles, which accounts for the moose\r\nbeing so plentiful. One fox track was all the indication of fur to be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nBetween December 2 and 24, 1910, Sergeant Macleod made a patrol from\r\nFort Vermilion across country to the post at the mouth of Hay river on\r\nGreat Slave lake, a distance of five hundred miles. Sergeant Macleod\r\ntook advantage of some Indians travelling through to make the trip,\r\nwhich was a very hard one, particularly on the dogs, as the snow was\r\ndeep. No white man is known to have made this journey before, and it was\r\ntwenty years since Indians had attempted it. The country is quite\r\nunexplored. The width of Cariboo mountains is about one hundred miles\r\nand the country is mainly moss-covered muskeg and lakes. Sergeant\r\nMacleod made enquiries regarding a large unmapped lake he saw the\r\nprevious year and found that it is called Fish lake by the Indians. It\r\nis as large as Lesser Slave lake and is in Cariboo mountains. This is\r\nbelieved to be the lake which a Mr. Radford, an American naturalist,\r\nclaimed he discovered and reported to the Department of the Interior as\r\nLady Grey lake.\r\n\r\nSergeant Macleod reported that all the lakes he passed during this long\r\ntrip seemed to be deep for their size, and in the sergeant’s opinion\r\nthey no doubt contain whitefish and lake trout. In Fish lake there is\r\ngood fishing. There were three half-breed families belonging to Fort\r\nVermilion and two Chipewyan Indian families living on Deer Mountain\r\ncreek four miles southeast of Buffalo lake, it being a good place for\r\nfall fishing. Caribou were plentiful on the mountain. Moose were\r\nplentiful on the north side, and there were considerable fur tracks on\r\nthe north side of the mountain. Sergeant Macleod’s party “tracked” four\r\nwolves.\r\n\r\nThe latest data available as to fish and game in the region immediately\r\nunder discussion appear in the annual report for 1911 of Superintendent\r\nG. E. Sanders, D.S.O., commanding “N” Division, Royal Northwest Mounted\r\nPolice, with headquarters at Athabaska. In his report Superintendent\r\nSanders writes:—“The fur catch during the past season has improved;\r\nlynx were plentiful in the far north; they have been very scarce for\r\nsome years and are now reappearing with the rabbits. The value of the\r\nfur which passed through Athabaska this year on its way out of the\r\ncountry is estimated at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Moose\r\nwere scarce in some parts where they are generally plentiful and\r\nappeared in large numbers at points where they are not usually seen;\r\nthis is accounted for by the wolves moving them about. Wolves are\r\nreported thick in all directions and at Peace River Landing a small pack\r\nchased a moose through the settlement. Chicken and partridge are\r\nnumerous in the southern portion of the district. This year the chief\r\ngame guardian of the provincial government has notified that the close\r\nseason for beaver will remain in force. Hitherto it has been the custom\r\nto open the season during the winter for a short time. The effort to\r\npreserve the beaver by having a close season in this country fails\r\nentirely, and I would repeat what I said last year in regard to this\r\nsubject about which I made careful inquiries. ‘I am strongly of opinion\r\nthere should be an open season for beaver. I found during my travels\r\nthat Indians kill more beaver when there is no open season than when\r\nthere is. When they do not kill for the fur, and there is no reason in\r\ntheir minds to preserve the animals, they exterminate whole families for\r\nfood, whereas if they have an open season, and the fur is thereby more\r\nvaluable, they are careful not to destroy certain colonies, but leave\r\nsome to breed. They kill only when the fur is prime. The majority of the\r\nhunters and trappers whom I consulted agreed that between October 15 and\r\nDecember 15 would be the most suitable time for an open season.’”\r\n\r\nCorporal S. G. Clay, Royal Northwest Mounted Police, made a patrol\r\nthrough Grande prairie country in August, 1911, and in his report\r\nstates:—“Indians in this locality are in fairly good shape, moose and\r\nbear being plentiful, and consequently there has been practically no\r\ndestitution amongst the Indians.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[17] A considerable portion of the wood buffalo range lies immediately\r\nbeyond the northern boundary of Alberta and is consequently within the\r\nlimits of the region particularly treated of in the later chapters\r\nespecially devoted to the “Mackenzie country.” On reference to the map\r\n(and the map must necessarily be consulted frequently by the reader of\r\nthese pages) it will be noticed, also, that much of the data quoted here\r\nreally refers to those sections of the wood buffalo range within what is\r\narbitrarily defined in this volume as the Mackenzie country; but as the\r\nsouthern part of the range is in northern Alberta, and as the wood\r\nbuffalo, probably on account of its scientific designation, is\r\nassociated in most people’s minds with the Athabaska region, it was\r\nconsidered advisable to treat the question of the wood buffalo, as a\r\nwhole, in the present chapter. E. J. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MACKENZIE RIVER REGION]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE MACKENZIE RIVER REGION.\r\n\r\n                Topography, Agriculture and Arable Land.\r\n\r\n   Mackenzie River a King of Northern Waters.—Over Three Thousand\r\n     Miles of Waterway.—Domestic Cattle have Succeeded.—Barley\r\n     Always Ripens at Fort Simpson.—Potatoes and Other Vegetables\r\n     have for Many Years Been Grown at Fort Good Hope, a few Miles\r\n     from the Arctic Circle.—Wheat and Barley Grown at Liard for\r\n     Many Years.—Interesting Comparison With the Russian Province of\r\n     Tobolsk.—A Large Town as Far North as Fort Wrigley.—Why Better\r\n     Results in Grain Growing May be Expected in the Future.\r\n\r\nNorthern Alberta, including the Athabaska and Peace countries treated of\r\nin the chapters immediately preceding, is generally considered, and\r\nproperly, as forming part of the Great Mackenzie Basin, and that it has\r\nbeen in this volume considered as separate from the immense region on\r\nboth sides of the Mackenzie, surrounding Great Slave lake, and on both\r\nsides of Slave river from Fort Smith to its mouth at the lake in\r\nquestion, is due to the purpose, previously expressed, of treating as\r\nseparate geographical units regions possessing particular\r\ncharacteristics either of location, soil, climate or natural resources.\r\n\r\nThe region discussed in the present and immediately succeeding chapters\r\nas “The Mackenzie River Region” includes the country north of the\r\nAlberta and British Columbia boundary line (the 60th parallel of north\r\nlatitude) extending as far north as Beaufort sea. To the westward it is\r\nbounded by the Yukon territory boundary line, and to the eastward by the\r\nheight of land east of Slave river, the height of land between the\r\nvalley of Coppermine river and the lake and river system extending from\r\nthe north arm of Great Slave lake to Great Bear lake, and a line in\r\nprolongation thereof northward to the sea.\r\n\r\nThere might be some question as to the advisability of considering the\r\ncountry north, south and east of Great Bear lake as part of the country\r\nlying more immediately adjacent to the great river of the north. It is\r\ntrue that the slight knowledge of the country north, south and\r\nimmediately east of Great Bear lake tends to show that it is a region\r\nfar less inviting than the immediate valley of the Mackenzie, and that\r\nit practically forms part of the so-called “Barren Lands” which extend\r\nas far eastward as Hudson bay. But this unfavourable evidence is not\r\nquite conclusive, and after all, the whole of the country within the\r\nlimits decided upon is in the Mackenzie watershed, and has been\r\nconsidered in a broad sense as part of the Mackenzie region by the\r\nexplorers, missionaries, traders, and travellers who have written of the\r\ncountry. So the adoption of the limits decided upon should simplify the\r\ngeographical situation for the reader, and that is an important thing in\r\nconsidering a territory so vast as that immediately under review.\r\n\r\n                       A KING OF NORTHERN WATERS.\r\n\r\nMackenzie river is one of the longest and broadest streams in the world.\r\nAccording to Mr. R. G. McConnell, of the Geological Survey, one of the\r\nfirst to attempt a scientific survey of the river, the Mackenzie “drains\r\nan area of six hundred and seventy-seven thousand, four hundred square\r\nmiles, and has an approximate discharge at a medium stage of the water,\r\naccording to some rough measurements made by the writer, of five hundred\r\nthousand cubic feet per second. Its basin is traversed for nearly one\r\nthousand three hundred miles by Rocky mountains, and the Mackenzie is\r\nprobably unique among the rivers of the world in the fact of having a\r\nlarge proportion of its basin situated on the farther side of a great\r\nmountain chain. Two of its principal tributaries, Liard and Peace\r\nrivers, pierce Rocky mountains and drain large areas beyond, while the\r\nthird, the Athabaska, originates in the heart of the same range, and is\r\nconfined entirely to the eastern slope. The country from which the\r\nMackenzie draws its supplies is of the most varied description and\r\nincludes part of the broken plateau region west of Rocky mountains,\r\nRocky mountains themselves through fifteen degrees of latitude, the\r\nnorthern part of the prairie district and the wooded and moss-covered\r\ncountry which succeeds it towards Arctic ocean, while tribute is also\r\ndrawn from a wide belt of rough Laurentian country on the east, and from\r\nportion of the “Barren Lands.” From Great Slave lake to the sea the\r\nMackenzie is an imposing stream, averaging about a mile in width with\r\noccasional expansions for long distances to twice this size. It is\r\ncharacterized by the comparative purity of its water, by its long\r\nstraight reaches and by the absence of sudden bends. Its valley, usually\r\nshallow, follows closely all the sinuosities of the stream without the\r\nintervention of large flats. Clusters of islands obstruct its channel in\r\na number of places, and are met with at intervals all the way down,\r\nwhile ranges of lofty mountains run parallel with it for part of its\r\ncourse, and form a fitting background to this king of northern waters.”\r\n\r\n                    SILENT SWEEP OF A MIGHTY RIVER.\r\n\r\n“Opposite Fort Simpson,” according to Mr. McConnell, “the main channel\r\nof the Mackenzie is almost exactly a mile wide, and it maintains and\r\noften exceeds this width for many miles below. Its course, as far as the\r\nGreat Bend, a distance of seventy miles, is north-northwest, and its\r\ncurrent in average stages of the water has a velocity of about four\r\nmiles an hour. The banks of the valley appear low owing to the great\r\nsize of the river, but in reality have often a height of two hundred\r\nfeet or over. The appearance of this part of the Mackenzie and of the\r\nunending spruce forests which border it is monotonous and uninteresting,\r\nand is only relieved by the majesty inseparable from the silent sweep of\r\na river of its magnitude.”\r\n\r\nSlave river, which discharges the water of Lake Athabaska and Peace\r\nriver into Great Slave lake, is practically an upper reach of the\r\nMackenzie, its course being in the same general direction but the name\r\n“Mackenzie” is given only to that long stretch of navigable water from\r\nGreat Slave lake to the sea.\r\n\r\nAs Mackenzie river itself is the outstanding geographical feature of the\r\ncountry, as it is the main channel of communication, and as all the\r\nsettlements are situated upon its banks or those of its tributaries, a\r\ntable of distances along this gigantic waterway may prove to be a useful\r\nguide to those readers of these pages, who are not familiar with the\r\ngeography of the country. The table is compiled from the report by Wm.\r\nOgilvie, D.L.S., of his survey, and the figures cover the route from\r\nFort Smith, on Slave river, practically on the Alberta boundary line, to\r\nFort McPherson on the delta of the Mackenzie:—\r\n\r\n                                                       MILES.\r\n\r\n            Fort Smith                                      0\r\n            Fort Resolution                             190·5\r\n            Buffalo creek                               202·5\r\n            Buffalo river                               249·5\r\n            Hay river                                   276·5\r\n            Great Slave lake                            311·5\r\n            Fort Providence (lat. 61·4°)                357·5\r\n            Little lake                                 381·5\r\n            Yellowknife river                           417·9\r\n            Head of Line                                444·0\r\n            Fort Simpson (lat. 61·8°)                   515·0\r\n            Nahanni river                               590·2\r\n            Willow lake river                           606·5\r\n            River between Two Mountains                 645·5\r\n            Fort Wrigley (lat. 63°)                     649·0\r\n            Le Vieux Grand Lac river                    723·0\r\n            Gravel river                                764·2\r\n            Fort Norman (lat. about 65°)                829·3\r\n            Great Bear river                            829·5\r\n            Carcajou river                              945·5\r\n            Mountain river                              950·2\r\n            Sans Sault rapids                           950·8\r\n            Beaver river                                987·8\r\n            Ramparts                                    989·9\r\n            Fort Good Hope (lat. 66·16°)                998·8\r\n            Hare Indian river                          1001·1\r\n            Loon river                                 1022·7\r\n            Large river entering on east side,\r\n                name unknown                           1153·0\r\n            Red river                                  1213·4\r\n            Delta of Mackenzie                         1241·4\r\n            Fort McPherson (lat. 67·26°)               1273·5\r\n\r\nThe Dominion census of 1911 gives us the following figures of the\r\npopulation of these places, and of one or two other posts which will be\r\nreferred to later:—Fort Good Hope, 434; Fort Liard, 136; Fort\r\nMcPherson, 387; Fort Norman, 315; Fort Providence, 473; Fort Rea, 774;\r\nFort Resolution, 766; Fort Simpson, 375; Fort Smith, 50; Fort Wrigley,\r\n79; Hay river, 146.\r\n\r\nThese figures do not represent only the local population at the posts,\r\nbut in addition the inhabitants, white and red, of the surrounding\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\n                         MACKENZIE NAVIGATION.\r\n\r\nFor many years the Hudson’s Bay Company have maintained steam\r\ncommunication on the Mackenzie from Fort Smith to Fort McPherson by\r\nmeans of steamers. The pioneer steamer “Wrigley” is one of the\r\nhistorical associations of the country. According to Mr. William\r\nOgilvie, the “Wrigley’s” log shows the following average between Fort\r\nSmith, the most southerly part of her run, and Fort McPherson, the most\r\nnortherly, the distance between these points being about one thousand\r\ntwo hundred and seventy miles. From Fort Smith to Fort Resolution,\r\nnearly all on Great Slave river, average running time, about eighteen\r\nhours; between Resolution and Providence about seventeen hours, of which\r\ntwelve and a half are in Great Slave lake; between Providence and\r\nSimpson about fourteen hours; Simpson to Wrigley about ten and a half;\r\nWrigley to Norman, about fourteen hours; Norman to Good Hope, about\r\nthirteen hours; Good Hope to McPherson, about twenty-four and a half\r\nhours. The total running time is one hundred and twenty-three and\r\none-half hours, somewhat over ten and a quarter miles an hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Typical “Husky” dog.]\r\n\r\nOn “up” runs the following averages have been made:—McPherson to Good\r\nHope, forty hours; Good Hope to Norman, thirty-four hours, Norman to\r\nWrigley, thirty-nine hours; Wrigley to Simpson; nineteen hours; Simpson\r\nto Providence, about twenty-eight hours; Providence to Fort Rae, not\r\ncertain, appears to be about thirteen hours; Providence to Resolution,\r\nabout twenty hours; Resolution to Smith, about thirty-five hours;\r\nResolution to Rae, about fifteen hours and a return about the same, as\r\nit is all lake water. The duration of these runs varied somewhat by the\r\nforce and direction of the wind. The total running from McPherson to\r\nSmith as shown above is two hundred and fifteen and one-half hours,\r\nwhich give a rate of 5·9 miles per hour. The mean of the up and down\r\ntimes is a fraction over eight miles an hour, which is said to be her\r\nnormal speed.\r\n\r\n                       A LONG NAVIGABLE STRETCH.\r\n\r\nMr. Ogilvie, in his report, points out:—“Excepting a short distance at\r\nthe head of Mackenzie river, where it is doubtful, it is certain that\r\nvessels drawing at least seven or eight feet of water can navigate from\r\nthe delta of the Mackenzie to the rapids on Great Slave river, a\r\ndistance of one thousand two hundred and seventy-three miles. If\r\nMackenzie delta also allows that draught, we have about one thousand\r\nthree hundred and forty miles of navigable water from the rapids to\r\nArctic ocean.”\r\n\r\n“Wherever possible the width of the river was determined by\r\ntriangulation. Between the narrows and Fort Good Hope it is never less\r\nthan a mile wide and is often more than two, even reaching three miles\r\nat some points.\r\n\r\n“Since I followed the shore, I cannot speak of the depth of water from\r\npersonal observation. Captain Bell, of the Hudson’s Bay Company’s\r\nsteamer ‘Wrigley,’ informed me that the shallowest water found by him in\r\nany part of the river, in what he considered the channel, was eleven\r\nfeet. But as, when I saw him, he had made only two trips on the lower\r\nriver, he could not speak very definitely as to its depth. Sir Alexander\r\nMackenzie, who discovered the river and descended to its mouth in July,\r\n1789, had a lead line with which to make soundings; but in the swift\r\ncurrent a short distance above Fort Simpson his lead caught in the\r\nbottom, the line broke and the lead was lost. I have the depths\r\naccording to him, and will give them in their proper place. One would\r\nexpect, in such an expanse of water as this, to find some of it shallow,\r\nbut it appears from all the evidence I could gather that vessels drawing\r\nfrom eight to ten feet of water would find no difficulty in navigation\r\nas far as Great Slave lake. Although the river is reported to be shallow\r\nwhere it leaves this lake, doubtless a channel could be found affording\r\nthe draught above mentioned.\r\n\r\n“In the fall of 1887, a whale made its way up the river to the Ramparts,\r\nremaining there the whole season, and before the river froze over it was\r\noften seen blowing. At first the Indians were afraid, but they soon\r\nbecame accustomed to the sight, and shot at the whale whenever it\r\napproached the shore. In the spring its dead body was beached by the ice\r\non the west shore seven or eight miles below Fort Good Hope, and the\r\nIndians used part of it for dog meat. I enquired its dimensions of\r\nseveral who had seen it. They described it as being about twice as long\r\nas one of their canoes and thicker through than their own height. This\r\nwould mean a length of from twenty-five to twenty-eight feet. I have\r\noften heard it stated that all the channels of Mackenzie delta are\r\nshallow, but the presence of this whale assures us that one of them at\r\nleast is over six feet deep.”\r\n\r\n                 OVER THREE THOUSAND MILES OF WATERWAY.\r\n\r\nMr. Ogilvie claims that there is a grand total of three thousand three\r\nhundred and sixty-nine miles of water in Mackenzie basin, all navigable,\r\nexcept for eighteen miles, at but two points, one a rapid two miles long\r\non Peace river, and the other Sixteen Mile rapid on Great Slave river. A\r\nthorough knowledge of the two great lakes (Great Bear and Great Slave)\r\nwith all their tributary streams would probably increase this vast\r\nlength of navigable water by several hundred miles. This does not take\r\ninto account the Mackenzie delta and sea near its mouth, of the\r\nnavigability of which nothing very definite is known at present.\r\n\r\nMr. Ogilvie, writing in 1890, figured out these distances in this\r\nway:—“The Hudson’s Bay Company’s steamer ‘Grahame’ traverses the waters\r\nof Peace and Athabaska rivers, the former from the falls to the rapid at\r\nFort Smith, and the latter up to McMurray. The distance from Chipewyan\r\nto the post at the falls on Peace river is two hundred and twenty-two\r\nmiles.”\r\n\r\n“During the last two years the Hudson’s Bay Company has had another\r\nsteamer, the ‘Athabaska,’ plying on upper Athabaska river, between\r\nLittle Slave river and Grand rapids. Both this steamer and the ‘Grahame’\r\non the lower river are flat bottomed stern-wheelers, drawing, when\r\nloaded, not more than two and a half to three feet of water. They can\r\neach carry about one hundred and forty tons.”\r\n\r\n“Upper Peace river is navigable for steamers drawing three or four feet\r\nof water, and, with a little improvement at two points, a draught of\r\nfive to six feet could be utilized. This upper Peace river affords a\r\nnavigable stretch of five hundred and fifty-seven miles, which, with two\r\nhundred and twenty-two miles on lower Peace river, and two hundred on\r\nLake Athabaska, and, say, two hundred on the lower Athabaska, together\r\nwith the distance given in the above table, gives us two thousand five\r\nhundred and sixty-nine miles of navigable water.”\r\n\r\n“From our present knowledge, meagre as it is, I think we may assume that\r\nGreat Slave lake affords us at least five hundred miles more,\r\nconsidering its length and its many deep bays. To this we may add two\r\nhundred and forty miles on the Liard, and at least sixty on Peel river.”\r\n\r\n                       THE SEASON OF NAVIGATION.\r\n\r\nAs to the length of the season of navigation on the Mackenzie, Mr. Wm.\r\nOgilvie, in his report, publishes some tables showing dates at which the\r\nice formed and broke up at Fort Norman (latitude about 65°), and Fort\r\nSimpson (latitude 61° 52′ north). These tables were compiled from\r\nfigures taken from the journals kept at all Hudson’s Bay Company’s\r\nposts. From these figures it appears that the first ice, between 1872\r\nand 1888, never formed earlier than October 7 at Fort Norman, and in\r\n1883 did not form until October 24. The earliest date at which the river\r\nwas closed by the ice was November 2, in 1879, and the latest November\r\n18, in 1874. The earliest date at which the ice broke up was May 9, in\r\n1879, and the latest May 24, in 1887.\r\n\r\nAt Fort Simpson, during the decade of 1876-1886, the drift ice was seen\r\nas early as October 11, in 1884, and as late as November 12, in 1879.\r\nThe earliest date at which the river closed was November 17, in 1876,\r\nand the latest was November 30, in 1882. The earliest date at which the\r\nice broke up was May 1, in 1883, and the latest May 14, in 1876.\r\n\r\n                     LANDMARKS ALONG THE MACKENZIE.\r\n\r\nSome notes culled from Mr. Ogilvie’s report as to the principal\r\ntributaries of the Mackenzie between Great Slave lake and the sea, and\r\nas to a few of the more remarkable stretches of the main river, will\r\nprove interesting at this point. Seventy miles below Great Slave lake is\r\nLittle lake, which is about twelve miles long and ten to twelve miles\r\nwide, being merely an expansion of the river, like Lakes St. Francis and\r\nSt. Peter in St. Lawrence system. Thirty-six miles lower down,\r\nYellowknife river enters the Mackenzie from the south. It would appear\r\nfrom the statements of Indians to Mr. Ogilvie that this is the largest\r\ntributary of the Mackenzie between the Liard and Fort Providence.\r\nTwenty-seven miles below the confluence of the Yellowknife, and\r\ncontinuing to a short distance above the confluence of the Liard, the\r\nMackenzie narrows to an average width of a little over half a mile, with\r\na generally swift current. This continues for seventy and a half miles\r\nor nearly as far as Fort Simpson, near the mouth of the Liard and causes\r\nthis part of the river to be called “The Line,” from the fact that large\r\nboats cannot be rowed against the current, but have to be hauled by a\r\nline attached to them, and pulled by men on shore. This is the common\r\nmode of navigation on all the northern rivers where there are no\r\nsteamers, as it is less laborious than rowing against a current.\r\n\r\nBy the survey it is seven hundred and fifty-eight and one-half miles\r\nfrom Fort Simpson to Fort McPherson. The former fort is situated on an\r\nisland just below the junction of Mackenzie and Liard rivers.\r\n\r\nNinety miles below Fort Simpson, on the west side, a river flows in from\r\nthe southwest. Mr. Ogilvie had seen its name spelled Na-hone, but\r\nremembered that it is spelled by the Reverend Father Petitot, Na-hauner.\r\nIt is, however, now known as North Nahanni river. This stream, as seen\r\nfrom the opposite side of the river, seems about two hundred yards wide,\r\nbut it is shallow and rough at the mouth as was ascertained by the noise\r\nof its waters being plainly heard across the Mackenzie, here a mile\r\nwide. Mr. Ogilvie could get no information as to what it was like for\r\nany distance above its mouth, but it pierces the range of mountains to\r\nthe west, which here come close to the river. The valley thus formed can\r\nbe seen extending southwesterly through the mountains for many miles.\r\nThe banks in the stretch of the Mackenzie from Simpson to this point are\r\nalternately low and swampy and moderately high, consisting of gravel and\r\nsand.\r\n\r\n                           SOME TRIBUTARIES.\r\n\r\nSixteen miles below the confluence of the North Nahanni, but from the\r\nopposite or eastern side, Willow lake river enters the Mackenzie. It is\r\na quarter of a mile wide, deep with a slack current. It is said to flow\r\nout of a lake of considerable extent, not far from the Mackenzie.\r\n\r\nThirty-nine miles lower down, and three and a half miles above Fort\r\nWrigley, a stream known to the Indians as “The River between Two\r\nMountains” discharges into the Mackenzie from the east. It is about one\r\nhundred and fifty yards wide and shallow.\r\n\r\nSeventy-four miles below Fort Wrigley, on the west side, a river\r\ndischarges a large volume of clear, black water, which rushes bodily\r\nhalf way across the Mackenzie, and preserves its distinctive character\r\nfor several miles before it mingles with the main stream. The name\r\napplied to this river by the people at Fort Wrigley was “La Rivière le\r\nVieux Grand Lac.” It is said to flow out of a lake of considerable\r\nextent lying not far from the Mackenzie. Many peaks can be seen up its\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nA little more than thirty miles lower down, on the same side of the\r\nriver, another stream enters, apparently not more than a hundred yards\r\nwide at its mouth. Mr. Ogilvie saw it from the opposite side of the\r\nriver only, and heard nothing concerning it.\r\n\r\nA small stream enters the Mackenzie opposite this place, and up its\r\nvalley, about two miles eastward from the river, a sharp peak rising one\r\nthousand five hundred feet above the water was noted by Mr. Ogilvie.\r\n\r\n                             GRAVEL RIVER.\r\n\r\nForty-one miles below the confluence of le Vieux Grand Lac river, or\r\nsixty-five miles, by the survey, above Fort Norman, a large river enters\r\nfrom the west. It is shallow at its mouth, as it is throughout its\r\ncourse, according to the reports of the Indians. The current, they say,\r\nis swift. They ascend it a long way in the winter to hunt, and descend\r\nin the spring on rafts. How far they go up, Mr. Ogilvie could not learn,\r\ntheir unit of distance being the unknown quantity of a day’s travel, but\r\nthey go much farther than on any other tributary of the lower river.\r\n\r\nMr. Ogilvie obtained the name from some Indians who had travelled it and\r\nthey called it “Pecat-ah-zah.” This translated means Gravel river, by\r\nwhich name it is known to all the white men in the vicinity, on account\r\nof its shallowness and numerous gravel bars.\r\n\r\nMr. Keele, reporting upon his descent of Gravel river in 1908,\r\nwrote:—“On Gravel river the high mountains approach to within a\r\ndistance of about fifty miles of Mackenzie river, and are then replaced\r\nby a belt of foothills about three thousand feet in height above\r\nsea-level. These foothills in turn decline in elevation and finally die\r\nout in a broken, wooded plain, about six hundred feet above sea-level,\r\nbordering Mackenzie river. Gravel river has built up an alluvial flat at\r\nits mouth, and several alluvial islands in the Mackenzie below this\r\npoint are probably due to the great load of sediment carried in at\r\nflood-time. On account of the long period of sunshine during the days,\r\nnearly all the snow disappears from Mackenzie mountains before the\r\nsummer ends. Vegetation advances very rapidly in summer, and where the\r\nsoil is good, vegetables of many kinds may be grown along the river\r\nbanks in the principal valleys.”\r\n\r\n                              FORT NORMAN.\r\n\r\nFort Norman is situated on the east bank of the Mackenzie just above the\r\nentrance of Great Bear river. This river is from two to three hundred\r\nyards wide at the mouth, with a moderate current, but a short distance\r\nup becomes shallow and the current increases. The color of the water is\r\na beautiful greenish-blue, although when Mr. Ogilvie passed it was\r\nsomewhat turbid.\r\n\r\nTen miles below Great Bear river, a stream about one hundred yards wide\r\ncomes in on the westerly side.\r\n\r\nEighty-three miles below Fort Norman, or six and one-half miles above\r\nSans Sault rapids, Carcajou river empties its waters into the Mackenzie\r\nfrom the west.\r\n\r\nNearly five miles lower down again, a river called Mountain river flows\r\nin from the west. It is from one hundred to one hundred and fifty yards\r\nwide, and shallow.\r\n\r\n                           SANS SAULT RAPID.\r\n\r\nLess than a mile farther down Sans Sault rapid is reached. This is all\r\non one side of the river, which is here a mile and a quarter wide. As\r\nMr. Ogilvie went up the west side, and the rapid was on the other,\r\nextending but little more than a third of the way across, he did not see\r\nanything of it. He heard the roar plainly enough, but saw nothing except\r\na swift current. It is caused by a ledge of rocks extending partially\r\nacross the river. Captain Bell of the “Wrigley,” reported deep water in\r\nthe channel at the end of the ledge, and the steamer has no serious\r\ntrouble in ascending. In very low water it is said that this rock is\r\nscarcely covered.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile above the Ramparts there is a similar rapid when the water\r\nis low, but when Mr. Ogilvie passed there was no sign of it.\r\n\r\nThirty-seven miles below Sans Sault rapid and twenty-one miles above\r\nFort Good Hope, Beaver river joins on the west, but as Mr. Ogilvie\r\ncontinued only on the east side he saw only its mouth, which appeared to\r\nbe about one hundred yards wide. An Indian with him said that it took\r\nits name from the number of beavers formerly found on it. This stream\r\nrises in the mountains, but does not seem to be of any importance.\r\n\r\nSomewhat less than two miles from Beaver river, and only a short\r\ndistance above the Ramparts, a river flows into the Mackenzie on its\r\nwest side. Mr. Ogilvie saw it only across the river, but it appeared to\r\nbe about two hundred yards wide at its mouth. All he could learn about\r\nit at Fort Good Hope was that it came from far up in the mountains.\r\n\r\n                     THE RAMPARTS OF THE MACKENZIE.\r\n\r\nMr. Ogilvie remarks in his report that in the more southwesterly part of\r\nthe country the Ramparts would be called a “Cañon.” Here, for a distance\r\nof seven miles, the river runs between perpendicular and occasionally\r\noverhanging walls of rock. At the upper end they rise fifty or sixty\r\nfeet above the water, but their height increases towards the lower end,\r\nat which point they are not less than one hundred and fifty feet above\r\nwater. At the upper end the cañon is not more than half a mile wide, but\r\nits walls gradually expand three miles down, and the width gradually\r\nexpands to nearly a mile at the lower end. Sir Alexander Mackenzie when\r\npassing through sounded at its upper end, and found three hundred feet\r\nof water, which accounts for the fact that, although the cañon is so\r\nnarrow, the current is not perceptibly increased.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. McConnell’s description:—“The Ramparts form one of the\r\nmost interesting features of the Mackenzie. For some distance above, the\r\nriver is expanded beyond its usual size, but here suddenly contracts to\r\nabout five hundred yards in width, and bending to the east runs for\r\nthree or four miles between vertical walls of limestone and shale. At\r\nthe upper end of the gorge the bounding cliffs are a hundred and\r\ntwenty-five feet in height, but increase towards the lower end to about\r\ntwo hundred and fifty feet. The current is steady and runs at the rate\r\nof four or five miles an hour. In high water there is no sign of a\r\nrapid, but in low water a considerable fall occurs near the head, and it\r\nis only with difficulty that York boats are taken up. The Ramparts are\r\nfrequently the scene of great ice jams in the spring and the dammed-back\r\nwater is stated to have risen on one occasion over a hundred feet, and\r\non its recession left a boat stranded on the heights above.”\r\n\r\n                            FORT GOOD HOPE.\r\n\r\nFort Good Hope is situated a couple of miles or so below the lower end\r\nof the Ramparts. According to Mr. Preble (See p. 22), Fort Good Hope\r\nprobably existed in effect as a Northwest post early in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, but accounts differ as to the precise location, both Sans Sault\r\nrapid and the foot of the Ramparts being given as the earliest site. A\r\ntemporary post was built in the summer of 1805 at “Bluefish river,”\r\nabout sixty miles below the mouth of Bear lake river. (Masson, Les\r\nBourgeois, II, p. 104, 1890). It was established as a Hudson’s Bay\r\nCompany’s post on the west bank of the Mackenzie, about one hundred\r\nmiles below the Ramparts, about 1823, after the union of the rival\r\ncompanies, being spoken of by Franklin in 1825, as “but recently\r\nestablished.” It was removed about 1835 to Manitou island, below the\r\nRamparts, where its site may still be seen on the eastern shore of the\r\nisland nearly opposite the present establishment. It was destroyed in\r\nJune, 1836, by a flood caused by an ice jam in the Ramparts, and was\r\nrebuilt on its present site in 1837.\r\n\r\n                            THE GRAND VIEW.\r\n\r\nThe “Grand View” is a name given to an expanded portion of the Mackenzie\r\nbelow Fort Good Hope, about twenty miles in length. Mr. McConnell\r\nwrites:—“The river here is almost straight, but curves gently to the\r\nnorth, and is from two to three miles wide. Its great width gives it\r\nmore the appearance of a lake than a river, and in no other part of the\r\nMackenzie is the magnitude of the mighty volume of water which this\r\nriver carries to the sea, impressed so forcibly on the mind. The banks\r\nare low and the sinuous shore-lines show a succession of wooded points\r\nstretching out until concealed by the haze of the atmosphere. The\r\nbordering plains slope gently down almost to the water’s edge, and are\r\ncovered with a scattered growth of willow, spruce and tamarack, with\r\nhere and there patches of aspens on the drier ridges.”\r\n\r\nA little over two miles below Fort Good Hope, Hare Indian river flows\r\ninto the Mackenzie on its east side. It is about two hundred yards wide\r\nat its mouth, and is said to preserve this width for a long distance.\r\nThe Indians report that this stream rises in a range of hills on the\r\nnorthwest side of Great Bear lake, but about its navigability Mr.\r\nOgilvie could learn nothing.\r\n\r\nTwenty-two miles lower down Loon river enters from the east. This river\r\nis from eighty to one hundred yards wide. An old man whom Mr. Ogilvie\r\nmet at Fort Good Hope had explored this stream for some distance and\r\ngave him the following notes:—For eight miles there is good navigation,\r\nthen a rapid half a mile long occurs, at the head of which is a lake\r\nabout three miles long and one broad, in which the Indians catch many\r\nfish. This is called “Rorrie lake” and, some distance above it, is\r\nanother some two miles in diameter, and called “Round lake” from its\r\nshape. Above this again is a succession of lakes for many days’ travel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Eskimo Boy at Arctic Red river.]\r\n\r\nOne hundred and thirty miles below Loon river a stream one hundred yards\r\nwide enters from the northeast. This is a river which the old man at\r\nFort Good Hope described to Mr. Ogilvie as one up which a Hudson’s Bay\r\nCompany’s officer went many years ago to its source, which he found to\r\nbe not far from the head waters of Anderson river, which flows into\r\nArctic ocean. It would appear from the old man’s statement that several\r\ntrips up it have been made since, but this information was vague, and\r\nMr. Ogilvie afterwards met no one who could give him a reliable account\r\nof this river.\r\n\r\nSixty miles lower down, Red river enters the Mackenzie on its west side\r\njust at the foot of the Narrows. It is about two hundred yards wide at\r\nits mouth and appears to be shallow. As far as Mr. Ogilvie could learn\r\nfrom persons acquainted with the river, it comes from a flat, swampy\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n                       WHERE THE RIVER BRANCHES.\r\n\r\nWhere the upper end of the branch of the Mackenzie channel on which Fort\r\nMcPherson is situated connects with Mackenzie proper, according to Mr.\r\nOgilvie:—“The channel is three-fourths of a mile wide, but it is only\r\none of four, there being four large islands there. The whole width of\r\nthe river cannot be less than three or four miles.\r\n\r\n“Looking northward down the westerly channel the view is bounded by the\r\nsky and widens in the distance so that one can fancy he is looking out\r\nto sea. This can hardly be so; but, from the altitude of the bank where\r\nI stood, added to my own height, the horizon must have been six miles\r\naway, and a bank in the channel of equal height to that on which I stood\r\nwould have been visible twice that distance. Now, if the supposed bank\r\nwas timbered, as was that on which I stood, it would be visible ten or\r\ntwelve miles farther, but none was in sight.\r\n\r\n“From the entrance of the small channel of Peel river to the head of the\r\nupper island in the Mackenzie is nine miles. From the west shore to the\r\nsoutherly point of this island is a mile and a quarter; from the island\r\nto the east shore the distance is nearly as great, showing the river to\r\nbe more than two miles wide at this point. However, it gradually\r\nnarrows, and five miles above this is a little over a mile wide, which\r\nit averages up to the narrows, about sixty miles from Fort McPherson, or\r\ntwenty-eight from where we entered it.\r\n\r\n“A north wind raises quite a swell here and the salty odour of the sea\r\nair is quite perceptible above the delta.”\r\n\r\n                      AGRICULTURAL POSSIBILITIES.\r\n\r\nAlexander Mackenzie and the explorers who immediately followed him down\r\nthe great river of the north, being fur traders, devoted no space in\r\ntheir published journals to a discussion of the agricultural\r\npossibilities of the country, and as their time was necessarily\r\nrestricted they took no time on their journeys to examine any part of\r\nthe territory, contenting themselves with noting the main features\r\naffecting the navigation of the main stream, the mouths, the\r\ntributaries, the occurrence of game, Indian camps, etc.\r\n\r\nFollowing close upon the establishment of permanent trading posts and\r\nmissions, came the pioneer attempts at agriculture in Mackenzie valley,\r\nand we find members of the first exploring parties sent to the country\r\nfor scientific research commenting upon the crude experiments of the\r\npioneer agriculturalists.\r\n\r\nDoctor John Richardson, who accompanied Franklin’s expedition in 1826\r\n(See p. 13), in his volume “The Polar Regions”, in a general description\r\nof the resources of the country at that date, wrote:—“Wheat has not\r\nbeen raised within the Arctic circle in America, nor indeed within six\r\ndegrees of latitude of it. It requires a summer heat of one hundred and\r\ntwenty days, but it is said to be cultivated up to the 62nd or 64th\r\nparallel on the west side of Scandinavian peninsula. Barley ripens well\r\nat Fort Norman on the 65th parallel, in the valley of the Mackenzie,\r\nafter the lapse of ninety-two days from the time of its being sown. All\r\nattempts to cultivate it at old Fort Good Hope, two degrees farther\r\nnorth, have failed. Sixty-six degrees of latitude may therefore be\r\nconsidered as the extreme limit of the barley in Norway. Oats do not\r\nsucceed so far north as barley here.\r\n\r\n“At Fort Good Hope, on the Mackenzie (the new fort), in latitude 66¼\r\ndegrees north, a few turnips and radishes, and some other culinary\r\nvegetables, are raised in a sheltered corner, which receives the\r\nreflection of the sun’s rays from the walls of the house, but none of\r\nthe cerealia will grow, and potatoes do not repay the labour.”\r\n\r\n                      DOMESTIC CATTLE INTRODUCED.\r\n\r\nDoctor Richardson again referred to the same subject, after his return\r\nfrom his trip with Doctor Rae in 1848 in search of Sir John Franklin’s\r\nmissing party, and we find in his book published after his return to\r\nEngland, “The Arctic Searching Expedition” (Vol. 1., p. 153), the\r\nfollowing:—“We reached Fort Resolution at 10 a.m. and having received\r\nsome supplies of fish, and two or three deals for repairing the boats,\r\nwe resumed our voyage, after a halt at the Fort for an hour. Domestic\r\ncattle have been introduced at this place, and at the posts generally\r\nthroughout the country, even up to Peel river and Fort Good Hope and\r\nwithin the Arctic circle. At this season the moschetoes (mosquitos)\r\nprevent them from feeding, except when urged by extreme hunger, and\r\nfires are made for their accommodation near the forts, to which they\r\ncrowd, and lying to leeward amidst the smoke, ruminate at their ease.”\r\n\r\nAt page 165, regarding Fort Simpson (61° 51′ 25′′ north 121° 51′ 15′′\r\nwest) Richardson in the same book writes:—“Barley is usually sown here\r\nfrom May 20 to 25, and is expected to be ripe on August 20—ninety-two\r\ndays. In some seasons it has ripened on August 15. Oats do not thrive\r\nquite so well, and wheat does not come to maturity. Potatoes yield well\r\nand no disease has yet affected them, though early frost sometimes hurts\r\nthe crop. Barley in favorable seasons gives a good return at Fort\r\nNorman, which is farther down the river; and potatoes and various garden\r\nvegetables grow there. The 60th parallel of latitude may, therefore, be\r\nconsidered as about the northern limit of cerealia in this meridian; for\r\nthough in good seasons and in warm sheltered spots a little barley might\r\npossibly be reared at Fort Good Hope, the attempts hitherto made there\r\nhave failed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oat field at Fort Simpson.]\r\n\r\n“A number of milch cows are kept at Fort Simpson, and one or two fat\r\noxen are killed annually. Hay for the winter provender of the stock is\r\nmade about one hundred miles up the river, where there are good meadows\r\nor marshes, and whence it is rafted down in boats in September.”\r\n\r\n                           LAPLAND REINDEER.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of immense numbers of caribou in the Canadian Northland\r\n(see chapters XVIII and XXII), and the fact that this animal in its\r\nappearance and habits is practically identical with the Lapland\r\nreindeer, which has been successfully introduced into Labrador and\r\nAlaska, have led to the belief that the last mentioned animal might be\r\nintroduced with splendid results into the country, and the Department of\r\nthe Interior has inaugurated an experiment to ascertain if the plan is\r\nfeasible. In September, 1911, three carloads of reindeer were despatched\r\nto Fort Smith, where they are being taken care of. As these animals\r\nserve as beasts of burden, as well as provide meat, milk and leather,\r\nthis experiment might have an important effect upon the future\r\ndevelopment of all these northern areas.\r\n\r\n                      GRAIN GROWING AT FORT LIARD.\r\n\r\nAt page 170 in the same volume, referring to Fort Liard, Richardson\r\nstates:—“Though this post is more elevated than Fort Simpson, by at\r\nleast one hundred and fifty feet, and is only ten degrees of latitude to\r\nthe southward, its climate is said to be very superior, and its\r\nvegetable production of better growth and quality. Barley and oats yield\r\ngood crops, and in favorable seasons wheat ripens well. This place,\r\nthen, or the 60th parallel, may be considered as a northern limit of the\r\neconomical culture of wheat.”\r\n\r\nWhatever the discouragements of the pioneer agriculturalists in\r\nMackenzie valley may have been, there was sufficient encouragement to\r\ninduce the missionaries and employees of the fur companies stationed in\r\nthe country to persevere.\r\n\r\nMr. A. Isbister, a native of the West, who had lived for three years in\r\nMackenzie river district, but left that country when under twenty years\r\nof age, examined before the British parliamentary committee of 1857,\r\nstated that he had himself raised barley, oats and potatoes as far north\r\nas Fort Norman on Mackenzie river, upwards of a thousand miles from the\r\nUnited States boundary and near the Arctic circle. On the Liard, large\r\ncrops could be raised, as the soil is better on that river, and wheat\r\nhad been occasionally raised there. It was possible that settlement\r\nmight extend to Great Bear lake. There would be sufficient territory in\r\nthe north to make “a very large state indeed.” Asked if he thought that\r\nthe whole country on Mackenzie river was all adapted to the wants of\r\ncivilized man, Mr. Isbister remarked:—“The climate is very severe\r\nthere, but the soil, so far as I have an opportunity of judging, is\r\ntolerably well adapted for cultivation. You can raise barley and\r\npotatoes very well indeed, without any risk whatsoever.”\r\n\r\n                      BARLEY ALWAYS RIPENED THERE.\r\n\r\nIn the Dominion Government Pacific Railway report of 1878 it is stated\r\n(p. 333):—“Mr. Hardisty, late Chief Factor in charge of Fort Simpson in\r\nlatitude 61·8°, informed Professor Macoun that barley always ripened\r\nthere; that wheat was sure four times out of five. Melons if started\r\nunder glass ripened well, frost seldom doing them much harm.” In the\r\n1880 report Reverend D. M. Gordon is quoted (p. 102) as authority for\r\nthe statement that “wheat is grown as far north as Fort Simpson.” In the\r\nreport of 1878 (p. 333) it is also stated:—“Chief trader Macdougall, in\r\n1875, said all kinds of grain and garden stuff always come to maturity\r\nat Fort Liard (latitude 60·25°).”\r\n\r\nIn 1882 Doctor Bompas, the heroic Church of England Bishop of Mackenzie\r\nriver, in the course of a report to the Society for the Propagation of\r\nthe Gospel, wrote:—“The English schoolmaster at Simpson has made\r\nsuccessful experiments of farming in that northern region, and through\r\nhis energetic labours a good crop of barley was raised in the mission\r\nfields; also some wheat and potatoes, beans, pease, beet roots and other\r\nvegetables.”\r\n\r\nThe evidence taken before the select committee of the Senate of Canada\r\nin 1888 as to agricultural possibilities in Mackenzie valley, excited\r\ngeneral interest.\r\n\r\n                         MANY NATURAL PRAIRIES.\r\n\r\nThe Right Reverend Isidore Clut, O.M.I., missionary Bishop of Arindele,\r\nwhose diocese included Mackenzie basin, and whose name is still held\r\nwith reverence throughout this country, examined before the Committee\r\nstated that in several places in the basin of the Mackenzie there were a\r\ngreat number of natural prairies, those with round hay and those with\r\nflat hay. The round hay, in certain places, grew from three to five feet\r\nin height. The flat hay was also very fine but a little shorter. It grew\r\neverywhere in the low and wet places.\r\n\r\nAt the Roman Catholic mission at Providence, the residence of the\r\nbishop, one year he had one thousand four hundred and forty barrels of\r\npotatoes—(one barrel, ten gallons)—from sixty kegs of seed, but this\r\nwas a very favourable year. They had been greatly favoured by the heat\r\nand by rain at opportune times. On two or three occasions they had had a\r\nthousand and twelve hundred barrels of the same roots.\r\n\r\nAt the Providence mission there was an excellent clay, which was very\r\ngood for cultivation. Throughout the country in general the bishop found\r\nall sorts of land, black soil, loam, clay, sand, marl, etc. Generally\r\nthey harvested their potatoes at Providence from September 20 to 30.\r\nTurnips, carrots, beets, etc., they harvested a little later. Wheat on\r\nthe banks of Peace river and Liard river was ripe towards the end of\r\nAugust; at Athabaska and at Providence from September 15 to 25. Barley\r\nwas ripe a little sooner throughout. Rye does not ripen any sooner than\r\nwheat, but witness had not made many experiments, for the reason that\r\nthey like wheat better than rye. Oats they harvested at the same time as\r\nwheat, but they had sowed them only once. Potatoes they harvested at\r\nAthabaska and at Providence, from September 20 to 30. Turnips, carrots,\r\nbeets, radishes, etc., they harvest later. Indian corn generally cannot\r\nget ripened below Athabaska or on the Mackenzie. Strawberries commenced\r\nto ripen towards July 15; gooseberries ripened towards the end of\r\nAugust, and at the commencement of September. Raspberries and currants\r\ncome after the strawberries. There were also in places many blueberries,\r\ncranberries, and other small fruits, such as poires sauvages\r\n(Saskatoon), etc. Barley ripened at Fort Norman, at the mouth of Great\r\nBear lake river. Consequently it grew at Fort Wrigley, Fort Simpson, and\r\nat Fort Providence. In Liard river and Peace river countries it\r\nsucceeded also very well. Brother Kearney and the Hudson’s Bay Company\r\nhad grown potatoes at Fort Good Hope (Arctic circle). At the mission at\r\nProvidence, and at all the Roman Catholic missions on Mackenzie river,\r\nLiard river, Peace river and Slave river, etc., potatoes and other\r\nvegetables were\r\n\r\n                     CULTIVATED VERY SUCCESSFULLY.\r\n\r\nWheat grew, according to the Bishop’s evidence, at Providence mission,\r\nand at Fort Simpson, but it rarely arrived at perfect maturity. It\r\nripened much better on the borders of Liard river and Peace river. At\r\nthe mission of the Nativity (Chipewyan at Lake Athabaska) they had often\r\ngrown fine wheat. At the mission of the Nativity (Athabaska), at Fort\r\nResolution (Great Slave lake), at Fort Smith, at the mission of Fort\r\nProvidence, they sowed from the time the land began to thaw, that is to\r\nsay, from May 15 until June 8 or 10. Throughout the length of Liard and\r\nPeace rivers, sowing began a little earlier. At the end of August they\r\nhad already harvested barley and wheat.\r\n\r\nPlants which were deep in the ground, such as potatoes, took a good deal\r\nof time to spring up because of the ground being frozen below, but those\r\nwhich were near the surface of the ground commenced to grow very soon,\r\nand the nearer one approached the north, for example at the Arctic\r\ncircle, the more rapidly did the vegetation begin, because of the\r\ngreater length of the days, or the days being without nights. In 1886\r\nthe bishop observed the matter at Good Hope. Towards June 7 or 8,\r\nvegetation commenced, and in five or six days the leaves of the trees\r\nhad reached their natural size. It was because it commenced to be warm\r\nthen, and very warm, and that continued, save when sometimes north winds\r\nset in, which would bring back the snow and cold and sometimes injure\r\nthe crops.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult, Bishop Clut remarked, to say the extent of country fit\r\nfor pasturage, and the cultivation of cereals or other plants, for the\r\nreason that cultivation had not been tried, except by the missionaries,\r\nand a little by the Hudson’s Bay Company.\r\n\r\nDuring his examination before the committee, Bishop Clut was\r\nasked:—“How far north has the potato been grown to your knowledge?”\r\n\r\nHe replied:—“We raise potatoes even as far north as the Arctic circle,\r\nat Fort Good Hope, but they are very small. We have no bread there, and\r\nan Irish brother has\r\n\r\n                     RAISED POTATOES EVERY SUMMER.\r\n\r\nOnce I passed a winter there and they had very little potatoes. Out of\r\nfive bushels planted they got only six bushels. Two years ago I passed\r\nthe winter there, and out of ten kegs planted they got twenty-five.” The\r\nbishop added that there were then at nearly all of the missions gardens\r\nin which were raised potatoes, carrots, beets, onions, cabbages, turnips\r\nand lettuce. Even at Fort Good Hope they raised turnips and carrots.\r\n\r\nWild roses grew in abundance as far north as Good Hope.\r\n\r\nHorses, at that date, had not been taken farther than Great Slave lake,\r\nbut cattle had been taken as far north as Fort Good Hope. They were\r\nfound at the principal establishments of the missionaries, and at the\r\nforts of the Hudson’s Bay Company.\r\n\r\nBishop Clut stated that he was certain that if Mackenzie country became\r\nsettled and cultivated on a large scale, the occasional white frosts of\r\nthe summer months would be much less frequent. That was the result which\r\nthey had already observed at their principal mission posts; the more\r\nthey cleared to any extent the less were the fields susceptible to\r\nfrost. The months of September and October were generally dry, and the\r\nblue sky made them charming. In general they had a clear sky without a\r\ncloud and that is what makes the climate so healthy in the basin of the\r\nMackenzie. People could live there to a greater age than in any other\r\npart of the globe.\r\n\r\n                    “CHINOOKS” AT THE ARCTIC CIRCLE.\r\n\r\nAt Arctic circle the southwest “Chinook” wind often made its effect\r\nfelt, even in winter. The Rev. Father Séguin and Brother Kearney, who\r\nhad been at Good Hope for twenty-eight years had observed its effect.\r\nThe bishop had observed it also himself during the winters of 1885 and\r\n1886. This wind modified the temperature a good deal. The missionaries\r\nhad not remarked that the intensity of the frost had any effect on the\r\nnative trees of the country. The bishop had not kept account himself of\r\nthe degrees of heat in summer, but he was able to say that it was\r\nexcessively hot; and the farther one went towards the north the warmer\r\nhe would find it becoming; and that heat lasted the twenty-four hours of\r\nthe day, without sensibly diminishing in its intensity from 10 p.m. to 3\r\na.m.\r\n\r\nEx-Judge Malcolm MacLeod, Q.C., of Aylmer, Que., a northwesterner by\r\nbirth, on examination before the committee produced a number of letters\r\nreceived by his father while he held the appointment of senior officer\r\nof the Hudson’s Bay Company in the northern district. Among these\r\nletters was one which showed that the original explorers of the country\r\nbetween the Mackenzie and the Yukon described it as “a land of milk and\r\nhoney.”\r\n\r\nJudge McLeod added:—“We know for certain that at Fort Liard, wheat is a\r\nreliable crop for four years out of five, at any rate.”\r\n\r\nHon. William Christie, ex-member of the Northwest Council, was at one\r\ntime inspecting chief factor of the Hudson’s Bay Company service. This\r\nwitness was examined before the committee and explained that as\r\ninspecting factor of the Hudson’s Bay service he was in charge of all\r\nthe districts from Red river to Fort Simpson—from Fort Garry\r\nnorthward—Red river district, Swan river district, English river\r\ndistrict, Athabaska river district, and Mackenzie river district. All of\r\nthese were\r\n\r\n                         UNDER HIS SUPERVISION.\r\n\r\nHe had travelled over the whole of them and descended Mackenzie river as\r\nfar as Fort Simpson. He did not think that any authoritative attempt had\r\never been made up to that time to collect statistics, etc., as to\r\nresources of this region. The business of the Hudson’s Bay Company was\r\nconfined to the fur trade, and if there were any scientific\r\ninvestigations in the old days these were conducted under the authority\r\nof the British government. The Hudson’s Bay Company’s posts on Mackenzie\r\nriver were established at convenient points for the fur trade all the\r\nway down the river. Fort Simpson was at the head of the whole Mackenzie\r\nriver district.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Potatoes at Fort Simpson.]\r\n\r\nThere was no settlement around any of the company’s forts. The white men\r\nin the forts were largely from England and Scotland—gentlemen’s\r\nsons—and some were married to Indian girls and French half-breeds.\r\nTraders, other than those of the company, were at that date going in for\r\nfurs, up as far as Great Slave lake. The Hudson’s Bay Company opposed\r\nthem the best way they could, but had sold the country to the Canadian\r\ngovernment. The Church of England, as well as the Roman Catholic Church,\r\nhad missions throughout the region, and had had them for many years.\r\n\r\nMr. Christie informed the committee that he did not think there would be\r\nany difficulty in navigating with suitable steamers the Mackenzie from\r\nits headwaters to Arctic ocean, because the year before his examination\r\nthey had had the experience of a successful voyage of the Hudson’s Bay\r\nCompany’s steamer from Fort Simpson down Mackenzie river nearly to its\r\nmouth, below Peel river. They could have gone through to Arctic sea if\r\nthey had wished to do so, but having no pilot, and not knowing which of\r\nthe channels they should take, they did not like to venture. It would\r\nhave been a disastrous thing to the company if that steamer had met with\r\nany accident which would have prevented it from returning to Slave river\r\nthat season.\r\n\r\n                 REACHED THE MACKENZIE FROM THE NORTH.\r\n\r\nAs to outside communication via the north, Mr. Christie considered\r\nnavigation by Hudson bay more certain than by Behring strait. During the\r\nsearch for Sir John Franklin’s lost expedition, however, Commander\r\nPullen, of H.M.S. _Plover_, sailed from Honolulu for Behring strait and\r\nMackenzie river. He went as far north as he possibly could get with the\r\n_Plover_. Then with Lieut. Hooper and some sailors he took to the boats\r\nand coasted along to the outlet of Mackenzie river. The party ascended\r\nthat river with their boats to Fort Simpson the same fall—tracked their\r\nboats. The _Plover_ returned to Honolulu that same season.\r\n\r\nDonald McIvor, farmer, of Kildonan East, Manitoba, who had been sixteen\r\nyears in the Hudson’s Bay Company’s service, and had been stationed in\r\nMackenzie river district for over six years, communicated in writing to\r\nthe committee a very interesting series of answers in response to a\r\nschedule of questions submitted by the committee. Witness explained that\r\nhe considered he had fair knowledge of the district watered by\r\nMackenzie, Athabaska and Slave rivers.\r\n\r\nThe soil is black loam chiefly, sometimes a little sandy. Witness\r\nconsidered three-fourths of the country fit for pasturage or coarse\r\ngrains. Barley and potatoes had been grown successfully as far north as\r\nFort Norman. He saw some wheat, very fine, at Methye portage, grown by\r\nan Indian, but did not know of its being tried further north then. He\r\nnever saw any Indian corn during his stay in the district. At Fort\r\nAthabaska, barley sown the middle of May was ready the first or second\r\nweek in August. Farther north, at Fort Norman, barley sown the middle of\r\nMay could be reaped the middle or the last week in August. In cases\r\nwhere wheat was grown it ripened about the last week in August, potatoes\r\nthe first of September. The ground was usually fit for seeding about\r\nthree weeks after the first spring flowers showed. The summer rains\r\nbegan about the latter end of May. At the time witness was in the\r\ncountry nothing was done to any extent in agriculture. Stock raising was\r\ncarried on at most of the forts, and succeeded admirably.\r\n\r\n                        TEN YEARS AT FORT LIARD.\r\n\r\nWritten answers to a set schedule of questions prepared by the committee\r\nwere submitted by Mr. William James McLean, chief trader of the Hudson’s\r\nBay Company, Lower Fort Garry, Manitoba.\r\n\r\nWitness explained that his personal knowledge of the country under\r\ninvestigation covered trips over the following routes:—From the\r\nwatershed of Mackenzie river basin at the height of land whence\r\nClearwater river takes its rise, down the aforesaid river to its\r\nconfluence with Athabaska river, thence down Athabaska river to Lake\r\nAthabaska and from there to Great Slave lake down Slave river, and out\r\nLake Athabaska, and on through that lake down Mackenzie river to Fort\r\nSimpson, thence up Liard river to Fort Liard, where he was stationed for\r\nten years, from 1863 to 1873. He stated that he planted potatoes and\r\nbarley at Fort Liard generally about May 10, and reaped barley about\r\nAugust 20. Potatoes were fit for use about that time, but were generally\r\ntaken out of the ground about September 20. Turnips were planted and dug\r\nabout the same date as the potatoes. Wild flowers first appeared in the\r\nspring about May 25 at Fort Liard, and June 10 at Fort Simpson. Wild\r\nstrawberries were ripe about the first week in July, gooseberries about\r\nthe first of August. Other small fruit came in from the middle of July\r\nto August 10. The wild vetch or pea grew at Fort Liard, but not to any\r\ngreat extent. Good barley grew at McMurray, Chipewyan, and at Forts\r\nResolution, Simpson and Liard.\r\n\r\n                        WILD BERRIES PLENTIFUL.\r\n\r\nAmong some information as to the fertility of Mackenzie basin\r\ncommunicated in writing to the committee by Mr. Frank Oliver of Edmonton\r\nwas the following:—Berries of various kinds were the only considerable\r\nnatural food product of Mackenzie river country. They were plentiful in\r\ntheir season throughout the whole of the wooded region which extended to\r\nwithin one hundred miles of the Arctic coast. The blueberry was the most\r\nplentiful and was found throughout the whole region. It resembled the\r\nhuckleberry of the east. The blackberry and mossberry come next in\r\nquantity in the far north. The former was not the blackberry of Ontario,\r\nand the latter somewhat resembled the strawberry. From Liard river south\r\nto the Saskatchewan, the raspberry, strawberry, Saskatoon berry,\r\ngooseberry, high and low bush cranberry, chokeberry, and black and red\r\ncurrants flourished as well, besides numerous minor varieties of\r\nberries. In some years berries were much more plentiful than in others.\r\nIn plentiful years they formed an important item of the Indians’ food.\r\nThere was every reason to believe that the varieties found there which\r\nwere cultivated profitably in other countries could be as satisfactorily\r\ncultivated there, at least from the 61st parallel southward, between the\r\nmain streams of the Mackenzie and Rocky mountains.\r\n\r\nMr. Oliver explained that the information communicated was chiefly\r\nacquired from Murdock McLeod, of Edmonton, who spent the years 1862-63\r\nand part of 1864 in the Hudson’s Bay Company service at Fort Anderson,\r\nsince abandoned, east of the Mackenzie and about eighty miles up\r\nAnderson river from Arctic coast. In the summer of 1863 he accompanied\r\nan expedition undertaken on behalf of the Smithsonian Institute, along\r\nthe Arctic coast from the mouth of Mackenzie to that of Coppermine\r\nriver. In 1865 he was at Fort Liard. Mr. McLeod stated that in the\r\nsummer of 1865, while in the Hudson’s Bay employ, at Fort Liard,\r\nlatitude 59¾°, he sowed about three acres of wheat on May 26; this was\r\nin the stook on August 1. It was good grain, though somewhat smutty, and\r\nhad not been frosted; barley sowed at the same time did equally well,\r\nalso potatoes. During several summers’ residence at Fort Liard, Mr.\r\nMcLeod never saw summer frost. He also stated that at Fort Simpson, in\r\nlatitude 62½° wheat, barley and potatoes had done well. This was borne\r\nout by the statement of Reverend Mr. Spendlove, missionary at Fort\r\nSimpson, except that in 1887 the barley was frosted.\r\n\r\n                     PROFESSOR MACOUN’S TESTIMONY.\r\n\r\nProfessor John Macoun (See p. 16), Botanist to the Geological Survey of\r\nCanada, examined before the committee stated that barley ripens at Fort\r\nSimpson, latitude 62°, every year between August 12 and 20. Barley and\r\npotatoes had been grown at Fort Norman at the mouth of Great Bear lake\r\nriver, about latitude 65°, and even at Fort Yukon, in the Arctic circle,\r\nbarley is a sure crop. These are not particular points noted for their\r\ngood soil, but located solely for the fur trade. Five-sixths of the\r\ncountry is just as good as these points, and will in future produce as\r\ngood crops. There is no point east of the Mackenzie suitable for\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nProfessor Macoun said he had been informed by Chief Factor Hardisty,\r\nbrother to Senator Hardisty, who had charge of Mackenzie river district\r\nfor many years, that wheat was a sure crop at Fort Simpson four times\r\nout of five, but that the country around Fort Liard, on Liard river, was\r\nmuch superior to Fort Simpson for agricultural purposes. All kinds of\r\ngarden produce succeeded well, and melons, after being started in a hot\r\nbed, ripened well.\r\n\r\nAccording to Professor Macoun’s evidence Mackenzie valley and the whole\r\nof the northern prairie country has a soil that is largely composed of\r\nwhat is called alluvium; and passing northwards farther down Peace river\r\nto the Mackenzie the surface, from all he could gather from what he had\r\nread, is precisely of the same character as the second prairie steppe,\r\nwhich is the surface of black mould mixed with limestone gravel and\r\ndeeper down there is more gravel and sand in the subsoil.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the country from Edmonton northwesterly to Arctic ocean in\r\nMackenzie valley, Professor Macoun explained, is underlain by Devonian\r\nor cretaceous rock, and by the disintegration of these rocks good soil\r\nis produced always. From everything he could gather, the whole region\r\nnaturally out to the Arctic coast, west of Mackenzie river, has a good\r\nsoil. Easterly is a land of barrenness. The line of the Mackenzie is not\r\nexactly the line. Geologists know that there is a portion of the valley\r\neast of the river and up to the base of the Laurentian rocks where the\r\nland seems to be good—as regards the soil. Professor Macoun said he was\r\ndecidedly of opinion that domesticated animals would in the future be\r\nraised in Mackenzie basin. Sheep, horses, pigs and cattle could and\r\nwould be raised there. It is a law of nature that they cannot fatten\r\ncattle in southern Texas because it is not cold enough to solidify the\r\nfat, as it were, and they have to drive the Texan cattle north and\r\nfatten them. As you go north you find that the cattle\r\n\r\n                           PRODUCE MORE FAT,\r\n\r\nand are more easily fattened, because it is a law of nature that in cold\r\nclimates fat should be laid up.\r\n\r\nAsked as to the native grasses, Professor Macoun remarked:—“As to the\r\nnatural grasses of this country, having just completed an examination of\r\nthe whole grasses of the Dominion, I am safe in stating that they are\r\nthe grasses best suited for pasturage of any known to stock men or\r\nfarmers. The grasses referred to are those known as red-top and Kentucky\r\nblue grass, or, scientifically, _Poa Pratensis_ and _Poa Seratna_, _Poa\r\nTenniflora_ and _Ceasia_. These four species are well known to American\r\nstock men and are considered of the highest value. They are the\r\ncommonest of the grasses in our northern forest region and along the\r\nfoot hills of Rocky mountains. Three of these species are known in the\r\neastern provinces. One of them is exclusively western and the greater\r\npart of the common pasturage of Ontario is altogether composed of _Poa\r\npretensis_ (Kentucky blue grass, or red-top).”\r\n\r\n                         EXPERT INVESTIGATION.\r\n\r\nWhile a committee of the Senate was hearing this evidence as to the\r\nnatural resources of Mackenzie country, two experts, scientific\r\nexplorers, Messrs. McConnell and Ogilvie (See p. 18) were enquiring into\r\nthe subject on the spot on behalf of the Dominion government. The\r\npublication of the official reports of these gentlemen, in due course,\r\nstrengthened the impression made upon the public mind by the evidence\r\ntaken by the Senate committee, but the practical result was not much,\r\nfor there was at that date still plenty of free land to be had in the\r\nso-called “Fertile Belt”, and lack of communication effectually\r\nprevented any deflection of the tide of immigration towards Mackenzie\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nMr. R. G. McConnell in 1887 explored Hay river from its mouth at Great\r\nSlave lake as far as Alexandra falls, about thirty miles in a direct\r\nline up. He reports that for some distance up and while passing through\r\nthe delta, the river is wide and encloses a line of alluvial islands,\r\nbut on getting above these it contracts to about one hundred yards in\r\nwidth. Its banks are low and grassy, and the country on both sides is\r\nthickly forested. Proceeding up the river the general elevation of the\r\ncountry increases, and the valley becomes higher and wider, and\r\nbordering flats make their appearance.\r\n\r\nGrassy and partly wooded plains skirt its southern shores and extend\r\nsouthward towards Peace river, and Hay river may be regarded as\r\npractically the northern limit of the prairie country, although small\r\nisolated plains occur much farther north in the vicinity of Slave river.\r\n\r\n                        PICTURESQUE WATER-FALLS.\r\n\r\nAs to Alexandra falls, so named by Bishop Bompas in honour of the then\r\nPrincess of Wales, Mr. McConnell states that they present a clear\r\nunbroken sheet of falling water, and are exceedingly picturesque in\r\nappearance. The gorge through which the river below flows here suddenly\r\nceases, and the river precipitates itself over the hard limestone band\r\nthrough which the latter is cut, with a sheer descent of about\r\neighty-five feet, as measured by a single reading of the aneroid\r\nbarometer.\r\n\r\nFrom the base of the falls the river flows along rapidly for about a\r\nmile, and then makes a second leap of about fifty feet, below which are\r\nthree miles of rapids. At the lower falls the cliff is broken down near\r\nthe centre, and the descent of the water is interrupted by projecting\r\nledges. Above the falls the river loses its valley almost altogether,\r\nand has failed to produce more than a feeble impression on the hard\r\nlimestone beds which floor the surrounding country. Near the foot of the\r\nrapids below the falls “a graceful effect is produced by a couple of\r\nsmall streams which fling themselves on either hand over the brow of the\r\ncliffs bounding the valley and make one clear leap to the floor\r\nbeneath.”\r\n\r\n                       AGRICULTURE AT RESOLUTION.\r\n\r\nMr. McConnell reported the western arm of Great Slave lake “bordered all\r\naround by a flat wooded country, which has been proved to be adapted to\r\ncultivation of barley, and of potatoes and other vegetables. The soil is\r\nusually a loam, but in the ridges is often sandy, and in low places\r\npasses into a clay. The alluvial lands along Slave river and the grassy\r\nplains on Little Buffalo river are the best sections of the district,\r\nand deserve the first attention. At Fort Resolution a few acres of land\r\nare farmed every year with good results by the Hudson’s Bay Company. Mr.\r\nFlett, who has charge of this post, informed me that barley is usually\r\nsown on May 15, and requires about one hundred and ten days to reach\r\nmaturity. Potatoes are planted about the same date, and are dug about\r\nSeptember 15; wheat, according to the same authority, has been tried\r\nthree times with only one failure. At Hay river, sixty miles west of\r\nFort Resolution, some potatoes are annually grown by the Indians, and\r\neven at Fort Rae, which is situated on a bleak island in the northern\r\narm of the lake in latitude 62° 39′, some gardening has been attempted\r\nby the energetic Roman Catholic missionaries who are stationed there.\r\nThe soil at this place is very stony, and much difficulty was\r\nexperienced in removing the boulders, and in bringing the ground into a\r\nproper state for cultivation. When this was once effected several kinds\r\nof vegetables were grown without trouble. Potatoes planted on May 25 are\r\ndug in the middle of September, and yield twenty fold, and the list of\r\ngarden vegetables raised here includes turnips, onions, cabbages,\r\ncarrots, radishes, beets and peas. Wheat and barley have not been tried\r\non a large scale, but a few grains were sown at the end of May one\r\nseason, and became mature, the latter on August 26, and the former four\r\ndays later. A less favourable spot for farming purposes, than this rocky\r\nisland, could scarcely be obtained, and the successful raising here\r\naffords a promise that the more fertile lands to the west and south will\r\none day be utilized.”\r\n\r\nMr. McConnell in his report on the exploration of Slave river states\r\nthat the soil there “is often sandy, but good crops of potatoes and\r\nother garden vegetables are grown at Fort Smith, and also by the Indians\r\non the east side of the river.”\r\n\r\n                       WHEAT AT FORT PROVIDENCE.\r\n\r\nMr. McConnell referred specially in his report, also, to the\r\nagricultural operations at Fort Providence (where he wintered), Fort\r\nSimpson and Fort Good Hope. He wrote:—“Fort Providence is surrounded by\r\nflat arable lands of good quality, and capable of producing excellent\r\ncrops. Agriculture is engaged in here both by the Hudson’s Bay Company\r\nand the Roman Catholic Mission, and large quantities of farm produce are\r\nannually raised. Wheat has been sown at the Hudson’s Bay Company’s farm\r\nfor nine years, and, according to Mr. Reid, has never been a complete\r\nfailure, although on some occasions it has been slightly touched by\r\nsummer frosts. It is usually sown about May 20, and requires about three\r\nmonths to ripen. As much as twenty-nine bushels have been obtained from\r\none bushel sown. Barley is a sure crop. It is sown at the same time as\r\nthe wheat, and is ripe almost a week earlier. Potatoes are planted\r\nbetween May 16 and 25, and are taken up about September 20. Turnips,\r\ncabbage, beets and numerous other garden vegetables are grown with\r\nscarcely greater difficulty than in latitudes ten degrees farther south.\r\nThe soil is a stiff clay, with in some places surface beds of sand, and\r\nis seldom thawed out to a greater depth than six feet. The muskegs which\r\ncover a considerable proportion of the country back from the river are\r\npermanently frozen at less than two feet from the surface. It must be\r\nborne in mind, however, in this connection, that the histories of other\r\ndistricts have shown that when the country is cleared and the moss burnt\r\noff, the penetrative powers of the summer thaw is at once greatly\r\nincreased, and lands have become productive, which at first appeared\r\nhopelessly barren. A number of cattle are kept at Fort Providence, but\r\nrequire to be fed about seven months in the year. Hay of excellent\r\nquality is obtained in abundance from neighbouring marshes.”\r\n\r\n                       THE FARM AT FORT SIMPSON.\r\n\r\n“Like the other posts Fort Simpson has its farm, and according to some\r\nstatistics which I received from Mr. Laviolette, the various crops\r\nraised, with the exception of wheat, which does not ripen, and the dates\r\nfor planting and reaping are much the same as those previously stated\r\nfor Fort Providence. Potatoes are usually planted between May 15 and 20,\r\nbut this season (1888) were not put in, owing to the unusually late\r\nspring, until May 28, and require about four months to mature. In the\r\nordinary year forty bushels of seed will yield from six to seven hundred\r\nbushels, but the crops are sometimes injured by summer frosts. Barley,\r\nwhich is the only cereal grown, is sown about May 20, and is usually\r\nripe by September 20. No difficulty is experienced in raising such\r\ngarden vegetables as cabbages, turnips, beets, etc., and Mr. Camsell\r\nseemed sanguine that even melons and tomatoes would ripen if properly\r\ntried. The soil here is a stiff clay loam. . . .”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mission Garden at Fort Providence.]\r\n\r\n“Fort Good Hope is situated a short distance below the Ramparts and is\r\nthe lowest fort on the Mackenzie. It was originally built over one\r\nhundred miles lower down, and has been moved several times before the\r\npresent site was finally selected. It is situated only a few miles south\r\nof the Arctic circle, but this does not prevent some gardening from\r\nbeing attempted. Potatoes, turnips and other garden vegetables are\r\nraised in some quantity, and even barley has occasionally been ripened,\r\nalthough the ground is permanently frozen three or four feet from the\r\nsurface. Cattle and poultry are kept at the fort, but the former have to\r\nbe fed over seven months in the year. . . .”\r\n\r\n                     CAN FURNISH LOCAL FOOD SUPPLY.\r\n\r\nIn summing up the result of his explorations, Mr. McConnell stated in\r\nhis report:—“At all the posts of the Hudson’s Bay Company, along the\r\nMackenzie and its tributaries, with the exception of Fort McPherson,\r\nsmall plots of land are annually cultivated and large quantities of\r\npotatoes, turnips, beets and other vegetables are grown for use in the\r\ndistrict, while at Fort Liard and Fort Providence, the two most\r\nsoutherly posts in the district, both wheat and barley have been tried\r\nwith success. There is, however, little reason to hope that Mackenzie\r\nriver district as a whole, or even the southern part of it, except in\r\nlimited areas, will ever be able to support a purely agricultural\r\ncommunity, or that its products will ever be able to compete in the open\r\nmarkets of the world with the produce of more favoured regions. Its\r\nagricultural development will depend on a local market being obtained.\r\nWhen the time comes, as come it must, when the undoubted mineral\r\nresources of the region are drawn upon, the food required by the mining\r\npopulation, or the greater part of it at least, can be supplied locally.\r\nThe amount of arable land is small compared to the total area, and is\r\nmostly confined to the vicinity of the larger streams. Away from the\r\nrivers, frozen marshes and muskegs and shallow lakes cover the greater\r\npart of the surface. The alluvial lands along Slave river, the upper\r\npart of Mackenzie river, and the country bordering the Liard for some\r\ndistance above and below Fort Liard and west of the mountains, are the\r\nbest parts of the district.”\r\n\r\n                      CLIMATE OF MACKENZIE REGION.\r\n\r\nMr. McConnell, in his report of his explorations of both 1887 and 1888,\r\nmakes the following references to the climate along Mackenzie\r\nriver:—“The warm weather which commenced at Fort Simpson on May 1,\r\ncontinued throughout the month, and under its influence the snow quickly\r\ndisappeared, and the spring advanced with astonishing rapidity.\r\n\r\n“In the lower part of the river the ice was broken up at Fort Wrigley on\r\nMay 18, at Fort Norman on May 19, and at Fort Good Hope on May 21. The\r\nice on the river above Fort Simpson, between the mouth of the Liard and\r\nGreat Slave lake, did not, however, move until after June 1.”\r\n\r\nMay 31, 1888, Mr. McConnell found _Anemone patens_, the first flower of\r\nthe season, in full bloom above Fort Wrigley. When Mr. McConnell left\r\nFort Norman June 12, 1888, the trees were still leafless, but the\r\nvarious species of willows and birches had hung out their catkins, and\r\nthe early flowering anemones and other flowers brightened the valley\r\nwith colour. June 18, when Mr. McConnell left Fort Good Hope, _anemone\r\npatens_ and other early flowering plants were in bloom, but the general\r\nforest still remained leafless.\r\n\r\n                          THE LIARD DISTRICT.\r\n\r\nMr. McConnell’s report gives us occasional comprehensive glimpses of the\r\nterritory on either side of the Mackenzie. He says that the surface of\r\nthe country bordering the Mackenzie in the latitude of the Liard, on\r\nboth the lower and higher levels, is usually more or less undulating,\r\nand is diversified by innumerable shallow lakes of all sizes, while a\r\nlarge proportion is underlaid by muskegs and marshes, covered with\r\nsphagnum or bog-moss, which remain frozen throughout the year. The\r\nhigher lands and ridges separating the lakes and marshes are usually\r\nrather densely forested, chiefly with white spruce (_Picea alba_), the\r\nBanksian pine (_Pinus Banksiana_) and the aspen (_Populus tremuloides_).\r\n\r\nAs to the basin of the lower Liard itself, Mr. McConnell mentions the\r\nfollowing facts:—On his way down to the Mackenzie in 1887 he arrived at\r\nFort Liard, fifteen miles below the mouth of the Nelson, on July 29. In\r\nthe reach from the Nelson to Fort Liard, the river is generally wide and\r\nfilled with sandbars and wooded islands. It is bordered in many places\r\nwith wide alluvial flats, covered with tall, straight cotton wood, large\r\nspruce and canoe birch. Its valley is wide and shallow and lined with\r\ngently sloping, spruce-clad banks. On some of the flats the Indians have\r\nbuilt houses, and fenced in small plots for farming purposes, for which\r\nthe greater part of this section of the district seems well adapted. Mr.\r\nMcConnell passed one small Indian farm about thirteen miles below the\r\nmouth of the Nelson, and another one at the mouth of Fishing creek, a\r\nfew miles above Fort Liard, while others were noticed in the lower part\r\nof the river.\r\n\r\n                    FORT LIARD AND ITS ENVIRONMENT.\r\n\r\nFort Liard is situated on a fertile flat, part of which has been\r\ncultivated for years with unfailing success. Wheat and barley are grown\r\nhere year after year, while potatoes, cabbages, turnips, and other\r\nvegetables are raised without the least difficulty. At the time of Mr.\r\nMcConnell’s visit, August 1, “all the crops were well advanced and in\r\ngood condition; the barley was just turning colour, and the potatoes\r\nwere almost large enough to eat. There is no reason, either climatic or\r\notherwise, why the whole country bordering the Liard, from Beaver river\r\nto near its mouth, should not, when needed, support an agricultural\r\ncommunity.” Mr. McConnell climbed one of the mountains near Fort Liard\r\nto a height of three thousand feet and “obtained an extensive view from\r\nthe summit, over the plains to the eastward. The country in that\r\ndirection rises gradually from the river in easy undulations, and\r\nappears to culminate at a distance of twenty-five or thirty miles in a\r\nlow plateau through which Black river has cut a wide gap. A dense\r\nforest, relieved in places by gleaming lakes and light green marshes,\r\nstretches to the horizon.”\r\n\r\nMr. McConnell also states in his report that the valley depression for\r\nsome distance below the fort is insignificant in size, and farther down\r\ndisappears altogether, and the river undulates through a low, level\r\nplain, elevated only a few feet above its surface. Liard river is over a\r\nmile wide at its mouth.\r\n\r\n                      A MACKENZIE VALLEY PLATEAU.\r\n\r\nTen miles above the Blackwater, Mr. McConnell, in his descent of the\r\nMackenzie in 1888, made a visit to a small plateau which there borders\r\nthe river at a distance of three or four miles. The valley of the\r\nMackenzie there has a depth of two hundred feet. After leaving it Mr.\r\nMcConnell crossed a level plain which stretches eastwards to the foot of\r\nthe plateau. This plain proved to be exceedingly wet and swampy, and\r\nmost of the way across he was walking knee-deep through yielding moss or\r\nice-cold water. It is partially wooded with small pine, spruce, aspen\r\nand tamarack, none of which had a diameter exceeding six inches. From\r\nthe top of the plateau, the main range of Rocky mountains, which is here\r\ntoo far from the left bank of the river to be seen from the valley, came\r\ninto sight to the west, while in an opposite direction a good view was\r\nobtained of the rocky range which borders the river to the east. The\r\nplain between these ranges, through which the river flows, has a width\r\nof sixty or seventy miles. It shows numerous lines of wooded heights\r\nrunning parallel with the river, but possesses no conspicuous\r\nelevations.\r\n\r\nMr. McConnell explains that rugged limestone ranges are visible along\r\nthe reach below Fort Norman on both sides of the river, but seldom\r\napproach within thirty miles of each other. The plains between, and\r\nlower slopes of the mountains, are continuously clothed with forests of\r\nsmall spruce and aspen. The depression in which the river flows has a\r\ndepth of from one to four hundred feet and a width of from two to three\r\nmiles. River flats are seldom present, and the banks of the valley slope\r\nmore or less steeply up from the edge of the water.\r\n\r\n                     MR. WILLIAM OGILVIE’S REPORT.\r\n\r\nMr. Ogilvie, in the splendid report of his survey in 1888 (Sessional\r\npapers, 4th Ses. 6th Parlt.), made a special and most comprehensive\r\nreference to the agricultural capabilities of the Mackenzie country. Mr.\r\nOgilvie’s reputation as an experienced and most accurate observer\r\njustifies an extended quotation from this section of the\r\nreport.—“Everywhere, the Mackenzie basin”, he wrote (p. 82), “is quite\r\nas capable, so far as quality of soil is concerned, of supporting an\r\nagricultural population, as the greater part of the provinces of Ontario\r\nand Quebec. The soil, as seen from the river, is generally good, and the\r\nprobability is that it continues so at least as far back from the stream\r\nas the woods extend. This extent is said to vary from twenty to forty\r\nmiles on the east side, where no stream flows in, but where there are\r\nstreams the distance is much greater, as the timber follows the valleys.\r\nBeyond the fringe of timber we come to the so-called barren lands, on\r\nwhich nothing but mosses and lichens grow and which, except as the\r\npasturage of the musk-ox and a few other animals, are practically\r\nuseless, so far as known at present. On the west side of the river the\r\nwoods extend to the timber line on the mountains.\r\n\r\n“Assuming the limits to be as above, the area of the fertile soil can\r\nreadily be found. Speaking only of that portion of Mackenzie basin\r\nextending from Athabaska lake to Arctic ocean, we have a strip of land\r\nnine hundred and forty miles long, and something over sixty wide. This\r\ngives in round numbers sixty thousand square miles of land, the\r\nagricultural capabilities of which we may reasonably discuss. I think\r\nthe above area is less than that actually wooded, but on the west side\r\nmuch of the surface is probably at such an elevation, being near the\r\nmountains, as to be outside the limits of our discussion. Theoretically,\r\nthe points involved are the prevalent temperatures during the growing\r\nmonths, the period of vegetation and the duration of sunshine.\r\n\r\n                       TEMPERATURE AND SUNLIGHT.\r\n\r\n“I do not know of any regular record of temperature having been kept at\r\nFort McPherson, the most northerly point at which anyone is permanently\r\nsettled in the district. The only information which I have is my own\r\nrecord for the last ten days of June while I was camped in the valley\r\nnear the fort. The lowest temperature during that period was 37.3° Fahr.\r\non June 20, and the mean minimum from June 20 to June 30 was 43.3° Fahr.\r\nThe highest observed temperature during the same period was 74° Fahr. at\r\n1:30 p.m. on June 21, and the mean temperature at that hour for the ten\r\ndays was 62° Fahr. The lowest of these temperatures would not injure\r\nvegetation. The mean minimum for the whole month would be below this,\r\nprobably two or three degrees, but even that would not arrest vegetable\r\ngrowth. When, in connection with the temperature, we consider the number\r\nof hours of sunshine in June and July, it seems evident that Fort\r\nMcPherson has all the essentials for the successful cultivation of most\r\ncereals and vegetables. At this northern point refraction extends the\r\ntime during which the sun does not set, so that there are about\r\ntwenty-four hours of sunshine each day from June 1 to July 15. On May 1,\r\nthe sun is up for about seventeen and one-half hours, and during August\r\nthe hours of sunlight vary from nineteen on the 1st to fifteen on the\r\n31st. The total hours of sun are seven hundred and six in May; seven\r\nhundred and twenty in June; six hundred and eighty-four in July; and\r\nfive hundred and twenty-seven in August; in all two thousand six hundred\r\nand thirty-seven hours of sun out of the total, day and night, of two\r\nthousand, nine hundred and fifty-two hours in the four months. As\r\ntwilight continues while the sun is less than eighteen degrees below the\r\nhorizon there is actually no darkness during this period. When the\r\ntemperature is suitable, vegetation under these conditions thrives to an\r\nalmost incredible degree, as the following shows. When I arrived at Fort\r\nMcPherson on June 20, the new buds on the trees were just perceptible,\r\nand on the evening of June 22, the trees were almost fully in leaf.\r\n\r\n“The mean minimum temperature for the month of July was 45.4° Fahr. The\r\nmean temperature for 1:30 p.m. was 64.7° Fahr., but on two occasions the\r\nthermometer went to 78° in the shade, and ten times to 70°. These\r\ntemperatures were noted along the river, at different points of course,\r\nalthough during the greater part of the month my latitude did not change\r\nvery much.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View on Peel river.]\r\n\r\n“This combination of favorable temperature and long hours of sunlight\r\npromises well for vegetable growth, but there are interfering causes.\r\nUnfortunately snow storms are apt to occur at any time during the year\r\nat Fort McPherson. On July 2, five inches of snow fell and the\r\nthermometer went down to 25° (7° below freezing point), yet, strange to\r\nsay, the frost did not appear to hurt anything. A northeast wind\r\ncontinuing for a day or more, lowers the temperature in a few hours from\r\npleasant, summer heat to what reminds one of the approach of winter.\r\n\r\n“As far as I could learn, no attempt at cultivating cereals or roots has\r\nbeen made at Fort McPherson. But at Fort Good Hope some of the people\r\ngrow potatoes and other garden produce, and, as the difference of\r\nlatitude is not much over a degree, the same things ought to grow nearly\r\nas well at Fort McPherson. The potatoes grown at Fort Good Hope are\r\nsmall, averaging about the size of a large hen’s egg. Those which I\r\ntasted were bad, as if they had been frozen, but they were of the\r\nprevious season’s growth, and it was then the middle of July. Even in\r\nOntario potatoes of that age are not very palatable. This tuber appears\r\nto have always vitality enough to increase, as at Fort Good Hope they\r\nhave had\r\n\r\n                  NO CHANGE OF SEED FOR SEVERAL YEARS.\r\n\r\nThis tends to show that the frosts are not very severe, during the time\r\npotatoes are growing and ripening. When I passed, the onions, lettuce\r\nand other things planted in the gardens were pretty well advanced, the\r\nonion stalks being about as large as pencils. No cereals had been sown,\r\nbut I think barley would succeed fairly well. I am not aware of any\r\ncontinuous record of temperature at Fort Good Hope, so I cannot say\r\nwhether the climate at that place is suitable for the growth of plants\r\nduring June, July, and August. While I was there the days were pleasant\r\nand warm and the nights not unpleasantly cool. Nor, if we omit July 2,\r\nwhen snow fell, did I anywhere note any temperature below freezing\r\nduring July and August.\r\n\r\n“It may be said that my observations extended over too great a range of\r\nlatitude, to be of any value in indicating the temperature any period or\r\nany place, as while they were being taken we were constantly moving\r\nsouth. This is true, but it must be remembered that in moving south we\r\nwere leaving the area of constant sunlight and getting to where night\r\nhas a cooling effect, so that the objection has not the same weight it\r\nwould otherwise have.\r\n\r\n“The statement given below of the duration of sunlight in the months of\r\nMay, June, July and August, serves to show that a difference in latitude\r\nhas not the same effect in changing the summer temperatures of places in\r\nhigh latitudes as it has in more southerly localities. Unfortunately,\r\nthe records at posts in the district are too few and meagre to either\r\nconfirm or disprove this theory, and to use the records of such places\r\nas Fort Franklin, on Great Bear lake, and Fort Rae, on Great Slave lake,\r\nis hardly fair. These points are over three hundred miles apart in an\r\nair line, and the temperature at either or both may be influenced by the\r\nlocal conformation of the ground, or other unknown causes. However,\r\ntaking the records at these places, we have the following comparison:—\r\n\r\n       Mean temperature        Fort Franklin,           Fort Rae,\r\n            during              lat. 65° 12′          lat. 62° 40′\r\n         May,                    35.2° Fahr.           27.7° Fahr.\r\n         June,                   51.4°                 51.4°\r\n         July,                     52°                 61.2°\r\n         August,                 50.6°                 56.5°\r\n\r\n“The Fort Franklin data are given in Professor Loomis’s Meteorology,\r\npublished in 1875. He gives as his authority Dove’s tables in the report\r\nof the British Association for 1847. Who the observer was is not stated,\r\nbut it was probably Franklin. The Fort Rae statistics were furnished by\r\nMr. Carpmael to the Senate committee appointed to inquire into the\r\nresources of Mackenzie basin, and cover the same months as those given\r\nfor Fort Franklin. These statistics, as far as they go, confirm the\r\ntheory, for the extremes at Fort Franklin differ 16.8°, while at Fort\r\nRae the difference is 33.5°, and the monthly differences at the former\r\nplace are much less than the latter.[18]\r\n\r\n“I have computed the following table which shows comprehensively the\r\ndifferent durations of sunlight for the latitudes of Ottawa, Chipewyan,\r\nand Forts Simpson, Good Hope and McPherson.\r\n\r\n               Ottawa.

This\r\ndoes not give a strictly correct result, as the sun’s declination, on\r\nwhich the length of the day depends, does not change uniformly, the\r\ndaily change in June, when the sun has attained its greatest\r\ndeclination, being small as compared with that of September, when the\r\nsun is near the equator. Were the light of each day separately computed,\r\nthe difference would be even more decidedly in favor of the north. In\r\ncomputing the above table, refraction has not been taken into account\r\nexcept in the case of Fort McPherson. Allowance for refraction would\r\nincrease the duration of sunlight at all the other places, but much more\r\nin the north than in the south. As the table now stands it assigns to\r\nFort McPherson eight hundred and thirty-two hours, or thirty-four and\r\ntwo-third days more sunlight than Ottawa, during a total period of two\r\nthousand five hundred and fifty-two hours. A better mode of comparison\r\nis to reduce the number of hours of sunlight at each place to days. It\r\nstands thus:—Ottawa, seventy-five days, five hours; Chipewyan,\r\neighty-five days, twenty hours; Fort Simpson, eighty-nine days, eleven\r\nhours; Fort Good Hope, ninety-nine days, twenty-two hours; Fort\r\nMcPherson, one hundred and nine days, twenty-one hours, and this out of\r\na total of one hundred and twenty-three days.\r\n\r\n                      AGRICULTURE AT FORT NORMAN.\r\n\r\n“At Fort Norman, the Hudson’s Bay Company had a garden planted with\r\nturnips, potatoes and other garden produce. I was at that point during\r\nthe last days of July, at which time potato vines were from six to ten\r\ninches long, and did not promise a good yield. The Roman Catholic\r\nmission had two patches, together about an acre in extent, planted with\r\npotatoes. The soil here was much better than in the first patch, being a\r\nwarm clay loam, while in the other it was nearly all decaying vegetable\r\nmatter, commonly called ‘muck’. The mission potatoes were much stronger\r\nin the vines than the Hudson’s Bay Company’s, and, at the time, nearly\r\ncovered the ground. The Anglican mission had planted a small piece of\r\nground near the river on a sheltered bench below the top of the bank and\r\nfacing the south. Here the growth was much stronger than at either of\r\nthe two other places. Some barley had been sown in it, and was well\r\ngrown, the stalks averaging from two to two and a half feet high, and\r\nthe heads being long and just beginning to fill. The growth of grass on\r\nthis flat is luxuriant, and nettles grow as strong and large as any I\r\nhave seen elsewhere. Near the edge of the woods wild vetches grow as\r\nlong and vigorous as they do near Edmonton. Everyone complained of the\r\ncold, wet weather which prevailed during the summer and much retarded\r\nvegetation. The Roman Catholic missionary in charge of the mission here,\r\ntold me that in twenty years’ residence at the place he did not\r\nrecollect such a cool, damp, cloudy summer.\r\n\r\n                            AT FORT WRIGLEY.\r\n\r\n“At Fort Wrigley some slight attempts had been made at cultivation, but\r\nI do not consider them a fair test of the capabilities of the place.\r\nWhen I was there, on August 15, the people were gathering blueberries,\r\nthen fully ripe and as large and well-flavored as they are in Ontario.\r\nRipe strawberries were found on August 9 ninety miles below this, and a\r\nfew raspberries soon afterwards. Above Fort Wrigley wild gooseberries\r\nand both red and black currants were found in abundance, some of the\r\nsmall islands being literally covered with the bushes. The gooseberries\r\nwere large and well flavored, and the currants would compare favourably\r\nwith the same fruit as cultivated in the vicinity of Ottawa, the black\r\ncurrants being especially large and mellow. This was the middle of\r\nAugust, latitude 63°.\r\n\r\n  ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FARTHER NORTH THAN OTTAWA.\r\n\r\n“At Fort Simpson the Hudson’s Bay Company has a large plot of ground\r\nplanted with turnips, potatoes, onions, and other garden produce such as\r\nis generally grown without artificial means in Ontario. On August 24,\r\nwhen I visited this place, the growing vegetables looked almost as good\r\nas the same kinds seen at the Ottawa market at the same date. Lettuce\r\nparticularly was very large and fine. There was also a large area of\r\nbarley, which looked well and promised an abundant return if allowed to\r\nripen. The grain was then full and plump and just beginning to harden,\r\nbut fears were entertained that a frost might come and spoil it. The\r\npeople there claimed that the prevailing cool, cloudy weather had\r\nretarded its growth, as otherwise it would then be out of danger from\r\nfrost. This cereal has been grown with success at Fort Simpson for many\r\nyears. I understood that wheat had been tried, but with indifferent\r\nsuccess. The garden altogether presented an appearance hardly to be\r\nexpected at a point eleven hundred and fifty miles farther north than\r\nOttawa. It is situated on an island in the river, and the presence of\r\nthe large body of water may moderate the climate and account for the\r\nfine appearance of the garden. Whether the same fine result can be\r\nattained a mile or more away from the river can only be decided by\r\ntrial. I am strongly of the opinion that it cannot.\r\n\r\n“On the high river bank below Fort Providence wild gooseberries and\r\ncurrants were very plentiful, though on the eighth of September they\r\nwere somewhat over-ripe.\r\n\r\n“At Fort Providence the usual garden produce is grown every year and\r\ngenerally turns out well. Barley is also grown with success, but in 1888\r\nit was, as everywhere else in the valley, much retarded by cool weather.\r\nUp to my departure from the post, the lowest temperature, exclusive of\r\nJuly 2, was 31.8° on August 29. The mean minimum for the month of August\r\nwas 43°. When I was at Fort Providence the barley was beginning to\r\nchange color, and, unless a very severe frost came soon after, would\r\nripen. Wheat has been grown here for many years by the Hudson’s Bay\r\nCompany, generally being fairly ripe before it is touched by frost and\r\nsometimes escaping altogether. The wheat is ground in a small hand mill,\r\nand the flour used in the ordinary way by the people of the fort. While\r\nthere I ground a few pounds of the crop of 1887, and had the flour made\r\ninto a cake, which, though not quite so good as that made from ‘XXXX’\r\nflour, was palatable, and would probably sustain life as effectually as\r\nany other, those using it appearing as well and strong as could be\r\ndesired. I brought home a sample of this wheat for inspection.\r\n\r\n                  PEA VINES STILL GREEN IN SEPTEMBER.\r\n\r\n“At Fort Resolution the Hudson’s Bay Company were growing potatoes,\r\nturnips and barley. The first were of good quality and size, but there\r\nwould be no yield of the last. The Anglican missionary also had a garden\r\nin which were potatoes, cabbage, cauliflowers, turnips, onions and peas,\r\nthe latter still green on September 21. The potatoes and cauliflowers\r\nwere both good in size and flavor. I was informed that small potatoes\r\nwere grown in a garden at Fort Rae, situated on a long arm of Great\r\nSlave lake, but, according to report, there is not much land around the\r\nlake available for farming, even were the climate suitable, as it is\r\nnearly all rock. At Fort Smith nothing of importance from an\r\nagricultural point of view had been done, and the autumn frosts were\r\nvery severe.\r\n\r\n“In conclusion, I may say that I do not wish to be understood as\r\nrepresenting this country as suitable for agricultural operations, as I\r\ndo not think it is. I have merely presented the results of the attempts\r\nwhich have been made. These results are doubtless much more favorable\r\nthan might be expected, but how far they would hold good elsewhere than\r\nin the immediate vicinity of the river is not known. It is probable that\r\nthe presence of such a large body of water, with a temperature of about\r\n55°, has a beneficial influence on vegetation.\r\n\r\n“Before that part of our territory will be required for settlement,\r\nthere will be ample time to determine by experiment exactly what it is\r\nworth for agriculture.\r\n\r\n                         EUROPEAN COMPARISONS.\r\n\r\n“In looking over the world for countries lying in the same latitude to\r\ncompare with it, we find Norway extending from latitude 58° to 70° 30′,\r\nwith an area of one hundred and twenty-three thousand two hundred and\r\nsix square miles, and a population of one million eight hundred and six\r\nthousand nine hundred. Of her territory only about one-thirtieth is\r\nunder cultivation, one-fourth being covered with forest, and the rest\r\nbarren mountain land. But as Norway is exposed throughout its whole\r\nlength to Atlantic ocean, the comparison is hardly apposite. Better\r\nsuited for comparison is that division of Russia known as Finland, lying\r\nbetween 60° and 70° north latitude, with an area of one hundred and\r\nforty-four thousand two hundred and fifty-four square miles, and a\r\npopulation of two million one hundred and forty-two thousand and\r\nninety-three.\r\n\r\n“This shows us that we must not regard the district as altogether\r\nuseless nor despair of its ultimate occupation to at least the same\r\nextent as the countries named. When we take into consideration also the\r\nadaptability to settlement of Athabaska and Peace river valleys, which\r\nare parts of the same great drainage basin, we may look forward with\r\nconfidence to its ultimate occupation by several millions of\r\ninhabitants.”\r\n\r\nIn the report of his trip in 1891, Mr. Ogilvie gives the following notes\r\non agriculture in Mackenzie valley:—\r\n\r\n“Fort Providence was infested with grasshoppers to such an extent that\r\nevery bit of grain sown there was cut to the ground, nothing but the\r\nstubs of the stalks being visible. Wheat has been grown there with\r\nvarying success for many years, and the fact that in latitude 61° 20′\r\n38′′ it has been completely devoured by grasshoppers is itself worthy of\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\n“At Simpson the garden stuff, although very nice in appearance, was not\r\nup to what I saw there in 1888, just at the same time of the year too,\r\nthough it would compare very favourably with the appearance of those in\r\nplaces ten and fifteen degrees farther south. At that date (August 25 to\r\n28), garden stuff was well advanced, green peas were in use, as were\r\ncabbage, potatoes, carrots and other vegetables, all large and well\r\nflavoured. The barley sown was short and stunted looking from drought,\r\nbut of fair quality.\r\n\r\n“In 1888 the Company’s officer in charge planted ash-leaved maples sent\r\nin from Manitoba to see how they would stand the climate, eleven degrees\r\nfarther north than their native home. Last year they were quite large\r\nand seemed to flourish as well as they would have done in their native\r\nsoil. Many head of cattle were kept here, which seem to thrive as well\r\nas they would anywhere else in our country. The hay for their winter\r\nsubsistence is cut on the hills south of the fort.\r\n\r\n                           AT LIARD IN 1891.\r\n\r\n“At Fort Liard the same drought seems to have prevailed, and prevented\r\nthe usual development of what was planted. At the date (September 4) of\r\nmy arrival, the barley had been harvested some days, and though the\r\nstraw was short the grain was plump and hard and of fair yield. Potatoes\r\nwere of good size and of fair quality. Wheat had often been grown here\r\nsuccessfully, but as it can only be used whole, it is considered better\r\nto grow barley, which can be, and is, used as cattle food. Cattle are\r\nkept here, and seem to thrive as well as they do in other places of the\r\ncountry. At this post the soil is a rich, black loamy clay, and the\r\nsurface is thickly wooded all around. As seen from the high ground on\r\nthe opposite side of the river, the country to the south and east\r\nappears undulating, rising into extensive ridges all heavily wooded.\r\nThis condition is said to continue through to Hay river. In the valley\r\nare many lakes, some of considerable extent, and many large swamps. I\r\ncould not learn anything of the character of the soil, but it is fair to\r\nassume from the general character of the woods, that it is of fair\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n“While at this fort I examined the daily journal of events kept at every\r\npost, for the purpose of getting some information as to the times of the\r\ngeneral run of farming events, opening or closing of the river, or any\r\nother fact of agricultural, meteorological, or general interest. I will\r\nhere make a few explanatory remarks with regard to these journals. It is\r\na standing rule in the Company’s service that a journal of daily events\r\nbe kept at every post, but each officer seems to have a different idea\r\nof what a daily journal even is, and there seems to be a want of\r\ncontinuity, so to speak, in the records when there is a change of\r\nwriters or officers, some officers aiming at making it what it was\r\nintended or ought to be, a chronicle which could at any time hereafter\r\nbe consulted with confidence regarding historical, meteorological and\r\nagricultural events in particular, and information generally.\r\nUnfortunately, many seem to have considered it an unpleasant duty, and\r\nput it off from day to day, until a long interval had elapsed, then went\r\nat it in desperation and made the best record they could from memory, of\r\ncourse often omitting many items of interest and general importance. In\r\nmany of the journals I have seen there are great gaps, the officer at\r\nthe place being absent on a journey, or sick or otherwise unable to\r\nwrite the journal at the post.\r\n\r\n                       NOTES FROM LIARD JOURNALS.\r\n\r\nThe journals at Liard gave me the following dates and facts:—\r\n\r\n    1878.

Planted seed April 16; reaped barley, omitted; first ice\r\n    in river October 28; ice set fast November 14.\r\n\r\n    1890. Planted seed April 30; reaped barley, omitted; first ice\r\n    in river October 15; ice set fast November 14.\r\n\r\n    Potatoes are generally harvested about September 20. The ice\r\n    generally breaks up in the river about May 1.\r\n\r\n                    BETWEEN THE LIARD AND THE PEACE.\r\n\r\n“On the west side of Liard and East Branch rivers it is not very far to\r\nthe mountains, consequently the area of land which might be utilized\r\nagriculturally is not very extensive on that side. On the east the same\r\ncharacter of surface holds I believe from the Liard southward to the\r\nPeace watershed, high dry ridges with many intervening swamps and lakes,\r\nmany of the swamps being very extensive. This is as the Indians and one\r\nor two white men who have made journeys into it have said of it. The\r\nsoil is generally of fair quality, some of it good. On my return from\r\nSikanni Chief river to Peace river I found the same general\r\ncharacteristics, ridges with swamps between. I am afraid the elevation\r\nabove the sea level along this route (the average reading of the\r\nbarometer being about 27.00 inches while I was on it) is too high to\r\nallow farming in the sense in which we understand it. On the streams\r\nflowing into the Peace, there is much prairie, but it is confined mainly\r\nto the immediate valleys of the streams; much of it is springy and wet,\r\nevidently the water from the adjacent swamps percolating through. The\r\nsoil is all good, and if the climatic conditions were suitable, a very\r\nlarge percentage of good country would be found in this section. Many of\r\nthe swamps could be drained as the natural facilities for drainage are\r\ngood. Although it was in October I passed over it I witnessed no severe\r\nfrosts, very little ice being visible anywhere, and the flora giving no\r\nevidence of having been much injured by the frosts. In the prairies\r\nalong the creeks, the grasses and plants are generally of as luxuriant\r\ngrowth as in places much farther south and east. The grass was generally\r\nlong and meadow-like, but as we approached Peace river it became more\r\nlike true prairie grass, until extensive areas of true prairie were\r\npassed over along the tributaries of Peace river.\r\n\r\n“The weather for some days previous to my arrival at Nelson (September\r\n15) had been showery and unsettled; this culminated on September 16 in a\r\nvery heavy rainfall which changed to snow on September 17 and 18. This\r\nwas damp and stuck to and loaded the trees in the forest to such an\r\nextent that the weight broke thousands of them. The snowstorm appears to\r\nhave been local, as I afterwards learned that it had not extended to\r\nPeace river nor more than one hundred miles south from Nelson. The\r\nweather cleared on September 19.”\r\n\r\nIn a communication to the press in 1910, Mr. Ogilvie wrote:—“From Fort\r\nVermilion to Fort Liard on Liard river, where wheat has been\r\nsuccessfully grown for more years than many people would credit, is\r\nthree hundred and ten miles; by trail, say three hundred and fifty. On\r\nthis stretch just across Peace river Hay river prairies are highly\r\nspoken of, and certainly look well from the river. A railway line would\r\nprobably follow down Black river valley to Liard, and extensive meadows\r\nin this valley were reported by natives when I was there in 1891.”\r\n\r\n               EVIDENCE BEFORE THE LATE SENATE COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\nThe select committee of the Senate of Canada which sat in 1907 devoted\r\nconsiderable attention to the agricultural possibilities of Mackenzie\r\nvalley. Mr. R. G. McConnell of the Geological Survey was examined before\r\nthe committee and said he did not happen to be in places where there was\r\nany farming going on, but was at Fort Providence in the autumn and\r\nwintered there one winter, and ate potatoes, turnips and other\r\nvegetables like that all winter that had been grown there. That is north\r\nof Great Slave lake. Going down the Mackenzie, Mr. McConnell explained,\r\nonce you get away from the river flat you get into a rolling country\r\npartly with muskeg, with hard ridges between. The only possible part of\r\nthat country suitable for agriculture, he thought, would be the large\r\nflats down Mackenzie river. It is a wide valley, but there is the same\r\nthing there: you never know exactly beforehand what is going to happen.\r\nCertainly it does not look like a favourable country for agriculture\r\nonce you get away from the river.\r\n\r\nThe prairie on Liard river is a little north of the 60th degree of\r\nlatitude. There is a lot of marsh hay growing around Great Slave lake.\r\nIt would be good for feeding stock. Along Great Slave lake itself there\r\nis a large tract of flat country which may come in some time. Most of\r\nthe grass Mr. McConnell saw there was a heavy marsh grass. It is not\r\njointed, though there is some of that kind. He remembered seeing patches\r\nof it on Hay river.\r\n\r\nAsked as to the extent of good agricultural land in the country, Mr.\r\nMcConnell said it depended on what was called good agricultural country.\r\nHe knew that at Fort Good Hope, right down on the circle, they can raise\r\ngood potatoes, because he saw them, and there is no reason why they\r\ncannot raise vegetables all the way down the Mackenzie as far north as\r\nthat. The land on both sides of the river suitable for agriculture does\r\nnot extend far. There are flats two or three miles wide—bottom flats of\r\nthe Mackenzie a mile to a mile and a half wide. Once you get up out of\r\nthe valley the country is rolling and partly muskeg. There is a large\r\ntract of that sort of country extending as far north as Fort Good Hope.\r\nIt is about a thousand miles altogether from Great Slave lake to the\r\nsea, and that flat would be six or eight hundred miles in length.\r\n\r\n                          INTENSE SUMMER HEAT.\r\n\r\nMr. Elihu Stewart (See p. 136), describing his trip to the far north\r\nbefore the Senate committee of 1907, said that after leaving Lake\r\nAthabaska there is rock along the Athabaska, but there are plains, said\r\nto be good land, extending from Slave lake down to Peace river. Below\r\nFort Smith there is a deposit of alluvial soil very similar in\r\nappearance and in character to that of the prairie, extending as far as\r\nRocky mountains, below Fort Simpson, and even along the valley then all\r\nthe way down as far as Mr. Stewart went. It was a surprise to him. Mr.\r\nStewart was at Fort Providence on July 15, 1906. Fort Providence is near\r\nSlave lake, on Mackenzie river, in latitude 61·25°. This is nine hundred\r\nand seventeen miles by travelled route from Athabaska, but, as near as\r\nMr. Stewart could calculate it, about five hundred and fifty miles\r\nfarther north than Edmonton. He saw there on July 15 wheat in the milk,\r\npotatoes in flower, peas fit for use, tomatoes, turnips, rhubarb, beets,\r\ncabbage, onions, and other garden vegetables. The tomatoes were not\r\nfully formed, and Mr. Stewart did not think they ripened. They grew them\r\nunder glass. The strawberries ripen at any time; in fact they had ripe\r\nstrawberries before that, also raspberries, currants, gooseberries and\r\nsaskatoons. The wheat that Mr. Stewart saw there was just in milk. He\r\ninquired when it was sown, and was told May 20. It seemed incredible,\r\nuntil it was remembered that there is scarcely any darkness during\r\nsummer there. There were about twenty hours’ sun each day, and the heat\r\nwas greater for several days than anything Mr. Stewart had ever\r\nexperienced in Ottawa. Along the lower Athabaska and at Chipewyan, Mr.\r\nStewart and his fellow travellers had it over one hundred in the shade\r\nfor several days. There was a thermometer on the steamer in the shade.\r\nPerhaps the heat was greater on the boat than it would have been ashore.\r\nCertainly it was exceedingly hot weather, and continued all night. There\r\nwas very little night at that time. The hot wave extended down to the\r\nArctic sea as Mr. Stewart ascertained from Indians who had come from\r\nRampart House, near the Alaskan boundary, to meet the steamer, the\r\n“Wrigley.” He returned with them instead of coming back with the boat,\r\nand they lost two of their dogs from the heat, and that in the Arctic\r\ncircle. From his observations along the river, that portion of the\r\nMackenzie he travelled through presented a better appearance than\r\nAthabaska basin. He did not see much hay around Slave lake. He was not\r\ntravelling through the country there.\r\n\r\n           NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILES NORTH OF EDMONTON.\r\n\r\nFort Good Hope, in latitude 66·16°, is nine hundred and seventy miles\r\nfarther north than Edmonton, yet Mr. Stewart saw cabbages, onions and\r\nother garden vegetables growing in the gardens there. Beyond Fort Good\r\nHope the frost is so near the surface of the ground that it is pretty\r\nhard to raise anything. At Fort Macpherson, and in that neighbourhood\r\nwhere the portage is crossed, there is frozen soil. The vegetables at\r\nFort Good Hope looked as good as any others. The soil there was very\r\nfertile. The fort which is nearest to the mouth of the Mackenzie is\r\n“Point Separation.” It is not on the Mackenzie, and was so named because\r\nit was there that Sir John Franklin and Doctor Richardson separated on\r\nFranklin’s memorable second trip. There were no evidences of vegetation\r\nalong the river that far north that would lead the witness to conclude\r\nthat agriculture could be carried on there. As far as Fort Good Hope, on\r\nthis side of that place, and around Providence the country is a fine\r\none. It is a wooded country.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Stewart’s 1906 official report (p. 13) he writes:—“On July 15,\r\nthe garden at Fort Providence (latitude 61·4°) contained peas fit for\r\nuse, potatoes in flower, tomatoes, rhubarb, beets, cabbages, onions.\r\nBesides vegetables, there were cultivated flowers and fruits such as red\r\ncurrants, gooseberries, strawberries, raspberries and saskatoons. But\r\nmost surprising thing of all was a small field of wheat in the milk, the\r\ngrain being fully formed.” This was stated to have been sown on May 20\r\nand harvested before July 28, slightly over two months from sowing.\r\n\r\n                      SIT OUT ALL NIGHT AND READ.\r\n\r\nMr. H. A. Conroy of the Indian Department (See p. 136) informed the\r\nSenate committee that he had been down at Fort Providence mission in\r\n1902. The missionaries had a splendid farm about latitude 62·30°, and he\r\nsaw beautiful crops of wheat, oats, barley and peas. He left there on\r\nJuly 28, and their barley was fit to cut, and they were cutting it.\r\nTheir oats and wheat would be ready to cut in a day or two from the\r\nlooks of it, and the priest later told him all their grain was cut\r\nwithout a bit of frost. They have lots of sunlight. One could sit out\r\nall night and read. The altitude is low, and you can see the reflection\r\nof the sunset and sunrise.\r\n\r\nW. F. Bredin, M.L.A., (See p. 104) in his evidence before the committee,\r\nremarked that the southern shore of Great Slave lake seems to have good\r\nagricultural prospects. One notable place there is Hay river. There they\r\nraise barley and all the common vegetables. At the mouth of Great Slave\r\nriver and at the mouths of all the rivers running in there, large\r\nquantities of hay grow. In fact there is a very rank growth of grass\r\nalong all those streams as far north as one likes to go. Where the\r\nground along the river is not covered with trees, grass grows. At Fort\r\nProvidence, about forty miles down the Mackenzie from Great Slave lake,\r\nthey raise barley and all the vegetables every year, and some years\r\nwheat and oats.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and seventy miles below, north of Fort Providence, is Fort\r\nSimpson, where Liard river comes in. The Hudson’s Bay Company for many\r\nyears have raised barley and vegetables at that point. In some years\r\nthey might raise wheat, but not every year. At all those Hudson’s Bay\r\nCompany’s posts they always raise vegetables. They do not pretend to\r\nraise any other grain regularly but barley, because\r\n\r\n                       THEY USE BARLEY FOR SOUPS.\r\n\r\nThey pound the hull of it in a hollow piece of wood and use the grain\r\nfor soups. At Fort Simpson he saw cauliflowers, cabbages and cucumbers\r\ngrowing under exactly the same conditions as they would grow them in\r\nnorthern Alberta. The cucumbers were simply planted in a hotbed, and\r\nallowed to remain there protected in the early spring from the frost,\r\nand then allowed to grow in the hotbeds, with the sashes off, in the\r\nsummer time.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and forty miles north of Fort Simpson is Fort Wrigley (north\r\nlatitude 63°). That is where Mr. Bredin stated he once wintered. In the\r\nspring they put in a garden there. The Hudson’s Bay Company officials\r\nplant gardens every year at that point. The spring that Mr. Bredin was\r\nthere they got their seed potatoes from Fort Good Hope, which is\r\nfourteen miles south of the Arctic circle. They went there for seed\r\nbecause they had none, having used up theirs during the winter. Mr.\r\nBredin saw those potatoes. They were a played-out seed, a white-blue\r\nvariety. They were not the improved potatoes but they were a fair size.\r\nThey had the same class of potatoes at Hay river, but since that they\r\ngot in new seed (the Early Rover) from outside, and they grow very much\r\nbetter crops. The season at Wrigley is quite long enough, because the\r\nsun shines there during all the growing season. That is the great secret\r\nof the growth in that country. There is not much fertile land at\r\nWrigley. Down there Rocky mountains are on both sides of the river, and\r\nthere is a great deal of muskeg. The garden at Fort Wrigley\r\n\r\n                         WAS ORIGINALLY MUSKEG\r\n\r\nand covered with moss. As soon as the timber is cut off a muskeg the\r\nmoss dies, the frost comes out of the ground, and gardens can be\r\ncultivated. The trees throw out their leaves in Mackenzie basin about\r\nthe middle of May, before the ice goes out of the river. The year Mr.\r\nBredin was there the ice went out of the Mackenzie at Fort Wrigley on\r\nMay 23, and the trees were all out in leaf before that time. On\r\nMackenzie river the trees leaf out almost in a few hours. The quickness\r\nwith which the leaves appear on the trees in the spring is simply\r\nmarvellous.\r\n\r\nMr. Bredin was never up Liard valley, but heard a great deal about it at\r\nFort Simpson, and he had seen the journals of the Hudson’s Bay Company\r\nthat were kept at Fort Liard, two hundred miles up Liard river. From\r\nthese sources he gathered that they raised all the cereals there, such\r\nas wheat, oats and barley, as well as all the vegetables of the commoner\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nMr. Bredin informed the committee that the spring he was at Fort Wrigley\r\nthe months of March and April were the finest he ever saw. He was there\r\njust one spring, and it was as pleasant weather as he ever saw in his\r\nnative province of Ontario, for those two months, while the winters were\r\nno worse than he had seen them in Manitoba. Mackenzie river closed on\r\nNovember 19 that year and there was a little snow then—and it lasted\r\nuntil March. Practically all the snow went off the latter part of March.\r\n\r\nMr. Edward A. Preble of the United States Biological Survey (See p. 22),\r\nspeaking of his trip down the Mackenzie in 1904, states that the country\r\nabout Fort Providence is level and is mainly grown up to poplars\r\n(_Populus tremuloides_). Back from the river are many muskegs, with\r\ntheir characteristic tamarack and spruce forests. The Roman Catholic\r\nmission established is now one of the largest in the north. The Hudson’s\r\nBay Company’s post was established there in 1868, and the post at Big\r\nisland was abandoned. Both establishments cultivate large fields of\r\npotatoes and the various root crops.\r\n\r\nMr. Preble reports that on June 17, below Fort Norman, a small quantity\r\nof snow fell. On June 21, at Fort Good Hope, the leaves on most of the\r\ntrees were about half grown. On the same date the sun was visible at\r\nmidnight from a low hill near the post, and many birds were in full song\r\nat that hour. For the next three weeks, north of this point, the sun was\r\ncontinually above the horizon. Vegetation now advanced rather faster\r\nthan Mr. Preble’s rate of travel northward, but was not at its height\r\nwhen he reached the delta of the Mackenzie on June 30.\r\n\r\n                     UNITED STATES OFFICIAL REPORT.\r\n\r\nMr. Preble in his published report (North American Fauna No. 27)\r\npresents a map of the Northland, showing the “life zone.” What he calls\r\n“the Canadian zone” extends from the southern margin of the map to an\r\nirregular line trending in a northwesterly direction from a point about\r\n52·30° north latitude, just south of Hudson bay, to a point about 58·30°\r\nnorth latitude at Rocky mountains. The main irregularity in the course\r\nof the northern boundary of this zone is due to a wedge shaped\r\nprojection into the zone to the north, due to the well known northern\r\ntrend of the isothermal lines from a point in eastern Saskatchewan. The\r\nline from about longitude 150° runs direct across Lake Athabaska,\r\ncutting it in half practically, then to the mouth of Slave river on\r\nGreat Slave lake, thence in a sweep to where the 65th parallel of north\r\nlatitude strikes the Mackenzie. Thence the line runs back southeast to\r\nthe Liard, following that stream to the western margin of the map.\r\n\r\nNorth of the “Canadian” zone, the “Hudsonian” zone is represented, its\r\nnorthern limit being an irregular line running northwesterly from north\r\nlatitude 55·11° on Hudson bay to the delta of the Mackenzie. This zone\r\nis represented as extending northward in wedge shaped projections for\r\nsome distance down the valley of the Dubawnt, down that of the\r\nCoppermine, and into the lake country north of Great Bear lake. All of\r\nthe country north of this is described by Mr. Preble as the “Arctic\r\nzone.”\r\n\r\nMr. Preble remarks in his report:—“The northern border of the Canadian\r\nzone in the Mackenzie region limits the successful cultivation of\r\nbarley, potatoes, and the more hardy root crops, although with special\r\ncare most of them are raised in certain favoured localities in the\r\nsouthern part of the Hudsonian. Even in the Canadian, however, an\r\noccasional failure occurs, in the case of the less hardy crops, because\r\nof the occurrence of unusually late spring or early autumn frosts. In\r\nmost parts of Peace river valley, and even in lower Liard valley, wheat\r\nis a successful crop. Peas, potatoes, radishes, turnips, beets, carrots,\r\ncabbages, lettuce and onions are raised with a considerable degree of\r\nsuccess as far north as Fort Norman, near latitude 65°, near the\r\nnorthern extremity of the Canadian strip. Nearly all of these meet with\r\na fair amount of success at Fort Rae and also at Fort Good Hope, in the\r\nlower Hudsonian, but at Fort Rae the situation is specially favourable\r\nas regards slope exposure, and the permanent frost, which remains near\r\nthe surface in most parts of the Hudsonian, probably retreats to a much\r\nlower depth. At Fort Good Hope the almost continuous sunlight of summer\r\nprobably compensates in part for its extreme northern position.”\r\n\r\nThe importance of these extracts from Mr. Preble’s report lies in the\r\nfact that this is an official report of a trained, scientific explorer\r\nwho has lived in the north country for months, who has travelled\r\nextensively, and whose sole object as a responsible salaried official of\r\na foreign country is to provide indisputable data for scientific study.\r\n\r\n                   AN ENGLISH TRAVELLER’S TESTIMONY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Eskimos in Kyaks on Arctic Red river.]\r\n\r\nMr. Alfred H. Harrison, the English traveller and explorer (See p. 22),\r\nin his volume “In Search of a Polar Continent” relates that just as he\r\nwas leaving Fort Simpson in 1905 for the descent of the lower Mackenzie\r\n“Père Vacher appeared with a sack of potatoes which he had grown in his\r\nown garden, and which were as good as any we can get at home.”\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Harrison reached the post at the mouth of Arctic Red river on\r\nOctober 4, he found that that tributary had been frozen fast for three\r\nweeks, and it was reported that a few miles lower down the Mackenzie\r\nitself was ice-locked.\r\n\r\nIn his account of his return trip up the Mackenzie in 1907, Mr. Harrison\r\nwrites (p. 268):—“On July 25 we arrived at Fort Good Hope, where I was\r\nglad once more, to meet Mr. Gaudet, who, it will be remembered, was in\r\ncharge of this post. I was particularly impressed here by the gardens\r\nwhich I visited. They produced fine crops of nearly every kind of\r\nvegetable that we grow at home. I did not, indeed, see either pease or\r\nbeans, but I noted how very fine the potatoes and cabbages were, as also\r\nthe onions, beet root, lettuces, and turnips. We took some of these\r\nvegetables on board, and they tasted every whit as good as they looked”.\r\n\r\nMr. Harrison devotes several pages of his book to what he describes as\r\nthe commercial geography of the country extending from Athabaska to the\r\ndelta of the Mackenzie. He writes:—\r\n\r\n                   AS TO ILLINOIS, IOWA AND MISSOURI.\r\n\r\n“The natural resources of this country are very great. I remember once\r\nhearing my father say that the states of Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri\r\nwere commonly believed, when he was a young man, to be barren wastes,\r\nwhere agriculture was impossible, and where no white men could live, but\r\nthat by the few who knew of the capabilities of that region great hopes\r\nwere entertained of its future. To-day these very states are the most\r\nproductive in the Union. In like manner one might be tempted to hazard a\r\nprophecy as to the importance and prosperity of that country, so vast,\r\nbut so little known, which lies to the north of the new province of\r\nAlberta; and, accordingly, I will venture briefly to submit an estimate\r\nof the commercial prospects of what may well be a career of immense\r\nindustrial expansion which seems to await the great region now known as\r\nMackenzie river basin.\r\n\r\n“Canada, be it remembered, has an area greater than that of the United\r\nStates, and at the last census (that of 1901) the smaller country showed\r\na population of eighty millions, as against the mere five millions at\r\nwhich the larger was registered. If, therefore, the resources of the\r\nlarger of these two countries are relatively as great, the scantier\r\npopulation will admit of being increased fifteen times. The question of\r\nresources thereupon emerges, and before speaking of these in detail, it\r\nmay be noted (1) that the soil here is as good as in other parts of the\r\nDominion; and (2) that the winters are not more severe than those which\r\nare undergone in other portions of Canada. Six months, moreover, of open\r\nwater may be reckoned upon—from the beginning of May to the beginning\r\nof November. The lakes and rivers abound with fish; there are inconnu,\r\nor Mackenzie salmon, whitefish, pike, and suckers, doré, trout, and\r\nherrings. The large inland sheets of water—such as Great and Lesser\r\nSlave lakes, Athabaska and Bear lakes—teem with fish, which forms\r\nto-day the staple food of the scanty inmates of these tracts. The\r\nfishing, indeed, would of itself be no slight asset were there any means\r\nof shipping the produce out of the country.\r\n\r\n“This brings me to the subject of transport. Population will not merely\r\nincrease with, but will itself enable the increase of,\r\n\r\n                      THE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION.\r\n\r\nThe two will advance, like a couple of boys playing at leap-frog, each\r\nby the aid of the other—and will advance, like those youngsters, ‘by\r\nleaps and bounds.’ As the settlers become more frequent the great\r\nwaterways will be rendered navigable, and their banks, like the land\r\nabutting the railways that will make a trellis-work of the country, will\r\nbe dotted with noble cities and with prosperous towns. There are at the\r\npresent day three huge tracts that would quickly be inhabited were they\r\ninvaded by the locomotive. A railroad from Edmonton to Athabaska river\r\nwould give access to two hundred and ten miles of waterway, in one\r\ndirection, up to Lesser Slave lake, and one hundred and sixty-five miles\r\nof stream running down to Grand rapids. A railroad from Edmonton to\r\nPeace river would open up six hundred miles of a river yet finer, and\r\nrunning through a finer country, than that approached by the first-named\r\nline. The third railway to be looked for would connect Athabaska river\r\nat McMurray with Prince Albert, hereby giving easy access to the\r\nname-sake lake from this fort.\r\n\r\n“It might be objected that there are no markets in this country, but\r\nthis objection we have already virtually forestalled. Given the spread\r\nof railways and the inflow of settlers, the establishment of markets\r\nwill follow as a matter of course. Let me conclude my statement of the\r\ncountry’s capabilities by mentioning its lime and stone, its oil and\r\ngas, its asphaltum, coal, and salt.\r\n\r\n“In cherishing these sanguine hopes as to its future, I do not think I\r\nam alone. They are shared by a few who have gone off the beaten tracks,\r\nand made themselves acquainted with the country. When the immensity of\r\nthese northern lands is realized, one cannot wonder that few men should\r\nbe familiar with them. In my travels there I have met with only one man\r\nwho really knows the country from end to end, and if asked whether he\r\ndid so, he would doubtless answer that he did not. I refer to Mr. Conroy\r\n(of the Indian Department) who has traversed its entire length year\r\nafter year, has departed from the beaten tracks, and has in many places\r\npenetrated far into the interior. How, then, in the absence of railways,\r\ncan men whose enterprise and qualifications are less eminent than his\r\nobtain in a lifetime an adequate knowledge of this outlying region?”\r\n\r\n                        MOUNTED POLICE REPORTS.\r\n\r\nWe get some interesting information regarding unknown or little known\r\nsections of the Mackenzie country from recent reports of the Royal\r\nNorthwest Mounted Police.\r\n\r\nInspector Jarvis, C.M.G., in the report of one of his patrols in 1907\r\ninto the wood buffalo country about Fort Smith and the Little Buffalo,\r\nwrote:—“We went westerly from Fort Smith through a level dry country,\r\ncovered with jackpine and poplar for about nine miles, following nearly\r\nthe course of Slave river to Gravel point, where we turned southwesterly\r\nthrough a region of swamps and muskegs for nine miles more. This brought\r\nus to Salt river where we camped for the night. The next day we went\r\nnorthwesterly along the banks of Salt river, in a region of extensive\r\nprairies, some of them wet, some dry, but all covered with a fine growth\r\nof grass and capable of supplying unlimited quantities of hay. After\r\nthree miles we came to the crossing of Salt river, and went up the\r\nthickly wooded slope of Salt mountain, which is here, as farther south,\r\na plateau of no great elevation. From there on the country was\r\nbeautiful, the ground was slightly rolling with occasional lakes, the\r\nsoil rich, and the timber, spruce, poplar, jackpine and tamarack. The\r\npasture was of the richest description, so that the horses fared well in\r\nspite of the swarms of the mosquitoes and bulldogs (flies). We now left\r\nthe mountain to cross this open stretch and at noon reached the east\r\nside of this prairie, where we camped. Thence forward we travelled\r\nthrough dry poplar woods of scattered large trees, under which the\r\nrichest grass abounded. The whole of this region seemed ideal for stock.\r\nAbout 3 p.m. we once more reached Salt river, and followed its banks\r\nthrough the same dry poplar country to its junction with Slave river,\r\nwhich we reached at six o’clock. A boat was handy so we put all baggage\r\nin this, and swam the horses, camping for the night. On June 28 we broke\r\ncamp at 8 a.m. and rode southerly for two miles through a dense growth\r\nof spruce, varied with a few stumps. This gave place to the open poplar\r\nwoods with rich pasture which continued for seven miles, bringing us to\r\nGravel point.\r\n\r\n“There is a good deal of swamp in this region. There is, however, much\r\nland that is dry, rich, and eminently suited for ranching and mixed\r\nfarming.”\r\n\r\nThe inspector relates how, northeast of Little Buffalo river, “we came\r\nto the top of the mountain and had a clear view of a great extent of\r\ncountry below us. To the north were some muskegs, but northeast were the\r\nopen plains of Salt river stretching away for many miles.”\r\n\r\n                             LIARD IN 1909.\r\n\r\nSergeant (at that date Corporal) A. H. L. Mellor, Royal Northwest\r\nMounted Police, made a patrol from Smith Landing to Fort Liard in 1909.\r\nIn his report he says:—“Fort Liard enjoys a much more temperate climate\r\nthan this country (Fort Smith) and splendid gardens are raised there.\r\nThe Roman Catholic mission has been growing wheat and barley there for a\r\nconsiderable time, always with success. I am sending herewith a sample\r\nof their last year’s wheat.”\r\n\r\nSergeant Mellor ascended Buffalo river from Great Slave lake in 1910 and\r\nmade detours inland on foot at several points for the purpose of getting\r\nsome idea of the nature of the country, and found the whole region to be\r\nof a swampy nature, with here and there a sandy stretch. Along the\r\nsouthern shore of Buffalo lake is a “dreary muskeg country, thicketed\r\nwith dwarf spruce and riddled with innumerable streams of water, both\r\nsulphur and clear.”\r\n\r\n                       HAY RIVER AND RESOLUTION.\r\n\r\nSergeant R. Field, in charge of the Chipewyan sub-district, under date\r\nAugust, 1909, reported:—“The gardens at Hay river and Resolution look\r\nvery promising, especially the potato crop. The Reverend Vale at Hay\r\nriver informed me that he grew one thousand bushels of potatoes last\r\nyear on three acres of land, and also splendid cabbages and\r\ncauliflowers, besides all other kinds of vegetables. The potato crop at\r\nChipewyan is going to be very poor this year owing to the extremely hot\r\nweather and very little rain.”\r\n\r\nIn his annual report for 1910-11, Superintendent G. E. Sanders, D.S.O.,\r\ncommanding at Athabaska, gives this interesting reference:—“As regards\r\nweather conditions the winter of 1910-11 was one of the coldest known,\r\nthe thermometer at different times in January and February registering\r\n60° below zero at Athabaska, Lesser Slave lake and Fort Vermilion. In\r\nthe far north the same months were cold, but the thermometer did not go\r\nas low, 58° being the severest at Fort McPherson and 40° at Herschell\r\nisland. Forty below on the coast, however, would be much more trying\r\nthan 60° below inland. It is interesting to note that Athabaska river\r\nand Mackenzie river, one thousand eight hundred miles farther north,\r\nfroze over within four days of each other, the former on November 8 and\r\nthe latter on November 4. The ice left the Athabaska on April 22, and\r\nthe Mackenzie on May 13.”\r\n\r\n                     TO THE EAST OF THE MACKENZIE.\r\n\r\nIt will no doubt be remarked that so far very little has been said with\r\nreference to arable land and agriculture in that section of the\r\nterritory to which this chapter is devoted, east of the actual valley of\r\nMackenzie river itself. This is easily explained.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, except at Fort Rae on the north arm of Great Slave\r\nlake, no attempts at practical agriculture have been made in the eastern\r\ndivision of the region being treated of, for there are no posts there.\r\nFort Confidence and Fort Franklin on Great Bear lake, and Fort\r\nEnterprise near the head waters of the Coppermine, were never ordinary\r\ntrading posts, being merely winter headquarters, deserted by their\r\ntenants as soon as travelling was practicable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Staff and pupils, Church of England Mission, Hay river.]\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the question of the country’s agricultural\r\npossibilities have not been considered by the few lightly equipped\r\nexplorers who have hurried through sections of it intent upon some\r\nspecial mission or other. The only references we find in the journals of\r\nsuch travellers as have ventured through this region in summer, are such\r\nas we get in Mr. Preble’s account of his trip via the lake, river and\r\nportage route from Great Slave lake to Great Bear lake, when he states\r\nthat on August 24 “Currants (_Ribes rubrum_ and _prostratum_) were\r\nabundant and ripe” along the route.\r\n\r\nDoctor Richardson (See p. 13), commenting upon the observations made by\r\nhimself and colleagues of the Franklin expedition at Fort Franklin at\r\nthe southwest corner of Great Bear lake, gives the following notes\r\nregarding the progression of the seasons:—“The relative temperatures of\r\nDecember, January, and February differ considerably; any one of these\r\nmonths may be the coldest in different years. In some years snow exposed\r\nto the sun thaws very slightly during these months; in other winters\r\nthere is no thaw whatever. The snow attains its greatest depth, about\r\nthree feet, in March. By April 10, the snow begins to thaw decidedly in\r\nthe sunshine. From May 1 to May 6, the earlier waterfowl arrive. The\r\nsmall streams break up about May 10 or 12. Between the middle and the\r\nend of May, most of the small birds arrive. At the end of May or early\r\nin June, the earlier shrubs and herbaceous plants flower and sprout\r\ntheir leaves. Frogs are heard at the same time. By the last week of May\r\nthere is\r\n\r\n                       BRIGHT LIGHT AT MIDNIGHT.\r\n\r\nNo snow, excepting the remains of deep drifts, is left. On June 8\r\n(1826), the small lake was clear of ice, having been frozen for two\r\nhundred and forty days. By the middle of June the summer is fairly\r\nestablished. Great Bear lake begins to break up about June 20, and drift\r\nice sometimes obstructs navigation until the first or second week in\r\nAugust. By July 25 blueberries (_vaccinium uliginosum_) are ripe. At the\r\nbeginning of August or first of September snow falls. Several frosts set\r\nin by the last of September. In October, when the soil begins to freeze,\r\nthe summer thaw has penetrated about twenty-one inches, beneath which\r\nthe ground is perpetually frozen. The small lakes are frozen over by\r\nOctober 10 or 12, and the last of the waterfowl depart. The bays of\r\nGreat Bear lake are filled with new ice by the end of October or early\r\nin November, but the centre of the lake does not freeze over until\r\nDecember. The ice attains a thickness of about eight feet.”\r\n\r\nBear river opens at its head early in May, the result (according to\r\nRichardson) of its being fed by warm water from the depths of the lake.\r\nProbably from the same cause the lake remains open at the outlet until\r\nvery late in the autumn, or throughout the winter. At the rapid of Bear\r\nriver the ice forms from the bottom and sides and finally completely\r\nblocks the stream. The resulting overflow continually adds to the volume\r\nof ice, which reaches an enormous thickness. The heat of an ordinary\r\nsummer is insufficient to melt this mass entirely, and great quantities\r\nof it usually exist on the south or sheltered bank throughout the\r\nseason. This vast accumulation of ice probably prevents the lower part\r\nof the river from opening as soon as the early disruption of its upper\r\npart would seem to justify. Richardson states that the lower part\r\nusually opens in June, while Petitot gives the usual time as the last of\r\nMay. In 1904 it was already open when the Mackenzie broke up at Fort\r\nNorman on May 21.\r\n\r\nGreat Bear lake, according to the Geological Survey, has an area of\r\napproximately eleven thousand four hundred square miles and lies three\r\nhundred and ninety-one feet above the level of the sea. Its shores, with\r\nthe exception of parts of MacTavish bay, are rather low.\r\n\r\nThe area between Great Bear lake and the Arctic coast is said to be\r\nfifty thousand square miles, or about equal to England in size. It is\r\nnearly all to the north of the Arctic circle, and it is doubtful if it\r\nhas any agricultural value, unless Doctor Grenfell’s idea of introducing\r\nreindeer ranching as a commercial enterprise develops.\r\n\r\n                        ANDERSON RIVER COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. MacFarlane’s description of Anderson river region,\r\nnorth of Great Bear lake, the greater part of the ground is every season\r\ncovered with short grasses, mosses, and small flowering plants, while\r\npatches of sedgy or peaty soil occur at longer or shorter distances. On\r\nthese, as well as along the smaller rivulets and river and lake banks,\r\nLabrador tea, crow-berries, and a few other kinds of berries, dwarf\r\nbirch, willows, etc., grow. Large flat spaces had the honeycombed\r\nappearance usually presented in early spring by land which has been\r\nturned over in the autumn. There were few signs of vegetation on these,\r\nwhile some sandy and many other spots were virtually sterile.\r\n\r\nThe area between Great Bear lake, the Mackenzie and the western part of\r\nGreat Slave lake, represents some thirty-five thousand square miles.\r\nWith respect to this region, the indefatigable missionary, Abbé Petitot,\r\nmade numerous journeys through it, of which he subsequently published an\r\naccount. They are, however, merely valuable on geographical and\r\ngeological grounds. References to these reports will be found elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMr. Preble states in his report:—“To the westward of the northern arm,\r\nand north of the main body of Great Slave lake, lies a low, broad\r\nplateau, dotted with many lakes and muskegs. It contains no rivers of\r\nconsequence and is mainly rather thinly wooded, though a number of large\r\nprairies occur in the western part, north of the outlet of Great Slave\r\nlake.”\r\n\r\n                RUSSIAN PROVINCES IN THE SAME LATITUDE.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made in this chapter to an interesting\r\ncomparison made by Wm. Ogilvie, D.L.S., between the Mackenzie country\r\nand Finland and Scandinavia.\r\n\r\nIn his examination before the Senate committee of 1888, Doctor G. M.\r\nDawson instituted a comparison between parts of northwestern Canada and\r\na province of northern European Russia as follows:—“I have a few notes\r\nhere worth considering while we are dealing with the question of this\r\nnorthern country. I looked up the circumstances of the northern\r\nprovinces of Russia and I found that the province of Russia which seemed\r\nto compare most nearly with that shown on this map, both in its relation\r\nin Russia to the Atlantic, corresponding to the relation of this country\r\nto the Pacific, and also in its latitude, is the province of Vologda.\r\nThat province has a total area of one hundred and fifty-five thousand,\r\ntwo hundred and sixty-five square miles, and it is chiefly drained to\r\nthe north like the country shown here. It lies between latitudes 58° and\r\n65°. It is about seven hundred and fifty miles in greatest length and\r\nthree hundred miles greatest width. It is drained by the Dwina river\r\nchiefly. Its products are carried by this river to Archangel and\r\nexported thence in vessels by White sea in the same way that we hope\r\nthis northern country of ours may be served by the Mackenzie and Arctic\r\nsea. The mouth of the Dwina is in latitude 65°, only a little south of\r\nthe latitude of the mouth of the Mackenzie. The climate of the two\r\ncountries is very similar. The winters are severe and the summers warm.\r\nThere is no very heavy rainfall, such as we find near the western coasts\r\nbordering on the Atlantic and on the Pacific. The exports from that\r\nprovince of Vologda are oats, rye, barley, hemp, flax and pulse. The\r\nmineral products are salt, copper, iron and marble. Horses and cattle\r\nare reared, while the skins of various wild animals, as well as pitch\r\nand turpentine, are exported. This province supports a population of one\r\nmillion, one hundred and sixty-one thousand inhabitants.[19]\r\n\r\n“That province is not in Siberia but in Russia proper. Now, we have\r\nareas to the north which may make several provinces like Vologda, and\r\nfor the purpose of illustrating this point I have made a very rough\r\ncalculation here, which as it is founded largely on suppositions, is\r\nperhaps scarcely worthy of being presented to the committee, but may\r\nserve to give an idea. With reference to the agricultural area of Peace\r\nriver, I confine myself to a tract roughly marked on the map as to which\r\nI have some personal knowledge. Without going over what I have already\r\nwritten in reply to that question and which is largely embodied in a\r\nreport published some years ago, I may say that the area which is\r\nincluded in the upper portion of Peace river country, is about\r\nthirty-one thousand five hundred square miles. The proportion which I\r\nestimated as arable land is twenty-three thousand, five hundred square\r\nmiles. That would give ninety-four thousand quarter-sections if it were\r\nsubdivided. Reckoning a family of five persons on each, that area would\r\nbe capable of supporting a population of four hundred and seventy\r\nthousand, or in round figures say five hundred thousand. I do not think\r\nit would be at all beyond the mark (though I am speaking now from the\r\nreport of others, because I have not been farther down Peace river\r\nmyself) to assume that there is another area at least equally great of\r\narable land in Mackenzie valley to the north of this. That will give\r\nanother population of say five hundred thousand. Now, if we take the\r\nheadwaters of the Mackenzie and the Yukon west of the mountains, I think\r\nwe shall be well within the limits of probability if we say that we have\r\nthere thirty thousand square miles of that region which may be\r\ncultivated with advantage. This, on the same basis as before, would\r\nsupport a population of six hundred thousand persons, or a total of say\r\none million, five hundred thousand persons in Mackenzie valley, and\r\nadjacent tracts, to the north altogether of the Saskatchewan watershed,\r\nand on the west of the mountains, north of British Columbia. I think we\r\nmight, without exaggeration, by including miners, fur traders, hunters,\r\nlumbermen and those engaged in transport or trade, besides those in\r\noutlying fertile sections not included in this—double the total just\r\narrived at. This will give us a population of three million people in\r\nthat part of the Dominion alone. As I am not personally familiar with\r\nlower Mackenzie region east of the mountains, I may have underestimated\r\nits value.\r\n\r\n                          A SIBERIAN PROVINCE.\r\n\r\nAlong the same lines the late Robert E. Young, D.L.S., at that time\r\nSuperintendent of Railway Lands and Chief Geographer, giving evidence\r\nbefore the select standing committee of the Canadian House of Commons on\r\nAgriculture and Colonization, March 11, 1908, instituted in a graphic\r\nmanner a comparison between Mackenzie basin and the Siberian province of\r\nTobolsk.\r\n\r\nMr. Young had prepared a map of the province of Tobolsk drawn to the\r\nsame scale as a map of Canada hanging in the room, and attached the\r\nsmall map to the larger, overlying part of the valley of the Mackenzie,\r\ntaking care that the lines of latitude corresponded exactly.\r\n\r\nThis demonstrated that rather more than half the province of Tobolsk is\r\nnorth of the 60th parallel, which is the southern limit of the country\r\nimmediately under discussion, although the southern portion of the\r\nRussian province extends in a narrow point as far south as 52° 15′′, its\r\ngeneral southern boundary is, in latitude, about ten miles north of\r\nAthabaska or one hundred miles north of Winnipeg.\r\n\r\nMr. Young proceeded to point out on the map of Tobolsk, the location of\r\nthe chief cities of the Russian province:—Tobolsk, with a population of\r\ntwenty thousand, four hundred and twenty-seven, situated at exactly the\r\nlatitude of Fort Vermilion on Peace river; and Omsk, on the line of the\r\ngreat Siberian Railway, with a population of thirty-seven thousand, four\r\nhundred and seventy, situated at a spot corresponding with a point ten\r\nmiles north of Athabaska, and about a hundred miles north of Edmonton.\r\nMr. Young also pointed out the situation of the city of Tomsk, with\r\nfifty-two thousand and five population, a province adjoining Tobolsk,\r\nsituated at about the same latitude as Chipewyan on Lake Athabaska, or a\r\ntrifle farther north. Mr. Young went on to explain that in 1900 the\r\npopulation of the province of Tobolsk was one million five hundred\r\nthousand.[20]\r\n\r\n               A LARGE TOWN NORTH OF WRIGLEY’S LATITUDE.\r\n\r\nAsked how far north the line of habitation extended, Mr. Young\r\nreplied:—“I might say that two-thirds of the way up we find a road\r\nmarked on the map which would indicate settlement, I suppose. I also\r\nhave figures here of the population of some eight or ten towns in the\r\nprovince of Tobolsk. There is one of one thousand, another of three\r\nthousand, another of seven thousand, one of eight thousand, and so on.\r\nThe farthest north is the town of Bere-zoff, with a population of one\r\nthousand two hundred and in latitude 63·50°” (some ten miles north of\r\nFort Wrigley).\r\n\r\nMr. Young, being asked as to the number of convicts who had been sent\r\ninto Tobolsk, replied:—“I do not know as to that. Whether they were\r\nconvicts or not, in 1900 they raised six million, four hundred and\r\neighty thousand bushels of wheat, three million odd bushels of rye, nine\r\nhundred and seventy-two thousand bushels of barley, and ten million, six\r\nhundred and seventeen thousand bushels of oats. These figures are\r\ncontained in the Encyclopedia Britannica.” (In 1906 the figures\r\nwere:—Wheat, eleven million, seven hundred and seventy-nine thousand\r\nbushels; rye, four million, three hundred and forty-four thousand\r\nbushels; barley, eight hundred and twenty-nine thousand bushels; oats,\r\nthirteen million, eight hundred and eighteen thousand bushels).[21]\r\n\r\nAsked if it was not the southern portion of the province in which most\r\nof these crops were raised, Mr. Young replied:—“It certainly would be.\r\nI think there is no question that it would be in the most southerly\r\nportion. All the information I have would go to show that settlement\r\nwould not extend to the most northerly regions. Still the fact that\r\nthere were towns of one thousand people in the northern portion would go\r\nto show that there must be something being done there that would support\r\na town of that size. I have tried to work out some parallel between the\r\nclimatic conditions there and our own country, but I am not able to give\r\nit to you exactly. I think that the figures given by the Russian\r\ngovernment would probably be the most favourable that they could\r\nfurnish. The mean temperature for the period from September 1 to June 1,\r\nwhich would include the winter months—I think that is all it is\r\nnecessary to discuss—would for the province of Tobolsk be practically\r\nthe\r\n\r\n                  SAME TEMPERATURE AS AT FORT SIMPSON.\r\n\r\nIt is a very striking thing that a million and a half of people live in\r\nthat province, and that they raised six million, four hundred and eighty\r\nthousand bushels of wheat in 1900. Surely if our country is as good as\r\nwe think it is, we ought to people it to as great and even a greater\r\nextent, and to complete the parallel between the two, I think I can say\r\nwithout any hesitation that we have something which they have not got,\r\nand that is the benefit of British institutions.”\r\n\r\nMr. Young, later on in his evidence, remarked that there are a great\r\nmany other statistics about Siberia that are interesting. For instance,\r\nfrom a province adjoining Tobolsk they exported forty thousand pounds of\r\nhoney in 1900.\r\n\r\n                    SAMPLES OF NORTHERN GROWN WHEAT.\r\n\r\nMr. Young, during his examination upon the occasion here referred to,\r\ngave a great deal of information regarding agricultural development and\r\npossibilities in the Mackenzie country. He showed the committee a sample\r\nof Ladoga wheat grown at Fort Simpson, and in producing it said:—“I got\r\nit from Doctor Saunders, Director of Experimental Farms. Fort Simpson is\r\nthe farthest north of these red points[22] just short of latitude 62° or\r\njust about it. I showed that wheat to a gentleman who is accounted an\r\nauthority on the subject, and I think you could not get a better\r\nauthority; I am referring to Senator Finlay Young. I said, ‘Mr. Young,\r\nwould you please look at that wheat, but do not refer to the label on\r\nthe bottle, and tell me what you think of it?’ Mr. Young examined the\r\nsample in the way that men who are experts on wheat often do. I think he\r\nsaw nearly every grain of it; he took good care to do so. He said, ‘It\r\nis very nice wheat, I would call it good wheat. It has been slightly\r\nfrosted, but I think that wheat would go about sixty-four pounds to the\r\nbushel.’ Well, the label on the sample says ‘Ladoga wheat, grown at Fort\r\nSimpson on Mackenzie river, sixty-two pounds to the bushel.’”\r\n\r\nProducing another sample of grain, Mr. Young remarked:—“Now gentlemen,\r\nhere is a sample of wheat from Fort Vermilion.” I showed that also to\r\nSenator Young and got his opinion on it. In both instances he expressed\r\nhis opinion before he knew where either of the samples came from. He\r\nsaid, “That is pretty nice wheat. It is not so nice a wheat as the\r\nother, but I think it would make first rate flour; it is good wheat.”\r\n\r\n                        BETTER RESULTS EXPECTED.\r\n\r\nMr. Young, in his evidence, drew attention to the fact that the posts in\r\nthe far north at which grain had been grown had not been selected for\r\nwheat raising, but because they were convenient locations for the fur\r\ntrade. He proceeded:—“I want to discuss that point a little further. I\r\nsay there are three reasons why we can expect better results in wheat\r\nraising in our northern country than has been accomplished up to the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\n“(1) I will quote what Professor Macoun has stated in a pamphlet\r\nrelating to the Yukon:—‘When grain ripens in the country and is again\r\nsown there, it will take on the conditions of its environment and mature\r\nearlier, and early frosts like those attributed to Manitoba will have no\r\neffect, as the crop will mature before they come. I may remark here that\r\nthe wheat in the northwest ripens earlier now than it did twenty years\r\nago, and many people believe that it is the climate that has changed,\r\nwhereas it is only that the wheat has adapted itself to its\r\nenvironment.’ I think that any gentleman who has been following the\r\ntrend of affairs in the northwest will agree with me that the conditions\r\nare better with respect to possible injury by summer frosts than they\r\nwere twenty years ago. I think that cannot be questioned. That is one\r\nreason that is given.\r\n\r\n“(2) Now, a few days ago, I asked a gentleman who is better able to\r\nexpress an opinion on the point than I am, what he thought of that\r\nstatement of Professor Macoun’s. He said:—‘I don’t altogether agree\r\nwith that statement. I do not hesitate at all in saying that the\r\nimprovement is marked, but I will account for it in another way. If you\r\nraise wheat on virgin soil on the prairie it will grow to perhaps about\r\nthe height of a man’s shoulder the first year. The next year it will not\r\nbe quite so high. The third year it will be perhaps not so high as the\r\nsecond year, but it will mature earlier. Devote that land to some other\r\nuse for a year or two and then go back to the cultivation of wheat\r\nagain, and you will get the wheat growing to the height of about the\r\nsecond or third year, but it will mature earlier. The soil is\r\nsharpened.’ He explained to me that in Red river valley, where the land\r\nis heavier, it would take very many years to bring about that result,\r\nand it would not be of so much value to this generation, but in the\r\nlighter soil, farther west, it has a marked effect, and, as he argued,\r\nthere is no question about it.\r\n\r\n“(3) The third reason why we can expect better results in that north\r\ncountry is because the staff at the Experimental Farm have been steadily\r\ncarrying on experiments with a view to obtaining a variety of wheat that\r\nwill ripen a few days earlier, and if they can shorten the term for the\r\nripening of wheat by four or five days or a week, it will bring into the\r\ncertain line, as to wheat growing, an enormous area of land. There is no\r\nquestion about it. They have accomplished some good things already, and\r\nthey expect to accomplish a great deal more.”\r\n\r\nMr. Young stated before the committee on this occasion that “there is no\r\nquestion about it that in the north country there are grasses of the\r\ngreatest possible value to cattle raising, finer grasses than there are\r\nin other parts of the northwest.”\r\n\r\n                PROFESSOR MACOUN’S ESTIMATE STILL HOLDS.\r\n\r\nSpeaking in his evidence generally about the suitability of the far\r\nnorthwestern country for agricultural pursuits, and specially discussing\r\nthe climatic condition, Mr. Young remarked:—“About three weeks ago I\r\nwrote to Professor Macoun and gave him a list of questions about that\r\ncountry to which I asked him to give me answers. I think it is a very\r\nremarkable thing that in his reply he says: ‘In my report to Mr.\r\nAlexander Mackenzie in 1877, just when I was fresh in the northwest, I\r\ngave details about certain districts of the northland which I could not\r\ngive in a letter, but I would suggest that extracts from this report may\r\nbe taken and placed upon file with this letter, as my statements and\r\nconclusions as printed thirty years ago still remain without impeachment\r\nat the present time.’ I think it is a remarkable thing that with respect\r\nto the country through which Professor Macoun went in 1872 and 1873, and\r\nwhich excited his enthusiasm—this is the country that I am trying to\r\ntell you about—he now says of it: ‘My statements remain without\r\nimpeachment at the present time.’ Now, he speaks in this letter of two\r\nfacts that I think are very striking. He says, ‘In conclusion, I may say\r\nthat the climate of the whole northland is a stable one, and as local\r\nconditions change it will improve, and where small spots are now called\r\ngood land, whole areas will take that term. The low altitude and the\r\nlong day are fixed conditions and will always be the same. The forest\r\nwill be cleared and the muskegs drained, and as the land becomes drier\r\nthe frosty conditions will pass away and a good country will result.’”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[18] Franklin (“Narrative of a Journey, etc.”) relates that the\r\nthermometer during the month of October, 1820, at Fort Enterprise\r\n(headwaters of the Coppermine) never rose above 37° but never fell below\r\n5°. The mean temperature for the month was 23°. The highest temperature\r\nat the same place in the following April was 40° above zero, the lowest\r\n32° below. The mean was 4° above zero. May 9, the snow had disappeared\r\nfrom the ground. The first robin appeared May 14. The average\r\ntemperature for May was nearly 32° above zero; the greatest heat 68° and\r\nthe lowest 8°. At the end of the month there was constant daylight.\r\n\r\nWhen the Franklin expedition was at Fort Franklin (west side of Great\r\nBear lake) in 1826, the first flower was gathered on May 27. (“Narrative\r\nof a Second Expedition, etc.”)\r\n\r\n[19] The population of Vologda, in 1910, the latest available, was one\r\nmillion, five hundred and ninety-seven thousand, five hundred, or ten\r\nper square mile. (E. J. C.)\r\n\r\n[20] The figures for 1906 were:—city of Tobolsk, twenty thousand, eight\r\nhundred; Omsk, forty-three thousand, four hundred; province of Tobolsk,\r\none million, six hundred and fifty-six thousand, seven hundred. In 1910,\r\nthe total population of the province of Tobolsk was given as one\r\nmillion, seven hundred and sixty-nine thousand, eight hundred. According\r\nto latest statistics available the population of the four million, eight\r\nhundred and seventeen thousand, six hundred and eighty-seven square\r\nmiles comprising Siberia is eight million, two hundred and twenty\r\nthousand, one hundred. Siberia in 1910 raised one hundred and seventy\r\nmillion poods of cereals. A pood equals thirty-six pounds. E. J. C.\r\n\r\n[21] According to a blue book issued by the Board of Trade of Great\r\nBritain in 1905, the province of Tobolsk in 1901 contained three\r\nmillion, eight hundred and four thousand, eight hundred and forty-seven\r\nhead of life stock, and from one district alone, viz: Kurgan (about the\r\nlatitude of Peace river) there was exported in 1902, nineteen million,\r\nseven hundred and eleven thousand, four hundred and forty-six pounds of\r\nbutter, which was largely marketed in Great Britain. E. J.

It is true that there are large muskeg and rocky areas in the\r\nbasin of the Mackenzie which support no tree growth, but the aggregate\r\nforest wealth of the country is immense.\r\n\r\nMr. Elihu Stewart, formerly Superintendent of Forestry, testified before\r\nthe Senate committee of 1907 that the principal tree between Rocky\r\nmountains and the plains is the spruce, mostly the white spruce, and\r\nfrom its position near the prairie there is no doubt that it will be\r\nmore sought after to meet the increasing demands from that quarter. The\r\ncountry along the upper waters north of Saskatchewan, Athabaska and\r\nPeace rivers, is partly prairie and partly wood. The varieties of timber\r\nare principally aspen and balsam poplar, the former predominating, and\r\nwhite spruce. The poplars, as we go north, seem to increase in size and\r\nheight. Below the junction of the Smoky they grow very clean and\r\nstraight, not over a foot or fourteen inches in diameter, but reaching a\r\nheight of seventeen or eighteen feet, making excellent building timber,\r\nas well as fencing and fuel. In some parts there are stretches of good\r\nspruce well adapted for lumbering purposes. There has so far been but\r\nlittle destruction from fire in this quarter. The land is mostly level,\r\nsoil excellent, and if the summer frosts do not prevent it, the country\r\nwill begin soon to settle up and there will be an ample supply of timber\r\nfor local uses, if not for export to the adjoining prairie regions. Mr.\r\nStewart said he never saw as fine poplar as he saw there. A considerable\r\nnumber of poplars were over a foot, but a foot would be a fair average.\r\nHe had seen poplar in all parts of the prairie country, but never saw\r\nanything growing up as straight.\r\n\r\n                    LIMIT OF TREE GROWTH FAR NORTH.\r\n\r\nMr. Stewart explained that spruce suitable for commercial purposes grows\r\nto Arctic sea. He was astonished to find that the limit of tree growth\r\nextended as far north as it does. He thought it extended probably ten\r\ndegrees farther north in this district than in Labrador. The different\r\nkinds of trees that grow in Mackenzie basin include white spruce, black\r\nspruce, the larch or tamarack, which is found as far north as the\r\nspruce, the jackpine and the balsam. Mr. Stewart did not see any balsam\r\nin the Arctic circle; aspen, white poplar, balm of Gilead and birch are\r\nall found down as far as Fort McPherson. The natives make their canoes\r\nout of birch bark at Fort McPherson. The size of the timber becomes less\r\ntowards the north. There is timber probably fourteen inches in diameter\r\ngrowing near the junctions of Peace and Slave rivers. Below Fort Good\r\nHope the timber is smaller. Some of it has been made into flooring, and\r\nlumber is made from the timber there. There is a large supply of spruce\r\nsuitable for pulp as far north as that.\r\n\r\nMr. Stewart, replying to a question, said he thought it possible to use\r\nthis poplar wood for commercial purposes. It is very good poplar. It\r\nwill make pulp, and where it is large enough it can be sawed. It makes\r\nexcellent flooring. The white poplar in the north is of a better quality\r\nthan the poplar in Ottawa district. In Saskatchewan district and in the\r\nfar west it is different. In a colder climate it grows more slowly.\r\n\r\nAs to the extent of the forests, Mr. Stewart remarked that wherever\r\nthere was a stream there would be a belt of timber.\r\n\r\nAlong Athabaska river there is a very big waterpower. There are Grand\r\nrapids and various other points eighty miles north. On Slave river there\r\nare about sixteen miles of rapids, which constitute the interruption to\r\nnavigation, and it would make excellent waterpower. There is no\r\nwaterpower on the Mackenzie below Fort Smith, on the main stream. From\r\nSmith Landing to Fort Smith the timber is jackpine, some of which is\r\nquite large enough for railway ties. The timber on the heavier soil\r\nconsists of black and white poplar, spruce, birch and willow of small\r\nsize and of little value.\r\n\r\n                       TIMBER ALONG SLAVE RIVER.\r\n\r\nMr. McConnell states (Geol. Survey Report, 1887-8) that on both sides of\r\nSlave river below Salt river are level plains, which extend without any\r\nevident elevation as far as the eye can reach, and support extensive\r\nforests of white spruce and Banksian pine mingled with larch and rough\r\nand smooth barked poplar. The spruce frequently attains a diameter of\r\neighteen inches and makes excellent timber. In the vicinity of Slave\r\nriver rapids the country is mostly level, and is covered with white\r\nspruce, Banksian pine, the rough and smooth barked poplars and various\r\nspecies of willow and alder. The Mackenzie river steamer “Wrigley” was\r\nbuilt here in the winter of 1887, and the timber used in construction\r\nwas all obtained from the surrounding forest.\r\n\r\nMr. Wm. Ogilvie says in his report:—\r\n\r\n“The level country surrounding the lower half of Great Slave river is\r\nall well timbered with fine large spruce, equalling in this lower\r\nAthabaska and Peace rivers, and I think, when the time comes, that here\r\nwill be found this district’s principal supply lumber. On the high,\r\nlight soil round Fort Smith, the trees are small and generally of no\r\nvalue except for fuel. Along the river, between the rapids and Lake\r\nAthabaska, there are many small areas of flat, swampy ground which would\r\nsupply some very fair timber.\r\n\r\n“The varieties of trees along the lower part of the river are few,\r\nspruce, with a few small tamarack, some small birch, and a few poplar\r\nconstituting the bulk of the forest. The spruce far outnumber all the\r\nrest. On some of the islands there is much shrubbery, willows, and\r\nalders growing in profusion in the swampy places; but, in general, the\r\nundergrowth is stunted and thin, especially on the uplands.”\r\n\r\nMr. E. A. Preble of the United States Biological Survey, describing\r\nSlave river in his report writes:—“Here the willows and poplars which\r\nborder the stream alternate with stretches of fine white spruce (_Picea\r\ncanadensis_), some of which attain a diameter of three feet and rear\r\ntheir summits to a height of one hundred and fifty feet.”\r\n\r\nThe aspen poplar (_Populus tremuloides_), according to Mr. Preble,\r\noccurs nearly throughout the wooded region. In favourable places along\r\nthe Athabaska and Slave it attains a large size, and this is the case\r\nalso about Fort Simpson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Slave river near Fort Smith.]\r\n\r\n                           THE WHITE SPRUCE.\r\n\r\nMr. E. A. Preble states that the white spruce (_Picea canadensis_)\r\nreaches its perfection in the alluvial bottoms of Slave river\r\nvalley:—“In favourable places along Slave river it attains a diameter\r\nof three feet, and a height of nearly one hundred and fifty. This\r\nspecies, usually called ‘pine’ in the north, is the commonest timber\r\ntree of the region, and occurs north to the limit of the forest. Along\r\ncertain rivers which enter the Barren Grounds from the southward, the\r\nrange of this species is extended far beyond its general limits, and\r\nsometimes the isolated colonies are of large extent. Most of the lumber\r\nused in building and general constructive work throughout the region is\r\nfurnished by this species. Its wood is soft and easily worked, and\r\nthough admirably adapted for some purposes, is used for others only from\r\nnecessity. Its slender fibrous roots, split into long strips are used by\r\nthe natives to sew together the pieces of birch bark in the constrution\r\nof canoes and various utensils. Its bark, stripped from the trunks in\r\nearly spring, forms the usual roofing material, taking the place of\r\nshingles throughout the region, except at a few favoured posts.”\r\n\r\nMr. Preble states that the Banksian pine (pinus divaricata) is the only\r\nspecies of pine north of the Athabaska. He reports that along Slave\r\nriver it appears only occasionally, usually where high gravelly banks\r\napproach the river. It is common, however, on the rocky hills about\r\nChipewyan and Smith Landing, and is the predominating tree on the\r\nrolling sandy plains on Smith portage and about Fort Smith.\r\n\r\n                        A COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY.\r\n\r\nA very comprehensive summary of the evidence available as to the timber\r\nresources of the Mackenzie was prepared by R. E. Young, D.L.S., and\r\nsubmitted by him to the House of Commons committee on Agriculture and\r\nColonization in 1908. In this document, Mr. Young had his information\r\nclassified according to valleys, a very convenient arrangement\r\nconsidering that the best of the timber growth is in the valleys, and\r\nthat the rivers are the only routes of exploration as yet generally\r\navailable. Some additional data have since been obtained which will be\r\nincorporated with Mr. Young’s statement, or substituted for portions of\r\nit, this being according to a suggestion made by Mr. Young himself\r\nshortly before his most regrettable death. The succeeding pages of this\r\nchapter consist largely of Mr. Young’s own statement (see report of\r\ncommittee, pages 159 to 188).\r\n\r\nOf the excellence of the forests from Salt river down there can be no\r\ndoubt. As long ago as 1772 Samuel Hearne, the first white man to reach\r\nGreat Slave lake on his return journey from the mouth of the Coppermine,\r\nentered the mouth of Slave river and went up it some distance before\r\nstarting inland on his journey back to Hudson bay. It is very\r\ninteresting to note what Hearne at that distant date said: “The woods\r\naround this river, particularly the pines and poplars, are the tallest\r\nand stoutest that I have seen in any part of North America. The birch\r\nalso grows to a considerable size and some species of the willow are\r\nlikewise tall, but none of them have any trunk like those in England.”\r\nOn the island of the lake near the mouth of the river, Hearne saw great\r\nquantities of driftwood. He says: “some of this wood is large enough to\r\nmake masts for the largest ships that are built. The woods through which\r\nwe were to pass were in many places so thick that it was necessary to\r\ncut a path before the women could pass with their sledges, and in other\r\nplaces so much of the woods had formerly been set on fire and burnt that\r\nwe were frequently obliged to walk farther than we otherwise should have\r\ndone, before we could find green brush enough to floor our tents.”\r\n\r\nBishop Clut, O.M.I., before the Senate committee of 1888, stated that\r\nfrom Fort Smith to Fort Resolution there is a great quantity of\r\nbeautiful forest, white spruce or ordinary larch. Spruce from two to\r\nthree feet in diameter is found. The birch of the country is very hard\r\nand would make good furniture. It is from birch that they make traineau,\r\nbuggies, chairs and snowshoes. In the country lying to the south and\r\nwest of Great Slave lake there is a good deal of forest of beautiful\r\ncoppice wood, ordinary spruce, and black or red spruce.\r\n\r\n                   THE TIMBER ABOUT GREAT SLAVE LAKE.\r\n\r\nHay river flows into the southwest part of Great Slave lake. Of the\r\ncountry around, Mr. McConnell says: “Grassy and partly wooded plains\r\nextend northwards from Peace river and skirt its southern shores. It is\r\nthe northern limit of the prairie region. Near its mouth the country on\r\nboth sides is thickly forested with Banksian pine and white spruce to\r\nAlexandra falls.”\r\n\r\nThe country from here east to Slave river is known to be well wooded,\r\nbut strange as it may seem, the country from Slave river east has never\r\nbeen explored since Samuel Hearne passed through it in 1772, one hundred\r\nand thirty-six years ago. Somewhere southeast of the lake, Hearne spoke\r\nof a long narrow lake “entirely surrounded with high land which produces\r\na vast quantity of fir trees, but none of them grow to a great height in\r\nthose parts. Their branches, however, spread wider than those of firs\r\nthree times their height and thickness do in Europe, so that they\r\nresemble an apple tree in shape. They seem rich in tar as the wood of\r\nthem will burn like a candle and emit as strong a smell and as much\r\nblack smoke as the staves of an old tar barrel. The under woods were so\r\nthick in these parts as to render travelling through them very\r\ndifficult.” Of the part of Great Slave lake where Hearne crossed it, he\r\nsays: “The point where we crossed it is said to be the narrowest. It is\r\nfull of islands most of which are clothed with fine, tall poplars, birch\r\nand pines, etc.”\r\n\r\nMr. E. A. Preble, in his report, has this to say of Great Slave\r\nlake:—“Great Slave lake lies wholly within the forested region, though\r\nsome of its eastern affluents drain large areas of treeless country. Its\r\nsouthwestern shores, being watered by rivers coming from the south and\r\nsouthwest, are well wooded, while the northern shores, exposed for most\r\nof the year to cold winds from the north and watered by colder streams,\r\nare poorly wooded. The soil conditions, also, being more favourable on\r\nthe southern side of the lake, exert a marked influence on the\r\nforesting. The eastern arm of the lake, however, is largely removed from\r\nthese modifying influences, and the conditions on its northern and\r\nsouthern borders are more nearly uniform.”\r\n\r\n                       FORESTS NORTH OF THE LAKE.\r\n\r\nThe country to the north of Great Slave lake has been much more\r\nthoroughly examined.\r\n\r\nR. G. McConnell (Geol. Rep., 1887-88) wintered at Fort Providence on the\r\nMackenzie and made a winter journey northeast to Fort Rae, on the long\r\narm of the lake that reaches out to the north. From Fort Providence to\r\nBirch lake, half the distance across, he crossed the Grand Brulé, the\r\nscene of a former destructive fire, wherein he says there were three\r\nwide prairies with the intervening timber belts. From here on he crossed\r\nfirst a well wooded country where some excellent spruce was seen, then a\r\nmore scantily clad country with groves of spruce, poplar, birch and\r\nalder, and thence to Fort Rae a thick spruce forest.\r\n\r\nJ. M. Bell (Geol. Rep., 1904) describes the country along Martin river\r\nand chain of lakes emptying into the long northern arm of the lake as\r\nthickly wooded with aspen, balsam poplar, canoe-birch, white spruce and\r\nBanksian pine.\r\n\r\nMr. Preble made the trip from the north of Great Slave lake to Great\r\nBear lake via the lake, and portage route. August 25, a few days after\r\npassing the height of land, he reports:—“The portage track led over\r\nrocky ground on the left bank. Favourable spots at the rapid supported a\r\ngood growth of spruce, with a luxuriant undergrowth of _Viburnum\r\npauciflorum_, _Rosa acicularis_, _Rubus strigosus_, and _Vaccinium\r\nuliginosum_. Since leaving Lake Hardisty I had observed an increased\r\nluxuriance in the forest growth, evidently the result of a more\r\nfavourable soil and the slightly decreased altitude.”\r\n\r\nMr. Preble states that the Banksian pine “occurs commonly about the\r\nnorthern arm of Great Slave lake. On my route to the northward of Fort\r\nRae it was seen in many places on Grandin river, reaching a diameter of\r\neighteen inches, but not growing very tall. North of the height of land\r\nit was rare, but I saw many trees on a portage a few miles north of the\r\noutlet of Lake Hardisty.”\r\n\r\nMr. Preble states that on the canoe route between the north arm of Great\r\nSlave lake and Great Bear lake the white spruce is common, varying in\r\nluxuriance according to the local conditions.\r\n\r\n                            THE CANOE BIRCH.\r\n\r\nThe canoe birch (_betula papyrifera_), according to Mr. Preble, is a\r\ncommon tree throughout the wooded region. It reaches its perfection in\r\nthe southern part of the country and northward gradually decreases in\r\nsize. On the canoe route north of Fort Rae, it was found to be common,\r\nreaching a diameter of nearly one foot as far north as Lake St. Croix. A\r\ntree five inches in diameter, examined near that lake, had sixty-five\r\nannual rings. Another specimen one and three-quarter inches in diameter,\r\non the shores of Lake Hardisty, had been growing twenty-five years, and\r\none three-fourths of an inch thick was fifteen years old. This tree is\r\nof great economic importance to the natives of the region. Its wood,\r\nthough soft when green, is rather hard when seasoned, and takes a high\r\npolish. The frames of snowshoes, the runners of sleds and toboggans, and\r\nthe handles of axes and other tools are usually made of it. In addition\r\nto furnishing the covering for canoes, its bark is used in the\r\nconstruction of baskets, and various household utensils, and to some\r\nextent for constructing shelters.\r\n\r\nThe natives gather up the sap in spring and boil it down into syrup. An\r\nincision is made with the axe on the side of the tree, and the sap\r\ngathers and drops from a projecting point of bark. At Fort Simpson in\r\n1904, the sap was running freely from April 20 to May 1.\r\n\r\nYellowknife river flows into the eastern side of the north arm of Great\r\nSlave lake coming from a northern direction. Sir John Franklin, who\r\nascended and descended this river in his journeys of 1819-22, says that\r\nthis river flows between high rocky banks on which there is sufficient\r\nsoil to support pines, birch and poplars, but in the upper stretches the\r\ncountry has a very barren aspect. From here to Fort Enterprise the\r\ncountry is much the same. Mr. Back (afterwards Sir George Back), one of\r\nhis party on his winter journey back from Fort Enterprise, wrote that\r\nafter passing Reindeer lake “the scenery consisted of barren rocks and\r\nhigh hills, covered with lofty pine, birch and larch trees. There was a\r\nvisible increase of wood, consisting of birch and larch, as we inclined\r\nto the southward.”\r\n\r\n                          FORT ENTERPRISE.[23]\r\n\r\nIn his journal of August 19, 1820, Sir John Franklin, speaking of his\r\nwinter quarters known as Fort Enterprise, says: “The trees were numerous\r\nand of a far greater size than we had supposed them to be yesterday,\r\nsome of the pines being thirty or forty feet high and two feet in\r\ndiameter at the root.” Near by was the Winter river, whose banks, he\r\nsays, were well clothed with pines. On the same day they unfortunately\r\nset fire to the woods. “A fire was made on the south side of the river\r\nto inform the chief of our arrival, which, spreading before a strong\r\nwind, caught the whole wood, and we were completely enveloped in a cloud\r\nof smoke for the three following days.” Their winter quarters were made\r\nfrom wood cut in the vicinity, though of the size of the logs no mention\r\nis made. From here to Coppermine river the only trees were scattered\r\ndwarf pines.\r\n\r\nMr. Wm. Ogilvie states that on the flats between Great Slave lake and\r\nFort Simpson, as well as those adjoining the lake, “there is much forest\r\nthat would yield a large amount of good sized spruce and poplar.”\r\n\r\nMr. Elihu Stewart says that the land at the entrance to Mackenzie river\r\nis low and covered with spruce and tamarack of small size. Islands\r\ncovered with green timber are numerous and the appearance is suggestive\r\nof the lower St. Lawrence. The timber along the Mackenzie to Fort\r\nSimpson is smaller than that found along Slave river, but nevertheless\r\nit is of sufficient size in some cases for lumber.\r\n\r\nSir John Franklin (Journey, 1819-22) says that around Fort Providence\r\nthe surface of the hills is generally naked, but in the valleys between\r\nthem a few spruce, aspen and birch grow.\r\n\r\nSir Alexander MacKenzie (1789) also speaks of the country north of the\r\nMackenzie after leaving Slave lake as follows: “He (an Indian) at the\r\nsame time informed us that a river falls in from the north, which takes\r\nits rise in Horn mountain, now in sight, which is the country of the\r\nBeaver Indians, and that he and his relatives frequently meet on that\r\nriver. He also added that there were very extensive plains on both sides\r\nof it, which abound in buffaloes and moose deer.”\r\n\r\nMr. R. G. McConnell (Geol. Survey Rep. 1887-88) says that from Fort\r\nProvidence southwest along Beaver river to Lake Bis-tcho is a desolate\r\nlooking plain scantily covered with spruce and tamarack. Lake Bis-tcho\r\nis surrounded by a flat country, wooded with spruce, birch and tamarack\r\nof fair size.\r\n\r\n                          ABOUT FORT SIMPSON.\r\n\r\nJames Anderson of Winnipeg left Fort Simpson in 1852 when eleven years\r\nold (Senate Report 1888). He says: “Round Fort Simpson itself, I\r\nremember the timber was very large. It was fir, poplar and birch.” He\r\ncalls the fir hemlock but no doubt means the spruce. Poplar and birch he\r\nsays were the other varieties. He says that the fir was a very large\r\nkind. The men used to square the timber to about one foot square, for\r\nbuilding their houses, and the fort itself was built of squared timber.\r\nHe says the way he remembers the birch was that it was used so much in\r\nthe making of snowshoes and other things.\r\n\r\nMr. Stewart (1906) says there is a small-sized sawmill at Fort Simpson,\r\nnot now running, in which lumber twelve inches in width was cut and used\r\nin buildings at this post. “One cannot but be struck,” he says, “with\r\nthe vast quantity of spruce along the route traversed (from Fort\r\nProvidence to Fort Simpson), which is a little under size for lumber but\r\nwould make excellent pulpwood.”\r\n\r\nMr. R. G. McConnell, in his evidence before the Senate committee of\r\n1907, stated that the timber about Fort Simpson is confined to large\r\nspruce. White spruce is the main tree all through that country. Spruce\r\nfrom a few inches up to two feet through occurs all the way along the\r\nMackenzie, on the flats, and on nearly all the tributary streams.\r\n\r\nReporting upon the Banksian pine Mr. Preble states:—“On the Mackenzie\r\nit is common north to about latitude 64 degrees. About Fort Simpson, in\r\nsuitable localities, it forms groves of well-grown trees reaching a\r\ndiameter of eighteen inches. A tree eleven inches in diameter near the\r\nbase, examined at Fort Simpson, had one hundred and two annual rings. On\r\nthe north slope of the Nahanni mountains, seventy-five miles below Fort\r\nSimpson, the species ascends to about one thousand feet and then becomes\r\na dwarfed shrub and disappears. On the southern slopes of the same\r\nmountains it occurs as a fairly well-grown tree about two thousand feet\r\nnear the summit.”\r\n\r\nAs to the balsam poplar (_Populus balsamifera_) Mr. Preble\r\nreports:—“The balsam poplar inhabits the entire length of Athabaska,\r\nSlave, and Mackenzie rivers, reaching its greatest perfection of habit\r\non Athabaska, Slave, Peace, and Liard rivers. On the Mackenzie, at Fort\r\nSimpson, it is a stately tree, but below that point it rapidly decreases\r\nin size, and on the lower Mackenzie and Peel rivers occurs only as a\r\nsmall tree. Its wood is put to very little use except for fuel, and even\r\nfor this purpose it is not well adapted.”\r\n\r\n                       THE TAMARACK AND ITS USES.\r\n\r\nMr. Preble reports the Koch tamarack (_Larix Laricina_) “is common at\r\nFort Simpson and reaches a good size. On June 1, 1904, the leaves were\r\njust beginning to appear, tinging the swamps with their beautiful shade\r\nof green. As I descended the river the progress of vegetation kept pace\r\nin a general way with my rate of travel. At Fort Norman, on June 11, the\r\nleaves and cones of the tamaracks were just appearing and at Fort Good\r\nHope, ten days later, they were about half grown.\r\n\r\n“The tamarack is found throughout the region north to the limit of the\r\nforest, occurring mainly in muskegs where it is sometimes the\r\npredominating tree. Since its wood is tougher than any other native to\r\nthe region, it is used to a considerable extent to form the keels and\r\ngunwales of boats, and for other purposes where extra strength is\r\nrequired.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the evidence of Mr. R. G. McConnell before the Senate\r\ncommittee of 1907:—“Along the Liard there are good bunches of timber,\r\nand it is the same with all these tributary streams. Once away from the\r\nflats the timber is sparse and the trees are small. Small black spruce\r\ngrow on the muskegs. The timber is simply on the flats and extends back\r\ntwo or three miles from the river. That is not solidly timbered on\r\neither side of the river. The poplar does not grow to a large tree as it\r\ndoes down here. It runs about three to six inches through. The rough\r\nbark poplar grows up to a foot or more.”\r\n\r\n                     MAGNIFICENT FORESTS OF SPRUCE.\r\n\r\nBishop Clut, before the Senate committee of 1888, stated that on Liard\r\nriver, the south branch of which he had ascended often, and on Peace\r\nriver also, there were magnificent forests of spruce. The trees were\r\nfrom eighty to one hundred feet high on the islands.\r\n\r\nThe branch of the Liard which extends south is called the Nelson.\r\nWilliam Ogilvie explored this whole region across to the Peace, coming\r\nout at Fort St. John. Across the height of land the timber is very poor.\r\nOn the Nelson above the forks where the Sikanni Chief branch flows in,\r\nit is heavily timbered. Mr. Ogilvie passed many extensive flats covered\r\nwith beautiful spruce trees. The valley is quite wide and clothed with\r\nfine timber for a distance above the forks of about thirty miles.\r\nFarther down, above Fort Nelson, there are many extensive areas of open\r\nwoods which almost might be classed as prairie, no doubt the result of\r\nforest fires.\r\n\r\nOf Fort Nelson, Mr. Ogilvie says it is surrounded by dense, high forest,\r\nand as the clearing around it is only a few acres in extent, much of the\r\nsun’s warmth is lost during the day. The surface is all heavily wooded\r\nand there are many very large trees, both spruce and balsam poplar. He\r\nselected the average sized balsam poplar at Fort Nelson, cut it down and\r\nmade the following measurements of it:—Diameter at stump, exclusive of\r\nbark, twenty-nine inches; at first limb, exclusive of bark, seventeen\r\nand one-half inches; stump to first limb, ninety feet; number of growing\r\nrings, one hundred and forty-five. The bark would add at least four\r\ninches to the diameter.\r\n\r\n                      LARGE TREES OF LIARD VALLEY.\r\n\r\nEntering the valley of the Liard, from the Mackenzie, Mr. Elihu Stewart\r\nsays, there is a good deal of fine large spruce, which would make better\r\nlumber than most of the spruce used in the settled part of the\r\nterritories, but as it is on the Arctic water system it is practically\r\nout of reach. The balsam poplar, or as it is called here, cottonwood, is\r\nvery plentiful and very large, trees nearly four feet in diameter being\r\noften seen, though between two or three feet is the average diameter of\r\nthe trees. These two trees constitute the great mass of the forest. A\r\nfew small white birches are occasionally seen and more frequently the\r\naspen or poplar. There are also, sometimes, a few balsam pines on the\r\ntop of sandy knolls.\r\n\r\nA man who had explored the Liard told Mr. Stewart that he had never seen\r\nfiner saw-log timber anywhere. He also said that good birch, which is\r\nhighly prized by the Indians for bark for their canoes, was found there.\r\n\r\nMr. R. G. McConnell, in his report of his explorations in 1887, stated\r\nthat along the lower Liard the trees observed consisted of white spruce,\r\naspen and tall, straight cottonwood, with some Banksian pine and canoe\r\nbirch, and an undergrowth of willows and alders.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Ogilvie the country about Wrigley is wooded. He noticed\r\na spruce log near the post that was twenty inches in diameter. Mr.\r\nOgilvie states in his report: “It may, in short, be said, that away from\r\nthe immediate vicinity of the river, there is no timber of value in the\r\nsense in which the term is used in the east. Below Fort Wrigley, and\r\neven above that point, in some places the banks are low, flat and\r\nswampy, with trees much larger than those on the higher lands, many of\r\nthem being fit to make fairly good lumber.”\r\n\r\nMr. Joseph Keele reported in 1908:—“The timber resources of Gravel\r\nriver (which flows into the Mackenzie from the westward above Fort\r\nNorman) are very moderate, the white and black spruce trees of any\r\nimportance being confined to the alluvial flats, which on this river are\r\nvery limited in extent, and the best white groves average about ten\r\ninches in diameter. Generally very few trees grow higher than about one\r\nthousand feet above the river, owing to the steep slopes of rock and\r\ntalus of the valley walls.”\r\n\r\n                          FORT NORMAN REGION.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Preble, the white spruce on the Mackenzie does not\r\nattain the size reached farther south, but is still a stately tree. One\r\nmeasured by Richardson on the Mackenzie above Fort Norman was one\r\nhundred and twenty-two feet in height. On the alluvial banks and islands\r\nof lower Mackenzie and Peel rivers it attains a diameter of eighteen\r\ninches. On the northern slopes of the mountains near the mouth of the\r\nNahanni this tree ascends to timberline, but above an altitude of five\r\nhundred feet seldom exceeds a height of twenty-five feet.\r\n\r\nAs has been already said, the general aspect of the forest does not\r\nalter in the descent of the Mackenzie. The white spruce continues to be\r\nthe chief tree. In the Fort Norman quarter (speaking generally) it\r\nattains a girth of four or five feet, and a height of about sixty in a\r\ngrowth of from two to three hundred years, as shown by the annual layers\r\nof wood. One tree, cut down in a sheltered valley near Clark’s hill,\r\nsouth of Great Bear river which flows into the Mackenzie at Fort Norman,\r\nmeasured the unusual length of one hundred and twenty-two feet, but was\r\ncomparatively slender. Most of the timber is twisted, particularly where\r\nthe trees grow in exposed situations. The Banksian pine was not traced\r\nto the north of Great Bear river, but the black spruce, in a stunted\r\nform, is found on the borders of swamps as far as the woods extend.\r\n\r\nGreat Bear river is described by J. M. Bell (Geological Survey Report\r\n1904) as follows:—“The clear waters of Great Bear river join the\r\nMackenzie through a deep wooded valley. For the first forty miles the\r\nbanks are well wooded with white spruce, canoe birch, aspen and balsam\r\npoplar. Mount Charles rises to a height of one thousand five hundred\r\nfeet on the left side of the river. In climbing the hill I was surprised\r\nat the size of the trees around its lower slope. White spruce of about\r\ntwenty inches diameter were quite common as well as fine specimens of\r\ncanoe-birch, balsam, poplar and aspen. At the lake the country is quite\r\ndestitute of trees, as they have all been used for fuel by the Indians.”\r\n\r\nDoctor Dawson stated before the Senate committee of 1888 that Richardson\r\nhad described the white spruce as attaining a girth of four or five\r\nfeet, and a height of sixty feet in Mackenzie valley as far north as\r\nBear lake river. One tree in that locality measured one hundred and\r\ntwenty-two feet in height. It appeared that the white spruce was the\r\nmost prevalent tree throughout Mackenzie valley, and its wood was fairly\r\ngood for all constructive purposes.\r\n\r\n                           THE BLACK SPRUCE.\r\n\r\nMr. McConnell (Senate Committee Report, 1888) says that jackpine occurs\r\nin places as far north as Fort Good Hope. Although not growing very\r\nlarge some of the trees would be big enough for railway ties. He\r\nexplained that the country is not forest continually as it is here\r\n(Ontario), but most of the country is open wood. Nearly all the muskegs\r\nare covered with, or surrounded by, black spruce. Mr. McConnell agrees\r\nwith other travellers of this region in saying that very little change\r\nin the character of the forest was observed in descending the Mackenzie,\r\nand with the exception of the Banksian pine, which disappears south of\r\nBear river, the same species as previously noticed by Richardson are\r\nfound from Great Slave lake to the mouth of Peel river.\r\n\r\nThe Mackenzie has no rapids suitable for waterpower, but the streams\r\nflowing into it must have.\r\n\r\nMr. Preble says of the black spruce (_Picea Mariana_):—“The black\r\nspruce extends northward to the limit of the forest, but is confined\r\nmainly to the muskegs, seldom growing on the alluvial bottom lands,\r\nwhere the white spruce attains its perfection. It furnishes a poorer\r\nquality of lumber than the white spruce, and is put to fewer uses. I\r\nnoted it in places all along the main route to the mouth of the\r\nMackenzie and on my canoe route to the eastward, nearly to Great Bear\r\nlake.”\r\n\r\nMr. McConnell (Geol. Survey Report 1887-88) reports that along part of\r\nthe reach of the Mackenzie below Fort Good Hope the banks are low, and\r\nthe bordering plains are covered with a scattered growth of willow,\r\nspruce and tamarack, with here and there patches of aspen on the drier\r\nridges. The spruce along part of this reach presents a remarkably\r\nstunted and dwarfish appearance, but this is due more to the marshy\r\ncharacter of the ground than to climatic severity, as the same tree,\r\nstraight and well grown, was found much farther north.\r\n\r\n                         BELOW FORT GOOD HOPE.\r\n\r\nMr. McConnell reports that the Mackenzie below the site of old Fort Good\r\nHope, where the stream takes a sharp turn to the west-south west, as far\r\nas the mouth of Red river, is bordered by wooded plains. Groves of white\r\nspruce were seen along this reach, containing trees measuring over\r\nfifteen inches in diameter, but the average tree does not exceed six\r\ninches. Mr. Stewart says that on an island near Fort Good Hope very good\r\nspruce timber is cut into lumber by whipsaws. Below this the timber\r\nseems to get poorer, although it improves again farther north. Mr.\r\nStewart says that below Fort Good Hope the timber is smaller although\r\nsome of it has been made into flooring and lumber is made from the\r\ntimber there. There is a large supply of spruce suitable for pulp.\r\n\r\nNortheast of Fort Good Hope, through a chain of lakes to the headwaters\r\nof Iroquois river, R. MacFarlane (Canadian Record of Science, vol. IV.)\r\nsays that the country appeared to be well timbered in every direction\r\nwith pines, juniper, several species of willow, and a few small groves\r\nof poplar and birch.\r\n\r\nOn the Mackenzie itself the forest continues to within a comparatively\r\nshort distance from the Arctic ocean. The following extract is from Sir\r\nJohn Richardson’s journal in 1848:—“The agency of man is working a\r\nchange in the aspect of the forest even in the thinly peopled north. The\r\nwoods are wasted by extensive fires, kindled accidentally or\r\nintentionally, which spread with rapidity over a wide extent of country,\r\nand continue to burn until they are extinguished by heavy rains. These\r\nconflagrations consume even the soil of the drier tracts, and the bare\r\nand whitened rocks testify for centuries to the havoc that has been\r\nmade. A new growth of timber, however, sooner or later springs up, and\r\nthe soil, when not wholly consumed, being saturated with alkali, gives\r\nbirth to a thicket of aspen instead of the aboriginal spruce.”\r\n\r\n                       WITHIN THE ARCTIC CIRCLE.\r\n\r\nMr. Elihu Stewart explained before the Senate committee of 1907 that\r\nspruce suitable for commercial purposes grows to Arctic sea. He was\r\nastonished to find that the limit of tree growth extended as far north\r\nas it does. He thought it extended probably ten degrees, or nearly seven\r\nhundred miles farther north in this district than in Labrador. The\r\ndifferent kinds of trees that we have in Mackenzie basin include white\r\nspruce, black spruce, the larch or tamarack, which is found as far north\r\nas the spruce, the jackpine and the balsam. Mr. Stewart did not see any\r\nbalsam in the Arctic circle, but aspen, white poplar, balm of Gilead and\r\nbirch are all found down as far as Fort McPherson near the delta of the\r\nMackenzie.\r\n\r\nMr. Ogilvie states in his report:—“On the lower Mackenzie, the timber\r\nlarge enough for commercial or manufacturing purposes is all in the\r\nriver valley. On the plains above, the trees are small and unfit for\r\nanything except for fuel or the few uses to which trees six to seven\r\ninches in diameter can be applied. There is some fine material for\r\nlumber on some of the islands in the river, but many are bare, with the\r\nexception of a few willows.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. R. G. McConnell’s report:—“From the head of the delta\r\nof the Mackenzie the coast is low and sandy, and is exposed to the full\r\nrigour of the arctic storms, and the general vegetation of the bordering\r\nplains is stunted and diminutive in appearance, but is relieved by the\r\npresence of a few large spruce trees, which look like survivors from an\r\nancient and more luxuriant forest. Some of these trees have a girth of\r\nover six feet, and are tall and well shaped, while the average spruce in\r\nthis latitude does not exceed six or seven inches in diameter.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spruce Timber on Peel river inside the Arctic Circle.]\r\n\r\n                          TIMBER OF THE DELTA.\r\n\r\nSir John Richardson descended the delta to the ocean in 1848, and the\r\nfollowing is his account of the timber:—\r\n\r\n“Most of the islands constituting the delta of the Mackenzie are\r\nalluvial and many of the smaller ones are merely a ring of white spruce\r\ntrees and willows on a sand or mud bank. Twenty-two miles below Point\r\nSeparation the banks of the river and the numerous islands are well\r\nwooded. The balsam poplars rise to the height of twenty feet and the\r\nwhite spruce to forty or fifty feet. At the creek which bounds Harrison\r\nisland on the north, the valleys and borders of the river are well\r\nwooded, but the summits of the eminence present only scattered spruce\r\nfirs, with stunted tips and widely spreading depressed lower branches.\r\nThe canoe-birch is frequent, and the trees we measured were about five\r\ninches in diameter. The balsam poplar grows to the height of twenty\r\nfeet. In latitude 68° 55′ north, the trees disappeared so suddenly that\r\nI could not but attribute their cessation to the influence of the\r\nsea-air. Beyond this line a few stunted spruces only were seen\r\nstruggling for existence and some scrubby canoe-birches clinging to the\r\nbases of the hills.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Elihu Stewart’s official report “At Point Separation,\r\nwhich lies between the junction of Mackenzie and Peel rivers, and where\r\nFranklin and Richardson were camped, are two spruce trees, which were\r\nmarked as lob-sticks at the time of their separation and in\r\ncommemoration of that event. Both are still standing (1906), though one\r\nof them is dead. Judging from their appearance at a distance, I would\r\nsay that they are about sixteen inches in diameter and seventy feet in\r\nheight, and this nearly one hundred miles _beyond_ the Arctic circle. I\r\nhave been very much interested in the tenacity of life shown in the\r\ngrowth of trees under the adverse conditions prevailing in this north\r\ncountry. Since crossing the Arctic circle we have seen no vegetation,\r\nbut trees such as the spruce, birch, tamarack and willow are seen all\r\nthe way.” Mr. Stewart adds that as his boat rounded Point Separation and\r\nascended Peel river he noticed that spruce lined the banks.\r\n\r\nMr. Alfred H. Harrison, in his book “In Search of a Polar Continent,”\r\ndescribes a visit to these lob-sticks in September 1906:—“After leaving\r\nPoint Separation, we came to a very shallow place about half-way between\r\nthis point and what are called the Lob-Sticks. At the last-named spot\r\nthe river turns sharply to the east. These Lob-Sticks, which are\r\nsupposed to have been trimmed by Commander Pullen some sixty years ago,\r\nare two pine trees. The branches have all been cut off, but the tops\r\nremain. One of them is a very fine old tree, and the other, which is\r\nmuch younger and smaller, stands directly in front of its nobler\r\nbrother.”\r\n\r\n                          ARCTIC GROWN BIRCH.\r\n\r\nMr. Preble points out that along the Mackenzie the canoe birch occurs as\r\nan economically important species even north of the delta.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Stewart, birch about the delta of the Mackenzie attains\r\na size of twelve to sixteen inches and is used at Fort McPherson not\r\nonly for their log buildings, but it is also whip-sawed into lumber for\r\ngeneral use, and the birch bark here is used by the Indians for their\r\ncanoes. For a distance of a few miles from the Peel the country is\r\npartially wooded with spruce, birch, balsam-poplar and willow, but after\r\nthis the only timber is that found skirting the shores of the small\r\nstreams on the way. A fringe of timber, mostly small spruce, lines the\r\nbanks of the Bell, but apparently does not extend far back.\r\n\r\nMr. Malcolm Macleod, in his statement to the Senate committee of 1888,\r\nsaid:—“As to the wood of that far north I would observe that it is\r\nremarkably hard. I have a pair of snowshoes of peculiar shape, made\r\nright and left, of birch for frame, like iron in texture, and though\r\nperhaps about a hundred years old, perfectly sound.”\r\n\r\nThe frozen subsoil of the northern portions of the woodland country does\r\nnot prevent the timber from attaining a good size, for the roots of the\r\nwhite spruce spread over the icy substratum as they would over smooth\r\nrock. As may be expected, however, the growth of trees is slow in the\r\nhigh latitudes. On the borders of Great Bear lake, four hundred years\r\n(according to Sir John Richardson) are required to bring the stem of the\r\nwhite spruce to the thickness of a man’s waist. When the tree is exposed\r\nto high winds, the fibres of the wood are spirally twisted, but in\r\nsheltered places, or in the midst of the forest, the grain is straight\r\nand the wood splits freely.\r\n\r\n                        GREAT BEAR LAKE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nAs to the country about Great Bear lake and its tributaries, Sir John\r\nRichardson, in 1826, reported that there were pine trees in clumps on\r\nDease river, and the valley to the north was well wooded.\r\n\r\nMr. Malcolm Macleod informed the Senate committee of 1888 that in a\r\nletter of Thomas Simpson to his father he says that the wood at Fort\r\nConfidence had been found suitable for house and boat building. Doctor\r\nJ. M. Bell says that the location of Fort Confidence was one of the few\r\nwell wooded spots in Great Bear lake and the trees are fine specimens\r\nworthy of a more southern latitude.\r\n\r\nBetween Keith bay and Smith bay, Doctor J. M. Bell found a small lake\r\nwell wooded with white spruce, willows and alders, but none of them of\r\ngreat size. Here he saw the most northern specimen of white birch. The\r\nsurrounding country was wooded in the valleys. It was, he says, a\r\npleasing change from the cheerless, gravelly, treeless shores, to reach\r\nLimestone point thirty miles west of Fort Confidence, with its\r\npronounced shore-line and white spruce in the bay. West of Fort\r\nConfidence along the coast of Dease bay for some distance the deep bays\r\nare well wooded, but towards Cape McDonnell the land gets barren and\r\ncontinues so till the coast turns east again where the trees improve.\r\n\r\n“Some forty-five miles east of Cape McDonnell,” says Doctor Bell, “a\r\ngood sized river enters, probably the Takaatcho. Near its mouth,” he\r\nsays, “we found great quantities of driftwood among which were some\r\ngood-sized trunks. I was rather surprised to see these, but learned\r\nafterwards that in the interior the valley of this river is well wooded.\r\nAll the eastern shore of McTavish bay is wooded. In the valleys in the\r\ninterior and around the bays and sheltered channels this timber may be\r\nof economic importance. White spruce is the prevailing forest tree,\r\nalthough canoe-birch is found as far north as Eda Travers bay, and is\r\nsufficiently large in Klarondesk bay to permit of its bark being used\r\nfor making canoes. Tamarack and both balsam poplar and aspen abound in\r\nKlarondesk bay, although not of any great size.”\r\n\r\nSouth of this, the eastern part of the lake, Doctor Bell describes\r\nCamsell river and chain of lakes as all well wooded. At Lake Ray\r\nBanksian pine was noticed.\r\n\r\n                 TREES A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS OLD.\r\n\r\nSir John Franklin, in his description of the country around Fort\r\nFranklin on Great Bear lake (1825), wrote:—“The trees at some distance\r\nfrom our fort consisted of black and white spruce, and larch, generally\r\nsmall, though a few of the better grown measured from four to five feet\r\nin girth, and were from fifty to fifty-five feet high. Doctor Richardson\r\nascertained, by counting the annual rings, that some of them, in a sound\r\nstate, were upwards of one hundred and thirty years old, while others\r\nwhich were not much greater in size, had two hundred and fifty rings,\r\nbut these were decayed at the heart.”\r\n\r\nMr. E. A. Preble of the United States Biological Survey, the most recent\r\nscientific explorer of Great Bear lake and its basin, in his report,\r\nstates:—\r\n\r\n“The northern shores of Great Bear lake are mainly low and thinly\r\nwooded, although the country at some distance inland is better wooded.\r\nThe tributaries of Great Bear lake are comparatively few in number.\r\nDease river, which discharges into the northeastern extremity of the\r\nlake, is probably the best known of its feeders. It rises on the\r\ntreeless height of land between Dease bay and the lower Coppermine.\r\nSeveral important streams enter the lake from the north. Several others\r\ndraining a very large extent of country to the southward enter MacTavish\r\nand McVicar bays. The latter receives also the waters of a chain of\r\nlarge lakes lying north of Marten lake, which discharges into Great\r\nSlave lake. The country drained by the southern tributaries is very\r\nrough and rocky, though fairly well wooded, and is traversed in various\r\ndirections by ranges of low mountains.\r\n\r\n“The southern and western shores are well wooded, while its northern and\r\neastern borders are more thinly forested. The immediate shores are\r\nmainly of sand or gravel and are usually devoid of trees, but are well\r\nclothed with willows and various ericaceous shrubs and herbaceous\r\nplants. In most places along the south shore this treeless stretch is\r\nonly a few hundred yards in width, and in the bays the forest extends to\r\nthe water’s edge. In the vicinity of Leith point, however, a treeless\r\narea stretches from near MacTavish bay to McVicar bay, and extends\r\ninland for several miles. On this area the faunal and floral conditions\r\nare practically those of the Barren Grounds.”\r\n\r\n                     THE SPRUCE OF GREAT BEAR LAKE.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Preble, along the southern shore of Great Bear lake,\r\nthe white spruce “forms the bulk of the forest. In exposed situations\r\nnear Leith point it is somewhat dwarfed, seldom exceeding a diameter of\r\none foot and a maximum height of forty feet. A few miles back from the\r\nshore, in slightly more favourable locations, trees two feet in diameter\r\nat the base were seen, but none of these exceeded thirty feet in height.\r\nA tree twelve inches in diameter growing in an exposed situation near\r\nthe shore had two hundred and fifty-seven annual rings. In this specimen\r\nthe outer layers were exceedingly thin and could be counted only by the\r\naid of a fine-pointed needle. At this rate, the age of a tree of twice\r\nthis diameter can scarcely be estimated at less than one thousand years.\r\nFarther west along the shore the species attains greater perfection of\r\nhabit, especially in some of the sheltered bays. At Fort Franklin it is\r\nthe commonest tree, but at present is represented by scarcely any\r\nindividuals of the original forest, which has been removed for building\r\npurposes. Trees over eight or nine inches in diameter are rare. A\r\nsapling four feet in height and one inch in diameter, on the site of\r\nFort Franklin, had been growing for thirteen years.”\r\n\r\n                       THE SITE OF FORT FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\n“The country about Fort Franklin (which Mr. Preble visited September 16,\r\n1903) is slightly undulating, and except for certain semibarren points\r\nnear the shores of the lake, is well wooded with spruce, tamarack,\r\nwillow, and the usual sub-arctic vegetation. Much of the ground is\r\ncovered with lichens of the genus _Gyrophora_ and various mosses. At the\r\ntime of our visit the leaves of the tamaracks, willows, and other\r\ndeciduous trees were falling. The site of the post itself is the summit\r\nof a rather steep bank elevated about fifty feet above the shores of the\r\nlake. The buildings have long since been destroyed, and only the debris\r\nof the stone chimneys and the faint outlines of the sills of the\r\nprincipal houses now remain to mark the spot. The original clearing is\r\npartially grown up to willows, but much of the ground supports only a\r\ngrowth of grasses and herbaceous plants. The site overlooks, to the\r\nsouthward, the broad expanse of Keith bay, at the extremity of which at\r\na distance of four or five miles, Bear river has its efflux.\r\n\r\n“The banks at the head of Bear river are low, but rapidly increase in\r\nheight. The bordering country is mainly swampy and is well wooded. The\r\nmore gently sloping banks are grassy or wooded, and a dwarf willow\r\n(_Salix reticulata_) is a conspicuous shrub for some distance below the\r\nlake.”\r\n\r\nMr. Preble reports the Koch tamarack (_Larix Laricina_) as “rather\r\ncommon along the southern shores of Great Bear lake, where the large\r\nstone seen, near Leith point, was about twelve inches in thickness at\r\nthe base, but was not over thirty feet in height. While travelling along\r\nthis shore in the autumn of 1903, I first noted the leaves of the\r\nspecies beginning to change colour on September 12, near McVicar bay.\r\nTwo days later its yellow foliage gave a decided impress on the scenery.\r\nOn September 18, at Fort Franklin, its leaves were dropping, and soon\r\nafterwards the trees were bare.”\r\n\r\nMr. Preble states that along the southern shores of Great Bear lake the\r\ncanoe birch occurs only in a somewhat dwarfed state, but it reappears as\r\na fair sized tree on Bear river.\r\n\r\n                      THE BASIN OF ANDERSON RIVER.\r\n\r\nMr. R. MacFarlane, chief factor Hudson’s Bay Company, was sent in 1857\r\nby James Anderson to explore Anderson river. The report of his trip was\r\npublished in the Canadian Record of Science, vol. iv., and the following\r\nnotes therefrom give some idea of the timber along the rivers and lakes\r\ndraining the country north of Great Bear lake into Arctic ocean:—At\r\nCanoe lake, the headwaters of Iroquois river, the main tributary of the\r\nLockhart, the country is tolerably wooded. The batiks of the Iroquois\r\nseem to be all wooded, as Mr. MacFarlane found the navigation impeded by\r\nimmense quantities of driftwood, and he says the ridges on both sides\r\nwere well covered with pine and willow.\r\n\r\nThe country along Lockhart river below the Iroquois is better timbered.\r\nOn the banks of the Anderson below the Lockhart, there is timber of\r\nmedium size gradually disappearing towards the north.\r\n\r\nOn his return trip Mr. MacFarlane proceeded up the Anderson from the\r\nLockhart and found the banks well wooded. Further on, near a succession\r\nof rapids, he found the banks tolerably wooded. He says:—“The country\r\nalong the Anderson was latterly very well wooded, and some goodly pines\r\nwere seen. The tract of country embraced by a line drawn west from the\r\nborders of the woods on the Anderson to the Mackenzie, southward to Peau\r\nde Lièvre river (Hare Indian river), at Good Hope, is very well\r\ntimbered.\r\n\r\nHe says the banks of Ross river are partially timbered. A chain of well\r\nwooded hills, Mr. MacFarlane says, encircle Colville lake or more\r\nprobably the large lake west of the lake marked Colville. The banks of\r\nSimpson lake are well timbered. From here southwest towards Hare Indian\r\nriver, Mr. MacFarlane found the country well wooded. He says “the timber\r\nconsists of pine, juniper, fir, willow, and a few groves of poplar and\r\nbirch. Some of the pines were of a large size. The belt of timber which\r\nat Fort Anderson extends for over thirty miles to the eastward, rapidly\r\nnarrows and becomes a mere fringe along Anderson river, and disappears\r\nto the northward of the 69th parallel of latitude.”\r\n\r\nRunning parallel with Anderson river is MacFarlane or Wilmot Horton\r\nriver. Mr. MacFarlane says that one or two intersecting affluents of\r\nWilmot Horton or MacFarlane river flow through valleys in which a few\r\nstunted spruce, birch and willows appear at intervals. On the banks of\r\none of these, near its mouth, he observed a sheltered grove of spruce\r\nand willows of larger growth. They met with no more spruce to the\r\neastward.\r\n\r\nMr. Preble passed up Lockhart river, and thus describes the stream and\r\nits banks:—“Our route lay up the left fork. The shores here are low and\r\nthe channels winding, and much obstructed by fallen trees. Above here we\r\npaddled through several small marshy ponds and portaged past a small\r\nfall. We then passed through a rocky defile above which we made four\r\nportages, and ascended several small riffles with paddles or with the\r\nhelp of the line. On August 3 we avoided eight falls or rapids by making\r\nportages and ascended several others with the line. At the last rapid,\r\nwhere we encamped, the river rushes for a hundred yards through a rocky\r\ngorge. The spruce woods about here have escaped the fires which have\r\ndevastated most of this section. Some of the small ponds and channels\r\npassed through were bordered by banks of clay, clothed mainly with white\r\nbirch.”\r\n\r\nMr. Preble states that the belt of timber which at Fort Anderson extends\r\nfor over thirty miles to the eastward, rapidly narrows and becomes a\r\nmere fringe along Anderson river, and disappears to the northward of the\r\n68th parallel of latitude.\r\n\r\nMr. Hanbury reports that he found Dease river (east of Great Bear lake)\r\nto be completely concealed by a heavy belt of spruce.\r\n\r\n                 HOW TO INCREASE NORTHERN TREE GROWTH.\r\n\r\nIn a letter published in the _Ottawa Journal_ on February 19, 1910, Mr.\r\nWilliam Ogilvie, the well-known surveyor and explorer, and ex-governor\r\nof the Yukon, wrote, in speaking of Athabaska and Mackenzie\r\nregions:—“As time goes on much increase to the commercial timber area\r\nmight be made by draining the swamps, and drying the moss on the surface\r\nwhich now keeps the ground beneath cool, indeed preserving the frost in\r\nit during the whole summer. Once dried the moss would die, and instead\r\nof keeping the ground cool would absorb heat and help to warm it. Anyone\r\nwho has travelled in the north cannot help noting the difference in the\r\nsize of the timber on mossy ground, as compared with that where there is\r\nno moss. On mossy ground you will see trees from one hundred to two\r\nhundred years old, according to the annual growth rings, only three,\r\nfour or five inches in diameter, while only a few yards away where there\r\nis no moss or moisture, trees of seventy and eighty years’ growth will\r\nbe nearly a foot in diameter, and of a different quality of lumber.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Anglican Church, School and Rectory at Fort Simpson.]\r\n\r\nIn the same communication Mr. Ogilvie wrote:—“Those who have never seen\r\na northwest forest, when told of it, naturally compare it with others\r\nthey have seen, but one from the eastern parts of Canada would find a\r\ngreat difference between his native woods and those of the northwest.\r\nThe varieties of trees are fewer, and smaller in size, than those in the\r\neast and south. Of varieties the principal are spruce and poplar; of the\r\npoplar there are two kinds, one of which, the balsam poplar, in some\r\nplaces grows to be a very large size. On the lower stretches of Liard\r\nriver I have seen them well over four feet in diameter, stump high, but\r\ngenerally such large ones are unsound and full of cracks. The other kind\r\nseldom grows more than a foot thick, and the trunk is seldom suitable\r\nfor turning out lumber.\r\n\r\n                       THE SPRUCE BEARS THE PALM.\r\n\r\n“When dry it makes good fuel but is not comparable as a heat producer\r\nwith the eastern hardwoods. As commercial lumber the spruce bears the\r\npalm, metaphorically, as well as literally. It seldom grows to more than\r\nfifteen to seventeen inches in diameter near the ground, and where it\r\nstands thickly together grows to a good height with straight tapering\r\ntrunk, but where scattered it is not so long nor so graceful,\r\nconsequently less useful. It supplies all the lumber for local demand\r\nall over the northwest, and north, and is found from the forty-ninth\r\nparallel of latitude to Arctic ocean, and on the alluvial flats of\r\nMackenzie delta I have seen specimens about as large as any I have\r\nnoticed elsewhere in the territories. The other varieties of trees are\r\nso few and far between that they are hardly worth mentioning except\r\nwhite-birch which is found all over, but is seldom of sufficient size or\r\nshape to be useful. I have seen a few tamaracks at odd spots, and on the\r\nAthabaska I saw a small grove of Canada balsams, the only place I ever\r\nsaw them in the northwest. They seemed as vigorous as any I ever saw,\r\nwhich proves that they would grow there if given the opportunity, and if\r\nthey, why not other specimens of our more southern trees. It has often\r\noccurred to me that it would be well to try planting our white pines and\r\nother commercial trees in those northern forests, to see if they would\r\nnaturalize, and if so, increase greatly the value of the northern\r\ndomain. It would cost very little to do it, and a fostering care of them\r\nmight by selection at last make a success of the experiment, if it did\r\nnot succeed from the start.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[23] Fort Enterprise is a little east of the eastern limit, of the tract\r\nof country defined in a preceding chapter; but as it is in the Mackenzie\r\nwatershed, it may well be treated of in this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE MACKENZIE RIVER REGION.\r\n\r\n                           Economic Minerals.\r\n\r\n   The Territory Has Never Been Thoroughly Examined for Minerals.—\r\n     Tar Springs on the North Shore of Great Slave lake.—The\r\n     Devonian Rocks Throughout Mackenzie valley are Nearly Everywhere\r\n     More or Less Petroliferous.—Lignite Discovered in Many Places,\r\n     Also Gypsum.—Large Deposits of Excellent Salt.—Indications of\r\n     Gold and Copper.—Indians Report Finding Mica.\r\n\r\nEver since Sir Alexander Mackenzie first passed down the river which now\r\nbears his name on his famous voyage of discovery in 1789, and described\r\nthe burning beds of coal and the salt springs along its banks, the\r\ndistrict now under review in these pages has excited the interest of the\r\ngeologist and the prospector, but on account of the remoteness of the\r\ncountry from civilized settlement and the difficulties of transport,\r\nvery little, comparatively, is known of the actual extent of mineral\r\nwealth of this immense area of country. True, expert explorers like Sir\r\nJohn Franklin, Sir John Richardson, Mr. R. G. McConnell, Mr. William\r\nOgilvie, and Doctor J. M. Bell have conducted scientific surveys along\r\nthe chief waterways and over some routes overland, and their reports\r\nhave been splendid and valuable, but from scantiness of their equipment\r\nand the omnipresent necessity to economize time, these surveys, from a\r\ngeological point of view, can be considered only as reconnaissances.\r\n\r\nComparatively brief summaries of what some of these explorers and some\r\nothers have written and said as to the mineralogy of Mackenzie valley\r\nbelow the 60th parallel of latitude, will suffice to give an idea of\r\nwhat we really know on the subject.\r\n\r\nDuring his explorations about Great Slave lake in 1887, Mr. R. G.\r\nMcConnell, of the Geological Survey, inspected the tar springs on the\r\nnorth shore. The springs are situated a couple of hundred yards from the\r\nshore, at the base of a low limestone cliff, which runs inland from the\r\nlake, and are three in number, each of them being surrounded with a\r\nsmall basin, three to four feet in diameter, filled with inspissated\r\nbitumen, while the soil and moss for some distance away is impregnated\r\nwith the same material. A small quantity of pitch is annually taken from\r\nthese springs and used for boat building purposes, while a much larger\r\nsupply could be obtained if needed. A sulphur spring resembling those at\r\nSulphur point on the south shore of the lake, but much more copious,\r\nissues from the foot of the cliff in close proximity to the bituminous\r\nsprings, and feeds a considerable stream. The rock through which the\r\npetroleum ascends here is a heavily bedded greyish, rather coarsely\r\ncrystalline cavernous dolomite, and is entirely unlike the bituminous\r\nbeds south of the lake and down the Mackenzie, which in most cases\r\nconsist of calcareous shales. The dolomite is everywhere permeated with\r\nbituminous matter, which collects in the numerous cavities, and oozing\r\nup through cracks, often forms small pools on the surface of the rock.\r\n\r\nIt was also reported to Mr. McConnell that sulphur and tar springs occur\r\nat a point half way between the springs he visited and Fort Rae. On the\r\nsouth shore bituminous shales and limestones outcrop at several points,\r\nand it would thus appear, according to Mr. McConnell, that the\r\noil-bearing beds underlie the whole western part of the lake.\r\n\r\n                     PROMISING INDICATIONS OF OIL.\r\n\r\nThe Devonian rocks throughout Mackenzie valley, Mr. McConnell reports,\r\nare nearly everywhere more or less petroliferous, and over large areas\r\nafford promising indications of the presence of oil in workable\r\nquantities. He states that he noticed, in descending the Mackenzie, that\r\nbituminous limestones outcropped at the “Rock by the River Side”, at\r\nBear Rock, at the Ramparts, and at numerous other places. Near Fort Good\r\nHope several tar springs exist, and it is from these that the Hudson’s\r\nBay Company now obtain their principal supply of pitch. The springs are\r\nsituated at some distance from the river and were not examined. Still\r\nfarther down, in the vicinity of the site of old Fort Good Hope, the\r\nriver is bordered for several miles by evenly bedded dark shales of\r\nDevonian age which are completely saturated with oil. The possible oil\r\ncountry along Mackenzie valley, he concludes, is almost co-extensive\r\nwith that of the valley itself. On the Mackenzie, the Tertiary beds at\r\nthe mouth of Bear river hold several seams of lignite, ranging in\r\nthickness from two to four feet, and one seam which was concealed at the\r\ntime of Mr. McConnell’s visit is reported by Richardson to be nine feet\r\nthick. The lignite there is of inferior quality, and has been burnt in\r\nmany places for some distance from the surface by fires which have been\r\nin existence since the river was first discovered. Gypsum occurs in\r\nlarge quantities in the Devonian rocks of Bear mountain at the mouth of\r\nBear river.\r\n\r\n                      DEPOSITS OF EXCELLENT SALT.\r\n\r\nMr. McConnell also explored part of Salt river in 1887. He\r\nreported:—“Several salt springs drain into Salt river, near Fort Smith,\r\nabout twenty-five miles above its mouth. The springs are enclosed by\r\nsmall evaporating basins, the largest of which is about fifteen feet in\r\ndiameter, and is crusted with a remarkably pure deposit of sodic\r\nchloride. The salt obtained here is of excellent quality, and has been\r\nused in Mackenzie river district for many years. Salt is also reported\r\nto occur on the headwaters of a small stream which enters the Mackenzie\r\nabout fifteen miles above Fort Norman.”\r\n\r\nMr. McConnell in 1887 examined the Nahanni Butte at the junction of\r\nNahanni river with the Liard, below Fort Liard, and he states that\r\ncopper stains were noted in a number of places, but no specimens\r\nindicating deposits of economic value were obtained.\r\n\r\nIn his 1893 report regarding his investigation of the Athabaska\r\ntar-sand-petroleum deposits, Mr. McConnell mentioned, as indicating the\r\npresence of petroleum deposits over an immense area, that north of\r\nAthabaska district “tar occurs at intervals in the Devonian limestone\r\nexposed along the valleys of Slave river and the Mackenzie, all the way\r\nto Arctic ocean.”\r\n\r\n                   SOME NOTES BY REV. FATHER PETITOT.\r\n\r\nProfessor Robert Bell submitted to the Senate committee of 1888 a letter\r\nreceived from Rev. Father Petitot, O.M.I., of Fort Good Hope, dated\r\nAugust 16, 1873, in reply to a letter from Professor Bell, written May\r\n30, the previous year.\r\n\r\nThe reverend gentleman explained in his letter that he had travelled\r\nextensively through this vast region, and proceeded to give a most\r\ninteresting geological account of the country, although he undoubtedly\r\ndisclaimed any merit as a geologist.\r\n\r\nPoints of practical interest to which attention was drawn in this\r\ncommunication were the following:—\r\n\r\n“To the south and to the east of the banks of Great Slave lake are\r\nflats, composed of alluvium and gravel. On the islands off shore asphalt\r\nis found, the hardened debris of which is strewn on the beach.\r\n\r\n“Six miles above Fort Norman, and for an extent of from eight to ten\r\nmiles, the Mackenzie is bounded on its right bank by a precipice which\r\nreaches at first about one hundred and fifty feet in height, and\r\ngradually diminishes to a height of thirty feet. It is a vast Tertiary\r\ndeposit composed of alternate stratifications of friable schist,\r\nlignite, pipe-clay and vegetable mould. The schists are in a state of\r\ncombustion winter and summer, but the subterranean fire which shows\r\nitself on the surface through smoke holes, stinking of bitumen, is\r\nintermittent, and breaks out sometimes at one point, sometimes at\r\nanother. It is not always visible at the surface, but at others is very\r\nactive. The soil is very hot, damp and movable in the neighbourhood of\r\nthese smoke holes.\r\n\r\n                        CRUDE FORMS OF LIGNITE.\r\n\r\n“The lignites are not fit for forging work. Sometimes even the trunks of\r\nthe trees which form the beds of it have been transformed into clay;\r\nhowever, all this debris has evidently undergone the action of fire.\r\n\r\n“Great Bear lake river, or Franklin river, presents alternations of\r\ngranite, limestone, and coal-bearing sandstone.\r\n\r\n“Traces of fire are visible in the mountain range at the mouth of the\r\ndischarge of Great Bear lake. A little lower down, below the rock, the\r\nbeaches of the Emir present unequivocal traces of other schistose holes\r\nwhich have been extinct for a long time, but which the writer of the\r\nletter found in combustion in 1869.\r\n\r\n“The left bank of the Mackenzie, opposite Rocher Rouge, exudes\r\nferruginous water, which stains all the water-borne shingle of the beach\r\nwith oxide of iron. Three or four leagues below Fort Good Hope, iron\r\npyrites is found on the beach, and the Peaux de Lièvre Indians formerly\r\nused it in striking fire.\r\n\r\n“On the right bank opposite the site of the old Fort Good Hope, there\r\nare natural ramparts of limestone or schistose sandstone at the mouth of\r\nThunder river. One finds there hematite, or oxide of iron; sulphate of\r\niron and sulphate of magnesia; alum, which exudes from the fissures in\r\nthe stone; and red ochre. It was here that the Peaux de Lièvre Indians\r\ndiscovered in ancient times the hematite, which on account of its\r\ncolour, resembling the dung of the black bear, they called Sa-ts-anne,\r\nthat is to say, bears’ excrement.\r\n\r\n                       EXUDE ALUM AND SALTPETRE.\r\n\r\n“The second ramparts of the Mackenzie, called the Detroit or Narrows,\r\nare composed of lias and limestone, which exude alum and saltpetre.\r\nLower down are schistose sandstones of which the Esquimaux make the\r\nheads of their arrows.\r\n\r\n“On the sea coast and the right bank the Esquimaux have told me that\r\nthere are caves containing fossilized bones of large antediluvian\r\nanimals, particularly of the mastodon, of which they have shown me\r\npieces of tusks of the finest ivory which they call _killagvark_, and\r\nwhich they know how to distinguish from the ivory of the walrus, or\r\n_turark_. They have also told me that there are, upon the sea shore to\r\nthe eastward, Tertiary deposits in combustion, similar to those at Fort\r\nNorman.”\r\n\r\nWriting in his report of the information he had obtained as to the\r\ndeposits of economic minerals in Mackenzie valley, William Ogilvie,\r\nD.L.S., wrote as follows:—“On the Mackenzie, the first coal I heard of\r\nwas a seam of which Mr. McDougall at Chipewyan told me, and which is\r\nsituated in the base of the mountain just above Rapid Sans Sault, on the\r\neast side of the river. He could not give me any details concerning its\r\nextent, more than that he believed it to be about four or five feet\r\nthick, and that it was in the limestone rock of the mountain. If this is\r\ntrue, it indicates that this coal is older than the lignite coal of the\r\ncountry, and probably much harder and better. I did not know of its\r\nexistence until I got to Chipewyan, or I would have tried to have had a\r\nspecimen sent out after me.\r\n\r\n“About three and a half miles above Fort Norman, on the east bank of the\r\nriver, two extensive exposures of lignite crop out. The upper one is\r\noverlaid by about fifty feet of clay and a few feet of friable\r\nsandstone, and is about fifteen feet thick. The other seam is probably\r\nforty feet below this. When I was there it was nearly all under water.\r\nIt is said to be as thick as, if not thicker than, the upper one.\r\n\r\n                      ON FIRE FOR OVER A CENTURY.\r\n\r\n“The upper seam has been on fire for over one hundred years, as it was\r\nburning when Sir Alexander Mackenzie passed in 1789. The place is\r\nlocally known as le Boucan. The fire extends at present about two miles\r\nalong the river, not continuously but at intervals. When I passed, it\r\nwas burning in three or four places. After it has burned a certain\r\ndistance into the seam the overlying mass of clay falls down and, to\r\nsome extent, suppresses the fire. This clay is in time baked into a red\r\ncolored rock, in which are found innumerable impressions of leaves of\r\nplants. Some specimens of these I brought home, and handed to Doctor\r\nDawson. Traces of this red rock were noticed on the bank fourteen miles\r\nbelow Fort Norman, but no trace of lignite was seen near it, having\r\nprobably been all burned.\r\n\r\n“The burning seam appears to be of poor quality, containing much shale\r\nand sand, which is converted by the heat into scoriæ. It did not appear\r\nto me that it would be difficult to cut off all the burning places, and\r\nthus stop the further advance of the fire, which is destroying what yet\r\nmay be of use. In order to find if the combustion could be checked I\r\ntook a shovel at one place and soon had all the burning coal for a short\r\ndistance cut off completely, so that the fire ceased for a time at that\r\nspot. It is a pity that at least an attempt to put out the fire is not\r\nmade. Many persons in that district have an idea that it is\r\nsubterraneous, and that the seat of it cannot be reached. This is a\r\nmistake, as at the point mentioned I cleaned off the fire from the face\r\nof the seam to its base and found underneath no trace of burning. The\r\nlower seam appears to be of better quality, there being no shale or sand\r\nmixed with it, so far as I could see. Heavy rain detained us here for\r\ntwo days, and we burned a good deal of lignite from the lower seam, as\r\nwe could not reach the top of the bank to procure wood, and could find\r\nonly a log or two of driftwood. The coal burned well in the open air,\r\nand threw out a much stronger heat than a wood fire. These seams are\r\nvisible at frequent intervals along the bank for eight and a half miles,\r\nafter which not a trace of them appears for seven miles, where there is\r\nanother small exposure at the water’s edge. This seam appears, from the\r\nreports of many travellers, to extend up Great Bear river for a\r\nconsiderable distance. No other traces of coal were observed on the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n“While at Fort Good Hope I noticed that many of the outbuildings and\r\nfences were painted with a dull red coloring matter, which, on inquiry,\r\nI found consisted of the ashes of wood that had lain in the river for\r\nsome years. It was said poplar trees yielded the best paint and that\r\nlogs that had been in the river long enough were known by the dull blue\r\ncolor of the wood. A sample of the ashes I brought home, and handed to\r\nDoctor Dawson. It may be that the color is due to the presence of oxide\r\nof iron; if so, this would indicate the existence in the water of iron\r\nin solution. But where the iron comes from is a mystery, as none of this\r\npeculiar wood was seen or heard of in the upper river. The inference is\r\nthat the iron occurs far down in the river, but whether in the soil or\r\nin the beds on some of the tributary streams, or whether it is iron at\r\nall, has yet to be determined.\r\n\r\n                          INDIANS REPORT MICA.\r\n\r\n“The Indians report very large deposits of mica on the south side of\r\nGreat Slave lake, and have brought small samples of it to Fort\r\nResolution. While there I tried to get a specimen, but none was\r\navailable. It is described as being very abundant.\r\n\r\n“No other minerals of economic value were seen or heard of, except\r\nbitumen. On the way up (from Fort Providence to Chipewyan) the first\r\nindication of this was seen on Great Slave lake, in the form of the\r\nbituminous limestone which has already been referred to. Tar springs, as\r\nthey are called in the vicinity, exist on the lake. I do not know of any\r\nof them on Slave river, but they abound on the Athabaska from near the\r\ndelta for over two hundred miles up, and one is reported only a few\r\nmiles from Athabaska, less than one hundred miles from Edmonton.”\r\n\r\nMr. von Hamerstein, in his evidence before the select committee of the\r\nSenate in 1907, stated that up the rivers that flow into the Mackenzie\r\nthere are large quantities of native salt thrown up. It is mostly\r\nunderground, and there seems to be a crater. The salt appears to be\r\nclose to the ground in large quantities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Roman Catholic Mission at Fort Resolution.]\r\n\r\nMr. Keele, in the report of his explorations in 1908, states:—“Drift\r\nlignite is found on the lower part of Gravel river, which is no doubt\r\nderived from the Tertiary coal-bearing areas of Mackenzie basin.\r\nHematite occurs on Gravel river about ten miles below the mouth of Natla\r\nriver. This iron ore is coarsely laminated with red siliceous slate,\r\nhaving a thickness of from fifty to one hundred feet, and is interbedded\r\nbetween conglomerate and dolomite. An assay of an average sample of this\r\nore was made at the assay office of the Mines branch, and gave only\r\ntwenty-five per cent. of iron.”\r\n\r\n                   TWO HUNDRED SQUARE MILES OF COAL.\r\n\r\nMr. Brock, Director of the Geological Survey, in his report for 1909,\r\nquoted an estimate made by Mr. D. B. Dowling that the known available\r\ncoal area in Mackenzie district is two hundred square miles,\r\nrepresenting five hundred million tons of lignite.\r\n\r\nTertiary coal is known to exist in large quantities along the Arctic\r\ncoast east of the Mackenzie and in the Arctic islands. Doctor Armstrong\r\nfound it on Banks Land and Doctor Richardson mentions that “the Garry\r\nislands, lying off the Mackenzie, contain beds of a Tertiary coal which\r\ntakes fire spontaneously on exposure to the atmosphere. Higher up the\r\nMackenzie, at the junction of Bear lake river, on the 65th parallel of\r\nlatitude, there is a Tertiary coal deposit of considerable extent, which\r\nyields hand specimens entirely similiar to Garry island ones.”\r\n\r\nIn his annual report for 1911, Superintendent Saunders, D.S.O., of the\r\nRoyal Northwest Mounted Police, commanding the force in the Athabaska,\r\nPeace and Mackenzie countries, wrote:—“Very little progress has been\r\nmade over last year in the development of the mineral resources of the\r\ncountry. Three companies are boring for oil near McMurray but I cannot\r\nascertain that they have met with much success. No work is being done in\r\nconnection with the tar sands although very favourable reports have been\r\nmade as to their value for asphalt and street paving, probably the lack\r\nof transportation facilities is the reason of the delay.\r\n\r\n“From Mackenzie river sub-district I have reports of a few prospectors\r\nin different parts, but of no success. Mr. D. F. McRae, however, who\r\nwent down the Mackenzie in 1910 and went out the same year, has returned\r\nagain with a party and well equipped outfit, consisting of a powerful\r\ngasoline launch, three scows with provisions, two horses, etc. He and\r\none of the other members have their wives with them, and are wintering\r\nnear the mouth of Herschell river. The fact of his having gone back in\r\nthis manner would indicate that he has made a discovery of some kind,\r\nthe nature of which has not been disclosed, as the whole party are very\r\nreticent.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE MACKENZIE RIVER.\r\n\r\n                  Game, Fur-bearing Animals and Fish.\r\n\r\n   Over Forty Moose Killed in one Season Near Fort Simpson.—Caribou\r\n     of both Woodland and Barren Lands Varieties Plentiful.—Pass\r\n     Great Slave lake in Countless Numbers.—Mountain Sheep Plentiful\r\n     in the Mountainous Districts.—Incredible Numbers of Geese,\r\n     Swans and Ducks in Season.—Inexhaustible Supplies of Fish.—The\r\n     Speckled Trout, Lake Trout, Grayling, Herring, Inconnu, etc.\r\n\r\nEveryone who has visited Mackenzie river region seems to have been much\r\nimpressed with the variety and the quantity of the fish and the game\r\nthere, all the books written by the explorers, traders, missionaries and\r\nsportsmen who have visited the country, containing numerous references\r\nto its wonderful resources in this respect. As a matter of fact the fish\r\nand the game of the country have hitherto been and still are the support\r\nof the slender resident population, and will play a very important part\r\nin the ultimate development of the region. Without discussing the\r\ncommercial value of the apparently inexhaustible inland and coastwise\r\nfisheries, it might be pointed out that once settlement begins to flow\r\ninto the country the fine waters and immense game ranges of this huge\r\ncountry will contribute most usefully towards the support of the pioneer\r\nsettlers during the critical period when the local agricultural,\r\nlumbering and mining industries are in their early experimental stages.\r\nUndoubtedly, too, the game and fisheries will contribute, as they have\r\ndone elsewhere, to the ultimate development of the country by attracting\r\nto more remote sections sportsmen who by reason of their natural\r\nintelligence, world experience, education and influential connections,\r\nare sure to discover and to attract attention to natural resources at\r\npresent unthought of.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Fur Shipment of One Season from Mackenzie basin,\r\nestimated value over two million, five hundred thousand dollars.]\r\n\r\nFrequent references have been made in the preceding chapters to the work\r\naccomplished by Mr. E. A. Preble, of the United States Biological\r\nSurvey, in the Mackenzie country in 1901 and 1903, and to his report\r\n“North American Fauna, No. 27,” published by the Biological Survey at\r\nWashington in 1908. In no respect is this altogether admirable report\r\nmore instructive than in its complete references to the game and the\r\nfisheries. Mr. Preble naturally devotes much attention to that monarch\r\namong northern game animals, the moose.\r\n\r\n                          THE MAJESTIC MOOSE.\r\n\r\nMr. Preble points out that “Hearne was the first to record moose from\r\nthe Mackenzie region, finding them ‘very plentiful,’ on the south side\r\nof Great Slave lake, east of the mouth of Slave river, during the winter\r\nof 1771-72, while on his way back to Churchill during his famous journey\r\nof exploration.” Harmon noted their occurrence on the plains of Peace\r\nriver in 1808. “During Franklin’s first northern journey a moose was\r\nkilled near Fort Enterprise in the spring of 1821.” During his second\r\nexpedition moose were killed on Ellice island, near the mouth of the\r\nMackenzie, in the summer of 1825, and near Fort Franklin in September of\r\nthe same year, and in February, 1826. During the spring of 1834, while\r\nBack’s expedition was wintering at Fort Reliance, a moose was killed on\r\n“Fish river” (in all probability the Thelon, or Ark-i-linik) several\r\ndays’ travel east of Great Slave lake. Simpson reports that tracks of\r\nmoose were seen on MacTavish bay, Great Bear lake, during the winter of\r\n1837-38. Ross recorded specimens taken at Fort Good Hope and Fort\r\nSimpson. Lockhart, writing in 1865 on the habits of moose, states that\r\nthey were rarely killed in the vicinity of Fort Rae, though they were\r\nquite numerous at Big island and along the south shore of Great Slave\r\nlake, and that the moose of Peel river and the Yukon are much larger\r\nthan those in Great Slave lake region. While exploring in a country\r\nbetween Athabaska lake and Churchill river in the summer of 1892, J. B.\r\nTyrrell found that the moose occurred throughout the more thickly wooded\r\nparts of the country as far north as Stone river, near the eastern end\r\nof Athabaska lake. Russell states that a moose was killed near the mouth\r\nof Yellowknife river, Great Slave lake, in August 1903. A. J. Stone\r\nrecords the moose from several points in lower Mackenzie valley, giving\r\nevidence as to the large size of the animals found there, and from the\r\nheadwaters of Nahanni river, where they abound.\r\n\r\n“During the early autumn of 1895 a moose was killed by a member of\r\nLoring’s party near the headwaters of McLeod river. In the autumn of\r\n1896, fresh tracks were seen almost daily along the trail between Smoky\r\nriver and Jasper House.\r\n\r\n                       FOUND TO BE RATHER COMMON.\r\n\r\n“In the spring of 1903, while descending Athabaska and Slave rivers to\r\nGreat Slave lake, we saw tracks of moose occasionally, but observed none\r\nof the animals. During their return trip in the fall, however, my\r\nbrother and Cary saw a young one on the Athabaska above Athabaska. In\r\nthe lake country between Fort Rae and Great Bear lake, during my\r\nnorthward trip in the same autumn, the moose was found to be rather\r\ncommon, and became more abundant as we approached Great Bear lake, owing\r\nto the country being better suited to its needs. Tracks were often seen\r\non the portages, and a large bull was observed on an inlet of MacTavish\r\nbay on August 25. Along the southern shore of Great Bear lake we found\r\nit a common and in some places an abundant species. Even in the exposed\r\nand semibarren country in the region of Leith point a few are found, and\r\na female was killed there by my Indian canoeman on September 1. Owing to\r\nthe rocky nature of its haunts, the hoofs of this animal were much worn\r\nand blunted. West of McVicar bay, especially along the base of Grizzly\r\nBear mountain, the species was found to be abundant and numerous fresh\r\ntracks were seen wherever we landed. Its abundance here is partially\r\nexplained by the fact that there are immense areas abounding with its\r\nproper food. A party of natives seen near Manito islands had repeatedly\r\nstarted moose without killing one, while my Dogrib (Indian) canoeman, in\r\na far more difficult country, had secured the only animal he hunted.\r\nMoose are seldom found about Fort Franklin, owing doubtless to the place\r\nhaving been a favourite resort of natives since time immemorial, but\r\nthey are said to be common along Bear river. While ascending the\r\nMackenzie in October we frequently saw fresh tracks.\r\n\r\n                        OVER FORTY MOOSE KILLED.\r\n\r\n“During the winter of 1903-4 upwards of forty moose were killed within\r\ntwenty-five miles of Fort Simpson, and moose meat comprised an important\r\nitem of our food. During a trip down the river in January I saw the\r\ntracks of a band of four or five about thirty miles below Fort Simpson.\r\nAn area of considerable size on the sloping side of the valley, grown up\r\nto willows, had afforded a fine feeding ground, and was well trampled.\r\nThe animals had wandered out on the snowy surface of the river also, and\r\nhad trotted about apparently with no particular aim, perhaps in play.”\r\n\r\nMr. Keele, in the report of his reconnaissance across Mackenzie\r\nmountains, and down the valley of Gravel river to the Mackenzie, in 1907\r\nand 1908, says:—“There are a few moose scattered along the valley of\r\nGravel river, but it is not a good moose country, as there are no small\r\nlakes, and on account of the narrow valleys, and low timber line, the\r\narea over which they can feed is restricted.”\r\n\r\nMr. Preble observed numerous tracks of both moose and bear along the\r\nleft fork of Lockhart river, a tributary of the Anderson.\r\n\r\n                        THE CARIBOU OR CARIBOO.\r\n\r\nMr. Preble also devotes considerable space in his report to information\r\nabout the caribou (often spelled “cariboo”), another of the notable\r\nlarger game animals of this region. He writes:—“Mr. Brabant, of Fort\r\nSmith, informed me that caribou were unusually common in that vicinity\r\nduring the winter of 1902-3. Captain Mills, of the steamer Wrigley, told\r\nme that he saw one on Slave river, near McConnell island, on July 5,\r\n1903. The Dogribs say that a few are found in the country between Fort\r\nRae and Great Bear lake. Along the lower Liard the animals are\r\noccasionally detected in small bands and are often killed. Caribou meat\r\nwas several times brought in to Fort Simpson during my residence there,\r\nbut all my efforts to secure a specimen failed. The natives about there\r\ndistinguish between the wood caribou of the lowlands and those of the\r\nmountains, and say that the former is smaller and lighter in colour than\r\nthe mountain animal. Woodland caribou still occur along the Saskatchewan\r\nnear Edmonton, and E. E. Whitley, who lives on Sandy creek, twenty miles\r\nsouth of Athabaska, Alberta, stated that he had seen a few in that\r\nvicinity.\r\n\r\n                         THE WOODLAND CARIBOU.\r\n\r\n“The presence of the woodland caribou in this region was first noted by\r\nHearne, who refers to the species as ‘Indian Deer.’ During his journey\r\nsouthward from Coppermine river he saw many in the sparsely wooded\r\ncountry north of the eastern part of Great Slave lake in December, 1771.\r\nWhile crossing the lake on the ice he found the wooded islands ‘well\r\nstocked’ with the same species. Deer (caribou) are enumerated by\r\nRichardson among the animals said to inhabit Birch mountain west of\r\nlower Athabaska river. While exploring in the region between Athabaska\r\nlake and Churchill river in the summer of 1892, J. B. Tyrrell\r\nascertained that the woodland caribou was reported ‘to occur in the more\r\nsouthern portion of the district, near Churchill river, but none were\r\nseen.’\r\n\r\n“R. MacFarlane, in a letter to the United States Biological Survey,\r\nwritten in January, 1902, states that the woodland caribou inhabits the\r\ncountry between Lake Winnipeg and Athabaska lake, and though nowhere in\r\nlarge numbers is more abundant on the southern than on the northern\r\nshores of this lake. Between Athabaska and Great Slave lakes he states\r\nthat “the animal is chiefly met with on the west side of Slave river,\r\nand through all the country lying between Peace river and Great Slave\r\nlake.\r\n\r\n                          THE MIGRATORY HERDS.\r\n\r\n“Along the southern shore of Great Bear lake, especially at the point\r\nwhere we reached it on MacTavish bay, numerous well-worn trails testify\r\nto the great numbers of caribou that pass back and forth in spring and\r\nfall. They arrive from the Barren Grounds about the time of the first\r\ndeep snows, usually by the middle of October, and sometimes extend their\r\nmigration west to the outlet of the lake, though they are not common in\r\nthat vicinity. In the spring the greater number return, though a few\r\nremain through the summer on the semibarren areas near Leith point, and\r\nwestward to the vicinity of McVicar bay. We saw fresh tracks of a number\r\nnear our camp east of Leith point during the early days of September.\r\n\r\n“The Hare Indians living about the southern and western shores of Great\r\nBear lake, repair to its eastern end about the end of July, usually\r\ncoasting the southern shore, and spend a month or two among the caribou\r\non the treeless country between the eastern end of the lake and the\r\nlower Coppermine, returning to their winter hunting grounds early in\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n“During the winter of 1903-4, caribou reached the Northern Arm and the\r\neastern part of Great Slave lake in great numbers and some were killed\r\nwithin a short distance of the buildings at Fort Rae for the first time\r\nin several years.\r\n\r\n                         WEST OF THE MACKENZIE.\r\n\r\n“Mr. John Firth, of the Hudson’s Bay Company, for many years stationed\r\nat Fort McPherson and on Porcupine river, informed me that the herds of\r\ncaribou west of the Mackenzie have a semi-annual movement to and from\r\nthe sea-coast. In their journeys they head toward the prevailing winds,\r\nand consequently occasionally pass to the eastward of the mountains,\r\nthough usually to the westward. The southward movement commences in\r\nAugust, and extends only about four hundred miles. They start to return\r\nin March. Though the bulk of the animals then proceed to the coast, a\r\nfew remain throughout the summer in the elevated and semibarren country\r\nbetween the Peel and the Porcupine. The Indians from La Pierre House,\r\nwho arrived at Fort McPherson during my stay there early in July, 1904,\r\nhaving crossed the mountains on foot, had killed a few of these animals\r\non the way.\r\n\r\n                       THE BARREN GROUND CARIBOU.\r\n\r\n“During Franklin’s first northern journey, the Barren Ground species was\r\nfirst met with on the upper part of Yellowknife river, about the middle\r\nof August, 1820; toward the end of September it had become common about\r\nFort Enterprise; on October 10 an estimated number of two thousand were\r\nseen during a short walk in the vicinity; by October 26, they had\r\ndeparted southward, but about the middle of November, on account of\r\nwarmer weather, they returned to the neighbourhood. During the following\r\nsummer, while the party was exploring the Arctic coast to the eastward\r\nof Coppermine river, caribou were found to be rather common at the mouth\r\nof Hood river, and were noted also on Parry bay and at Point Turnagain.\r\nDuring Franklin’s second journey, reindeer were killed near Fort\r\nFranklin, Great Bear lake. J. C. Ross states that great numbers were\r\nseen about the Isthmus of Boothia.\r\n\r\n“During Richardson’s journey along the Arctic coast east of the\r\nMackenzie, in the summer of 1848, he observed the species near Liverpool\r\nbay in August, and on Darnley bay later in the same month, and saw many\r\nat Bloody fall, on the lower Coppermine, on September 5.\r\n\r\n“West of the Mackenzie they are still abundant along the barren coast\r\nand in the mountains south of it. They migrate southward in autumn, but\r\nhow far is not known. Rampart House was a ‘deer post,’ being situated in\r\na pass traversed semi-annually by the caribou.\r\n\r\n“The whalers reported that the caribou were abundant among the islands\r\nbetween the mouth of the Mackenzie and Cape Bathurst in July, 1894.”\r\n\r\n                        GAME AT FORT CONFIDENCE.\r\n\r\nEx-Judge Malcolm Macleod, in his evidence before the Senate committee in\r\n1888, referred to a very interesting letter his father had received from\r\nMr. Thomas Simpson, the Arctic explorer, dated from Fort Confidence at\r\nthe northeast end of Great Bear lake. Fort Confidence was, at the time\r\nthis evidence was given, the most northerly habitation on this continent\r\nthat was inhabited by white men. It was within the Arctic circle (67\r\ndegrees 53 minutes and 36 seconds). Simpson spoke of the food resources\r\nof Fort Confidence as being abundant. The distances between posts were\r\nso great that even Dease and Simpson’s, which was a Hudson bay\r\nexpedition thoroughly equipped, could carry food barely sufficient for\r\nuse on the way. They were there three winters (those of 1836-37, ’37-38\r\nand ’38-39), nearly three years, and never failed a single day to have\r\nan abundant supply of food. Franklin suffered more, because his party\r\nwas not so well equipped at times, but it is a striking fact that,\r\nnotwithstanding the severity of the climate, especially in 1838, when\r\nthe letter was written—an exceptionally severe season—they never ran\r\nshort of food. They had abundance of fish, deer (caribou), musk ox, and\r\nmeat of other kinds at all times.\r\n\r\nFort Rae, on the northern branch of Great Slave lake, according to Mr.\r\nR. G. McConnell, who visited it in 1888, is surrounded by a deer\r\ncountry, and is looked on rather as a provision post than as a fur post,\r\nalthough it also ranks high in the latter respect. In the winter,\r\nthousands of the “Barren Lands” caribou, which have been driven south by\r\nthe severity of the climate, are slaughtered in its vicinity, and their\r\nflesh is converted into dry meat for use in the district.\r\n\r\nMr. Keele says in his report:—“Caribou were observed only at one\r\nlocality on Gravel river, near the edge of the first timber, about\r\ntwenty miles from the divide.”\r\n\r\n                         IN COUNTLESS NUMBERS.\r\n\r\nMr. A. H. Harrison, writing of his first visit to Great Slave lake in\r\n1902 and 1903 (“In Search of a Polar Continent”), makes the following\r\nstatement:—“The first winter that I spent on this lake I went out after\r\ncaribou and when we got among them, after six days’ hard travelling,\r\nthey were in countless numbers. This is no exaggeration. They were on a\r\nlake ten miles in length and five in width, and it was packed so closely\r\nwith deer that you could not catch a glimpse of the ice-flooring\r\nanywhere. We started from Fort Resolution on that occasion with thirty\r\nsledges, but only five of these arrived. The mode of hunting employed\r\nwas curious. Clad in deerskin, the hairy side of which was outermost,\r\none Indian walked right through the deer to the other end of the lake,\r\nwithout any of them taking much notice of him. This surprised me very\r\nmuch, nor was the cause for surprise at an end. Two more Indians, clad\r\nin the same way, followed at a distance of about two miles behind the\r\nfirst, one on each side of the lake, and each of these was similarly\r\nfollowed by yet another, whilst I myself remained where I was at the\r\nlower end of the lake. When the foremost Indian had reached the other\r\nend, he began to shout, and the deer, not knowing which way to go,\r\nstarted running round and round the lake. I killed half a dozen myself,\r\nand my companions each brought home a load. Had I cared to do so, I\r\ncould have killed many more.\r\n\r\n“At the north end of Great Slave lake lies Christie bay and thirty miles\r\nnortheast of this bay is a second bay, of considerable size, enclosing\r\nan island, on which, upon another occasion, I had pitched my camp. I was\r\njust cooking my midday meal, when a herd of deer passed within a few\r\nyards of the camp fire, and I killed five of them in as many minutes. In\r\nthis locality I stayed for a whole month, with one Indian, and after\r\ncatering for ourselves and for our dogs, I made a cache of fifty deer,\r\nsome of which I gave to the mission, and some to Mr. Gaudet, in charge\r\nof the Hudson’s Bay Company’s post here. The end of November and the\r\nwhole of December is the best time of year for going from Fort\r\nResolution after caribou.”\r\n\r\nMr. Harrison also mentions that his party, while camping or travelling\r\nabout the country around the delta of the Mackenzie in 1905 and 1906,\r\noften shot caribou.\r\n\r\n                   OTHER BIG GAME—THE MOUNTAIN SHEEP.\r\n\r\nIn a previous chapter lengthy reference has been made to the wood\r\nbuffalo, the most northern port of whose range lies in the southern part\r\nof the country immediately under consideration. Besides the moose,\r\ncaribou, and buffalo, the game animals of the Mackenzie include the red\r\ndeer, bears of several kinds, the lynx, the hare, the wolverine, the\r\nmountain sheep, etc., etc. Mr. Keele, in his report of his\r\nreconnaissance across the Mackenzie mountains in 1907 and 1908, states\r\nthat mountain sheep are plentiful on parts of Gravel river, particularly\r\non the low mountains between the Sayunei and the Tigonankweine ranges.\r\nAmong the hundreds of sheep seen by the writer in this locality none but\r\nthose with pure white wool were observed. The sheep are highly prized\r\nfor their heads, and on account of their flesh, which is the best of all\r\nthe wild meat; consequently they are hunted to extermination in any of\r\nthe accessible localities.\r\n\r\nAs to the smaller fur-bearing animals, the beaver, mink, otter, marten,\r\nermine, fox, etc., they exist in great numbers and sustain the only\r\npresent industry in the country, the fur trade.\r\n\r\n                            FEATHERED GAME.\r\n\r\nAs to the feathered game there are grouse and ptarmigan, and in season\r\nducks of all kinds, geese, etc. In his evidence before the Senate\r\ncommittee of 1888, Bishop Clut stated that Mackenzie river, where it\r\nleaves Great Slave lake, and the mouths of Athabaska, Peace, Salt and\r\nGreat Slave Lake rivers, were places where the imperial birds\r\n(outardes), the grey goose, the white goose, large and small, and the\r\nswan prefer to stop to fatten themselves. They were there in such\r\nnumbers sometimes in the spring and the autumn that one could hardly\r\nsleep when camping near them. These fowl remained there nearly six weeks\r\neach spring and as long in the autumn. The ducks passed all summer\r\nthere. The outardes, the grey goose, white goose (large and small),\r\nswans, ducks of numerous species and varieties are of great value, and\r\nconstitute the greater part of the people’s food in the spring and the\r\nautumn. These fowl are very numerous. The number of them is\r\nincalculable.\r\n\r\n                    INEXHAUSTIBLE SUPPLIES OF FISH.\r\n\r\nThe wealth of the Mackenzie country in fresh water fish may be said to\r\nbe a tradition.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting sections to sportsmen, of that part of Mr.\r\nPreble’s report referring to the fish of the Mackenzie basin, is that\r\nunder the heading “Speckled Trout,” in which he says:—“Under this\r\ngeneral heading I include a few notes collected from various sources\r\nregarding the occurrence of speckled or brook trout, probably of several\r\nspecies, in a number of widely separated localities in the Mackenzie\r\nbasin. Mr. John Firth, of Fort McPherson, assured me that speckled trout\r\nare found in West Rat river, a tributary of the Porcupine west of Fort\r\nMcPherson. It is probable that these are either _Salmo mykiss_ or\r\n_Salvelinus malma_, both of which are known to occur in Alaskan streams.\r\nIn East Rat river, also, which is connected with the westward flowing\r\nstream (and therefore may contain trout of the same species), but which\r\nflows eastward into the Peel, he said that speckled trout are common.\r\nMr. Firth also informed me that a form of speckled trout is found in the\r\nstream which enters the sea a short distance west of the mouth of the\r\nMackenzie. Mr. MacFarlane states that speckled trout have been taken in\r\nlower Anderson river. As anadromous trout of the _Salvelinus alpinus_\r\ntype are known to occur in the Coppermine, these records may refer to\r\nthe same species. I also learned from several independent sources that\r\nspeckled trout occur in Tawattinaw and in one or two other tributaries\r\nof the Athabaska, but I was never able to procure specimens.”\r\n\r\n                          THE ARCTIC GRAYLING.\r\n\r\nBefore the Senate committee of 1888, Doctor G. M. Dawson stated that in\r\nall the waters tributary to the Mackenzie, the Arctic grayling, or\r\nBack’s grayling, which is an excellent fish, was to be found. It is a\r\nfish resembling the trout in appearance and size, but has a very large\r\nback fin. It is a very game fish very much like the trout, takes the fly\r\nand is excellent eating. That fish witness found in the headwaters of\r\nthe Mackenzie, as far up as the very source of Peace river, and also\r\nthat of Liard river. It also occurs in Nelson river to its headwaters.\r\nIt is a purely fresh water fish, and a two-pounder would be a fair sized\r\none.\r\n\r\nMr. Keele, speaking of his reconnaissance explorations in 1907 and 1908,\r\nsays that grayling, herring and a variety of brook trout were found in\r\nGravel river, there being an abundance of grayling, but herring and\r\ntrout were rarely taken.\r\n\r\nMr. E. A. Preble has the following to say in his report with reference\r\nto this fine fish:—\r\n\r\n“The Arctic grayling, usually called bluefish in the north, has a very\r\nextensive range. It occurs throughout the region from Peace river and\r\nAthabaska lake northward and northwestward to Arctic ocean. I can not\r\nfind that it has been detected in the Athabaska. As it prefers clear\r\nstreams it is somewhat local in distribution, occurring but seldom in\r\nthe main rivers, which are usually muddy, but being abundant in many of\r\nthe clear tributaries and the lakes which they drain. During my\r\nexplorations I met with the grayling in the lake country between Great\r\nSlave and Great Bear lake and at a number of points on the Mackenzie. It\r\nwas especially abundant in the rapid stream which I descended to\r\nMacTavish bay in August, 1903, and I caught many while fishing for trout\r\nwith a spoon hook. It was common also in Great Bear lake near Fort\r\nFranklin a little later, where many were being taken in the whitefish\r\nnets.\r\n\r\n“The grayling is said to be scarce in the Liard below the mouth of the\r\nNelson, but to be common above that point. It is also found in most of\r\nthe tributaries of the Mackenzie, several of which have local names\r\nreferring to its occurrence.\r\n\r\n“As an index to the distribution of this interesting fish I have\r\nselected the following references: Back recorded it from the mouth of\r\nHoarfrost river, Great Slave lake; from the head of Backs river; and\r\nfrom Lake Pelly on the same stream. Doctor G. M. Dawson reported its\r\ncapture in upper Peace river, and in the Finlayson, a tributary of the\r\nupper Liard. MacFarlane has recorded it from Anderson river.\r\n\r\n“I am not aware that the grayling has been recorded from any stream\r\ntributary to Hudson bay, except in one instance. Doctor Bell mentions\r\nthat it was taken in tributaries of the lower Churchill, and that a\r\nspecimen was identified by Professor Gill as _Thymallus signifer_. A\r\npossible explanation of the occurrence of this fish in the Churchill is\r\nsuggested by the fact that there is a direct water connection between\r\nChurchill river and Athabaska lake. The grayling occurs in Black or\r\nStone river, which flows from Wollaston lake into Athabaska lake. The\r\nwaters of another outlet of Wollaston lake, Cochrane river, flow by way\r\nof Reindeer lake into the Churchill, thus affording to a torrent-loving\r\nspecies like the Arctic grayling a ready means of communication.”\r\n\r\n                      GREAT SLAVE LAKE FISHERIES.\r\n\r\nThe marvellous productiveness of the fisheries of Great Slave lake and\r\nmany of the rivers in its vicinity have been time and time again\r\ncommented upon by travellers.\r\n\r\nIn the account of his journey in 1772, Samuel Hearne, writing (p. 249)\r\nof the fish in Great Slave lake (his Athapapuskow), states:—“The fish\r\nthat are common in this lake, as well as in most of the other lakes in\r\nthis country, are pike, trout, perch, marble, tittameg, and methy. The\r\ntwo last are names given by the natives to two species of fish which are\r\nfound only in this country. Besides these, we also caught another kind\r\nof fish, which is said by the northern Indians to be peculiar to this\r\nlake; at least none of the same kind have been met with in any other.\r\nThe body of this fish much resembles a pike in shape, but the scales,\r\nwhich are very large and stiff, are of a beautifully bright silver\r\ncolour; the mouth is large, and situated like that of a pike, but when\r\nopen it much resembles that of a sturgeon, and though not provided with\r\nany teeth, takes a bait as ravenously as a pike or a trout. The sizes we\r\ncaught were from two feet long to four feet. Their flesh, though\r\ndelicately white, is very soft and has so rank a taste, that many of the\r\nIndians, unless they are in absolute want, will not eat it. The trout in\r\nthis lake are of the largest size I ever saw; some that were caught by\r\nmy companions, could not, I think, be less than thirty-five or forty\r\npounds weight. Pike are also of an incredible size in this extensive\r\nwater. Here they are seldom molested, and have multitudes of smaller\r\nfish to prey upon. If I say that I have seen some of these fish that\r\nwere upwards of forty pounds weight, I am sure I do not exceed the\r\ntruth.”\r\n\r\n                          MULTITUDES OF FISH.\r\n\r\nRichardson in his “Arctic Searching Expedition” (Vol. 1, p. 160),\r\nspeaking of Demarais’s fishery on Great Slave lake, writes:—“During the\r\nwhole summer, in the eddies between the islands of this part of the\r\nlake, multitudes of fish may be taken with hooks, and by nets, such as\r\ntrout, white fish, pike, sucking carp, and inconnu. In spring and autumn\r\nwild-fowl may be procured in abundance at several places in the\r\nneighbourhood which are their accustomed passes, and the fishery on the\r\nnorth side of Big island seems to be inexhaustible in the winter. With\r\ngood fishermen, and a proper supply of nets, a large body of men may be\r\nwintered here in safety and plenty. In no other part of the Hudson’s Bay\r\nCompany’s territories, with which I am acquainted can so many people be\r\nmaintained, with so much certainty, on the resources of the country.”\r\n\r\n                      THE ORDINARY FISHING SEASON.\r\n\r\nMr. R. G. McConnell reports that during the ordinary fishing season on\r\nGreat Slave lake, which usually lasts from September 20 to October 10,\r\nthe fish leave the deeper parts of the lake and migrate in vast numbers\r\nto certain favored waters where almost any quantity desired can be\r\nobtained. The Big island fishery supplied Fort Simpson and Fort\r\nProvidence in 1887 with about forty thousand fish, besides affording\r\nconstant support to a number of Indians. At the mouth of the Beaver\r\nabout twenty thousand were taken, and the fisheries at the mouth of Hay\r\nriver, in the bay in front of Fort Rae, and near Fort Resolution,\r\nbesides other places, yielded corresponding quantities. Mr. McConnell\r\nestimated the total yield of the lake for the year 1887 at about half a\r\nmillion pounds. The most abundant and valuable of the fishes of the lake\r\nis the widely distributed whitefish (_Coregonus clupeiformis_). With the\r\nwhitefish are associated the lake trout (_Salvelinus namaycush_), which\r\noften attains a weight of over fifty pounds, the inconnu (_Stenodus\r\nMackenzii_), the pike (_Esox lucius_), and the sucker (_Catostomus\r\nlongirostris_), besides others of less importance. A stray salmon was\r\ncaptured about forty miles below the outlet of the lake, and was\r\ndescribed by Mr. Reid of the Hudson’s Bay Company as being identical\r\nwith the common Yukon salmon, probably _Oncorhynchus Chouicha_, but\r\nvisitors of this kind are very rare.\r\n\r\nMr. McConnell informed the Senate committee of 1907 that there are great\r\nquantities of whitefish in nearly all the lakes. Mr. McConnell wintered\r\nat Fort Providence, just below Great Slave lake, and in ten days there\r\nwere about one hundred and forty thousand fish caught. They come into\r\nthe shallow part of the lake about September 15. They are caught by the\r\nHudson’s Bay Company, the missions and some Indians, and are used to\r\nfeed the men and dogs. It is the staple food of the country, or was the\r\nyear witness was there. They catch the fish at all seasons, but late in\r\nthe fall is the particular time for catching them for the winter supply.\r\nThey get salmon trout there also. At the Fort he had had them weighing\r\nfifteen to twenty pounds, and they told stories about catching them\r\nforty pounds in weight. There was one king salmon caught at Fort\r\nProvidence—only one. They also get pike or jackfish. Mr. McConnell did\r\nnot know about pickerel.\r\n\r\nThe inconnu is a fine fish, and is caught all the way along the\r\nMackenzie and up Slave river as far as the rapids. It is a large fish\r\nweighing from ten to twenty pounds.\r\n\r\n                            A SPECIMEN HAUL.\r\n\r\nMr. A. H. Harrison says (“In Search of a Polar Continent.”):—\r\n\r\n“Most of the small streams which run into Slave river come from large\r\nlakes that abound with fish. To these lakes we often went up in a small\r\ncanoe, and set a net, which, as a rule, if left out all night, contained\r\na couple of dozen fish the next morning; or, to give the component\r\nweights of a specimen “haul”, we had on one occasion two pounds of\r\nwhitefish, twenty-five pounds of inconnu, ten pounds of trout, and\r\ntwenty pounds of pike. We had always, in fact, to throw back a great\r\nnumber keeping only two or three for immediate eating. In the spring of\r\n1903 I had taken an Indian and his family with me on to this river to\r\nshoot duck and geese, and before a fortnight was out we had killed\r\nsixty-three geese and a great quantity of duck. I had trouble, however,\r\nwith this Indian, who was but a poor spirited fellow, and he left me by\r\nmyself at the mouth of a small river that ran down from a lake about\r\nsixty miles from Fort Resolution. Here for a whole month I was encamped\r\nalone, and had no difficulty in keeping myself—fish, wild-fowl, and\r\nblack bear being plentiful. I had a net in the water, thereby securing,\r\nas I have already intimated, some two dozen fish a day, the bulk of\r\nwhich I threw back. In Slave river itself, which is very muddy, I have\r\nnever caught many fish, but the lakes off the river swarm with them.\r\n\r\n“Fort Resolution is a delightful place. I spent a winter there in\r\n1902-03, making many excursions into the surrounding country. There are\r\nthree trading posts there, also a Roman Catholic mission, where Bishop\r\nBreynart makes his headquarters, and a convent in which about forty\r\nnative children are educated. Everyone relies upon fish and reindeer for\r\nsubsistence. I heard a story of a trout weighing eighty-four pounds\r\nhaving been taken in Great Slave lake, but though I saw many trout that\r\nwere caught during my stay there, I never set eyes upon any weighing\r\nmore than forty-five pounds. While passing through on my recent journey\r\nI offered fifty dollars, or ten pounds, sterling, to anyone who should\r\nbring me a trout that scaled fifty pounds, but when I came back Mr.\r\nHarding of the Hudson’s Bay Company said that he had not in the meantime\r\nseen any which weighed over forty-three pounds. Even this, of course, is\r\na large weight for lake trout. The whitefish, however, rather than the\r\ntrout, is the chief food. It weighs about two pounds, and is caught in\r\ngreat quantities. The dogs never get anything to eat except fish, and\r\nthey thrive on the diet. Two pounds of fish apiece daily is barely\r\nenough to keep them alive, but two fish weighing two pounds each are an\r\nample ration for a dog.\r\n\r\n                        BISHOP CLUT’S TESTIMONY.\r\n\r\nDuring his examination before the Senate committee of 1888, Bishop Glut\r\nemphasized the fact that an important natural resource of the Mackenzie\r\nbasin lay in immense quantities of fish found in the great lakes, the\r\nAthabaska, Great Slave and Great Bear. East of those lakes there were\r\nmany other great lakes which were full of fine fish.\r\n\r\nThe bishop had not been at Great Bear lake, but from reports of Fathers\r\nPetitot, O.M.I., and Ducot, O.M.I., he knew that the lake was immense\r\nand abounding in fish. There was an abundance of small fish, which he\r\nbelieved to be herring.\r\n\r\nTo the eastward of Mackenzie river, separated from it by a chain of\r\nmountains, running in the same direction as the great river, a\r\nsuccession of beautiful and magnificent great lakes, full of fish, was\r\nfound. They had named them “Pius IX”, “Demazenod” and “Tache”. These\r\nwere the three largest lakes. The bishop had crossed them in winter from\r\nFort Good Hope to Fort Norman.\r\n\r\nLakes were innumerable in the basin of the Great Mackenzie, and nearly\r\nall of them abounded in fish of different kinds. The regions east,\r\nnortheast, and north, above all, abounded in lakes of all sizes, and\r\nwere very rich in fish. Lake Athabaska furnished a very great quantity\r\nof whitefish, of small and large salmon trout, of pike, of pickerel, of\r\ncarp, of large loches, etc. The whitefish weighed at least three pounds;\r\nthe small trout from four to ten; the large trout from ten to\r\nthirty-five; the pike from four to twenty pounds; the carp the same. In\r\nClear lake pike were caught weighing from twenty-five to thirty-five\r\npounds. Whitefish, pike, pickerel, carp and trout were caught in nets in\r\nwhich the meshes were four and a half inches in size.\r\n\r\nGreat Slave lake produced the same species of fish that Great Athabaska\r\nlake did, and also in much greater quantity. They find there also the\r\ninconnu, a species of salmon which came from Arctic ocean. It was\r\nundeniable that it comes from the sea. It was found all the way up the\r\nMackenzie as far north as the river at Fort Smith. There the rapids and\r\nthe cascades prevented it ascending higher. It was a beautiful and fine\r\nfish—the shape of the whitefish, but much larger. It weighed from eight\r\nto thirty pounds.\r\n\r\n               HERRING AND THE INCONNU IN THE MACKENZIE.\r\n\r\nW. F. Bredin, M.L.A., in his evidence before the Senate committee of\r\n1907, stated that herring from Arctic ocean ascend the Mackenzie to\r\nabout Fort Wrigley. They are good fish. He said he had been told that\r\nGreat Bear lake just teems with that same herring.\r\n\r\nIn his report, William Ogilvie, D.L.S., gives the following information\r\nabout the chief fishes of Mackenzie river:—“Fish are numerous in the\r\nMackenzie, the principal species being that known as the ‘Inconnu.’\r\nThose caught in the lower river are very good eating, much resembling\r\nsalmon in taste, being also firm and juicy. The flesh is a light pink in\r\ncolor, but as they ascend the river and become poor, this turns white\r\nand the flesh gets soft and unpalatable. They average ten or twelve\r\npounds in weight, but have often been caught weighing thirty or forty.\r\nThey ascend as far as the rapids, on Great Slave river, where they are\r\ntaken in the fall in great numbers for dog-feed, being then so thin that\r\nthey are considered unfit for human food, if anything else is\r\nobtainable. This fish is not fed to working dogs, unless scarcity of\r\nother fish compels it. There is a small fish known locally as ‘herring’\r\nsomewhat resembling the inconnu in appearance, and which does not grow\r\nlarger than a pound or two in weight. The staple fish of the district,\r\nand for that matter, of the whole northwest, is the whitefish. They\r\nabound in many parts of the river, but especially in all the lakes\r\ndischarging into it, and form the principal article of diet during the\r\ngreater part of the time, as very little food is brought into the\r\ncountry. This fish is caught in large numbers everywhere.”\r\n\r\n                        FISH IN GREAT BEAR LAKE.\r\n\r\nMr. Hanbury mentions that one August night his party’s nets in Great\r\nBear lake caught sixteen whitefish, “some of them very large, seven or\r\neight pounds; none of them under four pounds. This was the largest\r\naverage of whitefish of which I had heard. In Great Slave lake their\r\naverage weight is three pounds.”\r\n\r\nMr. E. A. Preble describes the lake trout so often referred to\r\n(_Cristivomer naymacush_) as a beautiful fish inhabiting nearly every\r\nbody of water in the north, but abounding in the larger sheets of water,\r\nincluding Great Bear lake, and as the water is there beautifully clear\r\nthe traveller frequently sees them pursuing their prey in the depths, or\r\nlying motionless near the bottom.\r\n\r\nA trout taken by Simpson’s party at Fort Confidence, Great Bear lake,\r\nmeasured four and one-half feet in length and twenty-seven inches in\r\ngirth, and weighed forty-seven pounds.\r\n\r\nRichardson states that Franklin’s party, during eighteen months’\r\nresidence at Fort Franklin in 1825-26, took three thousand five hundred\r\ntrout weighing from two to thirty pounds each.\r\n\r\n                          THE LOWER MACKENZIE.\r\n\r\nWriting of his visit to the small post at the mouth of Arctic Red river\r\non the lower Mackenzie in the autumn of 1905, Mr. Harrison (“In Search\r\nof a Polar Continent”) remarks:—“Before starting we loaded up nine\r\nsledges, at the mouth of Arctic Red river, with dried fish, which was\r\nnow to be obtained in abundance. On reaching this post, indeed, I had\r\ncalculated that there were about twenty thousand dried fish hanging up\r\nthere, which had all been caught in nets and smoked over the camp fires.\r\nThis industry of catching fish is busily and extensively carried on each\r\nyear upon Mackenzie river. The natives begin operations in August and\r\ncontinue as long as the river is open; few fish are taken after the ice\r\nhas set fast. The chief kinds of fish which are caught are the inconnu\r\n(or Mackenzie river salmon, though it would seem rather to be a sort of\r\nherring), the white fish and the trout. The inconnu, which turns the\r\nscale at anything between twenty and forty pounds, is excellent\r\nprovender alike for men and for dogs; when dried, it becomes, of course,\r\nmuch lighter by shrinkage, and can conveniently be carried on sledges.\r\nThe whitefish, as I have previously stated, average about two pounds a\r\npiece; the heaviest I saw here weighed eight pounds. The whitefish,\r\nmoreover, furnish a more toothsome repast than any other kind obtainable\r\nin these waters. There are numerous trout in the surrounding lakes, but\r\nI seldom procured any of them.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The “Conny” or “Inconnu.”]\r\n\r\nMr. Harrison mentions that in 1906 in the country between Point\r\nSeparation on the Mackenzie delta and Liverpool bay on the Arctic coast,\r\nat the mouth of a small river, his Esquimaux caught several huge pike,\r\none of which he weighed and found to scale forty-two pounds. They were\r\nexcellent eating, but they tore the nets to pieces. This stream, Mr.\r\nHarrison says, is fifty yards wide, and is thickly timbered on both\r\nbanks.\r\n\r\n                         THE WHALING INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\nIt is not proposed to discuss here the fisheries of Arctic ocean and of\r\nthe islands which lie therein, but having come down to the mouth of the\r\nMackenzie we might well devote a couple of paragraphs to a fishing\r\nindustry actively prosecuted in the immediate vicinity.\r\n\r\nIn his annual report dated Fort Macpherson February 16, 1910, Inspector\r\nG. L. Jennings makes the following reference to the whaling industry in\r\nnorthern waters: “In August, 1909, the steamer _Karluk_ arrived at\r\nHerschel island. She is an independent whaler, the stock of the venture\r\namounting to thirty-two thousand dollars, being owned by the captain,\r\nthe officers, and some merchants of San Francisco. The _Karluk_ cruised\r\nin the neighbourhood of Baillie island and Banks Land until the close of\r\nnavigation. She returned to Herschel island on September 23, having\r\nkilled eleven bowhead whales, eight of which I understand were taken in\r\nCanadian waters, north and east of Cape Parry. The value of this cargo\r\nof eleven head is, by an estimate at the present low price of bone,\r\neighty-five thousand dollars. The _Karluk_ is wintering at Herschel\r\nisland and will return to the eastward by first open water. As she will\r\nhave the field to herself for at least six weeks before any other ships\r\ncan arrive from the westward, the chances are that she will make another\r\nlarge catch, and will no doubt leave in the fall of this year for San\r\nFrancisco with a cargo of bone valued from one hundred and fifty\r\nthousand dollars upwards. The value of the trade of the _Karluk_ in\r\npelts will also be several thousand dollars. I think it is greatly to be\r\nregretted that no Canadian whaling ships or traders from our Pacific\r\ncoast come into this territory, instead of leaving everything to the\r\nAmericans. With a good class of trade goods, no cheap trashy stuff, and\r\nhaving no duty on these goods, selling or trading at a reasonable\r\nprofit, the whole trade of our Arctic coast could easily be secured. I\r\nthink it is but a matter of a very few years before American trading\r\nconcerns open stations at Herschel island, Kittigazuit and Baillie\r\nisland. If a Canadian firm was established first there would be no\r\nopposition.”\r\n\r\nIn a later report the same year, Inspector Jennings states that the\r\n_Karluk_ had killed nine whales during July, making twenty in all for\r\ntwo seasons with an approximate value of one hundred and thirty thousand\r\ndollars. He had also fur to the value of ten thousand dollars received\r\nin trade. On leaving Baillie island on August 14, the _Karluk_ cruised\r\nalong the south and west coast of Banks Land, north of Cape Kellett, to\r\nnorth latitude 72·31°. She left Herschel on August 26 and reached Nome,\r\nAlaska, on September 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ARCTIC PRAIRIE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE BARREN LANDS OR “ARCTIC PRAIRIE”.\r\n\r\n                  Topography, Soil, Climate and Flora.\r\n\r\n   Explorers Declare The Term “Barren Lands” a Misnomer.—Some Notes\r\n     About the Chief Rivers and Known Lakes—An Inland Waterway for\r\n     Steamers via Chesterfield Inlet a distance of Five Hundred and\r\n     Fifty Miles Into the Interior.—The Progression of the Seasons.\r\n     —The Country Similar to the Tundra of Siberia.—A Limited\r\n     Amount of Agriculture may be Possible in Places.—Natural\r\n     Prairies in the Valley of the Thelon.\r\n\r\nMost of the recent explorers and travellers who have visited the vast\r\nsub-arctic region extending from the present boundaries of the provinces\r\nof Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta to Arctic sea, and lying between\r\nHudson bay and the heights of land defining the eastern limits of the\r\nwatersheds of Mackenzie river and of the rivers flowing into the Arctic\r\nsea, north of Great Bear lake, have protested against the application to\r\nthe country of the term “Barren Lands.” For instance we find Mr. David\r\nT. Hanbury (See p. 21) in his well known volume “Sport and Travel in the\r\nNorthland of Canada” writing:—“I have always maintained that ‘Barren\r\nGround’ is a misnomer for the northland of Canada. No land can be called\r\n‘barren’ which bears wild flowers in profusion, numerous heaths,\r\nluxuriant grass, in places up to the knee, and a variety of moss and\r\nlichens. It is barren only in the sense that it is destitute of trees,\r\nhence the name ‘Dechin-u-le’ (no trees), which is the Indian name for\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nIn 1907, Mr. Ernest Thompson Seton, the author and artist, made a trip\r\ninto the barren lands via Athabaska river, Lake Athabaska, and Great\r\nSlave and Great Bear lakes. Describing his trip in a course of lectures,\r\nMr. Seton declared that the barrens were not in reality barren in any\r\nsense of the word. Nature had seized every available cleft in the rock,\r\nand had massed it with anemones, Athabaska roses, and beautiful flowers\r\nof all hues. Between the vast flower stretches the bare rock was covered\r\nwith rich mosses of varying colours. “In fact,” he said, “it seems that\r\nnature began at the barrens with a full palette, and when she got down\r\nto the tropical regions there was nothing left in her tubes but green.\r\nThe scenery surpasses that of the central west in the beauty of the\r\nhills and the manifold variety of wild flowers.”\r\n\r\n                    TERM “BARREN LANDS” A MISNOMER.\r\n\r\nMr. E. A. Preble gives us this sketch of the scenery of the Barren Lands\r\neastward of the Coppermine:—“Thousands of lakes dot its surface, and\r\nthey are often bordered by grassy plains and gentle slopes, on which,\r\nduring the short summer, the bright flowers of a profusion of shrubby\r\nand herbaceous plants lend their beauty to the landscape, and prove the\r\nappellation “Barren Grounds” to be a misnomer, though in many parts,\r\nfrom the nature of the soil, there is little plant life. Alders (_Aldus\r\nalnobetula_) occur in a more or less dwarfed condition in favourable\r\nplaces well into the treeless area, and several species of willows, some\r\nof which here attain a height of five or six feet, border some of the\r\nstreams as far north as Wollaston Land. These are the only trees which\r\noccur even in a dwarfed state on the barren grounds proper.”\r\n\r\nMr. J. B. Tyrrell, in one of his reports, describes the Barren Lands as\r\nconsisting “very largely of rolling plains, underlain by stony till and\r\ncovered with short grass or sedge.” He adds:—“Doubtless the ground is\r\npermanently frozen a great distance below the surface, and the surface\r\nin summer is almost constantly wet, like the plains of Assiniboia and\r\nSaskatchewan in early spring. Rounded rocky hills rise here and there\r\nthrough the clay, and on these, as well as often on the more stony parts\r\nof the till, the surface is dotted with a thick growth of lichens, such\r\nas _Alectoria ochroleuca_, _A. divergens_, and _Centraria Islandica_.\r\nMany flowers brighten these plains during the short summer months.”\r\n\r\nAs the country has been so long known as the Barren Lands, it would at\r\npresent scarcely be recognized by any other designation, although when\r\nthe exploitation of its mineral wealth once attracts population, it will\r\nsome day be known by some other and more suitable name—“Hearne,” for\r\ninstance, after the cognomen of the first white man who undertook to\r\nexplore its natural resources.\r\n\r\nAuthorities differ in their definitions of the limits of the Barren\r\nLands. Some consider the territory coming under that designation as\r\nextending much farther south in the vicinity of Hudson bay; others\r\ninclude in the Barren Lands most of the area immediately north of Great\r\nBear lake. Mr. Preble, the most recent scientific explorer to report\r\nofficially upon the country, under the heading “The Barren Grounds”,\r\nincludes the area lying to the northward and northwestward of Great Bear\r\nand Great Slave lakes. J. B. Tyrrell, M.A., B.Sc., F.G.S., in a paper\r\nread before the British Association at its Toronto meeting in 1897\r\nentitled “Natural Resources of the Barren Lands,” confined himself to a\r\nroughly triangular area bounded on the north by the Arctic ocean, on the\r\neast by the west coast of Hudson bay and Fox channel, and on the\r\nsouthwest by a line extending from the vicinity of Churchill on Hudson\r\nbay, northwestward, roughly at right angles to the magnetic meridian,\r\ncrossing Kazan river at Ennadai lake, Telzoa river at Boyd lake, passing\r\nsouth of Clinton-Colden and Aylmer lakes, across Point lake and down the\r\neast side of Coppermine river to within fifty miles of its mouth, and\r\nthence striking westward across Anderson river till it reaches the\r\nArctic coast near the mouth of Mackenzie river.\r\n\r\n                       MR. TYRRELL’S DEFINITION.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Tyrrell, this line follows very closely the line of the\r\nmean summer temperature of 50° Fahr. south of which some of the most\r\nhardy trees can grow and ripen their fruit, while north of it the summer\r\nis not sufficiently long or warm, to allow even the most hardy trees to\r\nbring their fruit to perfection.\r\n\r\nThis portion of the Barren Lands, according to Mr. Tyrrell, has a\r\ngreatest length from the southeast to northwest of twelve hundred miles;\r\na greatest breadth from southwest to northeast of seven hundred and\r\nfifty miles, and an area of four hundred thousand square miles, a region\r\ntwice as large as the province of Ontario, or more than three times as\r\nlarge as the whole United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that Mr. Tyrrell leaves out of consideration in this\r\npaper a couple of areas included in the term “Barren Lands” as used in\r\nthis chapter, namely the country south and southeast of the eastern arm\r\nof Great Slave lake, and a triangular piece of country in the angle\r\nbetween the same sheet of water and Yellowknife river. Mr. Tyrrell also\r\nconsiders the Arctic strip of country north of Great Bear lake to the\r\nmouth of the Mackenzie as forming part of the Barren Lands.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, Mr. Tyrrell makes the following comprehensive reference\r\nto the physical geography of this extensive region:—He says:—“In\r\ngeneral character the country is a vast undulating plain, underlain by a\r\nstony clay, and covered with a short grass or deciduous Arctic plants.\r\nIn certain sections no rising ground can be seen for miles around, and\r\nin other sections rocky hills rise through the general covering of clay.\r\nThe whole land reminds one forcibly of the great plains of Western\r\nCanada, the chief points of difference being caused by the differences\r\nin the underlying rocky-floor. The boulder-clay underlying the plains is\r\ndeposited on a floor of soft Cretaceous shales and sandstones, and even\r\nwhere the soft rocks crop out at the surface they rarely form\r\nconspicuous hills; the boulder-clay underlying the Barren Lands is\r\ndeposited largely on a floor of igneous, or hard, highly altered rocks,\r\nwhich, wherever they appear at the surface, form rocky knolls that stand\r\nup distinctly above the surrounding clay, while the boulder-clay itself,\r\nbeing formed out of material derived from the hard granitoid rocks, is\r\nmuch more stony than the clay of the more southern plains.\r\n\r\n                           NO HIGH ALTITUDES.\r\n\r\n“No part of the country rises to any great altitude above the sea, the\r\nhighest point being probably the ridge of rocky hills called Stony\r\nmountains, which run along the east side of Coppermine river, and are\r\nsaid to rise about fifteen hundred feet above the sea. Ennadai lake lies\r\neleven hundred feet above the sea, Dubawnt[24] lies five hundred feet,\r\nand the Yathkyed lake three hundred feet.\r\n\r\n“The country may conveniently be divided into two distinct portions,\r\nnamely, the Interior Upland and the Coastal Plain.\r\n\r\n“The Interior Upland includes all those parts of the country lying above\r\nthe highest ancient shore-line, either of Hudson bay or of Arctic ocean,\r\nand has a mean elevation of from nine hundred to one thousand feet above\r\nthe sea. Its surface is composed largely of sandy boulder-clay, and\r\nrounded boulders or broken fragments of the underlying rock. Low ridges\r\nand rugged, irregular hills are common over the surface, while eskers,\r\nor long straight ridges of sand or gravel, extend in uninterrupted\r\ncourses over hills and valleys alike. Here and there some ancient\r\nbeaches mark the positions of small lakes which have long since\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n                           THE COASTAL PLAIN.\r\n\r\n“The Coastal Plain lies between the highest ancient post-glacial\r\nseabeach and the present seashore, sloping gradually from a height of\r\nfive hundred to six hundred feet down to the sea-level. Much of this\r\nplain has a stony surface, like that of the Interior Upland, but it is\r\ndiversified with sandy plains, and on all the steeper slopes gravel\r\nterraces or coast cliffs mark the lines of the old seashore. Many of the\r\nterraces fill narrow gaps between adjoining hills, and the lower ones\r\nare often strewn with shells such as are found in Hudson bay at the\r\npresent time. The waves have reduced the surface irregularities of this\r\nportion of the country to some extent, but the more rocky districts,\r\nsuch as those in the vicinity of Chesterfield inlet are still, except\r\nfor the presence of the little terraces, as rough and rugged as before\r\nthey were covered by the sea, and the highest parts are probably barer,\r\nfor any loose material that had been left on them by the ice-sheet of\r\nthe glacial period has been washed by the waves into the depressions.\r\nThe breadth of the plain in the vicinity of Churchill is about fifty\r\nmiles. Farther north it becomes broader, until, in the latitude of\r\nYathkyed lake, it has a breadth of one hundred and twenty-five miles,\r\nand at the north end of Dubawnt lake extends westward for three hundred\r\nmiles. North of Dubawnt river its extent is not yet known, but many of\r\nthe old sand plains and terraces reported from the banks of Backs river\r\nprobably mark old shore-lines on this Coastal Plain, there sloping\r\nnorthward toward Arctic ocean.\r\n\r\n“In a few places the coast-line is fairly high but as a rule it is low,\r\nand slopes gently down into a shallow sea. The whole country has a\r\nfairly general slope northeastward, and the three principal streams\r\nwhich drain it have a more or less parallel course in that direction,\r\nwhile other smaller streams flow more directly towards the coast,\r\nnorthward to Arctic ocean and eastward to Hudson bay.\r\n\r\n                      THE THREE PRINCIPAL RIVERS.\r\n\r\n“These three streams are Thlew-e-cho, Great Fish or Backs river, Telzoa\r\nor Dubawnt river and Kazan river.\r\n\r\n“Backs river rises in Sussex lake about fifty miles within the edge of\r\nthe Barren Lands, in a basin surrounded by sandy hills, at an elevation\r\nof about five hundred and fifty feet above the sea, and after a course\r\nof six hundred miles empties itself into Arctic ocean a short distance\r\nsouth of the magnetic pole. This stream will always possess a melancholy\r\ninterest for every man or woman of British stock, for at its mouth the\r\ncrews of the Erebus and Terror, the two ships taken out by Sir John\r\nFranklin on his last ill-fated expedition, dropped in their tracks and\r\ndied as they attempted to reach a place of safety and plenty.\r\n\r\n“Telzoa or Dubawnt river rises in Daly lake a short distance south of\r\nthe Barren Lands, and flows northeastward, roughly parallel to Backs\r\nriver, until it strikes the wide valley which extends inland from\r\nChesterfield inlet, where it turns abruptly eastward and flows into the\r\nwest side of Hudson bay, its total length, including Chesterfield inlet,\r\nbeing eight hundred and seventy-five miles.\r\n\r\n“Kazan river rises in Kasba lake, fifty miles east of Daly lake, and\r\nflows approximately parallel to Telzoa river for about four hundred and\r\nninety miles to enter the south side of Baker lake though the exact\r\nposition of its mouth has not yet been determined. Of the smaller\r\nstreams the Anderson, Ferguson and Coppermine are the only three which\r\nhave been explored.”\r\n\r\n                             DUBAWNT LAKE.\r\n\r\nIn his official report of his trip of exploration in 1893, Mr. Tyrrell\r\ngave some particulars about Dubawnt lake, situated a little south of the\r\nmiddle of the Barren Lands. He writes:—“Dubawnt lake is a body of clear\r\ncold water of unknown extent, the southern and eastern shores indicated\r\nby dotted lines on the map, having been laid down from rude sketches\r\nmade by the Eskimo. Its western and northern shores were surveyed for\r\none hundred and seventeen miles, but from the summits of the highest\r\nhills the opposite shores were nowhere distinctly seen. Its approximate\r\naltitude above the sea level is five hundred feet. By the Chipewyan\r\nIndians it is called Tobatna or Water-shore lake, possibly from the fact\r\nthat the main portion of the lake is always covered with ice, and that\r\nin summer there is a lane of water between this ice and the shore. Its\r\nEskimo name is Tulemalugua. Judging from subsequent Eskimo reports, it\r\nhas two principal affluents. One of them flows into its southern side,\r\nand has scattered groves of white spruce on its banks. The other is\r\nDubawnt or Telzoa river which we had descended.\r\n\r\nBefore the Senate committee of 1907, Mr. Tyrrell explained that the\r\noutline of the lake as he sketched it still appears on the maps. He\r\nadded that the most recent government maps of the Barren Lands do not\r\npretend to be complete. They merely show the lakes that are known. There\r\nare thousands of others that we know nothing of, because nobody has been\r\nthrough there. Some of the larger ones are sketched in. Mr. Tyrrell\r\nsketched in many, from the reports of the Esquimaux, and they still\r\nappear as he so sketched them on the map. The whole country is studded\r\nwith lakes.\r\n\r\n                  WATER ROUTES VIA CHESTERFIELD INLET.\r\n\r\nFrom the reports of Messrs. Tyrrell and Hanbury and Inspector Pelletier,\r\nwe have obtained a pretty good idea of the outstanding features of the\r\ngreat system of inland waterways which find their outlet at tidal water\r\nat Chesterfield inlet.\r\n\r\nIn his report, speaking of Thelon river, which he discovered during his\r\ntrip in 1890, Mr. J. W. Tyrrell describes it as “one of the finest in\r\nCanada, navigable for river steamers and other boats of light draught\r\nall the way from Hudson bay to the forks of the Hanbury, a distance of\r\nfive hundred and fifty miles, excepting perhaps at two rapids on the\r\nriver above Baker lake, where some improvements to the channel may be\r\nmade.”\r\n\r\nHe continues:—“Just what length of time this route may be open for\r\nnavigation I am unable to say precisely, but would judge that the river\r\nportion must be open for at least five months, and the inlet and larger\r\nlakes about a month less, that is during the months of July, August,\r\nSeptember and October.”\r\n\r\nMr. C. C. Fairchild, who was attached to Mr. Tyrrell’s expedition and\r\nsurveyed the waters between Baker lake and Chesterfield inlet, writes in\r\nhis report:—“I am unable, owing to the short time at my disposal, to\r\nmake anything but a cursory examination of the general depths of the\r\nwater traversed, but I took soundings enough to satisfy myself that\r\nvessels\r\n\r\n                       DRAWING TEN FEET OF WATER\r\n\r\nwould have no difficulty in travelling from Hudson bay to the west end\r\nof Baker lake. Here boat navigation must end as far as the river between\r\nSchultz and Baker lakes is concerned, owing to rapids at either end of\r\nthe river that would in low water not permit of the passage of any craft\r\nlarger than a York boat.”\r\n\r\n“Chesterfield inlet in the main channel exceeded five fathoms in depth\r\nat all points tried, and soundings were only taken when I could see\r\nbottom, which was plainly visible at thirty feet and even more.”\r\n\r\nInspector Pelletier of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police, who went down\r\nthat river on his way from Great Slave lake in 1908, describes the lower\r\nreach of Thelon river just above Beverly lake as flowing through “low\r\nlying country with willows and grass. A high ridge of bare hills is seen\r\nin the distant north, running east and west. The river follows along the\r\nrange, winding through what I would call foothills, until it opens on\r\nBeverly lake. The country there is low lying.”\r\n\r\nBeverly lake to Hudson bay is a stretch of barrens. No wood grows on\r\nthat stretch but a few small willows in some very scattered spots and\r\nfar between. Beverly lake is surrounded by comparatively low lying sandy\r\ncountry. At the lower end the land is higher. Just entering into\r\nAberdeen lake the shores are rocky and immediately give place to low\r\nsandy soil. This extends for about thirty miles, when the country again\r\ntakes a rocky appearance and the ridges get higher and higher to the\r\nlower end where hills of from four hundred to five hundred feet in\r\nheight are seen, with solid rock formation. The north shore of Schultz\r\nlake is of high rocky ridges, in places four hundred feet high. When\r\ngetting to the lower end it alters to sand and gravel and becomes low\r\nlying. At the outlet of Schultz river it again becomes rocky. Below the\r\nlast rapid, near Baker lake, the country immediately becomes low lying\r\nand sandy and gravelly. The north shore of Baker lake is high and rocky;\r\nin places the bare rocky ridges advance and run into the lake, forming\r\nrough, bare points. The lower end of Baker lake is high, the ridges\r\nbeing about four hundred feet. Baker river flows between high banks of\r\nsolid rock. The formation of the country along Chesterfield inlet is\r\nmostly rocky, and is quite low lying, with here and there a prominent\r\nrocky point, but none above two hundred feet, except at the lower end,\r\nnear Deer island, where there is a collection of fairly high ridges.\r\n\r\n                      UPPER REACHES OF THE THELON.\r\n\r\nAs to the higher reaches of the Thelon, Mr. J. W. Tyrrell says in his\r\nreport:—“About two miles below the junction of Hanbury river, where we\r\nmade camp, some measurements of the Thelon were made, from which the\r\nvolume of the flow at the time was found to be over fifty thousand cubic\r\nfeet per second. The width of the stream measured one thousand two\r\nhundred and twenty-seven feet, depth of channel five feet, and velocity\r\nthree and a third miles an hour. These measurements being taken near the\r\nforks, show a less depth but greater width than exists at most parts.\r\n\r\n“Eight miles farther down the stream soundings were taken, showing a\r\ndepth of fourteen feet in mid-channel. At this point well grown spruce\r\ntrees were plentiful on both banks.\r\n\r\n“About thirty or thirty-two miles below the forks, two slight rapids\r\noccur where ridges of rock project into the stream, but they are so\r\nslight as not to seriously interfere with the navigation of the river\r\neither by canoes or large river boats.”\r\n\r\n                         ARTILLERY LAKE REGION.\r\n\r\nIn the report of his 1908 patrol, Inspector Pelletier thus describes\r\nArtillery lake,[25] northeast of Great Slave lake, and the portages\r\nthereabout:—“The south end of Artillery lake is rocky, the ridges are\r\nof solid rock, and hills do not rise above three hundred to four hundred\r\nfeet above the lake. Farther up the general character of the country\r\nchanges into rolling plains of sand, with more or less vegetation. In\r\nplaces bare sand ridges are seen of fine yellow colour. This again\r\nchanges at the upper end of the lake. There the formation is more\r\nbroken, solid rock ridges are few, but large boulders are numerous, and\r\nsand gets coarser, I might say gravelly, a mixture of clay and gravel,\r\nwith boulders more or less numerous. All the country is comparatively\r\nflat; there are no high hills anywhere more than two hundred to three\r\nhundred feet above water. At the northern end of Artillery lake are some\r\nsand ridges, also at the northern end of Kasba lake. At the portages the\r\nground is clay, with gravel and boulders, and in places, if one walks\r\nover the same spot a while to and fro, he will find that the ground will\r\nmove under his feet and become dangerous. In poking a stick through the\r\ncrust, water, air and mud immediately rush out. The whole country is\r\ncovered with these places; they are usually bare of vegetation, and\r\nlevel and free from stones, affording good camping ground, but one has\r\nto be careful not to bustle too much or he will find himself sinking\r\ninto a mud hole.”\r\n\r\nMr. Pelletier, in his report, speaking of his route from Artillery lake\r\nto Hanbury river, says:—“The stretch from Height of Land to below Lac\r\ndu Bois is not considered as a stream. It is only a succession of lakes\r\nseparated by short, shallow and turbulent streams of no size. Hanbury\r\nriver proper begins from below Lac du Bois, where it takes the\r\nappearance of a river. Above it can only be called the headwaters of\r\nHanbury river. The general conformation of the country is low, and only\r\nridges of gravel, or stones, not exceeding eighty feet in height, are\r\nseen. There are no cutbanks of any account. The slopes are gradual in\r\nmost cases.\r\n\r\nA few notes, as to the progression of the seasons in various parts of\r\nthe Barren Lands, taken from the journals and reports of a number of\r\nexplorers, will prove interesting.\r\n\r\n                       A SMART THAW EARLY IN MAY.\r\n\r\nBack records “a smart thaw” at Fort Reliance at the extreme eastern end\r\nof Great Slave lake, on May 6, 1834, and mentions that patches of green\r\nwere daily becoming visible. He farther on states:—“On May 13, a single\r\ngoose, the harbinger of summer, flew past the house, and during the day\r\nit was followed by five more, all of which took a northerly direction.\r\nThis was six days later than they had been seen in 1836 at Fort\r\nFranklin, though a higher northern latitude. A fly and a flock of small\r\nbirds appeared in the evening, and during the three succeeding days we\r\nhad gulls, orioles, grosbeaks, yellow legs, robins and butterflies.\r\n\r\n“On May 18, the catkins of the willows were half an inch long, and the\r\nsnow was fast disappearing from the ground.\r\n\r\n                     SULTRY TOWARDS THE END OF MAY.\r\n\r\n“Towards the end of the month (May) the weather became sultry, the\r\ntemperature in the sun being 106°—an extraordinary contrast to that of\r\nJanuary 17, when it was 70° below zero. The snow was all gone, except\r\nthat which had been drifted to a great depth in the narrow valleys, and\r\nunder steep precipices, and the Al-hel-dessy, to the westward, had burst\r\nits icy fetters, and opened a clear channel to the portage opposite the\r\nhouse; loons, gulls, and ducks took possession of the water, and seemed\r\nto contend which should make the most noise; some small birds also, very\r\nprettily marked, hovered about a short time, and then both they and the\r\nducks suddenly deserted us.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hanbury, writing specially of the region northeast of Chesterfield\r\ninlet, states:—“There is never much snow on the ‘Barren Grounds’, and a\r\nfew warm days suffice to lay the country bare. If spring overtook us far\r\ninland on rough ground, we should have an almost impossible march over\r\nbare ground to the Arctic coast. I therefore decided to begin that long\r\njourney not later than February.”\r\n\r\n                     SPRING AT CHESTERFIELD INLET.\r\n\r\nMr. Warburton Pike, writing of May 1, 1887, at a whaler’s camp on Hudson\r\nbay in the vicinity of Chesterfield inlet, states:—“Water was standing\r\nin pools over the ice in the bay; the snow had disappeared except in the\r\ndrifts; a light rain was falling, and the first goose was killed from\r\nthe door of the master’s house; small bands of wild-fowl were passing\r\nfrequently, and cranes were calling in the swamps to the southward;\r\ndaylight lingered in the sky all night, but there was always a sharp\r\nfrost while the sun was down.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hanbury, after crossing from Chesterfield inlet to the Arctic coast,\r\nwrites:—“June is the one perfect month in the northland. The\r\ntemperature is just right; there is not a fly or mosquito to trouble\r\none. The land is clear of snow, with the exception of a few deep drifts\r\nand banks, and the walking is good, for the land dries with wonderful\r\nrapidity. The ice is still good to travel over. Plenty of salmon are now\r\nrunning.”\r\n\r\nMr. Warburton Pike, on his canoe and overland trip in 1890, when north\r\nof the east end of Great Slave lake on June 16, wrote:—“A few warm days\r\nmade a great difference in the appearance of the country. Leaves began\r\nto sprout on the little willows, and the grass showed green on the\r\nhillsides; sober hued flowers, growing close to the ground, came out in\r\nbloom, and a few butterflies flapped in the hot sunshine, while we were\r\nstill walking on eight feet of solid ice. Mosquitoes appeared in\r\nmyriads; in the daytime there was usually a breeze to blow them away,\r\nand the nights were too cold for them, but in the calm mornings and\r\nevenings they made the most of their chance to annoy us.”\r\n\r\nOn June 25, Mr. Pike’s party planted their lodges on a high ridge\r\noverlooking Lake Mackay.\r\n\r\n                      ICE ON AYLMER LAKE JUNE 25.\r\n\r\nAt that same date the ice on Aylmer lake was still solid.\r\n\r\nIn 1821, when Franklin’s party started to descend the Coppermine on July\r\n1, the lakes on its upper course were still covered with ice. Apparently\r\nthe river had opened only a short time before. In 1849, Doctor Rae noted\r\nthe breaking up of the same river near its mouth on June 28. At this\r\ntime the leaves of the dwarf birches were out, and the leaf buds of the\r\nwillows had begun to develop. The lower part of the river remained\r\nblocked with ice until July 13.\r\n\r\nMr. Pike relates that about July 10 the weather in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe headwaters of Backs river “was variable in the extreme; two or three\r\nhot days would be followed by a snowstorm and once we were visited by a\r\nhurricane that did much damage to lodge-poles, and caused us to shift\r\ncamp hurriedly to the lee-side of a steep cliff hanging over the river.\r\nJuly 10 was exceptionally hot in the morning, with the mosquitoes at\r\ntheir worst; in the middle of the day there was a thunderstorm, and at\r\nfive o’clock the ground was covered with snow. The ice now began to show\r\nsigns of rotting, and the channel of open water round the weather edge\r\nof the lake grew rapidly broader.”\r\n\r\n                      SUNSET AT HALF PAST ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nOn July 19, according to Franklin, the sun set at the mouth of\r\nCoppermine river at half past eleven.\r\n\r\nFrom the official report of Inspector Pelletier we find that at\r\nArtillery lake on July 23 “the atmosphere was quite smoky and warm.” On\r\nthe morning of August 12 on Thelon river the ground was white with\r\nfrost, and the ice on a kettle of water was a quarter of an inch in\r\nthickness. The sun got up warm, and the weather during the day was\r\nperfect. August 13 (Beverly lake) was “a warm still day”. August 31\r\n(Chesterfield inlet) was “a nice still day, very warm.”\r\n\r\nWhile on their way from York to Lake Athabaska, and descending Cree\r\nriver, Sir George Simpson’s party, in 1823, picked “a good many ripe\r\nraspberries, currants and gooseberries on the portages” on July 30.\r\n\r\nMr. Tyrrell reports snow banks on the hillsides and great piles of\r\nrafted ice on the shore at Markham lake on Dubawnt river, south of\r\nDubawnt lake, on August 3, 1893.\r\n\r\nAs to the close of the Barren Lands summer, Back mentions that while\r\nascending the river which has since been given his name, on September 4,\r\n1834, “a hard gale from the northwest indicated the commencement of the\r\nfall weather, and, while we were travelling, many hundreds of geese flew\r\nhigh past us to the south.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hanbury mentions that one year during his travels two inches of snow\r\nfell during the night of September 18 and ice formed on the smaller\r\nlakes north of Baker lake. He remarks:—“On my journey in 1899 we\r\ntravelled on the ice with dogs the last days of June, and were beset by\r\nice on Schultz lake on July 31. Now in the middle of September we had\r\nice again, and it looked as if it had come to stay. We had not gone far\r\nwhen we were obliged, by the state of the weather, to put ashore and\r\ncamp. The rest of the day was spent in repairing our tent, which had\r\nsuffered considerably during the recent storm.”\r\n\r\nWarburton Pike states (“The Barren Ground of Northern Canada”) that the\r\nice on Great Slave lake is usually not safe for travel till the middle\r\nof December.\r\n\r\n                  ULTIMATE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nIn his paper read before the British Association at Toronto, Mr. J. B.\r\nTyrrell, referring to the temperature of the Barren Lands and its\r\nbearing upon the question of the ultimate development of the country,\r\nhad this to say:—\r\n\r\n“In this connection it may be stated that while the mean summer\r\ntemperature (which is below 50¼° on the Barren Lands) determines the\r\nlimit of the forest and the possibility of the growth of trees, the mean\r\nwinter temperature would probably determine the habitability of the\r\ncountry by human beings.\r\n\r\n“Now Churchill is the coldest inhabited place on this continent, with a\r\nmean winter temperature of -20.5° Fahr., and it is not likely that any\r\npart of the Barren Lands has a mean winter temperature of -30° Fahr.,\r\nwhile Yakutsk, a town of about five thousand inhabitants in Siberia, has\r\na mean winter temperature of -40.4° Fahr., and many other places in\r\nNorthern Asia have a still lower mean, one place having a mean winter\r\ntemperature of -50.2° Fahr. Most of these places have, however, a higher\r\nsummer temperature than is found in the Canadian Barren Lands, and are\r\ntherefore within the limit of woods.\r\n\r\n“It can thus be seen that Europeans and Asiatics live and thrive in a\r\nmuch more rigorous climate than is found even in the most inhospitable\r\nparts of northern Canada, and that therefore the climate does not offer\r\nany insuperable objection to settlement in that country.”\r\n\r\n               PRESENT INHABITANTS TWO THOUSAND ESKIMOS.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. J. B. Tyrrell (paper before the British Association):\r\n“The permanent inhabitants of the Barren Lands are about two thousand\r\nEskimos, who live either along the coast or on the banks of Kazan and\r\nDubawnt rivers. They subsist entirely by hunting and fishing, and the\r\nanimals on which they live are chiefly the Barren Land caribou and\r\nseveral species of seals. Besides these, about five hundred Chipewyan\r\nIndians usually penetrate a short distance into the Barren Lands from\r\nthe south during the summer in their annual deer-hunt, but they retire\r\nsouthward into the forest to spend the winter.”\r\n\r\n                      LIKE THE TUNDRA OF SIBERIA.\r\n\r\nDoctor (later Sir John) Richardson was one of the first explorers to\r\ndraw attention to the resemblance of the Barren Lands to the tundra of\r\nSiberia. In one place the learned scientist writes:—“The general\r\ncharacter of the tundra of the east of Siberia is like that of the\r\nAmerican barren grounds.”\r\n\r\nAgain he writes:—“In character the Siberian tundra is very similar to\r\nthe American ones. Thus Wrangell says,—‘When one coming from the naked,\r\nfrozen moss-tundra reaches the valleys of the Aninuik, which are\r\nsheltered by mountains from the prevailing cold winds, and where\r\nbirches, poplars, willows, and low creeping junipers (_Juniperus\r\nprostratus_) grow, he thinks himself transported to Italy.’”\r\n\r\nAll who have visited the Barren Grounds agree that the prospect of\r\nagriculture ever being successfully followed there on a large scale is\r\nvery slight, unless it is proved possible to develop the breeding of the\r\nLapland reindeer and make of it a profitable meat raising industry, or\r\nis found practicable to domesticate the native reindeer or caribou. Some\r\nof the scientific explorers, however, think there is a prospect of a\r\ncertain amount of barley agricultural produce, even grain of hardy\r\nvarieties being raised in one part—the valley of the Thelon.\r\n\r\n                     LIMITED AGRICULTURE POSSIBLE.\r\n\r\nMr. J. W. Tyrrell says in his report:—“The Thelon valley, though\r\naffording good grazing ground for musk-oxen and caribou, can scarcely be\r\nlooked upon as a desirable agricultural district, although I judge from\r\nthe growth and great variety of plants observed there, that some of our\r\ncereals and most of our hardy vegetables could be grown in the Thelon\r\nvalley.”\r\n\r\nMr. J. B. Tyrrell, brother of Mr. J. W. Tyrrell, in his evidence before\r\nthe Senate committee of 1907, stated that to the west of Hudson bay and\r\nnorth of the line of the forest which runs from Churchill northwestward\r\nthrough Ennadai lake, and a short distance south of Dubawnt lake, there\r\nis practically no agricultural land. Mr. Tyrrell would not consider that\r\nany of the land north of the limit of forest growth was of any value for\r\nagriculture. The tree line starts practically at Churchill and runs\r\nnorthwesterly. South of that there are trees, and north there are none.\r\nThe country north of the tree line is partly rock, but the greater part\r\nbroken rock and boulders, a rough stony country without any great\r\nelevation, and very little vegetation of any kind, except a great many\r\nArctic plants and sedges. Mr. Tyrrell believes the country is\r\npermanently frozen. It did not appear to him that there would be any\r\npossibility whatever of growing anything on it. That, in Mr. Tyrrell’s\r\nopinion, eliminates from an agricultural standpoint that portion\r\nnortheast of that line.\r\n\r\nTo the west of Hudson bay and south of the line of the treeless land\r\nwhich runs from Churchill northwestward through Ennadai lake, and a\r\nshort distance south of Dubawnt lake, there is a belt from one to two\r\nhundred miles in width of country that is sparsely wooded. It is not a\r\nforest country, but it is wooded along the streams, and in the more\r\nprotected places, but there is comparatively little wood of any value\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nIn that country there are, Mr. Tyrrell said, some low lying areas along\r\nthe streams and in odd places that would support a northern vegetation,\r\nbut it is not eminently suited for agriculture. The ordinary plants that\r\nare grown in many northern countries could doubtless be cultivated in\r\nmany places. There is very little humus, very little decomposed soil\r\nthere, except just in the valleys.\r\n\r\nInspector Pelletier, speaking in the report of his 1908 patrol of his\r\nroute from Artillery lake to Hanbury river, says:—“There are large\r\nstretches of arid country covered with boulders. Nevertheless all over\r\nis good feeding ground for deer.”\r\n\r\nThe country surrounding Hanbury river, Inspector Pelletier states,\r\nalternates from rocky ridges to sandy stretches and rocks broken up,\r\nwith country scattered with boulders. Moss and grass grow very poorly\r\ndown to Dickson canyon. From there on vegetation improves gradually\r\nuntil when, below the last fall, it becomes most luxuriant. The contrast\r\nis very noticeable.\r\n\r\n                    GOOD PASTURAGE ALONG THE THELON.\r\n\r\nAugust 9, while descending Thelon river, Inspector Pelletier’s party\r\ncamped for the night on a big grassy flat with a clump of trees at the\r\nback of it on a little mound. The inspector says in his report:—“I got\r\nto the top of the mound, and with my glasses I could see an immense\r\ntract of prairie country growing good grass with a few little low trees\r\nin the far distance. This tract of land, if situated in a more\r\naccessible spot, would certainly make the very best ranching country,\r\nand there are many more stretches like this on Thelon river.” The day\r\nprevious they had passed places where the banks of the river had washed\r\naway “showing very good and fertile soil.” Towards evening of August 10,\r\nthe country, which had got quite barren about noon-time, resumed again a\r\ngreen and fertile appearance and became well-wooded.” The following day\r\nanother section “barren in places” was passed, while later again quoting\r\nthe inspector’s report:—“the country assumed a better appearance, and\r\ntimber became larger and thicker, until it became a continuous forest\r\nalike on both banks, and as thick as on any river in the timbered belt.\r\nThis kept on for about ten miles, and we camped near a bluff about\r\neighty feet high, at the edge of the timber. The country then alters to\r\nlow lying ground, and timber again grew, but very stunted, and only in\r\nbunches, which gradually became more scattered, and after fifteen miles\r\ndisappeared totally to give place to long willows along the banks with\r\nlarge grassy flats farther in.”\r\n\r\n                   HARDY VEGETABLES MIGHT GROW THERE.\r\n\r\nIn his summary of observations on this section of his trip Inspector\r\nPelletier states in his report:—“There are large stretches of prairie\r\ncountry (along the Thelon) growing grass profusely. The soil seems to be\r\nmost fertile. I am told the river opens in May. If such is the case I\r\nwould judge that some of the hardy vegetables would grow there. The days\r\nare very long in summer.” Accounting for the absence of native\r\nsettlements from this valley, Inspector Pelletier says the Eskimos do\r\nnot like timber on account of the flies in the summer and soft snow in\r\nthe winter. They like the open barren coast, where the wind has full\r\nsweep, where the snow packs hard in winter and where game is permanent.\r\nThe Indians, on the other hand do not inhabit this tract because it is\r\nfar from trading posts, and because there is no birch for them to make\r\ntheir canoes.\r\n\r\nMr. J. W. Tyrrell, in his book “Through the Sub-Arctics of Canada,” says\r\n“Agricultural development is not to be expected anywhere in the northern\r\nparts of the district, but throughout the more southerly wooded portions\r\nthere are great possibilities in this direction.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Midnight Sun.]\r\n\r\n                           THE NATURAL FLORA.\r\n\r\nAs to the natural flora of the country, Mr. J. B. Tyrrell, in his\r\nexpedition of 1893 across the Barren Lands, collected one hundred and\r\ntwenty-four species of plants exclusively of algae and fungi. Reference\r\nhas already been made to some observations made by explorers as to the\r\nflowers and other natural vegetable growths.\r\n\r\nInspector Pelletier, Royal Northwest Mounted Police, reports that\r\nbetween Beverly lake and Hudson bay “grass grows in favoured spots, but\r\nthe balance of the country is bare.”\r\n\r\nDescribing the country at Bloody fall on the Coppermine, Franklin writes\r\nin his narrative:—“The ground is well clothed with grass and nourishes\r\nmost of the shrubs and berry-bearing plants that we have seen north of\r\nFort Enterprise, and the country altogether has a richer appearance than\r\nthe barren lands of the Copper Indians.”\r\n\r\nMr. A. P. Low, of the Geological Survey, passed a winter in the far\r\nnorth near Cape Fullerton in the “Neptune”. He expressed the opinion\r\nbefore the Senate committee of 1907 that the whole northern region about\r\nChesterfield inlet and Fullerton is unfit for agriculture. The tree line\r\nceases on the coast close to Churchill and crosses off to the northwest\r\ntowards the Mackenzie. The country on the mainland about Chesterfield\r\ninlet is quite low. The hills never extend more than three hundred or\r\nfour hundred feet. There are no forests up there, and the only natural\r\nresources would be probably the minerals, the furs, and the sea and lake\r\nfisheries.\r\n\r\n                     THE LURE OF THE BARREN LANDS.\r\n\r\nMr. Hanbury, describing a view in the Barren Lands on July 23, writes in\r\nhis book:—“Artillery lake looked very picturesque in the bright\r\nsunlight; the water, which was of a beautiful blue, was fanned into\r\nripples by the gentle summer breeze. The ‘Barren Ground’ lay on either\r\nside beautifully green, and decked gay with a variety of wild flowers.\r\nIts charm, and the sense of freedom which it gives, are very impressive,\r\nbut cannot be described.”\r\n\r\nThe following is a pretty descriptive bit from Mr. Warburton Pike’s book\r\n“The Barren Grounds of Northern Canada”:—“To the man who is not a lover\r\nof nature in all her moods the Barren Grounds must always be a howling,\r\ndesolate wilderness, but for my part, I can understand the feeling that\r\nprompted Salatha’s answer to the worthy priest, who was explaining to\r\nhim the beauties of Heaven. ‘My father, you have spoken well; you have\r\ntold me that heaven is very beautiful; tell me now one thing more. Is it\r\nmore beautiful than the country of the musk-ox in summer, when sometimes\r\nthe mist blows over the lakes, and sometimes the water is blue, and the\r\nloons cry very often? That is beautiful, and if Heaven is still more\r\nbeautiful, my heart will be glad, and I shall be content to rest there\r\ntill I am very old.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[24] The Geographic Board of Canada has adopted “Dubawnt” as the\r\nstandard spelling of this lake and the river of the same name. The name\r\nis a corruption of the Indian name “Tobatna”, meaning “water shore”. (E.\r\nJ. C.)\r\n\r\n[25] So named by Captain George Back in 1833, out of respect to the\r\nRoyal Artillery, to which distinguished corps some of his crew who\r\njoined him in Montreal belonged, “and from a grateful remembrance of the\r\ndeep interest manifested by its officers for the success of the\r\nexpedition, and of their friendly courtesies” to himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE BARREN LANDS, OR “ARCTIC PRAIRIE.”\r\n\r\n                   Tree Growth and Timber Resources.\r\n\r\n   Phenomenal Extensions of Tree Growth Within the Barren Lands Along\r\n     the Valley of Thelon river.—Black Spruce, Larch, White Spruce,\r\n     Banskian Pine and Birch.—Valuable Timber Along the Thelon,\r\n     About the East End of Great Slave lake and Between Great Bear\r\n     lake and Coppermine river.\r\n\r\nIn his valuable report, Mr. E. A. Preble, of the United States\r\nBiological Survey, states that Coppermine, Thelon, and many of the\r\nsmaller rivers of the Barren Lands are wooded to some extent on their\r\nupper portions, but by far the greater part of the area drained by them\r\nis treeless.\r\n\r\nMr. Preble traces the northern boundary of the great transcontinental\r\nforest from the western shore of Hudson bay to the mouth of the\r\nMackenzie as follows:—“Starting from the mouth of Churchill river,\r\nHudson bay, the tree-line follows the shore closely for a few miles and\r\nthen curves gently inland. Thence it extends northwesterly crossing\r\nNueltin, or Island lake, Ennadai lake on Kazan river and Boyd lake on\r\nthe Dubawnt. Just north of 63 degrees on Artillery lake is the next\r\npoint where we have a definite dividing line. Between the Dubawnt and\r\nArtillery lake is the valley of the upper Thelon or Ark-i-linik, along\r\nwhose banks the forest extends in a narrow line far into the general\r\ntreeless area. From Artillery lake the line extends northwestward to\r\nPoint lake, curving toward the southwest in the interval and crossing\r\nLake Mackay, south of latitude 64 degrees. From Point lake, whose shores\r\nare practically devoid of trees, nearly to latitude 67 degrees the banks\r\nof the Coppermine are so thinly wooded that the river may be taken as\r\nthe approximate boundary of the woods. Spruces occur on the Coppermine\r\nas far north as the mouth of Kendall river, but are absent from the\r\nsummit of the divide between there and Great Bear lake and reappear on\r\nlower Dease river. Between Dease river and the lower Anderson the\r\nboundary of the woods is not well known.”\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered by those familiar with the subject, that, in\r\ndefining the eastern end of the forest line, Mr. Preble has closely\r\nfollowed the definition laid down by Mr. J. B. Tyrrell in the official\r\nreport of his exploration of the country south and east of Dubawnt lakes\r\nand Chesterfield inlet. Mr. Tyrrell states in his report:—\r\n\r\n“The region may be divided into Forests, and Treeless Plains or ‘Barren\r\nLands’, by a line which curves around the bottom of Button bay, and then\r\ncontinues within sight of the shore as far as Hubbart point, beyond\r\nwhich it strikes northwestward almost at right angles to the magnetic\r\nmeridian, crossing Kazan river at the southern narrows of Ennadai lake,\r\nand Telzoa river about the middle of Boyd lake.”\r\n\r\n                   BLACK AND WHITE SPRUCE AND LARCH.\r\n\r\n“The forested country is chiefly wooded with small black spruce (_Picea\r\nnigra_) and larch (_Larix Americana_) while the lowlands are almost\r\neverywhere covered with deep mossy swamps. Proceeding northwards, the\r\nwoods become confined to the lowlands and the tops of the hills remain\r\ntreeless. Such are the conditions of the surface around Kasba and Daly\r\nlakes. Farther northward the wooded plains give place more or less\r\nsuddenly to level or rolling grassy plains, which constitute the Barren\r\nLands. As the forest disappears, much of the surface is covered by deep\r\nfrozen mossy bogs or tundras, but these occur only along the edge of the\r\nforest, and do not form part of the Barren Lands proper.\r\n\r\n“Besides the two species of trees above mentioned, the white spruce\r\n(_Picea alba_) grows to quite a large size on some of the dry estuaries,\r\nand on the stony, well-drained banks of Telzoa river. It extends\r\nnorthward almost to Dubawnt lake, forming a larger tree than either of\r\nthe others. At Churchill, near the shore of Hudson bay, small white\r\nspruce were found to have entirely replaced black spruce in the swamps.\r\nA few miles farther inland, black spruce again takes its normal place in\r\nsimilar swamps, and white spruce almost disappears.\r\n\r\n“Banksian Pine (_Pinus Banksiana_) grows on the sandy plains along Stone\r\nriver, and northward, on dry sandy ridges, as far as Selwyn and Theitaga\r\nlakes, but it does not extend as far north as either spruce or larch.\r\nCanoe Birch (_Betula papyrifera_) grows to a fairly large size at the\r\nhead of Thlewiaza river but as a rule it is a small tree in this region.\r\nIt gradually decreases in size and disappears at the edge of the Barren\r\nLands. Some small aspen trees (_Populus tremuloides_) were seen as far\r\nnorth as Daly lake on Telzoa river, latitude 60°, on the headwaters of\r\nThlewiaza river, and at the mouth of Churchill river on Hudson bay.\r\n\r\nMr. Tyrrell’s expedition of 1893 did not find much timber along Dubawnt\r\nriver. Mr. J. W. Tyrrell (“Through the Sub-Arctics of Canada”) mentions\r\nthat the party found a little clump of white spruce trees on the north\r\nshore of Carey lake on the Dubawnt in latitude 62° 15′ north. Two feet\r\nabove the ground the trunk of the largest tree measured eight feet in\r\ncircumference.\r\n\r\nMr. Tyrrell also states that the southern affluent of Dubawnt lake “has\r\nscattered groves of white spruce on its banks.”\r\n\r\n                        TIMBER ALONG THE THELON.\r\n\r\nThere is considerable timber along the Thelon and the main tributary of\r\nits upper reach, the Hanbury, so named from the original explorer of\r\nboth streams. Mr. Hanbury, describing his exploratory trip,\r\nwrites:—“The peculiarity of the Ark-i-linik (the Indian name then\r\napplied to the Thelon and its tributary the Hanbury) is that, though so\r\nfar north, it is wooded on either bank, and in places one might even say\r\nheavily timbered, spruce trees, with butts measuring one and one-half to\r\ntwo feet across, being by no means uncommon. It is a long way north of\r\nthe limit of trees marked on the maps, and there is a large extent of\r\ncountry to the south of it destitute of trees. I can find no explanation\r\nof this peculiarity from the geological formation, for the same red and\r\nwhite sandstone which prevails nearly the whole length of the river\r\noccurs at places which are without trees.\r\n\r\n“The woods as a whole amount only to a rather deep fringe, the trees for\r\nthe most part being scattered and not continuous. Here and there along\r\nthe banks are spots and short stretches quite bare of timber. After a\r\nshort walk away from the river on either side one reaches the outer edge\r\nof the woodland fringe beyond which the land is typical prairie. Along\r\nthe creeks and effluents, however, the growth extends to a considerable\r\ndistance, in places as far as the eye can reach the trees diminishing in\r\nsize until the spruce is mere scrub.”\r\n\r\nAscending the main branch of the Thelon, Mr. Hanbury describes the\r\ntimber as beginning about fifty miles above the mouth of the river at\r\nBeverly lake. That far northeast he states “spruce of fair-size growth\r\nis to be found, and the woods then increase in size of timber and in\r\nextent until the river divides, the larger branch coming in from the\r\nsouth, the smaller—which we followed up—joining from the west.”\r\n\r\n                       OF GREAT VALUE TO CANADA.\r\n\r\nMr. J. W. Tyrrell, in the official report of his exploration along\r\nHanbury and Thelon rivers for the Dominion government in 1900,\r\nremarks:—“The timber supply of the Thelon should be of great value to\r\nCanada.”\r\n\r\nMr. Tyrrell mentions a grove of spruce on the Thelon, two miles below\r\nthe junction of Hanbury river, and relates that eight miles farther down\r\nstream “well grown spruce trees were plentiful on both banks. Here, and\r\nfor many miles below, the Thelon is a really fine and beautiful river,\r\nhaving grassy banks—well wooded in places by spruce trees—some of\r\nwhich measured some fifteen inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n“The wooded or partially wooded banks of the Thelon extend altogether\r\nfor a distance of about one hundred and seventy miles below the forks of\r\nthe Hanbury. This distance is not to be understood as a continuous\r\nstretch of timber, but over that distance many fine spruce groves, as\r\nwell as more or less continuous thinly scattered trees are found. The\r\nlargest trees measured from twelve to fifteen inches in diameter, but\r\nwould average about six inches.”\r\n\r\nIn his book “Through the Sub-Arctics of Canada” Mr. Tyrrell again refers\r\nto the timber along the Hanbury and the Thelon, writing:—“In the\r\nvalleys of the Thelon and some other rivers there are valuable belts of\r\nspruce and tamarack timber for local supply when required.”\r\n\r\nIn the official report of his long patrol in 1908 Inspector Pelletier\r\nwrites:—“A good amount of wood for fuel is available on Hanbury river.\r\nIn places timber is of fair dimension. In one or two ravines near\r\nDickson canyon I would judge the timber to be of sufficient size to\r\nerect a comfortable log camp.\r\n\r\n                 A SIXTY MILE STRETCH OF SPRUCE TIMBER.\r\n\r\n“The banks of the Thelon are very well stocked with timber. Of course\r\nthere are fairly long stretches on which wood is very scarce,\r\nprincipally at the lower end, but still fuel is found everywhere, either\r\ndrift or standing. The best stretches of solid timber are from about\r\ntwenty miles below the Hanbury and extend for sixty miles. The stretch\r\nis nearly without interruption. There is another stretch of about ten\r\nmiles, fifteen miles below Lookout point, and at numerous other points\r\ngood timber, but in small quantity, is seen. This timber does not extend\r\nvery far inland. It varies from a few yards deep to two or three miles.\r\nIn some parts, the timber extends still farther inland. Lumber of fair\r\nsize from six to ten inches in diameter is abundant. All the timber is\r\nspruce.”\r\n\r\nInspector Pelletier speaks of a ten mile stretch on the Thelon, where\r\nthere “was continuous forest on both banks, and as thick as on any river\r\nin the timbered belt.”\r\n\r\nInspector Pelletier also reports:—“On Beverly lake (Thelon river) any\r\namount of driftwood is to be found, on Aberdeen lake very little, and\r\nbelow none at all.”\r\n\r\n                  THE THELON SPRUCE GROVES PHENOMENAL.\r\n\r\nMr. E. A. Preble, of the United States Biological Survey, in his report\r\nhas this to say as to the growth of timber along the Thelon:—“The\r\nnorthern extension of the coniferous forest along the banks of\r\nnorthward-flowing rivers has already been referred to. The most\r\nremarkable example of this phenomenon is found on the Thelon or\r\nArk-i-linik, a stream tributary to Hudson bay. It was first explored by\r\nHanbury in 1899, and by J. W. Tyrrell during the following season. From\r\na point near latitude sixty-two and one-half degrees, which is as far\r\nsouth as the river has been explored, and which is within the main area\r\nof the Barren Grounds, a more or less continuous belt of spruce borders\r\nthe river as far north as latitude sixty-four and one-half degrees, a\r\ndistance of over two hundred miles by the river. A few species of\r\nwoodland-breeding birds follow these extensions of the forest to their\r\nlimits.”\r\n\r\n                   EASTERN PART OF GREAT SLAVE LAKE.\r\n\r\nInspector Pelletier also gives us some information as to the timber\r\nresources of the eastern part of Great Slave lake and along the canoe\r\nand portage route to Hanbury river. He writes:—“On the south shore of\r\nGreat Slave lake much good timber was met. On the north shore timber\r\ndiminishes very perceptibly in size, and the farther one proceeds the\r\nmore it gets stunted and scattered; only in some favoured spots is\r\ntimber of any size, but no large area. It consists chiefly of spruce,\r\nbirch, poplar and jackpine. At the upper end of the first portage from\r\nGreat Slave lake timber gets very scarce, at French lake a large open\r\nspot and at Acres lake we are practically at the beginning of the\r\nBarrens, although there is a good lot of wood close to the shore and in\r\nsheltered spots. At north end of Burr lake is a nice grove of good sized\r\ntrees. The country gets rocky and barren, grass growing only in favoured\r\nspots.\r\n\r\n“At the southern end of Artillery lake, along the small ravines on the\r\neast bank, is a fair amount of wood good for fuel and building dog\r\nsleighs, but as soon as one crosses Lockhart river where the lake gets\r\nwider, wood is seen here and there only in small bluffs. It is small,\r\nbent and dwarfed by the wind storms and snow. There is very little\r\nsubstance in the soil, and vegetation must be very slow. Trees grow\r\nmostly in the shelter of a bank, whether stone or sand. At about half\r\nway up the lake on the east side the last woods are met; on the edges\r\nthey are low, bent and creepy, as if in readiness to grasp the soil for\r\nsupport to resist the force of the elements. Nothing further grows but\r\nsome grasses in favoured spots, and at the rapids, where there is a lot\r\nof dampness, willows grow between the crevices of upturned boulders.\r\nAbove Kasba lake on the route followed even willows do not grow. In the\r\neddies at the foot of the rapids on Kasba river I have seen sticks, some\r\nof which had been cut with an axe or other tool. Those pieces of wood\r\nwere small but of a size which leads me to believe that somewhere on\r\nClinton-Colden or farther west on Aylmer lake, timber of some kind is to\r\nbe found. These sticks or pieces of wood were very old as if they had\r\nbeen tossed up and washed by water for a long period. Moss grows in\r\nplaces and for fuel purposes a few experiments with the different kinds\r\nwill demonstrate which is the best. We found the black thick sort, which\r\ngrows on the stones, is very light and dry and burns the best. One makes\r\na tunnel with stones and places the door towards the wind, the more wind\r\nand draught the better.”\r\n\r\n               SCATTERED TIMBER EAST OF GREAT SLAVE LAKE.\r\n\r\nIn the report of his trip in 1900, Mr. J. W. Tyrrell also gives us some\r\nglimpses of the timber about the east end of Great Slave lake and the\r\nlakes and river to the east and northeast of that locality. According to\r\nMr. Tyrrell, “Fairchild point (near old Fort Reliance), which is about\r\nten miles in length, is well wooded with white spruce from six to twelve\r\ninches in diameter and is notable as being the source of timber in that\r\nlocality.\r\n\r\n“The shores of Carlton harbour are sparingly wooded with small spruce\r\nand a few Banksian pines. It might be noted here that on Fairchild point\r\na few black poplars were observed, the last seen on our outward journey.\r\n\r\n“At Fort Reliance, here and there, are to be seen the charred remains of\r\nlarge stumps, indicating the apparent recent destruction of the original\r\nforest.\r\n\r\n“The largest young trees, which showed thirty-four to thirty-five years’\r\ngrowth, were from four to six inches in diameter two feet from the\r\nground, and were not of stunted appearance.\r\n\r\n“At the north end of Burr lake there is situated a nice grove of white\r\nspruce timber, containing trees of ten to twelve inches diameter. It\r\nproved to be the last timber of any consequence met with before entering\r\nthe barren lands, excepting some on the west shore of Artillery lake\r\nnear Timber bay.\r\n\r\n“On the western side of Artillery lake, about ten miles from the south\r\nend, the shore is quite well timbered with small spruce and they\r\ncontinue northerly, although thinly scattered, for a distance of twenty\r\nmiles, eight miles farther north than the last grove on the east shore.\r\nThere the woods cease entirely.”\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to recall that Back pointed out that “the pines are\r\nsaid to disappear along Artillery lake.”\r\n\r\nMr. Warburton Pike thus describes the same country at the time he passed\r\nthrough it:—\r\n\r\n“Scattering timber, spruce and birch, clothed the sloping banks to the\r\nsandy shores of the lakes; berries of many kinds grew in profusion; the\r\nportages were short and down hill; and caribou were walking the ridges\r\nand swimming the lakes in every direction. A perfect northern fairyland\r\nit was, and it seemed hard to believe that winter and want could ever\r\npenetrate here.”\r\n\r\n                        TIMBER OF THE FAR NORTH.\r\n\r\nThe first reference to the timber of the northern part of the Barren\r\nLands we find in the report of Samuel Hearne, who in 1771, speaking of\r\nhis discovery of Coppermine river, writes:—“Before I proceed farther on\r\nmy return, it may not be improper to give some account of the river, and\r\nthe country adjacent; its productions, and the animals which constantly\r\ninhabit those dreary regions, as well as those that only migrate thither\r\nin summer, in order to breed and rear their young, unmolested by man.\r\nThat I may do this to better purpose, it will be necessary to go back to\r\nthe place where I first came to the river, which was about forty miles\r\nfrom its mouth. Near the water’s edge there is some wood, but not one\r\ntree grows on or near the top of the hills between which the river runs.\r\nThere appears to have been formerly much greater quantity than there is\r\nat present, but the trees seem to have been set on fire some years ago\r\nand, in consequence, there are at present ten sticks lying on the ground\r\nfor one green one which is growing beside them. The whole timber appears\r\nto have been even in its greatest prosperity of so crooked and dwarfed a\r\ngrowth as to render it of little use for any purpose but firewood.\r\n\r\n“Besides the stunted pines already mentioned, there are some tufts of\r\ndwarf willows; plenty of Wishacumpuckey (as the Indians call it, and\r\nwhich they use as tea); some jackatheypuck, which the natives use as\r\ntobacco; and a few cranberry and heathberry bushes; but not the least\r\nappearance of any fruit.\r\n\r\n“The weeds grow gradually thinner and smaller as you approach the sea,\r\nand the last little tuft of pines that I saw is about thirty miles from\r\nthe mouth of the river, so that we meet with nothing between that spot\r\nand the sea-side but barren hills and marshes.”\r\n\r\nSir John Franklin on his first journey, in 1819-22, reached the upper\r\npart of Coppermine river at Point lake just east of the southern arm of\r\nGreat Bear lake. He found the “valleys on its border intersected with\r\nclusters of spruce trees. On the borders of such of these lakes as\r\ncommunicate with Coppermine river, there are a few groves of spruce\r\ntrees, generally growing on accumulations of sand.”\r\n\r\n                           COPPERMINE VALLEY.\r\n\r\nSir John refers as follows to the timber growths on the small lakes or\r\nexpansions of the Coppermine as observed during the descent of his\r\nparty:—\r\n\r\n“Red Rock lake is in general narrow, its shelving banks are well clothed\r\nwith wood, and even the hills, which attain an elevation of four hundred\r\nor five hundred feet, are ornamented half way up with stunted pines.”\r\n\r\n“At Rock-Nest lake (just north of Red Rock lake) the only wood is the\r\npine, which is twenty or thirty feet high, and about one foot in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\n“At Fairy lake the river flows between banks of sand thinly wooded, and\r\nas we advanced the barren hills approached the water’s edge.”\r\n\r\nWest of that part of Coppermine river which is nearest to Great Bear\r\nlake, Sir John Richardson in 1826 said that they met with wooded valleys\r\nand saw much wood in the valleys far to the west. From the height of\r\nland between Coppermine river and Great Bear lake they had an extensive\r\nview of a lower and well wooded country.\r\n\r\nOf the country above Bloody falls, on the Coppermine, Sir John Franklin\r\nwrites:—“In the existence of many scattered stumps of decayed spruce\r\nfir trees, and the total absence of young plants, one might be led to\r\ninfer that of late years the climate has deteriorated and that the\r\ncountry was no longer capable of supporting trees so near the sea coast\r\nas it had formerly done. The largest tree in the clump in which we\r\nbivouacked had a circumference of thirty-seven inches at the height of\r\nfour feet from the ground. Its annual layers were very numerous and fine\r\nand indicated centuries of growth, but I was unable to reckon them.”\r\n\r\n               FINE SPRUCE NORTHEAST OF GREAT BEAR LAKE.\r\n\r\nIn 1848, writing of the area between Dease bay (the extreme northeastern\r\narm of Great Bear lake) and Coppermine river, Sir John Franklin\r\nstates:—“At two we came to another branch of the Kendall, which runs\r\nthrough a ravine of red and spotted sandstone, under whose shelter there\r\ngrew a remarkably fine grove of white spruces. The best grown tree\r\nmeasured sixty-three inches in circumference and did not taper\r\nperceptibly for twenty feet from its root. Its total height was from\r\nforty to fifty feet. Other trees of equal girth tapered more, and one\r\ndecayed trunk, which lay on the ground, looked to be considerably\r\nthicker.”\r\n\r\nHanbury mentions that along the north shore of Barry island in Bathurst\r\ninlet he “picked up some drift sticks which evidently must have come\r\nfrom Hood river” which flows into Arctic waters some distance east of\r\nCoppermine river.\r\n\r\nSir George Back describes the banks of Backs river as being rocky and\r\ntreeless (“without a single tree on the whole line of its banks”).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE BARREN LANDS OR “ARCTIC PRAIRIE”.\r\n\r\n                           Economic Minerals.\r\n\r\n   Deposits of Native Copper in the Far North.—Several Areas West of\r\n     Hudson bay Contain Rocks Similar to Those at Sudbury.—Belts of\r\n     Huronian Rocks that are Expected by Geologists to be Eventually\r\n     of Great Economic Importance.—Vast Probable Mineral Bearing\r\n     Country in the Interior Which Can Now be Reached Via\r\n     Chesterfield Inlet.—Iron, Gold and Silver in Small Quantities\r\n     North of Lake Athabaska.—Free Gold in Melville Peninsula.—\r\n     Lignite and Soft Coal Along the Arctic Coast.\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial tradition has ascribed to the great northern\r\nwilderness which we have come to know as the Barren Lands or Barren\r\nGrounds, untold mineral wealth, and what tradition has so long asserted\r\nis substantiated by the testimony of scientific experts.\r\n\r\nThe original exploratory expedition despatched into the country, that\r\nunder Samuel Hearne in 1771, was inspired by the desire of the Hudson’s\r\nBay Company to locate the copper mines in the far north of which the\r\nnatives spoke to the pioneer traders.\r\n\r\nMany of the principal witnesses examined before the British\r\nparliamentary committee of 1749 referred to the prospective mineral\r\nwealth of the country northwest of Hudson bay. Mr. Joseph Robson, at\r\nwhose instance largely the investigation was held, testified that he had\r\nseen copper worn by the Indians about their necks and arms. He had also\r\nseen about a pound and a half of copper ore, which he understood from\r\nthe Indians they had brought from a great distance.\r\n\r\nAnother witness, Alexander Browne, who had been six years in the\r\ncompany’s service at Hudson bay as surgeon, informed the Committee that\r\nhe had seen both copper and copper ore at Prince of Wales’ Fort on\r\nChurchill river, which the northern Indians informed him they brought\r\nfrom an isthmus of land which lies by a lake at the farthest extent of\r\ntheir country. It was hard to ascertain the distance from the accounts\r\nof the Indians, but he judged it to be about three or four hundred\r\nmiles. He never heard the Indians say whether there was a passage to\r\nthis place from Hudson bay by water, but they informed him their river\r\nran by it. They brought down the copper for ornaments, and the ore at\r\nthe request of Governor Norton. Witness had seen about four or five\r\npounds of it, both before it was smelted, and after, and he\r\n\r\n                       TOOK IT TO BE A RICH ORE,\r\n\r\nbut did not understand metals. He had heard of lead ore at Hudson bay,\r\nbut never saw any. He never saw the Indians smelt the copper, but they\r\ninformed him that the earth was washed from the ore by showers, and that\r\nthey smelted it on a fire until it ran, and then beat it, it being very\r\nmalleable. Witness never heard of a copper mine on the large arm of the\r\nsea, but the ore was brought down by canoes to the open sea, and the\r\nrivulet which washed the said copper is not known to have any\r\ncommunication with Hudson bay, the mine being about fifteen miles from\r\nthe open sea, by the accounts of the Indians. He believed that the\r\nIndians came a little to the northward of Whale cove, “which bears a\r\npoint or two to the west of the north from Churchill.” If the Indians\r\nwere encouraged they would bring great quantities of ore, as well as\r\nsmelted copper to Whale cove, but if persons were sent up to the mine\r\nthey would labour under a difficulty for want of fuel, the country\r\nproducing no wood, and what the Indians smelt, they do in small\r\nquantities with moss.\r\n\r\nDoctor Thompson, another of the company’s surgeons, testified that he\r\nhad heard the natives talk of a sea to the westward, which, by their\r\naccounts, is not far distant, and of a copper mine, which lay on the\r\nside of a “Streight”, which takes them five days in crossing. They\r\ndescribed the water of this “Streight” to be very deep, and they could\r\nnot reach the bottom with two deerskins cut into thongs. If a sloop\r\ncould be brought alongside this copper mine, they say they could fill\r\nit, in a little time, and by their account, this “Streight” has a\r\ncommunication both with the bay and the south sea.\r\n\r\nDoctor Thompson further informed the Committee, “that he went with\r\nCaptain Middleton on the discovery of the North-West-Passage, and\r\nlikewise with the last adventurers.”\r\n\r\nChristopher Bannister, who had been armourer and gunsmith to the\r\nHudson’s Bay Company, and had resided in the bay about twenty-two years,\r\ninformed the Committee that he had seen lead ore at Moose river, which\r\ncame from the northward, but he could not say whence. He had seen a good\r\nquantity of it, and some of it was tried by Mr. Longdon’s apprentice,\r\nand it seemed extraordinary good lead, the boy\r\n\r\n                    MAKING A PAIR OF BUCKLES OF IT.\r\n\r\nThe witness could not say what proportion the lead bore to the ore. The\r\nboy put in a piece of ore as big as a man’s fist, and got lead enough to\r\nmake a pair of large buckles. The witness was sure nothing was put in\r\nbut the ore, none being present but himself, and the boy who brought it\r\ndown. That was about three years previous to the investigation and\r\nwitness never saw any lead ore at any other time. He had seen copper\r\nfrequently brought down by the northern Indians, a piece of which he\r\nproduced before the committee. He said he had seen great quantities of\r\nit there, and was informed by a young man, who is now at Hudson bay that\r\nthe Indians told him that it was brought from a mine, in search of which\r\nthe young man would gladly have gone.”\r\n\r\n                     HEARNE AT THE COPPER DEPOSITS.\r\n\r\nIn the record of his famous trip (pages 173 to 176) Hearne makes the\r\nfollowing references to his investigation into the subject of the\r\ntraditional copper mines of the Indians on Coppermine river:—“After a\r\nsleep of five or six hours we once more set out, and walked eighteen or\r\nnineteen miles to the south-southeast when we arrived at one of the\r\ncopper mines, which lies, from the river’s mouth about south-southeast,\r\ndistant about twenty-nine or thirty miles. This mine, if it deserve that\r\nappellation, is no more than an entire jumble of rocks and gravel, which\r\nhas been rent so many ways by an earthquake. Through these ruins there\r\nruns a small river, but no parts of it, at the time I was there, was\r\nmore than knee-deep. The Indians who were the occasion of my undertaking\r\nthis journey represented this mine to be so rich and valuable, that if a\r\nfactory were built at the river, a ship might be ballasted with the ore,\r\ninstead of stone, and that with the same ease and despatch as is done\r\nwith stones at Churchill river. By their account the hills were entirely\r\ncomposed of that metal, all in handy lumps, like a heap of pebbles. But\r\ntheir account differed so much from the truth, that I and almost all of\r\nmy companions expended near four hours in search of some of this metal,\r\nwith such poor success, that among us all, only one piece of any size\r\ncould be found. This, however, was remarkably good, and weighed above\r\nfour pounds. I believe the copper has formerly been in much greater\r\nplenty, for in many places, both on the surface and in the cavities and\r\ncrevices of the rocks, the stones are much tinged with verdigrise.\r\n\r\n“Before Churchill river was settled by the Hudson’s Bay Company, which\r\nwas not more than fifty years previous to this journey being undertaken,\r\nthe Northern Indians had no other metal but copper among them, except a\r\nsmall quantity of iron work, which a party of them who visited York Fort\r\nabout the year one thousand seven hundred and thirteen, or one thousand\r\nseven hundred and fourteen, purchased, and a few pieces of old iron\r\nfound at Churchill river, which had undoubtedly been left there by\r\nCaptain Monk. This being the case, numbers of them from all quarters\r\nused every summer to resort to these hills in search of copper; of which\r\nthey made hatchets, ice-chisels, bayonets (sic), knives, awls,\r\narrow-heads, etc. The many\r\n\r\n                       PATHS THAT HAD BEEN BEATEN\r\n\r\nby the Indians on these occasions and which are yet, in many places,\r\nvery perfect, especially on the dry ridges and hills, is surprising; in\r\nthe valleys and marshy grounds, however, they are mostly grown over with\r\nherbage, so as not to be discerned.\r\n\r\n“The Copper Indians set a great value on their native metal even to this\r\nday, and prefer it to iron, for almost every use except that of a\r\nhatchet, a knife, and an awl; for these three necessary implements,\r\ncopper makes but a very poor substitute.\r\n\r\n“There is a strange tradition among these people, that the first person\r\nwho discovered these mines was a woman, and that she conducted them to\r\nthe place for several years, but as she was the only woman in the\r\ncompany, some of the men took such liberties with her as made her vow\r\nrevenge on them, and she is said to have been a great conjurer.\r\nAccordingly when the men had loaded themselves with copper, and were\r\ngoing to return, she refused to accompany them, and said she would sit\r\non the mine till she sunk into the ground, and that the copper should\r\nsink with her. The next year, when the men went for more copper, they\r\nfound her sunk up to the waist, though still alive and the quantity of\r\ncopper much decreased, and on their repeating their visit the following\r\nyear, she had quite disappeared, and all the principal part of the mine\r\nwith her, so that after that period nothing remained on the surface but\r\na few small pieces, and those were scattered at a considerable distance\r\nfrom each other. Before that period they say the copper lay on the\r\nsurface in such large heaps, that the Indians had nothing to do but turn\r\nit over, and pick up such pieces as would best suit the different uses\r\nfor which they intended it.”\r\n\r\nSir Alexander Mackenzie is authority for the statement that there was a\r\ntradition among the Chipewyan Indians that their ancestors first reached\r\nthe continent of America at Coppermine river. “Where they first made\r\nland, the ground was covered with copper, over which a body of earth had\r\nsince been collected to the depth of a man’s height.” The tradition is\r\ninteresting as indicating the fact that the Indians knew of the famous\r\ncopper deposits for many generations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Some of the Difficulties of Northern\r\nTransportation:—Crossing a Swamp.]\r\n\r\n                       SIR JOHN FRANKLIN’S VISIT.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir John Franklin’s party in 1821 visited Copper mountains they\r\nfound only a few small pieces of native copper. Franklin says in his\r\nnarrative (p. 340) “The annual visits which the Copper Indians were\r\naccustomed to make to these mountains when most of their weapons and\r\nutensils were made of copper, have been discontinued since they have\r\nbeen enabled to obtain a supply of ice chisels and other instruments of\r\niron by the establishment of trading posts near their hunting grounds.\r\nThat none of those who accompanied us had visited them for many years\r\nwas evident from their ignorance of the spots most abundant in metal.”\r\n\r\nDoctor G. M. Dawson, director of the Geological Survey of Canada,\r\nexamined before the Senate committee of 1888, stated that as to the\r\nBarren Lands, it was a fact that an immense district—nearly half a\r\nmillion square miles of country—was at that date, except along its\r\nwatercourses, as utterly unknown as the interior of Africa. Coppermine\r\nriver runs through the Barren Lands and so does Back’s Great Fish river,\r\non which there are mineral indications. There was every reason to\r\nbelieve that there is a repetition along Coppermine river, and in its\r\nvicinity of those rocks which contain copper, on Lake Superior and which\r\nhave proved so rich there. At the time Doctor Dawson gave his evidence,\r\nhe stated, it seemed to be beyond the reach of the prospector. The\r\nHudson’s Bay Company sent Hearne up there in the latter part of the\r\npreceding century to discover where the copper found in the hands of the\r\nnatives came from, but he could do nothing but report that he found\r\ncopper there. The sea to the north was ice-bound, so he did not see his\r\nway to utilizing it. Hearne travelled the barren grounds more than any\r\none else, but he was not a scientific explorer. He travelled with the\r\nIndians in winter under circumstances of great hardship, and Doctor\r\nDawson said he believed we had not yet got sufficient information up to\r\nthat date about these “Barren Grounds.” What mineral discoveries might\r\nbe made there it was impossible to say.\r\n\r\nBishop Clut informed the same committee that copper was found on\r\nCoppermine river in great pieces. Witness had seen little crosses made\r\nof it by the savages themselves when they were not able to have other\r\nmetal.\r\n\r\n                   SIMILAR TO LAKE SUPERIOR DEPOSITS.\r\n\r\nMr. J. B. Tyrrell, in his paper read before the British Association for\r\nthe Advancement of Science at its Toronto meeting in 1879, mentioned\r\nthat the descriptions of Doctor Richardson, who visited the locality of\r\nCoppermine river in 1821 and again in 1826, show that some of the rocks\r\nwhich occur on the banks of the Coppermine are precisely similar to\r\nthose on Dubawnt and Baker lakes, though they also indicate the\r\noccurrence of the underlying Animikie series, and they also show that\r\nthe conditions under which the copper there occurs are very like those\r\nunder which it occurs on the south side of Lake Superior.\r\n\r\nThe Keewenawan rocks (so called from the district so named on the shore\r\nof Lake Superior) would appear, according to Mr. Tyrrell, to have been\r\nfirst seen by Doctor Richardson on Red Rock lake, a short distance below\r\nPoint lake, on Coppermine river, and thence they occupy the banks of the\r\nriver through most of the distance down to its mouth.\r\n\r\nContinuing to discuss Doctor Richardson’s report, Mr. Tyrrell proceeds\r\nin his paper to say:—“At ‘Rocky Defile,’ ‘the walls of the rapid’ are\r\nsaid to ‘consist of a very dark purplish red, compact felspar rock,\r\nalternating with a rock which is composed of a light reddish and greyish\r\nfelspar and quartz, the former indistinctly crystallized,’ evidently\r\nreferring to different varieties of quartz-porphyry or porphyrite. ‘This\r\nrock is everywhere exposed in the bed of the river for ten or twelve\r\nmiles below the rapid.’\r\n\r\n“In the beds of the torrents flowing into the main river he (Richardson)\r\nfound many rock fragments, most of which were probably derived from rock\r\nin places in the vicinity, and the list might readily be duplicated from\r\nthe copper-bearing rocks of Lake Superior; he mentions ‘fragments of\r\nreddish grey, granular, foliated limestone, of deep red sandstone, of\r\ngray sandstone, of red syenite. There also occur fragments of pale red\r\nsandstone, composed principally of quartz and a little felspar, with\r\nimbedded circular concretions of quartz, and of reddish quartzite\r\nsandstone. Fragments were also found of dark-greenish felpathose trap,\r\nof greenstone, of dark flesh-red felspar in granular concretions, with\r\nimbedded patches of hornblende, of red felspar partly coloured with\r\nhornblende, and containing amygdaloidal portions of prehnite.’\r\n\r\n                           COPPER MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n“Copper mountains consist principally of trap rocks. The great mass of\r\nthe rock in the mountains seems to consist of felspar in various\r\nconditions; sometimes in the form of felspar-rock or claystone,\r\nsometimes coloured by hornblende and approaching to greenstone, but most\r\ngenerally in the form of dark reddish brown amygdaloid. The amygdaloidal\r\nmasses contained in the amygdaloid are either entirely pistacite\r\n(epidote), or pistacite enclosing calc-spar. Scales of native copper are\r\nvery generally disseminated through this rock, through a species of trap\r\ntuff which nearly resembles it, and also through a reddish sandstone on\r\nwhich it appears to rest. The rough, and in general rounded and more\r\nelevated parts of the mountain are composed of the amygdaloid but\r\nbetween the eminences there occur many narrow and deep valleys, which\r\nare bounded by perpendicular mural precipices of greenstone. It is in\r\nthese valleys, among the loose soil that the Indians search for copper;\r\nmasses of epidote containing native copper; of trap rock with associated\r\nnative copper, green malachite, copper glance or variegated copper ore,\r\nof greenish gray prehnite in trap with disseminated native copper; the\r\ncopper in some specimens was crystallized in rhomboidal dodecahedrons.\r\nWe also found some large tabular fragments, evidently portions of a vein\r\nconsisting of prehnite, associated with calcareous spar and native\r\ncopper. The Indians dig wherever they observe the prehnite lying on the\r\nsoil, experience having taught them that the largest pieces of copper\r\nare found associated with it. The Indians report that they have found\r\ncopper in every part of this range, which they have examined for thirty\r\nor forty miles to the northwest. We afterwards found some ice-chisels in\r\npossession of the Esquimaux, twelve or fourteen inches long and half an\r\ninch in diameter, formed of pure copper.”\r\n\r\n“The surrounding country is underlain by a light-brownish red sandstone\r\nand gray slate clay in horizontal strata, cut here and there by dykes of\r\ngreenstone.\r\n\r\n“It is hardly possible to imagine two more similar sets of conditions in\r\nsuch widely separated localities, as in Copper mountains and on Keewena\r\npoint (Lake Superior), the native copper occurring in both places\r\nassociated with prehnite and epidote, chiefly in an amygdaloid, cut by\r\ndykes of greenstone.\r\n\r\n                  LONG RANGE OF COPPER-BEARING ROCKS.\r\n\r\n“The copper-bearing rocks would seem to extend along the Arctic coast,\r\nboth east and west of Coppermine river, for about five hundred miles in\r\nall, and probably many of the smaller islands off the coast are also of\r\nthe same rocks and the total area covered by these rocks undoubtedly\r\namounts to many thousands of square miles.\r\n\r\n“Comparing the early account of the occurrence of native copper on Lake\r\nSuperior with the accounts which we now possess of the copper on\r\nCoppermine river, and considering the enormous extent of the northern\r\ndeposit, we have reasonable grounds for hope that before many years the\r\nCoppermine area will produce as much copper as is now mined in northern\r\nMichigan. The amount mined there in 1896 was one hundred and forty-four\r\nmillion pounds, valued at between fifteen and sixteen million dollars,\r\nor about a sixth of the total amount of copper mined in the world that\r\nyear.”\r\n\r\n                 A RECENT VISIT TO THE COPPER COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1902, having spent the winter with the Eskimos, Mr.\r\nDavid T. Hanbury made an examination of some of the places along the\r\nArctic coast where the natives obtain copper for their implements. He\r\nwas first informed that the copper deposits were to be found on Dease\r\nstrait, but later ascertained that the islands in Bathurst inlet are the\r\nsource of supply, and proceeded thither. Mr. Hanbury from the natives on\r\nFitzgerald islands obtained a good many copper articles, such as\r\nsnow-dags, ice-chisels, etc. They appeared to be rich in copper\r\nimplements. They stated that some of their copper had been obtained in\r\nVictoria Land, and some from the islands to the north.\r\n\r\nShortly after landing on Barry island in Bathurst inlet, two small\r\nfragments of copper were picked up by one of his Eskimos. Mr. Hanbury\r\nproceeds, in his book, “Sport and Travel in the Northland of\r\nCanada”:—“The next day we devoted to examining the rock formation and\r\nsearching for copper. We were successful in finding the copper, which\r\nappears to be abundant and widely distributed. Whether it would ever be\r\nworth working is another matter, and one on which I am not competent to\r\ngive an opinion.\r\n\r\n“The underlying basalt dips west at an angle of about twenty-five\r\ndegrees, and it is in this rock that the native copper occurs. The\r\ncopper is plentiful, for the quantity we obtained was found after but a\r\nbrief search, and on a neighbouring island, Kun-nu-yuk, a mass of copper\r\nhad just been found, so large that a man could hardly lift it. There\r\nalso copper is found in the tide-way. The whole of the lower levels on\r\nBarry island are covered with debris from the basalt, and where the rock\r\nhas been disintegrated by weathering,\r\n\r\n                         COPPER HAS FALLEN OUT,\r\n\r\nso that flakes of the metal may be found along the seashore. In many\r\nplaces, too, green patches indicate that nuggets or flakes of copper\r\nhave recently fallen out from their matrix.\r\n\r\n“The copper-bearing rock also contains crystalline quartz some of which\r\nforms beautiful amethystine veins, of which some specimens were taken.\r\nThere is here some further evidence of coastal elevation in the\r\noccurrence of saucer-shaped lines of water-worn debris at from twenty to\r\nforty feet above the present level of high tides.\r\n\r\n“The question whether it would ever pay to work the native copper of\r\nthese regions remains for the consideration of experts. I have always\r\nunderstood that native copper occurring in small flakes or nuggets and\r\nsparsely distributed, is of but little practical value, and that copper\r\ncan only, as a rule, be successfully worked from ores that are rich and\r\neasy of access. Much depends doubtless on its abundance and regularity\r\nof distribution. This island, Barry island, or Iglor-yu-ullig, is\r\nseveral miles in length, and perhaps three or four miles across. The\r\nisland to the south-southeast, Kun-nu-yuk, is still larger, besides\r\nwhich there is an island to the southwest which has given much copper,\r\nand there are copper-yielding islands to the north. The copper-bearing\r\nformation holds good everywhere except on the summit cappings of the\r\nislands.”\r\n\r\nLater Mr. Hanbury examined a part of Lewis island also in Bathurst\r\ninlet. He relates in his book:—“At the northwest point of Lewis island,\r\nBathurst inlet, we stopped to smoke. The formation of rock being similar\r\nto that on Barry island we commenced to search for copper, which proved\r\nto be plentiful. First of all only a few flakes could be found, but the\r\nlonger we searched the more plentiful did the copper become. Finally\r\n\r\n                           IT GOT TOO COMMON\r\n\r\nand we resumed our journey. The metal occurred in flakes and small\r\nchunks; the former were wedged in the rock always vertically. The rock\r\nwas easily knocked to pieces by a light tap with the axe, the cleavage\r\nbeing both vertical and horizontal. Between two and three pounds of this\r\nnative copper were picked up in the course of half or three-quarters of\r\nan hour, while we rested. The metal appeared to be very persistent in\r\nits occurrence in the partly decomposed basalt of which all the islands\r\nwe passed that day consisted. The flakes of copper seemed to be always\r\nvertical when in their rock matrix. The rocks of this island, where they\r\nare not disintegrated, are well smoothed by glacial action, and the\r\nstriæ are numerous and distinctly trend south and southeast.”\r\n\r\nWriting of a more northerly point on Lewis island, also visited, Mr.\r\nHanbury (p. 266) writes:—“Although we did not find so much copper here,\r\nthe green marks on the rocks were more numerous, but we did not spend an\r\nhour altogether in the search. One of our Eskimos knew of a large mass\r\nof copper on the southwest shore of the island, which he stated to be as\r\nmuch as five feet in length and three inches thick. It protruded from\r\nthe rocks under the water, it was said, but there was too much ice for\r\nus to find the copper. A piece of quartz with copper ore and native\r\ncopper was picked up on the seashore. Another specimen of the\r\ncopper-bearing rock here is a decomposed basalt, fine grained, and\r\nvesicular.”\r\n\r\nAscending Kendall river on his way to the headwaters of the Dease,\r\nwhence he descended to Great Bear lake, Mr. Hanbury relates:—“We had\r\nthe good luck to meet the Eskimos from the Arctic coast, who resort to\r\nthis river to obtain wood for their sleighs. These natives had never set\r\neyes on a white man before, and had no articles of civilization\r\nwhatever. They were all dressed in deerskins, and armed with long bows,\r\narrows and spears,\r\n\r\n                      BEATEN OUT OF NATIVE COPPER.\r\n\r\nThe use of tobacco was quite unknown to them, and firearms they had only\r\nheard about. They gave me a good deal of information about their country\r\nand the copper deposits along the Arctic coast, and I obtained from them\r\nseveral copper implements, such as dags, spear and arrow-heads, needles,\r\netc., all beaten out of native copper, giving them in exchange knives,\r\nfiles and needles, which last appeared to have by far the most value in\r\ntheir eyes,”\r\n\r\nMr. Wm. Beech of Churchill, in a communication to the press in 1911,\r\nstated that he had noticed that the Eskimos who visit Churchill yearly\r\nhave nearly all their tools, such as snow-knives, ice-chisels, and\r\nfish-hooks, made out of native copper. They use copper tops over their\r\npipes while smoking, and any break in their guns is usually mended by a\r\nstrip of native copper.\r\n\r\nSo much for the deposits of native copper along the northern sea coast\r\nof the Barren Lands and on the islands off the coast, which were the\r\nmeans of originally attracting attention to the mineral wealth of this\r\nvast region.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably the most comprehensive review of the geological features\r\nof the Barren Lands with respect to the prospective development of the\r\ncountry’s mineral resources was that made by Mr. J. Burr Tyrrell in his\r\npaper read before the British Association for the Advancement of Science\r\nat Toronto in 1897 on the resources of the Barren Lands. The review in\r\nquestion was so thorough that no excuse is needed for quoting it here at\r\nlength. Mr. Tyrrell wrote:—“It is to the minerals of this region that\r\nwe must look for any large contributions to the national wealth, and\r\nfailing these it is difficult to see how the country can be any thing\r\nbut a serious burden on those Canadians who live in the midst of more\r\ncongenial surroundings. What are the prospects of finding minerals of\r\nsufficient value to induce people to open easy means of communication\r\nwith that northern country, and to settle in it? Let us examine this\r\nquestion ground for hope in the future of\r\n\r\n                     A SUB-ARCTIC MINING PROVINCE.\r\n\r\n“The western arm of the Archaean horseshoe, around which the remainder\r\nof the American continent has been built up during successive geological\r\nages, strikes the west coast of Hudson bay near Churchill, and thence\r\nextends northward, with an average breadth of from five hundred to six\r\nhundred miles to Arctic ocean. This Archaean belt is composed chiefly of\r\nLaurentian and Huronian rocks, but in the depressions are some large\r\nareas of rocks of a later age.\r\n\r\n“As the only exact geological information at present available is that\r\ncollected by the two expeditions sent out by the Canadian Geological\r\nSurvey in 1893 and 1894 which I had the honour to lead, I shall describe\r\nthe rocks as seen on those two expeditions and afterwards attempt to\r\nbring together such other information as has been recorded by others,\r\nand assign to it such value as it would seem to possess.\r\n\r\n“The Laurentian system, as here seen, consists almost exclusively of\r\ncrystalline, massive, or altered crushed and contorted rocks of the\r\n‘Basement Complex’, consisting of granites and diorites, and granite and\r\ndiorite gneisses. As a rule, the massive and foliated rocks are very\r\nsimilar in composition being probably different phases of the same fluid\r\nor semi-fluid magma. These rocks are so similar to the Laurentian rocks\r\nof the northern Ontario, which are familiar to any one who has spent a\r\nsummer in Muskoka or in Thousand islands, that it is unnecessary to\r\ndescribe them in greater detail here. They are not usually rich in\r\nvaluable minerals except where they come in contact with the overlying\r\nHuronian rocks.\r\n\r\n“On Dubawnt river they underlie the country northward from Daly lake,\r\nand thence continue northeastward along the west shore of Dubawnt lake\r\nand down Dubawnt river to Lady Marjorie lake, over which distance they\r\nwere often seen in contact with overlying Huronian and Cambrian strata.\r\nNorth of Lady Marjorie lake they disappear under the Cambrian\r\nsandstones, and they were not again seen until the Cambrian belt was\r\ncrossed and the north shore of Schultz lake was reached.\r\n\r\n“On Kazan river they extend from Ennadai lake to beyond Yathkyed lake,\r\nwith the exception of a small Huronian area near Angikuni lake.\r\n\r\n“On the low flat shore of Hudson bay, between Seal river and Cape\r\nEskimo, the few rock exposures seen were of granite and gneiss of\r\ntypical Laurentian aspect. For forty miles north of Cape Eskimo no rock\r\nin place was seen, and thence northward to Baird bay some of the points\r\nwere seen to consist of granite and gneiss, though the shore generally\r\nwas underlain by Huronian rocks.\r\n\r\n“On the upper portion of Ferguson river Laurentian rocks prevail and\r\nsimilar granites and gneisses occur along the north shore of Baker lake,\r\nand down both shores of Chesterfield inlet to its mouth, whence they\r\nextend southward along the shore of Hudson bay to a short distance north\r\nof Baker’s foreland. Any information which we possess about geology of\r\nGreat Fish river and Coppermine river would seem to show that the\r\nLaurentian granites and gneisses outcrop with greater or less frequency\r\nalong their banks, so that we may safely infer that the Barren Lands are\r\nlargely underlain by these ancient igneous rocks, and consequently there\r\nare large areas which will not produce valuable minerals.\r\n\r\n“But as farther south we find quartzite, greywackes, and highly altered\r\neruptive rocks of Huronian age, folded in here and there with typical\r\nLaurentian rocks, so in the far north we may confidently expect to find\r\nthe same set of conditions prevailing.\r\n\r\n“Such is to be found the case in the country lately examined immediately\r\nwest of Hudson bay, where several areas of Huronian rocks, precisely\r\nsimilar to\r\n\r\n                        THOSE FOUND AT SUDBURY,\r\n\r\nLake of the Woods, and at many places around Lakes Huron and Superior,\r\nhave been discovered. The largest of these areas extends more or less\r\ncontinuously for one hundred and twenty miles along the west coast of\r\nHudson bay, from near Baker’s foreland to a point forty-five miles north\r\nof Cape Eskimo, and from the bay shore for seventy miles inland on the\r\ncourse of Ferguson river. A smaller area crosses Dubawnt river between\r\nSchultz and Baker lakes, a third occurs on the Kazan river below\r\nAngikuni lake, a fourth was recognized in the basin of Ennadai lake.\r\n\r\n“Two more areas are represented by outcrops of white clastic quartzite\r\non the north shore of Dubawnt lake, and on the east shore of Wharton\r\nlake.\r\n\r\n“The rocks constituting the system in this region have been divided into\r\nthree more or less distinct groups, viz: Marble island quartzites; the\r\ngreenish quartzites and greywackes; and the more or less highly altered\r\nand often schistose diabases and gabbros.\r\n\r\n“The Marble island quartzites are composed of hard white quartzite,\r\nconsisting of more or less rounded grains of quartz, of fairly regular\r\nsize, cemented together by interstitial silica. They are distinctly\r\nstratified in thick and thin beds, and the surfaces of the beds are\r\noften covered with beautiful ripple-markings. The thicker beds also\r\noften show distinct false bedding. They are usually in a more or less\r\ninclined position, but they were nowhere seen to be very much crumpled\r\nor squeezed into minute folds. These quartzites on the north shore of\r\nQuartzite lake dip regularly northwestward, away from a hill of diabase\r\nwhich lies to the south, and the latter therefore probably underlies the\r\nquartzite, though it is not necessarily older than it. In other places\r\nvery little evidence was obtained of the relative ages of the white\r\nquartzite and the other parts of the Huronian. However, it would seem\r\nprobable that, in the region near the shore of Hudson bay, this\r\nquartzite is\r\n\r\n                    THE OLDEST PART OF THE HURONIAN,\r\n\r\nand that the diabases, and other basic eruptions which are associated\r\nwith it, have been intruded beneath it, and have also flowed over it.\r\nThat Marble island quartzites were once spread over a large portion of\r\nthe region under consideration is shown, not so much by the few\r\nscattered outlines here mentioned, as by the fact that the overlying\r\nCambrian conglomerates, which cover large areas between Dubawnt and\r\nBaker lakes, are composed chiefly of pebbles of this white quartzite.\r\n\r\n“Dark green eruptive rocks, chiefly diabase, are largely developed in\r\nthe Huronian, composing a considerable proportion of the rocks of the\r\nsystem. In many cases these rocks have been crushed and sheared, a slaty\r\ncleavage or schistose structure has been superinduced, and the original\r\nminerals have been broken and altered, both in their shape and\r\ncomposition. In other cases the rock remains massive, or there is\r\ndeveloped in it a concretionary or bomblike structure, the bombs, often\r\na foot or two in diameter, being usually separated by somewhat schistose\r\nbands, which differ slightly in colour from the rest of the rock.\r\n\r\n“On the east side of Hudson bay this rock was found to have,\r\ndisseminated through it, a large amount of both iron and copper pyrites,\r\nwhile these minerals were often found collected somewhat more closely\r\ntogether in the numerous veins of quartz and calc-spar which almost\r\neverywhere traversed the rock. No large deposits of the sulphides were\r\nseen, but when they are so freely distributed through the mass of the\r\nrock it is not at all improbable that large masses may be found\r\nsegregated out along the zones where these green schists are in contact\r\nwith masses of eruptive granite or gneiss. Very little of the vein rock\r\nhas been collected for assay, but some pieces of vein quartz, picked up\r\nby Doctor Rae near the south side of Corbett inlet, were found to\r\n\r\n                     CARRY A SMALL AMOUNT OF GOLD.\r\n\r\n“On Great Fish river, Mr. Pike speaks of the ironstone formation, of\r\ndark fissile slates or schists, probably belonging to the Huronian\r\nsystem extending down the river from Musk-Ox lake to Beechey lake, a\r\ndistance of seventy-five miles.\r\n\r\n“The shores of Point lake, one of the expansions of Coppermine river,\r\nhave been described by Sir John Richardson, who passed through that\r\ncountry in company with Sir John Franklin in 1821, and from his\r\ndescriptions there is no difficulty in recognising the Huronian rocks.\r\nThe following is his description of the rocks, slightly\r\ncondensed:—Greywacke passing into greywacke slate, greywacke with small\r\nimbedded crystals of hornblende, dark greenish or blackish grey clay\r\nslate. Several of the islands in the lake consist of greenstone. A rock\r\nstanding apart from the neighboring hills on the border of the lake,\r\nhaving a rounded summit, but bounded on three sides by mural precipices\r\nabout two hundred feet high, is composed of compact earthy greenstone,\r\ncontaining disseminated iron pyrites, covered with layers of greenstone\r\nslate. On the north side of the lake there is a high bluff hill with a\r\nprecipitous side, which seems to consist principally of a conglomerate.\r\nThe basis is earthy-clay slate. The embedded masses have an ellipsoidal\r\nform and smooth surface, are from one to two feet in diameter and appear\r\nto consist of the same material as the basis, but impregnated with much\r\nsilica, and not showing evident slaty structure. When broken they\r\npresent an even fine-grained fracture.\r\n\r\n“‘During our first and second days’ journey down Point lake from the\r\nabove mentioned encampment, being eleven and one-half miles on a\r\nwest-northwest course, the rocks we had an opportunity of examining\r\nconsisted of greenish grey clay-slate, generally having a curved\r\nstructure, and splitting into slates of very unequal thickness.’\r\n\r\n“From these few isolated and widely separated occurrences it may be seen\r\nthat, as in the Archaean areas of northern and western Ontario, so on\r\nthe Barren Lands, Huronian rocks occur at more or less frequent\r\nintervals, squeezed in between adjacent areas of Laurentian granite and\r\ngneiss.\r\n\r\n“That these belts of Huronian rocks will eventually prove\r\n\r\n                     OF GREAT ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE,\r\n\r\nthere can be no doubt whatever. In Ontario the wonderful general\r\nrichness of these rocks is just beginning to be recognized, but from\r\nthem were taken in 1896 gold to the value of one hundred and twenty-one\r\nthousand dollars, nickel to the value of one million one hundred and\r\neighty-nine thousand dollars and copper to the value of three hundred\r\nand twenty thousand dollars; while in the states adjoining Lake Superior\r\nthe total production of iron ore in 1895 from these rocks was ten\r\nmillion two hundred and sixty-nine thousand long tons, valued at about\r\ntwenty million dollars. This was 62·31 per cent. of the total amount of\r\niron produced in the whole United States. The rapid progress with which\r\nthese mines are being developed is shown by the fact that the Mesabi\r\nrange was first opened up in 1892, and in 1895 the product of the mines\r\nin the range was two million eight hundred thousand tons. Thus you will\r\nsee that in these rocks there is a prospect of discovering extensive\r\ndeposits of valuable minerals.\r\n\r\n                       THE LOWER CAMBRIAN ROCKS.\r\n\r\n“But perhaps the most interesting rocks known in the Barren Lands are\r\nthose which are regarded by the Canadian Geological Survey as being of\r\nLower Cambrian age, and which are very similar in character to the\r\nNipigon or Keewenawan rocks of Lake Superior.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Survivor of Sir John Richardson’s Arctic Expedition\r\nwearing the Arctic Medal given him for that Expedition.]\r\n\r\n“In the exploration of this country recently made these rocks were first\r\nmet with about the centre of the west shore of Dubawnt lake, whence they\r\nwere found to extend north-northeastward for one hundred and twenty-five\r\nmiles to the forks of Dubawnt river. From this point they were traced\r\neastward for one hundred and seventy-five miles to the outlet of Baker\r\nlake, at which point they veered off to the south. Towards the west this\r\nseries probably extends a long distance up the valley of Thelon river,\r\nand may perhaps cross the low watershed and connect with similar beds on\r\nthe shores of Great Slave lake.\r\n\r\n“The basal portion of this series is here represented by reddish\r\nthick-bedded sandstones and conglomerates, which are comparatively\r\nunaltered and undisturbed over large areas. In some places, as on the\r\nislands near the northwest shore of Dubawnt lake, they dip regularly at\r\na moderate angle. The pebbles in the conglomerates are well rounded and\r\nwater-worn, and consist almost entirely of white clastic quartzites like\r\nthat of Marble island (Huronian) beds. The occurrence of quartzite\r\npebbles, to the almost total exclusion of pebbles of Laurentian or other\r\nrocks, would indicate that these Cambrian strata were deposited off a\r\nshore composed very largely of Huronian quartzites. The sandstones and\r\nconglomerates are cut by dykes and masses of both acid and basic\r\neruptive rocks. The acid eruptions were first met with on a hill of red\r\nquartz-porphyry at Teall point, on the west shore of Dubawnt lake. A\r\nsimilar massive quartz-porphyry forms a heavy east and west dyke, some\r\ndistance farther north on the shore of the same lake, and in the\r\nvicinity of the dyke the surrounding conglomerate is very hardened, so\r\nthat it breaks indifferently through the matrix or through the pebbles.\r\n\r\n“Towards the north end of Dubawnt lake the orthoclase in the rock is\r\nreplaced by plagioclase, the porphyry thus becoming a porphyryte. This\r\nporphyry is largely developed, and seems to underlie a large tract of\r\ncountry, along Dubawnt river between Lady Marjorie lake and the Forks,\r\nand again it was found on the island towards the east end of Baker lake.\r\n\r\n“Dark-green basic eruptions, chiefly, or perhaps exclusively, in the\r\nform of dykes, are extensively developed throughout the area covered by\r\nthe rocks of the Cambrian system. On Dubawnt lake and on Dubawnt river\r\nnear the Forks, most of these dykes\r\n\r\n                        ARE OF TYPICAL DIABASE,\r\n\r\nwith interlocking lath-shaped crystals of plagioclase, between which are\r\ncrystals, or crystalline masses of augite, often altered to chlorite.\r\n\r\n“A heavy diabase dyke, crossing Dubawnt river at Loudon rapids, cuts the\r\nsurrounding acid eruptions, and is clearly newer than they. It is also\r\ninteresting to note that the rocks in this vicinity are very freely\r\nstained with green carbonate of copper, indicating the presence of a\r\nconsiderable amount of copper disseminated through the rock, just as\r\ncopper occurs under similar conditions in similar rocks south of Lake\r\nSuperior.\r\n\r\n“Lithologically the whole of this terrain presents a remarkable\r\nresemblance to the red sandstones and quartz-porphyries of the\r\nKeewenawan (copper-bearing) rocks of Lake Superior. This resemblance is\r\nso strongly marked that small hand-specimens of the rocks from the shore\r\nof Dubawnt lake are usually indistinguishable from specimens from Lake\r\nSuperior.\r\n\r\n“Native copper was nowhere found, but it is not unlikely that it may\r\noccur in the vicinity of some of these basic dykes.”\r\n\r\nMr. Tyrrell then proceeds to discuss the deposits of native copper in\r\nthe far north as already quoted in this chapter and continues:—\r\n\r\n“Besides copper a narrow vein of pure galena has been found on the shore\r\nof Bathurst inlet.\r\n\r\n“Whether any other metals but copper and lead will be found in that\r\nregion remains to be discovered, but the evidence of the presence of\r\nAnimikie slates and limestones would indicate the possibility of the\r\noccurrence of silver, such as was found at Silver islet on Lake\r\nSuperior.\r\n\r\n“This northern country, which, as we have seen, gives abundant evidence\r\nof rich mineral wealth, has up to the present been very remote from any\r\nsettlements, but now it can actually\r\n\r\n                  BE REACHED WITH VERY LITTLE TROUBLE\r\n\r\nand expense either from Mackenzie river or from Hudson bay, and its\r\ngeneral even unmountainous character would render the building of roads\r\nacross it a matter of comparatively little difficulty.\r\n\r\n“From Mackenzie river to Great Bear lake is only sixty-five miles, and\r\nfrom that lake to Coppermine river only another sixty-five miles, while\r\nthe Keewenawan rocks on Baker lake may be reached by ocean-going\r\nsteamers which can ascend Chesterfield inlet to its head, which is open\r\nfor three months of the year. From the head of Chesterfield inlet it is\r\nonly four hundred miles, over a gently undulating country, to the east\r\nend of Great Slave lake, or five hundred and eighty miles to Copper\r\nmountains west of Coppermine river.\r\n\r\n“South of Chesterfield inlet good harbours exist, from which the\r\nHuronian rocks could readily be explored, or, if rich mines were\r\ndiscovered, would serve as means of access and outlet to and from these\r\nmines.\r\n\r\n“Churchill, at the southeastern extremity of the Barren Lands, has long\r\nbeen known as an excellent harbour, having been surveyed by Joseph\r\nRobson, an engineer, as long ago as 1746. On an average it is open five\r\nmonths of the year, from June 19, to November 18, the shortest open\r\nseason known being four months and eight days, and longest season five\r\nmonths and eighteen days.\r\n\r\n“It is true that in going to live in that northern land, one would leave\r\nfar behind the forest, meadows, and pleasant orchards of this beautiful\r\nprovince (Ontario), but the wealth torn from the rocks would enable the\r\npeople to procure all the products of more genial climates, and with the\r\nhealth and strength derived from a well-fed, but active and energetic\r\nexistence, the country would be covered with homes as happy as could be\r\nfound in any part of the world.”\r\n\r\n                         IRON, GOLD AND SILVER.\r\n\r\nMr. Tyrrell was examined before the select committee of the Senate in\r\n1907 and in his evidence upon that occasion stated that north of Lake\r\nAthabaska, for a certain distance, there are Huronian and Keewatin rocks\r\nwhich certainly contain iron and small quantities of gold and silver,\r\nbut larger quantities have not yet been discovered. Ore being a mass of\r\nmineral that can be worked at a profit, no ore has yet been found there,\r\nbut there are precious minerals. The country north of Lake Athabaska is\r\none of the most likely looking mineral countries that Mr. Tyrrell had\r\never been in. After leaving the Huronian rocks north of Lake Athabaska,\r\none then strikes through a granite country for seven hundred miles on\r\nthe routes that he travelled which does not show much evidence of\r\nminerals. Then as he got to Dubawnt lake he got on copper-bearing rocks\r\nsimilar to the copper-bearing rocks of Lake Superior, and those are\r\nundoubtedly the same copper-bearing rocks which extend across Coppermine\r\nriver, and which have there been known to produce native copper—at\r\nleast the Esquimaux bring in the copper from Coppermine river to make\r\nimplements.\r\n\r\nMr. Tyrrell said he would not expect to find silver in connection with\r\nthe copper. They do not find silver in any quantity with the copper of\r\nLake Superior. They do find silver in places, but not on the Calumet\r\npeninsula. The silver appears in a slightly different formation. While\r\nit occurs in rocks of somewhat similar age, still it is not immediately\r\nassociated with copper, and the rocks that one finds from Dubawnt lake\r\nnorthward, covering quite a large area, are very similar to the\r\ncopper-bearing rocks on Lake Superior. Taking a set of specimens from\r\nthe copper-bearing rocks of Lake Superior, Mr. Tyrrell declared he could\r\nduplicate them almost exactly from a set of specimens from these\r\nnorthern rocks in all the peculiar minerals—and there are a great many\r\nof them. He saw a small amount of copper in many places in these rocks,\r\nand we know that it occurs in the rock, because the Esquimaux pick up\r\nnative copper and make their implements from it. So that he looked for a\r\nlarge development at some time of a copper industry in that country\r\nbetween Chesterfield inlet and Coppermine river. He had never been at\r\nCoppermine river himself. Really the principal exploration of Coppermine\r\nriver, he explained, was done nearly one hundred years ago, and there\r\nhas been very little exploration of it since. It was visited by Doctor\r\nJ. M. Bell some three or four years previous to 1907, but he just barely\r\ntouched it, and Sir John Richardson, in the early part of last century,\r\nreally furnished all the information that is known about Coppermine\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n                    A LARGE AREA OF MINERAL COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nIn the far northern region, Mr. Tyrrell stated upon this occasion, there\r\nis a large area of mineral bearing country. As you come out to the mouth\r\nof Chesterfield inlet there is an area of Keewatin and Huronian rocks,\r\nsimilar to the conglomerates of northern Ontario, which have been found\r\nto be so rich there, and these rocks are known to contain a certain\r\namount of gold and copper. Mr. Tyrrell saw them himself there, and he\r\nhad, he said, every confidence that that area too will produce minerals\r\nof value—workable ores. There was no indication of nickel in any part\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nMr. A. P. Low, of the Geological Survey of Canada, who was a witness\r\nbefore the same committee, stated that he had spent one winter at Cape\r\nFullerton, north of Chesterfield inlet. He explained that on the\r\nmainland where there are marked indentations, there is a large\r\ndevelopment of Huronian rocks, which contain four per cent. of copper\r\npyrites. These rocks have not been properly prospected yet, and there\r\nhave been no claims taken up on them. They have not been proven in any\r\nway. Between Chesterfield and Fullerton there are several fairly decent\r\ndeposits of iron pyrites, and some of these contain small deposits of\r\ngold. Gold was found by Doctor Wright somewhere in Whitcher inlet, but\r\nbeyond those discoveries nothing of a definite character is known of the\r\nminerals of the far north.\r\n\r\nThe island of Southampton east of Fullerton is formed of limestone, and\r\na band of ancient Huronian Laurentian rocks, which crosses at the north\r\nside of it.\r\n\r\n                    FREE GOLD IN MELVILLE PENINSULA.\r\n\r\nExamined before the select committee of the Senate in 1887, Doctor Robt.\r\nBell of the Geological Survey stated that free gold had at that date\r\nbeen found in quartz in Repulse bay, south of Melville peninsula, which\r\nis the extreme northeastern point of the continent, and considerably\r\nnorth of Fullerton. The free gold he spoke of as coming from Repulse bay\r\nwas noticed by Professor James Tennant, of King’s College, London,\r\nEngland. Plenty of copper had been found up there. Witness had found it\r\nin small quantities himself, and it had been found as occurring in large\r\nquantities among specimens brought from the west coast of Hudson bay by\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of his voyage by sea to Hudson bay, Doctor Bell said he had not\r\nhad an opportunity to satisfactorily investigate the mineral resources\r\nof the country. His own opportunities for discovery had been limited on\r\naccount of the fact that when he was at the most likely places for\r\nfinding gold or silver he had very little chance to get ashore. He had\r\nto take just what opportunity he had when going ashore with boats for\r\nballast or to land materials at the stations. The main object of all the\r\nexpeditions was to establish and supply the stations. If he had had an\r\nexpedition under his own control, fitted out for that object, he had no\r\ndoubt he could make valuable discoveries of minerals. He saw some quartz\r\nledges himself. They varied in size. He could not look entirely for\r\neconomic minerals, for in the few hours he had at any place he had to\r\nascertain as much as possible of the geological structure of the\r\ncountry, and incidentally, if he found anything worthy of notice, he\r\nbrought away specimens. He saw many large veins of quartz, but those\r\nfrom which he brought the specimens which happened to contain gold and\r\nsilver were not so large as others he had seen. Some were several feet\r\nwide. He did not find visible gold at all.\r\n\r\nAs to the gold prospects in the central part of the Barren Lands,\r\nInspector Pelletier, Royal Northwest Mounted Police, states in his\r\nreport:—“In many places along the Thelon, great sand bars are\r\nprominent, creeks flowing into it do so over gravel beds and when this\r\ncountry is prospected I expect to hear of placer gold discoveries. It is\r\na good country for prospectors. A prospecting outfit going there would\r\nfind plenty of good timber to build their camp, and any amount of fuel.\r\nThey would have to carry only certain kinds of provisions, for fish is\r\nabundant. Musk-ox and deer at certain times of the year are very\r\nnumerous.”\r\n\r\n                         LIGNITE AND SOFT COAL.\r\n\r\nLarge areas of lignite and soft coal have been discovered along the\r\nshores of Arctic sea between the Mackenzie and the Coppermine and in the\r\nislands off the coast.\r\n\r\nDoctor Richardson in 1826 found the Arctic coast east of Cape Bathurst\r\nto consist of precipitous banks, similar in structure to the bituminous\r\nshale cliffs at Whitby in Yorkshire. This shale was in a state of\r\nignition in many places.\r\n\r\nAccording to the same authority “carboniferous limestone exists on the\r\nnorthwestern coast of Banks island, on Melville and Bathurst islands. At\r\nVillage point, in latitude 76° 40′ and longitude 97° west, at Depot\r\npoint, Grinnell land (of Belcher), latitude 77° 5′ north, and at various\r\nother places in the carboniferous limestone tract there are coal beds.\r\nThese coal beds are considered by Professor Houghton to be very low down\r\nin the carboniferous series.”\r\n\r\nIn a valley in Banks island some distance from the coast and three\r\nhundred feet above sea level, Richardson relates that Captain McClure\r\nand Doctor Armstrong visited a carboniferous deposit. “The ends of\r\ntrunks and branches of trees,” says the last-named officer, “were seen\r\nprotruding through the rich loamy soil in which they were imbedded. On\r\nexcavating to some extent we found the entire hill to be a ligneous\r\nformation, being composed of the trunks and branches of trees, some of\r\nthem dark and softened, in a state of semi-carbonization.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE BARREN LANDS, OR “ARCTIC PRAIRIE.”\r\n\r\n                  Game, Fur-bearing Animals and Fish.\r\n\r\n   Where Millions of Caribou Roam at Large.—Actual Value of These\r\n     Immense Herds Very Great.—Can they Become Domesticated or\r\n     Replaced by the Lapland Reindeer?—The Home of the Musk-Ox and\r\n     Many Fur-Bearing Animals.—The Polar Bear.—Where the Wild Geese\r\n     Nest.—Lakes, Rivers and Sea Coasts Teeming With Fish.—The\r\n     Arctic Salmon, Trout, White Fish and Grayling.\r\n\r\nThe fish and game resources of the Barren Lands have hitherto been the\r\nsole support of the small human population, and unquestionably they\r\ncould support an infinitely larger number of people than have hitherto\r\nresided in the far northern wilderness. As every explorer of the region\r\nfrom Hearne until the present date has had to depend primarily\r\npractically wholly upon fish and game for sustenance while in the\r\ninterior, we know much more about the resources of the country in those\r\nrespects than any of the others. The occurrence of fish and game has\r\nbeen a matter of life or death to the explorers, and naturally they have\r\nall dwelt upon the matter in the narratives of their trips. That so many\r\nadventurous and lengthy trips through the country have succeeded\r\ntestifies to the abundance of fish and game even in the far north of\r\nthis vast region.\r\n\r\nThe chief source of the food supply of the natives and of explorers in\r\nthe Barren Lands is the Barren Lands caribou, _Rangifer arcticus_\r\n(Richardson). Mr. E. A. Preble of the United States Biological Survey,\r\nin his report so often quoted in the preceding pages, says:—“This\r\nfamous animal, usually in the north called ‘deer,’ and often mentioned\r\nin the narratives of Arctic travel, occurs more or less abundantly on\r\nthe barren grounds of the region treated of, and on the large islands to\r\nthe northward. It is the caribou, more than any other animal, which\r\nrenders human residence in this desolate region possible.\r\n\r\n“Within this great area it is probable that there are two or more races,\r\nperhaps distinct species, since the animals are separated by the\r\nphysiographic conditions of the country into different herds, or\r\naggregations of herds, which never associate with each other at any time\r\nof the year, and which have somewhat different habits. A series of skins\r\nand skulls will be necessary to a decision as to the number of\r\nrecognizable forms. For the present, however, all the caribou of this\r\nregion, excepting the woodland species, may without violence be\r\n\r\n                       CONSIDERED AS ONE SPECIES,\r\n\r\nfor which the name _arcticus_, applied by Richardson to the animal\r\ninhabiting the main area of the Barren Grounds between Great Bear lake\r\nand Hudson bay, may be used. It is reasonably certain that within this\r\nlatter area but one species is represented.”\r\n\r\nOne of the recent explorers, Mr. J. B. Tyrrell, and his brother, Mr. J.\r\nW. Tyrrell, give us perhaps the most complete first-hand information as\r\nto the caribou. In notes of the fauna of the country lying between the\r\neastern part of Athabaska lake and Churchill river, explored in the\r\nsummer of 1892, J. B. Tyrrell says:—“The Barren Grounds\r\ncaribou. . . . . . comes south in winter to the south end of Reindeer\r\nlake and the upper portion of Mudjatik and Foster rivers. It travels\r\nnorth in spring to the Barren Grounds, but a very few animals are\r\noccasionally left behind, one having been shot in July near the north\r\nend of Cree lake.”\r\n\r\nFort Fond du Lac (east end of Lake Athabaska) is stated by Mr. Tyrrell\r\nin the same report to be “on one of the principal lines of travel of the\r\nBarren Ground caribou, in their regular migrations north and south.”\r\n\r\nIn the report of his expedition down the Dubawnt valley and Chesterfield\r\ninlet in 1893, Mr. Tyrrell mentions that his party first saw caribou (he\r\ncalls them _Rangifer Grœnlandicus_) on July 28 on Barlow lake, “and on\r\nJuly 29, we met a vast herd of Barren Ground caribou collected on a good\r\nfeeding ground on the eastern shore of Carey lake.”\r\n\r\nMr. Tyrrell gives the following details:—“Four miles below Barlow lake,\r\nthe river Dubawnt enters the south end of Carey lake, so called in\r\nhonour of the Reverend Doctor Carey of St. John, N.B. After paddling up\r\nthe lake for five miles, directing our course towards a high point with\r\na large boulder on its summit, afterwards called Cairn point, we saw\r\n\r\n                       AN IMMENSE HERD OF CARIBOU\r\n\r\n(_Rangifer Grœnlandicus_) moving along the east shore. We at once\r\npaddled towards the land, and found the deer standing on low wet grassy\r\nland near the water, at the foot of a long stony slope.\r\n\r\n“The following extract from my daily journal, with the photographs in\r\nthe front of the report, will give a fairly clear idea of the number of\r\ndeer seen:—\r\n\r\n“July 30.—Yesterday was the first clear warm day that we have had for a\r\nlong time, but to day is also clear and warm, with a gentle breeze\r\nblowing from the west. We spent the day skinning and cutting up the\r\nfattest of the bucks we killed yesterday. Our camp is a hundred yards\r\nfrom the lake, near the edge of a bog, with a scattered grove of larch\r\nand black spruce just behind us. All day the caribou have been around us\r\nin vast numbers, many thousands being collected together in single\r\nherds. One herd collected in the hill behind our camp, and another\r\nremained for hours in the wet bog on the point in front of us. The\r\nlittle fawns were running about everywhere, often coming up to within a\r\nyard or two of us, uttering their sharp grunts as they stood and looked\r\nup at us, or as they turned and ran back to the does. About noon a large\r\nherd had collected on the sides and summit of the hill behind us. Taking\r\nthe small hand camera with which we were supplied, we walked quietly\r\namong them. As we approached to within a few yards of the dense herd, it\r\nopened to let us in, and then formed a circle round us, so that we were\r\nable to stand for a couple of hours and watch the deer as they stood in\r\nthe light breeze or rubbed slowly past each other to keep off the black\r\nflies. The bucks, with their beautiful branching antlers, kept well in\r\nthe background. We obtained a number of photographs, which show the\r\nanimals in many positions; later in the afternoon a herd of bucks\r\ntrotted up to us, and stood at about forty yards distance. This was a\r\nmost beautiful sight, for their horns are now full grown, though still\r\nsoft at the tips, but unfortunately we had not the camera with us. We\r\ndid not shoot any to-day.”\r\n\r\nIn his paper before the British Association in 1897 Mr. Tyrrell said\r\nthat this herd at Carey lake must have contained between one and\r\n\r\n                 TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND HEAD OF CARIBOU.\r\n\r\nThey were migrating southward towards the edge of the woods, where they\r\nwould spend the winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Indian Dance Lodge.]\r\n\r\nMr. J. W. Tyrrell, who was with his brother upon this occasion, in his\r\nbook “Through the Sub-Arctics of Canada”, speaks of the caribou seen at\r\nCarey lake as forming “many great bands literally covering the country\r\nover wide areas. The valleys and hillsides for miles appeared to be\r\nmoving masses of caribou. To estimate their numbers would be impossible.\r\nThey could only be reckoned in acres or square miles. We walked to and\r\nfro through the herd of caribou, causing little more alarm than one\r\nwould by walking through a herd of cattle in the field.”\r\n\r\nNear the head of Dubawnt lake the Tyrrells, in August, noticed scattered\r\nbands of deer, also two or three wolves and a wolverine.\r\n\r\nIn 1894, when Mr. J. B. Tyrrell’s party was descending Kazan river, they\r\nfirst fell in with the Barren Lands caribou on the west side of Ennadai\r\nlake about latitude 61°, on August 14. Mr. Tyrrell in his report says\r\nthe deer were travelling southward in large numbers. The country was\r\nopen and treeless, and the deer were rather difficult to approach, but\r\ntwelve were shot and cut up, and their meat was spread out to dry in the\r\nsun and wind.”\r\n\r\nMr. J. W. Tyrrell mentions seeing some caribou and many signs of them\r\nduring his exploration of Hanbury and Thelon rivers in 1900. “While\r\ndescending Hanbury river, to the eastward of Great Slave lake, during\r\nthe early part of July, only an occasional straggling caribou was met.\r\nOn July 23, however, on the Thelon, he observed a large band moving\r\nsouthward. In his report Mr. Tyrrell states:—“The Thelon was evidently\r\nfrequented on both sides by numbers of caribou, as their tracks were\r\neverywhere to be seen, though few of the deer were met with, until the\r\nlower stretches of the river were reached, their migration having\r\npreceded us.”\r\n\r\nBack relates that on July 15, 1834, while his party was descending Backs\r\nriver, at Beechey lake the swampy prairies, “which near the cascades\r\nmight be called plains,” were “all thickly inhabited by deer.” Back\r\ncalls the caribou “_Cervus tarandus_” (Linn).\r\n\r\nMr. David T. Hanbury found large bands of caribou, comprising adults of\r\nboth sexes and their young, proceeding southward along Hanbury river\r\nabout the last of July.\r\n\r\n                       MIGRATION OF THE CARIBOU.\r\n\r\nWriting of the migratory habits of the caribou, Mr. Hanbury\r\nstates:—“There is no doubt that caribou migrate. They go south in large\r\nherds in autumn, and north in spring. They cross the country east of\r\nGreat Slave lake, round Artillery lake, and some distance east of it.\r\nThey do not appear on the main Ark-i-linik river, but between Aberdeen\r\nand Schultz lakes they pass with some regularity. The migration takes\r\nplace on such a large scale, and over such a wide tract of country, that\r\nit has been assumed that all caribou migrate; the fact seems to be that\r\nthe majority of animals remain in the north throughout the year. I have\r\nmyself shot caribou in winter along the west coast of Hudson bay, and\r\ninland from the bay; along the north and south coasts of Chesterfield\r\ninlet; in the country north of the head of the inlet as far as Garry\r\nlake on Backs river, and along Backs river. I have also killed them to\r\nthe north and south of Baker, Aberdeen and Schultz lakes in winter, and\r\nI know others who have killed them in winter in the country about Wager\r\nriver and Repulse bay. On the Arctic coast, at White Bear point, and on\r\nKent peninsula, and at other places which will be mentioned later,\r\ncaribou are always to be found during the winter. Thus, I think it may\r\nbe held as proved that very great numbers of caribou do not migrate.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hanbury, in another part of his book, mentions that on October 26,\r\n1901, he hunted caribou near Baker lake, west of Chesterfield inlet. He\r\nwrites:—“On looking out I could see deer in thousands away to the west.\r\nThey seemed like small black stones in the distance, but with the glass\r\ntheir movements could be distinctly seen.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hanbury announces that he was informed by the Eskimo of Ogden bay\r\nthat caribou are found on Kent peninsula, at Cape Barrow, and near the\r\ncoast of Victoria Land, throughout the winter, but that none remained\r\nduring that season between Cape Barrow and the Coppermine or near Ogden\r\nbay.\r\n\r\nMr. Warburton Pike (See p. 19) in his book “The Barren Grounds of\r\nNorthern Canada” makes frequent and interesting references to the\r\ncaribou. He mentions that during his journey northward into the Barren\r\nGrounds from the eastern part of Great Slave lake, in the autumn of\r\n1889, caribou were first met with on Lake Camsell, about seventy miles\r\nnorth of Great Slave lake, on September 15. The animals were then on\r\ntheir way south, and many were seen during the remainder of September as\r\nthe party travelled northward.\r\n\r\n                      DESCRIPTION OF A MIGRATION.\r\n\r\nMr. Pike encamped for the winter on the south shore of Mackay lake and\r\nwhile there witnessed the migration southward, which he thus\r\ndescribes:—“Scattered bands of caribou were almost always in sight from\r\nthe top of the ridge behind the camp, and increased in numbers until the\r\nmorning of October 20, when little Baptiste, who had gone for firewood,\r\nwoke us up before daylight with the cry of ‘La Foule! La Foule!’ and\r\neven on the ledge we could hear the curious clatter made by a band of\r\ntravelling caribou. La Foule had really come and during its passage of\r\nsix days I was able to realize what an extraordinary number of these\r\nanimals still roam in the Barren Ground. From the ridge we had a\r\nsplendid view of the migration; all the south side of Mackay lake was\r\nalive with moving beasts, while the ice seemed to be dotted all over\r\nwith black islands, and still away on the north shore, with the aid of\r\nthe glasses, we could see them coming like regiments on the march. In\r\nevery direction we could hear the grunting noise that the caribou always\r\nmake when travelling; the snow was broken into broad roads, and I found\r\nit useless to try to estimate the number that passed within a few miles\r\nof our encampment. We were just on the western edge of their passage,\r\nand afterwards heard that a band of Dogribs, hunting some forty miles to\r\nthe west, were at this very time in the last straits of starvation, only\r\nsaving their lives by a hasty retreat into the woods, where they were\r\nlucky enough to kill sufficient meat to stave off disaster. . . . . The\r\ncaribou, as is usually the case when they are in large numbers, were\r\nvery tame, and on several occasions I found myself right in the middle\r\nof a band with a splendid chance to pick out any that seemed in good\r\ncondition. . . . . This passage of the caribou is the most remarkable\r\nthing that I have ever seen in the course of many expeditions among the\r\nbig game of America. The buffalo were for the most part killed out\r\nbefore my time, but, notwithstanding all the tall stories that are told\r\nof their numbers, I cannot believe that the herds on the prairie ever\r\nsurpassed in size ‘La Foule’ of the caribou.”\r\n\r\n                        NO DANGER OF STARVATION.\r\n\r\nOn his way north, the following spring, Mr. Pike first fell in with the\r\ncaribou in June. In his book, “The Barren Grounds of Northern Canada”,\r\nreferring to this event, Mr. Pike states:—“From this time, all through\r\nthe summer, till we again reached Great Slave lake late in August, we\r\nhad no difficulty about provisions; although there was many a time when\r\nwe could not say where we might find our next meal, something always\r\nturned up, and we were never a single day without eating during the\r\nwhole day. I really believe it is a mistake to try to carry enough food\r\nfor a summer’s work in the Barren Grounds, as the difficulty of\r\ntransport is so great, and after the caribou are once found there is no\r\ndanger of starvation.\r\n\r\n“We were now travelling with the bull caribou, which had just left the\r\nthick woods, and made easy marches from lake to lake in a northeast\r\ndirection; the weather became cold again for the last time, and June 7\r\nwas like a bad winter’s day with a strong north wind and snowstorms.\r\nThen the summer came suddenly, and on June 11 we were obliged to camp on\r\na high gravel ridge to await _le grand dégel_, which rendered travelling\r\nimpossible, till the deep water had run off the ice.”\r\n\r\nWhen descending Lockhart river on his way from Artillery lake to Great\r\nSlave lake, on his way back to civilization, Mr. Pike remarked “caribou\r\nwalking the ridges and swimming the lakes in every direction.”\r\n\r\n                    A MIGRATION NEAR ARTILLERY LAKE.\r\n\r\nInspector Pelletier, Royal Northwest Mounted Police, in the report of\r\nhis patrol from Great Slave lake to Hudson bay, makes special reference\r\nto the numbers of caribou, then migrating southward, seen during the\r\npassage of his party from the eastern end of Great Slave lake, to Thelon\r\nriver. He writes:—“As we were approaching the portage from Burr to\r\nToura lake we sighted a large herd of deer coming out behind the grove\r\nof trees. This was the first we had seen. They were mostly does, but a\r\nfew young bulls were scattered amongst them. We killed a small one which\r\nproved a great addition to our larder. They were not much frightened by\r\nus although they kept at a distance. They were in sight all the while we\r\nwere portaging. From Burr lake to Artillery lake we were practically\r\nsurrounded by deer. We camped for the night of July 21 at the fifteen\r\nyards portage north of Toura lake and during the night deer kept passing\r\nto and fro close to our tents in large numbers. On July 22 near the foot\r\nof Artillery lake we saw thousands and thousands of deer, mostly bulls,\r\ncoming over the ridge behind our camp, making for the water and crossing\r\nwhere it was no more than half a mile wide. Gradually the ridges on each\r\nshore and the traverse itself were alive with them. It was a wonderful\r\nsight seen late at night.\r\n\r\n“At the south end of Artillery lake countless deer were seen; the bucks\r\nand does seemed to belong to separate herds. They were crossing and\r\nrecrossing at that point where the lake is quite narrow, ranging from a\r\nquarter mile to one and a half miles in width. For a distance of about\r\ntwo or three miles the hills were covered with them and the water was\r\nbridged in two or three different places at a time. This might appear to\r\nbe exaggerated; I would never have believed there were so many deer in\r\nthe north, only now that I have seen them, I must. The natives we met at\r\nthat place told us what we had seen was not the main herd but part of\r\nit, that the main body was a few miles up the lake on the west shore;\r\nthey had just been there in their canoes the previous day. If what we\r\nhad seen was not the main herd I wondered how large the main herd could\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n                       CARIBOU ALONG THE THELON.\r\n\r\n“Deer were seen in good numbers along Sifton lake, near Timber rapids,\r\nand at Timber rapids; they also were sighted in other places. At the\r\nhigh sand ridge, about twelve miles below Sifton lake, a large herd was\r\nfeeding on an island. At the lower end of Timber rapids the stream\r\nscatters and gets shallow, full of boulders, and while winding around\r\nlittle channels a herd of deer was crossing, we could not possibly stop\r\nwithout getting into some mix up. Luckily the deer sighted us and heard\r\nus (we were making all the noise we could to frighten them). They rushed\r\nthrough, leaving our little channel open. We could have touched them\r\nwith the paddle, they were so near. We grazed one rock, and that was due\r\nto our attention being diverted by the deer.\r\n\r\n“No game was seen on the Hanbury but a deer or two at the upper end.\r\nInnumerable paths beaten by them were very distinct all the way, but we\r\nsaw no fresh tracks denoting recent passage.”\r\n\r\nWriting of Thelon river itself, the Inspector states in his report:—“At\r\nthe lower end deer are very numerous at certain times of the year. At\r\ntheir favourite traverses or crossings the ground is netted with deep,\r\nwell-defined deer trails. We saw only one deer on the whole of the\r\nThelon. I am told by natives that deer in the fall and spring are seen\r\nby the thousands on their migrations north and south.”\r\n\r\n                      WEST OF CHESTERFIELD INLET.\r\n\r\nAs to the series of lakes through which the waters of the Thelon and\r\nDubawnt are discharged into Chesterfield inlet, Inspector Pelletier\r\nreports:—“From Beverly lake down to Hudson bay deer were met almost\r\ndaily, but not in large herds. Most were seen along the lower end of\r\nSchultz lake, Schultz river rapids and along Baker lake. At Beverly lake\r\nwe met a camp of Eskimos, a few men and women. They were well provided\r\nwith everything in the line of arms, ammunition, clothing and\r\nnecessaries of life. At the foot of Baker lake is another camp of\r\nnatives, numbering about twenty-five. They were well stocked with\r\neverything, killing a good number of deer, and laying in a stock of meat\r\nand deerskin for the winter.”\r\n\r\nA few notes from journals or reports of other travellers as to the\r\ndistribution and migration of this remarkable animal are instructive.\r\nDuring Anderson and Stewart’s journey down Backs river in the summer of\r\n1855 caribou were found to be numerous about Clinton-Colden and Aylmer\r\nlakes, and the species was observed on Adelaide peninsula in the far\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nIn the summer and autumn of 1879 the party of Frederick Schwatka,\r\nsearching for relics of Sir John Franklin, found large numbers of\r\ncaribou on King William island and on the lower part of Backs river.\r\n\r\n                       FOURTEEN DAYS IN PASSING.\r\n\r\nFrank Russell, who passed the winter of 1893-94 at Fort Rae on the north\r\narm of Great Slave lake, says, concerning the Barren Ground caribou:—“A\r\nfew years ago they were often killed from the buildings and throughout\r\nthe winter might be found near the post. In 1877 an unbroken line of\r\ncaribou crossed the frozen lake near the fort. They were fourteen days\r\nin passing and in such a mass that in the words of an eye witness\r\n‘daylight could not be seen through the column’. They were now seldom\r\nseen within several miles of Rae.” During the winter he spent there only\r\none small band crossed the lake towards the west.\r\n\r\nMr. W. J. McLean states that in 1899 the caribou arrived in the\r\nneighbourhood of old Fort Reliance, at the extreme east end of Great\r\nSlave lake, on August 12.\r\n\r\nDoctor J. M. Bell states that on his trip eastward along the north shore\r\nof Great Bear lake, in 1900, he first met with caribou sixty miles west\r\nof Fort Confidence late in July, and later found them fairly numerous\r\nbetween Fort Confidence and the lower Coppermine.\r\n\r\n                      ACTUAL VALUE OF THE CARIBOU.\r\n\r\nAs to the actual value of the caribou to the country, Mr. J. B. Tyrrell\r\nstated in his paper before the British Association:—“Their flesh is\r\nexcellent eating, and the animals will doubtless furnish an important\r\nfood-supply for explorers and pioneers in that country. Whether they can\r\nbe tamed, and thus brought permanently into the service of man or\r\nwhether they must disappear like most of the other denizens of the\r\nwilderness, remains to be seen; but even if they should be doomed to\r\ndisappear, it seems quite possible that they might be replaced by tame\r\nreindeer from Lapland who would feed in summer on the vast grassy\r\nplains, and in winter would take kindly to a diet of Canadian lichens.”\r\n\r\nMr. J. W. Tyrrell considers the Barren Ground caribou “is the same as\r\nthe reindeer of Lapland.” He states in his book “Through the Sub-Arctics\r\nof Canada”:—“As a source of venison it cannot be excelled, especially\r\nin the autumn season, when it is in prime condition. During September\r\nand October the males are rolling fat, and as food their flesh is then\r\nequal to the finest beef. Of all the meats I have ever tasted certainly\r\nreindeer tongues takes the first place for daintiness and delicacy of\r\nflavour.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Back, writing in 1835, stated of the reindeer or caribou:—“It\r\nfurnishes food and clothing to the Dogrib and Copper Indians, the\r\nChipewyans, the Swamp or Coast Crees, and to the Esquimaux, but none of\r\nthe American tribes have domesticated it like the Laplanders. Every part\r\nof the animal is eaten, even to the contents of its stomach, and the\r\nhalf-dried tongue when roasted is perhaps the greatest delicacy that the\r\nfur countries afford. Reindeer meat, when in the best condition, is not\r\nonly superior to that of the moose deer and bison, but, in my opinion,\r\nit surpasses the best mutton or English-fed venison.”\r\n\r\nMr. Ernest Thompson Seton, lecturing on his trip to the Barren Lands in\r\n1906, stated while in the region of perpetual day or night, his party\r\nhad a caribou at hand whenever they wanted one for a meal. When they\r\npitched tents near trail, the shaggy animals loped along during the\r\nnight and tripped over the guy-ropes.\r\n\r\n“Cutting in half the estimates of explorers who went before me, and\r\nmaking a most conservative estimate there are not less than\r\n\r\n                    THIRTY MILLIONS OF THESE CARIBOU\r\n\r\nletting the wind blow through their whiskers in that northern country,”\r\nsaid the lecturer. “There is absolutely no destructive war on them, and\r\nno possibility of their destruction. When the great northland is opened\r\nup, it will be for Canadians to decide what is to be done with those\r\nanimals, and how is that beautiful country to be opened up? Some say\r\nthat the reindeer will be the medium, but I hold that it will be the\r\nyak, which roams through the north of China. This animal is strong and\r\nsturdy, can bear the heaviest burdens, and can stand any extreme of\r\nclimate.”\r\n\r\n                       THE EXPERIMENT IN ALASKA.\r\n\r\nIn view of the suggestions that have been made as to the domestication\r\nof the Barren Lands caribou, and recalling the fact that through the\r\nagency of Doctor Grenfell of Labrador, Lapland reindeer have been\r\nrecently (1912) sent out to the Athabaska region as an experiment, the\r\nfollowing paragraph from the “Christian Herald” of a recent date is\r\ninteresting: “It is only a few years since the United States Government,\r\nas an experiment which it was hoped would help the Eskimos and Indians\r\nof northern Alaska, imported a few score reindeer from Norway, with a\r\nnumber of Lapps skilled in their care. Subsequently other reindeer were\r\nbrought from the opposite coast of Asia, and although it was known that\r\nthe particular form of moss or lichen on which these animals live, and\r\nwhich flourishes under the snow, was abundant within the American Arctic\r\ncircle, the attempt to introduce reindeer was regarded by a majority of\r\nour citizens as being quite as wild and visionary as was the purchase of\r\nAlaska by Secretary Seward in 1867.\r\n\r\n“The few score reindeer have grown to twenty-seven thousand three\r\nhundred and twenty five distributed in forty-two herds. More than\r\none-half, or fourteen thousand nine hundred and ninety-three, is owned\r\nby natives who before the advent of the reindeer were in a state of the\r\nmost wretched poverty. Of the remainder three thousand seven hundred and\r\nthirty are owned by the United States, four thousand one hundred and\r\nninety-four by missions and four thousand four hundred and seven by\r\nLapps. The total income of the Eskimos from the reindeer industry during\r\nthe last year reported was twenty-four thousand six hundred and\r\nthirty-six dollars.”\r\n\r\n               FUTURE SUPPLY OF CHEESE, MEAT AND LEATHER.\r\n\r\nA newspaper despatch is authority for the statements that the first\r\nshipment of reindeer meat has been shipped from Alaska to Seattle, and\r\nthat the gentleman in charge of the reindeer in Alaska for the United\r\nStates government says that in a quarter of a century there will be\r\nthree million beef reindeer in Alaska, and that they will thrive and\r\nmultiply and fatten on the Arctic vegetation where even a goat could not\r\nlive. Their flesh, he asserts, is more palatable than either beef or\r\nmutton.\r\n\r\nIn view of the success of this experiment in Alaska it is predicted that\r\nin the far north of America, as in the far north of Europe, the reindeer\r\nwill be the principal domestic animal, supplying the people not only of\r\nthe northland itself, but of more southerly latitudes, with cheese, and\r\nmeat, and leather.\r\n\r\n                              THE MUSK-OX.\r\n\r\nMr. J. B. Tyrrell is authority for the statement that besides the\r\ncaribou, musk-oxen (_Ovibos moschatus_) are the only other large\r\nherbivorous animals that live in the open plains of the north, and they\r\nscorn the shelter of the forest even in winter, their long shaggy coat\r\nof hair furnishing sufficient protection against the severest gales. Mr.\r\nTyrrell in his report of his explorations along Dubawnt and Kazan rivers\r\nstates that the habitat of the musk-ox seems to be confined to that\r\ncountry north of the portion of Dubawnt river between Dubawnt lake and\r\nHudson bay. None were seen in the course of either of the two\r\nexpeditions mentioned, but Eskimos met with at the head of Chesterfield\r\ninlet had a number of fresh skins. The Eskimos on Kazan river reported\r\nto Mr. Tyrrell that there were no musk-oxen in their neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nMr. E. A. Preble states in his report:—“This famous ruminant within\r\nhistoric times ranged over the entire extent of the Barren Grounds, from\r\nthe mouth of the Mackenzie to Churchill. It has now become extirpated\r\nover large areas at the eastern and western extremities of this range,\r\nbut still exists in great numbers in the less accessible parts of its\r\nhabitat.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Back records on July 13, 1834, while descending the river which\r\nnow bears his name, he noticed two or three hundred deer, and, apart\r\nfrom them, herds of musk-oxen were either grazing or sleeping on its\r\nwestern banks, which there (above Beechey lake) looked green and swampy,\r\nand were all more or less cloven by inconsiderable ravines, with a\r\nclayey surface. Back mentions that his party killed a musk-ox on\r\nMontreal island, off the mouth of Backs river, August 3, 1834. While\r\nascending that river on his return trip, on September 1, Back near Lake\r\nPelly noticed a herd of musk-oxen and a few straggling deer quietly\r\nfeeding on the sand-hills, “and many of the white, brown, and laughing\r\ngeese were flying about, and seemed to be collecting for their southerly\r\nmigration.”\r\n\r\n                        THE MEAT OF THE MUSK-OX.\r\n\r\nBack states that the musk-ox “feeds, like the reindeer, chiefly on\r\nlichens, and the meat of a well-fed cow is agreeably tasty and juicy,\r\nbut that of a lean cow and of the bull is strongly impregnated with a\r\ndisagreeable musky flavour, so as to be palatable only to a very hungry\r\nman.”\r\n\r\nIn his evidence before the select committee of the Senate in 1888, Hon.\r\nWilliam Christie, formerly Inspecting Chief Factor of the Hudson’s Bay\r\nCompany, stated that the company at that time got a few—a very\r\nfew—musk-ox hides at Churchill and Fort Rae. This animal kept pretty\r\nwell in the open country along the Arctic coast. Witness was four years\r\nat Churchill, and was asked by a friend to get a musk-ox robe for him,\r\nand was two or three years before he obtained it.\r\n\r\nHon. Frank Oliver informed the same committee that Mr. Murdoch McLeod, a\r\nretired Hudson’s Bay Company’s official, told him that a musk-ox bull\r\nwhich he helped to kill weighed fourteen hundred pounds, dressed, and\r\nthe robe measured fifteen feet from nose to rump. The musk-oxen were\r\nfound generally in bands of ten to forty. Some winters they were more\r\nscarce than others, which could not be explained.\r\n\r\nMr. D. T. Hanbury, writing of the original exploration by him of Thelon\r\nand Hanbury rivers, states:—“After ascending the main Ark-i-linik\r\n(Thelon) river for about thirty-five miles, musk-ox tracks commenced to\r\nget very numerous. The muddy shores in places were so ploughed up with\r\ntheir tracks as to give the idea that a drove of cattle had passed\r\nalong.” In this vicinity the explorer saw several herds of musk-oxen.\r\n\r\n                          A MUSK-OX PRESERVE.\r\n\r\nIn another place in his book “Sport and Travel in the Northland of\r\nCanada”, Mr. Hanbury writes:—“On the main Ark-i-linik (Thelon) river\r\nthere is a stretch of country about eighty miles in length into which no\r\nhuman being enters. The Eskimos do not hunt so far west, and Yellow\r\nKnives and Dog Ribs from Slave lake do not go so far east. To penetrate\r\nthis country in the dead of winter would be simply to court starvation.\r\nThen the deer have all departed, and to depend on finding musk-oxen at\r\nthe end of the journey would be risky indeed. Thus there remains the\r\nspot in this Great Barren Northland which is sacred to the musk-ox. Here\r\nthe animals remain in their primeval state, exhibiting no fear, only\r\ncuriosity. I approached several herds within thirty yards, photographed\r\nthem at my leisure, moving them round as I wished, and then retired,\r\nleaving them still stupidly staring at me as if in wonder. When the deer\r\nwere not procurable a musk-ox was killed. The height of a large bull\r\nwhich I killed in 1896 at a spot about fifty miles farther north was\r\nfifty-five inches; horns twenty-seven inches.”\r\n\r\n                        A MIDNIGHT MUSK-OX HUNT.\r\n\r\nIn the official report of his exploratory trip from Great Slave lake to\r\nChesterfield inlet via Thelon river in 1900 Mr. J. W. Tyrrell states\r\nthat his party first encountered musk-oxen among the lakes in the\r\nvicinity of the height of land between the basin of Great Slave lake,\r\nand that of the Thelon. He thus refers to this event:—“Whilst sailing\r\nnorthward into Sifton lake we encountered a gale, which drove us ashore\r\nat the focus of the four arms. Thus finding a little leisure time thrust\r\nupon us, Mr. Fairchild and I, providing ourselves with compasses and\r\nfield glasses, made an exploratory tramp of a few miles. The season had\r\nnow advanced to June 27, and at such time in our latitude (63° 44′), we\r\nhad no darkness, although the sun dipped below the horizon for a short\r\ntime. The hours of night were, therefore, as suitable for travel as\r\nthose of day, and hence it was ten p.m. when, scanning the valleys and\r\nhillsides with my powerful stereoscopic field glasses, I observed a band\r\nof musk-oxen feeding a mile or two to the northward. Fifteen of them\r\nwere counted in all, and this with genuine surprise, as we had not\r\nexpected to see any of these animals for some time to come. They were\r\nnone the less welcome, for our camp was much in need of fresh meat, and\r\nstimulated by this knowledge we procured two rifles from camp and set\r\noff in one of the canoes with two Indians, on a midnight hunt. The lake\r\nhad now become quite calm, and the northern sky a glow of lurid light,\r\nmaking the scene a most enchanting picture, such as can only be seen\r\nwithin the shadow of the Arctic. For three miles our light canoe glided\r\nover the glassy surface of the lake in perfect silence, excepting for\r\nthe faint rippling of the water against its sides, until when near the\r\nshore there suddenly appeared over the adjoining ridge the huge black\r\nforms of nine musk-oxen.”\r\n\r\n                      MUSK-OXEN IN THELON VALLEY.\r\n\r\nThe following paragraph from Mr. Tyrrell’s report is also interesting\r\nunder this head:—“As we glided quickly and quietly down Thelon river,\r\none of the most interesting features met with was the occurrence of\r\nnumerous bands of musk-oxen feeding upon the luxuriant grass or sleeping\r\non the river bank. Attempts were made to obtain photographs of some of\r\nthese noble brutes, but such were not very successful for two reasons;\r\nfirst, because of the wariness of the animals, and second, because of\r\nthe weariness of the photographers.\r\n\r\n“It was observed that when bands of cows with their young were met with,\r\nthey were usually very timid and fled at first approach of danger, but\r\nin the case of straggling bulls, which were frequently seen, they were\r\nmuch more fearless and allowed us to approach as closely as prudence and\r\ntheir defiant attitudes would permit. On one occasion, when Mr.\r\nFairchild climbed the river bank in order to photograph a fine specimen,\r\nhe had no sooner snapped his camera and turned his back, than the brute\r\ncharged and followed him to the bank. He was at once covered by our\r\nrifles, but as Fairchild stepped safely into the canoe, no shots were\r\nfired. Indeed day after day we passed numbers of musk-oxen, without\r\nmolesting them in any way except by trying to photograph them. A notable\r\nfact in regard to the musk-oxen was that every one seen was on the north\r\nside of the Thelon, or on islands on the river. On one occasion when\r\nthree musk-oxen were met with on an island they immediately plunged into\r\nthe water and swam rapidly to the north shore, after gaining which they\r\ncould be seen galloping across the plains for miles.”\r\n\r\nIn his report Mr. J. W. Tyrrell classes the herds of musk-oxen as among\r\nthe resources of the country “which are of great value to Canada.” He\r\nadds:—“For the preservation of the musk-oxen—which may be so easily\r\nslaughtered—and are already rapidly diminishing in numbers, I would\r\nsuggest that the territory between Thelon and Backs rivers, be set apart\r\nby the Government as a game preserve.”\r\n\r\n                       APPEARANCE OF THE MUSK-OX.\r\n\r\nIn his interesting volume “Through the Sub-Arctics of Canada,” Mr.\r\nTyrrell writes:—\r\n\r\n“The musk-oxen are claimed as relatives both by the sheep and ox\r\nfamilies, though they perhaps more properly represent a distinct family\r\nby themselves.\r\n\r\n“In general appearance they may be said to somewhat resemble a huge\r\nbrown, horned sheep, but in size and weight they much more nearly\r\nresemble the ox, or better still, the buffalo, the monarch of the\r\nprairies a generation ago.\r\n\r\n“Like the buffalo, the musk-ox (_Ovibos moschatus_) is gregarious in its\r\nhabits, but where the former existed in thousands the latter is found\r\nonly in tens—a band of twenty or thirty being as many as are commonly\r\nfound together. The above comparison of numbers may also be taken as\r\napproximately representing the whole existing musk-ox family as compared\r\nwith that of the buffalo in his palmy days.\r\n\r\n“In prehistoric times, as shown by the exhumed remains, the musk-ox\r\noccupied a very wide area of the earth’s surface, both in Europe, Asia\r\nand America, but now his range is limited to the northern parts of\r\nCanada and Greenland. From personal observation I have found the\r\nsouthern boundary of the musk-ox habitat to-day to be Hudson strait and\r\nbay, Chesterfield inlet, Thelon river, Clinton-Colden and Aylmer lakes;\r\nwhereas in the time of Samuel Hearne, one hundred and fifty years ago,\r\nwe have his assertion that musk-oxen frequented the vicinity of\r\nChurchill, four hundred miles south of their present haunts.\r\n\r\n“It is no doubt a fact, not only have the musk-oxen been driven farther\r\nand farther from the haunts of men, but that their numbers have been\r\ncorrespondingly reduced from year to year by natives who have long\r\npursued a policy of systematic slaughter in quest of the princely robes\r\nso much in demand by the fur-traders.”\r\n\r\n                    MUSK-OX ROBES STACKED LIKE HAY.\r\n\r\n“The musk-ox is one of the noblest and most valuable animals of the\r\nnorthern shore of Hudson bay and adjacent territory. It is found in very\r\nconsiderable numbers and affords most luxurious robes. I have seen\r\nmusk-ox robes stacked by the Eskimos like hay-cocks, along the shore of\r\nChesterfield inlet, awaiting the opportunity to market them.”\r\n\r\nOn Thelon river, from the junction of the Hanbury down for over half its\r\nlength or about one hundred and fifty miles, Inspector Pelletier, during\r\nhis long patrol already several times referred to, saw innumerable\r\ntracks of musk-ox, some fairly fresh and on both banks. In his official\r\nreport the Inspector states:—\r\n\r\n“On August 9 (the day after the descent of Thelon river was begun), we\r\nsighted our first musk-ox. He was on a small island, lying down asleep,\r\nand looked very much like a large overturned sod until suddenly he rose\r\nand we were astonished at his size. I had always heard a musk-ox was not\r\na large animal. This one we saw was a large bull of not very great\r\nheight—perhaps, I would judge, about thirteen hands, but of immense\r\nsize and weight; he would have scaled very close to fifteen hundred\r\npounds. The long hair was coming down nearly to the ground, and when he\r\ndecided to run away the fur on him was of such thickness and length that\r\nit waved up and down at every gallop as the wings of a bird flying. A\r\nfew miles farther down about noon we sighted another musk-ox. He was on\r\nthe north shore, sleeping on the top of a grassy bank. We made much\r\nnoise to attract his attention. He suddenly rose, and looked straight at\r\nus. While doing so I took a snapshot of him. I was hurrying another\r\nexposure in place when all at once he turned right about and disappeared\r\nover the bank. He was a large animal, but not so large as the first one.\r\nWe were on the lookout for more, but saw none that day. We sighted one\r\nmusk-ox on the morning of August 10. It was the third and last we saw.\r\nWe saw innumerable tracks though, and at certain times of the year large\r\nherds must frequent the shores of this river.”\r\n\r\n                   THE MOOSE AND FUR-BEARING ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nThe moose (_Alces Americanus_) being a woodland animal, is not found in\r\nthe interior of the Barren Lands, but it is found in places in the\r\nsparsely timbered margins of the country and in the narrow wooded strips\r\nand points which extend from the forested areas along the rivers and\r\nlakes well into the treeless plains. Mr. J. W. Tyrrell states that\r\nduring his party’s exploration of the upper Thelon in the summer of\r\n1900, on two occasions moose antlers were found embedded in the sand of\r\nthe river banks. Hanbury states that moose are found in Thelon river,\r\nbelow its junction with the Hanbury, and mentions seeing numerous fresh\r\ntracks and places where the animals had browsed on the willows. In\r\nAugust, 1902, while descending Dease river, northeast of Great Bear\r\nlake, he found tracks along its banks.\r\n\r\nInspector Pelletier, speaking in his official report of the game along\r\nthe Hanbury and Thelon, states:—“There is good fur to be had in winter\r\nbesides musk-ox, such as foxes, wolves, wolverines, brown bears, and\r\nperhaps mink and marten. . . . Many wolves were seen at the foot of Ford\r\nfalls (on the Hanbury). Five were in a pack.”\r\n\r\nMr. J. B. Tyrrell in his paper before the British Association at Toronto\r\nstated:—“The white wolf and the wolverine are the two most common\r\npredatory animals in the interior, while the white bear and white fox\r\nare common in places along the coast.”\r\n\r\nMr. J. W. Tyrrell (“Through the Sub-Arctics of Canada”) states:—“Black\r\nand red as well as white foxes are also commonly found in the country\r\nnorth of the timber line. I have seen and handled a single black foxskin\r\nwhich realized for its owner the sum of one thousand six hundred\r\ndollars.”\r\n\r\n                            THE POLAR BEAR.\r\n\r\nAs to the polar bear, which is found all along the shores of Hudson bay,\r\nand the northern coast, Mr. Tyrrell (“Through the Sub-Arctics of\r\nCanada”) states:—“In the animal world the polar bear is admittedly the\r\nmonarch of the north. He is the bear of bears, being described by all\r\nArctic travellers as possessing enormous strength and great voracity. Of\r\nthe score of polars whose more or less intimate acquaintance I have had\r\noccasion to make, I have seen at least two whose tracks in the snow\r\nmeasured fifteen by eighteen inches, whose length measures over nine\r\nfeet, and whose slain carcases tipped the steelyard at from fifteen to\r\nsixteen hundred pounds.”\r\n\r\nIn the same volume Mr. Tyrrell states:—“Of feathered game there is a\r\ngreat abundance, particularly of waterfowl, the most important of which\r\nare:—Brant, Hutchins and snowy geese; northern, American and king\r\neiders; squaw ducks, swans, loons, nurres, guillemots and many other sea\r\nfowls. In many places I have seen geese in such numbers that they could\r\nbe killed by hundreds with sticks. Ptarmigan, also, are found in great\r\nnumbers in many places in the open country. They are commonly caught by\r\nthe natives with nets, and form a staple article of food.”\r\n\r\n                       WHERE THE WILD GEESE NEST.\r\n\r\nMr. J. W. Tyrrell mentions that two young broods of geese were seen on\r\nDubawnt lake on August 15, 1893. He adds:—“It is commonly said that the\r\nbreeding place of the wild goose has never been discovered, but here, at\r\nany rate, was the breeding place of these.”\r\n\r\nIn the official report of his trip in 1900, Mr. Tyrrell states:—“Many\r\nbroods of geese were observed on the low grassy banks of the Thelon.\r\nThey were of a small grey species, with black necks and heads and white\r\nbands around the latter. Later in the season great numbers of moulting\r\ngeese were met with, and thirty or forty of them were knocked over with\r\nsticks for supplying our kettles.\r\n\r\n“Ducks and ptarmigan were also met with, though not in great numbers,\r\nwhilst the spruce woods were enlivened by the songs of singing birds,\r\nnotably American robins.”\r\n\r\nHearne (p. 170) thus refers to the feathered game in Coppermine river\r\nregion:—“When at the sea-side (at the mouth of Coppermine river),\r\nbesides seeing many seals on the ice, I also observed several flocks of\r\nsea-fowl flying about the shores, such as gulls, blackheads, loons, old\r\nwives, ha-ha-wies, geese, Arctic gulls, and willicks. In the adjacent\r\nponds also were some swans and geese in a moulting state, and in the\r\nmarshes some curlews and plover; plenty of hawkes-eyes (i.e., the green\r\nplover), and some yellow-legs; also several other small birds that visit\r\nthese northern parts in the spring to breed and moult, and which\r\ndoubtless return southward as the fall advances. My reason for this\r\nconjecture is founded on a certain knowledge that all these birds\r\nmigrate in Hudson bay, and it is but reasonable to think that they are\r\nless capable of withstanding the rigour of such a long and cold winter\r\nas they must necessarily experience in a country which is so many\r\ndegrees within the Arctic circle, as that is where I now (July 1771) saw\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n                        FLIGHT OF THE WATERFOWL.\r\n\r\nBack mentions the fact that while at Artillery lake on September 5,\r\n1833, “impending storms were threatened by the cackling of hundreds of\r\ngeese, which at an immense height were winging their flight to the\r\nsouthward. Ranged according to their families, the grey, or bustard, the\r\nwhite and the laughing geese came past in quick succession, vying in\r\nswiftness, as if anxious to escape from the wintry horrors of the\r\nnorth.”\r\n\r\nSpeaking of his exploration of Thelon and Hanbury rivers, Mr. Hanbury\r\n(“Sport and Travel in the Northland of Canada”), referring to feathered\r\ngame along the route, states:—“Ptarmigan are very numerous in the\r\nwillow beds all along the river. Excellent sport might be had by any one\r\nwith time and ammunition to spare. On a journey small game is not\r\ninterfered with unless other meat and fish give out. The ptarmigan were\r\nvery handsome at this time of year (summer). But for a few white\r\nfeathers in the wings, they might easily have been mistaken for grouse,\r\nthe colour, flight and call (both in the early morning and when flushed)\r\nexactly resembling that of the red grouse. The young birds were strong\r\non the wing, fully forward as grouse in the north of Scotland about the\r\nmiddle of August.”\r\n\r\nInspector Pelletier states that when he descended the Thelon waterfowl\r\nwere seen only on Baker lake, and then only a few, while on the other\r\nlakes and rivers none were seen. Ptarmigan were fairly plentiful in\r\nplaces all along the lower stretch from Schultz lake down.\r\n\r\n                    INEXHAUSTIBLE SUPPLIES OF FISH.\r\n\r\nThe resources of the Barren Lands in the way of fish are tremendous. We\r\nknow that the salt, tidal waters which lave the eastern and northern\r\nshores of this huge area teem with fish and that the same can be\r\ntruthfully said of the lakes and rivers which have been explored and are\r\nindicated on the map. We also know that the country is dotted with\r\ninnumerable lakes and drained by many rivers and streams which have\r\nnever been visited by white men, and which consequently find no places\r\non any map. And these too contain fish.\r\n\r\nHearne’s journal contains many references to the fish supply of the\r\nregion he travelled through in 1771 between Churchill, the mouth of the\r\nCoppermine, Great Slave lake, and Lake Athabaska. One of the pioneer\r\nexplorer’s fish stories is particularly interesting. At pages 158, 159\r\nand 160 of his book he relates that his party, in retreating up the\r\nCoppermine after the brutal massacre by his Indians of the Eskimos at\r\nBloody falls (as he called the spot after the massacre), saw an old\r\nwoman, almost blind, “sitting by the side of the water, killing salmon,\r\nwhich lay at the foot of the fall as thick as a shoal of herrings.”\r\nHearne proceeds:—“It may appear strange, that a person supposed to be\r\nalmost blind should be employed in the business of fishing, and\r\nparticularly with any degree of success, but when the multitude of fish\r\nis taken into account the wonder will cease. Indeed they were so\r\nnumerous at the foot of the fall, that when a light pole, armed with a\r\nfew spikes, which was the instrument which the old woman used, was put\r\nunder water, and hauled up with a jerk, it was scarcely possible to miss\r\nthem. Some of my Indians tried the method, for curiosity, with the old\r\nwoman’s staff, and seldom got less than two at a jerk, sometimes three\r\nor four. Those fish, though very fine, and beautifully red, are but\r\nsmall, seldom weighing more (as near as I could judge) than six or seven\r\npounds, and in general much less. Their numbers at this place were\r\nalmost incredible, perhaps equal to any thing that is related of the\r\nsalmon in Kamschatka, or any other part of the world. It does not appear\r\nthat the Eskimos have any other method of catching the fish unless it be\r\nby spears and darts, for no appearance of nets was discovered either at\r\ntheir tents, or on any part of the shore. This is the case with all the\r\nEskimos on the west side of Hudson bay; spearing in summer and angling\r\nin winter are the only methods they have yet devised to catch fish,\r\nthough at times their whole dependence for support is on that article.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Back mentions having observed grayling rising to flies at the\r\noutlet of Pelly lake on Backs river, July 15, 1834. Back also mentions\r\nthat while descending Backs river in July, 1883, his party met a party\r\nof Eskimos who were camped at the foot of a fall below Pelly lake, where\r\nthey had come to get a supply of fish. Thousands of whitefish and small\r\ntrout, caught in the eddy below the fall, lay about, split, and exposed\r\nto dry on the rocks.\r\n\r\nBack’s party caught an inconnu (which he calls _Salmo Mackenzii_) with a\r\nnumber of other fish in the eastern arm of Great Slave lake August 14,\r\n1833.\r\n\r\n                           THE ARCTIC SALMON.\r\n\r\nBefore the Senate committee of 1888, Mr. Christie, Chief Inspector of\r\nthe Hudson’s Bay Company, stated that salmon were found in large numbers\r\non the Churchill, as soon as the ice cleared out of the river, about the\r\nmiddle of July. They entered the river and went out of it with the tide.\r\nThey did not run up the river to spawn. He thought these salmon quite as\r\nlarge as those he had seen in Scotland.\r\n\r\nMr. A. P. Low, Director of the Geological Survey of Canada, examined\r\nbefore the Senate committee of 1907, stated that in the far northern\r\nwaters there are no true salmon, but there is the Arctic salmon, which\r\nis found along the east side of Hudson bay from Cape Jones, and on the\r\nwest side, north of the mouth of Churchill river. These are in many\r\nplaces very abundant and are caught freely in the summer time when they\r\nare out in the sea. They go into the sea about July and return to the\r\nrivers and lakes again some time in September. They are only out there\r\nabout two months. This Arctic salmon is an excellent fish, beautifully\r\ncoloured, a very fine salmon colour, and it is not so rich a fish as the\r\nAtlantic salmon. It resembles the western salmon more than it does the\r\neastern or Atlantic salmon. The salmon fishery on Hudson bay would no\r\ndoubt have commercial value were there an outlet to a market. The\r\nwhitefish of Hudson bay is a very fine flavoured fish.\r\n\r\nThe portion of Hudson bay in the vicinity of Southampton island is where\r\nthe whale fishing is done. Formerly it extended to Marble island.\r\n\r\nIn reply to various questions, Mr. Low said he had no knowledge of\r\nherring or mackerel going into Hudson bay, but there are some cod there.\r\nHe had taken them up near Cape Fullerton and along that coast, but they\r\nhave not been found very plentiful yet.\r\n\r\nIn the report of his explorations in 1893 and 1894, Mr. J. B. Tyrrell\r\nsays:—“It is probable that some of the true salmon ascend the inlets\r\nand streams west of the northern part of Hudson bay, but the fact was\r\nnot definitely determined.” Before the select committee of the Senate in\r\n1907 he stated he did not know what fish there are along the shores of\r\nHudson bay. “The Eskimos report that there are salmon and other fish\r\nthere, but I did not see them myself.”\r\n\r\n                       PLENTY OF SALMON RUNNING.\r\n\r\nMr. Hanbury, speaking of his trip across country from Chesterfield inlet\r\nto the Arctic, reported “plenty of salmon running” in the northern\r\nrivers in June.\r\n\r\nMr. J. W. Tyrrell (“Through the Sub-Arctics of Canada”) states:—“Salmon\r\nof the very finest quality are found in abundance both in Hudson bay and\r\nstrait. I have several times procured them from Eskimos and can testify\r\nas to their superior quality.” Mr. Tyrrell does not state whether any of\r\nthese salmon were caught on the west side of the bay.\r\n\r\nWe find the following interesting paragraphs as to the fish along the\r\nArctic coast in “Sport and Travel in Northern Canada” (Hanbury):—“On\r\nMay 29, after travelling about ten miles, I obtained an observation for\r\nlatitude which gave 68° 25′ north. Three miles more brought us to the\r\neast coast of Kent peninsula, or rather to a small inlet of the coast,\r\nwhere several Huskies were fishing with their copper fish-hooks through\r\nholes in the ice. In the evening they brought me seven of the fish they\r\nhad caught, which proved to be codling, the same in appearance and size\r\nas those we have found around the coast of Great Britain. I was\r\nsurprised to see these fish, for the Hudson bay Huskies had always\r\ndenied the existence of any sort of cod in Hudson bay. The Arctic Husky\r\nname for these codling was u-wuk, and they were reported to be very\r\nplentiful along the coast at this time of year.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Doctor Richardson:—“Trout of various kinds and of large\r\nsize inhabit the rivers that fall into Arctic sea, and on the coast near\r\nthe mouth of Coppermine river, a species closely resembling the\r\nsea-trout of England was abundant in the shallows.”\r\n\r\n                   FISH IN THE DUBAWNT AND THE KAZAN.\r\n\r\nMr. J. B. Tyrrell in the report of his exploratory trips down Dubawnt\r\nand Kazan rivers in 1893 and 1894 states:—“Fish seemed to be everywhere\r\nabundant in the lakes and streams though very few were caught. The lake\r\ntrout (_Cristivomer namaycush_) and whitefish (_Coregonus clupeiformis_)\r\nappeared to be the most abundant and valuable food fishes, the latter\r\nbeing especially abundant in Dubawnt lake. Pike (_Esox lucius_) and one\r\nor more species of suckers were also seen.\r\n\r\nMr. Tyrrell states in his evidence before the Senate committee of 1907\r\nthat as far north as Dubawnt lake (63° north latitude) the whitefish and\r\ntrout were plentiful in all the streams. Mr. Tyrrell caught them in\r\nDubawnt lake. Farther northwards he did not catch any. There are great\r\nquantities of fish. The fact is there are all the fish the lakes will\r\nhold—they are as full as the water can supply food for them.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Tyrrell’s party was descending Dubawnt river in August, 1894,\r\nthey made a big haul of trout and whitefish below Markham lake;\r\naccording to Mr. J. B. Tyrrell (“Through the Sub-Arctics of\r\nCanada”):—“The whitefish ranged from six to ten pounds in weight; the\r\ntrout went up to twenty-five pounds.”\r\n\r\nIn his paper before the British Association Mr. J. W. Tyrrell\r\nstated:—“Whitefish and lake trout are plentiful in the lakes and\r\nstreams; but as yet very little is known about the character and\r\ndistribution of the denizens of most of the water stretches.”\r\n\r\n                     FISH PLENTIFUL IN THE THELON.\r\n\r\nMr. Hanbury in describing his exploration of the Ark-i-linik (Thelon and\r\nHanbury rivers) states:—“Fish were plentiful all along the Ark-i-linik;\r\nin fact, I never saw such a grand river for fish. Trout, whitefish, and\r\ntoolabies (very similar to whitefish) abound, and large numbers can be\r\ntaken with nets of from three to four and one-half inch mesh. There are\r\nfew rivers equal to the Ark-i-linik for food fishes.”\r\n\r\nAll travellers agree that there are large numbers of fish in the eastern\r\narm of Great Slave lake and in the lakes between that sheet of water and\r\nthe Thelon. Mr. J. W. Tyrrell in the report of his trip in 1900\r\nstates:—“The resources of Artillery lake and vicinity, outside of any\r\nmineral wealth it may possess, lie in its fisheries, its furs and meat\r\nsupplies. In regard to the fisheries, I can testify that its deep, cold\r\nwaters abound with the finest specimens of lake trout as well as\r\nwhitefish, pike and carp. At one place in about fifteen minutes, with a\r\nsingle spoon hook, one of my men pulled out eighteen fine trout, some of\r\nwhich were brought to camp, strung on a pole and photographed by me.\r\nSome of these fish were from sixteen to twenty pounds in weight. In\r\nregard to the fish of Artillery lake, I was told\r\n\r\n                        A MOST ASTONISHING STORY\r\n\r\nby the Indian “Pierre Fort Smith” and his companion. They affirm that\r\nthey have frequently seen fish of from twenty to thirty feet long in the\r\nwater, and described them as being of black colour, with long slender\r\nhorns or feelers. They say they have never killed one of them—being\r\nafraid of them—but that they are frequently seen in the deep waters\r\nwhen crossing the lake. When I smiled at their story with some\r\nexpression of doubt, they became very indignant and with one accord\r\nstoutly declared every word of it to be true. I offered them ‘one\r\nhundred skins’ if they would capture or kill one of these fish for me,\r\nbut they only said they could not do so; they were too big, and they\r\nwere afraid of them.”\r\n\r\nIn the report of his patrol from Great Slave lake to Chesterfield inlet,\r\nInspector Pelletier gives us the following notes on fish and game along\r\nhis route:—“We saw no game along the lake (Great Slave lake) such as\r\ndeer, bears, etc., no water fowls, partridges or ptarmigan. Fish, on the\r\ncontrary, are very plentiful. Large lake trout weighing up to\r\ntwenty-five pounds take well to the troll, but this trout is not a game\r\nfish, and is very coarse food. The smaller trout are better in every\r\nway. Whitefish is abundant, and of splendid quality. We saw no\r\n‘Inconnus’, the season being too early.”\r\n\r\n                    ARTILLERY LAKE TEEMS WITH TROUT.\r\n\r\nArtillery lake teems with trout, some of large size, and at the foot of\r\nthe rapids on “Kasba river trout are taken by the troll, some weighing\r\neighteen and twenty pounds. There must be larger ones but we did not\r\nsecure any.\r\n\r\n“At the foot of every rapid on upper Hanbury river trout and grayling\r\ncan be caught. Some trout are very large, over twenty-five pounds. The\r\nbest eating are the small ones about two pounds, the flesh of which is\r\nvery red. They do not rise to the fly, but catch the spoon very well.\r\nThe ordinary maskinonge pattern proved the most successful.”\r\n\r\nAs to Thelon river, the Inspector states:—“Fish are abundant. Anywhere\r\nwhere nets are set whitefish of splendid quality are caught.” As to the\r\nlong reach of lakes above Chesterfield inlet he says:—“Fish are\r\nplentiful in all the lakes. On Baker lake we saw some very large trout\r\njumping near the mouth of a small river emptying into the lake.”\r\n\r\nThe Indians and the few white travellers who have been there report a\r\nplentiful supply of fine fish in all the large lakes north of Great\r\nSlave lake and about the headwaters of Backs river, which used to be\r\nknown as Great Fish river on account of the large fish caught in its\r\nwaters. Mr. Warburton Pike was at Aylmer lake in June 1890 and writes in\r\nhis book (“The Barren Grounds of Northern Canada”):—“At the head of\r\nevery bay a stream ran into the lake, and the open water at its mouth\r\nwas always a sure find for trout; forty or fifty large fish were often\r\ncaught in a day with a hook and line at these places, and, as we could\r\nalways kill caribou, even the dogs were getting fat in this land of\r\nplenty.”\r\n\r\nWe have this testimony from Hanbury (“Sport and Travel in the Northland\r\nof Canada”) as to the fish life of the lakes still farther north and on\r\nthe height of land dividing the Coppermine watershed from that of Great\r\nBear lake:—“We all regretted leaving Teshi-er-pi or Dismal lake. It\r\ncertainly did not appear ‘dismal’ to us, but quite the reverse. I do not\r\nremember ever having come across a lake where fish were so numerous.\r\nLarge trout, some of which ran up to twenty-five pounds, could be seen\r\nswimming in the clear water as we paddled along. The tollabies we caught\r\naveraged nearer five pounds than four, and as before remarked, were most\r\nexcellent eating. Arctic trout were numberless.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader of the preceding pages will have observed, from the variety\r\nof publications from which quotations have been made, that the\r\nliterature relating to the far northlands of Canada is\r\nconsiderable—quite extensive in fact. Below is a partial list of\r\nwritten authorities consulted in the preparation of this book. It does\r\nnot pretend to be a complete bibliography of the country by any means,\r\nmany publications which were carefully read through not being mentioned\r\nbecause they do not throw any direct light upon the natural resources of\r\nthe region, being merely books of adventure, or publications relating\r\nwholly to those topographical features of the country which are clearly\r\nindicated in present-day maps.
