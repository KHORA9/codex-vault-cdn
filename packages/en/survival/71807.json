threads so thin\r\n      Dropping, each a hempen bulk.\r\n\r\n    At the end, an open door;\r\n    Squares of sunshine on the floor\r\n      Light the long and dusky lane;\r\n    And the whirring of a wheel,\r\n    Dull and drowsy, makes me feel\r\n      All its spokes are in my brain.\r\n\r\n    As the spinners to the end\r\n    Downward go and reascend,\r\n      Gleam the long threads in the sun;\r\n    While within this brain of mine\r\n    Cobwebs brighter and more fine\r\n      By the busy wheel are spun.\r\n\r\n    Two fair maidens in a swing,\r\n    Like white doves upon the wing,\r\n      First before my vision pass;\r\n    Laughing, as their gentle hands\r\n    Closely clasp the twisted strands,\r\n      At their shadow on the grass.\r\n\r\n    Then a booth of mountebanks,\r\n    With its smell of tan and planks,\r\n      And a girl poised high in air\r\n    On a cord, in spangled dress,\r\n    With a faded loveliness,\r\n      And a weary look of care.\r\n\r\n    Then a homestead among farms,\r\n    And a woman with bare arms\r\n      Drawing water from a well;\r\n    As the bucket mounts apace,\r\n    With it mounts her own fair face,\r\n      As at some magician’s spell.\r\n\r\n    Then an old man in a tower,\r\n    Ringing loud the noontide hour,\r\n      While the rope coils round and round\r\n    Like a serpent at his feet,\r\n    And again, in swift retreat,\r\n      Nearly lifts him from the ground.\r\n\r\n    Then within a prison-yard,\r\n    Faces fixed, and stern, and hard,\r\n      Laughter and indecent mirth;\r\n    Ah! it is the gallows-tree!\r\n    Breath of Christian charity,\r\n      Blow, and sweep it from the earth!\r\n\r\n    Then a schoolboy, with his kite\r\n    Gleaming in a sky of light,\r\n      And an eager, upward look;\r\n    Steeds pursued through lane and field;\r\n    Fowlers with their snares concealed;\r\n      And an angler by a brook.\r\n\r\n    Ships rejoicing in the breeze,\r\n    Wrecks that float o’er unknown seas,\r\n      Anchors dragged through faithless sand;\r\n    Sea-fog drifting overhead,\r\n    And, with lessening line and lead,\r\n      Sailors feeling for the land.\r\n\r\n    All these scenes do I behold,\r\n    These, and many left untold,\r\n      In that building long and low;\r\n    While the wheel goes round and round,\r\n    With a drowsy, dreamy sound,\r\n      And the spinners backward go.\r\n\r\n                                   --LONGFELLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nANCIENT, MEDIÆVAL AND TRIBAL ROPE-MAKING\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many people have ever given a thought to the question of where\r\nrope comes from and how it is made, or realize what a variety of uses\r\nit is put to, and how dependent we are upon it in many of the everyday\r\naffairs of life? But let us suppose for a moment that the world were\r\nsuddenly deprived of its supply of this very commonplace material,\r\nand of its smaller relatives, cords and twine. We should then begin\r\nto realize the importance of a seemingly unimportant thing, and to\r\nappreciate the difficulty in getting along without it.\r\n\r\nLongfellow, in his poem “The Ropewalk,” which we have printed, shows\r\nthat he recognized the scope of the usefulness of rope, and appreciated\r\nthe romance and pathos connected with the use of a seemingly prosaic\r\narticle; for in his brief catalogue of the uses of rope which passed in\r\npictured procession through his mind, as he stood in the ropewalk and\r\ncame under the influence of the drowsy hum and whir of the spinners’\r\nwheels, he succeeded in covering a good share of the changing phases\r\nin the drama of human life: childhood in its swing, happy, without a\r\ncare; the life of the sailor, which, with its heroism, its romance, its\r\ncourageous meeting of danger or disaster, has always been the subject\r\nof verse and story; the pathetic picture of the faded beauty on the\r\ntight rope; and the tragic scene of the criminal dying upon the gallows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT EGYPTIAN ROPE]\r\n\r\n“All these and many left untold,” the poet says, and when we once begin\r\nto let our thoughts run we find uses almost innumerable, on sea and\r\nland, to which our rope is put. Then, if we allow ourselves to come\r\nmore and more under the drowsy spell of the wheels, we wonder how long\r\nall these things have been going on, and when, where and how the first\r\nrope was made and used.\r\n\r\nA little investigation shows us that the use of rope is older than\r\nhistory itself. Back beyond the time of any authentic record of events,\r\nbeyond even the range of tradition, the first rope-makers did their\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIn his very earliest days man must have had something to serve for\r\ncords or lines,--strips of hide or of bark, pliant reeds and rushes,\r\nwithes of tough woods, fibrous roots, hair of animals,--then, as the\r\nneed arose for longer, larger and stronger lines, it was met, as human\r\ningenuity developed, by twisting a number of some of these elements\r\ntogether and forming a rope or cord. Just who was the prehistoric\r\ngenius that first performed this operation, or in what part of the\r\nworld he lived, we have no means of knowing.\r\n\r\nCertain it is, according to the best authority, that not only were the\r\nancient civilized nations accomplished rope-makers, but savage tribes\r\nin all parts of the world, for unknown thousands of years, have been\r\nable to make ropes and cords from a great variety of materials, and the\r\nbeauty of their workmanship in many cases is little short of marvelous.\r\n\r\nThe North American Indians, for instance, are known to have made\r\ncordage not only from well-known fiber plants, as cotton, yucca and\r\nagave, but from such plants as the dogbane and nettle; from the inner\r\nbark of trees, slippery elm, willow, linden; from the fibrous roots\r\nof the spruce and pine; and from the hair, skins or sinews of various\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOOTKA WHALING LINES]\r\n\r\nThe native Peruvians were good rope-makers, using a substance known as\r\n“totora,” as well as many other materials. The Island tribes of the\r\nSouth Seas, expert in making rope, are favored with some very good\r\nmaterials for its manufacture, obtained from the leaves of various\r\npalms and plantains, from the fiber of the cocoanut, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs, at the present day, the shipping and fishing industries are among\r\nthe principal users of cordage, so it has been among all tribes and\r\nnations from earliest times. The people who lived on islands or\r\nthe shores of large bodies of water, and who thus naturally became\r\nfishermen, have been the larger users of ropes and lines, and we find\r\nthey always have been capable of producing a wide variety of fishing\r\nlines and nets of excellent construction, capable of capturing all\r\nsorts of fish, from the smallest brook trout to the huge sturgeon or\r\nhalibut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCENE IN AN EGYPTIAN KITCHEN SHOWING USE OF A LARGE ROPE\r\nTO SUPPORT A SORT OF HANGING SHELF]\r\n\r\nEven the whale has been successfully hunted by some adventurous tribes,\r\nand we show a picture of lines made by the Nootka Indians of Vancouver\r\nIsland,[A] which are used by them in harpooning whales. The smaller\r\nrope is made from sinews of the whale, served or wound with small cord.\r\nIt is very pliable and exceedingly strong. The harpoon is fastened to\r\nthis line, which, in turn, is fastened to the larger rope and that to\r\nthe boat. The large rope shown is made from spruce roots and is about\r\ntwo inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n    [A] The photograph shown on page 13 was taken expressly for\r\n        us through the courtesy of the officials of the Peabody\r\n        Museum, Cambridge, Mass., to whom we are also indebted\r\n        for our information concerning the use of rope among the\r\n        various primitive tribes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT EGYPTIAN RELICS\r\n\r\nBRIDLE OF HEMP ROPE COVERED WITH WOVEN COTTON--HALTER OF BRAIDED\r\nLEATHER BASKET WITH ROPE HANDLES--PALM FIBER ROPE]\r\n\r\nAncient civilized peoples had their ropes and cordage, made from\r\nsuch materials as were available in their respective countries. The\r\nEgyptians are said to have made rope from leather thongs, and our\r\nillustration on page 14 will be found interesting in this connection.\r\nThis is from a sculpture taken from a tomb in Thebes of the time of the\r\nPharaoh of the Exodus.\r\n\r\nWhile this scene is said by the best authority to represent the\r\npreparation of leather cords for use in lacing sandals, it has been\r\nsupposed by some to be a representation of rope-making. In any event,\r\nthe process is undoubtedly the same as that used in making rope.\r\n\r\nThe scene is depicted with the true Egyptian faculty for showing\r\ndetails, making words almost unnecessary to an understanding of their\r\npictorial records. We see the raw material in the shape of the hide,\r\nand also two well-made coils of the finished product. One of the\r\nworkmen is cutting a strand from a hide by revolving it and cutting as\r\nit turns. Anyone who has not tried it will be surprised to see what a\r\ngood, even string can be cut from a piece of leather in this way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DETAIL OF BAS-RELIEF FROM TRIUMPHAL ARCH AT ORANGE]\r\n\r\nAnother man is arranging and paying out the thongs to a third, who\r\nis evidently walking backward in time-honored fashion, twisting as\r\nhe goes. The thongs are evidently tied to a sort of swivel which is\r\nfastened to the man’s body in such a way that it enables him to keep a\r\nstrain upon the strand without interfering with the twisting, in which\r\nprocess the weight shown upon the swivel is probably of some assistance.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians also made rope from papyrus and from palm fiber. The\r\nspecimen shown in our illustration[B] is from the latter material, and\r\nwas made probably not less than 3,500 years ago, having been taken\r\nfrom an ancient tomb. It has always been a puzzling question how the\r\nEgyptians were able to move and put in place the massive stones\r\nused in some of their structures, but it is certain that rope must\r\nhave been an indispensable part of their equipment. Indeed, some of\r\nthe sculptures illustrate the free use of rope in moving heavy stone\r\ncarvings. It is known that rope was made in China at a very remote\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n    [B] See page 15. Photograph from the original specimens taken\r\n        expressly for us through the courtesy of the Boston Museum\r\n        of Fine Arts.\r\n\r\nIt is of course certain that when men began to propel boats by means\r\nof sails, some sort of rope must have been at hand for rigging such\r\nvessels. The early history of the building of sailing ships seems to be\r\nlost in obscurity, but many of the ancients were good sailors, there\r\nseeming to be some difference of opinion as to who were the pioneers in\r\nundertaking long voyages. We show an illustration of an Attic sailing\r\nship of the sixth century B.C. The drawing was made from the painting\r\non a drinking cup in the collection of the British Museum. We also give\r\na picture illustrating a detail of the bas-relief from the triumphal\r\narch at Orange erected about A.D. 41. This shows an anchor and a coil\r\nof rope, evidently a halyard for a good-sized sail, rove through a\r\npulley. In these and numerous other cases we have records of the use of\r\nrope among the Greeks and Romans, as well as similar ones from other\r\nnations, handed down to us through their sculptures and paintings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ATTIC SAILING SHIP, SIXTH CENTURY B.C.]\r\n\r\nThe historians also occasionally mention the use of rope in connection\r\nwith some great undertaking. Herodotus tells us that Xerxes, during\r\nhis invasion of Greece, B.C. 480, crossed his army over the Hellespont\r\nupon two bridges of boats, which were held together, and the plank\r\nroadway supported, by enormous cables stretched from shore to shore,\r\na distance of seven-eighths of a mile. It is said that these ropes,\r\nof which there were six to each bridge, were twenty-eight inches in\r\ncircumference, two of each set being made of flax and four of papyrus.\r\nIt is stated that the famous galley, the _Syracusia_, built for Hiero\r\nunder the supervision of Archimedes, was furnished with hempen rope\r\nfrom Rhodes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAYFLOWER IN PLYMOUTH HARBOR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nROPE-MAKING IN THE SEVENTEENTH, EIGHTEENTH AND EARLY NINETEENTH\r\nCENTURIES\r\n\r\n\r\nComing down to more recent times we find that rope-making had been\r\ngoing on for centuries with probably very little change, up to the time\r\nof the introduction of machinery and the establishment of the factory\r\nsystem. It had been carried on as a domestic industry, or a trade\r\nhanded down from father to son, and naturally was of most importance in\r\nthe principal seaport towns where vessels were built or fitted out.\r\n\r\nThis was the state of the business at the time of the settlement of\r\nAmerica, and it was not long before the rope-maker began to be needed\r\nas a citizen of the new Colonies. This need was felt in Boston with\r\nthe first efforts at shipbuilding there, and was also suggested by\r\nthe great demand for fishing lines, the cod-fisheries being of great\r\nimportance upon the Massachusetts coast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OFFICE OF PLYMOUTH CORDAGE COMPANY]\r\n\r\nIt is recorded that rope was made in Boston as early as 1641 or 1642.\r\nJohn Harrison, a rope-maker of Salisbury, England, came to this country\r\nat the request of a number of citizens of Boston, and set up his\r\nbusiness in that village. He seems to have had a monopoly of the local\r\ntrade for a good many years, under the paternal protection of the town\r\nauthorities, for John Heyman, to whom permission to make rope in Boston\r\nwas given in 1662, was the next year ordered to give up the work and\r\ndepart from the town, it being found that this competition interfered\r\nwith Harrison’s business to such an extent as to make it difficult for\r\nhim to properly support his family of eleven persons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOURNE SPOONER]\r\n\r\nHowever, upon the death of Harrison this monopoly came to an end, and\r\nropewalks began to multiply in Boston as well as in other parts of the\r\ncountry. In 1794 there were fourteen large ropewalks in Boston, the\r\nbusiness having steadily increased with the development of the new\r\ncountry. The importance of this industry is shown by the report that in\r\nthe federal procession in Boston in 1788, the rope-makers outnumbered\r\nany other class of mechanics.\r\n\r\nIn 1810 there were 173 ropewalks in the United States, scattered over\r\nthe country from Maine to Kentucky.\r\n\r\nIn 1824 the infant Plymouth Cordage Company entered upon the scene and\r\ngradually but surely became an important factor in the trade, until\r\ntoday it stands at the head.\r\n\r\nIn the first half of the last century Manila hemp began to take its\r\nplace as a cordage fiber. According to official records, 27,820 bales\r\nwere imported to the United States in 1843. This figure looks small\r\nwhen compared with a recent high figure of approximately 830,000 bales\r\nin a single year. The first record of the importation of Sisal is in\r\n1860, when the United States received 1,393 bales. This has increased\r\nto 1,000,000 bales.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                         PATENT AND COMMON-LAID\r\n\r\n                               _CORDAGE_,\r\n\r\n                      Manufactured by Water-Power.\r\n\r\n              The _Plymouth Cordage Company_ hereby\r\n              give notice, that they have on hand _One\r\n              Hundred Tons, Clean St. Petersburg Hemp_,\r\n              of superior quality, which they are ready\r\n              to manufacture into _Cordage_ of any size\r\n              or description to suit purchasers.

A number of good Spinners would find\r\n              employment as above.\r\n\r\n             PLYMOUTH CORDAGE COMPANY’S FIRST ADVERTISEMENT\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe large consumption of Sisal during recent years has been caused by\r\nthe production of binder twine, which has now become an important part\r\nof the cordage business. This company first made binder twine in 1882.\r\nIn 1899 it completed its No. 2 Mill, devoted entirely to this product,\r\nand by the completion of the Welland (Ontario) factory in 1906 was\r\nenabled to supply its large Canadian trade from that point. The Sheaf\r\nof Wheat trademark and the name “Plymouth” on binder twine are now\r\nknown the world over and, as in the case of the Ship brand on rope, are\r\nalways recognized as standing for quality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD-TIME METHOD OF HACKLING]\r\n\r\nIn the early days to which we have referred, all the yarn for\r\nrope-making was spun by hand in the time-honored way. We are able to\r\nrepresent to our readers, by the photographs shown, this now almost\r\nlost art. The material shown in the pictures is American hemp, which,\r\nbecause the earlier machines were not adapted to working this softer\r\nfiber, continued to be spun by hand long after Manila was spun chiefly\r\non machines.\r\n\r\nThe hemp was first hackled, as is also shown by our photograph, the\r\nhackle or “hechel” being simply a board having long, sharp steel teeth\r\nset into it. This combed out the tow or short, matted fiber, leaving\r\nthe clean, straight hemp. This “strike” of hemp the spinner wrapped\r\nabout his waist, bringing the ends around his back and tucking them\r\ninto his belt, thus keeping the material in place without knot or\r\ntwist, and allowing the fibers to pay out freely.\r\n\r\nThe workman in our picture is Johnny Moores, an old-time expert\r\nhand-spinner, who could walk off backward from the wheel with his wad\r\nof hemp, spinning with each hand a thread as fine and even as could\r\nbe asked for. In the photograph, in order to show the process more\r\nclearly, one large yarn is being spun.\r\n\r\nThe large wheel, usually turned by a boy, is used to convey power to\r\nthe “whirls” or small spindles carrying hooks upon which the fiber\r\nis fastened. These whirls, revolving, give the twist to the yarn as\r\nthe spinner deftly pays out the fiber, regulating it with skillful\r\nfingers to preserve the uniformity and proper size of the yarn. As he\r\ngoes backward down the long walk through the “squares of sunlight on\r\nthe floor” he throws the trailing yarns over the “stakes” placed at\r\nintervals along the walk for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe spinning “grounds” were usually arranged with wheels at either end,\r\nso that spinners, reaching the farther end, could go back to their\r\nstarting point spinning another set of yarns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAND SPINNING]\r\n\r\nThen, in the case of small ropes, the strands could be made by\r\nattaching two or more yarns to the “whirl” and twisting them together,\r\nreversing the motion to give the strands a twist opposite to that given\r\nthe yarns. These strands were twisted together, again reversing the\r\nmotion, making a rope. Thus it will be seen that, reduced to its lowest\r\nterms, rope-making consists simply of a series of twisting processes.\r\nThe twisting of the yarns into the strand is known as “forming” or\r\nputting in the “foreturn.” The final process is “laying,” “closing”\r\nor putting in the “afterturn.” Horse power was used in old times for\r\nforming and laying rope which was too large to be made by hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PILGRIM HALL, PLYMOUTH]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nMANILA FIBER\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any manufacturing enterprise the question of raw materials is one\r\nof the highest importance. No manufacturer can become extensively\r\nsuccessful without an intimate knowledge of the material entering into\r\nhis product. He must be an expert judge of its quality to be able to\r\ndetermine for himself the exact value of what is offered him and its\r\nadaptability for his particular purposes; he must be closely in touch\r\nwith all the markets; he must know all the conditions surrounding the\r\nproduction and marketing of the material; he must be fully posted as to\r\nall causes, natural and speculative, affecting the supply or the demand.\r\n\r\nTo be most valuable, this knowledge must not only cover matters\r\naffecting the present, but must forecast the future with the greatest\r\npossible degree of certainty. Such foresight is particularly valuable\r\nin the cordage business, where material must be provided for many\r\nmonths before it is used. This factor has always been conspicuous in\r\nthe management of the Plymouth Cordage Company, and has contributed not\r\na little to its continued and increasing growth and prosperity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HANK OF MANILA 12 FEET LONG]\r\n\r\nFor the rope-maker the raw material _par excellence_ is the so-called\r\n“Manila hemp.” Strictly speaking this is not a hemp at all, being a\r\nfiber obtained from the wild banana plant of the Philippine Islands.\r\nThe botanists tell us to call this plant _Musa Textilis_, but the\r\nFilipino, who ought to know, calls both the plant and its fiber “Abacá.”\r\n\r\nThe Philippines have a monopoly of this very important plant, as it\r\nhas never been successfully cultivated elsewhere. So it will be seen\r\nat the start that the user of Manila hemp is dependent entirely upon\r\nour foreign possessions in the far East for his supply. Like most\r\nmonopolists, the Filipino is not particularly susceptible to the wishes\r\nof his customers, and the procuring of hemp produced and prepared in\r\nthe way to make it most valuable for rope-making is attended with some\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nThe Abacá is cultivated by setting out shoots of the plant after a\r\nsuitable tract of land has been cleared. When the field has had proper\r\ncultivation for a period of two or three years some of the plants will\r\nbe ready to cut. They will then be tree-like in shape, and from fifteen\r\nto twenty-five feet in height. The stalk, some fifteen feet long, and\r\na foot or more in diameter, is composed of the separate leaf stems\r\ngrowing compactly together in overlapping layers.\r\n\r\nThe fiber is contained in the outer bark of these leaf stems, their\r\ninner portions being of a soft, pulpy nature. After the stalk is cut\r\nthe native peels off strips of this fibrous bark, and after stripping\r\nthe outer layer of stems, scrapes off its remaining pulp and proceeds\r\nto strip the next inner layer. This process is kept up through all the\r\nsuccessive layers. The fiber from the inner layers of stems is finer\r\nand whiter than that from the outside.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHILIPPINE HEMP CART]\r\n\r\nThe fibrous strips are then cleaned by drawing them under a knife\r\nhinged over a block of wood. This scraping frees the fibers from the\r\nsurrounding pulp. The quality of the hemp depends very much upon the\r\nthoroughness with which this cleaning is done. By using a smooth-edged\r\nknife and putting considerable pressure upon it during the operation,\r\na fiber is secured of high strength and good color. However, this\r\nmeans strenuous work on the part of the operator, and our brown\r\nfellow-citizen, like many of his white brethren, is averse to tiring\r\nhis back; consequently the bulk of the fiber put upon the market is\r\ncleaned under knives with rough edges and loosely held against the\r\nmaterial. This makes the workman’s task easier and enables him to turn\r\nout a larger product, but of an inferior quality. Hence one of the\r\nworries of the manufacturer of high-grade cordage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “STRENUOUS WORK”]\r\n\r\nThis, briefly, is the way Manila hemp is extracted from its parent\r\nstalk. A fortune awaits anyone who will perfect machinery capable of\r\nsuperseding these antiquated hand methods.\r\n\r\nAfter scraping, the fiber is hung over bamboo poles to dry. When\r\nthoroughly dried, it is tied up in hanks and carried to market. In\r\nthe warehouse of the exporter the fiber is sorted and graded and then\r\npacked in bales of 275 pounds. In this form it eventually reaches the\r\ncordage factory.\r\n\r\nWith this description, let us sum up some of the elements entering into\r\nthe quality of various parcels of hemp, which will be of interest as\r\nshowing the task imposed upon the manufacturer in selecting the quality\r\nof fiber necessary to furnish rope of the required standard. It must be\r\nstrongly impressed upon the mind that the fact that a certain rope may\r\nbe honestly called “Manila” is no proof of its strength, durability or\r\ngeneral value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLLECTING THE STALKS\r\n\r\nSTRIPPING AND SCRAPING\r\n\r\nDRYING--TYING IN HANKS\r\n\r\nFILIPINOS PREPARING MANILA FIBER]\r\n\r\nIn the first place, there are some fourteen varieties of the _Musa\r\nTextilis_, presenting a like range in the quality of fiber produced.\r\nThen each process of gathering and preparation presents opportunities\r\nfor deterioration: the plant must be cut at just the right time, and\r\nif, after cutting, the stalk is allowed to remain too long before it is\r\nstripped, the fiber is injured. We have already seen that quality is\r\nlargely dependent upon the character of the knife used in cleaning and\r\nthe care given to this operation. Likewise, for best results, the fiber\r\nmust have proper care while drying.\r\n\r\nAs all these operations are in the hands of people not noted for\r\nindustry or carefulness, it will be easily understood that the\r\nresulting output contains but a small percentage of really first-class\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nTo get an idea of the wide range in quality of Manila hemp, we have\r\nbut to refer to any broker’s list of offerings, which will show prices\r\nvarying from six to thirteen cents, or in similar proportion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXAMINING MANILA FIBER AT DOCK]\r\n\r\nFor a number of years past prices of Manila hemp have ruled much higher\r\nthan previously.\r\n\r\nThis great increase in price has placed the rope manufacturer in a\r\ndifficult position. He must either use a poorer grade of material in\r\nhis goods or must raise his prices to a point which, to his customers,\r\nmay seem excessive.\r\n\r\nThe reluctance on the part of manufacturers to accept the latter\r\nalternative has led to the use of low-grade Manila, and to mixing\r\nManila with inferior fibers (Sisal, New Zealand, etc.), to a greater\r\nextent than at any other period in the history of the industry.\r\n\r\nThe Plymouth Cordage Company, however, has steadily held the opposing\r\nposition, and has continually been on the alert to secure the grade of\r\nhemp necessary to maintain its long-established standard of quality.\r\nNot a particle of any other fiber has entered into our Manila rope.\r\n\r\nThis is because of our knowledge that a high-grade rope can be\r\nproduced, with the proper facilities, to sell at a price relatively\r\nlower than one made from cheaper materials. This, of course, because\r\nthe advantages of lightness, strength and durability more than\r\noutweigh the difference in price per pound. This is true from a\r\nstrictly dollars-and-cents standpoint, to say nothing of the greater\r\nsatisfaction in using the better article.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “SUBURB OF MANILA”\r\n\r\nABACÁ GROWING]\r\n\r\nThe making of cheap Manila (or so-called Manila) rope has been carried\r\nto such an extent that recently signs of a reaction have been apparent.\r\nWriters in trade journals are protesting against the lengths to which\r\nthe cheapening of rope is being carried; buyers are learning that\r\nquality and economy are close companions in the rope trade; and so the\r\ncorrectness of our position is being more fully demonstrated every day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHILIPPINE STREET SCENE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSISAL FIBER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American cordage manufacturer is an importer; very little of the\r\nfiber entering into his product is grown at home. We have already\r\nseen how the principal cordage fiber--Manila--is brought from the\r\nPhilippines. Fiber is also imported from Russia, from Italy, and from\r\nNew Zealand, but we wish to speak now of the material which, next\r\nto Manila, is most used in hard-fiber cordage--Sisal--and which is\r\nsecured from one of our nearer neighbors. This fiber is obtained from\r\nthe leaves of a cactus-like plant belonging to the _Agave_ family.\r\nWhile varieties of this plant grow in many parts of the world, it is\r\ncultivated most extensively in Mexico, the state of Yucatan being the\r\nchief center of production and Merida the capital of the state the\r\nprincipal market. Several railroads connect Merida with its seaport,\r\nProgreso, whence the fiber for export is shipped.\r\n\r\nAs Sisal more than any other fiber is used as a substitute for, or\r\ncompetitor of, Manila, we may make a brief comparison of the two.\r\n\r\nThe length of Manila fiber is usually from six to ten feet, while that\r\nof Sisal is only from two to four feet. The tensile strength of Sisal\r\nis not more than three-fourths that of Manila.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIELD OF SISAL PLANTS\r\n\r\nCUTTING LEAVES\r\n\r\nTRIMMING OFF THORNS]\r\n\r\nThe color of Sisal is quite attractive, being a yellowish white, with\r\nsometimes a slight greenish tinge. Some fine lots of the fiber are\r\nvery nearly white, but it all lacks the gloss and brilliancy which are\r\ncharacteristic of good quality Manila.\r\n\r\nManila is noted for its smoothness and pliability, which make it an\r\nideal fiber for rope-making. Sisal, on the other hand, is without\r\nthis flexibility, and is much more stiff and harsh. This accounts for\r\nthe presence of the unpleasant “splinters” in a Sisal rope, and their\r\nappearance in so-called Manila rope is an indication of the use of\r\nSisal as an adulterant. Sisal is also more easily injured by exposure\r\nto moisture and varying atmospheric conditions than Manila.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOADING LEAVES ON CAR]\r\n\r\nWhile some of these qualities work against the use of Sisal in rope for\r\ngeneral purposes where the question of durability is a factor, or even\r\nwhen softness and ease of handling are considered, this fiber is not\r\nwithout uses which it admirably serves. When a rope or yarn is wanted\r\nfor tying purposes, where it is used as a band and then discarded,\r\nSisal can be used to advantage, as it is of sufficient strength and can\r\nbe spun with a fair degree of smoothness. It may be readily treated\r\nwith tar, which is an advantage when the material upon which it is used\r\nis to be stored out of doors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEAVES READY FOR CLEANING\r\n\r\nELEVATOR TAKING LEAVES UP TO MACHINE]\r\n\r\nSisal is largely used by this company for making Lathyarn and tie ropes\r\nof various kinds used for bundling laths, shingles, lumber, kindling\r\nwood, cooperage stock, hides, leather, nursery stock, for tying grain\r\nand cement sacks, for baling cloth in textile mills and for similar\r\npurposes almost innumerable.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest use we make of this fiber and the use which has\r\ndone much to place Sisal in its high position in the fiber family,\r\nand has helped to make the Mexican state of Yucatan wealthy in a\r\ncomparatively few years, is in the making of binder twine. The advent\r\nand development of the self-binding reaper have opened a veritable gold\r\nmine for the Mexican Sisal growers, and a large proportion of the more\r\nthan 300,000,000 pounds of Sisal annually imported to this country\r\neventually finds its way to the wheat fields, not only of our own great\r\nWest, but of all the world’s grain-raising countries.\r\n\r\nA fiber so largely used can hardly help being a factor in the\r\nmarkets, and some account of its production should be of interest.\r\nThis story we shall tell briefly, and largely by the use of pictures.\r\nThese illustrations, to which we draw particular attention, are from\r\nphotographic negatives in our possession which were taken in Yucatan\r\nexpressly for us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BALES WEIGH ABOUT 370 POUNDS]\r\n\r\nThe Sisal or _heniquen_ plant of Yucatan has been used for its fiber\r\nfor many centuries, but, as we have stated, the present enormous\r\ndevelopment of the industry dates back but comparatively few years,\r\nduring which time great progress has been made in putting it upon a\r\nhighly practical basis as regards both the cultivation of the plant and\r\nthe preparation of the fiber. Labor-saving machinery is used in place\r\nof the old hand methods for extracting the fiber; indeed, the business\r\nis now so thoroughly up to date that reports are frequently circulated\r\nof the organization or contemplated organization of a “Sisal trust.”\r\nApparently, however, the right “Napoleon of Finance” has not yet come\r\nto the fore to accomplish this.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the _heniquen_ is now carried on principally upon\r\nlarge farms or plantations known as _haciendas_, many of which have\r\nmade their owners enormously wealthy. In starting a field of plants\r\nthe suckers or _hijos_ are set out in rows, and cultivation is carried\r\non once or twice a year to keep down the weeds. The appearance of the\r\nfields of Sisal and of the growing and matured plants may be seen from\r\nour illustrations. When the plant has been growing about five years\r\nsome of the long, sword-like leaves will be ready to cut, those around\r\nthe base of the plant maturing first. The time for cutting is indicated\r\nby the leaves assuming a nearly horizontal position instead of the more\r\nupright one of the younger leaves, at which stage the fiber is at its\r\nbest. Then the natives, with their _corbas_ go through the fields and\r\ncut off the matured leaves, trim the sharp thorns from the sides and\r\nends, and tie up the leaves in bundles of fifty, ready to be carried to\r\nthe cleaning mill.\r\n\r\nThe plant continues to yield a supply of leaves for a period of from\r\nten to twenty years. The end of its usefulness is marked by the\r\nappearance of the flower stalk or “pole,” and the plant soon dies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLEANED FIBER COMING OUT OF CLEANING MACHINE]\r\n\r\nMost of the large _haciendas_ are supplied with portable tracks, and\r\nsmall cars carry the bundles of freshly cut leaves from the fields to\r\nthe cleaner house, where the pulp is scraped from the fiber by the\r\npowerful cleaning machinery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SISAL DRYING]\r\n\r\nAs will be seen in the photographs, the bundles of leaves are taken up\r\non an elevator and along a carrier, which feeds them into the machine.\r\nThe grip chains of the carrier hold the leaves, while the scraping\r\nwheels clean the pulp from the fiber, first one end of the leaves being\r\ncleaned and then, as they are carried farther along, the second wheel\r\ncleans the other end. This leaves the bundles of the fiber still in the\r\ngrip of the carrier, which takes it out of the machine as shown in the\r\npicture. It is then carefully hung in the sun to dry. When thoroughly\r\ndry the fiber is taken to the press and made into bales weighing about\r\n370 pounds each.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned the fact that Manila rope is frequently\r\nadulterated with cheaper and inferior fibers, and so Sisal in its turn\r\nhas its inferior imitators, the most common of which is known as Istle,\r\na fiber which also grows in Mexico as well as in other parts of the\r\nworld. A recent government publication, speaking of the use of Istle in\r\ncordage, states, “this fiber has been regarded heretofore as suitable\r\nonly for use in the _manufacture of brushes_.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1.

OTHER FIBERS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the fibers we have already discussed--Manila and Sisal--comprise\r\nby far the greater part of the raw material of cordage, we wish to\r\nmention in this chapter a fiber which, while now of comparatively\r\nslight importance, has the interesting feature of being a home\r\nproduct, and the cultivation of which at one time formed an industry\r\nof considerable magnitude in this country. This is the American or\r\nKentucky hemp.\r\n\r\nMost of the cordage fibers are commonly known as hemp, but strictly\r\nspeaking this name applies only to the fiber of the hemp plant\r\n(_Cannabis sativa_), of which the American hemp is an example. This\r\nhemp plant, while a native of Asia, has for many years been grown in\r\nthe different countries of Europe as well as in America. Its fiber in\r\ncommerce takes the name of the country from which it comes, as Russian\r\nhemp, Italian hemp, etc.\r\n\r\nThe character of the plant and of its fiber varies considerably,\r\ndepending upon the conditions of climate and soil in the various\r\nsections where it is produced. The fiber is also more or less affected\r\nby the varying methods of preparation used in different places. The\r\nItalian hemp, particularly, is finer, lighter colored and stronger than\r\nAmerican or Russian, and commands a higher price in the market.\r\n\r\nHemp differs from Manila and Sisal by being what is known as a bast\r\nfiber, being obtained from the bark of the plant, which necessitates\r\naltogether different methods of treatment in extracting the fiber.\r\n\r\nThe pictures below and opposite, which are from photographs secured\r\nthrough the courtesy of Messrs. T. P. Curry & Son, Danville, Ky., give\r\nan interesting glimpse of the Kentucky hemp industry. The plants are\r\ncut and spread out to dry, after which they are gathered together in\r\nbundles and carefully stacked. Later the stacks are opened and the hemp\r\nagain spread out for exposure to the action of the dew, frost and sun\r\nduring the retting process which rots the gums holding the filaments\r\ntogether. The inner, woody part of the stem also becomes dry and\r\nbrittle by this treatment so that it breaks and falls away during the\r\n“breaking” which follows. This process of breaking leaves the fibrous\r\nstrips or bands in such shape that they can be readily hackled, thus\r\ncleaning out any remaining fragments of wood, short fibers and dirt,\r\nleaving the long, smooth fiber ready to be bunched together and pressed\r\ninto bales.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMERICAN HEMP STACKED IN FIELDS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUTTING THE HEMP--BREAKING--HACKLING--BALING]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW ZEALAND FLAX]\r\n\r\nAmerican hemp differs from Manila by being much softer and of a dark\r\ngray color, and is sometimes known as black hemp. Like the Russian and\r\nItalian varieties, it is used by cordage manufacturers principally for\r\nmaking various tarred goods, such as ratline, marline, houseline and\r\nother products. Before the Manila fiber was so largely used in this\r\ncountry for rope-making, the Kentucky hemp business was of considerable\r\nimportance, but it has of late years declined very greatly and is now\r\nof interest chiefly as representing that class of industries which have\r\nbeen robbed of their former importance by changing conditions. Years\r\nago the American hemp went into the rigging of many a famous vessel,\r\nboth merchantman and man-of-war, and was a source of pride to its\r\npatriotic producers and users. But the substitution of steam vessels\r\nfor sail and the use of other fibers and of wire for rigging have\r\ntaken away the great field of usefulness once open to this home product.\r\n\r\nBesides the hemps---American, Russian and Italian--another cordage\r\nfiber used to some extent in this country is known as New Zealand hemp\r\nor flax, taking its name from the country where it is produced. This\r\nis not strictly a hemp, although so called like many other fibers. It\r\nis obtained from the leaves of a plant belonging to the lily family,\r\nthe cultivation of which forms an important New Zealand industry. The\r\nextracting of the fiber is done by special machinery and, contrary to\r\nthe former practice, much attention is now given to properly grading\r\nand packing the product, these matters being subject to government\r\ninspection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEMP GROWING BY THE WATER]\r\n\r\nNew Zealand hemp in general appearance resembles Manila more closely\r\nthan does any other cordage fiber, and, although it is far inferior\r\nin strength and other practical qualities, it is sometimes used as an\r\nadulterant in making the cheaper grades of so-called Manila rope. Its\r\npresence in a rope sold for Manila is sometimes difficult to detect,\r\nwhich emphasizes the necessity of care on the part of the buyer in\r\ngetting positive assurance of the purity of the goods offered him.\r\n\r\nThe only other cordage fibers of much consequence are the so-called\r\nAfrican and Java hemps--the first named a product of German East Africa\r\nand of British East Africa, the Java hemp a product of the island of\r\nthe same name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNCLE BEN, HEMP BREAKER]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nPINE TAR\r\n\r\n\r\nWho does not know of the tarred rigging which once meant so much to the\r\nrope-maker? Its very odor seemed to cling to the pages of seafaring\r\nbooks. Its use naturally declined with the development of steam power,\r\nyet how few people, perhaps, realize that tarred goods for quite\r\ndifferent purposes form an important though incidental branch of the\r\nrope business today! Lathyarn--to mention but one class--is consumed\r\nannually by the lumber industry in quantities that would surprise many\r\npersons. Today’s buyers, furthermore, need goods of high quality just\r\nas did the old-time sea captains, and in the manufacture of such goods\r\nthe tar itself is an important factor.\r\n\r\nPine tar--the kind best suited for cordage--comes from various members\r\nof the pine-tree family, and is secured by a distillation process. The\r\nprincipal producing sections are northern Europe and the south-eastern\r\nUnited States--the yellow, long leaf or Georgia pine, which ranks\r\nfirst in this country for tar-making, growing in a territory about one\r\nhundred and twenty-five miles wide along the coast from North Carolina\r\nto Texas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW PINE TAR IS MADE IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC STATES\r\n\r\n  1.

TAR-MAKERS AT HOME\r\n  9. BURNING COMPLETED\r\n]\r\n\r\nOf the two methods for extracting the tar--the old kiln and the modern\r\nretort processes--the second yields the greater supply, largely because\r\nof the more systematic manner in which the industry is carried on. As\r\nyet, however, no way has been perfected for obtaining by this newer\r\nmethod a tar that measures up to Plymouth Cordage Company standards,\r\nand for this reason we have continued to use the kiln-made article only.\r\n\r\nTar-kiln burning is conducted so far out in the country and in such\r\na desultory fashion that few people have the opportunity to become\r\nacquainted with the process. A brief description may, therefore, be of\r\ninterest. Only dead wood is used, as the green tree does not yield the\r\nquality or quantity of tar necessary to make the work profitable. Among\r\nthe tar-makers the material is known as fat lightwood, possibly from\r\nthe fact that it ignites easily and burns rapidly. In weight and color\r\nit is anything but a light wood.\r\n\r\nThe wood is cut into convenient lengths and then laid up, with the\r\nground as a floor, to form a pile about twenty-five feet long by five\r\nhigh and tapering in width from eight to five feet. The soil, if soft\r\nor sandy, is first covered with clay to lessen the loss of tar, and the\r\npile is usually built on a slope so that the liquid will flow toward\r\nthe pipe which serves as an outlet.\r\n\r\nThe kiln is completed by covering the wood with “pine straw” and sand.\r\nThis prevents air currents and keeps the fire, which is on the back\r\nend, from drawing through and consuming the wood without producing tar.\r\nMoreover, while the kiln is burning--a period of two weeks or more for\r\na twenty-five cord pile--it must be watched day and night so that straw\r\nand sand blown off by the gases within may be replaced at once.\r\n\r\nAs the tar comes from the kiln it is caught in a hole dug beneath the\r\noutlet and is dipped up and poured into barrels--the average yield\r\nbeing one barrel to the cord. The tar is then hauled by cart to water\r\nor railroad, thence to be transported to the various naval stores yards.\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing description and the accompanying illustrations of\r\ntar manufacture we are indebted to the American Naval Stores Company.\r\nThe pictures showing kiln operations are very unusual and were secured\r\nonly after several trips. The others were taken at the Company’s yards\r\nat Wilmington, North Carolina, where the tar is carefully inspected,\r\nstrained and then re-barreled for shipment to our two factories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAR HANDLING AT NAVAL STORES YARD\r\n\r\n  1.

Purchasing power and the resources\r\nfor grading and using each bale of fiber with strict regard to its\r\nparticular fitness for his products are also of special value to the\r\nrope manufacturer.\r\n\r\nWe have already shown that Manila fiber or hemp, as it is commonly\r\ncalled, is the principal and for most purposes the best cordage\r\nmaterial. Including the numerous commercial grades and the brands of\r\nindividual packers, the market designations or marks of Manila hemp\r\nrun into the hundreds and cover a wide range in the four important\r\nqualities of strength, texture, length and color. A single mark may,\r\nfurthermore, vary greatly in one quality or another from time to time,\r\nso that the market designation alone is not a safe sign of the fiber’s\r\nfitness for a certain purpose.\r\n\r\nBecause of these facts the only way a manufacturer can be sure of\r\nsufficient fiber of the character required to insure uniform quality\r\nin each of his products is by examining and re-grading, according\r\nto his own standards, the hemp delivered to him and by combining\r\nselections of different marks in the right proportions to give the\r\ndesired results. To do this successfully requires a thorough knowledge\r\nof fibers, large stocks always available and special storage facilities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXAMINING AND RE-GRADING MANILA FIBER]\r\n\r\nThe steadily increasing demand for our products and our large scale\r\nof production warrant our buying yearly more Manila hemp than any\r\nother single manufacturer--more than many combined. Our purchases are\r\ngoverned, furthermore, by the knowledge gained through more than ninety\r\nyears’ experience with the fiber markets and rope-making. These facts\r\nexplain why we are able to secure the choicest marks so consistently\r\nand in such quantity.\r\n\r\nWe have also erected warehouses capable of holding large quantities\r\nof fiber for months at a time so that we can store such as is not\r\nnecessary for our immediate wants. This helps us to take full\r\nadvantage of specially favorable offerings in the fiber markets. In\r\naddition, we maintain a system of fiber examination and classification\r\nby our own experts together with warehouse records that insure each\r\nbale being put to the particular use its quality fits it for.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRACK AND WAREHOUSE FACILITIES, PLYMOUTH CORDAGE COMPANY]\r\n\r\nThe important question of quality is determined when the hemp first\r\nreaches us. The carloads of Manila from Boston, New York, Seattle and\r\nother ports are brought directly alongside our warehouses and after the\r\nhemp has all been transferred to the platforms every mark is carefully\r\ngone over. Bales are opened, the hanks laid out flat, the fiber\r\nminutely examined and each mark given our own grading. This examination\r\nis conducted purely from the manufacturing standpoint and is entirely\r\nin addition to the one made on the dock. The expert ability to judge\r\nfiber and the constant care required can be imagined from the fact\r\nthat single shipments frequently contain as many as seventy-five marks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STACKING MANILA FIBER WITH PORTABLE, COMPRESSED-AIR\r\nENGINE]\r\n\r\nThe weighing and storing of the fiber follow next, and the latter is\r\na task of considerable magnitude, for our warehouses contain a floor\r\nspace of over 370,000 square feet and each mark must be so placed that\r\nit will be readily accessible as needed. When the bales are put on the\r\nscales and an entry made of the weight--always close to 275 pounds on\r\nManila--a record is also set down for each bale which identifies it by\r\nmark, shipment and location in warehouse, according to the section,\r\nbay and hoist selected for it. The hemp is then built up into orderly\r\npiles with the aid of a portable compressed-air engine, each mark being\r\nplaced by itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRUCKING MANILA FIBER INTO FACTORY WAREHOUSE]\r\n\r\nBy means of this warehouse system and the separate record showing\r\nthe proper use for every mark in each shipment, the qualities and\r\nquantities of fiber needed by any mill for the regular day’s work\r\nor for a particular job can be gotten out at a moment’s notice and\r\nwith very small chance of error. As an additional safeguard, however,\r\nagainst accidental use of the wrong lot of fiber, we maintain a\r\nchecking system which would reveal at once any mistake in delivery from\r\nwarehouse to mill.\r\n\r\nThe careful methods we have just described are indicative of the\r\nwatchfulness maintained with each of the many fibers we use, although\r\nin none of them is there as great range of quality as in Manila, nor is\r\npurchasing power so important a factor.\r\n\r\nA recent and interesting development in connection with our Sisal\r\nimportations is the direct steamship service now in effect between\r\nYucatan and North Plymouth, and because of which cargoes of this fiber\r\ncan now be brought directly alongside our own pier, unloaded by our own\r\nemployees and trucked at once into our own warehouse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SISAL FIBER BEING TRANSFERRED FROM WAREHOUSE TO MILL]\r\n\r\nEvery user of rope naturally expects that under equal conditions he\r\nwill receive the same service from one rope that he does from another\r\nof the same kind and size made by the same manufacturer. The Plymouth\r\nCordage Company aims to have each of its products give that sort\r\nof service; first, by possessing the best materials, facilities and\r\nworkmen obtainable; second, by utilizing each of these factors to the\r\nbest advantage.\r\n\r\nThis policy, so well illustrated in our buying and selecting of fiber,\r\nfinds its expression in every phase and department of our business, and\r\nherein lies one of the vital reasons why Plymouth Rope has always been\r\nso popular and is becoming increasingly so among discriminating rope\r\nbuyers.\r\n\r\nSpeedy transfer of the fiber from warehouse to mill is made by an\r\nindustrial railroad operated by compressed air, which carries the bales\r\ndirectly into the various opening rooms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NO. 2 TAR HOUSE, PLYMOUTH CORDAGE COMPANY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REAR VIEW NO. 3 MILL, PLYMOUTH CORDAGE COMPANY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF FIBER FOR SPINNING--FORMATION OF “SLIVER”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opening room where the fiber is made ready for the preparation\r\nmachinery is a reminder of the days when all rope-making processes were\r\nhand work. The bales are first opened up. In the case of Manila this\r\nmeans cutting away the straw matting put on to protect the fiber in\r\nshipment. Then the hanks which are packed in various ways--sometimes\r\ndoubled, sometimes twisted--are taken out and straightened and the band\r\nat the end of each hank removed.\r\n\r\nNo machinery has yet been perfected for doing the work just described,\r\nbut the first of the preparation processes, a short step beyond, tells\r\nquite a different story. Here the hanks of such fibers as require a\r\nspecial cleaning treatment are placed on fast-working hackling machines\r\nwhich comb away most of the snarls, loose tow and dirt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREPARATION ROOM, NO. 3 MILL, PLYMOUTH CORDAGE COMPANY]\r\n\r\nAt this point hard fibers--Manila, Sisal and New Zealand--are usually\r\noiled to soften them and to make them more workable for the operations\r\nthat follow. The oil, furthermore, acts as a preservative. It is a\r\nmatter of importance to the buyer, however, that the fiber should not\r\nbe too heavily oiled, for that merely increases the weight and cost of\r\nthe rope without improving its quality. Our experts have determined\r\nthrough long experience the amount of oil that should be used to best\r\nserve the interests of both manufacturer and buyer, and have perfected\r\na process which insures a perfect distribution over all the fibers,\r\nwhile frequent tests on each machine, in which definite quantities of\r\nfiber are weighed before and after oiling, prevent any excess.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHERE THE LUBRICATING OIL IS MIXED]\r\n\r\nThe quality of oil used is also important, for grades containing acids\r\nhave a harmful effect on all vegetable fiber. We compound our own oils\r\nand we also take great care to prevent acids from entering our grounds\r\nor factories and so coming in contact with our products.\r\n\r\nLong ago the Plymouth Cordage Company learned that in the methods\r\nemployed in the preparation of fiber for spinning lay one of the\r\nsecrets of fine rope-making. To secure a more effective and special\r\ntreatment in this process, we have added to the regular machines many\r\nimprovements of our own. So highly perfected is the apparatus that\r\nby machine work entirely the separate hanks of fiber are combed and\r\nelongated into a soft, continuous sliver of any size desired and of\r\nconvenient length, glossy in appearance, perfectly clean, and with each\r\nfiber lying as nearly as possible in the straight position which gives\r\nit maximum strength. These operations, in which the entire character of\r\nthe comparatively short vegetable fiber changes seemingly, are wholly a\r\ndevelopment of modern rope-making, since in the days of hand spinning\r\nno sliver was necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORMATION OF SLIVER--FIRST BREAKER]\r\n\r\nThe machines are arranged in series, usually as follows: a first and\r\nsecond breaker, a coarse and a fine spreader and a draw frame. The\r\ntreatment is varied to suit the particular requirements of different\r\nhemps or ropes by a prolonging or shortening of the series and by the\r\nadjusting of individual machines, but the method is always essentially\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECOND BREAKER\r\n\r\nSPREADER\r\n\r\nDRAW FRAME\r\n\r\nREDUCING SIZE OF SLIVER FOR SPINNING]\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the first breaker is to form the primary sliver or\r\n“roping” as it is sometimes called. The hanks of fiber--somewhat matted\r\nif they have been oiled--are fed by hand into the machine, several at a\r\ntime. Steel pins fitted to a slowly revolving endless chain grasp the\r\nmass while a second set of pins, moving more rapidly, draws out the\r\nindividual fibers and combs them into a continuous form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROUP OF DRAW FRAMES]\r\n\r\nThe operations which follow are very similar. A number of “ropings” are\r\nallowed to feed together into a first, slowly revolving set of pins\r\nand are drawn out again by a high-speed set into a smaller sliver, the\r\npins becoming finer on each succeeding machine until the draw frame is\r\nreached. Here the fiber is pulled from a single set of pins between two\r\nrapidly moving leather belts called aprons. On all of these machines\r\nthe fiber passes between rollers as it goes onto and leaves the pins\r\nand the sliver is given its cylindrical form by being drawn through a\r\ncircular opening.\r\n\r\nA finished sliver must conform to the special size desired for\r\nspinning. Different sizes are secured by changing the number of\r\n“ropings” which are allowed to feed into the fine spreader. When “rule\r\nof thumb” standards of measurement were practiced the size of the\r\nsliver was tested by the number of turns which could be clasped in the\r\nhand between the ends of the thumb and forefinger. If the workman’s\r\nhand chanced to be different from the official hand, he made allowances\r\naccordingly. At best this was a rough and ready method, but through\r\nlong practice the men could become surprisingly expert. Mechanical\r\ngrips or clasps are now used because they are more convenient and\r\nafford greater accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe wonder of modernism in rope-making is nowhere more striking than\r\nin the preparation room. To pass from one end, where the raw hemp is\r\nreceived just as it left the hands of the native Filipino laborer with\r\nhis crude methods, down through the long rows of machines to the draw\r\nframes from which the sliver is delivered in a form that can be likened\r\nto a stream of molten metal, is to cover decades of inventive genius\r\nand mechanical development.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism performs its work so accurately that at first glance the\r\nman feeding the fiber into the machine and all the other men, busy\r\nabout their various duties, would appear to be playing very minor parts\r\nin modern rope-making. In reality, expert workmanship and watchfulness\r\nare very important factors. Good rope depends no more upon scientific\r\nmachine processes than upon ceaseless attention to the little details.\r\nAnd the attention paid to the details of the preparation room is\r\nespecially important.\r\n\r\nA rope expert once said, “Any manufacturer can make rope--it is a\r\nsimple operation; but very few can make _good rope_ because few are\r\nwilling to devote the necessary amount of pains to each of the little\r\noperations in the process.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLYMOUTH CORDAGE COMPANY FACTORY TODAY AND IN EARLY\r\nDAYS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nSPINNING OF ROPE YARN AND BINDER TWINE\r\n\r\n\r\nHand spinning, as practiced in the early days of the Plymouth Cordage\r\nCompany, yielded a remarkably good rope yarn, but large production\r\nwas very expensive and laborious. The length of the spinning grounds,\r\nwhich with the buildings protecting them were known as the ropewalk,\r\ndetermined the length yarn that could be spun. Hand and water power had\r\nto suffice, and even the best spinner could make but two yarns at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nSteam-driven spinning machines were introduced, however, as early as\r\n1838, for our records show that near the close of that year Bourne\r\nSpooner, founder of our company, wrote to one of the directors as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “Our new spinning concern has consumed more time in the work of\r\n    preparation than was expected, but we are now ready--this being\r\n    the second day of steam spinning. It affords me much gratification\r\n    to say that everything connected with this enterprise has gone\r\n    comfortably on, and my faith in the utility and expediency of the\r\n    measure is unabated.”\r\n\r\nThrough the courtesy of the Watson Machine Co. of Paterson, N. J.,\r\nwe are able to show an excellent picture of one of these earlier-type\r\nmachines which, it will be noted, is tended by a woman. Those familiar\r\nonly with the present factory practice of putting none but men on the\r\nspinning machines may be surprised to know that during this first\r\nperiod in the modern development of the process women spinners were\r\nregularly employed by the Plymouth Cordage Company and other concerns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPINNING ON EARLY-TYPE MACHINE]\r\n\r\nOur founder’s belief in the new method was speedily justified. A way\r\nwas found to adapt the machines to the spinning of Russian and American\r\nhemps which could not at first be handled as successfully as Manila\r\nbecause of their somewhat softer texture. About 1848 the self-feeding\r\ndevice came into use. As the years passed, still other improvements\r\nwere invented and utilized, giving us the highly perfected machine of\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nUnder favorable working conditions the only interruption in the\r\nspinning process, as now carried on, is the removal of the full bobbin\r\nand the substitution of an empty one. A bobbin will hold as much\r\nas half a mile of yarn which will weigh in the neighborhood of ten\r\npounds--the length and weight of the load varying with different sizes\r\nof yarn.\r\n\r\nThe feed portion of the machine, as can be seen in the picture below,\r\nconsists of a revolving endless chain fitted with fine steel pins, and\r\nby these the fiber--now in the sliver form given it in the preparation\r\nroom--is drawn from its bundle and carried toward a tube which can be\r\nadjusted to regulate the size of the yarn as desired. Into this tube\r\nthe fiber disappears in a fashion only to be described by the single\r\nword “whisked.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MODERN SPINNING PROCESS]\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter we spoke of the importance of an even sliver\r\nin the securing of a good yarn and pointed out the care with which our\r\nsliver is prepared. We have still further lessened the possibility of\r\nbunches or thin spots in our yarns by perfecting and installing on all\r\nspinning machines a device which insures a uniform amount of feed to\r\nthe tube at all times.\r\n\r\nThe two capstans which pull the fiber from the pins and through the\r\ntube show in our picture directly at the left of the bobbin. Their\r\nrevolution also imparts the twist to the yarn. The amount of this\r\ntwist--the number of turns per foot--depends on the capstan’s speed and\r\nis fixed in a way best explained by describing the flyer--the first\r\npart of the machine to be perfected.\r\n\r\nThe closed flyer, as the present-day type is called, is composed of\r\ntwo discs joined by stay rods and carrying through their centers a\r\nspindle which holds the wooden bobbin. The capstans are set into the\r\ndisc at the left and revolve with the flyer, at the same time receiving\r\na lesser reverse power from an independent gearing. Their speed is,\r\ntherefore, equivalent to the difference in speeds of these two drivers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “WITH ITS HUNDREDS OF FLYERS.” SPINNING ROOM, NO. 1 MILL]\r\n\r\nTo insure an even twist these speeds, once they are set, should not\r\nbe allowed to vary, and to obtain this steady running, the Plymouth\r\nCordage Company uses, almost entirely, machines of a special type, so\r\nconstructed as to guarantee the best possible results.\r\n\r\nBinder twine is always given what is known as a right-hand twist, but\r\nrope yarns must, for certain kinds of rope, be given a left-hand twist.\r\nThis is accomplished by reversing the direction of the capstans. The\r\nflyer carries four grooved wheels--two for the right, the others for\r\nthe left-hand yarn--and by these the yarn is guided from the capstans\r\nto the revolving bobbin.\r\n\r\nThe spinning room, with its hundreds of flyers, each running in the\r\nneighborhood of 1,500 revolutions a minute, speaks eloquently of the\r\nyears’ changes. Gone is the “drowsy dreamy sound” of the wheel in\r\nLongfellow’s “Ropewalk,” and in its place we hear the high singing\r\nnoise of the gears--the voice of modern industry. And with the changes\r\nhave come more rapid and economical production, better hours and pay\r\nfor the workman, better rope for the consumer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPINNING ROOM, NO. 3 MILL, PLYMOUTH CORDAGE COMPANY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATFORM AND APPARATUS FOR STORAGE AND HANDLING OF TAR\r\nSUPPLY, PLYMOUTH CORDAGE COMPANY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTARRING OF ROPE YARNS AND OF SMALL ROPES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter we described the spinning of rope yarn. Let us now\r\nturn to the process where, for certain ropes, this yarn is treated with\r\nthe tar, the manufacture of which we have already discussed.\r\n\r\nTo penetrate and adhere to the yarn the tar must be heated to 200° or\r\nover. This work is begun in tanks from which the liquid feeds into\r\nthe long copper-lined troughs where the tarring takes place. Through\r\nthese “coppers,” so called, run steam pipes to further regulate the\r\ntemperature. Excessive heating would cause the loss of the tar’s good\r\nqualities, and to prevent this the supply in the “coppers” must be\r\nfreshened frequently.\r\n\r\nThe picture on the next page illustrates how the yarns unwind from the\r\nbobbins, onto which they have been wound in the spinning process, and\r\npass on into the “copper.” The plates which keep the yarns under the\r\ntar are shown elevated above the surface to give a clearer idea of\r\ntheir operation. As the heavily saturated yarns come from the “copper,”\r\nthey are compressed between two rollers, adjusted to leave in the yarn\r\nas much or as little tar as needed for the particular goods being made\r\nand to turn back the surplus.\r\n\r\nThe pull which carries the yarn through the tar and between the rollers\r\ncomes from two large drums around which the yarns travel preparatory to\r\nreeling onto friction-driven receiving bobbins.\r\n\r\nGoods of nine-thread size and under are usually tarred in the completed\r\nrope form, but the process is essentially the same as with the yarns.\r\n\r\nVisitors to our tar-houses frequently remark upon the rich golden brown\r\nof our tarred goods. Those who use and sell them have come to look upon\r\nthat color--an outward sign of right materials and methods--as the\r\nPlymouth mark of the weather-resisting qualities contained in the goods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YARNS ENTERING THE “COPPER”]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nFORMING AND LAYING OF ROPES AND CABLES--ROPEWALK METHOD\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore taking up the strictly modern machines so largely used now in\r\nthe final processes of rope-making--the forming of strands, laying of\r\ncommon ropes and closing of cable-laid goods--we shall describe the\r\nropewalk method of performing these operations as it is practised today.\r\n\r\nFor making tarred goods in all but the smaller sizes the walk has\r\ncertain advantages not afforded by more advanced methods. It also\r\nprovides efficient equipment for turning out the largest ropes, which\r\nwould otherwise require special machinery.\r\n\r\nThe long alleys or grounds where the work takes place are usually laid\r\nout in pairs, one for forming, the other for laying and closing. Each\r\nground has a track to accommodate the machines and an endless band-rope\r\nwhich conveys the power.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the forming ground stand frames holding the bobbins of\r\nyarn. The yarns for each strand first pass through a plate perforated\r\nin concentric circles. This arrangement gives each yarn the correct\r\nangle of delivery into a tube where the whole mass gets a certain\r\namount of compression.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORDAGE MANUFACTURE BY THE ROPEWALK METHOD\r\n\r\nYARNS PASSING FROM BOBBINS THROUGH PERFORATED PLATES\r\n\r\n  “TOP TRUCK”--LAYING PROCESS      FORMING MACHINE--MAKING STRAND\r\n\r\nCLOSING TARRED RUSSIAN HEMP CABLE 15¾″ CIRCUMFERENCE FOR ARGENTINE\r\nBATTLESHIP “RIVADAVIA”]\r\n\r\nThe forming machine--a heavy carriage surmounted by the band-rope wheel\r\ninto which are geared several spindles and a driving drum--is now drawn\r\nup, and each group of yarns is attached to a separate spindle as shown\r\nopposite. A rope made fast at either end of the walk is given a few\r\nturns around the drum, the band-rope is set in motion and the machine\r\nmoves off, leaving in its wake the compactly twisted strands.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a common right-laid rope, the forming twist is left\r\nhand. A change to right hand can be made simply by shifting clutches.\r\nThe amount of turn or twist depends on the diameter of the drum, which\r\nis adjustable.\r\n\r\nBehind the machine follows a man who swings out the stakes, placed\r\nat intervals along the walk, and throws the strands over them. When\r\nthe process is completed the strands are cut away at either end and\r\ntransferred to the laying ground, the stakes being pushed back to allow\r\nthe return of the forming machine for another trip.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF ROPEWALK, PLYMOUTH CORDAGE COMPANY]\r\n\r\nThe two laying machines stationed at opposite ends of the walk greatly\r\nresemble the forming machine. One--usually the “afterturn,” so\r\ncalled--is made fast; the other, or “foreturn,” is braked down but not\r\nsecured. The strands are attached to separate spindles on each machine\r\nand given a little extra twisting from both ends--left hand as in the\r\nforming. During this process of putting in the “hard,” so called, as\r\nwell as in the laying itself, the foreturn machine is drawn slowly\r\nahead by the shortening of the strands.\r\n\r\nFor the laying, the ends of the strands at the afterturn machine\r\nare transferred to a single spindle. The “top”--a cone-shaped\r\nblock containing a groove for each strand and mounted on a light\r\ntruck--is backed up to the machine, the strands are inserted and the\r\ntwisting recommenced, the direction of the afterturn spindles now\r\nbeing reversed. The resulting tendency of the strands to untwist\r\nis counteracted, partly by a left-hand revolution of the foreturn\r\nspindles, and partly by the presence of the “hard” or surplus twist\r\njust described.\r\n\r\nAs the top truck is forced ahead by the twisting process, the\r\nrope-maker preserves a correct lay in the rope by means of greater or\r\nless leverage on the “tails”--the loose ropes shown in our picture. The\r\nstakes on which the strands rest are removed one by one to allow the\r\ntop truck to pass and are then replaced to support the rope until the\r\nlaying is finished and the reeling in of the rope begun.\r\n\r\nThe closing process on cable-laid goods is like the laying except\r\nthat the twist is reversed. The work being with three complete\r\nropes--frequently very large--a heavier top truck is necessary, and\r\nthis must often be ballasted, as shown in our illustration on page 80,\r\nto keep down the vibration which would otherwise tend to lift the truck\r\noff the track.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIXTEEN-INCH TOWLINE WITH EYE-SPLICE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LATHYARN AND TIE ROPE MACHINES, NO. 2 TAR HOUSE,\r\nPLYMOUTH CORDAGE COMPANY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nFORMING AND LAYING OF ROPES AND CABLES--FACTORY METHOD, TWO-MACHINE\r\nSYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike the ropewalk system of making strands, ropes and cables\r\ndescribed in the preceding chapter, the factory method, so called, is a\r\ndevelopment of the last few decades only. From the first this company\r\nhas been a leader in purchasing the best stock machines obtainable and\r\nin designing devices to fulfill special requirements--a policy which\r\nhas given us unequalled production facilities.\r\n\r\nTo describe this equipment in detail would require an entire book. We\r\nshall attempt, in this chapter and the next, to give an idea of the\r\nprincipal machines only.\r\n\r\nThere are two methods to the modern system: that in which the strands\r\nare formed on one type of machine and twisted into a rope on another;\r\nand that in which both operations are performed on a single machine.\r\nThe second method carries with it the advantage of economy in space and\r\nequipment, but is not followed so generally with the larger sizes of\r\nrope as is the first.\r\n\r\nA complete set for the two-part method comprises two or more\r\nhorizontal strand-forming machines, several bobbin frames and a\r\nvertical laying-machine. In our illustration, the latter is shown\r\nmaking three ropes into a cable--a process essentially the same as\r\nwhere three strands are united into a single rope.\r\n\r\nThree men usually suffice on the strand-making--one to tend the\r\nmachines, the others to tend the bobbins which turn on fixed posts and\r\ncan be renewed as needed without interrupting the process.\r\n\r\nThe yarns are first drawn from the bobbins through the perforated\r\nplates seen in the lower section of the picture, the entire number\r\nbeing so distributed as to converge in layers and at the proper angles\r\naround one central yarn. They next pass into a tube. Here the whole\r\nmass is compressed and at the same time is twisted by the revolution\r\nof the long carriage or flyer, which, as our picture shows, supports a\r\nwinding-reel and two capstans.\r\n\r\nThe strand can be twisted right or left hand as called for. The amount\r\nof twist is regulated by the flyer’s speed--easily varied by the use of\r\ndifferent gears.\r\n\r\nThe two capstans are geared to pull the strand through the tube and,\r\nby holding it taut, keep the twist uniform. The reel also has its\r\nseparate gears and revolution. Whenever the increasing diameter of the\r\nload tends to make it exert too much strain on the strand, the reel is\r\nslowed down by an ingenious friction device. The strand is guided into\r\neven layers on the reel by an arm which is made to travel from side to\r\nside.\r\n\r\nHere, then, are four distinct operations going on at once and all in\r\nperfect harmony. From this may be judged the many difficulties which\r\nhad to be overcome before strands could be manufactured in such small\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORIZONTAL FORMING MACHINES MAKING STRANDS\r\n\r\nVERTICAL LAYING-MACHINE MAKING OIL-WELL CABLE\r\n\r\nFORMING MACHINES (WINDING REEL ON FARTHER MACHINE REMOVED)\r\n\r\nROPE-MAKING MACHINERY, PLYMOUTH CORDAGE COMPANY]\r\n\r\nThe illustration opposite page 85 shows the machines which make\r\nPlymouth Lathyarn and Hide Rope. Although somewhat smaller than the\r\ntype just described, these machines are constructed and operate in\r\npractically the same manner. The speed of their flyers is naturally\r\nmuch slower, however, since the goods they work on need not be twisted\r\nso hard as a rope strand.\r\n\r\nFor the laying process, in which the strands are united to make a\r\nrope, the full reels are removed from the forming machines by overhead\r\nchains, as shown on the opposite page, and by like means are placed in\r\nthe vertical flyers of the laying-machine. The strands pass through\r\nopenings in the top-piece just above the flyers and converge into a\r\ncentral tube still higher up to form the rope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REMOVING REEL WITH STRAND FROM FORMING MACHINE]\r\n\r\nWhen the machine is in operation the whole lower portion, from the tube\r\ndown, revolves, either to the right or left as the goods require, and\r\nthus puts the twist into the rope. This twist being opposite, always,\r\nto that of the strands, the natural tendency of the latter as they are\r\nlaid together would be to loosen up. To regulate this, each flyer is\r\nmade to revolve on its own axis--in a direction opposite to the general\r\ndirection of the machine. Each reel revolves also on its axis to feed\r\nout the strand--the effect of the changing load being met as before by\r\na friction attachment.\r\n\r\nThe overhead pulleys, which perform the same mission for the rope that\r\nthe capstans previously did for the strands, deliver the finished\r\nproduct onto a belt-driven coiling reel where it is guided into even\r\nlayers by the workman tending the machine.\r\n\r\nAs already explained, the laying-machine is used in the same way when\r\nthree ropes are made into a cable. When a four-strand rope is to be\r\nturned out the machine has four strand-reels. If the strands are\r\nto be laid around a heart rope, as in transmission goods, the heart\r\nfeeds directly into the twist tube from a smaller reel placed on the\r\ntop-piece previously mentioned.\r\n\r\nAll the foregoing machines are equipped with ingenious devices for\r\nmeasuring the strand or rope as it is made, so that the attendant\r\ncan tell instantly from the gauge how many feet have been run. The\r\nfeatures we have here touched on are only a few of the many that\r\nhave transformed the final stages of rope-making from a laborious\r\ntask--dependent for its success on the skill of the individual\r\nexpert--into quick, sure operations where every problem is met with the\r\nunfailing accuracy of a perfect machine. Rope nowadays is, generally\r\nspeaking, made more scientifically, more uniformly than it was in the\r\ndays of strictly hand processes. And the end is not yet. Better and\r\nstill better rope should mark the years to come.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOUR-STRAND COMPOUND LAYING-MACHINE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nFORMING AND LAYING OF ROPES--FACTORY METHOD, SINGLE-MACHINE SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nModern rope-making ingenuity reaches its high-water mark in the\r\ncompound laying-machine where the two operations of forming the strands\r\nand laying them into a rope are combined. Up to a certain point this\r\nmethod is more economical than that in which the forming and laying\r\nare unconnected as already described. Fewer machines are required\r\nfor a given output,--hence less floor space and fewer workmen. The\r\ntime-saving element also enters in.\r\n\r\nThe compound laying-machine must, however, be stopped each time that\r\nthe supply of yarn on any bobbin is so low as to call for a fresh one.\r\nThis would occur so frequently in the case of the larger ropes as to\r\noffset the advantages just mentioned, and the machine is therefore used\r\non a limited range of sizes only.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen in the picture opposite, the machine contains a\r\nvertical shaft with upper and lower projecting arms which support the\r\nbobbin-flyers--four in number in this particular case. The bobbins\r\nwithin each flyer turn on separate spindles, allowing the yarns to\r\npass up through small guide plates and thence into a tube.\r\n\r\nEach flyer is geared to revolve on its own axis, thus twisting its set\r\nof yarns into a compact strand. At the same time all the flyers revolve\r\nwith the main shaft in an opposite direction and form a rope out of the\r\nstrands as the latter come together in a central tube still higher up.\r\n\r\nThe rope is drawn through this tube by a series of pulleys which exert\r\na steady pull and so keep the proper twist in the rope. From these\r\npulleys the finished product is delivered onto a separately driven\r\ncoiling reel, an automatic device registering meanwhile on a dial the\r\nnumber of feet run.\r\n\r\nThe small reel, seen near the head of the main shaft, holds the small\r\nheart rope which is fed into the center of certain four-strand ropes to\r\nact as a bed for the strands.\r\n\r\nThe compound laying-machine can be had in many sizes of differing\r\nbobbin capacity, and the extent and variety of a manufacturer’s\r\nequipment on this type is one important indication of his ability to\r\nturn out promptly and at a reasonable price the sizes of rope in most\r\ncommon demand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHIPPING PLATFORM, PLYMOUTH CORDAGE COMPANY]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE UNIVERSITY PRESS\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE MASS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nPunctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made consistent when a\r\npredominant preference was found in the original book; otherwise they\r\nwere not changed.\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors were corrected; unbalanced quotation\r\nmarks were remedied when the change was obvious, and otherwise left\r\nunbalanced.\r\n\r\nIllustrations in this eBook have been positioned between paragraphs\r\nand outside quotations.
