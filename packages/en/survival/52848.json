Except for the meteorites, scientists have to depend\r\nentirely on studies of some form of _radiation_ for all their knowledge\r\nof the wider cosmos lying outside of the atmosphere of the earth. And\r\nnone of the radiations reaching us from various sources afar can be held\r\nin the hand for examination. Each type of radiant energy incident upon\r\nour earth—whether that energy be light from the sun or from the more\r\ndistant stars or the galaxies, or the reflected light from the planets\r\nand moons of our Solar System, or the less familiar forms of radiation,\r\nsuch as radio waves and cosmic rays—must be measured and permanently\r\nrecorded by complicated instruments. Often the results given by even the\r\nmost sensitive and tractable of these scientific robots turn out to be\r\nexceedingly difficult for man, their master, to interpret.\r\n\r\nBut the meteorites require no such temperamental instruments for their\r\nmeasurement. They are themselves a permanent record. They can be\r\nweighed, sectioned, and polished. They can be studied chemically,\r\nmicroscopically, and radiometrically. In fact, they can be investigated\r\n_directly_, just as they are themselves, in our hands, by any method\r\nmodern science may be clever enough to devise.\r\n\r\nThis is why, now with the world’s attention drawn to ambitious plans for\r\nthe exploration of the cosmos, meteors and meteorites are of increasing\r\ninterest and importance.\r\n\r\nWe have planned and written this book to be a sound and yet largely\r\nnontechnical introduction to the science of meteoritics. Our daily\r\nexperiences in the Institute of Meteoritics have afforded us a fortunate\r\nadvantage in making such a presentation. For, in addition to our work in\r\nthe field, laboratory, and classrooms, we have frequently conducted\r\nyoung people through the museum and workrooms of the Institute and so\r\nhave had the opportunity of learning their point of view at the same\r\ntime they were venturing into ours. We hope our book will instill in the\r\nreader an abiding interest in the location and protection, the recovery\r\nand preservation and especially in the study of those cosmic missiles of\r\niron, iron-stone, or stony composition that represent mankind’s only\r\nponderable links with the vast universe lying beyond the limits of the\r\nearth’s atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAlthough all photographs and special depictions not made by our staff\r\nare individually credited, we wish to express our personal thanks for\r\nthe privilege of reprinting them here.

I. Medvedev.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              1. A METEORITE FALLS IN THE TAIGA, U.S.S.R.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning of February 12, 1947, dawned cold but bright and sunny in\r\nthe wide Ussuri valley of Eastern Siberia. During the early morning\r\nhours the people in the villages went about their everyday chores as\r\nusual. Farmers fed and watered their livestock, while housewives tidied\r\nrooms and fired up stoves for heating and baking. Miners went to work\r\ndeep underground. An artist seated himself outdoors near his home to\r\nmake exercise sketches. In a densely wooded area on the slopes of a\r\nnearby mountain range, a logging crew began a day’s timber-cutting.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, at 10:35 a.m., an extraordinarily large and brilliant fireball\r\nflashed above the central part of the mountain range. It streaked across\r\nthe sky in less than 5 seconds and disappeared beyond the western\r\nfoothills of the range. Then the inhabitants of a wide area heard what\r\nseemed to them a mighty thunderclap followed by a powerful roar like an\r\nartillery cannonade. Many people felt a strong airwave. (Field parties\r\nlater found that those who noticed this effect were quite close to the\r\nplace where the meteorite fell.)\r\n\r\nFor several hours afterward, a large black column of smoke tinged with a\r\nreddish-rose color stood above the place of fall. Gradually, this cloud\r\nspread outward, became curved and then zigzag in form, and finally\r\nvanished toward the end of the day.\r\n\r\nThe flash of the fireball and the loud noises that followed it caused\r\npanic among the farm animals. Cows lowed mournfully and herds of goats\r\nscattered in every direction, chickens and other fowl squawked in alarm,\r\nand dogs ran whining for shelter or crouched against the legs of their\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\nIn the villages, the airwave blew snow off the roofs of houses and other\r\nbuildings, while the strong earth-shocks opened windows and made doors\r\nswing ajar. Housewives were dismayed to see glass windowpanes shattered\r\nin their frames and burning coals and firebrands jolted out of the\r\nwood-burning stoves.\r\n\r\nEven deep in the mineshaft, the vibrations in the air were strong enough\r\nto snuff out the miners’ lamps, leaving the men in darkness.\r\n\r\nOn seeing the huge fireball streak across the sky, the artist put aside\r\nhis practice sketch and began a picture of the display before his\r\nimpressions of it could fade. His painting of this natural event is now\r\nfamous. Not only is it on display in scientific museums all around the\r\nworld, but a color reproduction of it has been issued in Russia as a\r\npostage stamp.\r\n\r\nThe forester supervising the logging crew reported that his attention\r\nwas first attracted to the sky when he noticed a strange “second” shadow\r\nrotating rapidly about the tree that cast it. On looking up, he saw a\r\nblindingly bright fireball, twice as large as the sun, a fiery globe\r\nthat threw off multicolored sparks as it passed. Not long after the\r\nfireball disappeared behind the trees, the forester heard a loud noise\r\nlike nearby cannonading and saw a large dark-colored cloud—later tinged\r\nwith red—billow up over the impact point. (The members of the logging\r\ncrew were among the very few persons actually abroad near the place of\r\nfall. It turned out that they were only about 9 miles from it.)\r\n\r\nAs soon as the many eyewitnesses of the fireball had recovered from\r\ntheir fright, the questions almost everyone asked were “What could it\r\nhave been?” and “Where did it come down?” To answer the first question\r\nwas not as difficult as to answer the second. Local scientists in\r\nVladivostok and Khabarovsk, the nearest cities of some size, suspected\r\nfrom the first that a very large meteorite fall had occurred. But\r\nexactly where? All they could be certain of was that the impact point\r\nlay in the Ussuri taiga, a formidable wilderness.\r\n\r\nThe Sikhote-Alin mountains lie along the Siberian coast between the Sea\r\nof Japan and the Tatar Strait. The Ussuri taiga is a vast, low-lying,\r\nmarshy, densely forested region fronting the western flanks of these\r\nmountains. Ordinary cedars, pines, oaks, and aspen grow in the taiga,\r\nbut the region is also noted for such rare plants and trees as the\r\ncelebrated ginseng, the cork tree, the Greek nut tree, and the black\r\nbirch. Wild grape and ivy vines intertwine the upper branches of the\r\nthick forest, and the trunks of the trees themselves rise from an almost\r\nimpenetrable maze of brush and downed timber.\r\n\r\nSo dense is the forest that in summer, a man can see no more than 10 or\r\n12 feet in any direction. Yet in winter, the explorer’s lot is no\r\neasier; for, although the deciduous trees then stand leafless, the\r\nground is covered by three feet or more of snow. And in the early fall,\r\nviolent cloudbursts often flood the taiga, making travel impossible.\r\n\r\nSuch was the inhospitable region in which the Ussuri, or (as it is now\r\nknown in the U.S.S.R.) Sikhote-Alin meteorite, had chanced to fall. For\r\nany search parties traveling on the ground, the likelihood that they\r\ncould find the fallen meteorite in that wilderness would have been very\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nThe impact point of the Ussuri meteorite was discovered in the only way\r\nreally practical: from the air. Fortunately, the center of impact lay\r\nalmost directly below the airlane connecting the towns of Iman and\r\nUlunga, so that the devastation produced by the meteorite fall in the\r\ntaiga was clearly visible to aviators following this active air route.\r\n\r\nThe accounts several fliers gave concerning the widespread cratering and\r\ndestruction they had seen from the air in the impact area led to the\r\norganization of two separate ground-search parties, one at Khabarovsk,\r\nthe other at Vladivostok. The Khabarovsk group, made up of four members\r\nof the Geological Society, flew to the village of Kharkovo, the\r\ninhabited point nearest the site of fall. After a rough and dangerous\r\nlanding on the small, snow-covered airfield at Kharkovo, the geologists\r\nbegan their trek into the taiga on foot. Throughout the entire trip, the\r\nmen, burdened with supplies and equipment, waded through waist-deep snow\r\nand camped in the open despite the arctic cold.\r\n\r\nAt almost the same time, a geologist from Vladivostok set out from the\r\nrailway line up the Ussuri valley to track down the fallen meteorite.\r\nHis progress was even more difficult than that of the Khabarovsk party.\r\nIn addition to following a much longer route, he did not have the\r\ninvaluable information that the first party had got from the aviators.\r\nHe had to make his way slowly from village to village, questioning\r\neyewitnesses as he went and gradually determining the probable end-point\r\nof the meteorite fall.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:                              COURTESY OF E. L. KRINOV\r\n     Splintered and broken trees at the site of the Ussuri fall.]\r\n\r\nThe route followed by the Vladivostok geologist lay through the heart of\r\nthe trackless snow-covered taiga. Fortunately, he had with him two\r\nhunters who were well acquainted with the rigors of travel through the\r\ntaiga and knew how to live off the land.\r\n\r\nThey slept in hunters’ huts or under overhanging trees, drank melted\r\nsnow water, and ate fried quail. But they had not gone far when they\r\nfound that their footwear was completely useless for a trek through the\r\nwet, snowy taiga, because their felt hiking boots quickly soaked up\r\nwater and became very heavy. So they swathed their feet in warm dry\r\ngrass over which they tied large pieces of untanned leather. After that,\r\nthe walking was much easier. They were able to cover the ground so\r\nrapidly that they reached Kharkovo only a day after the Khabarovsk\r\ngeologists had landed there at the small airfield.\r\n\r\nAt Kharkovo, the three feasted on pork, milk, and honey. Then loading a\r\nfew provisions on a borrowed horse, they started out to overtake the\r\nKhabarovsk party. They made such good time that the two groups were able\r\nto join forces and to enter the impact area as one expedition, on\r\nFebruary 24, 1947.\r\n\r\nA scene of great desolation awaited them in the central region of the\r\nmeteorite fall. Masses of crushed stone had been hurled hundreds of feet\r\nby the violent impact. Denuded, uprooted trees lay about—some cut in two\r\nas neatly as if by a saw. Large cedars had been splintered where they\r\nstood or had been torn up by the roots and thrown some scores of yards.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:                              COURTESY OF E. L. KRINOV\r\n     Workmen excavating one of the large craters formed by the impact of\r\n    the Ussuri meteorites.]\r\n\r\nMost impressive of all, though, were the numerous meteorite craters\r\nranging in size from small bowl-like features to a basin more than 28\r\nyards across and over 6 yards deep—a depression large enough to hold a\r\ntwo-story house. The investigators recovered many fragments of the iron\r\nmeteorite that had broken to pieces not far above the earth’s surface\r\nand had peppered the area of fall with high-speed meteoritic “shrapnel.”\r\n\r\nWith their meteorite recoveries and photographs of the cratered area,\r\nthe members of this first expedition returned to their respective towns\r\nand began a campaign by letter and wire to interest the Moscow office of\r\nthe Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. in making a full-scale\r\ninvestigation of the Ussuri fall. The officials of the Academy decided\r\nat once to send a special scientific expedition to the site of the\r\nmeteorite fall.\r\n\r\nA member of this later and better-equipped expedition compared the\r\nUssuri crater field to a bombed-out area. In fact, some of the meteorite\r\nspecimens were fragments that closely resembled pieces of shattered\r\nshell-casing. The edges of these fragments were jagged and bent, and\r\ntheir surfaces, which often displayed a rainbow-colored sheen, were\r\ngrooved and scarred by impact against the hard rock underlying the\r\nregion in which the crater field had been formed. In rare instances, the\r\ninvestigators noted spiral twisting of the fragments, an indication of\r\nthe unusually violent disruptive forces to which they had been subjected\r\nat impact.\r\n\r\nThe scientists found several instances in which fist-sized meteorite\r\nfragments had actually penetrated into or through standing tree trunks,\r\neither becoming imbedded in the wood or driving a hole right through the\r\ntrunk.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:                              COURTESY OF E. L. KRINOV\r\n     A nickel-iron meteorite from the Ussuri fall imbedded in the trunk\r\n    of a cedar tree.]\r\n\r\nMany whole individual meteorites also were recovered. These were almost\r\nalways covered by a thin, smooth “glaze” known as _fusion crust_. This\r\ncrust forms on the surface of a meteorite as it plunges rapidly through\r\nthe air. The heat generated during its flight causes the outer “skin” of\r\nthe meteorite to melt. Later, when the mass has cooled off, the thin\r\ncoating of melted material hardens, forming a rind or crust.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of 1951, the Russians had sent three more expeditions\r\nto the site of the Ussuri fall. Their scientists found, in all, 122\r\ncraters (the largest more than 80 feet in diameter) as well as numerous\r\nfunnels resulting from the penetration of smaller meteorites into the\r\nearth. By means of both visual and instrumental searches, they also\r\nrecovered 20,000 meteoritic fragments and individual meteorites. The\r\nsmallest Ussuri specimens weighed no more than the thousandth part of a\r\ngram. (There are 453.59 grams in a pound.) Some of these tiny masses\r\nwere found lying cupped in leaves. The largest individual meteorite\r\nrecovered weighed about 3,839 pounds. Altogether, approximately 23 tons\r\nof meteoritic material from the Ussuri fall are now in the collection of\r\nthe Meteorite Committee of the Academy of Sciences, Moscow, while\r\nanother 47 tons are believed to still be buried in the Ussuri crater\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:                              COURTESY OF E. L. KRINOV\r\n     An individual Ussuri meteorite with fusion crust and characteristic\r\n    surface sculpturing produced during high-speed flight through the\r\n    resisting atmosphere.]\r\n\r\nThe Russian scientists carefully mapped the locations of the individual\r\ncraters, penetration funnels, and meteorite recoveries. They made\r\ngeologic and magnetometric surveys of the crater field, took aerial\r\nphotographs of the entire area of fall, and prepared a documentary\r\nmotion-picture covering the activities of the various expeditions. The\r\narea of the crater field has been set aside by the Russian government as\r\na sort of scientific preserve, and is being made into the equivalent of\r\nwhat is termed a National Monument in the U.S.A. Several of the typical\r\ncraters are protected by overroofed shelters to preserve these features\r\nfor generations yet to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             2. A METEORITE FALLS IN THE WHEATLAND, U.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary 18, 1948, had been a pleasant day in northwestern Kansas and as\r\nthe supper hour approached, the sky remained blue and cloudless. Shortly\r\nbefore 5:00 p.m., a few people were still out of doors. An eleven-year\r\nold girl was hanging up the last of the family wash on a high\r\nclothesline. In the late afternoon sunshine, a woman and her son were\r\nenjoying a walk around the back yard of their home on a large Kansas\r\nranch. Outside his house, a ten-year old boy was playing basketball with\r\nfriends. A veteran of World War II was loading fodder in a silo. In the\r\nfeedlot of his ranch, a farmer was stacking hay. A filling station\r\nattendant was working outside at the pumps, grateful for a spell of\r\nmilder winter weather.\r\n\r\nWithout warning, a large and very bright fireball streaked across the\r\nclear sky from southwest to northeast. Ominous-looking white\r\nsmoke-clouds mushroomed up from points in the fireball’s path. Shortly\r\nafter the fireball disappeared, loud explosions and rumbling sounds\r\ndrove thousands of people out into the open. The whole astonishing\r\nluminous display was over in a few seconds, but the strange clouds and\r\nthe frightening sounds that followed the fireball’s passage continued\r\nmuch longer.\r\n\r\nAlthough startled by the brilliant fireball and the strange thundering\r\nnoises, the young girl, whose face had been turned skyward as she hung\r\nup the clothes, noted very carefully where she had seen the fireball\r\ndisappear behind the tallest building in her home town. (Her sighting\r\nwas later of great value to field parties from the Institute of\r\nMeteoritics of the University of New Mexico.)\r\n\r\nThe woman and her son were amazed to see an angry, boiling white cloud\r\ntinged with red developing overhead in the blue sky and to hear strange\r\nwhizzing noises in the air around them.\r\n\r\nThe boy playing basketball heard a peculiar whistling or hissing noise\r\njust as he was ready to shoot a basket and, on looking up, saw the ball\r\nof fire slanting earthward. (This boy’s report was of particular\r\ninterest, since it related to an unusual type of “sound” that travels at\r\nthe speed of light rather than at the velocity of ordinary soundwaves.)\r\n\r\nAs a cannonading louder than any the veteran had heard on the\r\nbattlefields of Europe echoed over the rolling countryside, he went\r\ntemporarily into a state of shock.\r\n\r\nThe farmer stacking hay heard several explosions, felt a violent air\r\nblast, and finally heard a solid object strike the ground “with a\r\nsmack,” as he put it, “like a clod hitting the earth.” (Later, field\r\nsearchers found that this man lived only about two and a half miles\r\nsouth of the point where the largest fragment of the meteorite fell.)\r\n\r\nShortly after the passage of the fireball, the filling station attendant\r\nfelt the legs of his trousers flap as if he were standing in a high\r\nwind, although he was more than 11 miles distant from the actual path\r\nalong which the fireball moved on its way to the earth.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the Ussuri fall, which had occurred about a year\r\nearlier, farm animals, chickens, and dogs were terrified by the strange\r\nand noisy event. Cattle tried to run through a fence to escape the\r\ndeafening racket. A fine pair of horses panicked and ran headlong into a\r\nnarrow gully, the walls of which collapsed on them during their\r\nstruggles. Chickens dashed for the henhouse, screeching and cackling all\r\nthe way. A dog that feared lightning jumped behind a haystack and\r\nfinally ran to his master in alarm.\r\n\r\nAlthough the majority of the people did not see the fireball itself,\r\nthey were driven out-of-doors by the violent concussions that followed\r\nits passage, and thus got out under the open sky in ample time to see\r\nseveral large, turbulent white clouds mushrooming far overhead. From\r\nthese clouds, a thick powder or dust filtered down through the air and\r\ncollected on the surfaces of stock ponds and water tanks.\r\n\r\nSome people thought the peculiar clouds were similar to those produced\r\nby atom bomb explosions. Many suspected that a V-2 rocket had “run away”\r\nfrom the proving ground at White Sands, New Mexico. One man disagreed\r\nwith the opinion of his friends that the military had been experimenting\r\nand declared that it was “the Lord who was experimenting!”\r\n\r\nThe February 18 meteorite fall caused great excitement throughout Kansas\r\nand Nebraska, and it was the chief topic of conversation for days among\r\nthe residents of the many small farming communities along the western\r\nhalf of the Kansas-Nebraska state line.\r\n\r\nThe Ussuri fall was studied by Russian scientists exclusively, and we\r\nhave of necessity given, in Chapter 1, a secondhand account of the fall\r\nand surveys the Russians made; but field parties from the Institute of\r\nMeteoritics conducted on-the-spot investigations of the Norton, Kansas\r\nfall. As we were members of several of these field parties, the story to\r\nfollow is a firsthand report.\r\n\r\nA little before 6:00 p.m. on February 18, word of the mysterious\r\nexplosion centering near Norton, Kansas reached the Institute of\r\nMeteoritics, in Albuquerque, N. M., through the kind offices of Civil\r\nAir Patrol personnel. Since a number of early reports had described the\r\nincident as an airplane falling in flames, it was only natural that the\r\nCivil Air Patrol and similar groups would take an interest in the\r\noccurrence. At once, the staff of the Institute began to interview\r\neyewitnesses of the event through Civil Air Patrol channels and by long\r\ndistance telephone, telegram, and letter. Soon we had collected enough\r\ninformation to show clearly that a large meteorite fall had been\r\nresponsible for the unusual light and sound effects that had startled\r\nthe inhabitants of Kansas, Nebraska, and adjoining states.\r\n\r\nBy March 3, the Institute staff had made a first determination of the\r\nprobable area of fall. The center of this oval-shaped, 8 by 4 mile area\r\nlay about 15 miles north-northwest of Norton, Kansas and nearly on the\r\nKansas-Nebraska state line. The meteorite had fallen in a region of\r\nwheat fields, pasture lands, and widely scattered farm houses. The\r\ncountryside there is open and gently rolling. The small creeks winding\r\nthrough shallow valleys are marked in spring and summer by narrow bands\r\nof low green trees and bushes. Many of the hillsides are covered with\r\nunplowed buffalo sod.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A fragment of the Norton fall is removed still\r\n    imbedded in the tough buffalo grass sod into which it penetrated.]\r\n\r\nOn March 24, a field party left the University of New Mexico to make a\r\nsurvey of this area. Unfortunately, Kansas blizzards can be as severe as\r\nany in Siberia, and although the scientists gathered many helpful\r\nreports from eyewitnesses of the fall, heavy snow and high winds\r\nseriously hampered the work. The information they collected, however,\r\nconfirmed the accuracy of the Institute staff’s first determination of\r\nthe probable area of fall.\r\n\r\nLate in the spring, a farmer in this area found a “strange stone” on his\r\nland and held it for identification by the second Institute party. This\r\nstrange stone—which smelled like sulfur and had metallic specks in\r\nit—was the first piece of the fallen meteorite to be recovered.\r\n\r\nScientists and farmers soon found many other fragments during systematic\r\nsearches of the rolling farm and pasture lands. The fourteen-year-old\r\nboy who had been walking with his mother at the time of the fall\r\ndiscovered a 130-pound fragment of the meteorite in a pasture that had\r\nalready been carefully searched by grown-up meteorite hunters! This find\r\nwas one of the two largest fragments recovered from the entire fall. The\r\nlanding place of this large piece was marked only by a small hole in the\r\nsod, but, on prodding into this hole, the boy struck something rather\r\nsolid. He ran at once to tell the lady who owned the pastureland, and\r\ntogether they dug out the fine meteorite.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Furnas County, Nebraska, stony meteorite in place\r\n    at the bottom of its 10-foot “penetration funnel.”]\r\n\r\nThis discovery brought interest in finding meteorites to a fever pitch,\r\nand it was soon possible to look in almost any direction and see\r\nfarmers, or their wives and children, walking slowly across the fields\r\nand looking for meteorites.\r\n\r\nFinally, in August, two farmers cutting wheat in a field just a short\r\ndistance north of the Kansas-Nebraska state line found a deep hole when\r\ntheir tractor almost fell into it. They investigated and discovered that\r\na very large fragment of the meteorite had buried itself deep in the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nScientists from the University of Nebraska and the Institute of\r\nMeteoritics carefully excavated this huge meteorite. They found that the\r\nmass had plunged more than 10 feet into the earth. Quite by chance, its\r\nlower surface had come to rest in the ashes of a long-buried primitive\r\ncooking site.\r\n\r\nThe excavated meteorite looked and felt like a huge stone. Actually, it\r\nwas stony in nature, but of a texture so fragile that it had to be\r\nwrapped in tissue paper, then in burlap, and finally covered with a\r\nthick coating of plaster of Paris before it could be lifted out of the\r\nground. Those in charge of the removal of the meteorite borrowed this\r\nprocedure from the paleontologists, who use it in the removal of fossil\r\ntusks and bones that otherwise would crumble away.\r\n\r\nAfter the great meteorite had been raised out of the excavation, it was\r\ntaken by truck to the University of New Mexico, in Albuquerque. There it\r\nwas put on display beside the smaller 130-pound fragment found in May.\r\nBy careful measurements, scientists determined the weight of the main\r\nmass to be approximately 2,360 pounds—a record weight for stony\r\nmeteorites.[1] This remarkable meteorite, known as the Furnas County,\r\nNebraska, stone, is now a prized item in the collection of the Institute\r\nof Meteoritics.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Field party proudly surrounds the Furnas stone in its\r\n    protective “armor.”]\r\n\r\nAs more and more finds were made in the area of fall, we accurately\r\nrecorded their weights and mapped their locations. In this way, we could\r\ntell how the pieces of the meteorite had distributed themselves\r\naccording to size and weight over the oval-shaped area. The smaller and\r\nlighter fragments were slowed down by air resistance and fell first,\r\nwhile the 2,360-pound mass carried on beyond them and came to earth at\r\nthe farthest point along the direction of flight.\r\n\r\nThe staff of the Institute took many photographs of the meteorites that\r\nwere found, of the impact funnel made by the largest mass, and of the\r\nexcavation and removal of that giant stone. Some of these pictures were\r\npublished in scientific journals, others in magazine and newspaper\r\narticles. A few of our best photographs are included in this chapter.\r\n\r\nAlthough the light and sound effects that accompanied the Ussuri and\r\nNorton falls were similar, the meteorites recovered from them were not\r\nat all alike. The Ussuri specimens were masses of nickel-iron so\r\nmalleable that on high-speed impact with hard rock they had held\r\ntogether and taken twisted and ragged shapes. But the Norton meteorites\r\nwere very fragile stony masses, many of which went to pieces either in\r\nthe air or when they struck the ground. Almost all of the recoveries\r\nmade of this very rare type of stony meteorite were fragments, not whole\r\nspecimens. They somewhat resembled pieces of a strange whitish mixture\r\nof chalk and crystalline limestone containing tiny specks and lumps of\r\nnickel-iron. Many specimens were covered wholly or in part by a shiny\r\nvarnish-like fusion crust, varying in color from jet black through\r\nyellow to almost pure white.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Furnas stone, protected by its “armor,” hangs\r\n    suspended from the truck crane that raised it out of its deep\r\n    “penetration funnel” in the earth.]\r\n\r\nThe largest meteorite recovered from the Norton fall was the 2,360-pound\r\nmass that formed the deep impact funnel. The smallest Norton specimens,\r\nlike their Ussuri counterparts, weighed no more than the thousandth part\r\nof a gram. Altogether, nearly a ton and a half of meteoritic material\r\nfrom the Norton fall was collected by the Institute. Other small\r\nfragments may remain undiscovered in the Kansas and Nebraska wheatlands,\r\nbut, unfortunately, because of the soft and fragile nature of the\r\nmaterial they are composed of, it is likely that they have now weathered\r\naway so completely that they are no longer recognizable as meteorites.\r\n\r\nOur stories of the Ussuri and Norton meteorite falls show how hard\r\nscientists work themselves (and others!) to find meteorites. Therefore\r\nmeteorites must be important. The two accounts given also make clear\r\nthat investigators of meteorite falls are almost entirely dependent upon\r\nobservations made by nonscientists.\r\n\r\nScientists investigating meteorite falls greatly appreciate the help\r\ngiven them by children and adults alike. Field parties are powerless\r\nwithout it, and we should like to encourage people of all ages to\r\ncontinue this type of valuable cooperation. In Chapter 7, we shall tell\r\nmore about how the individual observer of a meteorite fall can make his\r\nreport really count.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A close-up of the Furnas County stone, the largest\r\n    stony meteorite ever recovered.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        3. FOUND AND LOST GIANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nAll meteorites are important from the standpoint of science, but a few\r\ndeserve special mention because of the human-interest stories connected\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nFirst place among famous finds should no doubt go to the massive Cape\r\nYork, Greenland, iron, the largest recovered meteorite actually to have\r\nbeen weighed. The Eskimos called this enormous object “Ahnighito,” which\r\nmeans “The Tent.” Robert E. Peary, the discoverer of the North Pole,\r\nbrought it to New York City by ship in 1897. His party had great\r\ndifficulty hoisting the 34-ton mass aboard. Later, when the ship had put\r\nto sea, she encountered a serious navigational hazard. To the amazement\r\nand alarm of the crew, the huge nickel-iron meteorite caused magnetic\r\ndisturbances that severely affected the ship’s compass.\r\n\r\nAnother of the giant meteorites, the 14-ton Willamette, Oregon, iron,\r\nbecame the center of a long legal battle in the early 1900’s. The man\r\nwho originally found the meteorite and recognized its true nature felt\r\nthat because the iron was on the surface of the ground and not buried\r\nbeneath it (as the ore of a metal would have been), there was no reason\r\nwhy he should not move the mass from the place of find to his own\r\nproperty, three-fourths of a mile away. He did this very laboriously by\r\nmeans of a log-timber car, a capstan with wire rope, and a small horse.\r\nOn learning what the finder had done, the company that owned the land\r\nfrom which the meteorite had been removed put its attorneys on the job\r\nof recovering the “purloined” meteorite. The Oregon courts, bowing to\r\ndecisions made in previous cases involving ownership of meteorites,\r\nbrought in a verdict favoring the owners of the land. Although the\r\nfinder of the Willamette meteorite lost the decision, he nevertheless\r\nwon the distinction of being the only man to have successfully made off\r\nwith a treasure weighing 14 tons!\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:        COURTESY OF AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY\r\n     Peary’s photograph of the Cape York meteorite as it was being moved\r\n    for loading aboard his ship.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:        COURTESY OF AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY\r\n     Arrival of the 34-ton iron mass at the American Museum of Natural\r\n    History, New York City.]\r\n\r\nThe biggest meteorite of all, of course, is the one that “got away.” In\r\n1916, a captain in the Mauritanian army was taken by a native guide,\r\nsecretly and at night, to the site of a colossal iron meteorite located\r\nin the dunes of the Adrar desert, in the far western reaches of the vast\r\nSahara. The officer described the mass as measuring 100 meters (over 300\r\nfeet) by 40 meters (over 120 feet), with the third dimension hidden by\r\nthe sand dunes. According to him, the mass “... jutted up in the midst\r\nof sand dunes that were covered by a desert plant, the _sba_, and it had\r\nthe form of a compact, unfissured parallelopiped. The visible portion of\r\nthe surface was vertical, dominating in the manner of a cliff, the\r\nwind-blown sand that was scooped away from the base of the mass so that\r\nthe summit overhung; and that portion exposed to eolian [wind] erosion\r\nwas polished like a mirror.”\r\n\r\nThe captain, at the request of his uneasy guide, returned from his\r\nhurried excursion without taking notes or making a map. But he did bring\r\nback a small 10-pound fragment of iron which he had found lying on top\r\nof the giant mass. This small fragment later proved to be a genuine\r\nmeteorite, and is the only known specimen of the famous Adrar mass. It\r\nis preserved at present in the Museum of Natural History at Paris.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:                                J. OTIS WHEELOCK PHOTO\r\n                          COURTESY OF AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY\r\n     Man and boy carrying off the famous “purloined” Willamette\r\n    meteorite on a homemade dolly car with wheels of tree-trunk\r\n    sections. Note hole piercing this 14-ton chunk of iron.]\r\n\r\nWhat has been called a conspiracy of silence among the natives of the\r\nAdrar area and the inhospitable nature of the region itself have\r\nsuccessfully preserved the secret of the location of the enormous\r\nmetallic mass described by the captain. The native guide died,\r\napparently of poison, and although many inhabitants of the region are no\r\ndoubt familiar with the whereabouts of the mass (whatever it is!), those\r\nquestioned have consistently denied knowledge of its very existence. All\r\nrecent attempts, not only by military but even by scientific\r\nexpeditions, to relocate the gigantic metallic mass have failed. The\r\nwhole Adrar case remains an intriguing puzzle to be unraveled, it is\r\nhoped, by future generations of meteorite hunters.\r\n\r\nAnother “lost” meteorite is one composed of stone and iron. The Port\r\nOrford, Oregon, stony-iron (as it is now named) was originally found in\r\n1859 by a U.S. geologist who was engaged in a survey of what were then\r\nthe Oregon and Washington Territories. According to him, the mass was\r\nquite irregular in shape and “4 or 5 feet [of it] projected from the\r\nsurface of the mountain,” while it was “about the same number of feet in\r\nwidth and perhaps 3 or 4 feet in thickness.” He broke off a small\r\nfragment of it (far smaller than the one taken from Adrar) and packed\r\nthis specimen away with his collection of rock and mineral samples.\r\nYears later, the geological collection was cataloged and analyzed in the\r\nEast. At that time, the fragment collected in 1859 was found to be a\r\npiece of a stony-iron meteorite. After that, scientists and others made\r\nmany attempts to rediscover the main mass of the large Port Orford\r\nmeteorite, all of them unsuccessful. Today the sum total of material\r\nrecovered from this stony-iron amounts to 25 grams in the U.S. National\r\nMuseum, about 4 grams in the Natural History Museum of Vienna, and a few\r\ntiny specks in the Museum of the Geological Survey of India.\r\n\r\nThe Red River, Texas, iron is still another famous meteorite. It was\r\noriginally discovered by Pawnee and Hietan Indians, and a group of them\r\ntook a party of traders, in 1808, to the site. Two years later, two\r\nrival parties, each led by a man who had been a member of the 1808\r\ntrading expedition, began a search for the meteorite. The members of one\r\nof the two parties were from Nacogodoches, Texas. They reached the\r\nmeteorite first but had left home so hurriedly on their eager hunt that\r\nthey were not properly prepared to move so large a mass. They went away\r\nfrom the site to get horses and a wagon, after they had laboriously\r\nhidden the meteorite under a huge flat stone, to prevent the other party\r\nfrom finding it. The members of the other party, hailing from\r\nNatchitoches, Louisiana, set out better prepared. After a lengthy hunt,\r\nthey finally found the hidden meteorite. Using tools they had the\r\nforesight to bring, they built a truck wagon and drove away with their\r\nprize. Eventually, the Red River meteorite, weighing 1,635 pounds,\r\nbecame a part of the collection at Yale University. But two other,\r\nsmaller, masses of the same metal, known in the early days to the\r\nPawnees and a few traders, remain still undiscovered in the Red River\r\narea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                4. WHEN IS A CRATER A METEORITE CRATER?\r\n\r\n\r\nNot all meteorites form craters at impact, as the larger Ussuri\r\nfragments did. Even the largest mass of the Norton meteorite merely\r\nburied itself in a funnel-like hole only about 10 feet deep. And the\r\nRussian investigators found a number of the lighter Ussuri fragments at\r\nthe bottom of small penetration funnels. Cosmic missiles that are large\r\nenough to blast out craters in the ground are of particular interest to\r\nscience, however, not only because of the extraordinarily intense light,\r\nsound, and other effects that accompany their fall, but also because\r\nthey produce characteristic and long-lasting basin-like features in the\r\nouter shell of the earth.\r\n\r\nNatural processes that change the surface features of the earth have\r\nlong been the subjects of field studies by scientists. Geologists have\r\ncarefully investigated the major folds formed in the earth’s crust by\r\nmountain-building forces, the clefts and depressions resulting from\r\nearthquake activity and erosion, and the vast plains leveled off by the\r\nscouring action of great ice-sheets. All of these different natural\r\nprocesses, though, have one thing in common: their source is the\r\nearth-body itself. They take place either _within_ the earth’s crust as\r\na result of local shifts or changes in pressure (like earthquakes and\r\nvolcanic eruptions), or _on_ the surface of the earth as a result of the\r\naction of water or of changes in temperature (like erosion and\r\nglaciation).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, meteorite impact craters are not formed by\r\nearth-processes at all. As we have seen, they result when large bodies\r\nof matter from the regions of space _outside_ the earth chance to strike\r\nthe surface of our planet at high speed. The study of meteorite craters\r\nis therefore a special field. It is also one of quite recent\r\ndevelopment; not until 1905 was the first meteorite crater recognized as\r\nsuch.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be said on this subject is, of course, that not all\r\nholes in the ground, however large and impressive, were necessarily\r\nformed by the impact of meteorites. Features that resemble meteorite\r\ncraters may result from certain ordinary earth-processes. For example,\r\nthe rock layers underlying a particular area may be dissolved away by\r\nwaters circulating beneath the surface of the ground. The overlying\r\ncrust will eventually collapse into the empty space, and what geologists\r\ncall a “sink hole” or a “sink” is formed. Many such sinks surround the\r\ngenuine meteorite crater near Odessa, Texas, and at times have been\r\nmistaken for the real thing.\r\n\r\nSince there is some possibility of confusion about whether or not a hole\r\nin the ground is a meteorite crater, it is comforting to know that\r\nscientists have come up with a handy set of rules for reaching a\r\ndecision on this point. These rules can be stated in the form of several\r\nquestions that crater-investigators should ask themselves:\r\n\r\n  Have you found meteorites in or near the crater-like feature?\r\n\r\n  In its vicinity, have you found pieces of country rock that show the\r\n  effects of high temperature and pressure (melting or crushing)?\r\n\r\n  Did people actually see a meteorite come to earth at the point where\r\n  the crater is located and where, to their certain knowledge, no crater\r\n  existed before?\r\n\r\nIf the answer to all—or even one—of these questions is yes, then it is\r\nquite likely that the crater-like feature is actually a meteorite\r\ncrater. Naturally, if the answer to the _first_ question is yes, the\r\nmatter is practically settled in favor of the meteoritic origin of the\r\nfeature.\r\n\r\nIf the impact has taken place in horizontally bedded rock strata—that\r\nis, in flat beds of rock lying one on top of another like the layers in\r\na stack of griddle cakes—a meteorite crater will have a characteristic\r\n_rim_ of upturned or even overturned rock layers. (None of the ordinary\r\nsink holes near the Odessa crater show such rims.) In addition, pieces\r\nof rock shattered and thrown out by the impact will be found in all\r\ndirections around the crater. The amount and size of this fragmented\r\nmaterial will decrease with distance outward from the crater.\r\n\r\nA list of the recognized (or genuine) meteorite craters of the world is\r\ngiven in the table on page 65. All of these craters except the two\r\nRussian ones were formed many thousands of years ago, and, in most\r\ncases, the earth processes of erosion and weathering have by now dimmed\r\nthe sharp outlines of their rims and silted up their deep interior\r\nfunnels until only basin-like bowls remain.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Cross-section showing the manner in which\r\n    horizontally bedded rock strata may be broken and tilted upward by\r\n    the impact of a crater-forming meteorite. This schematic diagram is\r\n    based on excavations at several meteorite craters.]\r\n\r\nYou may have visited the very first crater in the world to be recognized\r\nby scientists as a meteorite crater. This huge basin, now known as the\r\nCanyon Diablo meteorite crater (although often referred to incorrectly\r\nas “Meteor Crater”), lies about 20 miles west of Winslow, Arizona. It is\r\nthe best known of all the craters listed in the table because in recent\r\nyears it has been developed under private ownership as one of the\r\nleading tourist attractions on U.S. Highway 66.\r\n\r\nFrom the paved road that turns off Highway 66 toward the crater, the\r\nvisitor sees the rim as a chain of low, hummocky, tan-colored hills\r\nwhich contrast sharply with the grayish or reddish hue of the desert\r\nplain.\r\n\r\nThe outer slopes of the crater rim rise very gently from the level plain\r\nin which the crater was formed, and they are covered with rock fragments\r\nof various sizes thrown out at the time the meteorite struck the earth.\r\nThis fragmented material ranges in size from tiny particles of\r\n“rock-flour” as soft as face-powder to gigantic solid masses like\r\nMonument Rock, which is estimated to weigh 4,000 tons.\r\n\r\nField parties have found 50- to 100-pound fragments of the limestone\r\nlayer underlying the Canyon Diablo area at distances of 1½ to 2 miles\r\nfrom the crater. Sizable rock and meteorite fragments out to distances\r\nof 6 miles from the rim have turned up, and smaller fragments of both\r\nmaterials at even greater distances.\r\n\r\nOn their first visit to the Canyon Diablo crater, people are always\r\nastonished at the steepness of the inner walls of the crater and at the\r\nvery great size of its bowl. This crater is more than 4,000 feet across\r\nand 570 feet deep. It is the largest _recognized_ meteorite crater so\r\nfar discovered in the world, although other larger, basin-like features\r\nelsewhere on the surface of the earth have been suspected but not proved\r\nto have a similar origin.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:                      COURTESY OF TRANS-WORLD AIRLINES\r\n     Aerial view of the Canyon Diablo, Arizona, meteorite crater.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Canyon Diablo meteorite plunged into the horizontally bedded\r\nrock layers underlying the area of fall, the force of the explosion\r\nfollowing the impact actually bent these layers upward. All around the\r\ninside of the crater, the rock strata tilt away from the center at steep\r\nangles.\r\n\r\nCowboys, ranchers, and scientists have found thousands of solid\r\nnickel-iron meteorite fragments around the crater. The largest of these\r\nweighs 1,406 pounds. The smallest spherules and grains are almost or\r\nquite microscopic in size. (These tiny granules have been well known to\r\nscientists since 1905 in spite of current fables claiming that they are\r\na recent discovery.) In the rim and on the plain outside the crater,\r\nlarge and small _shale balls_, composed of weathered meteoritic\r\nmaterial, were found in considerable numbers in the early days. Along\r\nwith many solid iron meteorites, shale balls have also been found at\r\nvarious depths in recent times by field parties from the Institute\r\nemploying specially designed meteorite detectors.\r\n\r\nIn the first two decades of the twentieth century, investigators sank\r\n(at great expense!) a number of shafts and drill holes in the interior\r\nand on the south rim of the crater, in unsuccessful attempts to locate\r\nthe supposed “main mass” of the Canyon Diablo meteorite. Most\r\nauthorities now believe, however, that the extremely high temperatures,\r\ndeveloped at the time the Canyon Diablo meteorite penetrated into the\r\nearth, changed almost all of the gigantic cosmic missile into vapor.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: View of the interior of the Canyon Diablo crater\r\n    showing the steep inner slopes of the huge basin.]\r\n\r\nNo better example of an ancient meteorite crater has been found than\r\nthis one near Canyon Diablo. The other craters listed in the table (even\r\nthe two recently formed ones), while bearing resemblances to it, also\r\nshow individual differences from it.\r\n\r\nSome, like Henbury, Campo del Cielo, and Haviland, are not single\r\ncraters but rather consist of fields of craters. In these cases, the\r\nearth was struck not by a single large meteoritic body that held\r\ntogether right down to impact, but either by a “swarm” of meteorites\r\ntraveling together through space or by the fragments of a large\r\nmeteorite that separated into pieces shortly before it struck the\r\nsurface of the ground.\r\n\r\nAgain, the type of ground into which the meteorite strikes affects the\r\ncharacter of the craters formed. As an illustration, the Wabar, Arabia,\r\ncraters were not smashed out of sedimentary, horizontally bedded rock\r\nlayers (as was the Canyon Diablo crater) but were formed in clean desert\r\nsand dunes. In this case, the crater rims are composed primarily of\r\nalmost pure silica-glass formed by the fusion of the sand at the time of\r\nimpact. It is not hard to imagine the terrific boiling and frothing up\r\nof melted sand and meteoritic material that must have accompanied the\r\nformation of the Wabar craters.\r\n\r\nExcept for Podkamennaya Tunguska and Ussuri, the craters listed in the\r\ntable were formed, as we have mentioned, a great many thousands of years\r\nin the past. Just how many thousands is a difficult question to answer,\r\nfor all of our estimates must necessarily be made on the basis of\r\n_indirect_ evidence rather than on _direct_ observation.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Before impact of Canyon Diablo meteorite, these rock\r\n    layers were horizontal.]\r\n\r\nPaleontologists, geologists, and other scientists give us an age of from\r\n20,000 to 70,000 years for the Canyon Diablo crater. The discovery of\r\nthe fossil remains of a prehistoric horse buried in the Odessa, Texas,\r\ncrater fill has shown that the age of that crater is not less than\r\n200,000 years. The oldest craters known in the United States are the\r\nHaviland group produced by the Brenham, Kansas, meteorites.\r\nLong-continued weathering has almost completely worn down the rims and\r\ncovered up the craters of this group. On the basis of the rate at which\r\nnickel-oxide has spread out into the soil about a large deeply buried\r\nBrenham meteorite, calculations carried out at the Institute of\r\nMeteoritics have led to a tentative age of more than 600,000 years for\r\nthe Kansas craters.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the oldest meteorite crater of all is the one blasted into what\r\nthe geologists identify as pre-Cambrian quartzite at Wolf Creek, Western\r\nAustralia. Even the highly resistant iron meteorites found around this\r\ncrater have almost completely weathered away. Only tiny specks and thin\r\nveinlets of metal are now visible on the cut surfaces of meteorites\r\nthat, untold hundreds of thousands of years ago, were solid masses of\r\nnickel-iron.\r\n\r\nYou may have noticed that the widely publicized circular, water-filled\r\nChubb crater in the Quebec Province of Canada was not included in the\r\ntable. This Canadian feature was left out because the answer to each of\r\nthe three questions listed earlier in this chapter is no.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:                        COURTESY OF WILLIAM A. CASSIDY\r\n     Two of the deeply weathered meteorites found at Wolf Creek crater\r\n    in western Australia.]\r\n\r\nThe field parties that have carefully searched the Chubb crater and its\r\nsurroundings, even when they used one of the Institute’s powerful drag\r\nmagnets, were unable to find any trace whatever either of meteorites or\r\nof such weathered remains of meteorites as show the true nature of the\r\nWolf Creek crater. Furthermore, no searcher has discovered any fragments\r\nof ordinary rock showing the effects of the extreme heat and pressure\r\nthat accompany large-scale meteoritic impact. Finally, the meteorite\r\nsupposed by some to have produced the Chubb crater was not a recorded\r\nwitnessed fall, for the crater is of very ancient origin indeed.\r\n\r\nPerhaps further search of the Chubb crater site and especially of the\r\ndebris in its deep, water-filled interior will succeed in bringing to\r\nlight either specimens of meteorites or of silica-glass or other\r\nproducts of meteoritic impact. If so, then and only then will\r\nidentification of the Canadian crater as a meteorite crater be\r\njustified.\r\n\r\nUp to this point, we have talked only of very old meteorite craters. But\r\ntwo crater-producing meteorite falls have occurred within this century,\r\nboth in Siberia. The Ussuri fall was one of these and the more recent of\r\nthe two.\r\n\r\nThe earlier and more unusual fall took place on June 30, 1908, at about\r\n8:00 a.m., approximately 40 miles northwest of the trading post of\r\nVanovara. A fireball exceeding the sun in brilliance flashed across the\r\nsky and was followed by extremely violent airwaves and earth-tremors.\r\n\r\nThe pressure wave in the atmosphere set up by this meteorite fall was\r\nstrong enough to damage roofs and doors of houses near the point of\r\nimpact, as for example, in the village of Vanovara. On both rivers and\r\nlakes in the area of fall, the pressure wave in the air piled up high,\r\nsharp-fronted water waves that resembled the bores on the Seine and\r\nSevern and that upset fishing craft and swamped other small boats.\r\nThroughout a wide region at somewhat greater distances from the impact\r\npoint, tidal-like bores were raised on rivers and lakes. So gigantic was\r\nthe atmospheric disturbance, that it was detected at almost every\r\nstation in the world where sufficiently sensitive barometers were in\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nEyewitnesses of this meteorite fall said that at the time the fireball\r\npassed near them, they felt almost unbearable heat.\r\n\r\nA huge “fiery pillar” rose above the point of impact, which by good\r\nfortune was in a desolate and almost uninhabited swampy basin between\r\nthe Chunya and the Podkamennaya (i.e., “Stony”) Tunguska rivers. The\r\nmeteorite fall takes its name from the latter stream.\r\n\r\nThe central portion of the region of impact is marked not only by a\r\nnumber of craters in the swampy terrain, but also by mute evidence of\r\nthe extraordinary destructive power of the Podkamennaya Tunguska\r\nmeteorite. Over an area of many square miles, the explosion blew down\r\nthe standing forest so that the tops of the overthrown trees (estimated\r\nby the Russians to number more than 80,000,000!) all point away from the\r\nimpact center. The intense heat charred the trunks and branches of the\r\ntrees in this area in much the same way as the heat from the first of\r\nall atomic bomb explosions scorched the desert shrubs around the test\r\nsite in south-central New Mexico.\r\n\r\nWithin the area of fall, countless reindeer belonging to the native\r\nTunguse herdsmen were killed, only their charred carcasses remaining.\r\nHow great the heat released at impact was may be judged by the\r\nwell-established fact that the prized silver samovars of the nomads were\r\nfound melted amid the debris of their flattened camps. In at least one\r\ninstance, a Tunguse was so overcome by the terrible event he had\r\nwitnessed that he was “sick for a long time.” The whole impact-region\r\ncame to be considered as accursed by the natives, who abandoned the use\r\nof all trails crossing it.\r\n\r\nFor many years the Podkamennaya Tunguska fall was neglected, partly\r\nbecause of the remoteness of the area in which it occurred, partly\r\nbecause of unsettled conditions in Russia; but chiefly because, in\r\ngeneral, the Russian scientific and governmental officials simply did\r\nnot believe the “fantastic” tales concerning the fall told by the native\r\nTunguses, from which we have given a few details above.\r\n\r\nBelated study established, however, both the truthfulness of the Tunguse\r\nreports and the exceedingly unusual character of the meteorite fall\r\nitself. In spite of the overwhelming and, in fact, worldwide evidence\r\nthat the Podkamennaya Tunguska fall was one of the greatest and most\r\nviolent in history, no meteorites have ever been recovered from any part\r\nof the region devastated by its impact. It is the one and only true\r\nmeteorite crater that is meteoriteless!\r\n\r\nThis strange circumstance led the senior author to suggest, in 1941,\r\nthat the almost incredible Podkamennaya Tunguska incident had resulted\r\nfrom the infall of a meteorite that, together with an equivalent mass of\r\nthe earth-target, was transformed into energy upon contact with our\r\nplanet. How can such extraordinary behavior be accounted for?\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:                        LEONID A. KULIK PHOTO. SOVFOTO\r\n     Infall of meteorite, June 30, 1908, had this effect on a Siberian\r\n    forest. See p. 55.]\r\n\r\nThe most obvious explanation involves a new and wider concept of matter.\r\nOrdinary terrestrial matter is regarded as composed of atoms having\r\npositively charged nuclei around which negatively charged electrons\r\nrevolve.\r\n\r\nSuppose that the situation shown in the first diagram were reversed so\r\nthat the nucleus of the atom were negatively charged and the charges of\r\nthe particles revolving about it were positive, as in the second\r\ndiagram. Matter built up from atoms like those in this diagram would\r\nbear somewhat the same relation to ordinary matter that -2 does to +2.\r\nSuch matter is now known variously as _reversed matter_, _anti_-matter,\r\nor, as it was first called by V. Rojansky, _contraterrene_ matter. In\r\nrecent years, scientists at the University of California Radiation\r\nLaboratory have produced experimentally all the fundamental particles\r\nnecessary for the creation of contraterrene matter.\r\n\r\nWhat would happen now if a contraterrene meteorite penetrated into the\r\nordinary matter of the earth? The answer is that just as an electron and\r\na positron mutually annihilate each other when they collide, so the\r\nmeteorite and an equal mass of the earth-target itself would vanish at\r\nthe instant of impact. The nearest simple analogy to the actual complex\r\nphysical situation is represented by the familiar equation -2 + 2 = 0.\r\n\r\nUnlike “summing to zero” in simple arithmetic, however, the\r\ndisappearance of mass, technically called its annihilation, results in a\r\nrelease of energy, as was long ago observed in the case of\r\nelectron-positron annihilation. Where considerable masses are\r\nannihilated, as in an A-bomb explosion, the amount of energy released is\r\ntremendous, as is now well known to everyone.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A. Representation of the structure of an atom of\r\n    ordinary terrestrial matter. The nucleus is positively charged and\r\n    around it circle negatively charged electrons.\r\n\r\n    B. Representation of the structure of an atom of contraterrene\r\n    matter. This is the reverse of the situation in (A). The nucleus\r\n    here is negatively charged, and around it revolve positively charged\r\n    electrons, also called positrons.]\r\n\r\nThe effect of such an energy release as would accompany the infall of a\r\ncontraterrene meteorite would be a _natural_ nuclear explosion of vast\r\npower. Such an explosion would account for all the sensational phenomena\r\nobserved at the time of the Podkamennaya Tunguska incident; and,\r\nfurthermore, would explain why the Russian investigators have never\r\nsucceeded in recovering meteorites from this fall. (Further details, p.\r\n102.)\r\n\r\nIf the Podkamennaya Tunguska meteorite was contraterrene, then the soil\r\nin the impact area must have been made radioactive in the same way that\r\nthe earth around the “ground zero” of a nuclear explosion is\r\ncontaminated by radioactivity. After the senior author had repeatedly\r\nurged Russian scientists (who are the only ones that have been permitted\r\nto visit the site of the Podkamennaya Tunguska fall) to try to detect\r\nany long-lasting radioactivities that might still be present in the\r\nground at Podkamennaya Tunguska, such a radioactivity survey was finally\r\ncarried out in the summer of 1960. According to an official report of\r\nthe Soviet news agency TASS, the investigators obtained “abnormally high\r\nradioactivity readings” which the Russians tentatively considered to be\r\nthe result of “a natural nuclear explosion” occurring in the\r\nPodkamennaya Tunguska area on June 30, 1908.\r\n\r\nScience-fiction fans in the U.S.S.R. would like to believe that this\r\n“nuclear explosion” resulted from the impact of a Martian spaceship\r\nrather than a contraterrene meteorite. Reputable Russian scientists,\r\nhowever, have shown how completely absurd this “fable” of a Martian\r\nlanding really is.\r\n\r\nWhen and where will the next crater-producing fall occur? Perhaps on the\r\nearth, perhaps on the moon, for our nearest neighbor in space has also\r\nbeen the target of meteorites of huge size. The effects of this\r\nmeteoritic bombardment are shown by the rarest and most striking type of\r\nlunar crater: that which exhibits long, bright rays extending outward\r\nfrom the crater itself as the spokes of a wheel radiate from its hub.\r\nThese so-called _ray-craters_ show to best advantage at or near the time\r\nof full moon, when they become one of the most remarkable features\r\nvisible on our satellite.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:    G. W. RICHEY PHOTO. COURTESY OF YERKES OBSERVATORY\r\n     The lunar ray-crater Tycho.]\r\n\r\nIn earlier days, most scientists believed that the craters on the moon\r\nhad _all_ been formed by volcanic action. Now the pendulum of scientific\r\nopinion seems to have swung toward the view that _all_ the thousands of\r\nlunar craters are the result of meteorite impacts that took place in the\r\nlong distant past. Both views are better examples of how scientific\r\n“fashions” control men’s minds than they are of explanations that really\r\naccount for all of the observed facts—as any acceptable explanation must\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nThose who have studied the moon most carefully from an uncomfortable\r\nseat in a cold observatory rather than from a warm, comfortable armchair\r\nare well aware that instead of just one type of lunar crater, there are\r\nreally _two_ quite distinct types. No single “explanation” can be\r\nexpected to explain satisfactorily lunar features as strikingly\r\ndifferent as:\r\n\r\nFirst, the rare and distinctive _ray-craters_ described above, which are\r\nscattered at random over the moon, just as the points of impact of\r\nmeteorites are upon our own globe. (Roughly defined, a random\r\ndistribution is one showing no apparent pattern. For example, if you\r\nwere to throw a handful of rice up in the air, the points where the\r\ngrains of rice finally came to rest on the floor would be randomly\r\ndistributed or very nearly so.)\r\n\r\nSecond, the ordinary or “run-of-the-mill” craters sprinkled in profuse\r\nbut non-random fashion over the visible face of our satellite.\r\n\r\nThe ray-craters on the moon are the counterparts of the meteorite\r\ncraters on the earth. This fact is shown not only by their random\r\ndistribution, but by the long, bright rays which gave them their name.\r\nOn the earth, rays of similar appearance, composed of thrown-out\r\nmaterial, are one of the most characteristic features of explosion\r\ncraters, whether the cause of the explosion is the high-speed impact of\r\na great meteorite or the detonation of a charge of high explosive\r\n(either conventional or nuclear).\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis that meteorite craters do exist on the moon is therefore\r\njustified even though it applies to far fewer craters than its\r\nsupporters believe.\r\n\r\nAs for the ordinary, non-ray lunar craters, these features are not at\r\nall volcanic craters in the usual sense. One of the few good things to\r\ncome out of World War II was the first satisfactory explanation of the\r\n“run-of-the-mill” craters on the moon. Jeremi Wasiutynski, a brilliant\r\nPolish scientist forced to take refuge in Norway, sought to explain\r\nthese craters as originating in _convection_ processes.\r\n\r\nWhile the term “convection” may not be familiar, the role convection\r\nplays in filling the sky with beautiful clouds on a hot summer’s day is\r\nwell known. Such cloud formation results from convection in the gaseous\r\nfree atmosphere. Much more remarkable and regular are the results of\r\n_controlled_ convection in layers of _liquids_ rather than gases.\r\nLaboratory investigation of the effects produced by convection processes\r\nin heated liquids formed the basis for Wasiutynski’s new theory.\r\n\r\nAccording to this theory, convection processes in the only partially\r\nsolidified outer shell of the youthful moon could have given rise to\r\ngreat numbers of surface features having the size, shape, and\r\ndistribution of the common lunar craters. In far more satisfactory\r\nfashion than any other theory so far proposed, the convection-current\r\nhypothesis of Wasiutynski explains the many and distinctive\r\ncharacteristics of the non-ray craters on the moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n               RECOGNIZED METEORITE CRATERS OF THE WORLD\r\n\r\n  NAME                      LOCATION                             DATE OF\r\n                                                             RECOGNITION\r\n\r\n  Canyon Diablo             Coconino County, Arizona                1905\r\n  Odessa                    Ector County, Texas                     1929\r\n  Henbury                   McDonnell Ranges, Central               1932\r\n                            Australia\r\n  Wabar                     Rub’ al Khali, Arabia                   1932\r\n  Campo del Cielo           Gran Chaco, Argentina                   1933\r\n  [2]Haviland (Brenham)     Kiowa County, Kansas                    1933\r\n  Mount Darwin              Tasmania                                1933\r\n  [3]Podkamennaya Tunguska  Yeniseisk District, Siberia             1933\r\n  Box Hole Station          Plenty River, Central                   1937\r\n                            Australia\r\n  Kaalijarv                 Oesel, Estonia                          1937\r\n  Dalgaranga                Western Australia                       1938\r\n  Ussuri (Sikhote-Alin)     Eastern Siberia                         1947\r\n  Wolf Creek                Wyndham, Kimberley,                     1948\r\n                            Western Australia\r\n  Aouelloul                 Adrar, Western Sahara                   1952\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     5. HEAVEN KNOWS WHERE OR WHEN\r\n\r\n\r\nMeteorites have been falling upon our planet for a long time—how long,\r\nit is hard to say with accuracy. Up to now, no specimens certainly\r\nidentified as meteorites have been found in ancient rock layers.\r\nScientists have been able, however, to estimate the age of several\r\nmeteorite craters on the basis of the degree of weathering not only of\r\nthe crater rims, but also of the meteorites found around the craters.\r\nAge estimates have also been based on the ages of fossils found in\r\nsilted-up crater interiors and on other related indirect evidence.\r\n\r\nAs we have already noted, the Canyon Diablo, Arizona, crater is thought\r\nto be 20,000 to 70,000 years old. The Odessa, Texas, crater is at least\r\n200,000 years old; and the Haviland (Brenham), Kansas, craters more than\r\n600,000 years old. Clearly, meteorite falls have been occurring over a\r\nvery long period of earth history.\r\n\r\nFor many years, scientists have studied the distribution of recovered\r\nmeteorites around the world in an effort to find out whether there are\r\nany places on the land surface of our globe where meteorites have fallen\r\nin unusually large numbers.\r\n\r\nThe idea that any particular spot on the land surface of the earth might\r\nin some way attract more meteorites to it than other locations seems\r\nunreasonable because of the very nature of the target presented by our\r\nplanet to the meteorites wandering through space. Not only is the earth\r\nin motion, but it is in very complicated motion. Our earth revolves\r\nabout a sun which is also in motion through space. At the same time, the\r\nearth is rotating on its axis. A single point on the surface of the\r\nearth therefore traces a very erratic path in space with the passage of\r\nthe years, and the likelihood that this particular point would be struck\r\nby more than one meteorite (if indeed by one!) must be very small.\r\n\r\nStudies have shown that the people of the earth have a great deal more\r\nto do with “concentrations” of meteorite recoveries than anything else.\r\n_Population density_ is the first important factor. Clearly, the more\r\npeople living in a given area, the higher the probability that a\r\nmeteorite fall will be seen and reported and that the fallen mass itself\r\nwill be recovered. A prime example is India, one of the most densely\r\npopulated regions of the world. Of the 102 meteorites recovered in that\r\ncountry up to 1953, 97 were of witnessed fall. This extremely high\r\nproportion of falls is undoubtedly due to the fact that for centuries\r\nsuch an event could hardly have taken place in that country without\r\nattracting the attention of large numbers of people. Apparently, the\r\nmajority of Indian meteorites have been recovered as they fell, for only\r\n5 unwitnessed falls are recorded for that country.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, from French West Africa only 5 falls and 3 finds have\r\nbeen reported throughout an area slightly larger even than India’s. This\r\ncountry thus provides an example of a sparsely populated region, in many\r\nprovinces of which a meteorite fall might pass unobserved, and a fallen\r\nmeteorite might remain undiscovered.\r\n\r\nA second factor is the _degree of civilization_ reached by the\r\ninhabitants of a particular area. Those regions of the world which have\r\nbeen settled the longest and which have seen the development of the\r\nhigher cultures will be the most likely to support a populace that will\r\ntake an interest in and report the occurrences of natural events like\r\nmeteorite falls. Such a populace will also be more likely to bring\r\nsuspected meteorites to the attention of experts.\r\n\r\nFor example, up to 1953, 55 witnessed falls and 3 unwitnessed falls were\r\nknown from France, a country of relatively small area, but with a high\r\npopulation density and an advanced degree of civilization. From the\r\nwhole vast area of Siberia, on the other hand, only 20 meteorite falls\r\nand 23 finds have been reported during the same interval.\r\n\r\nIn the past, scientists have suggested that various natural forces, such\r\nas the magnetic field of the earth or the attraction of high and massive\r\nmountain ranges, might cause more meteorites to fall in one place than\r\nanother. But all available evidence indicates that this is not the case.\r\nThe fall of meteorites upon the earth has been and is a process that\r\nshows no apparent pattern. Only “human” factors (like population density\r\nand scientific interest in meteorites) can be considered as accounting\r\nfor any concentrations of meteorite falls in particular regions or\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nIn historic times, the number of man-built structures (houses, barns,\r\nhotels, office buildings, etc.) has increased tremendously. Such\r\nstructures have presented an ever-expanding target to hits by falling\r\nmeteorites. On pages 73, 74 is a listing of some of the meteorites that\r\nhave struck and damaged buildings during the last 150 years or so. The\r\nitems included in this list were chosen on the basis of interest,\r\nauthenticity, and concreteness of detail.\r\n\r\nThe stories of all these meteorite falls are exciting, but none more so,\r\nperhaps, than that of the Beddgelert, North Wales, stone. This meteorite\r\nfell in the small hours of the morning on September 21, 1949. Not many\r\npeople saw the fireball that accompanied its descent because of the\r\nearly hour (1:45 a.m.), but one of the few persons who happened to be\r\noutside said that it resembled a huge rocket as it flashed across the\r\nsky. He also reported that the appearance of the fireball nearly\r\nfrightened the swans in the local park to death, the birds fleeing in\r\nall directions.\r\n\r\nThe manager of one of the hotels in Beddgelert simultaneously was\r\nawakened from a sound sleep by the barking of his dog. This was an\r\nunusual occurrence, and the man was surprised by it. While he was trying\r\nto account for the dog’s peculiar behavior, he suddenly realized that\r\nsomething quite out of the ordinary was happening outside. He heard a\r\nseries of unevenly spaced bangs that he later compared to “a naval\r\nbroadside.” But as the noise died away and nothing further happened, he\r\nwent back to sleep.\r\n\r\nAbout noon on the next day, the manager’s wife went into the upstairs\r\nlounge of the hotel, a room right under a part of the roof. She was\r\nastonished to find plaster dust all over the floor. It had obviously\r\ncome from a jagged hole in the ceiling. And, on the floor, she found an\r\nodd-looking dark stone.\r\n\r\nInvestigation showed that this stone had indeed fallen through the roof.\r\nIt had made a neat round hole in four overlapping thicknesses of slate,\r\nshattered the underlying lath, made a dent in the lower edge of an\r\nH-section iron girder, and had finally broken through the plaster\r\nceiling into the hotel’s upstairs lounge.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was clear that the stone had come through the roof, the\r\nhotel manager did not connect the event in any way with the peculiar\r\nnoises he had heard during the preceding night.\r\n\r\nHe tried to cut the stone on an emery wheel, but it was too hard.\r\n\r\nThat evening, an old miner in the hotel restaurant recognized the stone\r\nas a meteorite. Many years before, he had visited a museum and had seen\r\nspecimens of meteorites on display there.\r\n\r\nThe slabs of slate penetrated by the meteorite would have provided good\r\nevidence as to the speed of the cosmic missile at the time it struck the\r\nroof. But, unfortunately, these appear to have been thrown away at the\r\ntime the roof was repaired. This fact is mentioned to show that\r\nimportant scientific evidence is sometimes unwittingly destroyed before\r\ninvestigators can get a chance to examine it.\r\n\r\nAlong with the rapid increase in the number of man-made buildings has,\r\nof course, gone a simultaneous increase in the world’s population\r\nitself. A person does not present as large a target to a falling\r\nmeteorite as a house or barn, but even so, if there were enough people\r\non the earth, it would seem that someone was bound to be hit sooner or\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:                              G.

Even then, the hit was\r\nan indirect one. At Sylacauga, Alabama, a meteorite fell through the\r\nroof of a house, went through the ceiling of the living room, struck the\r\ntop of a radio, and—bouncing in a 6-foot arc—hit the lady of the house,\r\nwho was taking a nap on the couch. Fortunately, nearly all of the energy\r\nof the meteorite was spent by the time it struck the woman, and,\r\nmoreover, she was covered with two heavy quilts so that she was not\r\ncritically injured. But she did receive bruises serious enough to send\r\nher to the hospital.\r\n\r\nThe instances just given show that a number of meteorites have struck\r\nbuildings and, in one case, a cosmic missile has hit a human being.\r\nNevertheless, such events are really quite rare. In fact, mathematical\r\ncalculations indicate that, on the average, we can expect one meteorite\r\nto fall per township (36 square miles) per 1000 years.

FINDERS FOOLISH, FINDERS WISE\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople find a great many meteorites that were not seen to fall. Most of\r\nthese landed on the surface of the earth at some time in the remote past\r\nor happened to fall in an originally unpopulated portion of the land\r\narea of the globe. Generally, such meteorites are discovered entirely by\r\naccident, although in recent years quite a few recoveries of unwitnessed\r\nfalls have been made by design. This has been the case during the\r\nsystematic surveys with meteorite detectors conducted around such\r\nrecognized meteorite crater areas as Canyon Diablo, Arizona; Odessa,\r\nTexas; and Wolf Creek, Australia.\r\n\r\nThe different modes of discovery of meteorites not seen to fall are\r\ninteresting in themselves. The largest percentage of finds has\r\nunquestionably been made by farmers. The Plymouth, Indiana, meteorite,\r\nfor example, was plowed up or, as the farmer nursing the rib bruised by\r\nhis bucking plow would probably prefer to say, “plowed into.” So were\r\nsuch meteorites as the Algoma, Wisconsin; the Bridgewater, North\r\nCarolina; the Carlton, Texas; and the Chesterfield, South Carolina, to\r\nname only a few. A farmer found the Kenton, Kentucky, iron while he was\r\ncleaning out a spring. Another farmer was removing debris from an\r\nabandoned water well in an attempt to revive it when he discovered the\r\nRichland, Texas, iron. A field drainage project brought the Seeläsgen,\r\nPoland, iron to light. A man planting an apple tree near his house dug\r\nout the Mount Joy, Pennsylvania, iron, and a farmer hoeing tobacco\r\nturned up the Scottsville, Kentucky, iron.\r\n\r\nThe second largest percentage of finds probably has been made by miners.\r\nProspectors and placer miners have mistaken numerous iron meteorites for\r\nlumps of silver ore. Among these are the Murfreesboro, Tennessee; Lick\r\nCreek, North Carolina; and Illinois Gulch, Montana, irons. The Aggie\r\nCreek, Alaska, iron was raised by a gold dredge. The gold miners\r\nrecognized this meteorite as an unusual “haul” when it announced its\r\npresence by clanging loudly on the metallic screen of the dredge.\r\n\r\nMen at work on road construction are also to be thanked for chancing\r\nupon meteorites of unwitnessed fall, for example, the irons found by\r\nroad crews at Bear Lodge, Wyoming, and at Bald Eagle, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nSome meteorites have been “found twice.” At Opava, Czechoslovakia,\r\narcheologists discovered seven pieces of meteoritic iron in a buried\r\nStone Age campsite—the oldest meteorite collection so far on record!\r\nApparently the paleolithic inhabitants of the Opava region had gathered\r\nthe heavy masses together and used them to bolster the fireplaces in\r\ntheir rude encampment.\r\n\r\nInvestigators discovered the Mesaverde, Colorado, iron in the Sun Shrine\r\non the north side of the Pipe Shrine House, and the Casas Grandes,\r\nMexico, iron in the middle of a large room of the Montezuma temple\r\nruins, carefully wrapped in linen cloth like a mummy. Members of an\r\nearly archeological survey found the small Anderson Township, Ohio,\r\nmeteoritic specimens on altars in mounds of the Little Miami Valley\r\ngroup of prehistoric earthworks. Some scientists believe that the\r\nAmerican Indians transported these specimens to Ohio from the site of\r\nthe Brenham meteorites in Kiowa County, Kansas.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Lake Murray, Oklahoma, iron meteorite in place,\r\n    just as it was found. See p. 80.]\r\n\r\nOther modes of discovery fall into no pattern and must be regarded as\r\nmerely curious. A farmer plowing his field near Pittsburgh,\r\nPennsylvania, came across a snake. In looking for a suitable stone with\r\nwhich to kill it, he first seized upon a mass of iron too heavy to lift.\r\nAfter he had killed the snake with a handy rock, the farmer’s attention\r\nwas drawn back to the small but remarkably heavy mass he had first tried\r\nto pick up. He carted it off to the city, where eventually it was\r\nrecognized as a meteorite.\r\n\r\nIn another unusual recovery, fishermen brought the Lake Okeechobee,\r\nFlorida, stone up from the waters of the lake in a net—the only such\r\nrecovery recorded in the whole literature of meteoritics, although\r\nthree-fourths of all meteorites must necessarily fall into water on our\r\nocean-covered globe. Again, the members of the Australasian Antarctic\r\nExpedition of 1911-1914 were surprised to find the Adelie Land,\r\nAntarctica, stone lying on the snow some 20 miles west of Cape Denison.\r\n\r\nBecause the true nature of meteorite finds has often been\r\nunrecognized—sometimes for many years—these masses have been put to some\r\nrather lowly uses. The finder of the Rafrüti, Switzerland, iron\r\nmeteorite used it as a footwarmer, and many of the heavy irons have been\r\nemployed as haystack, fence, and barrel-cover weights, or as anvils,\r\nnutcrackers, and doorstops.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: It’s a whopper! See p. 80.]\r\n\r\nSome have fared better, as did the 1,375-pound La Caille, France,\r\nmeteorite, which the people of the village used for two centuries as a\r\nseat in front of their church. Others, however, have fared even worse.\r\nBlacksmiths and assayers have smelted up and destroyed a number of iron\r\nmeteorites either in the making of tools (like plowshares, axe-heads,\r\nand knife-blades) or in the quest for precious metals. Nearly all of the\r\niron meteorite that was found by the farmer near Pittsburgh was worked\r\nup by a blacksmith and lost to science. Even the stone meteorites have\r\noccasionally fallen victims to man’s greed for gold. Miners who believed\r\nthat the 80-pound San Emigdio, California, stony meteorite was\r\ngold-bearing mashed it to powder in an ore-crusher.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, people who, in one way or another, have become\r\nacquainted with the characteristics of meteorites have brought a number\r\nof these objects to the attention of scientists. For example, one of the\r\nUniversity of Nebraska men who worked on the excavation and removal of\r\nthe large Furnas County stone meteorite (see Chapter 2) became keenly\r\ninterested at that time in meteorites in general, and took the trouble\r\nto learn as much as he could about them. Several years later, after he\r\nhad become director of a state park museum in southern Oklahoma, a large\r\nmetallic mass was reported to him. The finder of this mass of metal had\r\nknown of its existence for some 20 years, but had never succeeded in\r\ngetting anyone to examine it carefully. The former field worker took one\r\nlook at the object and, on the basis of his knowledge of meteorites,\r\nconcluded that it probably was a huge iron meteorite. He immediately\r\ncalled the Institute of Meteoritics by long distance and was able to\r\ngive such a wealth of significant details that a field party left at\r\nonce for the site. In this way, the Lake Murray, Oklahoma, meteorite was\r\nidentified and recovered.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Lake Murray core mounted on the meteorite saw\r\n    which cut it in half. One of the worn soft iron saw-blades is held\r\n    above the meteorite by the saw guides. See pp. 167, 168.]\r\n\r\nThe unoxidized central core of this iron weighed more than 600 pounds.\r\nBefore excavation this core was surrounded by a “shell” of oxidized\r\nmeteoritic material several inches thick, as shown on page 77. Such a\r\nshell of oxide clearly indicated that the meteorite had been subjected\r\nto weathering in the ground for many thousands of years.\r\n\r\nIn general, meteorites _seen to fall_—possibly because of the magnitude\r\nand impressiveness of the light and sound effects connected with their\r\ndescent—have received respectful treatment after recovery. Most of them\r\nhave been presented to men of science for study and eventual display in\r\nsome museum collection. Even when kept by their finders, the specimens\r\nusually have been well cared for. After the fall of the Flows, North\r\nCarolina, meteorite in 1849, the owner of the land on which it came down\r\nset the stone in a place of honor on top of a barrel fixed to a post. On\r\nthe post he put up the notice:\r\n\r\n  “_Gentlemen, sirs—please not to break this rock, which fell from the\r\n  skies and weighs 19.5 pounds._”\r\n\r\nThis landowner obviously realized that nearly everyone has the\r\nunfortunate urge to hammer on strange rocks.\r\n\r\nOf course, there have been exceptions to the respectful treatment of\r\nmeteorites seen to fall. The finder of one fragment of the Zhovtnevy\r\nHutor, Russia, fall tossed it into the stove, and a farm woman lost\r\nanother by throwing it at an unruly horse. A peasant who thought\r\nmeteorites possessed miraculous powers powdered up a piece of the\r\ndiamond-bearing Novo-Urei, Russia, stone and ate it!\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A polished and etched face of the Lake Murray\r\n    meteorite. The length of the cut is a good 23 inches.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   7. LANDMARKS, SKYMARKS & DETECTORS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chemist can easily obtain materials for his research work from\r\nreliable supply houses. The meteoriticist (as a scientist who studies\r\nmeteors and meteorites is known), is not this lucky. He must search for\r\nthe specimens he wishes to investigate wherever they may have landed on\r\nthe wide, wide earth. This “needle-in-a-haystack” problem could rarely\r\nbe solved if it were not for certain mathematical and instrumental aids\r\nthat swing the balance in favor of the meteorite hunter. When meteorites\r\nare seen to fall, these aids can be brought into play only if certain\r\ninformation is supplied by eyewitnesses of the falls. For this reason,\r\neveryone ought to be acquainted with the facts about meteorite falls\r\nthat scientists will need to know in order to make finds, and should\r\nunderstand how these facts must be reported in order to be of maximum\r\nuse to field parties.[5]\r\n\r\nThe problem of working out the path a fireball has followed in the sky\r\nboils down to this. The investigating scientists must be able to fix the\r\nposition _in space_ of certain important points on the fireball’s path.\r\nThis idea of fixing points is not really difficult at all. Suppose, to\r\ntake an analogy from baseball, we have base runners on first and third.\r\nThese two players are intently watching their team’s clean-up hitter,\r\nwho is “crowding the plate.” Consequently their lines of sight intersect\r\nat home plate and give a very good “fix on” its position, as navigators\r\nsay. This is the way a fix can be obtained in _two_ dimensions; that is,\r\nessentially, in the plane of the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A. A fix determined in two dimensions. The lines of\r\n    sight of the runners on first and third intersect at x.\r\n\r\n    B. A fix determined in three dimensions. The lines of sight of the\r\n    runners on the first and third intersect at x.]\r\n\r\nNow, let us move into the _third_ dimension, since a fireball’s path\r\nthrough the atmosphere lies in space, not in the “flat” plane of the\r\nearth’s surface. Returning to our baseball diamond, let us suppose that\r\na helicopter with an enterprising photographer aboard hovers over the\r\ncenterfield bleachers so that he can take pictures of the record crowd.\r\nWhile the umpire is dusting off home plate, the two runners on first and\r\nthird simultaneously sneak a look to see what the helicopter is doing.\r\nTheir lines of sight now intersect at the helicopter and fix its\r\nposition _in space_.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the location of a fireball path in space is determined by the\r\nfixing of certain points on the luminous streak seen in the sky. Instead\r\nof using only two intersecting lines of sight (those of the runners on\r\nfirst and third in our analogy), scientists investigating a meteorite\r\nfall try to collect as many different lines of sight as possible from\r\npeople in the region above which the fireball streaked. The more\r\ncommonly determined points are those of the fireball’s appearance and\r\ndisappearance and those where “explosions” took place. These points are\r\ngenerally located by use of the method we have described in some detail\r\nabove, the so-called _intersecting-lines-of-sight_ method.\r\n\r\nThe most important point on a fireball path is the point of\r\ndisappearance. The most valuable single piece of information you can\r\nsupply about a meteorite fall is as accurate an answer as possible to\r\nthe question: In what compass direction were you looking when you _last_\r\nsaw the fireball? This question has often been twisted around in\r\nnewspaper and radio accounts into the meaningless question: In what\r\ndirection was the fireball going when you saw it?\r\n\r\nOne person cannot give the answer to the second question because from a\r\nsingle station it is impossible to determine the _true_ direction of\r\nmotion of an object seen in the sky. One person can report only an\r\n_apparent_ direction of motion, which is of little or no value in\r\nlocating the last point on the luminous path, generally referred to as\r\nthe “end-point.” Therefore, though you cannot by yourself determine the\r\nactual direction in which a fireball is _moving_, you can report the\r\ndirection in which you were _looking_ when you last saw the fireball,\r\nthat is, due south, southwest, northeast, etc.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: O is an observer squinting along the top of a\r\n    ping-pong table. A ping-pong ball rolls along the top of the table\r\n    from B (beginning) to E (end). To the observer at O, however, the\r\n    ball would appear to start at B and end at E if it rolled along any\r\n    one of the dashed lines leading from OB to OE. By means of a similar\r\n    space-figure, it can be shown that a single observer at O cannot\r\n    determine the _true_ direction of motion of a luminous object in the\r\n    sky, like a meteor.]\r\n\r\nScientists are eager to obtain reliable reports on the compass direction\r\nto the fireball’s point of disappearance from as many widely separated\r\neyewitnesses as possible. They then can plot the individual lines of\r\nsight on a good map, marking exactly where these lines intersect. In\r\nthis way, the investigators can make reasonably accurate fixes of the\r\nposition of the point on the earth’s surface that is situated directly\r\nbelow the end-point of the fireball path, as this end-point was seen in\r\nthe sky by each pair of eyewitnesses.\r\n\r\nInstead of using the ordinary compass direction to a fireball’s point of\r\ndisappearance, you may prefer, as do astronomers, to use the azimuth.\r\nWhat we have been calling a “compass direction” is one that is expressed\r\nin terms of the cardinal points: north, south, east, west. An azimuth is\r\na direction stated in _degrees_. Rough azimuths can be taken with a\r\ncompass, but for accurate work, a graduated circle, like that on a\r\ntransit or theodolite, must be used. Astronomical azimuths begin at the\r\n_south_ point and continue clockwise full circle to 360°. For example,\r\nthe lines of sight in the diagram, p. 87, could very well have been\r\ngiven as astronomical azimuths. And, in the diagram, p. 91, the line of\r\nsight C₁ could have had the precise designation 118° and C₂ that of\r\n222°.\r\n\r\nEvery fix serves to guide field parties to areas that are to be\r\ncarefully searched for fallen meteorites. Extra-thorough searches are\r\nmade if the people living in a particular area reported that they heard\r\nmeteorite fragments hissing and whining on their way to earth or heard\r\nthe thumps of their impacts on the ground.\r\n\r\nYou will notice that so far we have been treating our problem as a\r\ntwo-dimensional one. We have been working with _directions_ only and\r\nhave plotted out direction indicators on a map representing the plane of\r\nthe earth’s surface. Now, as we did in our baseball analogy, let us move\r\ninto the third dimension.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Diagram (not drawn to scale) showing plotted compass\r\n    directions to the last visible point on a fireball path. (The point\r\n    denoted by L in next diagram.) Black dots represent positions of\r\n    various observers. Each arrowed line is directed toward the last\r\n    visible point as it was estimated by the individual observer. The\r\n    oval area, which includes points of intersection of all observed\r\n    lines of sight taken in pairs, marks out region in which meteorites\r\n    have probably fallen.]\r\n\r\nIf, in addition to compass directions to the observed endpoint,\r\nscientists can also obtain the apparent _elevation_, in degrees, of this\r\npoint as seen by the various eyewitnesses, then with the help of a\r\nlittle trigonometry, they can fix the position _in space_ of the\r\nend-point itself rather than the position of its _projection_ on the\r\nsurface of the earth.\r\n\r\nThis same procedure can be followed in fixing the space-position of any\r\nwell-observed point on the fireball path. It therefore becomes possible\r\nwhen _both_ elevations and compass directions are reported for several\r\npoints on the fireball path to determine the flight-path or, as it is\r\ntechnically called, the _trajectory_, of the falling meteorite through\r\nthe atmosphere. Trajectory determinations are of great scientific value.\r\n\r\nYou can estimate the compass directions and elevations to the important\r\npoints on a meteorite trajectory at the actual time of fall. Or you can\r\nhave the scientific field party make or check your measurement at some\r\nlater time by setting up a surveying instrument at the very point from\r\nwhich you saw the fireball.\r\n\r\nThe accuracy of your measurements can be improved if you have been able\r\nto “line up” the point, L, at which you saw the fireball disappear, with\r\nsome familiar object on the horizon, such as a church steeple, a tall\r\ntree, a telephone pole, or a lightning rod on a farm building. You will\r\nrecall that an eleven-year old girl provided one of the field parties\r\nfrom the Institute of Meteoritics with an excellent observation of the\r\npoint of disappearance of the Norton fireball. She was able to do this\r\nbecause she remembered just where it went out of sight behind a familiar\r\nlandmark.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Method for locating a point on a fireball path. (In\r\n    this case the point of disappearance, L.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  O₁ First observer.\r\n  A₁ Apparent height of point of disappearance (50°).\r\n  C₁ Compass direction of point of disappearance (N 62° W).\r\n  O₂ Second observer.\r\n  A₂ Apparent height of point of disappearance (45°).\r\n  C₂ Compass direction of point of disappearance (N 42° E).]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the fall occurs at night, you can help investigators greatly if you\r\nare familiar enough with the brighter stars to use them as “skymarks.”\r\nYou simply note as quickly and sharply as you can just where the\r\nfireball path was in reference to those prominent stars. This alert\r\nobservation of yours will at least be a great aid to investigators who\r\nare searching for meteorites that may have fallen from the fireball;\r\nand, moreover, there is no telling what else your quick eye might have\r\ncaptured for science.\r\n\r\nWhile looking through a window, Kayser, the Polish astronomer, saw a\r\nfireball appear at Rigel and move to Sirius, where it disappeared. This\r\nobservation of his proved to be one of the most accurate and\r\n_significant_ ever made of the fall of a meteorite. For it enabled the\r\nGerman mathematician, Galle, to show that the Pultusk meteorite, which\r\nproduced the fireball Kayser saw, came into the Solar System from\r\ninterstellar space!\r\n\r\nIt is very essential to carefully notice and mark the exact spot from\r\nwhich your observation was made so that you can return to it if\r\nscientists wish to set up surveying instruments there.\r\n\r\nThe map and side view of the Norton County, Kansas, meteorite trajectory\r\nshow the practical results that the Institute obtained by use of the\r\nintersecting-lines-of-sight method. The fireball accompanying the Norton\r\nmeteorite fall appeared at A. The first “explosion” took place at E₁,\r\nthe second at E₂, and the fireball disappeared at L.\r\n\r\nIf markers were dropped straight down to earth from each point along the\r\ntrajectory or flight-path of a meteorite through the atmosphere, the\r\nline joining the points where the markers fell would be the\r\n_earth-trace_ of this trajectory. The directions of sight to these\r\nvarious points are indicated for people living in the towns along and\r\nnear the earth-trace of the Norton meteorite fall. The solid-line arrows\r\nrepresent the direction of the point of disappearance; the dotted-line\r\narrows, the point of appearance; the dash-dot arrows, E₁; and the dashed\r\narrows, E₂. The probable area of fall is shown as an oval-shaped area,\r\nthe longer axis of which is identical with the direction of motion of\r\nthe meteorite.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Path of the Norton meteorite.]\r\n\r\nThe many fragments of all sizes recovered from the Norton fall were all\r\nfound within the bounds of this oval-shaped area, although unavoidable\r\nerrors of observation placed the center of the oval about 4 miles too\r\nfar to the north.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the questions about direction and elevation, there are a\r\nfew more that investigators of meteorite falls would like to have\r\nobservers answer.\r\n\r\n  At what time (determined as accurately as possible) did the fall\r\n  occur? Knowledge of this time is necessary if the path in which the\r\n  meteorite was moving about the sun is to be calculated by scientists.\r\n\r\n  Did you hear any sounds, either while you were watching the fireball\r\n  or after it disappeared? If you heard such sounds as the whining or\r\n  hissing of meteorite fragments flying through the air or the heavy\r\n  thumps of their impacts on the earth, then you were very close to\r\n  where the meteorite came down!\r\n\r\n  How many minutes and seconds (again determined as accurately as you\r\n  can) passed between the time when you saw the fireball vanish and the\r\n  instant when you first heard sounds from it? Such sound data permit\r\n  rough determination of the distance from the observer to the point\r\n  where the meteorite fell.\r\n\r\n  How long did the sounds set up by the meteorite last, and in what\r\n  direction did these sounds seem to die out?\r\n\r\nIf you or your neighbors find fragments that you suspect are pieces of\r\nthe meteorite, these specimens should be shown to the investigating\r\nfield parties at once—preferably undisturbed and in the very places\r\nwhere they fell. In any event, the suspect masses should not be hammered\r\non and broken up! Even as late as 1958 in a country as science-conscious\r\nas Germany, a beautiful stony meteorite, seen to fall and speedily found\r\nby an alert group of children playing out of doors, was deliberately\r\nbroken up into 5 pieces in order that each of the children (aged 9 years\r\nand up) might take home a “souvenir” of the event. Later, these pieces\r\nhad to be laboriously reassembled by scientists before any idea could be\r\ngained of the original shape and surface features of the meteorite.\r\n\r\nEven when thorough searches are made, not all the meteorite fragments in\r\nthe area of fall may be found for many months. But if the people living\r\nin the region have been alerted and are on the lookout for unusual\r\nspecimens or signs of meteoritic impact (such as freshly made holes or\r\n“craters” in the ground, shattered tree limbs, and so forth), the\r\nchances of ultimately finding many or most of the fallen masses are\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nAs we have already mentioned, numerous fragments of the Norton meteorite\r\n(including one weighing 130 pounds) were found within two to three\r\nmonths after its fall on February 18, 1948. But the main mass was not\r\ndiscovered until the following August, when a caterpillar tractor nearly\r\ntipped over into the large impact funnel that this huge stone had made\r\nin the earth. Fortunately, field searchers from the Institute had\r\nalready talked to one of the farmers using the tractor and had told him\r\nthat just such a “crater” might be found in the very area under\r\ncultivation. Consequently, the crater was promptly reported.\r\n\r\nIn surveys concerned with the location and recovery of meteorites _not_\r\nseen to fall, we find that sometimes meteorite fragments, particularly\r\nthe smaller ones, lie on the surface of the ground or at shallow depth.\r\nSuch fragments were probably too light to penetrate deep into the ground\r\nor, in the years since their fall, the action of rain, wind, and frost\r\nhas uncovered them.\r\n\r\nIn such cases, a party of searchers generally spreads out in order to\r\nget over as much ground as possible and each member of the group looks\r\nfor meteorite specimens without using instrumental aids. Visual searches\r\nof this type have been very successful, for example, around the Canyon\r\nDiablo crater, where almost the entire plain out to several miles from\r\nthe rim once was sprinkled with large and small fragments of meteoritic\r\nnickel-iron. This type of meteorite hunt is of only limited\r\neffectiveness because the specimens (or at least a part of each one)\r\nmust be visible to the searchers.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Collecting small surface specimens of meteorites with\r\n    portable detecting devices: a powerful alnico magnet mounted on a\r\n    light wooden sled, and a horseshoe magnet at the end of a cane. See\r\n    p. 98.]\r\n\r\nTo increase recoveries, searchers have employed, in addition to their\r\neyes, various types of permanent magnets, either mounted on the end of a\r\ncane and used to probe the upper few inches of loose soil, or dragged\r\nbehind the searcher on a small, light sled. Meteorite hunters have also\r\nused more powerful portable electromagnets to collect large amounts of\r\nmeteoritic material (both solid iron and iron-shale) not only from the\r\nsurface but also from shallow depths. Even the best of these simple\r\nmagnetic devices, however, are useless in the detection of really deeply\r\nburied meteoritic material.\r\n\r\nMeteorites do not merely fall upon the earth (as most astronomical\r\ntextbooks still insist), but usually penetrate into it—often quite\r\ndeeply. In fact, one of our mathematical investigations showed that\r\nperhaps 100,000 times as much meteoritic nickel-iron is concentrated\r\nbelow maximum plow-depth (approximately one foot) as lies above that\r\ndepth. Clearly, some form of instrument capable of detecting deeply\r\nburied meteorites needed to be devised if this wealth of buried material\r\nwas not to be lost to science. This need was answered by the development\r\nof special _meteorite detectors_.\r\n\r\nAlthough meteorite detectors working on several different principles\r\nhave been constructed, we shall limit attention here to the simplest and\r\nmost field-worthy design. The essential principle on which it operates\r\nis one familiar to any Boy or Girl Scout who has used a magnetic\r\ncompass. The first lesson Scoutmasters teach is not to read compass\r\ndirections from such an instrument when it is held near a mass of iron\r\nof considerable size, such as an automobile. Such a large iron mass\r\nalters or distorts the local magnetic field of the earth on which the\r\ndirection-finding ability of the ordinary compass depends. It is this\r\nvery characteristic, so bothersome to the user of a compass, that is the\r\nprinciple on which meteorite detectors work. For if an electrically\r\ndriven meteorite detector capable of generating its own magnetic field\r\nis carried over a deeply buried iron meteorite, the instrument’s\r\nmagnetic field will be distorted by the presence of the metal mass, just\r\nas the local magnetic field of the earth was distorted by the metal of\r\nthe automobile.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A 146-pound iron, found by this girl without the use\r\n    of instruments although only a small corner of the meteorite was\r\n    visible above the surface of the ground.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A commercially built meteorite detector in\r\n    operation.]\r\n\r\nThe operator of such a meteorite detector wears earphones and watches a\r\nsignal needle in plain sight on the top panel of the detector. Since the\r\nphone and signal-needle circuits of the meteorite detector are _in\r\nbalance_ only when the magnetic field generated by the detector is\r\nundistorted, the disturbing presence of a deeply buried meteorite is at\r\nonce revealed by a shrill note sounding in the earphones and\r\nsimultaneous motion of the signal needle. If, as in all buried treasure\r\nstories, we use “X” to stand for the spot where the signals from the\r\ndetector are strongest, then the meteorite-hunter has only to dig deep\r\nenough at “X” to recover the celestial treasure-trove he is after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        8. THE NATURE OF METEORS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn answer to an exam question, a freshman astronomy student wrote:\r\n\r\n  A _meteor_ is the flash of light\r\n  Made by a falling _meteorite_\r\n  As it rushes through the air in flight—\r\n  I hope to gosh this answer’s right!\r\n\r\nDoggerel or not, the student’s definition correctly stated the true\r\ndistinction between the two terms, and the teacher marked his off-beat\r\nanswer correct.\r\n\r\nDefined in more scientific terms, a meteor is the streak of light\r\n(usually of brief duration) that accompanies the flight of a particle of\r\nmatter from outer space through our atmosphere. This particle may be as\r\nsmall as a tiny dust grain or as large as one of the minor planets which\r\nare called asteroids. Fortunately for the inhabitants of the earth, most\r\nof the meteor-forming masses encountered by our globe are of the\r\n“small-fry” variety!\r\n\r\nAs the rapidly moving particle plunges earthward through denser and\r\ndenser layers of atmosphere, the air molecules offer ever-increasing\r\nresistance to its passage. This resistance heats up the meteorite body\r\nuntil it glows. Technically speaking, it becomes incandescent. _The\r\nmeteor is this incandescence._ We see it as a darting point. Or as a\r\nball of white, orange, bluish, or reddish light. But the _material\r\nobject_ that produced this light is the _meteorite_. The distinction\r\nbetween these two terms—meteor and meteorite—we must emphasize again and\r\nagain because people continue to use them incorrectly, as, for instance,\r\nwhen they keep saying “meteor crater” instead of “meteorite crater.”\r\n\r\nThe majority of the meteors we observe represent the heat-induced\r\n“evaporation” of exceedingly small fragments of cosmic matter. The\r\nsmallest meteor-forming bodies reach the surface of the earth only as\r\nthe finest of dust particles or as microscopic droplets of solidified\r\nmeteorite melt.\r\n\r\nThese residues descend slowly through the atmosphere and may be carried\r\nfor great distances. Afterwards, they may be found scattered so widely\r\nand uniformly on the ground that their presence in any given locality\r\ncannot be accounted for by the fall of any specific meteorite. This is a\r\nfact that, for example, one school of modern Russian meteoriticists\r\noverlooked when they were dealing with tiny granules of meteoritic dust\r\nthat had been recently found at Podkamennaya Tunguska. These scientists\r\ntried to identify the tiny granules with the meteorite that had fallen\r\nthere, June 30, 1908. But the members of the latest (1958) Russian\r\nexpedition to that region about the impact point of 1908 clearly\r\nrecognize the widespread character of meteoritic dust. So they reject\r\nthe theory that such dust found in the Podkamennaya Tunguska area is\r\nspecifically connected with the meteorite that fell there a half century\r\nago.\r\n\r\nIf sizable chunks of meteoritic material enter the atmosphere, they may\r\nproduce exceptionally large and brilliant meteors. A spectacular meteor\r\nis generally known as a “fireball” if it is as bright as Venus or\r\nJupiter. It receives the French term _bolide_ if, in addition to showing\r\ngreat brilliance, its flight is accompanied by detonations like the\r\nalarming sounds heard at the time of the Ussuri and Norton meteorite\r\nfalls.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:            COURTESY OF UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO PRESS\r\n     A bright Giacobinid meteor, photographed from a B-29 during the\r\n    shower of October 9, 1946. See p. 115.]\r\n\r\nThe term “shooting star,” which is often applied to meteors, in\r\nnewspapers and magazine articles, is a misnomer. A meteor is _not_ a\r\ndistant sun (that is, a star) in rapid motion, for the whole path of the\r\nmeteor lies close at hand within a restricted zone of the earth’s\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe word “meteor” comes from the Greek word _meteōra_, which once\r\napplied to any natural occurrence _in the atmosphere_—for example,\r\nrainbows, halos, auroras, and so forth. Nowadays, the word “meteor” is\r\nused in a much more specialized sense than it was by the ancient Greeks.\r\nWe have a specialized word, _meteoritics_, for the study of meteors and\r\nmeteorites. No one should confuse meteoritics with _meteorology_, which\r\nis the science of things _other_ than meteors and meteorites, in the\r\natmosphere—for example, clouds, storms, air currents.\r\n\r\nThe region in which meteoric phenomena take place was long the subject\r\nof controversy. Some persons felt that meteors were nearby, like\r\nlightning. Others said that they moved at the distances of the remote\r\nfixed stars. This controversy on the whereabouts of meteors became\r\nheated, although it could have been settled quickly by a simple\r\nexperiment you can try out for yourself.\r\n\r\nHold a pencil against the tip of your nose and look at it first with\r\nyour right eye closed and then with your left eye closed. Repeat this\r\nexperiment with the pencil held at arm’s length. In the first case, the\r\npencil will seem to shift position very greatly; in the second, although\r\nthe same base line (the distance between your eyes) is used, the pencil\r\nwill seem to shift position only slightly.\r\n\r\nSuch an apparent shift in position is called a _parallactic\r\ndisplacement_, or, simply, _parallax_. The notion of parallax is of the\r\ngreatest importance in most branches of astronomy, and it leads (with\r\nproper instruments and a little mathematics) to exact determinations of\r\nthe distances of remote objects.\r\n\r\nFor our purpose, we need not go into all the interesting but complicated\r\ndetails. Our experiment with the pencil shows that if a meteor was close\r\nby, like a blinding bolt of lightning, then, as seen by a pair of\r\nobservers separated by only a few blocks, the meteor would show a large\r\nparallax. But if this meteor was as far away as the stars, it would show\r\nno parallax at all, no matter how widely the pair of observers were\r\nseparated on the earth.\r\n\r\nThere were many clever scientists among the Greeks, and it is quite\r\npossible that a pair of them actually tried out this simple parallax\r\nexperiment on the meteors and so were able to prove that these beautiful\r\nlight effects occurred in the high but not too distant layers of the\r\natmosphere. The earliest calculations of meteor heights that are so far\r\nknown, however, were made in Bologna, Italy, in 1719 and 1745—long after\r\nthe heyday of Greek science.\r\n\r\nThe meteor heights found by the Italians were quite low in the\r\natmosphere, probably for two reasons. First, the visual (unaided-eye)\r\nobservations they had to use were made by eyewitnesses stationed so\r\nclose together that accurate fixes were impossible. Secondly, these\r\nvisual observations must have related only to the very brightest and\r\ntherefore lowest portions of the luminous paths of the meteors through\r\nthe atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn 1798, two German students operating from carefully chosen and widely\r\nseparated stations began the systematic observation of meteors for\r\nparallax. They found that the height of appearance of most meteors lay\r\nbetween 48 and 60 miles above the earth’s surface. It is now known that\r\nmost meteors, as observed with the naked eye, appear at about 70 miles\r\nand disappear at about 50 miles above the surface of the earth. These\r\nfigures, obtained from visual work, still stand in spite of the\r\ndevelopment of such modern techniques as photographic and radar\r\nrecording of meteor paths.\r\n\r\nRarely, meteors may appear at heights of 150 or more miles and fireballs\r\nmay penetrate to within a few miles of the earth. The average meteors,\r\nhowever, appear and disappear within a well-defined, high-altitude zone\r\nin the atmosphere. Fortunately, this atmospheric zone serves us as an\r\neffective shield against the constant bombardment of the smaller and\r\nmuch more numerous particles from outer space.\r\n\r\nIn earlier times, scientists thought that the particles becoming visible\r\nas meteors must be tiny dense masses of iron or stone like the material\r\ncomposing the recovered meteorites. Most modern investigators, however,\r\nbelieve that the typical meteor-forming particles may be small loosely\r\nbound-together “dust-balls”; that is, fluffy clusters of matter held\r\ntogether by frozen cosmic vapors, generally referred to simply as\r\n“ices.” In any event, these masses are usually very small, ranging\r\nperhaps from the size of a pinhead to that of a marble.\r\n\r\nBecause we cannot collect the tiny masses that are seen only as meteors,\r\nit is impossible to determine their composition by ordinary laboratory\r\nmethods. The best we can do is to observe and record carefully the light\r\nthese masses give off when they become incandescent in their plunge\r\nthrough the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWe can examine this meteor light by using the spectroscope and\r\nspectrograph. Through these specially designed instruments we can make\r\nthe meteor light reveal the chemical elements present in the\r\nincandescent masses. Each such element sends out light rays as\r\ncharacteristic of its nature as fingerprints are of the individual who\r\nmade them. Photographs taken of these characteristic light rays are\r\ncalled _spectrograms_, and what might be termed the “fingerprints of\r\nlight” recorded on these spectrograms are known as _spectra_—which is\r\nthe plural of the word _spectrum_. If the source of light is a meteor,\r\nthe photograph shows a meteor spectrum.\r\n\r\nFrom a study of a considerable number of good quality meteor spectra,\r\nscientists have found that the principal elements in the masses\r\nresponsible for meteors are iron, calcium, manganese, magnesium,\r\nchromium, silicon, nickel, aluminum, and sodium.\r\n\r\nAs we have already noted, the resistance encountered by meteor-forming\r\nparticles as they dash through our atmosphere is so great that they\r\nbecome incandescent and vaporize. These small bodies must therefore be\r\nin very rapid motion.\r\n\r\nBefore we attempt to find out the nature of the paths in space followed\r\nby meteorites, we must take into account the fact that these bodies are\r\nobserved from a station—the earth—which is itself in rapid motion. You\r\nmay have noticed that on a still day, when rain drops fall vertically\r\ndownward, the streaks they leave on the windows of a swiftly moving car\r\nare not vertical but almost horizontal. Obviously, it would be wrong to\r\nsay the rain drops are falling from left to right or from right to left\r\nwhen they are actually falling almost straight down, and it is only the\r\nforward motion of the car that makes them leave horizontal streaks.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Diagram showing meteorite moving along a “closed”\r\n    (elliptic) orbit, e, which intersects the earth’s orbit, E. Held by\r\n    the gravitational attraction of the sun, the meteorite is a\r\n    permanent member of the Solar System.]\r\n\r\nSimilarly, neither the apparent speed nor the apparent direction of\r\nmotion of a meteorite with respect to the moving earth is significant.\r\nThe important factor is the meteorite’s velocity _with respect to the\r\nsun_ at the time the meteorite is picked up by the earth.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Diagram showing meteorite moving across the earth’s\r\n    orbit, E, along an “open” (hyperbolic) orbit, h. The meteorite is\r\n    traveling at such high velocity that it will pass right through the\r\n    Solar System and back out into space unless it should chance to\r\n    collide with the earth or another planet. The sun, however, in any\r\n    case is able to change materially the direction of motion of the\r\n    transient visitor to our Solar System.]\r\n\r\nThis factor enables us to determine in which of two possible kinds of\r\npath the meteorite was moving _before_ it was “fielded,” as we might say\r\nin baseball, by the earth. This factor tells us whether the meteorite\r\nwas moving about the sun in a relatively short, closed, oval-shaped path\r\nor, instead, was following an indefinitely long, open path which began\r\nin the depths of space and would have returned there if the collision\r\nwith the earth had not prevented.\r\n\r\nEither type of path is technically called an _orbit_. The closed orbits\r\nare what the mathematicians term _ellipses_; the open orbits,\r\n_hyperbolas_.\r\n\r\nTo scientists, the nature of the orbits followed by meteorites is most\r\nimportant, especially in efforts to determine the mode and place of\r\norigin of these bodies. To rocket engineers and astronauts, it also\r\nmatters a good deal whether the meteorites encountered on flights\r\nthrough space are traveling sedately along closed orbits about the sun\r\nor are zipping swiftly along open orbits.\r\n\r\nThe greater the speed of these cosmic “hot-rods,” the more dangerous\r\nthey are to space travelers. For example, a mere grain of nickel-iron\r\nmoving at 40 miles per second is quite as lethal as a .50-caliber\r\nmachine-gun slug, which, relatively speaking, is traveling at only a\r\nsnail’s pace.\r\n\r\nAs our earth moves along its orbit about the sun, meteoritic bodies can\r\nrun into it from any direction. The direction from which they do\r\napproach strongly influences the speed of these bodies as they plunge\r\nthrough the earth’s atmosphere. A meteorite moving slowly about the sun\r\nin the same direction as the earth and chancing to catch up with our\r\nglobe more or less from behind will have an observed speed of only a few\r\nmiles a second. For example, the speed calculated from Harvard\r\nmeteor-photographs of one such not-too-spectacular “rear-end” collision\r\namounted to no more than 7.3 miles per second, just about the speed a\r\nrocket must acquire to escape from the apron strings of Mother Earth.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Meteor shower. Earth and particle-swarm passing\r\n    through the intersection of their orbits at nearly the same moment.]\r\n\r\nIn contrast to such a “rear-end” collision, the speed observed would be\r\nfar greater if the meteorite happened to collide exactly “head-on” with\r\nthe earth. For, in this case, the orbital speed of our planet would be\r\n_added_ to that of the meteorite about the sun. As an example, suppose\r\nthat at the earth’s average distance from the center of our Solar\r\nSystem, the speed of a meteorite with respect to the sun were 32.23\r\nmiles per second. (This speed was actually found for the mass that\r\nproduced one of the first meteors photographed simultaneously by the\r\nHarvard stations at Cambridge and Oak Ridge, Massachusetts.) Then if\r\nsuch a meteorite ran “head-on” into the earth, the speed observed for it\r\nin the atmosphere would be over 51 miles per second. And mathematics\r\nwould show that the orbit of this meteorite with respect to the sun was\r\na wide open hyperbola.\r\n\r\nIf the orbit of the earth and the orbit of a swarm of particles of\r\ncosmic matter intersect, and if the earth and the swarm pass through\r\nthis intersection in space at nearly the same moment, multitudes of\r\nmeteors appear. We then say that a _meteor shower_ takes place. The\r\nposition of the point at which the particle-swarm crosses the earth’s\r\norbit about the sun fixes the date of the meteor shower.\r\n\r\nBecause the particles that make a meteor shower are moving through space\r\nalong parallel paths as they come into the earth’s atmosphere, the\r\nmeteors all seem to shoot out from a single small area in the sky. You\r\nmay have seen something like this in the case of the sunrise or sunset\r\neffect known as “the sun drawing water.” In this more familiar\r\nphenomenon, the sun’s disk is the area from which shafts of sunlight\r\nradiate out in a beautiful, if somewhat irregular, fan-like pattern. The\r\narea from which the meteors of a given shower seem to come is the\r\n_radiant_ of that shower.\r\n\r\nMeteor showers are named for the constellation in which their radiant\r\nlies. The suffix “-id” (Greek for “daughters of”), or some modification\r\nof this suffix, is added to the name of the constellation from which the\r\nmeteors seem to radiate. The Orionid radiant, for example, is in Orion,\r\nthe Hunter; the Leonid radiant is in Leo, the Lion; and the Lyrid\r\nradiant is in Lyra, the Harp. Exceptions to this rule do occur, however.\r\nAstronomers may refer to a shower sometimes appearing on the night of\r\nOctober 9 as the “Giacobinid” shower in honor of the comet\r\nGiacobini-Zinner, which is associated with this particle-swarm.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Radiant of a meteor shower. Generally not a point but\r\n    a small area, here intentionally exaggerated in size. Solid arrows\r\n    represent plotted paths of observed meteors. By extending these\r\n    paths backwards, observer can determine the radiant.]\r\n\r\nIn the course of each year, the earth passes through a number of\r\nparticle-swarms of varying densities. Some of the resulting meteor\r\nshowers, like the Leonids and Giacobinids, are very feeble in most\r\nyears, but sometimes produce spectacular displays.\r\n\r\nThe more important recognized meteor showers are:\r\n\r\n  NAME OF SHOWER                       DATE OF MAXIMUM\r\n  Quadrantids                          January 1-3\r\n  Lyrids                               April 21\r\n  Eta-Aquarids                         May 4-6\r\n  Perseids                             August 10-14\r\n  Giacobinids (Nu-Draconids)           October 9\r\n  Orionids                             October 20-23\r\n  Leonids                              November 16-17\r\n  Geminids                             December 12-13\r\n\r\nCertain daytime streams are also known to be active during June and\r\nJuly. These daytime showers are, of course, invisible in the glare of\r\nsunlight, but they can be picked up by radar devices like those used in\r\nWorld War II to spot enemy airplanes.\r\n\r\nSome meteor showers have been splendid enough to make a place for\r\nthemselves in the historical record. Examples are the Leonid returns of\r\n1833 and 1866, and the Giacobinid showers of 1933 and 1946. During these\r\ndisplays, meteors fell in a veritable fiery snowstorm, several hundred\r\nmeteors sometimes appearing within a minute.\r\n\r\nNot every annual return of a meteor shower is spectacular, however,\r\nsince conditions may not be favorable each year for a brilliant display.\r\nAfter all, both parties to a traffic collision at an intersection must\r\ntry to pass through the intersection at the same time. Our earth, like a\r\nwell-managed train, always goes through the intersection on schedule,\r\nbut the particles responsible for meteor showers are much more erratic.\r\nThey may be early or late—or they may not show up at all. Of the meteor\r\nshowers seen annually, the Perseids are the most dependable. The Leonids\r\nput on their best shows at intervals of 33 years (1799-1800, 1832-33,\r\n1866, etc.). The Giacobinids at intervals of 6½ years (1933, strong;\r\n1939-40, poor; 1946, magnificent).\r\n\r\nIf you plan to observe a meteor shower, here are some suggestions. You\r\nwill need:\r\n\r\n  Acquaintance with the stars, both faint and bright, in the region\r\n  containing the radiant of the shower.\r\n\r\n  Comfortable reclining lawn-chair.\r\n\r\n  Warm clothing (including blankets) for winter showers or summer ones\r\n  at high elevations.\r\n\r\n  A patient family that will not only approve of your observing but will\r\n  help you get up to watch after midnight, when most showers are at\r\n  their best.\r\n\r\n  A corner of your back yard (or sun roof) where you can shade your eyes\r\n  from street lights and other illumination.\r\n\r\n  Timepiece, preferably with radiant dial.\r\n\r\nSit back and watch Nature put on her show. Any records you make may have\r\nsome scientific value even if you note only these two things: Hourly\r\nnumber of meteors seen. Condition of the sky (clear, hazy, cloudy, etc.)\r\nduring each hour of your watch.[6] At present, we know of only one\r\ninstance in which it seems probable that a meteorite came to earth\r\nduring a meteor shower. The Mazapil, Mexico, iron meteorite fell at 9:00\r\np.m. on November 27, 1885, during a return of the now very weak Bielid\r\nmeteor shower. Scientists still cannot decide whether or not a mere\r\ncoincidence was involved in this case.\r\n\r\nAs we have already mentioned, most of the cosmic particles rushing into\r\nour atmosphere evaporate and do not reach the earth at all except as the\r\ntiny congealed droplets and spherules of their own melt. Some cosmic\r\nparticles, the _micro-meteorites_, are so tiny that they “stall” rather\r\nthan fall down. These minute objects do not melt or disintegrate and so\r\npreserve their original cosmic form unchanged. Scientists have developed\r\nvarious methods for the collection of both of these types of material in\r\norder that at least rough estimates of their rate of accumulation on the\r\nearth can be made.\r\n\r\nOne of the simplest methods of collecting this so-called “meteoritic\r\ndust” is to expose a sticky glycerine-coated glass microscope slide for\r\nat least a 24-hour period in a protected spot well away from locations\r\nwhere any industrial contamination is in the air. At the end of the\r\nperiod of exposure, the “catch” on the slide is examined\r\nmicroscopically, and the individual trapped particles are counted and\r\nclassified. Meteoritic dust is also carried down to the ground by rain,\r\nsnow, and hail and can therefore be obtained by filtering rainwater or\r\nmelted glacier-ice, snow, and hail.\r\n\r\nSuch collection efforts have been plagued by the difficulty of\r\nidentifying the particles. How can a collector be sure that the dust he\r\nhas trapped, even though magnetic and possibly even in part metallic,\r\ndoes not come from some smelter or other industrial plant? Because of\r\nsuch uncertainties, the current estimates of the annual deposit of\r\nmeteoritic dust for the world range from approximately 20 tons to\r\nseveral million tons. We need improved collection and identification\r\ntechniques if we are to obtain trustworthy figures.\r\n\r\nRecent analyses of rainfall records indicate that the infall of\r\nmeteoritic dust produces at least one interesting weather-effect. These\r\nanalyses show that rainfall peaks often occur some 30 days after the\r\nappearance of important meteor showers. Apparently, as meteoritic dust\r\nparticles from the meteor showers filter down through the cloud systems\r\nin the lower layers of the atmosphere, the individual particles serve as\r\ncenters about which atmospheric moisture condenses to form raindrops.\r\nThe time lag of approximately a month is considered to be due to the\r\nvery slow rate of fall of such tiny particles. It looks very much as if\r\nMother Nature had beaten man to the idea of “seeding” the clouds to\r\nproduce rainfall!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      9. THE NATURE OF METEORITES\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far in this book we have dealt with meteorites indirectly, chiefly in\r\nconnection with their fall, distribution, and recovery. In this chapter,\r\nhowever, we are shifting our attention to the meteorites themselves, and\r\nwill tell what the main types of meteorites are, what meteorites are\r\nmade of, what they look like, and how to tell them from ordinary rocks.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, meteorites neither all look alike nor have the same\r\ncomposition. The general term “meteorite” applies to any mass that\r\nreaches the earth from space. Such masses are made up of metals and\r\nminerals in varying proportions. The term “meteorite” is nearly as\r\ngeneral in meaning as the word “rock,” which geologists apply to bodies,\r\nlarge and small, that are formed by earth processes and are composed of\r\nvarious kinds of minerals. Actually, there are almost as many different\r\nkinds of meteorites as there are kinds of rocks; so you can see that in\r\nmeteorites a wide range of composition and appearance is possible.\r\n\r\nAll recognized meteorites belong to one of three main divisions,[7]\r\n_irons_, _stones_, and _stony-irons_.\r\n\r\nThe irons are composed of an alloy of iron and nickel which may contain\r\nsmall inclusions of nonmetallic minerals.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Internal structure revealed when the “etching”\r\n    process is applied to that type of meteorite known as a “granular\r\n    hexahedrite.” See p. 120.]\r\n\r\nAfter a cut section of an iron meteorite has been polished, the flat\r\nsurface, except for possible inclusions, is mirror-like and resembles\r\nstainless steel. It appears to be remarkably uniform and uninteresting,\r\nbut this appearance is misleading. A characteristic and beautiful\r\nstructural pattern develops when such a polished nickel-iron surface is\r\ntreated with, for example, a special mixture of nitric acid, alcohol,\r\nand Arabol glue.\r\n\r\nThis process of treatment is known as “etching.” The different\r\nstructural patterns brought out by such etching give us the basis for\r\nclassifying the iron meteorites.\r\n\r\nIf the etching process reveals certain features from which we can infer\r\na cubic, or 6-faced, crystalline structure, we classify the iron\r\nmeteorite as a _hexahedrite_.\r\n\r\nIf etching produces a certain special pattern from which we can infer an\r\n8-faced, or octahedral, crystalline structure, we recognize the second\r\nsubdivision of iron meteorites: the _octahedrites_. This remarkable\r\npattern was discovered and first described by Alois von Widmanstätten,\r\nof Vienna, in 1808.\r\n\r\nThe third subdivision of iron meteorites consists of the “structureless”\r\n_ataxites_. (From the Greek for “without arrangement.”) On an ataxite,\r\netching brings out only a finely granular pattern with a stippled\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThe _stones_ are composed chiefly of minerals that are combinations of\r\nvarious elements with silicon and oxygen—for example, olivine (Mg,\r\nFe)₂SiO₄. Meteorites belonging to this division also contain\r\ncombinations of elements with oxygen—such as magnesium oxide (MgO) and\r\naluminum oxide (Al₂O₃). Usually, the stony groundmass contains scattered\r\nspecks, grains, and thin veins of the same shiny nickel-iron alloy that\r\nmakes up the iron meteorites almost in their entirety.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:                           A.

A cut and polished\r\nsection of a pallasite showing round and oval gems of yellow-green\r\nolivine set in a silvery mesh of nickel-iron is a beautiful museum\r\nspecimen indeed!\r\n\r\nIn the _silicate-siderites_, another type of stony-iron, a nickel-iron\r\nmatrix is studded with angular fragments, shreds, and splinters of\r\nsilicate minerals of all sizes. In the photograph, we can see that each\r\nof the various areas of the nickel-iron matrix (lighter in color)\r\nexhibits its own distinct crystallographic orientation, as is clearly\r\nindicated by the different Widmanstätten patterns.\r\n\r\nEven a hasty comparison of polished sections of silicate-siderites and\r\npallasites will leave no doubt that two quite distinct modes of\r\nformation were required to produce stony-irons of such different types.\r\n\r\nMeteoritic nickel-iron has the following average chemical composition.\r\nTo the nearest tenth, this alloy contains: Iron (Fe), 90.9%; nickel\r\n(Ni), 8.5%; cobalt (Co), 0.6%. This alloy gave scientists the key to the\r\ndevelopment of commercial stainless steels. It may also contain small\r\namounts of phosphorous, sulfur, copper, chromium, and carbon.\r\n\r\nThe average chemical composition of stony meteoritic material is\r\nsomewhat more complicated. To the nearest tenth, the “stones” contain:\r\noxygen (O), 41.0%; silicon (Si), 21.0%; iron (Fe), 15.5%; magnesium\r\n(Mg), 14.3%; aluminum (Al), 1.6%; calcium (Ca), 1.8%; sulfur (S), 1.8%.\r\nThe stony material may also contain smaller percentages of nickel,\r\ncobalt, copper, carbon, chromium, and titanium.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:                           A.

On the average, each of these portions has about\r\nthe chemical composition that is given for it above.\r\n\r\nMineralogists have identified a variety of familiar minerals in\r\nmeteorites. These include olivine, the plagioclase feldspars, magnetite,\r\nquartz, chromite, and, rarely, microscopic diamonds. All of these\r\nminerals are found here on earth in such igneous rocks as basalts and\r\nperidotites.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the meteoritic nickel-iron alloys (kamacite, taenite,\r\nand plessite, for example) and such meteoritic minerals as schreibersite\r\n(nickel-iron phosphide) and daubreelite (iron chromium sulfide) do _not_\r\noccur naturally on the earth.\r\n\r\nWe should stress here that although unusual _combinations_ of known\r\nelements are present in meteorites, no new _elements_ have been\r\ndiscovered during the increasingly intensive study of these masses\r\nduring the last 150 years.\r\n\r\nThe majority of stony meteorites show a structure not found in\r\nterrestrial rocks. These meteorites are made up of rounded, shot-like\r\nbodies called _chondrules_ (from the Greek word for “grain”). The\r\nindividual chondrules may vary in size from those as large or even\r\nlarger than a walnut down to dust-sized grains. The most common size is\r\nabout that of peppercorns. The chondrules are often composed of the same\r\nmaterial as the groundmass in which they are imbedded and unless the\r\nmeteorite containing them is a very fragile one, they will break with\r\nthe rest of the mass, as will sand grains in a quartzite. If the\r\nmeteorite is fragile, however, the individual chondrules can generally\r\nbe broken out whole. Meteorites containing chondrules are called\r\n_chondrites_.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:        COURTESY OF AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY\r\n     Microphotograph of a thin section of a chondrite, showing the\r\n    circular, or nearly circular, cross sections of a number of\r\n    chondrules, including one of large size at the upper edge of the\r\n    section.]\r\n\r\nA small percentage of stony meteorites have no chondrules. These\r\nmeteorites are known as _achondrites_ (meaning “not chondrites”) and\r\nthey resemble terrestrial rocks more closely than the chondrites do.\r\nSome achondrites contain almost no trace whatever of metal, although in\r\nothers (for example, the Norton County meteorite, of Chapter 2) small\r\nlumps and specks of nickel-iron are sparsely distributed through the\r\nstony groundmass.\r\n\r\nMeteorites are as variable in shape as they are in composition and\r\nstructure. Many are cone-shaped; others shield-, bell-, or ring-shaped;\r\nstill others pear-shaped. One iron fragment recently recovered from the\r\nGlorieta, New Mexico, fall has been described as “macro-spicular,”\r\nmeaning needle-shaped on a very large scale. The photographs opposite\r\nillustrate a number of the commoner forms known. The Glorieta specimen\r\nhas been nicknamed “Alley Oop’s shillelagh,” for only a person of great\r\nstrength could wield this 13-pounder with ease!\r\n\r\nIn general, the shape of meteorites depends upon the amount of mass lost\r\nby “evaporation” during passage through the earth’s atmosphere. This\r\nfactor, in turn, depends not only upon the speed of transit, but also on\r\nsuch physical characteristics of the meteorite as its tensile strength\r\nand whether or not it contains certain alloys and minerals that vaporize\r\nmore easily than the rest of the meteorite. The ring-shape of the\r\nTucson, Arizona, iron is believed to have resulted from the “melting\r\naway” of a huge inclusion of stony material during the descent of the\r\nmeteorite.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:              CHICAGO MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY PHOTOS\r\n                           (BOTTOM RIGHT) INSTITUTE OF METEORITICS PHOTO\r\n     A few of the many shapes exhibited by meteorites: ring-shaped,\r\n    perforated and highly irregular, pear-shaped, jaw shaped,\r\n    needle-shaped.]\r\n\r\nWhen meteorites are recovered and taken to the laboratory for study, one\r\nof the first things scientists do is to weigh them. If a meteorite is\r\nvery large, special scales sometimes have to be constructed for this\r\npurpose. Such was the case for the largest meteorite so far weighed: the\r\ngiant Ahnighito, Greenland, meteorite, which Peary brought to New York\r\nCity by ship. (See Chapter 3.) A specially constructed scale on which\r\nthis huge mass is now mounted gives for its weight about 68,000 pounds.\r\nOther meteorites famous for their great size are: the Bacubirito,\r\nMexico, 27 tons; Willamette, Oregon, 14 tons; Morito, Mexico, 11 tons;\r\nand the Bendego, Brazil, 5 tons. All of these are irons.\r\n\r\nThe largest stone meteorite so far recovered as one mass is the\r\nso-called Furnas County, Nebraska, stone, which is the principal\r\nfragment of the Norton, Kansas, fall, and weighs about 2,360 pounds.\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the size-range, investigators have recovered\r\nmeteoritic masses weighing no more than a small fraction of a gram. From\r\na stone shower that occurred at Holbrook, Arizona, field searchers have\r\nfound some of the very smallest specimens in anthills. The insects had\r\ncarried these tiny meteorites along with sand and garnet grains in\r\nbuilding their hills!\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:        COURTESY OF AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY\r\n     The Willamette iron, famous for its great size and weight (14\r\n    tons), on exhibit at the Hayden Planetarium, New York City. See pp.\r\n    36, 39.]\r\n\r\nThe only sure way to determine whether or not an object _is_ a meteorite\r\nis to have a small piece of it (say, a fragment the size of an egg)\r\ntested chemically and microscopically by an expert on meteorites.\r\nNevertheless, there are several questions whose answers will help you to\r\ndecide whether or not you are on the right track in suspecting that a\r\n“rock” you have found may be a meteorite:\r\n\r\n  Is your specimen especially heavy?\r\n\r\n  Does your specimen show a thin blackish or brownish crust on its outer\r\n  surface?\r\n\r\n  Does your “rock” have shallow, oval pits on its outer surface?\r\n\r\n  If the specimen has a corner knocked off, do you see specks and grains\r\n  of metal on the broken surface?\r\n\r\nIs your specimen especially heavy? The iron and stony-iron meteorites\r\nare very heavy. A 1-inch cube of iron meteorite weighs approximately 8\r\ntimes as much as a 1-inch cube of ice. Even the stones, which are only\r\nabout half as dense as the irons, are much heavier than ordinary rocks.\r\n\r\nDoes your specimen show a thin blackish or brownish crust on its outer\r\nsurfaces? You will recall that specimens of both the Ussuri and Norton\r\nmeteorites showed a “glaze” of fused material which we call fusion\r\ncrust. Most freshly-fallen meteorites are covered with such a crust. To\r\nillustrate how this crust forms, consider a snowball that you bravely\r\nhold in your freezing hand until the outer surface melts. If you then\r\nwere to leave the snowball outside overnight, the melted outer surface\r\nwould freeze into a hard crust.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Piezoglyphs (oval pits resembling thumb-prints) in a\r\n    stone meteorite, found at Belly River, Canada. See p. 132.]\r\n\r\nIn similar fashion, the surface of a meteorite melts during the\r\nblazing-hot part of its flight through the air, only to “freeze” into a\r\nhard, firm coating in the lower, cooler portions of its path. This\r\nhardened coating, the fusion crust, is of much importance. Its presence\r\nis one of the best indications that a “rock” is really a meteorite. From\r\nthe character of the fusion crust, experts can piece together a good\r\ndeal about what happened to a meteorite on its way down to earth. If you\r\nshould be lucky enough to find a meteorite, don’t break off the fusion\r\ncrust. A whole encrusted specimen in the hand is worth 200 crustless\r\nfragments scattered at your feet!\r\n\r\nDoes your “rock” have shallow, oval pits or depressions on its outer\r\nsurface? Such features are known technically as _piezoglyphs_ (Greek\r\n_piezein_, to press + _glyph_, to carve) and popularly as\r\n“thumb-prints.” They were formed during the meteorite’s flight through\r\nthe atmosphere when the softer portions of its outer shell were “eroded”\r\naway, leaving small scooped-out places. These pittings are very similar\r\nto the prints that would be made by the human hand in a lump of modeling\r\nclay or bread dough. In one case, they gave rise to the false idea that\r\nthe meteorite had fallen in a plastic state and that the imprints had\r\nbeen formed when its finders first pulled the mass out of the ground by\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nIf the specimen you have found already has a corner knocked off, do you\r\nsee specks and grains of metal on the broken surface? Such scattered\r\nbits of nickel-iron (not to be confused with the shiny mica flakes often\r\nseen in igneous rocks) characteristically occur in the grayish or\r\nbrownish groundmass of stony meteorites. If your specimen is unbroken,\r\nhold it lightly against a spinning carborundum wheel or use a file to\r\ngrind a small flat surface upon it, and then examine this surface for\r\nspecks of metal.\r\n\r\nIf the answers to these questions are yes, then there is a good\r\npossibility that you have found a genuine meteorite.\r\n\r\nIf meteorites remain buried in the ground for a long period of time,\r\ntheir characteristic surface-features may weather away. Under such\r\nconditions, iron meteorites develop heavy-layered coatings of rust (iron\r\noxide) as much as several inches in thickness. If irons stay in the\r\nground long enough, they may rust away almost completely and turn into\r\nshale balls, like those found near the ancient Wolf Creek, Australia\r\nmeteorite crater. (See Chapter 4.) Stone meteorites buried in the ground\r\nfor any great length of time may disintegrate and become completely\r\nunrecognizable as meteorites.\r\n\r\nThe fact that meteorites of all kinds are attacked by weathering has\r\nalways argued strongly in favor of their prompt recovery. In the case of\r\nwitnessed falls, prompt recovery is even more important, for only thus\r\ncan specimens still retaining measurable amounts of various short-lived\r\nradioactivities be made available to physicists eager to investigate\r\nthem with the most modern radiometric equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             10. TEKTITES, IMPACTITES & “FOSSIL” METEORITES\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore southern Australia was occupied by the white man, the native\r\ntribesmen of that region treasured certain small rounded pieces of black\r\nglass as medicine stones, rainmaking stones, and message stones. The\r\nWadikali tribe referred to these objects as _mindjimindjilpara_, a word\r\nmeaning “eyes that look at you like a man staring hard.” The early\r\nEuropean settlers of the area called the same black glassy masses\r\n“blackfellows’ buttons.” Both phrases applied to objects that modern\r\nscientists call “australites,” which are now one of the best known types\r\nof _tektites_ (Greek: _tēktos_, molten).\r\n\r\nThese Australian tektites and the tektites from many other countries\r\naround the world are a problem to meteoriticists. The question is, are\r\nthey really meteorites? Many investigators believe that the answer is\r\nyes, and they are inclined to add to the three main divisions of true\r\nmeteorites listed in the preceding chapter, a fourth: the tektites.\r\n\r\nThese mysterious glassy objects occur in such widely separated\r\nlocalities as Czechoslovakia, the Philippine Islands, Borneo, the Ivory\r\nCoast of Africa, Australia, Indo-China, Texas, Malaya, and Java. In\r\nthese and still other areas, they have been found by the thousands in\r\nsurface deposits of sand, clay, and gravel.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (left) “Flanged buttons” from Australia. (right)\r\n    Several sizes of “dumbbells” from Australia. See p. 136.]\r\n\r\nTektites have never been seen to fall. In spite of this fact, as we\r\nnoted above, a number of scientists believe that, like the meteorites,\r\nthe tektites really did come from outer space but, that they fell to\r\nearth before man was here to see them come down—or at least before he\r\nhad acquired the means and skill to make lasting records of such an\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nTektites are usually quite small, weighing between 1 and 100 grams,\r\nalthough a few of much larger size have been found. One large specimen\r\nfrom the Philippines weighed about ½ pound. Two giant tektites, one\r\nweighing ¾ pound and the other over 1 pound, are in the collection of\r\nthe British Museum. In composition, tektites are an impure silica-glass\r\ncontaining low percentages of the oxides of such elements as iron,\r\nmagnesium, calcium, and titanium.\r\n\r\nIf tektite fragments are held under a lamp and observed by reflected\r\nlight, their thicker parts generally appear to be jet-black. If,\r\nhowever, these same specimens are held up _between_ the observer and the\r\nlight, then their thin razor-sharp edges are seen to be bottle-green,\r\nyellow-green, brownish, or even colorless.\r\n\r\nIn shape, many tektites are roundish or oval. Others are shaped like\r\ndumbbells, ladles, canoes, and teardrops. So they are known by those\r\ndescriptive terms. One particularly interesting example is the unusual\r\n“flanged button” of Australia. Tektites of this type look like miniature\r\nSouth American gold-pans, the _bateas_, heaped high with pay dirt.\r\nAustralian gold-field workers regarded these tektites as magical, and\r\nused them as good-luck charms. Superstitious American gold-seekers\r\nbrought them into the United States all the way from Australia!\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (above) Rounded tektite from Texas. (below) Deeply\r\n    grooved bediasite from Texas.]\r\n\r\nSome tektites (for example, many of the “bediasites” from Texas) are\r\ndeeply grooved and channeled, and have a very jagged and irregular\r\nappearance. Even the smoother tektite surfaces are characterized by flow\r\nlines, flow ridges, and bubble pits.\r\n\r\nMany weathered pebbles and fragments of obsidian somewhat resemble the\r\ntektites superficially. There is a very simple test by which you can\r\ndistinguish true tektites from obsidian. If you hold a thin splinter of\r\ntektite glass in a blowpipe flame, the glass melts quietly but only with\r\nthe greatest difficulty. On the contrary, when you test in the same\r\nflame the terrestrial glass, obsidian, it froths up much more easily,\r\ninto a bubbly, whitish mass.\r\n\r\nAlthough the question of where the tektites came from is still not\r\nentirely settled, most scientists agree that all tektites did have a\r\n_common_ origin. For example, tektites from widely scattered localities\r\non the earth’s surface show not only similar queer shapes and surface\r\nmarkings (technically known as “sculpturing”), but also have very much\r\nthe same chemical composition and, in particular, the same content of\r\nradioactive elements.\r\n\r\nBecause the tektites chemically resemble certain terrestrial rocks,\r\nscientists at first believed that some kind of earth process must have\r\ncreated them. One suggestion was that lightning had fused dust particles\r\nsuspended in the air to form them; another, that they had come from\r\nvolcanoes; still another, that the tektites were simply inclusions that\r\nhad weathered out of terrestrial rocks. A few scientists once took\r\nseriously the possibility that tektites were refuse from primitive glass\r\nfactories!\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Tektite vs. obsidian, after blowpipe test.]\r\n\r\nWhile such theories have not yet been completely discarded, most\r\nscientists now feel that the tektites had their origin somewhere outside\r\nthe earth. There are several reasons for this belief. First, the shape\r\nof such unusually symmetrical forms as are found, for example, among the\r\naustralites, indicates that these small bodies at one time were members\r\nof a swarm of freely-spinning liquid masses. Again, flow features\r\nobserved on the surfaces of certain tektites (and the fusion crust\r\ndefinitely identified on one specimen) show that these bodies at some\r\ntime must have traveled through the earth’s atmosphere at high velocity.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the tektites were not produced by earth processes, where did\r\nthey come from? According to primitive legends, they were “rocks” or\r\n“pebbles” from the moon. Indeed, one of the earliest scientific theories\r\nas to their origin (proposed by the Dutch authority Verbeek in 1897)\r\nlikewise attributes them to debris jetted out from the moon. Another\r\nholds that tektites are fragments of the outermost glassy layers of some\r\nso-called “meteorite-planet,” or planets.[8] Still another idea is that\r\ntektites are what is left of a comet when it passes so close to the\r\nblazing-hot sun that the “ices” which make up most of the cometary\r\nnucleus (head) are all distilled away.\r\n\r\nThese theories of the origin of the tektites are based primarily on\r\ntheir observed shapes, surface features, and compositions. The senior\r\nauthor of this book has suggested still another possible theory based on\r\nthe very unusual nature of the observed distribution of the tektites on\r\nthe face of the earth.\r\n\r\nTo explain this theory, we first recall that the planet on which we live\r\nis more nearly a true sphere than are such familiar “spherical” objects\r\nas baseballs or basketballs. Consequently, any plane through the center\r\nof the earth cuts its surface in a curve that to all intents and\r\npurposes is what geometers refer to as a _great circle_.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Every plane passing through the center of a sphere\r\n    intersects the surface in a great circle. In this figure, only the\r\n    front half of the great circle cut out by the plane is shown.]\r\n\r\nNow the significant fact is that all the tektite deposits known at\r\npresent are located on or very near to three great circles on the\r\nearth’s surface. Mathematics shows that if some earth process had\r\ncreated the tektites at random over the surface of the earth, then the\r\nodds would be very strongly against the existence of this peculiar\r\n“great-circle distribution.” But such distribution along great circles\r\nwould be _expected_ if the tektites had resulted from what might be\r\nlikened to “chain-falls” upon the earth of objects like nearby\r\nsatellites moving in orbits encircling our globe.\r\n\r\nThis notion brings up the interesting possibility that at some time in\r\nthe remote past, the earth may have been the proud possessor of a set of\r\nequatorial rings. These rings would have been similar to those at\r\npresent circling in the plane of Saturn’s equator. (Jupiter, too, may\r\nonce have had its own set of equatorial rings.) The rings of Saturn are\r\nknown to be made up of countless very small meteorites. In the same way,\r\nthe “earth rings” of prehistory could have consisted of swarms of tiny\r\nnearby meteoritic satellites—the tektites—moving about the earth in the\r\nplane of its then-existing equator.\r\n\r\nEventually, the innermost of these small natural satellites collapsed\r\nonto the earth’s surface, falling along the old equator. At least twice\r\nthereafter, this process was repeated, the points of impact of the later\r\ntektite falls again lining up along whatever great circle of the earth\r\nhappened to be the equator at the time of fall.\r\n\r\nAs the geologists and other investigators have shown, major shifts have\r\noccurred in the position of the earth’s equator during past geologic\r\nages. This fact is well-substantiated by discoveries of fossil shells\r\nand plants on the cold Antarctic continent and of glacial deposits in\r\nhot South Africa. Therefore, we could hardly expect the tektite\r\ndeposits, which are believed to have fallen at widely separated\r\nintervals of time, to have all occurred along a _single_ great circle on\r\nthe earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the so-called “tektite-puzzle” is a complex one. As if\r\nthis were not bad enough, Mother Nature has added to the confusion by\r\ncreating in addition to the tektites another type of silica-glass not\r\nonly found along the very same three great circles sprinkled with true\r\ntektites, but also having other features in common with the tektite\r\nglasses.\r\n\r\nAt Mount Darwin in Tasmania and at Wabar in the Rub’ al Khali desert of\r\nArabia, large and small fragments of this curious silica-glass have been\r\ncollected. At Wabar the masses of silica-glass were found in and about\r\nthe rims of a series of meteorite craters formed in nearly pure sand, as\r\nwe pointed out in Chapter 4. These meteorite craters are known to have\r\nresulted from the high-speed impact of iron meteorites upon the sand\r\ndunes of the Wabar site. Since the silica-glasses of Wabar have been\r\nfound to contain countless spherules of nickel-iron of the same\r\ncomposition as the iron meteorites discovered about the Wabar meteorite\r\ncraters, it seems quite certain that both the sand of the earth target\r\nand the nickel-iron of the falling meteorites were vaporized by the\r\nintense heat generated at impact. Consequently, it is natural that these\r\nWabar masses of congealed silica-glass and nickel-iron be called\r\n_impactites_. They are silica-glasses, created chiefly from\r\n_terrestrial_ materials by the impact of large crater-forming\r\nmeteorites. This same name is now applied to all silica-glasses believed\r\nto have the same origin as those at Wabar.\r\n\r\nAs regards size if not composition, the crater-forming meteorites\r\nresponsible for the Wabar and other impactites may have been big\r\nbrothers of the small-fry responsible for the showers of true tektites.\r\nOr these big ones may have moved about the earth in orbits distinct from\r\nthose followed by the tektite swarms but lying in the same plane as one\r\nof these swarms.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the curious puzzle of the tektites, meteoriticists have\r\nalso run up against the problem of “fossil” meteorites or, more exactly,\r\nthe problem of the _lack_ of “fossil” meteorites. As we have already\r\nmentioned, no positively identified meteorite has ever been found in\r\nother than the most recent rock layers. With all the mining—particularly\r\ncoal mining—that has gone on throughout the world in historic times,\r\nthis fact does seem astonishing.\r\n\r\nA number of explanations can be suggested for this absence of ancient\r\nmeteorites. In the geologic past, meteorite falls may not have occurred\r\nas often as they do today. For example, the primeval atmosphere of the\r\nearth may have been so much denser than at present that even quite large\r\nmeteorites were totally vaporized as they passed through it and\r\ntherefore never reached the ground. Again, even if the rate of infall of\r\nmeteorites was the same in the remote past as now, still various\r\nweathering processes active ever since the earliest meteorites fell may\r\nhave so changed them in appearance and composition that they are no\r\nlonger recognizable for what they are.\r\n\r\nSeveral unusual lumps of rock from England and a mass of iron from\r\nAustria, all found at some depth by coal miners, have been tentatively\r\nput forward as “fossil” meteorites. But studies of these masses have so\r\nfar produced no conclusive results. Still, we should not ignore the\r\npossibility that someday meteorites may be found and identified in rocks\r\nof considerable age.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:                                   L. J.

In speaking\r\nbriefly about the tektites, the impactites, and the absence of “fossil”\r\nmeteorites, we have by no means tried to present the last word on the\r\ntroublesome but highly interesting problems connected with these\r\nobjects—problems that admittedly may take scientists years or even\r\ndecades of further research to solve. Perhaps you will find here the\r\nkind of unusual and thought-provoking problems that make the study of\r\nmeteorites a rather special challenge. If so, you may wish to take an\r\nactive part someday in unraveling these puzzles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        11. OMENS AND FANTASIES\r\n\r\n\r\nMen seem to have always taken an interest in meteorites, but not until\r\nthe early nineteenth century were these objects considered to be worth\r\npreserving for _scientific_ study.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, people believed that because meteorites fell from the\r\nheavens, they were either gods themselves or messengers from the gods.\r\nThe more civilized of early men therefore carefully kept the fallen\r\nmeteorites. They draped them in costly linens and anointed them with\r\noil. In many instances, the people built special temples in which\r\nmeteorites were actually worshipped. Some of the holy stones of the\r\nancients, such as the Diana of the Ephesians, mentioned in the Bible as\r\n“the image which fell down from Jupiter,”[9] are now thought to have\r\nbeen meteorites.\r\n\r\nMeteorite worship was common long ago in the Mediterranean area and in\r\nAfrica, India, Japan, and Mexico. This practice still persists in some\r\nregions even in modern times. The Black Stone of the Kaaba, for example,\r\nhas been sacred to all Mohammedans from about 700 A.D. right up to the\r\npresent. It is said to be a meteorite although this fact has never been\r\nverified, because strict religious taboos connected with the stone\r\nprevent any scientific examination or study of it. On the contrary, the\r\nAndhâra, India, meteorite is known to be a genuine one. The story of the\r\nfall and preservation of this meteorite provides a fairly modern example\r\nof practices rooted in the ritual and custom of far more ancient times.\r\n\r\nAt about 4:00 in the afternoon of December 2, 1880, the people of\r\nAndhâra heard a noise like that made by a gun. Some of the villagers saw\r\na “dark ball” come to earth in a field near them. This falling object\r\nsent up a small cloud of dust as it struck the ground. After the stone\r\nhad been recovered from the field and the dust had been washed from its\r\nsurface, two Brahmin priests took charge of it and began to collect\r\nmoney for the erection of a temple in which the holy object could be\r\nproperly displayed.\r\n\r\nThe scientist who promptly investigated the Andhâra fall reported that\r\nthrongs of worshippers were crowding into the as yet unfinished brick\r\ntemple to make offerings of flowers, sweetmeats, milk, rice, water, bel\r\nleaves, and of course money. The stone had been named Adbhuta-Nâth, “the\r\nmiraculous god.” It was shaped like a round loaf of blackish bread and\r\nweighed an estimated 6 pounds. The scientist was not allowed to touch\r\nit, but he got close enough to verify that the stone was a meteorite\r\ncovered with a typical blackish fusion crust.\r\n\r\nNot only has man worshipped meteorites, but during a period extending\r\nfrom approximately 300 B.C. to 300 A.D., emperors and self-governing\r\ncities frequently marked the fall of meteorites by minting special coins\r\nor medals known as _betyls_.[10] One of these is the betyl of Emisa,\r\nSyria, made by Antonius Pius (138-161 A.D.). The historian, Herodotus,\r\naccurately described the object honored by this betyl as: “A large\r\nstone, which on the lower side is round, and above runs gradually to a\r\npoint. It has nearly the form of a cone, and is of a black color.\r\n_People say of it in earnest that it fell from Heaven._” The stone is\r\nshown on the coin as carried on a quadriga (a carriage drawn by four\r\nhorses) under a canopy of four sunshades.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:        COURTESY OF AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY\r\n     Drawing of multiple fireball, over Athens, October 18, 1863. J. F.\r\n    J. Schmidt, the celebrated pioneer fireball observer, described it\r\n    as a mass of dazzling light “bringing into view land and sea, with\r\n    the Acropolis and the Parthenon a mile away across the city.”]\r\n\r\nMany ancient peoples held meteorites in great reverence, particularly if\r\nthey were seen to fall. But at the same time, other more\r\npractical-minded individuals made good use of the durable and easily\r\nworked alloy provided by nature in the nickel-iron meteorites. This\r\nalloy was frequently used to make ax-heads, spear and harpoon points,\r\nknives, farming tools, stirrups and spurs, and even pots and other\r\nutensils. Archeologists have found earrings and similar ornaments\r\noverlaid with thin sheets of hammered meteoritic iron in Indian mounds\r\nof the Ohio Valley. They have also discovered round beads made of\r\nnickel-iron in Indian mounds of the Havana, Illinois, area and in the\r\nstill more ancient Egyptian ruins at Gerzah.\r\n\r\nMeteoritic iron has often been used in the manufacture of special\r\nswords, daggers, and knives for members of the royalty. Atilla and other\r\nearly conquerors of Europe boasted of “swords from heaven.” Emperor\r\nJehangir (1605-1627) ordered two sword blades, a knife, and a dagger to\r\nbe smelted from the Jalandhar, India, meteorite, which fell on April 10,\r\n1621. In the early nineteenth century, a sword was manufactured from a\r\nportion of the Cape of Good Hope meteorite for presentation to\r\nAlexander, the Emperor of Russia. Even as late as the end of the\r\nnineteenth century, several swords were made from a part of the\r\nShirihagi, Japan, iron meteorite at the command of a member of the\r\nJapanese court.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A Russian artist’s pen-and-ink drawing of an\r\n    extremely brilliant detonating fire ball or bolide. See page 102.]\r\n\r\nIn the Europe of the Middle Ages, meteorite falls and meteor showers, as\r\nwell as other “unnatural” events like comets, eclipses, and displays of\r\nthe aurora borealis, were regarded with superstitious awe by commoner\r\nand king alike. The medieval mind always sought to interpret events\r\nconnected in any way with the heavens as somehow influencing the affairs\r\nof men. A bishop explained that the great meteor shower of April 4,\r\n1095, forecast “the changes and wanderings of nations from kingdom to\r\nkingdom.” The fact, however, that the First Crusade began within a year,\r\nis mere coincidence.\r\n\r\nIn referring to celestial events, Shakespeare often expressed the view\r\nthat was common in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. An example is:\r\n\r\n  The bay-trees in our country are all wither’d\r\n  And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven;\r\n  The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth\r\n  And lean-look’d prophets whisper fearful change,\r\n  . . . . . .\r\n  These signs forerun the death or fall of kings.\r\n                                        (_Richard II_, II, iv, 8-11, 15)\r\n\r\nYet the descent of meteorites from the heavens was not always regarded\r\nas a forewarning of bad fortune. On November 16, 1492, a 279-pound\r\nmeteorite fell at Ensisheim in Alsace, not far from the battle line\r\nseparating the armies of France and the Holy Roman Empire. Emperor\r\nMaximilian, the leader of the Empire’s forces, commanded that the fallen\r\nstone be carried to his castle. There a formal war-council was held to\r\ndetermine what the strange event could mean.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:        COURTESY OF AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY\r\n     Drawing of Andromedid meteor shower, November 27, 1872.]\r\n\r\nThe Emperor and his councillors decided that the fall of the meteorite\r\nat such a time and place was an omen of divine favor which meant good\r\nfortune to the cause of the Holy Roman Empire. After breaking off two\r\nsmall pieces of the stone, one for the Duke of Austria and one for\r\nhimself, the Emperor forbade further damage to it. He also gave orders\r\nthat the stone be hung in the parish church in Ensisheim for all to see.\r\nIn this way, the Ensisheim stone became the very first meteorite of\r\nwitnessed fall to be preserved down to the present day—and all because\r\nof the superstition of a famous military leader.\r\n\r\nThe discussion to this point makes clear that in ancient, medieval, and\r\nRenaissance times, meteorite falls were considered as startling and\r\ndisturbing events, which frequently were interpreted in strange and\r\nmistaken ways. But the fact that meteorites actually did fall from the\r\nheavens was not questioned. As the so-called “Age of Reason” opened, a\r\ncurious change in attitude toward meteorite falls took place.\r\n\r\nAt the very time that knowledge in general increased, men of learning\r\nbegan to deny that meteorite falls occurred at all! The scientists of\r\nthe French Academy, in particular, were very positive on this point.\r\nSince the era was one in which all Europe sneezed if “la belle France”\r\nhad a cold in the head, it was a trying time not only for the early\r\nmeteoriticists, but for all who had the nerve to insist they had seen\r\nrocks fall from the sky.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the 1700’s, the authorities had studied the evidence\r\nrelating to meteorite falls and had completely rejected it. They said\r\nthat there was no “proof” whatever that “stones fell from the heavens.”\r\nThese early scientists openly sneered at people who claimed that they\r\nhad seen meteorites fall. It was felt that the spectators of such events\r\neither had merely been “seeing things,” or had surely been reporting\r\nlight and sound effects connected with nothing but ordinary\r\nthunderstorms.\r\n\r\nWhen confronted with the “fallen” masses themselves, the authorities\r\noften refused to examine them, or if they did, insisted that these\r\nmasses were only rocks that had been struck by lightning. Such were the\r\nopinions of learned men around the close of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nFortunately, scientific facts have a stubborn way of winning out in the\r\nlong run. A major part of the credit for seeing that the truth regarding\r\nmeteorite falls was at last recognized must go to E. F. F. Chladni, a\r\nGerman physicist, and to Edward Howard, an English chemist.\r\n\r\nIn 1794, Chladni published an extremely important paper concerning a\r\nlarge spongelike mass of “native iron” found near Krasnoyarsk, Russia.\r\nThis object had been discovered in 1749 by a Russian blacksmith, and it\r\nwas studied in 1772 by P. S. Pallas, an early traveler. Chladni\r\nconcluded that the mass of iron[11] must have fallen from the heavens,\r\nbecause it had been “fused” (but not by man, electricity, or fire) and\r\nalso because there were no volcanoes anywhere around its place of find.\r\n\r\nChladni supported his theory by listing numerous reports of meteorite\r\nfalls dating from ancient and medieval times. But Chladni’s fellow\r\nscientists flatly rejected his theory as clever but not satisfactory.\r\n\r\nWith the fall of the Siena meteorites in Italy on June 16, 1794, the\r\ncontroversy regarding the possibility that stones actually fell from the\r\nsky became particularly heated, and remained so for nearly ten years.\r\nDuring this interval, two other important meteorite falls occurred: Wold\r\nCottage, England, on December 13, 1795, and Benares, India, on December\r\n19, 1798. Scientists had a hard time finding explanations for these\r\nwell-observed events, and some of the theories put forward to account\r\nfor them far outdid Chladni’s in “cleverness,” if that be the correct\r\nword.\r\n\r\nOne scholar, writing in 1796, suggested that the masses which fell at\r\nSiena resulted from the solidification at great height of volcanic ashes\r\nfrom Mount Vesuvius. These ashes had supposedly been carried northward\r\nbeyond Siena and then been “brought back by a northerly wind, congealing\r\nfrom the air....”\r\n\r\nFortunately, in 1803 Edward Howard’s chemical work on meteorites came to\r\na successful conclusion. This patient chemist made analyses of samples\r\nfrom the Siena, Wold Cottage, and Benares falls and from an older\r\nBohemian fall. He also had the samples studied mineralogically by a\r\nfellow scientist. From the results of these investigations, he drew the\r\nfollowing conclusions, which admirably supported Chladni’s well-reasoned\r\nand thoroughly documented theory regarding meteorite falls:\r\n\r\n  All four of the stones studied had very nearly the same composition.\r\n\r\n  Despite the fact that the stones contained no new elements, their\r\n  mineralogical character differed in several important respects from\r\n  that of any rocks found naturally on the earth.\r\n\r\n  The four masses must have had a common origin although their reported\r\n  falls had been widely separated both in time and in space.\r\n\r\n  Finally, said Howard, it was quite possible that the stones had really\r\n  fallen from the sky.\r\n\r\nHoward’s views were soon put to the test. Shortly after the publication\r\nof his important paper, a shower of stony meteorites fell near L’Aigle,\r\nFrance, on April 26, 1803. This event was carefully investigated by\r\nFrench scientists, and they reluctantly admitted that about 3,000 stones\r\nactually had fallen within an oval-shaped area about 6 miles long by 2\r\nmiles wide. This shower of meteorites had been accompanied by the same\r\nlight and sound effects mentioned in many of the old meteorite-fall\r\nreports collected by Chladni, effects now recognized as characteristic\r\nof the infall of meteorites upon the earth. The evidence was\r\noverwhelming—stones really did fall from the sky. In the camp of the\r\nenemy, so to speak, the reality of meteorite falls was established once\r\nand for all!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          12. THE MODERN VIEW\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the L’Aigle shower of 1803, a whole new era opened in the study of\r\nmeteorites. No longer did scientists hold these objects up to ridicule\r\nand scorn. Instead, they came to regard meteorites as well worth\r\ncollection and careful study.\r\n\r\nThe Vienna Museum, the British Museum, the Paris Museum, the Academy of\r\nScience of St. Petersburg (now Leningrad), and the U.S. National Museum\r\nbegan to build up splendid meteorite collections. Scientists in Germany,\r\nEngland, France, and Russia engaged in the painstaking mineralogical\r\nstudy and classification of individual meteorite specimens.\r\n\r\nThe modern science of meteoritics is rooted deep in the nineteenth\r\ncentury. Many special fields of investigation had their beginnings then.\r\nScientists became interested in the chemistry, the mineralogy, and the\r\nmetallurgy of meteorites; in the orbits of meteorites and the\r\ntrajectories they follow through the earth’s atmosphere down to impact\r\nwith the ground; and in the distribution of meteorite falls in space and\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nFrom this period we can date such milestones of progress in meteoritics\r\nas:\r\n\r\n  The discovery of the beautiful and significant Widmanstätten patterns\r\n  characteristic of the majority of the irons, and the less spectacular\r\n  but equally important lines named for J. G. Neumann, the German\r\n  meteoriticist who discovered them, in 1848, in the Braunau meteorite.\r\n\r\n  The realization that there were many different kinds of meteorites and\r\n  that these diverse objects were very important to an understanding of\r\n  the internal structure and origin of the earth, and perhaps of the\r\n  Solar System and the wider cosmos as well.\r\n\r\n  Tentative explanations of the violent and terrifying light and sound\r\n  effects connected with meteorite falls.\r\n\r\n  Tentative explanations of such oval-shaped areas as shown above.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Typical distribution of meteorite fragments according\r\n    to size, within oval-shaped area of fall. The larger masses of the\r\n    shower carry farther on, in the direction of the motion of the\r\n    meteorite. As early as 1814, investigators had noted this\r\n    peculiarity of meteorite-shower distributions. See pp. 32, 89, 94.]\r\n\r\nBy 1850, A. Boisse, an early French geologist and meteoriticist, had put\r\nforth the basic _meteorite-planet_ hypothesis. According to this theory\r\nof his, meteorites are the fragments of a planet[12] that formerly\r\norbited between Mars and Jupiter in what is now called the “asteroid\r\nbelt.” And untold millions of years ago, this planet was shattered by\r\nsome unknown but very great force, possibly collision with another\r\ncelestial body.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the meteorite-planet was considered to have been very\r\nmuch like that of the earth. The various divisions of recognized\r\nmeteorites were believed to be representatives of the several\r\nconcentric, or nested, shells of material originally making up the\r\ndestroyed planet. These shells were progressively less dense with\r\nincreasing distance from the center of the planet.\r\n\r\nToday Boisse’s theory is one of the most widely accepted as an\r\nexplanation of at least one major category of the meteorites. Some\r\nmodern investigators would insist that the meteorite-planet had a thin\r\nouter glassy shell from which the tektites came.\r\n\r\nMost of the larger fragments of the meteorite-planet, now called the\r\n_asteroids_, move so that the average asteroidal orbit very closely\r\napproximates the orbit of the original planet. But many of the smaller\r\nfragments follow paths in space that differ considerably from the\r\noriginal meteorite-planet’s orbit. Even some of the asteroids behave\r\nthis way, either because of the high speeds they acquired at the time of\r\ndisruption of the meteorite-planet, or because of the later influence of\r\nthe major planets and particularly of the giant planet, Jupiter.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A diagram (not drawn to scale) showing position of\r\n    asteroid-belt with respect to the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The\r\n    asteroids with average orbits move within this belt. The non-typical\r\n    asteroid indicated follows an orbit that brings it well inside that\r\n    of the earth. There are a number of asteroids with such peculiar\r\n    orbits. It is possible that in the past a nickel-iron asteroid in\r\n    one of these orbits collided with the earth and produced the Canyon\r\n    Diablo meteorite crater.]\r\n\r\nIn fact, at the present time, several asteroids move well within the\r\norbits of the earth and Venus. It is quite possible therefore that such\r\na large meteorite crater as the one at Canyon Diablo, was produced by\r\nthe prehistoric fall of one of these small members of our Solar System.\r\nIf so, we have reason to believe that a core-fragment of the\r\nmeteorite-planet came to earth at Canyon Diablo. For the extensive\r\nmining operations carried out there during the last half-century have\r\nshown that the projectile responsible for this greatest of all\r\nmeteoritic shell-holes in the face of Mother Earth was a mass of solid\r\nnickel-iron, which in all likelihood was core material.\r\n\r\nThe lengthy and costly series of mining operations at Canyon Diablo were\r\nall undertaken in the hope of locating the “main mass” of this huge\r\nprojectile and thus of opening up what might be called a cosmic-lode of\r\nquite valuable metals. Unfortunately, the miners overlooked the fact\r\nthat impacts at meteoritic speeds produced almost incredible amounts of\r\nheat. Even the solid iron meteorites are vaporized and widely dispersed\r\nat the temperatures resulting from such impacts, as we have seen was the\r\ncase at Wabar (see Chapter 4). So it was at Canyon Diablo.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a cosmic-metal mine might at first strike some readers as\r\ntoo futuristic to take seriously. But the necessity for catching a\r\ncore-fragment before it enters the consuming atmosphere of our planet is\r\nreally nothing new. As far back as 1939, the senior author had occasion\r\nto point out that if we wish to start a successful cosmic-metal mine, we\r\nmust catch our core-fragment before it is turned into unminable vapor.\r\nThis point will come up again in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Cross-section of Boisse’s hypothetical\r\n    meteorite-planet. Fragmentation of this sphere was believed to have\r\n    given rise to the following divisions of meteorites:\r\n\r\n    The _iron_ meteorites came from A, the dense nickel-iron core.\r\n\r\n    The stony-iron meteorites came from B, the intermediate zone of\r\n    cellular nickel-iron and silicate minerals.\r\n\r\n    The _stony_ meteorites came from C, the outer zone of silicate\r\n    minerals in which relatively little or no nickel-iron is present.\r\n    The chondrites were believed to come from the inner portion of this\r\n    zone; the achondrites, from the outer portion.]\r\n\r\nThere are several other theories of the origin of meteorites interesting\r\nenough to mention. The early view that the meteorites were debris thrown\r\nout by ancient volcanoes on the moon or recent ones on the earth came to\r\nbe discredited largely on physical grounds. On the other hand, extremely\r\nviolent _primordial_ volcanoes on the earth (not the weak ones of\r\nhistoric times, like Aetna or Vesuvius) could have ejected material that\r\nin much later times fell, and continues to fall back on our globe. This\r\ntheory has not been ruled out and it still receives support, for\r\nexample, from some authorities in the U.S.S.R. These same Russian\r\nscientists take most seriously a suggestion that the meteorites (and\r\ncomets as well) were thrown out by volcanoes believed to exist on the\r\nplanet, Jupiter—a theory dating back almost a century to the English\r\nastronomer, R. A. Proctor.\r\n\r\nSome scientists believe that meteorites represent the congealed remains\r\nof gaseous bolts of matter ejected by the sun. Others interpret them as\r\nfragments of comets that have been torn apart by passing too close to\r\nthe sun, which is the most powerful gravitational center in the Solar\r\nSystem.\r\n\r\nChemists, geologists, astronomers, and physicists—as well as the\r\nmeteoriticists themselves—are constantly working toward a solution of\r\nthe problem of the meteorites. Where do these bodies come from? What can\r\nwe learn from them about their age and origin and about the age and\r\norigin of our Solar System? Years may be required, but eventually the\r\nriddle of the meteorites will be solved by the patient, concerted\r\nefforts of men and women of science.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Collapsed mine buildings in the bottom of the Canyon\r\n    Diablo meteorite crater. A shaft was put down here in one of several\r\n    unsuccessful attempts to locate the main mass of the meteorite. See\r\n    pp. 44-52.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  13. PRESENT AND FUTURE APPLICATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far we have considered what might be called the “pure” rather than\r\nthe “applied” side of the study of meteorites. The investigator in any\r\npure science asks of a new discovery, “What does this tell me about the\r\nuniverse? How does it better help me to understand the laws of nature?”\r\nOf the same discovery, however, the worker in an applied science will\r\nask, “What practical use can be made of this gain in knowledge? What can\r\nit be made to do for mankind in general?”\r\n\r\nThese questions reveal a decided difference in viewpoint, but this\r\ndifference does not reflect unfavorably on either class of scientists.\r\nIn fact, there is a great deal of truth in the saying “Today’s pure\r\nscience is tomorrow’s applied.” Actually, ways and means of taking\r\nadvantage of seemingly useless scientific discoveries are constantly\r\nbeing found. The most famous example of this principle is the\r\ndevelopment of the atomic bomb from the results of Einstein’s researches\r\nin the abstract field of relativity. Here the seemingly mystic formula E\r\n= mc² came to have far-reaching practical applications indeed!\r\n\r\nMeteoritics has some exceedingly practical applications. Far from being\r\ncompletely “out of this world”—as the recovered meteorites themselves\r\noriginally were—this science has been and can be made to serve mankind\r\nin a number of rather unexpected ways. Meteoritics, the onetime\r\n“stepchild of astronomy,” is currently being regarded with\r\never-increasing respect by scientists and engineers working in many\r\ndifferent fields.\r\n\r\nConsider, first of all, the stainless steels that are so widely used in\r\nmodern industry, and even the fine satin-sheen stainless “silverware”\r\nthat graces our dining tables. These have wisely been patterned after a\r\nnatural alloy with lasting qualities of strength, tenacity, and\r\nresistance to corrosion. This natural alloy is the one making up the\r\niron meteorites.\r\n\r\nIts toughness and durability became well known wherever attempts were\r\nmade to section these metallic meteorites. Specially designed and\r\nextra-powerful sawing equipment is required to slice meteoritic iron,\r\nand even with it, progress is painfully slow. So astounded were those\r\nwho first tried to cut iron meteorites with ordinary metal saws that one\r\nof the earliest practical results was the development of battleship\r\narmor plate composed of a commercial alloy called “meteor steel,” which\r\nmimicked the composition of the iron meteorites.\r\n\r\nOf course, a good deal of the difficulty of sectioning meteorites arises\r\nfrom the fact that those doing the cutting are trying hard not to waste\r\nvaluable meteoritic material. Every precaution is taken to keep the\r\namount of “sawdust” to a minimum, for such finely ground up and\r\ncontaminated meteoritic material is of little scientific use. And, in\r\naddition, scientists must guard against heating meteorites to high\r\ntemperatures because such heating destroys the delicate internal\r\nstructure of the masses. If these two considerations (loss of material\r\nand overheating) were unimportant, even a large meteorite could easily\r\nbe divided up by use of such high-powered oxyacetylene torches as are\r\nused to dissect huge obsolete battleships.\r\n\r\nAt the Institute of Meteoritics, a thin, water-cooled blade of soft iron\r\nis driven slowly back and forth by an electric motor. Carborundum grit\r\nin water suspension is fed evenly into the narrow cut over its entire\r\nlength. This grit becomes imbedded in the lower edge of the soft iron\r\nblade, which then acts as a “many-toothed” metal saw. Several meteorites\r\ncan be sectioned simultaneously by this multiblade saw. In the future,\r\nsuch newly developed methods as high-speed particle jet streams or\r\nultrasonic devices may be used to section meteorites both rapidly and\r\neconomically.\r\n\r\nIn the field of cosmic ray studies, particularly those concerned with\r\nthe protection of space travelers from harmful radiation, meteoritics\r\ncan be of help. The recovered meteorites have already come through those\r\nregions that would be crossed by even the farthest-ranging spaceships.\r\nConsequently, a great deal can be learned from the study of meteorites\r\nabout the intensity of the cosmic radiation that the crews of such ships\r\nmust face once they get outside the earth’s protective air-shield.\r\n\r\nThe first study of this type was made in May, 1948, at the Institute for\r\nNuclear Studies of the University of Chicago (now the Enrico Fermi\r\nInstitute). Scientists made radioactivity tests on samples of the Norton\r\nCounty meteorite donated for this purpose by the Institute of\r\nMeteoritics and air-expressed to Chicago because of the intense interest\r\nin the radioactivity question. In October, 1949, English investigators\r\nran similar tests at the Londonderry Laboratory for Radiochemistry,\r\nDurham, England, on samples of the freshly fallen Beddgelert, North\r\nWales, meteorite discussed on pp. 69-70. The results of these two\r\npioneer studies were negative because the “Model-T” instruments\r\navailable in 1948 and 1949 were not sensitive enough to detect the\r\nrelatively low radioactivities present.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The 6-blade meteorite gang-saw in the machine shop at\r\n    the Institute of Meteoritics.]\r\n\r\nIn 1955, however, scientists at Purdue University, using more refined\r\ncounters, studied small nuggets of nickel-iron, also from the Norton\r\nmeteorite. This time, the results of the radioactivity tests were\r\npositive. The investigators detected tritium (an isotope of hydrogen\r\nproduced by cosmic-ray bombardment) in the samples. Furthermore, the\r\n_amount_ of this rare isotope present indicated that the intensity of\r\ncosmic radiation outside the earth’s atmosphere may be very much higher\r\nthan had previously been thought possible. “Forewarned is forearmed,”\r\nand from the standpoint of future astronauts, this is as practical a\r\nresult as one could wish for!\r\n\r\nIn the relatively near future, men will certainly land on the surface of\r\nthe moon. We know from radiometric studies that some degree of\r\nradioactivity is induced in meteorites by the full-intensity cosmic\r\nradiation to which they have been exposed during their motion through\r\nspace. The nearly airless moon, like the meteorites, has also been\r\nexposed to very intense cosmic radiation for a long time. So those who\r\nare planning to land on our satellite are concerned about the\r\nradioactivities they will encounter when they begin their explorations\r\nof the lunar surface.\r\n\r\nSuppose that extra-sensitive instruments were designed to pick up and\r\nmeasure the radioactivities. Suppose further that these instruments were\r\nmounted in a space-probe put in an orbit circling closely about the\r\nmoon. Plans for such a project are now under way. What types and\r\nintensities of lunar radioactivities might such probe-mounted\r\ninstruments record?\r\n\r\nUntil such a space-probe becomes available, earth-bound space-scientists\r\nare seeking at least a preliminary answer to this question. They are\r\ndoing this by investigating the natural “probes” that have come to us\r\nfrom space—the meteorites.\r\n\r\nInvestigators have undertaken such studies very recently by employing a\r\nnew radiometric method technically called _gamma-ray spectroscopy_. Work\r\nof this sort has been and is being done at the Los Alamos, New Mexico,\r\nScientific Laboratory on scores of meteorite and tektite specimens\r\nloaned to the Laboratory by the Institute of Meteoritics. Some of the\r\nindividual meteorite specimens tested weighed as much as 37 pounds, and\r\nare probably the largest single extra-terrestrial masses yet tested for\r\ncosmic ray-induced radioactivities.\r\n\r\nLet us turn now to another important application of meteoritics. Any\r\nbody in motion through the air or in space has a “striking power” of\r\nsorts. For some objects, this striking power, which is technically known\r\nas _ballistic potential_, is very weak, as in the case of silky\r\nmilkweed-down drifting through the air. Hailstones have a good deal more\r\nstriking power, as may have been painfully demonstrated on your own\r\nhead. And, finally, such masses as falling meteorites (and especially\r\nthose orbiting in space, unretarded by atmospheric resistance) have an\r\nextraordinarily formidable ballistic potential. This is because\r\nmeteorites are not only tough and dense, as good projectiles must be,\r\nbut are also moving at high velocities—particularly high if the\r\nmeteorites come into the Solar System from interstellar space.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, the speeds of meteorites are very important to\r\nscientists responsible for rocket flights and for keeping satellites\r\naloft over long periods of time. Clearly, these men must have as\r\naccurate information as possible on where and how fast meteoritic\r\nparticles are moving, so as to chart the safest routes for spaceships,\r\nand to develop satisfactory means of protecting rockets and satellites\r\nagainst the effects of bombardment by the smaller meteorites. For these\r\n“small-fry” cosmic missiles are so numerous that many of them are sure\r\nto be encountered even in brief flights outside the earth’s atmosphere.\r\n\r\nSuch information might also prove valuable in the future to the crews of\r\nspaceships on long flights into deep space. Such men may face the life\r\nor death problem of taking successful “evasive action” against giant\r\nmeteorites that will seem like flying hills and mountains.\r\n\r\nA strong parallelism exists between a meteorite fall and the re-entry of\r\na nose-cone or data-capsule into the atmosphere. To a considerable\r\nextent, the difficult problems connected with the latter are being\r\nattacked at present through careful studies of meteorites. From the\r\nair-sculptured shapes of meteorites, their crustal flow patterns, and\r\nthe thicknesses and types of fusion crusts they show, scientists are\r\nlearning a great deal about certain factors connected with the re-entry\r\nproblem. These factors include rate of vaporization, effects of extreme\r\ntemperatures, and types of sculpturing to be expected as a result of\r\nencountering the resisting molecules of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Relationship between (A) the trajectory of a falling\r\n    meteorite, and (B) the re-entry stage of a V-2 rocket. The solid\r\n    lines indicate the similar portions of the two trajectories.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A. A METEORITE FALL\r\n  B. A V-2 RE-ENTRY]\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most obvious applications of meteoritics in the future will\r\ngrow out of the well-known fact that our earthly resources of many\r\nstrategic materials—especially metals like iron and nickel—are fast\r\nbecoming exhausted. The population of the earth is increasing at a mad\r\npace, and an end to metal-consuming wars is still not in sight. The need\r\nfor such metals can only become more and more acute.\r\n\r\nAccording to one of the currently favored explanations of the origin of\r\nthe meteorites, the core-fragments of the parent meteorite-planet are\r\nsolid masses of nickel-iron alloy—like the mass that blasted out the\r\nCanyon Diablo meteorite crater. If this meteorite-planet hypothesis\r\nfinally wins general acceptance, the meteoriticist of the future is\r\nalmost sure to be set the task of pin-pointing as exactly as possible\r\nthe whereabouts in space and time of the most easily accessible cosmic\r\nnickel-iron lodes of this sort. Once he has given an answer, the space\r\nengineers will take over, and mining operations will be started on the\r\nunlimited sources of essential metals to be found in outer space.\r\n\r\nInitially, no doubt, metal recoveries will be freighted back to earth in\r\nrocket-load lots. But as the need for iron and nickel increases on a\r\nmetal-hungry earth, vast engineering projects may well be undertaken to\r\n“snare” the larger metal meteorites and equip them with rocket motors.\r\nThis will be done so that by use of rocket power, the natural orbits of\r\nthe meteorites can be changed into orbits bringing them back to earth.\r\nUnlike the natural, uncontrolled Canyon Diablo meteorite fall that\r\nvaporized what would have been a rich nickel-iron deposit, the\r\nrocket-controlled meteoritic “metal mines” will be eased down to earth\r\nall in one piece.\r\n\r\nReading of the possibility of sending out expeditions to find large iron\r\nmeteorites in the depths of space may bring to your mind an image of the\r\nfearless mariners of old who sailed their stout ships over dangerous,\r\noften uncharted seas in search of the great whales. The rocket crews of\r\nday-after-tomorrow will no doubt be equally fearless and resourceful as\r\nthey navigate the sea of space, intent on capturing the great “metal\r\nmines” of the future.\r\n\r\nThe experience gained in such space-mining ventures will then be carried\r\nover into expeditions to ensnare the larger stony-iron meteorites. These\r\nmasses of iron and stone will offer less favorable mining possibilities,\r\nbut they can be turned into rocket-propelled and guided de luxe\r\nspace-cruisers. By this term, we do not mean that these natural\r\nspace-ships will house all the luxuries of the ocean-liners advertised\r\nin the travel magazines. Rather, we see them as providing roomy,\r\ncomfortable “underground” living quarters. Furthermore, their occupants\r\nwill be adequately protected by great thicknesses of metal and rock from\r\nthe injurious radiations of empty space, and the meteorites that make\r\nthe term “empty space” something of a misnomer.\r\n\r\nInitially, such worlds-in-miniature will be much sought after as\r\nlaboratory sites where the more violent and dangerous of the many\r\nexperimental tests which venturesome man will wish to conduct can be\r\ncarried on without danger to the close-packed billions populating the\r\nthen-crowded earth.\r\n\r\nLater on, these meteorites-turned-into-space-ships may be used to\r\nexplore the dangerous and faraway corners of the Solar System, since the\r\nvery substance of each massive meteoritic rocket-body will serve as an\r\nadequate and handy source of fuel supply.\r\n\r\nWhen men have learned to live on such “homes away from home,” it is\r\nquite possible that the larger of these modified meteorites, after their\r\ninteriors have been opened up for occupancy by the inroads of the\r\nfuel-hungry rocket-motors, may be steered into neighborly orbits about\r\nold Mother Earth. Here, these “natural” satellites will assume the\r\nunexciting but necessary roles of the extra living quarters that by then\r\nwill be so urgently needed to accommodate the mushrooming population of\r\nthe world of the future.\r\n\r\nPeople who live in these super-urban outliers of Mother Earth may take\r\nthe same pride in their natural, if converted, homes as many former city\r\ndwellers now take in the old-fashioned sprawling farmhouses they have\r\nrebuilt and occupied. Perhaps one of your descendants will live in such\r\na meteorite-orb, and occasionally point the finger of scorn at the more\r\nelegant but unpleasantly overcrowded artificial satellites preferred by\r\nthose migrants from teeming earth who lack the true pioneering instinct.\r\nWho knows!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          FOR FURTHER READING\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are especially interested in meteoritics, you already may have\r\nread some good books on general astronomy. There are many and most of\r\nthem are not too advanced for the beginner. Unfortunately, these books\r\ndevote but little space to meteoritics, the “Johnny-come-lately” of\r\nastronomy. Almost all of the writings on meteors and meteorites you will\r\nfind largely profitable to read are in professional meteoritical\r\npublications. A selected list of such publications, containing much or\r\nat least a worthwhile amount of material you will now be able to\r\nunderstand, is given below. Your chief difficulty in using this list\r\nwill be in finding some of the more important items in the holdings of\r\nyour public library, unless it is a large and well-stocked one. Your\r\nlibrarian, however, may be able to help you get the item from some other\r\nlibrary—perhaps from that of a nearby university or college.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           METEORIC ASTRONOMY\r\n\r\nMEBANE, A.

They are samples of cosmic\r\nmatter we can actually take in our hands. Science values them greatly as\r\nspecimens of _the only tangible_ substances we have from remote and\r\ninaccessible regions of the universe.\r\n\r\nThese mysterious “space nomads” are revealing to today’s scientists many\r\namazing and usable facts about conditions in outer space, about the age\r\nof our Solar System, and even about the probable constitution of our own\r\nhome planet.\r\n\r\nThis is an essential book for everybody who is keeping up with space\r\nscience and wishes to be well posted on these interesting but\r\npotentially dangerous co-voyagers that the astronauts may encounter.\r\n\r\nYou will also see in SPACE NOMADS:\r\n\r\nThe awesome event a meteorite-fall can be, with its violent sound and\r\nlight effects, and its terrific impact.\r\n\r\nThe excitement and the know-how of the hunt for these cosmic missiles.\r\n\r\nHow to tell the difference between a true meteorite and a mistaken one.\r\nDitto, meteorite craters.\r\n\r\nHow to make your own contribution to science by knowing the right way to\r\nobserve and report meteors and meteorites.\r\n\r\nWhat is inside them, and how they vary in content and structure.\r\n\r\nThe moon as a meteorite target.\r\n\r\nThe strange history of the subject—the amusing superstitions and\r\nfantastic notions believed until recently about “shooting stars” and\r\n“stones falling from the sky.”\r\n\r\nAnd more.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is an easy but sound introduction to the rapidly developing science\r\nof meteoritics. All of the information is up-to-date, much of it\r\nfirsthand, for the authors are themselves professional meteoriticists.\r\nDaily they are engaged in fieldwork, laboratory analysis, and advanced\r\nresearch at one of the world’s chief centers for this study.

Lincoln LaPaz\r\nis a leading pioneer as well as a widely recognized authority in\r\nmeteoritics, an important branch of astronomy. He was born on Lincoln’s\r\nbirthday, in Wichita, Kansas, where he grew up. Although both his\r\nmaster’s degree, at Harvard, and his doctorate, at Chicago, were in\r\nmathematics, his chief interest since boyhood has been in meteorites and\r\nmeteors. Today he is Director of the Institute of Meteoritics at the\r\nUniversity of New Mexico, where he also heads the Division of Astronomy.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:                                          RAVINI PHOTO\r\n     Jean LaPaz]\r\n\r\nJean LaPaz was born in Hanover, New Hampshire. Since girlhood she has\r\nbeen close to her father in his fascinating work. When she was a\r\nhigh-school student in Ohio, she did some serious fieldwork as a member\r\nof the Ohio State University Meteorite Expeditions. Later, she received\r\nboth a Bachelor of Science degree in geology and a Master of Arts in\r\nEnglish from the University of New Mexico. Science and Literature\r\ncontinue to be her mutually favoring interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n—Retained publication information from the printed edition: this eBook\r\n  is public-domain in the country of publication.\r\n\r\n—Silently corrected a few palpable typos.\r\n\r\n—In the text versions only, text in italics is delimited by\r\n  _underscores_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Space Nomads, by Lincoln LaPaz and Leota Jean LaPaz",
