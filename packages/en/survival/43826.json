HUTCHINSON, B.A., F.G.S.\r\n\r\n    AUTHOR OF \"THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF THE EARTH.\"\r\n\r\n    With Sixteen Full-page Illustrations.\r\n\r\nThey are as a great and noble architecture, first giving shelter,\r\ncomfort, and rest; and covered also with mighty sculpture and painted\r\nlegend.--RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n    New York:\r\n    MACMILLAN AND CO.\r\n    AND LONDON.\r\n\r\n    1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Copyright, 1891_,\r\n    BY MACMILLAN AND CO.\r\n\r\n\r\n    University Press:\r\n    JOHN WILSON AND SON, CAMBRIDGE, U.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO\r\n\r\nALL WHO LOVE MOUNTAINS AND HILLS\r\n\r\nThis little Book is Dedicated,\r\n\r\n   IN THE HOPE THAT EVEN A SLIGHT KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR PLACE IN\r\n   NATURE, AND PREVIOUS HISTORY, MAY ADD TO THE WONDER AND DELIGHT\r\n   WITH WHICH WE LOOK UPON THESE NOBLE FEATURES OF THE SURFACE OF\r\n   THE EARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that travelling is no longer a luxury for the rich, and thousands\r\nof people go every summer to spend their holidays among the\r\nmountains of Europe, and ladies climb Mont Blanc or ramble among the\r\nCarpathians, there must be many who would like to know something of\r\nthe secret of the hills, their origin, their architecture, and the\r\nforces that made them what they are.\r\n\r\nFor such this book is chiefly written. Those will best understand it\r\nwho take it with them on their travels, and endeavour by its use to\r\ninterpret what they see among the mountains; and they will find that\r\na little observation goes a long way to help them to read mountain\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped, however, that all, both young and old, who take an\r\nintelligent interest in the world around, though they may never have\r\nseen a mountain, may find these pages worth reading.\r\n\r\nIf readers do not find here answers to all their questions, they\r\nmay be reminded that it is not possible within the present limits\r\nto give more than a brief sketch of the subject, leaving the gaps\r\nto be filled in by a study of the larger and more important works\r\non geology. The author, assuming that the reader knows nothing of\r\nthis fascinating science, has endeavoured to interpret into ordinary\r\nlanguage the story of the hills as it is written in the rocks of\r\nwhich they are made.\r\n\r\nIt can scarcely be denied that a little knowledge of natural objects\r\ngreatly adds to our appreciation of them, besides affording a deep\r\nsource of pleasure, in revealing the harmony, law, and order by which\r\nall things in this wonderful world are governed. Mountains, when\r\nonce we begin to observe them, seem to become more than ever our\r\ncompanions,--to take us into their counsels, and to teach us many a\r\nlesson about the great part they play in the order of things. And\r\nsurely our admiration of their beauty is not lessened, but rather\r\nincreased, when we learn how much we and all living things owe to\r\nthe life-giving streams that flow continually from them. The writer\r\nhas, somewhat reluctantly, omitted certain parts of the subject\r\nwhich, though very interesting to the geologist, can hardly be made\r\nattractive to general readers.\r\n\r\nThus, the cause of earth movements, by which mountains are pushed up\r\nfar above the plains that lie at their feet, is at present a matter\r\nof speculation; and it is difficult to express in ordinary language\r\nthe ideas that have been put forward on this subject. Again, the\r\ncurious internal changes, which we find to have taken place in the\r\nrocks of which mountains are composed, are very interesting to those\r\nwho know something of the minerals of which rocks are made up, and\r\ntheir chemical composition; but it was found impossible to render\r\nthese matters sufficiently simple.\r\n\r\nSo again with regard to the geological structure of mountain-chains.\r\nThis had to be very briefly treated, in order to avoid introducing\r\ndetails which would be too complicated for a book of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe author desires to acknowledge his obligations to the writings\r\nof Sir A. Geikie; Professor Bonney, Professor Green, and Professor\r\nShaler, of Harvard University; the volumes of the \"Alpine Journal;\"\r\n\"The Earth,\" by Reclus; the \"Encyclopædia Britannica.\" Canon Isaac\r\nTaylor's \"Words and Places,\" have also been made use of; and if in\r\nevery case the reference is not given, the writer hopes the omission\r\nwill be pardoned. A few passages from Mr. Ruskin's \"Modern Painters\"\r\nhave been quoted, in the hope that others may be led to read that\r\nwonderful book, and to learn more about mountains and clouds, and\r\nmany other things, at the feet of one of the greatest teachers of the\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nSome of our engravings are taken from the justly celebrated\r\nphotographs of the High Alps,[1] by the late Mr. W. Donkin, whose\r\npremature death among the Caucasus Mountains was deeply deplored\r\nby all. Those reproduced were kindly lent by his brother, Mr. A. E.\r\nDonkin, of Rugby. To Messrs. Valentine & Son of Dundee, Mr. Wilson\r\nof Aberdeen, and to Messrs. Frith we are indebted for permission to\r\nreproduce some of their admirable photographs; also to Messrs. James\r\nHow & Sons of Farringdon Street, for three excellent photographs of\r\nrock-sections taken with the microscope.\r\n\r\n  [1] Published by Messrs.

A very slight\r\nacquaintance with the classical writers of antiquity will suffice\r\nto convince any one that Greeks and Romans did so regard them. They\r\nwere not so familiar with mountains as we are; for there were no\r\nroads through them, as now through the Alps, or the Highlands of\r\nScotland,--to say nothing of the all-pervading railway. It would,\r\nhowever, be a great mistake to suppose that the ancients did not\r\nobserve and enjoy the beauties of Nature. The fair and fertile\r\nplain, the vine-clad slopes of the lower hill-ranges, and the\r\n\"many-twinkling smile of ocean\" were seen and loved by all who had\r\na mind to appreciate the beautiful. The poems of Homer and Virgil\r\nwould alone be sufficient to prove this. But the higher ranges,\r\nuntrodden by the foot of man, were gazed at, not with admiration,\r\nbut with religious awe; for men looked upon mountains as the abode\r\nof the gods. They dwelt in the rich plain, which they cultivated,\r\nand beside the sweet waters of some river; for food and drink are\r\nthe first necessities of life. But they left the high hills alone,\r\nand in fancy peopled them with the \"Immortals\" who ruled their\r\ndestiny,--controlling also the winds and the lightning, the rain and\r\nthe clouds, which seem to have their home among the mountains. A\r\nchildlike fear of the unknown, coupled with religious awe, made them\r\navoid the lofty and barren hills, from which little was to be got\r\nbut wild honey and a scanty supply of game. There were also dangers\r\nto be encountered from the fury of the storm and the avalanche; but\r\nthe safer ground of the plains below would reward their toil with an\r\nample supply of corn and other necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nIn classical times, and also in the Middle Ages, the mountains,\r\nas well as glens and rivers, were supposed to be peopled with\r\nfairies, nymphs, elves, and all sorts of strange beings; and even\r\nnow travellers among the mountains of Switzerland, Norway, Wales,\r\nor Scotland find that it is not long since the simple folk of these\r\nregions believed in the existence of such beings, and attributed to\r\ntheir agency many things which they could not otherwise explain.\r\n\r\nOf all the nations of antiquity the Jews seem to have shown the\r\ngreatest appreciation of mountain scenery; and in no ancient writings\r\ndo we find so many or so eloquent allusions to the hills as in the\r\nOld Testament. But here again one cannot fail to trace the same\r\nfeelings of religious awe. The Law was given to their forefathers\r\nin the desert amidst the thunders of Sinai. To them the earth was\r\nliterally Jehovah's footstool, and the clouds were His tabernacle.\r\n\"If He do but touch the hills, they shall smoke.\"\r\n\r\nBut this awe was not unmixed with other and more comforting thoughts.\r\nThey felt that those cloud-capped towers were symbols of strength and\r\nthe abode of Him who would help them in their need. For so we find\r\nthe psalmists regarding them; and with our very different conceptions\r\nof the earth's natural features, we can but dimly perceive and\r\nrealise the full force and meaning of the words, \"I will lift up mine\r\neyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.\"\r\n\r\nTo take another example from antiquity, we find that the Himalayas\r\nand the source of the Ganges have from very early times been\r\nconsidered as holy by the people of India. Thousands of pilgrims from\r\nall parts of that vast country still continue to seek salvation in\r\nthe holy waters of the Ganges, and at its sacred sources in the snowy\r\nHimalayas. And to those who know India the wondrous snowclad peaks of\r\nthe Himalayas still seem to be surrounded with somewhat of the same\r\nhalo of glory as of old.\r\n\r\nMountains are intimately associated with the history of nations, and\r\nhave contributed much to the moulding of the human mind and the\r\ncharacter of those who dwell among them; they have alike inspired the\r\nmind of the artist, the poet, the reformer, and the visionary seeking\r\nrepose for his soul, that, dwelling far from the strife and turmoil\r\nof the world, he may contemplate alone the glory of the Eternal\r\nBeing. They have been the refuge of the afflicted and the persecuted;\r\nthey have braced the minds and bodies of heroes who have dwelt for a\r\ntime among them before descending once more to the plain that they\r\nmight play some noble part in the progress of the world.\r\n\r\nMoses, while leading the flock of his father-in-law to the back of\r\nthe wilderness, came to Mount Horeb and received the divine summons\r\nto return to Egypt and lead Israel out of bondage. David, with his\r\nsix hundred followers, fleeing from the face of Saul, found a refuge\r\nin the hill country; and the life of peril and adventure which he\r\nled during these years of persecution was a part of his training for\r\nthe great future task of ruling Israel, which he performed so well.\r\nElijah summoned the false prophets of Baal and Asherah to Mount\r\nCarmel and slew them at the brook Kishon; and a little later we find\r\nhim at Mount Horeb listening, not to the wind or to the earthquake\r\nor to the fire, but to the \"still small voice\" telling him to return\r\nand anoint Jehu to be king.\r\n\r\nOr, to take another example from a later age, we find that Mahomet's\r\nfavourite resort was a cave at the foot of Mount Hira, north of\r\nMecca; here in dark and wild surroundings his mind was wrought up to\r\nrhapsodic enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nAnd many, like these leaders of men, have received in mountain\r\nretreats a firmness and tenacity of purpose giving them the right\r\nto be leaders, and the power to redress human wrongs; or, it may\r\nbe, a temper of mind and spirit enabling them to soar into regions\r\nof thought and contemplation untrodden by the careless and more\r\nluxurious multitudes who dwell on the plains below. Perhaps Mr. Lewis\r\nMorris was unconsciously offering his testimony to the influence of\r\nmountains when he wrote those words which he puts into the mouth of\r\npoor Marsyas,--\r\n\r\n                        \"More it is than ease,\r\n    Palace and pomp, honours and luxuries,\r\n    To have seen white presences upon the hills,\r\n    To have heard the voices of the eternal gods.\"[2]\r\n\r\n  [2] Epic of Hades.\r\nThe thunder and lightning, storm and cloud, as well as the soft\r\nbeauty of colour, and the harmony of mountain outline, have been a\r\npart, and a very important part, of their training. The exhilarating\r\nair, the struggle with the elements in their fierceness, the rugged\r\nstrength of granite, seem to have possessed the very souls of such\r\nmen, and made them like \"the strong ones,\"--the immortal beings to\r\nwhom in all previous ages the races of mankind have assigned their\r\nabode in the hills, as the Greek gods were supposed to dwell on Mount\r\nOlympus. On these heights such men seem to have gained something of\r\nthe strength of Him who dwells in the heavens far above their highest\r\npeaks,--\"the strength of the hills,\" which, as the Hebrew poet says,\r\n\"is His also.\"\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of the attitude of the human mind towards mountains in\r\nthe past; let us now consider the light in which they are regarded\r\nat the present time by all thoughtful and cultivated people. And it\r\ndoes not require a moment's consideration to perceive that a very\r\ngreat change has taken place. Instead of regarding them with horror\r\nor aversion, we look upon them with wonder and delight; we watch\r\nthem hour by hour whenever for a brief season of holiday we take\r\nup our abode near or among them. We come back to them year by year\r\nto breathe once more the pure air which so frequently restores the\r\ninvalid to health and brings back the colour to faded cheeks. We love\r\nto watch the ever-varying lights and shades upon them, as the day\r\ngoes by. But it is towards evening that the most enchanting scenes\r\nare to be witnessed, when the sinking sun sheds its golden rays upon\r\ntheir slopes, or tinges their summits with floods of crimson light;\r\nand then presently, after the sun has gone down, pale mists begin\r\nto rise, and the hills seem more majestic than ever. Later on, as\r\nthe full moon appears from behind a bank of cloud, those wonderful\r\nmoonlight effects may be seen which must be familiar to all who know\r\nthe mountains as they are in summer or autumn,--scenes such as the\r\nwriter has frequently witnessed in the Highlands of Scotland, but\r\nwhich only the poet can adequately describe.\r\n\r\nThere are few sights in Nature which more powerfully impress the mind\r\nthan a sunset among the mountains. General Sir Richard Strachey\r\nconcludes his description of the Himalayas with the following\r\nstriking passage:\r\n\r\n   \"Here may the eye, as it sweeps along the horizon, embrace a\r\n   line of snowclad mountains such as exist in no other part of\r\n   the world, stretching over one third of the entire circle,\r\n   at a distance of forty or fifty miles, their peaks towering\r\n   over a sea of intervening ranges piled one behind another,\r\n   whose extent on either hand is lost in the remote distance,\r\n   and of which the nearest rises from a gulf far down beneath\r\n   the spectator's feet, where may be seen the silver line that\r\n   marks a river's course, or crimson fields of amaranth and the\r\n   dwellings of man. Sole representative of animal life, some\r\n   great eagle floats high overhead in the pure dark-blue sky,\r\n   or, unused to man, fearlessly sweeps down within a few yards\r\n   to gaze at the stranger who intrudes among these solitudes of\r\n   Nature. As the sun sinks, the cold grey shadow of the summit\r\n   where we stand is thrown forward, slowly stealing over the\r\n   distant hills, and veiling their glowing purples as it goes,\r\n   carries the night up to the feet of the great snowy peaks,\r\n   which still rise radiant in the rosy light above the now\r\n   darkening world. From east to west in succession the splendour\r\n   fades away from one point after another, and the vast shadow of\r\n   the earth is rapidly drawn across the whole vault of heaven.\r\n   One more departing day is added to the countless series which\r\n   has silently witnessed the deathlike change that passes over\r\n   the eternal snows, as they are left raising their cold pale\r\n   fronts against the now leaden sky; till slowly with the\r\n   deepening night the world of mountains rises again, as it were,\r\n   to a new life, under the changed light of the thousand stars\r\n   which stud the firmament and shine with a brilliancy unknown\r\n   except in the clear rarefied air of these sublime heights.\"\r\n\r\nYear by year a larger number of busy workers from our great towns,\r\navailing themselves of the increased facilities for travel, come to\r\nthe mountains to spend their summer holidays,--some to the Swiss\r\nAlps, others to Wales, Cumberland, Norway, or the Highlands of\r\nScotland. There are few untrodden valleys in these regions, few of\r\nthe more important mountains which have not been climbed.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of mountains, thanks to the labours of a zealous army\r\nof workers, is now considerable. The professors of physical science\r\nhave been busy making important observations on the condition of\r\nthe atmosphere in the higher regions; geographers have noted their\r\nheights and mapped their leading contours. Geologists have done a\r\nvast amount of work in ascertaining the composition and arrangement\r\nof the rocks of which mountain chains are composed, in observing\r\ntheir peculiar structures, in recording the changes which are\r\ncontinually effecting their waste and decay, and thus interpreting\r\nthe story of the hills as it is written in the very rocks of which\r\nthey are built up.\r\n\r\nNaturalists have collected and noted the peculiar plants and animals\r\nwhich have their home among the hills, and so the forms of life, both\r\nanimal and vegetable, which inhabit the mountains of Europe, and some\r\nother countries, are now fairly well known.\r\n\r\nThe historian, the antiquary, and the student of languages have\r\nmade interesting discoveries with regard to the mountain races of\r\nmankind. And only to mention this country, such writers as Scott,\r\nWordsworth, and Ruskin have given us in verse and prose descriptions\r\nof mountain scenery which will take a permanent place in literature;\r\nwhile Turner, our great landscape-painter, has expressed the glories\r\nof mountain scenery in pictures which speak more eloquently than\r\nmany words. Thus we see that whatever line of inquiry be chosen, our\r\nsubject is full of varied interest.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the characteristics of mountain races, it is not easy\r\nto say to what extent people in different parts of the world who\r\nlive among mountains share the same virtues or the same failings;\r\nbut the most obvious traits in the character of the mountaineer\r\nseem to be the result of his natural surroundings. Thus we find\r\nmountaineers generally endowed with hardihood, strength, and bravery.\r\nTo spend one's days on the hillsides for a large part of the year, as\r\nshepherds and others do in Scotland or Wales, and to walk some miles\r\nevery day in pure bracing air, must be healthy and tend to develop\r\nthe muscles of the body; and so we find the highlanders of all\r\ncountries are usually muscular, strong, and capable of endurance. And\r\nthere can be little doubt that mountain races are kept up to a high\r\nstandard of strength and endurance by a rigorous and constant weeding\r\nout of the weakly ones, especially among children. And if only the\r\nstronger live to grow up and become parents, the chances are that\r\ntheir children will be strong too. Thus Nature exercises a kind of\r\n\"selection;\" and we have consequently \"the survival of the fittest.\"\r\nThis \"selection,\" together with the healthy lives they lead, is\r\nprobably sufficient to account for their strength and hardiness.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, mountaineers are celebrated for their fighting\r\nqualities. The fierce Afghans who have often faced a British army,\r\nand sometimes victoriously; the brave Swiss peasantry, who have\r\nmore than once fought nobly for freedom; the Highlanders, who have\r\ncontributed so largely to the success of British arms in nearly\r\nall parts of the world, and whose forefathers defied even the\r\nall-conquering Roman in their mountain strongholds,--these and many\r\nothers all show the same valour and power of endurance. Etymologists,\r\nwhose learned researches into the meaning of words have thrown so\r\nmuch light on the ages before history was written, tell us that the\r\nPicts were so called from their fighting qualities, and that the\r\nword \"Pict\" is derived from the Gaelic \"peicta,\" a fighting man. And\r\nJulius Cæsar says the chief god of the Britons was the god of war.\r\n\r\nIn some countries--as, for instance, Greece, Italy, and Spain--the\r\nmountains are infested with banditti and robbers, who often become a\r\nterror to the neighbourhood. In more peaceful and orderly countries,\r\nhowever, we find among mountaineers many noble qualities,--such\r\nas patience, honesty, simplicity of life, thrift, a dignified\r\nself-reliance, together with true courtesy and hospitality. This is\r\nhigh praise; but who that knows mountain peasants would say it is\r\nundeserved? How many a tired traveller among the hills of Scotland\r\nor Wales has had reason to be grateful for welcome, food, and rest\r\nin some little cottage in a far-away glen! How many friendships have\r\nthus been formed! How many a pleasant talk has beguiled the time\r\nduring a storm or shower! The old feuds are forgotten now that the\r\nSaxon stranger and invader is at peace with the Celtic people whom\r\nhis forefathers drove into the hills. The castles, once centres of\r\noppression or scenes of violence, lie in peaceful and picturesque\r\nruins, and add not a little to the interest of one's travels in the\r\nNorth. What true courtesy and consideration one meets with at the\r\nhands of these honest folk, among whom the old kindly usages have\r\nnot died out! Often too poor to be afflicted with the greed and\r\nthirst for wealth, which frequently marks the man of the plain as\r\ncompared with the man of the hills,--the Lowlander as compared with\r\nthe Highlander,--they exhibit many of those simple virtues which\r\none hardly expects to meet with among busy townspeople, all bent on\r\nmaking money, or as the phrase is, \"getting on in life.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BEN LOMOND. FROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY J. VALENTINE.]\r\n\r\n    \"The mountain cheer, the frosty skies,\r\n    Breed purer wits, inventive eyes;\r\n    And then the moral of the place\r\n    Hints summits of heroic grace.\r\n    Men in these crags a fastness find\r\n    To fight corruption of the mind;\r\n    The insanity of towns to stem\r\n    With simpleness for stratagem.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Skene, the Scotch historian, records a touching case of the\r\ndevotion of Highlanders to their chief. He says,--\r\n\r\n   \"There is perhaps no instance in which the attachment of the\r\n   clan to their chief was so strongly manifested as in the\r\n   case of the Macphersons of Cluny after the disaster of 'the\r\n   Forty-five.' The chief having been deeply engaged in that\r\n   insurrection, his life became of course forfeited to the laws;\r\n   but neither the hope of reward nor the fear of danger could\r\n   induce any one of his people to betray him. For nine years\r\n   he lived concealed in a cave a short distance from his own\r\n   house; it was situated in the front of a woody precipice of\r\n   which the trees and shelving rocks concealed the entrance. The\r\n   cave had been dug by his own people, who worked at night and\r\n   conveyed the stones and rubbish into a neighbouring lake, in\r\n   order that no vestige of their labour might appear and lead to\r\n   the discovery of the retreat. In this asylum he continued to\r\n   live secure, receiving by night the occasional visits of his\r\n   friends, and sometimes by day, when the soldiers had begun to\r\n   slacken the vigour of their pursuit. Upwards of one thousand\r\n   persons were privy to his concealment, and a reward of £1,000\r\n   was offered to any one who should give information against\r\n   him.... But although the soldiers were animated by the hope\r\n   of reward, and their officers by promise of promotion for\r\n   the apprehension of this proscribed individual, yet so true\r\n   were his people, so inflexibly strict in their promise of\r\n   secrecy, and so dextrous in conveying to him the necessaries he\r\n   required in his long confinement, not a trace of him could be\r\n   discovered, nor an individual base enough to give a hint to his\r\n   detriment.\"\r\n\r\nThe mountaineer is a true gentleman. However poor, however ignorant\r\nor superstitious, one perceives in him a refinement of manner which\r\ncannot fail to command admiration. His readiness to share his\r\nbest with the stranger and to render any service in his power are\r\npleasing traits in his character. But there is one sad feature about\r\nmountaineers of the present day which one frequently notices in\r\ndistricts where many tourists come,--especially English or American.\r\nThey are, we regret to say, losing their independence, their simple,\r\nold-fashioned ways, and becoming servile and greedy,--at least in the\r\ntowns and villages. Such changes seem, alas! inevitable when rich\r\ntownspeople, bent on pleasure or sport, invade the recesses of the\r\nhills where poverty usually reigns. On the one hand, we have people,\r\noften with long purses, eager for enjoyment, waiting to be fed,\r\nhoused, or otherwise entertained; on the other hand, poor people,\r\nanxious to \"make hay while the sun shines\" and to extract as much\r\nmoney as possible from \"the visitors,\" who often allow themselves\r\nto be unmercifully fleeced. Then there are in the Highlands the\r\nsportsmen, who require a large following of \"gillies\" to attend them\r\nin their wanderings, pay them highly for their services, and dismiss\r\nthem at the end of the season; and so the men are in many cases left\r\nwithout employment all the winter and spring. Is it, then, surprising\r\nthat they give way to a natural tendency to idleness, and fall into\r\nother bad habits? Any visitor who spends a winter, or part of one,\r\nin the Highlands will be better able to realise the extent of this\r\nevil, which is by no means small; and one cannot help regretting that\r\nthe sportsmen's pleasure and the tourist's holiday should involve\r\nresults of such grave consequence. We are inclined to think that in\r\nthese days sport is overdone, and wish it could be followed without\r\ntaking the hillman away from the work he would otherwise find, and\r\nwhich would render him a more useful member of society. With the\r\nagitation going on in some parts against deer-forests we do not\r\nfeel much sympathy, because they are based on the erroneous idea\r\nthat \"crofters\" could make a living out of the land thus enclosed;\r\nwhereas those who know the land and its value for agricultural\r\npurposes tell us that with the exception of a few small patches here\r\nand there, hardly worth mentioning, it could not possibly be made to\r\nproduce enough to maintain crofters and their families. Nevertheless,\r\nanother way of looking at the matter is this: that the man who merely\r\nministers to the pleasure of others richer than himself loses some of\r\nthe self-respect and independence which he would acquire by working\r\nin his own way for a living.\r\n\r\nThe same changes for the worse are still more manifest in\r\nSwitzerland; and even in some parts of Norway the people are being\r\nsimilarly spoiled. Mr. Ruskin, speaking of the former country, says:\r\n\r\n   \"I believe that every franc now spent by travellers among\r\n   the Alps tends more or less to the undermining of whatever\r\n   special greatness there is in the Swiss character; and the\r\n   persons I met in Switzerland whose position and modes of life\r\n   render them best able to give me true information respecting\r\n   the present state of their country, among many causes of\r\n   national deterioration, spoke with chief fear of the influx\r\n   of English wealth, gradually connecting all industry with the\r\n   wants of strangers, and inviting all idleness to depend upon\r\n   their casual help, thus resolving the ancient consistency and\r\n   pastoral simplicity of the mountain life into the two irregular\r\n   trades of the innkeeper and mendicant.\"[3]\r\n\r\n  [3] Modern Painters, vol. iv.\r\n\r\nMountain people have still their superstitions; since the\r\nintroduction of railways many of the old legends and popular myths\r\nhave died out, but even what is left is interesting to the student of\r\nfolk-lore,--indeed, we might say, to every one.\r\n\r\nSir A. Geikie, speaking of Scotch mountain scenery says,--\r\n\r\n    \"To the influence of scenery of this kind on the mind of a\r\n   people at once observant and imaginative, such legends as that\r\n   of the Titans should in all likelihood be ascribed. It would be\r\n   interesting to trace back these legends to their cradle, and to\r\n   mark how much they owe to the character of the scenery amongst\r\n   which they took their rise. Perhaps it would be found that the\r\n   rugged outlines of the Boeotian hills had no small share in\r\n   the framing of Hesiod's graphic story of that primeval warfare\r\n   wherein the combatants fought with huge rocks, which, darkening\r\n   the air as they flew, at last buried the discomfited Titans\r\n   deep beneath the surface of the land. Nor would it be difficult\r\n   to trace a close connection between the present scenery of our\r\n   own country and some of the time-honoured traditionary stories\r\n   of giants and hero kings, warlocks and witches, or between the\r\n   doings of the Scandinavian Hrimthursar, or Frost Giants, and\r\n   the more characteristic features of the landscapes and climate\r\n   of the North.\"[4]\r\n\r\n  [4] Scenery of Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe following passage from Ruskin brings out more strongly the\r\neffects of mountains on men,--a subject to which he has given much\r\nattention:--\r\n\r\n   \"We shall find, on the one hand, the mountains of Greece and\r\n   Italy, forming all the loveliest dreams, first of Pagan, then\r\n   of Christian mythology, on the other, those of Scandinavia, to\r\n   be the first sources of whatever mental (as well as military)\r\n   power was brought by the Normans into Southern Europe. Normandy\r\n   itself is, to all intents and purposes, a hill country.... We\r\n   have thus one branch of the Northern religious imagination\r\n   rising among the Scandinavian fiords, tempered in France\r\n   by various encounters with elements of Arabian, Italian,\r\n   Provençal, or other Southern poetry, and then reacting upon\r\n   Southern England; while other forms of the same rude religious\r\n   imagination, resting like clouds upon the mountains of Scotland\r\n   and Wales, met and mingled with the Norman Christianity,\r\n   retaining even to the latest times some dark colour of\r\n   superstition, but giving all its poetical and military pathos\r\n   to Scottish poetry, and a peculiar sternness and wildness of\r\n   tone to the Reformed faith, in its manifestations among the\r\n   Scottish hills.\"[5]\r\n\r\n  [5] Modern Painters, vol. iv.\r\n\r\nThe Alps, like most other mountainous countries, have their fair\r\nshare of legends, some of which are very grotesque. We have selected\r\nthe following, as related by Professor Bonney.[6] The wild huntsman's\r\nyell is still heard in many places by the shuddering peasants as his\r\nphantom train sweeps by the châlet. There is also the wild goat-herd,\r\na wicked lad, who crucified an old he-goat and drove his flock to\r\nworship it; lightning consumed him; and now he wanders forever over\r\nthe Alps, miserably wailing.\r\n\r\n  [6] \"The Alpine Regions of Switzerland\" (Deighton, Bell, & Co.),\r\n  a most interesting book, especially for travellers.\r\n\r\nWhen the glacier of Gétroz burst, the Archfiend himself was seen\r\nswimming down the Rhone, with a drawn sword in one hand and a golden\r\nball in the other; when opposite to Martigny he halted, and at his\r\nbidding the waters rose and swept away part of the town. A vast\r\nmultitude of imps was seen about the same time on a mountain in the\r\nVal de Bagnes by two mendicant friars from Sion, who, hearing of this\r\nunlawful assembly, had gone out as detectives to learn what mischief\r\nwas hatching.\r\n\r\nMany places also have their spectral animals, the Valois, according\r\nto Tschudi, being the headquarters of these legends. There are also\r\npygmies to be seen in the lonely mountains, like the Norwegian\r\ntrolls, and brownies who make or mar the house, according as the\r\ngoodwife is neat or a slattern.\r\n\r\nMany Alpine stories have reference to the sudden destruction of\r\npastures by the fall of rocks or ice. Here is one from the Clariden\r\nAlps:--\r\n\r\n   Once upon a time these were fertile pastures, on which dwelt a\r\n   \"senn.\" He grew rich, so that none could match him in wealth;\r\n   but at the same time he grew proud and haughty, and spurned\r\n   both the laws of Nature and the commandments of God. He was\r\n   so foolishly fond of his mistress that he paved the way from\r\n   the châlet to the byre with cheeses, lest she should soil her\r\n   feet, and cared so little for his mother that when she lay at\r\n   his door fainting with hunger, he offered her only milk to\r\n   drink in which he had thrown the foulest refuse. Righteously\r\n   indignant, she turned away, calling upon Heaven to punish such\r\n   an insult. Before she reached her home, the rocks and ice had\r\n   descended, crushing beneath them her wicked son, his mistress,\r\n   and possessions.\r\n\r\n   In the neighbourhood of Monte Rosa there is a tradition that\r\n   a valley exists in the heart of that mountain the entrance to\r\n   which has been sealed up by impassable glaciers, though the\r\n   floor of the \"cirque\" within is still a rich pasturage. In a\r\n   certain valley they point out a spring which bursts from the\r\n   ground, as the outlet of the torrent by which it is watered.\r\n   Once, said they, a _chasseur_ found the bed of this stream dry,\r\n   and creeping up its subterranean channel, arrived on the floor\r\n   of the valley. It was a huntsman's paradise; chamois were there\r\n   in plenty, bears also, and even bouquetins, wandering over the\r\n   richest pastures. He retraced his steps to announce the good\r\n   news; but when he returned again, the waters had resumed their\r\n   course, and the place has ever since remained inaccessible.\r\n\r\nMountains play a very important part in human history. In the first\r\nplace, they are natural barriers separating the nations of the\r\nworld from one another, and tending to keep them confined within\r\ncertain definite bounds; we say, tending to keep them thus confined,\r\nbecause, as every one knows, these barriers have again and again been\r\nsurmounted by conquering armies. The rugged Alps could not ward off\r\nHannibal, who made his way through them to march upon the capital of\r\nthe Roman empire. In like manner Napoleon defied this great natural\r\nrampart, made a road through it, and came to Italy. No mountains\r\nwould seem to be quite impassable; but although liable in the course\r\nof ages to be occasionally overrun, they afford good protection and\r\nproduce a feeling of security.\r\n\r\nThe Himalayas separate our great Indian empire from that of China;\r\nand we do not at present apprehend an invasion from that quarter.\r\nThe Suliman Mountains divide us from the Afghans, and the great\r\nRussian and Persian empires farther west. Still, we know that in the\r\neleventh century a great Mahometan invasion of India took place;\r\nour own armies have more than once penetrated to Kabul. Perhaps the\r\ncommon garden wall separating adjacent suburban residences furnishes\r\na suitable illustration of the great natural walls which divide, not\r\nhouseholds or families, but much larger families than these,--the\r\nnations of the world.\r\n\r\nJust as unruly boys sometimes climb over the neighbour's wall and\r\nplay games in a garden which is not their own; or as burglars may\r\nsurmount these obstacles to their progress, and finding a way\r\ninto the house by a back door or kitchen window, commence their\r\nravages,--so a neighbouring (but not neighbourly) nation, bent on\r\nconquest, may invade some natural garden of the world, such as\r\nIndia, by forcing their way through physical barriers which for\r\nordinary purposes serve to protect those within.\r\n\r\nThe Thian Shan Mountains divide Russia from China's sphere of\r\ninfluence. The Caucasus Mountains separate Russia from Asia Minor.\r\nAustro-Hungary is bounded by the Carpathians, Spain by the Pyrenees.\r\nThe Alps of Switzerland separate four nations not very friendly\r\nto each other; and lastly, in our own country the Cheviot Hills,\r\ntogether with the Tweed, form the boundary between Scotland and\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nWhere there are no mountains or hills, rivers sometimes serve as\r\nboundaries, but of course they do not answer the purpose so well.\r\nSometimes a nation actually builds a wall for a boundary. Of this the\r\ngreat wall of China and the Roman wall between the Cheviots and the\r\nSolway Firth are familiar examples.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, mountains have always been a refuge and shelter\r\nfor conquered races; and the primitive tribes who once lived in the\r\nplains have been forced by adverse circumstances to take to the\r\nhills. This has taken place over and over again.\r\n\r\nWe know that the Celtic people now living in Brittany, Devonshire,\r\nCornwall, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, though now considerably\r\nmixed, are the descendants of the old Celtic inhabitants of France\r\nand Britain. But there is a great deal of unwritten history for which\r\nwe may look in vain to the ordinary sources of information, such as\r\nbooks, and which is only to be read in quite different records,--in\r\nantiquities buried up in peat-beds, in bogs, in ruins and ancient\r\nforts, or camps; and last but not least, in the names of places,\r\nrivers, or mountains. The hills, the valleys, the rivers, are the\r\nonly writing-tablets on which unlettered nations have been able to\r\ninscribe their annals. For this kind of history we must go to the\r\nantiquary, and, above all, to the philologist, who tells us the\r\nmeaning of the names of places, and who the people were who gave the\r\nnames that we see on our maps. The great advances which have of late\r\nyears been made in our knowledge of the primeval races of men, or\r\nat least of nations but little known in the annals of history, are\r\nlargely due to the interpretation of the obscure records preserved in\r\nlocal names. The Celtic, the Iberian, the Teutonic, the Scandinavian,\r\nand Sclavonic races have thus for the most part made known to us\r\ntheir migrations, conquests, and defeats. And so by studying the\r\nnames of places, rivers, and hills, as well as by careful collection\r\nof works of art, implements, coins, such as may be seen in many a\r\nmuseum, it has been possible to read a great deal of early history\r\nwhich would otherwise have been lost.\r\n\r\nThose who have studied these matters say they can trace wave after\r\nwave of population which has thus left its mark,--Gaelic, Cymric (or\r\nWelsh), Saxon, Anglian, Norwegian, Danish, Norman, and Flemish. Thus\r\nit can be proved from the names on the map that almost the whole of\r\nEngland was once Celtic, whereas now the Celts are almost entirely\r\nconfined to the hills. The Peak of Derbyshire and the mountains of\r\nCumberland retain a greater number of Celtic names than the districts\r\nsurrounding them; and the hills of Devonshire long served as a\r\nbarrier to protect the Celts of Cornwall from Anglo-Saxon conquerors.\r\n\r\nBut even mountain races are often a good deal mixed, and in the\r\nPyrenees we find the descendants of the Iberians, who, a very long\r\ntime ago, were driven from the lowlands of France and Spain. These\r\nIberians are a very interesting race, of short stature, with long\r\nheads, and dark hair and eyes. This old type is to be met with in\r\nWales and the Highlands even in the present day. And so we learn--if\r\nthese conclusions are sound--that even the Celts in their early days\r\nwere invaders, and drove before them an older population. This race,\r\nit seems, lived in Europe a very long time ago, before the discovery\r\nof metals, when people made axes, hammers, and spear-heads out of\r\nflints or other stones; and so they are said to belong to \"the Stone\r\nAge.\" Their remains are found in many of the caves which of late\r\nyears have been explored. Possibly the ancient people of Switzerland\r\nwho lived in wooden houses, erected on piles near the shores of lakes\r\n(probably for safety), were also of the same stock.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to find how people living in separate valleys among the\r\nmountains of Switzerland have, in the course of time, become so much\r\nunlike their neighbours that they can hardly understand each other's\r\nspeech, so effectually have the mountains kept them apart. In some\r\ndistricts almost every valley has its separate dialect. Switzerland\r\nis only twice the size of Wales, yet the local names are derived\r\nfrom half a dozen different languages, three or four of which are\r\nstill spoken by the people. In the Alps, too, the same mixture of\r\nCeltic with an older Iberian stock has been detected.\r\n\r\nA curious reversal of the usual order of things is noticed by the\r\nlate Dean Stanley in his \"Sinai and Palestine.\" He points out that\r\nthe Jews took possession of many of the hills of Palestine soon after\r\nthe invasion under Joshua, but could not drive out the peoples of the\r\nplains, because they were better armed, and had chariots of iron in\r\ngreat number. The conquerors in this case kept to the hills; while\r\nthe Canaanites, Philistines, and other inhabitants of the country\r\nretained for a long time their hold of the lower ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE USES OF MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n   The valleys only feed; the mountains feed and guard and\r\n   strengthen us.--RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not an exaggeration to say that there are no physical\r\nfeatures of the surface of the earth which render such a variety of\r\nservices as mountains. The operations which they perform involve\r\nsuch far-reaching consequences that it is difficult to say where\r\ntheir effects cease. Indeed, it might almost be maintained that\r\nthey are the mainspring of the world,--as far as its surface is\r\nconcerned,--for it would fare ill with mankind if they were removed\r\nor in some way destroyed. Things would then very soon come to a\r\nstandstill. The soil would become exhausted; streams would cease to\r\nflow; and the world would become a kind of stagnant pool.\r\n\r\nThe three main services of the hills are these:--\r\n\r\n   I. Mountains help to condense water-vapour from the atmosphere,\r\n   thus bringing back to the earth moisture which it loses\r\n   continually by evaporation.\r\n\r\n   II. Mountains are elevated reservoirs of water in one form or\r\n   another, and thus not only feed the streams and rivers, but\r\n   give them force and direction as well.\r\n\r\n   III. Mountains suffer themselves to be slowly worn away in\r\n   order that the face of the earth may be renewed; in other\r\n   words, they die that we, and all created things, may live.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _Mountains help to condense water-vapour from the atmosphere, thus\r\nbringing back to the earth the moisture which it loses continually by\r\nevaporation._ Every one knows that there is abundance of water-vapour\r\nin the atmosphere, but the question arises, How does it get there?\r\nThe answer to this lies in the simple fact that every surface of\r\nwater exposed to the air undergoes loss by evaporation. If you wish\r\nto satisfy yourself on this point, place a saucer of water in your\r\nroom, and in a few days it will all be gone. We hang clothes out to\r\ndry, and so avail ourselves of this curious power that air has of\r\ntaking up water in the form of vapour. Steam, or water-vapour, is\r\nreally invisible, though we frequently talk of seeing the steam\r\nissuing from a locomotive; but what we really see is a cloud of\r\ncondensed steam, and such clouds,[7] like those that we see floating\r\nin the air, are really masses of little tiny particles of water which\r\ncan reflect or throw back the light which falls upon them, and thus\r\nthey become visible. Again, a kettle of water, if left too long on\r\nthe fire will entirely boil away. It is all turned into steam, and\r\nthe steam is somehow hidden away in the air, though a little of it\r\nwill be condensed into slight clouds by the colder air outside the\r\nkettle.\r\n\r\n  [7] It has lately been proved that clouds can only form in air\r\n  which contains dust, and that each little suspended particle of\r\n  water contains a speck of dust or a tiny germ of some sort for\r\n  its nucleus.\r\n\r\nBut how can water stow itself away in the air without being seen or\r\nfelt?\r\n\r\nAn illustration may help to explain this. Suppose you scatter a\r\nspoonful of small shot over a carpet or a dark-coloured table-cloth;\r\nyou would probably not be able to see them at a little distance.\r\nNow, gather them together in a heap, and you see them at once. The\r\nheap of shot in some ways resembles a drop of water, for in a drop\r\nof water the tiny particles (or molecules) of which it is composed\r\nare close together; but by heating water you cause them to fly\r\nasunder and scatter themselves in various directions. They are lost\r\nto sight, and moreover have no power of attracting each other or of\r\nacting in concert; each one then takes its own course, whereas in\r\nthe drop of water they were in some wonderful way bound together by\r\nmutual attraction. They dance in groups; but the rude force of heat\r\nwill scatter these little dancing groups, and break them up into that\r\nstate which we call a state of vapour.\r\n\r\nThe forces of heat and cohesion are directly at variance; and it\r\nis just a question of degree whether the one or the other gets the\r\nmastery in this \"tug of war.\" The more you heat the water, the faster\r\nthe little groups of molecules break up and disappear in the air.\r\nThey must in some way go moving between the particles of air, and\r\ncollisions keep taking place with inconceivable rapidity.\r\n\r\nAnd now another question arises; namely, how much water-vapour can\r\nthe air take? That depends chiefly on its temperature. Air when\r\nheated will take up a great deal of steam; and the more you heat air,\r\nthe more it can take up. When air at a given temperature can take up\r\nno more, it is said to be saturated for that temperature; but if the\r\ntemperature be raised, it will immediately begin to take up more. For\r\neach degree of temperature there is a certain amount of water-vapour\r\nwhich can be absorbed, and no more. But suppose we take some air\r\nwhich is already saturated and lower its temperature by giving it\r\na sudden chill, what will happen? It will immediately give up part\r\nof its steam, or water-vapour; namely, the exact amount which it is\r\nunable to contain at the lower temperature.[8]\r\n\r\n  [8] Pressure also has an important influence, but was omitted\r\n  above for the sake of simplicity.\r\n\r\nThere are various ways in which you can test this matter for\r\nyourself. For instance, take a hand-glass, and breathe on it. You\r\nknow what will happen: a film of moisture forms upon it; and you know\r\nthe reason why. It is simply that the cold glass gives a chill to\r\none's breath (which being warm is highly charged with water-vapour\r\nfrom the lungs), and so some of the vapour is at once condensed. Now,\r\nthis serves very well to explain how mountains catch water-vapour,\r\nand condense it. They are, as it were, a cold looking-glass; and\r\nthe hot breath of the plains, as it strikes their sides, receiving\r\na sudden chill, throws down part of the vapour it contains. On the\r\nhigher parts of mountain-ranges the cold is so great that the water\r\nassumes the form of snow.\r\n\r\nMountains, as every one knows, are colder than the plains below.\r\nNo one cares to stay very long on a mountain-top, for fear of\r\ncatching cold. It may be worth while to consider why they are cold.\r\nPerhaps you answer, \"Because they are so high.\" That is true, but\r\nnot a complete answer to our question. We must look at the matter a\r\nlittle more closely. The earth is a warm body surrounded by space in\r\nwhich the cold is inconceivably intense; but just as we protect our\r\nbodies against cold with garments, so the earth is wrapped up in an\r\natmosphere which serves more or less to keep in the heat. All warm\r\nbodies give out heat as luminous bodies give out light; but the rays\r\nof heat, unlike those of light, are quite invisible to our eyes, so\r\nthat we are unaware of them. These \"dark heat-rays,\" as they are\r\ncalled, do not make any impression on the retina, because our eyes\r\nare not capable of responding to them as they do to the ordinary rays\r\nof light. But there is a delicate little instrument known as the\r\nthermopile, which responds to, and so detects these invisible rays;\r\nand if our eyes were sensitive to such vibrations as these, we should\r\nsee heat-rays (which like light and sound are due to vibrations)\r\nstreaming from every object, just as light does from a candle-flame.\r\n\r\nThose parts of the earth which are least covered or protected by the\r\natmosphere lose heat most rapidly,--in the same way that on a frosty\r\nday one's fingers become cold unless covered up. Now, there is less\r\nair over mountains; and in those higher regions above the peaks\r\nwhat air there is, is more rarefied, and therefore less capable of\r\nstopping the heat-rays coming from the earth. Professor Tyndall has\r\nshown that water-vapour in the air has a great power of stopping dark\r\nheat-rays; and the lower regions, which contain more vapour, stop or\r\nabsorb a good deal of heat which would otherwise escape into space.\r\n\r\nLook at a map of any continent, and you will see the rivers streaming\r\naway from the mountains. All those vast quantities of water come\r\nfrom the atmosphere; and mountains do a large share of the work of\r\ncondensing it from the state of vapour to that of water. Take the\r\nmap of India, and look at the great range of the Himalayas. At\r\ntheir feet is the hot valley of the Ganges, which meets that of the\r\nBrahmapootra River. An immense amount of evaporation takes place\r\nfrom these mighty rivers, so that the air above them becomes laden\r\nwith water-vapour. Farther south is the tropical Indian Ocean, from\r\nwhich the direct rays of the sun draw up still vaster quantities of\r\nwater. And so when south winds blow over India, they are full of\r\nwater-vapour; and presently they strike the flanks of the Himalayas,\r\nand at once they are chilled, and consequently part with a large\r\namount of the vapour which they contained. This is best illustrated\r\nby the case of the southwest monsoon wind of the summer season, which\r\nsets in during the month of April, and continues to blow steadily\r\ntowards the northeast till October. After leaving the Bay of Bengal,\r\nthis warm wind, laden with vapour, meets ere long with the range\r\nknown as the Khasi Hills, and consequently throws down a large part\r\nof its vapour in the form of rain. The rainfall here in the summer\r\nseason reaches the prodigious total of five hundred inches, or about\r\ntwenty times as much as falls in London during a whole year. After\r\npassing over these hills, the monsoon wind presently reaches the\r\nHimalayas; and another downpour then takes place, until by the time\r\nit reaches the wide plains of Thibet, so much water has been given up\r\nthat it becomes a very dry wind instead of a moist one.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that the condensation effected by\r\nmountains is entirely due to this coldness. They have another simple\r\nand effective way of compelling the winds to give up rain: their\r\nsloping sides force the winds which strike them to ascend into higher\r\nregions,--wedging them up as waves run up a sloping stony bank on the\r\nseashore,--and when the winds reach higher regions of the atmosphere\r\nthey must (as explained above) suffer loss of heat, or in other\r\nwords, have their temperature lowered. They also expand considerably\r\nas they rise into regions where the atmospheric pressure is less;\r\nand as every gas or vapour loses heat in the act of expansion, they\r\nundergo a further cooling from this cause also.\r\n\r\nWe have now learned that the cooling process is brought about in\r\nthree different ways: (1) By contact with the cold body of the\r\nmountains; (2) By giving out heat into space; (3) By expansion of\r\nthe air as it reaches into the higher regions of the atmosphere.\r\nThe \"cloud-caps\" on certain mountains and promontories are to be\r\nexplained by all these causes combined.\r\n\r\nThe west coast of Great Britain illustrates the same thing on a\r\nsmaller scale. There the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, travelling\r\nin a northeasterly direction straight away from the Gulf of Mexico,\r\nstrike the west coast of Ireland, England, and Scotland; and as most\r\npeople are aware, the mild climate of Great Britain is chiefly due\r\nto this fact. If you contrast for a moment the east and west coasts\r\nof Britain, you will see that the latter is much more rocky and\r\nmountainous than the east coast. Mountains run down nearly all our\r\nwestern coasts. Now, it is this elevated and rocky side of Britain\r\nwhich catches most of the rain. Very instructive it is to compare the\r\nannual rainfall in different parts of Britain. On Dartmoor about 86\r\ninches of rain fall every year, while in London only about 24 inches\r\nfall annually; but then London has no range of mountains near, and is\r\nfar away from the west coast. Again, while people in Ambleside have\r\nto put up with 78 inches of rain, in Norfolk they are content with\r\nthe modest allowance of 24 inches or so. At a place called Quoich on\r\nthe west coast of Scotland, about 117 inches fall every year. These\r\ndifferences are chiefly due to the different contour of the land down\r\nthe west side of Britain, which is mountainous, while the east side\r\nis flat, and also to the fact that while easterly winds, which have\r\ncome over the continent, are dry, our prevailing winds are from the\r\nwest and southwest, and are consequently heavily laden with vapour\r\nfrom the Atlantic Ocean. These winds follow the direction of the Gulf\r\nStream, driving it along before them; and in so doing they take up\r\nlarge quantities of vapour from its surface. When these warm winds\r\ntouch our western coasts, they receive a chill, and consequently are\r\nno longer able to contain all the vapour which they bring with them,\r\nand so down comes the rain.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Mountains are elevated reservoirs of water in one form or\r\nanother, and thus not only feed the streams and rivers, but give them\r\nforce and direction as well._ It is very important that the mountains\r\nshould not allow the waters they collect to run away too fast. Try\r\nto think for a moment what would happen if instead of being, as it\r\nwere, locked up in the form of snowfields and glaciers, the water\r\nwere all in the liquid form. It would soon run away, and for months\r\ntogether the great river-valleys would be dry and desolate. When the\r\nrain came, there would be tremendous floods; dire destruction would\r\nbe wrought in the valleys; and very soon the great rivers would\r\ndwindle down to nothing. Vegetation too would suffer seriously for\r\nwant of water during the summer months; and the valleys generally\r\nwould cease to be the fertile sources of life which they are at\r\npresent. The earth would become for the most part like a stagnant\r\nmarsh.\r\n\r\nBut in the higher mountain regions there is a beneficent process\r\ngoing on which averts such an evil. The precious supplies of water\r\nare stored up in the solid forms of snow and ice. Now, we all know\r\nthat snow and ice take a long time to melt; and thus Nature regulates\r\nand like a prudent housewife economises her precious stores. The\r\nrivers which she feeds continually, from silent snowfields and\r\nglaciers among her mountain-peaks, are the very arteries and veins\r\nof the earth; and as the blood in our bodies is forced to circulate\r\nby pressure from the heart, so the rivers are compelled to flow by\r\npressure from the great heart of the hills,--slow, steady, continuous\r\npressure, not the quick pulses which the human heart sends through\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nAnd again, as the blood, after circulating through the body in an\r\ninfinite number of life-giving streams, returns to the heart once\r\nmore on its journey, so the thousand streams which wander over the\r\nplains find their way back to the heart of the mountains, for the\r\nwater is brought there in the form of vapour and clouds by the winds.\r\n\r\nWhen we build water-towers, and make reservoirs on high ground to\r\ngive pressure to the water in our pipes, and make it circulate\r\neverywhere,--even to the tops of our houses,--we are only taking a\r\nhint from Nature. The mountains are her water-towers, and from these\r\nstrong reservoirs, which never burst, she commands her streams,\r\nforcing them along their courses in order that they may find their\r\nway to the utmost bounds of continents.\r\n\r\nBut there is another way in which mountains regulate the supply\r\nof water, and prevent it from running away too fast,--one not so\r\neffective as the freezing process, but still very useful, because it\r\napplies to the lower hills below the line of perpetual snow. This may\r\nbe well illustrated by the state of some of the Scotch hills in the\r\nmiddle of summer or autumn, when there is little if any snow resting\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nAny one familiar with these hills will have noticed how full of\r\nwater their sides are. Tiny threads of streams trickle slowly along\r\neverywhere; peat-beds are saturated with dark-brown water; even the\r\ngrass and soil are generally more or less wet, especially under pine\r\nforests. One can generally get a cup of water somewhere, except\r\nafter a long dry summer, which is exceptional. Then there is the dew\r\nforming every night. Forests with their undergrowth of soil--moss\r\nand fern--also help very considerably to check the flow of water. We\r\nhave often asked ourselves when watching some swift-flowing river,\r\n\"Where does all this water come from? Why does it not dry up in\r\nhot weather?\" The answer came fully after we had climbed several\r\nmountains, and seen with our eyes the peat-beds among the hills, and\r\nheard the trickling of the tiny rivulets hurrying along to feed\r\nsome neighbouring burn, or perhaps to run into some mountain tarn or\r\nloch, and noticed the damp, spongy state of the soil everywhere,--not\r\nto mention the little springs which here and there well up to the\r\nsurface, and so contribute their share.\r\n\r\nThe rivers and streams of Scotland assume various tints of amber\r\nand dark-brown, according to the amount of rain which has recently\r\nfallen. These colours are due to organic matter from the peat.\r\nCompare Scott's description of the Greta:--\r\n\r\n    \"In yellow light her currents shone,\r\n    Matching in hue the favourite gem\r\n    Of Albion's mountain diadem.\"\r\n\r\nThe waters of some Scotch rivers after heavy rain look as black as\r\npitch.\r\n\r\nNor must we omit the lakes which abound in most mountain regions,\r\nand serve as natural reservoirs for the rivers, besides giving a\r\nwonderful charm to mountain scenery.\r\n\r\nThe largest lakes in mountainous regions are found on the courses\r\nof the rivers; and there is good reason to believe that they were\r\nformed, not by any process of subsidence, but by the same operations\r\nthat carved out the valleys. In many cases they are due to the\r\ndamming up of a stream. But in some countries the streams dry up\r\nduring summer,--in Palestine or Sinai, where there is but little soil\r\non the hills, and consequently hardly any vegetation. Such barren\r\nhills cannot hold the continual supplies which pour gently forth from\r\nthe mountains of higher latitudes.\r\n\r\nThe Alps feed four of the principal rivers of Europe. We cannot do\r\nbetter than quote Professor Bonney, whose writings on the Alps are\r\nfamiliar to all geologists. In his \"Alpine Regions of Switzerland\"\r\nthe following passage occurs:--\r\n\r\n   \"This mass of mountains, the great highlands of Europe, is\r\n   therefore of the utmost physical and geographical importance.\r\n   Rising in places to a height of more than fifteen thousand\r\n   feet above the sea, and covered for an extent of many thousand\r\n   square miles with perpetual snow, it is the chief feeder of\r\n   four of the principal rivers in Europe,--the Po, the Rhone,\r\n   the Rhine, and the Danube. But for those barren fields of ice,\r\n   high up among the silent crags, the seeming home of winter and\r\n   death, these great arteries of life would every summer dwindle\r\n   down to paltry streams, feebly wandering over stone-strewn\r\n   beds. Stand, for example, on some mountain-spur, and look down\r\n   on the Lombardy plain, all one rich carpet of wheat and maize,\r\n   of rice and vine; the life of those myriad threads of green\r\n   and gold is fed from these icy peaks, which stand out against\r\n   the northern sky in such strange and solemn contrast. As it is\r\n   with the Po, so it is with the Rhine and the Rhone, both of\r\n   which issue from the Alps as broad, swelling streams; so, too,\r\n   with the Danube, which, although it does not rise in them, yet\r\n   receives from the Inn and the Drave almost all the drainage of\r\n   the eastern districts.\"\r\n\r\nA very little reflection will serve to convince any one how vastly\r\nimportant and beneficial is the slope of the mountains, and how it\r\ngives force and direction to streams and rivers. Without this force,\r\ndue to universal gravitation, by which the waters seek continually\r\nlower levels, the supplies in the hills would be useless. Mere lakes\r\non flat surfaces would not answer the purpose; and so the sources of\r\nwater are elevated in order that it may pour over the world below.\r\n\r\nNo writer has given such fascinating descriptions of mountains as\r\nMr. Ruskin; and no one has more eloquently described the functions\r\nthey perform. In the fourth volume of his \"Modern Painters,\" which\r\nevery one who cares for mountains should read, we find the following\r\nbeautiful passage:--\r\n\r\n   \"Every fountain and river, from the inch-deep streamlet that\r\n   crosses the village lane in trembling clearness, to the massy\r\n   and silent march of the everlasting multitude of waters in\r\n   Amazon or Ganges, owe their play and purity and power to the\r\n   ordained elevations of the earth. Gentle or steep, extended\r\n   or abrupt, some determined slope of the earth's surface is of\r\n   course necessary before any wave can so much as overtake one\r\n   sedge in its pilgrimage; and how seldom do we enough consider,\r\n   as we walk beside the margins of our pleasant brooks, how\r\n   beautiful and wonderful is that ordinance, of which every\r\n   blade of grass that waves in their clear waters is a perpetual\r\n   sign,--that the dew and rain fallen on the face of the earth\r\n   shall find no resting-place; shall find, on the contrary,\r\n   fixed channels traced for them from the ravines of the central\r\n   crests down which they roar in sudden ranks of foam to the dark\r\n   hollows beneath the banks of lowland pasture, round which they\r\n   must circle slowly among the stems and beneath the leaves of\r\n   the lilies; paths prepared for them by which, at some appointed\r\n   rate of journey, they must evermore descend, sometimes slow,\r\n   and sometimes swift, but never pausing; the daily portion of\r\n   the earth they have to glide over marked for them at each\r\n   successive sunrise; the place which has known them knowing\r\n   them no more; and the gateways of guarding mountains opened for\r\n   them in cleft and chasm, none letting them in their pilgrimage,\r\n   and from afar off the great heart of the sea calling them to\r\n   itself: 'Deep calleth unto deep.'\"\r\n\r\nGeologists, however, do not in these days teach that the present\r\npaths of rivers were made for them, but rather that the rivers have\r\ncarved out their own valleys for themselves. The old teaching before\r\nthe days of Lyell and Hutton, the founders of modern geology, was\r\nthat valleys were rents in the rocks of the earth's crust formed\r\nby some wonderful convulsion of Nature, whereby they were cracked,\r\ntorn asunder, and upheaved. But a careful study of rivers and their\r\nvalleys for many years has shown that there is no evidence of such\r\nsudden convulsions. The world is very old indeed, and rivers have\r\nbeen flowing much as we see them for ages and ages. A few thousand\r\nyears is to the geologist but a short space of time; and there can be\r\nno doubt that a stream can in the course of time carve out for itself\r\na valley. The operations of Nature seem slow to us because our lives\r\nare so short, and we can see so little change even in a generation;\r\nbut the effects of these changes mount up enormously when continued\r\nthrough a long space of time. Nature works slowly; but then she has\r\nunlimited time, and never seems in a hurry. It is like the old story\r\nof the hare and the tortoise; and the river, working on steadily and\r\nquietly for hundreds or thousands of years, accomplishes far more in\r\nthe end than sudden floods or violent catastrophes of any sort.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Mountains suffer themselves to be slowly worn away in order\r\nthat the face of the earth may be renewed; in other words, they die\r\nthat we, and all created things, may live._ The reader will find a\r\nfull account of the methods by which these results are accomplished\r\nin chapters v. and vii., and therefore we must not anticipate this\r\npart of the subject. Let it suffice for the present to say that\r\nthis destruction of the hills is brought about by the action of\r\nheat and cold, of rain and frost, of snow and ice, and the thousand\r\nstreams that flow down the mountain-sides. It is with soils that we\r\nare chiefly concerned at present. Try to think for a moment of the\r\nliterally _vital_ consequences which follow from the presence of\r\ngood rich soils over different parts of the earth, and ask whether\r\nit would be possible for civilised races of men to flourish and\r\nmultiply as they do if it were not for the great fertile valleys and\r\nplains of the world. Mountain races are neither rich nor powerful.\r\nMan exists mainly by cultivation of the soil; and among mountains\r\nwe only find here and there patches that are worthy of the labour\r\nand expenditure of capital involved in cultivation. But in the great\r\nplains, in the principal river-valleys of the world, and among the\r\nlesser hill-ranges it is different. The _lowlands_ are the fertile\r\nregions. All great and powerful nations of the world are children\r\nof the plains. It was so in the past; it will be so in the future,\r\nunless men learn to feed on something else than corn, milk, and\r\nflesh, which is not very likely.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians, the earliest civilised race of which we have\r\nsatisfactory records, dwelt in the fertile valley and delta of\r\nthe Nile. They clearly perceived the value of this great river to\r\nthemselves, and worshipped it accordingly. They knew nothing of its\r\nsource in the far-away lakes of Central Africa; but they knew truly,\r\nas Herodotus tells us, that Egypt was \"the gift of the Nile,\" for the\r\nalluvial soil of its delta has been formed by the yearly floods of\r\nthat great river, as its waters, laden with a fine rich mud, spread\r\nover its banks, and for a time filled the valley with one sheet of\r\nwater. The Assyrians and Babylonians had their home in the valley of\r\nthe Euphrates and Tigris. The Chinese, too, have their great rivers.\r\nRussia is well watered by powerful rivers. The most populous parts of\r\nthe United States of America are watered by the great Mississippi,\r\nand the other rivers which flow into it. England, Germany, and France\r\nare furnished with well-watered plains.\r\n\r\nSoils are the chief form of national wealth. Minerals, such as coal\r\nand iron, are of course extremely valuable, and help to make an\r\nindustrious race rich; but the land is the main thing, after all, and\r\nby land we mean soil. The two words are almost synonymous. But since\r\nthe soil is formed chiefly of débris brought from the mountains, it\r\nwould be more true to say that these are the real sources of wealth.\r\nSoils contain besides a large amount of valuable organic matter (that\r\nis, decayed matter which has once had animal or vegetable life)\r\ndifferent kinds of minerals, which are necessary to the support of\r\nplant life: potash, soda, carbonate of lime, silica, magnesia, iron,\r\nphosphorus, and manganese in their various compounds are all present\r\nin the rocks of which mountains are composed. We must again fall back\r\nupon \"Modern Painters\" for an effective description of the forming of\r\nsoil by destruction of the hills:--\r\n\r\n   \"The higher mountains suffer their summits to be broken into\r\n   fragments and to be cast down in sheets of massy rock, full, as\r\n   we shall presently see, of every substance necessary for the\r\n   nourishment of plants; these fallen fragments are again broken\r\n   by frost, and ground by torrents into various conditions of\r\n   sand and clay,--materials which are distributed perpetually by\r\n   the streams farther and farther from the mountain's base. Every\r\n   shower that swells the rivulets enables their waters to carry\r\n   certain portions of earth into new positions, and exposes new\r\n   banks of ground to be moved in their turn.... The process is\r\n   continued more gently, but not less effectively, over all the\r\n   surface of the lower undulating country; and each filtering\r\n   thread of summer rain which trickles through the short turf of\r\n   the uplands is bearing its own appointed burden of earth down\r\n   on some new natural garden in the dingles beneath.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be laid down as a simple economic truth, that no nation can be\r\npowerful, rich, or prosperous, unless it possess in the first place\r\na good soil. Other conditions, such as large navigable rivers, a\r\ngood seaboard for harbouring ships, are also important; but unless\r\nthe land will yield plenty of food, the population cannot be very\r\ngreat, for people must be fed. Foreign supplies of corn at a low\r\nprice, meat and provisions of various kinds, supplement what is\r\ngrown in England; but without a good soil we could not have become a\r\npowerful nation.\r\n\r\nA high state of civilisation is in a large measure to be traced to\r\nclimate and soil. The sequence is somewhat as follows:--\r\n\r\nMountains collect rain.\r\n\r\nRain fills the rivers.\r\n\r\nRivers make rich alluvial plains.\r\n\r\nAgriculture follows; and food is produced.\r\n\r\nAbundant food maintains a large population.\r\n\r\nThe population works to supply its various wants; such as roads,\r\nrailways, ships, houses, machinery, etc. Then follows exchange with\r\nother countries. They send us what they can best produce, and we send\r\nthem what we can best and most easily produce, and so both parties\r\ngain.\r\n\r\nThus towns spring up. Education, refinement, learning, and the higher\r\narts follow from the active life of towns, where more brain-work is\r\nrequired, and the standard of life is higher.\r\n\r\nAnd thus we may, in imagination, follow step by step the various\r\nstages by which the highest phases of civilisation are brought to\r\npass, beginning at the mountains and ending with human beings of\r\nthe highest type,--the philosopher, artist, poet, or statesman, not\r\nomitting the gentler sex, who are often said to rule the world.\r\n\r\nThe following lines of Milton possess, in the light of these facts, a\r\ndeeper meaning than the poet probably intended to convey:--\r\n\r\n    \"Straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures\r\n    Whilst the landscape round it measures:\r\n    Russet lawns and fallows grey,\r\n    Where the nibbling flocks do stray;\r\n    Mountains on whose barren breast\r\n    The labouring clouds do often rest;\r\n    Meadows trim with daisies pied,\r\n    Shallow brooks and rivers wide;\r\n    Flowers and battlements it sees\r\n    Bosomed high in tufted trees,--\r\n    Where perhaps some beauty lies,\r\n    The cynosure of neighbouring eyes.\"\r\n\r\nWith a little rearrangement of the lines, the sequence we have\r\nindicated above would be well illustrated. The mountains must come\r\nfirst; then the clouds, ready to bring forth their rain; then the\r\nbrooks and rivers, then \"russet lawns and fallows grey,\"--with their\r\n\"nibbling flocks.\" Then come the human elements in the scene,--the\r\n\"towers and battlements,\" containing armed warriors, well fed, no\r\ndoubt, and ready to do their master's bidding; lastly, the lady\r\nwho adorns the home of her lord, and, let us hope, makes it worth\r\nfighting for.\r\n\r\nFor commercial purposes, large navigable rivers are of great use. And\r\nin spite of the modern railway, rivers still exert an influence in\r\ndetermining the routes followed by trade. London, Liverpool, Glasgow,\r\nand other busy centres of life owe their importance to the rivers\r\nwhich flow through them, especially since they are tidal rivers.\r\nHeavily laden barges may be seen from London Bridge going up and down\r\nwith the tide every day.\r\n\r\nSince the direction as well as the existence of large rivers is\r\nregulated by mountains, it is clear that mountains have a very direct\r\ninfluence on the trade of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mountains supply many of our wants._ Besides water and soil, how\r\nmany useful things come from the hills! Their slopes, watered by\r\nthe clouds, frequently support an abundant growth of pine forest;\r\nand thus we get wood for the shipwright and joiner. Again, mountains\r\nare composed of harder rocks than we find in the plains, and that\r\nis one reason why they stand out high above the rest of the world.\r\nTheir substance has been hardened to withstand for a longer time the\r\ndestruction to which all rocks are subjected. They have been greatly\r\ncompressed and generally more or less hardened by subterranean heat.\r\nWe bake clay and make it into hard bricks; so Nature has baked and\r\notherwise hardened the once soft strata of which mountains are\r\nchiefly composed, converting them into slates, schist, gneiss, and\r\nother kinds of rock called \"metamorphic\" by geologists, because they\r\nhave been altered or metamorphosed from their original condition (see\r\nchapter viii., page 277). Again, granite, basalt, and other rocks\r\nknown as \"igneous,\" which once existed in a molten condition, have\r\nforced their way up from subterranean regions into the rocks forming\r\nmountain-chains; and a good deal of the hardening just alluded to is\r\ndue to the presence of these fiery intruders, which have baked and\r\nhardened the rocks around them to a considerable extent, altering\r\nat the same time their mineral composition. The same causes which\r\nled to the injection of granite, basalt, and other igneous rocks in\r\nmountain-ranges brought other consequences in their train. Whatever\r\nthe causes, they were closely connected with volcanic eruptions, so\r\nthat highly heated water and steam found their way through cracks and\r\nother fissures in the rocks; and in the course of time the chemical\r\nactions thus set up led to the deposition of valuable metallic ores\r\nwithin these fissures. In this way mineral veins were formed; and\r\nvolcanic action seems to be largely responsible for the production of\r\nminerals. Thus we find around Vesuvius, and in fact in all volcanic\r\nregions, large and varied supplies of minerals. Now, the geologist\r\ndiscovers that many mountain-chains--such, for example, as the\r\nGrampians, Alps, and Carpathians--have in past geological periods\r\nbeen the seats of volcanic action on a grand scale; and so we need\r\nnot be surprised to learn that mountainous countries yield large\r\nsupplies of valuable gems and metallic ores (see chapter viii.,\r\npage 277). Even in the days of Solomon, the active and business-like\r\nPhoenicians were carrying on trade with Great Britain; and the tin\r\ncame from Cornwall. Besides tin, gold, silver, lead, copper, zinc,\r\nand other metals come from our hills. Now, however, we get our copper\r\nmostly from the Andes, and our gold from Australia or South Africa,\r\nbecause it can be got more cheaply from these countries, to which\r\nmany of our Cornish miners have emigrated.\r\n\r\nPrecious stones also come chiefly from the hills, for the same\r\nreason; for they were formed at the same time and by the same causes.\r\nCairngorms, agates, chalcedony, jasper, onyx, topaz, diamonds, and\r\nmany other gems are silent but certain witnesses to the action of\r\nsubterranean heat, acting long ago on the rocks which we now see\r\nstanding up high above the general surface of the ground, though\r\nonce they were buried deep down below the surface. Diamonds as well\r\nas gold are often got from the beds of streams, but this is easily\r\naccounted for; the streams have washed them out and brought them down\r\nfrom the hills.\r\n\r\nThe following words from the Book of Job (xxviii. 5) might well be\r\napplied to the hills.\r\n\r\n    \"As for the earth, out of it cometh bread:\r\n    And underneath it is turned up as it were by fire.\r\n    The stones thereof are the place of sapphires,\r\n    And it hath dust of gold.\"\r\n\r\nWe have thus explained the three principal services rendered by\r\nmountains, but some others remain to be mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mountains have an important influence on climate._ The climate of\r\nhighlands everywhere has certain peculiarities which distinguish\r\nit from that of adjacent lowlands. The air resting on mountains is\r\nless dense than that of the lowlands, and hence has fewer molecules\r\nto obstruct the entering sunbeams by day, or to stop the outward\r\nradiation at night. Therefore mountain air must be cooler; and so we\r\nfind that on mountains the mean, or average, annual temperature is\r\nlower. This rarity of the air causes the ground to become hotter by\r\nday and colder by night than the ground of the plains; and so the\r\nextremes of temperature are greater. These extremes are injurious to\r\nvegetation in the higher regions, and the want of moisture still\r\nmore so. But mountain-slopes _up to a certain height_ usually have\r\na moist climate; that is, they have more clouds and rain than the\r\nsurrounding lowlands. Below the region of snow there is generally\r\na heavy growth of forest; and forests in their turn exercise an\r\nimportant influence, helping to collect moisture, and in various ways\r\nto prevent extremes either of heat or cold.\r\n\r\nThe earth is divided into three well-marked zones or belts of\r\nclimate: (1) The torrid zone within the tropics, where the sun is\r\nvertical twice a year, and days and nights are nearly equal; (2)\r\nThe temperate zones, where the sun's rays come more obliquely,\r\nand so are less powerful, and where the length of day and night\r\nvaries considerably; and (3) The frigid zones, round each of the\r\npoles, regions of intense cold, where for six months of the year\r\nthe sun is never seen. Now, these broad divisions, so familiar to\r\nschool children, are considerably interfered with by the height of\r\nvarious districts above the sea-level, or, as geographers say, by\r\naltitude. High ranges of mountains bring somewhat arctic conditions\r\nwith them, even in low latitudes, where one would expect great\r\nheat. Thus the climate of the plains is very different from that\r\nof their neighbouring mountain-ranges, although their latitudes are\r\npractically the same. Travellers in Switzerland know how hot it can\r\nbe in the Rhone Valley or in the plain of Lombardy, and how much\r\ncooler it is when you get up among the glaciers and the snowfields.\r\nOr to take an illustration from Great Britain: a hot summer would be\r\nsomewhat trying in Edinburgh, Glasgow, or even Inverness, because\r\nthey lie low, while among the Grampians, on Speyside, or Braemar, it\r\nwould be very pleasant.\r\n\r\nVegetation follows climate. The sultry plains of the Ganges show\r\na luxuriant tropical vegetation, while on the middle slopes of\r\nthe Himalayas the climate is temperate, like that of Europe, and\r\nconsequently the vegetation resembles that of a temperate region; and\r\nthe highest parts of this great range are like polar latitudes in\r\ntheir climate, and partly also in their vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe arctic character of the climate of high mountain regions shows\r\nitself in the flora; for on the High Alps and the Highlands of\r\nScotland and Norway, we find no small number of truly arctic plants\r\nwhose home is much farther north. A very long time ago, when the\r\nclimate of the whole of Northern Europe was extremely severe, and\r\nwhen great glaciers descended from the mountains into the plains,\r\nso that the aspect of the country was somewhat similar to that of\r\nGreenland at the present day, arctic plants and animals came down\r\nfrom their northern home, and flourished abundantly. This was during\r\nthe _Great Ice Age_, which has left behind unmistakable evidences\r\nwhich the geologist can interpret as if they were written records.\r\nThen for some reason the climate became milder, the glaciers melted\r\naway, in Great Britain at least; but these arctic plants were left\r\nbehind, and flourished still on the cool mountains, though they died\r\nout on the warm plains (see chap. iv., pp. 123-124).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SNOW ON THE HIGH ALPS. FROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY MR.\r\n  DONKIN.]\r\n\r\n_Mountains help to cause movement and change in the atmosphere._\r\nLet us see how this takes place. Mountains expose on one side their\r\nmasses of rock to the full heat of the sun. Rocks are capable of\r\nbecoming highly heated under a blazing sun: we have known stone\r\nwalls, even in England, to be almost too hot to touch; and perhaps\r\nthe reader may have often noticed the quivering of the hot air as\r\nit rises from the ground on a summer day, especially over a road or\r\nany piece of bare rocky ground. This quivering tells us that the air\r\nis highly heated by the ground beneath, and is consequently rising.\r\nYou know how the pebbles look beneath a clear running stream; and\r\nthe things which we see through air in this state all seem to be\r\nsimilarly moving or quivering. It is easy then to imagine how masses\r\nof heated air would rise up from the side of a mountain-range which\r\nfaces the sun,--that is, the southern side,--while on the other, or\r\nnorthern side they cast a soft shadow for leagues over the plains\r\nat their feet. In this way mountains divide a district into two\r\ndifferent climates, with a light warm air on their southern slopes,\r\nand colder air on the northern, and the rising of the warm air will\r\ncause a certain amount of circulation and movement. Hence mountains\r\nhelp to make currents in the atmosphere, and these currents produce\r\nimportant consequences.\r\n\r\nWhen mountain-ranges trend more or less directly across the direction\r\nof prevailing winds, they always have a moist side and a dry one. In\r\nthe torrid zone, where easterly winds prevail, the eastern slope is\r\nusually the moist side; but in higher latitudes, as, for example, in\r\nEurope, the western side of mountain-ranges receives the greatest\r\namount of rainfall, because westerly winds prevail there.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mountains are barriers dividing not only one nation from another,\r\nbut separating also various tribes of plants and animals._ It will\r\nbe readily understood that with the exception of birds, whose powers\r\nof flight render them independent of physical barriers, most animals\r\nfind mountains more impassable than men do. We can make roads and\r\nrailways, but they cannot thus aid their powers of locomotion; hence\r\nmountains put limits to their migrations. Still, climate and food\r\nsupplies have a greater influence in determining the boundaries of\r\nzoölogical provinces (see chapter iv.).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mountains are the backbones of continents._ A glance at a map of\r\nthe world will show that there is evidently a close connection\r\nbetween continents and great mountain-chains. This connection shows\r\nitself both in the shapes and general direction of continents.\r\nThus, the long continuous line of mountain-chain which extends from\r\nthe southern spur of the Andes to the northern end of the Rocky\r\nMountains,--a distance of about nine thousand miles,--corresponds\r\nwith the general trend of the North American continent, and forms\r\nthe axis or backbone of that vast tract of land. It seems as if the\r\nsea on its western side were kept at bay by this great rocky wall,\r\nwhile on its eastern side the rivers have formed new land. A line of\r\nmountains is often the coast line, for the sea cannot overcome it\r\nunless subsidence takes place. The backbone of Asia and Europe runs\r\neast and west, and the continental area of the Old World follows the\r\nsame general direction.\r\n\r\nThese are the chief uses of mountains, and the facts which we have\r\nbrought forward will serve to show how indispensable they are. The\r\nfollowing eloquent passage from \"Modern Painters\" may form a fitting\r\nclose to the present chapter:--\r\n\r\n   \"And thus those desolate and threatening ranges which in nearly\r\n   all ages of the world men have looked upon with aversion or\r\n   with horror, and shrunk back from as if they were haunted by\r\n   perpetual images of death, are in reality sources of life\r\n   and happiness, far fuller and more beneficent than all the\r\n   bright fruitfulness of the plain. The valleys only feed; the\r\n   mountains feed and guard and strengthen us. We take our ideas\r\n   of fearfulness and sublimity alternately from the mountains and\r\n   the sea; but we associate them unjustly. The sea-wave, with\r\n   all its beneficence, is yet devouring and terrible; but the\r\n   silent wave of the blue mountain is lifted towards heaven in a\r\n   stillness of perpetual mercy; and the one surge, unfathomable\r\n   in its darkness, the other unshaken in its faithfulness, for\r\n   ever bear the seal of their appointed symbolism:--\r\n\r\n    \"'Thy _righteousness_ is like the great mountains,\r\n    Thy _judgements_ are a great deep.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSUNSHINE AND STORM ON THE MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n    I would entreat your company\r\n    To see the wonders of the world.\r\n\r\n    _Two Gentlemen of Verona._\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The spirit of the hills is action, that of the lowlands repose.\"[9]\r\nThe plains, with their peaceful meadows and meandering streams, might\r\nalmost be said to be asleep; but the mountains are wide awake. They\r\nare emphatically scenes of violent or rapid action. The wind blows\r\nmore fiercely among the mountain-peaks than over the plains below;\r\nheat and cold are more extreme; and every process of change or decay\r\nseems quickened.\r\n\r\n  [9] Ruskin, \"Modern Painters.\"\r\n\r\nAvalanches, falls of rock, earthquakes, storms, and floods exhibit\r\nthe more terrible aspects of the hills. Yet they have their gentler\r\nmoods: witness the brightness of the starry sky overhead, and its\r\nintense blue by day, the wonderful sunrises and sunsets, the lovely\r\neffects of light and shade, of cloud and mist, the stillness and\r\nsilence of the eternal snows in summer, and the beauty of the Alpine\r\nflower.\r\n\r\nLet us see what those who know mountains best have to say about the\r\nwonderful things they have seen there. To begin with sunset and\r\nsunrise. Professor Bonney remarks,--\r\n\r\n   \"Not the least interesting peculiarity of an Alpine sunset\r\n   is the frequency with which its most beautiful effects are\r\n   revealed quite unexpectedly. Often at the close of a rainy\r\n   afternoon, the clouds, just before the sun goes down, break,\r\n   roll up, sometimes disperse as if by magic, in the glory of\r\n   those crimson rays that come darting upon them and piercing\r\n   every rift. Many a time have I watched the vapours around a\r\n   mountain-peak curling lightly upwards, and melting away into\r\n   the sky, till at last the unclouded summit glowed with flushes\r\n   of orange and rose, ere it grew pale and dead in its shroud of\r\n   fresh-fallen snow.\"[10]\r\n\r\n  [10] The Alpine Regions of Switzerland.\r\n\r\nHere is a description by Professor Tyndall of a sunset witnessed in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the Weisshorn:--\r\n\r\n   \"As the day approached its end, the scene assumed the most\r\n   sublime aspect. All the lower portions of the mountains were\r\n   deeply shaded, while the loftiest peaks, ranged upon a\r\n   semicircle, were fully exposed to the sinking sun. They seemed\r\n   pyramids of solid fire; while here and there long stretches\r\n   of crimson light drawn over the higher snowfields linked the\r\n   glorified summits together. An intensely illuminated geranium\r\n   flower seems to swim in its own colour, which apparently\r\n   surrounds the petals like a layer, and defeats by its lustre\r\n   any attempt of the eye to seize upon the sharp outline of the\r\n   leaves. A similar effect has been observed upon the mountains;\r\n   the glory did not seem to come from them alone, but seemed also\r\n   effluent from the air around them. This gave them a certain\r\n   buoyancy which suggested entire detachment from the earth.\r\n   They swam in splendour which intoxicated the soul; and I will\r\n   not now repeat in my moments of soberness the extravagant\r\n   analogies which ran through my brain. As the evening advanced,\r\n   the eastern heavens low down assumed a deep purple hue, above\r\n   which, and blended with it by infinitesimal gradations, was a\r\n   belt of red, and over this again zones of orange and violet. I\r\n   walked round the corner of the mountain at sunset, and found\r\n   the western sky glowing with a more transparent crimson than\r\n   that which overspread the east. The crown of the Weisshorn was\r\n   embedded in this magnificent light. After sunset the purple\r\n   of the east changed to a deep neutral tint; and against the\r\n   faded red which spread above it, the sun-forsaken mountains\r\n   laid their cold and ghostly heads. The ruddy colour vanished\r\n   more and more; the stars strengthened in lustre, until finally\r\n   the moon and they held undisputed possession of the blue-grey\r\n   sky.\"[11]\r\n\r\n  [11] Mountaineering in 1861 (Longman).\r\n\r\n\r\nMarvellous sunsets are to be witnessed from the mountains of the New\r\nWorld. The following is a short and graphic description of sunset\r\nglories on the Sierra Nevada Mountains by Mr. Clarence King, whose\r\nname is well known to geologists:--\r\n\r\n   \"While I looked, the sun descended, shadows climbed the\r\n   Sierras, casting a gloom over foothill and pine, until at last\r\n   only the snow summits, reflecting the evening light, glowed\r\n   like red lamps along the mountain-wall for hundreds of miles.\r\n   The rest of the Sierra became invisible. The snow burned for a\r\n   moment in the violet sky, and at last went out.\"\r\n\r\nThese marvellous effects appeal powerfully to our sense of beauty\r\nand produce in most minds feelings of intense delight; but they also\r\nappeal to the reasoning faculty in man, and an intelligent observer\r\nnaturally inquires, \"Why are these things so? How are those glorious\r\ncolours of crimson, orange, and yellow produced?\" A full explanation\r\ncannot be attempted here; but this much may perhaps be said without\r\ntiring the patience of the reader. White light, such as sunlight or\r\nthe light from an electric arc, is composed of all the colours of the\r\nrainbow,--violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red. A ray\r\nof sunlight on passing through a prism is split up into all these\r\ncolours in the above order, and we get them arranged in a band which\r\nis known as the spectrum. Thus it is proved that white light is made\r\nup of all colours (black is not a colour, but the absence of colour).\r\nNow, when the sun is low down in the sky, as at sunset, only some of\r\nthese colour-rays are able to pass through the atmosphere and so to\r\nreach our eyes, while others are stopped in passing through very many\r\nmiles of atmosphere (as they must obviously do when the sun is low).\r\nThose which are stopped are the blue rays and others allied to blue,\r\nsuch as purple and green; but the red and yellow rays are able to\r\npass on till they come to us. Hence red, yellow, and orange are the\r\nprevailing sunset tints.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, becomes of the missing blue rays? They are caught by the\r\nmyriads of little floating particles in the air, and reflected away\r\nfrom us. That is why we do not see them; their course is turned\r\nback, just as waves breaking against a stone sea-wall are turned\r\nback or reflected. A person situated _behind_ such a wall will not\r\nsee the waves which break against it; but suppose a _very_ big wave\r\ncame: it would come right over, and then we should soon become aware\r\nof its presence. So it is with the little waves of light: some are\r\nstopped and turned back as they break against the myriads of little\r\ndust particles and the still more numerous particles of mist always\r\nfloating in the air; while others, which are larger, break over\r\nthem and travel on undisturbed until they reach our eyes. Now, the\r\nlarger waves of light are the red waves, while the smaller ones are\r\nthe blue waves; hence there is no difficulty in understanding why\r\nthe red waves (or vibrations) are seen at sunset and sunrise, to\r\nthe exclusion of the blue waves. But it must be borne in mind that\r\nlight-waves are of infinitesimal smallness, thousands and thousands\r\nof them going to make up an inch. Sound also travels in waves, and\r\nthe phenomena of sound serve to illustrate those of light; but\r\nsound-waves are very much larger.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the sky overhead appears blue is that we see the blue\r\nrays reflected down to the earth from myriads of tiny dust and water\r\nparticles, while the red rays pass on over our heads, which is just\r\nthe reverse of what happens at sunset.\r\n\r\nOn the southern slopes of the Alps the blues of the sky are generally\r\nvery different from those on the northern side; and this is probably\r\ndue to the greater quantity of water-vapour in the air, for the moist\r\nwinds come from the south. Sunrises in the Alps are quite as glorious\r\nto behold as sunsets; but comparatively few people rise early enough\r\nto see them. Speaking generally, it may be said that in Alpine\r\nsunrises the prevailing colours are orange and gold, in sunsets\r\ncrimson or violet-pink. After a cool night the atmospheric conditions\r\nwill obviously be different from those which exist after a warm day,\r\nand more water-vapour will have been condensed into mist or cloud.\r\nHence we should expect a somewhat different effect.\r\n\r\nThe snowfields on high ranges of mountains are of a dazzling\r\nwhiteness; and their bright glare is so great as to distress the\r\neyes of those who walk over them without blue glasses, and even\r\nto cause inflammation. At these heights the traveller is not only\r\nexposed to the direct rays of the sun, untempered save for a thin\r\nveil of rarefied air, but also to an intense glare produced by the\r\nlittle snow-crystals which scatter around the beams of light falling\r\nupon them. Scientific men, who have studied these matters, say that\r\nthe scorching of the skin and \"sun-burning\" experienced by Alpine\r\ntravellers is not caused, as might be supposed, by the heat of the\r\nsun, but by the rays of light darting and flashing on all sides from\r\nmyriads of tiny snow-crystals.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a soft lambent glow has been observed on snowfields\r\nat night. This is a very curious phenomenon, to which the name of\r\n\"phosphorescence\" has, rightly or wrongly, been given. A pale light\r\nmay often be seen on the sea during a summer night, when the water\r\nis disturbed in any way; and if one is rowing in a boat, the oars\r\nseem glowing with a faint and beautiful light. It is well known that\r\nthis is caused by myriads of little light-producing animalcules\r\nin the sea-water. But we can hardly suppose that the glow above\r\nreferred to is produced by a similar cause. One observer says the\r\nglow is \"something like that produced by the flame of naphtha;\"\r\nand he goes on to say that at every step \"an illuminated circle\r\nor nimbus about two inches in breadth surrounded our feet, and we\r\nseemed to be ploughing our way through fields of light, and raising\r\nclods of it, if I may be allowed the expression, in our progress.\"\r\nAnother observer, also an Alpine traveller, says that at almost every\r\nfootstep the snowy particles, which his companion in front lifted\r\nwith his feet from the freshly fallen snow, fell in little luminous\r\nshowers. The exact cause which produces this strange effect at night\r\nhas not been ascertained.\r\n\r\nThere is another curious phenomenon often seen just before sunset on\r\na mountain in Hungary. It is known as \"The Spectre of the Brocken.\"\r\nThe Brocken is the highest summit of the Hartz Mountains. As you step\r\nout upon the plateau upon the top of the hill, your shadow, grim and\r\ngigantic, is apparently flung right out against the eastern sky,\r\nwhere it flits from place to place, following your every movement.\r\nThe explanation is simply this: to the east of the Hartz Mountains\r\nthere is always a very dense and hazy atmosphere, so dense that it\r\npresents a surface capable of receiving the impression of a shadow,\r\nand of retaining it, as a wall does. The shadows are really close\r\nat hand, not a long way off, as might at first sight be supposed. If\r\nvery far away, they would be too faint to be visible.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all mountainous regions the permanent habitations of men cease\r\nat a limit far below the most elevated points reached by the\r\nmountain-climber. St. Veran and Gargl, the highest villages of France\r\nand Germany, are situated at the respective heights of 6,591 and\r\n6,197 feet; but the Hospice of St. Bernard, in Switzerland, built\r\ncenturies ago to shelter travellers when benumbed with the cold, is\r\nmuch more elevated, its height being 8,110 feet above sea-level. The\r\nmost elevated cluster of houses in the world is the convent of Hanle,\r\ninhabited by twenty Thibetan priests; its height is 14,976 feet. None\r\nof the villages of the Andes, except perhaps that of Santa Anna, in\r\nBolivia, have been built at so great a height.\r\n\r\nTravellers who venture to ascend lofty mountains not only have to\r\nsuffer all the rigours of cold and run the risk of being frozen\r\non their route, but they may also experience painful sensations\r\nowing to the rarefaction of the air. It would naturally be supposed\r\nthat at an elevation at which the pressure of the atmosphere is\r\nreduced to one half, or even to one fourth that of the plains below,\r\na certain uneasiness should be caused by the change, the more so\r\nsince other conditions, such as warmth and moisture, are different.\r\nUndaunted climbers, like Professor Tyndall, who have never felt the\r\neffect of this \"mountain-sickness\" (_mal de montagne_), deny that\r\nthe sensations proceed from anything else than mere fatigue. In the\r\nHimalayas, the traveller does not begin to suffer from the attacks of\r\nthis ailment until he has reached a height of 16,500 feet; while on\r\nthe Andes a large number of persons are affected by it at an altitude\r\nof 10,700 feet. In the South American mountains, the symptoms are\r\nmuch more serious: to the fatigue, head-ache, and want of breath are\r\nadded giddiness, sometimes fainting-fits, and bleeding from lips,\r\ngums, and eyelids. The aeronaut, however, who is spared all the\r\nfatigue of climbing, rarely suffers any inconvenience except from\r\ncold, at such elevations. But on rising to greater heights, 30,000 or\r\n40,000 feet, the malady shows itself; and if the balloon continued to\r\nrise, the aerial voyager would infallibly perish.\r\n\r\nProfessor Bonney says:--\r\n\r\n   \"I have occasionally seen persons singularly affected on high\r\n   mountains; and as the barometer stands at about sixteen inches\r\n   on Mont Blanc, and at thirty at sea-level, one would expect\r\n   this great difference to be felt. Still, I do not think it easy\r\n   to separate the inconveniences due to atmosphere from those\r\n   caused by unwonted fatigue, and am inclined to attribute most\r\n   of them to the latter.\"\r\n\r\nBut the fact that the aeronaut suffers seems conclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe violent storms which break upon mountain districts often cause\r\nfloods of considerable magnitude, such as may be compared with the\r\nmemorable bursting of the Holmfirth reservoir. Hardly a year passes\r\nwithout considerable damage being done: bridges are swept away; roads\r\nare buried under torrents of mud, and fields overwhelmed with débris.\r\nIn August of the year 1860 a severe storm was witnessed by visitors\r\nstaying at Zermatt. It began with a thunder-storm; and rain fell for\r\nabout thirty-six hours, after which, as may be supposed, the torrents\r\nwere swollen far beyond their usual size. Lower down in the valleys\r\nmuch harm was done, but there one bridge only was swept away. It\r\nwas, however, an awful sight to see the Visp roaring under one of the\r\nbridges that remained, and to hear the heavy thuds of the boulders\r\nthat were being hurried on and dashed against one another by the\r\ntorrent.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1556, the town of Locarno, in the Canton Ticino, was\r\nvisited by a destructive storm and flood. The day began by several\r\nshocks of earthquake, followed, about five o'clock, by a terrific\r\ngale from the south. Part of the old castle was blown down; the doors\r\nof St. Victor's Church were burst open by a blast while the priest\r\nwas at the altar; and everything within was overturned. At midday the\r\nclouds were so thick that it was almost as dark as night. A violent\r\nthunder-storm and torrents of rain followed, lasting from two to six\r\no'clock in the evening. The rivulets all became torrents; the stream\r\nflowing through the town was so choked by uprooted trees and rocks\r\nthat its water flooded the streets and almost buried them under mud\r\nand gravel. Such a sight as this gives one a powerful impression of\r\nthe geological work of streams when greatly swollen; for all this\r\ndébris must have been brought down from the surrounding mountains.\r\nMany lives were lost by this calamity, and a great deal of property\r\nwas destroyed. Late in the year, during unsettled weather, the\r\ntraveller often encounters on Alpine passes a sudden storm of snow,\r\naccompanied by violent gusts of wind, which fill the air with drifted\r\nflakes; so that becoming bewildered, he loses his way, and at last\r\nsinks down benumbed with cold and dies. Many a frequented pass in\r\nSwitzerland has been the scene of death from this cause. Exhausted\r\nwith fatigue, and overcome with cold, the traveller sinks down by the\r\nwayside, and the guides, after having in vain endeavoured to urge him\r\non, are compelled, in order to save their own lives, to leave him to\r\nhis fate and press forward. The name \"Tourmente\" is given to these\r\nstorms.\r\n\r\nOn the tops of the highest mountains, even in very fine weather,\r\nthe wind often blows with great force; and the north wind, supposed\r\nto be the mountaineer's best friend, is sometimes his enemy. It\r\nnot unfrequently happens that a gale renders the passage of some\r\nexposed slope or ridge too dangerous, or the intense cold produces\r\nfrost-bites, so that an expedition has to be abandoned when success\r\nis within reach, which naturally is very annoying. Professor Bonney,\r\nspeaking of such a gale which he experienced in 1864, says,--\r\n\r\n   \"The cold was something horrible; the wind seemed to blow not\r\n   round, but through me, freezing my very marrow, and making my\r\n   teeth chatter like castanets; and if I stopped for a moment, I\r\n   shook as if in an ague-fit. It whisked up the small spiculæ of\r\n   frozen snow, and dashed them against my face with such violence\r\n   that it was hardly possible to look to windward. Thin sheets of\r\n   ice as large as my hand were whirled along the surface of the\r\n   glacier like paper.... When these gales are raging, the drifted\r\n   snow is blown far to leeward of the peaks in long streamers\r\n   like delicate cirrus-clouds; and on such occasions the mountain\r\n   is said by the guides _fumer sa pipe_ (to smoke his pipe). This\r\n   Mont Blanc was doing to some purpose the day that we were upon\r\n   him.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that these gales are often confined to the\r\ncrests of the mountains, so that the wind may be raging among the\r\npeaks while a few hundred feet lower down there is comparative calm.\r\n\r\nThe chief of the prevailing winds in the Alps is the Föhn. This is\r\na hot blast from the south which probably comes from the African\r\ndeserts. On its approach the air becomes close and stifling, the sky,\r\nat first of unusual clearness, gradually thickens to a muddy and\r\nmurky hue, animals become restless and disquieted by the unnatural\r\ndryness of the hot blast which now comes sweeping over the hills. In\r\nsome villages, it is said, all the fires are extinguished when this\r\nwind begins to blow, for fear lest some chance spark should fall on\r\nthe dry wooden roofs and set the whole place in a blaze. Still the\r\nFöhn is not altogether an \"ill wind that blows nobody any good,\"\r\nfor under its warm touch the winter snows melt away with marvellous\r\nrapidity. In the valley of Grindelwald it causes a snow-bed two\r\nfeet thick to disappear in about a couple of hours, and produces in\r\ntwenty-four hours a greater effect than the sun does in fifteen days.\r\nThere is a Swiss proverb which rather profanely says: \"If the Föhn\r\ndoes not blow, the golden sun and the good God can do nothing with\r\nthe snow.\"\r\n\r\nIn summer-time, however, the south wind is never welcome, for the\r\nvapour which it brings from the Italian plains is condensed by the\r\nsnows of the Alps, and streams down in torrents of rain.\r\n\r\n\r\nA thunder-storm is always a grand spectacle. Among mountains such\r\nstorms are more frequent than on the plains, and also, as might be\r\nexpected, far more magnificent, especially at night. Flashes, or\r\nrather sheets, of unutterable brilliancy light up the sky; distant\r\nchains of mountains are revealed for a moment, only to be instantly\r\neclipsed by the pall of night. Says Professor Bonney,--\r\n\r\n   \"No words can adequately express the awful grandeur of these\r\n   tempests when they burst among the mountains. I have often\r\n   been out in them,--in fact, far more frequently than was\r\n   pleasant; but perhaps the grandest of all was one that welcomed\r\n   me for the first time to Chamouni. As we entered the valley,\r\n   and caught sight of the white pinnacles of the _glacier des\r\n   Bossons_, a dark cloud came rolling up rapidly from the west.\r\n   Beneath it, just where two tall peaks towered up, the sky\r\n   glowed like a sheet of red-hot copper, and a lurid mist spread\r\n   over the neighbouring hills, wrapping them, as it seemed, in a\r\n   robe of flame. Onward rolled the cloud; the lightning began to\r\n   play; down the valley rushed a squall of wind, driving the dust\r\n   high in air before it, and followed by a torrent of rain.\r\n   Flash succeeded flash almost incessantly,--now darting from\r\n   cloud to cloud; now dividing itself into a number of separate\r\n   streaks of fire, and dancing all over the sky; now streaming\r\n   down upon the crags, and at times even leaping up from some\r\n   lofty peak into the air. The colours were often most beautiful,\r\n   and bright beyond description.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A STORM ON THE LAKE OF THUN. AFTER TURNER.]\r\n\r\nThe mountain traveller, when caught in a thunder-storm, undergoes a\r\nstrange experience, not unattended with danger. One observer[12] thus\r\ndescribes his sensations:--\r\n\r\n  [12] Mr. R. S. Watson, in \"The Alpine Journal,\" vol. i., p. 143.\r\n\r\n   \"A loud peal of thunder was heard; and shortly after I observed\r\n   that a strange singing sound, like that of a kettle, was\r\n   issuing from my alpenstock. We halted, and finding that all the\r\n   axes and stocks emitted the same sound, stuck them into the\r\n   snow. The guide from the hotel now pulled off his cap, shouting\r\n   that his head burned; and his hair was seen to have a similar\r\n   appearance to that which it would have presented had he been\r\n   on an insulated stool under a powerful electrical machine. We\r\n   all of us experienced the sensation of pricking and burning in\r\n   some part of the body, more especially in the head and face,\r\n   my hair also standing on end in an uncomfortable but very\r\n   amusing manner. The snow gave out a hissing sound, as though a\r\n   heavy shower of hail were falling; the veil on the wide-awake\r\n   of one of the party stood upright in the air; and on waving\r\n   our hands, the singing sound issued loudly from the fingers.\r\n   Whenever a peal of thunder was heard, the phenomenon ceased, to\r\n   be resumed before its echoes died away. At these times we felt\r\n   shocks, more or less violent, in those portions of the body\r\n   which were most affected. By one of these shocks my right arm\r\n   was paralysed so completely that I could neither use nor raise\r\n   it for several minutes, nor indeed until it had been severely\r\n   rubbed; and I suffered much pain in it at the shoulder-joint\r\n   for some hours.\"\r\n\r\nThe successive layers of snow which fall on the mountains do not\r\nremain there for ever. Unless got rid of in some way their thickness\r\nwould mount up to an enormous extent. It is reckoned that on the\r\nAlps the average yearly fall of snow is thirty-three feet. In the\r\ncourse of a century, therefore, the height of these mountains would\r\nbe increased by 3,300 feet, which we know is not the case. Various\r\ncauses prevent its accumulating, among which we may mention the\r\npowerful influence of the sun's rays, the evaporation promoted by\r\nthe atmosphere, the thawing influence of rain and mist, avalanches,\r\nand lastly, which is perhaps the most important, the fact that the\r\nsnow composing the snowfields, as they are called, of the high\r\nregions slowly creeps down towards the valleys, where they move\r\nalong as glaciers, the ends of which are gradually melted away by\r\nthe warm air surrounding them, and thus the muddy glacier-streams\r\nare originated. Few perils are more dreaded by the inhabitant of\r\nthe Alps than those of the avalanches. The particular way in which\r\neach avalanche descends is varied according to the shape of the\r\nmountain, the condition of the snow, and the time of the year. Hence\r\nthere are three different kinds of avalanche. First, there is the\r\nice-avalanche. The smaller glaciers, which, in the Alps, cling to the\r\nupper slopes of the higher mountains, frequently terminate abruptly\r\non the edge of some precipice. Thus the ice, urged on by the pressure\r\nof the masses above it, moves forward until it plunges over and\r\nfalls into the abyss below. Large portions break off; and these, as\r\nthey bound down the cliffs, are dashed into countless pieces, which\r\nleap from crag to crag high into the air: now the falling mass, like\r\nsome swollen torrent, dashes with sullen roar through a gully, now,\r\nemerging, crashes over a precipice, or spreads itself out like a fan,\r\nas it hisses down a snow-slope. These avalanches expend their force\r\nin the higher regions, and are harmless, unless any one happens to\r\nbe crossing their track at the time; but accidents from this source\r\ncan generally be avoided. In the distance the avalanches look like\r\nwaterfalls of the purest foam, but when approached are found to be\r\ncomposed of fragments of ice of every size, from one, two, or more\r\ncubic yards down to tiny little balls. In spring and summer, when the\r\nwhite layers, softened by the heat, are falling away every hour from\r\nthe lofty summits of the Alps, the pedestrian, taking up a position\r\non some adjacent headland, may watch these sudden cataracts dashing\r\ndown into the gorges from the heights of the shining peaks. Year\r\nafter year travellers seated at their ease on the grassy banks of\r\nthe Wengern Alp have watched with pleasure the avalanches rolling to\r\nthe base of the silvery pyramid of the Jungfrau. First, the mass of\r\nice is seen to plunge forth like a cataract, and lose itself in the\r\nlower parts of the mountain; whirlwinds of powdered snow, like clouds\r\nof bright smoke, rise far and wide into the air; and then, when the\r\ncloud has passed away, and the region has again assumed its solemn\r\ncalm, the thunder of the avalanche is suddenly heard reverberating\r\nin deep echoes in the mountain gorges, as if it were the voice of the\r\nmountain itself.\r\n\r\nThe other two kinds of avalanche are composed of snow. The\r\ndust-avalanche usually falls in winter-time, when the mountains are\r\ncovered deep with fresh-fallen snow. Such masses of snow, not yet\r\ncompacted into ice, rest insecurely upon the icy slopes, and hang\r\nin festoons and curtains over the peaks, or lie on smooth banks of\r\npasture, until some accident, such as a gust of wind, breaks the\r\nspell, and the whole mass slides down into the valley below. These\r\navalanches are accompanied by fearful blasts of wind which work dire\r\ndestruction. Almost the whole village of Leukerbad was destroyed by\r\none of these on the 14th of January, 1719, and fifty-five persons\r\nperished. In 1749, more than one hundred persons were killed in the\r\nvillage of Ruaras (Grisons), which during the night was overwhelmed\r\nby an avalanche. So silently were some of the houses buried that the\r\ninhabitants, on waking in the morning, could not conceive why the\r\nday did not dawn. It is said, though it seems almost incredible,\r\nthat in the time of the Suabian War, in the year 1498, one of these\r\navalanches swept four hundred soldiers over a cliff, and they all\r\nescaped without serious injury.\r\n\r\nThe army of General Macdonald, in his celebrated passage of\r\nthe Splügen in December, 1800, suffered severely from these\r\ndust-avalanches. A troupe of horse was completely cut through while\r\non the march; and thirty dragoons were precipitated into a gulf below\r\nthe road, where they all perished. And again, some days afterwards,\r\nin descending a gorge, the columns were repeatedly severed by\r\navalanches; and more than one hundred soldiers, with a number of\r\nhorses and mules, were lost. On one of these occasions the drummer\r\nof a regiment was carried away; and it is said that they heard him\r\nbeating his drum in the gorge below, in the hope that his comrades\r\nwould come to his rescue. Help, however, was out of the question. The\r\nsounds gradually became fainter, and the poor lad must have perished\r\nin the cold.\r\n\r\nThe ground-avalanches are different from those just described,\r\nconsisting of dense and almost solid masses of snow which have lain\r\nfor a long time exposed to atmospheric influences. They are much\r\nheavier than the dust-avalanches, and therefore more destructive;\r\nso that the inhabitants take great pains to protect themselves from\r\nthis source of danger. Thickly planted trees are the best protection\r\nagainst avalanches of every kind. Snow which has fallen in a wood\r\ncannot very well shift its place; and when masses of snow descend\r\nfrom the slopes above, they are unable to break through so strong\r\na barrier. Small shrubs, such as rhododendrons, or even heaths and\r\nmeadow-grass, are often sufficient to prevent the slipping of the\r\nsnow; and therefore it is very imprudent not to allow them to grow\r\nfreely on mountain-slopes. But it is still more dangerous to cut down\r\nprotecting forests, or even to do so partly. This was illustrated by\r\nthe case of a mountain in the Pyrenees, in the lofty valley of Neste;\r\nafter it had been partially cleared of trees, a tremendous avalanche\r\nfell down in 1846, and in its fall swept away more than fifteen\r\nthousand fir-trees.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss records tell us what a terrible scourge the avalanche can\r\nbe in villages which in summer-time appear such calm and happy\r\nscenes of pastoral life. M. Joanne, in the introduction to his\r\nvaluable \"Itinéraire de la Suisse\"[13] gives a list of twelve of\r\nthe most destructive avalanches that have fallen in Switzerland. In\r\nold days they seem to have been as great a source of danger as in\r\nmodern times. Thus we find that in the year 1500, a caravan of six\r\nhundred persons was swept away in crossing the Great St. Bernard;\r\nthree hundred were buried under an avalanche which fell from Monte\r\nCassedra (Ticino). Another one in the year 1720, at Obergestelen,\r\nin the Rhone Valley, destroyed one hundred and twenty cottages,\r\nfour hundred head of cattle, and eighty-eight persons. The bodies\r\nwere buried in a large pit in the village cemetery, on the wall\r\nof which was engraved the following pathetic inscription: \"O God,\r\nwhat sorrow!--eighty-eight in a single grave!\" (\"Gott, welche\r\nTrauer!--acht und achtzig in einem Grab!\")\r\n\r\n  [13] Conservateur Suisse, xlvi. p. 478, vol. xii.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that animals have a wonderful power of\r\nanticipating coming catastrophes. When human beings are unaware of\r\ndanger, they are often warned by the behaviour of animals. Country\r\npeople sometimes say that they can tell from the birds when the\r\nweather is about to change; and there is little doubt but that\r\nsea-gulls come inland before rough, stormy weather. But in the case\r\nof earthquakes the behaviour of birds, beasts, and even fishes is\r\nvery striking. It is said that before an earthquake rats, mice,\r\nmoles, lizards, and serpents frequently come out of their holes, and\r\nhasten hither and thither as if smitten with terror. At Naples, it\r\nis said that the ants quitted their underground passages some hours\r\nbefore the earthquake of July 26, 1805; that grasshoppers crossed\r\nthe town in order to reach the coast; and that the fish approached\r\nthe shore in shoals. Avalanches, it is well known, produce tremors\r\nsimilar to those due to slight earthquake shocks; and there are many\r\nstories in Switzerland of the behaviour of animals just before the\r\ncatastrophe takes place. Berlepsch relates that a pack-horse on the\r\nScaletta Pass, which was always most steady, became restive when\r\nan avalanche was coming; so that he was valuable to his owners in\r\nbad weather. One day, when near the summit of the pass, he suddenly\r\nstopped. They foolishly took no notice of his warning this time; but\r\nhe presently darted off at full speed. In a few seconds the avalanche\r\ncame and buried the whole party.\r\n\r\nIf these stories can be relied upon, it would seem that animals are\r\neither more sensitive to very slight tremors of the earth, or else\r\nthat they are more on the lookout than human beings. Perhaps North\r\nAmerican Indians have learned from animals in this respect, for they\r\ncan tell of a coming enemy on the march by putting their ears to the\r\nground and listening.\r\n\r\nBut there are worse dangers in the mountains than falls of snow and\r\nice, for sometimes masses of rock come hurtling down, or worse still,\r\nthe whole side of a mountain gives way and spreads ruin far and wide.\r\nPerpendicular or overhanging rocks, which seem securely fastened,\r\nsuddenly become detached and rush headlong down the mountain-side.\r\nIn their rapid fall, they raise a cloud of dust like the ashes\r\nvomited forth by a volcano; a horrible darkness is spread over a once\r\npleasant valley; and the unfortunate inhabitants, unable to see what\r\nis taking place, are only aware of the trembling of the ground, and\r\nthe crashing din of the rocks as they strike together and shatter one\r\nanother in pieces. When the cloud of dust is cleared away, nothing\r\nbut heaps of stones and rubbish are to be seen where pastures once\r\ngrew, or the peasant ploughed his acres in peace. The stream flowing\r\ndown the valley is obstructed in its course, and changed into a\r\nmuddy lake; the rampart of rocks from which some débris still comes\r\ncrumbling down has lost its old form; the sharpened edges point out\r\nthe denuded cliff from which a large part of the mountain has broken\r\naway. In the Pyrenees, Alps, and other important ranges there are but\r\nfew valleys where one cannot see the confused heaps of fallen rocks.\r\n\r\nMany of these catastrophes, known as the \"Bergfall,\" have been\r\nrecorded; and the records tell of the fearful havoc and destruction\r\nto life and property due to this cause. In Italy the ancient Roman\r\ntown of Velleja was buried, about the fourth century, by the downfall\r\nof the mountain of Rovinazzo; and the large quantity of bones and\r\ncoins that have been found proves that the fall was so sudden that\r\nthe inhabitants had no time to escape.\r\n\r\nTaurentum, another Roman town, situated, it is said, on the banks\r\nof Lake Geneva, at the base of one of the spurs of the Dent d'Oche,\r\nwas completely crushed in A. D. 563 by a downfall of rocks. The\r\nsloping heap of débris thus formed may still be seen advancing like a\r\nheadland into the waters of the lake. A terrible flood-wave, produced\r\nby the deluge of stones, reached the opposite shores of the lake and\r\nswept away all the inhabitants. Every town and village on the banks,\r\nfrom Morges to Vevay, was demolished, and they did not begin the work\r\nof rebuilding till the following century. Some say, however, that the\r\ndisaster was caused by a landslip which fell from the Grammont or\r\nDerochiaz across the valley of the Rhone, just above the spot where\r\nit flows into the Lake of Geneva. Hundreds of such falls have taken\r\nplace within the Alps and neighbouring mountains within historic\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nTwo out of the five peaks of the Diablerets fell down, one in 1714\r\nand the other in 1749, covering the pastures with a thick layer\r\nof stones and earth more than three hundred feet thick, and by\r\nobstructing the course of the stream of Lizerne, formed the three\r\nlakes of Derborence. In like manner the Bernina, the Dent du Midi,\r\nthe Dent de Mayen, and the Righi have overspread with ruin vast\r\ntracts of cultivated land. In Switzerland the most noted Bergfalls\r\nare those from the Diablerets and the Rossberg. The former mountain\r\nis a long flattish ridge with several small peaks, overhanging very\r\nsteep walls of rock on either side. These walls are composed of\r\nalternating beds of limestone and shale. Hence it is easily perceived\r\nthat we have here conditions favourable for landslips, because if\r\nanything weakens one of these beds of shale the overlying mass\r\nmight be inclined to break away. The fall in the year 1714, already\r\nreferred to, was a very destructive one.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE MATTERHORN. FROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY MR. DONKIN.]\r\n\r\n   \"For two whole days previously loud groaning had been heard to\r\n   issue from the mountain, as though some imprisoned spirit were\r\n   struggling to release himself, like Typhoeus from under Etna;\r\n   then a vast fragment of the upper part of the mountain broke\r\n   suddenly away and thundered down the precipices into the valley\r\n   beneath. In a few minutes fifty-five châlets, with sixteen\r\n   men and many head of cattle, were buried for ever under the\r\n   ruins. One remarkable escape has indeed been recorded, perhaps\r\n   the most marvellous ever known. A solitary herdsman from the\r\n   village of Avent occupied one of the châlets which were buried\r\n   under the fallen mass. Not a trace of it remained; his friends\r\n   in the valley below returned from their unsuccessful search,\r\n   and mourned him as dead. He was, however, still among the\r\n   living; a huge rock had fallen in such a manner as to protect\r\n   the roof of his châlet, which, as is often the case, rested\r\n   against a cliff. Above this, stones and earth had accumulated,\r\n   and the man was buried alive. Death would soon have released\r\n   him from his imprisonment, had not a little rill of water\r\n   forced its way through the débris and trickled into the châlet.\r\n   Supported by this and by his store of cheese, he lived three\r\n   months, labouring all the while incessantly to escape. Shortly\r\n   before Christmas he succeeded, after almost incredible toil, in\r\n   once more looking on the light of day, which his dazzled eyes,\r\n   so long accustomed to the murky darkness below, for a while\r\n   could scarcely support. He hastened down to his home in Avent,\r\n   and knocked at his own door; pale and haggard, he scarcely\r\n   seemed a being of this world. His relations would not believe\r\n   that one so long lost could yet be alive, and the door was shut\r\n   in his face. He turned to a friend's house; no better welcome\r\n   awaited him. Terror seized upon the village; the priest was\r\n   summoned to exorcise the supposed demon; and it was not till he\r\n   came that the unfortunate man could persuade them that he was\r\n   no spectre, but flesh and blood.\"[14]\r\n\r\n  [14] Bonney.\r\n\r\nThe valley is still a wild scene of desolation, owing to the\r\nenormous masses of stones of every shape and size with which its bed\r\nis filled.\r\n\r\nIn September of the year 1806, the second fall of the mountain\r\nRossberg took place, after a wet summer. It is underlaid by beds of\r\nclay which, when water penetrates, are apt to give way. The part\r\nwhich fell was about three miles long and 350 yards wide and 33 yards\r\nthick. In five minutes one of the most fertile valleys in Switzerland\r\nwas changed to a stony desert. Three whole villages, six churches,\r\n120 houses, 200 stables or châlets, 225 head of cattle, and much land\r\nwere buried under the ruins of the Rossberg; 484 persons lost their\r\nlives. Some remarkable escapes are recorded.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1618 the downfall of Monte Conto buried 2,400 inhabitants\r\nof the village of Pleurs, near Chiavenna. Excavation among the\r\nruins was subsequently attempted, but a few mangled corpses and a\r\nchurch-bell were all that could be reached.\r\n\r\nGeologically these phenomena, appalling as they are from the human\r\npoint of view, possess a certain interest, and their effects deserve\r\nto be studied.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another danger to which dwellers in mountains are\r\noccasionally exposed; namely, the earthquake. It seems to be an\r\nestablished fact that earthquake shocks are more frequent in\r\nmountainous than in flat countries. The origin of these dangerous\r\ndisturbances of the earth's crust has not yet been fully explained.\r\nThey are probably caused in various ways; and it is very likely\r\nthat the upheaval of mountain-chains is one of the causes at work.\r\nEarthquakes have for many years been carefully studied by scientific\r\nmen, and some valuable discoveries have been made. Thus we find that\r\nthey are more frequent in winter than summer, and also happen more\r\noften by night than by day. Day and night are like summer and winter\r\non a small scale, and so we need not be surprised at this discovery.\r\nSome have maintained that there is a connection between earthquakes\r\nand the position of the moon; while others consider that the state\r\nof the atmosphere also exerts an influence, and that earthquakes\r\nare connected with rainy seasons, storms, etc. Earthquakes are very\r\noften due to volcanic eruptions, but this is not always the case (see\r\nchapter vi., page 199).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAIN PLANTS AND ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n   The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats, and so are the\r\n   stony rocks for the conies.--_Psalm civ. 18._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere must be few people who have neither seen nor heard of the\r\nbeauty and exquisite colours of Alpine[15] flowers. They are first\r\nseen on the fringes of the stately woods above the cultivated\r\nland; then in multitudes on the sloping pastures with which many\r\nmountain-chains are robed, brightening the verdure with innumerable\r\ncolours; and higher up, where neither grass nor loose herbage can\r\nexist, among the slopes of shattered fragments which roll down from\r\nthe mountain-tops,--nay, even amidst the glaciers,--they gladden the\r\neye of the traveller and seem to plead sweetly with the spirits of\r\ndestruction. Alpine plants fringe the vast hills of snow and ice of\r\nthe high hills, and sometimes have scarcely time to flower and ripen\r\na few seeds before being again covered by their snowy bed. When\r\nthe season is unfavourable, numbers of them remain under the snow\r\nfor more than a year; and here they safely rest, unharmed by the\r\nalternations of frost and biting winds, with moist and springlike\r\ndays. They possess the great charm of endless variety of form and\r\ncolour, and represent widely separated divisions of the vegetable\r\nkingdom; but they are all small and low-growing compared to their\r\nrelatives grown in the plains, where the soil is richer and the\r\nclimate milder. Among them are tiny orchids quite as interesting\r\nin their way as those from the tropics; liliputian trees, and a\r\ntree-like moss (_Lycopodium dendroideum_) branching into an erect\r\nlittle pyramid as if in imitation of a mountain pine; ferns that peep\r\ncautiously from narrow rocky crevices as if clinging to the rock\r\nfor shelter from the cold blasts; bulbous plants, from lilies to\r\nbluebells; evergreen shrubs, perfect in leaf and blossom and fruit,\r\nyet so small that one's hat will cover them; exquisite creeping\r\nplants spreading freely along the ground, and when they creep over\r\nthe brows of rocks or stones, draping them with curtains of colour\r\nas lovely as those we see in the forests; numberless minute plants\r\nscarcely larger than mosses, mantling the earth with fresh green\r\ncarpets in the midst of winter; succulent plants in endless variety;\r\nand lastly the ferns, mosses, and lichens which are such an endless\r\nsource of pleasure and delight to the traveller. In short, Alpine\r\nvegetation presents us with nearly every type of plant life of\r\nnorthern and temperate climes, chastened in tone and diminished in\r\nsize.\r\n\r\n  [15] The word \"Alpine\" is used in a general sense to denote the\r\n  vegetation that grows naturally on the most elevated regions of\r\n  the earth; that is, on all high mountains, whether they rise up\r\n  in hot tropical plains or in cooler northern pastures.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to account for the small size of these plants;\r\nfor in the first place we cannot expect a large or luxuriant growth\r\nwhere the air is cold, the soil scanty, and the light of the sun\r\noften obscured by clouds, and where the changes of temperature are\r\nrapid,--which is very unfavourable to most plants. Again, in the\r\nclose struggle for existence which takes place on the plains and low\r\ntree-clad hills, the smaller forms of plant life are often overrun by\r\ntrees, trailing plants, bushes, and vigorous herbs; but where these\r\ncannot find a home, owing to the severity of the winter and other\r\ncauses, the little Alpine plants, covered up by snow in the winter,\r\ncan thrive abundantly. And lastly, like the older and conquered races\r\nof men who have been driven to the hills (see chap. i., p. 28) and\r\nfind shelter there, so there are both plants and animals living in\r\nthe mountains which man will not suffer to live in the plain where\r\nhe grows his crops, pastures his cattle, or builds his cities. We\r\nwould also venture to suggest that possibly some plants have been\r\nousted from plains by newer and more aggressive types, which came and\r\ntook their place. If so, vegetable life would afford an illustration\r\nof a process which has so often taken place in human history. This\r\nis only a speculation, but still it might be worth following up. If\r\nAlpine plants, or any considerable number of them, could be shown\r\nto belong to more ancient types, such as flourished in the later\r\ngeological periods, that would afford some evidence in favour of\r\nthe idea. Whether this is so or not, plant life on the mountains is\r\nalmost entirely protected from the destroying hands of men with their\r\nploughs and scythes, as well as from many grazing animals. As Mr.\r\nRuskin quaintly says:\r\n\r\n   \"The flowers which on the arable plain fell before the plough\r\n   now find out for themselves unapproachable places, where year\r\n   by year they gather into happier fellowship and fear no evil.\"\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the climate of a mountainous region determines the\r\ncharacter of the vegetation. Now, the climate will be different in\r\ndifferent parts of a mountain-range, and will depend upon the height\r\nabove the sea and other causes.[16] Some writers upon this subject\r\nhave attached too much importance to absolute height above the sea,\r\nas though this were the only cause at work. It is a very important\r\ncause, no doubt, but there are others which also have a great\r\ninfluence, such as the position of each locality with respect to the\r\ngreat mountain masses, the local conditions of exposure to the sun\r\nand protection from cold winds, or the reverse. However, in spite of\r\nlocal irregularities there are in the Alps certain broad zones or\r\nbelts of vegetation which may be briefly described as follows:--\r\n\r\n  [16] The following remarks are largely taken from the\r\n  Introduction to Ball's well-known \"Alpine Guide.\"\r\n\r\n1. _The Olive region._--This region curiously illustrates what has\r\njust been said about other causes besides height influencing the\r\nclimate and vegetation. For along the southern base of the Alps, the\r\nlower slopes and the mouths of the valleys have a decidedly warmer\r\nclimate than the plains of Piedmont and Lombardy. Thus, while the\r\nwinter climate of Milan is colder than that of Edinburgh, the olive\r\ncan ripen its fruit along the skirts of the mountain region, and\r\npenetrates to a certain distance towards the interior of the chain\r\nalong the lakes and the wider valleys of the Southern Alps. Even up\r\nthe shores of the Lake of Garda, where the evergreen oak grows, the\r\nolive has become wild. The milder climate of the Borromean Islands,\r\nand some points on the shores of the Lago Maggiore, will permit many\r\nplants of the warmer temperate zone to grow; while at a distance of a\r\nfew miles, and close to the shores of the same lake, but in positions\r\nexposed to the cold winds from the Alps, plants of the Alpine region\r\ngrow freely, and no delicate perennials can survive the winter. The\r\nolive has been known to resist a temperature of about 16° F. (or\r\n16° below the freezing point of water), but is generally destroyed\r\nby a less degree of cold. It can only be successfully cultivated\r\nwhere the winter frosts are neither long nor severe, where the mean\r\ntemperature of winter does not fall below 42° F., and a heat of 75°\r\nF. during the day is continued through four or five months of the\r\nsummer and autumn.\r\n\r\n2. _The Vine region._--The vine, being more tolerant of cold than the\r\nolive, can grow at a higher level; and so the next zone of vegetation\r\nin the Alps may be called \"the Vine region.\" But to give tolerable\r\nwine it requires at the season of ripening of the grape almost as\r\nmuch warmth as the olive needs. Vines can grow in the deeper valleys\r\nthroughout a great part of the Alpine chain, and in favourable\r\nsituations up to a considerable height on their northern slopes.\r\nOn the south side, although the limit of perpetual snow is lower,\r\nthe vine often reaches near to the foot of the greater peaks. But\r\nthe fitness of a particular spot for the production of wine depends\r\nfar more on the direction of the valley and of the prevailing winds\r\nthan on the height. And so it happens that in the Canton Valais, the\r\nValley of the Arc in Savoy, and some others on the north side of the\r\ndividing range, tolerable wine is made at a higher level than in the\r\nvalleys of Lombardy, whose direction allows the free passage of the\r\nkeen northern blasts. It is a curious fact that in the Alps the vine\r\noften resists a winter temperature which would kill it down to the\r\nroots in the low country; and we must explain it by the protection\r\nof the deep winter snow. Along with the vine many species of wild\r\nplants, especially annuals, characteristic of the flora of the south\r\nof Europe, show themselves in the valleys of the Alps.\r\n\r\n3. _The Mountain region, or region of deciduous trees._--Many writers\r\ntake the growth of corn as the characteristic of the colder temperate\r\nzone, corresponding to what has been called the mountain region of\r\nthe Alps. But so many varieties, all with different requirements,\r\nare in cultivation, that it is impossible to take the growth of\r\ncereals in general as marking clearly any natural division of the\r\nsurface. A more natural limit is marked by the presence of deciduous\r\ntrees (trees which shed their leaves). Although the oak, beech, and\r\nash do not exactly reach the same height, and are not often seen\r\ngrowing side by side in the Alps, yet their upper limit marks pretty\r\naccurately the transition from a temperate to a colder climate that\r\nis shown by a general change in the wild, herbaceous vegetation. The\r\nlower limit of this zone is too irregular to be exactly defined, but\r\nits upper boundary is about 4,000 feet on the cold north side of the\r\nAlps, and often rises to 5,500 feet on the southern slopes, which of\r\ncourse get more sunshine and warmth. The climate of this region is\r\nfavourable to the growth of such trees as the oak, beech, and ash,\r\nbut it does not follow that we should see them there in any great\r\nnumbers at the present time; for it is probable that at a very early\r\ndate they were extensively destroyed for building purposes, and to\r\nclear space for meadow and pasture land, so that with the exception\r\nof the beech forests of the Austrian Alps, there is scarcely a\r\nconsiderable wood of deciduous trees to be seen anywhere in the\r\nchain. In many districts where the population is not too dense, the\r\npine and Scotch fir have taken the place of the oak and beech, mainly\r\nbecause the young plants are not so eagerly attacked by goats, the\r\ngreat destroyers of trees.\r\n\r\n4. _The region of Coniferous trees._--Botanically this region is\r\nbest distinguished by the prevalence of coniferous trees, forming\r\nvast forests, which if not kept down by man (and by goats) would\r\ncover the slopes of the Alps. The prevailing species are the common\r\nfir and the silver fir. In districts where granite abounds, the\r\nlarch flourishes and reaches a greater size than any other tree.\r\nLess common are the Scotch fir and the arolla, or Siberian fir.\r\nIn the Eastern Alps the dwarf pine becomes conspicuous, forming\r\na distinct zone on the higher mountains above the level of other\r\nfirs. The pine forests play a most important part in the natural\r\neconomy of the Alps; and their preservation is a matter of very great\r\nimportance to the future inhabitants. But in some places they have\r\nbeen considerably diminished by cutting. This has especially happened\r\nin the neighbourhood of mines; and in consequence the people of the\r\nunfrequented communes have become so alive to this that some jealousy\r\nis felt of strangers wandering among the mountains, lest they should\r\ndiscover metals and cause the destruction of the woods. Their fears\r\nare not unreasonable; for the forests, besides exerting a good deal\r\nof influence on rainfall and climate, form natural defences against\r\nthe rush of the spring avalanches (see chapter iii., page 93). It is\r\nrecorded that after the war of 1799, in which many of those near the\r\nSt. Gothard Pass were destroyed, the neighbouring villages suffered\r\nterribly from this scourge. Hence the laws do not allow of timber\r\nbeing cut in certain forests called \"Bannwalde;\" and in most places\r\nthe right of felling trees is strictly regulated, and the woods are\r\nunder the inspection of officials.\r\n\r\nIn spots high up among the mountains, to which access is difficult,\r\nthe timber is converted into charcoal, which is then brought down\r\nin sacks by horses and mules. There are two ways in which timber is\r\nconveyed down from the forest: either it is cut up into logs some\r\nfive feet long, and thrown into a neighbouring torrent, which brings\r\nit down over cliff and gorge to the valley below; or else trough-like\r\nslides are constructed along the mountain-sides, down which the\r\ntrunks themselves are launched.\r\n\r\nIt is this region of coniferous trees which mainly determines the\r\nmanner of life of the population of the Alps. In the month of May the\r\nhorned cattle, having been fed in houses during the winter (as they\r\nare in the Scotch Highlands, where the cowsheds are called \"byres\"),\r\nare led up to the lower pastures. The lower châlets, occupied in May\r\nand part of June, generally stand at about the upper limit of the\r\nmountain region. Towards the middle or end of June the cattle are\r\nmoved up to the chief pastures, towards the upper part of the region\r\nof coniferous trees, where they usually remain for the next two or\r\nthree months. But there are some available pastures still higher up,\r\nand hither some of the cattle are sent for a month or more.\r\n\r\n5. _The Alpine region._--This is the zone of vegetation extending\r\nfrom the upper limit of trees to where permanent masses of snow first\r\nmake their appearance; so that where the trees cease, the peculiar\r\nAlpine plants begin; but we still find shrubs, such as the common\r\nrhododendron, Alpine willow, and the common juniper, which extend\r\nup to, and the latter even beyond, the level of perpetual snow. The\r\nlimits of this interesting and delightful botanical region may be\r\nfixed between 6,000 and 8,000 feet above the sea, and at least 1,000\r\nfeet higher on the south slopes of the Alps, which get more sunshine.\r\nIt is used to some extent for pasture; and in Piedmont it is not\r\nuncommon to find châlets at the height of 8,500 feet, and vegetation\r\noften extends freely up to 9,500 feet. Here and there, at levels\r\nbelow this zone, many Alpine species may be found, either transported\r\nby accident from their natural home, or finding a permanent\r\nrefuge in some cool spot sheltered from the sun, and moistened by\r\nstreamlets descending from the snow region. But it is chiefly here\r\nthat those delightful flowers grow which make the Alps like a great\r\nflower-garden,--great anemones, white and sulphur-coloured; gentians\r\nof the deepest blue, like the sky overhead; campanulas, geums, Alpine\r\nsolanellas, and forget-me-nots; asters, ox-eyed daisies, pale pink\r\nprimulas, purple heartsease, edelweiss, saxifrages, yellow poppies,\r\nAlpine toad-flax, monkshood, potentilla, and others too numerous to\r\nmention. Says Professor Bonney,--\r\n\r\n   \"Who cannot recall many a happy hour spent in rambling from\r\n   cluster to cluster on the side of some great Alp?--the scent of\r\n   sweet herbage or of sweeter daphne perfuming the invigorating\r\n   air, the melody of the cattle-bells borne up from some far-off\r\n   pasture, while the great blue vault of heaven above seems\r\n   reflected in the gentian clusters at his feet. The love of\r\n   flowers seems natural to almost every human being, however\r\n   forlorn his life may have been, however far it may have missed\r\n   its appointed mark. It may well be so; they at least are fresh\r\n   and untainted from their Maker's hand; the cry of 'Nature red\r\n   in tooth and claw' scarce breaks their calm repose. Side by\r\n   side they flourish without strife; none 'letteth or hindereth\r\n   another,' yet so tender and delicate, doomed to fade all too\r\n   soon, a touch of sadness is ever present to give a deeper\r\n   pathos to our love.\"\r\n\r\n6. _The Glacial region._--This comprehends all that portion of the\r\nAlps that rises above the limit of perpetual snow. But a word of\r\nexplanation is necessary. The highest parts of the Alps are not\r\ncovered by one continuous sheet of snow; otherwise we should never\r\nsee any peaks or crags there. Some are too steep for the snow to\r\nrest upon them, and therefore remain bare at heights much greater\r\nthan the so-called \"limit of perpetual snow,\" and that limit varies\r\nconsiderably. Still this term has a definite meaning when rightly\r\nunderstood. Leaving out of account masses of snow that accumulate in\r\nhollows shaded from the sun, the \"snow-line\" is fairly even, so that\r\non viewing an Alpine range from a distance, the larger patches and\r\nfields of snow on adjoining mountains, with the same aspect, are seen\r\nto maintain a pretty constant level.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ON A GLACIER.]\r\n\r\nVegetation becomes scarce in this region, not, as commonly supposed,\r\nbecause Alpine plants do not here find the necessary conditions for\r\ngrowth, but simply for want of soil. The intense heat of the direct\r\nrays of the sun (see chapter iii., pages 76-77) compensates for the\r\ncold of the night; and it is probable that the greater allowance of\r\nlight also stimulates vegetable life. But all the more level parts\r\nare covered with ice or snow; and the higher we ascend, the less the\r\nsurface remains bare, with the exception of the projecting rocks\r\nwhich usually undergo rapid destruction and breaking up from the\r\nfreezing of whatever water finds its way into their fissures.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, many species of flowering plants have been found even\r\nat the height of eleven thousand feet.\r\n\r\nIt is in this region that plants are found whose true home is in the\r\narctic regions (see chapter ii., pages 64-65).\r\n\r\nFor the sake of those who love ferns, lycopods, and other cryptogamic\r\nor flowerless plants, a few words may be said here. Of the\r\npolypodies, the beech fern and oak fern are generally common, so is\r\nthe limestone polypody in places where limestone occurs. Another\r\nspecies (_P. alpestre_) very like the lady fern grows plentifully\r\nin many places. The parsley fern, familiar to the botanist in Wales\r\nand other parts of Great Britain, is common, especially on the\r\ncrystalline rocks, and ascends to above seven thousand feet. The\r\nholly fern is perhaps the most characteristic one of the higher Alps.\r\nIt is abundant in almost every district from the Viso to the Tyrol,\r\nranging from about five thousand feet to nearly eight thousand feet.\r\nThe finest specimens are to be found in the limestone districts.\r\nNestling down in little channels worn out of the rock, it shoots out\r\ngreat fronds, often more than eighteen inches long, which are giants\r\ncompared to the stunted specimens seen on rockwork in English gardens.\r\n\r\n_Asplenium septentrionale_ is very common in most of the districts\r\nwhere crystalline rocks abound. The hart's tongue is hardly to be\r\ncalled a mountain fern. The common brake is confined to the lower\r\nslopes.\r\n\r\n_Cistopteris fragillis_ and _C. dentata_ are common, and the more\r\ndelicate _C. Alpina_ is not rare. The noble _Osmunda regalis_ keeps\r\nto the warmer valleys. The moonwort abounds in the upper pastures.\r\n\r\nThe club-mosses (_Lycopodium_), which are found in Great Britain,\r\nare common in most parts of the Alps, especially the _L. selago_,\r\nwhich grows almost up to the verge of the snows. Lower down is the\r\ndelicate _L. velveticum_, which creeps among the damp mosses under\r\nthe shade of the forest. Many of the smaller species stain with\r\nspots of crimson, orange, and purple the rocks among the snowfields\r\nand glaciers, and gain the summits of peaks more than eighteen\r\nthousand feet above the sea, reaching even to the highest rocks in\r\nthe Alpine chain. For the sake of readers who are not familiar with\r\nthat wonderful book, \"Modern Painters,\" we will quote some exquisite\r\npassages on lichens and mosses, full of beautiful thoughts:--\r\n\r\n  \"We have found beauty in the tree yielding fruit and in the herb\r\n  yielding seed. How of the herb yielding no seed,--the fruitless,\r\n  flowerless[17] lichen of the rock?\r\n\r\n    [17] Flowerless in the ordinary, not the botanical sense.\r\n\r\n  \"Lichens and mosses (though these last in their luxuriance are deep\r\n  and rich as herbage, yet both for the most part humblest of the\r\n  green things that live),--how of these? Meek creatures!--the first\r\n  mercy of the earth, veiling with trusted softness its dintless rocks,\r\n  creatures full of pity, covering with strange and tender honour\r\n  the scarred disgrace of ruin, laying quiet finger on the trembling\r\n  stones to teach them rest. No words that I know of will say what\r\n  these mosses are; none are delicate enough, none perfect enough, none\r\n  rich enough. How is one to tell of the rounded bosses of furred and\r\n  beaming green; the starred divisions of rubied bloom, fine-filmed, as\r\n  if the Rock Spirits could spin porphyry as we do grass; the traceries\r\n  of intricate silver, and fringes of amber, lustrous, arborescent,\r\n  burnished through every fibre into fitful brightness and glossy\r\n  traverses of silken change, yet all subdued and pensive, and framed\r\n  for simplest, sweetest offices of grace? They will not be gathered,\r\n  like the flowers, for chaplet or love token; but of these the wild\r\n  bird will make its nest and the wearied child his pillow.\r\n\r\n  \"And as the earth's first mercy, so they are its last gift to us.\r\n  When all other service is vain, from plant and tree the soft mosses\r\n  and grey lichen take up their watch by the headstone. The woods, the\r\n  blossoms, the gift-bearing grasses, have done their parts for a time,\r\n  but these do service for ever. Tree for the builder's yard--flowers\r\n  for the bride's chamber--corn for the granary--moss for the grave.\r\n\r\n  \"Yet as in one sense the humblest, in another they are the most\r\n  honoured of the earth-children; unfading as motionless, the worm\r\n  frets them not and the autumn wastes not. Strong in lowliness, they\r\n  neither blanch in heat nor pine in frost. To them, slow-fingered,\r\n  constant-hearted, is entrusted the weaving of the dark, eternal\r\n  tapestries of the hills; to them, slow-pencilled, iris-dyed, the\r\n  tender framing of their endless imagery. Sharing the stillness of\r\n  the unimpassioned rock, they share also its endurance; and while the\r\n  winds of departing spring scatter the white hawthorn blossom like\r\n  drifted snow, and summer dims on the parched meadow the drooping\r\n  of its cowslip,--gold far above, among the mountains, the silver\r\n  lichen-spots rest, star-like, on the stone; and the gathering\r\n  orange-stain upon the edge of yonder western peak reflects the\r\n  sunsets of a thousand years.\"\r\n\r\nAlpine and arctic plants are met with in Great Britain, but Scotland\r\nhas a much more extensive arctic-Alpine flora than England, Wales,\r\nor Ireland, the reason being the greater altitude of its mountains.\r\nThe combined flora of the United Kingdom contains only ninety-one\r\nspecies of arctic-Alpine plants, and of these eighty-eight--that is,\r\nall but three--are natives of Scotland. Of these three the first is\r\na gentian (_Gentiana verna_), which is to be found on the hills of\r\nWest Yorkshire, Durham, Westmoreland, and other parts. It comes from\r\nthe Alps. The second is _Lloydia serotina_,--a small bulbous plant\r\nwith white flowers, which is found on the hills of Carnarvonshire,\r\nin Wales. The third, well known in English gardens, is London pride\r\n(_Saxifraga umbrosa_), which is only to be found on the southwest\r\nIrish hills.\r\n\r\nOf the ninety-one arctic-Alpine species, just about half are also\r\nnatives of England and Wales, but only twenty-five belong to Ireland.\r\nIf we examine the lists of the flora of Arctic Europe we find that\r\nall these, except about six, are found in arctic regions; and if we\r\ntravel farther north till we come actually to polar regions, we find\r\nnearly fifty of these species growing there near the sea-level. The\r\nGrampian Mountains are the chief centre of the Scottish arctic-Alpine\r\nflora. The two principal localities for such flowers in that range\r\nare the Breadalbane Mountains in Perthshire, and the Cænlochan and\r\nClova Mountains of Forfarshire. There are also a goodly number on the\r\nmountains of the Braemar district.\r\n\r\nThe history of the arctic-Alpine flora of Europe is a very\r\ninteresting one. These plants, whose true home is in the arctic\r\nregions, living high up on the mountains of Europe, give unmistakable\r\nevidence of a time, very far back, when Northern Europe was overrun\r\nby glaciers and snowfields so as to resemble in appearance and in\r\nclimate the Greenland of the present day. This period is known to\r\ngeologists as the \"Great Ice Age.\" The moraines of glaciers, ice-worn\r\nrock surfaces, and other unmistakable signs may be well seen in\r\nmany parts of Great Britain. How long ago this took place we cannot\r\nsay; but judging from the considerable changes in geography which\r\nhave undoubtedly taken place since then, we must conclude that many\r\nthousands of years, perhaps two hundred thousand, have intervened\r\nbetween this period and the present time.\r\n\r\nWhen arctic conditions prevailed over this wide area, the plants\r\nand animals which now live in arctic latitudes flourished in Great\r\nBritain; but as the climate gradually became more genial, and the\r\nsnow and ice melted, the plants and animals mostly retreated to\r\ntheir northern home. A certain number doubtless became extinct; but\r\nothers took to the highest parts of the mountains, where snow and\r\nice abound; and there they remain to the present day, separated from\r\ntheir fellows, but still enjoying the kind of climate to which they\r\nhave always been accustomed, and testifying to the wonderful changes\r\nwhich have taken place since the mammoth, whose bones are found\r\nembedded in our river-gravels, wandered over the plains of Northern\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Animal Life._\r\n\r\nThe rocky fastnesses of the Alps still afford a home to some of the\r\nlarger wild animals which in other parts of Europe have gradually\r\ndisappeared with the advance of civilisation. During the latter part\r\nof the \"Stone Age,\" long before history was written, when men used\r\naxes, hammers, arrow-heads, and other implements of stone, instead of\r\nbronze or iron, Switzerland was inhabited by animals which are not to\r\nbe seen now. The gigantic urus (_Bos primigenius_), which flourished\r\nin the forests of the interior during this prehistoric human period,\r\nand gave its name to the canton of Uri, has become extinct. The marsh\r\nhog was living during the period of the Swiss lake-dwellers. These\r\npeople made their houses on piles driven in near the shore, and were\r\nacquainted with the use of bronze, and therefore later than the men\r\nof the \"Stone Age.\" The remains of these strange dwelling-places\r\nhave been discovered in several places, as well as many articles of\r\ndaily use. The marsh hog has disappeared; and its place is taken by\r\nthe wild boar and domestic hog, which afford sport and food to the\r\npresent population. But taking Switzerland as it now is, we will say\r\na few words about the more interesting forms of animal life dwelling\r\nin the Alps, beginning with those which are highest in the animal\r\nkingdom. Chief among these is the brown bear, still occasionally\r\nfound, but it is exceedingly rare, except in the Grisons and in the\r\ndistricts of the Tyrol and Italy bordering on the canton, where it\r\nstill carries on its ravages.[18] Some also believe that it still\r\nlingers in the rocky fastnesses of the Jura Mountains, to the east of\r\nthe Alps. There is properly only one species of bear in Switzerland,\r\nbut the hunters generally speak of three,--the great black, the\r\ngreat grey, and the small brown. The second of these is merely an\r\naccidental variety of the first; but between the grey and the small\r\nbrown bears there is a good deal of difference. They assert that\r\nthe black bear is not only considerably larger than the brown, but\r\nis also different in its habits. It is less ferocious and prefers a\r\nvegetable diet,--feeding on herbs, corn, and vegetables, with the\r\nroots and branches of trees. It has a way of plundering bee-hives and\r\nalso ants' nests; it delights in strawberries and all kinds of fruit,\r\nplundering the orchards, and even making raids on the vineyards,\r\nbut always retreating before dawn. As a rule it does not attack\r\nhuman beings. The brown bear is much more formidable, prowling by\r\nnight about the sheepfolds, and causing the sheep by their fright to\r\nfall down precipices. Goats, when alarmed, leap on the roofs of the\r\nchâlets, and bleat, in order to arouse the shepherds; so that when\r\nBruin rears himself up against the wall he often meets his death.\r\nThere are many stories on record of fierce fights for life between\r\nman and bear. The bear passes the winter in a torpid state, and eats\r\nlittle or nothing then.\r\n\r\n  [18] We are again indebted to Professor Bonney's \"Alpine Regions\r\n  of Switzerland\" for the information here given.\r\n\r\nThe wolf, though still lingering in several lonely parts of the\r\nAlps, is rapidly becoming rare. It is most frequent in the districts\r\nabout the Engadine and in the Jura Mountains. Only in winter-time,\r\nwhen hard pressed by hunger, does it approach the haunts of man. It\r\ntakes almost any kind of prey it can get,--foxes, hares, rats, mice,\r\nbirds, lizards, frogs, and toads. Sheep and goats are its favourite\r\nprey. The wolf is an affectionate parent, and takes his turn in\r\nlooking after the nurslings, which is a necessary precaution, as his\r\nfriends and relations have a way of eating up the babies.\r\n\r\nThe fox is common in many parts of the Alps, but not often seen\r\nby travellers. Instead of taking the trouble to burrow, he\r\nfrequently manages by various cunning devices to take possession\r\nof a badger's hole. As Tschudi quaintly observes, \"He has far too\r\nmuch imagination and poetic sentiment to like so monotonous and\r\nlaborious an occupation as burrowing.\" Like the wolf, the mountain\r\nfox eats whatever he can catch, even beetles, flies, and bees. Those\r\nin the valleys live more luxuriously than their relations on the\r\nmountains,--plundering bee-hives and robbing orchards. As it was in\r\nJudæa in the days of Solomon, so it is now in Switzerland among the\r\nvineyards; and a peasant might well say, \"Take us the foxes, the\r\nlittle foxes that spoil the vineyards.\"\r\n\r\nThe lynx is only occasionally found in the Alps, which is fortunate\r\nfor the shepherds, for they can play terrible havoc with the sheep.\r\n\r\nWild-cats still linger in the most unfrequented parts. Their fur is\r\nvaluable, and the flesh is sometimes eaten. The badger is far from\r\ncommon, though rarely seen by day. It is very cunning in avoiding\r\ntraps, and so is generally either dug out of its hole drawn by\r\ndogs, or pulled out by a pole with nippers or a hook at the end.\r\nPassing on to less ferocious beasts, we find the otter common along\r\nthe borders of rivers and lakes. The polecat, weasel, and stoat\r\nare often too abundant for keepers of poultry. The squirrel is\r\ncommon enough in the forests, but varies greatly in colour. It is\r\ndoubtful whether the beaver still lingers by some lonely Alpine\r\nstream. It is last mentioned in a list of Swiss mammals, published\r\nin 1817, as found, though rarely, in some lonely spots. Rabbits are\r\ncommon, but hares rather scarce; of these there are, as in Scotland,\r\ntwo varieties,--the brown hare, which is seldom found at heights\r\ngreater than four thousand to five thousand feet, and the blue\r\nhare, which ranges up to nine thousand feet. The latter changes\r\ncolour: its fur in summer is of a dull bluish-grey, and in winter it\r\nbecomes perfectly white, and so affords a striking illustration of\r\n\"protective mimicry,\" for with snow lying on the ground it would be\r\nvery hard to see the creature.\r\n\r\nThe marmot is common in all the higher Alpine regions. These\r\ninteresting little creatures are very watchful, and easily scent\r\ndanger. When an intruder approaches, a sentinel marmot utters a\r\nlong shrill whistle, which is often repeated two or three times,\r\nand then they all make for their burrows; but it is not easy to\r\ndistinguish them from the grey rocks among which they live. The fur\r\nis a yellowish or brownish grey, with black on the head and face,\r\nand a little white on the muzzle; the tail is short and bushy with a\r\ntipping of black. They have different quarters for summer and winter.\r\nThe summer burrows are in the belt of rough pasture between the\r\nupper limits of trees and the snows; towards the end of autumn they\r\ncome down to the pastures which the herdsmen have just abandoned\r\nand there make their winter burrows, which are much larger than the\r\nsummer ones. Like rabbits, they frequently make a bolt-hole, by which\r\nthey may escape from an intruder. In winter the holes are plugged up,\r\nand the marmots, rolling themselves up in a ball, go to sleep for six\r\nmonths or more. Sometimes hunters dig them out; but so soundly do\r\nthey sleep that, according to De Saussure, they may often be taken\r\nout, placed in the game-bag, and carried home without being aroused.\r\nThey wake up about April.\r\n\r\nThe chamois, a very favourite subject with the wood-carvers, is the\r\nonly member of the antelope family in Western Europe; it is found\r\nin almost every part of the Alps, but is now much rarer than it was\r\nformerly. A full-grown chamois in good condition weighs about sixty\r\npounds. The hair is thick, and changes colour with the season, being\r\na red yellowish-brown in summer and almost black in winter. The\r\nhorns, which curve backwards, rise from the head above and between\r\nthe eyes to a height which rarely exceeds seven inches. When the\r\nkid is about three months old, the horns make their appearance, and\r\nat first are not nearly as hook-shaped as they afterwards become.\r\nWhen full-grown, it stands at the shoulder about two feet from the\r\nground. The hind-legs being longer than the fore-legs, its gait is\r\nawkward on level ground, but they are admirably suited for mountain\r\nclimbing. When at full speed, it can check itself almost instantly,\r\nand can spring with wonderful agility. Its hoofs are not well adapted\r\nfor traversing the ice, and therefore it avoids glaciers as far as\r\npossible. Having a great fear of concealed crevasses, it is very\r\nshy of venturing on the upper part of a glacier; and the tracks\r\nwhich it leaves in these places often show by their windings and\r\nsudden turnings that the animal has exercised great caution. And so\r\ntravellers often use this as a useful clue to getting safely over\r\na glacier. Its agility is something extraordinary. It can spring\r\nacross chasms six or seven yards wide, and \"with a sudden bound leap\r\nup the face of a perpendicular rock, and merely touching it with its\r\nhoofs, rebound again in an opposite direction to some higher crag,\r\nand thus escape from a spot where, without wings, egress seemed\r\nimpossible. When reaching upwards on its hind-legs, the fore-legs\r\nresting on some higher spot, it is able to stretch to a considerable\r\ndistance, and with a quick spring bring up its hind-quarters to a\r\nlevel with the rest of the body, and with all four hoofs together,\r\nstand poised on a point of rock not broader than your hand.\"[19] The\r\nchamois feed on various mountain herbs, and on the buds and sprouts\r\nof the rhododendron and latschen (a pine). At night they couch among\r\nthe broken rocks high upon the mountains, descending at daybreak\r\nto pasture, and retreating, as the heat increases, towards their\r\nfastnesses. When winter comes, they are forced down to the higher\r\nforests, where they pick up a scanty subsistence from moss, dead\r\nleaves, and the fibrous lichen which hangs in long yellowish-grey\r\ntufts from the fir-trees and bears the name of \"chamois-beard.\"\r\nWhile browsing on this, they sometimes get their horns hooked in a\r\nbough, and so, being unable to disentangle themselves, perish with\r\nhunger. The senses of hearing, smell, and sight are exceedingly\r\nacute; so that the hunter must exercise all his craft to approach\r\nthe animals. Pages might be filled with the hair-breadth escapes and\r\nfearful accidents which have befallen hunters; and yet they find the\r\npursuit so fascinating that nothing will induce them to abandon it. A\r\nyoung peasant told the famous De Saussure (the pioneer of Alpine\r\nexplorers) that though his father and grandfather before him had met\r\ntheir death while out on the hunt, not even the offer of a fortune\r\nwould tempt him to change his vocation. The bag which he carried with\r\nhim he called his winding-sheet, because he felt sure he would never\r\nhave any other. Two years afterwards he was found dead at the foot of\r\na precipice.\r\n\r\n  [19] Bonar on Chamois-hunting in Bavaria.\r\n\r\nThe bouquetin, or steinbock, once abundant throughout the greater\r\npart of the Alps, is now confined to certain parts where it is\r\npreserved by the King of Italy. De Saussure observes that in his\r\ntime they had ceased to be found near Chamouni. Its whole build is\r\nremarkably strong, giving it quite a different appearance from the\r\nslender and graceful chamois.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: RED DEER. AFTER ANSDELL.]\r\n\r\nThe roe, the fallow deer, and the red deer have, it is said, quite\r\ndisappeared from the French and Swiss Alps, but all of them occur in\r\nthe Bavarian and Austrian highlands. They frequent the forests which\r\nclothe the lower slopes, and do not often wander into the more rocky\r\ndistricts. The wild boar only now and then appears across the Rhine,\r\nalthough it is common in the Subalpine forests farther east; but we\r\ncan hardly consider it a true Alpine quadruped.\r\n\r\nPassing on to the birds which frequent the Alps, we must first notice\r\nthe bearded vulture, the lämmergeier of the Germans, which once was\r\ncommon, but now only holds its own here and there in some lonely\r\nmountain fastness. Although preferring living prey to carrion, still\r\nin many ways it is closely allied to the true vulture. The upper part\r\nof the body is a greyish-brown hue, the under side white, tinged with\r\nreddish brown. The nest, built on a high ledge of rock, consists of\r\nstraw and fern, resting on sticks, on which are placed branches lined\r\nwith moss and down. It is a rare thing for the traveller to obtain\r\na view of this monarch of the Alpine birds. Like the true vulture,\r\nits digestive powers are marvellous. According to Tschudi (\"Les\r\nAlpes\"), the stomach of one of these birds was found to contain five\r\nfragments of a cow's rib, a mass of matted wool and hair, and the\r\nleg of a kid perfect from the knee downwards. Another had bolted a\r\nfox's rib fifteen inches long, as well as the brush, besides a number\r\nof bones and other indigestible parts of smaller animals, which\r\nwere slowly being eaten away by the gastric juice. Sheep, goats,\r\nfull-grown chamois, and smaller quadrupeds are eagerly devoured by\r\nthis voracious bird. It is said to be bold enough to attack a man,\r\nwhen it finds him asleep or climbing in any dangerous place. Tschudi,\r\nin his book on the Alps, gives several instances of young children\r\nbeing carried off. One of these happened in the Bernese Oberland, as\r\nfollows: Two peasants, making hay upon the pastures, had taken with\r\nthem their daughter Anna, a child about three years old. She quickly\r\nfell asleep on the turf near the hay châlet; so the father put his\r\nbroad-brimmed hat over her face, and went to work some little way\r\noff. On his return with a load of hay the child was gone; and a brief\r\nsearch showed that she was nowhere near. Just at this time a peasant\r\nwalking along a rough path in the glen was startled by the cry of a\r\nchild, and going towards the place whence it came, saw a lämmergeier\r\nrise from a neighbouring summit and hover for some time over a\r\nprecipice. On climbing thither in all haste, he found the child\r\nlying on the very brink. She was but little injured; some scratches\r\nwere found on her hands and on the left arm, by which she had been\r\nseized; and she had been carried more than three quarters of a mile\r\nthrough the air. She lived to a good old age, and was always called\r\nthe Geier-Anna, or Vulture's Annie, in memory of her escape. The\r\nparticulars are inscribed in the registers of the parish of Habkeren.\r\n\r\nThe golden eagle is not uncommon in most parts of the Alps, although\r\ntravellers rarely obtain a near view. It is said to be very fond\r\nof hares, chasing and capturing them very cleverly. As in Great\r\nBritain, it is accused of carrying off children; but this is at least\r\ndoubtful. The kite, buzzard and falcon are occasionally seen. There\r\nare at least ten species of owls, among which is the magnificent\r\neagle-owl. The raven is found in the lonelier glens, and is often\r\ntamed. Its thieving propensities are very amusing. Alpine birds\r\nof prey correspond very closely with British. The jackdaw is also\r\ncommon. It would be impossible within our short limits to give\r\na complete list of Swiss birds, but we may mention among others\r\nthe nutcracker, the jay, the white-breasted swift, the wheatear,\r\nthe common black redstart, the beautiful wall-creeper, and the\r\nsnow-finch, which mounts to the borders of the snow. Of game-birds\r\nwe may mention the capercailze, the black grouse, and the hazel\r\ngrouse, all of which are common in many of the forests. The ptarmigan\r\nhaunts the stony tracts on the borders of perpetual snow. In winter\r\nit turns white, and in summer greyish-brown, though a good deal of\r\nwhite remains.\r\n\r\nPheasants and partridges cannot be said to be Alpine birds; but the\r\nGreek partridge may be so considered.\r\n\r\nNumbers of the mountain streams and tarns contain excellent trout,\r\nand most of the larger lakes are well stocked with fish. Some of the\r\ntrout of the Swiss and Italian lakes are of great size. The pike\r\nfrequently weigh twelve to fifteen pounds.\r\n\r\nReptiles are not numerous. The common frog, which is said to be found\r\nas high as ten thousand feet above the sea, swarms in some parts of\r\nthe Rhone Valley. Of true lizards, five species have been recognized.\r\nThe blind-worm (which is not a snake), so common on many of our\r\nEnglish heaths, is often met with. Among the true snakes we find the\r\nEnglish ringed snake--quite harmless--and two adders. The common\r\nadder is found at a height of seven thousand feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nLower forms of life not possessing a backbone (invertebrates) abound\r\nin this region; but they are far too numerous to be considered here.\r\nButterflies and moths are abundant; and many of those which are rare\r\nin England are common in the Alps, so that the entomologist finds\r\na happy hunting-ground. The beautiful swallowtail and the handsome\r\napollo, coppers, painted ladies, fritillaries, and many other\r\nLepidoptera thrive in these regions, and are less easily frightened\r\nthan at home in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nHOW THE MOUNTAINS WERE MADE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart II.\r\n\r\nHOW THE MOUNTAINS WERE MADE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nHOW THE MATERIALS WERE BROUGHT TOGETHER.\r\n\r\n    These changes in the heavens, though slow, produce\r\n    Like change on sea and land.\r\n\r\n    MILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably every mountain climber, resting for a brief space on a loose\r\nboulder, or seeking the shade of some overhanging piece of rock, has\r\noften asked himself, \"How were all these rocks made?\" The question\r\nmust occur again and again to any intelligent person on visiting a\r\nmountain for the first time, or even on seeing a mountain-range in\r\nthe distance. He may well ask his companions how these great ramparts\r\nof the earth were built up. But unless he possesses some knowledge\r\nof the science of geology, which tells of the manifold changes which\r\nin former ages have taken place on the earth, or unless, in the\r\nabsence of such knowledge, he chance to meet with a geologist, his\r\nquestion probably remains unanswered. Such questions, however, can\r\nbe very satisfactorily answered,--thanks to the labours of zealous\r\nseekers after truth, who have given the best part of their lives\r\nto studying the rocks which are found everywhere on the surface of\r\nthe earth, and the changes they undergo. Geology is a truly English\r\nscience; and Englishmen may well cherish gratefully the memories of\r\nits pioneers,--Hutton, Playfair, Lyell, and others, who have made the\r\nway so clear for future explorers.\r\n\r\nThe story of the hills as written on their own rocky tablets and on\r\nthe very boulders lying loose on their sloping sides, and interpreted\r\nby geologists, is a long one; for it takes us far back into the dim\r\nages of the past, and like the fashionable novel, may be divided into\r\nthree parts, or volumes. To those who follow the stony science it\r\nis quite as fascinating as a modern romance, and a great deal more\r\nwonderful, thus illustrating the force of the old saying, \"Truth is\r\nstranger than fiction.\"\r\n\r\nThe three parts of our story may be best expressed by the three\r\nfollowing inquiries:\r\n\r\n   I. How were the materials of which mountains are built up\r\n   brought together and made into hard rock?\r\n\r\n   II. How were they raised up into the elevated positions in\r\n   which we now find them?\r\n\r\n   III. How were they carved out into all their wonderful and\r\n   beautiful features of crag and precipice, peaks and passes?\r\n\r\nA mountain group, with its central peak or spire, its long ridges,\r\nsteep walls, towers, buttresses, dark hollows, and carved pinnacles\r\nstanding out against the sky, has well been compared to a great\r\nand stately building such as a cathedral or a temple. Mountains\r\nare indeed \"a great and noble architecture, giving first shelter,\r\ncomfort, and rest, but covered also with mighty sculpture and painted\r\nlegend;\" and to many they are Nature's shrines, where men may offer\r\ntheir humble praises and prayers to the great Architect who reared\r\nthem for His children. We have introduced this illustration because\r\nit will help us in our inquiry. Suppose we were standing in front of\r\nsome great cathedral, such as Milan, with all its marble pinnacles,\r\nor Notre Dame, with its stately towers, or the minsters of York or\r\nDurham in our own country, and trying to picture to ourselves how\r\nit was built. No one has lived long enough to watch the completion\r\nof one of these great buildings; but for all that, we know pretty\r\nwell how it was made, even by watching the builder's operations for\r\na short time, or by following, as we often may, the various stages\r\nin the construction of a small house. So it is with Nature's work.\r\nWe cannot, in our little lives, witness the rearing of a great\r\nmountain-chain, or even the carving of a single hill; but we can\r\nobserve for ourselves the slow and continuous operations which in the\r\ncourse of thousands and thousands of years produce such stupendous\r\nresults. We may learn how the building operations are conducted,\r\nthough the final results will only be manifested in the far-distant\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our cathedral. If we try to picture to ourselves\r\nthe long years during which it was covered with scaffolding and\r\nsurrounded by a busy army of workers, we shall soon perceive that\r\nthe operations may be broadly divided into three heads. _First_, we\r\nmust inquire how the separate stones of which it is composed were\r\nbrought together into one place, and we shall at once picture to\r\nourselves groups of men working in stone-quarries,--perhaps a long\r\nway off,--busy with their crowbars and hammers, breaking off large\r\nblocks of stone, and following the natural divisions of the rock\r\nthat their rough labour may be lessened; for all rocks will split\r\nmore easily along certain lines than along others. Sometimes it is\r\neasier to follow the \"bedding,\" or natural layers in which the rock\r\nwas formed; at other times the \"joints,\" or cracks subsequently\r\nformed as the rocky materials hardened and contracted in bulk, afford\r\neasier lines for the workmen to follow. Others are busily engaged in\r\nplacing the stony blocks on trollies drawn by horses, that they may\r\nbe borne along the roads leading from the quarry to the site of the\r\nfuture cathedral. And so, taking a bird's-eye view, we seem to see\r\nhorses and carts slowly moving on from many a distant quarry, but\r\nall converging like the branches of a river to one main channel, and\r\nfinally depositing their burdens in the stone-yard where the masons\r\nare at work. Perhaps bricks are partly employed, in which case we can\r\neasily picture to ourselves the brickyards, where some are digging\r\nout the soft clay, others moulding it into bricks with wooden moulds,\r\nwhile others again lay them down in rows on the ground to dry, before\r\nthey are baked in the ovens. And when the bricks are ready for\r\nuse, the same means of transportation are employed; and cart-loads\r\nof them are borne along the country roads until they so reach their\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nNow, all this may be summed up in the one word \"transportation;\"\r\nand we shall presently inquire how the rocky matter of which the\r\nmountains are built was transported.\r\n\r\n_Secondly._ We have to inquire how the bricks and stones were raised\r\nup. The analogy is not quite perfect in this case; for the mountains\r\nwere raised up _en bloc_, not bit by bit and stone by stone, as in\r\nthe case of the cathedral. Still they have been raised somehow.\r\nAnalogies are seldom complete in every detail; but for all that, our\r\nillustration serves well enough, and will help us in following the\r\nvarious processes of mountain building. In these days, the raising of\r\nthe stones is mostly effected by steam-power applied to big cranes\r\nand pulleys. In old days they used cranes and pulleys, but the ropes\r\nwere pulled by hand-power. In either case the work proceeds slowly;\r\nand we can easily picture to ourselves the daily raising of the\r\nstones of which the cathedral is composed. \"What were the forces\r\nat work which slowly raised the mountains?\" This question we will\r\nendeavour to answer later on (see next chapter). This work may be\r\nincluded in the one word, \"elevation.\"\r\n\r\n_And lastly._ We must inquire how the carving of the stately building\r\nwas effected, how its pinnacles received their shape, and how all\r\nthose lovely details received their final forms; how the intricate\r\ntraceries of its windows were made, and the statues carved which\r\nadorn its solemn portals. This question is easily answered, for we\r\nare all more or less familiar with what goes on in a stone-mason's\r\nyard. Under those wooden sheds we see a number of skilled labourers\r\nat work, busy with their chisels and mallets, cutting out, according\r\nto the patterns made from the architect's detailed drawings, the\r\nportions of tracery for windows, or the finials, crockets, and other\r\nfeatures of the future building. In another part of the yard may be\r\nseen the stone-cutters, working in pairs and slowly pulling backwards\r\nand forwards those long saws which, with the help of water and sand,\r\nin time cut through the biggest blocks. All this work then may be\r\nsummed up under the one word, \"ornamentation,\" for it includes the\r\ncutting and carving of the stone.\r\n\r\nOur three lines of inquiry may now be summed up in these three words,\r\nwhich are easily remembered:--\r\n\r\n    _Transportation_,\r\n    _Elevation_,\r\n    _Ornamentation_.\r\n\r\nTaking the first of these subjects for consideration in the present\r\nchapter, we have now to inquire into the nature of the materials of\r\nwhich mountains are composed and the means by which they have been\r\nbrought together and compacted into hard rock.\r\n\r\nFirst, with regard to the nature of the materials which Mother Earth\r\nuses to build her rocky ramparts: they are the same as the ordinary\r\nrocks of which the earth's crust is composed; and the greater part of\r\nthem have been formed by the action of water. These are the ordinary\r\n\"stratified\" rocks, which in one form or another meet us almost\r\neverywhere, and may be said to be aqueous deposits, or sediments\r\nformed in seas and inland lakes. They are always arranged in layers,\r\nknown to geologists as \"strata,\" because they have been gently laid\r\ndown, or strewn (Latin, _stratum_), at the bottom of some large body\r\nof water. There were pauses in the deposition of the materials,\r\nduring which each layer had time to harden a little before the next\r\none was formed. This accounts for the stratification. In this way\r\ngreat deposits of sandstone, clay, and limestone, with their numerous\r\nvarieties, have been in the course of ages gradually piled up, till\r\nthey have attained to enormous thickness, which at first sight seem\r\nalmost incredible; but the bed of the seas in which they formed was\r\nprobably undergoing a slow sinking process that kept pace with the\r\ngrowth of these deposits, otherwise the sea might have been more or\r\nless filled up.\r\n\r\nAnd these processes are still going on. In fact, it is entirely by\r\nwatching what goes on now that geologists are able to explain what\r\ntook place a very long time ago when there were no human beings on\r\nthe earth to record the events that took place. And so we argue\r\nfrom the present to the past, from the known to the unknown. In\r\nother words, geology is based upon physical geography, which tells\r\nus of the changes now in progress on the earth. Thus, sandstone,\r\nas frequently met with in different parts of Great Britain, and\r\nlargely used for building purposes, such as the familiar old red\r\nsandstone[20] of South Wales, Hereford, and the north of England and\r\ndifferent parts of Scotland, was once soft sand in no way at all\r\ndifferent from the sand of the seashore at the present day, or of the\r\nsandy bed of the North Sea. In process of time it became hardened,\r\nand acquired its characteristic red colour, which is due to oxide of\r\niron. In some places numerous fossil fishes have been discovered in\r\nthis interesting formation, so intimately associated with the name\r\nof Hugh Miller, who first thoroughly explored it; these and other\r\nremains entombed therein tell us of the strange forms of life which\r\nflourished on the earth during that very old-fashioned period of\r\nthe world's history; and by putting together all kinds of evidences\r\nderived from the rock itself, geologists are able to form a very good\r\nidea of the way in which this rock-deposit was accumulated, always,\r\nhowever, basing their conclusions on a thorough knowledge of what\r\ngoes on at the present day in seas, rivers, and inland lakes.\r\n\r\n  [20] The reader will find an account of the old red sandstone in\r\n  the writer's \"Autobiography of the Earth\" (Edward Stanford, 1890).\r\n\r\nIn the great series of stratified rocks forming what is commonly\r\ncalled the crust of the earth (an unfortunate term which has survived\r\nfrom the time when the interior of the earth was generally believed\r\nto be in a fiery molten condition, and covered by a thin coating of\r\nsolid rock at the surface), there are besides the sandstones, of\r\nwhich we have just spoken, great deposits of dark-coloured clays,\r\nshales, and slates. All these can be accounted for by the geologist.\r\nThey are simply different states of what was once soft mud. The\r\nslates tell us that they have been subjected to very severe pressure,\r\nwhich squeezed their particles till they were elongated and all\r\narranged in one direction, and this is the reason why they split up\r\ninto thin sheets.\r\n\r\nOthers, again, represent vast deposits of carbonate of lime,\r\nthousands of feet thick and now occupying hundreds of square miles\r\nof the earth's surface. Limestone rocks are as abundant in our own\r\ncountry as the sandstones, shales, or slates. The chalk of which\r\nthe North and South Downs are composed is a familiar example. It is\r\nseen again forming Salisbury Plain, in Hampshire and the Isle of\r\nWight, and then it may be traced running up the country in a long\r\nband through the counties of Oxford, Cambridge, Lincoln, until it\r\nreaches the coast at Flamborough Head in Yorkshire. Then we have the\r\nBath Oölites so much used in building, for they form an admirable\r\n\"freestone\" that can be easily carved and cut in any direction (hence\r\nthe term \"freestone\"); and lastly, the great mountain limestone so\r\nwell developed in South Wales, Yorkshire, and the Lake country. All\r\nthese were slowly built up at the bottom of the seas which existed\r\nin past ages; great beds of gravel formed at the mouths of rivers,\r\nand long banks of pebbles and rounded stones collected on the shore\r\nof primeval seas, and were ground against each other as now by\r\nthe action of the waves, until all their corners were rubbed off.\r\nPebble-beds, called by geologists conglomerates, are met with among\r\nthe stratified rocks; and their story is easily read by studying\r\nwhat takes place at the present day on our seashores.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CHALK ROCKS, FLAMBOROUGH HEAD. FROM A PHOTOGRAPH\r\n  BY G. W. WILSON.]\r\n\r\nNow, the sandstones, clays, gravels, and pebble-beds all represent,\r\nas will presently be explained, so much material worn away from the\r\nsurface of the land and swept into the ocean (or in some cases into\r\ninland seas and lakes) by streams and rivers, which are the great\r\ntransporting agents of the world. Hence such deposits of débris,\r\nsupplied by the constant wear and tear of all rocks exposed to the\r\natmosphere, are truly sedimentary and have a purely mechanical\r\norigin. But it is not so with the limestones. The latter were never\r\ntransported, but grew at the bottom of the sea in very wonderful\r\nways. They have nothing to do with the wear and tear of the land to\r\nwhich the others owe their existence, but represent vast quantities\r\nof carbonate of lime extracted from sea water. Sea water contains\r\na certain amount of this substance in a dissolved state, or \"in\r\nsolution,\" as a chemist would say; and the way in which this is\r\nextracted by the agency of various creatures, such as coral polypes\r\nand little microscopic creatures that build their shells of\r\ncarbonate of lime, of great beauty, forms one of the most interesting\r\nsubjects presented to the student of physical geography. Hence,\r\nsince limestone can only be accounted for by the agency of living\r\norganisms,[21] it is rightly termed an _organic deposit_, and the\r\nothers are said to be _mechanical deposits_. But both are called\r\n\"aqueous rocks,\" because they are formed under water. It is important\r\nto distinguish clearly between these two very different methods of\r\nrock-formation.\r\n\r\n  [21] The flints usually found in limestone are also of organic\r\n  origin.\r\n\r\nBut although water plays such a very important part in the making of\r\nthe common rocks around us, yet there are others which have quite a\r\ndifferent origin,--rocks which have come up from below the surface of\r\nthe earth in a heated and molten condition, such as the lavas that\r\nflow from volcanoes in active eruptions and the showers of ashes\r\nand fine volcanic dust which often attend such eruptions (see chap.\r\nviii., pp. 271-272). Some highly heated rocks, though they never rise\r\nto the surface to form lava-flows, are forced up with overwhelming\r\npressure from below, and wedge themselves into the sedimentary rocks\r\nthat overlie them, thus forming what are known as volcanic dykes, and\r\nintrusive masses or sheets of once molten rock. In this category we\r\ninclude such rocks as basalt, felstone, pitchstone, and other rocks\r\nof fiery origin that have flowed from volcanoes as lava, as well as\r\nthose like granite, which have cooled and become solid _below_ the\r\nsurface, and are Plutonic, or deep-seated, igneous rocks. Granite\r\nmay be exposed to the surface of the earth when the rocks which once\r\noverlaid it have been worn away or \"denuded.\" It is frequently seen\r\nin the central regions of mountain-chains, where a vast amount of\r\nerosion has been effected. Thus we see that heat has played its part\r\nin the making of rocks; and for this reason such rocks as we have\r\njust mentioned are called _igneous_. Fire and water are therefore\r\nvery important geological agents; but we should say heat rather than\r\nfire, because the latter word might convey a false impression. No\r\nrocks can be burned except coal, which may be considered rather as a\r\nmineral deposit than as a rock. Some rocks may be heated, and undergo\r\nmany and various changes in their mineral composition; but they are\r\nnot capable of combustion.\r\n\r\nSo far, then, we have learned that the rocks exposed to view on\r\nthe surface of the earth may be divided into two classes; that is,\r\naqueous and igneous. There is yet a third class, which, though of\r\naqueous origin, has in course of time suffered considerable from\r\nthe internal heat of the earth and the enormous pressure due to the\r\nweight of overlying rocks. Such rocks have been greatly changed\r\nfrom their original condition, both in appearance and in mineral\r\ncomposition, and are said to be \"metamorphic,\" a word which implies\r\nchange. Thus chalk, or other limestone rock, has been metamorphosed\r\ninto marble; shales and slates into various kinds of \"schists,\"[22]\r\nsuch as mica-schist, and even into gneiss, which closely resembles\r\ngranite. And it is quite possible that even granite may in some cases\r\nbe the result of the melting and consolidation under great pressure\r\nof certain familiar stratified rocks. It is quite conceivable that\r\nslate might be converted into granite, for their chemical composition\r\nis similar, only the minerals of which it is composed would require\r\nto be rearranged and grouped into new compounds. This would seem\r\nquite possible; but at present we have no direct proof of such a\r\nchange having taken place. Even igneous rocks are found in some\r\nplaces to have suffered very considerable change.\r\n\r\n  [22] Schists are so named from their property of splitting into\r\n  thin layers. Their structure is crystalline; and the layers, or\r\n  folia, consist usually of two or more minerals, but sometimes\r\n  of only one. Thus mica-schist consists of quartz and mica, each\r\n  arranged in many folia, but it splits along the layers of mica.\r\n\r\nIn some inland seas, like the Caspian Sea, deposits of rock salt and\r\ngypsum may be formed by chemical precipitation, owing to evaporation\r\nfrom the surface.\r\n\r\nThe various kinds of rock known to geologists may be conveniently\r\narranged as follows:\r\n\r\n                    {                 { Clay, shale, slate, etc.\r\n                    { I.

We must now consider the question of rock-making more closely,\r\nand see what we can learn about the wonderful ways in which rocks are\r\nmade; and it may be instructive to glance at the conflicting opinions\r\non this subject which learned men held not very long ago.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the last century a great controversy took place on\r\nthe question of the origin of rocks, and the learned men of the day\r\nwere divided into two parties. One of these parties, following the\r\nteaching of Werner, professor of mining at Freyburg, who inspired\r\ngreat enthusiasm among his disciples, declared that all rocks were\r\nformed by the agency of water. This was a very sweeping and of course\r\nrash conclusion. But whenever they examined rocks, they found so many\r\nclear evidences of the action of water that a powerful impression\r\nof the importance of this agency was naturally made on their minds.\r\nThey found rocks uniformly arranged in great layers which extended\r\nfor long distances, and containing the remains of animals which must\r\nundoubtedly have lived in the seas or estuaries. These layers were\r\nfurther divided into smaller layers, such as clearly were formed\r\nby the slow settling down of sand and mud. Others again contained\r\ngravels and rounded pebbles, testifying in no uncertain way to\r\nthe action of water. Even the little grains of sand are obviously\r\nwater-worn. This teaching was quite sound so long as they confined\r\ntheir attention to clays, sandstones, and limestones; but when they\r\ncame to basalt and granite, a blind adherence to the views of their\r\nmaster caused them to shut their eyes to the clear evidences of the\r\naction of heat, presented by such rocks. The crystalline structure\r\nof such rocks; their irregular arrangement, often so different\r\nfrom the uniform disposition of the stratified rocks (although it\r\nmust be admitted that ancient lava-flows often lie very evenly\r\nbetween aqueous rocks), and the way in which they burst through\r\noverlying rocks, thus proving their former molten condition; the\r\nsigns of alteration exhibited in the aqueous rocks into which they\r\nintruded themselves (changes which are obviously due to the action\r\nof heat),--these and other evidences were entirely overlooked, and\r\nWerner declared that basalt had been found as a sediment under water.\r\n\r\nThis school of geologists, believing so strongly in the all-powerful\r\ninfluence of Father Neptune, received the not inappropriate title of\r\n\"Neptunists.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the party who happened to be in districts where\r\ngranite, basalt, and such igneous rocks abounded were equally\r\nimpressed with the importance of the powerful agency of heat. To\r\nthem nearly every rock they met with seemed to show some signs of\r\nits action. And since Pluto was the classical deity of the lower\r\nregions, and the earth shows evidences in places of greater heat\r\nbelow the surface, this party received the title of \"Plutonists;\"\r\nand so the battle raged hotly for some time between the Neptunists,\r\nwith their claims for cold water, and the fiery Plutonists of the\r\nrival school of Edinburgh, with their subterranean heat. Fire and\r\nwater are never likely to agree; and they did not do so in this case.\r\nBut now that the battle is over, and both sides are found to have\r\nbeen partly right and partly wrong,--though the Neptunists have the\r\nadvantage,--we can afford to smile at the fierceness of the contest,\r\nand wonder how it was that each side thought they were so entirely in\r\nthe right.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the aqueous rocks, and see if we can gain a clear\r\nidea of the ways in which they were formed; and first, we will take\r\nthose of a purely sedimentary origin,--the sandstones, pebble-beds,\r\ngravels, and clays. These, as the reader has already probably\r\nguessed, have all been transported by means of streams and rivers,\r\nand settled down quietly in seas at the mouths of rivers or in inland\r\nlakes. There is no trace of the action of heat in the forming of\r\nthese rocks, though they often show signs of having suffered more or\r\nless change from contact with highly heated igneous rocks of later\r\ndate which forcibly intruded themselves from below; and if the change\r\nthus effected were considerable, we should call the rocks so altered\r\nmetamorphic. But we are now dealing with their original state and how\r\nthey were made; and of that there is no possible doubt whatever. So\r\nfor the time being we may call ourselves Neptunists.\r\n\r\nStreams and rivers are the great transporting agents whereby the\r\nnever-failing supply of débris from the waste of the land is\r\nunceasingly brought down from the mountains and hills, through the\r\nbroad valleys and along the great plains, until finally it is flung\r\ninto the sea. The sea is the workshop where all the sedimentary\r\nrocks are slowly manufactured from the raw material brought to it\r\nby the rivers. But for the present we must confine our attention to\r\nthe question of transport. Referring back to our illustration of the\r\ncathedral, we may say that streams and rivers play the part of cart\r\nand horses. They bring the materials down from the quarry to the\r\nscene of action,--the workshop where they are wanted. The quarries,\r\nin this case, may be said to be almost everywhere. For wherever rocks\r\nand soil are exposed to the action of wind and weather, there is\r\ncertain to be more or less decay and crumbling away. But it is among\r\nthe hills and in the higher parts of the mountains that the forces\r\nof destruction are most active. How this is brought about will be\r\ndiscussed in the seventh chapter, on the carving of the hills. The\r\nfrequent slopes covered with loose stones are sufficient evidence of\r\nthe continual destruction that takes place in these regions.\r\n\r\nThe transporting powers of rivers are truly prodigious. Looking at\r\na stream or river after heavy rain, we see its waters heavily laden\r\nwith mud and sand; but it is difficult to realise from a casual\r\nglance the vast amount of material that is thus brought down to lower\r\nlevels. If we could trace the sediment to its source, we must seek it\r\namong the rocks of mountains far away. Step by step we may trace it\r\nup along the higher courses of the river, then along mountain streams\r\nrushing over their rocky beds, tumbling in cascades over broken\r\nrocks, or leaping in waterfalls over higher projections of rock,\r\nuntil we come to the deep furrows on the sides of mountains along\r\nwhich loose fragments of rock come tumbling down with the cascades of\r\nwater that run along these steep channels after heavy rain, leaving\r\nat the base of the mountain great fan-shaped heaps of stones.\r\n\r\n    \"Oft both slope and hill are torn\r\n    Where wintry torrents down have borne,\r\n    And heaped upon the cumbered land\r\n    Its wreck of gravel, rocks, and sand.\"\r\n\r\nThese accumulations are gradually carried away by the larger mountain\r\nstreams, which in hurrying them along cause a vast amount of wear\r\nand tear; so that their corners are worn off, and they get further\r\nand further reduced in size, becoming mere round pebbles lining\r\nthe bed of the stream, and finally by the time they reach the large\r\nslow-moving rivers of the plains are mainly reduced to tiny specks\r\nof mud or grains of sand. So then the rivers and streams not only\r\ntransport sediment, but they manufacture it as they go along. And\r\nthus they may be considered as great grinding-mills, where large\r\npieces of stone go in at one end, and only fine sand and mud come out\r\nat the other.\r\n\r\nThe amount of land débris thus transported depends partly on the\r\ncarrying power of rivers, which varies with the seasons and the\r\nannual rainfall; partly on the size of the area drained by a river;\r\nand again, partly on the nature of the rocks of which that area is\r\ncomposed.\r\n\r\nA stream, moving along at the rate of about half a mile (880 yards)\r\nan hour, which is a slow, rate, can carry along ordinary sandy soil\r\nsuspended in a cloud-like fashion in the water; when moving at the\r\nrate of two thirds of a mile (about 1,173 yards) an hour, it can roll\r\nfine gravel along its bed; but when the rate increases to a yard\r\nin a second, or a little more than two miles an hour, it can sweep\r\nalong angular stones as large as an egg. But streams often flow much\r\nfaster than this, and so do rivers when swollen by heavy rain.\r\n\r\nA rapid torrent often flows at the rate of eighteen or twenty miles\r\nan hour, and then we may hear the stones rattling against each other\r\nas they are irresistibly rolled onward; and during very heavy floods,\r\nhuge masses of rock as large as a house have been known to be moved.\r\n\r\nThese are the two principal ways in which streams and rivers act as\r\ntransporting agents: they carry the finer materials in a suspended\r\nstate (though partly drifting it along their beds); and they push\r\nthe coarser materials, such as gravel, bodily along. But there\r\nis one other way in which they carry on the important work of\r\ntransportation, which, being unseen, might easily escape our notice.\r\nEvery spring is busily employed in bringing up to the surface mineral\r\nsubstances which the water has dissolved out of the underground\r\nrocks. This invisible material finds its way, as the springs do, to\r\nthe rivers, and so finally is brought into that great reservoir, the\r\nsea. Rain and river water also dissolve a certain amount of mineral\r\nmatter from rocks lying on the surface of the earth. Now, the\r\nmaterial which is most easily dissolved is carbonate of lime. Hence\r\nif you take a small quantity of spring or river water and boil it\r\nuntil the whole is evaporated, you will find that it leaves behind\r\na certain amount of deposit. This, when analysed by the chemist,\r\nproves to be chiefly carbonate of lime; but it also contains minute\r\nquantities of other minerals, such as common salt, potash, soda,\r\noxide of iron, and silica, or flint. All these and other minerals are\r\nfound to be present in sea water.\r\n\r\nThe waters of some of the great rivers of the world have been\r\ncarefully examined at different times, in order to form some idea of\r\nthe amount of solid matter which they contain, both dissolved and\r\nsuspended; and the results are extremely important and interesting,\r\nfor they enable us to form definite conclusions with regard to their\r\ncapacity for transport. This subject has been investigated with great\r\nskill by eminent men of science. The problem is a very complicated\r\none; but it is easy to see that if we know roughly the number of\r\ngallons of water annually discharged into the sea by a big river,\r\nand the average amount of solid matter contained in such a gallon\r\nof water, we have the means of calculating, by a simple process\r\nof multiplication, the amount of solid matter annually brought\r\ndown to the sea by that river. But we must also add the amount of\r\nsand, gravel, and stones pushed along its bed. This may be roughly\r\nestimated and allowed for. These are some of the results:\r\n\r\nThe amount of solid matter discharged every year by that great river,\r\nthe Mississippi, if piled up on a single square mile of the bed of\r\nthe sea,--say, in the Gulf of Mexico, where that river discharges\r\nitself,--would make a great square-shaped pile 268 feet high. But the\r\nGulf Stream, sweeping through this gulf, carries the materials for\r\nmany and many a mile away; so that in course of time it gradually\r\nsinks and spreads itself as a fine film or layer over part of the\r\ngreat Atlantic Ocean. The mud brought down by the great river\r\nAmazon spreads so far into the Atlantic Ocean as to discolour the\r\nwater even at a distance of three hundred miles. The Ganges and the\r\nBrahmapootra, flowing into the Bay of Bengal, discharge every year\r\ninto that part of the Indian Ocean 6,368,000,000 cubic feet of solid\r\nmatter. This material would in one year raise a space of fifteen\r\nsquare miles one foot in height. The weight of mud, etc., that these\r\nrivers bring down is sixty times that of the Great Pyramid of Egypt,\r\nor about six million tons.\r\n\r\nOr, to put the matter in another way, if a fleet of more than eighty\r\n\"Indiamen,\" each with a cargo of fourteen hundred tons of solid\r\nmatter, sailed down every hour, night and day, for four months, and\r\ndischarged their burdens into the waters of the Indian Ocean, they\r\nwould only do what the mighty Ganges does quietly and easily in the\r\nfour months of the flood season.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that even the Thames, a small river compared to\r\nthose just mentioned, manages to bring down, in one way or another,\r\nfourteen million cubic feet of solid matter. These few figures may\r\nsuffice to give the reader some idea of the enormous amount of\r\nrock-forming materials brought down to the seas at the present day.\r\n\r\nOf course they are spread out far and wide by the numerous ocean\r\ncurrents, some of which flow for hundreds of miles; and so the bed of\r\nthe sea can only be very slowly raised by their accumulation. Still\r\nthe geologist can allow plenty of time, for there is no doubt that\r\nthe world is immensely old; and if we allow thousands of years, we\r\nmay easily comprehend that deposits of very considerable thickness\r\nmay in this way accumulate on the floors of the oceans. Also the\r\ncoasts of continents and islands suffer continual wear and tear at\r\nthe hands of sea waves; and thus the supply of sediment is increased.\r\n\r\nWhen the geologist comes to study the great rock-masses--hundreds,\r\nand even thousands, of feet in thickness--of which mountain-ranges\r\nare composed, he finds all those kinds of rock which we have\r\njust been considering,--sandstones, shales (or hardened clays),\r\npebble-beds, and limestones,--and endeavours to picture to himself\r\ntheir gradual growth in the ways we have described. In so doing, he\r\nis driven to the conclusion that many thousands of years must have\r\nbeen occupied in their construction.\r\n\r\nWe must now say a few words about those other aqueous rocks which\r\nhave an organic origin, of which limestone is the chief. It is indeed\r\na startling conclusion that deposits of great thickness, and ranging\r\nfor very many miles over the earth's surface, have been slowly built\r\nup through the agency of marine animals extracting carbonate of lime\r\nfrom the sea. Yet such is undoubtedly the case. Of this important\r\nprocess of rock-building coral reefs are the most familiar example.\r\nThe great barrier reef along the northeast coast of Australia is\r\nabout 1,250 miles long, from ten to ninety miles in width, and rises\r\nat its seaward edge from depths which in some places certainly exceed\r\neighteen hundred feet. It may be likened to a great submarine wall.\r\nNow, all this solid masonry is the work of humble coral polypes (not\r\n\"insects\"), building up their own internal framework or skeleton\r\nby extracting carbonate of lime from sea water. Then the breakers\r\ndashing against coral reefs produce, by their grinding action, a\r\ngreat deal of fine \"coral-sand\" and calcareous mud, which covers the\r\nsurrounding bed of the sea for many miles.\r\n\r\nNow, geologists find that some limestone formations met with in the\r\nstratified rocks have certainly been formed in this way; for example,\r\ncertain parts of the great \"mountain limestone.\" This is proved by\r\nthe fossil corals it contains, and by tracing the old coral reefs;\r\nbut it is also largely formed by the remains of other graceful\r\ncalcareous creatures known as encrinites, or \"sea-lilies,\" with long\r\nbranching arms that waved in the clear water. Such creatures still\r\nexist in some deeper parts of the sea, and look more like plants\r\nthan animals. In former ages they existed in great abundance, and so\r\nplayed an important part as rock-formers,--for their stems, branches,\r\nand all are made of little plates of carbonate of lime, beautifully\r\nfitting together like the separate bones, or vertebræ, composing\r\nthe backbone of a fish; and when the creatures died, these little\r\nplates no longer held together, but were scattered on the floor\r\nof the sea-bed. Shell-fish abounded too, and their shelly remains\r\naccumulated into regular shell-beds in some places. But at times mud\r\nand sand would come and cover over all these organic deposits.\r\n\r\nBut of all rocks that have an organic origin, chalk is the most\r\ninteresting. Geologists were for a long time puzzled to know how this\r\nrock could have been formed; but some soundings made in the Atlantic\r\nOcean previous to the laying of the first Atlantic cable led to a\r\nvery important discovery, which at once threw a flood of light on\r\nthe question. Samples of the mud lying on the bed of this ocean at\r\nconsiderable distances from the European and American coasts, and\r\nat depths varying from one thousand to three thousand fathoms, were\r\nbrought up by sounding apparatus.\r\n\r\nLittle was it thought that the dull grey ooze covering a large part\r\nof the Atlantic bed would bring a message from the depths of the sea,\r\nand furnish the answer to a great geological problem. Yet such was\r\nthe case; for under the microscope this mud was seen to be chiefly\r\ncomposed of very minute and very beautiful shells, now known as\r\n_foraminifera_, and much prized by microscopists. These tiny shells\r\nare found at or near the surface of the sea; and after the death of\r\nthe creatures that inhabit them (which are only lumps of protoplasm\r\nwith no organs of any kind), the shells slowly sink down to the bed\r\nof the ocean. Now, these creatures multiply at so inconceivable a\r\nrate that a continuous shower of dead shells seems to be taking\r\nplace, and the result is the slow accumulation over vast areas of the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific oceans of a great deposit of calcareous ooze,\r\nwhich if raised above the sea-level would harden into a rock very\r\nsimilar to chalk.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MICROPHOTOGRAPHS ILLUSTRATING ROCK FORMATION.\r\n\r\n  I. Foraminifera. II. Section of Granite. III. Nummulitic\r\n  Limestone.]\r\n\r\nBut this process only takes place in the deeper parts of our seas,\r\nfar removed from land, where the supply of land-derived materials\r\nfails,--for even the finest mud supplied by rivers probably all\r\nsettles down before travelling two or three hundred miles from its\r\nnative shores.\r\n\r\nThus we learn that when one agency fails, Nature makes use of another\r\nto take up the important work of rock-building. How the other rocks\r\nwhich we mentioned in our list were formed,--such as granite, basalt,\r\nand the metamorphic rocks,--we must explain in a future chapter\r\ndealing with volcanoes and their work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nHOW THE MOUNTAINS WERE UPHEAVED.\r\n\r\n   The notion that the ground is naturally steadfast is an\r\n   error,--an error which arises from the incapacity of our senses\r\n   to appreciate any but the most palpable, and at the same time\r\n   most exceptional, of its movements. The idea of _terra firma_\r\n   belongs with the ancient belief that the earth was the centre\r\n   of the universe. It is, indeed, by their mobility that the\r\n   continents survive the increasing assaults of the ocean waves,\r\n   and the continuous down-wearing which the rivers and glaciers\r\n   bring about.--PROFESSOR SHALER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have found out the quarries which supplied the rocky framework of\r\nmountains, and have learned how the work of transporting these vast\r\nquantities of stone was accomplished by the agency of ever-flowing\r\nglaciers, rivers, and streams.\r\n\r\nWe must now consider the second stage of the work, and inquire how\r\nthe mountains were raised up. Referring back to our illustration\r\nof the cathedral (see pages 143-147), it will be remembered that\r\nthis work was included under the head of _Elevation_. But perhaps\r\nsome one might ask: \"How do you know that the mountains have been\r\nelevated or upheaved? Is it not enough to suppose that they owe their\r\nheight entirely to the fact that they are composed of harder rock,\r\nand so have been more successful in resisting the universal decay and\r\ndestruction?\" Now, such an objection contains a good deal of truth,\r\nfor mountains _are_ formed of hard rocks; but at the same time we\r\nknow that the agents of denudation are more active among them than on\r\nthe plains below, so that, in the higher mountain regions at least,\r\nthe work of demolition may actually proceed faster than it does on\r\nlow ground.\r\n\r\nMountains are higher than the rest of the world, not merely because\r\nthey are built of more lasting material, but also because they have\r\nbeen uplifted for thousands of feet above the level of the sea; and\r\nthe evidence of their upheaval is so plain as to be entirely beyond\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nLet us inquire into the nature of this evidence. We have seen that\r\nthe rocks of which mountains are composed were for the most part\r\nformed at the bottom of the sea. When the geologist finds, as he\r\nfrequently does, buried in mountain rocks the fossil remains of\r\ncreatures that must have lived in the sea (and often very similar to\r\nthose living there now), he is compelled to think of the gigantic\r\nupheavals that must have taken place before those remains could\r\narrive at their present elevated position.\r\n\r\nNumerous examples might be given; but we will only mention three. In\r\nthe Alps marine fossils have been detected at a height of 10,000 feet\r\nabove sea-level, in the Himalayas at a height of 16,500 feet, and in\r\nthe Rocky Mountains at a height of 11,000 feet.\r\n\r\nAgain we must take it for granted that all the stratified or\r\nsedimentary rocks (see pages 148-149) with some trivial exceptions,\r\nsuch as beds of shingle and conglomerates, have been formed in\r\nhorizontal layers. This is one of the simple axioms of geology to\r\nwhich every one must assent.\r\n\r\nNow, if we find in various parts of the continents, and especially\r\namong the mountains, such strata sloping or \"dipping\" in\r\nvarious directions, sometimes only slightly, but sometimes very\r\nsteeply,--nay, even standing up on end,--the conclusion that they\r\nhave been upheaved and pushed or squeezed into these various\r\npositions by some subsequent process is irresistible. But this is\r\nnot all; for in every mountain region we find that the rocks have\r\nbeen crumpled, twisted, and folded in a most marvellous manner. Solid\r\nsheets of limestone may be seen, as it were, to writhe from the\r\nbase to the summit of a mountain; yet they present everywhere their\r\ntruncated ends to the air, and from their incompleteness it is easy\r\nto see what a vast amount of material has been worn away, leaving,\r\nas it were, mere fragments behind. The whole geological aspect of\r\nthe Alps (for example) is suggestive of intense commotion; and they\r\nremain a marvellous monument of stupendous earth-throes, followed by\r\nprolonged and gigantic denudation (see diagrams, chap. ix., p. 307).\r\n\r\nThere are certain features found in all mountain-chains which must\r\nbe carefully borne in mind, especially when we are considering the\r\nexplanations that have been suggested with regard to their upheaval.\r\nThese may be briefly stated as follows:--\r\n\r\n   1. Mountain-chains tend to run in straight or gently curving\r\n   lines.\r\n\r\n   2. Their breadth is small compared to their length, and their\r\n   height smaller still.\r\n\r\n   3. They rise sharply and are clearly marked off from the\r\n   country on either side.\r\n\r\n   4. They form the backbones of continents.\r\n\r\n   5. The rocks of which they are composed have been greatly\r\n   disturbed, folded, and contorted.\r\n\r\n   6. There is often a band of crystalline rocks (granite, gneiss,\r\n   etc.) running along the centre of a high range.\r\n\r\n   7. They are connected with lines of volcanoes.\r\n\r\n   8. They are frequently affected by earthquakes.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at the conclusion that the mountains show evident\r\nsigns of upheaval, let us proceed to inquire whether any movements,\r\neither upward or downward, are taking place now on the earth, or can\r\nbe proved to have done so within comparatively recent times. On this\r\nquestion there is ample evidence at our disposal.\r\n\r\nMore than one hundred and thirty years ago, Celsius, the Swedish\r\nastronomer, was aware, from the unanimous testimony of the\r\ninhabitants of the sea-coasts, that the Gulf of Bothnia was\r\nconstantly diminishing both in depth and extent. He resorted to\r\nmeasurements in order to prove (as he thought) that the waters of\r\nthe Baltic were changing their level. This was a mistaken idea; and\r\nwe now understand that the level of the sea does not change, except\r\nunder the influence of the daily rise and fall of the tide, which is\r\neasily allowed for. However, that was the idea then; and it survived\r\nfor some time. But if the sea-level were continually sinking, the\r\nwater, which, owing to the influence of gravitation, must always\r\nremain horizontal, would equally retreat all round the Scandinavian\r\npeninsula and on all our seashores. But this is not the case. Again,\r\nit would be impossible on this theory to explain the curious fact\r\nthat in some parts of the world the sea is gaining on the land, while\r\nin other places it is as surely retreating; for we cannot believe\r\nthat in one part the sea-level is rising, while in another (not far\r\noff in some cases) it is sinking. No body of water could behave in\r\nthis irregular fashion; and the sea could not possibly be rising and\r\nfalling at the same time.\r\n\r\nHence we may take it for granted that any change that we may notice\r\nin the relative level of land and sea _must_ be due to upward or\r\ndownward movements in the land.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Celsius. Old men pointed out to him various points\r\non the coast, over which during their childhood the sea was wont to\r\nflow, and besides, showed him the water-lines which the waves had\r\nonce traced out farther inland. And besides this, the names of places\r\nwhich implied a position on the shore, former harbours or ports now\r\nabandoned and situated inland, the remains of boats found far from\r\nthe sea, and lastly, the written records and popular songs, left no\r\ndoubt that the sea had retreated; and it seemed both to themselves\r\nand to the astronomer that the waters were sinking. In the year 1730\r\nCelsius, after comparing all the evidence he had collected, announced\r\nthat the Baltic had sunk three feet, four inches, every hundred\r\nyears. In the course of the following year, in company with Linnæus,\r\nthe naturalist, he made a mark at the base of a rock in the island\r\nof Leoffgrund, not far from Jelfe, and thirteen years afterwards was\r\nable to prove, as he thought, that the waters were still subsiding\r\nat the same rate, or a little faster. In reality, he had proved, not\r\nthat the sea was sinking, but that the land was rising.\r\n\r\nSimilar observations show that nearly the whole of Scandinavia is\r\nslowly rising out of the sea. At the northern end of the Gulf of\r\nBothnia the land is emerging at the rate of five feet, three inches,\r\nin a century; but by the side of the Aland Isles it only rises three\r\nand one quarter feet in the same time. South of this archipelago it\r\nrises still more slowly; and farther down, the line of shore does not\r\nalter as compared with the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nBut it is a curious fact that the extreme southern end of this\r\npeninsula is subsiding, as proved by the forests that have been\r\nsubmerged. Several streets of some towns there have already\r\ndisappeared, and the coast has lost on the average a belt of land\r\nthirty-two yards in breadth.\r\n\r\nThe upward movement of the Scandinavian peninsula must have been\r\ngoing on for a long time, if we assume that it was always at the same\r\nrate as at present; for we find beds of seashells of living species\r\nat heights of six or seven hundred feet above the level of the sea.\r\nGreat dead branches of a certain pink coral, found in the sea at a\r\ndepth of over one hundred and fifty to three hundred fathoms, are\r\nnow seen in water only ten or fifteen fathoms deep. It must have\r\nbeen killed as it was brought up into the upper and warmer layers of\r\nwater. This is striking testimony.\r\n\r\nThe pine woods too, which clothe the hills, are continually being\r\nupheaved towards the lower limit of snow, and are gradually withering\r\naway in the cooler atmosphere; and wide belts of forest are composed\r\nof nothing but dead trees, although some of them have stood for\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nGeologists have proved that the Baltic Sea formerly communicated\r\nby a wide channel with the North Sea, the deepest depressions of\r\nwhich are now occupied by lakes in the southern part of Sweden; for\r\nconsiderable heaps of oyster-shells are now found in several places\r\non the heights commanding these great lakes. Then we have in Denmark\r\nthe celebrated \"kitchen-middens,\" heaps of rubbish also largely\r\ncomposed of oyster-shells which the inhabitants, in the \"Stone\r\nAge,\" collected from the bottoms of the neighbouring bays. At the\r\npresent day the waters of the Baltic, into which rivers bring large\r\nquantities of fresh water, do not contain enough salt for oysters to\r\ngrow there; but the oyster-shells prove that the Baltic Sea and these\r\ninland lakes were once as salt as the North Sea is now. This can only\r\nbe explained by supposing that the Baltic was not so shut in then as\r\nit is in these days. The bed of the old wide channel has risen, and\r\nwhat once was sea is now land.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is very probable that the great lakes and innumerable\r\nsheets of water which fill all the granite basins of Finland have\r\ntaken the place of an arm of the sea which once united the waters of\r\nthe Baltic to those of the great Polar Ocean. And so there must have\r\nbeen upheaval here as well.\r\n\r\nThe old sea-beaches, now above the level of the highest tides, that\r\nare found in many parts of the Scandinavian, Scottish, and other\r\ncoasts, furnish plain evidence of upheaval.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, between the lines of high tide and low tide, the\r\nsea is constantly engaged in producing sand and shingle, spreading\r\nthem out upon the beach, mingling them with the remains of shells\r\nand other marine animals, and sometimes piling them up, sometimes\r\nsweeping them away. In this way a beach often resembles a terrace.\r\nWhen the land is upheaved rapidly enough to carry up this line\r\nof beach-deposits before they are washed away by the waves, they\r\nform a flat terrace, or what is known as a \"raised beach.\" The old\r\nhigh-water mark is then inland; its sea-worn caves become in time\r\ncoated with ferns and mosses; the old beach forms an admirable\r\nplatform on which meadows, fields, villages, and towns spring up; and\r\nthe sea goes on forming a new beach below and beyond the margin of\r\nthe old one.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish coast-line, on both sides, is fringed with raised\r\nbeaches, sometimes four or five occurring above each other, at\r\nheights of from twenty-five to seventy-five feet above the present\r\nhigh-water mark. Each of these lines of terrace marks a former lower\r\nlevel at which the land stood with regard to the sea; and the spaces\r\nbetween them represent the amount of each successive rise of the\r\nland. Each terrace was formed during a pause, or interval, in the\r\nupward movement, during which the waves had time to make a terrace,\r\nwhereas, while the land kept on rising, they had no time to do so.\r\nThus we learn that the upheaval of the country was interrupted by\r\nconsiderable pauses.\r\n\r\nSometimes old ports and harbours furnish evidence of upheaval. Thus,\r\nthe former Roman port of Alaterva (Cramond) in Scotland, the quays of\r\nwhich are still visible, is now situated at some distance from the\r\nsea, and the ground on which it stands has risen at least twenty-four\r\nfeet. In other places the scattered débris shows that the coast has\r\nrisen twenty-six feet. And by a remarkable coincidence, the ancient\r\nwall of Antoninus, which in the time of the Romans stretched from sea\r\nto sea, and served as a barrier against the Picts, comes to an end at\r\na point twenty-six feet above the level of high tides. In the estuary\r\nof the Clyde there are deposits of mud, containing rude canoes and\r\nother relics of human workmanship, several feet above the present\r\nhigh-water mark.\r\n\r\nRaised beaches are found on many parts of the coast of Great Britain.\r\nExcellent examples occur on the coasts of Devon and Cornwall. On the\r\nsides of the mountainous fiords of Norway similar terraces are found\r\nup to more than six hundred feet above the sea; and as some of these\r\nrise to a greater height at a distance of fifty miles inland, it\r\nseems that there was a greater upward movement towards the interior\r\nof Norway than on the coasts.\r\n\r\nThere is a celebrated raised beach on the side of a mountain in\r\nNorth Wales, known as Moel Tryfaen, where the writer gathered a\r\nnumber of marine shells at a height of 1,357 feet.\r\n\r\nBut Scandinavia and Great Britain are not the only parts of Europe\r\nwhere an upward movement has taken place, for the islands of Nova\r\nZembla and Spitzbergen show evidence of the same kind; and the coast\r\nof Siberia, for six hundred miles to the east of the river Lena, has\r\nalso been upraised. On the banks of the Dwina and the Vega, 250 miles\r\nto the south of the White Sea, Murchison found beds of sand and mud\r\nwith shells similar to those which inhabit the neighbouring seas, so\r\nwell preserved that they had not lost their colours.\r\n\r\nAgain, the ground of the Siberian _toundras_ is to a large extent\r\ncovered with a thin coating of sand and fine clay, exactly similar\r\nto that which is now deposited on the shores of the Frozen Ocean.\r\nIn this clay, the remains of the mammoth, or woolly elephant, now\r\nextinct, are preserved in great numbers.\r\n\r\nParts of Northern Greenland have also risen; while at the southern\r\nend of this frozen land a downward movement is still taking place.\r\n\r\nThe best-known example of these slow movements within historic times\r\nis the so-called Temple of Serapis in the Bay of Baie, near Naples.\r\nThe ruins of this building, which was probably a Roman bath, consist\r\nof a square floor paved with marble, showing that it possessed a\r\nmagnificent central court. This court, when perfect, was covered with\r\na roof supported by forty-six fine columns, some of marble, others\r\nof granite. There is still a hot spring behind, from which water was\r\nconducted through a marble channel. All the columns but three were\r\nnearly buried in the soil which covered the whole court, when the\r\nruins were first discovered. Now, each of the three marble columns\r\nthat are still standing shows clear evidence of having been depressed\r\nbelow the sea-level, for they all exhibit a circular row of little\r\nholes bored by a certain marine shell-fish, known as _Lithodomus\r\ndactylus_, at a height of twelve feet from the floor; each row is\r\nabout eight feet broad. The shells may still be seen inside the\r\nlittle pear-shaped holes which the shell-fish bored for themselves;\r\nand the same shell-fish still live in the waters of the Mediterranean\r\nand bore holes in the limestone rocks.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore quite clear that these columns must have been under\r\nwater to a depth of twenty feet or so, and also that they must have\r\nremained under water for some considerable time, during which the\r\nshell-fish made these borings. Then an upheaval took place whereby\r\nthe whole building was elevated to its present level. But underneath\r\nthe present floor, at a depth of five feet, were discovered the\r\nremains of an older floor. This probably belonged to an earlier\r\nbuilding which had in like manner been depressed below sea-level. We\r\nthus learn that the land in this spot had been sinking for a long\r\ntime, and that at some subsequent time it rose. The fallen columns\r\nsuggest the idea that they were thrown down by earthquakes. At the\r\npresent time the land here is again sinking at the rate of one inch\r\nin three or four years.\r\n\r\nBut the first example of upheaval within comparatively recent times,\r\nand one which is instructive as throwing some light on the subject of\r\nthe present chapter,--namely, the upheaval of mountain-chains,--is to\r\nbe found along the western mountainous coast of South America. Here\r\nwe have the magnificent ranges of the Andes running along the whole\r\nlength of this continent. The illustrious Charles Darwin, during\r\nhis famous trip in the \"Beagle,\" discovered numerous raised beaches\r\nalong this coast, and at once perceived their importance to the\r\ngeologist. The terraces are not quite horizontal, but rise towards\r\nthe south. On the frontier of Bolivia, they are seen at heights of\r\nfrom sixty-five to eighty feet above sea-level; but nearer the higher\r\nmass of the Chilian Andes they are found at one thousand feet, and\r\nnear Valparaiso, in Chili, at thirteen hundred feet above the sea.\r\nDarwin also discovered that some of the upheavals thus indicated took\r\nplace during the human period; for he found in one of the terraces\r\nopposite Callao, in Peru, at a height of eighty feet, shells with\r\nbones of birds, ears of wheat, plaited reeds, and cotton thread,\r\nshowing that men had lived on the terrace. These relics of human\r\nindustry are exactly similar to those that are found in the _huacas_,\r\nor burial-places, of the ancient Peruvians. There can be no doubt\r\nthat the island of San Lorenzo, and probably the whole of the coast\r\nin its neighbourhood, have risen eighty feet or more since the Red\r\nMan inhabited the country.\r\n\r\nCallao probably forms the northern limit of the long strip of coast\r\nthat has been upheaved, and the island of Chiloe the southern limit;\r\nbut even thus the region of elevation has a length from north to\r\nsouth of about 2,480 miles.\r\n\r\nWe noticed in the case of Scandinavia that the upward movement is\r\ngreater in the interior of the mountain-range than at or near the\r\ncoast; and it is interesting to find that the same difference has\r\nbeen observed in the case of the Andes. The upheaving force, whatever\r\nits nature, acts with more energy under the Chilian Andes than under\r\nthe rocks of the adjacent coast.\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand we have also evidences of upheaval; and if we trace\r\nout on the map a long line from the Friendly Isles and Fiji, through\r\nthe Eastern Archipelago, and then on through the Philippine Islands,\r\nand finally to Japan and the Kurile Islands, we shall find scattered\r\nregions of elevation all along this great line, which is probably a\r\nmountain-chain, partly submerged, and along which numerous active\r\nvolcanoes are situated.\r\n\r\nPutting together all the evidence that has been gathered on this\r\nsubject, of which only a very small part is here given, we are\r\nwarranted in concluding that taking the world generally, regions\r\nwhere active volcanoes exist are generally regions where upheaval is\r\ntaking place. There is also a very interesting connection between\r\nmountain-chains and lines of volcanic action. From this it seems to\r\nfollow, if lines of volcanic action are also lines of upheaval, that\r\nmountain-chains are undergoing upheaval at the present time. This\r\nis a conclusion in favour of which a good deal may be said. It is\r\ncertainly true in the cases of the Scandinavian range, and also of a\r\nvery large part of the Andes, to which we have already referred. The\r\nHighlands of Scotland and Scandinavia form the northern end of an old\r\nline of volcanic action running down the Atlantic Ocean through the\r\nAzores, Madeira, Cape Verde Islands, Ascension, St. Helena, right\r\ndown to Tristan d'Acunha.\r\n\r\nIn many other parts of the world we have evidences from submerged\r\nforests, the positions of certain landmarks with regard to the sea,\r\nand in some cases submerged towns, that movements of a downward\r\nnature are taking place.\r\n\r\nIt is important to distinguish from these evidences the changes that\r\ntake place where the waves of the sea are rapidly washing away the\r\ncoast-line. Putting aside these cases, however, it has been clearly\r\nproved that in many regions a slow sinking of the land is going on.\r\n\r\nThe eastern side of South America has not been so thoroughly observed\r\nas its western side; but there is still good reason to believe that\r\na large part of this coast is sinking. So it appears that a see-saw\r\nmovement is affecting South America, and that while one side is going\r\nup, the other is going down; and it is interesting to observe other\r\nexamples of the same thing,--such as are afforded by Greenland and\r\nNorway.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE SKAEGGDALFORS, NORWAY.\r\n\r\n  FROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY J. VALENTINE.]\r\n\r\nAgain, while part of Labrador is rising, parts of the eastern coast\r\nof North America, as far down as Florida, are slowly sinking. Thus\r\nalong the New England coast between New York and Maine, and again\r\nalong the Gulf of St. Lawrence, we find numerous submerged forests\r\nwith quantities of trees standing upright with their roots in old\r\nforest-beds, but with the tops of their stumps some feet below the\r\nlevel of high tide. In the case of New Jersey the subsidence is\r\nprobably taking place at the rate of two feet in a hundred years.\r\n\r\nBefore passing on to consider upward movements of a more rapid\r\nnature, such as are frequently caused by earthquakes, we may pause\r\nfor a few moments to consider certain very slight, but nevertheless\r\nvery interesting little movements, such as _slight pulsations_ and\r\ntremors, which have been observed to take place in the earth's crust\r\n(as it is called), and which of late years have been carefully\r\nstudied.\r\n\r\nProfessor Milne, a great authority on earthquakes, has noticed slight\r\nswayings of the earth, which though occupying a short time--from a\r\nfew seconds to a few hours--are still too slow to produce a shock of\r\nany kind. These he calls \"earth pulsations.\" They have been observed\r\nby means of delicate spirit-levels, the bubbles of which move with\r\nvery slight changes of level at either end of the instrument. At\r\npresent only a few experiments of this kind have been made; but they\r\ntell us that the surface of the earth (which is apparently so firm\r\nand immovable) is subject to slight but frequent oscillations. Some\r\nthink that they depend upon changes in the weight of the atmosphere.\r\nIf this is so, the balance between the forces at work below the\r\nearth's surface and those that operate on its surface must be\r\nvery easily disturbed. Still we cannot see that this is a serious\r\nobjection; on the contrary, there is much reason to think that any\r\nslight extra weight on the surface, such as might be caused by an\r\nincrease of the pressure of the atmosphere, and still more by the\r\naccumulation of vast sedimentary deposits on the floor of the ocean,\r\nmay be quite sufficient to cause a movement to take place. Moreover,\r\nMr. G. H. Darwin has shown that the earth's crust daily heaves up and\r\ndown under the attraction of the moon in the same kind of way that\r\nthe ocean does; so that we must give up all idea of the solid earth\r\nbeing fixed and immovable, and must look upon it as a flexible body,\r\nlike a ball of india-rubber (see chap. ix., pp. 314-315).\r\n\r\nSlight movements of rather a different kind have been noticed, to\r\nwhich the name of \"earth-tremors\" has been given. These are very\r\nslight jarrings or quiverings of the earth, too slight to be observed\r\nby our unaided senses, but rendered visible by means of very delicate\r\npendulums and other contrivances. Now wherever such observations\r\nhave been made it has been discovered that the earth is constantly\r\nquivering as if it were a lump of jelly. In Italy, where this subject\r\nhas been very carefully studied, the tremors that are continually\r\ngoing on are found to vary considerably in strength; for instance,\r\nwhen the weather is very disturbed and unsettled, the movements of\r\nthe pendulum are often much greater. Again, before an earthquake the\r\ninstrument shows that the tremors are more frequent and violent.\r\n\r\nAnother way of observing these curious little movements is by burying\r\nmicrophones in the ground. The microphone is a little instrument\r\ninvented of late years which is capable of enormously magnifying the\r\nvery slightest sounds, such as our ears will not detect. By its means\r\none can hear, as some one said, \"the tramp of a fly's foot,\" if he\r\nwill be so obliging as to walk over it. It has thus been proved in\r\nItaly that the earth sends forth a confused medley of sounds caused\r\nby little crackings and snappings in the rocks below our feet.\r\n\r\nIn this way it will be possible to predict a serious earthquake,\r\nbecause it will give warning some days before, by the increase of the\r\nlittle tremors and sounds; and it is to be hoped that by this simple\r\nmeans human lives may be saved.\r\n\r\nNow, these disturbances are of precisely the same nature as\r\nearthquakes,--in fact, we may call them microscopic earthquakes. To\r\nthe geologist they are of great interest, as they seem to afford\r\nsome little insight into the difficult question of the upheaval of\r\nmountains, and to show us something of the constant _working_ of\r\nthose wonderful forces below the surface of the earth by means of\r\nwhich continents are raised up out of the sea, and mountain-chains\r\nare elevated thousands of feet. It is probable that both are due to\r\nthe working of the same forces, and are accomplished by the same\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nWe now pass on to consider those more violent movements of the solid\r\nland known as earthquakes. This kind of disturbance is such as might\r\nbe produced by a sudden shock or blow given below the ground, from\r\nwhich waves travel in all directions. First comes a rumbling noise\r\nlike the roar of distant artillery; then come the earthquake waves\r\none after another, causing the ground to rise and fall as a ship does\r\non the waves of the sea; the ground is frequently rent asunder, so\r\nthat chasms are formed, into which in some cases men and animals\r\nhave been hurled alive. In the case of a very violent earthquake\r\nthe waves travel long distances. Thus the great earthquake by which\r\nLisbon was destroyed in the year 1755 disturbed the waters of Loch\r\nLomond in Scotland. In this fearful catastrophe sixty thousand human\r\nbeings perished. If the disturbance takes place near the sea, great\r\nsea waves are formed, which cause fearful destruction to life and\r\nproperty. This happened in the case of the Lisbon earthquake; and\r\nin the year 1868, when Ecuador and Peru were visited by a fearful\r\nearthquake, a great sea wave swept over the port of Arica, and in a\r\nfew minutes every vessel in the harbour was either driven ashore or\r\nwrecked, and a man-of-war was swept inland for a quarter of a mile.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes bring about many changes on the surface of the earth. For\r\nexample, on mountain-slopes forests are shattered, and large masses\r\nof soil and débris are shaken loose from the rock on which they\r\nrested, and hurled into the valleys; streams are thus choked up, and\r\nsometimes lakes formed, either by the damming up of a river or by\r\nthe subsidence of the ground.\r\n\r\nIt is frequently found after an earthquake that the level of\r\nthe ground has been permanently altered; and this effect of\r\nearthquakes is important in connection with the subject we are now\r\nconsidering,--namely, how mountains are upheaved. Sometimes, it is\r\ntrue, the movement is a downward one; but more generally it takes\r\nplace in an upward direction. As an example of this, we may mention\r\nthe Chilian earthquake of 1835, which was very violent, and destroyed\r\nseveral towns on that coast, from Copiapo to Chile. It was afterwards\r\nfound that the land in the Bay of Conception had been raised four or\r\nfive feet. At the island of Santa Maria, to the southwest of this\r\nbay, the land was raised eight feet, and in one part ten feet; for\r\nbeds of dead mussels were seen at that height above high water, and\r\na considerable rocky flat that formerly was covered by the sea now\r\nbecame dry land. It was also proved by means of soundings that the\r\nsea round the island was shallower by about nine feet.\r\n\r\nNow the question arises, \"How are earthquakes caused?\" Various\r\nsuggestions have been made; but it is pretty clear that all\r\nearthquakes are not produced in the same way. For instance, volcanic\r\neruptions are frequently attended by earthquakes. Violent shocks of\r\nthis nature generally precede and accompany a great eruption, as is\r\nfrequently the case before an eruption of Mount Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nSteam plays a very important part in all volcanic eruptions; and\r\nthese earthquakes are probably caused by great quantities of pent-up\r\nsteam at a high pressure struggling to escape. It is also possible\r\nthat when molten rock is forcibly injected into the crevices and\r\njoints of overlying rocks earthquake shocks may be produced by\r\nthe concussion. The old Roman poet and philosopher, Lucretius,\r\nendeavoured to solve this problem, and concluded that \"the shakings\r\nof the surface of the globe are occasioned by the falling in of\r\nenormous caverns which time has succeeded in destroying.\" But\r\nthough the explanation might possibly apply to a few cases of small\r\nearthquakes, it is not a satisfactory one, for it is not at all\r\nlikely that many large cavities exist below the earth's surface,\r\nbecause the great weight of the overlying rock would inevitably crush\r\nthem in.\r\n\r\nWe have already pointed out that earthquakes frequently happen in\r\nmountainous regions; and this fact alone suggests that perhaps the\r\nsame causes which upheave mountains may have something to do with\r\nearthquakes. But there are other reasons for believing that the same\r\nforce which causes earthquakes also upheaves mountain-chains. The\r\nreader will remember the case of the Chilian earthquake that raised\r\npart of the Andes a few feet in height.\r\n\r\nNow, it is quite clear that the rocks of which mountains are composed\r\nhave suffered a great deal of disturbance. We have only to look at\r\nthe crumbled and contorted strata to see that they have been forced\r\ninto all kinds of positions, sometimes standing bolt upright (see\r\ndiagrams, chap. ix., p. 307). And as we cannot believe, for many\r\nreasons, that these movements were of a very sudden or violent kind,\r\nwe must consider that they took place slowly on the whole; but\r\nbesides being folded and twisted, the rocks of mountains frequently\r\nexhibit clear signs of having been split and cracked. The fractures\r\nare of all sizes, from an inch or more up to hundreds or even\r\nthousands of feet. They tell us plainly that the rocks were once\r\nslowly bent, and that after a certain amount of bending had taken\r\nplace, the strain put upon them became greater than they could bear,\r\nand consequently they snapped and split along certain lines. This is\r\njust what might be expected. For instance, ice on a pond will bend a\r\ngood deal, but only up to a certain amount; after that, it cracks in\r\nlong lines with a remarkably sharp and smooth fracture. But suppose\r\nthe pressure came from below instead of from above, as when a number\r\nof people are skating on a pond. Should we not see the ice forced\r\nup in some places, so that some sheets stood up above the others\r\nafter sliding past their broken edges? This is just what the rocks\r\nin different places have frequently done. After a fracture has taken\r\nplace the rock on one side has slid up over the other, and the two\r\nsurfaces made by the fracture--like two long walls--are no longer\r\nseen at the same level. One has been pushed up, while the other has\r\ngone down (see diagram of the ranges of the Great Basin, chap. viii.,\r\np. 273).\r\n\r\nNow, it is almost impossible to conceive of these tremendous\r\nfractures taking place in the rocks below our feet without causing\r\nsudden jars or shocks. Here, then, we seem to have a clue to the\r\nproblem. Even if the movements took place only a few inches or a few\r\nfeet at a time, that does not spoil our theory, but rather favours\r\nit; for in that case the upheaval of a mountain-chain will have\r\ntaken a very long time (which is almost certain), and may have been\r\naccomplished bit by bit. Hundreds and thousands of earthquake shocks,\r\nsome slight, and others severe, may have attended the upheaval of a\r\nmountain-range.\r\n\r\nThis explanation is accepted by many authorities. It does not exactly\r\nimply that mountains were upheaved by earthquakes; but it means that\r\nthe same forces that elevate continents, heaving them up out of the\r\nsea into ridges and very low arches, have been at work to crumple and\r\nfold their rocks in some places into stupendous folds, such as we now\r\nfind form part of the general structure of mountains; and that in so\r\ndoing they caused fearful strains, too great for the rocks to bear,\r\nso that they split over and over again, and in so doing produced jars\r\nand shocks that must have been very similar to, if not identical\r\nwith, earthquake shocks as we know them at the present day.\r\n\r\nSuch an explanation is in striking harmony with what we have\r\nalready learned about the operations of Nature. It was from the\r\nlong-continued operation of rain and rivers that the materials now\r\nforming mountains were transported to the seas in which they were\r\nslowly formed. It was also by the ordinary operations of frost,\r\nheat and cold, snow and ice, streams, rain, and rivers that the\r\nmountains received their present shapes (see chapters v. and vii.).\r\nAnd now we learn that the gigantic work of upheaval took place in a\r\ntolerably quiet and uniform manner,--with perhaps only an occasional\r\ncatastrophe of a more violent kind, but still according to the same\r\nlaw of uniformity which is the very basis of modern geology, and by\r\nmeans of which so much can be explained.\r\n\r\nWe could give other proofs of the gradual elevation of mountains\r\nif they were wanted. But at least enough has been said to give\r\nthe reader a glimpse into the methods employed by geologists in\r\nendeavouring to explain how mountains were upheaved; and to show that\r\nit is only by a careful study of all that is taking place now on the\r\nearth that we can ever hope to solve the difficult questions that\r\npresent themselves to all who study those stony records on which the\r\nearth has written for our enlightenment the chapters of her ancient\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it may be asked what is the nature of the force that\r\naccomplishes all this titanic work of upheaval. Although the question\r\nhas been much discussed, and some very ingenious suggestions brought\r\nforward, we cannot say that any of them are entirely satisfactory.\r\nBut we know that the earth is a cooling body which loses so much heat\r\nevery year; and it may be that the shrinking that takes place as it\r\ncools, by leaving the crust of the earth in some places unsupported,\r\ncauses it to settle down, to adapt itself to a smaller surface below,\r\nand in so doing it would inevitably throw itself into a series of\r\nfolds, or wrinkles, like those on the skin of a dried apple. Many\r\nthink that mountain-ranges may be explained in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nHOW THE MOUNTAINS WERE CARVED OUT.\r\n\r\n            And surely the mountain fadeth away,\r\n    And the rock is removed out of its place,\r\n    The waters wear away the stones:\r\n    The overflowings thereof wash away the dust of the earth.\r\n\r\n    _Job xiv. 18._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mighty fortresses of the earth, which seem so imperishable, so\r\nmajestic in their strength, and have from time immemorial received\r\ntheir title of \"the everlasting hills,\" are nevertheless undergoing\r\nconstant change and decay. They cannot abide for ever. Those waste\r\nleagues around their feet are loaded with the wrecks of what once\r\nbelonged to them; they are witnesses to the victory of the hostile\r\nforces that are for ever contending with them, and pledges of a final\r\ntriumph. To those who will read their story, mountains stand like old\r\ndismantled castles, mere wrecks of ruined masonry, that have nearly\r\ncrumbled away, telling us of a time when all their separate peaks\r\nand crags were one solid mass, perhaps an elevated smooth plateau\r\nuntouched by the rude hand of time.\r\n\r\nLet us now inquire how the work of destruction is accomplished.\r\nReferring back to our illustration of the cathedral, given in chap.\r\nv., pp. 143-147, the question we have now to consider is, how the\r\nmountains were carved out into all these wonderful features of crag\r\nand precipice, peak and pass, which are such a source of delight\r\nto all who care for scenery. This work we included in the one word\r\n\"ornamentation.\" What, then, are the tools which Nature uses in this\r\nwork of carving out the hills? What are her axes and hammers, her\r\nchisels and saws?\r\n\r\nThis question, like many others, must be answered by observing what\r\ntakes place at the present day. It is scarcely necessary to say that\r\nmountains and mountain-ranges are not simply the result of upheaval,\r\nthough they have been upheaved. If that were so, they would probably\r\nappear as long smooth, monotonous ridges, with no separate mountain\r\nmasses, no peaks, no glens or valleys; in some cases they might\r\nappear as simply elevated and smooth plateaux. Such mountains, if\r\nwe may so call them, would be almost as uninteresting as the roof\r\nof a gabled house down which the rain finds its way in one smooth\r\ncontinuous sheet.\r\n\r\nMountains, reaching as they do into the higher regions of the\r\natmosphere, where the winds blow more fiercely than on the plains\r\nbelow, storms rage more violently, and the extremes of heat and cold\r\nare more severe,--in fact, where every process of change and decay\r\nseems quickened,--suffer continually at the hands of the elements.\r\n\r\n   \"Death must be upon the hills, and the cruelty of the tempests\r\n   smite them, and the thorn and the briar spring up upon them;\r\n   but they so smite as to bring their rocks into the fairest\r\n   forms, and so spring as to make the very desert blossom as the\r\n   rose.\"[23]\r\n\r\n  [23] Modern Painters.\r\n\r\nNature never leaves them alone, never gives them a brief armistice in\r\nthe long war that she wages against them. She is a relentless enemy,\r\never on the move, and ever varying her methods of attack. Now she\r\nassails them openly with her storm-clouds, and pelts them furiously\r\nwith driving rain; now we hear the thunder of her artillery, as she\r\npierces their crests with strange electric darts of fire; now she\r\nsecretly undermines their sides with her hidden sources of water,\r\ntill whole villages are destroyed by some fearful fall of overhanging\r\nrocks (see chapter iii., pages 96-101). Her winds and gentle breezes\r\nare for ever at work on their surfaces, causing them to crumble into\r\ndust much in the same way as iron turns to rust.\r\n\r\nAgain, she heats them by day and then chills them suddenly at night,\r\nunder the cold starry sky, so that they crack under the strain of\r\nexpanding and contracting. Now she splits them with her ice-wedges;\r\nnow she furrows their sides with the dashing torrents and running\r\nstreams; and yet again she wears them gently down with her glaciers,\r\nand carries away their débris--the token of her triumph--on those icy\r\nstreams, as conquering armies carry the spoils in procession.\r\n\r\nThis is, briefly, her mode of warfare; these are some of her tools,\r\n_wind_, _rain_, _frost_, _snow_, _heat_ and _cold_, _streams_,\r\n_rivers_, and _glaciers_. Lightning does occasionally break off\r\nportions of a cliff or a mountain-peak; but compared to the others,\r\nthis agent is not very important.\r\n\r\nLet us first inquire into the effects produced by the atmosphere.\r\nThe air around us is composed mainly of two well-known gases;\r\nnamely, oxygen and nitrogen. There is also a small proportion (about\r\none in ten thousand) of carbonic acid gas; a variable quantity of\r\nwater-vapour, and in the neighbourhood of towns, traces of other\r\nnoxious gases, such as sulphurous acid and chlorine.\r\n\r\nNow, the nitrogen plays a very unimportant part, as it merely\r\nserves to dilute the powerful gas, oxygen, which has such important\r\nlife-sustaining properties. We live by breathing oxygen; so do all\r\nanimals; and the more pure air we can contrive to get into our\r\nlungs, the better. But undiluted oxygen would be too strong for us,\r\nand so its strength is diminished by being mixed with four parts of\r\nnitrogen; that is to say, the air only contains about one fifth by\r\nvolume, or bulk, of oxygen and four fifths of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nNow, oxygen, being always ready to combine chemically with some other\r\nelement, is a great agent of change and decay. It attacks all the\r\nmetals except gold and platinum. Iron, we all know, oxidises, or\r\nrusts, only too quickly; but copper, lead, silver, and other metals\r\nare more or less attacked by it. So it is with all the rocks exposed\r\nat or near the surface of the earth. Oxygen will, if it can, pick\r\nout something to combine with and so bring about chemical changes\r\nwhich lead to decay. But a much more powerful agent is the carbonic\r\nacid gas in the atmosphere; although there is so little of it, there\r\nis enough to play a very important part in causing rocks to crumble\r\naway, and in some cases to dissolve them entirely. The supply of this\r\ngas is continually being renewed, for all living animals breathe out\r\ncarbonic acid, and plants give it out by night. Under the influence\r\nof sunlight plants give out oxygen, so that gas is supplied to the\r\nair by day.\r\n\r\nBoth oxygen and carbonic acid gas are dissolved by rain as it falls\r\nthrough the air; and so we cannot separate the effects of the dry\r\nair by itself from those of rain and mist, which are more important\r\nagents. The action of rain is partly mechanical, partly chemical, for\r\nit not only beats against them, but it dissolves out certain mineral\r\nsubstances that they contain.\r\n\r\nAll rocks are mixtures of two or more kinds of minerals, the\r\nparticles of each being often invisible to the naked eye. Thus\r\ngranites are essentially mixtures of felspar, quartz, and mica;\r\nordinary volcanic rocks (\"trap-rocks\") of felspar and augite;\r\nsandstones consist mainly of particles of silica; limestones of\r\ncarbonate of lime; shales and slates of silicate of alumina, the\r\nprincipal substance in clay. These grains are usually joined together\r\nby a cement of some mineral differing more or less from the other\r\nparticles. Lime is found in many of the rocks as the cement that\r\nbinds their particles together; while oxide of iron and silica serve\r\nthis purpose in many other instances. Now, if the lime or iron or\r\nsilica is dissolved by water, the rock must tend to crumble away. Any\r\nold building shows more or less manifold signs of such decay, and\r\nthis process is called \"weathering.\" All this applies merely to the\r\nsurfaces of rocks; and if there were no other forces at work, their\r\nrate of decay would be very slow.\r\n\r\nBut there are other forces at work. In the first place, sudden\r\nchanges of temperature have a destructive influence. If the sun\r\nshines brightly by day, the rocks--especially in higher mountain\r\nregions--are considerably expanded by the heat they receive; and if\r\na hot day is followed by a clear sky at night, the free radiation of\r\nheat into space (see chap. ii., p. 39) causes them to become very\r\ncold, and in cooling down they contract. In this way an internal\r\nstrain is set up which is often greater than they can bear, and so\r\nthey split and crack. Thus small pieces of rock are detached from a\r\nmountain-side. An Alpine traveller told the writer that one night\r\nwhen sleeping on a mountain-side, he heard stones rattling down at\r\nfrequent intervals. Livingstone records in his journal that when\r\nin the desert he frequently heard stones splitting at night with a\r\nreport like that of a pistol. But sometimes the expansion by day is\r\nsufficient to cause fragments of rock to be broken off.\r\n\r\nFrost, however, is responsible for a vast amount of destruction among\r\nrocks. When water freezes, it expands with tremendous force; and this\r\nis the reason why water-pipes so frequently burst during a frost,\r\nthough we don't find it out until the thaw comes,--followed by long\r\nplumbers' bills. Rocks, being traversed in several directions by\r\ncracks, allow the water to get into them, and this in freezing acts\r\nlike a very powerful wedge; and so the rocks on the higher parts of\r\nthe mountains are continually being split up by Nature's ice-wedge.\r\n\r\nThe amount of rock broken up in this way every year is enormous.\r\nStone walls and buildings often suffer greatly from this cause during\r\na long frost, especially if the stone be of a more than usually\r\nporous kind, that can take up a good deal of rain water.\r\n\r\nWhere trees, shrubs, etc., grow on rocks, the roots find their way\r\ninto its natural divisions, widened by the action of rain soaking\r\ndown into them; and as they grow, they slowly widen them, and in time\r\nportions are actually detached in this manner. Moreover, the roots\r\nand rootlets guide the rain water down into the cracks, or joints, as\r\nthey are called. Even the ivy that creeps over old ruined walls has a\r\ndecidedly destructive effect.\r\n\r\nAt the base of every steep mountain may be seen heaps of loose\r\nangular stones; sometimes these are covered with soil, and form long\r\nslopes on which trees and shrubs grow. Every one of the numerous\r\nlittle gullies that furrow the mountain-sides has at its lower\r\nend a similar little heap of stones. Sometimes a valley among the\r\nmountains seems half choked with rocky fragments; and if these were\r\nall removed, the valley would be deeper than it is. In some hot\r\ncountries, where the streams only flow in winter, this is especially\r\nthe case; for example, every valley, or \"wady,\" in the region of\r\nMount Sinai and Mount Horeb is more or less choked up with boulders\r\nand stones of every size, because the stones come down faster than\r\nthey can be carried away.\r\n\r\nBut the main work of carving out the hills and mountains of the\r\nworld is done by streams, rivers, and glaciers; and so we now pass\r\non to consider how they perform their tasks. Water by itself, even\r\nwhen flowing fast, would be powerless to carve gorges and valleys\r\nin the solid rock; but the stones which torrents and streams carry\r\nalong give them a marvellous grinding power, for with such material\r\na stream continually wears away its rocky bed. Moreover, the stones\r\nthemselves are all the while being rubbed down by each other, until\r\nfinally they are ground down to fine sand and mud, which help in the\r\nwork of erosion.\r\n\r\nEvery mountain stream or torrent runs in a ravine or valley of some\r\nsort; and any traveller who will take the trouble to watch what goes\r\non there may easily convince himself that the ravine, gorge, or\r\nvalley has been carved out by the stream, aided by the atmospheric\r\ninfluences to which we have already alluded.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps some may be inclined to look upon the ravine as a chasm\r\nproduced by some violent disturbance from below, whereby the rocks\r\nwere rent asunder, and that the stream somehow found its way into the\r\nrent. A little inquiry will dispel this idea. In the first place,\r\nsuch catastrophes are quite unknown at the present day; and as we\r\nhave more than once pointed out, the geologist's method is to apply\r\na knowledge of processes now in operation to the phenomena of the\r\nrocks, in order to read their history. Secondly, no conclusion can be\r\naccepted which is not supported strongly by evidence.\r\n\r\nIf such a rending of the rocks had taken place, there would assuredly\r\nbe some evidence of the fact. We should expect to find a great crack\r\nrunning all along the bed of the stream; but of this there is no\r\nsign. Go down in any weather when the stream is low, and look at\r\nthe rocks over which it flows, and you will search in vain for such\r\nevidence. Instead of being broken, the rocks extend continually\r\nacross. You would also expect to find the strata \"dipping,\" or\r\nsloping away from the stream on each side, if they had been rent\r\nby such an upheaval; but here again we are met by a total want of\r\nevidence. Thirdly, a crack might be expected to run along more or\r\nless evenly in one direction. But look at the ravine, follow it\r\nup for some miles, and you will see that it winds along in a very\r\ndevious course, not in a straight line.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, then, we must conclude that the ravine or\r\nvalley has been carved out by the stream; but perhaps the most\r\nconvincing arguments are afforded by the furrows and miniature\r\nravines so frequently met with on the sides of all mountains; and\r\nit is impossible to examine these without concluding that they have\r\nin every case been cut out of the solid rock by the little rapid\r\ntorrents that run along them after heavy rain. If we are fortunate\r\nenough to see them on a thoroughly rainy day, we may derive much\r\ninstruction from watching the little torrents at work as they run\r\ndown the mountain-side, here and there dashing over the rocks in\r\nlittle cascades, and bringing down to the base of the hill much of\r\nthe débris that forms higher up. In this way Nature gives us an\r\n\"object lesson,\" and seems to say: \"Watch me at work here, and learn\r\nfrom such little operations how I work on a larger scale, and carve\r\nout my ravines and big valleys. Only give me plenty of time, and I\r\ncan accomplish much greater feats than this.\"\r\n\r\nThe question of time is no longer disputed; and all geologists are\r\nwilling to grant almost unlimited time, at least periods of time that\r\nseem to us unlimited. Most streams have been flowing for thousands\r\nof years; and when once we grant that, we find no difficulty in\r\nbelieving that all valleys are the work of rain and rivers. Surely\r\nno one would argue that the furrows on a mountain-side are all rents\r\nwhich have been widened by the action of water; for if they were\r\nrents, each must have been caused by some disturbance of the rocks\r\ncomposing the mountain, and we should of course be able to see the\r\ncracks for ourselves, and to find that the rocks had in some way been\r\ndisturbed and rent open.\r\n\r\nEven the rain which falls on the road in a heavy shower teaches the\r\nsame simple but important lesson, as it runs off into the gutters\r\non each side; and we may often find the road furrowed by little\r\nminiature rivers, that carve out for themselves tiny valleys as they\r\nrun off into the gutter, bringing with them much débris in the form\r\nof mud and sand.\r\n\r\nSometimes a stream encounters in its course a layer of rock that is\r\nharder than the rock underlying it. In this case the softer rock\r\nis worn away faster, and the hard layer forms a kind of ridge at a\r\nhigher level; the result is a waterfall. Waterfalls are frequently\r\nfound in mountain streams. In this case, it is easy to trace the\r\nridge of harder rock running unbroken across the path of the stream,\r\nshowing clearly that it has not been rent in any way. First it showed\r\nmerely as a kind of step, but gradually the force of the falling\r\nwater told with greater effect on the softer rock below, wearing it\r\naway more rapidly than that above, and so the depth of the waterfall\r\nwent on increasing year by year; and at the same time the hard layer\r\nwas slowly worn away until the stream sawed its way through.\r\n\r\nSome river valleys are steep and narrow; others are broad, with\r\ngently sloping sides. A careful study of the different valleys in\r\nany large country such as Great Britain, shows that their forms vary\r\naccording to the nature of the rocks through which rivers flow. Where\r\nhard rocks abound, the valleys are steep and narrow; where soft rocks\r\noccur, the valleys are broad and low. This is only what might be\r\nexpected, for hard rocks are not easily worn away; a river must cut\r\nits way through them, leaving cliffs on either side that cannot be\r\nwasted away by rain. But in a district where clay or soft sandstone\r\noccurs, the rain, as it finds its way to the valley, will wash them\r\naway and give a smooth gentle slope to the sides of the valley.\r\n\r\nIt is very instructive to notice how the scenery of any district\r\ndepends on the nature of its prevailing rocks. Hard rocks give bold\r\nscenery with steep hills and rocky defiles; while soft rocks make the\r\nlandscape comparatively flat and tame, though often very beautiful\r\nin its way, especially where a rich soil abounds, so that we see\r\npleasant woods, rich pasture-land, and heavy crops in the fields.\r\n\r\nCompare, for instance, the scenery of Kent or Surrey with that\r\nof the Lake District or the west of Yorkshire. The difference\r\nis due chiefly to the fact that in Kent and Surrey we have rocks\r\nthat succumb more easily to the action of rain and rivers, and\r\nconsequently are worn away more rapidly than the harder rocks in the\r\nnorth country. Geologists have a word to express the effects of this\r\nwear and tear; namely, \"denudation,\" which means a stripping off, or\r\nlaying bare.\r\n\r\nIn Kent and Surrey the agents of denudation (rain and rivers, aided\r\nby the effects of the air, of heat and cold, and so on) wear away the\r\nwhole surface of the county in a tolerably even and uniform manner,\r\nbecause there are no hard rocks for them to contend with. In this\r\ncase rain washes away the sides of the valleys faster than the river\r\ncan carve its bed, consequently the valleys are shallow compared to\r\ntheir width. And so the streams have broad valleys, while the hills\r\nare smooth and gently rounded. Chalk, clay, and soft sandstone abound\r\nthere. The two latter rocks are washed away with comparative ease,\r\nand the chalk is dissolved; whereas in the Lake District we have very\r\nmuch harder and older rocks, that require to be split up and broken\r\nby the action of frost, while every stream carves out for itself a\r\nsteep valley, and great masses of hard rock stand out as bold hills\r\nor mountains, that seem to defy all the agents of denudation. Here\r\nthe opposite is the case, and the valleys are deepened faster than\r\nthey are widened. But for all that, a vast amount of solid rock has\r\nbeen removed from the surface there, of which the mountains are, as\r\nit were, but fragments that have escaped the general destruction.\r\nMoreover, the rocks in this region have been greatly disturbed and\r\ncrumpled since they were first formed, and thereby thrown into\r\nvarious shapes that give certain peculiar structures more or less\r\ncapable of resisting denudation.\r\n\r\nVery effective illustrations of the power of rain by itself are\r\nafforded by the \"earth pillars\" of the Tyrol, and \"cañons\" of\r\nColorado. The material of which they consist is called conglomerate,\r\nbecause it is composed of stones and large blocks of rock with stiff\r\nearth or clay between. All the taller ones have a big stone on the\r\ntop which protects the softer material below from being washed away\r\nby heavy rains; and it is easily perceived that each pillar owes its\r\nexistence to the stone on the top, which prevents the soft materials\r\nbelow it from being washed away. When, after a time, the weathering\r\nof the soft strata diminishes the support of the capping boulders,\r\nthese at last topple over, and the pillar, thus left unprotected,\r\nbecomes an easy prey to the rain, and is rapidly washed away. Some\r\nof the pillars are over a hundred feet in height. But it is only in\r\nplaces where heavy rains fall that these interesting monuments of\r\ndenudation are to be seen.\r\n\r\nBy way of contrast we may turn now to a district in which very little\r\nrain falls, but where the streams have a considerable slope, and so\r\ncan wear away, or erode, their valleys much faster than rain and\r\nfrost, etc., can bring down the rocks of which the sides are composed.\r\n\r\nThe river Colorado of the West, which runs from the Rocky Mountains\r\nto the Gulf of California, flows for nearly three hundred miles at\r\nthe bottom of a profound chasm, or cañon, being hemmed in by vertical\r\nwalls which in some places are more than a mile in depth. The\r\ntributary streams flowing into the river run through smaller ravines\r\nforming side cañons; and there is no doubt that these wonderful\r\nchasms have been, in the course of ages, slowly carved out by the\r\nriver Colorado and its numerous tributary streams. Sometimes the\r\nwalls of the cañon are not more than fifty yards apart, and in height\r\nthey vary from three thousand to six thousand feet.\r\n\r\nFar above the level of the highest floods patches of gravel are found\r\nhere and there on the sides, which must have been left there by the\r\nriver when it had not cut its way so far down. These cañons afford\r\nstriking testimony to the erosive power of running water, of which\r\nthey are the most wonderful illustration in the world.\r\n\r\nBut water, even when in the form of ice, has more or less power to\r\nwear away solid rock; and the glaciers that we see in Switzerland,\r\nNorway, and other countries must slightly deepen the rocky valleys\r\ndown which they flow. Let us see how this can be accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe snow that falls in the High Alps, impelled by the weight of fresh\r\nlayers of snow overlying it, and by the slope of the mountain-sides,\r\ngradually creeps down into the valleys. Owing to the pressure thus\r\nput upon it, and partly to the melting power of the sun's rays, it\r\nassumes the form of ice; and glaciers are composed of solid ice. The\r\ndownward motion is so slow that a glacier appears quite stationary;\r\nand it is only by putting in stakes and watching them change their\r\npositions that it can be shown to be moving.\r\n\r\nIn all respects except speed, glaciers flow like rivers, for ice is\r\na viscous body, behaving partly like a fluid and yet partly like\r\na solid substance; but it will not endure a sharp bend without\r\nsnapping. Hence, a glacier in traversing a valley frequently gets\r\nsplit. The cracks thus formed widen by degrees until they expand\r\ninto chasms, or \"crevasses.\" Like rivers, glaciers transport a large\r\namount of rocky matter to lower levels, and at the same time wear\r\naway and deepen their rocky channels.\r\n\r\nLet us see how they do this twofold work of transportation and\r\nerosion. In the first place, a large amount of débris falls onto the\r\nsides of a glacier from the peaks, precipices, and mountain-side\r\nalong which it flows. Some stones, however, fall down crevasses, and\r\nso reach the bottom, where they become cemented in the ice. In this\r\nway they are slowly carried down over the rocky floor of the valley,\r\nuntil at last they reach the end of the glacier, where in the warmer\r\nair the ice melts just as fast as it creeps down; and there they will\r\nbe left to form a heap of stones, sand, and mud.\r\n\r\nLarge blocks of stone, quite different from the rocks on which they\r\nlie, are very numerous, and are called \"erratics,\" since they are\r\nevidently wanderers from a distance. Sometimes such blocks can be\r\nproved to have been brought many miles from their home among the\r\nhigher peaks. The long lines of stones and mud seen on the sides of\r\na glacier are called \"moraines,\" and at the end of every glacier we\r\nfind a big heap known as a \"terminal moraine.\" But the stones of\r\nwhich they are composed are probably not to be entirely accounted\r\nfor in this way. Can we not conceive that the weight and pressure of\r\na descending glacier may be sufficient to break off many protruding\r\nportions of the rocky bed over which it flows, and then to drag them\r\nalong with it? This seems reasonable. Let us therefore consider\r\nthe materials of which moraines are composed to be derived partly\r\nfrom the rocks beneath and partly from those above the glacier. But\r\nwhatever their origin, such materials must inevitably find their way\r\nto the end of the glacier and be added to the big heap there. The\r\nwork of transportation is then taken up by the stream which always\r\nflows from the end of a glacier. Such streams are in summer-time\r\nladen with fine sediment, which gives them a milky and turbid\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThus a glacier wears away the rocks over which it flows; rock\r\nfragments become embedded in the ice, and these are the tools with\r\nwhich a glacier does its work. It must be granted that the downward\r\nmovement of a great mass of ice is irresistible, and consequently\r\nthat as the moving glacier slowly creeps along, it must inevitably\r\ncause the stones which it thus holds to grind over the surface of\r\nthe rock. It is easy to imagine the effects of this grinding action.\r\nIf sand-paper, rubbed for a minute or two over wood, wears down and\r\nsmooths its surface, what must be the result of all these stones,\r\ntogether with sand and mud, grinding over the rocky bed?\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question is found in examining the rocks over\r\nwhich glaciers once flowed. Now, the Swiss glaciers once extended\r\nfar beyond their present limits; and the rocks in the lower parts of\r\ntheir present valleys, now free from ice, show unmistakable signs\r\nof having been considerably worn down. The corners and angles of\r\nprojecting pieces of rock have been worn away until the once rugged\r\noutline has become wavy and round, so much so as to produce more or\r\nless resemblance to the backs of sheep lying down. Hence the name\r\n_roches moutonnées_, by which rocks of this shape are known. They\r\nfrequently retain on their surface peculiar markings, such as long\r\nscratches and grooves which must have been made as the old glacier,\r\nwith its embedded angular fragments of rock, slowly ground over\r\ntheir surfaces. Such markings are called \"striæ.\" But besides these\r\nglacial records graven on the rocks, we have other evidence, in the\r\nform of great moraines in some of the valleys of Switzerland, and\r\nespecially at those places where side valleys open out into a main\r\nvalley. Any one may learn by a little observation to recognise these\r\npeculiar heaps of stones, mud, and sand, deposited long ago by the\r\nold glaciers of Switzerland.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that the evidence for the erosive power of\r\nglaciers is of two kinds,--first, there is the testimony of the\r\nsmoothed and striated rocks, which is very convincing; secondly,\r\nthe equally strong proofs from the moraines, both great and small.\r\nThese old rubbish heaps give us a very fair idea of the amount of\r\nwear and tear that goes on under a glacier, for there we see the rock\r\nfragments that tumbled down the mountain-side onto the surface of the\r\nglacier (together with those which the glacier tore off its rocky\r\nbed), all considerably smoothed, worn down, and striated. But a still\r\nbetter idea of the work done is afforded by the gravel, mud, and sand\r\nin which these stones are embedded. All this finer material must have\r\nbeen the result of wear and tear. This kind of action may well be\r\ncompared to what takes place on a grindstone as one sharpens an axe\r\non it. The water poured on the stone soon becomes muddy, owing to the\r\npresence of countless little grains of sand worn off the grindstone.\r\nBut a good deal of the mud thus formed is carried away by the little\r\nstream that runs out from the end of every glacier; so that there is\r\nmore formed than we see in the moraine.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE MER DE GLACE AND MONT BUET. FROM A PHOTOGRAPH\r\n  BY MR. DONKIN.]\r\n\r\nWe have already alluded in former chapters to the \"Ice Age\" in\r\nBritain, when great glaciers covered all our high mountains, and\r\ndescended far and wide over the plains. Now, the evidence for the\r\nformer existence of these glaciers is of the same kind as that which\r\nwe have just described. In Wales and Scotland we may soon learn\r\nto recognise the _roches moutonnées_, the old moraine heaps, and\r\nthe erratic boulders brought down by these old glaciers. Besides\r\nthese proofs, there is also the evidence of the arctic plants now\r\nflourishing in the highlands (see chapter iv., pages 123-124).\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt, then, that glaciers have an erosive action,\r\nand therefore must be regarded as agents of denudation. But it is\r\nimportant to bear in mind that their powers in this direction are\r\nlimited; for it is manifest that a mountain stream is a much more\r\npowerful agent, and will deepen its little valley much more rapidly,\r\nthan a cumbrous, slow-moving glacier, advancing at the rate of a\r\nfew inches a day. It has been found by careful measurements that\r\nthe Mer de Glace of Chamouni moves during summer and autumn at the\r\naverage daily rate of twenty to twenty-seven inches in the centre,\r\nand thirteen to nineteen and one half inches near the side, where\r\nfriction somewhat impedes its course. This seems very slow compared\r\nto the rapid movement of a mountain stream; but then, a glacier\r\npartly makes up for this by its great weight.\r\n\r\nIn considering a glacier as an agent of erosion, we must not forget\r\nthat probably a good deal of water circulates beneath glaciers. If\r\nthis is so, the water must have a considerable share in producing the\r\neffects to which we have already alluded. It would be extremely rash\r\nto conclude, as some students of glaciers have done, that valleys\r\ncan be carved out _entirely_ by glaciers; and we must be content\r\nwith believing that they have been somewhat deepened by ice-action,\r\nand their features more or less altered, but no more. The valleys of\r\nSwitzerland, of Wales, and Scotland, were probably all in existence\r\nbefore the period of the \"Ice Age,\" having been carved out by streams\r\nin the usual way; but the glaciers, as it were, put the final touches\r\nand smoothed their surfaces.\r\n\r\nHaving learned how the three agents of denudation--namely, rain,\r\nrivers, and glaciers--accomplish their work, let us now take a wider\r\nview of the subject and consider the results of their united efforts\r\nboth in the present and in the past.\r\n\r\nWe have already alluded to the enormous amount of solid matter\r\nbrought down to the sea every year by rivers (see chap. v., pp.\r\n166-168), and we pointed out that all this represents so much débris\r\nswept off the land through which the rivers flow; also that it comes\r\ndown in three ways, one part being suspended in the water as fine\r\nmud, another part being pushed along the river-bed as gravel, etc.,\r\nwhile a third part is the carbonate of lime and other mineral matter\r\nin a dissolved state, and therefore invisible.\r\n\r\nNow, it is quite plain that rain and rivers, in sweeping away so much\r\nsolid matter from the surface of the land, must tend in the course\r\nof time to lower its general level; and it therefore seems to follow\r\nthat after the lapse of ages any given continent or large island\r\nmight be entirely washed away, or in other words, reduced to the\r\nlevel of the sea. This would certainly happen were it not that the\r\nlands of the world seem to be slowly rising, so that the denudation\r\ngoing on at the surface appears to be counterbalanced by continued\r\nupheaval.\r\n\r\nBut, supposing no upheaval took place, how long would it take for\r\nrain and rivers to wear away a whole continent? Let us see if there\r\nis any way of answering this difficult question, for if it can be\r\neven partially solved, it will help us to realise the enormous length\r\nof time that must have been required to bring about the results of\r\ndenudation that we see all around us.\r\n\r\nAlthough the calculations that have been made on this subject are\r\nvery complicated, yet the principle on which they are based is quite\r\nsimple. For an answer to our question we must go to the rivers again,\r\nand measure the work they do in transporting solid matter down to\r\nthe sea. Let us take the Mississippi as a typical big river, for\r\nit has been more carefully studied than any other, and it drains a\r\nvery extensive area, embracing many varieties of climate, rock, and\r\nsoil. As the result of many observations carried on continuously at\r\ndifferent parts of the river for months together, the engineers who\r\nconducted the investigation found that the annual discharge of water\r\nby this river is about nineteen thousand millions of cubic feet,\r\nand that on the average the amount of sediment it contains is about\r\na 1/1500th part by weight. But besides the matter in suspension,\r\nthey observed that a large amount of sand, gravel, and stones is\r\nbeing constantly pushed along the bottom of the river. This they\r\nestimated at over seven hundred and fifty millions of cubic feet.\r\nThey also calculated that the Mississippi brings down every year\r\nmore than eight hundred thousand million pounds of mud. Putting the\r\ntwo together, they found (as before stated) that the amount of solid\r\nmatter thus transported down to the Gulf of Mexico may be represented\r\nby a layer 268 feet high, covering a space of one square mile; that\r\nis, without allowing for what is brought down dissolved in the water,\r\nwhich may be neglected in order to prevent any exaggeration.\r\n\r\nNow, it is quite clear that all this débris must have come from the\r\nimmense area that is drained by the Mississippi. It could not have\r\nbeen supplied by any rivers except those that are its tributaries.\r\nAnd so if we can find out what is the extent of this area, it is not\r\ndifficult to calculate how much its general surface must have been\r\nlowered, or in other words, how much must have been worn away from\r\nit in order to supply all the material. This area is reckoned at\r\n1,147,000 square miles; and a very simple calculation tells us that\r\nthe general surface would thus be lowered to the extent of 1/6000th\r\npart of a foot. That of course means that one foot would be worn away\r\nin six thousand years. On high ground and among mountains the rate of\r\ndenudation would of course be much greater; but we are now dealing\r\nwith an average for the whole surface.\r\n\r\nThe next thing we require to finish this calculation is the average\r\nor mean height of the American continent. This was reckoned by the\r\ncelebrated Humboldt at 748 feet. Now if we may assume that all this\r\ncontinent is being worn down at the same rate of one foot in six\r\nthousand years (which is a reasonable assumption), we find, by a\r\nsimple process of multiplication, that it would require about four\r\nand a half millions of years for rain and rivers to wash it all away\r\nuntil its surface was all at the sea-level (with perhaps a few little\r\nislands projecting here and there as relics of its vast denudation).\r\nThis is a very interesting result; and if the above measurements are\r\nreliable, they afford us some idea of the rate at which denudation\r\ntakes place at the present time.\r\n\r\nBy a similar process it has been calculated the British Isles might\r\nbe levelled in about five and a half millions of years. Geologists\r\ndo not pretend to have solved this problem accurately; that is\r\nimpossible with our present knowledge. But even as rough estimates\r\nthese results are very valuable, especially when we come to study\r\nthe structure of the land in different countries, and to find out\r\ntherefrom, by actual measurement, how much solid rock has been\r\nremoved. We will now give some examples of this; but perhaps a simple\r\nillustration will make our meaning clearer.\r\n\r\nSuppose we picked up an old pair of boots, and found the soles worn\r\naway in the centre. It would be easy to find out how much had been\r\nworn away over the holes by simply measuring the thickness of leather\r\nat the sides, where we will suppose that they were protected by\r\nstrong nails. Geologists apply a very similar kind of method in order\r\nto find out how much rock has been removed from a certain region of\r\nthe earth. One of the simplest cases of this kind is that of the area\r\nknown as the Weald of Kent, Surrey, and Sussex (see illustration,\r\nFig. 1). A great deal of denudation has taken place here, because\r\nthere is ample evidence to prove that the great \"formation\" known\r\nas the Chalk (now seen in the North and South Downs) once stretched\r\nright across; and below this came the lower greensand and Weald clay.\r\nThey spread over this area in a low arch of which we now only see the\r\nruins.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 1. SECTION ACROSS THE WEALD OF KENT AND\r\n  SURREY.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 2. THE HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND ON A TRUE SCALE\r\n  (after GEIKIE).]\r\n\r\nThe dotted lines in the figure show us their former extent; but\r\nthe vertical height is exaggerated, for otherwise the hills would\r\nscarcely be seen.\r\n\r\nThese lines simply follow out the curves taken by the strata at each\r\nend of the denuded arch, and therefore rightly indicate its former\r\nheight. By making such a drawing on a true scale, geologists can\r\neasily measure the former height of the surface of this old arch,\r\nor \"anticline,\" of chalk, greensand, and other strata, just as an\r\narchitect might restore the outlines of an old traceried window from\r\na few portions left at the sides.\r\n\r\nThis very useful and instructive method is much employed in drawing\r\nsections through mountain-chains, in order to gain some idea of the\r\namount of denudation which they have suffered.\r\n\r\nLet us see how much has been removed from the present surface of\r\nthe Weald. First there is the chalk, which we may put down at six\r\nhundred feet at least; then there is the lower greensand, say, eight\r\nhundred feet; and below that, and forming the lowest ground in the\r\nWeald, is the Weald clay, which is one thousand feet thick, and being\r\nsofter, was more rapidly borne away. Along the centre runs a ridge\r\nof Hastings sand, forming higher ground on account of its greater\r\nhardness, but this formation is not much denuded. However, adding\r\ntogether the thicknesses of the others, we arrive at the conclusion\r\nthat about twenty-four hundred feet of chalk and other strata has\r\nbeen removed from the present surface of the Weald. And all this\r\ndenudation has probably been effected by rain and rivers, for it is\r\nvery doubtful whether the sea had any share in this work.\r\n\r\nBut in other parts of our own country we find proofs of denudation\r\non a much grander scale than this; for example, in North Wales there\r\nare rocks now lying exposed at the surface which are of a very much\r\ngreater antiquity than any that may be seen in the Wealden area,\r\nbelonging to the very ancient periods known as the Cambrian and\r\nSilurian. These have evidently been exposed for a much longer time\r\nto the action of denuding forces; and the Welsh hills, as we now\r\nsee them, are but fragments of what they once were. After carefully\r\nmapping out the rocks in the neighbourhood of Snowdon, noting their\r\nthickness, the directions in which they slope, or \"dip,\" so that\r\nthe structure of this region might be ascertained, as in the case\r\nof the Weald, it was found, on drawing sections of the rocks there,\r\nand putting in dotted lines to continue the curves and slopes of the\r\nstrata as known at or near the surface, that from fifteen thousand\r\nto twenty thousand feet of solid rock must have been removed (see\r\ndiagrams, chapter ix., p. 307). Applying the same method to the Lake\r\nDistrict, it has been calculated that the amount of denudation which\r\nthat beautiful country has suffered may be represented by twenty-six\r\nthousand feet. Turning to the other side of the Atlantic, we find\r\nthe American geologists estimate that a thickness of five miles has\r\nbeen removed from a large part of the Appalachian chain of mountains\r\n(near their east coast), and that at least one mile has been eroded\r\nfrom the entire region between the Rocky and Wahsatch Mountains (see\r\nchapter ix.).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we must bear in mind that mountains, in spite of the\r\nenormous erosion they have suffered, are more capable of resisting\r\nthe ever active agents of denudation than the softer rocks that form\r\nthe plains and lowlands, and consequently stand out in bold relief\r\nfrom other features of the earth's surface. This truth has been\r\nbeautifully expressed in the following passage:--\r\n\r\n   \" ... In order to bring the world into the form which it now\r\n   bears, it was not mere sculpture that was needed; the mountains\r\n   could not stand for a day unless they were formed of materials\r\n   altogether different from those which constitute the lower\r\n   hills and the surfaces of the valleys. A harder substance had\r\n   to be prepared for every mountain-chain, yet not so hard but\r\n   that it might be capable of crumbling down into earth, fit to\r\n   nourish the Alpine forest and the Alpine flowers; not so hard\r\n   but that in the midst of the utmost majesty of its enthroned\r\n   strength there should be seen on it the seal of death, and the\r\n   writing of the same sentence that had gone forth against the\r\n   human frame, 'Dust thou art and unto dust thou shalt return.'\r\n   And with this perishable substance the most majestic forms were\r\n   to be framed that were consistent with the safety of man, and\r\n   the peak was to be lifted and the cliff rent as high and as\r\n   steeply as was possible, in order yet to permit the shepherd\r\n   to feed his flocks upon the slope, and the cottage to nestle\r\n   beneath their shadow.\"[24]\r\n\r\n  [24] Modern Painters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nVOLCANIC MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n    'Tis said Enceladus' huge frame,\r\n    Heart-stricken by the avenging flame,\r\n    Is prisoned here, and underneath\r\n    Gasps through each vent his sulphurous breath;\r\n    And still as his tired side shifts round,\r\n    Trinacia echoes to the sound\r\n    Through all its length, while clouds of smoke\r\n    The living soul of ether choke.\r\n\r\n    VIRGIL: _Æneid iii._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the world we meet with mountains of a very different\r\nkind from any we have yet considered,--mountains that are known\r\nat times to send forth fiery streams of glowing lava, and to emit\r\nwith terrific force great clouds of steam. Such mountains have\r\nlong been known, in popular but unscientific language, as \"burning\r\nmountains,\"[25]--a term which is unfortunate, because they do not\r\nburn in the proper sense of the word, like candles or gas-jets. They\r\nare better known as volcanoes. There are about three hundred and\r\nfifty known active volcanoes; and if we include all mountains that\r\nonce were in that state, the number is about one thousand.\r\n\r\n  [25] See papers by the writer on Volcanoes and Volcanic Action\r\n  in \"Knowledge\" for May and June, 1891, on which this chapter is\r\n  partly based.\r\n\r\nSuch mountains are connected in a curious way with those upheaved\r\nridges of the world known as mountain-chains (see chap. vi., p.\r\n191). And not only are many mountains more or less penetrated and\r\nintersected by rocks of an igneous origin (see chap. v., p. 155),\r\nbut some have been largely formed by the action of old volcanoes.\r\nIn fact, there are hills in Great Britain and parts of Europe, in\r\nAmerica, and other countries, that once were actual volcanoes (see\r\npage 277).\r\n\r\nWe must briefly consider these strange mountains so different from\r\nothers, and see what we can find out about them. Let us first inquire\r\nhow a volcano is made, then consider what a volcano does; that is, we\r\nmust view it as a geological agent that has a certain definite part\r\nto play in the economy of the world. And lastly, we may glance at\r\nsome of the old volcanoes, and see what they were doing in those long\r\nages of the world during which the great series of the stratified\r\nrocks were formed,--which rocks are, as it were, the book in which\r\nthe earth has written her autobiography.\r\n\r\nIn old days volcanoes were regarded with superstitious awe; and any\r\ninvestigation of their actions would have been considered rash and\r\nimpious in the highest degree. Mount Etna, as Virgil tells us, was\r\nsupposed to mark the spot where the angry gods had buried Enceladus,\r\none of the rebellious giants. Volcano, a certain \"burning mountain\"\r\nin the Lipa Islands, was likewise called the forge, or workshop,\r\nof Vulcan (or Volcan), the god of fire. And so it comes about that\r\nall \"burning mountains\" take their name from this one Mediterranean\r\nisland, and at the same time tell us of the mythological origin of\r\nthe word. It has been said that words are \"fossil thoughts;\" and we\r\nhave here an old and very much fossilised thought,--a kind of thought\r\nlong since extinct among civilised peoples, and one which is never\r\nlikely to come to life again.\r\n\r\nA volcanic mountain consists of alternating sheets of lava and\r\nvolcanic ashes, mantling over each other in an irregular way,\r\nand all sloping away from the centre. In the centre is a pit or\r\nchimney, widening out towards the top so as to resemble a funnel or\r\ncup; hence the name \"crater,\" which means a cup. In the centre of\r\nthis crater a very small cone (\"minor cone\") is frequently found;\r\nand it is interesting to find that many of the moon's volcanic\r\ncraters possess these \"minor cones.\" A number of cracks or fissures\r\nintersect the volcano. These frequently spread out from the centre\r\nof the mountain in all directions, like the spokes of a wheel.\r\nThey generally get filled with lava that wells up from below, thus\r\nforming \"dykes,\" which may be regarded as so many sheets of igneous\r\nrock, such as basalt, that have forced their way while still liquid\r\nin among the layers of lava and ashes. The word \"ash\" is used by\r\ngeologists in a special sense; and volcanic ash is not, as might\r\nbe supposed, a deposit of cinders, but mostly of dust of various\r\ndegrees of fineness, and sometimes it is very fine indeed. Pieces\r\nof pumice-stone may be embedded in a layer of volcanic ash, and\r\nsometimes great blocks of stone that have been shot out of the\r\nvolcano as from a big gun, but these only form a small part of the\r\nlayer. Dykes strengthen the mountain, and tend to hold it together\r\nwhen violently shaken during an eruption.\r\n\r\nThe shape and steepness of a volcano depend on the nature of the\r\nmaterials ejected. The finer the volcanic ash, the steeper and more\r\nconical is the mountain. The building up of a volcano may be fairly\r\nillustrated by the little cone of sand formed in an hourglass as the\r\nsand-grains fall. These settle down at a certain slope, or angle,\r\nat which they can remain, instead of falling down to the bottom, as\r\nthey do directly this slope is exceeded. Some volcanoes are built up\r\nalmost entirely of volcanic ash and its embedded blocks. Vesuvius,\r\nTeneriffe, Jorullo, in Mexico, and Cotopaxi, in the Andes, are\r\nexamples of steep volcanic cones built up in this way. Others, less\r\nsteep and more irregular in shape, are chiefly formed of successive\r\nlava-flows. Little minor cones are frequently formed on the side of\r\na volcano; and these during an eruption give rise to small outbursts\r\nof their own. They are easily accounted for by the dykes which are\r\nmentioned just now; for when molten rock forces its way through\r\nfissures, it sometimes finds an outlet at the surface, and being full\r\nof steam, as soda-water is full of gas, it gives rise to an eruption.\r\nThe great opening in the centre of a volcano, with its molten lava,\r\nis like a very big dyke that has reached the surface and so succeeded\r\nin producing an eruption.\r\n\r\nThe opening of a soda-water bottle not infrequently illustrates a\r\nvolcanic eruption; for when the pent-up carbonic acid cannot escape\r\nfast enough, it forces out some of the water, even when the bottle is\r\nheld upright.\r\n\r\nEvery volcano has been built up on a platform of ordinary stratified\r\nrocks; and at some period _after_ these had been laid down in water\r\nand raised up into dry land, molten rock found its way through them,\r\nand so the volcano was built up by successive eruptions during many\r\nyears. It is probable that earthquake shocks, preceding the first\r\neruption, cracked up these strata, and so made a way for the lava to\r\ncome up.\r\n\r\nThe main point we wish to emphasize is that _volcanoes are never\r\nformed by upheaval_. In this way they differ from all other\r\nmountains. They have not been made by the heaving up of strata, but\r\nhave been gradually piled up, something like rubbish heaps that\r\naccumulate in the Thames barges as the dustmen empty their carts into\r\nthem, only in the case of volcanoes the \"rubbish\" comes from below.\r\nIt is not necessary to suppose that the reservoir down below, from\r\nwhich the molten rock is supplied, exists at any very great depth\r\nbelow the original land surface on which the volcano grows up.\r\n\r\nThe old \"upheaval theory\" of volcanoes, once advocated by certain\r\nauthorities, instead of being based on actual evidence or on\r\nreasoning from facts, was a mere guess. Moreover, if the explanation\r\nwe have given should not be sufficiently convincing, there is good\r\nproof furnished by the case of a small volcano near Vesuvius, the\r\nbuilding of which was actually witnessed. It is called Monte Nuovo,\r\nor the New Mountain. It is a little cone 430 feet high, on the bank\r\nof Lake Averno, with a crater more than a mile and a half wide at the\r\nbase. It was almost entirely formed during a single night in the year\r\n1538, A. D. We have two accounts of the eruption to which it owes\r\nits existence; and each writer says distinctly that the mountain was\r\nformed by the falling of stones and ashes.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne witness says,--\r\n\r\n   \"Stones and ashes were thrown up with a noise like the\r\n   discharge of great artillery, in quantities which seemed as if\r\n   they would cover the whole earth; and in four days their fall\r\n   had formed a mountain in the valley between Monte Barbaro and\r\n   Lake Averno, of not less than three miles in circumference, and\r\n   almost as high as Monte Barbaro itself,--a thing incredible\r\n   to those who have not seen it, that in so short a time so\r\n   considerable a mountain should have been formed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother says,--\r\n\r\n   \"Some of the stones were larger than an ox. The mud (ashes\r\n   mixed with water) was at first very liquid, then less so, and\r\n   in such quantities that with the help of the afore-mentioned\r\n   stones a mountain was raised one thousand paces in height.\"\r\n\r\n(The writer's astonishment led him greatly to exaggerate the height.)\r\n\r\nThese accounts are important as showing how in a much longer time\r\na big volcano may be built up. From such small operations we learn\r\nhow Nature works on a large scale. The great volcano in Mexico known\r\nas Jorullo was probably built up in a very similar way. There is a\r\ntradition among the natives that it was made in two or three days;\r\nbut we can hardly believe that. Volcanoes, as they get older, tend\r\nto grow taller and bigger; but every now and then a large portion may\r\nbe blown away by some great eruption, and they have, as it were, to\r\nbegin again.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE ERUPTION OF VESUVIUS IN 1872. FROM AN\r\n  INSTANTANEOUS PHOTOGRAPH.]\r\n\r\nLet us now consider volcanoes as geological agents, and see what\r\nthey do. A volcanic eruption may be described in a general way\r\nas follows: Its advent is heralded by earthquakes affecting the\r\nmountain and the whole country round; loud underground explosions\r\nare heard, resembling the fire of distant artillery. The vibrations\r\nare chiefly transmitted through the ground; the mountain seems\r\nconvulsed by internal throes, due, no doubt, to the efforts of the\r\nimprisoned steam and liquid rock to find an opening. These signs are\r\naccompanied by the drying up of wells and disappearance of springs,\r\nsince the water finds its way down new cracks in the rocks, caused\r\nby the frequent shocks and quiverings. When at last an opening has\r\nbeen made, the eruption begins,--generally with one tremendous\r\nburst that shakes the whole mountain down to its foundations. After\r\nthis, frequent explosions follow with great rapidity and increasing\r\nviolence, generally from the crater. These are indicated by the\r\nglobular masses of steam which are to be seen rising up in a tall\r\ncolumn like that which issues from the funnel of a locomotive. But\r\nsometimes the whole mountain seems to be more or less engaged in\r\ngiving out steam, and thus to be partly enveloped in it. This is\r\nillustrated by our engraving from an instantaneous photograph of\r\nVesuvius in eruption in the year 1872. The steam and other gases, in\r\ntheir violent ascent, hurl up into the air a great deal of solid rock\r\nfrom the sides of the central opening, after first blowing out the\r\nstones which previously stopped up the orifice.\r\n\r\nBlocks of stone falling down meet with others coming up; and so a\r\ntremendous pounding action takes place, the result of which is that\r\ngreat quantities of volcanic dust and ashes are produced, generally\r\nof extreme fineness. Winds and ocean currents transport these light\r\nmaterials for long distances. The observations made during the\r\nfamous and fruitful voyage of H. M. S. \"Challenger\" showed that\r\nfine volcanic dust is carried by wind and marine currents to almost\r\nall parts of the oceans. The darkness so frequently mentioned in\r\naccounts of eruptions--sometimes at a very great distance from the\r\nvolcano--is entirely caused by clouds of volcanic dust hiding the\r\nlight of the sun. Perhaps the best example of this is the case of the\r\neruption of Krakatoa (in the Strait of Sunda, between Sumatra and\r\nJava) in 1883. Its explosions were heard in all directions for two\r\nthousand miles, and a perceptible layer of volcanic dust fell at all\r\nplaces within one thousand miles; while the finest dust and vapour,\r\nshot up fifteen or twenty miles high, were spread all over the globe,\r\ncausing, while still suspended in the atmosphere, the peculiar red\r\nsunsets noticed in all parts of the world for some months after the\r\neruption.\r\n\r\nAgain, those very curious deposits of \"red clay\" found in the very\r\ndeepest parts of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans (at depths of about\r\nfour thousand fathoms, or twenty-four thousand feet) have been shown\r\nto be chiefly composed of volcanic dust, their red colour being due\r\nto oxidised iron.\r\n\r\nBut there is another way in which a good deal of fine volcanic dust\r\nis made; and it is this: the lava is so full of steam intimately\r\nmixed up with it that the steam, in its violent effort to escape,\r\noften blows the lava into mere dust.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting phenomenon may be thus described: Portions of\r\nliquid, or half liquid, lava are caught up by the steam and hurled\r\ninto the air. These assume a more or less round form, and are known\r\nas \"bombs.\" At a distance they give rise to the appearance of\r\nflames. And here we may remark that the flaring, coloured pictures\r\nof Etna or Vesuvius in eruption, which frequently may be seen, are\r\nby no means correct. The huge flames shooting up into the air are\r\nquite imaginary, but are probably suggested by the glare and bright\r\nreflection from glowing molten lava down in the crater.\r\n\r\nSo great is the force of the pent-up steam trying to escape that it\r\nfrequently blows a large part of the volcano bodily away; and in some\r\ncases a whole mountain has been blown to pieces.\r\n\r\nFinally, torrents of rain follow and accompany an eruption,--a result\r\nwhich clearly follows from the condensation of large volumes of\r\nsteam expanding and rising up into the higher and cooler layers of\r\nthe atmosphere. Vast quantities of volcanic ash are caught up by the\r\nrain, and in this way very large quantities of mud are washed down\r\nthe sides of the mountain.\r\n\r\nSometimes the mud-flows are on a large scale, and descending with\r\ngreat force, bury a whole town. It was mostly in this way that the\r\nancient cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii were buried by the great\r\neruption of Vesuvius in the year 79 A. D., in which the elder Pliny\r\nlost his life. The discoveries made during excavations at Pompeii are\r\nof very great interest as illustrating old Roman life. The Italians\r\ngive the name _lava d'acqua_, or water-lava, to flows of this kind,\r\nand they are greatly dreaded on account of their great rapidity. An\r\nordinary lava-stream creeps slowly along, so that people have time\r\nto get out of the way; but in the case of mud-flows there is often\r\nno time to escape. No lava-stream has ever reached Pompeii since it\r\nwas first built, although the foundations of the town stand upon an\r\nold lava-flood. Herculaneum is nearer to Vesuvius, and has at times\r\nbeen visited by lava-streams. Mud-lavas, ashes, and lava-streams have\r\naccumulated over this city to a depth of over seventy feet.\r\n\r\nLava-streams vary greatly in size; in some cases the lava, escaping\r\nfrom craters, comes to rest before reaching the base of the slopes of\r\nthe volcano; in other cases a lava-flow not only reaches the plains\r\nbelow, but extends for many miles over the surrounding country.\r\nHence lava-streams are important geological agents. Let us look at\r\nsome famous instances. The most stupendous flow on record was that\r\nwhich took place from Skaptar Jökull in Iceland, in the year 1783.\r\nIn this case a number of streams issued from the volcano, flooding\r\nthe country far and wide, filling up river gorges which were in some\r\ncases six hundred feet deep and two hundred and fifty feet broad, and\r\nadvancing into the alluvial plains in lakes of molten rock twelve to\r\nfifteen miles wide and one hundred feet deep. Two currents of lava\r\nwhich flowed in nearly opposite directions spread out with varying\r\nthickness according to the nature of the ground for forty and fifty\r\nmiles respectively. Had this great eruption taken place in the south\r\nof England, all the country from the neighbourhood of London to\r\nthat of Gloucester might have been covered by a flood of basalt of\r\nconsiderable thickness.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when the lava can only escape at a point low down on the\r\nmountain, a fountain of molten rock will spout high into the air.\r\nThis has happened on Vesuvius and Etna. But in an eruption of Mauna\r\nLoa, in the Sandwich Islands, an unbroken fountain of lava, from two\r\nhundred to seven hundred feet high and one thousand feet broad, burst\r\nout at the base of the mountain; and again in April, 1888, the same\r\nthing happened on a still grander scale. In this case four fiery\r\nfountains continued to play for several weeks, sometimes throwing\r\nthe glowing lava to a height of one thousand feet in the air. Surely\r\nthere can be no more wonderful or awful sight than this in the world.\r\n\r\nThe volcanoes of Hawaii, the principal island in the Sandwich\r\nIslands, often send forth lava-streams covering an area of over\r\none hundred square miles to a depth of one hundred feet or more;\r\nbut they are discharged quite quietly, like water welling out of a\r\nspring. Repeated flows of this kind, however, have in the course of\r\nages built up a great flat cone six miles high from the floor of the\r\nocean, to form this lofty island, which is larger than Surrey; and\r\nit is calculated that the great volcanic mountain must contain enough\r\nmaterial to cover the whole of the United States with a layer of rock\r\nfifty feet deep.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only on the surface of the land that volcanic eruptions\r\ntake place; for in some cases the outbreak of a submarine eruption\r\nhas been witnessed, and it is highly probable that in past geological\r\nages many large eruptions of this nature have taken place. In the\r\nyear 1783, an eruption took place about thirty miles off the west\r\ncoast of Iceland. An island was built up from which glowing vapour\r\nand smoke came forth; but in a year or less the waves had washed\r\neverything away, leaving only a submerged reef. The island of\r\nSantorin, in the Greek Archipelago, is a partly submerged volcano.\r\n\r\nBut in some cases enormous outpourings of lava have taken place,\r\nnot from volcanoes, but from openings of the ground here and there,\r\nand more usually from long fissures or cracks in the rocks lying at\r\nthe surface. In many cases so much lava has quietly welled out in\r\nthis way that the old features of the landscape have been completely\r\nburied up, and wide plains and plateaux formed over them. Sir A.\r\nGeikie says,--\r\n\r\n   \"Some of the most remarkable examples of this type of volcanic\r\n   structure occur in western North America. Among these that of\r\n   the Snake River plain in Idaho may be briefly described.\r\n\r\n   \"Surrounded on the north and east by lofty mountains, it\r\n   stretches westward as an apparently boundless desert of sand\r\n   and bare sheets of black basalt. A few streams descending into\r\n   the plain from the hills are soon swallowed up and lost. The\r\n   Snake River, however, flows across it, and has cut out of its\r\n   lava bed a series of picturesque gorges and rapids.\r\n\r\n   \"The extent of country which has been flooded with basalt in\r\n   this and adjoining regions of Oregon and Washington has not\r\n   yet been accurately surveyed, but has been estimated to cover\r\n   a larger area than France and Great Britain combined. Looked\r\n   at from any point on its surface, one of these lava plains\r\n   appears as a vast level surface, like that of a lake bottom.\r\n   This uniformity has been produced either by the lava rolling\r\n   over a plain or lake bottom, or by the complete effacement of\r\n   an original, undulating contour of the ground under hundreds of\r\n   feet of lava in successive sheets. The lava, rolling up to the\r\n   base of the mountains, has followed the sinuosities of their\r\n   margin, as the waters of a lake follow its promontories and\r\n   bays.\"\r\n\r\nA few further examples of mud-lavas may be mentioned here. Cotopaxi,\r\na great volcano in Ecuador, South America, with a height of 17,900\r\nfeet, reaches so high into the atmosphere that the higher parts are\r\ncapped with snow. In June, 1877, a great eruption took place, during\r\nwhich the melting of snow and ice gave rise to torrents of mud and\r\nwater, which rushed down the steep sides of the mountain, so that\r\nlarge blocks of ice were hurried along. The villages around to a\r\ndistance of about seventy miles were buried under a deposit of mud,\r\nmixed with blocks of lava, ashes, pieces of wood, etc.\r\n\r\nSometimes a volcano discharges large quantities of mud directly\r\nfrom the crater. In this case the mud is not manufactured by the\r\nvolcano itself, but finds its way through fissures and cracks from\r\nthe bed of the neighbouring sea or rivers to the crater. Thus, in\r\nthe year 1691, Imbaburu, one of the Andes of Quito, sent out floods\r\nof mud containing dead fish, the decay of which caused fever in the\r\nneighbourhood. In the same way the volcanoes of Java have often\r\nburied large tracts of fertile country under a covering of volcanic\r\nmud, thus causing great devastation.\r\n\r\nVast quantities of dust are produced, as already explained, by the\r\npounding action that takes place during an eruption, as portions\r\nof rock in falling down meet others that are being hurled into the\r\nair. Striking instances of this have occurred not far from Great\r\nBritain. Thus in the year 1783, during an eruption of Skaptar Jökull,\r\nso great was the amount of dust thus created that the atmosphere in\r\nIceland was loaded with it for several months. Carried by winds, it\r\neven reached the northern parts of Scotland, and in Caithness so\r\nmuch of it fell that the crops were destroyed. This is remarkable,\r\nconsidering that the distance was six hundred miles. Even in Holland\r\nand Norway there are traces of this great shower of dust from the\r\nIcelandic volcano.\r\n\r\nDuring the fearful eruption of Tomboro, a volcano in the island of\r\nSumbawa, in the Eastern Archipelago, in 1815, the abundance of ashes\r\nand dust ejected caused darkness at midday at Java, three hundred\r\nmiles away, and even there the ground was covered to a depth of\r\nseveral inches. In Sumbawa itself the part of the island joining\r\nthe mountain was entirely desolated, and all the houses destroyed,\r\ntogether with twelve thousand inhabitants. Trees and herbage were\r\noverwhelmed with pumice and volcanic dust. The floating pumice on the\r\nsea around formed a layer two feet, six inches thick, through which\r\nvessels forced their way with difficulty. From such facts as these\r\nit is clear that if in past ages volcanoes have been so powerfully\r\nactive as they are now, we should expect to find lava-flows, dykes,\r\nand great deposits of volcanic ash deposited in water among the\r\nstratified rocks; and such is the case. Many large masses of rock\r\nfamiliar to the geologist, and often forming parts of existing\r\nmountains, are to be accounted for either as great lava-flows, or\r\ndykes that have forced their way in among the strata, or as extensive\r\ndeposits of volcanic ash.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the reader would like to know what the inside of a\r\nvolcanic crater is like during an eruption. Let us, then, take a peep\r\ninto that fearful crater of Kilauea, in the Sandwich Islands. For\r\nthis purpose we cannot do better than follow Miss Bird's admirable\r\ndescription of her adventurous expedition to this crater:--\r\n\r\n   \"The abyss, which really is at a height of four thousand feet,\r\n   on the flank of Mauna Loa, has the appearance of a pit on\r\n   a rolling plain. But such a pit! It is quite nine miles in\r\n   circumference, and at its lowest area--which not long ago fell\r\n   about three hundred feet, just as ice on a pond falls when\r\n   the water below is withdrawn--covers six square miles. The\r\n   depth of the crater varies from eight hundred to one thousand\r\n   feet, according as the molten sea below is at flood or ebb.\r\n   Signs of volcanic activity are present more or less throughout\r\n   its whole depth, and for some distance round its margin, in\r\n   the form of steam-cracks, jets of sulphurous vapour, blowing\r\n   cones, accumulating deposits of acicular crystals of sulphur,\r\n   etc., and the pit itself is constantly rent and shaken by\r\n   earthquakes. Grand eruptions occurred with circumstances\r\n   of indescribable terror and dignity; but Kilauea does not\r\n   limit its activity to these outbursts, but has exhibited its\r\n   marvellous phenomena through all known time in a lake or lakes\r\n   on the southern part of the crater three miles from this side.\r\n\r\n   \"This lake--the _Hale-mau-mau_, or 'House of Everlasting Fire,'\r\n   of the Hawaiian mythology, the abode of the dreaded goddess\r\n   Pele--is approachable with safety, except during an eruption.\r\n   The spectacle, however, varies almost daily; and at times the\r\n   level of the lava in the pit within a pit is so low, and the\r\n   suffocating gases are evolved in such enormous quantities, that\r\n   travellers are unable to see anything. There had been no news\r\n   from it for a week; and as nothing was to be seen but a very\r\n   faint bluish vapour hanging round its margin, the prospect was\r\n   not encouraging.... After more than an hour of very difficult\r\n   climbing, we reached the lowest level of the crater, pretty\r\n   nearly a mile across, presenting from above the appearance\r\n   of a sea at rest; but on crossing it, we found it to be an\r\n   expanse of waves and convolutions of ashy-coloured lava, with\r\n   huge cracks filled up with black iridescent rolls of lava only\r\n   a few weeks old. Parts of it are very rough and ridgy, jammed\r\n   together like field-ice, or compacted by rolls of lava, which\r\n   may have swelled up from beneath; but the largest part of the\r\n   area presents the appearance of huge coiled hawsers, the ropy\r\n   formation of the lava rendering the illusion almost perfect.\r\n   These are riven by deep cracks, which emit hot sulphurous\r\n   vapours....\r\n\r\n   \"As we ascended, the flow became hotter under our feet, as well\r\n   as more porous and glistening. It was so hot that a shower of\r\n   rain hissed as it fell upon it. The crust became increasingly\r\n   insecure, and necessitated our walking in single file with the\r\n   guide in front, to test the security of the footing. I fell\r\n   through several times, and always into holes full of sulphurous\r\n   steam so malignantly acid that my strong dogskin gloves were\r\n   burned through as I raised myself on my hands.\r\n\r\n   \"We had followed the lava-flow for thirty miles up to the\r\n   crater's brink, and now we had toiled over recent lava for\r\n   three hours, and by all calculation were close to the pit; yet\r\n   there was no smoke or sign of fire, and I felt sure that the\r\n   volcano had died out for once for our special disappointment....\r\n\r\n   \"Suddenly, just above, and in front of us, gory drops were\r\n   tossed in the air, and springing forwards we stood on the brink\r\n   of _Hale-mau-mau_, which was about thirty-five feet below\r\n   us. I think we all screamed. I know we all wept; but we were\r\n   speechless, for a new glory and terror had been added to the\r\n   earth. It is the most unutterable of wonderful things. The\r\n   words of common speech are quite useless. It is unimaginable,\r\n   indescribable; a sight to remember for ever; a sight which\r\n   at once took possession of every faculty of sense and soul,\r\n   removing one altogether out of the range of ordinary life.\r\n   Here was the real 'bottomless pit,' 'the fire which is not\r\n   quenched,' 'the place of Hell,' 'the lake which burneth with\r\n   fire and brimstone,' 'the everlasting burnings,' 'the fiery\r\n   sea whose waves are never weary.'[26] There were groanings,\r\n   rumblings, and detonations, rushings, hissings, splashings,\r\n   and the crashing sound of breakers on the coast; but it was\r\n   the surging of fiery waves upon a fiery shore. But what can\r\n   I write? Such words as jets, fountains, waves, spray, convey\r\n   some idea of order and regularity, but here there was none.\r\n   The inner lake, while we stood there, formed a sort of crater\r\n   within itself; the whole lava sea rose about three feet; a\r\n   blowing cone about eight feet high was formed; it was never the\r\n   same two minutes together. And what we saw had no existence\r\n   a month ago, and probably will be changed in every essential\r\n   feature a month hence.... The prominent object was fire in\r\n   motion; but the surface of the double lake was continually\r\n   skimming over for a second or two with a cooled crust of a\r\n   lustrous grey-white, like frosted silver, broken by jagged\r\n   cracks of a bright rose-colour. The movement was nearly always\r\n   from the sides to the centre; but the movement of the centre\r\n   itself appeared independent, and always took a southerly\r\n   direction. Before each outburst of agitation there was much\r\n   hissing and throbbing, internal roaring, as of imprisoned\r\n   gases. Now it seemed furious, demoniacal, as if no power on\r\n   earth could bind it, then playful and sportive, then for a\r\n   second languid, but only because it was accumulating fresh\r\n   force.... Sometimes the whole lake ... took the form of mighty\r\n   waves, and surging heavily against the partial barrier with\r\n   a sound like the Pacific surf, lashed, tore, covered it, and\r\n   threw itself over it in clots of living fire. It was all\r\n   confusion, commotion, forces, terror, glory, majesty, mystery,\r\n   and even beauty. And the colour, 'eye hath not seen' it! Molten\r\n   metal hath not that crimson gleam, nor blood that living\r\n   light.\"[27]\r\n\r\n  [26] Perhaps these Scripture phrases were suggested long before\r\n  the Bible was written, by the sight of some crater in active\r\n  eruption.\r\n\r\n  [27] The Hawaiian Archipelago.\r\n\r\nContinued observation of volcanoes, together with evidence derived\r\nfrom history, teaches that there are different stages of volcanic\r\naction. There are three pretty well-marked phases. First, the state\r\nof permanent eruption; this is not a dangerous state, because the\r\nsteam keeps escaping all the time: the safety-valve is at work, and\r\nall goes smoothly. The second state is one of moderate activity, with\r\nmore or less violent eruptions at brief intervals; this is rather\r\ndangerous, because at times the safety-valve does not work.\r\n\r\nAnd thirdly, we have paroxysms of intense energy, alternating with\r\nlong periods of repose sometimes lasting for centuries. These\r\neruptions are extremely violent, and cause widespread destruction;\r\nthe safety-valve has got jammed, and so the boiler bursts.\r\n\r\nNo volcano has been so carefully watched for a long time as Vesuvius.\r\nIts history illustrates the phases we have just mentioned. The first\r\nrecorded eruption is that of A. D. 79, a very severe one of the\r\nviolent type, by which Herculaneum, Pompeii, and Stabiæ were buried.\r\nWe have an interesting account by the younger Pliny. Before this\r\ngreat eruption took place, Vesuvius had been in a state of repose\r\nfor eight hundred years, and if we may judge from the Greek and Roman\r\nwritings, was not even suspected of being a volcano. Then followed\r\nan interval of rest until the reign of Severus, the second eruption\r\ntaking place in the year 203. In the year 472, says Procopius, all\r\nEurope was covered more or less with volcanic ashes. Other eruptions\r\nfollowed at intervals, but there was complete repose for two\r\ncenturies; that is, until the year 1306. In 1500 it was again active,\r\nthen quiet again for one hundred and thirty years. In 1631 there took\r\nplace another terrific outburst. After this many eruptions followed,\r\nand they have been frequent ever since. Vesuvius is therefore now in\r\nthe second stage of moderate activity.\r\n\r\nBut geologists can take a wider view than this. They can sum up the\r\nhistory of a volcanic region of the earth; and the result is somewhat\r\nas follows: Volcanoes, like living creatures, go through different\r\nperiods or phases, corresponding roughly to youth, middle age, old\r\nage, and finally decay. The invasion of any particular area of the\r\nearth's surface by the volcanic forces is heralded by underground\r\nshocks, or earthquakes. A little later on cracks are formed, as\r\nindicated by the rise of saline and hot springs, and the issuing of\r\ncarbonic acid and other gases at the surface of the earth. As the\r\nunderground activity becomes greater, the temperature of the springs\r\nand emitted gases increases; and at last a visible rent is formed,\r\nexposing highly heated and glowing rock below. From the fissure thus\r\nformed, the gas and vapours imprisoned in the molten rocks escape\r\nwith such violence as to disperse the latter in the form of pumice\r\nand volcanic ash, or to cause them to pour out as lava-streams.\r\n\r\nThe action generally becomes confined to one or more points along the\r\nline of action (which is a line of fissures and cracks). In this way\r\na chain of volcanoes is formed, which may become the seat of volcanic\r\naction for a long time.\r\n\r\nWhen the volcanic energies have become somewhat exhausted, so that\r\nthey cannot raise up the lava and expel it from the volcanic crater,\r\nnor rend the sides of the volcano and cause minor cones to grow up\r\non their flanks, small cones may be formed at a lower level in the\r\nplains around the great central chain. These likewise are fed from\r\nfissures.\r\n\r\nLater on, as the heated rock below cools down, the fissures are\r\nsealed up by lava that has become solid; and then the volcanoes\r\nfall, as it were, into the \"sere and yellow leaf,\" and remain in a\r\npeaceful, quiet state befitting their old age.\r\n\r\nAfter this they begin to suffer from long exposure to the atmospheric\r\ninfluences of decay, and rain and rivers wash them away more or less\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nBut still the presence of heated rocky matter at no great depth\r\nbelow is proved by the outbursts of gases and vapours, the forming\r\nof geysers and ordinary hot springs. Gradually, however, even these\r\nsigns of heat below disappear; and the cycle of volcanic phases is at\r\nan end. Such a series of changes may require millions of years; but\r\nby the study of volcanoes in every stage of their growth and decline\r\nit is possible thus to sketch out an outline of their history.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that in the present state of scientific\r\nknowledge no full and complete explanation of volcanic action is\r\npossible. Geologists and others are as yet but feeling their way\r\ncautiously towards the light which, perhaps before long, will\r\nillumine the dark recesses of this mysterious subject. Many theories\r\nand ideas have been put forward, but in the opinion of the writer the\r\nmost promising explanation is one that may be briefly expressed as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThere are below the crust of the earth large masses of highly\r\nheated rock that are _kept solid_ by the enormous pressure of the\r\noverlying rocks, or otherwise they would melt,--for it is a known\r\nfact that pressure tends to prevent the melting of a solid body. But\r\nwhen earth-movements taking place within the earth's crust--such\r\nas the upheaving of mountain-chains--take off some of the weight,\r\nthe balance between internal heat and the pressure from above is no\r\nlonger maintained; and so these highly heated rocks run off into\r\nthe liquid state, and finding their way to the surface through the\r\nfissures mentioned above, give rise to volcanic action. There is\r\nmuch to be said in favour of this view. It rightly connects volcanic\r\naction with movements of upheaval, with mountain-chains and lines of\r\nweakness in the earth's crust.\r\n\r\nThere is very good reason to believe that the earth was once in a\r\nhighly heated state, and has been slowly cooling down for ages. The\r\nincrease of temperature observed in penetrating mines tells us that\r\nit still retains below the surface some of its old heat. We need not\r\ntherefore be surprised at the existence of heated masses of rock down\r\nbelow, or seek, as some have done, an entirely different source for\r\nthe origin of volcanic heat than that which remains from the earth's\r\nonce molten condition. It would take too long to state the reasons\r\non which this idea of the former state of our planet is based, and\r\nmoreover, it would bring us into the region of astronomy, with which\r\nwe are not concerned at present.\r\n\r\nIn various parts of Great Britain and Ireland we meet with old\r\nvolcanic rocks,--lavas, intrusive dykes, and sheets of basalt, etc.,\r\ntogether with vast deposits of volcanic ash, which, sinking into\r\nthe old neighbouring seas, became stratified, or arranged in layers\r\nlike the ordinary sedimentary rocks. In some cases we see embedded\r\nin these layers the very \"bombs\" that were thrown out by the old\r\nvolcanoes (see page 253). And besides these purely volcanic rocks, we\r\noften meet in these areas with great bosses of granite, which must\r\nhave been in some way connected with the old volcanoes, and probably\r\nwere in many cases the source from which much of the volcanic rock\r\nwas derived. But more than this, in a few instances we have the site\r\nof the old volcano itself marked out by a kind of pipe, or \"neck,\"\r\nnow filled with some of its volcanic débris in the shape of coarse,\r\nrounded fragments (see page 277).\r\n\r\nDuring a very ancient period, known to geologists as the Silurian\r\nPeriod, great lava-flows took place from volcanoes situated where\r\nNorth and South Wales and the Lake District now are; and by their\r\neruptions a vast amount of volcanic ash was made, which fell into\r\nthe sea and slowly sank to the bottom, so that the shell-fish living\r\nthere were buried in the strata thus formed, and may now be seen in a\r\nfossilised condition.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 1. THE RANGES OF THE GREAT BASIN, WESTERN\r\n  STATES OF NORTH AMERICA, SHOWING A SERIES OF GREAT FRACTURES AND\r\n  TILTED MASSES OF ROCK.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 2. SECTION THROUGH SNOWDON.]\r\n\r\nThus Snowdon, Cader Idris, the Arans, Arenig Mountain, and others,\r\nare very largely made up of these ancient volcanic materials. The\r\nwriter has picked up specimens of fossil shell-fish near the summit\r\nof Snowdon from a bed of fine volcanic ash that forms the summit.\r\nFig. 2 represents a section through Snowdon, from which it will be\r\nseen that we have first a few sedimentary strata, _S_, then a great\r\nlava-flow, _L_; and that volcanic ashes accumulated on the top of\r\nthis, of which _A A_ are patches still left. _B_ is an intrusive dyke\r\nof a basaltic rock that forced its way through afterwards. Again, in\r\nthe Lake District there is a well-known volcanic series of stratified\r\nrocks of the same age, consisting mostly of lavas and ashes, the\r\ntotal thickness of which is about twelve thousand feet (known as the\r\n\"Green Slates and Porphyries\"), so that a large part of some of the\r\nmountains there have also been built up by volcanic action; but no\r\ntraces of the old volcanoes remain.\r\n\r\nGoing farther north we find abundant proof that volcanic action on\r\na prodigious scale took place in Scotland during the very ancient\r\nperiod of the Old Red Sandstone, with which the name of Hugh Miller\r\nwill always be associated. In Central Scotland we see lava-flows and\r\nstrata formed of volcanic ash, with a thickness of more than six\r\nthousand feet, fragments of which, having escaped the destructive\r\nagents of denudation, now form important chains of hills, such\r\nas the Pentland, Ochil, and Sidlaw ranges. Nor was the volcanic\r\naction confined to this region. In the district of the Cheviot\r\nHills similar volcanic rocks are to be seen. But here again the old\r\nvolcanoes have long since been swept away, leaving us only portions\r\nof their outpourings buried in the hills.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the present area of the Grampian Hills was\r\nonce the site of a considerable number of volcanoes, only at a much\r\nhigher level than their present surface, elevated though that is to\r\nthe region of the clouds; but in this case subsequent denudation has\r\nbeen so enormous that the old mountain surface has been planed away\r\nuntil all we can now see is a series of separate patches of granite,\r\nthat were once in a fused and highly heated state far below the\r\nsurface, and formed part of the subterranean reservoirs from which\r\nthe volcanoes derived their great supplies of lava and steam. It is\r\nindeed difficult to imagine the enormous amount of denudation which\r\nhas taken place in the Highlands of Scotland, and to realise that the\r\nmagnificent range of the Cairngorms, for instance, has been for ages\r\nworn down until now they are but a remnant of what they once were.\r\n\r\nIn this region we see the once boiling and seething masses of\r\nrock which fed the old volcanoes, now no longer endowed with\r\nlife-like power by the force of steam, but lying in deathlike cold\r\nand stiffness, with their beautiful crystals of mica and felspar\r\nsparkling in the sun. The volcanic fires have died out; but the\r\ntraces of their work are unmistakable, among which we must not forget\r\nto reckon the beautiful minerals made by the action of heated water\r\nupon the surrounding rocks.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful cairngorm stones are still sometimes found on the\r\nmountain from which they take their name, and in all volcanic regions\r\nminerals are plentiful.\r\n\r\nThe well-known hill called Arthur's Seat, close to Edinburgh, marks\r\nthe site of an old volcano. The \"neck,\" or central opening, may be\r\nseen at the top of the hill, but choked up with volcanic rocks and\r\ndébris. The crater has long since disappeared, but Salisbury Craigs\r\nand St. Leonard's Craigs are formed of a great sheet of basalt that\r\nintruded itself among the stratified rocks that had been formed\r\nthere, and so belong really to a great intrusive dyke. In the Castle\r\nRock we see the same basalt again.\r\n\r\nDuring a much later age, known as the Miocene Period (see chap. x.,\r\np. 324), enormous outpourings of lava took place in Western Europe,\r\ncovering hundreds of square miles. Of these the most important is\r\nthat which occupies a large part of the northeast of Ireland, and\r\nextends in patches through the Inner Hebrides and the Faröe Islands\r\ninto Iceland. These eruptive rocks, unlike those above referred to,\r\nmust have poured out at the surface, and have taken the form of\r\nsuccessive sheets, such as we now see in the terraced plateaux of\r\nSkye, Eigg, Canna, Muck, Mull, and Morven. These, then, are patches\r\nof what once formed a great plain of basalt. During later times\r\nthis volcanic platform has been so greatly cut up by the agents of\r\ndenudation that it has been reduced to mere scattered fragments;\r\nthousands of feet of basalt have been worn away from it; deep and\r\nwide valleys have been carved out of it; and in many cases it has\r\nbeen almost entirely stripped off from the wide areas it once\r\ncovered. Where, as in the Isle of Eigg, the lava has been piled up\r\nin successive sheets, with some layers of volcanic ash between, the\r\nlatter has been worn away rather faster than the hard layers of\r\nbasalt, and each lava-flow is clearly marked by a terrace. These\r\nvolcanic eruptions have thus had a great influence in moulding the\r\nscenery of this region. In Ireland the old basalts are well seen at\r\nthe Giant's Causeway, and on the Scottish coast we see them again at\r\nthe well-known Fingal's cave at Staffa. This island, like the others,\r\nis just a patch of the old lava-streams.\r\n\r\nIts curious six-sided columns illustrate a fact with regard to the\r\nsubsequent cooling of lava-flows. Some internal forces, analogous to\r\nthat which regulates the shapes of crystals, have caused it to crack\r\nalong three sets of lines, so placed with regard to each other as to\r\nproduce six-sided columns.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland the basalts attain a thickness of nine hundred feet; in\r\nMull they are about three thousand feet thick. It has been clearly\r\nproved that Mull is the site of one of the old volcanoes of this\r\nperiod, but very few others have as yet been detected. Perhaps the\r\neruptions took place mainly from large fissures, instead of from\r\nvolcanic cones, for it is known that the ground below the lava-sheets\r\nhas been rent by earthquakes into innumerable fissures, into which\r\nthe basalt was injected from below.\r\n\r\nIn this way a vast number of \"dykes\" were formed. These have been\r\ntraced by hundreds eastwards from this region across Scotland,\r\nand even the north of England. In this case the molten rock was\r\nstruggling to get through the overlying rocks and escape at the\r\nsurface; but apparently it did not succeed in so doing, for we do not\r\nfind lava-flows to the east and south. These basalt dykes are found\r\nas far south as Yorkshire, and can be traced over an area of one\r\nhundred thousand square miles.\r\n\r\nIt is thus evident that in the Miocene Period a great and extensive\r\nmass of molten basalt was underlying a large part of the British\r\nIsles, and probably the weight of the thick rocks overlying it was\r\nsufficient to prevent its escape to the surface. If it had succeeded\r\nin so escaping and overflowing, how different the scenery of much of\r\nScotland and Northern England might have been!\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: COLUMNAR BASALT AT CLAMSHELL CAVE, STAFFA. FROM A\r\n  PHOTOGRAPH BY J. VALENTINE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAIN ARCHITECTURE.\r\n\r\n    The splendour falls on castle walls\r\n      And snowy summits old in story;\r\n    The long light shakes across the lakes,\r\n      And the wild cataract leaps in glory.\r\n    Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying;\r\n    Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.\r\n\r\n    TENNYSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dying splendours of the sun slowly sinking and entering the\r\n\"gates of the West\" may well serve as a fitting emblem of the\r\nmountains in their beautiful old age, awaiting in silent and calm\r\ndignity the time when they also must be brought low, and sink in the\r\nwaters of the ocean, as the sun appears daily to do. Yes, they too\r\nhave their day. They too had their rising, when mighty forces brought\r\nthem up out of their watery bed. Many of them have passed their\r\nhey-day of youth, and their midday; while others, far advanced in old\r\nage, are nearing the end of their course.\r\n\r\nBut as the sun rises once more over eastern seas to begin another\r\nday, so will the substance of the mountains be again heaved up after\r\na long, long rest under the sea, and here and there will rise up from\r\nthe plains to form the lofty mountain-ranges of a distant future.\r\n\r\nEverywhere we read the same story, the same circle of changes. The\r\nAlpine peak that proudly rears its head to the clouds must surely\r\nbe brought low, and finally come back to the same ocean from which\r\nthose clouds arose. It is in this way that the balance between land\r\nand water is preserved. In passing through such a great circle of\r\nchanges, the mountains assume various forms and shapes which are\r\ndetermined by:--\r\n\r\n   1. Their different ages and states of decay.\r\n\r\n   2. The different kinds of rocks of which they are composed, and\r\n   especially by their \"joints,\" or natural divisions.\r\n\r\n   3. The different positions into which these rocky layers have\r\n   been squeezed, pushed, and crumpled by those stupendous forces\r\n   of upheaval of which we spoke in chapter vi.\r\n\r\nLet us therefore glance at some of these external forms, and then\r\nlook at the internal structure of mountains.\r\n\r\nIn so doing we shall find that we have yet a good deal more to learn\r\nabout mountains and how they were made; and also we shall then be in\r\na better position to realise not only how very much denudation they\r\nhave suffered, but also how greatly they have been disturbed since\r\ntheir rocks were first made.\r\n\r\nEvery one who knows mountains must have observed how some are smooth\r\nand rounded, others sharp and jagged, with peaks and pinnacles\r\nstanding out clearly against the sky; some square and massive, with\r\nsteep walls forming precipices; others again spread out widely at\r\ntheir base, but the sloping sides end in a sharp point at the top,\r\ngiving to the mountain the appearance of a cone. Their diversities of\r\nshape are so endless that we cannot attempt to describe them all.\r\n\r\nFirst, with regard to the general features of mountains. Looked\r\nat broadly, a mountain-range is not a mere line of hills or\r\nmountains rising straight up from a plain on each side, such as\r\nschool-boys often draw in their maps; very far from it. Take the\r\nRocky Mountains, for instance. \"It has been truly said of the Rocky\r\nMountains that the word 'range' does not express it at all. It is a\r\nwhole country populous with mountains. It is as if an ocean of molten\r\ngranite had been caught by instant petrifaction when its billows were\r\nrolling heaven high.\"[28]\r\n\r\n  [28] \"The Crest of the Continent,\" by Ernest Ingersoll, Chicago,\r\n  1885.\r\n\r\nIt has often been observed by mountain climbers that when they get\r\nto the top of a high mountain, and take a bird's-eye view of the\r\ncountry, all the mountain-tops seem to reach to about the same\r\nheight, so that a line joining them would be almost level. For this\r\nreason, perhaps, writers so often compare them to the waves of an\r\nocean. This feature is very conspicuous in the case of the Scotch\r\nHighlands.\r\n\r\nSir A. Geikie has well described what he saw from the top of Ben\r\nNevis:--\r\n\r\n   \"Much has been said and written about the wild, tumbled sea of\r\n   the Highland Hills. But as he sits on his high perch, does it\r\n   not strike the observer that there is after all a wonderful\r\n   orderliness, and even monotony, in the waves of that wide\r\n   sea? And when he has followed their undulations from north to\r\n   south, all round the horizon, does it not seem to him that\r\n   these mountain-tops and ridges tend somehow to rise to a\r\n   general level; that, in short, there is not only on the great\r\n   scale a marked similarity of contour about them, but a still\r\n   more definite uniformity of average height? To many who have\r\n   contented themselves with the bottom of the glen, and have\r\n   looked with awe at the array of peaks and crags overhead, this\r\n   statement will doubtless appear incredible. But let any one get\r\n   fairly up to the summits and look along them, and he will not\r\n   fail to see that the statement is nevertheless true. From the\r\n   top of Ben Nevis this feature is impressively seen. Along the\r\n   sky-line, the wide sweep of summits undulates up to a common\r\n   level, varied here by a cone and there by the line of some\r\n   strath or glen, but yet wonderfully persistent round the whole\r\n   panorama. If, as sometimes happens in these airy regions, a\r\n   bank of cloud with a level under-surface should descend upon\r\n   the mountains, it will be seen to touch summit after summit,\r\n   the long line of the cloud defining, like a great parallel\r\n   ruler, the long level line of the ridges below. I have seen\r\n   this feature brought out with picturesque vividness over the\r\n   mountains of Knoydart and Glen Garry. Wreaths of filmy mist had\r\n   been hovering in the upper air during the forenoon. Towards\r\n   evening, under the influence of a cool breeze from the north,\r\n   they gathered together into one long band that stretched for\r\n   several miles straight as the sky-line of the distant sea,\r\n   touching merely the higher summits and giving a horizon by\r\n   which the general uniformity of level among the hills could be\r\n   signally tested. Once or twice in a season one may be fortunate\r\n   enough to get on the mountains above such a stratum of mist,\r\n   which then seems to fill up the irregularities of the general\r\n   platform of hill-tops, and to stretch out as a white phantom\r\n   sea, from which the highest eminences rise up as little islets\r\n   into the clear air of the morning.... Still more striking\r\n   is the example furnished by the great central mass of the\r\n   Grampians, comprising the Cairngorm Mountains and the great\r\n   corries and precipices round the head of the Dee. This tract\r\n   of rugged ground, when looked at from a distance, is found to\r\n   present the character of a high, undulating plateau.\"[29]\r\n\r\n  [29] Scenery of Scotland page 130, new edition.\r\n\r\nThis long level line of the Highland mountain-tops may be seen very\r\nwell from the lower country outside; for example, from the isles of\r\nSkye and Eigg, where one may see the panorama between the heights of\r\nApplecross and the Point of Ardnamurchan showing very clearly the\r\ntraces of the old table-land.\r\n\r\nHow are we to explain this curious fact, so opposed to our first\r\nimpressions of a mountain region? It is quite clear that the\r\nold plateau thus marked out cannot be caused by the arrangement\r\nor position of the rocks of which the Highlands are composed. If\r\nthese rocks were found to be lying pretty evenly in flat layers,\r\nor strata, undisturbed by great earth-movements, we could readily\r\nunderstand that they would form a plateau. But the reverse is the\r\ncase: the rocks are everywhere thrown into folds, and frequently\r\ngreatly displaced by \"faults;\" yet these important geological\r\nfeatures have little or no connection with the external aspect of the\r\ncountry. It is therefore useless to look to internal structure for\r\nan explanation. We must look outside, and consider what has been for\r\nages and ages taking place here.\r\n\r\nAs already pointed out, an enormous amount of solid rock has been\r\nremoved from this region--thousands and thousands of feet. It was\r\nlong ago planed down by the action of water, so that a table-land\r\nonce existed of which the tops of the present mountains are isolated\r\nfragments. No other conclusion is possible. To the geologist every\r\nhill and valley throughout the whole length and breadth of the\r\nHighlands bears striking testimony to this enormous erosion. The\r\nexplanation we are seeking may therefore be summed up in one word,\r\n\"denudation.\" The valleys that now intersect the table-land have been\r\ncarved out of it. If we could in imagination put back again onto\r\nthe present surface what has been removed, we should have a mental\r\npicture of the Highlands as a wide, undulating table-land; and this\r\nrolling plain would suggest the bottom of the sea. The long flat\r\nsurfaces of the Highland ridges, cut across the edges of inclined\r\nor even upright strata, are the fragments of a former base-line of\r\nerosion; that is, they represent the general submarine level to which\r\nthe Highlands were reduced after exposure to the action of \"rain and\r\nrivers,\" and finally of the sea. As the sea gradually spread over it,\r\nit planed down everything that had not been previously worn away, and\r\nso reduced the whole surface to one general level like the sea-bed of\r\nthe present day. But it is not necessary to suppose that the whole\r\nregion was under water at the same time, and it is probable that\r\nthere were separate inland seas or lakes. In these the rocks of the\r\nOld Red Sandstone were formed; and they in their turn have suffered\r\nso much denudation that only patches and long strips of them are left\r\non the borders of the Highlands.\r\n\r\nBefore we speak of individual mountains and their shapes, it is\r\nimportant to bear in mind another fact about mountain-chains;\r\nnamely, that they are very low in proportion to their breadth and\r\nlength. The great heights reached by some mountains produce such a\r\npowerful impression on our senses that we hardly realise how very\r\ninsignificant they really are. It is only by drawing them on a true\r\nscale that we can realise this. The surface of the earth is so vast\r\nthat even the highest mountains are in proportion but as the little\r\nroughnesses on the skin of an orange. Fig. 2 (see chap, vii., p. 236)\r\nrepresents a section through the Highlands, drawn on the same scale\r\nfor height as for length.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat has been said about the Highland plateau applies equally well\r\nto many other mountain-ranges. Mr. Ruskin observed something rather\r\nsimilar in the Alps. He says,--\r\n\r\n   \"The longer I stayed in the Alps, and the more closely I\r\n   examined them, the more I was struck by the one broad fact of\r\n   there being a vast Alpine plateau, or mass of elevated land,\r\n   upon which nearly all the highest peaks stood like children set\r\n   upon a table, removed, in most cases, far back from the edge\r\n   of the plateau, as if for fear of their falling; ... and for\r\n   the most part the great peaks are not allowed to come to the\r\n   edge of it, but remain like the keeps of castles, withdrawn,\r\n   surrounded league beyond league by comparatively level fields\r\n   of mountains, over which the lapping sheets of glaciers writhe\r\n   and flow, foaming about the feet of the dark central crests\r\n   like the surf of an enormous sea-breaker hurled over a rounded\r\n   rock and islanding some fragment of it in the midst. And the\r\n   result of this arrangement is a kind of division of the whole\r\n   of Switzerland into an upper and a lower mountain world,--the\r\n   lower world consisting of rich valleys, bordered by steep but\r\n   easily accessible, wooded banks of mountain, more or less\r\n   divided by ravines, through which glimpses are caught of the\r\n   higher Alps; the upper world, reached after the first steep\r\n   banks of three thousand or four thousand feet in height have\r\n   been surmounted, consisting of comparatively level but most\r\n   desolate tracts of moor and rock, half covered by glacier, and\r\n   stretching to the feet of the true pinnacles of the chain.\"\r\n\r\nHe then points out the wisdom of this arrangement, and shows how it\r\nprotects the inhabitants from falling blocks and avalanches; and\r\nmoreover, the masses of snow, if cast down at once into the warmer\r\nair, would melt too fast and cause furious inundations.\r\n\r\nAll the various kinds of rocks are differently affected by the\r\natmospheric influences of decay, and so present different external\r\nappearances and shapes, so that after a little experience the\r\ngeologist can recognize the presence of certain rocks by the kind\r\nof scenery they produce; and this knowledge is often of great use\r\nin helping him to unravel the geological structure of a difficult\r\nregion. Thus granite, crystalline schists, slates, sandstones, and\r\nlimestones, all \"weather\" in their own ways, and moreover split up\r\ndifferently, because their joints and other natural lines of division\r\nrun in different ways.\r\n\r\nThus granite is jointed very regularly, some of the joints running\r\nstraight down and others running horizontally, so that the rain and\r\natmosphere seize on these lines and widen them very considerably; and\r\nthus the granite is weathered out either in tall upright columns,\r\nlike those seen at Land's End, or else into great square-shaped\r\nblocks with their corners rounded off, presenting the appearance\r\nof a number of knapsacks lying one over the other. In this way\r\nwe can account for the well-known \"Tors\" of Devonshire, and the\r\n\"Rocking Stones.\" Granite weathers rapidly along its joints, and\r\nits surfaces crumble away more rapidly than might be expected,\r\nconsidering how hard a rock it is; but the felspar which is its chief\r\nmineral constituent is readily decomposed by rain water, which acts\r\nchemically upon it. The deposits of China clay in Devonshire are\r\nthe result of the decomposition and washing away of the granite of\r\nDartmoor.\r\n\r\nGranite mountains are generally rounded and \"bossy,\" breaking now\r\nand then into cliffs, the faces of which are riven by huge joints,\r\nand present a very different appearance from those composed of\r\ncrystalline schists with their sharp crests and peaks. Ben Nevis and\r\nthe Cairngorms are partly composed of granite.\r\n\r\nGneiss is a rock composed of the same minerals as granite; namely,\r\nmica, quartz, and felspar. And yet mountains composed of this rock\r\nhave quite a different aspect, and sometimes, as in the Alps, produce\r\nvery sharp and jagged pinnacles. The reason of this is that gneiss\r\nsplits in a different way from granite, because its minerals are\r\narranged in layers, and so it is more like a crystalline schist.\r\n\r\nMica-schist is another rock very abundant in mountain regions. This\r\nrock is composed of quartz and mica arranged in wavy layers. The\r\nmica, which is very conspicuous, lies in thin plates, sometimes\r\nso dovetailed into each other as to form long continuous layers\r\nseparating it from those of the quartz; and it readily splits along\r\nthe layers of mica. This mineral is easily recognised by its bright,\r\nshiny surface. There are, however, two varieties,--one of a light\r\ncolour and the other black.\r\n\r\nMica-schist and gneiss are often found in the same region, and are\r\nthe materials of which most of the highest peaks in Europe are\r\ncomposed. We find them abounding in the district of Mont Blanc; and\r\nall the monarch's attendant _aiguilles_, with the splintered ridges\r\nenclosing the great snowfields in the heart of the chain, consist\r\nmostly of these two rocks. The Matterhorn, Weisshorn, Monte Viso, the\r\nGrand Paradis, the Aiguille Verte and Aiguille du Dru are examples of\r\nthe wonderful forms produced by the breaking up and decay of these\r\ntwo rocks.\r\n\r\nThe different varieties of slate split in a very marked way. Slates\r\nare often associated with the schists, and exert their influence in\r\nmodifying the scenery.\r\n\r\nLimestone ranges, though less striking in the outlines of their\r\ncrests than those composed of slates and crystalline schists, and not\r\nreaching to such heights, are nevertheless not at all inferior in the\r\ngrandeur of their cliffs, which frequently extend for miles along the\r\nside of a valley in vast terraces, whose precipitous walls are often\r\nabsolutely inaccessible. The beauty of limestone mountains is often\r\nenhanced by the rich pastures and forests which clothe their lower\r\nslopes. The dolomitic limestone of the Italian Tyrol, being gashed by\r\nenormous vertical joints and at the same time having been formed in\r\nrather thin layers which break up into small blocks, produces some\r\nvery striking scenery. But wild as these mountainous ridges may be,\r\ntheir forms can never be confounded with those of the crystalline\r\nschists; for however sharp their pinnacles may appear at first sight,\r\ncareful examination will always show that their outline is that\r\nof ruined masonry, suggesting crumbling battlements and tottering\r\nturrets, and not the curving, flame-like crests and splintered peaks\r\nof the crystalline schists.[30]\r\n\r\n  [30] Bonney.\r\n\r\nIt has already been explained that all sedimentary rocks have been\r\nformed under water in layers or strata, and it must be obvious\r\nthat the stratification of such rocks has an important influence\r\non scenery; and very much depends on whether the strata have been\r\nleft undisturbed, with perhaps just a slight slope, or whether they\r\nhave been folded and crumpled; for the position of the strata, or\r\n\"bedding,\" as it is called,--whether flat, inclined, vertical, or\r\ncontorted,--largely determines the nature of the surface. Undoubtedly\r\nthe most characteristic scenery formed by stratified rocks is to be\r\nseen in those places where the \"bedding\" is horizontal, or nearly so,\r\nand the strata are massive. A mountain constructed of such materials\r\nappears as a colossal pyramid, the level lines of stratification\r\nlooking like great courses of masonry. The joints that cut across the\r\nstrata allow it to be cleft into great blocks and deep chasms; so\r\nthat, as in the case of the dolomitic limestone above mentioned, we\r\nfind a resemblance to ruined buildings.\r\n\r\nWe cannot find a better example of this in our own country than the\r\nmountains of sandstone and conglomerate (of the Cambrian age) that\r\nhere and there lie on the great platform of old gneiss in the west of\r\nSutherland and Ross. Sir A. Geikie says,--\r\n\r\n   \"The bleak, bare gneiss, with its monotonous undulations,\r\n   tarns, and bogs, is surmounted by groups of cones, which for\r\n   individuality of form and independence of position better\r\n   deserve to be called mountains than most of the eminences to\r\n   which that name is given in Scotland. These huge pyramids,\r\n   rising to heights of between two thousand and four thousand\r\n   feet, consist of dark red strata, so little inclined that\r\n   their edges can be traced by the eye in long, level bars on\r\n   the steeper hillsides and precipices, like lines of masonry.\r\n   Here and there the hand of time has rent them into deep rifts,\r\n   from which long 'screes' (slopes of loose stones) descend into\r\n   the plains below, as stones are detached from the shivered\r\n   walls of an ancient battlement. Down their sides, which have in\r\n   places the steepness of a bastion, vegetation finds but scanty\r\n   room along the projecting ledges of the sandstone beds, where\r\n   the heath and grass and wildflowers cluster over the rock in\r\n   straggling lines and tufts of green; and yet, though nearly as\r\n   bare as the gneiss below them, these lofty mountains are far\r\n   from presenting the same aspect of barrenness. The prevailing\r\n   colour of their component strata gives them a warm red hue,\r\n   which even at noon contrasts strongly with the grey of the\r\n   platform of older rock.... These huge isolated cones are among\r\n   the most striking memorials of denudation anywhere to be seen\r\n   in the British Isles. Quinag, Canisp, Suilven, Coulmore, and\r\n   the hills of Coygoch, Dundonald, Loch Maree, and Torridon are\r\n   merely detached patches of a formation not less than seven\r\n   thousand or eight thousand feet thick, which once spread\r\n   over the northwest of Scotland. The spaces between them were\r\n   once occupied by the same dull red sandstone; the horizontal\r\n   stratification of one hill, indeed, is plainly continuous with\r\n   that of the others, though deep and wide valleys, or miles\r\n   of low moorland, may now lie between. While the valleys have\r\n   been worn down through the sandstone, these strange pyramidal\r\n   mountains that form so singular a feature in the landscapes of\r\n   the northwest highlands have been left standing, like lonely\r\n   sea-stacks, as monuments of long ages of waste.\"[31]\r\n\r\n  [31] Scenery of Scotland, page 201, new edition.\r\n\r\nAgain, the vast table-lands of the Colorado region illustrate on\r\na truly magnificent scale, to which there is no parallel in the\r\nOld World, the effects of atmospheric erosion on undisturbed and\r\nnearly level strata. Here we find valleys and river gorges deeper\r\nand longer than any others in the world; great winding lines of\r\nescarpment, like ranges of sea cliffs; terraced slopes rising at\r\nvarious levels; huge buttresses and solitary monuments, standing like\r\nislands out of the plains; and lastly, great mountain masses carved\r\nout into the most striking and picturesque shapes, yet with their\r\nlines of \"bedding\" clearly marked out.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, where, as is almost always the case in\r\nmountain-ranges, the stratified rocks have been folded, crumpled,\r\ntwisted, and fractured by great \"faults,\" we find a very different\r\nresult. In these cases the rocks have generally been very much\r\naltered by the action of heat. For here we find crystalline schists,\r\ngneiss, granite, and other rocks in the formation of which heat has\r\nplayed an important part; and very often the igneous rocks have\r\nforced their way through those of sedimentary origin and altered them\r\ninto what are called metamorphic rocks (see chapter v., page 156).\r\nThus they have lost much of their original character and structure.\r\n\r\nThe repeated uplifts and subsidences of the earth's crust, by which\r\nthe continents of the world have been raised up out of the sea\r\nto form dry land, have, broadly speaking, thrown the rocky strata\r\ninto a series of wave-like undulations. In some extensive regions\r\nthese undulations are so broad and low that the curvature is quite\r\nimperceptible, and the strata appear to lie in horizontal layers, or\r\nto slope very slightly in a certain direction. This is, in a general\r\nway, the position of the strata of which plains and plateaux are\r\ncomposed.\r\n\r\nBut in the longer and comparatively narrow mountain regions that\r\ntraverse each of the great continents, forming, as it were, backbones\r\nto them, the undulations are very much more frequent, narrower, and\r\nhigher. Sometimes the rocks have been thrown into huge open waves, or\r\nthe folds are closely crowded together, so that the strata stand on\r\ntheir ends, or are even completely overturned, and thus their proper\r\norder of succession is reversed, and the older ones actually lie on\r\nthe top of the newer ones.\r\n\r\nAs we approach a great mountain-chain we observe many minor ridges\r\nand smaller chains running roughly parallel with it, and, as it\r\nwere, foreshadowing the great folds met with in the centre of the\r\nchain and among its highest peaks. These small folds become sharper\r\nand closer the nearer we get to the main chain, and evidently were\r\nformed by the same movements that uplifted the higher ranges beyond;\r\nbut the force was not so great. Thus we find the great Alpine chain\r\nflanked to the north by the smaller ranges of the Jura Mountains; and\r\non the south, side of the Himalayas we find similar smaller ranges of\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nRuskin thus describes his impression of the Jura ranges, which he\r\nvery aptly compares with a swell on the sea far away from a storm,\r\nthe storm being represented by the wild sea of Alpine mountains:--\r\n\r\n   \"Among the hours of his life to which the writer looks back\r\n   with peculiar gratitude, as having been marked with more\r\n   than ordinary fulness of joy or clearness of teaching, is\r\n   one passed, now some years ago, near time of sunset, among\r\n   the masses of pine forest which skirt the course of the Ain,\r\n   above the village of Champagnole, in the Jura. It is a spot\r\n   which has all the solemnity, with none of the savageness, of\r\n   the Alps; where there is a sense of a great power beginning\r\n   to be manifested in the earth, and of a deep and majestic\r\n   concord in the rise of the long low lines of piny hills,--the\r\n   first utterance of those mighty mountain symphonies, soon to\r\n   be more loudly lifted and wildly broken along the battlements\r\n   of the Alps. But their strength is as yet restrained; and the\r\n   far-reaching ridges of pastoral mountain succeed each other,\r\n   like the long and sighing swell which moves over quiet waters\r\n   from some far-off stormy sea.\r\n\r\n   \"And there is a deep tenderness pervading that vast monotony.\r\n   The destructive forces and the stern expression of the central\r\n   ranges are alike withdrawn. No frost-ploughed, dust-encumbered\r\n   paths of ancient glacier fret the soft Jura pastures; no\r\n   splintered heaps of ruin break the fair ranks of her forests;\r\n   no pale, defiled, or furious rivers rend their rude and\r\n   changeful ways among her rocks. Patiently, eddy by eddy, the\r\n   clear green streams wind along their well-known beds; and under\r\n   the dark quietness of the undisturbed pines there spring up,\r\n   year by year, such company of joyful flowers as I know not the\r\n   like among all the blessings of the earth.\"\r\n\r\nLong faults, or fractures, where the strata have been first bent\r\nand then broken, and afterwards have been forced up or have slid\r\ndown hundreds or even thousands of feet, are very numerous in\r\nmountain-ranges; and by suddenly bringing quite a different set of\r\nrocks to the surface, these faults cause considerable difficulty to\r\nthe geologist, as he goes over the ground and endeavours to trace the\r\npositions of the different rocks.\r\n\r\nIn these vast folds it sometimes happens that portions of older (and\r\nlower) strata are caught up and so embedded among those of newer\r\nrocks. It will therefore be readily perceived that to unravel the\r\ngeological structure of a great mountain-chain is no easy task.\r\nWe need not then be surprised if in some cases the arrangement of\r\nthe rocks of mountains is not thoroughly understood. The wonder\r\nis, when we think of the numerous difficulties which the geologist\r\nencounters,--the arduous ascents, the precipices, glaciers,\r\nsnowfields obscuring the rocks from his view, the overlying soil\r\nof the lower parts, and the steep crests and dangerous ridges that\r\nseparate the snowfields,--that so much has already been discovered in\r\nthis difficult branch of geology.\r\n\r\nHowever, the general arrangement of the rocks of which many\r\nmountain-chains are composed has been satisfactorily made out in not\r\na few cases. Let us look into some of these and see what has been\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nYou will remember the structure of the Weald, described in chap.\r\nvii., pp. 235-238, and how we showed that a great low arch of chalk\r\nstrata has been entirely removed over that area, so that at the\r\npresent time only its ends are seen forming the escarpments of the\r\nNorth and South Downs. This area, then, is now a great open valley,\r\nor rather a gently undulating plain enclosed by low chalk hills. Now,\r\nan arch of this kind is called an \"anticline,\" and it might have been\r\nexpected that it would have remained more or less unbroken to the\r\npresent day. Why, then, has it suffered destruction?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, chalk is a soft rock, and one that rain water can\r\ndissolve; but more than that, its arch-like structure was against it,\r\nand its chance of preservation was decidedly small. In architecture\r\nthe arch is the most firm and stable structure that can be made; but\r\nnot so with strata, and this is the reason. Such an arch was not made\r\nof separate blocks, closely fitting and firmly cemented together;\r\non the contrary, the arch was stretched and heaved up from below.\r\nIt therefore must have been more or less cracked up; for rocks are\r\napt to split when bent, although when deeply buried under a great\r\nthickness of overlying rocks, they will bend very considerably\r\nwithout snapping. But this was not the case here. And so the forces\r\nof denudation set to work upon an already somewhat broken mass of\r\nrock. Try to picture to yourself this old low arch of chalk as it was\r\nwhen it first appeared as dry land. Probably some of it had already\r\nbeen planed away by the waves of the sea, and what was left was by\r\nno means well calculated to withstand the action of the agents of\r\ndenudation. If you look back to the figure, you will see the dotted\r\nlines showing the former outline of this anticline, or arch, and you\r\nperceive at once that the strata must have been sloping outwards away\r\nfrom the middle. Now, this one fact greatly influenced its fate, for\r\nan anticline cannot be regarded as a strong or stable arrangement\r\nof strata. It is easy to see why; suppose a little portion were cut\r\naway on one side at its base by some stream. It is clear that a kind\r\nof overhanging cliff would be left, and blocks of chalk would sooner\r\nor later come rolling down into the valley of the little stream.\r\nWhen these had fallen, they would leave an inclined plane down which\r\nothers would follow; and this would continue to take place until the\r\ntop of the arch was reached. The same reasoning applies to the other\r\nside. It is very seldom that arches, or anticlines, can last for a\r\nlong time. The outward slope of the strata and their broken condition\r\nare against them.\r\n\r\nBut when the rocks dip _inwards_, to form a kind of trough or basin,\r\nit is just the opposite. Such basins are known as \"synclines;\" and\r\na structure of this kind can be shown to be much more stable and\r\npermanent than an anticline. The strata, instead of being stretched\r\nout and cracked open, have been squeezed together.\r\n\r\nIt is very important to bear this in mind, and to remember how\r\ndifferently anticlines and synclines are affected; for this simple\r\nrule is illustrated over and over again in mountain-ranges:--\r\n\r\n   Anticlines, being unstable, are worn away until they become\r\n   valleys.\r\n\r\n   Synclines, being stable, are left and frequently form mountains.\r\n\r\nNow look at the section through the Appalachian chain (see Fig.\r\n1), and you will see that each hill is a syncline, and the valleys\r\nbetween them are anticlines. This happens so frequently that almost\r\nevery range of mountains furnishes examples; but as every rule has\r\nits exceptions, so this one has, and we may find an example in the\r\ncase of the Jura Mountains outside the Alps.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the section that the ridges are formed by\r\nanticlines, and the valleys by synclines. But on looking a little\r\nmore closely, we see that the tops of the former have suffered a\r\nconsiderable amount of erosion (as indicated by the dotted lines).\r\nNow, the reason why they have not been completely worn down into\r\nvalleys is that these rocks were once covered by others overlying\r\nthem, so that this outer covering of rocks had first to be removed\r\nbefore they could be attacked by rain and rivers. These wave-like\r\nridges of the Jura are being slowly worn down; and the time must\r\ncome when they will be carved out into valleys, while the synclines\r\nbetween them will stand out as hills. It is simply a question of\r\ntime. But many mountain-chains have a far more complicated structure\r\nthan that of the Appalachians, and consist of violently crumpled and\r\nfolded strata (see section of Mont Blanc, Fig. 3).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SECTIONS OF MOUNTAIN-RANGES, SHOWING THEIR\r\n  STRUCTURE AND THE AMOUNT OF ROCK WORN AWAY.]\r\n\r\nIt might naturally be asked how such sections are made, considering\r\nthat we cannot cut through mountains in order to find out their\r\nstructure; but Nature cuts them up for us, gashing their sides with\r\nravines and valleys carved out by streams and rivers, and in steep\r\ncliffs and precipices we find great natural sections that serve our\r\npurpose almost equally well. Sometimes, however, we get considerable\r\nhelp from quarries and railway-cuttings.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, one of the synclinal folds in the Appalachian\r\nchain. Its structure is ascertained somewhat as follows. Suppose you\r\nbegan to ascend the hill, armed with a good map, a pocket-compass, a\r\nclinometer,--a little instrument for measuring the angles at which\r\nstrata dip or slope,--and with a bag on your back for specimens\r\nof rocks and fossils. At the base of the hill you might notice at\r\nstarting a certain layer of rock--say a limestone--exposed by the\r\nside of the stream. It will be so many feet thick, and will contain\r\nsuch-and-such fossils, by means of which you can identify it; and\r\nit will dip into the interior of the hill at a certain angle, as\r\nmeasured by the clinometer. As you rise higher, this rock may be\r\nsucceeded by sandstone of a certain thickness, and likewise dipping\r\ninto the hill; and so with the other rocks that follow, until you\r\nreach the summit.\r\n\r\nBy the time you have reached the top of the hill, you know the nature\r\nof all the rocks up that side, and the way they dip; and all your\r\nobservations are carefully recorded in a notebook. Then you begin\r\nto descend on the other side, and in so doing you find the same set\r\nof rocks coming out at the surface all in the same order; only this\r\norder is now reversed, because you are following them downwards\r\ninstead of upwards. Of course they are hidden in many places by soil\r\nand loose stones; but that does not matter, because at other places\r\nthey are exposed to view, especially along ravines, carved out of\r\nthe mountain-side. Also rocks \"weather\" so differently that they can\r\noften be distinguished even at a distance.\r\n\r\nIn this kind of way you can find out the structure of a mountain,\r\nand draw a section of it when you get home, by following out and\r\ncompleting the curves of the strata as indicated at or near the\r\nsurface; and you find they fit in nicely together.\r\n\r\nFig. 3 (see page 307) represents what is believed to be the general\r\narrangement of the rocks of Mont Blanc. The section is greatly\r\nsimplified, because many minor folds and all the faults, or\r\ndislocations, are omitted. Now, in this case we have an example of\r\nwhat is known as the \"fan-structure.\" It will be seen at once that\r\nthe folds have been considerably squeezed together; and the big fold\r\nin the centre indicated by dotted lines has been so much compressed\r\nin the lower part--that is, in what is now Mont Blanc--that its sides\r\nwere brought near to each other until they actually sloped inwards\r\ninstead of outwards.\r\n\r\nYou may easily imitate this structure by taking a sheet of paper,\r\nlaying it on the table, and then, putting one hand on each side of\r\nit, cause it to rise up in a central fold by pressing your hands\r\ntowards each other. Notice carefully what happens. First, you get a\r\nlow arch, or anticline, like that of the Weald. Then as you press it\r\nmore, the upward fold becomes sharper and narrower; then continue\r\npressing it, and you will find the fold bulging out at the top, but\r\nnarrowing in below until you get this fan-structure.\r\n\r\nThis is just what has happened in the case of the Alps. A tremendous\r\nlateral pressure applied to the rocks heaved them up and down\r\ninto great and small folds, and in some places, as in Mont Blanc,\r\nfan-structure was produced. Imagine the top of the fan removed, and\r\nyou get what looks like a syncline, but is really the lower part of a\r\nvery much compressed anticline.\r\n\r\nNow, it is believed that all mountain-ranges have been enormously\r\nsqueezed by lateral pressure; and the little experiment with the\r\nsheet of paper furnishes a good illustration of what has happened. A\r\ntable-cloth lying on a smooth table will serve equally well. You can\r\neasily push it into a series of folds; notice how they come nearer\r\nas you continue pushing. You see also that in this way you get long\r\nnarrow ridges with valleys between. These represent the original\r\nanticlines and synclines of mountain-ranges, which in course of time\r\nare carved out, as explained above, until the synclines become hills\r\nand the anticlines valleys.\r\n\r\nEvery mountain-chain must originally have had long ridges like these,\r\nwhich in some cases determined the original directions of the streams\r\nand valleys; and it is easy to see now why mountain-chains are long\r\nand narrow, why their strata have been so greatly folded, and why\r\nwe get in every mountain-chain long ranges of hills roughly parallel\r\nwith each other (see chapter vi., pages 177-178).\r\n\r\nThe reason why granite, gneiss, and crystalline schists are\r\nfrequently found in the central and highest peaks of mountain-ranges\r\nis that we have the oldest and lowest rocks exposed to the surface,\r\non account of the enormous amount of denudation that has taken place.\r\nThere may be great masses of granite underlying all mountain-chains;\r\nbut it is only exposed to view when a very great deal of overlying\r\nrock has been removed.\r\n\r\nIt was thought at one time that granite was the oldest of all rocks,\r\nand that mountain-chains had been upheaved by masses of granite\r\npushing them up from below; but we know now that both these ideas\r\nare mistaken. Some granites are certainly old geologically, but\r\nothers are of later date; and it is certain that granite was not the\r\nupheaving agent, but more likely it followed the overlying rocks as\r\nthey were heaved up by lateral pressure, because the upward bending\r\nof the rocks would tend to relieve the enormous pressure down below,\r\nand so the granite would rise up.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MONT BLANC. SNOWFIELDS, GLACIERS. AND STREAMS.]\r\n\r\nWe now pass on to a very different example, where mountains are the\r\nresult of huge fractures and displacements; namely, the numerous\r\nand nearly parallel ranges of the Great Basin, of Western Arizona,\r\nand Northern Mexico. The region between the Sierra Nevada and the\r\nWahsatch Mountains, extending from Idaho to Mexico, is composed\r\nof very gently folded rocks deeply buried in places by extensive\r\noutflows of lava.\r\n\r\nNow, in this case the earth-movements caused great cracks, or splits,\r\ndoubtless attended by fearful earthquakes. We find here a series of\r\nnearly parallel fractures, hundreds of miles long, and fifteen to\r\nthirty miles apart. These traverse the entire region, dividing the\r\nrocks into long narrow blocks. There is evidence to show that the\r\nwhole region was once much more elevated than it is now, and has\r\nsubsided thousands of feet. During the subsidence along these lines\r\nof fracture, or faults, the blocks were tilted sideways; and the\r\nuptilted blocks, carved by denudation, form the isolated ranges of\r\nthis very interesting region (see illustration, chap. viii., p. 273,\r\nFig. 1). The faults are indicated by arrows pointing downwards; and\r\nthe dotted lines indicate the erosion of the uptilted blocks.\r\n\r\nBut this must be regarded as a very exceptional case, for we do not\r\nknow of any other mountain-range formed quite in the same way. Why\r\nthe strata, although only slightly bent, should have snapped so\r\nviolently in this case, while in other mountain-ranges they have\r\nsuffered much more bending without so much fracture and displacement,\r\nwe cannot tell, but can only suggest that possibly it was because\r\nthey were not buried up under an enormous thickness of overlying\r\nrocks, which would exert an enormous downward pressure, and so tend\r\nto prevent fracturing.\r\n\r\nThere are many other deeply interesting questions with regard to the\r\nupheaval of mountains which at present cannot be answered.\r\n\r\nWe have already learned to alter our preconceived ideas about the\r\nstability and immovable nature of the earth's crust, and have seen\r\nthat it is in reality most unstable, and is undergoing continual\r\nmovements, both great and small. But here we have an equally\r\nstartling discovery, which quite upsets all our former ideas of the\r\nhard and unyielding nature of the rocks composing the earth's crust;\r\nfor we find that not only can they be bent into innumerable folds\r\nand little puckerings, but that in some cases they have been drawn\r\nout and squeezed as if they were so much soft putty. The imagination\r\nalmost fails to grasp such facts as these.\r\n\r\nOf late years geologists in Switzerland and in Great Britain have\r\ndiscovered that in some parts of mountains rocks have been enormously\r\ndistorted and crushed, so that they have assumed very different\r\nstates from those in which they were made, and curious mineral\r\nchanges have taken place under the influence of this crushing.\r\n\r\nIn the very complicated region of the Northwest Highlands of\r\nSutherland and Ross, the structure of which has only lately been\r\nexplained, some wonderful discoveries of this nature have been\r\nmade. Certain of the crystalline schists found there have been\r\nformed by the crushing down and rearrangement of older rocks that\r\nonce presented a very different appearance. In this district,\r\nwhere the rocks have been squeezed by enormous lateral pressure,\r\nthe dislocations sometimes have assumed the form of inclined or\r\nundulating planes, the rocks above which have been actually pushed\r\nover those below, and in some cases the horizontal displacement\r\namounts to many miles.\r\n\r\nNot only have the rocks been ruptured, and older, deep-seated masses\r\nbeen torn up and driven bodily over younger strata (that once were\r\n_above_ them), but there has been at the same time such an amount\r\nof internal shearing as to crush the rocks into a finely divided\r\nmaterial, and to give rise to a streaky arrangement of the broken\r\nparticles, closely resembling the flow-structure of a lava. In the\r\ncrushed material new minerals have been sometimes so developed as to\r\nproduce a true schist.[32]\r\n\r\n  [32] Geikie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE AGES OF MOUNTAINS, AND OTHER QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n    O Earth, what changes hast thou seen!\r\n\r\n    TENNYSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt might naturally be asked at what period in the world's primeval\r\nor geological history some particular mountain-range was upheaved;\r\nwhether it is younger or older than another one perhaps not very\r\nfar away; and again, whether the mountain-chains of the world have\r\nbeen uplifted all at once, or whether the process of elevation was\r\nprolonged and gradual?\r\n\r\nQuestions such as these are deeply interesting, and present to the\r\ngeologist some of the most fascinating problems to be met with in the\r\nwhole range of this science. And though at first sight they might\r\nseem hopelessly beyond our reach, yet even here the prospect is by no\r\nmeans unpromising; and it is quite possible to show that they can be\r\nanswered to some extent. Here we shall find our illustration of the\r\ncathedral (see chapter v., pages 143-147) holds good once more.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps hardly necessary to explain that by looking at a\r\nGothic cathedral one can say at what period or periods it was built.\r\nPerhaps it has a Norman nave, with great pillars and rounded arches.\r\nThen the chancel might be Early English, with pointed windows and\r\ndeep mouldings, and other features that serve to mark the style of\r\nthe building, and therefore its date,--because different styles\r\nprevailed at different periods. Other parts might contain work easily\r\nrecognised as belonging to the \"Perpendicular\" period.\r\n\r\nNow, as there have been periods in the history of architecture and\r\nart, so there have been periods in the history of our earth. What\r\nthese periods were, and how we have learned to recognise them, we\r\nmust first very briefly describe.[33]\r\n\r\n  [33] For a fuller account see the writer's \"Autobiography of the\r\n  Earth.\"\r\n\r\nThere are two simple rules by which the age of an ordinary\r\nsedimentary rock may be ascertained. This is fixed (1) By its\r\nposition with regard to others; (2) By the nature of its embedded\r\nanimal or vegetable remains, known as fossils.\r\n\r\nThese rules may easily be illustrated by a reference to the methods\r\nof the antiquary. For instance, suppose you were going to build\r\na house, and the foundations had just been dug out; you might on\r\nexamining them find several old layers of soil, showing that the site\r\nor neighbourhood had been formerly occupied. You might find in one\r\nlayer stone implements, in another Roman or early British pottery,\r\nand yet again portions of brick or stonework, together with tools\r\nor articles of domestic use, belonging, say, to the time of Queen\r\nElizabeth. Now, which of these layers would be the oldest? It is\r\nquite clear that the lowest layers must have been there the longest,\r\nbecause the others accumulated on the top of them.\r\n\r\nThe explorations made of late years under Jerusalem have led to the\r\ninteresting discovery that the modern city is built up on the remains\r\nof thirteen former cities of Jerusalem, all of which have been\r\ndestroyed in one way or another. Here, again, it is quite clear that\r\nthe oldest layer of débris must be that which lies at the bottom, and\r\nthe newest will be the one on the top.\r\n\r\nAgain, you know that the \"Stone Age\" in Britain came before the Roman\r\noccupation. Those old stone implements were made by a barbarous race,\r\nwho knew very little of agriculture or the arts of civilisation. Then\r\nin succeeding centuries various arts were introduced, many relics of\r\nwhich are found buried in the soil; and hence, since different styles\r\nof art and architecture prevailed at different periods, the works of\r\nart or industry embedded in any old layers of soil serve to fix the\r\ndate of those layers.\r\n\r\nThese layers of soil and débris correspond to the layers or strata of\r\nthe sedimentary rocks, in which the different chapters of the world's\r\nhistory are recorded. Geology is only another kind of history; and\r\nthe same principles which guide the archæologist searching buried\r\ncities also guide the geologist in reading the stony record. As the\r\nillustrious Hutton said, \"The ruins of an older world are visible\r\nin the present state of our planet.\" The successive layers of ruin\r\nin this case are to be seen in the great series of the stratified\r\nrocks; and we may lay it down as an axiom that the lowest strata are\r\nthe oldest, unless by some subsequent disturbance the order should\r\nhave been reversed, which, fortunately, is a rare occurrence, though\r\nexamples are to be found in some mountain-chains with violent\r\nfoldings.\r\n\r\nBut it often happens that neither the strata which should come\r\nabove nor those that lie below can be seen. Then our second rule\r\ncomes in: We can determine the age of the rock in question by its\r\nfossils. The reason of this has perhaps already been guessed by the\r\nreader. It is that as different kinds of plants and animals have\r\nprevailed at different periods of the world's history, so there have\r\nbeen \"styles,\" or fashions, in creation, as well as in art. At one\r\ngeological period certain curious types of fishes flourished which\r\nare now almost extinct, only a few old-fashioned survivals being\r\nfound in one or two out-of-the-way places. At another period certain\r\ntypes of reptiles flourished vigorously, and were the leaders in\r\ntheir day; but they have altogether vanished and become extinct. So\r\none type after another has appeared on the scene, played its humble\r\npart in the great drama of life; and then--\"exit!\" another takes its\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIn the oldest and lowest of the series of rocks we find no certain\r\ntrace of life at all. In the next series we find only lowly\r\ncreatures, such as shell-fish, corals, and crab-like animals that\r\nhave no backbone. In a higher group of rocks fishes appear for the\r\nfirst time. Later on, we come across the remains of amphibious\r\ncreatures for the first time. Then follows (after a long unrecorded\r\ninterval) an era when reptiles and birds existed in great numbers.\r\nAfter another long interval we come to strata containing many and\r\ndiverse remains of mammals or quadrupeds. So we have an \"Age of\r\nFishes,\" an \"Age of Reptiles,\" and an \"Age of Mammals.\" Some tribes\r\nof these creatures died out, but others lived on to the present day.\r\nThus we see that there has been a continuous progress in life as the\r\nworld grew older, for higher types kept coming in.\r\n\r\nTo the geologist fossils are of the greatest possible use, since they\r\nhelp him to determine the age of a particular set of strata, for\r\ncertain kinds of fossils belong to certain rocks, and to them only.\r\n\r\nBut the classification of the stratified rocks has been carried\r\nfarther than this. Practical geologists, working in the field, use\r\nfossils as their chief guide in working out the subdivisions of a\r\ngroup of rocks, for certain genera and species of old plants and\r\nanimals are found to belong to certain small groups of strata. In\r\nthis way a definite order of succession has been established once\r\nfor all; and, except in the case of inverted strata already alluded\r\nto, this order is invariably found to hold good.\r\n\r\nThis great discovery of the order of succession of the British\r\nstratified rocks, established by their fossil contents, is due to\r\nWilliam Smith, the father of English geology. After exploring the\r\nwhole of England, he published in 1815 a geological map, the result\r\nof his extraordinary labours. Before then people had no idea of a\r\ndefinite and regular succession of rocks extending over the country,\r\ncapable of being recognised to some extent by the nature of the\r\nrocks themselves,--whether sandstones, clays, or limestones, etc.,\r\nbut chiefly by their own fossils. They thought the different kinds\r\nof rocks were scattered promiscuously up and down the face of the\r\ncountry; but _now_ we know that they do not show themselves in this\r\nhaphazard way, but have definite relations to each other, like the\r\nmany volumes of one large book.\r\n\r\nBy combining the two principles referred to above, geologists have\r\narranged the great series of British stratified rocks into certain\r\ngroups, each indicating a long period of time. First, they are\r\nroughly divided into three large groups, marking the three great eras\r\ninto which geological time is divided. Secondly, these eras are\r\nfurther divided into certain periods. These periods are again divided\r\ninto epochs, indicated by local divisions of their rocks. In this way\r\nwe have something like a historical table. Omitting the small epochs\r\nof time, this table is as follows, in descending order:--\r\n\r\n_Table of the British Stratified Rocks._\r\n\r\n       ERA.         PERIOD.

These\r\nnames have been given partly from the region in which the rocks\r\noccur, partly from the nature of the rocks themselves, and partly\r\nfor other reasons. Thus the Old Red Sandstone is so called, because\r\nit generally, though not always, appears as a dark red sandstone.\r\nBut the Silurian rocks, which we find in North Wales, receive\r\ntheir name from the Silures, an ancient Welsh tribe; the Cambrian\r\nrocks take theirs from Cambria, the old name for North Wales. The\r\nCretaceous rocks are partly composed of chalk, for which the Latin\r\nword is _creta_; and so on. The terms \"Palæozoic,\" \"Mesozoic,\" and\r\n\"Cainozoic\" mean \"ancient life,\" \"middle life,\" and \"recent or new\r\nlife,\" thus indicating that as time went on the various types of\r\nlife that flourished on the earth became less old-fashioned, and\r\nmore like those prevailing at the present time. These used to be\r\ncalled \"Primary,\" \"Secondary,\" and \"Tertiary;\" but the terms were\r\nunfortunate, because the primary rocks, as then known, were not the\r\nfirst, or oldest. We have therefore included the Archæan rocks,\r\nsince discovered, in this primary group. Only one fossil has been\r\nfound in these rocks, and that is a doubtful one; hence they are\r\nsometimes called \"Azoic,\" that is, \"without life.\" The Mesozoic rocks\r\nare, as it were, the records of the \"middle ages\" in the world's\r\nhistory; while the Palæozoic take us back to a truly primeval time.\r\n\r\nWe have now learned how the geological age of any group of rocks\r\nmay be determined. Thus, if a series of rocks of unknown age can be\r\nshown to rest on undoubtedly Silurian rocks in one place, and in\r\nanother place to be overlaid or covered by undoubtedly Carboniferous\r\nrocks, they will probably belong to the Old Red Sandstone Period. If\r\nafterwards we find that they contain some of the well-known fossils\r\nof that period, the question of their age is settled at once. But we\r\nwant more evidence than this. Suppose, now, we find somewhere on the\r\nflanks of a mountain-range a series of Permian and Triassic rocks,\r\nresting almost horizontally on disturbed and folded Carboniferous\r\nstrata. Does not that at once prove that the upheaval took place\r\nbefore the Permian Period? Clearly it does, because the Permian rocks\r\nhave evidently _not_ been disturbed thereby. So now we can fix the\r\ndate of our range of hills; namely, after the Carboniferous Period\r\nand before the Permian Period.\r\n\r\nIt is by such reasoning that the age of our Pennine range of hills,\r\nextending from the north of England into Derbyshire, has been fixed;\r\nfor the Permian and Triassic strata lie undisturbed on the upheaved\r\narch of Carboniferous rocks of which this chain is composed. Its\r\nstructure is that of a broken and much denuded anticline, which\r\nstands up to form a line of hills only because the Carboniferous\r\nlimestone is so much harder than the \"coal measures,\" or coal-bearing\r\nrocks, on each side of it, that it has not been worn away so fast. In\r\ntime, this great anticline will be entirely worn away like that of\r\nthe Weald. It is called the Great Mountain Limestone, because it so\r\noften rises up to form high ground. The Mendip Hills in Somersetshire\r\nare of about the same date, and they too are largely composed of this\r\ngreat limestone formation.\r\n\r\nOf course, a certain amount of up and down movement took place after\r\nthe hills were upheaved, otherwise the Permian and Triassic rocks\r\ncould not have been deposited on their sides; but these movements\r\nwere slight and of a more general kind than those by which strata are\r\nthrown into folds.\r\n\r\nThe main upheaval, by which the rocks now forming the Highlands of\r\nScotland were lifted up and contorted, took place after the Lower\r\nSilurian Period, and before that of the Old Red Sandstone; and there\r\nis clear evidence that even before the latter period they had not\r\nonly been greatly altered, or \"metamorphosed,\" by subterranean heat,\r\nbut that they had suffered enormous denudation. And the work of\r\ncarving out these mountains has gone on ever since; for even in Old\r\nRed Sandstone times they were probably not entirely covered by water.\r\nThe Highland Mountains are therefore older than the Pennine range.\r\n\r\nGeologically Scotland belongs in great part to Scandinavia; and\r\nthe long line of Scandinavian Mountains is a continuation of the\r\nHighlands, and so is of the same age.\r\n\r\nMountain-chains and hill-ranges have been upheaved at various\r\ngeological periods; and some are very old, while others are much\r\nyounger.\r\n\r\nTurning to the southeast of England, we find the ranges of chalk\r\nhills forming the North and South Downs (see page 237). As explained\r\npreviously, these owe their existence to the upheaval and subsequent\r\ndenudation of the low arch, or anticline, of the Weald. They are\r\ncalled \"escarpments,\" because they are like lines of cliffs that are\r\nbeing gradually cut back. Now, it is clear that these hills are much\r\nnewer than either of those we have just considered. Look at the table\r\non page 324, and you will see that the Cretaceous rocks (chalk, etc.)\r\nbelong to the Mesozoic era. The chalk was the last rock formed during\r\nthe Cretaceous Period.\r\n\r\nSo the Wealden arch must have been heaved up after the chalk was\r\nformed; that is, ages and ages later than the date of the Pennine\r\nrange or the Scotch Highlands. From other evidences it has been shown\r\nthat this anticline was heaved up in the early part of the Cainozoic\r\nEra, perhaps during the Miocene Period.\r\n\r\nLet us now take the case of the Alps. And here we have an instructive\r\nexample of a great mountain system formed by repeated movements\r\nduring a long succession of geological periods. We cannot say\r\nthat they were entirely raised up at any one time in the world's\r\npast history. In the centre of this great range we find a series\r\nof igneous and metamorphic rocks, such as granite, gneiss, and\r\ncrystalline schists. Some of these may belong to the very oldest\r\nperiod,--namely, the Archæan; others are probably Palæozoic and\r\nCainozoic deposits greatly altered by heat and pressure.\r\n\r\nThe ground from Savoy to Austria began to be an area of disturbance\r\nand upheaval towards the close of the Palæozoic Era, if not before;\r\nso that crystalline schists and Carboniferous strata were raised\r\nup to form elevated land around which Permian conglomerates and\r\nshingle-beds were formed,--as on the seashore at the present day.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the Mesozoic Era local fractures and certain\r\nup and down movements occurred. After this there was a long period\r\nof subsidence, during which a series of strata known as Oölites and\r\nCretaceous were deposited on the floor of an old sea.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of this long era, a fresh upheaval took place along\r\nthe present line of the Alps,--an upheaval that was prolonged into\r\nthe Eocene Period. It was during this latter period that a very\r\nextensive formation known as the \"Nummulitic limestone\" was formed in\r\na sea that covered a large part of Europe and Asia. We have already\r\nreferred (see chap. v., pp. 169-171) to the way in which limestones\r\nhave been formed. Nummulites are little shells that were formed by\r\ntiny shell-fish.\r\n\r\nBut after this, the greatest upheaval and disturbance took place,--an\r\nupheaval to which the Alps as we now see them are chiefly due. By\r\nthis means the older Cainozoic strata, once lying horizontally on the\r\nfloor of the sea, were raised up, together with older rocks, to form\r\ndry land, and not only raised up, but crumpled, dislocated, and in\r\nsome cases turned upside down.\r\n\r\nSo intense was the compression to which the Eocene rocks were\r\nsubjected that they were converted into a hard and even crystalline\r\nstate. It seems almost incredible that these highly altered rocks\r\nwhich look so ancient are of the same date as our London clay and\r\nthe soft Eocene deposits of the south of England; but in our country\r\nthe movement that raised up those strata was of the most feeble and\r\ngentle kind compared to the violent disturbances that took place in\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\nAnd here we may point out that the Alps are only a portion of a\r\nvast chain of mountains stretching right across Europe and Asia in\r\na general east and west direction, beginning with the Pyrenees and\r\npassing through the Alps, the Carpathians, the Caucasus, and the\r\nrange of Elbruz to the Hindoo-Koosh and the high plateau of Pamir,\r\ncalled \"the roof of the world,\" which stands like a huge fortress,\r\nfifteen thousand feet high. Thence it passes to the still higher\r\ntracts of Thibet, great plains exceeding in height the highest\r\nsummits of the Alps, being enclosed between the lofty ramparts of\r\nthe Himalayas on the south and the Kuen-Lun Mountains on the north;\r\nand thence the mountain wall is prolonged in the Yuen-Ling, In-Shan,\r\nKhin-Gan, and other ranges till it finally passes to the Pacific\r\nOcean at Behring's Strait.\r\n\r\nAll these ranges are, as it were, the backbone of the great\r\ncontinental plateau of the Old World, and doubtless are chiefly due\r\nto those earth-movements by means of which the Alps were upheaved.\r\nThe last grand movement, which raised the Mont Blanc range, was\r\nprobably rather later, and seems to have taken place as late as the\r\nPliocene Period.\r\n\r\nAt the present day no great movements are taking place in the Alps;\r\nbut now and then earthquakes visit this region, and serve to remind\r\nus that the process of mountain-making is still slowly going on.\r\n\r\nProbably there have been times in the history of all these\r\nmountain-ranges when movements took place of a more violent and\r\nconvulsive kind than anything with which we are familiar at the\r\npresent day; and the age we live in may be one of comparative\r\nrepose. This is of course somewhat a matter of speculation; and we\r\nonly allude to it because there has been a tendency on the part of\r\nsome to carry the theory of uniformity in all geological operations\r\nmuch farther than Hutton or Lyell ever intended. But at the same\r\ntime there is no need to go back to the old teaching of sudden\r\ncatastrophes and violent revolutions. We only wish to avoid either of\r\nthese two extremes and to take a safe middle course.\r\n\r\nHow rapidly some of these great earth-movements took place it is\r\nimpossible at present to say; but in several cases it can be shown\r\nthat they were quite slow, as indicated by the testimony of the\r\nrivers. Thus, the rise of the great Uintah Mountains of the Western\r\nStates was so slow and gradual that the Green River, which flowed\r\nacross the site of the range, so far from being turned aside as they\r\nrose up, has actually been able to deepen its cañon as fast as the\r\nmountains were upheaved. So that the two processes, as it were, kept\r\npace with each other, and the river went on cutting out its gorges\r\nat the same time that the ground over which it flowed was gently\r\nupheaved; and as the land rose the river flowed faster, and therefore\r\nacquired more power to cut and deepen its channel. This is a valuable\r\npiece of evidence; but in this case we have only a few big broad\r\nfolds, instead of the violent folding seen in the Alps. However,\r\ncertain Pliocene strata lying on the southern flanks of the Himalayas\r\nshow that the rivers still run in the same lines as they occupied\r\nbefore the last great upheaval took place.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the substance of the mountains was slowly\r\nmanufactured by means of such quiet and gentle operations as may\r\nbe witnessed at the present day; how the rivers of old brought\r\ndown their burdens as they do now, and flung them into the sea; how\r\nthe sea spread them out very slowly and compacted them into level\r\nlayers, to form, in process of time, the hard rocky framework of\r\nthe plateaux, hills, and mountains of the world; how vast marine\r\naccumulations were also slowly manufactured through the agency of\r\ncountless generations of humble organisms, subtracting carbonate of\r\nlime from sea water to form the limestones of future ages; how by\r\nslow earth-movements these marine deposits were reared up into dry\r\nland; how they have frequently been penetrated by molten rocky matter\r\nfrom below, which occasionally forced its way up to the surface\r\nand gave rise to various volcanic eruptions, by means of which the\r\nsedimentary rocks were often considerably baked and hardened, and new\r\nfissures filled up with valuable metallic ores and precious stones;\r\nhow lava-flows and great deposits of volcanic ash were mingled with\r\nthese sedimentary rocks.\r\n\r\nThen we endeavoured to follow the history of these rocky layers after\r\ntheir upheaval, and learn how they are affected by the ceaseless\r\noperations of rain and rivers and other agents of destruction, so\r\nthat finally the upheaved ridges of the lands are carved out into all\r\nthose wonderful features of crag and pinnacle and precipice that give\r\nthe mountains their present shapes and outlines. All this we were\r\nable to account for, without the aid of any imaginary or unnatural\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nAnd, lastly, we have seen that even where such causes might seem\r\nat first almost indispensable,--when mountains tell us of mighty\r\ninternal forces crumpling, folding, and fracturing their rocky\r\nframework,--yet even there we can account for what we see without\r\nsupposing them to have been torn and tossed about by any very violent\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MOUNTAIN IN THE YOSEMITE VALLEY.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the question of the cause, or causes, of earth-movements,\r\nwhereby continents are upheaved, and the contorting, folding, and\r\ncrumpling of the rocks of mountains produced, is not at present\r\nthoroughly explained, it may perhaps be worth our while to consider\r\nbriefly some of the views that have been put forward on this\r\ndifficult subject. The words \"upheaval\" and \"elevation,\" in reference\r\nto movements of the earth's surface, are somewhat misleading, but are\r\nused for want of better terms. They would seem to imply that the\r\nforce which produced mountains was a kind of upward push; whereas, in\r\nmost cases, and perhaps in all, the force, whatever it was, did not\r\nact in an upward direction. So it should be understood that we employ\r\nthese terms only to indicate that the rocks have somehow been carried\r\nup to a higher level, and not as suggesting _how_ the force acted by\r\nwhich they were raised.\r\n\r\nIt seems pretty clear that in the case of mountain-chains, at least,\r\nthe force acted in a horizontal direction, as a kind of side-thrust.\r\n\r\nThis we endeavoured to illustrate in chapter ix. by means of a simple\r\nexperiment with a sheet of paper; and it was shown how folds similar\r\nto those of which Mont Blanc is composed could be imitated by simply\r\npressing the sides of a sheet of paper inwards with one's two hands\r\nas it lies on a table. Such lateral pressure, it is thought by many,\r\nmust be caused by the shrinking of the lower and hotter parts of the\r\nearth's crust as they cool, leaving the outer crust unsupported, so\r\nthat it gradually settles down onto a smaller surface below, and in\r\nso doing must inevitably be wrinkled and throw itself into a series\r\nof folds (see chapter vi., page 204).\r\n\r\nThe interior of the earth is hotter than the outside; and since there\r\nis good reason to think that the whole earth was once upon a time in\r\na highly heated and perhaps half molten condition, we are compelled\r\nto believe that it always has been, and still is, a cooling globe.\r\nNow, almost all known substances are found to contract more or less\r\non cooling; and so if the materials of which the earth is mainly\r\ncomposed are at all similar in their nature and properties to those\r\nwhich we find on its surface, it follows that the earth must be\r\ncontracting at the same time that it is cooling, just as a red-hot\r\npoker will contract on being taken out of the fire.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we find that hot bodies contract faster than those that are\r\nmerely warm, so that a red-hot poker contracts more during the first\r\nfew minutes after it is taken out of the fire than it does after\r\nit has passed the red-hot stage. Hence it is easy to see that the\r\ninterior portions of the earth, which are hotter, must be contracting\r\nat a greater rate than its external parts, for they evidently have\r\nvery little heat to lose. This may seem rather puzzling to the reader\r\nat first; for it might be argued that the heat from below _must_ pass\r\nthrough the external layers, or crust, as it is often called. But it\r\nshould be remembered that this is not the only way in which the earth\r\nloses heat. Think of the vast amount of heat given out from the earth\r\nevery year by volcanic eruptions, and you will see at once that much\r\nof the cooling takes place in this way, and not as a direct flow of\r\nheat from the interior, as in the case of the poker. A single big\r\nlava-stream flowing out from a volcano, and cooling on the surface\r\nof the earth, represents so much heat lost forever; and so do the\r\nclouds of steam emitted during every eruption; so, again, do even the\r\nhot springs that are continually bringing up warm water. If, then,\r\nthe lower portions of the earth are slowly contracting, they must\r\ntend to leave the outer portions of the crust unsupported, so that\r\nthey would be compelled by their own enormous weight to settle down.\r\nNow, we know that something like this happens in coal mines; and as\r\nlong passages are hollowed out below, the ground begins to \"creep,\"\r\nor slowly sink. Think what would be the effect of a slow sinking of\r\nany portion of the earth down towards the centre; it would inevitably\r\nbe curved up and down into numerous folds, as it endeavoured to get\r\nitself onto a smaller space, much in the same way that a table-cloth,\r\nwhen thrown onto a table in a kind of arch, settles down in a series\r\nof waves, or folds. And this, it is thought, is the way in which\r\nit happens that the pressure comes, as we said just now, sideways,\r\ninstead of from below upwards. It is on this theory that many\r\ngeologists account for the enormous side-pressure to which rocks have\r\nin many cases been subjected.\r\n\r\nThe evidences of such pressure are many. In some cases fossils\r\nhave been thereby pulled out of shape and appear considerably\r\ndistorted; in others, even hard quartz pebbles have been considerably\r\nelongated (see chap. ix., pp. 315-316). Then again, we have the\r\nlittle crumplings of all sizes so frequently seen in mica-schists.\r\nAnd lastly, the peculiar property that slates possess of splitting\r\nup into thin sheets is found to be due to the same cause; namely,\r\nlateral pressure. Slates were originally formed of soft dark mud, and\r\non being subsequently squeezed, by earth-movements, have assumed\r\na structure known as \"cleavage,\" whereby their tiny mud-particles\r\nwere elongated, and all assumed the same direction, thus giving to\r\nthe rock this peculiar property of splitting. It can be proved that\r\nthe pressure came in a direction opposite to that of the planes\r\nof cleavage; and it is found that the direction of the cleavage\r\ncorresponds in a general way with the direction, or trend, of a\r\nmountain-chain which is composed partly of slates, as in North Wales.\r\nAnd this discovery helps and harmonises with what we have already\r\nsaid about the cause of the folds in mountain-chains, for the same\r\nforce, acting sideways, produced the cleavage and the folding, etc.\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated that in a large number of cases a\r\nmountain-range has a central axis, or band, of granite or other\r\ncrystalline rock. This led some people to suppose that the granite\r\nhad been driven up from below, and in so doing had thrust up the\r\noverlying rocks seen on either flank of the chain; in other words,\r\nthey believed granite to have been the upheaving agent. And even now\r\nwe often find unscientific writers speaking of the volcanic forces of\r\nupheaval.\r\n\r\nHaving very little idea of the true structure of mountains, they\r\nbelieved them to consist of a kind of core, or axis, of this igneous\r\nrock, with sedimentary rocks sloping away from it on each side.\r\nThis was a very simple theory of mountain-chains, but unfortunately\r\nit will not bear examination. It takes no notice of the folding\r\nwhich is so characteristic of mountain strata, and is quite out of\r\nagreement with the facts of the case; so it must be buried among the\r\narchives of the past. Mountain-chains are now known to have a much\r\nmore complicated structure than this,--thanks to the labours of many\r\nsubsequent observers.\r\n\r\nThat illustrious astronomer, the late Sir John Herschel, threw out\r\na bold suggestion on this subject, which in the light of recent\r\ndiscoveries with regard to the delicate adjustment between the\r\ninternal and external forces affecting the earth's surface, is\r\nworthy of careful consideration. His idea was that the mere weight\r\nof a thick mass of sediment resting on any portion of the earth's\r\ncrust might cause a certain amount of sinking; and that this would\r\ncause portions on either side to swell up. It is certain that as\r\ngreat deposits of sedimentary materials accumulate on the floor of\r\nan ocean, that floor slowly sinks, otherwise the sea would become\r\nchoked up, and dry land would take its place. Now, it is found that\r\nevery great mountain-chain consists of many thousands of feet of\r\nstrata thus formed; and more than this: it turns out that a greater\r\nthickness of such materials has been formed in regions where we\r\nnow see mountain-chains than in those continental regions that lie\r\nfarther away from them. This is an important fact, which was not\r\nknown in Sir John Herschel's time. One striking example may be\r\nmentioned here. In the complicated region of the Appalachian chain\r\nthe strata are estimated to have a total thickness of eight miles;\r\nwhile in Indiana, where the same strata are nearly horizontal, they\r\nare less than one mile thick. Hence it is not impossible that in the\r\nmere accumulation, through long periods of time, of vast masses of\r\nstrata many thousands of feet thick, we may find a potent cause of\r\nearth-movements.\r\n\r\nThe marginal regions of oceans, where most deposition takes place,\r\nseem to undergo slow subsidence, while the continents seem in most\r\nplaces to be as slowly rising. Modern geologists are inclined to\r\nthink that as denudation wears down a continental surface, removing\r\nfrom it a great quantity of solid rocky matter (see chap. v., pp.\r\n161-163), the pressure below is somewhat lessened, or in other words,\r\nso much weight is taken off; but that, on the other hand, as this\r\nextra amount of material accumulates on the bed of a neighbouring\r\nocean the pressure is increased by a corresponding amount, and so the\r\nbalance between internal and external forces is upset, and movements\r\nconsequently take place. We have already seen that the external parts\r\nof the earth are much more subject to movements than might have been\r\nexpected; and for our part, we are willing to believe that in this\r\nsimple way upheaving forces might be called into play sufficient to\r\naccount for even the elevation of mountain-chains. For suppose a\r\ngreat mass of strata to continue sinking as they were formed, for\r\nlong periods of time; what seems to follow? The downward movement\r\nwould go on until a time would come when the strata, in endeavouring\r\nto settle down at a lower level, would (as by the contraction\r\ntheory above explained) be forced to fold themselves into ridges,\r\nand in this way long strips of them might even be elevated into\r\nmountain-ranges.\r\n\r\nAnother ingenious idea was suggested by the late Mr. Scrope, whose\r\nwork on volcanoes is well known. His idea was that when a large\r\namount of sedimentary material has accumulated on any large area\r\nof the bed of the ocean, it somewhat checks the flow of heat from\r\nwithin, and therefore the temperature of the rocks forming part of\r\nthe earth's crust below will be increased, much in the same manner as\r\na glove checks the escape of heat from the hand and keeps it warm.\r\nThe consequence of this would be expansion; and as such expansion\r\nwould be chiefly in a horizontal direction, the area would bulge\r\nupwards and cause elevation of the strata resting on it. But there\r\nare several difficulties which this theory fails to explain.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, Professor Le Conte, holding that the contraction theory\r\nis unsatisfactory, accounts for earth-movements of all kinds by\r\nsupposing that some internal parts of the earth cool and contract\r\nfaster than others. Those parts that cool fastest, according to this\r\ntheory, are those that underlie the oceanic basins or troughs; while\r\nthe continental areas, not cooling so rapidly, are left standing up\r\nin relief. This theory, which does not seem very satisfactory, is\r\nbased upon the idea that some parts of the earth's interior may be\r\ncapable of conducting heat faster than others. We know that some\r\nsubstances, like iron, are good conductors of heat, while others are\r\nbad conductors; and it is therefore conceivable that heat may be\r\nflowing faster along some parts of the earth than along others; and\r\nif so, there would be differences in the rate of contraction.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are various theories with regard to the nature of the earth's\r\ninterior. One of these already referred to, but now antiquated,\r\nsupposes our planet to consist of a thin, solid crust lying on a\r\nmolten interior, so that the world would be something like an egg\r\nwith its thin shell and liquid, or semi-liquid, interior. Now, there\r\nare grave reasons for refusing to accept this idea. In the first\r\nplace, a certain slow movement of the earth known as \"precession,\"\r\nbecause it causes the precession of the equinoctial points on the\r\nearth's orbit, could not possibly take place as it does if the\r\nearth's interior were in this loose and molten condition. That is\r\na matter decided by mathematical calculation, on which we will not\r\ndwell further. Secondly, we obtain some very valuable evidence on\r\nthis abstruse subject from the well-known daily phenomenon of the\r\ntides, caused, as the reader is probably aware, by the attractions of\r\nthe sun and moon; but much more by the moon, because she is nearer,\r\nand so exerts a greater pull on the ocean as each part of the world\r\nis brought directly under her by the earth's daily rotation on its\r\naxis. The waters of our oceans rise up twice each day as they get\r\nin a line with the moon, and then begin to fall again. Thus we get\r\nthat daily ebb and flow seen on our shores. Now, it has been clearly\r\nproved by Sir William Thomson, and others, that if any considerable\r\nportion of the interior of the earth were in a fluid condition, it\r\ntoo would rise and fall every day as the ocean does. So we should in\r\nthat case have a tide _below_ the earth as well as on its surface,\r\nand the one would tend to neutralise the other, and the ocean tide\r\nought to appear less than it actually is. Even if the earth's crust\r\nwere made of solid steel, and several hundreds of miles thick, it\r\nwould yield so much to the enormous pulls exerted by both the sun\r\nand moon that it would simply carry the waters of the ocean up and\r\ndown with it, and we should therefore see no appreciable rise and\r\nfall of the water relatively to the land. As a matter of fact, there\r\n_is_ a very slight tide in the solid earth below our feet, but so\r\nslight that it does not practically affect the tide which we see\r\nevery day in the ocean. But we wish to show that were the interior of\r\nthe earth in anything approaching, to a fluid or molten condition,\r\nthe phenomena of the tides would be very different from what they\r\nactually are.\r\n\r\nAll geologists are therefore agreed that we must consider our earth\r\nas a more or less solid body, and not as being something like an\r\nindia-rubber ball filled with water.\r\n\r\nThe only question is whether it is entirely solid throughout. Some\r\nauthorities consider this to be the case. But others venture to think\r\nthat while the great mass of the globe is solid, there may be a thin\r\nliquid layer lying somewhere below the surface. Sir William Thomson\r\ncalculates that there must be a solid crust at least two thousand or\r\ntwenty-five hundred miles thick (the diameter of the earth is about\r\neight thousand miles) and that the mass of the earth \"is on the whole\r\nmore rigid certainly than a continuous solid globe of glass of the\r\nsame diameter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOne other question with regard to the earth's interior may be\r\nmentioned in conclusion. Astronomers have calculated the weight of\r\nour planet, and the result is curious; for it turns out to be _at\r\nleast twice as heavy as the heaviest rocks that are found on or near\r\nthe surface_. It is about five and a half times as heavy as a globe\r\nof water of the same size would be, whereas most rocks with which\r\nwe are acquainted are about two and a half, or at most three times\r\nheavier than water. This fact seems to open out curious consequences;\r\nfor instance, it is quite possible that metals (which are of course\r\nmuch heavier than water) may exist in the earth's interior in\r\nconsiderable quantities. The imagination at once conjures up vast\r\nquantities of gold and silver. What is the source of the gold and\r\nsilver, and other metals found in mineral veins? This question cannot\r\nas yet be fully answered. Very small quantities of various metals\r\nhave been detected in sea-water; and so some geologists look upon the\r\nsea as the source from which metals came. But it is possible that\r\nthey were introduced from below,--perhaps by the action of steam and\r\nhighly heated water during periods of volcanic activity,--and that\r\ntheir source is far down below in the depths of the earth.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps we have already wandered too far into the regions of\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the interesting problems suggested by the study of\r\nmountains, and they add no small charm to the science of geology.\r\n\r\nAnd as we leave the mountains behind us, refreshed by their bracing\r\nair, and strengthened for another season of toil and labour by\r\na brief sojourn among their peaks and passes, we come away with\r\na renewed sense of the almost unlimited power of the unhasting\r\noperations of Nature, and the wisdom and beneficence of the Great\r\nArchitect of the Universe, who made and planned those snowcapped\r\ntemples as symbols of His strength, who was working millions of years\r\nago as He is working to-day, and to whom a thousand years are as one\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Agents of transportation, 161.\r\n\r\n    Ages of strata, how determined, 317-333.\r\n\r\n    Air, composition of, 209.\r\n\r\n    Alpine animals, 124. plants, 103, 114.\r\n\r\n    Alps, the history of, 330.\r\n      (See also Ruskin.)\r\n\r\n    Ancients, the, their dread of the mountains, 3.\r\n\r\n    Andes, the, elevation of, 189.\r\n\r\n    Animals, behaviour of, before an avalanche or earthquake, 95.\r\n\r\n    \"Anticline,\" 237, 303, 327.\r\n\r\n    Appalachian Mountains, denudation of the, 239, 305-309.\r\n\r\n    Aqueous rocks, 154.\r\n\r\n    Archæan Era, 324.\r\n\r\n    Arctic flora, 121.\r\n\r\n    \"Arthur's Seat,\" 277.\r\n\r\n    Ashes, volcanic, 245, 251, 260.\r\n\r\n    Atlantic ooze, 172.\r\n\r\n    Atmosphere, effects produced by the, 209.\r\n      rarefaction of, 79.\r\n\r\n    Avalanches, 89.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Badger, the, in Alps, 128.\r\n\r\n    Baltic Sea, changes in, 182.\r\n\r\n    Barrier reef, of Australia, 170.\r\n\r\n    Basalt, of Hebrides, 278.\r\n      of Snowdon, 272.\r\n\r\n    Basin, the Great, of United States, 313.\r\n\r\n    Bear, brown, 125.\r\n      black, 126.\r\n\r\n    Beaver, the, in Alps, 128.\r\n\r\n    Bergfalls, 97.\r\n\r\n    Bernina, the, fall of rocks from, 98.\r\n\r\n    Bird, Miss (Mrs. Bishop), on eruption of Kilauea, 262.\r\n\r\n    Birds, of Alps, 134.\r\n\r\n    Blueness of the sky, 75.\r\n\r\n    Bombs, volcanic, 253.\r\n\r\n    Bonney, Prof., on mountain legends, 23.\r\n      on effects of the Alps in Europe, 48.\r\n      on wind on mountain-tops, 84.\r\n      on Alpine plants, 115.\r\n      on forms of mountains, 294.\r\n\r\n    Boulders, erratic, 225.\r\n\r\n    Bouquetin, the, in Alps, 133.\r\n\r\n    Britain, Great, rainfall of, 42.\r\n\r\n    Building up of mountains, 174.\r\n\r\n    Butterflies, in Alps, 138.\r\n\r\n    Buzzard, the, in Alps, 136.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cader Idris, volcano rocks of, 272.\r\n\r\n    Cainozoic Era, 324.\r\n\r\n    Callao, 189.\r\n\r\n    Cambrian rocks, 296, 324.\r\n\r\n    Canisp Mountain, 297.\r\n\r\n    Cañons of Colorado, 221.\r\n\r\n    Carbonic acid in atmosphere, 210.\r\n\r\n    Carboniferous Period, 324.\r\n\r\n    Catastrophes, 215.\r\n\r\n    Caves, human remains, etc., in, 31.\r\n\r\n    Celsius, on elevation of Gulf of Bothnia, 178.\r\n\r\n    Chalk, Cretaceous rocks composed of, 325.\r\n      origin of.
