LIPPINCOTT & CO.,\r\n     In the Clerk’s Office of the District Court of the United States\r\n                for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe translator of Ritter’s “Geographical Studies,” which has received\r\nin its English dress the hearty greeting of our most cultured scholars,\r\ntakes a renewed pleasure in giving to the students of our higher\r\nSeminaries a second volume from the pen of the great Geographer. The\r\nformer work, addressed, as its contents mainly were, to the members\r\nof the Royal Academy of Berlin, was too recondite in thought and too\r\nabstruse and elaborate in statement ever to become, whether in German or\r\nin English, a popular work; but the present volume—the bright, compact\r\ncrystal of Ritter’s life—will pass into a general circulation, and will\r\nbe recognized as not merely a simple and perfectly intelligible treatise,\r\nbut as a masterly application of the comparative method of Geography, and\r\nas philosophical as it is practical and interesting.\r\n\r\nBesides the voluminous Erdkunda, which deals almost exclusively with\r\nAsia, and treats it with an exhaustive fullness, Ritter has left the\r\nworld the volume already referred to, and three courses of Academical\r\nLectures. One of these courses is now before the reader; one of the\r\nremaining two relates to the geography of Europe, and the other to the\r\nhistory of Geographical Science and of Discovery. Of these three courses,\r\na distinguished American scholar[1] has said: “Free from excessive\r\ndetails, systematic, clear, bold, and fresh, they are better fitted to\r\nbring up to the mind Ritter, the university instructor, than all his\r\nother writings.” This praise is by no means excessive; and the student\r\nwho shall, with the assistance of a good physical atlas, go through\r\nthis work, will find himself master of a far larger number of special\r\nfacts than the size of the volume would indicate; and also of a _science_\r\nof Geography, which subsidizes all detail, and makes it auxiliary to\r\nthe comprehension of relations no less beautiful and singular than are\r\nrevealed in the study of the other departments of Nature.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar difficulties attending the translation of the Geographical\r\nStudies have not been met in this volume; in the University lecture-room,\r\nRitter’s style, which, before the Royal Academy, was extremely involved,\r\npoetical and inexhaustive, became simple, straightforward, and luminous.\r\nIn style, Ritter carried neglect to the point of slovenliness; and the\r\nfinish which Humboldt cultivated so assiduously, he rejected as unworthy\r\nof a true scholar. The highly figurative words with which he used so\r\nliberally to decorate his writings, I have generally had to render with a\r\nrather too bare fidelity to a prose style; for grateful and captivating\r\nas they were to his German hearers, they would look over-fanciful to\r\nan English reader, and obscure rather than illustrate the thought.\r\nIt has been my earnest purpose to make this work fill a great void\r\nin our educational literature; and its convenient size gives it an\r\nincomparable advantage over the voluminous works of Sir John Herschel\r\nand Mrs. Somerville; while in rigid philosophical precision, in method,\r\nin natural growth—not to use that inevitable German word _development_,\r\n(Entwickelung)—even those eminent geographers would, doubtless, award it\r\nthe palm.\r\n\r\nThe demands of the public may yet render needful the translation of other\r\nof Ritter’s works; meanwhile, the editor of this work purposes to prepare\r\na biography of that great man, whose memory all his pupils revere, and\r\nwhose life was not less beautiful to his friends than it was fruitful and\r\nvaluable to the whole scientific world.\r\n\r\n                                                                  W.

Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of these lectures is Geography in its most enlarged and\r\ncomprehensive sense. It will be necessary to preface them with some\r\ngeneral observations, which shall serve to indicate the scientific basis\r\non which the discussion will rest. Our starting-point will be with Nature\r\nherself and not with arbitrary geographical systems hitherto constructed.\r\n\r\nBy the word Nature will be meant the entire Creation. The grasping of\r\nNature in all its objects and all its forces becomes, in conjunction\r\nwith the agency of Time and Space, the comprehension of a great system.\r\nThe inanimate creation may be represented under the term inorganic, the\r\nanimate creation under the term organic. Yet there is not an absolute\r\ncontrast between them; for in both there is ceaseless progress, no pause,\r\nbut in a higher and comprehensive sense a cosmical life, the whole\r\nforming one great Organism, in which the inorganic world, so called, is\r\nonly the foundation on which the animate creation stands.\r\n\r\nTo us, our own Earth is the most marked feature of Nature viewed on its\r\ninorganic side. To us it is the planet best known of all, or rather\r\nthe only one closely known, the point whence we draw conclusions on\r\nthe whole Universe, the resting ground for the glass that searches the\r\nKosmos, to use Humboldt’s word, discerning the place which the Earth\r\nholds in it, and prying into the mysteries of the entire creation. Our\r\nglobe is one of the major planets of our system, all of which gird the\r\nsun with great elliptic orbits, midway in which is our own. There begins\r\nthe first popular division of the planets,—those that are within and\r\nthose which are without our own orbit. This is one of the most simple of\r\ndiscriminations, one which we inherit from the ancients in an unmodified\r\nform. Humboldt retains this primary classification.\r\n\r\nThe external planets are those whose orbits embrace that of the Earth\r\nwithin their own. The minor planets are those whose orbits are embraced\r\nby that of the Earth. These are Mercury and Venus.\r\n\r\nThe ancients, counting both the sun and moon, reckoned only seven\r\nplanets. At the end of the eighteenth century another was added, Uranus,\r\nan external planet. Through the instrumentality of improved telescopes,\r\nsoon after, four minor ones were discovered, Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and\r\nVesta; and by the still more perfect lenses recently introduced, and the\r\nassiduity and skill of astronomers, the number of these little planetary\r\nbodies, ranging between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, has grown great.\r\nBeyond Saturn and Uranus is Neptune, discovered mathematically by Le\r\nVerrier, in Paris, and seen by Galle in Berlin, the 23d of September,\r\n1846.\r\n\r\nTo these (now eighty) planets may be added the twenty to thirty moons of\r\nour solar system, and a number of comets.\r\n\r\nThe middle position of the Earth’s orbit is not without its consequences.\r\nThe distance of the Earth from the Sun is, in round numbers, 92,000,000\r\nof miles, nearly three times as far as that of Mercury, the planet\r\nnearest the Sun. Jupiter, on the other hand, is five times as far from\r\nthe Sun as the Earth; Uranus about nineteen times as far, and Neptune\r\nabout thirty-three times as far.\r\n\r\nThe time of the Earth’s revolution around the Sun is also equally removed\r\nfrom the extremes; its year is 365 days; Mercury’s being 87 days;\r\nJupiter’s 11 of our years; Uranus 84 years; and Neptune’s 165 years.\r\n\r\nThe daily revolution of the Earth on its axis is also of only medium\r\nswiftness, consuming 24 hours. This, of course, controls the periods\r\nof waking and sleep of the entire animate creation on our globe. Some\r\nplanets revolve slower, some more rapidly than our own; Jupiter’s\r\nrevolution, for example, is accomplished in little less than 10 hours.\r\nThis extreme rapidity seems to account for the much greater flattening at\r\nthe poles of the planets than the Earth exhibits, occasioned doubtless\r\nduring the formation processes, while those immense revolving masses\r\nwere passing from their primitive fluid state into the more rigid forms\r\nin which we know them. Of all the planets, however, the Earth has most\r\nperfectly retained the spherical shape; and the spherical form is in one\r\nsense a medium form; i.e. it is removed from all extremes of angularity,\r\nand so falls in with the analogies which I am endeavoring to establish,\r\nspringing from the position of the Earth’s orbit _midway_ between those\r\nof the inner and outer planets. According to Plato, the beauty of form\r\nlies in symmetry, and our Earth is the most symmetrical of planets,\r\nand, unquestionably, the spherical shape is the one best adapted to the\r\ndisplay of the largest number of phenomena possible.\r\n\r\nThe variations from the spherical form, produced by elevations and\r\ndepressions, are only of medium magnitude in our globe compared with\r\nmany others in our system. On the smaller planet of Venus, for example,\r\nthe mountains are thought to rise to a height of many miles, while five\r\nis the greatest altitude of ours. According to Mädler’s conjectures,\r\nthe mountains in our own moon rise to a height of over three miles, an\r\naltitude altogether out of proportion to the size of the moon as compared\r\nwith the earth.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the number of its moons, too, our Earth is no extremist; it\r\nhas but one: other planets, Mercury, Venus, Mars, have none. On the other\r\nhand, Jupiter has 4, Saturn 7, Uranus 6 at least, and doubtless more. The\r\ngeneral law seems to be, the farther from the Sun the greater the number\r\nof moons; perhaps in the wonderful providence of God, to compensate the\r\nfeeble light of those distant realms by the number of the reflecting\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nNow, summing up all that has been said, it will be seen that the Earth is\r\nequally far removed from every extreme. This fundamental classification,\r\ndrawn from the place of its orbit in relation to those nearer the Sun or\r\nmore distant from it, gives it a character which is felt and seen in many\r\ndifferent things, and responds to analogies which it is not incorrect\r\nto mark. A _medium_ is seen in all its attributes and relations: it is\r\nneither the largest nor the smallest of planets; neither the swiftest\r\nnor the slowest; neither the warmest nor the coldest; in nothing is\r\nit either at a minimum nor at a maximum point. And this very medium\r\ncharacter brings the Earth into harmony with the system of which it forms\r\na part; the symmetry of the one corresponding with the symmetry of the\r\nother, and specially fits it to become the temporary home of a race like\r\nours, which makes the whole surface of the globe tributary during the\r\nshort terrestrial life of man to his preparation for a celestial state\r\nof being. Our globe is certainly the only one of our system which could\r\npossibly be inhabited by man; and as his residence, and as the arena for\r\nhis culture, it is worthy of being studied in all its features; no point\r\nis too trifling to be overlooked.\r\n\r\nAs man looks for a center to the system which _evidently_ pertains to\r\nhim, and in which our Earth plays no slight part, the Sun is clearly\r\nthe source of a large share of what makes our life desirable. Thence we\r\nreceive light, warmth, and indirectly, and yet directly too, life and\r\nthe bloom of health. Nor can men, even if ignorant and degraded, _help_\r\nseeing the relation of the Sun to the Earth, and linking, in their rude\r\nthoughts, the heavens with the earth; and hence, before all higher\r\nRevelation, the worship of the Sun has been the primitive instinct of the\r\noldest of nations.\r\n\r\nLooking at the earth as simply one among the innumerable hosts of heaven,\r\nit, like each one of them, becomes to the imagination a mere point of\r\nlight, a “star among stars.” But, when we shift our point of view, and\r\nleaving the cosmical or universal for the special, for what pertains to\r\nthe individual life, the mere point of light flames up into a great,\r\nbusy world, full of phenomena demanding investigation and thought.\r\nAnd yet this world, so attractive in its multiplicity of details, is\r\nalmost a chaos at the first sight; a confused and inextricable mass, so\r\nlarge, so high, so deep as to defy human effort to compass or master it.\r\nScience alone, the gift and the growth of centuries, can measure the\r\nfield; science alone can enter it and reduce the chaos to a beautiful\r\nand orderly grouping, and make a perfect picture of the whole; it alone\r\ncan dispel crude ideas and give truer ones in their stead. To the rude\r\ndweller on the plain, the earth seems a gigantic floor, as it did to many\r\na tribe in the past, and as it does to-day to thousands of wondering\r\nArabs. The South Sea Islander, in the Pacific, takes his island or island\r\ngroup to be the whole earth; the world he considers an endless ocean\r\nplain, from which the Sun arises, and, when the day is over, into which\r\nit sinks. And even within the pale of civilization itself, the ignorant\r\nNeapolitan lazzarone considers his gulf the center of the world.\r\n\r\nAs men advance in their inquiries, and, ascending the sides of mountains,\r\nlook out over a larger tract, or find new lands across the seas, they\r\ndo not outgrow their first idea, the world merely expands from the\r\nnarrow homestead to a larger circle, such as the Romans used to call\r\ntheir orbis terrarum. The conception of the earth as a vast, unsupported\r\nball, careering through the heavens, was the possession, slowly won, of\r\nsuch great minds as Pythagoras and Aristotle, and slowly found its way\r\namong the ideas which whole nations accepted as true. Circumnavigators\r\nmust sail around the globe and tell their story to the world before the\r\nconjectures of science could have real weight with the popular mind in a\r\nmatter so remote from the crude speculations of the ignorant as this. And\r\nless than one century and a half ago (in 1727) another step was taken,\r\nand the theory was propounded by Newton, that the Earth is a spheroid\r\nand not a perfect sphere. Later investigations have determined that the\r\nspheroidal form is only an approximation to perfect accuracy, and that\r\nthe Earth is a polyhedron, whose exact number of zodes has not yet been\r\ndetermined, and which may prove indeterminable. Bessel has assigned, as\r\nthe great task of science for the coming century, to settle this question\r\nwith perfect exactness. But what has been said is enough to indicate that\r\nin our knowledge, at present, certainly there is only progress, only\r\napproximation, no absolute exhaustion of the processes of discovery.\r\n\r\nAnd just as in ruder lands each man looks at his own island, or village,\r\nas the center of the earth’s circle, so the ancients looked at the\r\nearth as the pivot of the universe, the central point around which all\r\nthe heavenly hosts revolve. That was the fundamental principle of that\r\nPtolemaic system which was older than Ptolemy; held in the most ancient\r\ntimes in Arabia, Babylon, Persia, and India, but first luminously\r\nexpanded in the proportions and with the dignity of a system by Ptolemy.\r\nIts outlines were, in one word, this: there are seven planets, the Moon,\r\nMercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn; each has its own\r\norbit, in which it is in a limited sense supreme, but they all revolve\r\naround the common center, the Earth. Beyond the seven, and including them\r\nall, is the Firmament, in which the other stars stand like golden nails\r\nin an imperishable floor; the whole vast external Firmament is opaque and\r\nmotionless.\r\n\r\nThe Ptolemaic system won and held the greatest regard in the ancient\r\nworld. Mohammed established it in the Koran as a truth of religion. The\r\nadvance of science revealed the falseness of the Ptolemaic scheme of the\r\nuniverse, and demonstrated the fact that the stars of heaven are not\r\nmere torch-bearers for us, and mere interpreters of human destinies, but\r\nare worlds like our own, our earth being but one of numberless thousands\r\nequally worthy of the Common Creator. The Copernican system, which was\r\nto re-create the whole domain of science, wrought this great change.\r\nThe Sun, according to this theory, forms the central point around\r\nwhich, and not around the Earth, all the planets wheel. Copernicus, in\r\n1543, left this imperfect and yet fruitful conception to his successors\r\nto unfold; and in the results gained by Kepler, in 1631, by Newton and\r\nGalileo, 1727, the Copernican system was firmly established. The vast\r\nimprovements in the telescope removed the limits of the visible universe\r\nto a place till then unrevealed, and added inexhaustible fields to those\r\nwhich had been known before. The number of the planets was enlarged.\r\nThe list of determined comets increases yearly. The number of the fixed\r\nstars has been determined by the extreme accuracy of such observers as\r\nLalande, Lacaille, Bessel, Argelander, and Lamont. The great work of\r\nmapping and cataloguing the heavens has been accomplished. Many hundred\r\nstars, supposed to be single fixed stars, have been ascertained to be\r\ndouble stars, and some have been resolved into systems like our own.\r\nThe 300-400, observed by Struve, have grown, through the labors of\r\nHerschel, in both the Northern and the Southern hemispheres, at the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, and elsewhere, to over 3000, and the number is constantly\r\nincreasing. Nebulæ have been analyzed, and been shown to consist of\r\nworlds distinct and perfect as our own. Thus there is a steady and\r\nperceptible advance in man’s conception of the Earth, of Nature, of what\r\nwe call the World and the Universe, though each individual, generation,\r\nand century are but dimly conscious of this progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH AS THE DWELLING-PLACE OF MAN.\r\n\r\nThe Earth draws our attention to itself, however, not as simply a unit\r\nin the planetary system, but as the home of the human race. The physical\r\ndescription of the globe includes the relations of the Earth as a star\r\namid the heavenly hosts, while Geography, taken most comprehensively,\r\nregards the Earth as the dwelling-place of Man. From a geographical\r\npoint of view, the world becomes to us the common home of our race, the\r\ntheater, not of the operations of Nature in the most unrestricted sense,\r\nbut the arena for the development of human life and history. The whole\r\nanimate and inanimate creation is tributary, looked at geographically,\r\nto the fashioning of the destiny of Man. Without Man as the central\r\npoint, Nature would have no interest to the geographer; without the\r\nEarth, constituted just as it is, the races of men and the course of\r\nhuman history could not claim his attention. The Earth is not only the\r\nbest known of planets, but, as the home of man, infinitely the most\r\ninteresting. The study of it is at the foundation of history as much as\r\nof physics.\r\n\r\nNo man of science can fail to regard it with the deepest interest.\r\n\r\nMore than a hundred years ago, George Foster remarked that European\r\nculture had ascended to that height, that it must include an intimate\r\nknowledge of all that is peculiar in the features and phenomena of the\r\nentire globe. How much more true is this remark in the middle of our\r\nnineteenth century! It is no longer European culture that demands this,\r\nbut the welfare of all countries claims of scholars this knowledge far\r\nmore imperatively than a hundred years ago. Still, it must be confessed\r\nthat we are far from the attainment of a perfect science of Geography,\r\nin its largest sense; the science which regards the Earth as the field\r\nof human discipline; the science of which what was formerly called\r\nGeography is only an outlying, rudimentary part. The compass of what it\r\nholds as its goal is too large, and its contents too varied for _his_\r\ngrasp whose existence is hemmed in by narrow bonds, and whose life is so\r\nbrief. And though there have always been detailed descriptions of the\r\ndifferent parts of the earth, many of them remarkable for their accuracy,\r\nyet there has been lacking a knowledge of the principle of organic unity\r\nwhich pervades the whole, and the mutual play and interdependency of\r\nall the parts. The whole subject of _relations_ was unstudied. And it\r\nis a knowledge of the relations of things that leads to a scientific\r\ninterpretation, not the description of detached parts. Geography was and\r\ncontinued to be mere description, not the teaching of the most important\r\nrelations. Only now are we beginning to comprehend the true elements\r\nof geographical science, only now are the first efforts made to deal\r\nprofoundly with this science, although the progress of discovery is still\r\ngoing on with unabated speed, leaving far behind us all the advances of\r\nour predecessors.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHY AS A SCIENCE.\r\n\r\nThe Earth, considered _per se_, is only a fragment of the Universe, of\r\nthe Kosmos, in that wide use of the word which Humboldt has given to\r\nit in his celebrated work. The Earth is the grand floor, so to speak,\r\nof Nature; the home, or rather the cradle, of men and of nations, the\r\ndwelling-place of our race. It is not merely a region of immense spaces,\r\na vast superficies, it is the theater where all the forces of Nature and\r\nthe laws of Nature are displayed in their variety and independencies.\r\nBesides this, it is the field of all human effort, and the scene of a\r\nDivine revelation. The Earth must be studied, therefore, in a threefold\r\nrelation: to the Universe, to Nature, to History.\r\n\r\nAnd it is not only as a mere passive agent, but active, that it assumes\r\nthis threefold relation. It is an inseparable, an integral, a working\r\nmember in the great system of things. But higher than this, and grander\r\nthan its relation to the system of _things_, is its relation to an unseen\r\nworld, to an unseen hand, even that of the Creator. We view it not as the\r\nfield of forces and laws and phenomena, but the crowning gift of God,\r\ndisplaying the tokens of perfect adaptation to our wants, full of beauty\r\nand excellence—a revelation of Divine wisdom, in the form of a visible\r\nworld. How beautifully has the inspired David painted this in the 104th\r\nPsalm!\r\n\r\nIn relation to its inhabitants, crowned with the Imperial gift of reason,\r\nthe Earth is not merely the place where they may stand, the cradle where\r\nthey may sleep, the home where they may live, it is the school where they\r\nmay be trained. This is one of the first and one of the greatest lessons\r\nthat we learn from the history of the race. The Earth finds its highest\r\nmission, not in its relation to inanimate nature, but to the world of\r\nintelligence—the minds that dwell upon it, the spiritual world to which\r\nit gives bodies. And as the Earth alone of the planets is adapted to be\r\nthe home of such a being as man, so in our world of animate and inanimate\r\nthings, man alone partakes of a moral nature, incapable of being shared\r\nor even imitated by the lower creatures. The Earth was made to be the\r\nhome of mind, soul, character. And Man was created to make this earth\r\ntributary to his largest growth in mind, and soul, and character. In\r\nthis sense the Earth and its noble possessors are correlative. Each\r\nindividual rises to his own appointed work, runs his own course, uses all\r\nthe appliances of Nature, all the help with which God invests him, and\r\nthen ceases from his mission here; but the Earth remains, the home of the\r\nadvancing millions, helping them all onward, and granting them new power\r\nto fulfill the noble purposes of human life.\r\n\r\nNor can this constitution of things be the result of a happy accident.\r\nEvidently under the supreme power of a Divine mind and will, Nature\r\nis made subservient to Man. That mutual working and interdependence\r\nof things, which opens to our comprehension the History of our race,\r\ncannot be ascribed to a fortuitous combination of events. It can only be\r\nthe result of Divine Providence. Had there been no wise ruling of the\r\nblind forces of nature, no subjection of the rough, unbridled powers of\r\nthe air, and sea, and earth, the human race would have become extinct,\r\nas so many races of beasts have done. But there are no traces of the\r\nextinction of a human race in our Paleontology. The constitution of the\r\nglobe is incontestably coincident with a plan to preserve and perfect\r\nMan. There are destructive agencies, it is true, but they do not operate\r\non an extended scale; our earthquakes, and volcanoes, and great storms at\r\nsea affect but a fraction of the race, they are no longer universal in\r\ntheir action; while, on the contrary, the instrumentalities which favor\r\nmankind remain in force—the earth’s changeless garment of green, the\r\nuniform progress of generation among subordinate creatures, the ease of\r\nacclimatization, and of transferring seeds and germs, with undiminished\r\nfruitfulness, from one region to another. The very agencies which, in the\r\ndawn of history, brought death, have been changed to auxiliaries of life\r\nwith us to-day.\r\n\r\nThe investigation into the relations of the Earth, in this respect,\r\nand into the organization of all the natural laws and phenomena in\r\ntheir bearing on man, his life and history, must constitute a prominent\r\ndepartment of true geographical science. When Geography ceases to be\r\na lifeless aggregate of unorganized facts, and becomes the science\r\nwhich deals with the earth as a true organization, a world capable of\r\nconstant development, carrying in its own bosom the seeds of the future,\r\nto germinate and unfold, age after age, it first attains the unity and\r\nwholeness of a science, and shows that it grows from a living root; it\r\nbecomes capable of systematic exposition, and takes its true place in\r\nthe circle of sister sciences. Philosophy gladly grants it a share in\r\nits own domain, and permits it to indulge in those soaring speculations,\r\nwhich it used to be thought that so simple a thing as Geography might not\r\nenjoy. Yet, it must not be denied that there has for some time been felt\r\na need of bringing the earth, as an organization, more into the light\r\nof scientific investigation. The study of final causes, the tracing of\r\ninfinite wisdom in the works of the Creator, the theories touching the\r\nfirst issue of all things, have grown out of this necessity. Many errors\r\nhave, doubtless, drifted in during the course of these speculations;\r\nman has undertaken to measure the Divine plan with most imperfect data,\r\nand the illusion has been too fondly cherished of attaining final and\r\nprofound results while men were scarcely in the possession of the\r\nelements of knowledge. It is for us, therefore, to enter upon our\r\ninquiries with investigation rather than theory, to test the knowledge of\r\nwhich tradition has put us in possession, and to advance, as we may, to\r\nthe new and the unexplored.\r\n\r\nMan is the first token that we meet, that our study of the earth must\r\ncontemplate it as an organized whole, its unity consummating in him. As\r\nevery individual must, in his own career, epitomize the history of the\r\nrace, childhood, youth, manhood, and decrepitude, so each man mirrors in\r\nhis own life the locality where he lives. Whether dwelling in the North\r\nor in the South, in the East or in the West, whether the shepherd of the\r\nTyrolese Highlands, or the Hollander of the plains, every man is, in a\r\nmanner, the representative of the home that gave him birth. In the people\r\nthe country finds its reflection. The effect of the district upon the\r\nnature of its inhabitants in size and figure, in color and temperament,\r\nin speech and mental characteristics, is unmistakable. Hence the almost\r\ninfinite diversity in the peculiarities of culture and attainment, as\r\nwell as of tendency in different nations. Anthropology and Ethnography,\r\nthe science of man and of race, are the running commentaries of Geography\r\nand Topography. The historian and the geographer work toward each\r\nother,—the historian going back from the acts of men to study the scenes\r\nwhich have conditioned their life, the geographer going forward from\r\nthe study of the habitat of men to that of their deeds. The fundamental\r\nquestion of history is, in fact, What relation does the country bear to\r\nthe national life? What relation to the civil structure, the state?\r\n\r\nIn fact, the whole constitution of Man is thoroughly connected with\r\nthe Earth on which he dwells; the roots of his being run down into it\r\nin uncounted numbers. Man receives at birth from the earth not only a\r\nspiritual but a physical dowry, from which he cannot free himself, and\r\nof whose worth he becomes conscious more and more. It is, therefore, of\r\ncourse one of the first of the legitimate studies to learn the limits of\r\nthe realm which Man makes his home, and to understand all its secrets,\r\nall its forces, so as to turn them to his own uses. Thus alone can he\r\ncompass the sublime thought of his own freedom, the independence of\r\nhis own will in the kingdom of Nature, and learn the majesty of his\r\nown spirit; for the knowledge of that freedom, which is the most noble\r\nof all God’s gifts to him, is the most direct key to the attainment of\r\nthat place in the present, and that destiny in the future, which God has\r\nappointed for man. Without a preliminary training, amid the conditions\r\nof a limited life, can there be no step taken toward the enjoyment of\r\nthe life without limitations which is to come. Without the capacity of\r\nbreaking the higher law, there is no glory in obeying it, no freedom\r\nto be valued, even in the world of thought. There can be no true\r\nspeculation, no philosophy of the unlimited and eternal, without inquiry\r\ninto and knowledge of the limited and conditioned. He who knows not the\r\nearthly, cannot know the heavenly; he who knows not the finite, cannot\r\nknow the infinite. Statement and counter-statement are the substance\r\nto the world of thought. Pythagoras investigated matters of number and\r\nweight, before he dealt with the mysteries of metaphysical speculation.\r\nPlato thought on the human soul, and the practical details of\r\nlegislation, before he gave himself to the deepest things of Philosophy.\r\nAristotle was a naturalist and physicist, before he became a logician and\r\nmetaphysician. Kant was a mathematician and astronomer, before he dealt\r\nwith the problems of transcendental science. Schelling went from natural\r\nphilosophy to the study of the soul of things. If there have been evil\r\nresults from this, it has not been from antedating metaphysical studies\r\nby physical, but by passing too quickly from the solid foundation-stones\r\nto the more unstable heights of the transcendental. Without these solid\r\nfoundation-stones, philosophy falls, crushed by its own weight; but with\r\nthis preparation, we may advance to the loftiest and yet most secure\r\nspeculations.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT GEOGRAPHY AS A SCIENCE HAS YET TO ACCOMPLISH.\r\n\r\nGeography can just as little be contented with being a mere description\r\nof the Earth, and a catalogue of its divisions, as a detailed account of\r\nthe objects in nature can take the place of a thorough and real natural\r\nhistory. The very word Geography, meaning a description of the Earth,\r\nhas unfortunately been at fault, and has misled the world: to us it\r\nmerely hints at the elements, the factors of what is the true science\r\nof Geography. That science aims at nothing less than to embrace the most\r\ncomplete and the most cosmical view of the Earth; to sum up and organize\r\ninto a beautiful unity _all_ that we know of the globe. The whole body\r\nof facts revealed by past and present discovery must be marshaled into\r\nharmony, before we gain the high pinnacle of Geographical Science. The\r\nEarth, in all its parts, must be known in all its relations, before we\r\ncan speak of it as the scholars of our day ought to speak of the world\r\nthey inhabit.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Earth is to be considered in two main relations—a relation,\r\nand an absolute relation; that is, we are to regard it in its connection\r\nwith the greater whole, of which it forms a part, the Universe, and\r\nas a body standing alone, existing, as it were, for itself. It is the\r\nlatter view which falls within the strict province of Geography. The very\r\nprominence of the old Greek word Γη indicates the pre-eminence which, in\r\nthis science, our own planet, rather than others, receives. _Ge_-ography\r\nconfines our attention to the Earth, and concentrates it upon the globe,\r\nregarded _per se_, rather than in its relations to the Universe. Taken,\r\ntherefore, strictly, as already hinted at in the foregoing remark,\r\nGeography is the department of science that deals with the globe in\r\nall its features, phenomena, and relations, as an independent unit,\r\nand shows the connection of this unified whole with man and with man’s\r\nCreator. Should we go beyond this, and discuss the relations of the Earth\r\nto the Universe, (as is often done in our geographical treatises, in a\r\nsingularly imperfect and unfruitful manner,) we should outrun the strict\r\nbounds of a single science, and should be encroaching on the domain of\r\nthe sister science of astronomy. This we have no right to do. Yet, from\r\ntime to time, we must borrow the results of other departments of learning\r\nto confirm our own. The field which we have to till has been immensely\r\nreduced in its proportions by the publication of “Kosmos,” which great\r\nwork has almost exhausted the subject of the earth in its external\r\nrelations. The limiting of our own department may, perhaps, give more\r\nopportunity for thorough investigation within itself.\r\n\r\nThe Earth, if discussed exhaustorily, must be spoken of in its relations\r\nto Time as well as to Space. The word by which we characterize it,\r\nin this regard, is History. The duration of the Earth outruns all\r\nmeasurement. By thinking of its beginning, is the only way we have of\r\ngaining a conception of Time. We cannot conceive of the universe as\r\nantedating the creation of our earth. By this indefinite, not to say\r\ninfinite, duration of time, the Earth is discriminated from all that\r\nit contains; it is older than any of its parts; it antedates all its\r\nkingdoms. The nature of the whole is, therefore, radically different from\r\nthat of any of its divisions. The Earth has had a development of its own;\r\nhence the too common error of treating it as passive and inorganic. The\r\nhistory of the Earth displays, in all the monuments of the past, that\r\nit has been subjected in every feature, in every division of itself,\r\nto ceaseless transformation, in order to show that, as a whole, it is\r\ncapable of that organic development on which I lay so much stress. The\r\nnatural powers which the earth includes are constantly obedient to the\r\nmechanical laws of chemistry and physics. The animate creation, plants,\r\nanimals, man, come and go, in accordance with the laws of their being,\r\nand as subordinate dependents on the great forces which the earth holds\r\nlocked up within her bosom. The earth, the mother of them all, has her\r\nown special advance, her own development, to use that overburdened German\r\nword. She has relations to herself alone; not simply to organized forms,\r\nplants, and animals; just as little to organic things; not simply to\r\nher own countries, her rocks, and her crystals. These are but isolated\r\nparts; or, if not isolated, yet bound _together_ by a common tie. There\r\nis another tie above this; it is that which binds the earth to itself\r\nalone; that subordinates its parts to such an extent that they almost\r\ndisappear. There is, above all this thought of parts, of features, of\r\nphenomena, the conception of the Earth as a whole, existing in itself,\r\nand for itself, an organic thing, advancing by growth, and becoming more\r\nand more perfect and beautiful. Without trying to impose on you anything\r\nvague and transcendental, I wish to lead you to view the globe as almost\r\na living thing,—not a crystal, assuming new grace by virtue of an\r\nexternal law,—but a world, taking on grandeur and worth, by virtue of an\r\ninward necessity. The individuality of the earth must be the watchword of\r\nre-created Geography. To think of the Earth, as a seed sown from the hand\r\nof God himself on the great fields of space, and filled with a germinant\r\npower of life, which will transform it more and more, and make it more\r\nand more worthy of its noblest inhabitant, is the first, as it is the\r\nlast, idea which we must take and keep in these inquiries.\r\n\r\nFormerly, Geography was regarded as a mere auxiliary of History,\r\nPolitics, Military Science, Natural History, the Industrial Arts, and\r\nCommerce. And in truth it does reach out and teach all these departments\r\nof knowledge and action; but only in the most recent times has it assumed\r\nthe place of an independent branch of study. Only through the widening of\r\nthe whole circle of sciences has room been made for this.\r\n\r\nGeography used, for the sake of commerce, to be divided into three\r\ndivisions: mathematical, physical, and political. This was at the time\r\nwhen it was thought that the whole frame-work of the sciences was a\r\ndisjointed and sundered thing; before that minor principle of unity\r\nwhich binds them all together was recognized as one of the noblest\r\nconceptions that the mind can cherish. In the first two of these\r\narbitrary divisions into which Geography was severed, the relations of\r\nastronomy, mathematics, and physics were studied, and their applications\r\nto the confused phenomena of the globe investigated. Yet the most\r\nimportant thing of all escaped notice; students overlooked their chief\r\ntask, the tracing of causation and interdependence in the phenomena, and\r\nthe relation of every one to the country which supplies its conditions\r\nof being. It was not suspected that each phenomenon was one link of a\r\ngreat chain of phenomena, the whole revealing a comprehensive law. Men\r\ndiscussed porphyritic formations, basaltic columns, hot springs, and\r\na thousand features which dot the earth, and a thousand kinds of rock\r\nwhich rift the surface of the globe, and treated them singly as if\r\neach was a spore and the whole combination only a sporadic group. They\r\ndid not discover that in the one feature was to be found the reason of\r\nthe existence of its neighbor; that all the layers of stone owe their\r\nsingularities of structure to one another rather than to themselves;\r\nthat each one stands in the closest connection with the upheaval of\r\nthe loftiest mountains, with the formation of great volcanic islands,\r\nand, in truth, with the building up of entire continents. And, in like\r\nmanner, plants were discussed as if they were obedient to no law of\r\ngrouping, as if they were scattered broadcast over the earth, having no\r\nrelation to zones of vegetation, to isothermal and isochimenal lines;\r\nas if, in fact, there was no suspicion of any principle underlying the\r\nvery existence of the whole vegetable kingdom. And so, too, with such\r\nphenomena as the Aurora Borealis; they were treated as isolated features,\r\nrather than in their relations to the globe; the connection was not seen\r\nbetween the maritime discoveries of voyagers and the great system of\r\noceanic currents, on which voyagers are so dependent; in fact, the whole\r\ninfluence of the world of matter on the world of mind was unexplored.\r\n\r\nAnd in order to study what was called Political Geography, a vast mass\r\nof materials was converted into a stiff, ritualistic frame-work, in\r\nthe effort to impose some system and imaginal completeness on it, and\r\nnot in order to grasp facts and truths in their mutual relations and\r\ninward life; they were merely arranged for convenient reference and\r\nfor available use in the departments of military science, politics,\r\nstatistics, and history; a method which is plainly our inheritance\r\nfrom the Middle Ages, and which bears the marks of those days. Thus\r\nfrom this arbitrary arrangement, made without reference to any\r\nindwelling necessity, sprang the three groups with which we are\r\nfamiliar: Chronography and Topography forming the first, Ethnography\r\nand Anthropology the second, and Statistics and History the third, or\r\nPolitical Geography.\r\n\r\nFrom these three groups our ordinary text-books compile their usual\r\naggregate of facts, and each becomes after its own pattern a motley\r\nin miniature. They contain variable quantities of this triple mass of\r\nmaterials, and follow no law but the demands of the time when they see\r\nthe light; they favor, like our light literature, the whim of the hour,\r\nand are political, military, or commercial, as the public may demand. A\r\nsystematic exposition of geography is very seldom to be found in them. A\r\nharmony of parts, a true harmony, is very rarely attained in their pages.\r\nThey are at the foundation only arbitrary and unmethodical collections\r\nof all facts which are ascertained to exist throughout the earth. They\r\nare arranged according to countries, or great natural divisions; but the\r\nrelation of one great natural division to another, the mutual and immense\r\ninfluence of one country on another, is never mentioned. The description\r\nof Europe follows in them to-day the same order in which Strabo set\r\nthe pattern. The facts are arranged as the pieces of a counterpane, as\r\nif every one existed in itself and for itself, and had no connections\r\nwith others. The setting out of these facts follows the rubrical method\r\nof grouping, according to boundary, soil, mountains, rivers, products,\r\nand cities. The beginning is usually made with _boundaries_ which are\r\ngenerally most unstable and uncertain, instead of being made with some\r\nrudimental fact around which all others arrange themselves as a center.\r\n\r\nIf we compare these geographical treatises with those made in the\r\ninterest of any other great department, we shall speedily discover that\r\nthey indicate knowledge rather than science; they form a mere aggregation\r\nand index of rich materials, a lexicon rather than a true text-book. And\r\ntherefore ensues, despite the undenied interest of the subject and its\r\nhigh claims, the mechanical and unfruitful method only too common—the\r\ncrowding of the memory without judgment, without thought; thence comes it\r\nthat Geography has taken so low a place among our school studies, worthy\r\nonly of the youngest of the pupils, and presenting little stimulus even\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nIt will be my effort, in the course of these lectures, to exhibit the\r\nsubject of relations rather than to detain you with descriptions; in\r\none word, to generalize rather than to add new details. In the lack of\r\na thoroughly excellent text-book of geography, I shall presuppose an\r\nacquaintance on your part with the materials, so to speak, of which the\r\nscience is to be constructed.\r\n\r\nIt has been a customary method to treat geography in connection with\r\nepochs of time; dealing with it as it was in the past and as it is in the\r\npresent. We hear of Ancient Geography, the Geography of the Middle Ages,\r\nand Modern Geography. In this course of lectures, it will be treated not\r\nas the property of one age or another, but rather as a growth of all\r\ntime, from Herodotus down to our day. It is only in this way that we can\r\nascertain what is permanent and what is ephemeral; only in this way can\r\nwe subject geography to that comparative method which has given such an\r\nimpetus to the advancement of the sister sciences of Natural History;\r\nonly in this way can we see how the present is the birthright of the\r\npast. Archæology, ethnography, and civil science are all gainers by this\r\nmethod of treatment; in one word, the whole domain of cotemporaneous\r\nstudy. The less positive knowledge we possess of the formative processes\r\nof science, the more crude our hypotheses, the more flagrant our errors.\r\nThis is constantly verified under our eyes; the errors of the past are\r\nthe wisdom of the present, and the gradual upheavals of our knowledge\r\nbecome indices, not less of outgrown untruths than of truths yet to be\r\nrevealed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE.\r\n\r\nThe sources of geography, as of history, are twofold—established\r\nmemorials and continued investigations. The study of it has this great\r\nadvantage at the outset, that the surface of the earth is a standing\r\nmonument of the past. We are obliged to search where all lies open; where\r\ninvestigation must be crowned with success. No manuscripts in this great\r\nlibrary have perished; they all exist as legible, as accessible as ever.\r\nMoreover, personal investigation must be made by every student in order\r\nto understand the results of the investigations of others. Wherever our\r\nhome is, there lie all the materials which we need for the study of\r\nthe entire globe. Humboldt hints at this when he says in his Kosmos:\r\n“Every little nook and shaded corner is but a reflection of the whole\r\nof Nature.” The roaring mountain brook is the type of the thundering\r\ncataract; the geological formations of a single little island, suggest\r\nthe broken coast lines of a continent; the study of the boulders which\r\nare so thickly scattered in token of a great primeval deluge from the\r\nnorth, reveals the structure of whole mountain chains. The digging of\r\nevery well may contribute to our knowledge of the earth’s crust; the\r\nexcavations made in the building of railroads may, without the loss of\r\ntime, labor, and expense, be a ceaseless source of instruction. In the\r\nstructure of a spear of grass, of a rush, of a single monocotyledon, may\r\nbe studied in miniature the palm-tree, prince of the tropics; in the\r\nmosses and lichens on our walls, the stunted growths of mountain tops\r\nmay be investigated. A small range of hills may be taken as the type\r\nof the loftiest Cordillera. The eye may be easily trained to see all\r\nthe greater in the less. The study of our own district is the true key\r\nto the understanding of the forms and the phenomena of foreign lands.\r\nWhoever has wandered through the valleys and woods, and over the hills\r\nand mountains of his own State, will be the one capable of following\r\na Herodotus in his wanderings over the globe. He, and he alone, will\r\nbe able, with true appreciation, to accompany travelers through all\r\nforeign lands. The very first step in a knowledge of geography is to know\r\nthoroughly the district where we live.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the text-books which we now possess do not discuss, with\r\nany approach to exhaustiveness, the districts where their readers live;\r\nand hence they cannot give any true inductive generalization of the large\r\nand the remote. In ancient times, the study of geography began with\r\nthe world of nature, not with the world of books. Herodotus, being 444\r\nyears B. C., became, by virtue of his investigations on his wanderings,\r\nthe first critical geographer of the Greeks. Polybius traveled through\r\nthe Alps and Pyrenees, Gaul and Spain, to be able to write the history\r\nof Hannibal’s campaigns. He explored the Black Sea and Egypt, in quest\r\nof facts. He is the father of all military geography; the greatest\r\nstrategists have busied themselves with writing commentaries on Polybius.\r\nStrabo, the most industrious geographer of his age, did not write till\r\nhe had traveled from the Caucasus to the Rhone, and from the Alps to\r\nEthiopia.\r\n\r\nPhilip Cluver, of Dantzig, who died in 1623, the true founder of\r\nclassical geography, collected, by personal investigations, the materials\r\nof his great work on Germany, Italy, and ancient Sicily, all of which\r\ncountries he traversed thoroughly, the classic authors in his hand.\r\n\r\nAlexander von Humboldt has become, by his thorough studies of nature in\r\nEurope, Asia, and America, the founder of Comparative Geography. He was\r\nthoroughly acquainted with every geographical form in the neighborhood\r\nof his home, before he traveled into foreign lands. These examples show\r\nthat personal investigation is one of the most reliable of all sources of\r\ngeographical knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe second class of these sources is the accounts given in the published\r\nmemoirs of travelers. In more primitive days than these, when very little\r\nwas known regarding the earth, personal examination was easily completed,\r\nwith a good degree of fullness, by almost any tourist. With the advance\r\nof knowledge, the narratives of travelers have increased, and the sum\r\ntotal of facts observed has become unwieldy; and, where facts have been\r\nwanting, the imagination has amply supplied their place. Of course,\r\na single life soon became too short for the personal examination of\r\nevery quarter of the globe; the narratives of those who had thoroughly\r\nexplored any one were accepted as authoritative, and these accounts soon\r\nbecame the most generally available of all the sources of geographical\r\nknowledge. Yet, with this limitation, that now their abundance and\r\ntheir exactness tend to repress and almost to destroy any personal\r\ninquiry whatever. Nothing can take the place of some exploration and\r\ninvestigation on the part of the student of geography.\r\n\r\nTo the accounts of scientific travelers, may be added those maps and\r\nglobes which indicate the contour and the vertical elevations and\r\ndepressions of the earth or its divisions. The demand for perfect\r\naccuracy in these is now very great. The map must be a portrait, not a\r\ncaricature. In its way, the map has a certain dictatorial authority; it\r\nis so decisive in its very character, that errors in it are far more\r\ndangerous than in the letter-press of books. The English excel in the\r\nbeauty of their maps: there are none in the world engraved with the\r\nrare excellence of theirs; but their care to secure accuracy is not\r\ncommensurate. The French and the Germans vie for the honor of perfectly\r\ntranscribing nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENCES ILLUSTRATIVE OF GEOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nThe sciences which are called in to illustrate the thorough study of\r\ngeography have largely increased in number within the past few years.\r\nThey are, for the most part, the same which illustrate history; to which\r\nmay be added mathematics and natural history. It is a very great mistake\r\nto suppose that all that bears upon geography can be crowded within\r\nthe covers of a single book. It is commonly supposed that geography\r\nis a matter of memory. Even in its elementary forms, it is capable of\r\na constructive treatment. Many a teacher, who has not paid special\r\nattention to this department, dreams that he can qualify himself by\r\nrunning through a single text-book. No philologist would dream that,\r\nwith a grammar and dictionary, he could grasp any constructive theory\r\nof language. There must first be the study, comparatively, of the great\r\nclasses. And in geography, the personal study of the earth, with critical\r\ncloseness, and in the comparative method, is the true way.\r\n\r\nAnother very common error is, that geography must subsidize what is most\r\nstriking in other sciences, and thereby gain its charms and attain its\r\nuses. Thus geography becomes everything—history, statistics, statecraft,\r\nphysics, a catalogue of all the possessions of natural history, in all\r\nits kingdoms. It takes on all colors, and meanwhile loses its own. It\r\nmerges all its individuality in other provinces. In no way can it\r\nescape this disintegrating force, unless by holding fast to some central\r\nprinciple of being; and that is the relation of all the phenomena and\r\nforms of nature to the human race. It cannot exist, if it is to be merely\r\nan aggregate of all science, a mosaic of all colors. It is to use the\r\nwhole circle of sciences to illustrate its own individuality, not to\r\nexhibit their peculiarities. It must make them all give a portion, not\r\nthe whole, and yet must keep itself single and clear.\r\n\r\nFor the comprehension of mathematical geography, a knowledge of the\r\nelements of mathematics and astronomy is indispensable. For determining\r\nlocalities, and for using many needed instruments, there must be some\r\nskill in practical astronomy; for measuring distances, for projecting\r\nmaps and charts, and locating geographical districts upon them, there\r\nmust be some familiarity with trigonometry and the higher mathematics.\r\nNo one can thoroughly study geography in foreign lands, and leave all\r\nastronomical instruments behind.\r\n\r\nPolitical geography demands an acquaintance with history, and the same\r\nhelps which the study of history requires. The civil status of no country\r\ncan be determined without this. Büsching’s “Europe” was a master-piece\r\nof its time. But it was impossible for even that book to compress within\r\nits covers the whole history of that continent in its relation to the\r\ngeography of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe study of Man is, of course, in most intimate alliance with geography.\r\nIt is only since the opening of this century that ethnography has become\r\na prominent and clearly defined province of science, and enabled to\r\nbecome a great tributary of geography; in fact, the greatest tributary.\r\nOther departments are also drawn upon; there can be no close study of\r\nthe soil, the structure of mountains and plains, without mineralogy and\r\ngeology. Meteorology, too, the science which discusses the climatic\r\nconditions of countries and the effects of climate upon the organization\r\nof plants, animals, and man, is of no mean value in illustrating\r\ngeography. Nor can one be a great geographer who does not understand the\r\nflora of the world. Not that he needs to be familiar with the myriads of\r\nplants, but the laws of growth and the characteristics of localization\r\nmust be known. The geographer does not need to repeat in detail where the\r\ncereals and the palm-tree thrive. The general conditions which control\r\nthe growth of plants are all that he has to concern himself with. The\r\nmain auxiliary for this is furnished in the botanical garden, where the\r\neye sees the products of all localities, arranged, according to their\r\ngrouping, in the countries where they are indigenous. Botany and zoology\r\nand mineralogy are among the sciences most valuable in throwing light\r\nupon geography; they display best what wealth each country holds in store\r\nfor the uses of man; for they are closely connected with the development\r\nof industry, the arts, and trade.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the last province, commerce, the science of\r\ninterchange. The study of minerals, of the distribution of plants and\r\nanimals, is of little advantage, aside from commerce and its uses to man.\r\nIt is the interchange of the products of one region for those of another\r\nwhich has had, on the whole, the greatest influence on the human race.\r\nThink, for an instant, of the transfer of the potato from America to\r\nEurope, of maize to Asia; of the far more ancient introduction of wheat\r\nand rice from Asia into Europe; and not these alone, but almost all the\r\nfruits. Think of the carrying from Asia to America, and, in fact, to all\r\ntropical lands, such products as sugar, coffee, and cotton. Think, too,\r\nof the results of the search for gold, ivory, and slaves in the interior\r\nof Africa, and of gold in California and Australia, opening such immense\r\ndistricts to settlements. The search after platina has disclosed the most\r\nguarded recesses of the Cordilleras and the Ural chain; while the need\r\nof copper first gave us our complete knowledge of the great system of\r\nAmerican lakes. Without the expeditions to secure the whale, the walrus,\r\nand the seal, as well as the fur-bearing animals, the polar world would\r\nbe still untraversed. The discovery of coal on a hundred shores otherwise\r\nunknown, led to the settlement of man in colonies from India and China\r\nsouthward to the Antarctic Continent, and northward to Nova Zembla,\r\nSpitzbergen, and Greenland.\r\n\r\nAnd not the continents only, seas and oceans have been thoroughly\r\nstudied, in order to secure a safe pathway for man to the regions which\r\ncontain his spoils. In the furtherance of this, the highest praise\r\nmust be awarded to the British government. Through its enterprise and\r\nliberality, almost every island group has been examined, a thorough study\r\nof marine currents undertaken, careful soundings made in all waters, and\r\na most extensive chartography accomplished. The charts published by the\r\nEnglish admiralty already are counted by thousands.\r\n\r\nYet the French have not been backward in like investigations.\r\nUnderstanding the value of commerce, their Dépôt de la Marine has not\r\nbeen inactive. Scandinavia has also done her part. The United States\r\nhas accomplished one of the most thorough coast surveys ever undertaken\r\nby any nation; its difficulties are only to be measured by its extent.\r\nIn fact, the whole civilised world has sent its messengers to the\r\nends of the earth, and have united in this grand crusade of our age,\r\nthe enriching of all men by a liberal system of interchange of the\r\ncommodities of all climes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE GEOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nTHE SURFACE OF THE EARTH CONSIDERED IN ITS MOST GENERAL RELATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spheroidal Form of the Earth.\r\n\r\nThe measurements of, and investigations into the figure of the earth,\r\nhave led, as already stated in the introduction, to no absolutely\r\ncertain conclusion; yet they have made it certain that the earth is, in\r\na general sense, a spheroid. There are many discrepancies, as were then\r\nstated, from the perfectly spheroidal shape; still it is in this sense\r\na spheroid, that the polar diameter is not of the same length with the\r\nequatorial diameter.\r\n\r\nThe globular form of the earth, using that word in a loose sense, has\r\nbeen established with certainty since Newton’s time. The experience of\r\ncircumnavigators, the uniform shield-shape of the shadow of the earth\r\nduring eclipses of the moon, are witnesses to this. The gradual emerging\r\nand disappearance of objects, such as ships on the sea, in coming and\r\ngoing, caravans on the desert, of mountains as they are approached,\r\nestablish the fact. These proofs are so well known that we but touch on\r\nthem and pass to what is not so obvious.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the fact was established that the earth was a subordinate\r\nmember of a system, it was brought into analogy with other planets, and\r\ntheir uniformly spherical shape was considered another valid reason for\r\nattributing the same to our globe. The discovery of the rotation of the\r\nearth on its axis was still another argument in the same direction.\r\nMathematical measurements and observations of the pendulum, taken at\r\ndifferent stations, have confirmed the same result.\r\n\r\nTo measure a spherical body, it is only necessary to take the length of\r\na degree in one of its great circles, and to multiply its length by 360,\r\nthe number of degrees. The method of measuring a degree on the earth’s\r\nsurface is by taking two stars, just one degree apart, dropping, by\r\nastronomical and mathematical means, vertical lines upon the earth from\r\nthem and measuring the distances apart of the points where those lines\r\nimpinge upon the globe. This can be done with perfect accuracy. Such\r\ninvestigations show that the degrees are not all of equal length, as\r\nthey would be were the earth a perfect sphere. Nearer the poles they are\r\nlonger, nearer the equator they are shorter. The curvature of the earth\r\nis therefore greater as you approach the equatorial line, and less as you\r\nrecede from it. In general terms, then, the earth is an oblate spheroid,\r\nas it would be a prolate spheroid were the lengths of its diameters\r\nreversed. By the most accurate measurements, those of the astronomer\r\nBessel, if the equatorial diameter were divided into 289 equal parts, the\r\npolar diameter would measure 288 of them, being ¹⁄₂₈₉ shorter.\r\n\r\nTo this must be added what was said in the introduction, that the\r\nsurprising accuracy of modern instruments and modern investigations,\r\napplied to meridian circles and parallels of latitude, have determined\r\nthe fact that the spheroid is not a perfect one, (just as so often in\r\nnature the ideal is rather striven after than attained,) but an irregular\r\npolyhedron of an indeterminate number of sides. Still for all practical\r\npurposes, these minute inquiries have no value, and it is enough to\r\ntreat of the earth as a perfect globe, so far, at least, as map-drawing\r\nis concerned. The deviation from a perfectly spherical shape is so\r\ninconsiderable that in an artificial globe of eighteen inches diameter it\r\nwould hardly amount to the thickness of a sheet of paper; still, small\r\nas this is represented on a miniature scale, it has, doubtless, great\r\nimportance on the great scale of a world like this, both in affecting\r\nsomewhat the perturbation of other heavenly bodies which depend on the\r\nearth, as well as the perturbations in the earth’s own motion. Besides\r\nthis, which is really not a small point in consideration of the possible\r\nresults which the minutest perturbation of one little planet may have\r\non the universe, there is one other, more appreciable in its results,\r\nthe probable influence of this spheroidal, or rather polyhedrons form,\r\nin producing the unequal division of land and water upon the surface\r\nof the earth. The apparent want of any principle or reason for this\r\ninequality has long perplexed geographers, and there seems to be no\r\nmore satisfactory solution than the one to which I have just alluded.\r\nIn the course of future investigations into the yet undetermined exact\r\nmathematical form of the earth, the law which controls the division into\r\nland and water will be more thoroughly understood. Unquestionably the\r\nposition of the great oceans depends upon their distance from the center\r\nof the globe, and although the present proportion of land and water seems\r\nfortuitous, undoubtedly it has a uniformly acting, and a thoroughly\r\nappreciable law.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Threefold Covering of the Earth.\r\n\r\nWhat may in the largest and most general sense be called the superficies\r\nof the earth, is threefold in character, and yet one in function;\r\nconsisting of a highly elastic body, the atmosphere, water, and the solid\r\nground. These three forms are variously proportioned; the more elastic is\r\nuniversal, the fluid form is more restricted, and the solid one prevails\r\nstill less. The more dense the body, the nearer it is found to the center\r\nof the earth. The lightest of all floats over the entire periphery of the\r\nglobe like a graceful mantle of cloud. Man, and in fact all organisms,\r\nlive by contact with all three of these forms. The investigation of the\r\nelements, and phenomena of the air, _regarded in themselves_, is the\r\nprovince of meteorology. The mercury-column is the true language of the\r\natmosphere, and tells us in distinct tones of all the changes there.\r\nMineralogy and geology make us acquainted with all the qualities and all\r\nthe elements of the soil, not in their relation to man, but regarded in\r\nthemselves. Geography deals with the conflict of all these bodies, their\r\nrelations to each other, their mutual action and reaction. Meteorology\r\ngives occasion for the study of climate, and for the observation of\r\nthe phenomena of the lower strata of the atmosphere,—the fall of rain\r\nand snow, for example. Geology and mineralogy give rise to the study\r\nof plains and mountain formations, as well as of volcanic phenomena,\r\naffecting the surface of the earth as they do in earthquakes, upheavals\r\nof whole districts, and the opening of hot springs. Thus, geography has\r\nit own province clearly defined, and uses all this and studies it in\r\nrelation to the organic world, and to man foremost of all.\r\n\r\nThe most highly elastic covering of the earth is unbroken, the other two\r\nare sundered, and each only occupies a part of the surface. Formerly, in\r\nmost ancient times, the water seems to have covered the entire earth.\r\nThe study of this is, however, within the domain of geology. We have to\r\ndo only with the historic period which followed. We have to look at the\r\nearth in its present relations, and as the home of man. Now, the portions\r\ncovered with water are, by far, the largest part of the surface; a little\r\nless than three-fourths are water, a little more than one-fourth land.\r\nThe whole water-mass is composed largely of the oceans, which, in one\r\nsense, constitute a continent of their own: in looking at them as we do\r\nnow, we are not to regard them as ceasing at the outlines of the great\r\nland-masses, but as penetrating these as far as to the springs which feed\r\nthe rivers; for the world of waters, embracing springs, brooks, rivers,\r\nlakes, seas, and oceans, is one, and but one.\r\n\r\nThe water is, in some respects, a form between the other two; its\r\npeculiarities, weight, density, freedom of movement, and changeableness\r\nof form, are a mean between the opposing extremes of air and the ground.\r\nWater can pass to a more fluid or a more solid state; it can become\r\nvapor or ice. The measurement of the depth of the world of waters has\r\nlately been so clearly connected with the needs of civilization, that\r\ngeographers have made many exceedingly accurate investigations. Formerly,\r\nthis was much neglected; up to Captain Cook’s time 1500 feet was the\r\ngreatest depth ascertained; in the course of the Arctic discoveries\r\n7000 feet limited the plummet’s descent; Captain Ross sounded, near St.\r\nHelena, to a depth of 30,000 feet; and Captain Denhorn, in the South\r\nAtlantic, reached a point 46,000 feet from the surface—about twice the\r\nheight of the loftiest mountains. And not single points alone, but\r\nentire ocean districts have been traversed; the temperature of these\r\ngreat depths has been studied, the currents, the density, in fact all the\r\nfeatures which must be known preliminarily to the laying of great lines\r\nof submarine telegraphs, such, for example, as that proposed between\r\nNorth America and Europe.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere, too, is by no means thoroughly known to us. It rises\r\nto a height between 85 and 95 miles from the earth, of which man has\r\nexplored in balloons only about five miles, or the height of the loftiest\r\nmountains. At loftier heights than we can live, the bright light of\r\nmid-day even fades into a dim kind of twilight, and meteoric masses of\r\niron are seen in full glow, there being oxygen enough even there to\r\nsupport their combustion, and very little resistance to overcome from\r\nthe density of the atmosphere. Astronomers, Benzenberg in particular,\r\nhave calculated the distance of the meteors to range from 23 to 100 miles\r\nfrom the earth, and have studied them[2] in respect to the time when they\r\nwere visible, their locality, and their direction. The limits of the\r\natmosphere must be at that point where the expansive power of air and the\r\nattractive influence of the globe neutralize each other. The form of the\r\natmospheric body is therefore, like the earth, spheroidal, but far more\r\noblate than the earth, in consequence of its much greater fluidity. At\r\nthe poles, the distance is therefore much less from the surface of the\r\nearth to the confines of the atmosphere than at the equator. The effect\r\nof this upon the refraction of light must be very great.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of the interior of the earth is more difficult to us\r\nthan that of the atmosphere even. We cannot say that we _know_ thoroughly\r\nmore than we can learn by penetrating ¹⁄₆₀₀₀ part of the distance to\r\nthe center of the globe. Deeper than that our lowest shafts have not\r\nsunk. The coal mines of England penetrate perhaps the farthest below the\r\nsea level; for the deep mines in Germany, in the Hartz district, for\r\ninstance, have their entrance hundreds of feet above it. One coal mine\r\nnear Durham, England, descends to a depth of about 1584 feet, and reaches\r\na point where the thermometer is 79° Fahrenheit. The deep coal mines of\r\nEngland have, however, one rival, in a shaft at Liege, which is sunk 1800\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe modern Artesian well has gone to still greater depths, in the effort\r\nto procure brine for the manufacture of salt, or fresh water for the\r\nuse of cities. At Rehme, in Porta Westphalica, a point 2160 feet from\r\nthe surface has been reached, and water brought up at a temperature\r\nof 90° Fahrenheit, containing four per cent. of salt. By an ingenious\r\napplication of mechanics to the process of well boring, doubtless a depth\r\nof 5000 feet could be attained. At Mondorf, in Luxemburg, a bore has been\r\nmade through sandstone and the mineral formations lying beneath it, for a\r\ndistance of 2700 feet, and water reached at 82° Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nThe great upheavals caused by earthquakes and volcanoes disclose still\r\nvaster depths. In the eruptions of the latter, immense masses of the\r\ninner contents of the earth are thrown out, sometimes enough to form a\r\nnot insignificant mountain, and to desolate large regions with their\r\ndebris. As a general thing, the original mineral forms are lost and\r\nindistinguishable in the molten mass. Yet not seldom perfect specimens\r\nare hurled out, imbedded in lava and cinders; not always minute\r\nfragments, sometimes huge blocks, testifying not with any degree of\r\ncompleteness, yet clearly, to a certain extent, of the composition of the\r\nregion bordering on the great inner sea of molten matter. Yet most of\r\nour knowledge upon this subject is hypothetical, and what we know only\r\nindicates painfully the great extent of that of which we are entirely\r\nignorant.\r\n\r\nThe uniform increase of temperature, as we descend into the earth, at the\r\nrate of about 24° Fahrenheit for every 100 feet, the heat of some mineral\r\nsprings, leads to the conclusion that, could we advance to a place about\r\ntwenty-three miles from the surface, we should attain the limits where\r\nall becomes a molten mass. The cold surface, on which we walk in such\r\nsecurity, seems, by all analogies, to envelop a liquid caldron which has\r\nbeen seething from the morning of the world. This internal mass is, of\r\ncourse, the source of all volcanic eruptions, and of all the phenomena to\r\nwhich I have alluded above. A distinguished geologist has well said that\r\n“light and heat are the two extremes of being: the farther man goes away\r\nfrom the earth’s surface, he encounters light; the farther he recedes\r\ninwardly from its surface, he encounters heat.” It is true we are not\r\nabsolutely certain that the rate of increase is uniform, at the rate of\r\none degree Fahrenheit for every 45 feet; but if it is, we should reach\r\nthe boiling point of water at less than 10,000 feet from the surface, and\r\nthe melting point of iron (22° Fahrenheit) a little over 120,000 feet.\r\nThe relation of this thickness to the entire diameter of the earth is\r\nabout as 1 to 344, about the ratio of the thickness of an egg-shell to\r\nthe egg.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Superficial Dimensions of the Land and Water on the Globe.\r\n\r\nThe equatorial diameter of the earth, 7925·6 miles, multiplied into\r\nthe circumference, 24898·8, equals 197,339,590, the number of square\r\nmiles on the earth’s surface, reckoning as if of a true sphere. The\r\ndeduction to be made, in consequence of its spheroidal shape, has not\r\nyet been estimated with any approach to nicety. The sum indicated above\r\nis exact enough to satisfy geographical purposes; enough to lead to\r\nthe laws of relative rather than to a minute individualization. The\r\nproportion even of land to water has not been determined, except with\r\napproximate accuracy. It has been commonly stated that two-thirds are\r\nwater and one-third land; others have computed three-fifths to be water\r\nand two-fifths land. The most accurate measurements, those instituted by\r\nHumboldt, have left it in this statement, that if the whole be taken as\r\none, the sea occupies ·734, the land ·265, or, reduced and simplified in\r\nalmost unchanged form, a little more than three-quarters water, a little\r\nless than one-quarter land. Of course it is impossible, as yet, to attain\r\nto accuracy in these estimates, as our knowledge is imperfect regarding\r\nthe polar regions; there are about 17,000,000 square miles unexplored.\r\n\r\nThe ascertaining of superficial areas with exactness is one of the\r\nmost costly operations undertaken in the interest of science. The\r\nfirst mathematical survey of France, one hundred and fifty years ago,\r\nundertaken by Cassini, cost four millions; the second sixteen millions;\r\na third, still more costly, has been made within the present century.\r\nStill, it must be said that few countries have expended money in this\r\ndirection with as much prodigality as France. In Turkey, for instance,\r\nso little accuracy has been attained, that the survey of that country,\r\nundertaken by Beauchamp early in this century, resulted in establishing\r\nthe Sultan in possession of 17,000 square miles which he had supposed\r\nwere covered by the Black Sea. The recent surveys of Prussia have\r\nrectified similar mistakes, and, in the constantly increasing accuracy,\r\nhave given hundreds of square miles to the Crown. Many countries, and\r\nin truth the most, have never been subjected to a strict mensuration.\r\nThe jagged coast lines of islands and continents have been so great a\r\nbarrier, that we have to speak with great uncertainty of the superficial\r\ncontents which they inclose. The statements of these make no pretense,\r\ntherefore, to accuracy. We must be content, at present, with the rudest\r\napproximation. This accounts for the discrepancy in our geographical\r\ncompendia; no two of them agree, unless one servilely copies the other.\r\nThe statistics relating to the superficial contents of continents, and\r\nof separate countries, must be taken with a great deal of allowance. The\r\nevil cannot be remedied at present; it will be, doubtless, at some future\r\nday. The discrepancies which it occasions will be seen, from the fact\r\nthat the area of Europe has been computed to be between 3,254,800 and\r\n3,870,500 square miles; that of Asia between 16,180,000 and 16,831,600;\r\nthat of Africa between 11,257,200 and 11,513,600; that of America between\r\n12,140,400 and 15,963,600; that of Australia between 2,756,000 and\r\n3,201,200 square miles.\r\n\r\nAccording to this, Asia is five times as large as Europe, and almost\r\nsix times as large as the continent of Australia. Africa is three times\r\nas large as Europe. America is four times as large as Europe, and is\r\nas large as Africa and Australia combined. Europe would make about\r\none-third of Africa, one-quarter of America, one-fifth of Asia. Our\r\npresent knowledge does not allow us to speak more definitely nor exactly.\r\n\r\n\r\nContrast of the Land and Water Hemispheres.\r\n\r\nWhether we divide the globe into northern and southern or eastern and\r\nwestern hemispheres, their relative amounts of land and water will be\r\ndifferent The northern hemisphere contains (speaking approximatively\r\nas above) 38,541,600 square miles of land, and 59,619,700 of water;\r\nthe southern, 12,847,200 of land, and 85,526,100 of water. The eastern\r\nhemisphere contains 36,760,800 square miles of land, and 61,401,000 of\r\nwater; the western, 14,628,000 of land, and 83,533,300 of water.\r\n\r\nBesides the division quantitatively, the division in respect to symmetry\r\nof shape is entirely irregular. Symmetry, as we usually use the word,\r\nconsists in the arrangement of parts at equal distances, or two sides at\r\nleast, from some central point or line. Mineral crystals are regarded in\r\nrelation to the point where crystallization began; plants are viewed in\r\nrelation to the stem-axis; animals in relation to the symmetry of the\r\nentire structure. A similar law of symmetry is entirely wanting to the\r\nglobe; its arrangement is altogether unlike this; it is not nearly so\r\nperceptible at first glance, yet it is far more profound in design and\r\ncomprehensive in its relations.\r\n\r\nThe land is broken up into masses, varying in size, and called,\r\narbitrarily, continents and islands. Strictly speaking, there are but two\r\ncontinents, the old world forming one, the new world the other. Australia\r\nmay be called the smallest continent or the largest island; it is the\r\nconnecting link between the forms, and shows at a glance the arbitrary\r\ndistinction. We might easily go further and call New Guinea, Borneo,\r\nSumatra, Great Britain, and Java, continents, and, on the other hand, we\r\nmight designate the old and the new world as islands. There is nothing\r\nabsolute here but the usage of speech.\r\n\r\nThe continents and islands lie mainly in the northern hemisphere,\r\n(38,341,600 square miles,) scarcely a third part of their superficies\r\n(12,847,200 square miles) being in the southern.\r\n\r\nThe continents are so situated also that the eastern contains by far\r\nthe largest body of land, (36,760,800 square miles,) the western being\r\nonly about one-third as large, (13,628,000 square miles.) America, the\r\nwestern, it will be seen, has no first-class island lying near it; it\r\nstands isolated.\r\n\r\nIt is seen by this that the greatest mass of land lies in the northern\r\nhemisphere, dividing the earth in one way, and in the eastern dividing\r\nit in another; the smallest mass in the southern and the western. In the\r\nnortheast the watery realm is the most contracted, in the southwest the\r\nleast. We are thus enabled to speak of the land side of the globe, the\r\nland hemisphere, and a water side, the water hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe central point of the water hemisphere is at the island of New\r\nZealand. Toward this the points of all the continents are directed.\r\nThe center of the land hemisphere is in the northwest of Europe, at a\r\npoint near southeast of England, the northeast of France, and the coast\r\nof Holland. The dwellers around the North Sea are the antipodes of the\r\nNew Zealanders. Great Britain is the country which, as a whole, is the\r\nmiddle point of the continental world. In the oceanic world, the islands\r\nlie like scattered dots, insignificant in respect to area, in comparison\r\nwith the waste of waters which surrounds them, while, on the other hand,\r\nthe land hemisphere is so solidly compacted, that even the Arctic Ocean\r\nbecomes merely a broad channel.\r\n\r\nThus arises the first great contrast which we have to study: the first,\r\nand next to the great primary distinction between the North and South,\r\nthe most important. The division into land and water, aside from\r\ncommerce, must exercise the strongest influence on the distribution of\r\nheat and cold, affecting the temperature of all the zones. This influence\r\nhas been fully noticed and brought before the world by Alexander von\r\nHumboldt. It is sufficient to refer to it now as a well-determined fact\r\nin physical geography.\r\n\r\nThe heat equator is a little farther north than the mathematical\r\nequator, because the land hemisphere has a greater heat capacity (if we\r\nmay use an awkward but apt word) than the water hemisphere. All other\r\nisothermal lines are modified in their greater or less coincidence with\r\nthe parallels of latitude as they advance from the heat equator toward\r\nthe maximum of the land hemisphere, or, in general terms, as they go\r\nnorthward. In the western hemisphere the isothermal lines follow much\r\nmore exactly the parallels of latitude than in the eastern, which is\r\npre-eminently the land hemisphere. In America the proximity of immense\r\nmasses of water causes a perceptible reduction of the heat from that of\r\nthe eastern where the land form prevails. And the heat diminishes more as\r\nwe advance toward the South Pole, than toward the North, in consequence\r\nof the greater deficiency of land in the southern hemisphere; while in\r\nLapland, Greenland, and in Siberia, even within the polar circle itself,\r\nmen find sustenance and trees live, in the same latitude, at the South\r\nPole, no vegetable life, worth mentioning, is found. The frigid zone and\r\nthe temperate zone of the southern hemisphere are not coincident with\r\nthose of the northern. The icebergs which are formed at the South Pole\r\nare carried much nearer to the equator than those found at the North Pole.\r\n\r\nAn important phenomenon, first pointed out by A. von Humboldt and Dove,\r\nis closely connected with what has just been said. The Atlantic shores\r\nof the old world are warmer than those in the same latitude of the new\r\nworld. Norway, England, and France are warmer than Labrador and Canada;\r\nSpain, Portugal, and Morocco are warmer than Florida; Congo and Benguela\r\nare warmer than Brazil, although the countries brought in contrast all\r\nlie on the same parallel.\r\n\r\nA similar analogy is drawn from the west shore of America: Northern\r\nCalifornia is warmer than Japan and Corea, which are in the same\r\nlatitude. It is true, other factors are at work to produce this, such as\r\nwinds, marine currents, elevations of land, etc., of which more will be\r\nsaid hereafter.\r\n\r\nBoth of the two great land divisions of the earth, it will thus be\r\nseen, have their peculiarities. But there is a great equalizer of their\r\ndiversities, found in a great coast-belt, of which I must briefly\r\nspeak. It passes from the Cape of Good Hope northeasterly at an angle\r\nof 45°, passing through the Mozambique channel, thence skirting the\r\nentire southeastern and eastern coast of Asia, taking in China, Corea,\r\nJapan, and South Kamtckatka; thence it turns southward, following the\r\nwhole western shore of America to Cape Horn. This belt is broken at\r\nonly two points—a brief break at the north, at Behring’s Straits, and a\r\nlarge one between Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope; in other words,\r\nat the points nearest to the North and the South Poles respectively.\r\nThis coast belt has a relation to the habitable world similar to that\r\nheld by the temperate zone as a mediator between the torrid and the\r\nfrigid. It partakes of the character of the sea and the land, and shows\r\nthe advantages of both. It does not run parallel with the lines of\r\nlatitude, but crosses them diagonally, in the same direction with the\r\necliptic, though at a more acute angle. This belt moderates all extremes.\r\nCoincident with it are the paths of the sea and land winds, the course\r\nof the monsoons, the most fertile shores of the whole globe. It divides\r\nthe surface of the globe into three great divisions, the two great bodies\r\nof water, and the great, and, comparatively speaking, unbroken (for the\r\nbreak at Behring’s Straits is of little importance) land-mass. On the\r\ngreat coast line referred to above is the center of the great natural\r\nacclivities of the globe. It is the most varied, the most stimulating,\r\nand the most productive in all departments of the vegetable and animal\r\nkingdoms. The Atlantic coast belt, which also has great influence on the\r\neastern districts of the new world and the western districts of the old,\r\ncrosses the great coast belt at almost right angles at the place of its\r\ngreat sundering between Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nIf the contrast between the sea and the land has the effect indicated\r\nabove on the general development of organic life, it must of course\r\nhave great effect also on the life and character of man. Man eminently\r\ndepends upon the conditions amid which his lot is cast. The inhabitant of\r\none of the Pacific islands dwelt in a world whose utmost possibilities\r\nto him lay in the adjacent islands within view, and which his canoe\r\ncould reach in a few hours’ sail. The difference in culture between\r\nhim and those whose range of observation has been greater, must be\r\nimmense. The compacted land division of the globe, the solid cluster\r\nof continents, must be the source of stimulus and culture, of which the\r\nisolated inhabitant of the Pacific islands knew nothing, till commerce\r\nhad at length linked the world together. Only with the improvements in\r\nnavigation could civilization reach him. The European had to carry his\r\nculture to the New Zealander, his antipode.\r\n\r\nThe ancients had little suspicion of all this. Yet the contrast between\r\nthe land world and the water world did not escape Strabo’s keen glances,\r\nand he hints at its effects on man. It is glanced at in one passage of\r\nhis 15th Book. He is speaking of the effect of the moist air of India in\r\ncontrast with the dry air of Libya, and shows that he appreciates that\r\nthese are not without their influence on the constitution of the Indian\r\nand of the Ethiopian. “Some,” he says, “rightly ascribe it to the sun,\r\nthat, in the absence of moisture in their air, the rays burn so deeply\r\ninto the body of the African; the Indian, on the other hand, is not jet\r\nblack and curly-haired, because, in his country, he enjoys the moisture\r\nin the atmosphere.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Position of the Continents and its Influence on the Course of History.\r\n\r\nBesides the three great forms spoken of above—the compacted land-mass,\r\nthe great water-mass, and the subordinate water-mass—the position of the\r\ncontinents leads us to another discovery of prime importance.\r\n\r\nThe question arises, What relation have the continents, taken separately,\r\nto the entire mass which they constitute? What relation do they bear\r\nto each other? What influence does the proximity of great land forms\r\nexercise? What influence their remoteness from each other? Is the\r\narrangement of the continents fortuitous, or adapted to great ends\r\nalways held in view by the Creator? Has Nature been left in this to a\r\nwild, passionate caprice, or has she been subjected to law, and been\r\ncompelled to subserve the interests of humanity? And is it not worthy of\r\nstudy, worthy of science, to investigate these things, to master their\r\nlaw, and observe here the workings of the Divine Mind?\r\n\r\nIn the solar system, we have for a long time minutely studied matters of\r\nsize and distance, the approach and receding of planets, and observed\r\nthe effects of all these things with an accuracy which could not be too\r\nthorough. In the study of our Earth, this has been neglected, because\r\nheretofore those great tracts of land and water have seemed of little\r\nmutual influence; because they are fixed forms. Yet they have a greater\r\ninfluence, perhaps, on this very account. Although there is in them no\r\nlaw of gravitation to study, yet there is in them the display of forces\r\nno less surprising than those of attraction, and which are to be read in\r\nthe light, not of mathematics, but in the light of history. It indeed\r\nseems self-evident that a grouping of these great forms cannot be without\r\nan influence on the progression or retarded development of nations; on\r\nthe amount of population, the progress of colonization, and the union of\r\nStates in offensive and defensive alliance. Should a higher Power throw\r\nthe continents out of their present position and relation to each other,\r\na new history of the world would date from this day.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is the primary element of history; the laws of continental\r\narrangement are the starting-point. Mathematics has thrown a network of\r\nmeridians and parallels over the surface of the globe; but these lines\r\nexercise little influence over the course of history. The symmetry and\r\nregularity which they suggest do not belong to the earth; the earth is\r\nnot bounded, like a crystal, by right lines. There is a freer play than\r\nthat mathematical mark of parallels and meridians suggests; there is\r\nan interdependence of the great land districts of the globe that these\r\nregular lines do not indicate; a higher law of order, evolving the most\r\nperfect results from elements seemingly the most discordant.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pyramidal Forms of the Great Land-masses, and their Southward\r\nDirection toward the Oceanic Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe great land-mass of the globe accumulates in size as we advance toward\r\nthe North Pole. South of 55° S. lat., the continental form disappears,\r\nand the tracts discovered of late years in the neighborhood of the South\r\nPole are apparently islands, or rather long ice-coasts, whose continental\r\nform is very doubtful. The great land division, embracing both the\r\nold and the new worlds, reaches to about 80° N. lat., and the extreme\r\npoints come even yet nearer to the Pole. The distances of one body from\r\nanother, as, for instance, from Greenland to Iceland, are very small, in\r\ncomparison with the immense spaces which divide the southern points of\r\nthe continent, where the hundreds of miles of separation at the north\r\nexpand into thousands. Expansion of the land-mass is the law at the\r\nnorth, contraction at the south. The great land formations terminate in\r\nwedge-shaped extremities, a fact observed by Lord Bacon, J. R. Forster,\r\nand Steffens; America ending at Cape Horn, 55° S. lat., Australia, which\r\nmay be considered to embrace Tasmania or Van Diemen’s Land, at the\r\nsouthern extremity of the latter, 45°, and Africa, at the Cape of Good\r\nHope, 35° S. lat., respectively. Humboldt gave the name of “Pyramidal\r\nStructure” to this cone-shaped form of the great land-mass, which, it\r\nwill be observed, all are directed toward the south. This pyramidal\r\nstructure contributes very much, unquestionably, to the diminished heat\r\nof the southern hemisphere, and has given a great predominance to the\r\npopulation of the northern in comparison with the southern; and not in\r\nrespect to number alone, but also to mental and moral force of character.\r\n\r\nBut not the southern extremities alone of the continents exhibit this\r\nwedge-like form; it is repeated also in the northern countries of Europe\r\nand Asia. In Europe we discover the working of the law in the peninsulas\r\nof Spain, Italy, Greece, the Morea, and the Crimea, and also in the\r\ngreat Scandinavian peninsula. The same phenomenon is repeated on a scale\r\nfar more imposing in Asia, in the great countries of Arabia, India, and\r\nFarther India, Corea, and Kamtchatka; also in both halves of America.\r\nExceptions are rare. In Great Britain, the pointed extremity is toward\r\nthe north, and the greatest breadth at the south; but this is a peculiar\r\ncase, and has its exceptional causes; and perhaps with reason, for this\r\nisland has hitherto maintained an individual and exceptional character in\r\nthe development of modern civilization.\r\n\r\nVarious explanations have been offered for the almost star-shaped\r\nfigure which the combined body of great peninsulas assume, radiating,\r\nas it were, from the center of the land hemisphere. This is seen very\r\nstrikingly in looking at a horizontal projection of the northern\r\nhemisphere, viewed from the North Pole. There has been evidently the\r\nworking out of some great design in this, and the forces employed\r\nmust have been of the first order of magnitude. Clöden attributes it\r\nto the rotation of the earth in its plastic, formative-state. Link\r\nascribes it to electrical forces, generated at the time the earth’s\r\ncrust was hardening into its present consistency. J. R. Forster finds\r\nan explanation in the theory, that formerly great currents, now not\r\nexisting, passed, or sought to pass, from south to north or northwest.\r\nHe attributes to these the parallelism of the great gulfs which indent\r\nthe coast-line of the old world, the uniform abruptness of the shores at\r\nthe south, and the gradual widening of all the great land-masses as we go\r\nnorth. The Atlantic is a channel cleft by those great currents. Behring’s\r\nStraits is a smaller one; but everywhere else the effort was incomplete,\r\nand no opening was effected, except in the straits of minor importance,\r\nwhich separate island from island, or from the main land. The fossils\r\ndiscovered by Pallas seemed to favor this theory, but later investigation\r\nhas showed that they do not.\r\n\r\nLink overthrew Forster’s theory, yet the phenomenon is worthy of study.\r\nViewed on a map of the land hemisphere, constructed according to\r\nMercator’s projection, it is a storehouse of interesting observations and\r\nstudies, and is to be recommended to the student’s careful attention. We\r\nmust pass over the theories; scholars disagree as to the cause; Pisis\r\nascribes it to a hidden law of geometric construction; Necker, Brewster,\r\nand Dana, to magnetism. We must simply accept the facts for the present.\r\n\r\nA careful study of the land surface of the globe suggests interesting\r\ncomparisons with what we know of the heavenly bodies, Jupiter, for\r\nexample, and our moon. Unquestionably, the entirely different grouping\r\nof what seem to be the great features of that luminary must have had an\r\ninfluence on the whole course of history there. We will not enter into\r\nspeculations regarding this, however, referring the reader rather to the\r\nthorough investigations of Beer and Mädler.\r\n\r\n\r\nSituation of the Continents in their Relation to Each Other and to their\r\nCollective Whole.\r\n\r\nThe relation which the continents bear to each other arises, primarily,\r\nfrom their position in reference to the cardinal points of the compass.\r\nThis has been a principle from the earliest times, and the great laws\r\nof population may, in their working, be referred to this simple law of\r\ngrouping.\r\n\r\nAsia was known as the Orient, or, in the apt and beautiful German phrase,\r\nthe Morgenland, or Land of the morning; Europe and the northern rim of\r\nAfrica, as the Occident, or, in the German, the Abendland, or Land of\r\nthe evening. In the south lay the torrid regions of the Ethiopians, in\r\nthe chill north the country of the Hyperboreans. This fourfold division\r\nof the earth was for many centuries the only one known; the division\r\ninto continents being made, according to Herodotus, by the Phenicians.\r\nAnd in very truth, a great principle lay in that rude and primitive\r\ndivision; it was in entire harmony with nature, and, up to the latest\r\ntimes and the opening of a new world, in entire harmony with history\r\nalso. With Asia, the Orient, is connected indissolubly the development of\r\nthe ancient world; with Europe, that of the modern. The contrast between\r\nthese two great divisions is wonderfully analogous to that of morning\r\nand evening. The whole culture of the West had its root, its beginnings\r\nat the East. The East is not merely the place where the sun begins his\r\ndaily course; it is the cradle of man, of nations, of dynasties of every\r\nsort, in politics, religion, and science. All the old royal houses came\r\ninto Europe from the East; they are all “children of the sun,” no less\r\nthan the princely families of India and Persia. The West merely witnesses\r\nthe progress of what was begun in the East. From the most ancient times\r\nonward through the Middle Ages,—from Homer to Dante’s “Purgatorio,”—the\r\nWest is associated with the kingdom of the dead, with “Hades,” and\r\nthe “islands of the blest.” And within these two great divisions of\r\nOrient and Occident are comprised smaller ones, adapted to more limited\r\nconceptions of the extent of the earth, but growing out of the same root\r\nwith the larger division. Bactriana and India constituted the Orient to\r\nthe inhabitants of Western Asia, Syria their Occident; Asia Minor was the\r\nOrient of the Greeks, Italy and Sicily their Hesperia; while the Romans\r\ncalled Spain theirs.\r\n\r\nBetween the Orient and Occident, and yet to the south of both, lay the\r\nLibya of the ancients, exposed to the sun’s direct rays. In the very\r\nmiddle of the earth, on both sides of the equator, and not at the South\r\nPole, is the true South. There we must seek the phenomena of the tropical\r\nworld in their culminations. As high noon, the middle point in the hour,\r\nis the consummation of the day, so the torrid climes of the equatorial\r\nbelt, at the very middle of the earth, afford the extremes of luxuriant\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nThe broad tracts of land at the northern polar regions formed the true\r\nphysical contrast to the Orient and the Occident, as well as to the great\r\nSouth of central Africa. They lay around the North Pole like a vast\r\nshield of earth, unbroken except by the comparatively insignificant seas\r\nand gulfs of that region. And even where the water has broken its way and\r\nsevered those northern lands, a submarine volcanic activity is, even now,\r\nconstantly at work to restore the break, and bind the coasts together.\r\nAt about 70° N. lat., all the countries of the north are brought into\r\ngreat nearness, and that parallel is a highway of little else than land\r\ncrossing the North Cape of Europe, Cape Chelagskoy, in Tchooktchee, at\r\nthe northeastern extremity of Asia, and touching Cape Bathurst, and the\r\nFury and Heckla Straits of North America. North of this highway and of\r\nthe Georgian Archipelago begins the great group of circum-polar islands.\r\n\r\nThe break between Asia and North America, at Behring’s Straits, is but\r\nfifty-six miles wide; it is the mere outlet of the Sea of Kamtckatka into\r\nthe Arctic Ocean. The space between the northeast of America and the\r\nnorthwest of Europe is much greater indeed, but, in comparison with the\r\ndistance between the southernmost points of the old and the new world,\r\ninsignificant. The distance from northern Norway to Greenland is but\r\nabout 940 miles.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that, at the north of the great continental land-mass,\r\nwhere minor seas and channels break through, great volcanic forces are\r\nconstantly at work, as hinted at above, to restore the unity. In the Sea\r\nof Kamtchatka lie the Aleutian islands, extending more than 950 miles,\r\nand forming what has been happily termed a bridge from the old world\r\nto the new. It consists of more than a hundred rocks and islands, some\r\nof which have been thrown up within the memory of man. In 1806, von\r\nLangsdorf and Tilesius witnessed the emergence of one of these, with a\r\ncone-shaped center, and about twenty miles in circumference. Grewingk has\r\ncounted more than fifty volcanoes in activity within the limits of this\r\nisland chain. The Curile islands, more to the south, form another similar\r\nvolcanic group, extending from Japan to Kamtchatka. In this range there\r\nare known to be at least ten volcanoes, 10,000 feet in height.\r\n\r\nThe same high degree of volcanic activity must have formerly existed\r\nbetween Europe and America, for the traces of it are still visible. And\r\nnot the traces alone, but a part of the same activity. And doubtless\r\nthe shallowness of the waters between those continents hints at the\r\nsame. More accurate explorations, then, will probably reveal multitudes\r\nof mountains, thrown up by these submarine forces, but not far enough\r\nto emerge and bear the name of islands. Yet many have emerged—those\r\nwhich fringe the shores of Norway, Scotland, and Ireland; the Orkneys,\r\nShetland, and Hebrides islands; the Färoe group, with their blistered\r\nsurface, their recesses, and volcanic rocks; Iceland, with its hot\r\nsprings; and Mount Heckla; Jan Mayen, with its frightful craters, and\r\nthe eastern coast of Greenland; one island, Sabrina, in the midst of the\r\nAzore group; which has had three upheavals within two hundred years,\r\nin 1638, 1723, and 1811,—all these plainly indicate the presence of\r\ntremendous forces, active in the past as well as in the present.\r\n\r\nWe thus fix the character of the arctic polar lands to be a close\r\ndrawing together. Europe has, fortunately for itself, the least share in\r\nthose inhospitable regions; only her pointed northern shores fringe the\r\nshores of the polar sea, leaving the great bulk of the great land-mass\r\nof the north to the broad shores of Asia and North America, with their\r\nneighboring island groups.\r\n\r\nThis polar world, as we may call it, in contradistinction to the\r\nOrient and the Occident, is not separated from more southerly regions\r\nby any great physical line of demarkation. The arctic circle is a\r\nmere mathematical line 66½° N. lat.; it has no geographical character\r\nwhatever. The true polar world reaches in some places far beyond this\r\nmathematical barrier, bringing all its characteristics with it; while,\r\non the other hand, it withdraws, at a few other places, nearer to the\r\nPole. Were the polar world more broken up than it is by inland seas, and\r\nseparated from the great land-mass by broad channels, it would be far\r\nmore isolated in its whole character than it is. It is this immediate\r\ncontiguity of the polar world with the great land-mass which opens it\r\nto whatever civilization it may be able to receive. And there is the\r\nsame unity in the polar world that there is in the tropical world. The\r\nsame phenomena which appear in one part of it are repeated in every\r\nother part. There are, of course, subordinate modifications found, but\r\neverything essential, which is discovered in one part, is discovered in\r\nevery other part. There is no distinction into “new world” and no “old\r\nworld;” the new world and the old coincide amid the arctic pole.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic of the polar world, next to this of unbrokenness, is\r\nthe simplicity, or what might be called the monotony of its productions\r\nand all its features; the uniform reproduction of the same plants and\r\nanimals, as well as of geological forms. Even Lapland, which is the\r\nfarthest removed from the Pole of all the arctic regions, manifests,\r\nin its rounded and polished granite and gneiss and its deep and\r\nsharply-defined cuts, the same uniformity. The syenite found at Lake\r\nImandra displays the same characteristics as that found on the islands in\r\nthe White Sea, and on the shores of Greenland. The tops of the mountains,\r\ninstead of being green, are all white with the lichen, commonly known as\r\nreindeer moss. And as with the geological formations and the vegetable\r\nkingdoms, so with the animal kingdom. Elsewhere are found bears, foxes,\r\nreindeer, seals, and walruses; the feathered tribes partake of the\r\ngeneral monotony of structure, and man not less. The range of his\r\ndevelopment is extremely limited, and his character little different,\r\nwhether in northern Asia or northern America.\r\n\r\nAmerica forms the real West of the great land-mass, the true Occident\r\nof the earth, young as yet, but to receive as its gift the entire\r\nculture of the East, and to advance by giant steps to a position of\r\nindependent influence. Already it has far surpassed Asia in industry\r\nand civilization. The old world was the preparation for the new. Almost\r\neverything which the new world enjoys and values was the gift of the old.\r\nIts most ancient monuments of religion, architecture, and art are closely\r\nlinked to those of the old world. Hieroglyphics have been found among\r\nthe Peruvians and the Mexicans. In like manner embalming of princes, the\r\nengraving of astronomical data upon rocks, were borrowed from the East.\r\n\r\nThe _historic_ character of America is more striking in respect to\r\nnewness than the physical features of the water hemisphere. Buffon\r\nsupposed that the American continent is of more recent formation than\r\nthe old world, assigning for his opinion that it is more submerged,\r\nbecause smaller in area, than the eastern land-mass; because, also, the\r\nplants which demand moisture are predominant over those which depend on\r\na dry climate; and because the forms of homologous animals—the elephant,\r\nrhinoceros, crocodile, turtle, apes, and serpents, for instance—do not\r\nattain the same size as in Asia and Africa. But waiving this, we use the\r\nname New World, only with significance in its connection with history.\r\n\r\nWith the discovery of America begins a new period in the history of man\r\nand of nations in their civil relations. The enlargement of territory\r\noccasioned by it was not greater than the enlargement of the bounds of\r\nthought. The old world had been developed earliest, had gone as far\r\nas it could go; it had to wait till another great step should be taken\r\nbefore it could go on in its course. The highest progress of the human\r\nrace, the complete development of its possibilities, was not possible\r\ntill man should, in his wanderings from east to west, compass the globe,\r\nand take possession of it, not for a day, but for all time. The primitive\r\nsettlements in Mexico, Peru, and Yucatan could not sustain themselves in\r\nconsequence of their isolation; navigation was in its rudest stages, and\r\nit needed to be in its highest before the world should be bound together\r\nclosely enough to advance in all its parts toward the goal of a perfect\r\ncivilization. Those primitive colonies perished therefore, as Canaan\r\nperished before Israel, and were replaced by others. The reason of this\r\nlay in the isolation of the land-masses of the earth. Had America been\r\ndiscovered and made accessible to the old world before the diffusion of\r\nthe Gospel and the establishment of the Christian Church, it would have\r\nbeen too early, and heathenism might have had its grandest triumph and\r\nits loftiest temples in the new world. The way was not open as yet for\r\nthe high moral development of the race; and the highways of civilization\r\nwere not made till the most modern times, when all was in readiness for\r\nthe great advance which we are witnessing now.\r\n\r\nThe contrast to the great continental hemisphere is found in Australia,\r\na land-mass of no insignificant size, situated at the center, or very\r\nnearly at the center of the great oceanic hemisphere, and surrounded by\r\nhundreds of groups of islands, generally of quite unimportant magnitude.\r\nThe name Australia was fitly chosen; it indicates its true relations\r\nto the Southern or Austral ocean. As Africa is the true South to the\r\neastern hemisphere, Australia is the true South to the great continental\r\nland-mass of the whole globe. As the earth has two magnetic north poles,\r\nand two north poles of cold, one of the former in Siberia, north of Lake\r\nBaikal, and east of Cape Taimura, 110° east of Greenwich; the other\r\nin the neighborhood of Melville Island, in North America, 102° west\r\nlongitude from Greenwich, so there are, in a physical sense, two south\r\npoles, (we do not refer to the magnetic ones and the poles of cold,) a\r\ncontinental south pole in Africa, a marine or maritime south pole in\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nThis country, the largest of islands or the smallest of continents as we\r\nmay choose to designate it, the most remote of all the great divisions\r\nfrom the center of the land hemisphere, has been the last to feel the\r\npulses of civilization. There, therefore, is to-day the most rapid, the\r\nmost amazing advancement to be witnessed on the earth; it has crowded\r\ncenturies into decades, and with its shores adorned even now, in its\r\nyouth, with states and cities, it cannot longer be called a land left\r\nbehind in the world’s advance. It has inherited all that was finished in\r\nthe knowledge and culture of the continental world; what the people of\r\nthat world have toiled for years to win, becomes at once the birthright\r\nof the Australians. It is only an instance of the truth of Humboldt’s\r\nremark, that the more full the world is of ideas, the more rapid is its\r\nprogress—a remark which throws the strongest light upon the connection of\r\ngeography with history.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Historical Element in Geographical Science.\r\n\r\nWhile so many a spot in the great continental land-mass was once the\r\nhome of a high culture, and from being a cradle of arts and sciences\r\nhas become a deserted waste, the civil and political condition of many\r\npeople in the remote districts on the oceanic side of the globe has\r\nadvanced with unprecedented rapidity. The course of development has been\r\nvery different from what it was formerly. Distances, natural influences,\r\nnatural productions even, yield always to the victorious march of man,\r\nand disappear before his tread; or, in other words, the human race is\r\nmore and more freed from the forces of nature; man is more and more\r\ndisenthralled from the dominion of the earth which he inhabits. The\r\nhistory of specific districts and of entire continents confirms this.\r\n\r\nThe first inhabitant of the sandy valley of the Nile was a dweller in a\r\nwaste, as the nomadic Arab is to-day. But the later and more cultivated\r\nEgyptians transformed that waste, through the agency of irrigation and\r\ncanals, into the most fruitful garden of the world. They not only rose\r\nthemselves, but raised their own country, hitherto so sterile, into a\r\nplace of the first importance, and did it by the simplest of means,—the\r\nbringing the water and the land into more intimate relations. Through\r\nneglect and the tyranny of successive kings, the fruitful valley sank\r\nagain into its waste condition. The district around Thebes became a\r\ndesert, the fruitful Mareotis a swamp; similar phenomena occurred in many\r\nparts of Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nAnother example of man’s subjugation of nature is found in great mountain\r\nchains. During the first centuries after Christ, the cultivated south of\r\nEurope was separated from the uncultivated Celtic and Teutonic north by\r\na great natural barrier, the unbroken, untraversed Alpine chain, which\r\npassed through all central Europe from west to east. At the south lay the\r\nrich states of the old world, beyond the Alps was the cold and barren\r\nnorth. But this old formidable barrier has vanished, as the thronged\r\ncantons of Switzerland and the crowded villages of the Tyrol yearly\r\nbear witness; and they draw thousands of tourists instead of repelling\r\nthem. What a mighty change! From Provence to Styria run the stately forms\r\nof the Alpine chain; but the deep recesses and the lofty highlands are\r\nthickly peopled, the forests are thinned, the obstructing rocks removed.\r\nNo longer a barrier between the north and the south, as it was in the\r\ntime of Julius and Augustus Cæsar, Switzerland has become a country\r\nof stupendous highways. The peaks which were once unapproachable, and\r\naround which merely eagles idly flew, are now the passes of Mount Cenis,\r\nthe Simplon, Saint Gothard, the Splügen, and Saint Bernard; while the\r\nsnowy heights of Ortler, in eastern Alps, now give place to a public\r\nroad. Over the Semmering Alp a railway even passes. Just as the wild\r\nhorse of Toorkistan has given up his freedom and has become the tame and\r\nuseful servant of civilization, so this Alpine segment of the globe has\r\nchanged all its relations to the adjacent countries. The influence of\r\nthe most stupendous natural objects is weakened every year. The physical\r\ndimensions may and do remain unchanged, but their influence on life\r\nand on history is undermined by those new conditions which operate so\r\npowerfully in freeing man from the dominion of nature. The power of man\r\nmakes him master of the earth, and gives even the key to the subjection\r\nof the grandest mountain chains into his hands.\r\n\r\nIn further illustration of this, take the Ural chain, which was and still\r\nis the eastern division line of one continent, and the western barrier\r\nof another, but which has become, since the days of Peter the Great, a\r\ngrand center of labor and commerce, a great avenue of civilization in\r\nits return passage from Europe to Asia. And so everywhere, from the wild\r\nCaucasus and the Himalayas to the grand Cordilleras of America, the same\r\nprogress is seen; man becomes more and more the conqueror over nature.\r\nAnd not in mountains alone, but in the great forest regions of central\r\nEurope, in the primitive wilderness of North America, and in the marshes\r\nof the Netherlands, does man vanquish the forces which once fettered him.\r\nThe once fearful wastes of Sahara have become the track of caravans; the\r\nsterile plains of Australia and California have drawn great colonies to\r\ntheir gold mines; the ice seas at the north have become, through the\r\nefforts of Parry, Franklin, and others, the scene of heroic exploits and\r\nof grand struggles of man with nature; indeed, the greatest victories of\r\nmodern civilization have been there, and the playgrounds of polar bears\r\nand walruses have witnessed the noblest humanities, and the loftiest\r\ncourage, and the most disinterested heroism of the age.\r\n\r\nThe continents and oceans have witnessed still greater transformations.\r\nThe seas were once the impassable barriers of nations. The birds of the\r\nair only traversed the great distances which separated shore from shore.\r\nThe metallic stores of the earth, the vegetable and animal kingdoms\r\nwere not transferred to any extent from place to place; the sea brought\r\nnothing from lands remotely foreign but drift-sand, cocoa-nuts, floating\r\nwood, ice masses, and seaweed, swept by the great currents from shore\r\nto shore. But now the seas are no barriers; they do not separate the\r\ncontinents but bind them together, and unite the destinies of nations\r\nin the closest manner. The great improvements in ocean navigation have\r\nentirely changed the relations of the entire globe. The isolated island\r\nof St. Helena, which was for centuries at the very confines of the\r\nknown world, became, within the second decade of the present century, a\r\nprison-house for the great European robber, and lay guarded under the\r\neye of Europe. The Cape of Good Hope, which was for centuries the limit\r\nof Portuguese navigation, has become a mere halting-place for sailing\r\nships and steamers. The voyage from England to China has been narrowed,\r\nwithin one hundred years, from an eight months’ to a four months’ sail.\r\nThese great changes have been mainly effected by the agency of steam.\r\nSteam has transformed the smaller seas into mere bridges, and England\r\nand France are securely joined, Marseilles and Algiers; while Prussian\r\nStettin is brought into proximity with Swedish Stockholm and Russian\r\nPetersburg. The voyage to America, that remote land, which before the\r\ndays of Columbus was as inaccessible as the moon, was made by him in\r\nseventy days, but is now accomplished in ten. Even Australia cannot be\r\nsaid to be distant; a steamer needs but seventy-five days to reach it,\r\nand ten of those are consumed on the Isthmus of Suez. No island now lies\r\nbeyond the world of commerce. The most active traffic exists between\r\nplaces the most remote. The wool and the wheat of Australia control the\r\nprice of those commodities in London, and the value of cotton in America\r\nfixes that of woven goods and even of bread in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe great rivers too have been curtailed of their relative importance,\r\nand have been shortened by steam sixfold. They can be stemmed too, which\r\nis an immense gain, for in the primitive stages of navigation they\r\ncould only be sailed upon downward, from source to mouth. In 1854, four\r\nhundred steamers traversed the Mississippi and its branches, and came\r\ninto contact with a region one-third as large as Europe. The Indus,\r\nGanges, Irrawaddy, Nile, La Plata, and even the Amazon, the monarch of\r\nrivers, which drains a country half as large as Europe, are now more or\r\nless open to steam navigation. The great river systems of central Europe\r\ntoo are thoroughly navigated; and Southern Germany, Trebizond, Mayence,\r\nCologne, and London may be grouped as neighbors. The land-locked seas are\r\nreduced to insignificance, and their shores are now covered with villages\r\nand cities, from the Platten-See of Hungary up to the Caspian and the\r\ngreat lakes of North America.\r\n\r\nTo sum all up in one word, the mighty influence of Time on the\r\ngeographical development of the earth is displayed in the clearest\r\nmanner. But this influence is not the same for all localities on the\r\nglobe. While there are some people and some places which are left behind,\r\nthere are others which have made wonderful progress, and have taken\r\nand now hold a foremost place. And such a position is that of Europe\r\nat the present moment. Europe, the most central of all continents, in\r\nrelation to the great land-mass of the earth, and also the one most\r\nequally removed from the middle point of the great water-mass, touches\r\nthe whole remaining world at the greatest number of points, and this, in\r\nconjunction with her remarkably broken coast-line, so favorable to the\r\npurposes of navigation, have given her her place of command, and have\r\nassigned to England her evident role of mistress of the seas.\r\n\r\nAnd looking from the present to the past, we see that as some great\r\ntribes of men have given the whole fruits of their natural existence\r\nto the world for its future use, so some places, and those of no\r\ninsignificant size sometimes, have conferred upon the world, the trust\r\nwhich they once held, and now recede, as it were, from view. They\r\nwere great in the past, and the results of their greatness are now\r\nincorporated in the world’s life. The earth is one; and through the\r\nagency of what we may call either time or history, all its parts are in\r\nceaseless action and reaction on each other. Though some great districts\r\nseem now to have no part to play, the element of time draws them into the\r\ngreat cosmos; they once had a great share in the world’s affairs, and\r\nthe fruits which they brought to completion are merely in other hands.\r\nThe earth is, therefore, as was stated in the introduction, a unit, an\r\norganism of itself: it has its own law of development, its own cosmical\r\nlife; it can be studied in no one of its parts and at no special epoch\r\nof its history. The past and the future, the near and the remote, are\r\nall blended in a system of mutual interdependence, and must be looked at\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThis is shown clearly in the past of Asia, and the present of Europe and\r\nsome parts of the new world, while the history of all central Africa\r\nseems to lie wholly in the future. Heretofore it has enjoyed no progress\r\nexcepting along its northern rim. The middle portion of the old world\r\nhas outlived its primitive ethnographical impulse, and sunk back into a\r\nstate of slumberous inaction. Asia, to call this region by its recognized\r\nname, has projected its own life from the center to the circumference;\r\nby this I mean, that while it seems to be exhausted of its old vigor,\r\nother countries inherited its power. The population of Asia is much less\r\nthan it was in the time of Alexander the Great, much less than during\r\nthe Mohammedan and Mongolian conquests, when all the habitable parts of\r\nthat immense continent were bound together by highways of commerce and\r\ntravel. On the other hand, the coasts are now of much more value and\r\nsignificance than they were in ancient times, and navigation has dotted\r\nher sea outline with splendid and populous cities. These seem, by reason\r\nof the facilities which steam affords, to be brought near to Europe;\r\nwhile the natives who inhabit central Asia are not only widely separated\r\nfrom the civilized world, but are divided up and set against each other\r\nby religious and political enmities of the most bitter kind. This is\r\ndisplayed in its fullest force by the comparative inapproachability of\r\nthe great mountain chains, the Ural, the Taurus, and the Caucasus, and\r\nyet more by the unchanged barbarism of the central tribes, the hostile\r\npolitical relations, lacking all of the amenities and mutual dependencies\r\nof European policy, and the deadly antagonism of Mohammedanism and\r\nChristianity. This last is the curse which the natives of the earth have\r\nbrought upon themselves. It is the clashing of religious faiths which has\r\nput the extinguisher on Asiatic progress, annihilated her enterprise, and\r\nset her in her present isolation. Still this barrier is not absolutely\r\nsettled and for all time, but already it shows that it is capable of some\r\nmodification. The politico-religious system of the Chinese is rending\r\nunder our eyes; the old bonds which Mohammedanism once laid on Asia are\r\nnow sensibly relaxed. The great highways of travel through the country of\r\nthe Euphrates and Tigris and the extended archæological investigations of\r\nmodern times have operated mediatorially between Europe and Asia; while\r\nsteam navigation on the Danube has brought Turkey, a hitherto undissolved\r\nAsiatic element in European life, into closer relations with the great\r\npowers of the West. The great missionary enterprise, too, of modern\r\ntimes, has been laboring to remould the ideas of the Asiatic nations,\r\nwhile navigation has operated on the material and more appreciable\r\ninterests of commerce and industry.\r\n\r\nThere are no possible limits to be assigned to the perfectibility of the\r\nglobe as the abode of man; no possible bounds to his enterprise. The\r\nconstruction of a canal through the Isthmus of Panama would bring the\r\neastern coast of Asia seven thousand miles nearer than it is now to the\r\nAtlantic shores of America and Europe. By saving the mere doubling of\r\nCape Horn, one-third of the periphery of the globe would be annihilated,\r\nso far as the labor and expense of navigation are concerned. North\r\nAmerica would nearly double its resources when its Atlantic and Pacific\r\ncoasts stand in close connection and interdependence. The projected\r\ncanal at Suez would exercise an unbounded influence over Asia in binding\r\nit anew to Europe. The building of highways through the passes of the\r\nUral, the Caucasus, and Himalayas is yet to be accomplished; and only\r\nnow are great roads constructing over the Rocky Mountains, welding North\r\nAmerica together. The construction of railways on the high plateaus of\r\ncentral Africa will transform that vast undeveloped district, so rich in\r\nresources for the future. The changes which art is yet to effect on our\r\nglobe are beyond all possible computation, and it might be said, beyond\r\nany possible exaggeration.\r\n\r\nWe turn away from these glances into the future to look upon the past,\r\nthe long ages when men lived in rudeness and ignorance, having no art,\r\nand knowing nothing beyond the little tract where they were born, and to\r\nwhich they remained chained. There was no binding of shore to shore, and\r\nof continent to continent, through the mediatorial agency of seas and\r\noceans. And this gave to the continents a far greater individuality than\r\nthey have now, and a much higher degree of apparent influence than now\r\nwhen we cannot view them excepting as parts of the great complex which\r\nforms the world. The wanderings of the old nomadic races, the enlarging\r\nof the domains of culture, the transfer of the natural productions of\r\nall climes, as well as the traditional ideas of all lands, proceeded\r\nfrom the central portions of the ancient world toward the extremities.\r\nThe manner of this progress, following as it does the order of history,\r\ndisplays more clearly than almost anything else the close dependence\r\nof all national development upon geographical conditions, and their\r\nindissoluble connection. Without this connection the order of historical\r\nevents would have been completely changed. In no instance has there been\r\nself-evolved progress in the North, East, South, or West; it uniformly\r\nbegan at the geographical center, at the point of conflict between the\r\nOrient, the Occident, and the tropical South.\r\n\r\nWestern Asia, northern Africa, and southeastern Europe were the homes\r\nof the earliest culture, and it is to them that all other parts of the\r\nworld owe the light which they enjoy, though they may have received\r\nit at second or third hand. The territory of which I speak extended\r\nfrom the highlands of India to Italy, and from the Nile to the Don,\r\nincluding the valleys of the Euphrates and the Gihon. This broad and\r\nfertile reach of territory has been the fruitful mother of the world’s\r\npresent thought and culture. Nor must we overlook the fact that, despite\r\nwhat was said above, regarding the oceans as the greatest barriers to\r\nthe spread of civilization, that smaller seas aided it, for the very\r\ncountry of which I speak was intersected by five important seas, and\r\nto them it is under immeasurable obligations for its development. This\r\nAsiatic-Africo-European belt has exercised the greatest influence on\r\nall the course of human affairs, on all colonization, on the differing\r\nof races and languages, and the arts of war and of peace, over the\r\nhabitable world. This territory lies as the background of all the events\r\nof history, and has given to every one its distinctive character and its\r\nappropriate place. Nor can we in the future dispense with the element\r\ninvolved in this, of historical occurrences yet to come dependent on past\r\ngeographical conditions, although this will be far less marked than it\r\nhas been in the past. It demands and will demand a far larger measure of\r\ninvestigation and thought than it has yet received. Whatever independent\r\nprogress the New World and Australia may seem to be making, and whatever\r\ninterest they may awaken in the minds of students, not even they can be\r\nlooked at without regard to their relations to the ancient historical\r\nlands, the source of all the inherited culture which they are enjoying\r\nin their vigorous youth. India, Egypt, Palestine, Greece, and other\r\ncountries still stand out as the formative lands of all modern history,\r\nand we cannot study the present without studying them. They are to the\r\nstudent what Plutarch’s Lives are to the biographer, the imperishable and\r\nunequaled models which gain new luster as time rolls on. It is therefore\r\nnot without reason that ancient geography ought to be subjected to a\r\nmore systematic treatment than the geography of the Middle Ages. The\r\nlatter, though not unworthy of a large place, had no relations of special\r\nimportance to the whole world, to the study of the physical conditions\r\nof the most imposing objects of nature, to the connection as cause and\r\neffect of events past, present, and to come.\r\n\r\nFrom these foundation principles, we advance to a more full study of the\r\nconfiguration of the surface of the globe, for which we are now in a\r\nmeasure prepared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n\r\nA more extended Investigation regarding the Earth’s Surface.\r\n\r\nIt is the province of Hydrography to deal with the oceanic world;\r\nGeography proper concerns itself simply with solid forms. The Hydrography\r\nof the globe we must pass over, however. Aside from the fact that it\r\nwould lead us into studies of the most protracted nature, it forms\r\nstrictly one department of nautical science. Besides, there is the less\r\noccasion to speak of it here at length, that works of great excellence\r\nhave been published, relating to that branch. We turn therefore to the\r\nland, and shall study the world of waters only so far as it exerts\r\ninfluence on the land.\r\n\r\nBy land we mean the islands as well as the continents, for, as remarked\r\nbefore, the difference between them is merely relative. To the land\r\ndivision of the globe, however, belong all rivers and the internal fresh\r\nwater lakes, however large. The basis of difference does not lie in the\r\nfact that one part of the globe is water, the other part land, but in the\r\nfact that one is a tract of uniform evenness, the other of constantly\r\nvarying surface, the internal rivers and lakes only being frills, so to\r\nspeak, to the elevated region, and not sharing the sea level of the great\r\noceanic mass. Uniformity of surface is then the chief characteristic of\r\nthe sea; a lack of it, of the land. A mathematical level is a thing\r\nunknown on extended districts, and an approximation to it is very rare.\r\nEven the basins of former seas do not display a perfectly level bed. The\r\nplains of North Germany are characterized by this billowy rolling. The\r\nflats along the Danube, in Hungary, and along the Po, in North Italy,\r\nhave really important deviations from a true level, though the eye is\r\nnot able to discern them. Milan is four hundred feet above the Adriatic;\r\nbut the eye does not discern that it is not at the center of a plain as\r\nperfect as the surface of the sea itself, and yet that plain does shelve\r\ngradually away till the Adriatic checks and defines it. Pesth is two\r\nhundred and fifteen feet above the ocean level, yet the gradual decline\r\nto the Black Sea is undiscernible to the eye. The immense plains along\r\nthe Amazon, even the celebrated llanos on the Orinoco, which Alexander\r\nvon Humboldt likens to inland seas of verdure, have a not insignificant\r\nslope from west to east. The middle point of these llanos near the City\r\nof Calabozo, about 100 geographical miles from the sea, he found to be\r\n180 feet above the sea level; far lower indeed than Milan or Pesth,\r\nrelatively, yet at a perceptible elevation. All of these plains were\r\nonce the bottom of the sea; the Adriatic laved the base of the Apennines\r\nand the Cottian Alps, and the Atlantic swept westward over the llanos\r\nof the Orinoco and the Essequibo, having the Sierra de Venezuela on the\r\nnorth and the Sierra Parima on the south, till it was checked by the\r\nCordilleras of Merida and Pamplona.\r\n\r\nDepression and elevation, then, are the characteristics of the land. They\r\nare both measured from the level of the sea; their absolute altitude is\r\nreckoned from the imaginary sea level, extended over the whole globe.\r\nTheir mutual relations to each other are determined from their relative\r\nheights. The absolute elevation above the level of the ocean can be\r\ndetermined in a number of ways. If the heights to be measured are in\r\nthe immediate vicinity of the sea, a simple system of triangulation\r\nwill effect it. If they are removed from the sea, the difficulties are\r\ngreater, and increase according to the distance from the sea. The heights\r\nof great inland mountains are determined by complicated operations with\r\nthe spirit-level, protracted trigonometrical calculations, the unwearied\r\nand skillful use of the barometer, and constant appeal to the boiling\r\npoint of water. The description of these methods falls within the\r\nprovince of Physics.\r\n\r\nAs the determination of the heights of the loftiest mountains could not\r\nbe made before the appointments of scientific explorers have attained\r\nto a certain degree of accuracy and delicacy, the knowledge of them in\r\nformer times was almost wholly relative. The inquiries of La Condamine,\r\nSaussure, and de Luc, in the Andes and the Swiss Alps, are almost\r\nthe only ones to be trusted among those of the older observers. All\r\nunscientific travelers without accurate instruments confounded absolute\r\nheights with relative heights, and innumerable errors crept therefore\r\ninto the earlier text-books. It is only within the most recent times that\r\nHypsometry has attained to the dignity of a science.\r\n\r\nTo meet and counteract the errors alluded to above, and current in\r\nthe loose language of popular speech, we shall use a new and indeed\r\narbitrary terminology,—arbitrary because the data which mensuration\r\nwill sometimes furnish are now, in part, wanting. We will divide the\r\nearth not relatively, but absolutely, into highlands and lowlands. The\r\ngreat districts often met, whose elevations are very moderate, we call\r\nlowlands. They are, for the most part, immense plains, varied but little\r\nabove the level of the sea. The great districts which inclose mountain\r\nranges we call highlands, and sometimes plateaus. True highlands can\r\noften embrace very extended and elevated plains, and these plains again\r\nmay include hills and mountains. This does not affect their character\r\nas highlands, which lies in the fact of elevation rather than in more\r\nor less modified variation of surface. There may be vast variety in the\r\nphysical manifestations of a great plateau district, entirely independent\r\nof the relative effects produced by the distribution of its surface into\r\nplains, rolling land, hills, and mountains.\r\n\r\nIn the lowlands there may exist hills to some extent, and these may even\r\nbe combined in ranges, provided only that they do not violate the uniform\r\ncharacteristics of the district in which they are found.\r\n\r\nThe highlands are generally met with in the interior of the continents;\r\nthe lowlands at the coasts. Yet there are exceptions to this.\r\n\r\nIn the transitions from lowlands to highlands there is great diversity.\r\nWe can speak of three distinct bases of discrimination: a sudden\r\nand abrupt ascent; a rise in elevation so gradual as scarcely to be\r\nperceived; and a terrace formation. Yet in these there is a blending of\r\none variety with another; there is no place sharply marked, where we can\r\nsay that one form ends and another begins. There are constantly found\r\nmodifications of these three transitional phases. The plains along the\r\nIndus and the Ganges rise sharply to the plateaus of Thibet The flat\r\nPacific coast of South America is exchanged with equal abruptness for\r\nthe highlands of Peru. The transition is a gradual one from the lowlands\r\nof North Germany, along the Baltic and the North Sea, through Saxony\r\nand Bohemia to the Bavarian highlands, north of the Alps. The Spanish\r\nhighlands form a series of terraces, increasing in height from south to\r\nnorth. The immense plateaus of central Asia are also terrace formations,\r\nof diminishing elevation, as they advance to Siberia; so, too, are the\r\neastern plateaus of Peru, falling off in altitude toward the plains of\r\nthe Amazon.\r\n\r\nJust as varied are the heights taken from the sea level of the leading\r\nplateaus. Yet they never rise to a point of elevation comparable\r\nwith those of isolated mountain peaks or ranges. These attain, in no\r\ninsignificant numbers, the height of 24,000 feet, while some ascend\r\nthousands of feet beyond that. In Mount Everest, of the Himalaya chain,\r\nthe loftiest summit yet measured (29,000 feet) is found; although it may\r\nbe that future investigations more to the south will disclose yet greater\r\nheights.\r\n\r\n\r\nHighlands.\r\n\r\nContinuous highlands or plateaus seldom attain an elevation greater\r\nthan a half or a third of the loftiest mountains; the most elevated\r\nrange in altitude, from 8000 to 12,000 feet above the sea level. On an\r\naverage, they lie about 4000 to 5000 feet above the sea. We take the last\r\nheight as a convenient point of demarkation between the two classes of\r\nhighlands—those of the first and those of the second magnitude. It is an\r\narbitrary point, of course, and the division there must remain, without\r\na natural base to rest upon, till more results in Hypsometry shall have\r\ndetermined the real point of average between the combined lowlands and\r\nthe combined highlands of the earth’s surface. Meantime this division\r\nwill be of great service to us in enabling us to bring into a definite\r\nand appreciable classification many facts which would otherwise not be so\r\nwell understood in their relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Highlands or Plateaus of the First Class._\r\n\r\nBy plateaus of the first class, we mean those high, continuous plains\r\nwhich lie at the elevation of more than from 4000 to 5000 feet above\r\nthe sea level. The extreme height to which such plateaus rise is a fact\r\nyet to be ascertained. At an elevation of from 4000 to 5000 feet the\r\nhighlands of the first class merge into those of the second. The point of\r\ntransition is, of course, very difficult to fix with precision.\r\n\r\nThe high plateaus of Asia rise more than 14,000 feet. They inclose the\r\nhead-waters of the Ganges and the Indus. All central Asia is a vast\r\ncongeries of highlands; but, as a body, they by no means belong to\r\nthe most elevated of the globe. They are colossal in their length and\r\nbreadth, but not in their uniform altitude. In the latter respect, they\r\nare far more varied than is generally supposed.\r\n\r\nThe plateau of Thibet attains, in its whole great extent of 1800 miles\r\nin length and 500 miles in breadth, an average elevation of 10,800\r\nfeet above the sea level. In some cases it rises, of course, much\r\nhigher, as, near the holy lake Manasarowar, for instance, where it is\r\n14,000 feet above the sea. Others sink, as at Ladakh, in Little Thibet,\r\nto an altitude of about 9000 feet; so, too, Gertope, in the region\r\nremarkable for its goats and the rich shawls manufactured there, and\r\nShiffke, are about 9804 feet above the sea. The plateau of Great Thibet,\r\neast of Lassa, the capital, and north of the Upper Brahmapootra or\r\nYam-Dzangbotscha, is 9000 feet in elevation. There are also districts\r\nfilled with mountain groups of great heights, but where the depressions\r\nsink to the level of the valleys of the Indus, Sutlej, Brahmapootra, as\r\nlow indeed as 5460 feet, as at Cashmere, so that there is no lack of\r\ndiversity in the great plateau of Thibet.\r\n\r\nThe plateau of Mongolia, or more exactly the desert of Gobi, can be\r\nranked only on its lower edges, where it touches the Chinese frontier, as\r\nof the first class, although in extent it is twice as large as the great\r\nplateau of Thibet. Only near the north bend of the Hoang-Ho and near\r\nPeking does it reach an altitude of 8000 feet, and gradually sinks away\r\nas it advances toward the northern frontier of the Chinese territory,\r\nto 5100 feet, and farther north to 4000 feet; in the middle portions of\r\nthe great table-land it is depressed to a height of 2400 to 3600 feet;\r\nit rises again at the head-waters of the Orkhon and the Toola to an\r\nelevation of 4620 feet, and falls off in terraces toward Kiakhta, near\r\nthe northern boundary, where it is 1330 feet high, Selenghinsk, on the\r\nSelenga, where it is 1632 feet high, and Berch-Udaisk, where it is 1458\r\nfeet high, till it reaches Lake Baikal, 1332 feet above the sea level\r\naccording to Humboldt, though Erman makes it greater.\r\n\r\nWestern Mongolia, (west of the meridian of Lassa, and west of the\r\npoint where the Tarine flows into Lake Lop,) upper Bokhara, and upper\r\nToorkistan were formerly considered to be a highland district; this is\r\nnow subject to doubt. We shall discuss this further on.\r\n\r\nAfrica, too, has highlands of the first class, which, however, do not\r\nrise to the extreme height of the plateau of Thibet. As in Asia, so in\r\ncentral Africa, the old supposition of the existence of a plateau of\r\ncolossal extent has been very much done away with by the more exact and\r\ncritical modern investigations. The strip of territory lying between 4°\r\nand 10° north latitude has been demonstrated by Barth and Vogel to be\r\ndestitute of highlands. The range of mountains announced as discovered\r\nby Mungo Park, and called the Kong Mountains, is proved to have no real\r\nexistence, and of course his statement fails of verification that that\r\nrange is the northern limit of an elevated central plateau. The peaks\r\nwhich really do rise in the Kong territory form no continuous ridge; they\r\nare mere isolated groups of moderate height. Between these groups the\r\nlowlands continue toward the south, in an unbroken level, for an immense\r\ndistance. How far south of the equator the central African plateau\r\nbegins, is yet unascertained, for the snow-tipped peaks of Kilimandjaro\r\nand Kenia, discovered by Rebmann and Krapf, in the parallel of Mombas,\r\n1° to 3° south latitude, are of immense height, it is true, but they do\r\nnot demonstrate the existence of a plateau of the first class there. They\r\nrise out of table-land about 2000 feet above the sea level, which Krapf\r\nexplored in the year 1849.\r\n\r\nThe Abyssinian plateau, on the contrary, takes rank among the most\r\nelevated on the globe. At 10° north latitude, south of the sources of\r\nthe Blue Nile, lies Upper Abyssinia, or the kingdom of Shoa, with its\r\ncapitals, Ankobar and Angolalla, 10,000 feet above the sea. Still farther\r\nto the north, in the ancient kingdom of Gondar, the German naturalist\r\nRüppel ascertained the level of Lake Tzana to be 7000 feet above the\r\nocean; to the southward of that the land rises to a still greater height,\r\nand northward of Gondar the plateau ascends to an elevation of 8000 feet,\r\nand mountains are met with 14,000 feet high. The terrace of Axaw on the\r\neast is 6650 feet above the Red Sea, which lies along its border.\r\n\r\nTo the south of Shoa lie the highlands of Kaffa and Enarea. All\r\ntravelers agree in the statement that the inhabitants of that region are\r\nlight-complexioned; and Johnson draws from this the conclusion that the\r\ncentral plateau must rise to a height of over 10,000 feet to harbor\r\npeople of a whiter hue than the dwellers of the less elevated localities.\r\nHe saw a number of men of light complexion who came as far as from the\r\nfifth degree south latitude, not from mountain homes, but from high\r\ntable-lands.\r\n\r\nThe plateau of South Africa rises at Lattakoo, in the country of the\r\nBechuanas, north of the Orange River, to the height of 6000 feet. To\r\nthe east, near the Snow Mountains, where the river has its source, it\r\nascends to an altitude of over 10,000 feet. To the north, discovery had\r\nmade great progress since 1849. There, on a broad plateau, Oswell and\r\nLivingstone brought to the knowledge of the world the existence of Lake\r\nNgami, whose surface is 2825 feet above the level of the sea. The plateau\r\nwhich includes this lake at its place of deepest depression cannot be\r\nless than 3000 feet high, and at some localities yet higher. Still more\r\nto the north, at latitude 14° south, on the water-shed between the Zaire\r\nor Congo on the west and the Zambeze in the east, the plateau reaches\r\nan elevation of 5000 feet, according to Livingstone. Yet farther to the\r\nwest, it rises still higher and takes undisputed rank among plateaus of\r\nthe first class. There, at 18° south latitude, Galtne, on his journey of\r\ndiscovery in 1850, ascended the table-land of Ovompâ, a region of great\r\nnatural productivity. On the way thither, going from south to north, at\r\n21° south latitude, and therefore in the parallel of Lake Ngami, but\r\nabout 500 miles westward, he ascended north of the Swakop River, the\r\ntable-land of Demara, which he found to be 6000 feet high. From that\r\nplateau mountains, Koniati and Ometako, for instance, rise to a height\r\nof 8800 feet. From the Swakop River to Lake Ngami there is a continuous\r\nplateau.\r\n\r\nThe high table-land of southern central Africa does not then extend, as\r\nwas once supposed, as far north as 9° north latitude, nor even to the\r\nlater limit of 4½° north latitude; but at about 4° 10′ the distinction\r\nbetween lowland and highland seems to be sharply drawn, as the cataracts\r\nwhich terminate the navigation of the White Nile indicate. Here Father\r\nKnoblecher turned back in 1849, but he ascended the first of the\r\nmountains which there began to rise; his eye reached onward to mountains\r\nvery near or on the equator. He says that those high mountains stand\r\nupon an elevated table-land. Thus, here at the source of the White Nile\r\nwe have a plateau seemingly of the first rank. From such a plateau it is\r\nprobable that the snow-capped mountains, seen by Rebmann and Krapf in the\r\nneighborhood of the equator, rose, which they thought, approaching from\r\nthe eastern coast, held the source of the Nile.\r\n\r\nAt the northwest of Africa, too, at 10° north latitude, the territory\r\nwhich feeds the springs of the Senegal and the Niger is supposed to be a\r\nplateau of great elevation and of great extent. But at present our lack\r\nof knowledge prevents our attaining certainty regarding it. No thorough\r\nsystem of measurement has been yet applied there.\r\n\r\nAmerica possesses a number of plateaus of the first class. To the\r\nmost prominent of these belong the ones which were first thoroughly\r\nstudied by Alexander von Humboldt. It is to him that we owe our first\r\naccurate impressions of table-lands which, before his day, had been\r\nindiscriminately confounded with mountains, and had had no place assigned\r\nto them in the department of Geography. Doubtless, too, great prominence\r\nwas given to plateaus at the outset; they were pushed into unseemly\r\nproportion to other matters as well worthy of investigation, but they\r\nhave come into their true place, and now only wait the development of new\r\nfacts regarding the size and height of some, to be properly understood\r\nand appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe measurements made in North, Central, and South America give the\r\nfollowing results; much more complete, it may be remarked, than the\r\nresults yet gained in Asia and Africa.\r\n\r\nTo the plateaus of the first class belong in America, at latitude 0°, the\r\nplain of Quito, almost 9000 feet above the sea, (Los Pastos in the north\r\nbeing near 11,000 feet,) and to the south, at 17° south latitude, the\r\nplateau of Upper Peru. Here the great Lake Yiticaca is found, 12,000 feet\r\nabove the sea; eastward of the lake, the table-land rises yet higher, and\r\nat Alto de Toleda it is 14,000 feet in elevation, as high as the highest\r\npart of Thibet. At 20° south latitude, south of Lake Yiticaca, is the\r\nCity of Potosi, whose streets are 12,822 feet above the Pacific.\r\n\r\nIn Central America is found, at 20° north latitude, the extended\r\ntable-land of Mexico, 500 miles wide, rising to a height of 7000 feet,\r\nand farther to the north, in New Mexico, the plateau of Santa Fé, 35°\r\nnorth latitude east of the Rocky Mountains, and 7100 feet above the sea.\r\nThe table-land on the west side of the mountains, and toward the Great\r\nSalt Lake, is undoubtedly just as elevated.\r\n\r\nEurope and Australia are wanting in plateaus of the first rank, and in\r\ngeneral the whole immense flat northern districts of the globe, though we\r\nare not yet quite familiar enough with the extreme north of America to\r\nspeak with entire confidence regarding it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plateaus of the Second Class._\r\n\r\nElevated plains which are at once continuous and bounded by a definite\r\nline of demarkation, and which do not attain an altitude of more than\r\n4000 or 5000 feet, are considered plateaus of the second class. They\r\nare far more general over the whole earth than plateaus of the first\r\nclass; in every one of the great divisions of the globe they appear in\r\nthe utmost possible diversities of elevation, sometimes so gradually\r\nascending that the lowest limit is hardly to be perceived. This makes it\r\nnot only expedient but necessary to assign to plateaus a fixed though\r\narbitrary system of classification, for without it we could attain to no\r\nthorough view of all their relations. This general system must afterward\r\nbe confirmed and justified by protracted special investigations.\r\n\r\nThat not all the vast plains of Central Asia, from Thibet to the Altai\r\nMountains, and from the Belur range to the Chinese Gobi, belong to\r\nthe first class of plateaus, has been demonstrated by the Russian\r\nmeasurements, made by Fuss and Bunge in 1832, between Lake Baikal,\r\nKiakhta, and Peking, and rendered highly probable by the investigations\r\nof Klaproth, Humboldt, and Zimmermann. Toward the northwest the plateaus\r\ngenerally sink from the moderate elevation of the Middle Gobi, 4000 feet,\r\nto Lake Baikal, 1332 feet above the sea, Lake Zaison, not 1000 feet above\r\nthe sea, and the border of the plateau at Choimailocha, the Chinese\r\nfrontier post on the Siberian line, 1000 feet above the sea, then to the\r\nlower border of the plateau of Bookhtarminsk (936 feet) and Semipalatinsk\r\non the Irtish, (708 feet,) where the great Siberian plain begins. In the\r\nvalley of the Tarim and of Lake Lop, pomegranates and grapes thrive, and\r\ncotton, which has been raised of an excellent quality in Eelee, is found\r\nat a height of from 1200 to 2000 feet. And in contrast with the great\r\narctic plain of Northern Asia, not 500 feet above the level of the sea,\r\nthis central plateau will take its place as distinctively of the second\r\nrank.\r\n\r\nThe plateau of Persia lies on the border of both classes; for while the\r\ncentral portion touches 4000 feet, some parts rise much higher and some\r\nsink much deeper than the normal point. These balance each other, and the\r\naverage is about the maximum elevation of plateaus of the second degree.\r\n\r\nEast of the Persian plateau lies the plateau of Cabool, 6000 feet above\r\nthe sea. On the northern edge of Afghanistan is the plateau of Bamain,\r\n7500 feet in elevation. More to the south is the high plain of Candahar,\r\nbeing 3500 feet, and the City of Candahar, 3264 feet above the sea. The\r\nplateau of Kweltah west of the Bolan Pass is 5220 feet. Still farther to\r\nthe south is the great plain of Beloochistan, 7000 feet, with the City of\r\nKelat, 5418 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nIn the central part of the eastern Persian plateau in ancient Gedrosia,\r\nDrangiana, and Parthia, and Lake Zareh, the depression is the lowest.\r\nAt Lake Zareh the elevation is 2100 feet; at Herat, more to the north,\r\n2628 feet. In West Persia, on the meridian of the Caspian Sea, it rises\r\nhigher; on the northern edge at Teheran it is 3672 feet; at Schabred,\r\nsoutheast of Astrabad, it is 4000 feet; at Kasbin, west of Teheran, it\r\nis 4000 feet; and at Samegon, 5700 feet. The lowest depression at Com\r\nand Kashan is not 2000 feet above the sea. Toward the northwest Persia\r\nthrusts up a short arm into the adjoining territory of Armenia. This is\r\nthe highland of Ayerbaijan, Zoroaster’s “Land of Fire.” This connecting\r\nplateau of 7000 feet elevation belongs to the first class. To the west\r\nof this the plateau of Armenia extends in varying range of elevation,\r\nfrom that of Lake Van, 5124 feet, to the plain of the Aras, (the\r\nancient Araxes,) on which the double cone of Ararat rises to a height\r\nof 14,656 feet. But the table-land at the northern base of Ararat, the\r\nsite of Erdschmiazin, is only 2860 feet high, Erivan a little higher,\r\nand Erdzeroune, on the plateau of the Taurus, the plain of the Upper\r\nEuphrates, 5730 feet.\r\n\r\nThe plateaus of Asia Minor embrace wide plains extending through the\r\nwhole of the country, at an elevation toward the east, in ancient\r\nLycaonia and Cappadocia, of 3000 feet, and sinking toward the west to\r\n2000 feet.\r\n\r\nTo the plateaus of Armenia and Lycaonia, Strabo, whose home was there,\r\nand who carefully studied them, gave the expressive name of ὀροπέδια,\r\n_i.e._ mountain plains, a term which corresponds remarkably with our word\r\nplateau, but which, as Humboldt has remarked, was not of much use among\r\nthe ancients. Strabo, however, directed attention also to the Oropedia of\r\nSicily and India.\r\n\r\nIn India, Deccan displays similar formations, which rise gradually\r\nfrom south to north in Mysore, in Poonah of the Mahrattas, and in the\r\ntable-land of Vindhya and Malwah, to 2000, 3000, and even 4000 feet.\r\nDeccan enjoys an admirable climate and the richest abundance of all\r\nnatural productions. China too must have plateaus, for the Chinese word\r\n_youen_ indicates very clearly a large elevated plain.\r\n\r\nIn Arabia the plateaus of the second class are largely found, and their\r\nheight ascends from north to south, instead of from south to north as in\r\nDeccan. The Syrian Hauran is 2000 feet high, the plateau of Damascus 2200\r\nfeet, the plateau of Taif, above Mecca, 3000 feet, the plateau of Sapaa,\r\nin Southern Arabia, 4000 feet.\r\n\r\nIn North Africa that portion of the great Sahara which has heretofore\r\nbeen considered a low plain, lying between Tripoli and Lake Tchad, has\r\nbeen ascertained by the German explorers, Overweg and Vogel, to be\r\na table-land of the second class, ranging in elevation from 1000 to\r\n2000 feet. It begins at the Chorean plateau (2000 feet) in the south\r\nof Tripoli, and sinks to an elevation of 800 feet in the neighborhood\r\nof Lake Tchad. The average altitude is about 1500 feet. This moderate\r\nelevation of Sahara corresponds with the equally high plateau of\r\nCyrenaica, 2000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe Atlas plateau, in the northwest of Africa, rises to a greater\r\nheight—2000 to 3000 feet; the upper course of the Draa, near the Sahara,\r\nbeing 3000 feet; the high, broad table-land on which Timbuctoo lies,\r\naccording to Renon’s measurement, is 1500 to 1800 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nIn south Africa the low, or rather the moderate plateau, which borders\r\nthe district of the Bechuanas on the north, rises, as it advances toward\r\nthe lower rim of Africa, at Cape Colony, to an altitude of 3000 feet.\r\n\r\nAmerica has many plateaus of the second range of elevation, but her\r\nhighlands of the first class are so imposing in extent, as well as\r\nin elevation, that they have been more carefully observed than the\r\ntable-lands of the second class.\r\n\r\nAlong the eastern slope of the Andes, on the same parallel with the\r\ngreat plains of the Orinoco, the Amazon, and the La Plata, these\r\nplateaus extend, touching the base of the mountains, and appearing\r\nrather as terraces, or vast plains of transition, from the highlands to\r\nthe lowlands, than as independent forms. Where Alexander von Humboldt\r\nmeasured them, west of the low plains of the Amazon, he found their\r\nheight, measured from the sea, to range from 1050 to 1200 feet; he\r\ndescribes them as having the appearance of vast plains, and as differing\r\nfrom the lowlands of the Amazon only in their greater elevation; their\r\nslope toward the narrowing of the Pongo de Mauseriche being too slight to\r\nbe appreciable.\r\n\r\nBetween the threefold forks of the Northern Andes, Humboldt ascertained\r\nthe heights of ten plateaus, extending as far as the plains of Orinoco,\r\nand called by the various names, according to their elevation—Tierras\r\ntempladas, or temperate districts, Tierras calientas, or warm districts,\r\nand Tierras frias, or cold districts—varying in height from 1800 to 6600\r\nfeet, the highest belonging clearly to the first class of plateaus.\r\n\r\nThe mountains of Brazil are interspersed among plateaus of the second\r\nclass. The Brazilian mountains are not true ranges, but lie in groups,\r\ntheir height varying from 2700 to 5700 feet, and between them are the\r\nvast elevated plains, called Campas, which are true plateaus of the\r\nsecond class.\r\n\r\nThe southern point of South America, south of the Rio Negro, as far as\r\nthe Straits of Magellan, known as the plateau of Patagonia, is a true\r\ntable-land of from 1200 to 1400 feet in height. It is composed of ragged\r\nstrata of porphyry or of vast lava-masses, and has been explored by\r\nCaptain Fitz Roy, in 1837, from the mouth of the Santa Cruz River to\r\nthe snow-capped Andes in the west. The plateau diminishes gradually in\r\nelevation from west to east, till it touches the sea line.\r\n\r\nIn North America the broad plateau extending through Northern Texas and\r\nthe Indian Territory, and lying on both sides of the Arkansas River,\r\nincreases in elevation gradually from St. Louis, on the Mississippi,\r\nless than 500 feet above the sea, to Santa Fé, on the upper course of\r\nthe Rio Bravo, 7000 feet above the sea. It ascends so slightly that the\r\nrise is imperceptible to the eye, the broad plains there taking the name\r\nof prairies. St. Louis is 420 feet in absolute elevation; the eastern\r\nArkansas plateau 1500 to 3000 feet; the high western Arkansas table-land\r\nfrom 3000 to 7000 feet, where, at the point of greatest altitude, lies\r\nthe City of Santa Fé, in the Territory of New Mexico, 7047 feet above\r\nthe sea. This broad, sloping tract reaches out to a great extent at the\r\nnorth, crossing the Missouri, and embracing the colossal North American\r\nlakes. Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, about 578 feet deep, and Lake\r\nSuperior, 627 feet deep, lie in vast hollows in that great continuous\r\nplateau, which extends into the British Possessions, rises again to 800\r\nor 1000 feet in elevation, and is rocky and craggy, yet not enough so as\r\nto take the name of a mountain chain, but simply to form a clearly-marked\r\nwater-shed, which Fremont and Nicollet have measured.\r\n\r\nIn Australia and Europe plateaus of the second grade of elevation are\r\nnot wanting. In Australia, however, they are limited to the triangular\r\ndistrict in the southeast, which has become the place of settlement\r\nfor the chief English colonies, and which, bearing the name of King’s\r\nTable-land, rises to a height of 2500 feet, and occupies the largest area\r\nof all the Australian table-lands.\r\n\r\nIn Europe this physical feature is displayed most distinctly in the\r\nSpanish plateaus, which occupy by far the largest proportion of the\r\nentire peninsula. Madrid lies on one of these plateaus, at a height of\r\n2100 feet, five times as high as Paris, on the Seine, and as high as\r\nInnspruck, in the very heart of the Tyrol; Toledo, in the valley of the\r\nTagus, is 1734 feet above the sea. The average elevation of New Castile,\r\nthe central part of Spain, is 2000 feet. Old Castile, which borders\r\nit on the north, separated from it by the Guadarrama ridge, is about a\r\nthousand feet higher. Burgos, in the center, is 2700 feet above the sea;\r\nSegovia, to the south, 3100 feet. The average elevation of Old Castile is\r\n3000 feet.\r\n\r\nThen comes in natural order the Bavarian plateau, in southern Germany,\r\nranging from 1500 to 1600 feet high, a broad table-land, on which lie\r\nMunich and Augsburg. It extends along the course of the Danube from west\r\nto east, from Lower Switzerland to Ratisbon.\r\n\r\nAccording to the mean measurements of Humboldt, the lower plateau of\r\nAuvergne, in southern France, is 1040 feet in elevation; still less in\r\naltitude (840 feet) is the plateau of Burgundy and Lothringia, between\r\nthe Vosges and the Ardennes. Limousin, Aveyron, la Forez, Monts, and Côte\r\nd’Or are plateaus.\r\n\r\nThe plateau of Lothringia, whose mean elevation is 648 feet, lies between\r\nthe Rhine and the Moselle. The plateau of Luxemburg extends northward to\r\nthe Eifel, where Prum lies, and to the Ardennes, where Malmedy, Eupen,\r\nNamur, Liege, and Aix-la-Chapelle lie.\r\n\r\nIn Middle Germany, a series of plateaus of the second grade begins in\r\nUpper Hesse, and extends eastward, crossed by mountains and valleys,\r\ntraversing Upper Silesia and Galicia, and running along the northern side\r\nof the Carpathian Mountains to Podolia, on the Dnieper, thus embracing a\r\nstrip extending through the larger part of central Europe.\r\n\r\nA line of plateaus begins still farther to the north, at the low hills\r\nof Jutland, crossing Holstein, Mecklenberg, the whole southern edge\r\nof Pomerania, and extending to Lithuania and the Valdai Hills. It is\r\ncharacterized by a band of inland lakes, whose basins it incloses, and\r\nis crossed by the valleys of the Oder, Vistula, Niemen, and Duna. It has\r\nbeen called the Pomerania lake country. In the hollows where the lakes\r\nlie, (whose surfaces are, at the highest, not more than 300 feet above\r\nthe sea,) and yet more in the depressions, where rivers break through,\r\nthe level descends to as low a point as that of the great plain of\r\nCentral Europe; but at other places it rises to an elevation as high as\r\n500 feet, and so touches upon the limits of plateaus of the second range.\r\nMany parts of this broad upland may possibly be formed of shifting sand\r\ndunes which have been gradually piled up along the sea line. The plateau\r\nreaches its highest point at the eastern end, in the Valdai Hills, where\r\nit averages 1000 feet in elevation. The highest point is 1100 feet. East\r\nof the Volga, which rises at the eastern side of these hills, the plateau\r\nfalls off by imperceptible steps, till it is lost in the great Russian\r\nplain.\r\n\r\nIn the peninsulas of Southern Europe, as in the Morea, (2000 feet,) and\r\nin the Crimea, (800 to 1200 feet,) the plateau again appears in not\r\ninsignificant proportions.\r\n\r\nThe lower range of plateaus, it will be seen, is far more frequently met\r\nwith through all parts of the earth than the higher, yet both combined\r\noccupy a larger share of the surface of the globe. We can designate them\r\nas sharply defined and broadly massive elevations, in contradistinction\r\nto the long, narrow, and broken masses which have received the name of\r\nmountain chains. The latter have too often been confounded with the\r\nformer and have received from geographers a treatment disproportionately\r\nfull in relation to their claims. The plateau has been until recently\r\nan almost forgotten geographical element. Humboldt restored it to its\r\nrightful place; by many hundreds of measurements he has accurately\r\nsettled its form, its effect on climate, on isothermal lines, on\r\nagriculture, on the physical and moral life of nations, and even on the\r\ncourse of human history.\r\n\r\nIn closing this attempt at a general consideration of plateaus, I must\r\nconfirm the reproach which Humboldt has cast upon most geographers of\r\nthis day for their abuse of the word plateau. And I must at the same\r\ntime admit that it is justly due to some parts of my own “Erdkunde,”\r\nwhere I have considered the plateau systems of Central Asia and Africa.\r\nWhen I wrote the pages of that work, thirty and more years ago, there\r\nwere no scientific measurements then made of those regions, and the\r\ngeneral ignorance led to a premature generalization, in which I used the\r\nascertained features of the New World as probably in analogy with the\r\nunexplored center of the Old World. This use of really untrue analogies\r\nwas carried by others to great lengths, and choratographers went so far\r\nas to depict the country according to the hypothesis of those who had\r\nwritten at first hand, and after using all the lights then existing, but\r\nwho had never supposed that what they had indicated in general terms,\r\nwould be afterward made so definite and real to the public eye. Those\r\nuntrue statements of my own, I must leave however just as they are,\r\nand rejoice that the great advance of science has led to the accurate\r\nknowledge of the great plateaus of which the civilized world then knew\r\nbut little. One word more: I set the lower limit of plateaus of the\r\nsecond grade at 500 feet, lower therefore than the great master in\r\nPhysical Geography set his.\r\n\r\n“Elevations of the soil,” says Humboldt, “which do not display a marked\r\ndifference in climate and vegetation from the country around them, are\r\nnot rightly called plateaus.” His meaning is, that the name does not\r\nrelate to absolute height measured from the sea, but harmonious climatic\r\nrelations existing between contiguous districts, one of which is more\r\nelevated than the other. Highland and lowland are therefore to him words\r\nof unfixed meaning, if they do not stand in the contrast of height,\r\nclimate, relief, and rates of temperature. Humboldt therefore did not\r\nconsider the depression of Central Asia, at the Taringol, as a plateau;\r\nand table-lands from 200 to 1200 feet in absolute elevation, _i.e._ from\r\nthe sea level, are passed over by him as not worthy of the same name\r\nwhich he applied to the plains 6000 to 10,000 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nDealing as I do with the elementary features and the physical contrasts\r\nof countries which for the most part are now thoroughly explored, I\r\nprefer, for the purpose of elucidating the subject of Physical Geography,\r\nto consider the plateau as beginning at 500 feet above the level of the\r\nsea. By comparing the plateaus of both hemispheres it is not difficult to\r\ndeal with a variety of features, and to make a number of discriminations\r\nwhich, without an absolute standard, it would be impossible to make.\r\n\r\nWe pass to the consideration of the much more varied and more imposing\r\ncharacteristics of mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nMountains and Mountain Lands.\r\n\r\nMountain lands cannot, in the strict use of language, be compared with\r\nplateaus, except in way of contrast, because they are not uniform, broad,\r\nand sharply defined tracts, but extend in a linear direction, having as\r\ntheir chief feature the longitudinal axis of the mountain chain. Groups\r\nof mountain ridges may be separated from each other, or may be united in\r\nany coherent way which does not make them continuous, and yet, despite\r\nthe want of continuity, form a perfect whole.\r\n\r\nMountains, with their fissures, chasms, abysses, valleys, ravines,\r\nclefts, precipices,—in a word, their varied diversities of feature,\r\nbroken through in every direction, the whole chain rent into fragments by\r\nthese transverse breaks, are in direct contrast with plateaus. They have\r\nquite often a common range of elevation, which, measured from the sea\r\nlevel, is not unfrequently much greater than the districts lying at their\r\nbase. Yet this relation is only incidental, it is not essential. There\r\nis no necessary connection between the height of the outlying plateau\r\nand the height of the mountain range. In Switzerland the mountains rise\r\nto the altitude of 13,000 or 14,000 feet; the country at the foot of the\r\nAlps is but 1000 to 2000 feet above the sea. Here the distance between\r\nthe summit and the plateau at the base suggests no relation between them.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive characteristic of a mountain land is the height of\r\nisolated groups. Great differences of elevation within small distances\r\ncharacterize mountain regions; small differences within great distances\r\ncharacterize plateaus. The plateau depends upon uniform evenness of\r\nsurface, or an approximation to it, over a large extent of territory.\r\nThe mountain range is the exact opposite, the development of all kinds\r\nof extremes within a limited space, and the consequent individualization\r\nof the locality where it stands. Mountain lands cannot therefore be\r\nidentified with the type of the highland and the plateau. The mountain\r\nchain has a character of its own, whether existing in unbroken unity, or\r\nsubdivided into subordinate ranges, ridges, and spurs, and whether the\r\nsummits are conical or sharply pointed,—whether also of moderate, medium,\r\nor loftiest elevation.\r\n\r\nAnd high as mountains rise, their height is equivalenced by the depth of\r\nthe depressions which form their valleys; the higher the mountain, the\r\ndeeper the abyss which cleaves to the base. The immensely elevated peaks\r\nof the loftiest chains find their correspondence in the narrow ravines\r\nand the mountain lakes at the foot; the precipitous summits of the great\r\nAmerican chain have their barrancos in the Andes and their cañons in the\r\nRocky Mountains. The valleys are in natural contrast with the summits.\r\nThey have just as little of the uniformity of lowland plains as the\r\nmountain tops have of the uniformity of elevated table-lands. They are\r\ninfinite in variety, highly individualized, and always adapt themselves\r\nto the characteristics of the chain which conditions them. The mountain,\r\ntoo, has no uniformity in its character; it embraces within the smallest\r\ncompass the production of all climes, and unites the characteristics of\r\nboth highland and lowland. Mountain regions have therefore had a great\r\ninfluence in history and in the development of humanity, even greater\r\nthan the more monotonous plateaus, which in general harbor nomadic\r\nraces and give little encouragement to permanently settled people. For\r\nthis reason the geographer cannot, like the geologist, classify high\r\ntable-lands and mountains together; he cannot draw the same inferences\r\nfrom the plateau as from the mountain range; to the geographer the\r\nplateau is not a lower type of mountain, but the two, in their relations\r\nto man and to history, suggest entirely different results and condition\r\nentirely different processes.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it must be confessed that mountains do stand in intimate\r\nconnection with plateaus of both classes, and that the transitions from\r\nthe one form to the other are well worthy of study. Yet the present lack\r\nof correct measurements has made this little understood.\r\n\r\nIt is not the element of height alone which gives mountains their\r\nsignificance. There are many other features, which are little studied,\r\nyet of real import. It is, however, not a matter of indifference whether\r\na chain thrusts up its peaks 1000, 5000, 10,000, or 20,000 feet, and the\r\nheight has been made and will continue to be made a subject of careful\r\ninvestigation. In reference to height, we distinguish what, in a general\r\nsense, we call mountains,[3] into hills, mounts, and mountains of various\r\ndegrees of magnitude. Yet the height of the highest range, in comparison\r\nwith the diameter of the earth, is insignificant, only about ¹⁄₁₇₀₀, and\r\nthe combined mass of mountains are of no more account in comparing them\r\nwith the entire mass of the globe, than the roughnesses on the rind of\r\nan apple, or perhaps more exactly still, than those on the shell of an\r\negg. The combined mountain systems in the world would not suffice, if\r\ntransferred to the North and South Pole, to fill out the earth to such an\r\nextent that the polar and equatorial diameters would be equal.\r\n\r\nIn following out his profound scientific investigations, Alexander von\r\nHumboldt, in order to ascertain the center of the earth’s gravity,\r\ntaking into account the existing elevations above the ocean level, was\r\nled to the conclusion that too great importance was formerly assigned to\r\nmountains in their relations not to the course of history, but to the\r\nearth as subject to mathematical laws. Very careful observations revealed\r\nthe fact to him that all the mountains of France, if reduced to a level\r\nand spread out, would raise the grade of the whole country to a height\r\nnot more than 816 feet above the sea line. All the mountains of Europe,\r\ndistributed in like manner, would raise the level to only about 630 feet.\r\nIn Asia the same process would make the vast plain only 1080 feet high,\r\nin North America 702 feet, in South America only 1062 feet; while the\r\nmountains of the entire globe would raise the level to only 947 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea. So insignificant are the combined mountain\r\nsystems of the earth in respect to size, in comparison with the immense\r\nbody on which they stand, though their importance is great when we regard\r\ntheir influence on the localities where they are found. Yet in this last\r\nregard, mountains deserve careful study, for they not only exercise and\r\nhave exercised a great influence over nature and man, but they serve as\r\nour best key to open to our view the internal structure of the earth.\r\n\r\nSome mountains, though of great height and broad base, like Etna,\r\nVesuvius, Teneriffe, and many volcanoes, belong to no true mountain\r\nsystem; and even when they lie near together, and yet have no inner\r\nprinciple of unity, they are not spoken of as a chain or a range: they\r\nmake merely a mountainous district. It is the repetition of the common\r\ntype and the existence of a continuous valley which gives a right to use\r\nthe names chain and range.\r\n\r\nThe linear extent and height of mountain ranges vary very much; no\r\ndefinite limits to these can be assigned. Yet there are few chains which\r\nare less than 25 miles long and 1500 feet high. Other features are\r\nnecessary in order to determine the strict application of the word chain\r\nor range; one is a ridge-like or comb-like aspect; (that it should be a\r\nwater-shed is not essential, although very common;) another feature is\r\nthat the rock composing it should be of the same geological formation.\r\nSand dunes, although occurring in regular and ridge-like uniformity,\r\nlike those in Holland, and looking from a distance like a mountain chain,\r\nare not to be reckoned as mountain chains, though like the tells on the\r\nSyrian steppes and dunes in the Netherlands and along the Baltic coast,\r\nthey sometimes rise to the height of a thousand feet. In South Germany\r\nand in the neighborhood of lofty mountains, such elevations are called\r\nmere hills; at the north foot of the Alps, yet greater heights are almost\r\nalways called level land. In judging of the fitness with which the word\r\nmountain is used, it must always be remembered whether he who employs\r\nit dwells among the Himalayas or on the lowlands of eastern Europe; and\r\nin order to give any fixedness to the use of the word, it is necessary\r\nto take into account other physical characteristics besides height. By\r\ncommon usage, however, the Alps have become the standard of comparison\r\nfor all the mountains of the world, mainly because, besides having their\r\nimposing height, they are found in the middle of the temperate zone;\r\nthey are the most convenient to study of any great system on the globe.\r\nIn respect to height, we divide these into four grades: the lowest from\r\n2000 to 5000 feet above the sea; the next from 5000 to 8000; the next\r\nfrom 8000 to 10,000; and the highest from 10,000 on to the height of Mont\r\nBlanc.\r\n\r\nAnother standard might be found in the colossal Himalaya chain of Asia,\r\nand the Cordilleras of both Americas, which could easily be brought into\r\nunison with the Alpine chain of Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe linear direction of a mountain chain, the axis of elevation as we\r\nmight say, (so sharply hinted at in the very word mountain-chain,)\r\nbrings out relations which vary not only according to the longitudinal\r\ndirection itself, but to the lateral extent, the number of mountains,\r\nthe situation, and the ramification of the chain. If the direction be\r\na straight one, we can rightly speak of an axis of elevation. According\r\nto Humboldt’s measurements, this axis in the Pyrenees is 230 miles in\r\nlength; in the Alps, from Mont Blanc to the Hungarian frontier, 515\r\nmiles; the Ural Mountains, 550 to 2042 miles; the Scandinavian Mountains,\r\n1100 miles; the Altai Mountains, 9900 miles; the Kuenlun, 1600 miles;\r\nthe Thian-Shan, in Inner China, 1700 to 2150 miles; the Himalayas,\r\n1600 miles; the Yablonoi Chrabet, 550 miles; the Aldan, 400 miles; the\r\nGhauts, 760 miles; the Andes of South America, 4400 miles; and the whole\r\nCordillera of North America, 9200 miles. There is often much doubt about\r\nthe true beginning and ending of a mountain chain, and judgments differ\r\naccording as they rest on the fact of elevation or on the geological\r\ntraces of upheaval where they begin to be manifest. Geographers are not\r\nagreed, for example, whether the Ural Mountains continue as far north as\r\nNova Zembla, and whether one or two chains in America are to be spoken of\r\nas traversing the plateau of Mexico.\r\n\r\nIf there are parallel ranges, it is correct to speak of a transverse\r\naxis, running at right angles with the main axis. There is, it is\r\napparent, a marked difference between simple chains and the accumulated\r\nparallel chains, where breadth is a prominent element, as in the Vosges,\r\nthe Black Forest Mountains, the Fichtel range, the Hartz, the Ardennes.\r\nThe parallel rows form a mountain system. Yet all great chains are made\r\nup of smaller ones, of groups at least, and so are mountain systems.\r\nOften the grouping is seemingly irregular, a lawless aggregation, but\r\nonly because our knowledge is incomplete, and the law of arrangement\r\nconcealed from us. This law is traced in the very geological qualities\r\nof the chain, not in the later form. The outer form is often very\r\ndeceptive, the very convulsions which indicate the surer signs having\r\nserved to obliterate what we should suppose the most prominent marks. The\r\npresent of mountains must often be studied in the light of their past.\r\nOrography must be interpreted by geology. But the geological surveys\r\nof the earth are as yet very imperfect; the outer form has often to be\r\naccepted as the only guide. Orography and geology are two sciences which\r\nnow go on hand in hand.\r\n\r\nIn the simple mountain chain it is easy to discriminate between the parts\r\nwhich make it up; the base is easily ascertainable and the ascent to\r\nthe comb-like ridge is readily traced; the eye does not fail to see the\r\nrelation between the special prominent heights and the chain from which\r\nthey rise, and to trace the manner in which spurs and outlying mountains\r\nare connected with the main chain. Small isolated collections of\r\nmountains are especially valuable as elementary studies, for they always\r\nhave a unity of their own. And all the greater and well-known chains are\r\nmade up of smaller, simple chains, whose connection and mutual relations\r\nare, however, sometimes exceedingly difficult to trace. But the character\r\nof the whole is not sometimes ascertainable with this preliminary\r\nknowledge of the parts.\r\n\r\nThe true base of a mountain chain, the line of periphery, in consequence\r\nof the general unevenness of the adjacent country, must be ascertained\r\nby very exact measurements with the level. The geologist does not\r\nbegin with this step, he strikes deeper, and seeks the place where the\r\nstructure diverges from that of the more level land lying near; and, in\r\nthe search after the basis of structure, he discovers the unity of the\r\nrange from the foot to the summit. The whole geological district which\r\nhas been upheaved into mountains, Leopold von Buch found to be generally\r\nellipsoidal in form, the longer axis being far more prominent than the\r\nshorter one. The axis of most mountain chains is, then, the longer axis\r\nof an ellipsoid. The Swiss Alps display about a dozen such ellipsoids,\r\nof different characteristics, and arranged according to no perceptible\r\nlaw of harmony. Each is developed from its own base, as the trunk of a\r\ntree grows out of its root. These separate bases lie contiguously, but\r\nthe peaks which shoot up are widely sundered. The forms of the mountain\r\ngroups resulting from this are, of course, various. Some of them I will\r\nbriefly characterize.\r\n\r\n1. The longer axes of the subordinate chains may run in parallels, as in\r\none portion of the Swiss Alps, the Jura, the Ural Mountains, the Mexican\r\nCordilleras, and the Himalayas.\r\n\r\n2. The chains may diverge or converge. The Alps diverge at the east, and\r\nthe forks run northeast and southeast respectively; the Rocky Mountains,\r\ntoward the Arctic regions, divide into from five to seven diverging\r\nchains. Converging ranges may come together at varying angles, and\r\nthese can mass themselves into confused mountain knots, the summits of\r\nwhich soar to amazing heights, as the West and Middle Alps do around\r\nMont Blanc. Alexander von Humboldt distinguishes five of these mountain\r\nknots in the Andes, Porco, Cuzco, Pasco, Assuay, and Los Pastos, whose\r\nconstruction, carefully studied, he considered, gives the key to the\r\nstructure of the whole chain. Side chains often display this knotted\r\nform, as in Upper Peru around Lake Titicaca, the three branches of the\r\nUral, at the Irmel Tau, the Himalaya, Kuenlun, and Hindoo Koosh chains,\r\nin upper Afghanistan, and the ranges of Swiss Alps, which converge around\r\nSt. Gothard. Yet the convolutions which these mountain chains make at\r\ntheir point of convergence are never regular, never mathematically exact,\r\nbut to be measured in sections, and the traces of a linear direction\r\nto be carefully sought with the compass. The whole has, to the eye, a\r\nlabyrinthine appearance, and the law of structure is only ascertained,\r\nwith exactness, by the geological features, the direction of the strata,\r\nand the like. The geographer must call in the geologist to help him solve\r\nhis problems.[4]\r\n\r\n3. If from some high central point the mountain ranges radiate\r\nin the form of a star, they form a new variety of system called,\r\nfor convenience, by the name “star-shaped.” In volcanic mountains\r\nthis configuration is common, as in Mont d’Or and in Auvergne. The\r\nsouthwestern Alps, known sometimes as the Sea Alps, the Ural at the\r\nArctic Ocean, the Quito range of the Andes, are types of this form.\r\n\r\n4. The ring-shaped system is in direct contrast with the last. It is\r\nfound where mountain chains are arranged in a circle, inclosing a plateau\r\nof larger or smaller extent. There are two marked examples of this form\r\nin Europe: Bohemia and Transylvania. The ring of mountains around the\r\nformer is made up of a number of ranges, which dovetail together at the\r\nends, making a unit, but only a rude circle, speaking with mathematical\r\nexactness. The inclosed basin is only relatively a lowland; it is\r\nrigid with hills and low mountains, yet of such little importance, in\r\ncomparison with the rim of peaks, that the common name, the “Bohemian\r\nKettle,” has begun to have an accredited significance, and is stronger\r\nthan the more loosely-used word Basin. Transylvania, too, partakes of\r\nsimilar characteristics. Its border consists of a number of minor ranges,\r\nof varying heights, up to 1800 feet; and the central hollow, which is\r\nmuch more strongly marked by hilly land than Bohemia, lies 2200 feet\r\nabove the Adriatic. The ring-shaped system is one of the rarest met of\r\nall. They are, however, observed in abundance on the moon.\r\n\r\n5. Just as rare is the form where ranges intersect in the form of a\r\ncross, those running, for example, from north to south, meeting those\r\nrunning east and west. As an instance of this, Humboldt cites the\r\nconfluence of the Himalaya, the Kuenlun, the Hindoo Koosh, and the\r\nBelor or Belurtagh Mountains. The belt between 35° and 40° N. lat.\r\nis remarkable for its gridiron-shaped mountain system, the points of\r\nconjunction being marked by knots of peaks of colossal height. The most\r\nremarkable one of these is the lofty Pamir Pass, between 37° 30′ and 40°\r\n5′ N. lat., and 18,000 feet high, known, historically, from the sixth\r\ncentury, and described by Marco Polo, as well as by the ancient Greek\r\nhistorians. The Persians dwelling in the neighborhood term it the Roof of\r\nthe World. Elsewhere the same feature is observable, though on a scale\r\nof less magnitude. So in the Altai range at Lake Yetzkoi, in the western\r\nSwiss Alps, and in the porphyritic chain of Room-Elee, known to the\r\nancients as Rhodope, and now as the Despoto Dagh. This gridiron-shape of\r\nsome mountain systems seems to be the result of upheavals at different\r\ntimes, which necessarily occasions the most broken configuration at the\r\npoint where a chain of more recent formation has been projected through\r\none of older date.\r\n\r\nThe varying relations of length, breadth, direction, connection, and\r\nseverance of mountain ranges give great diversity to them, and impart\r\nto every system a character of its own. To the features just indicated\r\nmust be added vertical or precipitous descents, for the influences which\r\nthey exert upon the possibility of man’s constructing mountain roads, are\r\nvery great. The extent of these sudden depressions, or, more exactly,\r\nthe relation which the distance from the base to the pass bears to the\r\ndistance from the base to the summit, gives a key to the uses of certain\r\nmountains as adjuncts of civilization, and shows how some ranges rather\r\nthan others may become the abode of men, and produce marked effects on\r\nhuman culture and the world’s history.\r\n\r\nI have before alluded to the comb-like structure of most mountain\r\nchains. The resemblance is more striking than may appear; for not only\r\ndo the peaks correspond in general uniformity of height with the teeth\r\nof the comb, but the equally uniform height of the passes from the base\r\ncorresponds with the uniform thickness of the solid part of the comb.\r\nThe relation, however, of the distance from the base to the passes, to\r\nthe distance from the base to the peaks, is widely various. Humboldt has\r\nestimated it in a few leading chains as follows:—\r\n\r\n    Himalayas.\r\n    Height of chain, 25,000 ft.\r\n      ”       pass,  15,000 ”\r\n      ”       base,    1000 ” (Delhi.)\r\n\r\n    Alps.\r\n    Mont Blanc,      14,500 ft.\r\n    Height of pass,    7200 ”\r\n      ”       base,    1200 ”\r\n\r\n    Andes.\r\n    Chimborazo,      21,000 ft.\r\n    Height of pass,  10,000 ”\r\n      ”       base,             (Sea.)\r\n\r\n    Pyrenees.\r\n    Maladetta,       10,722 ft.\r\n    Height of pass,    8000 ”\r\n      ”       base,             (Sea.)\r\n\r\nIn the Alps and Caucasus the relation of the height of the pass to the\r\nheight of the chain is as 1 to 2; in the Himalaya, Quito Cordillera,\r\nand Alleghany Mountains, as 1 to 1·8; in the Pyrenees and Cordillera of\r\nBolivia, as 1 to 1·5. In the Alps, therefore, where the pass is only half\r\nas elevated as the chain, the communication is the most direct, and the\r\nleast barrier is put to the purposes of man,—a fact of great import in\r\nrelation to human culture. The Pyrenees are in direct contrast in this\r\nrespect, the most unapproachable, the most sundering of mountains.\r\n\r\nThe position of mountain chains is a matter of the first importance in\r\nrelation to the welfare of man, and the solution of many of the most\r\nimportant problems in history. Whether interior ranges like the Ural and\r\nthe Atlas, or ranges connecting two seas like the Caucasus, or those\r\nlike the Mexican Sierras, lying between two oceans, are most open to\r\nhuman approach and use, is a question which we will not here stop to\r\nconsider; but it may be said that, whether situated in the relations\r\njust indicated, or whether they are meridianal ranges like the Ural, the\r\nScandinavian chain, the Alleghanies, or the great Cordillera of both\r\nAmericas, which extends from the tropical world to both polar zones; or\r\nwhether they run in the same direction with the parallels of latitude,\r\nturning one side to the colder north, and another side to the sunnier\r\nsouth; or whether they assume a diagonal direction like the Swiss Alps,\r\nfrom southwest to northeast, or like the Caucasus, from northwest to\r\nsoutheast, is a matter of the first importance to ascertain. Of not less\r\nconsequence is it to discover whether the chain is the edge or rim of a\r\nplateau, and can have, therefore, only a one-sided development, like the\r\nHimalayas toward the south, or the Anti-Taurus toward the north, because\r\nthe existence of a plateau on the reverse side dwarfs the slant distance,\r\nand gives but a fractional part of what, without the plateau, would be\r\nopen and clear.\r\n\r\nAs plateaus usually display this edge on both sides, the border has\r\nbeen aptly compared to a double ledge or rim, between the two sides of\r\nwhich the table-land lies, often tolerably high above the sea level. If\r\nthese rims, like mountains, are not contiguous to the plateau; if they\r\nare separated from it by a valley of greater or less width and depth,\r\nrunning parallel with the edge, they form what Humboldt has called\r\nnatural circumvallations. Of such the Altai range, on the north side of\r\nthe Asiatic central plateau, is an example. The hollow between the range\r\nand the plateau just mentioned is partly filled with inland seas. The\r\nCaucasus may, in like manner, be regarded as the circumvallation of the\r\nAmerican plateau, separate from it by the Koor and the Aras (ancient\r\nAraxes) rims. Yet in the Caucasus another modification occurs—a partial\r\nlinking of the plateau with the range at the west extremity, by the\r\nconnecting chain of the Moschic Mountains. In like manner the Pyrenees,\r\nin their eastern half, form a circumvallation around the north side of\r\nthe Castilian plateau, separated from it by the basin of the Ebro, and\r\nforming a perfect ring around Upper Castile and the elevated province of\r\nBiscay.\r\n\r\nIn cases where a mountain chain rests upon a plateau, rising up in the\r\nvery heart of it, its summits seem to be not high, although the basis,\r\nthe true foot of the chain, may not be at the level of the plateau,\r\nbut far lower, and such mountains may, therefore, be of great absolute\r\nheight. The name superimposed mountains has been given to them. Such are\r\nthe Kuenlun and the Thian-Shan ranges of Central Asia, the Guadarrama\r\nchain between Old and New Castile, and the Rocky Mountains in North\r\nAmerica. These superimposed ranges often run near to and parallel with\r\nthe rim or edge of the plateau, and seem to give it more completeness and\r\nbreadth.\r\n\r\nThe geologist employs the word “sutures” to designate such forms, because\r\nthey serve to unite those parts of a plateau which are at different\r\nheights above the sea level. He regards the mountains as rising to fill\r\nenormous clefts which great convulsions have rent in the earth, and as\r\npassing up, while in their fluid state, to a height above the level of\r\nthe plateau, and bridging over the abyss. In this way our mountains which\r\nrest on plateaus seem to have been formed, as indeed is indicated by\r\ntheir geological structure.\r\n\r\nThe smaller plateaus display analogies kindred to those seen in the\r\nlarger superimposed mountain ranges. The extinguished volcanic group\r\nof Auvergne rests upon the central plateau of southern France, which,\r\naccording to Remond, has an average elevation of 1000 feet. The now\r\nsilent volcanic group of the northern Rhine broke through the moderately\r\nelevated gray-wacke formation of that locality, and is, therefore, a\r\nsuperimposed range.\r\n\r\nMountain chains which diverge from plateaus and their serrated rims seem,\r\nnevertheless, to have some relation to them, even though they cannot be\r\nconsidered continuations of them. The Lebanon chain, for instance, which\r\nturns away at a right angle from the Taurus range, and runs southward\r\nthrough Syria and Palestine; the Lutznetskia and the Alatau Mountains,\r\nmineral ranges running from the Altai northward to Tomsk; the Yablonoi\r\nand the Stanovoi Chrabet ranges running to the northeast; the still\r\nunknown or little known range of Farther India, traversing the whole\r\npeninsula of Malacca, come under this head.\r\n\r\nCompletely unlike the groups thus far considered, are the isolated\r\nmountain systems, with uniform slopes on all sides, and with a roof-like\r\nform, distinguishable to the base. The mountains of Europe are mostly\r\nof this class—the Ural, Carpathian, Scandinavian ranges, the Alps,\r\nApennines, and, in part, the Pyrenees. They give rise to rivers, not\r\non one side alone, as do the Himalayas and the Andes; they are rich\r\nin resources of all kinds for the student and the economist, and thus\r\nmake up in part for their comparatively unimportant dimensions. Their\r\ndouble-sidedness gives them a large influence on civilization, since\r\nrivers flow from them in all directions; while from the Himalayas they\r\nonly flow to the south, and from the Andes to the east.\r\n\r\nPlateaus and mountains, different as they are in appearance and\r\ncharacteristics, yet constitute, in their mutual action and reaction,\r\nand in their forms of transition from the one to the other, the highland\r\nsystem of the globe. Their relations are inexhaustible as Nature herself.\r\nWe cannot study them without profit; but we can never come to a perfect\r\nknowledge of them all.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Relations of Plateau Systems.\r\n\r\nLike mountain systems, plateaus are not to be estimated in respect to\r\nelevated and superficial area alone, but in respect to form and position\r\nas well.\r\n\r\nThe American plateaus are elongated from north to south, but are of\r\ndisproportionate breadth from east to west. The Asiatic plateaus, on the\r\ncontrary, are not only of great length, but also of great breadth. The\r\nSpanish plateau, that of the Atlas system, and that of Asia Minor have\r\ntheir length and breadth nearly equal.\r\n\r\nThe surface of plateaus is exceedingly varied. It sometimes assumes\r\nthe aspect of elevated plains, sometimes of rolling land, sometimes\r\nof horizontal strata of naked rock, as in Patagonia and the western\r\nSahara. In one place it displays sand-hills, as in parts of the Gobi\r\nDesert; in others barren steppes, as in portions of Persia. Sometimes we\r\nfind a gradual ascent of minor plateaus or terraces; sometimes single\r\nmountains rising out of the plateaus, as does Demavend; sometimes we find\r\na chain of colossal peaks emerging from the heart of a plateau, like\r\nThian-Shan and Bogdo-Oola. Sometimes there are plateaus broken up into\r\ncrags and patches of level ground, like Persia; sometimes plateaus with\r\ndeep valleys or river basins, like the plateau of Yoorkistan and Gobi,\r\nincluding the River Tarim, and reaching its greatest depression at Lake\r\nLop, or, like the plateau of Afghanistan, including the River Hirmend\r\nand Lake Zareh; again, we have plateaus traversed by water-courses which\r\nforced their way in times of flood, and leave in the rainless seasons\r\nthe traces of the former violence. Such are some of the less elevated\r\nplateaus of France and Bavaria.\r\n\r\nEspecially important are the combinations and groupings of plateaus, as\r\nwell as their relation to adjacent lowlands.\r\n\r\nIn Africa the plateau form embraces the larger southern half of the\r\ncontinent. Low plains are, on the contrary, the prevailing form in the\r\nnorth, broken, however, by the Sahara, and the high coast plateaus of the\r\nAtlas range, and of Barca.\r\n\r\nIn Asia there is a vast central plateau with gradual declivities toward\r\nthe east, toward Yoorkistan and Persia on the west, and toward Lakes\r\nBaikal and Zaisan on the north. On the south the descent is abrupt to the\r\nIndian lowlands.\r\n\r\nIn Europe there are, for the most part, scattered and disconnected\r\nplateaus of small size and little elevation, often passing by an\r\nimperceptible gradation to the other forms. The Spanish plateau is,\r\nhowever, a marked exception, and has the sharply-defined character of the\r\nnorthern African plateaus. In eastern Europe the central situation of the\r\nisolated Valdai plateau, whose elevation is very moderate, but 840 to\r\n1080 feet, is remarkable, and is of very great influence in determining\r\nthe hydrographical character of the great Russian lowlands. And in fact,\r\nthe hydrographical influence of both mountains and plateaus is so great,\r\nthat it is worthy of careful and special study.\r\n\r\nThe combinating and grouping of plateaus in different continents give\r\nrise to great contrasts, observable most distinctly in Asia and America.\r\n\r\nAsia, with all its great internal depression from Cashgar to Lake Lop,\r\nyet displays such immense districts of plateaus, all ranges of elevation,\r\nlow, moderate, and very great, that the very grandeur and extent of its\r\ncolossal mountain chains are subordinate in comparison. Asia is the land\r\npre-eminently of plateaus.\r\n\r\nAmerica displays, not in its central but on its western coast, the\r\ngreatest chain of mountains on the globe, flanked by plateaus of great\r\nelevation, but of superficial area quite out of proportion to the length\r\nof the mountain chain, and to the extent of the lowlands of both the\r\nnorthern and the southern divisions. And while in Africa the regions of\r\ndepression are in the north, and in Asia around the great central plateau\r\nsystem, in the Americas, both North and South, they are thrown into the\r\neastern portion.\r\n\r\nAustralia, in perfect contrast again, is, with the exception of its\r\nsoutheastern corner, a vast tract of unbroken lowland. No diversity is\r\npossible there, no change in the condition of life, but a ceaseless\r\nuniformity of monotonous but prodigal gifts.\r\n\r\nIs not the imposing grandeur of these harmonious, provisional\r\narrangements for the use of man calculated to fill the soul with admiring\r\nwonder, and to lead us to suspect, above all this display of cause and\r\neffect, above all this working out of a manifestly preconceived plan,\r\nthe existence of a great and active Being, who has planned and executed\r\nit all with higher ends and a loftier purpose than to satisfy the mere\r\nearthly life of man?\r\n\r\n\r\nPrimeval Formation of Plateaus and Mountains.\r\n\r\nTo enter upon a discussion of the manner in which plateaus and mountains\r\nwere formed, would make it necessary to resort to such judgments as we\r\ncould draw from their external appearance and their internal structure.\r\nThe rapid progress of geology does indeed afford us many probabilities\r\nthoroughly grounded. A few of these may have been briefly indicated in\r\nconnection with some elevated regions, where the massiveness is striking,\r\nand where the axis of elevation is prolonged to a considerable extent.\r\nIn such cases the influence exerted on the world is more evident than it\r\ncould be elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Origin of Plateaus._\r\n\r\nAlexander von Humboldt has employed the term Intumescence, to indicate\r\nthe manner in which plateaus have been upheaved. Plateaus appear as long,\r\noften wide, mostly level, sometimes rolling, sometimes hilly elevations,\r\npresenting an appearance as if the earth had swelled with confined gases,\r\nand with depressions here and there as if, in the casting of the molten\r\nmass within, a natural external subsidence had followed. They have,\r\ntherefore, viewed in their internal structure, an unbroken wholeness, and\r\nare free from those vast fissures which characterize mountains, rending\r\nthe earth for hundreds of feet down. The utmost want of uniformity is\r\nseen in the gradual depressions which often harbor the large internal\r\nlakes found in great plateaus. Varied as they are in configuration, they\r\nalways retain marks enough to indicate that they owe their upheaval to\r\nsteady, gentle, and not tumultuous forces within, exerted at the time of\r\nthe primeval cooling of the earth’s crust; in contrast, therefore, with\r\nmountains, which were thrust up from beneath, through huge seams made\r\nby the bursting through of pent-up vapor and gases. These elevations\r\nof the earth’s crust, whether in the form of mountain or plateau, must\r\ncorrespond, in order that the symmetry of the globe may be preserved, to\r\nthe depressions found in lowlands and beneath the water of oceans and\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nIt is observable that the great plateau upheaval of the Old World has\r\ntaken the shape of a belt, which runs in a northeasterly direction along\r\nits whole southeastern shore, crossing the equator at an angle of 45°,\r\nbroken, however, at some places, but never so much as to destroy the\r\ncoherence of the belt. The diagonal of the rhomboidal plateau of eastern\r\nAsia, passing due northeast through the table-land of Thibet, indicates\r\nthe direction of the whole band of highlands. This band drops toward the\r\nsouth in uniformly steep declivities; while toward the north it falls\r\naway with gradual steps of transition, reaching at length the regions of\r\nthe greatest depression—Libya, northern Arabia, the Caspian, Siberia,\r\nand, at last, the low regions around the north pole.\r\n\r\nIn this belt or chaplet of plateaus lie the high table-lands of South\r\nand Northeast Africa, Abyssinia, South Arabia, Persia, Beloochistan,\r\nNorth Deccan, Afghanistan, Thibet, East Tangut, and eastern Gobi, in\r\nMantchooria.\r\n\r\nCorrespondent with this immense plateau belt, in the New World, is the\r\ngreat American chain, once a wholly volcanic, and though differing so\r\nmuch in structure, direction, and hydrographical influence, yet giving\r\nthe globe a wholeness, a unity in diversity, which is strikingly apparent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Origin of Mountains._\r\n\r\nThe linear regions of elevations of the earth’s surface, as we may term\r\nthem, in contradistinction to the plateaus which are characterized\r\nby breadth rather than by length, have been projected in the form of\r\nmountain chains, as has been already hinted, through huge fissures made\r\nby the rending of the earth’s crust. The upheaval to fill the seam has,\r\nin some cases, been all made at once; in others, in a succession of\r\nperiods. The uniform agreement of all the geological strata or their\r\ndiversity decides this point. Sometimes the rocky strata are laid bare\r\nand easily investigated. Often, however, the observer is obliged to draw\r\nconclusions from a part to the whole. Yet in all cases the mountain, in\r\ncontradistinction to the adjacent plateau, is the tract which has been\r\nthrust through the crust. The frequent steep and lofty precipices show\r\nthe immensity of the internal force required to lift the mountains from\r\ntheir places, while the lines of stratification indicate the direction\r\nof upheaval. The rifting of a seam in the earth’s crust was the first\r\nstep in the formation of mountains; the filling up of the seam by\r\nliquid matter, the second step. The upheaval of Asia, from the Persian\r\nplateau to Gobi, in a line 60° N. E., seems to be connected with the\r\nmost ancient revolution which the earth’s crust ever experienced. The\r\nmountains there are, therefore, more modern in origin than the plateau\r\non which they stand. The direction of the chain, in all cases, seems\r\nto have been dependent on the direction of the fissure in the earth’s\r\ncrust, which the mountain range afterward fills. The breaking through\r\nthe crust necessarily occurred when the pressure beneath the surface was\r\nvery great, or when a moderate pressure was exerted beneath a thin crust,\r\nwhere the resistance was slight.\r\n\r\nThe latter case seems to have been prevalent in most plateau regions.\r\nTheir own gradual upheaval probably thinned the surface, and made it\r\nmore liable to fracture. This accounts for the fact that the greatest\r\nmountains of the globe are found contiguous to plateaus. And the broader\r\nthe original seam in the crust was, the broader the mountain range\r\nwhich rose to fill it, either at a single upheaval, or in a series of\r\nconvulsive throes projecting successive masses of molten matter from\r\nbelow. In the latter cases the strata thus formed lie on each other\r\nlike the leaves of a book, their constitution changing according as the\r\nmore advanced stages of melting in the vast internal caldron throw out\r\nmore metamorphosed rocks. These later layers rose to a greater or less\r\nheight on the sides of the partially-formed mountain, according to their\r\nspecific gravity, their more or less fluid state, and their rapidity\r\nof cooling, as we can now see by examining the layers in their present\r\npermanent condition.\r\n\r\nThus far we can conjecture, with great security, taught by the manifestly\r\nwild and fierce convulsions which once threw up the mountains, since in\r\nthem distortion is the rule and regularity of structure the exception,\r\nand also by the equally manifest quiet and sustained process of\r\nupheaval, when the plateaus were formed; their strata being in a state\r\nof regularity and unbroken repose.\r\n\r\nWhen the great vents produced by the outward pressure of internal\r\nvolcanic forces occurred beneath the sea, they were filled up in the same\r\nmanner as on the dry land, excepting that the summits of the mountains\r\nemerge above the surface in the form of isolated islands, or when there\r\nwas a chain or group of mountains upheaved, as an archipelago. When there\r\nwas no rifting of the surface, and no forcing up of whole chains of peaks\r\nthrough a thinned crust, the fierce action of the internal heat appears\r\nto have necessitated the upheaval of solitary volcanoes here and there,\r\nin some cases even rows of them, to give vent to the pent-up steam and\r\ngases, and to convey away the molten tide within. When such volcanic\r\nseries rose in parallel ranges, they lifted, or may have lifted up the\r\nwhole district between them, as if upon their shoulders, and so formed\r\nthe American type of plateaus, of less breadth and greater length than\r\nthe Asiatic, and in height corresponding with the volcanic peaks which\r\nform their rim, and to which they are probably indebted for the form of\r\ntheir structure.\r\n\r\nIt needs hardly to be added to what has been said above, that the general\r\ndirection of existing mountain chains depends upon the direction of the\r\nprimitive seams made in the earth’s surface by internal forces. The Ural\r\nMountains, the Scandinavian chain, the Alleghanies, the Ghauts, run on\r\nmeridian lines; others more or less transversely.\r\n\r\nThe various kinds of rock which have been thrown up in mountains\r\nenlighten us as to the process and results of the internal heat of the\r\nearth; the successive formations display not only the various eruptions\r\nof molten matter, and its discharge in new layers above what had been\r\nthrown out before, but reveal the relative age of the various formations.\r\nWe have in a single chain sometimes a whole volume of history, marking\r\noff the epochs of upheaval with the most perfect legibility and\r\nexactness. Many crystallised rocks result evidently from the gradual\r\nprocess of cooling after the ancient exposure to the intense heat of the\r\ninner portions of the earth—granite, porphyry, gneiss, slates, and the\r\nso-called metamorphosed rocks. These used to be considered the oldest\r\nformations, but the upheaval theory treats them as the latest formed.\r\n\r\nMost mountain chains have been uplifted to their present height by a\r\nsuccession of upheavals. To accomplish this has been labor of uncounted\r\nthousands of years. Only a very few—the main Carpathian range, for\r\ninstance—seem to have been upheaved at a single convulsion, and to have\r\nassumed their present appearance at once. Where there were incessant\r\neruptions accompanied with flames, and masses of molten matter (lava)\r\nhave been ejected from the crest or from single summits, these volcanoes\r\nand volcanic ranges have been the result. Elsewhere no such phenomena\r\nhave been visible. Possibly, in such cases, the masses cooled so rapidly\r\nas to extinguish or fill up what may have been embryo craters, and the\r\nplutonic acclivities may have been repressed, leaving us the traces of\r\nprimeval eruptions, but no vestiges of any dangerous forces remaining\r\ntill now. Of mountains formed in this manner, may be mentioned the Puys\r\nde Dome, the Bohemian basaltic peaks, trachyte Transylvania Alps, the\r\nKatak Kaumene, (“Burnt Tract,”) of Asia Minor, and Hauran, Iceland,\r\nparts of the great American chain, parts of the Sunda chain, the South\r\nSea Islands, and Bagdoola, and its range of extinct volcanoes in the\r\nThian-Shan chain.\r\n\r\nBut other forces besides fire were competent to form mountains and\r\nplateaus, to spread layers of clay and sand and various deposits at\r\nthe bottom of the sea, afterward to harden into strata of rock. In\r\ncontradistinction to plutonic formations, these have been called\r\nneptunic, because formed at the bottom of the sea. The oldest of the\r\nneptunic or stratified rocks have been upheaved by the subterranean\r\nforces, and now are found in the elevated plateaus or mountain ranges,\r\nstill having, however, their unbroken irregularity of structure. Also,\r\nafter the stratification has been complete, and plutonic acclivities have\r\nopened the seams in the earth of which I have already spoken, and molten\r\nmasses have rushed up to fill them, fragments of the primitive stratified\r\nrocks have been caught up and raised, together with the molten masses, to\r\nthe very summits of lofty mountains; so that the geologist finds fossils\r\nthere more or less perfectly preserved, the stratified rocks which\r\ncontain them surrounded by the plutonic rock upheaved from below the\r\nsurface. Chalk layers full of mollusca and infusoria have been found by\r\nHumboldt and von Buch on the very summits of the Andes, and corresponding\r\nwith those which have been discovered by Ehrenburg in the deposits at the\r\nbottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nOther older and more recent oceanic deposits are found in their primitive\r\ncondition at the bottom of the sea, or in very low places on the land.\r\nIn such localities the surface of the earth is composed of horizontal or\r\nslightly inclined layers or strata, of secondary formation, and whose\r\norigin in deposits from water cannot be denied. These are the beds\r\nof chalk, clay, sand, marl, gypsum, and other common substances; and\r\nthese strata again have been overlaid with more recent accumulations,\r\nthe result of diluvium or alluvium, continuing even up to the present\r\ntime.[5]\r\n\r\n\r\nLowlands.\r\n\r\nThis variety of the earth’s surface stands in the strongest contrast with\r\nmountain regions, or, in one word, with the highland form in all its\r\nmodifications. The name lowland we apply to all those broad tracts which\r\ndo not rise more than four hundred feet above the level of the sea. The\r\nabsolute elevation is determined from a section drawn vertically from the\r\nsuperior surface to the plane of the sea. Every comparison by numbers\r\nof one lowland plain with its more elevated surroundings gives only a\r\nrelative result, as for instance, in comparing the valleys of one chain\r\nof mountains with those of a more lofty chain. Such relative lowlands\r\nmay lie at a great elevation above the sea, as the vale of Chamouni, for\r\nexample, at the north foot of Mont Blanc, is 3000 feet above the ocean\r\nlevel. Both conceptions of the word lowland, which is common to elevated\r\nplains as well as those at the sea’s margin, are entirely different, and\r\nshould be kept distinct, although they are very often confounded.\r\n\r\nWe are to deal here only with the absolute, great, and generally diffused\r\nlowlands, in contrast with which the elevated valleys and plains just\r\nreferred to may be considered as mountain table-lands and the rims of\r\nplateaus.\r\n\r\nWe assume, as we did in judging of the two grades of plateaus, an\r\narbitrary standard of measurement, and limit the rise of real lowlands\r\nto an altitude of 500 feet above the level of the sea. Great tracts of\r\nrunning plain, rising by so slight a grade as to be almost imperceptible,\r\ncan be regarded only relatively as lowland, and, in a strict sense,\r\nbelong to those regions of transition which fall more truly within the\r\ndomain of highland or plateau. The word plain indicates the opposite of\r\nhill or mountain, but has nothing to do with the greater or less degree\r\nof absolute elevation, although it is often used as if it had.\r\n\r\nThe lower limits of lowlands are sharply defined enough. They are\r\nthe margin of the sea, toward which the slope usually becomes almost\r\nimperceptibly small. Often the expression is used, yet not quite fitly,\r\nthat the lowland extends into the sea for some distance, and is found\r\nbeneath the surface. Strictly this is the bottom of the sea, and does not\r\nfall under consideration in this connection.\r\n\r\nMany lowland plains rise so slightly above the sea level, that they are\r\nnot unfrequently submerged, and, in many cases, owe their existence to\r\nrepeated overflows. They are the basins of old gulfs, as in the very\r\nslightly elevated plains of Caracas, whose whole shore is open to the\r\ninfluences of the great Atlantic current flowing from east to west;\r\nor, as in the great Lombardy plain, which slopes at the same almost\r\nimperceptible degree toward the Adriatic. There are also some lowlands\r\nfound in the interior of continents, and these, too, sinking below the\r\nlevel of the sea; but they are altogether exceptional, and only met with\r\nin two or three instances. They are called, by an accommodation of an\r\nalgebraic term, _negative_ lowlands. To them belong the region around the\r\nCaspian and the Aral Seas, and the much smaller tract comprising the Dead\r\nSea, and forming the Jordan valley; besides, there is the Suez steppe,\r\ninclosing the bitter lakes between Asia and Africa; and possibly the\r\nBeled-el-Jereed, in the western part of the Sahara and the central part\r\nof Australia.\r\n\r\nTo these it might not be incorrect to join those partial lowlands which\r\nhave been rescued by human efforts from the sea; the marshes, for\r\ninstance, behind the dikes of Holland, Sleswick, East Friesland, and at\r\nthe mouths of the Vistula, the Weser, the Nile, the Ganges, and other\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nThe most extensive lowlands in the world are probably those which embrace\r\nSiberia, in Asia, and the Canadian and polar region of North America.\r\nMany great tracts, entirely inland, are in those flat districts covered\r\nby sea-water which was once driven in by great storms, and now lies\r\nstagnant, resulting in inapproachable swamps and morasses. Yet, under the\r\nequator, there are immense lowlands, as, for instance, in the eastern\r\nSahara, although this region is broken by strips of plateau, and is by no\r\nmeans that uniform lowland plain which it used to be regarded. Northern\r\nAustralia belongs to the same category, and also those immense plains\r\nwhich reach from the Atlantic so far into the interior of Brazil, along\r\nthe lower Amazon. By the time, however, that they reach the middle course\r\nof that river, they have acquired, though in such imperceptible steps, a\r\nconsiderable degree of elevation, according to Humboldt’s barometrical\r\nobservations, and not reckoning certain limestone hills found there,\r\nfrom 1050 to 1200 feet. The plains of the middle Marañon are, therefore,\r\ntrue plains, but not absolute lowlands, and not to be identified with\r\nthe great flat region at the mouth of the river, and in comparison with\r\nthe real lowlands of Venezuela, which do not rise over 200 feet above the\r\nsea, and genuine plateau, which, level as it is and broad as it is, is\r\nfar more elevated than the Valdai plateau, in Russia.\r\n\r\nAlmost all great river mouths are true lowlands—the Egyptian delta, the\r\ndelta of the Ganges and the Indus, for instance, (the two latter being\r\nseparated by the very moderate plateau (100 feet) between Delhi and\r\nMooltan;) to these we may add the delta of the Euphrates, the east shore\r\nof China, between the Blue and the Yellow Rivers, and Senegambia, between\r\nthe Senegal and the Gambia. And in America, the same thing occurs in the\r\nMississippi, Orinoco, Amazon, and La Plata, where the immense mass of\r\nwater which they send to the sea passes through lowlands of very great\r\nextent. In the Mississippi they extend from the mouth as far north as the\r\nconfluence of the Missouri and the Mississippi, where stands St. Louis,\r\nnot 500 feet above the level of the sea. The prairies west of the lower\r\ncourse of the river rise rapidly, though imperceptibly to the eye, to the\r\nhigh terraces of Kansas, at Council Grove, varying from 1500 to 2000 feet\r\nabsolute elevation, and then more rapidly toward the west, to mountain\r\nplains or plateaus, from 3000 to 6000 feet high. These, of course, lose\r\nthe distinctive character of lowland.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the St. Lawrence is, in some respects, analogous. Lowlands\r\naccompany it for a great distance from the sea; at Lake Ontario the\r\nelevation is only 232 feet, at Lake Erie only 565 feet. Yet the level\r\ntract is narrowed down to a mere border, and does not widen into great\r\nlowland plains. The contracted region of low country along the St.\r\nLawrence is broken up, too, by rocky heights and rib-like ledges, whose\r\nabsolute height, however, is not to be confounded with the elevation of\r\nthe plain which they traverse.\r\n\r\nIn entire contrast are the broad plains of South America, which lie\r\nalong the course of the Orinoco, La Plata, and Amazon, the so-called\r\npampas and savannas, which extend a great distance into the interior,\r\nfarther, indeed, than investigators have yet thoroughly prosecuted\r\ntheir researches. In no continent are the distinctions between highland\r\nand lowland so sharply drawn as in America. The lowland plains occupy\r\nfour-fifths of all the country east of the Andes, in South America: only\r\none-fifth is highland; for, notwithstanding the extent of low plateaus\r\nand diminutive mountains scattered through these great plains, yet their\r\nentire amount is inconsiderable, compared with the immense lowland\r\ntracts of that continent. America has fitly been called the region of\r\nthe greatest depression on the globe, because this is the prevailing\r\ncharacteristic of its whole eastern side, lowlands forming two-thirds of\r\nall America, and highlands only one-third.\r\n\r\nIn Asia, the later hypsometrical observations have shown that the\r\nlowlands are by no means so extensive as they were formerly supposed. The\r\nhighland extends, according to von Middendorf, much farther northeast of\r\nthe Yenisei, toward the northern limit of Siberia and Tschatschi, than\r\nwas formerly supposed; and the Siberian plain extending westward to the\r\nUral Mountains is narrowed down from 4,079,970 to 2,233,800 square miles.\r\nYet this lowland comprises, including central Bokhara or Toorkistan,\r\n1,051,200 square miles, and other low Asiatic plains 1,314,000, the\r\nenormous area of 4,599,000, or more than twice the extent of Europe,\r\nleaving 9,636,000 square miles for the highlands.\r\n\r\nIn Africa there are almost no lowlands to speak of, excepting the\r\ndistricts around the mouths of the great rivers indicated a few pages\r\nback. To all equatorial Africa this physical feature is entirely wanting.\r\nIn the north, where the whole Sahara was formerly thought to be one\r\nvast low plain, there are now known to be the moderate plateaus already\r\nindicated. The area of true lowland is, therefore, sensibly diminished.\r\nVogel’s barometrical observations have already shown us that the country\r\naround Lake Tchad is about 1200 feet above the sea; the surface of Lake\r\nTchad is 850 feet above the ocean level, and the lower limit of that\r\nregion does not, therefore, come within the range already set as the\r\npoint where lowlands become highlands.\r\n\r\nIn Australia the lowland seems to be the prevailing physical form,\r\nalthough here and there exceptions to it occur.\r\n\r\nIn Europe there are three great lowland plains to be specially mentioned.\r\nThe greatest, that of middle Europe, embraces the shores of the North\r\nSea and the Baltic far inland, and extend the farthest to the southeast.\r\nA second, hardly of less extensive proportions, comprises all northern\r\nRussia as far as the White Sea and the Arctic. It embraces but one-third\r\nof the great polar plain, and is really one with the region beyond the\r\nUral chain. The third is the region around the Black and Caspian Seas.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Middle European Lowlands.\r\n\r\nThe Germanic-Sarmatia-Russian plain extends, without a break, from the\r\nmouths of the Rhine, through all central Europe, to the middle Volga\r\nand the Ural. It is pre-eminently a region of lowlands, without any\r\nelevations of importance, and having no change of level, except very\r\ngently undulating swells, and on the north and south margin plateaus\r\nwhich very seldom rise over 500 feet. It begins with the deltas of the\r\nRhine and the Scheldt, in Holland, passes through Lower Westphalia, Lower\r\nSaxony, the Marks, Lower Silesia, Lower Gallicia, and Poland, as far as\r\nthe upper Dnieper and the middle Volga. It extends up the Rhine as far as\r\nStrasbourg, 474 feet above the sea, up the Weser as far as Cassel, 486\r\nfeet, and up the Elbe as far as Dresden, 280 feet.\r\n\r\nThe true Rhine delta may be defined as lying between Amsterdam, on the\r\nsea, and Dusseldorf, 107 feet above the sea level. Then passing by\r\nthe broken and romantic tract lying between Dusseldorf or Cologne and\r\nMayence, we come to the true Rhenish lowland, 240 feet above the sea.\r\nMunster is 400 feet above the ocean level. East of the Weser is the\r\nLüneburg Heath, which advances in elevation, as we go toward the Elbe and\r\nthe Havel, to 300 or 400 feet. Brunswick lies at an altitude of 200 feet;\r\nMagdeburg, of 128 feet. The height gradually increases; at Wittenburg it\r\nreaches 204 feet; at Dresden 280 feet, where the Elbe issues from the\r\nhighlands; and in Lower Silesia we find Breslau, 375 feet above the sea,\r\nand its observatory, standing on the hills around the city, at a height\r\nof 453 feet, which seems to be the highest point in the whole vast tract.\r\n\r\nBetween the Rhine delta and the now dry basin of Paderborn, from the Ems\r\nto the Weser, Aller, and middle Elbe, is the mountain tract of the Hartz,\r\n(with the Brocken at the north, 3500 feet high,) running up as far as\r\n52½° N. lat. By this natural feature the breadth of the great plain is\r\nconsiderably curtailed. As it is also more to the east of the Leipsic\r\nbasin, from which the Mulde, Elbe, and Elster flow, by the hill country\r\nof Lausatia and North Silesia, with the Riesengeberge, (Giant Mountains,)\r\n5000 feet high, which extends northward as far as 51° N. lat.\r\n\r\nA third basin is in the Silesian, from which the Oder flows toward the\r\nnorthwest, and enters the southern limits of the great plain near Oppeln\r\nand Brieg. A third tract of hill country lies on the east bank of the\r\nOder, and extends to the middle Vistula, the Tarnowitz Heights, in Upper\r\nSilesia, about 1000 feet in altitude. The plateau north of the Carpathian\r\nrange, on which Cracow lies, is 669 feet above the sea; and the most\r\nnorthern hill group of Kielce, between the Pilica and the Vistula, rises\r\nin the Kreutzberg to a height of 1920 feet, and in St. Catherine to 2000\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe great lowland advances eastward, with always diminishing breadth\r\nfrom north to south, over the extensive plains of the middle Vistula,\r\nat Warsaw, 330 feet above the sea; over the Lithuanian morasses of the\r\nBug; over the Sarmatian district of Minsk and Pinsk as far as Kiev, on\r\nthe middle Dnieper, at the southeast, and as far as Orsha and Smolensk,\r\nat the northeast. Pinsk, in the middle of this tract, lies about 400\r\nfeet above the sea. The north side of the plain is bounded by the very\r\nmoderate plateau south of the Valdai hills, at Smolensk, 792 feet high;\r\nat Osmana, southeast of Minsk, 882 feet. On the south side it is bounded\r\nby the equally moderate plateau of Wolhynia and Podolia, whose absolute\r\naltitude is yet undetermined, but which, at the source of the Bug, is\r\nabout 1000 feet.\r\n\r\nThis is the great Lithuan-Sarmatian plain, which, east of the Dnieper,\r\nis transformed into the central Russian lowland, at whose middle point\r\nis Moscow, whose exact elevation above the sea is between 300 and 400\r\nfeet; at Kazan, on the Volga, the height above the ocean level is but\r\n270 feet, measuring from the highest point on the banks. Southward, the\r\nplain reaches to Simbeersk, 181 feet in altitude. The maximum breadth of\r\nthis whole vast lowland tract is about 500 miles; the distance between\r\nSmolensk and Kiev, and the distance from the central point of the great\r\nRussian section to any sea, is between 500 and 600 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Origin of the Great Central European Plain.\r\n\r\nThe slight elevation of the lowland just described, rising but very\r\nlittle above the sea level, bears, throughout the most of its extent\r\nbetween the dunes of the north and the hill chains of the south, the\r\ncharacter of a formation rescued from the domain of the sea within the\r\nvery latest geological periods. The almost unbroken uniformity of the\r\nsurface from the Scheldt to the Volga, about 2500 miles, confirms the\r\ncharacter which its geological structure indicates. The deposition of\r\ndisconnected, superimposed layers, running to a great depth, is exactly\r\nsimilar to that which we know results from the action now going on at the\r\nbottom of shallow seas. And in the great central European plain there is\r\nno sharply-defined geological limit met at the border of the North and\r\nthe Baltic Seas. The same features extend beneath the surface of both\r\nof those seas. This whole lowland is, therefore, to be regarded as an\r\nimmense basin, now dry, but once the bottom of a great sea,—an extension\r\nof the seas which now form a part of its northern border. The old coasts\r\nare now seen far inland. Wherever this coast-line changed its course, the\r\nwhole landscape now alters its appearance; and yet more striking than\r\nthe external view is the internal constitution of the soil. Masses of\r\nstone, standing out in full view, reveal the inner structure of what lies\r\nconcealed. And these rocky projections are precisely analogous to the\r\njagged outlines of our present bold sea-shores. The land is not cut up by\r\ninlets hollowed out by the action of waves and currents to a considerable\r\ndepth, yet traces of such movements, and of the physical formations\r\neffected by them, are found. Promontories and islands are now found\r\nin plateaus, and hills encompassing dry basins. To the latter belong\r\nthe intervale of the Rhine, and the basins of Paderborn, Leipsic, and\r\nSilesia. To the former belong the hills and plateaus of Middle Germany;\r\nof the Westphalian Mark, from Elberfeld to Dortmund, or, as might be\r\nsaid, from the Ruhr to the Lippe; the Yeutoburg Forest to the Weser; then\r\nthe Weser Mountains, and the Hartz to the middle Elbe; the Thuringian\r\nForest and the Ertz Mountains around the Leipsic basin to the upper Elbe;\r\nthe Lausatian Mountains and the Riesengeberge to the Glatz Mountains, on\r\nthe upper Oder; the Trebnitz Heights of Silesia, and the lower plateaus\r\nof the Fore Carpathian range, embracing Cracow as far as the hills of\r\nKielce and the confluence of the Sau with the Vistula. Along the southern\r\nborder of the ever-broadening plain are the plateaus of Gallicia, about\r\n1000 feet in height, of Wolhynia and Podolia, and then less elevated\r\nplateaus, till we reach the Dnieper.\r\n\r\nThe geological character of the border of the sea which once covered\r\nwhat is now central Europe, is full of interest, because from it can be\r\ndeduced all that we can know of the history of those great changes.[6]\r\nBut we must pass over this, and only indicate the geographical\r\nconfiguration of the dry basin as it exists now, and forms the great\r\nGermanic-Sarmatia-Russian plain.\r\n\r\nIn the course of previous remarks on the lowest range of plateaus, I\r\nhave remarked, that along the south coast of the Baltic the moderately\r\nelevated hill chains of Pomerania and of Old Prussia separated the true\r\ncoast with its lowland from the great interior plain, forming a barrier,\r\naveraging about 300 feet in height, with here and there a form which runs\r\nhard upon the lower limit of plateaus of the second class; at any rate, a\r\ntransition from between the lowland and the plateau.\r\n\r\nIt may here be remarked that the long, low chains, made up mainly of\r\nloose sand and other mixed and uncombined materials, and running along\r\nthe southern border of that long, low band which skirts the Baltic, seem\r\nto be dunes once running along the shore of a sea which has now receded\r\nmany miles to the north. In the deep channels and old inlets now dry, as\r\nfor instance in the great break through which the Vistula passes below\r\nThorn, only loose breccia, and no united layers of stone, appear. Yet\r\nthis does not seem to be the case everywhere, although in the Cis-Ural\r\nand Baltic depressions dune-like ridges are to be found, some of them\r\nrising to a height much greater than was formerly suspected. These, it\r\nis true, are scattered, and only partially prevalent, but here and there\r\nthey ascend to an altitude of nearly 1000 feet. At the eastern end of\r\nthe great Pomeranian sea-plain west of Dantzic, and between that city\r\nand Bütow, where the sand ridge, which formed the ancient shore-line,\r\nruns very far to the north, there are a number of villages 400 feet above\r\nthe sea. The Lower Mountain, (Thurmberg,) 54° 13′ 29″ N. lat., rises\r\nto a height of 1024 feet; the hill near Upper Buschkau, east of the\r\nThurmberg, is 814 feet high; the hill near Hulterfeld, 846 feet; and the\r\nHöckerberg, near Schönberg, 902 feet.\r\n\r\nOf the Thurmberg, Humboldt remarks that it is the most remarkable\r\nelevation between the Hartz and the Ural Mountains, and that but a few\r\npoints in the Valdai range can be brought into comparison with it. Its\r\nposition close by the sea is especially noteworthy. It is very probable,\r\naccording to Humboldt’s opinion, that those inequalities of surface,\r\nformed of sand once partly or wholly submerged,—found in Mecklenberg,\r\nPomerania, East Prussia Proper,—and now divided into flats and hill\r\nranges, do not belong to the dune system of the ancient shore-line, but\r\nhave the reason of their existence in ordinary upheaval; in the formation\r\nof limestone, and of the usual Jurassic rocks, which, afterward,\r\nhave been covered with sand and other loose materials. The peculiar\r\naccumulation of genuine marine fossils indicates the existence of\r\nupheaved rocks below the upper layer of sand.\r\n\r\nIt is these elevations which in the constantly advancing ridge or ridges\r\nrun northeasterly, and take the form of plateaus, increasing in breadth\r\nfrom the water-shed north of Smolensk, and the source of the Dnieper, in\r\nthe Valdai Forest, and the western Uwalli, and which are found between\r\nthe Volga and the Dwiner, and thence run eastward as far as Perm, on\r\nthe Kama. They form the line of demarkation between the great Central\r\nEuropean plain and the North Russian lowland, which extends as far up as\r\nthe Arctic. This easterly chain, so far as it has been measured, seems\r\nto be less in altitude than the Valdai hills, which are about 1000 feet\r\nhigh. In East Prussia Proper and Livonia there are elevations of more\r\nthan 600 feet; about 55 miles south of Dorpat Munnamäggi, the point of\r\nculmination, according to Struve, is 996 feet above the sea; south of\r\nVilna the heights of Puzewitch reach an elevation of 990 feet.\r\n\r\nIn the same direction, still northeast, runs the Valdai, forming the\r\nsource of a number of large streams and the great water-shed of eastern\r\nEurope. On the road from St. Petersburg to Moscow, Humboldt found the\r\naltitude at Norwaja Ijetza 660 feet, and the highest point at Popowa Gora\r\n792 feet, (according to Pausner, 876 feet.) One point going south from\r\nthe Valdai, at Mosti Derewna, the latter naturalist has ascertained to be\r\n1032 feet above the sea; and the highest point in the range is, according\r\nto Helmersen, 1098 feet. Still further eastward, between the Valdai hills\r\nand the lake region between Lake Seligher and Bielo Ozero, the range of\r\nuplands, known as Uwalli, running northwesterly, intersected by numerous\r\ncanals, and forming the water-shed of a number of rivers, gradually\r\ndiminishes in height, but, still advancing eastward, it rises again, in\r\nthe neighborhood of Perm and the Kama, to 1014 feet,—about the elevation\r\nof the Valdai range. Uwalli is only the Sclavic name of such hills as\r\nthose whose absolute height is insignificant, but which, crossing as\r\nthey do the great plains of Poland, Lithuania, and Russia, were formerly\r\nconfounded with mountain ranges, and were so represented on the maps.\r\nThey have, of course, great hydrographical value, and play a leading part\r\nas the water-shed of eastern Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ponto-Caspian Plain, the Great Depression of the Old World.\r\n\r\nThis second vast lowland is the direct continuation of the central\r\nEuropean lowland, with a decided sinking toward the Black and the Caspian\r\nSeas, indicated by the course of the rivers of that region. It extends\r\nfrom the month of the Danube over the lower Dniester, Bog, Dnieper,\r\nDon, and Volga, as far eastward as the Sea of Aral. To the last named\r\nthe Siberian plain gradually declines. The southern plain of Europe\r\nstands in unbroken connection, so far as its formation is concerned,\r\nwith the West Siberian plain, (2,213,400 square miles in extent,) and\r\nis, therefore, one of the most extensive lowlands on the globe. The\r\nBaltic-Sarmatian plain is separated from the West Siberian merely by the\r\nlong Ural chain, (from 50° to 67° N. lat.,) whose elevation is only from\r\n4000 to 5000 feet, and whose breadth is unimportant. Take away the Ural,\r\nand a continuous line could be drawn from Breda, near the confluence\r\nof the Meuse, Rhine, and Scheldt, across Europe and Asia, following\r\nthe line of 50° N. lat as far as the Chinese frontier, passing over a\r\ncontinuous series of low, insignificant hills, heathlands, and steppes,\r\nand traversing a space estimated by Humboldt to be three times the length\r\nof the Amazon!\r\n\r\nToward the south, the Cis-Ural, European side of the Ponto-Caspian\r\nlowland, is separated from the Black Sea by a ridge of granite knolls,\r\nwhich passes from Volhynia and Podolia eastward as far as the cataracts\r\nof the Dnieper, and thence southeast, with diminished breadth, reaching\r\nits limit at Taganrog, on the lower Don, and the Sea of Azof. This ridge\r\nseparates the narrow steppes of the northern shore of the Black Sea\r\nfrom the lowland of South Russia, the fruitful district of Ukraine. The\r\nheight of these hills in the west, where they appear to have the greatest\r\nelevation, has been estimated to be about 1000 feet above the sea. Toward\r\nthe Dnieper they have not yet been carefully measured; but probably there\r\nthey do not rise above 700 feet.\r\n\r\nThe small sand steppe south of these granite hills runs from the Crimea\r\neastward as far as the North Caucasian steppe, between the Don, Volga,\r\nand the Caspian, and indeed may be traced to the northeast as far as\r\nthe Bashkiric-Ural chain. Lakes of marked saltness are found there:\r\nElton, for instance, which lies 24 feet above the sea; while farther\r\neastward they are found, as for example on the Kamysh and at Samara at a\r\ndepression of—138 feet, 60 feet below the level of the Caspian Sea. Yet\r\nthis lacks confirmation.\r\n\r\nFrom this lowland, only a few elevations arise, and these of\r\ninsignificant absolute height; yet, on account of the extreme uniformity\r\nof the whole country, they are objects of amazement to the whole steppe\r\nworld. The Little Bogdo, south of Lake Elton, and yet farther south,\r\nGreat Bogdo, 504 feet above the sea, according to Humboldt, and Mount\r\nArsargar, 331 feet in absolute height, according to Murchison, are the\r\nonly important hills. The Great Bogdo is composed of calcareous limestone\r\nand of sandstone, with rich deposits of salt.\r\n\r\nThe Kirgheez steppe separates, by a plain of very moderate elevation, the\r\nnorth Siberian lowland from the Caspian-Ural depression. It was formerly\r\nsupposed, and indeed represented on the map, that a mountain range passes\r\nthrough this district from the Ural chain to the Altai. The Kirgheez\r\nsteppe appears to range from 780 to 960 feet in elevation; while the\r\nSiberian plain is but 280 feet above the sea at Omsk, 192 feet at Tora,\r\nand 108 feet at Tobolsk. It has been considered by some that the Kirgheez\r\nsteppe, as well as the granite hills of southern Russia, belong to an\r\nundeveloped system of mountains, an early cooling having solidified them\r\nbefore reaching the elevation which they would have attained; and that\r\nthey partake of the direction which analogy would teach us such a chain\r\nwould have, from northeast to southwest, parallel with the Carpathian and\r\nthe Caucasus ranges.\r\n\r\nThe great depression of the Old World begins with the deepening of\r\nthe Volga basin below Simbeersk; and at the place (51¾° N. lat., near\r\nOrenboorg and Saratov) where it breaks through the last row of hills in\r\nthe Obstshei-Syrtis, it commences a rapid descent toward the Caspian and\r\nthe Aral Seas. This great concavity, on the confines of Europe and Asia,\r\nat the center of the greatest land-mass, and far removed from any ocean,\r\nis remarkable as having no parallel on the globe. Humboldt remarks that\r\nperhaps a similar phenomenon would be repeated at the interior of other\r\ncontinents, if the tertiary formation and the parts found by marine\r\ndeposit did not exist. It would be profitable to follow out so weighty a\r\nthought, with the surface as it now is.\r\n\r\nThe Obstshei-Syrtis is the moderate range of hills which runs westward\r\nin two branches from the Bashkiric-Ural, at Orenboorg, the northern spur\r\nrunning by Uralsk and the Ural River; the southern by Samara, rising\r\non the east shore of the Volga to a height of 600 feet, and ending at\r\nSarepta.\r\n\r\nOrenboorg, on the Obstshei-Syrtis, where it leaves the Ural chain, is 255\r\nfeet above the sea. Uralsk lies somewhat lower, being 234 feet above the\r\nsea. The surface of the Volga, where it breaks through the high banks of\r\nSaratov, is only 36 feet above the ocean level; while the western shore,\r\nabove Saratov, is 562 feet in height. Farther down the river, Sarepta\r\nlies 30 feet below the sea level; and there is, therefore, between\r\nSaratov and Sarepta, a distance of about 180 miles, a fall of 66 feet.\r\nWest of the Volga, and following the river, is the continuation of the\r\nObstshei-Syrtis, ranging in elevation from 562 feet down to 168 feet.\r\nAt Sarepta, the low hills which thus far have skirted the Volga turn to\r\nthe southwest, to the Manitsh steppe, sinking to an elevation of but 75\r\nfeet, and extending as far as the Sea of Azof. At Sarepta, too, the Volga\r\nturns from its normal southerly course, and strikes southeasterly across\r\nthe Astracan steppe, entering the Caspian at the City of Astracan, 72\r\nfeet below the level of the sea. The level of the sea is 4 feet below the\r\nshore on which Astracan is built.\r\n\r\nThe old statements that the level of the Caspian is 300 feet below the\r\nocean, rested solely on conjectures made by the naturalist Pallas. The\r\ninfluence of this great depression on the warmer climate of that region,\r\nthe peculiar vegetation of the salt steppes, and the salt morasses which\r\nexist where the land is perfectly level, as well as the great beds of\r\noyster-shells and other crustaceous remains, led him to the hypothesis\r\nthat the whole neighboring district is the dry and deserted bed of a\r\nformer sea, now shrunk to the comparatively insignificant dimensions\r\nof the Caspian. The broken line of bold bluffs which bounds the\r\nObstshei-Syrtis on the south seemed to him to be the northern boundary of\r\nthis inland sea, into which the Volga entered below the pass of Kamyschin\r\nand Saratov. Parrot and Engelhardt supposed that their barometrical\r\nelevations in 1811 confirmed Pallas’ theory, that the Caspian lies 300\r\nfeet below the ocean. Many hypotheses were based upon their observations;\r\nbut the whole were at length brought into discredit by Humboldt, who\r\ndistrusted the accuracy of instruments made at that time. Nothing but a\r\ntrigonometrical survey from Taganrog to Astracan could give conclusive\r\nresults, and this was accomplished in 1837, under the auspices of the\r\nRussian government. The result proved that, so far from being 300 or 350\r\nfeet below the ocean, the Caspian is not 100 feet. Its depression, as\r\nalready stated, is about 76 feet.\r\n\r\nThe level of the Aral Sea, which is evidently closely linked to\r\nthe Caspian, has not yet been determined with absolute certainty.\r\nBarometrical observations were instituted for this end by the expedition\r\nunder General Berg, which explored that region in the winter of 1826,\r\nbut the cold was severe, and the results are questionable. The result of\r\ntheir investigations was, however, that the surface of the Aral lies 110\r\nfeet higher than that of the Caspian. This would make the Aral to be 34\r\nfeet above the sea level. More careful inquiries may, however, determine\r\nthe level of the two seas to be the same; but at present we have to be\r\ncontent with the results of the expedition referred to, and accept its\r\nelevation as 34 feet above the level of the ocean.\r\n\r\nWithout, however, going into details respecting the Aral, the region\r\naround the Caspian and directly connected with it, which is below the\r\nocean level, embraces an area of not less than 131,400 square miles. This\r\nsurvey extends from the Volga to the Ural River, thence to the Emba and\r\nthe northernmost point of the Sea of Aral, and thence to the salt lakes\r\nof Aksakal-Barbi, lying to the northeast of this sea. The tracing of\r\nthis line from the higher to the lower stages of depression gives clear\r\nindications, in the nature of the soil, of the existence of a great sea\r\nonce occupying that whole tract.\r\n\r\nThus much for the configuration of the Caspian lowland. If to these\r\n131,400 square miles be added the 153,000, or, according to Humboldt,\r\n164,000 square miles of the Caspian itself, the entire depression\r\nembraces almost 318,000 square miles, and is greater than France,\r\ngreater than Germany, and only to be compared with the whole Austrian\r\nempire! If to this great region be added the district around the Aral,\r\nwhich sea alone covers nearly 25,000 square miles, and then to this the\r\nyet unmeasured surface covered by seas yet to the eastward, the entire\r\nregion of depression is immensely increased. And then if to this be added\r\nthe great Siberian plain, whose level is not greatly above the sea, the\r\ncombined district would be at least once and a half as great as all\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Origin of the Ponto-Caspian Depression.\r\n\r\nThinking of the immense extent of this depressed region, whose entire\r\nsurface occupies no inconsiderable fraction of the interior of the Old\r\nWorld, and whose greatest depth at the bottom of the Caspian is from\r\n500 to 600 feet below the level of the ocean, and looking at it as a\r\nphenomenon wholly unique, the question arises: How would such a condition\r\nbe possible, contradicting, as it seems, all analogies? The answer, could\r\nwe reach it, would not fail to illustrate many recondite geological\r\nquestions, and to be full of instruction.\r\n\r\nYet the time has not come when a full answer can be given to this\r\ninquiry. We have not yet learned the elementary conditions of this\r\nremarkable fact; there are innumerable investigations yet to be made,\r\nbefore we can feel perfectly certain that its reason is understood.\r\nStill, there have been some preparatory inquiries entered upon, and some\r\npreliminary steps taken toward reaching a conclusion, or, at least,\r\ntoward assuming a reasonable hypothesis. We have already indicated our\r\nbelief that this depression is connected with a ring of plateaus which\r\nhave been upheaved around it, and which now inclose it and isolate it\r\nfrom the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe hollow has its greatest depth near the southern extremity of the\r\nCaspian, where it rises abruptly to the Persian plateau. There pass, in\r\nthe form of a half circle, the loftiest mountains and plateaus of central\r\nAsia. On the west side the Caucasus rises, with its giant peaks of\r\nKasbek and Elbrooz, 15,000 to 17,000 feet high, bearing all the marks of\r\nvolcanic origin,—avalanches of solidified lava on the sides, a lake lying\r\nin the abyss of an extinct crater, and the like.\r\n\r\nAt the southwest, the Armenian plateau follows the course of the Aras\r\nfrom its mouth back to the huge dome of Ararat, 14,656 feet high. The\r\nentire geological appearance of that region—the old lava streams, the\r\ntrachyte rocks—indicate with equal clearness, as in the Caucasus, the\r\nagency of volcanic forces in the upheaval of that district. Traces of\r\nthis great power are also seen in the caldron-shaped hollows, and in the\r\nnarrow and deep defiles, which are abundant in that region.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Caspian, which in its southern part reaches a depth ranging\r\nas low as 420, 480, and 600 feet, and, according to Hanway, even 2700\r\nfeet, rise sharply from the sea the Persian Coast Mountains. The plateau\r\nof Teheran, 3400 feet in elevation, is directly beyond, from which rise\r\nthe volcanic peaks of Demavend, 20,000 feet, and Euczan, 6600 feet high.\r\nThe Coast chain embraces the Elboorz Mountains, uniformly more than\r\n5000 feet high, but which, at Schemrum, northwest of Teheran, rise to\r\na height of 8560 feet; at Churchurah, southwest of Demavend, to 7650\r\nfeet; at Nevo, southeast of Demavend, to 8540 feet; at Nejoster, in the\r\nSeriakush, east of Demavend, to 7200 feet; and which, above Asterabad,\r\nrise in the Shahkush and the Sundukkush to a height of 7270 feet, and\r\nalmost everywhere display in their trachyte rocks the traces of ancient\r\nvolcanic activity. Still farther to the east, the chain which has girdled\r\nthe Caspian sinks from the lofty height of the Northern Taurus to 1872\r\nfeet; in Meshed, 2628 feet; in Herat, an average elevation of 3400 to\r\n4000 feet. But east of Herat it rises abruptly to the lofty plateaus of\r\nBamian and Cabool, 7000 and 8000 feet high, and in the peaks of Colubeba\r\n16,800 feet. The Hindoo Koosh, at Dsellalabad, rises to a height of\r\n18,984 feet; the table-lands of the Bolor, at the Issikul, are at an\r\nelevation of 14,664 feet; while the gigantic Pameer is not yet measured,\r\nthough its noted Pass is estimated at 18,000 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nAt this point we reach almost the 40th degree of N. lat., whence\r\nnorthward the mountain ranges gradually decline in height, after\r\nthrowing off eastward the great chain of Thian-Shan. From the sharp\r\nangle formed by the Hindoo Koosh and the Bolor, where the head-waters\r\nof the Gihon rise, that large but commercially unimportant river takes\r\nits way westward through the Bokharan table-land, falling so rapidly\r\nin its course to Bokhara that at the city its surface is but 1116 feet\r\nabove the sea, then striking northwesterly to the Aral and Caspian. The\r\ncourse of that stream indicates, therefore, the direction and degree of\r\nthe mountain slope toward the great depression east of the Caucasus and\r\nArmenia, north of the Persian highland, and west of the Hindoo Koosh and\r\nthe Bolor systems.\r\n\r\nThe lower course of the Gihon, from Bokhara downward, is through masses\r\nof mud, sand, and gravel, and can very easily be conceived to have\r\nchanged its course in the lapse of centuries, from the Caspian to the\r\nAral, as the course of the Sihon seems also to have changed. The great\r\nBokharan plain is covered in this part with a deposit of dried mud; it is\r\na steppe formed evidently from a now dry sea-basin, which, no less than\r\nthe northern shores of the Caspian and the Aral, displays the traces of\r\nthe oceanic character of entire regions.\r\n\r\nHalley, the astronomer, made an attempt to solve the mysterious origin of\r\nthis great sunken basin, and attributed it to the stroke of a first-class\r\ncomet! Arago, instead of calling into the scene meteorological forces\r\nlittle known, contented himself, in his theory of its origin, with the\r\nforces which we know are active even now on the earth, the plutonic\r\npowers which are only half confined by the surface of the globe. No\r\none, he says, will hesitate now to accept the upheaval theory, through\r\nwhich geology is able so clearly to indicate the forces and progress of\r\nstructure of the soil and rocks. The upheaval of great masses in one\r\nplace predisposes the depression of districts in their neighborhood, to\r\nmake good the true relation of highland to lowland. And in this case a\r\ncompensation may be found, according to Arago, for the great semicircle\r\nof mountains which passes around the southern margin of the Caspian\r\nbasin, in the depression caused by the natural falling in of the adjacent\r\nregion when the great mountains of western Asia were upheaved.\r\n\r\nIn longitudinal mountain chains the parallel ranges of valleys have\r\na similar origin; in volcanic chains, which have been thrown up in\r\na circular form, similar depressions have been found in the middle,\r\nalthough, it must be confessed, on a much smaller scale of dimensions\r\nthan in the Caspian hollow. The same feature is observable in the\r\nupheavals, by Von Buch, as observed in the Island of Palma, one of the\r\nCanaries, or in the Val di Bove, near Etna. Such depressions would at\r\nonce fill with water, if connected with the sea, as in the cup-shaped\r\nisland Santorini, or remain land-locked, if they occur in the interior,\r\nas in the case of Lake Laach, as the half-ring of mountains girding the\r\nlower portion of the Caspian seems to consist mainly of trachyte thrown\r\nup by volcanic agency: the analogy just drawn does not seem too remote.\r\nYet the process of structure must have had other concomitant conditions\r\nto account for the vast reach northward of the Caspian depression. It\r\nis clear that any such volcanic convulsion as would throw up those vast\r\nmountain ranges at the south, must have affected largely the geological\r\ncondition of all the adjacent region; the extent vertically of this\r\neffect would be best ascertained perhaps by deep boring. Unquestionably\r\nthere was many a revolution in the upper portions of the earth’s crust\r\nduring the formation of the great Caspian hollow, before it assumed its\r\npresent condition. From the agencies at work in connection with a great\r\ninternal ocean, the upper soil, as we have it to-day, was formed.\r\n\r\nThe Aral and the Caspian Seas remain as the lowest places of that great\r\ndepression, water being found in them, while elsewhere it has entirely\r\ndisappeared by evaporation: leaving us broad, low plains, instead of that\r\ngreat ocean which once extended from Persia over all Siberia, and west\r\nof the Caspian to the Sea of Azof. A more thorough account, geographical\r\nas well as geological, cannot be given till after much more extended\r\ninvestigations have been made into the physical characteristics of this\r\nregion than as yet have been prosecuted. It may be remarked here, that\r\nthe waters of the Aral and Caspian are bitter and salt, but not so much\r\nas those of the ocean; the bottom is covered with slime and sand. The\r\nAral has a depth ranging from 90 to 222 feet; the Caspian, beginning\r\nwith its extensive, shallows at the north, deepens toward the south,\r\ntill, reaching the lower third, its depth is over 600 feet; and thence\r\nsouthward it is no less deep, till it reaches the bold shore of Eusellis.\r\nFrom this lowest point the upheaval begins, which culminates in the great\r\nmountains on its southern border.\r\n\r\nAccording to Humboldt’s view, the great Caspian hollow embraces not only\r\nthe basin of the sea, but a vast dry plain, extending northward as far as\r\nSaratov and the Obstshei-Syrtis; even Uralsk lies lower than the level\r\nof the Black Sea. The same physical feature, though on a less extended\r\nscale than here, is found in Holland, China, Lower Egypt, and Palestine.\r\nSubsequently to the emergence of the continents, long before the filling\r\nin of huge fissures by mountain chains, and during the continuance of\r\nthose great convulsions which reach back into the remotest geological\r\nperiods, the surface of the continents must have been subjected to\r\nfrequent partial changes of level. The surface undulated probably in that\r\nsame wave movement which is now observable, though in much less degree,\r\nin those earthquakes and upheavals which the whole western part of South\r\nAmerica is experiencing even now.\r\n\r\nThe depressions which have assumed a permanent form since the convulsions\r\nwhich formed them, have gradually filled with deposited soil, and, were\r\nthe naturalist able to lay bare the primitive rock, he would discover\r\nthat it exists in the shape of great concavities, without a trace of\r\nthat evenness which now characterizes the surface. Eichwald has made\r\nit probable, by his personal observations, that the upheaval of Ararat\r\nand of the Armenian plateau on which this trachyte mountain rests, has\r\ndriven the Caspian Sea back east of the flat steppe of Karabagh and\r\nMogan, on the lower Aras, to the neighborhood of Bakoo. The water of\r\nthat sea formerly extended to the confluence of the Bargashad, (called\r\nalso Bergershat and Bergernet,) with the Aras, below Ireben. The traces\r\nof volcanic action there are decisively evident: the Caspian reached,\r\nbefore that action occurred, up what is now the valley of the Aras, as\r\nfar as Ararat; and in many places south of Erivan—at Saliyan, in Shirwan,\r\nand elsewhere—salt beds of the most crystalline quality, forming whole\r\nmountains and whole belts of salt lakes at the confluence of the Aras and\r\nthe Koor, demonstrate their formation in a former sea which once covered\r\nthat region. The very recent upheaval of the Ural chain cannot fail also\r\nto have had an influence in contracting the dimensions of the Caspian\r\nhollow.\r\n\r\nOnly two kindred depressions to this remain to be spoken of, which,\r\nthough of not so great superficial dimensions, are of yet greater\r\ndepth—the depression of the Jordan Valley and the bitter salt lakes on\r\nthe Isthmus of Suez. These we must consider before we pass from the\r\ncontrasts between highlands and lowlands to the transitions between them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Depression of the Jordan Valley and of the Dead Sea.\r\n\r\nThe nearest relationship to the Caspian hollow, displayed by any similar\r\nfeature, is found near the heart of the Old World, in the comparatively\r\ndiminutive and isolated valley of the Jordan, including the Dead Sea,\r\nwhose absolute depth below the level of the ocean has been determined\r\nonly within the most recent period. Many former travelers had noticed, in\r\nthe deep gulf which holds the Dead Sea, and especially at its north end,\r\nnear Jericho, a much greater degree of heat than elsewhere in Palestine,\r\nand the existence of many plants and fruits which they had met in the\r\nhotter climates of Arabia and India. The tree which yields the Mecca\r\nbalsam flourishes in the oasis of Jericho; the product of the balsam\r\nof Palestine supplied the pin-money of Cleopatra. A number of German\r\nand English observers endeavored to solve the question of the depth of\r\nthe Jordan basin—von Schubert, Russeger, von Wildenbruch, Moore, and\r\nBake, later Symonds, and Lynch; de Berton and Russeger made the first\r\nbarometrical observations at the Dead Sea, but they did not attempt\r\nto give more definite limits to their results than to assert that its\r\nsurface is somewhere between 500 and 1100 feet beneath the ocean level.\r\n\r\nVon Shubert’s barometer did not suffice to determine this point, but he\r\nascertained the surface of Lake Tiberias to be 535 feet below the surface\r\nof the Mediterranean. All barometrical measurements were unreliable at\r\nthat depth; yet it could not be denied that the depression could not be\r\nan insignificant one. A measurement with the level made by Symonds, an\r\nEnglishman, from Jaffa to the Dead Sea, in 1843, gave us our first sure\r\nresults. The surface of the lake lies 1231 feet beneath the level of the\r\nMediterranean at Jaffa. The subsequent expedition of the Americans—Lynch,\r\nDale, and Anderson, in 1848—has given the following additional results:—\r\n\r\n    The surface of Lake Tiberias lies beneath the ocean level, 612 ft.\r\n     ”         ”   the Dead Sea    ”         ”        ”       1235  ”\r\n\r\nSoundings of the Dead Sea, made with the greatest care, determined the\r\ndepth to be, according to Lynch, 1227 feet; according to Symonds, 1970\r\nfeet. The entire depression below the ocean level would be, then, by\r\nLynch’s measurement, 1235 + 1227 = 2462 feet; according to Symonds’, 1235\r\n+ 1970 = 3205 feet. This is the greatest known depression on the globe.\r\nJerusalem lies 2449 feet above the ocean level. From the roofs of the\r\ncity to the surface of the Dead Sea is, therefore, 2449 + 1235 = 3684\r\nfeet; and the entire descent from the capital to the bottom of the Dead\r\nSea is 4911 feet, if we adopt Lynch’s measurement, and 5654, if we follow\r\nSymonds’.\r\n\r\nThe basin of the Dead Sea consists of two very different parts—the larger\r\nand deeper northern one, the smaller and shallow southern one; the two\r\nbeing separated by a sandy peninsula—el Mesraa—and connected by a narrow\r\nchannel of insignificant depth. The northern basin seems to owe its\r\npresent form to the unchanged primitive depression; the southern one\r\nto a partial upheaval at some later epoch. But in breadth they do not\r\nvary much one from the other; both have their larger axis coincident\r\nwith the Jordan valley, which here widens a little, but which is still\r\nhemmed in here, as farther north, by the parallel ranges of mountains.\r\nThe chain east of the sea appears to rise a thousand feet higher than\r\nthe one west of it. The depths of the two basins are entirely unlike.\r\nThe southern is nowhere more than 12 feet deep, and diminishes to 5 feet\r\nand less than this near the shores, so that the southern half of it is\r\nentirely unnavigable by craft of any size; and those who wish to land\r\nhave to wade for a long distance through mud as deep as their ankles.\r\nThe northern part, on the contrary, attains a uniform depth of more than\r\n1000 feet, from the north to the south; in the northern third it is even\r\n1227 feet; toward the west coast it shoals to between 600 and 800 feet,\r\nbut is 500 feet deep hard-by the coast. There is but a very narrow rim\r\nof shallow water on the western side, and the navigation is, therefore,\r\ntolerably safe. On the eastern shore the coast is even bolder, and the\r\ndescent to deep water immediate. Close by the romantic mouth of the\r\nArnon, embouching through rocks, the depth of the sea is about 1052 feet.\r\nSo great a difference in the depth of the two basins seems to indicate a\r\nconsiderable diversity in the manner of their formation.\r\n\r\nVolcanic activities have been felt in the Jordan valley up to the present\r\ntime. They manifest themselves in various forms—deposits of salt, hot\r\nsprings and naphtha springs, asphaltum beds, sulphur fumes, currents\r\nof heated air, clouds of smoke, and rumblings beneath the surface.\r\nThe Jordan valley remained, from Lake Tiberias down, unfilled, as we\r\nshould infer from analogy that it would be by the upheaval of a chain\r\nof volcanic mountains; or by the expansion of an internal lake or sea,\r\nthe waters accumulating till at last they should acquire such volume as\r\nto break away and form new channels. In case the obstructions were too\r\ngreat, they would remain inland lakes. And such is the Dead Sea, its\r\nsouthern border being too high to allow it a free exit into the Red Sea.\r\n\r\nMany other fissures or hollows on the surface of the continents would\r\nbe regarded as lowlands, were they not filled with water. The bottoms\r\nof such lakes often sink suddenly to a great depth, while others are\r\nlagoon-like, or shallow seas of an entirely different hydrographical\r\ncharacter. Internal lakes, regarded as isolated lowlands, merely filled\r\nwith water, are an especially interesting theme of study; yet much\r\nremains to be investigated regarding their structure and historical\r\nformation. The Dead Sea has been regarded, up to this time, as the\r\ndeepest of all such lakes. The greatest depth of the Caspian has not yet\r\nbeen fully ascertained; but if Hanway’s soundings, 2700 feet, are to be\r\nrelied on, it is very great. Lake Baikal, in its deepest part, between\r\nthe two steep walls of rock which rise high above the surface, has not\r\nyet been carefully sounded; but as its surface is 1500 feet above the\r\nsea, its bottom does not probably fall below the ocean level. The great\r\nchain of North American lakes, whose area embraces about 109,500 square\r\nmiles, are surrounded by level country from 500 to 600 feet above the\r\nsea—a region which, in part, falls under the designation of plateaus of\r\nthe lowest class, and which, in part, comes under the name of lowland;\r\nthe surface of Lake Superior being 627 feet above the sea, Lakes Michigan\r\nand Huron 578 feet each, Lake Erie 565 feet, and Lake Ontario 232 feet.\r\nThe three first named, having a depth of about 900 feet, have their beds\r\nabout 300 feet below the surface of the ocean; Lake Ontario, with a depth\r\nof 500 feet, reaches a point 268 feet below the sea level. The depth of\r\nthe St. Lawrence river bed, as related to the sea, is not ascertained.\r\nThe most of the Swiss lakes, too, having a depth often of more than 1000\r\nfeet, come under the same category with the lakes under consideration\r\nabove, waters from the mountains having gradually filled up chasms made\r\nat the time of the upheaval of the adjacent region. Some of these lake\r\nbasins may be deep enough to lie below the level of the ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bitter Lakes of the Suez Isthmus.\r\n\r\nSome bitter salt lakes on the Isthmus of Suez, forming a chain from\r\nthe Red Sea to the southeast corner of the Mediterranean, long claimed\r\nattention from their supposed singularity. During the occupation of\r\nEgypt by the French in 1799, a survey of the district was made with the\r\nlevel, in view of a prospective canal across the isthmus, connecting\r\nthe Nile with the Red Sea. An account of that survey was published\r\nby Le Père, in his great Description de l’Egypte. The result of the\r\nsurvey was very surprising; it assigned to the Gulf of Suez a height of\r\n25 feet at ebb tide and 30½ feet at flood tide, above the level of the\r\nMediterranean, a result which seemed to agree with Pliny’s account (vi.\r\n23) of the elevation of the Red Sea above the level of lower Egypt. The\r\nsalt swamps lying between the two seas, and known even to the ancients,\r\nlie, according to the same authority, 20 feet below the surface of the\r\nMediterranean, and 50 feet below that of the Red Sea. These singular\r\nstatements were not received without considerable doubt as to their\r\ncorrectness; but during the military disturbances in that region, no\r\nrevision of the investigations could be made. Certain circumstances\r\nconnected with an unusual inundation of the Nile in 1800, when its waters\r\nflowed as far as the transverse valley called the Wady Tumilet, in which\r\nthe salt lakes lie, and where traces of the ancient canal, built by the\r\nEgyptians between the seas, could be seen, seemed to confirm the result\r\nof the survey of 1799. The inference was a natural one—that the sandy\r\nIsthmus of Suez was an accumulation of dunes, and of the deposits of\r\ninundations of both the Mediterranean and Red Seas, and that the salt\r\nmorasses in the middle are but a trace of the primitive bottom. There\r\nwere not wanting defenders of the old measurement, Favier being the most\r\nprominent. Since 1845 five surveys have been made, in reference to the\r\nprojected canal. These all contradict the results of 1799, and show that\r\nthere is but the difference of four-sevenths of a foot between the level\r\nof the two seas, and that there is the same agreement there as in all\r\nother parts of the earth. Many hypotheses, built on the old measurement,\r\nhave accordingly fallen to the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Regions of Transition between Highlands and Lowlands; the River\r\nSystems of the Globe.\r\n\r\nBetween the two great and most sharply-marked physical features—the high\r\nplateaus and mountains and the lands of very little elevation—there are\r\nregions of transition very numerous and exceedingly varied.\r\n\r\nThe conception of highlands and of lowlands having a certain, constant,\r\nand absolute value, and it being immaterial whether the elevation\r\nbe specially marked or not, provided it be uniform, the regions of\r\ntransition find their most marked characteristics in their want of\r\nconstancy, in their very change, and the rate at which the grade ascends\r\nfrom a low to a high elevation, or falls from a high to a low one. Their\r\nreal value lies in the mutual compensation of highlands and lowlands,\r\nwhich is effected through the mediation of a third physical feature or\r\nsystem, which has received the name Lands of Gradation, or Terrace Lands,\r\nand which, by their gradual rise from the sea level, serve as the means\r\nof transition from the lowest lowlands to the loftiest plateaus and\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nTerrace Lands and Rivers in their General Character.\r\n\r\nDistricts sloping to the sea, or lands of gradation, as we have called\r\nthem, varying as they do in elevation and in relative situation to\r\neach other, are the true mediators between the districts but little\r\nabove the level of the sea and others much more lofty. At the sources\r\nand the mouths of rivers they partake, more or less fully, in the\r\ncharacteristics of both highland and lowland. The manner of their\r\nmediation, as determined by the rate of the fall of water and by their\r\ndirection, gives to every one of these regions of transition its\r\npeculiar character, determines its conformation and its relation to\r\nthe globe. And yet, no more than in lowlands and highlands, can we rid\r\nourselves of some arbitrary data relating to the size of rivers, when\r\nwe discriminate between those which we call large and those which we\r\ncall small. As in all other geographical distinctions, we must here\r\nbe content with arbitrary approximation, and with the ordinary usages\r\nof speech. The comparison of streams, in regard to their breadth and\r\nfullness, determines their volume; the comparison, in respect of length\r\nand tributary waters, determines the compass of the river system. The\r\nentire characteristics, breadth, depth of channel, length and extent\r\nof drainage, determine the status of the river, whether first, second,\r\nor third class, in relation first to those of the same continent, and\r\nthen to those of the world. The Volga, for instance, is, in relation\r\nto Europe, a first-class river, but, like the Danube, in relation to\r\nthe entire globe, is merely in the second or third rank. Not the length\r\nalone determines the importance of rivers. The Thames, one of the\r\nsmallest streams in Europe, is one of the most important. And aside from\r\ncommercial considerations, a river of insignificant size can have great\r\ninfluence in consequence of its relation to the entire adjacent region.\r\nThe little Bavarian Isar, a river which, so far as the great world is\r\nconcerned, seems to have no importance, receives on the left side the\r\nwater of 860 tributary brooks, among which are 44 rivulets; on the right\r\nbank the water of 433: these 1293 brooks and rivulets pour themselves\r\ninto the Isar through 103 direct tributaries, and not these alone, but\r\nthe waters of 136 lakes are embraced within the Isar system! Yet the Isar\r\nis only one of 34 branches of the Danube, and of the fourth rank even\r\namong them, and the Danube is by no means one of the great rivers of\r\nthe globe. A short but navigable stream can have great influence over\r\na territory limited in extent, and may make a long but shallow stream\r\nsink into insignificance in respect of comparative importance to the\r\nworld. There are some great streams which are of first magnitude in all\r\ntheir characteristics—rivers which drain millions of square miles in\r\ntheir course to the sea. The number of such is small, however; there are\r\nscarcely fifty on the whole globe. Besides these, there is a large number\r\nof rivers much shorter, and of much less volume, but not deficient in the\r\nattributes which give a stream value to man, and which serve to mediate\r\nbetween highlands and lowlands, to fulfill the needs of navigation and\r\nto drain regions of more or less magnitude. These can be classed in four\r\nranks: in the first place absolutely, and in the second place in relation\r\nto each continent. Yet, in classing them, it is necessary always to keep\r\nin mind that it is not size alone which gives a river its value, but a\r\ncombination of all its characteristics, and its relative influence on the\r\ncountry through which it runs.\r\n\r\nLooking at the direction of streams, we observe that there are some which\r\nflow northerly, as for instance those of Siberia, the Nile, the Rhine,\r\nthe Elbe, and the Weser; there are those which flow southward—the Indus,\r\nGanges, Euphrates, La Plata, Mississippi, and Volga, for example; there\r\nare those flowing eastward—Hoang-ho and Yang-tse-Kiang, the Amazon, the\r\nOrinoco, and the Danube, for instance; and some westward, instances of\r\nwhich may be found in the Gihon and Sihon, the Senegal, Gambia, Niger,\r\nthe Colorado, the Seine, Loire, Garonne, and the Spanish rivers which\r\nenter the sea in Portugal.\r\n\r\nAnd this characteristic, trite and unmeaning as it may at first seem,\r\nestablishes, for the area which these rivers water, very diverse\r\nconditions. In like manner, too, their position, in relation to the\r\noceans into which they flow, is very influential, in consequence of\r\nthe action of the tide upon the lower course. The emergence of their\r\nhead-waters at various altitudes, whether on plateaus of the first or\r\nsecond class, or on mountain tops covered with perpetual snow, gives rise\r\nto a great diversity of relations, that makes no one stream on the earth\r\ntwin brother to any other. Rivers have an individuality which claims\r\nrecognition, although they are usually summed up in one category.\r\n\r\nThis diversity in rivers becomes more apparent from a study of the\r\ndiversified form of the terraces, or grades of transition, through which\r\nthey pass on their way to the sea.\r\n\r\nThe great basin of the Nile is divided into three distinct parts or\r\ngrades—Abyssinia, Nubia, and Egypt; and each of them has long been\r\nstudied historically and physically. The great basin of the Rhine is\r\nalso naturally divided into three grades—the Swiss highlands, the German\r\nmoderate plateau, and the lowlands of Holland. In a similar manner there\r\nmay almost always be traced in rivers three natural grades, and where\r\nthey do not have, as in the cases just cited they do have, a historical\r\nsignificance, their physical influence is not hard to trace and to follow\r\ninto all its analogies.\r\n\r\nThe word water-shed, now a familiar one, is applied to that point\r\nof division where contiguous springs pour their water in different\r\ndirections. It is not even in a mountainous country necessarily\r\ncoincident with the highest points of the chain, though it may be; the\r\nvalleys may slope in such a way as to have more influence in determining\r\nthe direction of running water than the mountains hard by. Every stream\r\nhas its own water-shed system, and this system is the real boundary of\r\nits basin. If we trace this basin to its very limits on the highlands,\r\nwe may find, not a mile away, the beginnings of another river, which\r\nshall flow in just the contrary direction, as for example in the case of\r\nthe Rhine and Rhone, the Volga and the Dwina. The sources of the Missouri\r\nand of the Columbia lie close together, not a quarter of an hour’s walk\r\napart; yet the waters of one flow into the Atlantic, of the other into\r\nthe Pacific, and their mouths are almost 2500 miles apart. The Mongolians\r\nhold the water-shed in such estimation that they throw up a heap of\r\nstones wherever one occurs, establish it a shrine for prayer; and the\r\nToongooses of Siberia never pass by one without casting a cedar branch\r\nupon the stone heap, that, to use their expression, “the holy mountain\r\nthat parts the waters may not lessen, but increase.”\r\n\r\nThe main channel is the stream proper; the others are tributaries. The\r\nlongest tributaries coming in from the region where the river proper\r\nrises, can be grouped intimately with the source of the main current,\r\nhardly distinguished from it in relative importance—the two, for\r\ninstance, in the Nile, the five in the Indus, two in the Ganges, three\r\nin the Amazon, etc. All form in their confluence the real channel of the\r\nriver. And the entire body of tributaries, taken in conjunction with\r\nthe river proper, forms the river system, and the district which they\r\nall drain is their true reciprocal. The two, in their mutual action and\r\nreaction, form a whole, and are always thought of together. The source\r\nand the mouth are the beginning and the end of the whole system; the main\r\nchannel and the circuit of water-shed, the center and the circumference\r\nof it. All the tributaries in their union constitute what may be called\r\nthe arterial system of the river basin; the form of each and the\r\ncharacteristics of each are analogous to those of the whole, only in\r\nreduced pattern. The network which all the tributaries make is often\r\nsurprisingly intricate. The symmetry with which the main characteristics\r\nof a river system are carried into the details, even of its smallest\r\naccessories, can only be compared to that observable in the architectural\r\nregularity of a tree, as it expands from the main trunk into the\r\ncountless symmetrical branches.\r\n\r\nThere are some rivers which are entirely independent of tributaries—which\r\npursue their way to the sea entirely alone. Such rivers, however, never\r\nbelong to the first class; they are always of subordinate magnitude,\r\nand the humblest of them are mere coast torrents, like those west of\r\nthe Andes. Others find their way to no ocean, but lose themselves in an\r\ninland sea or lake, as the Volga does in the Caspian; as the Gihon and\r\nthe Sihon do in the Aral; as the Jordan does in the Dead Sea. Others\r\ndisappear in sand wastes or in morasses; such are the rivers of the\r\nAfrican steppes. Others are blocked up, as it were, by the tidal wave of\r\nthe ocean, and are thus converted into estuary lakes.\r\n\r\nThere are some rivers, also, which remain equally or nearly equally full\r\nthe whole year through; there are others which have their seasons of\r\noverflow: the Nile, for instance, and many rivers whose basin lies within\r\nthe region of tropical rains; there are temporary rivers, now full,\r\nnow empty, which, if they do not leave, like the torrents of Arabia, a\r\nperfectly dry bed, are traced in the dry season by a row of stagnant\r\nlakes, such, for example, as are found in the swampy lands of Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\nRivers more closely considered.\r\n\r\nWhat is peculiar to every river is determined by the abundance of its\r\nsources, the forking of its tributaries, the rate of its descent, the\r\ndistance from its most remote springs to its mouth, the main direction\r\nof its course, and the greater or less sinuosities of its channel, as\r\noccasioned by the structure of the country which it traverses.\r\n\r\nThe abundance of its waters is conditioned by the greater or less amount\r\nof snow which finds the highest springs, the heavy rains which it\r\nreceives in tropical countries, and the exceedingly varied influences\r\nwhich temperate climates may exert upon it. The fall softens from the\r\nrush and plunge of the mountain district, first to an arrowy swiftness,\r\nthen to a moderate course, then to a beautiful gliding motion, to end\r\nwith an almost imperceptible flow just before entering the sea.\r\n\r\nThe direction of rivers is determined:—\r\n\r\n1. By the structure of the region which they traverse, the layers being\r\nin some places horizontal, and in others tilted to a vertical position;\r\nhere grouped, as in the granite Carpathian chain, in such a way that the\r\nriver courses which begin there run in parallel lines, radiating like\r\nthe rays of a star from a central point; then grouped in such a manner\r\nthat a stream may receive tributaries from two nearly contiguous ranges,\r\nas among the spurs of the Ural Mountains, the Rhone in Valais, receiving\r\nwaters from the Bernese Alps at the north, and Pennine Alps at the south;\r\nthe Isère, in like manner, the Upper Rhine in Grisons, the whole Upper\r\nInn in Tyrol.\r\n\r\n2. The direction is also determined by the mutual action of tributaries\r\nand the main stream at the point of confluence. Very often the union of\r\ntwo powerful currents gives rise to a third direction, according to the\r\nlaw known as the parallelogram of the forces. This generally occurs when\r\nno obstacle stands in the way of their taking a normal course, and is\r\nexemplified in the cases of the Kama and Volga, the Theiss and Danube,\r\nthe Rhine and Main, the Saone and Rhone. Where an obstacle stands in the\r\nway, their abnormal direction is manifested in the abrupt bendings of the\r\nriver bed. An instance is found in the bending of the Rhone northward\r\nas it emerges from Valais. Its lower course, from Lake Geneva to Lyons,\r\nbetrays the same angularities, resulting from the obstacles which it\r\nmeets and cannot remove. The Rhine, breaking through the Jura at Basel,\r\nis another instance; the Rhine, between Bingen and Caub, and the Dal-Elf,\r\nin Sweden, also exemplify the same.\r\n\r\nIn case that rivers meet in their course large masses of stratified\r\nrocks, they force their way through them in a zigzag direction, making\r\nsharp angles always, and not unfrequently right angles, even. Instances\r\nof this are found in the Rhine, between Mayence and Coblentz, and in the\r\nMoselle, between Treves and Coblentz. When the river passes beyond these\r\nrocky barriers, and meets with obstructions of a more movable character,\r\nit crowds them more gently and gracefully aside, and leaves a path more\r\nsinuous and wave-like; and yet more gentle are its curves, as it opens a\r\nway through the plains where nothing obstructs its course. The last is\r\nstrikingly exemplified in the rivers of eastern Europe, especially in all\r\nthose of middle and southern Russia. The practised eye can determine the\r\nstructure of the soil with considerable certainty, by merely tracing the\r\ncourse of rivers when represented on a faithful map. For, unless there\r\nbe other reasons to prevent, rivers always force their way where there\r\nis the least resistance to overcome. In stratified rocks, where the tilt\r\nis so great as to make the strata vertical, the river beds usually run\r\nparallel with the lines of stratification. Instances are found among\r\nthe Alpine rocks, in Valais along the Rhone, in Tyrol along the Inn and\r\nAdige, in Grisons, and among the Jura along the Rhine. Where the lines of\r\nstratification are horizontal, rivers usually take their course through\r\nthe most marked ravines and fissures.\r\n\r\nIn most mountains, however, the lines of stratification are neither\r\nvertical nor horizontal, but intermediate between them, more or less\r\nsloping, as in most marked ranges of central Germany, for example. In\r\nsuch cases, the process of excavating river beds has been determined by\r\nvarious circumstances and conditions, and the direction of their channels\r\ndoes not alone depend upon the extent and tilt of the strata, but also on\r\nother forces which have exercised a favoring or a retarding influence on\r\ntheir direct course. The stratification has its influence, indeed, but it\r\nis general rather than specific. Still, it is very largely felt when it\r\nhappens to coincide in its main lines with the direction of the mountain\r\nrange, but is comparatively insignificant when it does not. We have\r\ninstances in the Alps where the axis of stratification coincides with\r\nthat of the main chain, from south-southwest to north-northeast; in the\r\nJura, from southwest to northeast; and in the Scandinavian range, from\r\nsouth to north.\r\n\r\nThe different geological formations found in mountain districts have\r\na very important influence in determining the direction of rivers.\r\nMountains do not generally consist of rocks of one kind of structure,\r\nbut of several. What stratification is to mountains whose geological\r\nformation is the same throughout, the superposition of different kinds\r\nof rocks is to those of composite materials. The layers may be divided\r\ninto superior, inferior, and adjacent. These usually vary in respect to\r\nage, and may be traced in a regular geological seniority, as for example\r\nsandstone, gypsum, limestone, gray-wacke, and granite. These formations\r\nare either closely contiguous, or are separated merely by valleys, as\r\nfor instance in the Carpathian chain, where the central granite knot is\r\nseparated by valley plains from the more southern limestone chain; an\r\nexample of contiguity is found on the west spur of the same Carpathian\r\nrange. Wherever mountain systems of varied geological structure approach\r\neach other very closely, rivers seldom break their way through either\r\none, but find their way along the roots of the mountains, till at last\r\nthey come to a less confined place. Such river courses are often very\r\nlarge and deep; for the mountain streams which meet and are hemmed in\r\nby the narrow pass between the two contiguous ranges sweep all loose\r\nobstructions before them, and not only leave their path clear, but\r\ncontinually deepen it. We find this in the Ural, the Isère, the Rhone,\r\nAar, Inn, in all the long and winding Alpine valleys, and in the Ebro,\r\nfed by the parallel ridges of the Pyrenees. The circle of rivers which\r\ngirds the central Carpathian knot is an illustration of what was said\r\na moment since. The Poprad, Dunayic, Arva, and Waag are found where\r\nthe true Carpathian chain, which is granitic, is closely contiguous to\r\nsubordinate ranges of limestone and gray-wacke. In any accurate map,\r\nthe long, winding course between these two chains may be easily traced.\r\nLooking at the point where the Hartz Mountains and the Thuringian ridge\r\ntouch at their roots, the groups are seen to be insulated, as it were,\r\nby the rivers which gird their bases. In the great streams of southern\r\nand southwestern Asia, too, the line of the water-courses can be traced\r\nalong the narrow valleys which separate main from subordinate mountain\r\nchains; the Terek, Kooban, Koor, Aras, Euphrates, Tigris, Indus, Ganges,\r\nand probably the Chinese rivers, are all examples of this.\r\n\r\nSome streams seem to be entirely independent of all these laws in forming\r\ntheir channels, and to have their direction assigned to them by the\r\nfreaks of nature, such, for instance, as fissures in mountain chains and\r\nclefts, which remain to indicate ancient convulsions.\r\n\r\nThe entire course of a river is divided into three distinct and\r\nsubordinate courses—the upper, middle, and lower. To these and their\r\nrespective tributaries correspond the three grades of transition found\r\non the banks, and which have already been alluded to. Not only the total\r\namount of fall in the river bed, but also the angle of inclination,\r\nand the whole complex of phenomena in the basin, are reciprocal to\r\nthe threefold character of transition in almost every hydrographical\r\nsystem in the world. Still, the variety of relations which arise from\r\nthe combination of different elements is so variable, that an almost\r\ninfinite diversity arises in the characteristics of rivers, and these\r\ncharacteristics always vary, too, according as found in the upper,\r\nmiddle, or lower course.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpper Course of Rivers.\r\n\r\nThis begins at the ridge of the water-shed, and extends to the limits\r\nwhere the river emerges from the most rocky highlands. It depends for\r\nits existence upon the greater fall in the river bed there than lower\r\ndown. At the upper course, therefore, rivers which may flow in exactly\r\nopposite directions are brought into direct neighborhood. The farther\r\nthey advance from the water-shed the more they recede from each other.\r\nIn the High Forest south of the Carpathian chain, and in the Bory Morass\r\nnorth of it, the waters which flow into the Baltic and into the Black\r\nSeas spring from the ground side by side. The name given to the districts\r\nwhere the head-waters of large and navigable rivers part is usually the\r\nFrench word portages, the English word transports being little used in\r\nthat connection, although all, the German Trageplatze and the Russian\r\nWolok, involve the idea of _carrying_, of porterage, from the head-waters\r\nof one stream to those of another. The lowest parts of a water-shed, the\r\npasses of a high mountain range, for example, the intermediate vales of\r\nlower ones, and the most elevated plains in flat districts, are the most\r\nsuitable for the purpose of canal building, to serve as a connecting link\r\nbetween the sources of divergent streams; as, for instance, the canal\r\nwhich is proposed to connect the Baltic and the Black Seas by uniting\r\nthe Vistula and Danube, the tributaries, the Poprad, Hernad, and Theiss\r\nbeing the channel of communication up to the mountains where a canal\r\nis to pass over the water-shed formed by the valleys of the Carpathian\r\nchain. Such a communication is the most available which can be made\r\nbetween the opposite sides of a mountain range. The practicability of\r\nconstructing such canals depends very largely upon the degree of fall in\r\nthe upper course of the connected rivers, as determined by the slope of\r\nthe bed toward the horizon. The grade of most mountains’ sides, which\r\nstand back to back, is unlike on the two sides: steep on the one, slight\r\non the other. Upon this depends the greater or less wildness of the\r\nstreams flowing through their upper course. In the Ural chain the slope\r\nis steep on the eastern side, gradual on the western; in the Caucasus,\r\nsteep on the north, gradual on the south; in the Carpathian and the\r\nAlps, just the reverse—steep on the south, gradual on the north. The rate\r\nof fall varies; but, in general, it lies between an angle of 2° and an\r\nangle of 6°, taking the entire upper course into account. On the very\r\nsteep north side of the Pyrenees, the fall is between 3° and 4°; on the\r\nsouth side of the Alps, from the summits of Mont Rosa and Mont Blanc to\r\nthe plains of Piedmont, it is 3¾°. It is far less in more unimportant\r\nranges. And this angle, it should be remarked, is an average; it is the\r\nresultant of a great number of special, short slopes, which vary from the\r\nperpendicularity of an occasional waterfall to the equally occasional\r\ntranquillity of a meadow-like flow. The incidental slopes are, of course,\r\nmuch greater than the average of all. A grade of 15° is very steep; it\r\nis the maximum that can be ascended by a beast of burden. A grade of\r\n8° is the maximum for wheeled vehicles; all roads must be less sloping\r\nthan this. To accomplish the ascent of 35°, a man on foot must have some\r\nassistance. A grade of 44° in the high peaks of Mexico and Peru, Humboldt\r\nfound inaccessible; only where the growth of trees and shrubs gave him an\r\nopportunity of planting his feet, could he climb where it was a little\r\nsteeper than 44°. The Carpathians and the Pyrenees, on account of their\r\nsteepness and their scanty verdure, are very difficult to ascend. The\r\nAlps are much more easily climbed than the mountains just mentioned, in\r\nconsequence of their abundant growth of turf and undergrowth. The richest\r\nAlpine meadows of Switzerland have an inclination not exceeding 20°; at a\r\ngreater slope the vegetation becomes more sparse. The grade on which it\r\nis possible for earth to cling, Lehman fixes at 45°, and considers that\r\nthe normal slope, because at a greater angle, rain glances or ricochets.\r\nBut Lehman is not right in assigning this as the normal slope possible\r\nfor earth to cling and vegetation to grow, for on the Alps soil adheres\r\nand plants get a footing at a much steeper angle than 45°; in fact, the\r\nmodifications in the appearance of the Alps, by the growth of trees\r\nclinging to steeper slopes than this, are very marked. From the highest\r\npossible grade where vegetation can get a footing, we advance to the\r\nsheer perpendicular.\r\n\r\nThe upper course of rivers is characterized rather by plunges than by\r\nequable flowing, and determines its way by a series of leaps through\r\nzigzag cuts and various ravines. It traverses bowl-shaped hollows and\r\nnarrow defiles, and makes its way even through mountain lakes, depositing\r\nin them its residuum of sand and gravel which it has caught up and swept\r\nalong. In its wild plunges it draws into its body considerable air, which\r\nappears as bubbles, and makes it a white mass of foam. By-and-by it\r\nreaches more level ground, becomes clear as crystal, and assumes a rich\r\nemerald green, or a deep blue. It is unnavigable, wild, romantic, and is\r\nalways found in mountain districts.\r\n\r\nThe brawling brooks of Salzburg, of the Pyrenees, and of Sweden and\r\nNorway, all partake of this character. Those of the Pyrenees have a fall\r\nof an inch in every foot, and in some places cataracts of two or three\r\nfeet. The same is observable in the Alps, where the continual stir of the\r\nwater mixes in air enough to turn all into a mass of silvery-white foam.\r\nThe Carpathian waters are the same before they reach the high plateaus\r\nlying at their feet. The Alpine lakes, too, which lie within the upper\r\ncourse of the rivers which feed them, have a considerable fall; Lago\r\nMaggiore, for instance, has a descent of 52 feet between Magadino and\r\nArona.\r\n\r\nIn all the most marked mountain systems of Europe, the upper course of\r\nthe rivers is especially prominent. Northern Europe is characterized by\r\nthe fact that its streams have, throughout the most of their length, the\r\npeculiarities of the upper course—whether observed in northern Russia, in\r\nall Sweden, Norway, and Scotland.\r\n\r\nWith the exit of the river from the mountain district, all these\r\nrelations are changed, and a new character begins.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Middle Course.\r\n\r\nFar more moderate is the descent after the river emerges from the\r\nmountain region, or where it has never experienced the wild turbulence of\r\nthe upper course, as is the case in most of the rivers of eastern Europe.\r\nIn the middle course the angle of inclination is much modified. The upper\r\nMain has a fall of 342 feet within three miles after leaving Fichtel\r\nMountains. The descent of most of the rivers of central Germany is much\r\nless than this. The Neckar, whose sources lie 2084 feet above the sea, in\r\npassing to Heilbronn, which is 450 feet above the sea, falls at the rate\r\nof about an inch to every 32 feet. The fall of the Saale, after leaving\r\nthe Fichtel range, is about 20 feet to the mile; that of Naab, about 14;\r\nthat of the Eger, less; and that of the upper Oder, in Silesia, still\r\nless. More gradual yet is the slope of the Volga bed, which falls but\r\n1400 in about 2050 miles, considerably less than a foot to a mile; and in\r\nits lower course its inclination must be still less.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the current must necessarily be very different from those\r\nobservable under the influence of the dashing and wayward upper course.\r\n\r\nThe name River Bed is given to the entire breadth of the hollow which\r\nholds the river, and which varies in width according to the stage of the\r\nwater, especially in large streams like the great rivers of America. The\r\nMississippi is a mile wide at Natchez at low water, at high water almost\r\nthirty. The Orinoco, at St. Thomas, is three miles wide at low water, at\r\nhigh water it is over seventy. In the Volga and the Danube the stage of\r\nwater makes great differences in the width of the river bed. In summer\r\nthe depth and breadth are, as a rule, less than in winter.\r\n\r\nThe Channel differs from the river bed; it is the part of the river bed\r\nwhich gives life and motion to the whole current. In the upper course the\r\nchannel and the river bed generally coincide; in the middle and lower\r\ncourses, on the contrary, the channel occupies but a very small share\r\nof the whole bed, but yet it determines the direction, amount of fall,\r\nand the rapidity of the stream. It lies usually not in the middle of the\r\nriver bed, but on one side; it passes, however, from bank to bank; it\r\nis indicated by the movement of ships, which always follow it, and it\r\nlies uniformly adjacent to the boldest shore. It widens the whole river\r\nbed toward one side, and not toward both; and so streams which traverse\r\ngreat plains, like the great Hungarian one, for instance, do not now run\r\nthrough the middle, but course along at the base of the marginal bluffs.\r\nIn all such cases, it will be found that the channel hugs the boldest\r\nside of the bed. All the four Carpathian rivers, as they wind out between\r\nthe main range and the subordinate ranges, have their steepest shore, not\r\non the side of the loftiest, but on the side of the boldest mountains,\r\nand these are the ones of the subordinate range. So, in the plains which\r\nlie between the Swiss Alps and the Jura, the bold sides of the river bed\r\nlie on the side of the bolder though less important chain, and not on the\r\nside of the Alpine meadows. The bold banks of the Ebro are not on the\r\nside of the Pyrenees and their plains, but on the south side. All the\r\nstreams of South and Middle Russia have, therefore, on the east side,\r\ntheir low banks, on the west the bold ones; and this, because the most\r\nextensive plains lie on the eastern side.\r\n\r\nIn the more level tracts the windings of rivers are very much increased\r\nin magnitude. These windings check the current. The serpentine course\r\nis characteristic of rivers in their middle course, and it is repeated,\r\nthough on a small scale, in every meadow brook. The serpentine course of\r\nrivers gives rise to countless islands and intervals: as, for example,\r\nbetween Bâle and the Rhinegau, but, with very few exceptions, no lakes,\r\nthe characteristic feature of the upper course of rivers. But the broad\r\nmeadow lands of the middle course very often indicate in the clearest\r\nmanner that they were once lakes of considerable magnitude, which have\r\nsubsided and left their basin a dry plain. An example may be found in the\r\nmeadow land of the Rhine, from Bâle to Bastberg, below Strasbourg, and\r\nagain from Ladenburg, in the Palatinate, to Bingen. So on the Danube,\r\nfrom Ulm to Passau, Lintz, and Kloster Newburg, and again from Pesth\r\nto Beloro Semlin, as far, in fact, as the narrows at Orsova. The same\r\nfeature is met in the middle course of the Volga, from Tver eastward to\r\nthe west Ural, and southward to Saratov and Kamishin, where it breaks\r\nthrough the Obstshei-Syrtis, which was, doubtless, once the barrier of\r\na great inland lake. In these basins, now dry, there is a surprising\r\nuniformity of characteristics wherever on the globe they occur. They\r\ndiffer but little, whether found in the middle course of the Ganges,\r\nthe Indus, the Euphrates, or the American rivers. The still, incomplete\r\nstream of the St. Lawrence shows us, even in the present, what the\r\nancient conditions were before they solved the problem of their complete\r\ndevelopment. There, a row of such lakes as formerly existed in the now\r\nfruitful plains of the middle Rhine, the middle Danube, and central\r\nRussia, are the five great Canadian lakes. They still constitute the\r\nmiddle course of the river, and one pours itself directly into another,\r\neither over a gentle slope of land, or in a great cataract and rapids,\r\nsuch as we do not observe in the middle course of other streams, which\r\nare not, like the St. Lawrence, incomplete. Only when waterfalls\r\ndisappear can the inclination of rivers become a gradual one. The\r\nuniformity of the grade of their channel is, therefore, a sign that they\r\nhave attained to a complete development. In such, slight rapids remain,\r\ninstead of the ancient cataracts. The existence of those primeval falls\r\nwe find in all rivers, even in the Rhine and Danube. The rounded faces\r\nof the rocks which once were the barriers to the rivers’ course, and the\r\ndebris once swept down from the mountains and deposited over the bottom\r\nof the ancient lakes, show this.\r\n\r\nThe strongest instance of cataracts, resembling the ancient ones which\r\nconnected the lakes of nearly all the great rivers of the globe, is seen\r\nin the fall of Niagara. That cataract is an epitome of the falls of all\r\nother streams. The Niagara River conducts the water of Lake Erie, by a\r\nchannel 33 miles long, to Lake Ontario, 300 feet below it. At the Great\r\nFall the river plunges about 150 feet into a chasm which it has hollowed\r\nout from the soft stone between the two lakes. The cataract was formerly\r\nseven miles below its present location, and has been observed to be\r\nsteadily working backward since its discovery. In the distant future it\r\nwill, doubtless, wholly disappear, as all others have done. For the\r\nNiagara is merely a striking instance of a principle once universal, but\r\nwhich merely worked itself out on a smaller scale. The more fragments of\r\nrock and mountain debris were swept along, the sooner were the primitive\r\nfalls rent away by the wash and the percussion, and the development of\r\nthe middle course completed.\r\n\r\nThe places of transition which lie between the higher dry basins and\r\nthe lower ones are still to be traced in almost all rivers; not by\r\ngreat waterfalls, which belong only to the upper course, but by simple\r\nrapids. They are more or less characterized by narrows, with steep, rocky\r\nbanks, where, doubtless, cataracts existed in the primitive times. They\r\nare recognizable by this feature, that they are uniformly alike, and\r\ndistribute their force equally on both sides of the river. Examples may\r\nbe found on both sides of the Rhine, in the narrows between Bingen and\r\nBacharach; on the Elbe, from Tetshen to Shandau, Dresden, and Meissen.\r\nIn these places the rivers have a very tortuous course, and there are\r\nwhirls and rapids (rapides, sauts, of the French; saltos, randales, of\r\nthe Spanish; schewerin of the Russians) which impede navigation. In these\r\nlocalities the entire aspect of nature is changed, and the landscape\r\nbecomes exceedingly beautiful. Here we find ancient narrow roadways;\r\nhere are places of great historic interest, and of great interest to the\r\nnaturalist, assuredly not of accidental origin, but in close connection\r\nwith the development of the river bed, and in close analogy with all\r\nplaces of transition from highland to lowland.\r\n\r\nWe may, perhaps, mark these features in all the rivers of the earth.\r\nA knowledge of them is essential to understand thoroughly the natural\r\ndevelopment of a river system in its true parts; unfortunately, they\r\nhave as yet been too little observed and described. Among European rivers\r\nthey are found in the Guadiana, at the Saltos de Lobo; in the Douro,\r\nat the rapids below Torre de Moncorvo; in the Ebro, at Sastago, below\r\nSaragossa; in the Rhone, the rapids below Lyons, between the granite\r\nbanks of Pierre Encise; in Loire, by Iguerando, below Roanne; in the\r\nRhine, below Strasbourg, and at the narrows at Bingen, near St. Goar and\r\nAndernach; in the Weser, at the Porta Westphalica; in the Danube, at\r\nGrein, at Kloster Newburg, and at Yachtali, Drenir Kapi, (Iron Gate,) and\r\nOrsova; and in the Dnieper, the thirteen waterfalls below Yekaterinslav.\r\nThe same features are repeated in all the other streams of Europe and\r\nthe remaining continents. More close investigation of them will lead to\r\nimportant results, concerning the structure of the earth in the regions\r\nintermediate between plateaus and lowlands.\r\n\r\nAs a high grade, great cataracts, sharp and bold cliffs, and mountain\r\nlakes characterize the upper course of streams, so rapids, dry lake\r\nbasins, and a meandering channel characterize their middle course. Below\r\nthe lowest rapids are found the level plains or lowlands which give\r\nrivers their third characteristic.\r\n\r\n\r\nLower Course.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the rivers break through the lowest range of hills which once\r\nbeset their course, they deposit the debris which they bear with them,\r\nand begin the formation of diluvial plains. We find in the soil of all\r\nlevel places along the middle, as well as the lower course of rivers,\r\ntraces of the same kinds of rock and minerals, which characterize the\r\nmountains where they rise. The rate of fall in the lower course of rivers\r\nis so slight as to be almost imperceptible. Relatively, it is the\r\ngreatest in the Volga; from Kamishin to the Caspian the descent is more\r\nthan 150 feet, although the distance is less than 500 miles. The Senegal,\r\nfrom Podor to the sea, a distance of about 200 miles, falls only about 2½\r\nfeet; the Amazon, within about the same distance, falls only 10½ feet, or\r\nabout an inch to the mile. In such rivers, therefore, the tide can flow a\r\nvery long way inland.\r\n\r\nThis gives rise to a great conflict of forces—the pressure of the stream\r\nin its natural flow, heightened at the appropriate season by the annual\r\ninundation, and the backward pressure of the tidal wave. Before these\r\nforces come into equilibrium, the river bed is constantly changing. The\r\nriver proper seeks this equilibrium by a parting of its channel, dividing\r\ninto two mouths, as in the Nile, or into more than one, as in the Rhine\r\nand Danube, or several (about 65) in the Volga. The momentum of the\r\nstream, the resistance of the tide, and the consequent slow speed of the\r\ncurrent promote the fall of deposits along the lower course of rivers.\r\nBelow the surface the result of these deposits is found in sand banks\r\nor bars; above the surface, as low, marshy land, the deltas, subject to\r\nfrequent inundation. We see this in the Rhine, the Nile, the Euphrates,\r\nthe Indus, the Ganges, the Mississippi—in all, about fourteen of the\r\nfirst-class rivers of the globe. The contrary feature, single, broad\r\nmouths not yet filled up by alluvial deposits, negative deltas, or deep\r\nocean inlets, can be observed in nine others of the largest rivers—the\r\nObi, Yenisei, St. Lawrence, Columbia, La Plata—mostly found, however, in\r\nthe north of the earth, where there is very little of the more loose and\r\nfruitful soil which more southern rivers bear onward from the mountains\r\nwhere they rise.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity of the lower course is seen in the extraordinary\r\nchanges in the river bed—the shifting of the channel from one side to the\r\nother. This is the natural result of the very light and movable character\r\nof the deposits brought down from above, and the strong pressure of the\r\ncurrent, which, though slow, has great momentum. In the lower course\r\nof the Ganges, Indus, Euphrates, Nile, Rhine, and Po, these changes\r\ncan be traced as a matter of history, and, in the lapse of centuries,\r\nhave had great influence on the formation of the great plains of those\r\nrivers’ mouths and on the people living there. With the lower course\r\nbegins the regular yearly inundations, which cover vast districts in\r\ntropical countries; and to these inundations may be attributed the\r\ngradual raising of the level of the plains covered by them. Hence arose\r\nHerodotus’ descriptive phrase ποταμοὶ ἐργατιχοί, (prolific rivers.) The\r\ngreat fruitfulness of these lowlands is well known. The rich alluvial\r\ndeposits have made Bengal, Babylonia, Egypt, Lombardy, Holland, and the\r\nNetherlands the granaries of all neighboring countries.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the mouth of great rivers resembles an inland sea,\r\nhaving a strongly marked tidal flow in sympathy with the ocean, does the\r\nwhole nature of the lower course vary. The rivers whose mouths are turned\r\nto the east and south are those which are exposed to the strongest and\r\nthe highest ocean waves. Such are Chinese, Indian, and South American\r\nrivers, which sometimes show the result of this, 500 miles inland. The\r\ntide extending so far into the interior facilitates navigation very much,\r\nand transforms the lowlands along their margin into districts, which seem\r\ntransitional between true continent and oceanic islands. All the mouths\r\nof first-class rivers which open toward the north and west are less\r\ndeeply affected by the entrance of the sea waves. To these belong most\r\nof the European streams. Exceptional to both of these classes are the\r\nthree rivers, the Nile, Danube, and Volga, whose direction is not toward\r\nthe ocean, but toward the center of the Old World. They form a triad,\r\nnot of oceanic, but of continental streams; in them there is no ebb and\r\nflood. Their lower course and mouths must, therefore, display different\r\nrelations from those of any other of the great rivers of the globe.\r\n\r\nIt was early remarked that not all streams, when they reach the sea, flow\r\nat once into it, but come to a standstill. It is so with the Thames, and\r\nwith most of the North American rivers. The ocean sometimes throws a\r\ntidal wave twenty to thirty feet high up their channel, and dams their\r\nflow. Rivers vary exceedingly in their relations to this high barrier.\r\nThe Chinese streams are sometimes raised forty feet by it above their\r\nnormal level. This gives rise to a salt oceanic river, so to speak. It\r\nis the same with the Thames at London. At high tide the surface is salt,\r\nwhile the water at the bottom is fresh. The struggle with the downward\r\ncurrent and the upward current is very often visible. It is so in the\r\nOrinoco, the Ganges, in the Chinese rivers; most of all, in the St.\r\nLawrence.\r\n\r\nIn all the continents there are many small rivers and rivulets which\r\nhave no normal mouths; which lose themselves in the earth before they\r\nreach the sea. Sometimes they pursue a subterranean course, and emerge\r\nagain, though usually with a changed name. Among the best-known of such\r\ninstances is the Perte du Rhone, below Geneva, where the river flows\r\nfor a little way directly beneath a spur of the Jura Mountains. In like\r\nmanner, the Meuse, which loses itself in the earth at Bazoilles, in the\r\nVosges Mountains, west of Nancy, flows in a subterranean bed as far as\r\nNoncourt, nine miles distant, and then emerges. The phenomenon is common\r\namong the Jura, and in the limestone cliffs which feed the Drave and\r\nSave. The tourist meets almost hourly there some brook or little river\r\ndisappearing beneath the ground. On the high Asiatic plateau of Gobi,\r\n68 rivers are known, which disappear in a similar manner; in the north\r\nof Thibet there are 115 such. They are common, also, in the Chinese\r\nprovince of Yun-nan, on the Persian highland, and on the plateau of the\r\nBechuanas, in South Africa. In South America, between the Andes and the\r\nLa Plata, there are twelve lakes without effluents, the greatest being\r\nLake Titicaca. In Central America, there is the Lake of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe division of the whole length of a river into the three courses—the\r\nupper, middle, and lower—and the proportionate share which each of these\r\nbears to the whole, depends upon the height at which the source stands\r\nabove the mouth. The greater or less extent of the transition grades,\r\nand the greater or less extent of navigable waters, also depend on the\r\nsame. The upper course has, as a general rule, too many hinderances to\r\nbe very valuable for navigation; it is, at best, adapted only to boats.\r\nThe more united and deeper middle course offers facilities for vessels of\r\nconsiderable draught; yet the frequent sunken rocks and eddies and rapids\r\nare a great impediment to navigation. We find it so in the Rhine, below\r\nthe Falls of Schaffhausen, as far as Bâle; and in its middle course, at\r\nBingen and St. Goar; in the Danube, also, at Grein and Orsova.\r\n\r\nThe lower course, on the other hand, opens like a broad fresh-water sea,\r\nthat sometimes allows large ships to sail 50, 200, and even 500 miles\r\ninland. These maritime streams ought to be discriminated from others;\r\nthe Chinese call them “sons of the ocean.”\r\n\r\nThe proportions in the length of the upper, middle, and lower course of\r\nrivers are exceedingly variable; and equally variable of course are the\r\ntransition lands apportioned to each, and forming its natural supplement.\r\nThe upper course of the Volga is very short, the middle very long,\r\nand the lower very short. The same relative proportions, though with\r\nvery different dimensions, are found in the Vistula, the Ganges, the\r\nEuphrates, and the Mississippi. The upper course of the Rhine, on the\r\ncontrary, is very long, through all Switzerland to Bâle; the middle also\r\nvery long, to Cologne; the lower, very short, to Rotterdam and the sea.\r\nIt is the same with the Nile, the Danube, and the Indus. In the Marañon\r\nor Amazon the upper course is very short, the middle and lower very long.\r\nIn the Chinese rivers Hoang-ho and Yang-tse-Kiang all the three courses\r\nare relatively long.\r\n\r\nThe length of the middle and lower courses, although important\r\nconditions of navigation, are not the only ones. Others are not to be\r\noverlooked,—the amount of water, depth of channel, and the like. These,\r\nhowever, are not capable of being generalized under any law, but depend\r\nupon the individual characteristics of each stream. Every river needs,\r\nfor an exhaustive account of its features, its own monograph.\r\n\r\nThere remains but one important point to be considered—one which has\r\nexerted a very great influence on the diversity of structure in all river\r\nsystems, controlling the area of their drainage, their volume of water,\r\ntheir effect on human culture, and on the ethnographic character of the\r\npeople dwelling on their banks. It is the distance from the source to\r\nthe mouth in direct distance compared with that following the tortuous\r\ncourse of the stream. The two lines almost never coincide; they generally\r\nlie far apart. And the less they approach to coincidence, the greater\r\nbecomes the area of the river basin; the more numerous and valuable the\r\ntributaries to the main course, the greater the volume of the stream and\r\nthe more varied and extensive its influence.\r\n\r\nOne or two examples drawn from European rivers will more fully explain\r\nthis point, to which Buache has already called attention in his\r\n“Parallèle des fleuves.”\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the Volga is 982 miles distant from the source, in an\r\nair-line. The distance, including all the curves of the stream, is 2012\r\nmiles, the bendings adding 1028 miles to the direct course. By this\r\ndoubling of the shortest possible distance, the area drained by it is\r\nswollen to the enormous size of 657,000 square miles. The direct course\r\nlies in a diagonal direction from northwest to southeast; but the real\r\ndirection is a changing one. First, it flows a short distance from north\r\nto south, then in its middle course it has a double direction; first\r\neastward, toward the Ural chain, then to the south, and lastly, in its\r\nlower course, to the southeast. Through this varied course it receives\r\ntributaries from very remote sources, and waters a country altogether\r\ngreater than would be possible if the Volga’s course were direct from the\r\nsource to the mouth. Its basin becomes so large as to embrace a fifth of\r\nEurope, and the stream becomes one of the longest and most available for\r\nnavigation in the continent. The vastness of the volume of water and the\r\nwandering course have both contributed to the value of the Volga lowlands.\r\n\r\nThe exact contrast to the Volga is found in the Dniester. In the Volga\r\nthere is a maximum of windings; in the Dniester there is a minimum. The\r\nair-line distance of the mouth of the Dniester from the source is 408\r\nmiles; the distance, including all the bends, is 450 miles; the loss in\r\nwinding is, therefore, but about 42 miles. The theoretical course of the\r\nDniester, _i.e._ measured by an air-line, would coincide very nearly with\r\nits actual course. There cannot be, therefore, any distant springs whose\r\nwaters flow into its channel; its basin is one of the most contracted in\r\nthe world in consequence of its directness; and a small belt, embracing\r\nbut 32,850 square miles, comprehends the entire district that it drains,\r\nfreed from all those tributaries which make the Volga basin so important.\r\n\r\nThe Dnieper, its eastern neighbor, is 630 miles in direct distance from\r\nthe source to the mouth, but 1000 with all its windings; leaving 370\r\nmiles as the extraneous shore, which adds to the value of the basin, and\r\ncontributes to the 219,000 square miles which it drains.\r\n\r\nThe same contrast is seen elsewhere, though not on so extended a scale.\r\nIt is to be found in the Vistula, Oder, Elbe, Weser, Rhine, and Danube.\r\nThese rivers give shape to the transition terraces between broad eastern\r\nEurope and the more contracted western portions of the continent; their\r\ndimensions are, therefore, on a less extensive scale than in the great\r\nRussian streams. Still, the differences in them are worthy of notice.\r\n\r\nIn the Vistula, the direct distance from the source to the mouth is\r\n329 miles, and the real distance is 611 miles; the windings comprise,\r\ntherefore, 280 miles, or about two-thirds of the air-line from extreme to\r\nextreme. It becomes able to receive a large number of tributaries, and\r\nits basin is enlarged to an area of 78,402 square miles, becoming one of\r\nthe best-watered and most fruitful on the globe.\r\n\r\nIn the Oder, the direct distance from the source to the mouth is about\r\nthe same as in the Vistula. But while the latter frequently changes its\r\ncourse, running first northward, then eastward to the Sau, then northward\r\nagain to the Bug, then westward to the Drewenz, and lastly northward,\r\nand so gains a very large basin of drainage, the former is unvarying in\r\nits course from southeast to northwest; so that the direct line drawn\r\nfrom extreme to extreme, as the bird flies, is nearly coincident with\r\nthe actual course of the river. The windings do not, at most, comprise\r\none-third of the whole length of the stream, and the basin drained by its\r\ntributaries is at least a third less than that of the Vistula, and is\r\nproportionately less valuable to the interests of the world.\r\n\r\nIn the Elbe the air-line length is 394 miles, greater therefore, than\r\nthat of the Vistula or the Oder; its length, including its windings,\r\nis about the same as that of the Vistula. The area of its basin lies\r\ntherefore between the two, 61,320 square miles; it is more valuable,\r\ntherefore, than that of the Oder, and less valuable than that of the\r\nVistula.\r\n\r\nStill less striking in this respect are the Weser and the Ems; but the\r\nRhine assumes a prominence, in relation to the value of its basin,\r\ngreater than even the Vistula. The direct distance from the source of\r\nthe Rhine to its mouth is 423 miles, the actual distance 705 miles; the\r\nwindings comprise, therefore, more than two-thirds of the entire length\r\nof the stream. The number of tributaries is uncommonly large, the area\r\ndrained is increased about 9855 miles beyond that of the Vistula; and the\r\nentire basin (88,257 square miles) is one which has been of the greatest\r\nimport in the history of all central Europe.\r\n\r\nAll the rivers and all the terrace lands of the globe exhibit the same\r\nrelation which we have been briefly indicating in a few European ones;\r\nin some of the great rivers of the world they are to be traced on a scale\r\nof grandeur of which in those which have been touched upon scarcely a\r\nsuggestion is given.\r\n\r\nBut not in this feature, added to what has been already said, do we\r\nexhaust the fruitful subject of Rivers, and the terrace systems which\r\naccompany them from their source to the sea. The diversity of phenomena\r\ntraceable in them had hid their unity from geographers, and prevented\r\ntheir tracing general principles in so manifold details. The dry, linear\r\nrepresentations on most of our maps have blinded the eye to the living\r\nand organic relations which river systems enter into, and through which\r\nthey exert a great influence. They must be examined singly; they must be\r\nstudied in their real character and individuality, and each must have its\r\nown monograph, before we can fully know the value of river systems to the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nWe have now to touch upon one or two points omitted, thus far, in our\r\ndiscussion of the hydrography of the continents.\r\n\r\nThe stream is a unit; most streams have a single channel as the last\r\ngoal of their descent. Others may have double channels, which contend\r\nwith each other for the superiority. If they are double only for a part\r\nof the whole length of the river, and in the upper or middle course\r\nflow together, and form one main channel, they can be called twin\r\nhead-streams. We have an example in the Danube and Inn, which are equally\r\nlong and equally large. Other instances are the Rhone and the Saone, the\r\nVolga and Kama, the Missouri and Mississippi, the Blue and White Nile,\r\nthe Ganga and Jumna. Others have triple head-streams; as, for example,\r\nthe Hither, Middle, and Farther Rhine; the Ucayale, Huallaga, and\r\nMarañon, which combine in the middle course to form the Amazon. There\r\nmay be even five head-streams, as in the Indus. Often it is only through\r\nthe usage of speech, often through ancient and exploded errors, that the\r\nname of one of the head-streams is given to the whole river.\r\n\r\nIf the double channels continue through the whole length of the river\r\nsystem, they belong to a different category; they become true double\r\nsystems, and have a double influence on the development of the whole\r\nrange of terraces from source to base. From their meeting in a common\r\nbay or gulf at the mouth, they may be called sister-streams; and, from\r\nthe territory which they inclose between them, the Mesopotamia, they\r\nmay be called Mesopotamic streams. Between such double streams some of\r\nthe greatest States of Asia lie. Universally known, on account of their\r\ninfluence on Asiatic culture, are the Euphrates and Tigris uniting in the\r\nPersian Gulf, Ganges and Brahmapootra uniting in the Bay of Bengal, Gihon\r\nand Sihon in the Sea of Aral, Hoang-ho and Yang-tse-Kiang encompassing\r\nthe Central Flowery Country of the Chinese Empire, and meeting in a\r\ncommon delta. These double streams are mostly met in Asia, and they have\r\nexercised a great influence on the whole growth of oriental civilization.\r\n\r\nIn South America there is yet another and more complex form yet of river\r\nsystem. The Amazon is connected with the Orinoco by means of the little\r\ncross-river Cassiquiare. By this connection the middle course of both\r\nrivers is made more available to navigation than it would otherwise have\r\nbeen. Such cross-streams may be found, though on a smaller scale, in\r\nother continents; in Africa, for example, between the Senegal and the Rio\r\nGrande. There a network is made between the parallel rivers, but it is\r\navailable for navigation only in the wet seasons. In Central Africa there\r\nseems to be a similar phenomenon between the eastern tributaries of Lake\r\nTchad and the western tributaries of the Bahr el Abiad or White Nile,\r\nthough this rests on the authority of the Arabs. In India there appears\r\nto be a similar connection between the middle course of the Indus and the\r\nJumna, and so the Ganges, by the mediation of the Sarasvati or Histara\r\nand the Gharghara. There may have been the same in Central China, between\r\nthe Hoang-ho and the Kiang, where the Imperial Canal now runs; and a\r\nsimilar feature may be found in the Lithuanian marshes, connecting the\r\nVistula and Dnieper river systems, through the mediation of the Bug and\r\nthe Przypec. The skill of man has, in many places, accomplished the same\r\nend by the construction of canals.\r\n\r\nAlthough all rivers, in the course of their development, follow the\r\nuniversal law which leads them from their source, however high, to\r\nthe sea, yet there is, even in their descent, scope for exceedingly\r\nvaried phenomena. It is not necessary that everywhere a strongly-marked\r\nline of water-shed should exist, but often, as in all the more level\r\nplateaus, there are broad, neutral plains which perform the function of\r\nwater-sheds, though possessing no decisive character. It is so through\r\na great part of Central Asia, in the low plains of Australia, probably\r\nin a large part of Africa, and so markedly in America, that all lines of\r\nwater-shed wholly disappear, and the rivers flow confusedly together,\r\nwithout any system, and in obedience to no law.\r\n\r\nSome rivers come down the sides of high mountains in torrents, then\r\ncourse around in a long, winding course, turning out for all obstacles,\r\nand at last find the sea. Others are entirely unlike them. The Ganges\r\nflows from the south side of the Himalaya Mountains, and courses along\r\ntheir base, following the direction of the chain in a southeasterly\r\ndirection, till it reaches the Bay of Bengal. The Indus springs from the\r\nnorth side of the Himalaya, flows northwest over the plateau of Little\r\nThibet as far as Iskardo, then breaks through the whole chain to pour\r\nitself out upon the lowlands of India, the Punjaub, and Mooltan. Dashing\r\nits way through the most formidable barriers, it is entirely unlike the\r\ngentle Ganges, which pursues its tranquil course through the plains,\r\nmeeting no barrier in its entire length. The Indus, so long as it remains\r\nnorth of the Himalaya, traverses a plateau 10,000 feet above the sea;\r\nwhile the Ganges, even at Delhi, is but 1000 feet above the sea. Both\r\nrivers, although represented in precisely the same way upon the maps,\r\nhave an entirely different physical character.\r\n\r\nThe same difference in structure occurs in the streams of other\r\ncontinents, and even in those of Central Europe, though on a less\r\ncolossal scale. There are, therefore, classes of rivers, and they ought\r\nto be just as sharply discriminated as the classes in botany and zoology.\r\n\r\nPlateau streams, such as the Danube, as far as the Lower Austrian and\r\nHungarian plains, and the Saone, down to its confluence with the Rhone,\r\npass through high, uniform plains with little fall. They are genuine\r\nmountain followers, springing from the verge of the chain and crossing\r\nalong its base, the Saone taking the west side of the Alps, as the Danube\r\ndoes the northern, and the Po the southern.\r\n\r\nThe rivers which force their way through mountain ranges form a second\r\nclass. The Rhine, a free child of the Alps, from its source to the sea,\r\nbreaks through all the ranges up to the Jura; then it forces a path\r\nthrough all the mountains of Central Germany, till it comes to its lower\r\ncourse. It may, therefore, be classified with the Indus. It leaves\r\nthe Alps suddenly at Bâle, and opens a new and romantic way through\r\nno insignificant obstacle, and is everywhere a conqueror. That is the\r\npeculiarity of the Rhine.\r\n\r\nTwo streams of analogous nature, though less marked in their\r\ncharacteristics, are the Elbe and the Weser. But these both rise, not\r\namong the Alps, but amid the German mountains. They lack, therefore, the\r\nexceedingly romantic character of Alpine rivers; but they do not lack in\r\npicturesque scenery, and this they owe to the obstacles which they pass.\r\nThe Elbe has broken its way from the Bohemian ridge through the so-called\r\nSaxon-Switzerland, as far as Meissen, and the Weser from the fissures of\r\nthe Werra and the Fulda to the Porta Westphalica. The Elbe and the Weser\r\nmake, with the Rhine, the triad of Central European rivers, which have\r\nbroken a pathway for themselves through mountains which impeded their\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nA third class of rivers are those which encounter no obstacles, and flow\r\nin a placid stream from the source to the mouth. They extend in Europe\r\nfrom the Vistula to the Ems, including the Oder and excluding the Weser\r\nand Elbe, and from the Rhine along the whole Atlantic coast of France,\r\nembracing the Seine, Loire, Garonne, and the Adour—all of these having,\r\nin greater or less degree, the same hydrographical character.\r\n\r\nFrom these can be still further discriminated the subordinate coast\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nTo a fourth class belong all those tributary streams, of whatever size or\r\nlength, which agree in possessing no independent character, and do not\r\npour their waters into the sea through their own mouths.\r\n\r\nThe application of this system of classification can be applied to the\r\nstreams and their accompanying terrace lands in the other continents. But\r\nthese observations may suffice to indicate the general principles which\r\nwe would apply to the study of rivers, and leave to the student their\r\nfurther application.\r\n\r\n\r\nReview.\r\n\r\nThe great typical forms already considered, highland, plateau, mountain,\r\nlowland, terrace, and river, which all claim so large a share of\r\nattention in studying their physical characteristics, are no less worthy\r\nof careful attention, in consequence of their influence on human culture.\r\nOur account would not be complete without devoting a few pages to the\r\nconsideration of the manner in which nature and history have reacted on\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nThe most elevated highlands, the loftiest plateaus, uniform in their\r\naspect, immense in their extent, isolated, without trees, having the\r\nthin soil characteristic of steppes, and useful only for grazing, are\r\nthe home of the primitive nomadic races. Without forests and without\r\nshelter, without valleys and without water-courses, with sandy and rocky\r\nsoil, covered with a scanty vegetation, they serve only to supply food\r\nfor the gregarious animals which follow man, and to furnish a home to\r\nwandering tribes of herdsmen. Instances are found in Central Asia, in\r\nToorkistan and Persia, in Central Africa, including the Galla tribes and\r\nthe Abyssinians. So, too, among the high plateaus of America, the home\r\nof the primitive Aztecs. From such places came the first movements of\r\nemigration; from the high plateaus of Central Asia came the wandering\r\nPersians, Huns, Mongolians, and Turks; and the same course of emigration\r\nwas witnessed among the negro tribes of Central Africa, proceeding from\r\nthe Galla tribes. The lower highlands, less colossal in size, of more\r\nmoderate height, and of more genial temperature, have at all times\r\nreached a certain low stage of culture, after giving a home to the nomads\r\nfrom the higher plateau; but have never developed that culture to any\r\nconsiderable extent. We find examples of this in the high terraces of\r\nBootan, the Deccan, and Persia; in Africa, among the Atlas mountains;\r\nin Abyssinia, in the ancient Greek Arcadia, in Castile, in Arvernia,\r\n(Auvergne,) in Gallia, in Hesse, in the Eifel, and on the Valdai hills.\r\n\r\nIn the exceedingly complex, subdivided, and romantic mountain districts\r\nof the globe, the races have attained, by virtue of the variety of their\r\nresources and the energy of their stock, to the highest results of\r\ncivilization, and have manifested the most independent and progressive\r\nspirit. In such regions, hunting, working in wood, the settled life\r\nof shepherds, working in metals, agriculture on such terrace lands as\r\nthose of Nepaul, Cashmere, Palestine, the Lebanon, Apennine, and other\r\nranges, fruit culture, tilling vineyards, the cultivation of all kinds\r\nof industry, as in Central Germany and in most regions of the temperate\r\nzone, develop most thoroughly and speedily the culture of a people. In\r\nsuch occupations men learn to lean more on each other, and grow into\r\nthat diversity of occupation and division of labor, which are the latest\r\nresults of civilization. The Zend, the Sanscrit, and the Persian nations\r\nwhich people the fertile tracts at the base of the Himalaya Mountains,\r\nfrom Maghada, Lahore, Nepaul, and Cashmere, as far as Persepolis and\r\nHamadan, Susa and Shiraz, the inhabitants of the hill country of\r\nPalestine and Syria, those of the Tehama range of mountains in Arabia,\r\nthose in the moderately elevated meadows of Gondar, as well as those in\r\nall the European Alpine lands, Switzerland, Tyrol, Styria, as well as the\r\ninhabitants of the mountain region of Peru and Mexico, all attain to an\r\nearly and considerably advanced state of civilization. Other nations have\r\nfound in mountains asylums in time of danger—the Tsherkeses and Ossetes\r\namong the Caucasus, for instance, the Basques among the Pyrenees, and the\r\nGorals among the Carpathians.\r\n\r\nThe lowlands, as soon as the water had left them enough to make them\r\nhabitable, have become, from the first, the abodes of a teeming\r\npopulation; and there has been the same blending of races in the most\r\nancient as in the most recently settled, in China as in Texas, and, in\r\ntruth, all North America. Often these inroads of population have been a\r\nsource of injury, as has been the case in the northern Siberian plains,\r\nwhere the Finnish tribes have made their homes, and in the waste of\r\nSahara, where the Barbary tribes, the Bedouins, the Tibboos, and the\r\nTuaricks have made their retreat.\r\n\r\nOn the fruitful terraces, along the middle course of rivers, the earliest\r\nfixed habitations and ripened culture have been attained. Through the\r\ntraditional handing down of past results, and by the habits of peace,\r\ntheir inhabitants have more thoroughly subjected nature and advanced\r\nto a higher state of civilization than the dwellers in the interior,\r\naway from the rivers. It has been the same, in a great measure, with\r\nthe lower course, as, for instance, in Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, and\r\nBengal; and in Europe, in Lombardy, Holland, and the Netherlands, where,\r\nto the efforts to recover land from the sea, have been added fishing and\r\ncommerce. On such fruitful tracts as the mouths and middle courses of\r\nrivers water, nations could find a permanent home, and pass quickly to\r\nall liberal and refining arts and occupations. This is clear, from the\r\ninstances of the eminent monarchies of the East, Meroe, Thebes, Memphis,\r\nBabylon, Nineveh, Bagdad, and Mosul. So, too, on the Indus and Ganges, in\r\nthe domains of Taxila, Maghada, Benares; and later in the great empire,\r\nwhose centers were Agra and Delhi. China has arrived at its highest\r\ncivilization in the fertile district between its two greatest rivers.\r\nGreece and Rome are marked exceptions. Their progress they owe, not to\r\ngreat river basins, but to their peninsular form in the middle of the\r\ncoast of a delightful sea, full of islands and surrounded by lands in\r\na greater or less advanced state of civilization. England’s peculiar\r\nmaritime position has given it its wonderful vantage-ground for progress\r\nin all human culture.\r\n\r\nIn the east of Europe, the basins of rivers have exercised the same\r\ninfluence, to a certain extent, that has been hinted at above; and\r\nMoscow, Kiev, Cracow, and Warsaw remain the seats of a civilization\r\nwhich, rude as it was, owed its existence to the physical conditions of\r\nthe great Sarmatian river systems. In western Europe, the less marked\r\nfeatures of the country have contributed to the peculiar historical\r\ndevelopment of the continent. The rich deltas have become the granaries\r\nfor a large part of the population, allowing industry to flow into\r\nother channels besides agriculture. The sea-faring habits of the people\r\nalong the coast have broken up and done away with what is special and\r\nprovincial, and have conferred a cosmopolitan manner of living upon the\r\nentire population. It was the same with the Phenicians in ancient times,\r\nwith the Portuguese in the middle ages, as it has been with the English,\r\nSpanish, and Dutch in modern days. Fishing, navigation, and trade have\r\nbecome permanent necessities of civilization. In the heart of continental\r\nEurope, the rivers have had a great influence on the progress of nations;\r\nthe North German streams have extended their effect from the abode of the\r\nancient Saxons along the Baltic as far as the home of the Salic Franks on\r\nthe Scheldt, Seine, and Loire; the Danube, with its complex and important\r\nsystem of terraces and lowlands, has opened communication between South\r\nGermany and Hungary, Wallachia, and the East. The Vistula, Oder, Elbe,\r\nand Weser have connected the homes of the old Sclavic population with the\r\nScandinavian coasts and the land of the Angles and Saxons at the neck of\r\nDenmark, to the equal advantage of both. The great terrace system of the\r\nRhine, embracing the Odenwald, Hardt, Spessart, Taunus, Hundsrück, Eifel,\r\nand the Siebengebirg, has thrown into the most active industrial and\r\ncommercial relations the whole district which it waters. It opened a way\r\nto the Romans in their conquering advances before it did to the tribes of\r\nHelvetia, Gallia, Germania, or the Lowlands: it sundered those tribes,\r\nand kept them from preying upon each other; but, in the advance of\r\ncivilization, it has become one of the strongest bands to knit together\r\nthe central countries of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Danube, with its extensive terrace lands, faces the east, and has,\r\ntherefore, very different relations to European history from the Rhine.\r\nIt is a double-headed river, and one of its head-streams, the one which\r\nbears the name of the river proper, extends almost to the Rhine basin;\r\nwhile the other, the Jura, has its source in Grisons, and hard by the\r\nhead-waters of the Rhine. As the Danube connects the Caspian and Black\r\nSea basin with western Europe, and the largest part of the Asiatic\r\nimmigrations have followed its course, the Danube has become the great\r\navenue between Europe and Asia. Celts, Teutons, and Romans were mingled\r\neven before Christ, in Noricum, Vindelecia, Bavaria, and Suabia. How many\r\ntribes may have been crowded westward by these, is unknown to us. The\r\nsame fate has happened to the people who settled there before Christ,\r\nand the inroads of the Huns, Goths, and other tribes of similar origin,\r\nscattered the older inhabitants over all Central Germany. We know, too,\r\nthat Sclavic, Hungarian, and Turkish incursions followed, each one\r\ndispossessing wholly or in part the one which preceded it.\r\n\r\nAll great rivers and river systems have had a similar influence on the\r\ncourse of civilization. There is not a single type feature in the world\r\nwhich has not contributed its part to the advance of the human race; no\r\none is without its place and its function.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Configuration of the Continents.\r\n\r\nAll the divisions of the earth, taken together in their internal and\r\nexternal connections, in their mutual action and reaction, constitute\r\nthe unity of the globe, and make apparent that it is a simple organism,\r\ndesigned and created by divine skill, and intended to be the home of a\r\nrace whose culture should, in the course of centuries, unfold from the\r\nmost simple beginnings to the most complex and elaborate perfection.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the surface of the earth is naturally divided\r\ninto three typical features—highland, lowland, and the transition\r\nterraces between them. From the vertical and horizontal combination of\r\nthese result the most of the geographical forms which are the subject of\r\nour study. They form what we may, for convenience, call the bas-relief of\r\nthe globe.\r\n\r\nAt the creation of the earth every great continental division received\r\n(as every other organism has, regarded by itself, and not in relation to\r\nthe greater whole of which it forms a part) its own special form. Each\r\ncontinent is like itself alone; its characteristics are not shared by any\r\nother. Each one was so planned and so formed as to have its own special\r\nfunction in the progress of human culture. This may be seen by reviewing\r\nthe history of the past; this may fairly be suspected yet to be in the\r\nfuture. The individuality of each continent raises it to a place where\r\nits characteristics give it an independent character, and a capacity of\r\ndevelopment of itself, up to a certain point, but never beyond it. The\r\ncontinents are never to be regarded as high, dead masses of land, but as\r\nvital and effective instruments, working upon each other ceaselessly, and\r\nhelping each other to attain the consummation intended in the counsels of\r\nthe Divine Mind. The unity of the earth, the unity of the continents, the\r\nunity of every physical feature of the continents, and the building all\r\nup together in a perfect symmetry and mutual adaptation of parts, is the\r\ncrowning thought of Geographical Science.\r\n\r\nThe study of first causes has no less clear illustrations in the course\r\nof our investigations than elsewhere. It is the task of science to show\r\nthe nature and mutual relations of all the subjects which fall within\r\nthe scope of Natural History. The nature of the parts is only understood\r\nfrom a comprehension of the whole; not the reverse, however. That is a\r\nmost just saying of Plato. The knowledge of the universal cannot proceed\r\nfrom a knowledge of the special. As the part is formed only in view of\r\nand on account of the whole, in its study, dissociated from the whole,\r\nit becomes a mere unit and independent existence. From understanding the\r\nsolar system, we might arrive at a knowledge of the motion of the earth;\r\nand so, from a knowledge of the earth, we may advance to its continents,\r\ntheir relations, the characteristics of the different natural divisions,\r\ntheir subdivisions, their phenomena, and their living organization,\r\nembracing man, animals, and plants.\r\n\r\nThe external formation of the globe, or what we may call the\r\nconfiguration of the continents, rests upon two characteristics—the\r\nhorizontal and vertical dimensions.\r\n\r\n1. The horizontal dimensions are designated by the sea-line boundary—the\r\ngeographical limitation.\r\n\r\n2. The vertical dimensions—the physical limitation—are defined by the\r\nelevation of terraces and highlands, and they exhibit the greatest\r\ndiversity of phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe horizontal dimensions supply most of the material for our elementary\r\ncompends for political geography, which seldom make much account of\r\nvertical dimensions, and which, by no means, penetrate to their real\r\nvalue. They are commonly held to be a side-matter, to be touched lightly\r\nupon, or wholly cast aside. But both must be thoroughly studied; for\r\nthey are mutually dependent, and are never found divorced in nature. In\r\norder to understand them in their true relations, we will look at them\r\nin their general aspect, discussing first the horizontal extent of the\r\ncontinents, then their vertical elevation, so far as that has not already\r\nbeen treated. After this twofold investigation, the character of each\r\ncontinent and its subdivisions will appear in its true light.\r\n\r\nOn account of the importance of thoroughly understanding the articulation\r\nof great districts, in contradistinction to a mere division, which\r\nimplies no organic and living correlation of parts, and which gives over\r\nto mathematics, political history, and fortuitous circumstances the duty\r\nof explaining geographical phenomena, it is instructive to trace the\r\nfootsteps of our science back to some of the earlier conceptions.\r\n\r\nEratosthenes and Polybius were aware that the south of Europe was\r\na series of peninsulas, the first of the two speaking of the great\r\npeninsulas of Spain, Italy, and the Peloponnesus, the latter adding\r\nallusions to the smaller Grecian peninsula of Sunium, the Thracian\r\non the Bosporus, and the Tauric Chersonesus, now known as the Crimea.\r\nStrabo got a clearer insight into the significance of these forms,\r\n(whose meaning Hipparchus had already tried to explain,) by discussing\r\nthem according to the sea basins which they separate. Thus the Spanish\r\npeninsula separates the Gulf of Cadiz, at the Pillars of Hercules,\r\nfrom the Tyrrhene Sea; Italy separates the Sicilian Sea from the\r\nAdriatic; the Peloponnesus separates the Adriatic and the Euxine.\r\nThis view, though apparently simple, was really profound; for it\r\nhinted at the great significance of the maritime coast in developing\r\nthe civilization of those countries. And Strabo goes on to add that\r\nItaly, with its southeastern and southwestern extremities, becomes\r\ntoo pointed, (δικόρυφος,) and that the eastern peninsulas of Europe\r\nare much more jagged and articulated (ποικίλαι καὶ πολύμερεῖς) than\r\nPolybius had conceived them to be. He entered, therefore, upon a more\r\nminute subdivision. Strabo had already (ii. 92) called the Peloponnesus\r\n“many-parted,” (πολυ σχεδές,) as the Laconian peninsula (Tœnarum) is\r\nseparated from Malea, the Attic from Sunium, and all southern Europe\r\ncannot, therefore, be laid out in six parts. Of the north of Europe,\r\nStrabo was not in a position to gain any accurate conception. Toward\r\nthe end of his second book, where he gives his reason for beginning his\r\ndescription at the West, he uses the awkward but significant phrase\r\n“polymorphous formation,” to indicate the superiority which Europe\r\nenjoys in its complex articulation over the other continents. The\r\npassage in Strabo runs thus: “We begin with Europe, because it is so\r\nintricately organized, and is the most favorable for human culture, and\r\nhas conferred upon the other continents the most of the advantages which\r\nits position has secured for itself. It is habitable almost everywhere;\r\nthere is but a little portion of its territory too cold to be the home\r\nof man, etc. It enjoys an admirable physical conformation, for it is so\r\nperfectly harmonized in the mingling of plains and mountains, (ὅλη γάρ\r\nδιαπεποίκιλται πεδίας τε και ὅρεδιν,) that the city and the country are\r\nbrought together, and the people educated by equally favorable conditions\r\nto habits of great bravery. Europe is, therefore, complete in herself,\r\n(ἀμταρκεστάτη ἐστί.)” By this Strabo indicates the independent character\r\nof Europe, and its equality with the other continents, despite its\r\nsmaller size.\r\n\r\nYet for long centuries this insight of that keen observer into one of\r\nthe most weighty of all the physical conditions of the globe was almost\r\nwholly overlooked. At length, however, Humboldt brought it out into new\r\nlife in its climatological relations, and showed that it is one of the\r\nmost important considerations to base a study of the distribution of\r\nplants and animals upon, as well as for the study of almost all kinds of\r\nphysical phenomena. In his very instructive paper on the most prominent\r\nreasons for the variation in temperature on the globe, published in 1827,\r\nhe uses the significant expression: “Our Europe is indebted for its mild\r\nclimate, to its position, and its articulated form.” We have adhered to\r\nthe same view, and have expanded it in a paper[7] called The Geographical\r\nPosition and Horizontal Extension of the Continents, as well as in all my\r\nlectures.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Superficial Dimensions and Articulation of the Continents.\r\n\r\nWe proceed from the more simple to the more complex forms, and begin,\r\ntherefore, with Africa, which has the most uniform contour of all the\r\ncontinents.\r\n\r\nAfrica, the true South of the earth, is distinguished from all the other\r\ngreat divisions of the earth by its almost insular form and its unbroken\r\noutline. It is separated from Asia merely by the Isthmus of Suez,\r\nscarcely 70 miles wide. But it is of altogether more virgin a nature than\r\nAsia, and has been encroached upon by scarcely any foreign influence.\r\nAfrica is a unit in itself; the most exclusive of continents, its\r\nperiphery is almost a perfect ellipse. With the exception of the single\r\nGulf of Guinea on the west side, the continent is a true oval. Its linear\r\ndimensions are almost equal in length and breadth. It extends about 35°\r\non each side of the equator, and is about 70° of longitude in width. The\r\nlength and breadth are both about 5000 miles.\r\n\r\nThe periphery of its coast is the most simple and unbroken in the world.\r\nA single glance at the map is sufficient to show this. Nowhere are there\r\nthe deep arms of the sea and the sinuous shores of other continents. The\r\nGulf of Guinea is all. The entire length of its coast-line is but 16,000\r\nor 17,000 miles, not much more than the circumference of a circle whose\r\ndiameter is 5000 miles. Its coast-line, proportioned to its area, being\r\nthe shortest on the globe, gives Africa the least contact with the ocean\r\nof all the continents, and subjects it to the least amount of oceanic\r\ninfluences.\r\n\r\nThus all individualization of the various phases of life—vegetable,\r\nanimal, and human—is denied to this continent, whose extremities, on\r\naccount of the equality of its dimensions, lie equally far removed from\r\nthe central point. The similar size and configuration of the two lobes\r\nnorth and south of the equator create no strong contrasts, and give\r\nrise merely to tropical and sub-tropical conditions. All the phenomena\r\nof this great division, the real South of the earth, in which all the\r\nculminations of the tropical world are found, are therefore more uniform\r\nthan in any other part of the world. The characteristics of race remain\r\nin their primitive condition, and have made no progress with the lapse\r\nof time: this region seems to be kept as the refuge of a yet undeveloped\r\nfuture. Only general, never individual and special development in the\r\nworld of plants, animals, nor man, appear upon this stationary soil; the\r\npalm, the camel, and their natural companions appear in equal numbers\r\nin the northern, southern, eastern, and western extremities; the negro\r\nis almost exclusively the only inhabitant of the continent. There is no\r\nstriking individuality apparent in the culture, stature, organization,\r\nnor popular characteristics of its various parts. Even a common\r\nfoundation language gives rise to mere dialectical differences. A mere\r\nsporadic coast-culture gives rise to mere exceptions here and there, and\r\nthese are generally the result, not of inward progress, but of imported\r\nforeign conditions.\r\n\r\nAsia, the Orient, is wholly unlike Africa. On three sides it is entirely\r\nsea-girt—the south, the east, and the north; on the west only partly,\r\nabout 1400 miles. On the west, too, it is connected with Africa, but not\r\nin a way to insure any necessary relations between the two continents.\r\nBut with Europe it stands in the most intimate connection, forming a\r\nsingle body with it, of which Europe is really but a great western\r\npeninsula. Europe, the Occident of the Old World, is therefore for\r\nless widely severed from its Orient than from its real South or Africa.\r\nThe history of Asia and that of Europe are woven with a twisted strand;\r\nthey form a single thread, and their populations are far more closely\r\nconnected in physical and spiritual organizations than are the people of\r\nAsia and Africa.\r\n\r\nAsia, instead of being a simple oval, approaches the trapezoidal form,\r\nand consequently enters into a new set of relations resulting from its\r\nconfiguration. With the deeply-penetrating gulfs and bays and seas\r\nwhich sink into its trunk, the prominent peninsulas are in direct\r\ncorrespondence, marking in an especial manner the eastern and southern\r\ncoast, but not lacking on the northern and western. These peninsulas are\r\nto be regarded as the limbs of a great central continental trunk. The\r\neastern ones are the Tchooktchee foreland, the peninsulas of Kamtchatka\r\nand Corea, and the Chinese foreland. The southern ones are the peninsula\r\nof Farther India, including Tonquin, Siam, Malacca, and Birmah; the\r\npeninsulas of Hindostan, or Deccan and Arabia. The western limb is the\r\npeninsula of Asia Minor or Australia. The northeast of Asia is less\r\narticulated; still it has a number of arms pointing southward—the Sea of\r\nKara, the Gulf of Obi and Yenisei, for example. The whole Siberian coast\r\neven is far more serrated than that of Africa, where it is an almost\r\nunbroken line.\r\n\r\nStill, there remains in the interior of Asia a broad and long mass of\r\nthe continent, which is penetrated by no seas. It is to be regarded as\r\nthe real trunk, and preponderates immensely over the area of all the\r\nconfined projections. Asia is, therefore, a trunk with profuse richness\r\nof articulation. Africa is a trunk without articulation: a mere compact\r\ncontinental mass.\r\n\r\nThe immense influence which so complex a coast form has upon all physical\r\nphenomena and on all organic life is evident. Far greater results must\r\ncome from the mutual influence of sea and land than from unbroken land;\r\nfar more numerous influences upon the climate, and upon plants, animals,\r\nand man. Even the changing geological structure of the coast-line must\r\nhave an effect, when blending with all these other influences, greater\r\nthan it would have in the interior. Every part of the coast has become\r\ndifferent from every other part, with a different hydrographic and\r\nclimatic character; and the great increase of races of men, and species\r\nof plants and animals, was a natural result. While Africa remained\r\nlimited in all its relations, and destitute of any richness of variety,\r\nAsia has always enjoyed an amazing fertility of resources. Instead of\r\nthe three races or species of man found in Africa—Negro, Berber, and\r\nCaffre—many are met in Asia, all different, Tchooktchees, Kamtchadales,\r\nCoreans, Chinese, Malays, Bermese, Hindoos, Afghans, Persians, Arabs, and\r\nArmenians. And these belong merely to the coast-line.\r\n\r\nBut the contrast of the great central region to the broken coast is so\r\ngreat and complete, that the advanced culture along the sea-line has not\r\npenetrated far into the interior, nor changed the habits of the nomadic\r\ntribes which fill Central Asia, and whose representatives we have in\r\nthe Mongolians, Toorkomans, Kirgheez, Bukharians, Calmucks, etc. Still\r\nless could it reach the distant north, to which, with all the splendor\r\nwhich we associate with everything oriental, the civilization of the\r\nsouthern coasts is utterly wanting. To this element of superficial size,\r\nthe immense and almost insuperable obstacles which Nature has placed so\r\nthickly in Asia may be added, and also the immense variety of natural\r\nproductions which climates so different as those of the different parts\r\nof the continent exhibit. Extending from the equator to the north frigid\r\nzone, Asia affords a home for the most diversified kinds of plants and\r\nanimals, and shows, too, hardly less variety in its eastern and western\r\nextremes than in its northern and southern. The characteristics of the\r\nChinese flora and fauna are very widely different from those of Hither\r\nAsia. In the east, we have the sago-tree and the tiger; in the west, the\r\ndate-palm and the lion. The north gives us moss, the coniferæ, and the\r\nreindeer, in contrast with the bread-fruit tree, the sugar-cane, the\r\nbroad-leaved banana, the elephant, rhinoceros, tapir, and monkey of the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nThe inexhaustibleness of the Asiatic continent is not more visible in all\r\nthis wealth of productivity than in the abundance as well as the variety\r\nof human life. Though Asia has been the mother of the world, and has sent\r\nout so many and so eminent races, it has not been to the depletion of\r\nthe parent country. In race, figure, color, manner of life, nationality,\r\nreligion, political and social bonds of union, forms of government,\r\nculture, language, it is so richly diversified, that no continent, viewed\r\nhistorically, can be compared to it. Asia seems to have been created to\r\nsend forth its fruitful scions of life to all the other great divisions\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\nEurope, the Occident. The smallest of the three continents of the Old\r\nWorld, its superficial contents are the largest in proportion to the\r\namount of coast-line. Only on the east side has it a land frontier; and\r\nthere it has its widest extent from north to south. Like Asia, it is\r\nbordered on three sides by the ocean. Asia seems like a mighty trunk,\r\nat whose western extremity the broken and serrated Occident is found,\r\nadvancing in breadth from north to south, but articulating into arms of\r\nvarious size from east to west, till it loses itself in the peninsulas of\r\nthe Atlantic coast. The nearer to Asia, the broader is Europe, and the\r\nmore akin to the Asiatic character; the farther from it, the more minute\r\nbecome its subdivisions, and the more varied its character.\r\n\r\nTaken in a general way, the proportion of the truly continental part of\r\nEurope to the maritime districts is much less than is the case in Asia.\r\nIts contrast with Africa is, of course, yet more striking.\r\n\r\nEurope begins at the east, at the foot of the Ural and Caucasus, and\r\nat the steppes of West Asia. It does not take, as Asia and Africa do,\r\n(which are alike in this,) a trapezoidal or oval form, but in its linear\r\ndimensions there is a great difference between its length and breadth. By\r\nthe diminution of its width, as we go westward, and by the increase of\r\nits articulation, the number of its internal relations increases toward\r\nthe Atlantic. A great falling off in the oriental character which has\r\nlargely encroached upon Russia, and a constant increase of an independent\r\nspirit, is the sure result of natural conditions, and is experienced\r\nin all life and in things material as well as intellectual and moral.\r\nThe configuration here wins a palpable victory over mere quantity, and\r\nthe exceedingly varied coast gives to all European institutions their\r\ndistinctive character.\r\n\r\nBeginning with a breadth of about 1400 miles at the east, the continent\r\ngradually diminishes in width to 1000, 500, and even to 250 miles. Its\r\nfirst narrowing is visible between the Gulf of Riga and the Bay of\r\nOdessa; the next is between the Baltic and the Gulf of Trieste; the next,\r\nbetween the Zuider-Zee and the Gulf of Genoa; the next, between the\r\nEnglish Channel at Calais and the Gulf of Lyons; and the last, between\r\nBayonne and Perpignan.\r\n\r\nWith almost three times as great a length as breadth, Europe extends for\r\na distance of over 300 miles from the southern part of the Ural chain\r\nand from the Caucasus to the extremities of the bold coast of Spain and\r\nPortugal, Capes Finistère and St. Vincent. In this way the continent\r\nassumes very nearly the form of a right-angled triangle, the right angle\r\nlying at the Caspian, the base extending westward to Cape Finistère,\r\nthe perpendicular running northward along the Ural Mountains to the\r\nVaigats Straits, and the hypothenuse connecting the two extremities.\r\nThe area embraced within this triangle would be not far from 2,200,000\r\nsquare miles. Such a triangle, however, is not exact,—it is but an\r\napproximation to mathematical precision; but it is clearly enough marked\r\nto be traced upon our map, or, as a spherical triangle, upon our globes.\r\nAll geographical forms have only a more or less remote approach to\r\nmathematical exactness, but enough to aid us very much in representing\r\nthem and showing their relations.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the greater and really important extremities of the continent\r\nlie outside of the triangle above indicated; and this method of treatment\r\nonly serves to call attention to the great central mass, which would\r\notherwise be in danger of being overlooked, in view of the immense value\r\nand influence of the countries on the coast and beyond the triangular\r\nline of demarkation. It needs but a glance to see how the projecting\r\nshores have marred all the theoretical precision of such a line.\r\n\r\nThe coast-line shows itself directly subject to almost boundless\r\ndiversity. Toward the west the independence of each peninsula increases,\r\nthe more evidently and prominently according to its distance from Asia.\r\nNot articulated on two sides alone, like Asia, the east and south, but\r\non all three of its sides exposed to the ocean, the broken coast-line is\r\nuniversal in Europe,—even toward the colder north, where its peninsulas\r\nand adjacent islands almost inclose two seas, the North and the Baltic.\r\nThe advantage which this gives to Europe over Asia in respect to the\r\ndevelopment of its more northern regions, is very great and evident.\r\n\r\nWe will enumerate the leading peninsulas of Europe:\r\n\r\nKola, on the White Sea, between Lake Enara, the Varanger Fiord, and the\r\nBay of Kandalaska, pointing westward.\r\n\r\nScandinavia, embracing Norway and Sweden, with an area of more than\r\n350,000 square miles, a tenth of all Europe, connected with the main\r\nland by the isthmus of Finland, but otherwise girded in a great bow by\r\nthe Atlantic, the North Sea, the Baltic, and the Gulf of Bothnia, and\r\npointing southward.\r\n\r\nJutland or Denmark, beginning at the Elbe and the Trave and running\r\nnorth, embracing about ¹⁄₁₆₀ of Europe, between the North Sea and the\r\nBaltic, low and flat.\r\n\r\nThe subdivided peninsula of Holland, between the Rhine and the Ems, a\r\nflat plain, looking to the north.\r\n\r\nThe peninsula of Normandy and Brittany, between the Seine and the Loire,\r\na rocky granite formation, jutting out into the Atlantic and faced by\r\nbold precipices.\r\n\r\nSpain and Portugal, embracing about 220,000 square miles, about ¹⁄₁₆\r\nof Europe, rhomboidal in shape, almost insular in position, turned\r\nsouthwesterly, its surface a series of constantly rising terraces.\r\n\r\nItaly, embracing ¹⁄₃₅ of Europe, between the Alps and Sicily, and\r\ntraversed by a mountain range.\r\n\r\nTurkey and Greece, or summing it more strictly under one word, the\r\nGrecian peninsula, between the Danube and the Morea, a most minutely\r\ndivided region of plateaus and mountain chains; in truth, the most\r\narticulated peninsula in the world, and embracing ¹⁄₁₅ of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Crimea, a rhomboidal peninsula, turned to the south—its northern\r\nhalf a flat steppe, its southern a high plateau—the only peninsula of\r\nsoutheastern Europe projecting into the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nEvery one of these peninsulas differs from every other in shape; every\r\none has a distinct individuality imposed upon it. Within the smallest\r\ncompass on earth, relatively speaking, there is found around Europe the\r\nvery largest variety in its articulations. The Grecian peninsula finds\r\nits only superior on the northwest of Europe, in the coast of insulated\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nBy means of this characteristic separation of so many more or less\r\nindividualized parts of the continent through the agency of arms of the\r\nsea, the coast-line of Europe has been prolonged to an extraordinary\r\nlength. The areas of the three continents of the Old World are as follows\r\nin round numbers: Europe, 3,500,000 square miles; Africa, 11,800,000\r\nsquare miles; and Asia, 19,300,000 square miles. Although the superficial\r\ncontents of Africa are three times that of Europe, the length of the\r\ncoast-line is so far from being equal, that that of Europe is much the\r\ngreater, being 25,400 miles. The Asiatic coast-line is about one-third\r\nlonger still, 32,900 miles; but, as the area of Asia is more than five\r\ntimes that of Europe, a great part of the Asiatic coast-line, that on the\r\nnorth, from Nova Zembla to Kamtchatka, must be considered as unimportant\r\nin relation to the development of the resources of Asia.\r\n\r\nEurope is, therefore, that continent of the Old World which has\r\nrelatively, and I might almost say absolutely, received the largest\r\ncoast-line of any, encompassing a distance of 25,400 miles. That is to\r\nsay, the coast-line of Europe, extended in a straight line, would pass\r\naround the globe and coincide with the equator. To this admirable feature\r\nmay be added its favorable relation in situation to the various oceanic\r\nand wind currents, and its magnificent supply of harbors, the result of\r\nits articulated coast, all of which have made Europe the mistress of\r\nthe seas. Within modern times, the island group of Great Britain and\r\nIreland, the richest in harbors, is to the continent what, in ancient\r\ntimes, the Greek peninsula was, with its wealth of inlets, which gave\r\nit the command of the Mediterranean. A rich gift this has been to the\r\nsmallest of the continents of the Old World, to equalize its condition\r\nwith others. The providential wisdom which “sets one thing over against\r\nanother,” is clearly manifest in this. Europe, though in the center of\r\nthe great continental land-mass, becomes the most maritime of all, the\r\nmost approachable of all; or, in other words, its countries and its\r\npeoples are the most closely connected with the sea of all in the Old\r\nWorld, because they stand in the most unbroken contact with it.\r\n\r\nThus we discover the characteristic type which was impressed on Europe\r\nfrom the very first. Its relation to the world could not be understood by\r\nthe ancients, as to them half of the earth lay in unbroken darkness. Only\r\nby experience, only by the advance of civilization, and by comparison\r\nwith all the other continents, could this insight be gained. Doubtless\r\nmany similar relations yet remain unknown and unsuspected, which will\r\nsome day come to the light. The earth, as a planet, is only a grain of\r\nseed-corn sown by the Creator, enriched with powers of unfolding to\r\ninfinite perfection in the unexplored future. What we now perceive are\r\nonly the elementary principles—our knowledge only a motley; but even this\r\nis not without its uses, and is worthy of patient mastery.\r\n\r\nEurope, so broken in its coast, and rifted far toward its center by arms\r\nof the sea, has been affected in all its civil and social history to a\r\nvery great extent. This is the first natural condition of its progress,\r\nthe true physical basis of the fact that, upon the most limited of\r\nthe continents, the greatest historical diversity has sprung up. It\r\nis not absolute size, but relative, which gives the pre-eminence; not\r\nthe raw material, the mere mass, but its articulation, its form, which\r\nhere, as everywhere, gives mind the mastery over matter. As in the\r\nanimal and vegetable world there is, amid all the diversity of forms,\r\na constant advance from a lower to a higher plane, manifesting itself\r\nin the complexity of the organs; so, in the so-called unorganized side\r\nof nature, we see the same characteristic as soon as we have grasped\r\nthe whole mutual system of adaptations. The most general study of the\r\ndifferences between the continents exhibits an analogous harmony and\r\ncorrelation. As the simple, broad-leaved, solid cactus, or bunch-trunked\r\neuphorbia, (peculiar to the dry sand steppes of America and Africa,)\r\nappear branchless and without foliage,—the lower and undeveloped forms\r\nof vegetation,—so, too, the regions to which they are indigenous are the\r\nunbroken plains of North America, or the plateaus of still less broken\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nThe broken coast-line of Asia and Europe is analogous to that higher\r\ndevelopment which we find in the palm and in the full, round crown\r\nof the European fruit-tree, which bears blossoms and fruit as far as\r\nthe very extremities of the branches. In the animal organization, the\r\narticulation of Europe is to be compared with the complex hand of man,\r\nso far superior to the prehensile organs of lower creatures, that Buffon\r\nsaw in that feature alone the manifestation of man’s place among the\r\nanimal kingdom.\r\n\r\nIf we look out over the earth, we see that the limbs of the continents,\r\nso to speak, the coasts, the peninsulas, and the adjacent islands,\r\nare the most favored places of all for civilization to find its true\r\nhome upon. With the degree of diversity in the structure of a country,\r\nthe value of its organisms advances. In this respect, Europe may be\r\nconsidered as the branches and foliage of a great tree, whose trunk and\r\nroot are to be traced to Central Asia, Africa being a stunted side-shoot.\r\nOr, to compare the continents to a still higher class of forms, Europe\r\nmay be called the Face of the Old World, out of which the soul of\r\nhumanity could look more clearly into the great and promising future.\r\n\r\nWe repeat it—it is not absolute size, it is not the mass nor the weight\r\nof the material, it is the form, in its greater complexity, which\r\ndetermines the fate of nations and decrees the advancement of man.\r\nThis gift, in its full measure, has been conferred on Europe. In its\r\ncomplex articulation lies still another characteristic of Europe in\r\ncontradistinction to the other continents.\r\n\r\nIf in Africa the coast offers no contrast to the interior, and both\r\nremain on the same low plane of development, Asia, on the contrary,\r\ndisplays a perfect antagonism between its central regions and its\r\nsea-board. The territory of the Mongolians, the Tartars, and Toorkomans\r\nhas always remained at the very lowest stage of civilization. The\r\nsea-board, on the other hand, has witnessed the growth of a number of\r\nisolated nations, who, without the help of mutual dependence, have\r\narrived at a considerably high degree of culture—the Chinese, Malays,\r\nHindoos, Persians, Arabians, Syrians, and Armenians. But their influence\r\ncould not penetrate to the compact interior, to transform its nature, nor\r\nmodify its nationalities. Individual progress in nations, however high it\r\nmay be carried, can never contribute much toward any real penetration of\r\nthe interior of so vast a region as Central Asia.\r\n\r\nEurope shows in its construction and the relations to which it gives rise\r\ncharacteristics exactly opposite. Being far less massive, the proportion\r\nof its extremities to the undeveloped interior is much less great than\r\nin Asia. From this, it results that the central part does not prove a\r\nhinderance to civilization, viewed physically, hydrographically, or\r\nhistorically; it nowhere serves as a barrier, but rather as a mediator,\r\nand a means of communication between the extremities. This has given\r\nEurope a character exactly opposite to that of Asia: its North and its\r\nSouth are united, its East and its West; they are not like antagonistic\r\npoles, but extend to each other friendly hands. In Africa, the greater\r\npart of the interior lies absolutely without contact with and relations\r\nto the coast. In Asia, there is a much larger portion of the interior\r\nequally without connection with the sea-board, and remaining up to this\r\nday in its primitive barbarism.\r\n\r\nSymmetry of form gains in Europe a clear advantage over mere mass.\r\nEurope, the smallest of the continents, was destined to gain precedence\r\nover all the rest, Asia included. As Asia, lying within all the zones,\r\ncolossal in size, and most plentifully enriched with the gifts of nature,\r\nwas fitted to be the nursery of supply for all other parts of the world\r\nwithout impoverishing itself; so Europe, limited in size and confined\r\nto the temperate zone, but most complex in its subdivision, having a\r\ngreat diversity in its ocean inlets, as well as in its hills, valleys,\r\nplateaus, and mountains, yet, without great extremes, has been especially\r\nfitted for the reception of stranger races, and for the development of\r\ntheir energies and the advance of their culture. The symmetry and harmony\r\nof Europe have constituted the true home of all varieties of national\r\ncharacter, and have adapted it to their mutual action, and to the\r\ntransfer of their distinctive character to one another.\r\n\r\nThroughout the entire center of Europe there is an intimate connection\r\nwith the sea-coast and with the extremities, with the least possible\r\ndisadvantages. This is accomplished by those sinuous river-courses\r\nwhose analogies are to be found nowhere in the adjacent continents. The\r\nvery broadest part of Russia even is intersected with large navigable\r\nrivers; and the west and center of Europe are not less richly supplied\r\nwith these lines of communication, whose starting-points lie often close\r\ntogether, as in the case of the Danube, the Rhine, the Po, and the Rhone.\r\nHow different is this from the hydrographical system of Central Asia,\r\nwhere the sources of the eastern rivers lie thousands of miles removed\r\nfrom those of the western rivers, and where the rivers of the north are\r\nseparated by almost as great distances from those of the south!\r\n\r\nTo what nature has given to Europe man has largely added, seeking by\r\nmeans of canals and railways to make the whole continent subject to him\r\nand auxiliary to his needs. In this way the interior districts have\r\nappropriated to themselves the advantages of the sea-coast, and the\r\ndistance which it has placed between itself and Asia and Africa has only\r\nbeen increased. Nature first gave Europe its vantage-ground, and man has\r\ngone on from that point and doubled the gifts of nature.\r\n\r\nGreat peninsulas stretch away into both the great inland seas of\r\nEurope—that of the North and that of the South; the Danish and\r\nScandinavian peninsulas into the complex, and yet, physically speaking,\r\nsingle body of water, embracing the North Sea, Baltic, and Gulf of\r\nBothnia; Spain, Italy, and the Grecian peninsula extending southward\r\ninto the Mediterranean. In the latter there is the greatest contrast\r\nbetween the deeply-indented northern shore and the bare, sandy coast of\r\nthe African side. In just as great contrast is the uniformly unbroken\r\nsea-line of northern Siberia, compared with the articulated shore of\r\nnorthern Russia. How entirely different would the development of northern\r\nAsia have been, if a Siberian inland sea had penetrated to the very foot\r\nof the Altai, as the seas of northern Europe have pierced to the center\r\nof the continent! And had the shallow Syrtis cleft northern Africa as far\r\nas Lake Tchad, as the Adriatic has done on the opposite coast, Central\r\nAfrica would not now be a terra incognita.\r\n\r\nThe northern as well as the southern extremities of Europe, so far as\r\nthey are projected into inland seas, have received an equal size and\r\nequal natural advantages, each of its own kind, so that, conditioned\r\nby its own peculiarities, its population have helped it to attain\r\nits rightful place, and an individuality independent of continental\r\ninfluences. The abundant resources which each of these extremities\r\nenjoys have insured it, in a physical as well as historical view, an\r\nindependence which has reacted favorably upon the whole continent. What\r\na debt does not Europe owe to the Greeks, Italians, Spaniards, Dutch,\r\nDanes, Scandinavians! How entirely different would the whole development\r\nof the shores of Europe have been, had they been bold, inaccessible\r\nrocks, an unbroken line of coast, like Uralaska, or the smaller Asiatic\r\npeninsulas of Kamtchatka and Malacca! And where would the accomplished\r\nEuropean stand to-day, in comparison with his black neighbor on the\r\nsouth, were it not for the articulated coast-line of the continent which\r\ngives him his home?\r\n\r\nAnd still there remains, out of the inexhaustible richness of nature, one\r\nleading feature to be taken into account. To estimate it properly, we\r\nmust pay attention briefly to the islands of the three continents of the\r\nOld World.\r\n\r\n\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nEurope, as a continent, is distinguished by its adjacent islands.\r\nFollowing the irregular coast-line of its many extremities, they lie\r\nalong, in greater or less number, the satellites, so to speak, of the\r\nmain land. They are scattered almost everywhere, yet not distant from\r\nthe coast, like Iceland, but within sight of the shore. In character\r\nthey resemble the adjacent coast, and form a true part of the main land,\r\nexcept in the one fact of separation. Strabo even called Sicily an\r\ninsular continuation of Italy, and discriminated between islands found\r\nin mid-ocean and those found near the coast, calling the former pelagic\r\nand the latter littoral islands. These he regarded as having been at\r\nsome previous period rent from the main land. The coast islands are by\r\nno means, like many of the pelagic islands, mere rocky groups, thrown\r\nup by volcanic convulsions, or small, desolate, barren ledges. They are\r\nvery diverse in character: some are fertile single islands, like Sicily,\r\nCandia, Bornholm, Rugen, Negropont; some are double islands, like Britain\r\nand Ireland, Zealand and Funen, Corsica and Sardinia; some are island\r\ngroups, like the 3 Balearic islands, the 3 Maltese islands, the 20 Ionian\r\nislands, the 67 Orkneys, the 90 Shetlands, the still more numerous\r\nHebrides, the Aland group, and that of the Grecian archipelago. They are\r\ngenerally of very large size, in comparison with the continent to which\r\nthey are adjacent; a characteristic not only very rare in islands, but\r\nwhich must exert great influence. They are to be viewed, therefore, as\r\ncontinuations of Europe, not as lands sundered from the main land; they\r\nare to be considered as its sea-ports, and the mediators between Europe\r\nand the other continents.\r\n\r\nIn round numbers, the islands of Europe embrace about 175,000 square\r\nmiles—a twentieth of the continent.\r\n\r\nThis amount of insular territory has given Europe a great diversity of\r\nrelations, and has contributed much to its ethnographical character.\r\nImagine only England and her whole group struck out of existence. What\r\nimpoverishment it would bring! The Danish peninsula, without the adjacent\r\nislands of Funen and Zealand, were a mere tongue of sand. Without Sicily\r\nto furnish grain, Rome’s history had been entirely different from what\r\nit was. What a change it would have made in the development of Italy\r\nand Greece, had the Cyclades and Crete not served as a bridge, over\r\nwhich the civilization of Hither Asia might pass! Yet these islands,\r\nwith their inhabitants, do not stand in necessary dependence on the\r\ncontiguous main land; they have often in themselves the conditions of\r\nindependent growth and prosperity. And yet the geological qualities and\r\ngeneral features of islands may agree very closely with those of the land\r\nhard by; as is the case with the British, Danish, Italian, and Grecian\r\ngroups. Southern England is a continuation of northern France, Picardy,\r\nand the Netherlands, as the geology of these districts shows. Sicily is a\r\ncontinuation of the volcanic soil of Calabria, and Candia of the Morea.\r\n\r\nHence the possibility, despite the separation of islands from the main\r\nland, of a close connection in the habits, manners, and culture of the\r\npeople, thus separated, depending as they do on a common soil, and having\r\nthe same industries in common. It would be entirely different in Great\r\nBritain, for example, if the south end of England were geologically\r\nformed like the north end of Scotland. Instead of harmony there would be\r\nrepulsion, and that mutual interchange of relations would not exist which\r\nhas so powerful an influence on the whole course of European history.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable number of islands on the coast of Europe, and their\r\nsignificance and value, formerly escaped attention; or rather their\r\ninfluence on the development of that continent, in comparison with\r\nothers, was not made a matter of study.\r\n\r\nAfrica has never enlarged its domain through the aid of adjacent\r\nislands. Poor as it is in all coast indentations, it is just as poor in\r\nislands. Only a few insignificant ones, which have no close geological\r\nconnection with the shore, are found here. The sporadic groups found\r\nin the Atlantic and Indian Oceans are almost exclusively the product\r\nof subterranean forces, and are entirely unlike the stratified lime\r\nand sandstone formations of the coast. There is, therefore, no close\r\nconnection between the inanimate nature of continent and islands and\r\ntheir respective populations; no physical conditions have imposed upon\r\nthem a common historical development. Only the Canary Islands, southwest\r\nof the Atlas Mountain range, and Madagascar, could be regarded as at\r\nall exceptional to this. But the nine Canaries are relatively extremely\r\nsmall, embracing but about 3000 square miles in all; much too small to\r\nexercise any important influence, or to harbor a large population.\r\nBesides, they are separated from the main land by marine currents, which\r\nwould prevent any very important reaction, however large the islands in\r\nthemselves might be. The Cape Verd islands, embracing only about 1750\r\nsquare miles, stand in yet more unfavorable relations to the main land.\r\nSo, too, the solitary islands of St. Helena and Ascension, and in the\r\nIndian Ocean the scattered groups of the Camara, Amirante, and Seychelle\r\nislands, embracing all together but 3300 square miles, and Socotra, about\r\n1750 square miles. Only Madagascar would be large enough to enrich the\r\ncontinent essentially, if it were nearer to the main land. But it is\r\nseparated from it by the broad and dangerous Mozambique Channel; both,\r\ntherefore, have remained without mutual relations; their populations are\r\nentirely unlike, and there has been no exchange of productions between\r\nthem. Madagascar is, therefore, only apparently, and by the apparent\r\ncontiguity of the mass, a neighbor of Africa; but, in reality, _i.e._ as\r\nit relates to the organic unity of all the various parts of the globe, it\r\nis far more intimately connected by the system of marine currents to the\r\nMalayan Archipelago, southeast of Asia, than to Africa.\r\n\r\nEntirely different is it with the island system of Asia. The eastern and\r\nsouthern sides are remarkably characterized by the profuse numbers of\r\nislands found there. It might be said, that what Africa lacks in this\r\nregard, Asia more than supplies. On the Asiatic coast they appear in such\r\nvast numbers that they have been called, in contrast with the Old and New\r\nWorlds, the Island World, or Polynesia. They appear under the most varied\r\nconditions—in long rows, in massive groups, and here and there singly.\r\nThey begin with the North Polar islands, and pass southward in unbroken\r\nsuccession past the equator as far as the tropic of Capricorn.\r\n\r\nThe Aliaska chain connects the northwest coast of America with\r\nKamtchatka; it comprises over 100 islands, and embraces about 7660 square\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThe Koorile island extends to the south as far as Saghalien and Yesso.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese chain runs southward as far as Cape Corea, and includes the\r\ngreat island of Niphon with numerous smaller ones, embracing an area of\r\n164,000 square miles.\r\n\r\nThen follow:—\r\n\r\nThe Loo-Choo islands as far as Formosa.\r\n\r\nThe single island of Formosa, 13,000 square miles.\r\n\r\nThe coast island of Hainan, 16,450 square miles.\r\n\r\nThe numerous group of the Philippines, with the adjacent islands, 121,000\r\nsquare miles.\r\n\r\nThe greater Sunda group, with its adjoining archipelago, 689,500 square\r\nmiles. Of these, Borneo embraces 295,600 square miles; Sumatra, 167,700\r\nsquare miles; Java, 54,600 square miles; and Celebes, 72,600 square miles.\r\n\r\nThe smaller Sunda group, 29,200 square miles.\r\n\r\nThe scattered group of the Moluccas, with the Banda and Ternate islands,\r\n7950 square miles.\r\n\r\nThe great island of New Guinea, 262,800 square miles, which forms the\r\ntransition of the Australian group.\r\n\r\nOn the south coast of Deccan, the great island of Ceylon, 25,860 square\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThese rows and groups of islands, embracing an aggregate of 1,095,000\r\nsquare miles, form a kind of insular isthmus from the southeastern\r\nextremity of Asia to the northwest of Australia, though broken by\r\nunnumbered straits. If lines be drawn from Sumatra and from Hainan to\r\nCape York, on the north coast of Australia, an ideal isthmus would be\r\nformed not unlike that which connects North and South America. If this\r\ninsular isthmus be further conceived to have been thrown up by volcanic\r\nforces, as that of Panama seems to have been, an addition of 1,095,000\r\nsquare miles has been made in this way to the most productive portions\r\nof the world. So great is the accession of territory that it has become\r\nthe abode of a distinct race—the Malay—which hardly finds a home at all\r\non the Asiatic shore. Asia has received very little advantage from this\r\nvast archipelago. Only the southeast coast has been affected by it; the\r\ncontinent, as a whole, has not been reached by its influence. On the\r\ncontrary, Australia has been largely affected by it in its productive\r\nand ethnographical character. Not only was it first discovered through\r\nthe agency of these islands, but it probably derives its population\r\nfrom them; it has received many of its animals and plants from them—the\r\nsugar-cane, the sago palm, the bread-fruit tree, the dog, and the swine.\r\n\r\nIn Polynesia, which, in point of size, far surpasses the Antilles\r\ngroup north of South America, we have the most dismembered region on\r\nthe surface of the globe. It is the highest degree of insulation,\r\nof individualization, and results from the extreme carrying out of\r\ndispersing causes. The space occupied by the greater Sunda group, with\r\nits five seas—the China, Java, Molucca, Celebes, and Mindoro—together\r\nwith the islands adjacent, the whole lying between longitude 110° and\r\n160° east and latitude 10° south and 20° north, a tract 3525 miles long\r\nand 2115 miles wide may worthily be compared with the area of Europe.\r\nSuch a mass of island groups and single isles, belonging not to Asia with\r\nany strict right, but in truth a maritime world of itself, having but the\r\nslightest connections with the adjacent continent, is not to be compared\r\nwith the island system of Europe, which is bound to the main land by the\r\nclosest ties.\r\n\r\nWere a similar insular dismemberment the universal principle on which the\r\nworld is constructed, and were there no continents whatever, there would\r\nbe an entire want of direct dependence in nations upon each other, and a\r\ndegree of independence which would be fatal to the best interests of man.\r\nEurope would be broken up into a number of great islands, like Borneo,\r\nand into countless islets. In the conformation of Europe, however,\r\nthere is the happiest system of compensations, and the most harmonious\r\nplay of contrasts to be found in the world. The disadvantages of a too\r\ngreat dividing up into islands, as in Polynesia, and of too compact and\r\nunrifted a central mass, as in Africa, are alike shunned. Both extremes\r\ncould not fail to be injurious to the best interests of the population.\r\nThe fullness and richness of nature might, perhaps, be increased; but the\r\neffects on human life could not fail to be bad. Man’s highest development\r\ndoes not consist with any extreme in the natural world: it is linked\r\nto the action and reaction of contrasts. In Polynesia, the district of\r\nextreme dismemberment, the Malays are the least homogeneous of any race\r\non the earth. Malays, Battahs, Dakkas, Horasuras, and Papuas are all\r\nengaged in destructive war on each other, and are among the most degraded\r\npeoples on the globe. In this region there is the greatest diversity\r\nin physical nature, but not in the essential characteristics of man.\r\nOne point of accord ought not to be passed by: there, where the forces\r\nof nature, maritime and volcanic, are on the greatest scale known, the\r\nwarlike passions of man are on a not less consuming scale. In Polynesia\r\nthere are the rankest vegetation, the most fervid heat, the most\r\ncostly spices, animals very large and rare; but man attains to no such\r\nsuperiority,—he degenerates in worth and takes a low place. Where the\r\nthree natural kingdoms attain their perfection, man seems to linger in\r\nthe rear.\r\n\r\nIn Africa, where there is perfect uniformity in nature, there is\r\nuniformity in man; and the negro stock, though prolific, gives no race\r\nof high development to the world. Both extremes are equally unfavorable\r\nto the advance of man; he must have, in order to expand and take the\r\nplace to which his possibilities lead him, a sphere of mutual conditions,\r\nto which a compact continent like Africa and Central Asia can lay no\r\nclaim, and at the same time be free from that extreme individualization\r\ncharacteristic of the islands of Polynesia.\r\n\r\nEurope lies between these extremes. Limited in area, diversified in\r\nsurface, and deeply indented in its coast-line, it has experienced all\r\nthe advantages which a continent needs for its development, and for that\r\nhistorical greatness which Europe has won for itself. Less striking in\r\nnatural scenery and comparatively poor in resources, its contrasts in\r\nrespect mainly to the action of its inland seas and rivers over the main\r\nland have conduced to the happiest results. It has become the school for\r\nthe Old and the New World, taking the vitality and the crude gifts of\r\nAsia and turning them into channels where they could issue in new forms\r\nfor the advancement and the humanizing of the race.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Results of the above Considerations briefly stated.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, from what has now been said, that, with an area three\r\ntimes less than that of Africa, Europe (including its adjacent islands)\r\nhas a coast-line twice as extended. Without the islands, it is 25,380\r\nmiles in length, or the circumference of the earth. The coast-line of\r\nAfrica extends 17,860 miles; that of Asia 32,900.\r\n\r\nThe exceedingly varying areas of the continents may now be passed in very\r\nspeedy review. Europe is but a fifth as large as Asia. It is somewhat\r\nmore than a quarter as large as Africa; it is almost of the same size\r\nwith Australia. In relation to America, it stands between Asia and\r\nAfrica; it makes about ¹⁄₁₅ of all the continents, and about ¹⁄₂₀ of all\r\nthe land surface of the globe; but it is not absolute size, but relative,\r\nwhich determines the importance of a continent; and this twentieth part\r\nof all the land on the globe has had paramount influence over all the\r\nrest within the past few centuries. The ethnographical character of\r\nits population has had great weight in securing this result, and other\r\nreasons will doubtless be more apparent in the future.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important features in the study of the relative\r\nimportance of the continents is the comparative relation of the main\r\ntrunk, articulation, and island system to each other. The following table\r\npresents this relation as it exists in the Old World:—\r\n\r\n    Africa: trunk 1, extremities 0, islands  ¹⁄₅₀\r\n    Asia:     ”   4,      ”      1,    ”     ⅛\r\n    Europe:   ”   2,      ”      1,    ”     ¹⁄₂₀\r\n\r\nThese are but approximations to the exact mathematical statement; but\r\nthey serve to indicate comprehensively this important fact. No exact\r\ncanon now exists for the perfect expression of the relations of the\r\ncontinents to each other, and their physical superiority and inferiority,\r\nand its lack is no less felt than it has been in art to express the\r\ncomparative importance of the organs of the human body in giving a\r\nrepresentation of man.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New World.\r\n\r\nAmerica is broken by the Caribbean Sea into a double continent, both\r\nparts being of colossal magnitude, although the southern portion is about\r\n2,000,000 square miles less in area than the northern. North America\r\ncontains 9,055,146 square miles. South America contains 7,073,875 square\r\nmiles; and both contain 16,129,021. The connecting link is found in the\r\ntapering isthmus of Central America, with its 302,443 square miles of\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nBut closely connected as is the northern part of the continent with\r\nthe southern, in a physical sense, in real connection, so far as man\r\nis concerned, they are widely separated. During the three centuries\r\nwhich have elapsed since the discovery of America, the Spanish and the\r\nAmericans have thought of breaking the connection—of sundering the\r\nisthmus. All communication between North and South America takes place\r\nby water, absolutely none by land. Even before the navigation of the\r\nhistorical period, there seems to have been no land road opened along the\r\nisthmus. The old race of the Caribs passed in boats from the Appalachian\r\nmountain land of North America to South America and the West Indies. The\r\nToltecs and Aztecs—the oldest tribes which wandered southward—seemed to\r\nhave ended their march on the high plateau of Mexico and the vale of\r\nAnahuac. The legends of the Incas give us no tidings of their traversing\r\nthe isthmus and reaching Peru on foot, and it is probable that they\r\nreached that land otherwise. The isthmus seems never to have been a\r\nbridge, but always a barrier. The great Antilles group of islands appears\r\nto have served far more as a means of communication between North and\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\nIn respect of contour, both divisions have an unmistakable analogy, which\r\nappears at first view. Both exhibit a triangular form, with the base at\r\nthe north and the apex at the south. Toward the south, too, rather than\r\ntoward the west, speaking in general terms, the gradual conquests of\r\nman advance, and therefore there cannot be in the New World, as in the\r\nOld, a striking contrast between the Orient and the Occident. East and\r\nwest, in the New World, are less dependent on each other; they have more\r\nindividuality, but with a great preponderance of importance in the east\r\nover the west side, by reason of the more favorable situation in relation\r\nto the sea, less sharpness and boldness of physical features, and a more\r\nscanty population. The west side of America has by no means kept up with\r\nthe advance of its eastern side. Nor could the more southern shores\r\nof America compete with those on the northeast, and supply an analogy\r\nto the occident of the Old World; for North America stands related to\r\nEurope by ties of the closest nature, by wind systems, currents, a not\r\ndissimilar climate, and is far more nearly connected with it than with\r\nSouth America: nor could the latter derive any real advantage from its\r\nopposite neighbor, rude and undeveloped Africa; nor has the Caribbean\r\nSea performed any such service for America as the Mediterranean has for\r\nEurope, being twice as large in area and far more unfavorably situated to\r\nadvance the interests of civilization. It is only within a recent period\r\nthat the Caribbean has become a valuable auxiliary to the culture of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nSouth America is only a colossal right-angled triangle of land, with very\r\nlittle articulation in its shores. The northwest and the eastern angles\r\nare sharply defined, and the southern one is very acute, the continent\r\nrunning out in the shape of a thin wedge. With some modifications, it\r\nhas the same form with its neighbor Africa, and is just as unvarying\r\nin its want of a serrated coast, its sea-line being but 16,000 miles\r\nin length, almost the same as that of Africa. Like Africa, too, South\r\nAmerica is destitute of peninsulas and adjacent islands; its coast is as\r\nunindented as that of Africa and Australia, all three of these continents\r\nof the southern hemisphere being in strict conformity. Yet South America\r\nis capable of great progress: its conditions are very plastic; it is\r\ncharacterized by the size and number of the great rivers which pass\r\nthrough its very center; its flora and fauna are extremely rich. In\r\nthe fruitfulness of its soil, its division by mountains, and its water\r\nsystem, it holds great pre-eminence over Africa. An effort to connect its\r\ngreat rivers, and thus to make its immense natural advantages of mutual\r\nservice, seems to promise a far more prosperous future for South America\r\nthan can be predicted for Central Africa; yet the native population of\r\nthe country stand on a very low plane of manhood.\r\n\r\nThe wedge-shaped plateau of Patagonia is not at all benefited, as\r\nprevious analysis would lead us to expect, by its long coast and by\r\nthe nearness of the islands of Terra del Fuego. The fruitful island\r\nof Tasmania is far more valuable to Australia than is this island to\r\nPatagonia, and even Iceland is a more productive neighbor to Norway. The\r\nTerra del Fuego group, embracing a territory of 29,000 square miles,\r\nalthough hard by the South American coast, only injures it instead\r\nof blessing it, for it imperils shipping and harbors a population\r\nso degraded that they have no wants which can stimulate the rudest\r\ncivilization. With a precipitous, craggy coast, without trees and without\r\ngrass, covered only with moss, and belonging strictly to the polar\r\nworld, it must give a habitation to the very lowest and most degraded of\r\nthe human race, isolated from the world, and only casually visited when\r\nwinds and storms throw mariners upon its shores.\r\n\r\nNot every island is to be considered, therefore, as a gain to the\r\nadjacent main land. If Terra del Fuego lay at the mouth of the La Plata\r\nRiver, it would have become a valuable auxiliary to Brazil. The worth of\r\nan island is relative, not absolute.\r\n\r\nThe Antilles group is the great insular formation contiguous to\r\nCentral America. Its area, though comprising 94,700 square miles, is\r\nnot one-tenth as great as that of the great Sunda group. By situation\r\nand physical conditions, it is much more closely connected with North\r\nthan with South America. The Caribbean Sea is twice as large as the\r\nMediterranean, the one having 801,800 square miles, and the other\r\n1,675,800 square miles. It has been, therefore, more difficult to make\r\nthe larger tributary to the advance of civilization than the smaller.\r\n\r\nNorth America has entirely taken the palm from South America in the\r\nprogress of its culture, just as has uniformly been the case with all the\r\ncontinents of the northern hemisphere compared with the southern; and yet\r\nthe tropical southern continent is far more profusely endowed with the\r\ngifts of nature than the temperate northern one. The northern half, on\r\nthe other hand, enjoys a far greater advantage in its broken coast-line,\r\nnumerous bays, gulfs, islands, peninsulas, harbors, as well as by reason\r\nof its greater want of conformity to a rigid triangular form.\r\n\r\nEnlarging, as it does, toward its southern extremity, North America\r\napproaches a trapezoidal shape, like Asia, and, as in Asia also, the size\r\nof the main body preponderates greatly over that of the extremities.\r\nSeveral of these extremities, too, extend toward the east and south, and\r\nonly a few toward the west. To the North American peninsulas and islands\r\nbelong the northeasterly island group of Greenland, (which for centuries\r\nwas considered to be a peninsula, but which, since Parry’s discoveries in\r\n1820, has been known to be a group of independent islands,) Bank’s Land,\r\nBoothia Felix, Cockburn, Melville’s Peninsula, Labrador, New Brunswick,\r\nNova Scotia, and Florida, the latter 59,000 square miles in area.\r\n\r\nThe northeast of North America is everywhere much cut up by inlets of the\r\nocean, larger bays, gulfs, and sounds. This is the main characteristic\r\nof the shore of the northern United States and Canada. As all these open\r\ntoward Europe, the situation of this whole region has been especially\r\nadapted to the most speedy advance in civilization. The pride of the\r\nAmerican can no more plume itself on an independent progress than can\r\nthat of the European; to the former, Europe is the Orient from which he\r\nreceives, in an already advanced stage, what the European receives from\r\nAsia, his own Orient.\r\n\r\nThe less important peninsulas of North America, and the side most\r\ndestitute of them, are turned toward the northern Pacific. To this region\r\nbelong the Russian possessions, the desolate wastes of Aliaska, and,\r\nfarther to the south, the peninsula of Old California, which has begun,\r\nwithin the last ten years, to play an active part in the world’s affairs.\r\nBut all three of these are capable at present of little independent\r\nadvance. They must wait till they feel the impulse of the civilization\r\nof the older American States, before they take that place to which the\r\nnewly-organized commercial relations with China and Japan seem to be\r\nleading the way.\r\n\r\nNorth America enjoys a great advantage over Europe in the possession\r\nof large inland lakes or seas. The prevalence of articulation and of\r\nthe adjacent islands is not toward the south, but toward the polar and\r\nsub-polar regions, (from 40° to 50° N. lat.,) as in Europe. And although\r\nmany of these islands and peninsulas are as yet but little known, still\r\nthe progress of discovery has been so rapid within the past few years,\r\nthat it would seem, by European analogies, that an important history\r\nis yet in store for them. For there is a great kinship between these\r\nnorthern regions of America and the Scandinavian and North Russian\r\ndomains of Europe. And we know well that no degree of cold has ever\r\nintimidated civilization from penetrating in the latter to the very\r\nconfines of the polar world.\r\n\r\nAs the White Sea, (48,500 square miles in area,) the Baltic, (167,000\r\nsquare miles,) and the yet greater North Sea, have broken through the\r\nnorthern regions of Europe, so on a far more gigantic scale have the\r\ninroads of the ocean rifted and sundered North America. This we have\r\nlearned in our recent frequent voyages to the Esquimaux regions. Baffin’s\r\nBay, Lancaster Sound, Smith’s Sound, Jones’ Sound, Barrow Strait, Fox’s\r\nChannel with its uncounted islands, Hudson’s Bay with its 499,000 square\r\nmiles of surface, Boothia Gulf, Victoria and Georgia Seas, Wellington’s\r\nChannel, Melville Sound, Prince of Wales Straits, and very many other\r\nwater passages and basins divide those northern districts into a vast\r\nmesh of islands and peninsulas. The superficial area of all these tracts\r\nis on a colossal scale; even the Greenland group is estimated to include\r\n766,500 square miles. Within the past few years this whole Arctic Sea has\r\nbeen the scene of numerous expeditions of discovery, some of them on a\r\nprincely scale.\r\n\r\nAll this shows that North America is fashioned much more after the\r\nanalogy of Europe than of South America. The analogy would be much more\r\nclose, if North America were as favorably affected by climatic conditions\r\nas Europe. Both continents are washed at the south as well as at the\r\nnorth by great inland seas, and divided up by them in a manner peculiar\r\nto them among all the continents. Of this articulation, America, less\r\nfavored by climate, has much the larger share. By its admirable harbors,\r\nand by the action of the Gulf Stream crossing the Atlantic in two\r\ndirections, America has been specially fitted to receive the population\r\nand civilization of the Old World, and to stand in the closest relations\r\nwith it. In this, united with the arrangement of its mountain chains\r\nand the happy characteristics of its river systems, America bears the\r\npalm completely away from Asia. In that continent the colossal rivers\r\nof the north have no connection at their sources with the head-waters\r\nof the great Chinese, Indian, and West Asiatic rivers. It is entirely\r\ndifferent in North America, where the St. Lawrence, Mackenzie, Columbia,\r\nColorado, Mississippi, and Missouri flow from the same region, as from a\r\ncommon center, not separated at their sources by an immense plateau, but\r\nforming a single river system, from the mouth of one to that of another,\r\nflowing in just the contrary direction. We find, therefore, that there,\r\nas in North Europe, civilization has followed the water-courses, and has\r\nplanted colonies as far north as 70° on the coast of Greenland; while in\r\nAsia human habitations cease with 65° N. lat.\r\n\r\nAmerica seems to be appointed, by its physical conditions, to plant the\r\nbanner of human progress at the most northern parts of the globe, and to\r\ndo for the northern hemisphere what Great Britain, through her colonies\r\nin Tasmania and South Australia, with their admirable harbors, is doing\r\nfor the southern.\r\n\r\nNorthern Asia seems to have no future indicated for her beyond the\r\nsources and upper courses of her great rivers; she seems to depend upon\r\nCentral Asia and upon Russian Europe for all the scanty culture which\r\nshe may possess. In its south and east it seems to have within its\r\nChinese and Indian populations the seeds of an independent development,\r\nwhose results, like those of Arabia, have been transferred to Europe to\r\nbecome improved there, and then to be given to the world. The form of the\r\nthree great peninsulas, which were the home of Asiatic culture, has been\r\nrepeated in Europe,—but with how great a difference! The three European\r\npeninsulas are not in the tropical zone and near the equator, but are\r\n1400 miles farther north. The two groups—the eastern one in South Asia,\r\nthe western one in South Europe—each consisting of three peninsulas, are\r\nthe most valuable auxiliaries the world’s civilization ever had. Through\r\ntheir agency Asia in the torrid zone and Europe in the temperate have\r\nbecome what America and Australia are yet to be to the extreme north\r\nand the extreme south. The former were for the past, the latter for the\r\npresent and the future. South America, and yet much more Africa and\r\nAustralia, seem to be held in reserve for the need of a home where the\r\ncivilization of centuries yet to come shall expand into perfection. They\r\nnow are in their infancy; the day only begins to break in them. Furnished\r\nas they have been with the most liberal gifts of nature, they must\r\nreceive a culture of which we as yet have little conception. In what way\r\nthis can be done, the history of the past reveals. The art of navigation\r\nhas, within the past three centuries, given to islands and to continents\r\na new life, and developed relations unknown till then. The very touch of\r\nEuropean civilization has already wakened the world to new life; and the\r\noceans, which were once the most impassable of barriers, have become the\r\nclosest of bonds to draw the earth together, and to further its progress\r\ntoward the consummation of all history.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Prof. D. C. Gilman, of Yale College.\r\n\r\n[2] Meteors, which are nightly visible, are different from the periodic\r\nphenomena, seen in August and November, in different localities over the\r\nearth, and called falling stars. These exist outside of our atmosphere,\r\nand belong not to the earth, but rather to the great solar system.\r\n\r\n[3] The English does not convey adequately, certainly as idiomatic\r\nEnglish, the fullness of the German classes, Berge, Vorberge,\r\nHochgeberge, Alpen, and Riesenberge.\r\n\r\n[4] Not inappropriately has geology been called the Anatomy of mountain\r\nranges. The more mountains are studied geologically, the more safe become\r\nthe conclusions that are drawn from them. The smaller and more scattered\r\nridges of central Europe have become the chief quarries for geological\r\ndiscovery, because of the rich variety which they afford to the student,\r\nand also because of their accessibility.\r\n\r\n[5] In exact correspondence with the historic progress of upheaval is the\r\ninternal and external aspect of the result. In direct connection with the\r\nextent, course, grandeur, succession of oceanic and volcanic forces, and\r\nin constructing new geological formations, is the inexhaustible variety\r\nof structure, in respect to continuity, degrees of fracture, as well as\r\nthe more or less rich prodigality of mineral treasure brought to light.\r\nThe later formations—the masses injected to fill up huge chasms opened by\r\nvolcanic pressure from below—are easily distinguished from the primitive\r\nformation. These courses are usually the depositories of minerals, which\r\nthe great internal heat has apparently sublimated and crystallised,\r\ngiving us our gold-sand, rock-salt, and the precious metals.\r\n\r\n[6] See Fr.
