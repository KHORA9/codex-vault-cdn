In each map of this plate the\r\ncentral point represents the point vertically over the observer's head,\r\nand the circumference represents his horizon. The plan of each map is\r\nsuch that the direction of a star or constellation, as respects the\r\ncompass-points, and its elevation, also, above the horizon, at the given\r\nseason, can be at once determined. Two illustrations of the use of the\r\nmaps will serve to explain their nature better than any detailed\r\ndescription. Suppose first, that--at one of the hours named under Map\r\nI.--the observer wishes to find Castor and Pollux:--Turning to Map I. he\r\nsees that these stars lie in the lower left-hand quadrant, and very\r\nnearly towards the point marked S.E.; that is, they are to be looked for\r\non the sky towards the south-east. Also, it is seen that the two stars\r\nlie about one-fourth of the way from the centre towards the\r\ncircumference. Hence, on the sky, the stars will be found about\r\none-fourth of the way from the zenith towards the horizon: Castor will\r\nbe seen immediately above Pollux. Next, suppose that at one of the hours\r\nnamed the observer wishes to learn what stars are visible towards the\r\nwest and north-west:--Turning the map until the portion of the\r\ncircumference marked W ... N.W. is lowermost, he sees that in the\r\ndirection named the square of Pegasus lies not very high above the\r\nhorizon, one diagonal of the square being vertical, the other nearly\r\nhorizontal. Above the square is Andromeda, to the right of which lies\r\nCassiopeia, the stars [beta] and [epsilon] of this constellation lying\r\ndirectly towards the north-west, while the star [alpha] lies almost\r\nexactly midway between the zenith and the horizon. Above Andromeda, a\r\nlittle towards the left, lies Perseus, Algol being almost exactly\r\ntowards the west and one-third of the way from the zenith towards the\r\nhorizon (because one-third of the way from the centre towards the\r\ncircumference of the map). Almost exactly in the zenith is the star\r\n[delta] Aurigæ.\r\n\r\nThe four maps are miniatures of Maps I., IV., VII., and X. of my\r\n'Constellation Seasons,' fourth-magnitude stars, however, being omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATES II., III., IV., and V., illustrating Chapters II., III., IV., and V.\r\n\r\nPlates II. and IV. contain four star-maps. They not only serve to\r\nindicate the configuration of certain important star-groups, but they\r\nillustrate the construction of maps, such as the observer should make\r\nfor himself when he wishes to obtain an accurate knowledge of particular\r\nregions of the sky. They are all made to one scale, and on the conical\r\nprojection--the simplest and best of all projections for maps of this\r\nsort. The way in which the meridians and parallels for this projection\r\nare laid down is described in my 'Handbook of the Stars.' With a little\r\npractice a few minutes will suffice for sweeping out the equidistant\r\ncircular arcs which mark the parallels and ruling in the straight\r\nmeridians.\r\n\r\nThe dotted line across three of the maps represents a portion of the\r\nhorizontal circle midway between the zenith and the horizon at the hour\r\nat which the map is supposed to be used. At other hours, of course, this\r\nline would be differently situated.\r\n\r\nPlates III. and V. represent fifty-two of the objects mentioned in the\r\nabove-named chapters. As reference is made to these figures in the text,\r\nlittle comment is here required. It is to be remarked, however, that the\r\ncircles, and especially the small circles, do not represent the whole\r\nof the telescope's field of view, only a small portion of it. The object\r\nof these figures is to enable the observer to know what to expect when\r\nhe turns his telescope towards a difficult double star. Many of the\r\nobjects depicted are very easy doubles: these are given as objects of\r\nreference. The observer having seen the correspondence between an easy\r\ndouble and its picture, as respects the relation between the line\r\njoining the components and the apparent path of the double across the\r\ntelescope's field of view, will know how to interpret the picture of a\r\ndifficult double in this respect. And as all the small figures are drawn\r\nto one scale, he will also know how far apart he may expect to find the\r\ncomponents of a difficult double. Thus he will have an exact conception\r\nof the sort of duplicity he is to look for, and this is--_crede\r\nexperto_--a great step towards the detection of the star's duplicity.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATES VI. and VII., illustrating Chapters VI. and VII.\r\n\r\nThe views of Mercury, Venus, and Mars in these plates (except the\r\nsmaller view of Jupiter in Plate VII.) are supposed to be seen with the\r\nsame \"power.\"\r\n\r\nThe observer must not expect to see the details presented in the views\r\nof Mars with anything like the distinctness I have here given to them.\r\nIf he place the plate at a distance of six or seven yards he will see\r\nthe views more nearly as Mars is likely to appear in a good three-inch\r\naperture.\r\n\r\nThe chart of Mars is a reduction of one I have constructed from views by\r\nMr. Dawes. I believe that nearly all the features included in the chart\r\nare permanent, though not always visible. I take this opportunity of\r\nnoting that the eighteen orthographic pictures of Mars presented with my\r\nshilling chart are to be looked on rather as maps than as representing\r\ntelescopic views. They illustrate usefully the varying presentation of\r\nMars towards the earth. The observer can obtain other such illustrations\r\nfor himself by filling in outlines, traced from those given at the foot\r\nof Plate VI., with details from the chart. It is to be noted that Mars\r\nvaries in presentation, not only as respects the greater or less opening\r\nout of his equator towards the north or south, but as respects the\r\napparent slope of his polar axis to the right or left. The four\r\nprojections as shown, or inverted, or seen from the back of the plate\r\n(held up to the light) give presentations of Mars towards the sun at\r\ntwelve periods of the Martial year,--viz., at the autumnal and vernal\r\nequinoxes, at the two solstices, and at intermediate periods\r\ncorresponding to our terrestrial months.\r\n\r\nIn fact, by means of these projections one might readily form a series\r\nof sun-views of Mars resembling my 'Sun-views of the Earth.'\r\n\r\nIn the first view of Jupiter it is to be remarked that the three\r\nsatellites outside the disc are supposed to be moving in directions\r\nappreciably parallel to the belts on the disc--the upper satellites from\r\nright to left, the lower one from left to right. In general the\r\nsatellites, when so near to the disc, are not seen in a straight line,\r\nas the three shown in the figure happen to be. Of the three spots on the\r\ndisc, the faintest is a satellite, the neighbouring dark spot its\r\nshadow, the other dark spot the shadow of the satellite close to the\r\nplanet's disc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHALF-HOURS WITH THE TELESCOPE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nA HALF-HOUR ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE TELESCOPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few instruments which yield more pleasure and instruction than\r\nthe Telescope. Even a small telescope--only an inch and a half or two\r\ninches, perhaps, in aperture--will serve to supply profitable amusement\r\nto those who know how to apply its powers. I have often seen with\r\npleasure the surprise with which the performance even of an opera-glass,\r\nwell steadied, and directed towards certain parts of the heavens, has\r\nbeen witnessed by those who have supposed that nothing but an expensive\r\nand colossal telescope could afford any views of interest. But a\r\nwell-constructed achromatic of two or three inches in aperture will not\r\nmerely supply amusement and instruction,--it may be made to do useful\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe student of astronomy is often deterred from telescopic observation\r\nby the thought that in a field wherein so many have laboured, with\r\nabilities and means perhaps far surpassing those he may possess, he is\r\nlittle likely to reap results of any utility. He argues that, since the\r\nplanets, stars, and nebulæ have been scanned by Herschel and Rosse, with\r\ntheir gigantic mirrors, and at Pulkova and Greenwich with refractors\r\nwhose construction has taxed to the utmost the ingenuity of the\r\noptician and mechanic, it must be utterly useless for an unpractised\r\nobserver to direct a telescope of moderate power to the examination of\r\nthese objects.\r\n\r\nNow, passing over the consideration that a small telescope may afford\r\nits possessor much pleasure of an intellectual and elevated character,\r\neven if he is never able by its means to effect original discoveries,\r\ntwo arguments may be urged in favour of independent telescopic\r\nobservation. In the first place, the student who wishes to appreciate\r\nthe facts and theories of astronomy should familiarize himself with the\r\nnature of that instrument to which astronomers have been most largely\r\nindebted. In the second place, some of the most important discoveries in\r\nastronomy have been effected by means of telescopes of moderate power\r\nused skilfully and systematically. One instance may suffice to show what\r\ncan be done in this way. The well-known telescopist Goldschmidt (who\r\ncommenced astronomical observation at the age of forty-eight, in 1850)\r\nadded fourteen asteroids to the solar system, not to speak of important\r\ndiscoveries of nebulæ and variable stars, by means of a telescope only\r\nfive feet in focal length, mounted on a movable tripod stand.\r\n\r\nThe feeling experienced by those who look through a telescope for the\r\nfirst time,--especially if it is directed upon a planet or nebula--is\r\ncommonly one of disappointment. They have been told that such and such\r\npowers will exhibit Jupiter's belts, Saturn's rings, and the\r\ncontinent-outlines on Mars; yet, though perhaps a higher power is\r\napplied, they fail to detect these appearances, and can hardly believe\r\nthat they are perfectly distinct to the practised eye.\r\n\r\nThe expectations of the beginner are especially liable to\r\ndisappointment in one particular. He forms an estimate of the view he is\r\nto obtain of a planet by multiplying the apparent diameter of the planet\r\nby the magnifying power of his telescope, and comparing the result with\r\nthe apparent diameter of the sun or moon. Let us suppose, for instance,\r\nthat on the day of observation Jupiter's apparent diameter is 45\", and\r\nthat the telescopic power applied is 40, then in the telescope Jupiter\r\nshould appear to have a diameter of 1800\", or half a degree, which is\r\nabout the same as the moon's apparent diameter. But when the observer\r\nlooks through the telescope he obtains a view--interesting, indeed, and\r\ninstructive--but very different from what the above calculation would\r\nlead him to expect. He sees a disc apparently much smaller than the\r\nmoon's, and not nearly so well-defined in outline; in a line with the\r\ndisc's centre there appear three or four minute dots of light, the\r\nsatellites of the planet; and, perhaps, if the weather is favourable and\r\nthe observer watchful, he will be able to detect faint traces of belts\r\nacross the planet's disc.\r\n\r\nYet in such a case the telescope is not in fault. The planet really\r\nappears of the estimated size. In fact, it is often possible to prove\r\nthis in a very simple manner. If the observer wait until the planet and\r\nthe moon are pretty near together, he will find that it is possible to\r\nview the planet with one eye through the telescope and the moon with the\r\nunaided eye, in such a manner that the two discs may coincide, and thus\r\ntheir relative apparent dimensions be at once recognised. Nor should the\r\nindistinctness and incompleteness of the view be attributed to\r\nimperfection of the telescope; they are partly due to the nature of the\r\nobservation and the low power employed, and partly to the inexperience\r\nof the beginner.\r\n\r\nIt is to such a beginner that the following pages are specially\r\naddressed, with the hope of affording him aid and encouragement in the\r\nuse of one of the most enchanting of scientific instruments,--an\r\ninstrument that has created for astronomers a new sense, so to speak, by\r\nwhich, in the words of the ancient poet:\r\n\r\n    Subjecere oculis distantia sidera nostris,\r\n      Ætheraque ingenio supposuere suo.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is necessary that the beginner should rightly\r\nknow what is the nature of the instrument he is to use. And this is the\r\nmore necessary because, while it is perfectly easy to obtain such\r\nknowledge without any profound acquaintance with the science of optics,\r\nyet in many popular works on this subject the really important points\r\nare omitted, and even in scientific works such points are too often left\r\nto be gathered from a formula. When the observer has learnt what it is\r\nthat his instrument is actually to do for him, he will know how to\r\nestimate its performance, and how to vary the application of its\r\npowers--whether illuminating or magnifying--according to the nature of\r\nthe object to be observed.\r\n\r\nLet us consider what it is that limits the range of _natural_ vision\r\napplied to distant objects. What causes an object to become invisible as\r\nits distance increases? Two things are necessary that an object should\r\nbe visible. It must be _large_ enough to be appreciated by the eye, and\r\nit must _send light_ enough. Thus increase of distance may render an\r\nobject invisible, either through diminution of its apparent size, or\r\nthrough diminution in the quantity of light it sends to the eye, or\r\nthrough both these causes combined. A telescope, therefore, or (as its\r\nname implies) an instrument to render distant objects visible, must be\r\nboth a magnifying and an illuminating instrument.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 1._]\r\n\r\nLet EF, fig. 1, be an object, not near to AB as in the figure, but so\r\nfar off that the bounding lines from A and B would meet at the point\r\ncorresponding to the point P. Then if a large convex glass AB (called an\r\n_object-glass_) be interposed between the object and the eye, all those\r\nrays which, proceeding from P, fall on AB, will be caused to converge\r\nnearly to a point _p_. The same is true for every point of the object\r\nEMF, and thus a small image, _emf_, will be formed. This image will not\r\nlie exactly on a flat surface, but will be curved about the point midway\r\nbetween A and B as a centre. Now if the lens AB is removed, and an eye\r\nis placed at _m_ to view the distant object EMF, those rays only from\r\neach point of the object which fall on the pupil of the eye (whose\r\ndiameter is about equal to _mp_ suppose) will serve to render the object\r\nvisible. On the other hand, every point of the image _emf_ has received\r\nthe whole of the light gathered up by the large glass AB. If then we can\r\nonly make this light _available_, it is clear that we shall have\r\nacquired a large increase of _light_ from the distant object. Now it\r\nwill be noticed that the light which has converged to _p_, diverges from\r\n_p_ so that an eye, placed that this diverging pencil of rays may fall\r\nupon it, would be too small to receive the whole of the pencil. Or, if\r\nit did receive the whole of this pencil, it clearly could not receive\r\nthe whole of the pencils proceeding from other parts of the image _emf_.\r\n_Something_ would be gained, though, even in this case, since it is\r\nclear that an eye thus placed at a distance of ten inches from _emf_\r\n(which is about the average distance of distinct vision) would not only\r\nreceive much more light from the image _emf_, than it would from the\r\nobject EMF, but see the image much larger than the object. It is in this\r\nway that a simple object-glass forms a telescope, a circumstance we\r\nshall presently have to notice more at length. But we want to gain the\r\nfull benefit of the light which has been gathered up for us by our\r\nobject-glass. We therefore interpose a small convex glass _ab_ (called\r\nan eye-glass) between the image and the eye, at such a distance from the\r\nimage that the divergent pencil of rays is converted into a pencil of\r\nparallel or nearly parallel rays. Call this an emergent pencil. Then all\r\nthe emergent pencils now converge to a point on the axial line _m_M\r\n(produced beyond _m_), and an eye suitably placed can take in all of\r\nthem at once. Thus the whole, or a large part, of the image is seen at\r\nonce. But the image is seen inverted as shown. This is the Telescope, as\r\nit was first discovered, and such an arrangement would now be called a\r\n_simple astronomical Telescope_.\r\n\r\nLet us clearly understand what each part of the astronomical telescope\r\ndoes for us:--\r\n\r\nThe object-glass AB gives us an illuminated image, the amount of\r\nillumination depending on the size of the object-glass. The eye-glass\r\nenables us to examine the image microscopically.\r\n\r\nWe may apply eye-glasses of different focal length. It is clear that the\r\nshorter the focal length of _ab_, the nearer must _ab_ be placed to the\r\nimage, and the smaller will the emergent pencils be, but the greater the\r\nmagnifying power of the eye-glass. If the emergent pencils are severally\r\nlarger than the pupil of the eye, light is wasted at the expense of\r\nmagnifying power. Therefore the eye-glass should never be of greater\r\nfocal length than that which makes the emergent pencils about equal in\r\ndiameter to the pupil of the eye. On the other hand, the eye-glass must\r\nnot be of such small focal length that the image appears indistinct and\r\ncontorted, or dull for want of light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 2._]\r\n\r\nLet us compare with the arrangement exhibited in fig. 1 that adopted by\r\nGalileo. Surprise is sometimes expressed that this instrument, which in\r\nthe hands of the great Florentine astronomer effected so much, should\r\nnow be known as the _non-astronomical Telescope_. I think this will be\r\nreadily understood when we compare the two arrangements.\r\n\r\nIn the Galilean Telescope a small concave eye-glass, _ab_ (fig. 2), is\r\nplaced between the object-glass and the image. In fact, no image is\r\nallowed to be formed in this arrangement, but the convergent pencils are\r\nintercepted by the concave eye-glass, and converted into parallel\r\nemergent pencils. Now in fig. 2 the concave eye-glass is so placed as to\r\nreceive only a part of the convergent pencil A _p_ B, and this is the\r\narrangement usually adopted. By using a concave glass of shorter focus,\r\nwhich would therefore be placed nearer to _m p_, the whole of the\r\nconvergent pencil might be received in this as in the former case. But\r\nthen the axis of the emergent pencil, instead of returning (as we see it\r\nin fig. 1) _towards_ the axis of the telescope, would depart as much\r\n_from_ that axis. Thus there would be no point on the axis at which the\r\neye could be so placed as to receive emergent pencils showing any\r\nconsiderable part of the object. The difference may be compared to that\r\nbetween looking through the small end of a cone-shaped roll of paper and\r\nlooking through the large end; in the former case the eye sees at once\r\nall that is to be seen through the roll (supposed fixed in position), in\r\nthe latter the eye may be moved about so as to command the same range of\r\nview, but _at any instant_ sees over a much smaller range.\r\n\r\nTo return to the arrangement actually employed, which is illustrated by\r\nthe common opera-glass. We see that the full illuminating power of the\r\ntelescope is not brought into play. But this is not the only objection\r\nto the Galilean Telescope. It is obvious that if the part C D of the\r\nobject-glass were covered, the point P would not be visible, whereas, in\r\nthe astronomical arrangement no other effect is produced on the\r\nvisibility of an object, by covering part of the object-glass, than a\r\nsmall loss of illumination. In other words, the dimensions of the field\r\nof view of a Galilean Telescope depend on the size of the object-glass,\r\nwhereas in the astronomical Telescope the field of view is independent\r\nof the size of the object-glass. The difference may be readily tested.\r\nIf we direct an opera-glass upon any object, we shall find that any\r\ncovering placed over a part of the object-glass _becomes visible_ when\r\nwe look through the instrument, interfering therefore _pro tanto_ with\r\nthe range of view. A covering similarly placed on any part of the\r\nobject-glass of an astronomical telescope does not become visible when\r\nwe look through the instrument. The distinction has a very important\r\nbearing on the theory of telescopic vision.\r\n\r\nIn considering the application of the telescope to practical\r\nobservation, the circumstance that in the Galilean Telescope no real\r\nimage is formed, is yet more important. A real image admits of\r\nmeasurement, linear or angular, while to a _virtual_ image (such an\r\nimage, for instance, as is formed by a common looking-glass) no such\r\nprocess can be applied. In simple observation the only noticeable effect\r\nof this difference is that, whereas in the astronomical Telescope a\r\n_stop_ or diaphragm can be inserted in the tube so as to cut off what is\r\ncalled the _ragged edge_ of the field of view (which includes all the\r\npart not reached by _full pencils of light_ from the object-glass),\r\nthere is no means of remedying the corresponding defect in the Galilean\r\nTelescope. It would be a very annoying defect in a telescope intended\r\nfor astronomical observation, since in general the edge of the field of\r\nview is not perceptible at night. The unpleasant nature of the defect\r\nmay be seen by looking through an opera-glass, and noticing the gradual\r\nfading away of light round the circumference of the field of view.\r\n\r\nThe properties of reflection as well as of refraction have been enlisted\r\ninto the service of the astronomical observer. The formation of an image\r\nby means of a concave mirror is exhibited in fig. 3. As the observer's\r\nhead would be placed between the object and the mirror, if the image,\r\nformed as in fig. 3, were to be microscopically examined, various\r\ndevices are employed in the construction of reflecting telescopes to\r\navoid the loss of light which would result--a loss which would be\r\nimportant even with the largest mirrors yet constructed. Thus, in\r\nGregory's Telescope, a small mirror, having its concavity towards the\r\ngreat one, is placed in the axis of the tube and forms an image which is\r\nviewed through an aperture in the middle of the great mirror. A similar\r\nplan is adopted in Cassegrain's Telescope, a small convex mirror\r\nreplacing the concave one. In Newton's Telescope a small inclined-plane\r\nreflector is used, which sends the pencil of light off at right-angles\r\nto the axis of the tube. In Herschel's Telescope the great mirror is\r\ninclined so that the image is formed at a slight distance from the axis\r\nof the telescope. In the two first cases the object is viewed in the\r\nusual or direct way, the image being erect in Gregory's and inverted in\r\nCassegrain's. In the third the observer looks through the side of the\r\ntelescope, seeing an inverted image of the object. In the last the\r\nobserver sees the object inverted, but not altered as respects right and\r\nleft. The last-mentioned method of viewing objects is the only one in\r\nwhich the observer's back is turned towards the object, yet this method\r\nis called the _front view_--apparently _quasi lucus a non lucendo_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 3._]\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that in all astronomical Telescopes, reflecting or\r\nrefracting, a _real image_ of an object is submitted to microscopical\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nOf this fact the possessor of a telescope may easily assure himself;\r\nfor if the eye-glass be removed, and a small screen be placed at the\r\nfocus of the object-glass, there will appear upon the screen a small\r\npicture of any object towards which the tube is turned. But the image\r\nmay be viewed in another way which requires to be noticed. If the eye,\r\nplaced at a distance of five or six inches from the image, be directed\r\ndown the tube, the image will be seen as before; in fact, just as a\r\nsingle convex lens of short focus is the simplest microscope, so a\r\nsimple convex lens of long focus is the simplest telescope.[1] But a\r\nsingular circumstance will immediately attract the observer's notice. A\r\nreal picture, or the image formed on the screen as in the former case,\r\ncan be viewed at varying distances; but when we view the image directly,\r\nit will be found that for distinct vision the eye must be placed almost\r\nexactly at a fixed distance from the image. This peculiarity is more\r\nimportant than it might be thought at first sight. In fact, it is\r\nessential that the observer who would rightly apply the powers of his\r\ntelescope, or fairly test its performance, should understand in what\r\nrespect an image formed by an object-glass or object-mirror differs from\r\na real object.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarities to be noted are the _curvature_, _indistinctness_, and\r\n_false colouring_ of the image.\r\n\r\nThe curvature of the image is the least important of the three defects\r\nnamed--a fortunate circumstance, since this defect admits neither of\r\nremedy nor modification. The image of a distant object, instead of lying\r\nin a plane, that is, forming what is technically called a _flat field_,\r\nforms part of a spherical surface whose centre is at the centre of the\r\nobject-glass. Hence the centre of the field of view is somewhat nearer\r\nto the eye than are the outer parts of the field. The amount of\r\ncurvature clearly depends on the extent of the field of view, and\r\ntherefore is not great in powerful telescopes. Thus, if we suppose that\r\nthe angular extent of the field is about half a degree (a large or\r\nlow-power field), the centre is nearer than the boundary of the field by\r\nabout 1-320th part only of the field's diameter.\r\n\r\nThe indistinctness of the image is partly due to the obliquity of the\r\npencils which form parts of the image, and partly to what is termed\r\n_spherical aberration_. The first cause cannot be modified by the\r\noptician's skill, and is not important when the field of view is small.\r\nSpherical aberration causes those parts of a pencil which fall near the\r\nboundary of a convex lens to converge to a nearer (_i.e._ shorter) focus\r\nthan those which fall near the centre. This may be corrected by a proper\r\nselection of the forms of the two lenses which replace, in all modern\r\ntelescopes, the single lens hitherto considered.\r\n\r\nThe false colouring of the image is due to _chromatic aberration_. The\r\npencil of light proceeding from a point, converges, not to one point,\r\nbut to a short line of varying colour. Thus a series of coloured images\r\nis formed, at different distances from the object-glass. So that, if a\r\nscreen were placed to receive the mean image _in focus_, a coloured\r\nfringe due to the other images (_out of focus, and therefore too large_)\r\nwould surround the mean image.\r\n\r\nNewton supposed that it was impossible to get rid of this defect, and\r\ntherefore turned his attention to the construction of reflectors. But\r\nthe discovery that the _dispersive_ powers of different glasses are not\r\nproportional to their reflective powers, supplied opticians with the\r\nmeans of remedying the defect. Let us clearly understand what is the\r\ndiscovery referred to. If with a glass prism of a certain form we\r\nproduce a spectrum of the sun, this spectrum will be thrown a certain\r\ndistance away from the point on which the sun's rays would fall if not\r\ninterfered with. This distance depends on the _refractive_ power of the\r\nglass. The spectrum will have a certain length, depending on the\r\n_dispersive_ power of the glass. Now, if we change our prism for another\r\nof exactly the same shape, but made of a different kind of glass, we\r\nshall find the spectrum thrown to a different spot. If it appeared that\r\nthe length of the new spectrum was increased or diminished in exactly\r\nthe same proportion as its distance from the line of the sun's direct\r\nlight, it would have been hopeless to attempt to remedy chromatic\r\naberration. Newton took it for granted that this was so. But the\r\nexperiments of Hall and the Dollonds showed that there is no such strict\r\nproportionality between the dispersive and refractive powers of\r\ndifferent kinds of glass. It accordingly becomes possible to correct the\r\nchromatic aberration of one glass by superadding that of another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 4._]\r\n\r\nThis is effected by combining, as shown in fig. 4, a convex lens of\r\n_crown_ glass with a concave lens of _flint_ glass, the convex lens\r\nbeing placed nearest to the object. A little colour still remains, but\r\nnot enough to interfere seriously with the distinctness of the image.\r\n\r\nBut even if the image formed by the object-glass were perfect, yet this\r\nimage, viewed through a single convex lens of short focus placed as in\r\nfig. 1, would appear curved, indistinct, coloured, and also _distorted_,\r\nbecause viewed by pencils of light which do not pass through the centre\r\nof the eye-glass. These effects can be diminished (but not entirely\r\nremoved _together_) by using an _eye-piece_ consisting of two lenses\r\ninstead of a single eye-glass. The two forms of eye-piece most commonly\r\nemployed are exhibited in figs. 5 and 6. Fig. 5 is Huyghens' eye-piece,\r\ncalled also the _negative_ eye-piece, because a real image is formed\r\n_behind_ the _field-glass_ (the lens which lies nearest to the\r\nobject-glass). Fig. 6 represents Ramsden's eye-piece, called also the\r\n_positive_ eye-piece, because the real image formed by the object-glass\r\nlies _in front of_ the field-glass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 5._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 6._]\r\n\r\nThe course of a slightly oblique pencil through either eye-piece is\r\nexhibited in the figures. The lenses are usually plano-convex, the\r\nconvexities being turned towards the object-glass in the negative\r\neye-piece, and towards each other in the positive eye-piece. Coddington\r\nhas shown, however, that the best forms for the lenses of the negative\r\neye-piece are those shown in fig. 5.\r\n\r\nThe negative eye-piece, being achromatic, is commonly employed in all\r\nobservations requiring distinct vision only. But as it is clearly unfit\r\nfor observations requiring micrometrical measurement, or reference to\r\nfixed lines at the focus of the object-glass, the positive eye-piece is\r\nused for these purposes.\r\n\r\nFor observing objects at great elevations the diagonal eye-tube is\r\noften convenient. Its construction is shown in fig. 7. ABC is a totally\r\nreflecting prism of glass. The rays from the object-glass fall on the\r\nface AB, are totally reflected on the face BC, and emerge through the\r\nface AC. In using this eye-piece, it must be remembered that it\r\nlengthens the sliding eye-tube, which must therefore be thrust further\r\nin, or the object will not be seen in focus. There is an arrangement by\r\nwhich the change of direction is made to take place between the two\r\nglasses of the eye-piece. With this arrangement (known as the _diagonal\r\neye-piece_) no adjustment of the eye-tube is required. However, for\r\namateurs' telescopes the more convenient arrangement is the diagonal\r\neye-tube, since it enables the observer to apply any eye-piece he\r\nchooses, just as with the simple sliding eye-tube.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 7._]\r\n\r\nWe come next to the important question of the _mounting_ of our\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\nThe best known, and, in some respects, the simplest method of\r\nmounting a telescope for general observation is that known as the\r\n_altitude-and-azimuth_ mounting. In this method the telescope is\r\npointed towards an object by two motions,--one giving the tube the\r\nrequired _altitude_ (or elevation), the other giving it the required\r\n_azimuth_ (or direction as respects the compass points).\r\n\r\nFor small alt-azimuths the ordinary pillar-and-claw stand is\r\nsufficiently steady. For larger instruments other arrangements are\r\nneeded, both to give the telescope steadiness, and to supply slow\r\nmovements in altitude and azimuth. The student will find no difficulty\r\nin understanding the arrangement of sliding-tubes and rack-work commonly\r\nadopted. This arrangement seems to me to be in many respects defective,\r\nhowever. The slow movement in altitude is not uniform, but varies in\r\neffect according to the elevation of the object observed. It is also\r\nlimited in range; and quite a little series of operations has to be gone\r\nthrough when it is required to direct the telescope towards a new\r\nquarter of the heavens. However expert the observer may become by\r\npractice in effecting these operations, they necessarily take up some\r\ntime (performed as they must be in the dark, or by the light of a small\r\nlantern), and during this time it often happens that a favourable\r\nopportunity for observation is lost.\r\n\r\nThese disadvantages are obviated when the telescope is mounted in such a\r\nmanner as is exhibited in fig. 8, which represents a telescope of my own\r\nconstruction. The slow movement in altitude is given by rotating the rod\r\n_he_, the endless screw in which turns the small wheel at _b_, whose\r\naxle in turn bears a pinion-wheel working in the teeth of the quadrant\r\n_a_. The slow movement in azimuth is given in like manner by rotating\r\nthe rod _h'e'_, the lantern-wheel at the end of which turns a\r\ncrown-wheel on whose axle is a pinion-wheel working in the teeth of the\r\ncircle _c_. The casings at _e_ and _e'_, in which the rods _he_ and\r\n_h'e'_ respectively work, are so fastened by elastic cords that an\r\nupward pressure on the handle _h_, or a downward pressure on the handle\r\n_h'_, at once releases the endless screw or the crown-wheel\r\nrespectively, so that the telescope can be swept at once through any\r\ndesired angle in altitude or azimuth. This method of mounting has other\r\nadvantages; the handles are conveniently situated and constant in\r\nposition; also, as they do not work directly on the telescope, they can\r\nbe turned without setting the tube in vibration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 8._]\r\n\r\nI do not recommend the mounting to be exactly as shown in fig. 8. That\r\nmethod is much too expensive for an alt-azimuth. But a simple\r\narrangement of belted wheels in place of the toothed wheels _a_ and _c_\r\nmight very readily be prepared by the ingenious amateur telescopist; and\r\nI feel certain that the comfort and convenience of the arrangement would\r\namply repay him for the labour it would cost him. My own\r\ntelescope--though the large toothed-wheel and the quadrant were made\r\ninconveniently heavy (through a mistake of the workman who constructed\r\nthe instrument)--worked as easily and almost as conveniently as an\r\nequatorial.\r\n\r\nStill, it is well for the observer who wishes systematically to survey\r\nthe heavens--and who can afford the expense--to obtain a well-mounted\r\n_equatorial_. In this method of mounting, the main axis is directed to\r\nthe pole of the heavens; the other axis, at right angles to the first,\r\ncarries the telescope-tube. One of the many methods adopted for mounting\r\nequatorials is that exhibited--with the omission of some minor\r\ndetails--in fig. 9. _a_ is the polar axis, _b_ is the axis (called the\r\ndeclination axis) which bears the telescope. The circles _c_ and _d_\r\nserve to indicate, by means of verniers revolving with the axes, the\r\nmotion of the telescope in right ascension and declination,\r\nrespectively. The weight _w_ serves to counterpoise the telescope, and\r\nthe screws _s_, _s_, _s_, _s_, serve to adjust the instrument so that\r\nthe polar axis shall be in its proper position. The advantage gained by\r\nthe equatorial method of mounting is that only one motion is required to\r\nfollow a star. Owing to the diurnal rotation of the earth, the stars\r\nappear to move uniformly in circles parallel to the celestial equator;\r\nand it is clear that a star so moving will be kept in the field of\r\nview, if the telescope, once directed to the star, be made to revolve\r\nuniformly and at a proper rate round the polar axis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 9._]\r\n\r\nThe equatorial can be directed by means of the circles _c_ and _d_ to\r\nany celestial object whose right ascension and declination are known. On\r\nthe other hand, to bring an object into the field of view of an\r\nalt-azimuth, it is necessary, either that the object itself should be\r\nvisible to the naked eye, or else that the position of the object should\r\nbe pretty accurately learned from star-maps, so that it may be picked up\r\nby the alt-azimuth after a little searching. A small telescope called a\r\n_finder_ is usually attached to all powerful telescopes intended for\r\ngeneral observation. The finder has a large field of view, and is\r\nadjusted so as to have its axis parallel to that of the large telescope.\r\nThus a star brought to the centre of the large field of the finder\r\n(indicated by the intersection of two lines placed at the focus of the\r\neye-glass) is at, or very near, the centre of the small field of the\r\nlarge telescope.\r\n\r\nIf a telescope has no finder, it will be easy for the student to\r\nconstruct one for himself, and will be a useful exercise in optics. Two\r\nconvex lenses not very different in size from those shown in fig. 1, and\r\nplaced as there shown--the distance between them being the sum of the\r\nfocal lengths of the two glasses--in a small tube of card, wood, or tin,\r\nwill serve the purpose of a finder for a small telescope. It can be\r\nattached by wires to the telescope-tube, and adjusted each night before\r\ncommencing observation. The adjustment is thus managed:--a low power\r\nbeing applied to the telescope, the tube is turned towards a bright\r\nstar; this is easily effected with a low power; then the finder is to be\r\nfixed, by means of its wires, in such a position that the star shall be\r\nin the centre of the field of the finder when also in the centre of the\r\ntelescope's field. When this has been done, the finder will greatly help\r\nthe observations of the evening; since with high powers much time would\r\nbe wasted in bringing an object into the field of view of the telescope\r\nwithout the aid of a finder. Yet more time would be wasted in the case\r\nof an object not visible to the naked eye, but whose position with\r\nreference to several visible stars is known; since, while it is easy to\r\nbring the point required to the centre of the _finder's_ field, in which\r\nthe guiding stars are visible, it is very difficult to direct the\r\n_telescope's_ tube on a point of this sort. A card tube with wire\r\nfastenings, such as we have described, may appear a very insignificant\r\ncontrivance to the regular observer, with his well-mounted equatorial\r\nand carefully-adjusted finder. But to the first attempts of the amateur\r\nobserver it affords no insignificant assistance, as I can aver from my\r\nown experience. Without it--a superior finder being wanting--our\r\n\"half-hours\" would soon be wasted away in that most wearisome and\r\nannoying of all employments, trying to \"pick up\" celestial objects.\r\n\r\nIt behoves me at this point to speak of star-maps. Such maps are of many\r\ndifferent kinds. There are the Observatory maps, in which the places of\r\nthousands of stars are recorded with an amazing accuracy. Our beginner\r\nis not likely to make use of, or to want, such maps as these. Then there\r\nare maps merely intended to give a good general idea of the appearance\r\nof the heavens at different hours and seasons. Plate I. presents four\r\nmaps of this sort; but a more complete series of eight maps has been\r\npublished by Messrs. Walton and Maberly in an octavo work; and my own\r\n'Constellation-Seasons' give, at the same price, twelve quarto maps (of\r\nfour of which those in Plate I. are miniatures), showing the appearance\r\nof the sky at any hour from month to month, or on any night, at\r\nsuccessive intervals of two hours. But maps intermediate in character to\r\nthese and to Observatory maps are required by the amateur observer.\r\nSuch are the Society's six gnomonic maps, the set of six gnomonic maps\r\nin Johnstone's 'Atlas of Astronomy,' and my own set of twelve gnomonic\r\nmaps. The Society's maps are a remarkably good set, containing on the\r\nscale of a ten-inch globe all the stars in the Catalogue of the\r\nAstronomical Society (down to the fifth magnitude). The distortion,\r\nhowever, is necessarily enormous when the celestial sphere is presented\r\nin only six gnomonic maps. In my maps all the stars of the British\r\nAssociation Catalogue down to the fifth magnitude are included on the\r\nscale of a six-inch globe. The distortion is scarcely a fourth of that\r\nin the Society's maps. The maps are so arranged that the relative\r\npositions of all the stars in each hemisphere can be readily gathered\r\nfrom a single view; and black duplicate-maps serve to show the\r\nappearance of the constellations.\r\n\r\nIt is often convenient to make small maps of a part of the heavens we\r\nmay wish to study closely. My 'Handbook of the Stars' has been prepared\r\nto aid the student in the construction of such maps.\r\n\r\nIn selecting maps it is well to be able to recognise the amount of\r\ndistortion and scale-variation. This may be done by examining the spaces\r\nincluded between successive parallels and meridians, near the edges and\r\nangles of the maps, and comparing these either with those in the centre\r\nof the map, or with the known figures and dimensions of the\r\ncorresponding spaces on a globe.\r\n\r\nWe may now proceed to discuss the different tests which the intending\r\npurchaser of a telescope should apply to the instrument.\r\n\r\nThe excellence of an object-glass can be satisfactorily determined only\r\nby testing the performance of the telescope in the manner presently to\r\nbe described. But it is well to examine the quality of the glass as\r\nrespects transparency and uniformity of texture. Bubbles, scratches, and\r\nother such defects, are not very important, since they do not affect the\r\ndistinctness of the field as they would in a Galilean Telescope,--a\r\nlittle light is lost, and that is all. The same remark applies to dust\r\nupon the glass. The glass should be kept as free as possible from dirt,\r\ndamp, or dust, but it is not advisable to remove every speck which,\r\ndespite such precaution, may accidentally fall upon the object-glass.\r\nWhen it becomes necessary to clean the glass, it is to be noted that the\r\nsubstance used should be soft, perfectly dry, and free from dust. Silk\r\nis often recommended, but some silk is exceedingly objectionable in\r\ntexture,--old silk, perfectly soft to the touch, is perhaps as good as\r\nanything. If the dust which has fallen on the glass is at all gritty,\r\nthe glass will suffer by the method of cleaning commonly adopted, in\r\nwhich the dust is _gathered up_ by pressure. The proper method is to\r\nclean a small space near the edge of the glass, and to _sweep_ from that\r\nspace as centre. In this way the dust is _pushed before_ the silk or\r\nwash-leather, and does not cut the glass. It is well always to suspect\r\nthe presence of gritty dust, and adopt this cautious method of cleaning.\r\n\r\nThe two glasses should on no account be separated.\r\n\r\nIn examining an eye-piece, the quality of the glass should be noted, and\r\ncare taken that both glasses (but especially the field-glass) are free\r\nfrom the least speck, scratch, or blemish of any kind, for these defects\r\nwill be exhibited in a magnified state in the field of view. Hence the\r\neye-pieces require to be as carefully preserved from damp and dust as\r\nthe object-glass, and to be more frequently cleaned.\r\n\r\nThe tube of the telescope should be light, but strong, and free from\r\nvibration. Its quality in the last respect can be tested by lightly\r\nstriking it when mounted; the sound given out should be dead or\r\nnon-resonant. The inside of the tube must absorb extraneous light, and\r\nshould therefore be coloured a dull black; and stops of varying radius\r\nshould be placed along its length with the same object. Sliding tubes,\r\nrack-work, etc., should work closely, yet easily.\r\n\r\nThe telescope should be well balanced for vision with the small\r\nastronomical eye-pieces. But as there is often occasion to use\r\nappliances which disturb the balance, it is well to have the means of at\r\nonce restoring equilibrium. A cord ring running round the tube (pretty\r\ntightly, so as to rest still when the tube is inclined), and bearing a\r\nsmall weight, will be all that is required for this purpose; it must be\r\nslipped along the tube until the tube is found to be perfectly balanced.\r\nNothing is more annoying than, after getting a star well in the field,\r\nto see the tube shift its position through defective balance, and thus\r\nto have to search again for the star. Even with such an arrangement as\r\nis shown in fig. 8, though the tube cannot readily shift its position,\r\nit is better to have it well balanced.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the stand has a very important influence on the\r\nperformance of a telescope. In fact, a moderately good telescope,\r\nmounted on a steady stand, working easily and conveniently, will not\r\nonly enable the observer to pass his time much more pleasantly, but will\r\nabsolutely exhibit more difficult objects than a finer instrument on a\r\nrickety, ill-arranged stand. A good observing-chair is also a matter of\r\nsome importance, the least constraint or awkwardness of position\r\ndetracting considerably from the power of distinct vision. Such, at\r\nleast, is my own experience.\r\n\r\nBut the mere examination of the glasses, tube, mounting, &c., is only\r\nthe first step in the series of tests which should be applied to a\r\ntelescope, since the excellence of the instrument depends, not on its\r\nsize, the beauty of its mounting, or any extraneous circumstances, but\r\non its performance.\r\n\r\nThe observer should first determine whether the chromatic aberration is\r\ncorrected. To ascertain this the telescope should be directed to the\r\nmoon, or (better) to Jupiter, and accurately focussed for distinct\r\nvision. If, then, on moving the eye-piece towards the object-glass, a\r\nring of purple appears round the margin of the object, and on moving the\r\neye-glass in the contrary direction a ring of green, the chromatic\r\naberration is corrected, since these are the colours of the secondary\r\nspectrum.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether the spherical aberration is corrected, the\r\ntelescope should be directed towards a star of the third or fourth\r\nmagnitude, and focussed for distinct vision. A cap with an aperture of\r\nabout one-half its diameter should then be placed over the object-glass.\r\nIf no new adjustment is required for distinct vision, the spherical\r\naberration is corrected, since the mean focal length and the focal\r\nlength of the central rays are equal. If, when the cap is on, the\r\neye-piece has to be pulled out for distinct vision, the spherical\r\naberration has not been fully corrected; if the eye-piece has to be\r\npushed in, the aberration has been over-corrected. As a further test, we\r\nmay cut off the central rays, by means of a circular card covering the\r\nmiddle of the object-glass, and compare the focal length for distinct\r\nvision with the focal length when the cap is applied. The extent of the\r\nspherical aberration may be thus determined; but if the first experiment\r\ngives a satisfactory result, no other is required.\r\n\r\nA star of the first magnitude should next be brought into the field of\r\nview. If an irradiation from one side is perceived, part of the\r\nobject-glass has not the same refractive power as the rest; and the\r\npart which is defective can be determined by applying in different\r\npositions a cap which hides half the object-glass. If the irradiation is\r\ndouble, it will probably be found that the object-glass has been too\r\ntightly screwed, and the defect will disappear when the glass is freed\r\nfrom such undue pressure.\r\n\r\nIf the object-glass is not quite at right angles to the axis of the\r\ntube, or if the eye-tube is at all inclined, a like irradiation will\r\nappear when a bright star is in the field. The former defect is not\r\neasily detected or remedied; nor is it commonly met with in the work of\r\na careful optician. The latter defect may be detected by cutting out\r\nthree circular cards of suitable size with a small aperture at the\r\ncentre of each, and inserting one at each end of the eye-tube, and one\r\nover the object-glass. If the tube is rightly placed the apertures will\r\nof course lie in a right line, so that it will be possible to look\r\nthrough all three at once. If not, it will be easy to determine towards\r\nwhat part of the object-glass the eye-tube is directed, and to correct\r\nthe position of the tube accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe best tests for determining the defining power of a telescope are\r\nclose double or multiple stars, the components of which are not very\r\nunequal. The illuminating power should be tested by directing the\r\ntelescope towards double or multiple stars having one or more minute\r\ncomponents. Many of the nebulæ serve as tests both for illumination and\r\ndefining power. As we proceed we shall meet with proper objects for\r\ntesting different telescopes. For the present, let the following list\r\nsuffice. It is selected from Admiral Smyth's tests, obtained by\r\ndiminishing the aperture of a 6-in. telescope having a focal length of\r\n8-1/2 feet:\r\n\r\nA two-inch aperture, with powers of from 60 to 100, should exhibit\r\n\r\n[alpha] Piscium (3\"·5).   | [delta] Cassiopeiæ (9\"·5),\r\n                          |    mag. (4 and 7-1/2)\r\n[gamma] Leonis  (3\"·2).   | Polaris (18\"·6), mag. (2-1/2\r\n                          |    and 9-1/2)\r\n\r\nA four-inch, powers 80 to 120, should exhibit\r\n\r\n[xi] Ursæ Majoris (2\"·4). | [sigma] Cassiopeiæ (3\"·1),\r\n                          |    mag. (6 and 8).\r\n[gamma] Ceti (2\"·6).      | [delta] Geminorum (7\"·1),\r\n                          |    mag. (4 and 9).\r\n\r\nThe tests in the first column are for definition, those in the second\r\nfor illumination. It will be noticed that, though in the case of Polaris\r\nthe smaller aperture may be expected to show the small star of less than\r\nthe 9th magnitude, a larger aperture is required to show the 8th\r\nmagnitude component of [sigma] Cassiopeiæ, on account of the greater\r\ncloseness of this double.\r\n\r\nIn favourable weather the following is a good general test of the\r\nperformance of a telescope:--A star of the 3rd or 4th magnitude at a\r\nconsiderable elevation above the horizon should exhibit a small well\r\ndefined disc, surrounded by two or three fine rings of light.\r\n\r\nA telescope should not be mounted within doors, if it can be\r\nconveniently erected on solid ground, as every movement in the house\r\nwill cause the instrument to vibrate unpleasantly. Further, if the\r\ntelescope is placed in a warm room, currents of cold air from without\r\nwill render observed objects hazy and indistinct. In fact, Sir W.\r\nHerschel considered that a telescope should not even be erected near a\r\nhouse or elevation of any kind round which currents of air are likely to\r\nbe produced. If a telescope is used in a room, the temperature of the\r\nroom should be made as nearly equal as possible to that of the outer\r\nair.\r\n\r\nWhen a telescope is used out of doors a 'dew-cap,' that is, a tube of\r\ntin or pasteboard, some ten or twelve inches long, should be placed on\r\nthe end of the instrument, so as to project beyond the object-glass. For\r\nglass is a good radiator of heat, so that dew falls heavily upon it,\r\nunless the radiation is in some way checked. The dew-cap does this\r\neffectually. It should be blackened within, especially if made of metal.\r\n\"After use,\" says old Kitchener, \"the telescope should be kept in a warm\r\nplace long enough for any moisture on the object-glass to evaporate.\" If\r\ndamp gets between the glasses it produces a fog (which opticians call a\r\nsweat) or even a seaweed-like vegetation, by which a valuable glass may\r\nbe completely ruined.\r\n\r\nThe observer should not leave to the precious hours of the night the\r\nstudy of the bearing and position of the objects he proposes to examine.\r\nThis should be done by day--an arrangement which has a twofold\r\nadvantage,--the time available for observation is lengthened, and the\r\neyes are spared sudden changes from darkness to light, and _vice versâ_.\r\nBesides, the eye is ill-fitted to examine difficult objects, after\r\nsearching by candle-light amongst the minute details recorded in maps or\r\nglobes. Of the effect of rest to the eye we have an instance in Sir J.\r\nHerschel's rediscovery of the satellites of Uranus, which he effected\r\nafter keeping his eyes in darkness for a quarter of an hour. Kitchener,\r\nindeed, goes so far as to recommend (with a _crede experto_) an\r\n_interval of sleep_ in the darkness of the observing-room before\r\ncommencing operations. I have never tried the experiment, but I should\r\nexpect it to have a bad rather than a good effect on the eyesight, as\r\none commonly sees the eyes of a person who has been sleeping in his\r\nday-clothes look heavy and bloodshot.\r\n\r\nThe object or the part of an object to be observed should be brought as\r\nnearly as possible to the centre of the field of view. When there is no\r\napparatus for keeping the telescope pointed upon an object, the best\r\nplan is so to direct the telescope by means of the finder, that the\r\nobject shall be just out of the field of view, and be brought (by the\r\nearth's motion) across the centre of the field. Thus the vibrations\r\nwhich always follow the adjustment of the tube will have subsided before\r\nthe object appears. The object should then be intently watched during\r\nthe whole interval of its passage across the field of view.\r\n\r\nIt is important that the student should recognise the fact that the\r\nhighest powers do not necessarily give the best views of celestial\r\nobjects. High powers in all cases increase the difficulty of\r\nobservation, since they diminish the field of view and the illumination\r\nof the object, increase the motion with which (owing to the earth's\r\nmotion) the image moves across the field, and magnify all defects due to\r\ninstability of the stand, imperfection of the object-glass, or\r\nundulation of the atmosphere. A good object-glass of three inches\r\naperture will in very favourable weather bear a power of about 300, when\r\napplied to the observation of close double or multiple stars, but for\r\nall other observations much lower powers should be used. Nothing but\r\nfailure and annoyance can follow the attempt to employ the highest\r\npowers on unsuitable objects or in unfavourable weather.\r\n\r\nThe greatest care should be taken in focussing the telescope. When high\r\npowers are used this is a matter of some delicacy. It would be well if\r\nthe eye-pieces intended for a telescope were so constructed that when\r\nthe telescope is focussed for one, this might be replaced by any other\r\nwithout necessitating any use of the focussing rack-work. This could be\r\nreadily effected by suitably placing the shoulder which limits the\r\ninsertion of the eye-piece.\r\n\r\nIt will be found that, even in the worst weather for observation, there\r\nare instants of distinct vision (with moderate powers) during which the\r\ncareful observer may catch sight of important details; and, similarly,\r\nin the best observing weather, there are moments of unusually distinct\r\nvision well worth patient waiting for, since in such weather alone the\r\nfull powers of the telescope can be employed.\r\n\r\nThe telescopist should not be deterred from observation by the presence\r\nof fog or haze, since with a hazy sky definition is often singularly\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nThe observer must not expect distinct vision of objects near the\r\nhorizon. Objects near the eastern horizon during the time of morning\r\ntwilight are especially confused by atmospheric undulations; in fact,\r\nearly morning is a very unfavourable time for the observation of all\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nThe same rules which we have been applying to refractors, serve for\r\nreflectors. The performance of a reflector will be found to differ in\r\nsome respects, however, from that of a refractor. Mr. Dawes is, we\r\nbelieve, now engaged in testing reflectors, and his unequalled\r\nexperience of refractors will enable him to pronounce decisively on the\r\nrelative merits of the two classes of telescopes.\r\n\r\nWe have little to say respecting the construction of telescopes. Whether\r\nit is advisable or not for an amateur observer to attempt the\r\nconstruction of his own telescope is a question depending entirely on\r\nhis mechanical ability and ingenuity. My own experience of telescope\r\nconstruction is confined to the conversion of a 3-feet into a 5-1/2-feet\r\ntelescope. This operation involved some difficulties, since the aperture\r\nhad to be increased by about an inch. I found a tubing made of alternate\r\nlayers of card and calico well pasted together, to be both light and\r\nstrong. But for the full length of tube I think a core of metal is\r\nwanted. A learned and ingenious friend, Mr. Sharp, Fellow of St. John's\r\nCollege, informs me that a tube of tin, covered with layers of brown\r\npaper, well pasted and thicker near the middle of the tube, forms a\r\nlight and strong telescope-tube, almost wholly free from vibration.\r\n\r\nSuffer no inexperienced person to deal with your object-glass. I knew a\r\nvaluable glass ruined by the proceedings of a workman who had been told\r\nto attach three pieces of brass round the cell of the double lens. What\r\nhe had done remained unknown, but ever after a wretched glare of light\r\nsurrounded all objects of any brilliancy.\r\n\r\nOne word about the inversion of objects by the astronomical telescope.\r\nIt is singular that any difficulty should be felt about so simple a\r\nmatter, yet I have seen in the writings of more than one distinguished\r\nastronomer, wholly incorrect views as to the nature of the inversion.\r\nOne tells us that to obtain the correct presentation from a picture\r\ntaken with a telescope, the view should be inverted, held up to the\r\nlight, and looked at from the back of the paper. Another tells us to\r\ninvert the picture and hold it opposite a looking-glass. Neither method\r\nis correct. The simple correction wanted is to hold the picture upside\r\ndown--the same change which brings the top to the bottom brings the\r\nright to the left, _i.e._, fully corrects the inversion.\r\n\r\nIn the case, however, of a picture taken by an Herschelian reflector,\r\nthe inversion not being complete, a different method must be adopted. In\r\nfact, either of the above-named processes, incorrect for the ordinary\r\nastronomical, would be correct for the Herschelian Telescope. The latter\r\ninverts but does not reverse right and left; therefore after inverting\r\nour picture we must interchange right and left because they have been\r\nreversed by the inversion. This is effected either by looking at the\r\npicture from behind, or by holding it up to a mirror.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nA HALF-HOUR WITH ORION, LEPUS TAURUS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny of the half-hours here assigned to the constellation-seasons may be\r\ntaken first, and the rest in seasonal or cyclic order. The following\r\nintroductory remarks are applicable to each:--\r\n\r\nIf we stand on an open space, on any clear night, we see above us the\r\ncelestial dome spangled with stars, apparently fixed in position. But\r\nafter a little time it becomes clear that these orbs are slowly shifting\r\ntheir position. Those near the eastern horizon are rising, those near\r\nthe western setting. Careful and continuous observation would show that\r\nthe stars are all moving in the same way, precisely, as they would if\r\nthey were fixed to the concave surface of a vast hollow sphere, and this\r\nsphere rotated about an axis. This axis, in our latitude, is inclined\r\nabout 51-1/2° to the horizon. Of course only one end of this imaginary\r\naxis can be above our horizon. This end lies very near a star which it\r\nwill be well for us to become acquainted with at the beginning of our\r\noperations. It lies almost exactly towards the north, and is raised from\r\n50° to 53° (according to the season and hour) above the horizon. There\r\nis an easy method of finding it.\r\n\r\nWe must first find the Greater Bear. It will be seen from Plate 1, that\r\non a spring evening the seven conspicuous stars of this constellation\r\nare to be looked for towards the north-east, about half way between the\r\nhorizon and the point overhead (or _zenith_), the length of the set of\r\nstars being vertical. On a summer's evening the Great Bear is nearly\r\noverhead. On an autumn evening he is towards the north-west, the length\r\nof the set of seven being somewhat inclined to the horizon. Finally, on\r\na winter's evening, he is low down towards the north, the length of the\r\nset of seven stars being nearly in a horizontal direction.\r\n\r\nHaving found the seven stars, we make use of the pointers [alpha] and\r\n[beta] (shown in Plate 1) to indicate the place of the Pole-star, whose\r\ndistance from the pointer [alpha] is rather more than three times the\r\ndistance of [alpha] from [beta].\r\n\r\nNow stand facing the Pole-star. Then all the stars are travelling round\r\nthat star _in a direction contrary to that in which the hands of a watch\r\nmove_. Thus the stars below the pole are moving _towards the right_,\r\nthose above the pole _towards the left_, those to the right of the pole\r\n_upwards_, those to the left of the pole _downwards_.\r\n\r\nNext face the south. Then all the stars on our left, that is, towards\r\nthe east, are rising slantingly towards the south; those due south are\r\nmoving horizontally to the right, that is, towards the west; and those\r\non our right are passing slantingly downwards towards the west.\r\n\r\nIt is important to familiarise ourselves with these motions, because it\r\nis through them that objects pass out of the field of view of the\r\ntelescope, and by moving the tube in a proper direction we can easily\r\npick up an object that has thus passed away, whereas if we are not\r\nfamiliar with the varying motions in different parts of the celestial\r\nsphere, we may fail in the attempt to immediately recover an object, and\r\nwaste time in the search for it.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of the celestial motions shows how advantageous it is,\r\nwhen using an alt-azimuth, to observe objects as nearly as possible due\r\nsouth. Of course in many cases this is impracticable, because a\r\nphenomenon we wish to watch may occur when an object is not situated\r\nnear the meridian. But in examining double stars there is in general no\r\nreason for selecting objects inconveniently situated. We can wait till\r\nthey come round to the meridian, and then observe them more comfortably.\r\nBesides, most objects are higher, and therefore better seen, when due\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nNorthern objects, and especially those within the circle of perpetual\r\napparition, often culminate (that is, cross the meridian, or north and\r\nsouth line) at too great a height for comfortable vision. In this case\r\nwe should observe them towards the east or west, and remember that in\r\nthe first case they are rising, and in the latter they are setting, and\r\nthat in both cases they have also a motion from left to right.\r\n\r\nIf we allow an object to pass right across the field of view (the\r\ntelescope being fixed), the apparent direction of its motion is the\r\nexact reverse of the true direction of the star's motion. This will\r\nserve as a guide in shifting the alt-azimuth after a star has passed out\r\nof the field of view.\r\n\r\nThe following technical terms must be explained. That part of the field\r\nof view towards which the star appears to move is called the _preceding_\r\npart of the field, the opposite being termed the _following_ part. The\r\nmotion for all stars, except those lying in an oval space extending from\r\nthe zenith to the pole of the heavens, is more or less from right to\r\nleft (in the inverted field). Now, if we suppose a star to move along a\r\ndiameter of the field so as to divide the field into two semicircles,\r\nthen in all cases in which this motion takes places from right to left,\r\nthat semicircle which contains the lowest point (apparently) of the\r\nfield is the _northern_ half, the other is the _southern_ half. Over the\r\noval space just mentioned the reverse holds.\r\n\r\nThus the field is divided into four quadrants, and these are termed\r\n_north following_ (_n.f._) and _south following_ (_s.f._); _north\r\npreceding_ (_n.p._), and _south preceding_ (_s.p._). The student can\r\nhave no difficulty in interpreting these terms, since he knows which is\r\nthe following and which the preceding _semicircle_, which the northern\r\nand which the southern. In the figures of plates 3 and 5, the letters\r\n_n.f._, _n.p._, &c., are affixed to the proper quadrants. It is to be\r\nremembered that the quadrants thus indicated are measured either way\r\nfrom the point and feather of the diametral arrows.\r\n\r\nNext, of the apparent annual motion of the stars. This takes place in\r\nexactly the same manner as the daily motion. If we view the sky at eight\r\no'clock on any day, and again at the same hour one month later, we shall\r\nfind that at the latter observation (as compared with the former) the\r\nheavens appear to have rotated by the _twelfth part_ of a complete\r\ncircumference, and the appearance presented is precisely the same as we\r\nshould have observed had we waited for two hours (the _twelfth part_ of\r\na day) on the day of the first observation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur survey of the heavens is supposed to be commenced during the first\r\nquarter of the year, at ten o'clock on the 20th of January, or at nine\r\non the 5th of February, or at eight on the 19th of February, or at seven\r\non the 6th of March, or at hours intermediate to these on intermediate\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nWe look first for the Great Bear towards the north-east, as already\r\ndescribed, and thence find the Pole-star; turning towards which we see,\r\ntowards the right and downwards, the two guardians of the pole ([beta]\r\nand [gamma] Ursæ Minoris). Immediately under the Pole-star is the\r\nDragon's Head, a conspicuous diamond of stars. Just on the horizon is\r\nVega, scintillating brilliantly. Overhead is the brilliant Capella, near\r\nwhich the Milky Way is seen passing down to the horizon on either side\r\ntowards the quarters S.S.E. and N.N.W.\r\n\r\nFor the present our business is with the southern heavens, however.\r\n\r\nFacing the south, we see a brilliant array of stars, Sirius\r\nunmistakeably overshining the rest. Orion is shining in full glory, his\r\nleading brilliant, Betelgeuse[2] being almost exactly on the meridian,\r\nand also almost exactly half way between the horizon and the zenith. In\r\nPlate 2 is given a map of this constellation and its neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nLet us first turn the tube on Sirius. It is easy to get him in the field\r\nwithout the aid of a finder. The search will serve to illustrate a\r\nmethod often useful when a telescope has no finder. Having taking out\r\nthe eye-piece--a low-power one, suppose--direct the tube nearly towards\r\nSirius. On looking through it, a glare of light will be seen within the\r\ntube. Now, if the tube be slightly moved about, the light will be seen\r\nto wax and wane, according as the tube is more or less accurately\r\ndirected. Following these indications, it will be found easy to direct\r\nthe tube, so that the object-glass shall appear _full of light_. When\r\nthis is done, insert the eye-piece, and the star will be seen in the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nBut the telescope is out of focus, therefore we must turn the small\r\nfocussing screw. Observe the charming chromatic changes--green, and\r\nred, and blue light, purer than the hues of the rainbow, scintillating\r\nand coruscating with wonderful brilliancy. As we get the focus, the\r\nexcursions of these light flashes diminish until--if the weather is\r\nfavourable--the star is seen, still scintillating, and much brighter\r\nthan to the naked eye, but reduced to a small disc of light, surrounded\r\n(in the case of so bright a star as Sirius) with a slight glare. If\r\nafter obtaining the focus the focussing rack work be still turned, we\r\nsee a coruscating image as before. In the case of a very brilliant star\r\nthese coruscations are so charming that we may be excused for calling\r\nthe observer's attention to them. The subject is not without interest\r\nand difficulty as an optical one. But the astronomer's object is to get\r\nrid of all these flames and sprays of coloured light, so that he has\r\nvery little sympathy with the admiration which Wordsworth is said to\r\nhave expressed for out-of-focus views of the stars.\r\n\r\nWe pass to more legitimate observations, noticing in passing that Sirius\r\nis a double star, the companion being of the tenth magnitude, and\r\ndistant about ten seconds from the primary. But our beginner is not\r\nlikely to see the companion, which is a very difficult object, vowing to\r\nthe overpowering brilliancy of the primary.\r\n\r\nOrion affords the observer a splendid field of research. It is a\r\nconstellation rich in double and multiple stars, clusters, and nebulæ.\r\nWe will begin with an easy object.\r\n\r\nThe star [delta] (Plate 3), or _Mintaka_, the uppermost of the three\r\nstars forming the belt, is a wide double. The primary is of the second\r\nmagnitude, the secondary of the seventh, both being white.\r\n\r\nThe star [alpha] (_Betelgeuse_) is an interesting object, on account of\r\nits colour and brilliance, and as one of the most remarkable variables\r\nin the heavens. It was first observed to be variable by Sir John\r\nHerschel in 1836. At this period its variations were \"most marked and\r\nstriking.\" This continued until 1840, when the changes became \"much less\r\nconspicuous. In January, 1849, they had recommenced, and on December\r\n5th, 1852, Mr. Fletcher observed [alpha] Orionis brighter than Capella,\r\nand actually the largest star in the northern hemisphere.\" That a star\r\nso conspicuous, and presumably so large, should present such remarkable\r\nvariations, is a circumstance which adds an additional interest to the\r\nresults which have rewarded the spectrum-analysis of this star by Mr.\r\nHuggins and Professor Miller. It appears that there is decisive evidence\r\nof the presence in this luminary of many elements known to exist in our\r\nown sun; amongst others are found sodium, magnesium, calcium, iron, and\r\nbismuth. Hydrogen appears to be absent, or, more correctly, there are no\r\nlines in the star's spectrum corresponding to those of hydrogen in the\r\nsolar spectrum. Secchi considers that there is evidence of an actual\r\nchange in the spectrum of the star, an opinion in which Mr. Huggins does\r\nnot coincide. In the telescope Betelgeuse appears as \"a rich and\r\nbrilliant gem,\" says Lassell, \"a rich topaz, in hue and brilliancy\r\ndiffering from any that I have seen.\"\r\n\r\nTurn next to [beta] (Rigel), the brightest star below the belt. This is\r\na very noted double, and will severely test our observer's telescope, if\r\nsmall. The components are well separated (see Plate 3), compared with\r\nmany easier doubles; the secondary is also of the seventh magnitude, so\r\nthat neither as respects closeness nor smallness of the secondary, is\r\nRigel a difficult object. It is the combination of the two features\r\nwhich makes it a test-object. Kitchener says a 1-3/4-inch object-glass\r\nshould show Rigel double; in earlier editions of his work he gave\r\n2-3/4-inches as the necessary aperture. Smyth mentions Rigel as a test\r\nfor a 4-inch aperture, with powers of from 80 to 120. A 3-inch aperture,\r\nhowever, will certainly show the companion. Rigel is an orange star, the\r\ncompanion blue.\r\n\r\nTurn next to [lambda] the northernmost of the set of three stars in the\r\nhead of Orion. This is a triple star, though an aperture of 3 inches\r\nwill show it only as a double. The components are 5\" apart, the colours\r\npale white and violet. With the full powers of a 3-1/2-inch glass a\r\nfaint companion may be seen above [lambda].\r\n\r\nThe star [zeta], the lowest in the belt, may be tried with a 3-1/2-inch\r\nglass. It is a close double, the components being nearly equal, and\r\nabout 2-1/2\" apart (see Plate 3).\r\n\r\nFor a change we will now try our telescope on a nebula, selecting the\r\ngreat nebula in the Sword. The place of this object is indicated in\r\nPlate 2. There can be no difficulty in finding it since it is clearly\r\nvisible to the naked eye on a moonless night--the only sort of night on\r\nwhich an observer would care to look at nebulæ. A low power should be\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nThe nebula is shown in Plate 3 as I have seen it with a 3-inch aperture.\r\nWe see nothing of those complex streams of light which are portrayed in\r\nthe drawings of Herschel, Bond, and Lassell, but enough to excite our\r\ninterest and wonder. What is this marvellous light-cloud? One could\r\nalmost imagine that there was a strange prophetic meaning in the words\r\nwhich have been translated \"Canst thou loose the bands of Orion?\"\r\nTelescope after telescope had been turned on this wonderful object with\r\nthe hope of resolving its light into stars. But it proved intractable to\r\nHerschel's great reflector, to Lassell's 2-feet reflector, to Lord\r\nRosse's 3-feet reflector, and even partially to the great 6-feet\r\nreflector. Then we hear of its supposed resolution into stars, Lord\r\nRosse himself writing to Professor Nichol, in 1846, \"I may safely say\r\nthere can be little, if any, doubt as to the resolvability of the\r\nnebula;--all about the trapezium is a mass of stars, the rest of the\r\nnebula also abounding with stars, and exhibiting the characteristics of\r\nresolvability strongly marked.\"\r\n\r\nIt was decided, therefore, that assuredly the great nebula is a\r\ncongeries of stars, and not a mass of nebulous matter as had been\r\nsurmised by Sir W. Herschel. And therefore astronomers were not a little\r\nsurprised when it was proved by Mr. Huggins' spectrum-analysis that the\r\nnebula consists of gaseous matter. How widely extended this gaseous\r\nuniverse may be we cannot say. The general opinion is that the nebulæ\r\nare removed far beyond the fixed stars. If this were so, the dimensions\r\nof the Orion nebula would be indeed enormous, far larger probably than\r\nthose of the whole system whereof our sun is a member. I believe this\r\nview is founded on insufficient evidence, but this would not be the\r\nplace to discuss the subject. I shall merely point out that the nebula\r\noccurs in a region rich in stars, and if it is not, like the great\r\nnebula in Argo, clustered around a remarkable star, it is found\r\nassociated in a manner which I cannot look upon as accidental with a set\r\nof small-magnitude stars, and notably with the trapezium which surrounds\r\nthat very remarkable black gap within the nebula. The fact that the\r\nnebula shares the proper motion of the trapezium appears inexplicable if\r\nthe nebula is really far out in space beyond the trapezium. A very small\r\nproper motion of the trapezium (alone) would long since have destroyed\r\nthe remarkable agreement in the position of the dark gap and the\r\ntrapezium which has been noticed for so many years.\r\n\r\nBut whether belonging to our system or far beyond it, the great nebula\r\nmust have enormous dimensions. A vast gaseous system it is, sustained by\r\nwhat arrangements or forces we cannot tell, nor can we know what\r\npurposes it subserves. Mr. Huggins' discovery that comets have gaseous\r\nnuclei, (so far as the two he has yet examined show) may suggest the\r\nspeculation that in the Orion nebula we see a vast system of comets\r\ntravelling in extensive orbits around nuclear stars, and so slowly as to\r\nexhibit for long intervals of time an unchanged figure. \"But of such\r\nspeculations\" we may say with Sir J. Herschel \"there is no end.\"\r\n\r\nTo return to our telescopic observations:--The trapezium affords a\r\nuseful test for the light-gathering power of the telescope. Large\r\ninstruments exhibit nine stars. But our observer may be well satisfied\r\nwith his instrument and his eye-sight if he can see five with a\r\n3-1/2-inch aperture.[3] A good 3-inch glass shows four distinctly. But\r\nwith smaller apertures only three are visible.\r\n\r\nThe whole neighbourhood of the great nebula will well repay research.\r\nThe observer may sweep over it carefully on any dark night with profit.\r\nAbove the nebula is the star-cluster 362 H. The star [iota] (double as\r\nshown in Plate 3) below the nebula is involved in a strong nebulosity.\r\nAnd in searching over this region we meet with delicate double, triple,\r\nand multiple stars, which make the survey interesting with almost any\r\npower that may be applied.\r\n\r\nAbove the nebula is the star [sigma], a multiple star. To an observer\r\nwith a good 3-1/2-inch glass [sigma] appears as an octuple star. It is\r\nwell seen, however, as a fine multiple star with a smaller aperture.\r\nSome of the stars of this group appear to be variable.\r\n\r\nThe star [rho] Orionis is an unequal, easy double, the components being\r\nseparated by nearly seven seconds. The primary is orange, the smaller\r\nstar smalt-blue (see Plate 3).\r\n\r\nThe middle star of the belt ([epsilon]) has a distant blue companion.\r\nThis star, like [iota], is nebulous. In fact, the whole region within\r\nthe triangle formed by stars [gamma], [kappa] and [beta] is full of\r\nnebulous double and multiple stars, whose aggregation in this region I\r\ndo not consider wholly accidental.\r\n\r\nWe have not explored half the wealth of Orion, but leave much for future\r\nobservation. We must turn, however, to other constellations.\r\n\r\nBelow Orion is Lepus, the Hare, a small constellation containing some\r\nremarkable doubles. Among these we may note [xi], a white star with a\r\nscarlet companion; [gamma], a yellow and garnet double; and [iota], a\r\ndouble star, white and pale violet, with a distant red companion. The\r\nstar [kappa] Leporis is a rather close double, white with a small green\r\ncompanion. The intensely red star R Leporis (a variable) will be found\r\nin the position indicated in the map.\r\n\r\nStill keeping within the boundary of our map, we may next turn to the\r\nfine cluster 2 H (vii.) in Monoceros. This cluster is visible to the\r\nnaked eye, and will be easily found. The nebula 2 H (iv.) is a\r\nremarkable one with a powerful telescope.\r\n\r\nThe star 11 Monocerotis is a fine triple star described by the elder\r\nHerschel as one of the finest sights in the heavens. Our observer,\r\nhowever, will see it as a double (see Plate 3). [delta] Monocerotis is\r\nan easy double, yellow and lavender.\r\n\r\nWe may now leave the region covered by the map and take a survey of the\r\nheavens for some objects well seen at this season.\r\n\r\nTowards the south-east, high up above the horizon, we see the twin-stars\r\nCastor and Pollux. The upper is Castor, the finest double star visible\r\nin the northern heavens. The components are nearly equal and rather more\r\nthan 5\" apart (see Plate 3). Both are white according to the best\r\nobservers, but the smaller is thought by some to be slightly greenish.\r\n\r\nPollux is a coarse but fine triple star (in large instruments multiple).\r\nThe components orange, grey, and lilac.\r\n\r\nThere are many other fine objects in Gemini, but we pass to Cancer.\r\n\r\nThe fine cluster Præsepe in Cancer may easily be found as it is\r\ndistinctly visible to the naked eye in the position shown in Plate 1,\r\nMap I. In the telescope it is seen as shown in Plate 3.\r\n\r\nThe star [iota] Cancri is a wide double, the colours orange and blue.\r\n\r\nProcyon, the first-magnitude star between Præsepe and Sirius, is finely\r\ncoloured--yellow with a distant orange companion, which appears to be\r\nvariable.\r\n\r\nBelow the Twins, almost in a line with them, is the star [alpha] Hydræ,\r\ncalled Al Fard, or \"the Solitary One.\" It is a 2nd magnitude variable. I\r\nmention it, however, not on its own account, but as a guide to the fine\r\ndouble [epsilon] Hydræ. This star is the middle one of a group of three,\r\nlying between Pollux and Al Fard rather nearer the latter. The\r\ncomponents of [epsilon] Hydræ are separated by about 3-1/2\" (see Plate\r\n3). The primary is of the fourth, the companion of the eighth magnitude;\r\nthe former is yellow, the latter a ruddy purple. The period of [epsilon]\r\nHydræ is about 450 years.\r\n\r\nThe constellation Leo Minor, now due east and about midway between the\r\nhorizon and the zenith, is well worth sweeping over. It contains several\r\nfine fields.\r\n\r\nLet us next turn to the western heavens. Here there are some noteworthy\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are the Pleiades, showing to the naked eye only six\r\nor seven stars. In the telescope the Pleiades appear as shown in Plate\r\n3.\r\n\r\nThe Hyades also show some fine fields with low powers.\r\n\r\nAldebaran, the principal star of the Hyades, as also of the\r\nconstellation Taurus, is a noted red star. It is chiefly remarkable for\r\nthe close spectroscopic analysis to which it has been subjected by\r\nMessrs. Huggins and Miller. Unlike Betelgeuse, the spectrum of Aldebaran\r\nexhibits the lines corresponding to hydrogen, and no less than eight\r\nmetals--sodium, magnesium, calcium, iron, bismuth, tellurium, antimony,\r\nand mercury, are proved to exist in the constitution of this brilliant\r\nred star.\r\n\r\nOn the right of Aldebaran, in the position indicated in Plate 1, Map I.,\r\nare the stars [zeta] and [beta] Tauri. If with a low power the observer\r\nsweep from [zeta] towards [beta], he will soon find--not far from [zeta]\r\n(at a distance of about one-sixth of the distance separating [beta] from\r\n[zeta]), the celebrated Crab nebula, known as 1 M. This was the first\r\nnebula discovered by Messier, and its discovery led to the formation of\r\nhis catalogue of 103 nebulæ. In a small telescope this object appears as\r\na nebulous light of oval form, no traces being seen of the wisps and\r\nsprays of light presented in Lord Rosse's well known picture of the\r\nnebula.\r\n\r\nHere I shall conclude the labours of our first half-hour among the\r\nstars, noticing that the examination of Plate 1 will show what other\r\nconstellations besides those here considered are well situated for\r\nobservation at this season. It will be remarked that many constellations\r\nwell seen in the third half-hour (Chapter IV.) are favourably seen in\r\nthe first also, and _vice versâ_. For instance, the constellation Ursa\r\nMajor well-placed towards the north-east in the first quarter of the\r\nyear, is equally well-placed towards the north-west in the third, and\r\nsimilarly of the constellation Cassiopeia. The same relation connects\r\nthe second and fourth quarters of the year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nA HALF-HOUR WITH LYRA, HERCULES, CORVUS, CRATER, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe observations now to be commenced are supposed to take place during\r\nthe second quarter of the year,--at ten o'clock on the 20th of April, or\r\nat nine on the 5th of May, or at eight on the 21st of May, or at seven\r\non the 5th of June, or at hours intermediate to these on intermediate\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nWe again look first for the Great Bear, now near the zenith, and thence\r\nfind the Pole-star. Turning towards the north, we see Cassiopeia between\r\nthe Pole-star and the horizon. Towards the north-west is the brilliant\r\nCapella, and towards the north-east the equally brilliant Vega, beneath\r\nwhich, and somewhat northerly, is the cross in Cygnus. The Milky Way\r\npasses from the eastern horizon towards the north (low down), and so\r\nround to the western horizon.\r\n\r\nIn selecting a region for special observation, we shall adopt a\r\ndifferent plan from that used in the preceding \"half-hour.\" The region\r\non the equator and towards the south is indeed particularly interesting,\r\nsince it includes the nebular region in Virgo. Within this space nebulæ\r\nare clustered more closely than over any corresponding space in the\r\nheavens, save only the greater Magellanic cloud. But to the observer\r\nwith telescopes of moderate power these nebulæ present few features of\r\nspecial interest; and there are regions of the sky now well situated for\r\nobservation, which, at most other epochs are either low down towards\r\nthe horizon or inconveniently near to the zenith. We shall therefore\r\nselect one of these, the region included in the second map of Plate 2,\r\nand the neighbouring part of the celestial sphere.\r\n\r\nAt any of the hours above named, the constellation Hercules lies towards\r\nthe east. A quadrant taken from the zenith to the eastern horizon passes\r\nclose to the last star ([eta]) of the Great Bear's tail, through [beta],\r\na star in Bootes' head, near [beta] Herculis, between the two \"Alphas\"\r\nwhich mark the heads of Hercules and Ophiuchus, and so past [beta]\r\nOphiuchi, a third-magnitude star near the horizon. And here we may turn\r\naside for a moment to notice the remarkable vertical row of six\r\nconspicuous stars towards the east-south-east; these are, counting them\r\nin order from the horizon, [zeta], [epsilon], and [delta] Ophiuchi,\r\n[epsilon], [alpha], and [delta] Serpentis.\r\n\r\nLet the telescope first be directed towards Vega. This orb presents a\r\nbrilliant appearance in the telescope. Its colour is a bluish-white. In\r\nan ordinary telescope Vega appears as a single star, but with a large\r\nobject-glass two distant small companions are seen. A nine-inch glass\r\nshows also two small companions within a few seconds of Vega. In the\r\ngreat Harvard refractor Vega is seen with no less than thirty-five\r\ncompanions. I imagine that all these stars, and others which can be seen\r\nin neighbouring fields, indicate the association of Vega with the\r\nneighbouring stream of the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nLet our observer now direct his telescope to the star [epsilon] Lyræ. Or\r\nrather, let him first closely examine this star with the naked eye. The\r\nstar is easily identified, since it lies to the left of Vega, forming\r\nwith [zeta] a small equilateral triangle. A careful scrutiny suffices to\r\nindicate a peculiarity in this star. If our observer possesses very\r\ngood eye-sight, he will distinctly recognise it as a \"naked-eye double\";\r\nbut more probably he will only notice that it appears lengthened in a\r\nnorth and south direction.[4] In the finder the star is easily divided.\r\nApplying a low power to the telescope itself, we see [epsilon] Lyræ as a\r\nwide double, the line joining the components lying nearly north and\r\nsouth. The southernmost component (the upper in the figure) is called\r\n[epsilon]^{1}, the other [epsilon]^{2}. Seen as a double, both\r\ncomponents appear white.\r\n\r\nNow, if the observer's telescope is sufficiently powerful, each of the\r\ncomponents may be seen to be itself double. First try [epsilon]^{1}, the\r\nnorthern pair. The line joining the components is directed as shown in\r\nPlate 3. The distance between them is 3\"·2, their magnitudes 5 and\r\n6-1/2, and their colours yellow and ruddy. If the observer succeeds in\r\nseeing [epsilon]^{1} fairly divided, he will probably not fail in\r\ndetecting the duplicity of [epsilon]^{2}, though this is a rather closer\r\npair, the distance between the components being only 2\"·6. The\r\nmagnitudes are 5 and 5-1/2, both being white. Between [epsilon]^{1} and\r\n[epsilon]^{2} are three faint stars, possibly forming with the quadruple\r\na single system.\r\n\r\nLet us next turn to the third star of the equilateral triangle mentioned\r\nabove--viz. to the star [zeta] Lyræ. This is a splendid but easy double.\r\nIt is figured in Plate 3, but it must be noticed that the figure of\r\n[zeta] and the other nine small figures are not drawn on the same scale\r\nas [epsilon] Lyræ. The actual distance between the components of [zeta]\r\nLyra is 44\", or about one-fourth of the distance separating\r\n[epsilon]^{1} from [epsilon]^{2}. The components of [zeta] are very\r\nnearly equal in magnitude, in colour topaz and green, the topaz\r\ncomponent being estimated as of the fifth magnitude, the green component\r\nintermediate between the fifth and sixth magnitudes.\r\n\r\nWe may now turn to a star not figured in the map, but readily found. It\r\nwill be noticed that the stars [epsilon], [alpha], [beta], and [gamma]\r\nform, with two small stars towards the left, a somewhat regular\r\nhexagonal figure--a hexagon, in fact, having three equal long sides and\r\nthree nearly equal short sides alternating with the others. The star\r\n[eta] Lyræ forms the angle next to [epsilon]. It is a wide and unequal\r\ndouble, as figured in Plate 3. The larger component is azure blue; the\r\nsmaller is violet, and, being only of the ninth magnitude, is somewhat\r\ndifficult to catch with apertures under 3 inches.\r\n\r\nThe star [delta]^{2} Lyræ is orange, [delta]^{1} blue. In the same field\r\nwith these are seen many other stars.\r\n\r\nThe stars [gamma]^{1} and [gamma]^{2} may also be seen in a single\r\nfield, the distance between them being about half the moon's mean\r\ndiameter. The former is quadruple, the components being yellow, bluish,\r\npale blue, and blue.\r\n\r\nTurn next to the stars [beta] and [gamma] Lyræ, the former a multiple,\r\nthe latter an unequal double star. It is not, however, in these respects\r\nthat these stars are chiefly interesting, but for their variability. The\r\nvariability of [gamma] has not indeed been fully established, though it\r\nis certain that, having once been less bright, [gamma] is now\r\nconsiderably brighter than [beta]. The change, however, may be due to\r\nthe variation of [beta] alone. This star is one of the most remarkable\r\nvariables known. Its period is 12d. 21h. 53m. 10s. In this time it\r\npasses from a maximum brilliancy--that of a star of the 3·4\r\nmagnitude--to a minimum lustre equal to that of a star of the 4·3\r\nmagnitude, thence to the same maximum brilliancy as before, thence to\r\nanother minimum of lustre--that of a star of the 4·5 magnitude--and so\r\nto its maximum lustre again, when the cycle of changes recommences.\r\nThese remarkable changes seem to point to the existence of two unequal\r\ndark satellites, whose dimensions bear a much greater proportion to\r\nthose of the bright components of [beta] Lyræ than the dimensions of the\r\nmembers of the Solar System bear to those of the sun. In this case, at\r\nany rate, the conjecture hazarded about Algol, that the star revolves\r\naround a dark central orb, would be insufficient to account for the\r\nobserved variation.\r\n\r\nNearly midway between [beta] and [gamma] lies the wonderful ring-nebula\r\n57 M, of which an imperfect idea will be conveyed by the last figure of\r\nPlate 3. This nebula was discovered in 1772, by Darquier, at Toulouse.\r\nIt is seen as a ring of light with very moderate telescopic power. In a\r\ngood 3-1/2-inch telescope the nebula exhibits a mottled appearance and a\r\nsparkling light. Larger instruments exhibit a faint light within the\r\nring; and in Lord Rosse's great Telescope \"wisps of stars\" are seen\r\nwithin, and faint streaks of light stream from the outer border of the\r\nring. This nebula has been subjected to spectrum-analysis by Mr.\r\nHuggins. It turns out to be a gaseous nebula! In fact, ring-nebulæ--of\r\nwhich only seven have been detected--seem to belong to the same class as\r\nthe planetary nebulæ, all of which exhibit the line-spectrum indicative\r\nof gaseity. The brightest of the three lines seen in the spectrum of the\r\nring-nebula in Lyra presents a rather peculiar appearance, \"since it\r\nconsists,\" says Mr. Huggins, \"of two bright dots, corresponding to\r\nsections of the ring, and between these there is not darkness, but an\r\nexcessively faint line joining them. This observation makes it probable\r\nthat the faint nebulous matter occupying the central portion is similar\r\nin constitution to that of the ring.\"\r\n\r\nThe constellation Hercules also contains many very interesting objects.\r\nLet us first inspect a nebula presenting a remarkable contrast with that\r\njust described. I refer to the nebula 13 M, known as Halley's nebula\r\n(Plate 3). This nebula is visible to the naked eye, and in a good\r\ntelescope it is a most wonderful object: \"perhaps no one ever saw it for\r\nthe first time without uttering a shout of wonder.\" It requires a very\r\npowerful telescope completely to resolve this fine nebula, but the\r\noutlying streamers may be resolved with a good 3-inch telescope. Sir W.\r\nHerschel considered that the number of the stars composing this\r\nwonderful object was at least 14,000. The accepted views respecting\r\nnebulæ would place this and other clusters far beyond the limits of our\r\nsidereal system, and would make the component stars not very unequal (on\r\nthe average) to our own sun. It seems to me far more probable, on the\r\ncontrary, that the cluster belongs to our own system, and that its\r\ncomponents are very much smaller than the average of separate stars.\r\nPerhaps the whole mass of the cluster does not exceed that of an average\r\nfirst-magnitude star.\r\n\r\nThe nebulæ 92 M and 50 H may be found, after a little searching, from\r\nthe positions indicated in the map. They are both well worthy of study,\r\nthe former being a very bright globular cluster, the latter a bright and\r\nlarge round nebula. The spectra of these, as of the great cluster,\r\nresemble the solar spectrum, being continuous, though, of course, very\r\nmuch fainter.\r\n\r\nThe star [delta] Herculis (seen at the bottom of the map) is a wide and\r\neasy double--a beautiful object. The components, situated as shown in\r\nPlate 3, are of the fourth and eighth magnitude, and coloured\r\nrespectively greenish-white and grape-red.\r\n\r\nThe star [kappa] Herculis is not shown in the map, but may be very\r\nreadily found, lying between the two gammas, [gamma] Herculis and\r\n[gamma] Serpentis (_see_ Frontispiece, Map 2), rather nearer the latter.\r\nIt is a wide double, the components of fifth and seventh magnitude, the\r\nlarger yellowish-white, the smaller ruddy yellow.[5]\r\n\r\nRas Algethi, or [alpha] Herculis, is also beyond the limits of the map,\r\nbut may be easily found by means of Map 2, Frontispiece. It is, properly\r\nspeaking, a multiple star. Considered as a double, the arrangement of\r\nthe components is that shown in Plate 3. The larger is of magnitude\r\n3-1/2, the smaller of magnitude 5-1/2; the former orange, the latter\r\nemerald. The companion stars are small, and require a good telescope to\r\nbe well seen. Ras Algethi is a variable, changing from magnitude 3 to\r\nmagnitude 3-1/2 in a period of 66-1/3 days.\r\n\r\nThe star [rho] Herculis is a closer double. The components are 3\"·7\r\napart, and situated as shown in Plate 3. The larger is of magnitude 4,\r\nthe smaller 5-1/2; the former bluish-white, the latter pale emerald.\r\n\r\nThere are other objects within the range of our map which are well\r\nworthy of study. Such are [mu] Draconis, a beautiful miniature of\r\nCastor; [gamma]^{1} and [gamma]^{2} Draconis, a wide double, the\r\ndistance between the components being nearly 62\" (both grey); and\r\n[gamma]^{1} and [gamma]^{2} Coronæ, a naked-eye double, the components\r\nbeing 6' apart, and each double with a good 3-inch telescope.\r\n\r\nWe turn, however, to another region of the sky. Low down, towards the\r\nsouth is seen the small constellation Corvus, recognised by its\r\nirregular quadrilateral of stars. Of the two upper stars, the left-hand\r\none is Algorab, a wide double, the components placed as in Plate 3,\r\n23\"·5 apart, the larger of magnitude 3, the smaller 8-1/2, the colours\r\npale yellow and purple.\r\n\r\nThere is a red star in this neighbourhood which is well worth looking\r\nfor. To the right of Corvus is the constellation Crater, easily\r\nrecognised as forming a tolerably well-marked small group. The star\r\nAlkes, or [alpha] Crateris, must first be found. It is far from being\r\nthe brightest star in the constellation, and may be assumed to have\r\ndiminished considerably in brilliancy since it was entitled [alpha] by\r\nBayer. It will easily be found, however, by means of the observer's star\r\nmaps. If now the telescope be directed to Alkes, there will be found,\r\nfollowing him at a distance of 42·5 s, and about one minute southerly, a\r\nsmall red star, R. Crateris. Like most red stars, this one is a\r\nvariable. A somewhat smaller blue star may be seen in the same field.\r\n\r\nThere is another red star which may be found pretty easily at this\r\nseason. First find the stars [eta] and [omicron] Leonis, the former\r\nforming with Regulus (now lying towards the south-west, and almost\r\nexactly midway between the zenith and the horizon) the handle of the\r\nSickle in Leo, the other farther off from Regulus towards the right, but\r\nlower down. Now sweep from [omicron] towards [eta] with a low power.[6]\r\nThere will be found a sixth-magnitude star about one-fourth of the way\r\nfrom [omicron] to [eta]. South, following this, will be found a group of\r\nfour stars, of which one is crimson. This is the star R Leonis. Like R\r\nCrateris and R Leporis it is variable.\r\n\r\nNext, let the observer turn towards the south again. Above Corvus, in\r\nthe position shown in the Frontispiece, there are to be seen five stars,\r\nforming a sort of wide V with somewhat bowed legs. At the angle is the\r\nstar [gamma] Virginis, a noted double. In 1756 the components were 6-1/2\r\nseconds apart. They gradually approached till, in 1836, they could not\r\nbe separated by the largest telescopes. Since then they have been\r\nseparating, and they are now 4-1/2 seconds apart, situated as shown in\r\nPlate 3. They are nearly equal in magnitude (4), and both pale yellow.\r\n\r\nThe star [gamma] Leonis is a closer and more beautiful double. It will\r\nbe found above Regulus, and is the brightest star on the blade of the\r\nSickle. The components are separated by about 3-1/5 seconds, the larger\r\nof the second, the smaller of the fourth magnitude; the former\r\nyellow-orange, the latter greenish-yellow.\r\n\r\nLastly, the star [iota] Leonis may be tried. It will be a pretty severe\r\ntest for our observer's telescope, the components being only 2\"·4 apart,\r\nand the smaller scarcely exceeding the eighth magnitude. The brighter\r\n(fourth magnitude) is pale yellow, the other light blue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nA HALF-HOUR WITH BOOTES, SCORPIO, OPHIUCHUS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now commence a series of observations suited to the third quarter of\r\nthe year, and to the following hours:--Ten o'clock on the 22nd of July;\r\nnine on the 8th of August; eight on the 23rd of August; seven on the 8th\r\nof October; and intermediate hours on days intermediate to these.\r\n\r\nWe look first for the Great Bear towards the north-west, and thence find\r\nthe Pole-star. Turning towards the north we see Capella and [beta]\r\nAurigæ low down and slightly towards the left of the exact north point.\r\nThe Milky Way crosses the horizon towards the north-north-east and\r\npasses to the opposite point of the compass, attaining its highest point\r\nabove the horizon towards east-south-east. This part of the Milky Way is\r\nwell worth observing, being marked by singular variations of brilliancy.\r\nNear Arided (the principal star of Cygnus, and now lying due east--some\r\ntwenty-five degrees from the zenith) there is seen a straight dark rift,\r\nand near this space is another larger cavity, which has been termed the\r\nnorthern Coal-sack. The space between [gamma], [delta], and [beta] Cygni\r\nis covered by a large oval mass, exceedingly rich and brilliant. The\r\nneighbouring branch, extending from [epsilon] Cygni, is far less\r\nconspicuous here, but near Sagitta becomes brighter than the other,\r\nwhich in this neighbourhood suddenly loses its brilliancy and fading\r\ngradually beyond this point becomes invisible near [beta] Ophiuchi.\r\nThe continuous stream becomes patchy--in parts very brilliant--where it\r\ncrosses Aquila and Clypeus. In this neighbourhood the other stream\r\nreappears, passing over a region very rich in stars. We see now the\r\ngreatest extent of the Milky Way, towards this part of its length, ever\r\nvisible in our latitudes--just as in spring we see its greatest extent\r\ntowards Monoceros and Argo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV.]\r\n\r\nI may note here in passing that Sir John Herschel's delineation of the\r\nnorthern portion of the Milky Way, though a great improvement on the\r\nviews given in former works, seems to require revision, and especially\r\nas respects the very remarkable patches and streaks which characterise\r\nthe portion extending over Cepheus and Cygnus. It seems to me, also,\r\nthat the evidence on which it has been urged that the stars composing\r\nthe Milky Way are (on an average) comparable in magnitude to our own\r\nsun, or to stars of the leading magnitudes, is imperfect. I believe, for\r\ninstance, that the brilliant oval of milky light in Cygnus comes from\r\nstars intimately associated with the leading stars in that\r\nconstellation, and not far removed in space (proportionately) beyond\r\nthem. Of course, if this be the case, the stars, whose combined light\r\nforms the patch of milky light, must be far smaller than the leading\r\nbrilliants of Cygnus. However, this is not the place to enter on\r\nspeculations of this sort; I return therefore to the business we have\r\nmore immediately in hand.\r\n\r\nTowards the east is the square of Pegasus low down towards the horizon.\r\nTowards the south is Scorpio, distinguished by the red and brilliant\r\nAntares, and by a train of conspicuous stars. Towards the west is\r\nBootes, his leading brilliant--the ruddy Arcturus--lying somewhat nearer\r\nthe horizon than the zenith, and slightly south of west. Bootes as a\r\nconstellation is easily found if we remember that he is delineated as\r\nchasing away the Greater Bear. Thus at present he is seen in a slightly\r\ninclined position, his head (marked by the third-magnitude star [beta])\r\nlying due west, some thirty degrees from the zenith. It has always\r\nappeared to me, by the way, that Bootes originally had nobler\r\nproportions than astronomers now assign to him. It is known that Canes\r\nVenatici now occupy the place of an upraised arm of Bootes, and I\r\nimagine that Corona Borealis, though undoubtedly a very ancient\r\nconstellation, occupies the place of his other arm. Giving to the\r\nconstellation the extent thus implied, it exhibits (better than most\r\nconstellations) the character assigned to it. One can readily picture to\r\noneself the figure of a Herdsman with upraised arms driving Ursa Major\r\nbefore him. This view is confirmed, I think, by the fact that the Arabs\r\ncalled this constellation the Vociferator.\r\n\r\nBootes contains many beautiful objects. Partly on this account, and\r\npartly because this is a constellation with which the observer should be\r\nspecially familiar, a map of it is given in Plate 4.\r\n\r\nArcturus has a distant pale lilac companion, and is in other respects a\r\nremarkable and interesting object. It is of a ruddy yellow colour.\r\nSchmidt, indeed, considers that the star has changed colour of late\r\nyears, and that whereas it was once very red it is now a yellow star.\r\nThis opinion does not seem well grounded, however. The star _may_ have\r\nbeen more ruddy once than now, though no other observer has noticed such\r\na peculiarity; but it is certainly not a pure yellow star at present (at\r\nany rate as seen in our latitude). Owing probably to the difference of\r\ncolour between Vega, Capella and Arcturus, photometricians have not been\r\nperfectly agreed as to the relative brilliancy of these objects. Some\r\nconsider Vega the most brilliant star in the northern heavens, while\r\nothers assign the superiority to Capella. The majority, however,\r\nconsider Arcturus the leading northern brilliant, and in the whole\r\nheavens place three only before him, viz., Sirius, Canopus, and [alpha]\r\nCentauri. Arcturus is remarkable in other respects. His proper motion is\r\nvery considerable, so great in fact that since the time of Ptolemy the\r\nsoutherly motion (alone) of Arcturus has carried him over a space nearly\r\nhalf as great again as the moon's apparent diameter. One might expect\r\nthat so brilliant a star, apparently travelling at a rate so great\r\ncompared with the average proper motions of the stars, must be\r\ncomparatively near to us. This, however, has not been found to be the\r\ncase. Arcturus is, indeed, one of the stars whose distance it has been\r\nfound possible to estimate roughly. But he is found to be some three\r\ntimes as far from us as the small star 61 Cygni, and more than seven\r\ntimes as far from us as [alpha] Centauri.\r\n\r\nThe star [delta] Bootis is a wide and unequal double, the smaller\r\ncomponent being only of the ninth magnitude.\r\n\r\nAbove Alkaid the last star in the tail of the Greater Bear, there will\r\nbe noticed three small stars. These are [theta], [iota], and [kappa]\r\nBootis, and are usually placed in star-maps near the upraised hand of\r\nthe Herdsman. The two which lie next to Alkaid, [iota] and [kappa], are\r\ninteresting doubles. The former is a wide double (see Plate 5), the\r\nmagnitudes of components 4 and 8, their colours yellow and white. The\r\nlarger star of this pair is itself double. The star [kappa] Bootis is\r\nnot so wide a double (see Plate 5), the magnitudes of the components 5\r\nand 8, their colours white and faint blue--a beautiful object.\r\n\r\nThe star [xi] Bootis is an exceedingly interesting object. It is\r\ndouble, the colours of the components being orange-yellow and ruddy\r\npurple, their magnitudes 3-1/2 and 6-1/2. When this star was first\r\nobserved by Herschel in 1780 the position of the components was quite\r\ndifferent from that presented in Plate 5. They were also much closer,\r\nbeing separated by a distance of less than 3-1/2 seconds. Since that\r\ntime the smaller component has traversed nearly a full quadrant, its\r\ndistance from its primary first increasing, till in 1831 the stars were\r\nnearly 7-1/2 seconds apart, and thence slowly diminishing, so that at\r\npresent the stars are less than 5 seconds apart. The period usually\r\nassigned to the revolution of this binary system is 117 years, and the\r\nperiod of peri-astral passage is said to be 1779. It appears to me,\r\nhowever, that the period should be about 108 years, the epoch of last\r\nperi-astral passage 1777 and of next peri-astral passage, therefore,\r\n1885. The angular motion of the secondary round the primary is now\r\nrapidly increasing, and the distance between the components is rapidly\r\ndiminishing, so that in a few years a powerful telescope will be\r\nrequired to separate the pair.\r\n\r\nNot far from [xi] is [pi] Bootis, represented in Plate 5 as a somewhat\r\ncloser double, but in reality--now at any rate--a slightly wider pair,\r\nsince the distance between the components of [xi] has greatly diminished\r\nof late. Both the components of [pi] are white, and their magnitudes are\r\n3-1/2 and 6.\r\n\r\nWe shall next turn to an exceedingly beautiful and delicate object, the\r\ndouble star [epsilon] Bootis, known also as Mirac and, on account of its\r\nextreme beauty, called Pulcherrima by Admiral Smyth. The components of\r\nthis beautiful double are of the third and seventh magnitude, the\r\nprimary orange, the secondary sea-green. The distance separating the\r\ncomponents is about 3 seconds, perhaps more; it appears to have been\r\nslowly increasing during the past ten or twelve years. Smyth assigns to\r\nthis system a period of revolution of 980 years, but there can be little\r\ndoubt that the true period is largely in excess of this estimate.\r\nObservers in southern latitudes consider that the colours of the\r\ncomponents are yellow and blue, not orange and green as most of our\r\nnorthern observers have estimated them.\r\n\r\nA little beyond the lower left-hand corner of the map is the star\r\n[delta] Serpentis, in the position shown in the Frontispiece, Map 3.\r\nThis is the star which at the hour and season depicted in Map 2 formed\r\nthe uppermost of a vertical row of stars, which has now assumed an\r\nalmost horizontal position. The components of [delta] Serpentis are\r\nabout 3-1/2 seconds apart, their magnitudes 3 and 5, both white.\r\n\r\nThe stars [theta]^{1} and [theta]^{2} Serpentis form a wide double, the\r\ndistance between the components being 21-1/2 seconds. They are nearly\r\nequal in magnitude, the primary being 4-1/2, the secondary 5. Both are\r\nyellow, the primary being of a paler yellow colour than the smaller\r\nstar. But the observer may not know where to look for [theta] Serpentis,\r\nsince it falls in a part of the constellation quite separated from that\r\npart in which [delta] Serpentis lies. In fact [theta] lies on the\r\nextreme easterly verge of the eastern half of the constellation. It is\r\nto be looked for at about the same elevation as the brilliant Altair,\r\nand (as to azimuth) about midway between Altair and the south.\r\n\r\nThe stars [alpha]^{1} and [alpha]^{2} Libræ form a wide double, perhaps\r\njust separable by the naked eye in very favourable weather. The larger\r\ncomponent is of the third, the smaller of the sixth magnitude, the\r\nformer yellow the latter light grey.\r\n\r\nThe star [beta] Libræ is a beautiful light-green star to the naked eye;\r\nin the telescope a wide double, pale emerald and light blue.\r\n\r\nIn Scorpio there are several very beautiful objects:--\r\n\r\nThe star Antares or Cor Scorpionis is one of the most beautiful of the\r\nred stars. It has been termed the Sirius of red stars, a term better\r\nmerited perhaps by Aldebaran, save for this that, in our latitude,\r\nAntares is, like Sirius, always seen as a brilliant \"scintillator\"\r\n(because always low down), whereas Aldebaran rises high above the\r\nhorizon. Antares is a double star, its companion being a minute green\r\nstar. In southern latitudes the companion of Antares may be seen with a\r\ngood 4-inch, but in our latitudes a larger opening is wanted. Mr. Dawes\r\nonce saw the companion of Antares shining alone for seven seconds, the\r\nprimary being hidden by the moon. He found that the colour of the\r\nsecondary is not merely the effect of contrast, but that this small star\r\nis really a green sun.\r\n\r\nThe star [beta] Scorpionis is a fine double, the components 13\"·1 apart,\r\ntheir magnitudes 2 and 5-1/2, colours white and lilac. It has been\r\nsupposed that this pair is only an optical double, but a long time must\r\nelapse before a decisive opinion can be pronounced on such a point.\r\n\r\nThe star [sigma] Scorpionis is a wider but much more difficult double,\r\nthe smaller component being below the 9th magnitude. The colour of the\r\nprimary (4) is white, that of the secondary maroon.\r\n\r\nThe star [xi] Scorpionis is a neat double, the components 7\"·2 apart,\r\ntheir magnitudes 4-1/2 and 7-1/2, their colours white and grey. This\r\nstar is really triple, a fifth-magnitude star lying close to the\r\nprimary.\r\n\r\nIn Ophiuchus, a constellation covering a wide space immediately above\r\nScorpio, there are several fine doubles. Among others--\r\n\r\n39 Ophiuchi, distance between components 12\"·1, their magnitudes 5-1/2\r\nand 7-1/2, their colours orange and blue.\r\n\r\nThe star 70 Ophiuchi, a fourth-magnitude star on the right shoulder of\r\nOphiuchus, is a noted double. The distance between the components about\r\n5-1/2\", their magnitudes 4-1/2 and 7, the colours yellow and red. The\r\npair form a system whose period of revolution is about 95 years.\r\n\r\n36 Ophiuchi (variable), distance 5\"·2, magnitudes 4-1/2 and 6-1/2,\r\ncolours red and yellow.\r\n\r\n[rho] Opiuchi, distance 4\", colours yellow and blue, magnitudes 5 and 7.\r\n\r\nBetween [alpha] and [beta] Scorpionis the fine nebula 80 M may be looked\r\nfor. (Or more closely thus:--below [beta] is the wide Double [omega]^{1}\r\nand [omega]^{2} Scorpionis; about as far to the right of Antares is the\r\nstar [sigma] Scorpionis, and immediately above this is the\r\nfifth-magnitude star 19.) The nebula we seek lies between 19 and\r\n[omega], nearer to 19 (about two-fifths of the way towards [omega]).\r\nThis nebula is described by Sir W. Herschel as \"the richest and most\r\ncondensed mass of stars which the firmament offers to the contemplation\r\nof astronomers.\"\r\n\r\nThere are two other objects conveniently situated for observation, which\r\nthe observer may now turn to. The first is the great cluster in the\r\nsword-hand of Perseus (see Plate 4), now lying about 28° above the\r\nhorizon between N.E. and N.N.E. The stars [gamma] and [delta] Cassiopeiæ\r\n(see Map 3 of Frontispiece) point towards this cluster, which is rather\r\nfarther from [delta] than [delta] from [gamma], and a little south of\r\nthe produced line from these stars. The cluster is well seen with the\r\nnaked eye, even in nearly full moonlight. In a telescope of moderate\r\npower this cluster is a magnificent object, and no telescope has yet\r\nrevealed its full glory. The view in Plate 5 gives but the faintest\r\nconception of the glories of [chi] Persei. Sir W. Herschel tried in\r\nvain to gauge the depths of this cluster with his most powerful\r\ntelescope. He spoke of the most distant parts as sending light to us\r\nwhich must have started 4000 or 5000 years ago. But it appears\r\nimprobable that the cluster has in reality so enormous a longitudinal\r\nextension compared with its transverse section as this view would imply.\r\nOn the contrary, I think we may gather from the appearance of this\r\ncluster, that stars are far less uniform in size than has been commonly\r\nsupposed, and that the mere irresolvability of a cluster is no proof of\r\nexcessive distance. It is unlikely that the faintest component of the\r\ncluster is farther off than the brightest (a seventh-magnitude star) in\r\nthe proportion of more than about 20 to 19, while the ordinary estimate\r\nof star magnitudes, applied by Herschel, gave a proportion of 20 or 30\r\nto 1 at least. I can no more believe that the components of this cluster\r\nare stars greatly varying in distance, but accidentally seen in nearly\r\nthe same direction, (or that they form an _enormously long system_\r\nturned by accident directly towards the earth), than I could look on the\r\nassociation of several thousand persons in the form of a procession as a\r\nfortuitous arrangement.\r\n\r\nNext there is the great nebula in Andromeda--known as \"the\r\ntranscendantly beautiful queen of the nebulæ.\" It will not be difficult\r\nto find this object. The stars [epsilon] and [delta] Cassiopeiæ (Map 3,\r\nFrontispiece) point to the star [beta] Andromedæ. Almost in a vertical\r\nline above this star are two fourth-magnitude stars [mu] and [gamma],\r\nand close above [nu], a little to the right, is the object we\r\nseek--visible to the naked eye as a faint misty spot. To tell the truth,\r\nthe transcendantly beautiful queen of the nebulæ is rather a\r\ndisappointing object in an ordinary telescope. There is seen a long\r\noval or lenticular spot of light, very bright near the centre,\r\nespecially with low powers. But there is a want of the interest\r\nattaching to the strange figure of the Great Orion nebula. The Andromeda\r\nnebula has been partially resolved by Lord Rosse's great reflector, and\r\n(it is said) more satisfactorily by the great refractor of Harvard\r\nCollege. In the spectroscope, Mr. Huggins informs us, the spectrum is\r\npeculiar. Continuous from the blue to the orange, the light there\r\n\"appears to cease very abruptly;\" there is no indication of gaseity.\r\n\r\nLastly, the observer may turn to the pair Mizar and Alcor, the former\r\nthe middle star in the Great Bear's tail, the latter 15' off. It seems\r\nquite clear, by the way, that Alcor has increased in brilliancy of late,\r\nsince among the Arabians it was considered an evidence of very good\r\neyesight to detect Alcor, whereas this star may now be easily seen even\r\nin nearly full moonlight. Mizar is a double star, and a fourth star is\r\nseen in the same field of view with the others (see Plate 5). The\r\ndistance between Mizar and its companion is 14\"·4; the magnitude of\r\nMizar 3, of the companion 5; their colours white and pale green,\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nA HALF-HOUR WITH ANDROMEDA, CYGNUS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur last half-hour with the double stars, &c., must be a short one, as\r\nwe have already nearly filled the space allotted to these objects. The\r\nobservations now to be made are supposed to take place during the fourth\r\nquarter of the year,--at ten o'clock on October 23rd; or at nine on\r\nNovember 7th; or at eight on November 22nd; or at seven on December 6th;\r\nor at hours intermediate to these on intermediate days.\r\n\r\nWe look first, as in former cases, for the Great Bear, now lying low\r\ndown towards the north. Towards the north-east, a few degrees easterly,\r\nare the twin-stars Castor and Pollux, in a vertical position, Castor\r\nuppermost. Above these, a little towards the right, we see the brilliant\r\nCapella; and between Capella and the zenith is seen the festoon of\r\nPerseus. Cassiopeia lies near the zenith, towards the north, and the\r\nMilky Way extends from the eastern horizon across the zenith to the\r\nwestern horizon. Low down in the east is Orion, half risen above\r\nhorizon. Turning to the south, we see high up above the horizon the\r\nsquare of Pegasus. Low down towards the south-south-west is Fomalhaut,\r\npointed to by [beta] and [alpha] Pegasi. Towards the west, about\r\nhalf-way between the zenith and the horizon, is the noble cross in\r\nCygnus; below which, towards the left, we see Altair, and his companions\r\n[beta] and [gamma] Aquilæ: while towards the right we see the brilliant\r\nVega.\r\n\r\nDuring this half-hour we shall not confine ourselves to any particular\r\nregion of the heavens, but sweep the most conveniently situated\r\nconstellations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V.]\r\n\r\nFirst, however, we should recommend the observer to try and get a good\r\nview of the great nebula in Andromeda, which is _not_ conveniently\r\nsituated for observation, but is so high that after a little trouble the\r\nobserver may expect a more distinct view than in the previous quarter.\r\nHe will see [beta] Andromedæ towards the south-east, about 18° from the\r\nzenith, [mu] and [nu] nearly in a line towards the zenith, and the\r\nnebula about half-way between [beta] and the zenith.\r\n\r\nWith a similar object it will be well to take another view of the great\r\ncluster in Perseus, about 18° from the zenith towards the\r\neast-north-east (_see_ the pointers [gamma] and [delta] Cassiopeiæ in\r\nMap 4, Frontispiece), the cluster being between [delta] Cassiopeiæ and\r\n[alpha] Persei.\r\n\r\nNot very far off is the wonderful variable Algol, now due east, and\r\nabout 58° above the horizon. The variability of this celebrated object\r\nwas doubtless discovered in very ancient times, since the name Al-gol,\r\nor \"the Demon\" seems to point to a knowledge of the peculiarity of this\r\n\"slowly winking eye.\" To Goodricke, however, is due the rediscovery of\r\nAlgol's variability. The period of variation is 2d. 20h. 48m.; during\r\n2h. 14m. Algol appears of the second magnitude; the remaining 6-3/4\r\nhours are occupied by the gradual decline of the star to the fourth\r\nmagnitude, and its equally gradual return to the second. It will be\r\nfound easy to watch the variations of this singular object, though, of\r\ncourse, many of the minima are attained in the daytime. The following\r\nmay help the observer:--\r\n\r\nOn October 8th, 1867, at about half-past eleven in the evening, I\r\nnoticed that Algol had reached its minimum of brilliancy. Hence the next\r\nminimum was attained at about a quarter-past eight on the evening of\r\nOctober 11th; the next at about five on the evening of October 14th,\r\nand so on. Now, if this process be carried on, it will be found that the\r\nnext evening minimum occurred at about 10h. (_circiter_) on the evening\r\nof October 31st, the next at about 11h. 30m. on the evening of November\r\n20th. Thus at whatever hour any minimum occurs, another occurs _six\r\nweeks and a day later_, at about the same hour. This would be exact\r\nenough if the period of variation were _exactly_ 2d. 20m. 48s., but the\r\nperiod is nearly a minute greater, and as there are fifteen periods in\r\nsix weeks and a day, it results that there is a difference of about 13m.\r\nin the time at which the successive recurrences at nearly the same hour\r\ntake place. Hence we are able to draw up the two following Tables, which\r\nwill suffice to give all the minima conveniently observable during the\r\nnext two years. Starting from a minimum at about 11h. 45m. on November\r\n20th, 1867, and noticing that the next 43-day period (with the 13m.\r\nadded) gives us an observation at midnight on January 2nd, 1868, and\r\nthat successive periods would make the hour later yet, we take the\r\nminimum next after that of January 2nd, viz. that of January 5th, 1868,\r\n8h. 48m., and taking 43-day periods (with 13m. added to each), we get\r\nthe series--\r\n\r\n                 h.  m.\r\nJan.   5, 1868,   8  45 P.M.\r\nFeb.  17, ----,   8  58 ----\r\nMar.  31, ----,   9  11 ----\r\nMay   13, ----,   9  24 ----\r\nJune  25, ----,   9  37 ----\r\nAug.   7, ----,   9  50 ----\r\nSept. 19, ----,  10   3 ----\r\nNov.   1  ----,  10  16 ----\r\nDec.  14, ----,  10  29 ----\r\nJan.  26, 1869,  10  42 ----\r\nMar.  10, ----,  10  25 ----\r\nMar.  13, ----,   7  43 ----[7]\r\nApr.  25, ----,   7  56 ----\r\nJune   7, ----,   8   9 ----\r\nJuly  20, ----,   8  22 ----\r\nSept.  1, ----,   8  35 ----\r\nOct.  14, ----,   8  48 ----\r\nNov.  26, ----,   9   1 ----\r\nJan.   8, 1870,   9  14 ----\r\nFeb.  20, ----,   9  27 ----\r\n\r\nFrom the minimum at about 10 P.M. on October 31st, 1867, we get in like\r\nmanner the series--\r\n\r\n                 h.  m.\r\nDec.  13, 1867,  10  13 P.M.\r\nJan.  25, 1868,  10  26 ----\r\nMar.   8, ----,  10  39 ----\r\nApr.  20, ----,  10  52 ----\r\nJune   2, ----,  11   5 ----\r\nJune   5, ----,   7  53 ----[8]\r\nJuly  18, ----,   8   6 ----\r\nAug.  30, ----,   8  19 ----\r\nOct.  12, ----,   8  32 ----\r\nNov.  24, ----,   8  45 ----\r\nJan.   6, 1869,   8  58 ----\r\nFeb.  18, ----,   9  11 ----\r\nApr.   2, ----,   9  24 ----\r\nMay   15, ----,   9  37 ----\r\nJune  27, ----,   9  50 ----\r\nAug.   9, ----,  10   3 ----\r\nSept. 21, ----,  10  16 ----\r\nNov.   3, ----,  10  29 ----\r\nDec.  16, ----,  10  42 ----\r\nJan.  28, 1870,  10  55 ----\r\n\r\nFrom one or other of these tables every observable minimum can be\r\nobtained. Thus, suppose the observer wants to look for a minimum during\r\nthe last fortnight in August, 1868. The first table gives him no\r\ninformation, the latter gives him a minimum at 8h. 19m. P.M. on August\r\n30; hence of course there is a minimum at 11h. 31m. P.M. on August 27;\r\nand there are no other conveniently observable minima during the\r\nfortnight in question.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the remarkable variation in this star's brilliancy has been\r\nassigned by some astronomers to the presence of an opaque secondary,\r\nwhich transits Algol at regular intervals; others have adopted the view\r\nthat Algol is a luminous secondary, revolving around an opaque primary.\r\nOf these views the former seems the most natural and satisfactory. It\r\npoints to a secondary whose mass bears a far greater proportion to that\r\nof the primary, than the mass even of Jupiter bears to the sun; the\r\nshortness of the period is also remarkable. It may be noticed that\r\nobservation points to a gradual diminution in the period of Algol's\r\nvariation, and the diminution seems to be proceeding more and more\r\nrapidly. Hence (assuming the existence of a dark secondary) we must\r\nsuppose that either it travels in a resisting medium which is gradually\r\ndestroying its motion, or that there are other dependent orbs whose\r\nattractions affect the period of this secondary. In the latter case the\r\ndecrease in the period will attain a limit and be followed by an\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\nHowever, interesting as the subject may be, it is a digression from\r\ntelescopic work, to which we now return.\r\n\r\nWithin the confines of the second map in Plate 4 is seen the fine star\r\n[gamma] Andromedæ. At the hour of our observations it lies high up\r\ntowards E.S.E. It is seen as a double star with very moderate telescopic\r\npower, the distance between the components being upwards of 10\"; their\r\nmagnitudes 3 and 5-1/2, their colours orange and green. Perhaps there is\r\nno more interesting double visible with low powers. The smaller star is\r\nagain double in first-class telescopes, the components being yellow and\r\nblue according to some observers, but according to others, both green.\r\n\r\nBelow [gamma] Andromedæ lie the stars [beta] and [gamma] Triangulorum,\r\n[gamma] a fine naked-eye triple (the companions being [delta] and [eta]\r\nTriangulorum), a fine object with a very low power. To the right is\r\n[alpha] Triangulorum, certainly less brilliant than [beta]. Below\r\n[alpha] are the three stars [alpha], [beta], and [gamma] Arietis, the\r\nfirst an unequal and difficult double, the companion being purple, and\r\nonly just visible (under favourable circumstances) with a good 3-inch\r\ntelescope; the last an easy double, interesting as being the first ever\r\ndiscovered (by Hook, in 1664), the colours of components white and grey.\r\n\r\nImmediately below [alpha] Arietis is the star [alpha] Ceti, towards the\r\nright of which (a little lower) is Mira, a wonderful variable. This star\r\nhas a period of 331-1/3 days; during a fortnight it appears as a star of\r\nthe 2nd magnitude,--on each side of this fortnight there is a period of\r\nthree months during one of which the star is increasing, while during\r\nthe other it is diminishing in brightness: during the remaining five\r\nmonths of the period the star is invisible to the naked eye. There are\r\nmany peculiarities and changes in the variation of this star, into which\r\nspace will not permit me to enter.\r\n\r\nImmediately above Mira is the star [alpha] Piscium at the knot of the\r\nFishes' connecting band. This is a fine double, the distance between the\r\ncomponents being about 3-1/2\", their magnitudes 5 and 6, their colours\r\npale green and blue (see Plate 5).\r\n\r\nClose to [gamma] Aquarii (see Frontispiece, Map 4), above and to the\r\nleft of it, is the interesting double [zeta] Aquarii; the distance\r\nbetween the components is about 3-1/2\", their magnitudes 4 and 4-1/2,\r\nboth whitish yellow. The period of this binary seems to be about 750\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nTurning next towards the south-west we see the second-magnitude star\r\n[epsilon] Pegasi, some 40° above the horizon. This star is a wide but\r\nnot easy double, the secondary being only of the ninth magnitude; its\r\ncolour is lilac, that of the primary being yellow.\r\n\r\nTowards the right of [epsilon] Pegasi and lower down are seen the three\r\nfourth-magnitude stars which mark the constellation Equuleus. Of these\r\nthe lowest is [alpha], to the right of which lies [epsilon] Equulei, a\r\nfifth-magnitude star, really triple, but seen as a double star with\r\nordinary telescopes (Plate 5). The distance between the components is\r\nnearly 11\", their colours white and blue, their magnitudes 5-1/2 and\r\n7-1/2. The primary is a very close double, which appears, however, to be\r\nopening out rather rapidly.\r\n\r\nImmediately below Equuleus are the stars [alpha]^{1} and [alpha]^2\r\nCapricorni, seen as a naked-eye double to the right of and above [beta].\r\nBoth [alpha]^1 and [alpha]^2 are yellow; [alpha]^2 is of the 3rd,\r\n[alpha]^1 of the 4th magnitude; in a good telescope five stars are seen,\r\nthe other three being blue, ash-coloured, and lilac. The star [beta]\r\nCapricorni is also a wide double, the components yellow and blue, with\r\nmany telescopic companions.\r\n\r\nTo the right of Equuleus, towards the west-south-west is the\r\nconstellation Delphinus. The upper left-hand star of the rhombus of\r\nstars forming the head of the Delphinus is the star [gamma] Delphini, a\r\nrather easy double (see Plate 5), the components being nearly 12\" apart,\r\ntheir magnitudes 4 and 7, their colours golden yellow and flushed grey.\r\n\r\nTurn we next to the charming double Albireo, on the beak of Cygnus,\r\nabout 36° above the horizon towards the west. The components are 34-1/2\"\r\napart, their magnitudes 3 and 6, their colours orange-yellow, and blue.\r\nIt has been supposed (perhaps on insufficient evidence) that this star\r\nis merely an optical double. It must always be remembered that a certain\r\nproportion of stars (amongst those separated by so considerable a\r\ndistance) _must_ be optically combined only.\r\n\r\nThe star [chi] Cygni is a wide double (variable) star. The components\r\nare separated by nearly 26\", their magnitudes 5 and 9, their colours\r\nyellow and light blue. [chi] may be found by noticing that there is a\r\ncluster of small stars in the middle of the triangle formed by the stars\r\n[gamma], [delta], and [beta] Cygni (see Map 4, Frontispiece), and that\r\n[chi] is the nearest star _of the cluster_ to [beta]. The star [phi]\r\nCygni, which is just above and very close to [beta] (Albireo), does not\r\nbelong to the cluster. [chi] is about half as far again from [phi] as\r\n[phi] from Albireo. But as [chi] descends to the 11th magnitude at its\r\nminimum the observer must not always expect to find it very easily. It\r\nhas been known to be invisible at the epoch when it should have been\r\nmost conspicuous. The period of this variable is 406 days.\r\n\r\nThe star 61 Cygni is an interesting one. So far as observation has yet\r\nextended, it would seem to be the nearest to us of all stars visible in\r\nthe northern hemisphere. It is a fine double, the components nearly\r\nequal (5-1/2 and 6), both yellow, and nearly 19\" apart. The period of\r\nthis binary appears to be about 540 years. To find 61 Cygni note that\r\n[epsilon] and [delta] Cygni form the diameter of a semicircle divided\r\ninto two quadrants by [alpha] Cygni (Arided). On this semicircle, on\r\neither side of [alpha], lie the stars [nu] and [alpha] Cygni, [nu]\r\ntowards [epsilon]. Now a line from [alpha] to [nu] produced passes very\r\nnear to 61 Cygni at a distance from [nu] somewhat greater than half the\r\ndistance of [nu] from [alpha].\r\n\r\nThe star [mu] Cygni lies in a corner of the constellation, rather\r\nfarther from [zeta] than [zeta] from [epsilon] Cygni. A line from\r\n[epsilon] to [zeta] produced meets [kappa] Pegasi, a fourth-magnitude\r\nstar; and [mu] Cygni, a fifth-magnitude star, lies close above [kappa]\r\nPegasi. The distance between the components is about 5-1/2\", their\r\nmagnitudes 5 and 6, their colours white and pale blue.\r\n\r\nThe star [psi] Cygni may next be looked for, but for this a good map of\r\nCygnus will be wanted, as [psi] is not pointed to by any well-marked\r\nstars. A line from [alpha], parallel to the line joining [gamma] and\r\n[delta], and about one-third longer than that line, would about mark the\r\nposition of [psi] Cygni. The distance between the components of this\r\ndouble is about 3-1/2\", their magnitudes 5-1/2 and 8, their colours\r\nwhite and lilac.\r\n\r\nLastly, the observer may turn to the stars [gamma]_{1} and [gamma]_{2}\r\nDraconis towards the north-west about 40° above the horizon (they are\r\nincluded in the second map of Plate 2). They form a wide double, having\r\nequal (fifth-magnitude) components, both grey. (See Plate 5.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nHALF-HOURS WITH THE PLANETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn observing the stars, we can select a part of the heavens which may be\r\nconveniently observed; and in this way in the course of a year we can\r\nobserve every part of the heavens visible in our northern hemisphere.\r\nBut with the planets the case is not quite so simple. They come into\r\nview at no fixed season of the year: some of them can never be seen _by\r\nnight_ on the meridian; and they all shift their place among the stars,\r\nso that we require some method of determining where to look for them on\r\nany particular night, and of recognising them from neighbouring fixed\r\nstars.\r\n\r\nThe regular observer will of course make use of the 'Nautical Almanac';\r\nbut 'Dietrichsen and Hannay's Almanac' will serve every purpose of the\r\namateur telescopist. I will briefly describe those parts of the almanac\r\nwhich are useful to the observer.\r\n\r\nIt will be found that three pages are assigned to each month, each page\r\ngiving different information. If we call these pages I. II. III., then\r\nin order that page I. for each month may fall to the left of the open\r\ndouble page, and also that I. and II. may be open together, the pages\r\nare arranged in the following order: I. II. III.; III. I. II.; I. II.\r\nIII.; and so on.\r\n\r\nNow page III. for any month does not concern the amateur observer. It\r\ngives information concerning the moon's motions, which is valuable to\r\nthe sailor, and interesting to the student of astronomy, but not\r\napplicable to amateur observation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI.]\r\n\r\nWe have then only pages I. and II. to consider:--\r\n\r\nAcross the top of both pages the right ascension and declination of the\r\nplanets Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Mercury, and Uranus are given,\r\naccompanied by those of two conspicuous stars. This information is very\r\nvaluable to the telescopist. In the first place, as we shall presently\r\nsee, it shows him what planets are well situated for observation, and\r\nsecondly it enables him to map down the path of any planet from day to\r\nday among the fixed stars. This is a very useful exercise, by the way,\r\nand also a very instructive one. The student may either make use of the\r\nregular maps and mark down the planet's path in pencil, taking a light\r\ncurve through the points given by the data in his almanac, or he may lay\r\ndown a set of meridians suited to the part of the heavens traversed by\r\nthe planet, and then proceed to mark in the planet's path and the stars,\r\ntaking the latter either from his maps or from a convenient list of\r\nstars.[9] My 'Handbook of the Stars' has been constructed to aid the\r\nstudent in these processes. It must be noticed that old maps are not\r\nsuited for the work, because, through precession, the stars are all out\r\nof place as respects R.A. and Dec. Even the Society's maps, constructed\r\nso as to be right for 1830, are beginning to be out of date. But a\r\nmatter of 20 or 30 years either way is not important.[10] My Maps,\r\nHandbook and Zodiac-chart have been constructed for the year 1880, so as\r\nto be serviceable for the next fifty years or so.\r\n\r\nNext, below the table of the planets, we have a set of vertical\r\ncolumns. These are, in order, the days of the month, the calendar--in\r\nwhich are included some astronomical notices, amongst others the\r\ndiameter of Saturn on different dates, the hours at which the sun rises\r\nand sets, the sun's right ascension, declination, diameter, and\r\nlongitude; then eight columns which do not concern the observer; after\r\nwhich come the hours at which the moon rises and sets, the moon's age;\r\nand lastly (so far as the observer is concerned) an important column\r\nabout Jupiter's system of satellites.\r\n\r\nNext, we have, at the foot of the first page, the hours at which the\r\nplanets rise, south, and set; and at the foot of the second page we have\r\nthe dates of conjunctions, oppositions, and of other phenomena, the\r\ndiameters of Venus, Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury, and finally a few words\r\nrespecting the visibility of these four planets.\r\n\r\nAfter the thirty-six pages assigned to the months follow four (pp.\r\n42-46) in which much important astronomical information is contained;\r\nbut the points which most concern our observer are (i.) a small table\r\nshowing the appearance of Saturn's rings, and (ii.) a table giving the\r\nhours at which Jupiter's satellites are occulted or eclipsed, re-appear,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nWe will now take the planets in the order of their distance from the\r\nsun: we shall see that the information given by the almanac is very\r\nimportant to the observer.\r\n\r\nMercury is so close to the sun as to be rarely seen with the naked eye,\r\nsince he never sets much more than two hours and a few minutes after the\r\nsun, or rises by more than that interval before the sun. It must not be\r\nsupposed that at each successive epoch of most favourable appearance\r\nMercury sets so long after the sun or rises so long before him. It would\r\noccupy too much of our space to enter into the circumstances which\r\naffect the length of these intervals. The question, in fact, is not a\r\nvery simple one. All the necessary information is given in the almanac.\r\nWe merely notice that the planet is most favourably seen as an evening\r\nstar in spring, and as a morning star in autumn.[11]\r\n\r\nThe observer with an equatorial has of course no difficulty in finding\r\nMercury, since he can at once direct his telescope to the proper point\r\nof the heavens. But the observer with an alt-azimuth might fail for\r\nyears together in obtaining a sight of this interesting planet, if he\r\ntrusted to unaided naked-eye observations in looking for him. Copernicus\r\nnever saw Mercury, though he often looked for him; and Mr. Hind tells me\r\nhe has seen the planet but once with the naked eye--though this perhaps\r\nis not a very remarkable circumstance, since the systematic worker in an\r\nobservatory seldom has occasion to observe objects with the unaided eye.\r\n\r\nBy the following method the observer can easily pick up the planet.\r\n\r\nAcross two uprights (Fig. 10) nail a straight rod, so that when looked\r\nat from some fixed point of view the rod may correspond to the sun's\r\npath near the time of observation. The rod should be at right-angles to\r\nthe line of sight to its centre. Fasten another rod at right angles to\r\nthe first. From the point at which the rods cross measure off and mark\r\non both rods spaces each subtending a degree as seen from the point of\r\nview. Thus, if the point of view is 9-1/2 feet off, these spaces must\r\neach be 2 inches long, and they must be proportionately less or greater\r\nas the eye is nearer or farther.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 10._]\r\n\r\nNow suppose the observer wishes to view Mercury on some day, whereon\r\nMercury is an evening star. Take, for instance, June 9th, 1868. We find\r\nfrom 'Dietrichsen' that on this day (at noon) Mercury's R.A. is 6h. 53m.\r\n23s.: and the sun's 5h. 11m. 31s. We need not trouble ourselves about\r\nthe odd hours after noon, and thus we have Mercury's R.A. greater than\r\nthe sun's by 1h. 41m. 52s. Now we will suppose that the observer has so\r\nfixed his uprights and the two rods, that the sun, seen from the fixed\r\npoint of view, appears to pass the point of crossing of the rods at\r\nhalf-past seven, then Mercury will pass the cross-rod at 11m. 52s. past\r\nnine. But where? To learn this we must take out Mercury's declination,\r\nwhich is 24° 43' 18\" N., and the sun's, which is 22° 59' 10\" N. The\r\ndifference, 1° 44' 8\" N. gives us Mercury's place, which it appears is\r\nrather less than 1-3/4 degree north of the sun. Thus, about 1h. 42m.\r\nafter the sun has passed the cross-rod, Mercury will pass it between the\r\nfirst and second divisions above the point of fastening. The sun will\r\nhave set about an hour, and Mercury will be easily found when the\r\ntelescope is directed towards the place indicated.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that this method does not require the time to be\r\nexactly known. All we have to do is to note the moment at which the sun\r\npasses the point of fastening of the two rods, and to take our 1h. 42m.\r\nfrom that moment.\r\n\r\nThis method, it may be noticed in passing, may be applied to give\r\nnaked-eye observations of Mercury at proper seasons (given in the\r\nalmanac). By a little ingenuity it may be applied as well to morning as\r\nto evening observations, the sun's passage of the cross-rod being taken\r\non one morning and Mercury's on the next, so many minutes _before_ the\r\nhour of the first observation. In this way several views of Mercury may\r\nbe obtained during the year.\r\n\r\nSuch methods may appear very insignificant to the systematic observer\r\nwith the equatorial, but that they are effective I can assert from my\r\nown experience. Similar methods may be applied to determine from the\r\nposition of a known object, that of any neighbouring unknown object even\r\nat night. The cross-rod must be shifted (or else two cross-rods used)\r\nwhen the unknown _precedes_ the known object. If two cross-rods are\r\nused, account must be taken of the gradual diminution in the length of a\r\ndegree of right ascension as we leave the equator.\r\n\r\nEven simpler methods carefully applied may serve to give a view of\r\nMercury. To show this, I may describe how I obtained my first view of\r\nthis planet. On June 1st, 1863, I noticed, that at five minutes past\r\nseven the sun, as seen from my study window, appeared from behind the\r\ngable-end of Mr. St. Aubyn's house at Stoke, Devon. I estimated the\r\neffect of Mercury's northerly declination (different of course for a\r\nvertical wall, than for the cross-rod in fig. 8, which, in fact, agrees\r\nwith a declination-circle), and found that he would pass out opposite a\r\nparticular point of the wall a certain time after the sun. I then turned\r\nthe telescope towards that point, and focussed for distinct vision of\r\ndistant objects, so that the outline of the house was seen out of focus.\r\nAs the calculated time of apparition approached, I moved the telescope\r\nup and down so that the field swept the neighbourhood of the estimated\r\npoint of apparition. I need hardly say that Mercury did not appear\r\nexactly at the assigned point, nor did I see him make his first\r\nappearance; but I picked him up so soon after emergence that the outline\r\nof the house was in the field of view with him. He appeared as a\r\nhalf-disc. I followed him with the telescope until the sun had set, and\r\nsoon after I was able to see him very distinctly with the naked eye. He\r\nshone with a peculiar brilliance on the still bright sky; but although\r\nperfectly distinct to the view when his place was indicated, he escaped\r\ndetection by the undirected eye.[12]\r\n\r\nMercury does not present any features of great interest in ordinary\r\ntelescopes; though he usually appears better defined than Venus, at\r\nleast as the latter is seen on a dark sky. The phases are pleasingly\r\nseen (as shown in Plate 6) with a telescope of moderate power. For their\r\nproper observation, however, the planet must be looked for with the\r\ntelescope in the manner above indicated, as he always shows a nearly\r\nsemi-circular disc when he is visible to the naked eye.\r\n\r\nWe come next to Venus, the most splendid of all the planets to the eye.\r\nIn the telescope Venus disappoints the observer, however. Her intense\r\nlustre brings out every defect of the instrument, and especially the\r\nchromatic aberration. A dark glass often improves the view, but not\r\nalways. Besides, an interposed glass has an unpleasant effect on the\r\nfield of view.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best method of observing Venus is to search for her when she\r\nis still high above the horizon, and when therefore the background of\r\nthe sky is bright enough to take off the planet's glare. The method I\r\nhave described for the observation of Mercury will prove very useful in\r\nthe search for Venus when the sun is above the horizon or but just set.\r\nOf course, when an object is to be looked for high above the horizon,\r\nthe two rods which support the cross-rods must not be upright, but\r\nsquare to the line of view to that part of the sky.\r\n\r\nBut the observer must not expect to see much during his observation of\r\nVenus. In fact, he can scarcely do more than note her varying phases\r\n(see Plate 6) and the somewhat uneven boundary of the terminator. Our\r\nleading observers have done so little with this fascinating but\r\ndisappointing planet, that amateurs must not be surprised at their own\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nI suppose the question whether Venus has a satellite, or at any rate\r\nwhether the object supposed to have been seen by Cassini and other old\r\nobservers were a satellite, must be considered as decided in the\r\nnegative. That Cassini should have seen an object which Dawes and Webb\r\nhave failed to see must be considered utterly improbable.\r\n\r\nLeaving the inferior planets, we come to a series of important and\r\ninteresting objects.\r\n\r\nFirst we have the planet Mars, nearly the last in the scale of planetary\r\nmagnitude, but far from being the least interesting of the planets. It\r\nis in fact quite certain that we obtain a better view of Mars than of\r\nany object in the heavens, save the Moon alone. He may present a less\r\ndistinguished appearance than Jupiter or Saturn, but we see his surface\r\non a larger scale than that of either of those giant orbs, even if we\r\nassume that we ever obtain a fair view of their real surface.\r\n\r\nNor need the moderately armed observer despair of obtaining interesting\r\nviews of Mars. The telescope with which Beer and Mädler made their\r\ncelebrated series of views was only a 4-inch one, so that with a 3-inch\r\nor even a 2-inch aperture the attentive observer may expect interesting\r\nviews. In fact, more depends on the observer than on the instrument. A\r\npatient and attentive scrutiny will reveal features which at the first\r\nview wholly escape notice.\r\n\r\nIn Plate 6 I have given a series of views of Mars much more distinct\r\nthan an observer may expect to obtain with moderate powers. I add a\r\nchart of Mars, a miniature of one I have prepared from a charming\r\nseries of tracings supplied me by Mr. Dawes. The views taken by this\r\ncelebrated observer in 1852, 1856, 1860, 1862, and 1864, are far better\r\nthan any others I have seen. The views by Beer and Mädler are good, as\r\nare some of Secchi's (though they appear badly drawn), Nasmyth's and\r\nPhillips'; Delarue's two views are also admirable; and Lockyer has given\r\na better set of views than any of the others. But there is an amount of\r\ndetail in Mr. Dawes' views which renders them superior to any yet taken.\r\nI must confess I failed at a first view to see the full value of Mr.\r\nDawes' tracings. Faint marks appeared, which I supposed to be merely\r\nintended to represent shadings scarcely seen. A more careful study\r\nshewed me that every mark is to be taken as the representative of what\r\nMr. Dawes actually saw. The consistency of the views is perfectly\r\nwonderful, when compared with the vagueness and inconsistency observable\r\nin nearly all other views. And this consistency is not shown by mere\r\nresemblance, which might have been an effect rather of memory\r\n(unconsciously exerted) than observation. The same feature changes so\r\nmuch in figure, as it appears on different parts of the disc, that it\r\nwas sometimes only on a careful projection of different views that I\r\ncould determine what certain features near the limb represented. But\r\nwhen this had been done, and the distortion through the effect of\r\nforeshortening corrected, the feature was found to be as true in shape\r\nas if it had been seen in the centre of the planet's disc.\r\n\r\nIn examining Mr. Dawes' drawings it was necessary that the position of\r\nMars' axis should be known. The data for determining this were taken\r\nfrom Dr. Oudemann's determinations given in a valuable paper on Mars\r\nissued from Mr. Bishop's observatory. But instead of calculating Mars'\r\npresentation by the formulæ there given, I found it convenient rather to\r\nmake use of geometrical constructions applied to my 'Charts of the\r\nTerrestrial Planets.' Taking Mädler's start-point for Martial\r\nlongitudes, that is the longitude-line passing near Dawes' forked bay, I\r\nfound that my results agreed pretty fairly with those in Prof. Phillips'\r\nmap, so far as the latter went; but there are many details in my charts\r\nnot found in Prof. Phillips' nor in Mädler's earlier charts.\r\n\r\nI have applied to the different features the names of those observers\r\nwho have studied the physical peculiarities presented by Mars. Mr.\r\nDawes' name naturally occurs more frequently than others. Indeed, if I\r\nhad followed the rule of giving to each feature the name of its\r\ndiscoverer, Mr. Dawes' name would have occurred much more frequently\r\nthan it actually does.\r\n\r\nOn account of the eccentricity of his orbit, Mars is seen much better in\r\nsome oppositions than in others. When best seen the southern hemisphere\r\nis brought more into view than the northern because the summer of his\r\nnorthern hemisphere occurs when he is nearly in aphelion (as is the case\r\nwith the Earth by the way).\r\n\r\nThe relative dimensions and presentation of Mars, as seen in opposition\r\nin perihelion, and in opposition in aphelion, are shown in the two rows\r\nof figures.\r\n\r\nIn and near quadrature Mars is perceptibly gibbous. He is seen thus\r\nabout two months before or after opposition. In the former case, he\r\nrises late and comes to the meridian six hours or so after midnight. In\r\nthe latter case, he is well seen in the evening, coming to the meridian\r\nat six. His appearance and relative dimensions as he passes from\r\nopposition to quadrature are shown in the last three figures of the\r\nupper row.\r\n\r\nMars' polar caps may be seen with very moderate powers.\r\n\r\nI add four sets of meridians (Plate 6), by filling in which from the\r\ncharts the observer may obtain any number of views of the planet as it\r\nappears at different times.\r\n\r\nPassing over the asteroids, which are not very interesting objects to\r\nthe amateur telescopist, we come to Jupiter, the giant of the solar\r\nsystem, surpassing our Earth more than 1400 times in volume, and\r\noverweighing all the planets taken together twice over.\r\n\r\nJupiter is one of the easiest of all objects of telescopic observation.\r\nNo one can mistake this orb when it shines on a dark sky, and only Venus\r\ncan be mistaken for it when seen as a morning or evening star. Sometimes\r\nboth are seen together on the twilight sky, and then Venus is generally\r\nthe brighter. Seen, however, at her brightest and at her greatest\r\nelongation from the sun, her splendour scarcely exceeds that with which\r\nJupiter shines when high above the southern horizon at midnight.\r\n\r\nJupiter's satellites may be seen with very low powers; indeed the outer\r\nones have been seen with the naked eye, and all are visible in a good\r\nopera-glass. Their dimensions relatively to the disc are shown in Plate\r\n7. Their greatest elongations are compared with the disc in the\r\nlow-power view.\r\n\r\nJupiter's belts may also be well seen with moderate telescopic power.\r\nThe outer parts of his disc are perceptibly less bright than the centre.\r\n\r\nMore difficult of observation are the transits of the satellites and of\r\ntheir shadows. Still the attentive observer can see the shadows with an\r\naperture of two inches, and the satellites themselves with an aperture\r\nof three inches.\r\n\r\nThe minute at which the satellites enter on the disc, or pass off, is\r\ngiven in 'Dietrichsen's Almanac.' The 'Nautical Almanac' also gives the\r\ncorresponding data for the shadows.\r\n\r\nThe eclipses of the satellites in Jupiter's shadow, and their\r\noccultations by his disc, are also given in 'Dietrichsen's Almanac.'\r\n\r\nIn the inverting telescope the satellites move from right to left in the\r\nnearer parts of their orbit, and therefore transit Jupiter's disc in\r\nthat direction, and from left to right in the farther parts. Also note\r\nthat _before_ opposition, (i.) the shadows travel in front of the\r\nsatellites in transiting the disc; (ii.) the satellites are eclipsed in\r\nJupiter's _shadow_; (iii.) they reappear from behind his _disc_. On the\r\nother hand, _after_ opposition, (i.) the shadows travel _behind_ the\r\nsatellites in transiting the disc; (ii.) the satellites are occulted by\r\nthe _disc_; (iii.) they reappear from eclipse in Jupiter's _shadow_.\r\n\r\nConjunctions of the satellites are common phenomena, and may be waited\r\nfor by the observer who sees the chance. An eclipse of one satellite by\r\nthe shadow of another is not a common phenomenon; in fact, I have never\r\nheard of such an eclipse being seen. That a satellite should be quite\r\nextinguished by another's shadow is a phenomenon not absolutely\r\nimpossible, but which cannot happen save at long intervals.\r\n\r\nThe shadows are not _black spots_ as is erroneously stated in nearly all\r\npopular works on astronomy. The shadow of the fourth, for instance, is\r\nnearly all penumbra, the really black part being quite minute by\r\ncomparison. The shadow of the third has a considerable penumbra, and\r\neven that of the first is not wholly black. These penumbras may not be\r\nperceptible, but they affect the appearance of the shadows. For\r\ninstance, the shadow of the fourth is perceptibly larger but less black\r\nthan that of the third, though the third is the larger satellite.\r\n\r\nIn transit the first satellite moves fastest, the fourth slowest, the\r\nothers in their order. The shadow moves just as fast (appreciably) as\r\nthe satellite it belongs to. Sometimes the shadow of the satellite may\r\nbe seen to overtake (apparently) the disc of another. In such a case the\r\nshadow does not pass over the disc, but the disc conceals the shadow.\r\nThis is explained by the fact that the shadow, if visible throughout its\r\nlength, would be a line reaching slantwise from the satellite it belongs\r\nto, and the end of the shadow (that is, the point where it meets the\r\ndisc) is _not_ the point where the shadow crosses the orbit of any inner\r\nsatellite. Thus the latter may be interposed between the end of the\r\nshadow--the only part of the shadow really visible--and the eye; but the\r\nend of the shadow _cannot_ be interposed between the satellite and the\r\neye. If a satellite _on the disc_ were eclipsed by another satellite,\r\nthe black spot thus formed would be in another place from the black spot\r\non the planet's body. I mention all this because, simple as the question\r\nmay seem, I have known careful observers to make mistakes on this\r\nsubject. A shadow is seen crossing the disc and overtaking, apparently,\r\na satellite in transit. It seems therefore, on a first view, that the\r\nshadow will hide the satellite, and observers have even said that they\r\nhave _seen_ this happen. But they are deceived. It is obvious that _if\r\none satellite eclipse another, the shadows of both must occupy the same\r\npoint on Jupiter's body_. Thus it is the overtaking of one _shadow_ by\r\nanother on the disc, and not the overtaking of a _satellite_ by a\r\nshadow, which determines the occurrence of that as yet unrecorded\r\nphenomenon, the eclipse of one satellite by another.[13]\r\n\r\nThe satellites when far from Jupiter seem to lie in a straight line\r\nthrough his centre. But as a matter of fact they do not in general lie\r\nin an exact straight line. If their orbits could be seen as lines of\r\nlight, they would appear, in general, as very long ellipses. The orbit\r\nof the fourth would frequently be seen to be _quite clear_ of Jupiter's\r\ndisc, and the orbit of the third might in some very exceptional\r\ninstances pass _just_ clear of the disc. The satellites move most nearly\r\nin a straight line (apparently) when Jupiter comes to opposition in the\r\nbeginning of February or August, and they appear to depart most from\r\nrectilinear motion when opposition occurs in the beginning of May and\r\nNovember. At these epochs the fourth satellite may be seen to pass above\r\nand below Jupiter's disc at a distance equal to about one-sixth of the\r\ndisc's radius.\r\n\r\nThe shadows do not travel in the same apparent paths as the satellites\r\nthemselves across the disc, but (in an inverting telescope) _below_ from\r\nAugust to January, and _above_ from February to July.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the most charming telescopic object in the heavens--the\r\nplanet Saturn. Inferior only to Jupiter in mass and volume, this planet\r\nsurpasses him in the magnificence of his system. Seen in a telescope of\r\nadequate power, Saturn is an object of surpassing loveliness. He must be\r\nan unimaginative man who can see Saturn for the first time in such a\r\ntelescope, without a feeling of awe and amazement. If there is any\r\nobject in the heavens--I except not even the Sun--calculated to impress\r\none with a sense of the wisdom and omnipotence of the Creator it is\r\nthis. \"His fashioning hand\" is indeed visible throughout space, but in\r\nSaturn's system it is most impressively manifest.\r\n\r\nSaturn, to be satisfactorily seen, requires a much more powerful\r\ntelescope than Jupiter. A good 2-inch telescope will do much, however,\r\nin exhibiting his rings and belts. I have never seen him satisfactorily\r\nmyself with such an aperture, but Mr. Grover has not only seen the\r\nabove-named features, but even a penumbra to the shadow on the rings\r\nwith a 2-inch telescope.\r\n\r\nSaturn revolving round the sun in a long period--nearly thirty\r\nyears--presents slowly varying changes of appearance (see Plate 7). At\r\none time the edge of his ring is turned nearly towards the earth; seven\r\nor eight years later his rings are as much open as they can ever be;\r\nthen they gradually close up during a corresponding interval; open out\r\nagain, exhibiting a different face; and finally close up as first seen.\r\nThe last epoch of greatest opening occurred in 1856, the next occurs in\r\n1870: the last epoch of disappearance occurred in 1862-63, the next\r\noccurs in 1879. The successive views obtained are as in Plate 7 in order\r\nfrom right to left, then back to the right-hand figure (but sloped the\r\nother way); inverting the page we have this figure thus sloped, and the\r\nfollowing changes are now indicated by the other figures in order back\r\nto the first (but sloped the other way and still inverted), thus\r\nreturning to the right-hand figure as seen without inversion.\r\n\r\nThe division in the ring can be seen in a good 2-inch aperture in\r\nfavourable weather. The dark ring requires a good 4-inch and good\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nSaturn's satellites do not, like Jupiter's, form a system of nearly\r\nequal bodies. Titan, the sixth, is probably larger than any of\r\nJupiter's satellites. The eighth also (Japetus) is a large body,\r\nprobably at least equal to Jupiter's third satellite. But Rhea, Dione,\r\nand Tethys are much less conspicuous, and the other three cannot be seen\r\nwithout more powerful telescopes than those we are here dealing with.\r\n\r\nSo far as my own experience goes, I consider that the five larger\r\nsatellites may be seen distinctly in good weather with a good 3-1/2-inch\r\naperture. I have never seen them with such an aperture, but I judge from\r\nthe distinctness with which these satellites may be seen with a 4-inch\r\naperture. Titan is generally to be looked for at a considerable distance\r\nfrom Saturn--_always_ when the ring is widely open. Japetus is to be\r\nlooked for yet farther from the disc. In fact, when Saturn comes to\r\nopposition in perihelion (in winter only this can happen) Japetus may be\r\nas far from Saturn as one-third of the apparent diameter of the moon. I\r\nbelieve that under these circumstances, or even under less favourable\r\ncircumstances, Japetus could be seen with a good opera-glass. So also\r\nmight Titan.\r\n\r\nTransits, eclipses, and occulations of Saturn's satellites can only be\r\nseen when the ring is turned nearly edgewise towards the earth. For the\r\norbits of the seven inner satellites lying nearly in the plane of the\r\nrings would (if visible throughout their extent) then only appear as\r\nstraight lines, or as long ellipses cutting the planet's disc.\r\n\r\nThe belts on Saturn are not very conspicuous. A good 3-1/2-inch is\r\nrequired (so far as my experience extends) to show them satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nThe rings when turned edgewise either towards the earth or sun, are not\r\nvisible in ordinary telescopes, neither can they be seen when the earth\r\nand sun are on opposite sides of the rings. In powerful telescopes the\r\nrings seem never entirely to disappear.\r\n\r\nThe shadow of the planet on the rings may be well seen with a good\r\n2-inch telescope, which will also show Ball's division in the rings. The\r\nshadow of the rings on the planet is a somewhat more difficult feature.\r\nThe shadow of the planet on the rings is best seen when the rings are\r\nwell open and the planet is in or near quadrature. It is to be looked\r\nfor to the left of the ball (in an inverting telescope) at quadrature\r\npreceding opposition, and to the right at quadrature following\r\nopposition. Saturn is more likely to be studied at the latter than at\r\nthe former quadrature, as in quadrature preceding opposition he is a\r\nmorning star. The shadow of the rings on the planet is best seen when\r\nthe rings are but moderately open, and Saturn is in or near quadrature.\r\nWhen the shadow lies outside the rings it is best seen, as the dark ring\r\ntakes off from the sharpness of the contrast when the shadow lies within\r\nthe ring. It would take more space than I can spare here to show how it\r\nis to be determined (independently) whether the shadow lies within or\r\nwithout the ring. But the 'Nautical Almanac' gives the means of\r\ndetermining this point. When, in the table for assigning the appearance\r\nof the rings, _l_ is less than _l'_ the shadow lies outside the ring,\r\nwhen _l_ is greater than _l'_ the shadow lies within the ring.\r\n\r\nUranus is just visible to the naked eye when he is in opposition, and\r\nhis place accurately known. But he presents no phenomena of interest. I\r\nhave seen him under powers which made his disc nearly equal to that of\r\nthe moon, yet could see nothing but a faint bluish disc.\r\n\r\nNeptune also is easily found if his place be accurately noted on a map,\r\nand a good finder used. We have only to turn the telescope to a few\r\nstars seen in the finder nearly in the place marked in our map, and\r\npresently we shall recognise the one we want by the peculiarity of its\r\nlight. What is the lowest power which will exhibit Neptune as a disc I\r\ndo not know, but I am certain no observer can mistake him for a fixed\r\nstar with a 2-inch aperture and a few minutes' patient scrutiny in\r\nfavourable weather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nHALF-HOURS WITH THE SUN AND MOON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moon perhaps is the easiest of all objects of telescopic\r\nobservation. A very moderate telescope will show her most striking\r\nfeatures, while each increase of power is repaid by a view of new\r\ndetails. Yet in one sense the moon is a disappointing object even to the\r\npossessor of a first-class instrument. For the most careful and\r\npersistent scrutiny, carried on for a long series of years, too often\r\nfails to reward the observer by any new discoveries of interest. Our\r\nobserver must therefore rather be prepared to enjoy the observation of\r\nrecognised features than expect to add by his labours to our knowledge\r\nof the earth's nearest neighbour.\r\n\r\nAlthough the moon is a pleasing and surprising telescopic object when\r\nfull, the most interesting views of her features are obtained at other\r\nseasons. If we follow the moon as she waxes or wanes, we see the true\r\nnature of that rough and bleak mountain scenery, which when the moon is\r\nfull is partially softened through the want of sharp contrasts of light\r\nand shadow. If we watch, even for half an hour only, the changing form\r\nof the ragged line separating light from darkness on the moon's disc, we\r\ncannot fail to be interested. \"The outlying and isolated peak of some\r\ngreat mountain-chain becomes gradually larger, and is finally merged in\r\nthe general luminous surface; great circular spaces, enclosed with rough\r\nand rocky walls many miles in diameter, become apparent; some with flat\r\nand perfectly smooth floors, variegated with streaks; others in which\r\nthe flat floor is dotted with numerous pits or covered with broken\r\nfragments of rock. Occasionally a regularly-formed and unusually\r\nsymmetrical circular formation makes its appearance; the exterior\r\nsurface of the wall bristling with terraces rising gradually from the\r\nplain, the interior one much more steep, and instead of a flat floor,\r\nthe inner space is concave or cup-shaped, with a solitary peak rising in\r\nthe centre. Solitary peaks rise from the level plains and cast their\r\nlong narrow shadows athwart the smooth surface. Vast plains of a dusky\r\ntint become visible, not perfectly level, but covered with ripples,\r\npits, and projections. Circular wells, which have no surrounding wall\r\ndip below the plain, and are met with even in the interior of the\r\ncircular mountains and on the tops of their walls. From some of the\r\nmountains great streams of a brilliant white radiate in all directions\r\nand can be traced for hundreds of miles. We see, again, great fissures,\r\nalmost perfectly straight and of great length, although very narrow,\r\nwhich appear like the cracks in moist clayey soil when dried by the\r\nsun.\"[14]\r\n\r\nBut interesting as these views may be, it was not for such discoveries\r\nas these that astronomers examined the surface of the moon. The\r\nexamination of mere peculiarities of physical condition is, after all,\r\nbut barren labour, if it lead to no discovery of physical variation. The\r\nprincipal charm of astronomy, as indeed of all observational science,\r\nlies in the study of change--of progress, development, and decay, and\r\nspecially of systematic variations taking place in regularly-recurring\r\ncycles. And it is in this relation that the moon has been so\r\ndisappointing an object of astronomical observation. For two centuries\r\nand a half her face has been scanned with the closest possible scrutiny;\r\nher features have been portrayed in elaborate maps; many an astronomer\r\nhas given a large portion of his life to the work of examining craters,\r\nplains, mountains, and valleys, for the signs of change; but until\r\nlately no certain evidence--or rather, no evidence save of the most\r\ndoubtful character--has been afforded that the moon is other than \"a\r\ndead and useless waste of extinct volcanoes.\" Whether the examination of\r\nthe remarkable spot called Linné--where lately signs were supposed to\r\nhave been seen of a process of volcanic eruption--will prove an\r\nexception to this rule, remains to be seen. The evidence seems to me\r\nstrongly to favour the supposition of a change of some sort having taken\r\nplace in this neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe sort of scrutiny required for the discovery of changes, or for the\r\ndetermination of their extent, is far too close and laborious to be\r\nattractive to the general observer. Yet the kind of observation which\r\navails best for the purpose is perhaps also the most interesting which he\r\ncan apply to the lunar details. The peculiarities presented by a spot upon\r\nthe moon are to be observed from hour to hour (or from day to day,\r\naccording to the size of the spot) as the sun's light gradually sweeps\r\nacross it, until the spot is fully lighted; then as the moon wanes and the\r\nsun's light gradually passes from the spot, the series of observations is\r\nto be renewed. A comparison of them is likely--especially if the observer\r\nis a good artist and has executed several faithful delineations of the\r\nregion under observation, to throw much light upon the real contour of the\r\nmoon's surface at this point.\r\n\r\nIn the two lunar views in Plate 7 some of the peculiarities I have\r\ndescribed are illustrated. But the patient observer will easily be able\r\nto construct for himself a set of interesting views of different\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nIt may be noticed that for observation of the waning moon there is no\r\noccasion to wait for those hours in which only the waning moon is\r\nvisible _during the night_. Of course for the observation of a\r\nparticular region under a particular illumination, the observer has no\r\nchoice as to hour. But for generally interesting observations of the\r\nwaning moon he can wait till morning and observe by daylight. The moon\r\nis, of course, very easily found by the unaided eye (in the day time)\r\nwhen not very near to the sun; and the methods described in Chapter V.\r\nwill enable the observer to find the moon when she is so near to the sun\r\nas to present the narrowest possible sickle of light.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting features of the moon, when she is observed\r\nwith a good telescope, is the variety of colour presented by different\r\nparts of her surface. We see regions of the purest white--regions which\r\none would be apt to speak of as _snow-covered_, if one could conceive\r\nthe possibility that snow should have fallen where (now, at least) there\r\nis neither air nor water. Then there are the so-called seas, large grey\r\nor neutral-tinted regions, differing from the former not merely in\r\ncolour and in tone, but in the photographic quality of the light they\r\nreflect towards the earth. Some of the seas exhibit a greenish tint, as\r\nthe Sea of Serenity and the Sea of Humours. Where there is a central\r\nmountain within a circular depression, the surrounding plain is\r\ngenerally of a bluish steel-grey colour. There is a region called the\r\nMarsh of Sleep, which exhibits a pale red tint, a colour seen also near\r\nthe Hyrcinian mountains, within a circumvallation called Lichtenburg.\r\nThe brightest portion of the whole lunar disc is Aristarchus, the peaks\r\nof which shine often like stars, when the mountain is within the\r\nunillumined portion of the moon. The darkest regions are Grimaldi and\r\nEndymion and the great plain called Plato by modern astronomers--but, by\r\nHevelius, the Greater Black Lake.\r\n\r\nThe Sun.--Observation of the sun is perhaps on the whole the most\r\ninteresting work to which the possessor of a moderately good telescope\r\ncan apply his instrument. Those wonderful varieties in the appearance of\r\nthe solar surface which have so long perplexed astronomers, not only\r\nsupply in themselves interesting subjects of observation and\r\nexamination, but gain an enhanced meaning from the consideration that\r\nthey speak meaningly to us of the structure of an orb which is the\r\nsource of light and heat enjoyed by a series of dependent worlds whereof\r\nour earth is--in size at least--a comparatively insignificant member.\r\nSwayed by the attraction of this giant globe, Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus\r\nand Neptune, as well as the four minor planets, and the host of\r\nasteroids, sweep continuously in their appointed orbits, in ever new but\r\never safe and orderly relations amongst each other. If the sun's light\r\nand heat were lost, all life and work among the denizens of these orbs\r\nwould at once cease; if his attractive energy were destroyed, these orbs\r\nwould cease to form a _system_.\r\n\r\nThe sun may be observed conveniently in many ways, some more suited to\r\nthe general observer who has not time or opportunity for systematic\r\nobservation; others more instructive, though involving more of\r\npreparation and arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe simplest method of observing the sun is to use the telescope in the\r\nordinary manner, protecting the eye by means of dark-green or\r\nneutral-tinted glasses. Some of the most interesting views I have ever\r\nobtained of the sun, have resulted from the use of the ordinary\r\nterrestrial or erecting eye-piece, capped with a dark glass. The\r\nmagnifying power of such an eye-piece is, in general, much lower than\r\nthat available with astronomical eye-pieces. But vision is very pleasant\r\nand distinct when the sun is thus observed, and a patient scrutiny\r\nreveals almost every feature which the highest astronomical power\r\napplicable could exhibit. Then, owing to the greater number of\r\nintervening lenses, there is not the same necessity for great darkness\r\nor thickness in the coloured glass, so that the colours of the solar\r\nfeatures are seen much more satisfactorily than when astronomical\r\neye-pieces are employed.\r\n\r\nIn using astronomical eye-pieces it is convenient to have a rotating\r\nwheel attached, by which darkening glasses of different power may be\r\nbrought into use as the varying illumination may require.\r\n\r\nThose who wish to observe carefully and closely a minute portion of the\r\nsolar disc, should employ Dawes' eye-piece: in this a metallic screen\r\nplaced in the focus keeps away all light but such as passes through a\r\nminute hole in the diaphragm.\r\n\r\nAnother convenient method of diminishing the light is to use a glass\r\nprism, light being partially reflected from one of the exterior\r\nsurfaces, while the refracted portion is thrown out at another.\r\n\r\nVery beautiful and interesting views may be obtained by using such a\r\npyramidal box as is depicted in fig. 11.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 11._]\r\n\r\nThis box should be made of black cloth or calico fastened over a light\r\nframework of wire or cane. The base of the pyramid should be covered on\r\nthe inside with a sheet of white glazed paper, or with some other\r\nuniform white surface. Captain Noble, I believe, makes use of a surface\r\nof plaster of Paris, smoothed while wet with plate-glass. The door _b\r\nc_ enables the observer to \"change power\" without removing the box,\r\nwhile larger doors, _d e_ and _g f_, enable him to examine the image; a\r\ndark cloth, such as photographers use, being employed, if necessary, to\r\nkeep out extraneous light. The image may also be examined from without,\r\nif the bottom of the pyramid be formed of a sheet of cut-glass or oiled\r\ntissue-paper.\r\n\r\nWhen making use of the method just described, it is very necessary that\r\nthe telescope-tube should be well balanced. A method by which this may\r\nbe conveniently accomplished has been already described in Chapter I.\r\n\r\nBut, undoubtedly, for the possessor of a moderately good telescope there\r\nis no way of viewing the sun's features comparable to that now to be\r\ndescribed, which has been systematically and successfully applied for a\r\nlong series of years by the Rev. F. Howlett. To use his own words: \"Any\r\none possessing a good achromatic of not more than three inches'\r\naperture, who has a little dexterity with his pencil, and a little time\r\nat his disposal (all the better if it be at a somewhat early hour of the\r\nmorning)\" may by this method \"deliberately and satisfactorily view,\r\nmeasure, and (if skill suffice) delineate most of those interesting and\r\ngrand solar phenomena of which he may have read, or which he may have\r\nseen depicted, in various works on physical astronomy.\"[15]\r\n\r\nThe method in question depends on the same property which is involved in\r\nthe use of the pyramidal box just described, supplemented (where exact\r\nand systematic observation is required) by the fact that objects lying\r\non or between the lenses of the eye-piece are to be seen faithfully\r\nprojected on the white surface on which the sun's image is received. In\r\nplace, however, of a box carried upon the telescope-tube, a darkened\r\nroom (or true _camera obscura_) contains the receiving sheet.\r\n\r\nA chamber is to be selected, having a window looking towards the\r\nsouth--a little easterly, if possible, so as to admit of morning\r\nobservation. All windows are to be completely darkened save one, through\r\nwhich the telescope is directed towards the sun. An arrangement is to be\r\nadopted for preventing all light from entering by this window except\r\nsuch light as passes down the tube of the telescope. This can readily be\r\nmanaged with a little ingenuity. Mr. Howlett describes an excellent\r\nmethod. The following, perhaps, will sufficiently serve the purposes of\r\nthe general observer:--A plain frame (portable) is to be constructed to\r\nfit into the window: to the four sides of this frame triangular pieces\r\nof cloth (impervious to light) are to be attached, their shape being\r\nsuch that when their adjacent edges are sewn together and the flaps\r\nstretched out, they form a rectangular pyramid of which the frame is the\r\nbase. Through the vertex of this pyramid (near which, of course, the\r\ncloth flaps are not sewn together) the telescope tube is to be passed,\r\nand an elastic cord so placed round the ends of the flaps as to prevent\r\nany light from penetrating between them and the telescope. It will now\r\nbe possible, without disturbing the screen (fixed in the window), to\r\nmove the telescope so as to follow the sun during the time of\r\nobservation. And the same arrangement will serve for all seasons, if so\r\nmanaged that the elastic cord is not far from the middle of the\r\ntelescope-tube; for in this case the range of motion is small compared\r\nto the range of the tube's extremity.\r\n\r\nA large screen of good drawing-paper should next be prepared. This\r\nshould be stretched on a light frame of wood, and placed on an easel,\r\nthe legs of which should be furnished with holes and pegs that the\r\nscreen may be set at any required height, and be brought square to the\r\ntube's axis. A large T-square of light wood will be useful to enable the\r\nobserver to judge whether the screen is properly situated in the last\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nWe wish now to direct the tube towards the sun, and this \"without\r\ndazzling the eyes as by the ordinary method.\" This may be done in two\r\nways. We may either, before commencing work--that is, before fastening\r\nour elastic cord so as to exclude all light--direct the tube so that its\r\nshadow shall be a perfect circle (when of course it is truly directed),\r\nthen fasten the cord and afterwards we can easily keep the sun in the\r\nfield by slightly shifting the tube as occasion requires. Or (if the\r\nelastic cord has already been fastened) we may remove the eye-tube and\r\nshift the telescope-tube about--the direction in which the sun lies\r\nbeing roughly known--until we see the spot of light received down the\r\ntelescope's axis grow brighter and brighter and finally become a _spot\r\nof sun-light_. If a card be held near the focus of the telescope there\r\nwill be seen in fact an image of the sun. The telescope being now\r\nproperly directed, the eye-tube may be slipped in again, and the sun may\r\nbe kept in the field as before.\r\n\r\nThere will now be seen upon the screen a picture of the sun very\r\nbrilliant and pleasing, but perhaps a little out of focus. The focusing\r\nshould therefore next be attended to, the increase of clearness in the\r\nimage being the test of approach to the true focus. And again, it will\r\nbe well to try the effect of slight changes of distance between the\r\nscreen and the telescope's eye-piece. Mr. Howlett considers one yard as\r\na convenient distance for producing an excellent effect with almost any\r\neye-piece that the state of the atmosphere will admit of. Of course, the\r\nimage becomes more sharply defined if we bring the screen nearer to the\r\ntelescope, while all the details are enlarged when we move the screen\r\naway. The enlargement has no limits save those depending on the amount\r\nof light in the image. But, of course, the observer must not expect\r\nenlargement to bring with it a view of new details, after a certain\r\nmagnitude of image has been attained. Still there is something\r\ninstructive, I think, in occasionally getting a very magnified view of\r\nsome remarkable spot. I have often looked with enhanced feelings of awe\r\nand wonder on the gigantic image of a solar spot thrown by means of the\r\ndiagonal eye-piece upon the ceiling of the observing-room. Blurred and\r\nindistinct through over-magnifying, yet with a new meaning to me,\r\n_there_ the vast abysm lies pictured; vague imaginings of the vast and\r\nincomprehensible agencies at work in the great centre of our system\r\ncrowd unbidden into my mind; and I seem to _feel_--not merely think\r\nabout--the stupendous grandeur of that life-emitting orb.\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to observation:--By slightly shifting the tube,\r\ndifferent parts of the solar disc can be brought successively upon the\r\nscreen and scrutinized as readily as if they were drawn upon a chart.\r\n\"With a power of--say about 60 or 80 linear--the most minute solar spot,\r\nproperly so called, that is capable of formation\" (Mr. Howlett believes\r\n\"they are never less than three seconds in length or breadth) will be\r\nmore readily detected than by any other method,\" see Plate 7; \"as also\r\nwill any faculæ, mottling, or in short, any other phenomena that may\r\nthen be existing on the disc.\" \"Drifting clouds frequently sweep by, to\r\nvary the scene, and occasionally an aërial hail- or snow-storm.\" Mr.\r\nHowlett has more than once seen a distant flight of rooks pass slowly\r\nacross the disc with wonderful distinctness, when the sun has been at a\r\nlow altitude, and likewise, much more frequently, the rapid dash of\r\nstarlings, which, very much closer at hand, frequent his church-tower.\"\r\n\r\nAn eclipse of the sun, or a transit of an inferior planet, is also much\r\nbetter seen in this way than by any other method of observing the solar\r\ndisc. In Plate 7 are presented several solar spots as they have appeared\r\nto Mr. Howlett, with an instrument of moderate power. The grotesque\r\nforms of some of these are remarkable; and the variations the spots\r\nundergo from day to day are particularly interesting to the thoughtful\r\nobserver.\r\n\r\nA method of measuring the spots may now be described. It is not likely\r\nindeed that the ordinary observer will care to enter upon any systematic\r\nseries of measurements. But even in his case, the means of forming a\r\ngeneral comparison between the spots he sees at different times cannot\r\nfail to be valuable. Also the knowledge--which a simple method of\r\nmeasurement supplies--of the actual dimensions of a spot in miles\r\n(roughly) is calculated to enhance our estimate of the importance of\r\nthese features of the solar disc. I give Mr. Howlett's method in his own\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n\"Cause your optician to rule for you on a circular piece of glass a\r\nnumber of fine graduations, the 200th part of an inch apart, each fifth\r\nand tenth line being of a different length in order to assist the eye in\r\ntheir enumeration. Insert this between the anterior and posterior lenses\r\nof a Huygenian eye-piece of moderate power, say 80 linear. Direct your\r\ntelescope upon the sun, and having so arranged it that the whole disc of\r\nthe sun may be projected on the screen, count carefully the number of\r\ngraduations that are seen to exactly occupy the solar diameter.... It\r\nmatters not in which direction you measure your diameter, provided only\r\nthe sun has risen some 18° or 20° above the horizon, and so escaped the\r\ndistortion occasioned by refraction.[16]\r\n\r\n\"Next let us suppose that our observer has been observing the sun on any\r\nday of the year, say, if you choose, at the time of its mean apparent\r\ndiameter, namely about the first of April or first of October, and has\r\nascertained that\" (as is the case with Mr. Howlett's instrument)\r\n\"sixty-four graduations occupy the diameter of the projected image. Now\r\nthe semi-diameter of the sun, at the epochs above mentioned, according\r\nto the tables given for every day of the year in the 'Nautical Almanac'\r\n(the same as in Dietrichsen and Hannay's very useful compilation) is\r\n16' 2\", and consequently his mean total diameter is 32' 4\" or 1924\". If\r\nnow we divide 1924\" by 64\" this will, of course, award as nearly as\r\npossible 30\" as the value in celestial arc of each graduation, either as\r\nseen on the screen, or as applied directly to the sun or any heavenly\r\nbody large enough to be measured by it.\"\r\n\r\nSince the sun's diameter is about 850,000 miles, each graduation (in the\r\ncase above specified) corresponds to one-64th part of 850,000\r\nmiles--that is, to a length of 13,256 miles on the sun's surface. Any\r\nother case can be treated in precisely the same manner.\r\n\r\nIt will be found easy so to place the screen that the distance between\r\nsuccessive graduations (as seen projected upon the screen) may\r\ncorrespond to any desired unit of linear measurement--say an inch. Then\r\nif the observer use transparent tracing-paper ruled with faint lines\r\nforming squares half-an-inch in size, he can comfortably copy directly\r\nfrom the screen any solar phenomena he may be struck with. A variety of\r\nmethods of drawing will suggest themselves. Mr. Howlett, in the paper I\r\nhave quoted from above, describes a very satisfactory method, which\r\nthose who are anxious to devote themselves seriously to solar\r\nobservation will do well to study.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary that the observer should be able to determine\r\napproximately where the sun's equator is situated at the time of any\r\nobservation, in order that he may assign to any spot or set of spots its\r\ntrue position in relation to solar longitude and latitude. Mr. Howlett\r\nshows how this may be done by three observations of the sun made at any\r\nfixed hour on successive days. Perhaps the following method will serve\r\nthe purpose of the general observer sufficiently well:--\r\n\r\nThe hour at which the sun crosses the meridian must be taken for the\r\nspecial observation now to be described. This hour can always be learnt\r\nfrom 'Dietrichsen's Almanac'; but noon, civil time, is near enough for\r\npractical purposes. Now it is necessary first to know the position of\r\nthe ecliptic with reference to the celestial equator. Of course, at noon\r\na horizontal line across the sun's disc is parallel to the equator, but\r\nthe position of that diameter of the sun which coincides with the\r\necliptic is not constant: at the summer and winter solstices this\r\ndiameter coincides with the other, or is horizontal at noon; at the\r\nspring equinox the sun (which travels on the ecliptic) is passing\r\ntowards the north of the equator, crossing that curve at an angle of\r\n23-1/2°, so that the ecliptic coincides with that diameter of the sun\r\nwhich cuts the horizontal one at an angle of 23-1/2° and has its _left_\r\nend above the horizontal diameter; and at the autumn equinox the sun is\r\ndescending and the same description applies, only that the diameter\r\n(inclined 23-1/2° to the horizon) which has its _right_ end uppermost,\r\nnow represents the ecliptic. For intermediate dates, use the following\r\nlittle table:--\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDate.              |Dec. 22|Jan. 5|Jan. 20|Feb. 4|Feb. 19|Mar. 5 |Mar. 21\r\n(Circiter.)        |       |June 6|May 21 |May 5 |Apr. 20|Apr. 5 |\r\n-------------------+-------+------+-------+------+-------+-------+--------\r\nInclination of     |Left   |Left  |Left   |Left  |Left   |Left   |Left\r\nEcliptical Diameter|       |      |       |      |       |       |\r\nof Sun to the      |0° 0'  |6°24' |12°14' |17°3' |20°36' |22°44' |23°27'\r\nHorizon.[17]       |Right  |Right |Right  |Right |Right  |Right  |Right\r\n-------------------+-------+------+-------+------+-------+-------+--------\r\nDate.              |       |Dec. 7|Nov. 22|Nov. 7|Oct. 23|Oct. 8 |\r\n(Circiter.)        |Jan. 21|July 7|July 23|Aug. 6|Aug. 23|Sept. 7|Sept. 23\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNow if our observer describe a circle, and draw a diameter inclined\r\naccording to above table, this diameter would represent the sun's\r\nequator if the axis of the sun were square to the ecliptic-plane. But\r\nthis axis is slightly inclined, the effect of which is, that on or about\r\nJune 10 the sun is situated as shown in fig. 14 with respect to the\r\necliptic _ab_; on or about September 11 he is situated as shown in fig.\r\n13; on or about December 11 as shown in fig. 12; and on or about March\r\n10 as shown in fig. 15. The inclination of his equator to the ecliptic\r\nbeing so small, the student can find little difficulty in determining\r\nwith sufficient approximation the relation of the sun's polar axis to\r\nthe ecliptic on intermediate days, since the equator is never more\r\n_inclined_ than in figs. 12 and 14, never more _opened out_ than in\r\nfigs. 13 and 15. Having then drawn a line to represent the sun's\r\necliptical diameter inclined to the horizontal diameter as above\r\ndescribed, and having (with this line to correspond to _ab_ in figs.\r\n12-15) drawn in the sun's equator suitably inclined and opened out, he\r\nhas the sun's actual presentation (at noon) as seen with an erecting\r\neye-piece. Holding his picture upside down, he has the sun's\r\npresentation as seen with an astronomical eye-piece--and, finally,\r\nlooking at his picture from behind (without inverting it), he has the\r\npresentation seen when the sun is projected on the screen. Hence, if he\r\nmake a copy of this last view of his diagram upon the centre of his\r\nscreen, and using a low power, bring the whole of the sun's image to\r\ncoincide with the circle thus drawn (to a suitable scale) on the screen,\r\nhe will at once see what is the true position of the different\r\nsun-spots. After a little practice the construction of a suitably sized\r\nand marked circle on the screen will not occupy more than a minute or\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 12._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 13._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 14._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 15._]\r\n\r\nIt must be noticed that the sun's apparent diameter is not always the\r\nsame. He is nearer to us in winter than in summer, and, of course, his\r\napparent diameter is greater at the former than at the latter season.\r\nThe variation of the apparent diameter corresponds (inversely) to the\r\nvariation of distance. As the sun's greatest distance from the earth is\r\n93,000,000 miles (pretty nearly) and his least 90,000,000, his greatest,\r\nmean, and least apparent diameters are as 93, 91-1/2, and 90\r\nrespectively; that is, as 62, 61, and 60 respectively.\r\n\r\nMr. Howlett considers that with a good 3-inch telescope, applied in the\r\nmanner we have described, all the solar features may be seen, except the\r\nseparate granules disclosed by first-class instruments in the hands of\r\nsuch observers as Dawes, Huggins, or Secchi. Faculæ may, of course, be\r\nwell seen. They are to be looked for near spots which lie close to the\r\nsun's limb.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun's general surface is carefully scrutinised, it is found to\r\npresent a mottled appearance. This is a somewhat delicate feature. It\r\nresults, undoubtedly, from the combined effect of the granules\r\nseparately seen in powerful instruments. Sir John Herschel has stated\r\nthat he cannot recognise the marbled appearance of the sun with an\r\nachromatic. Mr. Webb, however, has seen this appearance with such a\r\ntelescope, of moderate power, used with direct vision; and certainly I\r\ncan corroborate Mr. Howlett in the statement that this appearance may be\r\nmost distinctly seen when the image of the sun is received within a\r\nwell-darkened room.\r\n\r\nMy space will not permit me to enter here upon the discussion of any of\r\nthose interesting speculations which have been broached concerning solar\r\nphenomena. We may hope that the great eclipse of August, 1868, which\r\npromises to be the most favourable (for effective observation) that has\r\never taken place, will afford astronomers the opportunity of resolving\r\nsome important questions. It seems as if we were on the verge of great\r\ndiscoveries,--and certainly, if persevering and well-directed labour\r\nwould seem in any case to render such discoveries due as man's just\r\nreward, we may well say that he deserves shortly to reap a harvest of\r\nexact knowledge respecting solar phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Such a telescope is most powerful with the shortest sight.\r\nIt may be remarked that the use of a telescope often reveals a\r\ndifference in the sight of the two eyes. In my own case, for instance, I\r\nhave found that the left eye is very short-sighted, the sight of the\r\nright eye being of about the average range. Accordingly with my left eye\r\na 5-1/2-foot object-glass, alone, forms an effective telescope, with\r\nwhich I can see Jupiter's moons quite distinctly, and under favourable\r\ncircumstances even Saturn's rings. I find that the full moon is too\r\nbright to be observed in this way without pain, except at low\r\naltitudes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Betelgeuse--commonly interpreted the Giant's\r\nShoulder--_ibt-al-jauza_. The words, however, really signify, \"the\r\narmpit of the central one,\" Orion being so named because he is divided\r\ncentrally by the equator.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: I have never been able to see more than four with a\r\n3-3/4-inch aperture. I give a view of the trapezium as seen with an\r\n8-inch equatorial.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Sir W. Herschel several times saw [epsilon] Lyræ as a\r\ndouble. Bessel also relates that when he was a lad of thirteen he could\r\nsee this star double. I think persons having average eye-sight could see\r\nit double if they selected a suitable hour for observation. My own\r\neye-sight is not good enough for this, but I can distinctly see this\r\nstar wedged whenever the line joining the components is inclined about\r\n45° to the horizon, and also when Lyra is near the zenith.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: They were so described by Admiral Smyth in 1839. Mr. Main,\r\nin 1862, describes them as straw-coloured and reddish, while Mr. Webb,\r\nin 1865, saw them pale-yellow and _lilac_!]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Or the observer may sweep from [omicron] towards [nu],\r\nlooking for R about two-fifths of the way from [omicron] to [nu].]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Here a single period only is taken, to get back to a\r\nconvenient hour of the evening.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Here a single period only is taken, to get back to a\r\nconvenient hour of the evening.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: I have constructed a zodiac-chart, which will enable the\r\nstudent to mark in the path of a planet, at any season of the year, from\r\nthe recorded places in the almanacs.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: It is convenient to remember that through precession a\r\nstar near the ecliptic shifts as respects the R.A. and Dec. lines,\r\nthrough an arc of one degree--or nearly twice the moon's diameter--in\r\nabout 72 years, all other stars through a less arc.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Mercury is best seen when in quadrature to the sun, but\r\n_not_ (as I have seen stated) at those quadratures in which he attains\r\nhis maximum elongation from the sun. This will appear singular, because\r\nthe maximum elongation is about 27°, the minimum only about 18°. But it\r\nhappens that in our northern latitudes Mercury is always _south_ of the\r\nsun when he attains his maximum elongation, and this fact exercises a\r\nmore important effect than the mere amount of elongation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: It does not seem to me that the difficulty of detecting\r\nMercury is due to the difficulty \"of identifying it amongst the\r\nsurrounding stars, during the short time that it can be seen\" (Hind's\r\n'Introduction to Astronomy'). There are few stars which are comparable\r\nwith Mercury in brilliancy, when seen under the same light.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: I may notice another error sometimes made. It is said that\r\nthe shadow of a satellite _appears_ elliptical when near the edge of the\r\ndisc. The shadow is _in reality_ elliptical when thus situated, but\r\n_appears_ circular. A moment's consideration will show that this should\r\nbe so. The part of the disc concealed by a _satellite_ near the limb is\r\nalso elliptical, but of course appears round.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: From a paper by Mr. Breen, in the 'Popular Science\r\nReview,' October, 1864.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: 'Intellectual Observer' for July, 1867, to which magazine\r\nthe reader is referred for full details of Mr. Howlett's method of\r\nobservation, and for illustrations of the appliances he made use of, and\r\nof some of his results.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: As the sun does not attain such an altitude as 18° during\r\ntwo months in the year, it is well to notice that the true length of the\r\nsun's apparent solar diameter is determinable even immediately after\r\nsun-rise, if the line of graduation is made to coincide with the\r\n_horizontal_ diameter of the picture on the screen--for refraction does\r\nnot affect the length of this diameter.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: The words \"Left\" and \"Right\" indicate which end of the\r\nsun's ecliptical diameter is uppermost at the dates in upper or lower\r\nrow respectively.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON:\r\n\r\nPRINTED BY W.
