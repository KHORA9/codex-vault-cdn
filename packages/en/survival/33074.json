It has been contended that our various types\r\nhad a common origin in the wild hog, and that the difference in form,\r\ncolour, and character amongst the local breeds is due, in the main, to\r\nthe requirements, imaginary or real, of the interested residents in the\r\nparticular districts. On the other hand, it is asserted with equal\r\nconfidence, and probably with the same amount of actual proof, that it\r\nwould be impossible so to improve the wild hog by selection as to render\r\nit the equal of the domesticated hog. There must, therefore, have been\r\nan infusion of blood of a cultivated breed of pigs to acquire even that\r\namount of success which was noticeable in the improved pig of a century,\r\nor less, ago. Unfortunately, for this argument, it has not been possible\r\nto obtain any information of value as to the alleged source of origin of\r\nthis cultivated breed of pigs.\r\n\r\nAgain, those pigs which possess in a marked degree early maturity, fine\r\nquality of flesh, and those other characteristics of the improved pig,\r\nare so various in colour, that one cultivated breed only could not have\r\nbeen utilised in the general improvement.\r\n\r\nAll the ancient writers on pigs appear to have experienced the same\r\ndifficulty when endeavouring to discover the sources of origin of the\r\nmaterial which might have been used in the production of the pig which\r\nin their time was looked upon as the domesticated and improved pig of\r\nthe period. This difficulty extends even to the present day. So far as\r\nis known there exists no actual proof that the domesticated hog has been\r\nevolved in any particular way other than by continued selection of those\r\nanimals for breeding purposes which possessed in the greatest degree\r\nthose particular qualities held in the highest estimation at the time.\r\n\r\nOf course, the soil, climate, etc., of the district in which pigs are\r\nreared have a certain amount of influence, but this is noticeable to a\r\nmuch lesser extent with pigs than with horses, cattle, or sheep, since\r\nunder the present system of pig-breeding the greater portion of the food\r\nused in the different districts is of a very similar character--indeed,\r\nmuch of it has a common origin--having been imported from abroad.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, comparatively speaking very little difference is noticeable\r\nin the development, form, and character of pigs bred in the various\r\nparts of the country, whereas with some of the other domesticated\r\nanimals a very considerable change follows the removal of sheep of a\r\npure breed from one district to another. The quality and quantity of the\r\nwool, flesh, and bone are all affected. An exactly similar effect is\r\nnoticeable when horses of a particular breed are moved from one district\r\nto another. For instance, a Shire foal bred in the Fens may possess the\r\ncharacteristic bone, flesh, and hair, yet if it be moved into portions\r\nof the Eastern counties where the soil is of a totally different\r\ncharacter, it will when matured have lost, to a very considerable\r\nextent, its peculiar characteristics of bone and hair. The changes\r\nwrought may be due in small measure to climate, but the predominant\r\ncause must be due to the variation in the food grown on soils of a\r\ndifferent character.\r\n\r\nThis question of the original cause or causes of the varying colour of\r\nthe pigs in different localities appears to be equally difficult of\r\nsolution. As to the continuation in certain districts of pigs of one\r\ncolour, custom and even prejudice have a great effect. So strong is this\r\nprejudice that some persons will even declare that the pork of pigs of\r\nthe fashionable colour in the neighbourhood is superior to that from\r\npigs of any other colour. As this weakness is common in districts where\r\nblack and where white pigs are kept it must be admitted that prejudice\r\nalone must be the foundation of the belief.\r\n\r\nProbably the safest conclusion to arrive at with respect to the\r\nvariation in colour of the pigs noticeable in certain districts is that\r\nin the long ago the native pig in the wild state was of the colour of\r\nthe soil and the herbage in which it sheltered, and was thus less\r\nconspicuous to its enemies, whether human or animal. A marked instance\r\nof this is to be found in the colour of the common or original pig found\r\nin some parts of the country where the soil is of a decidedly red\r\ncolour. In the district referred to one actually hears some farms spoken\r\nof as \"red land farms.\" What more natural than to find in the districts\r\nin which land of this hue predominates that the pigs should be a red\r\nrusty hue such as was the original colour of that breed of pigs now\r\ncalled the Tamworth breed.\r\n\r\nSome persons, who do not agree with this theory of the origin of the\r\nvarious coloured pigs, cite as a proof of their belief the fact that in\r\nso many districts the pigs are of a mixed colour, and that this peculiar\r\nmarking is equally as general in localities as is any particular or\r\nspecial colour in the pigs. This is perfectly true, and it is probably\r\ndue to exactly the same causes, fancy, prejudice, or custom. The\r\nresidents in certain districts have grown accustomed to certain things\r\nor certain forms, and are loth to change; the manufacturer of any\r\narticle must humour the actual or fancied requirements of his customers\r\nif he is to secure success; and in a similar manner the breeder of pigs\r\nhas to consider and to produce pigs of the form, size, and colour which\r\nare most in demand. Further if, as confidently alleged, there is a\r\npreference in some districts for pork from pigs of a certain colour,\r\nthen the butcher naturally offers a higher price for pigs of that colour\r\nwhich most fully satisfy the fancies of his customers, and thus we find\r\na similarity of form and colour in the pigs of various districts.\r\n\r\nAs to the origin of these parti-coloured pigs, the explanation offered\r\nis that even in pre-railway times there was a certain amount of\r\ninterchange of the different local breeds of stock. This would be\r\naffected in various ways, which need not be specified.\r\n\r\nAt the present time we have several defined and distinct breeds of pigs\r\nwhich have secured recognition at our principal agricultural shows.\r\nIndeed it may be claimed that the exhibitions of live stock which have\r\nbecome so general in all parts of the country have been one of the chief\r\nfactors in fixing to a certain extent the type and character of certain\r\nlocal breeds. Within the memory of the present writer the classification\r\nof pigs at our principal shows was of a very simple character; it\r\nconsisted of classes for pigs of a white colour and for pigs of any\r\nother colour. There was no attempt at any definition as to size, form,\r\nand quality of the pigs. These points were left entirely to the judges,\r\nwho naturally were led to favour pigs of the type which they bred. There\r\nwas thus a greater amount of uncertainty as to the success of an\r\nexhibitor's stock than at the present time. This uncertainty--save as to\r\nthe members of the Show Committees or their friends--was increased by\r\nthe unfair system of withholding from the knowledge of the average\r\nexhibitor the names of those selected to judge.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of some definition, if only of colour, quickly became\r\nobvious. At first classes were established for pigs of certain colours;\r\nthen the prizes were offered for pigs of certain breeds, which were more\r\nor less loosely defined. Now at the chief shows the pigs exhibited in\r\nthe various classes must be qualified for entry in the herd books of the\r\nparticular breeds.\r\n\r\nAt the Royal Agricultural Shows there have been classes for pigs of the\r\nLarge White, Middle White, Berkshire, Tamworth, Large Black and\r\nLincolnshire Curly Coated breeds; whilst for the next show classes for\r\npigs of the so-called Gloucestershire Old Spots breed are to be\r\nincluded. As showing the changes which are in progress it may be noted\r\nthat two breeds of pigs which had classes provided for them at the Royal\r\nand some other Shows have become extinct. These were the Small White and\r\nthe Small Black breeds--the sole cause of their disappearance being the\r\nunsuitability of the pigs of the breeds to supply the present\r\nrequirements of the consumer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo, Sport and General._\r\n\r\nLARGE BLACK BOAR, \"DRAYTON KING.\"\r\n\r\nOwner, Terah F.

This type was undoubtedly fixed by the wants or fancies of\r\nthose resident in the particular portions of the country.\r\n\r\nIn the past it has been the practice when describing these local breeds\r\nto write as though they were confined to certain counties. It may be\r\nthat pigs of a peculiar or characteristic type are more numerous within\r\nthe borders of various counties, but this is by no means always the\r\ncase. The habits and pursuits of the inhabitants rather than the soil\r\nand climate--as with horses, cattle and sheep--have the greatest\r\ninfluence on the form, size and quality of the local pigs, whilst use\r\nand custom appear to determine the colour of the pig. We are of opinion\r\nthat it will be more instructive if we give a short description of some\r\nof the more common types of these local breeds of pigs, and mention the\r\nnames of those counties in which they are more generally found.\r\n\r\nAmongst the most distinct of these local breeds is that which is\r\nvariously termed the sheeted or saddle-backed pig, which in the United\r\nStates has a society to look after its interests, and where it bears the\r\nname of\r\n\r\nTHE HAMPSHIRE\r\n\r\nJust why our American cousins should have decided to call these sheeted\r\npigs Hampshires is not on the surface, since the oldest writers on pigs\r\ngive to the county of Sussex the credit of being their original home.\r\nThe description given by Sidney of the Hampshire pig is that \"it is a\r\ncoarse and useful black pig, inferior to the Berkshire, and not in the\r\nsame refined class as the Essex.\" Richardson writes \"The Hampshire breed\r\nis not infrequently confounded with the Berkshire; but its body is\r\nlonger and its sides flatter; the head is long and the snout sharp. The\r\ncolour of the breed is usually dark spotted; but it is sometimes black\r\naltogether, and more frequently white.\"\r\n\r\nThe sheeted pig has also been bred in the county of Essex for over a\r\ncentury, but it is recorded that it was introduced into this county by a\r\nMr. Western who subsequently became Lord Western, and whose estate was\r\nsituated in Essex.\r\n\r\nIn Sidney's book _The Pig_, we read, \"West Sussex, Hampshire, Berkshire,\r\nDorset, Shropshire and Wales had indigenous black or red and black\r\nbreeds of swine; and between the whites, the blacks and the reds the\r\nparti-colours were produced which have since in a great degree\r\ndisappeared under the influence of prizes, generally awarded to pure\r\nbreeds of single colours.\"\r\n\r\nSidney also states \"that Youatt and all the authors who have followed\r\nhim down to the latest work published on the subject, occupy space in\r\ndescribing various county pigs which have long ceased to possess, if\r\nthey ever possessed, any merit worth the attention of the breeder.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rudgwick, which is another name for the sheeted pig, is included in\r\nthe list. Richardson at a still earlier date describes the Sussex breed\r\nas \"black and white in colour, but not _spotted_; that is to say, these\r\ncolours are distributed in very large patches; one half--say, for\r\ninstance, the fore part of the body white and the hinder end black; or\r\nsometimes both ends black and the middle white or _vice versa_; these\r\npigs are in no way remarkable; they seldom feed to over twenty stone.\r\nThey are well made, of middle size, and their skin covered with scanty\r\nbristles. The snout tapering and firm, the ears upright and pointed, the\r\njowl deep and the body compactly round. They arrive at early maturity,\r\nfatten quickly, and the flesh is excellent.\"\r\n\r\nRichardson also writes, \"There is another improved Essex breed, called\r\nthe Essex Half-Blacks, resembling that which I have described in colour,\r\nsaid to be descended from the Berkshire. This breed was originally\r\nintroduced by Lord Western, and obtained much celebrity,\" etc. etc.\r\n\r\nHe then quotes from _The Complete Grazier_, sixth edition, as follows:\r\n\"They are black and white, short haired, fine skinned with smaller heads\r\nand ears than the Berkshire, but feathered with inside hair which is a\r\ndistinctive mark of both; have short snubby noses, very fine bone, broad\r\nand deep in the belly, full in the hind quarters, but light in the bone\r\nand offal. They feed remarkably fast and are of an excellent quality of\r\nmeat. The sows are good breeders, and bring litters of from eight to\r\ntwelve; but they have the character of being bad nurses.\" If this\r\nallegation were true at the time it was written, it is not at the\r\npresent time as the Half-Blacks or sheeted sows are both prolific and\r\nfirst-rate mothers.\r\n\r\nMalden describes the Sussex: \"A large breed called the Rudgwick, was one\r\nof the largest in England. There appears to be a doubt as to whether the\r\ncoloured pig was descended from the spotted Berkshire or the black and\r\nwhite Essex. They were of medium size, of good quality generally, but of\r\nsomewhat heavy bone.\" The generally accepted view is that the Essex\r\nsheeted pig was descended from importations from the county of Sussex.\r\nThese sheeted pigs are still occasionally met with in Essex, but the\r\nsystem of crossing which is generally followed by pig breeders in the\r\ncounty is gradually reducing its number, although even amongst the\r\ncross-breeds the peculiar marking occasionally shows itself. At the time\r\nof writing there is a movement on foot to form a society for the purpose\r\nof reviving the breed. From the utility point of view the sheeted pig\r\nhas much to recommend it, but whether or not one or more of the breeds\r\nof pigs whose pedigrees are already recorded do not possess at least\r\nequal merits must be left for decision by others.\r\n\r\nSPOTTED PIGS\r\n\r\nIn many districts are found other parti-coloured pigs, but in these the\r\nblack, the white, and the red colours show themselves in spots of\r\nvarying size and extent. Probably amongst the best types of these\r\nspotted pigs is the one found over the greater part of the county of\r\nNorthampton, and portions of the counties of Leicester and Oxford\r\nadjoining. In the former county the pigs have more of black than white\r\nin their colouring, whilst in the two latter red spots are more often\r\nseen. This is probably due to a stronger infusion of the blood of the\r\nStaffordshire red pig which is now known as the Tamworth. The blood of\r\nthe Neapolitan pig through the Berkshire or the Small Black is credited\r\nwith being the origin of the darker coloured Northamptonshire spotted\r\npig. The qualities claimed for these spotted or \"plum pudding\" pigs as\r\nthey are locally termed, are prolificacy, quick growth, hardihood, and\r\nthe production of pork possessing a large proportion of lean to fat\r\nmeat. They are also good grazers, and grow to a size quite the equal of\r\nthe Berkshire. In form they are perhaps more suited for the fresh pork\r\ntrade than for the manufacture of bacon of the kind now so much in\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nTHE LARGE WHITE AND BLUE PIGS\r\n\r\nThose large, coarse-boned pigs with hair of a white colour and skins\r\nmore or less mottled with blue are gradually giving place to pigs with\r\nfiner hair, skin, bone, and quality of meat. The coarse lop ears are\r\nbeing reduced in size and thickness, whilst the pig itself is becoming\r\nless gaunt and its early maturity considerably increased by crossing\r\nwith the better quality Large White and the quickly maturing Middle\r\nWhite. These coarse white with blue markings pigs were common in the\r\nFens of Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, the Isle of Ely and Lincolnshire, and\r\nin the counties of Bedford, Cheshire, etc.\r\n\r\nWHITE PIGS\r\n\r\nWithin the memory of persons now living, white pigs of varying types\r\nwere found in various parts of this country. Many of these white pigs\r\nfound in Norfolk, Suffolk, Shropshire, and Wales had little to recommend\r\nthem as they were flat sided, long legged, hard feeders, and required to\r\nbe comparatively old before they could be turned into pork. A vast\r\nimprovement has of late years been effected in these unprofitable swine\r\nby crossing them with compact and early maturing pigs of different\r\ncolours, but mainly white pigs until the last few years, when Large\r\nBlacks and even a few Gloucestershire Old Spots boars have been\r\nintroduced in Norfolk.\r\n\r\nAt one time white pigs of a small size were by no means uncommon in\r\nSuffolk, Essex, Middlesex, Yorkshire, and parts of Berkshire, and other\r\ncounties. The origin of these small, compact, and early maturing pigs\r\nappears to have been a cross of the imported Chinese on the neater and\r\nshorter country pigs of a white colour. For a period these handsome\r\npigs were quite fashionable amongst the well-to-do, but the general\r\npublic objected to the pork produced by them, owing to its excessive\r\nfatness. The bacon curers still more strongly objected to the short\r\nsides and the very small amount of lean meat in the cured carcases.\r\nDuring the last thirty years comparatively few of these pretty, but\r\nuseless, pigs have been bred.\r\n\r\nBLACK PIGS\r\n\r\nThe description given of the two main types of white pigs would apply\r\nequally well to the Black pigs common in this country, save with respect\r\nto colour. The long flat-sided black pig was found in Essex, Suffolk,\r\nCambridgeshire, Sussex, etc. These pigs were noted for their\r\nprolificacy, hardihood, and quick growth, whilst the sows furnished a\r\nfull supply of milk to their youngsters, but they were such slow feeders\r\nthat it became necessary to cross them with pigs which matured more\r\nquickly. A type of black pig similar in form to the Small White was also\r\nfound in Essex and Suffolk, whilst in Devonshire, Dorset, and one or two\r\nother counties the colour of the pigs was blue rather than black, and of\r\na somewhat larger size, but possessing the same weakness, too large a\r\nproportion of fat to lean meat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nPURE BREEDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe task of writing a description of the various breeds of swine has\r\nbeen rendered less difficult by the formation during the past\r\nhalf-century of societies for the registration of the pedigrees of the\r\npigs of the different breeds, and by the setting up of scales of those\r\npoints which pigs for entry in the particular herd books should possess.\r\nThe first of these societies was the National Pig Breeders Association,\r\nof which the present writer was the honorary secretary for two years. At\r\nthe time of its formation the breeds of pigs most generally recognised\r\nwere the Berkshire, the Large, Middle, and Small Whites or Yorkshires,\r\nand the Small Black breed. It was intended that the pedigrees of the\r\npure bred pigs of each of these breeds should be recorded by the\r\nAssociation and published in one herd book.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that this would have been an ideal plan, and would\r\nhave resulted in a saving of much labour and expense, and decidedly more\r\nconvenient for those connected with the export trade. For reasons into\r\nwhich it is not now necessary to enter, the breeders of Berkshires\r\ndetermined to have a separate herd book; therefore, they started a\r\nsociety which they named the British Berkshire Society, to distinguish\r\nit from the American Berkshire Record.\r\n\r\nSubsequently the Tamworth breed of pigs became recognised by the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society, and the breeders of the red pig joined the\r\nNational Pig Breeders Association. Then the demand for Small White and\r\nSmall Black pigs ceased, so that eventually the pedigrees of Large\r\nWhite, Middle White, and Tamworth pigs only were registered in the\r\nN.P.A. Herd Book.\r\n\r\nSubsequently the breeders of Tamworth pigs formed themselves into a\r\nsociety presumably for propaganda work, and to conserve the interests of\r\nbreeders of Tamworth pigs. Of late years other breeds of pigs have been\r\nbrought to public notice, and have had herd books, and societies\r\nspecially devoted to their particular interests. The Large Black, Large\r\nWhite Ulster, the Lincolnshire Curly Coated pigs, the Gloucestershire\r\nOld Spots, and the Cumberland pigs have their pedigrees recorded. An\r\nattempt was made some years since to resuscitate the Oxfordshire Spotted\r\npig, but it was not a continued success. It is quite possible that other\r\nlocal breeds of pigs may find sufficient admirers to form societies to\r\nbring before the public the many good qualities possessed by the pigs of\r\nthese breeds, but apart from local interest it is at least doubtful if\r\nany permanent benefit will supervene from this multiplication of herd\r\nbooks--save that it may increase the interest in pig breeding, a result\r\ndevoutly to be prayed for.\r\n\r\nThe issuing of the scales of points of those breeds of pigs whose\r\npedigrees are recorded in the various herd books has rendered it\r\nunnecessary for us to endeavour to formulate the good qualities which\r\nare presumably those which are more or less completely possessed by\r\nthese pedigreed animals, nor does the necessity exist for us to mention\r\nthose particular qualities which each breed is supposed by the admirers\r\nof other breeds to lack. There is no doubt that each breed possesses\r\ncertain points which render it specially suitable for differing\r\nlocalities and varying purposes.\r\n\r\nSome persons who look upon a pig solely as an animal, as a converter of\r\nvarious substances into pork, are of opinion that the tendency of those\r\nresponsible for the running of these societies is towards fancy points\r\nto the detriment of the practical points. There appears to have been\r\nsome grounds for this view. The Small White, the Small Black, the\r\nBerkshire, and the Large White have all been affected by the acts of\r\nfaddists. The three first-named breeds suffered from the aims of certain\r\nof the breeders to reduce the size and to increase the so-called quality\r\nuntil the consumers of pork refused to follow the fashion; whilst the\r\ncraze which has seriously affected the utility of the Large White pigs\r\nhas been exactly the opposite, i.e. an endeavour to so vastly increase\r\nthe size that they ceased to supply the kind of pork and the size of\r\njoints which the general public demanded. It may be natural for fanciers\r\nto declare that a Small White or a Small Black pig must be a small\r\nanimal, but this is only on comparison with the large breeds of the same\r\ncolour and characteristics. The usefulness of the pig in the commercial\r\nworld must be studied if any breed of pig is to hold its own on the\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nThe opposite extreme to that followed by the breeders of the small\r\nbreeds is that of the breeders of Large Whites, who look upon mere size\r\nas the most important of the points to be studied. The mere increase in\r\nbulk, in length of head and leg and weight of bone may appeal to the\r\nmere fancier or faddist, but by paying undue attention to these fancy\r\npoints the actual object of the breeding and fattening of pigs is lost\r\nsight of, and the consumer who is after all the one whose wants must\r\nfirst receive study, is estranged and the commercial market is lost.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages will be found full particulars together with the\r\nscales of points, as issued by the various societies, of the chief\r\nbreeds and varieties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF EXCELLENCE\r\n\r\nLARGE WHITE\r\n\r\nCOLOUR.--White, free from black hairs, and as free as possible from blue\r\nspots on the skin.\r\n\r\nHEAD.--Moderately long, face slightly dished, snout broad, not too much\r\nturned up, jowl not too heavy, wide between the ears.\r\n\r\nEARS.--Long, thin, slightly inclined forward, and fringed with fine\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nNECK.--Long, and proportionately full to shoulders.\r\n\r\nCHEST.--Wide and deep.\r\n\r\nSHOULDERS.--Level across the top, not too wide, free from coarseness.\r\n\r\nLEGS.--Straight and well set, level with the outside of the body with\r\nflat bone.\r\n\r\nPASTERNS.--Short and springy.\r\n\r\nFEET.--Strong, even, and wide.\r\n\r\nBACK.--Long, level, and wide from neck to rump.\r\n\r\nLOIN.--Broad.\r\n\r\nTAIL.--Set high, stout and long, but not coarse, with tassel of fine\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nSIDES.--Deep.\r\n\r\nRIBS.--Well sprung.\r\n\r\nBELLY.--Full, but not flabby, with straight under line.\r\n\r\nFLANK.--Thick, and well let down.\r\n\r\nQUARTERS.--Long and wide.\r\n\r\nHAMS.--Broad, full, and deep to hocks.\r\n\r\nCOAT.--Long and moderately fine.\r\n\r\nACTION.--Firm and free.\r\n\r\nSKIN.--Not too thick, quite free from wrinkles.\r\n\r\nLarge bred pigs do not fully develop their points until some months old,\r\nthe pig at five months often proving at a year or 15 months a much\r\nbetter animal than could be anticipated at the earlier age and _vice\r\nversa_;

There are those\r\nwho term a pig a cross-bred unless it be bred from parents of recorded\r\npedigree, or those which possess pedigrees capable of registration.\r\nOthers claim that a cross-bred is any pig which is bred indiscriminately\r\nfrom boar and sow of no particular type or breeding--in fact common pigs\r\nof the country; whilst still others declare that the title of cross-bred\r\ncan be legitimately applied only to a pig whose parents were of two\r\ndifferent pure breeds in contradistinction to a pig sired by a pure bred\r\nboar, and from a common sow, or the diverse way.\r\n\r\nIt is not for us to determine the knotty point, but we may venture the\r\nopinion that the two first definitions of a cross-bred are not\r\nconvincing to us, since in order to produce a cross-bred it is necessary\r\nto have a sire, or a dam, or both of defined breeds. Probably the most\r\ncorrect definition of a cross-bred animal is one bred from the mating of\r\nsire and dam of two distinct breeds, but the term is now loosely applied\r\nto an animal begotten by a sire or from a dam of pedigree breeding, the\r\nother parent being of no particular breed.\r\n\r\nThis system of breeding has become somewhat common owing to the\r\ncomparatively small outlay required in the purchase of a boar as\r\ncompared with the purchase of both boar and sows, and also to the belief\r\nwhich is general that a greater improvement in the produce is noticeable\r\nwhen the boar is pure bred and the sows of ordinary or no particular\r\nbreed, than if the sows are pure bred and the boar a common bred one. In\r\naddition to this there is the important point that the pure bred boar\r\nshould be able to beget at least fifty litters in a year whereas the\r\npure bred sow will not produce more than two litters annually, so that\r\nthe advantage obtainable from the outlay on one pure bred boar is\r\ntwenty-five times as great as is possible from the purchase of a pure\r\nbred sow.\r\n\r\nThere is also another advantage to the owner of a boar who has only a\r\nlimited number of sows, he can allow his neighbours to make use of his\r\nboar on payment of a liberal service fee, which combined will partially\r\npay for the prime cost of the boar.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of pig breeders are influenced in the purchase of\r\na pure bred boar rather than of a sow by the belief that pure bred sows\r\nare neither so prolific nor such good mothers as are common bred sows.\r\nThis belief was even more common in years gone by than it is at the\r\npresent time, and it must be candidly confessed that there existed\r\nsubstantial grounds for it. Some fifty years since it became\r\nfashionable, particularly amongst those who had suddenly become rich by\r\ntrade or in other ways, to exhibit live-stock at the agricultural shows.\r\nThey may have been animated by the laudable desire of endeavouring to\r\nassist farmers and stock breeders generally, or a desire to gain a place\r\nin the sun may have had some slight influence. As the majority of these\r\nexhibitors of stock had no special knowledge of stock, they were\r\ncompelled to place themselves entirely in the hands of their managers\r\nand stockman, who generally received by arrangement a certain percentage\r\nof the prize money won by the stock. It was then only natural that they\r\ngave far more attention to the show points of the animals in their\r\ncharge than to the breeding qualities.\r\n\r\nThe supply of pedigree animals was also very limited at about the period\r\nmentioned so that it was much more difficult to avoid too close\r\nbreeding, nor was there the same care taken in the private record of the\r\npedigrees of the animals bred. These various causes combined led to a\r\nloss of vitality amongst the so-called pedigree stock, and this\r\nweakening of the constitution showed itself in a reduction in the number\r\nof the offspring and in the power of the dam to furnish its young with a\r\nfull supply of well-balanced milk.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that in the third quarter of the past century a\r\nconsiderable proportion of the pedigree sows were not so prolific as\r\nthey ought to have been, nor did they produce and rear thoroughly well\r\nso many pigs at each litter as the common sow of the country was capable\r\nof doing. A more general study of stock breeding has tended to compel\r\nattention to the practical apart from the show points of pedigree pigs,\r\nbut probably the strongest influence has been the formation of the\r\nvarious breed societies, and the registration of the produce including\r\nthe number, sex, and sire of the pigs. These entries most clearly showed\r\nthose breeders of pigs who had paid most attention to the utility points\r\nof their pigs, especially those particular points in which pedigree pigs\r\nwere generally believed to be deficient. The succeeding records of sows\r\nof the same families afforded the best possible confirmation of the\r\nbelief which was becoming general that prolificacy like many other\r\nqualities was most certainly hereditary. This recorded proof that pure\r\nbred animals and especially pigs were not necessarily slow breeders,\r\nhelped vastly to increase the demand for pedigree animals for crossing\r\npurposes in the breeding of commercial stock.\r\n\r\nThe enormous benefit which has resulted from the use of pedigree sires\r\nis most clearly proved in the Irish live stock. The so-called premium\r\nbulls and boars are pedigree animals purchased by or with the sanction\r\nof the Live Stock Commissioners and placed at the service of the general\r\npublic at a somewhat reduced fee, the Government paying to the owner an\r\nannual premium of some [L]15 for each bull, and a certain sum for each\r\nboar.\r\n\r\nIt is alleged that the original improvement in the ordinary pig stock of\r\nthose parts of Ireland where pig-keeping on a considerable scale is\r\nfollowed, was due to the purchase in England of numbers of Large White\r\nboars, as after experiments carried out in Denmark, these boars were\r\nfound to effect the greatest improvement in the common country pigs and\r\nto render them far more suitable for conversion into the kind of bacon\r\nwhich was in most general demand, and of course realised the highest\r\nprice. For the beginning of the vast improvement in the Irish pig which\r\nhas followed the importation of these Large White boars, the Irish bacon\r\ncurers must receive the credit, as they joined together in the purchase\r\nof these boars which were distributed in those districts from which the\r\nvarious factories drew their supplies of fat pigs.\r\n\r\nA similar plan was adopted by Messrs. Harris of Calne who purchased some\r\nhundreds of boars of the Large White breed, and at first lent them on\r\ncertain conditions to pig breeders, but later on resold the young boars\r\nby auction for whatever they would fetch, their object being to secure\r\nthe use of these boars in order to render the farm pigs more suitable\r\nfor the purposes of their trade as bacon curers.\r\n\r\nThere may or may not be any grounds for the belief that the sire has a\r\ngreater influence in the external form of the joint produce than does\r\nthe dam, but this belief has also had its influence in determining\r\nbreeders of cross breds to use the pure bred sire on the ordinary stock\r\nof the country, rather than the reverse way. There is no doubt that\r\napart from the improvement in the general quality of the produce of the\r\npure bred sire there results a general uniformity of the young stock,\r\nwhich is a great recommendation when they are placed on the market\r\neither as stores, or when fattened for the butcher or bacon curer. This\r\nuniformity of type and character in the young stock would be more\r\nnoticeable still if the buyers of the pure bred sires were to continue\r\ntheir purchases from the same herds, providing that the owners of them\r\nwere sufficiently careful in avoiding incestuous breeding.\r\n\r\nSo many people appear to be content with the knowledge that the sire\r\nwhich they are purchasing has a recorded pedigree and is a pure bred\r\nsire eligible for entry in the herd book of its breed, but they forget\r\nthat it is possible in the crossing of two pedigree animals of a similar\r\nbreed to obtain as great a mixture of blood and points as in the mating\r\nof two cross-breds or two come-by-chances. Uniformity in a herd, stud,\r\nor flock can only be rendered comparatively certain by the continued use\r\nof sires of similar breeding. In making a compound, its character is\r\ndetermined by the proportion of the various ingredients used in its\r\nmanufacture. So it is in the breeding of stock, those points which are\r\nmost predominant in proportion in the blood of the sire and dam will, on\r\nthe average, be represented in an equal degree in the joint produce.\r\nThis it is which renders so impressive a sire which is descended from\r\nclosely bred parents. Each of its forbears has handed down a proportion\r\nof its own particular characteristics so that the larger the number of\r\nanimals amongst its forbears which possessed these particular points the\r\ngreater the certainty of their being possessed by the produce. The\r\nmeaning of this may be made more clear by pointing out that the result\r\nof the mixing together of various mixtures will depend entirely on the\r\nproportion of the substances used in the manufacture or compounding of\r\nthose mixtures. In each animal is embodied the characteristics of its\r\nforbears.\r\n\r\nThere exists generally an opinion that the produce of two parents of\r\ndistinct breeds, or as it is termed a first cross is commonly superior\r\nto a pure bred of either of the two breeds represented by the parents.\r\nIt is difficult to discover the cause of this, if it be a fact. If one\r\nof the parents were deficient in stamina the produce might conceivably\r\nbe more robust, and it might also occasionally happen that the mixture\r\nof the qualities or properties possessed by the parents would result in\r\nimprovement, as happens when a distinct new breed is originated; but as\r\na rule the good and the bad qualities of the produce from the mating of\r\ntwo animals of diverse breeds are in direct proportion to the qualities\r\npossessed by the parents.\r\n\r\nThe mere mixing of the blood of two animals differently bred cannot\r\nincrease the good or bad properties, but the combination might possibly\r\nresult in a blend more suitable for the purpose in hand.\r\n\r\nAnother claim commonly made for the crossing of animals is that the risk\r\nof that delicacy of constitution which they assert is far too common\r\namongst pure bred animals, and is due to close breeding, is hereby\r\navoided. It must be admitted that in times past there was a certain\r\namount of cause for this complaint of want of constitution amongst\r\npedigree animals, but the cause has been considerably if not entirely\r\nremoved by the more careful recording of the breeding, and by the more\r\ndrastic screening out of any animals suspected of delicacy of\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nThe buyers of pure bred animals for crossing purposes have also become\r\nmore careful in their selection. They have ceased to imagine that\r\nbecause the owner of certain animals most of which he has purchased is\r\nsuccessful in winning prizes at the chief agricultural shows, the whole\r\nof the animals in his stud, herd, or flock must be of equal excellence\r\nor at all events sufficiently good for the production of profitable\r\ncommercial stock. Action on this mistaken belief has led to much\r\ndisappointment in the past, since the home bred animals may have been of\r\ntotally different blood from those which have won prizes, and further\r\nthey may not be inbred for a sufficiently long time on distinct lines to\r\nrender them prepotent enough to impress their good qualities on their\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\nAmongst the objections made to cross-breeding is the heavy cost of\r\nreplacing the breeding stock, as to obtain a first cross, a succession\r\nof sires and dams must be purchased. Many persons meet this difficulty\r\nby merely buying sires of a breed similar to the first used, but then\r\nthe produce ceases to be cross-breds and become grades until such time\r\nas by the use of a certain number of sires of a similar breed the\r\nproduce become eligible for entry in the herd book of the sires which\r\nhave been continuously used. This system of breeding insures a greater\r\nuniformity in the produce providing that the sires selected are of\r\nsimilar breeding, type, and character, than even by the system of\r\ncrossing sire and dam of two pure breeds.\r\n\r\nThe risk attending too close breeding as in the breeding of pure breds\r\nis also avoided provided that the herd from which the sires are bought\r\nis sufficiently large to furnish a change of blood, yet of similar\r\nbreeding.\r\n\r\nNo one possessing a knowledge of the ordinary farm stock of the country\r\nwill for one moment deny that there is still vast room for improvement\r\nin our live stock, and particularly in our pigs, and it is equally the\r\nfact that our Government has not shown a readiness equal to that of some\r\nforeign Governments, and even of the authorities in some of our colonies\r\nto assist farmers in obtaining the use of improved sires. Take Canada as\r\nan instance. For years the Dominion Live Stock Branch has been\r\npurchasing and delivering free into districts needing them, male animals\r\nfor the use of farmers and stock owners free, save stallions, for which\r\na covering fee has to be paid sufficient to cover the insurance of the\r\nstallion. The other important condition which relates to all the sires\r\nprovided by the authorities is that the cost of maintenance shall be\r\npaid by the Local Association which has the management of the sire and\r\nthe arrangement of its services.\r\n\r\nAnother noticeable point is that all the sires allocated to the various\r\ndistricts are Canadian bred, and so far as is possible are purchased in\r\nthe province in which they are to be located. The object is undoubtedly\r\nto encourage in Canada the breeding of pure bred animals and may thus\r\nfar be considered satisfactory, but it is acting on an assumption which\r\nmay not be justified that there exists in the Dominion a sufficiency of\r\nstock equal in quality and breeding to those which it may be possible to\r\nimport.\r\n\r\nWithin the past three or four years our Board of Agriculture have taken\r\nsome steps to assist our farmers to improve their stock. The assistance\r\nhas taken the form of offering premiums of fixed amounts to private\r\npersons or associations who hired or purchased approved stallions,\r\nbulls, and boars which were placed at fixed fees at the service of the\r\nstock of the public. Already great benefit has been derived from the use\r\nof the stallions and bulls, and this to a far greater extent than in the\r\npigs, as owing to an unfortunate condition which was attempted to be\r\nenforced as to the formation of pig clubs and impracticable conditions\r\nthe number of boars located in the country has been much smaller than\r\nwould have been had the conditions at present in force been adopted at\r\nthe initiation of the scheme.\r\n\r\nThe boar conditions are now of a similar character to those in force\r\nfrom the first with regard to stallions and bulls. In addition to the\r\nsupply of male animals at comparatively low fees an attempt has been\r\nmade to assist in the recording of the milk yield of cows, a matter of\r\nthe highest importance. If only this could be extended to sows there\r\nwould soon cease to be cause for the far too common complaint of the\r\nowners of sows of certain breeds of pedigree pigs, as to the limited\r\nquantity of milk which is provided by the sows for their litters of\r\npigs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo, Francis Davis, Needingworth._\r\n\r\nTHREE MIDDLE WHITE BREEDING SOWS.\r\n\r\nThe Property of the Author.

It is most\r\nannoying when you are anxious to purchase pigs of say six or seven\r\nmonths old which are quite ready to be quickly fattened, to have pigs of\r\nfour or five months old which continue to make growth instead of flesh,\r\nso that they are not ready for killing until two or three months after\r\nthey are required for conversion into bacon.\r\n\r\nAlthough the object of the Council of the Smithfield Club is to prevent\r\nfraud of a different character, i.e. the exhibition in classes limited\r\nto certain ages of pigs of an age greater than that given on the entry\r\nform, yet the following table showing the normal state of the dentition\r\nof pigs at certain fixed ages will enable purchasers to discover whether\r\nor not the seller has attempted to deceive him. It may at once be\r\nadmitted that there will be a limited number of cases in which the state\r\nof dentition of pigs is abnormal, but after examining the teeth of some\r\nthousands of pigs during the past sixty years, we have no hesitation in\r\nasserting that more than half, at least, of the variations from the\r\nnormal are allayed dentition. It is claimed that a man of experience is\r\nquite able to arrive at the approximate age of a pig by its development\r\nand appearance; some few persons may have that instinctive knowledge\r\nmore or less fully developed, but this examination of the state of\r\ndentition is of the greatest possible assistance in arriving at the\r\nactual age of the pig, particularly desirable as it is in case of a\r\ndifference of opinion between buyer and seller.\r\n\r\nThe following are the conditions of the state of dentition to which all\r\npigs have to conform ere they are allowed to compete for the prizes\r\noffered by the Smithfield Club at their annual shows:--\r\n\r\n\"Pigs having their corner permanent incisors cut will be considered as\r\nexceeding six months.\r\n\r\n\"Pigs having their permanent tusks more than half up will be considered\r\nas exceeding nine months.\r\n\r\n\"Pigs having their central permanent incisors up, and any of the first\r\nthree permanent molars cut, will be considered as exceeding twelve\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n\"Pigs having their lateral temporary incisors shed, and the permanents\r\nappearing will be considered as exceeding fifteen months.\r\n\r\n\"Pigs having their lateral permanent incisors fully up will be\r\nconsidered as exceeding eighteen months.\"\r\n\r\nAs the majority of the pigs bought of dealers by amateurs are young pigs\r\nit may be advisable to state that a pig of the age of eight weeks old\r\nshould have its two central incisors fully grown. A pig three months\r\nold should have all four temporary incisors cut, the two outside ones\r\nbeing more than half as long as the two central incisors.\r\n\r\nAs the first set of the teeth of a pig like that of a child are merely\r\ntemporary, and as these give place at fairly definite ages of the owner\r\nto permanent ones, it may be well to endeavour to describe as clearly as\r\npossible the position and appearance of the temporaries as compared with\r\nthe permanents. The pig is one of the few animals which is possessed of\r\nteeth at its birth; these number eight, two on each side of the upper\r\nand lower jaw. It has been suggested that these early teeth are provided\r\nto assist the pigling to grasp firmly the sow's teat when in the act of\r\nsucking. These eight teeth vary somewhat in length; those pigs which are\r\ncarried by the sow beyond the usual period of sixteen weeks frequently\r\nhave longer and even sharper teeth than those of pigs which are born at\r\nthe usual time. These longer teeth are also sometimes of a dark colour.\r\nThis is doubtless the origin of the remark commonly made by\r\nold-fashioned pigmen that \"pigs born with black teeth never do well.\"\r\nThis might have been so prior to the discovery that the breaking off the\r\nsharp teeth of the newly born pigs frequently saved trouble, and often\r\nthe life of the little pigs. Pigs whose teeth are discoloured at birth\r\nare usually more robust rather than the reverse, since the sow carrying\r\nthem beyond the allotted time is invariably in a vigorous state of\r\nhealth, and her pigs consequently more fully developed.\r\n\r\nWhen the pig is about a month old, the two central incisors are cut in\r\neach jaw, these are two of the four front teeth in each jaw of the pig\r\nat a subsequent age. Two temporary molars are also cut on each side of\r\nthe jaw above and below, with the first temporary molar in each place\r\nready to come through the gum.\r\n\r\nAt two months the temporary central incisors are fully developed, and\r\nthe two lateral temporary incisors can be seen in the gums, if they are\r\nnot already through. All three temporary molars are now about level.\r\n\r\nWhen the pig is about three months old its temporary teeth are all in\r\nposition, the temporary lateral incisors are through, and nearly as long\r\nas the temporary central incisors. Owing to the lengthening of the jaws\r\nthe two temporary corner teeth which were present at birth will have\r\nbecome further apart. When the pig is about five months, the fourth\r\nmolar in either jaw shows itself in the gums, then at six months the\r\nwolf teeth show between the tusks and the premolars, and the fourth\r\nmolar is nearly level with the first premolar. The corner incisors and\r\nthe tusks usually disappear, and are replaced by permanents when the pig\r\nis nine months old. The second permanent molar also shows itself. At\r\ntwelve months the two central temporary incisors give place to the\r\npermanents; these last are more square in form than the temporaries, and\r\nare thus easily distinguished. The three temporary molars will also be\r\nready for displacement by three permanents. These last will be level\r\nwith the other permanent molars when the pig is fifteen months. The two\r\nlateral incisors will also have given place to permanents. At eighteen\r\nmonths the third permanent molars will be coming through, and at the age\r\nof twenty months the pig's teeth are fully developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF THE BOAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hackneyed saying \"The sire is half the herd\" appears to have a\r\ndifferent meaning to varying persons. To some it conveys the idea that\r\nthe selection of the sire is of far more importance than the selection\r\nof the dam because the influence of the sire is so much more powerful\r\nthan that of the dam on at least the external form and character of the\r\nproduce. The late Mr. James Howard, who took a particularly keen\r\ninterest in the breeding of pigs, used to declare that the appearance\r\nand form of the young pigs far more generally followed those of the sire\r\nthan of the dam; whilst the influence of the latter was more shown in\r\nthe character and constitution of their joint produce; or in other\r\nwords, that the boar stamped his character to a greater extent on the\r\nexternal points of the young, whilst the sow more strongly influenced\r\nthe internal parts of the youngsters. It is quite possible that this\r\nidea has gained ground to a large extent from the fact that the use of a\r\npure bred sire on ordinary or grade females has been very much more\r\ncommon than the crossing of pure bred females by the ordinary or\r\nnon-pedigree sire; as also from the far greater numbers of young which\r\neach pure bred sire would improve, than would be improved by each pure\r\nbred female which might be crossed.\r\n\r\nIf only for this reason alone, we would always recommend buyers who are\r\ndesirous of grading up and improving their farm stock to attempt to do\r\nthis by the purchase or use of the pure bred or improved sire. The\r\noriginal outlay is infinitely less, whilst the immediate results are\r\ncomparatively longer.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely desirable to go further into the question as to the\r\ncomparative influence on the young of the sire and the dam since our\r\nactual knowledge of the subject is by no means large. Indeed, it is at\r\nthe least doubtful, if by the closest observation any definite opinion\r\non the subject is possible, so great is the difference which varying\r\nparents have on the chief characteristics of their joint progeny, and\r\neven in the separate specimens which they have procreated. Of course, it\r\nis quite possible to breed animals especially well developed or endowed\r\nwith certain qualities, providing that the parents have been for\r\ngenerations selected because of their possession in a marked degree of\r\nthose particular qualities sought. It is in this power of prepotency\r\nthat one of the chief benefits from the use of a pure bred sire or dam\r\narises. By the term pure bred is not meant merely that the names of a\r\ncertain number of the forbears of the animal shall have been recorded in\r\nthe register of the breed, but that the animal shall for a certain\r\nnumber of generations have been bred on similar lines so that it shall\r\npossess a considerable amount of concentrated blood. This is a point to\r\nwhich sufficient care is not generally given by purchasers of so-called\r\npedigree sires to be used on the ordinary bred or graded stock. The far\r\ntoo common practice is to purchase each boar required from a totally\r\ndifferent herd, or from one of quite dissimilar breeding, with the\r\nresult that there is not the slightest uniformity in the appearance or\r\ncharacter of the herd, or of the mature animals when ready for market.\r\n\r\nIt is far too frequently forgotten that the chief value of a record of\r\nthe pedigree is that by it one can trace the breeding of the animal's\r\nprogenitors, and thus one is enabled to form some opinion of the\r\nprobable produce--providing it is possible to learn the chief\r\ncharacteristics of the progenitors. Failing this, the only course open\r\nis to note the names of the breeders of the more recent parents, as from\r\nthis a certain amount of information as to the probable qualities of the\r\nparents may be obtained or surmised.\r\n\r\nAnother point on which at least a diversity of opinion exists, is the\r\nwisdom of giving so much consideration to the fact that the herd from\r\nwhich the sire is purchased shall have been recently successful in the\r\nshow yard, or in extreme cases, that the sire itself shall have been a\r\nprize winner. It is urged that the mere fact that a sire has succeeded\r\nin winning one or more prizes is a proof that it possesses in a marked\r\ndegree those qualities which are most highly prized. This may be\r\nconceded, yet there is no certainty that the mating of this winning sire\r\neven with dams that have also been prize winners shall result in the\r\nproduction of young the equal of the parents, since the winners at the\r\nvarious shows may be of dissimilar types and breeding.\r\n\r\nBut the case would be quite different if the winning sire and dam came\r\nfrom the same old established herd in which the animals had been bred\r\nfor generations on similar lines. It is this concentration of certain\r\nqualities in generation after generation which renders the pedigree\r\nanimal so intensely prepotent, particularly when mated with animals of\r\nan ordinary character or not possessing concentrated breeding. Indeed,\r\nit may be safely assumed that the power of a parent to impress its own\r\nindividuality and qualities on its produce, depends to a very large\r\nextent, if not entirely, on the comparative hereditary extent of those\r\nqualities in comparison with the other qualities possessed by itself, or\r\nby the animal with which it may have been mated.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it is contended that the sire or the dam has not the\r\npower to impress certain of its characteristics on its young, merely\r\nbecause of its sex, but that this power depends on the proportion in the\r\nsire or dam of the blood of progenitors who possessed in a marked degree\r\ncertain qualities.\r\n\r\nIt is with the breeding of animals as with the manufacture of a compound\r\narticle. The character and quality of that compound will vary according\r\nto the proportion of the various ingredients used in its manufacture. It\r\nis to this law or fact that the marked impressiveness of certain strains\r\nof blood is attributable.\r\n\r\nAgain, the marked and long continued success of the blood of the\r\nanimals bred by a few of our most successful breeders of live stock is\r\nin the main due to the fact that the owners set up a standard and\r\npersistently selected and bred together only animals possessing to a\r\ngreater or lesser extent the particular qualities which together\r\ncomprised that standard. There is not the slightest doubt that in\r\ncarrying out their system they were often compelled to mate animals\r\nrelated in blood the one to the other, but in this there is little risk\r\nproviding that all those animals which show the slightest symptom of\r\ndelicacy of constitution are persistently draughted out.\r\n\r\nIt will be inferred from the above remarks that we hold to the belief\r\nthat the breeding of the boar should receive attention as well as the\r\nfollowing points in its form and character.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important of these points is good temper. This is a\r\nquality not usually attributed to the pig in its wild state, and\r\nconsequently not natural to the domesticated pig, yet on the possession\r\nof it depends to a very great extent the thrift and well doing of the\r\nproduce of the boar. The produce of an irritable boar are almost certain\r\nto inherit this quality which is fatal to profitable fatting. In sows\r\nthis weakness is still more unfortunate, as a bad tempered sow is almost\r\ninvariably an indifferent mother. The rigid avoidance of this failing of\r\nbad temper in a boar is advisable not only because this quality is\r\nalmost invariably hereditary, but a savage boar is a continual source of\r\ndanger to man and beast. It may be said that little trouble is likely if\r\nthe boar is kept in confinement, but there are times, such as when sows\r\nare placed with him, when a certain amount of liberty must be given to\r\nhim, and it is generally on such occasions of excitement when the bad\r\ntemper is the most in evidence. The mere fact that irritability and\r\nnervousness are natural to the pig should make us the more careful to\r\navoid any increase in the failing by using a boar which is the least\r\ninclined to be bad tempered.\r\n\r\nMany persons hold that in the selection of a boar one of the principal\r\npoints is size. They contend that size, in pigs especially, is\r\nimperative if a profitable return is to be made. This view may have\r\narisen to a greater or lesser extent from the want of method and\r\nobservation which is characteristic of so many stock owners. The one\r\npoint which to them is of the greatest importance is the selling price\r\nof the fat or store animal sold being fully up to the average. Little or\r\nno thought is given to the value of the food eaten by each animal. If it\r\nhad been, very frequently it would have been found that the smaller\r\nanimal of a lot had actually given the best return for the food it had\r\nconsumed. It is not the size alone of the animal which determines its\r\nvalue as the producer of meat, but more than anything it is the feeding\r\nqualities of the animal fattened. In addition to this there never was a\r\ntime when the consumer more strongly demanded small joints of meat, and\r\nthese of the best quality and with as little bone as possible.\r\n\r\nApart from this a very large boar is a mistake as it is invariably\r\nawkward when serving--it can be used only for large and strong sows, and\r\nits average period of usefulness is decidedly shorter than that of a\r\nmedium sized and compact boar. A large boar generally possesses an undue\r\nproportion of bone, its shoulders are heavy, and its ankles round, and\r\nfeet large and spreading. Now these are all objections. The bone of a\r\nboar should be solid, not porous; the ankles compact and the feet small,\r\nand the pasterns short. The head should be wide so that the brain can be\r\nwell developed, the head inclined to be short rather than long, since an\r\nanimal with an extremely long head is certain to be deficient in natural\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\nOn the question of the size and hang of the ears a variety of opinion\r\nexists; pigs with long ears, and pigs with short ears are found\r\npossessing good carcases. It is the quality of the ear rather than its\r\nsize and hang which seems to indicate the character most. A pig with a\r\nthin and firm ear is usually of fine quality, whereas a pig which has a\r\nthick, coarse ear is generally coarse in bone, skin, flesh, and hair.\r\n\r\nThe neck of the boar should be muscular as indicating constitution and\r\nnatural vigour; the shoulders fine and obliquely laid, the ribs well\r\nsprung, the loin wide, the quarters long and square, not drooping, the\r\nhams full and extending quite down to the hocks, and without any of that\r\nloose skin which is far too common amongst the largest of our breeds of\r\npigs, and which is a sure sign of coarseness. The flank should be thick\r\nand well let down, as this indicates constitution and lean meat, the\r\nlegs should be fairly short and set well apart so that the heart, lungs,\r\nand other organs have plenty of room to perform their share of the work\r\nof the pig. The skin should be fine and the hair straight and silky, as\r\nwell as plenty of it. Sparsity of hair is generally an indication of\r\nshortage of lean meat, whilst curliness and coarseness of hair are far\r\ntoo frequently associated with excessive fat and coarseness of meat.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the reproductive parts of the boar there are one or two\r\npoints which should receive special attention. A boar with excessively\r\nsmall testicles should be avoided, as such a one is often barren. Again,\r\na boar with one testicle of normal size and the other smaller,\r\nordinarily suffers from the same disqualification to a lesser extent. A\r\nruptured boar should not on any account be used, as this weakness is\r\nstrongly hereditary. The weakness may not possibly show itself in the\r\nfirst generation, but it is certain to appear sooner or later. Not only\r\nis it a sure index of weakness of constitution, but pigs so affected\r\noccasionally die suddenly, whilst there is always a certain amount of\r\nrisk from the operation of castration.\r\n\r\nOccasionally one or more of the boar pigs of a litter will be found to\r\nbe malformed, in that only one of the testicles is apparent. Generally\r\nspeaking, the other is found when the pig is killed to be attached to\r\nthe inside of the pig, and thus is unable to descend into the scrotum or\r\npurse, so that the act of castration is only partially performed. A boar\r\npig with only one testicle down is commonly termed a rig. The removal of\r\none of the testicles does not deprive the rig of reproducing its\r\nspecies, and it is thus a source of continual trouble when herded with a\r\nlot of sow pigs now that the general custom is to allow the female pigs\r\nof a litter to remain unspayed. It is, therefore, necessary to fatten a\r\nrig either alone, or with male pigs which have been operated upon. In\r\naddition to this extra trouble, the flesh of a rig pig if it be kept\r\nfattening after it is some five or six months old is almost certain to\r\nbe strong in flavour, like unto that of a boar. It is, therefore,\r\nadvisable to fatten a rig quite early in life and convert it into a\r\nporket or porker carcase of pork.\r\n\r\nIt may appear strange to some readers to specially mention the teats of\r\nthe boar, but it is equally as necessary to avoid boars having small\r\nteats, teats unevenly placed, and commencing any distance from the fore\r\nlegs, and blind teats, as it is in the case of the sow, since any\r\nweaknesses of the kind are equally as hereditary from the boar as from\r\nthe sow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF THE SOW\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to agree with the view held by so many persons that the\r\nnecessity for the same care is non-existent in the selection of a sow as\r\nin the choice of a boar. We hold that the desirability for studying the\r\nforbears, especially the dam, of a young sow intended for breeding\r\npurposes is fully as great as when selecting the young boar, since many,\r\nif not most, of the qualities which we desire the brood sow to possess\r\nare strongly hereditary. Take, for instance, the question of gentleness\r\nor a quiet disposition, it follows from dam to produce with a regularity\r\nequal to that of bad temper, and the latter is wellnigh a certainty.\r\nAgain, whoever found that the female produce of a sow deficient in the\r\nmaternal instincts proved, if saved for breeding purposes, to be a\r\nreally good mother? As a rule the daughters of a sow which gives but a\r\nsmall quantity of milk, and that of an inferior quality, are also cursed\r\nwith the same grievous failings, but this does not appear to be\r\nuniversally the case, since the milking qualities of the dam descend\r\nthrough her sons, so that if the female progenitors of the boar have\r\nbeen good milkers it is probable that the boar's daughters may be able\r\nto rear their pigs successfully, even if their dam had not been in the\r\nhabit of suckling her pigs well.\r\n\r\nStill, it is quite safe to assert that with this one exception we may\r\nfairly anticipate that the good qualities which we seek in a sow are far\r\nmore likely to be found in the sow pigs of a sow herself the possessor,\r\nthan from one which does not possess them. We are inclined to the belief\r\nthat the alleged failure of some pedigree yelts to make good brood sows\r\nis in the main due to the continued selection for breeding purposes of\r\nthose pure-bred yelts which show early maturing and flesh-forming\r\nqualities, rather than that motherly look which is almost invariably to\r\nbe found in a sow which is prolific, a free milker, and a really good\r\nmother. There is a marked difference in the formation of a milk-giving\r\nand a fat-producing sow--the latter is generally somewhat heavy in the\r\nshoulders, has a muscular or fat neck, is rather short in the head and\r\nheavy in the jowl, and is altogether more compactly built, whereas a\r\ngood brood sow has rather a long face, is wide between the eyes, has a\r\nlight muscular neck, is fine in the shoulders, possesses long and square\r\nquarters and appears to be heavier in the hind than in the forequarters.\r\nShe is somewhat more loosely built and often shows less of quality.\r\nThickness of flank and length of side are desirable, the first as\r\nindicating substance and flesh, whilst the second gives plenty of room\r\nfor her pigs to suck. The bone should be of good quality; the same\r\nremarks apply to the skin and hair.\r\n\r\nAbout half a century since there existed a fancy, which almost amounted\r\nto a craze for sows of small size; they could not be too neat, and\r\nshowing too much so-called feminine character. The almost certain result\r\nof selecting the neatest of the female pigs followed, the fat pigs sent\r\nto market were light in weight, deficient in lean meat and rightly named\r\n\"animated bladders of lard.\" Within about the same distance of time it\r\nwas the common practice of exhibitors of pigs at the Smithfield Club's\r\nShows to provide pillows in the form of round pieces of wood on which\r\nthe fat pigs rested their heads so that these were raised in order to\r\nprevent the pigs becoming suffocated. In addition, the pigs were fed on\r\nforcing foods until they were at least one and a half year old and\r\nallowed to take, or were given little exercise, with the result that the\r\npork consisted mainly of soft fat or lard. To such an extent had this\r\ncraze for neatness been followed that the bacon curers and consumers of\r\npork wellnigh ceased to purchase or consume pork.\r\n\r\nAt the present time we are afraid that the tendency is in the opposite\r\ndirection, and mere size is receiving far too much attention. At some of\r\nour agricultural shows the judges select for honour great unwieldly sows\r\nwhich could not possibly perform with any amount of success those\r\nmaternal duties which a brood sow is supposed to be kept solely to\r\nperform. An extremely large sow is very frequently a poor milker, the\r\nquantity of milk she gives is not large, nor does she continue to give\r\neven this reduced supply for a period long enough to allow her young to\r\ngrow strong enough to make a good start in life on their own account.\r\n\r\nAnother great objection to a sow of extreme size is that her produce\r\nalmost invariably take after her to such an extent that it is difficult,\r\nif not wellnigh impossible, to make them fat until they are from nine to\r\ntwelve months old, and by that time they are too large and heavy for the\r\ngeneral demand which is at the present time, and likely to become still\r\nmore so in the future, for small joints of meat which carry a large\r\nproportion of lean and a limited quantity of bone. The most successful\r\nmanufacturer is he who most nearly supplies the consumer with that which\r\nhe requires or fancies. We are not moved by the contention of breeders\r\nof pedigree pigs that the most valuable pig is the one which possesses\r\nin the greatest degree those special points which are characteristic of\r\nthe breed, as, for instance, size in the pigs of the Large White, the\r\nLarge Black, and the Lincolnshire Curly Coated pigs, therefore the\r\nbiggest pigs should be held in the highest esteem. In our opinion the\r\nbest, as it is in the long run the most profitable, is the pig which\r\nfurnishes to the greatest extent exactly the kind of meat in the most\r\ngeneral demand.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these objections to an extremely large and ungainly sow\r\nis the fact that such an one is invariably clumsy in the breeding pen,\r\nshe is almost certain to lay on some of her pigs. It is even alleged\r\nthat her period of usefulness as a breeder is shorter than that of a sow\r\nof ordinary size.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo, Sport and General._\r\n\r\nTAMWORTH BOAR: BISHOP OF WEBTON.

If this duplication be necessary under such conditions, it must\r\nbe imperative on us to select those sow pigs which are intended for\r\nbreeding pigs which possess a well-formed udder, having a full supply of\r\nteats, and these of good shape and properly placed on the belly of the\r\nsow. Not only is this necessary to ensure the rearing of a fairly\r\nnumerous litter of pigs in a satisfactory manner, but it is held that\r\nthe number of teats possessed by a sow indicates to a remarkable extent\r\nthe probable degree of prolificacy of the sow. One can readily\r\nunderstand that nature would not be likely to endow a sow with the power\r\nto produce a larger number of young at each birth than she would be able\r\nto rear. Of course it may be said that the sow of the present day is not\r\nas nature first made her, in that, by selection and by feeding, the\r\nnumber of pigs produced at each birth is now so much larger than the\r\nlitters of the wild sows, which have some seven or eight teats and\r\nfarrow at each litter a similar number of pigs. On the other hand,\r\nneither the number of teats nor of the young is fixed either in the\r\ndomesticated sow, or the sow in a wild state, so that by continued\r\nselection we are able to permanently increase, within limits, the\r\nproduction of larger litters and the increased supply of milk for their\r\nsustenance when young.\r\n\r\nThe provision of a suitable udder is even of more importance with the\r\ndomesticated than with the sow running wild, since the latter produces\r\neach year one litter only, and that in the season of the year when the\r\nyoung are less dependent on their dams; whereas the domesticated sow is\r\nexpected to rear at least two litters per year, and frequently owing to\r\nwant of care on the part of the owner the young pigs are farrowed at the\r\nmost unfavourable time of the year.\r\n\r\nApart from the provision of a certain number of teats there is another\r\npoint to be considered, the power of the sow to produce milk enough to\r\nsatisfy the given number of pigs. This of course varies with each family\r\nor tribe of pigs, and even with the various members in it, so that to\r\nobtain the best results selection must be made of the produce of those\r\nsows which give the largest quantity of the most nutritious milk. There\r\nexists amongst pig keepers a difference of opinion as to the number of\r\npigs each sow should be allowed to rear, probably the average of this\r\nnumber would be ten for a mature sow, and seven or eight for a first\r\nlitter. If so, the selected sow pig should possess twelve teats, as\r\nfrequently one of these may not give a full supply of milk from either\r\nnatural or accidental causes. The teats should be regular in size and\r\nform. It is not uncommon to find one or more of the teats of a sow much\r\nsmaller in size than the others. These smaller teats will produce a\r\nreduced quantity of milk, so that the pigling which is unfortunate\r\nenough to decide on making this small teat its very own--and each\r\npigling is confined by the others to its own special teat--is certain to\r\nbe less well developed than its brothers and sisters, even if it should\r\nsucceed in surviving.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for the teats being placed equidistant the one from the\r\nother arises from the desirability of each pig having room to suck\r\ncomfortably. Should two of the teats be closely placed the two pigs will\r\nprobably fight, when not only will sores be caused on the cheeks of the\r\npigs, but the milk in the teats not properly drawn will gradually cease\r\nto flow.\r\n\r\nAnother point of great importance is that the teats should commence as\r\nnear as possible to the fore legs--this for two reasons: it gives more\r\nroom for the pigs to suck as they grow larger; the other and more\r\nimportant one is that the teats most forward on the udder of the sow\r\nproduce the larger quantity of milk, or milk of a better quality. It\r\nwill be almost invariably found that the pigs sucking the foremost teats\r\nthrive the best.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable to avoid the selection of a female pig for breeding\r\npurposes from a sow which has large and coarse teats, as these\r\ninvariably accompany coarseness of skin, bone, hair, and flesh, this in\r\nturn affects the sale value of the carcase. It will also be found that\r\nthose sows with a neat and compact udder, with fine teats, will give\r\nmore milk and a better quality than sows possessing a coarse and flabby\r\nudder.\r\n\r\nAnother weakness to be avoided when selecting a sow pig for breeding\r\npurposes is that which is commonly termed a blind teat, since it is\r\nundoubtedly hereditary in addition to being useless for the purpose of\r\nrearing pigs. The normal teat projects boldly from the udder, whereas\r\nthe blind teat is almost flat or on a level with the udder. In\r\nappearance it resembles a ring of skin with a depressed nipple in its\r\ncentre. At the time of parturition the blind teat contains milk to the\r\nsame extent as do the other teats, but it promptly dries up since it is\r\nimpossible for the little pigs to extract the milk from it since the\r\nnipple recedes as soon as the pigling attempts to clasp it with its lips\r\nand tongue, instead of becoming more extended so that the little pig can\r\nsuck the milk from it.\r\n\r\nAn ideal udder can be briefly described as one possessing at least\r\ntwelve fully developed teats, the more the better--these should commence\r\nfrom a point as near the fore legs of the sow as possible, and be placed\r\nas nearly as possible an equal distance the one from the other.\r\n\r\nSome persons hold that large teats and much loose skin are sure\r\nindications that the sow has proved to be a good milker. This is a\r\nmistaken view; it is with sows as with cows, the most prolific milkers\r\nare those with well formed and soft udders which almost disappear when\r\nthe lactation period has passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nMATING THE YOUNG SOW\r\n\r\n\r\nAs in most other details in the management of our domesticated animals\r\nthere exists a variety of opinion as to the age at which the young sow,\r\nor, as it is commonly locally termed, a gilt, yelt, yilt, hilt, elt,\r\netc., should be mated with the boar. Perhaps the most important point to\r\nconsider is the time of the year when the anticipated pigs should\r\narrive. If possible the period between the middle of the month of\r\nSeptember and the middle of December should be avoided. The long nights\r\nand the short and dull days generally experienced during this period are\r\nmost unsuitable for young pigs. Many litters of pigs farrowed in October\r\nare not any larger nor nearly as thrifty in the month of March as those\r\nfarrowed during the early portion of January in the following year, and\r\nvery frequently the loss amongst the October and November farrowed pigs\r\nfrom lameness, or, as it is commonly termed, cramp, is very large. An\r\nattempt should be made so that the two litters which should be bred each\r\nyear from the sow arrive so that they are weaned during the longer and\r\nbrighter days of the year; thus a sow which farrows in the beginning of\r\nFebruary may be expected to farrow again in July. The weather is\r\nsometimes rather cold for little pigs early in the year, but it is\r\nsurprising how little they are affected by it providing the sow\r\nfurnishes a good supply of milk and the bedding is dry and plentiful.\r\nThe pigs farrowed in the months of January and February are generally\r\nthe most profitable, as they will be ready for the consumption of the\r\nseparated milk, butter milk, whey, etc., which is generally abundant in\r\nthe month of May in districts where dairying and cheese making are\r\nfollowed. These pigs are also ready for turning out to grass in April or\r\nMay, or as soon as the weather is suitable, and the grass has grown\r\nsufficiently. These young pigs will grow and thrive splendidly providing\r\nthat some additional food is fed to them and shelter provided.\r\n\r\nThis natural system of pig raising is of great benefit to those pigs\r\nwhich are intended for breeding purposes and was consistently followed\r\nby the writer from the year 1863. It was by no means a new plan even at\r\nthat period, although strange claims have recently been made that the\r\nsystem is a novel one and originated in the fertile brain of one or two\r\nenthusiasts who have gone the whole hog in pig breeding. In the middle\r\nof the last century it was quite a common practice in parts of the\r\ncounties of Cambridge, Essex, and Suffolk to graze the seeds which\r\ncomprised clovers, trefoils, etc., with pigs which received in addition\r\nextra food, such as peas or beans in accordance with the amount of\r\nvegetable food obtainable or the purpose for which the pigs were\r\nrequired; those intended for pork receiving the larger supply.\r\n\r\nAlthough it may not be possible to allow the young boar pigs to have\r\ntheir liberty after they become five months old, yet the sow pigs will\r\ngrow and develop far better in the field if properly fed than they will\r\nin an inclosed sty; further, the young pigs which they produce will be\r\nmuch more lusty than if the sows had been kept in close confinement.\r\n\r\nAlthough the sow pig will generally come in heat when she is about six\r\nmonths old, it is advisable that she should not be mated until she is\r\nsome eight months old, so that her first litter of pigs is not farrowed\r\nuntil she is about a year old, when she should be quite strong enough to\r\nrear a fair litter of pigs and also to grow and develop into a fully\r\nnatured specimen of its breed.\r\n\r\nIn some districts where the breeding pigs are generally kept in\r\nconfinement and high keeping is followed the sow pigs are mated with the\r\nboar at an earlier age, but the system has its disadvantages which more\r\nthan outweigh the saving of the extra few weeks of the keep of the yelt\r\nere she is put to the boar. This early mating is especially harmful if\r\nthe number of the pigs in the first litter should be large. So few pig\r\nkeepers have the hardihood to knock a certain portion of the too\r\nnumerous litter on the head, and so reduce the number to say seven or\r\neight, which most young sows should be able to rear fairly well and\r\nwithout any undue drain on the sow's system--but the whole of the large\r\nlitter are left on the sow, which becomes very much reduced in\r\ncondition, and checked in growth, whilst the too large litter of pigs\r\nare badly reared and frequently become a source of trouble and\r\nannoyance to the owner.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are many practical pig keepers who make it a\r\nrule to delay the mating of their young sows beyond the eight months'\r\nage. They contend that a sow pig at eight months is not sufficiently\r\nmatured to bear the strain of producing a litter of pigs when she is\r\nabout one year old, and then to furnish the pigs with a sufficiency of\r\nmilk to give them a good start in life. The plan which they adopt is to\r\nmate the sow when she is about a year old so that she is some sixteen\r\nmonths old before her family troubles commence.\r\n\r\nAnother very curious reason has been recently made public by an\r\nenthusiastic novice for delaying the mating of the yelt until she is at\r\nleast a year old. It is the following, that it is quite possible to\r\nensure that the produce of young sows which have reached the age of\r\nsixteen or seventeen months ere they farrow their first litter shall\r\npossess the desired characteristics of the breed, whereas this is by no\r\nmeans certain if the young pigs arrive before the sow has reached that\r\nage or is about a year old. Unfortunately, we have see no attempt made\r\nto account for this alleged curious variation in the qualities inherited\r\nfrom a parent of about one year old and the parent which had arrived at\r\nthe more matured age of about sixteen months, so that it is impossible\r\nto discover a solution of the strange problem.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we should be unable to admit the correctness of the assertion\r\neven though it was not directly in opposition to our belief which is\r\nfounded on experience of a most extensive character extending over some\r\nsixty years. To aver that the power of a young sow to impress its\r\nhereditary characteristics on its young are only fully developed by\r\ndeferring the arrival of the young pigs for four or five months, or\r\nuntil the sow is sixteen instead of twelve months old when she farrows\r\nmust surely cause surprise, if not, disbelief. Perhaps the object of the\r\npropounder of the theory was to create a discussion--it could not have\r\nbeen to bring his name prominently before the public.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage in mating the young sow so that her first litter\r\nappears when she is about a year old, her daughters will in turn farrow\r\nduring the most suitable months of the year, providing of course that\r\nshe herself had been farrowed in early spring or about the month of\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\nWhen the sow pig which is intended to be kept for breeding has been\r\nfarrowed in some other part of the year, it is advisable to defer beyond\r\nthe eight months the mating of her so that she farrows at the best\r\ntimes, or perhaps even better than that, if the pigs are not intended\r\nfor breeding purposes, would it be to have the sow mated when she is\r\nabout eight months old, and then allow the pigs to remain on the sow a\r\nfew weeks beyond the usual period of eight weeks so that the pigs are\r\ntaken off the sow three or four days before it is desired to have her\r\nagain mated with the boar. The risk of the sow returning to the boar\r\nwill be minimised, as a sow which has been baulked is sometimes\r\ndifficult to settle. In addition, the sow will be stronger and more\r\nvigorous and likely to produce a strong litter of pigs, whilst the\r\npiglings will scarcely miss their mother's milk when they are weaned\r\nfrom her.\r\n\r\nThose pig breeders who are in favour of withholding the boar from the\r\nyoung sow until she is about a year old aver that early mating results\r\nin the sow becoming worn out and useless for breeding at a much younger\r\nage than if she be not mated until she is well matured. This is not in\r\naccordance with the writer's experience, as many of his sows which\r\nfarrowed their first litter when they were about a year old continued to\r\nbreed regularly until they were six or seven years old--indeed, one\r\nMiddle White, Holywell Victoria Countess farrowed her last litter when\r\nshe was in her eleventh year. This sow also disproved the confident\r\nassertion that the showing of sows renders them comparatively useless\r\nfor breeding purposes, since she not only continued to rear her pigs\r\nwell, but she produced a number of most successful prize winning boars\r\nand sows, and also won many prizes herself from the age of five months\r\nto five years.\r\n\r\nThe principal cause of premature old age amongst sows is not due to\r\ntheir being first mated when they are eight months old, but to the want\r\nof care in the management and feeding of the sow during her pregnancy\r\nand whilst she is suckling her litter of pigs. To a sow with a good\r\nconstitution the act of breeding and rearing a family of pigs is only\r\nthe most important act of nature which cannot be harmful to her,\r\nproviding that she received that amount of proper food and attention\r\nwhich nature required.\r\n\r\nThere may be very occasional instances of harm being done to the\r\nbreeding sow by over feeding, or rather by injudicious feeding, but in\r\ncomparison there are hundreds of instances where under feeding and\r\nneglect are the cause of trouble and loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE FARROWING SOW\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pregnant sow usually carries her pigs about sixteen weeks. The\r\nvariations are neither great nor numerous, when they do occur it is\r\nusually with sows with their first litters or aged sows which sometimes\r\nfarrow ere the full time has expired, or with robust sows in good\r\ncondition which occasionally carry their young beyond the one hundred\r\nand twelve days which may be taken as the average period.\r\n\r\nWe assume that each owner of a breeding sow keeps a record of the date\r\nof service of the sow in order that the necessary preparation of the\r\nsty, etc., can be made in readiness for the arrival of the expected\r\nlitter. Even when this wise precaution is neglected nature gives a\r\nsufficient warning to the observant owner. Apart from the increasing\r\nsize of the body, the udder gradually becomes more prominent, and each\r\npap becomes more defined, the vulva becomes enlarged and the muscles on\r\neither side of the tail fall away and lose their tenseness, whilst in\r\nthe vast majority of cases milk appears in the udder some twelve hours\r\nbefore the arrival of the pigs. The teats shine and become more\r\nprominent, the presence of milk is easily ascertained by gently\r\npressing the teat between the finger and thumb.\r\n\r\nAnother certain indication of the early arrival of a family is the act\r\nof the sow carrying straw about in her mouth wherewith to make her\r\nfarrowing bed.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief causes of trouble with the farrowing sow arises from\r\nthe sow not having been allowed to take sufficient exercise. Of course,\r\nthe best of all systems is to allow the sow its complete freedom at all\r\nseasons of the year save when she is within about a fortnight of her\r\ntime, and when she is rearing a litter of pigs. Even if there be no\r\ngrass field or paddock in which she is able to pick up a good portion of\r\nher living, or a roadside where she can get a few blades of grass, an\r\nopen yard is infinitely better than the confinement of a sty, as apart\r\nfrom the reduction in the cost of keep, the sow will produce stronger\r\npigs, and have a decidedly easier time of farrowing.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a sow showing a disinclination to take a sufficiency of\r\nexercise either owing to laziness, to high condition, or heaviness of\r\nbody, it is advisable to exercise her by walking her about quietly for a\r\nshort time each morning and evening before and after the heat of the day\r\nhas become excessive, or has passed off.\r\n\r\nThere is a difference of opinion amongst pig breeders as to the\r\ndesirability or the reverse of having someone in attendance on the sow\r\nduring the time she is farrowing. Those who object to this procedure do\r\nso on the ground that the presence of a man simply tends to irritate the\r\nsow, and to frequently cause her to become restless, with the result\r\nthat the little pigs are trodden upon or become laid upon and killed.\r\nThis view is generally held by those who are not particularly fond of\r\nanimals, as evidenced by that occasional intercourse between pig and\r\nowner which consists of rubbing the head of the pig, or scratching its\r\nside, when in response to the pleasant sensation it rolls over on to its\r\nside like Oliver and asks for more. The trouble if any, which arises\r\nfrom the owner or pig man being in the sty with the farrowing sow almost\r\ninvariably arises from the absence of a sympathetic feeling between the\r\ntwo. Sows, and indeed wellnigh all animals, pine for sympathy and\r\ncompany, and no animal more so than a pig. Still there are very\r\noccasional instances where the young sow becomes very excitable as she\r\ncommences to farrow even when she and her owner or attendant have\r\npreviously been on the best of terms. But there the cause is not the\r\npresence of a human being, but the arrival of one of her own little\r\npigs. So long as the pigling remains quiet there is peace, but as soon\r\nas the youngster endeavours to get to the teat and especially if in the\r\nendeavour it utters a cry or a squeak, the young sow will jump up from\r\nher nest and endeavour to seize the youngster in her mouth, when unless\r\nprevented the sow quickly squeezes all life out of the pig; and in some\r\ncases when the pressure has been so severe as to break the skin of the\r\npiglet, and the sow tastes blood, she will proceed to eat the dead pig.\r\nWhen affairs have arrived at this sad state, the chances of the\r\nremaining pigs having a pleasant reception into the world are\r\ncomparatively slight.\r\n\r\nWhen there exists a good understanding between the sow and attendant, as\r\nthere invariably is when the latter is not rough and unkind, as only bad\r\ntempered men can be, the trouble in a case such as just referred to is\r\ngreatly reduced, as the attendant runs no risk in entering the sty and\r\nin removing the little pigs as they arrive, and placing them in a hamper\r\nor box partially filled with straw until such time as the sow has\r\ncompleted her farrowing, when the pigs can be placed against the sow's\r\nudder, and providing they do not bite her, all will settle down in peace\r\nand comfort.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid the slightest risk of trouble it is advisable when the\r\npigs are apart from the sow to break off with a pair of pliers the four\r\nlittle teeth with which the pigs are endowed prior to their birth. Care\r\nbeing taken to remove the pigs beyond the hearing of the sow each little\r\npig in turn is tucked under the left arm, the mouth is opened by the\r\nleft hand, and the teeth pressed hard with the pliers, or even a slight\r\nturn of the wrist given, when necessary, and the brittle teeth are\r\ncrushed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the placenta or afterbirth is ejected this should be removed.\r\nA little slop food should be fed to the sow, and whilst she is eating\r\nit, the wettest part of the bedding should be replaced by a little short\r\nand dry straw just enough to render the nest comfortable for the little\r\npigs. The nest should be disturbed as little as possible, as should the\r\nwhole of it be removed and fresh straw given, the sow will probably\r\nspend a considerable time in remaking the nest, and in the meantime the\r\nlittle pigs will be in danger from a chill, or in being mixed up in the\r\nstraw and being laid upon. The risk from delay in the sow laying down\r\nand suckling her pigs is much greater in cold weather, as not only will\r\nthey become chilled, but they will persist in crowding round the sow and\r\nso run the greater risk of being trodden upon, or rolled up in the\r\nbedding in the effort of the sow to remake her comfortable nest.\r\n\r\nSome persons strongly recommend the giving of a strong dose of medicine\r\nto the sow after she has farrowed. In ordinary cases this is not\r\nnecessary, the farrowing of a litter of pigs is a simple and natural\r\noperation. In those occasional instances where manual assistance has to\r\nbe given to the sow owing to the unusual size of the pig, or wrong\r\npresentation, or even of a pig which has been dead for a day or two and\r\nhas begun to decompose and consequently to increase in bulk, it is\r\nadvisable to give medicine to the sow, since there is every probability\r\nof some amount of inflammation due to the insertion of the hand. As the\r\nsow's bowels are likely to be somewhat constipated it is always\r\nadvisable to exercise her for a few minutes during the morning after she\r\nhas farrowed. In most cases the exercise will at once cause her to\r\nrelieve her bowels and her bladder, when she can be returned to her sty.\r\n\r\nWe found sharps, or the finest portion of miller's offals (which usually\r\ngo by varying names in different parts of the country), the most\r\nsuitable food for newly farrowed sows, and until the pigs were at least\r\nfour weeks old. Some persons recommend that a portion of the food should\r\nconsist of bran, this on two grounds--the first that its use tends to\r\nprevent constipation, and secondly on account of the food analysis which\r\nit gives. Our experience has been that when sharps are fed to the sow no\r\ntrouble should arise from constipation, whilst as to the nutriment which\r\nbran contains the claim may be good, but the pig is unable to extract\r\nit; so large a proportion of the bran passes through the pig in an\r\nundigested condition. As a rule the pig, unlike the horse, cow, or\r\nsheep, does not masticate its food, nor does it, like the two last\r\nnamed, chew its cud, but it usually bolts its food, and thus casts a\r\ngreater labour on its digestive organs which have neither the time nor\r\npower to extract the whole of the nutriment from the bran. In addition\r\nto this, bran tends to too great looseness of the bowels, which in the\r\ncase of young pigs tends to become diarrh[oe]a.\r\n\r\nThere is a tendency on the part of some pigmen who are over anxious to\r\nsucceed to feed the sow too large a quantity of food during the first\r\nten days or so after she has farrowed. During this period the demand on\r\nthe sow is really not much greater than it was during the last two or\r\nthree weeks of carrying the pigs. As the pigs grow older an increased\r\nsupply of food is necessary, but for a week or two after the arrival of\r\nthe pigs twice feeding of the sow should suffice unless she is very low\r\nin condition, or a very large litter of pigs is left on her. In such\r\ncases it may be advisable to feed her three times per day just as much\r\nas she will promptly clear up. It is a great mistake to give so much\r\nfood at one time that a portion is left over in the trough,\r\nparticularly is this so when the pigs are over three weeks old, as\r\nnothing so quickly upsets the stomachs of the youngsters as sour food.\r\nIf in ordinary cases feeding the sow three times daily is persisted in,\r\nthe same quantity of food given should simply be distributed over the\r\nthree feedings, as an excess of food is only less a mistake than\r\nunderfeeding.\r\n\r\nThree of the most common troubles with young pigs are diarrh[oe]a, fits,\r\nand loss of the tail. There is a belief amongst many old pigmen that\r\nevery litter of pigs is bound to have at least one attack of diarrh[oe]a\r\nere it is weaned. They look upon it as a fatality which is certain to\r\neventuate, no matter what steps may be taken. Of course, this is folly.\r\nThe liability of little pigs to an attack of what is commonly called\r\nscouring is great as the causes are several, amongst them the greatest\r\nis perhaps a chill which may arise from draughts owing to faulty\r\nconstruction of the sty doors or ventilators neglected; insufficient,\r\nunsuitable, or damp bedding; neglect of proper sanitation, or the\r\nfrequent cleaning out of the sty; and most frequently of all from\r\ninjudicious feeding of the sow. In fact, anything which affects the\r\nhealth of the young pig to any great extent appears to result in\r\nindigestion, which causes constipation, and this in turn nature\r\nendeavours to remove by a special effort which softens the faeces\r\nsomewhat. On removal of the cause of the constipation, the bowels\r\nperform their duty normally, but if this be not removed the result is\r\ndiarrh[oe]a, which again if continued for any length of time often\r\nbecomes dysentery, when the fever is acute; the pigling neglects its\r\nmother's teat, and instead sucks up any moisture however foul which it\r\ncan find in the sty. This is almost invariably a precursor of death.\r\n\r\nFrom the above it will be gathered that prevention is better than cure.\r\nIn case of an attack, the first thing is to discover the cause, and the\r\nsecond is to remove it, when, generally speaking, the trouble ceases. As\r\na help to this end, depriving the sow of one meal is recommended. Coal,\r\ncinders, or even earth will be readily eaten by the young pigs and prove\r\nof benefit. Medicine is not often required if the steps recommended are\r\npromptly taken.\r\n\r\nIn our earlier days hog's madder was the common medicine used with pigs\r\nfor most ailments, but of late years sulphur appears to have taken its\r\nplace. It is less violent than castor oil, which is apt to cause\r\nconstipation of the bowels after its first effect has passed off.\r\n\r\nThe soreness of the tails, which if not attended to generally results in\r\nthe pig becoming bob-tailed, appears most generally in damp and cold\r\nweather, and is the result of impaired circulation of the blood. The\r\ncure is simple. The application of fat or oil as soon as the tail\r\nbecomes red and cold, twice per day, and continued for two or three days\r\nwill almost always result in a cure. For some years we used\r\nboro-glyceride, a compound, we believe, of boracic acid and glycerine,\r\nbut we are not certain that it is now procurable.\r\n\r\nThe third of the common troubles of the young pig is fits of an\r\napoplectic and epileptic character. As a rule the shortest, thickest,\r\nand fattest pigs of the litter are those which are affected. This\r\npoints to the chief cause, too much food in the form of mother's milk. A\r\nreduction in the quantity of the food fed to the sow will generally be\r\neffectual, except when the pigs are old enough to eat. Then both the\r\nquantity and the quality of the food given to them should be reduced.\r\nPrompt removal of the cause is usually sufficient, but it may be\r\nnecessary to mix a little medicine in the food in persistent cases, or\r\nwhen remedial measures are not promptly taken. The ordinary symptoms are\r\nunmistakable, the pig falls on its side, struggles and gasps for breath,\r\nthen in a minute or two it rises and appears to be little the worse.\r\nUnless continued over a period, fits are not usually fatal.\r\n\r\nVery occasionally young pigs suffer from the protrusion of the rectum,\r\nor as it is commonly termed \"shooting of the gut.\" This is due to\r\nvarious causes which result in straining. Of these constipation and\r\ndiarrh[oe]a are the two most common. As soon as the protrusion of the\r\ngut is noticeable, the enlargement should be carefully washed, then\r\noiled and gently pressed back into its natural position. Some pigmen\r\nadvise the dusting of flour on to the protruded portion before it is\r\nreturned, but there is a risk of increasing the amount of inflammation\r\nwhich is generally present. If known the original cause of the trouble\r\nshould be removed, but in any case it is advisable not to give any solid\r\nfood to the pig for two or three days after the operation.\r\n\r\nStill another of the troubles to which pig flesh is heir is hernia, or\r\nrupture. This is of two kinds, umbilical and scrotum. The former is\r\nthe escape of a portion of the bowels through an imperfectly closed\r\nnavel opening, whilst the latter shows itself in an enlargement of the\r\nscrotum or purse due to an escape into it of a portion of the abdominal\r\ncontents. Both of these ailments are considered to be hereditary, but\r\nthe most common and the most troublesome is the latter, since there is\r\nalways a chance of strangulation of the escaped portions, which nearly\r\nalways results in death.\r\n\r\nAt one time it was considered to be inadvisable to castrate the boar\r\npigs affected, but of late years the plan has been adopted of making\r\nonly one incision in the scrotum in place of two, and making that one as\r\nhigh as possible. Then after the operation is performed, the aperture is\r\nsown up. The pig should be fed lightly for a day or two in order to give\r\ntime for the healing of the wound.\r\n\r\nUmbilical hernia is not generally of much importance, the navel opening\r\ngradually closes as the pig grows stronger and the enlargement\r\ndisappears. It is advisable not to breed from a sow pig which has been\r\naffected, nor to continue to use a boar which has begotten ruptured\r\npigs, as both failings are hereditary.\r\n\r\nFor a time at least, there is certain to be a difficulty in obtaining a\r\nfull supply of sharps, even of the greatly reduced feeding value of the\r\npresent quantity available. It may, therefore, be advisable to refer to\r\nanother system of feeding the suckling sow and the young pigs. It is now\r\nperforce being generally adopted, but the result is not generally\r\nconsidered to be equal to the old system recommended. It is that of\r\nfeeding pigs of the kind mentioned on vegetable food, and a mixture of\r\npalm nut, cocoa nut, ground nut, or linseed cake. The proportions fed at\r\nthe Cambridge University Farm are mangolds 20 lbs.; a mixture of two\r\nparts palm nut cake, and one part cocoa nut cake, 2 lbs.; linseed cake,\r\n2 lbs.; and ground nut cake, 1 lb. The two former were fed in the\r\nmorning and evening, and the other two at midday. The various cakes seem\r\nto have been fed in a dry condition, but other pig feeders have found it\r\nbeneficial to soak the cake in water for some twelve hours. This view\r\nseems to have received support from the practice at Cambridge, which was\r\nto mix the cake with the cut mangolds twenty-four hours before being fed\r\nto the pigs so that at least a portion of the cake would become softened\r\nby the mangold juice. Almost any kind of vegetable matter containing a\r\nfair amount of nutrition would be equally as suitable as mangold, indeed\r\nmore so during the period from October to April. In the winter months\r\ncooked potatoes; kohl rabi, swedes, parsnips, cabbages, artichokes,\r\netc., fed raw; and in the summer grass, lucerne, clover, vetches, rape,\r\nor almost any kind of vegetable food will be readily eaten by the pigs.\r\nEven where the wasteful practice of peeling the potatoes before being\r\ncooked for the household is still followed (and just how wasteful this\r\nold-fashioned plan is has been lately proved to be a loss of nearly one\r\nquarter of the nutriment)--it is advisable to boil the parings and then\r\nmix the whole with the pig's food.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be too strongly impressed on pig keepers that a certain\r\nproportion of vegetable food is most beneficial for pigs of all ages, as\r\nnot only is a saving in cost effected, but the pigs will continue in a\r\nmore healthy condition than when fed solely on meal or other\r\nconcentrated food.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LARGE WHITE BOAR.

This practice varies greatly in different districts,\r\nand even in the same district where one would naturally suppose that the\r\ndetermining influences would be similar weaning at five or six weeks\r\nold.\r\n\r\nOne pig breeder will declare that a little pig of five or six weeks old\r\nshould be and is able to support itself alone, and will act accordingly.\r\nShould perchance a litter weaned thus early cease to grow the excuses\r\nmade will be various.\r\n\r\nThe weather is at fault, it is either too hot or too cold, or the\r\nsharps, etc., on which they have been fed were not good or sweet, that\r\nthe sow's milk was not sufficiently plentiful, or it was wanting in\r\nnutriment. In fact, any excuse will be made rather than the actual cause\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\nIn far too many instances the real reason for the want of thrift on the\r\npart of the young pigs taken from their mother when they are not more\r\nthan five or six weeks old is that their digestive organs are not\r\nsufficiently developed as to enable them to digest enough food to\r\nnourish them properly.\r\n\r\nAnother excuse often made for what we consider to be undue haste in\r\nweaning young pigs is the alleged desire of the owner not to waste the\r\ntime of the sow. He is anxious to have her served again and hasten the\r\narrival of the next litter.\r\n\r\nOccasionally it is found to be unnecessary to wean the pigs for this\r\npurpose as the sow will come in heat and can be served by the boar, but\r\nif she should become in pig the result will be much the same so far as\r\nthe pigs are concerned, since as soon as the sow has conceived the milk\r\nwill promptly cease or become very reduced in quantity and quality.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the sow does not stand to the boar time may be\r\nwasted. It is most unlikely that the sow will again become in heat for\r\nsome three weeks, whereas this almost always occurs within a few days of\r\nthe weaning of the litter of pigs.\r\n\r\nThen another extreme, and one which is practised by some pig breeders,\r\nis to allow the young pigs to remain on the sow until the former are\r\nfrom ten to twelve weeks old. It is claimed for this practice that the\r\nyoung pigs grow much faster when left on the sow than when weaned, and\r\nthat less food is consumed for a live weight increase from a given\r\nquantity of food. Also, it is said that food of more inferior kind can\r\nbe fed to the sow than could be fed to the pigs if they were weaned, and\r\nthus the sow and litter are kept at less expense, and that if the pigs\r\nare not weaned until nearly three months, the milk of the sow will have\r\ngradually ceased to flow, and the pigs will not miss the help from\r\ntheir dam. Their digestive organs will then have become sufficiently\r\ndeveloped to enable them to make the best use of the food given to them,\r\nand they will sustain no check in thrift or growth when they are weaned.\r\n\r\nIn this question of weaning pigs the good old fashioned plan of\r\nfollowing the middle course will probably be found to be the best.\r\nAnyway, it was the one which we followed for a great number of years and\r\nfound the results generally satisfactory for the following among other\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\nAs a breeder of pure bred pigs for sale as boars or yelts for breeding\r\npurposes, we were naturally anxious to give the pigs a good start in\r\nlife so that we should be able to sell them as quickly as possible, and\r\nthat they should thrive when they came into the possession of their new\r\nowners, and thus prove the best possible advertisement of our herds. As\r\na rule we found that if the pigs were allowed to remain on the sows\r\nuntil they were some eight weeks old they were quite strong enough to\r\nfend for themselves, that by gradually increasing the length of time\r\nwhich the sow was allowed to remain from the pigs, the latter became\r\naccustomed to exist without the mother's milk, and as the milk of the\r\nsow naturally dried up when the pigs partially ceased to withdraw it, no\r\ntrouble was experienced with inflamed udders as is usually or commonly\r\nthe case when the pigs are suddenly weaned from a sow which is in full\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nThere is also another advantage apart from that to the sow and pigs, it\r\nis that the sow will almost invariably come in heat within three or\r\nfour days of the weaning, and with the best possible chance of becoming\r\nin pig.\r\n\r\nSome pig keepers are more inclined to wean their litter of pigs at an\r\nearly age, and then if the sow be low in condition to baulk her at the\r\nfirst time of [oe]strum. There are objections to this--one of them is\r\nthat there is frequently a difficulty in getting the sow to conceive\r\nafter she has been baulked. Why this should be so we have not been able\r\nto ascertain. We only record what we know to be a fact.\r\n\r\nIn our opinion this difficulty is one of the strongest points in favour\r\nof the practice of allowing the young pigs of a sow with her first\r\nlitter, or of an old sow which has become low in condition (either from\r\nhaving had too many pigs left on her, or from other natural cause), to\r\nremain on the sow for a longer period than about eight weeks. Some\r\npersons will keep the pigs on the sow until they are nearly three months\r\nold in the belief that both sow and pigs are benefited, and that the\r\npigs can be kept quite as cheaply if not more so when unweaned than\r\nweaned. They also claim that the sow is so much stronger and better\r\nfitted to prepare for another litter. Experiments have been carried out\r\nin the United States which go far to prove that the first of these two\r\nclaims is founded on fact; and it has further been demonstrated that\r\ncertain foods can be fed to the sow without affecting the thrift and\r\nhealth of the pigs which could not with safety be fed to the latter\r\ndirect, yet when fed through the sow the pigs will thrive on the milk\r\nproduced therefrom. It is entirely a question of the cost of a rest for\r\nthe sow during the extra two or three weeks, and the benefit to the\r\nsow and her pigs.\r\n\r\nOne occasionally sees in the press a claim for what is considered to be\r\na great achievement in that some one has bred three litters of pigs from\r\none sow within the year. There really is something wonderful in this\r\nsince of the fifty-two weeks constituting a year, the sow would be\r\ncarrying her pigs some forty-eight weeks. This would allow only four\r\nweeks for the two litters of pigs to be suckled, and this would also\r\ninclude the few days between the pigs being weaned and the sow coming in\r\nheat. Apart from the natural difficulty of successfully breeding three\r\nlitters of pigs from one sow within twelve months, there exists a far\r\ngreater possibility of loss rather than of gain from unduly hurrying on\r\nthe arrival of each litter of pigs from a sow, especially of the\r\nprofitable kind of sow.\r\n\r\nSome forty years since when Small Whites, Small Blacks, and short thick\r\nBerkshires were fashionable, the number of pigs in each litter was few,\r\nand the number reared still fewer, owing to the limited quantity of milk\r\nfurnished by the sow. Now, the Large Black, the Large White, the Middle\r\nWhite, the Lincolnshire Curly Coat, the old Gloucester Spots, the\r\nTamworth, the Cumberland, and even the sows of most of the local breeds\r\nof pigs are expected to rear nine or ten pigs each litter. Even if it\r\nwere possible for a sow to bring forth three litters within the year,\r\nshe could not possibly do justice to them either before or after the\r\npiglings arrived in this world; and further, the life of such a sow\r\nwould of necessity be a short one. It must not be forgotten that in\r\nthe production of each litter of pigs the sow is compelled to\r\nmanufacture from 20 to 30 lbs. of flesh, skin, hair, etc., which\r\ntogether constitute the newly farrowed pig, and very frequently this has\r\nto be accomplished on a far too limited supply of suitable food.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a Painting by Wippell._\r\n\r\nMIDDLE WHITE SOW.\r\n\r\nTo face page 96.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Block kindly supplied by Cumberland Pig Breeders'\r\nAssociation, Carlisle._\r\n\r\nCUMBERLAND SOW.\r\n\r\nOwned by Mr. Carr, Kirkbride, Carlisle.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE REARING OF YOUNG PIGS\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most important points in the profitable raising of stock is\r\nto give the animals a good start in their earliest days. There is an old\r\nand true saying amongst shepherds that the best and most profitable\r\nsheep are those which have never lost their lamb fat. It may with equal\r\ntruth be declared that the most profitable pig is the one which has a\r\ngood start when on its mother, and never afterwards lacks suitable food,\r\njudiciously given.\r\n\r\nAt frequent intervals, the question as to the number of pigs which a sow\r\nshould have left on her to rear is the subject of discussion in the\r\npress. At each of these periods very similar arguments for and against\r\nlarge litters are used with much the same inconclusive results. This\r\nprobably arises to a great extent from the varying conditions under\r\nwhich the particular litter of pigs is to be reared. The time of year\r\nhas a vast influence, a sow farrowing in May will more successfully rear\r\na dozen pigs than she would bring up ten if they were farrowed in the\r\nmonth of October.\r\n\r\nThe age and condition of the sow should also be considered. A young sow\r\nof about twelve months should not have more than seven or eight pigs\r\nleft on her to rear, whereas with her succeeding litters until she is at\r\nleast four years old she would rear at least ten pigs each litter. After\r\nthe sow has reached the age of about four years, if that time has been\r\nfully employed in her maternal duties, she becomes gradually less able\r\nto rear so large a number of pigs with an equal amount of success. It is\r\nthen advisable to vary the number according to the season, and to the\r\nphysical condition of the sow; generally speaking an aged sow will bring\r\nup more pigs in the summer months than in the colder months.\r\n\r\nReference is made elsewhere to the manner in which the young pigs should\r\nbe cared for until they are weaned from their dam, but no harm can arise\r\nfrom a repetition of the advice that the young pigs should be so managed\r\nand fed that only the very slightest difference will be noticed by the\r\nyoungsters when parted from their mother. Many pigs are permanently\r\nchecked in growth by being suddenly deprived of a full supply of\r\nmother's milk if weaned when their digestive organs are insufficiently\r\ndeveloped as to treat a sufficiency of food to make growth and progress\r\nwithout the assistance received from their mother's milk.\r\n\r\nOpinions differ as to the age at which little pigs are sufficiently\r\ndeveloped as to exist and thrive without their dam's help. Here again\r\nthe time of the year, not only as far as the weather is concerned, but\r\nthe desirability of prompt or deferred remating of the sow in order that\r\nher succeeding litters should arrive during the most favourable portions\r\nof the year, must be considered. The thrift and growth of each litter\r\nof pigs varies greatly. The health of the sow, her condition before\r\nfarrowing, and other causes, some of which are not always on the\r\nsurface, have their influence, but it may be taken as a rule that young\r\npigs are fully able to fend for themselves by the time they are eight\r\nweeks old. Should it be possible to allow the pigs to remain on the sow\r\nfor so long a time as twelve weeks without prejudicing the next litters\r\nas to the time of year of their arrival, the pigs may benefit, and no\r\nloss of food will be sustained, since it has been clearly proved that\r\npigs beyond the age of eight weeks can be fed quite as economically, if\r\nnot more so, on the sow than if weaned. It may also be possible to feed\r\nthe sow on somewhat coarser and less expensive food than could be\r\nsatisfactorily fed to the young pigs, as her digestive organs would be\r\nbetter able to treat the coarser food. Another advantage generally\r\nfollows keeping the pigs for a longer time on the sow if the latter be\r\nwell fed is that she will be in a stronger and better condition to start\r\nthe building up of her next litter.\r\n\r\nAs a rule young pigs will commence to eat when they are from three to\r\nfour weeks old. If the sow is fed in the sty in which the little pigs\r\nare, these will endeavour to share in the food; at first they may\r\ncontent themselves with licking any food which may be outside the\r\ntrough, but they quickly show a desire for more, and attempt to get into\r\nthe trough. When this is evident, it is advisable to feed the little\r\npigs apart from the sow; a low flat trough is best, as one with high\r\nsides is said to cause \"high backed\" pigs, or pigs suffering from a\r\ncurvature of the spine. If a little milk can be obtained, the pigs will\r\npromptly drink it, if the milk be whole they will thrive best, but even\r\nif only skim or separated milk be obtainable, or butter milk, providing\r\nthat it be drawn off ere the salt is put into the churn, a small\r\nquantity will be beneficial, but the pigs will not be able to digest so\r\nlarge a quantity of the separated as of the whole milk. The former is\r\napt to have a constipating effect on the bowels of the youngsters.\r\nShould an ample supply of separated milk be available it can be fed\r\nthrough the sow, who will be better able to digest it, and whose yield\r\nof milk will be increased, provided that sufficient separated milk to\r\naffect her bowels be not given to her. A few kernels of wheat or white\r\npeas will be readily eaten by the little pigs, which will benefit\r\ntherefrom.\r\n\r\nIf no other food is available, sharps, or whatever the local term for\r\nthe finer miller's offals may be, mixed with a little warm water and fed\r\nto the piglings, will prove beneficial, care being taken to give only so\r\nmuch as the pigs will eat up readily, or that any surplus is taken away,\r\nso that it does not become sour, as in this last condition it will cause\r\ndiarrh[oe]a in the young pigs.\r\n\r\nWhen the pigs are about six weeks old the sow can be allowed to remain\r\nfrom them for a longer time, and the youngsters fed two or three times\r\neach day. The sow's milk will then gradually dry up, and the pigs will\r\nbecome accustomed to the food, so that when the latter are about eight\r\nweeks old they will have become weaned naturally, and receive no check\r\nfrom the loss of the sow's milk. This system, will also prevent any\r\ntrouble arising from the collection of milk in the sow's udder, and the\r\noccasional attacks of inflammation or garget which follow a chill to the\r\nsow when her udder is in an inflamed condition from being closely\r\nimpacted with milk.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the economical and beneficial practice of supplying the\r\nsuckling sow with vegetable food of some kind after the pigs are some\r\nthree or four weeks old has been adopted, the pigs will have become\r\naccustomed to its consumption. It will be found to be advisable to\r\ncontinue this whether it has taken the form of cooked potatoes, of\r\nmangolds, swedes, kohl rabi, cabbages, artichokes, etc., as not only\r\nwill the food bill be reduced, as the pigs will make equal growth and\r\nthrift on food containing say ten per cent of vegetable matter as they\r\nwill if fed wholly on sharps, but the vegetable food will have a\r\nbeneficial effect on the health of the pigs, and tend to prevent those\r\nattacks of constipation and diarrh[oe]a which are so frequently the\r\nresult of food of too rich a character.\r\n\r\nOf the vegetable foods, cooked potatoes and raw artichokes are the most\r\nnourishing and the most readily eaten, lucerne and clover in a green\r\nstate come next in food value and favouritism with the pigs; cabbages\r\nare credited with causing constipation when fed to young pigs, whilst\r\nmangolds are said to have the opposite effect, and in addition when\r\ngrown on light land by the aid of artificial manure mangolds are apt to\r\naffect the kidneys and cause excessive urination. Kohl rabi are not so\r\nmuch used in the feeding of pigs as would be advisable. They are easily\r\ngrown and will take the place of swedes on land on which swedes are\r\nsubject to mildew; they are very nutritious, and are readily eaten by\r\nboth old and young pigs.\r\n\r\nColeseed is not used in the feeding of pigs in this country to anything\r\napproaching the same extent as in Canada and the United States; its\r\nvalue and results are of a very similar character to those of cabbages.\r\nTares or vetches contain too large a proportion of water for young pigs,\r\nand they also have a tendency to cause looseness of the bowels. The\r\ngrowth of maize for feeding to pigs in a green state has been\r\nrecommended by some writers, but in practice we found it most unsuitable\r\nfor young pigs, and of little value for aged pigs, owing to the small\r\nproportion of nourishment contained in it in comparison with its bulk.\r\nFurther, pigs both old and young will refuse to eat it unless driven by\r\nhunger. It is needless to remark that no pigs, especially young ones,\r\nwill thrive under such conditions.\r\n\r\nOne of the most common mistakes made by pig feeders is allowing too long\r\na time to pass between feeding times. Twice or three times per day is\r\nconsidered to be quite frequent enough, whereas prior to their being\r\nweaned the pigs would have had a meal wellnigh each two hours both day\r\nand night. Infrequent meals result in the pigs becoming so hungry that\r\nthey bolt their food, and a greater quantity than is desirable, and then\r\nsuffer from indigestion.\r\n\r\nIt must also be remembered that the pig's capacity for storing food is\r\nvery small, especially as compared with some others of our domesticated\r\nanimals. Four or five meals per day at least should be given to newly\r\nweaned pigs. That most troublesome of ailments commonly termed cramp\r\nmore generally results from injudicious feeding than from all other\r\ncauses combined. Even when the young pigs are properly fed on suitable\r\nfood there is a tendency in some little pigs to attacks of cramp. One of\r\nthe best preventatives and even remedies is to compel the pigs to leave\r\ntheir nests late in the evening or prior to the pigman retiring for the\r\nnight, as they will then relieve the bowels and bladder. Otherwise,\r\nparticularly in cold weather, the pigs would remain quiescent in their\r\nnests from feeding time in the afternoon until they were fed the\r\nfollowing morning, or in winter a period of some fifteen or sixteen\r\nhours--far too long a time for the good health of the young pigs.\r\n\r\nAnother point which requires attention is the provision of a dry bed.\r\nPigs are naturally clean animals, and will not as a rule foul their bed\r\nwhen they are in a healthy state. Still the straw will in winter time\r\nbecome damp solely from the moisture thrown off by the pigs when huddled\r\ntogether in their nest. All damp litter should be carefully removed at\r\nleast once each day.\r\n\r\nThe best of all materials for the bedding of pigs is wheat straw. This\r\nwill absorb a larger amount of moisture than any other kind of straw,\r\nwhilst the skin and hair of the pigs will remain of a brighter colour\r\nthan if bedded on oat or barley straw. Of these two, the former is more\r\nsuitable than the latter, which so readily becomes damp and foul. In\r\nthose parts of the country where comparatively little corn is grown,\r\nsawdust and wood shavings are commonly used for litter for pigs. So far\r\nas the comfort of the pigs is concerned there is little difference as\r\ncompared with straw with regard to pigs of all ages in the warmer\r\nweather, but in the winter little pigs suffer, as they are unable to\r\nmake the warm nest which straw enables them to make and enjoy.\r\n\r\nWhen peat moss was first introduced it was strongly recommended for the\r\nbedding of pigs. It was claimed for it that it was a far better\r\nabsorbent of moisture than sawdust, and that its manurial value was much\r\ngreater. It is probable that both claims are founded on fact, as sawdust\r\nis of comparatively no value as a manure. But there exists one serious\r\nobjection to the use of peat moss as litter for young pigs. It is that\r\nthe pigs are given to eat it, that it causes severe attacks of\r\nindigestion, and often the death of the pig eating it.\r\n\r\nOf late years the spaying of the sow pigs has ceased to be general. The\r\ncauses of this neglect may be several, amongst them the dislike of\r\ntrouble, but perhaps the main reason is that the so-called store period\r\nof the pig's life is now so much shorter than in the olden days, and\r\nconsequently the loss of food, and the risk of the arrival of unexpected\r\nlitters of pigs are less, from the repeated periods of heat, indeed\r\nunder the present or recent conditions of pig keeping a large\r\nproportion of the pigs are killed ere they have become sufficiently\r\ndeveloped to be troublesome in this respect.\r\n\r\nStill, there is little doubt that the castrating and spaying of young\r\npigs at about the age of six weeks, or before they have been weaned from\r\nthe sow is advisable and the cost of the operation is well repaid. An\r\nunspayed sow pig becomes a nuisance in company with other pigs, and when\r\nit is put up to fatten will make no progress on some three or four days\r\nduring each three weeks when she ordinarily becomes in heat.\r\n\r\nIn addition to her own waste of time she will, if penned with others, be\r\ncontinually worrying her mates and preventing them from resting and\r\nthriving.\r\n\r\nUntil recently another objection was taken to the unspayed sow pig, it\r\nwas that if she were killed during the period of [oe]strum that great\r\ndifficulty would be experienced in curing the meat properly, and that\r\nsigns of her heated condition would be noticed in the mammary glands in\r\nthe form of dark globules of what was considered to be blood, but\r\ninvestigation carried out at the University Farm at Cambridge by Messrs.\r\nRussell and Kenneth Mackensie have proved that the discoloration and the\r\nconsequent loss in value of a certain portion of the belly of a side of\r\nbacon is not due to the pig having been in a state of heat at the time\r\nof its slaughter, but to an excess of pigment, noticeable only amongst\r\ncoloured pigs. Thus, the globules would be of a dark colour when the\r\nbacon was from a pig of a black colour, and red from the pigs of the\r\nTamworth breed. This shows another cause of the marked preference of the\r\nbacon curers for pigs of a white colour in the manufacture of the\r\nhighest priced bacon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nHOUSING OF PIGS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the general management of pigs there are many points on which\r\nimprovements might be effected without any very considerable amount of\r\ntrouble or expense. Far too frequently this neglect or want of care and\r\nthought is observable in the housing of pigs. Many of the sties in the\r\ncountry districts are neither wind nor water tight, and they are far too\r\noften in a most unsanitary condition, indeed in such a disgraceful state\r\nthat some excuse was afforded for the drastic, if injudicious order of\r\nthe sanitary authorities which prohibited the erection of a pigsty\r\nwithin from sixty to one hundred feet of a dwelling house. Undoubtedly\r\nit would have been wiser to have permitted the keeping of pigs within a\r\nmuch shorter distance of the house only so long as the necessary steps\r\nwere taken to prevent a nuisance or a risk of the residents in the house\r\nsuffering in health. The proximity of a pigsty to a house can be\r\nrendered perfectly innocuous with ordinary care, and the cottager not be\r\ndeprived of very considerable advantages not only in making a profit,\r\nbut in the provision of manure for his allotment or garden which will\r\nbenefit greatly from its application.\r\n\r\nThe mistakes or want of care in the erection of pigsties is by no means\r\nconfined to the owners of cottages or small holdings, as a considerable\r\nproportion of the piggeries on which great outlay is expended are\r\nequally as unsuitable if not so insanitary. Even in so-called model\r\nbuildings the piggery has often been the last thing thought of; the\r\nstables, the cow house, etc., have been conveniently placed for feeding\r\nthe occupants, for air, light, and sun, and then the piggery has been\r\nplaced in whatever spot may have been left unoccupied, and as this\r\ngenerally happens to be on the northern side of the buildings, the\r\nunhappy pigs are deprived of the rays of the sun, which are to them\r\nquite as necessary, if not more so, than to any others of our\r\ndomesticated animals.\r\n\r\nThis same want of sun, and the exposure to cold is noticeable in only a\r\nlesser degree in those buildings which comprise a double row of sties\r\nwith a passage down the centre, a store and a cooking and mixing house\r\nat one end, and an exercise or feeding yard adjoining. It matters not\r\nwhether the building be placed north or south, or east or west, one half\r\nof the sties have a wrong aspect; even if the sties facing the west can\r\nbe said to possess one. The trouble is still greater with the system of\r\nhaving a yard attached to each sty. The north or east wind renders the\r\nsties with such an aspect a most uncomfortable and unhealthy place for\r\nyoung pigs during more than half the year, whilst older pigs cannot\r\nthrive on the same amount of food as they would if their quarters were\r\ncomfortable. Apart from the waste of food which results from these\r\ndraughty and cold sties, the latter are the chief cause, with\r\ninjudicious feeding, of that most troublesome ailment amongst pigs,\r\nrheumatic gout, or, as it is commonly termed, cramp. How very draughty\r\nand uncomfortable these sties are which have an open yard attached, and\r\nan inlet at all times usable, can be readily discovered in cold and\r\nwindy weather by noticing the position in which the occupant has made\r\nits bed. This will be found not on the highest part of the sty, which\r\nwill be opposite to the opening into the yard, but in the corner next to\r\nthe opening, since in this position it is less exposed to the cold wind\r\nwhich rushes into the sty through the opening.\r\n\r\nApart from the unhealthiness to the pigs resulting from the exposure to\r\ndraughts it is not apparent to the writer that any advantage is gained\r\nfrom the provision of these yards. In many instances they serve only for\r\nan excuse to limit the height of the sties, as unless these are of a\r\nfair height there is a considerable difficulty in cleaning them out. The\r\nmoney expended on building the yard would easily cover the extra cost of\r\nraising the side walls of the pigsty by two feet, and thus not only\r\nrender it free from draughts, but also make it far more healthy and less\r\nsubject to the extremes of heat and cold.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary sty with a yard attached is unhealthy for a growing or\r\nmatured pig, but in the colder weather it is simply cruel for newly born\r\npigs, of which numbers are annually lost from exposure or are greatly\r\nchecked in their growth.\r\n\r\nOne of the very best places in which to house pigs in the experience of\r\nthe writer was a large barn with a thatched roof. This was divided off\r\ninto sties by partitions some 4 ft. 6 in. high; owing to the height of\r\nthe building the temperature was not unduly high in the hottest weather\r\nnor did the pigs suffer to any extent during severe weather. These\r\nadvantages arose mainly from the slight changes in temperature, and an\r\nabundant supply of uncontaminated air.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest drawbacks to the majority of the pigsties is the\r\nabsence of ventilation without draught. This trouble is especially\r\nnoticeable where the side walls are not more than about 4 ft. high,\r\nwhilst the proximity of the roof to the pigs increases the sufferings of\r\nthe pigs from the heat when the weather is excessively hot.\r\n\r\nSome of our most successful pig feeders on a large scale have found it\r\nprofitable to erect cheap buildings very similar to small barns, the\r\nside walls being at least 10 feet high. This will permit of thorough\r\nventilation, quite free from draughts, whilst the variations in the\r\ntemperature will be comparatively slight. The building being complete\r\nwithin itself, and entirely used for the pigs, there is no disturbance\r\nof the pigs between the feeding times, so that the pigs will rest and\r\ngrow fat. These houses are most suitable for a number of fattening pigs,\r\nwhereas for sows and for young sows smaller sties or houses are more\r\nconvenient. These should be at least 10 ft. square, the front 6 ft. 6\r\nin. high, the doors divided so that the upper half can be opened when\r\nthe weather is favourable; ventilation can be obtained by hanging or\r\nsliding doors just under the eaves so that the pigs are not affected by\r\nthe draught; the floor should be laid with brick and gradually incline\r\nto the front of the building so that the liquid can run through an\r\naperture in the lower part of the front wall into a cesspool placed\r\nclose to the building. A row of these houses, which should face to the\r\nsouth, can be more cheaply erected than a single house, as the wooden\r\npartitions between the houses need not be more than 4 ft. high, and one\r\nof these would take the place of two gables or ends. Several of the\r\nhouses which the writer erected had brick foundations and feather-edged\r\nboarded sides and ends; the roofs were of tiles unpointed, as in this\r\nway the houses were much cooler in the summer, whilst in the winter the\r\nupper portions of the houses were packed with straw which still\r\npermitted of the escape of the foul air, yet greatly added to the warmth\r\nand comfort of the building.\r\n\r\nThe one thing of all others most needful in the sty or house for the\r\nwell doing of pigs is a sufficiency of pure air without draughts; pigs\r\nof even a few days old will suffer less from cold than from moist and\r\nfoul hot air. It is not the most costly building in which pigs will\r\nthrive best, but the one in which they are the most comfortable and free\r\nfrom the extremes of heat and cold with a dry bed on which to rest and\r\nbe thankful.\r\n\r\nWhen making a tour of the Agricultural Experiment Stations and\r\nAgricultural Schools in Denmark some few years since, the writer saw\r\nnear Aarhuss what was then a novelty in the form of a two decker pigsty,\r\ni.e. a sty with a sleeping place above--one could scarcely term it an\r\nupstairs room as access was gained not by stairs but by an inclined\r\nboard with struts of wood fastened across it to give a firm holding to\r\nthe pigs as they ascended to the upper story. The incline was very\r\nsteep, but the pigs seemed to have no difficulty in getting up and down.\r\nThe advantages claimed for it by the principal were that the sleeping\r\ncompartment was so much cleaner and sweeter; that less straw was\r\nrequired for bedding, and that the pigs were far more comfortable and\r\nrested better than when boxed up, especially in the summer season when\r\nthe heat in the lower portion was very oppressive. The feeding took\r\nplace in the lower portion. It was stated that nearly the whole of the\r\nurine and dung was deposited below. This was a great advantage as the\r\nmoisture ran off at once into the drains, and the solids were easily\r\ncleared out as there was no litter mixed with them, or the dung could be\r\nreadily washed into the drains by water from a hose, which was used in\r\nthe summer for the purpose of bathing or of washing the pigs.\r\n\r\nThe chief objection to the plan would be its expense, as unless the\r\npigsties were in a barn or a shed already erected for some other purpose\r\nthe pigsty would have to be so much higher on the side walls and\r\nconsequently more strongly built.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo, Sport and General._\r\n\r\nLARGE WHITE SOW, \"WORSLEY SUNBEAM.\"\r\n\r\nTo face page 112.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo kindly lent by Kenneth MacRae, R.U.A.S., Balmoral,\r\nBelfast._\r\n\r\nLARGE WHITE ULSTER BOAR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE EXHIBITION OF PIGS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the exhibition of live stock at our numerous shows became common, a\r\nbelief sprang up amongst non-exhibitors that the preparation for show\r\nwas most deleterious to the animals shown. It was also contended that\r\nexhibitors were prone to pay attention, to a far greater extent, to the\r\nfancy or show points of the animals which they bred than to those\r\nutility points which are of infinitely more importance to the ordinary\r\nstock breeder and the consumer. It was also believed that the feeding or\r\ntraining which the show stock underwent seriously affected their\r\nprocreative powers, and especially so with the animals of the feminine\r\ngender.\r\n\r\nIt may at once be frankly admitted that there existed some ground for\r\nthe belief that a majority of the exhibitors did appear to give too\r\ngreat attention to the claims of the judges who were, in too many cases,\r\nchosen for reasons other than their knowledge of practical agriculture\r\nor the requirements of the consumers of meat. For so acting, the\r\nexhibitors were not beyond blame, as in the earlier days of showing,\r\ntheir main object was to win prizes in order to advertise their stock\r\nand so secure customers for their spare breeding animals. The actual\r\nimprovement of the various breeds of stock did not in those far-off days\r\nappear to be of such vital importance as the world upheaval, of which\r\nthe present generation has been the witness, has proved it to be.\r\n\r\nIt may also be fairly claimed that there has been some slight\r\nimprovement in the system of feeding and training followed by the pig\r\nexhibitors of to-day. This is in part due to the fact that the cramming\r\non rich food and giving little exercise may result in rendering the show\r\npig in such a state of obesity as to secure the approval of the\r\nnon-practical judge, who is unable to appraise the points of a pig when\r\nin its natural breeding condition, but that to be able to follow the\r\npresent system of exhibiting at several successive shows and even when\r\nthe bloated pig is intended to be returned to the breeding pen, this\r\nexcessive feeding proved to be a grievous mistake. It may not be\r\npossible to claim that the over feeding of show animals is a thing of\r\nthe past, but there is little doubt that exhibitors of pigs have become\r\nalive to the fact that it is not profitable. Not only is the expense\r\nexcessive, but the damage done to the breeding animals is so great as to\r\nrender it inadvisable for any ordinary farmer to follow. Again, there\r\nhas of late years been a very considerable improvement in the pig\r\nclassification at both the breeding and the fat stock shows. When the\r\nwriter began pig showing, on his own account, fifty years since, the\r\ncommon classification at most of the shows was, boar any age, sows any\r\nage, and pens of three breeding pigs, not exceeding nine or in some\r\ncases even twelve months. There were no restrictions as to the age of\r\nthe boar or of the sow, no condition as to utility, of the sow having at\r\nany time reared a litter of pigs or of being in pig, so that it was by\r\nno means uncommon at even some of the chief shows to find both boars and\r\nsows appear year after year, having been guiltless of any attempt to\r\nprocreate their species, but having been kept solely for the purpose of\r\nwinning prizes and adding to the renown of their owners, if not directly\r\nadding much to their balances at the bank. The only way in which the\r\ncontinued exhibition of these old stagers was made profitable was the\r\nsecuring of customers for breeding stock from the exhibitors, who in far\r\ntoo many cases were not the breeders of the winning animals. To so great\r\nan extent had this purchase, frequently from middlemen or dealers of\r\nexhibition pigs, become in the seventies of the last century, that some\r\nof the live stock papers in the United States took up the cudgels on\r\nbehalf of the American breeders of pigs, who had been in the habit of\r\nimporting show winners from this country and plainly asked for the\r\nEnglish definition of a pure bred pig. It was pointed out at a recent\r\nshow of the Royal Agricultural Society several winners shown by one\r\nexhibitor were entered as of certain defined breeds, yet neither age,\r\npedigree, nor name of breeder was given, the only particulars given in\r\nthe show catalogue being the name and address of the exhibitor, the name\r\nof the pig, and the further statement age and breeder unknown. As our\r\nAmerican cousins asked, how could it be possible to ensure that a pig\r\nwas of a certain pure breed when it was admitted that no knowledge\r\nexisted of the breeding of the animal nor actually of the person who\r\nbred it. This scandal, as it was termed, was one of the contributing\r\ncauses of the establishment of societies for the registration of the\r\npedigrees of the various types or breeds of pigs.\r\n\r\nOther changes which have been great improvements have been the\r\nlimitation of the ages of boars and sows shown, the requirement that the\r\nsow has within a certain fixed time farrowed a litter of pigs and that\r\nwhen entered as being in farrow a certificate of subsequent farrowing\r\nshall be furnished ere the prize money is paid over. The age of the\r\nyoung boars and sows has also been reduced at most shows to six months,\r\nor the pigs must have been farrowed in the year of the show. In the good\r\nold times the age of the pigs shown in the classes for pens of two or\r\nthree or five, varied from six to twelve months, and the asserted age\r\ngiven by the exhibitor was accepted as correct. At many of the important\r\nshows not only are some means of identification asked for, but the state\r\nof the dentition are variously dealt with; at some shows they are\r\ndisqualified at once by the stewards on the certificate of the\r\nveterinary surgeon. It may at once be admitted that this mode of\r\nprocedure is very hard on an honest exhibitor whose pig has for some\r\nreason developed its temporary or permanent teeth abnormally--and such\r\ncases are not unknown--- although as a rule the various stages in the\r\ncutting of the permanent teeth are very regular, the majority of the\r\nirregularities are also in favour of the exhibitor, since delayed rather\r\nthan precocious development of dentition is the most common. Just how\r\nimperative it was that some steps should be taken to prevent mistakes\r\nbeing made in the ages of young pigs exhibited, many cases could be\r\ncited, but one may suffice where one of the sow pigs in a pen of five\r\nentered in a class for pigs not exceeding six months actually farrowed a\r\nlitter of fully developed pigs in the show yard.\r\n\r\nDuring the last forty years, great improvements have been made in the\r\nclassification for pigs at our principal Fat Stock shows. The division\r\nof breeds or types has been attended to and the ages of the pigs in the\r\nvarious classes have been greatly reduced. For instance, when the writer\r\nwas judging pigs with two colleagues at the 1880 show of the Smithfield\r\nClub, there were classes for Small White pigs, not exceeding nine\r\nmonths; above nine months, and not exceeding twelve months, and above\r\ntwelve months and not exceeding eighteen months. A more ridiculous\r\nclassification could not possibly have been devised since no small white\r\npig would have paid for fattening after it had become nine months old. A\r\nsimilar classification existed for pigs of the Large White breed, for\r\nBlack breeds, and for Berkshires. In addition there was a class for a\r\nsingle pig of any age or breed. The condition of some of the exhibits in\r\nthe oldest classes was most pitiable, they had been stuffed to such an\r\nextent that their life must have been a misery to them, they were unable\r\nto walk any distance, and to prevent suffocation rollers were used on\r\nwhich to raise their heads. The only way in which to describe these\r\nunfortunate subjects of man's inhumanity was as animated bladders of\r\nlard.\r\n\r\nAt the recent shows of the Smithfield Club, not only has the age limit\r\nbeen greatly reduced but classes for pigs not exceeding 100 lbs. live\r\nweight have been instituted, in addition to classes for all the\r\nrecognised pure breeds of pigs and those of any cross. Even this great\r\nreduction in age has not been enough to satisfy some of our reformers,\r\nas an endeavour is being made to reduce the limit of twelve months to\r\nnine months, so that in future the classes will be for pens of two pigs\r\nnot exceeding 100 lbs. live weight, for pigs not exceeding six months\r\nold and for pigs between six and nine months old, with certain classes\r\nfor single pigs under nine months. It is contended that fat pigs cannot\r\nbe profitably kept after they reach the age of nine months. Another\r\ninnovation of recent years at the Smithfield Show has been the\r\nestablishment of the so-called slaughter classes. This is probably by\r\nfar the greatest improvement of recent years in the pig section. Classes\r\nare provided for pigs not exceeding 100 lbs. live weight, pigs weighing\r\nover 100 lbs. and not exceeding 220 lbs., and for pigs above 220 lbs.\r\nand not exceeding 300 lbs. live weight. The pigs are first exhibited and\r\njudged alive, then slaughtered and the carcases judged on their pork\r\nmerits. There is also one class for pigs above 160 lbs. and not\r\nexceeding 240 lbs. live weight best suited for the manufacture of bacon.\r\nThese various classes have created great interest and have proved of the\r\ngreatest educational value.\r\n\r\nAnother beneficial effect of the changed conditions is the elimination\r\nfrom the summer show-yards of fat sows guiltless of milk and\r\naccompanied in the pen by half a score of young boars and yelts of an\r\nage varying from three months upwards, and which together were exhibited\r\nin the class for breeding sows, or breeding sows and pigs. A fine fat\r\nsow which would take kindly to an unlimited number of adopted youngsters\r\nwas in those days almost as valuable as a small gold mine. An old and\r\nwell-known pigman, Dick by name, assured the writer that no fewer than\r\nsixty-three young boars and yelts were sold in one year off or when in\r\ncompany of one well-known sow. At the present time the pigs shown with a\r\nsow must be certified to be her produce and not to exceed the age of\r\neight weeks.\r\n\r\nIt is at all times difficult to discover the motive power for certain\r\nactions on the part of a human being. It has been declared that there is\r\nan equal amount of doubt as to the cause of a breeder of stock wishing\r\nto exhibit his animals. Surely this last assertion is at least of a\r\ndoubtful character. What greater proof could a stock breeder give of his\r\npride in his animals than a burning desire to expose their good\r\nqualities to the public gaze. In addition to this, few men are entirely\r\nfree from the spirit of gambling and this enters into all competitions,\r\nparticularly in the show yards. The winning of prizes with stock may not\r\nbe quite so uncertain as the winning of horse races, still, there is\r\nenough of uncertainty to render the judging ring a centre of great\r\nexcitement. Some persons will even contend that the showing of farm\r\nstock is not desirable on the part of young farmers as it is likely to\r\nassume so great a similarity with gambling, that attending the shows\r\nmeans a neglect of business and leads to expensive habits. On the other\r\nhand, it cannot be denied that the exhibition of our improved specimens\r\nof stock has been of untold benefit to both home and foreign stock\r\nbreeders. Further, the exportation of our pedigree stock has actually\r\nsaved us from semi-starvation during this most fearful of all wars, as\r\nwithout our improved stock the native stock of foreign countries could\r\nnot possibly have furnished the enormous quantities of meat which we\r\nhave had to import.\r\n\r\nIt may be that a great many exhibitors of stock had little or no\r\nintention of becoming one when they first purchased their stock, but on\r\nthese proving quite the equal of that possessed by their neighbour, the\r\ndesire grew to suggest how good they were, or in many instances the\r\noriginal entries have been made in response to a request to support the\r\nlocal show.\r\n\r\nThis may be still another cause for a beginner in stock breeding\r\nexercising extreme care in the selection of his original stock. Even if\r\nthe prime cost be higher than that of ordinary market stock the extra\r\noutlay expended on animals from well-known breeders, and out of old\r\nestablished herds, is certain to prove a good investment. There is just\r\nas great difference in the different families or strains of our domestic\r\nstock, as there is in the various human families and of animals, and it\r\nmay be probably more true that the vast majority of the best of them are\r\nthe descendants of a comparatively few ancestors. This is evident in\r\nalmost everyone of the breeds of our improved stock, it is so in\r\nthoroughbred and shire horses, and so one might go through the whole\r\nlist of domesticated or farm animals.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore desirable that anyone who thinks of exhibiting his pigs\r\nshould endeavour first to discover the particular tribes or families\r\nwhich, in the past, have furnished a large proportion of the winners,\r\nand then to obtain some of the specimens of those families which have\r\nbeen successful in the show yards and in the breeding pen. This\r\ncombination is most important, as it does not necessarily follow that a\r\nline of blood which produces prize winners shall also produce animals\r\nwhich are not only good in type, character, and form, but possessed of\r\nprolificacy, free milking properties, and ability to raise large\r\nlitters. The difficulty of finding in some of the mere exhibition herds\r\nthis most desirable combination is due, in the main, to the far too\r\nfrequent neglect of the utility points, the two aims of the herdsman are\r\nin too many instances the winning of prizes for their employers and the\r\nsecuring of a percentage of the prize money for themselves.\r\n\r\nAlthough there have been attempts made to impress on outsiders the claim\r\nthat there exists in the training of pigs for successful exhibition in\r\nour show yards a large amount of mystery, yet, the practice is most\r\nsimple, it consists in the employment of the greatest possible\r\nobservation, care, and attention; without the continual use of these\r\nqualities it is not possible to become a really successful pigman. In\r\nvery many instances just that little extra attention has turned the\r\nscales. The one chief qualification on the part of a successful stock\r\nman is the art of taking pains. Unlike most of the other exhibitors of\r\npigs who exhibited largely over many years the writer never employed a\r\nprofessional pigman. The comparatively small number of pigmen who\r\nassisted him to win thousands of prizes were merely ordinary farm\r\nlabourers, save in one case, and he was an old sailor, yet one of the\r\nbest feeders and trainers we ever employed. He was naturally fond of\r\nanimals and was never tired of waiting on them and of supplying their\r\nneeds. It was once jokingly said of him that, having no children, he\r\nbestowed on the pigs in his care the love which some other people\r\nbestowed on their children. There is much of truth in the assertion made\r\nby a coloured preacher in the United States when discussing the want of\r\nsuccess of ordinary pig-keeping in the States, the chief cause he\r\ndeclared was the absence of love. We would call it want of natural\r\nfondness of animals and an insufficient determination to render the\r\nconditions of life of the animals in our charge as pleasant and\r\nsatisfactory as circumstances will allow. With regard to the system of\r\nrearing and feeding animals intended for exhibition, nothing more is\r\nneeded than the concentrated care and attention which is required in the\r\nsuccessful rearing and feeding of all commercial animals. A liberal\r\nsupply of suitable food, prepared in the most tempting form and\r\njudiciously fed to the pigs in just the quantity required, as frequently\r\nas the pig is able to thoroughly enjoy it. Little and often is a good\r\nmotto for the pig feeder. The more closely we adhere to nature, the\r\nmore successful shall we be. It is to this, perhaps, that exercise is so\r\nspecially necessary for pigs which are being prepared for the show yard.\r\nIt is impossible to render a pig perfectly fit for exhibition at a show,\r\nand more particularly at several successive shows, without plenty of\r\nexercise. Each morning and evening a walk of a distance varying with the\r\nages, etc., of the pigs is desirable. Another point to which some\r\nprofessional pigmen give great prominence is the regular dosing of their\r\ncharges with secret medicines. This is not only unnecessary, but may\r\nwith breeding animals prove harmful. A sound healthy pig seldom requires\r\nmedicine if it is properly fed and exercised. It is the over feeding or\r\nintense desire of the pigman which in the majority of cases renders\r\nmedicine necessary.\r\n\r\nA word of warning against this haste to get the pig into show condition.\r\nThis last can only be a work of time, and the commencement of the\r\nprocess must be in the early stages of the life of the pig and be\r\nsteadily continued until within a few days of the show. This slight\r\nreduction of the food may be necessary in the summer when the heat is\r\ngreat and the pigs become restless when travelling boxed up in a crate\r\nin an enclosed truck. Many of the pigs lost in travelling to or from the\r\nshows or soon after arriving at the shows, have been fed just prior to\r\nbeing loaded up, because of the difficulty in feeding them when on the\r\njourney. This is an entire mistake; not only should the pigs not be fed,\r\nbut prior to being put into the crates they should be given just so much\r\nexercise as will cause them to evacuate the bowels, or the bladder. Care\r\nin this respect and non-exposure to the rays of the sun may not in\r\nevery case prevent trouble, but it will most certainly reduce to a\r\nminimum the chance of it. Should a pig suffer from the heat, cold water\r\nshould be applied to the head by means of a sponge or a cloth, and\r\nshould some of the water percolate into the mouth of the pig so much the\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nPRESENT AND FUTURE PIG-KEEPING\r\n\r\n\r\nAs it is impossible to foretell the effect which the present disastrous\r\nwar will have upon the pig-breeding industry, we have deemed it\r\nexpedient to refer as briefly as possible to the present conditions of\r\nfeeding, etc., which may or may not prove to be of a temporary character\r\nor which may become permanent in a more or less modified manner.\r\n\r\nOne of the results of the scarcity and high market value of the\r\ndifferent articles which have been commonly used in the feeding of pigs\r\nis drawing greatly increased attention to the original conditions under\r\nwhich pigs were kept, i.e. when they were in a wild state or when they\r\nwere allowed their partial freedom for the purpose of getting their own\r\nliving to a greater or lesser extent.\r\n\r\nWe are aware that a claim has been made by an enthusiastic convert to\r\npig-keeping that in allowing his pigs their liberty to roam over grass\r\nfields and in woods he is practising quite a novel course of procedure,\r\nbut the old hands merely smile and admire the enthusiasm which is more\r\nnearly allied with youth than old age. The practice may not have been\r\ngenerally followed of late years, but in the middle of the last century\r\nit was to the writer's knowledge common in certain of the Eastern\r\nCounties, particularly in Suffolk and portions of Essex and\r\nCambridgeshire, where a considerable acreage of grass and especially\r\nclovers was grazed by pigs, having a greater or lesser quantity of other\r\nfood as the pigs were intended for breeding or fattening purposes.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, some shelter of a temporary character was provided\r\nfailing that furnished by trees, and straw stacks, etc., but our\r\nAmerican cousins have gone one better in that they have introduced small\r\nmovable houses which can be transported on wheels and can be utilised\r\nfor a sow and her pigs, or for a number of stores. In the former course,\r\nan enclosure sufficiently large for the sow to graze therein is fenced\r\nin so that each sow can be kept separate until the pigs are old enough\r\nto prevent others from robbing them of their birthright. The chief\r\ndifficulty attending this system is not experienced in the United States\r\nto the extent it is in this country, since the general custom there is\r\nto allow each sow to farrow a litter of pigs in the spring and then to\r\nfatten off both sow and pigs, save those reserved for breeding purposes\r\nnext year. This plan, which appears to be wasteful, also handicaps the\r\nowner who desires to improve his pig stock, since an opportunity is\r\ndenied him of discovering the best of his sows and so reserving them and\r\ntheir produce to form the nucleus of a really good herd. The system is\r\nnot an entirely new one, as it is practised to a great extent in some\r\nparts of Lincolnshire and other Northern counties, where there is not\r\nthe excuse made for it in the States that it avoids the trouble and\r\nrisk from the intense cold attending the farrowing of sows in the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nIt may be that the severity of our winters is not usually great, but the\r\ncold, damp and foggy weather commonly experienced in England during the\r\nlast two or three months of the year render it necessary to warmly house\r\nyoung pigs, and this is difficult in wooden houses of limited size, as\r\nthese become hot and stuffy when entirely closed, or damp and cold when\r\nunclosed. Again, the labour attending the feeding of a large herd housed\r\nin isolated sties must be very considerable. Another objection raised\r\nagainst this farrowing of sows in these small houses is that it is\r\ndifficult if not impossible at night to have the pigman in attendance on\r\nthe sow, further, that it is not advisable to allow the young pigs to\r\nroam about with their dam until they are some weeks old, as when the\r\nweather is cold or wet they become chilled and when the sun is hot they\r\nquickly become blistered, both conditions materially interfering with\r\ntheir well doing.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed that both sow and pigs are able to secure a large portion\r\nof their living, but a sow with a good litter of pigs on her requires a\r\nconsiderable amount of food in addition to grass to enable her to do\r\njustice to her young, whilst the younger pigs are unable to digest any\r\nquantity of grass until they are some weeks old; besides this, the\r\nyoungsters thrive much better during their early life when confined in\r\nquarters than when trailing about after the sow. Could we ensure fairly\r\nfine weather, and an absence of cold nights and very changeable\r\nweather, the little pigs' chances of thriving under outdoor conditions\r\nwould be considerably enhanced.\r\n\r\nAnother alleged new discovery is the permitting of pigs to roam at large\r\nin woods and plantations, wooden huts or open sheds being provided as\r\nshelter. By this plan a considerable amount of pig food is obtained\r\nwhere the trees are not closely planted, so that grass grows freely, or,\r\nin the autumn, in the woods in which oaks, beech, hazel, or sweet\r\nchestnut form a portion of the trees. In such woods strong store pigs\r\nare able to obtain the major portion of their food, but where the trees\r\nare of a kind which does not produce nuts or are closely planted, the\r\nadditional food must be more plentiful, whilst the manurial value of the\r\nfood is wasted to a considerable extent.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most profitable form of outdoor pig-keeping is that of\r\nrunning the pigs in orchards. This system has many advantages, the pigs\r\nare able to live without much additional food for some months in the\r\nyear, they consume the insect-affected fallen fruit, and so act as\r\ninsecticides. The pigs also usually leave their droppings under the\r\ntrees, which are thus benefited therefrom, and especially is this the\r\ncase where the pigs are being fattened or fed on food which enables them\r\nto make flesh. Many years since, the writer had several customers for\r\nbreeding pigs who kept numbers of pigs in their orchards. One fruit\r\ngrower in Kent declared that fattening pigs in his orchard resulted in\r\nthe growing of heavier crops of cherries of larger size, better colour,\r\nand finer flavour. Another whose apple orchard was disappointing\r\nfollowed my advice to fatten pigs in it, declared that the quantity of\r\napples grown was much greater, whilst both the size and quality of these\r\nwere infinitely better.\r\n\r\nUnder the modern system of pig-keeping it is more profitable to give\r\nsome additional and concentrated food to the pigs having their liberty,\r\nit is therefore wise to secure the full benefit arising from the richer\r\nliving by running the pigs where the manure can be utilised, and no\r\nbetter place than an orchard can be found, since shelter from sun and\r\nwind is furnished by the fruit trees, and the pigs deposit their urine\r\nand excrement in exactly the place where it is most urgently required.\r\n\r\nThe practice of growing considerable areas of rape or cole seed,\r\nartichokes, peas of various kinds, beans, etc., to be fed off by pigs is\r\nnot followed extensively in this country, although pig-keepers in the\r\nUnited States, Canada, Germany, Denmark, etc., have a partiality to it,\r\nsince it is declared to save labour and to bring the land into a good\r\nmanurial condition for the growth of corn crops; still some few of our\r\nmore advanced farmers have been in the habit of grazing off lucerne,\r\nclovers, and even permanent and temporary grasses by the aid of pigs,\r\nwhich have also received in addition a varying amount of roots, corn, or\r\nmeal. It is asserted, and evidence is available to prove the truth of\r\nthe statement, that land can be economically and quickly and vastly\r\nimproved by following the system referred to above. The scarcity and\r\nhigh market value of miller's offals and of meals such as used in the\r\npast to be utilised to a great extent in the feeding of pigs, has\r\ncaused pig-keepers to seek for other foods to take their place. The\r\nresiduum from the crushing of palm nuts, cocoa-nuts, and ground nuts has\r\nbeen most successfully used in connection with various forms of\r\nvegetable food; even sows have reared good litters of pigs on about 2\r\nlbs. of a mixture of the meals remaining from the extraction of the oil\r\nfrom the nuts mentioned, with the addition of some form of vegetable\r\nfood. This last has comprised cooked potatoes, raw artichokes, mangolds,\r\nkohl rabi, swedes, cabbages, etc., during the winter months, and grass,\r\nlucerne, clover, vetches, cole seed, etc., during the summer months.\r\nFattening pigs will require a somewhat larger quantity of concentrated\r\nfood and a reduced amount of vegetable food. The pre-war belief that\r\nsharps or middlings only was the most suitable food for sows with\r\nlitters and for newly weaned pigs has been somewhat modified. Whether or\r\nnot the quality and price of middlings will be restored after the war\r\nand thus its use become general as of old, must be left, but it is\r\nprobable that in the future a certain proportion of the meals referred\r\nto will continue to be used for both breeding and fattening pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nPIG-FATTENING\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there be one task which is considered to be within the capacity of\r\nany individual, it is that of feeding a pig. In the good old times, the\r\none thing needful was a good supply of barley meal, as much of this as\r\nthe pig could possibly eat was placed into its trough each day until the\r\npig was thought to be fat enough for slaughter. This was a very simple\r\nand at the same time a very costly process and was looked upon as the\r\nsecond of the two chief acts in the life of a pig. The first consisted\r\nof building up a frame on which fat could be stored. Just why these two\r\nprocesses were not combined has never been fully explained. One excuse\r\nmade for this uneconomical process is that our forbears must have\r\nconsidered that there must be two distinct periods in the life of any\r\nanimal intended for the food of man, that in which the structure was\r\nerected, and that in which the building was completely furnished with\r\nthe material--flesh--in a state which most nearly satisfied the\r\nrequirements or fancies of humanity. The system of first growing the\r\nframe and then packing it with flesh was not alone followed by the\r\nowners of pigs, as it was also adopted with cattle, which in the good\r\nold times passed three or four years in a state of semi-starvation ere\r\nthey were placed on our best pastures to produce beef. Sheep, again,\r\nspent two or three years in building up their frames and in the\r\nproduction of a limited quantity of wool of inferior quality and\r\nstrength, before they were considered in a fit state to make mutton\r\neconomically. Another excuse which could have been offered by our\r\nforbears, but which is not now available, is that the cattle, sheep, and\r\npigs of former times required age before it was possible to render them\r\nsufficiently fat for slaughter.\r\n\r\nThe very great improvement which has taken place during the past half\r\ncentury, in wellnigh every breed of pig, has deprived our present day\r\npig-breeders of such an excuse, yet they persist in far too many\r\ninstances in following the old-fashioned and uneconomical system of\r\nfirst growing the pig and then fatting it, whereas it is not only\r\npossible but infinitely more profitable to combine the two operations.\r\nSo many persons have been in the habit of looking upon the pig as a mere\r\nscavenger or an animal to put out of sight certain articles containing a\r\nsmall amount of nutriment which, undisposed of, would become a nuisance\r\nor offensive to one or other of our organs. Even the pig itself has been\r\nconsidered by many farmers, especially those termed gentlemen farmers,\r\nas a necessary nuisance, whereas the pig is really a machine for the\r\nconversion of farm produce into meat, and like all machines, its output\r\nwill depend entirely on the quantity and quality of the raw material,\r\nand the manner in which it is supplied. If the raw material be of\r\ninferior quality and supplied irregularly, or in too limited\r\nquantities, the article manufactured will be more costly and of an\r\ninferior quality. An extension in the time of manufacture means\r\nincreased cost for fuel and for labour in attendance on the machinery. A\r\ncertain quantity of fuel is being continually used in the furnace\r\nwhether the engine is running at full power or at half power. It is\r\nexactly the same with the meat making machine, the pig every day of its\r\nexistence consumes a certain quantity of food for which it gives one\r\nreturn only, its life. It has been conclusively proved that each pig\r\nweighing 100 lbs. requires 2 lbs. of food daily to enable it to sustain\r\nlife, i.e. to replace loss of tissue, to provide heat, progression,\r\netc., so that if a pig lives six months longer than is actually\r\nnecessary to enable it to manufacture a certain weight of meat, it will\r\nhave eaten to waste over 3 cwt. of good food.\r\n\r\nA pig is like unto any other machine, it will produce the manufactured\r\narticle most cheaply when it is fully supplied with the most suitable\r\nraw material. There is not the slightest doubt that the least costly\r\npork is that which is produced by the pig which spends its whole time in\r\nthe object of its existence, the manufacture of pork.\r\n\r\nThere is a further point of great importance. Wellnigh all those\r\nmaterials which are used in the feeding of pigs contain the constituents\r\nnecessary for the building up of the frame and for the accumulation of\r\nfat or, as it is commonly termed, the making of meat. Evidently nature\r\nintended that the two operations should be carried on simultaneously.\r\nThose constituents which are required in the building up of the frame\r\ncannot be entirely used in the formation of fat, consequently if the\r\nframe is first built up and then an attempt is made to lay on flesh, a\r\nconsiderable portion of the building up constituents are simply wasted,\r\nsince the pig has no need for them and cannot make complete use of them.\r\nThey simply pass through the pig after taxing it to digest them, and are\r\nwasted.\r\n\r\nOpinions and practices with regard to pig fatting have changed very much\r\nduring the past half century, and especially so since the full effect of\r\nthe fearful war has been felt. Rather before the first-mentioned period,\r\nthe late Sir John Lawes, whose researches and experiments have been of\r\nlasting benefit to agriculturists, undertook to carry out experiments in\r\nconnection with pig-breeding, and the result which appears to have\r\nimpressed itself most upon the writers of the day was that barley meal\r\nwas the best single food for the fatting of pigs. At the time named, our\r\nimportations of maize and of many other materials now used in stock and\r\nespecially pig-breeding were not of anything the magnitude of the period\r\nprior to the war, still, it seems to be strange to the enlightened\r\npig-breeder of to-day that more serious endeavours should not have been\r\nmade to determine the value of a mixed diet for pigs, since this had\r\nbeen proved to be beneficial and necessary in the case of human beings\r\nwhose organs are so very similar to that of the despised pig.\r\n\r\nFortunately for us, and indeed for the stock-keepers in all parts of the\r\nworld, experiments in the feeding of stock have been carried out in\r\nvarious countries, Denmark, Sweden, the United States, Canada,\r\nGermany, and indeed in nearly all countries, save to any great extent in\r\nEngland. In connection with pigs, the practices of a few of our more\r\nintelligent pig-keepers have been confirmed. Amongst these ideas which\r\nthe old-fashioned ones looked upon as fads, was that of feeding pigs of\r\nall ages and especially fatting pigs on a certain proportion of\r\nvegetable food. Experiments have conclusively proved that the\r\nsubstitution of some 10 per cent of vegetable matter in place of an\r\nequal amount of meal or concentrated food, does not result in the\r\nslightest reduction in the live weight gain of the fatting pig, and\r\nfurther that the old idea that a limited quantity of vegetable food fed\r\nto a fatting pig tended to render the pork soft and to waste in the\r\ncooking was not founded on fact. Another fact which has evolved from\r\nthese experiments is that the pig will make far greater progress on an\r\nequal amount of a mixture of foods than if fed solely on one food. This\r\nwas clearly proved in many experiments as at the Wisconsin Agricultural\r\nStation, where one lot of pigs was fed on middlings alone, a second lot\r\non corn meal alone, and a third lot on a mixture of corn meal and\r\nmiddlings. To make an increase of 100 lbs. in their live weight, the\r\npigs in Lot 1 ate 522 lbs. of middlings, those in Lot 2 ate 537 lbs. of\r\ncorn meal to make an equal increase in weight, whilst Lot 3, which were\r\nfed on a mixture of corn meal and middlings, required only 439 lbs., or\r\na saving of one-fifth in the weight of food. In experiments with regard\r\nto the food value of corn meal and middlings carried out at the\r\nMissouri College, middlings also gave the best returns, but\r\nunfortunately the ages of the pigs used in the trials are omitted. This\r\nis important as middlings are considered to be of more value in the\r\nfeeding of young than of older pigs, whilst the reverse holds good of\r\ncorn or maize meal. Other trials were carried out at Wisconsin with the\r\nuse of wheat meal alone as compared with a mixture of half wheat and\r\nhalf corn meal. In these the average quantity of wheat meal required for\r\n100 lbs. increased live weight was 500 lbs., whilst only 485 lbs. of the\r\nmixture of wheat and corn meals was needed to obtain an equal increase\r\nor a saving of some 5 per cent was obtained by mixing the meals.\r\n\r\nIn the good old times it was considered to be the height of folly to\r\nmake a change in the food on which the pigs were being fattened, yet our\r\nforbears would have been horrified had they been informed that it was\r\nimperative that they themselves should have no variety of food, that day\r\nafter day the food at their various meals should be exactly similar;\r\nsurely what is good for one animal should be good for another animal\r\nwhose organs are of an exactly similar character. There is not the\r\nslightest doubt that advantage is derived from the variation in the food\r\non which the pigs are being fattened. By this, it is not intended to\r\nsuggest that a complete change of food should be made at stated times in\r\nthe fatting pigs' food, as this would certainly result in a loss of time\r\nand food, but that a slight variation in the proportions of the\r\ndifferent kinds of food is beneficial, or in the case where several\r\ndifferent kinds of food are being fed as a mixture, another kind of\r\nfood may be substituted so that the change made secures a variation\r\nwhich has the effect of whetting or enticing the appetite. A long\r\ncontinuance of the same kind of food has the effect of dulling the\r\nappetite. In addition to this, it is considered that a variation in the\r\nfood tends to stimulate the digestive organs.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to allow too long a time to pass between feeding times;\r\nthe pig is not endowed by nature with a capacious paunch which enables\r\nit to stow away a large quantity of food. Even the old system of feeding\r\ntwice a day might be improved upon, and the fatting pig fed three times\r\nper day would make greater thrift, even should the actual daily quantity\r\nof food be not increased.\r\n\r\nAgain, so many persons are apt to give to the fatting pig a greater\r\nquantity of food than it requires or can eat with comfort to itself at\r\none meal. Should this be pointed out to them, their usual reply would be\r\nthat what the pig did not eat for their breakfast would be there in\r\nreadiness for the evening meal unless they ate it during the day, as\r\nthey frequently would do. This sounds plausible until the argument be\r\nclosely examined. What would the pigman think if he were treated in a\r\nsimilar manner and an excessive quantity of food placed on his plate,\r\nand then at the next meals the stale food be again placed before him\r\nuntil it was finished? This certainly would not increase his appetite\r\nnor aid his digestion. Yet the most successful pigman is he who succeeds\r\nin so feeding his charges that they daily eat and thoroughly digest the\r\ngreatest amount of food possible. In pig fattening, as in many other\r\nthings, time is money. Further it is just as much a mistake for fatting\r\npigs as for human beings to be continually eating, or at irregular\r\nintervals, small quantities of food. The two most certain indications\r\nthat a lot of fatting pigs are thriving is to find that they are asleep\r\nand that their feeding troughs are empty. When pigs are fed a greater\r\nquantity of food than they can eat at once they will be frequently\r\ngetting up to eat a little more of the surplus, and each time they rise\r\nfrom their bed they will evacuate their bowels, and in most cases before\r\nthe major portion of the nutriment has been extracted.\r\n\r\nStill another of the fallacies of our forbears was that the fatting pig\r\nmade the greatest increase from a given quantity of food when it was at\r\nleast approaching maturity and ripeness, or complete fatness. It was\r\nuseless to argue with them, since anyone could see that it was so. If\r\nyou suggested the use of the scales, the idea was scouted, since a\r\nperson of any experience in pig fatting must be able to notice the\r\nincrease in bulk of the pig. It is true that apparently the pig would be\r\nmaking a greater increase of weight as it approached the completion of\r\nits fatting process, since the addition to its weight and bulk would be\r\nalmost entirely composed of fat which could only be deposited on the\r\noutside of the carcase. All the vacant space in the interior of the pig\r\nwould have been occupied, the pig would have stored fat away in its\r\nmuscles, around its kidneys, on its stomach, its bowels, and wherever it\r\nwas possible to stow it away, but these additions to the weight of the\r\ncarcase which had been proceeding in the early stages of the fatting\r\ncould not be observed, nevertheless they were proceeding, and in this\r\nwas the pig enabled in its early stage of fatting to make a profitable\r\nreturn for the food consumed.\r\n\r\nFortunately we are not left on this point to mere conjecture; many\r\nexperiments have clearly proved that in the early stages of the life of\r\na pig it is enabled to manufacture pork at a far less cost than in its\r\nlater stages of life. The young pig also possesses over its older\r\ncompanion the great advantage of being able to eat and utilise a greater\r\nquantity of food in proportion to its weight or, in other words, the\r\nyoung pig can convert a greater quantity of raw material into the\r\nmanufactured article than the more matured pig, in proportion to the\r\namount of food required for the mere upkeep of the machinery.\r\nExperiments which most clearly prove this have been duplicated in\r\nDenmark, in the United States, etc. At Copenhagen nearly seventy\r\ndifferent experiments were carried out with pigs of varying weights,\r\nwith the result that pigs weighing about 275 lbs. live weight were found\r\nto require nearly twice as much food to make an increase in their live\r\nweight as did pigs weighing from 35 to 75 lbs. That this was not an\r\nexceptional case is clearly proved by the fact that the increase in the\r\namount of food required to enable them to make an increase in their live\r\nweight was gradual, and shown in every stage; thus pigs of from 35 to 75\r\nlbs. consumed 376 lbs. of food for each 100 lbs. increase; pigs of 75 to\r\n115 lbs., 435 lbs.; pigs of 115 to 155 lbs., 466 lbs.; pigs of 155 lbs.\r\nto 195 lbs., 513 lbs.; pigs of 195 lbs. to 235 lbs., 540 lbs.; pigs of\r\n235 lbs. to 275 lbs., 614 lbs.; and pigs of 275 lbs. to 315 lbs., 639\r\nlbs.\r\n\r\nEven if this series of experiments stood alone they surely would prove\r\nmost conclusively that the common belief in old and nearly fat pigs\r\ngiving the best return from the food consumed is founded on fiction, but\r\nsimilar tests were made at many of the American Experiment Stations,\r\nthese tests together numbering some hundred. The results are given in\r\ntabulated form in Henry's _Feeds and Feeding_, where the various points\r\nare so clearly brought out that we have taken the liberty of lifting the\r\nwhole of the notes relating to \"weight, gain, and feed consumed\" by\r\npigs. \"At many of our stations, records of weights and gains of pigs and\r\nfeed consumed by them have been so reported as to permit of studies\r\nconcerning the influence of increased size and weight of the animal on\r\nthe consumption of food.\r\n\r\n\"All of the available data from trials of this character conducted in\r\nthis country\" (the United States) \"up to the time of going to press,\r\nenter into the composition of the table given below.

After this point\r\nis reached the number of animals is too small to give reliable averages.\r\nThe heavy weight hogs reported in the last three lines of the table were\r\nfed by the writer (Professor Henry). They were mature specimens, with\r\nlarge frames and in lean flesh when feeding began, having been summered\r\non pasture without grain. The figures are introduced to show what may be\r\naccomplished with mature hogs when they are in thin flesh at the\r\nbeginning of fattening.\r\n\r\n\"We learn from the main portion of the table that from 105 to 435 pigs\r\nwere employed in calculating each line of data. The number of trials\r\nfurnishing the data varied from 19 to 119, and were conducted by from 3\r\nto 13 experiment stations.\r\n\r\n\"Amount of food consumed daily by the pig. The sixth column of the table\r\nshows the average amount of feed consumed daily by pigs of different\r\nweights. From it we learn that pigs weighing less than 50 lbs. each,\r\naveraging 38 lbs., consumed on the average 2.23 lbs. of grain or grain\r\nequivalent, daily. As the animal increased in weight there was a gradual\r\nincrease in the amount of food consumed, until we find the 450 lbs. hog\r\neating 10 lbs. of grain daily, or more than four times as much as the 50\r\nlbs. pig.\r\n\r\n\"Feed per 100 lbs. live weight: In the seventh column it is shown that\r\npigs weighing 38 lbs. consumed 5.95 lbs. of feed for each 100 lbs. of\r\nlive weight. This is about 6 per cent of their live weight. As the pigs\r\ngrew larger they consumed less feed for 100 lbs. of live weight, until\r\nwith the heaviest hogs the feed consumed was little more than 2 per cent\r\nof their live weight. Here was a decrease of about two-thirds in the\r\nfeed consumption per 100 lbs. between early weight and maturity.\r\n\r\n\"Average daily gain: In the next column are presented data concerning\r\nthe daily gain of the pig. It is shown that the 38 lb. pig gained .76 of\r\na lb., or 2 per cent of its own weight daily. As it increased in size\r\nthe pig made larger daily gains, the maximum being reached with those\r\nweighing 271 lbs., which made a daily gain of 1.46 lb. With large thin\r\nhogs the gain reached 1.98 lb., or practically 2 lbs. per day, but these\r\nanimals, because of their mature frames and thin flesh, were fed under\r\nexceptional circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"Feed for 100 lbs. of gain: The last column is of interest to all,\r\nespecially the practical feeder, for it teaches a most interesting and\r\nimportant lesson concerning the feed requirements of pigs. Those which\r\naverage 38 lbs. each made 100 lbs. of gain from 293 lbs. of feed. This\r\nexceedingly small allowance of feed for gain was probably due in part to\r\nthe fact that the young pigs used in these trials received much milk,\r\nwhich was practically all digestible, the other feed being also more\r\nhighly digestible than that usually supplied older animals. With pigs\r\nweighing 78 lbs., 400 lbs. of feed were required for 100 lbs. of gain.\r\nThere was a gradual increase of feed requirements for 100 lbs. of gain,\r\nuntil the hog weighing 320 lbs. required 525 lbs. for each 100 lbs. of\r\ngain. This is 135 lbs. or 33 per cent more feed than was required by the\r\n78 lbs. pig.\"\r\n\r\nThese tables prove most conclusively that the idea which is almost\r\nuniversally prevalent that the fatting pig gives the greatest increase\r\nfor the food which it consumes when it becomes matured and nearly fat is\r\nan entirely mistaken one, and that the young and growing pig, if well\r\nkept, not only eats more in proportion to its weight, but gives a better\r\nreturn for the food it consumes, besides requiring a smaller amount of\r\nfood to keep life within itself, and to replace the certain loss\r\nsustained by movement, etc. There is still another point on which the\r\nyoung pig scores: its carcase realises a higher price per lb. on a\r\nmajority of the markets. The fatting pig which pays best is one which\r\nhas a short life and a merry one, never having to seek or wait for its\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nAmongst the many other questions which have been compelled attention\r\nowing to the shortage and the high value of pig food, is that of the\r\nadvisability or the reverse of cooking the food given to pigs. When the\r\npractice of showing stock became fashionable every possible means of\r\nforcing the exhibits was practised, since early maturity was of so great\r\nimportance, especially in the classes for the younger animals. The\r\ncooking of the stronger kinds of food such as old beans for horses had\r\nbeen found beneficial, as the risk of fever in the feet and other\r\nailments had been greatly reduced by this practice. The stock man\r\nnaturally concluded that the cooking or steaming of beans having proved\r\nto be of advantage, similar good results would follow the steaming of\r\nthe other kinds of food. In this fanciful theory they would have been\r\nable to find ample support in many of the books on stock feeding which\r\nwere published in the first half of the last century and even later.\r\nLike many other novelties, the steaming or boiling of almost all kinds\r\nof food for animals was followed in the establishments of well-to-do\r\npersons where cost was studied less than success in the show yards.\r\nThen, as now, the Germans took little for granted, they proceeded to\r\ntest the much belauded new plan by attempting to discover the fact as to\r\nwhether steaming rendered hay more digestible when fed to cattle, with\r\nthe result that it was clearly proved that when the hay was fed dry 46\r\nper cent of the protein was digested by the cattle while only 30 per\r\ncent was digested from the steamed hay. But as our present business is\r\nwith pig-feeding, we will confine our remarks to the results of\r\nexperiments carried out to test the effects of cooking the food of pigs.\r\nPerhaps the best summary of these is to be found in the most valuable\r\nwork, _Feeds and Feeding_, by Professor Henry, who wrote _Experiments\r\nwith Cooked Feed for Pigs_.\r\n\r\nThese have been so numerous that all cannot be here presented. Those\r\ngiven are selected because they are strictly representative, covering a\r\nwide range of country foods and conditions.\r\n\r\n\"At the Kansas Agricultural College, Shelton fed one lot of five pigs on\r\ncooked shelled corn, while a second lot of four, similar in all\r\nrespects, was given uncooked shelled corn, the trial lasting ninety\r\ndays. In cooking, the corn was placed in a barrel and water poured over\r\nit; into this mass a pipe carried steam, at a pressure ranging from 30\r\nto 60 lbs. The kernels were cooked until they were sufficiently soft\r\nto be easily mashed between the thumb and finger.\r\n\r\n\"At the Iowa Agricultural College, Stalker conducted trials for 120 days\r\nin summer with cooked and uncooked shelled corn fed to Berkshire pigs.\r\n\r\n\"At the Dominion (Canada) Station, Robertson fed grade Chester Whites, a\r\nmixture of ground peas, barley, and rye, the trials beginning in\r\nDecember and lasting 141 days.\r\n\r\n\"At the Ohio Station, Devol fed pure bred Poland Chinas and Berkshires\r\nfor 112 days in winter. One lot of three pigs received the meal cooked,\r\nwhile to the second lot it was given dry and uncooked.\r\n\r\n\"At the Wisconsin Station, the writer (Henry) has conducted many trials\r\nwith cooked and uncooked feed for pigs. Only the later ones are here\r\nreported. These trials lasted from 56 to 84 days each, the kinds of feed\r\nexperimented being given in the table.\r\n\r\n\"The five trials reported from the Wisconsin Station, as will be seen by\r\nconsulting the table, are slightly in favour of cooked food, the\r\ndifference being very small, however. These are the only feeding trials\r\nreported from any experiment station, so far as known to the writer,\r\nwhere the results are favourable to cooking. Ten other trials by the\r\nwriter with cooked and uncooked feed for swine all gave results\r\nunfavourable to cooking these, and a number of trials at other stations\r\nwith cooked and uncooked feed for swine are not included for want of\r\nspace.\"\r\n\r\nA table showing the stations at which the various experiments were\r\ncarried out, the numbers and weights of the pigs, the varieties of\r\nfoods, the duration of the different trials, the daily gain, the weights\r\nof cooked and uncooked food consumed, the manner of cooking, the total\r\nincreases in weight and the quantities of cooked and uncooked food\r\nrequired for increases of 100 lbs. in the live weights of the pigs are\r\ngiven. Professor Henry sums these up and writes: \"Including all the\r\ntrials then, so far as is known, that have been favourable to cooking\r\nfeed and omitting many for lack of space, that are unfavourable to that\r\noperation, the average shows that 476 lbs. of uncooked meal or grain\r\nwere required for 100 lbs. of gain with pigs, while after it was cooked\r\n505 lbs. were required. This shows a loss of 6 per cent of the feeding\r\nvalue of these substances through cooking.\"\r\n\r\nSome thirty-five years since the present writer made some small\r\nexperiments in the feeding of cooked and uncooked whole maize; in each\r\ncase it was found that the pigs ate a greater quantity of uncooked than\r\ncooked maize, and made a greater proportionate increase in weight from\r\nthe food consumed. Only one opinion appears to be possible, and this is\r\nthat the cooking of food for pigs, save potatoes, entails a loss of\r\ntime, an increase in cost, and a reduced return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nA PIG CALENDAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pig-keeper, like the gardener, seldom has to seek for employment,\r\nindeed his work may be said to be only occasionally completed. There are\r\nalways many little odd jobs to do, which if neglected may result in\r\nloss, or a greatly increased amount of work at some later period. The\r\nold proverb \"A stitch in time saves nine\" is equally as true in\r\nconnection with pig keeping as with any other form of work.\r\n\r\nIn years gone by the month of January was considered to be quite a slack\r\ntime for pig-keepers, the sows and the store pigs usually found the\r\ngreater part of their living in the yards where the cattle were fed on\r\nthe straw which was continually being placed in the cribs as the\r\nold-man-of-the-farm threshed the corn out of it with his flail. Many of\r\nthe cribs had slatted bottoms so that any kernels of corn which were\r\nleft in the straw would drop through and be picked up by the pigs which\r\nfound their way under the cribs. In most of the old-fashioned large\r\nyards a corner would be railed off in which the pigs would be given a\r\nfew turnips, swedes, or small potatoes, and occasionally a handful or\r\ntwo of beans or even a sheaf of beans. Those fatting pigs which had not\r\nalready been converted into bacon for consumption in the farm-house were\r\nfed mainly on meal ground at the local wind or water mill from the tail\r\ncorn grown by the farmer. At the present time the most up-to-date\r\npig-keepers so arrange that many of the older sows farrow during this\r\nmonth of January so that the sows have their second litter of the year\r\nlate in the month of June or early in July in order that both litters of\r\npigs obtain the greatest amount of benefit from the growing and hot\r\nseason, since pigs thrive best when the days are lengthening and when\r\nthe sun shines.\r\n\r\nOf late years we appear to have had somewhat severe weather in January.\r\nThis has rendered it the more necessary that care should be taken in\r\nproviding water and wind-tight sties, in which the sows farrow. Warmth\r\nwith free ventilation is needed. The latter is particularly necessary\r\nafter the pigs are a few days old, as these do not suffer so much from\r\ncold as they do from damp and draughts. Of course whilst the sow is\r\nfarrowing warmth is imperative, as the moist little pigs when first\r\nejected very quickly become chilled in severe frost, unless they are\r\npromptly wiped with a dry cloth, allowed a draught or two of new milk\r\nfrom the sow, and then placed in a box or hamper three parts filled with\r\ndry wheat straw. When once the pigs become thoroughly dry the cold does\r\nnot affect them very much, providing that the sow furnishes her family\r\nwith a full supply of milk. The cost of heating a little water so that\r\nthe sow and also the young pigs as soon as they begin to eat may have\r\nwarmed food, will be slight, as there is nearly always a fire required\r\nin cottage and farm-house during the cold weather. Warm food makes a\r\nvast difference in the thrift of pigs, especially of young ones. Very\r\nslight observation will reveal the marked difference in the comfort of a\r\npig which has had a meal of warm or of cold food. In the former case the\r\npig will return to its nest and is soon lost in sleep, whilst the poor\r\nbeggar which has had its breakfast on cold and occasionally frozen food\r\nwill be the picture of misery and shaking with cold, much of its natural\r\nheat produced from its last meal being required to warm up the food ere\r\nits digestive organs can commence work. Coal and wood are at all times\r\nless expensive to warm up food than the animal fat which is burned in\r\nnature's lamp.\r\n\r\nProvision should have been made for the supply of some kind of vegetable\r\nfood which pigs require, particularly when in confinement. Kohl rabi,\r\nswedes and cabbages, of which the first named is the best, are all\r\nsuitable, but the most nourishing are artichokes, which like the three\r\nformer should be fed raw, and potatoes which should be cooked ere they\r\nare fed to the pigs. The difference in the feeding value between cooked\r\nand uncooked potatoes is great. It is scarcely necessary to point out\r\nthat all vegetable food fed to pigs should have been protected from\r\nfrost.\r\n\r\nThe operations connected with pig-keeping are very similar in February\r\nto those of the preceding month. Towards the end of the month kohl rabis\r\nwill have lost much of their feeding value. On sunny days a run out for\r\na few minutes will be of great benefit to the young pigs over a month\r\nold; as soon as they cease to gallop about they should be shut up again,\r\nas if allowed to lie down they may contract a chill which might result\r\nin \"cramp\" or rheumatism. Sows with litters two or three weeks old\r\nshould be allowed out of the sty each morning and afternoon for a short\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe month of March brings with it an extra amount of work for the\r\npig-keeper, who will now think of selling the pigs born early in January\r\nunless he purposes to keep them on and have them ready for sale as fat\r\npigs in harvest time, when there is always a good demand for medium\r\nsized fat pigs. Anyway the sow pigs intended for breeding will have been\r\npicked out and earmarked, this last should not be neglected after the\r\nothers have been spayed.\r\n\r\nThis last operation has of late years been much neglected; this is a\r\ngreat mistake, as experiments have clearly proved that on an average sow\r\npigs which have been spayed will make an equal gain in live weight on 5\r\nper cent less food than will an unspayed sow pig, when both have become\r\nsome five or six months old, and the periods of [oe]strum have\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\nThe sows which farrowed in January should now be weaned from their pigs,\r\nand should be ready to be mated within a few days. The sows should be\r\ncarefully watched for the signs of heat or restlessness. Some sows give\r\nlittle indication of this unrest, which is almost certain to appear\r\nwithin four or five days providing the sow is in a healthy and vigorous\r\ncondition. To miss the sow means a loss of three weeks of most valuable\r\ntime, besides the risk of trouble in getting the sow to conceive after\r\nshe had been baulked. With the passing of the month swedes and\r\nartichokes will have lost much of their nourishment; mangolds can now\r\ntake their place. It is a good plan to expose the mangolds to the air\r\nfor a few days prior to feeding them to the pigs; this exposure hastens\r\ntheir ripening and reduces the proportion of water. Of course care must\r\nbe taken to prevent them becoming frozen, as in March this might be the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nIn the Southern counties tares, lucerne, and grass are sufficiently\r\nforward towards the end of April to be cut and fed to the pigs which are\r\nconfined in the buildings. The pigs both fat and store will fully repay\r\nthe cost of labour in the cutting and carting of these vegetable foods.\r\nBrood sows both in pig and with litters dependent on them, should be\r\nallowed their liberty in the grass fields. This will both greatly reduce\r\nthe cost of keep and tend to their thrift and well doing. Young pigs\r\nover a month old should have a run out both morning and afternoon. Newly\r\nweaned pigs which have been well done are always in keen request in the\r\nmonths of April and May at prices higher than in any other portion of\r\nthe year, owing to the demand from the cheese-makers who have a\r\nsuperabundance of whey, of which 12 lbs. when fed in proper combination\r\nis considered to be equal in value to 1 lb. of meal. Unfortunately, so\r\nmany dairymen do not study the requirements of the pig, and imagine that\r\nit will give a good return from an excess of liquid in the form of whey.\r\nWithout some concentrated food the pig will not thrive on whey. Numbers\r\nof young pigs are also required in those districts where butter-making\r\nis carried on to consume the butter milk, and in ordinary times much of\r\nthe separated or skim milk. In the feeding of this again the results are\r\nnot so good as they should be owing to neglect. Both foods have been\r\nrendered unbalanced owing to the extraction of the butter fat, so that\r\nalthough new milk may be fed alone, the others require additional food\r\nwhich should contain some oil or fat to be fed with them, or they cause\r\nindigestion and want of thrift, particularly in young and immature pigs.\r\n\r\nThe roots of all kinds, save potatoes and mangolds, have ceased to be of\r\nmuch value before April ends, vetches and lucerne will prove to be the\r\nbest of substitutes. Spring cabbages are generally of more value for\r\nhuman consumption than can be obtained from their use as pig food. If\r\nthere be any grass land available the in-pig sows and the stores, should\r\nthere be such, should now find the major portion of their food out of\r\ndoors.\r\n\r\nAs a rule far too little attention is paid to the growth of lucerne in\r\nthis country. It is undoubtedly one of the most nutritive of our\r\nvegetable crops. It also produces a large weight of food extending over\r\nseveral months, and continues fruitful for many years providing\r\nattention is paid to the keeping it free from grasses. It has the\r\nadditional advantage of furnishing a full supply of food when the\r\nweather is so dry that grass and some other foods produce little. It is\r\ntrue that in the initial stage it requires time and care, but the\r\nresults from it amply repay both. One of the best seasons for sowing it\r\nis the month of May. The operation is simple, the land having been\r\ncleared the seed is sown in drills about 1 ft. apart, the quantity of\r\nseed required being at the rate of 20 lbs. per acre, say 2 oz. per pole\r\nor a drill 35 yards long. As soon as the plants are high enough the land\r\nshould be hand hoed, and if kept free of weeds a light crop can\r\ngenerally be cut from it towards the end of August. In the following\r\nyears it will produce at least three cuttings annually.\r\n\r\nSome persons are of opinion that as lucerne is such a deep-rooted plant\r\nmanure is unnecessary. It is true that the roots penetrate several feet\r\ninto the soil, still an application of short manure or rotted vegetable\r\nmatter applied each autumn will give a good return.\r\n\r\nThe chief point in the use of lucerne for pigs and in the production of\r\na maximum crop is to cut it when young. The pigs will thrive on it far\r\nbetter in this state than when the stalks become hard and sticky. In the\r\nlatter stage it is likely to cause constipation. It is best not to graze\r\nit with either horses, cattle, or pigs, but benefit to it results from\r\nfolding it in the autumn with ewes or other sheep which find most of\r\ntheir other food on the stubbles, commons, heaths, etc.\r\n\r\nAll the sows and the yelts intended for breeding should now spend their\r\nwhole time out of doors. It might be noted that lucerne will grow on\r\nalmost any kind of land providing it is well drained--stagnant water\r\ndestroys it.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the pig-keeper are very similar in the month of June to\r\nthose of the previous month. Prior to the outbreak of war it was\r\nbecoming general amongst the most practical pigmen to continue to fatten\r\npigs all the year round. The old-fashioned idea that pork was not a\r\nsuitable food during any of the months in which there was not the letter\r\n\"r\" had become exploded. Not only did the bacon curers require a supply\r\nof fat pigs weighing from 200 to 220 lbs. alive, but there was a good\r\ndemand from the butchers for small fat pigs weighing from 80 to 140 lbs.\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that a smaller quantity of food is required to\r\nproduce a pound of pork during the summer than during the winter months.\r\nThis has been clearly proved in many experiments. The difference varies\r\naccording to the temperature. In the very cold weather experienced in\r\nsome portions of the United States it was found that some pigs actually\r\nmade no increase in weight when well fed, the whole of the nutriment\r\nhaving to be utilised in keeping up the bodily warmth of the pigs.\r\n\r\nThe months of July and August see little change in the duties of the\r\nattendant on pigs. The old-fashioned plan of running the pigs on the\r\ncorn stubbles has almost gone out of fashion. The improved system of\r\nharvesting the crops leaves less corn on the land, whilst the cost of\r\nlabour in keeping the pigs is almost prohibitive. At one time there used\r\nto be a keen demand for young pigs in the month of August for so-called\r\n\"shacking\" or running on the stubbles. Experience has proved that these\r\npigs pay less frequently under present conditions than they did under\r\nthe old ones.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of vegetable food which usually shows itself in August is\r\nnow, in September, met to a considerable extent by the plan of the early\r\ndigging of potatoes. Large quantities of chats, and sometimes of\r\nslightly diseased ones are now cooked and fed to the pigs with a certain\r\nproportion of meal. As a rule there is a keen demand for pork in the\r\nmonth of September. Towards the end of the month all pigs should be\r\nunder shelter at night.\r\n\r\nDuring the last three months of the year there is little variation in\r\nthe management of pigs. One of the common mistakes made by farmers is to\r\nneglect their pigs in the autumn, at the very season when a little extra\r\nfood is needed, and for which the pigs will give a better return than at\r\nalmost any time of the year. The early portion of October is one of the\r\nbest periods for mating the sows, the yelts may be left until the latter\r\npart of the month so that their pigs do not arrive until the month of\r\nFebruary when the days are lengthening and the sun has more power. It is\r\nadvisable to have many of the fat pigs ready for market ere the month of\r\nNovember ends, as the demand for pork is usually slack for two or three\r\nweeks prior to and after Christmas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE PIG\r\n\r\n\r\nFortunately, the pig is subject to comparatively few serious\r\ndiseases--save swine fever, swine erysipelas, and very occasionally\r\nanthrax, which are contagious or infectious, and all in the special\r\ncharts of the veterinary department of the Board of Agriculture, and\r\nwithin the contagious Diseases Animals Acts. Prior to the stamping out\r\nof Foot and Mouth Disease or apthous fever and rabies, pigs suffered\r\nfrom these contagious and infectious diseases, particularly the former\r\nof the two, which caused immense losses, especially of young pigs,\r\nduring the latter half of the past century.\r\n\r\nOf the other ailments to which pig flesh is heir, the majority and the\r\nchief of them are mainly due to that want of knowledge or care in the\r\nfeeding and in the housing of the pigs which renders them more\r\nsusceptible to the sudden changes in the temperature or to the\r\ninclemency of the season. In former chapters some, if not all, of these\r\nailments have been referred to, but it may be more convenient to our\r\nreaders to include in one chapter a brief description of the ailments\r\nand the remedies and means of prevention.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWINE FEVER\r\n\r\nSome thirty years since the losses from this disease were of so serious\r\na nature that the Board of Agriculture determined to attempt to stamp it\r\nout, as they had succeeded in stamping out pleura pneumonia in cattle,\r\nand foot and mouth disease. The success of their efforts was not at all\r\ncommensurate with the outlay. The failure was attributed to many causes;\r\namongst them the want of a complete knowledge of the disease, the\r\nimpossibility of diagnosing it during the life of the patient, the\r\nabsence of sympathy on the part of the local veterinary surgeons owing\r\nto certain steps taken by the then Veterinary Adviser of the Board, to\r\nwhich further reference is now inadvisable, and to the general\r\nopposition of pig-keepers who had as little faith in many of the post\r\nmortems and their results as in the power of the authorities to stamp\r\nout the disease which under various names had been more or less common\r\nin the country so long as they could remember. Doubts were also passed\r\non the infectivity or contagiousness of swine fever, or as it was\r\nvariously termed red soldier, spots, etc.\r\n\r\nThis disbelief was probably due in part to the fact that some of the\r\nexternal symptoms of swine fever, swine erysipelas, and heart disease,\r\nsuch as discoloration of the skin were of a similar character. In some\r\ninstances this redness of the skin, which was looked upon as a sure sign\r\nthat the pig had died from swine fever, did not prove to be infectious,\r\nas no other cases followed amongst the in-contact pigs. This led to the\r\ngeneral belief that swine fever was not necessarily infectious.\r\nDissatisfaction with the arbitrary manner in which the restrictions in\r\nmovement, etc., were carried out did not mend matters, nor help to\r\nrender the efforts of the Board more successful.\r\n\r\nAt the present time it is imperative on the part of the owner of an ill\r\npig to report the fact to the nearest policeman. The owner then merely\r\ncarries out the instructions supplied to him by the police so that it is\r\nalmost unnecessary to state that the symptoms of swine fever are\r\nseveral. At times the attack is of so virulent a nature that a pig may\r\ntake its food all right in the afternoon and be dead the next morning,\r\nno discoloration of the skin or other external symptoms being visible\r\nbefore or immediately after death.\r\n\r\nAs a rule when the pig is attacked the first symptom is loss of\r\nappetite, generally accompanied by a feverish condition of the skin\r\nwhich shows more or fewer red spots behind the shoulder, and inside the\r\nthighs, or in those portions of the body where the skin is the thinnest\r\nand most free from hair. The great desire of the affected pig is to\r\nburrow into the litter and to remain undisturbed, save when the feverish\r\nthirst impels it to seek moisture of any sort or kind, even urine which\r\nmay have settled into any unevenness of the floor of the sty.\r\n\r\nMany of the ailing pigs suffer from a dry, husky cough, a gummy\r\ndischarge exudes from the eyes and forms a ring round them, the ankles\r\nbecome affected, and the muscles of the back become weakened so that\r\nthe pig has difficulty in walking. The discoloration of the skin may or\r\nmay not increase, but the weakness gradually becomes greater so that\r\ndeath may follow within a day or two from the first attack. Occasionally\r\nthe affected pig will continue to live for several days, and eventually\r\nrecover so much that it can be fatted, but there exists a great risk of\r\nthe recovered pig being what is termed a \"carrier\" of the disease, and\r\npossessing the ability to infect other pigs with which it may come in\r\nclose contact, although the germs of the disease which it carries do not\r\naffect its own health. Similar instances of human beings being\r\n\"carriers\" of the disease have been recorded. So difficult is it at\r\ntimes to discover the source of the infection of swine fever that\r\ncertain persons who are not amongst the strongest believers in the\r\npractical knowledge of the members of the veterinary profession assert\r\nthat swine fever need not necessarily be the result of infection, but\r\nthat injudicious feeding or the neglect of sanitary arrangements will\r\nsometimes cause an outbreak. There does not appear to be the slightest\r\nground for this belief, as there is a specific virus which when it\r\nobtains ingress into the body of the pig, whether by the mouth, nose, or\r\nin any other way, may result in an attack, more or less severe, of swine\r\nfever, unless the virus has become so attenuated that it is unable to\r\naffect the host sufficiently. This attenuation, which is due to causes\r\nwhich are probably not completely known, is commonly the cause of the\r\nabsence of further cases of swine fever amongst one of a lot of pigs\r\nwhich has had a very mild attack. This variation in the virulence of\r\nmost infectious diseases has been noticed and recorded.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the Board of Agriculture have suspended the\r\nslaughter order in cases where the owner of the pigs desires to\r\ninoculate the in-contact pigs with serum which is supplied from the\r\nVeterinary College. The experiment has not been in operation\r\nsufficiently long enough to express a confident opinion upon its\r\nresults, but it is stated that in Denmark the inoculation of the pigs\r\nwhich have been in contact with diseased pigs has proved to be a\r\nsuccess. The risks of carrying out the experiment are by no means\r\nslight, but appear to be worth running if there be any great probability\r\nof success.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWINE ERYSIPELAS\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of this disease, which fortunately is not so common as\r\nswine fever, owing probably to its being more fatal and in a shorter\r\ntime, are very similar to those of swine fever, save that the husky\r\ncough and the weakness of the muscles of the back are generally absent.\r\nThe post mortem shows distinctive differences from those of swine fever.\r\nThere appears to be far greater difficulty in thoroughly disinfecting\r\nthe sty in which pigs suffering from erysipelas have been housed than\r\nafter swine fever cases; not only so, but the virus remains active for a\r\nvery long period, so that any accident which may expose the virus even\r\nafter many months may affect any pigs with which it comes in contact.\r\n\r\nIn an outbreak of swine erysipelas it is advisable to have the\r\nunaffected pigs inoculated as well as those housed in a sty or building\r\nin which at any time pigs suffering from erysipelas have been housed. A\r\ncertain limited number may die, and a few suffer for a time, but the\r\ntotal loss will be considerably reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTHRAX, FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE AND RABIES\r\n\r\nIt may be unnecessary to describe these very infectious or contagious\r\ndiseases to which pigs are subject, as fortunately the steps taken to\r\nstamp them out, and which were much decried when taken by the Board of\r\nAgriculture, have proved so successful that the two latter are stamped\r\nout, and the first named is so promptly and effectually dealt with that\r\na case of it amongst swine is seldom recorded.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRAMP, DIARRH[OE]A AND EPILEPTIC FITS\r\n\r\nThese diseases, which are more frequent amongst young pigs, have been\r\nfully described in the chapters dealing with the rearing, weaning, and\r\ngrowing of pigs, where it is pointed out that they are all mainly due to\r\nfaults in feeding, and the simple remedies applicable are there given.\r\n\r\nHernia and Scrotal Hernia are also treated upon in the chapter on the\r\nFarrowing Sow.\r\n\r\n\r\nINVERSION OF THE VAGINA OR THE UTERUS\r\n\r\nThese two troubles, of which the latter is a complete expulsion and the\r\nformer only a partial protrusion of the \"breeding bag,\" are generally\r\nthe result of a difficult or a protracted farrowing. The second is\r\nalmost impossible of treatment, and indeed may be declared as fatal, so\r\nthat the loss may be reduced by prompt slaughter.\r\n\r\nThe first varies in extent; a partial or limited inversion may at times\r\nbe noticeable during the latter stages of pregnancy, and then after\r\ndelivery may disappear without treatment until the pressure due to the\r\nincreasing size of the f[oe]tus again causes it. Even in serious cases\r\nwhich attend the delivery and are due to excessive straining of the sow,\r\nthe attack is not necessarily fatal if extreme care in treatment is\r\napplied. The first thing is to wash the protruding part with warm water,\r\nto which some disinfectant has been added, in order that all dirt, short\r\nstraw, etc., shall be removed. The sow should then be made to rise, or\r\nif she refuses, as is not uncommon, the hind quarters of the sow should\r\nbe raised and the protruding portion be gently but firmly forced back.\r\nIn order to prevent a re-expulsion stitches with strong cord or leather\r\nlace should be inserted into the edges of the vulva--these need not be\r\nvery close together or otherwise the sow would be unable to make water.\r\nFor a few days the sow must be kept as quiet as possible and fed on a\r\nlittle nourishing but laxative food, so that the pressure on the vagina\r\nis slight until the muscles regain their normal strength. Should there\r\nbe the slightest symptom of constipation, salts or castor oil should be\r\ngiven to the sow. No harm, but rather good, will attend the giving of a\r\ngentle dose of salts at the first time of feeding after the operation as\r\nthere is certain to be an amount of inflammation present.\r\n\r\n\r\nINVERSION OF THE RECTUM\r\n\r\nThis expulsion of the gut as it is commonly termed is not often\r\nexperienced amongst mature pigs. Young pigs are not uncommonly affected\r\nsave when constipation is neglected, or when the food is of a heating\r\nnature which causes continual difficulty on the part of the pig in\r\nexpelling the faeces. The effort of straining causes the gut to exude.\r\nSimilar treatment, save as to the stitching of the part, as with\r\ninversion of the vagina, should be followed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTENDER FEET\r\n\r\nThis trouble is frequently mistaken for cramp or rheumatism, and is\r\ngenerally due to the same causes, injudicious feeding, etc. In the\r\nlatter disease the ankles are mainly affected, in the case of fever in\r\nthe feet, the feet only are affected. A strong dose of Epsom salts\r\nshould be given and daily doses of nitre should be given in the food.\r\nThe object should be to reduce and remove the fever and then to cure or\r\nremove that tenderness and soreness of the feet which follows the fever.\r\nPoulticing the feet and applying diluted white oils by adding equal\r\nquantities of water and vinegar around the coronets are both remedial\r\nmeasures of great value.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTIPATION\r\n\r\nThis trouble is very common amongst pigs which are confined to the\r\nsties, its avoidance is comparatively easy, when the want of exercise is\r\nthe sole cause. A run in an enclosure or even in the road will almost\r\nalways result in the pig evacuating dung and water. A dose of salts,\r\nvarying from 1/2 oz. to 1-1/2 oz. for each pig, according to age, in the\r\nnext supply of food is advisable.\r\n\r\nConstipation is usually the first indication of many of the troubles to\r\nwhich the pig is heir. The little pig on its mother becomes constipated\r\nwhen the food fed to the mother is unsuitable, and the pig suffers from\r\nindigestion; fever caused by a chill is also foretold by constipation\r\nwhich should be first removed by a gentle dose of salts or of castor\r\noil; the last only to be used in severe cases. Linseed oil is also\r\nfrequently used to relieve the constipation, but with this there is a\r\nfear of billiousness following its use. If exercise and the above\r\nremedies do not effect a cure, an enema of soap and water or even\r\nglycerine may be necessary. Old-fashioned pigmen remove the hard and\r\nknotty faeces by the aid of the finger.\r\n\r\n\r\nECZEMA\r\n\r\nThis is sometimes called a skin disease, but it appears to be rather a\r\nsymptom of a severe attack of indigestion or of billiousness than a\r\ndisease in itself. It shows itself in the form of a bright red spot,\r\nvarying in size from that of a threepenny piece to that of a shilling,\r\nthese spots vary greatly in number. Small pimples appear on the spots\r\nfrom which a sticky fluid exudes. As soon as the bowels are thoroughly\r\nrelieved by aperient medicine, the spots become dark in colour and peel\r\noff the skin. The application of oil to the spots hastens the shedding\r\nof them. A dose of sulphur of one to eight drachms in addition to the\r\nsalts will be beneficial.\r\n\r\nFrequently the pig will refuse to eat, it will then be necessary to dose\r\nit. The pig must be caught, its head raised and the liquid gently poured\r\ndown its throat, the greatest care being taken not to pour the liquid\r\nwhilst the pig is squealing or the medicine will go into the lungs and\r\ncause suffocation, or inflammation of the lungs which will generally\r\nprove fatal.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASLES\r\n\r\nThis is a trouble of a very similar character to eczema save that the\r\nred spots are more numerous and of a more irritating character. The\r\npatient is continually rubbing itself against the wall or any prominence\r\nin an endeavour to relieve the itching. The pig is also more feverish.\r\nThe pig should be placed in a warm sty, with plenty of dry straw, into\r\nwhich it will quickly burrow. A dose of Epsom salts to which is added a\r\nsmall quantity of spirit of nitre should be given, as the pig affected\r\nwill almost invariably refuse food for a time. Neat's foot or sweet oil\r\napplied to the spots will relieve the irritation.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICKETS\r\n\r\nThis is not by any means a common ailment amongst pigs, but it is very\r\nhereditary. The most common cause is too close breeding. The bones and\r\njoints appear to be unequal to the performance of their duties, the pig\r\nstaggers and stumbles when it attempts to move, whilst sometimes the\r\nback is affected, when the pig is stated to be suffering from\r\n\"swayback.\" As a rule treatment is inadvisable as recovery is doubtful.\r\nThe first loss by knocking the pig on the head is generally the least.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUBERCULOSIS\r\n\r\nPigs, like unto human beings, are much subject to tuberculosis when they\r\nare kept under conditions similar to those which result in human beings\r\nbecoming affected. The disease is highly infectious, pigs coming in\r\ncontact with or even being housed in sties where pigs affected have been\r\nrecently kept are very likely to become infected. Some persons declare\r\nthat tuberculosis, or, as it is more commonly called, consumption, is\r\nhereditary. For this there does not appear to be any foundation. The\r\nchief thing to prevent one's animals being affected is to keep them away\r\nfrom contagion. Although many parts of the body may be attacked by\r\ntuberculosis, the lungs are more frequently affected than any other of\r\nthe organs, owing probably to the ease with which infection by the\r\nminute germ is conveyed to the lungs in the act of breathing.\r\n\r\nIn the past a considerable number of pigs became infected through being\r\nfed on skim milk which contained germs from the udder of a cow suffering\r\nfrom a tuberculous udder. In these cases of the lungs and the bowels\r\nbecoming tubercular, the pigs become unthrifty and frequently waste away\r\nand die. When the bones and other portions of the body are attacked the\r\ndevelopment of the disease is not so rapid, but in any case the wisest\r\nplan is to destroy the animal and thoroughly disinfect the place in\r\nwhich it has been kept. Save when the disease is local and of very\r\nlimited duration the meat of a pig suffering from tuberculosis is unfit\r\nfor human consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORMS\r\n\r\nPigs are subject to various kinds of worms. Of these the most serious by\r\nfar is the worm which causes the disease called Trichinosis in man. The\r\nworms are transmitted to man in pork from a diseased pig. Thorough\r\ncooking of meat appears to destroy the vitality of the worm, but in\r\nforeign countries where the pork is eaten in an uncooked or an\r\nundercooked condition the disease is not uncommon. Fortunately,\r\nTrichinosis is almost unknown in this country, owing to our more\r\nstringent sanitary conditions, the disease being due in the pig to the\r\neating of human excrement in which are thread worms.\r\n\r\nThe most common kind of pig worm in this country is the round white\r\nworm, pointed at both ends. Its length varies from one to several\r\ninches. Its presence is often unsuspected until one or more of the worms\r\nare noticed in the dung of the pig. It is readily got rid of by keeping\r\nthe pigs from food for at least twelve hours, and then giving them a\r\nlittle tempting food in which a dose of santonine, varying from three to\r\nten grains for each pig, according to its age, has been added. Some two\r\nhours later a dose of castor oil of from 1/4 oz. to 2 oz., or of one to\r\ntwo ounces of Epsom salts, should be given in milk or some other\r\ntempting food. Similar treatment will prove successful in the case of\r\npigs affected with the smaller kind of worms save that of the worm which\r\ncauses what is commonly known as \"husk.\" This worm makes its home in the\r\nwindpipe and bronchial tubes. It is advisable to obtain from a chemist a\r\ndrench for the riddance of this worm, as the remedies will consist of\r\nlinseed oil, turpentine, spirits of camphor, and asaf[oe]tida.\r\n\r\n\r\nSORE TEATS\r\n\r\nOccasionally the teats of sows, especially sows with their first\r\nlitters, become chapped or sore. This trouble is frequently due to the\r\ntoo vigorous sucking of the little pigs when the supply of milk is\r\nshort, to the biting of the teats when the sharp little teeth have not\r\nbeen broken off, or even to cold winds.\r\n\r\nAn application of boro-glyceride will usually effect a speedy cure. In\r\npersistent cases it will be advisable to give the sow a dose or two of\r\nopening medicine such as salts or sulphur.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALT AND SODA POISONING\r\n\r\nAlthough these can scarcely be classed as diseases, the effects are\r\noften more serious than those of some actual diseases to which swine are\r\nmore or less subject.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of cases the cause is the neglect of the cook to keep\r\nseparate from the swill the water in which salted meat or other food has\r\nbeen boiled, or the water to which soda has been added in the washing\r\nof the plates, etc. An attack if at all severe is usually fatal.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms are a discoloration of the skin, and a refusal of food. As\r\nthese are the usual symptoms of several other ailments, it is difficult\r\nto determine the cause of death save by a post-mortem examination. It is\r\nto be feared that this mixing of a solution of salt and soda with the\r\nother swill will be one of the difficulties met with in the more general\r\nutilisation of kitchen refuse in the keeping of pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE CURING OF PORK\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the good old times bacon curing was carried on in the large majority\r\nof farm-houses as well as in many houses in the country districts, not\r\nonly where there were conveniences for the keeping of pigs, but many\r\nhouseholders were in the habit of buying carcases of pork from their\r\nneighbours and curing the major portion for the following year's supply\r\nof cured meats. Even the better class labourers would kill and cure it\r\nso that as long as it lasted they had on hand a supply of most\r\nnutritious and suitable food. Unfortunately a great change has taken\r\nplace of late years; this convenient and profitable plan has been\r\nsuperseded. The causes may have been many; amongst them, the importation\r\nof immense quantities of salt pork of very inferior quality at very low\r\nprices from the United States; the change in the public taste which is\r\nnow for mild cured and lean bacon from young pigs, instead of the more\r\nheavily salted meats from older and fatter pigs; the great decrease in\r\nthe number of pigs kept by cottagers and others in urban districts\r\nthrough the operation of the so-called sanitary regulations; and\r\nprobably from the different style of living, which may or may not be an\r\nimprovement, amongst the residents in country districts.\r\n\r\nIt may be that one of the many changes which have been brought about by,\r\nand which will also follow, the war will be a return to the more simple\r\nand less luxurious manner of living. It is certain that a more\r\neconomical system will have to be followed, and one of the means of\r\neffecting this may be a return to the keeping of pigs during their\r\ngrowing stage on the house and garden refuse, and then when the pigs\r\nhave been fattened, by the killing and curing of the carcase for home\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written during recent years about the folly of allowing so\r\nmany millions of sovereigns to go out of the country in payment for the\r\nvast weight of bacon, hams, and lard which we import from foreign\r\ncountries. Residents in the country have been blamed by town residents\r\nand literary men for their alleged want of enterprise in not breeding\r\nand fattening the few extra million pigs which would furnish an amount\r\nof pig produce equal to that imported, and thus, as they declare, save\r\nthe country that outlay which is a dead loss to these islands.\r\n\r\nIt may at once be frankly admitted that a very considerable increase in\r\nthe number of our pig population is possible without any very greatly\r\nextended cost of food, but when it is contended that farmers and even\r\ncottagers are grossly neglectful in not producing sufficient pork and\r\nits products for the use of the whole of the population of these\r\nislands, an injustice is done, as the breeding and feeding of pigs is a\r\nbusiness calling, not a philanthropical pursuit. Farmers and cottagers\r\nare like other manufacturers of necessary articles; they produce in\r\norder to live, and they cease to manufacture an article when its\r\nproduction ceases to repay them for their outlay and trouble. They must\r\nof necessity do so, or they come to grief and are unable to carry on\r\ntheir farms or businesses.\r\n\r\nIt matters not what the cause be for the ability of the foreigner to\r\nproduce and land on our markets articles cheaper than we can afford to\r\noffer them at, the result is the same--the home production is\r\nautomatically reduced. There are many causes which have helped to render\r\nit possible for foreigners to supply us with a certain proportion of the\r\npork and bacon which we require at a less cost than our home breeder and\r\nfeeders of pigs can supply it. These include help to the farmers from\r\nthe Governments of certain countries such as Denmark, where assistance\r\nis given in the purchase of pure bred pigs for the improvement of the\r\nnative pigs, in the reduced railway and other rates on the transit of\r\npigs, foods, and bacon, in the provision of certain foods, and in\r\ncarrying out experiments in order to show how they may be utilised in\r\nthe best manner. Stud farms have also been established from which pure\r\nbred boars are distributed, whilst the whole industry of pig breeding\r\nand bacon curing is carried on under the supervision and with the advice\r\nof many Government officials appointed for the purpose. The intrinsic\r\nvalue of this assistance is perceptible, as in no other country are\r\npig-keeping and bacon curing carried on with greater monetary success\r\nthan in Denmark.\r\n\r\nIt is also asserted that the general system of farming in Denmark has\r\nalso contributed very largely to the phenomenal prosperity of the pig\r\nindustry, in that a very large proportion of the land is owned and\r\nfarmed by comparatively small farmers, men who have a direct interest in\r\nthe improvement of the land, and who with their families perform the\r\nmajor portion of the work on the land and in attendance on the stock.\r\nThe land is almost certain to be well managed and the stock to receive\r\nthe best possible attention with, comparatively speaking, little cost as\r\nto labour. The animals on the farm are likely to be of a higher grade\r\nand the returns from them of an increased character, than when strangers\r\nand disinterested hired labour attend and feeds them.\r\n\r\nAnother of the great advantages possessed by some of our foreign\r\ncompetitors is the very much better supply of feeding stuffs and their\r\nvery considerably lower cost. Take the United States, for instance, the\r\nenormous supply of maize alone enables American pigmen to manufacture\r\npork at a cost which enables the packers to land bacon, hams, and lard\r\non the British shores which our home pig producers cannot approach.\r\nAlthough it cannot be said that the cost of labour is less in the States\r\nthan in England, yet there are some countries from which we import pork\r\nproducts where the labour is far more plentiful and less costly. In the\r\nfuture the allowance for labour will have to be on a more liberal scale\r\nthan hitherto when estimating the cost of producing pork, unless the\r\nnumber of persons owning and occupying small holdings is greatly\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that our home producers of pork and bacon will obtain\r\na considerable advantage in the future in that the freight on the\r\nimported meats will be so much higher. It is most probable that this\r\nwill increase the expense of landing bacon, etc., on our markets; on the\r\nother hand, as we import so large a proportion of the pig fattening\r\nfoods, the cost of food will most likely be increased to quite the same\r\nif not to a greater extent. The only plan to reduce this extra expense\r\nwill be to lessen the outlay on imported foods by paying more attention\r\nto the growth of various foods suitable for pigs, attending more\r\ncarefully to our pigs and feeding them on common-sense lines. In these\r\nparticulars there is room for much improvement in many piggeries.\r\n\r\nBy reducing the cost of the production of pork and by the more general\r\nadoption of the system of home curing we shall not only obtain our bacon\r\nat less cost, but we shall have a far greater amount of the finest\r\nquality of bacon and hams generally available. We imagine that the\r\nreader of the earlier portion of this book will experience little\r\ndifficulty in producing fine quality pork at a minimum cost--it will\r\nthen remain to cure and dry it properly.\r\n\r\nThe fattened pig should not be fed for some twenty-four hours before it\r\nis killed; after slaughter the carcase should remain hanging until it\r\nis thoroughly cooled. The manner of cutting up will depend on the\r\ncustom in the particular district. In some parts of the country the pig\r\nis split down, the head, feet, and tail taken off, the leaf and kidneys\r\nand the skirt taken out, the loin and the crop with a certain proportion\r\nof the lean cut off, and in some cases the shoulder blade is drawn;\r\nafter the necessary trimming a Wiltshire side remains.\r\n\r\nIn other districts the ham and the shoulder are cut off and the side is\r\nconverted into a middle, a ham and a shoulder or fore-ham. The jowls are\r\ntaken off the head and salted with the bacon and hams. The upper part of\r\nthe head, or, as it is commonly termed, the scorf, is usually used with\r\nthe feet in the manufacture of brawn, or, as it is sometimes called,\r\npork cheese--presumably from its being cooled in a form, and then turned\r\nout on to the dish on which it is served at table.\r\n\r\nThe first operation in curing is to distribute a small quantity of salt\r\nall over the meat to be cured. If allowed to remain about forty-eight\r\nhours the blood remaining in the meat will have become dissolved, and\r\nwill have exuded from the carcase. This liquid should be thrown away. A\r\nmixture in the proportion of 4 lbs. salt, 1 lb. coarse brown sugar, 1\r\noz. saltpetre, 1/4 oz. bay salt, and 1/4 oz. salt prunell should be\r\nprepared, and a portion of it be applied to all parts of the meat and\r\nparticularly in the pocket hole, if the shoulder blade has been drawn.\r\nThis should be continued for from twenty to thirty days, according to\r\nthe thickness of the meat and the degree of saltness desired. In one or\r\ntwo districts of a limited area it is usual to rub the meat somewhat\r\nviolently with a large pebble when applying the salt mixture, the\r\nalleged object being to rub in the salt; but for this there is not the\r\nslightest necessity as the result of the rubbing is nil, since the salt\r\nwill penetrate the meat equally as well without the manipulation as with\r\nit. The principal point is to secure the distribution of the salt to\r\nevery part of the meat so that the salt can penetrate and preserve it.\r\n\r\nWhen sufficiently cured the meat should be hung up and dried. If it be\r\ndesired to have it smoked this is best done at the village bakery or\r\nsmoke drying house. Smoking of hams and bacon is possible on a small\r\nscale with the aid of a smoke oven such as supplied by Messrs. Douglas\r\nand Sons of Putney, but it is, as a rule, cheaper and less troublesome\r\nto send the meat to the village smoking house. It will be advisable to\r\nbrand or otherwise mark each piece of cured meat sent to be smoked, as\r\nthe return of the same pieces is thus assured.\r\n\r\nWhere the home curing of bacon and hams is followed, this is best\r\ncarried out from the middle of October to the end of March; if it be\r\nattempted earlier or later a cold chamber is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of salt pork is carried on all the year through as the\r\nmeat is usually kept in the brine, where it will keep perfectly good for\r\na considerable time providing it is perfectly sweet when first placed in\r\nthe brine. To secure this it is advisable to have the pig killed in the\r\nevening, covered over with a cloth to prevent the flies approaching it,\r\nand hanging it in a cool place so that all the natural heat has escaped\r\nere it is cut up and placed in the pickle pot. It may be advisable to\r\nnote that the last is only possible with a small pig during the hot\r\nweather. In the mere salting of pork it is usual to use only salt and\r\nsaltpetre. The use of sugar should be avoided in the summer, as its use\r\nis likely to result in fermentation in hot weather.\r\n\r\nThere are two other points in connection with bacon curing on which a\r\nchange of opinion has taken place, or is taking place. These are the\r\ncause of what are called in the trade \"seedy bellies,\" and the effect on\r\nthe bacon of the female fat pig being in a state of [oe]strum when it is\r\nslaughtered. Until quite recently the first of these troubles, and it is\r\na most serious one to the trade, was generally considered to be due to\r\nthe second. It was believed by curers that the slight inflammation\r\nnoticeable in the mammary glands of the female pig when she is in heat\r\nresulted in these so-called \"seedy bellies\" if the pig was in that\r\ncondition when she was slaughtered. This belief may have been either the\r\ncause or the result, or both, of the common saying that the meat of a\r\nsow pig killed when it was in heat will not take the salt properly, and\r\nthat it is therefore advisable to wait until this natural condition has\r\npassed away before the pig is slaughtered. This contention has been one\r\nof the arguments used when the spaying of sow pigs has been advocated.\r\nOf late years comparatively few sow pigs have been spayed, so that the\r\nunspayed fat pigs have been nearly as numerous as those male pigs which\r\nhave been castrated, and as the sow pigs come in heat each three weeks,\r\nand continue so for from three to five days, a very considerable\r\nproportion of them must be in heat when they are slaughtered at the\r\nlarge bacon-curing factories, without any loss resulting. We may,\r\ntherefore, assume that it matters little whether the pig be in heat or\r\nnot when it is slaughtered unless the seedy bellies result.\r\n\r\nOn this point also the verdict is against the common belief, as Messrs.\r\nMackenzie and Marsh have carried out a series of investigations at\r\nCambridge which clearly proved that seedy bellies were equally as common\r\nwhen the sow pigs were not in heat and when they were; but that the\r\ndiscoloration which resembles numbers of small spots of colour varying\r\nfrom dark blue to light red in the mammary glands is merely an excess of\r\npigment, the darker shade being common in pigs with dark coloured hair\r\nand skin such as the Large Blacks, Berkshires, etc., and the lighter\r\nshade in pigs of the Tamworth breed. In the bacon manufactured from pigs\r\nwith a white skin and white hair there is no discoloration or seedy\r\nbellies.\r\n\r\nAlthough it has been generally considered by bacon curers that pigs of a\r\nwhite colour were preferable for their trade, and this to such an extent\r\nthat some of the bacon curers in Ireland will pay a slightly higher\r\nprice for a pig with a white skin, the preference was generally\r\nconsidered to be due to the more presentable appearance of a side of\r\nbacon from a white than from a black pig; it would appear that in the\r\nfuture a still greater preference will be observable when it becomes\r\ngenerally known that the bacon made from white pigs is free from seedy\r\nbellies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_To make money out of Pigs_\r\n\r\nOne must go on the NON-STOP PRINCIPLE, every little check to growth\r\nmeans so much less profit.

Mr. Woodward has that gift of humour without which all writing\r\non nature is a weariness unto the flesh for young readers, and for many\r\nreaders who are no longer young. Mr. J. A. Shepherd's illustrations\r\ncatch the spirit of the letterpress, and are of a piece with the work\r\nthat has made his reputation as an artist.\"--_Literary World._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_May be had of all Booksellers or will be sent direct on receipt of\r\npublished price and postage from_\r\n\r\nC.
