The\r\nregion is of especial interest, both because of its striking scenery,\r\nand because it illustrates clearly many of the principles involved in\r\nthe evolution of the geography of land surfaces.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the region is an undulating plain, above which rise\r\na few notable elevations, chief among which are the Baraboo quartzite\r\nranges, marked by diagonal lines on Plates I and II. These elevations\r\nhave often been described as two ranges. The South or main range lies\r\nthree miles south of Baraboo, while the North or lesser range, which is\r\nfar from continuous, lies just north of the city.\r\n\r\nThe main range has a general east-west trend, and rises with bold and\r\nsometimes precipitous slopes 500 to 800 feet above its surroundings. A\r\ndeep gap three or four miles south of Baraboo (Plates II, V, and\r\nXXXVII) divides the main range into an eastern and a western\r\nportion, known respectively as the _East and West bluffs_ or _ranges_.\r\nIn the bottom of the gap lies Devil's lake (i, Plate II and Plate\r\nXXXVII), perhaps the most striking body of water of its size in the\r\nstate, if not in the whole northern interior. A general notion of the\r\ntopography of a small area in the immediate vicinity of the lake may be\r\nobtained from Plate XXXVII.\r\n\r\nThe highest point in the range is about four miles east of the lake, and\r\nhas an elevation of more than 1,600 feet above sea level, more than\r\n1,000 feet above Lake Michigan, and about 800 feet above the Baraboo\r\nvalley at its northern base. The eastward extension of the west range\r\n(Plate XXXVII) lying south of the lake, and popularly known as the\r\n_Devil's nose_, reaches an elevation of a little more than 1,500 feet.\r\n\r\nThe lesser or North quartzite range (Plate II) rises 300 feet to 500\r\nfeet above its surroundings. It assumes considerable prominence at the\r\nUpper and Lower narrows of the Baraboo (b and c, Plate II, c, Plate\r\nXXXVII and Plate IV). The North range is not only lower than the\r\nSouth range, but its slopes are generally less steep, and, as Plate II\r\nshows, it is also less continuous. The lesser elevation and the gentler\r\nslopes make it far less conspicuous. About three miles southwest of\r\nPortage (Plate II) the North and South ranges join, and the elevation at\r\nthe point of union is about 450 feet above the Wisconsin river a few\r\nmiles to the east.\r\n\r\nThe lower country above which these conspicuous ridges rise, has an\r\naverage elevation of about 1,000 feet above the sea, and extends far\r\nbeyond the borders of the area with which this report is concerned. The\r\nrock underlying it in the vicinity of Baraboo is chiefly sandstone, but\r\nthere is much limestone farther east and south, in the area with which\r\nthe Baraboo region is topographically continuous. Both the sandstone and\r\nlimestone are much less resistant than the quartzite, and this\r\ndifference has had much to do with the topography of the region.\r\n\r\nThe distinctness of the quartzite ridges as topographic features is\r\nindicated in Plate XXXVII by the closeness of the contour lines on their\r\nslopes. The same features are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, which represent\r\nprofiles along two north-south lines passing through Baraboo and\r\nMerrimac respectively.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL.

THE PLAIN SURROUNDING THE QUARTZITE RIDGES.\r\n\r\n_Topography._--As seen from the top of the quartzite ridges, the\r\nsurrounding country appears to be an extensive plain, but at closer\r\nrange it is seen to have considerable relief although there are\r\nextensive areas where the surface is nearly flat.\r\n\r\nThe relief of the surface is of two somewhat different types. In some\r\nparts of the area, especially in the western part of the tract shown on\r\nPlate II, the surface is made up of a succession of ridges and valleys.\r\nThe ridges may be broken by depressions at frequent intervals, but the\r\nvalleys are nowhere similarly interrupted. It would rarely be possible\r\nto walk along a ridge or \"divide\" for many miles without descending into\r\nvalleys; but once in a valley in any part of the area, it may be\r\ndescended without interruption, until the Baraboo, the Wisconsin, the\r\nMississippi, and finally the gulf is reached. In other words, the\r\ndepressions are continuous, but the elevations are not. This is the\r\nfirst type of topography.\r\n\r\nWhere this type of topography prevails its relation to drainage is\r\nevident at a glance. All the larger depressions are occupied by streams\r\ncontinuously, while the smaller ones contain running water during some\r\npart of the year. The relations of streams to the depressions, and the\r\nwear which the streams effect, whether they be permanent or temporary,\r\nsuggest that running water is at least one of the agencies concerned in\r\nthe making of valleys.\r\n\r\nAn idea of the general arrangement of the valleys, as well as many\r\nsuggestions concerning the evolution of the topography of the broken\r\nplain in which they lie might be gained by entering a valley at its\r\nhead, and following it wherever it leads. At its head, the valley is\r\nrelatively narrow, and its slopes descend promptly from either side in\r\nsuch a manner that a cross-section of the valley is V-shaped. In places,\r\nas west of Camp Douglas, the deep, steep-sided valleys are found to lead\r\ndown and out from a tract of land so slightly rolling as to be well\r\nadapted to cultivation. Following down the valley, its progressive\r\nincrease in width and depth is at once evident, and at the same time\r\nsmall tributary valleys come in from right and left. At no great\r\ndistance from the heads of the valleys, streams are found in their\r\nbottoms.\r\n\r\nAs the valleys increase in width and depth, and as the tributaries\r\nbecome more numerous and wider, the topography of which the valleys are\r\na feature, becomes more and more broken. At first the tracts between the\r\nstreams are in the form of ridges, wide if parallel valleys are distant\r\nfrom one another, and narrow if they are near. The ridges wind with the\r\nvalleys which separate them. Whatever the width of the inter-stream\r\nridges, it is clear that they must become narrower as the valleys\r\nbetween them become wider, and in following down a valley a point is\r\nreached, sooner or later, where the valleys, main and tributary, are of\r\nsuch size and so numerous that their slopes constitute a large part of\r\nthe surface. Where this is true, and where the valleys are deep, the\r\nland is of little industrial value except for timber and grazing. When,\r\nin descending a valley system, this sort of topography is reached, the\r\nroads often follow either the valleys or the ridges, however indirect\r\nand crooked they may be. Where the ridges separating the valleys in such\r\na region have considerable length, they are sometimes spoken of as \"hog\r\nbacks.\" Still farther down the valley system, tributary valleys of the\r\nsecond and lower orders cross the \"hog backs,\" cutting them into hills.\r\n\r\nBy the time this sort of topography is reached, a series of flats is\r\nfound bordering the streams. These flats may occur on both sides of the\r\nstream, or on but one. The topography and the soil of these flats are\r\nsuch as to encourage agriculture, and the river flats or alluvial plains\r\nare among the choicest farming lands.\r\n\r\nWith increasing distance from the heads of the valleys, these river\r\nplains are expanded, and may be widened so as to occupy the greater part\r\nof the surface. The intervening elevations are there relatively few and\r\nsmall. Their crests, however, often rise to the same level as that of\r\nthe broader inter-stream areas farther up the valleys. The relations of\r\nthe valleys and the high lands separating them, is such as to suggest\r\nthat there are, generally speaking, two sets of flat surfaces, the\r\nhigher one representing the upland in which the valleys lie, the lower\r\none representing the alluvial plains of the streams. The two sets of\r\nflats are at once separated and connected by slopes. At the head of a\r\ndrainage system, the upland flats predominate; in the lower courses, the\r\nriver plains; in an intermediate stage, the slopes are more conspicuous\r\nthan either upper or lower flat.\r\n\r\nSouthwest from Devil's lake and northwest from Sauk City, in the valley\r\nof Honey creek, and again in the region southwest from Camp Douglas, the\r\ntopography just described is well illustrated. In both these localities,\r\nas in all others where this type of topography prevails, the intimate\r\nrelations of topography and drainage cannot fail to suggest that the\r\nstreams which are today widening and deepening the valleys through which\r\nthey flow, had much to do with their origin and development. This\r\nhypothesis, as applied to the region under consideration, may be tested\r\nby the study of the structure of the plain.\r\n\r\nThe second type of topography affecting the plain about the quartzite\r\nranges is found east of a line running from Kilbourn City to a point\r\njust north of Prairie du Sac. Though in its larger features the area\r\neast of this line resembles that to the west, its minor features are\r\nessentially different. Here there are many depressions which have no\r\noutlets, and marshes, ponds, and small lakes abound. Not only this, but\r\nmany of the lesser elevations stand in no definite relation to valleys.\r\nThe two types of topography make it clear that they were developed in\r\ndifferent ways.\r\n\r\n_Structure._--Examination of the country surrounding the Baraboo ridges\r\nshows that its surface is underlaid at no great depth by horizontal or\r\nnearly horizontal beds of sandstone and limestone (see Plates XVI,\r\nXXVIII, and Frontispiece). These beds are frequently exposed on opposite\r\nsides of a valley, and in such positions the beds of one side are found\r\nto match those on the other. This is well shown along the narrow valley\r\nof Skillett creek just above the \"Pewit's nest.\" Here the swift stream\r\nis rapidly deepening its channel, and it is clear that a few years\r\nhence, layers of sandstone which are now continuous beneath the bed of\r\nthe creek will have been cut through, and their edges will appear on\r\nopposite sides of the valley just as higher layers do now. Here the most\r\nskeptical might be convinced that the layers of rock on either side of\r\nthe narrow gorge were once continuous across it, and may see, at the\r\nsame time, the means by which the separation was effected. Between the\r\nslight separation, here, where the valley is narrow, and the great\r\nseparation where the valleys are wide, there are all gradations. The\r\nstudy of progressively wider valleys, commencing with such a gorge as\r\nthat referred to, leaves no room for doubt that even the wide valleys,\r\nas well as the narrow ones, were cut out of the sandstone by running\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL. AND NAT. HIST. SURVEY. BULLETIN NO. V.,\r\nPL. III.\r\n\r\nIllustration: FIG. 1.\r\n\r\nRipple marks on a slab of Potsdam sandstone.\r\n\r\nIllustration: FIG. 2.\r\n\r\nPiece of Potsdam conglomerate. The larger pebbles are about three inches\r\nin diameter.]\r\n\r\nThe same conclusion as to the origin of the valleys may be reached in\r\nanother way. Either the beds of rock were formed with their present\r\ntopography, or the valleys have been excavated in them since they were\r\nformed. Their mode of origin will therefore help to decide between these\r\nalternatives.\r\n\r\n_Origin of the sandstone and limestone._--The sandstone of the region,\r\nknown as the Potsdam sandstone, consists of medium sized grains of\r\nsand, cemented together by siliceous, ferruginous, or calcareous cement.\r\nIf the cement were removed, the sandstone would be reduced to sand, in\r\nall respect similar to that accumulating along the shores of seas and\r\nlakes today.\r\n\r\nThe surfaces of the separate layers of sandstone are often distinctly\r\nripple-marked (Fig. 1, Pl. III), and the character of the markings is\r\nidentical in all essential respects with the ripples which affect the\r\nsurface of the sand along the shores of Devil's lake, or sandy beaches\r\nelsewhere, at the present time. These ripple marks on the surfaces of\r\nthe sandstone layers must have originated while the sand was movable,\r\nand therefore before it was cemented into sandstone.\r\n\r\nIn the beds of sandstone, fossils of marine animals are found. Shells,\r\nor casts of shells of various sorts are common, as are also the tracks\r\nand burrowings of animals which had no shells. Among these latter signs\r\nof life may be mentioned the borings of worms. These borings are not now\r\nalways hollow, but their fillings are often so unlike the surrounding\r\nrock, that they are still clearly marked. These worm borings, like the\r\nripple marks, show that the sand was once loose.\r\n\r\nThe basal beds of the sandstone are often conglomeratic. The\r\nconglomeratic layers are made up of water-worn pieces of quartzite,\r\nPlate III, Fig. 2, ranging in size from small pebbles to large bowlders.\r\nThe interstices of the coarse material are filled by sand, and the whole\r\ncemented into solid rock. The conglomeratic phase of the sandstone may\r\nbe seen to advantage at Parfrey's glen (a, Plate XXXVII) and Dorward's\r\nglen, (b, same plate) on the East bluff of Devil's lake above the Cliff\r\nHouse, and at the Upper narrows of the Baraboo, near Ablemans. It is\r\nalso visible at numerous other less accessible and less easily\r\ndesignated places.\r\n\r\nFrom these several facts, viz.: the horizontal strata, the ripple-marks\r\non the surfaces of the layers, the fossils, the character of the sand,\r\nand the water-worn pebbles and bowlders of the basal conglomerate,\r\npositive conclusions concerning the origin of the formation may be\r\ndrawn.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement in definite layers proves that the formation is\r\nsedimentary; that is, that its materials were accumulated in water\r\nwhither they had been washed from the land which then existed. The\r\nripple-marks show that the water in which the beds of sand were\r\ndeposited was shallow, for in such water only are ripple-marks made.[1]\r\nOnce developed on the surface of the sand they may be preserved by\r\nburial under new deposits, just as ripple-marks on sandy shores are now\r\nbeing buried and preserved.\r\n\r\n    [1] Ripple marks are often seen on the surface of wind-blown\r\n    sand, but the other features of this sandstone show that this\r\n    was not its mode of accumulation.\r\n\r\nThe conglomerate beds of the formation corroborate the conclusions to\r\nwhich the composition and structure of the sandstone point. The\r\nwater-worn shapes of the pebbles and stones show that they were\r\naccumulated in water, while their size shows that the water must have\r\nbeen shallow, for stones of such sizes are handled only by water of such\r\nslight depth that waves or strong currents are effective at the bottom.\r\nFurthermore, the large bowlders show that the source of supply\r\n(quartzite) must have been close at hand, and that therefore land\r\ncomposed of this rock must have existed not far from the places where\r\nthe conglomerate is found.\r\n\r\nThe fossils likewise are the fossils of aquatic life. Not only this, but\r\nthey are the fossils of animals which lived in salt water. The presence\r\nof salt water, that is, the sea, in this region when the sand of the\r\nsandstone was accumulating, makes the wide extent of the formation\r\nrational.\r\n\r\nFrom the constitution and structure of the sandstone, it is therefore\r\ninferred that it accumulated in shallow sea water, and that, in the\r\nvicinity of Devil's lake, there were land masses (islands) of quartzite\r\nwhich furnished the pebbles and bowlders found in the conglomerate beds\r\nat the base of the formation.\r\n\r\nThis being the origin of the sandstone, it is clear that the layers\r\nwhich now appear on opposite sides of valleys must once have been\r\ncontinuous across the depressions; for the sand accumulated in shallow\r\nwater is never deposited so as to leave valleys between ridges. It is\r\ndeposited in beds which are continuous over considerable areas.\r\n\r\nWithin the area under consideration, limestone is much less widely\r\ndistributed than sandstone. Thin beds of it alternate with layers of\r\nsandstone in the upper portion of the Potsdam formation, and more\r\nmassive beds lie above the sandstone on some of the higher elevations of\r\nthe plain about the quartzite ridge. This is especially true in the\r\nsouthern and southwestern parts of the region shown on Plate II. The\r\nlimestone immediately overlying the sandstone is the _Lower Magnesian_\r\nlimestone.\r\n\r\nThe beds of limestone, like those of the sandstone beneath, are\r\nhorizontal or nearly so, and the upper formation lies conformably on the\r\nlower. The limestone does not contain water-worn pebbles, and the\r\nsurfaces of its layers are rarely if ever ripple-marked; yet the\r\narrangement of the rock in distinct layers which carry fossils of marine\r\nanimals shows that the limestone, like the sandstone beneath, was laid\r\ndown in the sea. The bearing of this origin of the limestone on the\r\ndevelopment of the present valleys is the same as that of the sandstone.\r\n\r\n_Origin of the topography._--The topography of the plain surrounding the\r\nquartzite ridges, especially that part lying west of Devil's lake, is\r\nthen an erosion topography, developed by running water. Its chief\r\ncharacteristic is that every depression leads to a lower one, and that\r\nthe form of the elevations, hills or ridges, is determined by the\r\nvalleys. The valleys were made; the hills and ridges left. If the\r\nmaterial carried away by the streams could be returned, the valleys\r\nwould be filled to the level of the ridges which bound them. Were this\r\ndone, the restored surface would be essentially flat. It is the\r\nsculpturing of such a plain, chiefly by running water, which has given\r\nrise to the present topography.\r\n\r\nIn the development of this topography the more resistant limestone has\r\nserved as a capping, tending to preserve the hills and ridges. Thus many\r\nof the hills, especially in the southwest portion of the area shown in\r\nPlate II, are found to have caps of the Lower Magnesian formation. Such\r\nhills usually have flat tops and steep or even precipitous slopes down\r\nto the base of the capping limestone, while the sandstone below,\r\nweathering more readily, gives the lower portions of the hills a gentler\r\nslope.\r\n\r\nThe elevations of the hills and ridges above the axes of the valleys or,\r\nin other words, the relief of the plain is, on the average, about 300\r\nfeet, only a few of the more prominent hills exceeding that figure.\r\n\r\nThe topography east of the line between Kilbourn City and Prairie du Sac\r\nis not of the unmodified erosion type, as is made evident by marshes,\r\nponds and lakes. The departure from the erosion type is due to a mantle\r\nof glacial drift which masks the topography of the bedded rock beneath.\r\nIts nature, and the topographic modifications which it has produced, will\r\nbe more fully considered in a later part of this report.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL. AND NAT. HIST. SURVEY. BULLETIN NO. V.,\r\nPL. IV.\r\n\r\nThe Lower Narrows of the Baraboo from a point on the South range.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                 II. THE QUARTZITE RIDGES.\r\n\r\n_Topography._--The South or main quartzite range, about 23 miles in\r\nlength and one to four miles in width, rises 500 feet to 800 feet above\r\nthe surrounding sandstone plain. Its slopes are generally too steep for\r\ncultivation, and are clothed for the most part with a heavy growth of\r\ntimber, the banks of forest being broken here and there by cultivated\r\nfields, or by the purple grey of the rock escarpments too steep for\r\ntrees to gain a foothold. With the possible exception of the Blue mounds\r\nsouthwest of Madison, this quartzite range is the most obtrusive\r\ntopographic feature of southern Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nAs approached from the south, one of the striking features of the range\r\nis its nearly even crest. Extending for miles in an east-west direction,\r\nits summit gives a sky-line of long and gentle curves, in which the\r\nhighest points are but little above the lowest. Viewed from the north,\r\nthe evenness of the crest is not less distinct, but from this side it is\r\nseen to be interrupted by a notable break or notch at Devil's lake\r\n(Plates V and XXXVII). The pass across the range makes a right-angled\r\nturn in crossing the range, and for this reason is not seen from the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nThe North or lesser quartzite range lying north of Baraboo is both\r\nnarrower and lower than the south range, and its crest is frequently\r\ninterrupted by notches or passes, some of which are wide. Near its\r\neastern end occurs the striking gap known as the _Lower narrows_ (Plate\r\nIV) through which the Baraboo river escapes to the northward, flowing\r\nthence to the Wisconsin. At this narrows the quartzite bluffs rise\r\nabruptly 500 feet above the river. At a and b, Plate II, there are\r\nsimilar though smaller breaks in the range, also occupied by streams.\r\nThe connection between the passes and streams is therefore close.\r\n\r\nThere are many small valleys in the sides of the quartzite ranges\r\n(especially the South range) which do not extend back to their crests,\r\nand therefore do not occasion passes across them. The narrow valleys at\r\na and b in Plate XXXVII, known as Parfrey's and Dorward's glens,\r\nrespectively, are singularly beautiful gorges, and merit mention as well\r\nfrom the scenic as from the geologic point of view. Wider valleys, the\r\nheads of which do not reach the crest, occur on the flanks of the main\r\nrange (as at d and e, Plate II) at many points. One such valley\r\noccurs east of the north end of the lake (x, Plate XXXVII), another\r\nwest of the south end (y, Plate XXXVII), another on the north face of\r\nthe west bluff west of the north end of the lake and between the East\r\nand West Sauk roads, and still others at greater distances from the lake\r\nin both directions. It is manifest that if the valleys were extended\r\nheadward in the direction of their axes, they would interrupt the even\r\ncrest. Many of these valleys, unlike the glens mentioned above, are very\r\nwide in proportion to their length. In some of these capacious valleys\r\nthere are beds of Potsdam sandstone, showing that the valleys existed\r\nbefore the sand of the sandstone was deposited.\r\n\r\n_The structure and constitution of the ridges._--The quartzite of the\r\nridges is nothing more nor less than altered sandstone. Its origin dates\r\nfrom that part of geological time known to geologists as the Upper\r\nHuronian period. The popular local belief that the quartzite\r\nis of igneous origin is without the slightest warrant. It appears to\r\nhave had its basis in the notion that Devil's lake occupies an extinct\r\nvolcanic crater. Were this the fact, igneous rock should be found about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nQuartzite is sandstone in which the intergranular spaces have been\r\nfilled with silica (quartz) brought in and deposited by percolating\r\nwater subsequent to the accumulation of the sand. The conversion of\r\nsandstone into quartzite is but a continuation of the process which\r\nconverts sand into sandstone. The Potsdam or any other sandstone\r\nformation might be converted into quartzite by the same process, and it\r\nwould then be a _metamorphic_ rock.\r\n\r\nLike the sandstone, the quartzite is in layers. This is perhaps nowhere\r\nso distinctly shown on a large scale as in the bluffs at Devil's lake,\r\nand at the east end of the Devil's nose. On the East bluff of the lake,\r\nthe stratification is most distinctly seen from the middle of the lake,\r\nfrom which point the photograph reproduced in Plate VI was taken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL. AND NAT. HIST. SURVEY. BULLETIN NO. V.,\r\nPL. V.\r\n\r\nThe Notch in the South quartzite range, at Devil's Lake.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL. AND NAT. HIST. SURVEY. BULLETIN NO. V.,\r\nPL. VI.\r\n\r\nThe east bluff of Devil's lake, showing the dip of quartzite (to the\r\nleft), and talus above and below the level where the beds are shown.]\r\n\r\nUnlike the sandstone and limestone, the beds of quartzite are not\r\nhorizontal. The departure from horizontality, technically known as the\r\n_dip_, varies from point to point (Fig. 4). In the East bluff of the\r\nlake as shown in Plate VI, the dip is about 14 deg. to the north. At the\r\nUpper and Lower narrows of the Baraboo (b and c, Plate II) the beds\r\nare essentially vertical, that is, they have a dip of about 90 deg.. Between\r\nthese extremes, many intermediate angles have been noted. Plate VII\r\nrepresents a view near Ablemans, in the Upper narrows, where the nearly\r\nvertical beds of quartzite are well exposed.\r\n\r\nThe position of the beds in the quartzite is not always easy of\r\nrecognition. The difficulty is occasioned by the presence of numerous\r\ncleavage planes developed in the rock after its conversion into\r\nquartzite. Some of these secondary cleavage planes are so regular and so\r\nnearly parallel to one another as to be easily confused with the bedding\r\nplanes. This is especially liable to make determinations of the dip\r\ndifficult, since the true bedding was often obscured when the cleavage\r\nwas developed.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the difficulties, the original stratification can usually be\r\ndetermined where there are good exposures of the rock. At some points\r\nthe surfaces of the layers carry ripple marks, and where they are\r\npresent, they serve as a ready means of identifying the bedding planes,\r\neven though the strata are now on edge. Layers of small pebbles are\r\nsometimes found. They were horizontal when the sands of the quartzite\r\nwere accumulating, and where they are found they are sufficient to\r\nindicate the original position of the beds.\r\n\r\nAside from the position of the beds, there is abundant evidence of\r\ndynamic action[2] in the quartzite. Along the railway at Devil's lake,\r\nhalf a mile south of the Cliff House, thin zones of schistose rock may\r\nbe seen parallel to the bedding planes. These zones of schistose rock a\r\nfew inches in thickness were developed from the quartzite by the\r\nslipping of the rock on either side. This slipping presumably occurred\r\nduring the adjustment of the heavy beds of quartzite to their new\r\npositions, at the time of tilting and folding, for no thick series of\r\nrock can be folded without more or less slipping of the layers on one\r\nanother. The slipping (adjustment) takes place along the weaker zones.\r\nSuch zones of movement are sometimes known as _shear zones_, for the\r\nrock on the one side has been sheared (slipped) over that on the other.\r\n\r\n    [2] Irving: \"The Baraboo Quartzite Ranges.\" Vol. II, Geology\r\n    of Wisconsin, pp. 504-519.

VIII.\r\n\r\nVertical shear zone in face of east bluff at Devil's lake.]\r\n\r\nNear the shear zones parallel to the bedding planes, there is one\r\ndistinct vertical shear zone (Plate VIII) three to four feet in width.\r\nIt is exposed to a height of fully twenty-five feet. Along this zone the\r\nquartzite has been broken into angular fragments, and at places the\r\ncrushing of the fragments has produced a \"friction clay.\" Slipping along\r\nvertical zones would be no necessary part of folding, though it might\r\naccompany it. On the other hand, it might have preceded or followed the\r\nfolding.\r\n\r\nSchistose structure probably does not always denote shearing, at least\r\nnot the shearing which results from folding. Extreme pressure is likely\r\nto develop schistosity in rock, the cleavage planes being at right\r\nangles to the direction of pressure. It is not always possible to say\r\nhow far the schistosity of rock at any given point is the result of\r\nshear, and how far the result of pressure without shear.\r\n\r\nSchistose structure which does not appear to have resulted from shear,\r\nat least not from the shear involved in folding, is well seen in the\r\nisolated quartzite mound about four miles southwest of Baraboo on the\r\nWest Sauk road (f, Plate II). These quartzite schists are to be looked\r\non as metamorphosed quartzite, just as quartzite is metamorphosed\r\nsandstone.\r\n\r\nAt the Upper narrows of the Baraboo also (b, Plate II), evidence\r\nof dynamic action is patent. Movement along bedding planes with\r\nattendant development of quartz schist has occurred here as at the lake\r\n(Plate IX). Besides the schistose belts, a wide zone of quartzite\r\nexposed in the bluffs at this locality has been crushed into angular\r\nfragments, and afterwards re-cemented by white quartz deposited from\r\nsolution by percolating waters (Plate X). This quartzite is said to be\r\nbrecciated. Within this zone there are spots where the fragments of\r\nquartzite are so well rounded as to simulate water-worn pebbles. Their\r\nforms appear to be the result of the wear of the fragments on one\r\nanother during the movements which followed the crushing. Conglomerate\r\noriginating in this way is _friction conglomerate_ or _Reibungsbreccia_.\r\n\r\nThe crushing of the rock in this zone probably took place while the beds\r\nwere being folded; but the brecciated quartzite formed by the\r\nre-cementation of the fragments has itself been fractured and broken in\r\nsuch a manner as to show that the formation has suffered at least one\r\ndynamic movement since the development of the breccia. That these\r\nmovements were separated by a considerable interval of time is shown by\r\nthe fact that the re-cementation of the fragmental products of the first\r\nmovement preceded the second.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said expresses the belief of geologists as to the origin\r\nof quartzite and quartz schists; but because of popular misconception on\r\nthe point it may here be added that neither the changing of the\r\nsandstone into quartzite, nor the subsequent transformation of the\r\nquartzite to schist, was due primarily to heat. Heat was doubtless\r\ngenerated in the mechanical action involved in these changes, but it was\r\nsubordinate in importance, as it was secondary in origin.\r\n\r\nIgneous rock is associated with the quartzite at a few points. At g\r\nand h, Plate II there are considerable masses of porphyry,\r\nsustaining such relations to the quartzite as to indicate that they were\r\nintruded into the sedimentary beds after the deposition of the latter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL.

RELATIONS OF THE SANDSTONE OF THE PLAIN TO THE QUARTZITE OF THE\r\n                            RIDGES.\r\n\r\nThe horizontal beds of Potsdam sandstone may be traced up to the bases\r\nof the quartzite ranges, where they may frequently be seen to abut\r\nagainst the tilted beds of quartzite. Not only this, but isolated\r\npatches of sandstone lie on the truncated edges of the dipping beds of\r\nquartzite well up on the slopes, and even on the crest of the ridge\r\nitself. In the former position they may be seen on the East bluff at\r\nDevil's lake, where horizontal beds of conglomerate and sandstone rest\r\non the layers of quartzite which dip 14 deg. to the north.\r\n\r\nThe stratigraphic relations of the two formations are shown in Fig. 5\r\nwhich represents a diagrammatic section from A to B, Plate II. Plate XI\r\nis reproduced from a photograph taken in the Upper narrows of the\r\nBaraboo near Ablemans, and shows the relations as they appear in the\r\nfield. The quartzite layers are here on edge, and on them rest the\r\nhorizontal beds of sandstone and conglomerate. Similar stratigraphic\r\nrelations are shown at many other places. This is the relationship of\r\n_unconformity_.\r\n\r\nSuch an unconformity as that between the sandstone and the quartzite of\r\nthis region shows the following sequence of events: (1) the quartzite\r\nbeds were folded and lifted above the sea in which the sand composing\r\nthem was originally deposited; (2) a long period of erosion followed,\r\nduring which the crests of the folds were worn off; (3) the land then\r\nsank, allowing the sea to again advance over the region; (4) while the\r\nsea was here, sand and gravel derived from the adjacent lands which\r\nremained unsubmerged, were deposited on its bottom. These sands became\r\nthe Potsdam sandstone.\r\n\r\nThis sequence of events means that between the deposition of the\r\nquartzite and the sandstone, the older formation was disturbed and\r\neroded. Either of these events would have produced an unconformity; the\r\ntwo make it more pronounced. That the disturbance of the older formation\r\ntook place before the later sandstone was deposited is evident from the\r\nfact that the latter formation was not involved in the movements which\r\ndisturbed the former.\r\n\r\nAlthough the sandstone appears in patches on the quartzite ranges, it is\r\nprimarily the formation of the surrounding plains, occupying the broad\r\nvalley between the ranges, and the territory surrounding them. The\r\nquartzite, on the other hand, is the formation of the ridges, though it\r\noutcrops at a few points in the plain. (Compare Plates II and XXXVII.)\r\nThe striking topographic contrasts between the plains and the ridges is\r\nthus seen to be closely related to the rock formations involved. It is\r\nthe hard and resistant quartzite which forms the ridges, and the less\r\nresistant sandstone which forms the lowlands about them.\r\n\r\nThat quartzite underlies the sandstone of the plain is indicated by the\r\noccasional outcrops of the former rock on the plain, and from the fact\r\nthat borings for deep wells have sometimes reached it where it is not\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\nThe sandstone of the plain and the quartzite of the ridges are not\r\neverywhere exposed. A deep but variable covering of loose material or\r\n_mantle rock (drift)_ is found throughout the eastern part of the area,\r\nbut it does not extend far west of Baraboo. This mantle rock is so thick\r\nand so irregularly disposed that it has given origin to small hills and\r\nridges. These elevations are superimposed on the erosion topography of\r\nthe underlying rock, showing that the drift came into the region after\r\nthe sandstone, limestone, and quartzite had their present relations, and\r\nessentially their present topography. Further consideration will be\r\ngiven to the drift in a later part of this report.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL. AND NAT. HIST. SURVEY. BULLETIN NO. V.,\r\nPL.

THE PRE-CAMBRIAN HISTORY OF THE QUARTZITE.\r\n\r\n_From loose sand to quartzite._--To understand the geography of a region\r\nit is necessary to understand the nature of the materials, the sculpture\r\nof which has made the geography.\r\n\r\nIt has already been indicated that the Huronian quartzite of\r\nwhich the most prominent elevations of this region are composed, was\r\nonce loose sand. Even at the risk of repetition, the steps in its\r\nhistory are here recounted. The source of the sand was probably the\r\nstill older rocks of the land in the northern part of Wisconsin. Brought\r\ndown to the sea by rivers, or washed from the shores of the land by\r\nwaves, the sand was deposited in horizontal or nearly horizontal beds at\r\nthe bottom of the shallow water which then covered central and southern\r\nWisconsin. Later, perhaps while it was still beneath the sea, the sand\r\nwas converted into sandstone, the change being effected partly by\r\ncompression which made the mass of sand more compact, but chiefly by the\r\ncementation of its constituent grains into a coherent mass. The water\r\ncontained in the sand while consolidation was in progress, held in\r\nsolution some slight amount of silica, the same material of which the\r\ngrains of sand themselves are composed. Little by little this silica in\r\nsolution was deposited on the surfaces of the sand grains, enlarging\r\nthem, and at the same time binding them together. Thus the sand became\r\nsandstone. Continued deposition of silica between and around the grains\r\nfinally filled the interstitial spaces, and when this process was\r\ncompleted, the sandstone had been converted into quartzite. While\r\nquartzite is a metamorphic sandstone, it is not to be understood that\r\nsandstone cannot be metamorphosed in other ways.\r\n\r\n_Uplift and deformation. Dynamic metamorphism._--After the deposition of\r\nthe sands which later became the quartzite, the beds were uplifted and\r\ndeformed, as their present positions and relations show. It is\r\nnot possible to say how far the process of transformation of sand into\r\nquartzite was carried while the formation was still beneath the shallow\r\nsea in which it was deposited. The sand may have been changed to\r\nsandstone, and the sandstone to quartzite, before the sea bottom was\r\nconverted into land, while on the other hand, the formation may have\r\nbeen in any stage of change from sand to quartzite, when that event\r\noccurred. If the process of change was then incomplete, it may have been\r\ncontinued after the sea retired, by the percolating waters derived from\r\nthe rainfall of the region.\r\n\r\nEither when first converted into land, or at some later time, the beds\r\nof rock were folded, and suffered such other changes as attend profound\r\ndynamic movements. The conversion of the sandstone into quartzite\r\nprobably preceded the deformation, since many phenomena indicate that\r\nthe rock was quartzite and not sandstone when the folding took place.\r\nFor example, the crushing of the quartzite (now re-cemented into\r\nbrecciated quartzite) at Ablemans probably dates from the orogenic\r\nmovements which folded the quartzite, and the fractured bits of rock\r\noften have corners and edges so sharp as to show that the rock was\r\nthoroughly quartzitic when the crushing took place.\r\n\r\nThe uplift and deformation of the beds was probably accomplished slowly,\r\nbut the vertical and highly tilted strata show that the changes were\r\nprofound (see Fig. 4).\r\n\r\nThe dynamic metamorphism which accompanied this profound deformation has\r\nalready been referred to. The folding of the beds involved the\r\nslipping of some on others, and this resulted in the development of\r\nquartz schist along the lines of severest movement. Changes effected in\r\nthe texture and structure of the rock under such conditions constitute\r\n_dynamic metamorphism_. In general, the metamorphic changes effected\r\nby dynamic action are much more profound than those brought about in\r\nother ways, and most rocks which have been profoundly metamorphosed,\r\nwere changed in this way. Dynamic action generates heat, but contrary to\r\nthe popular notion, the heat involved in profound metamorphism is\r\nusually secondary, and the dynamic action fundamental.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that quartz schist was locally developed from the\r\nquartzite, crushing probably occurred in other places. This is\r\n_demorphism_, rather than metamorphism.\r\n\r\n_Erosion of the quartzite._--When the Huronian beds were raised to the\r\nestate of land, the processes of erosion immediately began to work on\r\nthem. The heat and the cold, the plants and the animals, the winds, and\r\nespecially the rain and the water which came from the melting of the\r\nsnow, produced their appropriate effects. Under the influence of these\r\nagencies the surface of the rock was loosened by weathering, valleys\r\nwere cut in it by running water, and wear and degradation went on at all\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nThe antagonistic processes of uplift and degradation went on for\r\nunnumbered centuries, long enough for even the slow processes involved\r\nto effect stupendous results. Degradation was continuous after the\r\nregion became land, though uplift may not have been. On the whole,\r\nelevation exceeded degradation, for some parts of the quartzite finally\r\ncame to stand high above the level of the sea,--the level to which all\r\ndegradation tends.\r\n\r\nFig. 4 conveys some notion of the amount of rock which was\r\nremoved from the quartzite folds about Baraboo during this long period\r\nof erosion. The south range would seem to represent the stub of one side\r\nof a great anticlinal fold, a large part of which (represented by the\r\ndotted lines) was carried away, while the north range may be the core of\r\nanother fold, now exposed by erosion.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the geography of the quartzite at the close of this period\r\nof erosion may be gained by imagining the work of later times undone.\r\nThe younger beds covering the quartzite of the plains have a thickness\r\nvarying from zero to several hundred feet, and effectually mask the\r\nirregularities of the surface of the subjacent quartzite. Could they be\r\nremoved, the topography of the quartzite would be disclosed, and found\r\nto have much greater relief than the present surface; that is, the\r\nvertical distance between the crest of the quartzite ridge, and the\r\nsurface of the quartzite under the surrounding lowlands, would be\r\ngreater than that between the same crest and the surface of the\r\nsandstone. But even this does not give the full measure of the relief of\r\nthe quartzite at the close of the long period of erosion which followed\r\nits uplift, for allowance must be made for the amount of erosion which\r\nthe crests of the quartzite ranges have suffered since that time. The\r\npresent surface therefore does not give an adequate conception of the\r\nirregularity of the surface at the close of the period of erosion which\r\nfollowed the uplift and deformation of the quartzite. So high were the\r\ncrests of the quartzite ranges above their surroundings at that time,\r\nthat they may well be thought of as mountainous. From this point of\r\nview, the quartzite ranges of today are the partially buried mountains\r\nof the pre-Potsdam land of south central Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nWhen the extreme hardness of the quartzite is remembered and also the\r\nextent of the erosion which affected it (Fig. 4) before the next\r\nsucceeding formation was deposited, it is safe to conclude that the\r\nperiod of erosion was very long.\r\n\r\n_Thickness of the quartzite._--The thickness of the quartzite is not\r\nknown, even approximately. The great thickness in the south range\r\nsuggested by the diagram (Fig. 4) may perhaps be an exaggeration.\r\nFaulting which has not been discovered may have occurred, causing\r\nrepetition of beds at the surface (Fig. 6), and so an exaggerated\r\nappearance of thickness. After all allowances have been made, it is\r\nstill evident that the thickness of the quartzite is very great.\r\n\r\n\r\n             II. THE HISTORY OF THE PALEOZOIC STRATA.\r\n\r\n_The subsidence._--Following the long period of erosion, the irregular\r\nand almost mountainous area of central Wisconsin was depressed\r\nsufficiently to submerge large areas which had been land. The subsidence\r\nwas probably slow, and as the sea advanced from the south, it covered\r\nfirst the valleys and lowlands, and later the lower hills and ridges,\r\nwhile the higher hills and ridges of the quartzite stood as islands in\r\nthe rising sea. Still later, the highest ridges of the region were\r\nthemselves probably submerged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--A diagrammatic cross-section, showing how, by\r\nfaulting, the apparent thickness of the quartzite would be increased.]\r\n\r\n_The Potsdam sandstone (and conglomerate)._--So soon as the sea began to\r\noverspread the region, its bottom became the site of deposition, and the\r\ndeposition continued as long as the submergence lasted. It is to the\r\nsediments deposited during the earlier part of this submergence that the\r\nname _Potsdam_ is given.\r\n\r\nThe sources of the sediments are not far to seek. As the former land was\r\ndepressed beneath the sea, its surface was doubtless covered with the\r\nproducts of rock decay, consisting of earths, sands, small bits and\r\nlarger masses of quartzite. These materials, or at least the finer\r\nparts, were handled by the waves of the shallow waters, for they were at\r\nfirst shallow, and assorted and re-distributed. Thus the residuary\r\nproducts on the submerged surface, were one source of sediments.\r\n\r\nFrom the shores also, so long as land areas remained, the waves derived\r\nsediments. These were composed in part of the weathered products of the\r\nrock, and in part of the undecomposed rock against which the waves\r\nbeat, after the loose materials had been worn away. These sediments\r\nderived from the shore were shifted, and finally mingled with those\r\nderived from the submerged surface.\r\n\r\nSo long as any part of the older land remained above the water, its\r\nstreams brought sediments to the sea. These also were shifted by the\r\nwaves and shore currents, and finally deposited with the others on the\r\neroded surface of the quartzite. Thus sediments derived in various ways,\r\nbut inherently essentially similar, entered into the new formation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Diagram to illustrate the theoretical\r\ndisposition of sediments about an island.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Same as Fig. 7, except that the land has been\r\ndepressed.]\r\n\r\nThe first material to be deposited on the surface of the quartzite as it\r\nwas submerged, was the coarsest part of the sediment. Of the sediment\r\nderived by the waves from the coasts, and brought down to the sea by\r\nrivers, the coarsest would at each stage be left nearest the shore,\r\nwhile the finer was carried progressively farther and farther from it.\r\nThus at each stage the sand was deposited farther from the shore than\r\nthe gravel, and the mud farther than the sand, where the water was so\r\ndeep that the bottom was subject to little agitation by waves. The\r\ntheoretical distribution of sediments about an island as it was\r\ndepressed, is illustrated by the following diagrams, Figs. 7 and 8. It\r\nwill be seen that the surface of the quartzite is immediately overlain\r\nby conglomerate, but that the conglomerate near its top is younger than\r\nthat near its base.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with this natural distribution of sediments, the basal\r\nbeds of the Potsdam formation are often conglomeratic (Fig. 9, Plate\r\nIII, Fig. 2, and Plate XXV). This may oftenest be seen near\r\nthe quartzite ridges, for here only is the base of the formation\r\ncommonly exposed. The pebbles and larger masses of the conglomerate are\r\nquartzite, like that of the subjacent beds, and demonstrate the source\r\nof at least some of the material of the younger formation. That the\r\npebbles and bowlders are of quartzite is significant, for it shows that\r\nthe older formation had been changed from sandstone to quartzite, before\r\nthe deposition of the Potsdam sediments. The sand associated with the\r\npebbles may well have come from the breaking up of the quartzite, though\r\nsome of it may have been washed in from other sources by the waters in\r\nwhich the deposition took place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Sketch showing relation of basal Potsdam\r\nconglomerate and sandstone to the quartzite, on the East bluff at\r\nDevil's lake, behind the Cliff house.]\r\n\r\nThe basal conglomerate may be seen at many places, but nowhere about\r\nDevil's lake is it so well exposed as at Parfrey's glen (a, Plate\r\nXXXVII), where the rounded stones of which it is composed vary\r\nfrom pebbles, the size of a pea, to bowlders more than three feet in\r\ndiameter. Other localities where the conglomerates may be seen to\r\nadvantage are Dorward's glen (b, Plate XXXVII), the East bluff at\r\nDevil's lake just above the Cliff house, and at the Upper narrows of the\r\nBaraboo, above Ablemans.\r\n\r\nWhile the base of the Potsdam is conglomeratic in many places, the main\r\nbody of it is so generally sandstone that the formation as a whole is\r\ncommonly known as the Potsdam sandstone.\r\n\r\nThe first effect of the sedimentation which followed submergence was to\r\neven up the irregular surface of the quartzite, for the depressions in\r\nthe surface were the first to be submerged, and the first to be filled.\r\nAs the body of sediment thickened, it buried the lower hills and the\r\nlower parts of the higher ones. The extent to which the Potsdam\r\nformation buried the main ridge may never be known. It may have buried\r\nit completely, for as already stated patches of sandstone are\r\nfound upon the main range. These patches make it clear that some\r\nformation younger than the quartzite once covered essentially all of the\r\nhigher ridge. Other evidence to be adduced later, confirms this\r\nconclusion. It has, however, not been demonstrated that the high-level\r\npatches of sandstone are Potsdam.\r\n\r\nThere is abundant evidence that the subsidence which let the Potsdam\r\nseas in over the eroded surface of the Huronian quartzite was gradual.\r\nOne line of evidence is found in the cross-bedding of the sandstone\r\n(Plate XII) especially well exhibited in the Dalles of the Wisconsin.\r\nThe beds of sandstone are essentially horizontal, but within the\r\nhorizontal beds there are often secondary layers which depart many\r\ndegrees from horizontality, the maximum being about 24 deg.. Plates XXVII\r\nand XII give a better idea of the structure here referred to than\r\nverbal description can.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of cross-bedding is to be found in the varying\r\nconditions under which sand was deposited. Cross-bedding denotes shallow\r\nwater, where waves and shore currents were effective at the bottom where\r\ndeposition is in progress. For a time, beds were deposited off shore at\r\na certain angle, much as in the building of a delta (Fig. 10). Then by\r\nsubsidence of the bottom, other layers with like structure were\r\ndeposited over the first. By this sequence of events, the dip of the\r\nsecondary layers should be toward the open water, and in this region\r\ntheir dip is generally to the south. At any stage of deposition the waves\r\nengendered by storms were liable to erode the surface of the deposits\r\nalready made, and new layers, discordant with those below, were likely\r\nto be laid down upon them. The subordinate layers of each deposit might\r\ndip in any direction. If this process were repeated many times during\r\nthe submergence, the existing complexity would be explained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL. AND NAT. HIST. SURVEY. BULLETIN NO. V.,\r\nPL. XII.\r\n\r\nSteamboat rock,--an island in the Dalles of the Wisconsin.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--A diagrammatic cross-section of a delta.]\r\n\r\nThe maximum known thickness of the Potsdam sandstone in Wisconsin is\r\nabout 1,000 feet, but its thickness in this region is much less. Where\r\nnot capped by some younger formation, its upper surface has suffered\r\nextensive erosion, and the present thickness therefore falls short of\r\nthe original. The figures given above may not be too great for the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\n_The Lower Magnesian limestone._--The conditions of sedimentation\r\nfinally changed in the area under consideration. When the sand of the\r\nsandstone was being deposited, adjacent lands were the source whence the\r\nsediments were chiefly derived. The evidence that the region was sinking\r\nwhile the sand was being deposited shows that the land masses which were\r\nsupplying the sand, were becoming progressively smaller. Ultimately the\r\nsand ceased to be washed out to the region here described, either\r\nbecause the water became too deep[3] or because the source of supply\r\nwas too distant. When these relations were brought about, the conditions\r\nwere favorable for the deposition of sediments which were to become\r\nlimestone. These sediments consisted chiefly of the shells of marine\r\nlife, together with an unknown amount of lime carbonate precipitated\r\nfrom the waters of the sea. The limestone contains no coarse, and but\r\nlittle fine material derived from the land, and the surfaces of its\r\nlayers are rarely if ever ripple-marked. The materials of which it is\r\nmade must therefore have been laid down in quiet waters which were\r\nessentially free from land-derived sediments. The depth of the water in\r\nwhich it was deposited was not, however, great, for the fossils are not\r\nthe remains of animals which lived in abysmal depths.\r\n\r\n    [3] A few hundred feet would suffice.\r\n\r\nThe deposition of limestone sediments following the deposition of the\r\nPotsdam sands, does not necessarily mean that there was more or\r\ndifferent marine life while the younger formation was making, but only\r\nthat the shells, etc., which before had been mingled with the sand,\r\nmaking fossiliferous sandstone, were now accumulated essentially free\r\nfrom land-derived sediment, and therefore made limestone.\r\n\r\nLike the sandstone beneath, the limestone formation has a wide\r\ndistribution outside the area here under discussion, showing that\r\nconditions similar to those of central Wisconsin were widely distributed\r\nat this time.\r\n\r\nThe beds of limestone are conformable on those of the sandstone, and the\r\nconformable relations of the two formations indicate that the deposition\r\nof the upper followed that of the lower, without interruption.\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the Lower Magnesian limestone varies from less than 100\r\nto more than 200 feet, but in this region its thickness is nearer the\r\nlesser figure than the larger. The limestone is now present only in the\r\neastern and southern parts of the area, though it originally covered the\r\nwhole area.\r\n\r\n_The St. Peters sandstone._--Overlying the Lower Magnesian limestone at\r\na few points, are seen remnants of St. Peters sandstone. The\r\nconstitution of this formation shows that conditions of sedimentation\r\nhad again changed, so that sand was again deposited where the conditions\r\nhad been favorable to the deposition of limestone but a short time\r\nbefore. This formation has been recognized at but two places (d and\r\ne) within the area shown on Plate XXXVII, but the relations at these\r\ntwo points are such as to lead to the conclusion that the formation may\r\nonce have covered the entire region. This sandstone formation is very\r\nlike the sandstone below. Its materials doubtless came from the lands\r\nwhich then existed. The formation is relatively thin, ranging from\r\nsomewhat below to somewhat above 100 feet.\r\n\r\nThe change from the deposition of limestone sediments to sand may well\r\nhave resulted from the shoaling of the waters, which allowed the sand to\r\nbe carried farther from shore. Rise of the land may have accompanied the\r\nshoaling of the waters, and the higher lands would have furnished more\r\nand coarser sediments to the sea.\r\n\r\n_Younger beds._--That formations younger than the St. Peters sandstone\r\nonce overlaid this part of Wisconsin is almost certain, though no\r\nremnants of them now exist. Evidence which cannot be here detailed[4]\r\nindicates that sedimentation about the quartzite ridges went on not only\r\nuntil the irregularities of surface were evened up, but until even the\r\nhighest peaks of the quartzite were buried, and that formations as high\r\nin the series as the Niagara limestone once overlay their crests. Before\r\nthis condition was reached, the quartzite ridges had of course ceased to\r\nbe islands, and at the same time had ceased to be a source of supply of\r\nsediments. The aggregate thickness of the Paleozoic beds in the region,\r\nas first deposited, was probably not less than 1,500 feet, and it may\r\nhave been much more. This thickness would have buried the crests of the\r\nquartzite ridges under several hundred feet of sediment (see Fig. 11).\r\n\r\n    [4] Jour. of Geol., Vol. III (pp. 655-67).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--The geological formations of southern Wisconsin\r\nin the order of their occurrence. Not all of these are found about\r\nDevil's lake.]\r\n\r\nIt is by no means certain that south central Wisconsin was continuously\r\nsubmerged while this thick series of beds was being deposited. Indeed,\r\nthere is good reason to believe that there was at least one period of\r\nemergence, followed, after a considerable lapse of time, by\r\nre-submergence and renewed deposition, before the Paleozoic series of\r\nthe region was complete. These movements, however, had little effect on\r\nthe geography of the region.\r\n\r\nFinally the long period of submergence, during which several changes in\r\nsedimentation had taken place, came to an end, and the area under\r\ndiscussion was again converted into land.\r\n\r\n_Time involved._--Though it cannot be reduced to numerical terms, the\r\ntime involved in the deposition of these several formations of the\r\nPaleozoic must have been very long. It is probably to be reckoned in\r\nmillions of years, rather than in denominations of a lower order.\r\n\r\n_Climatic conditions._--Little is known concerning the climate of this\r\nlong period of sedimentation. Theoretical considerations have usually\r\nbeen thought to lead to the conclusion that the climate during this part\r\nof the earth's history was uniform, moist, and warm; but the conclusion\r\nseems not to be so well founded as to command great confidence.\r\n\r\n_The uplift._--After sedimentation had proceeded to some such extent as\r\nindicated, the sea again retired from central Wisconsin. This may have\r\nbeen because the sea bottom of this region rose, or because the sea\r\nbottom in other places was depressed, thus drawing off the water. The\r\ntopography of this new land, like the topography of those portions of\r\nthe sea bottom which are similarly situated, must have been for the most\r\npart level. Low swells and broad undulations may have existed, but no\r\nconsiderable prominences, and no sudden change of slope. The surface was\r\nprobably so flat that it would have been regarded as a level surface had\r\nit been seen.\r\n\r\nThe height to which the uplift carried the new land surface at the\r\noutset must ever remain a matter of conjecture. Some estimate may be\r\nmade of the amount of uplift which the region has suffered since the\r\nbeginning of this uplift, but it is unknown how much took place at this\r\ntime, and how much in later periods of geological history.\r\n\r\nThe new land surface at once became the site of new activities. All\r\nprocesses of land erosion at once attacked the new surface, in the\r\neffort to carry its materials back to the sea. The sculpturing of this\r\nplain, which, with some interruption, has continued to the present day,\r\nhas given the region the chief elements of its present topography. But\r\nbefore considering the special history of erosion in this region, it may\r\nbe well to consider briefly the general principles and processes of land\r\ndegradation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n           GENERAL OUTLINE OF RAIN AND RIVER EROSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Elements of erosion._--The general process of subaerial erosion is\r\ndivisible into the several sub-processes of weathering, transportation,\r\nand corrasion.[5]\r\n\r\n    [5] There is an admirable exposition of this subject in\r\n    Gilbert's \"Henry Mountains.\"\r\n\r\n_Weathering_ is the term applied to all those processes which\r\ndisintegrate and disrupt exposed surfaces of rock. It is accomplished\r\nchiefly by solution, changes in temperature, the wedge-work of ice and\r\nroots, the borings of animals, and such chemical changes as surface\r\nwater and air effect. The products of weathering are transported by the\r\ndirect action of gravity, by glaciers, by winds, and by running water.\r\nOf these the last is the most important.\r\n\r\n_Corrasion_ is accomplished chiefly by the mechanical wear of streams,\r\naided by the hard fragments such as sand, gravel and bowlders, which\r\nthey carry. The solution effected by the waters of a stream may also be\r\nregarded as a part of corrasion. Under ordinary circumstances solution\r\nby streams is relatively unimportant, but where the rock is relatively\r\nsoluble, and where conditions are not favorable for abrasion, solution\r\nmay be more important than mechanical wear.\r\n\r\nSo soon as sea bottom is raised to the estate of land, it is attacked by\r\nthe several processes of degradation. The processes of weathering at\r\nonce begin to loosen the material of the surface if it be solid; winds\r\nshift the finer particles about, and with the first shower\r\ntransportation by running water begins. Weathering prepares the material\r\nfor transportation and transportation leads to corrasion. Since the goal\r\nof all material transported by running water is the sea, subaerial\r\nerosion means degradation of the surface.\r\n\r\n_Erosion without valleys._--In the work of degradation the valley\r\nbecomes the site of greatest activity, and in the following pages\r\nespecial attention is given to the development of valleys and to the\r\nphases of topography to which their development leads.\r\n\r\nIf a new land surface were to come into existence, composed of materials\r\nwhich were perfectly homogeneous, with slopes of absolute uniformity in\r\nall directions, and if the rain, the winds and all other surface\r\nagencies acted uniformly over the entire area, valleys would not be\r\ndeveloped. That portion of the rainfall which was not evaporated and did\r\nnot sink beneath the surface, would flow off the land in a sheet. The\r\nwear which it would effect would be equal in all directions from the\r\ncenter. If the angle of the slope were constant from center to shore, or\r\nif it increased shoreward, the wear effected by this sheet of water\r\nwould be greatest at the shore, because here the sheet of flowing water\r\nwould be deepest and swiftest, and therefore most effective in\r\ncorrasion.\r\n\r\n_The beginning of a valley._--But land masses as we know them do not\r\nhave equal and uniform slopes to the sea in all directions, nor is the\r\nmaterial over any considerable area perfectly homogeneous. Departure\r\nfrom these conditions, even in the smallest degree, would lead to very\r\ndifferent results.\r\n\r\nThat the surface of newly emerged land masses would, as a rule, not be\r\nrough, is evident from the fact that the bottom of the sea is usually\r\nrather smooth. Much of it indeed is so nearly plane that if the water\r\nwere withdrawn, the eye would scarcely detect any departure from\r\nplaneness. The topography of a land mass newly exposed either by its own\r\nelevation or by the withdrawal of the sea, would ordinarily be similar\r\nto that which would exist in the vicinity of Necedah and east of Camp\r\nDouglas, if the few lone hills were removed, and the very shallow\r\nvalleys filled. Though such a surface would seem to be moderately\r\nuniform as to its slopes, and homogeneous as to its material, neither\r\nthe uniformity nor the homogeneity are perfect, and the rain water would\r\nnot run off in sheets, and the wear would not be equal at all points.\r\n\r\nLet it be supposed that an area of shallow sea bottom is raised above\r\nthe sea, and that the elevation proceeds until the land has an altitude\r\nof several hundred feet. So soon as it appears above the sea, the rain\r\nfalling upon it begins to modify its surface. Some of the water\r\nevaporates at once, and has little effect on the surface; some of it\r\nsinks beneath the surface and finds its way underground to the sea; and\r\nsome of it runs off over the surface and performs the work\r\ncharacteristic of streams. So far as concerns modifications of the\r\nsurface, the run-off is the most important part.\r\n\r\nThe run-off of the surface would tend to gather in the depressions of\r\nthe surface, however slight they may be. This tendency is shown on\r\nalmost every hillside during and after a considerable shower. The water\r\nconcentrated in the depressions is in excess of that flowing over other\r\nparts of the surface, and therefore flows faster. Flowing faster, it\r\nerodes the surface over which it flows more rapidly, and as a result the\r\ninitial depressions are deepened, and _washes_ or _gullies_ are started.\r\n\r\nShould the run-off not find irregularities of slope, it would, at the\r\noutset, fail of concentration; but should it find the material more\r\neasily eroded along certain lines than along others, the lines of easier\r\nwear would become the sites of greater erosion. This would lead to the\r\ndevelopment of gullies, that is, to irregularities of slope. Either\r\ninequality of slope or material may therefore determine the location of\r\na gully, and one of these conditions is indispensable.\r\n\r\nOnce started, each wash or gully becomes the cause of its own growth,\r\nfor the gully developed by the water of one shower, determines greater\r\nconcentration of water during the next. Greater concentration means\r\nfaster flow, faster flow means more rapid wear, and this means\r\ncorresponding enlargement of the depression through which the flow takes\r\nplace. The enlargement effected by successive showers affects a gully in\r\nall dimensions. The water coming in at its head carries the head back\r\ninto the land (head erosion), thus lengthening the gully; the water\r\ncoming in at its sides wears back the lateral slopes, thus widening it;\r\nand the water flowing along its bottom deepens it. Thus gullies grow to\r\nbe ravines, and farther enlargement by the same processes converts\r\nravines into valleys. A river valley therefore is often but a gully\r\ngrown big.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL. AND NAT. HIST. SURVEY. BULLETIN NO. V.,\r\nPL. XIII.\r\n\r\nFIG. 1.\r\n\r\nA very young valley.\r\n\r\nIllustration: FIG. 2.\r\n\r\nA valley in a later stage of development.\r\n\r\nIllustration: FIG. 3.\r\n\r\nYoung valleys.]\r\n\r\n_The course of a valley._--In the lengthening of a gully or valley\r\nheadward, the growth will be in the direction of greatest wear. Thus in\r\nPlate XIII, Fig. 1, if the water coming in at the head of the gully\r\neffects most wear in the direction a, the head of the gully will\r\nadvance in that direction; if there be most wear in the direction b or\r\nc, the head will advance toward one of these points. The direction of\r\ngreatest wear will be determined either by the slope of the surface, or\r\nby the nature of the surface material. The slope may lead to the\r\nconcentration of the entering waters along one line, and the surface\r\nmaterial may be less resistant in one direction than in another. If\r\nthese factors favor the same direction of head-growth, the lengthening\r\nwill be more rapid than if but one is favorable. If there be more rapid\r\ngrowth along two lines, as b and c, Plate XIII, Fig. 1, than between\r\nthem, two gullies may develop (Plate XIII, Fig. 2). The frequent and\r\ntortuous windings common to ravines and valleys are therefore to be\r\nexplained by the inequalities of slope or material which affected the\r\nsurface while the valley was developing.\r\n\r\n_Tributary valleys._--Following out this simple conception of valley\r\ngrowth, we have to inquire how a valley system (a main valley and its\r\ntributaries) is developed. The conditions which determine the location\r\nand development of gullies in a new land surface, determine the location\r\nand development of tributary gullies. In flowing over the lateral slopes\r\nof a gully or ravine, the water finds either slope or surface material\r\nfailing of uniformity. Both conditions lead to the concentration of the\r\nwater along certain lines, and concentration of flow on the slope of an\r\nerosion depression, be it valley or gully, leads to the development of\r\na tributary depression. In its growth, the tributary repeats, in all\r\nessential respects, the history of its main. It is lengthened headward\r\nby water coming in at its upper end, is widened by side wash, and\r\ndeepened by the downward cutting of the water which flows along its\r\naxis. The factors controlling its development are the same as those\r\nwhich controlled the valley to which it is tributary.\r\n\r\nThere is one peculiarity of the courses of tributaries which deserves\r\nmention. Tributaries, as a rule, join their mains with an acute angle up\r\nstream. In general, new land surfaces, such as are now under\r\nconsideration, slope toward the sea. If a tributary gully were to start\r\nback from its main at right angles, more water would come in on the side\r\naway from the shore, on account of the seaward slope of the land. This\r\nwould be true of the head of the gully as well as of other portions, and\r\nthe effect would be to turn the head more and more toward parallelism\r\nwith the main valley. Local irregularities of surface may, and\r\nfrequently do, interfere with these normal relations, so that the\r\ngeneral course of a tributary is occasionally at right angles to its\r\nmain. Still more rarely does the general course of a tributary make an\r\nacute angle with its main on the down stream side. Local irregularities\r\nof surface determine the windings of a tributary, so that their courses\r\nfor longer or shorter distances may be in violation of the general rule\r\n(c, Fig. 43); but on the whole, the valleys of a system whose\r\nhistory has not been interrupted in a region where the surface material\r\nis not notably heterogeneous, follow the course indicated above. This is\r\nshown by nearly every drainage system on the Atlantic Coastal plain\r\nwhich represents more nearly than any other portion of our continent,\r\nthe conditions here under consideration. Fig. 12 represents the drainage\r\nsystem of the Mullica river in southern New Jersey and is a type of the\r\nCoastal plain river system.\r\n\r\n_How a valley gets a stream._--Valleys may become somewhat deep and long\r\nand wide without possessing permanent streams, though from their\r\ninception they have _temporary_ streams, the water for which is\r\nfurnished by showers or melting snow. Yet sooner or later, valleys come\r\nto have permanent streams. How are they acquired? Does the valley find\r\nthe stream or the stream the valley? For the answer to these questions,\r\na brief digression will be helpful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--A typical river system of the Coastal plain\r\ntype.]\r\n\r\nIn cultivated regions, wells are of frequent occurrence. In a flat\r\nregion of uniform structure, the depth at which well water may be\r\nobtained is essentially constant at all points. If holes (wells 1 and 2,\r\nFig. 13) be excavated below this level, water seeps into them, and in a\r\nseries of wells the water stands at a nearly common level. This means\r\nthat the sub-structure is full of water up to that level. These\r\nrelations are illustrated by Fig. 13. The diagram represents a vertical\r\nsection through a flat region from the surface (s s) down below the\r\nbottom of wells. The water stands at the same level in the two cells (1\r\nand 2), and the plane through them, at the surface of the water, is the\r\n_ground water level_. If in such a surface a valley were to be cut until\r\nits bottom was below the ground water level, the water would seep into\r\nit, as it does into the wells; and if the amount were sufficient, a\r\npermanent stream would be established. This is illustrated in Fig. 13.\r\nThe line A A represents the ground water level, and the level at which\r\nthe water stands in the wells, under ordinary circumstances. The bottom\r\nof the valley is below the level of the ground water, and the water\r\nseeps into it from either side. Its tendency is to fill the valley to\r\nthe level A A. But instead of accumulating in the open valley as it does\r\nin the enclosed wells, it flows away, and the ground water level on\r\neither hand is drawn down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Diagram illustrating the relations of ground\r\nwater to streams.]\r\n\r\nThe level of the ground water fluctuates. It is depressed when the\r\nseason is dry (A' A'), and raised when precipitation is abundant (A''\r\nA''). When it is raised, the water in the wells rises, and the stream in\r\nthe valley is swollen. When it falls, the ground water surface is\r\ndepressed, and the water in the wells becomes lower. If the water\r\nsurface sinks below the bottom of the wells, the wells \"go dry;\" if\r\nbelow the bottom of the valley, the valley becomes for the time being, a\r\n\"dry run.\" When a well is below the lowest ground-water level its supply\r\nof water never fails, and when the valley is sufficiently below the same\r\nlevel, its stream does not cease to flow, even in periods of drought. On\r\naccount of the free evaporation in the open valley, the valley\r\ndepression must be somewhat below the level necessary for a well, in\r\norder that the flow may be constant.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that _intermittent_ streams, that is, streams which flow\r\nin wet seasons and fail in dry, are intermediate between streams which\r\nflow after showers only, and those which flow without interruption. In\r\nthe figure the stream would become dry if the ground water level sank to\r\nA' A'.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that a permanent stream does not normally precede its\r\nvalley, but that the valley, developed through gully-hood and\r\nravine-hood to valley-hood by means of the temporary streams supplied by\r\nthe run-off of occasional showers, _finds a stream_, just as diggers of\r\nwells find water. The case is not altered if the stream be fed by\r\nsprings, for the valley finds the spring, as truly as the well-digger\r\nfinds a \"vein\" of water.\r\n\r\n_Limits of a valley._--So soon as a valley acquires a permanent stream,\r\nits development goes on without the interruption to which it was subject\r\nwhile the stream was intermittent. The permanent stream, like the\r\ntemporary one which preceded it, tends to deepen and widen its valley,\r\nand, under certain conditions, to lengthen it as well. The means by\r\nwhich these enlargements are affected are the same as before. There are\r\nlimits, however, in length, depth, and width, beyond which a valley may\r\nnot go. No stream can cut below the level of the water into which it\r\nflows, and it can cut to that level only at its outlet. Up stream from\r\nthat point, a gentle gradient will be established over which the water\r\nwill flow without cutting. In this condition the stream is _at grade_.\r\nIts channel has reached _baselevel_, that is, the level to which the\r\nstream can wear its bed. This grade is, however, not necessarily\r\npermanent, for what was baselevel for a small stream in an early stage\r\nof its development, is not necessarily baselevel for the larger stream\r\nwhich succeeds it at a later time.\r\n\r\nWeathering, wash, and lateral corrasion of the stream continue to widen\r\nthe valley after it has reached baselevel. The bluffs of valleys are\r\nthus forced to recede, and the valley is widened at the expense of the\r\nupland. Two valleys widening on opposite sides of a divide, narrow the\r\ndivide between them, and may ultimately wear it out. When this is\r\naccomplished, the two valleys become one. The limit to which a valley\r\nmay widen on either side is therefore its neighboring valley, and since,\r\nafter two valleys have become one by the elimination of the ridge\r\nbetween them, there are still valleys on either hand, the final result\r\nof the widening of all valleys must be to reduce all the area which\r\nthey drain to baselevel. As this process goes forward, the upper flat\r\ninto which the valleys were cut is being restricted in area, while the\r\nlower flats developed by the streams in the valley bottoms are being\r\nenlarged. Thus the lower flats grow at the expense of the higher.\r\n\r\nThere are also limits in length which a valley may not exceed. The head\r\nof any valley may recede until some other valley is reached. The\r\nrecession may not stop even there, for if, on opposite sides of a\r\ndivide, erosion is unequal, as between 1A and 1B, Fig. 14, the divide\r\nwill be moved toward the side of less rapid erosion, and it will cease\r\nto recede only when erosion on the two sides becomes equal (4A and\r\n4B). In homogeneous material this will be when the slopes on the two\r\nsides are equal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Diagram showing the shifting of a divide. The\r\nslopes 1A and 1B are unequal. The steeper slope is worn more rapidly and\r\nthe divide is shifted from 1 to 4, where the two slopes become equal and\r\nthe migration of the divide ceases.]\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the lengthening of a valley headward is not\r\nnormally the work of the permanent stream, for the permanent stream\r\nbegins some distance below the head of the valley. At the head,\r\ntherefore, erosion goes on as at the beginning, even after a permanent\r\nstream is acquired.\r\n\r\nUnder certain circumstances, the valley may be lengthened at its\r\ndebouchure. If the detritus carried by it is deposited at its mouth, or\r\nif the sea bottom beyond that point rise, the land may be extended\r\nseaward, and over this extension the stream will find its way. Thus at\r\ntheir lower, as well as at their upper ends, both the stream and its\r\nvalley may be lengthened.\r\n\r\n_A cycle of erosion._--If, along the borders of a new-born land mass, a\r\nseries of valleys were developed, essentially parallel to one another,\r\nthey would constitute depressions separated by elevations, representing\r\nthe original surface not yet notably affected by erosion (see Plate XIV,\r\nFig. 1). These inter-valley areas might at first be wide or narrow, but\r\nin process of time they would necessarily become narrow, for, once, a\r\nvalley is started, all the water which enters it from either side helps\r\nto wear back its slopes, and the wearing back of the slopes means the\r\nwidening of the valleys on the one hand and the narrowing of the\r\ninter-valley ridges on the other. Not only would the water running over\r\nthe slopes of a valley wear back its walls, but many other processes\r\nconspire to the same end. The wetting and drying, the freezing and the\r\nthawing, the roots of plants and the borings of animals, all tend to\r\nloosen the material on the slopes or walls of the valleys, and gravity\r\nhelps the loosened material to descend. Once in the valley bottom, the\r\nrunning water is likely to carry it off, landing it finally in the sea.\r\nThus the growth of the valley is not the result of running water alone,\r\nthough this is the most important single factor in the process.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL. AND NAT. HIST. SURVEY. BULLETIN NO. V.,\r\nPL. XIV.\r\n\r\nFIG. 1.\r\n\r\nThe same valleys as shown in Plate XIII, Fig. 3, in a later stage of\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nIllustration: FIG. 2.\r\n\r\nSame valleys as shown in Fig. 1, in a still later stage of\r\ndevelopment.]\r\n\r\nEven if valleys developed no tributaries, they would, in the course of\r\ntime, widen to such an extent as to nearly obliterate the intervening\r\nridges. The surface, however, would not easily be reduced to perfect\r\nflatness. For a long time at least there would remain something of slope\r\nfrom the central axis of the former inter-stream ridge, toward the\r\nstreams on either hand; but if the process of erosion went on for a\r\nsufficiently long period of time, the inter-stream ridge would be\r\nbrought very low, and the result would be an essentially flat surface\r\nbetween the streams, much below the level of the old one.\r\n\r\nThe first valleys which started on the land surface (see Plate XIII,\r\nFig. 3) would be almost sure to develop numerous tributaries. Into\r\ntributary valleys water would flow from their sides and from their\r\nheads, and as a result they would widen and deepen and lengthen just as\r\ntheir mains had done before them. By lengthening headward they would\r\nwork back from their mains some part, or even all of the way across the\r\ndivides separating the main valleys. By this process, the tributaries\r\ncut the divides between the main streams into shorter cross-ridges. With\r\nthe development of tributary valleys there would be many lines of\r\ndrainage instead of two, working at the area between two main streams.\r\nThe result would be that the surface would be brought low much more\r\nrapidly, for it is clear that many valleys within the area between the\r\nmain streams, widening at the same time, would diminish the aggregate\r\narea of the upland much more rapidly than two alone could do.\r\n\r\nThe same thing is made clear in another way. It will be seen (Plate XIV,\r\nFigs. 1 and 2) that the tributaries would presently dissect an area of\r\nuniform surface, tending to cut it into a series of short ridges or\r\nhills. In this way the amount of sloping surface is greatly increased,\r\nand as a result, every shower would have much more effect in washing\r\nloose materials down to lower levels, whence the streams could carry\r\nthem to the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Cross-sections showing various stages of\r\nerosion in one cycle.]\r\n\r\nThe successive stages in the process of lowering a surface are suggested\r\nby Fig. 15, which represents a series of cross-sections of a land mass\r\nin process of degradation. The uppermost section represents a level\r\nsurface crossed by young valleys. The next lower represents the same\r\nsurface at a later stage, when the valleys have grown larger, while the\r\nthird and succeeding sections represent still later stages in the\r\nprocess of degradation. Plate XIII, Fig. 3, and Plate XIV, Figs. 1 and\r\n2, represent in another way the successive stages of stream work in the\r\ngeneral process of degradation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL. AND NAT. HIST. SURVEY. BULLETIN NO. V.,\r\nPL. XV.\r\n\r\nDiagram illustrating how a hard inclined layer of rock becomes a ridge\r\nin the process of degradation.]\r\n\r\nIn this manner a series of rivers, operating for a sufficiently long\r\nperiod of time, might reduce even a high land mass to a low level,\r\nscarcely above the sea. The new level would be developed soonest near\r\nthe sea, and the areas farthest from it would be the last--other things\r\nbeing equal--to be brought low. The time necessary for the development\r\nof such a surface is known as a _cycle of erosion_, and the resulting\r\nsurface is a _base-level plain_, that is, a plain as near sea level as\r\nriver erosion can bring it. At a stage shortly preceding the base-level\r\nstage the surface would be a _peneplain_. A peneplain, therefore, is a\r\nsurface which has been brought toward, but not to base-level. Land\r\nsurfaces are often spoken of as young or old in their erosion history\r\naccording to the stage of advancement which has been made toward\r\nbase-leveling. Thus the Colorado canyon, deep and impressive as it is,\r\nis, in terms of erosion, a young valley, for the river has done but a\r\nsmall part of the work which must be done in order to bring its basin to\r\nbaselevel.\r\n\r\n_Effects of unequal hardness._--The process of erosion thus sketched\r\nwould ultimately bring the surface of the land down to base-level, and\r\nin case the material of the land were homogeneous, the last points to be\r\nreduced would be those most remote from the axes of the streams doing\r\nthe work of leveling. But if the material of the land were of unequal\r\nhardness, those parts which were hardest would resist the action of\r\nerosion most effectively. The areas of softer rock would be brought low,\r\nand the outcrops of hard rock (Plate XV) would constitute ridges during\r\nthe later stages of an erosion cycle. If there were bodies of hard rock,\r\nsuch as the Baraboo quartzite, surrounded by sandstone, such as the\r\nPotsdam, the sandstone on either hand would be worn down much more\r\nreadily than the quartzite, and in the course of degradation the latter\r\nwould come to stand out prominently. The region in the vicinity of Devil's\r\nlake is in that stage of erosion in which the quartzite ridges are\r\nconspicuous (Plate XXXVII). The less resistant sandstone has been\r\nremoved from about them, and erosion has not advanced so far since the\r\nisolation of the quartzite ridges as to greatly lower their crests. The\r\nharder strata are at a level where surface water can still work\r\neffectively, even though slowly, upon them, and in spite of their great\r\nresistance they will ultimately be brought down to the common level. It\r\nwill be seen that, from the point of view of subaerial erosion, a\r\nbase-level plain is the only land surface which is in a condition of\r\napproximate stability.\r\n\r\n_Falls and rapids._--If in lowering its channel a stream crosses one\r\nlayer of rock much harder than the next underlying, the deepening will\r\ngo on more rapidly on the less resistant bed. Where the stream crosses\r\nfrom the harder to the less hard, the gradient is likely to become\r\nsteep, and a rapids is formed. These conditions are suggested in Fig. 16\r\nwhich represents the successive profiles (a b, a c, d e, f e, g e,\r\nand h e) of a stream crossing from a harder to a softer formation. Below\r\nthe point a the stream is flowing over rock which is easily eroded, while\r\nabove that point its course is over a harder formation. Just below a\r\n(profile a b) the gradient has become so steep that there are rapids.\r\nUnder these conditions, erosion is rapid just beyond the crossing of the\r\nhard layer, and the gradient becomes higher and higher. When the steep\r\nslope of the rapids approaches verticality, the rapids become a _fall_\r\n(profile a c).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Diagram to illustrate the development of a\r\nrapid and fall. The upper layer is harder than the strata below. The\r\nsuccessive profiles of the stream below the hard layer are represented\r\nby the lines a b, a c, d e, f e, g e, and h e.]\r\n\r\nAs the water falls over the precipitous face and strikes upon the softer\r\nrock below, part of it rebounds against the base of the vertical face\r\n(Fig. 16). The result of wear at this point is the undermining of the\r\nhard layer above, and sooner or later, portions of it will fall. This\r\nwill occasion the recession of the fall (profile d e and f e). As the\r\nfall recedes, it grows less and less high. When the recession has\r\nreached the point i, or, in other words, when the gradient of the stream\r\nbelow the fall crosses the junction of the beds of unequal hardness, as\r\nit ultimately must, effective undermining ceases, and the end of the\r\nfall is at hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL. AND NAT. HIST. SURVEY. BULLETIN NO. V.,\r\nPL. XVI.\r\n\r\nSkillett Falls, in the Potsdam formation, three miles southwest of\r\nBaraboo. The several small falls are occasioned by slight inequalities\r\nin the hardness of the layers.]\r\n\r\nWhen the effective undercutting ceases because the softer bed is no\r\nlonger accessible, the point of maximum wear is transferred to the top\r\nof the hard bed just where the water begins to fall (g, Fig. 16). The\r\nwear here is no greater than before, though it is greater relatively.\r\nThe relatively greater wear at this point destroys the verticality of\r\nthe face, converting it into a steep slope. When this happens, the fall\r\nis a thing of the past, and rapids succeed. With continued flow the bed\r\nof the rapids becomes less and less steep, until it is finally reduced\r\nto the normal gradient of the stream (h e), when the rapids disappear.\r\n\r\nWhen thin layers of rock in a stream's course vary in hardness, softer\r\nbeds alternating with harder ones, a series of falls such as shown in\r\nPlate XVI, may result. As they work up stream, these falls will be\r\nobliterated one by one. Thus it is seen that falls and rapids are not\r\npermanent features of the landscape. They belong to the younger period\r\nof a valley's history, rather than to the older. They are marks of\r\ntopographic youth.\r\n\r\n_Narrows._--Where a stream crosses a hard layer or ridge of rock lying\r\nbetween softer ones, the valley will not widen so rapidly in the hard\r\nrock as above and below. If the hard beds be vertical, so that their\r\noutcrop is not shifted as the degradation of the surface proceeds, a\r\nnotable constriction of the valley results. Such a constriction is a\r\n_narrows_. The Upper and Lower narrows of the Baraboo (Plate IV)\r\nare good examples of the effect of hard rock on the widening of a\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\n_Erosion of folded strata._--The processes of river erosion would not be\r\nessentially different in case the land mass upon which erosion operated\r\nwere made of tilted and folded strata. The folds would, at the outset,\r\ndetermine the position of the drainage lines, for the main streams would\r\nflow in the troughs (synclines) between the folds (anticlines). Once\r\ndeveloped, the streams would lower their beds, widen their valleys, and\r\nlengthen their courses, and in the long process of time they would bring\r\nthe area drained nearly to sea-level, just as in the preceding case. It\r\nwas under such conditions that the general processes of subaerial\r\nerosion operated in south central Wisconsin, after the uplift of the\r\nquartzite and before the deposition of the Potsdam sandstone. It was\r\nthen that the principal features of the topography of the quartzite were\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nIn regions of folded strata, certain beds are likely to be more\r\nresistant than others. Where harder beds alternate with softer, the\r\nformer finally come to stand out as ridges, while the outcrops of the\r\nlatter mark the sites of the valleys. Such alternations of beds of\r\nunequal resistance give rise to various peculiarities of drainage,\r\nparticularly in the courses of tributaries. These peculiarities find no\r\nillustration in this region and are not here discussed.\r\n\r\n_Base-level plains and peneplains._--It is important to notice that a\r\nplane surface (base-level) developed by streams could only be developed\r\nat elevations but slightly above the sea, that is, at levels at which\r\nrunning water ceases to be an effective agent of erosion; for so long as\r\na stream is actively deepening its valley, its tendency is to roughen\r\nthe area which it drains, not to make it smooth. The Colorado river,\r\nflowing through high land, makes a deep gorge. All the streams of the\r\nwestern plateaus have deep valleys, and the manifest result of their\r\naction is to roughen the surface; but given time enough, and the streams\r\nwill have cut their beds to low gradients. Then, though deepening of the\r\nvalleys will cease, widening will not, and inch by inch and shower by\r\nshower the elevated lands between the valleys will be reduced in area,\r\nand ultimately the whole will be brought down nearly to the level of the\r\nstream beds. This is illustrated by Fig. 15.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL. AND NAT. HIST. SURVEY. BULLETIN NO. V.,\r\nPL. XVII.\r\n\r\nA group of mounds on the plain southwest from Camp Douglas. The\r\nbase-level surface is well shown, and above it rise the remnants of the\r\nhigher plain from which the lower was reduced.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL. AND NAT. HIST. SURVEY. BULLETIN NO. V.,\r\nPL. XVIII.\r\n\r\nCastle Rock near Camp Douglas. In this view the relation of the erosion\r\nremnant to the extensive base-leveled surface is well shown.]\r\n\r\nIt is important to notice further that if the original surface on which\r\nerosion began is level, there is no stage intermediate between the\r\nbeginning and the end of an erosion cycle, when the surface is again\r\nlevel, or nearly so, though in the stage of a cycle next preceding the\r\nlast--the peneplain stage (fourth profile, Fig. 15)--the surface\r\napproaches flatness. It is also important to notice that when streams\r\nhave cut a land surface down to the level at which they cease to erode,\r\nthat surface will still possess some slight slope, and that to seaward.\r\n\r\nNo definite degree of slope can be fixed upon as marking a base-level.\r\nThe angle of slope which would practically stop erosion in a region of\r\nslight rainfall would be great enough to allow of erosion if the\r\nprecipitation were greater. All that can be said, therefore, is that the\r\nangle of slope must be low. The Mississippi has a fall of less than a\r\nfoot per mile for some hundreds of miles above the gulf. A small stream\r\nin a similar situation would have ceased to lower its channel before so\r\nlow a gradient was reached.\r\n\r\nThe nearest approach to a base-leveled region within the area here under\r\nconsideration is in the vicinity of Camp Douglas and Necedah (see Plate\r\nI). This is indeed one of the best examples of a base-leveled plain\r\nknown. Here the broad plain, extending in some directions as far as the\r\neye can reach, is as low as it could be reduced by the streams which\r\ndeveloped it. The erosion cycle which produced the plain was, however,\r\nnot completed, for above the plain rise a few conspicuous hills (Plates\r\nXVII and XVIII, and Fig. 17), and to the west of it lie the highlands\r\nmarking the level from which the low plain was reduced.\r\n\r\nWhere a region has been clearly base-leveled, isolated masses or ridges\r\nof resistant rock may still stand out conspicuously above it. The\r\nquartzite hill at Necedah is an example. Such hills are known as\r\n_monadnocks_. This name was taken from Mount Monadnock which owes its\r\norigin to the removal of the surrounding less resistant beds. The name\r\nhas now become generic. Many of the isolated hills on the peneplain east\r\nof Camp Douglas are perhaps due to superior resistance, though the rock\r\nof which they are composed belongs to the same formation as that which\r\nhas been removed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--Sketch, looking northwest from Camp Douglas.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHARACTERISTICS OF VALLEYS AT VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT.\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of its development a depression made by erosion has\r\nsteep lateral slopes, the exact character of which is determined by many\r\nconsiderations. Its normal cross-section is usually described as\r\nV-shaped (Fig. 18). In the early stages of its development, especially\r\nif in unconsolidated material, the slopes are normally convex inward. If\r\ncut in solid rock, the cross section may be the same, though many\r\nvariations are likely to appear, due especially to the structure of the\r\nrock and to inequalities of hardness. If a stream be swift enough to\r\ncarry off not only all the detritus descending from its slopes, but to\r\nabrade its bed effectively besides, a steep-sided gorge develops. If it\r\nbecomes deep, it is a canyon. For the development of a canyon, the\r\nmaterial of the walls must be such as is capable of standing at a high\r\nangle. A canyon always indicates that the down-cutting of a stream keeps\r\nwell ahead of the widening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Diagrammatic cross-section of a young valley.]\r\n\r\nOf young valleys in loose material (drift) there are many examples in\r\nthe eastern portion of the area here described. Shallow canyons or\r\ngorges in rock are also found. The gorge of Skillett creek at and above\r\nthe Pewit's nest about three miles southwest from Baraboo, the gorge of\r\nDell creek two miles south of Kilbourn City, and the Dalles of the\r\nWisconsin at Kilbourn City may serve as illustrations of this type of\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--Diagrammatic profile of a young valley.]\r\n\r\nThe profile of a valley at the stage of its development corresponding to\r\nthe above section is represented diagrammatically by the curve A B in\r\nFig. 19. The sketch (Pl. XIX, Fig. 1) represents a bird's-eye view of a\r\nvalley in the same stage of development.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--Diagrammatic cross-section of a valley at a\r\nstage corresponding with that shown in Plate XIX, Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nAt a stage of development later than that represented by the V-shaped\r\ncross-section, the corresponding section is U-shaped, as shown in Fig.\r\n20. The same form is sketched in Plate XIX, Fig. 2. This represents a\r\nstage of development where detritus descending the slopes is not all\r\ncarried away by the stream, and where the valley is being widened faster\r\nthan it is deepened. Its slopes are therefore becoming gentler. The\r\nprofile of the valley at this stage would be much the same as that in\r\nthe preceding, except that the gradient in the lower portion would be\r\nlower.\r\n\r\nStill later the cross section of the valley assumes the shape shown in\r\nFig. 21, and in perspective the form sketched in Plate XX, Fig. 1. This\r\ntransformation is effected partly by erosion, and partly by deposition\r\nin the valley. When a stream has cut its valley as low as conditions\r\nallow, it becomes sluggish. A sluggish stream is easily turned from side\r\nto side, and, directed against its banks, it may undercut them, causing\r\nthem to recede at the point of undercutting. In its meanderings, it\r\nundercuts at various points at various times, and the aggregate result\r\nis the widening of the valley. By this process alone the stream would\r\ndevelop a flat grade. At the same time all the drainage which comes in\r\nat the sides tends to carry the walls of the valley farther from its\r\naxis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--Diagrammatic cross-section of a valley at a\r\nstage later than that shown in Fig. 20.]\r\n\r\nA sluggish stream is also generally a depositing stream. Its deposits\r\ntend to aggrade (build up) the flat which its meanderings develop. When\r\na valley bottom is built up, it becomes wider at the same time, for the\r\nvalley is, as a rule, wider at any given level than at any lower one.\r\nThus the U-shaped valley is finally converted into a valley with a flat\r\nbottom, the flat being due in large part to erosion, and in smaller part\r\nto deposition. Under exceptional circumstances the relative importance\r\nof these two factors may be reversed.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the cross-section of a valley affords a clue to its\r\nage. A valley without a flat is young, and increasing age is indicated\r\nby increasing width. Valleys illustrating all stages of development are\r\nto be found in the Devil's lake region. The valley of Honey creek\r\nsouthwest of Devil's lake may be taken as an illustration of a valley at\r\nan intermediate stage of development, while examples of old valleys are\r\nfound in the flat country about Camp Douglas and Necedah.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL.

Dissolved mineral\r\nmatter (which is not sediment) is also carried in the water. By means of\r\nthat rolled along the bottom and carried in suspension, especially the\r\nformer, the stream as already stated abrades its bed.\r\n\r\nThe transporting power of a stream of given size varies with its\r\nvelocity. Increase in the declivity or the volume of a stream increases\r\nits velocity and therefore its transportive power. The transportation\r\neffected by a stream is influenced (1) by its transporting power, and (2)\r\nby the size and amount of material available for carriage. Fine material\r\nis carried with a less expenditure of energy than an equal amount of\r\ncoarse. With the same expenditure of energy therefore a stream can carry\r\na greater amount of the former than of the latter.\r\n\r\nSince the transportation effected by a stream is dependent on its\r\ngradient, its size, and the size and amount of material available, it\r\nfollows that when these conditions change so as to decrease the carrying\r\npower of the river, deposition will follow, if the stream was previously\r\nfully loaded. In other words, a stream will deposit when it becomes\r\noverloaded.\r\n\r\nOverloading may come about in the following ways: (1) By decrease in\r\ngradient, checking velocity and therefore carrying power; (2) by\r\ndecrease in amount of water, which may result from evaporation,\r\nabsorption, etc.; (3) by change in the shape of the channel, so that the\r\nfriction of flow is increased, and therefore the force available for\r\ntransportation lessened; (4) by lateral drainage bringing in more\r\nsediment than the main stream can carry; (5) by change in the character\r\nof the material to which the stream has access; for if it becomes finer,\r\nthe coarse material previously carried will be dropped, and the fine\r\ntaken; and (6) by the checking of velocity when a stream flows into a\r\nbody of standing water.\r\n\r\n_Topographic forms resulting from stream deposition._--The topographic\r\nforms resulting from stream deposition are various. At the bottoms of\r\nsteep slopes, temporary streams build _alluvial cones_ or _fans_. Along\r\nits flood-plain portion, a stream deposits more or less sediment on its\r\nflats. The part played by deposition in building a river flat has\r\nalready been alluded to. A depositing stream often wanders about in an\r\napparently aimless way across its flood plain. At the bends in its\r\ncourse, cutting is often taking place on the outside of a curve while\r\ndeposition is going on in the inside. The valley of the Baraboo\r\nillustrates this process of cutting and building. Fig. 2, Plate XX, is\r\nbased upon the features of the valley within the city of Baraboo.\r\n\r\nBesides depositing on its flood-plain, a stream often deposits in its\r\nchannel. Any obstruction of a channel which checks the current of a\r\nloaded stream occasions deposition. In this way \"bars\" are formed. Once\r\nstarted, the bar increases in size, for it becomes an obstacle to flow,\r\nand so the cause of its own growth. It may be built up nearly to the\r\nsurface of the stream, and in low water, it may become an island by the\r\ndepression of the surface water. In some parts of its course, as about\r\nMerrimac, the Wisconsin river is marked by such islands at low water,\r\nand by a much larger number of bars.\r\n\r\nAt their debouchures, streams give up their loads of sediment. Under\r\nfavorable conditions deltas are built, but delta-building has not\r\nentered into the physical history of this region to any notable extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Rejuvenation of Streams._\r\n\r\nAfter the development of a base-level plain, its surface would suffer\r\nlittle change (except that effected by underground water) so long as it\r\nmaintained its position. But if, after its development, a base-level\r\nplain were elevated, the old surface in a new position would be subject\r\nto a new series of changes identical in kind with those which had gone\r\nbefore. The elevation would give the established streams greater fall,\r\nand they would reassume the characteristics of youth. The greater fall\r\nwould accelerate their velocities; the increased velocities would entail\r\nincreased erosion; increased erosion would result in the deepening of\r\nthe valleys, and the deepening of the valleys would lead to the\r\nroughening of the surface. But in the course of time, the _rejuvenated_\r\nstreams would have cut their valleys as low as the new altitude of the\r\nland permitted, that is, to a new base-level. The process of deepening\r\nwould then stop, and the limit of vertical relief which the streams were\r\ncapable of developing, would be attained. But the valleys would not stop\r\nwidening when they stopped deepening, and as they widened, the\r\nintervening divides would become narrower, and ultimately lower. In the\r\ncourse of time they would be destroyed, giving rise to a new level\r\nsurface much below the old one, but developed in the same position which\r\nthe old one occupied when it originated; that is, a position but little\r\nabove sea level.\r\n\r\nIf at some intermediate stage in the development of a second base-level\r\nplain, say at a time when the streams, rejuvenated by uplift, had\r\nbrought half the elevated surface down to a new base-level, another\r\nuplift were to occur, the half completed cycle would be brought to an\r\nend, and a new one begun. The streams would again be quickened, and as a\r\nresult they would promptly cut new and deeper channels in the bottoms of\r\nthe great valleys which had already been developed. The topography which\r\nwould result is suggested by the following diagram (Fig. 22) which\r\nillustrates the cross-section which would be found after the following\r\nsequence of events: (1) The development of a base-level, A A; (2)\r\nuplift, rejuvenation of the streams, and a new cycle of erosion half\r\ncompleted, the new base-level being at B B; (3) a second uplift,\r\nbringing the second (incomplete) cycle of erosion to a close, and by\r\nrejuvenating the streams, inaugurating the third cycle. As represented\r\nin the diagram, the third cycle has not progressed far, being\r\nrepresented only by the narrow valley C. The base-level is now 2-2, and\r\nthe valley represented in the diagram has not yet reached it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Diagram (cross-section), illustrating the\r\ntopographic effect of rejuvenation by uplift.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Normal profile of a valley bottom in a\r\nnon-mountainous region.]\r\n\r\nThe rejuvenation of a stream shows itself in another way. The normal\r\nprofile of a valley bottom in a non-mountainous region is a gentle\r\ncurve, concave upward with gradient increasing from debouchure to\r\nsource. Such a profile is shown in Fig. 23. Fig. 24, on the other hand,\r\nis the profile of a rejuvenated stream. The valley once had a profile\r\nsimilar to that shown in Fig. 23. Below B its former continuation is\r\nmarked by the dotted line B C. Since rejuvenation the stream has\r\ndeepened the lower part of its valley, and established there a profile\r\nin harmony with the new conditions. The upper end of the new curve has\r\nnot yet reached beyond B.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.--Profile of a stream rejuvenated by uplift.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Underground Water._\r\n\r\nIn what has preceded, reference has been made only to the results\r\naccomplished by the water which runs off over the surface. The water\r\nwhich sinks beneath it is, however, of no small importance in reducing a\r\nland surface. The enormous amount of mineral matter in solution in\r\nspring water bears witness to the efficiency of the ground water in\r\ndissolving rock, for since the water did not contain the mineral matter\r\nwhen it entered the soil, it must have acquired it below the surface. By\r\nthis means alone, areas of more soluble rock are lowered below those of\r\nless solubility. Furthermore, the water is still active as a solvent\r\nagent after a surface has been reduced to so low a gradient that the\r\nrun-off ceases to erode mechanically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n        EROSION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF STRIKING SCENIC FEATURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe uplift following the period of Paleozoic deposition in south central\r\nWisconsin, inaugurated a period of erosion which, with some\r\ninterruptions, has continued to the present day. The processes of\r\nweathering began as soon as the surface was exposed to the weather, and\r\ncorrasion by running water began with the first shower which fell upon\r\nit. The sediment worn from the land was carried back to the sea, there\r\nto be used in the building of still younger formations.\r\n\r\nThe rate of erosion of a land surface depends in large measure upon its\r\nheight. As a rule, it is eroded rapidly if high, and but slowly if low.\r\n\r\nIt is not known whether the lands of central Wisconsin rose to slight or\r\nto great heights at the close of the period of Paleozoic sedimentation.\r\nIt is therefore not known whether the erosion was at the outset rapid or\r\nslow. If the land of southern Wisconsin remained low for a time after\r\nthe uplift which brought the Paleozoic sedimentation to a close,\r\nweathering would have exceeded transportation and corrasion. A large\r\nproportion of the rainfall would have sunk beneath the surface, and\r\nfound its way to the sea by subterranean routes. Loosening of material\r\nby alternate wetting and drying, expansion and contraction, freezing and\r\nthawing, and by solution, might have gone on steadily, but so long as\r\nthe land was low, there would have been little run-off, and that little\r\nwould have flowed over a surface of gentle slopes, and transportation\r\nwould have been at a minimum. On the whole, the degradation of the land\r\nunder these conditions could not have advanced rapidly.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the land was raised promptly to a considerable\r\nheight, erosion would have been vigorous at the outset. The surface\r\nwaters would soon have developed valleys which the streams would have\r\nwidened, deepened and lengthened. Both transportation and corrasion\r\nwould have been active, and whatever material was prepared for\r\ntransportation by weathering, and brought into the valleys by side-wash,\r\nwould have been hurried on its way to the sea, and degradation would\r\nhave proceeded rapidly.\r\n\r\n_Establishment of drainage._--Valleys were developed in this new land\r\nsurface according to the principles already set forth. Between the\r\nvalleys there were divides, which became higher as the valleys became\r\ndeeper, and narrower as the valleys widened. Ultimately the ridges were\r\nlowered, and many of them finally eliminated in the manner already\r\noutlined. The distance below the original surface and that at which the\r\nfirst series of new flats were developed is conjectural, but it would\r\nhave depended on the height of the land. So far as can now be inferred,\r\nthe new base-plain toward which the streams cut may have been 400 or 500\r\nfeet below the crests of the quartzite ridges. It was at this level that\r\nthe oldest base-plain of which this immediate region shows evidence, was\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nHad the quartzite ranges not been completely buried by the Paleozoic\r\nsediments, they would have appeared as ridges on the new land surface,\r\nand would have had a marked influence on the development of the drainage\r\nof the newly emerged surface. But as the ranges were probably completely\r\nburied, the drainage lines were established regardless of the position\r\nof the hard, but buried ridges. When in the process of degradation the\r\nquartzite surfaces were reached, the streams encountered a formation far\r\nmore resistant than the surrounding sandstone and limestone. As the less\r\nresistant strata were worn away, the old quartzite ridges, long buried,\r\nagain became prominent topographic features. In this condition they were\r\n\"resurrected mountains.\"\r\n\r\nIf, when erosion on the uplifted surface of Paleozoic rocks began, a\r\nvalley had been located directly over the buried quartzite ridge, and\r\nalong its course, it would have been deepened normally until its bottom\r\nreached the crest of the hard formation. Then, instead of sinking its\r\nvalley vertically downward into the quartzite, the stream would have\r\nshifted its channel down the slope of the range along the junction of\r\nthe softer and harder rock (Fig. 25). Such changes occasioned by the\r\nnature and position of the rock concerned, are known as _adjustments_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.--Diagram illustrating the hypothetical case of a\r\nstream working down the slope of the quartzite range. The successive\r\nsections of the valley are suggested by the lines ae, be, ce and de.]\r\n\r\nStreams which crossed the quartzite ridges on the overlying strata might\r\nhave held their courses even after their valleys were lowered to the\r\nlevel of the quartzite. Such streams would have developed narrows at the\r\ncrossing of the quartzite. In so far as there were passes in the\r\nquartzite range before the deposition of the Paleozoic beds, they were\r\nfilled during the long period of sedimentation, to be again cleared out\r\nduring the subsequent period of erosion. The gap in the South range now\r\noccupied by the lake was a narrows in a valley which existed, though\r\nperhaps not to its present depth, before the Potsdam sandstone was\r\ndeposited. It was filled when the sediments of that formation were laid\r\ndown, to be again opened, and perhaps deepened, in the period of erosion\r\nwhich followed the deposition of the Paleozoic series.\r\n\r\nDuring the earliest period of erosion of which there is positive\r\nevidence, after the uplift of the Paleozoic beds, the softer formations\r\nabout the quartzite were worn down to a level 400 or 500 feet below the\r\ncrests of the South quartzite range. At this lower level, an approximate\r\nplain, a peneplain, was developed, the level of which is shown by\r\nnumerous hills, the summits of which now reach an elevation of from\r\n1,000 to 1,100 feet above the sea. At the time of its development, this\r\npeneplain was but little above sea level, for this is the only elevation\r\nat which running water can develop such a plain. Above the general level\r\nof this plain rose the quartzite ranges as elongate monadnocks, the\r\nhighest parts of which were fully 500 feet above the plain. A few other\r\npoints in the vicinity failed to be reduced to the level of the\r\npeneplain. The 1,320 foot hill (d, Plate XXXVII), one and one-half miles\r\nsoutheast of the Lower narrows, and Gibraltar Rock (e, same Plate), two\r\nmiles southeast of Merrimac, rose as prominences above it. It is\r\npossible that these crests are remnants of a base-level plain older than\r\nthat referred to above. If while the quartzite remained much as now, the\r\nvalleys in the sandstone below 1,000 or 1,100 feet were filled, the\r\nresult would correspond in a general way to the surface which existed in\r\nthis region when the first distinctly recognizable cycle of erosion was\r\nbrought to a close. Above the undulating plain developed in the\r\nsandstone and limestone, the main quartzite ridge would have risen as a\r\nconspicuous ridge 400 to 500 feet.\r\n\r\nThis cycle had not been completed, that is, the work of base-leveling\r\nhad not been altogether accomplished, when the peneplain was elevated,\r\nand the cycle, though still incomplete, brought to a close. By the\r\nuplift, the streams were rejuvenated, and sunk their valleys into the\r\nelevated peneplain. Thus a new cycle of erosion was begun, and the\r\nuplifted peneplain was dissected by the quickened streams which sank\r\ntheir valleys promptly into the slightly resistant sandstone. At their\r\nnew base-level, they ultimately developed new flats. This cycle of\r\nerosion appears to have advanced no farther than to the development of\r\nwide flats along the principal streams, such as the Wisconsin and the\r\nBaraboo, and narrow ones along the subordinate water courses, when it\r\nwas interrupted. Along the main streams the new flats were at a level\r\nwhich is now from 800 to 900 feet above the sea, and 700 to 800 feet\r\nbelow the South quartzite range. It was at this time that the plains\r\nabout Camp Douglas and Necedah, already referred to, were developed.\r\nDuring this second incomplete cycle, the quartzite ranges, resisting\r\nerosion, came to stand up still more prominently than during the first.\r\n\r\nThe interruption of this cycle was caused by the advent of the glacial\r\nperiod which disturbed the normal course of erosion. This period was\r\naccompanied and followed by slight changes of level which also had their\r\ninfluence on the streams. The consideration of the effects of glaciation\r\nand of subsequent river erosion are postponed, but it may be stated that\r\nwithin the area which was glaciated the post-glacial streams have been\r\nlargely occupied in removing the drift deposited by the ice from the\r\npreglacial valleys, or in cutting new valleys in the drift. The streams\r\noutside the area of glaciation were less seriously disturbed.\r\n\r\nAt levels other than those indicated, partial base-levels are suggested,\r\nand although less well marked in this region, they might, in the study\r\nof a broader area, bring out a much more complicated erosion history. As\r\nalready suggested, one cycle may have preceded that the remnants of\r\nwhich now stand 1,000-1,100 feet above sea level, and another may have\r\nintervened between this and that marked by the 800 to 900 foot level.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it is clear that the topography of the region is, on\r\nthe whole, an erosion topography, save for certain details in its\r\neastern portion. The valleys differ in form and in size, with their age,\r\nand with the nature of the material in which they are cut; while the\r\nhills and ridges differ with varying relations to the streams, and with\r\nthe nature of the material of which they are composed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Striking Scenic Features._\r\n\r\nIn a region so devoid of striking scenery as the central portion of the\r\nMississippi basin, topographic features which would be passed without\r\nspecial notice in regions of greater relief, become the objects of\r\ninterest. But in south central Wisconsin there are various features\r\nwhich would attract attention in any region where the scenery is not\r\nmountainous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL. AND NAT. HIST. SURVEY. BULLETIN NO. V.,\r\nPL. XXI.\r\n\r\nCleopatra's Needle. West Bluff of Devil's Lake.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL. AND NAT. HIST. SURVEY. BULLETIN NO. V.,\r\nPL. XXII.\r\n\r\nTurk's Head. West Bluff of Devil's Lake.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL. AND NAT. HIST. SURVEY. BULLETIN NO. V.,\r\nPL. XXIII.\r\n\r\nDevil's Doorway. East of Devil's Lake.]\r\n\r\nOn the bluffs at Devil's lake there are many minor features which are\r\nsure to attract the attention of visitors. Such are \"Cleopatra's Needle\"\r\n(Plate XXI), \"Turk's Head\" (Plate XXII), and the \"Devil's Doorway\"\r\n(Plate XXIII).\r\n\r\nThese particular forms have resulted from the peculiar weathering of the\r\nquartzite. The rock is affected by several systems of vertical or nearly\r\nvertical joint planes (cracks), which divide the whole formation into a\r\nseries of vertical columns. There are also horizontal and oblique planes\r\nof cleavage dividing the columns, so that the great quartzite pile may\r\nbe said to be made up of a series of blocks, which are generally in\r\ncontact with one another. The isolated pillars and columns which have\r\nreceived special names have been left as they now stand by the falling\r\naway of the blocks which once surrounded them. They themselves must soon\r\nfollow. The great talus slopes at the base of the bluffs, such as those\r\non the west side of the lake and on the East bluff near its southeast\r\ncorner, Plate XXIV, are silent witnesses of the extent to which this\r\nprocess has already gone. The blocks of rock of which they are composed\r\nhave been loosened by freezing water, by the roots of trees, and by\r\nexpansion and contraction due to changing temperature, and have fallen\r\nfrom their former positions to those they now occupy. Their descent,\r\neffected by gravity directly, is, it will be noted, the first step in\r\ntheir journey to the sea, the final resting place of all products of\r\nland degradation.\r\n\r\n_The Baraboo bluffs._--Nowhere in southern Wisconsin, or indeed in a\r\nlarge area adjacent to it, are there elevations which so nearly approach\r\nmountains as the ranges of quartzite in the vicinity of Baraboo and\r\nDevil's lake. So much has already been said of their history that there\r\nis need for little further description. Plate IV gives some idea of the\r\nappearance of the ranges. The history of the ranges, already outlined,\r\ninvolves the following stages: (1) The deposition of the sands in\r\nHuronian time; (2) the change of the sand to sandstone and the sandstone\r\nto quartzite; (3) the uplift and deformation of the beds; (4) igneous\r\nintrusions, faulting, crushing, and shoaring, with the development of\r\nschists accompanying the deformation; (5) a prolonged period of erosion\r\nduring which the folds of quartzite were largely worn away, though\r\nconsiderable ridges, the Huronian mountains of early Cambrian times,\r\nstill remained high above their surroundings; (6) the submergence of the\r\nregion, finally involving even the crests of the ridges of quartzite;\r\n(7) a protracted period of deposition during which the Potsdam sandstone\r\nand several later Paleozoic formations were laid down about, and finally\r\nover, the quartzite, burying the mountainous ridges; (8) the elevation\r\nof the Paleozoic sea-bottom, converting it into land; (9) a long period\r\nof erosion, during which the upper Paleozoic beds were removed, and the\r\nquartzite re-discovered. Being much harder than the Paleozoic rocks, the\r\nquartzite ridges again came to stand out as prominent ridges, as the\r\nsurrounding beds of relatively slight resistance were worn away. They\r\nare \"resurrected\" mountains, though not with the full height which they\r\nhad in pre-Cambrian time, for they are still partially buried by younger\r\nbeds.\r\n\r\n_The narrows in the quartzite._--There are four narrows or passes in the\r\nquartzite ridges, all of which are rather striking features. One of them\r\nis in the South range, one in the North range near its eastern end,\r\nwhile the others are in an isolated area of quartzite at Ablemans which\r\nis really a continuation of the North range. Two of these narrows are\r\noccupied by the Baraboo river, one by Narrows creek, and the fourth by\r\nDevil's lake.\r\n\r\nFrom Ablemans to a point several miles east of Baraboo, the Baraboo\r\nriver flows through a capacious valley. Where it crosses the North\r\nrange, six miles or more north of east of Baraboo, the broad valley is\r\nabruptly constricted to a narrow pass with precipitous sides, about 500\r\nfeet high (c, Plate XXXVII). This constriction is the Lower narrows,\r\nconspicuous from many points on the South range, and from the plains to\r\nthe north. Beyond the quartzite, the valley again opens out into a broad\r\nflat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL. AND NAT. HIST. SURVEY. BULLETIN NO. V.,\r\nPL. XXIV.\r\n\r\nTalus slope on the east bluff of Devil's lake.]\r\n\r\nSeen from a distance, the narrows has the appearance of an abrupt notch\r\nin the high ridge (Plate IV). Seen at closer range, the gap is\r\nstill more impressive. It is in striking contrast with the other narrows\r\nin that there are no talus accumulations at the bases of the steep\r\nslopes, and in that the slopes are relatively smooth and altogether free\r\nfrom the curious details of sculpture seen in the other gaps where the\r\nslopes are equally steep.\r\n\r\nThe Upper narrows of the Baraboo at Ablemans (b, Plate II) is in some\r\nways similar to the Lower, though less conspicuous because less deep.\r\nIts slopes are more rugged, and piles of talus lie at their bases as at\r\nDevil's lake. This narrows also differs from the Lower in that the\r\nquartzite on one side is covered with Potsdam conglomerate, which\r\noverlies the truncated edges of the vertical layers of quartzite with\r\nunconformable contact. So clear an example of unconformity is not often\r\nseen. Potsdam sandstone is also seen to rest against the quartzite on\r\neither side of the narrows (Fig. 26), thus emphasizing the unconformity.\r\nThe beauty and interest of this narrows is enhanced by the quartzite\r\nbreccia ( which appears on its walls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.--A generalized diagrammatic cross-section at the\r\nUpper narrows, to show the relation of the sandstone to the quartzite.]\r\n\r\nOne and one-half miles west of Ablemans (a, Plate II) is the third\r\npass in the north quartzite ridge. This pass is narrower than the\r\nothers, and is occupied by Narrows creek. Its walls are nearly vertical\r\nand possess the same rugged beauty as those at Ablemans. As at the Upper\r\nnarrows, the beds of quartzite here are essentially vertical. They are\r\nindeed the continuation of the beds exposed at that place.\r\n\r\nThe fourth narrows is across the South range (i, Plate II). It is not\r\nnow occupied by a stream, though like the others it was cut by a stream,\r\nwhich was afterwards shut out from it. Because of its depth, 600 feet,\r\nand the ruggedness of its slopes, and because of its occupancy by the\r\nlake, this pass is the center of interest for the whole region. So much\r\nhas already been said concerning it in other portions of this report\r\nthat further description is here omitted. The manner in which the pass\r\nwas robbed of its stream will be discussed later.\r\n\r\nThe history of these several narrows, up to the time of the glacial\r\nperiod may now be summarized. Since remnants of Potsdam sandstone are\r\nfound in some of them, it is clear that they existed in pre-Cambrian\r\ntime,[6] and there is no reason to doubt that they are the work of the\r\nstreams of those ancient days, working as streams now work. Following\r\nthe pre-Cambrian period of erosion during which the notches were cut,\r\ncame the submergence of the region, and the gaps were filled with sand\r\nand gravel, and finally the ridges themselves were buried. Uplift and a\r\nsecond period of erosion followed, during which the quartzite ranges\r\nwere again exposed by the removal of the beds which overlay them, and\r\nthe narrows cleaned out and deepened, and again occupied by streams.\r\nThis condition of things lasted up to the time when the ice invaded the\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n    [6] It is not here asserted that these notches were as deep\r\n    as now, in pre-Cambrian time. It is, however, certain that\r\n    the quartzite was deeply eroded, previous to the deposition\r\n    of the Potsdam sandstone.\r\n\r\n_Glens._--No enumeration of the special scenic features of this region\r\nwould be complete without mention of Parfrey's and Dorward's glens (a\r\nand b, Plate XXXVII, and Plate XXV). Attention has already been\r\ndirected to them as illustrations of young valleys, and as places where\r\nthe Potsdam conglomerate is well shown, but they are attractive from the\r\nscenic point of view. Their frequent mention in earlier parts of this\r\nreport makes further reference to them at this point unnecessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL. AND NAT. HIST. SURVEY. BULLETIN NO.

Dalles of the Wisconsin.]\r\n\r\nPine Hollow (k, Plate II) is another attractive gorge on the south flank\r\nof the greater quartzite range. The rock at this point is especially\r\nwell exposed. This gorge is beyond the drift-covered portion of the\r\nrange, and therefore dates from the pre-glacial time.\r\n\r\nThe Pewit's nest, about three miles southwest of Baraboo (m, Plate II),\r\nis another point of interest. Above the \"nest,\" Skillett creek flows\r\nthrough a narrow and picturesque gorge in the Potsdam sandstone. The\r\norigin of this gorge is explained elsewhere.\r\n\r\n_Natural Bridge._--About two miles north and a little west of the\r\nvillage of Denzer (Sec. 17, T. 10 N., R. 5 E.), is a small natural\r\nbridge, which has resulted from the unequal weathering of the sandstone\r\n(see Plate XXVI). The \"bridge\" is curious, rather than beautiful or\r\nimpressive.\r\n\r\n_The Dalles of the Wisconsin._--The _dalles_ is the term applied to a\r\nnarrow canyon-like stretch of the Wisconsin valley seven miles in\r\nlength, near Kilbourn City (see frontispiece). The depth of the gorge is\r\nfrom 50 to 100 feet. The part above the bridge at Kilbourn City is the\r\n\"Upper dalles;\" that below, the \"Lower dalles.\" Within this stretch of\r\nthe valley are perhaps the most picturesque features of the region.\r\n\r\nThe sides of the gorge are nearly vertical much of the way, and at many\r\npoints are so steep on both sides that landing would be impossible.\r\nBetween these sandstone walls flows the deep and swift Wisconsin river.\r\n\r\nSuch a rock gorge is in itself a thing of beauty, but in the dalles\r\nthere are many minor features which enhance the charm of the whole.\r\n\r\nOne of the features which deserves especial mention is the peculiar\r\ncrenate form of the walls at the banks of the river. This is perhaps\r\nbest seen in that part of the dalles known as the \"Navy Yard.\" Plate\r\nXXVII. The sandstone is affected by a series of vertical cracks or\r\njoints. From weathering, the rock along these joints becomes softened,\r\nand the running water wears the softened rock at the joint planes more\r\nreadily than other parts of its bank, and so develops a reentrant at\r\nthese points. Rain water descending to the river finds and follows the\r\njoint planes, and thus widens the cracks. As a result of stream and rain\r\nand weathering, deep reentrant angles are produced. The projections\r\nbetween are rounded off so that the banks of the stream have assumed the\r\ncrenate form shown in Plate XXVIII, and Frontispiece.\r\n\r\nWhen this process of weathering at the joints is carried sufficiently\r\nfar, columns of rock become isolated, and stand out on the river bluffs\r\nas \"chimneys\" (Plate XXVIII). At a still later stage of development,\r\ndecay of the rock along the joint planes may leave a large mass of rock\r\ncompletely isolated. \"Steamboat rock\" (Plate XII) and \"Sugar\r\nbowl\" (Plate XXIX) are examples of islands thus formed.\r\n\r\nThe walls of sandstone weather in a peculiar manner at some points in\r\nthe Lower dalles, as shown on Plate XXX. The little ridges stand out\r\nbecause they are harder and resist weathering better than the other\r\nparts. This is due in part at least to the presence of iron in the more\r\nresistant portions, cementing them more firmly. In the process of\r\nsegregation, cementing materials are often distributed unequally.\r\n\r\nThe effect of differences in hardness on erosion is also shown on a\r\nlarger scale and in other ways. Perhaps the most striking illustration\r\nis _Stand rock_ (Plate XXXI), but most of the innumerable and\r\npicturesque irregularities on the rock walls are to be accounted for by\r\nsuch differences.\r\n\r\nMinor valleys tributary to the Wisconsin, such as _Witch's gulch_ and\r\n_Cold Water canyon_ deserve mention, both because of their beauty, and\r\nbecause they illustrate a type of erosion at an early stage of valley\r\ndevelopment. In character they are comparable to the larger gorge to\r\nwhich they are tributary. In the downward cutting, which far exceeds the\r\nside wear in these tributary canyons, the water has excavated large bowl\r\nor jug-like forms. In Witch's gulch such forms are now being excavated.\r\nThey are developed just below falls, where the water carrying debris,\r\neddies, and the jugs or pot-holes are the result of the wear effected by\r\nthe eddies. The \"Devil's jug\" and many similar hollows are thus\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL. AND NAT. HIST. SURVEY. BULLETIN NO. V.,\r\nPL. XXVIII.\r\n\r\nChimney Rock.

XXX.\r\n\r\nView in lower Dalles showing peculiar honeycomb weathering.]\r\n\r\n_The mounds and castle rocks._--In the vicinity of Camp Douglas and over\r\na large area to the east, are still other striking topographic forms,\r\nwhich owe their origin to different conditions, though they were\r\nfashioned by the same forces. Here there are many \"tower\" or \"castle\"\r\nrocks, which rise to heights varying from 75 to 190 feet above the\r\nsurrounding plain. They are remnants of beds which were once continuous\r\nover the low lands above which the hills now rise. In Plates XVII and\r\nXVIII the general character of these hills is shown. The rock of\r\nwhich they are composed is Potsdam sandstone, the same formation which\r\nunderlies most of the area about Baraboo. The effect of the vertical\r\njoints and of horizontal layers of unequal hardness is well shown.\r\nRains, winds, frosts, and roots are still working to compass the\r\ndestruction of these picturesque hills, and the talus of sand bordering\r\nthe \"castle\" is a reminder of the fate which awaits them. These hills\r\nare the more conspicuous and the more instructive since the plain out of\r\nwhich they rise is so flat. It is indeed one of the best examples of a\r\nbase-level plain to be found on the continent.\r\n\r\nThe crests of these hills reach an elevation of between 1,000 and 1,100\r\nfeet. They appear to correspond with the level of the first peneplain\r\nrecognized in the Devil's lake region. It was in the second cycle of\r\nerosion, when their surroundings were brought down to the new\r\nbase-level, that these hills were left. West of Camp Douglas, there are\r\nstill higher elevations, which seem to match Gibraltar rock.\r\n\r\nThe Friendship \"mounds\" north of Kilbourn City, the castellated hills a\r\nfew miles northwest of the same place, and Petenwell peak on the banks\r\nof the Wisconsin (Plate XXXII), are further examples of the same class\r\nof hills. All are of Potsdam sandstone.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the \"castle\" rocks and base-level plain about Camp\r\nDouglas, other features should be mentioned. No other portion of the\r\narea touched upon in this report affords such fine examples of the\r\ndifferent types of erosion topography. In the base-level plain are found\r\n\"old-age\" valleys, broad and shallow, with the stream meandering in a\r\nwide flood-plain. Traveling up such a valley, the topography becomes\r\nyounger and younger, and the various stages mentioned earlier in the\r\ntext, and suggested in Plate XIX, Figs. 1 and 2, and Plate XX, Fig. 1,\r\nare here illustrated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL. AND NAT. HIST. SURVEY. BULLETIN NO. V.,\r\nPL. XXXI.\r\n\r\nStand Rock. Upper end of the Upper Dalles.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL. AND NAT. HIST. SURVEY. BULLETIN NO. V.,\r\nPL.

To the consideration of the\r\ndrift and its history attention is now turned.\r\n\r\n_The drift._--The drift consists of a body of clay, sand, gravel and\r\nbowlders, spread out as a cover of unequal thickness over the rock\r\nformations beneath. These various classes of material may be confusedly\r\ncommingled, or they may be more or less distinctly separated from one\r\nanother. When commingled, all may be in approximately equal proportions,\r\nor any one may predominate over any or all the others to any extent.\r\n\r\nIt was long since recognized that the materials of the drift did not\r\noriginate where they now lie, and that, in consequence, they sustain no\r\ngenetic relationship to the strata on which they rest. Long before the\r\ndrift received any special attention from geologists, it was well known\r\nthat it had been transported from some other locality to that where it\r\nnow occurs. The early conception was that it had been drifted into its\r\npresent position from some outside source by water. It was this\r\nconception of its origin which gave it the name of _drift_. It is now\r\nknown that the drift was deposited by glacier ice and the waters which\r\narose from its melting, but the old name is still retained.\r\n\r\nClearly to understand the origin of the drift, and the method by which\r\nit attained its present distribution, it may be well to consider some\r\nelementary facts and principles concerning climate and its effects, even\r\nat the risk of repeating what is already familiar.\r\n\r\n_Snow fields and ice sheets._--The temperature and the snowfall of a\r\nregion may stand in such a relation to each other that the summer's heat\r\nmay barely suffice to melt the winter's snow. If under these\r\ncircumstances the annual temperature were to be reduced, or the fall of\r\nsnow increased, the summer's heat would fail to melt all the winter's\r\nsnow, and some portion of it would endure through the summer, and\r\nthrough successive summers, constituting a perennial snow-field. Were\r\nthis process once inaugurated, the depth of the snow would increase from\r\nyear to year. The area of the snow-field would be extended at the same\r\ntime, since the snow-field would so far reduce the surrounding\r\ntemperature as to increase the proportion of the annual precipitation\r\nwhich fell as snow. In the course of time, and under favorable\r\nconditions, the area of the snow-field would attain great dimensions,\r\nand the depth of the snow would become very great.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of existing snow fields the lower part of the snow mass\r\nwould eventually be converted into ice. Several factors would conspire\r\nto this end. 1. The pressure of the overlying snow would tend to\r\ncompress the lower portion, and snow rendered sufficiently compact by\r\ncompression would be regarded as ice. 2. Water arising from the melting\r\nof the surface snow by the sun's heat, would percolate through the\r\nsuperficial layers of snow, and, freezing below, take the form of ice.\r\n3. On standing, even without pressure or partial melting, snow appears\r\nto undergo changes of crystallization which render it more compact. In\r\nthese and perhaps other ways, a snow-field becomes an ice-field, the\r\nsnow being restricted to its surface.\r\n\r\nEventually the increase in the depth of the snow and ice in a snow-field\r\nwill give rise to new phenomena. Let a snow and ice field be assumed in\r\nwhich the depth of snow and ice is greatest at the center, with\r\ndiminution toward its edges. The field of snow, if resting on a level\r\nbase, would have some such cross-section as that represented in the\r\ndiagram, Fig. 27.\r\n\r\nWhen the thickness of the ice has become considerable, it is evident\r\nthat the pressure upon its lower and marginal parts will be great. We\r\nare wont to think of ice as a brittle solid. If in its place there were\r\nsome plastic substance which would yield to pressure, the weight of the\r\nice would cause the marginal parts to extend themselves in all\r\ndirections by a sort of flowing motion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.--Diagrammatic cross-section of a field of ice\r\nand snow (c) resting on a level base A-B.]\r\n\r\nUnder great pressure, many substances which otherwise appear to be\r\nsolid, exhibit the characteristics of plastic bodies. Among the\r\nsubstances exhibiting this property, ice is perhaps best known. Brittle\r\nand resistant as it seems, it may yet be molded into almost any\r\ndesirable form if subjected to sufficient pressure, steadily applied\r\nthrough long intervals of time. The changes of form thus produced in ice\r\nare brought about without visible fracture. Concerning the exact nature\r\nof the movement, physicists are not agreed; but the result appears to be\r\nessentially such as would be brought about if the ice were capable of\r\nflowing, with extreme slowness, under great pressure continuously\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nIn the assumed ice-field, there are the conditions for great pressure\r\nand for its continuous application. If the ice be capable of moving as a\r\nplastic body, the weight of the ice would induce gradual movement\r\noutward from the center of the field, so that the area surrounding the\r\nregion where the snow accumulated would gradually be encroached upon by\r\nthe spreading of the ice. Observation shows that this is what takes\r\nplace in every snow-field of sufficient depth. Motion thus brought about\r\nis glacier motion, and ice thus moving is glacier ice.\r\n\r\nOnce in motion, two factors would determine the limit to which the ice\r\nwould extend itself: (1) the rate at which it advances; and (2) the rate\r\nat which the advancing edge is wasted. The rate of advance would depend\r\nupon several conditions, one of which, in all cases, would be the\r\npressure of the ice which started and which perpetuates the motion. If\r\nthe pressure be increased the ice will advance more rapidly, and if it\r\nadvance more rapidly, it will advance farther before it is melted. Other\r\nthings remaining constant, therefore, increase of pressure will cause\r\nthe ice-sheet to extend itself farther from the center of motion.\r\nIncrease of snowfall will increase the pressure of the snow and ice\r\nfield by increasing its mass. If, therefore, the precipitation over a\r\ngiven snow-field be increased for a period of years, the ice-sheet's\r\nmarginal motion will be accelerated, and its area enlarged. A decrease\r\nof precipitation, taken in connection with unchanged wastage would\r\ndecrease the pressure of the ice and retard its movement. If, while the\r\nrate of advance diminished, the rate of wastage remained constant, the\r\nedge of the ice would recede, and the snow and ice field be contracted.\r\n\r\nThe rate at which the edge of the advancing ice is wasted depends\r\nlargely on the climate. If, while the rate of advance remains constant,\r\nthe climate becomes warmer, melting will be more rapid, and the ratio\r\nbetween melting and advance will be increased. The edge of the ice will\r\ntherefore recede. The same result will follow, if, while temperature\r\nremains constant, the atmosphere becomes drier, since this will increase\r\nwastage by evaporation. Were the climate to become warmer and drier at\r\nthe same time, the rate of recession of the ice would be greater than if\r\nbut one of these changes occurred.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the temperature over and about the ice field be\r\nlowered, melting will be diminished, and if the rate of movement be\r\nconstant, the edge of the ice will advance farther than under the\r\nearlier conditions of temperature, since it has more time to advance\r\nbefore it is melted. An increase in the humidity of the atmosphere,\r\nwhile the temperature remains constant, will produce the same result,\r\nsince increased humidity of the atmosphere diminishes evaporation. A\r\ndecrease of temperature, decreasing the melting, and an increase of\r\nhumidity, decreasing the evaporation, would cause the ice to advance\r\nfarther than either change alone, since both changes decrease the\r\nwastage. If, at the same time that conditions so change as to increase\r\nthe rate of movement of the ice, climatic conditions so change as to\r\nreduce the rate of waste, the advance of the ice before it is melted\r\nwill be greater than where only one set of conditions is altered. If,\r\ninstead of favoring advance, the two series of conditions conspire to\r\ncause the ice to recede, the recession will likewise be greater than\r\nwhen but one set of conditions is favorable thereto.\r\n\r\nGreenland affords an example of the conditions here described. A large\r\npart of the half million or more square miles which this body of land is\r\nestimated to contain, is covered by a vast sheet of snow and ice,\r\nthousands of feet in thickness. In this field of snow and ice, there is\r\ncontinuous though slow movement. The ice creeps slowly toward the\r\nborders of the island, advancing until it reaches a position where the\r\nclimate is such as to waste (melt and evaporate) it as rapidly as it\r\nadvances.\r\n\r\nThe edge of the ice does not remain fixed in position. There is reason\r\nto believe that it alternately advances and retreats as the ratio\r\nbetween movement and waste increases or decreases. These oscillations in\r\nposition are doubtless connected with climatic changes. When the ice\r\nedge retreats, it may be because the waste is increased, or because the\r\nsnowfall is decreased, or both. In any case, when the ice edge recedes\r\nfrom the coast, it tends to recede until its edge reaches a position\r\nwhere the melting is less rapid than in its former position, and where\r\nthe advance is counterbalanced by the waste. This represents a condition\r\nof equilibrium so far as the edge of the ice is concerned, and here the\r\nedge of the ice would remain so long as the conditions were unchanged.\r\n\r\nWhen for a period of years the rate of melting of the ice is diminished,\r\nor the snowfall increased, or both, the ice edge advances to a new line\r\nwhere melting is more rapid than at its former edge. The edge of the ice\r\nwould tend to reach a position where waste and advance balance. Here its\r\nadvance would cease, and here its edge would remain so long as climatic\r\nconditions were unchanged.\r\n\r\nIf the conditions determining melting and flowage be continually\r\nchanging, the ice edge will not find a position of equilibrium, but will\r\nadvance when the conditions are favorable for advance, and retreat when\r\nthe conditions are reversed.\r\n\r\nNot only the edge of the ice in Greenland, but the ends of existing\r\nmountain glaciers as well, are subject to fluctuation, and are delicate\r\nindices of variations in the climate of the regions where they occur.\r\n\r\n_The North American ice sheet._--In an area north of the eastern part of\r\nthe United States and in another west of Hudson Bay it is believed that\r\nice sheets similar to that which now covers Greenland began to\r\naccumulate at the beginning of the glacial period. From these areas as\r\ncenters, the ice spread in all directions, partly as the result of\r\naccumulation, and partly as the result of movement induced by the weight\r\nof the ice itself.\r\n\r\nThe ice sheets spreading from these centers came together south of\r\nHudson's bay, and invaded the territory of the United States as a single\r\nsheet, which, at the time of its greatest development, covered a large\r\npart of our country (Plate XXXIII), its area being known by the extent\r\nof the drift which it left behind when it was melted. In the east, it\r\nburied the whole of New England, most of New York, and the northern\r\nparts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Farther west, the southern margin\r\nof the ice crossed the Ohio river in the vicinity of Cincinnati, and\r\npushed out over the uplands a few miles south of the river. In Indiana,\r\nexcept at the extreme east, its margin fell considerably short of the\r\nOhio; in Illinois it reached well toward that river, attaining here its\r\nmost southerly latitude. West of the Mississippi, the line which marks\r\nthe limit of its advance curves to the northward, and follows, in a\r\ngeneral way, the course of the Missouri river. The total area of the\r\nNorth American ice sheet, at the time of its maximum development, has\r\nbeen estimated to have been about 4,000,000 square miles, or about ten\r\ntimes the estimated area of the present ice-field of Greenland.\r\n\r\nWithin the general area covered by the ice, there is an area of several\r\nthousand square miles, mainly in southwestern Wisconsin, where there is\r\nno drift. The ice, for some reason, failed to cover this _driftless\r\narea_ though it overwhelmed the territory on all sides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL. AND NAT. HIST. SURVEY. BULLETIN NO.

The\r\nregion may have been affected by the ice of more than one glacial epoch,\r\nbut the chief results now observable were effected during the last, and\r\nthe others need not be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _The Work of Glacier Ice._\r\n\r\nAs the edge of an ice sheet, or as the end of a glacier, retreats, the\r\nland which it has previously covered is laid bare, and the effects which\r\nthe passage of the ice produced may be seen. In some cases one may\r\nactually go back a short distance beneath the ice now in motion, and see\r\nits mode of work and the results it is effecting. The beds of living\r\nglaciers, and the beds which glaciers have recently abandoned, are found\r\nto present identical features. Because of their greater accessibility,\r\nthe latter offer the better facilities for determining the effects of\r\nglaciation.\r\n\r\nThe conspicuous phenomena of abandoned glacier beds fall into two\r\nclasses, (1) those which pertain to the bed rock over which the ice\r\nmoved, and (2) those which pertain to the drift left by the ice.\r\n\r\n_Erosive work of the ice._--_Effect on topography._--The leading\r\nfeatures of the rock bed over which glacier ice has moved, are easily\r\nrecognized. Its surface is generally smoothed and polished, and\r\nfrequently marked by lines (striae) or grooves, parallel to one another.\r\nAn examination of the bottom of an active glacier discloses the method\r\nby which the polishing and scoring are accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe lower surface of the ice is thickly set with a quantity of clay,\r\nsand, and stony material of various grades of coarseness. These earthy\r\nand stony materials in the base of the ice are the tools with which it\r\nworks. Thus armed, the glacier ice moves slowly forward, resting down\r\nupon the surfaces over which it passes with the whole weight of its\r\nmass, and the grinding action between the stony layer at the base of the\r\nice and the rock bed over which it moves, is effective. If the material\r\nin the bottom of the ice be fine, like clay, the rock bed is polished.\r\nIf coarser materials, harder than the bed-rock, be mingled with the\r\nfine, the rock bed of the glacier will be scratched as well as polished.\r\nIf there are bowlders in the bottom of the ice they may cut grooves or\r\ngorges in the underlying rock. The grooves may subsequently be polished\r\nby the passage over and through them of ice carrying clay or other fine,\r\nearthy matter.\r\n\r\nAll these phases of rock wear may be seen about the termini of receding\r\nglaciers, on territory which they have but recently abandoned. There can\r\nthus be no possible doubt as to the origin of the polishing, planing and\r\nscoring.\r\n\r\nThere are other peculiarities, less easily defined, which characterize\r\nthe surface of glacier beds. The wear effected is not confined to the\r\nmere marking of the surface over which it passes. If prominences of rock\r\nexist in its path, as is often the case, they oppose the movement of the\r\nice, and receive a corresponding measure of abrasion from it. If they be\r\nsufficiently resistant they may force the ice to yield by passing over\r\nor around them; but if they be weak, they are likely to be destroyed.\r\n\r\nAs the ice of the North American ice sheet advanced, seemingly more\r\nrigid when it encountered yielding bodies, and more yielding when it\r\nencountered resistant ones, it denuded the surface of its loose and\r\nmovable materials, and carried them forward. This accumulation of earthy\r\nand stony debris in the bottom of the ice, gave it a rough and grinding\r\nlower surface, which enabled it to abrade the land over which it passed\r\nmuch more effectively than ice alone could have done. Every hill and\r\nevery mound which the ice encountered contested its advance. Every\r\nsufficiently resistant elevation compelled the ice to pass around or\r\nover it; but even in these cases the ice left its marks upon the surface\r\nto which it yielded. The powerful pressure of pure ice, which is\r\nrelatively soft, upon firm hills of rock, which are relatively hard,\r\nwould effect little. The hills would wear the ice, but the effect of the\r\nice on the hills would be slight. But where the ice is supplied with\r\nearthy and stony material derived from the rock itself, the case is\r\ndifferent. Under these conditions, the ice, yielding only under great\r\npressure and as little as may be, rubs its rock-shod base over every\r\nopposing surface, and with greatest severity where it meets with\r\ngreatest resistance. Its action may be compared to that of a huge\r\n\"flexible-rasp\" fitting down snugly over hills and valleys alike, and\r\nworking under enormous pressure.\r\n\r\nThe abrasion effected by a moving body of ice under such conditions\r\nwould be great. Every inch of ice advance would be likely to be attended\r\nby loss to the surface of any obstacle over or around which it is\r\ncompelled to move. The sharp summits of the hills, and all the angular\r\nrugosities of their surfaces would be filed off, and the hills smoothed\r\ndown to such forms as will offer progressively less and less resistance.\r\nIf the process of abrasion be continued long enough, the forms, even of\r\nthe large hills, may be greatly altered, and their dimensions greatly\r\nreduced. Among the results of ice wear, therefore, will be a lowering of\r\nthe hills, and a smoothing and softening of their contours, while their\r\nsurfaces will bear the marks of the tools which fashioned them, and will\r\nbe polished, striated or grooved, according to the nature of the\r\nmaterial which the ice pressed down upon them during its passage. Figs.\r\n28 and 29 show the topographic effects which ice is likely to produce by\r\nerosion. Plate XXXIV is a hill two miles northeast of Merrimac, which\r\nshows how perfectly the wear actually performed corresponds to that\r\nwhich might be inferred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.--A hill before the ice passes over it.]\r\n\r\nA rock hill was sometimes left without covering of drift after having\r\nbeen severely worn by the ice. Such a hill is known as a _roche\r\nmoutonnee_. An example of this type of hill occurs three miles north of\r\neast of Baraboo at the point marked z on Plate XXXVII. This hill,\r\ncomposed of quartzite, is less symmetrical than those shown in Figs. 28\r\nand 29. Its whole surface, not its stoss side only, has been smoothed\r\nand polished by the ice. This hill is the most accessible, the most\r\neasily designated, and, on the whole, the best example of a _roche\r\nmoutonnee_ in the region, though many other hills show something of the\r\nsame form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.--The same hill after it has been eroded by the\r\nice. A the stoss side. B the lee side.]\r\n\r\nIt was not the hills alone which the moving ice affected. Where it\r\nencountered valleys in its course they likewise suffered modification.\r\nWhere the course of a valley was parallel to the direction of the ice\r\nmovement, the ice moved through it. The depth of moving ice is one of\r\nthe determinants of its velocity, and because of the greater depth of\r\nice in valleys, its motion here was more rapid than on the uplands\r\nabove, and its abrading action more powerful. Under these conditions the\r\nvalleys were deepened and widened.\r\n\r\nWhere the courses of the valleys were transverse to the direction of ice\r\nmovement, the case was different. The ice was too viscous to span the\r\nvalleys, and therefore filled them. In this case it is evident that the\r\ngreater depth of the ice in the valley will not accelerate its motion,\r\nsince the ice in the valley-trough and that above it are in a measure\r\nopposed. If left to itself, the ice in the valley would tend to flow in\r\nthe direction of the axis of the valley. But in the case under\r\nconsideration, the ice which lies above the valley depression is in\r\nmotion at right angles to the axis of the valley. Under these\r\ncircumstances three cases might arise:\r\n\r\n(1) If the movement of the ice sheet over the valley were able to push\r\nthe valley ice up the farther slope, and out on the opposite highland,\r\nthis work would retard the movement of the upper ice, since the\r\nresistance to movement would be great. In this case, the thickness of\r\nthe ice is not directly and simply a determinant of its velocity. Under\r\nthese conditions the bottom of the valley would not suffer great\r\nerosion, since ice did not move along it; but that slope of the valley\r\nagainst which the ice movement was projected would suffer great wear\r\n(Fig. 30). The valley would therefore be widened, and the slope\r\nsuffering greatest wear would be reduced to a lower angle. Shallow\r\nvalleys, and those possessing gentle slopes, favor this phase of ice\r\nmovement and valley wear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--Diagram showing effect on valley of ice moving\r\ntransversely across it.]\r\n\r\n(2) The ice in the valley might become stationary, in which case it\r\nmight serve as a bridge for the upper ice to cross on (Fig. 31). In this\r\ncase also the total thickness of ice will not be a determinant of its\r\nvelocity, for it is the thickness of the moving ice only, which\r\ninfluences the velocity. In this case the valley would not suffer much\r\nwear, so long as this condition of things continued. Valleys which have\r\ngreat depth relative to the thickness of the ice, and valleys whose\r\nslopes are steep, favor this phase of movement.\r\n\r\n(3) In valleys whose courses are transverse to the direction of ice\r\nmovement, transverse currents of ice may exist, following the direction\r\nof the valleys. If the thickness of the ice be much greater than the\r\ndepth of the valley, if the valley be capacious, and if one end of it be\r\nopen and much lower than the other, the ice filling it may move along\r\nits axis, while the upper ice continues in its original course at right\r\nangles to the valley. In this case the valley would be deepened and\r\nwidened, but this effect would be due to the movement along its course,\r\nrather than to that transverse to it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31--Diagram to illustrate case where ice fills a\r\nvalley (C) and the upper ice then moves on over the filling.]\r\n\r\nIf the course of a valley were oblique to the direction of ice movement,\r\nits effect on the movement of ice would be intermediate between that of\r\nvalleys parallel to the direction of movement, and those at right angles\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nIt follows from the foregoing that the corrasive effects of ice upon the\r\nsurface over which it passed, were locally dependent on pre-existent\r\ntopography, and its relation to the direction of ice movement. In\r\ngeneral, the effort was to cut down prominences, thus tending to level\r\nthe surface. But when it encountered valleys parallel to its movement\r\nthey were deepened, thus locally increasing relief. Whether the\r\nreduction of the hills exceeded the deepening of the valleys, or whether\r\nthe reverse was true, so far as corrasion alone is concerned, is\r\nuncertain. But whatever the effect of the erosive effect of ice action\r\nupon the total amount of relief, the effect upon the contours was to\r\nmake them more gentle. Not only were the sharp hills rounded off, but\r\neven the valleys which were deepened were widened as well, and in the\r\nprocess their slopes became more gentle. A river-erosion topography,\r\nmodified by the wearing (not the depositing) action of the ice, would be\r\nnotably different from the original, by reason of its gentler slopes and\r\nsofter contours (Figs. 28 and 29).\r\n\r\n_Deposition by the ice. Effect on topography._--On melting, glacier ice\r\nleaves its bed covered with the debris which it gathered during its\r\nmovement. Had this debris been equally distributed on and in and beneath\r\nthe ice during its movement, and had the conditions of deposition been\r\neverywhere the same, the drift would constitute a mantle of uniform\r\nthickness over the underlying rock. Such a mantle of drift would not\r\ngreatly alter the topography; it would simply raise the surface by an\r\namount equal to the thickness of the drift, leaving elevations and\r\ndepressions of the same magnitude as before, and sustaining the same\r\nrelations to one another. But the drift carried by the ice, in whatever\r\nposition, was not equally distributed during transportation, and the\r\nconditions under which it was deposited were not uniform, so that it\r\nproduced more or less notable changes in the topography of the surface\r\non which it was deposited.\r\n\r\nThe unequal distribution of the drift is readily understood. The larger\r\npart of the drift transported by the ice was carried in its basal\r\nportion; but since the surface over which the ice passed was variable,\r\nit yielded a variable amount of debris to the ice. Where it was hilly,\r\nthe friction between it and the ice was greater than where it was plain,\r\nand the ice carried away more load. From areas where the surface was\r\noverspread by a great depth of loose material favorably disposed for\r\nremoval, more debris was taken than from areas where material in a\r\ncondition to be readily transported was meager. Because of the\r\ntopographic diversity and lithological heterogeneity of the surface of\r\nthe country over which it passed, some portions of the ice carried much\r\nmore drift than others, and when the ice finally melted, greater depths\r\nof drift were left in some places than in others. Not all of the\r\nmaterial transported by the ice was carried forward until the ice\r\nmelted. Some of it was probably carried but a short distance from its\r\noriginal position before it lodged. Drift was thus accumulating at some\r\npoints beneath the ice during its onward motion. At such points the\r\nsurface was being built up; at other points, abrasion was taking place,\r\nand the surface was being cut down. The drift mantle of any region does\r\nnot, therefore, represent simply the material which was on and in and\r\nbeneath the ice of that place at the time of its melting, but it\r\nrepresents, in addition, all that lodged beneath the ice during its\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nThe constant tendency was for the ice to carry a considerable part of\r\nits load forward toward its thinned edge, and there to leave it. It\r\nfollows that if the edge of the ice remained constant in position for\r\nany considerable period of time, large quantities of drift would have\r\naccumulated under its marginal portion, giving rise to a belt of\r\nrelatively thick drift. Other things being equal, the longer the time\r\nduring which the position of the edge was stationary, the greater the\r\naccumulation of drift. Certain ridge-like belts where the drift is\r\nthicker than on either hand, are confidently believed to mark the\r\nposition where the edge of the ice-sheet stood for considerable periods\r\nof time.\r\n\r\nBecause of the unequal amounts of material carried by different parts of\r\nthe ice, and because of the unequal and inconstant conditions of\r\ndeposition under the body of the ice and its edge, the mantle of drift\r\nhas a very variable thickness; and a mantle of drift of variable\r\nthickness cannot fail to modify the topography of the region it covers.\r\nThe extent of the modification will depend on the extent of the\r\nvariation. This amounts in the aggregate, to hundreds of feet. The\r\ncontinental ice sheet, therefore, modified the topography of the region\r\nit covered, not only by the wear it effected, but also by the deposits\r\nit made.\r\n\r\nIn some places it chanced that the greater thicknesses of drift were\r\nleft in the positions formerly marked by valleys. Locally the body of\r\ndrift was so great that valleys were completely filled, and therefore\r\ncompletely obliterated as surface features. Less frequently, drift not\r\nonly filled the valleys but rose even higher over their former positions\r\nthan on either side. In other places the greater depths of drift,\r\ninstead of being deposited in the valleys, were left on pre-glacial\r\nelevations, building them up to still greater heights. In short, the\r\nmantle of drift of unequal thickness was laid down upon the rock\r\nsurface in such a manner that the thicker parts sometimes rest on hills\r\nand ridges, sometimes on slopes, sometimes on plains, and sometimes in\r\nvalleys.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.--Diagrammatic section showing relation of drift\r\nto underlying rock, where the drift is thick relative to the relief of\r\nthe rock. a and b represent the location of post-glacial valleys.]\r\n\r\nThese relations are suggested by Figs. 32 and 33. From them it will be\r\nseen that in regions where the thickness of the drift is great, relative\r\nto the relief of the underlying rock, the topography may be completely\r\nchanged. Not only may some of the valleys be obliterated by being\r\nfilled, but some of the hills may be obliterated by having the lower\r\nland between them built up to their level. In regions where the\r\nthickness of the drift is slight, relative to the relief of the rock\r\nbeneath, the hills cannot be buried, and the valleys cannot be\r\ncompletely filled, so that the relative positions of the principal\r\ntopographic features will remain much the same after the deposition of\r\nthe drift, as before (Fig. 33).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--Diagrammatic section showing relation of drift\r\nto underlying rock where the drift is thin relative to the relief of the\r\nunderlying rock.]\r\n\r\nIn case the pre-glacial valleys were filled and the hills buried, the\r\nnew valleys which the surface waters will in time cut in the drift\r\nsurface will have but little correspondence in position with those\r\nwhich existed before the ice incursion. A new system of valleys, and\r\ntherefore a new system of ridges and hills, will be developed, in some\r\nmeasure independent of the old. These relations are illustrated by Fig.\r\n32.\r\n\r\nInequalities in the thickness of drift lead to a still further\r\nmodification of the surface. It frequently happened that in a plane or\r\nnearly plane region a slight thickness of drift was deposited at one\r\npoint, while all about it much greater thicknesses were left. The area\r\nof thin drift would then constitute a depression, surrounded by a higher\r\nsurface built up by the thicker deposits. Such depressions would at\r\nfirst have no outlets, and are therefore unlike the depressions shaped\r\nby rain and river erosion. The presence of depressions without outlets\r\nis one of the marks of a drift-covered (glaciated) country. In these\r\ndepressions water may collect, forming lakes or ponds, or in some cases\r\nonly marshes and bogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   DIRECTION OF ICE MOVEMENT.\r\n\r\nThe direction in which glacier ice moved may be determined in various\r\nways, even after the ice has disappeared. The shapes of the rock hills\r\nover which the ice passed, the direction from which the materials of the\r\ndrift came, and the course of the margin of the drift, all show that the\r\nice of south central Wisconsin was moving in a general southwest\r\ndirection. In the rock hills, this is shown by the greater wear of their\r\nnortheast (\"stoss\") sides (Plate XXXIV). From the course of the drift\r\nmargin, the general direction of movement may be inferred when it is\r\nremembered that the tendency of glacier ice on a plane surface is to\r\nmove at right angles to its margin.\r\n\r\nFor the exact determination of the direction of ice movement, recourse\r\nmust be had to the striae on the bed-rock. Were the striated rock surface\r\nperfectly plane, and were the striae even lines, they would only tell\r\nthat the ice was moving in one of two directions. But the rock surface\r\nis not usually perfectly plane, nor the striae even lines, and between\r\nthe two directions which lines alone might suggest, it is usually\r\npossible to decide. The minor prominences and depressions in the rock\r\nsurface were shaped according to the same principles that govern the\r\nshaping of hills (Fig. 29) and valleys (Fig. 30); that is, the stoss\r\nsides of the minor prominences, and the distal sides of small\r\ndepressions suffered the more wear. With a good compass, the direction\r\nof the striae may be measured to within a fraction of a degree, and thus\r\nthe direction of ice movement in a particular place be definitely\r\ndetermined. The striae which have been determined about Baraboo are shown\r\non Plate II.\r\n\r\n_Effect of topography on movement._--The effect of glaciation on\r\ntopography has been sketched, but the topography in turn exerted an\r\nimportant influence on the direction of ice movement. The extreme degree\r\nof topographic influence is seen in mountain regions like the Alps,\r\nwhere most of the glaciers are confined strictly to the valleys.\r\n\r\nAs an ice sheet invades a region, it advances first and farthest along\r\nthe lines of least resistance. In a rough country with great relief,\r\ntongues or lobes of ice would push forward in the valleys, while the\r\nhills or other prominences would tend to hold back or divide the onward\r\nmoving mass. The edge of an ice sheet in such a region would be\r\nirregular. The marginal lobes of ice occupying the valleys would be\r\nseparated by re-entrant angles marking the sites of hills and ridges.\r\n\r\nIf the ice crossed a plane surface above which rose a notable ridge or\r\nhill, the first effect of the hill would be to indent the ice. The ice\r\nwould move forward on either side, and if its thickness became\r\nsufficiently great, the parts moving forward on either side would again\r\nunite beyond it. A hill thus surrounded by ice is a nunatak. Later, as\r\nthe advancing mass of ice became thicker, it might completely cover the\r\nhill; but the thickness of ice passing over the hill would be less than\r\nthat passing on either side by an amount equal to the height of the\r\nhill. It follows that as ice encounters an isolated elevation, three\r\nstages in its contest with the obstruction may be recognized: (1) the\r\nstage when the ridge or hill acts as a wedge, dividing the moving ice\r\ninto lobes, Fig. 34; (2) the nunatak stage, when the ice has pushed\r\nforward and reunited beyond the hill, Fig. 35; (3) the stage when the ice\r\nhas become sufficiently deep to cover the hill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.--Diagrammatic representation of the effect of a\r\nhill on the edge of the ice.]\r\n\r\nAfter the ice has disappeared, the influence of the obstruction might be\r\nfound in the disposition of the drift. If recession began during the\r\nfirst stage, that is, when the ice edge was separated into lobes, the\r\nmargin of the drift should be lobate, and would loop back around the\r\nridge from its advanced position on either side. If recession began\r\nduring the second stage, that is, when the lobes had become confluent\r\nand completely surrounded the hill, a _driftless area_ would appear in\r\nthe midst of drift. If recession began during the third stage, that is,\r\nafter the ice had moved on over the obstruction, the evidence of the\r\nsequence might be obliterated; but if the ice moved but a short distance\r\nbeyond the hill, the thinner ice over the hill would have advanced less\r\nfar than the thicker ice on either side (Fig. 35), and the margin of\r\nthe drift would show a re-entrant pointing back toward the hill, though\r\nnot reaching it. All these conditions are illustrated in the Devil's\r\nlake region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.--Same as Fig. 34, when the ice has advanced\r\nfarther.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Limit of the Ice._\r\n\r\nThe region under description is partly covered with drift, and partly\r\nfree from it. The limit of the ice, at the time of its maximum expansion\r\nis well defined at many points, and the nature and position of the drift\r\nlimit are so unique as to merit attention (see Plates II and XXXVII).\r\nThey illustrate many of the principles already discussed.\r\n\r\nThe ice which covered the region was the western margin of the Green Bay\r\nlobe (Fig. 36) of the last continental ice sheet. Its limit in this\r\nregion is marked by a ridge-like accumulation of drift, the _terminal\r\nmoraine_, which here has a general north-south direction. The region\r\nmay have been affected by the ice of more than one epoch, but since the\r\nice of the last epoch advanced as far to the west in this region as that\r\nof any earlier epoch, the moraine is on the border between the glaciated\r\ncountry to the east, and the driftless area to the west (Plates I and\r\nII). That part of the moraine which lies west of the Wisconsin river\r\nfollows a somewhat sinuous course from Kilbourn City to a point a short\r\ndistance north of Prairie du Sac. The departures from this general\r\ncourse are especially significant of the behavior of glacier ice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.--Map showing relations of lobes of ice during\r\nthe Wisconsin ice epoch, to the driftless area.]\r\n\r\nIn the great depression between the quartzite ranges, the moraine bends\r\nwestward, showing that the ice advanced farther on the lowlands than on\r\nthe ridges. As the moraine of this low area approaches the south range,\r\nit curves to the east. At the point southwest of Baraboo where the\r\neasterly curve begins to show itself, the moraine lies at the north base\r\nof the quartzite range; but as it is traced eastward, it is found to lie\r\nhigher and higher on the slope of the range, until it reaches the crest\r\nnearly seven miles from the point where the eastward course was assumed.\r\nAt this point it crosses the range, and, once across the crest, it turns\r\npromptly to the westward on the lower land to the south. Here the ice\r\nadvanced up the valley between the East bluff (east of the lake) and the\r\nDevil's nose (Plate XXXVII), again illustrating the fact that lowlands\r\nfavor ice advance. The valley between the Devil's nose and the East\r\nbluff is a narrow one, and the ice advanced through it nearly to the\r\npresent site of the lake. Meanwhile the restraining influence of the\r\n\"nose\" was making itself felt, and the margin of the ice curved back\r\nfrom the bottom of the bluff near Kirkland, to the top of the bluff at\r\nthe end of the nose. Here the edge of the ice crossed the point of the\r\nnose, and after rounding it, turned abruptly to the west. Thence its\r\nedge lay along the south slope of the ridge, descending from the crest\r\nof the ridge at the nose, to the base of the ridge two miles farther\r\nwest. Here the ice reached its limit on the lowland, and its edge, as\r\nmarked by the moraine, turned southward, reaching the Wisconsin river\r\nabout a mile and a half above Prairie du Sac.\r\n\r\nThe course of the terminal moraine across the ridges is such as the\r\nmargin of the ice would normally have when it advanced into a region of\r\ngreat relief. The great loop in the moraine with its eastern extremity\r\nat k, Plate XXXVII, is explained by the presence of the quartzite\r\nridge which retarded the advancing ice while it moved forward on either\r\nside. The minor loop around the Devil's nose is explained in the same\r\nway. Both the main loop, and the smaller one on the nose, illustrate\r\nthe point made earlier in the text.\r\n\r\nThe narrow and curious loop at m, is of a slightly different origin,\r\nthough in principle the same. It is in the lee of a high point in the\r\nquartzite ridge. The ice surmounted this point, and descended its\r\nwestern slope; but the thickness of the ice passing over the summit was\r\nso slight that it advanced but a short distance down the slope before\r\nits force was exhausted, while the thicker ice on either side advanced\r\nfarther before it was melted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Glacial Deposits._\r\n\r\nBefore especial reference is made to the drift of this particular\r\nregion, it will be well to consider the character of drift deposits in\r\ngeneral. When the ice of the continental glacier began its motion, it\r\ncarried none of the stony and earthy debris which constitute the drift.\r\nThese materials were derived from the surface over which the ice moved.\r\n\r\nFrom the method by which it was gathered, it is evident that the drift\r\nof any locality may contain fragments of rock of every variety which\r\noccurs along the route followed by the ice which reached that locality.\r\nWhere the ice had moved far, and where there were frequent changes in\r\nthe character of the rock constituting its bed, the variety of materials\r\nin the drift is great. The heterogeneity of the drift arising from the\r\ndiverse nature of the rocks which contributed to it is _lithological\r\nheterogeneity_--a term which implies the commingling of materials\r\nderived from different rock formations. Thus it is common to find pieces\r\nof sandstone, limestone, quartzite, granite, gneiss, schist, etc.,\r\nintimately commingled in the drift, wherever the ice which produced it\r\npassed over formations of these several sorts of rock. Lithological\r\nheterogeneity is one of the notable characteristics of glacial\r\nformations.\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic of the drift is its _physical heterogeneity_. As\r\nfirst gathered from the bed of moving ice, some of the materials of the\r\ndrift were fine and some coarse. The tendency of the ice in all cases\r\nwas to reduce its load to a still finer condition. Some of the softer\r\nmaterials, such as soft shale, were crushed or ground to powder, forming\r\nwhat is known in common parlance as clay. Clayey (fine) material is\r\nlikewise produced by the grinding action of ice-carried bowlders upon\r\nthe rock-bed, and upon one another. Other sorts of rock, such as soft\r\nsandstone, were reduced to the physical condition of sand, instead of\r\nclay, and from sand to bowlders all grades of coarseness and fineness\r\nare represented in the glacial drift.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL.

XXXV.\r\n\r\nCut in drift, showing its physical heterogeneity.]\r\n\r\nSince the ice does not assort the material which it carries, as water\r\ndoes, the clay, sand, gravel and bowlders will not, by the action of the\r\nice, be separated from one another. They are therefore not stratified.\r\nAs left by the ice, these physically heterogeneous materials are\r\nconfusedly commingled. The finer parts constitute a matrix in which the\r\ncoarser are embedded.\r\n\r\nPhysical heterogeneity (Plate XXXV), therefore, is another\r\ncharacteristic of glacial drift. It is not to be understood that the\r\nproportions of these various physical elements, clay, sand, gravel, and\r\nbowlders, are constant. Locally any one of them may predominate over any\r\nor all the others to any extent.\r\n\r\nSince lithological and physical heterogeneity are characteristics of\r\nglacial drift, they together afford a criterion which is often of\r\nservice in distinguishing glacial drift from other surface formations.\r\nIt follows that this double heterogeneity constitutes a feature which\r\ncan be utilized in determining the former extension of existing\r\nglaciers, as well as the former existence of glaciers where glaciers do\r\nnot now exist.\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic of glacial drift, and one which clearly\r\ndistinguishes it from all other formations with which it might be\r\nconfounded, is easily understood from its method of formation. If the\r\nice in its motion holds down rock debris upon the rock surface over\r\nwhich it passes with such pressure as to polish and striate the\r\nbed-rock, the material carried will itself suffer wear comparable to\r\nthat which it inflicts. Thus the stones, large and small, of glacial\r\ndrift, will be smoothed and striated. This sort of wear on the\r\ntransported blocks of rock, is effected both by the bed-rock reacting on\r\nthe bowlders transported over it, and by bowlders acting on one another\r\nin and under the ice. The wear of bowlders by bowlders is effected\r\nwherever adjacent ones are carried along at different rates. Since the\r\nrate of motion of the ice is different in different parts of the\r\nglacier, the mutual abrasion of transported materials is a process\r\nconstantly in operation. A large proportion of the transported stone and\r\nblocks of rock may thus eventually become striated.\r\n\r\nFrom the nature of the wear to which the stones are subjected when\r\ncarried in the base of the ice, it is easy to understand that their\r\nshapes must be different from those of water-worn materials. The latter\r\nare rolled over and over, and thus lose all their angles and assume a\r\nmore or less rounded form. The former, held more or less firmly in the\r\nice, and pressed against the underlying rock or rock debris as they are\r\ncarried slowly forward, have their faces planed and striated. The\r\nplanation and striation of a stone need not be confined to its under\r\nsurface. On either side or above it other stones, moving at different\r\nrates, are made to abrade it, so that its top and sides may be planed\r\nand scored. If the ice-carried stones shift their positions, as they may\r\nunder various circumstances, new faces will be worn. The new face thus\r\nplaned off may meet those developed at an earlier time at sharp angles,\r\naltogether unlike anything which water-wear is capable of producing. The\r\nstone thus acted upon shows a surface bounded by planes and more or less\r\nbeveled, instead of a rounded surface such as water wear produces. We\r\nfind, then, in the shape of the bowlders and smaller stones of the\r\ndrift, and in the markings upon their surfaces, additional criteria for\r\nthe identification of glacier drift (Plate XXXVI).\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of glacial drift, so far as concerns its\r\nconstitution, may then be enumerated as, (1) its lithological, and (2)\r\nphysical heterogeneity; (3) the shapes, and (4) the markings of the stones\r\nof the drift. In structure, the drift which is strictly glacial, is\r\nunstratified.\r\n\r\nIn the broadest sense of the term, all deposits made by glacier ice are\r\n_moraines_. Those made beneath the ice and back from its edge constitute\r\nthe _ground moraine_, and are distinguished from the considerable\r\nmarginal accumulations which, under certain conditions, are accumulated\r\nat or near the margin. These marginal accumulations are _terminal\r\nmoraines_. Associated with the moraines which are the deposits of the\r\nice directly, there are considerable bodies of stratified gravel and\r\nsand, the structure of which shows that they were laid down by water.\r\nThis is to be especially noted, since lack of stratification is\r\npopularly supposed to be the especial mark of the formations to which\r\nthe ice gave rise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL. AND NAT. HIST. SURVEY. BULLETIN NO. V.,\r\nPL. XXXVI.\r\n\r\nGlaciated stones, showing both form and striae. (Matz.)]\r\n\r\nThese deposits of stratified drift lie partly beyond the terminal\r\nmoraine, and partly within it. They often sustain very complicated\r\nrelations both to the ground and terminal moraines.\r\n\r\nThe drift as a whole is therefore partly stratified and partly\r\nunstratified. Structurally the two types are thoroughly distinct, but\r\ntheir relations are often most complex, both horizontally and\r\nvertically. A fuller consideration of these relations will be found on a\r\nlater page.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _The Ground Moraine._\r\n\r\nThe ground moraine constitutes the great body of the glacial drift.\r\n_Bowlder clay_, a term descriptive of its constitution in some places,\r\nand _till_, are other terms often applied to the ground moraine. The\r\nground moraine consists of all the drift which lodged beneath the ice\r\nduring its advance, all that was deposited back from its edge while its\r\nmargin was farthest south, and most of that which was deposited while\r\nthe ice was retreating. From this mode of origin it is readily seen that\r\nthe ground moraine should be essentially as widespread as the ice\r\nitself. Locally, however, it failed of deposition. Since it constitutes\r\nthe larger part of the drift, the characteristics already enumerated\r\nas belonging to drift in general are the characteristics of the\r\ntill. Wherever obstacles to the progress of the ice lay in its path,\r\nthere was a chance that these obstacles, rising somewhat into the\r\nlower part of the ice, would constitute barriers against which debris in\r\nthe lower part of the ice would lodge. It might happen also that the\r\nice, under a given set of conditions favoring erosion, would gather a\r\ngreater load of rock-debris than could be transported under the changed\r\nconditions into which its advance brought it. In this case, some part of\r\nthe load would be dropped and over-ridden. Especially near the margin of\r\nthe ice where its thickness was slight and diminishing, the ice must\r\nhave found itself unable to carry forward the loads of debris which it\r\nhad gathered farther back where its action was more vigorous. It will be\r\nreadily seen that if not earlier deposited, all material gathered by the\r\nunder surface of the ice would ultimately find itself at the edge of the\r\nglacier, for given time enough, ablation will waste all that part of the\r\nice occupying the space between the original position of the debris, and\r\nthe margin of the ice. Under the thinned margin of the ice, therefore,\r\nconsiderable accumulations of drift must have been taking place while\r\nthe ice was advancing. While the edge of the ice sheet was advancing\r\ninto territory before uninvaded, the material accumulated beneath its\r\nedge at one time, found itself much farther from the margin at another\r\nand later time. Under the more forcible ice action back from the margin,\r\nthe earlier accumulations, made under the thin edge, were partially or\r\nwholly removed by the thicker ice of a later time, and carried down to\r\nor toward the new and more advanced margin. Here they were deposited, to\r\nbe in turn disturbed and transported still farther by the farther\r\nadvance of the ice.\r\n\r\nSince in its final retreat the margin of the ice must have stood at all\r\npoints once covered by it, these submarginal accumulations of drift must\r\nhave been made over the whole country once covered by the ice. The\r\ndeposits of drift made beneath the marginal part of the ice during its\r\nretreat, would either cover the deposits made under the body of the ice\r\nat an earlier time, or be left alongside them. The constitution of the\r\ntwo phases of till, that deposited during the advance of the ice, and\r\nthat deposited during its retreat, is essentially the same, and there\r\nis nothing in their relative positions to sharply differentiate them.\r\nThey are classed together as _subglacial till_.\r\n\r\nSubglacial till was under the pressure of the overlying ice. In keeping\r\nwith these conditions of accumulation, the till often possesses a\r\nfirmness suggestive of great compression. Where its constitution is\r\nclayey it is often remarkably tough. Where this is the case, the quality\r\nhere referred to has given rise to the suggestive name \"hard pan.\" Where\r\nthe constitution of the till is sandy, rather than clayey, this firmness\r\nand toughness are less developed, or may be altogether wanting, since\r\nsand cannot be compressed into coherent masses like clay.\r\n\r\n_Constitution._--The till is composed of the more or less comminuted\r\nmaterials derived from the land across which the ice passed. The soil\r\nand all the loose materials which covered the rock entered into its\r\ncomposition. Where the ice was thick and its action vigorous, it not\r\nonly carried away the loose material which it found in its path, but,\r\narmed with this material, it abraded the underlying rock, wearing down\r\nits surface and detaching large and small blocks of rock from it. It\r\nfollows that the constitution of the till at any point is dependent upon\r\nthe nature of the soil and rock from which it was derived.\r\n\r\nIf sandstone be the formation which has contributed most largely to the\r\ntill, the matrix of the till will be sandy. Where limestone instead of\r\nsandstone made the leading contribution to it, the till has a more\r\nearthy or clayey matrix. Any sort of rock which may be very generally\r\nreduced to a fine state of division under the mechanical action of the\r\nice, will give rise to clayey till.\r\n\r\nThe nature and the number of the bowlders in the till, no less than the\r\nfiner parts, depend on the character of the rock overridden. A hard and\r\nresistant rock, such as quartzite, will give rise to more bowlders in\r\nproportion to the total amount of material furnished to the ice, than\r\nwill softer rock. Shale or soft sandstone, possessing relatively slight\r\nresistance, will be much more completely crushed. They will, therefore,\r\nyield proportionately fewer bowlders than harder formations, and more\r\nof the finer constituents of till.\r\n\r\nThe bowlders taken up by the ice as it advanced over one sort of rock\r\nand another, possessed different degrees of resistance. The softer ones\r\nwere worn to smaller dimensions or crushed with relative ease and speed.\r\nBowlders of soft rock are, therefore, not commonly found in any\r\nabundance at great distances from their sources. The harder ones yielded\r\nless readily to abrasion, and were carried much farther before being\r\ndestroyed, though even such must have suffered constant reduction in\r\nsize during their subglacial journey. In general it is true that\r\nbowlders in the till, near their parent formations, are larger and less\r\nworn than those which have been transported great distances.\r\n\r\nThe ice which covered this region had come a great distance and had\r\npassed over rock formations of many kinds. The till therefore contains\r\nelements derived from various formations; that is, it is lithologically\r\nheterogeneous. This heterogeneity cannot fail to attract the attention\r\nof one examining any of the many exposures of drift about Baraboo at\r\nroad gradings, or in the cuts along the railway. Among the stones in the\r\ndrift at these exposures are limestone, sandstone, quartzite, diabase,\r\ngabbro, gneiss, granite, schist, and porphyry, together with pieces of\r\nflint and chert.\r\n\r\nSuch an array may be found at any of the exposures within the immediate\r\nvicinity of Devil's lake. To the north, and a few miles to the south of\r\nthe Baraboo ranges, the quartzite from these bluffs, and the porphyry\r\nfrom the point marked h in Plate II, are wanting, though other\r\nvarieties of porphyry are present. The ice moved in a general\r\nwest-southwest direction in this region, and the quartzite in the drift,\r\nso far as derived from the local formation, is therefore restricted to a\r\nnarrow belt.\r\n\r\nThe physical heterogeneity may be seen at all exposures, and is\r\nillustrated in Plate XXXV. The larger stones of the drift are\r\nusually of some hard variety of rock. Near the Baraboo ranges, the local\r\nquartzite often predominates among the bowlders, and since such\r\nbowlders have not been carried far, they are often little worn. Away\r\nfrom the ranges, the bowlders are generally of some crystalline rock,\r\nsuch as granite and diabase. Bowlders of these sorts of rock are from a\r\nmuch more distant source, and are usually well worn.\r\n\r\nIn general the till of any locality is made up largely of material\r\nderived from the formations close at hand. This fact seems to afford\r\nsufficient warrant for the conclusion that a considerable amount of\r\ndeposition must have gone on beneath the ice during its movement, even\r\nback from its margin. To take a concrete illustration, it would seem\r\nthat the drift of southeastern Wisconsin should have had a larger\r\ncontribution than it has of material derived from Canadian territory, if\r\nmaterial once taken up by the ice was all or chiefly carried down to its\r\nthinned edge before deposition. The fact that so little of the drift\r\ncame from these distant sources would seem to prove that a large part of\r\nthe material moved by the ice, is moved a relatively short distance\r\nonly. The ice must be conceived of as continually depositing parts of\r\nits load, and parts which it has carried but a short distance, as it\r\ntakes up new material from the territory newly invaded.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with the character of till in general, that about Devil's\r\nlake was derived largely from the sandstone, limestone and quartzite of\r\nthe immediate vicinity, while a much smaller part of it came from more\r\ndistant sources. This is especially noticeable in the fine material,\r\nwhich is made up mostly of the comminuted products of the local rock.\r\n\r\n_Topography._--The topography of the ground moraine is in general the\r\ntopography already described in considering the modification of\r\npreglacial topography effected by ice deposition. As left by the ice,\r\nits surface was undulating. The undulations did not take the form of\r\nhills and ridges with intervening valleys, but of swells and depressions\r\nstanding in no orderly relationship to one another. Undrained\r\ndepressions are found in the ground moraine, but they are, as a rule,\r\nbroader and shallower than the \"kettles\" common to terminal moraines.\r\n\r\nIt is in the broad, shallow depressions of the ground moraine that many\r\nof the lakes and more of the marshes of southeastern Wisconsin are\r\nlocated.\r\n\r\nThe rolling, undulating topography characteristic of ground moraines is\r\nwell shown about the City of Baraboo and between that point and the\r\nlake, and at many less easily designated points about Merrimac.\r\n\r\nIn thickness the ground moraine reaches at least 160 feet, though its\r\naverage is much less--too little to obliterate the greater topographic\r\nfeatures of the rock beneath. It is, however, responsible for many of\r\nthe details of the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Terminal Moraines._\r\n\r\nThe marginal portion of the ice sheet was more heavily loaded--certainly\r\nmore heavily loaded relative to its thickness--than any other. Toward\r\nits margin the thinned ice was constantly losing its transportive power,\r\nand at its edge this power was altogether gone. Since the ice was\r\ncontinually bringing drift down to this position and leaving it there,\r\nthe rate of drift accumulation must have been greater, on the average,\r\nbeneath the edge of the ice than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhenever, at any stage in its history, the edge of the ice remained\r\nessentially constant in position for a long period of time, the\r\ncorresponding submarginal accumulation of drift was great, and when the\r\nice melted, the former site of the stationary edge would be marked by a\r\nbroad ridge or belt of drift, thicker than that on either side. Such\r\nthickened belts of drift are _terminal moraines_. It will be seen that a\r\nterminal moraine does not necessarily mark the terminus of the ice at\r\nthe time of its greatest advance, but rather its terminus at any time\r\nwhen its edge was stationary or nearly so.\r\n\r\nFrom the conditions of their development it will be seen that these\r\nsubmarginal moraines may be made up of materials identical with those\r\nwhich constitute the ground moraine, and such is often the case. But\r\nwater arising from the melting of the ice, played a much more\r\nimportant role at its margin than farther back beneath it. One result of\r\nits greater activity may be seen in the greater coarseness which\r\ngenerally characterizes the material of the terminal moraine as compared\r\nwith that of the adjacent ground moraine. This is partly because the\r\nwater carried away such of the finer constituents as it was able to\r\ntransport, leaving the coarser behind. Further evidence of the great\r\nactivity of water near the margin of the ice is to be seen in the\r\nrelatively large amount of assorted and stratified sand and gravel\r\nassociated with the terminal moraine.\r\n\r\nSuch materials as were carried on the ice were dropped at its edge when\r\nthe ice which bore them melted from beneath. If the surface of the ice\r\ncarried many bowlders, many would be dropped along the line of its edge\r\nwherever it remained stationary for any considerable period of time. A\r\nterminal moraine therefore embraces (1) the thick belt of drift\r\naccumulated beneath the edge of the ice while it was stationary, or\r\nnearly so; and (2) such debris as was carried on the surface of the ice\r\nand dumped at its margin. In general the latter is relatively\r\nunimportant.\r\n\r\nAt various stages in its final retreat, the ice made more or less\r\nprotracted halts. These halting places are marked by marginal moraines\r\nof greater or less size, depending on the duration of the stop, and the\r\namount of load carried.\r\n\r\nA terminal moraine is not the sharp and continuous ridge we are wont to\r\nthink it. It is a belt of thick drift, rather than a ridge, though it is\r\noften somewhat ridge-like. In width, it varies from a fraction of a mile\r\nto several miles. In the region under consideration it is rarely more\r\nthan fifty feet high, and rarely less than a half mile wide, and a ridge\r\nof this height and width is not a conspicuous topographic feature in a\r\nregion where the relief is so great as that of the Devil's lake region.\r\n\r\n_Topography of terminal moraines._--The most distinctive feature of a\r\nterminal moraine is not its ridge-like character, but its peculiar\r\ntopography. In general, it is marked by depressions without outlets,\r\nassociated with hillocks and short ridges comparable in dimensions to\r\nthe depressions. Both elevations and depressions are, as a rule, more\r\nabrupt than in the ground moraine. In the depressions there are many\r\nmarshes, bogs, ponds and small lakes. The shapes and the abundance of\r\nround and roundish hills have locally given rise to such names as \"The\r\nKnobs,\" \"Short Hills,\" etc. Elsewhere the moraine has been named the\r\n\"Kettle Range\" from the number of kettle-like depressions in its\r\nsurface. It is to be kept in mind that it is the association of the\r\n\"knobs\" and \"kettles,\" rather than either feature alone, which is the\r\ndistinctive mark of terminal moraine topography.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.--Sketch of terminal moraine topography, on the\r\nquartzite ridge east of Devil's lake. (Matz.)]\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the topography of terminal moraines was developed is\r\nworthy of note. In the first place, the various parts of the ice margin\r\ncarried unequal amounts of debris. This alone would have caused the\r\nmoraine of any region to have been of unequal height and width at\r\ndifferent points. In the second place, the margin of the ice, while\r\nmaintaining the same _general_ position during the making of a moraine,\r\nwas yet subject to many minor oscillations. It doubtless receded to some\r\nslight extent because of increased melting during the summer, to advance\r\nagain during the winter. In its recession, the ice margin probably did\r\nnot remain exactly parallel to its former position. If some parts\r\nreceded more than others, the details of the line of its margin may have\r\nbeen much changed during a temporary retreat. When the ice again\r\nadvanced, its margin may have again changed its form in some slight\r\nmeasure, so as to be parallel neither with its former advanced position,\r\nnor with its position after its temporary retreat. With each successive\r\noscillation of the edge, the details of the margin may have altered, and\r\nat each stage the marginal deposits corresponded with the edge. There\r\nmight even be considerable changes in the edge of the ice without any\r\ngeneral recession or advance, as existing glaciers show.\r\n\r\nIt was probably true of the margin of the American ice sheet, as of\r\nexisting glaciers, that there were periods of years when the edge of the\r\nice receded, followed by like periods when it remained stationary or\r\nnearly so, and these in turn followed by periods of advance. During any\r\nadvance, the deposits made during the period of recession would be\r\noverridden and disturbed or destroyed.\r\n\r\nIf the ice were to retreat and advance repeatedly during a considerable\r\nperiod of time, always within narrow limits, and if during this\r\noscillation the details of its margin were frequently changing, the\r\nresult would be a complex or \"tangle\" of minor morainic ridges of\r\nvariable heights and widths. Between and among the minor ridges there\r\nwould be depressions of various sizes and shapes. Thus, it is conceived,\r\nmany of the peculiar hillocks and hollows which characterize terminal\r\nmoraines may have arisen.\r\n\r\nSome of the depressions probably arose in another way. When the edge of\r\nthe ice retreated, considerable detached masses of ice might be left\r\nbeyond the main body. This might be buried by gravel and sand washed out\r\nfrom the moraine. On melting, the former sites of such blocks of ice\r\nwould be marked by \"kettles.\" In the marginal accumulations of drift as\r\nfirst deposited, considerable quantities of ice were doubtless left.\r\nWhen this melted, the drift settled and the unequal settling may have\r\ngiven rise to some of the topographic irregularities of the drift.\r\n\r\n_The terminal moraine about Devil's lake._--On the lower lands, the\r\nterminal moraine of the Devil's lake region has the features\r\ncharacteristic of terminal moraines in general. It is a belt of thick\r\ndrift varying in width from half a mile or less to three-quarters of a\r\nmile or more. Its surface is marked by numerous hills and short ridges,\r\nwith intervening depressions or \"kettles.\" Some of the depressions among\r\nthe hills contain water, making ponds or marshes, though the rather\r\nloose texture of the drift of this region is not favorable to the\r\nretention of water. The moraine belt, as a whole, is higher than the\r\nland on either side. It is therefore somewhat ridge-like, and the small,\r\nshort hills and ridges which mark its surface, are but constituent parts\r\nof the larger, broader ridge.\r\n\r\nApproached from the west, that is from the driftless side, the moraine\r\non the lower lands is a somewhat prominent topographic feature, often\r\nappearing as a ridge thirty, forty or even fifty feet in height.\r\nApproached from the opposite direction, that is, from the ground\r\nmoraine, it is notably less prominent, and its inner limit wherever\r\nlocated, is more or less arbitrary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.--Cut through the terminal moraine just east of\r\nKirkland, partially diagrammatic.]\r\n\r\nA deep, fresh railway cut in the moraine southeast of Devil's lake\r\nillustrates its complexity of structure, a complexity which is probably\r\nno greater than that at many other points where exposures are not seen.\r\nThe section is represented in Fig. 38. The stratified sand to the right\r\nretains even the ripple-marks which were developed when it was\r\ndeposited. To the left, at the same level, there is a body of _till_\r\n(unstratified drift), over which is a bed of stoneless and apparently\r\nstructureless clay. In a depression just above the clay with till both\r\nto the right and left, is a body of loam which possesses the\r\ncharacteristics of normal loess. It also contains calcareous\r\nconcretions, though no shells have been found. This occurrence of loess\r\nis the more noteworthy, since loess is rarely found in association with\r\ndrift of the last glacial epoch.[7]\r\n\r\n    [7] An account of loess in connection with the drift of the\r\n    last glacial epoch is given in the _Journal of Geology_, Vol.\r\n    IV, pp. 929-987. For a general account of loess, see Sixth\r\n    Annual Report of U.S. Geological Survey.\r\n\r\n_The moraine on the main quartzite range._--In tracing the moraine over\r\nthe greater quartzite range, it is found to possess a unique feature in\r\nthe form of a narrow but sharply defined ridge of drift, formed at the\r\nextreme margin of the ice at the time of its maximum advance. For fully\r\neleven miles, with but one decided break, and two short stretches where\r\nits development is not strong, this unique marginal ridge separates the\r\ndrift-covered country on the one hand, from the driftless area on the\r\nother. In its course the ridge lies now on slopes, and now on summits,\r\nbut in both situations preserves its identity. Where it rests on a\r\nplain, or nearly plain surface, its width at base varies from six to\r\nfifteen rods, and its average height is from twenty to thirty feet. Its\r\ncrest is narrow, often no more than a single rod. Where it lies on a\r\nslope, it is asymmetrical in cross section (see Fig. 39), the shorter\r\nslope having a vertical range of ten to thirty-five feet, and its longer\r\na range of forty to one hundred feet. This asymmetrical form persists\r\nthroughout all that portion of the ridge which lies on an inclined\r\nsurface, the slope of which does not correspond with the direction of\r\nthe moraine. Where it lies on a flat surface, or an inclined surface\r\nthe slope of which corresponds in direction with the course of the ridge\r\nitself, its cross section is more nearly symmetrical (see Fig. 40). In\r\nall essential characteristics this marginal ridge corresponds with the\r\n_End-Moraene_ of the Germans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.--Diagrammatic cross-section of the marginal\r\nridge as it occurs on the south slope of the Devil's Nose. The slope\r\nbelow, though glaciated, is nearly free from drift.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.--Diagrammatic cross-section of the marginal\r\nridge as it appears when its base is not a sloping surface.]\r\n\r\nFor the sake of bringing out some of its especially significant\r\nfeatures, the ridge may be traced in detail, commencing on the south\r\nside of the west range. Where the moraine leaves the lowlands south of\r\nthe Devil's nose, and begins the ascent of the prominence, the marginal\r\nridge first appears at about the 940-foot contour (f, Plate XXXVII).\r\nThough at first its development is not strong, few rods have been passed\r\nbefore its crest is fifteen to twenty feet above the driftless area\r\nimmediately to the north (see Fig. 39) and from forty to one hundred\r\nfeet above its base to the south, down the slope. In general the ridge\r\nbecomes more distinct with increasing elevation, and except for two or\r\nthree narrow post-glacial erosion breaks, is continuous to the very\r\nsummit at the end of the nose (g). The ridge in fact constitutes the\r\nuppermost forty or forty-five feet of the crest of the nose, which is\r\nthe highest point of the west range within the area shown on the map.\r\nThroughout the whole of this course the marginal ridge lies on the south\r\nslope of the nose, and has the asymmetrical cross section shown in Fig.\r\n39. Above (north of) the ridge at most points not a bowlder of drift\r\noccurs. So sharply is its outer (north) margin defined, that at many\r\npoints it is possible to locate it within the space of less than a yard.\r\n\r\nAt the crest of the nose (g) the marginal ridge, without a break,\r\nswings northward, and in less than a quarter of a mile turns again to\r\nthe west. Bearing to the north it presently reaches (at h) the edge of\r\nthe precipitous bluff, bordering the great valley at the south end of\r\nthe lake. Between the two arms of the loop thus formed, the surface of\r\nthe nose is so nearly level that it could have offered no notable\r\nopposition to the progress of the ice, and yet it failed to be covered\r\nby it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL.

In the bottom of the valley the moraine takes on\r\nits normal form, and the slopes of the quartzite ridges on either hand\r\nare much too steep to allow any body of drift, or loose material of any\r\nsort, to lodge on them.\r\n\r\nAscending the east bluff a little east of the point where the drift\r\nridge drops off the west bluff, the ridge is again found (at i) in\r\ncharacteristic development. For some distance it is located at the edge\r\nof the precipitous south face of the bluff. Farther on it bears to the\r\nnorth, and soon crosses a col (j) in the ridge, building it up many\r\nfeet above the level of the bed-rock. From this point eastward for about\r\nthree miles the marginal ridge is clearly defined, the slopes about\r\nequal on either side, and the crest as nearly even as the topography of\r\nthe underlying surface permits. The topographic relations in this part\r\nof the course are shown in Fig. 40.\r\n\r\nAt k, this marginal ridge attains its maximum elevation, 1,620 feet.\r\nAt this great elevation, the ridge turns sharply to the northwest at an\r\nangle of more than 90 deg.. Following this direction for little more than\r\nhalf a mile, it turns to the west. At some points in this vicinity the\r\nridge assumes the normal morainic habit, but this is true for short\r\ndistances only. Farther west, at l, it turns abruptly to the northeast\r\nand is sharply defined. It here loops about a narrow area less than\r\nsixty rods wide, and over half a mile in length, the sharpest loop in\r\nits whole course. The driftless tract enclosed by the arms of this loop\r\nis lower than the drift ridge on either hand. The ice on either side\r\nwould need to have advanced no more than thirty rods to have covered the\r\nwhole of it.\r\n\r\nFrom the minor loop just mentioned, the marginal ridge is continued\r\nwestward, being well developed for about a mile and a half. At this\r\npoint the moraine swings south to the north end of Devil's lake, loses\r\nthe unique marginal ridge which has characterized its outer edge\r\nacross the quartzite range for so many miles, and assumes the topography\r\nnormal to terminal moraines. At no other point in the United States, so\r\nfar as known to the writers, is there so sharply marked a marginal ridge\r\nassociated with the terminal moraine, for so long a distance.\r\n\r\nFrom Plate II it will be seen that the moraine as a whole makes a\r\ngreat loop to the eastward in crossing the quartzite range. From the\r\ndetailed description just given of the course of the marginal ridge, it\r\nwill be seen that it has three distinct loops; one on the Devil's nose\r\n(west of g, Plate XXXVII); one on the main ridge (west of k)\r\nand a minor one on the north side of the last (southwest of m). The\r\nfirst and third are but minor irregularities on the sides of the great\r\nloop, the head of which is at k.\r\n\r\nThe significant fact in connection with these irregularities in the\r\nmargin of the moraine is that each loop stands in a definite relation to\r\na prominence. The meaning of this relation is at once patent. The great\r\nquartzite range was a barrier to the advance of the ice. Acting as a\r\nwedge, it caused a re-entrant in the advancing margin of the glacier.\r\nThe extent and position of the re-entrant is shown by the course of the\r\nmoraine in Plate II. Thus the great loop in the moraine, the head of\r\nwhich is at k, Plate XXXVII, was caused by the quartzite range itself.\r\n\r\nThe minor loops on the sides of the major are to be explained on the\r\nsame principle. Northeast of the minor loop on the north side of the\r\nlarger one (m) there are two considerable hills, reaching an elevation\r\nof nearly 1,500 feet. Though the ice advancing from the east-northeast\r\noverrode them, they must have acted like a wedge, to divide it into\r\nlobes. The ice which reached their summits had spent its energy in so\r\ndoing, and was unable to move forward down the slope ahead, and the\r\nthicker bodies of ice which passed on either side of them, failed to\r\nunite in their lee (compare Figs. 34 and 35). The application of the\r\nsame principle to the loop on the Devil's nose is evident.\r\n\r\n_Constitution of the marginal ridge._--The material in the marginal\r\nridge, as seen where erosion has exposed it, is till, abnormal, if at\r\nall, only in the large percentage of widely transported bowlders which\r\nit contains. This is especially true of the surface, where in some\r\nplaces 90 per cent. of the large bowlders are of very distant origin,\r\nand that in spite of the fact that the ice which deposited them had just\r\nrisen up over a steep slope of quartzite, which could easily have\r\nyielded abundant bowlders. In other places the proportion of foreign\r\nbowlders is small, no more than one in ten. In general, however,\r\nbowlders of distant origin predominate over those derived close at hand.\r\n\r\n_The slope of the upper surface of the ice at the margin._--The marginal\r\nridge on the south slope of Devil's nose leads to an inference of\r\nespecial interest. Its course lies along the south slope of the nose,\r\nfrom its summit on the east to its base on the west. Throughout this\r\ncourse the ridge marks with exactness the position of the edge of the\r\nice at the time of its maximum advance, and its crest must therefore\r\nrepresent the slope of the upper surface of the ice at its margin.\r\n\r\nThe western end of the ridge (f, Plate XXXVII) has an altitude of 940\r\nfeet, and its eastern end (g) is just above the 1,500-foot contour.\r\nThe distance from the one point to the other is one and three-fourths\r\nmiles, and the difference in elevation, 560 feet. These figures show\r\nthat the slope of the ice along the south face of this bluff was about\r\n320 feet per mile. This, so far as known, is the first determination of\r\nthe slope of the edge of the continental ice sheet _at its extreme\r\nmargin_. It is to be especially noted that these figures are for the\r\nextreme edge of the ice only. The angle of slope back from the edge was\r\ndoubtless much less.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Stratified Drift._\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that glacier ice does not distinctly stratify the\r\ndeposits which it makes, it is still true that a very large part of the\r\ndrift for which the ice of the glacial period was directly or indirectly\r\nresponsible is stratified. That this should be so is not strange when it\r\nis remembered that most of the ice was ultimately converted into running\r\nwater, just as the glaciers of today are. The relatively small portion\r\nwhich disappeared by evaporation was probably more than counterbalanced,\r\nat least near the margin of the ice, by the rain which fell upon it.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be considered an exaggeration, therefore, to say that the\r\ntotal amount of water which operated on the drift, first and last, was\r\nhardly less than the total amount of the ice itself. The drift deposited\r\nby the marginal part of the ice was affected during its deposition, not\r\nonly by the water which arose from the melting of the ice which did the\r\ndepositing, but by much water which arose from the melting of the ice\r\nfar back from the margin. The general mobility of the water, as\r\ncontrasted with ice, allowed it to concentrate its activities along\r\nthose lines which favored its motion, so that different portions of the\r\ndrift were not affected equally by the water of the melting ice.\r\n\r\nAll in all it will be seen that the water must have been a very\r\nimportant factor in the deposition of the drift, especially near the\r\nmargin of the ice. But the ice sheet had a marginal belt throughout its\r\nwhole history, and water must have been active and effective along this\r\nbelt, not only during the decadence of the ice sheet, but during its\r\ngrowth as well. It is further to be noted that any region of drift stood\r\ngood chance of being operated upon by the water after the ice had\r\ndeparted from it, so that in regions over which topography directed\r\ndrainage after the withdrawal of the ice, the water had the last chance\r\nat the drift, and modified it in such a way and to such an extent as\r\ncircumstances permitted.\r\n\r\n_Its origin._--There are various ways in which stratified drift may\r\narise in connection with glacier deposits. It may come into existence by\r\nthe operation of water alone; or by the co-operation of ice and water.\r\nWhere water alone was immediately responsible for the deposition of\r\nstratified drift, the water concerned may have owed its origin to the\r\nmelting ice, or it may have existed independently of the ice in the form\r\nof lakes. When the source of the water was the melting ice, the water\r\nmay have been running, when it was actively concerned in the deposition\r\nof stratified drift; or it may have been standing (glacial lakes and\r\nponds), when it was passively concerned. When ice co-operated with water\r\nin the development of stratified drift the ice was generally a passive\r\npartner.\r\n\r\n_Glacial drainage._--The body of an ice sheet during any glacial period\r\nis probably melting more or less at some horizons all the time, and at\r\nall horizons some of the time. Most of the water which is produced at\r\nthe surface during the summer sinks beneath it. Some of it may congeal\r\nbefore it sinks far, but much of it reaches the bottom of the ice\r\nwithout refreezing. It is probable that melting is much more nearly\r\ncontinuous in the body of a moving ice sheet than at its surface, and\r\nthat some of the water thus produced sinks to the bottom of the ice\r\nwithout refreezing. At the base of the ice, so long as it is in\r\nmovement, there is doubtless more or less melting, due both to friction\r\nand to the heat received by conduction from the earth below. Thus in the\r\nice and under the ice there must have been more or less water in motion\r\nthroughout essentially all the history of an ice sheet.\r\n\r\nIf it be safe to base conclusions on the phenomena of existing glaciers,\r\nit may be assumed that the waters beneath the ice, and to a less extent\r\nthe waters in the ice, organized themselves to a greater or less degree\r\ninto streams. For longer or shorter distances these streams flowed in\r\nthe ice or beneath it. Ultimately they escaped from its edge. The\r\nsubglacial streams doubtless flowed, in part, in the valleys which\r\naffected the land surface beneath the ice, but they were probably not\r\nall in such positions.\r\n\r\nThe courses of well-defined subglacial streams were tunnels. The bases\r\nof the tunnels were of rock or drift, while the sides and tops were of\r\nice. It will be seen, therefore, that their courses need not have\r\ncorresponded with the courses of the valleys beneath the ice. They may\r\nsometimes have followed lines more or less independent of topography,\r\nmuch as water may be forced over elevations in closed tubes. It is not\r\nto be inferred, however, that the subglacial streams were altogether\r\nindependent of the sub-ice topography. The tunnels in which the water\r\nran probably had too many leaks to allow the water to be forced up over\r\ngreat elevations. This, at least, must have been the case where the ice\r\nwas thin or affected by crevasses. Under such circumstances the\r\ntopography of the land surface must have been the controlling element\r\nin determining the course of the subglacial drainage.\r\n\r\nWhen the streams issued from beneath the ice the conditions of flow were\r\nmore or less radically changed, and from their point of issue they\r\nfollowed the usual laws governing river flow. If the streams entered\r\nstatic water as they issued from the ice, and this was true where the\r\nice edge reached the sea or a lake, the static water modified the\r\nresults which the flowing waters would otherwise have produced.\r\n\r\n_Stages in the history of an ice sheet._--The history of an ice sheet\r\nwhich no longer exists involves at least two distinct stages. These are\r\n(1) the period of growth, and (2) the period of decadence. If the latter\r\ndoes not begin as soon as the former is complete, an intervening stage,\r\nrepresenting the period of maximum ice extension, must be recognized. In\r\nthe case of the ice sheets of the glacial period, each of these stages\r\nwas probably more or less complex. The general period of growth of each\r\nice sheet is believed to have been marked by temporary, but by more or\r\nless extensive intervals of decadence, while during the general period\r\nof decadence, it is probable that the ice was subject to temporary, but\r\nto more or less extensive intervals of recrudescence. For the sake of\r\nsimplicity, the effects of these oscillations of the edge of the ice\r\nwill be neglected at the outset, and the work of the water accompanying\r\nthe two or three principal stages of an ice sheet's history will be\r\noutlined as if interruptions in the advance and in the retreat,\r\nrespectively, had not occurred.\r\n\r\nAs they now exist, the deposits of stratified drift made at the edge of\r\nthe ice or beyond it during the period of its maximum extension present\r\nthe simplest, and at the same time most sharply defined phenomena, and\r\nare therefore considered first.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Deposits Made by Extraglacial Waters During the Maximum Extension of\r\n                           the Ice._\r\n\r\nThe deposits made by the water at the time of the maximum extension of\r\nthe ice and during its final retreat, were never disturbed by subsequent\r\nglacier action. So far as not destroyed by subsequent erosion, they\r\nstill retain the form and structure which they had at the outset. Such\r\ndrift deposits, because they lie at the surface, and because they are\r\nmore or less distinct topographically as well as structurally, are\r\nbetter known than the stratified drift of other stages of an ice sheet's\r\nhistory. Of stratified drift made during the maximum extension of the\r\nice, and during its final retreat, there are several types.\r\n\r\n_A. At the edge of ice, on land._--If the subglacial streams flowed\r\nunder \"head,\" the pressure was relieved when they escaped from the ice.\r\nWith this relief, there was diminution of velocity. With the diminution\r\nof velocity, deposition of load would be likely to take place. Since\r\nthese changes would be likely to occur at the immediate edge of the ice,\r\none class of stratified drift deposits would be made in this position,\r\nin immediate contact with the edge of the ice, and their form would be\r\ninfluenced by it. At the stationary margin of an ice sheet, therefore,\r\nat the time of its maximum advance, ice and water must have co-operated\r\nto bring into existence considerable quantities of stratified drift.\r\n\r\nThe edge of the ice was probably ragged, as the ends of glaciers are\r\ntoday, and as the waters issued from beneath it, they must frequently\r\nhave left considerable quantities of such debris as they were carrying,\r\nagainst its irregular margin, and in its re-entrant angles and marginal\r\ncrevasses. When the ice against which this debris was first lodged\r\nmelted, the marginal accumulations of gravel and sand often assumed the\r\nform of kames. A typical kame is a hill, hillock, or less commonly a\r\nshort ridge of stratified drift; but several or many are often\r\nassociated, giving rise to groups and areas of _kames_. Kames are often\r\nassociated with terminal moraines, a relation which emphasizes the fact\r\nof their marginal origin.\r\n\r\nSo far as the superficial streams which flowed to the edge of the ice\r\ncarried debris, this was subject to deposition as the streams descended\r\nfrom the ice. Such drift would tend to increase the body of marginal\r\nstratified drift from subglacial sources.\r\n\r\nMarginal accumulations of stratified drift, made by the co-operation of\r\nrunning water and ice, must have had their most extensive development,\r\nother things being equal, where the margin of the ice was longest in one\r\nposition, and where the streams were heavily loaded. The deposits made\r\nby water at the edge of the ice differ from those of the next\r\nclass--made beyond the edge of the ice--in that they were influenced in\r\ntheir disposition and present topography, by the presence of ice.\r\n\r\nIn the Devil's lake region isolated and well-defined kames are not of\r\ncommon occurrence. There are, however, at many points hills which have\r\nsomething of a kame-like character. There is such a hill a mile\r\nsoutheast of the Court house at Baraboo, at the point marked p, Plate\r\nXXXVII. In this hill there are good exposures which show its structure.\r\nThere are many hillocks of a general kame-like habit associated with the\r\nterminal moraine south of the main quartzite range, and north of the\r\nWisconsin river. Many of them occur somewhat within the terminal moraine\r\na few miles northwest of Merrimac.\r\n\r\n_B. Beyond the edge of the ice, on land._--As the waters escaping from\r\nthe ice flowed farther, deposits of stratified drift were made quite\r\nbeyond the edge of the ice. The forms assumed by such deposits are\r\nvarious, and depended on various conditions. Where the waters issuing\r\nfrom the edge of the ice found themselves concentrated in valleys, and\r\nwhere they possessed sufficient load, and not too great velocity, they\r\naggraded the valleys through which they flowed, developing fluvial\r\nplains of gravel and sand, which often extended far beyond the ice. Such\r\nfluvial plains of gravel and sand constitute the _valley trains_ which\r\nextend beyond the unstratified glacial drift in many of the valleys of\r\nthe United States. They are found especially in the valleys leading out\r\nfrom the stouter terminal moraines of late glacial age. From these\r\nmoraines, the more extensive valley trains take their origin, thus\r\nemphasizing the fact that they are deposits made by water beyond a\r\nstationary ice margin. Valley trains have all the characteristics of\r\nalluvial plains built by rapid waters carrying heavy loads of detritus.\r\nNow and then their surfaces present slight variations from planeness,\r\nbut they are minor. Like all plains of similar origin they decline\r\ngradually, and with diminishing gradient, down stream. They are of\r\ncoarser material near their sources, and of finer material farther away.\r\nValley trains constitute a distinct topographic as well as genetic type.\r\n\r\nA perfect example of a valley train does not occur within the region\r\nhere discussed. There is such a train starting at the moraine where it\r\ncrosses the Wisconsin river above Prairie du Sac, and extending down\r\nthat valley to the Mississippi, but at its head this valley train is\r\nwide and has the appearance of an overwash plain, rather than a valley\r\ntrain. Farther from the moraine, however, it narrows, and assumes the\r\nnormal characteristics of a valley train. It is the gravel and sand of\r\nthis formation which underlies Sauk Prairie, and its topographic\r\ncontinuation to the westward.\r\n\r\nWhere the subglacial streams did not follow subglacial valleys, they did\r\nnot always find valleys when they issued from the ice. Under such\r\ncircumstances, each heavily loaded stream coming out from beneath the\r\nice must have tended to develop a plain of stratified material near its\r\npoint of issue--a sort of alluvial fan. Where several such streams came\r\nout from beneath the ice near one another, their several plains, or\r\nfans, were likely to become continuous by lateral growth. Such border\r\nplains of stratified drift differ from valley trains particularly (1) in\r\nbeing much less elongate in the direction of drainage; (2) in being much\r\nmore extended parallel to the margin of the ice; and (3) in not being\r\nconfined to valleys. Such plains stood an especially good chance of\r\ndevelopment where the edge of the ice remained constant for a\r\nconsiderable period of time, for it was under such conditions that the\r\nissuing waters had opportunity to do much work. Thus arose the type of\r\nstratified drift variously known as _overwash plains_, _outwash plains_,\r\n_morainic plains_, and _morainic aprons_. These plains sometimes skirt\r\nthe moraine for many miles at a stretch.\r\n\r\nOverwash plains may sometimes depart from planeness by taking on some\r\nmeasure of undulation, of the sag and swell (kame) type, especially near\r\ntheir moraine edges. The same is often true of the heads of valley\r\ntrains. The heads of valley trains and the inner edges of overwash\r\nplains, it is to be noted, occupy the general position in which kames\r\nare likely to be formed, and the undulations which often affect these\r\nparts of the trains and plains, respectively, are probably to be\r\nattributed to the influence of the ice itself. Valley trains and\r\noverwash plains, therefore, at their upper ends and edges respectively,\r\nmay take on some of the features of kames. Indeed, either may head in a\r\nkame area.\r\n\r\nGood examples of overwash or outwash plains may be seen at various\r\npoints in the vicinity of Baraboo. The plain west of the moraine just\r\nsouth of the main quartzite ridge has been referred to under valley\r\ntrains. In Sauk Prairie, however, its characteristics are those of an\r\noutwash plain, rather than those of a valley train.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.--The morainic or outwash plain bordering the\r\nterminal moraine. The figure is diagrammatic, but represents, in cross\r\nsection, the normal relation as seen south of the quartzite range at the\r\neast edge of Sauk Prairie, north of the Baraboo river and at some points\r\nbetween the South range and the Baraboo.]\r\n\r\nA good example of an outwash plain occurs southwest of Baraboo, flanking\r\nthe moraine on the west (Fig. 41). Seen from the west, the moraine just\r\nnorth of the south quartzite range stands up as a conspicuous ridge\r\ntwenty to forty feet above the morainic plain which abuts against it.\r\nTraced northward, the edge of the outwash plain, as it abuts against\r\nthe moraine, becomes higher, and in Section 4, Township 11 N., Range 6\r\nE., the moraine edge of the plain reaches the crest of the moraine (Fig.\r\n42). From this point north to the Baraboo river the moraine scarcely\r\nrises above the edge of the outwash beyond.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.--The outwash plain is built up to the crest of\r\nthe moraine. The figure is diagrammatic, but this relation is seen at\r\nthe point marked W, Plate II.]\r\n\r\nNorth of the Baraboo river the moraine is again distinct and the\r\noverwash plain to the west well developed much of the way from the\r\nBaraboo to Kilbourn City. A portion of it is known as Webster's Prairie.\r\n\r\nLocally, the outwash plains of this region have been much dissected by\r\nerosion since their deposition, and are now affected by many small\r\nvalleys. In composition these plains are nearly everywhere gravel and\r\nsand, the coarser material being nearer the moraine. The loose material\r\nis in places covered by a layer of loam several feet deep, which greatly\r\nimproves the character of the soil. This is especially true of Sauk\r\nPrairie, one of the richest agricultural tracts in the state.\r\n\r\nWhen the waters issuing from the edge of the ice were sluggish, whether\r\nthey were in valleys or not, the materials which they carried and\r\ndeposited were fine instead of coarse, giving rise to deposits of silt,\r\nor clay, instead of sand or gravel.\r\n\r\nAt many points near the edge of the ice during its maximum stage of\r\nadvance, there probably issued small quantities of water not in the form\r\nof well-defined streams, bearing small quantities of detritus. These\r\nsmall quantities of water, with their correspondingly small loads, were\r\nunable to develop considerable plains of stratified drift, but produced\r\nsmall patches instead. Such patches have received no special\r\ndesignation.\r\n\r\nIn the deposition of stratified drift beyond the edge of the ice, the\r\nlatter was concerned only in so far as its activity helped to supply the\r\nwater with the necessary materials.\r\n\r\n_C. Deposits at and beyond the edge of the ice in standing water._--The\r\nwaters which issued from the edge of the ice sometimes met a different\r\nfate. The ice in its advance often moved up river valleys. When at the\r\ntime of its maximum extension, it filled the lower part of a valley,\r\nleaving the upper part free, drainage through the valley stood good\r\nchance of being blocked. Where this happened a marginal valley lake was\r\nformed. Such a lake was formed in the valley of the Baraboo when the\r\nedge of the ice lay where the moraine now is (Plate II). The waters\r\nwhich were held back by the ice dam, reinforced by the drainage from the\r\nice itself, soon developed a lake above the point of obstruction. This\r\nextinct lake may be named Baraboo lake. In this lake deposits of\r\nlaminated clay were made. They are now exposed in the brick yards west\r\nof Baraboo, and in occasional gullies and road cuts in the flat\r\nbordering the river.\r\n\r\nAt the point marked s (Plate XXXVII) there was, in glacial\r\ntimes, a small lake having an origin somewhat different from that of\r\nBaraboo lake. The former site of the lake is now marked by\r\na notable flat. Excavations in the flat show that it is made up of\r\nstratified clay, silt, sand and gravel, to the depth of many\r\nfeet,--locally more than sixty. These lacustrine deposits are well\r\nexposed in the road cuts near the northwest corner of the flat, and in\r\nwashes at some other points. Plate XXXVIII shows some of the silt and\r\nclay, the laminae of which are much distorted.\r\n\r\n_Deltas_ must have been formed where well-defined streams entered the\r\nlakes, and _subaqueous overwash plains_ where deltas became continuous\r\nby lateral growth. The accumulation of stratified drift along the\r\nice-ward shores of such lakes must have been rapid, because of the\r\nabundant supply of detritus. These materials were probably shifted about\r\nmore or less by waves and shore currents, and some of them may have been\r\nwidely distributed. Out from the borders of such lakes, fine silts and\r\nclays must have been in process of deposition, at the same time that the\r\ncoarse materials were being laid down nearer shore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WISCONSIN GEOL. AND NAT. HIST. SURVEY. BULLETIN NO. V.,\r\nPL. XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nDistorted laminae of silt and clay.]\r\n\r\nGood examples of deltas and subaqueous overwash plains do not appear to\r\nexist in the region, although conditions for their development seem to\r\nhave been present. Thus in the lake which occupied the valley of the\r\nBaraboo, conditions would seem to have been ideal for the development of\r\nsuch features; that is, the overwash plains previously described should,\r\ntheoretically, have been subaqueous overwash plains; but if this be\r\ntheir character, their distinctive marks have been destroyed by\r\nsubsequent erosion.\r\n\r\nDuring the maximum extension of an ice sheet, therefore, there was\r\nchance for the development, at its edge or beyond it, of the following\r\ntypes of stratified drift: (1) kames and kame belts, at the edge of the\r\nice; (2) fluvial plains or valley trains, in virtual contact with the\r\nice at their heads; (3) border plains or overwash plains, in virtual\r\ncontact with the ice at their upper edges; (4) ill-defined patches of\r\nstratified drift, coarse or fine near the ice; (5) subaqueous overwash\r\nplains and deltas, formed either in the sea or lakes at or near the edge\r\nof the ice; (6) lacustrine and marine deposits of other sorts, the\r\nmaterials for which were furnished by the waters arising from the ice.\r\nSo far as this region is concerned, all the deposits made in standing\r\nwater were made in lakes.\r\n\r\n_Deposits Made by Extraglacial Waters During the Retreat of the Ice._\r\n\r\nDuring the retreat of any ice sheet, disregarding oscillations of its\r\nedge, its margin withdrew step by step from the position of extreme\r\nadvance to its center. When the process of dissolution was complete,\r\neach portion of the territory once covered by the ice, had at some stage\r\nin the dissolution, found itself in a marginal position. At all stages\r\nin its retreat the waters issuing from the edge of the ice were working\r\nin the manner already outlined in the preceding paragraphs. Two points\r\nof difference only need be especially noted. In the first place the\r\ndeposits made by waters issuing from the retreating ice were laid down\r\non territory which the ice had occupied, and their subjacent stratum was\r\noften glacial drift. So far as this was the case, the stratified drift\r\nwas super-morainic, not extra-morainic. In the second place the edge of\r\nthe ice in retreat did not give rise to such sharply marked formations\r\nas the edge of the ice which was stationary. The processes which had\r\ngiven rise to valley trains, overwash plains, kames, etc., while the ice\r\nedge was stationary, were still in operation, but the line or zone of\r\ntheir activity (the edge of the ice) was continually retreating, so that\r\nthe foregoing types, more or less dependent on a stationary edge, were\r\nrarely well developed. As the ice withdrew, therefore, it allowed to be\r\nspread over the surface it had earlier occupied, many incipient valley\r\ntrains, overwash plains, and kames, and a multitude of ill-defined\r\npatches of stratified drift, thick and thin, coarse and fine. Wherever\r\nthe ice halted in its retreat, these various types stood chance of\r\nbetter development.\r\n\r\nSuch deposits did not cover all the surface discovered by the ice in its\r\nretreat, since the issuing waters, thanks to their great mobility,\r\nconcentrated their activities along those lines which favored their\r\nmotion. Nevertheless the aggregate area of the deposits made by water\r\noutside the ice as it retreated, was great.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that it was not streams alone which were operative as\r\nthe ice retreated. As its edge withdrew, lakes and ponds were\r\ncontinually being drained, as their outlets, hitherto choked by the ice,\r\nwere opened, while others were coming into existence as the depressions\r\nin the surface just freed from ice, filled with water. Lacustrine\r\ndeposits at the edge of the ice during its retreat were in all essential\r\nrespects identical with those made in similar situations during its\r\nmaximum extension.\r\n\r\nDisregarding oscillations of the ice edge at these stages, the deposits\r\nmade by extraglacial waters during the maximum extension of an ice\r\nsheet, and during its retreat, were always left at the surface, so far\r\nas the work of that ice sheet was concerned. The stratified drift laid\r\ndown by extraglacial waters in these stages of the last ice sheet which\r\naffected any region of our continent still remain at the surface in much\r\nthe condition in which they were deposited, except for the erosion they\r\nhave since suffered. It is because of their position at the surface that\r\nthe deposits referable to these stages of the last ice sheet of any\r\ngiven region have received most attention and are therefore most\r\nfamiliar.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Deposits Made by Extraglacial Waters During the Advance of the Ice._\r\n\r\nDuring the advance of an ice sheet, if its edge forged steadily forward,\r\nthe waters issuing from it, and flowing beyond, were effecting similar\r\nresults. They were starting valley trains, overwash plains, kames, and\r\nsmall ill-defined patches of stratified drift which the ice did not\r\nallow them to complete before pushing over them, thus moving forward the\r\nzone of activity of extraglacial waters. Unlike the deposits made by the\r\nwaters of the retreating ice, those made by the waters of the advancing\r\nstage were laid down on territory which had not been glaciated, or at\r\nleast not by the ice sheet concerned in their deposition. If the ice\r\nhalted in its advance, there was at such time and place opportunity for\r\nthe better development of extraglacial stratified drift.\r\n\r\nLakes as well as streams were concerned in the making of stratified beds\r\nof drift, during the advance of the ice. Marginal lakes were obliterated\r\nby having their basins filled with the advancing ice, which displaced\r\nthe water. But new ones were formed, on the whole, as rapidly as their\r\npredecessors became extinct, so that lacustrine deposits were making at\r\nintervals along the margin of the advancing ice.\r\n\r\nDeposits made in advance of a growing ice sheet, by waters issuing from\r\nit, were subsequently overridden by the ice, to the limit of its\r\nadvance, and in the process, suffered destruction, modification, or\r\nburial, in whole or in part, so that now they rarely appear at the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n\r\n              _Deposits Made by Subglacial Streams._\r\n\r\nBefore their issuance from beneath the ice, subglacial waters were not\r\nidle. Their activity was sometimes erosive, and at such times stratified\r\ndeposits were not made. But where the sub-glacial streams found\r\nthemselves overloaded, as seems frequently to have been the case, they\r\nmade deposits along their lines of flow. Where such waters were not\r\nconfined to definite channels, their deposits probably took on the form\r\nof irregular patches of silt, sand, or gravel; but where depositing\r\nstreams were confined to definite channels, their deposits were\r\ncorrespondingly concentrated.\r\n\r\nWhen subglacial streams were confined to definite channels, the same may\r\nhave been constant in position, or may have shifted more or less from\r\nside to side. Where the latter happened there was a tendency to the\r\ndevelopment of a belt or strip of stratified drift having a width equal\r\nto the extent of the lateral migrations of the under-ice stream. Where\r\nthe channel of the subglacial stream remained fixed in position, the\r\ndeposition was more concentrated, and the bed was built up. If the\r\nstream held its course for a long period of time, the measure of\r\nbuilding may have been considerable. In so far as these channel deposits\r\nwere made near the edge of the ice, during the time of its maximum\r\nextension or retreat, they were likely to remain undisturbed during its\r\nmelting. The aggraded channels then came to stand out as ridges. These\r\nridges of gravel and sand are known as osars or eskers. It is not to\r\nbe inferred that eskers never originated in other ways, but it seems\r\nclear that this is one method, and probably the principal one, by which\r\nthey came into existence. Eskers early attracted attention, partly\r\nbecause they are relatively rare, and partly because they are often\r\nrather striking topographic features. The essential conditions,\r\ntherefore, for their formations, so far as they are the product of\r\nsubglacial drainage, are (1) the confining of the subglacial streams to\r\ndefinite channels; and (2) a sufficient supply of detritus. One esker\r\nonly has been found in the region under consideration. It is located at\r\nthe point marked j, Plate II, seven and one-half miles northeast of\r\nMerrimac and one and one-half miles south of Alloa (g, Plate II). The\r\nesker is fully a quarter of a mile long, about thirty feet high, and\r\nfour rods wide at its base.\r\n\r\nSubglacial deposits of stratified drift were sometimes made on\r\nunstratified drift (till) already deposited by the ice before the\r\nlocation of the stream, and sometimes on the rock surfaces on which no\r\ncovering of glacier drift had been spread.\r\n\r\nIt is to be kept in mind that subglacial drainage was operative during\r\nthe advance of an ice sheet, during its maximum extension, and during\r\nits retreat, and that during all these stages it was effecting its\r\nappropriate results. It will be readily seen, however, that all deposits\r\nmade by subglacial waters, were subject to modification or destruction\r\nor burial, through the agency of the ice, and that those made during the\r\nadvance of the ice were less likely to escape than those made during its\r\nmaximum extension or retreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n           RELATIONS OF STRATIFIED TO UNSTRATIFIED DRIFT.\r\n\r\nWhen it is remembered that extraglacial and subglacial waters were\r\nactive at all stages of an ice sheet's history, giving rise, or tending\r\nto give rise to all the phases of stratified drift enumerated above;\r\nwhen it is remembered that the ice of several epochs affected much of\r\nthe drift-covered country; and when it is remembered further that the\r\nedge of the ice both during advance and retreat was subject to\r\noscillation, and that each advance was likely to bury the stratified\r\ndrift last deposited, beneath unstratified, it will be seen that the\r\nstratified drift and the unstratified had abundant opportunity to be\r\nassociated in all relationships and in all degrees of intimacy, and that\r\nthe relations of the one class of drift to the other may come to be very\r\ncomplex.\r\n\r\nAs a result of edge oscillation, it is evident that stratified drift may\r\nalternate with unstratified many times in a formation of drift\r\ndeposited during a single ice epoch, and that two beds of till,\r\nseparated by a bed of stratified drift, do not necessarily represent two\r\ndistinct glacial epochs. The extent of individual beds of stratified\r\ndrift, either beneath the till or inter-bedded with it, may not be\r\ngreat, though their aggregate area and their aggregate volume is very\r\nconsiderable. It is to be borne in mind that the ice, in many places,\r\ndoubtless destroyed all the stratified drift deposited in advance on the\r\nterritory which it occupied later, and that in others it may have left\r\nonly patches of once extensive sheets. This may help to explain why it\r\nso frequently happens that a section of drift at one point shows many\r\nlayers of stratified drift, while another section close by, of equal\r\ndepth, and in similar relationships, shows no stratified material\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\nSuch deposits as were made by superglacial streams during the advance of\r\nthe ice must likewise have been delivered on the land surface, but would\r\nhave been subsequently destroyed or buried, becoming in the latter case,\r\nsubmorainic. This would be likely to be the fate of all such\r\nsuperglacial gravels as reached the edge of the ice up to the time of\r\nits maximum advance.\r\n\r\nStreams descending from the surface of the ice into crevasses also must\r\nhave carried down sand and gravel where such materials existed on the\r\nice. These deposits may have been made on the rock which underlies the\r\ndrift, or they may have been made on stratified or unstratified drift\r\nalready deposited. In either case they were liable to be covered by\r\ntill, thus reaching an inter-till or sub-till position.\r\n\r\nEnglacial streams probably do little depositing, but it is altogether\r\nconceivable that they might accumulate such trivial pockets of sand and\r\ngravel as are found not infrequently in the midst of till. The\r\ninter-till position would be the result of subsequent burial after the\r\nstratified material reached a resting place.\r\n\r\nComplexity of relations.--From the foregoing it becomes clear that\r\nthere are diverse ways by which stratified drift, arising in connection\r\nwith an ice sheet, may come to be interbedded with till, when due\r\nrecognition is made of all the halts and oscillations to which the edge\r\nof a continental glacier may have been subject during both its advance\r\nand retreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n     CLASSIFICATION OF STRATIFIED DRIFT ON THE BASIS OF POSITION.\r\n\r\nIn general the conditions and relations which theoretically should\r\nprevail are those which are actually found.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of position stratified drift deposits may be classified as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. Extraglacial deposits, made by the waters of any glacial epoch if\r\nthey flowed and deposited beyond the farthest limit of the ice.\r\n\r\n2. Supermorainic deposits, made chiefly during the final retreat of\r\nthe ice from the locality where they occur, but sometimes by\r\nextraglacial streams or lakes of a much later time. Locally too,\r\nstratified deposits of an early stage of a glacial epoch, lying on till,\r\nmay have failed to be buried by the subsequent passage of the ice over\r\nthem, and so remain at the surface. In origin, supermorainic deposits\r\nwere for the most part extraglacial (including marginal), so far as the\r\nice sheet calling them into existence was concerned. Less commonly they\r\nwere subglacial, and failed to be covered, and less commonly still\r\nsuperglacial.\r\n\r\n3. The submorainic (basal) deposits were made chiefly by extraglacial\r\nwaters in advance of the first ice which affected the region where they\r\noccur. They were subsequently overridden by the ice and buried by its\r\ndeposits. Submorainic deposits, however, may have arisen in other ways.\r\nSubglacial waters may have made deposits of stratified drift on surfaces\r\nwhich had been covered by ice, but not by till, and such deposits may\r\nhave been subsequently buried. The retreat of an ice sheet may have left\r\nrock surfaces free from till covering, on which the marginal waters of\r\nthe ice may have made deposits of stratified drift. These may have been\r\nsubsequently covered by till during a re-advance of the ice in the same\r\nepoch or in a succeeding one. Still again, the till left by one ice\r\nsheet may have been exposed to erosion to such an extent as to have been\r\ncompletely worn away before the next ice advance, so that stratified\r\ndeposits connected with a second or later advance may have been made on\r\na driftless surface, and subsequently buried.\r\n\r\n4. Intermorainic stratified drift may have originated at the outset in\r\nall the ways in which supermorainic drift may originate. It may have\r\nbecome intermorainic by being buried in any one of the various ways in\r\nwhich the stratified drift may become submorainic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            CHANGES IN DRAINAGE EFFECTED BY THE ICE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _While the Ice Was on._\r\n\r\nAs the continental ice sheet invaded a region, the valleys were filled\r\nand drainage was thereby seriously disturbed. Different streams were\r\naffected in different ways. Where the entire basin of a stream was\r\ncovered by ice, the streams of that basin were, for the time being,\r\nobliterated. Where the valley of a stream was partially filled with ice,\r\nthe valley depression was only partially obliterated, and the remaining\r\nportion became the scene of various activities. Where the ice covered\r\nthe lower course of a stream but not the upper, the ice blocked the\r\ndrainage, giving rise to a lake. Where the ice covered the upper course\r\nof a stream, but not its lower, the lower portion was flooded, and\r\nthough the river held its position, it assumed a new phase of activity.\r\nStreams issuing from the ice usually carry great quantities of gravel\r\nand sand, and make deposits along their lower courses. Long continued\r\nglacial drainage usually results in a large measure of aggradation. This\r\nwas true of the streams of the glacial period.\r\n\r\nWhere a stream flowed parallel or approximately parallel to the edge of\r\nthe advancing ice it was sometimes shifted in the direction in which the\r\nice was moving, keeping parallel to the front of the ice. All of these\r\nclasses of changes took place in this region.\r\n\r\n_Wisconsin lake._--Reference has already been made to certain lakes\r\nwhich existed in the region when the ice was there. The largest of these\r\nlakes was that which resulted from the blocking of the Wisconsin river.\r\nThe ice crossed its present course at Kilbourn City, and its edge lay to\r\nthe west of the river from that point to Prairie du Sac (see Plate I).\r\nThe waters from the area now draining into the Wisconsin must either\r\nhave found an avenue of escape beneath the ice, or have accumulated in a\r\nlake west of the edge of the ice. There is reason to believe that the\r\nlatter was what happened, and that a great lake covered much of the low\r\nland west of the Wisconsin river above and below Kilbourn City. The\r\nextensive gravel beds on the north flank of the quartzite bluff at\r\nNecedah, and the water-worn pebbles of local origin on the slope of\r\nPetenwell peak (Plate XXXII), as well as the gravels at other points,\r\nare presumably the work of that lake. The waters in this lake, as in\r\nthat in the Baraboo valley, probably rose until the lowest point in the\r\nrim of the basin was reached, and there they had their outlet. The\r\nposition of this outlet has not been definitely determined, but it has\r\nbeen thought to be over the divide of the Black river.[8] It is\r\npossible, so far as now known, that this lake was connected with that of\r\nthe Baraboo valley. Until topographic maps of this region are made, the\r\nconnections will not be easily determined.\r\n\r\n    [8] Chamberlin: Geology of Wisconsin, Vol. 1.\r\n\r\nEven after the ice had retreated past the Wisconsin, opening up the\r\npresent line of drainage, the lakes did not disappear at once, for the\r\nice had left considerable deposits of drift in the Wisconsin valley.\r\nThus at F, Plates II and XXXVII, and perhaps at other points, the\r\nWisconsin has made cuts of considerable depth in the drift. Were these\r\ncuts filled, as they must have been when the ice melted, the drainage\r\nwould be ponded, the waters standing at the level of the dam. This drift\r\nobstruction at F would therefore have prolonged the history of the lake\r\nwhich had come into existence when the ice blocked the drainage of the\r\nWisconsin. As the drift of the valley was removed the level of the lake\r\nsank and finally disappeared.\r\n\r\n_Baraboo lake._--Another lake which existed in this region when the ice\r\nwas here, occupied the valley of the Baraboo and its tributaries when\r\nthe ice blocked the valley at Baraboo. This lake occupied not only the\r\nvalley of the Baraboo, but extended up the lower course of every\r\ntributary, presumably rising until it found the lowest point in the rim\r\nof the drainage basin. The location of this point, and therefore the\r\nheight of the lake when at its maximum, are not certainly known, though\r\nmeager data on this point have been collected. At a point three miles\r\nsoutheast of Ablemans on the surface of a sandstone slope, water-worn\r\ngravel occurs, the pebbles of which were derived from the local rock. On\r\nthe slope below the gravel, the surface is covered with loam which has a\r\nsuggestion of stratification, while above it, the soil and subsoil\r\nappear to be the product of local rock decomposition. This water-worn\r\ngravel of local origin on a steep slope facing the valley, probably\r\nrepresents the work of the waves of this lake, perhaps when it stood at\r\nits maximum height. This gravel is about 125 feet (aneroid measurement)\r\nabove the Baraboo river to the north.\r\n\r\nFurther evidence of a shore line has been found at the point marked T,\r\nPlate II. At this place water-worn gravel of the local rock occurs in\r\nmuch the same relationship as that already mentioned, and at the same\r\nelevation above the Baraboo river. At a point two and one-half miles\r\nsouthwest of Ablemans there is local water-worn gravel, with which is\r\nmingled glacial material (pieces of porphyry and diabase) which could\r\nhave reached this point only by being carried thither by floating ice\r\nfrom the glacier. The level of this mixed local and glacial material is\r\n(according to aneroid measurement) approximately the same as that of the\r\nother localities.\r\n\r\nWhen the ice melted, an outlet was opened _via_ the Lower narrows, and\r\nthe water of the lake drained off to the Wisconsin by this route. Had\r\nthe ice left no drift, the lake would have been promptly drained when\r\nthe ice melted; but the lake did not entirely disappear immediately\r\nafter the ice retreated, for the drift which the ice left obstructed\r\ndrainage to the east. The moraine, however, was not so high as the\r\noutlet of the lake while the ice was on, so that, as the ice retreated,\r\nthe water flowed over the moraine to the east, and drew down the level\r\nof the lake to the level of the lowest point in the moraine. The\r\npostglacial cut through the moraine is about ninety feet deep.\r\n\r\nBesides being obstructed where crossed by the terminal moraine, the\r\nvalley of the Baraboo was clogged to a less extent by drift deposits\r\nbetween the moraine and the Lower narrows. At one or two places near the\r\nCity of Baraboo, such obstructions, now removed, appear to have existed.\r\nJust above the Lower narrows (c, Plate XXXVII) there is positive\r\nevidence that the valley was choked with drift. Here in subsequent time,\r\nthe river has cut through the drift-filling of the preglacial valley,\r\ndeveloping a passage about twenty rods wide and thirty-five feet deep.\r\nIf this passage were filled with drift, reproducing the surface left by\r\nthe ice, the broad valley above it would be flooded, producing a shallow\r\nlake.\r\n\r\nThe retreat of the ice therefore left two well defined drift dams in the\r\nvalley, one low one just above the Lower narrows, and a higher one, the\r\nmoraine dam, just west of Baraboo. Disregarding the influence of the\r\nice, and considering the Baraboo valley only, these two dams would have\r\ngiven rise to two lakes, the upper one behind the higher dam being\r\ndeeper and broader, and covering a much larger area; the lower one\r\nbehind the lower dam, being both small and shallow.\r\n\r\nUp to the time that the ice retreated past the Lower narrows, the waters\r\nof the upper and lower lakes were united, held up to a common level by\r\nthe ice which blocked this pass. After the ice retreated past the Lower\r\nnarrows, the level of the Baraboo lake did not sink promptly, for not\r\nuntil the ice had retreated past the site of the Wisconsin was the\r\npresent drainage established. Meantime the waters of the Baraboo lake\r\njoined those of Wisconsin lake through the Lower narrows. If\r\nthe lakes had been before connected at some point farther west, this\r\nconnection through the narrows would not have changed the level of\r\neither. If they were not before connected, and if the Wisconsin lake was\r\nlower than the Baraboo, this connection would have drawn down the level\r\nof the latter.\r\n\r\nSince the drainage from the Baraboo went to the Wisconsin, the Baraboo\r\nlake was not at first lowered below the level of the highest obstruction\r\nin the valley of the Wisconsin even after the ice had retreated beyond\r\nthat stream. As the drift obstructions of the Wisconsin valley were\r\nlowered, the levels of all the lakes above were correspondingly brought\r\ndown. When the level of the waters in these lakes was brought down to\r\nthe level of the moraine dam above Baraboo, the one Baraboo lake of\r\nearlier times became two. The level of the upper of these two lakes was\r\ndetermined by the moraine above Baraboo, that of the lower by the\r\nhighest obstruction below the moraine in either the Baraboo or Wisconsin\r\nvalley. The drift obstructions in the Baraboo valley were probably\r\nremoved about as fast as those in the Wisconsin, and since the\r\nobstructions were of drift, and the streams strong, the removal of the\r\ndams was probably rapid. Both the upper and lower Baraboo lakes, as well\r\nas the Wisconsin, had probably been reduced to small proportions, if not\r\nbeen completely drained, before the glacial period was at an end.\r\n\r\n_Devil's lake in glacial times._--While the ice edge was stationary in\r\nits position of maximum advance, its position on the north side of the\r\nmain quartzite range was just north of Devil's lake (Plate XXXVII). The\r\nhigh ridge of drift a few rods north of the shore is a well defined\r\nmoraine, and is here more clearly marked than farther east or west,\r\nbecause it stands between lower lands on either side, instead of being\r\nbanked against the quartzite ridge. North of the lake it rises about 75\r\nfeet above the water. When the ice edge lay in this position on the\r\nnorth side of the range, its front between the East bluff and the\r\nDevil's nose lay a half mile or so from the south end of the lake. In\r\nthis position also there is a well defined moraine.\r\n\r\nWhile the ice was at its maximum stand, it rose above these moraine\r\nridges at either end of the lake. Between the ice at these two points\r\nthere was then a notable basin, comparable to that of the present lake\r\nexcept that the barriers to the north and southeast were higher than\r\nnow. The melting of the ice supplied abundant water, and the lake rose\r\nabove its present level. The height which it attained is not known, but\r\nit is known to have risen at least 90 feet above its present level. This\r\nis indicated by the presence of a few drift bowlders on the West bluff\r\nof the lake at this height. They represent the work of a berg or bergs\r\nwhich at some stage floated out into the lake with bowlders attached.\r\nBowlders dropped by bergs might be dropped at any level lower than the\r\nhighest stand of the lake.\r\n\r\n_Other lakes._--Another glacial lake on the East quartzite bluff has\r\nalready been referred to. Like the Devil's lake in glacial\r\ntime, its basin was an enclosure between the ice on the one hand, and\r\nthe quartzite ridge on the other. The location of this lake is shown on\r\nPlate XXXVII (s). Here the edge of the ice, as shown by the position\r\nof the moraine, was affected by a re-entrant curve, the two ends of\r\nwhich rested against the quartzite ridge. Between the ice on the one\r\nhand and the quartzite ridge on the other, a small lake was formed. Its\r\nposition is marked by a notable flat.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the north side, and a narrow opening at the\r\nnorthwest corner, the flat is surrounded by high lands. When the ice\r\noccupied the region, its edge held the position shown by the line\r\nmarking the limit of its advance, and constituted an ice barrier to the\r\nnorth.[9] The area of the flat was, therefore, almost shut in, the only\r\noutlet being a narrow one at t, Plate XXXVII. If the filling of\r\nstratified drift which underlies the flat were removed, the bottom of\r\nthe area would be much lower than at present, and much lower than the\r\noutlet at t. It is therefore evident that when the ice had taken its\r\nposition along the north side of the flat, an enclosed basin must have\r\nexisted, properly situated for receiving and holding water. Since this\r\nlake had but a short life and became extinct before the ice retreated,\r\nits history is here given.\r\n\r\n    [9] The moraine line on the map represents the crest of the\r\n    marginal ridge rather than its outer limit, which is slightly\r\n    nearer the lake margin. Stratified drift of the nature of\r\n    overwash also intervenes at points between the moraine and\r\n    the lake border.\r\n\r\nAt first the lake had no outlet and the water rose to the level of the\r\nlowest point (t) in the rim of the basin, and thence overflowed to the\r\nwest. Meanwhile the sediments borne in by the glacial drainage were\r\nbeing deposited in the lake in the form of a subaqueous overwash plain,\r\nthe coarser parts being left near the shore, while the finer were\r\ncarried further out. Continued drainage from the ice continued to bring\r\nsediment into the lake, and the subaqueous overwash plain extended its\r\ndelta-like front farther and farther into the lake, until its basin was\r\ncompletely filled. With the filling of the basin the lake became\r\nextinct. The later drainage from the ice followed the line of the\r\noutlet, the level of which corresponds with the level of the filled lake\r\nbasin. This little extinct lake is of interest as an example of a\r\nglacial lake which became extinct by having its basin filled during\r\nglacial times, by sediments washed out from the ice.\r\n\r\nNear the northwest corner of this flat, an exposure in the sediments of\r\nthe old lake bed shows the curiously contorted layers of sand, silt, and\r\nclay represented in Plate XXXVIII. The layers shown in the\r\nfigure are but a few feet below the level of the flat which marks the\r\nsite of the lake. It will be seen that the contorted layers are between\r\ntwo series of horizontal ones. The material throughout the section is\r\nmade up of fine-grained sands and clays, well assorted. That these\r\nparticular layers should have been so much disturbed, while those below\r\nand above remained horizontal, is strange enough. The grounding of an\r\niceberg on the surface before the overlying layers were deposited, the\r\naction of lake ice, or the effect of expansion and contraction due to\r\nfreezing and thawing, may have been responsible for the singular\r\nphenomenon. Contorted laminae are rather characteristic of the deposits\r\nof stratified drift.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _After the Ice Had Disappeared._\r\n\r\nAs has already been indicated, the irregular deposition of\r\nglacial drift gave rise to many depressions without outlets in which\r\nsurface waters collected after the ice had disappeared, forming ponds or\r\nlakes. So abundant are lakes and ponds and marshes in recently glaciated\r\nregions and so rare elsewhere, that they constitute one of the more\r\neasily recognized characteristics of a glaciated region.\r\n\r\nAfter the ice had melted, the mantle of drift which it left was\r\nsometimes so disposed as to completely obliterate preglacial valleys.\r\nMore commonly it filled preglacial valleys at certain points only. In\r\nstill other cases a valley was not filled completely at any point,\r\nthough partially at many. In this last case, the partial fillings at\r\nvarious points constituted dams above which drainage was ponded, making\r\nlakes. If the dams were not high enough to throw the drainage out of the\r\nvalley, the lakes would have their outlets over them. The drift dam\r\nbeing unconsolidated would be quickly cut down by the outflowing water,\r\nand the lake level lowered. When the dam was removed or cut to its base,\r\nthe lake disappeared and drainage followed its preglacial course.\r\n\r\nIn case the valley was completely filled, or completely filled at\r\npoints, the case was very different. The drainage on the drift surface\r\nwas established with reference to the topography which obtained when the\r\nice departed, and not with reference to the preglacial valleys. Wherever\r\nthe preglacial valleys were completely filled, the postglacial drainage\r\nfollowed lines which were altogether independent of them. When\r\npreglacial valleys were filled by the drift in spots only, the\r\npostglacial streams followed them where they were not filled, only to\r\nleave them where the blocking occurred. In the former case the present\r\ndrainage is through valleys which are preglacial in some places, and\r\npostglacial in others.\r\n\r\nThus the drainage changes effected by the drift after the ice was gone,\r\nconcerned both lakes and rivers. In this region there are several\r\nillustrations of these changes.\r\n\r\n_Lakes._--The lake basins of drift-covered regions are of various types.\r\nSome of them are altogether in drift, some partly in drift and partly in\r\nrock, and some wholly in rock. Basins in the drift were likely to be\r\ndeveloped whenever heavy deposits surrounded thin ones. They are\r\nespecially common in the depressions of terminal moraines.\r\n\r\nAnother class of lake basins occurs in valleys, the basins being partly\r\nrock and partly drift. If a thick deposit of drift be made at one point\r\nin a valley, while above there is little or none, the thick deposit will\r\nform a dam, above which waters may accumulate, forming a pond or lake.\r\nAgain, a ridge of drift may be deposited in the form of a curve with its\r\nends against a rock-ridge, thus giving rise to a basin.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time, the lakes and ponds in the depressions made or\r\noccasioned by the drift will be destroyed by drainage. Remembering how\r\nvalleys develop it is readily understood that the heads of the\r\nvalleys will sooner or later find the lakes, and drain them if their\r\nbottoms be not too low.\r\n\r\nDrainage is hostile to lakes in another way. Every stream which flows\r\ninto a lake brings in more or less sediment. In the standing water this\r\nsediment is deposited, thus tending to fill the lake basin. Both by\r\nfilling their basins and by lowering their outlets, rivers tend to the\r\ndestruction of lakes, and given time enough, they will accomplish this\r\nresult. In view of this double hostility of streams, it is not too much\r\nto say that \"rivers are the mortal enemies of lakes.\"\r\n\r\nThe destruction of lakes by streams is commonly a gradual process, and\r\nso it comes about that the abundance and the condition of the undrained\r\nareas in a drift-covered region is in some sense an index of the length\r\nof time, reckoned in terms of erosion, which has elapsed since the drift\r\nwas deposited.\r\n\r\nIn this region there were few lakes which lasted long after the ice\r\ndisappeared. The basins of the Baraboo and Wisconsin lakes were\r\npartly of ice, and so soon as the ice disappeared, the basins were so\r\nnearly destroyed, and the drift dams that remained so easily eroded,\r\nthat the lakes had but a brief history,--a history that was glacial,\r\nrather than postglacial.\r\n\r\nThe history of the little lake on the East quartzite bluff as\r\nalready pointed out, came to an end while the ice was still present.\r\n\r\nThe beds of at least two other extinct ponds or small lakes above the\r\nlevel of the Baraboo are known. These are at v and w, Plate XXXVII.\r\nThey owed their origin to depressions in the drift, but the outflowing\r\nwaters have lowered their outlets sufficiently to bring them to the\r\ncondition of marshes. Both were small in area and neither was deep.\r\n\r\n_Existing lakes._--Relatively few lakes now remain in this immediate\r\nregion, though they are common in most of the country covered by the ice\r\nsheet which overspread this region. Devil's lake only is well known. The\r\nlake which stood in this position while the ice was on, has already been\r\nreferred to. After the ice had melted away, the drift which it\r\nhad deposited still left an enclosure suitable for holding water. The\r\nhistory of this basin calls for special mention.\r\n\r\nAt the north end of the lake, and again in the capacious valley leading\r\neast from its south end, there are massive terminal moraines. Followed\r\nsouthward, this valley though blocked by the moraine a half mile below\r\nthe lake, leads off towards the Wisconsin river, and is probably the\r\ncourse of a large preglacial stream. Beyond the moraine, this valley is\r\noccupied by a small tributary to the Wisconsin which heads at the\r\nmoraine. To the north of the lake, the head of a tributary of the\r\nBaraboo comes within eighty rods of the lake, but again the terminal\r\nmoraine intervenes. From data derived from wells it is known that the\r\ndrift both at the north and south ends of the lake extends many feet\r\nbelow the level of its water, and at the north end, the base of the\r\ndrift is known to be at least fifty feet below the level of the bottom\r\nof the lake. The draining of Devil's lake to the Baraboo river is\r\ntherefore prevented only by the drift dam at its northern end. It is\r\nnearly certain also, that, were the moraine dam at the south end of the\r\nlake removed, all the water would flow out to the Wisconsin, though the\r\ndata for the demonstration of this conclusion are not to be had, as\r\nalready stated.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the gorge between the East and West bluffs\r\nwas originally the work of a pre-Cambrian stream, though the depth of\r\nthe pre-Cambrian valley may not have been so great as that of the\r\npresent. Later, the valley, so far as then excavated, was filled with\r\nthe Cambrian (Potsdam) sandstone, and re-excavated in post-Cambrian and\r\npreglacial time. Devil's lake then occupies an unfilled portion of an\r\nold river valley, isolated by great morainic dams from its surface\r\ncontinuations on either hand. Between the dams, water has accumulated\r\nand formed the lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Changes in Streams._\r\n\r\nIn almost every region covered by the ice, the streams which established\r\nthemselves after its departure follow more or less anomalous courses.\r\nThis region is no exception. Illustrations of changes which the\r\ndeposition of the drift effected have already been given in one\r\nconnection or another in this report.\r\n\r\n_Skillett creek._--An illustration of the sort of change which drift\r\neffects is furnished by Skillett creek, a small stream tributary to the\r\nBaraboo, southwest of the city of that name. For some distance from its\r\nhead (a to b, Fig. 43) its course is through a capacious preglacial\r\nvalley. The lower part of this valley was filled with the water-laid\r\ndrift of the overwash plain. On reaching the overwash plain the creek\r\ntherefore shifted its course so as to follow the border of that plain,\r\nand along this route, irrespective of material, it has cut a new channel\r\nto the Baraboo. The postglacial portion of the valley (b to c) is\r\neverywhere narrow, and especially so where cut in sandstone.\r\n\r\nThe course and relations of this stream suggest the following\r\nexplanation: Before the ice came into the region, Skillett creek\r\nprobably flowed in a general northeasterly direction to the Baraboo,\r\nthrough a valley comparable in size to the preglacial part of the\r\npresent valley. As the ice advanced, the lower part of this valley was\r\noccupied by it, and the creek was compelled to seek a new course. The\r\nonly course open to it was to the north, just west of the advancing ice,\r\nand, shifting westward as fast as the ice advanced, it abandoned\r\n\r\naltogether its former lower course. Drainage from the ice then carried\r\nout and deposited beyond the same, great quantities of gravel and sand,\r\nmaking the overwash plain. This forced the stream still farther west,\r\nuntil it finally reached its present position across a sandstone ridge\r\nor plain, much higher than its former course. Into this sandstone it has\r\nsince cut a notable gorge, a good illustration of a postglacial valley.\r\nThe series of changes shown by this creek is illustrative of the changes\r\nundergone by streams in similar situations and relations all along the\r\nmargin of the ice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.--Skillett Creek, illustrating the points\r\nmentioned in the text.]\r\n\r\nThe picturesque glens (Parfrey's and Dorward's) on the south face of the\r\nEast bluff are the work of post-glacial streams. The preglacial valleys\r\nof this slope were obliterated by being filled during the glacial epoch.\r\n\r\n_The Wisconsin._--The preglacial course of the Wisconsin river is not\r\nknown in detail, but it was certainly different from the course which\r\nthe stream now follows. On Plate I the relations of the present stream\r\nto the moraine (and former ice-front) may be seen.[10] As the ice\r\napproached it from the east, the preglacial valley within the area here\r\nunder consideration was affected first by the overwash from the moraine,\r\nand later by the ice itself, from the latitude of Kilbourn City to\r\nPrairie du Sac.\r\n\r\n    [10] The preglacial course was probably east of the present\r\n    in the vicinity of Kilbourn City.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that the ice probably dammed the river, and\r\nthat a lake was formed above Kilbourn City, reaching east to the ice and\r\nwest over the lowland tributary to the river, the water rising till it\r\nfound an outlet, perhaps down to the Black river valley.\r\n\r\nWhen the ice retreated, the old valley had been partly filled, and the\r\nlowest line of drainage did not everywhere correspond with it. Where the\r\nstream follows its old course, it flows through a wide capacious valley,\r\nbut where it was displaced, it found a new course on the broad flat\r\nwhich bordered its preglacial course. Displacement of the stream\r\noccurred in the vicinity of Kilbourn City, and, forced to find a new\r\nline of flow west of its former course, the stream has cut a new channel\r\nin the sandstone. To this displacement of the river, and its subsequent\r\ncutting, we are indebted for the far-famed Dalles of the Wisconsin.\r\nBut not all the present route of the river through the dalles has\r\nbeen followed throughout the entire postglacial history of the stream.\r\nIn Fig. 44, the depression A, B, C, was formerly the course of the\r\nstream. The present course between D and E is therefore the youngest\r\nportion of the valley, and from its lesser width is known as the\r\n\"narrows.\" During high water in the spring, the river still sends part\r\nof its waters southward by the older and longer route.\r\n\r\nThe preglacial course of the Wisconsin south of the dalles has never\r\nbeen determined with certainty, but rational conjectures as to its\r\nposition have been made.\r\n\r\nThe great gap in the main quartzite range, a part of which is occupied\r\nby Devil's lake, was a narrows in a preglacial valley. The only streams\r\nin the region sufficiently large to be thought of as competent to\r\nproduce such a gorge are the Baraboo and the Wisconsin. If the Baraboo\r\nwas the stream which flowed through this gorge in preglacial time, the\r\ncomparable narrows in the north quartzite range--the Lower narrows of\r\nthe Baraboo--is to be accounted for. The stream which occupied one of\r\nthese gorges probably occupied the other, for they are in every way\r\ncomparable except in that one has been modified by glacial action, while\r\nthe other has not.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.--The Wisconsin valley near Kilbourn City.]\r\n\r\nThe Baraboo river flows through a gorge--the Upper narrows--in the north\r\nquartzite range at Ablemans, nine miles west of Baraboo. This gorge is\r\nmuch narrower than either the Lower narrows or the Devil's lake gorge,\r\nsuggesting the work of a lesser stream. It seems on the whole\r\nprobable, as suggested by Irving,[11] that in preglacial time the\r\nWisconsin river flowed south through what is now the Lower narrows of\r\nthe Baraboo, thence through the Devil's lake gorge to its present valley\r\nto the south. If this be true, the Baraboo must at that time have joined\r\nthis larger stream at some point east of the city of the same name.\r\n\r\n    [11] Irving. Geology of Wisconsin, Vol. II.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _The Driftless Area._\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the fact that the western part of the\r\narea here described is driftless, and the line marking the limit of ice\r\nadvance has been defined. Beyond this line, gravel and sand, carried\r\nbeyond the ice by water, extends some distance to the west. But a large\r\narea in the southwestern part of the state is essentially free from\r\ndrift, though it is crossed by two belts of valley drift (valley trains)\r\nalong the Wisconsin and Mississippi rivers.\r\n\r\nThe \"driftless area\" includes, besides the southwestern portion of\r\nWisconsin, the adjoining corners of Minnesota, Iowa and Illinois. In the\r\nearlier epochs of the glacial period this area was completely surrounded\r\nby the ice, but in the last or Wisconsin epoch it was not surrounded,\r\nsince the lobes did not come together south of it as in earlier times.\r\n(Compare Plate XXXIII and Fig. 36.)\r\n\r\nVarious suggestions have been made in the attempt to explain the\r\ndriftless area. The following is perhaps the most satisfactory:[12]\r\n\r\n    [12] Chamberlin and Irving. Geology of Wisconsin, Vols. I and\r\n    II.\r\n\r\nThe adjacent highlands of the upper peninsula of Michigan, are bordered\r\non the north by the capacious valley of Lake Superior leading off to the\r\nwest, while to the east lies the valley of Lake Michigan leading to the\r\nsouth. These lake valleys were presumably not so broad and deep in\r\npreglacial times as now, though perhaps even then considerable valleys.\r\n\r\nWhen the ice sheet, moving in a general southward direction from the\r\nCanadian territory, reached these valleys, they led off two great\r\ntongues or lobes of ice, the one to the south through the Lake Michigan\r\ndepression, the other to the south of west through the Lake Superior\r\ntrough. (Fig. 36.) The highland between the lake valleys conspired with\r\nthe valleys to the same end. It acted as a wedge, diverting the ice to\r\neither side. It offered such resistance to the ice, that the thin and\r\nrelatively feeble sheet which succeeded in surmounting it, did not\r\nadvance far to the south before it was exhausted. On the other hand, the\r\nice following the valleys of Lakes Superior and Michigan respectively,\r\nfailed to come together south of the highland until the latitude of\r\nnorthern Iowa and Illinois was reached. The driftless area therefore\r\nlies south of the highlands, beyond the limit of the ice which\r\nsurmounted it, and between the Superior and Michigan glacial lobes above\r\ntheir point of union. The great depressions, together with the\r\nintervening highland, are therefore believed to be responsible for the\r\nabsence of glaciation in the driftless area.\r\n\r\n\r\n        _Contrast Between Glaciated and Unglaciated Areas._\r\n\r\nThe glaciated and unglaciated areas differ notably in (1) topography, (2)\r\ndrainage, and (3) mantle rock.\r\n\r\n1. _Topography._--The driftless area has long been exposed to the\r\nprocesses of degradation. It has been cut into valleys and ridges by\r\nstreams, and the ridges have been dissected into hills. The\r\ncharacteristic features of a topography fashioned by running water are\r\nsuch as to mark it clearly from surfaces fashioned by other agencies.\r\nRivers end at the sea (or in lakes). Generally speaking, every point at\r\nthe bottom of a river valley is higher than any other point in the\r\nbottom of the same valley nearer the sea, and lower than any other point\r\ncorrespondingly situated farther from the sea. This follows from the\r\nfact that rivers make their own valleys for the most part, and a river's\r\ncourse is necessarily downward. In a region of erosion topography\r\ntherefore, tributary valleys lead down to their mains, secondary\r\ntributaries lead down to the first, and so on; or, to state the same\r\nthing in reverse order, in every region where the surface configuration\r\nhas been determined by rain and river erosion, every gully and every\r\nravine descends to a valley. The smaller valleys descend to larger and\r\nlower ones, which in turn lead to those still larger and lower. The\r\nlowest valley of a system ends at the sea, so that the valley which\r\njoins the sea is the last member of the series of erosion channels of\r\nwhich the ravines and gullies are the first. It will thus be seen that\r\nall depressions in the surface, worn by rivers, lead to lower ones. The\r\nsurface of a region sculptured by rivers is therefore marked by valleys,\r\nwith intervening ridges and hills, the slopes of which descend to them.\r\nAll topographic features are here determined by the water courses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.--Drainage in the driftless area. The absence of\r\nponds and marshes is to be noted.]\r\n\r\nThe relief features of the glaciated area, on the other hand, lack the\r\nsystematic arrangement of those of the unglaciated territory, and stream\r\nvalleys are not the controlling elements in the topography.\r\n\r\n2. _Drainage._--The surface of the driftless area is well drained. Ponds\r\nand lakes are essentially absent, except where streams have been\r\nobstructed by human agency. The drainage of the drift-covered area, on\r\nthe other hand, is usually imperfect. Marshes, ponds and lakes are of\r\ncommon occurrence. These types are shown by the accompanying maps, Figs.\r\n45 and 46, the one from the driftless area, the other from the\r\ndrift-covered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.--Drainage in a glaciated region. Walworth and\r\nWaukesha counties, Wisconsin, showing abundance of marshes and lakes.]\r\n\r\n3. _Mantle rock._--The unglaciated surface is overspread to an average\r\ndepth of several feet by a mantle of soil and earth which has resulted\r\nfrom the decomposition of the underlying rock. This earthy material\r\nsometimes contains fragments and even large masses of rock like that\r\nbeneath. These fragments and masses escaped disintegration because of\r\ntheir greater resistance while the surrounding rock was destroyed. This\r\nmantle rock grades from fine material at the surface down through\r\ncoarser, until the solid rock is reached, the upper surface of the rock\r\nbeing often ill-defined (Fig. 47). The thickness of the mantle is\r\napproximately constant in like topographic situations where the\r\nunderlying rock is uniform.\r\n\r\nThe residual soils are made up chiefly of the insoluble parts of the\r\nrock from which they are derived, the soluble parts having been removed\r\nin the process of disintegration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.--Section in a driftless area, showing relation\r\nof the mantle rock to the solid rock beneath.]\r\n\r\nWith these residuary soils of the driftless area, the mantle rock of\r\nglaciated tracts is in sharp contrast. Here, as already pointed out, the\r\nmaterial is diverse, having come from various formations and from widely\r\nseparated sources. It contains the soluble as well as the insoluble\r\nparts of the rock from which it was derived. In it there is no\r\nsuggestion of uniformity in thickness, no regular gradation from fine to\r\ncoarse from the surface downward. The average thickness of the drift is\r\nalso much greater than that of the residual earths. Further, the contact\r\nbetween the drift and the underlying rock surface is usually a definite\r\nsurface. (Compare Figs. 32 and 47.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                       POSTGLACIAL CHANGES.\r\n\r\nSince the ice melted from the region, the changes in its geography have\r\nbeen slight. Small lakes and ponds have been drained, the streams whose\r\nvalleys had been partly filled, have been re-excavating them, and\r\nerosion has been going on at all points in the slow way in which it\r\nnormally proceeds. The most striking example of postglacial erosion is\r\nthe dalles of the Wisconsin, and even this is but a small gorge for so\r\nlarge a stream. The slight amount of erosion which has been accomplished\r\nsince the drift was deposited, indicates that the last retreat of the\r\nice, measured in terms of geology and geography, was very recent. It has\r\nbeen estimated at 7,000 to 10,000 years, though too great confidence is\r\nnot to be placed in this, or any other numerical estimate of\r\npost-glacial time.\r\n\r\n\r\n
