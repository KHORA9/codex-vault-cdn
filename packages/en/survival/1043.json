The living scene of our time is lit by the\r\nlight of the sun, and for every few rays that enter the human eye, and\r\nconvey the image of it to the human mind, great floods of the reflected\r\nlight pour out, swiftly and indefinitely, into space. Imagine, then,\r\na man moving out into space more rapidly than light, his face turned\r\ntoward the earth. Flashing through the void at, let us say, a million\r\nmiles a second, he would (if we can overlook the dispersion of the\r\nrays of light) overtake in succession the light that fell on the French\r\nRevolution, the Reformation, the Norman Conquest, and the faces of the\r\nancient empires. He would read, in reverse order, the living history of\r\nman and whatever lay before the coming of man.\r\n\r\nFew thought, as they smiled over this fairy tale of science, that\r\nsome such panoramic survey of the story of the earth, and even of the\r\nheavens, might one day be made in a leisure hour by ordinary mortals;\r\nthat in the soil on which they trod were surer records of the past than\r\nin its doubtful literary remains, and in the deeper rocks were records\r\nthat dimly lit a vast abyss of time of which they never dreamed. It\r\nis the supreme achievement of modern science to have discovered and\r\ndeciphered these records. The picture of the past which they afford is,\r\non the whole, an outline sketch. Here and there the details, the colour,\r\nthe light and shade, may be added; but the greater part of the canvas is\r\nleft to the more skilful hand of a future generation, and even the\r\nbroad lines are at times uncertain. Yet each age would know how far its\r\nscientific men have advanced in constructing that picture of the growth\r\nof the heavens and the earth, and the aim of the present volume is to\r\ngive, in clear and plain language, as full an account of the story as\r\nthe present condition of our knowledge and the limits of the volume will\r\nallow. The author has been for many years interested in the evolution\r\nof things, or the way in which suns and atoms, fishes and flowers, hills\r\nand elephants, even man and his institutions, came to be what they\r\nare. Lecturing and writing on one or other phase of the subject have,\r\nmoreover, taught him a language which the inexpert seem to understand,\r\nalthough he is not content merely to give a superficial description of\r\nthe past inhabitants of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe particular features which, it is hoped, may give the book a\r\ndistinctive place in the large literature of evolution are, first, that\r\nit includes the many evolutionary discoveries of the last few years,\r\ngathers its material from the score of sciences which confine themselves\r\nto separate aspects of the universe, and blends all these facts and\r\ndiscoveries in a more or less continuous chronicle of the life of the\r\nheavens and the earth. Then the author has endeavoured to show, not\r\nmerely how, but why, scene succeeds scene in the chronicle of the earth,\r\nand life slowly climbs from level to level. He has taken nature in the\r\npast as we find it to-day: an interconnected whole, in which the changes\r\nof land and sea, of heat and cold, of swamp and hill, are faithfully\r\nreflected in the forms of its living population. And, finally, he has\r\nwritten for those who are not students of science, or whose knowledge\r\nmay be confined to one branch of science, and used a plain speech which\r\nassumes no previous knowledge on the reader's part.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, it will be found that no strained effort is made to trace\r\npedigrees of animals and plants when the material is scanty; that, if on\r\naccount of some especial interest disputable or conjectural speculations\r\nare admitted, they are frankly described as such; and that the more\r\nimportant differences of opinion which actually divide astronomers,\r\ngeologists, biologists, and anthropologists are carefully taken into\r\naccount and briefly explained. A few English and American works are\r\nrecommended for the convenience of those who would study particular\r\nchapters more closely, but it has seemed useless, in such a work,\r\nto give a bibliography of the hundreds of English, American, French,\r\nGerman, and Italian works which have been consulted.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n     I.

THE DISCOVERY OF THE UNIVERSE\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the victorious career of modern science was very\r\nlargely due to the making of two stimulating discoveries at the close\r\nof the Middle Ages. One was the discovery of the earth: the other the\r\ndiscovery of the universe. Men were confined, like molluscs in their\r\nshells, by a belief that they occupied the centre of a comparatively\r\nsmall disk--some ventured to say a globe--which was poised in a\r\nmysterious way in the middle of a small system of heavenly bodies. The\r\ngeneral feeling was that these heavenly bodies were lamps hung on a not\r\ntoo remote ceiling for the purpose of lighting their ways. Then certain\r\nenterprising sailors--Vasco da Gama, Maghalaes, Columbus--brought home\r\nthe news that the known world was only one side of an enormous globe,\r\nand that there were vast lands and great peoples thousands of miles\r\nacross the ocean. The minds of men in Europe had hardly strained\r\ntheir shells sufficiently to embrace this larger earth when the second\r\ndiscovery was reported. The roof of the world, with its useful little\r\nsystem of heavenly bodies, began to crack and disclose a profound\r\nand mysterious universe surrounding them on every side. One cannot\r\nunderstand the solidity of the modern doctrine of the formation of the\r\nheavens and the earth until one appreciates this revolution.\r\n\r\nBefore the law of gravitation had been discovered it was almost\r\nimpossible to regard the universe as other than a small and compact\r\nsystem. We shall see that a few daring minds pierced the veil, and\r\npeered out wonderingly into the real universe beyond, but for the\r\ngreat mass of men it was quite impossible. To them the modern idea of\r\na universe consisting of hundreds of millions of bodies, each weighing\r\nbillions of tons, strewn over billions of miles of space, would have\r\nseemed the dream of a child or a savage. Material bodies were \"heavy,\"\r\nand would \"fall down\" if they were not supported. The universe, they\r\nsaid, was a sensible scientific structure; things were supported in\r\ntheir respective places. A great dome, of some unknown but compact\r\nmaterial, spanned the earth, and sustained the heavenly bodies. It might\r\nrest on the distant mountains, or be borne on the shoulders of an Atlas;\r\nor the whole cosmic scheme might be laid on the back of a gigantic\r\nelephant, and--if you pressed--the elephant might stand on the hard\r\nshell of a tortoise. But you were not encouraged to press.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the vault had come from Babylon, the first home of science.\r\nNo furnaces thickened that clear atmosphere, and the heavy-robed priests\r\nat the summit of each of the seven-staged temples were astronomers.\r\nNight by night for thousands of years they watched the stars and\r\nplanets tracing their undeviating paths across the sky. To explain their\r\nmovements the priest-astronomers invented the solid firmament. Beyond\r\nthe known land, encircling it, was the sea, and beyond the sea was a\r\nrange of high mountains, forming another girdle round the earth. On\r\nthese mountains the dome of the heavens rested, much as the dome of\r\nSt. Paul's rests on its lofty masonry. The sun travelled across its\r\nunder-surface by day, and went back to the east during the night through\r\na tunnel in the lower portion of the vault. To the common folk the\r\npriests explained that this framework of the world was the body of an\r\nancient and disreputable goddess. The god of light had slit her in two,\r\n\"as you do a dried fish,\" they said, and made the plain of the earth\r\nwith one half and the blue arch of the heavens with the other.\r\n\r\nSo Chaldaea lived out its 5000 years without discovering the universe.\r\nEgypt adopted the idea from more scientific Babylon. Amongst the\r\nfragments of its civilisation we find representations of the firmament\r\nas a goddess, arching over the earth on her hands and feet, condemned to\r\nthat eternal posture by some victorious god. The idea spread amongst the\r\nsmaller nations which were lit by the civilisation of Babylon and Egypt.\r\nSome blended it with coarse old legends; some, like the Persians and\r\nHebrews, refined it. The Persians made fire a purer and lighter spirit,\r\nso that the stars would need no support. But everywhere the blue vault\r\nhemmed in the world and the ideas of men. It was so close, some said,\r\nthat the birds could reach it. At last the genius of Greece brooded over\r\nthe whole chaos of cosmical speculations.\r\n\r\nThe native tradition of Greece was a little more helpful than the\r\nBabylonian teaching. First was chaos; then the heavier matter sank to\r\nthe bottom, forming the disk of the earth, with the ocean poured round\r\nit, and the less coarse matter floated as an atmosphere above it,\r\nand the still finer matter formed an \"aether\" above the atmosphere.\r\nA remarkably good guess, in its very broad outline; but the solid\r\nfirmament still arched the earth, and the stars were little undying\r\nfires in the vault. The earth itself was small and flat. It stretched\r\n(on the modern map) from about Gibraltar to the Caspian, and from\r\nCentral Germany--where the entrance to the lower world was located--to\r\nthe Atlas mountains. But all the varied and conflicting culture of the\r\nolder empires was now passing into Greece, lighting up in succession the\r\ncivilisations of Asia Minor, the Greek islands, and then Athens and its\r\nsister states. Men began to think.\r\n\r\nThe first genius to have a glimpse of the truth seems to have been\r\nthe grave and mystical Pythagorus (born about 582 B.C.). He taught his\r\nlittle school that the earth was a globe, not a disk, and that it turned\r\non its axis in twenty-four hours. The earth and the other planets\r\nwere revolving round the central fire of the system; but the sun was a\r\nreflection of this central fire, not the fire itself. Even Pythagoras,\r\nmoreover, made the heavens a solid sphere revolving, with its stars,\r\nround the central fire; and the truth he discovered was mingled with so\r\nmuch mysticism, and confined to so small and retired a school, that it\r\nwas quickly lost again. In the next generation Anaxagoras taught that\r\nthe sun was a vast globe of white-hot iron, and that the stars were\r\nmaterial bodies made white-hot by friction with the ether. A generation\r\nlater the famous Democritus came nearer than any to the truth. The\r\nuniverse was composed of an infinite number of indestructible particles,\r\ncalled \"atoms,\" which had gradually settled from a state of chaotic\r\nconfusion to their present orderly arrangement in large masses. The sun\r\nwas a body of enormous size, and the points of light in the Milky Way\r\nwere similar suns at a tremendous distance from the earth. Our universe,\r\nmoreover, was only one of an infinite number of universes, and an\r\neternal cycle of destruction and re-formation was running through these\r\nmyriads of worlds.\r\n\r\nBy sheer speculation Greece was well on the way of discovery. Then the\r\nmists of philosophy fell between the mind of Greece and nature, and\r\nthe notions of Democritus were rejected with disdain; and then, very\r\nspeedily, the decay of the brilliant nation put an end to its feverish\r\nsearch for truth. Greek culture passed to Alexandria, where it met the\r\nremains of the culture of Egypt, Babylonia, and Persia, and one more\r\nremarkable effort was made to penetrate the outlying universe before the\r\nnight of the Middle Ages fell on the old world.\r\n\r\nAstronomy was ardently studied at Alexandria, and was fortunately\r\ncombined with an assiduous study of mathematics. Aristarchus (about\r\n320-250 B.C.) calculated that the sun was 84,000,000 miles away; a vast\r\nexpansion of the solar system and, for the time, a remarkable approach\r\nto the real figure (92,000,000) Eratosthenes (276-196 B.C.) made an\r\nextremely good calculation of the size of the earth, though he held it\r\nto be the centre of a small universe. He concluded that it was a globe\r\nmeasuring 27,000 (instead of 23,700) miles in circumference. Posidonius\r\n(135-51 B.C.) came even nearer with a calculation that the circumference\r\nwas between 25,000 and 19,000 miles; and he made a fairly correct\r\nestimate of the diameter, and therefore distance, of the sun. Hipparchus\r\n(190-120 B.C.) made an extremely good calculation of the distance of the\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nBy the brilliant work of the Alexandrian astronomers the old world\r\nseemed to be approaching the discovery of the universe. Men were\r\nbeginning to think in millions, to gaze boldly into deep abysses of\r\nspace, to talk of vast fiery globes that made the earth insignificant\r\nBut the splendid energy gradually failed, and the long line was closed\r\nby Ptolemaeus, who once more put the earth in the centre of the system,\r\nand so imposed what is called the Ptolemaic system on Europe. The keen\r\nschool-life of Alexandria still ran on, and there might have been a\r\nreturn to the saner early doctrines, but at last Alexandrian culture was\r\nextinguished in the blood of the aged Hypatia, and the night fell.\r\nRome had had no genius for science; though Lucretius gave an immortal\r\nexpression to the views of Democritus and Epicurus, and such writers\r\nas Cicero and Pliny did great service to a later age in preserving\r\nfragments of the older discoveries. The curtains were once more drawn\r\nabout the earth. The glimpses which adventurous Greeks had obtained of\r\nthe great outlying universe were forgotten for a thousand years. The\r\nearth became again the little platform in the centre of a little world,\r\non which men and women played their little parts, preening themselves on\r\ntheir superiority to their pagan ancestors.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to tell the familiar story of the revival at any\r\nlength. As far as the present subject is concerned, it was literally\r\na Renascence, or re-birth, of Greek ideas. Constantinople having been\r\ntaken by the Turks (1453), hundreds of Greek scholars, with their old\r\nliterature, sought refuge in Europe, and the vigorous brain of the young\r\nnations brooded over the ancient speculations, just as the vigorous\r\nyoung brain of Greece had done two thousand years before. Copernicus\r\n(1473-1543) acknowledges that he found the secret of the movements\r\nof the heavenly bodies in the speculations of the old Greek thinkers.\r\nGalilei (1564-1642) enlarged the Copernican system with the aid of the\r\ntelescope; and the telescope was an outcome of the new study of optics\r\nwhich had been inspired in Roger Bacon and other medieval scholars by\r\nthe optical works, directly founded on the Greek, of the Spanish Moors.\r\nGiordano Bruno still further enlarged the system; he pictured the\r\nuniverse boldly as an infinite ocean of liquid ether, in which the\r\nstars, with retinues of inhabited planets, floated majestically. Bruno\r\nwas burned at the stake (1600); but the curtains that had so long been\r\ndrawn about the earth were now torn aside for ever, and men looked\r\ninquiringly into the unfathomable depths beyond. Descartes (1596-1650)\r\nrevived the old Greek idea of a gradual evolution of the heavens and the\r\nearth from a primitive chaos of particles, taught that the stars stood\r\nout at unimaginable distances in the ocean of ether, and imagined the\r\nether as stirring in gigantic whirlpools, which bore cosmic bodies in\r\ntheir orbits as the eddy in the river causes the cork to revolve.\r\n\r\nThese stimulating conjectures made a deep impression on the new age.\r\nA series of great astronomers had meantime been patiently and\r\nscientifically laying the foundations of our knowledge. Kepler\r\n(1571-1630) formulated the laws of the movement of the planets; Newton\r\n(1642-1727) crowned the earlier work with his discovery of the real\r\nagency that sustains cosmic bodies in their relative positions. The\r\nprimitive notion of a material frame and the confining dome of the\r\nancients were abandoned. We know now that a framework of the most\r\nmassive steel would be too frail to hold together even the moon and the\r\nearth. It would be rent by the strain. The action of gravitation is the\r\nall-sustaining power. Once introduce that idea, and the great ocean of\r\nether might stretch illimitably on every side, and the vastest bodies\r\nmight be scattered over it and traverse it in stupendous paths. Thus it\r\ncame about that, as the little optic tube of Galilei slowly developed\r\ninto the giant telescope of Herschel, and then into the powerful\r\nrefracting telescopes of the United States of our time; as the new\r\nscience of photography provided observers with a new eye--a sensitive\r\nplate that will register messages, which the human eye cannot detect,\r\nfrom far-off regions; and as a new instrument, the spectroscope, endowed\r\nastronomers with a power of perceiving fresh aspects of the inhabitants\r\nof space, the horizon rolled backward, and the mind contemplated a\r\nuniverse of colossal extent and power.\r\n\r\nLet us try to conceive this universe before we study its evolution. I\r\ndo not adopt any of the numerous devices that have been invented for the\r\npurpose of impressing on the imagination the large figures we must\r\nuse. One may doubt if any of them are effective, and they are at least\r\nfamiliar. Our solar system--the family of sun and planets which had been\r\nsheltered under a mighty dome resting on the hill-tops--has turned out\r\nto occupy a span of space some 16,000,000,000 miles in diameter. That is\r\na very small area in the new universe. Draw a circle, 100 billion miles\r\nin diameter, round the sun, and you will find that it contains only\r\nthree stars besides the sun. In other words, a sphere of space measuring\r\n300 billion miles in circumference--we will not venture upon the number\r\nof cubic miles--contains only four stars (the sun, alpha Centauri,\r\n21,185 Lalande, and 61 Cygni). However, this part of space seems to be\r\nbelow the average in point of population, and we must adopt a different\r\nway of estimating the magnitude of the universe from the number of its\r\nstellar citizens.\r\n\r\nBeyond the vast sphere of comparatively empty space immediately\r\nsurrounding our sun lies the stellar universe into which our great\r\ntelescopes are steadily penetrating. Recent astronomers give various\r\ncalculations, ranging from 200,000,000 to 2,000,000,000, of the number\r\nof stars that have yet come within our faintest knowledge. Let us accept\r\nthe modest provisional estimate of 500,000,000. Now, if we had reason to\r\nthink that these stars were of much the same size and brilliance as our\r\nsun, we should be able roughly to calculate their distance from their\r\nfaintness. We cannot do this, as they differ considerably in size and\r\nintrinsic brilliance. Sirius is more than twice the size of our sun and\r\ngives out twenty times as much light. Canopus emits 20,000 times as much\r\nlight as the sun, but we cannot say, in this case, how much larger it is\r\nthan the sun. Arcturus, however, belongs to the same class of stars as\r\nour sun, and astronomers conclude that it must be thousands of times\r\nlarger than the sun. A few stars are known to be smaller than the sun.\r\nSome are, intrinsically, far more brilliant; some far less brilliant.\r\n\r\nAnother method has been adopted, though this also must be regarded\r\nwith great reserve. The distance of the nearer stars can be positively\r\nmeasured, and this has been done in a large number of cases. The\r\nproportion of such cases to the whole is still very small, but, as far\r\nas the results go, we find that stars of the first magnitude are, on the\r\naverage, nearly 200 billion miles away; stars of the second magnitude\r\nnearly 300 billion; and stars of the third magnitude 450 billion. If\r\nthis fifty per cent increase of distance for each lower magnitude of\r\nstars were certain and constant, the stars of the eighth magnitude would\r\nbe 3000 billion miles away, and stars of the sixteenth magnitude would\r\nbe 100,000 billion miles away; and there are still two fainter classes\r\nof stars which are registered on long-exposure photographs. The mere\r\nvastness of these figures is immaterial to the astronomer, but he warns\r\nus that the method is uncertain. We may be content to conclude that the\r\nstarry universe over which our great telescopes keep watch stretches for\r\nthousands, and probably tens of thousands, of billions of miles. There\r\nare myriads of stars so remote that, though each is a vast incandescent\r\nglobe at a temperature of many thousand degrees, and though their\r\nlight is concentrated on the mirrors or in the lenses of our largest\r\ntelescopes and directed upon the photographic plate at the rate of more\r\nthan 800 billion waves a second, they take several hours to register the\r\nfaintest point of light on the plate.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect that the universe has grown with the growth of our\r\ntelescopes and the application of photography we wonder whether we may\r\nas yet see only a fraction of the real universe, as small in comparison\r\nwith the whole as the Babylonian system was in comparison with ours. We\r\nmust be content to wonder. Some affirm that the universe is infinite;\r\nothers that it is limited. We have no firm ground in science for either\r\nassertion. Those who claim that the system is limited point out that, as\r\nthe stars decrease in brightness, they increase so enormously in number\r\nthat the greater faintness is more than compensated, and therefore, if\r\nthere were an infinite series of magnitudes, the midnight sky would be a\r\nblaze of light. But this theoretical reasoning does not allow for dense\r\nregions of space that may obstruct the light, or vast regions of vacancy\r\nbetween vast systems of stars. Even apart from the evidence that dark\r\nnebulae or other special light-absorbing regions do exist, the question\r\nis under discussion in science at the present moment whether light is\r\nnot absorbed in the passage through ordinary space. There is reason to\r\nthink that it is. Let us leave precarious speculations about finiteness\r\nand infinity to philosophers, and take the universe as we know it.\r\n\r\nPicture, then, on the more moderate estimate, these 500,000,000 suns\r\nscattered over tens of thousands of billions of miles. Whether they form\r\none stupendous system, and what its structure may be, is too obscure a\r\nsubject to be discussed here. Imagine yourself standing at a point\r\nfrom which you can survey the whole system and see into the depths and\r\ndetails of it. At one point is a single star (like our sun), billions\r\nof miles from its nearest neighbour, wearing out its solitary life in a\r\nportentous discharge of energy. Commonly the stars are in pairs, turning\r\nround a common centre in periods that may occupy hundreds of days or\r\nhundreds of years. Here and there they are gathered into clusters,\r\nsometimes to the number of thousands in a cluster, travelling together\r\nover the desert of space, or trailing in lines like luminous caravans.\r\nAll are rushing headlong at inconceivable speeds. Few are known to be so\r\nsluggish as to run, like our sun, at only 8000 miles an hour. One of\r\nthe \"fixed\" stars of the ancients, the mighty Arcturus, darts along at\r\na rate of more than 250 miles a second. As they rush, their surfaces\r\nglowing at a temperature anywhere between 1000 and 20,000 degrees C.,\r\nthey shake the environing space with electric waves from every tiny\r\nparticle of their body at a rate of from 400 billion to 800 billion\r\nwaves a second. And somewhere round the fringe of one of the smaller\r\nsuns there is a little globe, more than a million times smaller than the\r\nsolitary star it attends, lost in the blaze of its light, on which human\r\nbeings find a home during a short and late chapter of its history.\r\n\r\nLook at it again from another aspect. Every colour of the rainbow is\r\nfound in the stars. Emerald, azure, ruby, gold, lilac, topaz, fawn--they\r\nshine with wonderful and mysterious beauty. But, whether these more\r\ndelicate shades be really in the stars or no, three colours are\r\ncertainly found in them. The stars sink from bluish white to yellow, and\r\non to deep red. The immortal fires of the Greeks are dying. Piercing the\r\ndepths with a dull red glow, here and there, are the dying suns; and if\r\nyou look closely you will see, flitting like ghosts across the light\r\nof their luminous neighbours, the gaunt frames of dead worlds. Here and\r\nthere are vast stretches of loose cosmic dust that seems to be gathering\r\ninto embryonic stars; here and there are stars in infancy or in\r\nstrenuous youth. You detect all the chief phases of the making of a\r\nworld in the forms and fires of these colossal aggregations of matter.\r\nLike the chance crowd on which you may look down in the square of a\r\ngreat city, they range from the infant to the worn and sinking aged.\r\nThere is this difference, however, that the embryos of worlds sprawl,\r\ngigantic and luminous, across the expanse; that the dark and mighty\r\nbodies of the dead rush, like the rest, at twenty or fifty miles a\r\nsecond; and that at intervals some appalling blaze, that dims even the\r\nfearful furnaces of the living, seems to announce the resurrection of\r\nthe dead. And there is this further difference, that, strewn about the\r\nintermediate space between the gigantic spheres, is a mass of cosmic\r\ndust--minute grains, or large blocks, or shoals consisting of myriads of\r\npieces, or immeasurable clouds of fine gas--that seems to be the rubbish\r\nleft over after the making of worlds, or the material gathering for the\r\nmaking of other worlds.\r\n\r\nThis is the universe that the nineteenth century discovered and the\r\ntwentieth century is interpreting. Before we come to tell the fortunes\r\nof our little earth we have to see how matter is gathered into these\r\nstupendous globes of fire, how they come sometimes to have smaller\r\nbodies circling round them on which living things may appear, how they\r\nsupply the heat and light and electricity that the living things need,\r\nand how the story of life on a planet is but a fragment of a larger\r\nstory. We have to study the birth and death of worlds, perhaps the most\r\nimpressive of all the studies that modern science offers us. Indeed, if\r\nwe would read the whole story of evolution, there is an earlier chapter\r\neven than this; the latest chapter to be opened by science, the first to\r\nbe read. We have to ask where the matter, which we are going to gather\r\ninto worlds, itself came from; to understand more clearly what is the\r\nrelation to it of the forces or energies--gravitation, electricity,\r\netc.--with which we glibly mould it into worlds, or fashion it into\r\nliving things; and, above all, to find out its relation to this\r\nmysterious ocean of ether in which it is found.\r\n\r\nLess than half a century ago the making of worlds was, in popular\r\nexpositions of science, a comparatively easy business. Take an\r\nindefinite number of atoms of various gases and metals, scatter them\r\nin a fine cloud over some thousands of millions of miles of space, let\r\ngravitation slowly compress the cloud into a globe, its temperature\r\nrising through the compression, let it throw off a ring of matter, which\r\nin turn gravitation will compress into a globe, and you have your earth\r\ncirculating round the sun. It is not quite so simple; in any case,\r\nserious men of science wanted to know how these convenient and assorted\r\natoms happened to be there at all, and what was the real meaning of this\r\nequally convenient gravitation. There was a greater truth than he knew\r\nin the saying of an early physicist, that the atom had the look of a\r\n\"manufactured article.\" It was increasingly felt, as the nineteenth\r\ncentury wore on, that the atoms had themselves been evolved out of some\r\nsimpler material, and that ether might turn out to be the primordial\r\nchaos. There were even those who felt that ether would prove to be the\r\none source of all matter and energy. And just before the century closed\r\na light began to shine in those deeper abysses of the submaterial world,\r\nand the foundations of the universe began to appear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE UNIVERSE\r\n\r\nTo the mind of the vast majority of earlier observers the phrase\r\n\"foundations of the universe\" would have suggested something enormously\r\nmassive and solid. From what we have already seen we are prepared, on\r\nthe contrary, to pass from the inconceivably large to the inconceivably\r\nsmall. Our sun is, as far as our present knowledge goes, one of modest\r\ndimensions. Arcturus and Canopus must be thousands of times larger than\r\nit. Yet our sun is 320,000 times heavier than the earth, and the earth\r\nweighs some 6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons. But it is only in\r\nresolving these stupendous masses into their tiniest elements that we\r\ncan reach the ultimate realities, or foundations, of the whole.\r\n\r\nModern science rediscovered the atoms of Democritus, analysed the\r\nuniverse into innumerable swarms of these tiny particles, and then\r\nshowed how the infinite variety of things could be built up by their\r\ncombinations. For this it was necessary to suppose that the atoms were\r\nnot all alike, but belonged to a large number of different classes. From\r\ntwenty-six letters of the alphabet we could make millions of different\r\nwords. From forty or fifty different \"elements\" the chemist could\r\nconstruct the most varied objects in nature, from the frame of a man to\r\na landscape. But improved methods of research led to the discovery\r\nof new elements, and at last the chemist found that he had seventy or\r\neighty of these \"ultimate realities,\" each having its own very definite\r\nand very different characters. As it is the experience of science to\r\nfind unity underlying variety, this was profoundly unsatisfactory, and\r\nthe search began for the great unity which underlay the atoms of matter.\r\nThe difficulty of the search may be illustrated by a few figures. Very\r\ndelicate methods were invented for calculating the size of the atoms.\r\nLaymen are apt to smile--it is a very foolish smile--at these figures,\r\nbut it is enough to say that the independent and even more delicate\r\nmethods suggested by recent progress in physics have quite confirmed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nTake a cubic millimetre of hydrogen. As a millimetre is less than 1/25th\r\nof an inch, the reader must imagine a tiny bubble of gas that would fit\r\ncomfortably inside the letter \"o\" as it is printed here. The various\r\nrefined methods of the modern physicist show that there are 40,000\r\nbillion molecules (each consisting of two atoms of the gas) in this tiny\r\nbubble. It is a little universe, repeating on an infinitesimal scale the\r\nnumbers and energies of the stellar universe. These molecules are not\r\npacked together, moreover, but are separated from each other by spaces\r\nwhich are enormous in proportion to the size of the atoms. Through these\r\nempty spaces the atoms dash at an average speed of more than a thousand\r\nmiles an hour, each passing something like 6,000,000,000 of its\r\nneighbours in the course of every second. Yet this particle of gas is\r\na thinly populated world in comparison with a particle of metal. Take\r\na cubic centimetre of copper. In that very small square of solid matter\r\n(each side of the cube measuring a little more than a third of an inch)\r\nthere are about a quadrillion atoms. It is these minute and elusive\r\nparticles that modern physics sets out to master.\r\n\r\nAt first it was noticed that the atom of hydrogen was the smallest or\r\nlightest of all, and the other atoms seemed to be multiples of it.\r\nA Russian chemist, Mendeleeff, drew up a table of the elements in\r\nillustration of this, grouping them in families, which seemed to point\r\nto hydrogen as the common parent, or ultimate constituent, of each. When\r\nnewly discovered elements fell fairly into place in this scheme the idea\r\nwas somewhat confidently advanced that the evolution of the elements was\r\ndiscovered. Thus an atom of carbon seemed to be a group of 12 atoms of\r\nhydrogen, an atom of oxygen 16, an atom of sulphur 32, an atom of copper\r\n64, an atom of silver 108, an atom of gold 197, and so on. But more\r\ncorrect measurements showed that these figures were not quite exact, and\r\nthe fraction of inexactness killed the theory.\r\n\r\nLong before the end of the nineteenth century students were looking\r\nwistfully to the ether for some explanation of the mystery. It was the\r\nveiled statue of Isis in the scientific world, and it resolutely kept\r\nits veil in spite of all progress. The \"upper and limpid air\" of the\r\nGreeks, the cosmic ocean of Giordano Bruno, was now an established\r\nreality. It was the vehicle that bore the terrific streams of energy\r\nfrom star to planet across the immense reaches of space. As the atoms of\r\nmatter lay in it, one thought of the crystal forming in its mother-lye,\r\nor the star forming in the nebula, and wondered whether the atom was not\r\nin some such way condensed out of the ether. By the last decade of the\r\ncentury the theory was confidently advanced--notably by Lorentz and\r\nLarmor--though it was still without a positive basis. How the basis was\r\nfound, in the last decade of the nineteenth century, may be told very\r\nbriefly.\r\n\r\nSir William Crookes had in 1874 applied himself to the task of creating\r\nsomething more nearly like a vacuum than the old air-pumps afforded.\r\nWhen he had found the means of reducing the quantity of gas in a tube\r\nuntil it was a million times thinner than the atmosphere, he made the\r\nexperiment of sending an electric discharge through it, and found a very\r\ncurious result. From the cathode (the negative electric point) certain\r\nrays proceeded which caused a green fluorescence on the glass of the\r\ntube. Since the discharge did not consist of the atoms of the gas, he\r\nconcluded that it was a new and mysterious substance, which he called\r\n\"radiant matter.\" But no progress was made in the interpretation of\r\nthis strange material. The Crookes tube became one of the toys of\r\nscience--and the lamp of other investigators.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 Rontgen drew closer attention to the Crookes tube by discovering\r\nthe rays which he called X-rays, but which now bear his name. They\r\ndiffer from ordinary light-waves in their length, their irregularity,\r\nand especially their power to pass through opaque bodies. A number of\r\ndistinguished physicists now took up the study of the effect of sending\r\nan electric discharge through a vacuum, and the particles of \"radiant\r\nmatter\" were soon identified. Sir J. J. Thomson, especially, was\r\nbrilliantly successful in his interpretation. He proved that they were\r\ntiny corpuscles, more than a thousand times smaller than the atom of\r\nhydrogen, charged with negative electricity, and travelling at the\r\nrate of thousands of miles a second. They were the \"electrons\" in which\r\nmodern physics sees the long-sought constituents of the atom.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had interest been thoroughly aroused than it was announced\r\nthat a fresh discovery had opened a new shaft into the underworld. Sir\r\nJ. J. Thomson, pursuing his research, found in 1896 that compounds of\r\nuranium sent out rays that could penetrate black paper and affect the\r\nphotographic plate; though in this case the French physicist, Becquerel,\r\nmade the discovery simultaneously' and was the first to publish it. An\r\narmy of investigators turned into the new field, and sought to penetrate\r\nthe deep abyss that had almost suddenly disclosed itself. The quickening\r\nof astronomy by Galilei, or of zoology by Darwin, was slight in\r\ncomparison with the stirring of our physical world by these increasing\r\ndiscoveries. And in 1898 M. and Mme. Curie made the further discovery\r\nwhich, in the popular mind, obliterated all the earlier achievements.\r\nThey succeeded in isolating the new element, radium, which exhibits the\r\nactual process of an atom parting with its minute constituents.\r\n\r\nThe story of radium is so recent that a few lines will suffice to recall\r\nas much as is needed for the purpose of this chapter. In their study of\r\nthe emanations from uranium compounds the Curies were led to isolate\r\nthe various elements of the compounds until they discovered that the\r\ndischarge was predominantly due to one specific element, radium. Radium\r\nis itself probably a product of the disintegration of uranium, the\r\nheaviest of known metals, with an atomic weight some 240 times greater\r\nthan that of hydrogen. But this massive atom of uranium has a life that\r\nis computed in thousands of millions of years. It is in radium and its\r\noffspring that we see most clearly the constitution of matter.\r\n\r\nA gramme (less than 15 1/2 grains) of radium contains--we will economise\r\nour space--4x10 (superscript)21 atoms. This tiny mass is, by its\r\ndischarge, parting with its substance at the rate of one atom per second\r\nfor every 10,000,000,000 atoms; in other words, the \"indestructible\"\r\natom has, in this case, a term of life not exceeding 2500 years. In the\r\ndischarge from the radium three elements have been distinguished. The\r\nfirst consists of atoms of the gas helium, which are hurled off at\r\nbetween 10,000 and 20,000 miles a second. The third element (in the\r\norder of classification) consists of waves analogous to the Rontgen\r\nrays. But the second element is a stream of electrons, which are\r\nexpelled from the atom at the appalling speed of about 100,000 miles\r\na second. Professor Le Bon has calculated that it would take 340,000\r\nbarrels of powder to discharge a bullet at that speed. But we shall see\r\nmore presently of the enormous energy displayed within the little system\r\nof the atom. We may add that after its first transformation the radium\r\npasses, much more quickly, through a further series of changes. The\r\nfrontiers of the atomic systems were breaking down.\r\n\r\nThe next step was for students (notably Soddy and Rutherford) to find\r\nthat radio-activity, or spontaneous discharge out of the atomic systems,\r\nwas not confined to radium. Not only are other rare metals conspicuously\r\nactive, but it is found that such familiar surfaces as damp cellars,\r\nrain, snow, etc., emit a lesser discharge. The value of the new\r\nmaterial thus provided for the student of physics may be shown by\r\none illustration. Sir J. J. Thomson observes that before these recent\r\ndiscoveries the investigator could not detect a gas unless about a\r\nbillion molecules of it were present, and it must be remembered that the\r\nspectroscope had already gone far beyond ordinary chemical analysis in\r\ndetecting the presence of substances in minute quantities. Since these\r\ndiscoveries we can recognise a single molecule, bearing an electric\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nWith these extraordinary powers the physicist is able to penetrate\r\na world that lies immeasurably below the range of the most powerful\r\nmicroscope, and introduce us to systems more bewildering than those of\r\nthe astronomer. We pass from a portentous Brobdingnagia to a still more\r\nportentous Lilliputia. It has been ascertained that the mass of the\r\nelectron is the 1/1700th part of that of an atom of hydrogen, of which,\r\nas we saw, billions of molecules have ample space to execute their\r\nterrific movements within the limits of the letter \"o.\" It has been\r\nfurther shown that these electrons are identical, from whatever source\r\nthey are obtained. The physicist therefore concludes--warning us that\r\non this further point he is drawing a theoretical conclusion--that the\r\natoms of ordinary matter are made up of electrons. If that is the case,\r\nthe hydrogen atom, the lightest of all, must be a complex system of some\r\n1700 electrons, and as we ascend the scale of atomic weight the clusters\r\ngrow larger and larger, until we come to the atoms of the heavier metals\r\nwith more than 250,000 electrons in each atom.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the most surprising part of the discovery. Tiny as the\r\ndimensions of the atom are, they afford a vast space for the movement of\r\nthese energetic little bodies. The speed of the stars in their courses\r\nis slow compared with the flight of the electrons. Since they fly out of\r\nthe system, in the conditions we have described, at a speed of between\r\n90,000 and 100,000 miles a second, they must be revolving with terrific\r\nrapidity within it. Indeed, the most extraordinary discovery of all is\r\nthat of the energy imprisoned within these tiny systems, which men have\r\nfor ages regarded as \"dead\" matter. Sir J. J. Thomson calculates that,\r\nallowing only one electron to each atom in a gramme of hydrogen, the\r\ntiny globule of gas will contain as much energy as would be obtained by\r\nburning thirty-five tons of coal. If, he says, an appreciable fraction\r\nof the energy that is contained in ordinary matter were to be set free,\r\nthe earth would explode and return to its primitive nebulous condition.\r\nMr. Fournier d'Albe tells us that the force with which electrons repel\r\neach other is a quadrillion times greater than the force of gravitation\r\nthat brings atoms together; and that if two grammes of pure electrons\r\ncould be placed one centimetre apart they would repel each other with a\r\nforce equal to 320 quadrillion tons. The inexpert imagination reels,\r\nbut it must be remembered that the speed of the electron is a measured\r\nquantity, and it is within the resources of science to estimate the\r\nforce necessary to project it at that speed. [*]\r\n\r\n     * See Sir J. J. Thomson, \"The Corpuscular Theory of Matter\"\r\n     (1907) and--for a more elementary presentment--\"Light\r\n     Visible and Invisible\" (1911); and Mr. Fournier d'Albe, \"The\r\n     Electron Theory\" (2nd. ed., 1907).\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch are the discoveries of the last fifteen years and a few of the\r\nmathematical deductions from them. We are not yet in a position to say\r\npositively that the atoms are composed of electrons, but it is clear\r\nthat the experts are properly modest in claiming only that this is\r\nhighly probable. The atom seems to be a little universe in which, in\r\ncombination with positive electricity (the nature of which is still\r\nextremely obscure), from 1700 to 300,000 electrons revolve at a speed\r\nthat reaches as high as 100,000 miles a second. Instead of being\r\ncrowded together, however, in their minute system, each of them has, in\r\nproportion to its size, as ample a space to move in as a single speck of\r\ndust would have in a moderate-sized room (Thomson). This theory not only\r\nmeets all the facts that have been discovered in an industrious decade\r\nof research, not only offers a splendid prospect of introducing unity\r\ninto the eighty-one different elements of the chemist, but it opens out\r\na still larger prospect of bringing a common measure into the diverse\r\nforces of the universe.\r\n\r\nLight is already generally recognised as a rapid series of\r\nelectro-magnetic waves or pulses in ether. Magnetism becomes\r\nintelligible as a condition of a body in which the electrons revolve\r\nround the atom in nearly the same plane. The difference between positive\r\nand negative electricity is at least partly illuminated. An atom will\r\nrepel an atom when its equilibrium is disturbed by the approach of an\r\nadditional electron; the physicist even follows the movement of the\r\nadded electron, and describes it revolving 2200 billion times a second\r\nround the atom, to escape being absorbed in it. The difference between\r\ngood and bad conductors of electricity becomes intelligible. The atoms\r\nof metals are so close together that the roaming electrons pass freely\r\nfrom one atom to another, in copper, it is calculated, the electron\r\ncombines with an atom and is liberated again a hundred million times a\r\nsecond. Even chemical action enters the sphere of explanation.\r\n\r\nHowever these hypotheses may fare, the electron is a fact, and the atom\r\nis very probably a more or less stable cluster of electrons. But when\r\nwe go further, and attempt to trace the evolution of the electron out\r\nof ether, we enter a region of pure theory. Some of the experts conceive\r\nthe electron as a minute whirlpool or vortex in the ocean of ether;\r\nsome hold that it is a centre of strain in ether; some regard ether as\r\na densely packed mass of infinitely small grains, and think that the\r\npositive and negative corpuscles, as they seem to us, are tiny areas\r\nin which the granules are unequally distributed. Each theory has its\r\ndifficulties. We do not know the origin of the electron, because we do\r\nnot know the nature of ether. To some it is an elastic solid, quivering\r\nin waves at every movement of the particles; to others it is a\r\ncontinuous fluid, every cubic millimetre of which possesses \"an energy\r\nequivalent to the output of a million-horse-power station for 40.000,000\r\nyears\" (Lodge); to others it is a close-packed granular mass with a\r\npressure of 10,000 tons per square centimetre. We must wait. It is\r\nlittle over ten years since the vaults were opened and physicists began\r\nto peer into the sub-material world. The lower, perhaps lowest, depth is\r\nreserved for another generation.\r\n\r\nBut it may be said that the research of the last ten years has given\r\nus a glimpse of the foundations of the universe. Every theory of the\r\nelectron assumes it to be some sort of nodule or disturbed area in the\r\nether. It is sometimes described as \"a particle of negative electricity\"\r\nand associated with \"a particle of positive electricity\" in building up\r\nthe atom. The phrase is misleading for those who regard electricity as a\r\nforce or energy, and it gives rise to speculation as to whether \"matter\"\r\nhas not been resolved into \"force.\" Force or energy is not conceived\r\nby physicists as a substantial reality, like matter, but an abstract\r\nexpression of certain relations of matter or electrons.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the ether, whether solid or fluid or granular, remains the\r\nfundamental reality. The universe does not float IN an ocean of ether:\r\nit IS an ocean of ether. But countless myriads of minute disturbances\r\nare found in this ocean, and set it quivering with the various pulses\r\nwhich we classify as forces or energies. These points of disturbance\r\ncluster together in systems (atoms) of from 1000 to 250,000 members,\r\nand the atoms are pressed together until they come in the end to form\r\nmassive worlds. It remains only to reduce gravitation itself, which\r\nbrings the atoms together, to a strain or stress in ether, and we have\r\na superb unity. That has not yet been done, but every theory of\r\ngravitation assumes that it is a stress in the ether corresponding to\r\nthe formation of the minute disturbances which we call electrons.\r\n\r\nBut, it may be urged, he who speaks of foundations speaks of a beginning\r\nof a structure; he who speaks of evolution must have a starting-point.\r\nWas there a time when the ether was a smooth, continuous fluid, without\r\nelectrons or atoms, and did they gradually appear in it, like crystals\r\nin the mother-lye? In science we know nothing of a beginning. The\r\nquestion of the eternity or non-eternity of matter (or ether) is as\r\nfutile as the question about its infinity or finiteness. We shall see in\r\nthe next chapter that science can trace the processes of nature back\r\nfor hundreds, if not thousands, of millions of years, and has ground to\r\nthink that the universe then presented much the same aspect as it does\r\nnow, and will in thousands of millions of years to come. But if these\r\nperiods were quadrillions, instead of millions, of years, they would\r\nstill have no relation to the idea of eternity. All that we can say is\r\nthat we find nothing in nature that points to a beginning or an end. [*]\r\n\r\n     * A theory has been advanced by some physicists that there\r\n     is evidence of a beginning. WITHIN OUR EXPERIENCE energy is\r\n     being converted into heat more abundantly than heat is being\r\n     converted into other energy. This would hold out a prospect\r\n     of a paralysed universe, and that stage would have been\r\n     reached long ago if the system had not had a definite\r\n     beginning. But what knowledge have we of conversions of\r\n     energy in remote regions of space, in the depths of stars or\r\n     nebulae, or in the sub-material world of which we have just\r\n     caught a glimpse? Roundly, none. The speculation is\r\n     worthless.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne point only need be mentioned in conclusion. Do we anywhere perceive\r\nthe evolution of the material elements out of electrons, just as we\r\nperceive the devolution, or disintegration, of atoms into electrons?\r\nThere is good ground for thinking that we do. The subject will be\r\ndiscussed more fully in the next chapter. In brief, the spectroscope,\r\nwhich examines the light of distant stars and discovers what chemical\r\nelements emitted it, finds matter, in the hottest stars, in an unusual\r\ncondition, and seems to show the elements successively emerging from\r\ntheir fierce alchemy. Sir J. Norman Lockyer has for many years conducted\r\na special investigation of the subject at the Solar Physics Observatory,\r\nand he declares that we can trace the evolution of the elements out of\r\nthe fiery chaos of the young star. The lightest gases emerge first, the\r\nmetals later, and in a special form. But here we pass once more from\r\nLilliputia to Brobdingnagia, and must first explain the making of the\r\nstar itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. THE BIRTH AND DEATH OF WORLDS\r\n\r\nThe greater part of this volume will be occupied with the things that\r\nhave happened on one small globe in the universe during a certain number\r\nof millions of years. It cannot be denied that this has a somewhat\r\nnarrow and parochial aspect. The earth is, you remember, a million times\r\nsmaller than the sun, and the sun itself is a very modest citizen of\r\nthe stellar universe. Our procedure is justified, however, both on the\r\nground of personal interest, and because our knowledge of the earth's\r\nstory is so much more ample and confident. Yet we must preface the story\r\nof the earth with at least a general outline of the larger story of the\r\nuniverse. No sensible man is humbled or dismayed by the vastness of\r\nthe universe. When the human mind reflects on its wonderful scientific\r\nmastery of this illimitable ocean of being, it has no sentiment of being\r\ndwarfed or degraded. It looks out with cold curiosity over the mighty\r\nscattering of worlds, and asks how they, including our own world, came\r\ninto being.\r\n\r\nWe now approach this subject with a clearer perception of the work we\r\nhave to do. The universe is a vast expanse of ether, and somehow or\r\nother this ether gives rise to atoms of matter. We may imagine it as a\r\nspacious chamber filled with cosmic dust; recollecting that the chamber\r\nhas no walls, and that the dust arises in the ether itself. The problem\r\nwe now approach is, in a word: How are these enormous stretches of\r\ncosmic dust, which we call matter, swept together and compressed\r\ninto suns and planets? The most famous answer to this question is the\r\n\"nebular hypothesis.\" Let us see, briefly, how it came into modern\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nWe saw that some of the ancient Greek speculators imagined their\r\ninfinite number of atoms as scattered originally, like dust, throughout\r\nspace and gradually coming together, as dust does, to form worlds. The\r\nway in which they brought their atoms together was wrong, but the genius\r\nof Democritus had provided the germ of another sound theory to the\r\nstudents of a more enlightened age. Descartes (1596-1650) recalled the\r\nidea, and set out a theory of the evolution of stars and planets from a\r\ndiffused chaos of particles. He even ventured to say that the earth was\r\nat one time a small white-hot sun, and that a solid crust had gradually\r\nformed round its molten core. Descartes had taken refuge in Sweden from\r\nhis persecutors, and it is therefore not surprising that that strange\r\ngenius Swedenborg shortly afterwards developed the same idea. In the\r\nmiddle of the eighteenth century the great French naturalist, Buffon,\r\nfollowed and improved upon Descartes and Swedenborg. From Buffon's work\r\nit was learned by the German philosopher Kant, who published (1755)\r\na fresh theory of the concentration of scattered particles into fiery\r\nworlds. Then Laplace (1749-1827) took up the speculation, and gave\r\nit the form in which it practically ruled astronomy throughout the\r\nnineteenth century. That is the genealogy of the famous nebular\r\nhypothesis. It did not spring full-formed from the brain of either Kant\r\nor Laplace, like Athene from the brain of Zeus.\r\n\r\nLaplace had one great advantage over the early speculators. Not only was\r\nhe an able astronomer and mathematician, but by his time it was known\r\nthat nebulae, or vast clouds of dispersed matter, actually existed in\r\nthe heavens. Here was a solid basis for the speculation. Sir William\r\nHerschel, the most assiduous explorer of the heavens, was a contemporary\r\nof Laplace. Laplace therefore took the nebula as his starting-point.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an ounce of solid matter (say, tobacco) will fill a vast\r\nspace when it is turned into smoke, and if it were not for the pressure\r\nof the atmosphere it would expand still more. Laplace imagined the\r\nbillions of tons of matter which constitute our solar system similarly\r\ndispersed, converted into a fine gas, immeasurably thinner than\r\nthe atmosphere. This nebula would be gradually drawn in again by\r\ngravitation, just as the dust falls to the floor of a room. The\r\ncollisions of its particles as they fell toward the centre would raise\r\nits temperature and give it a rotating movement. A time would come when\r\nthe centrifugal force at the outer ring of the rotating disk would equal\r\nthe centripetal (or inward) pull of gravity, and this ring would be\r\ndetached, still spinning round the central body. The material of the\r\nring would slowly gather, by gravitation, round some denser area in it;\r\nthe ring would become a sphere; we should have the first, and outermost,\r\nplanet circling round the sun. Other rings would successively be\r\ndetached, and form the rest of the planets; and the sun is the shrunken\r\nand condensed body of the nebula.\r\n\r\nSo simple and beautiful a theory of the solar system could not fail\r\nto captivate astronomers, but it is generally rejected to-day, in the\r\nprecise form which Laplace gave it. What the difficulties are which\r\nit has encountered, and the modifications it must suffer, we shall see\r\nlater; as well as the new theories which have largely displaced it. It\r\nwill be better first to survey the universe from the evolutionary point\r\nof view. But I may observe, in passing, that the sceptical remarks one\r\nhears at times about scientific theories contradicting and superseding\r\neach other are frivolous. One great idea pervades all the theories of\r\nthe evolution of worlds, and that idea is firmly established. The\r\nstars and their planets are enormous aggregations of cosmic dust, swept\r\ntogether and compressed by the action of gravitation. The precise nature\r\nof this cosmic dust--whether it was gas, meteorites and gas, or other\r\nparticles--is open to question.\r\n\r\nAs we saw in the first chapter, the universe has the word evolution\r\nwritten, literally, in letters of fire across it. The stars are of all\r\nages, from sturdy youth to decrepit age, and even to the darkness of\r\ndeath. We saw that this can be detected on the superficial test of\r\ncolour. The colours of the stars are, it is true, an unsafe ground to\r\nbuild upon. The astronomer still puzzles over the gorgeous colours\r\nhe finds at times, especially in double stars: the topaz and azure\r\ncompanions in beta Cygni, the emerald and red of alpha Herculis, the\r\nyellow and rose of eta Cassiopeiae, and so on. It is at the present time\r\nunder discussion in astronomy how far these colours are objective at\r\nall, or whether, if they are real, they may not be due to causes other\r\nthan temperature. Yet the significance of the three predominating\r\ncolours--blue-white, yellow, and red--has been sustained by the\r\nspectroscope. It is the series of colours through which a white-hot bar\r\nof iron passes as it cools. And the spectroscope gives us good ground to\r\nconclude that the stars are cooling.\r\n\r\nWhen a glowing gas (not under great pressure) is examined by the\r\nspectroscope, it yields a few vertical lines or bars of light on a\r\ndark background; when a glowing liquid or solid is examined, it gives a\r\ncontinuous rainbow-like stretch of colour. Some of the nebulae give the\r\nformer type of spectrum, and are thus known to be masses of luminous\r\ngas; many of the nebulae and the stars have the latter type of\r\nspectrum. But the stretch of light in the spectrum of a star is crossed,\r\nvertically, by a number of dark lines, and experiment in the laboratory\r\nhas taught us how to interpret these. They mean that there is some\r\nlight-absorbing vapour between the source of light and the instrument.\r\nIn the case of the stars they indicate the presence of an atmosphere\r\nof relatively cool vapours, and an increase in the density of that\r\natmosphere--which is shown by a multiplication and broadening of\r\nthe dark lines on the spectrum--means an increase of age, a loss of\r\nvitality, and ultimately death. So we get the descending scale of\r\nspectra. The dark lines are thinnest and least numerous in the blue\r\nstars, more numerous in the yellow, heavy and thick in the red. As the\r\nbody of the star sinks in temperature dense masses of cool vapour gather\r\nabout it. Its light, as we perceive it, turns yellow, then red. The next\r\nstep, which the spectroscope cannot follow, will be the formation of\r\na scum on the cooling surface, ending, after ages of struggle, in the\r\nimprisonment of the molten interior under a solid, dark crust. Let us\r\nsee how our sun illustrates this theory.\r\n\r\nIt is in the yellow, or what we may call the autumnal, stage. Miss\r\nClerke and a few others have questioned this, but the evidence is too\r\nstrong to-day. The vast globe, 867,000 miles in diameter, seems to be a\r\nmass of much the same material as the earth--about forty elements have\r\nbeen identified in it--but at a terrific temperature. The light-giving\r\nsurface is found, on the most recent calculations, to have a temperature\r\nof about 6700 degrees C. This surface is an ocean of liquid or vaporised\r\nmetals, several thousand miles in depth; some think that the brilliant\r\nlight comes chiefly from clouds of incandescent carbon. Overlying it is\r\na deep layer of the vapours of the molten metals, with a temperature\r\nof about 5500 degrees C.; and to this comparatively cool and\r\nlight-absorbing layer we owe the black lines of the solar spectrum.\r\nAbove it is an ocean of red-hot hydrogen, and outside this again is\r\nan atmosphere stretching for some hundreds of thousands of miles into\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nThe significant feature, from our point of view, is the \"sun-spot\";\r\nthough the spot may be an area of millions of square miles. These areas\r\nare, of course, dark only by comparison with the intense light of the\r\nrest of the disk. The darkest part of them is 5000 times brighter than\r\nthe full moon. It will be seen further, on examining a photograph of\r\nthe sun, that a network or veining of this dark material overspreads the\r\nentire surface at all times. There is still some difference of opinion\r\nas to the nature of these areas, but the evidence of the spectroscope\r\nhas convinced most astronomers that they are masses of cooler vapour\r\nlying upon, and sinking into, the ocean of liquid fire. Round their\r\nedges, as if responding to the pressure of the more condensed mass,\r\ngigantic spurts and mountains of the white-hot matter of the sun rush\r\nupwards at a rate of fifty or a hundred miles a second, Sometimes they\r\nreach a height of a hundred, and even two hundred, thousand miles,\r\ndriving the red-hot hydrogen before them in prodigious and fantastic\r\nflames. Between the black veins over the disk, also, there rise domes\r\nand columns of the liquid fire, some hundreds of miles in diameter,\r\nspreading and sinking at from five to twenty miles a second. The surface\r\nof the sun--how much more the interior!--is an appalling cauldron of\r\nincandescent matter from pole to pole. Every yard of the surface is\r\na hundred times as intense as the open furnace of a Titanic. From the\r\ndepths and from the surface of this fiery ocean, as, on a small scale,\r\nfrom the surface of the tropical sea, the vapours rise high into the\r\nextensive atmosphere, discharge some of their heat into space, and sink\r\nback, cooler and heavier, upon the disk.\r\n\r\nThis is a star in its yellow age, as are Capella and Arcturus and other\r\nstars. The red stars carry the story further, as we should expect. The\r\nheavier lines in their spectrum indicate more absorption of light, and\r\ntell us that the vapours are thickening about the globe; while compounds\r\nlike titanium oxide make their appearance, announcing a fall of\r\ntemperature. Below these, again, is a group of dark red or \"carbon\"\r\nstars, in which the process is carried further. Thick, broad, dark lines\r\nin the red end of the spectrum announce the appearance of compounds\r\nof carbon, and a still lower fall of temperature. The veil is growing\r\nthicker; the life is ebbing from the great frame. Then the star sinks\r\nbelow the range of visibility, and one would think that we can follow\r\nthe dying world no farther. Fortunately, in the case of Algol and some\r\nthirty or forty other stars, an extinct sun betrays its existence by\r\nflitting across the light of a luminous sun, and recent research has\r\nmade it probable that the universe is strewn with dead worlds. Some of\r\nthem may be still in the condition which we seem to find in Jupiter,\r\nhiding sullen fires under a dense shell of cloud; some may already be\r\ncovered with a crust, like the earth. There are even stars in which\r\none is tempted to see an intermediate stage: stars which blaze out\r\nperiodically from dimness, as if the Cyclops were spending his last\r\nenergy in spasms that burst the forming roof of his prison. But these\r\nvariable stars are still obscure, and we do not need their aid. The\r\ndownward course of a star is fairly plain.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the earlier chapters in the life of a star, the story\r\nis less clear. It is at least generally agreed that the blue-white stars\r\nexhibit an earlier and hotter stage. They show comparatively little\r\nabsorption, and there is an immense preponderance of the lighter gases,\r\nhydrogen and helium. They (Sirius, Vega, etc.) are, in fact, known as\r\n\"hydrogen stars,\" and their temperature is generally computed at between\r\n20,000 and 30,000 degrees C. A few stars, such as Procyon and Canopus,\r\nseem to indicate a stage between them and the yellow or solar type.\r\nBut we may avoid finer shades of opinion and disputed classes, and\r\nbe content with these clear stages. We begin with stars in which only\r\nhydrogen and helium, the lightest Of elements, can be traced; and the\r\nhydrogen is in an unfamiliar form, implying terrific temperature. In\r\nthe next stage we find the lines of oxygen, nitrogen, magnesium, and\r\nsilicon. Metals such as iron and copper come later, at first in a\r\nprimitive and unusual form. Lastly we get the compounds of titanium\r\nand carbon, and the densely shaded spectra which tell of the thickly\r\ngathering vapours. The intense cold of space is slowly prevailing in the\r\ngreat struggle.\r\n\r\nWhat came before the star? It is now beyond reasonable doubt that the\r\nnebula--taking the word, for the moment, in the general sense of a\r\nloose, chaotic mass of material--was the first stage. Professor Keeler\r\ncalculated that there are at least 120,000 nebulae within range of\r\nour telescopes, and the number is likely to be increased. A German\r\nastronomer recently counted 1528 on one photographic plate. Many of\r\nthem, moreover, are so vast that they must contain the material for\r\nmaking a great number of worlds. Examine a good photograph of the nebula\r\nin Orion. Recollect that each one of the points of light that are\r\ndotted over the expanse is a star of a million miles or more in diameter\r\n(taking our sun as below the average), and that the great cloud that\r\nsprawls across space is at least 10,000 billion miles away; how much\r\nmore no man knows. It is futile to attempt to calculate the extent of\r\nthat vast stretch of luminous gas. We can safely say that it is at least\r\na million times as large as the whole area of our solar system; but it\r\nmay run to trillions or quadrillions of miles.\r\n\r\nNearly a hundred other nebulae are known, by the spectroscope, to be\r\nclouds of luminous gas. It does not follow that they are white-hot, and\r\nthat the nebula is correctly called a \"fire-mist.\" Electrical and other\r\nagencies may make gases luminous, and many astronomers think that the\r\nnebulae are intensely cold. However, the majority of the nebulae that\r\nhave been examined are not gaseous, and have a very different structure\r\nfrom the loose and diffused clouds of gas. They show two (possibly more,\r\nbut generally two) great spiral arms starting from the central part and\r\nwinding out into space. As they are flat or disk-shaped, we see this\r\nstructure plainly when they turn full face toward the earth, as does the\r\nmagnificent nebula in Canes Venatici. In it, and many others, we clearly\r\ntrace a condensed central mass, with two great arms, each apparently\r\nhaving smaller centres of condensation, sprawling outward like the\r\nbroken spring of a watch. The same structure can be traced in the mighty\r\nnebula in Andromeda, which is visible to the naked eye, and it is said\r\nthat more than half the nebulae in the heavens are spiral. Knowing that\r\nthey are masses of solid or liquid fire, we are tempted to see in them\r\ngigantic Catherine-wheels, the fireworks of the gods. What is their\r\nrelation to the stars?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, their mere existence has provided a solid basis for\r\nthe nebular hypothesis, and their spiral form irresistibly suggests\r\nthat they are whirling round on their central axis and concentrating.\r\nFurther, we find in some of the gaseous nebulae (Orion) comparatively\r\nvoid spaces occupied by stars, which seem to have absorbed the nebulous\r\nmatter in their formation. On the other hand, we find (in the Pleiades)\r\nwisps and streamers of nebulous matter clinging about great clusters of\r\nstars, suggesting that they are material left over when these clustered\r\nworlds crystallised out of some vast nebula; and enormous stretches of\r\nnebulous material covering regions (as in Perseus) where the stars are\r\nas thick as grains of silver. More important still, we find a type of\r\ncosmic body which seems intermediate between the star and the nebula.\r\nIt is a more or less imperfectly condensed star, surrounded by nebular\r\nmasses. But one of the most instructive links of all is that at times a\r\nnebula is formed from a star, and a recent case of this character may be\r\nbriefly described.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1901, a new star appeared in the constellation Perseus.\r\nKnowing what a star is, the reader will have some dim conception of the\r\nportentous blaze that lit up that remote region of space (at least 600\r\nbillion miles away) when he learns that the light of this star increased\r\n4000-fold in twenty-eight hours. It reached a brilliance 8000 times\r\ngreater than that of the sun. Telescopes and spectroscopes were turned\r\non it from all parts of the earth, and the spectroscope showed that\r\nmasses of glowing hydrogen were rushing out from it at a rate of nearly\r\na thousand miles a second. Its light gradually flickered and\r\nfell, however, and the star sank back into insignificance. But the\r\nphotographic plate now revealed a new and most instructive feature.\r\nBefore the end of the year there was a nebula, of enormous extent,\r\nspreading out on both sides from the centre of the eruption. It was\r\nsuggested at the time that the bursting of a star may merely have lit up\r\na previously dark nebula, but the spectroscope does not support this. A\r\ndim star had dissolved, wholly or partially, into a nebula, as a result\r\nof some mighty cataclysm. What the nature of the catastrophe was we will\r\ninquire presently.\r\n\r\nThese are a few of the actual connections that we find between stars and\r\nnebulae. Probably, however, the consideration that weighs most with\r\nthe astronomer is that the condensation of such a loose, far-stretched\r\nexpanse of matter affords an admirable explanation of the enormous heat\r\nof the stars. Until recently there was no other conceivable source that\r\nwould supply the sun's tremendous outpour of energy for tens of millions\r\nof years except the compression of its substance. It is true that the\r\ndiscovery of radio-activity has disclosed a new source of energy within\r\nthe atoms themselves, and there are scientific men, like Professor\r\nArrhenius, who attach great importance to this source. But, although it\r\nmay prolong the limited term of life which physicists formerly allotted\r\nto the sun and other stars, it is still felt that the condensation of a\r\nnebula offers the best explanation of the origin of a sun, and we have\r\nample evidence for the connection. We must, therefore, see what the\r\nnebula is, and how it develops.\r\n\r\n\"Nebula\" is merely the Latin word for cloud. Whatever the nature of\r\nthese diffused stretches of matter may be, then, the name applies fitly\r\nto them, and any theory of the development of a star from them is still\r\na \"nebular hypothesis.\" But the three theories which divide astronomers\r\nto-day differ as to the nature of the nebula. The older theory, pointing\r\nto the gaseous nebulae as the first stage, holds that the nebula is a\r\ncloud of extremely attenuated gas. The meteoritic hypothesis (Sir N.\r\nLockyer, Sir G. Darwin, etc.), observing that space seems to swarm\r\nwith meteors and that the greater part of the nebulae are not gaseous,\r\nbelieves that the starting-point is a colossal swarm of meteors,\r\nsurrounded by the gases evolved and lit up by their collisions. The\r\nplanetesimal hypothesis, advanced in recent years by Professor Moulton\r\nand Professor Chamberlin, contends that the nebula is a vast cloud of\r\nliquid or solid (but not gaseous) particles. This theory is based mainly\r\non the dynamical difficulties of the other two, which we will notice\r\npresently.\r\n\r\nThe truth often lies between conflicting theories, or they may apply to\r\ndifferent cases. It is not improbable that this will be our experience\r\nin regard to the nature of the initial nebula. The gaseous nebulae,\r\nand the formation of such nebulae from disrupted stars, are facts\r\nthat cannot be ignored. The nebulae with a continuous spectrum, and\r\ntherefore--in part, at least--in a liquid or solid condition, may very\r\nwell be regarded as a more advanced stage of condensation of the same;\r\ntheir spiral shape and conspicuous nuclei are consistent with this.\r\nMoreover, a condensing swarm of meteors would, owing to the heat\r\nevolved, tend to pass into a gaseous condition. On the tether hand, a\r\nhuge expanse of gas stretched over billions of miles of space would be\r\na net for the wandering particles, meteors, and comets that roam\r\nthrough space. If it be true, as is calculated, that our 24,000 miles\r\nof atmosphere capture a hundred million meteors a day, what would the\r\nmillions or billions of times larger net of a nebula catch, even if the\r\ngas is so much thinner? In other words, it is not wise to draw too fine\r\na line between a gaseous nebula and one consisting of solid particles\r\nwith gas.\r\n\r\nThe more important question is: How do astronomers conceive the\r\ncondensation of this mixed mass of cosmic dust? It is easy to reply that\r\ngravitation, or the pressure of the surrounding ether, slowly drives the\r\nparticles centre-ward, and compresses the dust into globes, as the boy\r\nsqueezes the flocculent snow into balls; and it is not difficult for the\r\nmathematician to show that this condensation would account for the\r\nshape and temperature of the stars. But we must go a little beyond this\r\nsuperficial statement, and see, to some extent, how the deeper students\r\nwork out the process. [*]\r\n\r\n     * See, especially, Dr. P. Lowell, \"The Evolution of Worlds\"\r\n     (1909). Professor S. Arrhenius, \"Worlds in the Making\"\r\n     (1908), Sir N. Lockyer, \"The Meteorite Hypothesis\" (1890),\r\n     Sir R. Ball, \"The Earth's Beginning\" (1909), Professor\r\n     Moulton, \"The Astrophysical Journal (October, 1905), and\r\n     Chamberlin and Salisbury, \"Geology,\" Vol. II. (1903).\r\n\r\n\r\nTaking a broad view of the whole field, one may say that the two chief\r\ndifficulties are as follows: First, how to get the whole chaotic mass\r\nwhirling round in one common direction; secondly, how to account for the\r\nfact that in our solar system the outermost planets and satellites do\r\nnot rotate in the same direction as the rest. There is a widespread idea\r\nthat these difficulties have proved fatal to the old nebular hypothesis,\r\nand there are distinguished astronomers who think so. But Sir R. Ball\r\n(see note), Professor Lowell (see note), Professor Pickering (Annals of\r\nHarvard College Observatory, 53, III), and other high authorities deny\r\nthis, and work out the newly discovered movements on the lines of the\r\nold theory. They hold that all the bodies in the solar system once\r\nturned in the same direction as Uranus and Neptune, and the tidal\r\ninfluence of the sun has changed the rotation of most of them. The\r\nplanets farthest from the sun would naturally not be so much affected\r\nby it. The same principle would explain the retrograde movement of the\r\nouter satellites of Saturn and Jupiter. Sir R. Ball further works out\r\nthe principles on which the particles of the condensing nebula would\r\ntend to form a disk rotating on its central axis. The ring-theory of\r\nLaplace is practically abandoned. The spiral nebula is evidently the\r\nstandard type, and the condensing nebula must conform to it. In this\r\nwe are greatly helped by the current theory of the origin of spiral\r\nnebulae.\r\n\r\nWe saw previously that new stars sometimes appear in the sky, and the\r\nrecent closer scrutiny of the heavens shows this occurrence to be fairly\r\nfrequent. It is still held by a few astronomers that such a cataclysm\r\nmeans that two stars collided. Even a partial or \"grazing\" collision\r\nbetween two masses, each weighing billions of tons, travelling (on the\r\naverage) forty or fifty miles a second--a movement that would increase\r\nenormously as they approach each other--would certainly liquefy or\r\nvaporise their substance; but the astronomer, accustomed to see cosmic\r\nbodies escape each other by increasing their speed, is generally\r\ndisinclined to believe in collisions. Some have made the new star plunge\r\ninto the heart of a dense and dark nebula; some have imagined a shock of\r\ntwo gigantic swarms of meteors; some have regarded the outflame as the\r\neffect of a prodigious explosion. In one or other new star each or any\r\nof these things may have occurred, but the most plausible and accepted\r\ntheory for the new star of 1901 and some others is that two stars had\r\napproached each other too closely in their wandering. Suppose that,\r\nin millions of years to come, when our sun is extinct and a firm crust\r\nsurrounds the great molten ball, some other sun approaches within a few\r\nmillion miles of it. The two would rush past each other at a terrific\r\nspeed, but the gravitational effect of the approaching star would tear\r\nopen the solid shell of the sun, and, in a mighty flame, its molten and\r\ngaseous entrails would be flung out into space. It has long been one\r\nof the arguments against a molten interior of the earth that the sun's\r\ngravitational influence would raise it in gigantic tides and rend the\r\nsolid shell of rock. It is even suspected now that our small earth\r\nis not without a tidal influence on the sun. The comparatively near\r\napproach of two suns would lead to a terrific cataclysm.\r\n\r\nIf we accept this theory, the origin of the spiral nebula becomes\r\nintelligible. As the sun from which it is formed is already rotating\r\non its axis, we get a rotation of the nebula from the first. The mass\r\npoured out from the body of the sun would, even if it were only a small\r\nfraction of its mass, suffice to make a planetary system; all our sun's\r\nplanets and their satellites taken together amount to only 1/100th of\r\nthe mass of the solar system. We may assume, further, that the outpoured\r\nmatter would be a mixed cloud of gases and solid and liquid particles;\r\nand that it would stream out, possibly in successive waves, from more\r\nthan one part of the disrupted sun, tending to form great spiral trails\r\nround the parent mass. Some astronomers even suggest that, as there are\r\ntidal waves raised by the moon at opposite points of the earth, similar\r\ntidal outbursts would occur at opposite points on the disk of the\r\ndisrupted star, and thus give rise to the characteristic arms starting\r\nfrom opposite sides of the spiral nebula. This is not at all clear,\r\nas the two tidal waves of the earth are due to the fact that it has a\r\nliquid ocean rolling on, not under, a solid bed.\r\n\r\nIn any case, we have here a good suggestion of the origin of the spiral\r\nnebula and of its further development. As soon as the outbursts are\r\nover, and the scattered particles have reached the farthest limit to\r\nwhich they are hurled, the concentrating action of gravitation will\r\nslowly assert itself. If we conceive this gravitational influence as the\r\npressure of the surrounding ether we get a wider understanding of the\r\nprocess. Much of the dispersed matter may have been shot far enough into\r\nspace to escape the gravitational pull of the parent mass, and will be\r\nadded to the sum of scattered cosmic dust, meteors, and close shoals\r\nof meteors (comets) wandering in space. Much of the rest will fall\r\nback upon the central body But in the great spiral arms themselves the\r\ndistribution of the matter will be irregular, and the denser areas will\r\nslowly gather in the surrounding material. In the end we would thus get\r\nsecondary spheres circling round a large primary.\r\n\r\nThis is the way in which astronomers now generally conceive the\r\ndestruction and re-formation of worlds. On one point the new\r\nplanetesimal theory differs from the other theories. It supposes that,\r\nsince the particles of the whirling nebula are all travelling in the\r\nsame general direction, they overtake each other with less violent\r\nimpact than the other theories suppose, and therefore the condensation\r\nof the material into planets would not give rise to the terrific heat\r\nwhich is generally assumed. We will consider this in the next chapter,\r\nwhen we deal with the formation of the planets. As far as the central\r\nbody, the sun, is concerned, there can be no hesitation. The 500,000,000\r\nincandescent suns in the heavens are eloquent proof of the appalling\r\nheat that is engendered by the collisions of the concentrating\r\nparticles.\r\n\r\nIn general outline we now follow the story of a star with some\r\nconfidence. An internal explosion, a fatal rush into some dense nebula\r\nor swarm of meteors, a collision with another star, or an approach\r\nwithin a few million miles of another star, scatters, in part or whole,\r\nthe solid or liquid globe in a cloud of cosmic dust. When the violent\r\noutrush is over, the dust is gathered together once more into a star. At\r\nfirst cold and attenuated, its temperature rises as the particles come\r\ntogether, and we have, after a time, an incandescent nucleus shining\r\nthrough a thin veil of gas--a nebulous star. The temperature rises still\r\nfurther, and we have the blue-hot star, in which the elements seem to\r\nbe dissociated, and slowly re-forming as the temperature falls. After,\r\nperhaps, hundreds of millions of years it reaches the \"yellow\" stage,\r\nand, if it has planets with the conditions of life, there may be a\r\ntemporary opportunity for living things to enjoy its tempered energy.\r\nBut the cooler vapours are gathering round it, and at length its\r\nluminous body is wholly imprisoned. It continues its terrific course\r\nthrough space, until some day, perhaps, it again encounters the mighty\r\ncataclysm which will make it begin afresh the long and stormy chapters\r\nof its living history.\r\n\r\nSuch is the suggestion of the modern astronomer, and, although we seem\r\nto find every phase of the theory embodied in the varied contents of\r\nthe heavens, we must not forget that it is only a suggestion. The\r\nspectroscope and telescopic photography, which are far more important\r\nthan the visual telescope, are comparatively recent, and the field to be\r\nexplored is enormous. The mist is lifting from the cosmic landscape, but\r\nthere is still enough to blur our vision. Very puzzling questions remain\r\nunanswered. What is the origin of the great gaseous nebulae? What is\r\nthe origin of the triple or quadruple star? What is the meaning of stars\r\nwhose light ebbs and flows in periods of from a few to several hundred\r\ndays? We may even point to the fact that some, at least, of the spiral\r\nnebulae are far too vast to be the outcome of the impact or approach of\r\ntwo stars.\r\n\r\nWe may be content to think that we have found out some truths, by no\r\nmeans the whole truth, about the evolution of worlds. Throughout this\r\nimmeasurable ocean of ether the particles of matter are driven together\r\nand form bodies. These bodies swarm throughout space, like fish in the\r\nsea; travelling singly (the \"shooting star\"), or in great close shoals\r\n(the nucleus of a comet), or lying scattered in vast clouds. But the\r\ninexorable pressure urges them still, until billions of tons of\r\nmaterial are gathered together. Then, either from the sheer heat of the\r\ncompression, or from the formation of large and unstable atomic systems\r\n(radium, etc.), or both, the great mass becomes a cauldron of fire,\r\nmantled in its own vapours, and the story of a star is run. It dies out\r\nin one part of space to begin afresh in another. We see nothing in\r\nthe nature of a beginning or an end for the totality of worlds, the\r\nuniverse. The life of all living things on the earth, from the formation\r\nof the primitive microbes to the last struggles of the superman, is a\r\nsmall episode of that stupendous drama, a fraction of a single scene.\r\nBut our ampler knowledge of it, and our personal interest in it, magnify\r\nthat episode, and we turn from the cosmic picture to study the formation\r\nof the earth and the rise of its living population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. THE PREPARATION OF THE EARTH\r\n\r\nThe story of the evolution of our solar system is, it will now be seen,\r\na local instance of the great cosmic process we have studied in the last\r\nchapter. We may take one of the small spiral nebulae that abound in the\r\nheavens as an illustration of the first stage. If a still earlier stage\r\nis demanded, we may suppose that some previous sun collided with, or\r\napproached too closely, another mighty body, and belched out a large\r\npart of its contents in mighty volcanic outpours. Mathematical reasoning\r\ncan show that this erupted material would gather into a spiral nebula;\r\nbut, as mathematical calculations cannot be given here, and are less\r\nsafe than astronomical facts, we will be content to see the early shape\r\nof our solar system in a relatively small spiral nebula, its outermost\r\narm stretching far beyond the present orbit of Neptune, and its great\r\nnucleus being our present sun in more diffused form.\r\n\r\nWe need not now attempt to follow the shrinking of the central part of\r\nthe nebula until it becomes a rounded fiery sun. That has been done in\r\ntracing the evolution of a star. Here we have to learn how the planets\r\nwere formed from the spiral arms of the nebula. The principle of their\r\nformation is already clear. The same force of gravitation, or the same\r\npressure of the surrounding ether, which compresses the central mass\r\ninto a fiery globe, will act upon the loose material of the arms and\r\ncompress it into smaller globes. But there is an interesting and acute\r\ndifference of opinion amongst modern experts as to whether these smaller\r\nglobes, the early planets, would become white-hot bodies.\r\n\r\nThe general opinion, especially among astronomers, is that the\r\ncompression of the nebulous material of the arms into globes would\r\ngenerate enormous heat, as in the case of the sun. On that view the\r\nvarious planets would begin their careers as small suns, and would pass\r\nthrough those stages of cooling and shrinking which we have traced in\r\nthe story of the stars. A glance at the photograph of one of the spiral\r\nnebulae strongly confirms this. Great luminous knots, or nuclei, are\r\nseen at intervals in the arms. Smaller suns seem to be forming in them,\r\neach gathering into its body the neighbouring material of the arm,\r\nand rising in temperature as the mass is compressed into a globe. The\r\nspectroscope shows that these knots are condensing masses of white-hot\r\nliquid or solid matter. It therefore seems plain that each planet will\r\nfirst become a liquid globe of fire, coursing round the central sun, and\r\nwill gradually, as its heat is dissipated and the supply begins to fail,\r\nform a solid crust.\r\n\r\nThis familiar view is challenged by the new \"planetesimal hypothesis,\"\r\nwhich has been adopted by many distinguished geologists (Chamberlin,\r\nGregory, Coleman, etc.). In their view the particles in the arms of\r\nthe nebula are all moving in the same direction round the sun. They\r\ntherefore quietly overtake the nucleus to which they are attracted,\r\ninstead of violently colliding with each other, and much less heat\r\nis generated at the surface. In that case the planets would not pass\r\nthrough a white-hot, or even red-hot, stage at all. They are formed by\r\na slow ingathering of the scattered particles, which are called\r\n\"planetesimals\" round the larger or denser masses of stuff which were\r\ndischarged by the exploding sun. Possibly these masses were prevented\r\nfrom falling back into the sun by the attraction of the colliding body,\r\nor the body which caused the eruption. They would revolve round the\r\nparent body, and the shoals of smaller particles would gather about them\r\nby gravitation. If there were any large region in the arm of the nebula\r\nwhich had no single massive nucleus, the cosmic dust would gather about\r\na number of smaller centres. Thus might be explained the hundreds of\r\nplanetoids, or minor planets, which we find between Mars and Jupiter. If\r\nthese smaller bodies came within the sphere of influence of one of\r\nthe larger planets, yet were travelling quickly enough to resist its\r\nattraction, they would be compelled to revolve round it, and we could\r\nthus explain the ten satellites of Saturn and the eight of Jupiter. Our\r\nmoon, we shall see, had a different origin.\r\n\r\nWe shall find this new hypothesis crossing the familiar lines at\r\nmany points in the next few chapters. We will consider those further\r\nconsequences as they arise, but may say at once that, while the new\r\ntheory has greatly helped us in tracing the formation of the planetary\r\nsystem, astronomers are strongly opposed to its claim that the planets\r\ndid not pass through an incandescent stage. The actual features of our\r\nspiral nebulae seem clearly to exhibit that stage. The shape of the\r\nplanets--globular bodies, flattened at the poles--strongly suggests that\r\nthey were once liquid. The condition in which we find Saturn and Jupiter\r\nvery forcibly confirms this suggestion; the latest study of those\r\nplanets supports the current opinion that they are still red-hot, and\r\neven seems to detect the glow of their surfaces in their mantles of\r\ncloud. These points will be considered more fully presently. For\r\nthe moment it is enough to note that, as far as the early stages of\r\nplanetary development are concerned, the generally accepted theory\r\nrests on a mass of positive evidence, while the new hypothesis is\r\npurely theoretical. We therefore follow the prevailing view with some\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nThose of the spiral nebulae which face the earth squarely afford an\r\nexcellent suggestion of the way in which planets are probably formed. In\r\nsome of these nebulae the arms consist of almost continuous streams\r\nof faintly luminous matter; in others the matter is gathering about\r\ndistinct centres; in others again the nebulous matter is, for the most\r\npart, collected in large glowing spheres. They seem to be successive\r\nstages, and to reveal to us the origin of our planets. The position\r\nof each planet in our solar system would be determined by the chance\r\nposition of the denser stuff shot out by the erupting sun. I have seen\r\nVesuvius hurl up into the sky, amongst its blasts of gas and steam,\r\nwhite-hot masses of rock weighing fifty tons. In the far fiercer\r\noutburst of the erupting sun there would be at least thinner and denser\r\nmasses, and they must have been hurled so far into space that their\r\nspeed in travelling round the central body, perhaps seconded by the\r\nattraction of the second star, overcame the gravitational pull back to\r\nthe centre. Recollect the force which, in the new star in Perseus, drove\r\nmasses of hydrogen for millions of miles at a speed of a thousand miles\r\na second.\r\n\r\nThese denser nuclei or masses would, when the eruption was over, begin\r\nto attract to themselves all the lighter nebulous material within their\r\nsphere of gravitational influence. Naturally, there would at first be a\r\nvast confusion of small and large centres of condensation in the arms\r\nof the nebula, moving in various directions, but a kind of natural\r\nselection--and, in this case, survival of the biggest--would ensue. The\r\nconflicting movements would be adjusted by collisions and gravitation,\r\nthe smaller bodies would be absorbed in the larger or enslaved as\r\ntheir satellites, and the last state would be a family of smaller suns\r\ncircling at vast distances round the parent body. The planets, moreover,\r\nwould be caused to rotate on their axes, besides revolving round the\r\nsun, as the particles at their inner edge (nearer the sun) would move\r\nat a different speed from those at the outer edge. In the course of time\r\nthe smaller bodies, having less heat to lose and less (or no) atmosphere\r\nto check the loss, would cool down, and become dark solid spheres, lit\r\nonly by the central fire.\r\n\r\nWhile the first stage of this theory of development is seen in the\r\nspiral nebula, the later stages seem to be well exemplified in the\r\nactual condition of our planets. Following, chiefly, the latest research\r\nof Professor Lowell and his colleagues, which marks a considerable\r\nadvance on our previous knowledge, we shall find it useful to glance at\r\nthe sister-planets before we approach the particular story of our earth.\r\n\r\nMercury, the innermost and smallest of the planets, measuring only some\r\n3400 miles in diameter, is, not unexpectedly, an airless wilderness.\r\nSmall bodies are unable to retain the gases at their surface, on account\r\nof their feebler gravitation. We find, moreover, that Mercury always\r\npresents the same face to the sun, as it turns on its axis in the same\r\nperiod (eighty-eight days) in which it makes a revolution round the sun.\r\nWhile, therefore, one half of the globe is buried in eternal darkness,\r\nthe other half is eternally exposed to the direct and blistering rays\r\nof the sun, which is only 86,000,000 miles away. To Professor Lowell it\r\npresents the appearance of a bleached and sun-cracked desert, or \"the\r\nbones of a dead world.\" Its temperature must be at least 300 degrees C.\r\nabove that of the earth. Its features are what we should expect on the\r\nnebular hypothesis. The slowness of its rotation is accounted for by\r\nthe heavy tidal influence of the sun. In the same way our moon has been\r\ninfluenced by the earth, and our earth by the sun, in their movement of\r\nrotation.\r\n\r\nVenus, as might be expected in the case of so large a globe (nearly\r\nas large as the earth), has an atmosphere, but it seems, like Mercury,\r\nalways to present the same face to the sun. Its comparative nearness\r\nto the sun (67,000,000 miles) probably explains this advanced effect of\r\ntidal action. The consequences that the observers deduce from the fact\r\nare interesting. The sun-baked half of Venus seems to be devoid of water\r\nor vapour, and it is thought that all its water is gathered into a rigid\r\nice-field on the dark side of the globe, from which fierce hurricanes\r\nmust blow incessantly. It is a Sahara, or a desert far hotter than the\r\nSahara, on one side; an arctic region on the other. It does not seem\r\nto be a world fitted for the support of any kind of life that we can\r\nimagine.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the consideration of Mars, we enter a world of unending\r\ncontroversy. With little more than half the diameter of the earth, Mars\r\nought to be in a far more advanced stage of either life or decay, but\r\nits condition has not yet been established. Some hold that it has a\r\nconsiderable atmosphere; others that it is too small a globe to\r\nhave retained a layer of gas. Professor Poynting believes that its\r\ntemperature is below the freezing-point of water all over the globe;\r\nmany others, if not the majority of observers, hold that the white cap\r\nwe see at its poles is a mass of ice and snow, or at least a thick coat\r\nof hoar-frost, and that it melts at the edges as the springtime of Mars\r\ncomes round. In regard to its famous canals we are no nearer agreement.\r\nSome maintain that the markings are not really an objective feature;\r\nsome hold that they are due to volcanic activity, and that similar\r\nmarkings are found on the moon; some believe that they are due to\r\nclouds; while Professor Lowell and others stoutly adhere to the familiar\r\nview that they are artificial canals, or the strips of vegetation along\r\nsuch canals. The question of the actual habitation of Mars is still\r\nopen. We can say only that there is strong evidence of its possession of\r\nthe conditions of life in some degree, and that living things, even on\r\nthe earth, display a remarkable power of adaptation to widely differing\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nPassing over the 700 planetoids, which circulate between Mars and\r\nJupiter, and for which we may account either by the absence of one\r\nlarge nucleus in that part of the nebulous stream or by the disturbing\r\ninfluence of Jupiter, we come to the largest planet of the system. Here\r\nwe find a surprising confirmation of the theory of planetary development\r\nwhich we are following. Three hundred times heavier than the earth\r\n(or more than a trillion tons in weight), yet a thousand times less\r\nin volume than the sun, Jupiter ought, if our theory is correct, to be\r\nstill red-hot. All the evidence conspires to suggest that it is. It has\r\nlong been recognised that the shining disk of the planet is not a solid,\r\nbut a cloud, surface. This impenetrable mass of cloud or vapour is drawn\r\nout in streams or belts from side to side, as the giant globe turns on\r\nits axis once in every ten hours. We cannot say if, or to what extent,\r\nthese clouds consist of water-vapour. We can conclude only that this\r\nmantle of Jupiter is \"a seething cauldron of vapours\" (Lowell), and\r\nthat, if the body beneath is solid, it must be very hot. A large red\r\narea, at one time 30,000 miles long, has more or less persisted on the\r\nsurface for several decades, and it is generally interpreted, either as\r\na red-hot surface, or as a vast volcanic vent, reflecting its glow upon\r\nthe clouds. Indeed, the keen American observers, with their powerful\r\ntelescopes, have detected a cherry-red glow on the edges of the\r\ncloud-belts across the disk; and more recent observation with the\r\nspectroscope seems to prove that Jupiter emits light from its surface\r\nanalogous to that of the red stars. The conspicuous flattening of its\r\npoles is another feature that science would expect in a rapidly rotating\r\nliquid globe. In a word, Jupiter seems to be in the last stage of\r\nstellar development. Such, at some remote time, was our earth; such one\r\nday will be the sun.\r\n\r\nThe neighbouring planet Saturn supports the conclusion. Here again we\r\nhave a gigantic globe, 28,000 miles in diameter, turning on its axis\r\nin the short space of ten hours; and here again we find the conspicuous\r\nflattening of the poles, the trailing belts of massed vapour across\r\nthe disk, the red glow lighting the edges of the belts, and the\r\nspectroscopic evidence of an emission of light. Once more it is\r\ndifficult to doubt that a highly heated body is wrapped in that thick\r\nmantle of vapour. With its ten moons and its marvellous ring-system--an\r\nenormous collection of fragments, which the influence of the planet\r\nor of its nearer satellites seems to have prevented from\r\nconcentrating--Saturn has always been a beautiful object to observe; it\r\nis not less interesting in those features which we faintly detect in its\r\ndisk.\r\n\r\nThe next planet, Uranus, 32,000 miles in diameter, seems to be another\r\ncloud-wrapt, greatly heated globe, if not, as some think, a sheer mass\r\nof vapours without a liquid core. Neptune is too dim and distant for\r\nprofitable examination. It may be added, however, that the dense masses\r\nof gas which are found to surround the outer planets seem to confirm the\r\nnebular theory, which assumes that they were developed in the outer and\r\nlighter part of the material hurled from the sun.\r\n\r\nFrom this encouraging survey of the sister-planets we return with more\r\nconfidence to the story of the earth. I will not attempt to follow\r\nan imaginative scheme in regard to its early development. Take four\r\nphotographs--one of a spiral nebula without knots in its arms, one of\r\na nebula like that in Canes Venatici, one of the sun, and one of\r\nJupiter--and you have an excellent illustration of the chief stages in\r\nits formation. In the first picture a section of the luminous arm of the\r\nnebula stretches thinly across millions of miles of space. In the next\r\nstage this material is largely collected in a luminous and hazy sphere,\r\nas we find in the nebula in Canes Venatici. The sun serves to illustrate\r\na further stage in the condensation of this sphere. Jupiter represents\r\na later chapter, in which the cooler vapours are wrapped close about the\r\nred-hot body of the planet. That seems to have been the early story of\r\nthe earth. Some 6,000,000,000 billion tons of the nebulous matter were\r\nattracted to a common centre. As the particles pressed centreward, the\r\ntemperature rose, and for a time the generation of heat was greater than\r\nits dissipation. Whether the earth ever shone as a small white star we\r\ncannot say. We must not hastily conclude that such a relatively small\r\nmass would behave like the far greater mass of a star, but we may,\r\nwithout attempting to determine its temperature, assume that it runs an\r\nanalogous course.\r\n\r\nOne of the many features which I have indicated as pointing to a former\r\nfluidity of the earth may be explained here. We shall see in the course\r\nof this work that the mountain chains and other great irregularities of\r\nthe earth's surface appear at a late stage in its development. Even\r\nas we find them to-day, they are seen to be merely slight ridges and\r\nfurrows on the face of the globe, when we reflect on its enormous\r\ndiameter, but there is good reason to think that in the beginning the\r\nearth was much nearer to a perfectly globular form. This points to\r\na liquid or gaseous condition at one time, and the flattening of the\r\nsphere at the poles confirms the impression. We should hardly expect\r\nso perfect a rotundity in a body formed by the cool accretion of solid\r\nfragments and particles. It is just what we should expect in a fluid\r\nbody, and the later irregularities of the surface are accounted for by\r\nthe constant crumpling and wearing of its solid crust. Many would find\r\na confirmation of this in the phenomena of volcanoes, geysers, and\r\nearthquakes, and the increase of the temperature as we descend the\r\ncrust. But the interior condition of the earth, and the nature of these\r\nphenomena, are much disputed at present, and it is better not to rely on\r\nany theory of them. It is suggested that radium may be responsible for\r\nthis subterraneous heat.\r\n\r\nThe next stage in the formation of the earth is necessarily one that we\r\ncan reach only by conjecture. Over the globe of molten fire the vapours\r\nand gases would be suspended like a heavy canopy, as we find in Jupiter\r\nand Saturn to-day. When the period of maximum heat production was\r\npassed, however, the radiation into space would cause a lowering of\r\nthe temperature, and a scum would form on the molten surface. As may be\r\nobserved on the surface of any cooling vessel of fluid, the scum would\r\nstretch and crack; the skin would, so to say, prove too small for the\r\nbody. The molten ocean below would surge through the crust, and bury it\r\nunder floods of lava. Some hold that the slabs would sink in the ocean\r\nof metal, and thus the earth would first solidify in its deeper layers.\r\nThere would, in any case, be an age-long struggle between the molten\r\nmass and the confining crust, until at length--to employ the old Roman\r\nconception of the activity of Etna--the giant was imprisoned below the\r\nheavy roof of rock.\r\n\r\nHere again we seem to find evidence of the general correctness of the\r\ntheory. The objection has been raised that the geologist does not find\r\nany rocks which he can identify as portions of the primitive crust\r\nof the earth. It seems to me that it would be too much to expect the\r\nsurvival at the surface of any part of the first scum that cooled on\r\nthat fiery ocean. It is more natural to suppose that millions of years\r\nof volcanic activity on a prodigious scale would characterise this\r\nearly stage, and the \"primitive crust\" would be buried in fragments, or\r\ndissolved again, under deep seas of lava. Now, this is precisely what we\r\nfind, The oldest rocks known to the geologist--the Archaean rocks--are\r\noverwhelmingly volcanic, especially in their lower part. Their\r\nthickness, as we know them, is estimated at 50,000 feet; a thickness\r\nwhich must represent many millions of years. But we do not know how much\r\nthicker than this they may be. They underlie the oldest rocks that have\r\never been exposed to the gaze of the geologist. They include sedimentary\r\ndeposits, showing the action of water, and even probable traces of\r\norganic remains, but they are, especially in their deeper and older\r\nsections, predominantly volcanic. They evince what we may call a\r\nvolcanic age in the early story of the planet.\r\n\r\nBut before we pursue this part of the story further we must interpolate\r\na remarkable event in the record--the birth of the moon. It is now\r\ngenerally believed, on a theory elaborated by Sir G. Darwin, that when\r\nthe formation of the crust had reached a certain depth--something over\r\nthirty miles, it is calculated--it parted with a mass of matter, which\r\nbecame the moon. The size of our moon, in comparison with the earth,\r\nis so exceptional among the satellites which attend the planets of our\r\nsolar system that it is assigned an exceptional origin. It is calculated\r\nthat at that time the earth turned on its axis in the space of four or\r\nfive hours, instead of twenty-four. We have already seen that the tidal\r\ninfluence of the sun has the effect of moderating the rotation of the\r\nplanets. Now, this very rapid rotation of a liquid mass, with a thin\r\ncrust, would (together with the instability occasioned by its cooling)\r\ncause it to bulge at the equator. The bulge would increase until the\r\nearth became a pear-shaped body. The small end of the pear would draw\r\nfurther and further away from the rest--as a drop of water does on the\r\nmouth of a tap--and at last the whole mass (some 5,000,000,000 cubic\r\nmiles of matter) was broken off, and began to pursue an independent\r\norbit round the earth.\r\n\r\nThere are astronomers who think that other cosmic bodies, besides our\r\nmoon, may have been formed in this way. Possibly it is true of some of\r\nthe double stars, but we will not return to that question. The further\r\nstory of the moon, as it is known to astronomers, may be given in a few\r\nwords. The rotational movement of the earth is becoming gradually slower\r\non account of tidal influence; our day, in fact, becomes an hour longer\r\nevery few million years. It can be shown that this had the effect of\r\nincreasing the speed, and therefore enlarging the orbit, of the moon,\r\nas it revolved round the earth. As a result, the moon drew further and\r\nfurther away from the earth until it reached its present position, about\r\n240,000 miles away. At the same time the tidal influence of the earth\r\nwas lessening the rotational movement of the moon. This went on until\r\nit turned on its axis in the same period in which it revolves round\r\nthe earth, and on this account it always presents the same face to the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThrough what chapters of life the moon may have passed in the meantime\r\nit is impossible to say. Its relatively small mass may have been unable\r\nto keep the lighter gases at its surface, or its air and water may, as\r\nsome think, have been absorbed. It is to-day practically an airless and\r\nwaterless desert, alternating between the heat of its long day and the\r\nintense cold of its long night. Careful observers, such as Professor\r\nPickering, think that it may still have a shallow layer of heavy gases\r\nat its surface, and that this may permit the growth of some stunted\r\nvegetation during the day. Certain changes of colour, which are observed\r\non its surface, have been interpreted in that sense. We can hardly\r\nconceive any other kind of life on it. In the dark even the gases will\r\nfreeze on its surface, as there is no atmosphere to retain the heat.\r\nIndeed, some students of the moon (Fauth, etc.) believe that it is an\r\nunchanging desert of ice, bombarded by the projectiles of space.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious speculation as to the effect on the earth of this\r\ndislodgment of 5,000,000,000 cubic miles of its substance is worth\r\nnoting. It supposes that the bed of the Pacific Ocean represents the\r\nenormous gap torn in its side by the delivery of the moon. At each side\r\nof this chasm the two continents, the Old World and the New, would\r\nbe left floating on their molten ocean; and some have even seen a\r\nconfirmation of this in the lines of crustal weakness which we trace, by\r\nvolcanoes and earthquakes, on either side of the Pacific. Others, again,\r\nconnect the shape of our great masses of land, which generally run to\r\na southern point, with this early catastrophe. But these interesting\r\nspeculations have a very slender basis, and we will return to the story\r\nof the development of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe last phase in preparation for the appearance of life would be the\r\nformation of the ocean. On the lines of the generally received nebular\r\nhypothesis this can easily be imagined, in broad outline. The gases\r\nwould form the outer shell of the forming planet, since the heavier\r\nparticles would travel inward. In this mixed mass of gas the oxygen and\r\nhydrogen would combine, at a fitting temperature, and form water.\r\nFor ages the molten crust would hold this water suspended aloft as a\r\nsurrounding shell of cloud, but when the surface cooled to about 380\r\ndegrees C. (Sollas), the liquid would begin to pour on it. A period of\r\nconflict would ensue, the still heated crust and the frequent volcanic\r\noutpours sending the water back in hissing steam to the clouds. At\r\nlength, and now more rapidly, the temperature of the crust would sink\r\nstill lower, and a heated ocean would settle upon it, filling the\r\nhollows of its irregular surface, and washing the bases of its\r\noutstanding ridges. From that time begins the age-long battle of the\r\nland and the water which, we shall see, has had a profound influence on\r\nthe development of life.\r\n\r\nIn deference to the opinion of a number of geologists we must glance\r\nonce more at the alternative view of the planetesimal school. In their\r\nopinion the molecules of water were partly attracted to the surface out\r\nof the disrupted matter, and partly collected within the porous outer\r\nlayers of the globe. As the latter quantity grew, it would ooze upwards,\r\nfill the smaller depressions in the crust, and at length, with the\r\naddition of the attracted water, spread over the irregular surface.\r\nThere is an even more important difference of opinion in regard to the\r\nformation of the atmosphere, but we may defer this until the question\r\nof climate interests us. We have now made our globe, and will pass on\r\nto that early chapter of its story in which living things make their\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nTo some it will seem that we ought not to pass from the question of\r\norigin without a word on the subject of the age of the earth. All that\r\none can do, however, is to give a number of very divergent estimates.\r\nPhysicists have tried to calculate the age of the sun from the rate\r\nof its dissipation of heat, and have assigned, at the most, a hundred\r\nmillion years to our solar system; but the recent discovery of a source\r\nof heat in the disintegration of such metals as radium has made their\r\ncalculations useless. Geologists have endeavoured, from observation of\r\nthe action of geological agencies to-day, to estimate how long it will\r\nhave taken them to form the stratified crust of the earth; but even the\r\nbest estimates vary between twenty-five and a hundred million years, and\r\nwe have reason to think that the intensity of these geological agencies\r\nmay have varied in different ages. Chemists have calculated how long it\r\nwould take the ocean, which was originally fresh water, to take up from\r\nthe rocks and rivers the salt which it contains to-day; Professor Joly\r\nhas on this ground assigned a hundred million years since the waters\r\nfirst descended upon the crust. We must be content to know that the\r\nbest recent estimates, based on positive data, vary between fifty and a\r\nhundred million years for the story which we are now about to narrate.\r\nThe earlier or astronomical period remains quite incalculable. Sir G.\r\nDarwin thinks that it was probably at least a thousand million years\r\nsince the moon was separated from the earth. Whatever the period of time\r\nmay be since some cosmic cataclysm scattered the material of our solar\r\nsystem in the form of a nebula, it is only a fraction of that larger and\r\nillimitable time which the evolution of the stars dimly suggests to the\r\nscientific imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GEOLOGICAL SERIES\r\n\r\n[The scale of years adopted--50,000,000 for the stratified rocks--is\r\nmerely an intermediate between conflicting estimates.]\r\n\r\n     ERA.

THE BEGINNING OF LIFE\r\n\r\nThere is, perhaps, no other chapter in the chronicle of the earth that\r\nwe approach with so lively an interest as the chapter which should\r\nrecord the first appearance of life. Unfortunately, as far as the\r\nauthentic memorials of the past go, no other chapter is so impenetrably\r\nobscure as this. The reason is simple. It is a familiar saying that life\r\nhas written its own record, the long-drawn record of its dynasties and\r\nits deaths, in the rocks. But there were millions of years during which\r\nlife had not yet learned to write its record, and further millions of\r\nyears the record of which has been irremediably destroyed. The first\r\nvolume of the geological chronicle of the earth is the mass of the\r\nArchaean (or \"primitive\") rocks. What the actual magnitude of that\r\nvolume, and the span of time it covers, may be, no geologist can say.\r\nThe Archaean rocks still solidly underlie the lowest depth he has ever\r\nreached. It is computed, however, that these rocks, as far as they are\r\nknown to us, have a total depth of nearly ten miles, and seem therefore\r\nto represent at least half the story of the earth from the time when it\r\nrounded into a globe, or cooled sufficiently to endure the presence of\r\noceans.\r\n\r\nYet all that we read of the earth's story during those many millions of\r\nyears could be told in a page or two. That section of geology is still\r\nin its infancy, it is true. A day may come when science will decipher a\r\nlong and instructive narrative in the masses of quartz and gneiss, and\r\nthe layers of various kinds, which it calls the Archaean rocks. But we\r\nmay say with confidence that it will not discover in them more than\r\na few stray syllables of the earlier part, and none whatever of the\r\nearliest part, of the epic of living nature. A few fossilised remains of\r\nsomewhat advanced organisms, such as shell-fish and worms, are found\r\nin the higher and later rocks of the series, and more of the same\r\ncomparatively high types will probably appear. In the earlier strata,\r\nrepresenting an earlier stage of life, we find only thick seams of black\r\nshale, limestone, and ironstone, in which we seem to see the ashes of\r\nprimitive organisms, cremated in the appalling fires of the volcanic\r\nage, or crushed out of recognition by the superimposed masses. Even if\r\nsome wizardry of science were ever to restore the forms that have been\r\nreduced to ashes in this Archaean crematorium, it would be found that\r\nthey are more or less advanced forms, far above the original level of\r\nlife. No trace will ever be found in the rocks of the first few million\r\nyears in the calendar of life.\r\n\r\nThe word impossible or unknowable is not lightly uttered in science\r\nto-day, but there is a very plain reason for admitting it here. The\r\nearliest living things were at least as primitive of nature as the\r\nlowest animals and plants we know to-day, and these, up to a fair level\r\nof organisation, are so soft of texture that, when they die, they leave\r\nno remains which may one day be turned into fossils. Some of them,\r\nindeed, form tiny shells of flint or lime, or, like the corals, make for\r\nthemselves a solid bed; but this is a relatively late and higher stage\r\nof development. Many thousands of species of animals and plants lie\r\nbelow that level. We are therefore forced to conclude, from the aspect\r\nof living nature to-day, that for ages the early organisms had no hard\r\nand preservable parts. In thus declaring the impotence of geology,\r\nhowever, we are at the same time introducing another science, biology,\r\nwhich can throw appreciable light on the evolution of life. Let us first\r\nsee what geology tells us about the infancy of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the early rocks suggests that there was\r\ncomparatively little dry land showing above the surface of the Archaean\r\nocean. Our knowledge of these rocks is not at all complete, and we must\r\nremember that some of this primitive land may be now under the sea or\r\nburied in unsuspected regions. It is significant, however, that, up to\r\nthe present, exploration seems to show that in those remote ages only\r\nabout one-fifth of our actual land-surface stood above the level of the\r\nwaters. Apart from a patch of some 20,000 square miles of what is now\r\nAustralia, and smaller patches in Tasmania, New Zealand, and India,\r\nnearly the whole of this land was in the far North. A considerable area\r\nof eastern Canada had emerged, with lesser islands standing out to the\r\nwest and south of North America. Another large area lay round the basin\r\nof the Baltic; and as Greenland, the Hebrides, and the extreme tip of\r\nScotland, belong to the same age, it is believed that a continent, of\r\nwhich they are fragments, united America and Europe across the North\r\nAtlantic. Of the rest of what is now Europe there were merely large\r\nislands--one on the border of England and Wales, others in France,\r\nSpain, and Southern Germany. Asia was represented by a large area in\r\nChina and Siberia, and an island or islands on the site of India. Very\r\nlittle of Africa or South America existed.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen at a glance that the physical story of the earth\r\nfrom that time is a record of the emergence from the waters of larger\r\ncontinents and the formation of lofty chains of mountains. Now this\r\nworld-old battle of land and sea has been waged with varying fortune\r\nfrom age to age, and it has been one of the most important factors\r\nin the development of life. We are just beginning to realise what a\r\nwonderful light it throws on the upward advance of animals and plants.\r\nNo one in the scientific world to-day questions that, however imperfect\r\nthe record may be, there has been a continuous development of life from\r\nthe lowest level to the highest. But why there was advance at all, why\r\nthe primitive microbe climbs the scale of being, during millions\r\nof years, until it reaches the stature of humanity, seems to many a\r\nprofound mystery. The solution of this mystery begins to break upon us\r\nwhen we contemplate, in the geological record, the prolonged series of\r\nchanges in the face of the earth itself, and try to realise how these\r\nchanges must have impelled living things to fresh and higher adaptations\r\nto their changing surroundings.\r\n\r\nImagine some early continent with its population of animals and plants.\r\nEach bay, estuary, river, and lake, each forest and marsh and solid\r\nplain, has its distinctive inhabitants. Imagine this continent slowly\r\nsinking into the sea, until the advancing arms of the salt water meet\r\nacross it, mingling their diverse populations in a common world, making\r\nthe fresh-water lake brackish or salt, turning the dry land into swamp,\r\nand flooding the forest. Or suppose, on the other hand, that the land\r\nrises, the marsh is drained, the genial climate succeeded by an icy\r\ncold, the luscious vegetation destroyed, the whole animal population\r\ncompelled to change its habits and its food. But this is no imaginary\r\npicture. It is the actual story of the earth during millions of years,\r\nand it is chiefly in the light of these vast and exacting changes in the\r\nenvironment that we are going to survey the panorama of the advance of\r\nterrestrial life.\r\n\r\nFor the moment it will be enough to state two leading principles. The\r\nfirst is that there is no such thing as a \"law of evolution\" in\r\nthe sense in which many people understand that phrase. It is now\r\nsufficiently well known that, when science speaks of a law, it does not\r\nmean that there is some rule that things MUST act in such and such a\r\nway. The law is a mere general expression of the fact that they DO act\r\nin that way. But many imagine that there is some principle within\r\nthe living organism which impels it onward to a higher level of\r\norganisation. That is entirely an error. There is no \"law of progress.\"\r\nIf an animal is fitted to secure its livelihood and breed posterity\r\nin certain surroundings, it may remain unchanged indefinitely if these\r\nsurroundings do not materially change. So the duckmole of Australia and\r\nthe tuatara of New Zealand have retained primitive features for millions\r\nof years; so the aboriginal Australian and the Fuegian have remained\r\nstagnant, in their isolation, for a hundred thousand years or more; so\r\nthe Chinaman, in his geographical isolation, has remained unchanged\r\nfor two thousand years. There is no more a \"conservative instinct\"\r\nin Chinese than there is a \"progressive instinct\" in Europeans. The\r\ndifference is one of history and geography, as we shall see.\r\n\r\nTo make this important principle still clearer, let us imagine some\r\nprimitive philosopher observing the advance of the tide over a level\r\nbeach. He must discover two things: why the water comes onward at all,\r\nand why it advances along those particular channels. We shall see later\r\nhow men of science explain or interpret the mechanism in a living thing\r\nwhich enables it to advance, when it does advance. For the present it\r\nis enough to say that new-born animals and plants are always tending to\r\ndiffer somewhat from their parents, and we now know, by experiment, that\r\nwhen some exceptional influence is brought to bear on the parent, the\r\nyoung may differ considerably from her. But, if the parents were already\r\nin harmony with their environment, these variations on the part of the\r\nyoung are of no consequence. Let the environment alter, however, and\r\nsome of these variations may chance to make the young better fitted than\r\nthe parent was. The young which happen to have the useful variation will\r\nhave an advantage over their brothers or sisters, and be more likely to\r\nsurvive and breed the next generation. If the change in the environment\r\n(in the food or climate, for instance) is prolonged and increased for\r\nhundreds of thousands of years, we shall expect to find a corresponding\r\nchange in the animals and plants.\r\n\r\nWe shall find such changes occurring throughout the story of the earth.\r\nAt one important point in the story we shall find so grave a revolution\r\nin the face of nature that twenty-nine out of every thirty species of\r\nanimals and plants on the earth are annihilated. Less destructive and\r\nextreme changes have been taking place during nearly the whole of the\r\nperiod we have to cover, entailing a more gradual alteration of the\r\nstructure of animals and plants; but we shall repeatedly find them\r\nculminating in very great changes of climate, or of the distribution of\r\nland and water, which have subjected the living population of the earth\r\nto the most searching tests and promoted every variation toward a more\r\neffective organisation. [*]\r\n\r\n     * This is a very simple expression of \"Darwinism,\" and will\r\n     be enlarged later. The reader should ignore the occasional\r\n     statement of non-scientific writers that Darwinism is \"dead\"\r\n     or superseded. The questions which are actually in dispute\r\n     relate to the causes of the variation of the young from\r\n     their parents, the magnitude of these variations' and the\r\n     transmission of changes acquired by an animal during its own\r\n     life. We shall see this more fully at a later stage. The\r\n     importance of the environment as I have described it, is\r\n     admitted by all schools.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the second guiding principle I wish to lay down in advance is that\r\nthese great changes in the face of the earth, which explain the progress\r\nof organisms, may very largely be reduced to one simple agency--the\r\nbattle of the land and the sea. When you gaze at some line of cliffs\r\nthat is being eaten away by the waves, or reflect on the material\r\ncarried out to sea by the flooded river, you are--paradoxical as it may\r\nseem--beholding a material process that has had a profound influence on\r\nthe development of life. The Archaean continent that we described was\r\nbeing reduced constantly by the wash of rain, the scouring of rivers,\r\nand the fretting of the waves on the coast. It is generally thought that\r\nthese wearing agencies were more violent in early times, but that is\r\ndisputed, and we will not build on it. In any case, in the course of\r\ntime millions of tons of matter were scraped off the Archaean continent\r\nand laid on the floor of the sea by its rivers. This meant a very\r\nserious alteration of pressure or weight on the surface of the globe,\r\nand was bound to entail a reaction or restoration of the balance.\r\n\r\nThe rise of the land and formation of mountains used to be ascribed\r\nmainly to the cooling and shrinking of the globe of the earth. The skin\r\n(crust), it was thought, would become too large for the globe as it\r\nshrank, and would wrinkle outwards, or pucker up into mountain-chains.\r\nThe position of our greater mountain-chains sprawling across half the\r\nearth (the Pyrenees to the Himalaya, and the Rocky Mountains to the\r\nAndes), seems to confirm this, but the question of the interior of the\r\nearth is obscure and disputed, and geologists generally conceive the\r\nrise of land and formation of mountains in a different way. They are due\r\nprobably to the alteration of pressure on the crust in combination with\r\nthe instability of the interior. The floors of the seas would sink still\r\nlower under their colossal burdens, and this would cause some draining\r\nof the land-surface. At the same time the heavy pressure below the seas\r\nand the lessening of pressure over the land would provoke a reaction.\r\nEnormous masses of rock would be forced toward and underneath the\r\nland-surface, bending, crumpling, and upheaving it as if its crust were\r\nbut a leather coat. As a result, masses of land would slowly rise above\r\nthe plain, to be shaped into hills and valleys by the hand of later\r\ntime, and fresh surfaces would be dragged out of the deep, enlarging the\r\nfringes of the primitive continents, to be warped and crumpled in their\r\nturn at the next era of pressure.\r\n\r\nIn point of geological fact, the story of the earth has been one\r\nprolonged series of changes in the level of land and water, and in their\r\nrespective limits. These changes have usually been very gradual, but\r\nthey have always entailed changes (in climate, etc. ) of the greatest\r\nsignificance in the evolution of life. What was the swampy soil of\r\nEngland in the Carboniferous period is now sometimes thousands of feet\r\nbeneath us; and what was the floor of a deep ocean over much of Europe\r\nand Asia at another time is now to be found on the slopes of lofty Alps,\r\nor 20,000 feet above the sea-level in Thibet. Our story of terrestrial\r\nlife will be, to a great extent, the story of how animals and plants\r\nchanged their structure in the long series of changes which this endless\r\nbattle of land and sea brought over the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nAs we have no recognisable remains of the animals and plants of the\r\nearliest age, we will not linger over the Archaean rocks. Starting from\r\ndeep and obscure masses of volcanic matter, the geologist, as he\r\ntravels up the series of Archaean rocks, can trace only a dim and\r\nmost unsatisfactory picture of those remote times. Between outpours of\r\nvolcanic floods he finds, after a time, traces that an ocean and rivers\r\nare wearing away the land. He finds seams of carbon among the rocks of\r\nthe second division of the Archaean (the Keewatin), and deduces from\r\nthis that a dense sea-weed population already covered the floor of\r\nthe ocean. In the next division (the Huronian) he finds the traces of\r\nextensive ice-action strangely lying between masses of volcanic rock,\r\nand sees that thousands of square miles of eastern North America were\r\nthen covered with an ice-sheet. Then fresh floods of molten matter are\r\npoured out from the depths below; then the sea floods the land for a\r\ntime; and at last it makes its final emergence as the first definitive\r\npart of the North American continent, to enlarge, by successive fringes,\r\nto the continent of to-day. [*]\r\n\r\n     * I am quoting Professor Coleman's summary of Archaean\r\n     research in North America (Address to the Geological Section\r\n     of the British Association, 1909). Europe, as a continent,\r\n     has had more \"ups and downs\" than America in the course of\r\n     geological time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis meagre picture of the battle of land and sea, with interludes of\r\ngreat volcanic activity and even of an ice age, represents nearly all\r\nwe know of the first half of the world's story from geology. It is\r\nespecially disappointing in regard to the living population. The very\r\nfew fossils we find in the upper Archaean rocks are so similar to those\r\nwe shall discuss in the next chapter that we may disregard them, and the\r\nseams of carbon-shales, iron-ore, and limestone, suggest only, at the\r\nmost, that life was already abundant. We must turn elsewhere for some\r\ninformation on the origin and early development of life.\r\n\r\nThe question of the origin of life I will dismiss with a brief account\r\nof the various speculations of recent students of science. Broadly\r\nspeaking, their views fall into three classes. Some think that the germs\r\nof life may have come to the earth from some other body in the universe;\r\nsome think that life was evolved out of non-living matter in the early\r\nages of the earth, under exceptional conditions which we do not at\r\npresent know, or can only dimly conjecture; and some think that life\r\nis being evolved from non-life in nature to-day, and always has been so\r\nevolving. The majority of scientific men merely assume that the earliest\r\nliving things were no exception to the general process of evolution, but\r\nthink that we have too little positive knowledge to speculate profitably\r\non the manner of their origin.\r\n\r\nThe first view, that the germs of life may have come to this planet on a\r\nmeteoric visitor from some other world, as a storm-driven bird may take\r\nits parasites to some distant island, is not without adherents to-day.\r\nIt was put forward long ago by Lord Kelvin and others; it has been\r\nrevived by the distinguished Swede, Professor Svante Arrhenius. The\r\nscientific objection to it is that the more intense (ultra-violet) rays\r\nof the sun would frill such germs as they pass through space. But a\r\nbroader objection, and one that may dispense us from dwelling on it, is\r\nthat we gain nothing by throwing our problems upon another planet. We\r\nhave no ground for supposing that the earth is less capable of evolving\r\nlife than other planets.\r\n\r\nThe second view is that, when the earth had passed through its white-hot\r\nstage, great masses of very complex chemicals, produced by the great\r\nheat, were found on its surface. There is one complex chemical substance\r\nin particular, called cyanogen, which is either an important constituent\r\nof living matter, or closely akin to it. Now we need intense heat to\r\nproduce this substance in the laboratory. May we not suppose that masses\r\nof it were produced during the incandescence of the earth, and that,\r\nwhen the waters descended, they passed through a series of changes which\r\nculminated in living plasm? Such is the \"cyanogen hypothesis\" of\r\nthe origin of life, advocated by able physiologists such as Pfluger,\r\nVerworn, and others. It has the merit of suggesting a reason why life\r\nmay not be evolving from non-life in nature to-day, although it may have\r\nso evolved in the Archaean period.\r\n\r\nOther students suggest other combinations of carbon-compounds and water\r\nin the early days. Some suggest that electric action was probably far\r\nmore intense in those ages; others think that quantities of radium\r\nmay have been left at the surface. But the most important of these\r\nspeculations on the origin of life in early times, and one that has the\r\nmerit of not assuming any essentially different conditions then than we\r\nfind now, is contained in a recent pronouncement of one of the greatest\r\norganic chemists in Europe, Professor Armstrong. He says that such\r\ngreat progress has been made in his science--the science of the chemical\r\nprocesses in living things--that \"their cryptic character seems to have\r\ndisappeared almost suddenly.\" On the strength of this new knowledge of\r\nliving matter, he ventures to say that \"a series of lucky accidents\"\r\ncould account for the first formation of living things out of non-living\r\nmatter in Archaean times. Indeed, he goes further. He names certain\r\ninorganic substances, and says that the blowing of these into pools by\r\nthe wind on the primitive planet would set afoot chemical combinations\r\nwhich would issue in the production of living matter. [*]\r\n\r\n     * See his address in Nature, vol. 76, p. 651. For other\r\n     speculations see Verworn's \"General Physiology,\" Butler\r\n     Burke's \"Origin of Life\" (1906), and Dr. Bastian's \"Origin\r\n     of Life\" (1911).\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the popular notion that scientific men have declared\r\nthat life cannot be evolved from non-life is very far astray. This\r\nblunder is usually due to a misunderstanding of the dogmatic statement\r\nwhich one often reads in scientific works that \"every living thing comes\r\nfrom a living thing.\" This principle has no reference to remote ages,\r\nwhen the conditions may have been different. It means that to-day,\r\nwithin our experience, the living thing is always born of a living\r\nparent. However, even this is questioned by some scientific men of\r\neminence, and we come to the third view.\r\n\r\nProfessor Nageli, a distinguished botanist, and Professor Haeckel,\r\nmaintain that our experience, as well as the range of our microscopes,\r\nis too limited to justify the current axiom. They believe that life may\r\nbe evolving constantly from inorganic matter. Professor J. A. Thomson\r\nalso warns us that our experience is very limited, and, for all we know,\r\nprotoplasm may be forming naturally in our own time. Mr. Butler Burke\r\nhas, under the action of radium, caused the birth of certain minute\r\nspecks which strangely imitate the behaviour of bacteria. Dr. Bastian\r\nhas maintained for years that he has produced living things from\r\nnon-living matter. In his latest experiments, described in the book\r\nquoted, purely inorganic matter is used, and it is previously subjected,\r\nin hermetically sealed tubes, to a heat greater than what has been found\r\nnecessary to kill any germs whatever.\r\n\r\nEvidently the problem of the origin of life is not hopeless, but our\r\nknowledge of the nature of living matter is still so imperfect that we\r\nmay leave detailed speculation on its origin to a future generation.\r\nOrganic chemistry is making such strides that the day may not be far\r\ndistant when living matter will be made by the chemist, and the secret\r\nof its origin revealed. For the present we must be content to choose the\r\nmore plausible of the best-informed speculations on the subject.\r\n\r\nBut while the origin of life is obscure, the early stages of its\r\nevolution come fairly within the range of our knowledge. To the inexpert\r\nit must seem strange that, whereas we must rely on pure speculation\r\nin attempting to trace the origin of life, we can speak with more\r\nconfidence of those early developments of plants and animals which are\r\nequally buried in the mists of the Archaean period. Have we not said\r\nthat nothing remains of the procession of organisms during half the\r\nearth's story but a shapeless seam of carbon or limestone?\r\n\r\nA simple illustration will serve to justify the procedure we are\r\nabout to adopt. Suppose that the whole of our literary and pictorial\r\nreferences to earlier stages in the development of the bicycle, the\r\nlocomotive, or the loom, were destroyed. We should still be able to\r\nretrace the phases of their evolution, because we should discover\r\nspecimens belonging to those early phases lingering in our museums, in\r\nbackward regions, and elsewhere. They might yet be useful in certain\r\nenvironments into which the higher machines have not penetrated. In the\r\nsame way, if all the remains of prehistoric man and early civilisation\r\nwere lost, we could still fairly retrace the steps of the human race, by\r\ngathering the lower tribes and races, and arranging them in the order\r\nof their advancement. They are so many surviving illustrations of the\r\nstages through which mankind as a whole has passed.\r\n\r\nJust in the same way we may marshal the countless species of animals and\r\nplants to-day in such order that they will, in a general way, exhibit\r\nto us the age-long procession of life. From the very start of living\r\nevolution certain forms dropped out of the onward march, and have\r\nremained, to our great instruction, what their ancestors were millions\r\nof years ago. People create a difficulty for themselves by imagining\r\nthat, if evolution is true, all animals must evolve. A glance at our own\r\nfellows will show the error of this. Of one family of human beings, as\r\na French writer has said, one only becomes a Napoleon; the others remain\r\nLucien, Jerome, or Joseph. Of one family of animals or trees, some\r\nadvance in one or other direction; some remain at the original level.\r\nThere is no \"law of progress.\" The accidents of the world and hereditary\r\nendowment impel some onward, and do not impel others. Hence at nearly\r\nevery great stage in the upward procession through the ages some\r\nregiment of plants or animals has dropped out, and it represents to-day\r\nthe stage of life at which it ceased to progress. In other words, when\r\nwe survey the line of the hundreds of thousands of species which we\r\nfind in nature to-day, we can trace, amid their countless variations and\r\nbranches, the line of organic evolution in the past; just as we could,\r\nfrom actual instances, study the evolution of a British house, from\r\nthe prehistoric remains in Devonshire to a mansion in Park Lane or a\r\nprovincial castle.\r\n\r\nAnother method of retracing the lost early chapters in the development\r\nof life is furnished by embryology. The value of this method is not\r\nrecognised by all embryologists, but there are now few authorities who\r\nquestion the substantial correctness of it, and we shall, as we proceed,\r\nsee some remarkable applications of it. In brief, it is generally\r\nadmitted that an animal or plant is apt to reproduce, during its\r\nembryonic development, some of the stages of its ancestry in past time.\r\nThis does not mean that a higher animal, whose ancestors were at one\r\ntime worms, at another time fishes, and at a later time reptiles, will\r\nsuccessively take the form of a little worm, a little fish, and a little\r\nreptile. The embryonic life itself has been subject to evolution, and\r\nthis reproduction of ancestral forms has been proportionately disturbed.\r\nStill, we shall find that animals will tend, in their embryonic\r\ndevelopment, to reproduce various structural features which can only be\r\nunderstood as reminiscences of ancestral organs. In the lower animals\r\nthe reproduction is much less disturbed than in the higher, but even in\r\nthe case of man this law is most strikingly verified. We shall find\r\nit useful sometimes at least in confirming our conclusions as to the\r\nancestry of a particular group.\r\n\r\nWe have, therefore, two important clues to the missing chapters in the\r\nstory of evolution. Just as the scheme of the evolution of worlds is\r\nwritten broadly across the face of the heavens to-day, so the scheme of\r\nthe evolution of life is written on the face of living nature; and it\r\nis written again, in blurred and broken characters, in the embryonic\r\ndevelopment of each individual. With these aids we set out to restore\r\nthe lost beginning of the epic of organic evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. THE INFANCY OF THE EARTH\r\n\r\nThe long Archaean period, into which half the story of the earth is so\r\nunsatisfactorily packed, came to a close with a considerable uplift of\r\nthe land. We have seen that the earth at times reaches critical stages\r\nowing to the transfer of millions of tons of matter from the land to the\r\ndepths of the ocean, and the need to readjust the pressure on the crust.\r\nApparently this stage is reached at the end of the Archaean, and a great\r\nrise of the land--probably protracted during hundreds of thousands of\r\nyears--takes place. The shore-bottoms round the primitive continent are\r\nraised above the water, their rocks crumpling like plates of lead\r\nunder the overpowering pressure. The sea retires with its inhabitants,\r\nmingling their various provinces, transforming their settled homes. A\r\nlarger continent spans the northern ocean of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn the shore-waters of this early continent are myriads of living\r\nthings, representing all the great families of the animal world below\r\nthe level of the fish and the insect. The mud and sand in which their\r\nframes are entombed, as they die, will one day be the \"Cambrian\" rocks\r\nof the geologist, and reveal to him their forms and suggest their\r\nhabits. No great volcanic age will reduce them to streaks of shapeless\r\ncarbon. The earth now buries its dead, and from their petrified remains\r\nwe conjure up a picture of the swarming life of the Cambrian ocean.\r\n\r\nA strange, sluggish population burrows in the mud, crawls over the sand,\r\nadheres to the rocks, and swims among the thickets of sea-weed. The\r\nstrangest and most formidable, though still too puny a thing to survive\r\nin a more strenuous age, is the familiar Trilobite of the geological\r\nmuseum; a flattish animal with broad, round head, like a shovel, its\r\nback covered with a three-lobed shell, and a number of fine legs or\r\nswimmers below. It burrows in the loose bottom, or lies in it with\r\nits large compound eyes peeping out in search of prey. It is the chief\r\nrepresentative of the hard-cased group (Crustacea) which will later\r\nreplace it with the lobster, the shrimp, the crab, and the water-flea.\r\nIts remains form from a third to a fourth of all the buried Cambrian\r\nskeletons. With it, swimming in the water, are smaller members of the\r\nsame family, which come nearer to our familiar small Crustacea.\r\n\r\nShell-fish are the next most conspicuous inhabitants. Molluscs are\r\nalready well represented, but the more numerous are the more elementary\r\nBrachiopods (\"lampshells\"), which come next to the Trilobites in number\r\nand variety. Worms (or Annelids) wind in and out of the mud, leaving\r\ntheir tracks and tubes for later ages. Strange ball or cup-shaped little\r\nanimals, with a hard frame, mounted on stony stalks and waving irregular\r\narms to draw in the food-bearing water, are the earliest representatives\r\nof the Echinoderms. Some of these Cystids will presently blossom into\r\nthe wonderful sea-lily population of the next age, some are already\r\nquitting their stalks, to become the free-moving star-fish, of which\r\na primitive specimen has been found in the later Cambrian. Large\r\njelly-fishes (of which casts are preserved) swim in the water;\r\ncoral-animals lay their rocky foundations, but do not as yet form reefs;\r\ncoarse sponges rise from the floor; and myriads of tiny Radiolaria and\r\nThalamophores, with shells of flint and lime, float at the surface or at\r\nvarious depths.\r\n\r\nThis slight sketch of the Cambrian population shows us that living\r\nthings had already reached a high level of development. Their story\r\nevidently goes back, for millions of years, deep into those mists of the\r\nArchaean age which we were unable to penetrate. We turn therefore to\r\nthe zoologist to learn what he can tell us of the origin and\r\nfamily-relations of these Cambrian animals, and will afterwards see how\r\nthey are climbing to higher levels under the eye of the geologist.\r\n\r\nAt the basis of the living world of to-day is a vast population of\r\nminute, generally microscopic, animals and plants, which are popularly\r\nknown as \"microbes.\" Each consists, in scientific language, of one cell.\r\nIt is now well known that the bodies of the larger animals and plants\r\nare made up of millions of these units of living matter, or cells--the\r\natoms of the organic world--and I need not enlarge on it. But even a\r\nsingle cell lends itself to infinite variety of shape, and we have to\r\npenetrate to the very lowest level of this luxuriant world of one-celled\r\norganisms to obtain some idea of the most primitive living things.\r\nProperly speaking, there were no \"first living things.\" It cannot be\r\ndoubted by any student of nature that the microbe developed so gradually\r\nthat it is as impossible to fix a precise term for the beginning of life\r\nas it is to say when the night ends and the day begins. In the course of\r\ntime little one-celled living units appeared in the waters of the earth,\r\nwhether in the shallow shore waters or on the surface of the deep is a\r\nmatter of conjecture.\r\n\r\nWe are justified in concluding that they were at least as rudimentary\r\nin structure and life as the lowest inhabitants of nature to-day. The\r\ndistinction of being the lowest known living organisms should, I think,\r\nbe awarded to certain one-celled vegetal organisms which are very common\r\nin nature. Minute simple specks of living matter, sometimes less than\r\nthe five-thousandth of an inch in diameter, these lowly Algae are so\r\nnumerous that it is they, in their millions, which cover moist surfaces\r\nwith the familiar greenish or bluish coat. They have no visible\r\norganisation, though, naturally, they must have some kind of structure\r\nbelow the range of the microscope. Their life consists in the absorption\r\nof food-particles, at any point of their surface, and in dividing into\r\ntwo living microbes, instead of dying, when their bulk increases. A very\r\nlowly branch of the Bacteria (Nitrobacteria) sometimes dispute their\r\nclaim to the lowest position in the hierarchy of living nature, but\r\nthere is reason to suspect that these Bacteria may have degenerated from\r\na higher level.\r\n\r\nHere we have a convenient starting-point for the story of life, and\r\nmay now trace the general lines of upward development. The first great\r\nprinciple to be recognised is the early division of these primitive\r\norganisms into two great classes, the moving and the stationary. The\r\nclue to this important divergence is found in diet. With exceptions\r\non both sides, we find that the non-moving microbes generally feed on\r\ninorganic matter, which they convert into plasm; the moving microbes\r\ngenerally feed on ready-made plasm--on the living non-movers, on each\r\nother, or on particles of dead organic matter. Now, inorganic food is\r\ngenerally diffused in the waters, so that the vegetal feeders have no\r\nincentive to develop mobility. On the other hand, the power to move\r\nin search of their food, which is not equally diffused, becomes a most\r\nimportant advantage to the feeders on other organisms. They therefore\r\ndevelop various means of locomotion. Some flow or roll slowly along\r\nlike tiny drops of oil on an inclined surface; others develop minute\r\noutgrowths of their substance, like fine hairs, which beat the water as\r\noars do. Some of them have one strong oar, like the gondolier (but in\r\nfront of the boat); others have two or more oars; while some have their\r\nlittle flanks bristling with fine lashes, like the flanks of a Roman\r\ngalley.\r\n\r\nIf we imagine this simple principle at work for ages among the primitive\r\nmicrobes, we understand the first great division of the living world,\r\ninto plants and animals. There must have been a long series of earlier\r\nstages below the plant and animal. In fact, some writers insist that the\r\nfirst organisms were animal in nature, feeding on the more elementary\r\nstages of living matter. At last one type develops chlorophyll (the\r\ngreen matter in leaves), and is able to build up plasm out of inorganic\r\nmatter; another type develops mobility, and becomes a parasite on the\r\nplant world. There is no rigid distinction of the two worlds. Many\r\nmicroscopic plants move about just as animals do, and many animals live\r\non fixed stalks; while many plants feed on organic matter. There is so\r\nlittle \"difference of nature\" between the plant and the animal that the\r\nexperts differ in classifying some of these minute creatures. In fact,\r\nwe shall often find plants and animals crossing the line of division. We\r\nshall find animals rooting themselves to the floor, like plants, though\r\nthey will generally develop arms or streamers for bringing the food to\r\nthem; and we shall find plants becoming insect-catchers. All this\r\nmerely shows that the difference is a natural tendency, which special\r\ncircumstances may overrule. It remains true that the great division\r\nof the organic world is due to a simple principle of development;\r\ndifference of diet leads to difference of mobility.\r\n\r\nBut this simple principle will have further consequences of a most\r\nimportant character. It will lead to the development of mind in one half\r\nof living nature and leave it undeveloped in the other. Mind, as we know\r\nit in the lower levels of life, is not confined to the animal at\r\nall. Many even of the higher plants are very delicately sensitive\r\nto stimulation, and at the lowest level many plants behave just like\r\nanimals. In other words, this sensitiveness to stimuli, which is\r\nthe first form of mind, is distributed according to mobility. To the\r\nmotionless organism it is no advantage; to the pursuing and pursued\r\norganism it is an immense advantage, and is one of the chief qualities\r\nfor natural selection to foster.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, however, we must glance at the operation of this and\r\nother natural principles in the evolution of the one-celled animals\r\nand plants, which we take to represent the primitive population of\r\nthe earth. As there are tens of thousands of different species even of\r\n\"microbes,\" it is clear that we must deal with them in a very summary\r\nway. The evolution of the plant I reserve for a later chapter, and I\r\nmust be content to suggest the development of one-celled animals on\r\nvery broad lines. When some of the primitive cells began to feed on each\r\nother, and develop mobility, it is probable that at least two distinct\r\ntypes were evolved, corresponding to the two lowest animal organisms in\r\nnature to-day. One of these is a very minute and very common (in vases\r\nof decaying flowers, for instance) speck of plasm, which moves about by\r\nlashing the water with a single oar (flagellum), or hair-like extension\r\nof its substance. This type, however, which is known as the Flagellate,\r\nmay be derived from the next, which we will take as the primitive and\r\nfundamental animal type. It is best seen in the common and familiar\r\nAmoeba, a minute sac of liquid or viscid plasm, often not more than a\r\nhundredth of an inch in diameter. As its \"skin\" is merely a finer kind\r\nof the viscous plasm, not an impenetrable membrane, it takes in food at\r\nany part of its surface, makes little \"stomachs,\" or temporary cavities,\r\nround the food at any part of its interior, ejects the useless matter at\r\nany point, and thrusts out any part of its body as temporary \"arms\" or\r\n\"feet.\"\r\n\r\nNow it is plain that in an age of increasing microbic cannibalism the\r\ntoughening of the skin would be one of the first advantages to secure\r\nsurvival, and this is, in point of fact, almost the second leading\r\nprinciple in early development. Naturally, as the skin becomes firmer,\r\nthe animal can no longer, like the Amoeba, take food at, or make limbs\r\nof, any part of it. There must be permanent pores in the membrane to\r\nreceive food or let out rays of the living substance to act as oars\r\nor arms. Thus we get an immense variety amongst these Protozoa, as the\r\none-celled animals are called. Some (the Flagellates) have one or two\r\nstout oars; some (the Ciliates) have numbers of fine hairs (or cilia).\r\nSome have a definite mouth-funnel, but no stomach, and cilia drawing\r\nthe water into it. Some (Vorticella, etc.), shrinking from the open\r\nbattlefield, return to the plant-principle, live on stalks, and have\r\nwreaths of cilia round the open mouth drawing the water to them. Some\r\n(the Heliozoa) remain almost motionless, shooting out sticky rays of\r\ntheir matter on every side to catch the food. Some form tubes to live\r\nin; some (Coleps) develop horny plates for armour; and others develop\r\nprojectiles to pierce their prey (stinging threads).\r\n\r\nThis miniature world is full of evolutionary interest, but it is too\r\nvast for detailed study here. We will take one group, which we know\r\nto have been already developed in the Cambrian, and let a study of its\r\ndevelopment stand for all. In every lecture or book on \"the beauties of\r\nthe microscope\" we find, and are generally greatly puzzled by, minute\r\nshells of remarkable grace and beauty that are formed by some of these\r\nvery elementary animals They are the Radiolaria (with flinty shells, as\r\na rule) and the Thalamophora (with chalk frames). Evolution furnishes a\r\nsimple key to their remarkable structure.\r\n\r\nAs we saw, one of the early requirements to be fostered by natural\r\nselection in the Archaean struggle for life was a \"thick skin,\" and\r\nthe thick skin had to be porous to let the animal shoot out its viscid\r\nsubstance in rays and earn its living. This stage above the Amoeba\r\nis beautifully illustrated in the sun-animalcules (Heliozoa). Now the\r\nlowest types of Radiolaria are of this character. They have no shell\r\nor framework at all. The next stage is for the little animal to develop\r\nfine irregular threads of flint in its skin, a much better security\r\nagainst the animal-eater. These animalcules, it must be recollected,\r\nare bits of almost pure plasm, and, as they live in crowds, dividing\r\nand subdividing, but never dying, make excellent mouthfuls for a small\r\nfeeder. Those with the more flint in their skins were the more apt to\r\nsurvive and \"breed.\" The threads of flint increase until they form a\r\nsort of thorn-thicket round a little social group, or a complete lattice\r\nround an individual body. Next, spikes or spines jut out from the\r\nlattice, partly for additional protection, partly to keep the little\r\nbody afloat at the surface of the sea. In this way we get a bewildering\r\nvariety and increasing complexity of forms, ascending in four divergent\r\nlines from the naked ancestral type to the extreme grace and intricacy\r\nof the Calocyclas monumentum or the Lychnaspis miranda. These, however,\r\nare rare specimens in the 4000 species of Radiolaria. I have hundreds of\r\nthem, on microscopic slides, which have no beauty and little regularity\r\nof form. We see a gradual evolution, on utilitarian principles, as\r\nwe run over the thousands of forms; and, when we recollect the\r\ninconceivable numbers in which these little animals have lived and\r\nstruggled for life--passively--during tens of millions of years, we are\r\nnot surprised at the elaborate protective frames of the higher types.\r\n\r\nThe Thalamophores, the sister-group of one-celled animals which largely\r\ncompose our chalk and much of our limestone, are developed on the same\r\nprinciple. The earlier forms seem to have lived in a part of the ocean\r\nwhere silica was scarce, and they absorbed and built their protective\r\nframes of lime. In the simpler types the frame is not unlike a\r\nwide-necked bottle, turned upside-down. In later forms it takes the\r\nshape of a spirally coiled series of chambers, sometimes amounting to\r\nseveral thousand. These wonderful little houses are not difficult to\r\nunderstand. The original tiny animal covers itself with a coat of lime.\r\nIt feeds, grows, and bulges out of its chamber. The new part of its\r\nflesh must have a fresh coat, and the process goes on until scores, or\r\nhundreds, or even thousands, of these tiny chambers make up the spiral\r\nshell of the morsel of living matter.\r\n\r\nWith this brief indication of the mechanical principles which have\r\ndirected the evolution of two of the most remarkable groups of the\r\none-celled animals we must be content, or the dimensions of this volume\r\nwill not enable us even to reach the higher and more interesting types.\r\nWe must advance at once to the larger animals, whose bodies are composed\r\nof myriads of cells.\r\n\r\nThe social tendency which pervades the animal world, and the evident use\r\nof that tendency, prepare us to understand that the primitive\r\nmicrobes would naturally come in time to live in clusters. Union means\r\neffectiveness in many ways, even when it does not mean strength. We\r\nhave still many loose associations of one-celled animals in nature,\r\nillustrating the approach to a community life. Numbers of the Protozoa\r\nare social; they live either in a common jelly-like matrix, or on a\r\ncommon stalk. In fact, we have a singularly instructive illustration of\r\nthe process in the evolution of the sponges.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the horny texture to which we commonly give\r\nthe name of sponge is the former tenement and shelter of a colony of\r\none-celled animals, which are the real Sponges. In other groups the\r\nstructure is of lime; in others, again, of flinty material. Now, the\r\nSponges, as we have them to-day, are so varied, and start from so low\r\na level, that no other group of animals \"illustrates so strikingly the\r\ntheory of evolution,\" as Professor Minchin says. We begin with colonies\r\nin which the individuals are (as in Proterospongia) irregularly\r\ndistributed in their jelly-like common bed, each animal lashing the\r\nwater, as stalked Flagellates do, and bringing the food to it. Such a\r\ncolony would be admirable food for an early carnivore, and we soon find\r\nthe protective principle making it less pleasant for the devourer. The\r\nfirst stage may be--at least there are such Sponges even now--that the\r\ncommon bed is strewn or sown with the cast shells of Radiolaria. However\r\nthat may be, the Sponges soon begin to absorb the silica or lime of\r\nthe sea-water, and deposit it in needles or fragments in their bed. The\r\ndeposit goes on until at last an elaborate framework of thorny, or limy,\r\nor flinty material is constructed by the one-celled citizens. In the\r\nhigher types a system of pores or canals lets the food-bearing water\r\npass through, as the animals draw it in with their lashes; in the\r\nhighest types the animals come still closer together, lining the walls\r\nof little chambers in the interior.\r\n\r\nHere we have a very clear evolutionary transition from the solitary\r\nmicrobe to a higher level, but, unfortunately, it does not take us far.\r\nThe Sponges are a side-issue, or cul de sac, from the Protozoic world,\r\nand do not lead on to the higher. Each one-celled unit remains an\r\nanimal; it is a colony of unicellulars, not a many-celled body. We\r\nmay admire it as an instructive approach toward the formation of\r\na many-celled body, but we must look elsewhere for the true upward\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nThe next stage is best illustrated in certain spherical colonies of\r\ncells like the tiny green Volvox (now generally regarded as vegetal)\r\nof our ponds, or Magosphoera. Here the constituent cells merge\r\ntheir individuality in the common action. We have the first definite\r\nmany-celled body. It is the type to which a moving close colony of\r\none-celled microbes would soon come. The round surface is well adapted\r\nfor rolling or spinning along in the water, and, as each little cell\r\nearns its own living, it must be at the surface, in contact with the\r\nwater. Thus a hollow, or fluid-filled, little sphere, like the Volvox,\r\nis the natural connecting-link between the microbe and the many-celled\r\nbody, and may be taken to represent the first important stage in its\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThe next important stage is also very clearly exhibited in nature, and\r\nis more or less clearly reproduced in the embryonic development of all\r\nanimals. We may imagine that the age of microbes was succeeded by an age\r\nof these many-celled larger bodies, and the struggle for life entered\r\nupon a new phase. The great principle we have already recognised came\r\ninto play once more. Large numbers of the many-celled bodies shrank from\r\nthe field of battle, and adopted the method of the plant. They rooted\r\nthemselves to the floor of the ocean, and developed long arms or lashes\r\nfor creating a whirlpool movement in the water, and thus bringing the\r\nfood into their open mouths. Forfeiting mobility, they have, like the\r\nplant, forfeited the greater possibilities of progress, and they remain\r\nflowering to-day on the floors of our waters, recalling the next phase\r\nin the evolution of early life. Such are the hydra, the polyp, the\r\ncoral, and the sea-anemone. It is not singular that earlier observers\r\ncould not detect that they were animals, and they were long known in\r\nscience as \"animal-plants\" (Zoophytes).\r\n\r\nWhen we look to the common structure of these animals, to find the\r\nancestral type, we must ignore the nerve and muscle-cells which they\r\nhave developed in some degree. Fundamentally, their body consists of a\r\npouch, with an open mouth, the sides of the pouch consisting of a double\r\nlayer of cells. In this we have a clue to the next stage of animal\r\ndevelopment. Take a soft india-rubber ball to represent the first\r\nmany-celled animal. Press in one half of the ball close upon the other,\r\nnarrow the mouth, and you have something like the body-structure of the\r\ncoral and hydra. As this is the course of embryonic development, and as\r\nit is so well retained in the lowest groups of the many-celled animals,\r\nwe take it to be the next stage. The reason for it will become clear on\r\nreflection. Division of labour naturally takes place in a colony, and in\r\nthat way certain cells in the primitive body were confined to the work\r\nof digestion. It would be an obvious advantage for these to retire into\r\nthe interior, leaving the whole external surface free for the adjustment\r\nof the animal's relations to the outer world.\r\n\r\nAgain we must refrain from following in detail the development of\r\nthis new world of life which branches off in the Archaean ocean. The\r\nevolution of the Corals alone would be a lengthy and interesting\r\nstory. But a word must be said about the jelly-fish, partly because the\r\ninexpert will be puzzled at the inclusion of so active an animal, and\r\npartly because its story admirably illustrates the principle we are\r\nstudying. The Medusa really descends from one of the plant-like animals\r\nof the early Archaean period, but it has abandoned the ancestral stalk,\r\nturned upside down, and developed muscular swimming organs. Its past is\r\nbetrayed in its embryonic development. As a rule the germ develops into\r\na stalked polyp, out of which the free-swimming Medusa is formed. This\r\nreturn to active and free life must have occurred early, as we find\r\ncasts of large Medusae in the Cambrian beds. In complete harmony with\r\nthe principle we laid down, the jelly-fish has gained in nerve and\r\nsensitiveness in proportion to its return to an active career.\r\n\r\nBut this principle is best illustrated in the other branch of the early\r\nmany-celled animals, which continued to move about in search of food.\r\nHere, as will be expected, we have the main stem of the animal world,\r\nand, although the successive stages of development are obscure, certain\r\nbroad lines that it followed are clear and interesting.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that in a swarming population of such animals the most\r\nvaluable qualities will be speed and perception. The sluggish Coral\r\nneeds only sensitiveness enough, and mobility enough, to shrink behind\r\nits protecting scales at the approach of danger. In the open water the\r\nmost speedy and most sensitive will be apt to escape destruction,\r\nand have the larger share in breeding the next generation. Imagine a\r\nselection on this principle going on for millions of years, and the\r\ngeneral result can be conjectured. A very interesting analogy is found\r\nin the evolution of the boat. From the clumsy hollowed tree of Neolithic\r\nman natural selection, or the need of increasing speed, has developed\r\nthe elongated, evenly balanced modern boat, with its distinct stem and\r\nstern. So in the Archaean ocean the struggle to overtake food, or escape\r\nfeeders, evolved an elongated two-sided body, with head and tail, and\r\nwith the oars (cilia) of the one-celled ancestor spread thickly along\r\nits flanks. In other words, a body akin to that of the lower water-worms\r\nwould be the natural result; and this is, in point of fact, the next\r\nstage we find in the hierarchy of living nature.\r\n\r\nProbably myriads of different types of this worm-like organisation were\r\ndeveloped, but such animals leave no trace in the rocks, and we can\r\nonly follow the development by broad analogies. The lowest flat-worms\r\nof to-day may represent some of these early types, and as we ascend\r\nthe scale of what is loosely called \"worm\" organisation, we get some\r\ninstructive suggestions of the way in which the various organs develop.\r\nDivision of labour continues among the colony of cells which make up\r\nthe body, and we get distinct nerve-cells, muscle-cells, and digestive\r\ncells. The nerve-cells are most useful at the head of an organism which\r\nmoves through the water, just as the look-out peers from the head of the\r\nship, and there they develop most thickly. By a fresh division of labour\r\nsome of these cells become especially sensitive to light, some to the\r\nchemical qualities of matter, some to movements of the water; we have\r\nthe beginning of the eyes, the nose, and the ears, as simple little\r\ndepressions in the skin of the head, lined with these sensitive cells. A\r\nmuscular gullet arises to protect the digestive tube; a simple drainage\r\nchannel for waste matter forms under the skin; other channels permit\r\nthe passage of the fluid food, become (in the higher worms) muscular\r\nblood-vessels, and begin to contract--somewhat erratically at first--and\r\ndrive the blood through the system.\r\n\r\nHere, perhaps, are millions of years of development compressed into\r\na paragraph. But the purpose of this work is chiefly to describe the\r\nmaterial record of the advance of life in the earth's strata, and show\r\nhow it is related to great geological changes. We must therefore abstain\r\nfrom endeavouring to trace the genealogy of the innumerable types of\r\nanimals which were, until recently, collected in zoology under the\r\nheading \"Worms.\" It is more pertinent to inquire how the higher classes\r\nof animals, which we found in the Cambrian seas, can have arisen from\r\nthis primitive worm-like population.\r\n\r\nThe struggle for life in the Archaean ocean would become keener and more\r\nexacting with the appearance of each new and more effective type. That\r\nis a familiar principle in our industrial world to-day, and we shall\r\nfind it illustrated throughout our story. We therefore find the various\r\nprocesses of evolution, which we have already seen, now actively at\r\nwork among the swarming Archaean population, and producing several\r\nvery distinct types. In some of these struggling organisms speed is\r\ndeveloped, together with offensive and defensive weapons, and a line\r\nslowly ascends toward the fish, which we will consider later. In others\r\ndefensive armour is chiefly developed, and we get the lines of the\r\nheavy sluggish shell-fish, the Molluscs and Brachiopods, and, by a\r\nlater compromise between speed and armour, the more active tough-coated\r\nArthropods. In others the plant-principle reappears; the worm-like\r\ncreature retires from the free-moving life, attaches itself to a\r\nfixed base, and becomes the Bryozoan or the Echinoderm. To trace the\r\ndevelopment of these types in any detail is impossible. The early\r\nremains are not preserved. But some clues are found in nature or in\r\nembryonic development, and, when the types do begin to be preserved in\r\nthe rocks, we find the process of evolution plainly at work in them. We\r\nwill therefore say a few words about the general evolution of each type,\r\nand then return to the geological record in the Cambrian rocks.\r\n\r\nThe starfish, the most familiar representative of the Echinoderms,\r\nseems very far removed from the kind of worm-like ancestor we have been\r\nimagining, but, fortunately, the very interesting story of the starfish\r\nis easily learned from the geological chronicle. Reflect on the\r\nflower-like expansion of its arms, and then imagine it mounted on a\r\nstalk, mouth side upward, with those arms--more tapering than they\r\nnow are--waving round the mouth. That, apparently, was the past of the\r\nstarfish and its cousins. We shall see that the earliest Echinoderms we\r\nknow are cup-shaped structures on stalks, with a stiff, limy frame and\r\n(as in all sessile animals) a number of waving arms round the mouth.\r\nIn the next geological age the stalk will become a long and flexible\r\narrangement of muscles and plates of chalk, the cup will be more\r\nperfectly compacted of chalky plates, and the five arms will taper and\r\nbranch until they have an almost feathery appearance; and the animal\r\nwill be considered a \"sea-lily\" by the early geologist.\r\n\r\nThe evidence suggests that both the free-moving and the stalked\r\nEchinoderms descend from a common stalked Archaean ancestor. Some\r\nprimitive animal abandoned the worm-like habit, and attached itself,\r\nlike a polyp, to the floor. Like all such sessile animals, it developed\r\na wreath of arms round the open mouth. The \"sea-cucumber\" (Holothurian)\r\nseems to be a type that left the stalk, retaining the little wreath of\r\narms, before the body was heavily protected and deformed. In the others\r\na strong limy skeleton was developed, and the nerves and other organs\r\nwere modified in adaptation to the bud-like or flower-like structure.\r\nAnother branch of the family then abandoned the stalk, and, spreading\r\nits arms flat, and gradually developing in them numbers of little \"feet\"\r\n(water-tubes), became the starfish. In the living Comatula we find a\r\nstar passing through the stalked stage in its early development, when it\r\nlooks like a tiny sea-lily. The sea-urchin has evolved from the star by\r\nfolding the arms into a ball. [*]\r\n\r\n     * See the section on Echinoderms, by Professor MacBride, in\r\n     the \"Cambridge Natural History,\" I.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bryozoa (sea-mats, etc.) are another and lower branch of the\r\nprimitive active organisms which have adopted a sessile life. In the\r\nshell-fish, on the other hand, the principle of armour-plating has its\r\ngreatest development. It is assuredly a long and obscure way that\r\nleads from the ancestral type of animal we have been describing to\r\nthe headless and shapeless mussel or oyster. Such a degeneration is,\r\nhowever, precisely what we should expect to find in the circumstances.\r\nIndeed, the larva, of many of the headless Molluscs have a mouth and\r\neyes, and there is a very common type of larva--the trochosphere--in the\r\nMollusc world which approaches the earlier form of some of the\r\nhigher worms. The Molluscs, as we shall see, provide some admirable\r\nillustrations of the process of evolution. In some of the later\r\nfossilised specimens (Planorbis, Paludina, etc.) we can trace the animal\r\nas it gradually passes from one species to another. The freshening of\r\nthe Caspian Sea, which was an outlying part of the Mediterranean quite\r\nlate in the geological record, seems to have evolved several new genera\r\nof Molluscs.\r\n\r\nAlthough, therefore, the remains are not preserved of those primitive\r\nMolluscs in which we might see the protecting shell gradually\r\nthickening, and deforming the worm-like body, we are not without\r\nindications of the process. Two unequal branches of the early wormlike\r\norganisms shrank into strong protective shells. The lower branch became\r\nthe Brachiopods; the more advanced branch the Molluscs. In the Mollusc\r\nworld, in turn, there are several early types developed. In the\r\nPelecypods (or Lamellibranchs--the mussel, oyster, etc.) the animal\r\nretires wholly within its fortress, and degenerates. The Gastropods\r\n(snails, etc.) compromise, and retain a certain amount of freedom, so\r\nthat they degenerate less. The highest group, the Cephalopods, \"keep\r\ntheir heads,\" in the literal sense, and we shall find them advancing\r\nfrom form to form until, in the octopus of a later age, they discard the\r\nancestral shell, and become the aristocrats of the Mollusc kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe last and most important line that led upward from the chaos of\r\nArchaean worms is that of the Arthropods. Its early characteristic was\r\nthe acquisition of a chitinous coat over the body. Embryonic indications\r\nshow that this was at first a continuous shield, but a type arose in\r\nwhich the coat broke into sections covering each segment of the body,\r\ngiving greater freedom of movement. The shield, in fact, became a fine\r\ncoat of mail. The Trilobite is an early and imperfect experiment of the\r\nclass, and the larva of the modern king-crab bears witness that it has\r\nnot perished without leaving descendants. How later Crustacea increase\r\nthe toughness of the coat by deposits of lime, and lead on to the\r\ncrab and lobster, and how one early branch invades the land, develops\r\nair-breathing apparatus, and culminates in the spiders and insects, will\r\nbe considered later. We shall see that there is most remarkable evidence\r\nconnecting the highest of the Arthropods, the insect, with a remote\r\nAnnelid ancestor.\r\n\r\nWe are thus not entirely without clues to the origin of the more\r\nadvanced animals we find when the fuller geological record begins.\r\nFurther embryological study, and possibly the discovery of surviving\r\nprimitive forms, of which Central Africa may yet yield a number, may\r\nenlarge our knowledge, but it is likely to remain very imperfect.\r\nThe fossil records of the long ages during which the Mollusc, the\r\nCrustacean, and the Echinoderm slowly assumed their characteristic forms\r\nare hopelessly lost. But we are now prepared to return to the record\r\nwhich survives, and we shall find the remaining story of the earth a\r\nvery ample and interesting chronicle of evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. THE PASSAGE TO THE LAND\r\n\r\nSlender as our knowledge is of the earlier evolution of the Invertebrate\r\nanimals, we return to our Cambrian population with greater interest.\r\nThe uncouth Trilobite and its livelier cousins, the sluggish, skulking\r\nBrachiopod and Mollusc, the squirming Annelids, and the plant-like\r\nCystids, Corals, and Sponges are the outcome of millions of years of\r\nstruggle. Just as men, when their culture and their warfare advanced,\r\nclothed themselves with armour, and the most completely mailed\r\nsurvived the battle, so, generation after generation, the thicker and\r\nharder-skinned animals survived in the Archaean battlefield, and the\r\nCambrian age opened upon the various fashions of armour that we there\r\ndescribed. But, although half the story of life is over, organisation\r\nis still imperfect and sluggish. We have now to see how it advances to\r\nhigher levels, and how the drama is transferred from the ocean to a new\r\nand more stimulating environment.\r\n\r\nThe Cambrian age begins with a vigorous move on the part of the land.\r\nThe seas roll back from the shores of the \"lost Atlantis,\" and vast\r\nregions are laid bare to the sun and the rains. In the bays and hollows\r\nof the distant shores the animal survivors of the great upheaval adapt\r\nthemselves to their fresh homes and continue the struggle. But the\r\nrivers and the waves are at work once more upon the land, and, as the\r\nCambrian age proceeds, the fringes of the continents are sheared, and\r\nthe shore-life steadily advances upon the low-lying land. By the end of\r\nthe Cambrian age a very large proportion of the land is covered with\r\na shallow sea, in which the debris of its surface is deposited. The\r\nlevelling continues through the next (Ordovician) period. Before its\r\nclose nearly the whole of the United States and the greater part of\r\nCanada are under water, and the new land that had appeared on the site\r\nof Europe is also for the most part submerged. The present British Isles\r\nare almost reduced to a strip of north-eastern Ireland, the northern\r\nextremity of Scotland, and large islands in the south-west and centre of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that these victories of the sea are just as\r\nstimulating, in a different way, to animals as the victories of the\r\nland. American geologists are tracing, in a very instructive way, the\r\neffect on that early population of the encroachment of the sea. In each\r\narm of the sea is a distinctive fauna. Life is still very parochial; the\r\ngreat cosmopolitans, the fishes, have not yet arrived. As the land is\r\nrevelled, the arms of the sea approach each other, and at last mingle\r\ntheir waters and their populations, with stimulating effect. Provincial\r\ncharacters are modified, and cosmopolitan characters increase in the\r\ngreat central sea of America. The vast shallow waters provide a greatly\r\nenlarged theatre for the life of the time, and it flourishes enormously.\r\nThen, at the end of the Ordovician, the land begins to rise once more.\r\nWhether it was due to a fresh shrinking of the crust, or to the simple\r\nprocess we have described, or both, we need not attempt to determine;\r\nbut both in Europe and America there is a great emergence of land.\r\nThe shore-tracts and the shallow water are narrowed, the struggle is\r\nintensified in them, and we pass into the Silurian age with a greatly\r\nreduced number but more advanced variety of animals. In the Silurian\r\nage the sea advances once more, and the shore-waters expand. There is\r\nanother great \"expansive evolution\" of life. But the Silurian age closes\r\nwith a fresh and very extensive emergence of the land, and this time\r\nit will have the most important consequences. For two new things have\r\nmeantime appeared on the earth. The fish has evolved in the waters, and\r\nthe plant, at least, has found a footing on the land.\r\n\r\nThese geological changes which we have summarised and which have been\r\ntoo little noticed until recently in evolutionary studies, occupied\r\n7,000,000 years, on the lowest estimate, and probably twice that period.\r\nThe impatient critic of evolutionary hypotheses is apt to forget the\r\nlength of these early periods. We shall see that in the last two or\r\nthree million years of the earth's story most extraordinary progress\r\nhas been made in plant and animal development, and can be very fairly\r\ntraced. How much advance should we allow for these seven or fourteen\r\nmillion years of swarming life and changing environments?\r\n\r\nWe cannot nearly cover the whole ground of paleontology for the period,\r\nand must be content to notice some of the more interesting advances, and\r\nthen deal more fully with the evolution of the fish, the forerunner of\r\nthe great land animals.\r\n\r\nThe Trilobite was the most arresting figure in the Cambrian sea, and its\r\nfortunes deserve a paragraph. It reaches its climax in the Ordovician\r\nsea, and then begins to decline, as more powerful animals come upon the\r\nscene. At first (apparently) an eyeless organism, it gradually develops\r\ncompound eyes, and in some species the experts have calculated that\r\nthere were 15,000 facets to each eye. As time goes on, also, the eye\r\nstands out from the head on a kind of stalk, giving a wider range of\r\nvision. Some of the more sluggish species seem to have been able to\r\nroll themselves up, like hedgehogs, in their shells, when an enemy\r\napproached. But another branch of the same group (Crustacea) has\r\nmeantime advanced, and it gradually supersedes the dwindling Trilobites.\r\nToward the close of the Silurian great scorpion-like Crustaceans\r\n(Pterygotus, Eurypterus, etc.) make their appearance. Their development\r\nis obscure, but it must be remembered that the rocks only give the\r\nrecord of shore-life, and only a part of that is as yet opened by\r\ngeology. Some experts think that they were developed in inland waters.\r\nReaching sometimes a length of five or six feet, with two large compound\r\neyes and some smaller eye-spots (ocelli), they must have been the giants\r\nof the Silurian ocean until the great sharks and other fishes appeared.\r\n\r\nThe quaint stalked Echinoderm which also we noticed in the Cambrian\r\nshallows has now evolved into a more handsome creature, the sea-lily.\r\nThe cup-shaped body is now composed of a large number of limy plates,\r\nclothed with flesh; the arms are long, tapering, symmetrical, and richly\r\nfringed; the stalk advances higher and higher, until the flower-like\r\nanimal sometimes waves its feathery arms from the top of a flexible\r\npedestal composed of millions of tiny chalk disks. Small forests of\r\nthese sea-lilies adorn the floor of the Silurian ocean, and their broken\r\nand dead frames form whole beds of limestone. The primitive Cystids\r\ndwindle and die out in the presence of such powerful competitors. Of\r\n250 species only a dozen linger in the Silurian strata, though a new and\r\nmore advanced type--the Blastoid--holds the field for a time. It is the\r\nage of the Crinoids or sea-lilies. The starfish, which has abandoned the\r\nstalk, does not seem to prosper as yet, and the brittle-star appears.\r\nTheir age will come later. No sea-urchins or sea-cucumbers (which would\r\nhardly be preserved) are found as yet. It is precisely the order of\r\nappearance which our theory of their evolution demands.\r\n\r\nThe Brachiopods have passed into entirely new and more advanced species\r\nin the many advances and retreats of the shores, but the Molluscs show\r\nmore interesting progress. The commanding group from the start is that\r\nof the Molluscs which have \"kept their head,\" the Cephalopods, and\r\ntheir large shells show a most instructive evolution. The first great\r\nrepresentative of the tribe is a straight-shelled Cephalopod, which\r\nbecomes \"the tyrant and scavenger of the Silurian ocean\" (Chamberlin).\r\nIts tapering, conical shell sometimes runs to a length of fifteen\r\nfeet, and a diameter of one foot. It would of itself be an important\r\nevolutionary factor in the primitive seas, and might explain more than\r\none advance in protective armour or retreat into heavy shells. As the\r\nperiod advances the shell begins to curve, and at last it forms a\r\nclose spiral coil. This would be so great an advantage that we are not\r\nsurprised to find the coiled type (Goniatites) gain upon and gradually\r\nreplace the straight-shelled types (Orthoceratites). The Silurian\r\nocean swarms with these great shelled Cephalopods, of which the little\r\nNautilus is now the only survivor.\r\n\r\nWe will not enlarge on the Sponges and Corals, which are slowly\r\nadvancing toward the higher modern types. Two new and very powerful\r\norganisms have appeared, and merit the closest attention. One is the\r\nfish, the remote ancestor of the birds and mammals that will one day\r\nrule the earth. The other may be the ancestor of the fish itself, or it\r\nmay be one of the many abortive outcomes and unsuccessful experiments of\r\nthe stirring life of the time. And while these new types are themselves\r\na result of the great and stimulating changes which we have reviewed\r\nand the incessant struggle for food and safety, they in turn enormously\r\nquicken the pace of development. The Dreadnought appears in the\r\nprimitive seas; the effect on the fleets of the world of the evolution\r\nof our latest type of battleship gives us a faint idea of the effect, on\r\nall the moving population, of the coming of these monsters of the deep.\r\nThe age had not lacked incentives to progress; it now obtains a more\r\nterrible and far-reaching stimulus.\r\n\r\nTo understand the situation let us see how the battle of land and sea\r\nhad proceeded. The Devonian Period had opened with a fresh emergence of\r\nthe land, especially in Europe, and great inland seas or lakes were left\r\nin the hollows. The tincture of iron which gives a red colour to our\r\ncharacteristic Devonian rocks, the Old Red Sandstone, shows us that\r\nthe sand was deposited in inland waters. The fish had already been\r\ndeveloped, and the Devonian rocks show it swarming, in great numbers and\r\nvariety, in the enclosed seas and round the fringe of the continents.\r\n\r\nThe first generation was a group of strange creatures, half fish and\r\nhalf Crustacean, which are known as the Ostracoderms. They had large\r\narmour-plated heads, which recall the Trilobite, and suggest that they\r\ntoo burrowed in the mud of the sea or (as many think) of the inland\r\nlakes, making havoc among the shell-fish, worms, and small Crustacea.\r\nThe hind-part of their bodies was remarkably fish-like in structure. But\r\nthey had no backbone--though we cannot say whether they may not have\r\nhad a rod of cartilage along the back--and no articulated jaws like the\r\nfish. Some regard them as a connecting link between the Crustacea\r\nand the fishes, but the general feeling is that they were an abortive\r\ndevelopment in the direction of the fish. The sharks and other large\r\nfishes, which have appeared in the Silurian, easily displace these\r\nclumsy and poor-mouthed competitors One almost thinks of the aeroplane\r\nsuperseding the navigable balloon.\r\n\r\nOf the fishes the Arthrodirans dominated the inland seas (apparently),\r\nwhile the sharks commanded the ocean. One of the Arthrodirans, the\r\nDinichthys (\"terrible fish\"), is the most formidable fish known to\r\nscience. It measured twenty feet from snout to tail. Its monstrous head,\r\nthree feet in width, was heavily armoured, and, instead of teeth, its\r\ngreat jaws, two feet in length, were sharpened, and closed over the\r\nvictim like a gigantic pair of clippers. The strongly plated heads of\r\nthese fishes were commonly a foot or two feet in width. Life in the\r\nwaters became more exacting than ever. But the Arthrodirans were\r\nunwieldy and sluggish, and had to give way before more progressive\r\ntypes. The toothed shark gradually became the lord of the waters.\r\n\r\nThe early shark ate, amongst other things, quantities of Molluscs and\r\nBrachiopods. Possibly he began with Crustacea; in any case the practice\r\nof crunching shellfish led to a stronger and stronger development of the\r\nhard plate which lined his mouth. The prickles of the plate grew\r\nlarger and harder, until--as may be seen to-day in the mouth of a young\r\nshark--the cavity was lined with teeth. In the bulk of the Devonian\r\nsharks these developed into what are significantly called \"pavement\r\nteeth.\" They were solid plates of enamel, an inch or an inch and a half\r\nin width, with which the monster ground its enormous meals of Molluscs,\r\nCrustacea, sea-weed, etc. A new and stimulating element had come into\r\nthe life of the invertebrate world. Other sharks snapped larger victims,\r\nand developed the teeth on the edges of their jaws, to the sacrifice\r\nof the others, until we find these teeth in the course of time solid\r\ntriangular masses of enamel, four or five inches long, with saw-like\r\nedges. Imagine these terrible mouths--the shears of the Arthrodiran,\r\nand the grindstones and terrible crescents of the giant sharks--moving\r\nspeedily amongst the crowded inhabitants of the waters, and it is easy\r\nto see what a stimulus to the attainment of speed and of protective\r\ndevices was given to the whole world of the time.\r\n\r\nWhat was the origin of the fish? Here we are in much the same position\r\nas we were in regard to the origin of the higher Invertebrates. Once\r\nthe fish plainly appears upon the scene it is found to be undergoing a\r\nprocess of evolution like all other animals. The vast majority of our\r\nfishes have bony frames (or are Teleosts); the fishes of the Devonian\r\nage nearly all have frames of cartilage, and we know from embryonic\r\ndevelopment that cartilage is the first stage in the formation of bone.\r\nIn the teeth and tails, also, we find a gradual evolution toward the\r\nhigher types. But the earlier record is, for reasons I have already\r\ngiven, obscure; and as my purpose is rather to discover the agencies\r\nof evolution than to strain slender evidence in drawing up pedigrees, I\r\nneed only make brief reference to the state of the problem.\r\n\r\nUntil comparatively recent times the animal world fell into two clearly\r\ndistinct halves, the Vertebrates and the Invertebrates. There were\r\nseveral anatomical differences between the two provinces, but the most\r\nconspicuous and most puzzling was the backbone. Nowhere in living nature\r\nor in the rocks was any intermediate type known between the backboned\r\nand the non-backboned animal. In the course of the nineteenth century,\r\nhowever, several animals of an intermediate type were found. The\r\nsea-squirt has in its early youth the line of cartilage through the\r\nbody which, in embryonic development, represents the first stage of the\r\nbackbone; the lancelet and the Appendicularia have a rod of cartilage\r\nthroughout life; the \"acorn-headed worm\" shows traces of it. These are\r\nregarded as surviving specimens of various groups of animals which, in\r\nearly times, fell between the Invertebrate and Vertebrate worlds, and\r\nillustrate the transition.\r\n\r\nWith their aid a genealogical tree was constructed for the fish. It was\r\nassumed that some Cambrian or Silurian Annelid obtained this stiffening\r\nrod of cartilage. The next advantage--we have seen it in many cases--was\r\nto combine flexibility with support. The rod was divided into connected\r\nsections (vertebrae), and hardened into bone. Besides stiffening the\r\nbody, it provided a valuable shelter for the spinal cord, and its upper\r\npart expanded into a box to enclose the brain. The fins were formed of\r\nfolds of skin which were thrown off at the sides and on the back, as\r\nthe animal wriggled through the water. They were of use in swimming, and\r\nsections of them were stiffened with rods of cartilage, and became the\r\npairs of fins. Gill slits (as in some of the highest worms) appeared in\r\nthe throat, the mouth was improved by the formation of jaws, and--the\r\nworm culminated in the shark.\r\n\r\nSome experts think, however, that the fish developed directly from a\r\nCrustacean, and hold that the Ostracoderms are the connecting link. A\r\nclose discussion of the anatomical details would be out of place here,\r\n[*] and the question remains open for the present. Directly or\r\nindirectly, the fish is a descendant of some Archaean Annelid. It is\r\nmost probable that the shark was the first true fish-type. There are\r\nunrecognisable fragments of fishes in the Ordovician and Silurian rocks,\r\nbut the first complete skeletons (Lanarkia, etc.) are of small shark-\r\nlike creatures, and the low organisation of the group to which the shark\r\nbelongs, the Elasmobranchs, makes it probable that they are the most\r\nprimitive. Other remains (Palaeospondylus) show that the fish-like\r\nlampreys had already developed.\r\n\r\n     * See, especially, Dr. Gaskell's \"Origin of Vertebrates\"\r\n     (1908).\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo groups were developed from the primitive fish, which have great\r\ninterest for us. Our next step, in fact, is to trace the passage of the\r\nfish from the water to the land, one of the most momentous chapters in\r\nthe story of life. To that incident or accident of primitive life we\r\nowe our own existence and the whole development of the higher types of\r\nanimals. The advance of natural history in modern times has made this\r\npassage to the land easy to understand. Not only does every frog reenact\r\nit in the course of its development, but we know many fishes that\r\ncan live out of water. There is an Indian perch--called the \"climbing\r\nperch,\" but it has only once been seen by a European to climb a\r\ntree--which crosses the fields in search of another pool, when its own\r\npool is evaporating. An Indian marine fish (Periophthalmus) remains\r\nhunting on the shore when the tide goes out. More important still,\r\nseveral fishes have lungs as well as gills. The Ceratodus of certain\r\nQueensland rivers has one lung; though, I was told by the experts in\r\nQueensland, it is not a \"mud-fish,\" and never lives in dry mud. However,\r\nthe Protopterus of Africa and the Lepidosiren of South America have two\r\nlungs, as well as gills, and can live either in water or, in the dry\r\nseason, on land.\r\n\r\nWhen the skeletons of fishes of the Ceratodus type were discovered in\r\nthe Devonian rocks, it was felt that we had found the fish-ancestor of\r\nthe land Vertebrates, but a closer anatomical examination has made this\r\ndoubtful. The Devonian lung-fish has characters which do not seem to\r\nlead on to the Amphibia. The same general cause probably led many groups\r\nto leave the water, or adapt themselves to living on land as well as in\r\nwater, and the abundant Dipoi or Dipneusts (\"double-breathers\") of the\r\nDevonian lakes are one of the chief of these groups, which have\r\nluckily left descendants to our time. The ancestors of the Amphibia\r\nare generally sought amongst the Crossopterygii, a very large group of\r\nfishes in Devonian times, with very few representatives to-day.\r\n\r\nIt is more profitable to investigate the process itself than to make a\r\nprecarious search for the actual fish, and, fortunately, this inquiry\r\nis more hopeful. The remains that we find make it probable that the fish\r\nleft the water about the beginning of the Devonian or the end of the\r\nSilurian. Now this period coincides with two circumstances which throw a\r\ncomplete light on the step; one is the great rise of the land, catching\r\nmyriads of fishes in enclosed inland seas, and the other is the\r\nappearance of formidable carnivores in the waters. As the seas\r\nevaporated [*] and the great carnage proceeded, the land, which was\r\nalready covered with plants and inhabited by insects, offered a safe\r\nretreat for such as could adopt it. Emigration to the land had been\r\ngoing on for ages, as we shall see. Curious as it must seem to the\r\ninexpert, the fishes, or some of them, were better prepared than most\r\nother animals to leave the water. The chief requirement was a lung, or\r\ninterior bag, by which the air could be brought into close contact with\r\nthe absorbing blood vessels. Such a bag, broadly speaking, most of the\r\nfishes possess in their floating-bladder: a bag of gas, by compressing\r\nor expanding which they alter their specific gravity in the water. In\r\nsome fishes it is double; in some it is supplied with blood-vessels; in\r\nsome it is connected by a tube with the gullet, and therefore with the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n     * It is now usually thought that the inland seas were the\r\n     theatre of the passage to land. I must point out, however,\r\n     that the wide distribution of our Dipneusts, in Australia,\r\n     tropical Africa, and South America, suggests that they were\r\n     marine though they now live in fresh water. But we shall see\r\n     that a continent united the three regions at one time, and\r\n     it may afford some explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus we get very clear suggestions of the transition from water to land.\r\nWe must, of course, conceive it as a slow and gradual adaptation.\r\nAt first there may have been a rough contrivance for deriving oxygen\r\ndirectly and partially from the atmosphere, as the water of the lake\r\nbecame impure. So important an advantage would be fostered, and, as\r\nthe inland sea became smaller, or its population larger or fiercer, the\r\nfishes with a sufficiently developed air-breathing apparatus passed to\r\nthe land, where, as yet, they would find no serious enemy. The fact is\r\nbeyond dispute; the theory of how it occurred is plausible enough; the\r\nconsequences were momentous. Great changes were preparing on the land,\r\nand in a comparatively short time we shall find its new inhabitant\r\nsubjected to a fierce test of circumstances that will carry it to an\r\nenormously higher level than life had yet reached.\r\n\r\nI have said that the fact of this transition to the land is beyond\r\ndispute. The evidence is very varied, but need not all be enlarged upon\r\nhere. The widespread Dipneust fishes of the Devonian rocks bear\r\nstrong witness to it, and the appearance of the Amphibian immediately\r\nafterwards makes it certain. The development of the frog is a\r\nreminiscence of it, on the lines of the embryonic law which we saw\r\nearlier. An animal, in its individual development, more or less\r\nreproduces the past phases of its ancestry. So the free-swimming\r\njelly-fish begins life as a fixed polyp; a kind of star-fish (Comatula)\r\nopens its career as a stalked sea-lily; the gorgeous dragon-fly is at\r\nfirst an uncouth aquatic animal, and the ethereal butterfly a worm-like\r\ncreature. But the most singular and instructive of all these embryonic\r\nreminiscences of the past is found in the fact that all the higher\r\nland-animals of to-day clearly reproduce a fish-stage in their embryonic\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nIn the third and fourth weeks of development the human embryo shows four\r\n(closed) slits under the head, with corresponding arches. The bird, the\r\ndog, the horse--all the higher land animals, in a word, pass through the\r\nsame phase. The suggestion has been made that these structures do not\r\nrecall the gill-slits and gill-arches of the fish, but are folds due\r\nto the packing of the embryo in the womb. In point of fact, they appear\r\njust at the time when the human embryo is only a fifth of an inch\r\nlong, and there is no such compression. But all doubt as to their\r\ninterpretation is dispelled when we remove the skin and examine the\r\nheart and blood-vessels. The heart is up in the throat, as in the fish,\r\nand has only two chambers, as in the fish (not four, as in the bird\r\nand mammal); and the arteries rise in five pairs of arches over the\r\nswellings in the throat, as they do in the lower fish, but do not in\r\nthe bird and mammal. The arrangement is purely temporary--lasting only\r\na couple of weeks in the human embryo--and purposeless. Half these\r\narteries will disappear again. They quite plainly exist to supply fine\r\nblood-vessels for breathing at the gill-clefts, and are never used, for\r\nthe embryo does not breathe, except through the mother. They are a most\r\ninstructive reminder of the Devonian fish which quitted its element and\r\nbecame the ancestor of all the birds and mammals of a later age.\r\n\r\nSeveral other features of man's embryonic development--the budding of\r\nthe hind limbs high up, instead of at the base of, the vertebral column,\r\nthe development of the ears, the nose, the jaws, etc.--have the same\r\nlesson, but the one detailed illustration will suffice. The millions of\r\nyears of stimulating change and struggle which we have summarised have\r\nresulted in the production of a fish which walks on four limbs (as the\r\nSouth American mud-fish does to-day), and breathes the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWe have been quite unable to follow the vast changes which have meantime\r\ntaken place in its organisation. The eyes, which were mere pits in\r\nthe skin, lined with pigment cells, in the early worm, now have a\r\ncrystalline lens to concentrate the light and define objects on the\r\nnerve. The ears, which were at first similar sensitive pits in the skin,\r\non which lay a little stone whose movements gave the animal some sense\r\nof direction, are now closed vesicles in the skull, and begin to be\r\nsensitive to waves of sound. The nose, which was at first two blind,\r\nsensitive pits in the skin of the head, now consists of two nostrils\r\nopening into the mouth, with an olfactory nerve spreading richly\r\nover the passages. The brain, which was a mere clump of nerve-cells\r\nconnecting the rough sense-impressions, is now a large and intricate\r\nstructure, and already exhibits a little of that important region (the\r\ncerebrum) in which the varied images of the outside world are combined.\r\nThe heart, which was formerly was a mere swelling of a part of one of\r\nthe blood-vessels, now has two chambers.\r\n\r\nWe cannot pursue these detailed improvements of the mechanism, as we\r\nmight, through the ascending types of animals. Enough if we see more or\r\nless clearly how the changes in the face of the earth and the rise of\r\nits successive dynasties of carnivores have stimulated living things to\r\nhigher and higher levels in the primitive ocean. We pass to the clearer\r\nand far more important story of life on land, pursuing the fish through\r\nits continuous adaptations to new conditions until, throwing out\r\nside-branches as it progresses, it reaches the height of bird and mammal\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. THE COAL-FOREST\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of life on land we open a new and more important\r\nvolume of the story of life, and we may take the opportunity to make\r\nclearer certain principles or processes of development which we may seem\r\nhitherto to have taken for granted. The evolutionary work is too often\r\na mere superficial description of the strange and advancing classes of\r\nplants and animals which cross the stage of geology. Why they change and\r\nadvance is not explained. I have endeavoured to supply this explanation\r\nby putting the successive populations of the earth in their respective\r\nenvironments, and showing the continuous and stimulating effect on them\r\nof changes in those environments. We have thus learned to decipher\r\nsome lines of the decalogue of living nature. \"Thou shalt have a thick\r\narmour,\" \"Thou shalt be speedy,\" \"Thou shalt shelter from the more\r\npowerful,\" are some of the laws of primeval life. The appearance of each\r\nhigher and more destructive type enforces them with more severity; and\r\nin their observance animals branch outward and upward into myriads of\r\ntemporary or permanent forms.\r\n\r\nBut there is no consciousness of law and no idea of evading danger.\r\nThere is not even some mysterious instinct \"telling\" the animal, as\r\nit used to be said, to do certain things. It is, in fact, not strictly\r\naccurate to say that a certain change in the environment stimulates\r\nanimals to advance. Generally speaking, it does not act on the advancing\r\nat all, but on the non-advancing, which it exterminates. The procedure\r\nis simple, tangible, and unconscious. Two invading arms of the sea meet\r\nand pour together their different waters and populations. The habits,\r\nthe foods, and the enemies of many types of animals are changed; the\r\nless fit for the new environment die first, the more fit survive longest\r\nand breed most of the new generation. It is so with men when they\r\nmigrate to a more exacting environment, whether a dangerous trade or\r\na foreign clime. Again, take the case of the introduction of a giant\r\nCephalopod or fish amongst a population of Molluscs and Crustacea. The\r\ntoughest, the speediest, the most alert, the most retiring, or the least\r\nconspicuous, will be the most apt to survive and breed. In hundreds or\r\nthousands of generations there will be an enormous improvement in the\r\narmour, the speed, the sensitiveness, the hiding practices, and the\r\nprotective colours, of the animals which are devoured. The \"natural\r\nselection of the fittest\" really means the \"natural destruction of the\r\nless fit.\"\r\n\r\nThe only point assumed in this is that the young of an animal or plant\r\ntend to differ from each other and from their parents. Darwin was\r\ncontent to take this as a fact of common observation, as it obviously\r\nis, but later science has thrown some light on the causes of these\r\nvariations. In the first place, the germs in the parent's body may\r\nthemselves be subject to struggle and natural selection, and not share\r\nequally in the food-supply. Then, in the case of the higher animals (or\r\nthe majority of animals), there is a clear source of variation in\r\nthe fact that the mature germ is formed of certain elements from two\r\ndifferent parents, four grandparents, and so on. In the case of the\r\nlower animals the germs and larvae float independently in the water,\r\nand are exposed to many influences. Modern embryologists have found,\r\nby experiment, that an alteration of the temperature or the chemical\r\nconsiderable effect on eggs and larvae. Some recent experiments have\r\nshown that such changes may even affect the eggs in the mother's\r\novary. These discoveries are very important and suggestive, because the\r\ngeological changes which we are studying are especially apt to bring\r\nabout changes of temperature and changes in the freshness or saltiness\r\nof water.\r\n\r\nEvolution is, therefore, not a \"mere description\" of the procession of\r\nliving things; it is to a great extent an explanation of the procession.\r\nWhen, however, we come to apply these general principles to certain\r\naspects of the advance in organisation we find fundamental differences\r\nof opinion among biologists, which must be noted. As Sir E. Ray\r\nLankester recently said, it is not at all true that Darwinism is\r\nquestioned in zoology to-day. It is true only that Darwin was not\r\nomniscient or infallible, and some of his opinions are disputed.\r\n\r\nLet me introduce the subject with a particular instance of evolution,\r\nthe flat-fish. This animal has been fitted to survive the terrible\r\nstruggle in the seas by acquiring such a form that it can lie almost\r\nunseen upon the floor of the ocean. The eye on the under side of the\r\nbody would thus be useless, but a glance at a sole or plaice in a\r\nfishmonger's shop will show that this eye has worked upward to the top\r\nof the head. Was the eye shifted by the effort and straining of the\r\nfish, inherited and increased slightly in each generation? Is the\r\nexplanation rather that those fishes in each generation survived and\r\nbred which happened from birth to have a slight variation in that\r\ndirection, though they did not inherit the effect of the parent's effort\r\nto strain the eye? Or ought we to regard this change of structure as\r\nbrought about by a few abrupt and considerable variations on the part\r\nof the young? There you have the three great schools which divide modern\r\nevolutionists: Lamarckism, Weismannism, and Mendelism (or Mutationism).\r\nAll are Darwinians. No one doubts that the flat-fish was evolved from an\r\nordinary fish--the flat-fish is an ordinary fish in its youth--or that\r\nnatural selection (enemies) killed off the old and transitional types\r\nand overlooked (and so favoured) the new. It will be seen that the\r\nlanguage used in this volume is not the particular language of any\r\none of these schools. This is partly because I wish to leave seriously\r\ncontroverted questions open, and partly from a feeling of compromise,\r\nwhich I may explain. [*]\r\n\r\n     * Of recent years another compromise has been proposed\r\n     between the Lamarckians and Weismannists. It would say that\r\n     the efforts of the parent and their effect on the position\r\n     of the eye--in our case--are not inherited, but might be of\r\n     use in sheltering an embryonic variation in the direction of\r\n     a displaced eye.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, the plain issue between the Mendelians and the other two\r\nschools--whether the passage from species to species is brought about\r\nby a series of small variations during a long period or by a few large\r\nvariations (or \"mutations\") in a short period--is open to an obvious\r\ncompromise. It is quite possible that both views are correct, in\r\ndifferent cases, and quite impossible to find the proportion of each\r\nclass of cases. We shall see later that in certain instances where the\r\nconditions of preservation were good we can sometimes trace a perfectly\r\ngradual advance from species to species. Several shellfish have been\r\ntraced in this way, and a sea-urchin in the chalk has been followed,\r\nquite gradually, from one end of a genus to the other. It is significant\r\nthat the advance of research is multiplying these cases. There is no\r\nreason why we may not assume most of the changes of species we have\r\nyet seen to have occurred in this way. In fact, in some of the lower\r\nbranches of the animal world (Radiolaria, Sponges, etc.) there is often\r\nno sharp division of species at all, but a gradual series of living\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand we know many instances of very considerable sudden\r\nchanges. The cases quoted by Mendelists generally belong to the plant\r\nworld, but instances are not unknown in the animal world. A shrimp\r\n(Artemia) was made to undergo considerable modification, by altering the\r\nproportion of salt in the water in which it was kept. Butterflies have\r\nbeen made to produce young quite different from their normal young by\r\nsubjecting them to abnormal temperature, electric currents, and so on;\r\nand, as I said, the most remarkable effects have been produced on eggs\r\nand embryos by altering the chemical and physical conditions. Rats--I\r\nwas informed by the engineer in charge of the refrigerating room on\r\nan Australian liner--very quickly became adapted to the freezing\r\ntemperature by developing long hair. All that we have seen of the past\r\nchanges in the environment of animals makes it probable that these\r\nlarger variations often occur. I would conclude, therefore, that\r\nevolution has proceeded continuously (though by no means universally)\r\nthrough the ages, but there were at times periods of more acute change\r\nwith correspondingly larger changes in the animal and plant worlds.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the issue between the Lamarckians and Weismannists--whether\r\nchanges acquired by the parent are inherited by the young--recent\r\nexperiments again suggest something of a compromise. Weismann says that\r\nthe body of the parent is but the case containing the germ-plasm, so\r\nthat all modifications of the living parent body perish with it, and do\r\nnot affect the germ, which builds the next generation. Certainly, when\r\nwe reflect that the 70,000 ova in the human mother's ovary seem to have\r\nbeen all formed in the first year of her life, it is difficult to see\r\nhow modifications of her muscles or nerves can affect them. Thus we\r\ncannot hope to learn anything, either way, by cutting off the tails of\r\ncows, and experiments of that kind. But it is acknowledged that certain\r\ndiseases in the blood, which nourishes the germs, may affect them, and\r\nrecent experimenters have found that they can reach and affect the germs\r\nin the body by other agencies, and so produce inherited modifications\r\nin the parent. [*] If this claim is sustained and enlarged, it may be\r\nconcluded that the greater changes of environment which we find in the\r\ngeological chronicle may have had a considerable influence of this kind.\r\n\r\n     * See a paper read by Professor Bourne to the Zoological\r\n     Section of the British Association, 1910. It must be\r\n     understood that when I speak of Weismannism I do not refer\r\n     to this whole theory of heredity, which, he acknowledges,\r\n     has few supporters. The Lamarckian view is represented in\r\n     Britain by Sir W. Turner and Professor Darwin. In other\r\n     countries it has a larger proportion of distinguished\r\n     supporters. On the whole subject see Professor J. A.\r\n     Thomson's \"Heredity\" (1909), Dewar and Finn's \"Making of\r\n     Species\" (1909--a Mendelian work), and, for essays by the\r\n     leaders of each school, \"Darwinism and Modern Science\"\r\n     (1909).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general issue, however, must remain open. The Lamarckian and\r\nWeismannist theories are rival interpretations of past events, and we\r\nshall not find it necessary to press either. When the fish comes to\r\nlive on land, for instance, it develops a bony limb out of its fin. The\r\nLamarckian says that the throwing of the weight of the body on the main\r\nstem of the fin strengthens it, as practice strengthens the boxer's arm,\r\nand the effect is inherited and increased in each generation, until\r\nat last the useless paddle of the fin dies away and the main stem\r\nhas become a stout, bony column. Weismann says that the individual\r\nmodification, by use in walking, is not inherited, but those young are\r\nfavoured which have at birth a variation in the strength of the stem of\r\nthe fin. As each of these interpretations is, and must remain, purely\r\ntheoretical, we will be content to tell the facts in such cases. But\r\nthese brief remarks will enable the reader to understand in what precise\r\nsense the facts we record are open to controversy.\r\n\r\nLet us return to the chronicle of the earth. We had reached the Devonian\r\nage, when large continents, with great inland seas, existed in North\r\nAmerica, north-west Europe, and north Asia, probably connected by a\r\ncontinent across the North Atlantic and the Arctic region. South America\r\nand South Africa were emerging, and a continent was preparing to stretch\r\nfrom Brazil, through South Africa and the Antarctic, to Australia and\r\nIndia. The expanse of land was, with many oscillations, gaining on the\r\nwater, and there was much emigration to it from the over-populated seas.\r\nWhen the fish went on land in the Devonian, it must have found a diet\r\n(insects, etc.) there, and the insects must have been preceded by a\r\nplant population. We have first, therefore, to consider the evolution of\r\nthe plant, and see how it increases in form and number until it covers\r\nthe earth with the luxuriant forests of the Carboniferous period.\r\n\r\nThe plant world, we saw, starts, like the animal world, with a great\r\nkingdom of one-celled microscopic representatives, and the same\r\nprinciples of development, to a great extent, shape it into a large\r\nvariety of forms. Armour-plating has a widespread influence among them.\r\nThe graceful Diatom is a morsel of plasm enclosed in a flinty box, often\r\nwith a very pretty arrangement of the pores and markings. The Desmid has\r\na coat of cellulose, and a less graceful coat of cellulose encloses the\r\nPeridinean. Many of these minute plants develop locomotion and a degree\r\nof sensitiveness (Diatoms, Peridinea, Euglena, etc.). Some (Bacteria)\r\nadopt animal diet, and rise in power of movement and sensitiveness until\r\nit is impossible to make any satisfactory distinction between them\r\nand animals. Then the social principle enters. First we have loose\r\nassociations of one-celled plants in a common bed, then closer clusters\r\nor many-celled bodies. In some cases (Volvox) the cluster, or the\r\ncompound plant, is round and moves briskly in the water, closely\r\nresembling an animal. In most cases, the cells are connected in chains,\r\nand we begin to see the vague outline of the larger plant.\r\n\r\nWhen we had reached this stage in the development of animal life, we\r\nfound great difficulty in imagining how the chief lines of the\r\nhigher Invertebrates took their rise from the Archaean chaos of early\r\nmany-celled forms. We have an even greater difficulty here, as plant\r\nremains are not preserved at all until the Devonian period. We can only\r\nconclude, from the later facts, that these primitive many-celled plants\r\nbranched out in several different directions. One section (at a quite\r\nunknown date) adopted an organic diet, and became the Fungi; and a later\r\nco-operation, or life-partnership, between a Fungus and a one-celled\r\nAlga led to the Lichens. Others remained at the Alga-level, and grew in\r\ngreat thickets along the sea bottoms, no doubt rivalling or surpassing\r\nthe giant sea-weeds, sometimes 400 feet long, off the American coast\r\nto-day. Other lines which start from the level of the primitive\r\nmany-celled Algae develop into the Mosses (Bryophyta), Ferns\r\n(Pteridophyta), Horsetails (Equisetalia), and Club-mosses\r\n(Lycopodiales). The mosses, the lowest group, are not preserved in the\r\nrocks; from the other three classes will come the great forests of the\r\nCarboniferous period.\r\n\r\nThe early record of plant-life is so poor that it is useless to\r\nspeculate when the plant first left the water. We have somewhat obscure\r\nand disputed traces of ferns in the Ordovician, and, as they and the\r\nHorsetails and Club-mosses are well developed in the Devonian, we may\r\nassume that some of the sea-weeds had become adapted to life on land,\r\nand evolved into the early forms of the ferns, at least in the Cambrian\r\nperiod. From that time they begin to weave a mantle of sombre green over\r\nthe exposed land, and to play a most important part in the economy of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nWe saw that at the beginning of the Devonian there was a considerable\r\nrise of the land both in America and Europe, but especially in Europe.\r\nA distant spectator at that time would have observed the rise of a chain\r\nof mountains in Scotland and a general emergence of land north-western\r\nEurope. A continent stretched from Ireland to Scandinavia and North\r\nRussia, while most of the rest of Europe, except large areas of Russia,\r\nFrance, Germany, and Turkey, was under the sea. Where we now find our\r\nAlps and Pyrenees towering up to the snow-line there were then level\r\nstretches of ocean. Even the north-western continent was scooped\r\ninto great inland seas or lagoons, which stretched from Ireland to\r\nScandinavia, and, as we saw, fostered the development of the fishes.\r\n\r\nAs the Devonian period progressed the sea gained on the land, and must\r\nhave restricted the growth of vegetation, but as the lake deposits now\r\npreserve the remains of the plants which grow down to their shores, or\r\nare washed into them, we are enabled to restore the complexion of the\r\nlandscape. Ferns, generally of a primitive and generalised character,\r\nabound, and include the ferns such as we find in warm countries to-day.\r\nHorsetails and Club-mosses already grow into forest-trees. There are\r\neven seed-bearing ferns, which give promise of the higher plants to\r\ncome, but as yet nothing approaching our flower and fruit-bearing trees\r\nhas appeared. There is as yet no certain indication of the presence of\r\nConifers. It is a sombre and monotonous vegetation, unlike any to be\r\nfound in any climate to-day.\r\n\r\nWe will look more closely into its nature presently. First let us see\r\nhow these primitive types of plants come to form the immense forests\r\nwhich are recorded in our coal-beds. Dr. Russel Wallace has lately\r\nrepresented these forests, which have, we shall see, had a most\r\nimportant influence on the development of life, as somewhat mysterious\r\nin their origin. If, however, we again consult the geologist as to the\r\nchanges which were taking place in the distribution of land and water,\r\nwe find a quite natural explanation. Indeed, there are now distinguished\r\ngeologists (e.g. Professor Chamberlin) who doubt if the Coal-forests\r\nwere so exceptionally luxuriant as is generally believed. They think\r\nthat the vegetation may not have been more dense than in some other\r\nages, but that there may have been exceptionally good conditions for\r\npreserving the dead trees. We shall see that there were; but, on the\r\nwhole, it seems probable that during some hundreds of thousands of\r\nyears remarkably dense forests covered enormous stretches of the earth's\r\nsurface, from the Arctic to the Antarctic.\r\n\r\nThe Devonian period had opened with a rise of the land, but the sea eat\r\nsteadily into it once more, and, with some inconsiderable oscillations\r\nof the land, regained its territory. The latter part of the Devonian\r\nand earlier part of the Carboniferous were remarkable for their great\r\nexpanses of shallow water and low-lying land. Except the recent chain\r\nof hills in Scotland we know of no mountains. Professor Chamberlin\r\ncalculates that 20,000,000, or 30,000,000 square miles of the present\r\ncontinental surface of Europe and America were covered with a\r\nshallow sea. In the deeper and clearer of these waters the earliest\r\nCarboniferous rocks, of limestone, were deposited. The \"millstone grit,\"\r\nwhich succeeds the \"limestone,\" indicates shallower water, which is\r\nbeing rapidly filled up with the debris of the land. In a word, all the\r\nindications suggest the early and middle Carboniferous as an age of vast\r\nswamps, of enormous stretches of land just above or below the sea-level,\r\nand changing repeatedly from one to the other. Further, the climate\r\nwas at the time--we will consider the general question of climate\r\nlater--moist and warm all over the earth, on account of the great\r\nproportion of sea-surface and the absence of high land (not to speak of\r\nmore disputable causes).\r\n\r\nThese were ideal conditions for the primitive vegetation, and it spread\r\nover the swamps with great vigour. To say that the Coal-forests\r\nwere masses of Ferns, Horsetails, and Club-mosses is a lifeless and\r\nmisleading expression. The Club-mosses, or Lycopodiales, were massive\r\ntrees, rising sometimes to a height of 120 feet, and probably averaging\r\nabout fifty feet in height and one or two feet in diameter. The largest\r\nand most abundant of them, the Sigillaria, sent up a scarred and fluted\r\ntrunk to a height of seventy or a hundred feet, without a branch,\r\nand was crowned with a bunch of its long, tapering leaves. The\r\nLepidodendron, its fellow monarch of the forest, branched at the summit,\r\nand terminated in clusters of its stiff, needle-like leaves, six' or\r\nseven inches long, like enormous exaggerations of the little cones at\r\nthe ends of our Club-mosses to-day. The Horsetails, which linger\r\nin their dwarfed descendants by our streams to-day, and at their\r\nexceptional best (in a part of South America) form slender stems\r\nabout thirty feet high, were then forest-trees, four to six feet in\r\ncircumference and sometimes ninety feet in height. These Calamites\r\nprobably rose in dense thickets from the borders of the lakes, their\r\nstumpy leaves spreading in whorls at every joint in their hollow\r\nstems. Another extinct tree, the Cordaites, rivalled the Horsetails and\r\nClub-mosses in height, and its showers of long and extraordinary leaves,\r\nsix feet long and six inches in width, pointed to the higher plant\r\nworld that was to come. Between these gaunt towering trunks the graceful\r\ntree-ferns spread their canopies at heights of twenty, forty, and even\r\nsixty feet from the ground, and at the base was a dense undergrowth\r\nof ferns and fern-like seed-plants. Mosses may have carpeted the moist\r\nground, but nothing in the nature of grass or flowers had yet appeared.\r\n\r\nImagine this dense assemblage of dull, flowerless trees pervaded by a\r\nhot, dank atmosphere, with no change of seasons, with no movement\r\nbut the flying of large and primitive insects among the trees and the\r\nstirring of the ferns below by some passing giant salamander, with no\r\nsong of bird and no single streak of white or red or blue drawn across\r\nthe changeless sombre green, and you have some idea of the character of\r\nthe forests that are compressed into our seams of coal. Imagine these\r\nforests spread from Spitzbergen to Australia and even, according to the\r\nsouth polar expeditions, to the Antarctic, and from the United States to\r\nEurope, to Siberia, and to China, and prolonged during some hundreds\r\nof thousands of years, and you begin to realise that the Carboniferous\r\nperiod prepared the land for the coming dynasties of animals. Let some\r\nvast and terrible devastation fall upon this luxuriant world, entombing\r\nthe great multitude of its imperfect forms and selecting the higher\r\ntypes for freer life, and the earth will pass into a new age.\r\n\r\nBut before we describe the animal inhabitants of these forests, the\r\npart that the forests play in the story of life, and the great cataclysm\r\nwhich selects the higher types from the myriads of forms which the\r\nwarm womb of the earth has poured out, we must at least glance at the\r\nevolutionary position of the Carboniferous plants themselves. Do they\r\npoint downward to lower forms, and upward to higher forms, as the theory\r\nof evolution requires? A close inquiry into this would lead us deep into\r\nthe problems of the modern botanist, but we may borrow from him a few\r\nof the results of the great labour he has expended on the subject within\r\nthe last decade.\r\n\r\nJust as the animal world is primarily divided into Invertebrates and\r\nVertebrates, the plant world is primarily divided into a lower kingdom\r\nof spore-bearing plants (the Cryptogams) and an upper kingdom of\r\nseed-bearing plants (the Phanerogams). Again, just as the first half of\r\nthe earth's story is the age of Invertebrate animals, so it is the age\r\nof Cryptogamous plants. So far evolution was always justified in the\r\nplant record. But there is a third parallel, of much greater interest.\r\nWe saw that at one time the evolutionist was puzzled by the clean\r\ndivision of animals into Invertebrate and Vertebrate, and the sudden\r\nappearance of the backbone in the chronicle: he was just as much puzzled\r\nby the sharp division of our plants into Cryptogams and Phanerogams, and\r\nthe sudden appearance of the latter on the earth during the Coal-forest\r\nperiod. And the issue has been a fresh and recent triumph for evolution.\r\n\r\nPlants are so well preserved in the coal that many years of microscopic\r\nstudy of the remains, and patient putting-together of the crushed and\r\nscattered fragments, have shown the Carboniferous plants in quite a new\r\nlight. Instead of the Coal-forest being a vast assemblage of Cryptogams,\r\nupon which the higher type of the Phanerogam is going suddenly to\r\ndescend from the clouds, it is, to a very great extent, a world of\r\nplants that are struggling upward, along many paths, to the higher\r\nlevel. The characters of the Cryptogam and Phanerogam are so mixed up\r\nin it that, although the special lines of development are difficult to\r\ntrace, it is one massive testimony to the evolution of the higher\r\nfrom the lower. The reproductive bodies of the great Lepidodendra are\r\nsometimes more like seeds than spores, while both the wood and the\r\nleaves of the Sigillaria have features which properly belong to the\r\nPhanerogam. In another group (called the Sphenophyllales) the characters\r\nof these giant Club-mosses are blended with the characters of the giant\r\nHorsetails, and there is ground to think that the three groups have\r\ndescended from an earlier common ancestor.\r\n\r\nFurther, it is now believed that a large part of what were believed to\r\nbe Conifers, suddenly entering from the unknown, are not Conifers at\r\nall, but Cordaites. The Cordaites is a very remarkable combination of\r\nfeatures that are otherwise scattered among the Cryptogams, Cycads, and\r\nConifers. On the other hand, a very large part of what the geologist had\r\nhitherto called \"Ferns\" have turned out to be seed-bearing plants, half\r\nCycad and half Fern. Numbers of specimens of this interesting group--the\r\nCycadofilices (cycad-ferns) or Pteridosperms (seed-ferns)--have been\r\nbeautifully restored by our botanists. [*] They have afforded a new and\r\nvery plausible ancestor for the higher trees which come on the scene\r\ntoward the close of the Coal-forests, while their fern-like characters\r\ndispose botanists to think that they and the Ferns may be traced to a\r\ncommon ancestor. This earlier stage is lost in those primitive ages from\r\nwhich not a single leaf has survived in the rocks. We can only say\r\nthat it is probable that the Mosses, Ferns, Lycopods, etc., arose\r\nindependently from the primitive level. But the higher and more\r\nimportant development is now much clearer. The Coal-forest is not simply\r\na kingdom of Cryptogams. It is a world of aspiring and mingled types.\r\nLet it be subjected to some searching test, some tremendous spell of\r\nadversity, and we shall understand the emergence of the higher types out\r\nof the luxuriant profusion and confusion of forms.\r\n\r\n     * See, especially, D. H. Scott, \"Studies of Fossil Botany\"\r\n     (2nd ed., 1908), and \"The Evolution of Plants\" (1910--small\r\n     popular manual).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. THE ANIMALS OF THE COAL-FOREST\r\n\r\nWe have next to see that when this period of searching adversity\r\ncomes--as it will in the next chapter--the animal world also offers a\r\nluxuriant variety of forms from which the higher types may be selected.\r\nThis, it need hardly be said, is just what we find in the geological\r\nrecord. The fruitful, steaming, rich-laden earth now offered tens of\r\nmillions of square miles of pasture to vegetal feeders; the waters, on\r\nthe other hand, teemed with gigantic sharks, huge Cephalopods, large\r\nscorpion-like and lobster-like animals, and shoals of armour-plated,\r\nhard-toothed fishes. Successive swarms of vegetarians--Worms, Molluscs,\r\netc.--followed the plant on to the land; and swarms of carnivores\r\nfollowed the vegetarians, and assumed strange, new forms in adaptation\r\nto land-life. The migration had probably proceeded throughout the\r\nDevonian period, especially from the calmer shores of the inland seas.\r\nBy the middle of the Coal-forest period there was a very large and\r\nvaried animal population on the land. Like the plants, moreover,\r\nthese animals were of an intermediate and advancing nature. No bird or\r\nbutterfly yet flits from tree to tree; no mammal rears its young in the\r\nshelter of the ferns. But among the swarming population are many types\r\nthat show a beginning of higher organisation, and there is a rich and\r\nvaried material provided for the coming selection.\r\n\r\nThe monarch of the Carboniferous forest is the Amphibian. In that age\r\nof spreading swamps and \"dim, watery woodlands,\" the stupid and sluggish\r\nAmphibian finds his golden age, and, except perhaps the scorpion,\r\nthere is no other land animal competent to dispute his rule. Even the\r\nscorpion, moreover, would not find the Carboniferous Amphibian very\r\nvulnerable. We must not think of the smooth-skinned frogs and toads and\r\ninnocent newts which to-day represent the fallen race of the Amphibia.\r\nThey were then heavily armoured, powerfully armed, and sometimes as\r\nlarge as alligators or young crocodiles. It is a characteristic of\r\nadvancing life that a new type of organism has its period of triumph,\r\ngrows to enormous proportions, and spreads into many different types,\r\nuntil the next higher stage of life is reached, and it is dethroned by\r\nthe new-comers.\r\n\r\nThe first indication--apart from certain disputed impressions in the\r\nDevonian--of the land-vertebrate is the footprint of an Amphibian on an\r\nearly Carboniferous mud-flat. Hardened by the sun, and then covered with\r\na fresh deposit when it sank beneath the waters, it remains to-day\r\nto witness the arrival of the five-toed quadruped who was to rule the\r\nearth. As the period proceeds, remains are found in great abundance,\r\nand we see that there must have been a vast and varied population of the\r\nAmphibia on the shores of the Carboniferous lagoons and swamps. There\r\nwere at least twenty genera of them living in what is now the island of\r\nBritain, and was then part of the British-Scandinavian continent. Some\r\nof them were short and stumpy creatures, a few inches long, with weak\r\nlimbs and short tails, and broad, crescent-shaped heads, their\r\nbodies clothed in the fine scaly armour of their fish-ancestor (the\r\nBranchiosaurs). Some (the Aistopods) were long, snake-like creatures,\r\nwith shrunken limbs and bodies drawn out until, in some cases, the\r\nbackbone had 150 vertebrae. They seem to have taken to the thickets, in\r\nthe growing competition, as the serpents did later, and lost the use of\r\ntheir limbs, which would be merely an encumbrance in winding among\r\nthe roots and branches. Some (the Microsaurs) were agile little\r\nsalamander-like organisms, with strong, bony frames and relatively long\r\nand useful legs; they look as if they may even have climbed the trees in\r\npursuit of snails and insects. A fourth and more formidable sub-order,\r\nthe Labyrinthodonts--which take their name from the labyrinthine folds\r\nof the enamel in their strong teeth--were commonly several feet in\r\nlength. Some of them attained a length of seven or eight feet, and had\r\nplates of bone over their heads and bellies, while the jaws in their\r\nenormous heads were loaded with their strong, labyrinthine teeth. Life\r\non land was becoming as eventful and stimulating as life in the waters.\r\n\r\nThe general characteristic of these early Amphibia is that they very\r\nclearly retain the marks of their fish ancestry. All of them have tails;\r\nall of them have either scales or (like many of the fishes) plates of\r\nbone protecting the body. In some of the younger specimens the gills can\r\nstill be clearly traced, but no doubt they were mainly lung-animals. We\r\nhave seen how the fish obtained its lungs, and need add only that this\r\nchange in the method of obtaining oxygen for the blood involved certain\r\nfurther changes of a very important nature. Following the fossil\r\nrecord, we do not observe the changes which are taking place in the\r\nsoft internal organs, but we must not lose sight of them. The heart, for\r\ninstance, which began as a simple muscular expansion or distension of\r\none of the blood-vessels of some primitive worm, then doubled and\r\nbecame a two-chambered pump in the fish, now develops a partition in\r\nthe auricle (upper chamber), so that the aerated blood is to some extent\r\nseparated from the venous blood. This approach toward the warm-blooded\r\ntype begins in the \"mud-fish,\" and is connected with the development\r\nof the lungs. Corresponding changes take place in the arteries, and we\r\nshall find that this change in structure is of very great importance in\r\nthe evolution of the higher types of land-life. The heart of the higher\r\nland-animals, we may add, passes through these stages in its embryonic\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nExternally the chief change in the Amphibian is the appearance of\r\ndefinite legs. The broad paddle of the fin is now useless, and its main\r\nstem is converted into a jointed, bony limb, with a five-toed foot,\r\nspreading into a paddle, at the end. But the legs are still feeble,\r\nsprawling supports, letting the heavy body down almost to the ground.\r\nThe Amphibian is an imperfect, but necessary, stage in evolution. It is\r\nan improvement on the Dipneust fish, which now begins to dwindle very\r\nconsiderably in the geological record, but it is itself doomed to give\r\nway speedily before one of its more advanced descendants, the Reptile.\r\nProbably the giant salamander of modern Japan affords the best\r\nsuggestion of the large and primitive salamanders of the Coal-forest,\r\nwhile the Caecilia--snake-like Amphibia with scaly skins, which live\r\nunderground in South America--may not impossibly be degenerate survivors\r\nof the curious Aistopods.\r\n\r\nOur modern tailless Amphibia, frogs and toads, appear much later in the\r\nstory of the earth, but they are not without interest here on account of\r\nthe remarkable capacity which they show to adapt themselves to different\r\nsurroundings. There are frogs, like the tree-frog of Martinique, and\r\nothers in regions where water is scarce, which never pass through the\r\ntadpole stage; or, to be quite accurate, they lose the gills and tail in\r\nthe egg, as higher land-animals do. On the other hand, there is a modern\r\nAmphibian, the axolotl of Mexico, which retains the gills throughout\r\nlife, and never lives on land. Dr. Gadow has shown that the lake in\r\nwhich it lives is so rich in food that it has little inducement to leave\r\nit for the land. Transferred to a different environment, it may pass to\r\nthe land, and lose its gills. These adaptations help us to understand\r\nthe rich variety of Amphibian forms that appeared in the changing\r\nconditions of the Carboniferous world.\r\n\r\nWhen we think of the diet of the Amphibia we are reminded of the other\r\nprominent representatives of land life at the time. Snails, spiders, and\r\nmyriapods crept over the ground or along the stalks of the trees, and a\r\nvast population of insects filled the air. We find a few stray wings in\r\nthe Silurian, and a large number of wings and fragments in the Devonian,\r\nbut it is in the Coal-forest that we find the first great expansion of\r\ninsect life, with a considerable development of myriapods, spiders, and\r\nscorpions. Food was enormously abundant, and the insect at least had no\r\nrival in the air, for neither bird nor flying reptile had yet appeared.\r\nHence we find the same generous growth as amongst the Amphibia.\r\nLarge primitive \"may-flies\" had wings four or five inches long; great\r\nlocust-like creatures had fat bodies sometimes twenty inches in length,\r\nand soared on wings of remarkable breadth, or crawled on their six long,\r\nsprawling legs. More than a thousand species of insects, and nearly\r\na hundred species of spiders and fifty of myriapods, are found in the\r\nremains of the Coal-forests.\r\n\r\nFrom the evolutionary point of view these new classes are as obscure in\r\ntheir origin, yet as manifestly undergoing evolution when they do\r\nfully appear, as the earlier classes we have considered. All are of a\r\nprimitive and generalised character; that is to say, characters\r\nwhich are to-day distributed among widely different groups were then\r\nconcentrated and mingled in one common ancestor, out of which the later\r\ngroups will develop. All belong to the lowest orders of their class. No\r\nHymenopters (ants, bees, and wasps) or Coleopters (beetles) are found\r\nin the Coal-forest; and it will be many millions of years before the\r\ngraceful butterfly enlivens the landscapes of the earth. The early\r\ninsects nearly all belong to the lower orders of the Orthopters\r\n(cockroaches, crickets, locusts, etc.) and Neuropters (dragon-flies,\r\nmay-flies, etc.). A few traces of Hemipters (now mainly represented by\r\nthe degenerate bugs) are found, but nine-tenths of the Carboniferous\r\ninsects belong to the lowest orders of their class, the Orthopters and\r\nNeuropters. In fact, they are such primitive and generalised insects,\r\nand so frequently mingle the characteristics of the two orders, that\r\none of the highest authorities, Scudder, groups them in a special\r\nand extinct order, the Palmodictyoptera; though this view is not now\r\ngenerally adopted. We shall find the higher orders of insects making\r\ntheir appearance in succession as the story proceeds.\r\n\r\nThus far, then, the insects of the Coal-forest are in entire harmony\r\nwith the principle of evolution, but when we try to trace their origin\r\nand earlier relations our task is beset with difficulties. It goes\r\nwithout saying that such delicate frames as those of the earlier insects\r\nhad very little chance of being preserved in the rocks until the special\r\nconditions of the forest-age set in. We are, therefore, quite prepared\r\nto hear that the geologist cannot give us the slenderest information.\r\nHe finds the wing of what he calls \"the primitive bug\" (Protocimex),\r\nan Hemipterous insect, in the later Ordovician, and the wing of a\r\n\"primitive cockroach\" (Palaeoblattina) in the Silurian. From these we\r\ncan merely conclude that insects were already numerous and varied. But\r\nwe have already, in similar difficulties, received assistance from the\r\nscience of zoology, and we now obtain from that science a most important\r\nclue to the evolution of the insect.\r\n\r\nIn South America, South Africa, and Australasia, which were at one\r\ntime connected by a great southern continent, we find a little\r\ncaterpillar-like creature which the zoologist regards with profound\r\ninterest. It is so curious that he has been obliged to create a special\r\nclass for it alone--a distinction which will be appreciated when I\r\nmention that the neighbouring class of the insects contains more than a\r\nquarter of a million living species. This valuable little animal, with\r\nits tiny head, round, elongated body, and many pairs of caterpillar-like\r\nlegs, was until a few decades ago regarded as an Annelid (like the\r\nearth-worm). It has, in point of fact, the peculiar kidney-structures\r\n(nephridia) and other features of the Annelid, but a closer study\r\ndiscovered in it a character that separated it far from any worm-group.\r\nIt was found to breathe the air by means of tracheae (little tubes\r\nrunning inward from the surface of the body), as the myriapods, spiders,\r\nand insects do. It was, in other words, \"a kind of half-way animal\r\nbetween the Arthropods and the Annelids\" (\"Cambridge Natural History,\"\r\niv, p. 5), a surviving kink in the lost chain of the ancestry of the\r\ninsect. Through millions of years it has preserved a primitive frame\r\nthat really belongs to the Cambrian, if not an earlier, age. It is one\r\nof the most instructive \"living fossils\" in the museum of nature.\r\n\r\nPeripatus, as the little animal is called, points very clearly to an\r\nAnnelid ancestor of all the Tracheates (the myriapods, spiders, and\r\ninsects), or all the animals that breathe by means of trachere. To\r\nunderstand its significance we must glance once more at an early chapter\r\nin the story of life. We saw that a vast and varied wormlike population\r\nmust have filled the Archaean ocean, and that all the higher lines of\r\nanimal development start from one or other point in this broad kingdom.\r\nThe Annelids, in which the body consists of a long series of connected\r\nrings or segments, as in the earth-worm, are one of the highest groups\r\nof these worm-like creatures, and some branch of them developed a pair\r\nof feet (as in the caterpillar) on each segment of the body and a\r\ntough, chitinous coat. Thus arose the early Arthropods, on tough-coated,\r\njointed, articulated animals. Some of these remained in the water,\r\nbreathing by means of gills, and became the Crustacea. Some,\r\nhowever, migrated to the land and developed what we may almost call\r\n\"lungs\"--little tubes entering the body at the skin and branching\r\ninternally, to bring the air into contact with the blood, the tracheae.\r\n\r\nIn Peripatus we have a strange survivor of these primitive\r\nAnnelid-Tracheates of many million years ago. The simple nature of its\r\nbreathing apparatus suggests that the trachere were developed out of\r\nglands in the skin; just as the fish, when it came on land, probably\r\ndeveloped lungs from its swimming bladders. The primitive Tracheates,\r\ndelivered from the increasing carnivores of the waters, grew into\r\na large and varied family, as all such new types do in favourable\r\nsurroundings. From them in the course of time were evolved the three\r\ngreat classes of the Myriapods (millipedes and centipedes), the\r\nArachnids (scorpions, spiders, and mites), and the Insects. I will\r\nnot enter into the much-disputed and Obscure question of their nearer\r\nrelationship. Some derive the Insects from the Myriapods, some the\r\nMyriapods from the Insects, and some think they evolved independently;\r\nwhile the rise of the spiders and scorpions is even more obscure.\r\n\r\nBut how can we see any trace of an Annelid ancestor in the vastly\r\ndifferent frames of these animals which are said to descend from it? It\r\nis not so difficult as it seems to be at first sight. In the Myriapod\r\nwe still have the elongated body and successive pairs of legs. In\r\nthe Arachnid the legs are reduced in number and lengthened, while the\r\nvarious segments of the body are fused in two distinct body-halves, the\r\nthorax and the abdomen. In the Insect we have a similar concentration\r\nof the primitive long body. The abdomen is composed of a large number\r\n(usually nine or ten) of segments which have lost their legs and fused\r\ntogether. In the thorax three segments are still distinctly traceable,\r\nwith three pairs of legs--now long jointed limbs--as in the caterpillar\r\nancestor; in the Carboniferous insect these three joints in the thorax\r\nare particularly clear. In the head four or five segments are fused\r\ntogether. Their limbs have been modified into the jaws or other\r\nmouth-appendages, and their separate nerve-centres have combined to form\r\nthe large ring of nerve-matter round the gullet which represents the\r\nbrain of the insect.\r\n\r\nHow, then, do we account for the wings of the insect? Here we can\r\noffer nothing more than speculation, but the speculation is not without\r\ninterest. It may be laid down in principle that the flying animal begins\r\nas a leaping animal. The \"flying fish\" may serve to suggest an early\r\nstage in the development of wings; it is a leaping fish, its extended\r\nfins merely buoying it, like the surfaces of an aeroplane, and so\r\nprolonging its leap away from its pursuer. But the great difficulty is\r\nto imagine any part of the smooth-coated primitive insect, apart from\r\nthe limbs (and the wings of the insect are not developed from legs,\r\nlike those of the bird), which might have even an initial usefulness in\r\nbuoying the body as it leaped. It has been suggested, therefore, that\r\nthe primitive insect returned to the water, as the whale and seal did\r\nin the struggle for life of a later period. The fact that the mayfly and\r\ndragon-fly spend their youth in the water is thought to confirm this.\r\nReturning to the water, the primitive insects would develop gills, like\r\nthe Crustacea. After a time the stress of life in the water drove them\r\nback to the land, and the gills became useless. But the folds or\r\nscales of the tough coat, which had covered the gills, would remain as\r\nprojecting planes, and are thought to have been the rudiment from\r\nwhich a long period of selection evolved the huge wings of the early\r\ndragon-flies and mayflies. It is generally believed that the wingless\r\norder of insects (Aptera) have not lost, but had never developed, wings,\r\nand that the insects with only one or two pairs all descend from an\r\nancestor with three pairs.\r\n\r\nThe early date of their origin, the delicacy of their structure, and\r\nthe peculiar form which their larval development has generally assumed,\r\ncombine to obscure the evolution of the insect, and we must be content\r\nfor the present with these general indications. The vast unexplored\r\nregions of Africa, South America, and Central Australia, may yet yield\r\nfurther clues, and the riddle of insect-metamorphosis may some day\r\nbetray the secrets which it must hold. For the moment the Carboniferous\r\ninsects interest us as a rich material for the operation of a coming\r\nnatural selection. On them, as on all other Carboniferous life, a great\r\ntrial is about to fall. A very small proportion of them will survive\r\nthat trial, and they trill be the better organised to maintain\r\nthemselves and rear their young in the new earth.\r\n\r\nThe remaining land-life of the Coal-forest is confined to worm-like\r\norganisms whose remains are not preserved, and land-snails which do\r\nnot call for further discussion. We may, in conclusion, glance at the\r\nprogress of life in the waters. Apart from the appearance of the\r\ngreat fishes and Crustacea, the Carboniferous period was one of great\r\nstimulation to aquatic life. Constant changes were taking place in the\r\nlevel and the distribution of land and water. The aspect of our coal\r\nseams to-day, alternating between thick layers of sand and mud, shows\r\na remarkable oscillation of the land. Many recent authorities have\r\nquestioned whether the trees grew on the sites where we find them\r\nto-day, and were not rather washed down into the lagoons and shallow\r\nwaters from higher ground. In that case we could not too readily imagine\r\nthe forest-clad region sinking below the waves, being buried under the\r\ndeposits of the rivers, and then emerging, thousands of years later, to\r\nreceive once more the thick mantle of sombre vegetation. Probably\r\nthere was less rising and falling of the crust than earlier geologists\r\nimagined. But, as one of the most recent and most critical authorities,\r\nProfessor Chamberlin, observes, the comparative purity of the coal, the\r\nfairly uniform thickness of the seams, the bed of clay representing\r\nsoil at their base, the frequency with which the stumps are still found\r\ngrowing upright (as in the remarkable exposed Coal-forest surface in\r\nGlasgow, at the present ground-level), [*] the perfectly preserved fronds\r\nand the general mixture of flora, make it highly probable that the\r\ncoal-seam generally marks the actual site of a Coal-forest, and there\r\nwere considerable vicissitudes in the distribution of land and water.\r\nGreat areas of land repeatedly passed beneath the waters, instead of a\r\nre-elevation of the land, however, we may suppose that the shallow water\r\nwas gradually filled with silt and debris from the land, and a fresh\r\nforest grew over it.\r\n\r\n     * The civic authorities of Glasgow have wisely exposed and\r\n     protected this instructive piece of Coal-forest in one of\r\n     their parks. I noticed, however that in the admirable\r\n     printed information they supply to the public, they describe\r\n     the trees as \"at least several hundred thousand years old.\"\r\n     There is no authority in the world who would grant less than\r\n     ten million years since the Coal-forest period.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese changes are reflected in the progress of marine life, though their\r\ninfluence is probably less than that of the great carnivorous monsters\r\nwhich now fill the waters. The heavy Arthrodirans languish and\r\ndisappear. The \"pavement-toothed\" sharks, which at first represent\r\nthree-fourths of the Elasmobranchs, dwindle in turn, and in the\r\nformidable spines which develop on them we may see evidence of the great\r\nstruggle with the sharp-toothed sharks which are displacing them. The\r\nOstracoderms die out in the presence of these competitors. The smaller\r\nfishes (generally Crossopterygii) seem to live mainly in the inland and\r\nshore waters, and advance steadily toward the modern types, but none of\r\nour modern bony fishes have yet appeared.\r\n\r\nMore evident still is the effect of the new conditions upon the\r\nCrustacea. The Trilobite, once the master of the seas, slowly yields\r\nto the stronger competitors, and the latter part of the Carboniferous\r\nperiod sees the last genus of Trilobites finally extinguished. The\r\nEurypterids (large scorpion-like Crustacea, several feet long) suffer\r\nequally, and are represented by a few lingering species. The stress\r\nfavours the development of new and more highly organised Crustacea. One\r\nis the Limulus or \"king-crab,\" which seems to be a descendant, or near\r\nrelative, of the Trilobite, and has survived until modern times. Others\r\nannounce the coming of the long-tailed Crustacea, of the lobster and\r\nshrimp type. They had primitive representatives in the earlier periods,\r\nbut seem to have been overshadowed by the Trilobites and Eurypterids. As\r\nthese in turn are crushed, the more highly organised Malacostraca take\r\nthe lead, and primitive specimens of the shrimp and lobster make their\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThe Echinoderms are still mainly represented by the sea-lilies. The\r\nrocks which are composed of their remains show that vast areas of the\r\nsea-floor must have been covered with groves of sea-lilies, bending on\r\ntheir long, flexible stalks and waving their great flower-like arms in\r\nthe water to attract food. With them there is now a new experiment in\r\nthe stalked Echinoderm, the Blastoid, an armless type; but it seems to\r\nhave been a failure. Sea-urchins are now found in the deposits,\r\nand, although their remains are not common, we may conclude that the\r\nstar-fishes were scattered over the floor of the sea.\r\n\r\nFor the rest we need only observe that progress and rich diversity of\r\nforms characterise the other groups of animals. The Corals now form\r\ngreat reefs, and the finer Corals are gaining upon the coarser. The\r\nForaminifers (the chalk-shelled, one-celled animals) begin to form thick\r\nrocks with their dead skeletons; the Radiolaria (the flinty-shelled\r\nmicrobes) are so abundant that more than twenty genera of them have been\r\ndistinguished in Cornwall and Devonshire. The Brachiopods and Molluscs\r\nstill abound, but the Molluscs begin to outnumber the lower type of\r\nshell-fish. In the Cephalopods we find an increasing complication of the\r\nstructure of the great spiral-shelled types.\r\n\r\nSuch is the life of the Carboniferous period. The world rejoices in a\r\ntropical luxuriance. Semi-tropical vegetation is found in Spitzbergen\r\nand the Antarctic, as well as in North Europe, Asia, and America, and in\r\nAustralasia; corals and sea-lilies flourish at any part of the earth's\r\nsurface. Warm, dank, low-lying lands, bathed by warm oceans and steeped\r\nin their vapours, are the picture suggested--as we shall see more\r\nclosely--to the minds of all geologists. In those happy conditions the\r\nprimitive life of the earth erupts into an abundance and variety that\r\nare fitly illustrated in the well-preserved vegetation of the forest.\r\nAnd when the earth has at length flooded its surface with this seething\r\ntide of life; when the air is filled with a thousand species of insects,\r\nand the forest-floor feels the heavy tread of the giant salamander and\r\nthe light feet of spiders, scorpions, centipedes, and snails, and the\r\nlagoons and shores teem with animals, the Golden Age begins to close,\r\nand all the semi-tropical luxuriance is banished. A great doom is\r\npronounced on the swarming life of the Coal-forest period, and from\r\nevery hundred species of its animals and plants only two or three will\r\nsurvive the searching test.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. THE PERMIAN REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nIn an earlier chapter it was stated that the story of life is a story\r\nof gradual and continuous advance, with occasional periods of more rapid\r\nprogress. Hitherto it has been, in these pages, a slow and even advance\r\nfrom one geological age to another, one level of organisation to\r\nanother. This, it is true, must not be taken too literally. Many\r\na period of rapid change is probably contained, and blurred out of\r\nrecognition, in that long chronicle of geological events. When a region\r\nsinks slowly below the waves, no matter how insensible the subsidence\r\nmay be, there will often come a time of sudden and vast inundations, as\r\nthe higher ridges of the coast just dip below the water-level and the\r\nlower interior is flooded. When two invading arms of the sea meet at\r\nlast in the interior of the sinking continent, or when a land-barrier\r\nthat has for millions of years separated two seas and their populations\r\nis obliterated, we have a similar occurrence of sudden and far-reaching\r\nchange. The whole story of the earth is punctuated with small\r\ncataclysms. But we now come to a change so penetrating, so widespread,\r\nand so calamitous that, in spite of its slowness, we may venture to call\r\nit a revolution.\r\n\r\nIndeed, we may say of the remaining story of the earth that it is\r\ncharacterised by three such revolutions, separated by millions of years,\r\nwhich are very largely responsible for the appearance of higher types of\r\nlife. The facts are very well illustrated by an analogy drawn from the\r\nrecent and familiar history of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe socio-political conditions of Europe in the eighteenth century,\r\nwhich were still tainted with feudalism, were changed into the\r\nsocio-political conditions of the modern world, partly by a slow and\r\ncontinuous evolution, but much more by three revolutionary movements.\r\nFirst there was the great upheaval at the end of the eighteenth century,\r\nthe tremors of which were felt in the life of every country in Europe.\r\nThen, although, as Freeman says, no part of Europe ever returned\r\nentirely to its former condition, there was a profound and almost\r\nuniversal reaction. In the 'thirties and 'forties, differing in\r\ndifferent countries, a second revolutionary disturbance shook Europe.\r\nThe reaction after this upheaval was far less severe, and the conditions\r\nwere permanently changed to a great extent, but a third revolutionary\r\nmovement followed in the next generation, and from that time the\r\nevolution of socio-political conditions has proceeded more evenly.\r\n\r\nThe story of life on the earth since the Coal-forest period is\r\nsimilarly quickened by three revolutions. The first, at the close of\r\nthe Carboniferous period, is the subject of this chapter. It is the most\r\ndrastic and devastating of the three, but its effect, at least on the\r\nanimal world, will be materially checked by a profound and protracted\r\nreaction. At the end of the Chalk period, some millions of years later,\r\nthere will be a second revolution, and it will have a far more enduring\r\nand conspicuous result, though it seem less drastic at the time. Yet\r\nthere will be something of a reaction after a time, and at length\r\na third revolution will inaugurate the age of man. If it is clearly\r\nunderstood that instead of a century we are contemplating a period of at\r\nleast ten million years, and instead of a decade of revolution we have\r\na change spread over a hundred thousand years or more, this analogy will\r\nserve to convey a most important truth.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary agency that broke into the comparatively even\r\nchronicle of life near the close of the Carboniferous period, dethroned\r\nits older types of organisms, and ushered new types to the lordship of\r\nthe earth, was cold. The reader will begin to understand why I dwelt\r\non the aspect of the Coal-forest and its surrounding waters. There\r\nwas, then, a warm, moist earth from pole to pole, not even temporarily\r\nchilled and stiffened by a few months of winter, and life spread\r\nluxuriantly in the perpetual semi-tropical summer. Then a spell of cold\r\nso severe and protracted grips the earth that glaciers glitter on the\r\nflanks of Indian and Australian hills, and fields of ice spread over\r\nwhat are now semitropical regions. In some degree the cold penetrates\r\nthe whole earth. The rich forests shrink slowly into thin tracts of\r\nscrubby, poverty-stricken vegetation. The loss of food and the bleak and\r\nexacting conditions of the new earth annihilate thousands of species\r\nof the older organisms, and the more progressive types are moulded into\r\nfitness for the new environment. It is a colossal application of natural\r\nselection, and amongst its results are some of great moment.\r\n\r\nIn various recent works one reads that earlier geologists, led astray by\r\nthe nebular theory of the earth's origin, probably erred very materially\r\nin regard to the climate of primordial times, and that climate has\r\nvaried less than used to be supposed. It must not be thought that, in\r\nspeaking of a \"Permian revolution,\" I am ignoring or defying this view\r\nof many distinguished geologists. I am taking careful account of it.\r\nThere is no dispute, however, about the fact that the Permian age\r\nwitnessed an immense carnage of Carboniferous organisms, and a very\r\nconsiderable modification of those organisms which survived the\r\ncatastrophe, and that the great agency in this annihilation and\r\ntransformation was cold. To prevent misunderstanding, nevertheless, it\r\nwill be useful to explain the controversy about the climate of the earth\r\nin past ages which divides modern geologists.\r\n\r\nThe root of the difference of opinion and the character of the\r\nconflicting parties have already been indicated. It is a protest of the\r\n\"Planetesimalists\" against the older, and still general, view of the\r\norigin of the earth. As we saw, that view implies that, as the heavier\r\nelements penetrated centreward in the condensing nebula, the gases were\r\nleft as a surrounding shell of atmosphere. It was a mixed mass of gases,\r\nchiefly oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon-dioxide (popularly known\r\nas \"carbonic acid gas\"). When the water-vapour settled as ocean on the\r\ncrust, the atmosphere remained a very dense mixture of oxygen, nitrogen,\r\nand carbon-dioxide--to neglect the minor gases. This heavy proportion of\r\ncarbon-dioxide would cause the atmosphere to act as a glass-house over\r\nthe surface of the earth, as it does still to some extent. Experiment\r\nhas shown that an atmosphere containing much vapour and carbon-dioxide\r\nlets the heat-rays pass through when they are accompanied by strong\r\nlight, but checks them when they are separated from the light. In other\r\nwords, the primitive atmosphere would allow the heat of the sun to\r\npenetrate it, and then, as the ground absorbed the light, would retain\r\na large proportion of the heat. Hence the semi-tropical nature of the\r\nprimitive earth, the moisture, the dense clouds and constant rains that\r\nare usually ascribed to it. This condition lasted until the rocks and\r\nthe forests of the Carboniferous age absorbed enormous quantities of\r\ncarbon-dioxide, cleared the atmosphere, and prepared an age of chill and\r\ndryness such as we find in the Permian.\r\n\r\nBut the planetesimal hypothesis has no room for this enormous percentage\r\nof carbon-dioxide in the primitive atmosphere. Hinc illoe lachrymoe: in\r\nplain English, hence the acute quarrel about primitive climate, and\r\nthe close scanning of the geological chronicle for indications that the\r\nearth was not moist and warm until the end of the Carboniferous period.\r\nOnce more I do not wish to enfeeble the general soundness of this\r\naccount of the evolution of life by relying on any controverted theory,\r\nand we shall find it possible to avoid taking sides.\r\n\r\nI have not referred to the climate of the earth in earlier ages, except\r\nto mention that there are traces of a local \"ice-age\" about the middle\r\nof the Archaean and the beginning of the Cambrian. As these are many\r\nmillions of years removed from each other and from the Carboniferous,\r\nit is possible that they represent earlier periods more or less\r\ncorresponding to the Permian. But the early chronicle is so compressed\r\nand so imperfectly studied as yet that it is premature to discuss the\r\npoint. It is, moreover, unnecessary because we know of no life on land\r\nin those remote periods, and it is only in connection with life on land\r\nthat we are interested in changes of climate here. In other words, as\r\nfar as the present study is concerned, we need only regard the climate\r\nof the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. As to this there is no\r\ndispute; nor, in fact, about the climate from the Cambrian to the\r\nPermian.\r\n\r\nAs the new school is most brilliantly represented by Professor\r\nChamberlin, [*] it will be enough to quote him. He says of the Cambrian\r\nthat, apart from the glacial indications in its early part, \"the\r\ntestimony of the fossils, wherever gathered, implies nearly uniform\r\nclimatic conditions... throughout all the earth wherever records of the\r\nCambrian period are preserved\" (ii, 273). Of the Ordovician he says:\r\n\"All that is known of the life of this era would seem to indicate that\r\nthe climate was much more uniform than now throughout the areas where\r\nthe strata of the period are known\" (ii, 342). In the Silurian we have\r\n\"much to suggest uniformity of climate\"--in fact, we have just the same\r\nevidence for it--and in the Devonian, when land-plants abound and afford\r\nbetter evidence, we find the same climatic equality of living things\r\nin the most different latitudes. Finally, \"most of the data at hand\r\nindicate that the climate of the Lower Carboniferous was essentially\r\nuniform, and on the whole both genial and moist\" (ii, 518). The \"data,\"\r\nwe may recall, are in this case enormously abundant, and indicate the\r\nclimate of the earth from the Arctic regions to the Antarctic. Another\r\nrecent and critical geologist, Professor Walther (\"Geschichte der\r\nErde und des Lebens,\" 1908), admits that the coal-vegetation shows\r\na uniformly warm climate from Spitzbergen to Africa. Mr. Drew (\"The\r\nRomance of Modern Geology,\" 1909) says that \"nearly all over the globe\r\nthe climate was the same--hot, close, moist, muggy\" (p. 219).\r\n\r\n     * An apology is due here in some measure. The work which I\r\n     quote as of Professor Chamberlin (\"Geology,\" 1903) is really\r\n     by two authors, Professors Chamberlin and Salisbury. I\r\n     merely quote Professor Chamberlin for shortness, and because\r\n     the particular ideas I refer to are expounded by him in\r\n     separate papers. The work is the finest manual in modern\r\n     geological literature. I have used it much, in conjunction\r\n     with the latest editions of Geikie, Le Conte, and Lupparent,\r\n     and such recent manuals as Walther, De Launay, Suess, etc.,\r\n     and the geological magazines.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe exception which Professor Chamberlin has in mind when he says \"most\r\nof the data\" is that we find deposits of salt and gypsum in the Silurian\r\nand Lower Carboniferous, and these seem to point to the evaporation\r\nof lakes in a dry climate. He admits that these indicate, at the most,\r\nlocal areas or periods of dryness in an overwhelmingly moist and warm\r\nearth. It is thus not disputed that the climate of the earth was, during\r\na period of at least fifteen million years (from the Cambrian to the\r\nCarboniferous), singularly uniform, genial, and moist. During that vast\r\nperiod there is no evidence whatever that the earth was divided into\r\nclimatic zones, or that the year was divided into seasons. To such an\r\nearth was the prolific life of the Coal-forest adapted.\r\n\r\nIt is, further, not questioned that the temperature of the earth fell in\r\nthe latter part of the Carboniferous age, and that the cold reached\r\nits climax in the Permian. As we turn over the pages of the geological\r\nchronicle, an extraordinary change comes over the vegetation of the\r\nearth. The great Lepidodendra gradually disappear before the close of\r\nthe Permian period; the Sigillariae dwindle into a meagre and expiring\r\nrace; the giant Horsetails (Calamites) shrink, and betray the adverse\r\nconditions in their thin, impoverished leaves. New, stunted, hardy\r\ntrees make their appearance: the Walchia, a tree something like the low\r\nAraucarian conifers in the texture of its wood, and the Voltzia, the\r\nreputed ancestor of the cypresses. Their narrow, stunted leaves suggest\r\nto the imagination the struggle of a handful of pines on a bleak\r\nhill-side. The rich fern-population is laid waste. The seed-ferns\r\ndie out, and a new and hardy type of fern, with compact leaves, the\r\nGlossopteris, spreads victoriously over the globe; from Australia it\r\ntravels northward to Russia, which it reaches in the early Permian, and\r\nwestward, across the southern continent, to South America. A profoundly\r\ndestructive influence has fallen on the earth, and converted its rich\r\ngreen forests, in which the mighty Club-mosses had reared their crowns\r\nabove a sea of waving ferns, into severe and poverty-stricken deserts.\r\n\r\nNo botanist hesitates to say that it is the coming of a cold, dry\r\nclimate that has thus changed the face of the earth. The geologist finds\r\nmore direct evidence. In the Werribee Gorge in Victoria I have seen the\r\nmarks which Australian geologists have discovered of the ice-age which\r\nput an end to their Coal-forests. From Tasmania to Queensland they\r\nfind traces of the rivers and fields of ice which mark the close of the\r\nCarboniferous and beginning of the Permian on the southern continent.\r\nIn South Africa similar indications are found from the Cape to the\r\nTransvaal. Stranger still, the geologists of India have discovered\r\nextensive areas of glaciation, belonging to this period, running down\r\ninto the actual tropics. And the strangest feature of all is that the\r\nglaciers of India and Australia flowed, not from the temperate zones\r\ntoward the tropics, but in the opposite direction. Two great zones of\r\nice-covered land lay north and south of the equator. The total area was\r\nprobably greater than the enormous area covered with ice in Europe and\r\nAmerica during the familiar ice-age of the latest geological period.\r\n\r\nThus the central idea of this chapter, the destructive inroad of a\r\ncolder climate upon the genial Carboniferous world, is an accepted fact.\r\nCritical geologists may suggest that the temperature of the Coal-forest\r\nhas been exaggerated, and the temperature of the Permian put too low.\r\nWe are not concerned with the dispute. Whatever the exact change of\r\ntemperature was, in degrees of the thermometer, it was admittedly\r\nsufficient to transform the face of the earth, and bring a mantle of ice\r\nover millions of square miles of our tropical and subtropical regions.\r\nIt remains for us to inquire into the causes of this transformation.\r\n\r\nIt at once occurs to us that these facts seem to confirm the prevalent\r\nidea, that the Coal-forests stripped the air of its carbon-dioxide until\r\nthe earth shivered in an atmosphere thinner than that of to-day.\r\nOn reflection, however, it will be seen that, if this were all that\r\nhappened, we might indeed expect to find enormous ice-fields extending\r\nfrom the poles--which we do not find--but not glaciation in the tropics.\r\nOthers may think of astronomical theories, and imagine a shrinking or\r\nclouding of the sun, or a change in the direction of the earth's axis.\r\nBut these astronomical theories are now little favoured, either\r\nby astronomers or geologists. Professor Lowell bluntly calls them\r\n\"astrocomic\" theories. Geologists think them superfluous. There is\r\nanother set of facts to be considered in connection with the Permian\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen several times, there are periods when, either owing to\r\nthe shrinking of the earth or the overloading of the sea-bottoms, or a\r\ncombination of the two, the land regains its lost territory and emerges\r\nfrom the ocean. Mountain chains rise; new continental surfaces are\r\nexposed to the sun and rain. One of the greatest of these upheavals of\r\nthe land occurs in the latter half of the Carboniferous and the Permian.\r\nIn the middle of the Carboniferous, when Europe is predominantly a flat,\r\nlow-lying land, largely submerged, a chain of mountains begins to rise\r\nacross its central part. From Brittany to the east of Saxony the great\r\nridge runs, and by the end of the Carboniferous it becomes a chain of\r\nlofty mountains (of which fragments remain in the Vosges, Black Forest,\r\nand Hartz mountains), dragging Central Europe high above the water, and\r\nthrowing the sea back upon Russia to the north and the Mediterranean\r\nregion to the south. Then the chain of the Ural Mountains begins to\r\nrise on the Russian frontier. By the beginning of the Permian Europe was\r\nhigher above the water than it had ever yet been; there was only a sea\r\nin Russia and a southern sea with narrow arms trailing to the northwest.\r\nThe continent of North America also had meantime emerged. The rise of\r\nthe Appalachia and Ouachita mountains completes the emergence of the\r\neastern continent, and throws the sea to the west. The Asiatic continent\r\nalso is greatly enlarged, and in the southern hemisphere there is a\r\nfurther rise, culminating in the Permian, of the continent (\"Gondwana\r\nLand\") which united South America, South Africa, the Antarctic land,\r\nAustralia and New Zealand, with an arm to India.\r\n\r\nIn a word, we have here a physical revolution in the face of the earth.\r\nThe changes were generally gradual, though they seem in some places to\r\nhave been rapid and abrupt (Chamberlin); but in summary they amounted\r\nto a vast revolution in the environment of animals and plants. The\r\nlow-lying, swampy, half-submerged continents reared themselves upward\r\nfrom the sea-level, shook the marshes and lagoons from their face, and\r\ndrained the vast areas that had fostered the growth of the Coal-forests.\r\nIt is calculated (Chamberlin) that the shallow seas which had covered\r\ntwenty or thirty million square miles of our continental surfaces in the\r\nearly Carboniferous were reduced to about five million square miles in\r\nthe Permian. Geologists believe, in fact, that the area of exposed land\r\nwas probably greater than it is now.\r\n\r\nThis lifting and draining of so much land would of itself have a\r\nprofound influence on life-conditions, and then we must take account of\r\nits indirect influence. The moisture of the earlier period was probably\r\ndue in the main to the large proportion of sea-surface and the absence\r\nof high land to condense it. In both respects there is profound\r\nalteration, and the atmosphere must have become very much drier. As this\r\nvapour had been one of the atmosphere's chief elements for retaining\r\nheat at the surface of the earth, the change will involve a great\r\nlowering of temperature. The slanting of the raised land would aid this,\r\nas, in speeding the rivers, it would promote the circulation of water.\r\nAnother effect would be to increase the circulation of the atmosphere.\r\nThe higher and colder lands would create currents of air that had not\r\nbeen formed before. Lastly, the ocean currents would be profoundly\r\nmodified; but the effect of this is obscure, and may be disregarded for\r\nthe moment.\r\n\r\nHere, therefore, we have a massive series of causes and effects, all\r\nconnected with the great emergence of the land, which throw a broad\r\nlight on the change in the face of the earth. We must add the lessening\r\nof the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Quite apart from theories of\r\nthe early atmosphere, this process must have had a great influence,\r\nand it is included by Professor Chamberlin among the causes of the\r\nworld-wide change. The rocks and forests of the Carboniferous period are\r\ncalculated to have absorbed two hundred times as much carbon as there is\r\nin the whole of our atmosphere to-day. Where the carbon came from we may\r\nleave open. The Planetesimalists look for its origin mainly in volcanic\r\neruptions, but, though there was much volcanic activity in the later\r\nCarboniferous and the Permian, there is little trace of it before the\r\nCoal-forests (after the Cambrian). However that may be, there was a\r\nconsiderable lessening of the carbon-dioxide of the atmosphere, and\r\nthis in turn had most important effects. First, the removal of so much\r\ncarbon-dioxide and vapour would be a very effective reason for a general\r\nfall in the temperature of the earth. The heat received from the sun\r\ncould now radiate more freely into space. Secondly, it has been shown by\r\nexperiment that a richness in carbon-dioxide favours Cryptogamous plants\r\n(though it is injurious to higher plants), and a reduction of it would\r\ntherefore be hurtful to the Cryptogams of the Coal-forest. One may\r\nalmost put it that, in their greed, they exhausted their store. Thirdly,\r\nit meant a great purification of the atmosphere, and thus a most\r\nimportant preparation of the earth for higher land animals and plants.\r\n\r\nThe reader will begin to think that we have sufficiently \"explained\"\r\nthe Permian revolution. Far from it. Some of its problems are as yet\r\ninsoluble. We have given no explanation at all why the ice-sheets, which\r\nwe would in a general way be prepared to expect, appear in India and\r\nAustralia, instead of farther north and south. Professor Chamberlin,\r\nin a profound study of the period (appendix to vol. ii, \"Geology\"),\r\nsuggests that the new land from New Zealand to Antarctica may have\r\ndiverted the currents (sea and air) up the Indian Ocean, and caused a\r\nlow atmospheric pressure, much precipitation of moisture, and perpetual\r\ncanopies of clouds to shield the ice from the sun. Since the outer polar\r\nregions themselves had been semi-tropical up to that time, it is very\r\ndifficult to see how this will account for a freezing temperature in\r\nsuch latitudes as Australia and India. There does not seem to have been\r\nany ice at the Poles up to that time, or for ages afterwards, so that\r\ncurrents from the polar regions would be very different from what\r\nthey are today. If, on the other hand, we may suppose that the rise of\r\n\"Gondwana Land\" (from Brazil to India) was attended by the formation\r\nof high mountains in those latitudes, we have the basis, at least, of\r\na more plausible explanation. Professor Chamberlin rejects this\r\nsupposition on the ground that the traces of ice-action are at or near\r\nthe sea-level, since we find with them beds containing marine fossils.\r\nBut this only shows, at the most, that the terminations of the glaciers\r\nreached the sea. We know nothing of the height of the land from which\r\nthey started.\r\n\r\nFor our main purpose, however, it is fortunately not necessary to clear\r\nup these mysteries. It is enough for us that the Carboniferous land\r\nrises high above the surface of the ocean over the earth generally.\r\nThe shallow seas are drained off its surface; its swamps and lagoons\r\ngenerally disappear; its waters run in falling rivers to the ocean. The\r\ndense, moist, warm atmosphere that had so long enveloped it is changed\r\ninto a thinner mantle of gas, through which, night by night, the\r\nsun-soaked ground can discharge its heat into space. Cold winds blow\r\nover it from the new mountains; probably vast regions of it are swept by\r\nicy blasts from the glaciated lands. As these conditions advance in the\r\nPermian period, the forests wither and shrink. Of the extraordinarily\r\nmixed vegetation which we found in the Coal-forests some few types are\r\nfitted to meet the severe conditions. The seed-bearing trees, the thin,\r\nneedle-leafed trees, the trees with stronger texture of the wood, are\r\nslowly singled out by the deepening cold. The golden age of Cryptogams\r\nis over. The age of the Cycad and the Conifers is opening. Survivors\r\nof the old order linger in the warmer valleys, as one may see to-day\r\ntree-ferns lingering in nooks of southern regions while an Antarctic\r\nwind is whistling on the hills above them; but over the broad earth\r\nthe luscious pasturage of the Coal-forest has changed into what is\r\ncomparatively a cold desert. We must not, of course, imagine too abrupt\r\na change. The earth had been by no means all swamp in the Carboniferous\r\nage. The new types were even then developing in the cooler and drier\r\nlocalities. But their hour has come, and there is great devastation\r\namong the lower plant population of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt follows at once that there would be, on land, an equal devastation\r\nand a similar selection in the animal world. The vegetarians suffered an\r\nappalling reduction of their food; the carnivores would dwindle in\r\nthe same proportion. Both types, again, would suffer from the enormous\r\nchanges in their physical surroundings. Vast stretches of marsh, with\r\nteeming populations, were drained, and turned into firm, arid plains or\r\nbleak hill-sides. The area of the Amphibia, for instance, was no less\r\nreduced than their food. The cold, in turn, would exercise a most\r\nformidable selection. Before the Permian period there was not on the\r\nwhole earth an animal with a warm-blooded (four-chambered) heart or a\r\nwarm coat of fur or feathers; nor was there a single animal that gave\r\nany further care to the eggs it discharged, and left to the natural\r\nwarmth of the earth to develop. The extermination of species in the egg\r\nalone must have been enormous.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to convey any just impression of the carnage which this\r\nPermian revolution wrought among the population of the earth. We can but\r\nestimate how many species of animals and plants were exterminated, and\r\nthe reader must dimly imagine the myriads of living things that are\r\ncomprised in each species. An earlier American geologist, Professor Le\r\nConte, said that not a single Carboniferous species crossed the line\r\nof the Permian revolution. This has proved to be an exaggeration, but\r\nProfessor Chamberlin seems to fall into an exaggeration on the other\r\nside when he says that 300 out of 10,000 species survived. There are\r\nonly about 300 species of animals and plants known in the whole of the\r\nPermian rocks (Geikie), and most of these are new. For instance, of the\r\nenormous plant-population of the Coal-forests, comprising many thousands\r\nof species, only fifty species survived unchanged in the Permian. We\r\nmay say that, as far as our knowledge goes, of every thirty species\r\nof animals and plants in the Carboniferous period, twenty-eight were\r\nblotted out of the calendar of life for ever; one survived by undergoing\r\nsuch modifications that it became a new species, and one was found\r\nfit to endure the new conditions for a time. We must leave it to the\r\nimagination to appreciate the total devastation of individuals entailed\r\nin this appalling application of what we call natural selection.\r\n\r\nBut what higher types of life issued from the womb of nature after so\r\nlong and painful a travail? The annihilation of the unfit is the seamy\r\nside, though the most real side, of natural selection. We ignore it, or\r\nextenuate it, and turn rather to consider the advances in organisation\r\nby which the survivors were enabled to outlive the great chill and\r\nimpoverishment.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, if the Permian period is an age of death, it is not an\r\nage of burials. The fossil population of its cemeteries is very scanty.\r\nNot only is the living population enormously reduced, but the areas that\r\nwere accustomed to entomb and preserve organisms--the lake and shore\r\ndeposits--are also greatly reduced. The frames of animals and plants now\r\nrot on the dry ground on which they live. Even in the seas, where life\r\nmust have been much reduced by the general disturbance of conditions,\r\nthe record is poor. Molluscs and Brachiopods and small fishes fill the\r\nlist, but are of little instructiveness for us, except that they show a\r\ngeneral advance of species. Among the Cephalopods, it is true, we find\r\na notable arrival. On the one hand, a single small straight-shelled\r\nCephalopod lingers for a time with the ancestral form; on the other\r\nhand, a new and formidable competitor appears among the coiled-shell\r\nCephalopods. It is the first appearance of the famous Ammonite, but\r\nwe may defer the description of it until we come to the great age of\r\nAmmonites.\r\n\r\nOf the insects and their fortunes in the great famine we have no direct\r\nknowledge; no insect remains have yet been found in Permian rocks. We\r\nshall, however, find them much advanced in the next period, and must\r\nconclude that the selection acted very effectively among their thousand\r\nCarboniferous species.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting outcome of the new conditions is the rise and\r\nspread of the reptiles. No other sign of the times indicates so clearly\r\nthe dawn of a new era as the appearance of these primitive, clumsy\r\nreptiles, which now begin to oust the Amphibia. The long reign of\r\naquatic life is over; the ensign of progress passes to the land animals.\r\nThe half-terrestrial, half-aquatic Amphibian deserts the water entirely\r\n(in one or more of its branches), and a new and fateful dynasty is\r\nfounded. Although many of the reptiles will return to the water, when\r\nthe land sinks once more, the type of the terrestrial quadruped is now\r\nfully evolved, and from its early reptilian form will emerge the lords\r\nof the air and the lords of the land, the birds and the mammals.\r\n\r\nTo the uninformed it may seem that no very great advance is made when\r\nthe reptile is evolved from the Amphibian. In reality the change implies\r\na profound modification of the frame and life of the vertebrate. Partly,\r\nwe may suppose, on account of the purification of the air, partly on\r\naccount of the decrease in water surface, the gills are now entirely\r\ndiscarded. The young reptile loses them during its embryonic life--as\r\nman and all the mammals and birds do to-day--and issues from the egg a\r\npurely lung-breathing creature. A richer blood now courses through the\r\narteries, nourishing the brain and nerves as well as the muscles. The\r\nsuperfluous tissue of the gill-structures is used in the improvement of\r\nthe ear and mouth-parts; a process that had begun in the Amphibian. The\r\nbody is raised up higher from the ground, on firmer limbs; the ribs and\r\nthe shoulder and pelvic bones--the saddles by which the weight of the\r\nbody is adjusted between the limbs and the backbone--are strengthened\r\nand improved. Finally, two important organs for the protection and\r\nnurture of the embryo (the amnion and the allantois) make their\r\nappearance for the first time in the reptile. In grade of organisation\r\nthe reptile is really nearer to the bird than it is to the salamander.\r\n\r\nYet these Permian reptiles are so generalised in character and so\r\nprimitive in structure that they point back unmistakably to an Amphibian\r\nancestry. The actual line of descent is obscure. When the reptiles first\r\nappear in the rocks, they are already divided into widely different\r\ngroups, and must have been evolved some time before. Probably they\r\nstarted from some group or groups of the Amphibia in the later\r\nCarboniferous, when, as we saw, the land began to rise considerably.\r\nWe have not yet recovered, and may never recover, the region where the\r\nearly forms lived, and therefore cannot trace the development in detail.\r\nThe fossil archives, we cannot repeat too often, are not a continuous,\r\nbut a fragmentary, record of the story of life. The task of the\r\nevolutionist may be compared to the work of tracing the footsteps of a\r\nstraying animal across the country. Here and there its traces will be\r\namply registered on patches of softer ground, but for the most part they\r\nwill be entirely lost on the firmer ground. So it is with the fossil\r\nrecord of life. Only in certain special conditions are the passing forms\r\nburied and preserved. In this case we can say only that the Permian\r\nreptiles fall into two great groups, and that one of these shows\r\naffinities to the small salamander-like Amphibia of the Coal-forest (the\r\nMicrosaurs), while the other has affinities to the Labyrinthodonts.\r\n\r\nA closer examination of these early reptiles may be postponed until we\r\ncome to speak of the \"age of reptiles.\" We shall see that it is probable\r\nthat an even higher type of animal, the mammal, was born in the throes\r\nof the Permian revolution. But enough has been said in vindication of\r\nthe phrase which stands at the head of this chapter; and to show how\r\nthe great Primary age of terrestrial life came to a close. With its new\r\ninhabitants the earth enters upon a fresh phase, and thousands of its\r\nearlier animals and plants are sealed in their primordial tombs, to\r\nawait the day when man will break the seals and put flesh once more on\r\nthe petrified bones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. THE MIDDLE AGES OF THE EARTH\r\n\r\nThe story of the earth from the beginning of the Cambrian period to the\r\npresent day was long ago divided by geologists into four great eras.\r\nThe periods we have already covered--the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian,\r\nDevonian, Carboniferous, and Permian--form the Primary or Palaeozoic\r\nEra, to which the earlier Archaean rocks were prefixed as a barren\r\nand less interesting introduction. The stretch of time on which we now\r\nenter, at the close of the Permian, is the Secondary or Mesozoic Era.\r\nIt will be closed by a fresh upheaval of the earth and disturbance of\r\nlife-conditions in the Chalk period, and followed by a Tertiary Era, in\r\nwhich the earth will approach its modern aspect. At its close there will\r\nbe another series of upheavals, culminating in a great Ice-age, and the\r\nremaining stretch of the earth's story, in which we live, will form the\r\nQuaternary Era.\r\n\r\nIn point of duration these four eras differ enormously from each other.\r\nIf the first be conceived as comprising sixteen million years--a very\r\nmoderate estimate--the second will be found to cover less than eight\r\nmillion years, the third less than three million years, and the fourth,\r\nthe Age of Man, much less than one million years; while the Archaean\r\nAge was probably as long as all these put together. But the division\r\nis rather based on certain gaps, or \"unconformities,\" in the geological\r\nrecord; and, although the breaches are now partially filled, we saw that\r\nthey correspond to certain profound and revolutionary disturbances in\r\nthe face of the earth. We retain them, therefore, as convenient and\r\nlogical divisions of the biological as well as the geological chronicle,\r\nand, instead of passing from one geological period to another, we may,\r\nfor the rest of the story, take these three eras as wholes, and devote\r\na few chapters to the chief advances made by living things in each era.\r\nThe Mesozoic Era will be a protracted reaction between two revolutions:\r\na period of low-lying land, great sea-invasions, and genial climate,\r\nbetween two upheavals of the earth. The Tertiary Era will represent a\r\nless sharply defined depression, with genial climate and luxuriant life,\r\nbetween two such upheavals.\r\n\r\nThe Mesozaic (\"middle life\") Era may very fitly be described as the\r\nMiddle Ages of life on the earth. It by no means occupies a central\r\nposition in the chronicle of life from the point of view of time or\r\nantiquity, just as the Middle Ages of Europe are by no means the centre\r\nof the chronicle of mankind, but its types of animals and plants are\r\nsingularly transitional between the extinct ancient and the actual\r\nmodern types. Life has been lifted to a higher level by the Permian\r\nrevolution. Then, for some millions of years, the sterner process of\r\nselection relaxes, the warm bosom of the earth swarms again with a\r\nteeming and varied population, and a rich material is provided for the\r\nnext great application of drastic selective agencies. To a poet it might\r\nseem that nature indulges each succeeding and imperfect type of living\r\nthing with a golden age before it is dismissed to make place for the\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\nThe Mesozoic opens in the middle of the great revolution described in\r\nthe last chapter. Its first section, the Triassic period, is at first a\r\nmere continuation of the Permian. A few hundred species of animals and\r\nhardy plants are scattered over a relatively bleak and inhospitable\r\nglobe. Then the land begins to sink once more. The seas spread in great\r\narms over the revelled continents, the plant world rejoices in the\r\nincreasing warmth and moisture, and the animals increase in number and\r\nvariety. We pass into the Jurassic period under conditions of great\r\ngeniality. Warm seas are found as far north and south as our present\r\npolar regions, and the low-lying fertile lands are covered again with\r\nrich, if less gigantic, forests, in which hordes of stupendous animals\r\nfind ample nourishment. The mammal and the bird are already on the\r\nstage, but their warm coats and warm blood offer no advantage in that\r\nperennial summer, and they await in obscurity the end of the golden age\r\nof the reptiles. At the end of the Jurassic the land begins to rise once\r\nmore. The warm, shallow seas drain off into the deep oceans, and the\r\nmoist, swampy lands are dried. The emergence continues throughout the\r\nCretaceous (Chalk) period. Chains of vast mountains rise slowly into the\r\nair in many parts of the earth, and a new and comparatively rapid\r\nchange in the vegetation--comparable to that at the close of the\r\nCarboniferous--announces the second great revolution. The Mesozoic\r\ncloses with the dismissal of the great reptiles and the plants on which\r\nthey fed, and the earth is prepared for its new monarchs, the flowering\r\nplants, the birds, and the mammals.\r\n\r\nHow far this repeated levelling of the land after its repeated upheavals\r\nis due to a real sinking of the crust we cannot as yet determine. The\r\ngeologist of our time is disposed to restrict these mysterious rises\r\nand falls of the crust as much as possible. A much more obvious and\r\nintelligible agency has to be considered. The vast upheaval of nearly\r\nall parts of the land during the Permian period would naturally lead to\r\na far more vigorous scouring of its surface by the rains and rivers. The\r\nhigher the land, the more effectively it would be worn down. The cooler\r\nsummits would condense the moisture, and the rains would sweep more\r\nenergetically down the slopes of the elevated continents. There would\r\nthus be a natural process of levelling as long as the land stood out\r\nhigh above the water-line, but it seems probable that there was also\r\na real sinking of the crust. Such subsidences have been known within\r\nhistoric times.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the Triassic--a period of at least two million years--the\r\nsea had reconquered a vast proportion of the territory wrested from it\r\nin the Permian revolution. Most of Europe, west of a line drawn from the\r\ntip of Norway to the Black Sea, was under water--generally open sea\r\nin the south and centre, and inland seas or lagoons in the west. The\r\ninvasion of the sea continued, and reached its climax, in the Jurassic\r\nperiod. The greater part of Europe was converted into an archipelago.\r\nA small continent stood out in the Baltic region. Large areas remained\r\nabove the sea-level in Austria, Germany, and France. Ireland, Wales,\r\nand much of Scotland were intact, and it is probable that a land bridge\r\nstill connected the west of Europe with the east of America. Europe\r\ngenerally was a large cluster of islands and ridges, of various sizes,\r\nin a semi-tropical sea. Southern Asia was similarly revelled, and it\r\nis probable that the seas stretched, with little interruption, from the\r\nwest of Europe to the Pacific. The southern continent had deep wedges\r\nof the sea driven into it. India, New Zealand, and Australia were\r\nsuccessively detached from it, and by the end of the Mesozoic it was\r\nmuch as we find it to-day. The Arctic continent (north of Europe) was\r\nflooded, and there was a great interior sea in the western part of the\r\nNorth American continent.\r\n\r\nThis summary account of the levelling process which went on during the\r\nTriassic and Jurassic will prepare us to expect a return of warm climate\r\nand luxurious life, and this the record abundantly evinces. The enormous\r\nexpansion of the sea--a great authority, Neumayr, believes that it was\r\nthe greatest extension of the sea that is known in geology--and lowering\r\nof the land would of itself tend to produce this condition, and it\r\nmay be that the very considerable volcanic activity, of which we find\r\nevidence in the Permian and Triassic, had discharged great volumes of\r\ncarbon-dioxide into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWhatever the causes were, the earth has returned to paradisiacal\r\nconditions. The vast ice-fields have gone, the scanty and scrubby\r\nvegetation is replaced by luscious forests of cycads, conifers, and\r\nferns, and warmth-loving animals penetrate to what are now the Arctic\r\nand Antarctic regions. Greenland and Spitzbergen are fragments of a\r\ncontinent that then bore a luxuriant growth of ferns and cycads, and\r\nhoused large reptiles that could not now live thousands of miles\r\nsouth of it. England, and a large part of Europe, was a tranquil blue\r\ncoral-ocean, the fringes of its islands girt with reefs such as we\r\nfind now only three thousand miles further south, with vast shoals\r\nof Ammonites, sometimes of gigantic size, preying upon its living\r\npopulation or evading its monstrous sharks; while the sunlit lands were\r\ncovered with graceful, palmlike cycads and early yews and pines and\r\ncypresses, and quaint forms of reptiles throve on the warm earth or in\r\nthe ample swamps, or rushed on outstretched wings through the purer air.\r\n\r\nIt was an evergreen world, a world, apparently, of perpetual summer.\r\nNo trace is found until the next period of an alternation of summer and\r\nwinter--no trees that shed their leaves annually, or show annual rings\r\nof growth in the wood--and there is little trace of zones of climate as\r\nyet. It is true that the sensitive Ammonites differ in the northern and\r\nthe southern latitudes, but, as Professor Chamberlin says, it is not\r\nclear that the difference points to a diversity of climate. We may\r\nconclude that the absence of corals higher than the north of England\r\nimplies a more temperate climate further north, but what Sir A. Geikie\r\ncalls (with slight exaggeration) \"the almost tropical aspect\" of\r\nGreenland warns us to be cautious. The climate of the mid-Jurassic was\r\nvery much warmer and more uniform than the climate of the earth to-day.\r\nIt was an age of great vital expansion. And into this luxuriant world we\r\nshall presently find a fresh period of elevation, disturbance, and cold\r\nbreaking with momentous evolutionary results. Meantime, we may take a\r\ncloser look at these interesting inhabitants of the Middle Ages of the\r\nearth, before they pass away or are driven, in shrunken regiments, into\r\nthe shelter of the narrowing tropics.\r\n\r\nThe principal change in the aspect of the earth, as the cold, arid\r\nplains and slopes of the Triassic slowly yield the moist and warm\r\now-lying lands of the Jurassic, to consists in the character of the\r\nvegetation. It is wholly intermediate in its forms between that of the\r\nprimitive forests and that of the modern world. The great Cryptogams of\r\nthe Carboniferous world--the giant Club-mosses and their kindred--have\r\nbeen slain by the long period of cold and drought. Smaller Horsetails\r\n(sometimes of a great size, but generally of the modern type) and\r\nClub-mosses remain, but are not a conspicuous feature in the landscape.\r\nOn the other hand, there is as yet--apart from the Conifers--no trace of\r\nthe familiar trees and flowers and grasses of the later world. The vast\r\nmajority of the plants are of the cycad type. These--now confined to\r\ntropical and subtropical regions--with the surviving ferns, the new\r\nConifers, and certain trees of the ginkgo type, form the characteristic\r\nMesozoic vegetation.\r\n\r\nA few words in the language of the modern botanist will show how this\r\nvegetation harmonises with the story of evolution. Plants are broadly\r\ndivided into the lower kingdom of the Cryptogams (spore-bearing) and the\r\nupper kingdom of the Phanerogams (seed-bearing). As we saw, the Primary\r\nEra was predominantly the age of Cryptogams; the later periods witness\r\nthe rise and supremacy of the Phanerogams. But these in turn are broadly\r\ndivided into a less advanced group, the Gymnosperms, and a more advanced\r\ngroup, the Angiosperms or flowering plants. And, just as the Primary Era\r\nis the age of Cryptogams, the Secondary is the age of Gymnosperms, and\r\nthe Tertiary (and present) is the age of Angiosperms. Of about 180,000\r\nspecies of plants in nature to-day more than 100,000 are Angiosperms;\r\nyet up to the end of the Jurassic not a single true Angiosperm is found\r\nin the geological record.\r\n\r\nThis is a broad manifestation of evolution, but it is not quite an\r\naccurate statement, and its inexactness still more strongly confirms the\r\ntheory of evolution. Though the Primary Era was predominantly the age of\r\nCryptogams, we saw that a very large number of seed-bearing plants, with\r\nvery mixed characters, appeared before its close. It thus prepares the\r\nway for the cycads and conifers and ginkgoes of the Mesozoic, which\r\nwe may conceive as evolved from one or other branch of the mixed\r\nCarboniferous vegetation. We next find that the Mesozoic is by no means\r\npurely an age of Gymnosperms. I do not mean merely that the Angiosperms\r\nappear in force before its close, and were probably evolved much\r\nearlier. The fact is that the Gymnosperms of the Mesozoic are often of\r\na curiously mixed character, and well illustrate the transition to the\r\nAngiosperms, though they may not be their actual ancestors. This will be\r\nclearer if we glance in succession at the various types of plant which\r\nadorned and enriched the Jurassic world.\r\n\r\nThe European or American landscape--indeed, the aspect of the earth\r\ngenerally, for there are no pronounced zones of climate--is still\r\nutterly different from any that we know to-day. No grass carpets the\r\nplains; none of the flowers or trees with which we are familiar, except\r\nconifers, are found in any region. Ferns grow in great abundance,\r\nand have now reached many of the forms with which we are acquainted.\r\nThickets of bracken spread over the plains; clumps of Royal ferns and\r\nHartstongues spring up in moister parts. The trees are conifers, cycads,\r\nand trees akin to the ginkgo, or Maidenhair Tree, of modern Japan.\r\nCypresses, yews, firs, and araucarias (the Monkey Puzzle group) grow\r\neverywhere, though the species are more primitive than those of today.\r\nThe broad, fan-like leaves and plum-like fruit of the ginkgoales, of\r\nwhich the temple-gardens of Japan have religiously preserved a solitary\r\ndescendant, are found in the most distant regions. But the most frequent\r\nand characteristic tree of the Jurassic landscape is the cycad.\r\n\r\nThe cycads--the botanist would say Cycadophyta or Cycadales, to mark\r\nthem off from the cycads of modern times--formed a third of the whole\r\nJurassic vegetation, while to-day they number only about a hundred\r\nspecies in 180,000, and are confined to warm latitudes. All over\r\nthe earth, from the Arctic to the Antarctic, their palm-like foliage\r\nshowered from the top of their generally short stems in the Jurassic.\r\nBut the most interesting point about them is that a very large branch of\r\nthem (the Bennettiteae) went far beyond the modern Gymnosperm in their\r\nflowers and fruit, and approached the Angiosperms. Their fructifications\r\n\"rivalled the largest flowers of the present day in structure and\r\nmodelling\" (Scott), and possibly already gave spots of sober colour to\r\nthe monotonous primitive landscape. On the other hand, they approached\r\nthe ferns so much more closely than modern cycads do that it is often\r\nimpossible to say whether Jurassic remains must be classed as ferns or\r\ncycads.\r\n\r\nWe have here, therefore, a most interesting evolutionary group. The\r\nbotanist finds even more difficulty than the zoologist in drawing up the\r\npedigrees of his plants, but the general features of the larger groups\r\nwhich he finds in succession in the chronicle of the earth point very\r\ndecisively to evolution. The seed-bearing ferns of the Coal-forest point\r\nupward to the later stage, and downward to a common origin with the\r\nordinary spore-bearing ferns. Some of them are \"altogether of a\r\ncycadean type\" (Scott) in respect of the seed. On the other hand, the\r\nBennettiteae of the Jurassic have the mixed characters of ferns, cycads,\r\nand flowering plants, and thus, in their turn, point downward to a lower\r\nancestry and upward to the next great stage in plant-development. It\r\nis not suggested that the seed-ferns we know evolved into the cycads we\r\nknow, and these in turn into our flowering plants. It is enough for the\r\nstudent of evolution to see in them so many stages in the evolution of\r\nplants up to the Angiosperm level. The gaps between the various groups\r\nare less rigid than scientific men used to think.\r\n\r\nTaller than the cycads, firmer in the structure of the wood, and\r\ndestined to survive in thousands of species when the cycads would be\r\nreduced to a hundred, were the pines and yews and other conifers of the\r\nJurassic landscape. We saw them first appearing, in the stunted Walchias\r\nand Voltzias, during the severe conditions of the Permian period. Like\r\nthe birds and mammals they await the coming of a fresh period of cold\r\nto give them a decided superiority over the cycads. Botanists look\r\nfor their ancestors in some form related to the Cordaites of the\r\nCoal-forest. The ginkgo trees seem to be even more closely related to\r\nthe Cordaites, and evolved from an early and generalised branch of that\r\ngroup. The Cordaites, we may recall, more or less united in one tree\r\nthe characters of the conifer (in their wood) and the cycad (in their\r\nfruit).\r\n\r\nSo much for the evolutionary aspect of the Jurassic vegetation in\r\nitself. Slender as the connecting links are, it points clearly enough\r\nto a selection of higher types during the Permian revolution from\r\nthe varied mass of the Carboniferous flora, and it offers in turn a\r\nsingularly varied and rich group from which a fresh selection may choose\r\nyet higher types. We turn now to consider the animal population which,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, fed upon it, and grew with its growth. To the\r\nreptiles, the birds, and the mammals, we must devote special chapters.\r\nHere we may briefly survey the less conspicuous animals of the Mesozoic\r\nEpoch.\r\n\r\nThe insects would be one of the chief classes to benefit by the renewed\r\nluxuriance of the vegetation. The Hymenopters (butterflies) have not yet\r\nappeared. They will, naturally, come with the flowers in the next\r\ngreat phase of organic life. But all the other orders of insects are\r\nrepresented, and many of our modern genera are fully evolved. The giant\r\ninsects of the Coal-forest, with their mixed patriarchal features, have\r\ngiven place to more definite types. Swarms of dragon-flies, may-flies,\r\ntermites (with wings), crickets, and cockroaches, may be gathered from\r\nthe preserved remains. The beetles (Coleopters) have come on the scene\r\nin the Triassic, and prospered exceedingly. In some strata three-fourths\r\nof the insects are beetles, and as we find that many of them\r\nare wood-eaters, we are not surprised. Flies (Dipters) and ants\r\n(Hymenopters) also are found, and, although it is useless to expect to\r\nfind the intermediate forms of such frail creatures, the record is of\r\nsome evolutionary interest. The ants are all winged. Apparently there\r\nis as yet none of the remarkable division of labour which we find in the\r\nants to-day, and we may trust that some later period of change may throw\r\nlight on its origin.\r\n\r\nJust as the growth of the forests--for the Mesozoic vegetation has\r\nformed immense coal-beds in many parts of the world, even in Yorkshire\r\nand Scotland--explains this great development of the insects, they would\r\nin their turn supply a rich diet to the smaller land animals and flying\r\nanimals of the time. We shall see this presently. Let us first glance at\r\nthe advances among the inhabitants of the seas.\r\n\r\nThe most important and stimulating event in the seas is the arrival of\r\nthe Ammonite. One branch of the early shell-fish, it will be remembered,\r\nretained the head of its naked ancestor, and lived at the open mouth of\r\nits shell, thus giving birth to the Cephalopods. The first form was\r\na long, straight, tapering shell, sometimes several feet long. In the\r\ncourse of time new forms with curved shells appeared, and began to\r\ndisplace the straight-shelled. Then Cephalopods with close-coiled\r\nshells, like the nautilus, came, and--such a shell being an obvious\r\nadvantage--displaced the curved shells. In the Permian, we saw, a new\r\nand more advanced type of the coiled-shell animal, the Ammonite, made\r\nits appearance, and in the Triassic and Jurassic it becomes the ogre or\r\ntyrant of the invertebrate world. Sometimes an inch or less in diameter,\r\nit often attained a width of three feet or more across the shell, at the\r\naperture of which would be a monstrous and voracious mouth.\r\n\r\nThe Ammonites are not merely interesting as extinct monsters of the\r\nearth's Middle Ages, and stimulating terrors of the deep to the animals\r\non which they fed. They have an especial interest for the evolutionist.\r\nThe successive chambers which the animal adds, as it grows, to the\r\nhabitation of its youth, leave the earlier chambers intact. By removing\r\nthem in succession in the adult form we find an illustration of the\r\nevolution of the elaborate shell of the Jurassic Ammonite. It is an\r\nadmirable testimony to the validity of the embryonic law we have often\r\nquoted--that the young animal is apt to reproduce the past stages of\r\nits ancestry--that the order of the building of the shell in the late\r\nAmmonite corresponds to the order we trace in its development in\r\nthe geological chronicle. About a thousand species of Ammonites were\r\ndeveloped in the Mesozoic, and none survived the Mesozoic. Like the\r\nTrilobites of the Primary Era, like the contemporary great reptiles\r\non land, the Ammonites were an abortive growth, enjoying their hour of\r\nsupremacy until sterner conditions bade them depart. The pretty\r\nnautilus is the only survivor to-day of the vast Mesozoic population of\r\ncoiled-shell Cephalopods.\r\n\r\nA rival to the Ammonite appeared in the Triassic seas, a formidable\r\nforerunner of the cuttle-fish type of Cephalopod. The animal now boldly\r\ndiscards the protecting and confining shell, or spreads over the outside\r\nof it, and becomes a \"shell-fish\" with the shell inside. The octopus of\r\nour own time has advanced still further, and become the most powerful of\r\nthe invertebrates. The Belemnite, as the Mesozoic cuttle-fish is called,\r\nattained so large a size that the internal bone, or pen (the part\r\ngenerally preserved), is sometimes two feet in length. The ink-bags of\r\nthe Belemnite also are sometimes preserved, and we see how it could balk\r\na pursuer by darkening the waters. It was a compensating advantage for\r\nthe loss of the shell.\r\n\r\nIn all the other classes of aquatic animals we find corresponding\r\nadvances. In the remaining Molluscs the higher or more effective types\r\nare displacing the older. It is interesting to note that the oyster is\r\nfully developed, and has a very large kindred, in the Mesozoic seas.\r\nAmong the Brachiopods the higher sloping-shoulder type displaces the\r\nsquare-shoulder shells. In the Crustacea the Trilobites and Eurypterids\r\nhave entirely disappeared; prawns and lobsters abound, and the earliest\r\ncrab makes its appearance in the English Jurassic rocks. This sudden\r\narrival of a short-tailed Crustacean surprises us less when we learn\r\nthat the crab has a long tail in its embryonic form, but the actual\r\nline of its descent is not clear. Among the Echinoderms we find that the\r\nCystids and Blastoids have gone, and the sea-lilies reach their climax\r\nin beauty and organisation, to dwindle and almost disappear in the last\r\npart of the Mesozoic. One Jurassic sea-lily was found to have 600,000\r\ndistinct ossicles in its petrified frame. The free-moving Echinoderms\r\nare now in the ascendant, the sea-urchins being especially abundant.\r\nThe Corals are, as we saw, extremely abundant, and a higher type (the\r\nHexacoralla) is superseding the earlier and lower (Tetracoralla).\r\n\r\nFinally, we find a continuous and conspicuous advance among the fishes.\r\nAt the close of the Triassic and during the Jurassic they seem to\r\nundergo profound and comparatively rapid changes. The reason will,\r\nperhaps, be apparent in the next chapter, when we describe the gigantic\r\nreptiles which feed on them in the lakes and shore-waters. A greater\r\nterror than the shark had appeared in their environment. The Ganoids and\r\nDipneusts dwindle, and give birth to their few modern representatives.\r\nThe sharks with crushing teeth diminish in number, and the sharp-toothed\r\nmodern shark attains the supremacy in its class, and evolves into forms\r\nfar more terrible than any that we know to-day. Skates and rays of a\r\nmore or less modern type, and ancestral gar-pikes and sturgeons,\r\nenter the arena. But the most interesting new departure is the first\r\nappearance, in the Jurassic, of bony-framed fishes (Teleosts). Their\r\nsuperiority in organisation soon makes itself felt, and they enter upon\r\nthe rapid evolution which will, by the next period, give them the first\r\nplace in the fish world.\r\n\r\nOver the whole Mesozoic world, therefore, we find advance and the\r\npromise of greater advance. The Permian stress has selected the fittest\r\ntypes to survive from the older order; the Jurassic luxuriance is\r\npermitting a fresh and varied expansion of life, in preparation for the\r\nnext great annihilation of the less fit and selection of the more fit.\r\nLife pauses before another leap. The Mesozoic earth--to apply to it the\r\nphrase which a geologist has given to its opening phase--welcomes the\r\ncoming and speeds the parting guest. In the depths of the ocean a new\r\nmovement is preparing, but we have yet to study the highest forms of\r\nMesozoic life before we come to the Cretaceous disturbances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. THE AGE OF REPTILES\r\n\r\nFrom one point of view the advance of life on the earth seems to proceed\r\nnot with the even flow of a river, but in the successive waves of an\r\noncoming tide. It is true that we have detected a continuous advance\r\nbehind all these rising and receding waves, yet their occurrence is a\r\nfact of some interest, and not a little speculation has been expended on\r\nit. When the great procession of life first emerges out of the darkness\r\nof Archaean times, it deploys into a spreading world of strange\r\nCrustaceans, and we have the Age of Trilobites. Later there is the\r\nAge of Fishes, then of Cryptogams and Amphibia, and then of Cycads and\r\nReptiles, and there will afterwards be an Age of Birds and Mammals, and\r\nfinally an Age of Man. But there is no ground for mystic speculation on\r\nthis circumstance of a group of organisms fording the earth for a few\r\nmillion years, and then perishing or dwindling into insignificance. We\r\nshall see that a very plain and substantial process put an end to the\r\nAge of the Cycads, Ammonites, and Reptiles, and we have seen how the\r\nearlier dynasties ended.\r\n\r\nThe phrase, however, the Age of Reptiles, is a fitting and true\r\ndescription of the greater part of the Mesozoic Era, which lies, like\r\na fertile valley, between the Permian and the Chalk upheavals. From the\r\nbleak heights of the Permian period, or--more probably--from its more\r\nsheltered regions, in which they have lingered with the ferns and\r\ncycads, the reptiles spread out over the earth, as the summer of the\r\nTriassic period advances. In the full warmth and luxuriance of the\r\nJurassic they become the most singular and powerful army that ever trod\r\nthe earth. They include small lizard-like creatures and monsters more\r\nthan a hundred feet in length. They swim like whales in the shallow\r\nseas; they shrink into the shell of the giant turtle; they rear\r\nthemselves on towering hind limbs, like colossal kangaroos; they even\r\nrise into the air, and fill it with the dragons of the fairy tale. They\r\nspread over the whole earth from Australia to the Arctic circle. Then\r\nthe earth seems to grow impatient of their dominance, and they shrink\r\ntowards the south, and struggle in a diminished territory. The colossal\r\nmonsters and the formidable dragons go the way of all primitive life,\r\nand a ragged regiment of crocodiles, turtles, and serpents in the\r\ntropics, with a swarm of smaller creatures in the fringes of the warm\r\nzone, is all that remains, by the Tertiary Era, of the world-conquering\r\narmy of the Mesozoic reptiles.\r\n\r\nThey had appeared, as we said, in the Permian period. Probably they\r\nhad been developed during the later Carboniferous, since we find\r\nthem already branched into three orders, with many sub-orders, in the\r\nPermian. The stimulating and selecting disturbances which culminated in\r\nthe Permian revolution had begun in the Carboniferous. Their origin is\r\nnot clear, as the intermediate forms between them and the amphibia are\r\nnot found. This is not surprising, if we may suppose that some of the\r\namphibia had, in the growing struggle, pushed inland, or that, as the\r\nland rose and the waters were drained in certain regions, they had\r\ngradually adopted a purely terrestrial life, as some of the frogs have\r\nsince done. In the absence of water their frames would not be preserved\r\nand fossilised. We can, therefore, understand the gap in the record\r\nbetween the amphibia and the reptiles. From their structure we gather\r\nthat they sprang from at least two different branches of the amphibia.\r\nTheir remains fall into two great groups, which are known as the Diapsid\r\nand the Synapsid reptiles. The former seem to be more closely related to\r\nthe Microsauria, or small salamander-like amphibia of the Coal-forest;\r\nthe latter are nearer to the Labyrinthodonts. It is not suggested that\r\nthese were their actual ancestors, but that they came from the same\r\nearly amphibian root.\r\n\r\nWe find both these groups, in patriarchal forms, in Europe, North\r\nAmerica, and South Africa during the Permian period. They are usually\r\nmoderate in size, but in places they seem to have found good conditions\r\nand prospered. A few years ago a Permian bed in Russia yielded a most\r\ninteresting series of remains of Synapsid reptiles. Some of them were\r\nlarge vegetarian animals, more than twelve feet in length; others were\r\ncarnivores with very powerful heads and teeth as formidable as those\r\nof the tiger. Another branch of the same order lived on the southern\r\ncontinent, Gondwana Land, and has left numerous remains in South Africa.\r\nWe shall see that they are connected by many authorities with the origin\r\nof the mammals. [*] The other branch, the Diapsids, are represented\r\nto-day by the curiously primitive lizard of New Zealand, the tuatara\r\n(Sphenodon, or Hatteria), of which I have seen specimens, nearly two\r\nfeet in length, that one did not care to approach too closely. The\r\nDiapsids are chiefly interesting, however, as the reputed ancestors of\r\nthe colossal reptiles of the Jurassic age and the birds.\r\n\r\n     * These Synapsid reptiles are more commonly known as\r\n     Pareiasauria or Theromorpha.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purified air of the Permian world favoured the reptiles' being\r\nlung-breathers, but the cold would check their expansion for a time.\r\nThe reptile, it is important to remember' usually leaves its eggs to\r\nbe hatched by the natural warmth of the ground. But as the cold of the\r\nPermian yielded to a genial climate and rich vegetation in the course of\r\nthe Triassic, the reptiles entered upon their memorable development. The\r\namphibia were now definitely ousted from their position of dominance.\r\nThe increase of the waters had at first favoured them, and we find more\r\nthan twenty genera, and some very large individuals, of the amphibia\r\nin the Triassic. One of them, the Mastodonsaurus, had a head three feet\r\nlong and two feet wide. But the spread of the reptiles checked them, and\r\nthey shrank rapidly into the poor and defenceless tribe which we find\r\nthem in nature to-day.\r\n\r\nTo follow the prolific expansion of the reptiles in the semi-tropical\r\nconditions of the Jurassic age is a task that even the highest\r\nauthorities approach with great diffidence. Science is not yet wholly\r\nagreed in the classification of the vast numbers of remains which the\r\nMesozoic rocks have yielded, and the affinities of the various groups\r\nare very uncertain. We cannot be content, however, merely to throw on\r\nthe screen, as it were, a few of the more quaint and monstrous types out\r\nof the teeming Mesozoic population, and describe their proportions and\r\npeculiarities. They fall into natural and intelligible groups or orders,\r\nand their features are closely related to the differing regions of\r\nthe Jurassic world. While, therefore, we must abstain from drawing\r\nup settled genealogical trees, we may, as we review in succession the\r\nmonsters of the land, the waters, and the air, glance at the most recent\r\nand substantial conjectures of scientific men as to their origin and\r\nconnections.\r\n\r\nThe Deinosaurs (or \"terrible reptiles\"), the monarchs of the land and\r\nthe swamps, are the central and outstanding family of the Mesozoic\r\nreptiles. As the name implies, this group includes most of the colossal\r\nanimals, such as the Diplodocus, which the illustrated magazine has made\r\nfamiliar to most people. Fortunately the assiduous research of American\r\ngeologists and their great skill and patience in restoring the dead\r\nforms enable us to form a very fair picture of this family of medieval\r\ngiants and its remarkable ramifications. [*]\r\n\r\n     * See, besides the usual authorities, a valuable paper by\r\n     Dr. R. S. Lull, \"Dinosaurian Distribution\" (1910).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Diapsid reptiles of the Permian had evolved a group with horny,\r\nparrot-like beaks, the Rhyncocephalia (or \"beak-headed\" reptiles), of\r\nwhich the tuatara of New Zealand is a lingering representative. New\r\nZealand seems to have been cut off from the southern continent at the\r\nclose of the Permian or beginning of the Triassic, and so preserved\r\nfor us that very interesting relic of Permian life. From some primitive\r\nlevel of this group, it is generally believed, the great Deinosaurs\r\narose. Two different orders seem to have arisen independently, or\r\ndiverged rapidly from each other, in different parts of the world. One\r\ngroup seems to have evolved on the \"lost Atlantis,\" the land between\r\nWestern Europe and America, whence they spread westward to America,\r\neastward over Europe, and southward to the continent which still united\r\nAfrica and Australia. We find their remains in all these regions.\r\nAnother stock is believed to have arisen in America.\r\n\r\nBoth these groups seem to have been more or less biped, rearing\r\nthemselves on large and powerful hind limbs, and (in some cases, at\r\nleast) probably using their small front limbs to hold or grasp their\r\nfood. The first group was carnivorous, the second herbivorous; and, as\r\nthe reptiles of the first group had four or five toes on each foot,\r\nthey are known as the Theropods (or \"beast-footed\" ), while those of\r\nthe second order, which had three toes, are called the Ornithopods (or\r\n\"bird-footed\"). Each of them then gave birth to an order of quadrupeds.\r\nIn the spreading waters and rich swamps of the later Triassic some of\r\nthe Theropods were attracted to return to an amphibious life, and became\r\nthe vast, sprawling, ponderous Sauropods, the giants in a world of\r\ngiants. On the other hand, a branch of the vegetarian Ornithopods\r\ndeveloped heavy armour, for defence against the carnivores, and\r\nbecame, under the burden of its weight, the quadrupedal and monstrous\r\nStegosauria and Ceratopsia. Taking this instructive general view of the\r\nspread of the Deinosaurs as the best interpretation of the material we\r\nhave, we may now glance at each of the orders in succession.\r\n\r\nThe Theropods varied considerably in size and agility. The Compsognathus\r\nwas a small, active, rabbit-like creature, standing about two feet high\r\non its hind limbs, while the Megalosaurs stretched to a length of\r\nthirty feet, and had huge jaws armed with rows of formidable teeth. The\r\nCeratosaur, a seventeen-foot-long reptile, had hollow bones, and we find\r\nthis combination of lightness and strength in several members of the\r\ngroup. In many respects the group points more or less significantly\r\ntoward the birds. The brain is relatively large, the neck long, and\r\nthe fore limbs might be used for grasping, but had apparently ceased to\r\nserve as legs. Many of the Theropods were evidently leaping reptiles,\r\nlike colossal kangaroos, twenty or more feet in length when they were\r\nerect. It is the general belief that the bird began its career as a\r\nleaping reptile, and the feathers, or expanded scales, on the front\r\nlimbs helped at first to increase the leap. Some recent authorities\r\nhold, however, that the ancestor of the bird was an arboreal reptile.\r\n\r\nTo the order of the Sauropods belong most of the monsters whose\r\ndiscovery has attracted general attention in recent years. Feeding\r\non vegetal matter in the luscious swamps, and having their vast bulk\r\nlightened by their aquatic life, they soon attained the most formidable\r\nproportions. The admirer of the enormous skeleton of Diplodocus (which\r\nran to eighty feet) in the British Museum must wonder how even such\r\nmassive limbs could sustain the mountain of flesh that must have\r\ncovered those bones. It probably did not walk so firmly as the skeleton\r\nsuggests, but sprawled in the swamps or swam like a hippopotamus. But\r\nthe Diplodocus is neither the largest nor heaviest of its family. The\r\nBrontosaur, though only sixty feet long, probably weighed twenty tons.\r\nWe have its footprints in the rocks to-day, each impression measuring\r\nabout a square yard. Generally, it is the huge thigh-bones of these\r\nmonsters that have survived, and give us an idea of their size. The\r\nlargest living elephant has a femur scarcely four feet long, but the\r\nfemur of the Atlantosaur measures more than seventy inches, and the\r\nfemur of the Brachiosaur more than eighty. Many of these Deinosaurs must\r\nhave measured more than a hundred feet from the tip of the snout to the\r\nend of the tail, and stood about thirty feet high from the ground. The\r\nEuropean Sauropods did not, apparently, reach the size of their American\r\ncousins--so early did the inferiority of Europe begin--but our Ceteosaur\r\nseems to have been about fifty feet long and ten feet in height.\r\nIts thigh-bone was sixty-four inches long and twenty-seven inches in\r\ncircumference at the shaft. And in this order of reptiles, it must be\r\nremembered, the bones are solid.\r\n\r\nTo complete the picture of the Sauropods, we must add that the whole\r\nclass is characterised by the extraordinary smallness of the brain.\r\nThe twenty-ton Brontosaur had a brain no larger than that of a new-born\r\nhuman infant. Quite commonly the brain of one of these enormous animals\r\nis no larger than a man's fist. It is true that, as far as the muscular\r\nand sexual labour was concerned, the brain was supplemented by a great\r\nenlargement of the spinal cord in the sacral region (at the top of the\r\nthighs). This inferior \"brain\" was from ten to twenty times as large as\r\nthe brain in the skull. It would, however, be fully occupied with the\r\nmovement of the monstrous limbs and tail, and the sex-life, and does\r\nnot add in the least to the \"mental\" power of the Sauropods. They were\r\nstupid, sluggish, unwieldy creatures, swollen parasites upon a luxuriant\r\nvegetation, and we shall easily understand their disappearance at the\r\nend of the Mesozoic Era, when the age of brawn will yield to an age of\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\nThe next order of the Deinosaurs is that of the biped vegetarians, the\r\nOrnithopods, which gradually became heavily armoured and quadrupedal.\r\nThe familiar Iguanodon is the chief representative of this order in\r\nEurope. Walking on its three-toed hind limbs, its head would be\r\nfourteen or fifteen feet from the ground. The front part of its jaws was\r\ntoothless and covered with horn. It had, in fact, a kind of beak, and it\r\nalso approached the primitive bird in the structure of its pelvis and in\r\nhaving five toes on its small front limbs. Some of the Ornithopods, such\r\nas the Laosaur, were small (three or four feet in height) and\r\nactive, but many of the American specimens attained a great size. The\r\nCamptosaur, which was closely related to the Iguanodon in structure, was\r\nthirty feet from the snout to the end of the tail, and the head\r\nprobably stood eighteen feet from the ground. One of the last great\r\nrepresentatives of the group in America, the Trachodon, about thirty\r\nfeet in length, had a most extraordinary head. It was about three and\r\na half feet in length, and had no less than 2000 teeth lining the mouth\r\ncavity. It is conjectured that it fed on vegetation containing a large\r\nproportion of silica.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the Jurassic, as we saw, a branch of these biped,\r\nbird-footed vegetarians developed heavy armour, and returned to the\r\nquadrupedal habit. We find them both in Europe and America, and must\r\nsuppose that the highway across the North Atlantic still existed.\r\n\r\nThe Stegosaur is one of the most singular and most familiar\r\nrepresentatives of the group in the Jurassic. It ran to a length of\r\nthirty feet, and had a row of bony plates, from two to three feet in\r\nheight, standing up vertically along the ridge of its back, while its\r\ntail was armed with formidable spikes. The Scleidosaur, an earlier\r\nand smaller (twelve-foot) specimen, also had spines and bony plates to\r\nprotect it. The Polacanthus and Ankylosaur developed a most effective\r\narmour-plating over the rear. As we regard their powerful armour, we\r\nseem to see the fierce-toothed Theropods springing from the rear upon\r\nthe poor-mouthed vegetarians. The carnivores selected the vegetarians,\r\nand fitted them to survive. Before the end of the Mesozoic, in fact, the\r\nOrnithopods became aggressive as well as armoured. The Triceratops had\r\nnot only an enormous skull with a great ridged collar round the neck,\r\nbut a sharp beak, a stout horn on the nose, and two large and sharp\r\nhorns on the top of the head. We will see something later of the\r\ndevelopment of horns. The skulls of members of the Ceratops family\r\nsometimes measured eight feet from the snout to the ridge of the collar.\r\nThey were, however, sluggish and stupid monsters, with smaller brains\r\neven than the Sauropods.\r\n\r\nSuch, in broad outline, was the singular and powerful family of the\r\nMesozoic Deinosaurs. Further geological research in all parts of the\r\nworld will, no doubt, increase our knowledge of them, until we can fully\r\nunderstand them as a great family throwing out special branches to meet\r\nthe different conditions of the crowded Jurassic age. Even now they\r\nafford a most interesting page in the story of evolution, and their\r\ntotal disappearance from the face of the earth in the next geological\r\nperiod will not be unintelligible. We turn from them to the remaining\r\norders of the Jurassic reptiles.\r\n\r\nIn the popular mind, perhaps, the Ichthyosaur and Plesiosaur are the\r\ntypical representatives of that extinct race. The two animals, however,\r\nbelong to very different branches of the reptile world, and are by no\r\nmeans the most formidable of the Mesozoic reptiles. Many orders of the\r\nland reptiles sent a branch into the waters in an age which, we saw, was\r\npredominantly one of water-surface. The Ichthyosauria (\"fish-reptiles\")\r\nand Thalattosauria (\"sea-reptiles\") invaded the waters at their first\r\nexpansion in the later Triassic. The latter groups soon became extinct,\r\nbut the former continued for some millions of years, and became\r\nremarkably adapted to marine life, like the whale at a later period.\r\n\r\nThe Ichthyosaur of the Jurassic is a remarkably fish-like animal. Its\r\nlong tapering frame--sometimes forty feet in length, but generally less\r\nthan half that length--ends in a dip of the vertebral column and an\r\nexpansion of the flesh into a strong tail-fin. The terminal bones of the\r\nlimbs depart more and more from the quadruped type, until at last they\r\nare merely rows of circular bony plates embedded in the broad paddle\r\ninto which the limb has been converted. The head is drawn out, sometimes\r\nto a length of five feet, and the long narrow jaws are set with two\r\nformidable rows of teeth; one specimen has about two hundred teeth. In\r\nsome genera the teeth degenerate in the course of time, but this\r\nmerely indicates a change of diet. One fossilised Ichthyosaur of the\r\nweaker-toothed variety has been found with the remains of two hundred\r\nBelemnites in its stomach. It is a flash of light on the fierce struggle\r\nand carnage which some recent writers have vainly striven to attenuate.\r\nThe eyes, again, which may in the larger animals be fifteen inches in\r\ndiameter, are protected by a circle of radiating bony plates. In fine,\r\nthe discovery of young developed skeletons inside the adult frames has\r\ntaught us that the Ichthgosaur had become viviparous, like the mammal.\r\nCutting its last connection with the land, on which it originated it\r\nceased to lay eggs, and developed the young within its body.\r\n\r\nThe Ichthyosaur came of the reptile group which we have called the\r\nDiapsids. The Plesiosaur seems to belong to the Synapsid branch. In the\r\nearlier Mesozoic we find partially aquatic representatives of the line,\r\nlike the Nothosaur, and in the later Plesiosaur the adaptation to a\r\nmarine life is complete. The skin has lost its scales, and the front\r\nlimbs are developed into powerful paddles, sometimes six feet in length.\r\nThe neck is drawn out until, in some specimens, it is found to consist\r\nof seventy-six vertebrae: the longest neck in the animal world. It is\r\nnow doubted, however, if the neck was very flexible, and, as the jaws\r\nwere imperfectly joined, the common picture of the Plesiosaur darting\r\nits snake-like neck in all directions to seize its prey is probably\r\nwrong. It seems to have lived on small food, and been itself a rich diet\r\nto the larger carnivores. We find it in all the seas of the Mesozoic\r\nworld, varying in length from six to forty feet, but it is one of the\r\nsluggish and unwieldy forms that are destined to perish in the coming\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\nThe last, and perhaps the most interesting, of the doomed monsters\r\nof the Mesozoic was the Pterosaur, or \"flying reptile.\" It is not\r\nsurprising that in the fierce struggle which is reflected in the arms\r\nand armour of the great reptiles, a branch of the family escaped into\r\nthe upper region. We have seen that there were leaping reptiles with\r\nhollow bones, and although the intermediate forms are missing, there\r\nis little doubt that the Pterosaur developed from one or more of these\r\nleaping Deinosaurs. As it is at first small, when it appears in the\r\nearly Jurassic--it is disputed in the late Triassic--it probably came\r\nfrom a small and agile Deinosaur, hunted by the carnivores, which relied\r\non its leaping powers for escape. A flapperlike broadening of the fore\r\nlimbs would help to lengthen the leap, and we must suppose that this\r\nmembrane increased until the animal could sail through the air, like the\r\nflying-fish, and eventually sustain its weight in the air. The wing\r\nis, of course, not a feathery frame, as in the bird, but a special skin\r\nspreading between the fore limb and the side of the body. In the bat\r\nthis skin is supported by four elongated fingers of the hand, but in\r\nthe Pterosaur the fifth (or fourth) finger alone--which is enormously\r\nelongated and strengthened--forms its outer frame. It is as if, in\r\nflying experiments, a man were to have a web of silk stretching from his\r\narm and an extension of his little finger to the side of his body.\r\n\r\nFrom the small early specimens in the early Jurassic the flying reptiles\r\ngrow larger and larger until the time of their extinction in the\r\nstresses of the Chalk upheaval. Small Pterosaurs continue throughout the\r\nperiod, but from these bat-like creatures we rise until we come to such\r\ndragons as the American Pteranodon, with a stretch of twenty-two feet\r\nbetween its extended wings and jaws about four feet long. There were\r\nlong-tailed Pterosaurs (Ramphorhyncus), sometimes with a rudder-like\r\nexpansion of the end of the tail, and short-tailed Pterosaurs\r\n(Pterodactyl), with compact bodies and keeled breasts, like the bird. In\r\nthe earlier part of the period they all have the heavy jaws and numerous\r\nteeth of the reptile, with four or five well-developed fingers on the\r\nfront limbs. In the course of time they lose the teeth--an advantage\r\nin the distribution of the weight of the body while flying--and develop\r\nhorny beaks. In the gradual shaping of the breast-bone and head, also,\r\nthey illustrate the evolution of the bird-form.\r\n\r\nBut the birds were meantime developing from a quite different stock,\r\nand would replace the Pterosaurs at the first change in the environment.\r\nThere is ground for thinking that these flying reptiles were\r\nwarm-blooded like the birds. Their hollow bones seem to point to the\r\neffective breathing of a warm-blooded animal, and the great vitality\r\nthey would need in flying points toward the same conclusion. Their\r\nbrain, too, approached that of the bird, and was much superior to that\r\nof the other reptiles. But they had no warm coats to retain their heat,\r\nno clavicle to give strength to the wing machinery, and, especially in\r\nthe later period, they became very weak in the hind limbs (and therefore\r\nweak or slow in starting their flight). The coming selection will\r\ntherefore dismiss them from the scene, with the Deinosaurs and\r\nAmmonites, and retain the better organised bird as the lord of the air.\r\n\r\nThere remain one or two groups of the Mesozoic reptiles which are still\r\nrepresented in nature. The turtle-group (Chelonia) makes its appearance\r\nin the Triassic and thrives in the Jurassic. Its members are extinct and\r\nprimitive forms of the thick-shelled reptiles, but true turtles, both\r\nof marine and fresh water, abound before the close of the Mesozoic.\r\nThe sea-turtles attain an enormous size. Archelon, one of the primitive\r\ntypes, measured about twelve feet across the shell. Another was thirteen\r\nfeet long and fifteen feet from one outstretched flipper to the other.\r\nIn the Chalk period they form more than a third of the reptile remains\r\nin some regions. They are extremely interesting in that they show, to\r\nsome extent, the evolution of their characteristic shell. In some of the\r\nlarger specimens the ribs have not yet entirely coalesced.\r\n\r\nThe Crocodilians also appear in the later Triassic, abound in the\r\nJurassic, and give way before the later types, the true Crocodiles, in\r\nthe Cretaceous. They were marine animals with naked skin, a head and\r\nneck something like that of the Ichthyosaur, and paddles like those of\r\nthe Plesiosaur. Their back limbs, however, were not much changed after\r\ntheir adaptation to life in the sea, and it is concluded that they\r\nvisited the land to lay their eggs. The Teleosaur was a formidable\r\nnarrow-spouted reptile, somewhat resembling the crocodiles of the Ganges\r\nin the external form of the jaws. The modern crocodiles, which replaced\r\nthis ancient race of sea-crocodiles, have a great advantage over them\r\nin the fact that their nostrils open into the mouth in its lower depths.\r\nThey can therefore close their teeth on their prey under water and\r\nbreathe through the nose.\r\n\r\nSnakes are not found until the close of the Mesozoic, and do not figure\r\nin its characteristic reptile population. We will consider them later.\r\nBut there was a large group of reptiles in the later Mesozoic seas which\r\nmore or less correspond to the legendary idea of a sea-serpent. These\r\nDolichosaurs (\"long reptiles\") appear at the beginning of the Chalk\r\nperiod, and develop into a group, the Mososaurians, which must have\r\nadded considerably to the terrors of the shore-waters. Their slender\r\nscale-covered bodies were commonly twenty to thirty feet in length. The\r\nsupreme representative of the order, the Mososaur, of which about forty\r\nspecies are known, was sometimes seventy-five feet long. It had two\r\npairs of paddles--so that the name of sea-serpent is very imperfectly\r\napplicable--and four rows of formidable teeth on the roof of its mouth.\r\nLike the Deinosaurs and Pterosaurs, the order was doomed to be entirely\r\nextinguished after a brief supremacy in its environment.\r\n\r\nFrom this short and summary catalogue the reader will be able to form\r\nsome conception of the living inhabitants of the Mesozoic world. It is\r\nassuredly the Age of Reptiles. Worms, snails, and spiders were, we may\r\nassume, abundant enough, and a great variety of insects flitted from\r\ntree to tree or sheltered in the fern brakes. But the characteristic\r\nlife, in water and on land, was the vast and diversified family of\r\nthe reptiles. In the western and the eastern continent, and along the\r\nnarrowing bridge that still united them, in the northern hemisphere and\r\nthe southern, and along every ridge of land that connected them, these\r\nsluggish but formidable monsters filled the stage. Every conceivable\r\ndevice in the way of arms and armour, brute strength and means of\r\nescape, seemed to be adopted in their development, as if they were the\r\nfinal and indestructible outcome of the life-principle. And within a\r\nsingle geological period the overwhelming majority of them, especially\r\nthe larger and more formidable of them, were ruthlessly slain, leaving\r\nnot a single descendant on the earth. Let us see what types of animals\r\nwere thus preferred to them in the next great application of selective\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. THE BIRD AND THE MAMMAL\r\n\r\nIn one of his finest stories, Sur La Pierre Blanche, Anatole France\r\nhas imagined a group of Roman patricians discussing the future of their\r\nEmpire. The Christians, who are about to rise to power on their ruin,\r\nthey dismiss with amiable indifference as one of the little passing\r\neccentricities of the religious life of their time. They have not the\r\ndimmest prevision, even as the dream of a possibility, that in a century\r\nor two the Empire of Rome will lie in the dust, and the cross will tower\r\nabove all its cities from York to Jerusalem. If we might for a moment\r\nendow the animals of the Mesozoic world with AEsopian wisdom, we could\r\nimagine some such discussion taking place between a group of Deinosaur\r\npatricians. They would reflect with pride on the unshakable empire of\r\nthe reptiles, and perhaps glance with disdain at two types of animals\r\nwhich hid in the recesses or fled to the hills of the Jurassic world.\r\nAnd before another era of the earth's story opened, the reptile\r\nrace would be dethroned, and these hunted and despised and feeble\r\neccentricities of Mesozoic life would become the masters of the globe.\r\n\r\nThese two types of organisms were the bird and the mammal. Both existed\r\nin the Jurassic, and the mammals at least had many representatives\r\nin the Triassic. In other words, they existed, with all their higher\r\norganisation, during several million years without attaining power. The\r\nmammals remained, during at least 3,000,000 years, a small and obscure\r\ncaste, immensely overshadowed by the small-brained reptiles. The birds,\r\nwhile making more progress, apparently, than the mammals, were far\r\noutnumbered by the flying reptiles until the last part of the Mesozoic.\r\nThen there was another momentous turn of the wheel of fate, and they\r\nemerged from their obscurity to assume the lordship of the globe.\r\n\r\nIn earlier years, when some serious hesitation was felt by many to\r\naccept the new doctrine of evolution, a grave difficulty was found in\r\nthe circumstance that new types--not merely new species and new genera,\r\nbut new orders and even sub-classes--appeared in the geological record\r\nquite suddenly. Was it not a singular coincidence that in ALL cases the\r\nintermediate organisms between one type and another should have wholly\r\nescaped preservation? The difficulty was generally due to an imperfect\r\nacquaintance with the conditions of the problem. The fossil population\r\nof a period is only that fraction of its living population which\r\nhappened to be buried in a certain kind of deposit under water of a\r\ncertain depth. We shall read later of insects being preserved in resin\r\n(amber), and we have animals (and even bacteria) preserved in trees from\r\nthe Coal-forests. Generally speaking, however, the earth has buried only\r\na very minute fraction of its land-population. Moreover, only a fraction\r\nof the earth's cemeteries have yet been opened. When we further reflect\r\nthat the new type of organism, when it first appears, is a small and\r\nlocal group, we see what the chances are of our finding specimens of\r\nit in a few scattered pages of a very fragmentary record of the earth's\r\nlife. We shall see that we have discovered only about ten skeletons\r\nor fragments of skeletons of the men who lived on the earth before the\r\nNeolithic period; a stretch of some hundreds of thousands of years,\r\nrecorded in the upper strata of the earth.\r\n\r\nWhatever serious difficulty there ever was in this scantiness of\r\nintermediate types is amply met by the fact that every fresh decade of\r\nsearch in the geological tombs brings some to light. We have seen many\r\ninstances of this--the seed-bearing ferns and flower-bearing cycads, for\r\nexample, found in the last decade--and will see others. But one of the\r\nmost remarkable cases of the kind now claims our attention. The bird was\r\nprobably evolved in the late Triassic or early Jurassic. It appears in\r\nabundance, divided into several genera, in the Chalk period. Luckily,\r\ntwo bird-skeletons have been found in the intermediate period, the\r\nJurassic, and they are of the intermediate type, between the reptile\r\nand the bird, which the theory of evolution would suggest. But for\r\nthe fortunate accident of these two birds being embedded in an ancient\r\nBavarian mud-layer, which happened to be opened, for commercial\r\npurposes, in the second half of the nineteenth century, critics of\r\nevolution--if there still were any in the world of science--might be\r\nrepeating to-day that the transition from the reptile to the bird was\r\nunthinkable in theory and unproven in fact.\r\n\r\nThe features of the Archaeopteryx (\"primitive bird\") have been described\r\nso often, and such excellent pictorial restorations of its appearance\r\nmay now be seen, that we may deal with it briefly. We have in it a most\r\ninstructive combination of the characters of the bird and the reptile.\r\nThe feathers alone, the imprint of which is excellently preserved in\r\nthe fine limestone, would indicate its bird nature, but other anatomical\r\ndistinctions are clearly seen in it. \"There is,\" says Dr. Woodward, \"a\r\ntypical bird's 'merrythought' between the wings, and the hind leg\r\nis exactly that of a perching bird.\" In other words, it has the\r\nshoulder-girdle and four-toed foot, as well as the feathers, of a bird.\r\nOn the other hand, it has a long tail (instead of a terminal tuft of\r\nfeathers as in the bird) consisting of twenty-one vertebrae, with\r\nthe feathers springing in pairs from either side; it has biconcave\r\nvertebrae, like the fishes, amphibia, and reptiles; it has teeth in its\r\njaws; and it has three complete fingers, free and clawed, on its front\r\nlimbs.\r\n\r\nAs in the living Peripatus, therefore, we have here a very valuable\r\nconnecting link between two very different types of organisms. It is\r\nclear that one of the smaller reptiles--the Archaeopteryx is between a\r\npigeon and a crow in size--of the Triassic period was the ancestor of\r\nthe birds. Its most conspicuous distinction was that it developed a\r\ncoat of feathers. A more important difference between the bird and the\r\nreptile is that the heart of the bird is completely divided into four\r\nchambers, but, as we saw, this probably occurred also in the other\r\nflying reptiles. It may be said to be almost a condition of the greater\r\nenergy of a flying animal. When the heart has four complete chambers,\r\nthe carbonised blood from the tissues of the body can be conveyed direct\r\nto the lungs for purification, and the aerated blood taken direct to the\r\ntissues, without any mingling of the two. In the mud-fish and amphibian,\r\nwe saw, the heart has two chambers (auricles) above, but one (ventricle)\r\nbelow, in which the pure and impure blood mingle. In the reptiles a\r\npartition begins to form in the lower chamber. In the turtle it is\r\nso nearly complete that the venous and the arterial blood are fairly\r\nseparated; in the crocodile it is quite complete, though the arteries\r\nare imperfectly arranged. Thus the four-chambered heart of the bird and\r\nmammal is not a sudden and inexplicable development. Its advantage is\r\nenormous in a cold climate. The purer supply of blood increases the\r\ncombustion in the tissues, and the animal maintains its temperature and\r\nvitality when the surrounding air falls in temperature. It ceases to be\r\n\"cold-blooded.\"\r\n\r\nBut the bird secures a further advantage, and here it outstrips the\r\nflying reptile. The naked skin of the Pterosaur would allow the heat to\r\nescape so freely when the atmosphere cooled that a great strain would be\r\nlaid on its vitality. A man lessens the demand on his vitality in cold\r\nregions by wearing clothing. The bird somehow obtained clothing, in\r\nthe shape of a coat of feathers, and had more vitality to spare for\r\nlife-purposes in a falling temperature. The reptile is strictly limited\r\nto one region, the bird can pass from region to region as food becomes\r\nscarce.\r\n\r\nThe question of the origin of the feathers can be discussed only from\r\nthe speculative point of view, as they are fully developed in the\r\nArchaeopteryx, and there is no approach toward them in any other living\r\nor fossil organism. But a long discussion of the problem has convinced\r\nscientific men that the feathers are evolved from the scales of the\r\nreptile ancestor. The analogy between the shedding of the coat in a\r\nsnake and the moulting of a bird is not uninstructive. In both cases the\r\nouter skin or epidermis is shedding an old growth, to be replaced by\r\na new one. The covering or horny part of the scale and the feather are\r\nalike growths from the epidermis, and the initial stages of the growth\r\nhave certain analogies. But beyond this general conviction that the\r\nfeather is a development of the scale, we cannot proceed with any\r\nconfidence. Nor need we linger in attempting to trace the gradual\r\nmodification of the skeleton, owing to the material change in habits.\r\nThe horny beak and the reduction of the toes are features we have\r\nalready encountered in the reptile, and the modification of the pelvis,\r\nbreast-bone, and clavicle are a natural outcome of flight.\r\n\r\nIn the Chalk period we find a large number of bird remains, of about\r\nthirty different species, and in some respects they resume the story of\r\nthe evolution of the bird. They are widely removed from our modern types\r\nof birds, and still have teeth in the jaws. They are of two leading\r\ntypes, of which the Ichthyornis and Hesperornis are the standard\r\nspecimens. The Ichthyornis was a small, tern-like bird with the power of\r\nflight strongly developed, as we may gather from the frame of its wings\r\nand the keel-shaped structure of its breast-bone. Its legs and feet were\r\nsmall and slender, and its long, slender jaws had about twenty teeth on\r\neach side at the bottom. No modern bird has teeth; though the fact that\r\nin some modern species we find the teeth appearing in a rudimentary\r\nform is another illustration of the law that animals tend to reproduce\r\nancestral features in their development. A more reptilian character in\r\nthe Ichthyornis group is the fact that, unlike any modern bird, but like\r\ntheir reptile ancestors, they had biconcave vertebrae. The brain was\r\nrelatively poor. We are still dealing with a type intermediate in\r\nsome respects between the reptile and the modern bird. The gannets,\r\ncormorants, and pelicans are believed to descend from some branch of\r\nthis group.\r\n\r\nThe other group of Cretaceous birds, of the Hesperornis type, show an\r\nactual degeneration of the power of flight through adaptation to an\r\nenvironment in which it was not needed, as happened, later, in the kiwi\r\nof New Zealand, and is happening in the case of the barn-yard fowl.\r\nThese birds had become divers. Their wings had shrunk into an abortive\r\nbone, while their powerful legs had been peculiarly fitted for diving.\r\nThey stood out at right angles to the body, and seem to have developed\r\npaddles. The whole frame suggests that the bird could neither walk nor\r\nfly, but was an excellent diver and swimmer. Not infrequently as large\r\nas an ostrich (five to six feet high), with teeth set in grooves in\r\nits jaws, and the jaws themselves joined as in the snake, with a great\r\ncapacity of bolting its prey, the Hesperornis would become an important\r\nelement in the life of the fishes. The wing-fingers have gone, and the\r\ntail is much shortened, but the grooved teeth and loosely jointed jaws\r\nstill point back to a reptilian ancestry.\r\n\r\nThese are the only remains of bird-life that we find in the Mesozoic\r\nrocks. Admirably as they illustrate the evolution of the bird from the\r\nreptile, they seem to represent a relatively poor development and spread\r\nof one of the most advanced organisms of the time. It must be understood\r\nthat, as we shall see, the latter part of the Chalk period does not\r\nbelong to the depression, the age of genial climate, which I call the\r\nMiddle Ages of the earth, but to the revolutionary period which closes\r\nit. We may say that the bird, for all its advances in organisation,\r\nremains obscure and unprosperous as long as the Age of Reptiles\r\nlasts. It awaits the next massive uplift of the land and lowering of\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier chapter I hinted that the bird and the mammal may have\r\nbeen the supreme outcomes of the series of disturbances which closed\r\nthe Primary Epoch and devastated its primitive population. As far as\r\nthe bird is concerned, this may be doubted on the ground that it first\r\nappears in the upper or later Jurassic, and is even then still largely\r\nreptilian in character. We must remember, however, that the elevation\r\nof the land and the cold climate lasted until the second part of the\r\nTriassic, and it is generally agreed that the bird may have been evolved\r\nin the Triassic. Its slow progress after that date is not difficult to\r\nunderstand. The advantage of a four-chambered heart and warm coat would\r\nbe greatly reduced when the climate became warmer. The stimulus to\r\nadvance would relax. The change from a coat of scales to a coat of\r\nfeathers obviously means adaptation to a low temperature, and there is\r\nnothing to prevent us from locating it in the Triassic, and indeed no\r\nlater known period of cold in which to place it.\r\n\r\nIt is much clearer that the mammals were a product of the Permian\r\nrevolution. They not only abound throughout the Jurassic, in which they\r\nare distributed in more than thirty genera, but they may be traced into\r\nthe Triassic itself. Both in North America and Europe we find the\r\nteeth and fragments of the jaws of small animals which are generally\r\nrecognised as mammals. We cannot, of course, from a few bones deduce\r\nthat there already, in the Triassic, existed an animal with a fully\r\ndeveloped coat of fur and an apparatus, however crude, in the breast for\r\nsuckling the young. But these bones so closely resemble the bones of the\r\nlowest mammals of to-day that this seems highly probable. In the latter\r\npart of the long period of cold it seems that some reptile exchanged its\r\nscales for tufts of hair, developed a four-chambered heart, and began\r\nthe practice of nourishing the young from its own blood which would give\r\nthe mammals so great an ascendancy in a colder world.\r\n\r\nNor can we complain of any lack of evidence connecting the mammal with a\r\nreptile ancestor. The earliest remains we find are of such a nature that\r\nthe highest authorities are still at variance as to whether they should\r\nbe classed as reptilian or mammalian. A skull and a fore limb from\r\nthe Triassic of South Africa (Tritylodon and Theriodesmus) are in\r\nthis predicament. It will be remembered that we divided the primitive\r\nreptiles of the Permian period into two great groups, the Diapsids and\r\nSynapsids (or Theromorphs). The former group have spread into the\r\ngreat reptiles of the Jurassic; the latter have remained in comparative\r\nobscurity. One branch of these Theromorph reptiles approach the mammals\r\nso closely in the formation of the teeth that they have received the\r\nname \"of the Theriodonts\", or \"beast-toothed\" reptiles. Their teeth are,\r\nlike those of the mammals, divided into incisors, canines (sometimes\r\nseveral inches long), and molars; and the molars have in some cases\r\ndeveloped cusps or tubercles. As the earlier remains of mammals which\r\nwe find are generally teeth and jaws, the resemblance of the two groups\r\nleads to some confusion in classifying them, but from our point of view\r\nit is not unwelcome. It narrows the supposed gulf between the reptile\r\nand the mammal, and suggests very forcibly the particular branch of the\r\nreptiles to which we may look for the ancestry of the mammals. We cannot\r\nsay that these Theriodont reptiles were the ancestors of the mammals.\r\nBut we may conclude with some confidence that they bring us near to the\r\npoint of origin, and probably had at least a common ancestor with the\r\nmammals.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the Theriodonts suggests a further idea of interest\r\nin regard to the origin of the mammals. It would be improper to press\r\nthis view in the present state of our knowledge, yet it offers a\r\nplausible theory of the origin of the mammals. The Theriodonts seem to\r\nhave been generally confined to the southern continent, Gondwana Land\r\n(Brazil to Australia), of which an area survives in South Africa. It is\r\nthere also that we find the early disputed remains of mammals. Now we\r\nsaw that, during the Permian, Gondwana Land was heavily coated with ice,\r\nand it seems natural to suppose that the severe cold which the glacial\r\nfields would give to the whole southern continent was the great agency\r\nin the evolution of the highest type of the animal world. From this\r\nsouthern land the new-born mammals spread northward and eastward with\r\ngreat rapidity. Fitted as they were to withstand the rigorous conditions\r\nwhich held the reptiles and amphibia in check, they seemed destined to\r\nattain at once the domination of the earth. Then, as we saw, the\r\nland was revelled once more until its surface broke into a fresh\r\nsemi-tropical luxuriance, and the Deinosaurs advanced to their triumph.\r\nThe mammals shrank into a meagre and insignificant population, a\r\nscattered tribe of small insect-eating animals, awaiting a fresh\r\nrefrigeration of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe remains of these interesting early mammals, restricted, as they\r\ngenerally are, to jaws and teeth and a few other bones that cannot\r\nin themselves be too confidently distinguished from those of certain\r\nreptiles, may seem insufficient to enable us to form a picture of their\r\nliving forms. In this, however, we receive a singular and fortunate\r\nassistance. Some of them are found living in nature to-day, and their\r\ndistinctly reptilian features would, even if no fossil remains were in\r\nexistence, convince us of the evolution of the mammals.\r\n\r\nThe southern continent on which we suppose the mammals to have\r\noriginated had its eastern termination in Australia. New Zealand seems\r\nto have been detached early in the Mesozoic, and was never reached by\r\nthe mammals. Tasmania was still part of the Australian continent. To\r\nthis extreme east of the southern continent the early mammals spread,\r\nand then, during either the Jurassic or the Cretaceous, the sea\r\ncompleted its inroad, and severed Australia permanently from the rest of\r\nthe earth. The obvious result of this was to shelter the primitive life\r\nof Australia from invasion by higher types, especially from the great\r\ncarnivorous mammals which would presently develop. Australia became, in\r\nother words, a \"protected area,\" in which primitive types of life were\r\npreserved from destruction, and were at the same time sheltered from\r\nthose stimulating agencies which compelled the rest of the world to\r\nadvance. \"Advance Australia\" is the fitting motto of the present human\r\ninhabitants of that promising country; but the standard of progress has\r\nbeen set up in a land which had remained during millions of years the\r\nChinese Empire of the living world. Australia is a fragment of the\r\nMiddle Ages of the earth, a province fenced round by nature at least\r\nthree million years ago and preserving, amongst its many invaluable\r\ntypes of life, representatives of that primitive mammal population which\r\nwe are seeking to understand.\r\n\r\nIt is now well known that the Duckbill or Platypus (Ornithorhyncus)\r\nand the Spiny Anteater (Echidna) of Australia and Tasmania--with one\r\nrepresentative of the latter in New Guinea, which seems to have been\r\nstill connected--are semi-reptilian survivors of the first animals to\r\nsuckle their young. Like the reptiles they lay tough-coated eggs\r\nand have a single outlet for the excreta, and they have a reptilian\r\narrangement of the bones of the shoulder-girdle; like the mammals, they\r\nhave a coat of hair and a four-chambered heart, and they suckle the\r\nyoung. Even in their mammalian features they are, as the careful\r\nresearch of Australian zoologists has shown, of a transitional type.\r\nThey are warm-blooded, but their temperature is much lower than that\r\nof other mammals, and varies appreciably with the temperature of their\r\nsurroundings. [*] Their apparatus for suckling the young is primitive.\r\nThere are no teats, and the milk is forced by the mother through simple\r\nchannels upon the breast, from which it is licked by the young. The\r\nAnteater develops her eggs in a pouch. They illustrate a very early\r\nstage in the development of a mammal from a reptile; and one is almost\r\ntempted to see in their timorous burrowing habits a reminiscence of the\r\nimpotence of the early mammals after their premature appearance in the\r\nTriassic.\r\n\r\n     * See Lucas and Le Soulf's Animals of Australia, 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next level of mammal life, the highest level that it attains in\r\nAustralia (apart from recent invasions), is the Marsupial. The pouched\r\nanimals (kangaroo, wallaby, etc.) are the princes of pre-human life in\r\nAustralia, and represent the highest point that life had reached when\r\nthat continent was cut off from the rest of the world. A few words on\r\nthe real significance of the pouch, from which they derive their name,\r\nwill suffice to explain their position in the story of evolution.\r\n\r\nAmong the reptiles the task of the mother ends, as a rule, with the\r\nlaying of the egg. One or two modern reptiles hatch the eggs, or show\r\nsome concern for them, but the characteristic of the reptile is to\r\ndischarge its eggs upon the warm earth and trouble no further about its\r\nyoung. It is a reminiscence of the warm primitive earth. The bird and\r\nmammal, born of the cooling of the earth, exhibit the beginning of\r\nthat link between mother and offspring which will prove so important an\r\nelement in the higher and later life of the globe. The bird assists the\r\ndevelopment of the eggs with the heat of her own body, and feeds the\r\nyoung. The mammal develops the young within the body, and then feeds\r\nthem at the breast.\r\n\r\nBut there is a gradual advance in this process. The Duckbill lays its\r\neggs just like the reptile, but provides a warm nest for them at the\r\nbottom of its burrow. The Anteater develops a temporary pouch in its\r\nbody, when it lays an egg, and hatches the egg in it. The Marsupial\r\nretains the egg in its womb until the young is advanced in development,\r\nthen transfers the young to the pouch, and forces milk into its mouth\r\nfrom its breasts. The real reason for this is that the Marsupial falls\r\nfar short of the higher mammals in the structure of the womb, and cannot\r\nfully develop its young therein. It has no placenta, or arrangement by\r\nwhich the blood-vessels of the mother are brought into connection with\r\nthe blood-vessels of the foetus, in order to supply it with food until\r\nit is fully developed. The Marsupial, in fact, only rises above the\r\nreptile in hatching the egg within its own body, and then suckling the\r\nyoung at the breast.\r\n\r\nThese primitive mammals help us to reconstruct the mammal life of\r\nthe Mesozoic Epoch. The bones that we have are variously described\r\nin geological manuals as the remains of Monotremes, Marsupials, and\r\nInsectivores. Many of them, if not most, were no doubt insect-eating\r\nanimals, but there is no ground for supposing that what are technically\r\nknown as Insectivores (moles and shrews) existed in the Mesozoic. On\r\nthe other hand, the lower jaw of the Marsupial is characterised by a\r\npeculiar hooklike process, and this is commonly found in Mesozoic jaws.\r\nThis circumstance, and the witness of Australia, permit us, perhaps,\r\nto regard the Jurassic mammals as predominantly marsupial. It is more\r\ndifficult to identify Monotreme remains, but the fact that Monotremes\r\nhave survived to this day in Australia, and the resemblance of some\r\nof the Mesozoic teeth to those found for a time in the young Duckbill\r\njustify us in assuming that a part of the Mesozoic mammals correspond to\r\nthe modern Monotremes. Not single specimen of any higher, or placental,\r\nmammal has yet been found in the whole Mesozoic Era.\r\n\r\nWe must, however, beware of simply transferring to the Mesozoic world\r\nthe kinds of Monotremes and Marsupials which we know in nature to-day.\r\nIn some of the excellent \"restorations\" of Mesozoic life which are found\r\nin recent illustrated literature the early mammal is represented with an\r\nexternal appearance like that of the Duckbill. This is an error, as the\r\nDuckbill has been greatly modified in its extremities and mouth-parts\r\nby its aquatic and burrowing habits. As we have no complete skeletons\r\nof these early mammals we must abstain from picturing their external\r\nappearance. It is enough that the living Monotreme and Marsupial so\r\nfinely illustrate the transition from a reptilian to a mammalian form.\r\nThere may have been types more primitive than the Duckbill, and others\r\nbetween the Duckbill and the Marsupial. It seems clear, at least,\r\nthat two main branches, the Monotremes and Marsupials, arose from the\r\nprimitive mammalian root. Whether either of these became in turn the\r\nparent of the higher mammals we will inquire later. We must first\r\nconsider the fresh series of terrestrial disturbances which, like some\r\ngigantic sieve, weeded out the grosser types of organisms, and cleared\r\nthe earth for a rapid and remarkable expansion of these primitive birds\r\nand mammals.\r\n\r\nWe have attended only to a few prominent characters in tracing the line\r\nof evolution, but it will be understood that an advance in many organs\r\nof the body is implied in these changes. In the lower mammals the\r\ndiaphragm, or complete partition between the organs of the breast and\r\nthose of the abdomen, is developed. It is not a sudden and mysterious\r\ngrowth, and its development in the embryo to-day corresponds to the\r\nsuggestion of its development which the zoologist gathers from the\r\nanimal series. The ear also is now fully developed. How far the fish\r\nhas a sense of hearing is not yet fully determined, but the amphibian\r\ncertainly has an organ for the perception of waves of sound. Parts of\r\nthe discarded gill-arches are gradually transformed into the three bones\r\nof the mammal's internal ear; just as other parts are converted into\r\nmouth cartilages, and as--it is believed--one of the gill clefts is\r\nconverted into the Eustachian tube. In the Monotreme and Marsupial the\r\near-hole begins to be covered with a shell of cartilage; we have the\r\nbeginning of the external ear. The jaws, which are first developed\r\nin the fish, now articulate more perfectly with the skull. Fat-glands\r\nappear in the skin, and it is probably from a group of these that the\r\nmilk-glands are developed. The origin of the hairs is somewhat obscure.\r\nThey are not thought to be, like the bird's feathers, modifications of\r\nthe reptile's scales, but to have been evolved from other structures in\r\nthe skin, possibly under the protection of the scales.\r\n\r\nMy purpose is, however, rather to indicate the general causes of\r\nthe onward advance of life than to study organs in detail--a vast\r\nsubject--or construct pedigrees. We therefore pass on to consider the\r\nnext great stride that is taken by the advancing life of the earth.\r\nMillions of years of genial climate and rich vegetation have filled\r\nthe earth with a prolific and enormously varied population. Over this\r\npopulation the hand of natural selection is outstretched, as it were,\r\nand we are about to witness another gigantic removal of older types of\r\nlife and promotion of those which contain the germs of further advance.\r\nAs we have already explained, natural selection is by no means inactive\r\nduring these intervening periods of warmth. We have seen the ammonites\r\nand reptiles, and even the birds and mammals, evolve into hundreds\r\nof species during the Jurassic period. The constant evolution of more\r\neffective types of carnivores and their spread into new regions, the\r\ncontinuous changes in the distribution of land and water, the struggle\r\nfor food in a growing population, and a dozen other causes, are ever at\r\nwork. But the great and comprehensive changes in the face of the earth\r\nwhich close the eras of the geologist seem to give a deeper and quicker\r\nstimulus to its population and result in periods of especially rapid\r\nevolution. Such a change now closes the Mesozoic Era, and inaugurates\r\nthe age of flowering plants, of birds, and of mammals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. IN THE DAYS OF THE CHALK\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the view of the later story of the earth which was\r\nexpressed on an earlier page, we now come to the second of the three\r\ngreat revolutions which have quickened the pulse of life on the earth.\r\nMany men of science resent the use of the word revolution, and it is\r\nnot without some danger. It was once thought that the earth was really\r\nshaken at times by vast and sudden cataclysms, which destroyed its\r\nentire living population, so that new kingdoms of plants and animals\r\nhad to be created. But we have interpreted the word revolution in a very\r\ndifferent sense. The series of changes and disturbances to which we give\r\nthe name extended over a period of hundreds of thousands of years,\r\nand they were themselves, in some sense, the creators of new types\r\nof organisms. Yet they are periods that stand out peculiarly in\r\nthe comparatively even chronicle of the earth. The Permian period\r\ntransformed the face of the earth; it lifted the low-lying land into\r\na massive relief, drew mantles of ice over millions of miles of its\r\nsurface, set volcanoes belching out fire and fumes in many parts,\r\nstripped it of its great forests, and slew the overwhelming majority\r\nof its animals. On the scale of geological time it may be called a\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that the series of disturbances which close the\r\nSecondary and inaugurate the Tertiary Era cannot so conveniently be\r\nsummed up in a single formula. They begin long before the end of the\r\nMesozoic, and they continue far into the Tertiary, with intervals of\r\nease and tranquillity. There seems to have been no culminating point in\r\nthe series when the uplifted earth shivered in a mantle of ice and\r\nsnow. Yet I propose to retain for this period--beginning early in the\r\nCretaceous (Chalk) period and extending into the Tertiary--the name of\r\nthe Cretaceous Revolution. I drew a fanciful parallel between the three\r\nrevolutions which have quickened the earth since the sluggish days of\r\nthe Coal-forest and the three revolutionary movements which have changed\r\nthe life of modern Europe. It will be remembered that, whereas the first\r\nof these European revolutions was a sharp and massive upheaval,\r\nthe second consisted in a more scattered and irregular series of\r\ndisturbances, spread over the fourth and fifth decades of the nineteenth\r\ncentury; but they amounted, in effect, to a revolution.\r\n\r\nSo it is with the Cretaceous Revolution. In effect it corresponds very\r\nclosely to the Permian Revolution. On the physical side it includes a\r\nvery considerable rise of the land over the greater part of the globe,\r\nand the formation of lofty chains of mountains; on the botanical side\r\nit means the reduction of the rich Mesozoic flora to a relatively\r\ninsignificant population, and the appearance and triumphant spread of\r\nthe flowering plants, on the zoological side it witnesses the complete\r\nextinction of the Ammonites, Deinosaurs, and Pterosaurs, an immense\r\nreduction of the reptile world generally, and a victorious expansion of\r\nthe higher insects, birds, and mammals; on the climatic side it provides\r\nthe first definite evidence of cold zones of the earth and cold seasons\r\nof the year, and seems to represent a long, if irregular, period of\r\ncomparative cold. Except, to some extent, the last of these points,\r\nthere is no difference of opinion, and therefore, from the evolutionary\r\npoint of view, the Cretaceous period merits the title of a revolution.\r\nAll these things were done before the Tertiary period opened.\r\n\r\nLet us first consider the fundamental and physical aspect of this\r\nrevolution, the upheaval of the land. It began about the close of the\r\nJurassic period. Western and Central Europe emerged considerably from\r\nthe warm Jurassic sea, which lay on it and had converted it into an\r\narchipelago. In North-western America also there was an emergence of\r\nlarge areas of land, and the Sierra and Cascade ranges of mountains were\r\nformed about the same time. For reasons which will appear later we must\r\nnote carefully this rise of land at the very beginning of the Cretaceous\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nHowever, the sea recovered its lost territory, or compensation for it,\r\nand the middle of the Cretaceous period witnessed a very considerable\r\nextension of the waters over America, Europe, and southern Asia. The\r\nthick familiar beds of chalk, which stretch irregularly from Ireland to\r\nthe Crimea, and from the south of Sweden to the south of France, plainly\r\ntell of an overlying sea. As is well known, the chalk consists mainly\r\nof the shells or outer frames of minute one-celled creatures\r\n(Thalamophores) which float in the ocean, and form a deep ooze at its\r\nbottom with their discarded skeletons. What depth this ocean must have\r\nbeen is disputed, and hardly concerns us. It is clear that it must have\r\ntaken an enormous period for microscopic shells to form the thick masses\r\nof chalk which cover so much of southern and eastern England. On the\r\nlowest estimates the Cretaceous period, which includes the deposit of\r\nother strata besides chalk, lasted about three million years. And as\r\npeople like to have some idea of the time since these things happened,\r\nI may add that, on the lowest estimate (which most geologists would at\r\nleast double), it is about three million years since the last stretches\r\nof the chalk-ocean disappeared from the surface of Europe.\r\n\r\nBut while our chalk cliffs conjure up a vision of England lying deep--at\r\nleast twenty or thirty fathoms deep--below a warm ocean, in which\r\ngigantic Ammonites and Belemnites and sharks ply their deadly trade,\r\nthey also remind us of the last phase of the remarkable life of the\r\nearth's Middle Ages. In the latter part of the Cretaceous the land\r\nrises. The chalk ocean of Europe is gradually reduced to a series of\r\ninland seas, separated by masses and ridges of land, and finally to a\r\nseries of lakes of brackish water. The masses of the Pyrenees and Alps\r\nbegin to rise; though it will not be until a much later date that they\r\nreach anything like their present elevation. In America the change is\r\neven greater. A vast ridge rises along the whole western front of the\r\ncontinent, lifting and draining it, from Alaska to Cape Horn. It is\r\nthe beginning of the Rocky Mountains and the Andes. Even during the\r\nCretaceous period there had been rich forests of Mesozoic vegetation\r\ncovering about a hundred thousand square miles in the Rocky Mountains\r\nregion. Europe and America now begin to show their modern contours.\r\n\r\nIt is important to notice that this great uprise of the land and the\r\nseries of disturbances it entails differ from those which we summed\r\nup in the phrase Permian Revolution. The differences may help us to\r\nunderstand some of the changes in the living population. The chief\r\ndifference is that the disturbances are more local, and not nearly\r\nsimultaneous. There is a considerable emergence of land at the end of\r\nthe Jurassic, then a fresh expansion of the sea, then a great rise of\r\nmountains at the end of the Cretaceous, and so on. We shall find our\r\ngreat mountain-masses (the Pyrenees, Alps, Himalaya, etc.) rising at\r\nintervals throughout the whole of the Tertiary Era. However, it suffices\r\nfor the moment to observe that in the latter part of the Mesozoic and\r\nearly part of the Tertiary there were considerable upheavals of the land\r\nin various regions, and that the Mesozoic Era closed with a very much\r\nlarger proportion of dry land, and a much higher relief of the\r\nland, than there had been during the Jurassic period. The series of\r\ndisturbances was, says Professor Chamberlin, \"greater than any that had\r\noccurred since the close of the Palaeozoic.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the previous effect of the Permian upheaval, and from the fact that\r\nthe living population is now similarly annihilated or reduced, we should\r\nat once expect to find a fresh change in the climate of the earth. Here,\r\nhowever, our procedure is not so easy. In the Permian age we had\r\nsolid proof in the shape of vast glaciated regions. It is claimed by\r\ncontinental geologists that certain early Tertiary beds in Bavaria\r\nactually prove a similar, but smaller, glaciation in Europe, but this is\r\ndisputed. Other beds may yet be found, but we saw that there was not\r\na general upheaval, as there had been in the Permian, and it is quite\r\npossible that there were few or no ice-fields. We do not, in fact, know\r\nthe causes of the Permian icefields. We are thrown upon the plant\r\nand animal remains, and seem to be in some danger of inferring a cold\r\nclimate from the organic remains, and then explaining the new types of\r\norganisms by the cold climate. This, of course, we shall not do. The\r\ndifficulty is made greater by the extreme disinclination of many recent\r\ngeologists, and some recent botanists who have too easily followed the\r\ngeologists, to admit a plain climatic interpretation of the facts. Let\r\nus first see what the facts are.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the Jurassic we find three different zones of\r\nAmmonites: one in the latitude of the Mediterranean, one in the latitude\r\nof Central Europe, and one further north. Most geologists conclude that\r\nthese differences indicate zones of climate (not hitherto indicated),\r\nbut it cannot be proved, and we may leave the matter open. At the same\r\ntime the warm-loving corals disappear from Europe, with occasional\r\nadvances. It is said that they are driven out by the disturbance of the\r\nwaters, and, although this would hardly explain why they did not spread\r\nagain in the tranquil chalk-ocean, we may again leave the point open.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the Cretaceous, however, the Angiosperms (flowering\r\nplants) suddenly break into the chronicle of the earth, and spread with\r\ngreat rapidity. They appear abruptly in the east of the North American\r\ncontinent, in the region of Virginia and Maryland. They are small in\r\nstature and primitive in structure. Some are of generalised forms that\r\nare now unknown; some have leaves approaching those of the oak, willow,\r\nelm, maple, and walnut; some may be definitely described as fig,\r\nsassafras, aralia, myrica, etc. Eastern America, it may be recalled, is\r\nmuch higher than western until the close of the Cretaceous period. The\r\nAngiosperms do not spread much westward; they appear next in Greenland,\r\nand, before the middle of the Cretaceous, in Portugal. They have\r\ntravelled over the North Atlantic continent, or what remains of it. The\r\nprocess seems very rapid as we write it, but it must be remembered that\r\nthe first half of the Cretaceous period means a million or a million and\r\na half years.\r\n\r\nThe cycads, and even the conifers, shrink before the higher type of\r\ntree. The landscape, in Europe and America, begins to wear a modern\r\naspect. Long before the end of the Cretaceous most of the modern genera\r\nof Angiosperm trees have developed. To the fig and sassafras are now\r\nadded the birch, beech, oak, poplar, walnut, willow, ivy, mulberry,\r\nholly, laurel, myrtle, maple, oleander, magnolia, plane, bread-fruit,\r\nand sweet-gum. Most of the American trees of to-day are known. The\r\nsequoias (the giant Californian trees) still represent the conifers in\r\ngreat abundance, with the eucalyptus and other plants that are now found\r\nonly much further south. The ginkgoes struggle on for a time. The cycads\r\ndwindle enormously. Of 700 specimens in one early Cretaceous deposit\r\nonly 96 are Angiosperms; of 460 species in a later deposit about 400 are\r\nAngiosperms. They oust the cycads in Europe and America, as the cycads\r\nand conifers had ousted the Cryptogams. The change in the face of the\r\nearth would be remarkable. Instead of the groves of palm-like cycads,\r\nwith their large and flower-like fructifications, above which the pines\r\nand firs and cypresses reared their sombre forms, there were now forests\r\nof delicate-leaved maples, beeches, and oaks, bearing nutritious fruit\r\nfor the coming race of animals. Grasses also and palms begin in the\r\nCretaceous; though the grasses would at first be coarse and isolated\r\ntufts. Even flowers, of the lily family (apparently), are still detected\r\nin the crushed and petrified remains.\r\n\r\nWe will give some consideration later to the evolution of the\r\nAngiosperms. For the moment it is chiefly important to notice a feature\r\nof them to which the botanist pays less attention. In his technical view\r\nthe Angiosperm is distinguished by the structure of its reproductive\r\napparatus, its flowers, and some recent botanists wonder whether the\r\nkey to this expansion of the flowering plants may not be found in a\r\ndevelopment of the insect world and of its relation to vegetation. In\r\npoint of fact, we have no geological indication of any great development\r\nof the insects until the Tertiary Era, when we shall find them deploying\r\ninto a vast army and producing their highest types. In any case, such\r\na view leaves wholly unexplained the feature of the Angiosperms which\r\nchiefly concerns us. This is that most of them shed the whole of their\r\nleaves periodically, as the winter approaches. No such trees had yet\r\nbeen known on the earth. All trees hitherto had been evergreen, and we\r\nneed a specific and adequate explanation why the earth is now covered,\r\nin the northern region, with forests of trees which show naked boughs\r\nand branches during a part of the year.\r\n\r\nThe majority of palaeontologists conclude at once, and quite\r\nconfidently, from this rise and spread of the deciduous trees, that a\r\nwinter season has at length set in on the earth, and that this new type\r\nof vegetation appears in response to an appreciable lowering of the\r\nclimate. The facts, however, are somewhat complex, and we must proceed\r\nwith caution. It would seem that any general lowering of the temperature\r\nof the earth ought to betray itself first in Greenland, but the flora\r\nof Greenland remains far \"warmer,\" so to say, than the flora of Central\r\nEurope is to-day. Even toward the close of the Cretaceous its plants\r\nare much the same as those of America or of Central Europe. Its fossil\r\nremains of that time include forty species of ferns, as well as cycads,\r\nginkgoes, figs, bamboos, and magnolias. Sir A. Geikie ventures to say\r\nthat it must then have enjoyed a climate like that of the Cape or of\r\nAustralia to-day. Professor Chamberlin finds its flora like that of\r\n\"warm temperate\" regions, and says that plants which then flourished in\r\nlatitude 72 degrees are not now found above latitude 30 degrees.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, various reasons to believe that it is unsafe to draw\r\ndeductions from the climate of Greenland. There is, it is true, some\r\nexaggeration in the statement that its climate was equivalent to that\r\nof Central Europe. The palms which flourished in Central Europe did not\r\nreach Greenland, and there are differences in the northern Molluscs\r\nand Echinoderms which--like the absence of corals above the north of\r\nEngland--point to a diversity of temperature. But we have no right to\r\nexpect that there would be the same difference in temperature between\r\nGreenland and Central Europe as we find to-day. If the warm current\r\nwhich is now diverted to Europe across the Atlantic--the Gulf\r\nStream--had then continued up the coast of America, and flowed along\r\nthe coast of the land that united America and Europe, the climatic\r\nconditions would be very different from what they are. There is a more\r\nsubstantial reason. We saw that during the Mesozoic the Arctic continent\r\nwas very largely submerged, and, while Europe and America rise again at\r\nthe end of the Cretaceous, we find no rise of the land further north. A\r\ndifference of elevation would, in such a world, make a great difference\r\nin temperature and moisture.\r\n\r\nLet us examine the animal record, however, before we come to any\r\nconclusion. The chronicle of the later Cretaceous is a story of\r\ndevastation. The reduction of the cyeads is insignificant beside the\r\nreduction or annihilation of the great animals of the Mesozoic world.\r\nThe skeletons of the Deinosaurs become fewer and fewer as we ascend the\r\nupper Cretaceous strata. In the uppermost layer (Laramie) we find\r\ntraces of a last curious expansion--the group of horned reptiles, of the\r\nTriceratops type, which we described as the last of the great\r\nreptiles. The Ichthyosaurs and Plesiosaurs vanish from the waters. The\r\n\"sea-serpents\" (Mososaurs) pass away without a survivor. The flying\r\ndragons, large and small, become entirely extinct. Only crocodiles,\r\nlizards, turtle, and snakes cross the threshold of the Tertiary Era. In\r\none single region of America (Puerco beds) some of the great reptiles\r\nseem to be making a last stand against the advancing enemy in the dawn\r\nof the Tertiary Era, but the exact date of the beds is disputed, and\r\nin any case their fight is soon over. Something has slain the most\r\nformidable race that the earth had yet known, in spite of its marvellous\r\nadaptation to different environments in its innumerable branches.\r\n\r\nWe turn to the seas, and find an equal carnage among some of its most\r\nadvanced inhabitants. The great cuttlefish-like Belemnites and the whole\r\nrace of the Ammonites, large and small, are banished from the earth. The\r\nfall of the Ammonites is particularly interesting, and has inspired\r\nmuch more or less fantastic speculation. The shells begin to assume such\r\nstrange forms that observers speak occasionally of the \"convulsions\" or\r\n\"death-contortions\" of the expiring race. Some of the coiled shells take\r\non a spiral form, like that of a snail's shell. Some uncoil the shell,\r\nand seem to be returning toward the primitive type. A rich eccentricity\r\nof frills and ornamentation is found more or less throughout the whole\r\nrace. But every device--if we may so regard these changes--is useless,\r\nand the devastating agency of the Cretaceous, whatever it was, removes\r\nthe Ammonites and Belemnites from the scene. The Mollusc world, like the\r\nworld of plants and of reptiles, approaches its modern aspect.\r\n\r\nIn the fish world, too, there is an effective selection in the course of\r\nthe Cretaceous. All the fishes of modern times, except the large\r\nfamily of the sharks, rays, skates, and dog-fishes (Elasmobranchs), the\r\nsturgeon and chimaera, the mud-fishes, and a very few other types, are\r\nTeleosts, or bony-framed fishes--the others having cartilaginous frames.\r\nNone of the Teleosts had appeared until the end of the Jurassic. They\r\nnow, like the flowering plants on land, not only herald the new age,\r\nbut rapidly oust the other fishes, except the unconquerable shark. They\r\ngradually approach the familiar types of Teleosts, so that we may say\r\nthat before the end of the Cretaceous the waters swarmed with primitive\r\nand patriarchal cod, salmon, herring, perch, pike, bream, eels, and\r\nother fishes. Some of them grew to an enormous size. The Portheus,\r\nan American pike, seems to have been about eight feet long; and the\r\nactivity of an eight-foot pike may be left to the angler's imagination.\r\nAll, however, are, as evolution demands, of a generalised and unfamiliar\r\ntype: the material out of which our fishes will be evolved.\r\n\r\nOf the insects we have very little trace in the Cretaceous. We shall\r\nfind them developing with great richness in the following period, but,\r\nimperfect as the record is, we may venture to say that they were checked\r\nin the Cretaceous. There were good conditions for preserving them, but\r\nfew are preserved. And of the other groups of invertebrates we need only\r\nsay that they show a steady advance toward modern types. The sea-lily\r\nfills the rocks no longer; the sea-urchin is very abundant. The Molluscs\r\ngain on the more lowly organised Brachiopods.\r\n\r\nTo complete the picture we must add that higher types probably arose\r\nin the later Cretaceous which do not appear in the records. This is\r\nparticularly true of the birds and mammals. We find them spreading\r\nso early in the Tertiary that we must put back the beginning of the\r\nexpansion to the Cretaceous. As yet, however, the only mammal remains\r\nwe find are such jaws and teeth of primitive mammals as we have already\r\ndescribed. The birds we described (after the Archaeopteryx) also belong\r\nto the Cretaceous, and they form another of the doomed races. Probably\r\nthe modern birds were already developing among the new vegetation on the\r\nhigher ground.\r\n\r\nThese are the facts of Cretaceous life, as far as the record has yielded\r\nthem, and it remains for us to understand them. Clearly there has been\r\na great selective process analogous to, if not equal to, the winnowing\r\nprocess at the end of the Palaeozoic. As there has been a similar, if\r\nless considerable, upheaval of the land, we are at once tempted to think\r\nthat the great selective agency was a lowering of the temperature. When\r\nwe further find that the most important change in the animal world is\r\nthe destruction of the cold-blooded reptiles, which have no concern for\r\nthe young, and the luxuriant spread of the warm-blooded animals, which\r\ndo care for their young, the idea is greatly confirmed. When we add\r\nthat the powerful Molluscs which are slain, while the humbler Molluscs\r\nsurvive, are those which--to judge from the nautilus and octopus--love\r\nwarm seas, the impression is further confirmed. And when we finally\r\nreflect that the most distinctive phenomenon of the period is the rapid\r\nspread of deciduous trees, it would seem that there is only one possible\r\ninterpretation of the Cretaceous Revolution.\r\n\r\nThis interpretation--that cold was the selecting agency--is a familiar\r\nidea in geological literature, but, as I said, there are recent writers\r\nwho profess reserve in regard to it, and it is proper to glance at, or\r\nat least look for, the alternatives.\r\n\r\nBefore doing so let us be quite clear that here we have nothing to\r\ndo with theories of the origin of the earth. The Permian cold--which,\r\nhowever, is universally admitted--is more or less entangled in that\r\ncontroversy; the Cretaceous cold has no connection with it. Whatever\r\nexcess of carbon-dioxide there may have been in the early atmosphere\r\nwas cleared by the Coal-forests. We must set aside all these theories in\r\nexplaining the present facts.\r\n\r\nIt is also useful to note that the fact that there have been great\r\nchanges in the climate of the earth in past time is beyond dispute.\r\nThere is no denying the fact that the climate of the earth was warm from\r\nthe Arctic to the Antarctic in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods:\r\nthat it fell considerably in the Permian: that it again became at least\r\n\"warm temperate\" (Chamberlin) from the Arctic to the Antarctic in the\r\nJurassic, and again in the Eocene: that some millions of square miles\r\nof Europe and North America were covered with ice and snow in the\r\nPleistocene, so that the reindeer wandered where palms had previously\r\nflourished and the vine flourishes to-day; and that the pronounced zones\r\nof climate which we find today have no counterpart in any earlier\r\nage. In view of these great and admitted fluctuations of the earth's\r\ntemperature one does not see any reason for hesitating to admit a fall\r\nof temperature in the Cretaceous, if the facts point to it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the alternative suggestions are not very convincing.\r\nWe have noticed one of these suggestions in connection with the origin\r\nof the Angiosperms. It hints that this may be related to developments\r\nof the insect world. Most probably the development of the characteristic\r\nflowers of the Angiosperms is connected with an increasing relation\r\nto insects, but what we want to understand especially is the deciduous\r\ncharacter of their leaves. Many of the Angiosperms are evergreen, so\r\nthat it cannot be said that the one change entailed the other. In fact,\r\na careful study of the leaves preserved in the rocks seems to show\r\nthe deciduous Angiosperms gaining on the evergreens at the end of the\r\nCretaceous. The most natural, it not the only, interpretation of this is\r\nthat the temperature is falling. Deciduous trees shed their leaves so as\r\nto check their transpiration when a season comes on in which they cannot\r\nabsorb the normal amount of moisture. This may occur either at the\r\non-coming of a hot, dry season or of a cold season (in which the roots\r\nabsorb less). Everything suggests that the deciduous tree evolved to\r\nmeet an increase of cold, not of heat.\r\n\r\nAnother suggestion is that animals and plants were not \"climatically\r\ndifferentiated\" until the Cretaceous period; that is to say, that they\r\nwere adapted to all climates before that time, and then began to be\r\nsensitive to differences of climate, and live in different latitudes.\r\nBut how and why they should suddenly become differentiated in this way\r\nis so mysterious that one prefers to think that, as the animal remains\r\nalso suggest, there were no appreciable zones of climate until the\r\nCretaceous. The magnolia, for instance, flourished in Greenland in the\r\nearly Tertiary, and has to live very far south of it to-day. It is much\r\nsimpler to assume that Greenland changed--as a vast amount of evidence\r\nindicates--than that the magnolia changed.\r\n\r\nFinally, to explain the disappearance of the Mesozoic reptiles without a\r\nfall in temperature, it is suggested that they were exterminated by\r\nthe advancing mammals. It is assumed that the spreading world of the\r\nAngiospermous plants somewhere met the spread of the advancing mammals,\r\nand opened out a rich new granary to them. This led to so powerful\r\na development of the mammals that they succeeded in overthrowing the\r\nreptiles.\r\n\r\nThere are several serious difficulties in the way of this theory. The\r\nfirst and most decisive is that the great reptiles have practically\r\ndisappeared before the mammals come on the scene. Only in one series of\r\nbeds (Puerco) in America, representing an early period of the Tertiary\r\nEra, do we find any association of their remains; and even there it\r\nis not clear that they were contemporary. Over the earth generally the\r\ngeological record shows the great reptiles dying from some invisible\r\nscourge long before any mammal capable of doing them any harm appears;\r\neven if we suppose that the mammal mainly attacked the eggs and the\r\nyoung. We may very well believe that more powerful mammals than the\r\nprimitive Mesozoic specimens were already developed in some part of the\r\nearth--say, Africa--and that the rise of the land gave them a bridge\r\nacross the Mediterranean to Europe. Probably this happened; but the\r\nimportant point is that the reptiles were already almost extinct. The\r\ndifficulty is even greater when we reflect that it is precisely the\r\nmost powerful reptiles (Deinosaurs) and least accessible reptiles\r\n(Pterosaurs, Ichthyosaurs, etc.) which disappear, while the smaller land\r\nand water reptiles survive and retreat southward--where the mammals are\r\njust as numerous. That assuredly is not the effect of an invasion of\r\ncarnivores, even if we could overlook the absence of such carnivores\r\nfrom the record until after the extinction of the reptiles in most\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nI have entered somewhat fully into this point, partly because of\r\nits great interest, but partly lest it be thought that I am merely\r\nreproducing a tradition of geological literature without giving due\r\nattention to the criticisms of recent writers. The plain and common\r\ninterpretation of the Cretaceous revolution--that a fall in temperature\r\nwas its chief devastating agency--is the only one that brings harmony\r\ninto all the facts. The one comprehensive enemy of that vast reptile\r\npopulation was cold. It was fatal to the adult because he had a\r\nthree-chambered heart and no warm coat; it was fatal to the Mesozoic\r\nvegetation on which, directly or indirectly, he fed; it was fatal to his\r\neggs and young because the mother did not brood over the one or care\r\nfor the other. It was fatal to the Pterosaurs, even if they were\r\nwarm-blooded, because they had no warm coats and did not (presumably)\r\nhatch their eggs; and it was equally fatal to the viviparous\r\nIchthyosaurs. It is the one common fate that could slay all classes.\r\nWhen we find that the surviving reptiles retreat southward, only\r\nlingering in Europe during the renewed warmth of the Eocene and Miocene\r\nperiods, this interpretation is sufficiently confirmed. And when\r\nwe recollect that these things coincide with the extinction of the\r\nAmmonites and Belemnites, and the driving of their descendants further\r\nsouth, as well as the rise and triumph of deciduous trees, it is\r\ndifficult to see any ground for hesitating.\r\n\r\nBut we need not, and must not, imagine a period of cold as severe,\r\nprolonged, and general as that of the Permian period. The warmth of the\r\nJurassic period is generally attributed to the low relief of the land,\r\nand the very large proportion of water-surface. The effect of this would\r\nbe to increase the moisture in the atmosphere. Whether this was assisted\r\nby any abnormal proportion of carbon-dioxide, as in the Carboniferous,\r\nwe cannot confidently say. Professor Chamberlin observes that, since\r\nthe absorbing rock-surface was greatly reduced in the Jurassic, the\r\ncarbon-dioxide would tend to accumulate in its atmosphere, and help to\r\nexplain the high temperature. But the great spread of vegetation and the\r\nrise of land in the later Jurassic and the Cretaceous would reduce this\r\ndensity of the atmosphere, and help to lower the temperature.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the cold would at first be local. In fact, it must be\r\ncarefully realised that, when we speak of the Jurassic period as a time\r\nof uniform warmth, we mean uniform at the same altitude. Everybody knows\r\nthe effect of rising from the warm, moist sea-level to the top of even\r\na small inland elevation. There would be such cooler regions throughout\r\nthe Jurassic, and we saw that there were considerable upheavals of\r\nland towards its close. To these elevated lands we may look for the\r\ndevelopment of the Angiosperms, the birds, and the mammals. When\r\nthe more massive rise of land came at the end of the Cretaceous, the\r\ntemperature would fall over larger areas, and connecting ridges would\r\nbe established between one area and another. The Mesozoic plants and\r\nanimals would succumb to this advancing cold. What precise degree of\r\ncold was necessary to kill the reptiles and Cephalopods, yet allow\r\ncertain of the more delicate flowering plants to live, is yet to be\r\ndetermined. The vast majority of the new plants, with their winter\r\nsleep, would thrive in the cooler air, and, occupying the ground of\r\nthe retreating cycads and ginkgoes would prepare a rich harvest for the\r\ncoming birds and mammals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. THE TERTIARY ERA\r\n\r\nWe have already traversed nearly nine-tenths of the story of terrestrial\r\nlife, without counting the long and obscure Archaean period, and still\r\nfind ourselves in a strange and unfamiliar earth. With the close of the\r\nChalk period, however, we take a long stride in the direction of the\r\nmodern world. The Tertiary Era will, in the main, prove a fresh period\r\nof genial warmth and fertile low-lying regions. During its course our\r\ndeciduous trees and grasses will mingle with the palms and pines over\r\nthe land, our flowers will begin to brighten the landscape, and the\r\nforms of our familiar birds and mammals, even the form of man, will be\r\ndiscernible in the crowds of animals. At its close another mighty period\r\nof selection will clear the stage for its modern actors.\r\n\r\nA curious reflection is prompted in connection with this division of\r\nthe earth's story into periods of relative prosperity and quiescence,\r\nseparated by periods of disturbance. There was--on the most modest\r\nestimate--a stretch of some fifteen million years between the Cambrian\r\nand the Permian upheavals. On the same chronological scale the interval\r\nbetween the Permian and Cretaceous revolutions was only about seven\r\nmillion years, and the Tertiary Era will comprise only about three\r\nmillion years. One wonders if the Fourth (Quaternary) Era in which we\r\nlive will be similarly shortened. Further, whereas the earth returned\r\nafter each of the earlier upheavals to what seems to have been its\r\nprimitive condition of equable and warm climate, it has now entirely\r\ndeparted from that condition, and exhibits very different zones of\r\nclimate and a succession of seasons in the year. One wonders what the\r\nclimate of the earth will become long before the expiration of those ten\r\nmillion years which are usually assigned as the minimum period during\r\nwhich the globe will remain habitable.\r\n\r\nIt is premature to glance at the future, when we are still some millions\r\nof years from the present, but it will be useful to look more closely\r\nat the facts which inspire this reflection. From what we have seen,\r\nand shall further see, it is clear that, in spite of all the recent\r\ncontroversy about climate among our geologists, there has undeniably\r\nbeen a progressive refrigeration of the globe. Every geologist, indeed,\r\nadmits \"oscillations of climate,\" as Professor Chamberlin puts it.\r\nBut amidst all these oscillations we trace a steady lowering of\r\nthe temperature. Unless we put a strained and somewhat arbitrary\r\ninterpretation on the facts of the geological record, earlier ages knew\r\nnothing of our division of the year into pronounced seasons and of\r\nthe globe into very different climatic zones. It might plausibly be\r\nsuggested that we are still living in the last days of the Ice-Age,\r\nand that the earth may be slowly returning to a warmer condition.\r\nShackleton, it might be observed, found that there has been a\r\nconsiderable shrinkage of the south polar ice within the period of\r\nexploration. But we shall find that a difference of climate, as compared\r\nwith earlier ages, was already evident in the middle of the Tertiary\r\nEra, and it is far more noticeable to-day.\r\n\r\nWe do not know the causes of this climatic evolution--the point will be\r\nconsidered more closely in connection with the last Ice-Age--but we see\r\nthat it throws a flood of light on the evolution of organisms. It is\r\none of the chief incarnations of natural selection. Changes in the\r\ndistribution of land and water and in the nature of the land-surface,\r\nthe coming of powerful carnivores, and other agencies which we have\r\nseen, have had their share in the onward impulsion of life, but the most\r\ndrastic agency seems to have been the supervention of cold. The higher\r\ntypes of both animals and plants appear plainly in response to a\r\nlowering of temperature. This is the chief advantage of studying the\r\nstory of evolution in strict connection with the geological record. We\r\nshall find that the record will continue to throw light on our path to\r\nthe end, but, as we are now about to approach the most important era\r\nof evolution, and as we have now seen so much of the concrete story of\r\nevolution, it will be interesting to examine briefly some other ways of\r\nconceiving that story.\r\n\r\nWe need not return to the consideration of the leading schools of\r\nevolution, as described in a former chapter. Nothing that we have seen\r\nwill enable us to choose between the Lamarckian and the Weismannist\r\nhypothesis; and I doubt if anything we are yet to see will prove\r\nmore decisive. The dispute is somewhat academic, and not vital to a\r\nconception of evolution. We shall, for instance, presently follow the\r\nevolution of the horse, and see four of its toes shrink and disappear,\r\nwhile the fifth toe is enormously strengthened. In the facts themselves\r\nthere is nothing whatever to decide whether this evolution took place\r\non the lines suggested by Weismann, or on the lines suggested by Lamarck\r\nand accepted by Darwin. It will be enough for us merely to establish\r\nthe fact that the one-toed horse is an evolved descendant of a primitive\r\nfive-toed mammal, through the adaptation of its foot to running on firm\r\nground, its teeth and neck to feeding on grasses, and so on.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the facts we have already seen seem to justify the\r\nattitude of compromise I adopted in regard to the Mutationist theory. It\r\nwould be an advantage in many ways if we could believe that new species\r\narose by sudden and large variations (mutations) of the young from the\r\nparental type. In the case of many organs and habits it is extremely\r\ndifficult to see how a gradual development, by a slow accentuation of\r\nsmall variations, is possible. When we further find that experimenters\r\non living species can bring about such mutations, and when we reflect\r\nthat there must have been acute disturbances in the surroundings of\r\nanimals and plants sometimes, we are disposed to think that many a\r\nnew species may have arisen in this way. On the other hand, while\r\nthe palaeontological record can never prove that a species arose by\r\nmutations, it does sometimes show that species arise by very gradual\r\nmodification. The Chalk period, which we have just traversed, affords\r\na very clear instance. One of our chief investigators of the English\r\nChalk, Dr. Rowe, paid particular attention to the sea-urchins it\r\ncontains, as they serve well to identify different levels of chalk. He\r\ndiscovered, not merely that they vary from level to level, but that\r\nin at least one genus (Micraster) he could trace the organism very\r\ngradually passing from one species to another, without any leap or\r\nabruptness. It is certainly significant that we find such cases as this\r\nprecisely where the conditions of preservation are exceptionally good.\r\nWe must conclude that species arise, probably, both by mutations and\r\nsmall variations, and that it is impossible to say which class of\r\nspecies has been the more numerous.\r\n\r\nThere remain one or two conceptions of evolution which we have not\r\nhitherto noticed, as it was advisable to see the facts first. One of\r\nthese is the view--chiefly represented in this country by Professor\r\nHenslow--that natural selection has had no part in the creation of\r\nspecies; that the only two factors are the environment and the organism\r\nwhich responds to its changes. This is true enough in the sense that, as\r\nwe saw, natural selection is not an action of nature on the \"fit,\" but\r\non the unfit or less fit. But this does not in the least lessen the\r\nimportance of natural selection. If there were not in nature this body\r\nof destructive agencies, to which we apply the name natural selection,\r\nthere would be little--we cannot say no--evolution. But the rising\r\ncarnivores, the falls of temperature, etc., that we have studied, have\r\nhad so real, if indirect, an influence on the development of life that\r\nwe need not dwell on this.\r\n\r\nAnother school, or several schools, while admitting the action of\r\nnatural selection, maintain that earlier evolutionists have made nature\r\nmuch too red in tooth and claw. Dr. Russel Wallace from one motive, and\r\nPrince Krapotkin from another, have insisted that the triumphs of\r\nwar have been exaggerated, and the triumphs of peace, or of social\r\nco-operation, far too little appreciated. It will be found that such\r\nwriters usually base their theory on life as we find it in nature\r\nto-day, where the social principle is highly developed in many groups\r\nof animals. This is most misleading, since social co-operation among\r\nanimals, as an instrument of progress, is (geologically speaking) quite\r\na recent phenomenon. Nearly every group of animals in which it is found\r\nbelongs, to put it moderately, to the last tenth of the story of life,\r\nand in some of the chief instances the animals have only gradually\r\ndeveloped social life. [*] The first nine-tenths of the chronicle of\r\nevolution contain no indication of social life, except--curiously\r\nenough--in such groups as the Sponges, Corals, and Bryozoa, which are\r\namongst the least progressive in nature. We have seen plainly that\r\nduring the overwhelmingly greater part of the story of life the\r\npredominant agencies of evolution were struggle against adverse\r\nconditions and devouring carnivores; and we shall find them the\r\npredominant agencies throughout the Tertiary Era.\r\n\r\n     * Thus the social nature of man is sometimes quoted as one\r\n     of the chief causes of his development. It is true that it\r\n     has much to do with his later development, but we shall see\r\n     that the statement that man was from the start a social\r\n     being is not at all warranted by the facts. On the other\r\n     hand, it may be pointed out that the ants and termites had\r\n     appeared in the Mesozoic. We shall see some evidence that\r\n     the remarkable division of labour which now characterises\r\n     their life did not begin until a much later period, so that\r\n     we have no evidence of social life in the early stages.\r\n\r\n\r\nYet we must protest against the exaggerated estimate of the conscious\r\npain which so many read into these millions of years of struggle.\r\nProbably there was no consciousness at all during the greater part\r\nof the time. The wriggling of the worm on which you have accidentally\r\ntrodden is no proof whatever that you have caused conscious pain. The\r\nnervous system of an animal has been so evolved as to respond with great\r\ndisturbance of its tissue to any dangerous or injurious assault. It is\r\nthe selection of a certain means of self-preservation. But at what level\r\nof life the animal becomes conscious of this disturbance, and \"feels\r\npain,\" it is very difficult to determine. The subject is too vast to be\r\nopened here. In a special investigation of it. [*] I concluded that there is\r\nno proof of the presence of any degree of consciousness in the\r\ninvertebrate world even in the higher insects; that there is probably\r\nonly a dull, blurred, imperfect consciousness below the level of the\r\nhigher mammals and birds; and that even the consciousness of an ape is\r\nsomething very different from what educated Europeans, on the ground of\r\ntheir own experience, call consciousness. It is too often forgotten that\r\npain is in proportion to consciousness. We must beware of such fallacies\r\nas transferring our experience of pain to a Mesozoic reptile, with an\r\nounce or two of cerebrum to twenty tons of muscle and bone.\r\n\r\n     * \"The Evolution of Mind\" (Black), 1911.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne other view of evolution, which we find in some recent and reputable\r\nworks (such as Professor Geddes and Thomson's \"Evolution,\" 1911), calls\r\nfor consideration. In the ordinary Darwinian view the variations of the\r\nyoung from their parents are indefinite, and spread in all directions.\r\nThey may continue to occur for ages without any of them proving an\r\nadvantage to their possessors. Then the environment may change, and\r\na certain variation may prove an advantage, and be continuously and\r\nincreasingly selected. Thus these indefinite variations may be so\r\ncontrolled by the environment during millions of years that the fish at\r\nlast becomes an elephant or a man. The alternative view, urged by a few\r\nwriters, is that the variations were \"definitely directed.\" The phrase\r\nseems merely to complicate the story of evolution with a fresh and\r\nsuperfluous mystery. The nature and precise action of this \"definite\r\ndirection\" within the organism are quite unintelligible, and the facts\r\nseem explainable just as well--or not less imperfectly--without as with\r\nthis mystic agency. Radiolaria, Sponges, Corals, Sharks, Mudfishes,\r\nDuckbills, etc., do not change (except within the limits of their\r\nfamily) during millions of years, because they keep to an environment\r\nto which they are fitted. On the other hand, certain fishes, reptiles,\r\netc., remain in a changing environment, and they must change with it.\r\nThe process has its obscurities, but we make them darker, it seems to\r\nme, with these semi-metaphysical phrases.\r\n\r\nIt has seemed advisable to take this further glance at the general\r\nprinciples and current theories of evolution before we extend our own\r\nprocedure into the Tertiary Era. The highest types of animals and plants\r\nare now about to appear on the stage of the earth; the theatre itself is\r\nabout to take on a modern complexion. The Middle Ages are over; the new\r\nage is breaking upon the planet. We will, as before, first survey the\r\nTertiary Era as a whole, with the momentous changes it introduces, and\r\nthen examine, in separate chapters, the more important phases of its\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIt opens, like the preceding and the following era, with \"the area\r\nof land large and its relief pronounced.\" This is the outcome of the\r\nCretaceous revolution. Southern Europe and Southern Asia have risen, and\r\nshaken the last masses of the Chalk ocean from their faces; the whole\r\nwestern fringe of America has similarly emerged from the sea that had\r\nflooded it. In many parts, as in England (at that time a part of the\r\nContinent), there is so great a gap between the latest Cretaceous\r\nand the earliest Tertiary strata that these newly elevated lands must\r\nevidently have stood out of the waters for a prolonged period. On their\r\ncooler plains the tragedy of the extinction of the great reptiles comes\r\nto an end. The cyeads and ginkgoes have shrunk into thin survivors of\r\nthe luxuriant Mesozoic groves. The oak and beech and other deciduous\r\ntrees spread slowly over the successive lands, amid the glare and\r\nthunder of the numerous volcanoes which the disturbance of the crust has\r\nbrought into play. New forms of birds fly from tree to tree, or linger\r\nby the waters; and strange patriarchal types of mammals begin to move\r\namong the bones of the stricken reptiles.\r\n\r\nBut the seas and the rains and rivers are acting with renewed vigour\r\non the elevated lands, and the Eocene period closes in a fresh age of\r\nlevelling. Let us put the work of a million years or so in a sentence.\r\nThe southern sea, which has been confined almost to the limits of our\r\nMediterranean by the Cretaceous upheaval, gradually enlarges once more.\r\nIt floods the north-west of Africa almost as far as the equator; it\r\ncovers most of Italy, Turkey, Austria, and Southern Russia; it spreads\r\nover Asia Minor, Persia, and Southern Asia, until it joins the Pacific;\r\nand it sends a long arm across the Franco-British region, and up the\r\ngreat valley which is now the German Ocean.\r\n\r\nFrom earlier chapters we now expect to find a warmer climate, and the\r\nrecord gives abundant proof of it. To this period belongs the \"London\r\nClay,\" in whose thick and--to the unskilled eye--insignificant bed the\r\ngeologist reads the remarkable story of what London was two or three\r\nmillion years ago. It tells us that a sea, some 500 or 600 feet deep,\r\nthen lay over that part of England, and fragments of the life of the\r\nperiod are preserved in its deposit. The sea lay at the mouth of\r\na sub-tropical river on whose banks grew palms, figs, ginkgoes,\r\neucalyptuses, almonds, and magnolias, with the more familiar oaks and\r\npines and laurels. Sword-fishes and monstrous sharks lived in the sea.\r\nLarge turtles and crocodiles and enormous \"sea-serpents\" lingered\r\nin this last spell of warmth that Central Europe would experience.\r\nA primitive whale appeared in the seas, and strange large\r\ntapir-like mammals--remote ancestors of our horses and more familiar\r\nbeasts--wandered heavily on the land. Gigantic primitive birds,\r\nsometimes ten feet high, waded by the shore. Deposits of the period at\r\nBournemouth and in the Isle of Wight tell the same story of a land\r\nthat bore figs, vines, palms, araucarias, and aralias, and waters that\r\nsheltered turtles and crocodiles. The Parisian region presented the same\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nIn fact, one of the most characteristic traces of the southern sea which\r\nthen stretched from England to Africa in the south and India in the\r\neast indicates a warm climate. It will be remembered that the Cretaceous\r\nocean over Southern Europe had swarmed with the animalcules whose dead\r\nskeletons largely compose our chalk-beds. In the new southern ocean\r\nanother branch of these Thalamophores, the Nummulites, spreads with such\r\nportentous abundance that its shells--sometimes alone, generally with\r\nother material--make beds of solid limestone several thousand feet in\r\nthickness. The pyramids are built of this nummulitic limestone. The\r\none-celled animal in its shell is, however, no longer a microscopic\r\ngrain. It sometimes forms wonderful shells, an inch or more in diameter,\r\nin which as many as a thousand chambers succeed each other, in spiral\r\norder, from the centre. The beds containing it are found from the\r\nPyrenees to Japan.\r\n\r\nThat this vast warm ocean, stretching southward over a large part\r\nof what is now the Sahara, should give a semitropical aspect even to\r\nCentral Europe and Asia is not surprising. But this genial climate was\r\nstill very general over the earth. Evergreens which now need the warmth\r\nof Italy or the Riviera then flourished in Lapland and Spitzbergen.\r\nThe flora of Greenland--a flora that includes magnolias, figs, and\r\nbamboos--shows us that its temperature in the Eocene period must have\r\nbeen about 30 degrees higher than it is to-day. [*] The temperature of the\r\ncool Tyrol of modern Europe is calculated to have then been between 74\r\nand 81 degrees F. Palms, cactuses, aloes, gum-trees, cinnamon trees,\r\netc., flourished in the latitude of Northern France. The forests that\r\ncovered parts of Switzerland which are now buried in snow during a great\r\npart of the year were like the forests one finds in parts of India and\r\nAustralia to-day. The climate of North America, and of the land which\r\nstill connected it with Europe, was correspondingly genial.\r\n\r\n     * The great authority on Arctic geology, Heer, who makes\r\n     this calculation, puts this flora in the Miocene. It is now\r\n     usually considered that these warmer plants belong to the\r\n     earlier part of the Tertiary era.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis indulgent period (the Oligocene, or later part of the Eocene),\r\nscattering a rich and nutritious vegetation with great profusion over\r\nthe land, led to a notable expansion of animal life. Insects, birds, and\r\nmammals spread into vast and varied groups in every land. Had any of the\r\ngreat Mesozoic reptiles survived, the warmer age might have enabled them\r\nto dispute the sovereignty of the advancing mammals. But nothing more\r\nformidable than the turtle, the snake, and the crocodile (confined\r\nto the waters) had crossed the threshold of the Tertiary Era, and the\r\nmammals and birds had the full advantage of the new golden age. The\r\nfruits of the new trees, the grasses which now covered the plains, and\r\nthe insects which multiplied with the flowers afforded a magnificent\r\ndiet. The herbivorous mammals became a populous world, branching into\r\nnumerous different types according to their different environments.\r\nThe horse, the elephant, the camel, the pig, the deer, the rhinoceros\r\ngradually emerge out of the chaos of evolving forms. Behind them,\r\nhastening the course of their evolution, improving their speed, arms,\r\nand armour, is the inevitable carnivore. He, too, in the abundance of\r\nfood, grows into a vast population, and branches out toward familiar\r\ntypes. We will devote a chapter presently to this remarkable phase of\r\nthe story of evolution.\r\n\r\nBut the golden age closes, as all golden ages had done before it, and\r\nfor the same reason. The land begins to rise, and cast the warm shallow\r\nseas from its face. The expansion of life has been more rapid and\r\nremarkable than it had ever been before, in corresponding periods of\r\nabundant food and easy conditions; the contraction comes more quickly\r\nthan it had ever done before. Mountain masses begin to rise in nearly\r\nall parts of the world. The advance is slow and not continuous, but as\r\ntime goes on the Atlas, Alps, Pyrenees, Apennines, Caucasus, Himalaya,\r\nRocky Mountains, and Andes rise higher and higher. When the geologist\r\nlooks to-day for the floor of the Eocene ocean, which he recognises\r\nby the shells of the Nummulites, he finds it 10,000 feet above the\r\nsea-level in the Alps, 16,000 feet above the sea-level in the Himalaya,\r\nand 20,000 feet above the sea-level in Thibet. One need not ask why the\r\nregions of London and Paris fostered palms and magnolias and turtles in\r\nTertiary times, and shudder in their dreary winter to-day.\r\n\r\nThe Tertiary Era is divided by geologists into four periods: the\r\nEocene, Oligocene, Miocene, and Pliocene. \"Cene\" is our barbaric way of\r\nexpressing the Greek word for \"new,\" and the classification is meant\r\nto mark the increase of new (or modern and actual) types of life in\r\nthe course of the Tertiary Era. Many geologists, however, distrust\r\nthe classification, and are disposed to divide the Tertiary into two\r\nperiods. From our point of view, at least, it is advisable to do this.\r\nThe first and longer half of the Tertiary is the period in which the\r\ntemperature rises until Central Europe enjoys the climate of South\r\nAfrica; the second half is the period in which the land gradually\r\nrises, and the temperature falls, until glaciers and sheets of ice cover\r\nregions where the palm and fig had flourished.\r\n\r\nThe rise of the land had begun in the first half of the Tertiary, but\r\nhad been suspended. The Pyrenees and Apennines had begun to rise at\r\nthe end of the Eocene, straining the crust until it spluttered with\r\nvolcanoes, casting the nummulitic sea off large areas of Southern\r\nEurope. The Nummulites become smaller and less abundant. There is also\r\nsome upheaval in North America, and a bridge of land begins to\r\nconnect the north and south, and permit an effective mingling of their\r\npopulations. But the advance is, as I said, suspended, and the Oligocene\r\nperiod maintains the golden age. With the Miocene period the land\r\nresumes its rise. A chill is felt along the American coast, showing a\r\nfall in the temperature of the Atlantic. In Europe there is a similar\r\nchill, and a more obvious reason for it. There is an ascending movement\r\nof the whole series of mountains from Morocco and the Pyrenees, through\r\nthe Alps, the Caucasus, and the Carpathians, to India and China. Large\r\nlakes still lie over Western Europe, but nearly the whole of it emerges\r\nfrom the ocean. The Mediterranean still sends an arm up France, and with\r\nanother arm encircles the Alpine mass; but the upheaval continues, and\r\nthe great nummulitic sea is reduced to a series of extensive lakes, cut\r\noff both from the Atlantic and Pacific. The climate of Southern Europe\r\nis probably still as genial as that of the Canaries to-day. Palms still\r\nlinger in the landscape in reduced numbers.\r\n\r\nThe last part of the Tertiary, the Pliocene, opens with a slight return\r\nof the sea. The upheaval is once more suspended, and the waters\r\nare eating into the land. There is some foundering of land at the\r\nsouth-western tip of Europe; the \"Straits of Gibraltar\" begin to connect\r\nthe Mediterranean with the Atlantic, and the Balearic Islands, Corsica,\r\nand Sardinia remain as the mountain summits of a submerged land. Then\r\nthe upheaval is resumed, in nearly every part of the earth.\r\n\r\nNearly every great mountain chain that the geologist has studied\r\nshared in this remarkable movement at the end of the Tertiary Era. The\r\nPyrenees, Alps, Himalaya, etc., made their last ascent, and attained\r\ntheir present elevation. And as the land rose, the aspect of Europe\r\nand America slowly altered. The palms, figs, bamboos, and magnolias\r\ndisappeared; the turtles, crocodiles, flamingoes, and hippopotamuses\r\nretreated toward the equator. The snow began to gather thick on the\r\nrising heights; then the glaciers began to glitter on their flanks. As\r\nthe cold increased, the rivers of ice which flowed down the hills\r\nof Switzerland, Spain, Scotland, or Scandinavia advanced farther and\r\nfarther over the plains. The regions of green vegetation shrank before\r\nthe oncoming ice, the animals retreated south, or developed Arctic\r\nfeatures. Europe and America were ushering in the great Ice-Age, which\r\nwas to bury five or six million square miles of their territory under a\r\nthick mantle of ice.\r\n\r\nSuch is the general outline of the story of the Tertiary Era. We\r\napproach the study of its types of life and their remarkable development\r\nmore intelligently when we have first given careful attention to this\r\nextraordinary series of physical changes. Short as the Era is, compared\r\nwith its predecessors, it is even more eventful and stimulating than\r\nthey, and closes with what Professor Chamberlin calls \"the greatest\r\ndeformative movements in post-Cambrian history.\" In the main it has,\r\nfrom the evolutionary point of view, the same significant character\r\nas the two preceding eras. Its middle portion is an age of expansion,\r\nindulgence, exuberance, in which myriads of varied forms are thrown upon\r\nthe scene, its later part is an age of contraction, of annihilation,\r\nof drastic test, in which the more effectively organised will be chosen\r\nfrom the myriads of types. Once more nature has engendered a vast brood,\r\nand is about to select some of her offspring to people the modern world.\r\nAmong the types selected will be Man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. THE FLOWER AND THE INSECT\r\n\r\nAS we approach the last part of the geological record we must neglect\r\nthe lower types of life, which have hitherto occupied so much of\r\nour attention, so that we may inquire more fully into the origin and\r\nfortunes of the higher forms which now fill the stage. It may be noted,\r\nin general terms, that they shared the opulence of the mid-Tertiary\r\nperiod, produced some gigantic specimens of their respective families,\r\nand evolved into the genera, and often the species, which we find living\r\nto-day. A few illustrations will suffice to give some idea of the later\r\ndevelopment of the lower invertebrates and vertebrates.\r\n\r\nMonstrous oysters bear witness to the prosperity of that ancient and\r\ninteresting family of the Molluscs. In some species the shells were\r\ncommonly ten inches long; the double shell of one of these Tertiary\r\nbivalves has been found which measured thirteen inches in length, eight\r\nin width, and six in thickness. In the higher branch of the Mollusc\r\nworld the naked Cephalopods (cuttle-fish, etc.) predominate over the\r\nnautiloids--the shrunken survivors of the great coiled-shell race. Among\r\nthe sharks, the modern Squalodonts entirely displace the older types,\r\nand grow to an enormous size. Some of the teeth we find in Tertiary\r\ndeposits are more than six inches long and six inches broad at the base.\r\nThis is three times the size of the teeth of the largest living shark,\r\nand it is therefore believed that the extinct possessor of these\r\nformidable teeth (Carcharodon megalodon) must have been much more than\r\nfifty, and was possibly a hundred, feet in length. He flourished in\r\nthe waters of both Europe and America during the halcyon days of the\r\nTertiary Era. Among the bony fishes, all our modern and familiar types\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nThe amphibia and reptiles also pass into their modern types, after a\r\nperiod of generous expansion. Primitive frogs and toads make their first\r\nappearance in the Tertiary, and the remains are found in European beds\r\nof four-foot-long salamanders. More than fifty species of Tertiary\r\nturtles are known, and many of them were of enormous size. One carapace\r\nthat has been found in a Tertiary bed measures twelve feet in length,\r\neight feet in width, and seven feet in height to the top of the back.\r\nThe living turtle must have been nearly twenty feet long. Marine\r\nreptiles, of a snake-like structure, ran to fifteen feet in length.\r\nCrocodiles and alligators swarmed in the rivers of Europe until the\r\nchilly Pliocene bade them depart to Africa.\r\n\r\nIn a word, it was the seven years of plenty for the whole living world,\r\nand the expansive development gave birth to the modern types, which were\r\nto be selected from the crowd in the subsequent seven years of famine.\r\nWe must be content to follow the evolution of the higher types of\r\norganisms. I will therefore first describe the advance of the Tertiary\r\nvegetation, the luxuriance of which was the first condition of the great\r\nexpansion of animal life; then we will glance at the grand army of\r\nthe insects which followed the development of the flowers, and at the\r\naccompanying expansion and ramification of the birds. The long and\r\ninteresting story of the mammals must be told in a separate chapter,\r\nand a further chapter must be devoted to the appearance of the human\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nWe saw that the Angiosperms, or flowering plants, appeared at the\r\nbeginning of the Cretaceous period, and were richly developed before the\r\nTertiary Era opened. We saw also that their precise origin is unknown.\r\nThey suddenly invade a part of North America where there were conditions\r\nfor preserving some traces of them, but we have as yet no remains\r\nof their early forms or clue to their place of development. We may\r\nconjecture that their ancestors had been living in some elevated inland\r\nregion during the warmth of the Jurassic period.\r\n\r\nAs it is now known that many of the cycad-like Mesozoic plants bore\r\nflowers--as the modern botanist scarcely hesitates to call them--the\r\ngap between the Gymnosperms and Angiosperms is very much lessened. There\r\nare, however, structural differences which forbid us to regard any of\r\nthese flowering cycads, which we have yet found, as the ancestors of the\r\nAngiosperms. The most reasonable view seems to be that a small and local\r\nbranch of these primitive flowering plants was evolved, like the rest,\r\nin the stress of the Permian-Triassic cold; that, instead of descending\r\nto the warm moist levels with the rest at the end of the Triassic, and\r\ndeveloping the definite characters of the cycad, it remained on the\r\nhigher and cooler land; and that the rise of land at the end of the\r\nJurassic period stimulated the development of its Angiosperm features,\r\nenlarged the area in which it was especially fitted to thrive, and so\r\npermitted it to spread and suddenly break into the geological record as\r\na fully developed Angiosperm.\r\n\r\nAs the cycads shrank in the Cretaceous period, the Angiosperms deployed\r\nwith great rapidity, and, spreading at various levels and in different\r\nkinds of soils and climates, branched into hundreds of different types.\r\nWe saw that the oak, beech, elm, maple, palm, grass, etc., were well\r\ndeveloped before the end of the Cretaceous period. The botanist divides\r\nthe Angiosperms into two leading groups, the Monocotyledons (palms,\r\ngrasses, lilies, orchises, irises, etc.) and Dicotyledons (the vast\r\nmajority), and it is now generally believed that the former were\r\ndeveloped from an early and primitive branch of the latter. But it is\r\nimpossible to retrace the lines of development of the innumerable types\r\nof Angiosperms. The geologist has mainly to rely on a few stray leaves\r\nthat were swept into the lakes and preserved in the mud, and the\r\nevidence they afford is far too slender for the construction of\r\ngenealogical trees. The student of living plants can go a little\r\nfurther in discovering relationships, and, when we find him tracing such\r\napparently remote plants as the apple and the strawberry to a common\r\nancestor with the rose, we foresee interesting possibilities on the\r\nbotanical side. But the evolution of the Angiosperms is a recent and\r\nimmature study, and we will be content with a few reflections on the\r\nstruggle of the various types of trees in the changing conditions of\r\nthe Tertiary, the development of the grasses, and the evolution of\r\nthe flower. In other words, we will be content to ask how the modern\r\nlandscape obtained its general vegetal features.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, the vegetation of the first part of the Tertiary Era\r\nwas a mixture of sub-tropical and temperate forms, a confused mass of\r\nFerns, Conifers, Ginkgoales, Monocotyledons, and Dicotyledons. Here is\r\na casual list of plants that then grew in the latitude of London and\r\nParis: the palm, magnolia, myrtle, Banksia, vine, fig, aralea, sequoia,\r\neucalyptus, cinnamon tree, cactus, agave, tulip tree, apple, plum,\r\nbamboo, almond, plane, maple, willow, oak, evergreen oak, laurel, beech,\r\ncedar, etc. The landscape must have been extraordinarily varied and\r\nbeautiful and rich. To one botanist it suggests Malaysia, to another\r\nIndia, to another Australia.\r\n\r\nIt is really the last gathering of the plants, before the great\r\ndispersion. Then the cold creeps slowly down from the Arctic regions,\r\nand begins to reduce the variety. We can clearly trace its gradual\r\nadvance. In the Carboniferous and Jurassic the vegetation of the Arctic\r\nregions had been the same as that of England; in the Eocene palms can\r\nflourish in England, but not further north; in the Pliocene the palms\r\nand bamboos and semi-tropical species are driven out of Europe; in the\r\nPleistocene the ice-sheet advances to the valleys of the Thames and the\r\nDanube (and proportionately in the United States), every warmth-loving\r\nspecies is annihilated, and our grasses, oaks, beeches, elms, apples,\r\nplums, etc., linger on the green southern fringe of the Continent, and\r\nin a few uncovered regions, ready to spread north once more as the ice\r\ncreeps back towards the Alps or the Arctic circle. Thus, in few words,\r\ndid Europe and North America come to have the vegetation we find in them\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nThe next broad characteristic of our landscape is the spreading carpet\r\nof grass. The interest of the evolution of the grasses will be seen\r\nlater, when we shall find the evolution of the horse, for instance,\r\nfollowing very closely upon it. So striking, indeed, is the connection\r\nbetween the advance of the grasses and the advance of the mammals that\r\nDr. Russel Wallace has recently claimed (\"The World of Life,\" 1910)\r\nthat there is a clear purposive arrangement in the whole chain of\r\ndevelopments which leads to the appearance of the grasses. He says that\r\n\"the very puzzling facts\" of the immense reptilian development in\r\nthe Mesozoic can only be understood on the supposition that they were\r\nevolved \"to keep down the coarser vegetation, to supply animal food for\r\nthe larger Carnivora, and thus give time for higher forms to obtain a\r\nsecure foothold and a sufficient amount of varied form and structure\"\r\n(p. 284).\r\n\r\nEvery insistence on the close connection of the different strands in the\r\nweb of life is welcome, but Dr. Wallace does not seem to have learned\r\nthe facts accurately. There is nothing \"puzzling\" about the Mesozoic\r\nreptilian development; the depression of the land, the moist warmth,\r\nand the luscious vegetation of the later Triassic and the Jurassic\r\namply explain it. Again, the only carnivores to whom they seem to have\r\nsupplied food were reptiles of their own race. Nor can the feeding of\r\nthe herbivorous reptiles be connected with the rise of the Angiosperms.\r\nWe do not find the flowering plants developing anywhere in those vast\r\nregions where the great reptiles abounded; they invade them from some\r\nsingle unknown region, and mingle with the pines and ginkgoes, while the\r\ncyeads alone are destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe grasses, in particular, do not appear until the Cretaceous, and do\r\nnot show much development until the mid-Tertiary; and their development\r\nseems to be chiefly connected with physical conditions. The meandering\r\nrivers and broad lakes of the mid-Tertiary would have their fringes\r\nof grass and sedge, and, as the lakes dried up in the vicissitudes of\r\nclimate, large areas of grass would be left on their sites. To these\r\nprimitive prairies the mammal (not reptile) herbivores would be\r\nattracted, with important results. The consequences to the animals\r\nwe will consider presently. The effect on the grasses may be well\r\nunderstood on the lines so usefully indicated in Dr. Wallace's book. The\r\nincessant cropping, age after age, would check the growth of the larger\r\nand coarser grasses give opportunity to the smaller and finer, and lead\r\nin time to the development of the grassy plains of the modern world.\r\nThus one more familiar feature was added to the landscape in the\r\nTertiary Era.\r\n\r\nAs this fresh green carpet spread over the formerly naked plains,\r\nit began to be enriched with our coloured flowers. There were large\r\nflowers, we saw, on some of the Mesozoic cycads, but their sober yellows\r\nand greens--to judge from their descendants--would do little to brighten\r\nthe landscape. It is in the course of the Tertiary Era that the mantle\r\nof green begins to be embroidered with the brilliant hues of our\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nGrant Allen put forward in 1882 (\"The Colours of Flowers\") an\r\ninteresting theory of the appearance of the colours of flowers, and it\r\nis regarded as probable. He observed that most of the simplest flowers\r\nare yellow; the more advanced flowers of simple families, and the\r\nsimpler flowers of slightly advanced families, are generally white or\r\npink; the most advanced flowers of all families, and almost all the\r\nflowers of the more advanced families, are red, purple, or blue; and the\r\nmost advanced flowers of the most advanced families are always\r\neither blue or variegated. Professor Henslow adds a number of equally\r\nsignificant facts with the same tendency, so that we have strong reason\r\nto conceive the floral world as passing through successive phases of\r\ncolour in the Tertiary Era. At first it would be a world of yellows\r\nand greens, like that of the Mesozoic vegetation, but brighter. In time\r\nsplashes of red and white would lie on the face of the landscape; and\r\nlater would come the purples, the rich blues, and the variegated colours\r\nof the more advanced flowers.\r\n\r\nWhy the colours came at all is a question closely connected with the\r\ngeneral story of the evolution of the flower, at which we must glance.\r\nThe essential characteristic of the flower, in the botanist's judgment,\r\nis the central green organ which you find--say, in a lily--standing out\r\nin the middle of the floral structure, with a number of yellow-coated\r\nrods round it. The yellow rods bear the male germinal elements (pollen);\r\nthe central pistil encloses the ovules, or female elements. \"Angiosperm\"\r\nmeans \"covered-seed plant,\" and its characteristic is this protection\r\nof the ovules within a special chamber, to which the pollen alone may\r\npenetrate. Round these essential organs are the coloured petals of the\r\ncorolla (the chief part of the flower to the unscientific mind) and the\r\nsepals, often also coloured, of the calyx.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that all these parts arose from modifications of the\r\nleaves or stems of the primitive plant; though whether the bright\r\nleaves of the corolla are directly derived from ordinary leaves, or are\r\nenlarged and flattened stamens, has been disputed. And to the question\r\nwhy these bright petals, whose colour and variety of form lend such\r\ncharm to the world of flowers, have been developed at all, most\r\nbotanists will give a prompt and very interesting reply. As both male\r\nand female elements are usually in one flower, it may fertilise itself,\r\nthe pollen falling directly on the pistil. But fertilisation is more\r\nsure and effective if the pollen comes from a different individual--if\r\nthere is \"cross fertilisation.\" This may be accomplished by the simple\r\nagency of the wind blowing the pollen broadcast, but it is done much\r\nbetter by insects, which brush against the stamens, and carry grains of\r\nthe pollen to the next flower they visit.\r\n\r\nWe have here a very fertile line of development among the primitive\r\nflowers. The insects begin to visit them, for their pollen or juices,\r\nand cross-fertilise them. If this is an advantage, attractiveness to\r\ninsects will become so important a feature that natural selection will\r\ndevelop it more and more. In plain English, what is meant is that those\r\nflowers which are more attractive to insects will be the most surely\r\nfertilised and breed most, and the prolonged application of this\r\nprinciple during hundreds of thousands of years will issue in the\r\nimmense variety of our flowers. They will be enriched with little stores\r\nof honey and nectar; not so mysterious an advantage, when we reflect on\r\nthe concentration of the juices in the neighbourhood of the seed. Then\r\nthey must \"advertise\" their stores, and the strong perfumes and bright\r\ncolours begin to develop, and ensure posterity to their possessors. The\r\nshape of the corolla will be altered in hundreds of ways, to accommodate\r\nand attract the useful visitor and shut out the mere robber. These\r\nutilities, together with the various modifying agencies of different\r\nenvironments, are generally believed to have led to the bewildering\r\nvariety and great beauty of our floral world.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to add that this view has been sharply challenged by a\r\nnumber of recent writers. It is questioned if colours and scents do\r\nattract insects; though several recent series of experiments seem to\r\nshow that bees are certainly attracted by colours. It is questioned if\r\ncross-fertilisation has really the importance ascribed to it since the\r\ndays of Darwin. Some of these writers believe that the colours and the\r\npeculiar shape which the petals take in some flowers (orchises, for\r\ninstance) have been evolved to deter browsing animals from eating them.\r\nThe theory is thus only a different application of natural selection;\r\nProfessor Henslow, on the other hand, stands alone in denying the\r\nselection, and believing that the insects directly developed the scents,\r\nhoneys, colours, and shapes by mechanical irritation. The great majority\r\nof botanists adhere to the older view, and see in the wonderful Tertiary\r\nexpansion of the flowers a manifold adaptation to the insect friends and\r\ninsect foes which then became very abundant and varied.\r\n\r\nResisting the temptation to glance at the marvellous adaptations\r\nwhich we find to-day in our plant world--the insect-eating plants, the\r\nclimbers, the parasites, the sensitive plants, the water-storing plants\r\nin dry regions, and so on--we must turn to the consideration of the\r\ninsects themselves. We have already studied the evolution of the insect\r\nin general, and seen its earlier forms. The Tertiary Era not only\r\nwitnessed a great deployment of the insects, but was singularly rich in\r\nmeans of preserving them. The \"fly in amber\" has ceased to be a puzzle\r\neven to the inexpert. Amber is the resin that exuded from pine-like\r\ntrees, especially in the Baltic region, in the Eocene and Oligocene\r\nperiods. Insects stuck in the resin, and were buried under fresh layers\r\nof it, and we find them embalmed in it as we pick up the resin on the\r\nshores of the Baltic to-day. The Tertiary lakes were also important\r\ncemeteries of insects. A great bed at Florissart, in Colorado, is\r\ndescribed by one of the American experts who examined it as \"a Tertiary\r\nPompeii.\" It has yielded specimens of about a thousand species of\r\nTertiary insects. Near the large ancient lake, of which it marks the\r\nsite, was a volcano, and the fine ash yielded from the cone seems to\r\nhave buried myriads of insects in the water. At Oeningen a similar\r\nlake-deposit has, although only a few feet thick, yielded 900 species of\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nYet these rich and numerous finds throw little light on the evolution of\r\nthe insect, except in the general sense that they show species and even\r\ngenera quite different from those of to-day. No new families of insects\r\nhave appeared since the Eocene, and the ancient types had by that time\r\ndisappeared. Since the Eocene, however, the species have been almost\r\nentirely changed, so that the insect record, from its commencement\r\nin the Primary Era, has the stamp of evolution on every page of it.\r\nUnfortunately, insects, especially the higher and later insects,\r\nare such frail structures that they are only preserved in very rare\r\nconditions. The most important event of the insect-world in the Tertiary\r\nis the arrival of the butterflies, which then appear for the first time.\r\nWe may assume that they spread with great rapidity and abundance in\r\nthe rich floral world of the mid-Jurassic. More than 13,000 species of\r\nLepidoptera are known to-day, and there are probably twice that number\r\nyet to be classified by the entomologist. But so far the Tertiary\r\ndeposits have yielded only the fragmentary remains of about twenty\r\nindividual butterflies.\r\n\r\nThe evolutionary study of the insects is, therefore, not so much\r\nconcerned with the various modifications of the three pairs of jaws,\r\ninherited from the primitive Tracheate, and the wings, which have\r\ngiven us our vast variety of species. It is directed rather to the more\r\ninteresting questions of what are called the \"instincts\" of the insects,\r\nthe remarkable metamorphosis by which the young of the higher orders\r\nattain the adult form, and the extraordinary colouring and marking of\r\nbees, wasps, and butterflies. Even these questions, however, are so\r\nlarge that only a few words can be said here on the tendencies of recent\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the psychic powers of insects it may be said, in the\r\nfirst place, that it is seriously disputed among the modern authorities\r\nwhether even the highest insects (the ant, bee, and wasp) have any\r\ndegree whatever of the intelligence which an earlier generation\r\ngenerously bestowed on them. Wasmann and Bethe, two of the leading\r\nauthorities on ants, take the negative view; Forel claims that they show\r\noccasional traces of intelligence. It is at all events clear that the\r\nenormous majority of, if not all, their activities--and especially\r\nthose activities of the ant and the bee which chiefly impress the\r\nimagination--are not intelligent, but instinctive actions. And the\r\nsecond point to be noted is that the word \"instinct,\" in the old sense\r\nof some innate power or faculty directing the life of an animal, has\r\nbeen struck out of the modern scientific dictionary. The ant or bee\r\ninherits a certain mechanism of nerves and muscles which will, in\r\ncertain circumstances, act in the way we call \"instinctive.\" The problem\r\nis to find how this mechanism and its remarkable actions were slowly\r\nevolved.\r\n\r\nIn view of the innumerable and infinitely varied forms of \"instinct\"\r\nin the insect world we must restrict ourselves to a single\r\nillustration--say, the social life of the ants and the bees. We are not\r\nwithout indications of the gradual development of this social life. In\r\nthe case of the ant we find that the Tertiary specimens--and about a\r\nhundred species are found in Switzerland alone, whereas there are only\r\nfifty species in the whole of Europe to-day--all have wings and are,\r\napparently, of the two sexes, not neutral. This seems to indicate\r\nthat even in the mid-Tertiary some millions of years after the first\r\nappearance of the ant, the social life which we admire in the ants today\r\nhad not yet been developed. The Tertiary bees, on the other hand, are\r\nsaid to show some traces of the division of labour (and modification\r\nof structure) which make the bees so interesting; but in this case the\r\nliving bees, rising from a solitary life through increasing stages of\r\nsocial co-operation, give us some idea of the gradual development of\r\nthis remarkable citizenship.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the great selective agency which has brought about\r\nthese, and many other remarkable activities of the insects (such as the\r\nstoring of food with their eggs by wasps), was probably the occurrence\r\nof periods of cold, and especially the beginning of a winter season in\r\nthe Cretaceous or Tertiary age. In the periods of luxuriant life (the\r\nCarboniferous, the Jurassic, or the Oligocene), when insects swarmed and\r\nvaried in every direction, some would vary in the direction of a more\r\neffective placing of the eggs; and the supervening period of cold and\r\nscarcity would favour them. When a regular winter season set in, this\r\ntendency would be enormously increased. It is a parallel case to the\r\nevolution of the birds and mammals from the reptiles. Those that varied\r\nmost in the direction of care for the egg and the young would have the\r\nlargest share in the next generation. When we further reflect that since\r\nthe Tertiary the insect world has passed through the drastic disturbance\r\nof the climate in the great Ice-Age, we seem to have an illuminating\r\nclue to one of the most remarkable features of higher insect life.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the colour marks' and patterns on so many of the higher\r\ninsects, with which we may join the origin of the stick-insects,\r\nleaf-insects, etc., is a subject of lively controversy in science\r\nto-day. The protective value of the appearance of insects which\r\nlook almost exactly like dried twigs or decaying leaves, and of an\r\narrangement of the colours of the wings of butterflies which makes them\r\nalmost invisible when at rest, is so obvious that natural selection was\r\nconfidently invoked to explain them. In other cases certain colours\r\nor marks seemed to have a value as \"warning colours,\" advertising the\r\nnauseousness of their possessors to the bird, which had learned to\r\nrecognise them; in other cases these colours and marks seemed to be\r\nborrowed by palatable species, whose unconscious \"mimicry\" led to their\r\nsurvival; in other cases, again, the patterns and spots were regarded as\r\n\"recognition marks,\" by which the male could find his mate.\r\n\r\nScience is just now passing through a phase of acute criticism--as\r\nthe reader will have realised by this time--and many of the positions\r\nconfidently adopted in the earlier constructive stage are challenged.\r\nThis applies to the protective colours, warning colours, mimicry, etc.,\r\nof insects. Probably some of the affirmations of the older generation of\r\nevolutionists were too rigid and extensive; and probably the denials of\r\nthe new generation are equally exaggerated. When all sound criticism has\r\nbeen met, there remains a vast amount of protective colouring, shaping,\r\nand marking in the insect world of which natural selection gives us the\r\none plausible explanation. But the doctrine of natural selection does\r\nnot mean that every feature of an animal shall have a certain utility.\r\nIt will destroy animals with injurious variations and favour animals\r\nwith useful variations; but there may be a large amount of variation,\r\nespecially in colour, to which it is quite indifferent. In this way much\r\ncolour-marking may develop, either from ordinary embryonic variations\r\nor (as experiment on butterflies shows) from the direct influence of\r\nsurroundings which has no vital significance. In this way, too, small\r\nvariations of no selective value may gradually increase until they\r\nchance to have a value to the animal. [*]\r\n\r\n     * For a strong statement of the new critical position see\r\n     Dewar and Finn's \"Making of Species,\" 1909, ch. vi.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origin of the metamorphosis, or pupa-stage, of the higher\r\ninsects, with all its wonderful protective devices, is so obscure and\r\ncontroverted that we must pass over it. Some authorities think that\r\nthe sleep-stage has been evolved for the protection of the helpless\r\ntransforming insect; some believe that it occurs because movement would\r\nbe injurious to the insect in that stage; some say that the muscular\r\nsystem is actually dissolved in its connections; and some recent experts\r\nsuggest that it is a reminiscence of the fact that the ancestors of the\r\nmetamorphosing insects were addicted to internal parasitism in their\r\nyouth. It is one of the problems of the future. At present we have no\r\nfossil pupa-remains (though we have one caterpillar) to guide us. We\r\nmust leave these fascinating but difficult problems of insect life, and\r\nglance at the evolution of the birds.\r\n\r\nTo the student of nature whose interest is confined to one branch\r\nof science the record of life is a mysterious Succession of waves. A\r\ncomprehensive view of nature, living and non-living, past and present,\r\ndiscovers scores of illuminating connections, and even sees at times\r\nthe inevitable sequence of events. Thus if the rise of the Angiospermous\r\nvegetation on the ruins of the Mesozoic world is understood in the light\r\nof geological and climatic changes, and the consequent deploying of\r\nthe insects, especially the suctorial insects, is a natural result, the\r\nsimultaneous triumph of the birds is not unintelligible. The grains\r\nand fruits of the Angiosperms and the vast swarms of insects provided\r\nimmense stores of food; the annihilation of the Pterosaurs left a whole\r\nstratum of the earth free for their occupation.\r\n\r\nWe saw that a primitive bird, with very striking reptilian features, was\r\nfound in the Jurassic rocks, suggesting very clearly the evolution of\r\nthe bird from the reptile in the cold of the Permian or Triassic period.\r\nIn the Cretaceous we found the birds distributed in a number of genera,\r\nbut of two leading types. The Ichthyornis type was a tern-like flying\r\nbird, with socketed teeth and biconcave vertebrae like the reptile, but\r\notherwise fully evolved into a bird. Its line is believed to survive in\r\nthe gannets, cormorants, pelicans, and frigate-birds of to-day. The less\r\nnumerous Hesperornis group were large and powerful divers. Then there\r\nis a blank in the record, representing the Cretaceous upheaval, and it\r\nunfortunately conceals the first great ramification of the bird world.\r\nWhen the light falls again on the Eocene period we find great numbers\r\nof our familiar types quite developed. Primitive types of gulls, herons,\r\npelicans, quails, ibises, flamingoes, albatrosses, buzzards, hornbills,\r\nfalcons, eagles, owls, plovers, and woodcocks are found in the Eocene\r\nbeds; the Oligocene beds add parrots, trogons, cranes, marabouts,\r\nsecretary-birds, grouse, swallows, and woodpeckers. We cannot suppose\r\nthat every type has been preserved, but we see that our bird-world was\r\nvirtually created in the early part of the Tertiary Era.\r\n\r\nWith these more or less familiar types were large ostrich-like survivors\r\nof the older order. In the bed of the sea which covered the site\r\nof London in the Eocene are found the remains of a toothed bird\r\n(Odontopteryx), though the teeth are merely sharp outgrowths of the\r\nedge of the bill. Another bird of the same period and region (Gastornis)\r\nstood about ten feet high, and must have looked something like a wading\r\nostrich. Other large waders, even more ostrich-like in structure, lived\r\nin North America; and in Patagonia the remains have been found of a\r\nmassive bird, about eight feet high, with a head larger than that of\r\nany living animal except the elephant, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus\r\n(Chamberlin).\r\n\r\nThe absence of early Eocene remains prevents us from tracing the lines\r\nof our vast and varied bird-kingdom to their Mesozoic beginnings.\r\nAnd when we appeal to the zoologist to supply the missing links of\r\nrelationship, by a comparison of the structures of living birds, we\r\nreceive only uncertain and very general suggestions. [*] He tells us that\r\nthe ostrich-group (especially the emus and cassowaries) are one of the\r\nmost primitive stocks of the bird world, and that the ancient Dinornis\r\ngroup and the recently extinct moas seem to be offshoots of that stock.\r\nThe remaining many thousand species of Carinate birds (or flying birds\r\nwith a keel [carina]-shaped breast-bone for the attachment of the flying\r\nmuscles) are then gathered into two great branches, which are \"traceable\r\nto a common stock\" (Pycraft), and branch in their turn along the later\r\nlines of development. One of these lines--the pelicans, cormorants,\r\netc.--seems to be a continuation of the Ichthyornis type of the\r\nCretaceous, with the Odontopteryx as an Eocene offshoot; the divers,\r\npenguins, grebes, and petrels represent another ancient stock, which\r\nmay be related to the Hesperornis group of the Cretaceous. Dr. Chalmers\r\nMitchell thinks that the \"screamers\" of South America are the nearest\r\nrepresentatives of the common ancestor of the keel-breasted birds. But\r\neven to give the broader divisions of the 19,000 species of living birds\r\nwould be of little interest to the general reader.\r\n\r\n     * The best treatment of the subject will be found in W. P.\r\n     Pycraft's History of Birds, 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe special problems of bird-evolution are as numerous and unsettled\r\nas those of the insects. There is the same dispute as to \"protective\r\ncolours\" and \"recognition marks\", the same uncertainty as to the origin\r\nof such instinctive practices as migration and nesting. The general\r\nfeeling is that the annual migration had its origin in the overcrowding\r\nof the regions in which birds could live all the year round. They\r\ntherefore pushed northward in the spring and remained north until the\r\nwinter impoverishment drove them south again. On this view each group\r\nwould be returning to its ancestral home, led by the older birds, in the\r\ngreat migration flights. The curious paths they follow are believed by\r\nsome authorities to mark the original lines of their spread, preserved\r\nfrom generation to generation through the annual lead of the older\r\nbirds. If we recollect the Ice-Age which drove the vast majority of the\r\nbirds south at the end of the Tertiary, and imagine them later following\r\nthe northward retreat of the ice, from their narrowed and overcrowded\r\nsouthern territory, we may not be far from the secret of the annual\r\nmigration.\r\n\r\nA more important controversy is conducted in regard to the gorgeous\r\nplumage and other decorations and weapons of the male birds. Darwin, as\r\nis known, advanced a theory of \"sexual selection\" to explain these.\r\nThe male peacock, to take a concrete instance, would have developed its\r\nbeautiful tail because, through tens of thousands of generations, the\r\nfemale selected the more finely tailed male among the various suitors.\r\nDr. Wallace and other authorities always disputed this aesthetic\r\nsentiment and choice on the part of the female. The general opinion\r\ntoday is that Darwin's theory could not be sustained in the range and\r\nprecise sense he gave to it. Some kind of display by the male in the\r\nbreeding season would be an advantage, but to suppose that the females\r\nof any species of birds or mammals had the definite and uniform taste\r\nnecessary for the creation of male characters by sexual selection is\r\nmore than difficult. They seem to be connected in origin rather with the\r\nhigher vitality of the male, but the lines on which they were selected\r\nare not yet understood.\r\n\r\nThis general sketch of the enrichment of the earth with flowering\r\nplants, insects, and birds in the Tertiary Era is all that the limits of\r\nthe present work permit us to give. It is an age of exuberant life\r\nand abundant food; the teeming populations overflow their primitive\r\nboundaries, and, in adapting themselves to every form of diet, every\r\nphase of environment, and every device of capture or escape, the\r\nspreading organisms are moulded into tens of thousands of species. We\r\nshall see this more clearly in the evolution of the mammals. What we\r\nchiefly learn from the present chapter is the vital interconnection of\r\nthe various parts of nature. Geological changes favour the spread of\r\na certain type of vegetation. Insects are attracted to its nutritious\r\nseed-organs, and an age of this form of parasitism leads to a signal\r\nmodification of the jaws of the insects themselves and to the lavish\r\nvariety and brilliance of the flowers. Birds are attracted to the\r\nnutritious matter enclosing the seeds, and, as it is an advantage to the\r\nplant that its seeds be scattered beyond the already populated area, by\r\npassing through the alimentary canal of the bird, and being discharged\r\nwith its excrements, a fresh line of evolution leads to the appearance\r\nof the large and coloured fruits. The birds, again, turn upon the\r\nswarming insects, and the steady selection they exercise leads to\r\nthe zigzag flight and the protective colour of the butterfly, the\r\nconcealment of the grub and the pupa, the marking of the caterpillar,\r\nand so on. We can understand the living nature of to-day as the outcome\r\nof that teeming, striving, changing world of the Tertiary Era, just as\r\nit in turn was the natural outcome of the ages that had gone before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. THE ORIGIN OF OUR MAMMALS\r\n\r\nIn our study of the evolution of the plant, the insect, and the bird we\r\nwere seriously thwarted by the circumstance that their frames,\r\nsomewhat frail in themselves, were rarely likely to be entombed in good\r\nconditions for preservation. Earlier critics of evolution used, when\r\nthey were imperfectly acquainted with the conditions of fossilisation,\r\nto insinuate that this fragmentary nature of the geological record was a\r\nvery convenient refuge for the evolutionist who was pressed for positive\r\nevidence. The complaint is no longer found in any serious work. Where\r\nwe find excellent conditions for preservation, and animals suitable\r\nfor preservation living in the midst of them, the record is quite\r\nsatisfactory. We saw how the chalk has yielded remains of sea-urchins\r\nin the actual and gradual process of evolution. Tertiary beds which\r\nrepresent the muddy bottoms of tranquil lakes are sometimes equally\r\ninstructive in their fossils, especially of shell-fish. The Paludina of\r\na certain Slavonian lake-deposit is a classical example. It changes\r\nso greatly in the successive levels of the deposit that, if the\r\nintermediate forms were not preserved, we should divide it into several\r\ndifferent species. The Planorbis is another well-known example. In this\r\ncase we have a species evolving along several distinct lines into forms\r\nwhich differ remarkably from each other.\r\n\r\nThe Tertiary mammals, living generally on the land and only coming by\r\naccident into deposits suitable for preservation, cannot be expected to\r\nreveal anything like this sensible advance from form to form. They were,\r\nhowever, so numerous in the mid-Tertiary, and their bones are so well\r\ncalculated to survive when they do fall into suitable conditions, that\r\nwe can follow their development much more easily than that of the birds.\r\nWe find a number of strange patriarchal beasts entering the scene in the\r\nearly Eocene, and spreading into a great variety of forms in the genial\r\nconditions of the Oligocene and Miocene. As some of these forms advance,\r\nwe begin to descry in them the features, remote and shadowy at first, of\r\nthe horse, the deer, the elephant, the whale, the tiger, and our other\r\nfamiliar mammals. In some instances we can trace the evolution with a\r\nwonderful fullness, considering the remoteness of the period and\r\nthe conditions of preservation. Then, one by one, the abortive, the\r\ninelastic, the ill-fitted types are destroyed by changing conditions or\r\npowerful carnivores, and the field is left to the mammals which filled\r\nit when man in turn began his destructive career.\r\n\r\nThe first point of interest is the origin of these Tertiary mammals.\r\nTheir distinctive advantage over the mammals of the Mesozoic Era was-the\r\npossession by the mother of a placenta (the \"after-birth\" of the higher\r\nmammals), or structure in the womb by which the blood-vessels of the\r\nmother are brought into such association with those of the foetus that\r\nher blood passes into its arteries, and it is fully developed within the\r\nwarm shelter of her womb. The mammals of the Mesozoic had been small and\r\nprimitive animals, rarely larger than a rat, and never rising above the\r\nmarsupial stage in organisation. They not only continued to exist, and\r\ngive rise to their modern representatives (the opossum, etc.) during\r\nthe Tertiary Era, but they shared the general prosperity. In Australia,\r\nwhere they were protected from the higher carnivorous mammals, they\r\ngave rise to huge elephant-like wombats (Diprotodon), with skulls two\r\nor three feet in length. Over the earth generally, however, they were\r\nsuperseded by the placental mammals, which suddenly break into the\r\ngeological record in the early Tertiary, and spread with great vigour\r\nand rapidity over the four continents.\r\n\r\nWere they a progressive offshoot from the Mesozoic Marsupials, or\r\nMonotremes, or do they represent a separate stock from the primitive\r\nhalf-reptile and half-mammal family? The point is disputed; nor does the\r\nscantiness of the record permit us to tell the place of their origin.\r\nThe placental structure would be so great an advantage in a cold and\r\nunfavourable environment that some writers look to the northern land,\r\nconnecting Europe and America, for their development. We saw, however,\r\nthat this northern region was singularly warm until long after the\r\nspread of the mammals. Other experts, impressed by the parallel\r\ndevelopment of the mammals and the flowering plants, look to the\r\nelevated parts of eastern North America.\r\n\r\nSuch evidence as there is seems rather to suggest that South Africa\r\nwas the cradle of the placental mammals. We shall find that many of\r\nour mammals originated in Africa; there, too, is found to-day the most\r\nprimitive representative of the Tertiary mammals, the hyrax; and there\r\nwe find in especial abundance the remains of the mammal-like reptiles\r\n(Theromorphs) which are regarded as their progenitors. Further search\r\nin the unexplored geological treasures and dense forests of Africa is\r\nneeded. We may provisionally conceive the placental mammals as a group\r\nof the South African early mammals which developed a fortunate variation\r\nin womb-structure during the severe conditions of the early Mesozoic. In\r\nthis new structure they would have no preponderant advantage as long as\r\nthe genial Jurassic age favoured the great reptiles, and they may have\r\nremained as small and insignificant as the Marsupials. But with the\r\nfresh upheaval and climatic disturbance at the end of the Jurassic, and\r\nduring the Cretaceous, they spread northward, and replaced the dying\r\nreptiles, as the Angiosperms replaced the dying cycads. When they met\r\nthe spread of the Angiosperm vegetation they would receive another great\r\nstimulus to development.\r\n\r\nThey appear in Europe and North America in the earliest Cretaceous. The\r\nrise of the land had connected many hitherto isolated regions, and\r\nthey seem to have poured over every bridge into all parts of the four\r\ncontinents. The obscurity of their origin is richly compensated by their\r\nintense evolutionary interest from the moment they enter the geological\r\nrecord. We have seen this in the case of every important group of plants\r\nand animals, and can easily understand it. The ancestral group was\r\nsmall and local; the descendants are widely spread. While, therefore,\r\nwe discover remains of the later phases of development in our casual\r\ncuttings and quarries, the ancestral tomb may remain for ages in some\r\nunexplored province of the geological world. If this region is, as we\r\nsuspect, in Africa, our failure to discover it as yet is all the more\r\nintelligible.\r\n\r\nBut these mammals of the early Tertiary are still of such a patriarchal\r\nor ancestral character that the student of evolution can dispense with\r\ntheir earlier phase. They combine in their primitive frames, in an\r\nelementary way, the features which we now find distributed in widely\r\nremoved groups of their descendants. Most of them fall into two large\r\norders: the Condylarthra, the ancestral herbivores from which we shall\r\nfind our horses, oxen, deer, elephants, and hogs gradually issuing, and\r\nthe Creodonta, the patriarchal carnivores, which will give birth to our\r\nlions and tigers, wolves and foxes, and their various cousins. As yet\r\neven the two general types of herbivore and carnivore are so imperfectly\r\nseparated that it is not always possible to distinguish between them.\r\nNearly all of them have the five-toed foot of the reptile ancestor; and\r\nthe flat nails on their toes are the common material out of which the\r\nhoof of the ungulate and the claw of the carnivore will be presently\r\nfashioned. Nearly all have forty-four simply constructed teeth, from\r\nwhich will be evolved the grinders and tusks of the elephant or the\r\ncanines of the tiger. They answer in every respect to the theory that\r\nsome primitive local group was the common source of all our great\r\nmammals. With them are ancestral forms of Edentates (sloths, etc.) and\r\nInsectivores (moles, etc.), side-branches developing according to their\r\nspecial habits; and before the end of the Eocene we find primitive\r\nRodents (squirrels, etc.) and Cheiroptera (bats).\r\n\r\nFrom the description of the Tertiary world which we have seen in the\r\nlast chapter we understand the rapid evolution of the herbivorous\r\nCondylarthra. The rich vegetation which spreads over the northern\r\ncontinents, to which they have penetrated, gives them an enormous\r\nvitality and fecundity, and they break into groups, as they increase\r\nin number, adapted to the different conditions of forest, marsh, or\r\ngrass-covered plain. Some of them, swelling lazily on the abundant food,\r\nand secure for a time in their strength, become the Deinosaurs of their\r\nage, mere feeding and breeding machines. They are massive, sluggish,\r\nsmall-brained animals, their strong stumpy limbs terminating in broad\r\nfive-toed feet. Coryphodon, sometimes as large as an ox, is a typical\r\nrepresentative. It is a type fitted only for prosperous days, and these\r\nAmblypoda, as they are called, will disappear as soon as the great\r\ncarnivores are developed.\r\n\r\nAnother doomed race, or abortive experiment of early mammal life, were\r\nthe remarkable Deinocerata (\"terrible-horned\" mammals). They sometimes\r\nmeasured thirteen feet in length, but had little use for brain in the\r\nconditions in which they were developed. The brain of the Deinoceras was\r\nonly one-eighth the size of the brain of a rhinoceros of the same\r\nbulk; and the rhinoceros is a poor-brained representative of the modern\r\nmammals. To meet the growing perils of their race they seem to have\r\ndeveloped three pairs of horns on their long, flat skulls, as we find\r\non them three pairs of protuberances. A late specimen of the group,\r\nTinoceras, had a head four feet in length, armed with these six horns,\r\nand its canine teeth were developed into tusks sometimes seven or\r\neight inches in length. They suggest a race of powerful but clumsy and\r\ngrotesque monsters, making a last stand, and developing such means of\r\nprotection as their inelastic nature permitted. But the horns seem to\r\nhave proved a futile protection against the advancing carnivores, and\r\nthe race was extinguished. The horns may, of course, have been mainly\r\ndeveloped by, or for, the mutual butting of the males.\r\n\r\nThe extinction of these races will remind many readers of a theory on\r\nwhich it is advisable to say a word. It will be remembered that the\r\nlast of the Deinosaurs and the Ammonites also exhibited some remarkable\r\ndevelopments in their last days. These facts have suggested to some\r\nwriters the idea that expiring races pass through a death-agony, and\r\nseem to die a natural death of old age like individuals. The Trilobites\r\nare quoted as another instance; and some ingenious writers add the\r\nsupposed eccentricities of the Roman Empire in its senile decay and a\r\nnumber of other equally unsubstantial illustrations.\r\n\r\nThere is not the least ground for this fantastic speculation. The\r\ndestruction of these \"doomed races\" is as clearly traceable to external\r\ncauses as is the destruction of the Roman Empire; nor, in fact, did the\r\nRoman Empire develop any such eccentricities as are imagined in this\r\nsuperficial theory. What seem to our eye the \"eccentricities\" and\r\n\"convulsions\" of the Ceratopsia and Deinocerata are much more likely\r\nto be defensive developments against a growing peril, but they were\r\nas futile against the new carnivores as were the assegais of the Zulus\r\nagainst the European. On the other hand, the eccentricities of many\r\nof the later Trilobites--the LATEST Trilobites, it may be noted,\r\nwere chaste and sober specimens of their race, like the last Roman\r\npatricians--and of the Ammonites may very well have been caused by\r\nphysical and chemical changes in the sea-water. We know from experiment\r\nthat such changes have a disturbing influence, especially on the\r\ndevelopment of eggs and larvae; and we know from the geological record\r\nthat such changes occurred in the periods when the Trilobites and\r\nAmmonites perished. In fine, the vast majority of extinct races passed\r\nthrough no \"convulsions\" whatever. We may conclude that races do not\r\ndie; they are killed.\r\n\r\nThe extinction of these races of the early Condylarthra, and the\r\nsurvival of those races whose descendants share the earth with us\r\nto-day, are quite intelligible. The hand of natural selection lay heavy\r\non the Tertiary herbivores. Apart from overpopulation, forcing groups\r\nto adapt themselves to different regions and diets, and apart from the\r\ngeological disturbances and climatic changes which occurred in nearly\r\nevery period, the shadow of the advancing carnivores was upon them.\r\nPrimitive but formidable tigers, wolves, and hyenas were multiplying,\r\nand a great selective struggle set in. Some groups shrank from the\r\nbattle by burrowing underground like the rabbit; some, like the squirrel\r\nor the ape, took refuge in the trees; some, like the whale and seal,\r\nreturned to the water; some shrank into armour, like the armadillo, or\r\nbehind fences of spines, like the hedgehog; some, like the bat, escaped\r\ninto the air. Social life also was probably developed at this time, and\r\nthe great herds had their sentinels and leaders. But the most useful\r\nqualities of the large vegetarians, which lived on grass and leaf, were\r\nacuteness of perception to see the danger, and speed of limb to escape\r\nit. In other words, increase of brain and sense-power and increase of\r\nspeed were the primary requisites. The clumsy early Condylarthra failed\r\nto meet the tests, and perished; the other branches of the race were\r\nmore plastic, and, under the pressure of a formidable enemy, were\r\ngradually moulded into the horse, the deer, the ox, the antelope, and\r\nthe elephant.\r\n\r\nWe can follow the evolution of our mammals of this branch most easily\r\nby studying the modification of the feet and limbs. In a running\r\nattitude--the experiment may be tried--the weight of the body is shifted\r\nfrom the flat sole of the foot, and thrown upon the toes, especially the\r\ncentral toes. This indicates the line of development of the Ungulates\r\n(hoofed animals) in the struggle of the Tertiary Era. In the early\r\nEocene we find the Condylarthra (such as Phenacodus) with flat five-toed\r\nfeet, and such a mixed combination of characters that they \"might serve\r\nvery well for the ancestors of all the later Ungulata\" (Woodward).\r\nWe then presently find this generalised Ungulate branching into three\r\ntypes, one of which seems to be a patriarchal tapir, the second\r\nis regarded as a very remote ancestor of the horse, and the third\r\nforeshadows the rhinoceros. The feet have now only three or four toes;\r\none or two of the side-toes have disappeared. This evolution, however,\r\nfollows two distinct lines. In one group of these primitive Ungulates\r\nthe main axis of the limb, or the stress of the weight, passes through\r\nthe middle toe. This group becomes the Perissodactyla (\"odd-toed\"\r\nUngulates) of the zoologist, throwing out side-branches in the tapir\r\nand the rhinoceros, and culminating in the one-toed horse. In the other\r\nline, the Artiodactyla (the \"even-toed\" or cloven-hoofed Ungulates), the\r\nmain axis or stress passes between the third and fourth toes, and the\r\ngroup branches into our deer, oxen, sheep, pigs, camels, giraffes, and\r\nhippopotamuses. The elephant has developed along a separate and very\r\ndistinctive line, as we shall see, and the hyrax is a primitive survivor\r\nof the ancestral group.\r\n\r\nThus the evolutionist is able to trace a very natural order in the\r\nimmense variety of our Ungulates. He can follow them in theory as they\r\nslowly evolve from their primitive Eocene ancestor according to their\r\nvarious habits and environments; he has a very rich collection of fossil\r\nremains illustrating the stages of their development; and in the hyrax\r\n(or \"coney\") he has one more of those living fossils, or primitive\r\nsurvivors, which still fairly preserve the ancestral form. The hyrax has\r\nfour toes on the front foot and three on the hind foot, and the feet are\r\nflat. Its front teeth resemble those of a rodent, and its molars\r\nthose of the rhinoceros. In many respects it is a most primitive and\r\ngeneralised little animal, preserving the ancestral form more or less\r\nfaithfully since Tertiary days in the shelter of the African Continent.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the Ungulates continued to develop through the Tertiary, and\r\nfortunately we are enabled to follow the development of two of the most\r\ninteresting of them, the horse and the elephant, in considerable detail.\r\nAs I said above, the primitive Ungulate soon branches into three types\r\nwhich dimly foreshadow the tapir, the horse, and the rhinoceros, the\r\nthree forms of the Perissodactyl. The second of these types is the\r\nHyracotherium. It has no distinct equine features, and is known only\r\nfrom the skull, but the authorities regard it as the progenitor (or\r\nrepresentative of the progenitors) of the horse-types. In size it must\r\nhave been something like the rabbit or the hyrax. Still early in the\r\nEocene, however, we find the remains of a small animal (Eohippus), about\r\nthe size of a fox, which is described as \"undoubtedly horse-like.\" It\r\nhad only three toes on its hind feet, and four on its front feet; though\r\nit had also a splint-bone, representing the shrunken and discarded fifth\r\ntoe, on its fore feet. Another form of the same period (Protorohippus)\r\nshows the central of the three toes on the hind foot much enlarged, and\r\nthe lateral toes shrinking. The teeth, and the bones and joints of the\r\nlimbs, are also developing in the direction of the horse.\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding geological period, the Oligocene, we find several\r\nhorse-types in which the adaptation of the limbs to running on the firm\r\ngrassy plains and of the teeth to eating the grass continues. Mesohippus\r\nhas lost the fourth toe of the fore foot, which is now reduced to a\r\nsplintbone, and the lateral toes of its hind foot are shrinking. In the\r\nMiocene period there is a great development of the horse-like mammals.\r\nWe have the remains of more than forty species, some continuing the main\r\nline of development on the firm and growing prairies of the Miocene,\r\nsome branching into the softer meadows or the forests, and giving rise\r\nto types which will not outlive the Tertiary. They have three toes on\r\neach foot, and have generally lost even the rudimentary trace of the\r\nfourth toe. In most of them, moreover, the lateral toes--except in the\r\nmarsh-dwelling species, with spreading feet--scarcely touch the ground,\r\nwhile the central toe is developing a strong hoof. The leg-bones are\r\nlonger, and have a new type of joint; the muscles are concentrated near\r\nthe body. The front teeth are now chopping incisors, and the grinding\r\nteeth approach those of the modern horse in the distribution of the\r\nenamel, dentine, and cement. They are now about the size of a donkey,\r\nand must have had a distinctly horsy appearance, with their long necks\r\nand heads and tapering limbs. One of them, Merychippus, was probably in\r\nthe direct line of the evolution of the horse. From Hipparion some\r\nof the authorities believe that the zebras may have been developed.\r\nMiohippus, Protohippus, and Hypohippus, varying in size from that of a\r\nsheep to that of a donkey, are other branches of this spreading family.\r\n\r\nIn the Pliocene period the evolution of the main stem culminates in\r\nthe appearance of the horse, and the collateral branches are destroyed.\r\nPliohippus is a further intermediate form. It has only one toe on each\r\nfoot, with two large splint bones, but its hoof is less round than that\r\nof the horse, and it differs in the shape of the skull and the length\r\nof the teeth. The true horse (Equus) at length appears, in Europe and\r\nAmerica, before the close of the Tertiary period. As is well known, it\r\nstill has the rudimentary traces of its second and fourth toes in the\r\nshape of splint bones, and these bones are not only more definitely\r\ntoe-shaped in the foal before birth, but are occasionally developed and\r\ngive us a three-toed horse.\r\n\r\nFrom these successive remains we can confidently picture the evolution,\r\nduring two or three million years, of one of our most familiar mammals.\r\nIt must not, of course, be supposed that these fossil remains all\r\nrepresent \"ancestors of the horse.\" In some cases they may very well\r\ndo so; in others, as we saw, they represent sidebranches of the family\r\nwhich have become extinct. But even such successive forms as the\r\nEohippus, Mesohippus, Miohippus, and Pliohippus must not be arranged\r\nin a direct line as the pedigree of the horse. The family became most\r\nextensive in the Miocene, and we must regard the casual fossil specimens\r\nwe have discovered as illustrations of the various phases in the\r\ndevelopment of the horse from the primitive Ungulate. When we recollect\r\nwhat we saw in an earlier chapter about the evolution of grassy plains\r\nand the successive rises of the land during the Tertiary period, and\r\nwhen we reflect on the simultaneous advance of the carnivores, we can\r\nwithout difficulty realise this evolution of our familiar companion from\r\na hyrax-like little animal of two million years ago.\r\n\r\nWe have not in many cases so rich a collection of intermediate forms as\r\nin the case of the horse, but our fossil mammals are numerous enough\r\nto suggest a similar development of all the mammals of to-day. The\r\nprimitive family which gave birth to the horse also gave us, as we saw,\r\nthe tapir and the rhinoceros. We find ancestral tapirs in Europe and\r\nAmerica during the Tertiary period, but the later cold has driven them\r\nto the warm swamps of Brazil and Malaysia. The rhinoceros has had a long\r\nand interesting history. From the primitive Hyrochinus of the Eocene, in\r\nwhich it is dimly foreshadowed, we pass to a large and varied family\r\nin the later periods. In the Oligocene it spreads into three great\r\nbranches, adapted, respectively, to life on the elevated lands, the\r\nlowlands, and the water. The upland type (Hyracodon) was a light-limbed\r\nrunning animal, well illustrating the close relation to the horse. The\r\naquatic representative (Metamynodon) was a stumpy and bulky animal.\r\nThe intermediate lowland type was probably the ancestor of the modern\r\nanimal. All three forms were yet hornless. In the Miocene the lowland\r\ntype (Leptaceratherium, Aceratherium, etc.) develops vigorously, while\r\nthe other branches die. The European types now have two horns, and in\r\none of the American species (Diceratherium) we see a commencement of\r\nthe horny growths from the skull. We shall see later that the rhinoceros\r\ncontinued in Europe even during the severe conditions of the glacial\r\nperiod, in a branch that developed a woolly coat.\r\n\r\nThere were also in the early Tertiary several sidebranches of the\r\nhorse-tapir-rhinoceros family. The Palaeotheres were more or less\r\nbetween the horse and the tapir in structure; the Anoplotheres between\r\nthe tapir and the ruminant. A third doomed branch, the Titanotheres,\r\nflourished vigorously for a time, and begot some strange and monstrous\r\nforms (Brontops, Titanops, etc.). In the larger specimens the body was\r\nabout fourteen feet long, and stood ten feet from the ground. The long,\r\nlow skull had a pair of horns over the snout. They perished like the\r\nequally powerful but equally sluggish and stupid Deinocerata. The\r\nTertiary was an age of brain rather than of brawn. As compared with\r\ntheir early Tertiary representatives' some of our modern mammals have\r\nincreased seven or eight-fold in brain-capacity.\r\n\r\nWhile the horses and tapirs and rhinoceroses were being gradually\r\nevolved from the primitive types, the Artiodactyl branch of the\r\nUngulates--the pigs, deer, oxen, etc.--were also developing. We must\r\ndismiss them briefly. We saw that the primitive herbivores divided early\r\nin the Eocene into the \"odd-toed\" and \"even-toed\" varieties; the name\r\nrefers, it will be remembered, not to the number of toes, but to the\r\naxis of stress. The Artiodactyl group must have quickly branched in\r\nturn, as we find very primitive hogs and camels before the end of the\r\nEocene. The first hog-like creature (Homacodon) was much smaller than\r\nthe hog of to-day, and had strong canine teeth, but in the Oligocene\r\nthe family gave rise to a large and numerous race, the Elotheres. These\r\n\"giant-pigs,\" as they have been called, with two toes on each foot,\r\nflourished vigorously for a time in Europe and America, but were\r\nextinguished in the Miocene, when the true pigs made their appearance.\r\nAnother doomed race of the time is represented by the Hyopotamus,\r\nan animal between the pig and the hippopotamus; and the Oreodontids,\r\nbetween the hog and the deer, were another unsuccessful branch of the\r\nearly race. The hippopotamus itself was widespread in Europe, and\r\na familiar form in the rivers of Britain, in the latter part of the\r\nTertiary.\r\n\r\nThe camel seems to be traceable to a group of primitive North American\r\nUngulates (Paebrotherium, etc.) in the later Eocene period. The\r\nPaebrotherium, a small animal about two feet long, is followed by\r\nPliauchenia, which points toward the llamas and vicunas, and Procamelus,\r\nwhich clearly foreshadows the true camel. In the Pliocene the one branch\r\nwent southward, to develop into the llamas and vicunas, and the other\r\nbranch crossed to Asia, to develop into the camels. Since that time they\r\nhave had no descendants in North America.\r\n\r\nThe primitive giraffe appears suddenly in the later Tertiary deposits of\r\nEurope and Asia. The evidence points to an invasion from Africa, and,\r\nas the region of development is unknown and unexplored, the evolution of\r\nthe giraffe remains a matter of speculation. Chevrotains flourished in\r\nEurope and North America in the Oligocene, and are still very primitive\r\nin structure, combining features of the hog and the ruminants. Primitive\r\ndeer and oxen begin in the Miocene, and seem to have an earlier\r\nrepresentative in certain American animals (Protoceras), of which the\r\nmale has a pair of blunt outgrowths between the ears. The first true\r\ndeer are hornless (like the primitive muskdeer of Asia to-day), but by\r\nthe middle of the Miocene the males have small two-pronged antlers, and\r\nas the period proceeds three or four more prongs are added. It is some\r\nconfirmation of the evolutionary embryonic law that we find the antlers\r\ndeveloping in this way in the individual stag to-day. A very\r\ncurious race of ruminants in the later Tertiary was a large antelope\r\n(Sivatherium) with four horns. It had not only the dimensions, but\r\napparently some of the characters, of an elephant.\r\n\r\nThe elephant itself, the last type of the Ungulates, has a clearer line\r\nof developments. A chance discovery of fossils in the Fayum district in\r\nEgypt led Dr. C. W. Andrews to make a special exploration, and on the\r\nremains which he found he has constructed a remarkable story of the\r\nevolution of the elephant. [*] It is clear that the elephant was developed\r\nin Africa, and a sufficiently complete series of remains has been found\r\nto give a good idea of the origin of its most distinctive features.\r\nIn the Eocene period there lived in the Egyptian region an animal,\r\nsomething like the tapir in size and appearance, which had its second\r\nincisors developed into small tusks and--to judge from the nasal opening\r\nin the skull--a somewhat prolonged snout. This animal (Moeritherium)\r\nonly differed from the ordinary primitive Ungulate in these incipient\r\nelephantine features. In the later Eocene a larger and more advanced\r\nanimal, the Palaeomastodon, makes its appearance. Its tusks are larger\r\n(five or six inches long), its molars more elephantine, the air-cells\r\nat the back of the head more developed. It would look like a small\r\nelephant, except that it had a long snout, instead of a flexible trunk,\r\nand a projecting lower jaw on which the snout rested.\r\n\r\n     *See this short account, \"Guide to the Elephants in the\r\n     British Museum,\" 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to the beginning of the Miocene, Africa was, as we saw, cut off from\r\nEurope and Asia by the sea which stretched from Spain to India. Then the\r\nland rose, and the elephant passed by the new tracts into the north. Its\r\nnext representative, Tetrabelodon, is found in Asia and Europe, as\r\nwell as North Africa. The frame is as large as that of a medium-sized\r\nelephant, and the increase of the air-cells at the back of the skull\r\nshows that an increased weight has to be sustained by the muscles of the\r\nneck. The nostrils are shifted further back. The tusks are from twenty\r\nto thirty inches long, and round, and only differ from those of the\r\nelephant in curving slightly downward, The chin projects as far as the\r\ntusks. The neck is shorter and thicker, and, as the animal increases in\r\nheight, we can understand that the long snout--possibly prehensile at\r\nits lower end--is necessary for the animal to reach the ground. But\r\nthe snout still lies on the projecting lower jaw, and is not a trunk.\r\nPassing over the many collateral branches, which diverge in various\r\ndirections, we next kind that the chin is shortening (in Tetrabelodon\r\nlongirostris), and, through a long series of discovered intermediate\r\nforms, we trace the evolution of the elephant from the mastodon. The\r\nlong supporting skin disappears, and the enormous snout becomes a\r\nflexible trunk. Southern Asia seems to have been the province of this\r\nfinal transformation, and we have remains of some of these primitive\r\nelephants with tusks nine and a half feet long. A later species, which\r\nwandered over Central and Southern Europe before the close of the\r\nTertiary, stood fifteen feet high at the shoulder, while the mammoth,\r\nwhich superseded it in the days of early man, had at times tusks more\r\nthan ten feet in length.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to reflect that this light on the evolution of one of\r\nour most specialised mammals is due to the chance opening of the soil\r\nin an obscure African region. It suggests to us that as geological\r\nexploration is extended, many similar discoveries may be made. The\r\nslenderness of the geological record is a defect that the future may\r\nconsiderably modify.\r\n\r\nFrom this summary review of the evolution of the Ungulates we must now\r\npass to an even briefer account of the evolution of the Carnivores. The\r\nevidence is less abundant, but the characters of the Carnivores consist\r\nso obviously of adaptations to their habits and diet that we have little\r\ndifficulty in imagining their evolution. Their early Eocene ancestors,\r\nthe Creodonts, gave rise in the Eocene to forms which we may regard as\r\nthe forerunners of the cat-family and dog-family, to which most of our\r\nfamiliar Carnivores belong. Patriofelis, the \"patriarchal cat,\" about\r\nfive or six feet in length (without the tail), curiously combines\r\nthe features of the cat and the seal-family. Cyonodon has a wolf-like\r\nappearance, and Amphicyon rather suggests the fox. Primitive weasels,\r\ncivets, and hyaenas appear also in the Eocene. The various branches of\r\nthe Carnivore family are already roughly represented, but it is an age\r\nof close relationships and generalised characters.\r\n\r\nIn the Miocene we find the various groups diverging still further from\r\neach other and from the extinct stocks. Definite wolves and foxes abound\r\nin America, and the bear, civet, and hyaena are represented in Europe,\r\ntogether with vague otter-like forms. The dog-family seems to have\r\ndeveloped chiefly in North America. As in the case of the Ungulates,\r\nwe find many strange side-branches which flourished for a time, but are\r\nunknown to-day. Machoerodus, usually known as \"the sabre-toothed tiger,\"\r\nthough not a tiger, was one of the most formidable of these transitory\r\nraces. Its upper canine teeth (the \"sabres\") were several inches in\r\nlength, and it had enormously distensible jaws to make them effective.\r\nThe great development of such animals, with large numbers of hyaenas,\r\ncivets, wolves, bears, and other Carnivores, in the middle and later\r\nTertiary was probably the most effective agency in the evolution of\r\nthe horse and deer and the extinction of the more sluggish races. The\r\naquatic branch of the Carnivores (seals, walruses, etc.) is little\r\nrepresented in the Tertiary record. We saw, however, that the most\r\nprimitive representatives of the elephant-stock had also some characters\r\nof the seal, and it is thought that the two had a common origin.\r\n\r\nThe Moeritherium was a marsh-animal, and may very well have been cousin\r\nto the branch of the family which pushed on to the seas, and developed\r\nits fore limbs into paddles.\r\n\r\nThe Rodents are represented in primitive form early in the Eocene\r\nperiod. The teeth are just beginning to show the characteristic\r\nmodification for gnawing. A large branch of the family, the Tillodonts,\r\nattained some importance a little later. They are described as combining\r\nthe head and claws of a bear with the teeth of a rodent and the general\r\ncharacters of an ungulate. In the Oligocene we find primitive squirrels,\r\nbeavers, rabbits, and mice. The Insectivores also developed some of the\r\npresent types at an early date, and have since proved so unprogressive\r\nthat some regard them as the stock from which all the placental mammals\r\nhave arisen.\r\n\r\nThe Cetacea (whales, porpoises, etc.) are already represented in the\r\nEocene by a primitive whale-like animal (Zeuglodon) of unknown origin.\r\nSome specimens of it are seventy feet in length. It has large teeth,\r\nsometimes six inches long, and is clearly a terrestrial mammal that\r\nhas returned to the waters. Some forms even of the modern whale develop\r\nrudimentary teeth, and in all forms the bony structure of the fore limbs\r\nand degenerate relic of a pelvis and back limbs plainly tell of the\r\nterrestrial origin. Dolphins appear in the Miocene.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Edentates (sloths, anteaters, and armadilloes) are\r\nrepresented in a very primitive form in the early Eocene. They are then\r\nbarely distinguishable from the Condylarthra and Creodonta, and seem\r\nonly recently to have issued from a common ancestor with those groups.\r\nIn the course of the Tertiary we find them--especially in South America,\r\nwhich was cut off from the North and its invading Carnivores during\r\nthe Eocene and Miocene--developed into large sloths, armadilloes, and\r\nanteaters. The reconnection with North America in the Pliocene allowed\r\nthe northern animals to descend, but gigantic sloths (Megatherium) and\r\narmadilloes (Glyptodon) flourished long afterwards in South America.\r\nThe Megatherium attained a length of eighteen feet in one specimen\r\ndiscovered, and the Glyptodon often had a dorsal shield (like that of\r\nthe armadillo) from six to eight feet long, and, in addition, a stoutly\r\narmoured tail several feet long.\r\n\r\nThe richness and rapidity of the mammalian development in the Tertiary,\r\nof which this condensed survey will convey some impression, make it\r\nimpossible to do more here than glance over the vast field and indicate\r\nthe better-known connections. It will be seen that evolution not only\r\nintroduces a lucid order and arrangement into our thousands of species\r\nof living and fossil mammals, but throws an admirable light on the\r\nhigher animal world of our time. The various orders into which the\r\nzoologist puts our mammals are seen to be the branches of a living tree,\r\napproaching more and more closely to each other in early Tertiary times,\r\nin spite of the imperfectness of the geological record. We at last trace\r\nthese diverging lines to a few very primitive, generalised, patriarchal\r\ngroups, which in turn approach each other very closely in structure,\r\nand plainly suggest a common Cretaceous ancestor. Whether that common\r\nancestor was an Edentate, an Insectivore, or Creodont, or something more\r\nprimitive than them all, is disputed. But the divergence of nearly all\r\nthe lines of our mammal world from those patriarchal types is admirably\r\nclear. In the mutual struggle of carnivore and herbivore, in adaptation\r\nto a hundred different environments (the water, the land, and the air,\r\nthe tree, the open plain, the underground, the marsh, etc.) and forms\r\nof diet, we find the descendants of these patriarchal animals gradually\r\ndeveloping their distinctive characters. Then we find the destructive\r\nagencies of living and inorganic nature blotting out type after type,\r\nand the living things that spread over the land in the later Tertiary\r\nare found to be broadly identical with the living things of to-day. The\r\nlast great selection, the northern Ice-Age, will give the last touches\r\nof modernisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. THE EVOLUTION OF MAN\r\n\r\nWe have reserved for a closer inquiry that order of the placental\r\nmammals to which we ourselves belong, and on which zoologists have\r\nbestowed the very proper and distinguishing name of the Primates. Since\r\nthe days of Darwin there has been some tendency to resent the term\r\n\"lower animals,\" which man applies to his poorer relations. But, though\r\nthere is no such thing as an absolute standard by which we may judge the\r\n\"higher\" or \"lower\" status of animals or plants, the extraordinary power\r\nwhich man has by his brain development attained over both animate and\r\ninanimate nature fully justifies the phrase. The Primate order is,\r\ntherefore, of supreme interest as the family that gave birth to man, and\r\nit is important to discover the agencies which impelled some primitive\r\nmember of it to enter upon the path which led to this summit of organic\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThe order includes the femurs, a large and primitive family with\r\nape-like features--the Germans call them \"half-apes\"--the monkeys,\r\nthe man-like apes, and man. This classification according to structure\r\ncorresponds with the successive appearance of the various families in\r\nthe geological record. The femurs appear in the Eocene; the monkeys, and\r\nafterwards the apes, in the Miocene, the first semi-human forms in the\r\nPleistocene, though they must have been developed before this. It is\r\nhardly necessary to say that science does not regard man as a descendant\r\nof the known anthropoid apes, or these as descended from the monkeys.\r\nThey are successive types or phases of development, diverging early from\r\neach other. Just as the succeeding horse-types of the record are not\r\nnecessarily related to each other in a direct line, yet illustrate the\r\nevolution of a type which culminates in the horse, so the spreading and\r\nbranching members of the Primate group illustrate the evolution of a\r\ntype of organism which culminates in man. The particular relationship of\r\nthe various families, living and dead, will need careful study.\r\n\r\nThat there is a general blood-relationship, and that man is much\r\nmore closely related to the anthropoid apes than to any of the lower\r\nPrimates, is no longer a matter of controversy. In Rudolph Virchow there\r\ndied, a few years ago, the last authoritative man of science to express\r\nany doubt about it. There are, however, non-scientific writers who, by\r\nrepeating the ambiguous phrase that it is \"only a theory,\" convey the\r\nimpression to inexpert readers that it is still more or less an open\r\nquestion. We will therefore indicate a few of the lines of evidence\r\nwhich have overcome the last hesitations of scientific men, and closed\r\nthe discussion as to the fact.\r\n\r\nThe very close analogy of structure between man and the ape at once\r\nsuggests that they had a common ancestor. There are cases in which two\r\nwidely removed animals may develop a similar organ independently, but\r\nthere is assuredly no possibility of their being alike in all organs,\r\nunless by common inheritance. Yet the essential identity of structure in\r\nman and the ape is only confirmed by every advance of science, and would\r\nof itself prove the common parentage. Such minor differences as there\r\nare between man and the higher ape--in the development of the cerebrum,\r\nthe number of the teeth or ribs, the distribution of the hair, and so\r\non--are quite explicable when we reflect that the two groups must have\r\ndiverged from each other more than a million years ago.\r\n\r\nExamining the structure of man more closely, we find this strong\r\nsuggestion of relationship greatly confirmed. It is now well known that\r\nthe human body contains a number of vestigial \"organs\"--organs of no\r\nactual use, and only intelligible as vestiges of organs that were once\r\nuseful. Whatever view we take of the origin of man, each organ in\r\nhis frame must have a meaning; and, as these organs are vestigial and\r\nuseless even in the lowest tribes of men, who represent primitive man,\r\nthey must be vestiges of organs that were of use in a remote pre-human\r\nancestor. The one fact that the ape has the same vestigial organs as man\r\nwould, on a scientific standard of evidence, prove the common descent of\r\nthe two. But these interesting organs themselves point back far earlier\r\nthan a mixed ape-human ancestor in many cases.\r\n\r\nThe shell of cartilage which covers the entrance to the ear--the gristly\r\nappendage which is popularly called the ear--is one of the clearest and\r\nmost easily recognised of these organs. The \"ear\" of a horse or a cat is\r\nan upright mobile shell for catching the waves of sound. The human ear\r\nhas the appearance of being the shrunken relic of such an organ, and,\r\nwhen we remove the skin, and find seven generally useless muscles\r\nattached to it, obviously intended to pull the shell in all directions\r\n(as in the horse), there can be no doubt that the external ear is a\r\ndiscarded organ, a useless legacy from an earlier ancestor. In cases\r\nwhere it has been cut off it was found that the sense of hearing was\r\nscarcely, if at all, affected. Now we know that it is similarly useless\r\nin all tribes of men, and must therefore come from a pre-human ancestor.\r\nIt is also vestigial in the higher apes, and it is only when we descend\r\nto the lower monkeys and femurs that we see it approaching its primitive\r\nuseful form. One may almost say that it is a reminiscence of the far-off\r\nperiod when, probably in the early Tertiary, the ancestors of the\r\nPrimates took to the trees. The animals living on the plain needed\r\nacute senses to detect the approach of their prey or their enemies;\r\nthe tree-dweller found less demand on his sense of hearing, the\r\n\"speaking-trumpet\" was discarded, and the development of the internal\r\near proceeded on the higher line of the perception of musical sounds.\r\n\r\nWe might take a very large number of parts of the actual human body, and\r\ndiscover that they are similar historical or archaeological monuments\r\nsurviving in a modern system, but we have space only for a few of the\r\nmore conspicuous.\r\n\r\nThe hair on the body is a vestigial organ, of actual use to no race of\r\nmen, an evident relic of the thick warm coat of an earlier ancestor. It\r\nin turn recalls the dwellers in the primeval forest. In most cases--not\r\nall, because the wearing of clothes for ages has modified this\r\nfeature--it will be found that the hairs on the arm tend upward from the\r\nwrist to the elbow, and downward from the shoulder to the elbow. This\r\nvery peculiar feature becomes intelligible when we find that some of the\r\napes also have it, and that it has a certain use in their case. They put\r\ntheir hands over their heads as they sit in the trees during ram, and in\r\nthat position the sloping hair acts somewhat like the thatched roof of a\r\ncottage.\r\n\r\nAgain, it will be found that in the natural position of standing we are\r\nnot perfectly flat-footed, but tend to press much more on the outer than\r\non the inner edge of the foot. This tendency, surviving after ages\r\nof living on the level ground, is a lingering effect of the far-off\r\narboreal days.\r\n\r\nA more curious reminiscence is seen in the fact that the very young\r\ninfant, flabby and powerless as it is in most of its muscles, is so\r\nstrong in the muscles of the hand and arm that it can hang on to a stick\r\nby its hands, and sustain the whole weight of its body, for several\r\nminutes. Finally, our vestigial tail--for we have a tail comparable to\r\nthat of the higher apes--must be mentioned. In embryonic development\r\nthe tail is much longer than the legs, and some children are born with\r\na real tail, which they move as the puppy does, according to their\r\nemotional condition. Other features of the body point back to an even\r\nearlier stage. The vermiform appendage--in which some recent medical\r\nwriters have vainly endeavoured to find a utility--is the shrunken\r\nremainder of a large and normal intestine of a remote ancestor. This\r\ninterpretation of it would stand even if it were found to have a certain\r\nuse in the human body. Vestigial organs are sometimes pressed into a\r\nsecondary use when their original function has been lost. The danger of\r\nthis appendage in the human body to-day is due to the fact that it is\r\na blind alley leading off the alimentary canal, and has a very narrow\r\nopening. In the ape the opening is larger, and, significantly enough, it\r\nis still larger in the human foetus. When we examine some of the lower\r\nmammals we discover the meaning of it. It is in them an additional\r\nstorage chamber in the alimentary system. It is believed that a change\r\nto a more digestible diet has made this additional chamber superfluous\r\nin the Primates, and the system is slowly suppressing it.\r\n\r\nOther reminiscences of this earlier phase are found in the many\r\nvestigial muscles which are found in the body to-day. The head of the\r\nquadruped hangs forward, and is held by powerful muscles and ligaments\r\nin the neck. We still have the shrunken remainder of this arrangement.\r\nOther vestigial muscles are found in the forehead, the scalp, the\r\nnose--many people can twitch the nostrils and the scalp--and under the\r\nskin in many parts of the body. These are enfeebled remnants of the\r\nmuscular coat by which the quadruped twitches its skin, and drives\r\ninsects away. A less obvious feature is found by the anatomist in\r\ncertain blood-vessels of the trunk. As the blood flows vertically in a\r\nbiped and horizontally in a quadruped, the arrangement of the valves in\r\nthe blood-vessels should be different in the two cases; but it is the\r\nsame in us as in the quadruped. Another trace of the quadruped ancestor\r\nis found in the baby. It walks \"on all fours\" so long, not merely from\r\nweakness of the limbs, but because it has the spine of a quadruped.\r\n\r\nA much more interesting fact, but one less easy to interpret, is that\r\nthe human male has, like the male ape, organs for suckling the young.\r\nThat there are real milk-glands, usually vestigial, underneath the teats\r\nin the breast of the boy or the man is proved by the many known cases in\r\nwhich men have suckled the young. Several friends of the present writer\r\nhave seen this done in India and Ceylon by male \"wet-nurses.\" As there\r\nis no tribe of men or species of ape in which the male suckles the young\r\nnormally, we seem to be thrown back once more upon an earlier ancestor.\r\nThe difficulty is that we know of no mammal of which both parents\r\nsuckle the young, and some authorities think that the breasts have been\r\ntransferred to the male by a kind of embryonic muddle. That is difficult\r\nto believe, as no other feature has ever been similarly transferred to\r\nthe opposite sex. In any case the male breasts are vestigial organs.\r\nAnother peculiarity of the mammary system is that sometimes three, four,\r\nor five pairs of breasts appear in a woman (and several have been known\r\neven in a man). This is, apparently, an occasional reminiscence of an\r\nearly mammal ancestor which had large litters of young and several pairs\r\nof breasts.\r\n\r\nBut there are features of the human body which recall an ancestor even\r\nearlier than the quadruped. The most conspicuous of these is the little\r\nfleshy pad at the inner corner of each eye. It is a common feature in\r\nmammals, and is always useless. When, however, we look lower down in the\r\nanimal scale we find that fishes and reptiles (and birds) have a third\r\neyelid, which is drawn across the eye from this corner. There is little\r\nroom to doubt that the little fleshy vestige in the mammal's eye is the\r\nshrunken remainder of the lateral eyelid of a remote fish-ancestor.\r\n\r\nA similar reminiscence is found in the pineal body, a small and useless\r\nobject, about the size and shape of a hazel-nut, in the centre of the\r\nbrain. When we examine the reptile we find a third eye in the top of\r\nthe head. The skin has closed over it, but the skull is still, in\r\nmany cases, perforated as it is for the eyes in front. I have seen it\r\nstanding out like a ball on the head of a dead crocodile, and in the\r\nliving tuatara--the very primitive New Zealand lizard--it still has a\r\nretina and optic nerve. As the only animal in nature to-day with an eye\r\nin this position (the Pyrosome, a little marine animal of the sea-squirt\r\nfamily) is not in the line of reptile and mammal ancestry, it is\r\ndifficult to locate the third eye definitely. But when we find the skin\r\nclosing over it in the amphibian and reptile, then the bone, and then\r\nsee it gradually atrophying and being buried under the growing brain, we\r\nmust refer it to some early fish-ancestor. This ancestor, we may recall,\r\nis also reflected for a time in the gill-slits and arches, with their\r\ncorresponding fish-like heart and blood-vessels, during man's embryonic\r\ndevelopment, as we saw in a former chapter.\r\n\r\nThese are only a few of the more conspicuous instances of vestigial\r\nstructures in man. Metchnikoff describes about a hundred of them. Even\r\nif there were no remains of primitive man pointing in the direction of\r\na common ancestry with the ape, no lower types of men in existence with\r\nthe same tendency, no apes found in nature to-day with a structure so\r\nstrikingly similar to that of man, and no fossil records telling of the\r\ndivergence of forms from primitive groups in past time, we should be\r\nforced to postulate the evolution of man in order to explain his actual\r\nfeatures. The vestigial structures must be interpreted as we interpret\r\nthe buttons on the back of a man's coat. They are useless reminiscences\r\nof an age in which they were useful. When their witness to the past\r\nis supported by so many converging lines of evidence it becomes\r\nirresistible. I will add only one further testimony which has been\r\nbrought into court in recent years.\r\n\r\nThe blood consists of cells, or minute disk-shaped corpuscles, floating\r\nin a watery fluid, or serum. It was found a few years ago, in the course\r\nof certain experiments in mixing the blood of animals, that the serum of\r\none animal's blood sometimes destroyed the cells of the other animal's\r\nblood, and at other times did not. When the experiments were multiplied,\r\nit was found that the amount of destructive action exercised by one\r\nspecimen of blood upon another depended on the nearness or remoteness of\r\nrelationship between the animals. If the two are closely related, there\r\nis no disturbance when their blood is mixed; when they are not closely\r\nrelated, the serum of one destroys the cells of the other, and the\r\nintensity of the action is in proportion to their remoteness from each\r\nother. Another and more elaborate form of the experiment was devised,\r\nand the law was confirmed. On both tests it was found by experiment that\r\nthe blood of man and of the anthropoid ape behaved in such a way as to\r\nprove that they were closely related. The blood of the monkey showed a\r\nless close relationship--a little more remote in the New World than in\r\nthe Old World monkeys; and the blood of the femur showed a faint and\r\ndistant relationship.\r\n\r\nThe FACT of the evolution of man and the apes from a common ancestor is,\r\ntherefore, outside the range of controversy in science; we are concerned\r\nonly to retrace the stages of that evolution, and the agencies which\r\ncontrolled it. Here, unfortunately, the geological record gives us\r\nlittle aid. Tree-dwelling animals are amongst the least likely to\r\nbe buried in deposits which may preserve their bones for ages. The\r\ndistribution of femur and ape remains shows that the order of the\r\nPrimates has been widespread and numerous since the middle of the\r\nTertiary Era, yet singularly few remains of the various families have\r\nbeen preserved.\r\n\r\nHence the origin of the Primates is obscure. They are first foreshadowed\r\nin certain femur-like forms of the Eocene period, which are said in some\r\ncases (Adapis) to combine the characters of pachyderms and femurs, and\r\nin others (Anaptomorphus) to unite the features of Insectivores and\r\nfemurs. Perhaps the more common opinion is that they were evolved from\r\na branch of the Insectivores, but the evidence is too slender to justify\r\nan opinion. It was an age when the primitive placental mammals were just\r\nbeginning to diverge from each other, and had still many features in\r\ncommon. For the present all we can say is that in the earliest spread\r\nof the patriarchal mammal race one branch adopted arboreal life, and\r\nevolved in the direction of the femurs and the apes. The generally\r\narboreal character of the Primates justifies this conclusion.\r\n\r\nIn the Miocene period we find a great expansion of the monkeys. These in\r\nturn enter the scene quite suddenly, and the authorities are reduced to\r\nuncertain and contradictory conjectures as to their origin. Some think\r\nthat they develop not from the femurs, but along an independent line\r\nfrom the Insectivores, or other ancestors of the Primates. We will not\r\nlinger over these early monkeys, nor engage upon the hopeless task of\r\ntracing their gradual ramification into the numerous families of the\r\npresent age. It is clear only that they soon divided into two main\r\nstreams, one of which spread into the monkeys of America and the other\r\ninto the monkeys of the Old World. There are important anatomical\r\ndifferences between the two. The monkeys remained in Central and\r\nSouthern Europe until near the end of the Tertiary. Gradually we\r\nperceive that the advancing cold is driving them further south, and\r\nthe monkeys of Gibraltar to-day are the diminished remnant of the great\r\nfamily that had previously wandered as far as Britain and France.\r\n\r\nA third wave, also spreading in the Miocene, equally obscure in its\r\nconnection with the preceding, introduces the man-like apes to the\r\ngeologist. Primitive gibbons (Pliopithecus and Pliobylobates),\r\nprimitive chimpanzees (Palaeopithecus), and other early anthropoid\r\napes (Oreopithecus, Dryopithecus, etc.), lived in the trees of Southern\r\nEurope in the second part of the Tertiary Era. They are clearly\r\ndisconnected individuals of a large and flourishing family, but from the\r\nhalf-dozen specimens we have yet discovered no conclusion can be drawn,\r\nexcept that the family is already branching into the types of anthropoid\r\napes which are familiar to us.\r\n\r\nOf man himself we have no certain and indisputable trace in the Tertiary\r\nEra. Some remains found in Java of an ape-man (Pithecanthropus),\r\nwhich we will study later, are now generally believed, after a special\r\ninvestigation on the spot, to belong to the Pleistocene period. Yet no\r\nauthority on the subject doubts that the human species was evolved in\r\nthe Tertiary Era, and very many, if not most, of the authorities believe\r\nthat we have definite proof of his presence. The early story of mankind\r\nis gathered, not so much from the few fragments of human remains we\r\nhave, but from the stone implements which were shaped by his primitive\r\nintelligence and remain, almost imperishable, in the soil over which he\r\nwandered. The more primitive man was, the more ambiguous would be\r\nthe traces of his shaping of these stone implements, and the earliest\r\nspecimens are bound to be a matter of controversy. It is claimed by many\r\ndistinguished authorities that flints slightly touched by the hand of\r\nman, or at least used as implements by man, are found in abundance\r\nin England, France, and Germany, and belong to the Pliocene period.\r\nContinental authorities even refer some of them to the Miocene and the\r\nlast part of the Oligocene.\r\n\r\nThe question whether an implement-using animal, which nearly all would\r\nagree to regard as in some degree human, wandered over what is now\r\nthe South of England (Kent, Essex, Dorsetshire, etc.) as many hundred\r\nthousand years ago as this claim would imply, is certainly one of great\r\ninterest. But there would be little use in discussing here the question\r\nof the \"Eoliths,\" as these disputed implements are called. A very keen\r\ncontroversy is still being conducted in regard to them, and some of the\r\nhighest authorities in England, France, and Germany deny that they show\r\nany trace of human workmanship or usage. Although they have the support\r\nof such high authorities as Sir J. Prestwich, Sir E. Ray Lankester, Lord\r\nAvebury, Dr. Keane, Dr. Blackmore, Professor Schwartz, etc., they are\r\none of those controverted testimonies on which it would be ill-advised\r\nto rely in such a work as this.\r\n\r\nWe must say, then, that we have no undisputed traces of man in the\r\nTertiary Era. The Tertiary implements which have been at various times\r\nclaimed in France, Italy, and Portugal are equally disputed; the remains\r\nwhich were some years ago claimed as Tertiary in the United States are\r\ngenerally disallowed; and the recent claims from South America are under\r\ndiscussion. Yet it is the general feeling of anthropologists that man\r\nwas evolved in the Tertiary Era. On the one hand, the anthropoid apes\r\nwere highly developed by the Miocene period, and it would be almost\r\nincredible that the future human stock should linger hundreds of\r\nthousands of years behind them. On the other hand, when we find the\r\nfirst traces of man in the Pleistocene, this development has already\r\nproceeded so far that its earlier phase evidently goes back into the\r\nTertiary. Let us pass beyond the Tertiary Era for a moment, and examine\r\nthe earliest and most primitive remains we have of human or semi-human\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\nThe first appearance of man in the chronicle of terrestrial life is a\r\nmatter of great importance and interest. Even the least scientific of\r\nreaders stands, so to say, on tiptoe to catch a first glimpse of\r\nthe earliest known representative of our race, and half a century of\r\ndiscussion of evolution has engendered a very wide interest in the early\r\nhistory of man. [*]\r\n\r\n     * A personal experience may not be without interest in this\r\n     connection. Among the many inquiries directed to me in\r\n     regard to evolution I received, in one month, a letter from\r\n     a negro in British Guiana and an extremely sensible query\r\n     from an inmate of an English asylum for the insane! The\r\n     problem that beset the latter of the two was whether the\r\n     Lemuranda preceded the Lemurogona in Eocene times. He had\r\n     found a contradiction in the statements of two scientific\r\n     writers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFortunately, although these patriarchal bones are very scanty--two\r\nteeth, a thigh-bone, and the skull-cap--we are now in a position to form\r\nsome idea of the nature of their living owner. They have been subjected\r\nto so searching a scrutiny and discussion since they were found in\r\nJava in 1891 and 1892 that there is now a general agreement as to their\r\nnature. At first some of the experts thought that they were the remains\r\nof an abnormally low man, and others that they belonged to an abnormally\r\nhigh ape. The majority held from the start that they belonged to a\r\nmember of a race almost midway between the highest family of apes and\r\nthe lowest known tribe of men, and therefore fully merited the name\r\nof \"Ape-Man\" (Pithecanthropus). This is now the general view of\r\nanthropologists.\r\n\r\nThe Ape-Man of Java was in every respect entitled to that name. The\r\nteeth suggest a lower part of the face in which the teeth and lips\r\nprojected more than in the most ape-like types of Central Africa.\r\nThe skull-cap has very heavy ridges over the eyes and a low receding\r\nforehead, far less human than in any previously known prehistoric skull.\r\nThe thigh-bone is very much heavier than any known human femur of the\r\nsame length, and so appreciably curved that the owner was evidently in\r\na condition of transition from the semi-quadrupedal crouch of the ape\r\nto the erect attitude of man. The Ape-Man, in other words, was a heavy,\r\nsquat, powerful, bestial-looking animal; of small stature, but above the\r\npygmy standard; erect in posture, but with clear traces of the proneness\r\nof his ancestor; far removed from the highest ape in brainpower, but\r\nalmost equally far removed from the lowest savage that is known to\r\nus. We shall see later that there is some recent criticism, by weighty\r\nauthorities, of the earlier statements in regard to the brain of\r\nprimitive man. This does not apply to the Ape-Man of Java. The average\r\ncranial capacity (the amount of brain-matter the skull may contain) of\r\nthe chimpanzees, the highest apes, is about 600 cubic centimetres.\r\nThe average cranial capacity of the lowest races of men, of moderate\r\nstature, is about 1200. And the cranial capacity of Ape-Man was about\r\n900\r\n\r\nIt is immaterial whether or no these bones belong to the same\r\nindividual. If they do not, we have remains of two or three individuals\r\nof the same intermediate species. Nor does it matter whether or no this\r\nearly race is a direct ancestor of the later races of men, or an extinct\r\noffshoot from the advancing human stock. It is, in either case, an\r\nillustration of the intermediate phase between the ape and man The more\r\nimportant tasks are to trace the relationship of this early human stock\r\nto the apes, and to discover the causes of its superior evolution.\r\n\r\nThe first question has a predominantly technical interest, and the\r\nauthorities are not agreed in replying to it. We saw that, on the\r\nblood-test, man showed a very close relationship to the anthropoid apes,\r\na less close affinity to the Old World monkeys, a more remote affinity\r\nto the American monkeys, and a very faint and distant affinity to the\r\nfemurs. A comparison of their structures suggests the same conclusion.\r\nIt is, therefore, generally believed that the anthropoid apes and man\r\nhad a common ancestor in the early Miocene or Oligocene, that this group\r\nwas closely related to the ancestral group of the Old World monkeys, and\r\nthat all originally sprang from a primitive and generalised femur-group.\r\nIn other words, a branch of the earliest femur-like forms diverges,\r\nbefore the specific femur-characters are fixed, in the direction of the\r\nmonkey; in this still vague and patriarchal group a branch diverges,\r\nbefore the monkey-features are fixed, in the direction of the\r\nanthropoids; and this group in turn spreads into a number of types, some\r\nof which are the extinct apes of the Miocene, four become the gorilla,\r\nchimpanzee, orang, and gibbon of to-day, and one is the group that will\r\nbecome man. To put it still more precisely, if we found a whole series\r\nof remains of man's ancestors during the Tertiary, we should probably\r\nclass them, broadly, as femur-remains in the Eocene, monkey-remains in\r\nthe Oligocene, and ape-remains in the Miocene. In that sense only man\r\n\"descends from a monkey.\"\r\n\r\nThe far more important question is: How did this one particular group of\r\nanthropoid animals of the Miocene come to surpass all its cousins, and\r\nall the rest of the mammals, in brain-development? Let us first rid the\r\nquestion of its supposed elements of mystery and make of it a simple\r\nproblem. Some imagine that a sudden and mysterious rise in intelligence\r\nlifted the progenitor of man above its fellows. The facts very quickly\r\ndispel this illusion. We may at least assume that the ancestor of man\r\nwas on a level with the anthropoid ape in the Miocene period, and we\r\nknow from their skulls that the apes were as advanced then as they are\r\nnow. But from the early Miocene to the Pleistocene is a stretch of\r\nabout a million years on the very lowest estimate. In other words,\r\nman occupied about a million years in travelling from the level of the\r\nchimpanzee to a level below that of the crudest savage ever discovered.\r\nIf we set aside the Java man, as a possible survivor of an earlier\r\nphase, we should still have to say that, much more than a million years\r\nafter his departure from the chimpanzee level, man had merely advanced\r\nfar enough to chip stone implements; because we find no other trace\r\nwhatever of intelligence than this until near the close of the\r\nPalaeolithic period. If there is any mystery, it is in the slowness of\r\nman's development.\r\n\r\nLet us further recollect that it is a common occurrence in the calendar\r\nof life for a particular organ to be especially developed in one\r\nmember of a particular group more than in the others. The trunk of the\r\nelephant, the neck of the giraffe, the limbs of the horse or deer, the\r\ncanines of the satire-toothed tiger, the wings of the bat, the colouring\r\nof the tiger, the horns of the deer, are so many examples in the mammal\r\nworld alone. The brain is a useful organ like any other, and it is easy\r\nto conceive that the circumstances of one group may select it just as\r\nthe environment of another group may lead to the selection of speed,\r\nweapons, or colouring. In fact, as we saw, there was so great and\r\ngeneral an evolution of brain in the Tertiary Era that our modern\r\nmammals quite commonly have many times the brain of their Tertiary\r\nancestors. Can we suggest any reasons why brain should be especially\r\ndeveloped in the apes, and more particularly still in the ancestors of\r\nman?\r\n\r\nThe Primate group generally is a race of tree-climbers. The appearance\r\nof fruit on early Tertiary trees and the multiplication of carnivores\r\nexplain this. The Primate is, except in a few robust cases, a\r\nparticularly defenceless animal. When its earliest ancestors came in\r\ncontact with fruit and nut-bearing trees, they developed climbing power\r\nand other means of defence and offense were sacrificed. Keenness of\r\nscent and range of hearing would now be of less moment, but sight would\r\nbe stimulated, especially when soft-footed climbing carnivores came on\r\nthe scene. There is, however, a much deeper significance in the adoption\r\nof climbing, and we must borrow a page from the modern physiology of the\r\nbrain to understand it.\r\n\r\nThe stress laid in the modern education of young children on the use of\r\nthe hands is not merely due to a feeling that they should handle objects\r\nas well as read about them. It is partly due to the belief of many\r\ndistinguished physiologists that the training of the hands has a direct\r\nstimulating effect on the thought-centres in the brain. The centre in\r\nthe cerebrum which controls the use of the hands is on the fringe of\r\nthe region which seems to be concerned in mental operations. For reasons\r\nwhich will appear presently, we may add that the centres for controlling\r\nthe muscles of the face and head are in the same region. Any finer\r\ntraining or the use of the hands will develop the centre for the fore\r\nlimbs, and, on the principles, may react on the more important region of\r\nthe cortex. Hence in turning the fore foot into a hand, for climbing\r\nand grasping purposes, the primitive Primate entered upon the path\r\nof brain-development. Even the earliest Primates show large brains in\r\ncomparison with the small brains of their contemporaries.\r\n\r\nIt is a familiar fact in the animal world that when a certain group\r\nenters upon a particular path of evolution, some members of the group\r\nadvance only a little way along it, some go farther, and some outstrip\r\nall the others. The development of social life among the bees will\r\nillustrate this. Hence we need not be puzzled by the fact that the\r\nlemurs have remained at one mental level, the monkeys at another, and\r\nthe apes at a third. It is the common experience of life; and it is\r\nespecially clear among the various races of men. A group becomes fitted\r\nto its environment, and, as long as its surroundings do not change, it\r\ndoes not advance. A related group, in a different environment, receives\r\na particular stimulation, and advances. If, moreover, a group remains\r\nunstimulated for ages, it may become so rigid in its type that it loses\r\nthe capacity to advance. It is generally believed that the lowest\r\nraces of men, and even some of the higher races like the Australian\r\naboriginals, are in this condition. We may expect this \"unteachability\"\r\nin a far more stubborn degree in the anthropoid apes, which have been\r\nadapted to an unchanging environment for a million years.\r\n\r\nAll that we need further suppose is--and it is one of the commonest\r\nepisodes in terrestrial life--that one branch of the Miocene\r\nanthropoids, which were spread over a large part of the earth, received\r\nsome stimulus to change which its cousins did not experience. It is\r\nsometimes suggested that social life was the great advantage which led\r\nto the superior development of mind in man. But such evidence as there\r\nis would lead us to suppose that primitive man was solitary, not social.\r\nThe anthropoid apes are not social, but live in families, and are very\r\nunprogressive. On the other hand, the earliest remains of prehistoric\r\nman give no indication of social life. Fire-places, workshops, caves,\r\netc., enter the story in a later phase. Some authorities on prehistoric\r\nman hold very strongly that during the greater part of the Old Stone\r\nAge (two-thirds, at least, of the human period) man wandered only in the\r\ncompany of his mate and children. [*]\r\n\r\n     * The point will be more fully discussed later. This account\r\n     of prehistoric life is well seen in Mortillet's\r\n     Prehistorique (1900). The lowest races also have no tribal\r\n     life, and Professor Westermarck is of opinion that early man\r\n     was not social.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe seem to have the most plausible explanation of the divergence of man\r\nfrom his anthropoid cousins in the fact that he left the trees of his\r\nand their ancestors. This theory has the advantage of being a fact--for\r\nthe Ape-Man race of Java has already left the trees--and providing a\r\nstrong ground for brain-advance. A dozen reasons might be imagined for\r\nhis quitting the trees--migration, for instance, to a region in\r\nwhich food was more abundant, and carnivores less formidable, on the\r\nground-level--but we will be content with the fact that he did. Such a\r\nchange would lead to a more consistent adoption of the upright attitude,\r\nwhich is partly found in the anthropoid apes, especially the gibbons.\r\nThe fore limb would be no longer a support of the body; the hand would\r\nbe used more for grasping; and the hand-centre in the brain would be\r\nproportionately stimulated. The adoption of the erect attitude would\r\nfurther lead to a special development of the muscles of the head and\r\nface, the centre for which is in the same important region in the\r\ncortex. There would also be a direct stimulation of the brain, as,\r\nhaving neither weapons nor speed, the animal would rely all the more on\r\nsight and mind. If we further suppose that this primitive being extended\r\nthe range of his hunting, from insects and small or dead birds to small\r\nland-animals, the stimulation would be all the greater. In a word, the\r\nvery fact of a change from the trees to the ground suggests a line of\r\nbrain-development which may plausibly be conceived, in the course of a\r\nmillion years, to evolve an Ape-Man out of a man-like ape. And we are\r\nnot introducing any imaginary factor in this view of human origins.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the evolution of man is often approached in a frame of\r\nmind not far removed from that of the educated, but inexpert, European\r\nwho stands before the lowly figure of the chimpanzee, and wonders by\r\nwhat miracle the gulf between it and himself was bridged. That is to lay\r\na superfluous strain on the imagination. The proper term of comparison\r\nis the lowest type of human being known to us, since the higher types of\r\nliving men have confessedly evolved from the lower. But even the lowest\r\ntype of existing or recent savage is not the lowest level of humanity.\r\nWhether or no the Tasmanian or the Yahgan is a primitive remnant of the\r\nOld Stone Age, we have a far lower depth in the Java race. What we have\r\nfirst to do is to explain the advance to that level, in the course of\r\nmany hundreds of thousands of years: a period fully a hundred times as\r\nlong as the whole history of civilisation. Time itself is no factor\r\nin evolution, but in this case it is a significant condition. It means\r\nthat, on this view of the evolution of man, we are merely assuming that\r\nan advance in brain-development took place between the Miocene and the\r\nPleistocene, not similar to, but immeasurably less than, the advance\r\nwhich we know to have been made in the last fifty thousand years. In\r\npoint of fact, the most mysterious feature of the evolution of man was\r\nits slowness. We shall see that, to meet the facts, we must suppose man\r\nto have made little or no progress during most of this vast period, and\r\nthen to have received some new stimulation to develop. What it was we\r\nhave now to inquire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. MAN AND THE GREAT ICE-AGE\r\n\r\nIn discussing the development of plants and animals during the Tertiary\r\nEra we have already perceived the shadow of the approaching Ice-Age.\r\nWe found that in the course of the Tertiary the types which were more\r\nsensitive to cold gradually receded southward, and before its close\r\nEurope, Asia, and North America presented a distinctly temperate aspect.\r\nThis is but the penumbra of the eclipse. When we pass the limits of\r\nthe Tertiary Era, and enter the Quaternary, the refrigeration steadily\r\nproceeds, and, from temperate, the aspect of much of Europe and North\r\nAmerica becomes arctic. From six to eight million square miles of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere are buried under fields of snow and ice, and even in\r\nthe southern regions smaller glacial sheets spread from the foot of the\r\nhigher ranges of mountains.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to-day to explain at any length the evidences by which\r\ngeologists trace this enormous glaciation of the northern hemisphere.\r\nThere are a few works still in circulation in which popular writers,\r\nrelying on the obstinacy of a few older geologists, speak lightly of the\r\n\"nightmare\" of the Ice-Age. But the age has gone by in which it could\r\nseriously be suggested that the boulders strewn along the east of\r\nScotland--fragments of rock whose home we must seek in Scandinavia--were\r\nbrought by the vikings as ballast for their ships. Even the more serious\r\ncontroversy, whether the scratches and the boulders which we find on the\r\nface of Northern Europe and America were due to floating or land ice,\r\nis virtually settled. Several decades of research have detected the\r\nunmistakable signs of glacial action over this vast area of the northern\r\nhemisphere. Most of Europe north of the Thames and the Danube, nearly\r\nall Canada and a very large part of the United States, and a somewhat\r\nless expanse of Northern Asia, bear to this day the deep scars of\r\nthe thick, moving ice-sheets. Exposed rock-surfaces are ground and\r\nscratched, beds of pebbles are twisted and contorted hollows are scooped\r\nout, and moraines--the rubbish-heaps of the glaciers--are found on every\r\nside. There is now not the least doubt that, where the great Deinosaurs\r\nhad floundered in semi-tropical swamps, where the figs and magnolias had\r\nlater flourished, where the most industrious and prosperous hives of\r\nmen are found to-day, there was, in the Pleistocene period, a country to\r\nwhich no parallel can be found outside the polar circles to-day.\r\n\r\nThe great revolution begins with the gathering of snows on the\r\nmountains. The Alps and Pyrenees had now, we saw, reached their full\r\nstature, and the gathering snows on their summits began to glide\r\ndown toward the plains in rivers of ice. The Apennines (and even the\r\nmountains of Corsica), the Balkans, Carpathians, Caucasus, and Ural\r\nMountains, shone in similar mantles of ice and snow. The mountains of\r\nWales, the north of England, Scotland, and Scandinavia had even heavier\r\nburdens, and, as the period advanced, their sluggish streams of\r\nice poured slowly over the plains. The trees struggled against the\r\nincreasing cold in the narrowing tracts of green; the animals died,\r\nmigrated to the south, or put on arctic coats. At length the ice-sheets\r\nof Scandinavia met the spreading sheets from Scotland and Wales, and\r\ncrept over Russia and Germany, and an almost continuous mantle, from\r\nwhich only a few large areas of arctic vegetation peeped out, was thrown\r\nover the greater part of Europe. Ten thousand feet thick where it left\r\nthe hills of Norway and Sweden, several thousand feet thick even in\r\nScotland, the ice-sheet that resulted from the fusion of the glaciers\r\ngradually thinned as it went south, and ended in an irregular fringe\r\nacross Central Europe. The continent at that time stretched westward\r\nbeyond the Hebrides and some two hundred miles beyond Ireland. The\r\nice-front followed this curve, casting icebergs into the Atlantic, then\r\nprobably advanced up what is now the Bristol Channel, and ran across\r\nEngland and Europe, in a broken line, from Bristol to Poland. South\r\nof this line there were smaller ice-fields round the higher mountains,\r\nnorth of it almost the whole country presented the appearance that we\r\nfind in Greenland to-day.\r\n\r\nIn North America the glaciation was even more extensive. About four\r\nmillion square miles of the present temperate zone were buried under ice\r\nand snow. From Greenland, Labrador, and the higher Canadian mountains\r\nthe glaciers poured south, until, in the east, the mass of ice\r\npenetrated as far as the valley of the Mississippi. The great lakes of\r\nNorth America are permanent memorials of its Ice-Age, and over more than\r\nhalf the country we trace the imprint and the relics of the sheet. South\r\nAmerica, Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand had their glaciated areas.\r\nNorth Asia was largely glaciated, but the range of the ice-sheet is not\r\nyet determined in that continent.\r\n\r\nThis summary statement will convey some idea of the extraordinary\r\nphase through which the earth passed in the early part of the present\r\ngeological era. But it must be added that a singular circumstance\r\nprolonged the glacial regime in the northern hemisphere. Modern\r\ngeologists speak rather of a series of successive ice-sheets than of one\r\ndefinite Ice-Age. Some, indeed, speak of a series of Ice-Ages, but we\r\nneed not discuss the verbal question. It is now beyond question that the\r\nice-sheet advanced and retreated several times during the Glacial Epoch.\r\nThe American and some English geologists distinguished six ice-sheets,\r\nwith five intermediate periods of more temperate climate. The German\r\nand many English and French geologists distinguish four sheets and\r\nthree interglacial epochs. The exact number does not concern us, but the\r\nrepeated spread of the ice is a point of some importance. The various\r\nsheets differed considerably in extent. The wide range of the ice which\r\nI have described represents the greatest extension of the glaciation,\r\nand probably corresponds to the second or third of the six advances in\r\nDr. Geikie's (and the American) classification.\r\n\r\nBefore we consider the biological effect of this great of refrigeration\r\nof the globe, we must endeavour to understand the occurrence itself.\r\nHere we enter a world of controversy, but a few suggestions at least may\r\nbe gathered from the large literature of the subject, which dispel much\r\nof the mystery of the Great Ice-Age.\r\n\r\nIt was at one time customary to look out beyond the earth itself for the\r\nultimate causes of this glaciation. Imagine the sheet of ice, which now\r\nspreads widely round the North Pole, shifted to another position on\r\nthe surface of the planet, and you have a simple explanation of the\r\noccurrence. In other words, if we suppose that the axis of the earth\r\ndoes not consistently point in one direction--that the great ball does\r\nnot always present the same average angle in relation to the sun--the\r\npoles will not always be where they are at present, and the Pleistocene\r\nIce-Age may represent a time when the north pole was in the latitude\r\nof North Europe and North America. This opinion had to be abandoned. We\r\nhave no trace whatever of such a constant shifting of the polar regions\r\nas it supposes, and, especially, we have no trace that the warm zone\r\ncorrespondingly shifted in the Pleistocene.\r\n\r\nA much more elaborate theory was advanced by Dr. Croll, and is still\r\nentertained by many. The path of the earth round the sun is not\r\ncircular, but elliptical, and there are times when the gravitational\r\npull of the other planets increases the eccentricity of the orbit. It\r\nwas assumed that there are periods of great length, separated from each\r\nother by still longer periods, when this eccentricity of the orbit\r\nis greatly exaggerated. The effect would be to prolong the winter and\r\nshorten the summer of each hemisphere in turn. The total amount of heat\r\nreceived would not alter, but there would be a long winter with less\r\nheat per hour, and a short summer with more heat. The short summer would\r\nnot suffice to melt the enormous winter accumulations of ice and snow,\r\nand an ice-age would result. To this theory, again, it is objected that\r\nwe do not find the regular succession of ice-ages in the story of the\r\nearth which the theory demands, and that there is no evidence of an\r\nalternation of the ice between the northern and southern hemispheres.\r\n\r\nMore recent writers have appealed to the sun itself, and supposed that\r\nsome prolonged veiling of its photosphere greatly reduced the amount of\r\nheat emitted by it. More recently still it has been suggested that an\r\naccumulation of cosmic or meteoric dust in our atmosphere, or between\r\nus and the sun, had, for a prolonged period, the effect of a colossal\r\n\"fire-screen.\" Neither of these suppositions would explain the\r\nlocalisation of the ice. In any case we need not have recourse to purely\r\nspeculative accidents in the world beyond until it is clear that there\r\nwere no changes in the earth itself which afford some explanation.\r\n\r\nThis is by no means clear. Some writers appeal to changes in the ocean\r\ncurrents. It is certain that a change in the course of the cold and\r\nwarm currents of the ocean to-day might cause very extensive changes\r\nof climate, but there seems to be some confusion of ideas in suggesting\r\nthat this might have had an equal, or even greater, influence in former\r\ntimes. Our ocean currents differ so much in temperature because the\r\nearth is now divided into very pronounced zones of climate. These zones\r\ndid not exist before the Pliocene period, and it is not at all clear\r\nthat any redistribution of currents in earlier times could have had such\r\nremarkable consequences. The same difficulty applies to wind-currents.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we have already, in discussing the Permian\r\nglaciation, discovered two agencies which are very effective in lowering\r\nthe temperature of the earth. One is the rise of the land; the other is\r\nthe thinning of the atmosphere. These are closely related agencies, and\r\nwe found them acting in conjunction to bring about the Permian Ice-Age.\r\nDo we find them at work in the Pleistocene?\r\n\r\nIt is not disputed that there was a very considerable upheaval of the\r\nland, especially in Europe and North America, at the end of the Tertiary\r\nEra. Every mountain chain advanced, and our Alps, Pyrenees, Himalaya,\r\netc., attained, for the first time, their present, or an even greater\r\nelevation. The most critical geologists admit that Europe, as a whole,\r\nrose 4000 feet above its earlier level. Such an elevation would be bound\r\nto involve a great lowering of the temperature. The geniality of the\r\nOligocene period was due, like that of the earlier warm periods, to the\r\nlow-lying land and very extensive water-surface. These conditions were\r\nrevolutionised before the end of the Tertiary. Great mountains towered\r\ninto the snow-line, and vast areas were elevated which had formerly been\r\nsea or swamp.\r\n\r\nThis rise of the land involved a great decrease in the proportion of\r\nmoisture in the atmosphere. The sea surface was enormously lessened, and\r\nthe mountains would now condense the moisture into snow or cloud to a\r\nvastly greater extent than had ever been known before There would also\r\nbe a more active circulation of the atmosphere, the moist warm winds\r\nrushing upward towards the colder elevations and parting with their\r\nvapour. As the proportion of moisture in the atmosphere lessened\r\nthe surface-heat would escape more freely into space, the general\r\ntemperature would fall, and the evaporation--or production of moisture\r\nwould be checked, while the condensation would continue. The prolonging\r\nof such conditions during a geological period can be understood to have\r\ncaused the accumulation of fields of snow and ice in the higher regions.\r\nIt seems further probable that these conditions would lead to a very\r\nconsiderable formation of fog and cloud, and under this protecting\r\ncanopy the glaciers would creep further down toward the plains.\r\n\r\nWe have then to consider the possibility of a reduction of the quantity\r\nof carbon-dioxide in the atmosphere The inexpert reader probably has a\r\nvery exaggerated idea of the fall in temperature that would be required\r\nto give Europe an Ice-Age. If our average temperature fell about 5-8\r\ndegrees C. below the average temperature of our time it would suffice;\r\nand it is further calculated that if the quantity of carbon-dioxide in\r\nour atmosphere were reduced by half, we should have this required fall\r\nin temperature. So great a reduction would not be necessary in view\r\nof the other refrigerating agencies. Now it is quite certain that the\r\nproportion of carbon-dioxide was greatly reduced in the Pleistocene. The\r\nforests of the Tertiary Era would steadily reduce it, but the extensive\r\nupheaval of the land at its close would be even more important. The\r\nnewly exposed surfaces would absorb great quantities of carbon. The\r\nocean, also, as it became colder, would absorb larger and larger\r\nquantities of carbon-dioxide. Thus the Pleistocene atmosphere, gradually\r\nrelieved of its vapours and carbon-dioxide, would no longer retain\r\nthe heat at the surface. We may add that the growth of reflective\r\nsurfaces--ice, snow, cloud, etc.--would further lessen the amount of\r\nheat received from the sun.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have a series of closely related causes and effects\r\nwhich would go far toward explaining, if they do not wholly suffice to\r\nexplain, the general fall of the earth's temperature. The basic cause is\r\nthe upheaval of the land--a fact which is beyond controversy, the other\r\nagencies are very plain and recognisable consequences of the upheaval.\r\nThere are, however, many geologists who do not think this explanation\r\nadequate.\r\n\r\nIt is pointed out, in the first place, that the glaciation seems to\r\nhave come long after the elevation. The difficulty does not seem to\r\nbe insurmountable. The reduction of the atmospheric vapour would be\r\na gradual process, beginning with the later part of the elevation and\r\nculminating long afterwards. The reduction of the carbon-dioxide would\r\nbe even more gradual. It is impossible to say how long it would take\r\nthese processes to reach a very effective stage, but it is equally\r\nimpossible to show that the interval between the upheaval and the\r\nglaciation is greater than the theory demands.\r\n\r\nIt is also said that we cannot on these principles understand the\r\nrepeated advance and retreat of the ice-sheet.\r\n\r\nThis objection, again, seems to fail. It is an established fact that\r\nthe land sank very considerably during the Ice-Age, and has risen again\r\nsince the ice disappeared. We find that the crust in places sank so low\r\nthat an arctic ocean bathed the slopes of some of the Welsh mountains;\r\nand American geologists say that their land has risen in places from\r\n2000 to 3000 feet (Chamberlin) since the burden of ice was lifted from\r\nit. Here we have the possibility of an explanation of the advances and\r\nretreats of the glaciers. The refrigerating agencies would proceed\r\nuntil an enormous burden of ice was laid on the land of the northern\r\nhemisphere. The land apparently sank under the burden, the ice and snow\r\nmelted at the lower level and there was a temperate interglacial period.\r\nBut the land, relieved of its burden, rose once more, the exposed\r\nsurface absorbed further quantities of carbon, and a fresh period of\r\nrefrigeration opened. This oscillation might continue until the two sets\r\nof opposing forces were adjusted, and the crust reached a condition of\r\ncomparative stability.\r\n\r\nFinally, and this is the more serious difficulty, it is said that we\r\ncannot in this way explain the localisation of the glacial sheets. Why\r\nshould Europe and North America in particular suffer so markedly from\r\na general thinning of the atmosphere? The simplest answer is to suggest\r\nthat they especially shared the rise of the land. Geology is not in\r\na position either to prove or disprove this, and it remains only a\r\nspeculative interpretation of the fact We know at least that there was\r\na great uprise of land in Europe and North America in the Pliocene and\r\nPleistocene and may leave the precise determination of the point to a\r\nlater age. At the same time other local causes are not excluded. There\r\nmay have been a large extension of the area of atmospheric depression\r\nwhich we have in the region of Greenland to-day.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the question of chronology we have the same acute\r\ndifference of opinion as we have found in regard to all questions of\r\ngeological time. It used to be urged, on astronomical grounds, that the\r\nIce-Age began about 240,000 years ago, and ended about 60,000 years\r\nago, but the astronomical theory is, as I said, generally abandoned.\r\nGeologists, on the other hand, find it difficult to give even\r\napproximate figures. Reviewing the various methods of calculation,\r\nProfessor Chamberlin concludes that the time of the first spread of the\r\nice-sheet is quite unknown, the second and greatest extension of the\r\nglaciation may have been between 300,000 and a million years ago, and\r\nthe last ice-extension from 20,000 to 60,000 years ago; but he himself\r\nattaches \"very little value\" to the figures. The chief ice-age was some\r\nhundreds of thousands of years ago, that is all we can say with any\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nIn dismissing the question of climate, however, we should note that a\r\nvery serious problem remains unsolved. As far as present evidence\r\ngoes we seem to be free to hold that the ice-ages which have at long\r\nintervals invaded the chronicle of the earth were due to rises of the\r\nland. Upheaval is the one constant and clearly recognisable feature\r\nassociated with, or preceding, ice-ages. We saw this in the case of the\r\nCambrian, Permian, Eocene, and Pleistocene periods of cold, and may add\r\nthat there are traces of a rise of mountains before the glaciation\r\nof which we find traces in the middle of the Archaean Era. There are\r\nproblems still to be solved in connection with each of these very\r\nimportant ages, but in the rise of the land and consequent thinning of\r\nthe atmosphere we seem to have a general clue to their occurrence. Apart\r\nfrom these special periods of cold, however, we have seen that there has\r\nbeen, in recent geological times, a progressive cooling of the earth,\r\nwhich we have not explained. Winter seems now to be a permanent feature\r\nof the earth's life, and polar caps are another recent, and apparently\r\npermanent, acquisition. I find no plausible reason assigned for this.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion that the disk of the sun is appreciably smaller since\r\nTertiary days is absurd; and the idea that the earth has only recently\r\nceased to allow its internal heat to leak through the crust is hardly\r\nmore plausible. The cause remains to be discovered.\r\n\r\nWe turn now to consider the effect of the great Ice-Age, and the\r\nrelation of man to it. The Permian revolution, to which the Pleistocene\r\nIce-Age comes nearest in importance, wrought such devastation that the\r\noverwhelming majority of living things perished. Do we find a\r\nsimilar destruction of life, and selection of higher types, after the\r\nPleistocene perturbation? In particular, had it any appreciable effect\r\nupon the human species?\r\n\r\nA full description of the effect of the great Ice-Age would occupy\r\na volume. The modern landscape in Europe and North America was very\r\nlargely carved and modelled by the ice-sheet and the floods that ensued\r\nupon its melting. Hills were rounded, valleys carved, lakes formed,\r\ngravels and soils distributed, as we find them to-day. In its vegetal\r\naspect, also, as we saw, the modern landscape was determined by the\r\nPleistocene revolution. A great scythe slowly passed over the land. When\r\nthe ice and snow had ended, and the trees and flowers, crowded in the\r\nsouthern area, slowly spread once more over the virgin soil, it was only\r\nthe temperate species that could pass the zone guarded by the Alps and\r\nthe Pyrenees. On the Alps themselves the Pleistocene population still\r\nlingers, their successful adaptation to the cold now preventing them\r\nfrom descending to the plains.\r\n\r\nThe animal world in turn was winnowed by the Pleistocene episode. The\r\nhippopotamus, crocodile, turtle, flamingo, and other warm-loving animals\r\nwere banished to the warm zone. The mammoth and the rhinoceros met the\r\ncold by developing woolly coats, but the disappearance of the ice, which\r\nhad tempted them to this departure, seems to have ended their fitness.\r\nOther animals which became adapted to the cold--arctic bears, foxes,\r\nseals, etc.--have retreated north with the ice, as the sheet melted.\r\nFor hundreds of thousands of years Europe and North America, with their\r\nalternating glacial and interglacial periods, witnessed extraordinary\r\nchanges and minglings of their animal population. At one time\r\nthe reindeer, the mammoth, and the glutton penetrate down to the\r\nMediterranean, in the next phase the elephant and hippopotamus again\r\nadvance nearly to Central Europe. It is impossible here to attempt\r\nto unravel these successive changes and migrations. Great numbers of\r\nspecies were destroyed, and at length, when the climatic condition\r\nof the earth reached a state of comparative stability, the surviving\r\nanimals settled in the geographical regions in which we find them\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nThe only question into which we may enter with any fullness is that\r\nof the relation of human development to this grave perturbation of the\r\ncondition of the globe. The problem is sometimes wrongly conceived. The\r\nchief point to be determined is not whether man did or did not precede\r\nthe Ice-Age. As it is the general belief that he was evolved in the\r\nTertiary, it is clear that he existed in some part of the earth before\r\nthe Ice-Age. Whether he had already penetrated as far north as Britain\r\nand Belgium is an interesting point, but not one of great importance.\r\nWe may, therefore, refrain from discussing at any length those disputed\r\ncrude stone implements (Eoliths) which, in the opinion of many, prove\r\nhis presence in northern regions before the close of the Tertiary.\r\nWe may also now disregard the remains of the Java Ape-Man. There are\r\nauthorities, such as Deniker, who hold that even the latest research\r\nshows these remains to be Pliocene, but it is disputed. The Java race\r\nmay be a surviving remnant of an earlier phase of human evolution.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting subject for inquiry is the fortune of our human and\r\nprehuman forerunners during the Pliocene and Pleistocene periods. It may\r\nseem that if we set aside the disputable evidence of the Eoliths and the\r\nJava remains we can say nothing whatever on this subject. In reality a\r\nfact of very great interest can be established. It can be shown that\r\nthe progress made during this enormous lapse of time--at least a million\r\nyears--was remarkably slow. Instead of supposing that some extraordinary\r\nevolution took place in that conveniently obscure past, to which we can\r\nfind no parallel within known times, it is precisely the reverse.\r\nThe advance that has taken place within the historical period is far\r\ngreater, comparatively to the span of time, than that which took place\r\nin the past.\r\n\r\nTo make this interesting fact clearer we must attempt to measure the\r\nprogress made in the Pliocene and Pleistocene. We may assume that the\r\nprecursor of man had arrived at the anthropoid-ape level by the middle\r\nof the Miocene period. He is not at all likely to have been behind\r\nthe anthropoid apes, and we saw that they were well developed in the\r\nmid-Tertiary. Now we have a good knowledge of man as he was in the\r\nlater stage of the Ice-Age--at least a million years later--and may thus\r\ninstitute a useful comparison and form some idea of the advance made.\r\n\r\nIn the later stages of the Pleistocene a race of men lived in Europe of\r\nwhom we have a number of skulls and skeletons, besides vast numbers of\r\nstone implements. It is usually known as the Neanderthal race, as the\r\nfirst skeleton was found, in 1856, at Neanderthal, near Dusseldorf.\r\nFurther skeletons were found at Spy, in Belgium, and Krapina, in\r\nCroatia. A skull formerly found at Gibraltar is now assigned to the same\r\nrace. In the last five years a jaw of the same (or an earlier) age has\r\nbeen found at Mauer, near Heidelberg, and several skeletons have been\r\nfound in France (La Vezere and Chapelle-aux-Saints). From these, and a\r\nfew earlier fragments, we have a confident knowledge of the features of\r\nthis early human race.\r\n\r\nThe highest appreciation of the Neanderthal man--a somewhat flattering\r\nappreciation, as we shall see--is that he had reached the level of the\r\nAustralian black of to-day. The massive frontal ridges over his eyes,\r\nthe very low, retreating forehead, the throwing of the mass of the brain\r\ntoward the back of the head, the outthrust of the teeth and jaws, and\r\nthe complete absence (in some cases) or very slight development of\r\nthe chin, combine to give the head what the leading authorities call\r\na \"bestial\" or \"simian\" aspect. The frame is heavy, powerful, and of\r\nmoderate height (usually from two to four inches over five feet). The\r\nthigh-bones are much more curved than in modern man. We cannot enter\r\nhere into finer anatomical details, but all the features are consistent\r\nand indicate a stage in the evolution from ape-man to savage man.\r\n\r\nOne point only calls for closer inquiry. Until a year or two ago it was\r\ncustomary to state that in cranial capacity also--that is to say, in\r\nthe volume of brain-matter that the skull might contain--the Neanderthal\r\nrace was intermediate between the Ape-Man and modern man. We saw\r\nabove that the cranial capacity of the highest ape is about 600 cubic\r\ncentimetres, and that of the Ape-Man (variously given as 850 and 950) is\r\nabout 900. It was then added that the capacity of the Neanderthal race\r\nwas about 1200, and that of civilised man (on the average) 1600. This\r\nseemed to be an effective and convincing indication of evolution, but\r\nrecent writers have seriously criticised it. Sir Edwin Ray Lankester,\r\nProfessor Sollas, and Dr. Keith have claimed in recent publications that\r\nthe brain of Neanderthal man was as large as, if not larger than, that\r\nof modern man. [*] Professor Sollas even observes that \"the brain increases\r\nin volume as we go backward.\" This is, apparently, so serious a reversal\r\nof the familiar statement in regard to the evolution of man that we must\r\nconsider it carefully.\r\n\r\n     *See especially an address by Professor Sollas in the\r\n     Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, Vol. LXVI.\r\n     (1910).\r\n\r\n\r\nLargeness of brain in an individual is no indication of intelligence,\r\nand smallness of brain no proof of low mentality. Some of the greatest\r\nthinkers, such as Aristotle and Leibnitz, had abnormally small heads.\r\nFurther, the size of the brain is of no significance whatever except in\r\nstrict relation to the size and weight of the body. Woman has five or\r\nsix ounces less brain-matter than man, but in proportion to her average\r\nsize and the weight of the vital tissue of her body (excluding fat) she\r\nhas as respectable a brain as man. When, however, these allowances have\r\nbeen made, it has usually been considered that the average brain of a\r\nrace is in proportion to its average intelligence. This is not strictly\r\ntrue. The rabbit has a larger proportion of brain to body than\r\nthe elephant or horse, and the canary a larger proportion than the\r\nchimpanzee. Professor Sollas says that the average cranial capacity of\r\nthe Eskimo is 1546 cubic centimetres, or nearly that assigned to the\r\naverage Parisian.\r\n\r\nClearly the question is very complex, and some of these recent\r\nauthorities conclude that the cranial capacity, or volume of the\r\nbrain, has no relation to intelligence, and therefore the size of the\r\nNeanderthal skull neither confirms nor disturbs the theory of evolution.\r\nThe wise man will suspend his judgment until the whole question has\r\nbeen fully reconsidered. But I would point out that some of the\r\nrecent criticisms are exaggerated. The Gibraltar skull is estimated\r\nby Professor Sollas himself to have a capacity of about 1260; and his\r\nconclusion that it is an abnormal or feminine skull rests on no positive\r\ngrounds. The Chapelle-aux-Saints skull ALONE is proved to have the high\r\ncapacity of 1620; and it is as yet not much more than a supposition that\r\nthe earlier skulls had been wrongly measured. But, further, the\r\ngreat French authority, M. Boule, who measured the capacity of the\r\nChapelle-aux Saints skull, observes [*] that \"the anomaly disappears\" on\r\ncareful study. He assures us that a modern skull of the same dimensions\r\nwould have a capacity of 1800-1900 cubic centimetres, and warns us that\r\nwe must take into account the robustness of the body of primitive man.\r\nHe concludes that the real volume of the Neanderthal brain (in this\r\nhighest known specimen) is \"slight in comparison with the volume of the\r\nbrain lodged in the large heads of to-day,\" and that the \"bestial or\r\nape-like characters\" of the race are not neutralised by this gross\r\nmeasurement.\r\n\r\n     *See his article in Anthropologie, Vol. XX. (1909), p. 257.\r\n     As Professor Sollas mainly relies on Boule, it is important\r\n     to see that there is a very great difference between the\r\n     two.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must therefore hesitate to accept the statement that primitive man\r\nhad as large a brain, if not a larger brain, than a modern race. The\r\nbasis is slender, and the proportion of brain to body-tissue has not\r\nbeen taken into account. On the other hand, the remains of this early\r\nrace are, Professor Sollas says, \"obviously more brutal than existing\r\nmen in all the other ascertainable characters by which they differ from\r\nthem.\" Nor are we confined to precarious measurements of skulls. We have\r\nthe remains of the culture of this early race, and in them we have a\r\nsurer trace of its mental development.\r\n\r\nHere again we must proceed with caution, and set aside confused and\r\nexaggerated statements. Some refer us to the artistic work of primitive\r\nman. We will consider his drawings and carvings presently, but they\r\nbelong to a later race, not the Neanderthal race. Some lay stress on\r\nthe fact, apparently indicated in one or two cases out of a dozen, that\r\nprimitive man buried his dead. Professor Sollas says that it indicates\r\nthat even Neanderthal man had reached \"a comparatively high stage in the\r\nevolution of religious ideas \"; but the Australians bury their dead,\r\nand the highest authorities are not agreed whether they have any idea\r\nwhatever of a supreme being or of morality. We must also disallow\r\nappeals to the use of fire, the taming of animals, pottery, or\r\nclothing. None of these things are clearly found in conjunction with the\r\nNeanderthal race.\r\n\r\nThe only certain relic of Neanderthal culture is the implement which the\r\nprimitive savage fashioned, by chipping or pressure, of flint or other\r\nhard stone. The fineness of some of these implements is no indication of\r\ngreat intelligence. The Neanderthal man inherited a stone culture which\r\nwas already of great antiquity. At least one, if not two or three,\r\nprolonged phases of the Old Stone Age were already over when he\r\nappeared. On the most modest estimate men had by that time been chipping\r\nflints for several hundred thousand years, and it is no argument of\r\ngeneral intelligence that some skill in the one industry of the age had\r\nbeen developed. The true measure of Neanderthal man's capacity is that,\r\na million years or so after passing the anthropoid-age level, he chipped\r\nhis stones more finely and gave them a better edge and contour. There\r\nis no evidence that he as yet hefted them. It is flattering to him to\r\ncompare him with the Australian aboriginal. The native art, the shields\r\nand spears and boomerangs, and the elaborate tribal and matrimonial\r\narrangements of the Australian black are not known to have had any\r\ncounterpart in his life.\r\n\r\nIt would therefore seem that the precursors of man made singularly\r\nlittle, if any, progress during the vast span of time between the\r\nMiocene and the Ice-Age, and that then something occurred which\r\nquickened the face of human evolution. From the Neanderthal level man\r\nwill advance to the height of modern civilisation in about one-tenth\r\nthe time that it took him to advance from the level of the higher ape to\r\nthat of the lowest savage. Something has broken into the long lethargy\r\nof his primitive career, and set him upon a progressive path. Let us see\r\nif a careful review of the stages of his culture confirms the\r\nnatural supposition that this \"something\" was the fall in the earth's\r\ntemperature, and how it may have affected him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. THE DAWN OF CIVILISATION\r\n\r\nThe story of man before the discovery of metal and the attainment of\r\ncivilisation is notoriously divided into a Palaeolithic (Old Stone) Age,\r\nand a Neolithic (New Stone) Age. Each of these ages is now subdivided\r\ninto stages, which we will review in succession. But it is important\r\nto conceive the whole story of man in more correct proportion than this\r\nfamiliar division suggests. The historical or civilised period is now\r\ncomputed at about ten thousand years. The Neolithic Age, which preceded\r\ncivilisation, is usually believed to be about four or five times as\r\nlong, though estimates of its duration vary from about twenty to a\r\nhundred thousand years. The Palaeolithic Age in turn is regarded as at\r\nleast three or four times as long as the Neolithic; estimates of time\r\nvary from a hundred to five hundred thousand years. And before this\r\nthere is the vast stretch of time in which the ape slowly became a\r\nprimitive human.\r\n\r\nThis long, early period is, as we saw, still wrapped in mist and\r\ncontroversy. A few bones tell of a race living, in semi-human shape, in\r\nthe region of the Indian Ocean; a few crude stones are held by many to\r\nindicate that a more advanced, but very lowly race, wandered over the\r\nsouth of Europe and north of Africa before the Ice-Age set in. The\r\nstarting-point or cradle of the race is not known. The old idea of\r\nseeking the patriarchal home on the plains to the north of India is\r\nabandoned, and there is some tendency to locate it in the land which has\r\npartly survived in the islands of the Indian Ocean. The finding of early\r\nremains in Java is not enough to justify that conclusion, but it obtains\r\na certain probability when we notice the geographical distribution of\r\nthe Primates. The femurs and the apes are found to-day in Africa and\r\nAsia alone; the monkeys have spread eastward to America and westward to\r\nEurope and Africa; the human race has spread north-eastward into Asia\r\nand America, northwestward into Europe, westward into Africa, and\r\nsouthward to Australia and the islands. This distribution suggests\r\na centre in the Indian Ocean, where there was much more land in the\r\nTertiary Era than there is now. We await further exploration in that\r\nregion and Africa.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing improbable in the supposition that man wandered into\r\nEurope in the Tertiary, and has left in the Eoliths the memorials of his\r\nlowly condition. The anthropoid apes certainly reached France. However\r\nthat may be, the Ice-Age would restrict all the Primates to the south.\r\nIt will be seen, on a glance at the map, that a line of ice-clad\r\nmountains would set a stern barrier to man's advance in the early\r\nPleistocene, from the Pyrenees to the Himalaya, if not to the Pacific.\r\nHe therefore spread westward and southward. One branch wandered into\r\nAustralia, and was afterwards pressed by more advanced invaders (the\r\npresent blacks of Australia) into Tasmania, which seems to have been\r\nstill connected by land. Another branch, or branches, spread into\r\nAfrica, to be driven southward, or into the central forests, by later\r\nand better equipped invaders. They survive, little changed (except by\r\nrecent contact with Europeans), in the Bushmen and in large populations\r\nof Central Africa which are below the level of tribal organisation.\r\nOthers remained in the islands, and we seem to have remnants of them\r\nin the Kalangs, Veddahs, etc. But these islands have been repeatedly\r\noverrun by higher races, and the primitive life has been modified.\r\n\r\nComparing the most isolated of these relics of early humanity, we obtain\r\nmany suggestions about the life of that remote age. The aboriginal\r\nTasmanians, who died out about forty years ago, were of great\r\nevolutionary interest. It is sometimes said that man is distinguished\r\nfrom all other animals by the possession of abstract ideas, but the very\r\nimperfect speech of the Tasmanians expressed no abstract ideas. Their\r\nmind seems to have been in an intermediate stage of development. They\r\nnever made fire, and, like the other surviving fragments of early\r\nhumanity, they had no tribal organisation, and no ideas of religion or\r\nmorality.\r\n\r\nThe first effect of the Ice-Age on this primitive humanity would be to\r\nlead to a beginning of the development of racial characters. The pigment\r\nunder the skin of the negro is a protection against the actinic rays\r\nof the tropical sun; the white man, with his fair hair and eyes, is a\r\nbleached product of the northern regions; and the yellow or brown skin\r\nseems to be the outcome of living in dry regions with great extremes\r\nof temperature. As the northern hemisphere divided into climatic zones\r\nthese physical characters were bound to develop. The men who went\r\nsouthward developed, especially when fully exposed to the sun on open\r\nplains, the layer of black pigment which marks the negroid type. There\r\nis good reason, as we shall see to think that man did not yet wear\r\nclothing, though he had a fairly conspicuous, if dwindling, coat\r\nof hair. On the other hand the men who lingered further north, in\r\nSouth-western Asia and North Africa, would lose what pigment they\r\nhad, and develop the lighter characters of the northerner. It has been\r\nnoticed that even a year in the arctic circle has a tendency to make\r\nthe eyes of explorers light blue. We may look for the genesis of\r\nthe vigorous, light-complexioned races along the fringe of the great\r\nice-sheet. It must be remembered that when the limit of the ice-sheet\r\nwas in Central Germany and Belgium, the climate even of North Africa\r\nwould be very much more temperate than it is to-day.\r\n\r\nAs the ice-sheet melted, the men who were adapted to living in the\r\ntemperate zone to the south of it penetrated into Europe, and the long\r\nstory of the Old Stone Age opened. It must not, of course, be supposed\r\nthat this stage of human culture only began with the invasion of Europe.\r\nMen would bring their rough art of fashioning implements with them, but\r\nthe southern regions are too little explored to inform us of the earlier\r\nstage. But as man enters Europe he begins to drop his flints on a soil\r\nthat we have constant occasion to probe--although the floor on which\r\nhe trod is now sometimes forty or fifty feet below the surface--and we\r\nobtain a surer glimpse of the fortunes of our race.\r\n\r\nMost European geologists count four distinct extensions of the\r\nice-sheet, with three interglacial periods. It is now generally believed\r\nthat man came north in the third interglacial period; though some high\r\nauthorities think that he came in the second. As far as England is\r\nconcerned, it has been determined, under the auspices of the British\r\nAssociation, that our oldest implements (apart from the Eoliths) are\r\nlater than the great ice-sheet, but there is some evidence that they\r\nprecede the last extension of the ice.\r\n\r\nTwo stages are distinguished in this first part of the Palaeolithic\r\nAge--the Acheulean and Chellean--but it will suffice for our purpose to\r\ntake the two together as the earlier and longer section of the Old Stone\r\nAge. It was a time of temperate, if not genial, climate. The elephant\r\n(an extinct type), the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, the hyaena, and\r\nmany other forms of animal life that have since retired southward, were\r\nneighbours of the first human inhabitant of Europe. Unfortunately, we\r\nhave only one bone of this primitive race, the jaw found at Mauer in\r\n1907, but its massive size and chinless contour suggest a being midway\r\nbetween the Java man and the Neanderthal race. His culture confirms the\r\nsupposition. There is at this stage no clear trace of fire, clothing,\r\narrows, hefted weapons, spears, or social life. As the implements are\r\ngenerally found on old river-banks or the open soil, not in caves, we\r\nseem to see a squat and powerful race wandering, homeless and unclad,\r\nby the streams and broad, marshy rivers of the time. The Thames and the\r\nSeine had not yet scooped out the valleys on the slopes of which London\r\nand Paris are built.\r\n\r\nThis period seems, from the vast number of stone implements referred to\r\nit, to have lasted a considerable time. There is a risk in venturing to\r\ngive figures, but it may be said that few authorities would estimate it\r\nat less than a hundred thousand years. Man still advanced with very\r\nslow and uncertain steps, his whole progress in that vast period being\r\nmeasured by the invention of one or two new forms of stone implements\r\nand a little more skill in chipping them. At its close a great\r\nchill comes over Europe--the last ice-sheet is, it seems, spreading\r\nsouthward--and we enter the Mousterian period and encounter the\r\nNeanderthal race which we described in the preceding chapter.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that the whole culture of primitive times is\r\ncrushed into a few feet of earth. The anthropologist is therefore quite\r\nunable to show us the real succession of human stages, and has to be\r\ncontent with a division of the whole long and gradual evolution into a\r\nfew well-marked phases. These phases, however, shade into each other,\r\nand are merely convenient measurements of a continuous story. The\r\nChellean man has slowly advanced to a high level. There is no sudden\r\nincoming of a higher culture or higher type of man. The most impressive\r\nrelics of the Mousterian period, which represent its later epoch, are\r\nmerely finely chipped implements. There is no art as yet, no pottery,\r\nand no agriculture; and there is no clear trace of the use of fire or\r\nclothing, though we should be disposed to put these inventions in the\r\nchilly and damp Mousterian period. There is therefore no ground for\r\nresenting the description, \"the primeval savage,\" which has been applied\r\nto early man. The human race is already old, yet, as we saw, it is\r\nhardly up to the level of the Australian black. The skeleton found at\r\nChapelle-aux-Saints is regarded as the highest known type of the race,\r\nyet the greatest authority on it, M. Boule, says emphatically: \"In no\r\nactual race do we find the characters of inferiority--that is to say,\r\nthe ape-like features--which we find in the Chapelle-aux-Saints head.\"\r\nThe largeness of the head is in proportion to the robust frame, but\r\nin its specifically human part--the front--it is very low and bestial;\r\nwhile the heavy ridges over the large eyes, the large flat stumpy nose,\r\nthe thick bulge of the lips and teeth, and the almost chinless jaw, show\r\nthat the traces of his ancestry cling close to man after some hundreds\r\nof thousands of years of development.\r\n\r\nThe cold increases as we pass to the last part of the Old Stone Age, the\r\nSolutrean and Magdalenian periods; and nothing is clearer than that the\r\npace of development increases at the same time. Short as the period is,\r\nin comparison with the preceding, it witnesses a far greater advance\r\nthan had been made in all the rest of the Old Stone Age. Beyond a doubt\r\nmen now live in caves, in large social groups, make clothing from the\r\nskins of animals, have the use of fire, and greatly improve the quality\r\nof their stone axes, scrapers, knives, and lance-heads. There is at\r\nlast some promise of the civilisation that is coming. In the soil of\r\nthe caverns in which man lived, especially in Southern France and the\r\nPyrenean region, we find the debris of a much larger and fuller life.\r\nEven the fine bone needles with which primitive man sewed his skin\r\ngarments, probably with sinews for thread, survive in scores. In other\r\nplaces we find the ashes of the fires round which he squatted, often\r\nassociated with the bones of the wild horses, deer, etc., on which he\r\nlived.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable indication of progress in the \"cave-man\" is his\r\nartistic skill. Exaggerated conclusions are sometimes drawn from the\r\nstatuettes, carvings, and drawings which we find among the remains of\r\nMagdalenian life. Most of them are crude, and have the limitations of a\r\nrustic or a child artist. There is no perspective, no grouping. Animals\r\nare jumbled together, and often left unfinished because the available\r\nspace was not measured. There are, however, some drawings--cut on bone\r\nor horn or stone with a flint implement--which evince great skill in\r\nline-drawing and, in a few cases, in composition. Some of the caves\r\nalso are more or less frescoed; the outlines of animals, sometimes of\r\nlife-size and in great numbers, are cut in the wall, and often filled in\r\nwith pigment. This skill does not imply any greater general intelligence\r\nthan the rest of the culture exhibits. It implies persistent and\r\ntraditional concentration upon the new artistic life. The men who drew\r\nthe \"reindeer of Thayngen\" and carved the remarkable statuettes of women\r\nin ivory or stone, were ignorant of the simplest rudiments of pottery or\r\nagriculture, which many savage tribes possess.\r\n\r\nSome writers compare them with the Eskimo of to-day, and even suggest\r\nthat the Eskimo are the survivors of the race, retreating northward with\r\nthe last ice-sheet, and possibly egged onward by a superior race from\r\nthe south. It is, perhaps, not a very extravagant claim that some\r\nhundreds of thousands of years of development--we are now only a few\r\ntens of thousands of years from the dawn of civilisation--had lifted\r\nman to the level of the Eskimo, yet one must hesitate to admit\r\nthe comparison. Lord Avebury reproduces an Eskimo drawing, or\r\npicture-message, in his \"Prehistoric Times,\" to which it would be\r\ndifficult to find a parallel in Magdalenian remains. I do not mean\r\nthat the art is superior, but the complex life represented on the\r\npicture-message, and the intelligence with which it is represented, are\r\nbeyond anything that we know of Palaeolithic man. I may add that nearly\r\nall the drawings and statues of men and women which the Palaeolithic\r\nartist has left us are marked by the intense sexual exaggeration--the\r\n\"obscenity,\" in modern phraseology--which we are apt to find in coarse\r\nsavages.\r\n\r\nThree races are traced in this period. One, identified by skeletons\r\nfound at Mentone and by certain statuettes, was negroid in character.\r\nProbably there was an occasional immigration from Africa. Another race\r\n(Cro-Magnon) was very tall, and seems to represent an invasion from some\r\nother part of the earth toward the close of the Old Stone Age. The third\r\nrace, which is compared to the Eskimo, and had a stature of about five\r\nfeet, seem to be the real continuers of the Palaeolithic man of Europe.\r\nCuriously enough, we have less authentic remains of this race than\r\nof its predecessor, and can only say that, as we should expect, the\r\nape-like features--the low forehead, the heavy frontal ridges, the\r\nbulging teeth, etc.--are moderating. The needles we have found--round,\r\npolished, and pierced splinters of bone, sometimes nearly as fine as a\r\nbodkin--show indisputably that man then had clothing, but it is curious\r\nthat the artist nearly always draws him nude. There is also generally a\r\nseries of marks round the contour of the body to indicate that he had a\r\nconspicuous coat of hair. Unfortunately, the faces of the men are merely\r\na few unsatisfactory gashes in the bone or horn, and do not picture\r\nthis interesting race to us. The various statuettes of women generally\r\nsuggest a type akin to the wife of the Bushman.\r\n\r\nWe have, in fine, a race of hunters, with fine stone knives and\r\njavelins. Toward the close of the period we find a single representation\r\nof an arrow, which was probably just coming into use, but it is not\r\ngenerally known in the Old Stone Age. One of the drawings seems to\r\nrepresent a kind of bridle on a horse, but we need more evidence than\r\nthis to convince us that the horse was already tamed, nor is there any\r\nreason to suppose that the dog or reindeer had been tamed, or that the\r\nground was tilled even in the most rudimentary way. Artistic skill, the\r\nuse of clothing and fire, and a finer feeling in the shaping of weapons\r\nand implements, are the highest certain indications of the progress made\r\nby the end of the Old Stone Age.\r\n\r\nBut there was probably an advance made which we do not find recorded,\r\nor only equivocally recorded, in the memorials of the age. Speech was\r\nprobably the greatest invention of Magdalenian man. It has been pointed\r\nout that the spine in the lower jaw, to which the tongue-muscle is\r\nattached, is so poorly developed in Palaeolithic man that we may\r\ninfer from it the absence of articulate speech. The deduction has been\r\ncriticised, but a comparison of the Palaeolithic jaw with that of the\r\nape on one hand and modern man on the other gives weight to it. Whatever\r\nmay have been earlier man's power of expression, the closer social life\r\nof the Magdalenian period would lead to a great development of it. Some\r\nwriters go so far as to suggest that certain obscure marks painted\r\non pebbles or drawn on the cavern-walls by men at the close of the\r\nPalaeolithic Age may represent a beginning of written language, or\r\nnumbers, or conventional signs. The interpretation of these is obscure\r\nand doubtful. It is not until ages afterwards that we find the first\r\nclear traces of written language, and then they take the form of\r\npictographs (like the Egyptian hieroglyphics or the earliest Chinese\r\ncharacters).\r\n\r\nWe cannot doubt, however, that articulate speech would be rapidly\r\nevolved in the social life of the later Magdalenian period, and the\r\nimportance of this acquisition can hardly be exaggerated. Imagine even a\r\nmodern community without the device of articulate language. A very large\r\nproportion of the community, who are now maintained at a certain level\r\nby the thought of others, communicated to them by speech, would sink\r\nbelow the civilised standard, and the transmission and improvement of\r\nideas would be paralysed. It would not be paradoxical to regard the\r\nsocial life and developing speech of Magdalenian man as the chief cause\r\nof the rapid advance toward civilisation which will follow in the next\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nAnd it is not without interest to notice that a fall in the temperature\r\nof the earth is the immediate cause of this social life. The building\r\nof homes of any kind seems to be unknown to Magdalenian man. The artist\r\nwould have left us some sketchy representation of it if there had been\r\nanything in the nature of a tent in his surroundings. The rock-shelter\r\nand the cave are the homes which men seek from the advancing cold. As\r\nthese are relatively few in number, fixed in locality, and often of\r\nlarge dimensions, the individualism of the earlier times is replaced by\r\ncollective life. Sociologists still dispute whether the clan arose\r\nby the cohesion of families or the family arose within the clan. Such\r\nevidence as is afforded by prehistoric remains is entirely in favour\r\nof the opinion of Professor Westermarck, that the family preceded the\r\nlarger group. Families of common descent would now cling together and\r\noccupy a common cavern, and, when the men gathered at night with the\r\nwomen for the roasting and eating of the horse or deer they had hunted,\r\nand the work of the artist and the woman was considered, the uncouth\r\nmuttering and gesticulating was slowly forged into the great instrument\r\nof articulate speech. The first condition of more rapid progress was\r\ninstinctively gained.\r\n\r\nOur story of life has so often turned on this periodical lowering of the\r\nclimate of the earth that it is interesting to find this last and most\r\nimportant advance so closely associated with it that we are forced\r\nonce more to regard it as the effective cause. The same may be said of\r\nanother fundamental advance of the men of the later Palaeolithic age,\r\nthe discovery of the art of making fire. It coincides with the oncoming\r\nof the cold, either in the Mousterian or the Magdalenian. It was more\r\nprobably a chance discovery than an invention. Savages so commonly make\r\nfire by friction--rubbing sticks, drills, etc.--that one is naturally\r\ntempted to regard this as the primitive method. I doubt if this was the\r\ncase. When, in Neolithic times, men commonly bury the dead, and put some\r\nof their personal property in the grave with them, the fire-kindling\r\napparatus we find is a flint and a piece of iron pyrites. Palaeolithic\r\nman made his implements of any kind of hard and heavy stone, and it\r\nis probable that he occasionally selected iron ore for the purpose.\r\nAn attempt to chip it with flint would cause sparks that might fall on\r\ninflammable material, and set it alight. Little intelligence would be\r\nneeded to turn this discovery to account.\r\n\r\nApart from these conjectures as to particular features in the life\r\nof prehistoric man, it will be seen that we have now a broad and firm\r\nconception of its evolution. From the ape-level man very slowly mounts\r\nto the stage of human savagery. During long ages he seems to have made\r\nalmost no progress. There is nothing intrinsically progressive in his\r\nnature. Let a group of men be isolated at any stage of human evolution,\r\nand placed in an unchanging environment, and they will remain stationary\r\nfor an indefinite period. When Europeans began to traverse the globe in\r\nthe last few centuries, they picked up here and there little groups of\r\nmen who had, in their isolation, remained just where their fathers had\r\nbeen when they quitted the main road of advance in the earlier stages\r\nof the Old Stone Age. The evolution of man is guided by the same laws\r\nas the evolution of any other species. Thus we can understand the long\r\nperiod of stagnation, or of incalculably slow advance. Thus, too, we can\r\nunderstand why, at length, the pace of man toward his unconscious goal\r\nis quickened. He is an inhabitant of the northern hemisphere, and\r\nthe northern hemisphere is shaken by the last of the great geological\r\nrevolutions. From its first stress emerges the primeval savage of the\r\nearly part of the Old Stone Age, still bearing the deep imprint of his\r\norigin, surpassing his fellow-animals only in the use of crude stone\r\nimplements. Then the stress of conditions relaxes--the great ice-sheet\r\ndisappears--and again during a vast period he makes very little\r\nprogress. The stress returns. The genial country is stripped and\r\nimpoverished, and the reindeer and mammoth spread to the south of\r\nEurope. But once more the adversity has its use, and man, stimulated\r\nin his hunt for food, invigorated by the cold, driven into social life,\r\nadvances to the culmination of the Old Stone Age.\r\n\r\nWe are still very far from civilisation, but the few tens of thousands\r\nof years that separate Magdalenian man from it will be traversed with\r\nrelative speed--though, we should always remember, with a speed far\r\nless than the pace at which man is advancing to-day. A new principle now\r\nenters into play: a specifically human law of evolution is formulated.\r\nIt has no element of mysticism, and is merely an expression of the fact\r\nthat the previous general agencies of development have created in man\r\nan intelligence of a higher grade than that of any other animal. In his\r\nlarger and more plastic brain the impressions received from the outer\r\nworld are blended in ideas, and in his articulate speech he has a unique\r\nmeans of entering the idea-world of his fellows. The new principle\r\nof evolution, which arises from this superiority, is that man's chief\r\nstimulus to advance will now come from his cultural rather than his\r\nphysical environment. Physical surroundings will continue to affect\r\nhim. One race will outstrip another because of its advantage in soil,\r\nclimate, or geographical position. But the chief key to the remaining\r\nand more important progress of mankind, which we are about to review, is\r\nthe stimulating contact of the differing cultures of different races.\r\n\r\nThis will be seen best in the history of civilisation, but the principle\r\nmay be recognised in the New Stone Age which leads from primeval\r\nsavagery to civilisation, or, to be more accurate and just, to the\r\nbeginning of the historical period. It used to be thought that there was\r\na mysterious blank or gulf between the Old and the New Stone Age.\r\nThe Palaeolithic culture seemed to come to an abrupt close, and the\r\nNeolithic culture was sharply distinguished from it. It was suspected\r\nthat some great catastrophe had destroyed the Palaeolithic race in\r\nEurope, and a new race entered as the adverse conditions were removed.\r\nThis was especially held to be the case in England. The old Palaeolithic\r\nrace had never reached Ireland, which seems to have been cut oft from\r\nthe Continent during the Ice-Age, and most of the authorities still\r\nbelieve--in spite of some recent claims--that it never reached Scotland.\r\nEngland itself was well populated, and the remains found in the caves\r\nof Derbyshire show that even the artist--or his art--had reached that\r\ndistrict. This Palaeolithic race seemed to come to a mysterious end,\r\nand Europe was then invaded by the higher Neolithic race. England was\r\nprobably detached from the Continent about the end of the Magdalenian\r\nperiod. It was thought that some great devastation--the last ice-sheet,\r\na submersion of the land, or a plague--then set in, and men were unable\r\nto retreat south.\r\n\r\nIt is now claimed by many authorities that there are traces of a\r\nMiddle Stone (Mesolithic) period even in England, and nearly all the\r\nauthorities admit that such a transitional stage can be identified\r\nin the Pyrenean region. This region had been the great centre of the\r\nMagdalenian culture. Its large frescoed caverns exhibit the culmination\r\nof the Old Stone life, and afford many connecting links with the new.\r\nIt is, however, a clearly established and outstanding fact that the\r\ncharacteristic art of Magdalenian man comes to an abrupt and complete\r\nclose, and it does not seem possible to explain this without supposing\r\nthat the old race was destroyed or displaced. If we could accept\r\nthe view that it was the Eskimo-like race of the Palaeolithic that\r\ncultivated this art, and that they retreated north with the reindeer\r\nand the ice, and survive in our Eskimo, we should have a plausible\r\nexplanation. In point of fact, we find no trace whatever of this slow\r\nmigration from the south of Europe to the north. The more probable\r\nsupposition is that a new race, with more finished stone implements,\r\nentered Europe, imposed its culture upon the older race, and gradually\r\nexterminated or replaced it. We may leave it open whether a part of the\r\nold race retreated to the north, and became the Eskimo.\r\n\r\nWhence came the new race and its culture? It will be seen on reflection\r\nthat we have so far been studying the evolution of man in Europe only,\r\nbecause there alone are his remains known with any fullness. But the\r\nimportant region which stretches from Morocco to Persia must have been\r\nan equally, if not more, important theatre of development. While Europe\r\nwas shivering in the last stage of the Ice-Age, and the mammoth and\r\nreindeer browsed in the snows down to the south of France, this\r\nregion would enjoy an excellent climate and a productive soil. We may\r\nconfidently assume that there was a large and stirring population of\r\nhuman beings on it during the Magdalenian cold. We may, with many of the\r\nauthorities, look to this temperate and fertile region for the slight\r\nadvance made by early Neolithic man beyond his predecessor. As the cold\r\nrelaxed, and the southern fringe of dreary steppe w as converted once\r\nmore into genial country, the race would push north. There is evidence\r\nthat there were still land bridges across the Mediterranean. From Spain\r\nand the south of France this early Neolithic race rapidly spread over\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the New Stone Age at first goes much beyond\r\nthe Old in culture. Works on prehistoric man are apt to give as features\r\nof \"Neolithic man\" all that we know him to have done or discovered\r\nduring the whole of the New Stone Age. We read that he not only gave a\r\nfiner finish to, and sometimes polished, his stone weapons, but built\r\nhouses, put imposing monuments over his dead, and had agriculture, tame\r\ncattle, pottery, and weaving. This is misleading, as the more advanced\r\nof these accomplishments appear only late in the New Stone Age. The\r\nonly difference we find at first is that the stone axes, etc., are more\r\nfinely chipped or flaked, and are frequently polished by rubbing on\r\nstone moulds. There is no sudden leap in culture or intelligence in the\r\nstory of man.\r\n\r\nIt would be supremely interesting to trace the evolution of human\r\nindustries and ideas during the few tens of thousands of years of the\r\nNew Stone Age. During that time moral and religious ideas are largely\r\ndeveloped, political or social forms are elaborated, and the arts of\r\ncivilised man have their first rude inauguration. The foundations of\r\ncivilisation are laid. Unfortunately, precisely because the period is\r\nrelatively so short and the advance so rapid, its remains are crushed\r\nand mingled in a thin seam of the geological chronicle, and we cannot\r\nrestore the gradual course of its development with any confidence.\r\nEstimates of its duration vary from 20,000 to 70,000 years; though\r\nSir W. Turner has recently concluded, from an examination of marks\r\non Scottish monuments, that Neolithic man probably came on foot from\r\nScandinavia to Scotland, and most geologists would admit that it must be\r\nat least a hundred thousand years since one could cross from Norway\r\nto Scotland on foot. As usual, we must leave open the question of\r\nchronology, and be content with a modest provisional estimate of 40,000\r\nor 50,000 years.\r\n\r\nWe dimly perceive the gradual advance of human culture in this important\r\nperiod. During the Old Stone Age man had made more progress than he had\r\nmade in the preceding million years; during the New Stone Age--at least\r\none-fourth as long as the Old--he made even greater progress; and, we\r\nmay add, in the historical period, which is one-fourth the length of the\r\nNeolithic Age, he will make greater progress still. The pace of advance\r\nnaturally increases as intelligence grows, but that is not the whole\r\nexplanation. The spread of the race, the gathering of its members into\r\ntribes, and the increasing enterprise of men in hunting and migration,\r\nlead to incessant contacts of different cultures and a progressive\r\nstimulation.\r\n\r\nAt first Neolithic man is content with finer weapons. His stone axe is\r\nso finely shaped and polished that it sometimes looks like forged or\r\nmoulded metal. He also drills a clean hole through it--possibly by means\r\nof a stick working in wet sand--and gives it a long wooden handle. He\r\ndigs in the earth for finer flints, and in some of his ancient shafts\r\n(Grimes, Graves and Cissbury) we find picks of reindeer horn\r\nand hollowed blocks of chalk in which he probably burned fat for\r\nillumination underground. But in the later part of the Neolithic--to\r\nwhich much of this finer work also may belong--we find him building\r\nhuts, rearing large stone monuments, having tame dogs and pigs and oxen,\r\ngrowing corn and barley, and weaving primitive fabrics. He lives in\r\nlarge and strong villages, round which we must imagine his primitive\r\ncornfields growing and his cattle grazing, and in which there must have\r\nbeen some political organisation under chiefs.\r\n\r\nWhen we wish to trace the beginning of these inventions we have the same\r\ndifficulty that we experienced in tracing the first stages of new animal\r\ntypes. The beginning takes place in some restricted region, and our\r\ncasual scratching of the crust of the earth or the soil may not touch\r\nit for ages, if it has survived at all. But for our literature and\r\nillustrations a future generation would be equally puzzled to know how\r\nwe got the idea of the aeroplane or the electric light. In some cases we\r\ncan make a good guess at the origin of Neolithic man's institutions. Let\r\nus take pottery. Palaeolithic man cooked his joint of horse or reindeer,\r\nand, no doubt, scorched it. Suppose that some Palaeolithic Soyer had\r\nconceived the idea of protecting the joint, and preserving its juices,\r\nby daubing it with a coat of clay. He would accidentally make a clay\r\nvessel. This is Mr. Clodd's ingenious theory of the origin of pottery.\r\nThe development of agriculture is not very puzzling. The seed of corn\r\nwould easily be discovered to have a food-value, and the discovery of\r\nthe growth of the plant from the seed would not require a very high\r\nintelligence. Some ants, we may recall, have their fungus-beds. It would\r\nbe added by many that the ant gives us another parallel in its keeping\r\nof droves of aphides, which it \"milks.\" But it is now doubted if the ant\r\ndeliberately cultivates the aphides with this aim. Early weaving might\r\narise from the plaiting of grasses. If wild flax were used, it might be\r\nnoticed that part of it remained strong when the rest decayed, and so\r\nthe threads might be selected and woven.\r\n\r\nThe building of houses, after living for ages in stone caverns, would\r\nnot be a very profound invention. The early houses were--as may be\r\ngathered from the many remains in Devonshire and Cornwall--mere rings of\r\nheaped stones, over which, most probably, was put a roof of branches or\r\nreeds, plastered with mud. They belong to the last part of the New Stone\r\nAge. In other places, chiefly Switzerland, Neolithic man lived in wooden\r\nhuts built on piles in the shallow shores of lakes. It is an evidence\r\nthat life on land is becoming as stimulating as we find it in the age of\r\nDeinosaurs or early mammals. These pile-villages of Switzerland lasted\r\nuntil the historical period, and the numerous remains in the mud of the\r\nlake show the gradual passage into the age of metal.\r\n\r\nBefore the metal age opened, however, there seem to have been fresh\r\ninvasions of Europe and changes of its culture. The movements of the\r\nvarious early races of men are very obscure, and it would be useless\r\nto give here even an outline of the controversy. Anthropologists have\r\ngenerally taken the relative length and width of the skull as a standard\r\nfeature of a race, and distinguished long-headed (dolichocephalic),\r\nshort-headed (brachycephalic), and middle-headed (mesaticephalic) races.\r\nEven on this test the most divergent conclusions were reached in regard\r\nto early races, and now the test itself is seriously disputed. Some\r\nauthorities believe that there is no unchanging type of skull in a\r\nparticular race, but that, for instance, a long-headed race may become\r\nshort-headed by going to live in an elevated region.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, in a few words, that it is generally believed that two\r\nraces invaded Europe and displaced the first Neolithic race. The race\r\nwhich chiefly settled in the Swiss region is generally believed to have\r\ncome from Asia, and advanced across Europe by way of the valley of the\r\nDanube. The native home of the wheat and barley and millet, which, as\r\nwe know, the lake-dwellers cultivated, is said to be Asia. On the other\r\nhand, the Neolithic men who have left stone monuments on our soil are\r\nsaid to be a different race, coming, by way of North Africa, from Asia,\r\nand advancing along the west of Europe to Scandinavia. A map of the\r\nearth, on which the distribution of these stone monuments--all probably\r\nconnected with the burial of the dead--is indicated, suggests such a\r\nline of advance from India, with a slighter branch eastward. But the\r\nwhole question of these invasions is disputed, and there are many who\r\nregard the various branches of the population of Europe as sections of\r\none race which spread upward from the shores of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nIt is clear at least that there were great movements of population, much\r\nmingling of types and commercial interchange of products, so that we\r\nhave the constant conditions of advance. A last invasion seems to have\r\ntaken place some two or three thousand years before the Christian era,\r\nwhen the Aryans overspread Europe. After all the controversy about the\r\nAryans it seems clear that a powerful race, representing the ancestors\r\nof most of the actual peoples of Europe and speaking the dialects which\r\nhave been modified into the related languages of the Greeks, Romans,\r\nGermans, Celts, Lithuanians, etc., imposed its speech on nearly the\r\nwhole of the continent. Only in the Basques and Picts do we seem to find\r\nsome remnants of the earlier non-Aryan tongues. But whether these Aryans\r\nreally came from Asia, as it used to be thought, or developed in the\r\neast of Europe, is uncertain. We seem justified in thinking that a very\r\nrobust race had been growing in numbers and power during the Neolithic\r\nAge, somewhere in the region of South-east Europe and Southwest Asia,\r\nand that a few thousand years before the Christian Era one branch of\r\nit descended upon India, another upon the Persian region, and another\r\noverspread Europe. We will return to the point later. Instead of being\r\nthe bearers of a higher civilisation, these primitive Aryans seem to\r\nhave been lower in culture than the peoples on whom they fell.\r\n\r\nThe Neolithic Age had meantime passed into the Age of Metal. Copper was\r\nprobably the first metal to be used. It is easily worked, and is found\r\nin nature. But the few copper implements we possess do not suggest a\r\n\"Copper Age\" of any length or extent. It was soon found, apparently,\r\nthat an admixture of tin hardened the copper, and the Bronze Age\r\nfollowed. The use of bronze was known in Egypt about 4800 B.C. (Flinders\r\nPetrie), but little used until about 2000 B.C. By that time (or a few\r\ncenturies later) it had spread as far as Scandinavia and Britain. The\r\nregion of invention is not known, but we have large numbers of beautiful\r\nspecimens of bronze work--including brooches and hair-pins--in all parts\r\nof Europe. Finally, about the thirteenth century B.C., we find the first\r\ntraces of the use of iron. The first great centre for the making of iron\r\nweapons seems to have been Hallstatt, in the Austrian Alps, whence it\r\nspread slowly over Europe, reaching Scandinavia and Britain between\r\n500 and 300 B.C. But the story of man had long before this entered the\r\nhistorical period, to which we now turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. EVOLUTION IN HISTORY\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapters I have endeavoured to show how, without\r\ninvoking any \"definitely directed variations,\" which we seem to have\r\nlittle chance of understanding, we may obtain a broad conception of the\r\nway in which the earth and its living inhabitants came to be what they\r\nare. No one is more conscious than the writer that this account is\r\nextremely imperfect. The limits of the volume have permitted me to use\r\nonly a part of the material which modern science affords, but if the\r\nwhole of our discoveries were described the sketch would still remain\r\nvery imperfect. The evolutionary conception of the world is itself\r\nundergoing evolution in the mind of man. Age by age the bits of fresh\r\ndiscovery are fitted into the great mosaic. Large areas are still\r\nleft for the scientific artist of the future to fill. Yet even in\r\nits imperfect state the evolutionary picture of the world is most\r\nilluminating. The questions that have been on the lips of thoughtful men\r\nsince they first looked out with adult eyes on the panorama of nature\r\nare partly answered. Whence and Why are no longer sheer riddles of the\r\nsphinx.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be seen if evolutionary principles will throw at least an\r\nequal light on the progress of humanity in the historical period.\r\nHere again the questions, Whence and Why, have been asked in vain for\r\ncountless ages. If man is a progressive animal, why has the progress\r\nbeen confined to some of the race? If humanity shared at first a common\r\npatrimony, why have the savages remained savages, and the barbarians\r\nbarbaric? Why has progress been incarnated so exceptionally in the white\r\nsection of the race, the Europeans? We approach these questions more\r\nconfidently after surveying the story of terrestrial life in the light\r\nof evolutionary principles. Since the days of the primeval microbe it\r\nhas happened that a few were chosen and many were left behind. There was\r\nno progressive element in the advancing few that was not shared by the\r\nstagnant many. The difference lay in the environment. Let us see if this\r\nprinciple applies to the history of civilisation.\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter I observed that, with the rise of human\r\nintelligence, the cultural environment becomes more important than the\r\nphysical. Since human progress is a progress in ideas and the emotions\r\nwhich accompany them, this may seem to be a truism. In point of fact it\r\nis assailed by more than one recent historical writer. The scepticism\r\nis partly due to a misunderstanding. No one but a fanatical adherent of\r\nextreme theories of heredity will deny that the physical surroundings of\r\na race continue to be of great importance. The progress of a particular\r\npeople may often be traced in part to its physical environment;\r\nespecially to changes of environment, by migration, for instance.\r\nFurther, it is not for a moment suggested that a race never evolves its\r\nown culture, but has always to receive it from another. If we said that,\r\nwe should be ultimately driven to recognise culture, like the early\r\nChinese, as a gift of the gods. What is meant is that the chief key to\r\nthe progress of certain peoples, the arrest of progress in others,\r\nand the entire absence of progress in others, is the study of their\r\nrelations with, or isolation from, other peoples. They make progress\r\nchiefly according to the amount of stimulation they get by contact with\r\na diverse culture.\r\n\r\nLet us see if this furnishes a broad explanation of the position of the\r\nvarious peoples of the world. The Ethnologist tells us that the\r\nlowest peoples of the earth are the Yahgans of Tierra del Fuego, the\r\nHottentots, a number of little-understood peoples in Central Africa,\r\nthe wild Veddahs of Ceylon, the (extinct) Tasmanians, the Aetas in the\r\ninterior of the Philippines, and certain fragments of peoples on islands\r\nof the Indian Ocean. There is not the least trace of a common element\r\nin the environment of these peoples to explain why they have remained\r\nat the level of primitive humanity. Many of them lived in the most\r\npromising and resourceful surroundings. What is common to them all is\r\ntheir isolation from the paths of later humanity. They represent the\r\nfirst wave of human distribution, pressed to the tips of continents or\r\non islands by later waves, and isolated. The position of the Veddahs\r\nis, to some extent, an exception; and it is interesting to find that the\r\nlatest German students of that curious people think that they have been\r\nclassed too low by earlier investigators.\r\n\r\nWe cannot run over all the peoples of the earth in this way, but will\r\nbriefly glance at the lower races of the various continents. A branch\r\nof the second phase of developing humanity, the negroid stock, spread\r\neastward over the Asiatic islands and Australia, and westward into\r\nAfrica. The extreme wing of this army, the Australian blacks, too\r\nclearly illustrates the principle to need further reference. It has\r\nretained for ages the culture of the middle Palaeolithic. The negritos\r\nwho penetrated to the Philippines are another extreme instance of\r\nisolation. The Melanesians of the islands of the Indian and Pacific\r\nOcean are less low, because those islands have been slowly crossed by\r\na much higher race, the Polynesians. The Maoris of New Zealand, the\r\nTongans, Hawaians, etc., are people of our own (Caucasic) stock,\r\nprobably diverging to the south-east while our branch of the stock\r\npressed westward. This not only explains the higher condition of the\r\nMaoris, etc., but also shows why they have not advanced like their\r\nEuropean cousins. Their environment is one of the finest in the world,\r\nbut--it lies far away from the highways of culture.\r\n\r\nIn much the same way can we interpret the swarming peoples of Africa.\r\nThe more primitive peoples which arrived first, and were driven south or\r\ninto the central forests by the later and better equipped invaders from\r\nthe central zone, have remained the more primitive. The more northern\r\npeoples, on the fringe of, or liable to invasion from, the central\r\nzone, have made more advance, and have occasionally set up rudimentary\r\ncivilisations. But the movements from the north to the south in early\r\nhistorical times are too obscure to enable us to trace the action of\r\nthe principle more clearly. The peoples of the Mediterranean fringe\r\nof Africa, living in the central zone of stimulation, have proved very\r\nprogressive. Under the Romans North Africa was at least as civilised as\r\nBritain, and an equally wise and humane European policy might lead to\r\ntheir revival to-day.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to Asia we encounter a mass of little-understood peoples\r\nand a few civilisations with obscure histories, but we have a fairly\r\nclear application of the principle. The northern, more isolated\r\npeoples, are the more primitive; the north-eastern, whose isolation\r\nis accentuated by a severe environment, are most primitive of all. The\r\nEskimo, whether they are the survivors of the Magdalenian race or a\r\nregiment thrown off the Asiatic army as it entered America, remain at\r\nthe primitive level. The American peoples in turn accord with this view.\r\nThose which penetrate furthest south remain stagnant or deteriorate;\r\nthose which remain in the far north remain below the level of\r\ncivilisation, because the land-bridge to Asia breaks down; but those\r\nwhich settle in Central America evolve a civilisation. A large zone,\r\nfrom Mexico to Peru, was overspread by this civilisation, and it was\r\nadvancing steadily when European invaders destroyed it, and reduced the\r\ncivilised Peruvians to the Quichas of to-day.\r\n\r\nThere remain the civilisations of Asia, and here we have a new and\r\ninteresting aspect of the question. How did these civilisations develop\r\nin Asia, and how is it that they have remained stagnant for ages, while\r\nEurope advanced? The origin of the Asiatic civilisations is obscure.\r\nThe common idea of their vast antiquity has no serious ground. The\r\ncivilisation of Japan cannot be traced back beyond about the eighth\r\ncentury B.C. Even then the population was probably a mixed flotsam from\r\nneighbouring lands--Ainus, Koreans, Chinese, and Malays. What was the\r\ncharacter of the primitive civilisation resulting from the mixture\r\nof these different cultures we do not know. But the chief elements\r\nof Japanese civilisation came later from China. Japan had no written\r\nlanguage of any kind until it received one from China about the sixth\r\ncentury of the Christian Era.\r\n\r\nThe civilisation of China itself goes back at least to about 2300\r\nB.C., but we cannot carry it further back with any confidence. The\r\nauthorities, endeavouring to pick their steps carefully among old\r\nChinese legends, are now generally agreed that the primitive Chinese\r\nwere a nomadic tribe which slowly wandered across Asia from about the\r\nshores of the Caspian Sea. In other words, they started from a region\r\nclose to the cradle of western civilisation. Some students, in\r\nfact, make them akin to the Akkadians, who founded civilisation in\r\nMesopotamia. At all events, they seem to have conveyed a higher culture\r\nto the isolated inhabitants of Western Asia, and a long era of progress\r\nfollowed their settlement in a new environment. For more than two\r\nthousand years, however, they have been enclosed in their walls and\r\nmountains and seas, while the nations of the remote west clashed\r\nunceasingly against each other. We need no other explanation of their\r\nstagnation. To speak of the \"unprogressiveness\" of the Chinese is pure\r\nmysticism. The next generation will see.\r\n\r\nThe civilisation of India is also far later than the civilisation of the\r\nwest, and seems to be more clearly due to borrowing from the west. The\r\nprimitive peoples who live on the hills about India, or in the jungles,\r\nare fragments, apparently, of the Stone Age inhabitants of India, or\r\ntheir descendants. Their culture may have degenerated under the adverse\r\nconditions of dislodgement from their home, but we may fairly conclude\r\nthat it was never high. On these primitive inhabitants of the plains\r\nof India there fell, somewhere about or before 1000 B.C., the Asiatic\r\nbranch of the Aryan race.\r\n\r\nA very recent discovery (1908) has strongly confirmed and illumined this\r\nview of the origin of Indian civilisation. Explorers in the ruins of the\r\nancient capital of the Hittite Empire (in North Syria and Cappadocia)\r\nfound certain treaties which had been concluded, about 1300 B.C.,\r\nbetween the Hittites and the king of the Aryans. The names of the\r\ndeities which are mentioned in the treaties seem to show that the\r\nPersian and Indian branches of the Aryan race were not yet separated,\r\nbut formed a united kingdom on the banks of the Euphrates. They seem to\r\nhave come from Bactria (and possibly beyond), and introduced the horse\r\n(hitherto unknown to the Babylonians) about 1800 B.C. It is surmised by\r\nthe experts that the Indian and Persian branches separated soon\r\nafter 1300 B.C., possibly on account of religious quarrels, and the\r\nSanscrit-speaking branch, with its Vedic hymns and its Hinduism,\r\nwandered eastward and northward until it discovered and took possession\r\nof the Indian peninsula. The long isolation of India, since the\r\ncessation of its commerce with Rome until modern times, explains the\r\nlater stagnation of its civilisation.\r\n\r\nThus the supposed \"non-progressiveness\" of the east, after once\r\nestablishing civilisation, turns out to be a question of geography and\r\nhistory. We have now to see if the same intelligible principles will\r\nthrow light on the \"progressiveness\" of the western branch of the Aryan\r\nrace, and on the course of western civilisation generally. [*]\r\n\r\n     * In speaking of Europeans as Aryans I am, of course,\r\n     allowing for an absorption of the conquered non-Aryans. A\r\n     European nation is no more Aryan, in strict truth, than the\r\n     English are Anglo-Saxon.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first two centres of civilisation are found in the valley of the\r\nNile and the valley of the Tigris and Euphrates; the civilisations of\r\nEgypt and Babylon, the oldest in the world. There is, however, a good\r\ndeal of evidence by which we may bring these civilisations nearer to\r\neach other in their earliest stages, so that we must not confidently\r\nspeak of two quite independent civilisations. The civilisation which\r\ndeveloped on the Euphrates is found first at Susa, on the hills\r\noverlooking the plains of Mesopotamia, about 6000 B.C. A people akin\r\nto the Turkish or Chinese lives among the hills, and makes the vague\r\nadvance from higher Neolithic culture to primitive civilisation. About\r\nthe same time the historical or dynastic civilisation begins in Egypt,\r\nand some high authorities, such as Mr. Flinders Petrie, believe that the\r\nevidence suggests that the founders of this dynastic civilisation came\r\nfrom \"the mountainous region between Egypt and the Red Sea.\" From the\r\nnorthern part of the same region, we saw, the ancestors of the Chinese\r\nset out across Asia.\r\n\r\nWe have here a very suggestive set of facts in connection with early\r\ncivilisation. The Syro-Arabian region seems to have been a thickly\r\npopulated centre of advancing tribes, which would be in striking accord\r\nwith the view of progress that I am following. But we need not press the\r\ndisputed and obscure theory of the origin of the historic Egyptians. The\r\nremains are said to show that the lower valley of the Nile, which must\r\nhave been but recently formed by the river's annual deposit of mud, was\r\na theatre of contending tribes from about 8000 to 6000 B.C. The fertile\r\nlands that had thus been provided attracted tribes from east, west, and\r\nsouth, and there is a great confusion of primitive cultures on its soil.\r\n\r\nIt is not certain that the race which eventually conquered and founded\r\nthe historical dynasties came from the mountainous lands to the east. It\r\nis enough for us to know that the whole region fermented with jostling\r\npeoples. Why it did so the previous chapters will explain. It is\r\nthe temperate zone into which men had been pressed by the northern\r\nice-sheet, and from Egypt to the Indian Ocean it remained a fertile\r\nbreeding-ground of nations.\r\n\r\nThese early civilisations are merely the highest point of Neolithic\r\nculture. The Egyptian remains show a very gradual development of\r\npottery, ornamentation, etc., into which copper articles are introduced\r\nin time. The dawn of civilisation is as gradual as the dawn of the\r\nday. The whole gamut of culture--Eolithic, Palaeolithic, Neolithic, and\r\ncivilised--is struck in the successive layers of Egyptian remains.\r\nBut to give even a summary of its historical development is neither\r\nnecessary nor possible here. The maintenance of its progress is as\r\nintelligible as its initial advance. Unlike China, it lay in the main\r\nregion of human development, and we find that even before 6000 B.C. it\r\ndeveloped a system of shipping and commerce which kept it in touch with\r\nother peoples over the entire region, and helped to promote development\r\nboth in them and itself.\r\n\r\nEqually intelligible is the development of civilisation in Mesopotamia.\r\nThe long and fertile valley which lies between the mountainous region\r\nand the southern desert is, like the valley of the Nile, a quite recent\r\nformation. The rivers have gradually formed it with their deposit in the\r\ncourse of the last ten thousand years. As this rich soil became covered\r\nwith vegetation, it attracted the mountaineers from the north. As I\r\nsaid, the earliest centre of the civilisation which was to culminate in\r\nBabylon and Nineveh is traced at Susa, on the hills to the north, about\r\n6000 B.C. The Akkadians (highlanders) or Sumerians, the Turanian people\r\nwho established this civilisation, descended upon the rivers, and, about\r\n5000 B.C., set up the early cities of Mesopotamia. As in the case of\r\nEgypt, again, more tribes were attracted to the fertile region, and\r\nby about 4000 B.C. we find that Semitic tribes from the north have\r\nsuperseded the Sumerians, and taken over their civilisation.\r\n\r\nIn these ancient civilisations, developing in touch with each other, and\r\nsurrounded by great numbers of peoples at the high Neolithic level from\r\nwhich they had themselves started, culture advanced rapidly. Not\r\nonly science, art, literature, commerce, law, and social forms were\r\ndeveloped, but moral idealism reached a height that compares well\r\neven with that of modern times. The recovery in our time of the actual\r\nremains of Egypt and Babylon has corrected much of the libellous legend,\r\nwhich found its way into Greek and European literature, concerning\r\nthose ancient civilisations. But, as culture advances, human development\r\nbecomes so complex that we must refrain from attempting to pursue, even\r\nin summary, its many outgrowths. The evolution of morality, of art, of\r\nreligion, of polity, and of literature would each require a whole volume\r\nfor satisfactory treatment. All that we can do here is to show how the\r\nmodern world and its progressive culture are related to these ancient\r\nempires.\r\n\r\nThe aphorism that \"all light comes from the east\" may at times be\r\npressed too literally. To suggest that western peoples have done no more\r\nthan receive and develop the culture of the older east would be at once\r\nunscientific and unhistorical. By the close of the Neolithic age a great\r\nnumber of peoples had reached the threshold of civilisation, and it\r\nwould be extremely improbable that in only two parts of the world the\r\nconditions would be found of further progress. That the culture of\r\nthese older empires has enriched Europe and had a great share in its\r\ncivilisation, is one of the most obvious of historical truths. But we\r\nmust not seek to confine the action of later peoples to a mere borrowing\r\nof arts or institutions.\r\n\r\nYet some recent historical writers, in their eagerness to set up\r\nindigenous civilisations apart from those of Egypt and Mesopotamia, pass\r\nto the opposite extreme. We are prepared to find civilisation developing\r\nwherever the situation of a people exposes it to sufficient stimulation,\r\nand we do find advance made among many peoples apart from contact with\r\nthe great southern empires. It is uncertain whether the use of bronze\r\nis due first to the southern nations or to some European people, but the\r\ninvention of iron weapons is most probably due to European initiative.\r\nAgain, it is now not believed that the alphabets of Europe are derived\r\nfrom the hieroglyphics of Egypt, though it is an open question whether\r\nthey were not derived, through Phoenicia, from certain signs which we\r\nfind on ancient Egyptian pottery.\r\n\r\nIf we take first a broad view of the later course of civilisation we see\r\nat a glance the general relation of east and west. Some difficulty would\r\narise, if we pressed, as to the exact stage in which a nation may be\r\nsaid to become \"civilised,\" but we may follow the general usage of\r\narchaeologists and historians. They tell us, then, that civilisation\r\nfirst appears in Egypt about 8000 B.C. (settled civilisation about\r\n6000 B.C.), and in the Mesopotamian region about 6000 B.C. We next find\r\nNeolithic culture passing into what may be called civilisation in Crete\r\nand the neighbouring islands some time between 4000 and 3000 B.C., or\r\ntwo thousand years after the development of Egyptian commerce in that\r\nregion. We cannot say whether this civilisation in the AEgean sea\r\npreceded others which we afterwards find on the Asiatic mainland.\r\nThe beginning of the Hittite Empire in Asia Minor, and of Phoenician\r\nculture, is as yet unknown. But we can say that there was as yet no\r\ncivilisation in Europe. It is not until after 1600 that civilisation\r\nis established in Greece (Mycenae and Tiryns) as an offshoot of AEgean\r\nculture. Later still it appears among the Etruscans of Italy--to which,\r\nas we know, both Egyptian and AEgean vessels sailed. In other words, the\r\ncourse of civilisation is very plainly from east to west.\r\n\r\nBut we must be careful not to imagine that this represents a mere\r\ntransplantation of southern culture on a rude northern stock. The whole\r\nregion to the east of the Mediterranean was just as fitted to develop a\r\ncivilisation as the valley of the Nile. It swarmed with peoples having\r\nthe latest Neolithic culture, and, as they advanced, and developed\r\nnavigation, the territory of many of them became the high road of more\r\nadvanced peoples. A glance at the map will show that the easiest line of\r\nexpansion for a growing people was westward. The ocean lay to the right\r\nof the Babylonians, and the country north and south was not inviting.\r\nThe calmer Mediterranean with its fertile shores was the appointed field\r\nof expansion. The land route from Egypt lay, not to the dreary west in\r\nAfrica, but along the eastern shore of the Mediterranean, through Syria\r\nand Asia Minor. The land route from Babylon lay across northern\r\nSyria and Asia Minor. The sea route had Crete for its first and most\r\nconspicuous station. Hence the gradual appearance of civilisation in\r\nPhoenicia, Cappadocia, Lydia, and the Greek islands is a normal and\r\nnatural outcome of the geographical conditions.\r\n\r\nBut we must dismiss the later Asiatic civilisations, whose remains are\r\nfast coming to light, very briefly. Phoenicia probably had less part\r\nin the general advance than was formerly supposed. Now that we have\r\ndiscovered a powerful civilisation in the Greek islands themselves, we\r\nsee that it would keep Tyre and Sidon in check until it fell into decay\r\nabout 1000 B.C. After that date, for a few centuries, Phoenicia had a\r\ngreat influence on the development of Europe. The Hittites, on the other\r\nhand, are as yet imperfectly known. Their main region was Cappadocia,\r\nwhere, at least as far back as 1500 B.C., they developed so\r\ncharacteristic a civilisation, that its documents or inscriptions are\r\nalmost undecipherable. They at one time overran the whole of Asia Minor.\r\nOther peoples such as the Elamites, represent similar offshoots of the\r\nfermenting culture of the region. The Hebrews were probably a small and\r\nunimportant group, settled close round Jerusalem, until a few centuries\r\nbefore the Christian Era. They then assimilated the culture of the\r\nmore powerful nations which crossed and recrossed their territory. The\r\nPersians were, as we saw, a branch of the Aryan family which slowly\r\nadvanced between 1500 and 700 B.C., and then inherited the empire of\r\ndying Babylon.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting, and one of the most recently discovered, of these\r\nolder civilisations, was the AEgean. Its chief centre was Crete, but it\r\nspread over many of the neighbouring islands. Its art and its script are\r\nso distinctive that we must recognise it as a native development, not\r\na transplantation of Egyptian culture. Its ruins show it gradually\r\nemerging from the Neolithic stage about 4000 B.C., when Egyptian\r\ncommerce was well developed in its seas. Somewhere about 2500 B.C.\r\nthe whole of the islands seem to have been brought under the Cretan\r\nmonarchy, and the concentration of wealth and power led to a remarkable\r\nartistic development, on native lines. We find in Crete the remains of\r\nsplendid palaces, with advanced sanitary systems and a great luxuriance\r\nof ornamentation. It was this civilisation which founded the centre\r\nat Mycenae, on the Greek mainland, about the middle of the second\r\nmillennium B.C.\r\n\r\nBut our inquiry into the origin of European civilisation does not\r\ndemand any extensive description of the AEgean culture and its Mycenaean\r\noffshoot. It was utterly destroyed between 1500 and 1000 B.C., and\r\nthis was probably done by the Aryan ancestors of the later Greeks or\r\nHellenes. About the time when one branch of the Aryans was descending\r\nupon India and another preparing to rival decaying Babylonia, the third\r\nbranch overran Europe. It seems to have been a branch of these that\r\nswept down the Greek peninsula, and crossed the sea to sack and destroy\r\nthe centres of AEgean culture. Another branch poured down the Italian\r\npeninsula; another settled in the region of the Baltic, and would prove\r\nthe source of the Germanic nations; another, the Celtic, advanced to the\r\nwest of Europe. The mingling of this semi-barbaric population with\r\nthe earlier inhabitants provided the material of the nations of modern\r\nEurope. Our last page in the story of the earth must be a short account\r\nof its civilisation.\r\n\r\nThe first branch to become civilised, and to carry culture to a greater\r\nheight than the older nations had ever done, was the Hellenes. There is\r\nno need for us to speculate on the \"genius\" of the Hellenes, or even\r\nto enlarge on the natural advantages of the lower part of the peninsula\r\nwhich they occupied. A glance at the map will explain why European\r\ncivilisation began in Greece. The Hellenes had penetrated the region\r\nin which there was constant contact with all the varied cultures of the\r\nolder world. Although they destroyed the AEgean culture, they could not\r\nlive amidst its ruins without receiving some influence. Then the traders\r\nof Phoenicia, triumphing in the fall of their AEgean rivals, brought the\r\ngreat pacific cultural influence of commerce to bear on them. After\r\nsome hundreds of years of internal trouble, barbaric quarrels, and fresh\r\narrivals from the north, Greece began to wear an aspect of civilisation.\r\nMany of the Greeks passed to Asia Minor, as they increased, and, freed\r\nfrom the despotism of tradition, in living contact with the luxury and\r\nculture of Persia, which had advanced as far as Europe, they evolved the\r\nfine civilisation of the Greek colonies, and reacted on the motherland.\r\nFinally, there came the heroic struggle against the Persian invaders,\r\nand from the ashes of their early civilisation arose the marble city\r\nwhich will never die in the memory of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Romans had meantime been advancing. We may neglect the older Italian\r\nculture, as it had far less to do with the making of Italy and Europe\r\nthan the influence of the east. By about 500 B.C. Rome was a small\r\nkingdom with a primitive civilisation, busy in subduing the neighbouring\r\ntribes who threatened its security, and unconsciously gathering the\r\nseeds of culture which some of them contained. By about 300 B.C. the\r\nvigour of the Romans had united all the tribes of Italy in a powerful\r\nrepublic, and wealth began to accumulate at Rome. Not far to the east\r\nwas the glittering civilisation of Greece; to the south was Carthage, a\r\nbusy centre of commerce, navigation, and art; and from the Mediterranean\r\ncame processions of ships bringing stimulating fragments and stories\r\nof the hoary culture of the east. Within another two hundred years Rome\r\nannihilated Carthage, paralysed and overran Greece, and sent its legions\r\nover the Asiatic provinces of the older empires. By the beginning of\r\nthe Christian Era all that remained of the culture of the old world was\r\ngathered in Rome. All the philosophies of Greece, all the religions\r\nof Persia and Judea and Egypt, all the luxuries and vices of the east,\r\nfound a home in it. Every stream of culture that had started from the\r\nlater and higher Neolithic age had ended in Rome.\r\n\r\nAnd in the meantime Rome had begun to disseminate its heritage over\r\nEurope. Its legions poured over Spain and Gaul and Germany and Britain.\r\nIts administrators and judges and teachers followed the eagles, and set\r\nup schools and law-courts and theatres and baths and temples. It flung\r\nbroad roads to the north of Britain and the banks of the Rhine and\r\nDanube. Under the shelter of the \"Roman Peace\" the peoples of Europe\r\ncould spare men from the plough and the sword for the cultivation of art\r\nand letters. The civilisations of Britain, France, Germany, Spain, North\r\nAfrica, and Italy were ushered into the calendar of mankind, and were\r\nready to bear the burden when the mighty city on the Tiber let the\r\nsceptre fall from its enfeebled hands.\r\n\r\nRome fell. The more accurate historians of our time correct the old\r\nlegend of death from senile decay or from the effect of dissipation.\r\nRaces of men, like races of animals, do not die; they are killed. The\r\nphysical deterioration of the citizens of Rome was a small matter in its\r\nfall. Fiscal and imperial blunders loosed the frame of its empire. The\r\nresources were still there, but there was none to organise and unify\r\nthem. The imperial system--or chaos--ruined Rome. And just when the\r\ndemoralisation was greatest, and the Teutonic tribes at the frontiers\r\nwere most numerous and powerful, an accident shook the system. A fierce\r\nand numerous people from Asia, the Huns, wandered into Europe, threw\r\nthemselves on the Teutonic tribes, and precipitated these tribes upon\r\nthe Empire. A Diocletian might still have saved the Empire, but there\r\nwas none to guide it. The northern barbarians trod its civilisation\r\nunderfoot, and Europe passed into the Dark Ages.\r\n\r\nOne more application of the evolutionary principle, and we close the\r\nstory. The \"barbarians\"--the Goths and Vandals and their Germanic\r\ncousins--were barbaric only in comparison with the art and letters\r\nof Rome. They had law, polity, and ideals. European civilisation owes\r\nelements to them, as well as to Rome. To say simply that the barbarians\r\ndestroyed the institutions of Rome is no adequate explanation of the\r\nDark Ages. Let us see rather how the Dark Ages were enlightened.\r\n\r\nIt is now fully recognised that the reawakening of Europe in the twelfth\r\nand thirteenth centuries was very largely due to a fresh culture-contact\r\nwith the older civilisations. The Arabs had, on becoming civilised,\r\nlearned from the Nestorians, who had been driven out of the Greek world\r\nfor their heresies, the ancient culture of Greece. They enshrined it\r\nin a brilliant civilisation which it inspired them to establish. By the\r\nninth century this civilisation was exhibited in Spain by its Moorish\r\nconquerors, and, as its splendour increased, it attracted the attention\r\nof Europe. Some Christian scholars visited Spain, as time went on, but\r\nthe Jews were the great intermediaries in disseminating its culture\r\nin Europe. There is now no question about the fact that the rebirth of\r\npositive learning, especially of science, in Europe was very largely due\r\nto the literature of the Moors, and their luxury and splendour gave an\r\nimpulse to European art. Europe entered upon the remarkable intellectual\r\nperiod known as Scholasticism. Besides this stimulus, it must be\r\nremembered, the scholars of Europe had at least a certain number of old\r\nLatin writers whose works had survived the general wreck of culture.\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth century the awakening of Europe was completed. The\r\nTurks took Constantinople, and drove large numbers of Greek scholars to\r\nItaly. Out of this catastrophe issued the great Renaissance, or rebirth,\r\nof art, science, and letters in Italy, and then in France, Germany,\r\nand England. In the new intellectual ferment there appeared the great\r\nartists, great thinkers and inventors, and great navigators who led the\r\nrace to fresh heights. The invention of printing alone would almost have\r\nchanged the face of Europe. But it was accompanied by a hundred\r\nother inventions and discoveries, by great liberating and stimulating\r\nmovements like the Reformation, by the growth of free and wealthy\r\ncities, and by the extension of peace over larger areas, and the\r\nconcentration of wealth and encouragement of art which the growth and\r\nsettlement of the chief European powers involved. Europe entered upon\r\nthe phase of evolution which we call modern times.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThe future of humanity cannot be seen even darkly, as in a glass. No\r\nforecast that aspires beyond the immediate future is worth considering\r\nseriously. If it be a forecast of material progress, it is rendered\r\nworthless by the obvious consideration that if we knew what the future\r\nwill do, we would do it ourselves. If it is a forecast of intellectual\r\nand social evolution, it is inevitably coloured by the intellectual\r\nor social convictions of the prophet. I therefore abstain wholly from\r\ncarrying the story of evolution beyond realities. But I would add two\r\ngeneral considerations which may enable a reflective reader to answer\r\ncertain questions that will arise in his mind at the close of this\r\nsurvey of the story of evolution.\r\n\r\nAre we evolving to-day? Is man the last word of evolution? These are\r\namongst the commonest questions put to me. Whether man is or is not the\r\nlast word of evolution is merely a verbal quibble. Now that language is\r\ninvented, and things have names, one may say that the name \"man\" will\r\ncling to the highest and most progressive animal on earth, no matter how\r\nmuch he may rise above the man of to-day. But if the question is\r\nwhether he WILL rise far above the civilisation of to-day, we can, in\r\nmy opinion, give a confident answer. There is no law of evolution, but\r\nthere is a fact of evolution. Ten million years ago the highest animal\r\non the earth was a reptile, or, at the most, a low, rat-like marsupial.\r\nThe authorities tell us that, unless some cosmic accident intervene, the\r\nearth will remain habitable by man for at least ten million years. It\r\nis safe to conclude that the man of that remote age will be lifted above\r\nthe man of to-day as much as we transcend the reptile in intelligence\r\nand emotion. It is most probable that this is a quite inadequate\r\nexpression of the future advance. We are not only evolving, but evolving\r\nmore rapidly than living thing ever did before. The pace increases\r\nevery century. A calm and critical review of our development inspires a\r\nconviction that a few centuries will bring about the realisation of the\r\nhighest dream that ever haunted the mind of the prophet. What splendours\r\nlie beyond that, the most soaring imagination cannot have the dimmest\r\nperception.\r\n\r\nAnd the last word must meet an anxiety that arises out of this very\r\nconfidence. Darwin was right. It is--not exclusively, but mainly--the\r\nstruggle for life that has begotten higher types. Must every step of\r\nfuture progress be won by fresh and sustained struggle? At least we may\r\nsay that the notion that progress in the future depends, as in the past,\r\nupon the pitting of flesh against flesh, and tooth against tooth, is\r\na deplorable illusion. Such physical struggle is indeed necessary to\r\nevolve and maintain a type fit for the struggle. But a new thing has\r\ncome into the story of the earth--wisdom and fine emotion. The processes\r\nwhich begot animal types in the past may be superseded; perhaps must be\r\nsuperseded. The battle of the future lies between wit and wit, art and\r\nart, generosity and generosity; and a great struggle and rivalry may\r\nproceed that will carry the distinctive powers of man to undreamed-of\r\nheights, yet be wholly innocent of the passion-lit, blood-stained\r\nconflict that has hitherto been the instrument of progress.",
