And thou, too,\r\nMinerva, from whose hand the olive sprung;\r\nAnd boy-discoverer of the curved plough;\r\nAnd, bearing a young cypress root-uptorn,\r\nSilvanus, and Gods all and Goddesses,\r\nWho make the fields your care, both ye who nurse\r\nThe tender unsown increase, and from heaven\r\nShed on man's sowing the riches of your rain:\r\nAnd thou, even thou, of whom we know not yet\r\nWhat mansion of the skies shall hold thee soon,\r\nWhether to watch o'er cities be thy will,\r\nGreat Caesar, and to take the earth in charge,\r\nThat so the mighty world may welcome thee\r\nLord of her increase, master of her times,\r\nBinding thy mother's myrtle round thy brow,\r\nOr as the boundless ocean's God thou come,\r\nSole dread of seamen, till far Thule bow\r\nBefore thee, and Tethys win thee to her son\r\nWith all her waves for dower; or as a star\r\nLend thy fresh beams our lagging months to cheer,\r\nWhere 'twixt the Maid and those pursuing Claws\r\nA space is opening; see! red Scorpio's self\r\nHis arms draws in, yea, and hath left thee more\r\nThan thy full meed of heaven: be what thou wilt-\r\nFor neither Tartarus hopes to call thee king,\r\nNor may so dire a lust of sovereignty\r\nE'er light upon thee, howso Greece admire\r\nElysium's fields, and Proserpine not heed\r\nHer mother's voice entreating to return-\r\nVouchsafe a prosperous voyage, and smile on this\r\nMy bold endeavour, and pitying, even as I,\r\nThese poor way-wildered swains, at once begin,\r\nGrow timely used unto the voice of prayer.\r\n  In early spring-tide, when the icy drip\r\nMelts from the mountains hoar, and Zephyr's breath\r\nUnbinds the crumbling clod, even then 'tis time;\r\nPress deep your plough behind the groaning ox,\r\nAnd teach the furrow-burnished share to shine.\r\nThat land the craving farmer's prayer fulfils,\r\nWhich twice the sunshine, twice the frost has felt;\r\nAy, that's the land whose boundless harvest-crops\r\nBurst, see! the barns.\r\n                       But ere our metal cleave\r\nAn unknown surface, heed we to forelearn\r\nThe winds and varying temper of the sky,\r\nThe lineal tilth and habits of the spot,\r\nWhat every region yields, and what denies.\r\nHere blithelier springs the corn, and here the grape,\r\nThere earth is green with tender growth of trees\r\nAnd grass unbidden. See how from Tmolus comes\r\nThe saffron's fragrance, ivory from Ind,\r\nFrom Saba's weakling sons their frankincense,\r\nIron from the naked Chalybs, castor rank\r\nFrom Pontus, from Epirus the prize-palms\r\nO' the mares of Elis.\r\n                       Such the eternal bond\r\nAnd such the laws by Nature's hand imposed\r\nOn clime and clime, e'er since the primal dawn\r\nWhen old Deucalion on the unpeopled earth\r\nCast stones, whence men, a flinty race, were reared.\r\nUp then! if fat the soil, let sturdy bulls\r\nUpturn it from the year's first opening months,\r\nAnd let the clods lie bare till baked to dust\r\nBy the ripe suns of summer; but if the earth\r\nLess fruitful just ere Arcturus rise\r\nWith shallower trench uptilt it- 'twill suffice;\r\nThere, lest weeds choke the crop's luxuriance, here,\r\nLest the scant moisture fail the barren sand.\r\n   Then thou shalt suffer in alternate years\r\nThe new-reaped fields to rest, and on the plain\r\nA crust of sloth to harden; or, when stars\r\nAre changed in heaven, there sow the golden grain\r\nWhere erst, luxuriant with its quivering pod,\r\nPulse, or the slender vetch-crop, thou hast cleared,\r\nAnd lupin sour, whose brittle stalks arise,\r\nA hurtling forest. For the plain is parched\r\nBy flax-crop, parched by oats, by poppies parched\r\nIn Lethe-slumber drenched. Nathless by change\r\nThe travailing earth is lightened, but stint not\r\nWith refuse rich to soak the thirsty soil,\r\nAnd shower foul ashes o'er the exhausted fields.\r\nThus by rotation like repose is gained,\r\nNor earth meanwhile uneared and thankless left.\r\nOft, too, 'twill boot to fire the naked fields,\r\nAnd the light stubble burn with crackling flames;\r\nWhether that earth therefrom some hidden strength\r\nAnd fattening food derives, or that the fire\r\nBakes every blemish out, and sweats away\r\nEach useless humour, or that the heat unlocks\r\nNew passages and secret pores, whereby\r\nTheir life-juice to the tender blades may win;\r\nOr that it hardens more and helps to bind\r\nThe gaping veins, lest penetrating showers,\r\nOr fierce sun's ravening might, or searching blast\r\nOf the keen north should sear them. Well, I wot,\r\nHe serves the fields who with his harrow breaks\r\nThe sluggish clods, and hurdles osier-twined\r\nHales o'er them; from the far Olympian height\r\nHim golden Ceres not in vain regards;\r\nAnd he, who having ploughed the fallow plain\r\nAnd heaved its furrowy ridges, turns once more\r\nCross-wise his shattering share, with stroke on stroke\r\nThe earth assails, and makes the field his thrall.\r\n  Pray for wet summers and for winters fine,\r\nYe husbandmen; in winter's dust the crops\r\nExceedingly rejoice, the field hath joy;\r\nNo tilth makes Mysia lift her head so high,\r\nNor Gargarus his own harvests so admire.\r\nWhy tell of him, who, having launched his seed,\r\nSets on for close encounter, and rakes smooth\r\nThe dry dust hillocks, then on the tender corn\r\nLets in the flood, whose waters follow fain;\r\nAnd when the parched field quivers, and all the blades\r\nAre dying, from the brow of its hill-bed,\r\nSee! see! he lures the runnel; down it falls,\r\nWaking hoarse murmurs o'er the polished stones,\r\nAnd with its bubblings slakes the thirsty fields?\r\nOr why of him, who lest the heavy ears\r\nO'erweigh the stalk, while yet in tender blade\r\nFeeds down the crop's luxuriance, when its growth\r\nFirst tops the furrows? Why of him who drains\r\nThe marsh-land's gathered ooze through soaking sand,\r\nChiefly what time in treacherous moons a stream\r\nGoes out in spate, and with its coat of slime\r\nHolds all the country, whence the hollow dykes\r\nSweat steaming vapour?\r\n                       But no whit the more\r\nFor all expedients tried and travail borne\r\nBy man and beast in turning oft the soil,\r\nDo greedy goose and Strymon-haunting cranes\r\nAnd succory's bitter fibres cease to harm,\r\nOr shade not injure. The great Sire himself\r\nNo easy road to husbandry assigned,\r\nAnd first was he by human skill to rouse\r\nThe slumbering glebe, whetting the minds of men\r\nWith care on care, nor suffering realm of his\r\nIn drowsy sloth to stagnate. Before Jove\r\nFields knew no taming hand of husbandmen;\r\nTo mark the plain or mete with boundary-line-\r\nEven this was impious; for the common stock\r\nThey gathered, and the earth of her own will\r\nAll things more freely, no man bidding, bore.\r\nHe to black serpents gave their venom-bane,\r\nAnd bade the wolf go prowl, and ocean toss;\r\nShook from the leaves their honey, put fire away,\r\nAnd curbed the random rivers running wine,\r\nThat use by gradual dint of thought on thought\r\nMight forge the various arts, with furrow's help\r\nThe corn-blade win, and strike out hidden fire\r\nFrom the flint's heart. Then first the streams were ware\r\nOf hollowed alder-hulls: the sailor then\r\nTheir names and numbers gave to star and star,\r\nPleiads and Hyads, and Lycaon's child\r\nBright Arctos; how with nooses then was found\r\nTo catch wild beasts, and cozen them with lime,\r\nAnd hem with hounds the mighty forest-glades.\r\nSoon one with hand-net scourges the broad stream,\r\nProbing its depths, one drags his dripping toils\r\nAlong the main; then iron's unbending might,\r\nAnd shrieking saw-blade,- for the men of old\r\nWith wedges wont to cleave the splintering log;-\r\nThen divers arts arose; toil conquered all,\r\nRemorseless toil, and poverty's shrewd push\r\nIn times of hardship. Ceres was the first\r\nSet mortals on with tools to turn the sod,\r\nWhen now the awful groves 'gan fail to bear\r\nAcorns and arbutes, and her wonted food\r\nDodona gave no more. Soon, too, the corn\r\nGat sorrow's increase, that an evil blight\r\nAte up the stalks, and thistle reared his spines\r\nAn idler in the fields; the crops die down;\r\nUpsprings instead a shaggy growth of burrs\r\nAnd caltrops; and amid the corn-fields trim\r\nUnfruitful darnel and wild oats have sway.\r\nWherefore, unless thou shalt with ceaseless rake\r\nThe weeds pursue, with shouting scare the birds,\r\nPrune with thy hook the dark field's matted shade,\r\nPray down the showers, all vainly thou shalt eye,\r\nAlack! thy neighbour's heaped-up harvest-mow,\r\nAnd in the greenwood from a shaken oak\r\nSeek solace for thine hunger.\r\n                       Now to tell\r\nThe sturdy rustics' weapons, what they are,\r\nWithout which, neither can be sown nor reared\r\nThe fruits of harvest; first the bent plough's share\r\nAnd heavy timber, and slow-lumbering wains\r\nOf the Eleusinian mother, threshing-sleighs\r\nAnd drags, and harrows with their crushing weight;\r\nThen the cheap wicker-ware of Celeus old,\r\nHurdles of arbute, and thy mystic fan,\r\nIacchus; which, full tale, long ere the time\r\nThou must with heed lay by, if thee await\r\nNot all unearned the country's crown divine.\r\nWhile yet within the woods, the elm is tamed\r\nAnd bowed with mighty force to form the stock,\r\nAnd take the plough's curved shape, then nigh the root\r\nA pole eight feet projecting, earth-boards twain,\r\nAnd share-beam with its double back they fix.\r\nFor yoke is early hewn a linden light,\r\nAnd a tall beech for handle, from behind\r\nTo turn the car at lowest: then o'er the hearth\r\nThe wood they hang till the smoke knows it well.\r\n  Many the precepts of the men of old\r\nI can recount thee, so thou start not back,\r\nAnd such slight cares to learn not weary thee.\r\nAnd this among the first: thy threshing-floor\r\nWith ponderous roller must be levelled smooth,\r\nAnd wrought by hand, and fixed with binding chalk,\r\nLest weeds arise, or dust a passage win\r\nSplitting the surface, then a thousand plagues\r\nMake sport of it: oft builds the tiny mouse\r\nHer home, and plants her granary, underground,\r\nOr burrow for their bed the purblind moles,\r\nOr toad is found in hollows, and all the swarm\r\nOf earth's unsightly creatures; or a huge\r\nCorn-heap the weevil plunders, and the ant,\r\nFearful of coming age and penury.\r\n  Mark too, what time the walnut in the woods\r\nWith ample bloom shall clothe her, and bow down\r\nHer odorous branches, if the fruit prevail,\r\nLike store of grain will follow, and there shall come\r\nA mighty winnowing-time with mighty heat;\r\nBut if the shade with wealth of leaves abound,\r\nVainly your threshing-floor will bruise the stalks\r\nRich but in chaff. Many myself have seen\r\nSteep, as they sow, their pulse-seeds, drenching them\r\nWith nitre and black oil-lees, that the fruit\r\nMight swell within the treacherous pods, and they\r\nMake speed to boil at howso small a fire.\r\nYet, culled with caution, proved with patient toil,\r\nThese have I seen degenerate, did not man\r\nPut forth his hand with power, and year by year\r\nChoose out the largest. So, by fate impelled,\r\nSpeed all things to the worse, and backward borne\r\nGlide from us; even as who with struggling oars\r\nUp stream scarce pulls a shallop, if he chance\r\nHis arms to slacken, lo! with headlong force\r\nThe current sweeps him down the hurrying tide.\r\n  Us too behoves Arcturus' sign observe,\r\nAnd the Kids' seasons and the shining Snake,\r\nNo less than those who o'er the windy main\r\nBorne homeward tempt the Pontic, and the jaws\r\nOf oyster-rife Abydos. When the Scales\r\nNow poising fair the hours of sleep and day\r\nGive half the world to sunshine, half to shade,\r\nThen urge your bulls, my masters; sow the plain\r\nEven to the verge of tameless winter's showers\r\nWith barley: then, too, time it is to hide\r\nYour flax in earth, and poppy, Ceres' joy,\r\nAye, more than time to bend above the plough,\r\nWhile earth, yet dry, forbids not, and the clouds\r\nAre buoyant. With the spring comes bean-sowing;\r\nThee, too, Lucerne, the crumbling furrows then\r\nReceive, and millet's annual care returns,\r\nWhat time the white bull with his gilded horns\r\nOpens the year, before whose threatening front,\r\nRouted the dog-star sinks. But if it be\r\nFor wheaten harvest and the hardy spelt,\r\nThou tax the soil, to corn-ears wholly given,\r\nLet Atlas' daughters hide them in the dawn,\r\nThe Cretan star, a crown of fire, depart,\r\nOr e'er the furrow's claim of seed thou quit,\r\nOr haste thee to entrust the whole year's hope\r\nTo earth that would not. Many have begun\r\nEre Maia's star be setting; these, I trow,\r\nTheir looked-for harvest fools with empty ears.\r\nBut if the vetch and common kidney-bean\r\nThou'rt fain to sow, nor scorn to make thy care\r\nPelusiac lentil, no uncertain sign\r\nBootes' fall will send thee; then begin,\r\nPursue thy sowing till half the frosts be done.\r\n  Therefore it is the golden sun, his course\r\nInto fixed parts dividing, rules his way\r\nThrough the twelve constellations of the world.\r\nFive zones the heavens contain; whereof is one\r\nAye red with flashing sunlight, fervent aye\r\nFrom fire; on either side to left and right\r\nAre traced the utmost twain, stiff with blue ice,\r\nAnd black with scowling storm-clouds, and betwixt\r\nThese and the midmost, other twain there lie,\r\nBy the Gods' grace to heart-sick mortals given,\r\nAnd a path cleft between them, where might wheel\r\nOn sloping plane the system of the Signs.\r\nAnd as toward Scythia and Rhipaean heights\r\nThe world mounts upward, likewise sinks it down\r\nToward Libya and the south, this pole of ours\r\nStill towering high, that other, 'neath their feet,\r\nBy dark Styx frowned on, and the abysmal shades.\r\nHere glides the huge Snake forth with sinuous coils\r\n'Twixt the two Bears and round them river-wise-\r\nThe Bears that fear 'neath Ocean's brim to dip.\r\nThere either, say they, reigns the eternal hush\r\nOf night that knows no seasons, her black pall\r\nThick-mantling fold on fold; or thitherward\r\nFrom us returning Dawn brings back the day;\r\nAnd when the first breath of his panting steeds\r\nOn us the Orient flings, that hour with them\r\nRed Vesper 'gins to trim his his 'lated fires.\r\nHence under doubtful skies forebode we can\r\nThe coming tempests, hence both harvest-day\r\nAnd seed-time, when to smite the treacherous main\r\nWith driving oars, when launch the fair-rigged fleet,\r\nOr in ripe hour to fell the forest-pine.\r\nHence, too, not idly do we watch the stars-\r\nTheir rising and their setting-and the year,\r\nFour varying seasons to one law conformed.\r\n  If chilly showers e'er shut the farmer's door,\r\nMuch that had soon with sunshine cried for haste,\r\nHe may forestall; the ploughman batters keen\r\nHis blunted share's hard tooth, scoops from a tree\r\nHis troughs, or on the cattle stamps a brand,\r\nOr numbers on the corn-heaps; some make sharp\r\nThe stakes and two-pronged forks, and willow-bands\r\nAmerian for the bending vine prepare.\r\nNow let the pliant basket plaited be\r\nOf bramble-twigs; now set your corn to parch\r\nBefore the fire; now bruise it with the stone.\r\nNay even on holy days some tasks to ply\r\nIs right and lawful: this no ban forbids,\r\nTo turn the runnel's course, fence corn-fields in,\r\nMake springes for the birds, burn up the briars,\r\nAnd plunge in wholesome stream the bleating flock.\r\nOft too with oil or apples plenty-cheap\r\nThe creeping ass's ribs his driver packs,\r\nAnd home from town returning brings instead\r\nA dented mill-stone or black lump of pitch.\r\n  The moon herself in various rank assigns\r\nThe days for labour lucky: fly the fifth;\r\nThen sprang pale Orcus and the Eumenides;\r\nEarth then in awful labour brought to light\r\nCoeus, Iapetus, and Typhoeus fell,\r\nAnd those sworn brethren banded to break down\r\nThe gates of heaven; thrice, sooth to say, they strove\r\nOssa on Pelion's top to heave and heap,\r\nAye, and on Ossa to up-roll amain\r\nLeafy Olympus; thrice with thunderbolt\r\nTheir mountain-stair the Sire asunder smote.\r\nSeventh after tenth is lucky both to set\r\nThe vine in earth, and take and tame the steer,\r\nAnd fix the leashes to the warp; the ninth\r\nTo runagates is kinder, cross to thieves.\r\n  Many the tasks that lightlier lend themselves\r\nIn chilly night, or when the sun is young,\r\nAnd Dawn bedews the world. By night 'tis best\r\nTo reap light stubble, and parched fields by night;\r\nFor nights the suppling moisture never fails.\r\nAnd one will sit the long late watches out\r\nBy winter fire-light, shaping with keen blade\r\nThe torches to a point; his wife the while,\r\nHer tedious labour soothing with a song,\r\nSpeeds the shrill comb along the warp, or else\r\nWith Vulcan's aid boils the sweet must-juice down,\r\nAnd skims with leaves the quivering cauldron's wave.\r\n  But ruddy Ceres in mid heat is mown,\r\nAnd in mid heat the parched ears are bruised\r\nUpon the floor; to plough strip, strip to sow;\r\nWinter's the lazy time for husbandmen.\r\nIn the cold season farmers wont to taste\r\nThe increase of their toil, and yield themselves\r\nTo mutual interchange of festal cheer.\r\nBoon winter bids them, and unbinds their cares,\r\nAs laden keels, when now the port they touch,\r\nAnd happy sailors crown the sterns with flowers.\r\nNathless then also time it is to strip\r\nAcorns from oaks, and berries from the bay,\r\nOlives, and bleeding myrtles, then to set\r\nSnares for the crane, and meshes for the stag,\r\nAnd hunt the long-eared hares, then pierce the doe\r\nWith whirl of hempen-thonged Balearic sling,\r\nWhile snow lies deep, and streams are drifting ice.\r\n  What need to tell of autumn's storms and stars,\r\nAnd wherefore men must watch, when now the day\r\nGrows shorter, and more soft the summer's heat?\r\nWhen Spring the rain-bringer comes rushing down,\r\nOr when the beards of harvest on the plain\r\nBristle already, and the milky corn\r\nOn its green stalk is swelling? Many a time,\r\nWhen now the farmer to his yellow fields\r\nThe reaping-hind came bringing, even in act\r\nTo lop the brittle barley stems, have I\r\nSeen all the windy legions clash in war\r\nTogether, as to rend up far and wide\r\nThe heavy corn-crop from its lowest roots,\r\nAnd toss it skyward: so might winter's flaw,\r\nDark-eddying, whirl light stalks and flying straws.\r\n  Oft too comes looming vast along the sky\r\nA march of waters; mustering from above,\r\nThe clouds roll up the tempest, heaped and grim\r\nWith angry showers: down falls the height of heaven,\r\nAnd with a great rain floods the smiling crops,\r\nThe oxen's labour: now the dikes fill fast,\r\nAnd the void river-beds swell thunderously,\r\nAnd all the panting firths of Ocean boil.\r\nThe Sire himself in midnight of the clouds\r\nWields with red hand the levin; through all her bulk\r\nEarth at the hurly quakes; the beasts are fled,\r\nAnd mortal hearts of every kindred sunk\r\nIn cowering terror; he with flaming brand\r\nAthos, or Rhodope, or Ceraunian crags\r\nPrecipitates: then doubly raves the South\r\nWith shower on blinding shower, and woods and coasts\r\nWail fitfully beneath the mighty blast.\r\nThis fearing, mark the months and Signs of heaven,\r\nWhither retires him Saturn's icy star,\r\nAnd through what heavenly cycles wandereth\r\nThe glowing orb Cyllenian. Before all\r\nWorship the Gods, and to great Ceres pay\r\nHer yearly dues upon the happy sward\r\nWith sacrifice, anigh the utmost end\r\nOf winter, and when Spring begins to smile.\r\nThen lambs are fat, and wines are mellowest then;\r\nThen sleep is sweet, and dark the shadows fall\r\nUpon the mountains. Let your rustic youth\r\nTo Ceres do obeisance, one and all;\r\nAnd for her pleasure thou mix honeycombs\r\nWith milk and the ripe wine-god; thrice for luck\r\nAround the young corn let the victim go,\r\nAnd all the choir, a joyful company,\r\nAttend it, and with shouts bid Ceres come\r\nTo be their house-mate; and let no man dare\r\nPut sickle to the ripened ears until,\r\nWith woven oak his temples chapleted,\r\nHe foot the rugged dance and chant the lay.\r\n  Aye, and that these things we might win to know\r\nBy certain tokens, heats, and showers, and winds\r\nThat bring the frost, the Sire of all himself\r\nOrdained what warnings in her monthly round\r\nThe moon should give, what bodes the south wind's fall,\r\nWhat oft-repeated sights the herdsman seeing\r\nShould keep his cattle closer to their stalls.\r\nNo sooner are the winds at point to rise,\r\nThan either Ocean's firths begin to toss\r\nAnd swell, and a dry crackling sound is heard\r\nUpon the heights, or one loud ferment booms\r\nThe beach afar, and through the forest goes\r\nA murmur multitudinous. By this\r\nScarce can the billow spare the curved keels,\r\nWhen swift the sea-gulls from the middle main\r\nCome winging, and their shrieks are shoreward borne,\r\nWhen ocean-loving cormorants on dry land\r\nBesport them, and the hern, her marshy haunts\r\nForsaking, mounts above the soaring cloud.\r\nOft, too, when wind is toward, the stars thou'lt see\r\nFrom heaven shoot headlong, and through murky night\r\nLong trails of fire white-glistening in their wake,\r\nOr light chaff flit in air with fallen leaves,\r\nOr feathers on the wave-top float and play.\r\nBut when from regions of the furious North\r\nIt lightens, and when thunder fills the halls\r\nOf Eurus and of Zephyr, all the fields\r\nWith brimming dikes are flooded, and at sea\r\nNo mariner but furls his dripping sails.\r\nNever at unawares did shower annoy:\r\nOr, as it rises, the high-soaring cranes\r\nFlee to the vales before it, with face\r\nUpturned to heaven, the heifer snuffs the gale\r\nThrough gaping nostrils, or about the meres\r\nShrill-twittering flits the swallow, and the frogs\r\nCrouch in the mud and chant their dirge of old.\r\nOft, too, the ant from out her inmost cells,\r\nFretting the narrow path, her eggs conveys;\r\nOr the huge bow sucks moisture; or a host\r\nOf rooks from food returning in long line\r\nClamour with jostling wings. Now mayst thou see\r\nThe various ocean-fowl and those that pry\r\nRound Asian meads within thy fresher-pools,\r\nCayster, as in eager rivalry,\r\nAbout their shoulders dash the plenteous spray,\r\nNow duck their head beneath the wave, now run\r\nInto the billows, for sheer idle joy\r\nOf their mad bathing-revel. Then the crow\r\nWith full voice, good-for-naught, inviting rain,\r\nStalks on the dry sand mateless and alone.\r\nNor e'en the maids, that card their nightly task,\r\nKnow not the storm-sign, when in blazing crock\r\nThey see the lamp-oil sputtering with a growth\r\nOf mouldy snuff-clots.\r\n                       So too, after rain,\r\nSunshine and open skies thou mayst forecast,\r\nAnd learn by tokens sure, for then nor dimmed\r\nAppear the stars' keen edges, nor the moon\r\nAs borrowing of her brother's beams to rise,\r\nNor fleecy films to float along the sky.\r\nNot to the sun's warmth then upon the shore\r\nDo halcyons dear to Thetis ope their wings,\r\nNor filthy swine take thought to toss on high\r\nWith scattering snout the straw-wisps. But the clouds\r\nSeek more the vales, and rest upon the plain,\r\nAnd from the roof-top the night-owl for naught\r\nWatching the sunset plies her 'lated song.\r\nDistinct in clearest air is Nisus seen\r\nTowering, and Scylla for the purple lock\r\nPays dear; for whereso, as she flies, her wings\r\nThe light air winnow, lo! fierce, implacable,\r\nNisus with mighty whirr through heaven pursues;\r\nWhere Nisus heavenward soareth, there her wings\r\nClutch as she flies, the light air winnowing still.\r\nSoft then the voice of rooks from indrawn throat\r\nThrice, four times, o'er repeated, and full oft\r\nOn their high cradles, by some hidden joy\r\nGladdened beyond their wont, in bustling throngs\r\nAmong the leaves they riot; so sweet it is,\r\nWhen showers are spent, their own loved nests again\r\nAnd tender brood to visit. Not, I deem,\r\nThat heaven some native wit to these assigned,\r\nOr fate a larger prescience, but that when\r\nThe storm and shifting moisture of the air\r\nHave changed their courses, and the sky-god now,\r\nWet with the south-wind, thickens what was rare,\r\nAnd what was gross releases, then, too, change\r\nTheir spirits' fleeting phases, and their breasts\r\nFeel other motions now, than when the wind\r\nWas driving up the cloud-rack. Hence proceeds\r\nThat blending of the feathered choirs afield,\r\nThe cattle's exultation, and the rooks'\r\nDeep-throated triumph.\r\n                       But if the headlong sun\r\nAnd moons in order following thou regard,\r\nNe'er will to-morrow's hour deceive thee, ne'er\r\nWilt thou be caught by guile of cloudless night.\r\nWhen first the moon recalls her rallying fires,\r\nIf dark the air clipped by her crescent dim,\r\nFor folks afield and on the open sea\r\nA mighty rain is brewing; but if her face\r\nWith maiden blush she mantle, 'twill be wind,\r\nFor wind turns Phoebe still to ruddier gold.\r\nBut if at her fourth rising, for 'tis that\r\nGives surest counsel, clear she ride thro' heaven\r\nWith horns unblunted, then shall that whole day,\r\nAnd to the month's end those that spring from it,\r\nRainless and windless be, while safe ashore\r\nShall sailors pay their vows to Panope,\r\nGlaucus, and Melicertes, Ino's child.\r\n  The sun too, both at rising, and when soon\r\nHe dives beneath the waves, shall yield thee signs;\r\nFor signs, none trustier, travel with the sun,\r\nBoth those which in their course with dawn he brings,\r\nAnd those at star-rise. When his springing orb\r\nWith spots he pranketh, muffled in a cloud,\r\nAnd shrinks mid-circle, then of showers beware;\r\nFor then the South comes driving from the deep,\r\nTo trees and crops and cattle bringing bane.\r\nOr when at day-break through dark clouds his rays\r\nBurst and are scattered, or when rising pale\r\nAurora quits Tithonus' saffron bed,\r\nBut sorry shelter then, alack I will yield\r\nVine-leaf to ripening grapes; so thick a hail\r\nIn spiky showers spins rattling on the roof.\r\nAnd this yet more 'twill boot thee bear in mind,\r\nWhen now, his course upon Olympus run,\r\nHe draws to his decline: for oft we see\r\nUpon the sun's own face strange colours stray;\r\nDark tells of rain, of east winds fiery-red;\r\nIf spots with ruddy fire begin to mix,\r\nThen all the heavens convulsed in wrath thou'lt see-\r\nStorm-clouds and wind together. Me that night\r\nLet no man bid fare forth upon the deep,\r\nNor rend the rope from shore. But if, when both\r\nHe brings again and hides the day's return,\r\nClear-orbed he shineth, idly wilt thou dread\r\nThe storm-clouds, and beneath the lustral North\r\nSee the woods waving. What late eve in fine\r\nBears in her bosom, whence the wind that brings\r\nFair-weather-clouds, or what the rain South\r\nIs meditating, tokens of all these\r\nThe sun will give thee. Who dare charge the sun\r\nWith leasing? He it is who warneth oft\r\nOf hidden broils at hand and treachery,\r\nAnd secret swelling of the waves of war.\r\nHe too it was, when Caesar's light was quenched,\r\nFor Rome had pity, when his bright head he veiled\r\nIn iron-hued darkness, till a godless age\r\nTrembled for night eternal; at that time\r\nHowbeit earth also, and the ocean-plains,\r\nAnd dogs obscene, and birds of evil bode\r\nGave tokens. Yea, how often have we seen\r\nEtna, her furnace-walls asunder riven,\r\nIn billowy floods boil o'er the Cyclops' fields,\r\nAnd roll down globes of fire and molten rocks!\r\nA clash of arms through all the heaven was heard\r\nBy Germany; strange heavings shook the Alps.\r\nYea, and by many through the breathless groves\r\nA voice was heard with power, and wondrous-pale\r\nPhantoms were seen upon the dusk of night,\r\nAnd cattle spake, portentous! streams stand still,\r\nAnd the earth yawns asunder, ivory weeps\r\nFor sorrow in the shrines, and bronzes sweat.\r\nUp-twirling forests with his eddying tide,\r\nMadly he bears them down, that lord of floods,\r\nEridanus, till through all the plain are swept\r\nBeasts and their stalls together. At that time\r\nIn gloomy entrails ceased not to appear\r\nDark-threatening fibres, springs to trickle blood,\r\nAnd high-built cities night-long to resound\r\nWith the wolves' howling. Never more than then\r\nFrom skies all cloudless fell the thunderbolts,\r\nNor blazed so oft the comet's fire of bale.\r\nTherefore a second time Philippi saw\r\nThe Roman hosts with kindred weapons rush\r\nTo battle, nor did the high gods deem it hard\r\nThat twice Emathia and the wide champaign\r\nOf Haemus should be fattening with our blood.\r\nAy, and the time will come when there anigh,\r\nHeaving the earth up with his curved plough,\r\nSome swain will light on javelins by foul rust\r\nCorroded, or with ponderous harrow strike\r\nOn empty helmets, while he gapes to see\r\nBones as of giants from the trench untombed.\r\nGods of my country, heroes of the soil,\r\nAnd Romulus, and Mother Vesta, thou\r\nWho Tuscan Tiber and Rome's Palatine\r\nPreservest, this new champion at the least\r\nOur fallen generation to repair\r\nForbid not. To the full and long ago\r\nOur blood thy Trojan perjuries hath paid,\r\nLaomedon. Long since the courts of heaven\r\nBegrudge us thee, our Caesar, and complain\r\nThat thou regard'st the triumphs of mankind,\r\nHere where the wrong is right, the right is wrong,\r\nWhere wars abound so many, and myriad-faced\r\nIs crime; where no meet honour hath the plough;\r\nThe fields, their husbandmen led far away,\r\nRot in neglect, and curved pruning-hooks\r\nInto the sword's stiff blade are fused and forged.\r\nEuphrates here, here Germany new strife\r\nIs stirring; neighbouring cities are in arms,\r\nThe laws that bound them snapped; and godless war\r\nRages through all the universe; as when\r\nThe four-horse chariots from the barriers poured\r\nStill quicken o'er the course, and, idly now\r\nGrasping the reins, the driver by his team\r\nIs onward borne, nor heeds the car his curb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGIC II\r\n\r\nThus far the tilth of fields and stars of heaven;\r\nNow will I sing thee, Bacchus, and, with thee,\r\nThe forest's young plantations and the fruit\r\nOf slow-maturing olive. Hither haste,\r\nO Father of the wine-press; all things here\r\nTeem with the bounties of thy hand; for thee\r\nWith viny autumn laden blooms the field,\r\nAnd foams the vintage high with brimming vats;\r\nHither, O Father of the wine-press, come,\r\nAnd stripped of buskin stain thy bared limbs\r\nIn the new must with me.\r\n                       First, nature's law\r\nFor generating trees is manifold;\r\nFor some of their own force spontaneous spring,\r\nNo hand of man compelling, and possess\r\nThe plains and river-windings far and wide,\r\nAs pliant osier and the bending broom,\r\nPoplar, and willows in wan companies\r\nWith green leaf glimmering gray; and some there be\r\nFrom chance-dropped seed that rear them, as the tall\r\nChestnuts, and, mightiest of the branching wood,\r\nJove's Aesculus, and oaks, oracular\r\nDeemed by the Greeks of old. With some sprouts forth\r\nA forest of dense suckers from the root,\r\nAs elms and cherries; so, too, a pigmy plant,\r\nBeneath its mother's mighty shade upshoots\r\nThe bay-tree of Parnassus. Such the modes\r\nNature imparted first; hence all the race\r\nOf forest-trees and shrubs and sacred groves\r\nSprings into verdure.\r\n                       Other means there are,\r\nWhich use by method for itself acquired.\r\nOne, sliving suckers from the tender frame\r\nOf the tree-mother, plants them in the trench;\r\nOne buries the bare stumps within his field,\r\nTruncheons cleft four-wise, or sharp-pointed stakes;\r\nSome forest-trees the layer's bent arch await,\r\nAnd slips yet quick within the parent-soil;\r\nNo root need others, nor doth the pruner's hand\r\nShrink to restore the topmost shoot to earth\r\nThat gave it being. Nay, marvellous to tell,\r\nLopped of its limbs, the olive, a mere stock,\r\nStill thrusts its root out from the sapless wood,\r\nAnd oft the branches of one kind we see\r\nChange to another's with no loss to rue,\r\nPear-tree transformed the ingrafted apple yield,\r\nAnd stony cornels on the plum-tree blush.\r\n  Come then, and learn what tilth to each belongs\r\nAccording to their kinds, ye husbandmen,\r\nAnd tame with culture the wild fruits, lest earth\r\nLie idle. O blithe to make all Ismarus\r\nOne forest of the wine-god, and to clothe\r\nWith olives huge Tabernus! And be thou\r\nAt hand, and with me ply the voyage of toil\r\nI am bound on, O my glory, O thou that art\r\nJustly the chiefest portion of my fame,\r\nMaecenas, and on this wide ocean launched\r\nSpread sail like wings to waft thee. Not that I\r\nWith my poor verse would comprehend the whole,\r\nNay, though a hundred tongues, a hundred mouths\r\nWere mine, a voice of iron; be thou at hand,\r\nSkirt but the nearer coast-line; see the shore\r\nIs in our grasp; not now with feigned song\r\nThrough winding bouts and tedious preludings\r\nShall I detain thee.\r\n                       Those that lift their head\r\nInto the realms of light spontaneously,\r\nFruitless indeed, but blithe and strenuous spring,\r\nSince Nature lurks within the soil. And yet\r\nEven these, should one engraft them, or transplant\r\nTo well-drilled trenches, will anon put of\r\nTheir woodland temper, and, by frequent tilth,\r\nTo whatso craft thou summon them, make speed\r\nTo follow. So likewise will the barren shaft\r\nThat from the stock-root issueth, if it be\r\nSet out with clear space amid open fields:\r\nNow the tree-mother's towering leaves and boughs\r\nDarken, despoil of increase as it grows,\r\nAnd blast it in the bearing. Lastly, that\r\nWhich from shed seed ariseth, upward wins\r\nBut slowly, yielding promise of its shade\r\nTo late-born generations; apples wane\r\nForgetful of their former juice, the grape\r\nBears sorry clusters, for the birds a prey.\r\n  Soothly on all must toil be spent, and all\r\nTrained to the trench and at great cost subdued.\r\nBut reared from truncheons olives answer best,\r\nAs vines from layers, and from the solid wood\r\nThe Paphian myrtles; while from suckers spring\r\nBoth hardy hazels and huge ash, the tree\r\nThat rims with shade the brows of Hercules,\r\nAnd acorns dear to the Chaonian sire:\r\nSo springs the towering palm too, and the fir\r\nDestined to spy the dangers of the deep.\r\nBut the rough arbutus with walnut-fruit\r\nIs grafted; so have barren planes ere now\r\nStout apples borne, with chestnut-flower the beech,\r\nThe mountain-ash with pear-bloom whitened o'er,\r\nAnd swine crunched acorns 'neath the boughs of elms.\r\n  Nor is the method of inserting eyes\r\nAnd grafting one: for where the buds push forth\r\nAmidst the bark, and burst the membranes thin,\r\nEven on the knot a narrow rift is made,\r\nWherein from some strange tree a germ they pen,\r\nAnd to the moist rind bid it cleave and grow.\r\nOr, otherwise, in knotless trunks is hewn\r\nA breach, and deep into the solid grain\r\nA path with wedges cloven; then fruitful slips\r\nAre set herein, and- no long time- behold!\r\nTo heaven upshot with teeming boughs, the tree\r\nStrange leaves admires and fruitage not its own.\r\n  Nor of one kind alone are sturdy elms,\r\nWillow and lotus, nor the cypress-trees\r\nOf Ida; nor of self-same fashion spring\r\nFat olives, orchades, and radii\r\nAnd bitter-berried pausians, no, nor yet\r\nApples and the forests of Alcinous;\r\nNor from like cuttings are Crustumian pears\r\nAnd Syrian, and the heavy hand-fillers.\r\nNot the same vintage from our trees hangs down,\r\nWhich Lesbos from Methymna's tendril plucks.\r\nVines Thasian are there, Mareotids white,\r\nThese apt for richer soils, for lighter those:\r\nPsithian for raisin-wine more useful, thin\r\nLageos, that one day will try the feet\r\nAnd tie the tongue: purples and early-ripes,\r\nAnd how, O Rhaetian, shall I hymn thy praise?\r\nYet cope not therefore with Falernian bins.\r\nVines Aminaean too, best-bodied wine,\r\nTo which the Tmolian bows him, ay, and king\r\nPhanaeus too, and, lesser of that name,\r\nArgitis, wherewith not a grape can vie\r\nFor gush of wine-juice or for length of years.\r\nNor thee must I pass over, vine of Rhodes,\r\nWelcomed by gods and at the second board,\r\nNor thee, Bumastus, with plump clusters swollen.\r\nBut lo! how many kinds, and what their names,\r\nThere is no telling, nor doth it boot to tell;\r\nWho lists to know it, he too would list to learn\r\nHow many sand-grains are by Zephyr tossed\r\nOn Libya's plain, or wot, when Eurus falls\r\nWith fury on the ships, how many waves\r\nCome rolling shoreward from the Ionian sea.\r\n  Not that all soils can all things bear alike.\r\nWillows by water-courses have their birth,\r\nAlders in miry fens; on rocky heights\r\nThe barren mountain-ashes; on the shore\r\nMyrtles throng gayest; Bacchus, lastly, loves\r\nThe bare hillside, and yews the north wind's chill.\r\nMark too the earth by outland tillers tamed,\r\nAnd Eastern homes of Arabs, and tattooed\r\nGeloni; to all trees their native lands\r\nAllotted are; no clime but India bears\r\nBlack ebony; the branch of frankincense\r\nIs Saba's sons' alone; why tell to thee\r\nOf balsams oozing from the perfumed wood,\r\nOr berries of acanthus ever green?\r\nOf Aethiop forests hoar with downy wool,\r\nOr how the Seres comb from off the leaves\r\nTheir silky fleece? Of groves which India bears,\r\nOcean's near neighbour, earth's remotest nook,\r\nWhere not an arrow-shot can cleave the air\r\nAbove their tree-tops? yet no laggards they,\r\nWhen girded with the quiver! Media yields\r\nThe bitter juices and slow-lingering taste\r\nOf the blest citron-fruit, than which no aid\r\nComes timelier, when fierce step-dames drug the cup\r\nWith simples mixed and spells of baneful power,\r\nTo drive the deadly poison from the limbs.\r\nLarge the tree's self in semblance like a bay,\r\nAnd, showered it not a different scent abroad,\r\nA bay it had been; for no wind of heaven\r\nIts foliage falls; the flower, none faster, clings;\r\nWith it the Medes for sweetness lave the lips,\r\nAnd ease the panting breathlessness of age.\r\n  But no, not Mede-land with its wealth of woods,\r\nNor Ganges fair, and Hermus thick with gold,\r\nCan match the praise of Italy; nor Ind,\r\nNor Bactria, nor Panchaia, one wide tract\r\nOf incense-teeming sand. Here never bulls\r\nWith nostrils snorting fire upturned the sod\r\nSown with the monstrous dragon's teeth, nor crop\r\nOf warriors bristled thick with lance and helm;\r\nBut heavy harvests and the Massic juice\r\nOf Bacchus fill its borders, overspread\r\nWith fruitful flocks and olives. Hence arose\r\nThe war-horse stepping proudly o'er the plain;\r\nHence thy white flocks, Clitumnus, and the bull,\r\nOf victims mightiest, which full oft have led,\r\nBathed in thy sacred stream, the triumph-pomp\r\nOf Romans to the temples of the gods.\r\nHere blooms perpetual spring, and summer here\r\nIn months that are not summer's; twice teem the flocks;\r\nTwice doth the tree yield service of her fruit.\r\nBut ravening tigers come not nigh, nor breed\r\nOf savage lion, nor aconite betrays\r\nIts hapless gatherers, nor with sweep so vast\r\nDoth the scaled serpent trail his endless coils\r\nAlong the ground, or wreathe him into spires.\r\nMark too her cities, so many and so proud,\r\nOf mighty toil the achievement, town on town\r\nUp rugged precipices heaved and reared,\r\nAnd rivers undergliding ancient walls.\r\nOr should I celebrate the sea that laves\r\nHer upper shores and lower? or those broad lakes?\r\nThee, Larius, greatest and, Benacus, thee\r\nWith billowy uproar surging like the main?\r\nOr sing her harbours, and the barrier cast\r\nAthwart the Lucrine, and how ocean chafes\r\nWith mighty bellowings, where the Julian wave\r\nEchoes the thunder of his rout, and through\r\nAvernian inlets pours the Tuscan tide?\r\nA land no less that in her veins displays\r\nRivers of silver, mines of copper ore,\r\nAy, and with gold hath flowed abundantly.\r\nA land that reared a valiant breed of men,\r\nThe Marsi and Sabellian youth, and, schooled\r\nTo hardship, the Ligurian, and with these\r\nThe Volscian javelin-armed, the Decii too,\r\nThe Marii and Camilli, names of might,\r\nThe Scipios, stubborn warriors, ay, and thee,\r\nGreat Caesar, who in Asia's utmost bounds\r\nWith conquering arm e'en now art fending far\r\nThe unwarlike Indian from the heights of Rome.\r\nHail! land of Saturn, mighty mother thou\r\nOf fruits and heroes; 'tis for thee I dare\r\nUnseal the sacred fountains, and essay\r\nThemes of old art and glory, as I sing\r\nThe song of Ascra through the towns of Rome.\r\n  Now for the native gifts of various soils,\r\nWhat powers hath each, what hue, what natural bent\r\nFor yielding increase. First your stubborn lands\r\nAnd churlish hill-sides, where are thorny fields\r\nOf meagre marl and gravel, these delight\r\nIn long-lived olive-groves to Pallas dear.\r\nTake for a sign the plenteous growth hard by\r\nOf oleaster, and the fields strewn wide\r\nWith woodland berries. But a soil that's rich,\r\nIn moisture sweet exulting, and the plain\r\nThat teems with grasses on its fruitful breast,\r\nSuch as full oft in hollow mountain-dell\r\nWe view beneath us- from the craggy heights\r\nStreams thither flow with fertilizing mud-\r\nA plain which southward rising feeds the fern\r\nBy curved ploughs detested, this one day\r\nShall yield thee store of vines full strong to gush\r\nIn torrents of the wine-god; this shall be\r\nFruitful of grapes and flowing juice like that\r\nWe pour to heaven from bowls of gold, what time\r\nThe sleek Etruscan at the altar blows\r\nHis ivory pipe, and on the curved dish\r\nWe lay the reeking entrails. If to rear\r\nCattle delight thee rather, steers, or lambs,\r\nOr goats that kill the tender plants, then seek\r\nFull-fed Tarentum's glades and distant fields,\r\nOr such a plain as luckless Mantua lost\r\nWhose weedy water feeds the snow-white swan:\r\nThere nor clear springs nor grass the flocks will fail,\r\nAnd all the day-long browsing of thy herds\r\nShall the cool dews of one brief night repair.\r\nLand which the burrowing share shows dark and rich,\r\nWith crumbling soil- for this we counterfeit\r\nIn ploughing- for corn is goodliest; from no field\r\nMore wains thou'lt see wend home with plodding steers;\r\nOr that from which the husbandman in spleen\r\nHas cleared the timber, and o'erthrown the copse\r\nThat year on year lay idle, and from the roots\r\nUptorn the immemorial haunt of birds;\r\nThey banished from their nests have sought the skies;\r\nBut the rude plain beneath the ploughshare's stroke\r\nStarts into sudden brightness. For indeed\r\nThe starved hill-country gravel scarce serves the bees\r\nWith lowly cassias and with rosemary;\r\nRough tufa and chalk too, by black water-worms\r\nGnawed through and through, proclaim no soils beside\r\nSo rife with serpent-dainties, or that yield\r\nSuch winding lairs to lurk in. That again,\r\nWhich vapoury mist and flitting smoke exhales,\r\nDrinks moisture up and casts it forth at will,\r\nWhich, ever in its own green grass arrayed,\r\nMars not the metal with salt scurf of rust-\r\nThat shall thine elms with merry vines enwreathe;\r\nThat teems with olive; that shall thy tilth prove kind\r\nTo cattle, and patient of the curved share.\r\nSuch ploughs rich Capua, such the coast that skirts\r\nThy ridge, Vesuvius, and the Clanian flood,\r\nAcerrae's desolation and her bane.\r\nHow each to recognize now hear me tell.\r\nDost ask if loose or passing firm it be-\r\nSince one for corn hath liking, one for wine,\r\nThe firmer sort for Ceres, none too loose\r\nFor thee, Lyaeus?- with scrutinizing eye\r\nFirst choose thy ground, and bid a pit be sunk\r\nDeep in the solid earth, then cast the mould\r\nAll back again, and stamp the surface smooth.\r\nIf it suffice not, loose will be the land,\r\nMore meet for cattle and for kindly vines;\r\nBut if, rebellious, to its proper bounds\r\nThe soil returns not, but fills all the trench\r\nAnd overtops it, then the glebe is gross;\r\nLook for stiff ridges and reluctant clods,\r\nAnd with strong bullocks cleave the fallow crust.\r\nSalt ground again, and bitter, as 'tis called-\r\nBarren for fruits, by tilth untamable,\r\nNor grape her kind, nor apples their good name\r\nMaintaining- will in this wise yield thee proof:\r\nStout osier-baskets from the rafter-smoke,\r\nAnd strainers of the winepress pluck thee down;\r\nHereinto let that evil land, with fresh\r\nSpring-water mixed, be trampled to the full;\r\nThe moisture, mark you, will ooze all away,\r\nIn big drops issuing through the osier-withes,\r\nBut plainly will its taste the secret tell,\r\nAnd with a harsh twang ruefully distort\r\nThe mouths of them that try it. Rich soil again\r\nWe learn on this wise: tossed from hand to hand\r\nYet cracks it never, but pitch-like, as we hold,\r\nClings to the fingers. A land with moisture rife\r\nBreeds lustier herbage, and is more than meet\r\nProlific. Ah I may never such for me\r\nO'er-fertile prove, or make too stout a show\r\nAt the first earing! Heavy land or light\r\nThe mute self-witness of its weight betrays.\r\nA glance will serve to warn thee which is black,\r\nOr what the hue of any. But hard it is\r\nTo track the signs of that pernicious cold:\r\nPines only, noxious yews, and ivies dark\r\nAt times reveal its traces.\r\n                      All these rules\r\nRegarding, let your land, ay, long before,\r\nScorch to the quick, and into trenches carve\r\nThe mighty mountains, and their upturned clods\r\nBare to the north wind, ere thou plant therein\r\nThe vine's prolific kindred. Fields whose soil\r\nIs crumbling are the best: winds look to that,\r\nAnd bitter hoar-frosts, and the delver's toil\r\nUntiring, as he stirs the loosened glebe.\r\nBut those, whose vigilance no care escapes,\r\nSearch for a kindred site, where first to rear\r\nA nursery for the trees, and eke whereto\r\nSoon to translate them, lest the sudden shock\r\nFrom their new mother the young plants estrange.\r\nNay, even the quarter of the sky they brand\r\nUpon the bark, that each may be restored,\r\nAs erst it stood, here bore the southern heats,\r\nHere turned its shoulder to the northern pole;\r\nSo strong is custom formed in early years.\r\nWhether on hill or plain 'tis best to plant\r\nYour vineyard first inquire. If on some plain\r\nYou measure out rich acres, then plant thick;\r\nThick planting makes no niggard of the vine;\r\nBut if on rising mound or sloping bill,\r\nThen let the rows have room, so none the less\r\nEach line you draw, when all the trees are set,\r\nMay tally to perfection. Even as oft\r\nIn mighty war, whenas the legion's length\r\nDeploys its cohorts, and the column stands\r\nIn open plain, the ranks of battle set,\r\nAnd far and near with rippling sheen of arms\r\nThe wide earth flickers, nor yet in grisly strife\r\nFoe grapples foe, but dubious 'twixt the hosts\r\nThe war-god wavers; so let all be ranged\r\nIn equal rows symmetric, not alone\r\nTo feed an idle fancy with the view,\r\nBut since not otherwise will earth afford\r\nVigour to all alike, nor yet the boughs\r\nHave power to stretch them into open space.\r\n  Shouldst haply of the furrow's depth inquire,\r\nEven to a shallow trench I dare commit\r\nThe vine; but deeper in the ground is fixed\r\nThe tree that props it, aesculus in chief,\r\nWhich howso far its summit soars toward heaven,\r\nSo deep strikes root into the vaults of hell.\r\nIt therefore neither storms, nor blasts, nor showers\r\nWrench from its bed; unshaken it abides,\r\nSees many a generation, many an age\r\nOf men roll onward, and survives them all,\r\nStretching its titan arms and branches far,\r\nSole central pillar of a world of shade.\r\n  Nor toward the sunset let thy vineyards slope,\r\nNor midst the vines plant hazel; neither take\r\nThe topmost shoots for cuttings, nor from the top\r\nOf the supporting tree your suckers tear;\r\nSo deep their love of earth; nor wound the plants\r\nWith blunted blade; nor truncheons intersperse\r\nOf the wild olive: for oft from careless swains\r\nA spark hath fallen, that, 'neath the unctuous rind\r\nHid thief-like first, now grips the tough tree-bole,\r\nAnd mounting to the leaves on high, sends forth\r\nA roar to heaven, then coursing through the boughs\r\nAnd airy summits reigns victoriously,\r\nWraps all the grove in robes of fire, and gross\r\nWith pitch-black vapour heaves the murky reek\r\nSkyward, but chiefly if a storm has swooped\r\nDown on the forest, and a driving wind\r\nRolls up the conflagration. When 'tis so,\r\nTheir root-force fails them, nor, when lopped away,\r\nCan they recover, and from the earth beneath\r\nSpring to like verdure; thus alone survives\r\nThe bare wild olive with its bitter leaves.\r\n  Let none persuade thee, howso weighty-wise,\r\nTo stir the soil when stiff with Boreas' breath.\r\nThen ice-bound winter locks the fields, nor lets\r\nThe young plant fix its frozen root to earth.\r\nBest sow your vineyards when in blushing Spring\r\nComes the white bird long-bodied snakes abhor,\r\nOr on the eve of autumn's earliest frost,\r\nEre the swift sun-steeds touch the wintry Signs,\r\nWhile summer is departing. Spring it is\r\nBlesses the fruit-plantation, Spring the groves;\r\nIn Spring earth swells and claims the fruitful seed.\r\nThen Aether, sire omnipotent, leaps down\r\nWith quickening showers to his glad wife's embrace,\r\nAnd, might with might commingling, rears to life\r\nAll germs that teem within her; then resound\r\nWith songs of birds the greenwood-wildernesses,\r\nAnd in due time the herds their loves renew;\r\nThen the boon earth yields increase, and the fields\r\nUnlock their bosoms to the warm west winds;\r\nSoft moisture spreads o'er all things, and the blades\r\nFace the new suns, and safely trust them now;\r\nThe vine-shoot, fearless of the rising south,\r\nOr mighty north winds driving rain from heaven,\r\nBursts into bud, and every leaf unfolds.\r\nEven so, methinks, when Earth to being sprang,\r\nDawned the first days, and such the course they held;\r\n'Twas Spring-tide then, ay, Spring, the mighty world\r\nWas keeping: Eurus spared his wintry blasts,\r\nWhen first the flocks drank sunlight, and a race\r\nOf men like iron from the hard glebe arose,\r\nAnd wild beasts thronged the woods, and stars the heaven.\r\nNor could frail creatures bear this heavy strain,\r\nDid not so large a respite interpose\r\n'Twixt frost and heat, and heaven's relenting arms\r\nYield earth a welcome.\r\n                       For the rest, whate'er\r\nThe sets thou plantest in thy fields, thereon\r\nStrew refuse rich, and with abundant earth\r\nTake heed to hide them, and dig in withal\r\nRough shells or porous stone, for therebetween\r\nWill water trickle and fine vapour creep,\r\nAnd so the plants their drooping spirits raise.\r\nAye, and there have been, who with weight of stone\r\nOr heavy potsherd press them from above;\r\nThis serves for shield in pelting showers, and this\r\nWhen the hot dog-star chaps the fields with drought.\r\n  The slips once planted, yet remains to cleave\r\nThe earth about their roots persistently,\r\nAnd toss the cumbrous hoes, or task the soil\r\nWith burrowing plough-share, and ply up and down\r\nYour labouring bullocks through the vineyard's midst,\r\nThen too smooth reeds and shafts of whittled wand,\r\nAnd ashen poles and sturdy forks to shape,\r\nWhereby supported they may learn to mount,\r\nLaugh at the gales, and through the elm-tops win\r\nFrom story up to story.\r\n                       Now while yet\r\nThe leaves are in their first fresh infant growth,\r\nForbear their frailty, and while yet the bough\r\nShoots joyfully toward heaven, with loosened rein\r\nLaunched on the void, assail it not as yet\r\nWith keen-edged sickle, but let the leaves alone\r\nBe culled with clip of fingers here and there.\r\nBut when they clasp the elms with sturdy trunks\r\nErect, then strip the leaves off, prune the boughs;\r\nSooner they shrink from steel, but then put forth\r\nThe arm of power, and stem the branchy tide.\r\n  Hedges too must be woven and all beasts\r\nBarred entrance, chiefly while the leaf is young\r\nAnd witless of disaster; for therewith,\r\nBeside harsh winters and o'erpowering sun,\r\nWild buffaloes and pestering goats for ay\r\nBesport them, sheep and heifers glut their greed.\r\nNor cold by hoar-frost curdled, nor the prone\r\nDead weight of summer upon the parched crags,\r\nSo scathe it, as the flocks with venom-bite\r\nOf their hard tooth, whose gnawing scars the stem.\r\nFor no offence but this to Bacchus bleeds\r\nThe goat at every altar, and old plays\r\nUpon the stage find entrance; therefore too\r\nThe sons of Theseus through the country-side-\r\nHamlet and crossway- set the prize of wit,\r\nAnd on the smooth sward over oiled skins\r\nDance in their tipsy frolic. Furthermore\r\nThe Ausonian swains, a race from Troy derived,\r\nMake merry with rough rhymes and boisterous mirth,\r\nGrim masks of hollowed bark assume, invoke\r\nThee with glad hymns, O Bacchus, and to thee\r\nHang puppet-faces on tall pines to swing.\r\nHence every vineyard teems with mellowing fruit,\r\nTill hollow vale o'erflows, and gorge profound,\r\nWhere'er the god hath turned his comely head.\r\nTherefore to Bacchus duly will we sing\r\nMeet honour with ancestral hymns, and cates\r\nAnd dishes bear him; and the doomed goat\r\nLed by the horn shall at the altar stand,\r\nWhose entrails rich on hazel-spits we'll roast.\r\n  This further task again, to dress the vine,\r\nHath needs beyond exhausting; the whole soil\r\nThrice, four times, yearly must be cleft, the sod\r\nWith hoes reversed be crushed continually,\r\nThe whole plantation lightened of its leaves.\r\nRound on the labourer spins the wheel of toil,\r\nAs on its own track rolls the circling year.\r\nSoon as the vine her lingering leaves hath shed,\r\nAnd the chill north wind from the forests shook\r\nTheir coronal, even then the careful swain\r\nLooks keenly forward to the coming year,\r\nWith Saturn's curved fang pursues and prunes\r\nThe vine forlorn, and lops it into shape.\r\nBe first to dig the ground up, first to clear\r\nAnd burn the refuse-branches, first to house\r\nAgain your vine-poles, last to gather fruit.\r\nTwice doth the thickening shade beset the vine,\r\nTwice weeds with stifling briers o'ergrow the crop;\r\nAnd each a toilsome labour. Do thou praise\r\nBroad acres, farm but few. Rough twigs beside\r\nOf butcher's broom among the woods are cut,\r\nAnd reeds upon the river-banks, and still\r\nThe undressed willow claims thy fostering care.\r\nSo now the vines are fettered, now the trees\r\nLet go the sickle, and the last dresser now\r\nSings of his finished rows; but still the ground\r\nMust vexed be, the dust be stirred, and heaven\r\nStill set thee trembling for the ripened grapes.\r\n  Not so with olives; small husbandry need they,\r\nNor look for sickle bowed or biting rake,\r\nWhen once they have gripped the soil, and borne the breeze.\r\nEarth of herself, with hooked fang laid bare,\r\nYields moisture for the plants, and heavy fruit,\r\nThe ploughshare aiding; therewithal thou'lt rear\r\nThe olive's fatness well-beloved of Peace.\r\n  Apples, moreover, soon as first they feel\r\nTheir stems wax lusty, and have found their strength,\r\nTo heaven climb swiftly, self-impelled, nor crave\r\nOur succour. All the grove meanwhile no less\r\nWith fruit is swelling, and the wild haunts of birds\r\nBlush with their blood-red berries. Cytisus\r\nIs good to browse on, the tall forest yields\r\nPine-torches, and the nightly fires are fed\r\nAnd shoot forth radiance. And shall men be loath\r\nTo plant, nor lavish of their pains? Why trace\r\nThings mightier? Willows even and lowly brooms\r\nTo cattle their green leaves, to shepherds shade,\r\nFences for crops, and food for honey yield.\r\nAnd blithe it is Cytorus to behold\r\nWaving with box, Narycian groves of pitch;\r\nOh! blithe the sight of fields beholden not\r\nTo rake or man's endeavour! the barren woods\r\nThat crown the scalp of Caucasus, even these,\r\nWhich furious blasts for ever rive and rend,\r\nYield various wealth, pine-logs that serve for ships,\r\nCedar and cypress for the homes of men;\r\nHence, too, the farmers shave their wheel-spokes, hence\r\nDrums for their wains, and curved boat-keels fit;\r\nWillows bear twigs enow, the elm-tree leaves,\r\nMyrtle stout spear-shafts, war-tried cornel too;\r\nYews into Ituraean bows are bent:\r\nNor do smooth lindens or lathe-polished box\r\nShrink from man's shaping and keen-furrowing steel;\r\nLight alder floats upon the boiling flood\r\nSped down the Padus, and bees house their swarms\r\nIn rotten holm-oak's hollow bark and bole.\r\nWhat of like praise can Bacchus' gifts afford?\r\nNay, Bacchus even to crime hath prompted, he\r\nThe wine-infuriate Centaurs quelled with death,\r\nRhoetus and Pholus, and with mighty bowl\r\nHylaeus threatening high the Lapithae.\r\n  Oh! all too happy tillers of the soil,\r\nCould they but know their blessedness, for whom\r\nFar from the clash of arms all-equal earth\r\nPours from the ground herself their easy fare!\r\nWhat though no lofty palace portal-proud\r\nFrom all its chambers vomits forth a tide\r\nOf morning courtiers, nor agape they gaze\r\nOn pillars with fair tortoise-shell inwrought,\r\nGold-purfled robes, and bronze from Ephyre;\r\nNor is the whiteness of their wool distained\r\nWith drugs Assyrian, nor clear olive's use\r\nWith cassia tainted; yet untroubled calm,\r\nA life that knows no falsehood, rich enow\r\nWith various treasures, yet broad-acred ease,\r\nGrottoes and living lakes, yet Tempes cool,\r\nLowing of kine, and sylvan slumbers soft,\r\nThey lack not; lawns and wild beasts' haunts are there,\r\nA youth of labour patient, need-inured,\r\nWorship, and reverend sires: with them from earth\r\nDeparting justice her last footprints left.\r\n  Me before all things may the Muses sweet,\r\nWhose rites I bear with mighty passion pierced,\r\nReceive, and show the paths and stars of heaven,\r\nThe sun's eclipses and the labouring moons,\r\nFrom whence the earthquake, by what power the seas\r\nSwell from their depths, and, every barrier burst,\r\nSink back upon themselves, why winter-suns\r\nSo haste to dip 'neath ocean, or what check\r\nThe lingering night retards. But if to these\r\nHigh realms of nature the cold curdling blood\r\nAbout my heart bar access, then be fields\r\nAnd stream-washed vales my solace, let me love\r\nRivers and woods, inglorious. Oh for you\r\nPlains, and Spercheius, and Taygete,\r\nBy Spartan maids o'er-revelled! Oh, for one,\r\nWould set me in deep dells of Haemus cool,\r\nAnd shield me with his boughs' o'ershadowing might!\r\nHappy, who had the skill to understand\r\nNature's hid causes, and beneath his feet\r\nAll terrors cast, and death's relentless doom,\r\nAnd the loud roar of greedy Acheron.\r\nBlest too is he who knows the rural gods,\r\nPan, old Silvanus, and the sister-nymphs!\r\nHim nor the rods of public power can bend,\r\nNor kingly purple, nor fierce feud that drives\r\nBrother to turn on brother, nor descent\r\nOf Dacian from the Danube's leagued flood,\r\nNor Rome's great State, nor kingdoms like to die;\r\nNor hath he grieved through pitying of the poor,\r\nNor envied him that hath. What fruit the boughs,\r\nAnd what the fields, of their own bounteous will\r\nHave borne, he gathers; nor iron rule of laws,\r\nNor maddened Forum have his eyes beheld,\r\nNor archives of the people. Others vex\r\nThe darksome gulfs of Ocean with their oars,\r\nOr rush on steel: they press within the courts\r\nAnd doors of princes; one with havoc falls\r\nUpon a city and its hapless hearths,\r\nFrom gems to drink, on Tyrian rugs to lie;\r\nThis hoards his wealth and broods o'er buried gold;\r\nOne at the rostra stares in blank amaze;\r\nOne gaping sits transported by the cheers,\r\nThe answering cheers of plebs and senate rolled\r\nAlong the benches: bathed in brothers' blood\r\nMen revel, and, all delights of hearth and home\r\nFor exile changing, a new country seek\r\nBeneath an alien sun. The husbandman\r\nWith hooked ploughshare turns the soil; from hence\r\nSprings his year's labour; hence, too, he sustains\r\nCountry and cottage homestead, and from hence\r\nHis herds of cattle and deserving steers.\r\nNo respite! still the year o'erflows with fruit,\r\nOr young of kine, or Ceres' wheaten sheaf,\r\nWith crops the furrow loads, and bursts the barns.\r\nWinter is come: in olive-mills they bruise\r\nThe Sicyonian berry; acorn-cheered\r\nThe swine troop homeward; woods their arbutes yield;\r\nSo, various fruit sheds Autumn, and high up\r\nOn sunny rocks the mellowing vintage bakes.\r\nMeanwhile about his lips sweet children cling;\r\nHis chaste house keeps its purity; his kine\r\nDrop milky udders, and on the lush green grass\r\nFat kids are striving, horn to butting horn.\r\nHimself keeps holy days; stretched o'er the sward,\r\nWhere round the fire his comrades crown the bowl,\r\nHe pours libation, and thy name invokes,\r\nLenaeus, and for the herdsmen on an elm\r\nSets up a mark for the swift javelin; they\r\nStrip their tough bodies for the rustic sport.\r\nSuch life of yore the ancient Sabines led,\r\nSuch Remus and his brother: Etruria thus,\r\nDoubt not, to greatness grew, and Rome became\r\nThe fair world's fairest, and with circling wall\r\nClasped to her single breast the sevenfold hills.\r\nAy, ere the reign of Dicte's king, ere men,\r\nWaxed godless, banqueted on slaughtered bulls,\r\nSuch life on earth did golden Saturn lead.\r\nNor ear of man had heard the war-trump's blast,\r\nNor clang of sword on stubborn anvil set.\r\n  But lo! a boundless space we have travelled o'er;\r\n'Tis time our steaming horses to unyoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGIC III\r\n\r\nThee too, great Pales, will I hymn, and thee,\r\nAmphrysian shepherd, worthy to be sung,\r\nYou, woods and waves Lycaean. All themes beside,\r\nWhich else had charmed the vacant mind with song,\r\nAre now waxed common. Of harsh Eurystheus who\r\nThe story knows not, or that praiseless king\r\nBusiris, and his altars? or by whom\r\nHath not the tale been told of Hylas young,\r\nLatonian Delos and Hippodame,\r\nAnd Pelops for his ivory shoulder famed,\r\nKeen charioteer? Needs must a path be tried,\r\nBy which I too may lift me from the dust,\r\nAnd float triumphant through the mouths of men.\r\nYea, I shall be the first, so life endure,\r\nTo lead the Muses with me, as I pass\r\nTo mine own country from the Aonian height;\r\nI, Mantua, first will bring thee back the palms\r\nOf Idumaea, and raise a marble shrine\r\nOn thy green plain fast by the water-side,\r\nWhere Mincius winds more vast in lazy coils,\r\nAnd rims his margent with the tender reed.\r\nAmid my shrine shall Caesar's godhead dwell.\r\nTo him will I, as victor, bravely dight\r\nIn Tyrian purple, drive along the bank\r\nA hundred four-horse cars. All Greece for me,\r\nLeaving Alpheus and Molorchus' grove,\r\nOn foot shall strive, or with the raw-hide glove;\r\nWhilst I, my head with stripped green olive crowned,\r\nWill offer gifts. Even 'tis present joy\r\nTo lead the high processions to the fane,\r\nAnd view the victims felled; or how the scene\r\nSunders with shifted face, and Britain's sons\r\nInwoven thereon with those proud curtains rise.\r\nOf gold and massive ivory on the doors\r\nI'll trace the battle of the Gangarides,\r\nAnd our Quirinus' conquering arms, and there\r\nSurging with war, and hugely flowing, the Nile,\r\nAnd columns heaped on high with naval brass.\r\nAnd Asia's vanquished cities I will add,\r\nAnd quelled Niphates, and the Parthian foe,\r\nWho trusts in flight and backward-volleying darts,\r\nAnd trophies torn with twice triumphant hand\r\nFrom empires twain on ocean's either shore.\r\nAnd breathing forms of Parian marble there\r\nShall stand, the offspring of Assaracus,\r\nAnd great names of the Jove-descended folk,\r\nAnd father Tros, and Troy's first founder, lord\r\nOf Cynthus. And accursed Envy there\r\nShall dread the Furies, and thy ruthless flood,\r\nCocytus, and Ixion's twisted snakes,\r\nAnd that vast wheel and ever-baffling stone.\r\nMeanwhile the Dryad-haunted woods and lawns\r\nUnsullied seek we; 'tis thy hard behest,\r\nMaecenas. Without thee no lofty task\r\nMy mind essays. Up! break the sluggish bonds\r\nOf tarriance; with loud din Cithaeron calls,\r\nSteed-taming Epidaurus, and thy hounds,\r\nTaygete; and hark! the assenting groves\r\nWith peal on peal reverberate the roar.\r\nYet must I gird me to rehearse ere long\r\nThe fiery fights of Caesar, speed his name\r\nThrough ages, countless as to Caesar's self\r\nFrom the first birth-dawn of Tithonus old.\r\n  If eager for the prized Olympian palm\r\nOne breed the horse, or bullock strong to plough,\r\nBe his prime care a shapely dam to choose.\r\nOf kine grim-faced is goodliest, with coarse head\r\nAnd burly neck, whose hanging dewlaps reach\r\nFrom chin to knee; of boundless length her flank;\r\nLarge every way she is, large-footed even,\r\nWith incurved horns and shaggy ears beneath.\r\nNor let mislike me one with spots of white\r\nConspicuous, or that spurns the yoke, whose horn\r\nAt times hath vice in't: liker bull-faced she,\r\nAnd tall-limbed wholly, and with tip of tail\r\nBrushing her footsteps as she walks along.\r\nThe age for Hymen's rites, Lucina's pangs,\r\nEre ten years ended, after four begins;\r\nTheir residue of days nor apt to teem,\r\nNor strong for ploughing. Meantime, while youth's delight\r\nSurvives within them, loose the males: be first\r\nTo speed thy herds of cattle to their loves,\r\nBreed stock with stock, and keep the race supplied.\r\nAh! life's best hours are ever first to fly\r\nFrom hapless mortals; in their place succeed\r\nDisease and dolorous eld; till travail sore\r\nAnd death unpitying sweep them from the scene.\r\nStill will be some, whose form thou fain wouldst change;\r\nRenew them still; with yearly choice of young\r\nPreventing losses, lest too late thou rue.\r\n  Nor steeds crave less selection; but on those\r\nThou think'st to rear, the promise of their line,\r\nFrom earliest youth thy chiefest pains bestow.\r\nSee from the first yon high-bred colt afield,\r\nHis lofty step, his limbs' elastic tread:\r\nDauntless he leads the herd, still first to try\r\nThe threatening flood, or brave the unknown bridge,\r\nBy no vain noise affrighted; lofty-necked,\r\nWith clean-cut head, short belly, and stout back;\r\nHis sprightly breast exuberant with brawn.\r\nChestnut and grey are good; the worst-hued white\r\nAnd sorrel. Then lo! if arms are clashed afar,\r\nBide still he cannot: ears stiffen and limbs quake;\r\nHis nostrils snort and roll out wreaths of fire.\r\nDense is his mane, that when uplifted falls\r\nOn his right shoulder; betwixt either loin\r\nThe spine runs double; his earth-dinting hoof\r\nRings with the ponderous beat of solid horn.\r\nEven such a horse was Cyllarus, reined and tamed\r\nBy Pollux of Amyclae; such the pair\r\nIn Grecian song renowned, those steeds of Mars,\r\nAnd famed Achilles' team: in such-like form\r\nGreat Saturn's self with mane flung loose on neck\r\nSped at his wife's approach, and flying filled\r\nThe heights of Pelion with his piercing neigh.\r\n  Even him, when sore disease or sluggish eld\r\nNow saps his strength, pen fast at home, and spare\r\nHis not inglorious age. A horse grown old\r\nSlow kindling unto love in vain prolongs\r\nThe fruitless task, and, to the encounter come,\r\nAs fire in stubble blusters without strength,\r\nHe rages idly. Therefore mark thou first\r\nTheir age and mettle, other points anon,\r\nAs breed and lineage, or what pain was theirs\r\nTo lose the race, what pride the palm to win.\r\nSeest how the chariots in mad rivalry\r\nPoured from the barrier grip the course and go,\r\nWhen youthful hope is highest, and every heart\r\nDrained with each wild pulsation? How they ply\r\nThe circling lash, and reaching forward let\r\nThe reins hang free! Swift spins the glowing wheel;\r\nAnd now they stoop, and now erect in air\r\nSeem borne through space and towering to the sky:\r\nNo stop, no stay; the dun sand whirls aloft;\r\nThey reek with foam-flakes and pursuing breath;\r\nSo sweet is fame, so prized the victor's palm.\r\n'Twas Ericthonius first took heart to yoke\r\nFour horses to his car, and rode above\r\nThe whirling wheels to victory: but the ring\r\nAnd bridle-reins, mounted on horses' backs,\r\nThe Pelethronian Lapithae bequeathed,\r\nAnd taught the knight in arms to spurn the ground,\r\nAnd arch the upgathered footsteps of his pride.\r\nEach task alike is arduous, and for each\r\nA horse young, fiery, swift of foot, they seek;\r\nHow oft so-e'er yon rival may have chased\r\nThe flying foe, or boast his native plain\r\nEpirus, or Mycenae's stubborn hold,\r\nAnd trace his lineage back to Neptune's birth.\r\n  These points regarded, as the time draws nigh,\r\nWith instant zeal they lavish all their care\r\nTo plump with solid fat the chosen chief\r\nAnd designated husband of the herd:\r\nAnd flowery herbs they cut, and serve him well\r\nWith corn and running water, that his strength\r\nNot fail him for that labour of delight,\r\nNor puny colts betray the feeble sire.\r\nThe herd itself of purpose they reduce\r\nTo leanness, and when love's sweet longing first\r\nProvokes them, they forbid the leafy food,\r\nAnd pen them from the springs, and oft beside\r\nWith running shake, and tire them in the sun,\r\nWhat time the threshing-floor groans heavily\r\nWith pounding of the corn-ears, and light chaff\r\nIs whirled on high to catch the rising west.\r\nThis do they that the soil's prolific powers\r\nMay not be dulled by surfeiting, nor choke\r\nThe sluggish furrows, but eagerly absorb\r\nTheir fill of love, and deeply entertain.\r\n  To care of sire the mother's care succeeds.\r\nWhen great with young they wander nigh their time,\r\nLet no man suffer them to drag the yoke\r\nIn heavy wains, nor leap across the way,\r\nNor scour the meads, nor swim the rushing flood.\r\nIn lonely lawns they feed them, by the course\r\nOf brimming streams, where moss is, and the banks\r\nWith grass are greenest, where are sheltering caves,\r\nAnd far outstretched the rock-flung shadow lies.\r\nRound wooded Silarus and the ilex-bowers\r\nOf green Alburnus swarms a winged pest-\r\nIts Roman name Asilus, by the Greeks\r\nTermed Oestros- fierce it is, and harshly hums,\r\nDriving whole herds in terror through the groves,\r\nTill heaven is madded by their bellowing din,\r\nAnd Tanager's dry bed and forest-banks.\r\nWith this same scourge did Juno wreak of old\r\nThe terrors of her wrath, a plague devised\r\nAgainst the heifer sprung from Inachus.\r\nFrom this too thou, since in the noontide heats\r\n'Tis most persistent, fend thy teeming herds,\r\nAnd feed them when the sun is newly risen,\r\nOr the first stars are ushering in the night.\r\n  But, yeaning ended, all their tender care\r\nIs to the calves transferred; at once with marks\r\nThey brand them, both to designate their race,\r\nAnd which to rear for breeding, or devote\r\nAs altar-victims, or to cleave the ground\r\nAnd into ridges tear and turn the sod.\r\nThe rest along the greensward graze at will.\r\nThose that to rustic uses thou wouldst mould,\r\nAs calves encourage and take steps to tame,\r\nWhile pliant wills and plastic youth allow.\r\nAnd first of slender withies round the throat\r\nLoose collars hang, then when their free-born necks\r\nAre used to service, with the self-same bands\r\nYoke them in pairs, and steer by steer compel\r\nKeep pace together. And time it is that oft\r\nUnfreighted wheels be drawn along the ground\r\nBehind them, as to dint the surface-dust;\r\nThen let the beechen axle strain and creak\r\n'Neath some stout burden, whilst a brazen pole\r\nDrags on the wheels made fast thereto. Meanwhile\r\nFor their unbroken youth not grass alone,\r\nNor meagre willow-leaves and marish-sedge,\r\nBut corn-ears with thy hand pluck from the crops.\r\nNor shall the brood-kine, as of yore, for thee\r\nBrim high the snowy milking-pail, but spend\r\nTheir udders' fullness on their own sweet young.\r\n  But if fierce squadrons and the ranks of war\r\nDelight thee rather, or on wheels to glide\r\nAt Pisa, with Alpheus fleeting by,\r\nAnd in the grove of Jupiter urge on\r\nThe flying chariot, be your steed's first task\r\nTo face the warrior's armed rage, and brook\r\nThe trumpet, and long roar of rumbling wheels,\r\nAnd clink of chiming bridles in the stall;\r\nThen more and more to love his master's voice\r\nCaressing, or loud hand that claps his neck.\r\nAy, thus far let him learn to dare, when first\r\nWeaned from his mother, and his mouth at times\r\nYield to the supple halter, even while yet\r\nWeak, tottering-limbed, and ignorant of life.\r\nBut, three years ended, when the fourth arrives,\r\nNow let him tarry not to run the ring\r\nWith rhythmic hoof-beat echoing, and now learn\r\nAlternately to curve each bending leg,\r\nAnd be like one that struggleth; then at last\r\nChallenge the winds to race him, and at speed\r\nLaunched through the open, like a reinless thing,\r\nScarce print his footsteps on the surface-sand.\r\nAs when with power from Hyperborean climes\r\nThe north wind stoops, and scatters from his path\r\nDry clouds and storms of Scythia; the tall corn\r\nAnd rippling plains 'gin shiver with light gusts;\r\nA sound is heard among the forest-tops;\r\nLong waves come racing shoreward: fast he flies,\r\nWith instant pinion sweeping earth and main.\r\n  A steed like this or on the mighty course\r\nOf Elis at the goal will sweat, and shower\r\nRed foam-flakes from his mouth, or, kindlier task,\r\nWith patient neck support the Belgian car.\r\nThen, broken at last, let swell their burly frame\r\nWith fattening corn-mash, for, unbroke, they will\r\nWith pride wax wanton, and, when caught, refuse\r\nTough lash to brook or jagged curb obey.\r\n  But no device so fortifies their power\r\nAs love's blind stings of passion to forefend,\r\nWhether on steed or steer thy choice be set.\r\nAy, therefore 'tis they banish bulls afar\r\nTo solitary pastures, or behind\r\nSome mountain-barrier, or broad streams beyond,\r\nOr else in plenteous stalls pen fast at home.\r\nFor, even through sight of her, the female wastes\r\nHis strength with smouldering fire, till he forget\r\nBoth grass and woodland. She indeed full oft\r\nWith her sweet charms can lovers proud compel\r\nTo battle for the conquest horn to horn.\r\nIn Sila's forest feeds the heifer fair,\r\nWhile each on each the furious rivals run;\r\nWound follows wound; the black blood laves their limbs;\r\nHorns push and strive against opposing horns,\r\nWith mighty groaning; all the forest-side\r\nAnd far Olympus bellow back the roar.\r\nNor wont the champions in one stall to couch;\r\nBut he that's worsted hies him to strange climes\r\nFar off, an exile, moaning much the shame,\r\nThe blows of that proud conqueror, then love's loss\r\nAvenged not; with one glance toward the byre,\r\nHis ancient royalties behind him lie.\r\nSo with all heed his strength he practiseth,\r\nAnd nightlong makes the hard bare stones his bed,\r\nAnd feeds on prickly leaf and pointed rush,\r\nAnd proves himself, and butting at a tree\r\nLearns to fling wrath into his horns, with blows\r\nProvokes the air, and scattering clouds of sand\r\nMakes prelude of the battle; afterward,\r\nWith strength repaired and gathered might breaks camp,\r\nAnd hurls him headlong on the unthinking foe:\r\nAs in mid ocean when a wave far of\r\nBegins to whiten, mustering from the main\r\nIts rounded breast, and, onward rolled to land\r\nFalls with prodigious roar among the rocks,\r\nHuge as a very mountain: but the depths\r\nUpseethe in swirling eddies, and disgorge\r\nThe murky sand-lees from their sunken bed.\r\n  Nay, every race on earth of men, and beasts,\r\nAnd ocean-folk, and flocks, and painted birds,\r\nRush to the raging fire: love sways them all.\r\nNever than then more fiercely o'er the plain\r\nProwls heedless of her whelps the lioness:\r\nNor monstrous bears such wide-spread havoc-doom\r\nDeal through the forests; then the boar is fierce,\r\nMost deadly then the tigress: then, alack!\r\nIll roaming is it on Libya's lonely plains.\r\nMark you what shivering thrills the horse's frame,\r\nIf but a waft the well-known gust conveys?\r\nNor curb can check them then, nor lash severe,\r\nNor rocks and caverned crags, nor barrier-floods,\r\nThat rend and whirl and wash the hills away.\r\nThen speeds amain the great Sabellian boar,\r\nHis tushes whets, with forefoot tears the ground,\r\nRubs 'gainst a tree his flanks, and to and fro\r\nHardens each wallowing shoulder to the wound.\r\nWhat of the youth, when love's relentless might\r\nStirs the fierce fire within his veins? Behold!\r\nIn blindest midnight how he swims the gulf\r\nConvulsed with bursting storm-clouds! Over him\r\nHeaven's huge gate thunders; the rock-shattered main\r\nUtters a warning cry; nor parents' tears\r\nCan backward call him, nor the maid he loves,\r\nToo soon to die on his untimely pyre.\r\nWhat of the spotted ounce to Bacchus dear,\r\nOr warlike wolf-kin or the breed of dogs?\r\nWhy tell how timorous stags the battle join?\r\nO'er all conspicuous is the rage of mares,\r\nBy Venus' self inspired of old, what time\r\nThe Potnian four with rending jaws devoured\r\nThe limbs of Glaucus. Love-constrained they roam\r\nPast Gargarus, past the loud Ascanian flood;\r\nThey climb the mountains, and the torrents swim;\r\nAnd when their eager marrow first conceives\r\nThe fire, in Spring-tide chiefly, for with Spring\r\nWarmth doth their frames revisit, then they stand\r\nAll facing westward on the rocky heights,\r\nAnd of the gentle breezes take their fill;\r\nAnd oft unmated, marvellous to tell,\r\nBut of the wind impregnate, far and wide\r\nO'er craggy height and lowly vale they scud,\r\nNot toward thy rising, Eurus, or the sun's,\r\nBut westward and north-west, or whence up-springs\r\nBlack Auster, that glooms heaven with rainy cold.\r\nHence from their groin slow drips a poisonous juice,\r\nBy shepherds truly named hippomanes,\r\nHippomanes, fell stepdames oft have culled,\r\nAnd mixed with herbs and spells of baneful bode.\r\n  Fast flies meanwhile the irreparable hour,\r\nAs point to point our charmed round we trace.\r\nEnough of herds. This second task remains,\r\nThe wool-clad flocks and shaggy goats to treat.\r\nHere lies a labour; hence for glory look,\r\nBrave husbandmen. Nor doubtfully know\r\nHow hard it is for words to triumph here,\r\nAnd shed their lustre on a theme so slight:\r\nBut I am caught by ravishing desire\r\nAbove the lone Parnassian steep; I love\r\nTo walk the heights, from whence no earlier track\r\nSlopes gently downward to Castalia's spring.\r\n  Now, awful Pales, strike a louder tone.\r\nFirst, for the sheep soft pencotes I decree\r\nTo browse in, till green summer's swift return;\r\nAnd that the hard earth under them with straw\r\nAnd handfuls of the fern be littered deep,\r\nLest chill of ice such tender cattle harm\r\nWith scab and loathly foot-rot. Passing thence\r\nI bid the goats with arbute-leaves be stored,\r\nAnd served with fresh spring-water, and their pens\r\nTurned southward from the blast, to face the suns\r\nOf winter, when Aquarius' icy beam\r\nNow sinks in showers upon the parting year.\r\nThese too no lightlier our protection claim,\r\nNor prove of poorer service, howsoe'er\r\nMilesian fleeces dipped in Tyrian reds\r\nRepay the barterer; these with offspring teem\r\nMore numerous; these yield plenteous store of milk:\r\nThe more each dry-wrung udder froths the pail,\r\nMore copious soon the teat-pressed torrents flow.\r\nAy, and on Cinyps' bank the he-goats too\r\nTheir beards and grizzled chins and bristling hair\r\nLet clip for camp-use, or as rugs to wrap\r\nSeafaring wretches. But they browse the woods\r\nAnd summits of Lycaeus, and rough briers,\r\nAnd brakes that love the highland: of themselves\r\nRight heedfully the she-goats homeward troop\r\nBefore their kids, and with plump udders clogged\r\nScarce cross the threshold. Wherefore rather ye,\r\nThe less they crave man's vigilance, be fain\r\nFrom ice to fend them and from snowy winds;\r\nBring food and feast them with their branchy fare,\r\nNor lock your hay-loft all the winter long.\r\n  But when glad summer at the west wind's call\r\nSends either flock to pasture in the glades,\r\nSoon as the day-star shineth, hie we then\r\nTo the cool meadows, while the dawn is young,\r\nThe grass yet hoary, and to browsing herds\r\nThe dew tastes sweetest on the tender sward.\r\nWhen heaven's fourth hour draws on the thickening drought,\r\nAnd shrill cicalas pierce the brake with song,\r\nThen at the well-springs bid them, or deep pools,\r\nFrom troughs of holm-oak quaff the running wave:\r\nBut at day's hottest seek a shadowy vale,\r\nWhere some vast ancient-timbered oak of Jove\r\nSpreads his huge branches, or where huddling black\r\nIlex on ilex cowers in awful shade.\r\nThen once more give them water sparingly,\r\nAnd feed once more, till sunset, when cool eve\r\nAllays the air, and dewy moonbeams slake\r\nThe forest glades, with halcyon's song the shore,\r\nAnd every thicket with the goldfinch rings.\r\n  Of Libya's shepherds why the tale pursue?\r\nWhy sing their pastures and the scattered huts\r\nThey house in? Oft their cattle day and night\r\nGraze the whole month together, and go forth\r\nInto far deserts where no shelter is,\r\nSo flat the plain and boundless. All his goods\r\nThe Afric swain bears with him, house and home,\r\nArms, Cretan quiver, and Amyclaean dog;\r\nAs some keen Roman in his country's arms\r\nPlies the swift march beneath a cruel load;\r\nSoon with tents pitched and at his post he stands,\r\nEre looked for by the foe. Not thus the tribes\r\nOf Scythia by the far Maeotic wave,\r\nWhere turbid Ister whirls his yellow sands,\r\nAnd Rhodope stretched out beneath the pole\r\nComes trending backward. There the herds they keep\r\nClose-pent in byres, nor any grass is seen\r\nUpon the plain, nor leaves upon the tree:\r\nBut with snow-ridges and deep frost afar\r\nHeaped seven ells high the earth lies featureless:\r\nStill winter? still the north wind's icy breath!\r\nNay, never sun disparts the shadows pale,\r\nOr as he rides the steep of heaven, or dips\r\nIn ocean's fiery bath his plunging car.\r\nQuick ice-crusts curdle on the running stream,\r\nAnd iron-hooped wheels the water's back now bears,\r\nTo broad wains opened, as erewhile to ships;\r\nBrass vessels oft asunder burst, and clothes\r\nStiffen upon the wearers; juicy wines\r\nThey cleave with axes; to one frozen mass\r\nWhole pools are turned; and on their untrimmed beards\r\nStiff clings the jagged icicle. Meanwhile\r\nAll heaven no less is filled with falling snow;\r\nThe cattle perish: oxen's mighty frames\r\nStand island-like amid the frost, and stags\r\nIn huddling herds, by that strange weight benumbed,\r\nScarce top the surface with their antler-points.\r\nThese with no hounds they hunt, nor net with toils,\r\nNor scare with terror of the crimson plume;\r\nBut, as in vain they breast the opposing block,\r\nButcher them, knife in hand, and so dispatch\r\nLoud-bellowing, and with glad shouts hale them home.\r\nThemselves in deep-dug caverns underground\r\nDwell free and careless; to their hearths they heave\r\nOak-logs and elm-trees whole, and fire them there,\r\nThere play the night out, and in festive glee\r\nWith barm and service sour the wine-cup mock.\r\nSo 'neath the seven-starred Hyperborean wain\r\nThe folk live tameless, buffeted with blasts\r\nOf Eurus from Rhipaean hills, and wrap\r\nTheir bodies in the tawny fells of beasts.\r\n  If wool delight thee, first, be far removed\r\nAll prickly boskage, burrs and caltrops; shun\r\nLuxuriant pastures; at the outset choose\r\nWhite flocks with downy fleeces. For the ram,\r\nHow white soe'er himself, be but the tongue\r\n'Neath his moist palate black, reject him, lest\r\nHe sully with dark spots his offspring's fleece,\r\nAnd seek some other o'er the teeming plain.\r\nEven with such snowy bribe of wool, if ear\r\nMay trust the tale, Pan, God of Arcady,\r\nSnared and beguiled thee, Luna, calling thee\r\nTo the deep woods; nor thou didst spurn his call.\r\n  But who for milk hath longing, must himself\r\nCarry lucerne and lotus-leaves enow\r\nWith salt herbs to the cote, whence more they love\r\nThe streams, more stretch their udders, and give back\r\nA subtle taste of saltness in the milk.\r\nMany there be who from their mothers keep\r\nThe new-born kids, and straightway bind their mouths\r\nWith iron-tipped muzzles. What they milk at dawn,\r\nOr in the daylight hours, at night they press;\r\nWhat darkling or at sunset, this ere morn\r\nThey bear away in baskets- for to town\r\nThe shepherd hies him- or with dash of salt\r\nJust sprinkle, and lay by for winter use.\r\n  Nor be thy dogs last cared for; but alike\r\nSwift Spartan hounds and fierce Molossian feed\r\nOn fattening whey. Never, with these to watch,\r\nDread nightly thief afold and ravening wolves,\r\nOr Spanish desperadoes in the rear.\r\nAnd oft the shy wild asses thou wilt chase,\r\nWith hounds, too, hunt the hare, with hounds the doe;\r\nOft from his woodland wallowing-den uprouse\r\nThe boar, and scare him with their baying, and drive,\r\nAnd o'er the mountains urge into the toils\r\nSome antlered monster to their chiming cry.\r\n  Learn also scented cedar-wood to burn\r\nWithin the stalls, and snakes of noxious smell\r\nWith fumes of galbanum to drive away.\r\nOft under long-neglected cribs, or lurks\r\nA viper ill to handle, that hath fled\r\nThe light in terror, or some snake, that wont\r\n'Neath shade and sheltering roof to creep, and shower\r\nIts bane among the cattle, hugs the ground,\r\nFell scourge of kine. Shepherd, seize stakes, seize stones!\r\nAnd as he rears defiance, and puffs out\r\nA hissing throat, down with him! see how low\r\nThat cowering crest is vailed in flight, the while,\r\nHis midmost coils and final sweep of tail\r\nRelaxing, the last fold drags lingering spires.\r\nThen that vile worm that in Calabrian glades\r\nUprears his breast, and wreathes a scaly back,\r\nHis length of belly pied with mighty spots-\r\nWhile from their founts gush any streams, while yet\r\nWith showers of Spring and rainy south-winds earth\r\nIs moistened, lo! he haunts the pools, and here\r\nHoused in the banks, with fish and chattering frogs\r\nCrams the black void of his insatiate maw.\r\nSoon as the fens are parched, and earth with heat\r\nIs gaping, forth he darts into the dry,\r\nRolls eyes of fire and rages through the fields,\r\nFurious from thirst and by the drought dismayed.\r\nMe list not then beneath the open heaven\r\nTo snatch soft slumber, nor on forest-ridge\r\nLie stretched along the grass, when, slipped his slough,\r\nTo glittering youth transformed he winds his spires,\r\nAnd eggs or younglings leaving in his lair,\r\nTowers sunward, lightening with three-forked tongue.\r\n  Of sickness, too, the causes and the signs\r\nI'll teach thee. Loathly scab assails the sheep,\r\nWhen chilly showers have probed them to the quick,\r\nAnd winter stark with hoar-frost, or when sweat\r\nUnpurged cleaves to them after shearing done,\r\nAnd rough thorns rend their bodies. Hence it is\r\nShepherds their whole flock steep in running streams,\r\nWhile, plunged beneath the flood, with drenched fell,\r\nThe ram, launched free, goes drifting down the tide.\r\nElse, having shorn, they smear their bodies o'er\r\nWith acrid oil-lees, and mix silver-scum\r\nAnd native sulphur and Idaean pitch,\r\nWax mollified with ointment, and therewith\r\nSea-leek, strong hellebores, bitumen black.\r\nYet ne'er doth kindlier fortune crown his toil,\r\nThan if with blade of iron a man dare lance\r\nThe ulcer's mouth ope: for the taint is fed\r\nAnd quickened by confinement; while the swain\r\nHis hand of healing from the wound withholds,\r\nOr sits for happier signs imploring heaven.\r\nAye, and when inward to the bleater's bones\r\nThe pain hath sunk and rages, and their limbs\r\nBy thirsty fever are consumed, 'tis good\r\nTo draw the enkindled heat therefrom, and pierce\r\nWithin the hoof-clefts a blood-bounding vein.\r\nOf tribes Bisaltic such the wonted use,\r\nAnd keen Gelonian, when to Rhodope\r\nHe flies, or Getic desert, and quaffs milk\r\nWith horse-blood curdled.\r\n                       Seest one far afield\r\nOft to the shade's mild covert win, or pull\r\nThe grass tops listlessly, or hindmost lag,\r\nOr, browsing, cast her down amid the plain,\r\nAt night retire belated and alone;\r\nWith quick knife check the mischief, ere it creep\r\nWith dire contagion through the unwary herd.\r\nLess thick and fast the whirlwind scours the main\r\nWith tempest in its wake, than swarm the plagues\r\nOf cattle; nor seize they single lives alone,\r\nBut sudden clear whole feeding grounds, the flock\r\nWith all its promise, and extirpate the breed.\r\nWell would he trow it who, so long after, still\r\nHigh Alps and Noric hill-forts should behold,\r\nAnd Iapydian Timavus' fields,\r\nAy, still behold the shepherds' realms a waste,\r\nAnd far and wide the lawns untenanted.\r\n  Here from distempered heavens erewhile arose\r\nA piteous season, with the full fierce heat\r\nOf autumn glowed, and cattle-kindreds all\r\nAnd all wild creatures to destruction gave,\r\nTainted the pools, the fodder charged with bane.\r\nNor simple was the way of death, but when\r\nHot thirst through every vein impelled had drawn\r\nTheir wretched limbs together, anon o'erflowed\r\nA watery flux, and all their bones piecemeal\r\nSapped by corruption to itself absorbed.\r\nOft in mid sacrifice to heaven- the white\r\nWool-woven fillet half wreathed about his brow-\r\nSome victim, standing by the altar, there\r\nBetwixt the loitering carles a-dying fell:\r\nOr, if betimes the slaughtering priest had struck,\r\nNor with its heaped entrails blazed the pile,\r\nNor seer to seeker thence could answer yield;\r\nNay, scarce the up-stabbing knife with blood was stained,\r\nScarce sullied with thin gore the surface-sand.\r\nHence die the calves in many a pasture fair,\r\nOr at full cribs their lives' sweet breath resign;\r\nHence on the fawning dog comes madness, hence\r\nRacks the sick swine a gasping cough that chokes\r\nWith swelling at the jaws: the conquering steed,\r\nUncrowned of effort and heedless of the sward,\r\nFaints, turns him from the springs, and paws the earth\r\nWith ceaseless hoof: low droop his ears, wherefrom\r\nBursts fitful sweat, a sweat that waxes cold\r\nUpon the dying beast; the skin is dry,\r\nAnd rigidly repels the handler's touch.\r\nThese earlier signs they give that presage doom.\r\nBut, if the advancing plague 'gin fiercer grow,\r\nThen are their eyes all fire, deep-drawn their breath,\r\nAt times groan-laboured: with long sobbing heave\r\nTheir lowest flanks; from either nostril streams\r\nBlack blood; a rough tongue clogs the obstructed jaws.\r\n'Twas helpful through inverted horn to pour\r\nDraughts of the wine-god down; sole way it seemed\r\nTo save the dying: soon this too proved their bane,\r\nAnd, reinvigorate but with frenzy's fire,\r\nEven at death's pinch- the gods some happier fate\r\nDeal to the just, such madness to their foes-\r\nEach with bared teeth his own limbs mangling tore.\r\nSee! as he smokes beneath the stubborn share,\r\nThe bull drops, vomiting foam-dabbled gore,\r\nAnd heaves his latest groans. Sad goes the swain,\r\nUnhooks the steer that mourns his fellow's fate,\r\nAnd in mid labour leaves the plough-gear fast.\r\nNor tall wood's shadow, nor soft sward may stir\r\nThat heart's emotion, nor rock-channelled flood,\r\nMore pure than amber speeding to the plain:\r\nBut see! his flanks fail under him, his eyes\r\nAre dulled with deadly torpor, and his neck\r\nSinks to the earth with drooping weight. What now\r\nBesteads him toil or service? to have turned\r\nThe heavy sod with ploughshare? And yet these\r\nNe'er knew the Massic wine-god's baneful boon,\r\nNor twice replenished banquets: but on leaves\r\nThey fare, and virgin grasses, and their cups\r\nAre crystal springs and streams with running tired,\r\nTheir healthful slumbers never broke by care.\r\nThen only, say they, through that country side\r\nFor Juno's rites were cattle far to seek,\r\nAnd ill-matched buffaloes the chariots drew\r\nTo their high fanes. So, painfully with rakes\r\nThey grub the soil, aye, with their very nails\r\nDig in the corn-seeds, and with strained neck\r\nO'er the high uplands drag the creaking wains.\r\nNo wolf for ambush pries about the pen,\r\nNor round the flock prowls nightly; pain more sharp\r\nSubdues him: the shy deer and fleet-foot stags\r\nWith hounds now wander by the haunts of men\r\nVast ocean's offspring, and all tribes that swim,\r\nOn the shore's confine the wave washes up,\r\nLike shipwrecked bodies: seals, unwonted there,\r\nFlee to the rivers. Now the viper dies,\r\nFor all his den's close winding, and with scales\r\nErect the astonied water-worms. The air\r\nBrooks not the very birds, that headlong fall,\r\nAnd leave their life beneath the soaring cloud.\r\nMoreover now nor change of fodder serves,\r\nAnd subtlest cures but injure; then were foiled\r\nThe masters, Chiron sprung from Phillyron,\r\nAnd Amythaon's son Melampus. See!\r\nFrom Stygian darkness launched into the light\r\nComes raging pale Tisiphone; she drives\r\nDisease and fear before her, day by day\r\nStill rearing higher that all-devouring head.\r\nWith bleat of flocks and lowings thick resound\r\nRivers and parched banks and sloping heights.\r\nAt last in crowds she slaughters them, she chokes\r\nThe very stalls with carrion-heaps that rot\r\nIn hideous corruption, till men learn\r\nWith earth to cover them, in pits to hide.\r\nFor e'en the fells are useless; nor the flesh\r\nWith water may they purge, or tame with fire,\r\nNor shear the fleeces even, gnawed through and through\r\nWith foul disease, nor touch the putrid webs;\r\nBut, had one dared the loathly weeds to try,\r\nRed blisters and an unclean sweat o'erran\r\nHis noisome limbs, till, no long tarriance made,\r\nThe fiery curse his tainted frame devoured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGIC IV\r\n\r\nOf air-born honey, gift of heaven, I now\r\nTake up the tale. Upon this theme no less\r\nLook thou, Maecenas, with indulgent eye.\r\nA marvellous display of puny powers,\r\nHigh-hearted chiefs, a nation's history,\r\nIts traits, its bent, its battles and its clans,\r\nAll, each, shall pass before you, while I sing.\r\nSlight though the poet's theme, not slight the praise,\r\nSo frown not heaven, and Phoebus hear his call.\r\n  First find your bees a settled sure abode,\r\nWhere neither winds can enter (winds blow back\r\nThe foragers with food returning home)\r\nNor sheep and butting kids tread down the flowers,\r\nNor heifer wandering wide upon the plain\r\nDash off the dew, and bruise the springing blades.\r\nLet the gay lizard too keep far aloof\r\nHis scale-clad body from their honied stalls,\r\nAnd the bee-eater, and what birds beside,\r\nAnd Procne smirched with blood upon the breast\r\nFrom her own murderous hands. For these roam wide\r\nWasting all substance, or the bees themselves\r\nStrike flying, and in their beaks bear home, to glut\r\nThose savage nestlings with the dainty prey.\r\nBut let clear springs and moss-green pools be near,\r\nAnd through the grass a streamlet hurrying run,\r\nSome palm-tree o'er the porch extend its shade,\r\nOr huge-grown oleaster, that in Spring,\r\nTheir own sweet Spring-tide, when the new-made chiefs\r\nLead forth the young swarms, and, escaped their comb,\r\nThe colony comes forth to sport and play,\r\nThe neighbouring bank may lure them from the heat,\r\nOr bough befriend with hospitable shade.\r\nO'er the mid-waters, whether swift or still,\r\nCast willow-branches and big stones enow,\r\nBridge after bridge, where they may footing find\r\nAnd spread their wide wings to the summer sun,\r\nIf haply Eurus, swooping as they pause,\r\nHave dashed with spray or plunged them in the deep.\r\nAnd let green cassias and far-scented thymes,\r\nAnd savory with its heavy-laden breath\r\nBloom round about, and violet-beds hard by\r\nSip sweetness from the fertilizing springs.\r\nFor the hive's self, or stitched of hollow bark,\r\nOr from tough osier woven, let the doors\r\nBe strait of entrance; for stiff winter's cold\r\nCongeals the honey, and heat resolves and thaws,\r\nTo bees alike disastrous; not for naught\r\nSo haste they to cement the tiny pores\r\nThat pierce their walls, and fill the crevices\r\nWith pollen from the flowers, and glean and keep\r\nTo this same end the glue, that binds more fast\r\nThan bird-lime or the pitch from Ida's pines.\r\nOft too in burrowed holes, if fame be true,\r\nThey make their cosy subterranean home,\r\nAnd deeply lodged in hollow rocks are found,\r\nOr in the cavern of an age-hewn tree.\r\nThou not the less smear round their crannied cribs\r\nWith warm smooth mud-coat, and strew leaves above;\r\nBut near their home let neither yew-tree grow,\r\nNor reddening crabs be roasted, and mistrust\r\nDeep marish-ground and mire with noisome smell,\r\nOr where the hollow rocks sonorous ring,\r\nAnd the word spoken buffets and rebounds.\r\n  What more? When now the golden sun has put\r\nWinter to headlong flight beneath the world,\r\nAnd oped the doors of heaven with summer ray,\r\nForthwith they roam the glades and forests o'er,\r\nRifle the painted flowers, or sip the streams,\r\nLight-hovering on the surface. Hence it is\r\nWith some sweet rapture, that we know not of,\r\nTheir little ones they foster, hence with skill\r\nWork out new wax or clinging honey mould.\r\nSo when the cage-escaped hosts you see\r\nFloat heavenward through the hot clear air, until\r\nYou marvel at yon dusky cloud that spreads\r\nAnd lengthens on the wind, then mark them well;\r\nFor then 'tis ever the fresh springs they seek\r\nAnd bowery shelter: hither must you bring\r\nThe savoury sweets I bid, and sprinkle them,\r\nBruised balsam and the wax-flower's lowly weed,\r\nAnd wake and shake the tinkling cymbals heard\r\nBy the great Mother: on the anointed spots\r\nThemselves will settle, and in wonted wise\r\nSeek of themselves the cradle's inmost depth.\r\n  But if to battle they have hied them forth-\r\nFor oft 'twixt king and king with uproar dire\r\nFierce feud arises, and at once from far\r\nYou may discern what passion sways the mob,\r\nAnd how their hearts are throbbing for the strife;\r\nHark! the hoarse brazen note that warriors know\r\nChides on the loiterers, and the ear may catch\r\nA sound that mocks the war-trump's broken blasts;\r\nThen in hot haste they muster, then flash wings,\r\nSharpen their pointed beaks and knit their thews,\r\nAnd round the king, even to his royal tent,\r\nThrong rallying, and with shouts defy the foe.\r\nSo, when a dry Spring and clear space is given,\r\nForth from the gates they burst, they clash on high;\r\nA din arises; they are heaped and rolled\r\nInto one mighty mass, and headlong fall,\r\nNot denselier hail through heaven, nor pelting so\r\nRains from the shaken oak its acorn-shower.\r\nConspicuous by their wings the chiefs themselves\r\nPress through the heart of battle, and display\r\nA giant's spirit in each pigmy frame,\r\nSteadfast no inch to yield till these or those\r\nThe victor's ponderous arm has turned to flight.\r\nSuch fiery passions and such fierce assaults\r\nA little sprinkled dust controls and quells.\r\nAnd now, both leaders from the field recalled,\r\nWho hath the worser seeming, do to death,\r\nLest royal waste wax burdensome, but let\r\nHis better lord it on the empty throne.\r\nOne with gold-burnished flakes will shine like fire,\r\nFor twofold are their kinds, the nobler he,\r\nOf peerless front and lit with flashing scales;\r\nThat other, from neglect and squalor foul,\r\nDrags slow a cumbrous belly. As with kings,\r\nSo too with people, diverse is their mould,\r\nSome rough and loathly, as when the wayfarer\r\nScapes from a whirl of dust, and scorched with heat\r\nSpits forth the dry grit from his parched mouth:\r\nThe others shine forth and flash with lightning-gleam,\r\nTheir backs all blazoned with bright drops of gold\r\nSymmetric: this the likelier breed; from these,\r\nWhen heaven brings round the season, thou shalt strain\r\nSweet honey, nor yet so sweet as passing clear,\r\nAnd mellowing on the tongue the wine-god's fire.\r\n  But when the swarms fly aimlessly abroad,\r\nDisport themselves in heaven and spurn their cells,\r\nLeaving the hive unwarmed, from such vain play\r\nMust you refrain their volatile desires,\r\nNor hard the task: tear off the monarchs' wings;\r\nWhile these prove loiterers, none beside will dare\r\nMount heaven, or pluck the standards from the camp.\r\nLet gardens with the breath of saffron flowers\r\nAllure them, and the lord of Hellespont,\r\nPriapus, wielder of the willow-scythe,\r\nSafe in his keeping hold from birds and thieves.\r\nAnd let the man to whom such cares are dear\r\nHimself bring thyme and pine-trees from the heights,\r\nAnd strew them in broad belts about their home;\r\nNo hand but his the blistering task should ply,\r\nPlant the young slips, or shed the genial showers.\r\n  And I myself, were I not even now\r\nFurling my sails, and, nigh the journey's end,\r\nEager to turn my vessel's prow to shore,\r\nPerchance would sing what careful husbandry\r\nMakes the trim garden smile; of Paestum too,\r\nWhose roses bloom and fade and bloom again;\r\nHow endives glory in the streams they drink,\r\nAnd green banks in their parsley, and how the gourd\r\nTwists through the grass and rounds him to paunch;\r\nNor of Narcissus had my lips been dumb,\r\nThat loiterer of the flowers, nor supple-stemmed\r\nAcanthus, with the praise of ivies pale,\r\nAnd myrtles clinging to the shores they love.\r\nFor 'neath the shade of tall Oebalia's towers,\r\nWhere dark Galaesus laves the yellowing fields,\r\nAn old man once I mind me to have seen-\r\nFrom Corycus he came- to whom had fallen\r\nSome few poor acres of neglected land,\r\nAnd they nor fruitful' neath the plodding steer,\r\nMeet for the grazing herd, nor good for vines.\r\nYet he, the while his meagre garden-herbs\r\nAmong the thorns he planted, and all round\r\nWhite lilies, vervains, and lean poppy set,\r\nIn pride of spirit matched the wealth of kings,\r\nAnd home returning not till night was late,\r\nWith unbought plenty heaped his board on high.\r\nHe was the first to cull the rose in spring,\r\nHe the ripe fruits in autumn; and ere yet\r\nWinter had ceased in sullen ire to rive\r\nThe rocks with frost, and with her icy bit\r\nCurb in the running waters, there was he\r\nPlucking the rathe faint hyacinth, while he chid\r\nSummer's slow footsteps and the lagging West.\r\nTherefore he too with earliest brooding bees\r\nAnd their full swarms o'erflowed, and first was he\r\nTo press the bubbling honey from the comb;\r\nLime-trees were his, and many a branching pine;\r\nAnd all the fruits wherewith in early bloom\r\nThe orchard-tree had clothed her, in full tale\r\nHung there, by mellowing autumn perfected.\r\nHe too transplanted tall-grown elms a-row,\r\nTime-toughened pear, thorns bursting with the plum\r\nAnd plane now yielding serviceable shade\r\nFor dry lips to drink under: but these things,\r\nShut off by rigorous limits, I pass by,\r\nAnd leave for others to sing after me.\r\n  Come, then, I will unfold the natural powers\r\nGreat Jove himself upon the bees bestowed,\r\nThe boon for which, led by the shrill sweet strains\r\nOf the Curetes and their clashing brass,\r\nThey fed the King of heaven in Dicte's cave.\r\nAlone of all things they receive and hold\r\nCommunity of offspring, and they house\r\nTogether in one city, and beneath\r\nThe shelter of majestic laws they live;\r\nAnd they alone fixed home and country know,\r\nAnd in the summer, warned of coming cold,\r\nMake proof of toil, and for the general store\r\nHoard up their gathered harvesting. For some\r\nWatch o'er the victualling of the hive, and these\r\nBy settled order ply their tasks afield;\r\nAnd some within the confines of their home\r\nPlant firm the comb's first layer, Narcissus' tear,\r\nAnd sticky gum oozed from the bark of trees,\r\nThen set the clinging wax to hang therefrom.\r\nOthers the while lead forth the full-grown young,\r\nTheir country's hope, and others press and pack\r\nThe thrice repured honey, and stretch their cells\r\nTo bursting with the clear-strained nectar sweet.\r\nSome, too, the wardship of the gates befalls,\r\nWho watch in turn for showers and cloudy skies,\r\nOr ease returning labourers of their load,\r\nOr form a band and from their precincts drive\r\nThe drones, a lazy herd. How glows the work!\r\nHow sweet the honey smells of perfumed thyme\r\nLike the Cyclopes, when in haste they forge\r\nFrom the slow-yielding ore the thunderbolts,\r\nSome from the bull's-hide bellows in and out\r\nLet the blasts drive, some dip i' the water-trough\r\nThe sputtering metal: with the anvil's weight\r\nGroans Etna: they alternately in time\r\nWith giant strength uplift their sinewy arms,\r\nOr twist the iron with the forceps' grip-\r\nNot otherwise, to measure small with great,\r\nThe love of getting planted in their breasts\r\nGoads on the bees, that haunt old Cecrops' heights,\r\nEach in his sphere to labour. The old have charge\r\nTo keep the town, and build the walled combs,\r\nAnd mould the cunning chambers; but the youth,\r\nTheir tired legs packed with thyme, come labouring home\r\nBelated, for afar they range to feed\r\nOn arbutes and the grey-green willow-leaves,\r\nAnd cassia and the crocus blushing red,\r\nGlue-yielding limes, and hyacinths dusky-eyed.\r\nOne hour for rest have all, and one for toil:\r\nWith dawn they hurry from the gates- no room\r\nFor loiterers there: and once again, when even\r\nNow bids them quit their pasturing on the plain,\r\nThen homeward make they, then refresh their strength:\r\nA hum arises: hark! they buzz and buzz\r\nAbout the doors and threshold; till at length\r\nSafe laid to rest they hush them for the night,\r\nAnd welcome slumber laps their weary limbs.\r\nBut from the homestead not too far they fare,\r\nWhen showers hang like to fall, nor, east winds nigh,\r\nConfide in heaven, but 'neath the city walls\r\nSafe-circling fetch them water, or essay\r\nBrief out-goings, and oft weigh-up tiny stones,\r\nAs light craft ballast in the tossing tide,\r\nWherewith they poise them through the cloudy vast.\r\nThis law of life, too, by the bees obeyed,\r\nWill move thy wonder, that nor sex with sex\r\nYoke they in marriage, nor yield their limbs to love,\r\nNor know the pangs of labour, but alone\r\nFrom leaves and honied herbs, the mothers, each,\r\nGather their offspring in their mouths, alone\r\nSupply new kings and pigmy commonwealth,\r\nAnd their old court and waxen realm repair.\r\nOft, too, while wandering, against jagged stones\r\nTheir wings they fray, and 'neath the burden yield\r\nTheir liberal lives: so deep their love of flowers,\r\nSo glorious deem they honey's proud acquist.\r\nTherefore, though each a life of narrow span,\r\nNe'er stretched to summers more than seven, befalls,\r\nYet deathless doth the race endure, and still\r\nPerennial stands the fortune of their line,\r\nFrom grandsire unto grandsire backward told.\r\nMoreover, not Aegyptus, nor the realm\r\nOf boundless Lydia, no, nor Parthia's hordes,\r\nNor Median Hydaspes, to their king\r\nDo such obeisance: lives the king unscathed,\r\nOne will inspires the million: is he dead,\r\nSnapt is the bond of fealty; they themselves\r\nRavage their toil-wrought honey, and rend amain\r\nTheir own comb's waxen trellis. He is the lord\r\nOf all their labour; him with awful eye\r\nThey reverence, and with murmuring throngs surround,\r\nIn crowds attend, oft shoulder him on high,\r\nOr with their bodies shield him in the fight,\r\nAnd seek through showering wounds a glorious death.\r\n  Led by these tokens, and with such traits to guide,\r\nSome say that unto bees a share is given\r\nOf the Divine Intelligence, and to drink\r\nPure draughts of ether; for God permeates all-\r\nEarth, and wide ocean, and the vault of heaven-\r\nFrom whom flocks, herds, men, beasts of every kind,\r\nDraw each at birth the fine essential flame;\r\nYea, and that all things hence to Him return,\r\nBrought back by dissolution, nor can death\r\nFind place: but, each into his starry rank,\r\nAlive they soar, and mount the heights of heaven.\r\n  If now their narrow home thou wouldst unseal,\r\nAnd broach the treasures of the honey-house,\r\nWith draught of water first toment thy lips,\r\nAnd spread before thee fumes of trailing smoke.\r\nTwice is the teeming produce gathered in,\r\nTwofold their time of harvest year by year,\r\nOnce when Taygete the Pleiad uplifts\r\nHer comely forehead for the earth to see,\r\nWith foot of scorn spurning the ocean-streams,\r\nOnce when in gloom she flies the watery Fish,\r\nAnd dips from heaven into the wintry wave.\r\nUnbounded then their wrath; if hurt, they breathe\r\nVenom into their bite, cleave to the veins\r\nAnd let the sting lie buried, and leave their lives\r\nBehind them in the wound. But if you dread\r\nToo rigorous a winter, and would fain\r\nTemper the coming time, and their bruised hearts\r\nAnd broken estate to pity move thy soul,\r\nYet who would fear to fumigate with thyme,\r\nOr cut the empty wax away? for oft\r\nInto their comb the newt has gnawed unseen,\r\nAnd the light-loathing beetles crammed their bed,\r\nAnd he that sits at others' board to feast,\r\nThe do-naught drone; or 'gainst the unequal foe\r\nSwoops the fierce hornet, or the moth's fell tribe;\r\nOr spider, victim of Minerva's spite,\r\nAthwart the doorway hangs her swaying net.\r\nThe more impoverished they, the keenlier all\r\nTo mend the fallen fortunes of their race\r\nWill nerve them, fill the cells up, tier on tier,\r\nAnd weave their granaries from the rifled flowers.\r\n  Now, seeing that life doth even to bee-folk bring\r\nOur human chances, if in dire disease\r\nTheir bodies' strength should languish- which anon\r\nBy no uncertain tokens may be told-\r\nForthwith the sick change hue; grim leanness mars\r\nTheir visage; then from out the cells they bear\r\nForms reft of light, and lead the mournful pomp;\r\nOr foot to foot about the porch they hang,\r\nOr within closed doors loiter, listless all\r\nFrom famine, and benumbed with shrivelling cold.\r\nThen is a deep note heard, a long-drawn hum,\r\nAs when the chill South through the forests sighs,\r\nAs when the troubled ocean hoarsely booms\r\nWith back-swung billow, as ravening tide of fire\r\nSurges, shut fast within the furnace-walls.\r\nThen do I bid burn scented galbanum,\r\nAnd, honey-streams through reeden troughs instilled,\r\nChallenge and cheer their flagging appetite\r\nTo taste the well-known food; and it shall boot\r\nTo mix therewith the savour bruised from gall,\r\nAnd rose-leaves dried, or must to thickness boiled\r\nBy a fierce fire, or juice of raisin-grapes\r\nFrom Psithian vine, and with its bitter smell\r\nCentaury, and the famed Cecropian thyme.\r\nThere is a meadow-flower by country folk\r\nHight star-wort; 'tis a plant not far to seek;\r\nFor from one sod an ample growth it rears,\r\nItself all golden, but girt with plenteous leaves,\r\nWhere glory of purple shines through violet gloom.\r\nWith chaplets woven hereof full oft are decked\r\nHeaven's altars: harsh its taste upon the tongue;\r\nShepherds in vales smooth-shorn of nibbling flocks\r\nBy Mella's winding waters gather it.\r\nThe roots of this, well seethed in fragrant wine,\r\nSet in brimmed baskets at their doors for food.\r\n  But if one's whole stock fail him at a stroke,\r\nNor hath he whence to breed the race anew,\r\n'Tis time the wondrous secret to disclose\r\nTaught by the swain of Arcady, even how\r\nThe blood of slaughtered bullocks oft has borne\r\nBees from corruption. I will trace me back\r\nTo its prime source the story's tangled thread,\r\nAnd thence unravel. For where thy happy folk,\r\nCanopus, city of Pellaean fame,\r\nDwell by the Nile's lagoon-like overflow,\r\nAnd high o'er furrows they have called their own\r\nSkim in their painted wherries; where, hard by,\r\nThe quivered Persian presses, and that flood\r\nWhich from the swart-skinned Aethiop bears him down,\r\nSwift-parted into sevenfold branching mouths\r\nWith black mud fattens and makes Aegypt green,\r\nThat whole domain its welfare's hope secure\r\nRests on this art alone. And first is chosen\r\nA strait recess, cramped closer to this end,\r\nWhich next with narrow roof of tiles atop\r\n'Twixt prisoning walls they pinch, and add hereto\r\nFrom the four winds four slanting window-slits.\r\nThen seek they from the herd a steer, whose horns\r\nWith two years' growth are curling, and stop fast,\r\nPlunge madly as he may, the panting mouth\r\nAnd nostrils twain, and done with blows to death,\r\nBatter his flesh to pulp i' the hide yet whole,\r\nAnd shut the doors, and leave him there to lie.\r\nBut 'neath his ribs they scatter broken boughs,\r\nWith thyme and fresh-pulled cassias: this is done\r\nWhen first the west winds bid the waters flow,\r\nEre flush the meadows with new tints, and ere\r\nThe twittering swallow buildeth from the beams.\r\nMeanwhile the juice within his softened bones\r\nHeats and ferments, and things of wondrous birth,\r\nFootless at first, anon with feet and wings,\r\nSwarm there and buzz, a marvel to behold;\r\nAnd more and more the fleeting breeze they take,\r\nTill, like a shower that pours from summer-clouds,\r\nForth burst they, or like shafts from quivering string\r\nWhen Parthia's flying hosts provoke the fray.\r\n  Say what was he, what God, that fashioned forth\r\nThis art for us, O Muses? of man's skill\r\nWhence came the new adventure? From thy vale,\r\nPeneian Tempe, turning, bee-bereft,\r\nSo runs the tale, by famine and disease,\r\nMournful the shepherd Aristaeus stood\r\nFast by the haunted river-head, and thus\r\nWith many a plaint to her that bare him cried:\r\n\"Mother, Cyrene, mother, who hast thy home\r\nBeneath this whirling flood, if he thou sayest,\r\nApollo, lord of Thymbra, be my sire,\r\nSprung from the Gods' high line, why barest thou me\r\nWith fortune's ban for birthright? Where is now\r\nThy love to me-ward banished from thy breast?\r\nO! wherefore didst thou bid me hope for heaven?\r\nLo! even the crown of this poor mortal life,\r\nWhich all my skilful care by field and fold,\r\nNo art neglected, scarce had fashioned forth,\r\nEven this falls from me, yet thou call'st me son.\r\nNay, then, arise! With thine own hands pluck up\r\nMy fruit-plantations: on the homestead fling\r\nPitiless fire; make havoc of my crops;\r\nBurn the young plants, and wield the stubborn axe\r\nAgainst my vines, if there hath taken the\r\nSuch loathing of my greatness.\" But that cry,\r\nEven from her chamber in the river-deeps,\r\nHis mother heard: around her spun the nymphs\r\nMilesian wool stained through with hyaline dye,\r\nDrymo, Xantho, Ligea, Phyllodoce,\r\nTheir glossy locks o'er snowy shoulders shed,\r\nCydippe and Lycorias yellow-haired,\r\nA maiden one, one newly learned even then\r\nTo bear Lucina's birth-pang. Clio, too,\r\nAnd Beroe, sisters, ocean-children both,\r\nBoth zoned with gold and girt with dappled fell,\r\nEphyre and Opis, and from Asian meads\r\nDeiopea, and, bow at length laid by,\r\nFleet-footed Arethusa. But in their midst\r\nFair Clymene was telling o'er the tale\r\nOf Vulcan's idle vigilance and the stealth\r\nOf Mars' sweet rapine, and from Chaos old\r\nCounted the jostling love-joys of the Gods.\r\nCharmed by whose lay, the while their woolly tasks\r\nWith spindles down they drew, yet once again\r\nSmote on his mother's ears the mournful plaint\r\nOf Aristaeus; on their glassy thrones\r\nAmazement held them all; but Arethuse\r\nBefore the rest put forth her auburn head,\r\nPeering above the wave-top, and from far\r\nExclaimed, \"Cyrene, sister, not for naught\r\nScared by a groan so deep, behold! 'tis he,\r\nEven Aristaeus, thy heart's fondest care,\r\nHere by the brink of the Peneian sire\r\nStands woebegone and weeping, and by name\r\nCries out upon thee for thy cruelty.\"\r\nTo whom, strange terror knocking at her heart,\r\n\"Bring, bring him to our sight,\" the mother cried;\r\n\"His feet may tread the threshold even of Gods.\"\r\nSo saying, she bids the flood yawn wide and yield\r\nA pathway for his footsteps; but the wave\r\nArched mountain-wise closed round him, and within\r\nIts mighty bosom welcomed, and let speed\r\nTo the deep river-bed. And now, with eyes\r\nOf wonder gazing on his mother's hall\r\nAnd watery kingdom and cave-prisoned pools\r\nAnd echoing groves, he went, and, stunned by that\r\nStupendous whirl of waters, separate saw\r\nAll streams beneath the mighty earth that glide,\r\nPhasis and Lycus, and that fountain-head\r\nWhence first the deep Enipeus leaps to light,\r\nWhence father Tiber, and whence Anio's flood,\r\nAnd Hypanis that roars amid his rocks,\r\nAnd Mysian Caicus, and, bull-browed\r\n'Twixt either gilded horn, Eridanus,\r\nThan whom none other through the laughing plains\r\nMore furious pours into the purple sea.\r\nSoon as the chamber's hanging roof of stone\r\nWas gained, and now Cyrene from her son\r\nHad heard his idle weeping, in due course\r\nClear water for his hands the sisters bring,\r\nWith napkins of shorn pile, while others heap\r\nThe board with dainties, and set on afresh\r\nThe brimming goblets; with Panchaian fires\r\nUpleap the altars; then the mother spake,\r\n\"Take beakers of Maconian wine,\" she said,\r\n\"Pour we to Ocean.\" Ocean, sire of all,\r\nShe worships, and the sister-nymphs who guard\r\nThe hundred forests and the hundred streams;\r\nThrice Vesta's fire with nectar clear she dashed,\r\nThrice to the roof-top shot the flame and shone:\r\nArmed with which omen she essayed to speak:\r\n\"In Neptune's gulf Carpathian dwells a seer,\r\nCaerulean Proteus, he who metes the main\r\nWith fish-drawn chariot of two-footed steeds;\r\nNow visits he his native home once more,\r\nPallene and the Emathian ports; to him\r\nWe nymphs do reverence, ay, and Nereus old;\r\nFor all things knows the seer, both those which are\r\nAnd have been, or which time hath yet to bring;\r\nSo willed it Neptune, whose portentous flocks,\r\nAnd loathly sea-calves 'neath the surge he feeds.\r\nHim first, my son, behoves thee seize and bind\r\nThat he may all the cause of sickness show,\r\nAnd grant a prosperous end. For save by force\r\nNo rede will he vouchsafe, nor shalt thou bend\r\nHis soul by praying; whom once made captive, ply\r\nWith rigorous force and fetters; against these\r\nHis wiles will break and spend themselves in vain.\r\nI, when the sun has lit his noontide fires,\r\nWhen the blades thirst, and cattle love the shade,\r\nMyself will guide thee to the old man's haunt,\r\nWhither he hies him weary from the waves,\r\nThat thou mayst safelier steal upon his sleep.\r\nBut when thou hast gripped him fast with hand and gyve,\r\nThen divers forms and bestial semblances\r\nShall mock thy grasp; for sudden he will change\r\nTo bristly boar, fell tigress, dragon scaled,\r\nAnd tawny-tufted lioness, or send forth\r\nA crackling sound of fire, and so shake of\r\nThe fetters, or in showery drops anon\r\nDissolve and vanish. But the more he shifts\r\nHis endless transformations, thou, my son,\r\nMore straitlier clench the clinging bands, until\r\nHis body's shape return to that thou sawest,\r\nWhen with closed eyelids first he sank to sleep.\"\r\n  So saying, an odour of ambrosial dew\r\nShe sheds around, and all his frame therewith\r\nSteeps throughly; forth from his trim-combed locks\r\nBreathed effluence sweet, and a lithe vigour leapt\r\nInto his limbs. There is a cavern vast\r\nScooped in the mountain-side, where wave on wave\r\nBy the wind's stress is driven, and breaks far up\r\nIts inmost creeks- safe anchorage from of old\r\nFor tempest-taken mariners: therewithin,\r\nBehind a rock's huge barrier, Proteus hides.\r\nHere in close covert out of the sun's eye\r\nThe youth she places, and herself the while\r\nSwathed in a shadowy mist stands far aloof.\r\nAnd now the ravening dog-star that burns up\r\nThe thirsty Indians blazed in heaven; his course\r\nThe fiery sun had half devoured: the blades\r\nWere parched, and the void streams with droughty jaws\r\nBaked to their mud-beds by the scorching ray,\r\nWhen Proteus seeking his accustomed cave\r\nStrode from the billows: round him frolicking\r\nThe watery folk that people the waste sea\r\nSprinkled the bitter brine-dew far and wide.\r\nAlong the shore in scattered groups to feed\r\nThe sea-calves stretch them: while the seer himself,\r\nLike herdsman on the hills when evening bids\r\nThe steers from pasture to their stall repair,\r\nAnd the lambs' bleating whets the listening wolves,\r\nSits midmost on the rock and tells his tale.\r\nBut Aristaeus, the foe within his clutch,\r\nScarce suffering him compose his aged limbs,\r\nWith a great cry leapt on him, and ere he rose\r\nForestalled him with the fetters; he nathless,\r\nAll unforgetful of his ancient craft,\r\nTransforms himself to every wondrous thing,\r\nFire and a fearful beast, and flowing stream.\r\nBut when no trickery found a path for flight,\r\nBaffled at length, to his own shape returned,\r\nWith human lips he spake, \"Who bade thee, then,\r\nSo reckless in youth's hardihood, affront\r\nOur portals? or what wouldst thou hence?\"- But he,\r\n\"Proteus, thou knowest, of thine own heart thou knowest;\r\nFor thee there is no cheating, but cease thou\r\nTo practise upon me: at heaven's behest\r\nI for my fainting fortunes hither come\r\nAn oracle to ask thee.\" There he ceased.\r\nWhereat the seer, by stubborn force constrained,\r\nShot forth the grey light of his gleaming eyes\r\nUpon him, and with fiercely gnashing teeth\r\nUnlocks his lips to spell the fates of heaven:\r\n  \"Doubt not 'tis wrath divine that plagues thee thus,\r\nNor light the debt thou payest; 'tis Orpheus' self,\r\nOrpheus unhappy by no fault of his,\r\nSo fates prevent not, fans thy penal fires,\r\nYet madly raging for his ravished bride.\r\nShe in her haste to shun thy hot pursuit\r\nAlong the stream, saw not the coming death,\r\nWhere at her feet kept ward upon the bank\r\nIn the tall grass a monstrous water-snake.\r\nBut with their cries the Dryad-band her peers\r\nFilled up the mountains to their proudest peaks:\r\nWailed for her fate the heights of Rhodope,\r\nAnd tall Pangaea, and, beloved of Mars,\r\nThe land that bowed to Rhesus, Thrace no less\r\nWith Hebrus' stream; and Orithyia wept,\r\nDaughter of Acte old. But Orpheus' self,\r\nSoothing his love-pain with the hollow shell,\r\nThee his sweet wife on the lone shore alone,\r\nThee when day dawned and when it died he sang.\r\nNay to the jaws of Taenarus too he came,\r\nOf Dis the infernal palace, and the grove\r\nGrim with a horror of great darkness- came,\r\nEntered, and faced the Manes and the King\r\nOf terrors, the stone heart no prayer can tame.\r\nThen from the deepest deeps of Erebus,\r\nWrung by his minstrelsy, the hollow shades\r\nCame trooping, ghostly semblances of forms\r\nLost to the light, as birds by myriads hie\r\nTo greenwood boughs for cover, when twilight-hour\r\nOr storms of winter chase them from the hills;\r\nMatrons and men, and great heroic frames\r\nDone with life's service, boys, unwedded girls,\r\nYouths placed on pyre before their fathers' eyes.\r\nRound them, with black slime choked and hideous weed,\r\nCocytus winds; there lies the unlovely swamp\r\nOf dull dead water, and, to pen them fast,\r\nStyx with her ninefold barrier poured between.\r\nNay, even the deep Tartarean Halls of death\r\nStood lost in wonderment, and the Eumenides,\r\nTheir brows with livid locks of serpents twined;\r\nEven Cerberus held his triple jaws agape,\r\nAnd, the wind hushed, Ixion's wheel stood still.\r\nAnd now with homeward footstep he had passed\r\nAll perils scathless, and, at length restored,\r\nEurydice to realms of upper air\r\nHad well-nigh won, behind him following-\r\nSo Proserpine had ruled it- when his heart\r\nA sudden mad desire surprised and seized-\r\nMeet fault to be forgiven, might Hell forgive.\r\nFor at the very threshold of the day,\r\nHeedless, alas! and vanquished of resolve,\r\nHe stopped, turned, looked upon Eurydice\r\nHis own once more. But even with the look,\r\nPoured out was all his labour, broken the bond\r\nOf that fell tyrant, and a crash was heard\r\nThree times like thunder in the meres of hell.\r\n'Orpheus! what ruin hath thy frenzy wrought\r\nOn me, alas! and thee? Lo! once again\r\nThe unpitying fates recall me, and dark sleep\r\nCloses my swimming eyes. And now farewell:\r\nGirt with enormous night I am borne away,\r\nOutstretching toward thee, thine, alas! no more,\r\nThese helpless hands.' She spake, and suddenly,\r\nLike smoke dissolving into empty air,\r\nPassed and was sundered from his sight; nor him\r\nClutching vain shadows, yearning sore to speak,\r\nThenceforth beheld she, nor no second time\r\nHell's boatman brooks he pass the watery bar.\r\nWhat should he do? fly whither, twice bereaved?\r\nMove with what tears the Manes, with what voice\r\nThe Powers of darkness? She indeed even now\r\nDeath-cold was floating on the Stygian barge!\r\nFor seven whole months unceasingly, men say,\r\nBeneath a skyey crag, by thy lone wave,\r\nStrymon, he wept, and in the caverns chill\r\nUnrolled his story, melting tigers' hearts,\r\nAnd leading with his lay the oaks along.\r\nAs in the poplar-shade a nightingale\r\nMourns her lost young, which some relentless swain,\r\nSpying, from the nest has torn unfledged, but she\r\nWails the long night, and perched upon a spray\r\nWith sad insistence pipes her dolorous strain,\r\nTill all the region with her wrongs o'erflows.\r\nNo love, no new desire, constrained his soul:\r\nBy snow-bound Tanais and the icy north,\r\nFar steppes to frost Rhipaean forever wed,\r\nAlone he wandered, lost Eurydice\r\nLamenting, and the gifts of Dis ungiven.\r\nScorned by which tribute the Ciconian dames,\r\nAmid their awful Bacchanalian rites\r\nAnd midnight revellings, tore him limb from limb,\r\nAnd strewed his fragments over the wide fields.\r\nThen too, even then, what time the Hebrus stream,\r\nOeagrian Hebrus, down mid-current rolled,\r\nRent from the marble neck, his drifting head,\r\nThe death-chilled tongue found yet a voice to cry\r\n'Eurydice! ah! poor Eurydice!'\r\nWith parting breath he called her, and the banks\r\nFrom the broad stream caught up 'Eurydice!'\"\r\n  So Proteus ending plunged into the deep,\r\nAnd, where he plunged, beneath the eddying whirl\r\nChurned into foam the water, and was gone;\r\nBut not Cyrene, who unquestioned thus\r\nBespake the trembling listener: \"Nay, my son,\r\nFrom that sad bosom thou mayst banish care:\r\nHence came that plague of sickness, hence the nymphs,\r\nWith whom in the tall woods the dance she wove,\r\nWrought on thy bees, alas! this deadly bane.\r\nBend thou before the Dell-nymphs, gracious powers:\r\nBring gifts, and sue for pardon: they will grant\r\nPeace to thine asking, and an end of wrath.\r\nBut how to approach them will I first unfold-\r\nFour chosen bulls of peerless form and bulk,\r\nThat browse to-day the green Lycaean heights,\r\nPick from thy herds, as many kine to match,\r\nWhose necks the yoke pressed never: then for these\r\nBuild up four altars by the lofty fanes,\r\nAnd from their throats let gush the victims' blood,\r\nAnd in the greenwood leave their bodies lone.\r\nThen, when the ninth dawn hath displayed its beams,\r\nTo Orpheus shalt thou send his funeral dues,\r\nPoppies of Lethe, and let slay a sheep\r\nCoal-black, then seek the grove again, and soon\r\nFor pardon found adore Eurydice\r\nWith a slain calf for victim.\"\r\n                       No delay:\r\nThe self-same hour he hies him forth to do\r\nHis mother's bidding: to the shrine he came,\r\nThe appointed altars reared, and thither led\r\nFour chosen bulls of peerless form and bulk,\r\nWith kine to match, that never yoke had known;\r\nThen, when the ninth dawn had led in the day,\r\nTo Orpheus sent his funeral dues, and sought\r\nThe grove once more. But sudden, strange to tell\r\nA portent they espy: through the oxen's flesh,\r\nWaxed soft in dissolution, hark! there hum\r\nBees from the belly; the rent ribs overboil\r\nIn endless clouds they spread them, till at last\r\nOn yon tree-top together fused they cling,\r\nAnd drop their cluster from the bending boughs.\r\n  So sang I of the tilth of furrowed fields,\r\nOf flocks and trees, while Caesar's majesty\r\nLaunched forth the levin-bolts of war by deep\r\nEuphrates, and bare rule o'er willing folk\r\nThough vanquished, and essayed the heights of heaven.\r\nI Virgil then, of sweet Parthenope\r\nThe nursling, wooed the flowery walks of peace\r\nInglorious, who erst trilled for shepherd-wights\r\nThe wanton ditty, and sang in saucy youth\r\nThee, Tityrus, 'neath the spreading beech tree's shade.",
