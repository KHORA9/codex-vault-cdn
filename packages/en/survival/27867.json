PIKE, OF THE HARMONEONS\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTIVE: Opposite Harper's Ferry,--which is situated on a pleasant\r\nelevation at the junction of the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers--a few\r\nrods north of \"Pinnacle Bluff,\" a flighty eminence on the Blue Ridge\r\nMountains, stands a most singular formation of rock, known as\r\n'Washington's Face'; and which, to a casualist void of imaginative\r\npowers, is easily recognized if pointed out by a guide; but to a close\r\nobserver, however, with common discernable perception, it presents _at\r\nfirst sight_ a most striking and correct resemblance of _the great\r\noriginal_. From midway the bridge which crosses the Potomac, the\r\ncountenance and contour of the face _to me_, appeared discriminatingly\r\nperfect, and constrained me to look upon it as _one_ of the most\r\nwonderful, and the noblest work of revealed nature.\r\n\r\n  In the high barren cliffs of the Blue Mountain Ridge,\r\n  That frightfully hang o'er the trestle-built bridge,\r\n  Juts out into space a huge rocky bluff,\r\n  Which the elements rudely left broken and rough.\r\n  Near this, stands a bust so exquisitely fair,\r\n  That the chisel of art would be uselessness there!\r\n  For nature wrought well till the model was done--\r\n  An impress on stone of our GREAT WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n  The Earth born from chaos at some mighty shock,\r\n  Left the image to rest on the high mountain rock,\r\n  On a turret-like peak, in the heavens above,\r\n  _As a sentinel over the country we love:_\r\n  Where the sunbeam could linger till daylight had fled,\r\n  Where the bright stars of night, form a crown o'er its head;\r\n  And where, through the greenwood, the faintest breeze creeps,\r\n  To sigh for the Hero, who deathlessly sleeps.\r\n\r\n  There it stands like a giant in storm and in calm,\r\n  Like the Hero in battle, no foeman could harm!\r\n  And commandingly looks with a Patriot's pride,\r\n  On the wild mountain stream of Potomac's fast tide,\r\n  Whose waters swell on in the valley between,\r\n  Through the vast hilly regions and forests of green;\r\n  O'er a rock-bottomed track, to the blue-bosomed sea,\r\n  From its struggles to rest, like our sire of the free.\r\n\r\n  Stand up there in might, till the bright sun shall die,\r\n  Till the stars glimmer out their light in the sky,\r\n  And the moon shall no longer lend beauty or light,\r\n  But _all_ shall again be dark chaos and night,--\r\n  Till then, let its base be the tall craggy steep,\r\n  Where rocks are o'er moss-grown, and ivy-vines creep;\r\n  With the Heaven's wide canopy over its head,\r\n  _An immortal image of greatness that's dead._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VIOL SERAPHINE]\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.--The clear tones of a viol or bass viol are generally\r\nadmitted to be more melodious than those produced by other kinds of\r\ninstruments, and many have expressed a desire to see an instrument so\r\nconstructed as to be played with keys, like the organ or piano forte,\r\nand give the tones of the violin. This is the character of the\r\ninstrument here introduced. It is elegant in appearance; occupies less\r\nthan half the space of a piano forte, and is so light and portable\r\nthat a lady-performer may readily place it before her, and thus avoid\r\nthe necessity,--unpleasant to all parties,--of turning her back on the\r\ncompany. We do not say that an instrument of this kind has been as yet\r\nconstructed complete: but the principle has been proved, and it may,\r\nand probably will be soon, offered to the public, at a cost not\r\nexceeding sixty dollars.\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION.--In the engraving, a side view elevation only is\r\nrepresented, showing only one string and one key of a series of twenty\r\nor more of each. The body of the machine A B, is a light hollow chest\r\nabout three feet square and six inches deep, supported by four posts\r\nor legs with castors. Two bridges, C and D, extend across the breadth\r\nof the chest. The bridge D is supported by a cleat, E, in which is\r\ninserted the pin F, to which is attached one end of the string C D F.\r\nThe other end of the string is simply attached to the bridge C. A\r\nkey-lever, G H, passes through the bridge, and is mounted on a pivot\r\ntherein. The front end of the key (G) is held in its ordinary position\r\nby a small spring thereunder, and may be easily depressed by the\r\nfinger of the performer: the other end of the key serves as the\r\nbearing of the pivot of a delicate arbor, the opposite pivot of which\r\nhas its bearing in the bridge D. On the front end of this arbor is a\r\nwheel three-fourths of an inch in diameter, with its periphery smooth,\r\nand polished with rosin, or rosin varnish; and so adjusted, that by\r\nthe depression of the key, this wheel is brought up in contact with\r\nthe string, whereby, if in motion rotarily, a full sound is produced,\r\nas if a violin bow was drawn across the string. On the other end of\r\nthe arbor is a grooved pulley, over which passes a silken cord, which\r\nalso passes round a delicate band-wheel, I, below, and by which,\r\nmotion is communicated to the arbor and sounding wheel. The band-wheel\r\nis mounted on a shaft, I J, which has its bearings in two small head\r\nblocks which project from two crossbars: and from the block J is\r\nsuspended a vertical rod, to the bottom of which is attached a\r\ntreadle, K L, and from which a curved ratch, L M, extends upward and\r\ntakes to a small ratchet on the shaft I J; so that, by the horizontal\r\nmotion of the treadle, the motion is communicated to the wheel, &c.\r\nThe teeth of the ratch and ratchet have so gentle an inclination on\r\none side of each, that although the ratch applies force to the ratchet\r\nin the upward direction, they slide freely over in their return. It\r\nmay be understood that the machine is to have two treadles and two\r\nratches, which move forward alternately: and that twenty or more\r\narbors, pulleys, strings and keys are arranged in series, although\r\nonly one of each is represented in the engraving. The cord applies to\r\neach pulley in the series, by passing over the first, under the\r\nsecond, and over the third, and so on, descending from the last of the\r\nseries to the band-wheel. Each arbor is placed directly under its\r\nrespective string, and it is also proposed to place moveable stops\r\nunder the strings, at equal distances from the key bridge, and to\r\nregulate the tones by adjusting the stops, without depending on the\r\npins at the ends for that purpose. We shall employ a competent\r\nmechanic to construct one or more of these instruments as soon as\r\nconvenient, and give due notice accordingly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ECLIPSE IN ARABIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nCasting my eyes over the bright, full moon, I perceived that an\r\neclipse was just coming upon it. What astronomer had calculated this\r\neclipse for Arabia? It was indeed a privilege to witness one in the\r\nbright sky that over-spread the lonely mountains of Seir. Soon we were\r\nseated in a circle, with our Arabs round their watch-fire, enquiring\r\nof them their views of an eclipse, and explaining to them ours. They\r\nappeared to have no idea of its real cause, regarding it as a judgment\r\nfrom God, a sign of a bad season, and little camel feed. When we\r\nundertook to explain to them the theory of the earth being round,\r\nturning over every day, sometimes getting between the sun and moon,\r\nthey seemed to look upon us as telling very strange tales. The eclipse\r\nwas nearly total. I gazed upon it with interest, and then eyed the\r\nstrange scene around me. The wild, lonely landscape of rock and\r\nsand--the camels kneeling round the bivouac--the wild faces of the\r\nArabs, reflecting the red light of the fire round which they were\r\nseated--their wild voices and strange guttural language, all combined\r\nto produce an effect so startling, that I felt till then I had never\r\nbeen thoroughly sensible of our complete separation from the civilized\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGIVING CREDIT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"One of our exchange\" says one of our exchanges, \"came to us this week\r\nwith four of our editorials _not credited_.\" A frivolous complaint.\r\nNot a week passes but we find in some of our exchanges from ten to\r\ntwenty of our editorials; and instead of complaining, we are thankful\r\nfor being thus complimented.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOWIE KNIFE AND ITS INVENTOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis instrument was devised by Col. James Bowie, an American, and a\r\nman of desperate valor. He considered, and apparently with justice,\r\ntoo, that, in close fighting, a much shorter weapon than the sword\r\nordinarily in use, but still _heavy_ enough to give it sufficient\r\nforce, and, at the same time, contrive to cut and thrust, would be far\r\npreferable, and more advantageous to the wearer. He accordingly\r\ninvented the short sword, or knife, which has since gone under his\r\nname. It is made of various sizes; but the best, I may say, is about\r\nthe length of a carving knife--case perfectly straight in the first\r\ninstance, but greatly rounded at the end on the edge side; the upper\r\nedge at the end, for the length of about two inches, is ground into\r\nthe small segment of a circle and rendered sharp; thus leaving an\r\napparent curve of the knife, although in reality the upturned point is\r\nnot higher than the line of the back. The back itself gradually\r\nincreases in weight of metal as it approaches the hilt, on which a\r\nsmall guard is placed. The Bowie knife, therefore, has a curved, keen\r\npoint; is double edged for the space of about a couple of inches of\r\nits length; and when in use, falls with the weight of a bill\r\nhook.--Bowie went to Texas during the troubles which preceded the\r\nindependence of that country,--and was lying sick in bed at the\r\nfortress of the Alamo, when, on the 6th of March, 1836, it was stormed\r\nby Santa Anna and taken. Bowie was murdered there upon his pillow. The\r\nhand that formed the dreadful knife could no longer wield it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORESTS AND STREAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat remarkable man, Humbolt, has reduced it almost to a\r\ndemonstration, that the streams of our country, fail in proportion to\r\nthe destruction of its timber. And of course, if the streams fail, our\r\nseasons will be worse; it must get drier and drier in proportion.\r\nHumbolt, speaking of the Valley of Araguay in Venezuela, says that the\r\nlake receded as agriculture advanced, until the beautiful plantations\r\nof sugar-cane, banana and cotton-trees, were established on its banks,\r\nwhich (banks) year after year were farther from them. After the\r\nseparation of that Province from Spain, and the decline of agriculture\r\namid the desolating wars which swept over this beautiful region, the\r\nprocess of clearing was arrested, and old lands grew up in trees with\r\nthat rapidity common to the tropics, and in a few years the\r\ninhabitants were alarmed by a rise of the waters, and an inundation of\r\ntheir choice plantations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRUSSIAN MUSIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Boston Brigade Band has been presented with a copy of the\r\ncollection of the celebrated martial music of the Prussian army.\r\nPrussia has long been famous for the excellence of its military bands,\r\nand the music which they have produced is of the highest order.

H.) PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have frequently heard of singular and unaccountable reports, as of\r\nexplosion, in Deerfield, but nothing so definite as the following\r\nstatement by a correspondent of the Portsmouth Journal.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Editor,--During the last twelve years, certain curious, not to say\r\nalarming phenomena in the town of Deerfield, N. H., have excited the\r\nfears of the inhabitants, and we think should, ere this, have\r\nattracted the attention of the scientific. These are reports of\r\nexplosions in the ground, apparently of a volcanic or gaseous nature.\r\nWhen first heard they were attributed to the blasting of rocks in\r\nManchester, a new town some ten miles distant; but from the frequency\r\nof the reports at all hours in the night as well as the day, from the\r\nconsideration that they were so loud, and were heard in all seasons,\r\nwinter as well as summer, it was soon concluded that they had some\r\nother origin. The explosions, if they may be so called, commenced on a\r\nridge of land running S. E. and N, W, some five miles in length, and\r\nprincipally on that portion called the South Road. They have, however,\r\nextended, and arc now heard in a northerly direction. The sounds have\r\nbecome louder, and during the last fall and the present spring or\r\nsummer, as many as twenty have been heard in one night. Many of them\r\njar the houses and ground perceptibly, so much so, that a child whose\r\nbalance is not steady, will roll from one side to the other. They are\r\nas loud as a heavy cannon fired near the house, with no reverberation,\r\nand little roll. Last fall some of the inhabitants were riding in a\r\nwagon when an explosion was heard, and they saw the stone wall, which\r\nwas apparently quite compact, fall over on one side of the way, and a\r\nsecond after upon the other. The stone wall of an unfinished cellar\r\nalso fell in. This can be attested by many witnesses. There is no\r\nregularity in these reports, as they are heard at intervals of a day,\r\na week, and sometimes of months: but for the last year they have\r\nbecome very common, and are heard almost every week more or less.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRAORDINARY INSTANCE OF GAMBLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well known upon the western waters, that the firemen and other\r\nhands employed upon the boats spend much of their idle time in playing\r\ncards. Of the passion for gaming, thus excited, an instance has been\r\nnarrated to us upon the most credible authority, which surpasses the\r\nhighest wrought fictions of the gambler's fate. A colored fireman, on\r\nboard a steamboat running between Saint Louis and New-Orleans, had\r\nlost all his money at poker with his companions. He then staked his\r\nclothing, and being still unfortunate, pledged his own freedom for a\r\nsmall amount. Losing this, the bets were doubled, and he finally at\r\none desperate hazard, ventured his full value as a slave, and laid\r\ndown his free papers to represent the stake. He lost, suffered his\r\ncertificates to be destroyed, and was actually sold by the winner to a\r\nslave dealer, who hesitated not to take him at a small discount upon\r\nhis assessed value. When last heard of by one who knows him, and\r\ninformed us of the fact, he was still paying in servitude the penalty\r\nof his criminal folly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEN.

Two workmen,\r\nwho were at the time charged with transporting the wealth to the place\r\ndesignated were never seen, and it is supposed that they were\r\nsacrificed to the necessity of the secret. The Superior, at her death,\r\nbequeathed the secret to a lady friend, who in turn, on her death bed,\r\ndivulged it to her daughter, then 13 years of age. The child, now a\r\nsexagenary, disclosed it to the municipiality. Her statements have\r\nthus far been found scrupulously correct.

Without\r\nuttering a word she put the book in its place, grasped his hand,\r\nlooked him full in the face, and with quivering lips, heart big with\r\nemotion, checks bedewed with tears of maternal affection, she spoke:\r\n\"My son, I would not have you stay; your country has the FIRST claim\r\nupon you; be true to that as you have been dutiful to me, and Heaven\r\nwill protect you--KEEP THAT TESTAMENT IN YOUR VEST POCKET, OVER YOUR\r\nHEART!\"\r\n\r\nAfter faithfully serving the term of his enlistment, he returned to\r\nhis home.

He finally took marching orders _t'other\r\nway_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODES OF RAISING PONDEROUS ARTICLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA wedge is considered to be the most simple of \"mechanical powers,\"\r\nand is often used in cases where no other apparatus can be made to\r\napply; as in splitting logs and other adhesive articles. If a massive\r\nrock is to be elevated from the ground, a wedge must first be driven\r\nbetween that and its foundation, preparatory to the application of\r\nlevers. Yet the wedge is in most cases objectionable on account of the\r\nfriction with which its use is attended. The next, and most common\r\npower applied for elevating buildings on large rocks, is the simple\r\nlever, commonly called a pry. This usually consists of a long straight\r\nbeam or pole, one end of which is placed under the object to be\r\nraised, while a fulcrum consisting of a stone or block of wood, is\r\nplaced under the lever, at a short distance from the object to be\r\nraised. The opposite extremity then being forced down by the weight of\r\none or more of the workmen, a force is applied to the object to be\r\nraised, bearing the same proportion to that applied to the lever, that\r\nthe distance between the fulcrum and the extreme end of the lever does\r\nto that between the fulcrum and the object. Levers made of iron, and\r\nsimply denominated \"iron bars,\" are commonly used in raising and\r\nremoving rocks. A machine called a \"bed-screw\" is frequently used for\r\nelevating buildings. It originally consisted principally of a large\r\nvertical screw, which was placed on a foundation called the \"bed,\" and\r\nwas turned by levers; but many improvements and variations have been\r\nadded, till, in some instances, the screw has been dispensed with, and\r\na rack and pinion have been substituted. Some of the best in use\r\nconsist of a vertical iron rack, which is occasionally forced upward\r\nby the teeth of a pinion: a geer wheel on the same axle with the\r\npinion being driven by the thread of a horizontal screw, to the head\r\nof which is attached a crank. By a machine of this construction,\r\nproperly proportioned, one man may raise about twenty tons weight.\r\nVertical screws, turned by levers, have been frequently used for the\r\npurpose of raising vessels to repair. But in these cases a large\r\nportion of the power applied is lost in the friction of the screw, and\r\nthe process is laborious and tedious. This is probably the most\r\nawkward and injudicious method that has been applied to that purpose.\r\nAnother method which has been applied to the purpose of elevating\r\nvessels, is decidedly ridiculous, although less laborious than the\r\nformer. It is called the \"hydraulic power,\" and consists in forcing\r\nwater into large cylinders, by forcing pumps which are operated by\r\nsteam power; while the water thus forced into the cylinder moves a\r\npiston and piston-rod, to which is connected several stout chains,\r\nwhich passing over corresponding pulleys, descend to a platform, on\r\nwhich rests the vessel to be raised. An expensive apparatus, called\r\nthe \"Marine Railway,\" constructed on the principle of the _inclined\r\nplane_, with a huge and complicated carriage to travel thereon, has\r\nbeen extensively used for taking vessels out of the water to repair.\r\nThis plan is objectionable, however, on several accounts. It requires\r\nthe application of a great quantity of power to overcome the friction\r\nof its many axles and machinery, in addition to what is requisite to\r\novercome the gravity of the vessel. It is, moreover, injurious to the\r\nvessels which are taken up thereby, on account of its elevating the\r\nforward part, before the centre and stern become seated on the\r\ncarriage. The most judicious mode in present use, for raising vessels\r\nto repair, and which must be preferred to all others, where there is a\r\nsupply of water from an elevated reservoir, is on the principle of\r\nlocks; the vessel being floated into one apartment, is elevated by the\r\ninduction of water from above, till it can be floated over an elevated\r\nplatform, where it is left at rest, while the water is allowed to pass\r\noff below. The sides of this upper box or apartment, are moveable,\r\nbeing attached to the bottom or platform by hinge joints, so that they\r\nmay be let down to a horizontal position, thus giving the workmen the\r\nadvantage of light and convenience. The \"dry dock\" in the Navy Yard at\r\nCharlestown, Mass., is constructed awkwardly enough; but as the\r\nvessels at that place are not _raised_, it does not come under this\r\nhead. The massive stones which were used in the construction of some\r\nof the ancient edifices, were evidently raised by inclined planes. A\r\nhuge mound of earth was built up round the building, completely\r\nenclosing it; and the elevation of the mound kept pace with that of\r\nthe edifice: thus giving the laborers a chance to roll up the stones\r\nto their places. They used no other mechanical power than the simple\r\nwindlass and lever; and no other carriage than a drag, under which was\r\nplaced rollers. When the building was completed, the earth was taken\r\naway, and levelled about the vicinity. The modern method of raising\r\nstones for building, and which is now used in the building of heavy\r\nstone edifices, is by the use of a set of stout tackle blocks, the\r\n_fall rope_ of which is taken up by a geered windlass, operated by a\r\nsteam engine; the upper block being of course attached to an elevated\r\n_shears_ or derick. Vessels, and other bodies, which have been sunk in\r\nthe ocean, have been sometimes raised by means of airtight sacks,\r\nattached to different parts of the object by means of diving bells,\r\nbeen inflated with air, forced down through hollow tubes by pumps,\r\ntill they thus acquired a buoyancy sufficient for the purpose. The\r\npower of buoyancy has also been applied for elevating vessels above\r\nwater, by placing hollow trunks, filled with water, under the keel of\r\nthe vessel, and then pumping them out. One of the best methods that\r\nhas ever yet been proposed for raising vessels to repair, is to place\r\nunder the keel a horizontal platform, to which is attached four large\r\nhollow trunks under its four corners: the trunks to be filled with\r\nwater, and to have open apertures in the bottom of each. Then by\r\nallowing a stream of atmospheric air, to rush by its own expansive\r\nforce from the reservoirs in which it had been previously compressed,\r\nthrough suitable pipes or hose, into each trunk, the water is expelled\r\nthrough the apertures in the bottom, and the vessel is elevated\r\nimmediately, and without loss of time. In this case, the reservoirs\r\n(iron cylinders) of compressed air, may be recharged by steam or other\r\npower, during the process of repairing one vessel, and be thus in\r\nreadiness for another. A patent has been granted for this invention,\r\nbut it has not yet been put in operation on a scale of practical use,\r\nthough the patentee would willingly give the right of the patent to\r\nany person or company who should be disposed to construct the\r\napparatus on a large scale. We have recently given a description of\r\nMr. Spencer's plan for elevating vessels, and some other modes have\r\nbeen recently projected, which we may describe in a future number.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINFORMATION TO PERSONS HAVING BUSINESS TO\r\nTRANSACT AT THE PATENT OFFICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEC. 1. The existing laws relating to patents are those approved July\r\n4, 1836, March 3, 1837, and March 3, 1839; all former acts having been\r\nrepealed by the act of 1836.\r\n\r\nSEC. 2. \"Patents are granted for any new and useful art, machine,\r\nmanufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful\r\nimprovement on any art, machine, manufacture, or composition of\r\nmatter, not known or used by others before his or their discovery or\r\ninvention thereof, and not, at the time of his application for a\r\npatent, in public use, or on sale, with his or their consent, or\r\nallowance, as the inventor or discoverer.\" Act of 1836, section 6. \"No\r\npatent shall be held to be invalid by reason of the purchase, sale, or\r\nuse [of the invention,] prior to the application for a patent as\r\naforesaid, except on proof of abandonment of such invention to the\r\npublic, or that such purchase, sale or public use, has been for more\r\nthan two years prior to such application for a patent.\"--Act of March\r\n3, 1839.\r\n\r\nSEC. 3. The term for which a patent is granted, is fourteen years; but\r\nit may, under certain circumstances, be renewed for seven years, as\r\nhereinafter mentioned.\r\n\r\nSEC. 4. Patents are granted to citizens of the United States, to\r\naliens who shall have been resident in the United States one year\r\npreceding, and shall have made oath of their intention to become\r\ncitizens thereof, and also to foreigners who are inventors or\r\ndiscoverers.\r\n\r\nSEC. 5. A patent may be taken out by the inventor in a foreign\r\ncountry, without affecting his right to a patent in the United States,\r\nprovided the invention has not been introduced into public and common\r\nuse in the United States prior to the application for such patent. In\r\nevery such case the patent is limited to fourteen years from the date\r\nof the foreign letter patent. A patent is not granted upon\r\nintroduction of a new invention from a foreign country, unless the\r\nperson who introduced it be the inventor or discoverer. If an alien\r\nneglects to put and continue on sale the invention in the United\r\nStates, to the public, on reasonable terms, for eighteen months, the\r\npatentee Uses all benefit of the patent.\r\n\r\nSEC. 6. Joint inventors are entitled to a joint patent, but neither\r\ncan claim one separately.\r\n\r\nSEC. 7. An invention can assign his right before a patent is obtained,\r\nso as to enable the assignee to take out a patent in his own name; but\r\nthe assignment must be first entered on record; and the application\r\ntherefor must be duly made, and the specification signed, and sworn to\r\nby the inventor. And in the case of an assignment by a foreigner, the\r\nsame fee will be required as if the patent issued to the inventor.\r\n\r\nSEC. 8. The assignment of a patent may be to the whole or to an\r\nundivided part, \"by any instrument in writing.\" All assignments, and\r\nalso the grant or conveyance of the use of the patent in any town,\r\ncomity, State, or specified district, must be recorded in the Patent\r\nOffice, within three months from date of the same.--But assignments,\r\nif recorded after three months have expired, will be on record as\r\nnotice to protect against subsequent purchases. No fee is now charged\r\nfor recording assignments. Patents, grants, and assignments, recorded\r\nprior to the 15th of December, 1836, must be recorded anew before they\r\ncan be valid as evidence of any title. This is also free of expense.\r\n\r\nSEC. 9. In case of the decease of an inventor, before he had obtained\r\na patent for his invention, \"the right of applying for and obtaining\r\nsuch patent shall devolve on the administrator or executor of such\r\nperson, in trust for the heirs of law of the deceased, if he shall\r\nhave died intestate; but if otherwise, then in trust for his devisees,\r\nin as full and ample manner, and under the same conditions,\r\nlimitations, and restrictions, as the same was held, or might have\r\nbeen claimed or enjoyed, by such person in his or her lifetime; and\r\nwhen application for a patent shall be made by such legal\r\nrepresentatives, the oath or affirmation shall be so varied as to be\r\napplicable to them.\"--Act of 1836, sec. 10.\r\n\r\nSEC. 10, The Patent Office will be open for examination during office\r\nhours, and applicants can personally, or by attorney, satisfy\r\nthemselves on inspection of models and specifications, of the\r\nexpediency of filing an application for a patent.\r\n\r\nSEC. 11. All fees received are paid into the Treasury, and the law has\r\nrequired the payment of the patent fee before the application is\r\nconsidered; two-thirds of which fee is refunded on withdrawing the\r\napplication. But no money is refunded on the withdrawal of an\r\napplication, after an appeal has been taken from the decision of the\r\nCommissioner of Patents. And no part of the fee paid for caveats, and\r\non applications for the addition of improvements re-issues, and\r\nappeals, can be withdrawn.\r\n\r\nSEC. 12. It is a frequent practice for inventors to send a description\r\nof their inventions to the office, and inquire whether there exists\r\nany thing like it, and whether a patent can be had therefor. _As the\r\nlaw does not provide for the examination of descriptions of new\r\ninventions, except upon application for a Patent, no answer can be\r\ngiven to such inquiries_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nA sentimental writer says it is astonishing how much light a man may\r\nradiate upon the world around him, especially when the body he admires\r\nis beside him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the persons who recently laid in the Boston jail over Sunday,\r\nand were fined Monday morning for intemperance or rowdyism, were a\r\nmember of the bar and a clergy man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nSaid a bishop to a rough wagoner, \"you seem better fed than taught.\"\r\n\"Of course,\" replied the fellow, \"for we _feed_ ourselves, but for\r\nteaching we depend on _you._\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Reg(ulator?)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe use of a pair of conical drums in reversed position, and connected\r\nby a band, as shown in the cut, has been known for several years to a\r\nfew, but yet are not extensively known, and but a few of them have\r\nbeen seen in operation in this country. It will be seen that if the\r\nband be removed laterally, either to the right or left, the relative\r\nmotion of drums will be materially varied. These drums being arranged\r\nto constitute a connection of motion between the driving power and\r\ndriven machine, may be made to render the motion of the latter either\r\nregular or irregular at the option of the operator. If the band\r\nconnecting the drums, is governed by a shifting lever connected with a\r\n_governor_, it may be so adjusted as to keep the motion of the machine\r\nregular, although the driving power should be irregular in its motion,\r\nas is the case with a wind-wheel. But if the operator is engaged,\r\nrequires a move rapid motion at one time than at another, he can\r\naccommodate himself by shifting the position of the cone-band, to the\r\nright or left, as occasion may require. This is very convenient for\r\nturners, whose business requires at some times a rapid speed of the\r\nmandrill, and at other times a slow or gentle motion. These drums, as\r\nrepresented, must be swelled in the centre, that the band may be kept\r\nuniformly straight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA REMARKABLE MINERAL SPRING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may not perhaps be generally known even to our own citizens that\r\nthere is in the town of Riga, N.Y., one mile east of Churchville, on\r\nthe farm of Linus Pierson, a Mineral Spring, the gases from which are\r\nsufficiently combustible to burn as clear and brightly as a lamp, at\r\nall times of the day and night, and which is never exhausted. The\r\nspring is located near the bathing-house on the farm, and a tube has\r\nbeen constructed, leading from the spring to the rooms, by means of\r\nwhich the house is made sufficiently light without the use of lamps.\r\nSome time ago the State Geological Surveyors paid this spring a visit,\r\nand analyzed the gas, which was found to be composed of sulphurated\r\nand carbonated hydrogen. The water is strongly impregnated with iron.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOOL FORETHOUGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most admirable instances of prudential forethought we have\r\never heard of, occurred in Boston a few days since. Three Irishmen\r\nwere engaged in taking down a wall in Mount Vernon street. The wall\r\nfell upon and buried them. A lady from the opposite side of the street\r\nrushed out, and calling to those who were rescuing the poor fellows,\r\nsaid, \"Bring them in here. Bring them in here. I have been expecting\r\nthis all day.\" The men were carried into her house, and, true enough,\r\nshe had \"every thing ready,\" bandages, lint, laudanum, and all. If\r\nthis be not an instance of _cool forethought_, we know not what is.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIT MAY BE SO.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is stated in a Cincinnati paper, that the body of a drowned child\r\nhas been discovered by means of a loaf of bread in which was deposited\r\na quantity of quicksilver. The loaf was sent afloat in the canal, and\r\nafter floating some distance, remained stationary, and beneath the\r\nspot thus indicated, the child was found. That mercury may have a\r\nnatural attraction towards a human body, is possible; but the use of\r\nthe loaf of bread in combination, indicate a superstitious faith\r\nrather than real science.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral rich lead mines have recently been discovered on the\r\nMississippi River, a few miles above Bellevue.

We are not yet\r\nprepared to furnish a full description of this machine, but the\r\nfollowing claims, in the words of the patentee, may give some idea of\r\nthe various parts in combination. This machine was patented September\r\n10th.\r\n\r\n\"I claim the lifting of the thread that passes through the needle eye\r\nby the lifting rod, for the purpose of forming a loop of loose thread\r\nthat is to be subsequently drawn in by the passage of the shuttle;\r\nsaid lifting rod being furnished with a lifting pin, and governed in\r\nits motions by the guide pieces and other devices.\r\n\r\n\"I claim the holding of the thread that is given out by the shuttle,\r\nso as to prevent its unwinding from the shuttle bobbin, after the\r\nshuttle has passed through the loop, said thread being held by means\r\nof the lever, or clipping piece.\r\n\r\n\"I claim the manner of arranging and combining the small lever, with\r\nthe sliding box in combination with the spring piece, for the purpose\r\nof tightening the stitch as the needle is retracted.\r\n\r\n\"I claim the holding of the cloth to be sewn, by the use of a baster\r\nplate, furnished with points for that purpose, and with holes enabling\r\nit to operate as a rack, thereby carrying the cloth forward, and\r\ndispensing altogether with the necessity of basting the parts\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEERING APPARATUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. R. C. Holmes, says the United States Gazette, has invented a new\r\napplication of the tiller rope to the wheel for steering vessels, and\r\nhas prepared a model of the whole application, tiller-frame, wheel,\r\nand rope, so that the properties of the invention can be easily\r\ndiscovered. The advantages are that there is no slack made; and,\r\nconsequently, there is no chafing, and a single hand at the wheel will\r\ndo the ordinary work of two men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRO-MAGNETIC BOAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is stated in some of our exchanges, that Dr. Page, of Washington,\r\nhas perfected a boat to be propelled by the electro-magnetic power. We\r\nknow of no man better qualified to produce and introduce successfully\r\nsuch an invention, and we feel assured that whatever enterprise Dr.\r\nPage undertakes in that line, will be very apt to go ahead. We hope\r\nsoon to obtain further intelligence on the subject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is reported that the British government has granted $100,000 per\r\nannum to the royal company of Atlantic steamers, for the establishment\r\nof a post route to the Pacific, across the Isthmus of Panama.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENT IN BOATS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a model of a steamboat to be seen on the Chesapeake, invented\r\nand constructed by Cyrus Williams, Esq., which is exciting\r\nconsiderable interest among steamboat men. It is in the usual form of\r\na boat, but more flat-bottomed, and much longer in proportion to its\r\nwidth, than the boats now in use, giving it a greater surface to the\r\nwater, and of course a lighter draught. The improvement is in applying\r\nthe bridge principle of bearers in supporting length of boats. It\r\nlooks perfectly feasible. Mr. Williams thinks it will be a great\r\nsaving of expense, as it takes much less timber, and all of it can be\r\nsawed in a mill, being straight stuff. He offers to build a boat on\r\nthis model, furnishing one third of the stock, and if it does not make\r\n25 miles to the hour, he will forfeit his share.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTING IRON CANNON BY A GALVANIC PROCESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA hoaxical looking article, under the above caption, is going the\r\nrounds, and represents that successful experiments on this subject\r\nhave been recently made at Berlin. As no description or illustration\r\nof the process or principle is given, we leave the subject for those\r\nwho are ever ready to swallow whatever appears in a newspaper, without\r\nregard to probability.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW SHINGLE MACHINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the patents particularly noticed in the Commissioner's report,\r\nis one for a shingle machine, which cuts the shingles in a peculiar\r\nform. The shingles cut by this machine does not taper from one\r\nextremity to the other, but the taper is confined to about half the\r\nlength of it at one end, the faces of the remaining half being\r\nparallel to each other. This shape of the shingle avoids the bending\r\nwhich is incidental to those of the ordinary form, when nailed upon\r\nthe roof--an object well worthy of attainment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENT IN BLACKSMITHS FORGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis invention was entered at the Patent Office on the 15th instant,\r\nby James K. Hobbs. The improvement consists in the placing of\r\ngrate-bars at the bottom of the fire chamber, below which is an open\r\nair chamber into which the cinders and ashes fall through the grate,\r\ninstead of accumulating and clogging the fire chamber. The cinders may\r\nbe drawn out of the air chamber by an opening at the side of the\r\nforge. The blast is admitted above the grate, and the mouth of the air\r\nchamber being ordinarily closed, the blast is not affected by the\r\ngrate. We think it must prove a useful invention.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED FIRE ENGINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis improvement consists in part, in the arrangement of two sets of\r\nlevers and hand poles on each side, in such a manner that \"when force\r\nis applied to the hand-poles of the outside levers, in a reverse\r\ndirection to that which is applied to the hand poles of the inside\r\nlevers, both powers will agree in forcing the pistons of the pumps in\r\none and the same direction, while the reverse motion of the levers\r\nwill prevent the engine from rocking\".

Being bantered on the subject, he went to\r\nwork, and by means of a good lathe and boring machine, he actually\r\nproduced his cheese-press within the hour; though not very smoothly\r\nfinished. We give a sketch of it at the head of this article,--too\r\nplain to require explanation. Subsequently, several others were made\r\non the same plan.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAST IRON ROOFING.\r\n\r\n\r\nA specimen of cast-iron plates for roofing of buildings, says the\r\nPhiladelphia Ledger, has been exhibited at the Exchange, in\r\nPhiladelphia, by the inventor and patentee, Mr. Wm. Beach. The plates\r\nare about a foot square, and are made to fit one into another so as to\r\nrender the roof perfectly water-tight, with the application of white\r\nlead to the joints. In every respect this material for roofing is\r\npreferable to any other description now in use. As to its durability,\r\nthere can be no doubt that it would remain perfectly whole for ages,\r\nif covered occasionally with a coat of paint, and even without that\r\npreservative, rust would not affect it materially for a period of\r\nfifty years at least. As compared with copper, the cost would be\r\nnearly one half, as it is expected the iron can be furnished at 16\r\ncents per square foot, while copper would at the most moderate\r\nestimate cost 28 cents. As regards the weight of an iron roof, which\r\nat first sight would appear an objection, it is far less than one\r\nformed of slate, and does not much exceed one of copper. The iron\r\nplates weigh three and a half pounds per square foot. A slate roof\r\nwould cost about eight cents per square foot, but for durability, and\r\nthe ease with which it can be put on and made water tight, the iron\r\nroofing would appear to be far preferable. The plates exhibited were\r\ncast at Troy, New York, and are of the very best quality. The patent\r\nfor the eastern States is now owned by Mr. Hiram Hemmistone, of Troy,\r\nin which neighborhood the adaptation of such a durable material for\r\nroofing is rapidly attracting public attention there. Starbuck's\r\nmachine shop and foundry at Troy has been covered on this plan, and it\r\nhas also been adopted for the roofing of an arsenal at West Point.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW AND WONDERFUL PAVEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe presented in a late number, a brief extract from an article on this\r\nsubject from the \"Eureka,\" and should have thought no more of it, had\r\nwe not observed the following notice editorial in the N, Y. Farmer and\r\nMechanic. We copy the article entire, that our readers may judge for\r\nthemselves whether the style and statements savor most of reality or\r\nhumbug.\r\n\r\n\"NEW PAVEMENTS.--A new system of making streets has been made known to\r\nus;--but as it will be the subject of Patents, here and in Europe, we\r\ncan only give some of its most prominent features. A material or\r\ncomposition, of a very cheap character, has been invented, as hard,\r\nstrong and compact as flint. It is formed into any desirable shape in\r\nthe course of manufacture. From this, streets of any grade may be\r\nformed, and in such a way as to entirely secure a permanent and level\r\nsurface to its proper arch; it can be taken up in five minutes, so as\r\nto get at the water pipes, and on being replaced will, from necessity,\r\nresume its first position. In durability, it will last ten times as\r\nlong as granite, and twenty times as long as the common paving,\r\nwithout liability to require repair. It is so laid that frost and\r\nstorms cannot affect it. But we shall have occasion to refer to it\r\nagain\".--Persons wishing information may inquire of Kingsley & Pirsson,\r\nNo. 5 Wall street.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RENDER SHINGLES DURABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of our exchanges mentions an experiment which was made\r\ntwenty-seven years ago, of dipping shingles into hot linseed oil prior\r\nto nailing them on the roof: and although they have not been painted,\r\nthey are said to continue perfectly sound as when first put on. They\r\nwere of the common pine, and as much exposed as roofs in general. This\r\ninstance may be sufficient to establish the fact that shingles thus\r\nprepared, will last longer without painting than they could possibly\r\nbe preserved by painting in the usual way. As a security against fire,\r\nhowever, we should recommend that they be first dipped in a hot\r\nsolution of common salt; and afterward, when dry, be dipped in the hot\r\noil. The expense will be trifling, and there can be no doubt of their\r\ndurability, and there will be no danger of their taking fire from\r\nsparks or cinders.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEST PLAN OF A BARN.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps no building on the farm in the Northern States is of more\r\nimportance than the barn. Those who have had the charge of cattle\r\nduring our long winters, can at once see that much time and hard labor\r\ncould be saved by a judicious arrangement of stalls, and bay or bay\r\nlots, granaries, &c, so that every creature could be fed by taking as\r\nfew steps as possible. One very important thing to be considered, is\r\nthe best mode of preserving as well as collecting manure, so that it\r\nshall retain all its valuable properties in the spring, and be easily\r\ngot out. We like the plan of having a barn on the side of a hill, and\r\nso arranged that you may drive your cart load in pretty near the ridge\r\npole, and thus pitch most of your hay down instead of up. Having your\r\nstalls under the hay, you can continue to pitch the hay down, and if\r\nyou have a cellar beneath, you can throw the manure down also, and\r\nthus make the attraction of gravitation perform much of the labor of\r\ntransportation from the mow to the manure cart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Westfield, Mass., News-Letter states that there are between 25 and\r\n30 manufacturers of whips in that town, who employ not less than 1000\r\nbraiders, beside their shop hands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT FULTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert Fulton, a celebrated engineer, whose name is connected with\r\nsteamboat navigation, was born in the town of Little Britain, in the\r\nstate of Pennsylvania, in 1765. His genius disclosed itself at an\r\nearly period. He was attracted to the shops of mechanics; and at the\r\nage of seven he painted landscapes and portraits in Philadelphia. Thus\r\nhe was enabled in part to purchase a small farm for his widowed\r\nmother. At the age of twenty-one, he by the advice of his friends\r\nrepaired to London, to place himself under guidance of Mr. West, the\r\npainter, and by him was kindly received, and admitted as an inmate of\r\nhis house for several years. Prosecuting his business as painter, he\r\nspent two years in Devonshire, where he became acquainted with the\r\nduke of Bridgewater and with lord Stanhope, well known for his\r\nattachment to the mechanic arts. In 1793, he engaged in the project of\r\nimproving inland navigation, and in 1796, obtained patents for a\r\ndouble inclined plane, and for machines for spinning flax and making\r\nropes. The subject of canals now chiefly occupied his attention, and\r\nat this period, in 1796, his work on canals was published. In his\r\nprofession of civil engineer he was greatly benefitted by his skill in\r\ndrawing and painting. He went to Paris in 1797, and being received\r\ninto the family of Joel Barlow, he there spent seven years, studying\r\nchemistry, physics and mathematics, and acquiring a knowledge of the\r\nFrench, Italian, and German languages. In Dec. 1797, he made his first\r\nexperiment on sub-marine explosion in the Seine, but without success.\r\nHis plan for a sub-marine boat was afterwards perfected.--In 1801,\r\nwhile he was residing with his friend, Mr. Barlow, he met in Paris\r\nChancellor Livingston, the American minister, who explained to him the\r\nimportance in America of navigating boats by steam. Mr. Fulton had\r\nalready conceived the project as early as 1793, as appears by his\r\nletter to lord Stanhope. He now engaged anew in the affair, and at the\r\ncommon expense of himself and Mr. Livingston built a boat on the\r\nSeine, in 1803, and successfully navigated the river. The principles\r\nof the steam engine he did not invent; he claimed only the application\r\nof that machine to water wheel, for propelling vessels. In 1806 he\r\nreturned to America; he and Mr. Livingston built, in 1807, the first\r\nboat, the Clermont, 130 feet in length, which navigated the Hudson at\r\nthe rate of five miles an hour. Nothing could exceed the surprise and\r\nadmiration of all who witnessed the experiment. The minds of the most\r\nincredulous were, changed in a few minutes. Before the boat had made\r\nthe progress of a quarter of a mile, the greatest unbeliever must have\r\nbeen converted. The man who, while he looked on the expensive machine,\r\nthanked his stars that he had more wisdom than to waste his money on\r\nsuch idle schemes, changed the expression of his features as the boat\r\nmoved from the wharf and gained her speed, and his complacent\r\nexpression gradually softened into one of wonder. The jeers of the\r\nignorant, who had neither sense nor feeling to suppress their\r\ncontemptuous ridicule and rude jokes, were silenced for a moment by a\r\nvulgar astonishment, which deprived them of the power of utterance,\r\ntill the triumph of genius extorted from the incredulous multitude\r\nwhich crowded the shores, shouts and acclamations of congratulation\r\nand applause. In February, 1809, he took out his first patent. In 1811\r\nand 1812, he built two steam ferry boats for crossing the Hudson; he\r\ncontrived also a very ingenious floating dock for the reception of\r\nthose boats. In 1813, he obtained a patent for a sub-marine battery.\r\nConceiving the plan of a steam man-of-war, the government, in March\r\n1814, appropriated $320,000 for constructing it, and appointed him the\r\nengineer. In about four months, she was launched with the name of\r\nFulton the First; but before this frigate was finished, Fulton had\r\npaid the debt of nature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe population of Great Britain for the last ten years shows an\r\naverage annual increase of 230,000.

In this, however, we would not be\r\nunderstood to boast, of any peculiar evidence of taste of our own, as\r\nwe have been induced in this instance, to submit wholly to that of our\r\ntailors, who it must be conceded, understand these things much better;\r\nwhile we have only to regard alertness and independence of movement,\r\nwith a little vivacity, and intelligence of conversation.--Our general\r\nprinciples, and rules of self-government will continue according to\r\nour original pledge, and the policy pursued in our first volume: we\r\nshall endeavor to encourage and excite a spirit of enterprise and\r\nemulation in artists, manufactures and mechanics, while we present\r\nsuch instruction and useful intelligence in arts and trades, practical\r\nscience and new discoveries, inventions and improvements, as will add\r\nto the facilities of enterprise, and conduce to the prosperity and\r\nindependence of the working class in particular. And that we may\r\nfurnish an acceptable family newspaper, we shall continue to give in a\r\nbrief and condensed form, the most useful and interesting intelligence\r\nof passing events,--not omitting a small portion of serious matter,\r\nsuitable for Sunday reading, but avoiding the disgusting and\r\npernicious details of crime, with which too many of our public\r\njournals abound, and which evidently produces a deleterious effect on\r\nthe morals of the community. With regard to political and sectarian\r\nsubjects, however, we feel much inclined to change our style of\r\nneutrality so far as to advocate all parties, sects and denominations,\r\neach in its turn, which course may be more in accordance with our own\r\nmaxim of \"enlightening and pleasing,\" than either growling policy, or\r\nthe affected indifference and cold inattention which tends to produce\r\na reciprocity of coldness, and pleases none. On the subject of policy\r\nand rules, we might say more; but having already said twice as much as\r\nwe at first intended, and finding ourselves near the bottom of the\r\nscrap on which we scribble, we have only to find some suitable form of\r\nsentence wherewith to round off this subject; and for this purpose,\r\nwithout wishing to be suspected of any motives of interest, we would\r\ngently and respectfully suggest to our readers the propriety of\r\nadvancing the intelligence, enterprise and consequent prosperity of\r\nthe community, by introducing and recommending to the patronage of\r\nall, this same SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANTAGE OF LOW FARES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the month of July, 1845, when the fare between New York and\r\nBoston was reduced to the \"ruinous rates\" of only two dollars, the\r\nreceipts on the different routes were $45,208; but during the\r\ncorresponding month of the present year, with the fare up to four\r\ndollars, the receipts have been only $35,963: being _nine thousand two\r\nhundred and forty-five dollars_ less for a single month, than when the\r\nfares were at half-price.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAVALON RAILROAD IRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Covington Manufacturing Co. at their Avalon works, near\r\nBaltimore, are now delivering, under their contract, the iron for the\r\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad.

Much confidence is expressed by\r\nsome of the Vermont papers that the enterprise will be carried\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nIt is stated that the Magnetic Telegraph will extended from Washington\r\ncity to Richmond, and completed before the middle of December next.\r\n\r\nTELEGRAPH TO CANADA.--It affords us great satisfaction, says the\r\nMontreal Herald, to learn that there is a great probability of the\r\n\"lightning lines\"--the Electric Telegraph--being extended from the\r\ngreat cities of the United States to Montreal and Quebec. A gentleman\r\nis now in town, and has submitted proposals to the Board of Trade for\r\nmaking an immediate commencement with this most, important public\r\nwork. This line is expected to be extended to Montreal from Saratoga,\r\nto which place a line is already in operation.\r\n\r\nThe line between New York and Buffalo having been recently completed,\r\nthe following is reported to have been the first telegraphic\r\nconversation on the occasion.\r\n\r\nGENERAL CHAT BY LIGHTNING.--At one o'clock, P.

I wish to build another below with only\r\ntwenty feet head of water. How many square inches aperture will be\r\nrequired to discharge the same quantity in the same time? If some of\r\nyour correspondents will give me an answer, they will much oblige me.\r\nR. C. Navarino, Sept. 7, 1846.\r\n\r\nWe shall have no occasion to depend on correspondents for the\r\nintelligence above required. Thirty-six inches of aperture under\r\nthirty feet head, will admit the discharge of 660 cubic feet of water\r\nper minute; the velocity of the water being forty-four feet per\r\nsecond. Under twenty feet head the velocity is only thirty-six feet\r\nper second, and consequently forty-four inches aperture is required to\r\ndischarge an equal quantity.\r\n\r\n_Rule in Hydraulics_: (never before published.) To ascertain the\r\nvelocity of water issuing through an aperture under a given head:\r\nMultiply the head in feet by 62, and the square root of the product\r\nwill show the velocity in feet per second.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAILROAD INTELLIGENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Colony Railroad, from Boston to Plymouth, Mass., has for some time\r\npast been in full operation, and is doing a fair business.\r\n\r\nThe whole amount of the stock of the Michigan Central\r\nRailroad--$2,000,000--has been taken up, and of course the enterprise\r\nwill go forward.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of the opening of the subscription books for the\r\nstock of the New York and Boston Railroad, the people of Middletown\r\ntook shares to the amount of $350,000; and they expect to go up to\r\nhalf a million.\r\n\r\nThe Cheshire N.

It appears by the report of the\r\nboard of directors, that 5,364 shares had been taken up, amounting to\r\nabout £1,200,000. All parties appear to be confident that this road\r\nwill be constructed and in operation at an early day.\r\n\r\nThe Little Miami Railroad having been opened to Springfield, is doing\r\na fair business, and adds important facilities to trade in that\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nThe directors of the New York and Erie Railroad are said to be \"going\r\non with it in the right way to accomplish the great object of the\r\nundertaking.\" Contracts are already made for the construction of the\r\nroad as far as the valley of the Delaware.

The harbor\r\nitself is an oblong basin, surrounded by heights which usually shelter\r\nit from the wind.\r\n\r\nHavana is a place of considerable strength, and, besides the walls and\r\nditches which surround it, the city is defended by six strongholds,\r\ncalled the Moro, the Cobanas, No. 4, the Atares, the Principie and the\r\nPutna. The first and last serve to protect the entrance of the harbor,\r\nthe second is a sort of citadel and the others are so placed as to\r\ncover the approaches by land. The line of fortification, embraces a\r\nsort of irregular polygon of an eliptical form, the greatest diameter\r\nof which is 2,100 yards, and the smallest 1,200 yards in extent. The\r\nentrance between the Moro and Putna, castles is about 1,500 yards\r\nlong, and in its narrowest part 350 yards wide. In the arsenal of the\r\nHavana, there have been built 49 ships of the line, 22 frigates, 7\r\npacket ships, 9 brigs of war, and 15 schooners of war.\r\n\r\nThe town is built on the western side of the basin, near the channel,\r\non a kind of promontory. The suburbs, or _barrios esta muros_, cover\r\nmore ground and contain a larger population than the city itself, and\r\nyet they are so intimately connected with it, that the first of the\r\nhouses in the suburban street, stands on the very edge of the\r\n_glacis_.\r\n\r\nThe streets are narrow, crooked, and generally unpaved, but they\r\ncontain some well-built houses. There are, too, several good buildings\r\namong the churches, one of which contains the remains of Christopher\r\nColumbus. The other large edifices, as the Palace of the Government\r\n(shown to the right of the engraving,) that of the commandant of the\r\nmarine, the arsenal, the post-office, and the building used for the\r\nmanufacture of tobacco, are less remarkable for their architecture\r\nthan for their solidity. Besides these, the city contains nine parish\r\nchurches; six other churches, connected with hospitals and military\r\norders; five chapels or hermitages; the Caza Cuna, a foundling\r\nhospital; and eleven convents, four for women, and seven for men. The\r\nother public establishments are the University, the colleges of San\r\nCarlos and San Francisco de Soles, the Botanic Garden, the Anatomical\r\nMuseum and lecture rooms, the Academy of Painting and Design, a school\r\nof Navigation, and seventy-eight common schools for both sexes. These\r\nplaces of education are all under the protection of the Patriotic\r\nSociety and the municipal authorities. The charitable institutions\r\nconsist of the _Caza de Beneficiencia_, for both sexes, a\r\npenitentiary, a Magdalen Asylum, and seven hospitals--one of them\r\ncontains a lunatic asylum. There are, besides, three theatres, an\r\namphitheatre for bull fights, _plaza de toros_, and several public\r\npromenades, such as the Alameda and the Paseo Nuevo; In Turnbull's\r\n\"Travels in Cuba,\" published by Longman & Co., London, 1840, the city\r\nis said to contain 3,671 houses within the walls, all built of stone;\r\nand in the suburbs, 7,968, of various materials. The number of private\r\ncarriages for hire amounted, in 1827, to 2,651, and they are certainly\r\nnow more numerous. In the same year, the population was 122,023--the\r\nwhites were 46,621; the free negroes, 15,347; the free mulattoes,\r\n8,215; the negro slaves, 22,830, and the mulatto slaves 1,010.\r\n\r\nTurnbull, speaking of the _Real Caza de Beneficencia_, says: \"Girls\r\nare not admitted to the institution after 10 years of age; and, being\r\nentirely supported there, they are completely separated from their\r\nparents and their families, until the time of their final removal from\r\nthe establishment has arrived. They are taught the various branches of\r\nneedle-work and dress-making, and receive such other instruction as\r\nmay sufficiently qualify them for becoming domestic servants,\r\nhousemaids, cooks or washerwomen. They are not suffered, by the\r\nregulations, to remain in the house after the age of twenty-one: but,\r\nbefore that time, it is the duty of the _junta_, or committee of\r\nmanagement, to endeavor to procure employment for them earlier in a\r\nprivate family or in some house of business. Should the circumstances\r\nof the parents have improved during the stay of their daughter at the\r\ninstitution, they are not suffered to take her away until they have\r\npaid her previous board and education at the rate of fifteen dollars a\r\nmonth; but if the girl herself has acquired property by inheritance,\r\nor is able to improve her condition by marriage or otherwise,\r\nindependent of her parents, she is suffered to leave the house without\r\nany payment; and, in the event of her marriage to the satisfaction of\r\nthe junta, a little dowry is provided for her, amounting to $500, from\r\na fund created from prizes in the lottery, the produce of tickets\r\npresented to the institution. Six such marriages had taken place, and\r\ndowries bestowed from this fond in the course of a single year.\" This\r\nlottery business shows the spirit of gambling so largely developed in\r\nnations of Spanish descent. The Mexicans are noted for it, and Santa\r\nAna, who spent his exile in Cuba, and recently sailed from Havana for\r\nVera Cruz, indulged in the propensity to a great extent. But he had\r\ntwo strings to his bow, and whilst playing his fighting cocks was also\r\nplaying for an empire, and has won the game. How long he will hold it\r\nremains to be seen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUMOUROUS]\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMOROUS.\r\n\r\nA VERY LONG NOSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA gentleman having put out a candle by accident one night, ordered his\r\nwaiting man (who was a simple being) to light it again in the kitchen,\r\nadding--\"But take care, James, that you do not hit yourself against\r\nanything in the dark.\" Mindful of the caution, James stretched out\r\nboth arms at length before him, but unluckily, a door that stood half\r\nopen, passed between his hands and struck him a woful blow upon the\r\nnose. \"Golly gracious!\" muttered he, when he recovered his senses a\r\nlittle, \"I always heard that I had a very long nose, but I never\r\nthought it was longer than my arm!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOL.

But by far the better way is to take\r\nof each and every thing a view the most favorable. This course is\r\nevidently peaceable, else politicians and sectarians could not so\r\nuniformly applaud every act of their favorite sect or party, and as\r\nuniformly oppose and deprecate those of their opponents.

On taking my leave, he showed\r\nme a shorter way out of the house, by a narrow passage, which was\r\ncrossed by a beam over head. We were still talking, and as I withdrew,\r\nhe accompanying me behind, and I turning towards him, he said hastily,\r\n\"Stoop, stoop!\" I did not understand him till I felt my head hit\r\nagainst the beam. He was a man who never missed an opportunity of\r\ngiving instruction; and upon this he said to me: 'You are young and\r\nhave the world before you. _Learn to stoop_ as you go through it, and\r\nyou will miss many hard thumps.' This advice, thus beat into my head,\r\nhas frequently been of use to me.\r\n\r\nAnd I often think of it when I see pride mortified, and misfortune\r\nbrought upon people by their carrying their heads too high.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\"An ambassador\" is defined as a man sent abroad to lie for the good of\r\nhis country.

As a general rule, it is inexpedient for an\r\nassociation to publish a periodical. Instead of being an expression of\r\nthe society, it almost unavoidably becomes the organ of a clique, and\r\nrenders the patronage of an otherwise liberal organization subservient\r\nto private interest. In the columns of the \"N. York Farmer\" was first\r\nadvocated the formation of the N. Y. State Agricultural Society. Among\r\nthe first acts of this society was the issuing of an agricultural\r\npaper at _twenty-five cents_ per annum. This was scattered over the\r\nwhole country to the injury of those who had been pioneers in\r\npublishing agricultural papers. The Society could not sustain it\r\nwithout loss. It was sold to an individual on condition that he would\r\npublish the proceedings of the Society. The price was quadrupled. It\r\nwas soon found that a periodical having a general circulation, could\r\nnot devote much space to a local society, however noble and\r\nprosperous. Necessity led to the columns of the daily press, and to\r\nthe issuing of a yearly volume of Transactions. This will be the\r\nresult of every prosperous association. If the proceedings are worth\r\npublishing, the press will spread them over the whole face of the\r\ncivilized world. A collection of the most important and well-digested\r\npapers in a yearly volume, is more in accordance with the dignity and\r\nusefulness of a national association. Besides the injustice done to\r\nother periodicals previously in existence, the association adds\r\nnothing to its reputation by the undertaking. There are three or four\r\nindividuals at the American Institute who have a hankering for the\r\ncontrol of a paper. It is very easy to see that the publishing of a\r\nweekly paper by the Institute would be a suicidal act. All the\r\nInstitute has to do is to make its proceedings interesting, and the\r\nwidest publicity will be given as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nIt was natural to suppose that with such an array of editors,\r\neditorial committee, and of associate professors, the \"Eureka\" would\r\nhave done credit to the age, and claimed a rank, in point of\r\nliterature, with other monthlies. But candor leads me to say, I do not\r\nrecollect of having read a select journal with so many violations of\r\ncorrect writing. With the exception of two or three articles, the\r\nwhole number abounds with school-boy violations of the English\r\nlanguage. Redundancy and the want of appropriateness in the use of\r\nwords are the most common errors. Circumlocution and want of precision\r\nare common; and in many sentences all these and other violations\r\noccur, rendering it almost impossible to guess at the meaning.\r\nIndependent of \"_inflexibly_ in advance\" on the cover, the first\r\nsentence in the announcement on the first page is an instance of\r\nambiguity and careless construction. In the first article, on the same\r\npage, are several sentences indicating the same carelessness. The\r\narticle describing Hoe's cylinder press is a collection of\r\nbadly-constructed sentences. If your limits permitted I would give a\r\nwhole column of illustrations. The following sentences have so many\r\nfaults I cannot Italicise. They may serve to exercise your juvenile\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\n\"We intend to pursue the publication of the list hereafter, future and\r\npast; that is in our next number will appear those of August 20, and\r\nfollow for one month; also the list for one month prior to the 21st of\r\nJune.\"\r\n\r\n\"A material or composition, of a very cheap character, has been\r\ninvented, and hard, strong and compact as flint.\" \"From this, streets\r\nof any grade may be formed, and in such a way as to entirely to secure\r\na permanent and level surface to its proper grade and arch\".\r\n\r\nThree fourths of the sentences forming the article on Dr. Lewis'\r\nRailroad are very faulty.\r\n\r\n\"Hutching's Propeller. It consists of forming a set of oars, and by\r\ncams upon themselves, and a foundation-plate with cams to match, cause\r\nthe oars to revolve of themselves, when the main wheel, composed of\r\nthese oars, revolves.\"\r\n\r\n\"A patent is pending for the invention of a wheel, in which Mr. Wm.\r\nHulme, of Paterson, N. J, has made an invention.\"\r\n\r\n\"Russ's Pavement, There is no doubt it will make a good road in\r\ncomparison with our present streets, as far as surface goes; but we\r\nmust confess our incredulity of the entire success of this plan.

I\r\nwill pass by \"_protracted_ from beneath upwards,\" &c., and give a few\r\nmore quotations.\r\n\r\n\"Inventors scarcely ever receive the compensation due their however\r\ndistinguished merit, either pecuniary or laudatory.

We now come to our\r\nargumentative, on Novelty in Inventions. The reasoning powers of the\r\nwriter may be learned from the following:\r\n\r\n\"Thus we conclude that the _novelty_ of _an invention_ consists in\r\nmaking something 'useful to society,' and that in an original and\r\nnovel way, so as to embody the great principle of invention.\" Or, as\r\nfar as the writer has informed us, the novelty is the useful, the\r\nuseful is the original and novel, and the original and novel are the\r\ngreat principle, and the great principle is the novelty or something\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n\"We offer an explanation, not an apology for the want of a more full\r\nvariety of scientific matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fisher's Magazine publishes a complete list, comprising the Railroads\r\nof the U. States, as far as they are completed, and as far as\r\nparticulars are known.\"\r\n\r\n\"The French government has patronized an exploration of the island of\r\nCyprus, for the purpose of exploring its architectural remains.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the head of \"Editors' Table,\" I subjoin the principal and most\r\nimportant sentence:\r\n\r\n\"In this department we have but little room, and in this case it is,\r\nperhaps, well we have little, as it is seldom much in the way of\r\narticles for notice, are placed before an editorial corps before the\r\nappearance of the first number.\"\r\n\r\nWith the exception of three or four articles, the whole number is\r\ndiscreditable to The National Association of Inventors.

Prince Radziwill came to court in a carriage drawn by six\r\nwild bears;--the horses of course, were extremely frightened; in\r\nconsequence of which, some accidents happened. The king pointed out to\r\nthe prince the impropriety of his conduct. Radziwill added, that the\r\nbears were not cross, as whip, gold, and patience can put in order\r\nevery thing; He added also, that, sometimes the ace beats the king at\r\ncards, and paid liberally the damages. After some time, he gave a\r\nsplendid party, to which he invited all the ambassadors, and all the\r\nleading personages in Poland, and displayed extraordinary luxury. The\r\ndancing was kept up in several drawing rooms. After the supper, he\r\nconducted a select parly to a separate apartment--where, to their\r\nastonishment, they found four girls of uncommon beauty, richly\r\ndressed, in company not with four gentlemen, but with four enormous\r\nbears!--which, after the first outbreak of music, began to dance with\r\nthe girls all the figures of French quadrilles, with the utmost\r\naccuracy, and with as much ease as if they were highly educated\r\ngentlemen. At first the guests were alarmed; but, seeing the extra\r\nordinary tameness of the beasts, struck with amazement, they seemed to\r\nhave been pleased with this extraordinary sight. After the dance was\r\nover, their bear-ships conducted themselves with the utmost propriety,\r\nand, at a sign from the keeper, each of them made a bow to his lady,\r\nand withdrew to another room. For some time, nothing was talked of at\r\nWarsaw but that singular ball.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALL IS NOT GOLD THAT GLITTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA lady, at a ball lately given in Calcutta, attracted the attention of\r\nall, and excited the jealousy of many, in consequence of the splendor\r\nand brilliancy which her diamonds shed upon her person and all around\r\nher. At length that curiosity which is the moving spring of woman's\r\nactions, could be no longer resisted by her female admirers, who at\r\nthe close of the ball, instituted a rigid examination of the nature of\r\nthose incomparable brilliants, when, to their astonishment, they found\r\nthat they were no more or less than so many fire flies, which the envy\r\nof the ball-room had secured in gauze bags, and which as she moved\r\nabout, fluttered, and thus threw out their varied brilliant hues.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Odd Fellows procession to the dedication of their new Hall at\r\nPhiladelphia, says our exchanges \"_came off_ on Thursday\".

In painting common\r\nchairs, the ground is prepared by a coat of paint composed of ivory\r\nblack and rose-pink,--equal quantities, ground in a mixture of equal\r\nparts of linseed oil, drying japan and spirits of turpentine.--When\r\nthis is dry, the graining color, consisting of three parts of\r\nrose-pink with one of vermillion, ground in a mixture of oil, japan\r\nand spirits of turpentine, is applied with a common flat graining\r\nbrush. Fancy boxes and cabinet furniture are painted by a different\r\nprocess, by which a better imitation is produced. The ground is\r\nprepared by one or more coats of white lead changed two or three\r\nshades with yellow ochre. When dry, a thin staining of burnt\r\nterra-de-sienna ground in water, containing a very little sugar or\r\ngumarabic is laid on the work, and while this continues moist and\r\nflowing, the graining is applied. The graining should consist of a\r\nmixture of black and rose pink, ground in the staining compound. This\r\nmust be varnished when dry, with copal varnish. Some prefer, however,\r\nto grind the staining and graining in oil, diluted with spirits of\r\nturpentine. The learner must have some sample pieces of varnished\r\nrosewood before him when graining.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIA RUBBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe substance called India Rubber, or Caoutchouc, was not known in\r\nEurope until the beginning of the eighteenth century. It was\r\noriginally brought as a great curiosity from South America. Europeans\r\ncontinued ignorant of its origin until a deputation of the French\r\nAcademicians undertook a voyage to South America in 1735, for the\r\npurpose of obtaining the correct admeasurement of a degree of the\r\nmeridian. These philosophers did not confine their attention to the\r\none great object of their pursuit, but among other interesting\r\ndiscoveries made themselves acquainted with that peculiar\r\nsubstance--caoutchouc. These Academicians discovered at Emeralds, in\r\nBrazil, trees called by the natives _heve_, whence flowed a juice,\r\nwhich, when dried, proved to be what is called India Rubber. The\r\n_heve_ was also found growing in Cayenne, and on the banks of the\r\nAmazon river. It has since been discovered that caoutchouc may be\r\nobtained from another species of tree growing in South America, called\r\n_jatropha elastica_. If these trees are punctured, a milky juice flows\r\nout, which, on exposure to the air, thickens into a substance of a\r\npure white color, having neither taste nor smell. The hue of the\r\ncaoutchouc of commerce is black in consequence of the method employed\r\nin drying it. The usual manner of performing this operation is to\r\nspread a thin coating of the milky juice upon the moulds made of clay,\r\nand fashioned into a variety of figures. These are then dried by\r\nexposure to the heat of a smoke-fire: another layer is then spread\r\nover the first, and dried by the same means; and thus layer after\r\nlayer is put on, until the whole is of the required thickness. While\r\nyet soft it will receive and retain any impression that may be given\r\nto if on the outside. When perfectly dry the clay within is broken\r\ninto small fragments by percussion, and the pieces are drawn out\r\nthrough the aperture which is always left fur the purpose. The common\r\nbottle of India Rubber, therefore, consists of numerous layers of pure\r\ncaoutchouc, alternating with as many layers of soot.\r\n\r\nThe natives of those parts of South America to which these trees are\r\nindigenous, convert the juice to a variety of purposes. They collect\r\nit chiefly in the rainy season, because, though it will exude at all\r\ntimes, it flows then most abundantly. Boots are made of it by the\r\nIndians, through which water cannot penetrate; and the inhabitants of\r\nQuito prepare a kind of cloth with it, which they apply to the same\r\npurposes as those for which oil-cloth or tarpaulin, it used here.\r\nThis, no doubt, is similar to the cloth now prepared with this\r\nsubstance in America, the use of which yields so many important\r\nadvantages.--_Youths' Gazette_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION ON ATMOSPHERIC RESISTANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following letter has been on hand several weeks, but deferred on\r\naccount of a constant press of matter by which the limited space in\r\nour former small sheet was crowded. Our respected correspondent has\r\nconsented to excuse the delay.\r\n\r\n                                          Providence, ---- 1846.\r\n\r\n_Friend Porter_: In January last, I addressed a few lines to you,\r\nasking information in regard to an article entitled Atmospheric\r\nResistance, in the New York Mechanic, of December 11, 1841. In your\r\nanswer, you say if the full surface is 30,000 square feet to each\r\nwing, (which makes 60,000 square feet,) only about half of one horse\r\npower would be required to sustain this weight, and I understand you,\r\nvirtually to say, that they must be ten times as large, in order that\r\nthe strength of one man be sufficient to work this and elevate himself\r\ntogether with the apparatus, if it were not too heavy. Now, this makes\r\n600,000 square feet. This is rather more than 774 feet square: rather\r\nlarge sized wings. One would suppose that they might lift rather\r\nheavy, if they were very light, being 387 by 774 feet each. Now, to me\r\nthis is entirely incomprehensible, and I should like an explanation,\r\nif this calculation is correct, how it is that an eagle which\r\nsometimes weighs nearly thirty pounds, can elevate himself, with so\r\nmuch ease, and even carry with him nearly his own weight, using a pair\r\nof wings, which if they were five feet long and two feet wide each,\r\nwould make but twenty feet of surface. Thus, you will see, is no where\r\nin proportion to the weight even of the eagle alone, (which we will\r\nsuppose to weigh twenty pounds,) that the wings bears to the 150\r\npounds, while on the other hand, it is near in proportion to the\r\nsurface of the wings of a pidgeon and its weight. Nor can I comprehend\r\nwhy it would require so much power, the eagle though he exerts himself\r\nconsiderable in rising, no doubt, does not seem to use power any where\r\nin the proportion that you have thought would be required supposing\r\nthe wings to be made in the same proportion to the 150 pounds that his\r\nwings are to his weight, his beats are not so quick but what they can\r\nbe very easily counted.\r\n\r\n  By answering, you will much oblige,\r\n\r\n                          your friend,\r\n                              YANKEE.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the foregoing, we would remind our correspondent, that in\r\nhis former communication, he proposed a limited weight of apparatus,\r\nand in our answer, it was far from our intention to allow an\r\nadditional weight on account of the requisite extent of surface. With\r\nregard to the philosophy of the flight of the eagle, it must be borne\r\nin mind that atmospheric resistance is as the square of the velocity\r\n_downward_ and the only way in which the phenomenon of the flight\r\nof the eagle can be reconciled with the laws of mechanical science as\r\nestablished by experiment, is by supposing the velocity of the wing\r\ndownward to be equal to 70 feet per second, whereby a resistance would\r\nbe encountered equal to 12 pounds per square foot of surface to the\r\nwings. It is a fact, however, that kites, and hawks are often seen to\r\ncontinue suspended in the air several minutes without any apparent\r\nmotion of the wings; but by what law or theory the feat is\r\naccomplished, natural philosophy has ventured no other conjecture than\r\nthat the bird is endowed with the faculty of suspending occasionally\r\nits ordinary subjection to the laws of gravity. If any observing\r\ntheorist will give any more rational conjecture on the subject, we\r\nshould be glad to have him examine it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is proposed and urged by the papers in several States, to have a\r\nthanksgiving day throughout the Union, on the 26th of November.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As dull as a hoe,\" is a very common phrase, and implies that hoes are\r\nnecessarily or ordinarily dull.

It consists of a simple\r\nhorizontal windlass, with a crank at one end, as shown in the\r\nengraving. The windlass is made in a conical form, being a little\r\nlarger at one end, than at the other; and if the friction of its\r\nbearings be relieved by the ordinary friction rollers, it will so far\r\nmultiply the force applied, as to break a double inch-rope, by the\r\npower of one man at the crank. An endless rope, or one of which the\r\ntwo ends are spliced together, is passed five or six times round the\r\nsmall end of the windlass, and down under a single pulley below: then,\r\nas the windlass is turned by the crank, the rope is constantly given\r\noff from one part, while the circumference is greater. Now it is\r\nplain, that if the windlass is one-fifth of an inch larger in\r\ncircumference, at the point at which the rope is taken up, than at the\r\nplace where it is given off to the pulley, that whatever may be\r\nappended thereto, will be raised one tenth of an inch by each\r\nrevolution Then, if we suppose the crank lever to be fifteen inches,\r\nthe handle will travel about 100 inches, in each revolution, which\r\ngives a power, or increase of force, of 1000 to one. Therefore, if 100\r\npounds of power be applied to the crank handle, it will be\r\nsufficient--minus friction--to raise a weight of 100,000 lbs. The only\r\ninconvenience in this apparatus, and which prevents its coming into\r\nmore general use, is, that it is too limited in the extent of its\r\nmotion, in consequence of the travelling of the rope from one end of\r\nthe windlass to the other. Thus, if the windlass be but twenty-five\r\ninches long, and the rope one inch in diameter, it will admit only\r\ntwenty revolutions, without renewing. Yet, in many cases, in which an\r\narticle in required to be raised, or moved but a few inches, the\r\nconical windlass will be found preferable to any other method.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUISITE STRENGTH OF STEAM BOILERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur correspondent S. B. cannot comprehend that the strength of iron\r\nfor a cylindrical boiler should Be in direct proportion to the\r\ndiameter thereof, in order to sustain an equal pressure per square\r\ninch; wherefore, we must reason with him on the long scale. The\r\ncohesive strength of good iron is 64,000 lbs. per square inch; and of\r\ncourse, a strip of boiler-iron plate 1/8th inch thick will sustain\r\n8000 lbs. If a boiler made of thin iron is 14 inches in diameter, or\r\n44 inches in circumference, each inch of its length will contain 44\r\nsquare inches, and either half thereof will contain 22 inches, and as\r\nthe pressure on this portion is sustained by at least two inches of\r\nwidth of plate,--one inch on each side,--it follows that it will\r\nsustain a pressure of at least 700 lbs. per square inch, in the\r\ndirection of circumference. If the diameter is double, the number of\r\nsquare inches will be double, and will require double the thickness to\r\nsustain equal pressure. With regard to the pressure endwise, the area\r\nof a cylinder head 14 inches in diameter is 154 inches, and the\r\nstrength of the 44 inches of circumference would be sufficient to\r\nsustain 352,000 lbs., which, divided by the area, is 2,275 lbs. per\r\nsquare inch. If the diameter is 56 inches, the circumference being\r\n172, would sustain a pressure endwise of 555 lbs. per inch. Thus it\r\nwill be seen that if the cylinder were even 20 feet in diameter, the\r\niron would better sustain the pressure on the head that on the\r\nperiphery. With regard to the requisite strength of the cylinder's\r\nhead, if they are made in a semi-spherical convex form, they will\r\nrequire no more thickness of plate than the cylinder: but if they\r\nconsist of plane disks, the thickness thereof should bear the same\r\nproportion to that of the periphery that the area in square inches\r\ndoes to three times the circumference. But in general, no other rule\r\nis observed for the thickness of the heads, than to make them\r\nextravagantly heavy, without much regard to theoretic calculation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAGLEY'S GOLD PENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo our readers wish to hear any thing more about them?
