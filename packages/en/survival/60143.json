This modern legislation\r\nwas aimed at applying geologic knowledge toward the solution of today’s\r\nand tomorrow’s problems of an expanding population, mounting\r\nenvironmental concern, and the growing demand for mineral resources.\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC LEGISLATIVE CHARGES:\r\n\r\n  “Assist, consult with, and advise state and local governmental\r\n          agencies on geologic problems.”\r\n  “Promote economic development of mineral resources.”\r\n  “Evaluate the physical features of Colorado with reference to present\r\n          and potential human and animal use.”\r\n  “Conduct studies to develop geologic information.”\r\n  “Inventory the state’s mineral resources.”\r\n  “Collect, preserve and distribute geologic information.”\r\n  “Determine areas of geologic hazard that could affect the safety of or\r\n          economic loss to the citizens of Colorado.”\r\n  “Prepare, publish, and distribute geologic reports, maps, and\r\n          bulletins.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PRAIRIE\r\n                                PEAK and\r\n                                PLATEAU\r\n\r\n\r\n                   A GUIDE TO THE GEOLOGY OF COLORADO\r\n\r\n                      _by John and Halka Chronic_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Relief image of Colorado]\r\n\r\n                 COLORADO GEOLOGICAL SURVEY BULLETIN 32\r\n                                  1972\r\n\r\n               Available from Colorado Geological Survey\r\n                          1845 Sherman Street\r\n                         Denver, Colorado 80203\r\n                              Price—$2.00\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\nThis guidebook was written at the request of the Colorado Geological\r\nSurvey to fulfill a long-felt need for a popular account of the state’s\r\ngeology and its relationship to Man.\r\n\r\nThe authors wish to thank those of their colleagues who have assisted at\r\nvarious times in the preparation of this book. John Rold, Colorado State\r\nGeologist, and William Weber, of the University of Colorado Museum\r\nstaff, made many helpful suggestions concerning the manuscript. John\r\nSchooland, vice president of the Colorado Historical Society, generously\r\nprovided several pictures of early mining activities in Colorado.\r\nPermission to reproduce drawings and paintings of fossils and\r\nreconstructions of past environments was granted by the American Museum\r\nof Natural History and the University of Colorado Museum. Drawings,\r\nmaps, and diagrams are largely the work of Robert Maurer, who also\r\ndesigned the cover and title page.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tilted dark red sedimentary rocks of the\r\nPennsylvanian-Permian Maroon Formation are well exposed in the cliffs of\r\nMaroon Bells, southwest of Aspen.

They worked the sands and gravels of Cherry Creek,\r\nClear Creek, Boulder Creek, and California Gulch. Exhausting the placer\r\nsands of the stream bottoms, they moved higher to mine gold-bearing\r\nveins at Central City and Blackhawk. Mining camps sprang into existence\r\novernight, each heralding some new “strike,” each populated by a new\r\nrush of fortune seekers. As lower areas were mined out, prospectors\r\nmoved yet higher—to Breckenridge, Gold Hill, and Empire, Aspen,\r\nLeadville, and Cripple Creek. Silver was found as well as gold, then\r\niron, and later tungsten and molybdenum. The metallic ring of mining\r\ntools echoed from Colorado’s peaks. Fortunes were made here. Legends\r\nwere born.\r\n\r\nProspectors and miners were not, however, the first people interested in\r\nthe rocks of Colorado. Earlier, bands of nomadic Cheyenne and Arapaho\r\nIndians had searched Colorado’s hills for flint for arrowheads and\r\nbrightly colored clays for warpaint. Cliff-dwelling Pueblo Indians in\r\nsouthwestern Colorado sought clay for their pottery and fossil seashells\r\nfor the magic of their medicine men. And from farther to the southwest,\r\nNavajo tribesmen came to Colorado for turquoise.\r\n\r\nFrom clay to gold, much of Colorado’s wealth has come from her\r\nmountains. But after the rush to the mines, as veins were mined out and\r\nplacers worked over, as values and prices changed, her population sought\r\nthe riches of the prairies: fertile lands for agriculture, and in the\r\nrock layers below, black gold—vast accumulations of oil and natural gas.\r\nThe tablelands and plateaus west of the mountains yield their wealth,\r\ntoo. Here are valley farms, fed often by irrigation water, and ranch\r\ncountry. Here is more oil, and in some areas precious metals and\r\nuranium.\r\n\r\nIn recent years Colorado’s prairies, peaks, and plateaus have brought\r\nnew meaning to all America: the state now provides an attractive\r\nplayground for state residents and their visitors. Campgrounds, streams,\r\nlakes, and high trails beckon in summer; barren slopes deep in winter\r\nsnow attract the skier. More and more, those who live in Colorado and\r\nthose who visit her seek to understand these mountains and hills and\r\nprairies, to learn of her geologic origins and her far distant past. For\r\ntourist and resident, casual visitor, ski enthusiast, Sunday picnicker,\r\nfor all those who have met Colorado and enjoyed her, this book is\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Topographically, scenically, and geologically, Colorado\r\ncan be divided into the three provinces shown here.]\r\n\r\n  PLATEAUS\r\n    UINTA MTS.\r\n    GREEN RIVER BASIN\r\n    Yampa River\r\n    Steamboat Springs\r\n    UINTA BASIN\r\n    White River\r\n    WHITE RIVER PLATEAU\r\n    ROAN PLATEAU\r\n    Glenwood Springs\r\n    Colorado River\r\n    Grand Junction\r\n    GRAND MESA\r\n    Gunnison River\r\n    UNCOMPAHGRE PLATEAU\r\n    Dolores River\r\n    PARADOX BASIN\r\n    MESA VERDE\r\n  MOUNTAINS\r\n    NORTH PARK\r\n    RABIT EARS RANGE\r\n    PARK RANGE\r\n    MIDDLE PARK\r\n    GORE RANGE\r\n    FRONT RANGE\r\n    ELK MTS.\r\n    Aspen\r\n    SAWATCH RANGE\r\n    Leadville\r\n    MOSQUITO RANGE\r\n    Fairplay\r\n    SOUTH PARK\r\n    WEST ELK MTS.\r\n    Gunnison\r\n    Salida\r\n    WET MTS.\r\n    SANGRE DE CRISTO RANGE\r\n    SAN LUIS VALLEY\r\n    Rio Grande\r\n    Alamosa\r\n    SAN JUAN MTS.\r\n    Ouray\r\n    Silverton\r\n    Durango\r\n    MESA DE MAYA\r\n  PLAINS\r\n    Fort Collins\r\n    South Platte River\r\n    Denver\r\n    GREAT PLAINS\r\n    Colorado Springs\r\n    Arkansas River\r\n    WET MT.

There are a number of\r\nlocal variations of course, but by and large the provinces are clearly\r\ndefined. These three divisions will form the basis for our discussion of\r\nthe geology of Colorado, for the scenic differences are almost exactly\r\nparalleled, and usually controlled, by differences in geologic\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nThe Plains rise gently from an elevation of about 3350 feet at the\r\neastern border of the state to 5000 feet where they meet the mountains\r\n150 miles further west.\r\n\r\nTwo major rivers cross the Colorado Plains: the South Platte River,\r\nflowing northeastward from the Denver region, and the Arkansas River,\r\nwhich leaves the mountains at Canon City south of Colorado Springs and\r\ntravels eastward across the southern portion of the state. Tributaries\r\nof these two main river systems have etched the prairie surface, so that\r\nmuch of eastern Colorado has a gently rolling, hilly appearance.\r\n\r\nThe Mountains rise abruptly along a north-south line at about 105° west\r\nlongitude. They reach elevations of over 14,000 feet at Pikes Peak,\r\nMount Evans, Longs Peak (all visible from far out on the plains), and\r\nfifty other peaks further west. The ranges of the Colorado Rockies form\r\nrank upon rank of ridges and peaks, roughly north-south in trend, about\r\n100 miles across from east to west, extending from the northern to the\r\nsouthern border of the state. Here, in mountain springs and lakes, are\r\nborn the rivers of Colorado: the Platte, the Arkansas, the Yampa, the\r\nColorado. Crags and cliffs tower above tree-covered slopes, the rocks\r\nalways a dominant part of the landscape. The continental divide runs\r\nthrough the state along the summit ridges. West of the divide, all\r\nstreams flow to the Colorado River and the Pacific; east of it, streams\r\nflow into the Mississippi or the Rio Grande, and thence to the Gulf of\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nWest of the highest ranges, the country flattens out once more into the\r\nPlateaus, which extend across western Colorado, southern Utah, and\r\nnorthern Arizona. Here, the predominant land forms are flat-topped mesas\r\nand deep canyons. Redrock walls shimmer in the brilliance of the western\r\nsun, offset by deep purple shadows sometimes hiding ancient cliff\r\ndwellings. Fragrance of pine and juniper mingles with the pungency of\r\nsage. Narrow tracks lure the explorer. Despite the canyons, water is\r\nscarce except along major river systems, for this is the beginning of\r\nthe desert west.\r\n\r\nThe scenic and geologic division of the state into three north-south\r\nstrips is not everywhere clearly defined. In southwestern Colorado, the\r\nSan Juan Mountains and the complicated uplifts surrounding Ouray and\r\nSilverton are out of key with either mountain or plateau. They are best\r\nconsidered part of the Mountain Province, however, although they extend\r\nit far to the west. Other exceptions to these divisions occur also. The\r\nMountain Province is interrupted by four broad high-altitude valleys:\r\nNorth Park, Middle Park, South Park, and the San Luis Valley. The Uinta\r\nMountains jut into the northwest corner of Colorado from adjacent Utah.\r\nAnd the Paradox, Uinta, and Green River Basins protrude into the Plateau\r\nProvince, modifying its topographic character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pikes Peak rises to an elevation at 14,110 feet. Composed\r\nof Pikes Peak Granite, the mountain is almost surrounded by younger\r\nsedimentary rocks, including those of the Garden of the Gods, in the\r\nforeground. (Floyd Walters photo)]\r\n\r\nBefore discussing the geologic nature of the three provinces, let us\r\nreview briefly two sets of geologic terms. The first set has to do with\r\nthe rocks themselves—What kind of rock is that?—but serves also to tell\r\nsomething about the origin of the rocks. The second set is concerned\r\nwith time—When was that rock formed? Is it older or younger than\r\nadjacent rock? How does it relate, time-wise, to geologic events in\r\nother parts of the world?\r\n\r\nThese two sets of terms are presented in the charts that follow. If you\r\nare unfamiliar with geologic terminology, refer to these charts as often\r\nas you need to while you read this book, as well as to the glossary on\r\npages 114-118.\r\n\r\n  Geologists divide rocks into three main groups, depending on their\r\n  modes of origin.\r\n\r\n  _Igneous rocks_ originate from molten material, cooling deep below the\r\n  surface of the earth (intrusive igneous rocks) or flowing out and\r\n  hardening at the surface (extrusive igneous rocks).\r\n\r\n  _Sedimentary rocks_ are formed from broken or dissolved bits of other\r\n  rock, washed by wind and water and deposited as layers of fragments or\r\n  as chemical precipitates. They often contain fossil plants or animals.\r\n\r\n  _Metamorphic rocks_ are pre-existing rocks (igneous or sedimentary)\r\n  changed by heat, pressure, or chemical action.\r\n\r\n  Examples of these three classes of rocks are given in the accompanying\r\n  figure. Many varieties of all three classes occur in Colorado.\r\n\r\n  Class         Example       Occurrence in Colorado\r\n\r\n  Sedimentary   Sandstone     Plains, plateaus, flanks of mountain\r\n                              areas\r\n                Shale\r\n                Conglomerate\r\n                Limestone\r\n  Igneous       Extrusive:    Volcanic areas such as San Juan\r\n                   Basalt     Mountains, Spanish Peaks\r\n                Intrusive:    Pikes Peak, Longs Peak, and most\r\n                   Granite    central mountain areas\r\n                   Diorite\r\n  Metamorphic   Marble        Mountain areas\r\n                (from\r\n                limestone)\r\n                Quartzite\r\n                (from\r\n                sandstone)\r\n                Gneiss\r\n                (from\r\n                granite or\r\n                sandstone)\r\n                Schist\r\n                (from shale\r\n                or basalt)\r\n\r\n  Geologists arrange rocks in their chronologic sequence by studying the\r\n  fossils and minerals which they contain. The age of some rocks can be\r\n  determined with reasonable precision from ratios of radioactive\r\n  minerals and their fission products. The relative age of others can be\r\n  determined from their position, the fossils enclosed in them, and many\r\n  minor details of their structure.\r\n\r\n  The _stratigraphic column_ shown opposite may be thought of as a\r\n  calendar by which geologic events in Colorado can be arranged in their\r\n  proper order and related to events in the rest of the world.\r\n  Mississippian and Pennsylvanian Periods are American divisions;\r\n  elsewhere this time interval is known as the Carboniferous Period.\r\n  Other time terms are in worldwide use.\r\n\r\n  In the generalized geologic map of Colorado which accompanies Chapter\r\n  II, rocks are identified by the era in which they were formed.

We know this from the fossils they bear, fossils of large\r\nmammals such as the hairy mammoth, which lived in early Quaternary time,\r\nthe bison, and many smaller mammals living today.\r\n\r\nThe layers below—sandstones, shales, and limestones—become progressively\r\nolder as one goes deeper. Most of them were formed originally on the\r\nbottoms of shallow seas that covered this part of North America several\r\ntimes during the history of the continent. In most places the layers are\r\nhorizontal or nearly so, but westward, as they approach the mountains,\r\nthey bend upward, gently at first and then more steeply. At the very\r\nedge of the mountains, where they were dragged upward when the mountains\r\nrose, their eroded edges appear at the surface.\r\n\r\nThe entire sequence of flat-lying rocks can be studied where they are\r\nexposed along the mountain front or where streams and rivers have\r\ndissected them. They are also known from cuttings and cores of oil and\r\nwater wells. Some parts of Colorado’s eastern plains have been drilled\r\nso intensively in the search for oil and gas that we know a great deal\r\nabout the subsurface sedimentary rock and can even make maps showing the\r\ndistribution and character of the individual rock layers. From such\r\nmaps, the history of the region can be deduced. We know, for example,\r\nthat the area around Denver has subsided more in the past than has the\r\narea near La Junta or Lamar; it is called the Denver Basin because of\r\nits past history and not because it is a basin at present.\r\n\r\nAlthough the plains of Colorado appear flat, they really slope gently\r\neastward. The rock layers near the surface slope eastward also, but the\r\ndeeper rock layers may not.\r\n\r\nNear the western edge of the Plains Province, hills and valleys are\r\nformed by differential erosion of hard and soft rock layers. Some hills,\r\nsuch as Castle Rock, are topped with resistant sandstone; others, like\r\nMesa de Maya south of Trinidad and Table Mountain near Golden, are\r\ncapped with layers of basalt. Close to the mountains flat-topped\r\nfoothills result from partial dissection of former erosion surfaces as\r\nthe mountains, stabilized for a time, rose again, or as climatic cycles\r\nchanged. Examples of these dissected erosion surfaces can be seen north\r\nand south of Boulder.\r\n\r\nFar east of the mountain front, near the northern border of Colorado,\r\nremnants of another, higher prairie surface stand as Pawnee Buttes.\r\nTorrential erosion—spring floods and summer thunderstorms—has deeply\r\nfurrowed the prairie surface here and left these buttes as lonely\r\nsentinels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This map shows the distribution, character, and thickness\r\nof certain Jurassic rocks in Colorado. These rocks are deeply buried\r\nbeneath the plains and are known there only from well samples. They have\r\nbeen eroded from most mountain areas. They come to the surface along the\r\nedges of the mountains and in the deeply incised canyons of the Plateau\r\nProvince.]\r\n\r\n  PRECAMBRIAN ROCKS\r\n  PALEOZOIC ROCKS\r\n  JURASSIC ROCKS\r\n    SANDSTONE\r\n    SHALY SANDSTONE\r\n    SANDY SHALE\r\n    SHALE\r\n  JURASSIC ROCKS COVERED WITH VOLCANICS OR NEVER DEPOSITED.\r\n\r\nWhat lies below the sedimentary layers of the plains? The sedimentary\r\nrocks are 5,000 to 10,000 feet thick. They lie on an almost horizontal\r\nsurface of much, much older rock, the Precambrian or “basement” rock.\r\nThis is igneous and metamorphic rock, much crumpled and folded, the\r\nroots of long gone mountains which were beveled and leveled to an almost\r\nflat surface or _peneplain_ perhaps a billion years ago.\r\n\r\nWe know little of the ancient basement rocks below the sedimentary\r\nlayers of the plains, for few wells penetrate this deep. What we do know\r\nindicates that they are similar to rocks of the mountain masses to the\r\nwest, and are composed of granite, schist, and gneiss. They probably are\r\nnot rich in valuable minerals, however, for the mineral-rich veins of\r\nthe mountains came about as a result of uplift of the mountain areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE PEAKS\r\n\r\nMost of the individual ranges making up the Rocky Mountains in Colorado\r\nare the result of highly localized movements of the crust as the entire\r\nregion was thrust upward from below. These movements broke the deep,\r\nmassive igneous and metamorphic rocks of the Precambrian basement, and\r\nbent the more flexible Paleozoic and Mesozoic layered rocks above them\r\nuntil they arched upward in a series of corrugations. The mountains thus\r\nformed are known to geologists as _faulted anticlines_.\r\n\r\nAs the mountains rose, they were of course attacked by the forces of\r\nerosion. The sedimentary layers were completely stripped from the crests\r\nof many of the uplifts, so that Precambrian rocks were exposed. It is\r\nthese rocks which form the summits of the highest peaks of Colorado. As\r\nwith all rules, there are exceptions: the Spanish Peaks are volcanic,\r\nand the crest of the Sangre de Cristo Range is composed of sedimentary\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nThe trend of most of the ranges in Colorado is north-south, swinging to\r\nnorthwest-southeast near the southern end. Surprisingly, in the\r\nnorthwestern corner of the state there is an east-west trending range,\r\nthe Uinta Mountains.\r\n\r\nFifty or more mountain ridges in Colorado have been named as separate\r\nranges. Of these, the most prominent, frequently visited ones will be\r\ndiscussed here.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Front Range\r\n\r\nThe easternmost range of the Rocky Mountains is the longest continuous\r\nuplift in the state. It is a relatively simple faulted anticline\r\nextending from Canon City northward to the Wyoming border, where it\r\nsplits into two ridges, the Medicine Bow Mountains and the Laramie\r\nRange.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Longs Peak challenges technical climbers with its\r\n2000-foot vertical east face, the Diamond. This magnificent cliff is the\r\nresult of glacial action and freezing and thawing in homogeneous but\r\nfractured granite. The small remnant of ice and snow at the lower left\r\nis all that remains of the glacier. The flat summit may be part of an\r\nancient erosion surface formed toward the end of Precambrian time. (Jack\r\nRathbone photo)]\r\n\r\nAlong the highest portion of the range, from Pikes Peak to Rocky\r\nMountain National Park, the Paleozoic and Mesozoic sediments formerly\r\ndraped over the top of the range have long since been washed away,\r\nleaving only the gneiss, granite, and schist of the mountain core. The\r\nalmost flat tops of Longs Peak, Mt. Evans, and Pikes Peak, and the\r\nrolling upland traversed by Trail Ridge Road in Rocky Mountain National\r\nPark are thought to be remnants of the 600-million-year-old erosion\r\nsurface that once existed at the top of the Precambrian rocks, and that\r\nstill exists below the sedimentary rocks of the Plains Province. This\r\nsurface, formed near sea level, has been raised 12,000 to 14,000 feet\r\nwithin the Mountain Province.\r\n\r\nThroughout most of its length, the Front Range displays some of the most\r\nstriking high-altitude scenery in the world. Particularly accessible\r\nareas, well worthy of visits, are Rocky Mountain National Park, Berthoud\r\nand Loveland Passes, Mt. Evans, and Pikes Peak. In these areas the\r\nPrecambrian rocks can be seen and studied, and the effects of glaciation\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nThe granite, gneiss, and schist of the mountain core are shattered and\r\nbroken into blocks of various sizes. The breaks between the blocks are\r\ncalled _joints_ if there is no apparent displacement between adjacent\r\nblocks, and _faults_ where there is obvious displacement. The joints\r\nfrequently appear in parallel arrays or sets; there may be two or more\r\nintersecting sets, giving a cross-hatched appearance to large exposures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: East-west profile across Rocky Mountain National Park,\r\nthrough Grand Lake and Longs Peak, showing the inferred position of the\r\noriginal surface of the anticlinal uplift of the Front Range.

(Floyd Walters\r\nphoto)]\r\n\r\nThe Precambrian rocks vary from place to place. Several irregular masses\r\nof granite, called _batholiths_, make up portions of the range.\r\nBatholiths are large intrusions of molten rock that cooled slowly at\r\ngreat depth. The minerals in them form distinct crystals, often quite\r\nlarge. The Pikes Peak Granite and the Boulder Creek Granite are\r\nexamples. Highly contorted and banded gneiss and schist are well exposed\r\nelsewhere, particularly in the Idaho Springs-Central City-Black Hawk\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nAlong the flanks of the Front Range, the eroded edges of the sedimentary\r\nrocks which once covered the range are exposed. These rocks are usually\r\ntilted sharply against the mountains, as at Garden of the Gods, Denver’s\r\nRed Rocks Park, and the Flatirons near Boulder. The Rocky Mountain\r\nAssociation of Geologists has erected a plaque explaining the geology of\r\nthe Red Rocks area; look for it about half a mile northeast of the Red\r\nRocks Amphitheater. Tilted layers of Paleozoic and Mesozoic sandstones\r\nform hogback ridges along the mountain front, and stand out clearly on\r\naerial photographs.\r\n\r\nIn some areas, particularly near Boulder, Coal Creek, and Golden, the\r\ntilting of the sedimentary layers has been so extreme that the layers\r\nare upside down. Basement rocks may even be thrust out above them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sandstones and conglomerates of the Pennsylvanian\r\nFountain Formation dip steeply toward the plains along the eastern edge\r\nof the Rockies. Near Denver, erosion has carved these rocks into a\r\nnatural amphitheater, now the site of Red Rocks Amphitheater.\r\nPrecambrian granite forms the hill in the background. (Jack Rathbone\r\nphoto)]\r\n\r\nFurther north, near Loveland and Lyons, as well as further south at\r\nColorado Springs, irregularities in the uplift have caused abrupt breaks\r\nin the generally smooth eastern edge of the range. Folds and faults in\r\nthese areas trend northwest, cutting across and offsetting the mountain\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: South of Colorado Springs, between Fort Carson and the\r\nNORAD installation in Cheyenne Mountain, Mesozoic rocks are faulted\r\nagainst the mountain front. Paleozoic rocks are deeply covered by as\r\nmuch as 3000 feet of Mesozoic sediments. They come to the surface about\r\n10 miles further south.]\r\n\r\n  RAMPART RANGE\r\n    Garden of the Gods\r\n    Ute Pass Fault\r\n  MANITOU SPRINGS\r\n  PIKES PEAK MASSIF\r\n  CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN\r\n    COLORADO SPRINGS\r\n  CROSS SECTION\r\n    Ute Pass Fault\r\n    Rampart Fault\r\n      Tertiary\r\n      Mesozoic\r\n      Paleozoic\r\n      Precambrian\r\n\r\n[Illustration: West of Boulder, several intersecting sets of joints\r\npattern the Precambrian rocks above Boulder Creek. (John Chronic photo)]\r\n\r\nThe west margin of the Front Range is not as sharply defined as the\r\neastern margin. Prominent faults edge North, Middle, and South Parks,\r\nhowever. The northern end of the range merges with the Medicine Bow\r\nMountains, where dips of sedimentary rocks seldom exceed 30 to 40\r\ndegrees. At its southern end, the Front Range plunges into the plains,\r\nalthough a southwest-trending ridge connects it with the Wet Mountains.\r\n\r\nWithin the Precambrian core of the Front Range, many economic mineral\r\ndeposits have been found. These are discussed in Chapter III. Glacial\r\nfeatures of the Front Range are discussed in Chapter II in the section\r\non the Quaternary Period.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Wet Mountains\r\n\r\nThe Wet Mountains are the easternmost range of the Rockies south of\r\nCanon City. Their crest has a distinct northwest-southeast trend, with\r\nthe north end offset about 25 miles westward from the south end of the\r\nFront Range. The Canon City Embayment lies at the junction between the\r\nranges.\r\n\r\nThough smaller and lower than the Front Range, the Wet Mountains include\r\nmany pleasant and easily accessible recreation areas and a number of\r\nattractive streams and reservoirs. Greenhorn Peak, the summit of the\r\nrange, is 12,334 feet high. It is formed of Precambrian granite, as is\r\nmost of the crest of the range.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the eastern side of the Wet Mountains is similar to\r\nthat of the Front Range, except that there are more faults in the\r\nsedimentary layers. The southern end plunges southeastward into the\r\nplains. On the western side, westward-dipping sediments are completely\r\nsubmerged in Cenozoic lava flows and debris from the mountains. Ore\r\nminerals very like those of the Front Range occur near Silver Cliff, but\r\nthey have so far proved to be of little economic importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Sangre de Cristo Range and Spanish Peaks\r\n\r\nThe Sangre de Cristo Mountains are visible from many parts of\r\nsoutheastern Colorado as a jagged, sawtoothed, snow-crested ridge on the\r\nwestern skyline. They extend about 150 miles from the Arkansas River\r\nnear Salida southward into New Mexico.\r\n\r\nFew mountain ranges form so impassable a barrier as the Sangre de\r\nCristos. Only at La Veta Pass does a highway cross the range. However,\r\nold wagon roads, passable now by jeep or on foot, once existed across\r\nHayden, Music, Mosca, and Whiskey Creek Passes.\r\n\r\nOften no more than twenty miles wide, the central portion of the range\r\nis composed largely of red Late Paleozoic sediments like those exposed\r\nin the Garden of the Gods and Red Rocks Park. These rocks are\r\nintricately folded and faulted, but not metamorphosed. They include\r\nsandstones, shale, conglomerates, and fossil-bearing limestones. The\r\nnorthern end of the range is formed of Precambrian igneous and\r\nmetamorphic rocks.\r\n\r\nJust west of La Veta Pass, Sierra Blanca stands as an outpost of the\r\nrange where its continuity is interrupted and its structure changed.\r\nHuge blocks of Precambrian granite were here pushed upward and thrust\r\nwestward to form a cluster of peaks, several of which are over 14,000\r\nfeet in elevation.\r\n\r\nMany prominent rock glaciers are present in the Sangre de Cristo\r\nMountains. They are composed of fragments of rock, lubricated by snow\r\nand ice, creeping almost imperceptibly down the steep flanks of the high\r\npeaks. One of these rock glaciers can be seen on the slope of Mt. Mestas\r\neast of La Veta Pass; others are visible from Great Sand Dunes National\r\nMonument.\r\n\r\nSouth of La Veta Pass, an igneous intrusion along the axis of the range\r\nchanges the character of the Sangre de Cristos. This intrusion is harder\r\nand has weathered more slowly than the rest of the range, and forms a\r\ngroup of prominent peaks known as the Culebra Range.\r\n\r\nOn the west flank of the Sangre de Cristo Range, east of Villa Grove, a\r\nprominent iron-mineralized area can be seen. Here the ghost mine of\r\nOrient marks the site where iron ores were mined in the early days of\r\nthe Colorado Fuel and Iron Company. Nearby, an abrupt terrace along the\r\nedge of the valley marks the position of a fault. Recent gravels are\r\ninvolved in this fault, indicating that movement has taken place here\r\nwithin the last few hundred years. A number of hot springs occur along\r\nthe base of the mountains nearby.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Peaks, not structurally related to the Sangre de Cristos,\r\nare visible from La Veta Pass highway. These two peaks represent a pair\r\nof Cenozoic volcanoes, now deeply eroded and much reduced from their\r\nformer height. Numerous dikes radiating from the bases of these peaks\r\nrepresent fissures which were filled with lava as the peaks formed.\r\n\r\nThe Great Sand Dunes, close to the Sangre de Cristo Mountains north of\r\nSierra Blanca, are discussed in Chapter II in the section on the\r\nQuaternary Period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spanish Peaks, south of Colorado Springs and southwest of\r\nWalsenburg, are twin mountains of volcanic and intrusive rock, the roots\r\nof Tertiary volcanoes greatly worn down and reshaped by erosion. This\r\nview looks southeast from near La Veta Pass, on U.S. Highway 160. (Jack\r\nRathbone photo)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Park Range and Rabbit Ears Range\r\n\r\nBordering the western side of North, Middle, and South Parks, another\r\nlong north-south trending ridge extends from the Wyoming border toward\r\nthe center of Colorado. The northern part of this ridge, forming the\r\nwestern boundary of the main mountain mass in the state, is called the\r\nPark Range.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the Park Range is similar to that of the Front Range: a\r\nhuge linear corrugation in the earth’s crust, bounded by faults. Because\r\nthis area has fewer resistant sedimentary rock layers above the\r\nPrecambrian basement rocks, it is not prominently edged with upturned\r\nsedimentary layers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hahn’s Peak, a highly eroded laccolith of rhyolite\r\nporphyry, lies on the west side of the Park Range, along the eastern\r\nmargin of the Plateau Province. Placer gold was discovered here in 1865,\r\nbut the bedrock source of the gold was never found.

Mt. Zirkel (12,180 feet) and Flattop\r\nMountain (12,118 feet) are the two high points of the range; these and a\r\nnumber of unnamed peaks over 11,000 feet high are upward-faulted blocks\r\nof Precambrian granite.\r\n\r\nA rough ridge of volcanic country joins the Park Range with the Front\r\nRange and effectively separates North Park and Middle Park. This is the\r\nRabbit Ears Range, named for a double-eared knob of Precambrian granite\r\nnear Rabbit Ears Pass on U. S. highway 40. Many Tertiary volcanic\r\nfeatures, including dikes and lava flows, can be seen along this ridge,\r\nwhich is also traversed by Colorado state highway 125 between Granby and\r\nWalden via Willow Creek Pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Gore Range\r\n\r\nThe Gore Range lies south of Gore Pass, along the Park Range trend. The\r\nridge of this range is low for about 15 miles south of Kremmling, but\r\nthe southern part of the range forms a spectacular high cluster of peaks\r\nwith many relatively inaccessible and rugged summits. Many of the peaks\r\nin this remote country are as yet unnamed; the area has been set aside\r\nas the Gore Range-Eagle’s Nest Wilderness Area. The Colorado River cuts\r\ndirectly across the northern part of the Gore Range just west of\r\nKremmling, in a steep-walled canyon that is one of the wild scenic spots\r\nof Colorado.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The southern part of the Gore Range, viewed from the\r\neast, shows Precambrian granite and metamorphic rocks rising above\r\nCretaceous shale hills. The nearly horizontal crest of the range\r\nprobably represents the Precambrian erosion surface. (Jack Rathbone\r\nphoto)]\r\n\r\nThe Gore Range is, like the Front Range, a faulted anticline with\r\nPrecambrian rocks at its core. The red sedimentary rocks on the west\r\nflank of the range, visible at Vail Pass and Vail ski area, are of the\r\nsame age as those in Red Rocks Park near Denver and the Garden of the\r\nGods near Colorado Springs. Paleozoic rocks are absent on the east flank\r\nof the range, having been eroded from that area before Mesozoic\r\ndeposition. South of the Colorado River and north of the Wilderness\r\nArea, Mesozoic rocks extend over the crest of the range.\r\n\r\nThe south end of the Gore Range is marked by Tenmile Gorge (U. S.\r\nhighway 6 between Frisco and Vail Pass). This gorge is a glacial valley,\r\ncarved during the Ice Age by a glacier more than 1,000 feet thick, along\r\na weak faulted zone in the range. A fault surface can be seen on the\r\neast side of the valley.\r\n\r\nFrom Vail Pass, or from the top of the Vail ski lift, other evidences of\r\nglaciation can be seen—cirques and U-shaped valleys—testifying to the\r\nformer presence here of many large valley glaciers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Tenmile and Mosquito Ranges\r\n\r\nWith scarcely a break, the Park Range-Gore Range structure continues\r\nsouthward into the Tenmile and Mosquito Ranges. These high ridges\r\nseparate South Park from the upper Arkansas Valley, and include a\r\ncluster of very high peaks, Quandary, Mt. Lincoln, Mt. Democrat, and Mt.\r\nBross, all over 14,000 feet in elevation.\r\n\r\nStructurally, both the Tenmile Range and the Mosquito Range are highly\r\nasymmetrical anticlines, gentle on the east and steeply faulted on the\r\nwest. Paleozoic sedimentary rock layers containing many fossils cover\r\nlarge portions of the higher parts of these ranges, but two of the\r\nhighest peaks, Mt. Bross and Mt. Lincoln, are capped by the Lincoln\r\nPorphyry, a Tertiary intrusive, while Quandary Peak is Precambrian\r\ngranite.\r\n\r\nThese mountains are highly mineralized, and have been extensively\r\nexplored and mined. The Climax Molybdenum Corporation operates an\r\nespecially large mine at Climax, and the New Jersey Zinc Company has a\r\nlarge underground mine and mill at Gilman, on the western slopes of\r\nTenmile Range.\r\n\r\nBuffalo Peaks, two highly eroded volcanic mountains near the south end\r\nof Mosquito Range, are extrusions of lava and ash which have buried the\r\naxis of the Mosquito uplift. They are major volcanoes related to a group\r\nof small volcanic cones near Antero Junction, in South Park.\r\n\r\nSouth of Buffalo Peaks, near Trout Creek Pass, the Mosquito Range loses\r\naltitude rapidly and merges with the rough country called the Arkansas\r\nHills. Cinder cones, dikes, and other evidences of Tertiary volcanic\r\nactivity can be seen between Trout Creek Pass and Salida.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Sawatch Range\r\n\r\nBordering the Arkansas River valley on the west, the Sawatch Range\r\nincludes Colorado’s highest mountain, Mt. Elbert (14,417 feet). With\r\nseveral other 14,000-foot summits, this range is the highest in the\r\nstate. One group of peaks, known as the Collegiate Range (Mts. Harvard,\r\nYale, Columbia, and Princeton) forms a particularly imposing vista from\r\nU. S. highway 24 between Trout Creek Pass and Buena Vista. The\r\nIndependence Pass highway (Colorado 82) between Leadville and Aspen\r\npenetrates the heart of the Sawatch high country.\r\n\r\nThe Sawatch Range as a whole is about 100 miles long (north to south)\r\nand 40 miles wide. It is a great faulted anticline intruded by igneous\r\nrocks. The high area north of Leadville shows that the Sawatch and\r\nMosquito Ranges are in reality one huge dome with a slight sag in the\r\nmiddle. The ranges, though, are sharply separated topographically by the\r\ndeep valley of the Arkansas River. Precambrian rocks are near the\r\nsurface between the ranges, hidden only by a thin cover of stream\r\ngravels. Near Leadville, some complexly faulted Paleozoic limestones lie\r\nin the sag between the ranges.\r\n\r\nAt Mt. Princeton Hot Springs there is evidence of repeated faulting and\r\nigneous activity. The rocks are strongly altered by hot water coming to\r\nthe surface through fissures and cracks.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of the Sawatch range, the old mining towns of Tincup\r\nand Aspen grew up where limestone and sandstone layers, broken and\r\ncrumpled as the Sawatch Range rose, were mineralized by solutions rich\r\nin gold and silver. The Aspen Mining District was studied extensively by\r\ngeologists of the U.S. Geological Survey, and their maps show almost\r\nunbelievable complexity in the faulting of the rock layers which exist\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe north end of the Sawatch Range plunges under shales and sandstones\r\nalong the Eagle River east of Wolcott. Gypsum in the sediments here has\r\nacted like putty: the layers of rock in which it was deposited have\r\nbecome peculiarly crumpled, making the area along the Eagle River\r\n(visible from U. S. Interstate 70) between Avon and Edwards hummocky and\r\nirregular. Vegetation is unusually sparse here because of gypsum in the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nAbout midway between Edwards and Wolcott, the Eagle River suddenly\r\nchanges direction and flows northward for about a mile before resuming\r\nits former westward course. This sudden change is caused by a sharp\r\nnorth-south fold in the sedimentary rocks on the northwestern flank of\r\nthe Sawatch Range. A magnificent series of roadcut and hillside\r\nexposures along the highway here illustrates the close relation between\r\nrock layers and river course. Within about a mile, the highway cuts\r\nthrough rocks of Pennsylanian, Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, and\r\nCretaceous age, spanning a geologic time interval of more than 200\r\nmillion years.\r\n\r\nThe south end of the Sawatch Range, at Monarch Pass, contains steeply\r\ndipping Late Paleozoic limestones and coal beds. The coal has been mined\r\non a small scale; the limestone is now quarried for use as a flux in\r\niron smelters at Pueblo.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: The area below the Aspen Mountain ski lift is highly\r\n     complex geologically. It is particularly well known because of\r\n       extensive prospecting and mining activity in the region.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Elk Mountains and West Elk Mountains\r\n\r\nThe Elk Mountains and West Elk Mountains appear to be westward\r\ncontinuations of the Sawatch Range. Structurally, however, they are not\r\nfaulted anticlines like most of the other ranges in Colorado, but are\r\ncomposed of a series of layers of Paleozoic sediments thrust westward\r\nover one another. These rocks, often crumpled and highly metamorphosed,\r\nare cut by numerous sills, dikes, and other intrusions, many of which\r\nhave caused mineral enrichment locally.\r\n\r\nAt Maroon Bells, in the canyon of Maroon Creek, and at Redstone on the\r\nCrystal River, these metamorphosed sediments are well exposed. Here, red\r\nsandstones and shales have been altered to quartzites and slate. At\r\nMarble, metamorphism of a thick limestone bed has produced white marble\r\nof great beauty, known as Yule Marble. This decorative stone was\r\nquarried extensively until about 1940. It was used in the Lincoln\r\nMemorial and several other monumental structures; in the town of Marble\r\nit has been used for the doorsteps of log cabins! The largest block\r\nquarried, for the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National\r\nCemetery, measured 14 by 7.4 by 6 feet in the rough, and weighed 56\r\ntons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mt. Sopris, south of Glenwood Springs, is an igneous\r\nintrusion. (Jack Rathbone photo)]\r\n\r\nCrested Butte, at the south end of the Elk Mountains, is a small\r\nintrusive igneous mass called a _laccolith_. Hard and resistant to\r\nerosion, it stands over 2,000 feet above the adjacent valley floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           San Juan Mountains\r\n\r\nThe San Juan Mountains are the most extensive range in Colorado, and\r\nalso the most heterogeneous. Covering more than 10,000 square miles of\r\nthe southwestern part of the state, these mountains are formed mostly of\r\nTertiary volcanic rocks, the result of repeated outpourings of lava and\r\nash from a cluster of volcanoes. Water-laid gravels composed of volcanic\r\nsand and pebbles are interlayered with basalts and ash beds; the total\r\nthickness of these beds reaches many thousands of feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The mining town of Ouray, now also a tourist haven and\r\nsummer resort, nestles below Pennsylvanian sedimentary rocks of Ouray\r\nCanyon. At the north end at town can be seen the Ouray Hot Springs\r\nswimming pool. Gold, silver, lead, and zinc are still mined in this\r\narea. (Jack Rathbone photo)]\r\n\r\nThe widespread volcanic activity which formed most of the range began in\r\nmid-Tertiary time and continued for several million years. A few\r\nQuaternary volcanic flows are known in the region, but there is no\r\nactive volcanism there at present.\r\n\r\nThe western side of the main range, including some of the highest peaks,\r\nconsists primarily of uplifted and faulted Paleozoic sedimentary layers.\r\nThese layers, highly dissected by erosion, can be seen near Ouray, at\r\nMolas Lake, and at Durango. Large patches of Precambrian granite and\r\nmetamorphic rocks protrude through the sediments, as in the Needle\r\nMountains; they indicate that this part of the range is a faulted\r\nanticline like many other Colorado ranges.\r\n\r\nEarly Cenozoic glacial deposits occur in some parts of the San Juans.\r\nThese are unusual features, as glaciation of this age is unknown\r\nelsewhere in Colorado.\r\n\r\nThree small ranges rise just west of the San Juans: the San Miguel,\r\nRico, and La Plata Mountains. Each consists of several small masses of\r\nTertiary igneous rock intruded into Paleozoic conglomerates, shales, and\r\nlimestones.\r\n\r\nMineralization has been intense in the San Juans; most of it took place\r\nduring the Late Tertiary volcanic period. Rich veins penetrate\r\nPrecambrian gneiss and granite, and Paleozoic limestones are often\r\nenriched also. Several mines are still active near Ouray, Silverton,\r\nTelluride, and Rico.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Uinta Mountains\r\n\r\nThe eastern end of Utah’s Uinta Mountains extends into Colorado. Unlike\r\nother ranges in Colorado, these mountains trend east-west. Structurally,\r\nthe range is a faulted anticline. It is quite asymmetrical, however, and\r\nis tilted and folded upward on the south, and overturned or\r\nthrust-faulted on the north. Steeply dipping Mesozoic and Paleozoic\r\nsediments on the south side of the range, sparsely vegetated and often\r\nthrown into spectacular folds, are a prominent feature of northwest\r\nColorado scenery.\r\n\r\nIn Colorado the crest of the Uintas reaches an elevation of about 8,500\r\nfeet. It consists of Precambrian rocks, but these are not the igneous\r\nand metamorphic rocks that characterize the Precambrian core of other\r\nColorado mountains. They are easily recognized as sediments—dark red\r\nconglomerates, sandstones, and mudstones—virtually unmetamorphosed\r\nthough they were deposited nearly a billion years ago. Called the Uinta\r\nMountain Formation, these rocks are found only in this part of Colorado\r\nand adjacent areas of Utah. They are probably related to similar\r\nPrecambrian rocks found in Montana and Canada.\r\n\r\nAt the east end of the Uintas two isolated uplifts, Cross Mountain and\r\nJuniper Mountain, are faulted blocks of Paleozoic rocks standing like\r\nislands in a sea of Cenozoic valley fill. They are the last outposts of\r\nthe Uinta anticlinal pattern as it wanes toward the southeast.\r\n\r\nDinosaur National Monument, a Uinta Mountain tourist attraction,\r\nencompasses a vast area of wilderness on both sides of the Yampa River\r\nin Colorado. Here many of the features of the east end of the Uinta\r\nMountain structure can be seen. A unique display of the world’s largest\r\nfossils can be visited in the Utah portion of the Monument.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: At their confluence in Dinosaur National Monument, the\r\nYampa and Green Rivers have carved Late Paleozoic sandstone into the\r\nprecipitous cliffs of Steamboat Rock. (William C. Bradley photo)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE PLATEAUS\r\n\r\nThe western quarter of Colorado is a region of flat-lying Paleozoic,\r\nMesozoic, and Cenozoic sedimentary rocks which have not been bent up\r\ninto mountains except in a few isolated instances. This area lies more\r\nthan a mile above sea level, however, and because of the gradient such\r\nan elevation affords, it is deeply sculptured. The Colorado River and\r\nits tributaries have sliced into the plateau surface, separating it into\r\nmany isolated tablelands or mesas. Some are capped with sedimentary\r\nrock, others with Tertiary basalt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Grand Hogback is a good example of the type of\r\ngeologic structure known as a _monocline_. The hogback ridge is formed\r\nby differential erosion, where soft layers wear away more easily than\r\nhard layers.]\r\n\r\nSimple folds and faults have given the mesas different elevations. Thus\r\nthe average elevation of the White River Plateau is 11,000 feet, that of\r\nthe Roan Plateau 9,500 feet, and that of Mesa Verde only 7,000 feet.\r\nWest of Durango the plateaus dip gently southward, as can be seen at\r\nMesa Verde. Igneous intrusions and extrusions have altered plateau\r\ntopography in some areas. West of Mesa Verde, for instance, an intrusive\r\nstock forms a prominent dome in the Southern Ute Indian Reservation.\r\n\r\nWest of the northern Colorado mountains, and north and west of the White\r\nRiver Plateau, a rolling upland extends from Colorado into Utah and\r\nWyoming. It is interrupted by the Uinta Mountains and a number of\r\nsmaller related uplifts such as Juniper Mountain and Cross Mountain.\r\nSouth of the Uinta axis the area is known as the Uinta Basin.\r\n\r\nThe northern part of this area is structurally the south edge of the\r\nGreen River or Washakie Basin in Wyoming. The Rangely anticline, in the\r\nnortheastern corner of the Uinta Basin, is one of Colorado’s richest oil\r\nfields; it is discussed in Chapter III.\r\n\r\nAlthough surfaced with much younger sediments than the rest of the\r\nPlateau Province, this area is structurally similar. On the whole,\r\nsedimentary layers are relatively flat-lying, and where they are\r\nuplifted they are deeply sculptured by streams and rivers. The\r\nsedimentary rocks in this region contain uranium and placer gold in\r\naddition to great oil and gas deposits. The southeastern part of the\r\nUinta Basin, usually called the Piceance Basin, is the site of a great\r\ndeposit of oil shale (see Chapter III). The term “basin” may here seem\r\nunusual to the casual observer, for the oil shales occur on the Roan\r\nPlateau at places well over 10,000 feet in elevation. However, the\r\nentire region was basin-like—lower than the surrounding ranges—for many\r\nmillions of years, and during Tertiary time thousands of feet of valley\r\nand lake deposits were laid down in it.\r\n\r\nThe White River Plateau, north of Glenwood Springs, is composed of\r\nalmost horizontal Paleozoic sedimentary rocks that fold downward sharply\r\nalong its south and west edges. The fold is 135 miles long and is\r\nclearly marked by the Grand Hogback, the eroded edge of hard Cretaceous\r\nand early Cenozoic rock layers. Shale and coaly layers involved in the\r\nsame fold have eroded more readily, leaving the resistant sandstone as a\r\nprominent ridge.\r\n\r\nThe Uncompahgre Plateau, southwest of Grand Junction, is structurally\r\nvery like the White River Plateau. Its features can be well observed in\r\nColorado National Monument. It has been elevated several thousand feet\r\nmore than the Book Cliffs and Grand Valley areas to the north. Sharp\r\nfolding and faulting near the Colorado River at the north boundary of\r\nthe National Monument show that differential movement between the two\r\nregions was sharp and localized.\r\n\r\nA series of northwest-trending anticlines along the Utah border in\r\nsouthwestern Colorado are of special geologic interest. They represent\r\npeculiar structures in which salt and gypsum have played a major part.\r\nThese minerals were deposited in thick layers late in Paleozoic time;\r\nsubsequently they were covered by thousands of feet of sand, shale, and\r\nlimestone. Because of their low density and high plasticity they have\r\nsince crept upward along weak spots in the overlying sediments, often\r\ncontorting these rocks as they moved. Breaking through to the surface,\r\nthe salt and some of the gypsum washed away more rapidly than the\r\nsurrounding rock, leaving long faulted troughs such as Gypsum Valley and\r\nParadox Valley. In most of these structures the gypsum can still be\r\nseen, although the more soluble salt has eroded away. Oil wells in this\r\npart of Colorado and in adjacent parts of southeast Utah have penetrated\r\nthousands of feet of evaporites, including pure salt, gypsum, and\r\npotassium salts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In the arid climate of the Colorado Plateaus, ledges of\r\nwell-cemented sandstone stand out sharply from slopes of shale or\r\nmudstone. The Mesa Verde and Mancos Formations, Cretaceous in age, form\r\nthe slopes and top of Mt. Garfield near Grand Junction (Jack Rathbone\r\nphoto)]\r\n\r\nThe peculiar weathering characteristics of flat-lying sedimentary rocks\r\nin an arid climate are well demonstrated in Colorado National Monument,\r\nMesa Verde National Park, and elsewhere in the Plateau Province. Those\r\nfortunate enough to make a river trip through the Yampa or Green River\r\nCanyons in northwestern Colorado or on the rivers of eastern Utah and\r\nnorthern Arizona will have an unusually fine opportunity to observe\r\nclose at hand the weathering and erosion in this area. Resistant\r\nsandstone and limestone layers break into sheer cliffs, often many\r\nhundreds of feet high, while the softer layers of mudstone and shale\r\nform gentle slopes and terraces. Vast arching caves often develop where\r\nresistant layers are undermined—caves sometimes containing ancient\r\nIndian dwellings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n                      Geologic History of Colorado\r\n\r\n\r\nAstronomical and geologic evidence indicates that the earth was probably\r\nformed as an immense blob of molten rock, held together and shaped into\r\nspherical form by its own gravity. It may even have been gaseous at\r\nfirst, cooling gradually to a molten state. After hundreds of millions\r\nof years it became cool enough to begin to harden.\r\n\r\nAs the surface cooled, a crust formed, and lay like a blanket over the\r\nliquid mass beneath. Convection currents—large-scale boiling\r\nmovements—stirred the molten interior, thrust portions of the crust\r\nupward, and sucked other portions downward to be remelted. Some of the\r\nlighter components, such as compounds of silicon and oxygen and\r\nhydrogen, accumulated on the surface like froth on a kettle: the\r\ncontinents were born. With further cooling the atmosphere and oceans\r\ncame into being.\r\n\r\nSomething can be told of the age of the continents. Measurements of\r\nradioactivity in the most ancient rocks exposed at the surface today\r\nindicate that the oldest known continental rock is between three and\r\nfour billion years old. Since the continents were formed, they have been\r\nbent and shifted and broken by the pressures exerted against them by\r\nconvection in the interior. Parts of the continents at times have been\r\nsubmerged below the level of the sea, even as they are today. Other\r\nportions, lifted above sea level, were immediately attacked by the\r\nwearing-down processes of erosion. The battle between mountain-building\r\nforces and erosion has been a continuous one ever since the crust was\r\nformed. Even now earthquakes give testimony to continued crustal\r\nmovement, storms still sweep across the continents and wash mud and\r\nfrost-loosened rocks into churning torrents, rivers still deposit great\r\nfloodplains and deltas, sediments accumulate slowly but persistently\r\nupon the bottoms of the seas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            PRECAMBRIAN ERA\r\n\r\nOnly part of the earth’s very early history is represented in Colorado,\r\nwhere the oldest known rocks are the gneisses and schists of the Idaho\r\nSprings Formation, at least 1,800,000,000 years old. These rocks appear\r\nto be the remains of ancient sediments, folded and metamorphosed into\r\nvast mountain areas long before recognizable life inhabited the earth.\r\n\r\nPrecambrian rocks in Colorado are on the whole very poorly known. They\r\nhave, however, been studied in detail in the Front Range west of Denver\r\nand Boulder, where they have been intensively explored for valuable\r\nminerals. The lack of fossils in the oldest rocks makes their close\r\ncorrelation difficult, but from studies of radioactive minerals\r\ncontained in these rocks, and of the relationships of the rock units\r\nthemselves, we can list them in order of their relative ages.\r\n\r\nNote that the rock sequence given below reads chronologically from\r\nbottom to top—a logical pattern in geology since younger rocks,\r\nespecially those of sedimentary origin, normally lie above older ones.\r\nRecent studies indicate that the sequence may be much more complex than\r\nshown here.\r\n\r\n   (youngest) Silver Plume Granite:  light pinkish gray, fine-grained\r\n                                     granite.\r\n                Pikes Peak Granite:  pink, coarse-grained granite.\r\n             Boulder Creek Granite:  dark gray, faintly banded\r\n                                     granodiorite.\r\n              Coal Creek Quartzite:  light gray quartzite with grains\r\n                                     ranging in size from fine sand to\r\n                                     boulders, with some interbedded\r\n                                     schist.\r\n        Swandyke Hornblende Gneiss:  dark gray to black, strongly banded\r\n                                     gneiss.\r\n  (oldest) Idaho Springs Formation:  gray to black schist and gneiss.\r\n\r\nFrom a sequence such as this, it is possible to reconstruct some\r\nfeatures of Colorado’s early history. The first chapter of which we have\r\na record is the deposition of the Idaho Springs Formation, probably as\r\nan accumulation of mud, sand, and limy mud in an ancient sea. Swandyke\r\ndeposition followed—the sediments were iron-rich, perhaps derived from\r\nancient volcanic materials. The original Coal Creek sediments were sands\r\nand gravels, some of them quite coarse and therefore indicative of\r\nnear-shore deposition. The schist layers suggest that muds must have\r\nbeen deposited also.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: South of Ouray, Cambrian sandstones of the Sawatch\r\nFormation lie almost horizontally across the vertical Precambrian\r\nmetamorphic rocks. (Jack Rathbone photo)]\r\n\r\nTogether these three formations represent some 40,000 feet of\r\nsedimentary layers. Deposition of such a great thickness of mud, sand,\r\nand lime must have taken a very long period of time. Details of the\r\ngeography of the continent during that period have of course been\r\nobscured by later events, when these rocks were subjected to repeated\r\nuplift, crumpling, folding, various degrees of remelting and\r\nrecrystallization, and erosion. But the ancient sediments must have been\r\nderived from even more ancient highlands, either folded and faulted\r\nmountains or volcanoes, and probably were deposited under water in broad\r\nexpanses of sea that covered portions of the continent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Geologic map of Colorado. Geologic maps show the age of\r\nrocks appearing at the surface, disregarding soil cover. A more detailed\r\ngeologic map of Colorado may be obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey\r\nat the Federal Center in Denver.]\r\n\r\n  PRECAMBRIAN\r\n  PALEOZOIC\r\n  MESOZOIC\r\n  CENOZOIC SEDIMENTS\r\n  CENOZOIC VOLCANICS\r\n    Yampa River\r\n    White River\r\n    Fort Collins\r\n    South Platte River\r\n    Glenwood Springs\r\n    Denver\r\n    Colorado River\r\n    Grand Junction\r\n    Aspen\r\n    Gunnison River\r\n    Colorado Springs\r\n    Gunnison\r\n    Salida\r\n    Dolores River\r\n    Rio Grande\r\n    Arkansas River\r\n    La Junta\r\n    Walsenburg\r\n    Alamosa\r\n    Durango\r\n\r\nThe Boulder Creek, Pikes Peak, and Silver Plume Granites cut through the\r\nmetamorphic rocks, and are therefore younger. They represent pulses of\r\nmolten rock forced upward from deep within the crust, probably during\r\nthree separate episodes of mountain building. As each set of mountains\r\nwas formed, it was worn down, perhaps to low rolling hills, perhaps to\r\nflat plains almost at sea level, and partially or entirely covered with\r\nthick layers of sediment. Each time, another mountain building episode\r\nfollowed, with new intrusions of granite and new metamorphism of the\r\npre-existing rocks.\r\n\r\nEach succeeding period of metamorphism and mountain building further\r\nchanged the nature of the rocks involved, complicating the patterns of\r\nfolding and faulting, adding recrystallization to recrystallization,\r\nuntil the oldest of the rocks bore little trace of their original\r\nsedimentary nature. In general, the rocks that are oldest were most\r\naltered by the repeated metamorphism, while the younger rocks were less\r\naltered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Black Canyon of the Gunnison River is one of the\r\nstate’s deep and spectacular chasms. Canyon walls are of Precambrian\r\ngneiss intruded by many dikes and highly fractured by later uplifts. The\r\nflat upper surface of the Precambrian rocks represents an ancient plain\r\non which, during Jurassic time, the dinosaur-bearing Morrison Formation\r\nwas deposited. (John Chronic photo)]\r\n\r\nThe Precambrian Era ended with a long period of erosion, a period known\r\nto geologists as the Lipalian Interval. During this time, over almost\r\nthe entire world there was no mountain building. The land lay sleeping,\r\nsubject only to the forces of erosion. The last mountains were flattened\r\nnearly to sea level. Slow, sluggish streams and rivers carried sand and\r\nmud toward the oceans—oceans in which perhaps primitive, soft-bodied\r\norganisms, with no hard parts to be preserved as fossils, were beginning\r\nto evolve.\r\n\r\nOn the continents, the time of intense metamorphism was over; most rocks\r\nof later eras are preserved today in pretty much their original state.\r\nThe boundary between the Precambrian and later rocks is normally well\r\ndefined. It is visible at many places in Colorado: in Williams Canyon\r\nnear Colorado Springs, in Glenwood Canyon, near Red Rocks west of\r\nDenver, just west of La Veta Pass, at the top of Royal Gorge and the\r\nBlack Canyon of the Gunnison. At most of these localities it is a\r\nsmoothly beveled surface, with highly contorted Precambrian rocks below\r\nit and flat-lying Paleozoic sediments above it. Near Red Rocks and La\r\nVeta Pass, the same relationship prevails, but the entire contact, and\r\nthe rocks above and below it, have been steeply tilted by the uplift of\r\nthe present mountains.\r\n\r\nIn portions of western North America, deposition late in Precambrian\r\ntime has left a series of flat-lying rocks between the contorted\r\nPrecambrian and later Paleozoic sediments. These rocks can be seen in\r\nnorthwestern Colorado, where they form the dark red sedimentary core of\r\nthe Uinta Mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PALEOZOIC ERA\r\n\r\nGeologists have divided the second great era of geologic time into units\r\ncalled Periods. The rocks deposited during a Period are called Systems,\r\nbut more often than not it is convenient to discuss them in terms of\r\neasily recognized units of rock, called Formations. Formations are named\r\nafter areas in which they are well exposed.\r\n\r\nThe stratigraphic column given in Chapter I shows the Periods and\r\nSystems in their correct order, and gives the age in years for each, as\r\ndetermined by radioactivity methods. As you read, refer as often as\r\nnecessary to this column.\r\n\r\nThe geologic map on page 35 will help you locate areas where the rocks\r\ndiscussed in the text are exposed, and will greatly facilitate your\r\nunderstanding of the geology of the state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Cambrian Sawatch Sandstone lies almost horizontally\r\non Precambrian granite in Glenwood Canyon. In the foreground is the\r\nColorado River. (Jack Rathbone photo)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Cambrian Period\r\n                      (500-570 million years ago)\r\n\r\nThe first fossiliferous rocks in Colorado were deposited during the\r\nCambrian Period, at a time when over much of the world the seas were\r\ncreeping in across wide, level plains formed during the Lipalian\r\nInterval. Colorado was not covered by these seas until quite late in the\r\nCambrian Period. Beach deposits progressively younger in age suggest\r\nthat the sea invaded from the west, and spread slowly eastward,\r\ninundating most of the central part of the state but not the extreme\r\nnorth or south.\r\n\r\nThe beach deposits, now called the Sawatch Sandstone because they are\r\nwell exposed in the Sawatch Range, are composed mostly of fine quartz\r\nsand. They are colored with glauconite, a green mineral, and hematite, a\r\ndark red mineral, so that the rock has a variegated appearance. The post\r\noffice at Manitou is built of this red and green rock, and good\r\nexposures of it exist in Williams Canyon near Manitou, along U. S.\r\nHighway 24 northwest of Manitou, near Red Cliff and Minturn, and in\r\nGlenwood Canyon.\r\n\r\nThe sea which crept over Colorado at this time contained small\r\nconical-shelled mollusks, brachiopods, and trilobites. Their shells can\r\noccasionally be found in Cambrian rocks in Williams Canyon and in the\r\nSawatch and Mosquito Ranges. At two localities unusual fossils called\r\ngraptolites have been found in thin Upper Cambrian shales overlying the\r\nSawatch Sandstone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: These fossils can occasionally be found in Cambrian rocks\r\nin central Colorado.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Ordovician Period\r\n                      (440-500 million years ago)\r\n\r\nThe sea deepened and widened as the Ordovician Period began, and a\r\nseries of limestones and dolomites was deposited, either on top of the\r\nSawatch Sandstone or, where the Sawatch had not been deposited, directly\r\non the Precambrian. These rocks are now called the Manitou Formation.\r\n\r\nThe fossils in these rocks are much more varied than those in the\r\nSawatch Sandstone: snails, echinoderms, sponges, cephalopods,\r\nbrachiopods, and trilobites are common. The Ordovician sea must have\r\nteemed with life, as many rocks deposited at this time are more than\r\nhalf composed of animal remains. In addition to hard-shelled animals\r\nwhich formed fossils, there were probably abundant soft-bodied animals\r\nsuch as jellyfish and worms, which left no record of their presence.\r\n\r\nAfter deposition of the Manitou Formation, the seas receded slightly. A\r\nnew series of sands was deposited above the Manitou in central Colorado.\r\nThese now form the Harding Sandstone, a formation of unusual interest\r\nbecause it contains remains of the earth’s earliest known vertebrates,\r\nprimitive jawless fish called Agnathids. In places in the Harding\r\nSandstone there are dense accumulations of the tiny polygonal armor\r\nplates from these fish. Although no whole fish have been found, we can\r\nreconstruct their appearance by comparing individual plates or groups of\r\nplates with later, better known relatives.\r\n\r\nAlso present in great quantities in the Harding Sandstone are conodonts,\r\npeculiar tiny brown tooth-like fossils. Relationships of the conodonts\r\nare unknown; they may be parts of the Agnathids, or perhaps they\r\nrepresent some entirely different group of animals, with no living\r\nrelatives.\r\n\r\nAfter deposition of the sands of the Harding Sandstone, the sea deepened\r\nlocally and the Fremont Limestone, a massive gray crystalline limestone\r\ncontaining many marine fossils, was deposited. Mollusks (some quite\r\nlarge), brachiopods, and corals contributed their shells to the Fremont\r\nLimestone. The chain coral _Catenipora_ and the horn coral\r\n_Streptelasma_ may often be used to identify the formation.\r\n\r\nThe Fremont Limestone was deposited very late in the Ordovician Period.\r\nProbably the seas were much more extensive then than present deposits\r\nindicate; subsequent erosion has at several times erased the evidence in\r\nuplifted areas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: These Ordovician fossils can be found in the Manitou\r\nFormation in the Colorado Springs area.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The earliest known fish remains come from the Ordovician\r\nHarding Sandstone of central Colorado. These fragments of the protective\r\nplates have been magnified about five times.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Corals and coral-like organisms occur in the Ordovician\r\nFremont Limestone.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Silurian Period\r\n                      (400-440 million years ago)\r\n\r\nUntil very recently, no Silurian rocks or fossils were known in\r\nColorado, and it was thought that seas did not extend into the state\r\nduring this period. However, a few years ago good Silurian corals and\r\nbrachiopods were discovered near the northern edge of the state. They\r\noccur in broken blocks and patches of Silurian limestone, mingled with\r\nblocks of other sedimentary rocks and, oddly enough, with volcanic\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nWhat seems to have happened here is that sedimentary layers of Silurian\r\nage _were_ present over northern Colorado at one time. During some\r\nsubsequent period of volcanism, volcanic lavas penetrated these\r\nsediments from below. Near the volcanic tubes, broken, angular fragments\r\nof the surrounding sedimentary rocks were sometimes carried upward or\r\ndownward by the motion of the lava.\r\n\r\nMuch later, both the volcanic outpourings (if the lavas ever reached the\r\nsurface) and the sediments were stripped away by erosion, probably at a\r\ntime when mountains were rising in the area. Only the deep portions of\r\nthe tubes that fed the volcanoes were preserved. These tubes are called\r\ndiatremes, and thanks to the blocks of sedimentary rock in them we know\r\nthat there were indeed seas in Colorado during Silurian time, seas\r\ncontaining the abundant life of a shallow marine environment very much\r\nlike that existing at the same time in Illinois, Iowa, and Indiana.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Devonian Period\r\n                      (350-400 million years ago)\r\n\r\nAs far as we know now, Colorado was just a little above sea level during\r\nmost of Devonian time. Early and Middle Devonian deposits are lacking.\r\nLate in the period, however, Colorado was widely inundated once more.\r\nEmbayments of a western sea covered most of the central part of the\r\nstate and an area in southwestern Colorado around Ouray.\r\n\r\nDeposits formed in these embayments have been given several names.\r\nChaffee Formation is the name most commonly used in central Colorado;\r\nOuray Formation identifies rocks of the same age in southwest Colorado.\r\nThe Chaffee Formation has been subdivided into two well defined units,\r\nthe Parting Sandstone or Quartzite, and the Dyer Dolomite or Limestone.\r\nMany ore deposits are associated with these rock units—notably deposits\r\nof lead and zinc. The Parting Sandstone is frequently so well cemented\r\nwith silica that it is actually a quartzite; thin shale beds or\r\n“partings” make it easy to recognize. It frequently contains remains of\r\nfossil fish and distinctive beds of algae.\r\n\r\nThe Dyer Dolomite contains brachiopods and bryozoans, mollusks and\r\ncorals. Some of the best fossil hunting in Colorado is in Dyer beds\r\naround the White River Plateau, where the fossils frequently weather out\r\nof the rock as almost perfect specimens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: These Devonian brachiopods come from the White River\r\nPlateau in western Colorado.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Mississippian Period\r\n                      (310-350 million years ago)\r\n\r\nThe sea continued to cover most of Colorado after the end of the\r\nDevonian Period, well into Mississippian time. Mississippian rocks are\r\ncharacteristically thick, massive gray limestones collectively called\r\nthe Leadville Limestone. This unit is well known as the host rock for\r\nmany Colorado ore deposits, notably those around the town of Leadville.\r\n\r\nDuring Mississippian time the western sea, warm and rich in organisms,\r\ncovered much of North America. Brachiopods and corals flourished, as did\r\nmany other forms of life. The seas during part of this time extended\r\ncompletely across Colorado to merge with seas that covered the\r\nmidwestern part of the United States.\r\n\r\nOver all this vast area, as well as southwest into Arizona, the gray,\r\nmassive, fossiliferous Mississippian limestone is remarkably uniform and\r\neasily recognized, although it is called by different names in different\r\nareas.\r\n\r\nLate in Mississippian time, the Colorado area rose slightly and the sea\r\nin which the Leadville Limestone was deposited receded. An interval of\r\nerosion followed. The surface of the limestone was dissolved and pitted,\r\ntunnels and caves formed where running water etched deep into the rock,\r\nand a reddish soil formed on the surface and in the hollows. This\r\nportion of the limestone, which in some places also contains pebbles of\r\nchert, is named the Molas Formation. Part of the Molas may be\r\nPennsylvanian in age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mississippian fossils from western Colorado show that\r\nseas covered much of the state about 330 million years ago.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Pennsylvanian Period\r\n                      (270-310 million years ago)\r\n\r\nAs the Pennsylvanian Period began, the Colorado area continued to rise.\r\nEarliest deposits of this age are fine-grained black shales and\r\nsands—the Glen Eyrie Formation along the southern Front Range and the\r\nBelden Formation in west central Colorado. Then, through millions of\r\nyears, mountain-building took place. Some areas rose more than others,\r\nso that formerly flat-lying marine sediments were bent and broken, and a\r\nseries of high mountain ridges and deep basins were formed. Geologists\r\nsometimes call these the Ancestral Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nAlthough the pattern of the mountains changed repeatedly, the Ancestral\r\nRockies consisted principally of two large ranges. One range roughly\r\nparalleled the present Front Range, but lay thirty to fifty miles\r\nfurther west. The other extended from the San Luis Valley northwest\r\ntoward Colorado National Monument, including the area around the Black\r\nCanyon of the Gunnison and the present Uncompahgre Plateau. Coarse\r\nsediments washed off both sides of both ranges, and accumulated as\r\nalluvial fans and valley fill along the mountain margins. These exist\r\ntoday as the Fountain Formation of the eastern Front Range, the Minturn\r\nFormation between the ancient uplifts, and the Hermosa Formation west of\r\nthe western uplift.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This paleogeographic map reflects the distribution of\r\nland and sea during the early part of the Pennsylvanian Period and shows\r\nwhere coarse sediments derived from the Ancestral Rockies were\r\ndeposited.]\r\n\r\n  FOUNTAIN FORMATION\r\n  MINTURN FORMATION\r\n  HERMOSA FORMATION\r\n\r\n[Illustration: West of Denver, the main line of the Denver & Rio Grande\r\nRailroad tunnels beneath steeply dipping sandstones and conglomerates of\r\nthe Fountain Formation. (Jack Rathbone photo)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Corals, brachiopods, and fusulinid Foraminifurida can be\r\nfound in the Pennsylvanian Minturn Formation at many places in the\r\nMountain and Plateau Provinces.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In western Colorado, where vegetation is sparse, rock\r\nstructures are clearly defined. This photograph shows beds of the\r\nPennsylvanian Minturn Formation sharply folded, probably as a result of\r\nthe deformation of gypsum in underlying layers. (Jack Rathbone photo)]\r\n\r\nIn the Flatirons near Boulder, Red Rocks Park near Denver, and the\r\nGarden of the Gods near Colorado Springs we see well exposed examples of\r\nthe Fountain Formation. The Minturn Formation is visible along the Eagle\r\nRiver west of Wolcott, and along Gore Creek near Vail. The Hermosa\r\nFormation forms striking red cliffs north of Durango. In the Sangre de\r\nCristo Mountains area, exceptionally great and rapid deposition took\r\nplace, and the Minturn Formation is very thick.\r\n\r\nIn west central Colorado, near the towns of Eagle and Gypsum, a large\r\nbasin formed. In it, gypsum and other salts were deposited as arms of\r\nthe sea were cut off from the main marine area. The unusual appearance\r\nof the hills along the Eagle River, especially north of U. S. Highway\r\n24, is caused by the presence of gypsum in the bedrock.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner, the Paradox Basin was formed in southwestern\r\nColorado. Thousands of feet of gypsum, salt, and potash were deposited\r\nhere, probably also precipitated in restricted arms of the sea. These\r\nminerals, the so-called evaporites, have since significantly controlled\r\ndevelopment of the landscape in Gypsum Valley and other parts of this\r\nregion. (See The Plateaus in Chapter I and the section on Gypsum in\r\nChapter III).\r\n\r\nBetween the mountain masses and their surrounding alluvial deposits,\r\nshallow seas repeatedly invaded the lowland areas of the state. Marine\r\nfossils in some parts of the Minturn Formation bear witness to as many\r\nas twenty marine cycles. Strangely, the Pennsylvanian Period appears to\r\nhave been cyclical in other parts of the United States as well, for\r\nmarine sediments are found alternating with nonmarine sediments in\r\nPennsylvania, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, and New Mexico. In middle\r\nPennsylvanian time, general uplift occurred in Colorado, and almost the\r\nentire state was above sea level for the rest of the period.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Permian Period\r\n                      (223-270 million years ago)\r\n\r\nBy the end of the Pennsylvanian Period, the mountains of the Ancestral\r\nRockies had been almost entirely removed by erosion, and the deep basins\r\nwere filled with sediments. Colorado was once more a great plain,\r\nsloping gently to the northeast. In eastern Colorado, a shallow sea\r\ngradually dried up, leaving some thin limestone and gypsum beds along\r\nits margin. The western shore of this sea was edged with beaches and\r\nsand dunes, preserved as the Lyons Sandstone. The buildings of the\r\nUniversity of Colorado, as well as many homes and other structures in\r\nthe Boulder-Denver area, are faced with this beautiful salmon-colored\r\nsandstone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Balanced Rock, in the Garden of the Gods northwest of\r\nColorado Springs, is an erosional remnant of iron-rich conglomerate and\r\nsandstone. It remains while the rest of the surrounding layers are gone\r\nbecause it is harder and more completely cemented together by silica.\r\nThe rock is part of the Late Paleozoic Fountain Formation. (John Chronic\r\nphoto)]\r\n\r\nIn the western part of the state, Permian deposits consist mostly of\r\nshales and sandstones. The red color of these rocks, and the complete\r\nabsence of fossils in them, suggest that the environment in which they\r\nwere deposited was not marine, but was a vast, level mudflat subject to\r\nalternating wet and dry periods. The shales and sandstones collectively\r\nare called the Maroon Formation, named for Maroon Bells, near Aspen,\r\nwhere they are dramatically exposed in the mountain cliffs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tracks of Permian reptiles called _Laoporus\r\ncoloradoensis_ occur in the Lyons Sandstone near Lyons. These are about\r\nlife size.]\r\n\r\nDuring part of Permian time, a shallow sea extended from Idaho, Utah,\r\nand Wyoming into the northwest corner of Colorado. In this sea was\r\ndeposited the Phosphoria Formation, a highly phosphatic limestone\r\ncontaining only rare, poorly preserved molluscan fossils.\r\n\r\nAs the Paleozoic Era ended, Colorado was still flat and low-lying. By\r\nthis time land plants and animals had evolved, but if vegetation grew in\r\nthe Colorado area, or animals roamed it, they left few fossil remains.\r\nTracks of early reptiles have been found in the Lyons Sandstone. Dune\r\nsandstones here and in adjacent areas suggest that desert conditions may\r\nhave prevailed, in which case Colorado would have been very similar,\r\nscenically and climatically, to Sahara regions today.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dark red Pennsylvanian and Permian conglomerates form the\r\nFlatirons that overlook the University of Colorado campus at Boulder.\r\nUniversity buildings are faced with Permian Lyons Sandstone quarried\r\nalong the foothills of the northern Front Range. (University of Colorado\r\nphoto)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              MESOZOIC ERA\r\n\r\nThe Mesozoic Era, popularly known as the Age of Reptiles or Age of\r\nDinosaurs, is divided into three periods. The climate of the entire\r\nearth appears to have been warmer then than it is at present, perhaps\r\nbecause of a different distribution of land and sea areas, or because\r\ncontinental areas were not as high and mountainous as they are just now.\r\nColorado was a rather low land area for most of the first two Mesozoic\r\nperiods; then a vast sea covered the entire state for the remainder of\r\nthe era.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The pink cliffs of Colorado National Monument are made of\r\nWingate and Entrada Sandstones. Underlying them, in the valley bottom,\r\nChinle shales form steep red slopes. (William C. Bradley photo)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Triassic Period\r\n                      (180-225 million years ago)\r\n\r\nSaharan conditions continued to prevail in western North America during\r\nthe early part of the Mesozoic Era. In central Colorado, the lowest\r\nMesozoic deposits are the Triassic Lykins Formation, a series of soft,\r\nbright red sandstones and shales. Where the Lykins is exposed along the\r\nFront Range, its bright red color identifies it. Because of its\r\nsoftness, it is often less prominent than adjacent rock layers in the\r\nmountain foothills. The Lykins Formation includes some evaporites,\r\napparently derived from Permian evaporites washed into the Triassic\r\nponds and lakes which existed occasionally in this region.\r\n\r\nOver almost the entire state, the rocks deposited at this time are very\r\nsimilar. Formation names may differ—Lykins, Moenkopi, Chinle, Ankareh,\r\nWingate—but the rocks are almost universally fine-grained sandstones and\r\nshales with a red or pink color. They represent ancient coastal plain,\r\ndune, or delta deposits. Toward the western edge of the state they\r\ncoarsen, and contain layers of conglomerates similar to the Triassic\r\nconglomerates of northern Arizona and Utah. These suggest that\r\nmountain-building was taking place west of here at that time.\r\n\r\nThere are virtually no fossils known from Triassic rocks in Colorado,\r\nalthough some fossil palm fronds have been found west of the San Juan\r\nMountains, in the southwestern corner of the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Jurassic Period\r\n                      (135-180 million years ago)\r\n\r\nDuring the Jurassic Period, Colorado was still a low, flat desert area\r\nwith intermittent streams flowing eastward over the surface of older\r\nsediments. The Navajo Sandstone, formed from dune sands, was deposited\r\nin the western part of the state. Streams flowing eastward from Utah\r\nbrought fine sediments—silts and muds—to western Colorado, forming what\r\nis now the Carmel Formation. Near Canon City, coarse gravels bear\r\nwitness to local uplift in Jurassic time. Both these gravels and the\r\nCarmel Formation were overlain by more dune sands, now hardened into the\r\nEntrada Sandstone.\r\n\r\nIn Late Jurassic time the Colorado area, which had been predominantly\r\ndesert since Permian time, appears finally to have been submerged once\r\nmore. Fine calcareous muds of the Curtis Formation, containing\r\nammonites, belemnites, and other marine shellfish, show us that a\r\nshallow sea transgressed from the west over the wind-blown sands. This\r\nsea was, geologically speaking, of short duration—only a few million\r\nyears. Bounded on almost all sides by desert, it seems to have dried up,\r\ndepositing the gypsum that is now present in a thin layer along the\r\nFront Range between Denver and Canon City in the Ralston Formation.\r\n\r\nAt about this time, however, the climate underwent a major change.\r\nDeposits above the Ralston indicate an increasingly moist environment,\r\nthe environment in which the Morrison Formation was deposited over most\r\nof Colorado and parts of the adjacent states of Kansas, Arizona, Utah,\r\nand Wyoming. The Morrison Formation is exposed in many places, and is\r\ncharacteristically composed of layers of fine, limy mud, brightly\r\ncolored in streaks of red, brown, green, and blue. In most areas it is\r\nso soft that it becomes soil-covered; it is well exposed only in\r\nroadcuts or where it is protected from erosion by a “caprock” of harder\r\nsediments or lava. Spectacular outcrops can be seen in new roadcuts\r\nalong U. S. Interstate highway 70 just west of Denver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In this roadcut along U. S. Interstate 70 west of Denver,\r\nJurassic and Cretaceous rocks are unusually well exposed in the Dakota\r\nhogback. Green and purple shales represent the dinosaur-bearing Morrison\r\nFormation. The Cretaceous Dakota Group forms the eastern, higher half of\r\nthe cut. Black layers are carbon-rich clays of the South Platte\r\nFormation, frequently quarried locally for ceramic uses. (John Chronic\r\nphoto)]\r\n\r\nFossil dinosaur bones occur in great numbers in the Morrison Formation\r\nnear the towns of Morrison and Canon City and at several other places in\r\nColorado. Those at Canon City have been quarried extensively, and are\r\nnow mounted in a number of museums in the United States. At Dinosaur\r\nNational Monument, in eastern Utah and northwestern Colorado, many\r\nexcellent remains have been found; those in Utah can be seen in place in\r\nthe rock in a striking exhibit at the National Monument.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In an old painting, a paleontologist contemplates fossil\r\nbones found near Morrison. The date is 1877. The bones are those of the\r\n70-foot dinosaur _Apatosaurus_, more commonly known as _Brontosaurus_,\r\nshown below in reconstruction.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Apatosaurus]\r\n\r\nSome of the dinosaurs known from the Morrison Formation reached 80 feet\r\nin length. Both plant-eating and meat-eating types are known. In\r\naddition to the bones themselves, gastroliths or gizzard stones can\r\nfrequently be found; these highly polished stones were as essential to\r\ndinosaur digestion as gravel is to a chicken or a caged canary.\r\n\r\nAlong with the dinosaur fossils are found abundant remains of water\r\nplants called charophytes. These plants formed tiny spiralled balls of\r\ncalcite as part of their reproductive activities; both the little balls\r\nand the stalks of the plants themselves occur in many parts of the\r\nstate. In western Colorado, near Grand Junction, silicified shells of\r\nfreshwater snails can also be found in the Morrison.\r\n\r\nEarly in the 1900s vanadium, radium, and uranium were discovered in\r\nJurassic sandstones and mudstones of western Colorado. Extensive mining\r\nin this area has revealed that these elements often become concentrated\r\nby groundwater in organic material such as fossil plant stems or\r\ndinosaur bones. The search for radioactive minerals has thus brought to\r\nlight many ancient fossil accumulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Cretaceous Period\r\n                       (70-135 million years ago)\r\n\r\nEarly in Cretaceous time, marine conditions once more prevailed in\r\nColorado. This is indicated by a marked change in rock types from beach\r\nand near-shore deposits to true marine sediments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Between the Front Range and the Plains the Cretaceous\r\nDakota Formation forms a hogback ridge which can be traced for 200 miles\r\nor more. The well-cemented sandstone resists erosion, and so remains as\r\na ridge when softer layers are stripped away. (Jack Rathbone photo)]\r\n\r\nThe sandstones derived from beach sands sometimes include coarse pebbles\r\nof chert which can be traced to sources in Permian rocks of Utah and\r\nNevada. Occasionally the beach and near-shore deposits include marine\r\nshells like oysters, indicating that there were brackish and salt water\r\nlagoons and marshes along the shore. The Dakota Formation represents the\r\nbeach of the transgressive or advancing sea. This formation contains oil\r\nin eastern Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming; the oil itself may have been\r\nderived from decay of organic materials in swamps behind the beaches and\r\nbars.\r\n\r\nAs the sea deepened in eastern Colorado, finer sediments were deposited.\r\nThese included the black muds of the Benton Shale, and the Niobrara\r\nLimestone, a shallow-water deposit containing abundant shells of clams\r\n(_Inoceramus_ and _Ostrea_) and ammonites and tiny one-celled animals\r\ncalled Foraminiferida. Above the Benton and Niobrara Formations lie the\r\nfine gray muds of the Pierre Shale. Several thousand feet thick, the\r\nPierre contains occasional beautifully preserved ammonite shells as well\r\nas bones from fossil fish and swimming reptiles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cretaceous rocks in Colorado are rich in fossil\r\npelecypods. Each of the fossils illustrated above may grow to a much\r\nlarger size than shown.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shales of the Laramie Formation contain many recognizable\r\nplant fossils.]\r\n\r\nThe rocks deposited in western Colorado at this time are markedly\r\ndifferent from those deposited in eastern Colorado. In the east,\r\ndeposits are fine and very limy, containing abundant shells and little\r\nin the way of coarse debris. In the west, sandstones of the Mesa Verde\r\nFormation dominate, and coal beds suggest marshy or swampy conditions\r\ninshore from the ancient ocean. This is just the pattern we would expect\r\nfrom a low-lying region bordering a shallow sea, a region similar\r\nperhaps to the southeastern Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United\r\nStates today.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the Cretaceous Period, the sea receded from Colorado.\r\nBeaches and bars of the retreating sea left a sandstone layer which now\r\noutcrops prominently east of the Front Range as the Fox Hills Sandstone.\r\nAbove lie interbedded sands and coals, the Laramie Formation. The\r\npresence of coal above beach sands shows that the coal swamps moved\r\neastward as the sea retreated.\r\n\r\nThe exact age of the shoreline deposits and coal beds varies from place\r\nto place in such a way as to indicate that the sea withdrew slowly and\r\nirregularly. In general the shore moved eastward, but there are\r\nlocalities such as North Park where deposition lasted much longer than\r\nelsewhere. In some places no real beach was formed at the ancient strand\r\nline.\r\n\r\nIn western Colorado, the end of Cretaceous time is marked by coarser\r\nbeds, indicating an increased rate of uplift in Utah. Conglomerates were\r\ndeposited in the beds of the McDermott Formation, now visible along the\r\nAnimas River south of Durango.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CENOZOIC ERA\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of earth history that the younger the rocks are,\r\nthe more we know about them. This is because younger rocks lie near the\r\nsurface, have not been disturbed as much by mountain building processes\r\nas have older rocks, and have not been affected as strongly by repeated\r\nerosion. Many of the events of the Cenozoic Era are documented in detail\r\nin the geology of Colorado, and these events have intimately influenced\r\nthe scenery as we see it today.\r\n\r\nThe Cenozoic is the Age of Mammals. How it happened that mammals\r\ntriumphed over reptiles is one of the mysteries of geology. Some\r\nscientists think that climatic changes—dropping temperatures and\r\nincreases in rainfall—swung the balance in favor of the warm-blooded\r\nmammals. Others believe that cosmic ray bombardment during some unusual\r\nastronomical event may have destroyed many surface-living dinosaurs,\r\nwhile small burrowing mammals (as well as many small reptiles) were able\r\nto survive. Still others maintain that the superior intelligence and\r\nregulated body temperatures of mammals enabled them to win out in the\r\nbattle for survival without the aid of climatic or cosmic change.\r\n\r\nThe names Tertiary and Quaternary, used for the two Cenozoic Periods,\r\nare holdovers from early studies in geology in which rocks were divided\r\ninto Primary (very hard, crystalline rocks such as igneous and\r\nmetamorphic rocks), Secondary (well consolidated layered rocks),\r\nTertiary (layered rocks which are not fully cemented but which are\r\nnevertheless fairly well consolidated), and Quaternary (sediments in\r\nwhich the grains have not become cemented together).\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Tertiary Period\r\n                        (3-70 million years ago)\r\n\r\nDuring the first part of the Tertiary Period, uplift began in earnest in\r\nColorado and adjacent states. This uplift was part of the great Laramide\r\nOrogeny that built the Rocky Mountain chain from Alaska to New Mexico.\r\nThe entire area rose above the level of the sea, and mountains were\r\nthrust up in a great series of north-south ranges that extended unbroken\r\nalmost the length of the continent. Between the ranges, thick layers of\r\ngravel and sand, derived from the surrounding highlands, were deposited\r\nin intermontane basins. Occasional freshwater limestones and shales\r\nindicate the presence of lakes.\r\n\r\nIn Colorado, many details of the formation of the Rockies stand out in\r\nbold relief. The Front Range moved upward sharply, mostly as a linear\r\nblock broken or faulted along both edges. Paleozoic and Mesozoic\r\nsediments along the margins of the block were steeply tipped and in some\r\nplaces even overturned, while in some localities Precambrian rocks were\r\nthrust out over the younger sediments.\r\n\r\nJust east of the Front Range, especially in the area around Denver, the\r\nland remained lower and was the site of thick deposits of gravel and\r\nsand eroded from the range. The Denver Formation, the Arapahoe\r\nConglomerate, and the Dawson Arkose are more than 2,000 feet thick in\r\nthis area. These are delta and river sediments, all varying a great deal\r\nfrom place to place. Individual layers of sand or gravel are not\r\ncontinuous over extensive areas, but some, such as the Castle Rock\r\nConglomerate, are very prominent locally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: On Wolford Mountain, just north of Kremmling, Precambrian\r\ngranite lies on top of Cretaceous shale. The older rocks were thrust up\r\nand over younger rocks during the Laramide Orogeny. The position of the\r\nfault shows clearly because trees prefer the granite soil above the\r\nfault to the shale below. (Jack Rathbone photo)]\r\n\r\nAlong the eastern margin of the Front Range west of Castle Rock and\r\nSedalia, rocks deposited at this time are now folded steeply, indicating\r\nthat the mountains continued to rise even as basin sediments were being\r\ndeposited.\r\n\r\nIn southern Colorado, the Sangre de Cristo and Wet Mountains were also\r\nformed as upthrust blocks. Between them, the Huerfano Basin and\r\nadjoining Raton Basin received particularly rapid alluvial deposition.\r\nIn the Raton Basin, quantities of vegetation were deposited in swamps\r\nand marshes, forming the thick coal beds which can now be seen in road\r\ncuts west of Trinidad and along the Raton Pass highway. Huerfano Basin\r\ndeposits contain some of the earliest known horse remains, skeletons of\r\na tiny four-toed horse called _Hyracotherium_ (formerly known as\r\n_Eohippus_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bones of _Hyracotherium_, the “dawn horse,” have been\r\nfound northwest of Walsenburg in Early Tertiary sediments of the\r\nHuerfano Basin.

Knight painting, courtesy American Museum of\r\nNatural History)]\r\n\r\nOther rising ranges provided material for alluvial deposition in North\r\nPark, Middle Park, South Park, and the San Luis Valley. Layers of basalt\r\nand volcanic peaks show that as the mountains rose, the crust cracked\r\nand allowed lava to rise to the surface in great quantities. Tertiary\r\nbasalts are very much part of the Colorado landscape: some can be seen\r\nwest of Granby, others in Table Mountains east of Golden. Near Boulder,\r\nValmont Dike was intruded, though lava may not have reached the surface\r\nin that area. Spanish Peaks in southern Colorado, Mesa de Maya, the\r\nRabbit Ears Range, Grand and Battlement Mesas, and many other volcanic\r\nfeatures were formed at this time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The town of Golden nestles between the Front Range and\r\nSouth Table Mountain. Tertiary basalt capping South Table Mountain\r\ncovers beds of the Denver Formation. It thins to the right, or south,\r\nindicating that its source was probably to the north or northwest.\r\nBuildings in the right foreground are the Colorado School of Mines.\r\n(Jack Rathbone photo)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A series of almost vertical dikes radiate from West\r\nSpanish Peak. Surrounding sediments are Tertiary. Weathering and erosion\r\nalong sets of joints in the largest dike have shaped it into the\r\n“Devil’s Staircase.” (Jack Rathbone photo)]\r\n\r\nMost of the rich mineral deposits of Colorado are thought also to have\r\nbeen formed during the early part of the Tertiary Period. Solutions rich\r\nin gold, silver, zinc, lead, copper, and sulfides of iron seeped into\r\njoints and faults in the crust as the mountains were pushed upward. Ore\r\nminerals crystallized out, sometimes in veins in the ancient Precambrian\r\nigneous and metamorphic rocks, sometimes in Paleozoic sediments. These\r\nare further discussed in Chapter III.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Eocene Green River Formation includes great\r\nthicknesses of oil shale, an untapped petroleum reserve containing\r\nperhaps three trillion barrels of oil. The richest part of the oil shale\r\nis a dark brown layer called Mahogany Ledge, visible here on cliffs just\r\nwest of Rifle. If placed in a campfire, fragments of this shale release\r\nenough oil to burn with a yellow, smoky flame. (Jack Rathbone photo)]\r\n\r\nFurther to the north and west, the Uinta Mountains rose. They are a\r\nfault-block range, but they lie at right angles to the general\r\nnorth-south trend of the Rocky Mountains. South of them the Uinta Basin,\r\none of the largest of the intermontane basins, received shaly deposits\r\nin a great lake which existed here for probably several million years.\r\nThe lake extended over some 100,000 square miles, and during its\r\nexistence great quantities of tiny organisms lived in its waters. Oily\r\nmaterial from these organisms was deposited in the mud of the lake\r\nsediments, particularly in the eastern end of the basin, there to remain\r\ntrapped in a great oil-shale deposit. Fossil fish, crayfish, algae, and\r\nmany forms of insect and plant life have been found as fossils in these\r\nlake shales.\r\n\r\nWest of Pikes Peak, another lake formed, dammed by a lava flow from a\r\nnearby volcanic field. Fine volcanic ash falling into this lake\r\npreserved the trunks and leaves of many plants as well as abundant\r\ninsects, fish, and occasional mammal bones. These are now protected and\r\nexhibited in Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument. The fossil\r\nplants, among them redwoods, poplar, hackberry, and pine, suggest a\r\nclimate warmer than the present one, and have been taken to indicate\r\nthat regional uplift to the present altitude had not yet occurred.\r\n\r\nAnother rich deposit of fossil insects and plants occurs near Creede.\r\nOther lake deposits in South Park contain ash layers with fossil algae\r\nand snails.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Large petrified trunks of redwoods and other trees can be\r\nseen at Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument, west of Colorado\r\nSprings. (John Chronic photo)]\r\n\r\nIn southwestern Colorado, extensive Tertiary lava flows, ash falls, and\r\nriver deposits form the eastern part of the San Juan Mountains, the\r\nlargest volcanic area in the state. Mineral collectors are attracted to\r\nthis region by the many excellent localities for agate and other\r\nsiliceous stones.\r\n\r\nStill another center of Tertiary volcanism was located in what is now\r\nRocky Mountain National Park. Specimen Mountain, northwest of Trail\r\nRidge, was an active volcano about 30 million years ago, shedding ash\r\nand lava over much of northern Colorado. The rhyolite which now caps the\r\nhill west of Iceberg Lake, on Trail Ridge Road, was derived from this\r\nvolcano, but is now separated from it by the deep glaciated valley of\r\nthe Cache la Poudre River and Milner Pass.\r\n\r\nVolcanic ash at times drifted far eastward and blanketed the surface of\r\nthe plains, burying specimens of many animals and plants. The White\r\nRiver Formation, extending from northeast Colorado northward into South\r\nDakota, is formed of such drifting ash. Many now-extinct mammals have\r\nbeen excavated from this formation.\r\n\r\nSometime after the mid-Tertiary episode of violent volcanic activity,\r\nColorado was uplifted to its present altitude. This was a general\r\nuplift, raising the plains and plateau areas as well as the mountains.\r\nThe uplift was not an abrupt process, but continued for perhaps ten\r\nmillion years. It raised the entire state 3,000 to 5,000 feet above its\r\nprevious level.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pawnee Buttes, about 40 miles north of Fort Morgan, rise\r\nlike castles from the eastern Prairie Province. Remnants of Oligocene\r\nand Miocene sedimentary rock that once covered much of northeastern\r\nColorado and adjacent states, they contain jaws, teeth, and other bones\r\nof primitive mammals. (Department of Highways photo)]\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the Tertiary Period, Colorado was the site of\r\nerosion rather than deposition. However, some stream material was\r\ndeposited in the mountain valleys, and on the prairies wind-blown and\r\nstream-borne sands were spread thinly, interlayered with impure\r\nlimestones deposited in ponds and lakes. In the San Luis Valley,\r\ndeposition was probably more continuous than elsewhere, as the exit from\r\nthe valley was blocked by volcanic flows. The deposits in this valley,\r\nsands and clays of the Santa Fe and Alamosa Formations, form a great\r\nartesian basin. The rich agricultural development of the valley is made\r\npossible by water wells tapping these formations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Remains of many now-extinct mammals have been found in\r\nTertiary sedimentary rocks of northeastern Colorado, in the general area\r\nof Pawnee Buttes. Those illustrated are _Oreodon_ from Oligocene strata\r\nand a “giraffe-camel” (_Oxydactylus_) from Miocene rocks.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Quaternary Period\r\n                    (3 million years ago to present)\r\n\r\nThe most significant feature of the Quaternary Period in Colorado, as\r\nelsewhere in the northern hemisphere, is the evidence of glaciation.\r\nDuring the first part of the Quaternary Period, known as the Pleistocene\r\nEpoch, great continental glaciers covered most of Canada and much of\r\nnorthern United States. The ice sheets did not extend southward as far\r\nas Colorado, but large valley glaciers developed in many of the mountain\r\nranges of the state and left their traces in many mountain valleys.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mills and Jewel Lakes, in Rocky Mountain National Park,\r\noccupy small glacier-gouged basins in Glacier Gorge. The flat-topped\r\npeak at the upper left is Longs Peak, elevation 14,256 feet; Pagoda\r\nMountain is in the center of the skyline. Bedrock in this area is\r\nPrecambrian granite, gneiss, and schist at the Front Range “core.” (Jack\r\nRathbone photo)]\r\n\r\nThe conditions leading to Pleistocene glaciation are not fully\r\nunderstood. Climatic changes may have been initiated by a decrease in\r\nsolar radiation, changing patterns of ocean currents, reduction of solar\r\nheating by volcanic dust, or an increase in general elevation of the\r\nland. As the climate became cooler and moister, snowfall increased in\r\nthe north and at high altitudes. In areas where winter snowfall exceeded\r\nsummer melting, glaciers developed.\r\n\r\nIn Colorado, glaciers formed along the crests of the Front Range, the\r\nSawatch Range, the Elk Mountains and West Elk Mountains, the Sangre de\r\nCristo and Mosquito Ranges, the San Juan Mountains, and the Park and\r\nGore Ranges. Glaciation in Colorado was selective: in many places\r\nelevation was sufficient for glaciation, but snowfall apparently was not\r\ngreat enough. Where they did occur, the glaciers extended down to\r\nelevations of about 8,000 feet. There, temperatures became mild enough\r\nto melt the ice.\r\n\r\nThe mountain glaciers have left many tell-tale signs of their presence.\r\nValleys above 8,000 feet are U-shaped, their upper ends bounded by\r\nhorseshoe-shaped, steep-walled cirques. In the lower portions of the\r\nvalleys, at elevations just above 8,000 feet, lie long lines of glacial\r\ndebris known as moraines: terminal moraines forming crescents across the\r\nvalleys to show where melting glaciers dropped their rocky loads;\r\nlateral moraines along the sides of valleys; medial moraines where\r\nglaciers from two valleys met. Terminal moraines, often forming\r\neffective barriers across the present streams, may act as dams, creating\r\nlakes such as Grand Lake in Rocky Mountain National Park.\r\n\r\nThere were at least three distinct glacial episodes in Colorado. This is\r\nknown because careful studies of glacial debris in moraines reveal three\r\ndifferent degrees of rock weathering. All three stages can be seen in or\r\nnear Rocky Mountain National Park. The oldest is represented by a\r\nmoraine about three miles west of Estes Park, where the Big Thompson\r\nRiver traverses a wide U-shaped valley before entering its narrow,\r\nunglaciated canyon. The next oldest is represented in terminal moraines\r\nfurther up the valley, at Aspenglen campground. The youngest is shown in\r\na prominent terminal moraine about one mile west of the park entrance in\r\nHorseshoe Park.\r\n\r\nA large lateral moraine separates Hidden Valley from the south side of\r\nHorseshoe Park, and an almost equally large lateral moraine is present\r\non the north side of this valley. At Moraine Park, both sides of the\r\nvalley are edged with lateral moraines also.\r\n\r\nStudies in Rocky Mountain National Park have revealed many other details\r\nof glaciation in this area. These are described in Park Service\r\nbrochures and guidebooks, in the museum at Park headquarters, and in\r\ninformative roadside signs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A line of hikers approaches Arapaho Glacier, west of\r\nBoulder. Movement of the glacier is evidenced by the crevasses apparent\r\njust below the snowfield in the dirty gray glacial ice. (H. H. Heuston\r\nphoto)]\r\n\r\nSeveral small glaciers are still present in the Colorado mountains, all\r\nin sheltered cirques above 11,000 feet. These may be remnants of the\r\nformer larger glaciers, or new glaciers formed after a long warming\r\nepisode. A hike to one of these glaciers is a rewarding experience for\r\nanyone interested in geology. Some of the more accessible are St. Mary’s\r\nGlacier west of Denver, Arapaho Glacier west of Boulder (the Boulder\r\nChamber of Commerce sponsors a festive hike to Arapaho Glacier every\r\nAugust), and Tyndall Glacier in Rocky Mountain National Park.\r\n\r\nThe Ice Age brought drastic changes also to the landscape below 8,000\r\nfeet elevation. Heavily loaded with glacial debris, mountain streams\r\ndisgorged coarse sands and gravels along the mountain front and in the\r\nintermontane basins. As the glaciers melted after each period of\r\nexpansion, the swollen streams cut deeply into their former deposits and\r\ninto much older rocks as well. Royal Gorge, the Black Canyon of the\r\nGunnison, and many of the deep, colorful canyons of the Plateau Province\r\nwere cut or at least deepened by these waters. The canyons along the\r\neast face of the mountains—Big Thompson, Boulder, Clear Creek, and\r\nothers—were also deepened and sharpened by the rushing ice-fed torrents.\r\n\r\nOn the prairies, rivers dumping their loads of sand covered the older\r\nrocks. Sand dunes developed along the river channels. Bones and huge\r\ntusks of hairy mammoths were sometimes buried in these soft deposits;\r\nnow they are occasionally revealed as the dune and river sands are\r\nwashed or blown away by continuing erosion.\r\n\r\nAbout 20,000 years ago, man arrived in Colorado. Soon after this, the\r\nwater supply of the valleys diminished greatly, and erosion slowed down\r\ncorrespondingly. The climate gradually became semiarid to arid. Many\r\nfeatures of the natural scene were much as they must have been a century\r\nago, without the highways, dams, and television aerials of today.\r\nBuffalo and many smaller types of game roamed the plains and foothills;\r\ndeer, elk, and bighorn sheep were plentiful in the mountains. Nomadic\r\ntribes camped and hunted in both mountain and prairie. In the western\r\npart of the state, homes could be built in the shelter of great caves,\r\nas at Mesa Verde, and game could be supplemented with corn and squash\r\nplanted on plateau surfaces.\r\n\r\nSeveral features of Colorado scenery changed with increasing aridity.\r\nThe glaciers of course were gone or nearly gone. Streams were no longer\r\nthe violent torrents they had been. Many mountain lakes, filled with\r\nsediment and vegetation, became instead mountain meadows. And the once\r\nfertile intermontane valleys became deserts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: During the last Ice Age, elephant-like mastodons roamed\r\nColorado. As present-day erosion removes sediments, bones, teeth, and\r\ntusks are frequently exposed, especially in the Prairie Province. (C. R.\r\nKnight painting, courtesy American Museum of Natural History)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mastodon]\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side of the San Luis Valley, the Great Sand Dunes\r\ndeveloped at this time. These dunes nestle against the Sangre de Cristo\r\nRange, where strong southwesterly winds blowing across the wide valley\r\ntend to funnel toward Mosca and Music Passes. These winds lift loads of\r\nsand from the lightly vegetated valley floor, and drop it as they rise\r\nover the mountains. Where the sand is dropped, the dunes have formed.\r\nThey rise to about 700 feet above the valley floor, and cover about\r\nforty square miles. The low rainfall of the area, seven to eight inches\r\nper year, keeps vegetation from creeping over the dunes and makes them a\r\nmost distinctive feature of Colorado, a lesson in geology in the making.\r\n\r\n                            * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nGeologic processes in Colorado now seem to be much reduced from what\r\nthey were a few thousand years ago. Reduction in rainfall has led to\r\nreduced erosion. Mountain-building, having reached a climax in Tertiary\r\ntime, has declined markedly. However, we find evidence that volcanism\r\nhas occurred within the last few thousand years and faulting within the\r\nlast few hundred, and Colorado streams rise after sudden mountain storms\r\nto approximate the violent torrents of glacial times. Colorado’s\r\nscenery, fashioned during some three billion years of earth history, is\r\never changing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Great Sand Dunes of Colorado were formed during\r\nPleistocene and Recent time by deposition of quartz sand lifted from\r\nunconsolidated alluvial deposits in the San Luis Valley.

The\r\nensuing gold rush, coming ten years after the rush to California,\r\nrivalled it in fury and brought sudden wealth to lucky miners and the\r\nadventurous merchants who grubstaked them. Several hundred mining towns\r\nor “camps” sprang into existence almost overnight, their sites\r\ndetermined by the geology of the mountain areas. The cities of Denver,\r\nBoulder, and Golden were established as milling and shipping centers for\r\nthe products of the mines. In 1876 the now-wealthy area, previously part\r\nof Kansas Territory, became the State of Colorado.\r\n\r\nFor more than a hundred years Colorado’s minerals—products of her long\r\nand diverse geologic history—have influenced her development in many\r\nways. The state’s early wealth, stemming from bonanzas in gold and\r\nsilver, is evidenced by palatial homes, hotels, and public buildings\r\nconstructed during the first few decades of mining activity. Some of\r\nthese are still standing—the opera houses at Central City and Aspen,\r\nCentral City’s famous Teller House, and the Grand Imperial Hotel at\r\nSilverton are examples.\r\n\r\nMany of the stories and legends of Colorado’s gold camps are recounted\r\nin _Stampede to Timberline_, by Muriel Sibell Wolle, delightfully\r\nillustrated with sketches of old mining towns as they appear today.\r\n_Mining in Colorado_, published by the U. S. Geological Survey, also\r\nmakes fascinating reading, as it contains many historical anecdotes and\r\neyewitness accounts of gold-rush days.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of the metal-mining areas in Colorado followed a definite\r\nsequence. Placer gold was usually discovered first. Recovery of placer\r\ngold was followed by mining of gold from veins or “lodes.” Although at\r\nfirst only native gold was mined, gold-bearing compounds such as\r\ntelluride were soon recognized as an additional source, especially at\r\nGold Hill, Cripple Creek, and of course the camp that came to be known\r\nas Telluride. As gold sources were depleted, silver, first produced as a\r\nbyproduct, became of prime interest. Lead and zinc were in turn\r\nbyproducts of silver mining. Other metals, notably copper, vanadium,\r\ntungsten, and iron, were produced later. Molybdenum is the\r\nJohnny-come-lately of the state’s mining industry, but is now the chief\r\nmetal produced. A uranium boom in the 1950s brought a short rush to\r\nwestern Colorado and new vigor to the economy.\r\n\r\nOil was discovered near Canon City in 1862. The nearby Florence field\r\nand a small, shallow field near Boulder preceded much greater\r\ndiscoveries in the Denver Basin, the Uinta Basin, and southwest\r\nColorado. Oil reservoirs, confined to areas of sedimentary rock, are\r\nfound primarily in the Prairie and Plateau Provinces of the state, and\r\nrecovery of the oil has done much to distribute population to these\r\nareas.\r\n\r\nCoal is also restricted to sedimentary rock areas. Coal production in\r\nColorado has waxed and waned with the years, but has provided fuel for\r\nexport, for the railroads, for the manufacture of electric power, and\r\nfor many of the state’s industries.\r\n\r\nA good picture of present mineral production in Colorado can be obtained\r\nfrom the following summary for 1971, prepared by the Colorado Bureau of\r\nMines:\r\n\r\n                        Product                Value\r\n\r\n               Molybdenum                    $105,389,456\r\n               Petroleum                       90,494,459\r\n               Sand and gravel                 32,842,503\r\n               Coal                            30,251,443\r\n               Natural gas                     18,695,225\r\n               Uranium                         18,048,692\r\n               Vanadium                        15,863,554\r\n               Cement                          13,377,520\r\n               Zinc                            13,310,787\r\n               Lead                             6,582,025\r\n               Tungsten                         6,360,020\r\n               Limestone and dolomite           5,397,570\r\n               Silver                           4,198,054\r\n               Fluorspar                        3,887,210\r\n               Copper                           3,875,976\r\n               Stone                            1,961,279\r\n               Gold                             1,832,791\r\n               Clay                               962,986\r\n               Iron                               880,047\r\n               Pumice                             309,370\r\n               Tin                                278,862\r\n               Gypsum                             253,856\r\n               Pyrites                            142,640\r\n               All others                       1,091,927\r\n                  Total                    ($376,288,252)\r\n\r\nColorado is now the nation’s leading producer of molybdenum, tin, and\r\nvanadium, and second in output of tungsten. In oil production it ranked\r\ntwelfth among the states in 1968, but ninth in reserves, with\r\n420,000,000 barrels of proven reserves on 1 January 1969. An as yet\r\nuntapped source of oil lies in the oil shales of western Colorado.\r\n\r\nAs part of the natural environment, water plays a major role in man’s\r\nactivities. Water problems in Colorado revolve mainly around the best\r\nuse of runoff in a state whose major catchment basins are across the\r\ncontinental divide from her largest population centers and most fertile\r\nfarm land. Groundwater, closely related to surface water distribution\r\nand movement, is a geological problem, and in Colorado as in other\r\nstates many government and private geologists serve farm and industrial\r\ncommunities in the search for usable supplies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUTION: Old mines are dangerous! They may contain water or deadly\r\ngases, or be on the verge of collapse. Keep away from abandoned prospect\r\npits and mine shafts. WARN AND WATCH YOUR CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     GOLD, SILVER, AND OTHER METALS\r\n\r\nColorado’s placer and lode sources of gold, which gave first impetus to\r\nthe series of mining booms in the state, were fantastically rich. Summit\r\nand Lake Counties, for instance, each produced more than $5,000,000 in\r\nplacer gold between 1859 and 1867. During the same nine-year period,\r\nmore than $9,000,000 in lode gold was produced from Gregory Gulch, a\r\ntiny canyon between Central City and Black Hawk. Other districts\r\nrivalled or surpassed these figures.\r\n\r\nEarly in the game it was recognized that almost all the deposits\r\noccurred along what came to be known as the “mineral belt,” a\r\nfifty-mile-wide zone extending southwest from the Boulder region. Most\r\nof the metals mined in the state come from this belt, but there are\r\nthree notable exceptions: Cripple Creek, Silver Cliff, and western\r\nColorado vanadium and uranium districts. In the first few years of the\r\nColorado rush, gold ores and placer gold were discovered only in the\r\nnortheastern part of the mineral belt. Gradually the belt was found to\r\nextend further and further southwest: Tincup was discovered in 1861,\r\nSilverton in 1870, Lake City in 1871, and Telluride in 1875. Aspen, on\r\nthe western edge of the belt, was not discovered until 1879, perhaps\r\nbecause the area was difficult of access and lacked the easily\r\nrecognizable native gold.\r\n\r\nIn the northeast part of the mineral belt, gold and other minerals occur\r\nin veins in Precambrian granite and gneiss. In the Leadville and Aspen\r\nareas, ores are associated with altered Paleozoic limestones. At the\r\nsouthwest end of the mineral belt, in the San Juan Mountains, ore veins\r\nare found near or in Tertiary volcanic rocks. Native gold, gold-bearing\r\ncompounds, and other metallic ores in these veins originated where\r\nmineral-rich solutions from deep within the earth penetrated fissures\r\nand joints in the surrounding rock. Regardless of the age of the host\r\nrock, almost all the ores of Colorado were deposited in the early or\r\nmiddle Tertiary Period, about 35 to 70 million years ago.\r\n\r\nGold and silver are no longer mined extensively in Colorado, although\r\nany summer Sunday will see weekend operators panning near mountain\r\nstreams or trundling rock from one-man mines. The recent rise in the\r\nprice of silver has encouraged many miners to reopen old shafts. The\r\nmost active mines in the state today are those producing molybdenum,\r\nlead, zinc, and vanadium. (Vanadium, although a metal, usually occurs in\r\nColorado with radioactive minerals, and so is discussed with them rather\r\nthan with the metals.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Colorado mineral belt extends from Boulder County on\r\nthe northeast to San Juan County on the southwest.

Each of these districts had the right\r\nto draw up its own regulations concerning prospecting, claims, and\r\nmining rights, within a framework established by the Federal government.\r\nOnly a few of the districts ever became really significant producers.\r\nThe geology and history of several of the leading areas are presented in\r\nthe pages that follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Boulder County\r\n\r\nGold Run, near Gold Hill, was the scene of one of the earliest strikes\r\nin Colorado. Gold was found here in December 1858, and was sluiced from\r\nstream sands and mined from veins early in 1859. Active placer mining\r\nlasted only about a year, however, and lode mining dropped off rapidly\r\nas near-surface oxidized ores were worked out. When a smelter was\r\nerected at Black Hawk in 1868, and sulfide ores could be treated, there\r\nwas a revival of activity. In 1869 the Caribou and Poorman mines near\r\nNederland were discovered; they quickly became the most active mines in\r\nthe county. The Ward district opened soon after.\r\n\r\nIn 1872, a gold-silver telluride called petzite was found in veins at\r\nGold Hill. Renewed prospecting in this area resulted in location of\r\nmines near Sunshine, Salina, and Magnolia. During the years that\r\nfollowed, new mines appeared almost as fast as old ones were depleted.\r\nIn 1892, the peak year, more than $1,000,000 in gold and silver was\r\nproduced; total production has been about $25,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1900, a black mineral common in the Nederland area was recognized as\r\nferberite, an ore of tungsten, and a new rush to the area started.\r\nDuring the next eighteen years Boulder County was the main tungsten\r\nproducer in the United States; about 24,000 tons of tungsten trioxide,\r\nworth $23,000,000, were produced here. The ore was found in nearly\r\nvertical veins six inches to three feet thick, in a lenticular area\r\nabout nine miles long extending from Nederland northeast to Arkansas\r\nMountain, four miles west of Boulder.\r\n\r\nBoulder County is characterized by an abundance of small mines. Old\r\nshafts, pits, and mine buildings can be found throughout the central\r\npart of the county. Little mining is done here today; many of the towns\r\nthat once peppered these hills have fallen into decay or disappeared\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Central City and Idaho Springs\r\n\r\nThe Central City-Idaho Springs area was the principal metal mining\r\nregion in the state until the late 1880s. In 1858, rich placer deposits\r\nwere discovered in gravels and river terraces along both forks of Clear\r\nCreek. Exploration upstream led to discoveries of rich oxidized quartz\r\nveins at Central City, Black Hawk, and Idaho Springs. These veins, which\r\ngenerally trend northeast-southwest, extend through the mountains in a\r\nzone about six miles long and three miles wide between the two forks of\r\nClear Creek.\r\n\r\nThe ores filled a multitude of cracks and fissures in the Precambrian\r\nbedrock. The veins are usually less than five feet thick, and are almost\r\nvertical and often clustered in zones up to thirty feet wide. The\r\nposition of one of the vein systems may be seen clearly between Black\r\nHawk and Central City—the ore-bearing rock has been mined out, but a\r\nseries of collapsed tunnels marks the line where the veins crossed the\r\nvalley. A monument here commemorates the discovery of Gregory Gulch, one\r\nof the richest localities in the state.\r\n\r\nSeveral rich veins were mined in both directions—southwest from Central\r\nCity and northeast from Idaho Springs—until the mines met. The Argo\r\ntunnel, marked by dilapidated buildings and extensive dumps on the north\r\nside of Idaho Springs, connected the two districts; it was completed in\r\n1904.\r\n\r\nThe “Patch,” a deep crater-like hole on Quartz Hill, about one mile\r\nsouthwest of Central City, is an intriguing feature in this area. It was\r\nproduced by glory-holing, a mining technique in which a deep tunnel is\r\ndeliberately caved by blasting, so that ores above the tunnel can be\r\nremoved. This glory hole was dynamited below an irregular mass of highly\r\nbroken rock where many ore-rich veins converged. After the caving, ores\r\nwere taken out through the remaining part of the tunnel.\r\n\r\nThe principal ore minerals of Central City and Idaho Springs are native\r\ngold, pyrite, sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite, and tennantite.\r\nProspecting for uranium was carried out during the 1950s but no uranium\r\nwas ever mined here.\r\n\r\nThe area has produced almost $200,000,000 worth of gold, silver, lead,\r\nzinc, and copper. A few mines still operate seasonally or on a small\r\nscale, but tourists, many of them riding Jeeps across the mountainous\r\nterrain to visit mines and ghost towns, are often more visibly active\r\nthan the mines.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Georgetown, Empire, and Silver Plume\r\n\r\nA few miles southwest of Idaho Springs, another mining area had a\r\nsimilar, though less productive, history. In 1859, placer and lode gold\r\nwere discovered near what is now Georgetown. Placer mining dominated\r\nhere between 1859 and 1863. Gravel and crushed rock from decomposed\r\nquartz and sulfide veins were washed through sluiceboxes in the same way\r\nas placer gravel, gold being caught in riffles or gunny sacking on the\r\nbottoms of the troughs. The veins were found to be decomposed to depths\r\nof about 40 feet; below this the gold occurred closely associated with\r\nsulfides such as pyrite, sphalerite, galena, and chalcopyrite, from\r\nwhich it could not easily be separated. However, smelters were developed\r\nin 1866 for treatment of these sulfides, and gold, silver, lead, and\r\ncopper were recovered. Gradually, as the gold was worked out, silver and\r\nlead became the important products of the mines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sluicebox mining was a common sight near the early gold\r\ncamps, where primary recovery was from placer deposits or decomposed\r\nquartz and sulfide veins. (State Historical Society of Colorado photo)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Leadville\r\n\r\nPlacer gold was discovered in 1859 in California Gulch, about seven\r\nmiles north of the present town of Leadville. The rush that followed was\r\nshort but sweet; the camp was called Oro—gold! About $5,000,000 was\r\nproduced from the placer mines within two years, though by 1861 the area\r\nwas all but deserted, for the easily won placer gold was gone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Early-day Leadville sprawled among its mine dumps at an\r\nelevation of 10,200 feet. The Sawatch Range, in the background,\r\ncontained many smaller mining communities, now deserted. Mt. Massive,\r\nthe state’s second highest peak, forms the crest of the continental\r\ndivide here. (State Historical Society of Colorado photo)]\r\n\r\nIn 1875 a smelter was erected a few miles downstream from Oro to process\r\ncerussite—silver-rich lead carbonate—that occurred in the placer sands.\r\nFor years this mineral had been considered a nuisance because, being\r\nmuch heavier than sand, it tended to separate out with the gold. The new\r\ntown of Leadville sprang up near the smelter and shortly afterward more\r\nlode deposits were discovered south of the placer workings. From $63,000\r\nin 1875, production climbed to $2,500,000 in 1878 and more than\r\n$15,000,000 in the peak year of 1882.\r\n\r\nGeologically, the ores of this district occur as Tertiary replacements\r\nand veins in Ordovician, Devonian, and Mississippian limestones. The\r\n“Blue” or Leadville Limestone, of Mississippian age, contains the\r\nrichest ore. Ore deposits were formed after the limestones had been\r\nfaulted and cracked extensively by mountain-building movements; the ores\r\nthemselves probably crystallized from molten or gaseous materials\r\ninvolved in related igneous intrusions. River gravels and glacial debris\r\nmask the true nature of the lode deposits, but studies in the mines show\r\nthat the fault systems along which ores are deposited trend north or\r\nnorth-northeast.\r\n\r\nThe Leadville district is now experiencing its third mining boom as a\r\nnewly recognized lead-zinc orebody is being developed. Production is\r\nexpected to reach 700 tons of ore per day by 1971. Total production of\r\ngold, silver, lead, zinc, and copper in the district has reached\r\n$500,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Breckenridge\r\n\r\nBreckenridge was also discovered in 1859, with placer gold the first\r\nattraction. The placers gave out in 1862 after about $3,000,000 in gold\r\nhad been recovered. Earliest attempts to mine the rich silver and lead\r\nveins of the district were in 1869.\r\n\r\nAs at Leadville, the sedimentary rocks of the area were intruded by\r\ngranitic masses in Tertiary time, but here the sedimentary rocks are\r\nmostly Pennsylvanian sandstones and shales. These rocks were badly\r\nfaulted and broken during the intrusion, and the ores were deposited as\r\nthe granitic material cooled. The lode deposits occur mostly in small\r\nveins well hidden by surface sands and gravels. Some of the veins\r\nyielded exceptionally beautiful crystallized wire and flake gold,\r\nspecimens of which are on display at the Colorado School of Mines\r\nlibrary in Golden and in the Denver Museum of Natural History.\r\n\r\nDredging for alluvial gold was attempted in 1898 in the Breckenridge\r\ndistrict, but this method of extracting gold was not successful until\r\n1905. A number of dredges operated between 1910 and 1925. These floating\r\nbehemoths shovel up gold-bearing gravels from the bottom and one side of\r\nthe pond on which they float, sort out the gold in giant sluiceboxes,\r\nand spew out the leftover gravels in great arc-shaped heaps that can be\r\nseen near Breckenridge and Fairplay and in a number of other valleys in\r\nColorado. They depend for their operation on a plentiful supply of water\r\nand a shallow water table, but they can sift through quantities of\r\ngravel at relatively low cost. All told, about $7,000,000 in gold has\r\nbeen dredged from this district.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Fairplay\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This gold dredge, still floating in its pond just south\r\nof Fairplay, operated from 1941 to 1952. With chains of buckets like\r\nthose in the foreground, it dug gravel 70 feet below water level,\r\ncarving a 35-foot bank above water level; in effect it mined to a depth\r\nof 105 feet. This dredge extracted nearly 115,000 ounces of gold from\r\nabout 33 million cubic yards of gravel (John Chronic photo)]\r\n\r\nAnother gold field discovered in 1859 was in the northwest corner of\r\nSouth Park, along the headwaters of the South Platte River. Several\r\nmining camps were established here. After early production of rich\r\nplacer deposits, claims were consolidated and large flumes constructed\r\nso that gold could be recovered by hydraulic mining. In this type of\r\nmining, streams of water from high-pressure hoses are directed at gravel\r\nsurfaces. The gravels are washed into long sluiceboxes, where gold is\r\ncaught in riffles. Hydraulic mining continued upstream from Fairplay\r\nuntil about 1900.\r\n\r\nIn 1922 a dredge was constructed near Fairplay to process gravel along\r\nthe South Platte and in the valley floor. An even larger dredge,\r\nconstructed in 1941, operated until 1952, when rising labor costs\r\noverrode the narrow margin on which it operated. At the time operations\r\nceased, the dredge was recovering about six cents in gold for each cubic\r\nyard of gravel processed.\r\n\r\nPlacer gold has always been the principal mineral product of the\r\nFairplay area, but native gold also occurs in the surrounding mountains\r\nin quartz veins, and many small mines were developed to extract it.\r\nSulfide ores were also mined; they contained silver, lead, and zinc as\r\nwell as gold. In the Mosquito Pass and Horseshoe Amphitheater areas,\r\nthere is renewed activity now because of the recent rise in the price of\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Silverton\r\n\r\nGold was discovered in the San Juan Mountains of southwest Colorado in\r\n1870. The earliest mine, near what is now Silverton, was located by a\r\ngroup of prospectors sent out by Governor Pile of New Mexico Territory.\r\nSince the site was on Ute Indian land, real mining did not begin until a\r\ntreaty allowing it was ratified in 1874.\r\n\r\nProduction in the Silverton district has been from veins in Tertiary\r\nvolcanic rocks within an elliptical area known as the Silverton\r\ncauldron. Here the volcanic rocks, part of the several thousand feet of\r\nlava flows and ash falls of the San Juan volcanic field, were cracked\r\nand faulted by a second period of igneous activity. Ores formed in the\r\ncracks and fissures.\r\n\r\nIn the 1870s the Silverton district was very remote, and difficulties\r\nwith transportation retarded activity there. In 1882, however, a\r\nnarrow-gauge railroad was built connecting Silverton with Durango, and\r\nthe problem of transporting ore out of the isolated mountain valley was\r\nsimplified. The railway still exists; a train makes daily passenger runs\r\nduring the summer—the only remaining operating narrow-gauge line in the\r\nUnited States. The track follows the Animas River canyon, whose cliffs\r\nand crags are dotted with long-abandoned mines, prospect holes, and mine\r\nbuildings, monuments to the tenacity and determination of the men who\r\nmined here.\r\n\r\nProduction in this district was more than $22,000,000 in gold and\r\n$20,000,000 in silver between 1874 and 1923. New activity is evident\r\nhere, as in other silver-rich areas of Colorado, because of recent\r\ndemand for silver, lead, and zinc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Silverton lies in a remote mountain valley in the San\r\nJuan Mountains. Silver, gold, lead, and zinc have been mined here since\r\n1874. Storm Peak, composed of Tertiary volcanic rocks, forms the\r\nbackdrop; the narrow-gauge railroad track is visible in the foreground.\r\n(Jack Rathbone photo)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Ouray\r\n\r\nOuray was settled in 1875, when gold and silver deposits were found near\r\nMount Sneffels. Since 1877, mines in Ouray County have produced over\r\n$35,000,000 in gold and $32,000,000 in silver. The district is still\r\nquite active: in 1965, mines in this area produced more than $9,000,000\r\nin gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc, about a third of total Colorado\r\nproduction of these metals for that year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A few miles south of Ouray, along Uncompahgre Gorge, an\r\nold mine clings to the slope below the Million Dollar Highway (U. S.\r\n550). Abrams Mountain rises in the background. The Precambrian\r\nUncompahgre Quartzite outcrops up to about the road level; Miocene\r\nSunshine Peak Rhyolite caps the peak. (Jack Rathbone photo)]\r\n\r\nA mile north of Ouray a prominent intrusive stock marks the center of\r\nmining activity closest to Ouray. The richest deposits of the Ouray\r\narea, however, lie about five miles southwest, near Mount Sneffels and\r\nRed Mountain Creek. There, several large mines, including the famous\r\nCamp Bird mine, have operated for many years, extracting ore from\r\nhundreds of veins that underly the surface. Some of these veins are two\r\nto four miles long. They are in Tertiary volcanic rocks of the San Juan\r\nFormation. Quartz and calcite are the common gangue (non-economic)\r\nminerals, and pyrite, sphalerite, galena, and chalcopyrite are the most\r\nabundant ores. Most of the silver is in the galena; gold occurs in\r\nstreaks and nodules associated with quartz.\r\n\r\nAbout ten miles south of Ouray, along the “Million Dollar Highway” (U.\r\nS. 550), the Red Mountain district lies on the northwest edge of the\r\nSilverton volcanic cauldron. It contains a number of small pipelike\r\nbodies very rich in silver-copper and silver-lead ores. Following the\r\nmid-Tertiary volcanism and ore intrusion, surface rocks in this area\r\nwere intensely oxidized: resulting iron oxides now form the gaudy reds\r\nand yellows of Red Mountain and the slopes near Ironton. This\r\nalteration, as well as the fact that much of the area is covered with\r\nfallen rock, stream gravels, or glacial deposits, compounds difficulties\r\nof locating the small though high-grade ore deposits.\r\n\r\nThe Idarado Mine, on the east side of U. S. highway 550 near Red\r\nMountain, used to produce ores from nearby volcanic pipes; now it\r\nproduces from veins some distance to the northwest. The area is\r\nhoneycombed with tunnels and shafts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Aspen\r\n\r\nSilver was found at Castle Creek and on Aspen Mountain in 1879. A group\r\nof prospectors from Leadville, apparently after examining maps of the\r\nGeological and Geographical Atlas of Colorado published in 1877,\r\nexplored along the line of Paleozoic limestones encircling the Sawatch\r\nRange. As they had hoped, they found ores similar to those at Leadville\r\nin rocks of the same age.\r\n\r\nMining began at Aspen in 1880. Here, as at Leadville, intrusion of\r\ngranite porphyry into or near the Leadville Limestone had broken and\r\ndeformed the layers, and ores were deposited in fissures and as\r\nreplacements during cooling of the intrusions. The intricacy of faulting\r\nwhich controls the ore pockets in the limestone is well shown on the map\r\nof Aspen Mountain in Chapter II.\r\n\r\nGlaciation occurred in this area, and glacial deposits cover most of the\r\nore bodies and outcrops so that little bedrock is exposed. Mapping was\r\naccomplished by extrapolating to the surface the bedrock patterns shown\r\nin mine pits, shafts, and tunnels.\r\n\r\nAspen produced some of the richest silver ores in the world, and thrived\r\nas a boom town for most of two decades. In 1888 the value of ores\r\nproduced reached over $7,000,000; the next year it topped $10,000,000.\r\nAfter the silver crash of 1893 production declined rapidly; the last\r\nmines were closed in the 1920s. Total production of silver, lead, zinc,\r\nand copper reached about $100,000,000. There was virtually no gold in\r\nthe ores at Aspen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Creede\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Creede and its mines are located in an area of Tertiary\r\nrhyolite and dacite, light-colored volcanic rocks.]\r\n\r\n  Happy Thought Mine\r\n  Amethyst Mine\r\n  West Willow Creek\r\n  AMETHYST FAULT\r\n  Last Chance Mine\r\n  Del Monte Mine\r\n  Commodore Mine\r\n  Jackpot Mine\r\n  Coppervein Mine\r\n  Bachelor Mine\r\n  BULLDOG MOUNTAIN FAULT\r\n  Kansas City Star Mine\r\n  Commodore Tunnel\r\n  Mustang Tunnel\r\n  Nelson Tunnel\r\n  Exchequer Mine\r\n  SOLOMON FAULT\r\n  CAMPBELL MOUNTAIN\r\n  Holy Moses #2\r\n  Holy Moses Mine\r\n  Ridge Mine\r\n  Solomon Mine\r\n  Monte Carlo Mine\r\n  Mollie S.

It came into being largely as a result of a discovery\r\nby N.H. Creede in 1889. When exploring in this area, he was reported to\r\nhave exclaimed “Holy Moses!” on examining a rich piece of ore, thus\r\ngiving the name to the mine which initiated the rapid development of the\r\ndistrict. By the end of 1892 the Holy Moses and nearby mines had\r\nproduced ore valued at more than $4,000,000. The area was so rich that\r\nit managed to survive 1893’s great decline in the price of silver; by\r\n1920 almost $42,000,000 in gold, silver, lead, and zinc had been mined\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe ores, silver-bearing galena, sphalerite, native gold, pyrite, and\r\nchalcopyrite, are in quartz or amethyst veins in faulted and shattered\r\nTertiary volcanic rocks. Nearly all the ore deposits lie along a complex\r\nsystem of vertical faults, the Amethyst fault zone, which runs more or\r\nless northwest-southeast through this region. Both the faulting and the\r\nenrichment of the fault fissures are believed to have taken place in\r\nmid-Tertiary time, shortly after deposition of the volcanic host rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Cripple Creek\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cripple Creek, on the flanks of the Pikes Peak massif,\r\nhas produced more than $400,000,000 worth of gold. The Sangre de Cristo\r\nMountains are visible in the distance beyond the Arkansas River valley.\r\n(Jack Rathbone photo)]\r\n\r\nIn 1890, two sheepherders stumbled on some richly mineralized rocks near\r\nCripple Creek. A boom developed immediately, for the rocks contained\r\nboth gold and silver. Since then, the area has produced more than\r\n2,000,000 ounces of silver and nearly 19,000,000 ounces of gold.\r\n\r\nCripple Creek has produced almost half of all the state’s gold and\r\nsilver. The ores are located in or at the edge of a large mass of middle\r\nTertiary volcanic rocks which form an elliptical basin or _caldera_\r\nseveral miles across. The caldera, surrounded by Precambrian gneiss and\r\ngranite of the Pikes Peak massif, was probably formed by collapse of a\r\nvolcanic center that had erupted through the older rock. The collapse\r\nshattered the rocks around the basin margin, and subsequent volcanic\r\nactivity introduced mineral-rich solutions into the many faults and\r\nfissures produced by the collapse. Tellurides of gold, silver, and\r\ncopper, as well as pyrite, sphalerite, galena, tetrahedrite, and other\r\nminerals, are characteristic.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Climax\r\n\r\n[Illustration: At Climax, the ore occurs scattered through the intrusive\r\nClimax Granite Porphyry and the intruded Idaho Springs Formation.\r\nVisitors can tour the surface workings during the summer months.]\r\n\r\n    Tertiary dikes\r\n    Shell of Climax stock\r\n    Core of Climax stock\r\n    Ore zone\r\n    Precambrian granite\r\n    Fault\r\n    Dykes\r\n\r\nMolybdenum now ranks as the number one metal mined in Colorado. Over\r\n$105,000,000 of “moly” was mined here during 1969, almost all of it from\r\nthe Climax Mine, the world’s largest single source of this metal. The\r\nClimax deposit is located high on the west slope of Ten Mile Range in\r\ncentral Colorado, about 100 miles southwest of Denver. It is in the\r\ncentral part of the Colorado mineral belt, near the Mosquito Fault, a\r\nprominent structural feature which extends about sixty miles along the\r\nnorth-south trend of the mountains. Rocks on both sides of this fault\r\nare intruded by Tertiary granite dikes, sills, and stocks. The Climax\r\nMine is in a stock just east of the fault, near the axis of a broad\r\nanticline in Precambrian metamorphic rocks.\r\n\r\nOre minerals at Climax are molybdenite, huebnerite, and cassiterite;\r\npyrite is recovered also for the manufacture of sulfuric acid. The ore\r\nis very low in metal content, containing only one-third of a percent of\r\nmolybdenum, 0.005% tungsten trioxide, and 0.0001% tin. The great size of\r\nthe ore body and efficient recovery by modern methods make Climax a\r\nprofitable mine, however. Production has risen each year since the mine\r\nbegan operation.\r\n\r\nUrad Mine near Berthoud Pass is a newly developed near-surface\r\nmolybdenum mine similar to Climax. Nearby at the Henderson Mine the ore\r\nbody is more than half a mile below the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     RADIUM, URANIUM, AND VANADIUM\r\n\r\nOver a large area of the Plateau Province in western Colorado, Mesozoic\r\nsedimentary rocks are locally stained bright yellow, orange, or green.\r\nSuch staining suggests mineralization, and radioactive compounds were\r\nrecognized here before 1900. At that time, however, there was little or\r\nno market for them or for the vanadium frequently associated with them.\r\nWhen Marie Curie required radium for experiments with her newly\r\ndiscovered element, the raw materials were sent from western Colorado;\r\nby and large, though, production of radium from these ores was\r\nprohibitively expensive.\r\n\r\nIn 1905, vanadium was found to be effective in toughening steel. The\r\nVanadium Corporation of America was formed to mine the Colorado ore.\r\nThis company mines a rich zone in the Jurassic Entrada Sandstone, where\r\nvanadinite occurs with carnotite and other uranium ores. In the early\r\ndays of vanadium mining, the uranium ores were discarded with other\r\ngangue materials; now, of course, uranium is produced from them.\r\n\r\nSince 1945, uranium production has been an important Colorado industry;\r\nin 1969 about $17,500,000 worth was produced. Uranium occurs in the\r\nstate in two very different situations. In the Plateau Province, where\r\nit was first discovered, it occurs in sedimentary rocks as patches of\r\npitchblende, carnotite, and a greenish yellow mineral called\r\nschroekingerite. It is most abundant in the Triassic Chinle Formation\r\nand the Jurassic Entrada and Morrison Formations, where it was probably\r\ndeposited by downward movement of rainwater from overlying uranium-rich\r\nTertiary volcanic rocks. Concentrations of uranium often occur in or\r\nnear organic matter such as coal, fossil bone, or petrified wood, so\r\nmines tend to be located along rock layers carrying abundant organic\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nAnother type of uranium ore is found in the Mountain Province. Veins in\r\nPrecambrian rocks of the Front Range and several other ranges contain\r\npitchblende which seems to have been deposited by hot groundwater rising\r\nthrough broken and fissured Precambrian rocks. Often exceedingly rich,\r\nsuch ore is mined in the manner of most of Colorado’s metals. The\r\nSchwartzwalder Mine, a few miles northwest of Golden, has produced more\r\nore of this type than any other mine in Colorado.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    OIL, NATURAL GAS, AND OIL SHALE\r\n\r\nPetroleum and natural gas have been found in large quantities in the\r\nPrairie and Plateau Provinces in Colorado, as well as in smaller\r\nquantities in North Park in the Mountain Province. They generally occur\r\nin porous sandstone and limestone layers, where they have been trapped\r\nby overlying finer-grained, less permeable layers in or near folds and\r\nfaults.\r\n\r\nSeveral oil and gas seeps were found along the mountain front shortly\r\nafter the arrival of the earliest settlers. Near Canon City, on Oil\r\nCreek, a plaque commemorates the first production:\r\n\r\n  Oil Creek—site of the first oil well in the west—second place in the\r\n  United States to produce petroleum from wells. In 1862 ... A. M.\r\n  Cassedy drilled an oil well 50 feet deep. By February, 1863,\r\n  production was one barrel a day. Later, several thousand gallons of\r\n  petroleum were produced by primitive methods, and kerosene and\r\n  lubricating oil were shipped by ox team as far as Denver and Santa Fe.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty miles to the southeast, near Florence, the Cretaceous\r\nPierre shales were drilled in 1876. Oil was found in a system of\r\nintersecting fractures and joints. Some of the early wells in the\r\nFlorence field are still producing, making this Colorado’s oldest and\r\nlongest producing field. It has yielded more than 10,000,000 barrels of\r\noil.\r\n\r\nSmall quantities of oil have been produced near Boulder since about\r\n1900, also from Pierre sandstones and shales. In this area, wells were\r\nlocated by “dowsing” or “witching,” as was fashionable at the time.\r\nSeveral old rigs can be seen near Boulder Reservoir. As at Florence, oil\r\nhas been trapped in fractures of otherwise dense and impervious shale.\r\nSome gas is produced and is used by local farms.\r\n\r\nMore recently, oil was found far beneath the surface in the northern\r\npart of the Prairie Province. Here, in the Denver Basin, oil is produced\r\nfrom several levels in the Dakota Sandstone. The oil has accumulated in\r\nlenses of beach sand deposited along the shoreline of the Cretaceous\r\nsea. The general trend of the shoreline, and of the oil fields, is\r\nnortheast-southwest. The shore appears to have been similar to Georgia’s\r\npresent coastline: a swampy tidal zone separated from open sea by\r\nlagoons, sandy bars, and clean sand beaches.\r\n\r\nIndividual oil pools in the Denver Basin are small, but there are many\r\nof them; they lie nearly a mile below the surface, under much of Morgan\r\nand Logan Counties and adjacent parts of Nebraska. Exploratory and\r\ndevelopment drilling keeps total oil production at about 50,000 barrels\r\na day. Oil and gas produced here is piped to Denver and other Colorado\r\ncities.\r\n\r\nIn southeastern Colorado, oil and gas occur in late Paleozoic limestones\r\nand sandstones similar to those which outcrop at the edge of the Wet\r\nMountains. Prospecting by geophysical methods and by drilling has\r\nrevealed several small, rich accumulations, one of which is thought to\r\ncontain about 30,000,000 barrels of oil.\r\n\r\nThe Rangely field, in northwestern Colorado, is the most productive\r\nfield in the state. Located in the northeastern part of the Uinta Basin,\r\nit is an outstanding example of an anticlinal field, where oil is\r\ntrapped in a large, gentle dome. The shape of the dome shows up well on\r\nthe surface; rock layers can be seen dipping outward in all directions\r\nfrom the town of Rangely. Oil was found by drilling on the crest of the\r\ndome. At first, oil was produced from fractures in the Cretaceous Mancos\r\nShale at less than 1,000 feet depth. Later, deeper drilling showed that\r\noil had also accumulated in the Permian Weber Sandstone, at 5,000 to\r\n7,000 feet. At present this field is producing about 28,000 barrels of\r\noil a day, but the figure is dropping each year as the field is\r\ndepleted.\r\n\r\nOil and gas are produced in southwestern Colorado from the eastern edge\r\nof the Paradox Basin and the northern edge of the San Juan Basin. In the\r\nParadox Basin, oil comes from Pennsylvanian limestone mounds or reefs.\r\nProduction in the Colorado part of the basin has been at most a few\r\nthousand barrels per day; more is produced in adjacent Utah. In the San\r\nJuan Basin, gas and oil are trapped in thin porous layers of Cretaceous\r\nand Pennsylvanian sandstone, between impervious layers of shale. Most of\r\nthe production is in New Mexico, although some oil comes from the\r\nColorado part of the basin.\r\n\r\nThe greatest known potential oil resource in the world lies in the oil\r\nshales of western Colorado. The richest of these shales cover an area of\r\n1,600 square miles north of the Colorado River, south of the White\r\nRiver, and just east of the Colorado-Utah line. The oil shales are part\r\nof the Tertiary Green River Formation, which extends over much of\r\nnorthwest Colorado, northeast Utah, and southern Wyoming. Oily material\r\ncalled _kerogen_ is locked in these rocks, too solid to flow out of the\r\nfine pore spaces of the shale. To free it the shale must be mined,\r\nfinely crushed, and heated until the kerogen converts to liquid oil.\r\nThis is an expensive process, and as yet production of petroleum from\r\nthe oil shale has not been possible at a cost which will compete with\r\nproduction of oil and gas from wells. The United States Bureau of Mines,\r\nas well as a number of oil companies, have sought for more than fifty\r\nyears to discover a less expensive method for extracting oil from the\r\nshale. No doubt at some time in the future a competitive technique will\r\nbe developed, or a growing shortage of other oil will bring world prices\r\nto a level with which present production techniques can compete.\r\n\r\nOil and gas production in Colorado is decreasing at present, even though\r\ngreat efforts are being made to find new oil pools. Petroleum\r\nprospecting and wildcat drilling are carried out in as yet unproductive\r\nbasins in the Plateau Province, in intermontane basins such as the San\r\nLuis Valley, and on the Plains. Known reserves will continue to provide\r\nthe state with significant income for many years to come, and if oil\r\nshale recovery becomes profitable. Colorado’s hydrocarbons will become\r\nthe most prominent of her commodities.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  COAL\r\n\r\nCoal resources of Colorado amount to about 60 billion tons. Only one per\r\ncent of this has been mined. Thousands of tons are now being produced\r\ndaily from large mines in central, southern, and northwestern parts of\r\nthe state.\r\n\r\nColorado’s coal deposits were formed during late Cretaceous and early\r\nTertiary time, when seas were receding from this region and the land was\r\nrising. They represent accumulations of leaves and other plant material\r\nin swamps and flood plains similar to those now found in the delta of\r\nthe Mississippi River and in the swamps of southeastern United States.\r\nAlmost all Colorado coal is bituminous or soft coal.\r\n\r\nCoal was recognized early in Colorado history by settlers along the\r\nmountain front, and was mined west and north of Denver in the 1860s.\r\nSeveral large underground mines still operate in this district,\r\nsupplying local power plants, but production does not compare with that\r\nof the Walsenburg-Trinidad area in southern Colorado or the Hayden area\r\nin northwest Colorado.\r\n\r\nThe Walsenburg-Trinidad region, part of the Raton coal field, has\r\nproduced coal since the building of the Santa Fe Railroad in the early\r\n1870s. For many years coal from these mines moved the Santa Fe trains\r\nand many of the numerous smaller railroads that served Colorado’s cities\r\nand mining camps. The location of the mines helped to determine the\r\nlocation of the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company smelter in Pueblo. Now,\r\nmost southern Colorado coal is used to produce electric power. Many\r\nsmall mines, miles away from the power plant west of Trinidad, are\r\ndeserted.\r\n\r\nA large coal-burning power plant has recently been built between Hayden\r\nand Steamboat Springs, just west of the Yampa River. Here, some of the\r\nextensive coal deposits can be seen in road cuts along U. S. highway 40.\r\nUntil conversion to diesel fuel became almost universal in North\r\nAmerican railroads, mines of this district produced coal for\r\nlocomotives.\r\n\r\nIn the heyday of the gold and silver mines, coal was also mined near\r\nCoalmont, in North Park, and Como, in South Park. Coal from these areas\r\nwas used for fuel in nearby mining towns and ranches, and for the\r\nnarrow-gauge railroads that penetrated the mountains here.\r\n\r\nAt Anthracite, near Crested Butte, high-grade anthracite coal was mined\r\nfor a time. Identical in origin with other Colorado coal, the anthracite\r\nof this region was hardened by heat and pressures from Tertiary igneous\r\nintrusions forcing their way into local sedimentary rocks during\r\npost-Cretaceous mountain building.\r\n\r\nA multitude of other coal camps are scattered about Colorado: Cokedale,\r\nDelcarbon, Coaldale, Roncarbo, Carbondale, and Cardiff stand out because\r\nof their suggestive names. These early small camps are, like their\r\nmetal-mine cousins, largely deserted today.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Sand, Gravel, and Clay\r\n\r\nSand, gravel, and crushed rock rate high among geologic products in\r\nColorado; more than $27,000,000 worth of these materials were produced\r\nin the state in 1969. Highway and construction activities have brought\r\nrecent expansion in the number and size of quarries and gravel pits.\r\nIncreasingly, Coloradoans are insisting that quarries and pits be\r\nexcavated only where they will not mar the natural beauty of the\r\nlandscape, and many old pits are now being filled in. Unfortunately, the\r\nscars left by some quarries—such as that on the Rampart Range near\r\nColorado Springs—are difficult to erase.\r\n\r\nClay of good quality occurs in Cretaceous deposits in many parts of\r\nColorado, most frequently in the Dakota or Laramie Formations. In the\r\narea around Golden, the Coors Porcelain Company for many years mined\r\nclay for use in pottery and low temperature ceramic ware. Scars from\r\nthis mining can be seen along the mountain front north and south of\r\nGolden, and deep clefts within the town, just west of Colorado School of\r\nMines, testify to the amounts of clay that have been removed. Colorado\r\nclay is not pure enough to be used in high temperature ceramics, and the\r\npresent use for it is in the manufacture of common tiles and bricks.\r\n\r\nA recent development in Colorado is the use of Cretaceous Pierre shales\r\nin manufacturing lightweight aggregate for building. The shale is mined\r\nbetween Golden and Boulder, near Colorado highway 93. In the nearby\r\nplant, it is pulverized and then heated in a large rotating cylinder\r\nuntil the surface of each particle fuses. Then the particles are quickly\r\ncooled. The resulting product is much like cinder, light in weight and\r\nyet strong. It can be mixed with cement for use in construction work\r\nrequiring a great strength-to-weight ratio, or made into concrete\r\nblocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Quarrying of Paleozoic limestones and dolomites along the\r\neast flank of the Rampart Range northwest of Colorado Springs has badly\r\ndefaced a prominent mountain backdrop. Recent seeding efforts by quarry\r\noperators are returning the exhausted part of the quarry to its original\r\nlightly vegetated condition, and hopefully, as the quarry is depleted,\r\nthe scar will disappear.

Two of the state’s stones, however—Yule Marble from\r\nthe Crystal River Canyon, and Lyons Sandstone of the Front Range—have\r\nbeen more widely used.\r\n\r\nThe Yule Marble, or Yule Colorado Marble, was produced by metamorphism\r\nof Leadville Limestone in an area intruded by the Treasure Mountain\r\nGranite, thirty-five miles south of Glenwood Springs. This exquisite\r\nmarble, which has graced many famous monuments and buildings (among them\r\nthe Lincoln Memorial and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier), is known for\r\nits almost uniform snowy whiteness and regular, fine crystallization.\r\nAlthough its beauty, massive character, and uniformity made it a\r\nsought-after ornamental stone, quarrying was economically marginal\r\nbecause of the remoteness of the site. In spite of this, nearly\r\n$7,000,000 worth of the marble was produced before the quarry closed in\r\n1940.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pure white marble was quarried for many years at the Yule\r\nColorado Marble Quarry, about three miles southeast of the village of\r\nMarble. (U. S. Geological Survey photo)]\r\n\r\nThe Lyons area, north of Boulder, provides pink, hard, even-grained\r\nsandstone which splits readily into slabs or flagstones. These are used\r\nin the Denver-Boulder area for sidewalks and patios as well as for\r\nfacing buildings. Quarries owned by the University of Colorado provide a\r\nconstant supply of handsome facing material and flagstone for new\r\nuniversity buildings, although in recent years the high cost of stone\r\nconstruction has limited its use on the campus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lyons Sandstone is quarried near Lyons, Colorado. The\r\nsalmon-colored sandstone splits along surfaces defined by slight\r\ndifferences in size and arrangement of the sand grains. (John Chronic\r\nphoto)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Most of the buildings of the University of Colorado are\r\nfaced with Permian Lyons Sandstone, which is widely used for buildings\r\nand flagstones throughout the Boulder-Denver area. The University\r\nMuseum, shown here, was established in 1902, and contains over a million\r\nscientific specimens, including many Colorado fossils and minerals.\r\nExhibits in the Hall of Earth portray Colorado’s geologic history.\r\n(Tichnor Bros. photo)]\r\n\r\nThe Lyons Sandstone was deposited as beach and bar sand along the edge\r\nof a sea which lay east of the Front Range in Permian time. After\r\ndeposition, the sand was deeply buried and compacted. Now tilted up\r\nalong the Front Range uplift, it comes to the surface along the east\r\nside of the range. Only between Fort Collins and Boulder does the stone\r\nhave the desirable combination of hardness, thin-beddedness, and color\r\nwhich makes it desirable for ornamental use. The pink color of the Lyons\r\nSandstone is derived from iron oxides, mostly hematite, disseminated\r\nbetween the sand grains. Dendrites (often erroneously called fossil\r\nferns or plants) ornament some slabs; they were formed by\r\ncrystallization of manganese dioxide from groundwater as it slowly\r\npercolated through the rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Lime and Gypsum\r\n\r\nOutcrops of the Cretaceous Greenhorn and Niobrara Limestones provide\r\nmost of the cement materials in Colorado. A number of plants along the\r\nmountain front, including a completely automated and dust-free one near\r\nLyons, provide the major population centers with millions of tons of\r\ncement each year.\r\n\r\nColorado is richly endowed with gypsum, useful in cement and plaster\r\nmanufacture and for ornamental stone and sculpture. Along the eastern\r\nfront of the mountains, gypsum occurs in the Triassic Lykins Formation;\r\nin the Mountain Province, it is abundant in Pennsylvanian sedimentary\r\nrocks. Particularly high-quality Pennsylvanian gypsum is quarried at the\r\ntown of Gypsum, west of Eagle.\r\n\r\nThe Colorado portion of the Paradox Basin, in the Plateau Province,\r\ncontains immense deposits of Pennsylvanian gypsum. Here, rocks near the\r\nsurface have been pushed up into sharp northwest-trending faulted\r\nanticlines by upward movements of gypsum and salt from depths of several\r\nthousands of feet. The soluble salt and gypsum cores of these structures\r\nhave been washed away more rapidly than the surrounding layers of\r\nsandstone and shale, leaving depressions such as Gypsum Valley, Paradox\r\nValley, and Sinbad Valley, on the crests of the anticlines. Red and\r\nyellow Triassic sandstones and shales, especially the Chinle Formation\r\nand the Wingate Sandstone, dip away from these valleys. Exploratory\r\nwells indicate that vast masses of salt and gypsum are present beneath\r\nthe surface, and may extend to depths greater than 10,000 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       GEMS AND ORNAMENTAL STONES\r\n\r\nMore than thirty different gems and ornamental stones are known to occur\r\nin Colorado. Amazonstone, amethyst, garnet, tourmaline, aquamarine,\r\ntopaz, lapis lazuli, quartz crystal, smoky and rose quartz, sapphire,\r\nseveral varieties of agate, zircon, and other attractive stones are\r\ngathered within the state, mainly in the Mountain Province. Turquoise is\r\nknown at several places in the volcanic area of southern Colorado.\r\nAlabaster is mined along the northeastern mountain front near Fort\r\nCollins and Loveland. Localities of interest to gem hunters are\r\ndescribed in _Colorado Gem Trails and Mineral Guide_, by Richard M.\r\nPearl.\r\n\r\nGem Village, in southwestern Colorado on U. S. highway 160 between\r\nDurango and Pagosa Springs, is a favorite stopping place for tourists\r\nwishing to see or buy colorful and attractive Colorado stones such as\r\npetrified wood, agatized dinosaur bones, chalcedony, and jasper.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 WATER\r\n\r\nAlthough not all aspects of water and water supply are geologic, water\r\nis an important geologic agent, determining the shape of the surface,\r\nthe distribution of minerals, and the location of caves. Water used in\r\nColorado comes entirely from precipitation within the state, as all of\r\nColorado’s rivers flow from Colorado outward toward the surrounding\r\nlower-elevation states.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Surface Water\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A cross section through the Front Range northwest of\r\nDenver shows the redistribution and use of western slope water in\r\neastern Colorado through the Colorado-Big Thompson Project. This project\r\nhas cost about $160,000,000, but it is repaying the investment many\r\ntimes over by providing electric power and increasing farm production.]\r\n\r\nMoisture carried by prevailing westerly or northwesterly winds falls\r\nprimarily on Colorado’s western slope, although at some times of year\r\nprecipitation may come from the northeast or southeast. West of the\r\ncontinental divide, where population is sparse, there is a surplus of\r\nwater. East of the divide, where more than 90 per cent of the population\r\nlives, water is in desperately short supply. The high and largely\r\nunpopulated Mountain Province receives by far the greatest proportion of\r\nprecipitation, while agricultural areas of the Prairie and Plateau\r\nProvinces receive much less. Needless to say, the major problem\r\ninvolving water in Colorado is how to move it from areas where it is\r\nabundant to areas where it is needed.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the state, complex water laws and complicated\r\nirrigation canals and water systems were developed soon after the area\r\nbecame settled. Gradually but inevitably, water resources have been\r\ntransferred from the western slope to the eastern. However, such\r\ntransfer must be undertaken with due regard for the rights of downstream\r\nusers, notably California, Arizona, and New Mexico.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest water movement schemes in the state is the\r\nColorado-Big Thompson Project. Water that otherwise would flow into the\r\nColorado River is piped from Grand Lake through the Alva B. Adams tunnel\r\nunder the high mountains of Rocky Mountain National Park, and into the\r\nBig Thompson drainage near Estes Park. It then travels through a series\r\nof reservoirs and tunnels into the South Platte River basin, where it is\r\nused for irrigation and household water. The water is pumped up the\r\nwestern gradient of this system by electric power produced as it flows\r\ndown the eastern slope. Surplus electric power serves the\r\nColorado-Wyoming area.\r\n\r\nAnother large project is the Denver Water Board’s Dillon Reservoir\r\nProject, in which western slope water collected at Dillon is pumped\r\ntwenty-three miles under the continental divide through the Harold D.\r\nRoberts tunnel to the North Fork of the South Platte River for use by\r\nthe city of Denver. The exit point of this tunnel can be seen a few\r\nmiles west of Grant along U. S. highway 285. This project is\r\ncontinuously growing as Denver’s water needs mount.\r\n\r\nIn each of these projects, engineering geologists played a prominent\r\npart in locating dams and tunnels that would not leak or fail, and that\r\ncould collect and transport a maximum amount of water during the\r\nhigh-runoff spring season for distribution through the rest of the year.\r\nFortunately for geologists, the tunnels and bores necessary to the\r\nprojects allowed them to learn a great deal about the structure of the\r\ninterior of the high mountains, and helped to improve their\r\ninterpretation of earth history in this most interesting region.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for storing irrigation water along the eastern mountain\r\nfront has led to the creation of hundreds of new lakes in the region.\r\nAlthough water levels vary with the season, many of the lakes provide\r\nopportunities for water sports and recreation for the burgeoning inland\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nTwo large dams have recently been built in western Colorado for another\r\npurpose: to control the flow of water in the Colorado River drainage\r\nbasin. Electric power for western Colorado also comes from these dams.\r\nOne of the dams is on the Gunnison River at Curecanti, upstream from the\r\nBlack Canyon of the Gunnison National Monument, and the other is on the\r\nFrying Pan River near Ruedi. The latter was completed over the\r\nobjections of geologists, who believed that the extensive gypsum\r\ndeposits underlying the damsite would cause its failure. Cement pumped\r\ndeep into the rocks in the vicinity has so far prevented serious\r\nrupture.\r\n\r\nThere is strong resistance by conservation groups to the construction of\r\nmore dams on Colorado River drainage, primarily because the Colorado and\r\nits tributaries pass through many irreplaceable canyons, some of them\r\nparts of National Parks and Monuments, that are very much a part of our\r\nwestern heritage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Groundwater\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In the San Luis Valley, runoff from the San Juan and\r\nSangre de Cristo Mountains sinks into layers of sand in the Alamosa\r\nFormation. Flowing along the sand layers toward the center of the\r\nvalley, it provides artesian water for irrigation of valley farmlands.]\r\n\r\n  SAN JUAN MOUNTAINS\r\n  LIMIT OF FLOWING WELLS\r\n  HUBBARD’S WELL\r\n  OTTOWAY’S WELL\r\n  ALAMOSA WELL\r\n  GEORGE NEWSOM’S WELL\r\n  CALKIN’S WELL\r\n  LIMIT OF FLOWING WELLS\r\n  Moraine\r\n  Alluvial Slope\r\n  SANGRE DE CRISTO MOUNTAINS\r\n  Sands, lava beds, gravels, conglomerates, etc.\r\n  Alamosa formation\r\n  Granites\r\n  WEST\r\n  SANTE FE FORMATION\r\n  SANTE FE FORMATION\r\n  EAST\r\n\r\nGroundwater is extremely important to Colorado, especially in the\r\nPrairie Province and the San Luis Valley. Below these two areas lie a\r\nnumber of distinct and productive groundwater aquifers, several of them\r\nartesian. In Otero County, for example, there are five major aquifers:\r\nthree separate Quaternary gravel deposits, the Cretaceous Dakota\r\nSandstone, and the Cheyenne Sandstone Member of the Purgatoire\r\nFormation, also Cretaceous. All these aquifers are characterized by\r\ntheir high porosity and permeability, which allow water to flow rapidly\r\nthrough them. Wells in the younger, shallower aquifers produce as much\r\nas 2,000 gallons per minute; those in the older, deeper aquifers produce\r\nabout eighty gallons per minute, some of it with an artesian “head.”\r\n\r\nThe San Luis Valley supports intensive agriculture, made possible by a\r\ngreat artesian water supply. A thick series of soft interlayered clays\r\nand sands, the Alamosa Formation, slopes down toward the center of the\r\nbasin from the surrounding mountains. Water entering the sandstone beds\r\nat the mountain edges flows through the sand layers held there by the\r\nimpermeable clay beds. By the time it reaches the center of the valley,\r\nit has developed considerable hydrostatic head, and the water rises in\r\nwells without pumping. Unfortunately, both the irrigation water and the\r\nsoils in the San Luis Valley are highly alkaline. Constant evaporation\r\nfrom the irrigated fields has concentrated the alkali near and on the\r\nsurface, rendering some of the land less usable than it was originally.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Caves\r\n\r\nColorado has many caves, most of them carved by underground water in\r\nPaleozoic limestone. The Cave of the Winds at Manitou is the only one in\r\nthe state which has been developed as a tourist attraction. It is in\r\nhighly faulted Ordovician and Mississippian limestone near the mountain\r\nfront, where the faulting, coupled with the high relief, has accelerated\r\nsolution of the rock by allowing groundwater to percolate downward\r\nrapidly. The cavern was probably carved during the Pleistocene Ice Age,\r\nwhen surface water and groundwater were much more abundant than at\r\npresent. Deposition of stalactites and stalagmites has occurred within\r\nthe last few thousand years, as supplies and movement of water have\r\ndecreased.\r\n\r\nSpanish Cave, above timberline on Marble Mountain in the Sangre de\r\nCristo Range, is probably the nation’s highest limestone cave. It is in\r\nthick folded and faulted Pennsylvanian reef limestone, at an elevation\r\nof over 12,000 feet. The cave has many intricate passageways branching\r\nfrom its main vertical tubes and channels.\r\n\r\nFulford Cave, south of Eagle, is in the Mississippian Leadville\r\nLimestone of the northern part of the Sawatch Range. Many other caves\r\nare situated south of Fulford, near Woods Lake, where the limestone is\r\nwidely exposed and highly dissected.\r\n\r\nFairy Cave, northeast of Glenwood Springs, is the best known of the many\r\ncaverns in the Paleozoic limestones that form the southern flanks of the\r\nWhite River Plateau.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In Cave of the Winds near Manitou, Paleozoic limestones,\r\ncracked and tilted by uplift of the Front Range, have been honeycombed\r\nby ground water. Calcite stalactites hang from the ceiling, while\r\nstalagmites grow up from the floor. (Cave of the Winds Company photo)]\r\n\r\nIn the Plateau Province another type of cave is formed not so much by\r\ngroundwater as by weathering of the flat-lying alternating beds of\r\nmassive resistant sandstone and less resistant, thinly bedded mudstone\r\nand shale. Where the resistant layers are undermined, great arching\r\ncaves develop. These are best observed at Mesa Verde National Park,\r\nwhere many of them once sheltered Indian communities. They can also be\r\nseen in Colorado National Monument and along the Colorado River and\r\nseveral of its major tributaries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Along the edge at Mesa Verde, caves in Cretaceous Mesa\r\nVerde sandstone were used for shelter by Indians. Springs near the bases\r\nof the caves, which provided the Indian communities with water, probably\r\ncontributed to the undermining of the sandstone cliffs.

Some are located along\r\nmajor faults, where the rocks are so broken and shattered that\r\ngroundwater can move freely toward the surface. Colorado Springs,\r\nManitou Springs, and Eldorado Springs are on the fault complex that\r\nforms the east edge of the Front Range. Glenwood, Juniper, Steamboat,\r\nand Poncha Springs are on well defined faults also.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Glenwood Hot Springs flow from Pennsylvanian shales of\r\nthe Belden Formation, where sedimentary layers are faulted by the sharp\r\nupward tilting against the south side of the White River Plateau. Behind\r\nthe hotel and on the right can be seen the Mississippian Leadville\r\nLimestone, cut by the Colorado River. (From a painting by William H.\r\nJackson, courtesy of Colorado State Archives and Public Record)]\r\n\r\nMany other springs do not seem to be controlled so strongly by faulting,\r\nbut owe their presence to sources of volcanic or magmatic heat which\r\nexist near to the surface of the ground. Some springs of this type issue\r\nfrom Precambrian granite, or Cenozoic volcanic rock, while others flow\r\nfrom sedimentary rock layers. Waunita Hot Springs and Pagosa Springs,\r\nalthough near volcanic rocks, reach the surface through porous\r\nsandstones and shales of Cretaceous age. Mt. Princeton Hot Springs comes\r\nfrom alluvium but its heat source is the intrusive igneous rock which\r\nmakes up part of the adjacent mountain.\r\n\r\nSprings of another general type are also present in Colorado where\r\naquifers, generally sandstones, are dissected by erosion. These springs,\r\nusually not highly mineralized or warm, are most often found in the\r\nPlateau Province. Such springs are frequent at the bases of the great\r\nsandstone cliffs of Mesa Verde and Colorado National Monument.\r\n\r\nManitou’s carbonated springs, which attract many tourists, have their\r\norigin in the arrangement and nature of the rocks through which the\r\nwater flows. Water from the Pikes Peak region, slightly acid from its\r\ncontact with the granitic rock, flows into the Manitou limestone all\r\nalong Ute Pass fault, which extends from Cheyenne Mountain northwest to\r\nWoodland Park. Descending through channels along the fault, the water\r\nbecomes pressurized. Because of its pressure and its acid content, it\r\npartly dissolves the calcium carbonate of the limestone, and from then\r\non carries carbon dioxide in solution. As the water comes to the surface\r\nat the low point of the fault exposure, near the west edge of Manitou,\r\nthe pressure is released and the carbon dioxide effervesces, just as a\r\nbottle of soda water effervesces when the cap is removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe preceding part of this chapter mentions many ways in which man’s\r\ndestiny in Colorado has been shaped by geologic factors. Early\r\nColoradoans settled near gold and silver placers, later ones near mines\r\nthat produced ores of other metals, or in the towns that sprang up\r\naround the mills and smelters that processed these ores. Our present\r\ndistribution of population is partly a heritage from these first\r\nsettlements, partly a result of later discoveries of oil, gas, and\r\nradioactive minerals, and partly a response to the state’s extreme\r\ntopographic variation, which controls and delineates agricultural areas\r\nand transportation routes.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, man has begun to appreciate the fact that he may\r\nbenefit in other ways from knowledge about geology. A new geology has\r\ndeveloped—_environmental geology_—which may be defined as the total of\r\nall geological conditions and influences affecting the life and\r\ndevelopment of man.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental geology is a broad science, concerned not only with the\r\nlocation of cities and towns, but with the uses people make of the land\r\nand its economic products, and with the relationship between the\r\ngeological character of the land and the present and future location of\r\nroads, dams, bridges, factories, homes, recreation facilities, sanitary\r\nland fills, and even sewage plants.\r\n\r\nTwo aspects of environmental geology which are particularly pertinent to\r\nColorado’s residents are discussed below.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Landslides_ and slumping rock or earth are a frequent menace to\r\nColorado’s development in the Mountain Province. Often activated by\r\nheavy rains or deep manmade cuts, they can cause—and _have_ caused—much\r\ndamage to roads, buildings, and other works of man.\r\n\r\nThe flanks of North and South Table Mountains, near Golden, are mantled\r\nby thick landslide debris; intermittent movement of the individual\r\nslides has repeatedly affected the railroad, irrigation ditches, and\r\nroads. As many as six different slides have moved within a single year.\r\nIn one slide area, asphalt road material is estimated to be thirteen\r\nfeet thick; successive layers of pavement have been laid one on top of\r\nanother to keep the street up to grade.\r\n\r\nLandslides and landslide-prone areas may not be obvious to the untrained\r\neye. Each year buildings and roads are constructed on unsuitable rock\r\nand soil foundations, in places where some degree of land slip is almost\r\ninevitable. Building in such areas is risky, but sometimes worth the\r\nrisk; if condition are less than ideal, risks can be reduced by\r\nspecialized types of construction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Floods_ are a perennial threat to much of the state, because of the\r\nhigh relief of the drainage basins and the torrential nature of the\r\nspring and summer rainfall. Their damaging effects were realized early\r\nin Colorado’s history, when canyons were used as highways and railroad\r\nroutes.\r\n\r\nColorado’s most expensive flood was probably the flood in the South\r\nPlatte River basin south of Denver in 1965, which caused $508,000,000\r\nworth of damage and drowned six people. The losses can be attributed to\r\nman’s failure to realize the significance of the South Platte drainage\r\nroutes and flood plains. Homes, shopping centers, and many other\r\nbuildings occupied—and still occupy, as of 1971—land that has been\r\nintermittently flooded for many years. The following description of this\r\nflood, by H. F. Matthai of the U. S. Geological Survey, may help to\r\nconvey some warning to residents or potential residents of the South\r\nPlatte valley and other river valleys in Colorado:\r\n\r\n“The morning of June 16 was most pleasant, but conditions changed\r\nrapidly shortly before noon. A tornado touched ground 15 miles south\r\nsoutheast of Denver about 1 p.m. Within the next hour, another unroofed\r\n30 homes in the little town of Palmer Lake, 40 miles south of Denver.\r\nAbout 2 p.m., a dense mass of clouds descended and concealed the top of\r\nDawson Butte, 7 miles southwest of Castle Rock; and the little light\r\nremaining faded until it was dark black and frightening, according to\r\nsome people. A nearby rancher’s wife described the intense quiet as\r\nawesome, but the calm did not last very long.\r\n\r\n“The deluge began, not only near Dawson Butte, but also at Raspberry\r\nMountain, 6 miles to the south, near Larkspur. The rain came down harder\r\nthan any rain the local residents had ever seen, and the temperature\r\ndropped rapidly until it was cold. The quiet was shattered by the\r\nterrible roar of wind, rain, and rushing water. Then the thudding of\r\nhuge boulders, the snapping and tearing of trees, and the grinding of\r\ncobbles and gravel increased the tumult. The small natural channels on\r\nthe steep slopes could not carry the runoff; so water took shortcuts,\r\nfollowing the line of least resistance. Creeks overflowed, roads became\r\nrivers, and fields became lakes—all in a matter of minutes.\r\n\r\n“The flow from glutted ravines and from fields and hillsides soon\r\nreached East and West Plum Creeks. The combined flow in these creeks\r\nhave been described as awesome, fantastic, and unbelievable; yet none of\r\nthese superlatives seem adequate to describe what actually occurred.\r\nLarge waves, high velocities, crosscurrents, and eddies swept away\r\ntrees, houses, bridges, automobiles, heavy construction equipment, and\r\nlivestock. All sorts of debris and large volumes of sand and gravel were\r\ntorn from the banks and beds of the streams and were dumped, caught,\r\nplastered, or buried along the channel and flood plains downstream. A\r\nlocal resident stated, ‘The banks of the creek disappeared as if the\r\nland was made of sugar.’\r\n\r\n“The flood reached the South Platte River and the urban areas of\r\nLittleton, Englewood, and Denver about 8 p.m. Here the rampaging waters\r\npicked up house trailers, large butane storage tanks, lumber, and other\r\nflotsam and smashed them against bridges and structures near the river.\r\nMany of the partly plugged bridges could not withstand the added\r\npressure and washed out. Other bridges held, but they forced water over\r\napproach fills, causing extensive erosion. The flood plains carried and\r\nstored much of the flood water, which inundated many homes, businesses,\r\nindustries, railroad yards, highways, and streets.\r\n\r\n“The flood peak passed through Denver during the night, and the\r\nimmediate crisis was over by morning; but those in the inundated areas\r\nwere faced with a Herculean task. The light of day revealed the nature\r\nof the destruction—mud in every nook and cranny, soggy merchandise,\r\nwarped bowling alleys, drowned animals, the loss of irreplaceable\r\npossessions, to name a few types. The colossal cleanup job, which would\r\ntake months, began.”\r\n\r\nHydrogeological studies by the U. S. Geological Survey and Corps of\r\nEngineers give knowledgeable estimates of flood danger for different\r\npopulated areas of the state, and recommend that homes, roads, and other\r\nstructures be placed above likely flood levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GLOSSARY\r\n\r\n\r\nAlluvial fan.
