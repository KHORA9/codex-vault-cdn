First, and especially, my thanks are due to Mr. Meyrick,\r\nwithout whose masterly papers and 'Handbook' but little could have been\r\naccomplished. Next, to Mr. R. W. Fereday, who very kindly allowed me to\r\nfigure many species of which he alone possesses specimens--in itself an\r\ninvaluable assistance. I have also to express my thanks to Messrs. E.

The mouth of these insects is suctorial, the\r\nmaxillæ forming a spiral proboscis which is coiled up between the large\r\nlabial palpi when not in use (see Plate I., figs. 5 and 6). The other oral\r\norgans are rudimentary. To acquire this form these insects pass through\r\nthree very distinct stages, viz., the Egg, the Larva, and the Pupa.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--METAMORPHOSIS.\r\n\r\nTHE EGG.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of _Lepidoptera_ are generally somewhat globular, much flattened\r\nabove and beneath. Some are very elaborately sculptured, whilst others are\r\nquite smooth. They are usually white or yellowish, but always change much\r\nin colour as the contained embryo develops.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LARVA.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of moths and butterflies are popularly known as caterpillars.\r\nThey always consist of thirteen segments, segment number one being the\r\nhead. The head is furnished with several simple eyes (Plate I., fig. 2,\r\nAA), a pair of very short antennæ (BB), and a very powerful masticatory\r\nmouth. The mouth consists of the following organs: The labrum, or upper lip\r\n(1); a pair of mandibles, or upper jaws, working like scissor-blades (2,2);\r\ntwo maxillæ, or lower jaws (3,3), each carrying a jointed organ termed the\r\nmaxillary palpus; and the labium, or lower lip (4); which bears another\r\npair of minute jointed appendages--the labial palpi.\r\n\r\nSegments 2, 3, and 4, which answer to the thorax of the perfect insect, are\r\neach furnished with a pair of legs. They consist of the six following\r\njoints (fig. 2): (_a_) coxa, (_b_) trochanter, (_c_) femur, (_d_) tibia,\r\n(_e_) tarsus, and (_f_) claw. These legs correspond to those of the perfect\r\ninsect. The remaining nine segments of the body constitute the abdomen.\r\nUsually segments 7 to 9 and 13, each have a pair of fleshy pads, which are\r\ntermed prolegs and are furnished on their edges with a row of minute\r\nhooklets (see Plate I., fig. 14, proleg highly magnified). It is these\r\nhooklets which enable caterpillars to hold on by means of their prolegs\r\nwith such great tenacity. The number of the prolegs varies considerably in\r\ndifferent groups and families.\r\n\r\nThe _spiracles_, or orifices of the air-tubes, are situated on each side of\r\nthe larva just above the legs. They are usually present on segments 2 and 5\r\nto 12, but vary {x}considerably in different groups and families. The larva\r\nis provided with a very complete digestive system, which consists of the\r\nfollowing organs (see Plate I., fig. 9): A, the oesophagus; D, the\r\nventriculus; F, the clavate intestine; E, the ilium; H, the colon; K, the\r\nbiliary vessels; and O, the spinning vessels. These last open at a small\r\norifice in the labium termed the spinneret (fig. 2, 5). They supply the\r\nsilken threads which are employed by most larvæ in constructing their\r\ncocoons, and which also serve in cases of danger as a rapid means of\r\nretreat. Many larvæ, which live on shrubs and trees, suddenly lower\r\nthemselves to the ground by means of one of these silken threads, and thus\r\noften escape being devoured by insectivorous animals.\r\n\r\nThe entire growth of the insect is accomplished during the larval\r\ncondition, the increase in size being frequently very rapid. Owing to this\r\ncircumstance larvæ are often compelled to shed their skin, and in many\r\nspecies a very considerable alteration both in the shape and colour takes\r\nplace at each moult, or ecdysis as it is sometimes termed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PUPA.\r\n\r\nThe pupa of a Lepidopterous insect is completely encased in a chitinous\r\nenvelope. With the exception of a slight twirling of the abdominal segments\r\nit is incapable of any motion. In the pupa of _Micropteryx_ the mandibles\r\nand labial palpi are said to be functionally active, but this is a very\r\nexceptional though extremely interesting case. In conjunction with other\r\nevidence it would appear to indicate that the _Lepidoptera_ originated from\r\ninsects with active pupæ. The number of free or movable segments of pupæ\r\nvaries considerably in different groups and genera, and by some modern\r\nauthors it is regarded as a character of much importance in the framing of\r\ntheir classifications. The various organs of the perfect insect are\r\ndistinctly marked out on the otherwise uniform integument of the pupa. In\r\nsome groups, notably the _Micropterygina_, these organs are much more\r\ndistinctly indicated than in others.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--ANATOMY.\r\n\r\nTHE PERFECT INSECT OR IMAGO.\r\n\r\nIn common with all other members of the class, the body of a Lepidopterous\r\ninsect consists of three main divisions: (1) the head, (2) the thorax, and\r\n(3) the abdomen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEAD.\r\n\r\nThe front of the head is termed the _face_, the top the _crown_, the sides\r\nare nearly entirely occupied by the compound eyes (Plate I., fig. 11, AA),\r\nand the lower surface by the organs of the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe _Eyes_ consist of a very large number of simple lenses arranged in the\r\nform of two hemispheres, one on each side of the head. The _ocelli_, or\r\nsimple eyes, are situated on the crown, and are usually almost entirely\r\ncovered by scales.\r\n\r\nThe _Antennæ_ are two jointed appendages attached to the top of the head\r\nabove the eyes. They vary very much in structure. The following are the\r\nterms used in describing the different forms of antennæ in the\r\n_Lepidoptera_:--\r\n\r\n1. _Pectinated_, when the joints have long processes like the teeth of a\r\ncomb. If these are on one side only, the antennæ are _unipectinated_; if on\r\nboth sides, _bipectinated_. (Plate I., fig. 20, bipectinated antenna of\r\n_Nyctemera annulata_.)\r\n\r\n2. _Dentate_, when the joints are armed with slight pointed spines.\r\n\r\n{xi}3. _Serrate_, when the joints have sharp projections like the teeth of\r\na saw. (Fig. 18, antenna of _Melanchra composita_.)\r\n\r\n4. _Filiform_, when the whole antenna is simple or thread-like. (Fig. 19,\r\nantenna of _Epirranthis alectoraria_.)\r\n\r\nThe clothing of the antennæ also varies, and is distinguished as under:--\r\n\r\n1. _Ciliated_, when clothed with one or two series of short, fine hairs.\r\n\r\n2. _Fasciculate-ciliated_, when the hairs are collected into tufts. (Fig.\r\n17, antenna of _Chloroclystis plinthina_.)\r\n\r\n3. _Pubescent_, when the antennæ are clothed with uniform short hairs.\r\n(Fig. 19.)\r\n\r\nThe functions of the antennæ are still a matter of dispute amongst\r\nentomologists. The majority of the older naturalists regarded them as\r\norgans of hearing. The antennæ are almost always more fully developed in\r\nthe male than in the female. From this circumstance many modern\r\nentomologists consider that one of their functions is to enable the former\r\nto find the latter.\r\n\r\nThe organs of the mouth are thus distinguished:--\r\n\r\n1. The _Labrum_, or upper lip (Plate I., fig. 11, _l_), a minute\r\nrudimentary plate situated in front immediately above the proboscis.\r\n\r\n2. The _Mandibles_, or upper jaws (m.m), two minute sickle-shaped organs\r\nsituated just below the labrum, also rudimentary.\r\n\r\n3. The _Proboscis_, or _Haustellum_[1] (c), a tubular extensible organ\r\nformed of the two maxillæ, or lower jaws, which have become greatly\r\nelongated, semi-tubular, and closely pressed together at the edges, but\r\nseparable at the will of the insect--a structure which enables the organ to\r\nbe easily cleansed when necessary, and is extremely interesting as\r\nindicating so clearly the true development of the proboscis from the\r\nmaxillæ.\r\n\r\nThe _Maxillary palpi_ (p.p) are two jointed organs attached to the base of\r\nthe proboscis and very frequently rudimentary, but fully developed amongst\r\ncertain of the _Micro-Lepidoptera_.\r\n\r\nThe _Labium_, or lower lip, is situated below the proboscis and carries the\r\n_Labial palpi_ (figs. 5 and 6), two large jointed organs which are very\r\nconspicuous in nearly all the species and often quite conceal the maxillary\r\npalpi. They are usually regarded as organs of touch, but their true\r\nfunction does not seem to be properly understood. In the _Lepidoptera_ they\r\nappear to protect the proboscis, which, when out of use, is always coiled\r\nup in a spiral between them. The labrum and mandibles can only be seen by\r\nremoving the large labial palpi.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THORAX\r\n\r\ncarries the organs of locomotion, which consist of two pairs of wings\r\nattached to its sides, and three pairs of legs attached beneath, a pair\r\nbelonging to each of the three segments of which the thorax is composed. On\r\nthe front of the thorax there are two flap-like organs covered with scales,\r\ntermed the _patagia_.\r\n\r\nThe _Wings_ vary greatly in shape, but usually they are triangular. The\r\nportion of the wing which joins on to the thorax is termed the _base_. The\r\nfront margin is called the _costa_, the outer margin the _termen_, and the\r\nlower margin the _dorsum_, these being described as situated when the wing\r\nis extended in flight. The angle between the costa and termen {xii}is\r\ncalled the _apex_, and the angle between the termen and the dorsum the\r\n_tornus_ (see Plate I., fig. 1). The termen and dorsum are edged with a\r\nfringe of hair-like scales, termed the _cilia_. At the base of the\r\nhind-wings is generally situated a stiff bristle, or several stiff hairs,\r\ncalled the _frenulum_, the ends of which pass through a chitinous process\r\non the under side of the fore-wing near the dorsum. This process is termed\r\nthe _retinaculum_, and serves, in conjunction with the frenulum, to lock\r\nthe wings together during flight. In the female both these organs are often\r\nvery imperfectly developed, the frenulum consisting of several bristly\r\nhairs, and the retinaculum of a group of stiff scales. In many of the\r\n_Lepidoptera_ both frenulum and retinaculum are entirely wanting.\r\n\r\n\"In the _Micropterygina_, a membranous or spine-like process called the\r\n_jugum_ rises from the dorsum of the fore-wing near the base and passes\r\nunder the hind-wing, which is thus held between the process and the\r\noverlapping portion of the fore-wing.\"--(Meyrick.)\r\n\r\nThe veins of the wings are thus described by Mr. Meyrick:--\r\n\r\n\"The wings are traversed by a system of _Veins_--tubular structures which\r\nserve at once as extensions of the tracheal system, and to form a stiff\r\nframework for the support of the wing. In the normal type of _Lepidoptera_\r\nthe fore-wings possess three free veins towards the dorsum, termed 1_a_,\r\n1_b_, and 1_c_; a central cell, out of which rise ten veins, numbered 2 to\r\n11, the sides of the cell being known as the upper median, lower median,\r\nand transverse veins respectively; and a free subcostal vein, numbered 12;\r\nwhilst the hind-wings differ from the fore-wings in having only six veins\r\nrising from the central cell, numbered 2 to 7, so that the free subcostal\r\nvein is numbered 8 (see Plate I., figs. 3 and 4, assumed type of neuration\r\nof a Lepidopterous insect). In some forms a forked parting-vein traverses\r\nthe middle of the cell longitudinally, and a second parting-vein traverses\r\nthe upper portion, so as to form a secondary cell; but these are more\r\nfrequently absent or represented only by folds in the membrane. In a few\r\nforms there is a tendency to the production of several false veins, termed\r\n_pseudoneuria_, appearing as short branches from the subcostal vein of the\r\nhind-wings to the costa; these are thickenings of the membrane, and are\r\ncommonly very irregular and variable, often uneven in thickness or\r\nincomplete. Sometimes one of these near the base is better developed and\r\nmore permanent in character; it is then termed the _præcostal spur_ (see\r\nPlate I., figs. 8^9 and 27^9). Modifications in the general arrangement of\r\nthe veins may arise through any of the following processes, viz.: (1)\r\n_obsolescence_, when a vein loses its normal tubular structure, becoming\r\nattenuated and reduced in substance, until it appears a mere fold of the\r\nmembrane (Plate II., fig. 60, vein 5 in hind-wings of _Selidosema_); (2)\r\n_stalking_, when the two veins are fused together for a portion of their\r\nlength from their base, so as to appear to rise on a common stalk (Plate\r\nII., fig. 34, veins 6 and 7 in hind-wing of _Hydriomena_); (3)\r\n_coincidence_, when two veins are fused together for the whole of their\r\nlength, so that one appears entirely absent, an extreme form of stalking;\r\n(4) _anastomosis_, when two veins rise separate, meet, and are fused\r\ntogether for a certain distance, and then separate again (Plate II., fig.\r\n23, veins 7 and 8 in the hind-wings of the [F] of _Tatosoma_); (5)\r\n_concurrence_, when a vein rises separate, runs into another, and does not\r\nseparate again, an extreme form of anastomosis; (6) _connection_, when two\r\nveins are connected by a short transverse bar passing from one to the\r\nother, a special form of anastomosis, evolved from the ordinary form under\r\nthe influence of a tendency to lateral extension (Plate II., fig. 28, veins\r\n7 and 8 in hind-wing of _Paradetis_). Vein 1_b_ in both wings is often\r\nfurcate at the base.\r\n\r\n{xiii}\"The type of veins in the _Micropterygina_ differs from that\r\ndescribed above in two essential particulars, viz.: (1) there may be three\r\nadditional veins in the fore-wings, rising out of vein 11 or 12; and (2)\r\nthe veins of the hind-wings are practically identical in number and\r\nstructure with those of the fore-wings, being thus much more numerous than\r\nin the ordinary type. There is also often a system of cross-bars between\r\nthe veins near the base of the wing (Plate I., figs. 22 and 23, neuration\r\nof _Hepialus_).\r\n\r\n\"The structure of the veins can be best observed on the under surface of\r\nthe wing, where they are more prominent. The student should begin by\r\ncompletely denuding of scales a few wings of common species: the wing\r\nshould be cut off and laid on a moistened piece of glass, to which it will\r\nadhere; the scales should then be removed, first from one surface and then\r\nfrom the other, with a fine, moist camel's-hair brush--an operation\r\nrequiring a little patience and delicacy of touch; the veins will thus be\r\nrendered conspicuous.[2] When, however, the student has familiarised\r\nhimself with the general subject, it will not be found necessary in\r\npractice to resort to this process; most details will be easily observed\r\nwithout denudation[3]; where this is not the case (as where the veins are\r\nclosely crowded or otherwise obscured), the scales can be removed with the\r\nbrush on the under surface in the locality of the difficulty only, without\r\ncutting off the wing or otherwise damaging the specimen, which remains in\r\nthe collection available for all purposes as before; with proper practice,\r\neven the smallest species are amenable to this treatment, which does not\r\nrequire more skill than the actual setting of the specimen. Some workers\r\nprefer to put a drop of benzine on the spot, which renders it temporarily\r\ntransparent; the effect is short-lived, as the benzine evaporates rapidly,\r\nand the cilia (if long) are liable to be damaged by this method.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Legs_ consist of the following joints (see Plate I., fig. 21): (1)\r\n_coxa_, (2) _trochanter_, (3) _femur_, (4) _tibia_, (5) _tarsus_, (6)\r\n_claw_. The tarsus normally consists of five joints, but is more or less\r\naborted when the leg is not employed for walking. The spines (SS) on the\r\ntibiæ of the several legs vary considerably in size and number. They are\r\noften useful to the systematist for purposes of classification.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ABDOMEN\r\n\r\nconsists of nine segments, some of which are often fused together. It\r\ncontains the various internal organs, of which the most important are those\r\nof Digestion and Reproduction. The _Digestive System_ (Plate I., fig. 10)\r\nconsists of the following organs: A, the _oesophagus_, or throat; C, the\r\n_sucking stomach_; D, the _ventriculus_ or stomach; E, the _small\r\nintestine_; G, the _cæcum_; H, the _colon_; K, the _biliary vessels_; N,\r\nthe _salivary vessels_. The function of the _sucking stomach_ is to exhaust\r\nthe air in the throat and proboscis, and thus to cause the ascent of the\r\nfluids into the stomach when the insect is feeding.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--ORIGIN OF SPECIES.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the origin of species as propounded by Darwin may be thus\r\nvery briefly summarised:--\r\n\r\n{xiv}VARIATION.--No two organisms are exactly alike; there is always some\r\nvariation from the parent form, in some cases very slight, in others\r\nconsiderable. (For examples of variation see Plate VII., figs. 1 to 9,\r\nvarieties of _Hydriomena deltoidata_; Plate VIII., figs. 42 to 47,\r\nvarieties of _Epirranthis alectoraria_; Plate IX., figs. 6 to 14, varieties\r\nof _Selidosema productata_; Plate X., figs. 13 to 23, varieties of _Azelina\r\ngallaria_; Plate X., figs. 39 to 47, varieties of _Declana floccosa_.)\r\n\r\nINHERITANCE.--Many of these variations are inherited--a fact demonstrated\r\nby our domestic plants and animals, where man has selected and bred from\r\nvarieties suitable for his purposes, and has thus produced races in which\r\nthe variation is permanent. Many of the races of domestic animals differ as\r\nmuch from one another as do some distinct species of wild animals.\r\n\r\nSTRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE.--All animals and plants produce far more offspring\r\nthan can possibly survive, thus giving rise to the struggle for existence.\r\nFor example: The average number of eggs laid by a Lepidopterous insect is\r\ncertainly over 100, and in many species this number is greatly exceeded.\r\nAssuming each female to lay 100 eggs, the progeny from a single pair would\r\namount, after six generations, to over six million individuals.\r\n\r\nNATURAL SELECTION, or the SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.--In the struggle for\r\nexistence which necessarily results from such a great increase of\r\nindividuals, those variations which favoured the possessors would be\r\npreserved, whilst those which did not, would be gradually exterminated.\r\nThis principle of the preservation of the favourable varieties in the\r\nstruggle for life is called Natural Selection, or the Survival of the\r\nFittest.\r\n\r\nDIVERGENCE OF CHARACTER.--As there are so many different places and\r\nconditions in the economy of nature which can be occupied by organic beings\r\ndifferently constituted, individuals which diverged most from the original\r\ntype would be brought into less severe competition, than those which\r\ndiverged only in a slight degree. For instance, if we represent the\r\noriginal form as A, occupying one place in the economy of nature; a second\r\nform as B, occupying a somewhat similar place; a third form as C, occupying\r\na very different place to A although somewhat similar place to B, it is\r\nobvious that B would enter into severe competition with both A and C,\r\nwhilst A and C might not trend to any great extent on one another's place\r\nin the natural economy; hence B would be exterminated before either A or C.\r\nIn other words, natural selection continually tends to increase the slight\r\ndifferences, which we call varieties, into the greater differences, which\r\nwe call species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following phenomena, which have long been observed by students of the\r\n_Lepidoptera_, will serve as excellent examples of the operation of natural\r\nselection:--\r\n\r\nPROTECTIVE RESEMBLANCE.--This term is applied to those classes of form or\r\ncolour which enable an animal to so closely resemble its surroundings as to\r\nescape the notice of its enemies. Numerous examples of protective\r\nresemblance exist in the New Zealand moths and butterflies; in fact, it may\r\nsafely be asserted that nearly all the colouring we observe in these\r\ninsects has been acquired for protective purposes. The following species,\r\namongst many others which will be described hereafter, exhibit in a very\r\nmarked degree the phenomenon of protective resemblance: _Epirranthis\r\nalectoraria_, _Selidosema dejectaria_, and _Drepanodes muriferata_ resemble\r\ndead leaves; _Chloroclystis {xv}bilineolata_, _Tatosoma agrionata_, and\r\n_Erana graminosa_ resemble, when at rest, patches of moss; _Selidosema\r\nproductata_ and _S. lupinata_ resemble the bark of trees; _Chloroclystis\r\nlichenodes_, _Declana floccosa_, and _Elvia glaucata_ resemble variously\r\ncoloured lichens. It is almost unnecessary to point out that all those\r\nvariations, which tended to conceal the possessors from their enemies,\r\nwould be preserved in the struggle for existence, and that these numerous\r\nand perfect instances of protective resemblance would inevitably result\r\nfrom the operation of natural selection. The dark colouration of Alpine and\r\nArctic _Lepidoptera_, which enables them to rapidly absorb heat during the\r\nshort and fitful gleams of sunshine experienced on mountains or in high\r\nlatitudes, is also an instance of adaptation to conditions through the\r\ninfluence of natural selection. This was first pointed out by Lord\r\nWalsingham in 1885. The almost complete absence of white species in these\r\nlocalities is a good example of the extinction of forms unfitted to their\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nCONTRAST COLOURS.--In this class of colouring the fore-wings only are\r\nprotectively coloured, the hind-wings being very conspicuous. Contrast\r\ncolouring is well exemplified by several of the insects included in the\r\ngenus _Notoreas_. The sudden exhibition of the hind-wings during flight\r\ndazzles the eye of the pursuer. When the insect immediately afterwards\r\ncloses its wings and the fore-wings alone are visible, it is extremely\r\ndifficult to see. This form of protective colouring was also first drawn\r\nattention to by Lord Walsingham. (See page 75.)\r\n\r\nWARNING COLOURS.--Insects, which are unfit for food or nauseous, are not\r\nprotectively coloured, but on the contrary are rendered as conspicuous as\r\npossible. This class of colouring is well illustrated by one of our\r\ncommonest moths, _Nyctemera annulata_ (Pl. IV., figs. 1 and 2). The\r\nprinciple of warning colours was first discovered by Mr. A. R. Wallace, and\r\nis graphically described in Professor Poulton's entertaining work, 'The\r\nColours of Animals.' The possession of nauseous qualities would be of\r\nlittle value to an insect, unless it could be at once recognised by\r\ninsectivorous animals and avoided as food. If a nauseous insect were not\r\neasily identified it would speedily be destroyed by what Professor Poulton\r\ningeniously terms \"experimental tasting\"; hence, through the process of\r\nnatural selection, all nauseous species have become very conspicuously\r\ncoloured. It may be remarked that warning colours are extremely rare\r\namongst the New Zealand species, and I am not aware of any other example\r\nthan that already given.\r\n\r\nMIMICRY.--This term is applied to those remarkable cases where a harmless\r\nor edible species imitates in form and colouring a highly armed or nauseous\r\nspecies. No instances of this extremely interesting class of protection are\r\nyet known amongst the New Zealand _Lepidoptera_, but a very perfect example\r\nof mimicry exists between two common introduced species of _Hymenoptera_\r\nand _Diptera_, the well-known honey-bee and the drone-fly. The superficial\r\nresemblance between these two insects is very close. The bee, as every one\r\nknows, is armed with a powerful sting, whilst the drone-fly is unarmed. In\r\nthis case it can be seen that if a harmless insect varied in the direction\r\nof resembling a formidable or objectionable species it would be a decided\r\nadvantage to it, and such varieties would tend to be continually preserved\r\nand improved, through the operation of natural selection. The subject of\r\nmimicry has been alluded to here as it is not impossible that some\r\ninstances of it may yet be discovered in connection with our native\r\n_Lepidoptera_.\r\n\r\n{xvi}ORNAMENTAL COLOURING.--This class of colouring occurs in many species,\r\nespecially amongst the butterflies, and is not apparently connected in any\r\nway with protection. Darwin supposes that it has arisen through the females\r\nof each species always selecting the most beautiful males as mates, hence\r\nthese alone would leave progeny, and the females themselves would\r\nafterwards become beautiful through the effects of inheritance. This\r\nprinciple Darwin has termed Sexual Selection, and has discussed it in great\r\ndetail in his work on the 'Descent of Man.' The fact, that amongst birds\r\nand butterflies the males are nearly always the most brilliantly coloured\r\nand the most beautiful, together with an immense mass of other evidence,\r\ntends, I think, to entirely support Darwin's theory, although it should be\r\nmentioned that several eminent naturalists, including Mr. Wallace, do not\r\nadmit the principle of Sexual Selection.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--CLASSIFICATION.\r\n\r\nFrom a further consideration of the foregoing principles it will be seen\r\nthat all existing species are held to be descended by true generation from\r\npre-existing species, and that, consequently, all the relationships we\r\nobserve between species are explained by community of origin. The most\r\nnatural system of classification is, therefore, that which best reveals the\r\nscheme of descent, or, as it is termed, the phylogeny, of the group of\r\norganisms classified. To construct a perfect system of classification on\r\nthese principles a knowledge of not only all the existing species of\r\n_Lepidoptera_ would be essential, but also of all the extinct species, and\r\nit is needless to say that such knowledge is quite unattainable.\r\nNevertheless large numbers of species are now known from many parts of the\r\nworld, and a very extensive collection has recently been employed by Mr.\r\nMeyrick in framing a classification of the _Lepidoptera_, which is, to the\r\nbest of my belief, the first constructed on strictly Darwinian principles.\r\nAlthough adopting Mr. Meyrick's system in the present work I do not agree\r\nunreservedly with all his conclusions; but I have not attempted to alter\r\nhis system in accordance with my own views, as I conceive that the\r\nconclusions of a naturalist, who has only had the opportunity of studying a\r\nrestricted fauna, would necessarily be liable to considerable error.\r\n\r\nThe general principles on which Mr. Meyrick has founded his system are\r\npractically those laid down by Darwin in his 'Origin of Species,' and may\r\nbe thus summarised:--\r\n\r\nA. Resemblances between all organisms are explained by community of origin,\r\nthe amount of difference representing the amount of modification and\r\nexpressible in the classification as varieties, species, genera, families,\r\ngroups, orders, &c. The amount of difference does not _necessarily_ bear\r\nany direct relation to time, many forms remaining almost stationary whilst\r\nothers are undergoing development.\r\n\r\nB. By a consideration of the following laws the age of a division can be\r\napproximately arrived at; that is to say, its position in the great\r\ngenealogical tree of the _Lepidoptera_ can be, to some extent,\r\ndetermined:--\r\n\r\n\"(1) No new organ can be produced except as a modification of some\r\npreviously existing structure.\r\n\r\n\"(2) A lost organ cannot be regained.\r\n\r\n\"(3) A rudimentary organ is rarely redeveloped.\"--(Meyrick.)\r\n\r\n{xvii}C. The greatest care is necessary to avoid being misled by adaptive\r\ncharacters, _i.e._, characters which are very important to the welfare of\r\nthe species, and hence much modified through the agency of natural\r\nselection. A familiar instance of superficial resemblance, due to the\r\npresence of similar adaptive characters, may be observed in fishes and\r\nwhales, where two groups of animals with but little real relationship have,\r\nthrough living under similar conditions, become extremely like each other\r\nin external appearance. Other examples might be given amongst exotic\r\n_Lepidoptera_. Thus, many noxious species are closely mimicked by harmless\r\nforms which are often far removed from them in real affinity. These cases\r\nof adaptive resemblances abound amongst all organisms, and have often\r\ndeceived experienced naturalists. It is in consequence of the illusive\r\nnature of these external resemblances amongst different members of the\r\n_Lepidoptera_, that the structure of the neuration of the wings is now\r\nconsidered of such great importance as a character for purposes of\r\nclassification. The numerous modifications in the position of the veins and\r\ntheir presence or absence in certain groups can, so far as we are able to\r\nsee, have had very little effect on the well-being of those insects\r\npossessing such modifications. Hence it may fairly be assumed, that these\r\nstructures have been free from the influence of natural selection for a\r\nvery lengthened period. It is thus contended that the neuration of a\r\nLepidopterous insect probably reveals more plainly than any other character\r\nits true relationship with other species.\r\n\r\nThe descent of all the _Lepidoptera_ from some ancient member of the\r\n_Trichoptera_ (or caddis-flies) is thus proved, according to Mr. Meyrick:--\r\n\r\n\"From a consideration of the laws enunciated above, there can be no doubt\r\nthat the _Micropterygina_ are the ancestral group of the _Lepidoptera_,\r\nfrom which all others have descended; this is sufficiently proved by the\r\nexistence of the four or more additional veins in the hind-wings of that\r\ngroup, for these veins, if not originally present, could not have been\r\nafterwards produced. Of the two families of that group, the\r\n_Micropterygidæ_, which possess an additional vein (or veins) in the\r\nfore-wings, and fully developed six-jointed maxillary palpi, must be more\r\nprimitive than the _Hepialidæ_. Now if the neuration of the whole of the\r\n_Lepidoptera_ is compared with that of all other insects, it will be found\r\nthat in no instance is there any close resemblance, except in the case of\r\nthe _Micropterygidæ_; but the neuration of these so closely approaches that\r\nof certain _Trichoptera_ (caddis-flies) as to be practically identical. The\r\nconclusion is clear, that the _Lepidoptera_ are descended from the\r\n_Trichoptera_, and that the _Micropterygidæ_ are the true connecting link.\r\nIf the other marked structural characters of the _Micropterygidæ_ are taken\r\ninto consideration, viz., the possession of the jugum, the large\r\ndevelopment of the maxillary palpi as compared with the labial, and the\r\nsometimes functionally active mandibles, they will be all found commonly in\r\nthe _Trichoptera_, affording additional confirmation. It may be added that\r\nin one New Zealand species of _Micropterygidæ_ (_Palæomicra chalcophanes_)\r\nvein _1b_ is basally trifurcate, a character frequent in the _Trichoptera_,\r\nbut not yet discovered in any other _Lepidopteron_. In most _Trichoptera_\r\nthe veins of the hindwings are much more numerous than those of the\r\nfore-wings, in the _Micropterygina_ they are usually equal in number, in\r\nother _Lepidoptera_ they are less numerous; in the course of descent there\r\nhas therefore been a greater progressive diminution in the number of veins\r\nof the hind-wings as compared with those of the fore-wings, though these\r\nalso have diminished.\r\n\r\n{xviii}\"It is unnecessary to trace back the descent of the _Lepidoptera_\r\nfurther; but it may be worth while to point out that we may assume as the\r\nprimitive type of Trichopterous neuration, a system of numerous\r\nlongitudinal veins gradually diverging from the base, mostly furcate\r\nterminally, and connected by a series of irregularly placed cross-bars near\r\nbase, and another series beyond middle.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is Mr. Meyrick's method of arrangement, which has been\r\nadopted in this book:--\r\n\r\n\"The natural order of arrangement, which is that of a much-branched tree,\r\ncannot be adequately expressed by a simple linear succession, such as is\r\nalone practicable in a book. It is, however, possible to devise a linear\r\nsuccession which shall be consistent with the natural genealogical order,\r\nif some additional explanation can be given. The method here adopted is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Suppose the accompanying diagram represents a portion of the genealogical\r\ntree; then the order will begin at M and descend to K, recommence at L and\r\ndescend to K, and thence to G, recommence at H and descend to G, and thence\r\nto B, recommence at F and descend to D, recommence at E and descend to D\r\nand thence to B, recommence at C and descend to B and thence to A, and so\r\non. Thus the order begins with the most recently developed forms and\r\ndescends gradually to the earliest or most ancestral, which are the last in\r\nthe book. To understand the order in practice, it may be assumed that each\r\ngenus is descended from that which immediately follows it in the book,\r\nunless its actual descent is expressly stated otherwise; such statement\r\nwill, of course, require to be made before every recommencement of a fresh\r\nbranch. This system has been adhered to throughout, and after a little use\r\nwill not be found unintelligible. If adopted in the arrangement of a\r\ncollection in the cabinet, it would be a good plan to indicate the\r\nrecommencement of a fresh branch by a special mark, such as a red bar drawn\r\nabove the first (or highest) species.\"\r\n\r\nPHYLOGENY OF LEPIDOPTERA.

In the latter locality no doubt many interesting species\r\nremain to be discovered, especially amongst the mountain ranges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn employing the book for identifications, the reader is recommended to\r\nfirst refer to the Plates and see if he can find anything at all resembling\r\nthe species he has, and then to refer to the description for verification.\r\nIn dealing with variable forms, it is always well to remember that the\r\n_shape_ of markings is generally far more constant than their intensity, or\r\neven their colour.\r\n\r\nThe purely descriptive portions of the work have been made as brief as\r\npossible, and characters, of special importance for the identification of\r\nspecies, are printed in italics. Those who desire to consult more detailed\r\ndescriptions may readily do so by referring to Mr. Meyrick's papers, in the\r\nTransactions of the New Zealand Institute and elsewhere. References to such\r\npapers are invariably given under the synonomy of each species which has\r\nbeen described by Mr. Meyrick.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned that the figures and descriptions in this work have\r\nbeen prepared from nature, quite separately, and no attempt has been made\r\nto reconcile the figure with the description. This course has been followed\r\nso that any character, which may have been accidentally omitted from the\r\nfigure, will not necessarily be wanting in the description.\r\n\r\nThe figures of neuration (Plates I. and II.) have all been made from fully\r\ndenuded specimens examined under the microscope. They are in nearly every\r\ninstance considerably enlarged. Each drawing has afterwards been compared\r\nwith Mr. Meyrick's description, and if found to differ, a second\r\nexamination of the wings has been made with a view to a reconciliation of\r\nresults. Any important differences observed between Mr. Meyrick's\r\ndescriptions and my final results are in every case specially mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{1}NEW ZEALAND\r\n\r\nMACRO-LEPIDOPTERA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--THE CARADRININA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Caradrinina_ may be distinguished by the following characters:--\r\n\r\n  \"The maxillary palpi are obsolete, the fore-wings have vein _1b_ simple\r\n  or hardly furcate, _1c_ absent, and 5 approximated to 4 towards base. The\r\n  hind-wings are furnished with a frenulum, vein _1c_ is absent, and 8 is\r\n  connected or anastomosing with cell.\" (See Plate II., figs. 1 to 12 and\r\n  14 to 18.)\r\n\r\n  \"Imago with the fore-wings more or less elongate-triangular, termen not\r\n  very oblique; hind-wings broad-ovate.\r\n\r\n  \"Larva sometimes very hairy, usually with 10 prolegs, those on segments 7\r\n  and 8 sometimes absent. (Plate III., figs. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15 and 16.)\r\n  Pupa with segments 9 to 11 free; not protruded from cocoon in\r\n  emergence.\"--(Meyrick.)\r\n\r\nSo far as New Zealand is concerned, the _Caradrinina_ may be said to\r\ncomprise that group of the Lepidoptera formerly known as the _Noctuina_,\r\nwith the addition of the family _Arctiadæ_. Its members are chiefly\r\nnocturnal fliers; the body is usually stout, the forewings are narrow, and\r\n(except in the _Arctiadæ_) mostly dull-coloured, with three very\r\ncharacteristic spots. 1. The orbicular stigma, a round spot situated near\r\nthe middle of the wing; 2. The claviform stigma usually somewhat\r\nclub-shaped and situated immediately below the orbicular; and 3. The\r\nreniform stigma, a kidney-shaped marking situated beyond the orbicular. The\r\nclaviform is very frequently absent, and the orbicular less frequently so,\r\nbut the reniform is an almost constant character throughout the entire\r\ngroup, with the exception of the _Arctiadæ_.\r\n\r\nThere are three families of the _Caradrinina_ represented in New Zealand,\r\nviz.:--\r\n\r\n1. ARCTIADÆ.    2. CARADRINIDÆ.    3. PLUSIADÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily 1.--ARCTIADÆ.\r\n\r\nThe _Arctiadæ_ may be characterised as follows:--\r\n\r\n  \"Eyes smooth. Tongue developed. Posterior tibiæ with all spurs present.\r\n  Hind-wings with veins 6 and 7 connate or stalked (rarely approximated or\r\n  coincident), 8 anastomosing with cell nearly or quite from base to middle\r\n  or beyond.\"--(Meyrick.) (See Plate II., figs. 1, 2, and 4, 5.)\r\n\r\nThis interesting family, although generally distributed throughout the\r\nworld, is very poorly represented in New Zealand. Unlike most of the\r\n_Caradrinina_, many of the included species are day fliers and gaily\r\ncoloured. One of these, _Nyctemera annulata_, is probably one of the most\r\nfamiliar of New Zealand insects, whilst the four remaining representatives\r\nof the family are but seldom seen. To British entomologists the name of\r\n{2}\"tiger moths\" will probably at once recall several conspicuous and\r\nbeautiful members of this family.\r\n\r\nThree genera of the _Arctiadæ_ are represented in New Zealand, viz.:--\r\n\r\n1. NYCTEMERA.    2. UTETHEISA.    3. METACRIAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 1.--NYCTEMERA, Hb.\r\n\r\n  \"Tongue well developed. Antennæ in [M] bipectinated throughout. Palpi\r\n  moderately long, porrected or rather ascending, with appressed scales;\r\n  terminal joint moderate, cylindrical. Forewings with vein 6 out of 9 or\r\n  separate, 7 and 8 out of 9, 10 connected with 9 by a bar. Hind-wings with\r\n  veins 6 and 7 stalked or separate, 8 anastomosing shortly with margin of\r\n  cell near base.\" (Plate II., fig. 3 head, 4 neuration of fore-wing, 5\r\n  ditto of hind-wing.)\r\n\r\n  \"The single New Zealand species is endemic, but nearly allied to an\r\n  Australian form.\"--(Meyrick.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNYCTEMERA ANNULATA, Boisd.\r\n\r\n  (_Leptosoma annulata_, Boisd., Voy.

Inst. xxii. 218.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IV., fig. 1 [M], 2 [F]; Plate III., fig. 9, larva.)\r\n\r\nThis species is perhaps one of the best known of the New Zealand\r\nLepidoptera, occurring in great profusion in all parts of both North and\r\nSouth Islands. It is also common at Stewart Island, in the neighbourhood of\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1¾ inches. _All the wings are deep\r\n  sooty black. The forewings have an irregular cream-coloured band running\r\n  from beyond the middle of the costa towards the tornus._ This band is\r\n  interrupted in the middle, and crossed by several black veins, which\r\n  sometimes almost break it up into a chain of spots. The hind-wings have a\r\n  single large cream-coloured spot near the middle. The body is black, with\r\n  several orange markings on the thorax, and a series of broad orange rings\r\n  on the abdomen.\r\n\r\nThis species varies a good deal in the extent of the cream-coloured\r\nmarkings.\r\n\r\nThe larva feeds on the New Zealand groundsel (_Senecio bellidioides_), but\r\nin cultivated districts it is more often observed on _Senecio scandens_, a\r\nplant having a superficial resemblance to ivy, which frequently grows in\r\ngreat profusion on fences and hedgerows in various parts of the country.\r\n\r\nMr. W. W. Smith informs us[4] that it also feeds on the common groundsel\r\n(_S. vulgaris_) as well as on _Cineraria maritima_. I have often seen these\r\ncaterpillars on mild days in the middle of winter, and full-grown specimens\r\nare very common towards the end of August, so that I think there is little\r\ndoubt that the species passes the winter in the larval condition. At other\r\nseasons there is a continuous succession of broods.\r\n\r\n  The length of the caterpillar when full grown is 1½ inches. It is covered\r\n  with numerous tufts of long black hair, and is black in colour, with the\r\n  dorsal and lateral lines dark-red. There are several large blue spots\r\n  round the middle of each of the segments, and the membrane between each\r\n  segment is bluish-grey. In younger larvæ the bluish-grey colouring\r\n  extends over a considerable portion of the insect.\r\n\r\nThis caterpillar may be readily found, as it feeds on the upper surface of\r\nthe leaves fully exposed to view. Its hairy armour evidently renders it\r\nunpalatable to birds, and hence the secret habits we observe in most larvæ\r\nare absent in this species.\r\n\r\nWhen full-fed it selects a secluded spot, generally a crevice in the trunk\r\nof a tree, where it spins an oval cocoon of silk intermixed with its own\r\nhairs. Here it changes {3}into a shining black pupa, speckled and striped\r\nwith yellow. The insect remains in this state about six weeks.\r\n\r\nThe moth first appears in September, and continues abundant until about the\r\nend of March. It is extremely common, especially during the latter end of\r\nsummer, when specimens may often be seen flying in all directions. Mr.\r\nMeyrick observes[5] that this species has the curious habit of soaring in\r\nthe early morning sunshine, soon after sunrise, in calm, fine weather. He\r\nstates that he has seen them in numbers, flying round the tops of trees, at\r\na height of over 100 feet. I can fully corroborate the accuracy of this\r\ninteresting observation, and have noticed the insect to be most active\r\nbetween the hours of five and eight on fine mornings in midsummer. The\r\nhabit is certainly a very unusual one, as most insects are rarely seen at\r\nthat time of the day.\r\n\r\nThis moth is confined to New Zealand, but two closely allied species,\r\nbelonging to the same genus, are found in Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 2.--UTETHEISA, Hb.\r\n\r\n  \"Head smooth. Ocelli large. Antennæ in [M] ciliated, with longer setæ at\r\n  joints. Palpi moderate, ascending, with loosely appressed scales. Thorax\r\n  smooth beneath. Abdomen smooth-scaled.

Fore-wings with veins 7 and 8 out of 9, 10 connected with 9.\r\n  Hind-legs with veins 3, 4, 5 rather approximated, 6 or 7 connate or\r\n  short-stalked, 8 from middle of cell.\"\r\n\r\n\"A small genus inhabiting the warmer regions of the world.

N. Z. Inst. xxii. 217.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IV., fig. 3.)\r\n\r\nThis species was first observed in New Zealand in February, 1887, when I\r\ncaptured a single specimen in the Wainui-o-mata valley. Since that time Mr.\r\nA. Norris has seen two others near Petone, one of which is now in his\r\ncollection. All the specimens at present noticed have consequently occurred\r\nin a very restricted portion of the Wellington District, though it is\r\nprobable that the insect is far more generally distributed throughout the\r\ncountry than these records would seem to indicate.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1¼ inches. _The fore-wings are white,\r\n  with five irregular transverse rows of oblong crimson spots, alternating\r\n  with six irregular rows of small black dots._ The hind-wings are white,\r\n  irregularly clouded with black on the termen; there are two small black\r\n  spots near the middle. The body is white; the head and thorax are spotted\r\n  with crimson, and the antennæ are black.\r\n\r\nThe larva is thus described by Newman:--[6]\r\n\r\n  \"The ground colour is leaden with a covering of black hairs; there is a\r\n  broad white stripe down the back, and on each segment down the side is a\r\n  double scarlet spot. On the continent of Europe this caterpillar is said\r\n  to feed on the forget-me-not (_Myosotis arvensis_).\"\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand the moth appears in February. Mr. Meyrick remarks[7]:--\"It\r\nis probably only an occasional immigrant. Although a feeble-looking insect,\r\nit possesses extraordinary capabilities of flight, and is sometimes met\r\nwith far out at sea. It occurs throughout Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia,\r\nand the Pacific Islands.\" It is well known to {4}English entomologists as a\r\ngreat rarity, and many discussions have taken place at various times as to\r\nthe propriety of retaining it on the list of British Lepidoptera.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 3.--METACRIAS, Meyr.\r\n\r\n  \"Tongue obsolete. Antennæ in [M] moderately bipectinated throughout.\r\n  Palpi rather short, hairy, concealed in rough hairs of head. Thorax and\r\n  femora densely hairy beneath. Anterior tibiæ with developed spine\r\n  beneath, and apical hook. Fore-wings with vein 2 from 2/3, 6 from point\r\n  with or out of 9, 7 and 8 out of 9, 10 sometimes connected with 9 at a\r\n  point above 7. Hind-wings with veins 3 and 4 almost from point, 6 and 7\r\n  from point or short-stalked, 8 from about 1/3.

N. Z. Inst. xxii. 216.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IV., fig. 4.)\r\n\r\nThis handsome species is at present only known by a single specimen,\r\ncaptured by Mr. W. W. Smith, near the summit of the Richardson Range, in\r\nSouth Canterbury, at an elevation of about 3,000 feet.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings of the male is 1½ inches. _The fore-wings are\r\n  black, with two broad, dull yellow, longitudinal streaks_; between the\r\n  costa and the first streak is a very fine yellowish line, and between the\r\n  two streaks there are three similar lines. _The hind-wings are bright\r\n  yellow, with a broad black band, parallel to the termen, interrupted just\r\n  before the tornus; the vicinity of this black band is tinged with\r\n  crimson._ The body is black; the top of the head, collar, and sides of\r\n  the thorax and abdomen are dull yellow. The female is probably apterous.\r\n\r\nThis species may be readily distinguished from the two following by the\r\nyellow collar, absence of any large spot in the centre of both fore-wings\r\nand hind-wings, and the red colouring of the termen of the hind-wings. The\r\nmoth was taken in February, frequenting a species of _Carmichælia_. It may\r\nbe looked for in the mountainous regions of South Canterbury, but at\r\npresent nothing further is known of its habits.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETACRIAS ERICHRYSA, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Metacrias erichrysa_, Meyr., Proc. Linn. Soc. N. S. W., 1886, 749; ditto,\r\nTrans. N. Z. Inst. xxii. 216.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IV., fig. 5.)\r\n\r\nThis species was discovered by Mr. Meyrick on Mount Arthur in the Nelson\r\nDistrict in 1886. Since that time I have taken eleven specimens in the same\r\nlocality, and have seen several others, but as yet I have not heard of its\r\noccurrence elsewhere.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1½ inches. _The fore-wings are black, with\r\n  orange-yellow markings._ These consist of a fine line near the costa,\r\n  becoming very broad near the base, several elongate markings between the\r\n  veins near the middle, a series of spots near the termen, and a broad\r\n  streak parallel to the dorsum. The hind-wings are orange-yellow, with a\r\n  curved black spot in the middle, and a broad black band on the termen,\r\n  ending considerably before the tornus, and nearly broken a little before\r\n  its termination. The female, according to Mr. Meyrick,[8] is \"wholly\r\n  whitish-ochreous; wings minute, aborted; legs short, stout, well\r\n  developed.\"\r\n\r\nThe life-history is thus described by Mr. Meyrick[9]: \"The larva is wholly\r\nblack, clothed with long black hairs, those covering segmental incisions\r\nbrownish-ochreous. It feeds on _Senecio bellidioides_. The pupa is enclosed\r\nin a slight cocoon.\"\r\n\r\n{5}The perfect insect occurs in January, frequenting sunny, grassy slopes\r\non the mountain-sides, at about 4,000 feet above the sea-level. It flies\r\nwith great rapidity; hence it is generally very difficult to catch.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETACRIAS HUTTONII, Butl.\r\n\r\n(_Phaos huttonii_, Butl., Cist. Ent. 487; _Metacrias huttonii_, Meyr.,\r\nProc. Linn. Soc. N. S. W., 1886, 750; Trans. N. Z. Inst. xxii. 216.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IV., fig. 6.)\r\n\r\nThis interesting species was discovered at Lake Wakatipu, by Professor\r\nHutton.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings of the male is 1-1/8 inches. The fore-wings\r\n  are black; _there is an oblique crimson line near the base_, two broad\r\n  longitudinal cream-coloured lines above and below the middle, and a\r\n  double transverse series of oblong cream-coloured spots near the termen.\r\n  The hind-wings are pale ochreous, with a black crescent-shaped spot near\r\n  the middle, and a broad black band almost touching the termen except a\r\n  little before the tornus. The female is apterous.\r\n\r\nDescribed and figured from a specimen in Mr. Fereday's collection.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily 2.--CARADRINIDÆ.\r\n\r\nThe _Caradrinidæ_ are distinguished by the following characters:--\r\n\r\n  \"Ocelli usually present. Tongue usually well developed. Labial palpi\r\n  moderate, more or less ascending, second joint densely scaled, usually\r\n  rough, terminal rather short, obtuse. Thorax usually densely hairy\r\n  beneath. Posterior tibiæ with all spurs present. Fore-wings with veins 7\r\n  and 8 out of 9, 10 connected with 9. Hind-wings with veins 3 and 4\r\n  connate or short-stalked, 5 obsolete or imperfect, parallel to 4, 6 and 7\r\n  connate or short-stalked or seldom closely approximated only, 8 shortly\r\n  anastomosing with cell near base, thence evenly diverging.\" (Plate II.,\r\n  figs. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.)\r\n\r\n\"A dominant family in temperate regions, especially in the northern\r\nhemisphere, the species being very numerous and often occurring in great\r\nplenty; within the tropics, however, their place is largely taken by the\r\n_Plusiadæ_. The structure is in most particulars remarkably uniform, the\r\nneuration and palpi being practically identical throughout the family. The\r\nmarkings are usually very similar, and the colouring dull and adapted to\r\nconceal insects which are accustomed to hide amongst dead leaves or refuse;\r\nhence this family is not one of the easiest or most attractive to study.\r\nThe species are the most truly nocturnal of all the Lepidoptera; few are\r\nreadily obtainable by day, but at night they are found in abundance at\r\nflowers or sugar. Imago with fore-wings usually elongate, body relatively\r\nstout, and densely scaled. It may be noted as an established conclusion\r\nthat antennal pectinations, if not extending to the apex of the antennæ,\r\nare in this family seldom sufficient to mark generic distinction.\r\n\r\n\"Ovum spherical, more or less distinctly ribbed, and reticulated. Larva\r\nusually with few hairs, often nocturnal, sometimes subterranean; often very\r\npolyphagous. Pupa usually subterranean.\"--(Meyrick.)\r\n\r\nThe family is represented in New Zealand by the following twelve genera:--\r\n\r\n                                { 1.

Inst. xix. 29.)\r\n\r\n(Plate V., fig. 26.)\r\n\r\nThis little species has occurred at Wellington in the North Island, and at\r\nLake Coleridge and Rakaia in the South Island.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1 inch. The fore-wings are dull\r\n  purplish-brown; _there is an oblong black mark at the base of the dorsum\r\n  containing a slender curved white line_; the orbicular is rather small,\r\n  round, margined first with dull white and then with black; the reniform\r\n  is large, oblong, dull white, margined with pale ochreous towards the\r\n  base of the wing; _there is a conspicuous oblong black mark between the\r\n  orbicular and reniform stigmata_. The hind-wings are dull grey, with the\r\n  cilia paler.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in January.

N. Z. Inst. xxix. 283.)\r\n\r\n(Plate V., fig. 31.)\r\n\r\nThis species was discovered at Wellington by Mr. E. F. Hawthorne.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1-1/3 inches. The fore-wings are dark\r\n  brownish-black and rather glossy; there are several obscure dark marks\r\n  near the base; the orbicular is oval, oblique, brownish-yellow, slightly\r\n  darker in the middle; the claviform is almost obsolete; the reniform is\r\n  rather large, bordered with dull white towards the base and termen;\r\n  beyond the reniform there is a very distinct wavy transverse line;\r\n  another line is situated near the termen emitting several black\r\n  wedge-shaped markings from its inner edge. _The hind-wings are shining\r\n  white and iridescent, with the veins black and the costa and termen\r\n  narrowly shaded with black._\r\n\r\nDescribed and figured from specimens in Mr. Hawthorne's collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n{7}ORTHOSIA COMMA, Walk.\r\n\r\n  (_Mamestra comma_, Walk., Noct. 239; Butl., Voy.

It has\r\noccurred plentifully at Wellington, Blenheim, Christchurch, and Rakaia.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1½ inches. The fore-wings are dark\r\n  grey crossed by four wavy, black-margined, transverse lines; beyond the\r\n  outermost of these lines there is a black band running parallel with the\r\n  termen, and beyond this again a broader band of the ground colour; the\r\n  orbicular spot is very minute and dull white; the reniform, which is\r\n  surrounded by a black shading, is large, yellow towards the costa, and\r\n  white towards the termen. The hind-wings are dark grey. The females are\r\n  generally much darker than the males, some specimens having the\r\n  fore-wings very dark brownish-black.\r\n\r\nBoth sexes vary a good deal in the depth of colouring, but the markings\r\nappear to be quite constant.\r\n\r\n  The larva is dark brown, tinged with pink; the subdorsal region is paler,\r\n  there are a series of diagonal blackish stripes on each segment, and the\r\n  anterior portions of the larva are much darker than the rest of the body.\r\n\r\nThe specimens I reared were fed on lettuce, but I expect that the\r\ncaterpillar feeds on low plants generally. It is full grown about January.\r\nThe pupa state is spent in the earth.\r\n\r\nThe moth appears in January, February, and March. It is very common at the\r\nflowers of the white rata, and may also be attracted by sugar and by light.\r\n\r\n\r\nORTHOSIA IMMUNIS, Walk.\r\n\r\n  (_Tæniocampa immunis_, Walk., Noct. 430. _Cerastis innocua_, ib. 1710\r\n  (locality probably erroneous). _Agrotis acetina_, Feld., Reis.

The hind-wings are dull\r\n  grey; the cilia are pale reddish-ochreous tipped with white. _The head is\r\n  covered with scattered white scales_, the thorax is reddish-brown, and\r\n  the abdomen is grey tipped with reddish-brown; _the upper joints of the\r\n  tarsi of the anterior legs are white_.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in January, February, and March. It frequents\r\nthe blossoms of the white rata, where it occasionally may be taken in the\r\ndaytime, but more frequently at night.

The fore-wings are rich, glossy\r\n  reddish-brown with several scattered whitish scales; there is a distinct\r\n  yellow mark on the costa at about one-fourth, forming the beginning of a\r\n  broken transverse line; the orbicular is small, round, and yellowish; the\r\n  reniform is small, crescentic and yellowish, _the space between the\r\n  orbicular and the reniform is very dark blackish-brown_; beyond the\r\n  reniform there is a conspicuous white mark on the costa forming the\r\n  beginning of a second broken transverse line; a third shaded line is\r\n  situated near the termen. The hind-wings are pale brown with a dark spot\r\n  in the middle, very conspicuous on the under surface.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from September till April.

In the South Island it has been taken commonly at\r\nMount Arthur, Christchurch, and Rakaia.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is from 2½ to 2¾ inches. _The fore-wings are\r\n  uniform dull grey_, with a double row of very faint white spots parallel\r\n  to the termen; _the hind-wings, head, thorax, and abdomen are pale grey_.\r\n\r\n{10}In some specimens the fore-wings are quite destitute of markings,\r\nwhilst in others the ground colouring varies considerably, and is\r\noccasionally dull brown instead of grey.\r\n\r\n  The larva is very stout, bright yellowish-brown, considerably paler on\r\n  the under surface; the dorsal line is faintly indicated, the subdorsal\r\n  and lateral lines are dull brown, with a chain of elongate white spots\r\n  beneath each; the spiracles and dorsal surface of the posterior segments\r\n  are black; there are also numerous white dots all over the larva.\r\n\r\nThis caterpillar feeds on spear-grass (_Aciphylla squarrosa_), and only a\r\nsingle individual inhabits each clump. It devours the soft, central\r\nportions of the tussock, and its presence can generally be detected by a\r\nquantity of pale brown \"frass,\" or discoloration, which is generally\r\nvisible near the bases of the leaves. Owing to the formidable array of\r\nspines presented by the spear-grass, this larva can have but few enemies.\r\nThe presence of these spines makes the insect a difficult one to obtain\r\nwithout special apparatus. A sharp pair of strong scissors, however, will\r\nenable the collector to cut off a sufficient number of the \"spears\" to\r\nallow of the insertion of a small trowel or hatchet under the root. The\r\nplant can then be lifted out of the ground, and the larva afterwards\r\ncarefully extracted from its burrow in the stem. These larvæ are full grown\r\nabout the end of May, which is consequently the best time to obtain them\r\nfor rearing. The pupa is enclosed in an earthen cell amongst the roots of\r\nthe spear-grass. The moth appears in November, December, January, February,\r\nand March. It is sometimes attracted by light. I have found it commonly on\r\nthe Tableland of Mount Arthur at elevations of from 3,500 to 4,000 feet\r\nabove the sea-level, where its food-plant also flourishes.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEUCANIA PURDII, Frdy.\r\n\r\n(_Leucania purdii_, Frdy., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xv. 195; Meyr., ib. xix. 8.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IV., fig. 11.)\r\n\r\nThis fine species was discovered at Dunedin by Mr. Purdie. A single\r\nspecimen has also been taken at Wellington.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is from 2¼ to 2½ inches. _The fore-wings are\r\n  brownish-crimson; there are two broad, shaded, yellow, longitudinal\r\n  streaks above and below the middle_; the costa is margined with yellow\r\n  near the base, and the dorsum is yellow throughout its entire length; the\r\n  cilia are deep orange. The hind-wings are dark grey, and the cilia\r\n  yellow.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in December.\r\n\r\nDescribed and figured from specimens in the collections of Messrs.

In the South Island it has occurred abundantly\r\nat Nelson, Christchurch, Lake Coleridge, and Dunedin.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1½ inches. The fore-wings are rich\r\n  reddish-brown; _there is a broad bluish-grey longitudinal streak on the\r\n  costa, reaching nearly to the apex, and a very broad, pale brown,\r\n  longitudinal shading on the dorsum; there is a conspicuous longitudinal\r\n  black stripe in the middle of the wing from the base to one-third, the\r\n  orbicular, reniform, and claviform spots are bluish-grey, edged with\r\n  black_, the transverse lines are very indistinct; the cilia are\r\n  reddish-brown. The hind-wings are dark grey with the cilia ochreous.\r\n\r\n  {11}This species varies slightly in the intensity of its markings and in\r\n  the extent of the pale dorsal area.\r\n\r\nThe moth first appears about January and continues in great abundance until\r\nthe middle or end of April, being one of the last of our _Leucanias_ to\r\ndisappear in the autumn. It is extremely partial to the flowers of the\r\nwhite rata (_Metrosideros scandens_), where, on warm, still evenings, it\r\nmay be often met with in the utmost profusion. It also comes freely to\r\nsugar, and is frequently attracted by light.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEUCANIA PROPRIA, Walk.\r\n\r\n(_Leucania propria_, Walk., Noct. iii.; Gn., Ent. Mo. Mag. v. 2; Butl.,\r\nVoy. Ereb., pl. ix. 4; Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xix. 9.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IV., fig. 13.)\r\n\r\nThis insect has occurred in the South Island at Mount Arthur, Blenheim, and\r\nMount Hutt.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1½ inches. The fore-wings are pale\r\n  ochreous; _there is a conspicuous longitudinal black streak in the middle\r\n  of the wing, extending from the base to about one-third, and a broad,\r\n  dark brown longitudinal shading, slightly above the middle, from\r\n  one-fourth to the termen_; the reniform is rather small, dull grey,\r\n  faintly edged with darker, the orbicular and claviform are very\r\n  indistinct or absent; there is a transverse series of black dots on the\r\n  veins a little before the termen, and another series on the termen; the\r\n  cilia are ochreous banded with brown. The hind-wings are pale grey, with\r\n  a terminal series of small black marks; the cilia are ochreous. The head\r\n  and thorax are pale reddish-brown, and the abdomen is ochreous.\r\n\r\nThis species varies slightly in the depth of its colouring.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect is met with from January till March. On the Mount Arthur\r\nTableland it occurred very commonly at about 3,800 feet above the\r\nsea-level. In this locality it was freely attracted by light, and large\r\nnumbers of specimens were captured by the aid of a single candle, exhibited\r\nat the tent door during mild evenings.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEUCANIA ACONTISTIS, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Leucania acontistis_, Meyr., Trans.

D.\r\nEnys, and is now in Mr. Fereday's collection.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1-3/8 inches. _The fore-wings are dull\r\n  ochreous; the veins are slightly darker; there is a fine, black,\r\n  doubly-curved, longitudinal streak from the base to about one-third._ The\r\n  hind-wings are pale yellowish-grey. The cilia of all the wings are dull\r\n  ochreous.\r\n\r\nDescribed and figured from the specimen in Mr. Fereday's collection.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEUCANIA PHAULA, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Leucania phaula_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xix. 10.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IV., fig. 15.)\r\n\r\nTwo specimens of this insect, \"bred from tussock grass,\" were found at\r\nChristchurch.[11]\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1½ inches. The fore-wings are dull\r\n  ochreous, with the veins obscurely indicated by black and white dots;\r\n  there is a curved series of minute black dots near the termen. The\r\n  hind-wings are pale ochreous, clouded with grey towards the termen. The\r\n  cilia of all the wings are dull ochreous. This insect may be\r\n  distinguished from _Leucania unica_ by its larger size, duller\r\n  coloration, less oblique termen of fore-wings, and simple antennæ in the\r\n  male.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in November.\r\n\r\nDescribed and figured from a specimen in Mr. Fereday's collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n{12}LEUCANIA ALOPA, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Leucania alopa_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xix. 10.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IV., fig. 16.)\r\n\r\nThis species has occurred at Lake Coleridge and at Lake Guyon.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1½ inches. _The fore-wings are dull\r\n  orange-brown_; there are three obscure black dots at about one-third;\r\n  _the reniform is represented by a rather conspicuous cloudy spot_; there\r\n  is a curved series of black dots near the termen.

Ent. Soc. Lond. 1897, 383.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IV., fig. 10.)\r\n\r\nThree specimens of this insect have occurred in my garden at Karori.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1-5/8 inches. The fore-wings are _bright\r\n  orange-brown_; there are several white scales near the base, two\r\n  black-edged white dots at about one-third, _a small black spot with a\r\n  shining white dot on each side of it at the origin of veins 3 and 4_, and\r\n  a series of black and white dots on all the veins near the termen; the\r\n  cilia are orange-brown _tipped with white_. The hind-wings are pale\r\n  ochreous-brown. The cilia are ochreous broadly _tipped with white_.\r\n\r\nThis species somewhat resembles _Leucania alopa_ in general appearance, but\r\nthe wings are narrower and the colour of the fore-wings is considerably\r\nbrighter.\r\n\r\nThe moth appears in December.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEUCANIA UNICA, Walk.\r\n\r\n  (_Leucania unica_, Walk., Noct. 112; Butl., Voy.

The fore-wings are dull\r\n  ochreous with the veins darker; there are one or two obscure blackish\r\n  dots at about one-third from the base, and several faint dots near the\r\n  termen. Hind-wings paler with very pale cilia; _the antennæ in the male\r\n  are moderately bipectinated_.\r\n\r\nThe moth appears in November.\r\n\r\nDescribed and figured from Mr. Fereday's specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEUCANIA AROTIS, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Leucania arotis_, Meyr., Trans.

Thorax and abdomen\r\n  smooth.\"--(Meyrick.)\r\n\r\nThis genus is very closely allied to _Leucania_. It appears to be\r\nexclusively limited to New Zealand, where it is represented by two\r\nconspicuous species. Probably when the extensive mountainous regions of the\r\ncountry have been more fully explored by entomologists other species will\r\nbe discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nICHNEUTICA DIONE, n. sp.\r\n\r\n(Plate IV., fig. 27 [M].)\r\n\r\nA single specimen of this interesting species was captured by Mr. C. W.\r\nPalmer, on Mount Arthur at an elevation of about 4,400 feet.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1½ inches. The fore-wings are dull\r\n  blackish-brown, _darker near the middle; there is a rather oblique,\r\n  white, longitudinal stripe below the middle from about one-eighth to\r\n  one-third; above this there is a very conspicuous, large, elongate white\r\n  mark; this mark has a semicircular indentation above, probably\r\n  representing the orbicular; another indentation towards the termen,\r\n  probably representing the reniform, and below this it emits two short\r\n  teeth-like projections_; beyond these markings the ground colour becomes\r\n  paler, and is traversed by an obscure, jagged, transverse line; the cilia\r\n  are grey. The hind-wings are pale grey; the cilia are also grey. The body\r\n  is dark brownish-black. The pectinations of the antennæ of this insect\r\n  are slightly shorter than those in _Ichneutica ceraunias_.\r\n\r\nThe type specimen is slightly damaged; but the species is so evidently\r\ndistinct that I feel no hesitation in describing it.\r\n\r\n\r\nICHNEUTICA CERAUNIAS, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Ichneutica ceraunias_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xix. 13.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IV., fig. 25 [M], 26 [F]).\r\n\r\nThis handsome species has hitherto only occurred on the Tableland of Mount\r\nArthur, where, however, it seems to be common.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings of the male is 1¾ inches, of the female 2\r\n  inches. The fore-wings of the male are rich orange-brown, paler towards\r\n  the base. There are two very broad, longitudinal, yellowish stripes, one\r\n  on the costa and the other on the dorsum. The costal stripe divides into\r\n  two branches before its termination, one of which is produced downwards;\r\n  there is also a _conspicuous white mark a little beyond the middle of the\r\n  wing emitting two tooth-like projections towards the termen_, and two\r\n  narrow, dark brown streaks near the base of the wing. The hind-wings are\r\n  dark brownish-grey. The head, thorax, and abdomen are yellowish-brown,\r\n  and the antennæ are very strongly bipectinated. The female is much\r\n  narrower in the wings, the ground colouring is dull brown, and the\r\n  markings are all dull yellow.\r\n\r\nThis species varies slightly in the intensity of the markings.\r\n\r\nThe moth appears early in January. It is much attracted by light. In 1891 I\r\ntook over twenty specimens by means of a single candle exhibited, during\r\nthree evenings, {15}at the door of my tent. Prior to this date only one\r\nspecimen had been taken by Mr. Meyrick during January, 1886. All these\r\nmoths were met with over 3,500 feet above the sea-level, so that the insect\r\nis evidently confined to mountain regions.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 7.--MELANCHRA, Hb.\r\n\r\n  \"Head rough-scaled; eyes hairy.

Some of these are\r\nextremely difficult to distinguish owing to the obscurity of their\r\nmarkings, which offer unusual obstacles to clear description and\r\ndelineation. I have, however, endeavoured to point out what, in my opinion,\r\nconstitute the most reliable distinctions; but I fear that amongst those\r\nspecies, where only one or two specimens are known, cases of real\r\ndifficulty will arise. Future investigation will no doubt result in a\r\nremodelling of some of the more obscure species in this genus.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to point out that the genus _Melanchra_ was formerly known\r\nby the name of _Mamestra_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA DISJUNGENS, Walk.\r\n\r\n  (_Heliophobus disjungens_, Walk., Noct. 1681; Butl., Voy.

N. Z. Inst. xix. 16. _Mamestra\r\n  insignis_, Meyr., ib. xx. 45.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IV., fig. 29 [M], 30 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis pretty species has occurred at Palmerston and Wellington in the North\r\nIsland, and at Blenheim, Christchurch, and West Plains near Invercargill in\r\nthe South Island. It is probably common and generally distributed.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1-3/8 inches. _The fore-wings are\r\n  pinkish-brown_; there is a short black streak near the centre of the wing\r\n  at the base, and an irregular, extensive black marking along the dorsum;\r\n  _the orbicular, reniform, and claviform spots are large, margined first\r\n  with green and then with black_; a fine white line is situated parallel\r\n  with the termen, edged with green, and emitting two sharp tooth-like\r\n  markings; beyond this line the ground colour of the wing is\r\n  dark-brownish-black. The hind-wings are dull brown, darker towards\r\n  termen; the cilia are white with a brown line. The antennæ of the male\r\n  are slightly bipectinated. In the female the ground colour is\r\n  considerably paler, the black markings much darker, and more suffused,\r\n  and the posterior half of the reniform is usually creamy-white.\r\n\r\nSome specimens have the green and black markings slightly more pronounced,\r\nbut otherwise there are no important variations.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are deposited in October and November. When first laid they are\r\npale greenish-white, but become dark brown in the centre as the enclosed\r\nembryo develops. The young larvæ emerge in about a fortnight. At this time\r\nthe two anterior pairs of prolegs are very short, causing the caterpillar\r\nto loop up its back when walking. In colour the young larva is pale brown,\r\nwith numerous black warts emitting several long, stiff bristles. It is very\r\nactive, and busily devours the soft green portions of the dock leaves,\r\nleaving the harder membrane untouched. Twelve days later the larva becomes\r\npale green in colour, and moults for the first time, after which traces of\r\nsubdorsal and lateral lines present themselves. Growth then proceeds with\r\ngreat rapidity, and in another eleven days the larva again sheds its skin.\r\nThe last moult occurs a fortnight later.\r\n\r\n  At this time the larva is pale greenish-brown, inclining to yellow on the\r\n  ventral surface. The lateral lines consist of a series of black markings\r\n  near the posterior margin of each segment; the subdorsal lines are\r\n  represented by four oblique black marks on each side of the four\r\n  posterior segments of the larva. The region between these lines is much\r\n  clouded with yellowish-green or pink, the larvæ having a tendency to\r\n  diverge into pink and green varieties. The anal segment is dull yellow.\r\n  The head is brown, with two black stripes and several black dots.\r\n\r\nWhilst rearing these larvæ I noticed that during the daytime they\r\ninvariably hid themselves under the blotting paper at the bottom of the\r\nbreeding cage. No doubt, under natural conditions, they retreat beneath the\r\nground, only coming abroad at night to feed. This habit would account for\r\nthe difficulty experienced in finding larvæ of this genus in a state of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThe pupa state is spent in the earth, and occupies about a month.\r\n\r\nThe moth appears towards the end of January. It evidently hibernates\r\nthrough the winter, as it is often seen very late in the autumn, and is\r\nalways one of the first moths to come to sugar in the early spring. It is\r\nfrequently observed at rest on fences and trees in the daytime.\r\n\r\n\r\n{17}MELANCHRA MAYA, n. sp.\r\n\r\n(Plate IV., fig. 31.)\r\n\r\nA single specimen of this species was taken on the Tableland of Mount\r\nArthur, at an altitude of about 3,500 feet.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1-5/8 inches. The fore-wings are bright\r\n  yellowish-brown, paler towards the apex; there are two broad, shaded,\r\n  black stripes at the base, one near the middle edged with yellow above,\r\n  and one below the middle edged with yellow beneath; the orbicular is\r\n  oval, oblique, edged with black except towards the costa; the claviform\r\n  is rather irregular, dark purplish-brown; _the reniform is very large,\r\n  dark purplish-brown edged with black; there is a large elongate patch of\r\n  very dark brown at the tornus, partly edged first with yellow and then\r\n  with black_; another smaller patch is situated on the termen near the\r\n  middle, bisected by a fine yellow line. The hind-wings are grey; the\r\n  cilia of all the wings are yellowish-brown. The head and thorax are\r\n  purplish-brown, the abdomen dull brownish-grey.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA PLENA, Walk.\r\n\r\n  (_Erana plena_, Walk., Suppl. 744. _Mamestra sphagnea_, Feld., Reis.\r\n  Nov., pl. cix. 17. _Dianthoecia viridis_, Butl., Cist. Ent. ii. 547.\r\n  _Mamestra plena_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xix. 17.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IV., fig. 32.)\r\n\r\nApparently common in the Canterbury district, where it has been taken at\r\nChristchurch and Mount Hutt. In the North Island it has occurred in the\r\nneighbourhood of Wellington.\r\n\r\n  It resembles _Melanchra insignis_ in every respect except that the head,\r\n  thorax, and fore-wings are entirely suffused with green; there is no\r\n  central black streak at the base, and the orbicular, reniform, and\r\n  claviform spots are smaller.\r\n\r\nIt varies a little in the intensity of the green colouring.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are deposited early in November. At first they are white in\r\ncolour, but soon become dull brown, with two concentric circular markings.\r\nThe young larva closely resembles that of the _Melanchra insignis_, but is\r\nmuch more sluggish. It feeds on grasses and other low plants.\r\n\r\nIn about six weeks' time it is full grown, when it still resembles the\r\ncaterpillar of _Melanchra insignis_, except that its colouring is\r\nconsiderably darker, and a number of rust-red spots are situated on the\r\nsubdorsal line. This larva also appears to spend the daytime underground,\r\nonly coming abroad in the evening to feed. The pupa is concealed in the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect may be occasionally found at rest on tree-trunks in the\r\nforest, where it is very hard to discover, as it almost exactly resembles a\r\nlittle patch of moss or lichen. Specimens are sometimes noticed in the\r\nmiddle of winter, so there is little doubt that this species hibernates. It\r\noccurs in spring as late as November, and as the pupæ emerge during the\r\nlatter end of January the insect is about for most of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA LITHIAS, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Mamestra lithias_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xix. 17.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IV., fig. 33.)\r\n\r\nTwo specimens of this species were taken at Castle Hill by Mr. J. D. Enys,\r\nand are now in Mr. Fereday's collection.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1¼ inches. _The fore-wings are slaty-brown;\r\n  there is a broken, black-edged, white, transverse line near the base, and\r\n  another at about one-third; the orbicular is indicated by a conspicuous\r\n  black-edged white crescent, the reniform is large, oblong, white,\r\n  margined with {18}black, and crossed by two grey lines_; there is an\r\n  interrupted white terminal transverse line and a series of black dots on\r\n  the termen. The hind-wings are grey, paler towards the base; the cilia of\r\n  all the wings are slaty-brown.\r\n\r\nDescribed and figured from a specimen in Mr. Fereday's collection.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA MUTANS, Walk.\r\n\r\n  (_Hadena mutans_, Walk., Noct. 602. _H. lignifusca_, ib. 603. _Mamestra\r\n  angusta_, Feld., Reis.

Inst. xix. 17.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IV., fig. 34 [M], 35 [F], 36 [M], variety; Plate III., fig. 15,\r\nlarva.)\r\n\r\nThis is a very abundant species throughout the country.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1½ inches. The fore-wings are pale\r\n  reddish-brown in the male, grey in the female; the markings are black and\r\n  somewhat indistinct; the orbicular spot is nearly round, the claviform\r\n  semicircular, the reniform large and not margined with black towards the\r\n  termen; a line runs parallel with the termen, and emits on its outer side\r\n  a tooth-like mark; inside this line the ground colouring of the wing is\r\n  usually lighter. The hind-wings are grey, darker in the male; the cilia\r\n  are white with a cloudy line. The head, thorax, and abdomen are brown in\r\n  the male, grey in the female. The antennæ are slightly bipectinate in the\r\n  male.\r\n\r\nThis species varies much in the ground colouring of the fore-wings,\r\nespecially in the male, where it ranges from pale pinkish-brown to dark\r\nbrown. The wings of the female are frequently much clouded with dark grey.\r\n\r\n  The larva is rather stout, with the anterior segments wrinkled. It varies\r\n  much in colour; the dorsal surface is usually reddish-brown; the lateral\r\n  line is broad and black; a series of subdorsal stripes are also black;\r\n  the ventral surface is green. Sometimes these markings are hardly\r\n  visible, and the larva is entirely green, whilst occasionally the brown\r\n  colouring predominates.\r\n\r\nIt is a sluggish caterpillar, and feeds on low plants (_Plantago_, &c.)\r\nduring the whole of the spring and summer. It often frequents the luxuriant\r\ngrowth surrounding logs and stones which have long been left undisturbed.\r\n\r\nThe pupa state is spent in the earth or amongst moss on fallen trees. When\r\nthis stage occurs in the summer it is of short duration, but in the case of\r\nlarvæ becoming full grown in the autumn, the regular emergence does not\r\ntake place until the following spring.\r\n\r\nThe moth may be observed on mild evenings nearly all the year round, but is\r\ncommoner during the summer. It is an extremely abundant species, and is\r\nvery often seen resting on tree trunks during the daytime, in which\r\nposition the colouring of both sexes will be seen to be very protective.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA AGORASTIS, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Mamestra agorastis_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xix. 18.)\r\n\r\n(Plate V., fig. 30 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis species has occurred at Wellington in the North Island, and at Akaroa\r\nand Lake Guyon in the South Island.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1½ inches. _The fore-wings are rich\r\n  reddish-brown_, with dull yellowish-white markings; the claviform is\r\n  small, grey, margined with dark reddish-brown; the orbicular is also\r\n  rather small, grey, margined with dull white; the reniform is rather\r\n  large, oblong, dark grey, margined rather broadly with yellowish-white.\r\n  The hind-wings are dark brown. _The antennæ of the male are shortly\r\n  pectinated._\r\n\r\nThis species very closely resembles a dark specimen of _Melanchra pelistis_\r\nso far as the female is concerned, which is the only sex I have had an\r\nopportunity of examining.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in February and March. It is a scarce species.\r\n\r\n\r\n{19}MELANCHRA PICTULA, White.\r\n\r\n  (_Dianthoecia pictula_, White, Tayl. New Zeal., pl. i. 3. _Meterana\r\n  pictula_, Butl., Proc. Zool. Soc.

Inst. xix. 18.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IV., fig. 37 [M].)\r\n\r\nThree specimens of this handsome species have occurred at Lake Coleridge in\r\nthe South Island.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1-5/8 inches. The fore-wings are grey, very\r\n  faintly tinged with pink, the markings are yellowish-green margined with\r\n  black, _the reniform is large, oval, clear white, with a minute white dot\r\n  above and below it_, there is a series of conspicuous black-edged yellow\r\n  spots near the termen; the cilia are grey with a series of minute black\r\n  and white dots at their base. _The hind-wings are pale crimson shaded\r\n  with dark grey near the termen_, there is an obscure grey spot near the\r\n  middle; the cilia are grey. The sides of the abdomen are bright crimson.\r\n\r\nThe moth appears in March.\r\n\r\nDescribed and figured from a specimen in Mr. Fereday's collection.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA RHODOPLEURA, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Mamestra rhodopleura_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xix. 19.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IV., fig. 38.)\r\n\r\nThis species has been taken in the North Island at Napier and Wellington.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1½ inches. The fore-wings are\r\n  greenish-grey, with the markings yellow margined with black; _the\r\n  hind-wings are dark grey_ with a terminal series of small yellow spots.\r\n  The sides of the abdomen are bright crimson.\r\n\r\nThis insect is very closely allied to _Melanchra pictula_, _but the absence\r\nof the white reniform spot and the grey hind-wings, will at once\r\ndistinguish it from that species_.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in May and June. It is decidedly rare.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA MEROPE, n. sp.\r\n\r\n(Plate V., fig. 2.)\r\n\r\nA single specimen of this handsome insect was taken in the Wellington\r\nBotanical Gardens in October, 1887.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is nearly two inches. _The fore-wings are rich\r\n  chocolate-brown, with yellow markings outlined in very deep brown_; there\r\n  is a rather broad broken transverse line near the base; a yellow blotch\r\n  containing a slender curved brown line, on the dorsum at about\r\n  one-fourth, forming the end of another extremely broken transverse line;\r\n  _the reniform is large, finely outlined with brown towards the base of\r\n  the wing and half filled in with yellow towards the termen; between the\r\n  reniform and the dorsum there is a jagged yellow transverse line_; there\r\n  is a terminal series of dark brown streaks and yellow spots, and the\r\n  termen itself is scalloped; the cilia are dark brown. The hind-wings are\r\n  pale brown, pinkish tinged; there is an obscure terminal line; the cilia\r\n  are brownish-pink. The head and thorax are dark brown, the abdomen pale\r\n  brown, with the crests darker.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA PELISTIS, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Mamestra pelistis_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xix. 20.)\r\n\r\n(Plate V., fig. 3 [M], 4 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis species has occurred at Wellington and at Paikakariki, in the North\r\nIsland. In the South Island it has been found at Akaroa and Lake Coleridge.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1½ inches. The fore-wings are dull\r\n  ochreous more or less shaded with dark reddish-brown, _especially in the\r\n  vicinity of the transverse lines_; there are several obscure pale marks\r\n  near the base; _the orbicular is grey, margined towards the dorsum with a\r\n  conspicuous white or dull yellow crescentic line; the claviform is small,\r\n  round, dull grey, edged with darker; the reniform is large, darker grey,\r\n  paler towards the costa, margined with {20}white or dull yellow towards\r\n  the base of the wing and termen_; there are two obscure transverse lines,\r\n  the outer one often being slightly toothed towards the termen; sometimes\r\n  there is a terminal series of minute black marks; the cilia are brown.\r\n  The hind-wings are dark grey, with the cilia white.\r\n\r\nThis species varies considerably in the ground colouring of the fore-wings.\r\nIn some specimens the wing is almost entirely rich reddish-brown, whilst in\r\nothers this colouring is confined to the vicinity of the stigmata and\r\ntransverse lines. Numerous intermediate varieties exist which seem to\r\nconnect these two forms.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in January, February, and March. It is very\r\ncommon in the Wellington Botanical Gardens on the white rata blossoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA PROTEASTIS, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Mamestra vitiosa_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xix. 20 (nec Butl.).\r\n_Mamestra proteastis_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xx. 45.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IV., fig. 40 [M].)\r\n\r\nThis insect is very common in the neighbourhood of Christchurch.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1¼ inches. The fore-wings are dark\r\n  chocolate-brown; there are several very obscure marks near the base, the\r\n  orbicular and claviform spots are almost invisible, the reniform is pale\r\n  brown with a minute dot above and below it towards the termen, followed\r\n  by a pale, darker-margined, transverse line. The hind-wings are dull\r\n  brownish-grey, with the cilia paler. The female is rather darker in\r\n  colour than the male.\r\n\r\n  This is a very obscurely marked insect, closely allied to the next\r\n  species, from which it can only be distinguished with difficulty. _Its\r\n  somewhat smaller size and the two minute white dots on the reniform\r\n  stigma appear to be the most definite characteristics._\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in May and June.\r\n\r\nDescribed and figured from specimens in Mr. Fereday's collection.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA VITIOSA, Butl.\r\n\r\n  (_Apamea vitiosa_, Butl., Proc.

Inst., xx. 45.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IV., fig. 42; Plate III., fig. 16, larva.)\r\n\r\nThis is a scarce species in the neighbourhood of Wellington. In\r\nChristchurch it is very common.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1-3/8 inches. In general colouration it\r\n  closely resembles the preceding insect, but is considerably paler, with\r\n  the markings much more distinct. There are no clear white dots above or\r\n  below the reniform stigma, the orbicular is obliquely oval and rather\r\n  conspicuous, and the claviform is strongly margined with black.\r\n\r\n  The larva is rather robust, very pale green above with numerous white\r\n  lines and dots; dark green beneath with yellow dots. In the light part\r\n  there is a triangle of black spots on each segment. The young larva has a\r\n  strong pink lateral line, but in mature specimens this line is confined\r\n  to the anterior and posterior segments only. Length when full grown about\r\n  1¼ inches.\r\n\r\nThis caterpillar feeds on _Melicope simplex_, and when amongst the foliage\r\nof its food-plant it is extremely hard to detect, owing to its protective\r\ncolouring and sluggish habits. The larva is full grown about October.\r\n\r\nThe pupa is enclosed in a light cocoon on the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from November till April.\r\n\r\n\r\n{21}MELANCHRA DIATMETA, Meyr.[15]\r\n\r\n(Plate V., fig. 5.)\r\n\r\nThis species has occurred at Wellington.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1-3/8 inches. The fore-wings are\r\n  reddish-brown; there is a short longitudinal black streak near the base,\r\n  an obscure yellow transverse line at about one-fourth, and several short\r\n  oblique brown or yellow marks on the costa; the orbicular is oval oblique\r\n  outlined very distinctly in yellow; the reniform is white, margined with\r\n  yellow towards the base of the wing; _there is a black longitudinal\r\n  streak at the base on the dorsum, which bends upwards at about\r\n  one-fourth, and runs in a somewhat curved direction to a little above the\r\n  tornus_. The veins are faintly marked in black, and there are several\r\n  large yellow dots between the veins near the termen; the termen itself is\r\n  slightly indented, the cilia are reddish-brown. The hind-wings are\r\n  greyish-brown with the cilia reddish. There are two very conspicuous\r\n  curved yellowish stripes on each side of the thorax.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in September and October. It is a rare species.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA TARTAREA, Butl.\r\n\r\n(_Graphiphora tartarea_, Butl., Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1877, 384, pl.\r\nxlii. 2. _Mamestra tartarea_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xix. 21.)\r\n\r\n(Plate V., fig. 6.)\r\n\r\nThis species has occurred on the Murimutu Plains in the North Island. In\r\nthe South Island it is a common species in the neighbourhood of\r\nChristchurch.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1½ inches. The fore-wings are dark\r\n  chocolate-brown; there is a short, dark-margined, pale transverse line\r\n  near the base, and another at about one-third, the claviform spot is\r\n  small, oval, dark brown, margined with black, the orbicular and reniform\r\n  are very large, pale brown and very conspicuous; _there is a broad pale\r\n  brown terminal band, and a narrow shading of pale brown along the\r\n  dorsum_. The hind-wings are dark grey and the cilia dull white.\r\n\r\nThis species can easily be recognised by the pale terminal band of the\r\nfore-wings.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in March and April.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA HOMOSCIA, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Mamestra homoscia_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xix. 21.)\r\n\r\n(Plate V., fig. 7; Plate III., fig. 10, larva.)|.\r\n\r\nThis dull-looking species has hitherto only occurred in the Wellington\r\ndistrict, where it seems to be fairly common.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1-3/8 inches. The fore-wings are\r\n  uniform dark grey; the veins are marked with a series of white dots,\r\n  preceded and followed by black marks; the orbicular, reniform, and\r\n  claviform spots are scarcely visible; an indistinct wavy line runs\r\n  parallel with the termen. The hind-wings are grey; the cilia are white\r\n  with a cloudy line. The head, thorax, and abdomen are grey.\r\n\r\n  Sometimes the grey colouring is very much darker, and a faint wavy line\r\n  is present between the orbicular spot and the base of the wing. In other\r\n  respects the species does not vary.\r\n\r\n  The larva is rather attenuated and black in colour; the dorsal line is\r\n  narrow and bright yellow; the subdorsal is broader and white; and the\r\n  lateral line is pale brown. The head, legs, prolegs, and under surface\r\n  are pale brown, speckled with black; the spiracles are pink; a\r\n  conspicuous white spot is situated above the spiracles.\r\n\r\nThis caterpillar feeds on the Tauhinu (_Pomaderris ericifolia_) in December\r\nand January. It is very active in its habits, and immediately drops to the\r\nground when disturbed. It is much infested by a dipterous parasite. The\r\npupa state is spent in the earth and lasts about six weeks.\r\n\r\nThe moth appears in February, March, and April. It is attracted by light,\r\nand in consequence often enters houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n{22}MELANCHRA OMICRON, n. sp.\r\n\r\n(Plate V., fig. 42.)\r\n\r\nThis species was discovered at Wellington by Mr. A. Norris.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1½ inches. The fore-wings are pale\r\n  olive-green, mottled and striped with dull grey; there is a double\r\n  transverse line near the base, another at about one-fourth, and another\r\n  at about one-half, passing between the orbicular and the reniform; beyond\r\n  this there are two indistinct shaded lines, and a terminal series of\r\n  black marks; _the orbicular is large, almost circular, and sharply\r\n  outlined in black_; the claviform is small and indistinct, and the\r\n  reniform ill-defined, obscurely outlined in black towards the base. The\r\n  hind-wings are brownish-grey, darker towards the termen.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in November.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA COMPOSITA, Gn.\r\n\r\n  (_Cloantha composita_, Gn., Noct. vi. 114. _Auchmis composita_, Walk.,\r\n  Noct. 616; Butl., Voy.

Inst. xix. 22.)\r\n\r\n(Plate V., fig. 8 [M], 9 [F]; Plate III., fig. 7, larva.)\r\n\r\nOne of the most abundant of our night-flying moths, occurring in great\r\nprofusion throughout the country.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1½ inches. The fore-wings are pale\r\n  reddish-brown, darker towards the middle. There are two elongate,\r\n  pointed, white markings touching the termen below the middle, and a\r\n  central white streak, interrupted in the middle, by a small semicircular\r\n  white mark, which represents the lower portion of the reniform spot; the\r\n  orbicular and claviform spots are obsolete. The hind-wings are dark grey.\r\n  The head and thorax are reddish-brown, and the abdomen is dark grey. The\r\n  antennæ are serrate in the male but simple in the female. In some\r\n  specimens the white markings are more extensive than usual, but otherwise\r\n  there are no important variations.\r\n\r\n  The larva is bright reddish-brown; the dorsal stripe is broad and black;\r\n  the subdorsal narrower, edged with white; the lateral lines are dull red,\r\n  white, and black; the ventral surface, head, legs, and prolegs are\r\n  greenish-grey with black markings; the spiracles are black.\r\n\r\nThis caterpillar varies considerably in the intensity of the light and dark\r\nmarkings. It feeds on grasses in January and September, and is very active.\r\nIt often occurs in prodigious numbers, and at such times may frequently be\r\nseen travelling at a great rate over bare ground in search of food. Amongst\r\nthe grass it is hard to detect, as the striped colouring is very protective\r\nin that situation.\r\n\r\nThe pupa state is spent in the earth, or under moss on fallen trees.\r\n\r\nThe moth appears from September till April. It is double-brooded. A few of\r\nthe second brood emerge in the autumn and hibernate as moths, but the\r\nmajority pass the winter in the pupa state. Hence we sometimes meet with\r\nspecimens on mild evenings in the middle of winter.\r\n\r\nThis insect is much attracted by light, and occasionally assembles in vast\r\nnumbers round a brilliant lamp. I have had as many as one hundred specimens\r\nin my verandah at Karori, attracted during two or three hours. It is by far\r\nthe commonest insect at the collectors' sugar, the numerous visitors of\r\nthis species eagerly jostling each other in their haste to obtain a share\r\nof the sweets. _M. composita_ is likewise observed in the utmost profusion\r\non attractive flowers of all kinds, crowding out the rarer and more\r\naristocratic species. Mr. Hanify has drawn my attention to the remarkable\r\nhabit this insect has of suddenly stopping {23}during its flight, and thus\r\neluding pursuit. It also takes wing with unusual rapidity. Specimens of\r\nthis moth may constantly be observed at rest in various situations during\r\nthe daytime, when the protective character of the colouring will be at once\r\napparent, especially when the insect is partially concealed amongst grass.\r\nMr. Meyrick informs us that this species is common in Tasmania and\r\nSouth-Eastern Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA STEROPASTIS, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Mamestra steropastis_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xix. 22.)\r\n\r\n(Plate V., fig. 10 [M], 11 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis insect has occurred in the North Island at Napier. In the South Island\r\nit has been taken at Blenheim and Christchurch, but does not seem to be a\r\ncommon species anywhere.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is from 1¼ to 1½ inches. In general appearance\r\n  it somewhat resembles the preceding species, from which it may chiefly be\r\n  distinguished by the absence of the sharp white central line and\r\n  conspicuous tooth-like markings near the termen. _There is also a minute\r\n  white dot situated at the junction of veins 3 and 4 of the fore-wings._\r\n  The hind-wings are dark grey.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from November till February.\r\n\r\nDescribed and figured from Mr. Fereday's specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA INFENSA, Walk.\r\n\r\n(_Orthosia infensa_, Walk. 748. _Mamestra arachnias_, Meyr., Trans.

Norris.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings of the [M] is 1-5/8 inches, of the [F] 1½\r\n  inches. The fore-wings of the male are _warm brown, darker towards the\r\n  base_; there is a wavy, white-edged, black, transverse line at about\r\n  one-fifth, followed by a round black spot; _the costa is yellowish, with\r\n  four pairs of short oblique black marks_; the orbicular is large, oval,\r\n  oblique, pale yellowish-brown slightly darker in the middle; the\r\n  claviform is small, obscure, and brownish-black; the reniform is black,\r\n  outlined with dull white; _there is a series of very acute, dull white,\r\n  tooth-like terminal markings_, and the termen itself is slightly\r\n  scalloped; the cilia are dark brown. The hind-wings are grey with a\r\n  series of small dark marks on the termen; the cilia are reddish-ochreous.\r\n  The head and anterior portion of the thorax are reddish-ochreous; the\r\n  rest of the thorax is rich brown, and there is a conspicuous black\r\n  transverse line between the pale and dark colouring; the abdomen is\r\n  reddish-ochreous with the crests reddish-brown. The female is much darker\r\n  and duller than the male, the markings are much less distinct, there are\r\n  several additional jagged transverse lines, and the white markings of the\r\n  male are indistinctly indicated in drab.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in March.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA DOTATA, Walk.\r\n\r\n(_Dasypolia dotata_, Walk., Noct. 522. _Mamestra dotata_, Meyr., Trans. N.\r\nZ. Inst. xix. 24.)\r\n\r\n(Plate V., fig. 16.)\r\n\r\nThis species has occurred at Nelson.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1½ inches. The fore-wings are very dark\r\n  brownish-black; there are several obscure black marks near the base; _the\r\n  orbicular is large, oblong, finely margined with black, the claviform is\r\n  triangular, also finely margined with black, both orbicular and claviform\r\n  are surrounded by a conspicuous black shading; the reniform is large\r\n  ear-shaped, white towards the termen and dark brown towards the base of\r\n  the wing_, the white portion is traversed by a curved brownish line;\r\n  there is a curved transverse line near the termen, the space immediately\r\n  inside this line being paler than the rest of the wing; there is a\r\n  terminal series of obscure pale dots. The hind-wings are dark brown,\r\n  paler towards the base; the cilia are also brown.\r\n\r\nA single specimen of this insect was reared from a pupa found at Wakapuaka,\r\nnear Nelson. Mr. Fereday also has a specimen, but without note of locality.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA ASTEROPE, n. sp.\r\n\r\n(Plate V., fig. 15.)\r\n\r\nA single specimen of this insect was taken at light on the Tableland of\r\nMount Arthur, in January 1891, at about 3,600 feet above the sea-level.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1-3/8 inches. The fore-wings are dull brown\r\n  _with a pale area on the dorsum near the base, and a very broad pale band\r\n  just before the termen_; there is a broken {25}black-edged transverse\r\n  line near the base, and a fainter transverse line at about one-third; the\r\n  orbicular is oblong, the claviform crescentic, _and the reniform oblong,\r\n  white, and very conspicuous_, all are strongly outlined in black; there\r\n  is a shaded transverse line on each side of the broad pale terminal band;\r\n  the termen is dark brown; the cilia are brown, and the veins are marked\r\n  in black. The hind-wings are pale grey; there is a rather conspicuous\r\n  dark crescent in the middle, and two shaded transverse lines; the cilia\r\n  are grey.\r\n\r\nThis species is evidently allied to _Melanchra dotata_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA STIPATA, Walk.\r\n\r\n(_Xylina stipata_, Walk., Suppl. 753. _Mamestra stipata_, Meyr., Trans. N.\r\nZ. Inst. xix. 25.)\r\n\r\n(Plate V., fig. 17 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis fine species has occurred at Wellington in the North Island, and in\r\nthe South Island at Christchurch, and West Plains, near Invercargill.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1¾ inches. The fore-wings are brown; there\r\n  is a shaded, pale yellowish-brown, longitudinal line on the costa, _and\r\n  an extensive irregular patch of the same colour from about two-thirds to\r\n  within a short distance of the termen; the orbicular is large, oval,\r\n  oblique, pale yellowish-brown; the claviform is semicircular, broadly\r\n  margined with black_; the reniform is dull grey, with one large and one\r\n  small white mark towards the termen; the termen is broadly shaded with\r\n  dark blackish-brown, except near the apex of the wing and a little below\r\n  the middle. The hind-wings are dark brownish-grey, with the cilia\r\n  reddish-brown. The female is rather paler with a slightly olive tinge.\r\n  Both sexes vary a little in the depth of their colouring.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from October till May. It is common at\r\nChristchurch, but rather scarce in Wellington.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA OCTANS, n. sp.\r\n\r\n(Plate V., fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nThis distinctly marked little species was discovered by Mr. Philpott, at\r\nMount Linton, near Invercargill.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1¾ inches. The fore-wings are pale\r\n  ochreous-brown; there are several wavy brown transverse lines near the\r\n  base, two lines at about one-third, _then a large_ V-_shaped white mark\r\n  extending almost from the costa and touching the dorsum_; the orbicular\r\n  and reniform spots are situated in the middle of this mark, the orbicular\r\n  is very finely outlined in brown, and contains a black dot towards the\r\n  base of the wing; the reniform is large, dark brown, _surrounded by a\r\n  large triangular dark brown shading_; there is an obscure subterminal\r\n  line; the termen is slightly indented. The hind-wings are dark brown,\r\n  paler towards the termen.\r\n\r\nThis species may be immediately recognised by the large, white, V-shaped\r\nmarkings on the fore-wings.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in March.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA RUBESCENS, Butl.\r\n\r\n(_Xylophasia rubescens_, Butl., Cist. Ent. ii. 489. _Mamestra rubescens_,\r\nMeyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xix. 25.)\r\n\r\n(Plate V., fig. 18 [M].)\r\n\r\nThis insect is apparently a mountain species. It has been taken at Mount\r\nArthur, Castle Hill, and Lake Wakatipu.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1-5/8 inches. The fore-wings are pale\r\n  orange-brown, the orbicular and claviform spots are faintly margined with\r\n  reddish-brown; the reniform is dark brown and very conspicuous; there are\r\n  two large reddish-brown markings on the termen. The hind-wings are dark\r\n  grey tinged with red. The cilia of all the wings are reddish-brown.\r\n\r\nThis species varies slightly in the shape and extent of the markings on the\r\ntermen {26}of the fore-wings, which occasionally cause the pale ground\r\ncolour to form tooth-like projections. It also varies a little in the\r\nintensity of the other markings, and in the depth of the ground colour.\r\n\r\nThe moth appears in January and February, and is attracted by light. I have\r\ntaken it in some abundance on the Tableland of Mount Arthur, at an altitude\r\nof 3,500 feet above the sea-level.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA LIGNANA, Walk.\r\n\r\n(_Hadena lignana_, Walk., Noct. 758. ? _Xylophasia morosa_, Butl., Cist.\r\nEnt. ii. 543. _Mamestra lignana_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xix. 26.)\r\n\r\n(Plate V., fig. 19 [M].)\r\n\r\nThis pretty species is very common at Wellington in the North Island. In\r\nthe South Island it has occurred at Mount Hutt.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1½ inches. _The fore-wings are\r\n  greyish-cream-colour_, slightly paler on the costa. There are two very\r\n  distinct blackish transverse marks on the costa near the base, and two\r\n  others at about one-third; _the stigmata are all sharply and finely\r\n  outlined in black; the orbicular is oval, the claviform triangular, the\r\n  reniform large and oblong, containing a smaller black-edged mark in its\r\n  centre, and a blackish blotch towards its lower margin_; beyond the\r\n  reniform there is a faint jagged transverse line; there are two dark\r\n  patches on the termen, _the pale ground colour forming two sharp\r\n  tooth-like markings slightly below the middle_; the termen itself is\r\n  slightly indented, and the cilia are dark brown. The hind-wings are dark\r\n  grey with the cilia white.\r\n\r\nSome specimens of this insect are slightly darker than others, but in other\r\nrespects there are no important variations.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from October till April. It comes freely to\r\nsugar and to light, and is often taken at rest on trees and fences in the\r\ndaytime.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA COELENO, n. sp.\r\n\r\n(Plate IV., fig. 39.)\r\n\r\nThis interesting species has been taken at Wellington by Messrs. Hawthorne\r\nand Norris.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1-3/8 inches. The fore-wings are very pale\r\n  brownish-cream-colour; _there is a large irregular dark brown patch on\r\n  the dorsum from about one-eighth to about two-thirds, another smaller\r\n  patch at the tornus, and another still smaller on the termen a little\r\n  above the middle_; there are two very obscure transverse lines; the\r\n  orbicular is finely outlined in brown; the reniform contains two very\r\n  dark brown dots, and is rather strongly outlined in brown towards the\r\n  base. The hind-wings are dark grey. The cilia of all the wings are grey\r\n  with a paler line.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in November.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA USTISTRIGA, Walk.\r\n\r\n(_Xylina ustistriga_, Walk., Noct. 630. _X. lignisecta_, ib., 631.\r\n_Mamestra ustistriga_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xix. 26.)\r\n\r\n(Plate V., fig. 20 [M], 20A [F].)\r\n\r\nThis beautiful insect has occurred commonly at Wellington in the North\r\nIsland, and in the South Island, at Blenheim, Christchurch, and Lake\r\nColeridge.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1¾ inches. _The fore-wings, head, and\r\n  thorax are pinkish-grey in the male, pale grey in female; the orbicular\r\n  spot is rather large, nearly round, finely outlined in black; the\r\n  reniform is very large, margined with black towards the base of the wing,\r\n  and usually touching the orbicular spot or connected with it by a short\r\n  black line_; the claviform is triangular, also black margined; there is a\r\n  cloudy oblique line below the reniform, and an irregular line between the\r\n  reniform and the termen. The hind-wings and abdomen are pale pinkish-grey\r\n  in male, dull grey in female; the cilia are white with a cloudy line.\r\n\r\n{27}This insect varies slightly in size, especially in the female. The\r\nlarva is dull greyish-brown, with the subdorsal and lateral lines darker.\r\nIt feeds on honeysuckle during the summer months.\r\n\r\nThe pupa state is spent in the earth.\r\n\r\nThe moth is very irregular in its appearance. I have captured specimens in\r\nJanuary, February, March, April, July and September. It appears to pass the\r\nwinter in both the pupa and imago states. It is very partial to light, and\r\nin consequence often enters houses.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA PRIONISTIS, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Mamestra prionistis_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xix. 27.)\r\n\r\n(Plate V., fig. 21 [M].)\r\n\r\nThis species is common at Wellington in the North Island. In the South\r\nIsland it has been taken at Rakaia.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings of the male is 1-5/8 inches, of the female 1¾\r\n  inches. _The fore-wings are rather pale yellowish-brown, with numerous\r\n  irregular longitudinal grey streaks_; there are several very obscure\r\n  jagged transverse lines, and the stigmata are almost invisible; _a very\r\n  broad blackish longitudinal band is situated on the dorsum_. The\r\n  hind-wings are brownish-grey; the cilia are grey tipped with white. The\r\n  head and thorax are grey tinged with yellowish-brown; there is a\r\n  conspicuous blackish streak on each side of the thorax.\r\n\r\nIn this species the dorsal band is often considerably paler, but otherwise\r\nthere is no variation.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from November till April. It comes freely to\r\nsugar, and occasionally to light. It is also sometimes met with at rest on\r\ntrees in the daytime, where its colouring is protective. I have noticed\r\nthat this moth is much commoner in some years than in others.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA PHRICIAS, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Mamestra temperata_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xix. 27 (nee Walk.).\r\n_Mamestra phricias_, Meyr., ib., xx. 46.)\r\n\r\n(Plate V., fig. 22.)\r\n\r\nThis species has occurred in the Manawatu district in the North Island. In\r\nthe South Island it has been found at Christchurch and Lake Coleridge.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1½ inches. _The fore-wings are pale\r\n  silvery-grey_; there are several obscure blackish marks near the base,\r\n  _two dark, shaded, transverse bands, one just before the orbicular, and\r\n  one between the orbicular and the reniform_; the orbicular is round,\r\n  nearly white, with a faint greyish ring in the middle; the reniform is\r\n  large, oblong, margined first with white and then with black; there is a\r\n  series of black crescentic marks near the termen, and another smaller\r\n  series on the termen; the cilia are dark grey. The hind-wings are dull\r\n  brownish-grey, the cilia are grey tipped with white. The terminal joint\r\n  of the palpi is elongated.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect has been taken in December, February, March and June,\r\nand is attracted by light. It is rather a rare species.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANCHRA CUCULLINA, Gn.\r\n\r\n  (_Xylocampa cucullina_, Gn., Ent. Mo. Mag. v. 40. Agrotis mitis, Butl.,\r\n  Proc. Zool. Soc.

Inst. xix. 28.)\r\n\r\n(Plate V., fig. 23 [M].)\r\n\r\nThis species has occurred at Mount Arthur, and at Rakaia.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1-3/8 inches. _The fore-wings are\r\n  bluish-grey, speckled and dappled with blackish-brown_; there is a pale\r\n  transverse line near the base, partially edged with black; the orbicular\r\n  is round, containing a blackish dot in the middle; the reniform is\r\n  elongate-oval, including a {28}dark spot in its lower portion; the space\r\n  surrounding the stigmata is clouded with dark blackish-brown; there is a\r\n  terminal series of small blackish crescentic marks, and the cilia are\r\n  dark grey. The hind-wings are brownish-grey; the cilia are also grey\r\n  tipped with white.\r\n\r\nThis species is evidently closely allied to _M. phricias, but may at\r\npresent be distinguished by its darker and more bluish colouring_.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in January and March. I have taken it at light\r\non the Tableland of Mount Arthur, at 3,600 feet above the sea-level.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 8.--ERANA, Walk.\r\n\r\n  \"Eyes hairy. Antennæ in male filiform, simple, with scattered single\r\n  cilia. Thorax with anterior and posterior crests. Abdomen with strong\r\n  dorsal crests towards base. Fore-wings in male beneath with a very long\r\n  dense tuft of scent-giving hairs from base; transverse vein absent, 7 and\r\n  8 out of 9, 10 free. Hind-wings with transverse vein absent, costa in\r\n  male broadly dilated.\"--(Meyrick.) (Plate II., fig. 9 fore-wing, 10\r\n  hind-wing.)[16]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have one species representing this interesting genus.\r\n\r\n\r\nERANA GRAMINOSA, Walk.\r\n\r\n(_Erana graminosa_, Walk., Noct. 605. _E. vigens_, ib., Suppl. 743. _Erana\r\ngraminosa_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xix. 28.)\r\n\r\n(Plate V., fig. 24 [M], 25 [F]; Plate III., fig. 8, larva.)\r\n\r\nThis beautiful species appears to be fairly common in many forests in the\r\nNorth Island. It has occurred at Wanganui, Masterton, Palmerston, and\r\nWellington. In the South Island it has been taken by Mr. Philpott, at West\r\nPlains, near Invercargill.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1½ inches. The fore-wings are bright\r\n  green; there are three paler green transverse lines, edged with black;\r\n  one near the base of the wing, one just beyond the reniform spot, and one\r\n  close to the termen; this last is inwardly much clouded with dark\r\n  olive-green; the reniform spot is pale green edged with black. The\r\n  hind-wings are very broad, pinkish-brown, tinged with green on the\r\n  termen. In the female the hind-wings are considerably narrower, and are\r\n  not so strongly tinged with green as in the male.\r\n\r\nSome specimens appear to be rather darker than others, but beyond this I\r\nhave not detected any variation.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are rather large, globular, flattened above and beneath, and pale\r\ngreen in colour.\r\n\r\nThe larva feeds on the mahoe (_Melicytus ramiflorus_).\r\n\r\n  When first excluded from the egg it is about 1/8 inch long, and of a very\r\n  pale green colour. After the first moult the caterpillar is bright green,\r\n  darker towards the head, with white dorsal, subdorsal, and lateral lines;\r\n  there are eight rows of shining black spots, each spot emitting a number\r\n  of stout black bristles; the head is yellowish-brown with a few black\r\n  dots. After the last moult the larva has a totally different appearance.\r\n  It is pale green marbled with darker green; there is often a whitish\r\n  lateral line, and an obscure series of diagonal green stripes on the\r\n  sides of each segment. Sometimes the whole larva has a pinkish-brown\r\n  tinge, and there are often two or three rows of pale spots. In fact the\r\n  full-grown caterpillar is very variable in its colouring.\r\n\r\nThese larvæ hibernate during the winter months, often secreting themselves\r\nin the burrows which have been made in the stems of the mahoe by various\r\nspecies of wood-boring insects. They come abroad about the end of August,\r\nand are full grown early in October. The pupa state is spent in the earth.\r\n\r\nThe moth appears in December, January, February, March and April. It is\r\noften {29}found at rest on tree-trunks in the daytime, where its beautiful\r\ngreen colouring causes it to resemble, in the closest possible manner, a\r\npatch of moss. Mr. Hawthorne tells me that he has frequently found dead\r\nspecimens in this situation.\r\n\r\nThis insect is, I think, commoner at slight elevations above the sea-level,\r\nforest ranges of from 500 to 1,000 feet in height being apparently the most\r\nfavourable localities for the species. The appearance of the moth over so\r\nlong a period would seem to indicate that there are two generations in a\r\nyear, but I have never found full-grown larvæ in the middle of summer.\r\nThere is, however, no doubt that the insect passes the winter in the larval\r\ncondition. This species is often met with very late in the season,\r\nfrequenting the few remaining blossoms of the white rata until the first or\r\nsecond week in April. Mr. Meyrick thus alludes to the scented tuft of hairs\r\nin the male insect: \"The large tuft of the fore-wings is the source of a\r\nvery strong vanilla-like perfume, which scents the box in which the\r\nspecimens are contained for more than a week after their death; the scent\r\nis excited more strongly, even in the dead specimen, by stirring the tuft\r\nwith a pin.\"[17]\r\n\r\nI can fully testify to the accuracy of this interesting observation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSub-family 3.--_CARADRINIDES_.\r\n\r\n  \"Eyes naked, not ciliated.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 9.--BITYLA, Walk.\r\n\r\n  \"Antennæ in male filiform, shortly ciliated.

The hind-wings are dark grey, also glossy.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in January, February, and March, and is\r\nattracted by light. The single specimen I possess in my collection was\r\ntaken in July, evidently hibernating. It is a rare species.\r\n\r\n\r\nBITYLA SERICEA, Butl.\r\n\r\n(_Bityla sericea_, Butl., Proc. Zool. Soc.

The hind-wings are dark grey and glossy;\r\n  _the cilia are pale grey, very broadly tipped with cream colour_.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in February and March, and is attracted by\r\nlight. It is a rather scarce species.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 10.--AGROTIS, Ochs.\r\n\r\n  Head rough-scaled; eyes naked. Antennæ in [M] ciliated, often acutely\r\n  bidentate or bipectinated, with apex simple.

Agrotis suffusa, Hb. _Agrotis ypsilon_, Meyr.,\r\nTrans. N. Z. Inst. xix. 32.)\r\n\r\n(Plate V., fig. 35 [M], 36 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis handsome insect is probably very common throughout the country. It has\r\noccurred abundantly at Napier, Wellington, Nelson, Christchurch, Ashburton\r\nand Invercargill.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 2 inches. The fore-wings are pale brown,\r\n  shaded with rich brown on the costa and termen; the reniform is large and\r\n  black, with a conspicuous longitudinal streak pointing towards the\r\n  termen; the orbicular is round, centred with black; the claviform is\r\n  elongate; there is a dark shaded line below the reniform, followed by a\r\n  double wavy transverse black line. The hind-wings are grey with pinkish\r\n  reflections; they are shaded with darker grey towards the termen; the\r\n  cilia are white, the head and thorax are dark brown, the abdomen grey. In\r\n  the female the brown costal shading extends across the central portions\r\n  of the fore-wings to the dorsum, and the general colouring is also\r\n  darker.\r\n\r\nThere are no noteworthy variations in either sex. The larva feeds on the\r\nroots of grasses. Its head is pale brown mottled with darker brown, and its\r\nbody is lead-colour with darker dorsal and lateral lines. It remains\r\nunderground during the daytime, coming abroad at night to feed.\r\n\r\nThe pupa is red-brown with a very sharp, spine-like extremity. It is\r\nconcealed in the earth.[18]\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in January, February and March. It is often very\r\nabundant at various blossoms in the evening, and comes readily to sugar. It\r\nis an insect of almost universal distribution, occurring in Australia,\r\nChina, India, Africa, Europe, and North and South America.[19]\r\n\r\n\r\n{31}AGROTIS ADMIRATIONIS, Gn.\r\n\r\n(_Agrotis admirationis_, Gn. (nec Meyrick), Ent. Mo. Mag. v. 38.)\r\n\r\n(Plate V., fig. 37.)\r\n\r\nThis species has been taken at Christchurch.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1-3/8 inches. The fore-wings are dull grey;\r\n  there are two minute black marks on the costa near the base, a slender\r\n  interrupted transverse line at about one-third, _the orbicular, reniform,\r\n  and claviform spots are very large and conspicuous, surrounded by a dark\r\n  grey shading_; there is a series of black dots on the termen. The\r\n  hind-wings are pale grey. The cilia of all the wings are also pale grey.\r\n\r\nDescribed and figured from a specimen in Mr. Fereday's collection. I am\r\nassured by Mr. Fereday that the above-described insect is the true _Agrotis\r\nadmirationis_ of Guenée, described from an identical specimen which he\r\nforwarded to Guenée. The following species, which is regarded by Mr.\r\nMeyrick as _Agrotis admirationis_, Gn. (see Trans. N. Z. Inst. xix. 33), is\r\ntherefore renamed as below.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGROTIS INNOMINATA, n. sp.\r\n\r\n(_Agrotis admirationis_, Meyr. (nec Guenée), Trans. N. Z.

The fore-wings are pale\r\n  pinkish-yellow; there is a slender black longitudinal streak on the costa\r\n  at the base, _a broad black longitudinal streak at the base near the\r\n  middle, and another a little beyond the base above the middle, containing\r\n  the orbicular and reniform stigmata, these are sharply outlined in\r\n  pinkish-yellow_; there are several rather indistinct black streaks\r\n  between the veins, and a series of terminal black dots; the cilia are\r\n  dull pinkish-yellow. The hind-wings are dull white; there is a series of\r\n  brownish terminal dots, and the veins are marked in brown; _the cilia are\r\n  shining white_. The head and thorax are pinkish-brown; the latter has two\r\n  transverse black lines near the head, and two longitudinal black streaks\r\n  on each side. The abdomen is dull white tipped with pale brown.\r\n\r\nOne specimen of this insect is considerably tinged with very pale\r\nolive-green instead of pink, but it is otherwise identical. As the\r\navailable material is so extremely limited, I am unable to say which is the\r\ntypical form.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in December. I am indebted to Messrs. J. H.\r\nLewis and W. R. Morris for my specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGROTIS SERICEA, Butl.\r\n\r\n  (_Chersotis sericea_, Butl., Cist. Ent. ii. 490. _C. inconspicua_, ib.\r\n  545. _Agrotis sericea_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z.

The fore-wings vary from\r\n  very pale grey to dark blackish-grey; there is an obscure transverse line\r\n  near the base, and another at about one-fourth; _the orbicular is oval\r\n  and dark centred, the claviform is elongate, often very obscure, the\r\n  reniform is broad dark centred, usually joined to the orbicular by a dark\r\n  patch_; all the stigmata are outlined in black; beyond the reniform there\r\n  is a rather jagged transverse line, and _several faint wedge-shaped\r\n  markings_; there is a series of minute elongate black marks on the\r\n  termen; the cilia are grey with three dark lines. The hind-wings are grey\r\n  with several fine black marks on the termen; the cilia are white.\r\n\r\nThis species seems to be rather variable both in ground colour and in\r\nmarkings.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in October, November, December and January. It\r\nis not a common species.\r\n\r\n\r\n{32}AGROTIS CEROPACHOIDES, Gn.\r\n\r\n(_Agrotis ceropachoides_, Gn., Ent. Mo. Mag. v. 39; Meyr., Trans. N.

N. Z. Inst. xix. 34.)\r\n\r\n(Plate V., fig. 40 [M], 41 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis species has occurred plentifully at Waimarama (Hawkes Bay) and\r\nWellington, in the North Island; and at Nelson, Blenheim, Christchurch,\r\nRakaia, and Ashburton in the South Island. In Wellington it is certainly\r\nnot so common as formerly, and Mr. Meyrick observes that its abundance is\r\ndeclining in some other localities also.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is from 1½ to 1¾ inches. The fore-wings are\r\n  pale yellowish-brown, sometimes tinged with red. There is an irregular\r\n  band of dull grey or brown near the termen; _the reniform is small and\r\n  black; the orbicular minute, also black; the claviform is obsolete_;\r\n  there are several very indistinct traces of transverse lines towards the\r\n  base of the wing. The hind-wings are dull yellow, _with a very broad,\r\n  blackish, terminal band_. The head and thorax are yellowish-brown, and\r\n  the abdomen is dull yellow.\r\n\r\nThis insect varies a good deal in the ground colouring of the fore-wings,\r\nwhich ranges from dull yellow to brick-red, or even to dark\r\nyellowish-brown. The hind-wings are also much darker in some specimens than\r\nin others.\r\n\r\nThe larva feeds on the seeds and flowers of various plants. It is extremely\r\nvariable in its colouring.\r\n\r\n  Some specimens are dull green, with a few obscure red spots on the sides\r\n  of the anterior segments. Others are brownish-black, with many fine\r\n  yellow stripes and dots, and the red spots confined to the three anterior\r\n  segments. Others, again, have numerous olive-green, white, and pale green\r\n  lines, with a reddish blotch on the side of nearly every segment.\r\n\r\nThis caterpillar is often rather destructive in gardens. Amongst other\r\nthings, it devours tomatoes and peas, the flowers and young fruit of\r\npumpkins and vegetable marrows, the flowers and leaves of geraniums,\r\nveronicas, &c. It is full grown in the autumn.\r\n\r\nThe pupa is concealed in the earth, the insect remaining in this condition\r\nuntil the following summer.\r\n\r\n{33}The moth appears in January and February. It often flies by day, and\r\nmay then be seen disporting itself amongst the flowers of the Scotch\r\nthistle. Its larva may also be found feeding on these flowers.\r\n\r\nThis insect is practically cosmopolitan; it has occurred in the following\r\ncountries: Australia, Samoa, India, Ceylon, Madagascar, Africa, Europe,\r\nNorth and South America.[20]\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 12.--COSMODES, Gn.\r\n\r\n  \"Eyes naked.

The fore-wings are rich\r\n  orange-brown, with _four large green spots margined with silver_; there\r\n  is a curved silvery mark near the apex. The hind-wings are pale yellow,\r\n  shaded with orange-brown towards the termen; the cilia are pale\r\n  orange-brown mixed with white.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in March and April.\r\n\r\nMr. Meyrick states that it occurs commonly in Eastern Australia.[21]\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily 3.--PLUSIADÆ.\r\n\r\nThe _Plusiadæ_ are characterized as follows:--\r\n\r\n  \"Ocelli usually distinct. Tongue well developed. Posterior tibiæ with all\r\n  spurs present. Fore-wings with veins 7 and 8 usually out of 9, 10 usually\r\n  connected with 9.

Inst. xix. 36.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VI., fig. 3 [M].)\r\n\r\nThis insect is probably generally distributed in the North Island, and in\r\nthe northern portions of the South Island. It has occurred very commonly at\r\nTaranaki, Napier, and Nelson, but in Wellington it is rather a scarce\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1½ inches. The fore-wings are dark\r\n  grey with bronzy reflections; there is a pale band on the termen, and\r\n  several of the transverse lines are indicated by paler colouring, the two\r\n  basal ones being often silvery; _the orbicular is partly outlined with\r\n  golden-white, and the claviform is wholly filled in with the same\r\n  colour_. The hind-wings are yellowish-grey, darker towards the termen.\r\n\r\nMr. Meyrick mentions a variety in which the characteristic golden-white\r\ndiscal spots on the fore-wings are absent. I have not yet had the good\r\nfortune to see this form, and think it must be a rare one.\r\n\r\nThe larva has twelve legs; it is much attenuated towards the head; its\r\ncolour is pale green, darker on the back; there is a number of wavy white\r\nlines and dots on the larva, as well as a few isolated black dots and\r\nhairs. It feeds on geraniums, mint, bean, Scotch thistle, and many other\r\ngarden plants and weeds. Its original food appears to have been the \"potato\r\nplant\" (_Solarium aviculare_); but now it only occurs on this shrub in\r\nuncultivated localities, where there is no European vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe pupa is enclosed in a cocoon of white silk, generally situated between\r\ntwo dead leaves on or near the ground.\r\n\r\nThe moth first appears about September, and continues abundant until the\r\nend of summer. In Nelson I have seen it in great profusion, hovering over\r\nvarious flowers in the evening, at which time it also occasionally\r\nendeavours to gain access to beehives. In the same locality I have met with\r\nthe young larvæ in the middle of winter, so that there is probably a\r\ncontinuous succession of broods all the year through in favourable\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\nThis insect is found in Australia, Pacific Islands, Africa, South Asia,\r\nSouth Europe, and occasionally in the South of England.[22]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 3.--DASYPODIA, Gn.\r\n\r\n  \"Eyes naked.

The hind-wings\r\n  are rich brown, slightly paler than the fore-wings; there are three\r\n  shaded, wavy, transverse lines. The termen of both wings is slightly\r\n  scalloped with a minute bluish-white dot at each indentation; the cilia\r\n  are dark brown.\r\n\r\nThe life-history is thus described by Mr. Colenso:--\r\n\r\n  The larva when full grown is about 3¾ inches in length, elongate,\r\n  slightly thicker in the middle, and with the skin smooth. It is\r\n  ash-colour, speckled with minute points of black and red; two minute\r\n  carmine spots are situated close together on its back; and, when in\r\n  motion, two large triangular black splashes are also visible. The under\r\n  side of the larva is dull white, with several dull olive spots\r\n  corresponding to its ventral prolegs. Its head is small, and pale Indian\r\n  yellow in colour; its anal and ventral prolegs are large; on being\r\n  touched the caterpillar coils itself up very rapidly and closely.\r\n\r\nThe specimen from which Mr. Colenso's description was taken, was found at\r\nrest on the trunk of a large acacia-tree, which is probably the food-plant\r\nof the larva.\r\n\r\nThe pupa is enclosed in a cocoon formed of leaves fastened together with\r\nsilk. The insect appears to remain in this condition for about two months.\r\n\r\nThe pupa-case (after emergence) is nearly cylindrical, very obtuse at the\r\nhead, and tapering regularly downwards from the end of the wing-cases, with\r\nthe tail conical; the abdominal segments are very strongly marked. Its\r\ncolour is dark red, with a bluish or violet bloom, but smooth and shining\r\non its prominent parts.[23]\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in January, February, and March, but it is\r\nrather a scarce species. It is attracted by light, and thus occasionally\r\nenters houses, where specimens are generally captured.

The hind-wings are greyish-ochreous; there is a rather\r\n  faint line across the middle, followed by a broad shade; a series of\r\n  {37}small crescentic marks is situated on the termen; the cilia are dark\r\n  greyish-ochreous. _The antennæ of the male are strongly bipectinated. The\r\n  female is considerably darker, the markings are less distinct and\r\n  numerous, and there is no black blotch between the orbicular and the\r\n  reniform._\r\n\r\n  Some male specimens are much paler in colour than others, but with this\r\n  exception there does not appear to be any important variation.\r\n\r\n  The eggs are round, flattened above, bright green, becoming dull purplish\r\n  about two days after being laid.\r\n\r\n  The young larva when first emerged is about 1/8 inch in length; the head\r\n  is brown; the body dull white, with a series of black tubercles round\r\n  each segment, each tubercle emitting a tuft of bristles. The larva has\r\n  sixteen legs, but the two anterior pairs of ventral claspers are not\r\n  employed in walking, the caterpillar's mode of progression, consequently,\r\n  resembling that of a larva with twelve legs only. The food-plant is\r\n  _Piper excelsum_.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from September till April, and is very common\r\namongst undergrowth in the forest. It is seldom found in the daytime, but\r\nat night it is extremely abundant in densely wooded situations. It flies in\r\na very stealthy manner, and may soon be recognised on the wing by this\r\nfeature alone. When disturbed it always secretes itself amongst dead fern\r\nfronds or other vegetable refuse, where its sombre colour effectually\r\nconceals it.\r\n\r\nThe costal fold on the under side of the fore-wing of the male contains a\r\nvery large tuft of extremely long hairs. It probably emits a scent\r\nagreeable to the female.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHAPSA OCTIAS. Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Hyperaucha octias_, Meyr., Trans. Ent. Soc. Lond., 1897, 383.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VI., fig. 7.)\r\n\r\nThis interesting little species has recently occurred in some numbers in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Wellington. I have no record at present of its capture\r\nin any other New Zealand locality.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1 inch. The fore-wings have the costa\r\n  straight, and the termen with a large projection slightly above the\r\n  middle; the colour is pale brown; _there is a broad dark brown patch on\r\n  the costa at the base_, a jagged transverse line at about one-fourth, _a\r\n  very broad, oblique, blackish-brown, oblong patch on the costa at about\r\n  one-third; beyond this patch is situated the reniform which is very\r\n  large, indented towards the termen where it is outlined in dark brown_;\r\n  there is a very fine jagged transverse line from beneath the reniform to\r\n  the dorsum; _a large irregular patch of dark brownish-black just before\r\n  the apex_, and an obscure transverse line; there is a series of minute,\r\n  dark brown, crescentic marks on the termen. The hind-wings are dull\r\n  whitish-grey; there is a faint blackish dot in the middle, a wavy line a\r\n  little below the middle, and a terminal series of small dark marks. The\r\n  antennæ are filiform in both sexes.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in October, November and December. It frequents\r\ndense forest ravines, and is generally disturbed from amongst dead leaves\r\nor old fern fronds. It is usually a very scarce species, but appears to be\r\nmuch commoner in some years than in others. According to Mr. Meyrick, it is\r\nalso found in Australia.\r\n\r\nThis species is placed by Mr. Meyrick in the genus _Rhapsa_. The simple\r\nantennæ and absence of the broad costal fold in the males would appear,\r\nhowever, to remove it from that genus, as restricted by him in the\r\n'Transactions' of the New Zealand Institute, xix. 38. In all other respects\r\nit appears to conform to the genus.[25]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{38}II.--THE NOTODONTINA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Notodontina_ are characterized as follows:--\r\n\r\n  \"The maxillary palpi are obsolete. Fore-wings with vein 1b usually\r\n  furcate, but with lower fork often weak or tending to be obsolete, 5\r\n  rising not nearer to 4 than to 6, parallel, 7 and 8 out of 9. Hind-wings\r\n  almost always with frenulum, 1c absent. (Plate II., figs. 19 to 64, and\r\n  Plate I., figs. 12 and 13.)\r\n\r\n  \"Imago with fore-wings more or less broad-triangular; hind-wings\r\n  broad-ovate.\"--(Meyrick.)\r\n\r\n  Larva (in New Zealand) generally with 10 or 12 legs only (Plate III.,\r\n  figs. 12, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 24), rarely with 16 (_Sphinx_, Pl.\r\n  III., figs. 13 and 14).\r\n\r\n  \"Pupa with segments 9 to 11 free; not protruded from cocoon in\r\n  emergence.\"--(Meyrick.)\r\n\r\nThis is a very extensive group of the Lepidoptera, and so far as it is\r\nrepresented in New Zealand is equivalent to that group formerly known as\r\nthe _Geometrina_, with the addition of the family _Sphingidæ_. The insects\r\nhere included comprise many of our most interesting, abundant, and\r\nbeautiful species. Some of them are so extremely variable that it is often\r\na matter of considerable difficulty to determine the most convenient points\r\non which to base the specific distinctions; although fortunately great\r\nadvances have been made in this direction of late years owing to the\r\nincrease in the number of workers, and the consequent accumulation of\r\navailable material. In connection with this portion of the subject, special\r\nmention should be made of Mr. Meyrick's paper on the group, which appeared\r\nin the 'Transactions' of the New Zealand Institute for 1883. This essay has\r\nbeen of the greatest value in dispelling the doubts which formerly existed\r\nrespecting the limits of many of the most variable species.\r\n\r\nThe _Notodontina_ are represented in New Zealand by the six following\r\nfamilies:--\r\n\r\n  1. HYDRIOMENIDÆ.     4. ORTHOSTIXIDÆ.\r\n  2. STERRHIDÆ.        5. SELIDOSEMIDÆ.\r\n  3. MONOCTENIADÆ.     6. SPHINGIDÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily 1.--HYDRIOMENIDÆ.\r\n\r\nThe _Hydriomenidae_  are thus characterized:--\r\n\r\n  \"Tongue well developed. Fore-wings with vein 10 rising separate;\r\n  anastomosing with 11 and 9 (forming double areole), or rising out of 11\r\n  and anastomosing with 9 (forming simple areole). Hind-wings with vein 5\r\n  fully developed, parallel to 4, 6, and 7 almost always stalked or\r\n  connate, 8 anastomosing with upper margin of cell from near base to\r\n  beyond middle, or sometimes approximated only and connected by a bar or\r\n  shortly anastomosing beyond middle.\" (Plate II., figs. 19 to 43.)\r\n\r\n\"A very large family distributed in equal plenty throughout all temperate\r\nregions, but becoming scarcer within the tropics. The structure is very\r\nuniform throughout, and the generic distinctions slight. Imago with body\r\nslender, fore-wings usually broad.\r\n\r\n\"Ovum broad, oval, rather flattened with usually oval reticulations. Larva\r\nelongate, slender, with few hairs, without prolegs on segments 7 to 9;\r\noften imitating live or dead twigs and shoots. Pupa usually\r\nsubterranean.\"--(Meyrick.)\r\n\r\n{39}This family is very extensively represented in New Zealand by the\r\nfollowing fifteen genera:--\r\n\r\n  1. TATOSOMA.        5. ELVIA.        9. VENUSIA.        13. DASYURIS.\r\n\r\n  2. PARADETIS.       6. HYDRIOMENA.  10. ASAPHODES.      14. NOTOREAS.\r\n\r\n  3. CHLOROCLYSTIS.   7. EUCHOECA.  11. XANTHORHOE.     15. SAMANA.\r\n\r\n  4. PHRIXOGONUS.     8. ASTHENA.     12. LYTHRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 1.--TATOSOMA, Butl.\r\n\r\n  \"Face smooth. Palpi long, straight, porrected, shortly rough-scaled,\r\n  terminal joint short. Antennæ in male simple, stout, gradually dilated\r\n  from base to near apex, apex attenuated. Abdomen in male very excessively\r\n  elongate. Hind-wings in male deeply excised near dorsum, dorsal lobe\r\n  folded into a long pocket, fringed with hairs. Fore-wings with vein 6\r\n  rising out of 9, 7 from or above angle of areole, 10 anastomosing\r\n  moderately with 9, 11 anastomosing moderately with 10, 12 free.\r\n  Hind-wings with veins 6 and 7 separate, 8 free, united with 7 before\r\n  transverse vein by an oblique bar.\r\n\r\n\"This singular genus is a remnant of a widely diffused, but now fragmentary\r\ngroup, to which belong also _Lobophora_ (Europe), _Rhopalodes_ (South\r\nAmerica), _Sauris_ (Ceylon), and _Remodes_ (Borneo.) In all, the hind-wings\r\nof the male are peculiarly modified, usually much diminished in size, and\r\nwith the dorsum formed into a distinct lobe, the object of which is\r\nunknown. A similar structure is found only in one or two genera of\r\n_Tortricina_. _Rhopalodes_ is the nearest genus to this, but vein 5 is said\r\nto be obsolete, and the lobe does not form a pocket; in _Sauris_ the areole\r\nis simple, and the antennæ thickly scaled; in _Remodes_ the areole is also\r\nsimple, the antennæ flattened and scaled, and the dorsum is furnished with\r\nthree superposed lobular folds, so that it represents the extreme of\r\ndevelopment in this direction.\"--(Meyrick.)\r\n\r\nIt will be seen on reference to Plate II., figs. 22 and 23, which represent\r\nthe structure of the hind-wings of the male and female of _Tatosoma\r\nagrionata_ respectively, that in the male veins 1 and 2 are absent, having\r\nno doubt become absorbed during the formation of the characteristic sexual\r\nlobe; vein 8 is connected with the margin of the cell by an oblique bar,\r\nthis being probably due to an extension of the wing in the costal region,\r\ncompensating for the loss in the dorsal region due to the above-mentioned\r\nlobe. In the hind-wings of the female the normal neuration of the family is\r\nalmost preserved, the only peculiar feature consisting in the origin of\r\nveins 6 and 7 from a point on the margin of the cell.\r\n\r\nOf this remarkable genus we have three species, and I think it quite\r\npossible that others may reward the industry of future collectors.\r\n\r\n\r\nTATOSOMA LESTEVATA, Walk.\r\n\r\n(_Cidaria lestevata_, Walk. 1416. _Sauris ranata_, Feld. cxxxi. 11.,\r\n_Tatosoma lestevata_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xvi. 67.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VI., fig. 25 [M].)\r\n\r\nThis beautiful species has occurred at Wainuiomata, near Wellington, in the\r\nNorth Island, and at Nelson and Christchurch, in the South Island.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1-3/8 inches. _The fore-wings are\r\n  bright-green; there are four wavy, black, transverse lines; the first\r\n  near the base, the second a little before the middle, the third\r\n  considerably beyond the middle, and the fourth near the termen_; the\r\n  terminal line is very faint towards the tornus, and it emits three or\r\n  four very sharp, longitudinal, black, tooth-like marks; all the\r\n  transverse lines are much stronger where they cross the principal veins.\r\n  The hind-wings are very pale yellowish-green.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in February. At present I believe the species is\r\nrepresented by four specimens only--two in Mr. Fereday's collection and two\r\nin my own.\r\n\r\n\r\n{40}TATOSOMA AGRIONATA, Walk.\r\n\r\n  (_Cidaria agrionata_, Walk. 1417. _Cidaria tipulata_, ib. 1417. _Cidaria\r\n  inclinataria_, ib. 1418. _Cidaria transitaria_, ib. 1419. _Sauris\r\n  mistata_, Feld. cxxxi. 12. _Tatosoma transitaria_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z.\r\n  Inst. xvi. 68. _Tatosoma agrionata_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xvii. 64.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VI., fig. 26 [M], 27 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis fine species has occurred commonly at Wellington in the North Island.\r\nIt is generally distributed in the South Island, and has also been found at\r\nStewart Island.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1½ inches. _The fore-wings are\r\n  bright-green traversed by numerous black, wavy, transverse lines; these\r\n  black lines are grouped into four more or less distinct bands, the\r\n  outermost of which is interrupted at each of the veins_; there is a\r\n  conspicuous black dot in the middle of the wing, a number of small\r\n  triangular black marks near the termen, and a series of minute black dots\r\n  on the termen. The hind-wings are ochreous, tinged with green towards the\r\n  termen. In the female the abdomen is much shorter, and the hind-wings are\r\n  larger than in the male.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from December till April. It frequents dense\r\nforests, and is generally found at rest on the trunks of trees. In these\r\nsituations the pattern of the fore-wings is extremely protective, the whole\r\ninsect bearing the closest possible resemblance to a patch of moss. This\r\nspecies may also be taken at sugar, and sometimes at light, but I have\r\nfound that it can be obtained most plentifully by a careful scrutiny of the\r\ntree-trunks in a favourable locality. As a rule I think that the males are\r\nconsiderably commoner than the females. I have noticed them in the\r\nproportion of about four to one.\r\n\r\n\r\nTATOSOMA TIMORA, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Tatosoma agrionata_, Meyr. (nec Walker), Trans. N. Z. Inst. xvi. 68.\r\n_Tatosoma timora_, Meyr., ib. xvii. 64.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VI., fig. 28 [M], 29 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis rather sombre, though interesting insect, has occurred at Palmerston\r\nand Wellington in the North Island, and at Christchurch and Akaroa in the\r\nSouth Island.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1-3/8 inches. _All the wings are sparsely\r\n  covered with scales. The fore-wings of the male are dull reddish-brown,\r\n  with numerous obscure transverse dusky stripes; there are two rather\r\n  conspicuous blackish blotches on the costa_, a white dot in the middle of\r\n  the wing, a wavy, pale, transverse line near the termen, and a series of\r\n  black terminal dots; the veins are dotted in black. The hind-wings are\r\n  very small, dull grey, with the lobe large and conspicuous. _The female\r\n  is faintly tinged with green, the markings on the fore-wings are rather\r\n  indistinct_; the hind-wings are small, though much larger than those of\r\n  the male.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from November till May. It frequents densely\r\nwooded districts, but is not a common species.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 2.--PARADETIS, Meyr.\r\n\r\n  \"Palpi short, arched, roughly-scaled beneath. Antennæ bipectinated.\r\n  Fore-wings with vein 6 from below 9, 7 from below angle of areole, 10\r\n  very shortly anastomosing with 9, 11 out of 10 considerably before angle\r\n  of areole, 12 free. Hind-wings with veins 6 and 7 stalked, 8 separate,\r\n  united to 7 before transverse vein by an oblique bar.\r\n\r\n\"This singular genus is of quite uncertain affinity, and stands at present\r\nalone. The simple areole, and connecting bar of 7 and 8, can only have\r\narisen by modification of the normal type of this family, to which it must\r\nbe referred. It is also the only New Zealand genus except _Declana_ in\r\nwhich the female has pectinated antennæ; but this character recurs in a few\r\nexotic genera not otherwise allied.\"--(Meyrick.)\r\n\r\nPlate II., figs. 27 and 28 represent the neuration of the male of\r\n_Paradetis porphyrias_, vein 2 of the hind-wings being absent in that sex.\r\nIn the female, which is the sex from which Mr. Meyrick characterized the\r\ngenus, the vein is present as usual. Only one species is known.\r\n\r\n\r\n{41}PARADETIS PORPHYRIAS, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Parysatis porphyrias_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xvi. 58. _Paradetis\r\nporphyrias_, Meyr., ib. xviii. 184.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VI., fig. 36 [M].)\r\n\r\nThis interesting little insect has occurred in the South Island at Mount\r\nArthur, Castle Hill, the Otira Gorge, and Lake Wakatipu.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about ¾ inch. _The fore-wings of the male\r\n  are deep purplish-brown_; there is a wavy, reddish, transverse line at\r\n  about one-third and another at about two-thirds; between these two lines\r\n  near the dorsum there are often four, more or less distinct, yellow dots;\r\n  there is an obscure orange mark at the origin of the first line and a\r\n  conspicuous mark at the origin of the second. _The hind-wings are deep\r\n  purplish-brown._ The cilia of all the wings are white. _The fore-wing has\r\n  the apex hooked and the termen deeply excavated above and below the\r\n  middle._ The female is very much paler; the lines are more distinct and\r\n  the veins are marked in brown.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in January. It frequents rather open spots in\r\nthe forest, and flies in a very busy manner close to the ground amongst the\r\nnumerous ferns and other plants, which are always abundant in such\r\nsituations. It is consequently very inconspicuous and sometimes difficult\r\nto capture. Thus, no doubt, it is often overlooked, and perhaps is much\r\ncommoner than at present appears probable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 3.--CHLOROCLYSTIS, Hb.\r\n\r\n  \"Face with short cone of scales. Palpi rough-scaled. Antennæ in male\r\n  shortly ciliated. Abdomen crested. Fore-wings with areole simple, vein 11\r\n  running into or anastomosing with 12. Hind-wings with vein 8 anastomosing\r\n  with cell from near base to beyond middle.\" (Plate II., figs. 19 and 20.)\r\n\r\n\"This genus is especially characteristic of New Zealand, and is also found\r\nin South Asia, a few stragglers occurring in Europe and\r\nelsewhere.\"--(Meyrick.)\r\n\r\nWe have twelve species, several of which are very beautiful.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLOROCLYSTIS PLINTHINA, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Pasiphila plinthina_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xx. 49.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VI., fig. 8.)\r\n\r\nThis pretty species has occurred at Wellington.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about ½ inch. All the wings are traversed\r\n  by numerous obscure, wavy, reddish-yellow lines; the fore-wings have a\r\n  dark shading near the base, _a very large white blotch in the middle_,\r\n  and a dark chocolate-brown patch near the apex. _The hind-wings have a\r\n  large shaded white patch in the middle_, a blackish dot near the base,\r\n  and a series of brownish crescentic marks on the termen; the cilia of all\r\n  the wings are pale brown barred with brownish-black. The termen of the\r\n  fore-wings is very oblique, of the hind-wings rather irregular.\r\n\r\nMany specimens of this insect are strongly tinged with green, and the shape\r\nand size of the white patches on the fore- and hind-wings are subject to\r\nslight variations.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in November and December. It frequents\r\nbrushwood, where it may be occasionally taken at rest on tree-trunks but\r\nmore often dislodged from the foliage. It is not a very common species.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLOROCLYSTIS BILINEOLATA, Walk.\r\n\r\n  (_Eupithecia bilineolata_, Walk. 1246. _E. muscosata_, ib. 1246.\r\n  _Scotosia humerata_, ib. 1362. _Eupithecia semialbata_, ib. 1708. _E.\r\n  cidariaria_, Gn., Ent.

Inst. 50. _P.\r\n  bilineolata_, ib.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VI., fig. 9 type, fig. 10 variety.)\r\n\r\nThis beautiful little species is common, and generally distributed\r\nthroughout the country.\r\n\r\n  {42}The expansion of the wings is ¾ inch. _The fore-wings are bright\r\n  green with numerous wavy darker lines._ There is a jagged transverse\r\n  black line near the base, two at about one-fourth, enclosing a rather\r\n  paler space; beyond this there are several rather irregular, fine black\r\n  marks, and an obscure white patch below the apex; the cilia are dull\r\n  green. The hind-wings are grey slightly tinged with reddish; the dorsum\r\n  and termen are shaded with green, and there is a number of curved black\r\n  lines on the dorsum; the cilia are dull greenish-grey. The termen of the\r\n  fore-wings is slightly bowed, and all the wings are finely scalloped and\r\n  sharply outlined in black.\r\n\r\nA very distinct variety frequently occurs in which the entire ground colour\r\nis _orange-yellow_. This variety can be artificially produced by exposing a\r\ntypical specimen to the fumes of bruised laurel leaves. Intermediate forms\r\nmay also be found, but are much scarcer than either the typical form or the\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nThe larva (according to Mr. Purdie[26]) is about ½ inch long; colour\r\nbrownish, surface very rugged; body tapering somewhat towards the head. Two\r\npairs of small dorsal tubercles about the middle, the posterior pair being\r\nlarger; oblique lateral dark markings faintly seen on dark ground colour;\r\nbelow lighter. Food-plants: _Aristotelia_, _Leptospermum ericoides_,\r\n_Rubus_ (?), and _Muhlenbeckia_ (?). Found in December and January.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from September till May, and is often very\r\ncommon. It rests on tree-trunks with outspread wings, in which position it\r\nso closely resembles a patch of moss that it is extremely difficult to\r\ndetect, even when specially searched for.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLOROCLYSTIS ANTARCTICA, n. sp.\r\n\r\n(Plate VI., fig. 20.)\r\n\r\nThis species was discovered by Mr. Philpott at West Plains, near\r\nInvercargill.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 7/8 inch. The fore-wings are rather dull\r\n  green; there is a reddish-brown patch near the base, followed by two,\r\n  slightly oblique, reddish bands; the central band is very broad, green,\r\n  traversed by numerous fine wavy lines; there is a broad reddish band on\r\n  the termen. The hind-wings are slaty-grey, tinged with pink towards the\r\n  termen and dorsum. The cilia of all the wings are pink barred with black.\r\n\r\nTwo other specimens kindly given to me by Mr. Philpott have the bands on\r\nthe fore-wings more or less brown in place of red, but are otherwise\r\nidentical.\r\n\r\nThis insect is evidently very closely allied to _C. bilineolata_, but its\r\nlarger size, longer wings, and barred cilia will, I think, distinguish it\r\nfrom that species.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in November.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLOROCLYSTIS ARISTIAS, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Chloroclystis aristias_, Meyr., Trans. Ent. Soc. Lond. 1897, 385.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VI., fig. 21 [M], 22 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis beautiful insect was discovered on the Mount Arthur Tableland in\r\nJanuary, 1896, at an elevation of about 4,000 feet.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1-1/8 inches. _All the wings are very pale\r\n  greenish-grey._ The male has three distinct dark brownish bands near the\r\n  base, an irregular broad suffused band near the middle, becoming obsolete\r\n  before it reaches the dorsum, a dark patch at the apex, another patch on\r\n  the termen below the apex and another near the tornus. The hind-wings are\r\n  traversed by numerous, very fine, wavy blackish lines, becoming darker\r\n  towards the dorsum. In the female there are three wavy reddish-brown\r\n  bands on the costa of the fore-wings, becoming obsolete towards the\r\n  dorsum, then a wavy yellowish line, followed by two rust-red patches. The\r\n  hind-wings resemble those of the male. Both sexes have the veins dotted\r\n  with black, and the cilia of all the wings are grey barred with black.\r\n\r\n{43}The perfect insect was found in a limestone valley at the foot of Mount\r\nPeel, where it was fairly common.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLOROCLYSTIS NEREIS, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Pasiphila nereis_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xx. 51.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VI., fig. 11 [M].)\r\n\r\nThis insect has occurred at Mount Arthur, Mount Hutt, and the Humboldt\r\nRange, Lake Wakatipu, at elevations from 2,500 to 4,000 feet.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is nearly an inch. _All the wings are dusky\r\n  grey with numerous black and dull white, wavy transverse lines_; there is\r\n  often a somewhat paler area near the apex of the fore-wings, and the\r\n  termen of the hind-wings is slightly scalloped; the cilia are dull white\r\n  barred with dark greyish-black.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in January and February. It generally frequents\r\ncliffs on mountain sides, resting with outspread wings on the dark rocky\r\nsurfaces. In these situations it is extremely difficult to detect, and the\r\nprotective value of its colouring is thus at once demonstrated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLOROCLYSTIS DRYAS, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Pasiphila dryas_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xxiii. 97.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VI., fig. 12 [M].)\r\n\r\nThis species has occurred at Wellington.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1 inch. _The fore-wings are dull\r\n  rosy-brown, traversed by numerous obscure blackish transverse lines,\r\n  somewhat concentrated towards the middle and forming an ill-defined\r\n  central band_; the termen is slightly shaded with blackish, and the veins\r\n  are marked with dotted lines. The hind-wings are grey, tinged with\r\n  rosy-brown; there are numerous very faint blackish transverse lines and\r\n  the veins are marked with blackish dots. The cilia of all the wings are\r\n  dark grey. The termen of the hind-wings is rather irregular.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in December and January, and is attracted by\r\nlight. I once took a specimen in July, but this may have been due to an\r\nexceptionally mild winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLOROCLYSTIS SPHRAGITIS, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Pasiphila sphragitis_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xx. 51.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VI., fig. 13 [M], 14 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis extremely variable insect has occurred at Wellington in the North\r\nIsland, and at Christchurch in the South Island.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings of the male is 5/8 inch, of the female ¾ inch.\r\n  _The fore-wings are pale ochreous; there is a narrow darker area at the\r\n  base followed by a narrow oblique pale band_; then a broad central band,\r\n  formed of numerous oblique, wavy, brown, transverse lines, next, a rather\r\n  narrow curved pale band, followed by several small irregular patches on\r\n  the termen, sometimes forming a dark brown terminal band; all the\r\n  markings are much darker on the costa, and portions of the costa, termen,\r\n  and dorsum are frequently tinged with green. The hind-wings are pale\r\n  ochreous; there are numerous wavy, pale brown lines on the dorsum,\r\n  becoming obsolete towards the costa. The termen of all the wings is edged\r\n  with fine black crescents. The cilia are pale ochreous barred with dark\r\n  brown.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect may be met with from September till February, but is\r\nmost abundant in the early spring. It is extremely common in the Wellington\r\nBotanical Gardens, frequenting the forest gullies, where numerous specimens\r\nmay be easily dislodged from amongst the dense undergrowth. This moth rests\r\nwith expanded wings on the leaves and stems of shrubs, but is extremely\r\ndifficult to find in such situations, the colouring of the insect causing\r\nit to closely resemble the droppings of birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n{44}CHLOROCLYSTIS LICHENODES, Purd.\r\n\r\n(_Pasiphila lichenodes_, Purdie, Trans. N. Z. Inst. xix. 70.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VI., figs. 15 and 16, varieties.)\r\n\r\nThis extremely interesting species has occurred at Wellington in the North\r\nIsland, and at Dunedin in the South Island; it has also been found at\r\nStewart Island.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about ¾ inch. The fore-wings are dull\r\n  green; _there is a large pale brown area near the base, divided by fine\r\n  black lines into three distinct patches_; the central portion of the wing\r\n  is mottled with black, pale brown, and dull green; _there is a very\r\n  broad, irregular band of chocolate-brown near the termen, outlined with\r\n  black towards the base and with white towards the termen, the white line\r\n  almost dividing the band into four or five patches_. The hind-wings are\r\n  dull greenish-brown; there are several irregular black and white\r\n  transverse lines and small patches of chocolate-brown, the markings being\r\n  more distinct towards the dorsum. The cilia of all the wings are pale\r\n  brown barred with dark brown.\r\n\r\nI have observed that in many specimens of this species the ground colour is\r\nentirely pale brown instead of green; the markings, however, are not\r\nvariable.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from November till February. It frequents\r\nforests, resting with outspread wings on lichen-covered tree-trunks, where\r\nits wonderfully perfect protective colouring may be seen to great\r\nadvantage. The remarkable brown patches on the wings have undoubtedly been\r\nacquired for this protective purpose, and Mr. Purdie's name is certainly a\r\nmost appropriate one. It is not, I think, a common species.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLOROCLYSTIS INDICATARIA.\r\n\r\n(_Eupithecia indicataria_, Walk. 1708. _Pasiphila indicataria_, Meyr.,\r\nTrans. N. Z.

The cilia are grey barred with brown. The\r\n  hind-wings are dull grey with several faint, jagged, transverse lines;\r\n  the termen is rather irregular. The female is much browner than the male,\r\n  and the lines are more numerous and distinct, especially on the\r\n  hind-wings. _The antennæ are simple in both sexes._\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from October till March, and is fairly common in\r\nwooded localities.

The hind-wings are pale grey with numerous wavy black lines,\r\n  especially near the dorsum. _The antennæ are simple in both sexes._ The\r\n  cilia are dull pink barred with black. The female is slightly tinged with\r\n  reddish-brown. _The male has a peculiar dilation on the costa, beyond the\r\n  middle, beneath which is a naked longitudinal mark occupying the space\r\n  between veins 10 and 12, these veins being slightly distorted in\r\n  consequence._\r\n\r\nThe larva, which feeds on the blossoms of the wharangi (_Brachyglottis\r\nrepanda_), is pale green with a series of elongate triangular brown\r\nmarkings down the back and an obscure series of brown marks on each side.\r\nIt may be found during the latter end of October and beginning of November,\r\nbut is extremely inconspicuous amongst its food-plant. The pupa is\r\nconcealed in a light cocoon constructed of the remains of the blossoms.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from October till February. It frequents dense\r\nundergrowth in the forest, and is generally found resting with extended\r\nwings on the dark-coloured stems of the kawakawa (_Piper excelsum_), where\r\nit is practically invisible.

The hind-wings are cream-coloured, tinged\r\n  with steely blue or green towards the termen; there are a few obscure\r\n  transverse lines and a short series of dots from the dorsum. The apex of\r\n  the fore-wing is very blunt, and the termen is slightly hollowed out\r\n  towards the tornus; _the termen of the hind-wings is deeply scalloped_.\r\n\r\nThis species is extremely variable. In addition to the variations above\r\nindicated, the markings of many specimens differ considerably in intensity,\r\nand there are frequently several large cream-coloured blotches towards the\r\nbase or middle of the forewings.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from September till March, but is not a common\r\nspecies. It frequents forest districts, and may sometimes be found at rest\r\non tree-trunks, where the beautiful colouring of its fore-wings closely\r\nimitates that of certain lichens, and renders its detection in such\r\nsituations extremely difficult. Unlike the insects included in the two\r\npreceding genera, this species closes its wings when at rest, the anterior\r\npair alone being visible. These wings are not held flat, but are curiously\r\nfolded longitudinally, and the end of the abdomen is also curled upwards.\r\nBy slightly raising the insect above the level of the surrounding surface,\r\nthis peculiar attitude considerably increases its resemblance to a lichen\r\ngrowing on the stem or branch of a tree. It will also be observed that in\r\nthis species, which when at rest exposes only its fore-wings, these alone\r\nare protectively coloured; whilst in the genera _Chloroclystis_ and\r\n_Phrissogonus_, where both pairs of wings are displayed, both pairs are\r\nprotectively coloured.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 6.--HYDRIOMENA, Hb.\r\n\r\n  \"Face with somewhat projecting or loose scales, or with conical tuft.\r\n  Palpi rough-scaled.

There is usually a large number of fine,\r\n  slightly waved, oblique lines arranged on both pairs of wings, very like\r\n  the markings in Venusia verriculata_ (see page 53), both insects\r\n  evidently having acquired this style of colouring for similar protective\r\n  purposes. In many specimens the whole of the anterior portion of the\r\n  fore-wings, a small area at the base of the hind-wings, and a band near\r\n  the termen are much paler in colour than the rest. There is usually a\r\n  very oblique elongate pale area near the apex, and an irregular dark spot\r\n  considerably below the apex. The outline of all the wings is more or less\r\n  distinctly scalloped.\r\n\r\nThe larva (according to Mr. Purdie[27]) is about 1 inch in length,\r\ngreyish-brown, with a rough prominent dorsal tubercle about the ninth\r\nsegment. There are sometimes other smaller tubercles.

The\r\n  fore-wings vary from brownish-black to dull orange-brown; there is a\r\n  small darker area near the base, then two pale whitish wavy transverse\r\n  lines, then a broad darker central band, often containing within it a\r\n  still darker central band, bounded by two wavy black transverse lines;\r\n  beyond the central band there are nearly always two or three pale brown\r\n  or whitish, wavy, transverse lines, then an interrupted line just before\r\n  the termen, and a short oblique whitish line below the apex; there is a\r\n  black dot a little above the centre of the wing, and _a white dot on the\r\n  termen near the middle_. The hind-wings are yellowish-brown, with several\r\n  wavy, transverse lines near the dorsum; there is a series of fine\r\n  crescentic black lines on the termen of both fore- and hind-wings.\r\n\r\n{48}This species is extremely variable, but may generally be recognised by\r\na careful scrutiny of the above-named characters. One very striking variety\r\noccasionally met with has the central band of the fore-wing completely\r\ndivided in the middle, which thus forms two dark patches, one on the costa,\r\nand one on the dorsum. (See Plate VII., figs. 7 and 8.) A further\r\ndevelopment of this variety, of which I have only seen one example, taken\r\nby Mr. Hawthorne at Springfield, Canterbury, and now in his collection, has\r\nonly the costal patch present, the whole of the lower portions of the band\r\nbeing completely obliterated.[28]  (See Plate VII., fig. 9.) The minor\r\nvarieties are too numerous to specify.\r\n\r\nThe larva feeds on grasses. When full-grown its length is about 1 inch. The\r\ncolour is dark brown, with the skin very much wrinkled. It is sluggish in\r\nits habits, and lives through the winter, becoming full-grown about the end\r\nof September. During severe weather it generally seeks refuge from the\r\nelements amongst the stalks and roots of the rank herbage often surrounding\r\nstones or fallen logs.\r\n\r\nThe pupa is concealed in the earth.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears early in January, and continues in the utmost\r\nprofusion until the middle or end of March. It may often be seen resting\r\nwith the wings folded backwards and forming together a triangle, whence the\r\nmoth has probably derived its name of _deltoidata_. In the neighbourhood of\r\nWellington I have observed that this insect has very much decreased in\r\nnumbers during the last ten or fifteen years.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDRIOMENA HEMIZONA, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Hydriomena hemizona_, Meyr., Trans.

The fore-wings are\r\n  blackish-brown, darker towards the apex and termen; _there is an obscure\r\n  rust-red wavy band near the base, and another at three-fourths,\r\n  considerably bowed towards the termen at the middle_; there are also\r\n  numerous wavy darker lines. The hind-wings are dull grey, and the termen\r\n  is slightly scalloped.\r\n\r\nThis species may be distinguished from any of the varieties of _H.\r\ndeltoidata_ by its _narrower wings, and the absence of any distinct central\r\nband on the fore-wings_.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in January.

There is a series of black crescentic marks on the\r\n  termen, and the cilia are pale reddish-brown.\r\n\r\n  This species is rather variable. The spaces between the darker bands on\r\n  the fore-wings are usually green, but in some specimens this is partially\r\n  or wholly replaced by pale yellowish-brown. The dark bands also vary\r\n  considerably in width and distinctness, and in many specimens the central\r\n  band is entirely divided by a conspicuous pale brown or green transverse\r\n  space.\r\n\r\n  The larva, according to Mr. Purdie, is about 1 inch long, cylindrical.\r\n  Back a dull deep green; lateral stripe reddish-white, edged below with a\r\n  darker colour; ventral side lighter green, with four parallel white or\r\n  yellow lines close together, extending from the forelegs to the prolegs.\r\n  Outer side of prolegs white. There are traces of a median dorsal stripe\r\n  of brownish-red on the anal segments. Beaten from _Coprosma_. Found in\r\n  January. Mr. Purdie states that he is not quite certain as to the\r\n  identification of the species, as the median belt of the fore-wings is\r\n  much more distinctly defined, and the colour is a duller green than is\r\n  usual in _H. similata_.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from November till March. It is generally found\r\nresting on moss-covered tree-trunks, where its colouring affords it a most\r\nefficient protection from enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDRIOMENA CALLICHLORA, Butl.\r\n\r\n(_Cidaria callichlora_, Butl., Cist.

The hind-wings have three series\r\n  of black dots; the first near the base, the second near the middle, and\r\n  the third on the termen. The termen of both fore- and hind-wings slightly\r\n  projects near the middle.\r\n\r\nThis species varies considerably in the extent of the blackish marking near\r\nthe middle of the fore-wings, as well as in the colour and intensity of the\r\nreddish transverse lines.\r\n\r\n  The larva is thus described by Mr. Fereday:[29] \"The caterpillar has ten\r\n  legs, is cylindrical, rather stout, with the segmental divisions incised;\r\n  its colour is pale dull green, sometimes suffused with pink, brown,\r\n  purple, or dark green; the dorsal line is purplish-brown, suffused, the\r\n  central line whitish; the spiracular line is whitish, broadly margined\r\n  with purplish-brown; the segmental divisions are pale yellowish-brown.\"\r\n\r\nThe food is _Haloragis alata_, a common herbaceous plant growing in swampy\r\nsituations. The pupa is enclosed in a slight earth-covered cocoon.\r\n\r\n{52}The perfect insect appears from September till March, and is sometimes\r\ncommon. It is generally found in wooded districts, but prefers rather open\r\nsituations in the vicinity of streams, where its food-plant may often be\r\nseen. According to Mr. Meyrick,[30] this insect is common in New South\r\nWales, Victoria, and Tasmania, and the Australian and New Zealand specimens\r\nare similar in appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 8.--ASTHENA.\r\n\r\n  \"Face smooth, flat.

N. Z. Inst. xvi. 69.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VI., fig. 37 [M], 38 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis beautiful little insect has occurred at many localities throughout\r\nboth the North and South Islands. It is probably a common species in most\r\nwooded districts.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is almost an inch. _All the wings are very\r\n  pale greenish-white with numerous faint green, wavy, transverse lines._\r\n  The fore-wings have a more or less distinct brown band on the costal\r\n  edge, and a conspicuous greenish central dot. The hind-wings often have a\r\n  slight projection on the termen near the middle.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from October till May, and frequents dense\r\nforest undergrowth. It is chiefly attached to the Kawakawa (_Piper\r\nexcelsum_), and may often be found resting with outspread wings on the\r\nunder-surfaces of the leaves of this plant, where it is very inconspicuous.\r\nThere are probably two or more broods during the summer.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of May, 1892, I observed large numbers of this species flying\r\nover the Manuka bushes in the Wellington Botanical Gardens in brilliant\r\nmoonlight. The night was very cold, but notwithstanding this the moths were\r\nmost numerous and active. The appearance of this insect under such unusual\r\nconditions may have been quite accidental, as I have never seen a\r\nrecurrence; but one is often somewhat unobservant in the winter, hence the\r\nrecord of this observation may be of use in directing the attention of\r\nothers to the subject.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Meyrick this species is also found in Tasmania, and\r\nSouth-east Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\nASTHENA SCHISTARIA, Walk.\r\n\r\n  (_Acidalia schistaria_, Walk. 782. _Asthena subpurpureata_, Walk. 1588.\r\n  _Acidalia tuhuata_, Feld. cxxviii. 5. _Asthena schistaria_, Meyr., Trans.\r\n  N. Z. Inst. xvi. 69.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VI., figs. 39, 40 [M], 41, 42 [F] varieties.)\r\n\r\nThis pretty species is common, and generally distributed throughout the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is nearly an inch. _All the wings vary from\r\n  very pale brown to rather dull purplish-brown; there are numerous jagged,\r\n  darker, transverse lines forming several more or less distinct bands._\r\n  The first of these bands extends from the base to about one-eighth; the\r\n  second, composed of only two or three lines, is situated at about\r\n  one-third; the third extends from {53}three-fourths to about\r\n  five-eighths; there are in addition, numerous very fine, wavy lines near\r\n  the termen. The spaces between these bands are paler, and in some\r\n  specimens the bands are very conspicuous, whilst in others they are\r\n  hardly perceptible. One specimen in my collection (Plate VI., fig. 39)\r\n  has a very broad chocolate-brown band across the middle of both pairs of\r\n  wings, the remaining portions being unusually pale in colour. There is\r\n  always a dark brown dot in the centre of each wing, and a series of very\r\n  fine dots on the termen.\r\n\r\n  The larva, which feeds on Manuka (_Leptospermum_), is very ornamental.\r\n  Its general colour is light green, with black dorsal and lateral stripes,\r\n  and a series of diagonal markings bordered with crimson; the legs and\r\n  prolegs are also crimson, and the segments are divided by brilliant\r\n  yellow rings, a white line extending down each side of the larva.\r\n\r\nThis caterpillar is difficult to find, as it remains closely concealed\r\namongst the dense Manuka foliage, from which it can be dislodged only by\r\nvigorous and continued beating. The larvæ allow themselves to fall a short\r\ndistance, hanging suspended by a silken thread, which they rapidly ascend\r\nwhen the danger is past.\r\n\r\nThe pupa is enclosed in a slight cocoon about one inch below the surface of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from October till April. It is very common in\r\nmost situations where its food-plant is found and, owing to its pale\r\ncolour, is readily seen when flying in the evening twilight. Specimens may\r\nalso be taken in the daytime resting with outspread wings on the trunks of\r\ntrees and on fences, where they are much more easily detected than many\r\nother species.\r\n\r\nMr. Meyrick thinks that this insect will also be found in Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 9.--VENUSIA, Curt.\r\n\r\n  \"Face smooth.

(Plate II., fig.\r\n  13, head of _V. verriculata_; figs. 25 and 26, neuration of _V.\r\n  undosata_.)\r\n\r\nWe have three species represented in New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\nVENUSIA VERRICULATA, Feld.\r\n\r\n(_Cidaria verriculata_, Feld. cxxxi. 20. _Panopæa verriculata_, Meyr.,\r\nTrans.

According to\r\nMr. Fereday the moth always rests on the dead leaves of the plant, keeping\r\nits wings in such a position that the lines are continuous with the\r\nparallel veins of the dead leaf, which they precisely resemble in\r\nappearance. We have, I think, in this species a most instructive instance\r\nof special adaptation to surrounding conditions; and the action of natural\r\nselection, in preserving favourable variations of colour and habit, appears\r\nto be here unmistakably indicated. Had our investigations been confined to\r\nthe examination of cabinet specimens only, we might {54}have long remained\r\nin the dark as to the explanation of such an unusual type of wing-marking.\r\n\r\n\r\nVENUSIA XANTHASPIS, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Hermione xanthaspis_, Meyr., Trans.

Inst. xvi. 61. _Aulopola\r\nxanthaspis_, Meyr., ib. xviii. 184.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VI., fig. 32 [M].)\r\n\r\nThis handsome insect has occurred in the South Island at Mount Arthur and\r\nat Lake Guyon.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is a little over 1 inch. _The fore-wings are\r\n  bright yellow; there is a broad pale reddish-brown band on the costa; a\r\n  conspicuous oval dark brown spot above the middle_, often touching the\r\n  costal band; a double series of minute brown dots near the termen. The\r\n  hind-wings are pale yellow, with a double series of minute brown dots\r\n  parallel to the termen.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in January, February, and March. It is\r\napparently a rare species. Mr. Fereday has six specimens taken at Lake\r\nGuyon, and I have two specimens captured on the Tableland of Mount Arthur,\r\nat an elevation of about 3,500 feet. These comprise, I believe, all the\r\nspecimens at present taken.\r\n\r\n\r\nVENUSIA UNDOSATA, Feld.\r\n\r\n(_Cidaria undosata_, Feld. cxxviii. 2. _Epiphryne undosata_, Meyr., Trans.\r\nN. Z. Inst. xvi. 60.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VI., fig. 33 [M], 34 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis neatly marked little insect has occurred at Napier and Palmerston in\r\nthe North Island; and at Nelson, Mount Hutt, Christchurch, Dunedin, and\r\nLake Wakatipu in the South Island.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is hardly an inch. _All the wings are pale\r\n  yellow with a variable number of fine jagged reddish-brown transverse\r\n  lines, which are usually most distinct towards the termen._ The\r\n  fore-wings have a broad band of reddish-brown along the costal edge; a\r\n  blackish dot above the middle just touching the costal band, and a small\r\n  brown mark near the apex. The hind-wings have a minute black dot a little\r\n  above the middle.\r\n\r\nThis species is rather variable: in some specimens the transverse lines are\r\nmuch broader, forming bands of reddish-brown; in others the whole of the\r\nwings are dull reddish-brown, except a small yellow area near the base;\r\nwhilst others are _entirely dull greyish-brown with the transverse lines\r\nvery faint_, intermediate varieties between all these forms also occurring.\r\n\r\nThe larva, according to Mr. Purdie,[31] is about ½ inch long, feeding on\r\nthe Ribbonwood (_Plagianthus betulinus_). The ground colour is green, with\r\nthe dorsal and lateral stripes white. The dorsal stripe is interlined with\r\nshort black dashes, and there is a dark blotch about the ninth segment. The\r\ndorsal and lateral stripes may be margined with purplish-red. The under\r\nside is green. The larvæ were found in April.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from November till February, and frequents\r\nforest. According to my experience it is rather a local species, although\r\nplentiful where found. Mr. Meyrick states that it is \"very common in bush,\r\nfrom August to February, and in May.\"[32]\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 10.--ASAPHODES, Meyr.\r\n\r\n  \"Face with a tuft or hardly projecting scales.

The hind-wings have a brown central dot and two\r\n  transverse lines. The cilia of all the wings are brownish.\r\n\r\nThis species varies considerably in the distinctness of the brown markings,\r\nand there is occasionally a transverse line near the base of the\r\nfore-wings.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in February and March, and frequents open\r\ncountry, often at elevations of from 2,000 to 4,000 feet above the\r\nsea-level. It is, I think, rather a local species, though abundant where\r\nfound.

The fore-wings are dull\r\n  ochreous; there is a small curved brown patch near the base; then a pale\r\n  band, followed by a very broad brown central band, paler in the middle;\r\n  there is a very sharp projection on the outer edge of the central band, a\r\n  conspicuous black dot in the centre of the wing, and a series of minute\r\n  black dots on the termen.

The fore-wings are dull\r\n  ochreous; there is a series of fine brown and reddish wavy transverse\r\n  lines near the base, forming a rather broad basal band; then a pale\r\n  central area containing a blackish dot above the middle; next, a very\r\n  distinct band made up of several fine wavy grey lines, with a rounded\r\n  projection near the middle; this is followed by numerous pale brown\r\n  curved marks forming more or less broken transverse lines; _there is\r\n  always an oblique slaty patch below the apex_, and a series of minute\r\n  dots on the termen. The hind-wings are ochreous brown, slightly darker\r\n  towards the base, with numerous indistinct wavy brown lines. _The apex of\r\n  the fore-wing is very pointed and slightly hooked downwards; the termen\r\n  is bowed near the middle._ The female is much duller and more uniform in\r\n  colour than the male, and the antennæ are simple.\r\n\r\nThis species is very variable. Some male specimens have several more or\r\nless distinct white markings on the middle of the fore-wings; the\r\ntransverse bands also differ considerably in both size and intensity. The\r\nfemales are not so variable; but in some specimens the bands on the\r\nfore-wings are almost absent, whilst others have the fore-wings rich brown,\r\nwith a very conspicuous dark central band.\r\n\r\n  {56}The eggs when first deposited are pale yellow. They turn dark\r\n  reddish-brown for some days before the young larva emerges.\r\n\r\n  The young larva is rather stout, dark brownish-black with numerous fine\r\n  parallel ochreous lines; the whole body is covered with rather long\r\n  bristles.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from October till April, and frequents forest,\r\nwhere it is generally very abundant. It is a difficult insect to identify\r\non the wing, and in consequence is often captured under a misapprehension.\r\n\r\nThis species probably hibernates in the imago state during the winter\r\nmonths, as we may often observe specimens abroad on mild evenings, at that\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n\r\nASAPHODES PARORA, Meyr.\r\n\r\n  (_Harpalyce humeraria_, Meyr.

The apex of the wing slightly projects, and the termen is\r\n  arched. The hind-wings are very pale greenish-ochreous; there is an\r\n  obscure dusky transverse line in the middle. _The female has the\r\n  fore-wings much browner; there are several additional rows of white dots\r\n  and two conspicuous white spots above the middle._\r\n\r\nThe species is rather variable. In many specimens the dorsal half of the\r\nfore-wing is much paler than the costal half.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from November till March, and frequents dense\r\nforest.

Inst. xvi. 71.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VII., fig. 22 [M], 23 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis species has occurred at Wellington in the North Island; and in the\r\nSouth Island at Akaroa, Christchurch, and Dunedin.\r\n\r\n  {58}The expansion of the wings is about 1-3/8 inches. The fore-wings of\r\n  the male vary _from pale pinkish-grey to pale greenish-grey_; there is an\r\n  obscure darker basal area, a rather broad central band, _formed of\r\n  numerous shaded, wavy, dark grey lines, which are generally absent\r\n  towards the middle of the band_; there is a black dot above the middle;\r\n  the termen is shaded with dark grey, and there is an oblique pale mark\r\n  near the apex. The hind-wings are grey with a few very faint wavy lines.\r\n  The cilia of all the wings are pinkish-grey. _The female is dull\r\n  yellowish-grey, with the markings very indistinct._\r\n\r\nBoth sexes vary slightly in the ground colour, and in the intensity of the\r\nmarkings. Mr. Purdie has pointed out that the species is very liable to\r\nfade, and hence it appears to vary more than is actually the case.[33]\r\n\r\n  The eggs are oval, pale yellow, changing first to orange, and then to\r\n  dull grey before hatching. The young larva, when first emerged, is pale\r\n  greyish-brown and very slender. Later on the caterpillar becomes dull\r\n  olive-green speckled with black; there are two paler stripes just below\r\n  the middle of the back, then a fine black line, followed by a very fine\r\n  white one, then a broad pink stripe on the side; below this is a broad\r\n  black line followed by a white line and two fine black ones. The larva is\r\n  moderately stout, and the two prolegs are very close together.\r\n\r\n  The larva, when full-grown, measures about ¾ inch in length. The general\r\n  colour is dull reddish-brown, often greenish-tinged. The back and sides\r\n  are marked with numerous slightly waved fine black lines; there is a\r\n  double series of black dots down the back, a broad black lateral line,\r\n  followed by a fine white line. The under side of the larva is\r\n  pinkish-brown; the head greenish-brown speckled with black. The\r\n  caterpillar is obscurely marked, and very variable. It is often clouded\r\n  with greenish colouring.\r\n\r\nThe food-plant is watercress.\r\n\r\nThe pupa, which is enclosed in a slight cocoon constructed of earth and\r\nsilk, is found on the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect is most abundant in December, and is attracted by light.\r\nIt seems to be about during the entire year, as Mr. Meyrick states that he\r\nhas taken numerous specimens from May till September, and hence concludes\r\nthat it is essentially a winter species.[34] I can to some extent confirm\r\nthis observation, as I have also found the insect during the winter,\r\nalthough not commonly. It is probable that there are several broods in the\r\ncourse of a year, and that the species hibernates as an imago.\r\n\r\nRegarding the synonymy of this species Mr. Meyrick remarks that \"_C.\r\nardularia_, Gn., is the male and _C. inamænaria_, Gn., the female of this\r\nspecies. _C. subidaria_, Gn., quoted by Butler as a synonym, is an\r\nAustralian species, and not identical.\"[35]\r\n\r\n\r\nXANTHORHOE OROPHYLA, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Epyaxa orophyla_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xvi. 71.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VII., fig. 24 [M], 25 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis  fine  species  has  occurred  in  the South Island at Nelson, Castle\r\nHill, Mount Hutt, Dunedin and Lake Wakatipu.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings of the male is 1¼ inches, of the female 1-3/8\r\n  inches. _The fore-wings of the male are pale brownish-grey_; there is an\r\n  obscure bent blackish line near the base, _a moderately broad central\r\n  band bounded by two very distinct shaded blackish lines, the basal one of\r\n  which is not curved_; the termen is shaded with darker grey, and there is\r\n  an oblique pale mark near the apex. The hind-wings are pale grey tinged\r\n  with ochreous.\r\n\r\n  The female is slightly darker than the male; and there are numerous wavy\r\n  pale and dark grey lines filling up the entire wing on each side of the\r\n  central band.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in December, January, and February. It frequents\r\nopen country on the mountain sides, at elevations of from 2,500 to 4,000\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n{59}I observed it in great abundance on the Humboldt Range at the head of\r\nLake Wakatipu, where it frequented the damp rocky precipices which were\r\nfringed with a luxuriant growth of Alpine plants. At Castle Hill it\r\noccurred much less commonly, so that it would appear to be most plentiful\r\nin the extreme south of New Zealand. The colouring is protective when the\r\ninsect is resting on rock surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nXANTHORHOE SEMIFISSATA, Walk.\r\n\r\n  (_Coremia semifissata_, Walk. 1320. _Coremia ypsilonaria_, Gn., E. M.

Inst. xvi. 72.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VII., fig. 26 [M], 27 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis extremely pretty insect is very common, and generally distributed\r\nthroughout the country.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about an inch. The fore-wings of the male\r\n  are _pale pink_; there are several wavy brown lines near the base, _a\r\n  very distinct brown central band, narrowest near the middle, but much\r\n  broader on the costa than on the dorsum_; the centre of this band is\r\n  paler towards the costa; the termen is shaded with brown, except near the\r\n  apex of the wing; _the veins are dotted in black. The hind-wings are\r\n  bright ochreous with numerous wavy darker lines._ The female is darker in\r\n  colour than the male, the central band is broader; _there are numerous\r\n  brown and pink wavy lines on each side of the central band, and the\r\n  principal veins are marked in pale ochreous_. The grey transverse lines\r\n  on the hind-wings are much more distinct in the female than in the male.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from September till April, and is very common in\r\nrather open forest districts, usually frequenting undergrowth on the edges\r\nof the denser forest. It is often one of the earliest of the _Notodontina_\r\nto appear in spring, and its advent is then especially welcome to the\r\ncollector after the long inaction of winter. It is evidently closely allied\r\nto _X. orophyla_, which appears to be the southern and Alpine\r\nrepresentative of this interesting insect. _Coremia ypsilonaria_, Gn., is\r\nthe male, and _Cidaria delicatulata_, Gn., is the female of this species.\r\n\r\n\r\nXANTHORHOE LOPHOGRAMMA, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Xanthorhoe lophogramma_, Meyr., Trans. Ent. Soc. Lond. 1897, 386.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VII., fig. 47 [M], 48 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis species was discovered at Castle Hill in January, 1893.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1-1/8 inches. The insect differs from\r\n  _X. semifissata_ in the following respects: In the male the general\r\n  colour is slightly duller, _the outer edge of the central band on the\r\n  fore-wings is more indented, and the veins are not dotted in black_. In\r\n  the female the markings on the fore-wings are less distinct, the veins\r\n  are not marked in pale ochreous, the outer edge of the central band is\r\n  more deeply indented, and there is a darker shading near the termen than\r\n  in _X. semifissata_. _The hind-wings of both sexes are dark ochreous,\r\n  without any transverse markings._\r\n\r\n\r\nXANTHORHOE CHLAMYDOTA, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Epyaxa chlamydota_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xvi. 72.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VII., fig. 28.)\r\n\r\nThis very handsome species has occurred at Wellington in the North Island,\r\nand at Christchurch and Akaroa in the South Island.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1¼ inches. The fore-wings are pale\r\n  ochreous, _with two broad, dark, purplish-brown bands. The first, which\r\n  is at the base, is slightly paler near the body, and strongly curved\r\n  outwards towards the termen_; it is followed by several very fine pale\r\n  brown transverse lines. _The second band is very broad, and is situated\r\n  near the middle of the wing; its inner edge is curved inwards, and its\r\n  outer edge has two rounded projections, one very large about the middle,\r\n  and {60}another much smaller near the dorsum_; the middle portion of this\r\n  central band is considerably paler than the edges; _the two projections\r\n  of the central band are bordered with bright red_. The upper part of the\r\n  termen is ochreous, with several faint brown marks; the lower part is\r\n  dull grey. The hind-wings are dark ochreous, with a few obscure\r\n  purplish-grey markings; the termen of the hind-wing projects slightly\r\n  near the middle, and is rather jagged.\r\n\r\nThe species varies a little in the depth of its colouring, but the markings\r\nappear to be constant. The perfect insect appears from November till April.\r\nIt chiefly frequents forest, but is not a common species. At present, more\r\nspecimens have been found in the Wellington Botanical Gardens than\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nXANTHORHOE STINARIA, Gn.\r\n\r\n(_Camptogramma stinaria_, Gn., E. M. M. v. 92. _Larentia stinaria_, Meyr.,\r\nTrans. N. Z. Inst. xvi. 78.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VII., fig. 29 [M].)\r\n\r\nThis species has occurred in the South Island at Christchurch, Dunedin, and\r\nat the foot of Mount Hutt.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is barely 1 inch. _All the wings are deep\r\n  ochreous; the fore-wings have an oblique white line running from the\r\n  dorsum near the base, towards the middle of the wing; this line is edged\r\n  with blackish-brown towards the dorsum; there is a very conspicuous white\r\n  transverse line at about three-fourths shaded with brown towards the\r\n  body_; the apex of the fore-wing slightly projects. The hind-wings have\r\n  no markings.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in December and January. It seems to be fairly\r\ncommon, frequenting _Carex subdola_.[36]\r\n\r\nDescribed and figured from a specimen kindly given to me by Mr. Fereday.\r\n\r\n\r\nXANTHORHOE MNESICHOLA.\r\n\r\n(_Larentia mnesichola_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z.

Mr. Meyrick states that it is rather\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\n\r\nXANTHORHOE PRÆFECTATA, Walk.\r\n\r\n  (_Acidalia præfectata_, Walk. 781. _Acidalia subtentaria_, Walk. 1610.\r\n  _Acidalia absconditaria_, Walk. 1611; Butl., Cat. pl. iii. 21. _Larentia\r\n  præfectata_, Meyr., Trans.

The hind-wings have a row of\r\n  very obscure dots across the middle, and several rows of very faint grey\r\n  marks close to the termen. The face and collar are brown, and there is\r\n  sometimes an extremely faint brown tinge on the costal edge of the\r\n  fore-wings. The body is pure white.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in November, December, January, and February. I\r\ndo not think it is a very common species, and at present I have only\r\nobserved it on the Dun {61}Mountain near Nelson, at an elevation of about\r\n2,700 feet above the sea-level. Here I took several specimens on the\r\nflowers of an Alpine veronica in the dusk of evening, and saw several\r\nothers, which I was unable to capture. Mr. Meyrick has taken it on Mount\r\nArthur at an elevation of 4,500 feet, and Mr. Fereday states that it\r\nfrequents swampy places near Christchurch.\r\n\r\n\r\nXANTHORHOE NEPHELIAS, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Larentia nephelias_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xvi. 78.)\r\n\r\nThis species was discovered by Mr. Meyrick in the South Island at Arthur's\r\nPass, West Coast Road, and he has since taken it on Mount Arthur.\r\n\r\n  \"_Male, female_.--The expansion of the wings is 32-34 mm.

Inst. xvi. 79.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VII., fig. 33 [M], 34 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis large and conspicuous species has occurred in the South Island at\r\nMount Arthur, Arthur's Pass, Lake Guyon, and Lake Wakatipu.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings of the male is 1-5/8 inches, of the female 1½\r\n  inches. _The fore-wings are dull yellowish-brown, with numerous slightly\r\n  waved oblique black and white transverse bands; one very broad white band\r\n  is situated near the middle, and another at about three-fourths; there is\r\n  a broad longitudinal reddish-brown line on the costal edge, in which the\r\n  transverse lines almost disappear_; there is also a pale, somewhat\r\n  triangular, area at the apex. The hind-wings are very pale\r\n  greyish-ochreous. The cilia of all the wings are very pale ochreous. The\r\n  female is duller and paler than the male.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from December till March, and frequents grassy\r\nslopes on the mountain sides, at elevations of from 3,000 to 4,000 feet. I\r\nobserved this insect in great abundance on the Humboldt Range at the head\r\nof Lake Wakatipu, but have not found it at any of the other Alpine\r\nlocalities I have visited, so I imagine that it is a rather local species.\r\n\r\n\r\nXANTHORHOE CLARATA, Walk.\r\n\r\n  (_Larentia clarata_, Walk. 1197; Butl., Cat. pl. iii. 14. _Cideria\r\n  pyramaria_, Gn., E.

The hind-wings are bright ochreous.\r\n  _The cilia of all the wings are white, strongly barred with\r\n  yellowish-brown_.\r\n\r\nThere is slight variation in the details of the markings, but the species\r\ncan always be immediately recognised.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in December, January, and February. It frequents\r\nopen grassy places at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,500 feet, and is\r\noften extremely abundant in these situations.\r\n\r\n\r\nXANTHORHOE COSMODORA, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Larentia cosmodora_, Meyr., Trans.

Inst. xvi. 79.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VII., fig. 35 [M], 36 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis very beautiful species has occurred at Wellington in the North Island,\r\nis common and generally distributed throughout the South Island, and has\r\nalso been found at Stewart Island.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1 inch. _The fore-wings are bright\r\n  green; there is a darker area at the base edged with a jagged white line;\r\n  then a paler band followed by a very broad darker green central band\r\n  edged with very jagged white lines, and containing several white patches\r\n  in the middle, one of which is situated close to the costa and encloses a\r\n  black dot; beyond this central band there is a paler area, then an\r\n  interrupted darker green band edged with white towards the termen_. There\r\n  is an oblique pale mark from the apex of the wing. The hind-wings are\r\n  very pale ochreous, sometimes slightly tinged with green; there are\r\n  several obscure rows of dusky spots.\r\n\r\n  The white markings included in the central band are rather variable.\r\n\r\n  The egg is smooth, oval, and pale green in colour.\r\n\r\n  The young larva is orange-brown, becoming greenish-brown soon after\r\n  emergence. The full-grown larva is dark brown above and pale brown\r\n  beneath, the two colours being sharply separated on the sides by a broken\r\n  white line. A series of V-shaped markings is situated on the back, each\r\n  mark enclosing a paler area. Several fine black wavy lines traverse the\r\n  darker portions of the larva, and a dark mark, edged with black beneath,\r\n  is situated on each segment just above the ventral surface.\r\n\r\nThe food-plant is watercress.\r\n\r\nThe pupa is enclosed in a frail cocoon on the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from October till March, and frequents forest.\r\nIt is often dislodged from dense undergrowth during the daytime, and may be\r\nfound in the evening on the blossoms of the white rata. It is very much\r\ncommoner in some years than in others; but occasionally several seasons\r\nwill pass without our noticing a single specimen of this attractive insect.\r\nThe colouring is extremely protective when the moth is resting on\r\nmoss-covered tree trunks.\r\n\r\n\r\nXANTHORHOE ADONIS, n. sp.\r\n\r\n(Plate VII., fig. 49 [M].)\r\n\r\nThis extremely beautiful insect has occurred in the South Island at Castle\r\nHill, and at Lake Wakatipu.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1 inch. _The fore-wings are vivid green_;\r\n  there is a broad, wavy, black transverse line near the base; a somewhat\r\n  broken line at about one-third, much broader on the costa and edged with\r\n  white towards the base; _a very conspicuous broad black line at\r\n  two-thirds, shaded towards the base, and sharply edged with white towards\r\n  the termen_; between this line and the termen there are several black\r\n  marks, forming another extremely broken transverse line. _The hind-wings\r\n  are pale orange-brown, with a faint grey central band_.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in January. It frequents forests at elevations\r\nof from 1,000 to 2,000 feet above the sea-level, but it is not common.\r\n\r\nMr. Meyrick regards this insect as identical with _Xanthorhoe beata_.\r\n\r\n\r\nXANTHORHOE CHLORIAS, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Larentia chlorias_, Meyr., Trans.

The\r\n  hind-wings are pale brownish-ochreous; there are numerous, rather faint,\r\n  wavy, blackish, transverse lines, which are much more distinct near the\r\n  dorsum. There is a series of distinct black dots on the termen of both\r\n  fore- and hind-wings.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears during the winter months from March till August.\r\nIt is rather a scarce species, but on mild evenings it is sometimes taken\r\nat light.\r\n\r\n\r\nXANTHORHOE HELIAS, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Larentia helias_, Meyr., Trans.

The colouring of the fore-wings is beautifully\r\nadapted for protection on lichen-covered banks, rocks, or fences, where\r\nspecimens may often be found resting with closed wings during the daytime.\r\nThis species flies rather freely at evening dusk, and may then be taken\r\nplentifully at sugar, blossoms or light. It is, however, a difficult matter\r\nto procure specimens in really good condition for the cabinet, as the\r\ninsect is so extremely restless when confined in a box that if it is not\r\nkilled at once, it will speedily injure itself during its struggles to\r\nescape.

Lond. 1877, 391, pl. xlii. 9.\r\n  _Statira homomorpha_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xvi. 91. _Statira\r\n  enysii_, ib. xvii. 65. _Stathmonyma enysii_, ib. xviii. 184.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VIII., fig. 28.)\r\n\r\nThis species has occurred in the South Island on the Dun Mountain near\r\nNelson, and at Mount Hutt.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1 inch. The fore-wings are\r\n  greyish-brown, with numerous wavy blackish transverse lines; there is\r\n  usually a wavy yellowish transverse stripe near the base, and another\r\n  broader and more conspicuous stripe near the termen; the termen itself is\r\n  broadly shaded with dark brown. The hind-wings are orange-yellow; there\r\n  is a small dusky brown area near the base, then a faint straight\r\n  transverse line, followed by a slightly waved conspicuous dark brown\r\n  line; there is a very wavy broad dark brown line near the termen, and the\r\n  termen itself is narrowly edged with dark brown.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in January and February, and frequents stony\r\nsituations on the mountains, at elevations of from 2,500 to 4,000 feet. I\r\nhave taken numerous specimens on the \"Mineral Belt,\" Dun Mountain, but have\r\nnot yet met with it elsewhere. This insect is probably often mistaken\r\nduring flight for _Notoreas brephos_, from which it may easily be\r\ndistinguished by its _larger size, paler colouring, and simple antennæ of\r\nthe male_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDASYURIS ANCEPS, Butl.\r\n\r\n  (_Fidonia anceps_, Butl., Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond. 1877, 392, pl. xliii. 3.\r\n  _Statira anceps_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xvi. 91. _Stathmonyma\r\n  anceps_, ib. xviii. 184.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VIII., fig. 29.)\r\n\r\nThis species has been taken in the South Island at Mount Arthur, Castle\r\nHill, and Arthur's Pass.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1-1/8 inches. _The fore-wings are\r\n  bluish-grey; there are four wavy dark grey transverse lines_, the three\r\n  lines nearest the base are double, and the line nearest the termen is\r\n  shaded towards the base. _The hind-wings are pale yellow_; there is a\r\n  small dusky area near the base, then a slightly curved grey line,\r\n  followed by two curved dark grey lines {70}close together; there is a\r\n  series of irregular blotches near the termen, and the termen itself is\r\n  broadly edged with black near the apex of the wing, and narrowly near the\r\n  tornus. The cilia of all the wings are bluish-grey, barred with dusky\r\n  black.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in January and February, and frequents bare\r\nrocky situations on the mountains, at elevations of from 4,000 to 5,000\r\nfeet. On one occasion I met with this species very plentifully, though in\r\npoor condition, on Mount Peel, near Mount Arthur; but subsequent visits\r\nhave led me to think that, as a rule, it is rather a scarce species. The\r\nbluish-grey colouring of the fore-wings affords this moth a most efficient\r\nprotection from enemies, whilst resting on the rocky ground which it always\r\nfrequents.\r\n\r\nApart from special characters, the fainter colouring of this insect will at\r\nonce distinguish it from any of the numerous allied species.\r\n\r\n\r\nDASYURIS PARTHENIATA, Gn.\r\n\r\n(_Dasyuris partheniata_, Gn., E. M. M. v. 93; Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst.\r\nxvi. 92.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VIII., fig. 30 [M], 31 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis bright-looking species has occurred at Wellington in the North Island,\r\nand at Mount Arthur and Mount Hutt in the South Island.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1-1/8 inches. _The fore-wings are\r\n  bright orange-yellow; the base is speckled with black and dull green\r\n  scales; there is a rather indistinct band at about one-third; a broad\r\n  wavy dark brown band a little beyond the middle, with a projection\r\n  towards the termen, followed by a clear space and another broad irregular\r\n  dark transverse band_; the termen is broadly bordered with dark brown,\r\n  which is often almost continuous with the last-named transverse band.\r\n  _The hind-wings are bright orange; there is a large speckled area near\r\n  the base edged with a curved black line, followed by a clear space, and\r\n  an interrupted dark brown transverse line considerably beyond the\r\n  middle_; the termen is rather narrowly edged with a dark brown line, wavy\r\n  towards the base of the wing. The cilia of all the wings are yellow\r\n  barred with black.\r\n\r\n  The species varies considerably in the extent of the dark markings,\r\n  especially on the fore-wings.\r\n\r\n  The egg is oval and white, without sculpture.\r\n\r\n  The young larva, which is very attenuated, has sixteen legs. Its colour\r\n  is pale yellowish-brown above, and dull ochreous beneath. The food-plant\r\n  is unknown.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from October till March, and frequents open,\r\ngrassy situations. At Wellington, during October and November, it is common\r\non the cliffs close to the shores of Cook's Strait, flying very rapidly on\r\nhot, sunny days, which renders its capture very difficult in such steep\r\nsituations. Mr. Fereday's specimens were obtained amongst the tussock grass\r\nat the foot of Mount Hutt. The insect was also found plentifully on the\r\nslopes of Mount Arthur, at an elevation of about 4,500 feet above the\r\nsea-level, and also on the Tararua Range in the North Island.\r\n\r\n\r\nDASYURIS HECTORI, Butl.\r\n\r\n  (_Euclidia hectori_, Butl., Proc.

The hind-wings\r\n  have three or four {71}indistinct darker transverse lines, and a very\r\n  broad terminal shading; there are two, more or less distinct, fine, wavy,\r\n  white lines, the first a little below the middle, and the second near the\r\n  termen; the cilia are dark grey barred with pale grey. _On the under side\r\n  all the wings are dark blackish-grey, traversed by six broad, wavy\r\n  whitish lines._\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in December, January and February, and frequents\r\nrocky crags on mountains, at elevations of from 4,700 to 5,700 feet above\r\nthe sea-level. It delights to rest on blackened rocks in the hottest\r\nsunshine, but dashes away with the greatest rapidity on the approach of the\r\ncollector, so that it is generally rather difficult to capture.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 14.--NOTOREAS, Meyr.\r\n\r\n  \"Face roughly haired.

(See Plate II., fig. 43, fore-wing of _Notoreas\r\n  brephos_.)\r\n\r\nThis interesting genus, of which we have no less than fifteen species,\r\ncomprises a number of gaily coloured little insects, chiefly inhabiting\r\nmountain regions. All the species are day-fliers, and most of them only\r\nappear during the hottest sunshine. Mr. Meyrick regards the genus\r\n_Notoreas_ as most closely approaching to the ancestor of the family\r\n_Hydriomenidæ_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTOREAS INSIGNIS, Butl.\r\n\r\n  (_Aspilates insignis_, Butl., Proc.

The hind-wings are bright\r\n  ochreous speckled with brown near the base._ The female has the wings\r\n  rather narrower than the male, and the ground colour is paler.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in January. Mr. Fereday's specimens, which\r\nformed the basis for the above figure and description, were captured on a\r\nbare mountain side at an elevation of about 4,000 feet. Mr. Hawthorne has\r\ndirected my attention to the remarkable similarity existing between the\r\nmarkings on the fore-wings of this species and those on _Xanthorhoe\r\nstinaria_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTOREAS ORPHNÆA, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Pasithea orphnæa_, Meyr., Trans.

Ent. Soc. Lond., 1897, 386.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VIII., fig. 27.)\r\n\r\nThis little species has been taken in the South Island on the Craigieburn\r\nRange, near Castle Hill.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about ¾ inch. _All the wings are very dark\r\n  blackish-brown; the fore-wings have five slender wavy white transverse\r\n  lines. The hind-wings have three white transverse lines_, the first near\r\n  the base, the second near the middle, and the third, which is very\r\n  slender and considerably broken, near the termen. _The cilia of all the\r\n  wings are white, barred with blackish-brown._\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect was captured in January, amongst a varied growth of\r\nstunted Alpine vegetation, at an elevation of about 5,600 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTOREAS MECHANITIS, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Pasithea mechanitis_, Meyr., Trans.

Inst. xvi. 86. _Notoreas\r\nmechanitis_, ib. xviii. 184.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VIII., figs. 9, 10, 11, varieties.)\r\n\r\nThis insect has occurred in the South Island at Mount Arthur, Arthur's Pass\r\nand Mount Hutt.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 7/8 inch. _All the wings are dark\r\n  brownish-black. The fore-wings have an almost straight transverse yellow\r\n  or white stripe near the base, edged with black towards the body; a\r\n  rather wavy stripe at about one-third, edged with black towards the\r\n  termen; then several irregular yellowish or white spots or marks,\r\n  followed by a very distinct white stripe, somewhat projecting towards the\r\n  termen near the middle; there is a broken fine yellow line near the\r\n  termen._ The hind-wings have a shaded white or yellow transverse line\r\n  near the base, another near the middle, a third, considerably finer and\r\n  often broken, near the termen. The cilia of all the wings are white\r\n  shaded with grey near the base, _but with no distinct bars_.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from January till March, and flies with great\r\nactivity in the hottest sunshine. It frequents grassy mountain sides at\r\nelevations ranging from 3,000 to 4,500 feet above the sea-level, and in\r\nthese situations it is often very abundant.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTOREAS PARADELPHA, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Pasithea paradelpha_, Meyr., Trans.

The species is said to be\r\n  distinguished from the preceding \"by the barred cilia, the absence of any\r\n  clear yellow colouring, the less prominent angulation of the post-median\r\n  line and the more elongate wings.\"[39] (Meyrick.)\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in December, January and February. In habits it\r\nexactly resembles _Notoreas mechanitis_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTOREAS PERORNATA, Walk.\r\n\r\n(_Fidonia perornata_, Walk. 1672. _Pasithea perornata_, Meyr., Trans. N.

It is extremely abundant on the\r\ncoast hills in the neighbourhood of Wellington. It also occurs commonly at\r\nKekerangu, and is occasionally found on mountains as high as from 3,000 to\r\n4,000 feet above the sea-level. I have observed that all the Wellington\r\nspecimens have the transverse lines on the fore-wings narrow and mostly\r\nwhite; those from Mount Arthur broad and white, those from Kekerangu and\r\nLake Wakatipu broad and orange-yellow. The last-named forms approximate\r\nmost closely to some of the very yellow varieties of _Notoreas\r\nparadelpha_.[40]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTOREAS STRATEGICA, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Pasithea strategica_, Meyr., Trans.

T. L. Travers.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1-3/8 inches. _The fore-wings are dull\r\n  yellowish-brown, becoming blackish-brown near the base; there are two\r\n  broad white transverse lines near the base, the outermost slightly\r\n  curved, then a dull orange shading, followed by a very broad, outwardly\r\n  bent, white transverse band, edged with black towards the base_; between\r\n  this band and the termen there is a fine wavy white transverse line. _The\r\n  hind-wings are dull yellowish-brown near the base, becoming blackish\r\n  towards the termen; there is a small cream-coloured area near the base,\r\n  then two rather broad, slightly irregular, cream-coloured bands, and a\r\n  rather fine wavy white line near the termen._ The cilia of all the wings\r\n  are white, barred with blackish-brown.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in January.\r\n\r\nDescribed and figured from the type specimen in Mr. Fereday's collection.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTOREAS CALLICRENA, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Pasithea callicrena_ Meyr., Trans.

The fore-wings are _dark\r\n  bluish-grey_, with numerous slender, wavy, blackish transverse lines, and\r\n  a distinct blackish dot above the middle. The hind-wings are _bright\r\n  orange_, speckled with grey near the base and dorsum; there are from two\r\n  to four very fine, wavy, broken, blackish, transverse lines, and the\r\n  termen is narrowly bordered with black.\r\n\r\n{75}The perfect insect appears in January, frequenting shingle flats on the\r\nmountain sides, at about 4,000 feet above the sea-level. It flies rapidly\r\nin the hottest sunshine, and, when it alights on the stones, is extremely\r\ndifficult to find. The brilliant hind-wings, which are very conspicuous\r\nwhen the moth is flying, quite disqualify the eye from detecting the\r\nextremely obscure object, which the insect instantly becomes when resting\r\nwith its fore-wings alone exposed. This method of increasing the value of\r\nprotective tints by means of bright colours temporarily displayed was very\r\nclearly described, I believe for the first time, by Lord Walsingham in his\r\naddress to the Fellows of the Entomological Society of London, in January,\r\n1891. It is certainly well exemplified by this and several other species of\r\nthe genus _Notoreas_, and it will be at once noticed by the collector, how\r\nextremely difficult it is to follow these active little moths, as they fly\r\nwith short and rapid flight over the grey rocks and stones, with which\r\ntheir fore-wings so completely harmonize; the momentary glimpse obtained of\r\nthe brilliant hind-wings so completely deceives the eye, that there is much\r\nmore difficulty in marking the spot where the insect alights, than would\r\nhave been the case if the brilliant colour had never been displayed.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTOREAS VULCANICA, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Pasithea vulcanica_, Meyr., Trans.

The fore-wings are _very dark\r\n  blackish-grey_; there is a rather narrow black transverse line near the\r\n  base, another at about one-third; then a small black dot, followed by a\r\n  wavy, rather broad, black band, and two cloudy wavy black transverse\r\n  lines near the termen. The hind-wings are _very dark orange; there is a\r\n  large black basal patch, then a broad black band joining the basal patch\r\n  near the dorsum; beyond this is a fine black line, then another broad\r\n  black line followed by a very fine wavy line of the orange ground colour;\r\n  the termen is very broadly margined with black_.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from January to March.

The fore-wings are dark grey;\r\n  there is a wavy black line near the base, two similar lines enclosing a\r\n  very broad central area, with a black dot a little above the middle;\r\n  beyond this there is a more or less distinct wavy band of pale grey or\r\n  brown; there are several obscure wavy blackish lines near the termen. The\r\n  hind-wings are bright orange, dotted with grey near the base and dorsum,\r\n  with from two to four more or less distinct wavy black transverse lines,\r\n  generally rather narrow; the termen is moderately broadly bordered with\r\n  black.\r\n\r\nThis insect is extremely variable, and, so far as I can judge from an\r\nextensive series, several of the varieties appear to indicate that both\r\n_Notoreas zopyra_ and _N. vulcanica_ may ultimately have to be ranked as\r\nvarieties of _N. brephos_, but the evidence on this point is not yet\r\nconclusive enough to render such a course at present desirable.\r\n\r\n{76}The perfect insect appears from December to March. It is very active,\r\nand is extremely fond of settling on roads or bare ground in the hot\r\nsunshine, instantly darting away on the approach of an enemy. It is also\r\ncommon on the mountains, and is often found at elevations of from 3,000 to\r\n4,000 feet above the sea-level.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTOREAS OMICHLIAS, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Pasithea omichlias_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xvi. 90. _Notoreas\r\nomichlias_, ib. xviii. 184.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VIII., fig. 25.)\r\n\r\nTwo specimens of this dull-looking little species were captured at Castle\r\nHill, by Mr. J. D. Enys.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 7/8 inch. _All the wings are dark grey_;\r\n  the fore-wings have several obscure blackish marks near the base, _a dull\r\n  black spot on the costa at about one-third with a yellowish centre;\r\n  beyond this there are four similar spots forming a transverse band_, and\r\n  several more or less conspicuous wavy blackish lines near the termen. The\r\n  hind-wings have several obscure wavy blackish transverse lines near the\r\n  base and dorsum; the cilia are pale grey, obscurely barred with darker\r\n  grey.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect was taken \"high up\" on the mountains, probably at an\r\nelevation of about 5,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThis species is probably often overlooked through being mistaken for\r\n_Xanthorhoe cinerearia_.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 15.--SAMANA, Walk.\r\n\r\n  \"Face loosely haired.

According to Mr. Meyrick, who made a cursory examination of it, the\r\nspecies differs from _S. falcatella_ in the following respects:--\r\n\r\n  The first dark line runs from the dorsum near the base to below the costa\r\n  before the middle; the lower extremity of the second line is connected\r\n  with the tornus by an oblique streak.\r\n\r\n\r\n{77}Family 2.--STERRHIDÆ.\r\n\r\n  \"Face smooth.

The\r\nfood-plant is unknown.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in January, February and March. In the late\r\nsummer and autumn it frequents dried-up, weedy pastures, where it is often\r\nextremely abundant. Straggling specimens, which have probably hibernated\r\nduring the winter, may also be taken in the early spring.\r\n\r\nMr. Meyrick states that this species occurs very commonly in New South\r\nWales, Victoria, and Tasmania, and that there is no difference between\r\nAustralian and New Zealand specimens.[41]\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily 3.--MONOCTENIADÆ.\r\n\r\n  \"Hind-wings with vein 5 fully developed, parallel to 4, rising from about\r\n  or below middle of transverse vein, 8 free or anastomosing shortly near\r\n  base or seldom from near base to beyond {78}middle (then without areole\r\n  of fore-wings), approximated to upper margin of cell to middle or\r\n  beyond.\" (See Plate II., figs. 44 and 45.)\r\n\r\n  \"Ovum subcylindrical, smooth.

The\r\n  hind-wings have a very obscure dark central line.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in February. It occurs quite commonly on the\r\ntrack to the Dun Mountain, near Nelson, frequenting openings in the birch\r\nforest, where it may be captured at rest on bare ground in the hot\r\nsunshine, at elevations of from 1,500 to 2,000 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nDICHROMODES GYPSOTIS, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Cacopsodos niger_, Meyr., Trans.

N. Z. Inst. xxiv. 216.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VIII., fig. 39.)\r\n\r\nThis dull-looking little insect has occurred at Paikakariki and Wellington\r\nin the North Island, and at Kekerangu in the South Island.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is ¾ inch. _The fore-wings are dull\r\n  greenish-grey; there is a {79}black, wavy, somewhat broken transverse\r\n  line at about one-third, and another at about two-thirds, enclosing a\r\n  slightly darker central band, with a black dot above middle_; there is\r\n  also a darker shading on the termen, and an obscure wavy paler line. _The\r\n  hind-wings are grey_, with an obscure wavy central line.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in January, February and March.

According to Mr. Fereday it\r\nfrequents the plains near Christchurch, and towards the foot of Mount Hutt.\r\n\r\nDescribed and figured from a specimen in Mr. Fereday's collection.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily 4.--ORTHOSTIXIDÆ.\r\n\r\n  \"Hind-wings with vein 5 fully developed, rising from about middle of\r\n  transverse vein, 8 connected with upper margin of cell by an oblique bar\r\n  towards base.\"--(Meyrick.) (See Plate II., figs. 46 and 47.)\r\n\r\nThis small family is represented in New Zealand by a single genus only. The\r\npeculiar oblique bar connecting vein 8 with the cell towards base, combined\r\nwith the development of vein 5, distinguish it from all other families. If\r\nthere is any chance of confusion with those forms of _Hydriomenidæ_ in\r\nwhich vein 8 is also connected by a bar (though in them the bar is placed\r\nbeyond and not before the middle of cell), the absence of the\r\ncharacteristic areole of the _Hydriomenidæ_ will be a further test.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 1.--EPIRRANTHIS, Hb.\r\n\r\n  \"Face with appressed scales.

Ent. ii.\r\n  496. _Ploseria alectoraria_, Hdsn., Manual N. Z. Ent. 86.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VIII., figs. 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, and 47, varieties; Plate III., fig.\r\n24, larva.)\r\n\r\nThis species has occurred in tolerable abundance at many localities in both\r\nthe North and the South Islands. It is probably generally distributed\r\nthroughout the country.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is from 1 inch to 1½ inches. The wings range\r\n  in colour from pale yellow to dark orange-brown, dark reddish-brown, or\r\n  even dull brown, with innumerable intermediate tints. There is often a\r\n  central transverse line reaching from the costa of the fore-wing to the\r\n  dorsum of the hind-wing. Many of the varieties are speckled with darker\r\n  colour; others have irregular yellow patches, generally situated on the\r\n  fore-wings just below the apex and on the dorsum near the base; there are\r\n  often two white dots near the apex of the fore-wings.\r\n\r\nMost of the varieties closely resemble the varied hues of fading leaves. In\r\nmany of the forms greyish speckled marks occur on various parts of the\r\nwings, no doubt imitating the irregular patches of mould which are often\r\npresent on dead leaves. One very well-marked variety is bright yellow, with\r\nthe costa rosy and two large white-centred rosy spots arranged transversely\r\non each wing. (See Plate VIII., fig. 47.) All the specimens of this insect\r\nare so extremely variable that it is almost impossible to adequately\r\ndescribe the species. The apex of the fore-wing is always very acute; the\r\ntermen is bowed just below the apex, and is furnished with slight\r\nindentations of variable depth. The termen of the hind-wing is also\r\nfurnished with variable indentations.\r\n\r\n  The egg is oval and much flattened above. When first laid it is pale\r\n  green in colour, but becomes dull olive-green as the embryo develops.\r\n\r\n  The young larva is _very pale green_, with the head brownish-yellow. At\r\n  this early stage its colouring already completely harmonises with that of\r\n  the under side of the leaves of its food-plants, _Pittosporum\r\n  eugenioides_ and _P. tenuifolium_.\r\n\r\n  The full-grown larva is very robust, and about 1 inch in length. Its\r\n  colour is pale green, with numerous yellow dots and a series of diagonal\r\n  yellow stripes on each segment; there is, in addition, a series of broad\r\n  crimson blotches on the back and a small crimson flap projecting from the\r\n  end of the terminal segment; the prolegs and spiracles are also crimson.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable shape and colouring of this caterpillar, in conjunction with\r\nthe peculiar attitude assumed when at rest, affords it complete protection,\r\ncausing it to resemble, in the closest possible manner, one of the buds of\r\nits food-plant. These larvæ grow very slowly, and probably occupy three or\r\nfour months in attaining their full size. They are very sluggish in their\r\nhabits. The pupa is greenish-brown in colour. It is enclosed in a cocoon,\r\nconstructed of two or three leaves of the food-plant, fastened together\r\nwith silk. The insect remains in this condition for three weeks or a month.\r\nThe moth first appears about the end of October, and is met with until the\r\nmiddle of March. It frequents forest, where it is occasionally dislodged\r\nfrom amongst the undergrowth. It is also found in the evening on the\r\nflowers of the white rata. It is, however, rather uncertain in its\r\nappearance, being much commoner in some years than in others.\r\n\r\n\r\nEPIRRANTHIS HEMIPTERARIA, Gn.\r\n\r\n  (_Hemerophila hemipteraria_, Gn. ix. 220, pl. vi. 2. _Xyridacina\r\n  hemipteraria_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xx. 60. _Ploseria hemipteraria_,\r\n  Hdsn., Manual N. Z. Ent. 85.)\r\n\r\n(Plate VIII., fig. 48 [M], 49 [F]; Plate III., fig. 19, larva.)\r\n\r\nThis remarkable-looking species has occurred in the North Island, at\r\nAuckland and Wellington. At present it has not been observed in the South\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\n  {81}The expansion of the wings is from 1-3/8 to 1-5/8 inches. All the\r\n  wings are pale ochreous-brown, with a variable number of minute black\r\n  dots; there are four or five oblique, wavy brown transverse lines on both\r\n  fore- and hind-wings, the central and terminal lines being often slightly\r\n  darker than the others; there is always a black dot in the middle of the\r\n  fore-wing, and a shaded spot near the termen below the apex. The apex of\r\n  _the hind-wing is very pointed and projects downwards; the almost\r\n  straight termen has a series of prominent projections_.\r\n\r\nThis species varies much in the intensity of the markings, and in the\r\nnumber of the black dots on both the fore- and hind-wings. The peculiar\r\noutline of its hind-wings, however, distinguishes it from any other species\r\nwith which I am acquainted.\r\n\r\nThe larva feeds on veronicas in September and October.\r\n\r\n  Its length when full grown is about 1 inch. Some larvæ are green, with a\r\n  broad bluish dorsal line, and two fine yellow lateral lines. Others are\r\n  brown, with a dull yellow dorsal line.\r\n\r\nDuring the daytime these caterpillars firmly clasp the stem of their\r\nfood-plant with their prolegs, and hold the rest of their body rigidly out\r\nfrom the branch. In this position they are very inconspicuous, and may\r\nreadily be mistaken for young leaves or twigs. At night they become much\r\nmore active, and may then be seen walking about and feeding.\r\n\r\nThe pupa is rather robust, with a sharp spine at its extremity. Its colour\r\nis pale olive-brown, with the wing-cases and sides of the abdomen pinkish.\r\nIt is not enclosed in any cocoon, but is merely concealed amongst the dead\r\nleaves and rubbish around the stem of the veronica. The insect remains in\r\nthis state for less than a month, so that the protection of a cocoon would\r\nappear to be unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe moth appears in December and January. It usually frequents gardens and\r\nother cultivated places, probably on account of the number of veronicas\r\nthat are often growing in such situations. It is also attracted by blossoms\r\nand by light, but is not a common species. The colouring and wing-outline\r\nof this moth cause it to very closely resemble a dead leaf, especially when\r\nresting amongst foliage or on the ground. This insect may be occasionally\r\nnoticed abroad on mild evenings in the middle of winter; the females\r\nprobably hibernate and deposit their eggs early in the spring.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily 5.--SELIDOSEMIDÆ.\r\n\r\n  \"Hind-wings with vein 5 imperfect (not tubular) or obsolete, 6 and 7\r\n  usually separate, 8 usually obsoletely connected with upper margin of\r\n  cell near base, approximated to near middle.\" (See Plate II., figs. 51 to\r\n  64.)\r\n\r\n\"A very large family, equally common throughout all regions. It varies\r\nconsiderably in superficial appearance, and is also remarkable for the\r\nvariability of structure of veins 10 and 11 of the fore-wings in many (not\r\nall) species. Imago with body slender to rather stout; fore-wings broad to\r\nrather elongate, triangular; posterior tibiæ of male often enlarged and\r\nenclosing an expansible tuft of hairs. The structure termed the fovea is a\r\ncircular impression on the lower surface of the fore-wings above the dorsum\r\nnear the base, usually placed about the origin of the basal fork of 1_b_;\r\nit is generally confined to the male, and is often sub-hyaline, sometimes\r\nsurmounted by a small thickened gland; it may possibly be a scent-producing\r\norgan. It is strictly confined to that branch of which _Selidosema_ is the\r\ntype, but is not invariably present there.\r\n\r\n  \"Ovum subcylindrical or elongate-ovate, more or less reticulated,\r\n  sometimes ribbed. Larva elongate, more or less slender, with few hairs,\r\n  without developed prolegs on segments 7, 8, and usually 9; often\r\n  remarkably like a twig of its food-plant.

The female has the fore-wings pale\r\n  grey, and the hind-wings dull white; the markings resemble those of the\r\n  male, but the outline of the hind-wing is of the usual form.\r\n\r\nThis insect varies slightly in the depth of its colouring. It may be\r\ndistinguished from the allied species by the peculiar outline of the\r\nhind-wings in the male, and by the pale grey colouring of the female.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from October till March and is very common. It\r\nhas a great liking for the faded fronds of tree-ferns, from which specimens\r\nmay often be dislodged. Both sexes are very abundant at various blossoms\r\nduring the evening, and are also attracted by light. The female is\r\nsometimes observed in the winter months, and probably hibernates.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELIDOSEMA RUDIATA, Walk.\r\n\r\n(_Cidaria rudiata_, Walk. 1420. _Boarmia astrapia_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z.\r\nInst. xxii. 218. _Boarmia rudiata_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xxiii. 101.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IX., fig. 1 [M], 2 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis species is fairly common in the neighbourhood of Wellington, and has\r\noccurred at Dunedin, and at Stewart Island. It is probably generally\r\ndistributed throughout the country.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings of the male is 1½ inches, of the female 1-5/8\r\n  inches. The fore-wings are _very pale ochreous-brown_; there are two\r\n  interrupted jagged transverse lines near the base; a single very\r\n  indistinct line in the middle; a double, nearly continuous jagged\r\n  transverse line beyond the middle; a double jagged line near the termen\r\n  completely interrupted in the middle; there is generally a dark patch on\r\n  the termen just below the apex of the wing. The hind-wings are very pale\r\n  ochreous. There is a series of black dots on the termen of both\r\n  fore-wings and hind-wings, and the termen of the hind-wing is slightly\r\n  indented.\r\n\r\nThis species varies a good deal in size; the specimens from Stewart Island\r\nare {83}considerably larger and have more distinct markings, than those\r\nfound in the vicinity of Wellington.\r\n\r\nThe larva is cylindrical, of even thickness throughout, and almost uniform\r\ndull greyish-brown in colour, occasionally with a series of small oblong\r\nblack marks on segments 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. It feeds on the young leaves and\r\nbuds of the ake ake (_Olearia traversii_). It is extremely difficult to\r\nfind as it almost exactly resembles a twig of its food-plant. It is full\r\ngrown about April.\r\n\r\nThe pupa is concealed in the earth.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from October till March. It seems to prefer\r\ncultivated districts, and is generally observed at rest on garden fences or\r\ntree-trunks. It also frequents flowers in the evening.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELIDOSEMA SUAVIS, Butl.\r\n\r\n  (_Pseudocoremia suavis_, Butl., Cist. Ent. ii. 497. _Pachycnemia\r\n  usitata_, Butl., Cist. Ent. ii. 501. _Pseudocoremia lupinata_, Meyr.,\r\n  Trans. N. Z. Inst. xvi. 98. _Boarmia suavis_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst.\r\n  xxiii. 101.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IX., fig. 3 [M], 4 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis species is very common and generally distributed throughout the\r\ncountry, and has occurred as far south as Stewart Island.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1¼ inches. The fore-wings of the male are\r\n  _dull yellowish-brown, speckled with black_; there are two curved\r\n  transverse lines near the base; a very obscure line near the middle,\r\n  darker on the costa; two doubly curved lines beyond the middle, slightly\r\n  darker on the dorsum; and two very faint jagged lines near the termen.\r\n  The hind-wings are pale ochreous, tinged with brown near the termen. The\r\n  female has narrower wings, shorter body, and is usually duller in colour\r\n  than the male.\r\n\r\nThis insect is rather variable, some specimens of both sexes being much\r\ndarker than others; but all the forms may usually be recognised by their\r\ndull speckled colouring and absence of conspicuous markings.\r\n\r\nThe larva feeds on the white rata (_M. scandens_) and the tawa\r\n(_Beilschmiedia tawa_).\r\n\r\n  Its length when full grown is about 1-1/8 inches. The upper surface is\r\n  dark reddish-brown with numerous blackish stripes and white markings,\r\n  which give it a very variegated appearance; the under side is pale green;\r\n  there are two small tubercles on the back of the eighth segment.\r\n\r\nThe pupa is concealed amongst refuse on the ground, the larva constructing\r\nno cocoon before changing.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from October till April, and may often be\r\nobserved on mild days in the middle of winter. It is common in forest\r\ndistricts, where it is usually seen resting on the tree-trunks, in which\r\nsituation its colouring must afford it efficient protection from many\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELIDOSEMA HUMILLIMA, n. sp.\r\n\r\n(Plate IX., fig. 5.)\r\n\r\nThis inconspicuous-looking insect has occurred at Wellington.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings of the male is about 1-1/8 inches. _The\r\n  fore-wings are dull yellowish-brown; there are three short oblique dark\r\n  brown stripes on the costa, inclined very much towards the termen_; the\r\n  first of these stripes is distinctly double, and the second and third\r\n  partially so; there is an indistinct brown mark just below the apex,\r\n  several slender faint streaks on the veins near the middle of the wing,\r\n  and a very distinct brown shading on the dorsum. The hind-wings are very\r\n  pale ochreous.\r\n\r\nThis species may be readily distinguished from the other species of the\r\ngenus by its small size and by the obliquity of the costal stripes. In _S.\r\nhumillima_ the costal markings slope very rapidly from the base towards the\r\ntermen; in the {84}other allied species these markings are but slightly\r\ninclined, and in some cases slope in the reverse direction.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from December till March. It frequents the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of Wellington, but is not a common species. At\r\npresent I am only acquainted with the male insect.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELIDOSEMA PRODUCTATA, Walk.\r\n\r\n  (_Larentia productata_, Walk. 1197 (?). _Selidosema pungata_, Feld.\r\n  cxxxi. 23. _Selidosema_ (?) _fragosata_, Feld. cxxxi. 29. _Zylobara\r\n  productata_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xvi. 98.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IX., figs. 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 [M] varieties, 11, 12, 13, and 14 [F]\r\nditto; Plate III., fig. 22, larva.)\r\n\r\nThis species is very common, and generally distributed throughout both the\r\nNorth and South Islands. It has also occurred at Stewart Island.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of the wings of the male is 1-3/8 inches, of the female 1-1/8\r\ninches.\r\n\r\n  The fore-wings vary from pale yellowish-brown to rich chocolate-brown;\r\n  there are two curved transverse lines near the base, generally enclosing\r\n  a paler stripe between them; next a broad dark central area; then a wavy\r\n  paler transverse line, usually followed by a very much paler irregular\r\n  band, generally formed by two partially disconnected patches, one on the\r\n  costa and one on the dorsum; there is a jagged, whitish, transverse line\r\n  near the termen, _always broken in the middle_, and often shaded with\r\n  black towards the base of the wing. The hind-wings are ochreous, speckled\r\n  with brown towards the dorsum; there is usually a brown central dot.\r\n\r\nThis is an extremely variable insect. In some specimens there are very\r\nextensive white patches on the wings, whilst in others the colouring is\r\nalmost uniform rich brown, and the characteristic markings can only be\r\ndetected with difficulty. It may, however, be distinguished from the allied\r\nspecies by the _interrupted pale jagged transverse line near the termen and\r\nby the absence of greenish colouring_.\r\n\r\n  The eggs are oval with the surface honeycombed; they are pale green in\r\n  colour.\r\n\r\n  The young larva, when first hatched, is much attenuated, light\r\n  reddish-brown with a broad pale lateral stripe, and a few bristles. The\r\n  full-grown larva measures about 1½ inches in length; it is rather slender\r\n  and has a large hump on the sixth segment. Its colour is dark\r\n  reddish-brown, mottled and striped with dull white and greenish.\r\n\r\nIt feeds on the white rata (_Metrosideros scandens_). During the day it\r\nfirmly grasps a stem of its food-plant with its prolegs, holding the rest\r\nof its body out from the branch in a perfectly straight and rigid position.\r\nWhen in this attitude it so exactly resembles a twig, that, even in the\r\ncase of captive specimens, it is often a matter of the greatest difficulty\r\nto find a caterpillar amongst the branches. Several times I have even\r\ncaught hold of a larva, thinking it to be a twig, so perfect is the\r\nresemblance. At night these larvæ become much more active, and by the aid\r\nof a lantern they may then be seen busily walking about and feeding.\r\n\r\nThe pupa is enclosed in a slight cocoon about two inches below the surface\r\nof the earth. The larvæ of the autumnal brood remain in this condition\r\nduring the winter, but in the case of the spring and summer broods the pupa\r\nstate only occupies a few weeks.\r\n\r\nThe moth appears from November till May. It is very common in forest\r\nregions, and may be observed resting on the trunks of the trees, its pale\r\nyellow hind-wings being completely concealed by the mottled brown\r\nfore-wings. In this position the insect is almost invisible, and the\r\nprotection afforded by its colouring is at once apparent. In the autumn\r\nevenings it is often very abundant at the blossoms of the white rata.\r\n\r\n\r\n{85}SELIDOSEMA ARISTARCHA, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Selidosema aristarcha_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xxiv. 216.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IX., fig. 17 [M], 18 [F]; Plate III., fig. 17, larva.)\r\n\r\nOf this fine species only about a dozen specimens have hitherto been\r\ncaptured, all of which have occurred in the immediate vicinity of\r\nWellington. It is consequently at present a rarity, but future collectors\r\nwill probably find the insect in many other parts of the country.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings varies from 1¼ to 1½ inches. The fore-wings\r\n  are light ochreous-brown; there is a small white-edged brown spot near\r\n  the base; two oblique curved brown transverse lines enclosing between\r\n  them a white space towards the dorsum; a short stripe on the costa, near\r\n  the middle, edged with white towards the base of the wing; a doubly\r\n  curved transverse line beyond the middle, finely edged with white towards\r\n  the base of the wing; there is also a short white-edged brown stripe\r\n  extending from the apex of the wing to the last-named transverse line,\r\n  the two lines enclosing between them a small pale triangular area; there\r\n  are five short longitudinal brown lines running from the termen to the\r\n  outermost of the transverse lines, two of them being tipped with white\r\n  towards the base of the wing. The hind-wings are dull ochreous-brown,\r\n  with two very faint brown transverse lines towards the dorsum, and\r\n  several whitish spots and one brown spot near the tornus. The female is a\r\n  little darker in colour than the male.\r\n\r\nThis insect varies slightly in size.\r\n\r\nThe larva feeds on _Cyathea dealbata_ (tree-fern) in September. Its colour\r\nis dull reddish-brown with an irregular brownish-black blotch on the side\r\nof each segment, and a dark brown dorsal line. It is very sluggish in its\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nThe pupa is concealed amongst moss, &c., on the surface of the ground, the\r\ninsect remaining in this state for about six weeks.\r\n\r\nThe moth appears from September till March, and frequents dense forests. It\r\nhas been dislodged from its food-plant in the daytime, and has also been\r\ntaken on the flowers of the white rata in the evening.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELIDOSEMA MELINATA, Feld.\r\n\r\n  (_Numeria melinata_, Feld. cxxix. 9. _Pseudocoremia indistincta_, Butl.,\r\n  Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond. 1877, 394, pl. xliii. 8. _Pseudocoremia melinata_,\r\n  Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xvi. 99.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IX., fig. 15 [M], 16 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis species is very common, and generally distributed throughout the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings of the male is 1¼ inches, of the female 1½\r\n  inches. The fore-wings are _dull greenish-grey_, with black markings;\r\n  there is a transverse line near the base; another near the middle,\r\n  followed by two broken irregular lines, then a broader, paler area\r\n  sometimes white, followed by a series of jagged pale markings shaded with\r\n  black. The hind-wings are ochreous mottled with pale brown near the\r\n  dorsum; there is a series of black dots on the termen of both fore- and\r\n  hind-wings.\r\n\r\nThis species is extremely variable, but may always be recognised by its\r\ngreenish tinge, and the absence of indentations on the termen of both fore-\r\nand hind-wings.\r\n\r\nThe larva, according to Mr. Purdie, is about ¾ inch long; dull green with\r\ndarker longitudinal striations. It may be beaten from New Zealand broom\r\n(_Carmichælia_) in February. There must be some other commoner food-plant,\r\nas the moth is found in many localities where the New Zealand broom does\r\nnot occur.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from November till March, and is generally very\r\nabundant in all wooded districts. It is also common in birch forests on the\r\nmountain sides, where it may be taken at altitudes of from 3,000 to 4,000\r\nfeet above the sea-level. {86}In the lowlands I have observed as many as\r\nhalf a dozen specimens on a single tree-trunk. Whilst resting in this\r\nsituation they are very inconspicuous, the colouring of the fore-wings\r\nharmonizing perfectly with the insect's surroundings, and the pale-coloured\r\nhind-wings being then entirely concealed by the upper pair. In connection\r\nwith this fact it is very interesting to notice that in all those cases\r\nwhere the hind-wings are exposed to view during repose, they are\r\nprotectively coloured in a similar manner to the fore-wings. It will be\r\nobserved that the two following species of _Selidosema_ exhibit protective\r\ncolouring on both pairs of wings, these being invariably exposed when the\r\ninsects are at rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELIDOSEMA DEJECTARIA.\r\n\r\n  (_Boarmia dejectaria_, Walk. 394. _Boarmia attracta_, Walk. 394. _Boarmia\r\n  exprompta_, Walk. 395. _Tephrosia patularia_, Walk. 422; Butl., Cat., pl.\r\n  iii. 8. _Tephrosia scriptaria_, Walk. 422. _Scotosia erebinata_, Walk.\r\n  1358. _Scotosia stigmaticata_, Walk. 1359. _Scotosia lignosata_, Walk.\r\n  1361. _Gnophos pannularia_, Gn., E.

The fore-wings vary\r\n  from pale ochreous to very dark rich brown; there is an oblique\r\n  transverse line near the base, often enclosing a darker basal area; a\r\n  small dark brown spot in the middle of the wing surrounded by a ring; a\r\n  very oblique, wavy, transverse line beyond the middle, often double\r\n  towards the dorsum, and several irregular markings on the termen; there\r\n  is often a white spot on the middle of the termen, and a pale blotch on\r\n  the apex of the wing. The hind-wings resemble the fore-wings in colour;\r\n  there are two obscure transverse lines near the base; generally forming a\r\n  dark basal area; a wavy line near the middle, and a strongly shaded line\r\n  near the termen. The termen of both the wings is indented, the depth of\r\n  the indentations varying greatly in different specimens.\r\n\r\nThis insect is very variable, but its large size and _oblique transverse\r\nlines_ suffice to distinguish it from any of the other allied species.\r\n\r\nThe larva feeds on a great variety of plants, mahoe (_Melicytus\r\nramiflorus_), white rata (_Metrosideros scandens_), _Solanum aviculare_,\r\nfuchsia (_Fuchsia excorticata_), and _Pennantia corymbosa_ being amongst\r\nthe number. The caterpillar may often be recognised by a large hump, which\r\nis situated on each side of the third segment. Its colouring appears to be\r\nso entirely influenced by its surroundings that a description is\r\nimpossible. For instance, larvæ taken from the pale green foliage of the\r\nmahoe resemble in colour the twigs of that plant; others captured feeding\r\non the white rata are dark reddish-brown, those from _Solanum aviculare_\r\nare purplish slate-colour, whilst those from the fuchsia are pale\r\nolive-green tinged with brown, like the sprouting twigs.\r\n\r\nThe pupa is enclosed in a slight cocoon situated about two inches below the\r\nsurface of the ground. Those larvæ which become full grown in the autumn\r\nremain as pupæ during the winter, but the summer broods only remain in the\r\npupa state a few weeks.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from November till March. It has a great\r\npartiality for resting with outspread wings on the walls of sheds and\r\nouthouses, where it is frequently noticed by the most casual observer. It\r\nis very common in most situations, and may be taken in large numbers at\r\nsugar, light, or blossoms, during the whole of the summer. Its extreme\r\nabundance and great variability, in both the larval and imago states, would\r\nrender it a good subject for a series of experiments, resembling those\r\nconducted by Messrs. Poulton and Merrifield on several allied European\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n\r\n{87}SELIDOSEMA PANAGRATA, Walk.\r\n\r\n  (_Scotosia panagrata_, Walk. 1360. _Angerona menanaria_, Walk. 1500.\r\n  _Epirrhanthis_ (?) _antipodaria_, Feld. cxxvi. 3. _Hyperythra desiccata_,\r\n  Butl., Cist. Ent. ii. 495. _Hyperythra arenacea_, Butl., Cist. Ent. ii.\r\n  495. _Barsine panagrata_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xvi. 100.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IX., figs. 25, 26, 27, and 28 [M] varieties, 29 and 30 [F] ditto.)\r\n\r\nThis species is very common, and generally distributed throughout the\r\ncountry. It has occurred as far south as Stewart Island.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is from 1½ to 1¾ inches. The fore-wings of the\r\n  male vary from pale yellowish-white to rich brown or dark brownish-black;\r\n  there is a jagged transverse line near the base; a large black or white\r\n  spot in the middle of the wing; a doubly curved transverse line beyond\r\n  the middle, then a very jagged transverse line, followed by several paler\r\n  markings, and an obscure line parallel with the termen. The hind-wings\r\n  are paler in colour; there is a slightly curved transverse line near the\r\n  base; a jagged line near the middle, and a very faint line beyond the\r\n  middle. The termen of both fore- and hind-wings is slightly indented. The\r\n  female varies from pale ochreous to dark slate-colour; the markings\r\n  resemble those of the male, but the termen of the wings is more indented.\r\n\r\nThis species is so extremely variable that a more detailed description\r\nwould be useless; its numerous forms may, however, be at once recognised by\r\nthe _unbroken jagged transverse lines of both fore- and hind-wings_.\r\n\r\nThe larva is quite as variable as the perfect insect. When very young it is\r\nbright green, with a conspicuous white dorsal line; as age advances the\r\ncaterpillar becomes dark olive-brown, sometimes striped with paler brown or\r\ngreen, whilst many specimens retain the green colouring throughout the\r\nwhole of their lives. The favourite food-plant is the kawa-kawa (_Piper\r\nexcelsum_), which the larvæ voraciously devour, thus causing the riddled\r\nappearance which the leaves of that plant almost invariably present. These\r\nlarvæ often select a forked twig to rest in, where they lie curled round,\r\nwith the head and tail close together. Other food-plants are _Aristotelia\r\nracemosa_ and _Myrtus bullata_. Those caterpillars found on the latter\r\nplant are strongly tinged with pink, and are consequently very\r\ninconspicuous amongst the young shoots, where they generally feed. The\r\nburrows of the larvæ of _Hepialus virescens_ are frequently utilised by the\r\ncaterpillars, which feed on the _Aristotelia_, as convenient retreats\r\nduring the winter. When full-grown these caterpillars descend to the ground\r\nand construct loose cocoons of silk and earth on the under sides of fallen\r\nleaves. The moth usually emerges in about a month's time, but the autumnal\r\nlarvæ either hibernate or remain in the pupa state throughout the winter.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from October till April. It frequents forest and\r\nis extremely common. It also occurs in great abundance on the white rata\r\nblossoms in the autumn, and specimens may be occasionally seen even in the\r\ndepth of winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 2.--HYBERNIA, Latr.\r\n\r\n  \"Face with appressed scales or short rough scales.

The\r\n  fore-wings have four obscure wavy transverse lines_; the first near the\r\n  base, the second and third near the middle, rather close together, and\r\n  the fourth near the termen, much interrupted; there is a series of black\r\n  dots on the termen. The hind-wings have two very faint transverse lines,\r\n  and a series of black terminal dots; the termen of the hind-wings is\r\n  slightly scalloped. The cilia of all the wings are grey. _The female has\r\n  the wings extremely small and quite useless for flight_; in colour and\r\n  markings they resemble those of the male, except that the transverse\r\n  lines are black and sharply defined.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from July to January.

It has\r\nalso occurred at Palmerston North, and is probably common throughout the\r\nwhole of the North Island. In the South Island it has been taken in the\r\nOtira Gorge, and at Dunedin, Otara and Invercargill.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1-3/8 inches. _The fore-wings of the\r\n  male vary from pale orange-brown to dull yellowish-brown_; there is a\r\n  doubly curved dark brown transverse line near the base; _a broad straight\r\n  line a little before the middle; a very strongly curved line a little\r\n  beyond the middle, and a less strongly curved line near the termen, often\r\n  composed of a series of triangular white dots edged with dark brown_; all\r\n  these lines are much stronger on the costa, and are sometimes almost\r\n  obliterated elsewhere. The hind-wings are pale yellow, with several\r\n  brown-edged white spots at the tornus, and an indistinct line parallel to\r\n  the termen. The apex of the fore-wing is considerably produced, and there\r\n  is a large rounded projection on the termen. The hind-wings have several\r\n  small projections on the termen. In the female the fore-wings are pale\r\n  yellow or orange, the transverse lines and white spots are usually more\r\n  conspicuous, and the projections on the termen of the fore- and\r\n  hind-wings larger.\r\n\r\nThis is a very variable insect, especially in the male, some specimens of\r\nwhich sex are very much clouded and dappled with dark brown both on the\r\nfore- and hind-wings. {89}Many of these darker forms might readily be taken\r\nfor distinct species, when compared with the pale orange-brown variety, but\r\na good series of specimens presents numerous intermediate forms which\r\ncompletely connect these extreme varieties. The females also vary, but are\r\nnever as dark as the males.\r\n\r\nThe larva feeds on _Todea hymenophylloides_, a fern which grows in shady\r\nplaces in the depths of the forest. The length of the caterpillar when full\r\ngrown is about 1¼ inches. It is very variable; some specimens are dull\r\nbrown, with a row of green or pale brown lunate spots down each side, and a\r\ndark brown line down the back. Others are bright green, with a diagonal\r\nreddish-brown stripe on the side of each segment; the segmental divisions\r\nare reddish-brown, intersected by numerous very minute whitish lines.\r\n\r\nThe pupa is enclosed in a loose cocoon on the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from November till March, and is very common in\r\nforest regions. It may often be dislodged from the dead fronds surrounding\r\nthe stems of tree-ferns, and is also met with in great abundance towards\r\nthe end of summer on the blossoms of the white rata.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 4.--SESTRA, Walk.\r\n\r\n  \"Face smooth. Palpi short, rough-haired beneath, porrected. Antennæ in\r\n  male stout, serrate, shortly ciliated.

Hind-wings normal.\"--(Meyrick.) (Plate II.,\r\n  fig. 53, neuration of fore-wing of _Sestra humeraria_.)\r\n\r\nWe have two species in New Zealand.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that my figure of the neuration of _Sestra humeraria_ does\r\nnot precisely agree with Mr. Meyrick's description. The differences in the\r\nresults arrived at are probably due to the variability in structure of\r\nveins 10, 11 (and 12), mentioned when dealing with the characters of the\r\nentire family. Similar slight discrepancies also occur in connection with\r\nthe three following genera.\r\n\r\n\r\nSESTRA HUMERARIA, Walk.\r\n\r\n  (_Macaria humeraria_, Walk. 940. _Lozogramma obtusaria_, ib. 985.\r\n  _Cidaria obtruncata_, ib. 1421. _Sestra fusiplagiata_, ib. 1751.\r\n  _Amastris encausta_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xvi. 105. _Sestra\r\n  humeraria_, ib. xviii. 184.)\r\n\r\n(Plate X., figs. 1 and 2 varieties; Plate III., fig. 20, larva.)\r\n\r\nThis species is very common, and generally distributed throughout both the\r\nNorth and the South Islands; it also occurs plentifully at Stewart Island.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1-3/8 inches. _The fore-wings are pale\r\n  plum-colour_; there is an indistinct, curved, brownish transverse line\r\n  near the base; _a straight dark brown line across the middle, and a\r\n  curved series of blackish dots beyond the middle_; the apex is pointed,\r\n  and the termen has a strong projection a little above the middle. The\r\n  hind-wings are ochreous, with a series of minute brownish dots across the\r\n  middle.\r\n\r\nThis is a variable species. The fore-wings are often much clouded with rich\r\nbrown, and in some specimens scarcely a trace of the original purplish\r\ncolour remains; the central straight transverse line is often absent, and\r\nthe other lines are frequently very indistinct, except on the costa; the\r\ndots on the hind-wings are also often absent, and occasionally specimens\r\nare met with in which all the wings are almost white.\r\n\r\n  The larva is rather elongate, dull yellowish-brown or greenish-brown;\r\n  there is a very broad dark brown dorsal line, and several wavy lateral\r\n  lines; the prolegs are black, the spiracles are also black; there is a\r\n  slight hump on the posterior edge of each of the last six segments, the\r\n  hump on the penultimate segment being considerably larger than the\r\n  others. The length of the caterpillar when full grown is about 1 inch.\r\n\r\n{90}It feeds on _Pteris incisa_, a beautiful pale green fern, attaining a\r\nheight of four feet or more, and growing in open situations in the forest.\r\nThis fern is especially abundant on old decaying logs situated amongst\r\nlight brushwood. When disturbed these larvæ immediately drop to the ground\r\nand coil themselves up. In this situation they are very inconspicuous, as\r\ntheir colouring so closely resembles that of the faded fronds or stems of\r\nthe fern.\r\n\r\nThe pupa is buried in the earth about two inches below the surface, the\r\ninsect remaining in this state during the winter months.\r\n\r\nThe moth first appears about September, and continues in great abundance\r\nuntil the end of March or beginning of April. It frequents forest, and is\r\nnoticed most commonly in the neighbourhood of its food-plant. There are\r\nprobably several broods in the course of a year.\r\n\r\n\r\nSESTRA FLEXATA, Walk.\r\n\r\n(_Cidaria flexata_, Walk. 1421.)\r\n\r\n(Plate IX., fig. 37.)\r\n\r\nThis species has occasionally occurred in the neighbourhood of Wellington.\r\nI have no records of its capture elsewhere, but expect it will be found to\r\nbe generally distributed.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1¼ inches. _The fore-wings are bright\r\n  orange-red_; there is a very faint transverse line near the base, darker\r\n  on the costa; a dark red oblong mark on the costa near the middle; and a\r\n  faint transverse line beyond the middle, also darker on the costa. The\r\n  hind-wings are bright ochreous-yellow, with the cilia orange.\r\n\r\nThis insect varies considerably in the intensity of its colouring. It has\r\nlong been considered as merely a variety of _Sestra humeraria_, but as I\r\nhave not observed any intermediate forms, although the two insects\r\nfrequently occur together, I think it may be regarded for the present as a\r\ndistinct species.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from October till December, and is found in the\r\nsame localities as _S. humeraria_.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 5.--GONOPHYLLA, Meyr.\r\n\r\n  \"Face shortly rough-haired.

It has\r\nalso occurred at Nelson and Dunedin, and is possibly generally distributed\r\nthroughout the country.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1½ inches. The fore-wings of the male are\r\n  _rich reddish-brown, mottled with darker_; there are several small white\r\n  marks on the costa; a black dot in the middle of the wing, and _an almost\r\n  straight white transverse line beyond the middle_; outside this line the\r\n  wing is speckled with greyish-white. The hind-wings are pale\r\n  pinkish-brown; there is a black dot in the middle, and a curved blackish\r\n  transverse line a little beyond the middle, being a continuation of the\r\n  transverse line of the fore-wing; beyond this line, and on the dorsum,\r\n  there are generally several small blackish markings. The female has the\r\n  fore-wings {91}orange-red, speckled with darker; there is a doubly curved\r\n  transverse line near the base, and an almost straight transverse line\r\n  near the termen, both dark red; beyond the outer transverse line the wing\r\n  is shaded with dark brown. The hind-wings are pale reddish-orange, with a\r\n  curved blackish transverse line. In both sexes the apex of the fore-wing\r\n  is projecting, and there is a strong angular projection on the termen a\r\n  little before the middle; the termen of the hind-wing has several small\r\n  projections.\r\n\r\nThe variation of this insect is considerable, especially in the male. The\r\nground colour of the fore-wings often inclines to dull brown, or even dull\r\nyellowish-brown; the light and dark mottling, and the greyish markings near\r\nthe termen are sometimes hardly visible; there is often a yellowish blotch\r\nopposite the large angle in the termen of the fore-wing. The hind-wings\r\nalso are very variable in their colouring. All these varieties exist in the\r\nfemale in a less pronounced degree.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears during the first week in February, and is\r\ngenerally over by the middle or end of March. The males are first noticed,\r\nthe females not appearing until about a fortnight later. I have never taken\r\nthis insect in the daytime, and in fact have never seen it except on the\r\nblossoms of the white rata, where, on fine evenings, it is often very\r\nabundant. As yet, however, Wellington is the only locality where I have met\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 6.--DREPANODES, Gn.\r\n\r\n  \"Face with cone of scales.

It has\r\nalso been taken at Taranaki, Christchurch, Dunedin, Invercargill and\r\nStewart Island, and is probably common and generally distributed throughout\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1½ inches. All the wings of the male\r\n  are yellowish-brown; there is a faint transverse line near the base, and\r\n  a conspicuous darker transverse line running from a little before the\r\n  apex of the fore-wing to the middle of the dorsum of the hind-wing; there\r\n  is also a dark spot in the centre of the fore-wing, often containing two\r\n  white dots. In the female, all the wings are slate-coloured; the\r\n  transverse lines are very faintly indicated, and the central dot of the\r\n  fore-wing is reddish-brown. The apex of the fore-wing in each sex is\r\n  conspicuously hooked, and the termen is bowed and sometimes has a very\r\n  slight angle in the middle.\r\n\r\nBoth sexes of this insect are very variable. In the male, the ground colour\r\nranges from dingy-brown to bright orange-brown; the transverse lines differ\r\nmuch in intensity, and in some specimens the central area of the wings\r\nenclosed by them is much darker than either the basal or the marginal\r\nportions; occasionally there is a series of black markings between the\r\nouter transverse line and the termen of the fore-wings, whilst the\r\ntransverse line itself is frequently edged with a band of paler\r\n{92}colouring. The female also varies in the ground colour and in the\r\nintensity of the transverse lines, which are sometimes marked by a few\r\nblack dots.\r\n\r\nThe larva, according to Mr. Purdie, is light grey, cylindrical, about 5/8\r\ninch in length. It may be beaten in February from an undergrowth of\r\n_Carpodetus_ and _Aristotelia_.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from November till March. It frequents dense\r\nforest and is often very abundant. The colouring of the upper and under\r\nsurfaces of its wings, and the shape of the wings are both very protective,\r\ngiving the moth an exact resemblance to a dead leaf. When disturbed, the\r\ninsect adds to this deception by keeping its wings quite motionless and\r\nrigidly extended, and allowing itself to fall through the air like a leaf.\r\nThe resemblance in this case to the inanimate object is very perfect, and\r\nhas no doubt enabled the moth to escape from many enemies. It is, in fact,\r\nan extremely interesting example of the simultaneous development of\r\nstructure and instinct in a useful direction, through the agency of natural\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nThis species is much attracted both by light and by blossoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 7.--AZELINA, Gn.\r\n\r\n  \"Face with some projecting hairs.

(Plate II., figs. 54 and\r\n  55, neuration of _Azelina gallaria_.)\r\n\r\nWe have three species in New Zealand.[42]\r\n\r\n\r\nAZELINA GALLARIA, Walk.\r\n\r\n  (_Selenia gallaria_, Walk. 185, Butl., Cat., pl. iii. 6, 7. _Euchlaena_\r\n  (?) _palthidata_, Feld. cxxxii. 21, 22. _Stratocleis gallaria_, Meyr.,\r\n  Trans.

It has also\r\noccurred at Palmerston North, Makotuku, Christchurch, Dunedin and Stewart\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1¼ inches. The fore-wings of the male vary\r\n  from pale yellowish-brown to bright orange-brown, or reddish-brown; there\r\n  is a wavy transverse line near the base, often obsolete except on the\r\n  costa; another wavy transverse line beyond the middle, also frequently\r\n  obsolete except on the costa; _followed by a very conspicuous straight\r\n  line, often double, running obliquely from a little before the apex to\r\n  the dorsum_; outside this line, near the tornus, there are, in most\r\n  specimens, two black spots or one large rust-red spot; the termen has two\r\n  projections near the apex, inside which there is usually a darker blotch.\r\n  The hind-wings are as variable in colour as the fore-wings; there is one\r\n  wavy line near the base, _followed by an almost straight line_, which is\r\n  a continuation of the straight line of the fore-wing; beyond this line\r\n  the ground colour is generally much darker; the termen itself has no\r\n  projections. The female has broader wings and a shorter body than the\r\n  male; the ground colour and markings are similar to those of the male,\r\n  but are usually more sombre, and the termen of both fore- and hind-wings\r\n  is furnished with a number of prominent projections. The under side of\r\n  the wings in both sexes is beautifully marbled with yellow and\r\n  reddish-brown, and several of the markings of the upper surface are\r\n  faintly indicated.\r\n\r\nThis species, as will be seen from the foregoing, is so extremely variable\r\nthat a more detailed description would be useless, especially as the\r\nstraight, oblique, transverse lines of both fore- and hind-wings will at\r\nonce distinguish it from the two other members of the genus.\r\n\r\n{93}The perfect insect appears from November till March. It frequents dense\r\nforest, and is most abundant at the flowers of the white rata in the\r\nevening. Earlier in the year, before the rata blooms, it may sometimes be\r\ntaken at sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\nAZELINA OPHIOPA, Meyr.\r\n\r\n(_Gonophylla ophiopa_, Meyr., Trans. Ent. Soc. Lond. 1897, 387.)\r\n\r\n(Plate X., fig. 26 [M], 27 [M] variety, 28 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis species has occurred occasionally in the neighbourhood of Wellington,\r\nbut has not yet been recorded from any other locality.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1½ inches. The fore-wings of the male are\r\n  pale orange-brown; there is a doubly toothed shaded transverse line near\r\n  the base, the teeth being marked with two black spots; _a conspicuous\r\n  wavy transverse line runs from the apex to the dorsum_, and is also\r\n  marked with several black dots; the space between the two transverse\r\n  lines is paler than the rest of the wing; there is a row of small black\r\n  dots on the termen, and the termen itself has two small projections. The\r\n  hind-wings are yellowish at the base, becoming orange beyond the middle;\r\n  there is a faint brownish transverse line near the base, and a\r\n  conspicuous wavy transverse line at the middle, marked by a series of\r\n  black dots; this central transverse line divides the yellowish ground\r\n  colour of the basal area, from the orange ground colour of the rest of\r\n  the wing. The female is larger and duller than the male; the fore-wings\r\n  are yellowish drab, with the outer transverse line dull red; there is a\r\n  series of minute black dots on the termen; the hind-wings are dull\r\n  yellow, with a wavy central transverse line.\r\n\r\nThe only variety of this species which has come under my observation is a\r\nmale. In this specimen all the wings are pale yellowish-brown, with very\r\nbroad black transverse lines. (See Plate X., fig. 27.)\r\n\r\nThis insect is evidently closely allied to _Azelina fortinata_. It may,\r\nhowever, be distinguished from that species by the smaller projections on\r\nthe termen of the fore- and hind-wings, and the dotted transverse lines of\r\nthe male.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from January till April. It is met with much\r\nlater in the season than either of the two other species of _Azelina_. It\r\nfrequents forest, and may be found on the blossoms of the white rata, but\r\nis, I think, the rarest of the genus.\r\n\r\n\r\nAZELINA FORTINATA, Gn.\r\n\r\n(_Polygonia fortinata_, Gn., E. M.

It has been taken at Wellington, Nelson, Castle Hill,\r\nAkaroa, Mount Hutt, West Plains and Otara.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1¼ inches. The fore-wings of the male are\r\n  pale orange-brown, with _a doubly toothed black transverse line near the\r\n  base, and a less acutely toothed line beyond the middle_; between these\r\n  there is a black mark on the costa; the termen has two large projections,\r\n  and several smaller ones; between the outer transverse line and the\r\n  termen there are several small black markings. The hind-wings are\r\n  yellowish, clouded with orange-brown towards the termen, which also has\r\n  several projections; there is a faint blackish line near the base, and a\r\n  much stronger black line near the middle, starting from the dorsum and\r\n  reaching about half-way across the wing. The female has the fore-wings\r\n  dark brown, with the central area between the two transverse lines paler;\r\n  the hind-wings are also considerably darker than those in the male.\r\n\r\nThis species varies a little in the depth of the ground colour, but not\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in December, January and February.

The fore-wings of the male are uniform pale brownish-ochreous,\r\n  generally with two transverse series of minute darker brown dots parallel\r\n  to the termen, and two or three similar dots near the middle of the wing.\r\n  There is a series of very small parallel brown lines on the costa. The\r\n  hind-wings are greyish-brown with two very deep indentations in the\r\n  termen. The female has the fore-wings pale grey, and the hind-wings\r\n  darker grey; the markings and outline resemble the male.\r\n\r\nIn a few male specimens I have observed four large black spots on the\r\nfore-wings, two near the base, and two near the termen. All these spots are\r\nsometimes joined together by a very broad black band, which extends along\r\nthe whole of the central portion of the fore-wings. I have also a male\r\nspecimen in which the fore-wings are entirely marbled with dark grey. In\r\nthe female two or three moderately large spots are occasionally present on\r\nthe fore-wings, near the termen. All these varieties appear to be much\r\nscarcer than the typical form.\r\n\r\nThe larva, which feeds on manuka (_Leptospermum_), has ten legs. It is\r\nrather slender, dark brown, mottled with grey and dull red. There are two\r\nlarge tubercles on the sides of the seventh and eighth segments. It is a\r\nsluggish caterpillar and is generally seen in a motionless condition,\r\nclasping the stem of its food-plant with its prolegs, and holding the rest\r\nof its body in a perfectly rigid position like a small branch. The pupa is\r\nenclosed in a cocoon of silk and refuse on the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in January, February and March. It is a\r\nforest-dwelling species, and may often be captured in some numbers, at\r\ndusk, on the flowers of the white rata (_M. scandens_). It is very sluggish\r\nand nearly always drops to the ground when disturbed and feigns death.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 9.--DECLANA, Walk.\r\n\r\n  \"Face roughly haired.

It has occurred at Wellington,\r\nOtaki, and Napier.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings of the male is 1-5/8 inches, of the female\r\n  nearly 2 inches. The fore-wings are _brilliant shining white, with\r\n  numerous black markings_; these consist chiefly of three irregular\r\n  branching transverse bands, and a series of wedge-shaped spots on the\r\n  termen; the larger markings are brownish in the centre. The hind-wings\r\n  are dark grey, becoming almost black on the termen, with a fine wavy\r\n  transverse black line.\r\n\r\nThis species varies considerably in the size and shape of the black\r\nmarkings on the fore-wings, which are often slightly different on the\r\nopposite sides, in the same specimen.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this moth are oval in shape, slightly roughened on the surface\r\nand light blue in colour. They are deposited towards the end of October.\r\nThe young larva escapes by gnawing a hole out of the side.\r\n\r\n  When first hatched it is dull brownish-black, with creamy-white lateral\r\n  lines and prolegs; the head is reddish. It feeds on _Panax arborea_.\r\n  After the first moult the lateral lines become much wider, especially\r\n  towards the head. After the second moult the two dorsal tubercles are\r\n  fully developed, the thoracic segments much swollen and flattened above,\r\n  the latter bearing traces of the black markings of the full-grown larva.\r\n  After the third moult the larva becomes a dark brownish colour inclining\r\n  to chocolate on the dorsal surface. The characteristic markings on the\r\n  penultimate and anal segments of the adult larva now appear, and the\r\n  dorsal tubercles are yellowish in colour; the extra prolegs are very\r\n  small, and are visible as wart-like appendages on the lower surface of\r\n  the tenth segment.\r\n\r\n  The full-grown caterpillar is a remarkable-looking animal. The head is\r\n  very small; the first three segments of the body are enormously swollen\r\n  and flattened above, the flattened portions being white, with several\r\n  small black ring-shaped markings; there is a pair of large yellowish\r\n  tubercles on the dorsal surface of the seventh segment, and two smaller\r\n  ones on the tenth and eleventh segments; the larva is much stouter\r\n  towards the posterior extremity, especially behind the ninth segment; the\r\n  penultimate segment is furnished with a large creamy-white ridge,\r\n  starting on the back and proceeding downwards and forwards; the extra\r\n  pair of prolegs is small and only occasionally used in walking. The\r\n  general colour of the larva is brownish- or blackish-green; the tenth and\r\n  eleventh segments are generally darker, and there are many fine parallel\r\n  lines of darker colouring on the central portions of the larva; the whole\r\n  insect is also speckled with black; the spiracles are red. The larva\r\n  varies a good deal in colour, but its peculiar structure will at once\r\n  distinguish it from any other.\r\n\r\nThese larvæ often coil themselves up when at rest, clinging firmly with\r\ntheir large prolegs to their food-plant. Whilst thus engaged they have a\r\nvery remarkable appearance. I have not yet ascertained the precise object\r\nof the peculiar shape and coloration of this caterpillar. It appears to\r\nresemble very closely a lichen-covered twig, but I suspect in this case\r\nthere is something more special aimed at.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject, it is noteworthy that the flattened\r\nextremities of the elytra of the beetle, _Ectopsis ferrugalis_, closely\r\nresemble in both shape and colour the remarkable anterior segments of the\r\nlarva of _D. atronivea_. As both insects feed on the same plant, and thus\r\nexist under very similar conditions, it is highly probable that the\r\npeculiarities have been independently acquired in each species for similar\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe pupa is enclosed in a light cocoon amongst dead leaves, &c, on the\r\nsurface of the ground.\r\n\r\n{96}The perfect insect appears in February and March, and may sometimes be\r\ntaken at blossoms in the evening. It is also attracted by light, and has\r\nbeen found occasionally, in the daytime, resting on tree-trunks. It\r\nhibernates during the winter, coming abroad again the following spring to\r\nlay its eggs. I have observed that a good many pupæ from the autumnal brood\r\ndo not emerge until September or October, so that the insect evidently\r\nspends the winter both as a pupa and as an imago.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECLANA EGREGIA, Feld.\r\n\r\n(_Chlenias egregia_, Feld. cxxxi. 24; Fereday, Trans.

The\r\n  hind-wings are dull white, darker towards the termen; there are two very\r\n  faint transverse lines.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from November till February.

Inst. xvi. 102.)\r\n\r\n(Plate X., figs. 39 to 43 [M] varieties, 44 to 47 [F] ditto.)\r\n\r\nThis species has occurred very commonly at Wellington, Christchurch and\r\nDunedin. It is probably generally distributed throughout the country.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1-3/8 inches. The fore-wings are pale\r\n  greyish-white with numerous small brownish-black streaks, exhibiting a\r\n  slight concentration near the apex. The hind-wings are dull white,\r\n  clouded with greyish towards the termen.\r\n\r\n  This insect is so extremely variable that I have given descriptions of a\r\n  few of the principal varieties below; all these forms may, however, be\r\n  connected by specimens exhibiting every intermediate gradation both in\r\n  colour and in markings.\r\n\r\n    1. Fore-wings with several large brown spots near the middle.\r\n\r\n    2. Fore-wings covered with numerous black spots (formerly known as\r\n    _Declana nigrosparsa_) (fig. 47).\r\n\r\n    3. Fore-wings with two more or less conspicuous curved black or brown\r\n    lines from costa to dorsum (figs. 41, 42, and 44).\r\n\r\n    4. Fore-wings with these transverse lines joined by two others running\r\n    parallel to dorsum and costa.\r\n\r\n    5. Fore-wings with transverse lines and black spots (fig. 43).\r\n\r\n    6. Fore-wings diffused with dark greyish-black, except two broad bands\r\n    of the original light colour extending from costa to dorsum; hind-wings\r\n    darker than usual (fig. 45).\r\n\r\n    7. Fore-wings with a dark brown central band; hind-wings clouded with\r\n    dark brown towards termen, with a faint curved transverse line near the\r\n    middle (figs. 39 and 40).\r\n\r\n  All these varieties occasionally have tufts of orange-yellow scales on\r\n  both the wings and on the body, and they also vary in other minor\r\n  particulars (fig. 46).\r\n\r\n  The egg of this insect when first laid is oval in shape and light green\r\n  in colour, becoming bronzy a few days before the emergence of the larva.\r\n  The young larva is very attenuated, with only ten legs. {97}Its colour is\r\n  pale yellow striped with brownish-pink near the segmental divisions. It\r\n  is very active, and does not devour the egg-shell after emergence.\r\n\r\n  The full-grown larva has the body much flattened underneath. In colour it\r\n  is pale brownish-pink, with numerous irregular darker markings, which in\r\n  some specimens almost form two broad subdorsal lines. The under surface\r\n  of the larva is pale green. There is a series of fleshy filaments of a\r\n  pinkish-brown colour along each side of the insect, and an extra pair of\r\n  prolegs on the ninth segment.\r\n\r\nThis caterpillar is, however, very variable, its colouring appearing to\r\ndepend largely on its surroundings. The favourite food-plants are\r\n_Leptospermum ericoides_ and _Aristotelia racemosa_. The larvæ found on the\r\nformer plant are usually pale yellowish-brown, whilst those from the latter\r\nare much darker brown, often mottled with grey like the stems of the\r\n_Aristotelia_. A specimen I once found on a mountain beech (_Fagus\r\ncliffortioides_), the gnarled stem and branches of which were covered with\r\ngrey lichens and mosses, was mottled with the most beautiful shades of\r\ngreenish-grey. These larval varieties are very interesting, and in order to\r\ntest the direct influence of food on the colouring of the larvæ, I once\r\ndivided a batch of eggs deposited by a single female into two equal parts,\r\nand fed one half on _Aristotelia_, and the other half on _Leptospermum_.\r\nThe differences in colouring between the two lots of larvæ thus treated\r\nwere, however, of the most trivial description. This somewhat surprised me\r\nat first, as I had previously observed quite distinct varieties on each\r\nplant, when found in a state of nature. Hence I am now disposed to think\r\nthat these differences have been brought about gradually, by natural\r\nselection acting on larvæ feeding on the same plant for a large number of\r\ngenerations. By this means a sufficient amount of variation might be\r\naccumulated, to cause the closest possible approximation in colouring to\r\nthe stems of the several food-plants. It is also noteworthy that many of\r\nthese food-plants grow in widely dissimilar localities, so that the free\r\ninter-breeding of insects dependent on them would not be likely to occur,\r\nand thus the peculiarities of colouring adapted to the stems of each\r\nfood-plant would not be disturbed by the effects of inter-breeding.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the foregoing experiment it is also interesting to\r\nobserve, that the specimens fed on _Aristotelia_ matured much more rapidly\r\nthan those on _Leptospermum_; the former plant evidently being the more\r\nnourishing food for the larvæ. Also that out of the batch fed on\r\n_Aristotelia_ 28 became moths, of which 12 were males and 16 females;\r\nwhilst out of those fed on _Leptospermum_ only 24 became moths, of which 15\r\nwere males and 9 females. In all other respects, excepting food-plant, the\r\ntwo lots of larvæ were subjected to identical treatment.\r\n\r\nDuring the day this larva rests quietly attached to the stem of its\r\nfood-plant, where it is very difficult to detect, as the filaments so\r\nclosely embrace the twig or tree-trunk that the whole insect exactly\r\nresembles a swelling in the stem.\r\n\r\nThe pupa of _D. floccosa_ is enclosed in a loose cocoon on the surface of\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears about September, and continues in more or less\r\nabundance until the end of April. There are most likely several broods in a\r\nseason, and, as we frequently meet with specimens of the moth on mild days\r\nin the middle of winter, it probably also hibernates.\r\n\r\nThis insect is usually observed at rest on fences and tree-trunks, where\r\nits grey mottled colouring causes it to closely resemble a patch of lichen.\r\n\r\n\r\n{98}DECLANA JUNCTILINEA, Feld.\r\n\r\n(Plate X., fig. 37 [M], 38 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis species has occurred occasionally in the Wellington Botanical Gardens.\r\nIt is no doubt found elsewhere, but I cannot give any other localities with\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings of the male is 1¼ inches, of the female 1-3/8\r\n  inches. The fore-wings of the male are pale yellowish-brown, with two\r\n  indistinct, irregular, transverse darker lines near the base, a\r\n  conspicuous curved line a little beyond the middle, followed by a\r\n  blackish patch; _there is a series of very fine parallel oblique brown\r\n  stripes on the costa_, and several series of curved, blackish marks near\r\n  the termen, and on the central portions of the wing. The fore-wings of\r\n  the female are much greyer, with a conspicuous, irregular, white streak\r\n  from the apex towards the dorsum, the central portions of the wing are\r\n  white, and, with the exception of the fine, oblique costal stripes, the\r\n  other markings of the male are usually absent. The hind-wings of both\r\n  sexes are dull ochreous. The strongly pectinated antennæ of the male, and\r\n  the oblique costal markings of both sexes, will at once distinguish this\r\n  species from any of the varieties of _Declana floccosa_.\r\n\r\nThis moth varies in the intensity of the markings, which in some specimens\r\nare very indistinct.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from November till March. It is generally\r\ncaptured on blossoms in the evening.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECLANA HERMIONE, n. sp.\r\n\r\n(Plate X., fig. 36.)\r\n\r\nA single specimen of this very handsome insect was captured at Khandallah\r\nnear Wellington.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1¼ inches. _The fore-wings are bright\r\n  purplish-brown, clouded with silvery-white towards the middle and on the\r\n  termen_; there is a very fine oblique chocolate-brown mark at the base, a\r\n  broad broken transverse band at about one-eighth; a fine curved\r\n  transverse line at about three-fourths, shaded towards the termen; there\r\n  are four wavy brown marks on the termen inclining obliquely upwards\r\n  towards the costa; the termen itself is narrowly edged with\r\n  chocolate-brown. The cilia are silvery mixed with brown; the termen is\r\n  very strongly bowed. The hind-wings are grey, shaded with purplish-grey\r\n  towards the termen; the cilia are grey.\r\n\r\nThe type specimen was captured at sugar in November.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECLANA GRISEATA, n. sp.\r\n\r\n(Plate X., fig. 32 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis species has occurred at Wellington in the North Island, and at Lake\r\nWakatipu in the South Island.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings of the male is 1-1/8 inches, of the female\r\n  1-3/8 inches. _The fore-wings are dull slaty-grey, with a slightly paler\r\n  central band_; there is a fine oblique wavy transverse line at about\r\n  one-fourth, another at about one-half, and indications of a third at\r\n  about three-fourths; _numerous minute black streaks are thickly scattered\r\n  over the wing, especially near the base and the termen_; the outline of\r\n  the termen is very slightly scalloped. The hind-wings are pale grey,\r\n  darker near the termen. The body is very dark slaty-grey. _The antennæ of\r\n  the male are not bi-pectinated._\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in January, and is attracted by light. It is a\r\nscarce species.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECLANA NIVEATA, Butl.\r\n\r\n(_Declana niveata_, Butl., Cist. Ent. ii. 500. _Atossa niveata_, Meyr.,\r\nTrans. N. Z.

N. Z. Inst.\r\nxxii. 213.)\r\n\r\n(Plate XIII., fig. 1.; Plate III., figs. 13 and 14 varieties of larvæ.)\r\n\r\nThis handsome insect often occurs in the northern portions of the North\r\nIsland, but becomes very rare southward of Napier and New Plymouth. In the\r\nSouth Island it has been taken at Nelson, and recently a very mutilated\r\nspecimen of what appears to be this species has been found by Mr. Philpott,\r\nnear West Plains, Invercargill. With these exceptions I have not heard of\r\nits appearance in any other localities in the South Island.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 3½ inches. The fore-wings are\r\n  greyish-brown with several irregular, darker markings near the base; and\r\n  a broad, dark, central band; beyond the central band there is a very\r\n  irregular, pale grey, toothed line. The hind-wings are yellowish-grey,\r\n  with four transverse, darker stripes, the outermost one strongly toothed.\r\n  The head and thorax are dark grey, paler on the back, with two\r\n  conspicuous tufts of pale grey hair on the shoulders. _The abdomen is\r\n  grey, striped on the sides with rose-colour and black._\r\n\r\nThe larva feeds on _Convolvulus_. Like many of the caterpillars of the\r\n_Sphingidæ_, there are two very distinct varieties: one is bright green,\r\nwith white spiracles, and a series of diagonal yellow lines above them; the\r\nother is dull yellowish-brown, with broad blackish-brown dorsal and ventral\r\nlines, and a series of triangular blackish spots above the spiracles, which\r\nin this variety are jet-black. In both these forms of {100}larvæ the anal\r\nhorn is dark red tipped with black, and the skin is covered with numerous\r\nfine wrinkles. The length of the caterpillar when full grown is 3½ inches.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle or end of February these larvæ generally bury themselves\r\nin the ground, where they are transformed into pupæ. They remain in that\r\ncondition until the following summer.\r\n\r\nThe pupa is about 2 inches in length and is of a dark mahogany-brown\r\ncolour. It is furnished with a large curved process, projecting from the\r\nlower side of the head, and containing the enormous proboscis of the future\r\nmoth.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in November and December. It flies with\r\nincredible velocity at evening dusk, and is often observed hovering over\r\nflowers, and whilst poised in the air above them, extracts the honey with\r\nits long proboscis. Mr. A. P. Buller has very kindly furnished me with the\r\nfollowing interesting notes on the habits of this species, as observed by\r\nhim in the Auckland district:--\r\n\r\n\"During the summer of 1879 I came across _S. convolvuli_ in great numbers,\r\nnear Ohinemutu, in the Hot Lake district, frequenting at dusk a tall,\r\ndelicately perfumed meadow flower (_Oenothera biennis_, commonly called the\r\nevening primrose). They were to be seen on the wing soon after sundown, and\r\non warm, still evenings literally swarmed. It was an extremely pretty sight\r\nto watch their rapid movements as they darted from flower to flower, never\r\nalighting, and keeping up a constant vibration of their wings as they\r\nprobed the yellow blossoms. They appeared to be extremely local, for I only\r\nmet with them on a few of the grassy slopes round the shores of Lake\r\nRotorua. I visited the same locality two years later, at the same season,\r\nand only occasionally saw one, although the evening primrose was in full\r\nbloom at the time. In 1882 I captured several at flowers of the\r\ntrumpet-tree (_Brugmansia_) in a garden near Auckland. The same summer I\r\nfound large numbers of the larvæ at Waiwera (near Auckland), on a species\r\nof convolvulus growing in profusion on the sandhills in the vicinity.\r\nAlthough the larvæ were so abundant I never came across the perfect insect.\r\nI obtained some twenty or thirty of the pupæ, but unfortunately was never\r\nsuccessful in hatching out the imago. As far as my knowledge goes, this\r\nbeautiful moth is confined to the Auckland and Waikato districts, although\r\nI have heard of a single specimen being taken in Hawkes Bay.\"\r\n\r\nI am also much indebted to Mr. Buller for the loan of a very perfect\r\nspecimen of this moth, expressly lent to me for figuring and describing in\r\nthe present work.\r\n\r\nMr. Meyrick informs us that this insect occurs throughout Europe, Asia,\r\nAfrica, Australia and the islands of the South Pacific, wherever a suitable\r\nsituation is found, and has been met with far out at sea.[43] In America it\r\nis represented by a form which seems to be regarded as specifically\r\ndistinct, but which he thinks is probably identical. If this be the case\r\nthe insect is practically cosmopolitan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{101}III.--THE LASIOCAMPINA.\r\n\r\nNot represented in New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--THE PAPILIONINA.\r\n\r\nThe _Papilionina_ are distinguished by the following characters:--\r\n\r\n  \"Head rough-haired. Ocelli absent. Tongue developed. Antennæ slender,\r\n  dilated apically, forming a gradual or abrupt club. Labial palpi\r\n  moderately long, more or less rough-haired, terminal joint rather\r\n  pointed. Maxillary palpi obsolete. Thorax more or less hairy. Fore-wings\r\n  with 1_b_ simple, 1_c_ absent, 5 usually from or above middle of\r\n  transverse vein. Hind-wings without frenulum, 1_c_ absent, 3 and 4\r\n  usually connate, 8 rising out of cell near base, rapidly\r\n  diverging.\"--(Meyrick.) (See Plate I., figs. 7, 8, 15, 16, 25, 26, 27.)\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most interesting groups of the Lepidoptera. The insects\r\ncomprised in it are popularly known as butterflies, and from their bright\r\ncolouring and conspicuous appearance are always favourites with beginners.\r\nThe _Papilionina_ attain great development in the tropics, especially in\r\nSouth America, where, it is said, a single valley sometimes contains as\r\nmany species as the whole of Europe. In New Zealand there are only fifteen\r\nspecies of butterflies, the group being extremely poorly represented both\r\nhere and in the South Pacific Islands.\r\n\r\nFormerly the _Papilionina_ was known as the _Rhopalocera_, and was regarded\r\nas constituting a division of equivalent value to the remainder of the\r\nLepidoptera, which was termed the _Heterocera_. For some time past\r\nentomologists have, however, practically abandoned this classification of\r\nthe order, the _Heterocera_, or moths, being clearly composed of several\r\ngroups each of equivalent value to the _Rhopalocera_, or butterflies. Mr.\r\nMeyrick states in his 'Handbook of British Lepidoptera' that the\r\n_Papilionina_ \"stands rather conspicuously isolated at the present day, but\r\nthere is little doubt that its origin must be traced to the _Thyrididæ_, a\r\nfamily of the _Pyralidina_.\"\r\n\r\nIn this group the wings are generally held erect in repose, the under\r\nsurface of the hind-wings and the apical portion of the under surface of\r\nthe fore-wings being nearly always protectively coloured, these being\r\nportions of the wings exposed to view when the insect is at rest. There is\r\nan unusual amount of ornamental colouring on the upper surface. The flight\r\nis invariably diurnal. The larva has ten prolegs.\r\n\r\nThe three following families of _Papilionina_ are represented in New\r\nZealand:--\r\n\r\n1. NYMPHALIDÆ.    2. SATYRIDÆ.    3. LYCÆNIDÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\n{102}Family 1.--NYMPHALIDÆ.\r\n\r\n  \"Anterior legs in both sexes much reduced, useless for walking; posterior\r\n  tibiæ without middle spurs. Fore-wings with veins 8 and 9 out of 7.\r\n  Hind-wings with præcostal spur.\" (Plate I., figs. 7 and 8.)\r\n\r\n\"An extremely large family, mainly tropical. The species are of large or\r\nmoderate size, usually dark-coloured, with light or bright bands or rows of\r\nspots.\r\n\r\n\"Ovum cylindrical or sub-conical, ribbed and often reticulated. Larva with\r\npairs of tentacles or more usually series of bristly spines.

Particulars of the early captures of this butterfly are\r\nthus given by Mr. Enys[44]: \"First recorded as a New Zealand insect by Mr.\r\nFereday, in a paper read before the Canterbury Institute, January 2, 1874,\r\nand printed in vol. vi. of 'Transactions.' Mr. Fereday received the\r\nbutterfly from F. H. Meinertzhagen, of Hawkes Bay. Dr. Hector also obtained\r\nit in Westland. It has also been caught near Auckland. In vol. xi. of\r\n'Transactions' Mr. F. W. Sturm records that he first saw this insect, or a\r\nclosely allied one, at the Reinga, up the Wairoa River, Hawkes Bay,\r\nDecember, 1840, or January, 1841. In 1848 he captured a number at the\r\nWaiau, a tributary to that river. Again in 1861 he captured three on the\r\nRangitikei River near Mr. Birch's run. He also records other captures.\"\r\nFrom these records it will be seen that the insect was observed as early as\r\n1840, and it thus seems scarcely probable that it was accidentally\r\nintroduced by man, as Mr. Butler appears to suppose.[45] Recently _A.\r\nerippus_ has occurred many times in the neighbourhood of Cook's Straits. In\r\n1879 several specimens were bred from larvæ found by Mr. C. W. Lee near\r\nWangaehu. In 1881 I captured two specimens near Nelson and saw three\r\nothers. In 1890 two specimens were taken by Mr. R. I. Kingsley, and in\r\nJanuary of the following year I captured two more, all near Nelson. During\r\nthe autumn of 1892 {103}one specimen was taken near Otaki by Mr.\r\nRutherfurd, and several others were seen. The same year a specimen was also\r\ntaken by Sir James Hector at Petone. In 1896, I understand from Mr.\r\nKingsley, several specimens were again seen in the Nelson district.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is from 3¾ to 4¼ inches. Above, all the wings\r\n  are rich orange-brown bordered with black, the veins are also black.\r\n  There are two rows of small white spots round the margins of all the\r\n  wings, and several orange-brown spots near the apex of the fore-wings.\r\n  Beneath, the markings are similar, except that the white spots are\r\n  larger, and the hind-wings are very pale yellowish-brown. The male has a\r\n  black chitinous spot on vein 2 of the hind-wings which is wanting in the\r\n  female; the wing-veins in the male are also slightly narrower.\r\n\r\nThe larva of this insect feeds on most of the different kinds of milkweed\r\n(_Asclepias_), and also upon dogbane (_Apocynum_). A single caterpillar,\r\nfully grown, which was found in a building in the centre of the town of\r\nWellington, formed the subject from which the figures of the metamorphosis\r\nof this insect were taken, but this specimen did not afford sufficient\r\nmaterial for an exhaustive investigation of the life-history. The following\r\naccount, taken from Professor Riley's 'Third Annual Report of the Noxious,\r\nBeneficial, and other Insects of the State of Missouri,' is therefore\r\ninserted:--\r\n\r\n  \"The egg is invariably deposited on the under side of a leaf, and is\r\n  conical and delicately reticulate with longitudinal ribs, and fine\r\n  transverse striæ. It is yellowish when first deposited, but becomes grey\r\n  as the embryo within develops.\r\n\r\n  \"In about five days after laying the egg hatches, and the young larva as\r\n  soon as hatched usually turns round and devours its egg-shell--a custom\r\n  very prevalent with young caterpillars. At this stage it differs\r\n  considerably from the mature larva; it is perfectly cylindrical, about\r\n  0·12 inch long, and of much the same thickness throughout. The head is\r\n  jet black and polished; the colour of the body is pale greenish-white,\r\n  with the anterior and posterior horns showing as mere black conical\r\n  joints, and with two transverse-oval black warts, nearer together, on the\r\n  first joint. It is covered with minute black bristles, arising from still\r\n  more minute warts.\r\n\r\n  \"When the young larva is three or four days old a dusky band appears\r\n  across the middle of each joint, and by the fifth or sixth day it spins a\r\n  carpet of silk upon the leaf, and prepares for its first moult. After the\r\n  first moult the anterior horns are as long as the thoracic legs, the\r\n  posterior ones being somewhat shorter; the characteristic black stripes\r\n  show quite distinctly, but the white and yellow stripes more faintly.\r\n  After this it undergoes but slight change in appearance, except that the\r\n  colours become brighter, and that at each successive moult the horns\r\n  become relatively longer. There are but three moults, and the intervals\r\n  between them are short, as the larvæ frequently acquire their full growth\r\n  within three weeks from hatching.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the larva is full grown it spins a little tuft of silk to the\r\nunder side of whatever object it may be resting upon, and after entangling\r\nthe hooks of its hind legs in the silk it lets go the hold of its other\r\nlegs and hangs down, with the head and anterior joints of the body curved.\r\nIn this position it hangs for about twenty-four hours, during which the\r\nfluids of the body naturally gravitate towards the upturned joints, until\r\nthe latter become so swollen that at last, by a little effort on the part\r\nof the larva, the skin bursts along the back behind the head. Through the\r\nrent thus made the anterior portion of the pupa is protruded, and by\r\nconstant stretching and contracting the larval skin is slipped and crowded\r\nbackwards until there is but a small shrivelled mass gathered around the\r\ntail. Now comes the critical period--the culminating point.\r\n\r\n\"The soft and supple chrysalis, yet showing the elongate larval form with\r\ndistinct traces of its prolegs, hangs heavily from the shrunken skin. From\r\nthis skin {104}it is to be extricated and firmly attached to the silk\r\noutside. It has neither legs nor arms, and we should suppose that it would\r\ninevitably fall while endeavouring to accomplish this object. But the task\r\nis performed with the utmost surety, though appearing so perilous to us.\r\nThe supple and contractile joints of the abdomen are made to subserve the\r\npurpose of legs, and by suddenly grasping the shrunken larval skin between\r\nthe folds of two of these joints as with a pair of pincers, the chrysalis\r\ndisengages the tip of its body and hangs for a moment suspended. Then with\r\na few earnest, vigorous, jerking movements it succeeds in sticking the\r\nhorny point of its tail into the silk, and firmly fastening it by means of\r\na rasp of minute claws with which that point is furnished. Sometimes severe\r\neffort is needed before the point is properly fastened, and the chrysalis\r\nfrequently has to climb by stretching the two joints above those by which\r\nit is suspended, and clinging hold of the shrivelled skin further up. The\r\nmoment the point is fastened the chrysalis commences, by a series of\r\nviolent jerkings and whirlings, to dislodge the larval skin, after which it\r\nrests from its efforts and gradually contracts and hardens. The really\r\nactive work lasts but a few minutes, and the insect rarely fails to go\r\nthrough with it successfully. The chrysalis is a beautiful object, and as\r\nit hangs pendant from some old fence-board or from the under side of an\r\n_Asclepias_ leaf, it reminds one of some large eardrop; but, though the\r\njeweller could successfully imitate the form, he might well despair of ever\r\nproducing the clear pale-green and the ivory-black and golden marks which\r\nso characterize it.\r\n\r\n\"The chrysalis state lasts but a short time, as is the case with all those\r\nwhich are known to suspend themselves nakedly by the tail. At the end of\r\nabout the tenth day the dark colours of the future butterflies begin to\r\nshow through the delicate and transparent skin, and suddenly this skin\r\nbursts open near the head, and the newborn butterfly gradually extricates\r\nitself, and stretching forth its legs and clambering on to some surrounding\r\nobject, allows its moist, thickened, and contracted wings to hang\r\nlistlessly from the body.\"\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in March and April, hibernated specimens being\r\nmet with in the spring. It is a most striking species on the wing, and one\r\nwhich, when once seen, is not likely to be forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOSIA BOLINA, L.\r\n\r\n  (_Diadema nerina_, Butler, Butterflies of N. Z., p. 13. Female.--_Papilio\r\n  nerina_, Fabr., Syst. Ent., p. 509, n. 277 (1775); Donovan, Ins. of New\r\n  Holland, pl. 27, fig. 1 (1805). _Papilio iphigenia_, Pap.

Exot., 2, pl. cxc., figs. A, B (1779).)\r\n\r\n(Plate XII., fig. 7 [M], 8 [F], 9 under side.)\r\n\r\nThis fine species appears to be rare in New Zealand, but I think it has now\r\noccurred often enough to entitle it to a place amongst our native\r\nbutterflies. The following is a list of the captures so far as I am able to\r\nascertain them:--\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Eny's 'Catalogue of New Zealand Butterflies'[46] the first\r\nspecimen taken appears to have been a male, which was captured by Dr.\r\nSinclair, of Auckland, and sent to the British Museum before the year 1855.\r\nThe Rev. Richard Taylor also caught  one male specimen in his garden at\r\nWanganui, and saw another, the only {105}two he observed in thirty-four\r\nyears. Dr. Baker saw one in his garden at Christchurch on lilac flowers,\r\nalso a male. Mr. R. W. Fereday[47] records the capture of the first female\r\nspecimen by a son of Mr. Thomas Tanner, near Napier, in January, 1876. On\r\nthe 18th of March, 1885, Mr. R. I. Kingsley[48] took a fine female specimen\r\nin Nelson, and on the 25th of March, 1886, I saw another female specimen in\r\nthe same locality; I also understand that quite a number of specimens of\r\nboth sexes have been recently captured in the neighbourhood of\r\nAuckland.[49]\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing records, I think that there are very good reasons for\r\nregarding this as an indigenous species, as it is very improbable that such\r\na large number of specimens would have been accidentally introduced to the\r\nvarious localities at so many different times.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings of the male is 3½ inches, of the female 4\r\n  inches. On the upper side all the wings of the male are rich\r\n  brownish-black, with a large white blotch in the middle of each,\r\n  surrounded by a patch of brilliant flashing blue; there is also a small\r\n  white spot near the apex of the fore-wings and a series of white\r\n  crescent-shaped markings on the termen of all the wings. The fore-wings\r\n  of the female are brownish-black, with a patch of deep orange-brown near\r\n  the tornus; there is a series of four very large oval white spots on the\r\n  costa, beyond the middle, a smaller white spot near the apex, and three\r\n  rows of small white marks parallel to the termen; the hind-wings are\r\n  brownish-black, with a broad white band across the middle, several small\r\n  white spots, and a double series of white markings parallel to the\r\n  termen; all the wings of the female have brilliant bluish reflections\r\n  near the white spots. On the under side the wings of both sexes are rich\r\n  brown with white markings, and a double series of white crescents on the\r\n  termen.\r\n\r\nThe female appears to be very variable in almost every respect.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in January, February and March. From its large\r\nsize and brilliant colouring it is easily recognised. Although rare in New\r\nZealand, it is very common in Australia. It also occurs in Java, New Guinea\r\nand the Loyalty Islands. A smaller representative is found in Samoa\r\n(_Anosia otaheitæ_, Feld.), which is probably only a variety of this\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe figures and descriptions of this insect are taken from Australian\r\nspecimens, which were kindly forwarded to me by the late Mr. Olliff.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 2.--VANESSA.\r\n\r\n  Eyes hairy. Club of antennæ abrupt. Fore-wings with vein 10 separate.\r\n  Hind-wings with transverse vein present.\r\n\r\n\"A moderate genus, principally characteristic of the Northern Hemisphere.\r\nLarva with six or seven rows of bristly spines. Pupa with angular\r\nprominences, often with golden metallic spots.\"--Meyrick.\r\n\r\nOf this very beautiful and interesting genus we have three species in New\r\nZealand.\r\n\r\n\r\nVANESSA GONERILLA, Fabr.\r\n\r\n  (_Papilio gonerilla_, Fabricius, Syst. Ent. p. 498, n. 237 (1775);\r\n  Donovan, Ins. New Holland, pl. 25, fig. 2 (1805). _Vanessa gonerilla_,\r\n  White in Taylor's New Zealand, pl. 2, fig. 1 (1855).)\r\n\r\n(Plate XII., fig. 5, 6 under side; Plate III., figs. 1 and 2 larvæ, 31 and\r\n32 pupæ.)\r\n\r\nThis handsome insect is the most familiar of New Zealand butterflies. It is\r\nvery common and generally distributed throughout the country.\r\n\r\n  {106}The expansion of the wings varies from 2-3/8 to 2¾ inches. Above,\r\n  all the wings are black, becoming bronzy towards the body. _The\r\n  fore-wings have a band of dark red nearly across the middle, and a series\r\n  of three small blue spots, and three larger white spots near the apex.\r\n  The hind-wings have a broad dark red band near the termen, containing two\r\n  pairs of black spots with blue centres._ On the under side the fore-wings\r\n  are dark brown, with a broad patch of red in the middle, and a very\r\n  conspicuous eye-like mark on the costa, consisting of a black central\r\n  spot surrounded by a blue ring, and encircled by a yellow crescent\r\n  towards the termen. The hind-wings are brownish-grey, with many darker\r\n  and paler markings; the four spots on the upper surface are faintly\r\n  indicated on the under side by blackish rings and central dots; the\r\n  colouring of the under side varies a good deal. It is considerably darker\r\n  and duller in some specimens than in others.\r\n\r\n  The egg, which is deposited on a nettle-leaf, is barrel-shaped,\r\n  ornamented with a series of longitudinal ribs meeting in a central spot\r\n  on the top. It is pale green, with the ribs white. The young larva, when\r\n  first hatched, is dusky-yellow, with the spines black. In about a week it\r\n  moults for the first time, and is then of an almost uniform brown, with\r\n  the lateral lines faintly indicated. Ten days later it again sheds its\r\n  skin, after which time the white lateral markings are considerably\r\n  stronger. The full-grown larva varies from black to reddish-brown, with\r\n  interrupted pale lateral and dorsal lines. On the third and fourth\r\n  segments there are four spines, on the fifth to eleventh seven spines;\r\n  the twelfth segment has six spines, and the thirteenth two spines. There\r\n  are numerous white dots all over the larva. The spines vary from pale\r\n  green to black. The caterpillar is considerably attenuated at each end,\r\n  the central portions being somewhat swollen. Length about 1½ inches.\r\n\r\nThis caterpillar constructs for itself a small tent by fastening together\r\nseveral of the leaves of its food-plant. In this dwelling it can feed,\r\nsafely concealed from all enemies. There are two kinds of nettles\r\nconstituting the food of this insect--one a small plant, which generally\r\ngrows in little patches amongst ferns in the forest (_Urtica incisa_), the\r\nother a large shrub or tree often found in rather open situations near\r\nrivers (_Urtica ferox_). The shrub is easily recognised by the formidable\r\narray of long, white spines which project from the midrib of each leaf. The\r\nlarvæ of _V. gonerilla_ are much more easily collected on the tree nettle\r\nthan on the dwarf species; their leafy tents being easily detected by an\r\nexamination of the foliage. When once discovered the larvæ are best\r\nobtained by cutting off, with a pair of strong scissors, the leaves which\r\nform their habitations. Like most larvæ of the genus _Vanessa_, these\r\ncaterpillars are extremely voracious and soon eat themselves out of house\r\nand home. Those feeding on the tree nettle have an unlimited supply of\r\nleaves available both for food and shelter, but in the case of larvæ, which\r\nare dependent on the dwarf nettle for their supplies, no doubt individuals\r\nmust occasionally die of starvation, as we sometimes observe large patches\r\nof the _Urtica incisa_ completely destroyed by the larvæ of this butterfly.\r\nIn some seasons these larvæ may be found as early as the middle of\r\nSeptember, and continue abundant until the middle or end of January.\r\n\r\nWhen full grown, this caterpillar suspends itself by the tail to a little\r\npatch of silk, which it has spun on the under side of a leaf, having also\r\ndrawn two or three other leaves around it in the same way as the feeding\r\nlarva. In this situation it hangs, with the head and three anterior\r\nsegments slightly curved upwards, for nearly twenty-four hours before the\r\ntransformation to the pupa state occurs. I have often watched these larvæ\r\nchanging, and as their manoeuvres during the process exactly resemble those\r\nof _Anosia erippus_ a special description is unnecessary. The actual\r\ntransformation may be easily observed in this species, as the larvæ are\r\ncommon and {107}can be obtained in large numbers. It is well worth\r\nwatching, and if a good many specimens are kept at once, some of them are\r\nsure to change at a convenient time for observation. The pupa varies from\r\npale yellowish-brown to dark purplish-brown, darker on the wing-cases and\r\nventral surface. The spines on the back are golden. The whole insect is\r\nalso speckled with brown or black dots. The pupa varies considerably in\r\nsize as well as in colour. In this insect the pupa state is of very short\r\nduration, usually only lasting about a fortnight. I am informed by Mr.\r\nHelms that the pupa of _Vanessa gonerilla_ is often destroyed by the common\r\nhemipteron, _Cermatulus nasalis_, which penetrates its shell by means of\r\nits long rostrum, and speedily consumes the liquid internal portions.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect usually emerges early in the morning. It dries its wings\r\nfor a few hours whilst resting on the old nettle-leaves which formed its\r\nhome when a larva. The increasing warmth of the sunshine soon hardens the\r\nwings sufficiently to allow the new-born butterfly to fly away.\r\n\r\nThis insect is very common in most situations from January till April. It\r\nlives through the winter, appearing again on fine days towards the end of\r\nAugust. During the spring and early summer these hibernated individuals\r\noccur in great profusion, a few specimens always remaining until the\r\nearliest of the new ones have emerged; so that about December we may\r\noccasionally observe both hibernated and recent specimens together.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn these butterflies may be seen feeding on the flowers of the\r\nscabious and the white rata, thus preparing for their long winter sleep. In\r\nthe spring, however, the insect is most abundant in the vicinity of the\r\nnettle-plants, where the females are busily engaged depositing their eggs.\r\n\r\nI have noticed that this insect possesses the power of emitting a distinct\r\ngrating or hissing noise, evidently closely resembling the sound, which has\r\nbeen observed to be emitted by several European species of the genus.[50]\r\nThis sound is only made when a specimen is roused from a semi-torpid\r\ncondition; and it is thought that it may be useful to the insect for the\r\npurpose of intimidating intruders during its period of hibernation.\r\n\r\nThis butterfly is a rapid flier and may often be seen pursuing a straight\r\ncourse high above the tree-tops, apparently migrating in search of fresh\r\nbreeding-grounds. It appears to have a singular liking for hill-tops, and a\r\nspecimen which has selected one of these places will keep on returning to\r\nthe same spot, after being repeatedly frightened away. In such situations,\r\nif the weather be calm and sunny, we may frequently see two specimens\r\nengaged in aerial battle. They fly upwards, and coursing round each other\r\nwith great velocity, almost disappear in the clear blue sky. A few seconds\r\nlater the two insects, gently fanning their wings in the warm sunshine, are\r\nagain seen in their respective places.\r\n\r\n\r\nVANESSA ITEA, Fabr.\r\n\r\n  (_Papilio itea_, Fabr., Syst. Ent., p. 498, n. 238 (1775); Donovan Ins.\r\n  New Holland, pl. 26, fig. 1 (1805). _Vanessa itea_, Godart, Enc.

Diurn. Lepid., p. 202 (1849).)\r\n\r\n(Plate XII., fig. 3, fig. 4 under side.)\r\n\r\nThis beautiful butterfly is, I believe, fairly abundant in the northern\r\nportions of the North Island, but becomes scarcer southwards of Napier and\r\nNew Plymouth. In the {108}South Island I believe I once saw a specimen at\r\nNelson, but beyond that I can find no record of its occurrence there.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 2 inches. The fore-wings are black,\r\n  becoming reddish-brown speckled with gold towards the base; _there is a\r\n  very broad yellow band nearly across the middle, and one yellow and two\r\n  white spots near the apex_. The hind-wings are rich reddish-brown,\r\n  broadly bordered with black, especially towards the costa; there are four\r\n  small black spots with blue centres near the termen, and a blue stripe\r\n  bordered with black at the tornus. The under surface closely resembles\r\n  that of _Vanessa gonerilla_, except that the red patch on the fore-wings\r\n  is replaced by pale yellow, and the markings on the hind-wings are more\r\n  sharply defined.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from January till April, hibernated specimens\r\noccurring in the spring. It is very fond of selecting a perch on the top of\r\na hill, and often engages in violent encounters with _Vanessa gonerilla_.\r\nDuring the contest both insects course round each other with great\r\nrapidity, and generally ascend to a considerable elevation. They almost\r\ninvariably return to their former resting-places. This is a fortunate habit\r\nfor the collector, as it frequently enables him to ultimately capture a\r\nspecimen, which he has almost touched with the net on several previous\r\noccasions. I have noticed this propensity to return to a favourite perch in\r\nthe European species of the genus _Vanessa_, so that it is most likely a\r\ncongenital habit, probably of great antiquity.\r\n\r\nThis insect has a fine appearance when flying; the large yellow spots on\r\nthe forewings are then very conspicuous, and ensure its immediate and\r\ncertain recognition.\r\n\r\n\r\nVANESSA CARDUI, L.\r\n\r\n  (_Vanessa cardui_, L. _Cynthia kershawii_, McCoy, Ann. and Mag. Nat.\r\n  Hist. iv., vol. i. p. 76 (1868). _Pyrameis cardui_, var. _P. kershawii_,\r\n  Butler, Erebus and Terror Lep., p. 29 (1874).)\r\n\r\n(Plate XII., fig. 1, 2 under side.)\r\n\r\nThis elegant butterfly occurs throughout both islands, but is very\r\nirregular in its appearance. In some years it is quite abundant, whilst in\r\nothers scarcely a specimen will be seen. During the summer of 1889-1890 it\r\nwas extremely plentiful in the Wellington district, being at that time much\r\ncommoner than _Vanessa gonerilla_, but its appearance in such large numbers\r\nas this was, I think, very exceptional.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings varies from 2 to 2¼ inches. _Above, all the\r\n  wings are orange-red, spotted and mottled with black._ The fore-wings are\r\n  bronzy towards the base; _in the black apex there are five white spots_.\r\n  Near the termen of the hind-wings three of the black spots have blue\r\n  centres. On the under side of the fore-wings the markings are very\r\n  similar to those on the upper side, except that there are several\r\n  additional white blotches, and the orange-red ground colour has a rosy\r\n  blush towards the base. The hind-wings are very beautifully mottled with\r\n  an elaborate series of pale brown, purplish-grey, yellowish-brown, and\r\n  white markings; three of the large spots near the termen have pale blue\r\n  centres.\r\n\r\nI have not yet met with the larva of this insect, neither can I find any\r\nrecord of its having been observed in New Zealand. The following\r\ndescription by Mr. Stainton is taken from a European specimen:[51] \"The\r\nspiny larva is brown with two dorsal and two lateral yellow lines; on the\r\nthird, fourth, and twelfth segments there are four spines; on the fifth to\r\neleventh segments seven spines, and on the thirteenth two spines; it feeds\r\nsolitarily in rolled thistle-leaves.\"\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in January, February, March and April,\r\nhibernated specimens occurring from August until December. It is a much\r\nmore wary butterfly than either _Vanessa gonerilla_ or _V. itea_, and can\r\nseldom be captured after it has once been {109}disturbed, although it will\r\noften return to the same spot several times in succession. In fact, owing\r\nto its extreme timidity, its capture is generally attended with some\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nThis insect is found almost throughout the entire world. In specimens from\r\nthe Northern Hemisphere the black spots on the hind-wings have no blue\r\ncentres, and the butterflies are a little larger than those found in the\r\nSouthern Hemisphere, otherwise the two insects are exactly alike. The\r\nsouthern form has been called _V. kershawii_ by several writers, but the\r\ndifferences do not appear to me to be sufficiently important to merit a\r\ndistinct specific name, especially as both forms occur together in South\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nThis insect has frequently been observed at various places on the European\r\nContinent migrating in vast swarms; and it seems probable that its strong\r\nmigratory instinct may have led to its enormously wide range at the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 3.--JUNONIA.\r\n\r\n  \"Eyes glabrous. Club of antennæ abrupt. Fore-wings, with vein 10\r\n  separate. Hind-wings with transverse vein, absent between veins 4 and 5.\"\r\n  (Meyrick.)\r\n\r\nWe have one species in New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNONIA VELLEDA.\r\n\r\n(Plate XI., fig. 16, fig. 17 under side.)\r\n\r\nThis butterfly was very common in the neighbourhood of Wellington during\r\nthe summer of 1886-87. To the best of my knowledge the insect had not\r\npreviously been observed in New Zealand, but I understand from Mr. R.\r\nHolloway that he has since met with it on the sea-coast near New Plymouth,\r\nin 1893, and at Motueka in 1898.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is nearly 2 inches. On the upper side all the\r\n  wings are dull blackish-brown, with greenish or bronzy reflections. The\r\n  fore-wings have two broad orange-brown stripes on the costa, and _a very\r\n  large patch of the same colour along the termen, containing a large black\r\n  spot with a bluish-white centre_; there are three irregular whitish marks\r\n  near the apex of the wing, and a minute blue-centred ocellus. The\r\n  hind-wings have _two very large orange-brown spots almost touching each\r\n  other near the termen; each of these contains a large blue-centred\r\n  ocellus in the middle_; there are also two terminal rows of brown\r\n  crescent-shaped markings. Underneath, the markings of the fore-wings\r\n  resemble those of the upper side, but they are very much paler, and the\r\n  ground colour is light brown. The hind-wings are pale brown, with a wavy\r\n  black line across the middle, followed by a brown shading towards the\r\n  termen; there are also four small round black spots and a series of\r\n  irregular black dots near the termen.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect occurred very plentifully in December, January and\r\nFebruary, and was fond of settling on barren, stony places in the hot\r\nsunshine. It was very timid and difficult to catch, darting off with great\r\nrapidity when approached. During the season I managed to secure about nine\r\nspecimens, some of them in very good condition. I am unable to explain the\r\nsudden appearance of this butterfly in New Zealand during the\r\nabove-mentioned year. The large numbers, which were observed over extended\r\nareas, almost seem to forbid its accidental importation from Australia,\r\nwhilst the distance of New Zealand from that continent would render\r\nimmigration a most unlikely circumstance. On the other hand, if the insect\r\nis a regular inhabitant of this country, it is strange that it had never\r\nbefore been observed. When on the wing, its superficial resemblance to\r\n_Vanessa cardui_ may have led to its having been overlooked, and hence it\r\nis very desirable that entomologists should use every effort to detect it\r\nin the future.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Olliff, this butterfly has a very wide geographical range,\r\nbeing {110}found in Java, Sumatra, Tasmania and all parts of the Australian\r\nContinent. About the year 1830 it was described by Stephens, in his\r\n'British Entomology,' under the name of _Cynthia hampstediensis_, on\r\naccount of its having been taken at Hampstead, the well-known suburb of\r\nLondon. Subsequently it transpired that the specimen in question was no\r\ndoubt of foreign origin, its \"appearance\" having been due to a practical\r\njoke perpetrated on the British Lepidopterists of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily 2.--SATYRIDÆ.\r\n\r\n  \"Characters of _Nymphalidæ_, but fore-wings with vein 12 greatly dilated\r\n  towards base.\" (Plate I., figs. 25, 26, and 27, neuration of _Erebia\r\n  pluto_.)\r\n\r\n\"A large group of very general distribution. The species are usually of\r\nmoderate size, generally dark coloured with light bands or spots, and with\r\nseveral round, black, white-centred spots on lower surface.

(See Plate III., figs. 4 and 5 larvæ,\r\n28 and 29 pupæ.)\r\n\r\nOf this family we have three genera represented in New Zealand:--\r\n\r\n1. ARGYROPHENGA.    2. DODONIDIA.    3. EREBIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 1.--ARGYROPHENGA.\r\n\r\n  Eyes glabrous. Club of antennæ somewhat abrupt. Fore-wings with lower\r\n  margin of cell greatly dilated towards base; veins 8, 9, 10, and 11 out\r\n  of 7; vein 12 greatly dilated towards base.\r\n\r\nOf this genus there is one species in New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGYROPHENGA ANTIPODUM, Doubleday.\r\n\r\n  (_Argyrophenga antipodum_, Doubleday, Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist. xvi. p.\r\n  307 (1845); Gen. Diurn. Lepid. pl. 63, fig. 6 (1851); Butler, Erebus and\r\n  Terror Lep., pl. 8, figs. 4, 7 (1874).)\r\n\r\n(Plate XI., fig. 4 [M], 5 [F], 3 variety, 6 under side of [M], 7 under side\r\nof variety; Plate III., fig. 4 larva, fig. 29 pupa.)\r\n\r\nThis species occurs commonly on the tussock lands from Christchurch to\r\nInvercargill. In the provinces of Nelson and Marlborough it is, I believe,\r\nconfined to situations having elevations of from 2,000 to 4,000 feet above\r\nthe sea-level. It has never been captured in the North Island.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings varies from 1-3/8 to 1¾ inches. _Above, all\r\n  the wings are dull brownish-black, paler near the body; the outer portion\r\n  of each is covered with a large patch of bright orange-brown (northern\r\n  form), or fawn colour (southern form); on the fore-wings this patch\r\n  contains a large oval black spot, with two white dots in the middle; on\r\n  the hind-wings there are two, three, or four black spots, with one white\r\n  dot in the centre of each_; beneath, the markings on the fore-wings\r\n  resemble those of the upper surface, except that there are often several\r\n  short silvery stripes near the apex; the hind-wings are dull yellow, with\r\n  silver streaks between the veins, and one broader streak in the centre of\r\n  the wing. The female is much paler than the male, with the borders of the\r\n  wings whitish.\r\n\r\nThis insect is extremely variable. The colouring appears to be much\r\ninfluenced by local conditions. On the Dun Mountain, Nelson district, at an\r\nelevation of about 2,700 feet, a very small light form occurs in which the\r\nsexes are almost exactly alike. There are only two perfect spots on the\r\nupper surface of the hind-wings; the other spot is {111}rudimentary, and\r\nhas no white central dot. On the under side there are no silver stripes\r\nnear the apex of the fore-wings, and only five or six silver stripes on the\r\nmarginal portions of the hind-wings (see Plate XI., figs. 3 and 7). At\r\nKekerangu, on the \"Chalk Range,\" at an elevation of from 3,000 to 4,000\r\nfeet, a similar but slightly larger form occurs. On the Tableland of Mount\r\nArthur, Nelson district, 3,600 to 4,600 feet above the sea-level, the\r\nfemales are paler than in either of the preceding forms, and the males\r\ndarker, so that the sexes are well marked; but there are no silvery stripes\r\non the under side of the apex of the fore-wings, and usually only five\r\nstripes on the marginal portions of the hind-wings. Finally, in the\r\nCanterbury, Otago and Southland butterflies (southern form), we have the\r\nlarge, very dark reddish-brown coloured male insect with large ocelli, and\r\nthe extremely pale yellow female with small ocelli, the two sexes here\r\nexhibiting the greatest differentiation. On the under side, the male has\r\nseveral small silver stripes near the apex of the fore-wings, and seven\r\nstripes on the marginal portions of the hind-wings. (See Plate XI., figs.\r\n4, 5, and 6.) In elevated situations in Canterbury, however, I have taken a\r\nsomewhat similar variety to that found on the Mount Arthur Tableland. I\r\nhave also taken similar forms on Mount Robert near Lake Rotoiti, Nelson\r\ndistrict, these having, in addition, numerous white hairs on the wings near\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nBesides these extreme variations, which appear to be largely dependent on\r\nlocal conditions, great variability exists with respect to the number and\r\nsize of the ocelli or white-centred spots. In some specimens there are no\r\nocelli on the hind-wings; in others, two, three, or four very minute ones,\r\nwhilst others have all four very large. Occasionally specimens have a\r\nminute ocellus below the large one on the fore-wings. Were it not for the\r\nintermediate varieties, there would probably be little hesitation in\r\nseparating the extreme forms of this insect into several distinct species;\r\nbut as they are connected by a host of intermediate forms, it is quite\r\nimpossible even to divide them into varieties.\r\n\r\nIn a paper communicated to the 'Entomologist' in February, 1889,[52] by Mr.\r\nW. W. Smith, the author makes some interesting remarks on the variation of\r\nthis butterfly, as observed by him in Canterbury and Otago. After pointing\r\nout the great diversity exhibited by different specimens in the depth of\r\ncolouring, and in the number and size of the ocelli, he states that in his\r\nopinion the greatest variation occurs during the summers that succeed wet\r\nwinters. In the year 1888 I had the opportunity of inspecting a most\r\ninteresting series of this insect, presented by Mr. Smith to the Wellington\r\nMuseum. They embraced specimens of very varied colouring, and included,\r\namongst other remarkable forms, a male, which was entirely destitute of all\r\nocelli, both on the fore- and on the hind-wings. Amongst these specimens,\r\nhowever, I did not see any resembling those I have described from Nelson\r\nand Marlborough. This collection has, I regret to say, since been disposed\r\nof by the Museum authorities, and cannot therefore be utilised by New\r\nZealand students.\r\n\r\nThe larva of this insect feeds on the tussock grass (_Poa australis_). Its\r\nlength, when full grown, is about 1 inch. The top of the head is furnished\r\nwith a very large process, which projects forwards. The body is much\r\nattenuated towards the tail, which is bifid. The general colour is dull\r\ngreen, with a crimson line on each side and numerous alternate lines of\r\nyellow and white. The legs and prolegs are very small. There are four\r\nwrinkles on the posterior edges of each segment.\r\n\r\n{112}When feeding, this caterpillar rests on a blade of the tussock, where\r\nit is very inconspicuous. It appears to prefer the dead or drier portions\r\nof the grass, and feeds and grows very slowly. It is strictly diurnal in\r\nits habits, relapsing into a death-like repose at night.\r\n\r\nThe pupa is suspended by the tail to an upright blade of the tussock. In\r\nthe specimen I reared, I was fortunate enough to witness the actual\r\ntransformation, and during the process, observed it seizing hold of the\r\nlarval skin with its posterior segments, its manoeuvres whilst thus engaged\r\nexactly resembling those of the pupa of _Anosia erippus_, described above\r\nby Professor Riley.\r\n\r\nThe length of the pupa is about ½ inch. Its colour is bright green, with a\r\nreddish line along the edge of each wing-case, and several white lines on\r\nthe sides and back.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from December till the end of March. It is\r\nusually very abundant where found, the males being more numerous than the\r\nfemales in the proportion of about five to one. It flies amongst the\r\ntussock grass in a weak and aimless manner. When rapidly pursued it has a\r\nhabit of plunging into a tussock and closing its wings, where it remains\r\nquite invisible until the danger is past.\r\n\r\nThe silver stripes on the under side of the hind-wings are very protective\r\nto the insect when at rest on its food-plant, the striped coloration of the\r\nlarva and pupa no doubt serving similar protective purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 2.--DODONIDIA, Butl.\r\n\r\n  Characters as in _Argyrophenga_, except that vein 11 of the fore-wings\r\n  rises from upper margin of cell, shortly before transverse vein.\r\n\r\nWe have one species in New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\nDODONIDIA HELMSI, Fereday.\r\n\r\n(_Dodonidia helmsi_, Fereday, Trans. N. Z. Inst. xv. 193.)\r\n\r\n(Plate XI., fig. 14, fig. 15 under side; Plate III., fig. 5 larva, fig. 28\r\npupa.)\r\n\r\nA single specimen of this interesting butterfly was discovered by Mr. R.\r\nHelms, in 1881, on the Paparoa Range, near Greymouth, at an elevation of\r\nabout 1,500 feet above the sea-level. Until within the last three years\r\nonly three other specimens had been captured, viz., one near Wainui-o-mata,\r\nin Mr. A. P. Buller's collection; one on the Dun Mountain, Nelson, at an\r\nelevation of about 2,500 feet, which is in my collection; and one on the\r\nTableland of Mount Arthur, at about 3,300 feet, which was kindly given to\r\nme by Mr. C. W. Palmer. In the summer of 1894-95 several specimens were\r\ncaptured by Mr. P. Marshall near Wanganui,[53] and during the same season\r\nMessrs. Smithers and Hawthorne discovered the insect in considerable\r\nabundance at a locality near Silverstream, in the Wellington district.\r\nDuring the two following summers additional specimens were obtained near\r\nSilverstream, and I was fortunate enough to discover there a number of\r\nspecimens of the larva, which furnished the material for the illustration\r\nand description of the preparatory stages of the insect given in this work.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 2 inches. _On the upper side all the\r\n  wings are dark brown. The fore-wings have two broad bands of\r\n  yellowish-orange, the outer one containing a {113}small patch of dark\r\n  brown near the costa, which touches a white-centred black ocellus. The\r\n  hind-wings have one large patch of yellowish-orange containing two\r\n  ocelli; a large ocellus, surrounded by a broad ring of reddish-orange, is\r\n  situated on the tornus_; the tornus is produced into two very broad but\r\n  short tails, which are bordered with white cilia. On the under side the\r\n  fore-wings are light ochreous-yellow; there is a shaded brown patch at\r\n  the base; the termen is broadly bordered with brown, the border\r\n  containing a silver streak; two broad brown patches are situated on the\r\n  costa, the outer one terminated by a small ocellus, and enclosing a\r\n  silvery patch near the apex of the wing. _The hind-wings are silvery,\r\n  narrowly bordered with deep reddish-brown, with five deep reddish-brown\r\n  stripes running from the costa towards the tornus_; the fourth stripe\r\n  from the base of the wing contains three ocelli surrounded by yellow\r\n  rings; a conspicuous ocellus is situated at the tornus, surrounded by a\r\n  broad orange-red ring.\r\n\r\nThis insect appears to vary a little in the extent of the yellowish-orange\r\ncolouring of the upper side. It also varies in size, specimens from the\r\nNorth Island being slightly larger than those from the South Island.\r\n\r\nThe larva feeds on a species of sedge (_Galinia setifolia_), which always\r\ngrows abundantly in the birch forests, where the butterflies are found.\r\nWhen full grown the length of this caterpillar is about 1¼ inches. Its body\r\nis much attenuated at each end and rather stout in the middle; the head and\r\ntail are bifid; there are numerous straight, shallow, transverse wrinkles\r\non each segment, especially towards the head. The colour is green, with a\r\nnumber of fine, paler and darker green, dorsal and lateral lines; the head\r\nand thirteenth segment are yellowish. The legs are very minute, and the\r\nprolegs of moderate size. It is extremely susceptible to the attacks of a\r\nDipterous parasite. In fact, out of thirty larvæ kept by Mr. Hawthorne and\r\nmyself, no less than 75 per cent. were thus destroyed. This larva feeds on\r\nthe leaves of the sedge, eating out long notches parallel to the veins of\r\nthe leaf. These notches are the best guides to follow in searching for the\r\nlarva, as the colouring of the caterpillar renders its discovery amongst\r\nthe food-plant extremely difficult. The larvæ should be looked for during\r\nthe end of December or the beginning of January.\r\n\r\nThe pupa is rather stout, light green, with the edge of the wing-case and\r\nthe prominences formed by the back and palpi, edged with crimson and white.\r\nIt is suspended by the tail to any firm object in the neighbourhood of the\r\nsedge.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in February. It frequents sunny glades in the\r\nbirch forest, usually at considerable elevations above the sea-level. Mr.\r\nHelms informs me that he has seen specimens near Greymouth in October, and\r\nhence concludes that there are two broods in the year. The butterfly is\r\nvery difficult to capture, as it has a most provoking habit of resting on\r\nthe foliage of the birch-trees, just out of the collector's reach. I am\r\nunable to explain the object of the remarkable colouring of the under side\r\nof this insect, but it is probably protective, although in what way has yet\r\nto be discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 3.--EREBIA, Dalm.\r\n\r\n  \"Eyes glabrous. Club of antennæ abrupt.\" (Plate I., figs. 25, 26, and 27\r\n  neuration of _Erebia pluto_.)\r\n\r\n\"An extensive and essentially Alpine genus inhabiting the mountains of\r\nEurope, Asia, North America, and South Africa.

Mo. Mag. xii.\r\n  10 (1874). _Oreina othello_, Fereday, Trans. N. Z. Inst. viii. 302, 304,\r\n  pl. ix. (1876). _Percnodaimon pluto_, Butl., Ent. Mo. Mag. xii. 153\r\n  (1876); Catalogue of N. Z. Butterflies, 10.)\r\n\r\n(Plate XI., fig. 8 [M], 9 [F], 10 under side.)\r\n\r\nThis fine butterfly has occurred plentifully on many mountain-tops in the\r\nSouth Island, from Nelson to Lake Wakatipu. It has never been observed in\r\nthe North Island.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings of the male is 1¾ inches, of the female 2\r\n  inches. _On the upper side all the wings are a very rich bronzy-black.\r\n  The fore-wings have a paler patch near the apex, containing two small,\r\n  and three large black ocelli with white centres_; these ocelli are\r\n  usually joined together. On the under side all the wings are considerably\r\n  paler and greyer. The hind-wings have a series of pale spots near the\r\n  termen, and a paler shade across the middle.\r\n\r\nThe insect varies chiefly in the number of ocelli. On the upper side of the\r\nfore-wings there are sometimes only four, the minute ocellus on the costa\r\nbeing absent, whilst occasionally a small extra ocellus appears below the\r\nnormal series. On the under side this last-mentioned ocellus is very\r\nfrequently, but not invariably, present. In some female specimens an\r\nextremely minute ocellus may be detected on the upper surface of the\r\nhind-wings near the termen. On the under side of the hind-wings in both\r\nsexes the series of pale terminal spots are often absent, and the general\r\ndepth of the colouring varies considerably.\r\n\r\nMr. Fereday has described and figured a very interesting variation\r\noccurring in the structure of the costal veins of this species,[54] vein 11\r\nof the fore-wings sometimes running into 12 (see Plate I., fig. 26), and\r\nsometimes being entirely absent (fig. 25). After reading Mr. Fereday's\r\narticle I examined the specimens in my own collection, and found that all\r\nthose taken on Mount Arthur and on Mount Peel, in the Nelson district, had\r\nveins 11 and 12 joined, whilst the two specimens I took on Mount Enys,\r\nCastle Hill, West Coast Road, had vein 11 absent. As, however, Mr. Fereday\r\nhas specimens exhibiting both forms of neuration, from Castle Hill and from\r\nMount Hutt, I do not think it likely that the peculiarity is confined to\r\nbutterflies from any particular locality. Like Mr. Fereday, I have observed\r\nthat the specimens having veins 11 and 12 joined, are smaller than those\r\nhaving vein 11 absent.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in January, February and March. It frequents\r\nshingle slopes on mountains, at elevations ranging from 4,000 to 6,000 feet\r\nabove the sea-level. Sometimes the butterflies occur in considerable\r\nnumbers, flying in a lazy, aimless manner in the scorching sunshine, but\r\ninstantly retreating into crevices between the stones when the sun is\r\nobscured. I have observed that this species is most abundant in the\r\nneighbourhood of the carpet grass, on which I fully anticipate its larva\r\nfeeds. It seldom, however, settles on this grass, preferring to alight on\r\nthe shingle, which, owing to the rarefied air existing at such high\r\nelevations, soon becomes intensely heated by the sun's rays.\r\n\r\nWhen disturbed this insect flies with considerable rapidity and thus often\r\neludes the net, so that the capture of a good series of specimens on a\r\nrugged mountain-top is usually very exciting, if not actually dangerous\r\nwork. As with many other {115}insects, mountain ranges are more prolific in\r\nthis butterfly than isolated peaks. Mount Peel, situated to the west of\r\nMount Arthur, is the best locality I know of for this and many other Alpine\r\nspecies. Its gentle slopes enable the collector to work with perfect ease\r\nand safety, whilst the patches of rich soil occurring nearly to the top of\r\nthe mountain support an unusually varied Alpine flora of great interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nEREBIA BUTLERI, Fereday.\r\n\r\n(_Erebiola butleri_, Fereday, Trans. N. Z. Inst. xii. 264; Catalogue of N.\r\nZ. Butterflies, 19.)\r\n\r\n(Plate XI., fig. 11 [M], 12 [F], 13 under side.)\r\n\r\nThis interesting butterfly was described from three dilapidated specimens\r\ncaptured by Mr. J. D. Enys at Whitcombe's Pass, Canterbury, on March 8,\r\n1879, at about 4,000 feet above the sea-level. From that time I believe no\r\nother specimens had been found until January, 1894, when I took quite a\r\nlarge number on the Humboldt Range, at the head of Lake Wakatipu, at\r\nelevations ranging from 4,000 to 5,000 feet above the sea-level.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings of the male is 1-5/8 inches, of the female 1½\r\n  inches. _On the upper side all the wings of the male are smoky-brown; the\r\n  fore-wings have a large black ocellus near the apex, enclosing two white\r\n  dots, followed by a smaller ocellus towards the dorsum; the hind-wings\r\n  have three black spots near the termen, sometimes enclosing white dots._\r\n  Occasionally these ocelli are surrounded by a patch of deep\r\n  reddish-brown. The female is much paler, with large patches of\r\n  yellowish-brown surrounding the ocelli. On the under side the fore-wings\r\n  of the male are smoky-brown, with an irregular blotch of reddish-brown\r\n  near the apex, surrounding a small white-centred black ocellus. _The\r\n  hind-wings are dark reddish-brown, with several conspicuous black-edged\r\n  silvery markings, and four yellowish-red spots near the termen._ The\r\n  under side of the female is very much paler.\r\n\r\nThis butterfly varies considerably on the upper side in the number and size\r\nof the ocelli, and in the extent of the reddish-brown markings which\r\nsurround them; on the under side the silvery spots on the hind-wings are\r\nalso variable.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect has been taken in January and March. It evidently\r\nfrequents mountains in the South Island, at elevations of about 4,000 feet,\r\nbut does not appear to be generally distributed in such localities. It\r\nseldom settles on the shingle, mostly resting on the snow grass, on which\r\nits larva probably feeds. It is a smaller insect than _E. pluto_, and flies\r\nmuch more feebly. These characteristics will at once enable the collector\r\nto distinguish it from _E. pluto_ when on the wing.\r\n\r\nImmediately a cloud obscures the sun these butterflies retreat into the\r\ntufts of the snow grass, remaining closely hidden there until the sun\r\nshines out again. This circumstance makes the capture of the insect, even\r\nin a favourable locality, a matter of considerable uncertainty, as bright\r\nsunshine is more often the exception than the rule on the summits of high\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily 3.--LYCÆNIDÆ.\r\n\r\n  \"Anterior legs developed, but tarsi of [M] more or less abbreviated, or\r\n  with one or both claws absent; posterior tibiæ without middle spurs.\r\n  Fore-wings with vein 7 absent, 8 and 9 stalked or coincident.

Z., Trans. N.\r\n  Z. Inst. x. 263. _Chrysophanus rauparaha_, Fereday, Trans. N. Z. Inst.\r\n  ix. 460. _Chrysophanus maui_, ib. x. 252.)\r\n\r\n(Plate XII., fig. 18 [M], 19 [F], 20 and 21 under side;  Plate XIII., figs.\r\n2, 3, 4, and 5 varieties.)\r\n\r\nThis pretty little butterfly appears to be very common in most parts of New\r\nZealand. I have records of its occurrence in abundance at various\r\nlocalities, from Napier southwards to Invercargill.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings varies from 1 to 1½ inches. _On the upper side\r\n  all the wings are brilliant shining copper, with black markings._\r\n  Fore-wings with three spots near the middle, then a row of black spots,\r\n  often forming a band nearly parallel with the termen, another row on the\r\n  termen, generally touching the narrow black border of the wing.\r\n  Hind-wings resembling fore-wings, except that there is only one elongate\r\n  spot in the centre, and the terminal series of spots is nearly always\r\n  separated from the black border. In the female the black spots are united\r\n  and form bands, those on the termen often having violet or blue centres.\r\n  The veins in both sexes are indicated by black lines, which are often\r\n  double in the male, when the vein itself is coppery. On the under side\r\n  the fore-wings are orange-brown, bordered with yellow; the spots resemble\r\n  those of the upper side, except that the terminal series are generally\r\n  faint or obsolete towards the costa. The hind-wings vary from light\r\n  yellow to dull brown; the spots are dull greyish, the posterior series\r\n  often having white centres.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it may be seen that the variation in this insect is\r\nconsiderable. After a careful examination of a large number of specimens\r\ntaken at various localities in both North and South Islands, I am, however,\r\nunable to find characters of sufficient constancy to entitle any of the\r\nforms to specific rank. The most striking of these varieties appears to be\r\nthat described by Mr. Bates as _Chrysophanus feredayi_.[55] (See Plate\r\nXIII., fig. 2, upper side; Plate XII., fig. 21, under side.) On the upper\r\nsurface it has the central series of spots almost forming a band in the\r\nmale, and the coppery ground colour is paler than in the typical form. On\r\nthe under side the borders of the fore-wings, and the whole of the\r\nhind-wings are dull brown. This form closely resembles _C. rauparaha_,\r\nFereday.[56] _C. maui_, Fereday, is evidently that variety of the male\r\nhaving the veins bordered with two fine black lines. Mr. Fereday states\r\nthat he has never been able to find the female of his _C. maui_. This is\r\nreadily accounted for by the fact, that the female of _C. maui_ is nothing\r\nmore than the female of _C. salustius_.\r\n\r\nRecently two very remarkable aberrations of _C. salustius_ have come under\r\nmy {117}notice; one captured by Mr. Hawthorne at Karori, in which the\r\nhind-wings are almost entirely suffused with blackish-brown, excepting a\r\nsmall patch of copper colour near the centre, and two patches on the\r\ntermen. Another specimen, taken by Mr. Grapes near Paraparaumu, has the\r\nfore-wings also suffused with blackish-brown, except near the middle, where\r\nthere are five coppery patches between the veins. On the under side there\r\nare six large oblong spots near the termen of the fore-wings, and a series\r\nof dusky oblong spots on the hind-wings. (See Plate XIII., fig. 3, fig. 4\r\nunder side.) Plate XIII., fig. 5, represents another variety discovered by\r\nMr. Grapes on the coast near Paikakariki, in the Wellington district. It is\r\nremarkable for the bright blue terminal spots which are present in both\r\nsexes.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of _C. salustius_, when first deposited, are pale green with\r\nyellow reticulations, the whole egg having a honeycombed appearance when\r\nmagnified. They become uniform pale yellow before hatching. The young larva\r\nis shaped somewhat like a wood-louse. The head is quite hidden by the three\r\nanterior segments, which are much larger than the rest. After the first\r\nmoult the larva becomes bright green, with a crimson line down the back;\r\nthe head is then larger, and the three anterior segments considerably\r\nreduced. Unfortunately the life-history could not be investigated beyond\r\nthis point, as the larvæ all died. The time of year when this occurred was\r\nlate autumn, and it therefore seems probable that the larvæ hibernate and\r\nundergo their transformation early the following spring.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect first appears in November and continues abundant until\r\nthe middle or end of February. Specimens of what I believe to be a second\r\nbrood may be taken in March and April if the weather be fine, but in stormy\r\nseasons these are frequently not observed. I have also noticed that the\r\nautumnal specimens are usually smaller and paler in colour than those\r\ncaptured in the spring.\r\n\r\nThis butterfly frequents open situations, and in fine, sunny weather it is\r\noften very common.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRYSOPHANUS ENYSII, Butl.\r\n\r\n(_Chrysophanus enysii_, Butler, Ent. Mo. Mag. xiii. 153 (1876).)\r\n\r\n(Plate XII., fig. 22 [M], 23 [F], 24 under side.)\r\n\r\nThis species is tolerably common in the Wellington district, and I expect\r\nit will be found to occur in most localities in the North Island. I have\r\nalso taken the insect at Nelson, but have not heard of its capture\r\nelsewhere in the South Island.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings varies from 1 to 1¼ inches. On the upper\r\n  surface both sexes resemble some of the females of _Chrysophanus\r\n  salustius_, except that the dark markings are very much broader, and the\r\n  coppery colour is paler and less lustrous. On the under side the\r\n  fore-wings are pale yellowish-brown, bordered with darker brown, with\r\n  three black spots near the middle, and a chain of black spots beyond the\r\n  middle. _The hind-wings are yellow, with a very large irregular patch of\r\n  purplish brown extending over the costal and terminal portions._\r\n\r\nThis insect varies chiefly in the extent of the dark markings on the upper\r\nside, which sometimes very much encroach on the golden ground colour. The\r\nspaces between veins 2, 3, and 4, near their origin are sometimes yellow\r\nand sometimes black, but, as every intermediate form exists, cannot be\r\ndistinguished as species. Mr. Fereday regards the form with the black\r\nspaces as _C. feredayi_, Bates. As previously stated, however, I am\r\ninclined to think that _C. feredayi_, Bates, is the same form as _C.\r\nrauparaha_, Fereday.\r\n\r\n{118}This butterfly is essentially a forest-loving species, and may\r\nsometimes be taken quite plentifully in sunny openings on fine days, during\r\nDecember and January. It is not nearly so common as _C. salustius_, and I\r\ndo not think that there is more than a single brood in a season.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRYSOPHANUS BOLDENARUM, White.\r\n\r\n  (_Lycæna boldenarum_, White, Proc. Ent. Soc., Ser. 3, 1, p. 26 (1862).\r\n  _Chrysophanus boldenarum_, Butl., Zool. Erebus and Terror, Ins. Lep., p.\r\n  29, n. 8, pl. 8, figs. 8, 9 (1874).)\r\n\r\n(Plate XII., figs. 13, 14, [M] varieties, 15 under side of [M], 16 [F], 17\r\nunder side of [F].)\r\n\r\nThis brilliant little butterfly is very common in most localities in the\r\nSouth Island. In the North Island it has occurred at Lakes Wairarapa and\r\nTaupo.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 7/8 inch. On the upper side the male has\r\n  all the wings brown, _tinged with the most brilliant glistening purple_.\r\n  The fore-wings have two or three black spots near the middle, a curved\r\n  series beyond the middle, and on the termen. The hind-wings have two\r\n  black spots near the middle, a series beyond the middle, and a terminal\r\n  series, generally with blue centres. All the wings are narrowly bordered\r\n  with black. The female is pale yellowish-brown, the spots resemble those\r\n  of the male, except that all the marginal series have bright purple or\r\n  blue centres. On the under side the fore-wings of both sexes are pale\r\n  yellow, bordered with slaty-blue: the spots are the same as on the upper\r\n  side. The hind-wings are brownish-grey in male, slaty-grey in female,\r\n  with the basal portion darker, and the spots of the upper side always\r\n  indicated.\r\n\r\nThis insect is extremely variable, but I do not think it likely that any of\r\nthe numerous forms will prove sufficiently constant to be regarded as\r\ndistinct species. The male varies in the size and number of the black\r\nspots, many of which are often absent; in the extent of the purple sheen\r\nwhich is sometimes absent from the hind-wings, sometimes partially absent\r\nfrom the fore-wings, and sometimes extends over the whole of both pairs of\r\nwings; also in the colour of such sheen, which often inclines towards blue.\r\nSome specimens are much paler than others, and so far as my experience\r\ngoes, these are chiefly found at considerable elevations; in such\r\nspecimens, the ground colouring inclines towards yellow or orange, and the\r\npurple sheen is very brilliant, and extends over the whole of the wings.\r\nThe female of this form is proportionately paler. Other specimens have the\r\nhind-wings almost black with no purple sheen, whilst in others the purple\r\nsheen remains. Another form has the usual markings, but the hind-wings are\r\ndeep orange-brown, without purple sheen, which is also absent from the\r\nouter portions of the fore-wings. One female in my collection is dull\r\nbrown, with yellow markings between the two rows of black spots. The under\r\nside is still more variable. One very striking form has only the basal\r\nportions of the fore-wings yellow, the rest of the ground colour is pale\r\nbluish-grey, and the spots black. On the hind-wings there are a number of\r\nblack spots near the base; then an irregular band of black, and then a\r\ndouble row of marginal spots. An almost unlimited number of varieties\r\nappears to connect this form with one, in which all the markings on the\r\nhind-wings are nearly obsolete. The specimens of this insect taken in each\r\ndistrict appear to exhibit differences from those taken elsewhere, but\r\nspecimens also differ from the same district, so that at present we are\r\nunable to detect any well-marked local variation, or topomorphism, as it\r\nhas been termed. It is consequently highly desirable that collectors should\r\nendeavour to obtain specimens from as many localities as possible, so that\r\nthe nature of the variation of this butterfly may be better understood.\r\n\r\nMr. Fereday states[57] that after carefully examining a patch of _Donatia\r\n{119}novæzealandiæ_, a plant he had noticed much frequented by this\r\nbutterfly, he succeeded in finding a larva which there could be little\r\ndoubt would have given rise to this insect, had it lived. The following is\r\ntaken from his description: The caterpillar is shaped like a wood-louse,\r\nhairy, and pale green. There is a series of conical purplish spots down the\r\nback, edged first with white, and then with dull red. On the sides there is\r\na series of pale pinkish oblique stripes, blended with dull red towards the\r\nspiracles.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect is very common in dry, stony places, generally near\r\nriver-beds, during January, February and March. It flies only a short\r\ndistance when disturbed, but is very quick on the wing, and hence difficult\r\nto catch until one becomes accustomed to it. In some places these little\r\nbutterflies are so abundant that they take wing like a swarm of blow-flies.\r\nThey seldom open their wings whilst at rest, so that when perched on the\r\nground they are very inconspicuous.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 2.--LYCÆNA, F.\r\n\r\n  \"Eyes hairy. Club of antennæ elongate. Fore-wings with vein 6 separate, 8\r\n  and 9 stalked.\r\n\r\n\"A large genus of nearly universal distribution. Imago usually with a horny\r\napical hook on anterior tibiæ.

Mo. Mag., 1873, 107.)\r\n\r\n(Plate XII., fig. 10, 11 under side.)\r\n\r\nThis little butterfly is extremely abundant in the neighbourhood of Nelson.\r\nI have also taken it in plenty in several localities in the Wellington\r\ndistrict, and suspect it is common throughout the North Island. In other\r\nparts of the South Island its place appears to be taken by _L. oxleyi_.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings of the male is 1 inch, of the female 7/8 inch.\r\n  On the upper side all the wings are pale blue, broadly bordered with dull\r\n  brown. The cilia are white, faintly barred with brownish. _On the under\r\n  side all the wings, are pale slaty-grey._ There is a faint blackish spot,\r\n  edged with white, near the middle of the fore-wings, and two rows of\r\n  similar spots near the termen. The hind-wings have several very faint\r\n  white-edged spots near the base, a row near the middle, and another row\r\n  almost entirely white near the termen.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect frequents waste grounds and sandhills, generally beside\r\nroads and river-beds, and when found is usually very common. It is on the\r\nwing from the beginning of October until the end of March.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYCÆNA OXLEYI, Feld.\r\n\r\n(_Lycæna oxleyi_, Felder, Reise de Novara Lep. ii., 280, pl. 35, fig. 6,\r\n1865.)\r\n\r\n(Plate XII., fig. 12 under side.)\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Enys[58] this butterfly is common in both islands. I have\r\ntaken specimens in the Canterbury and Nelson districts.\r\n\r\n  On the upper side this species can only be distinguished from the\r\n  preceding by its somewhat brighter colour, and by the cilia which are\r\n  more sharply barred with brown. _On the under side the whole of the\r\n  fore-wings, and the central portions of the hind-wings between the outer\r\n  and inner series of spots, are much darker and browner than in L.\r\n  phoebe_; the spots themselves are also considerably darker, and the\r\n  central series of the hind-wings is almost black. A careful examination,\r\n  however, shows that the markings are practically identical in both\r\n  species, although of different degrees of {120}intensity. In view of the\r\n  great variability, which many species of this genus are known to exhibit\r\n  in other countries, I am inclined to think that this butterfly's claim to\r\n  specific distinction is a very slender one.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect may be taken in similar situations to _Lycæna phoebe_.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPUTED NEW ZEALAND BUTTERFLIES.\r\n\r\nThe following species are recorded by various observers as having occurred\r\nin New Zealand. In nearly every case they are only represented by single\r\nspecimens. They cannot, in my opinion, be regarded as properly belonging to\r\nthe fauna:--\r\n\r\n\r\n1. HAMADRYAS ZOILUS,[59] Fabr.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 1 inch. On the upper side all the wings are\r\n  black, becoming brown towards the base; the fore-wings have three dull\r\n  white spots near the apex; the hind-wings have the whole of the central\r\n  portions white.\r\n\r\nStated by Dieffenbach to occur in New Zealand, probably in error, as it has\r\nnot since been observed. An Australian species. Mr. W. W. Smith, however,\r\ninforms me, that his eldest son recently saw near Ashburton a specimen of\r\nwhat he believed to be this butterfly; but as he was unable to capture it\r\nhe cannot speak with any degree of certainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. EUPLOÆ ---- sp?\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is 2¾ inches. On the upper side all the wings\r\n  are dull, brownish-black, with a series of large white terminal spots.\r\n\r\nTwo or three specimens of this insect are stated by Mr. T. W. Kirk to have\r\nbeen taken near Flat Point on the east coast of the North Island, but no\r\nfurther details are forthcoming. The late Mr. Olliff, to whom I forwarded a\r\nsketch of the insect, informed me that it was not represented in the Sydney\r\ncollections of Australian and South Sea Island butterflies, but he thought\r\nit might be a Malayan species of _Euploæ_.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. VANESSA ATALANTA,[60] L.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is from 2½ to 2¾ inches. \"The fore-wings are\r\n  black, with a broad deep red central band, and with one large and five\r\n  small white spots near the apex. The hind-wings are black, with a broad\r\n  deep red band at the termen, in which are four black spots; at the tornus\r\n  is a large blue-and-black spot.\"[61]\r\n\r\nMr. T. W. Kirk states[62] that he captured a specimen of this familiar\r\nEnglish butterfly in the Wellington Botanical Gardens, in the summer of\r\n1881. On a subsequent occasion he saw several others. No specimens have\r\nsince been detected.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. VANESSA URTICÆ, L.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is from 2 to 2¼ inches. \"The fore-wings are\r\n  reddish-orange with three large black spots on the costa (the third\r\n  followed by a white spot), two smaller black spots near the centre, and\r\n  one large one on the dorsum; a dark border, containing cresentic blue\r\n  spots, runs along the termen. The hind-wings are black at the base, then\r\n  reddish-orange, with a blue-spotted dark border along the termen.\"[63]\r\n\r\nMr. Kirk states[64] that he also obtained specimens of this very common\r\nEnglish butterfly during the same season and in the same locality as\r\n_Vanessa atalanta_. None have been seen by other observers.\r\n\r\n\r\n{121}5. CATOPSILIA CATILLA,[65] Cramer.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of  the wings is nearly 3 inches. On the upper side all the\r\n  wings of the male are pale sulphur-yellow, with a minute brown mark at\r\n  the apex. The female is paler, with a brown spot in the centre of the\r\n  fore-wings, and a chain of brown spots on the termen towards the apex.\r\n\r\nA single male specimen of this butterfly was captured in the grounds of St.\r\nJohn's College, Auckland, and is now in the Auckland Museum. The species is\r\nvery common in Australia, and as this is the only specimen observed it was\r\nno doubt accidentally introduced from that country on board a steamer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{122}V.--THE PYRALIDINA.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot dealt with in this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--THE PSYCHINA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Psychina_ are distinguished by the following characters:--\r\n\r\n  \"Eyes glabrous. Maxillary palpi rudimentary or obsolete (yet sometimes\r\n  well marked in pupa). Posterior tibiæ, with spurs very short, middle\r\n  spurs often absent. Fore-wings with vein 1_b_ furcate, 1_c_ usually\r\n  developed, 5 more or less approximated to 4. Hind-wings with frenulum,\r\n  retinaculum often very broad, 1_c_ present, 8 connected or anastomosing\r\n  with cell.\" (See Plate I., figs. 30, 31 neuration of _Oeceticus\r\n  omnivorus_.)\r\n\r\n\"This ancient group, which furnishes the origin of the five preceding, is\r\nnot now very prominent, though much more numerous in warm regions.\r\n\r\n\"Imago with fore-wings more or less elongate-triangular, hind-wings ovate,\r\noften rather small.\r\n\r\n\"Larva with 10 prolegs, usually with few hairs.\r\n\r\n\"Pupa with segments 8-11 free, usually 7 also (except in _Psychidæ_), in\r\nmale 12 also; protruded from cocoon in emergence.\"--(Meyrick.)\r\n\r\nThe _Psychina_ and _Micropterygina_ are included amongst the _Micros_ by\r\nmost modern authors. I have, however, described and figured certain\r\nconspicuous and interesting species belonging to both these groups. The\r\ninsects in question have, until so very recently, been regarded as\r\n_Macros_, that I think it would be a mistake to omit them in the present\r\nvolume. There can, however, be no question that the modern view is the\r\ncorrect one, and that notwithstanding the large size of some of the\r\nspecies, they are really closely allied to those _Micro-Lepidoptera_, with\r\nwhich they are now associated.\r\n\r\nOf the _Psychina_ we have one family represented in New Zealand--the\r\n_Psychidæ_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily 1.--PSYCHIDÆ.\r\n\r\n  \"Head densely rough-haired.

I have corrected\r\nit.\"--(Meyrick.)\r\n\r\nAlthough I have made several examinations of fully denuded wings of _OE.\r\nomnivorus_, I have been unable to discover any trace of the additional\r\nveins mentioned by Mr. Meyrick. The hair-like scales which clothe the wings\r\nof this insect are very long and slender, and might easily be mistaken for\r\na short vein, if placed in the requisite position. I am disposed to think\r\nthat the examination of undenuded specimens has led to the discrepancy\r\nbetween the results.\r\n\r\nWe have one species.\r\n\r\n\r\nOECETICUS OMNIVORUS, Fereday.\r\n\r\n(_Liothula omnivora_, Fereday, Trans. N. Z. Inst. x., 260, pl. ix.\r\n_Oeceticus omnivorus_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xxii. 212.)\r\n\r\n(Plate XIII., fig. 6 [M]; Plate III., fig. 26, larva in its case; fig. 25\r\nditto withdrawn from case.)\r\n\r\nThis interesting species is seldom seen as an imago in the natural state,\r\nalthough the cases constructed by its larva are of common occurrence.\r\nSpecimens of these cases have been noticed at several localities between\r\nPalmerston, in the North Island, and Invercargill, in the South Island, so\r\nthat apparently the insect is common, and generally distributed throughout\r\nNew Zealand.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings of the male is from 1¼ to 1½ inches. _The\r\n  fore-wings are very elongate and narrow. All the wings are\r\n  blackish-brown, and sparsely covered with scales_, the hind pair being\r\n  semi-transparent. The body is very hairy, and deep black. The antennæ are\r\n  broadly bi-pectinate at the base, becoming almost filiform towards the\r\n  apex. The female insect is apterous, having a close superficial\r\n  resemblance to a large maggot. The head and thorax are very small, and\r\n  the legs and antennæ rudimentary. The extremity of the body is furnished\r\n  with a two-jointed ovipositor, and there are a few scattered yellowish\r\n  scales on various parts of the insect. Its length is about 1 inch.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this species are deposited inside the old case, which the\r\nfemale insect never leaves during the whole of her life. The young larva\r\nwhen first hatched is about 1/8 inch in length. Its head and three anterior\r\nsegments are corneous and much larger than the others, which are rather\r\nsoft with the exception of the last one. These little {124}larvæ are\r\nextremely active, and immediately after hatching leave the old case, and\r\nroam in all directions over the tree, letting themselves down from branch\r\nto branch by silken threads. They carry the posterior portion of their body\r\nelevated in the air, walking whilst doing so by means of their strong\r\nthoracic legs.\r\n\r\nThe food-plants of this species are numerous. The following are a few of\r\nthem: Manuka (_Leptospermum scoparium_ and _ericoides_, _Cupressus\r\nmacrocarpa_, _Pinus insignis_), and various species of willow, &c. These,\r\nit will be observed, include several introduced trees. In fact, the insect\r\nis a very general feeder. About three days after leaving the egg, the\r\nlittle caterpillar constructs a minute, conical-shaped, silken case, which\r\nit carries almost in an upright position on its posterior segments. Later\r\non in life this case becomes too heavy to be held vertically, and is\r\nafterwards dragged along by the larva, and often allowed to hang downwards.\r\nThe case has two apertures--a large one in front, through which the head of\r\nthe larva is projected, and a smaller one at the posterior extremity, which\r\nallows the pellets of excrement to fall out of the case, as soon as they\r\nare evacuated.\r\n\r\nOwing to the apterous and completely helpless condition of the female\r\nimago, it is evident that the dispersal of this insect must take place in\r\nthe larval state. Distribution is of course quite impossible without a\r\nfemale being transported in some way, and from observations made on a good\r\nmany larvæ of various ages, I am disposed to think that the migration of\r\nthis insect to new localities takes place at an early age, possibly soon\r\nafter its emergence from the egg. On this account I think that the\r\noccurrence of the moth in both North and South Islands is of great\r\ninterest, as it would seem to indicate the existence of some connection\r\nbetween the two islands, at a period not sufficiently remote to have\r\nallowed any appreciable modification to take place in the insect's\r\nstructure and habits. At the same time, it should be borne in mind, that\r\nthe protection afforded the larva by its case, and its ability to feed on\r\nso many different plants, may have rendered any modification unnecessary\r\nfor the preservation of the species during recent times. The length of the\r\nfull-grown caterpillar is about 1 inch. The head is dull yellow speckled\r\nwith black. The first three segments are very hard, dark brown, with\r\nnumerous white markings. The remaining segments are considerably thickened\r\nnear the middle of the insect, rudimentary prolegs being present on the\r\nseventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth segments of the larva. The anal prolegs\r\nare very strong, and are furnished with numerous sharp hooklets, which\r\nretain the larva very firmly in its case. As the caterpillar grows, it\r\nincreases the length of its domicile from the anterior, causing it\r\ngradually to assume a more tubular form, tapering towards the posterior\r\naperture, which is enlarged from time to time. The outside is covered with\r\nnumerous fragmentary leaves and twigs of various sizes, placed\r\nlongitudinally on the case, and, frequently, near the anterior aperture the\r\nmaterials, owing to their recent selection, are fresh and green. The\r\ninterior is lined with soft, smooth silk of a light brown colour, the\r\nthickness of the whole fabric being about the same as that of an ordinary\r\nkid glove, and so strong that it is impossible to tear it, or indeed to cut\r\nit, except with sharp instruments. The size of the case, when the\r\ncaterpillar is mature, varies considerably, ranging from 2¼ to 3 inches or\r\nmore in length, and about ¼ inch in diameter, the widest portion being a\r\nlittle behind the anterior aperture.\r\n\r\nDuring the day the larva closes the entrance, and spins a loop of very\r\nstrong silk {125}over a twig, the ends being joined to the upper edges of\r\nthe case on each side; in this way it hangs suspended, the caterpillar\r\nlying snugly within. I have often known a larva to remain thus for over\r\nthree weeks without moving, and afterwards resume feeding as before; this\r\nprobably occurs whilst the inmate is engaged in changing its skin. At night\r\nthe larvæ may be seen busily engaged: they project the head and first four\r\nsegments of the body beyond the case, and walk about with considerable\r\nrapidity, often lowering themselves by means of silken threads; the only\r\nlocomotive organs are, of course, their strong thoracic legs, which appear\r\nto easily fulfil their double function of moving both larva and case. If\r\ndisturbed, these insects at once retreat into their cases, closing the\r\nanterior aperture with a silken cord, which is kept in readiness for the\r\npurpose, and pulled from the inside by the retreating larva. This operation\r\nis most rapidly performed, as the upper edges of the case are flexible, and\r\nthus fold closely together, completely obstructing the entrance. When full\r\ngrown, this caterpillar fastens its case to a branch with a loop of strong\r\nsilk, which is drawn very tight, preventing the case from swinging when the\r\nplant is moved by the wind, and also rendering the insect's habitation more\r\ninconspicuous, by causing it to resemble a broken twig. The anterior\r\naperture is completely closed, the loose edges being drawn together and\r\nfastened like a bag. The posterior end of the case is twisted up for some\r\nlittle distance above the extremity, thus completely closing the opening\r\nthere situated. It is lined inside with a layer of very soft silk spun\r\nloosely over the sides, and partly filling up each end. In the centre of\r\nthis the pupa lies with its head towards the lower portion of the case, the\r\nold larval skin being thrust backwards amongst the loose silk above the\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\nThe male and female pupæ may very easily be distinguished. The male pupa is\r\nrather attenuated, and has all the organs of the future moth plainly\r\nindicated on the integument, as is usual with lepidopterous pupæ. The\r\nfemale pupa, on the contrary, is merely a chain of segments, with a few\r\nfaint indications of rudimentary organs on the anterior extremity. It is,\r\nmoreover, much larger than the male pupa.\r\n\r\nThe insect remains in this condition during the winter months. About\r\nSeptember the male pupa works its way down to the lower end of the case,\r\nforces open the old aperture there situated, and projects the head and\r\nthorax, the pupa being secured from falling by the spines on its posterior\r\nsegments, which retain a firm hold in the silk. Its anterior portion then\r\nbreaks open, and the moth makes its escape, clinging to the outside of its\r\nold habitation, and drying its wings.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect must be about from September till December, but I have\r\nnever then observed it. The only specimen I have seen was noticed flying\r\nvery rapidly in the street in Wellington, in July. I was at first unable to\r\ntell what species it was, as it had a most unusual appearance on the wing,\r\nbut its subsequent near approach enabled me to ascertain for certain that\r\nit was a specimen of this insect. In captivity I have also noticed the\r\nextreme activity of the male when first emerged. Indeed this moth is so\r\nvivacious, that it often happens, owing to the emergence usually taking\r\nplace very early in the morning, that specimens are more or less injured by\r\ntheir efforts to escape, before they are discovered in the breeding cage.\r\nThis restless energy of the male is no doubt essential to the insect's\r\nwell-being, as the females, hidden away in their cases and incapable of any\r\nmovement, must of necessity be very hard to discover. The power of\r\nlocomotion lost in the one sex is thus doubled in the other. Considering\r\nthe protection {126}afforded this insect by the case, which it inhabits\r\nduring its preparatory stages, its enormous mortality from the attacks of a\r\nparasitic dipteron (_Eurigaster marginatus_) is very remarkable. In this\r\nconnection the following analysis of 38 cases, gathered at random, may be\r\nof interest:--\r\n\r\n  26 had parasites.\r\n   8 were dead.\r\n   2 contained eggs.\r\n   2 contained living pupæ, 1 male and 1 female respectively.\r\n\r\nAmongst some of these parasites I once obtained a specimen, which was in\r\nits turn infested by a secondary or hyper-parasite, belonging to the genus\r\n_Pteromalus_, in the order Hymenoptera. Eighteen of these minute insects\r\nemerged from a single pupa of _E. marginatus_. The method by which the\r\n_Pteromalus_ introduces its eggs into the dipterous larva, which is in its\r\nturn enclosed in a caterpillar, is not at present known to entomologists;\r\nbut it seems probable that the eggs of the hyper-parasite are either\r\ndeposited in the eggs of the dipterous insect, or else on the very young\r\nlarvæ, before they penetrate the skin of the caterpillar.[66]\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 2.--OROPHORA, Fereday.\r\n\r\n  \"Ocelli present.

The female is apterous.\r\n\r\nThe life-history is thus described by Mr. Fereday: \"I have never seen the\r\nlarva. Its case measures in length about 16 lines (1-3/8 inches); the\r\nexterior is covered with pieces of stems of grass from a line to 5 lines in\r\nlength, laid longitudinally and in the manner of thatch; the interior is\r\nthinly lined with fine silk. The cases are found fixed to the twigs of the\r\nWild Irishman (_Discaria toumatou_), but it may be inferred from the\r\ncovering of the case, that it probably does not feed on the shrub but upon\r\nthe tussock grass, generally growing where the shrub is found. It is some\r\nyears since I found the cases on _Discaria toumatou_, growing in the\r\nriver-beds of the Rakaia and Waimakariri, on the Canterbury Plains, and I\r\ndid not find any case in its earlier stage before the larva had fed up and\r\nchanged into the pupa state.\"[67]\r\n\r\nAll Mr. Fereday's specimens were bred from the cases, and to the best of my\r\nbelief no one has ever observed the insect on the wing. It is evidently a\r\nvery scarce species, and is probably restricted to a few river-beds in the\r\nSouth Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{127}VII.--THE TORTRICINA.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot dealt with in this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.--THE TINEINA.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot dealt with in this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.--THE MICROPTERYGINA.\r\n\r\nThe following are the principal characters of the _Micropterygina_:--\r\n\r\n  \"Fore-wings with an oblique membranous dorsal process (jugum) near base,\r\n  forming with the dorsal margin a notch or sinus, which receives the costa\r\n  of the hind-wings.

Fore-wings and hind-wings more than usually remote at origin.\r\n\r\n\"In the two families, which constitute this highly interesting group, is\r\nfortunately preserved a type of _Lepidoptera_ whose existence could never\r\nhave been inferred from a study of other forms. Without a knowledge of\r\nthese two families the true origin of the order could never have been more\r\nthan a matter of more or less probable conjecture. The _Micropterygidæ_ are\r\nthe primeval ancestors of all the Lepidoptera, indicating their origin from\r\nthe _Trichoptera_ so nearly that one or two more discoveries might make it\r\nhard to draw any line of demarcation. The _Hepialidæ_ are an offshoot from\r\nthe _Micropterygidæ_ (with considerable extinction of intermediate forms),\r\nconstituting a separate line of development quite unconnected with any\r\nother _Lepidoptera_; if, as is possible, this separate stem may have ever\r\ngiven rise to other branches forming distinct families, all trace of their\r\nexistence seems to have been lost.\r\n\r\n\"Imago with fore-wings and hind-wings more or less semi-oval, termen and\r\ndorsum forming a nearly uniform curve.\r\n\r\n\"Larva with few hairs, with 10 to 16 prolegs, or apodal, living concealed.\r\n\r\n\"Pupa in _Hepialidæ_ with segments 7 to 11 and in male 12, in\r\n_Micropterygidæ_ with all segments free.\"--(Meyrick.)\r\n\r\nIn this work the _Hepialidæ_ alone are dealt with, the _Micropterygidæ_\r\nbeing reserved {128}for a future work. It may, however, again be mentioned\r\nthat the last-named family contains amongst its New Zealand representatives\r\n_Palæomicra chalcophanes_, a species which more closely approximates in\r\nstructure to a Neuropterous insect than does any other member of the\r\n_Lepidoptera_. This insect is consequently regarded by Mr. Meyrick as the\r\nmost ancient species of the order yet known. The survival of _Palæomicra_\r\nin New Zealand is quite in accord with the existence of such forms as\r\n_Apteryx_ and _Dinornis_ amongst the birds, the tuatara lizard\r\n(_Sphenodon_) amongst reptiles, and _Peripatus_ amongst _Myriapoda_,\r\narchaic forms which have been preserved in this country through its long\r\nisolation from continental areas, and the resulting absence of more recent\r\ncompeting forms.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily 1.--HEPIALIDÆ.\r\n\r\n  \"Head rough. Ocelli absent. Tongue obsolete. Maxillary palpi obsolete.\r\n  Tibiæ without spurs. Fore-wings with all main veins and costa connected\r\n  by bars near base, 1_b_ furcate, forked parting vein strong.\" (Plate I.,\r\n  figs. 22, 23, 24, 28, 29.)\r\n\r\n\"By no means an extensive family, yet of universal distribution. It stands\r\nmore conspicuously isolated than any other group of _Lepidoptera_, for\r\nalthough it is without doubt a terminal development from the\r\n_Micropterygidæ_ (that is one from which no existing family has\r\noriginated), the gap between them is considerable; exotic genera, whilst\r\ndiffering in various details, are remarkably uniform in the more important\r\npeculiarities of structure, and do not at all tend to bridge the gap. The\r\nrelatively large size of the _Hepialidæ_ (of which some species exceed six\r\ninches in expanse of wing) may be attributed to the larval habits, which\r\nrender these insects independent of the seasons or fluctuations of\r\nfood-supply, thus removing the check which ordinarily limits growth. The\r\nmodified type of neuration may have resulted directly from the increase of\r\nsize, involving a great strengthening of the main veins beneath the costa\r\nto support the weight. As a consequence of this strengthening, the flight\r\nof the larger species is very powerful, and to this, combined with a choice\r\nof larval food, which is often rather indiscriminate, may perhaps be\r\nascribed the wide range of the group, rather than to its antiquity. It is\r\nprobably of Indo-Malayan origin, and must have existed in that region long\r\nenough to acquire fixity of type before its dispersal, which, geologically\r\nspeaking, may not have been exceedingly remote.\"--(Meyrick.)\r\n\r\nThere are two genera represented in New Zealand.\r\n\r\n1.

Inst., xxii., 211.)\r\n\r\n(Plate XIII., fig. 16 [M], 17 [F]; Plate III., fig. 23 larva, 30 pupa.)\r\n\r\nThis large and conspicuous insect appears to be generally distributed\r\nthroughout the North Island.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings of the male is 4 inches, of the female\r\n  sometimes fully 5½ inches. The fore-wings of the male are _bright green,\r\n  with a series of paler ring-shaped markings between the veins; an\r\n  irregular row of white spots crosses the wing near the middle_, and a\r\n  small white spot is situated on the costa at the base. The hind-wings are\r\n  very pale yellowish-brown near the body, becoming pure white in the\r\n  middle, and pale green on the termen. The head and thorax are green, the\r\n  abdomen is white, tinged with green at the apex. The female has all the\r\n  wings of a relatively more attenuated shape; _the fore-wings are green,\r\n  mottled with black_; the hind-wings are pale reddish-brown, shaded with\r\n  green near the termen; the abdomen is also reddish-brown, becoming green\r\n  at the extremity.\r\n\r\nThe species is rather variable in both sexes. In the male the white spots\r\non the fore-wings vary considerably in size, and there are occasionally\r\nseveral additional spots near the body. In the female the black markings of\r\nthe fore-wings are sometimes much more extensive than the green ground\r\ncolour. This dark form of the female was described by Butler as a distinct\r\nspecies, under the name of _Charagia hectori_. In both sexes the green\r\ncolouring is occasionally entirely absent, a dull orange-brown taking its\r\nplace. I formerly attributed this peculiarity to the effects of fading, but\r\nMr. Norris has shown me a very perfect specimen of this variety, which he\r\nbred from the pupa, he having noticed the orange-brown colouring\r\nimmediately after the insect emerged.\r\n\r\nThe transformations of this insect are very interesting. The female lays an\r\nenormous number of very small, round, yellowish eggs, which she seems to\r\ndeposit quite indiscriminately. The young larvæ consequently have to find\r\ntheir way along the ground to the stems of their food-plant, a large\r\npercentage no doubt perishing before they succeed in doing so, and this\r\ncircumstance probably accounts for the great number of eggs produced.\r\n\r\nThe food-plants of this species are numerous; the following are a few of\r\nthem: \"wineberry\" or \"currant\" (_Aristotelia racemosa_), apparently the\r\nfavourite; \"manuka\" (_Leptospermum ericoides_); \"ki-ki\" (_Astelia\r\nsolandri_); \"black maire\" (_Olea apetela_); titoki (_Alectryon excelsum_);\r\nand _Melicope_. The larva tunnels the stems of these trees, feeding\r\nentirely on the wood, which it bites off with its strong mandibles.\r\n\r\nFor the most part it inhabits the main stem of the tree, its gallery always\r\nhaving an outlet, which is covered with a curtain of silk and refuse, and\r\nis spun exactly level with the surrounding bark, and very inconspicuous.\r\nThese burrows usually run towards the ground, and are mostly two or three\r\ninches from the surface of the trunk. In some instances the larvæ inhabit\r\nbranches, in which case, if they are small, the tunnels are made near the\r\ncentre. Later on in its life, but probably some time before its\r\ntransformation into the pupa, the caterpillar of this insect constructs a\r\nfar more complicated burrow than the above. It consists of a spacious,\r\nirregular, but shallow cavity, just under the bark, having a very large\r\nopening to the air, which is entirely covered {130}with a thin silken\r\ncurtain, almost exactly the same shape and size as the numerous marks\r\noccurring at intervals on the trunks of many of the trees. Three large\r\ntunnels open into this shallow cavity: one in the centre, which runs into\r\nthe middle of the stem, and one on each side, which run right and left just\r\nunder the bark. These lateral tunnels are usually very short, but sometimes\r\nthey extend half-way round the tree, and occasionally even join one another\r\non the opposite side. The central tunnel has a slightly upward direction\r\nfor a short distance inwards, which effectually prevents it from becoming\r\nflooded in wet weather; afterwards it pursues an almost horizontal course\r\nuntil it reaches the centre of the tree, when it appears to suddenly\r\nterminate. This, however, is not the case, for, if the gallery floor be\r\ncarefully examined a short distance before its apparent termination, a\r\nround trap-door will be found, compactly constructed of very hard, smooth\r\nsilk, and corresponding with the surrounding portion of the tunnel so\r\nexactly that it almost escapes detection. When this lid is lifted a long,\r\nperpendicular shaft is disclosed, which runs down the middle of the tree to\r\na depth of 14 or 16 inches, and is about ½ inch in diameter. The upper end\r\nof this shaft is lined with silk, which forms a framework on which the\r\ntrap-door rests when closed. The lid itself is of a larger size than the\r\norifice which it covers, and this makes it extremely difficult, if not\r\nimpossible, to force it open from the exterior, especially as it always\r\nfits down very closely as long as the insect remains in its burrow. The\r\nobject of this contrivance is, no doubt, to prevent the ingress of enemies,\r\nlarge numbers of spiders, slugs, wood-lice, and various orthoptera being\r\nfrequently found in both central and lateral tunnels, but they are quite\r\nunable to pass the trap-door. The galleries of individual larvæ are all\r\nwonderfully alike, the only differences observable being in the length of\r\nthe perpendicular shaft, and in the direction of the horizontal burrow,\r\nwhich is sometimes curved. These variations are usually caused by the\r\npresence of other tunnels in the tree, which the larva appears to carefully\r\navoid; at least I have never known an instance where a larva has allowed\r\nits tunnel to communicate with another one, whether inhabited or otherwise.\r\n\r\n  The caterpillar, when full grown, measures from 2½ to 3 inches in length.\r\n  It is tolerably uniform in thickness, and of a dull yellow colour. The\r\n  head is large, dark brown, very irregularly striated, and covered with a\r\n  few short bristles. The first segment is hard and shining with the back\r\n  and sides ruddy-brown. Its spiracle, which is very large, is situated\r\n  near the posterior margin, and a little above it there is a dull black\r\n  spot, filling a slight concavity about the same size as the spiracle\r\n  itself. Each remaining segment has on its dorsal surface two horny\r\n  plates, and two similar plates are situated on each side immediately\r\n  below the spiracle. The body of the larva is thinly covered with yellow\r\n  and black bristles. In many specimens the ventral surface and connecting\r\n  membrane between the horny plates is pale purple. Younger specimens\r\n  differ in being of an olive-green colour, which is much more pronounced,\r\n  when they are small.\r\n\r\nThe last act performed by the caterpillar, prior to undergoing its\r\ntransformation, is the construction of the above-described trap-door at the\r\ntop of its burrow. This done the insect retreats to the bottom, its\r\nposterior segment resting on the termination of the vertical gallery. In\r\nthe course of a few days the skin is cast off and worked downwards to the\r\nbottom of the burrow, underneath the last segment of the pupa.\r\n\r\n  This pupa varies from 2 to 2½ inches in length. It is attenuated in form\r\n  and pale reddish-yellow in colour. The head and dorsal portion of the\r\n  thorax are dark brown and harder than the rest of the body. The edges of\r\n  the abdominal segments are furnished dorsally with a row of small\r\n  {131}hooklets above and below all the divisions; on the ventral surface\r\n  there is only a single row, which is situated in front of each\r\n  articulation.\r\n\r\nAs development progresses in the pupa it becomes darker in colour,\r\nespecially on the wing-cases, where, in some female specimens, the future\r\nblack markings of the moth are quite discernible as long as two months\r\nbefore emergence. Other specimens remain pale in colour until within a\r\nfortnight or three weeks of the appearance of the imago, when the green\r\ncolouring of the wings suddenly becomes visible through their\r\nsemi-transparent envelopes.\r\n\r\nWhen about to emerge the pupa works its way up the vertical tunnel by means\r\nof the above-mentioned hooklets, forces open the trap-door, and wriggles\r\nalong the horizontal burrow until it reaches the air, only the last three\r\nor four segments remaining in the tree. Its anterior portions then break\r\nopen and the moth crawls out and expands its wings in the ordinary way,\r\nresting on the trunk of the tree, until they are of sufficient strength and\r\nhardness for flight.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in October and November. Although it must be\r\ncommon, it is rarely seen; specimens are consequently best obtained in the\r\npupa state and reared in captivity. The easiest way to find the pupa is to\r\npass a straw into the horizontal burrow, and move it about until it touches\r\nthe trap-door. The collector is at once apprised of this circumstance by a\r\ndistinct hollow sound, produced by the straw when it comes in contact with\r\nthe lid, which acts like a miniature drum. If no such sound is heard after\r\nmoving the straw into every possible position, it may be assumed either\r\nthat the insect has left the burrow, or that it is inhabited by a larva\r\nonly. When, however, a pupa is actually discovered, a section of the\r\ntree-trunk should be cut out, extending from about two inches above the\r\nhorizontal burrow to about one foot below it, and the log, thus obtained,\r\ntaken home. Should a number of pupæ be found in one tree the whole trunk\r\nmay then be taken, if practicable, and kept in a well-lighted room or a\r\nconservatory, until the enclosed insects emerge. The specimens usually come\r\nout of the pupa at about five or six o'clock in the evening, and if\r\nintended for the cabinet should be killed before dark, as they very soon\r\ninjure themselves when flying.\r\n\r\nThe best time of year to obtain the pupa of this insect is during August\r\nand September, as most of the specimens are then in that condition. Apart\r\nfrom the indications above described, burrows containing larvæ may often be\r\nknown by the fresh pellets of excrement which are present near the opening.\r\nThe vacated burrows frequently have the remains of the old pupa shell at\r\nthe entrance, and generally look gnarled and weather-worn. These\r\nindications are useful as guides to the collector before exploring the\r\nburrow with a straw in the manner above described.\r\n\r\nThis insect is much attracted by light, and in consequence sometimes enters\r\nshop-windows and houses. In fact nearly all the _captured_ specimens are so\r\ntaken, the moth being very rarely found in its native forests. This\r\ncircumstance is no doubt due to its very perfect protective colouring\r\nwhich, notwithstanding its large size, causes it to be almost invisible,\r\nwhen resting on the branch of a tree. On one occasion I discovered a\r\nspecimen in this situation; being obliged to leave it for a short time, I\r\nexperienced the utmost difficulty in finding it again, although I had taken\r\na special note of its position. This species appears to be much persecuted\r\nby insectivorous birds, as we may frequently see its large green wings\r\nlying on the ground, where they are very conspicuous.\r\n\r\n\r\n{132}Genus 2.--PORINA.\r\n\r\n  \"Antennæ ¼-2/5, in male bi-pectinated, or more or less shortly\r\n  bi-dentate.

Zool. Soc. Lond., 1877, 381, pi. xlii. 7.\r\n_Porina enysii_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xxii. 207.)\r\n\r\n(Plate XIII., fig. 9 [M], fig. 10 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis species appears to be confined to the North Island, where it is rather\r\nrare.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings of the male is 2½ inches, of the female 3½\r\n  inches. The fore-wings are dark orange-brown, more or less marbled with\r\n  yellow and dark brown; there is a very variable number of small dull\r\n  white spots margined with black and arranged irregularly on the wing.\r\n  _The hind-wings are pinkish-brown, tinged with ochreous on the termen._\r\n\r\nThis species varies a good deal in the extent of the darker markings, and\r\nnumber and position of the dull white spots. When alive it is usually very\r\nstrongly tinged with pink.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in December and January, and frequents forests.\r\nIt is especially fond of resting on the stems of tree-ferns in the daytime,\r\nwhere, however, it is extremely inconspicuous, and can only be discovered\r\nby very careful searching. It is also very partial to light, and specimens\r\nmight perhaps be secured more plentifully, if a good attracting lamp were\r\nexhibited in a suitable locality.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORINA CHARACTERIFERA, Walk.\r\n\r\n(_Hepialus characterifer_, Walk., Suppl. 594. _Oxycanus impletus_, ib. 598.\r\n_Porina characterifera_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xxii. 208.)\r\n\r\n(Plate XIII., fig. 11 [M].)\r\n\r\nThis fine species has been taken in the North Island at Auckland, Kaitoke,\r\nand Wellington.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 3 inches. The fore-wings are rather\r\n  dull yellow, finely marbled with black; _there are two conspicuous\r\n  irregular black marks a little above the middle of the dorsum. The\r\n  hind-wings are very dark purplish-brown with the cilia yellow, barred\r\n  with brown._ The head and thorax are dull yellow, speckled with black,\r\n  and the abdomen is dark purplish-brown, barred with dull white, with a\r\n  yellow tuft at the apex.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in October, November, and December. At present I\r\nam only aware of four specimens in collections, viz., two in the British\r\nMuseum, taken at Auckland; one in Mr. Meyrick's collection, taken by Mr. H.\r\nB. Kirk on the Rimutaka Ranges, at an elevation of about 1,500 feet; and\r\none kindly given to me by Mr. W. R. Morris, who took it at Wadestown, near\r\nWellington.[69] It is evidently a scarce species, but may be looked for in\r\nthe forest districts of the North Island.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORINA CERVINATA, Walk.\r\n\r\n  (_Elhamma cervinata_, Walk., Suppl. 595. _Porina vexata_, ib. 597.\r\n  _Pielus variolaris_, Gn., Ent. Mo. Mag. v. 1. _Porina fuliginea_, Butl.,\r\n  Cist. Ent. ii. 488. _Porina cervinata_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xxii.\r\n  208.)\r\n\r\n(Plate XIII., fig. 12 [M], fig. 18 variety of [F].)\r\n\r\nThis insect is fairly common, and generally distributed throughout the\r\ncountry. It is very abundant in the Manawatu district.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is about 1½ inches. The fore-wings vary from\r\n  brownish-black to dull yellow; there are several small white spots near\r\n  the base margined with black, and an obscure cloudy central streak,\r\n  sometimes containing one or two minute irregular white marks; near the\r\n  termen a broad, pale, wavy line runs from the costa to the dorsum, and\r\n  contains several elongate dull white spots, margined with black; another\r\n  series of smaller spots is often situated between this line and the\r\n  termen; there is a terminal row of small black spots. The {134}hind-wings\r\n  vary from pale greyish-brown to dull yellow. The cilia of all the wings\r\n  are barred with dark brown.\r\n\r\nThis species is extremely variable. In many cases a large number of the\r\nspots is wanting. Mr. Meyrick states that the northern specimens are more\r\nyellow-ochreous, and more distinctly spotted than the southern ones. He\r\nadds that \"the ochreous forms are easily distinguished from other species\r\nby the numerous spots and the absence of a continuous pale discal streak;\r\nthe fuscous forms are sometimes very similar in colouring to _P. despecta_,\r\nbut they are distinctly shorter-winged, and the compound discal spots\r\nappear to be a good character.\"\r\n\r\nI have taken several specimens of what appears to be a variety of this\r\nspecies on the Tableland of Mount Arthur. It is much paler than the typical\r\nform, the markings much less distinct, and the central portions of the\r\nfore-wings very pale yellow (see fig. 18).\r\n\r\nThe moth appears in October. It is very much attracted by light.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORINA DESPECTA, Walk.\r\n\r\n(_Hepialus despectus_, Walk., Suppl. 594. _Porina despecta_, Meyr., Trans.\r\nN. Z. Inst. xxii. 209.)\r\n\r\n(Plate XIII., fig. 13 [F].)\r\n\r\nThis species has occurred in the South Island, at Christchurch, the Otira\r\nRiver and Lake Wakatipu.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is from 1½ to 1¾ inches. The fore-wings are\r\n  dull brown with several irregular dull white markings near the centre of\r\n  the wing. The hind-wings are also dull brown. In general appearance it\r\n  closely resembles the last-mentioned species (_P. cervinata_), _but may\r\n  always be recognised by its longer and narrower wings, smaller body and\r\n  antennæ, and absence of distinct markings near the termen_.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in January, and is usually taken at light.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORINA  UMBRACULATA, Gn.\r\n\r\n(_Pielus umbraculatus_, Gn., Ent. Mo. Mag. v. 1. _Porina umbraculata_,\r\nMeyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xxii. 209.)\r\n\r\n(Plate XIII., fig. 14 [M].)\r\n\r\nThis species is probably common, and generally distributed throughout the\r\ncountry. It has been taken at Palmerston, North Wellington, Nelson,\r\nChristchurch, Invercargill and Stewart Island.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings of the male is 1¾ inches, of the female 2¼\r\n  inches. The fore-wings are dull yellowish-brown; _in the centre there is\r\n  a broad longitudinal blackish streak, containing a conspicuous straight\r\n  white stripe, occasionally broken into two or three very elongate spots_;\r\n  there are often several black dots along the termen. The hind-wings are\r\n  dull ochreous, strongly tinged with pink towards the base.\r\n\r\nThis species varies considerably in the depth of the ground colour, and in\r\nthe number of the black dots. A blackish shaded line, parallel to the\r\ntermen, is also frequently present. The species may, however, be at once\r\nrecognised by the straight, white, central stripe of the fore-wings.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears from October till January, and is generally\r\ncaptured at light.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORINA SIGNATA, Walk.\r\n\r\n(_Elhamma signata_, Walk., Bomb. 1563. _Porina novæ-zealandiæ_, ib. 1573.\r\n_Porina signata_, Meyr., Trans. N. Z. Inst. xxii. 210.)\r\n\r\n(Plate XIII., fig. 15 [M]; Plate III., fig. 6 larva.)\r\n\r\nApparently an abundant species in the North Island, having been taken\r\n{135}commonly at Napier, Palmerston and Wellington. I suspect it occurs in\r\nthe South Island also, but I have no records of its capture there.\r\n\r\n  The expansion of the wings is from 2 to 2¼ inches. The fore-wings are\r\n  dark brownish-ochreous, becoming dull white near the middle and on the\r\n  termen; _there is a shaded central, longitudinal, blackish band\r\n  containing several white spots, forming an irregular stripe in the middle\r\n  of the wing_; there are also many irregular markings with dull white\r\n  centres, chiefly situated near the veins, and often arranged in two or\r\n  three rows parallel to the termen. All the markings are very variable,\r\n  but the insect may be at once known by the irregular central white\r\n  stripe. When alive the entire colouring is always strongly tinged with\r\n  pink.\r\n\r\nI have often found a large subterranean caterpillar, that I believe to be\r\nthe larva of this insect; but as I have never succeeded in rearing a\r\nspecimen, I cannot assign it to this species with absolute certainty.\r\n\r\n  The length of this larva when full grown is nearly 3 inches. Its colour\r\n  is dirty white, becoming darker on the back. The head is dark brown, very\r\n  rough and horny; the three first segments are also horny on the dorsal\r\n  surface. The rest of the body is very much softer, and is furnished with\r\n  several horny tubercles, each of which emits a long bristle.\r\n\r\nThis larva is very lively when disturbed. It usually disgorges a large\r\nquantity of black juice from the mouth, biting meantime, in order no doubt\r\nto frighten its enemies. It feeds on the roots of various grasses.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect appears in January, February and March, and is often\r\nextremely abundant at light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{137}APPENDIX.\r\n\r\nBY FLORENCE W.

The fruit has a very remarkable\r\n  appearance; it consists of a shining black seed, partially surrounded by\r\n  a bright red fleshy covering.\r\n\r\n  APOCYNUM (the common Periwinkle).\r\n\r\n  ARISTOTELIA RACEMOSA (Wine-berry, New Zealand Currant, Makomako). A\r\n  well-known tree, often found in clearings in the forest, where it usually\r\n  takes the place of the original trees; in fact this plant seems to seize\r\n  on every vacant space. Its leaves are pale green, the flowers are much\r\n  like those of the garden \"flowering currant,\" and the berries are small\r\n  and dark red.\r\n\r\n  BEILSCHMIEDIA TAWA (Tawa tree). A handsome tree, with very long, narrow,\r\n  light green leaves, and smooth bark.\r\n\r\n  BRACHYGLOTTIS REPANDA (Wharangi). One of the early flowering shrubs, with\r\n  large bunches of small, strong-scented, white flowers. The leaves are\r\n  large and pale green, the under side being white.\r\n\r\n  CARMICHÆLIA, or New Zealand Broom.

The bark is pale reddish-brown; the leaves rather\r\n  elongate, dark green, with pale under-side. The flowers closely resemble\r\n  those of the cultivated fuchsia, but are less brightly coloured. This\r\n  plant partially sheds its leaves in winter.\r\n\r\n  GALINIA SETIFOLIA. A large, grass-like plant growing in clumps, with very\r\n  long, dark green leaves, which cut the fingers unless the plant is\r\n  carefully handled. A number of small, brown flowers is situated near the\r\n  top of a tall stem, in the centre of each clump.\r\n\r\n  HALORAGIS ALATA. A herbaceous plant abundant on dry hills; the leaves are\r\n  deeply indented, slightly rough, and arranged on opposite sides of the\r\n  stem. The flowers are small and green; the fruit is a nut with small\r\n  wings attached.\r\n\r\n  LEPTOSPERMUM SCOPARIUM (Manuka, Tea tree). A small tree, growing usually\r\n  in poor soil.

As many mandibulate\r\n     insects possess a true tongue, and the proboscis of the _Lepidoptera_\r\n     is not homologous with the tongue, but with the maxillæ, I think the\r\n     term is very misleading.\r\n\r\n [2] For the examination of the wings taken from _dried_ specimens, I have\r\n     found that immersion in methylated spirits renders the veins visible\r\n     after _partial_ denudation with the camel's-hair brush. With recent\r\n     specimens, however, the scales can easily be _entirely_ removed.\r\n\r\n [3] I have found considerable difficulty and uncertainty in examining the\r\n     neuration of undenuded specimens.\r\n\r\n [4] Entom. xxvi. 220.\r\n\r\n [5] Trans.

The species was described from a single specimen taken\r\n     at Dunedin and now in Mr. Fereday's collection. I have carefully\r\n     examined this specimen, and find that the cilia, although considerably\r\n     injured, are distinctly grey. As, however, I think it undesirable to\r\n     characterize species so closely resembling each other from such meagre\r\n     material, I here regard it as a synonym of _Leucania arotis_.\r\n\r\n[13] Report of American Department of Agriculture, 1881, p. 93.\r\n\r\n[14] Mr. Philpott informs me that the larva of _M. paracausta_ closely\r\n     resembles that of _M. vitiosa_.\r\n\r\n[15] This species has been recently named by Mr. Meyrick, but a description\r\n     of it has not yet been published.\r\n\r\n[16] The accurate ascertainment of the positions of the veins near the\r\n     costa in this species is a matter of considerable difficulty owing to\r\n     the extremely dense tuft of hairs there situated.\r\n\r\n[17] Trans.

'Journal of Science,' July, 1884.\r\n\r\n[28] A second specimen of this variety has since occurred in the\r\n     neighbourhood of Nelson.\r\n\r\n[29] Trans. N. Z. Inst. xvi. 60.\r\n\r\n[30] Trans.

From a careful study\r\n     of these specimens I am led to believe that these three forms are\r\n     really only varieties of one very variable species. Mr. Meyrick does\r\n     not at present share this opinion, but I am disposed to think that\r\n     this is chiefly due to the comparatively limited number of specimens\r\n     he has had the opportunity of examining. In any case I do not regard\r\n     the question of the specific or varietal values of these, or indeed of\r\n     any other forms, as matters of great scientific importance, being, to\r\n     a great extent, merely matters of individual opinion.\r\n\r\n[41] Trans. N. Z. Inst. xvi. 57.\r\n\r\n[42] Mr. Meyrick now includes these three species in the genus\r\n     _Gonophylla_. (_See_ Trans. Ent. Soc. Lond. 1897, 387.)\r\n\r\n[43] 'Trans. N. Z.

Mr.\r\n     A. P. Buller has also kindly informed me of the capture of a male\r\n     specimen in perfect condition, at Ohau, Manawatu district, in March,\r\n     1898.\r\n\r\n[50] See notes by Mr. Stainton in the Ent.
