Nine thousand\r\nCongressional troops advancing toward Valparaiso from Quinteros Bay,\r\nwhere they had landed the day previous, were met by Balmaceda's troops\r\non the other side of the river Aconcagua. The Esmeralda and the\r\nMagellanes, co-operating from the sea, made fearful havoc among the\r\nBalmacedists with their machine guns and shell. After a stubborn fight\r\nthe Balmacedists were totally defeated, and were pursued by the\r\nvictorious cavalry, losing 4,000 out of 12,000 in killed, wounded and\r\ndeserters. All their field pieces were captured, and thus the road was\r\nleft open for the Congressionalists to advance on Viña del Mar.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF VIÑA DEL MAR, CHILE.\r\n\r\nA general engagement took place on Aug. 23, 1891, between divisions of\r\nBalmaceda's and the Congressional troops, with the Esmeralda and the\r\nAlmirante Cochrane aiding the latter by firing at Fort Callao,\r\nendeavoring to silence the field batteries at the back. The\r\nCongressional troops failed to capture Viña del Mar, but eventually\r\ncut the railway line a few miles out, and crossed over to the back of\r\nValparaiso, which was soon captured.--_The Graphic._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUN'S MOTION IN SPACE.\r\n\r\nBy A.M. CLERKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nScience needed two thousand years to disentangle the earth's orbital\r\nmovement from the revolutions of the other planets, and the\r\nincomparably more arduous problem of distinguishing the solar share in\r\nthe confused multitude of stellar displacements first presented itself\r\nas possibly tractable a little more than a century ago. In the lack\r\nfor it as yet of a definite solution there is, then, no ground for\r\nsurprise, but much for satisfaction in the large measure of success\r\nattending the strenuous attacks of which it has so often been made the\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nApproximately correct knowledge as to the direction and velocity of\r\nthe sun's translation is indispensable to a profitable study of\r\nsidereal construction; but apart from some acquaintance with the\r\nnature of sidereal construction, it is difficult, if not impossible,\r\nof attainment. One, in fact, presupposes the other. To separate a\r\ncommon element of motion from the heterogeneous shiftings upon the\r\nsphere of three or four thousand stars is a task practicable only\r\nunder certain conditions. To begin with, the proper motions\r\ninvestigated must be established with _general_ exactitude. The errors\r\ninevitably affecting them must be such as pretty nearly, in the total\r\nupshot, to neutralize one another. For should they run mainly in one\r\ndirection, the result will be falsified in a degree enormously\r\ndisproportionate to their magnitude. The adoption, for instance, of\r\nsystem of declinations as much as 1\" of arc astray might displace to\r\nthe extent of 10° north or south the point fixed upon as the apex of\r\nthe sun's way (see L. Boss _Astr. Jour._, No. 213). Risks on this\r\nscore, however, will become less formidable with the further advance\r\nof practical astronomy along a track definable as an asymptote of\r\nideal perfection.\r\n\r\nBesides this obstacle to be overcome, there is another which it will\r\nsoon be possible to evade. Hitherto, inquiries into the solar movement\r\nhave been hampered by the necessity for preliminary assumptions of\r\nsome kind as to the relative distances of classes of stars. But all\r\nsuch assumptions, especially when applied to selected lists, are\r\nhighly insecure; and any fabric reared upon them must be considered to\r\nstand upon treacherous ground. The spectrographic method, however,\r\nhere fortunately comes into play. \"Proper motions\" are only angular\r\nvelocities. They tell nothing as to the value of the perspective\r\nelement they may be supposed to include, or as to the real rate of\r\ngoing of the bodies they are attributed to, until the size of the\r\nsphere upon which they are measured has been otherwise ascertained.\r\nBut the displacement of lines in stellar spectra give directly the\r\nactual velocities relative to the earth of the observed stars. The\r\nquestion of their distances is, therefore, at once eliminated. Now the\r\nradial component of stellar motion is mixed up, precisely in the same\r\nway as the tangential component, with the solar movement; and since\r\ncomplete knowledge of it, in a sufficient number of cases, is rapidly\r\nbecoming accessible, while knowledge of tangential velocity must for a\r\nlong time remain partial or uncertain, the advantage of replacing the\r\ndiscussion of proper motions by that of motions in line of sight is\r\nobvious and immediate. And the admirable work carried on at Potsdam\r\nduring the last three years will soon afford the means of doing so in\r\nthe first, if only a preliminary investigation of the solar\r\ntranslation based upon measurements of photographed stellar spectra.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties, then, caused either by inaccuracies in star\r\ncatalogues or by ignorance of star distances may be overcome; but\r\nthere is a third, impossible at present to be surmounted, and not\r\nwithout misgiving to be passed by. All inquiries upon the subject of\r\nthe advance of our system through space start with an hypothesis most\r\nunlikely to be true. The method uniformly adopted in them--and no\r\nother is available--is to treat the _inherent_ motions of the stars\r\n(their so-called _motus peculiares_) as pursued indifferently in all\r\ndirections. The steady drift extricable from them by rules founded\r\nupon the science of probabilities is presumed to be solar motion\r\nvisually transferred to them in proportions varying with their\r\nremoteness in space, and their situations on the sphere. If this\r\npresumption be in any degree baseless, the result of the inquiry is\r\n_pro tanto_ falsified. Unless the deviations from the parallactic line\r\nof the stellar motions balance one another on the whole, their\r\ndiscussion may easily be as fruitless as that of observations tainted\r\nwith systematic errors. It is scarcely, however, doubtful that law,\r\nand not chance, governs the sidereal revolutions. The point open to\r\nquestion is whether the workings of law may not be so exceedingly\r\nintricate as to produce a grand sum total of results which, from the\r\ngeometrical side, may justifiably be regarded as casual.\r\n\r\nThe search for evidence of a general plan in the wanderings of the\r\nstars over the face of the sky has so far proved fruitless. Local\r\nconcert can be traced, but no widely diffused preference for one\r\ndirection over any other makes itself definitely felt. Some regard,\r\nnevertheless, _must_ be paid by them to the plane of the Milky Way;\r\nsince it is altogether incredible that the actual construction of the\r\nheavens is without dependence upon the method of their revolutions.\r\n\r\nThe apparent anomaly vanishes upon the consideration of the\r\nprofundities of space and time in which the fundamental design of the\r\nsidereal universe lies buried. Its composition out of an indefinite\r\nnumber of partial systems is more than probable; but the inconceivable\r\nleisureliness with which their mutual relations develop renders the\r\nharmony of those relations inappreciable by short-lived terrestrial\r\ndenizens. \"Proper motions,\" if this be so, are of a subordinate kind;\r\nthey are indexes simply to the mechanism of particular aggregations,\r\nand have no definable connection with the mechanism of the whole. No\r\nconsiderable error may then be involved in treating them, for purposes\r\nof calculation, as indifferently directed, and the elicited solar\r\nmovement may genuinely represent the displacement of our system\r\nrelative to its more immediate stellar environment. This is perhaps\r\nthe utmost to be hoped for until sidereal astronomy has reached\r\nanother stadium of progress.\r\n\r\nUnless, indeed, effect should be given to Clerk Maxwell's suggestion\r\nfor deriving the absolute longitude of the solar apex from\r\nobservations of the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites (Proc. Roy. Soc.,\r\nvol. xxx., p. 109). But this is far from likely. In the first place,\r\nthe revolutions of the Jovian system cannot be predicted with anything\r\nlike the required accuracy. In the second place, there is no certainty\r\nthat the postulated phenomena have any real existence. If, however, it\r\nbe safe to assume that the solar system, cutting its way through\r\nspace, virtually raises an ethereal counter-current, and if it be\r\nfurther granted that light travels less _with_ than _against_ such a\r\ncurrent, then indeed it becomes speculatively possible, through slight\r\nalternate accelerations and retardations of eclipses taking place\r\nrespectively ahead of and in the wake of the sun, to determine his\r\nabsolute path in space as projected upon the ecliptic. That is to say,\r\nthe longitude of the apex could be deduced together with the resolved\r\npart of the solar velocity; the latitude of the apex, as well as the\r\ncomponent of velocity perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic,\r\nremaining, however, unknown.\r\n\r\nThe beaten track, meanwhile, has conducted two recent inquirers to\r\nresults of some interest. The chief aim of each was the detection of\r\nsystematic peculiarities in the motions of stellar assemblages after\r\nthe subtraction from them of their common perspective element. By\r\nvarying the materials and method of analysis, Prof. Lewis Boss,\r\nDirector of the Albany Observatory, hopes that corresponding\r\nvariations in the upshot may betray a significant character. Thus, if\r\nstars selected on different principles give notably and consistently\r\ndifferent results, the cause of the difference may with some show of\r\nreason be supposed to reside in specialties of movement appertaining\r\nto the several groups. Prof. Boss broke ground in this direction by\r\ninvestigating 284 proper motions, few of which had been similarly\r\nemployed before (_Astr. Jour._, No. 213). They were all taken from an\r\nequatorial zone 4° 20' in breadth, with a mean declination of +3°,\r\nobserved at Albany for the catalogue of the Astronomische\r\nGesellschaft, and furnished data accordingly for a virtually\r\nindependent research of a somewhat distinctive kind. It was carried\r\nout to three separate conclusions. Setting aside five stars with\r\nsecular movements ranging above 100\", Prof. Boss divided the 279 left\r\navailable into two sets--one of 185 stars brighter, the other of 144\r\nstars fainter than the eighth magnitude. The first collection gave for\r\nthe goal of solar translation a point about 4° north of [alpha] Lyræ,\r\nin R.A. 280°, Decl. +43°; the second, one some thirty-seven minutes of\r\ntime to the west of [delta] Cygni, in R.A. 286°, Decl. +45°. For a\r\nthird and final solution, twenty-six stars moving 40\"-100\" were\r\nrejected, and the remaining 253 classed in a single series. The upshot\r\nof their discussion was to shift the apex of movement to R.A. 289°,\r\nDecl. +51°. So far as the difference from the previous pair of results\r\nis capable of interpretation, it would seem to imply a predominant set\r\ntoward the northeast of the twenty-six swifter motions subsequently\r\ndismissed as prejudicial, but in truth the data employed were not\r\naccurate enough to warrant so definite an inference. The Albany proper\r\nmotions, as Prof. Boss was careful to explain, depend for the most\r\npart upon the right ascensions of Bessel's and Lalande's zones, and\r\nare hence subject to large errors. Their study must be regarded as\r\nsuggestive rather than decisive.\r\n\r\nA better quality and a larger quantity of material was disposed of by\r\nthe latest and perhaps the most laborious investigator of this\r\nintricate problem. M. Oscar Stumpe, of Bonn (_Astr. Nach._, Nos.\r\n2,999, 3,000), took his stars, to the number of 1,054, from various\r\nquarters, if chiefly from Auwers' and Argelander's lists, critically\r\ntesting, however, the movement attributed to each of not less than 16\"\r\na century. This he fixed as the limit of secure determination, unless\r\nfor stars observed with exceptional constancy and care. His discussion\r\nof them is instructive in more ways than one. Adopting, the additional\r\ncomputative burden imposed by it notwithstanding, Schonfeld's\r\nmodification of Airy's formulæ, he introduced into his equations a\r\nfifth unknown quantity expressive of a possible stellar drift in\r\ngalactic longitude. A negative result was obtained. No symptom came to\r\nlight of \"rotation\" in the plane of the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nM. Stumpe's intrepid industry was further shown in disregard of\r\ncustomary \"scamping\" subterfuges. Expedients for abbreviation vainly\r\nspread their allurements; every one of his 2,108 equations was\r\nseparately and resolutely solved. A more important innovation was his\r\nsubstitution of proper motion for magnitude as a criterion of\r\nremoteness. Dividing his stars on this principle into four groups, he\r\nobtained an apex for the sun's translation corresponding to each as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n          Number of         Proper motion.         Apex.\r\nGroup   included stars.       \"      \"              °              °\r\n  I.        551             0.16 to 0.32      R.A. 287.4 Decl.  +42.\r\n II.        340             0.32 to 0.64       \"   279.7  \"      40.5\r\nIII.        105             0.64 to 1.28       \"   287.9  \"      32.1\r\n IV.         58             1.28 and upward    \"   285.2  \"      30.4\r\n\r\nHere again we find a marked and progressive descent of the apex toward\r\nthe equator with the increasing swiftness of the objects serving for\r\nits determination, leading to the suspicion that the most northerly\r\nmay be the most genuine position, because the one least affected by\r\nstellar individualities of movement.\r\n\r\nBy nearly all recent investigations, moreover, the solar _point de\r\nmire_ has been placed considerably further to the east and nearer to\r\nthe Milky Way than seemed admissible to their predecessors; so that\r\nthe constellation Lyra may now be said to have a stronger claim than\r\nHercules to include it; and the necessity has almost disappeared for\r\nattributing to the solar orbit a high inclination to the medial\r\ngalactic plane.\r\n\r\nFrom both the Albany and the Bonn discussions there emerged with\r\nsingular clearness a highly significant relation. The mean magnitudes\r\nof the two groups into which Prof. Boss divided his 279 stars were\r\nrespectively 6.6 and 8.6, the corresponding mean proper motions 21\".9\r\nand 20\".9. In other words, a set of stars on the whole six times\r\nbrighter than another set owned a scarcely larger sum total of\r\napparent displacement. And that this approximate equality of movement\r\nreally denoted approximate equality of mean distance was made manifest\r\nby the further circumstance that the secular journey of the sun proved\r\nto subtend nearly the same angle whichever of the groups was made the\r\nstandpoint for its survey. Indeed, the fainter collection actually\r\ngave the larger angle (13\".73 as against 12\".39), and so far an\r\nindication that the stars composing it were, on an average, nearer to\r\nthe earth than the much brighter ones considered apart.\r\n\r\nA result similar in character was reached by M. Stumpe. Between the\r\nmobility of his star groups, and the values derived from them for the\r\nangular movement of the sun, the conformity proved so close as\r\nmaterially to strengthen the inference that apparent movement measures\r\nreal distance. The mean brilliancy of his classified stars seemed, on\r\nthe contrary, quite independent of their mobility. Indeed, its changes\r\ntended in an opposite direction. The mean magnitude of the slowest\r\ngroup was 6.0, of the swiftest 6.5, of the intermediate pair 6.7 and\r\n6.1. And these are not isolated facts. Comparisons of the same kind,\r\nand leading to identical conclusions, were made by Prof. Eastman at\r\nWashington in 1889 (Phil. Society Bulletin, vol. xii, p. 143;\r\nProceedings Amer. Association, 1889, p. 71).\r\n\r\nWhat meaning can we attribute to them? Uncritically considered, they\r\nseem to assert two things, one reasonable, the other palpably absurd.\r\nThe first--that the average angular velocity of the stars varies\r\ninversely with their distance from ourselves--few will be disposed to\r\ndoubt; the second--that their average apparent luster has nothing to\r\ndo with greater or less remoteness--few will be disposed to admit.\r\nBut, in order to interpret truly, well ascertained if unexpected\r\nrelationships, we must remember that the sensibly moving stars used to\r\ndetermine the solar translation are chosen from a multitude sensibly\r\nfixed; and that the proportion of stationary to traveling stars rises\r\nrapidly with descent down the scale of magnitude. Hence a mean struck\r\nin disregard of the zeros is totally misleading; while the account is\r\nno sooner made exhaustive than its anomalous character becomes largely\r\nmodified. Yet it does not wholly disappear. There is some warrant for\r\nit in nature. And its warrant may perhaps consist in a preponderance,\r\namong suns endowed with high _physical_ speed, of small or slightly\r\nluminous over powerfully radiative bodies. Why this should be so, it\r\nwould be futile, even by conjecture, to attempt to explain.--_Nature._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMAL ORIGIN OF PETROLEUM AND PARAFFIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nR. Zaloziecki, in _Dingl. Polyt. Jour._, gives a lengthy physical and\r\nchemical argument in favor of the modern view that petroleum and\r\nparaffin owe their origin to animal sources; that they are formed from\r\nanimal remains in a manner strictly analogous to that of the formation\r\nof ordinary coal from wood and other vegetable debris. For geological\r\nas well as chemical reasons, the author holds that Mendeleeff's theory\r\nof their igneous origin is untenable, pointing out that the\r\nhydrocarbons could not have been formed by the action of water\r\npercolating through clefts in the gradually solidifying crust until it\r\nreached the molten metallic carbides, as these clefts could only occur\r\nwhere complete solidification had taken place, and between this point\r\nand the metallic stratum a considerable space would be taken up by\r\nsemi-solid, slag-like material which would be quite impervious to\r\nwater. Under the conditions, too, existing beneath the surface of the\r\nearth, such polymerization as is necessary to account for the presence\r\nof the different classes of hydrocarbons found in petroleum is\r\nscarcely credible.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand it is to be specially noticed that, with a few\r\nunimportant exceptions, all bituminous deposits are found in the\r\nsedimentary rocks, and that just as these are constantly changing in\r\ncomposition, so the organic matter present changes, there being a\r\ndefinite relationship between the chemical constitution of the\r\npetroleum and the age of the strata in which it is found. It is almost\r\ncertain that in the most recent alluvial formations no oil is ever\r\nfound, its latest appearance being in the rocks of the tertiary\r\nperiod, the place where the solid paraffin is almost exclusively met\r\nwith; thus helping to show that the latter has been formed from the\r\ndecomposition of the oil, and is not a residue remaining after the oil\r\nhas been distilled off. To this conclusion the fact also strongly\r\npoints, that the paraffin is much simpler in constitution, purer, and\r\noften of far lighter color than the crude oil, which could not be the\r\ncase if it were the original substance.\r\n\r\nOn examining by the aid of a map the position of the chief oil-bearing\r\nlocalities it will be noticed that the most prolific spots follow\r\nfairly accurately the contour lines of the country, so that at one\r\ntime they formed in all probability a coast line whereon would be\r\nconcentrated for climatic reasons most of the animal life both of the\r\nland and sea. During succeeding generations their dead bodies would\r\naccumulate in enormous quantities and be buried in the slowly\r\ndepositing sand and mud, till, owing to the gradual alterations of\r\nlevel, the sea no longer reached the same point. This theory is borne\r\nout by the fact that oil deposits are usually found in marine\r\nsediments, sea fossils being frequently met with. The first process of\r\nthe decomposition of the animal remains would consist in the formation\r\nof ammonia and nitrogenous bases, the action being aided by the\r\npresence of air, moisture, and micro-organisms, at the same time,\r\nowing to the well known antiseptic properties of salt, the\r\ndecomposition would go on slowly, allowing time for more sand and\r\ninorganic matter to be deposited. In this way the decomposing matter\r\nwould be gradually protected from the action of the air, and finally\r\nthe various fatty substances would be found mixed with large amounts\r\nof salt, under considerable pressure, and at a somewhat high\r\ntemperature. From this adipocere, fatty acids would be gradually\r\nformed, the glycerol being washed away, and finally the acids would be\r\ndecomposed by the pressure into hydrocarbons and free carbonic acid\r\ngas. That many of these hydrocarbons would be solid at ordinary\r\ntemperatures, forming the so-called mineral wax, which exists in many\r\nplaces in large quantities, is much easier to imagine, in the light of\r\nmodern chemical knowledge, than that the fatty acids were at once\r\nsplit up into the simpler liquid hydrocarbons, to be afterward\r\ncondensed into the more complex molecular forms of the solid\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nIn this way from animal matter are in all probability formed the vast\r\npetroleum deposits, the three substances, adipocere, ozokerite, and\r\npetroleum oil being produced in chronological order, just as lignite,\r\nbrown coal and coal are formed by the gradual decomposition of\r\nvegetable remains.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF PETROLEUM.[1]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: Abstract of a paper read before the British\r\n  Association, Cardiff meeting, 1891, Section G.]\r\n\r\nBy O.C.D. Ross, M.Inst.C.E.\r\n\r\n\r\nPetroleum is one of the most widely distributed substances in nature,\r\nbut the question how it was originally produced has never yet been\r\nsatisfactorily determined, and continues a problem for philosophers.\r\nIn 1889 the total production exceeded 2,600,000,000 gallons, or about\r\n10,000,000 tons, and, at fourpence per gallon, was worth about\r\n£44,000,000, while the recognition of its superior utility as an\r\neconomical source of light, heat, and power steadily increases; but,\r\nnotwithstanding its importance in industry, the increasing abundance\r\nof the foreign supply, and the ever-widening area of production,\r\npractical men in England continue to distrust its permanence, and\r\nowing to the mystery surrounding its origin, and the paucity of\r\nindications where and how to undertake the boring of wells, they\r\nhesitate to seek for it in this country, or even to extend the use of\r\nit whenever that would involve alterations of existing machinery. The\r\nobject of this paper is to suggest an explanation of the mystery which\r\nseems calculated to dissipate that distrust, since it points to very\r\nabundant stores, both native and foreign, yet undiscovered, and even\r\nin some localities to daily renovated provisions of this remarkable\r\noil.\r\n\r\nThe theories of its origin suggested by Reichenbach, Berthelot,\r\nMendeleeff, Peckham, and others, made no attempt to account for the\r\nexceeding variety in its chemical composition, in its specific\r\ngravity, its boiling points, etc., and are all founded on some\r\nhypothetical process which differs from any with which we are\r\nacquainted; but modern geologists are agreed that, as a rule, the\r\nrecords of the earth's history should be read in accordance with those\r\nlaws of nature which continue in force at the present day, e.g., the\r\ndecomposition of fish and cetaceous animals could not now produce oil\r\ncontaining paraffin. Hence we can hardly believe it was possible\r\nthousands or millions of years ago, if it can be proved that any of\r\nthe processes of nature with which we are familiar is calculated to\r\nproduce it.\r\n\r\nThe chief characteristics of petroleum strata are enumerated as:\r\n\r\n    I. The existence of adjoining beds of limestone, gypsum, etc.\r\n\r\n    II. The evidence of volcanic action in close proximity to\r\n    them.\r\n\r\n    III. The presence of salt water in the wells.\r\n\r\nI. All writers have noticed the presence of limestone close to\r\npetroleum fields in the United States and Canada, in the Caucasus, in\r\nBurma, etc., but they have been most impressed by its being\r\n\"fossiliferous,\" or shell limestone, and have drawn the erroneous\r\ninference that the animal matter once contained in those shells\r\noriginated petroleum; but no fish oil ever contained paraffin. On the\r\nother hand, the fossil shells are carbonate of lime, and, as such,\r\ncapable of producing petroleum under conditions such as many limestone\r\nbeds have been subjected to in all ages of the earth's history. All\r\nlimestone rocks were formed under water, and are mainly composed of\r\ncalcareous shells, corals, encrinites, and foraminfera--the latter\r\nsimilar to the foraminfera of \"Atlantic ooze\" and of English chalk\r\nbeds. Everywhere, under the microscope, the original connection of\r\nlimestone with organic matter--its organic parentage, so to speak, and\r\ncousinship with the animal and vegetable kingdoms--is conspicuous.\r\nWhen pure it contains 12 per cent. of carbon.\r\n\r\nNow petroleum consists largely of carbon, its average composition\r\nbeing 85 per cent. of carbon and 15 per cent. of hydrogen, and in the\r\nlimestone rocks of the United Kingdom alone there is a far larger\r\naccumulation of carbon than in all the coal measures the world\r\ncontains. A range of limestone rock 100 miles in length by 10 miles in\r\nwidth, and 1,000 yards in depth, would contain 743,000 million tons of\r\ncarbon, or sufficient to provide carbon for 875,000 million tons of\r\npetroleum. Deposits of oil-bearing shale have also limestone close at\r\nhand; e.g., coral rag underlies Kimmeridge clay, as it also underlies\r\nthe famous black shale in Kentucky, which is extraordinarily rich in\r\noil.\r\n\r\nII. As evidence of volcanic action in close proximity to petroleum\r\nstrata, the mud volcanoes at Baku and in Burma are described, and a\r\nsulphur mine in Spain is mentioned (with which the writer is well\r\nacquainted), situated near an extinct volcano, where a perpetual gas\r\nflame in a neighboring chapel and other symptoms indicate that\r\npetroleum is not far off. While engaged in studying the geological\r\nconditions of this mine, the author observed that Dr. Christoff\r\nBischoff records in his writings that he had produced sulphur in his\r\nown laboratory by passing hot volcanic gases through chalk, which,\r\nwhen expressed in a chemical formula, leads at once to the postulate\r\nthat, in addition to sulphur, _ethylene_, and all its homologues\r\n(C_{n}H_{2n}), which are the oils predominating at Baku, would be\r\nproduced by treating:\r\n\r\n  2, 3, 4,  5 equivs. of carbonate of lime (limestone) with\r\n  2, 3, 4,  5   \"        sulphurous acid (SO_{2}) and\r\n  4, 6, 8, 10  \"         sulphureted hydrogen (H_{2}S);\r\n\r\nand that marsh gas and its homologues, which are the oils\r\npredominating in Pennsylvania, would be produced by treating:\r\n\r\n  1, 2, 3, 4, 5 equivs. of carbonate of lime with\r\n  1, 2, 3, 4, 5   \"        sulphurous acid and\r\n  3, 5, 7, 9, 11  \"        sulphureted hydrogen.\r\n\r\nThus we find that:\r\n\r\n  Carbonate of lime, 2CaCO_{3},  }         { 2(CaSO.H_{2}O) (gypsum),\r\n  Sulphurous acid, 2SO_{2}, and  }  yield  { 4S (sulphur), and\r\n  Sulphureted hydrogen, 4H_{2}S, }         { C_{2}H_{4}, which is\r\n                                           { _ethylene_.\r\n\r\nAnd that:\r\n\r\n  Carbonate of lime, CaCO_{3}    }         { (CaSO_{4}.H_{2}O) (gypsum),\r\n  Sulphurous acid, SO_{2}, and   }  yield  { 3S (sulphur) and\r\n  Sulphureted hydrogen, 3H_{2}S, }         { CH4, which is marsh gas.\r\n\r\nSo that these and all their homologues, in fact petroleum in all its\r\nvarieties, would be produced in nature by the action of volcanic gases\r\non limestone.\r\n\r\nBut much the most abundant of the volcanic gases appear at the surface\r\nas steam, and petroleum seems to have been more usually produced\r\nwithout sulphurous acid, and with part of the sulphureted hydrogen\r\n(H_{2}S) replaced by H_{2}O (steam) or H_{2}O_{2} (peroxide of\r\nhydrogen), which is the product that results from the combination of\r\nsulphureted hydrogen and sulphurous acid:\r\n\r\n    (H_{2}S + SO_{2} == H_{2}O_{2} + 2S).\r\n\r\nIt is a powerful oxidizing agent, and it converts sulphurous into\r\nsulphuric acid. Thus:\r\n\r\n  CaCO_{3}  }         { CaSO_{4}.H_{2}O (gypsum)\r\n  H_{2}S,   }  yield  { and\r\n  2H_{2}O,  }         { CH_{4}, which is marsh gas.\r\n\r\nAnd\r\n\r\n  2CaCO_{3},    }         { 2CaSO_{4}.H_{2}O\r\n  2H_{2}S,      }  yield  { and\r\n  2H_{2}O_{2},  }         { C_{2}H_{4}, which is _ethylene._\r\n\r\nTables are given showing the formulæ for the homologues of ethylene\r\nand marsh gas resulting from the increase in regular gradation of the\r\nsame constituents.\r\n\r\n   _Formulæ Showing how Ethylene and its Homologues\r\n   (C_{n}H_{2}{n}) are Produced by the Action of the Volcanic\r\n   Gases H_{2}S and H_{2}O_{2} on Limestone._\r\n\r\nCarbonate  Sulphureted Peroxide of                 Ethylene and\r\n of lime.   hydrogen.   hydrogen.

Descriptions of the action of\r\nsolfataras by the late Sir Richard Burton and by a British consul in\r\nIceland are quoted, and also a paragraph from Lyall's \"Principles of\r\nGeology,\" in which he remarks of the mud volcanoes at Girgenti\r\n(Sicily) that _carbureted hydrogen_ is discharged from them, sometimes\r\nwith great violence, and that they are known to have been casting out\r\nwater, mixed with mud and _bitumen_, with the same activity as now for\r\nthe last fifteen centuries. Probably at all these solfataras, if the\r\ngases traverse limestone, fresh deposits of oil-bearing strata are\r\naccumulating, and the same volcanic action has been occurring during\r\nmany successive geological periods and millions of years; so that it\r\nis difficult to conceive limits to the magnitude of the stores of\r\npetroleum which may be awaiting discovery in the subterranean\r\ndepths.[2]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 2: Professor J. Le Conte, when presiding recently at the\r\n  International Geological Congress at Washington, mentioned that in\r\n  the United States extensive lava floods have been observed,\r\n  covering areas from 10,000 to 100,000 square miles in extent and\r\n  from 2,000 to 4,000 feet deep. We have similar lava flows and\r\n  ashes in the North of England, in Scotland, and in Ireland,\r\n  varying from 3,000 to 6,000 feet in depth. In the Lake District\r\n  they are nearly 12,000 feet deep. Solfataras are active during the\r\n  intermediate, or so-called \"dormant,\" periods which occur between\r\n  acute volcanic eruptions.]\r\n\r\nGypsum may also be an indication of oil-bearing strata, for the\r\nsubstitution in limestone of sulphuric for carbonic acid can only be\r\naccounted for by the action of these hot sulphurous gases. Gypsum is\r\nfound extensively in the petroleum districts of the United States, and\r\nit underlies the rock salt beds at Middlesboro, where, on being\r\npierced, it has given passage to oil gas, which issues abundantly,\r\nmixed with brine, from a great depth.\r\n\r\nIII. Besides the space occupied by \"natural gas,\" which is very\r\nextensive, 17,000 million gallons of petroleum have been raised in\r\nAmerica since 1860, and that quantity must have occupied more than\r\n100,000,000 cubic yards, a space equal to a subterranean cavern 100\r\nyards wide by 20 feet deep, and 82 miles in length, and it is\r\nsuggested that beds of \"porous sandstone\" could hardly have contained\r\nso much; while vast receptacles may exist, carved by volcanic water\r\nout of former beds of rock salt adjoining the limestone, which would\r\naccount for the brine that usually accompanies petroleum. It is\r\nfurther suggested that when no such vacant spaces were available, the\r\nhydrocarbon vapors would be absorbed into, and condensed in,\r\ncontiguous clays and shales, and perhaps also in beds of coal, only\r\npartially consolidated at the time.\r\n\r\nThere is an extensive bituminous limestone formation in Persia,\r\ncontaining 20 per cent. of bitumen, and the theory elaborated in the\r\npaper would account for bitumen and oil having been found in Canada\r\nand Tennessee embedded in limestone, which fact is cited by Mr.\r\nPeckham as favoring his belief that some petroleums are a \"product of\r\nthe decomposition of animal remains.\"\r\n\r\nAbove all, this theory accounts for the many varieties in the chemical\r\ncomposition of paraffin oils in accordance with ordinary operations of\r\nnature during successive geological periods.--_Chem.

Mcgillivray, who has been for many years in the United States\r\nmineral survey service, has some interesting things to say about the\r\noverflow of the Colorado desert, which has excited so much comment,\r\nand about which so many different stories have been told:\r\n\r\n\"None of the papers, so far as I know,\" said Mr. McGillivray, \"have\r\ndescribed with much accuracy or detail the interesting thing which has\r\nhappened in the Colorado desert or have stated how it happened. The\r\nColorado desert lies a short distance northwest of the upper end of\r\nthe Gulf of California, and contains not far from 2,500 square miles.\r\nThe Colorado River, which has now flooded it, has been flowing along\r\nto the east of it, emptying into the Gulf of California. The surface\r\nof the desert is almost all level and low, some of it below the sea\r\nlevel. Some few hundreds of years ago it was a bay making in from the\r\nGulf of California, and then served as the outlet of the Colorado\r\nRiver. But the river carried a good deal of sediment, and in time made\r\na bar, which slowly and surely shut off the sea on the south, leaving\r\nonly a narrow channel for the escape of the river, which cut its way\r\nout, probably at some time when it was not carrying much sediment.\r\nThen the current became more rapid and cut its way back into the land,\r\nand, in doing this, did not necessarily choose the lowest place, but\r\nrather the place where the formation of the land was soft and easily\r\ncut away by the action of the water.\r\n\r\n\"While the river was cutting its way back it was, of course, carrying\r\nmore or less sediment, and this was left along the banks, building\r\nthem all the time higher, and confining the river more securely in its\r\nbounds. That is the Colorado River as we have known it ever since its\r\ndiscovery. Meantime, the water left in the shallow lake, cut off from\r\nthe flow of the river, gradually evaporated--a thing that would take\r\nbut a few years in that country, where the heat is intense and the\r\nhumidity very low. That left somewhere about 2,000 miles of desert\r\nland, covered with a deposit of salt from the sea water which had\r\nevaporated, and most of it below the level of the sea. That is the\r\nColorado desert as it has been known since its discovery.\r\n\r\n\"Then, last spring, came the overflow which has brought about the\r\npresent state of affairs. The river was high and carrying an enormous\r\namount of sediment in proportion to the quantity of water. This\r\ngradually filled up the bed of the stream and caused it to overflow\r\nits banks, breaking through into the dry lake where it had formerly\r\nflowed. The fact that the water is salt, which excited much comment at\r\nthe time the overflow was first discovered, is, of course, due to the\r\nfact that the salt in the sea water which evaporated hundreds of years\r\nago has remained there all the time, and is now once more in solution.\r\n\r\n\"The desert will, no doubt, continue to be a lake and the outlet of\r\nthe river unless the breaks in the banks of the river are dammed by\r\nartificial means, which seems hardly possible, as the river has been\r\nflowing through the break in the stream 200 feet wide, four feet deep,\r\nand flowing at a velocity of five feet a second.\r\n\r\n\"It is an interesting fact to note that the military survey made in\r\n1853 went over this ground and predicted the very thing which has now\r\nhappened. The flooding of the desert will be a good thing for the\r\nsurrounding country, for it does away with a large tract of absolutely\r\nuseless land, so barren that it is impossible to raise there what the\r\nman in Texas said they mostly raised in his town, and it will increase\r\nthe humidity of the surrounding territory. Nature has done with this\r\npiece of waste land what it has often been proposed to do by private\r\nenterprise or by public appropriation. Congress has often been asked\r\nto make an appropriation for that purpose.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McGillivray had also some interesting things to say about Death\r\nValley, which he surveyed.\r\n\r\n\"It has been called a _terra incognita_ and a place where no human\r\nbeing could live. Well, it is bad enough, but perhaps not quite so bad\r\nas that. The great trouble is the scarcity of water and the intense\r\nheat. But many prospecting parties go there looking for veins of ore\r\nand to take out borax. The richest borax mines in the world are found\r\nthere. The valley is about 75 miles long by 10 miles wide. The lowest\r\npoint is near the center, where it is about 150 ft. below the level of\r\nthe sea. Just 15 miles west of this central point is Telescope peak,\r\n11,000 ft. above the sea, and 15 miles east is Mt. Le Count, in the\r\nFuneral mountains, 8,000 ft. high. The valley runs almost due north\r\nand south, which is one reason for the extreme heat. The only stream\r\nof water in or near the valley flows into its upper end and forms a\r\nmarsh in the bed of the valley. This marsh gives out a horrible odor\r\nof sulphureted hydrogen, the gas which makes a rotten egg so\r\noffensive. Where the water of this stream comes from is not very\r\ndefinitely known, but in my opinion it comes from Owen's lake, beyond\r\nthe Telescope mountains to the west, flowing down into the valley by\r\nsome subterranean passage. The same impurities found in the stream are\r\nalso found in the lake, where the water is so saturated with salt,\r\nboracic acid, etc., that one can no more sink in it than in the water\r\nof the Great Salt lake; and I found it so saturated that after\r\nswimming in it a little while the skin all over my body was gnawed and\r\nmade very sore by the acids. Another reason why I think the water of\r\nthe stream enters the valley by some fixed subterranean source is the\r\nfact that, no matter what the season, the flow from the springs that\r\nfeed the marsh is always exactly the same.\r\n\r\n\"The heat there is intense. A man cannot go an hour without water\r\nwithout becoming insane. While we were surveying there, we had the\r\nsame wooden cased thermometer that is used by the signal service. It\r\nwas hung in the shade on the side of our shed, with the only stream in\r\nthe country flowing directly under it, and it repeatedly registered\r\n130°; and for 48 hours in 1883, when I was surveying there, the\r\nthermometer never once went below 104°.\"--_Boston Herald._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEMLOCK AND PARSLEY.\r\n\r\nBy W.W. BAILEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study of the order Umbelliferæ presents peculiar difficulties to\r\nthe beginner, for the flowers are uniformly small and strikingly\r\nsimilar throughout the large and very natural group. The family\r\ndistinctions or features are quite pronounced and unmistakable, and it\r\nis the determination of the genera which presents obstacles--serious,\r\nindeed, but not insurmountable. \"By their fruits shall ye know them.\"\r\n\r\nThe Umbelliferæ, as we see them here, are herbaceous, with hollow,\r\noften striated stems, usually more or less divided leaves, and no\r\nstipules. Occasionally we meet a genus, like Eryngium or Hydrocotyle,\r\nwith leaves merely toothed or lobed. The petioles are expanded into\r\nsheaths; hence the leaves wither on the stem. The flowers are usually\r\narranged in simple or compound umbels, and the main and subordinate\r\nclusters may or may not be provided with involucres and involucels. To\r\nthis mode of arrangement there are exceptions. In marsh-penny-wort\r\n(Hydrocotyle) the umbels are in the axils of the leaves, and scarcely\r\nnoticeable; in Eryngium and Sanicula they are in heads. The calyx is\r\ncoherent with the two-celled ovary, and the border is either obsolete\r\nor much reduced. There are five petals inserted on the ovary, and\r\nexternal to a fleshy disk. Each petal has its tip inflexed, giving it\r\nan obcordate appearance. The common colors of the corolla are white,\r\nyellow, or some shade of blue. Alternating with the petals, and\r\ninserted with them, are the five stamens.\r\n\r\nThe fruit, upon which so much stress is laid in the study of the\r\nfamily, is compound, of two similar parts or carpels, each of which\r\ncontains a seed. In ripening the parts separate, and hang divergent\r\nfrom a hair-like prolongation of the receptacle known as the\r\ngynophore. Each half fruit (mericarp) is tipped by a persistent style,\r\nand marked by vertical ribs, between or under which lie, in many\r\ngenera, the oil tubes or vittæ. These are channels containing aromatic\r\nand volatile oil. In examination the botanist makes delicate cross\r\nsections of these fruits under a dissecting microscope, and by the\r\nshape of the fruit and seed within, and by the number and position of\r\nthe ribs and oil tubes, is able to locate the genus. It, of course,\r\nrequires skill and experience to do this, but any commonly intelligent\r\nclass can learn the process. It goes without saying, and as a\r\ncorollary to what has already been stated, that these plants should\r\nalways be collected in full fruit; the flowers are comparatively\r\nunimportant. Any botanist would be justified in declining to name one\r\nof the family not in fruit. An attempt would often be mere guesswork.\r\n\r\nIn this family is found the poison hemlock (Conium) used by the\r\nancient Greeks for the elimination of politicians. It is a powerful\r\npoison. The whole plant has a curious mousy odor. It is of European\r\norigin. Our water hemlock is equally poisonous, and much more common.\r\nIt is the _Cicuta maculata_ of the swamps--a tall, coarse plant which\r\nhas given rise to many sad accidents. _Æthusa cynapium_, another\r\npoisonous plant, known as \"fool's parsley,\" is not uncommon, and\r\ncertainly looks much like parsley. This only goes to show how\r\ndifficult it is for any but the trained botanist to detect differences\r\nin this group of plants. Side by side may be growing two specimens, to\r\nthe ordinary eye precisely alike, yet the one will be innocent and the\r\nother poisonous.\r\n\r\nThe drug asafetida is a product of this order. All the plants appear\r\nto \"form three different principles: the first, a watery acid matter;\r\nthe second, a gum-resinous milky substance; and the third, an\r\naromatic, oily secretion. When the first of these predominates they\r\nare poisonous; the second in excess converts them into stimulants; the\r\nabsence of the two renders them useful as esculents; the third causes\r\nthem to be pleasant condiments.\" So that besides the noxious plants\r\nthere is a long range of useful vegetables, as parsnips, parsley,\r\ncarrots, fennel, dill, anise, caraway, cummin, coriander, and celery.\r\nThe last, in its wild state, is said to be pernicious, but etiolation\r\nchanges the products and renders them harmless. The flowers of all are\r\ntoo minute to be individually pretty, but every one knows how charming\r\nare the umbels of our wild carrot, resembling as they do the choicest\r\nold lace. Frequently the carrot has one central maroon colored floret.\r\n\r\nThough most of the plants are herbs, Dr. Welwitsch found in Africa a\r\ntree-like one, with a stem one to two feet thick, much prized by the\r\nnatives for its medicinal properties, and also valuable for its\r\ntimber. In Kamschatka also they assume a sub-arboreous type, as well\r\nas on the steppes of Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nAs mistakes often occur by confounding the roots of Umbelliferæ with\r\nthose of horse radish or other esculents, it is well, when in doubt,\r\nto send the plants, _always in fruit_, if possible, for\r\nidentification. None of them are poisonous to the touch--at least to\r\nordinary people. Cases of rather doubtful authenticity are reported\r\nfrom time to time of injury from the handling of wild carrot. We have\r\nalways suspected the proximity of poison ivy; still, it is unwise to\r\ndogmatize on such matters. Some people cannot eat strawberries--more's\r\nthe pity!--while the rest of us get along with them very happily.\r\nLately the _Primula obconica_ has acquired an evil reputation as an\r\nirritant, so there is no telling what may not happen with certain\r\nconstitutions.\r\n\r\nDifficult as is the study of Umbelliferæ, it becomes fascinating on\r\nacquaintance.

(Flowers white.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has often been a matter of astonishment to me that eremuri are not\r\nmore frequently seen in our gardens. There are certainly very few\r\nplants which have a statelier or more handsome appearance during the\r\nsummer months. Both in point of brightness of color and their general\r\nhabit and manner of growth they are very much to be recommended. For\r\nsome reason or other they have the character of being difficult\r\nplants, but they do not deserve it at all, and a very slight attention\r\nto their requirements is enough to ensure success. They can stand a\r\ngood many degrees of frost, and they ask for little more than a soil\r\nwhich has been deeply worked and well enriched with old rotten manure.\r\nGive them this, and they are certain to be contented with it, and the\r\ncultivator will be well rewarded for his pains. Only one thing should\r\nperhaps be added by way of precaution. If an eremurus appears too soon\r\nabove ground, it is well just to cover it over with loose litter of\r\nsome sort, so that it may not be nipped by spring frosts; and one\r\nexperienced grower has said that it answers to lift them after\r\nblossoming, and to keep them out of the ground for a few weeks, so\r\nthat they may be sufficiently retarded. But I have not yet been able\r\nto try this plan myself, and I do not speak from experience about it.\r\nMy favorite is Eremurus Bungei, which I think is one of the handsomest\r\nplants I have in my garden. The clear yellow color of the blossom is\r\nso very good, and I like the foliage also; but of course it is not the\r\nmost imposing by any means and if height and stateliness are\r\nespecially regarded, E. robustus or E. robustus nobilis would carry\r\noff the palm. This commonly rises to the height of eight or nine feet\r\nabove the ground, and on one occasion I have known it to be greatly in\r\nexcess even of that; but such an elevation cannot be attained for more\r\nthan a single year, and it afterward is contented with more moderate\r\nefforts. E. Himalaicus is of the purest possible white, and the spike\r\nis very much to be admired when it is seen at its best. It can be very\r\neasily raised from seed, but a good deal of patience is needed before\r\nits full glory has come. E. Olgæ is the last of all, and it shows by\r\nits arrival that summer is hastening on. It is of a peach-colored hue,\r\nand very pretty indeed. Altogether it is a pity that eremuri are not\r\nmore commonly grown. I think they are certain to give great\r\nsatisfaction, if only a moderate degree of attention and care be\r\nbestowed upon them.--_H.

WEBER, Ph.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the last meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of\r\nScience, Prof. W.R. Lazenby reported his studies on the occurrence of\r\ncrystals in plants. In this report he expressed the opinion that the\r\nacridity of the Indian turnip was due to the presence of these\r\ncrystals or raphides. This opinion was opposed by Prof. Burrill and\r\nother eminent botanists, who claimed that other plants, as the\r\nfuchsia, are not at all acrid, although they contain raphides as\r\nplentifully as the Indian turnip. Here the matter was allowed to rest.\r\n\r\nThe United States Dispensatory and other works on pharmacy ascribe the\r\nacridity of the Indian turnip to an acrid, extremely volatile\r\nprinciple insoluble in water, and alcohol, but soluble in ether.\r\nHeating and drying the bulbs dissipates the volatiles principle, and\r\nthe acridity is destroyed.\r\n\r\nAt a recent meeting of Ohio State Microscopical Society this subject\r\nwas again brought up for discussion. It was thought by some that the\r\nraphides in the different plants might vary in chemical composition,\r\nand thus the difference in their action be accounted for. This\r\nquestion the writer volunteered to answer.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, four plants containing raphides were selected, two of\r\nwhich, the _Calla cassia_ and Indian turnip, were highly acrid, and\r\ntwo, the _Fuchsia_ and _Tradescantia_, or Wandering Jew, were\r\nperfectly bland to the taste.\r\n\r\nA portion of each plant was crushed in a mortar, water or dilute\r\nalcohol was added, the mixture was stirred thoroughly and thrown upon\r\na fine sieve. By repeated washing with water and decanting a\r\nsufficient amount of the crystals was obtained for examination. From\r\nthe calla the crystals were readily secured by this means in a\r\ncomparatively pure state. In the case of the Indian turnip the\r\ncrystals were contaminated with starch, while the crystals from the\r\nfuschia and tradescantia were embedded in an insoluble mucilage from\r\nwhich it was found impossible to separate them. The crystals were all\r\nfound to be calcium oxalate.\r\n\r\nHaving determined the identity in chemical composition of the\r\ncrystals, it was thought that there might be a difference of form of\r\nthe crystals in the various plants, from the fact that calcium oxalate\r\ncrystallizes both in the tetragonal and the monoclinic systems. A\r\nlaborious microscopic examination, however, showed that this theory\r\nalso had to be abandoned. The fuchsia and tradescantia contained\r\nbundles of raphides of the same form and equally as fine as those of\r\nthe acrid plants. At this point in the investigation the writer was\r\ninclined to the opinion that the acridity of the Indian turnip and\r\ncalla was due to the presence of an acrid principle.\r\n\r\nSince the works on pharmacy claimed that the active principle of the\r\nIndian turnip was soluble in ether, the investigation was continued in\r\nthis direction. A large stem of the calla was cut into slices, and the\r\njuice expressed by means of a tincture press. The expressed juice was\r\nlimpid and filled with raphides. A portion of the juice was placed\r\ninto a cylinder and violently shaken with an equal volume of ether.\r\nWhen the ether had separated a drop was placed upon the tongue. As\r\nsoon as the effects of the ether had passed away, the same painful\r\nacridity was experienced as is produced when the plant itself is\r\ntasted. This experiment seemed to corroborate the assumption of an\r\nacrid principle soluble in ether. The supernatant ether, however, was\r\nslightly turbid in appearance, a fact which was at first ignored.\r\nWishing to learn the cause of this turbidity, a drop of the ether was\r\nallowed to evaporate on a glass slide. Under the microscope the slide\r\nwas found to be covered with a mass of raphides. A portion of the\r\nether was run through a Munktell filter. The filtered ether was clear,\r\nentirely free from raphides, and had also lost every trace of its\r\nacridity.\r\n\r\nThe same operations were repeated upon the Indian turnip with exactly\r\nsimilar results.\r\n\r\nThese experiments show conclusively that the acridity of the Indian\r\nturnip and calla is due to the raphides of calcium oxalate only.\r\n\r\nThe question of the absence of acridity in the other two plants still\r\nremained to be settled. For this purpose some recent twigs and leaves\r\nof the fuchsia were subjected to pressure in a tincture press. The\r\nexpressed juice was not limpid, but thick, mucilaginous and ropy.\r\nUnder the microscope the raphides seemed as plentiful as in the case\r\nof the two acrid plants. When diluted with water and shaken with\r\nether, there was no visible turbidity in the supernatant ether, and\r\nwhen a drop of the ether was allowed to evaporate on a glass slide,\r\nonly a few isolated crystals could be seen. From this it will be seen\r\nthat in this case the raphides did not separate from the mucilaginous\r\njuice to be held in suspension in the ether. A great deal of time and\r\nlabor were spent in endeavoring to separate the crystals completely\r\nfrom this insoluble mucilage, but without avail. With the tradescantia\r\nsimilar results were obtained.\r\n\r\nFrom these experiments the absence of acridity in these two plants, in\r\nspite of the abundance of raphides, may readily be explained by the\r\nfact that the minute crystals are surrounded with and embedded in an\r\ninsoluble mucilage, which prevents their free movement into the tongue\r\nand surface of the mouth, when portions of the plants are tasted.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the Indian turnip loses its acridity on being heated\r\ncan be explained by the production of starch paste from the abundance\r\nof starch present in the bulbs. This starch paste would evidently act\r\nin a manner similar to the insoluble mucilage of the other two plants.\r\n\r\nSo also it can readily be seen that when the bulbs of the Indian\r\nturnip have been dried, the crystals can no longer separate from the\r\nhard mass which surrounds them, and consequently can exert no irritant\r\naction when the dried bulbs are placed against the tongue.--_Jour.

It is at present still\r\nextremely rare. The Paris Museum possesses three specimens of it, and\r\nthe Boulogne Museum possesses one. These birds always excite the\r\ncuriosity of the public by their strange aspect. At first sight, says\r\nW.P. Parker, in his notes upon the osteology of the balæniceps, this\r\nbird recalls the boatbill, the heron, and the adjutant. Other birds,\r\ntoo, suggest themselves to the mind, such as the pelican, the toucan,\r\nthe hornbills, and the podarges. The curious form of the bill, in\r\nfact, explains this comparison with birds belonging to so different\r\ngroups, and the balæniceps would merit the name of boatbill equally\r\nwell with the bird so called, since its bill recalls the small fishing\r\nboats that we observe keel upward high and dry on our seashores. This\r\nbill is ten inches in length, and four inches in breadth at the base.\r\nThe upper mandible, which is strongly convex, exhibits upon its median\r\nline a slight ridge, which is quite wide at its origin, and then\r\ncontinues to decrease and becomes sensibly depressed as far as to the\r\ncenter of its length, and afterward rises on approaching the anterior\r\nextremity, where it terminates in a powerful hook, which seems to form\r\na separate part, as in the albatrosses. Throughout its whole extent,\r\nup to the beginning of the hook, this mandible presents a strong\r\nconvexity over its edge, which is turned slightly inward. The lower\r\nmandible, which is powerful, and is indented at its point to receive\r\nthe hook, has a very sharp edge, which, with that of the upper\r\nmandible, constitutes a pair of formidable shears. The color of the\r\nbill is pale yellow, passing to horn color toward the median ridge,\r\nand the whole surface is sprinkled with dark brown blotches. The\r\nnostrils are scarcely visible, and are situated in a narrow cleft at\r\nthe base of the bill, and against the median ridge. The tongue is very\r\nsmall and entirely out of proportion to the vast buccal capacity. This\r\nis a character that might assimilate the balæniceps to the pelican.\r\nThe robust head, the neck, and the throat, are covered with\r\nslate-colored feathers verging on green, and not presenting the\r\nrepulsive aspect of the naked skin of the adjutant. As in the latter,\r\nthe skin of the throat is capable of being dilated so as to form a\r\nvoluminous pouch. Upon the occiput the feathers are elongated and\r\nform a small crest. The body is robust and covered upon the back with\r\nslate-colored feathers bordered with ashen gray. Upon the breast the\r\nfeathers are lanceolate, and marked with a dark median stripe.\r\nFinally, the lower parts, abdomen, sides, and thighs, are pale gray,\r\nand the remiges and retrices are black. According to Verreaux, the\r\nfeathers of the under side of the tail are soft and decompounded, but\r\nat a distance they only recall the beautiful plumes of the adjutant.\r\nThe well-developed wings indicate a bird of lofty flight, yet of all\r\nthe bones of the limbs, anterior as well as posterior, the humerus\r\nalone is pneumatized. The strong feet terminate in four very long toes\r\ndeprived at the interdigital membrane observed in most of the\r\nCiconidæ. The claws are powerful and but slightly curved, and that of\r\nthe median toe is not pectinated as in the herons.\r\n\r\nThe balæniceps is met with only in or near water, but it prefers\r\nmarshes to rivers. It is abundant upon the banks of the Nile only\r\nduring the hot season which precedes the rains and when the entire\r\ninterior is dried up. During the rest of the year it inhabits natural\r\nponds and swamps, where the shallow water covers vast areas and\r\npresents numerous small islands, of easier access than the banks of\r\nthe Nile, which always slope more or less abruptly into deep water. In\r\nsuch localities it is met with in pairs or in flocks of a hundred or\r\nmore, seeking its food with tireless energy, or else standing\r\nimmovable upon one leg, the neck curved and the head resting upon the\r\nshoulder. When disturbed, the birds fly just above the surface of the\r\nwater and stop at a short distance. But when they are startled by the\r\nfiring of a gun, they ascend to a great height, fly around in a circle\r\nand hover for a short time, and then descend upon the loftiest trees,\r\nwhere they remain until the enemy has gone.\r\n\r\nWater turtles, fish, frogs and lizards form the basis of their food.\r\nAccording to Petherick, they do not disdain dead animals, whose\r\ncarcasses they disembowel with their powerful hooked beak. They pass\r\nthe night upon the ground, upon trees and upon high rocks. As regards\r\nnest-making and egg-laying, opinions are most contradictory. According\r\nto Verreaux, the balæniceps builds its nest of earth, vegetable\r\ndebris, reeds, grass, etc., upon large trees. The female lays two eggs\r\nsimilar to those of the adjutant. It is quite difficult to reconcile\r\nthis opinion with that of Petherick, who expresses himself as follows:\r\n\"The balæniceps lays in July and August, and chooses for that purpose\r\nthe tall reeds or grasses that border the water or some small and\r\nslightly elevated island. They dig a hole in the ground, and the\r\nfemale deposits her eggs therein. I have found as many as twelve eggs\r\nin the same nest.\"\r\n\r\nThe whale-headed stork is still so little known that there is nothing\r\nin these contradictions that ought to surprise us. Authors are no more\r\nin accord on the subject of the affinities of this strange bird. Gould\r\nclaims that it presents the closest affinities with the pelican and is\r\nthe wading type of the Pelicanidæ. Verreaux believes that its nearest\r\nrelative is the adjutant, whose ways it has, and that it represents in\r\nthis group what the boatbill represents in the heron genus. Bonaparte\r\nregards it as intermediate between the pelican and the boatbill. If we\r\nlisten to Reinhurdt, we must place it, not alongside of the boatbill,\r\nbut alongside of the African genus Scopus. The boatbill, says he, is\r\nmerely a heron provided with a singular bill, which has but little\r\nanalogy with that of the balæniceps, and not a true resemblance. The\r\nnostrils differ in form and position in those two birds, and in the\r\nboatbill there exists beneath the lower mandible a dilatable pouch\r\nthat we do not find in the balæniceps. An osteological examination\r\nleads Parker to place the balæniceps near the boatbill, and the\r\npresent classification is based upon that opinion. The family of\r\nArdeidæ is, therefore, divided into five sub-families, the three last\r\nof which each comprises a single genus.\r\n\r\nArdeidæ.--Ardeineæ (herons).\r\n          Botaurineæ (bitterns).\r\n          Scopineæ (ombrette).\r\n          Cancomineæ (boatbill).\r\n          Balænicepineæ (whale-headed stork).\r\n\r\nAll the whale-headed storks that have been received up to the present\r\nhave come from the region of the White Nile; but Mr. H. Johnston, who\r\ntraveled in Congo in 1882, asserts that he met with the bird on the\r\nRiver Cunene between Benguela and Angola, where it was even very\r\ncommon. Mr. Johnston's assertion has been confirmed by other travelers\r\nworthy of credence, but, unfortunately, the best of all confirmations\r\nis wanting, and that is a skin of this magnificent wader. We can,\r\ntherefore, only make a note of Mr. Johnston's statement, and hope that\r\nsome traveler may one day enrich our museums with some balæniceps from\r\nthese regions. The presence of this bird in the southwest of Africa\r\nis, after all, not impossible; yet there is one question that arises:\r\nWas the balæniceps observed by Mr. Johnston of the same species as\r\nthat of the White Nile, or was it a new type that will increase this\r\nfamily, which as yet comprises but one genus and one species--the\r\n_Balæniceps rex_?--_Le Naturaliste_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CALIFORNIA RAISIN INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFresno County, for ten miles about Fresno, furnishes the best example\r\nof the enormous increase in values which follows the conversion of\r\nwheat fields and grazing land into vineyards and orchards. Not even\r\nRiverside can compare with it in the rapid evolution of a great source\r\nof wealth which ten years ago was almost unknown. What has transformed\r\nFresno from a shambling, dirty resort of cowboys and wheat ranchers\r\ninto one of the prettiest cities in California is the raisin grape.\r\nThough nearly all fruits may be grown here, yet this is pre-eminently\r\nthe home of the raisin industry, and it is the raisin which in a\r\nsingle decade has converted 50,000 acres of wheat fields into\r\nvineyards. No other crop in California promises such speedy returns or\r\nsuch large profits as the raisin grape, and as the work on the\r\nvineyards is not heavy, the result has been a remarkable growth of the\r\ninfant industry. It is estimated that in this county, which contains\r\n5,000,000 acres and is nearly as large as Massachusetts, there are\r\n400,000 acres that may be irrigated and are specially adapted to the\r\ngrape. As the present crop on about 25,000 acres in full bearing is\r\nvalued at $6,000,000, some idea may be formed of the revenue that will\r\ncome to the Fresno vineyardists when all this choice valley land is\r\nplanted and in full bearing. And what makes the prospect of permanent\r\nprosperity surer is the fact that nine out of ten new settlers are\r\ncontent with twenty-acre tracts, as one of these is all which a man\r\ncan well care for, while the income from this little vineyard will\r\naverage $4,000 above all expenses, a larger income than is enjoyed by\r\nthree-quarters of the professional men throughout the country.\r\n\r\nThe raisin industry in California is very young. To be sure, dried\r\ngrapes have been known since the time of the Mission Fathers, but the\r\ndried mission grape is not a raisin. The men who thirty years ago sent\r\nover to Europe for the choicest varieties of wine grapes imported\r\namong other cuttings the Muscatel, the Muscat of Alexandria, and the\r\nFeher Zagos; the three finest raisin grapes of Spain. But the raisin,\r\nlike the fig, requires skillful treatment, and for years the\r\nCalifornia grower made no headway. He read all that had been written\r\non the curing of the raisin; several enterprising men went to Spain to\r\nstudy the subject at first hand; but despite all this no progress was\r\nmade. Finally several of the pioneer raisin men of Fresno cut loose\r\nfrom all precedent, dried their grapes in the simple and natural\r\nmanner and made a success of it. From that time, not over ten years\r\nago, the growth of the industry has eclipsed that of every other\r\nbranch of horticulture in the State, and the total value of the\r\nproduct promises soon to exceed the value of the orange crop or the\r\nyield of wine and brandy.\r\n\r\nIt required a good deal of nerve for the pioneers of Fresno County to\r\nspend hundreds of thousands of dollars in bringing water upon what the\r\nold settlers regarded as a desert, fit only to grow wheat in a very\r\nwet season. In other parts of the State the Mission Fathers had dug\r\nditches and built aqueducts, so that the settlers who came after them\r\nfound a well devised water system, which they merely followed. But in\r\nFresno no one had ever tried to grow crops by irrigation. When Fremont\r\ncame through there from the mountains he found many wild cattle\r\nfeeding on the rank grass that grew as high as the head of a man on\r\nhorseback. The herds of the native Californians were almost equally\r\nwild. The country was one vast plain which in summer glowed under a\r\nsun that was tropical in its intensity. As late as 1860 one could\r\ntravel for a day without seeing a house or any sign of habitation. The\r\ncountry was owned by great cattle growers, who seldom rode over their\r\nimmense ranches, except at the time of the annual \"round-up\" of stock.\r\nAbout thirty years ago a number of large wheat growers secured big\r\ntracts of land around Fresno. At their head was Isaac Friedlander,\r\nknown as the wheat king of the Pacific Coast. Friedlander would have\r\ntransformed this country had not financial ruin overcome him. His\r\nplace was taken by others, like Chapman, Easterby, Eisen and\r\nHughes--men who believed in fruit growing and who had the courage to\r\ncarry on their operations in the face of repeated failures.\r\n\r\nThe great development of Fresno has been due entirely to the colony\r\nsystem, which has also built up most of the flourishing cities of\r\nSouthern California. In 1874 the first Fresno colony was started by\r\nW.S. Chapman. He cut up six sections of land into 20-acre tracts, and\r\nbrought water from King's River. The colonists represented all classes\r\nof people, and though they made many disastrous experiments, with poor\r\nvarieties of grapes and fruit, still there is no instance of failure\r\nrecorded, and all who have held on to their land are now in\r\ncomfortable circumstances. Some of the settlers in this colony were\r\nSan Francisco school teachers. They obtained their 20-acre tracts for\r\n$400, and many of them retired on their little vineyards at the end of\r\nfive or six years. One lady, named Miss Austen, had the foresight to\r\nplant all her property in the best raisin grapes, and for many years\r\ndrew a larger annual revenue from the property than the whole place\r\ncost her. The central colony now has an old established look. The\r\nbroad avenues are lined with enormous trees; many of the houses are\r\nexceedingly beautiful country villas. What a transformation has been\r\nwrought here may be appreciated when it is said that 150 families now\r\nproduce $400,000 a year on the same land which twenty years ago\r\nsupported but one family, which had a return of only $35,000 from\r\nwheat. The history of this one colony of six sections of old wheat\r\nland is the key to Fresno's prosperity. It proves better than columns\r\nof argument, or facts or figures, the immense return that careful,\r\npatient cultivation may command in this home of the grape. Near this\r\ncolony are a half-dozen others which were established on the same\r\ngeneral plan. The most noteworthy is the Malaga colony, founded by\r\nG.G. Briggs, to whom belongs the credit of introducing the raisin\r\ngrape into Fresno.\r\n\r\nFresno City is the center from which one may drive in three directions\r\nand pass through mile after mile of these colonies, all showing signs\r\nof the wealth and comfort that raisin making has brought. Only toward\r\nthe west is the land still undeveloped, but another five years promise\r\nto see this great tract, stretching away for twenty miles, also laid\r\nout in small vineyards and fruit farms. Fresno is the natural railroad\r\ncenter of the great San Joaquin Valley. It is on the main line of the\r\nSouthern Pacific and is the most important shipping point between San\r\nFrancisco and Los Angeles. The new line of the Santa Fe, which has\r\nbeen surveyed from Mojave up through the valley, passes through\r\nFresno. Then there are three local lines that have the place for a\r\nterminus, notably the mountain railway, which climbs into the Sierra,\r\nand which it is expected will one day connect with the Rio Grande\r\nsystem and give a new transcontinental line. Here are also building\r\nround houses and machine shops of the Southern Pacific Company. These,\r\nwith new factories, packing houses, and other improvements, go far to\r\njustify the sanguine expectations of the residents. There has never\r\nbeen a boom in Fresno, but a high railroad official recently, in\r\nspeaking of the growth of the city, said: \"Fresno in five years will\r\nbe the second city in California.\" This prediction he based on the\r\nwonderful expansion of its resources in the last decade and the\r\nsubstantial character of all the improvements made. It is a pretty\r\ntown, with wide, well-paved streets, handsome modern business blocks,\r\nand residence avenues that would do credit to any old-settled town of\r\nthe East. The favorite shade tree is the umbrella tree, which has the\r\ngraceful, rounded form of the horse chestnut, but with so thick a\r\nfoliage that its shadow is not dappled with sunlight. Above it is an\r\nintensely dark green, while viewed from below it is the most delicate\r\nshade of pea green. Rivaling this in popularity is the pepper tree,\r\nalso an evergreen, and the magnolia, fan palm, eucalyptus, or\r\nAustralian blue gum, and the poplar. All these trees grow luxuriantly.\r\nIt has also become the custom in planting a vineyard to put a row of\r\nthe white Adriatic fig trees around the place, and to mark off ten or\r\ntwenty acre tracts in the same way. The dark green foliage of the fig\r\nis a great relief to the eye when the sun beats down on the sandy\r\nsoil. Leading out of Fresno are five driveways. The soil makes a\r\nnatural macadam, which dries in a few hours. Throughout the year these\r\nroads are in good condition for trotting, and nearly every raisin\r\ngrower is also an expert in horseflesh, and has a team that will do a\r\nmile in less than 2:30. The new race course is one of the finest in\r\nthe State. Toward the west from Fresno has recently been opened a\r\nmagnificent driveway, which promises in a few years to rival the\r\nMagnolia ave. of Riverside. This is called Chateau Fresno ave. It has\r\ntwo driveways separated by fan palms and magnolias, while along the\r\nouter borders are the same trees with other choice tropical growths,\r\nthat will one day make this avenue well worth traveling many miles to\r\nsee. This is the private enterprise of Mr. Theodore Kearney, who made\r\na fortune in real estate, and it is noteworthy as an illustration of\r\nthe large way in which the rich Californian goes about any work in\r\nwhich he takes an interest. Probably the finest avenue in Fresno is\r\nthe poplar-lined main driveway through the Barton vineyard. It is a\r\nmile in length, and the trees, fully fifty feet high, stand so thickly\r\ntogether that when in full leaf they form a solid wall of green. The\r\nvineyard, which is a mile square, is also surrounded by a single row\r\nof these superb poplars.\r\n\r\nA visit to one of the great raisin vineyards near Fresno is a\r\nrevelation in regard to the system that is necessary in handling large\r\nquantities of grapes. The largest raisin vineyard in the State, if not\r\nin the world, is that of A.B. Butler. It comprises 640 acres, of which\r\na trifle over 600 acres is planted to the best raisin grapes. Butler\r\nwas a Texas cowboy, and came to Fresno with very little capital. He\r\nsecured possession of a section of land, planted it to grapes; he read\r\neverything he could buy on raisin making, but found little in the\r\nbooks that was of any value. So he made a trip to Spain, and inspected\r\nall the processes in the Malaga district. He gathered many new ideas.\r\nOne of the most valuable suggestions was in regard to prunings and\r\nkeeping the vine free from the suckers that sap its vitality. When he\r\nreturned from this trip and passed through Los Angeles County he saw\r\nthat the strange disease which was killing many hundred acres of vines\r\nwas nothing else than the result of faulty prunings--the retention of\r\nsuckers until they gained such lusty growth that their removal proved\r\nfatal to the vine. His vineyard is as free from weeds and grass as a\r\ncorner of a well kept kitchen garden. The vine leaves have that deep\r\nglossy look which betrays perfect health. When my visit was made the\r\nwhole crop was on trays spread out in the vineyard. These trays had\r\nbeen piled up in layers of a dozen--what is technically known as\r\nboxed--as a shower had fallen the previous night, and Mr. Butler was\r\nuncertain whether he would have a crop of the choicest raisins or\r\nwhether he would have to put his dried grapes in bags, and sell them\r\nfor one-third of the top price. Fortunately the rain clouds cleared\r\naway. The crop was saved and the extreme hot weather that followed\r\nmade the second crop almost as valuable as the first.\r\n\r\nThe method of drying and packing the raisin is peculiar and well worth\r\na brief description. When the grape reaches a certain degree of\r\nripeness and develops the requisite amount of saccharine matter a\r\nlarge force is put into the vineyard and the picking begins. The\r\nbunches of ripe grapes are placed carefully on wooden trays and are\r\nleft in the field to cure. The process requires from seven days to\r\nthree weeks, according to the amount of sunshine. This climate is so\r\nentirely free from dew at night that there is no danger of must. The\r\ngrape cures perfectly in this way and makes a far sweeter raisin than\r\nwhen dried by artificial heat. When the grapes are dried sufficiently\r\nthe trays are gathered and stacked in piles about as high as a man's\r\nwaist. Then begins the tedious but necessary process of sorting into\r\nthe sweat boxes. These boxes are about eight inches deep and hold 125\r\npounds of grapes. Around the sorter are three sweat boxes for the\r\nthree grades of grapes. In each box are three layers of manila paper\r\nwhich are used at equal intervals to prevent the stems of the grapes\r\nfrom becoming entangled, thus breaking the fine large bunches when\r\nremoved. The sorter must be an expert. He takes the bunches by the\r\nstem, placing the largest and finest in the first grade box, those\r\nwhich are medium sized in the second grade, and all broken and ragged\r\nbunches in the third class. When the boxes are filled they are hauled\r\nto the brick building known as the equalizer. This is constructed so\r\nas to permit ventilation at the top, but to exclude light and air as\r\nmuch as possible from the grapes. The boxes are piled in tiers in this\r\nhouse and allowed to remain in darkness for from ten to twenty days.\r\nHere they undergo a sweating process, which diffuses moisture equally\r\nthroughout the contents of each box. This prevents some grapes from\r\nretaining undue moisture, and it also softens the stems and makes them\r\npliable.\r\n\r\nFrom the equalizing room the sweat boxes are taken to the packing\r\nroom. Here they are first weighed. The first and second grades are\r\npassed to the sorter, while the third grade raisins are placed in a\r\nbig machine that strips off the stems and grades the loose raisins in\r\nthree or four sizes. These are placed in sacks and sold as loose\r\nraisins. The higher grades are carefully sorted into first and second\r\nclass clusters. After this sorting the boxes are passed to women and\r\ngirls, who arrange the clusters neatly in small five pound boxes with\r\nmovable bottoms. These boxes are placed under slight pressure, and\r\nfour of them fill one of the regular twenty pound boxes of commerce.\r\nThe work of placing the raisins in the small boxes requires much\r\npractice, but women are found to be much swifter than men at this\r\nlabor, and, as they are paid by the box, the more skillful earn from\r\n$2 to $3 a day. It is light, pleasant work, as the room is large, cool\r\nand well ventilated, and there is no mixing of the sexes, such as may\r\nbe found in many of the San Francisco canneries. For this reason the\r\nwork attracts nice girls, and one may see many attractive faces in a\r\ntrip through a large packing house. One heavy shouldered,\r\nmasculine-looking German woman, who, however, had long, slender\r\nfingers, was pointed out as the swiftest sorter in the room. She made\r\nregularly $3 a day. The assurance of steady work of this kind for\r\nthree months draws many people to Fresno, and the regular disbursement\r\nof a large sum as wages every week goes far to explain the thrift and\r\ncomfort seen on every hand.\r\n\r\nThe five pound boxes of grapes are passed to the pressing machine,\r\nwhere four of them are deftly transferred to a twenty pound box. The\r\ntwo highest grades of raisins are the Dehesa and the London layers. It\r\nhas always been the ambition of California's raisin makers to produce\r\nthe Dehesa brand. They know that their best raisins are equal in size\r\nand quality to the best Spanish raisins, but heretofore they have\r\nfound the cost of preparing the top layer in the Spanish style very\r\ncostly, as the raisins had to be flattened out (or thumbed, as it is\r\ntechnically called) by hand. In Spain, where women work for 20 cents a\r\nday, this hand labor cuts no figure in the cost of production, but\r\nhere, with the cheapest labor at $1.50 a day, it has proved a bar to\r\ncompetition. American ingenuity, however, is likely to overcome this\r\nhandicap of high wages. T.C. White, an old raisin grower, has invented\r\na packing plate of metal, with depressions at regular intervals just\r\nthe size of a big raisin. This plate is put at the bottom of the\r\npreliminary packing box, and when the work of packing is complete the\r\nbox is reversed and the top layer, pressed into the depressions of the\r\nplate, bears every mark of the most careful hand manipulation. Mr.\r\nButler used this plate for the first time this season, and found it a\r\nsuccess, and there is no question of its general adoption. Every year\r\nsees more attention paid to the careful grading of raisins, as upon\r\nthis depends much of their marketable value. The large packing houses\r\nhave done good work in enforcing this rule, and the chief sinners who\r\nstill indulge in careless packing are small growers with poor\r\nfacilities. Probably the next few years will see a great increase in\r\nthe number and size of the packing houses which will prepare and\r\nmarket most of Fresno's raisin crop. The growers also will avail\r\nthemselves of the co-operative plan, for which the colony system\r\noffers peculiar advantages.\r\n\r\nGeometrical progression is the only thing which equals the increase of\r\nFresno's raisin product. Eighteen years ago it was less than 3,000\r\nboxes. Last year it amounted to 1,050,000 boxes, while this year the\r\nproduct cannot fall below 1,250,000 boxes. New vineyards are coming\r\ninto bearing every year, and this season has seen a larger planting of\r\nnew vineyards than ever before. This was due mainly to the stimulus\r\nand encouragement of the McKinley bill, which was worth an\r\nincalculable sum to those who are developing the raisin industry in\r\nCalifornia. Besides raisins, Fresno produced last year 2,500,000\r\ngallons of wine, a large part of which was shipped to the East. The\r\nrailroad figures show the wealth that is produced here every year from\r\nthese old wheat fields. The dried fruit crop last year was valued at\r\n$1,123,520; raisins, $1,245,768; and the total exports were\r\n$8,957,899.\r\n\r\nThe largest bearing raisin vineyard in Fresno is that of A.B. Butler,\r\nwho has over 600 acres in eight year-old vines. The pack this year\r\nwill be fully 120,000 boxes. As each box sells for an average of\r\n$1.75, the revenue from this vineyard will not fall far below a\r\nquarter of a million. One of the finest places in the county is\r\nColonel Forsythe's 160-acre vineyard, from which 40,000 boxes are\r\npacked. Forsythe has paid so much attention to the packing of his\r\nraisins that his output commands a fancy price. This year he wanted to\r\ngo to Europe, so he sold his crop on the vines to a packing house,\r\nreceiving a check for $20,000. These, of course, are the great\r\nsuccesses, but nearly every small raisin grower has made money, for it\r\ncosts not over 1½ cents per pound to produce the raisin, and the price\r\nseldom falls below 6 cents per pound. Good land can be secured in\r\nFresno at from $50 to $200 per acre. The average is $75 an acre for\r\nfirst-class raisin land that is within ten miles of any large place.\r\nIt costs $75 an acre to get a raisin vineyard into bearing. In the\r\nthird year the vines pay for cultivation, and from that time on the\r\nratio of increase is very large. Much of the work of pruning, picking,\r\nand curing grapes is light, and may be done by women and children. The\r\nonly heavy labor about the vineyard is the plowing and cultivating.\r\nFresno is a hot place in the summer, the mercury running up to 110\r\ndegrees in the shade, but this is a dry heat, which does not enervate,\r\nand, with proper protection for the head, one may work in the sun all\r\nday, without any danger of sunstroke.\r\n\r\nThe colony system, which has been brought to great perfection around\r\nFresno, permits a family of small means to secure a good home without\r\nmuch capital to start with. Where no money is paid for labor, a\r\nvineyard may be brought to productiveness with very small outlay. At\r\nthe same time there is so great a demand for labor in the large\r\nvineyards, that the man who has a five or ten acre tract may be sure\r\nof work nearly all the year. In some places special inducements have\r\nbeen held out to people of small means to secure a five-acre vineyard\r\nwhile they are at work in other business. One colony of this sort was\r\nstarted eighteen months ago near Madera, in Fresno County. A tract of\r\n3,000 acres was planted to Muscat grapes, and then sold out in five\r\nand ten acre vineyards, on five years' time, the purchaser paying only\r\none-fifth cash. The price of the land was $75 an acre, and it was\r\nestimated that an equal sum per acre would put the vineyard into full\r\nbearing. Thus, for $750, or, with interest, for $1,000, a man working\r\non a small salary in San Francisco will have in five years a vineyard\r\nwhich should yield him a yearly revenue of $500. From the present\r\noutlook there can be no danger of over-production of raisins, any more\r\nthan of California wine or dried fruits. The grower is assured of a\r\ngood market for every pound of raisins he produces, and the more care\r\nhe puts into the growing and packing of his crop, the larger his\r\nreturns will be. For those who love life in the open air, there is\r\nnothing in California with greater attractions than raisin growing in\r\nFresno County.--_N.Y. Tribune._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLD AND MORTALITY.\r\n\r\nBy Dr. B.W. RICHARDSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the seven weeks of extreme atmospheric cold in which the last\r\nyear ended and with which the present year opened, every one has been\r\nstartled by the mortality that has prevailed among the enfeebled and\r\naged population. Friends have been swept away in a manner most painful\r\nto recall, under the influence of an external agency, as natural as it\r\nis fatal in its course, and over which science, as yet, holds the most\r\nlimited control.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of these facts questions occur to the mind which have\r\nthe most practical bearing. Why should a community wake up one day\r\nwith catarrh or with the back of the throat unduly red and the tonsils\r\nlarge? Why, in a particular village or town, shall the medical men be\r\nsummoned on some particular day to a number of places to visit\r\nchildren with croup? What is the reason that cases of sudden death, by\r\nso-called \"apoplexy,\" crowd together into a few hours? Why, in a given\r\nday or week, are shoals of the aged swept away, while the young live\r\nas before? These are questions which curative and preventive medicine\r\nhave not yet mastered as might be desired. Curative medicine, at the\r\nname of them, too often stands abashed, if her interpreter be honest;\r\nand preventive medicine says, if her interpreter be honest, \"The\r\nquestions wait as yet for full interpretation.\"\r\n\r\nStill, we are not altogether ignorant; some circumstances appear to be\r\nfollowed by effects so definite, that we may almost consider we have\r\nbefore us, in true position, cause and effect. Let us look at this\r\nposition in reference to _the simple influence of temperature on the\r\nvalue of life_.\r\n\r\nIf we observe the fluctuation of the thermometer by the side of the\r\nmortality of the nation at large, no calculable relationship seems, at\r\nfirst sight, to be traceable between the one and the other. But if, in\r\nconnection with the mortality, care be taken to isolate cases, and to\r\ndivide them into groups according to the ages of those who die, a\r\nsingular and significant series of facts follow, which show that after\r\na given age a sudden decline of the temperature influences mortality\r\nby what may be considered a definite law. The law is, that variations\r\nof temperature exert no marked influence on the mortality of the\r\npopulation under the age of thirty years; but after the age of thirty\r\nis reached, a fall of temperature, sufficient to cause an increased\r\nnumber of deaths, acts in a regular manner, as it may be said, in\r\nwaves or lines of intensity, according to the ages of the people. If\r\nwe make these lines nine years long, we discover that they double in\r\neffect at each successive point. Thus, if the, fall in the temperature\r\nbe sufficient to increase the mortality at the rate of one person of\r\nthe age of thirty, the increase will run as follows: 1 death at 30\r\nyears of age will become 2 deaths at 39 years of age, 4 at 48 years, 8\r\nat 57 years, 16 at 66 years, 33 at 75 years, and 64 at 84 years.\r\n\r\nIn these calculations nothing seems to be wanting that should render\r\nthem trustworthy; they resulted from inquiries conducted on the\r\nlargest scale; they were computed by one of our greatest authorities\r\nin vital statistics, the late Dr. William Farr, and they accord with\r\nwhat we gather from common daily observation. They supply, in a word,\r\nthe scientific details and refinements of a rough estimate founded on\r\nuniversal experience, and they lead us to think very gravely on many\r\nsubjects which may not have occurred to us before, and which are as\r\ncurious as they are important.\r\n\r\nWe often hear persons who know little about vital phenomena, by which\r\nterm I mean nothing mysterious, but simply the physics embraced in\r\nthose phenomena which we connect with form and motion under the term\r\nlife, harping on the one string, that man knows nothing of the laws of\r\nlife and death. But what an answer to such presumption do the facts\r\nrendered above supply. Life and death are here reduced, on given\r\nconditions, to reasonings as clear and positive as are the reasonings\r\non the development of heat by the combustion of fuel. It is not\r\nnecessary for the vital philosopher to go out into the towns and\r\nvillages to take a new census of deaths to enable him to give us his\r\nreadings of the general mortality under the conditions specified. He\r\nmay sit in his cabinet, and, as he reads his thermometer day by day,\r\npredict results. There is a fall of temperature that shall be known by\r\nexperience to be sufficiently deep and prolonged to cause an increase\r\nof one death among those members of the community who have reached\r\nthirty years. Then, rising by a definite rule, there have died\r\nsixty-four, in proportion to that one, of those who have reached\r\neighty-four years. This is sound calculation, and it leads to\r\nreflection. It leads one to ask, what, if the law be so definite, are\r\ncurative and preventive medicine doing meanwhile, that they shall not\r\ndisturb it? I fear that they hardly produce perturbations, and I do\r\nnot see why they should; because, as the truth opens itself to the\r\nmind, the tremendous external change in the forces of the universe\r\nthat leads to the result, is not to be grappled with nor interfered\r\nwith by any specific method of human invention. The cause is too\r\ngeneral, too overwhelming, too grasping. It is like the lightning\r\nstroke in its distance from our command; but it is widely spread, not\r\npointed and concentrate; prolonged, not instantaneous; and, by virtue\r\nof these properties, is so much the more subtile and devastating.\r\n\r\nAt first it seems easy to explain the reason why a sudden fall in\r\ntemperature should lead to an increase in the number of deaths, and it\r\nis to be admitted that, to a certain extent, the reason is clear.\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMAL POWER AT DIFFERENT PERIODS OF LIFE.\r\n\r\nWithout entering on the question whether heat is the animating\r\nprinciple of all living organisms, we may accept that in the evolution\r\nof heat in the body we have a measurement of the capacity of the body\r\nto sustain motion, which is only another phrase for expressing the\r\nresistance of the body to death. For example, if we assume that a\r\nhealthy man of thirty respires sufficient air per day to produce as\r\nmuch heat as would raise fifty pounds of water at 32° Fahr. to 212°\r\nFahr., and if we assume that a man of sixty in the same temperature is\r\nonly able to respire so much air as shall cause him to evolve so much\r\nheat as would raise forty pounds of water from 32° to 212°, we see a\r\ngeneral reason why the older man should feel an effect from a sudden\r\nchange in the temperature of the air which the younger would not feel;\r\nand if we assume, further, that a man of eighty could in the same time\r\nproduce as much heat as would raise only twenty pounds of water from\r\n32° to 212°, we see a good reason why the oldest should suffer more\r\nfrom a decrease of external temperature than the other two. It is\r\nnecessary, however, to know more than this general statement of an\r\napproximate fact; we ought to understand the method by which the\r\nreduction of temperature influences, and the details of the\r\nphysiological process connected with the phenomena. When a human body\r\nis living after the age when the period of its growth is completed and\r\nbefore the period of its decay has commenced, it produces, when it is\r\nquite healthy, by its own chemical processes, so much heat or force as\r\nshall enable it, within given bounds, (1) to move its own machinery;\r\n(2) to call forth, at will, a limited measure of extra force which has\r\nbeen lying latent in its organism; and (3) to supply a fluctuating\r\nloss that must be conveyed away by contact with the surrounding air,\r\nby the earth, and by other bodies that it may touch, and which are\r\ncolder than itself. There is thus produced in the body, _applied_\r\nforce, _reserve_ force, and _waste_ force, and these distributions of\r\nthe whole force generated, when correctly applied, maintain the\r\nperfect organism in such balance that life is true and steady. So much\r\nactive force carries with it the power to perform so much labor; so\r\nmuch reserve force carries with it the power to perform a measure of\r\nnew or extra labor to meet emergencies; so much waste force enables\r\nthe body to resist the external vicissitudes without trenching on the\r\nsupply that is always wanted to keep the heart pulsating, the chest\r\nbreathing, the glands secreting or excreting, the digestive apparatus\r\nmoving, and the brain thinking or absorbing.\r\n\r\nLet us, even in the prime of manhood, disturb the distribution of\r\nforce ever so little, and straightway our life, which is the resultant\r\nof force, is disturbed. If we use the active force too long, we become\r\nexhausted, and call on the reserve; if we continue the process, the\r\nresult is failure more or less perfect, sleep, and, in the end, the\r\nlast long sleep. Let us, instead of exhausting the force, cut it off\r\nat the sources where it is generated; let us remove the carbon or coal\r\nthat should go in as fuel food, and we create prostration, and in\r\ncontinuance a waning animal fire, sleep, and death; or let us, instead\r\nof removing or withdrawing the supply of fuel, cut off the supply of\r\nair, as by immersion of the body in water, or by making it breathe a\r\nvapor that weakens the combination of oxygen with carbon--such a vapor\r\nas chloroform--and again we produce, at once, prostration, sleep, or\r\ndeath, according to the extent to which we have conducted the process.\r\nLastly, if instead of using up unduly the active and reserve force, or\r\nof suppressing the evolution of force by the withdrawal of its\r\nsources, we expose the body to such an external temperature that it is\r\nrobbed of its heat faster than it can generate it; if to supply the\r\nwaste heat we draw upon the active and reserve forces, we call forth\r\nimmediately the same condition as would follow extreme over-exertion,\r\nor suppression of the development of force; we call forth exhaustion\r\nand sleep, and, if we go far enough, death.\r\n\r\nWe have had in view, in the above description, a man in the prime of\r\nlife, in the center of growth, and decay. In regard to the force of\r\nanimation in him, let us look at him now retrospectively and\r\nprospectively. In the past his has been a growing, developing body,\r\nand in the course of development he has produced an excess of force\r\ncommensurate with the demands of his growth; this has enabled him\r\ngradually to bear more fatigue and more exposure, without exhaustion,\r\nand even with ease, until he has reached his maximum. When he has\r\nstopped in development, when he stands on a fair level with the\r\nexternal forces that are opposed to him, then his own force, for a\r\nshort time balanced, soon stands second in command. He feels cold more\r\ntenderly; if his rest be broken, the demand for artificial heat is\r\nmore urgent; if he lose or miss food, he sinks quickly; and, returning\r\nto our facts, as to the influence of the external temperature on\r\nmortality, these are the reasons why a fall in the thermometer sweeps\r\naway our population according to age so ruthlessly and decisively.\r\n\r\nIf we analyze the facts further by the side of the diseases which kill\r\nthe old, we find those diseases to be numerous in name, but all of two\r\ntypes. They are diseases which of themselves tend either to produce\r\nundue loss of force, or that tend to prevent the development of force\r\nat its origin. Thus affections which are accompanied with exhaustive\r\nloss of fluids from the body, such as diabetes, dropsies, and\r\nhæmorrhages, are of the first class; affections in which due supply of\r\nair to the lungs is prevented are of the second class, especially\r\nbronchitis, a disease so commonly assigned as the cause of the deaths\r\namong the members of the aged and enfeebled population, that succeed\r\nimmediately on an extreme fall of the thermometer.\r\n\r\n\r\nFALL OF TEMPERATURE--MODE OF ACTION.\r\n\r\nIn what has been written above I have stated simply and in open terms\r\nthe fact that the fall of temperature produces a specified series of\r\nresults, by reducing the force of the living organism, and disposing\r\nit to die. We may from this point investigate, from a physiological\r\npoint of view, the mode by which the effect is produced in the\r\neconomy. How does the decline of temperature act? Is the process\r\nsimple or compound?\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACTION OF HEAT.\r\n\r\nThe process is compound, and into it there enter three elements. In\r\nthe first place, the body is robbed rapidly of its waste force, and\r\nthe reserve and active elements of force are, consequently, called\r\nupon to the depression of the organism altogether. This obtains\r\nbecause the medium surrounding the body, the air, unless it be\r\nartificially heated, removes from its contact with the body a larger\r\nproportion of heat than can be spared; and it might be possible to\r\nproduce such an influence on the body by sudden extraction of its heat\r\nas to destroy it at once by the mere act. If a man could be surrounded\r\nwith frozen mercury he would die instantaneously, as from shock, by\r\nthe immediate extraction of his heat. But in ordinary cases, and under\r\nordinary circumstances, the mere rapid extraction of waste heat is not\r\nsufficient to account for all the mischief produced by a low\r\ntemperature; for by artificial warmth and non-conducting garments, we\r\ncounteract the influence, and that, too, in a manner which proves\r\npretty successful. We may, therefore, leave this element of extraction\r\nof heat as a most important, but not as the sole, agent of evil.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPRESSED OXIDATION.\r\n\r\nThe second element is the effect on the process of oxidation of blood\r\nunder the influence of cold. We all are aware that if a portion of\r\ndead animal or vegetable matter be placed at a low temperature, it\r\nkeeps for a considerable time; and we have evidence of dead animals\r\nwhich, clothed in thick ribbed ice, have been retained from\r\nputrefaction for centuries. Hence we say that cold is an antiseptic as\r\nalcohol is, and chloroform, and ammonia, and other similar bodies.\r\nCold is an antiseptic then, but why? Because it prevents, even in the\r\npresence of a ferment, the union of oxygen gas with combustible\r\nmatter. The molecules of oxygen, in order that they shall combine, and\r\nin their combination evolve heat, require to be distributed, and to be\r\ndistributed by the form of motion known as heat; deprive them of this\r\nactivity, and they come into communion with themselves, are attracted\r\nto each other, and lose to the extent of this attraction their power\r\nof combining with the molecules of other bodies for which they have an\r\naffinity. In an analogous, but more obvious way, we may see the same\r\neffect of motion in the microscopic examination of blood. In the\r\nblood, while it is circulating briskly in its vessels, there are\r\ndistributed through it, without contact with each other, the millions\r\nof oxygen carriers called blood corpuscles. In the circulation in the\r\nfree channels of the body, the arteries and veins, it is motion that\r\nkeeps these corpuscles apart; we draw a drop of blood and let it come\r\nto rest on the microscope glass, and as the motion ceases the\r\nseparated corpuscles run together, and adhere so firmly that we cannot\r\neasily separate them without their disintegration. If we were able to\r\ndrive them in this state round the body, through the vessels, they\r\nwould not combine readily with the tissues; they have, in fact,\r\nforfeited the condition necessary for such combination. So with the\r\noxygen they carry; when its invisible molecules are deprived of the\r\nforce called heat, which is motion, they do not readily combine with\r\nnew matter. But perfect combination of oxygen and carbon in the blood\r\nis essential to every act of life. In the constant clash of molecule\r\nof oxygen with molecule of carbon in the blood lies the mainspring of\r\nall animal motion; the motion of the heart itself is secondary to\r\nthat. Destroy that union, however slightly, and the balance is lost,\r\nand the animal body is, in a plain word, _ill_.\r\n\r\nCold or decreased temperature, below a given standard, which for sake\r\nof comparison we may take at a mean of 40° Fahr., reduces this\r\ncombination of oxygen and carbon in blood. In my Lettsomian lectures\r\nto the Medical Society of London, delivered in 1860, I entered very\r\nfully into this subject, and illustrated points of it largely by\r\nexperiment. Since then I have done more, and although I have not time\r\nhere to state the details of these researches, I will epitomize the\r\nprincipal facts. I found then that, by exposing blood in chambers into\r\nwhich air can pass in and out, the blood could be oxidized at\r\ntemperatures of 70° if the distribution of air and blood were\r\neffectually secured, and I also found a proper standard of oxidation\r\nfrom a proper temperature. Afterward I proceeded to test for\r\ncombination at lower temperatures, and discovered a gradually\r\ndecreasing scale until I arrived at 40° Fahr., when efficient\r\ncombination ceased. Of course, my method was a very crude imitation of\r\nnature, but it was sufficient to show this fair and reliable result,\r\nthat the oxidation of blood decreases as the temperature of the oxygen\r\ndecreases.\r\n\r\nFrom this point I went to animal life itself. I exposed animals to\r\npure cold oxygen and to cold atmospheric air, and compared the results\r\nwith other experiments in which animals of similar weight were exposed\r\nto warm air and warm oxygen. The facts gleaned were most important,\r\nfor they proved conclusively that the products of combustion, that is\r\nto say, the products resulting from the union of oxygen and carbon,\r\nwere reduced in proportion as the temperature of the oxygen was\r\nreduced. In the course of this inquiry another singular and\r\ninstructive fact was elicited. It has been long known that at ordinary\r\ntemperature, say 60°, pure neutral oxygen does not support animal life\r\nso well as oxygen that is diluted with nitrogen. In the nitrogen the\r\nmolecules of oxygen are more freely distributed under the influence of\r\nmotion, that is the meaning of the observed fact. What, then, would be\r\nthe respective influence of low and high temperatures on the\r\nrespiration of pure oxygen? To settle this question, animals of the\r\nsame size and weight were placed in equal measures of oxygen gas and\r\ncommon air at a temperature of 30° Fahr., and with the inevitable\r\nresult that the animal in the pure oxygen ceased to respire one-third\r\nsooner than did the animal in common air. Carrying the inquiry\r\nfurther, I found that if the oxygen gas were warmed to 50° Fahr., the\r\nrespiration was continued six times as long as in the previous\r\nexperiment, while if the warming were carried to 70°, it was sustained\r\ntwenty-four times as long. I reversed the experiment; I made oxygen\r\nwith cold produce anæsthetic sleep in a warm-blooded animal.\r\n\r\nI need not carry this argument further; it is the easiest of the\r\ndemonstrative facts of physiological science that reduction of\r\ntemperature lessens the combining power of oxygen for blood, and\r\ntherewith causes a reduction of animal force, and a tendency to arrest\r\nof that force, which, in the end, means _death_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL COLD.\r\n\r\nThe third element in the action of cold is more purely mechanical, and\r\nthis, though in a sense secondary, is of immense import. When any\r\nbody, capable of expansion by heat, that is to say, by radiant motion\r\nof its own particles, is reduced in temperature, it loses volume,\r\ncontracts, or shrinks. The animal body is no exception to this rule; a\r\nring that will fit tightly to the warm finger will fall off the same\r\nfinger after exposure to cold. The whole of the soft parts shrink, and\r\nthe vessels contract and empty themselves of their blood. Cold applied\r\nto the skin in an extreme degree blanches the skin, and renders it\r\ninsensible and bloodless, so that if you prick it it does not bleed,\r\nneither does it feel. In cases where the body altogether is exposed to\r\nextreme cold this shrinking of the external parts is universal; the\r\nwhole surface becomes pale and insensible; the blood in the small\r\nvessels superficially placed is forced inward upon the heart and\r\nvessels of the interior organs; the brain is oppressed with blood;\r\nsleep, or coma, as it is technically called, follows, and at last life\r\nis suspended.\r\n\r\nIn exposure to the lowest wave of temperature in this country these\r\nextreme effects are not commonly developed; but minor effects are\r\nbrought out which are most significant. In particular, the effect on\r\nthe lungs is strongly marked. The capillary vessels of the lungs,\r\nmaking up that fine network which plays over the computed six hundred\r\nmillions of air vesicles, undergo paralysis when the cold air enters,\r\nand in proportion as such obstruction from this cause is decisive, the\r\nblood that should be brought to the air vesicles is impeded, and the\r\nprocess of oxidation is mechanically as well as chemically suppressed.\r\nThe same contraction is also exerted on the vessels of the skin,\r\ndriving the blood into the interior and better protected organs. Hence\r\nthe reason why on leaving a warm room to enter a cold frosty air there\r\nis an immediate action of the visceral organs from pressure of blood\r\non them, and not unfrequently a tendency to diarrhoea from temporary\r\ncongestion of the digestive tract. Three factors are at work, in fact,\r\nwhenever the low wave of temperature affects the animal body;\r\nabstraction of heat from the body, beyond what is natural; arrest of\r\nchemical action and of combustion; paralysis of the minute vessels\r\nexposed to the cold.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMBINED EFFECTS.\r\n\r\nWe cannot view the extent of change in the organic life induced by the\r\nlow wave of heat without seeing at once the sweep of mischief which\r\nexposure to the wave may effect. It exerts an influence on healthy\r\nlife in the middle-aged man, and I know of no disease which it does\r\nnot influence disastrously. Is the healthy man exhausted, it favors\r\ninternal congestion; has he a weak point in the vascular system of his\r\nbrain, it renders that point liable to pressure and rupture, with\r\napoplexy as the sequence; is he suffering from bronchial disease, and\r\nobstruction, already, in his air passages, here is a means by which\r\nthe evils are doubled; has he a feeble, worn-out heart, it is unable\r\nto bear the pressure that is put upon it; has he partial obstruction\r\nof the kidney circulation, he is threatened with complete obstruction;\r\nis he indifferently fed, he is weakened generally. It is from this\r\nextent of action that the mortality of all diseases runs up so fast\r\nwhen the low wave of heat rolls over the population, affecting, as we\r\nhave seen, the feeblest first.\r\n\r\nAnother danger sometimes follows which is remote, but may be fatal,\r\neven to persons who are in health. It is one of the best known facts\r\nin science that when a part of the surface of the body has been\r\nexposed long to cold, the greatest risk is run in trying suddenly to\r\nwarm it. The vessels become rapidly dilated, their coats relax, and\r\nextreme congestion follows. But what is true of the skin is true\r\nequally, and with more practical force, of the lungs. A man, a little\r\nbelow par, goes out when the wave of temperature is low, and feels\r\noppressed, cold, weak, and miserable; the circulation through his\r\nlungs has been suppressed, and he is not duly oxidizing; he returns to\r\na warm place, he rushes to the fire, breathes eagerly and long the\r\nheated air, and adds to the warmth by taking perchance a cup of\r\nstimulant; then he goes to bed and wakes in a few hours with what is\r\ncalled pneumonia, or with bronchitis, or with both diseases. What has\r\nhappened? The simple physical fact of reaction under too sudden an\r\nexposure to heat after exposure to cold. The capillaries of the lungs\r\nhave become engorged, and the circulation static, so that there must\r\nbe reaction of heat, inflammation, before recovery can occur. Nearly\r\nall bronchial affections are induced in this manner, not always nor\r\nnecessarily in the acute form, but more frequently by slow degrees, by\r\nrepetition and repetition of the evil. Colds are often taken in this\r\nsame way, from the exposed mucous surfaces of the nose and throat\r\nbeing subjected first to a chill, then to heat.\r\n\r\nThe wave of low temperature affecting a mixed population finds\r\ninevitably a certain number of persons of all ages and conditions on\r\nwhom to exert its power. It catches them too often when they least\r\nexpect it. An aged man, with sluggish heart, goes to bed and reclines\r\nto sleep in a temperature, say, of 50° or 55°. In his sleep, were it\r\nquite uninfluenced from without, his heart and his breathing would\r\nnaturally decline. Gradually, as the night advances, the low wave of\r\nheat steals over the sleeper, and the air he was breathing at 55°\r\nfalls and falls to 40°, or it may be to 35° or 30°. What may naturally\r\nfollow less than a deeper sleep? Is it not natural that the sleep so\r\nprofound shall stop the laboring heart? Certainly. The great narcotic\r\nnever travels without fastening on some victims in this wise, removing\r\nthem, imperceptibly to themselves, into sleep ending in absolute\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME SIMPLE RULES.\r\n\r\nThe study of the physiological influence of the wave of low\r\ntemperature, and of its relation to the wave of mortality, suggests a\r\nfew rules, simple, and easily remembered.\r\n\r\n1. Clothing is the first thing to attend to. To have the body, during\r\nvariable weather, such as now obtains, well enveloped from head to\r\nfoot in non-conducting substance is essential. Who neglects this\r\nprecaution is guilty of a grievous error, and who helps the poor to\r\nclothe effectively does more for them than can readily be conceived\r\nwithout careful attention to the subject we have discussed.\r\n\r\n2. In sitting-rooms and in bedrooms it is equally essential to\r\nmaintain an equable temperature; a fire in a bedroom is of first value\r\nat this season. The fire sustains the external warmth, encourages\r\nventilation, and gives health not less than comfort.\r\n\r\n3. In going from a warm into a cold atmosphere, in breasting the wave\r\nof low temperature, no one can harm by starting forth thoroughly warm.\r\nBut in returning from the cold into the warm the act should always be\r\naccomplished gradually. This important rule may readily be carried in\r\nmind by connecting it with the fact that the only safe mode of curing\r\na frozen part is to rub it with ice, so as to restore the temperature\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\n4. The wave of low temperature requires to be met by good, nutritious,\r\nwarm food. Heat-forming foods, such as bread, sugar, butter, oatmeal\r\nporridge, and potatoes, are of special use now. It would be against\r\nscience and instinct alike to omit such foods when the body requires\r\nheat.\r\n\r\n5. It is an entire mistake to suppose that the wave of cold is\r\nneutralized in any sense by the use of alcoholics. When a glass of hot\r\nbrandy and water warms the cold man, the credit belongs to the hot\r\nwater, and any discredit that may follow to the brandy. So far from\r\nalcohol checking the cold in action, it goes with it, and therewith\r\naids in arresting the motion of the heart in the living animal,\r\nbecause it reduces oxidation.\r\n\r\n6. Excessive exercise of the body, and overwork either of body or of\r\nmind, should be avoided, especially during those seasons when a sudden\r\nfall of temperature is of frequent occurrence. For exhaustion, whether\r\nphysical or mental, means loss of motion in the organism; and loss of\r\nmotion is the same as loss of heat.\r\n\r\nOne further consideration, suggested by the subject of this paper, has\r\nreference to the bearing of the public toward the labors of the\r\nmedical man in meeting the effects of the low wave of heat. The\r\npublic, looking on the doctor as a sort of mystical high priest who\r\nought to save, may often be dissatisfied with his work. Let the\r\ndissatisfied think of what is meant by saving when there is a sudden\r\nfall in the thermometer. Let them recall that it is not bronchitis as\r\na cause of death, nor apoplexy, nor heart disease, as such, that the\r\ndoctor is called on to meet; but an all-pervading influence which\r\noverwhelms like the sea, and against which, in the mass, individual\r\neffort stands paralyzed and helpless. When the doctor is summoned the\r\nmischief has at least commenced, and, it may be, is so far over that\r\ntreatment by mere medicines sinks into secondary significance. Then\r\nhe, true minister of health, candid enough to bow humbly before the\r\ngreat and inevitable truth, and professing no specific cure by nostrum\r\nor symbol, can only try to avert further danger by teaching elementary\r\nprinciples, and by making the unlearned the participators in his own\r\nlearning.--_The Asclepiad._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TREATMENT OF GLAUCOMA.\r\n\r\nAs this disease is so fatal to vision, any remedy that may be\r\nsuggested to diminish the frequency of its termination in blindness\r\ncannot fail to be read of with interest. M. Nicati, in the _Revue\r\ngenerate de clinique et de therapeutique_, has had marked success in\r\nthe treatment of glaucoma by drainage of the posterior chamber, either\r\nby sclerotomy or by sclero-iritomy, as the conditions of the\r\nindividual case may require.--_N.Y.

She is 42 ft. keel and 7 ft. beam, and has 4\r\nft. depth of hold. She has an improved Clarke compound engine, also\r\nshown in an accompanying illustration, with a high pressure piston\r\nfour inches in diameter, and a low pressure piston eight inches in\r\ndiameter, the stroke being six inches, and the engine driving two\r\ntwenty-six inch screws. With 130 pounds of steam, and making 275\r\nrevolutions per minute, the launch attains a speed of nine miles per\r\nhour, thus fully demonstrating the adaptability of this engine to the\r\nsuccessful working of twin screws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CLARKE COMPOUND TWIN-SCREW OPERATING ENGINE.]\r\n\r\nIn the Clarke engine, the exhaust pipe from the high pressure cylinder\r\nleads to the steam chest of the low pressure cylinder, while the\r\npiston in the upper cylinder is secured on a piston rod extending\r\ndownward and connected with a piston operating in the lower cylinder,\r\nthe exhaust pipe from the latter leading to the outside. On the piston\r\nrod common to both cylinders is secured a crosshead pivotally\r\nconnected by two pitmen with opposite crank arms on crank shafts\r\nmounted to turn in suitable bearings on the base, which also supports\r\na frame carrying the low pressure cylinder, on top of which is a frame\r\nsupporting the high pressure cylinder. The valves in the two steam\r\nchests are connected with each other by a valve rod connected at its\r\nlower end in the usual manner with the reversing link, operated from\r\neccentrics secured on one of the crank shafts.\r\n\r\nThe crank arms stand at angles to each other, so that the crank shafts\r\nare turned in opposite directions, and the position of the link is\r\nsuch that it can be readily changed by the reversing lever to\r\nsimultaneously reverse the motion of the crank shafts. On the crank\r\nshafts are also formed two other crank arms pivotally connected by\r\nopposite pitmen with a slide mounted in vertical guideways, supported\r\non a frame erected on the base, the motion of the crank shafts causing\r\nthe vertical sliding motion of the slide traveling loosely in the\r\nguideways, and thus serving as a governor, as, in case one of the\r\npropellers becomes disabled, the power of the shaft carrying the\r\ndisabled propeller is directly transferred to the other shaft through\r\nthe crank arms, pitmen, and slide, and the other propeller is caused\r\nto do all the work. All the parts of the engine are within easy reach\r\nof the engineer, and there are so few working parts in motion that the\r\nfriction is reduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the plan of construction and the operation of this\r\nengine have been carefully observed by practical engineers, and that,\r\nconsidering the dimensions of the boat, her speed, the smallness of\r\nthe power, the ease with which she passes the centers, the absence of\r\nvibration while running, and the very few working parts in motion, the\r\nengine is a notable success. She can be run at a very high velocity\r\nwithout injury or risk, and is designed to be very economical in cost\r\nand in weight and space. This engine has been recently patented in the\r\nUnited States and foreign countries by Mr. James A. Clarke, of New\r\nWestminster.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENTS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF RIVER AND CANAL BARGES.\r\n\r\nBy M. RITTER (KNIGHT) VON SZABEL, late Austrian Naval Officer, of\r\nVienna.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis innovation consists essentially in an arrangement by which two\r\ndistinct vessels, on being revolved round their longitudinal axis to\r\nan angle of 90°, can be combined into one single duplex vessel, or, to\r\nput it in different words, a larger vessel is arranged so that it can\r\nbe parted into two halves (called \"semi-barges\"), which can be used\r\nand navigated with equal facility as two distinct vessels, as if\r\ncombined into one. By the combination of the two semi-barges into one\r\nduplex barge the draught of the vessel is nearly doubled, the ratio\r\nexisting between the draught of a loaded semi-vessel and the equally\r\nloaded duplex vessels being 5:8 (up to 8.5)\r\n\r\nThe advantage of the invention consists:\r\n\r\n    1. In this difference of draught.\r\n\r\n    2. In the smaller width of the semi-vessel as compared with\r\n    the duplex vessel.\r\n\r\n    3. In the fact that the combination and separation of the\r\n    vessels can be effected, without the least disturbance of the\r\n    cargo, in a minimum of time.\r\n\r\nIt facilitates the utilization, to the highest possible extent, of the\r\nvarying conditions and dimensions of canal locks and rivers.\r\n\r\nThe transition from rivers to canals, and from larger canals to\r\nsmaller ones, is expedited by the possibility afforded of, on the\r\narrival at the locks, dividing the vessel in a space of a few minutes;\r\nof passing with the semi-vessel, singly, the various smaller locks or\r\nthe shallow canal, after which the two sections may be re-combined and\r\nnavigated again as one vessel. The process of \"folding up\" the two\r\nvessels will of course take longer than that of separation.\r\n\r\nOn rivers, the channels of which are interrupted by sand banks and\r\nrapids, the same operation may be carried out, thus avoiding the\r\nexpense and delay necessitated by, perhaps, repeated \"lightering,\"\r\ni.e., reduction of the cargo.\r\n\r\nThus, the through traffic on large rivers like the Danube, with its\r\nrepeated obstacles to navigation, such as the \"iron gate,\" and several\r\nsand-banks known and dreaded by bargemen, would be materially\r\nfacilitated, any necessity for unloading part of the cargo being\r\nobviated; moreover, such a duplex vessel composed of two semi-vessels\r\naffords the advantage of utilizing to a fuller degree the power of\r\ntraction, and one large vessel will be more convenient for traffic\r\nthan two smaller ones.\r\n\r\nFurther, the mode of construction of the semi-vessels--both ends of\r\nwhich are of a similar pattern--allows of their being navigated up and\r\ndown a water channel without the necessity of turning them round;\r\nprovision having also been made for the fixing of the rudder at either\r\nend, which would therefore merely require exchanging. This is of some\r\nadvantage in narrow river beds and canals, and applies equally to the\r\nduplex vessel as to the single semi-vessels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nEach semi-barge on its part is also constructed of two equal\r\nhalves--which are, however, inseparable--and as there is no distinct\r\nstem or stern, any one of these semi-vessels will fit any other\r\nsemi-vessels of the same dimensions, and can be attached to the same\r\nby means of the coupling apparatus, and the two \"folded up\" into one\r\nduplex vessel. This process does not present any material\r\ndifficulties. The two single boats on being coupled together can be\r\nmade to lean over toward each other, by filling their lateral water\r\ncompartments, to such an extent that the further closing up can be\r\neasily effected by means of specially constructed windlasses. In the\r\ncase of petroleum vessels the \"folding up\" operation is facilitated by\r\nthe circumstance that the petroleum may be made to serve the purposes\r\nof water ballast.\r\n\r\nAs regards the size and tonnage of the new vessels, this will of\r\ncourse depend on the local condition of the rivers and canals to be\r\nnavigated. Thus a vessel destined for traffic on canals with locks of\r\nvarying dimensions will have to be adapted to the dimensions of the\r\nsmallest existing lock.\r\n\r\nSupposing the size of the latter to be such as found in the case of\r\nthe Rhine-Marne or the Rhine-Rhone Canal, or on the Neckar down to\r\nCannstadt, or in the Danube-Main Canal and some smaller canals in the\r\nWeser district, etc., viz.:\r\n\r\n    Length of lock     34.5 meters.\r\n    Width               5.2   \"\r\n    Depth               1.6 to 2.0 meters.\r\n\r\nThe semi-barge may be made 32 meters in length, 4 meters in breadth\r\nand 2.5 meters total depth, and with a draught of 1.5 meters will be\r\ncapable of carrying a load of 100 tons (of 1,000 kilos each).\r\nCorrespondingly the duplex vessel will be able to carry 200 tons, with\r\na minimum draught of 2.4 meters and a width of 5.4 meters, but, with a\r\nfavorable height of the water level, the draught of the semi-barge may\r\nbe increased to 1.65 and that of duplex vessels to 2.7 meters.\r\n\r\nWhere not limited to certain proportions by the dimensions of the\r\nlocks to be passed, the vessel may in the first place be made longer;\r\nthe width and height may also be increased accordingly (provided that\r\nthe proportion of breadth to width is kept within the ratio 4:2.5), so\r\nthat the semi-barges may be constructed for a single burden up to 300\r\ntons, or 600 for the duplex vessel.\r\n\r\nAs regards the nature of the cargo, parcels would not be admissible in\r\nthis instance, but any kind of homogeneous cargo would be suitable\r\nwhich would bear laying over on one side.\r\n\r\nThus this style of vessel would be well adapted for petroleum tank\r\nvessels, for the transport of all kinds of cereals, flour, coffee, and\r\nsugar in sacks--these latter being held in position by an arrangement\r\nof planking and boards so as to prevent any overturning of the goods\r\non the vessels being folded up or taken apart. Similarly in the case\r\nof a cargo of loose grain or other loose produce, the same must be\r\nprevented from being upset by a kind of wooden casing.\r\n\r\nTwo semi-vessels loaded with different cargoes may be coupled\r\ntogether, provided that there is not too much difference between their\r\nrespective draughts. Slight differences may be balanced by the water\r\ncompartments being filled to a greater or smaller extent.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar position of the hatches allows of loading the\r\nsemi-vessels separately as well as when coupled together.\r\n\r\nIf there is for the time being no necessity for using the vessels in\r\ntheir capacity of separate and duplex barges, any kind of cargo might\r\nbe loaded that does not require large hatches.\r\n\r\nThe vessels, on account of their more complicated construction, will\r\nbe somewhat more expensive, but wherever the advantage offered by them\r\noutweighs the extra expenditure, they can be used with success.\r\n\r\nThe innovation might be of particular importance where a new canal\r\nsystem is being constructed, since the latter might be subdivided into\r\nmain canals and branch canals--similarly as in the case of ordinary\r\nand narrow gauge railways--the main canal being built of a larger\r\nsection and with larger locks to suit the duplex barges, while the\r\nbranch canals could be planned of smaller dimensions calculated to\r\nsuit the semi-barge. Thus the first cost of such a canal system would\r\nbe materially reduced as compared with a canal installation of one\r\nuniform section throughout.\r\n\r\nLikewise in mountainous districts with rock soil it would be an\r\nimportant consideration whether a canal had to be blasted out of the\r\nsolid rock or a tunnel cut, in dimensions suitable for a vessel of 6\r\nor of 14 square meters section below the water line.\r\n\r\nIn this case, even in certain portions of a main canal--where rendered\r\ndesirable by the rocky nature of the ground--a smaller section might\r\nbe adopted, which would only be large enough for single semi-barges,\r\nso that the duplex vessel would in these instances have to be taken\r\napart in the same way as in a branch canal.\r\n\r\nThe saving to be effected by constructing a canal on this principle,\r\nas compared with a canal of one uniform section throughout, must be\r\nconsiderable, and the advantages of the arrangement are apparent.\r\n\r\nThe appended figures will further illustrate the arrangement. Fig. 1\r\nshows two separate semi-barges ready to pursue their journey\r\nindependently. Fig. 2 shows two semi-barges coupled together ready to\r\nbe \"folded up\" by means of ropes and specially constructed\r\nwindlasses--their lateral water compartments having previously been\r\nfilled. Fig. 3 shows the duplex vessel after the \"folding up\"\r\noperation just described; and Figs. 4 and 5 show the cross section of\r\ntwo loaded semi-barges as outlined in Figs. 2 and 3.\r\n\r\nThese Figs. 4 and 5 will also serve to illustrate the manner in which\r\nsacks and loose produce should be loaded. Fig. 4 also shows the filled\r\nwater compartments, and the effect of their weight in making the boats\r\nlean toward each other.\r\n\r\nThe materials most suited for this new style of vessel will be iron\r\nand steel such as generally used in the construction of canal and\r\nriver vessels.\r\n\r\nThe new ship can be moved by any motor or driving implement, nor could\r\nthere technically a great difficulty be found for making the boilers\r\nmove on a quadrant-like rail base in the shape of a circle segment's\r\nquarter, or for building a double screw steamer by combining two\r\nsingle screw propellers.\r\n\r\nMay be a ship owner is willing to submit the innovations to an\r\nattempt, so much the more as there is running no great risk by doing\r\nso; for in case the ships should not answer the expectations, both\r\nseparable as well as joinable, they can be used like single ships,\r\nwithout any further alteration being made, except as to the loading\r\ngaps.\r\n\r\nThe above invention is covered by United States patent No. 435,107.\r\nAny further information may be had by addressing M. v. Szabel, ix\r\nBezirk, Beethovengasse 10, Wien, Austria.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWELDON'S RANGE FINDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Weldon has recently considerably modified and improved his\r\ningenious range finder, and we illustrate herewith from _Engineering_\r\nthe form in which it is now manufactured. It consists of a metal box,\r\nthe lid of which is shown open in the engraving, and on this lid are\r\nfitted three prisms which are the essential constituents of the\r\ninstrument. When the lid is closed, these, with the compass and level,\r\nalso attached to the lid, lie inside the metal box, and are thus\r\nthoroughly protected. The upper prism marked 1 is a right-angled one\r\nand is mounted with the right angle outward; looking into the\r\nleft-hand corner of this prism one will see in it, by double\r\nreflection, objects lying on one's right hand. Below this is a second\r\nprism with a principal angle of 88 deg. 51 min. 15 sec., and below\r\nthis a third with a principal angle of 74 deg. 53 min. 15 sec.\r\n\r\nA level and a compass are also mounted on the lid as shown. To use the\r\ninstrument the observer stands so that the object the range of which\r\nis required lies on his right hand, and looking into the left-hand\r\ncorner of the upper prism views it there by double reflection from the\r\ninternal faces of the prism. At the same time looking through the\r\nopening shown in the lid below the prism he selects some object, which\r\nappears nearly in line with the image seen in the prism. He then\r\nshifts his position till these two images coincide, in which case\r\nlines joining him with the two objects will make right angles with\r\neach other. In Fig. 2, O is the object whose range is required, D the\r\nobject seen by direct vision, and A the position of the observer. The\r\nobserver now marks his position on the ground, and shifting the\r\ninstrument looks into the left-hand corner of the second prism, when\r\nhe again sees the image of the object, whose range is required, by\r\ndouble reflection, but lying now to the right of the object, D. He\r\nthen retires, keeping in line with A and D, till he reaches B, when\r\nthe two images again coincide; the lines joining them and the observer\r\nnow make an angle of 88 deg. 51 min. 15 sec. Then in the triangle,\r\nOBA, OA = tan 88 deg. 51 min. 15 sec. X A B = 50 AB. The length AB is\r\neasily paced, and the distance OA is 50 times this length.\r\n\r\nA longer base, and probably greater accuracy, can be obtained by using\r\nthe second prism only, as indicated in Fig. 3, in which case the\r\ndistance of the object is 25 times the distance BC. This second prism\r\nis, however, best adapted for predicting the range of moving objects.\r\nThree observers are required. Two of them have finders, while the\r\nother measures the distance between the two. The first two observers\r\nseparate, and No. 2 takes a position such that the object is reflected\r\nto one side of observer No. 1, whom he views by direct vision. As the\r\nobject continues to move, its image gets nearer and nearer No. 1, who\r\nduring the whole of the time moves a little to one side or the other,\r\nso as to keep the image of the object constantly in line with No. 2.\r\nJust as the image of the object gets very near No. 1, No. 2 calls out\r\n\"Ready,\" the distance between the two observers is taken by the third,\r\nand when the image of the object actually falls on No. 1 its distance\r\nis just 25 times the distance between them, and the guns set to this\r\nrange are fired by word of command from No. 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. & FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nBy using the third prism in conjunction with the second a still longer\r\nbase of one-fourth the distance of the object can be employed. The\r\nrange finder can also be used as a depleidoscope for transit\r\nobservations. For this purpose it is mounted on a block of wood by\r\nmeans of elastic band and leveled by the level on its lid, being at\r\nthe same time set in the meridian of the place. The lid is opened to\r\nmake an angle with the horizon equal to the latitude of the place of\r\nobservation. On looking into the upper prism two images of the sun\r\nwill be seen on each side of the apex of the prism, which gradually\r\napproach each other as the sun nears the meridian, and finally\r\ncoincide as it passes it, the time of which being noted gives the\r\nlongitude of the place.\r\n\r\nExtensive trials of the instrument have been made both in this country\r\nand in India, which agree in showing that the average error in using\r\nthe instrument is about 2½ to 3½ per cent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEELS LINKED WITH A BELL CRANK.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1]\r\n\r\nThere are four ways in which a connecting rod is made use of in\r\nmachine work. The first is in linking two wheels together that stand\r\nin the same position, but a slight distance off centers. The rod in\r\nthis case has only to lead the driven wheel around by connecting it\r\nwith the driver, and consequently has only to endure a pulling strain\r\nin the direction of its length. The second is when the rod is called\r\nupon to stand a pull and a push at every revolution. The third takes\r\nin the matter of the twisting strain that a rod can manage; but the\r\nfourth brings the hardest usage that a connecting rod can be called\r\nupon to endure, and that is by making a lever of the rod to get a\r\ndriving action by prying on a fulcrum in the center. In Fig. 1 is seen\r\na case of this kind taken from a machine in which a disk engine was\r\nmade use of. The rod has a chance to turn about on its center from a\r\nball and socket joint, and engages with both wheels in nicely fitted\r\njournals, and boxes set in line with the center of the socket joint,\r\nso that when one wheel turns, the rod pries the other around by using\r\nthe rod as a lever and the ball joint for a fulcrum, giving a uniform\r\nleverage all the while, with no dead centers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nTo set this arrangement around at right angles, or where the shafts\r\nwill bring the wheels together, as for bevel gears, a bent lever arm\r\nwould need to be used, as shown in Fig. 2, but the bend in the\r\nconnecting arms brings in another feature that must be provided, as it\r\nallows the wheels to turn either with or against each other, and\r\nleaves two places where the bent arms will come to a dead center. What\r\nis needed here is another element that will take all the twisting\r\nstrain on the rod and keep the pitch of both arms alike in every\r\nportion of a revolution. To do this the ball and socket joint will\r\nneed to be replaced by a gambrel joint like a ship's compass, and\r\narranging the bent driving arms as shown in Fig. 3; then the driving\r\nend of the connecting frame will move about in a true circle,\r\nproducing as great a tendency to turn the driving wheel in one\r\nposition as another. In this arrangement there must be at least six\r\nnicely fitted journals and their bearings, four of which will be\r\nrequired to take care of the forked connecting rod that joins the\r\nwheels together. Besides all this the bearings must all line up with\r\nthe same center that the shafts are centered from or there will be a\r\n\"pinch\" somewhere in the system. It may seem at first that there must\r\nbe more or less end-on movement provided for, and that the bearings\r\nshould be spherical; but that it is not the case will be noticed when\r\nall the points are understood to be working from one center similar to\r\nthat provided for in bevel gears.--_Boston Journal of Commerce._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DECORATIVE TREATMENT OF NATURAL FOLIAGE.[1]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: Lectures before the Society of Arts, London, 1891.]\r\n\r\nBy HUGH STANNUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lecture I._\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1.--THE ELEMENTS OF DECORATION.\r\n\r\nThe chief impelling Motives which have caused that treatment of\r\nobjects which is now termed _Decorative_, have been:\r\n\r\n    (a) That necessitated by the Usage, which is FUNCTIONAL;\r\n\r\n    (b) That resulting from the Instinct to please the eye, which\r\n    is ÆSTHETIC;\r\n\r\n    (c) That arising from the Desire to record or to teach, which\r\n    is the DIDACTIC motive;\r\n\r\nThe ÆSTHETIC instinct of the early peoples was gratified by:\r\n\r\n    (a) The _forms_ of their weapons or tools;\r\n\r\n    (b) The _patterns_ with which they are decorated;\r\n\r\n    (c) The _imitation_ of the surrounding animals, e.g. the Deer\r\n    scratched on the horn at the British Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\nImitation was afterward applied to the vegetable creation; and much of\r\nwhat is termed Ornament was derived from that class of elements.\r\n\r\nThe ELEMENTS OF DECORATION are the material used by the Artist. They\r\nmight be considered to include everything that is visible; but since\r\nDecoration is a result of the æsthetic instinct, the field is narrowed\r\nto such as are pleasing _at the first glance_. And the selection is\r\nfurther limited to such as are suitable to the shape and size of\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nThey may be classified according to their relative Dignity, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n   The Human form,\r\n   Animal forms,\r\n   Natural foliage,\r\n   Artificial objects,\r\n   Artificial foliage, and\r\n   Geometrical figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2.--THE TWO KINDS OF FOLIAGE.\r\n\r\nA Distinction is made between natural and artificial foliage. They\r\nhave much in common; and consequently many have supposed that our\r\nWestern artificial foliage is merely a very-much-conventionalized\r\nversion of natural foliage. The supposition is correct with regard to\r\nEastern Pattern work, but not in Western Architectural ornamentation.\r\n\r\nA simple generalization may make this clear. The ordinary stock\r\nfoliage of the Ornamentist was evolved in connection with:\r\n\r\n  (In the West)         (In the East)\r\n  ARCHITECTURE,          TEXTILES,\r\n  as in Greece.          as in Persia.\r\n\r\nHence the primary Elements of decoration were derived from:\r\n\r\n  (In the West)                     (In the East)\r\n  GEOMETRICAL LINES,                NATURAL FLOWERS and LEAVES,\r\n  e.g. the meander, spiral, etc.    e.g. the pine, pomegranate, etc.\r\n\r\nFurther, it may be observed that the Method of treating these Elements\r\nhas been different:\r\n\r\n  (In the West)                        (In the East)\r\n  The Geometrical lines                The natural foliage was\r\n  were enriched by the introduction    codified by the introduction\r\n  of the details of                    of Geometrical arrangement;\r\n  Natural vegetation; thus             thus becoming\r\n  becoming gradually more              gradually more\r\n  _naturalesque_.                      _artificial_.\r\n\r\nAn APPROXIMATION between the two treatments, sometimes appears; but\r\nthe two kinds--Artificial, and Natural--are essentially different in\r\norigin; and should be kept distinct in their application.\r\n\r\nThis approximation may be shown, in a tabular arrangement, thus:\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOMETRY...........................................................NATURE\r\n\r\nThe patterns are merely                         The plants are copied as\r\n straight lines, dots, and                     accurately as possible.\r\n  portions of circles.\r\n\r\n   The lines become stems.                   The plant is applied\r\n                                            without repetition.\r\n\r\n      Leaves are added to the             Repetition is used with the\r\n       stems.                            plants.\r\n\r\n        Serration is added to the       Weaving economy induces\r\n         leaf-edge.                    symmetry.\r\n\r\n         Similarity of serrated       Symmetry induces Geometrical\r\n         leaf-edge to the Akanthos    Severity, and the Omission\r\n         plant, is observed;          of all details of the\r\n         Imitation becomes more       original plant which are not\r\n         direct; and this artificial  easily worked in connection\r\n         foliage becomes termed       with geometrical\r\n         \"Acanthus.\"                  arrangement.\r\n\r\n         Flowers generally circular   The Flowers and Leaves\r\n         in mass-shape, are added     (_only_) survive; the growth\r\n         at the ends of the spiral    of the stems is forgotten;\r\n         stems.                       and tradition does the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3.--APPLICATION OF THE TWO KINDS.\r\n\r\nEach of these two kinds of foliage has its own proper use. Artificial\r\nfoliage is appropriate to the enrichment of Architecture; and Natural\r\nfoliage to those objects which are not architectural, but are termed\r\n\"movables,\" including under this term, Furniture, and more especially\r\nHangings and other applications of the Textile art.\r\n\r\nThis may be seen on comparing the two columns below, of which the L.H.\r\none refers to Architecture, and the R.H. one to Natural foliage.\r\n\r\n  (Architecture)                       (Natural foliage)\r\n                         RULES:\r\n  Governed by severe                   Exhibits _apparent_ playful\r\n  rules of Repetition,                 Freedom. There _are_\r\n  Axiality, Symmetry, etc.,            underlying Rules, which\r\n  which are apparent to                are detected by the scientific\r\n  the passer-by. Hence                 Botanist; but these\r\n  Artificial foliage, being            are not seen by the casual\r\n  regular in its structure,            observer.\r\n  is more appropriate than\r\n  the (apparently) irregular\r\n  growth of Natural\r\n  foliage.\r\n                       CHARACTERISTICS:\r\n  Rigidity and Stability.              Elasticity and Tremulousness\r\n                                       in every breeze.\r\n\r\n                     LINES OF COMPOSITION:\r\n  Geometrical lines.                   In determinate curves,\r\n  The geometrical lines                which are very subtile,\r\n  and spirals of Artificial            and varied, and therefore\r\n  foliage demand an unmoving           suitable to a hanging and\r\n  surface for proper view.             swaying material.\r\n\r\n                                       The curves of Nature\r\n  They would generally be  spoiled     are not spoiled when on a\r\n  if not on a plane surface.           folded material.\r\n\r\n                       DISTRIBUTION:\r\n  Symmetrical. The                     Balanced. The growth\r\n  symmetry of artificial               of natural foliage is generally\r\n  foliage is appropriate to            symmetrical; but\r\n  that of Architecture.                this is not apparent.\r\n\r\n                          BEAUTY:\r\n  Depends on _form_, with              More appropriate to objects\r\n  color as a secondary adjunct.        which depend on _color_ for\r\n                                       their principal charm.\r\n\r\nThere have been waves of the desire to introduce Natural foliage into\r\nArchitecture (e.g. in the \"Decorated period\" of Gothic architecture);\r\nbut the Artificial elements have always proved too strong, and the two\r\nhave never mixed. In Architecture, everything has three dimensions;\r\nand the artificial foliage is carved with leaves, etc., of a suitable\r\nthickness: in Natural foliage the tenuity of leaves, etc., is such\r\nthat it cannot be reproduced. Even in the architraves round the\r\nglorious doors of Florence the natural foliage is not always a\r\nsuccess; and where Ghiberti has stopped short in the ductile bronze,\r\nit is not probable that the modern carver will succeed in stone. It\r\nmay therefore be suggested that the close imitation of Natural foliage\r\nshould be confined to objects of _two_ dimensions, i.e., to plane\r\nsurfaces and figured materials.\r\n\r\nThis selection of the Elements of Decoration, according to their\r\nassociation, is analogous to the selection made use of by the Poet,\r\nfrom the words and ideas, which are his Materials. It will be observed\r\nthat, as on a Classic or Heroic subject, the choice is of learned\r\nwords and classical ideas, and on a Domestic or Pastoral one, simple\r\nwords and homely similes are used--so, in conjunction with the severe\r\nforms of Architecture, the formal character of artificial foliage is\r\nsuitable; and for decorating Textiles and other movable Accessories,\r\nthe Natural foliage, with which the earth is clothed and beautified,\r\nis appropriate.\r\n\r\nENRICHMENT OF SURFACE may be beautiful for one reason; IMITATION OF\r\nNATURE is beautiful for another. When imitations of natural foliage\r\nare introduced decoratively on a surface, then may it be twice\r\nbeautiful--first, in the _principles_ according to which the\r\ndistribution is arranged; and secondly, because of the _elements_\r\nwhich are worked in being beautiful in themselves. Geometrical\r\nelements might be so used as to serve the first end, but can never\r\nfulfill the second: Storiation fulfills the second; but its increase\r\nof interest absorbs the first.\r\n\r\nThis course of Lectures is intended to treat of Natural foliage,\r\nleaving Artificial foliage to be dealt with at another opportunity. It\r\nis not Historical. The History of the Decorative treatment of Natural\r\nfoliage, showing its evolution in the past, is a large and interesting\r\ntheme; but, unless this were accompanied by critical remarks based on\r\ngiven principles, the method might be barren of results. Tradition is\r\nnot to be undervalued; but the student should be led to Tradition\r\nthrough Principles.\r\n\r\nIt is further intended more especially to apply to the æsthetic use.\r\nWhen natural foliage is used Æsthetically (i.e., decoratively), then\r\nthe Shape of the surface should govern the Mass shape of the foliage,\r\nand there should be Parallelism between them (see § 29). When used\r\nDidactically (i.e., symbolically), then the foliage may be treated\r\nmore freely.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4.--THE FOUR TREATMENTS.\r\n\r\nThere are, broadly speaking, four methods of treating Natural foliage.\r\nThese may be arranged in a Chart, according to their relation to the\r\ntwo poles of Art and Science; from Realism (which is all Art and no\r\nScience) to the \"Botanical Analysis\" method (in which is a little\r\nScience but no Art), thus:\r\n\r\nThe first two of these methods are Artistic and legitimate: the others\r\nare inartistic and misleading. Before treating of the artistic methods\r\nit will be well to clear the ground by dismissing the others.\r\n\r\n  ART POLE..........................................SCIENCE POLE\r\n\r\n      Realism   | Conventionalism |   Disguised   | Botanical\r\n    (See § 10). |  (See § 14).    | Artificialism |  Analysis\r\n                |                 |  (See § 6).   | (See § 5).\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5.--THE BOTANICAL ANALYSIS TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nIn this method the student was taught (i) to draw each plant with the\r\nStem _straightened out_, the Leaves _flattened out_, and the Flowers\r\nrepresented as in _side elevation_ or _plan_. (ii) The Flowers were\r\nfurther _pulled in pieces_, and the Petals were _flattened out_ in a\r\nmanner similar to the Entomologists' practice of displaying their\r\n\"specimens\" scientifically. Often, also (iii) the Stems and Buds were\r\n_cut through_; and \"patterns\" were made with the Sections.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the first of these practices (i): it should be observed\r\nthat much of the beauty of appearance of natural foliage results from\r\nthe variety of view, the subtile curvature, and the foreshortening, as\r\nseen in perspective; and that to sacrifice all these for the sake of a\r\n_diagram_ would be a wasted opportunity.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the other practices (ii) and (iii): it is obvious that\r\nthese statements of the facts of the plant are useful as a part of the\r\nScience of Botany; but can no more be considered as making Decoration\r\nthan Anatomical diagrams can be looked upon as Pictures. Some\r\nknowledge of external Botany is useful to a Pattern artist as some\r\nknowledge of external Anatomy is useful to the Pictorial artist. In\r\neach of these cases, the Science, which discovers and records facts,\r\nis subservient to its sister, Art, which uses the facts to interpret\r\nappearances; and, when scientific diagrams are put forth as Art, the\r\nScience is in its wrong place: it has then been treated as if it were\r\nthe Building instead of being only the Scaffolding; and the results of\r\nsuch attempts cannot be considered as complete or final.\r\n\r\nExamples of this method are given in Figs. 1 and 2. It was officially\r\nencouraged about twenty-five years ago; and books like \"Plants, their\r\nNatural Growth and Ornamental Treatment,\" and \"Suggestions in Floral\r\nDesign,\" both by F. Edward Hulme, F.L.S., etc., show it at its best.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nIn criticising this method, there is no desire to cast any slight upon\r\nthose who were responsible for it. They were groping in the dark, and\r\ndid the best they knew, according to their lights. But Japanese work\r\nwas not known at that time, and, but for that, the Pattern artist of\r\nto-day might still be occupied in pinning leaves and flowers against\r\nthe wall. It was, moreover, a protest against the Cabbage Rose on the\r\nHearth rug, that some may still remember with shuddering.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6.--THE DISGUISED ARTIFICIALITY TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nIn this method the student was taught to sketch out what he considered\r\nto be good Curves and Spirals; and then (i) to bend the selected plant\r\nso that its stem might coincide with them, regardless of its own\r\nproper natural growth; or (ii) to deck out the first drawn spirals\r\nwith the leaves and flowers of the selected plant.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the first of these practices: it is much more foolish\r\nthan the Analysis method; and is little short of blasphemy against the\r\nGreat Designer. He has determined how each plant shall grow: how,\r\nwithin limits of cultivation, its stems and branches shall separate,\r\neach to seek its own share of air and sunshine; how its leaves shall\r\nstand erect or droop, each according to its function; and always in\r\nperfect beauty. And further: how each family of plants shall have its\r\nown method of branching; which is as much a part of its character and\r\noften of its beauty as are the Flowers and Leaves.\r\n\r\nThe second practice, which generally produces a result similar to the\r\nfirst, is quite as unthinking. It is more often practiced; and is\r\nresponsible for many of the labored and uninteresting designs which\r\nare common. If the Pattern-artist deck-out the old worn-out and common\r\nplace spirals with leaves and flowers borrowed from Nature--the result\r\nis like the \"voice of Jacob and the hands of Esau;\" it is merely a\r\nDisguise of Artificiality.\r\n\r\nAn example of this method is given in Fig. 3. It was generally\r\npracticed in Germany; and books like \"Das Vegetabile Ornamente,\" by K.\r\nKrumbholz, show it at its best.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nIf this treatment were universally followed--there would soon be an\r\nend to design with natural foliage. The spectator might observe one\r\nborder which appeared to be a Rose, another a Tulip, the third a\r\nThistle, and the fourth a Fuchsia; and, on examination, discover that\r\nthese were not Rose, Tulip, Thistle, and Fuchsia; but merely that very\r\nartificial old friend--the Spiral-scroll--_in disguise_.\r\n\r\nAn apologist for this method remarks:--\" ... In such matters as the\r\nramification of plants, ... nature is always making angles and elbows\r\n[_sic_] which we are obliged, in decorative treatment, to change into\r\ncurves for our purpose;...\". This opinion needs only to be applied to\r\nanimals in order to exhibit its absurdity; and with regard to plants,\r\nit will be seen that this tampering has not even the poor merit of\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7.--NOTE ON SYMMETRY.\r\n\r\nA desire for Symmetry often accompanies these two treatments. This is\r\na quality to be avoided whenever possible in Natural foliage design.\r\nThe so-called \"Turn-over patterns\" are an economy in Weaving-design,\r\nbut the economy is of the wrong kind. An artist should spend his\r\nthought to spare material or cost in working. When he spares his\r\n_thought_--making the least amount of thought cover the greatest\r\namount of surface--then is his work worth to the world just what it\r\nhas cost him, i.e., very little.\r\n\r\nSo injurious is the influence of Symmetry in Natural foliage design,\r\nthat it might almost be a test question--\"Is the design symmetrical?\"\r\nWhen the exigencies of Machine-reproduction necessitate this with\r\nNatural foliage--it is a hardship which the Artist regretfully accepts,\r\nand no one would willingly make a design for Hand-reproduction which\r\nwas symmetrical; rather would he spend himself to insure the worthier\r\nresult which ensues from Balance.\r\n\r\nAn example of Symmetry is given in Fig. 4; and of Balance in Fig. 5.\r\nEach panel contains two classes of Elements:--Natural foliage (i.e.,\r\ntwo branches of the Bay tree), and an Artificial object (i.e., a\r\nRibbon which ties them). The lower Element (i.e., the Ribbon) is\r\ntreated symmetrically in both panels: the higher Element (i.e., the\r\nBranches) are _symmetrical_ in the former panel, and _balanced_ in the\r\nlatter. This latter treatment, will be seen to be not only the more\r\ninteresting, but the more like the infinite variety of Nature; while\r\nthe former is a wasted opportunity, and contrary to Nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nThe Student will observe by experience that the mind soon tires of\r\nArtificiality, both in Curvature and in Symmetry; the lines of Nature\r\nhave a pleasant freshness and inexhaustible variety; and the _Natural_\r\nmethod of treating Nature is not only the most true, but also the most\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 8.--REALISM AND CONVENTIONALISM: DEFINITIONS.\r\n\r\nREALISM--the result of _Realistic_ treatment, i.e., the attempt to\r\nrender the reproduction as like the reality as is possible, even to\r\nthe verge of deception--is the aim of the Pictorial-Artist. In\r\nPictures the surface appears to have been annihilated, and the\r\nspectator beholds the scene as if there were a hole through the wall.\r\nIt is not the highest, and should not be the only aim in Art; but it\r\nhas always been sought for and admired. It requires perfect\r\nconditions, of materials and tools; i.e., _complete Technical\r\nappliances_.\r\n\r\nCONVENTIONALISM--the result of _incomplete Technical appliances_, and\r\nthe attempt to render so much of the Beauty of the original as is\r\npossible, with due regard to their capabilities--is the aim of the\r\nDecorative-Artist. It is not the highest aim; though a necessary curb\r\nin Decorative-Art, both for the technical reason, and also as a result\r\nof the Position or Function of the object.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that the two words, when used with regard to\r\nfoliage of any kind, refer to the _Method of representing it_, and not\r\nto its Kind or its manner of Growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 9.--SCALES FROM REALISM TO CONVENTIONALISM.\r\n\r\nThese two methods, when applied absolutely, form the two\r\nextremes:--The most complete REALISM being at one end, and the most\r\nlimited CONVENTIONALISM at the other. There are scales of gradual\r\nreduction between them, which may be shown on two charts:\r\n\r\n(i) Reduction in the NUMBER OF PARTS which preserve their Realistic\r\nrendering.\r\n\r\n(ii) Reduction in the DEGREE OF REALISM through all parts.\r\n\r\n(i) According to the number of the features or parts of the design\r\nwhich are treated with less than realism. Thus there might be a panel\r\nrepresenting a Window-opening with an architectural framing, with a\r\nFlower-vase on the sill, and a Landscape-background. The first part to\r\nbe reduced in realistic rendering would be the Background, the second\r\nwould be the Framing, leaving the third, the Flower-vase, as the\r\nsurvival. This is a Scale of reduction in _Number of Parts_.\r\n\r\nIt may be shown, in tabular arrangement, thus:--\r\n\r\n  REALISM............................................CONVENTIONALISM.\r\n\r\n\r\n    COMPLETE PICTORIAL REALISM, in which all parts are realistically\r\n    represented (see § 10).\r\n\r\n      SEMI-PICTORIAL REALISM, in which the Back-ground is reduced to\r\n      a flat-tint, while all the remaining parts are realistically\r\n      represented (see § 11).\r\n\r\n        DECORATIVE REALISM, in which the chief Feature (_only_)\r\n        is realistically represented, and all the other parts are\r\n        reduced to conventional renderings (see § 12).\r\n\r\n          COMPLETE CONVENTIONALISM, in which all parts are reduced to\r\n          conventional renderings (see Conventionalism).\r\n\r\nInasmuch as there is some realistic part remaining in each of the\r\nfirst three methods--these are classified under the heading of\r\nREALISM.\r\n\r\n(ii) According to the Degree in which color, gradation, or shading, is\r\nsacrificed, in consequence of the limited Means at the disposal of the\r\nArtist; resulting in the gradual departure from Realism to the most\r\nsevere Conventionalism. The reduction is applied to all parts of the\r\nwork. This is a scale of reduction in _Degree_. There are two\r\nVarieties in each degree; and they are marked with italic letters.\r\n\r\nIt may be shown, in tabular arrangement, thus:--\r\n\r\n  REALISM.............................................CONVENTIONALISM.\r\n\r\n  COMPLETE REALISM, in which all parts are represented, in\r\n  proper colors, and perfect gradation, with correct light and\r\n  shade (see § 10).\r\n\r\n    FIRST DEGREE OF CONVENTIONALISM, in which all parts are\r\n    represented: (a) By a reduced number of Pigments, the other\r\n    qualities remaining; (b) By reduction in gradation and\r\n    shading to Flat-tints of several pigments (see § 15).\r\n\r\n      SECOND DEGREE OF CONVENTIONALISM, in which all parts are\r\n      represented: (c) By a reduction to Monochrome of color, with\r\n      Gradation (_only_) remaining; (d) By reduction to Monochrome\r\n      of White and Black, with Gradation (_only_) remaining (see §\r\n      16).\r\n\r\n        THIRD DEGREE OF CONVENTIONALISM, in which all parts are\r\n        represented: (e) By reduction to a Flat-tint of one pigment\r\n        on a ground of another; (f) By reduction to a Flat-tint of\r\n        White on Black, or _vice versa_ (see § 17).\r\n\r\n          ULTIMATE CONVENTIONALISM, in which all parts are\r\n          represented; (g) By reduction to Outline of several\r\n          pigments; (h) Reduction to Outline of one pigment (see §18).\r\n\r\n\r\nInasmuch as Realism ceases so soon as any reduction in the three\r\nqualities (of color, gradation, and shadow) is introduced; and the\r\ntreatment becomes more Conventional in each method after the\r\nfirst--these are classified under the heading of CONVENTIONALISM.\r\n\r\n[There is an analogous scale of reduction in Form, from the\r\nComplete-relief of an isolated Statue to the Flatness of a\r\nFloor-plate; but this does not belong to the present subject.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CYCLOSTAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe various processes commonly employed for the observation of bodies\r\nin motion (intermittent light or vision) greatly fatigue the observer,\r\nand, as a general thing, give only images, that are difficult to\r\nexamine. We are going to show how Prof. Marc Thury, upon making\r\nresearches in a new direction, has succeeded in constructing an\r\napparatus that permits of the continuous observation of a body having\r\na rapid rotary motion. The principle of the method is of extreme\r\nsimplicity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 1, 2, AND 3.--DIAGRAMS EXPLANATORY OF THE\r\nPRINCIPLE OF THE CYCLOSTAT.]\r\n\r\nLet us consider (Fig. 1) a mirror, A B, reflecting an object, C D, and\r\nrevolving around it: when the mirror will have made a half revolution,\r\nthe image, C' D', of the object will have made an entire one. The\r\nfigure represents three successive positions of the mirror, distant by\r\nan eighth of a revolution. The structure of the image shows that it\r\nhas made a quarter revolution in an opposite direction in each of its\r\npositions. But if (Fig. 2) the body itself has revolved in the same\r\ndirection with an angular velocity double that of the mirror, its\r\nimage will have described a circle in remaining constantly parallel\r\nwith itself. The image will be just as insensible as the object\r\nitself; but it is very easy to bring it back to a state of rest.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose (Fig. 3a) the observer placed at O, the revolving\r\nobject at T, the axis of rotation being this time the line O F. Let us\r\nplace a mirror at A B and cause it to revolve around the same axis;\r\nbut, instead of looking at the image directly in the mirror, let us\r\nreceive it, before and after its reflection upon A B, upon two\r\nmirrors, C D and D E, inclined 30° upon the axis of rotation of the\r\nsystem; the image, instead of being observed directly in the mirror, A\r\nB, will always be seen in the axis, O F, and will consequently appear\r\nimmovable.\r\n\r\nThe same result may be obtained (Fig. 3b) with a rectangular isosceles\r\nprism whose face, A B, serves as a mirror, while the faces, A C and B\r\nD, break the ray--the first deflecting it from the axis to throw it on\r\nthe mirror, and the second throwing it back to the axis of rotation,\r\nwhich is at the same time the line of direction of the sight.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the instrument, then, consists in causing the\r\nrevolution, around the axis of rotation of the object to be observed,\r\nof a mirror parallel with such axis, and in observing it in the axis\r\nitself after sending the image to it by two reflections or two\r\nrefractions. In reality, the entire instrument is contained in the\r\nsmall prism above, properly mounted upon a wheel that may be revolved\r\nat will; and, in this form, it may serve, for example, to determine\r\nthe rotary velocity of an inaccessible axis. For this it will suffice\r\nto modify its velocity until the axis appears to be at rest, and to\r\napply the revolution counter to the wheel upon which the prism is\r\nmounted, or to another wheel controlling the mechanism.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Thury has constructed a completer apparatus, the _cyclostat_\r\n(Fig. 4), which, opposite the prism, has a second plate whose\r\nactuating wheel is mounted upon the same axis as the first, the\r\ngearing being so calculated that the prism shall revolve with twice\r\nless velocity than the second plate. This latter, observed through the\r\nprism, will be always seen at rest, and be able to serve as a support\r\nfor the object that it is desired to examine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--THE CYCLOSTAT.\r\n\r\n1. General view of the apparatus.\r\n2. Section of the ocular, O.]\r\n\r\nThe applications are multitudinous. In the first place, in certain\r\ndifficult cases, it may serve for the observation of a swinging\r\nthermometer, which is then read during its motion. Then it may be\r\nemployed for the continuous observation of a body submitted to\r\ncentrifugal force. Apropos of this, we desire to add a few words. Most\r\nof the forces at our disposal, applied to a body, are transmitted from\r\nmolecule to molecule, and produce tension, crushing, etc. Gravity and\r\nmagnetic attraction form an exception; their point of application is\r\nfound in all the molecules of the body, and they produce pressures and\r\nslidings of a peculiar kind. But these forces are of a very limited\r\nmagnitude; but it might nevertheless be of great interest to amplify\r\nthem in a strong measure. Let us, for example, suppose that a magician\r\nhas found a means of increasing the intensity of gravity tenfold in\r\nhis laboratory. All the conditions of life would be modified to the\r\nextent of being unrecognizable. A living being borne in this space\r\nwould remain small and squat. All objects would be stocky and be\r\nspread out in width or else be shattered. Viscid or semi-solid bodies,\r\nsuch as pitch, would rapidly spread out and take on a surface as\r\nplane and smooth as water under the conditions of gravity upon the\r\nearth. On still further increasing the gravity, we would see the soft\r\nmetals behaving in the same way, and lead, copper and silver would in\r\nturn flow away. These metals, in fact, are perfectly moulded under a\r\nstrong pressure, just like liquids, through the simple effect of the\r\nattraction of the earth applied to all their molecules. Upon causing\r\nan adequate attractive force to act upon the molecules of metals they\r\nwill be placed under conditions analogous to those to which they are\r\nsubmitted in strong presses or in the mills that serve for coining\r\nmoney. The sole difference consists in the fact that the action of\r\ngravity is infinitely more regular, and purer, from a physical\r\nstandpoint, than that of the press or coining mill. Through very\r\nsimple considerations, we thus reach the principle which was\r\nenunciated, we believe, by the illustrious Stokes, that our idea of\r\nsolid and liquid bodies is a necessary consequence of the intensity of\r\ngravity upon the earth. Upon a larger or smaller planet, a certain\r\nnumber of solid bodies would pass to a liquid state, or inversely. Let\r\nus return to the cyclostat. In default of gravity, centrifugal force\r\ngives us a means of realizing certain conditions that we would find in\r\nthe laboratory of our magician. The cyclostat permits us to observe\r\nwhat is going on in that laboratory without submitting ourselves to\r\nforces that might cause us great annoyance. We have hitherto been\r\ncontent to put poor frogs therein and study upon them the effect of\r\nthe central anæmia and peripheral congestion produced on their\r\norganism by the unrestrained motion of the liquids carried along by\r\ncentrifugal force. The results, it seems, have proved very\r\ncurious.--_La Nature_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCURY WEIGHING MACHINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe illustrate herewith a novel type of weighing machine. Hitherto the\r\nweighing machines in common use have either been designed with some\r\nkind of steelyard apparatus, upon which weights could be moved to\r\ndifferent distances from a fixed fulcrum, or springs have been so\r\napplied as to be compressed to different degrees by different weights\r\nput upon the scale pan, or table, of the machine. In other instances\r\nmore complicated mechanism is used, and various movable counterpoises\r\nare usually required in order to balance the moving parts of the\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe type of machine which we now illustrate has been recently brought\r\nout by Mr. G.E. Rutter, and the system has given very satisfactory\r\nresults with platform weighing machines. The engraving illustrates a\r\nform of balance which may be applied to strength testing machines, or\r\nfor any work where an apparatus of the type of a Salter's balance\r\nwould be of use. It is simple in construction, and consists of a tube\r\nA closed at the bottom and forming a reservoir for mercury. The body\r\nwhich it is required to weigh is hung upon the hook B carried by the\r\ncrossbar C, which is connected by rigid rods to the upper part of the\r\ntube, and by means of the internal rods D is attached to the cross\r\nhead E, which works freely inside the tube A. The top part of the tube\r\nis, as will be clearly understood from the illustration, cut away to\r\nallow of the descent of the rods. To the cross head E is attached the\r\npiston F, which may be made of wood or of a hollow metal tube closed\r\nat the end, or other suitable material. It will be easily understood\r\nthat when a weight is hung upon the hook B, the piston F is caused to\r\ndescend into the mercury which rises in the annular space between the\r\npiston and the tube. The weight of the volume of displaced mercury is\r\nproportional to the weight of the body hung upon the hook, and the\r\nbuoyancy of the piston in the mercury forms the upward force which\r\nbalances the downward pull of gravity. When the apparatus is at rest\r\nthe piston F descends into the mercury to such a distance as will\r\nbalance the weight of the rods, hook, and piston itself. If, now, the\r\ncross bar G, provided with a pointer H, be fixed to the rods, it\r\nshould at that time register zero, upon the scale J fixed to the\r\noutside of the tube, and as the descent of the piston into the mercury\r\nis directly proportional to the weight of the body attached to the\r\nhook B, the divisions of the scale will all be equal. It will thus be\r\nseen that the apparatus is extremely simple in theory, and it only\r\nremains to construct it in such a form that the mercury may not easily\r\nbe spilt in moving the instrument from place to place. This is\r\neffected by causing the cross head E to fill the tube while working\r\nfreely therein, and a small valve is arranged to allow for the passage\r\nof air. The cross bar G can be regulated upon the rods by means of set\r\nscrews.--_Industries._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREEFING SAILS FROM THE DECK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this method may be applied to topsails and top-gallant-sails, I\r\nespecially apply it to courses, which, being so difficult to reef the\r\nold way, may by this method be reefed from the deck in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nAfter several years of trial by myself and others, on voyages around\r\nCape Horn under all circumstances of weather, of sleet and snow, this\r\nmethod has always given the utmost satisfaction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REEFING SAILS FROM THE DECK. Front View. Rear View.]\r\n\r\nThe average time required for reefing and setting was noted for five\r\nyears, being seven and one-half minutes.\r\n\r\nThis trial was made on a mainsail, the yard being seventy-one feet\r\nlong, and reefyard sixty-six feet long, eleven inches diameter at\r\ncenter and nine at yard-arms.\r\n\r\nBy reference to the drawing it will be seen that it is not necessary\r\nto have clewgarnets or buntlines in reefing. The operation is\r\nperformed by easing of the sheet and hauling the lee reef-tackle\r\nfirst, also the midship reef tackle.\r\n\r\nWhen the yardarm of the reefspar is up at the lee side, the sail\r\ncannot sag to leeward when the tack is eased away. Now haul the\r\nweather reef-tackle likewise midship, snug up to the yard, belay all\r\ndown the tack, and sheet aft.\r\n\r\nAs all the reef-tackles lead to the slings of the yard, there is no\r\nimpediment in swinging the yard when the reef-tackles are taut and\r\nbelayed.\r\n\r\nThe slack sail will not chafe, as it remains quiet, but if so desired\r\nmay be stopped up at leisure with only a few hands with stops provided\r\nfor that purpose.\r\n\r\nIn case of a sudden squall the sail may be hauled up the usual way.\r\nThe buntlines will draw the part of the sail below the reef well up on\r\nthe part above the reefyard, and remain becalmed, while the weight of\r\nthe reefspar will prevent any slatting or danger of losing the sail\r\nany more than any other sail clewed up.\r\n\r\nIn case there is steam power at hand, all three reef-tackles may be\r\nhauled simultaneously, easing sheet and tack sufficiently to let the\r\nwind out of the sail without shaking.\r\n\r\nThere are other advantages gained by this method; while its\r\nessentials are positive, quick reefing from the deck in all weathers,\r\nit is also better reefed than by the old method. For by this new\r\nmethod the sail is not strained or torn, and the sail will wear\r\nlonger, not being subject to such straining.\r\n\r\nIt may be carried longer, as the spar supports the sail like a band,\r\nespecially an old sail.\r\n\r\nThis method does not interfere with the use of the so called\r\nmidship-tack, but change of putting on bands, from the leech of the\r\nsail at the reef to the center tack would be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the spar may be considered by some as objectionable, (an\r\nold argument against double-topsail yards). The spar used for the reef\r\nmay be about one-half the diameter of the yard on which it is to be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nSuch critics do not consider that a crew of men aloft on the yard are\r\nseveral times heavier than such a spar.\r\n\r\nL.K.

LEYKAM and TOSEFOTHAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nJute is well known as a very cheap fiber, and its employment in\r\ntextile industry is consequently both extensive and always increasing.\r\nAccompanying this increase is a corresponding one in the amount of old\r\nwaste jute, which can be employed for the manufacture of paper.\r\n\r\nUp to the present time, only very little use has been made of jute for\r\nthe manufacture of thread and the finer fabrics, because the\r\ndifficulty of bleaching the fiber satisfactorily has proved a very\r\nserious hindrance to its improvement by chemical means. All the\r\nmethods hitherto proposed for bleaching jute are so costly that they\r\ncan scarcely be made to pay; and, moreover, in many cases, the jute is\r\nscarcely bleached, and loses considerably in firmness and weight,\r\nowing to the large quantities of bleaching agents which have to be\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this difficulty, the enormous quantities of jute\r\nscraps, which are always available, are utilized in paper making\r\nalmost entirely for the production of ordinary wrapping paper, which\r\nis, at the best, of medium quality. In the well known work of Hoffmann\r\nand Muller, the authors refer to the great difficulty of bleaching\r\njute, and therefore recommend that it be not used for making white\r\npapers.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Leykam and Tosefothal have succeeded in bleaching it, and\r\nrendering the fiber perfectly white, by a new process, simple and\r\ncheap (which we describe below), so that their method can be very\r\nadvantageously employed in the paper industry.\r\n\r\nThe jute fiber only loses very little of its original firmness and\r\nweight; but, on the other hand, gains largely in pliability and\r\nelasticity, so that the paper made from it is of great strength, and\r\nnot only resists tearing, but especially crumpling and breaking.\r\n\r\nThe jute may be submitted to the process in any form whatever, either\r\ncrude, in scraps, or as thread or tissue.\r\n\r\nThe material to be bleached is first treated with gaseous chlorine or\r\nchlorine water, in order to attack the jute pigment, which is very\r\ndifficult to bleach, until it takes an orange shade. After having\r\nremoved the acids, etc., formed by this treatment, the jute is placed\r\nin a weak alkaline bath, cold or hot, of caustic soda, caustic potash,\r\ncaustic ammonia, quicklime, sodium or potassium carbonate, etc., or a\r\nmixture of several of these substances, which converts the greatest\r\npart of the jute pigment, already altered by the chlorine, into a form\r\neasily soluble in water, so that the pigment can be readily removed by\r\na washing with water. After this washing the jute can be bleached as\r\neasily as any other vegetable fiber in the ordinary manner, by means\r\nof bleaching powder, etc., and an excellent fibrous material is\r\nobtained, which can be made use of with advantage in the textile and\r\npaper industries.\r\n\r\nThe application of the process may be illustrated by an example:\r\n\r\nOne hundred kilos. of waste jute scraps are first of all treated in\r\nthe manner usually employed in the paper industry; 15 per cent. of\r\nquicklime is added, and they are treated for 10 hours at a pressure of\r\n1½ atmospheres. The scraps are then freed from water by means of a\r\nhydro-extractor, or a press, and finally saturated with chlorine in a\r\ngas chamber for 24 hours or less, according to the requirements of the\r\ncase. Every 100 kilos. of jute requires 75 kilos. of hydrochloric acid\r\n(20° B.) and 20 kilos. of manganese peroxide (78-80 per cent.).\r\n\r\nThe jute then takes an orange color, and is subsequently washed in a\r\ntank, a kilo. of caustic soda being added per 100 kilos. of jute; this\r\namount of alkali is sufficient to dissolve the pigment, which colors\r\nthe water flowing from the washer a deep brown. After washing, the\r\njute can be completely bleached by the use of 5-7 kilos. of bleaching\r\npowder per 100 kilos. of jute.--_Mon. de la Teinture_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INDEPENDENT--STORAGE OR PRIMARY BATTERY--SYSTEM OF ELECTRIC MOTIVE\r\nPOWER.[1]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: Abstract of a paper read before the American Streel\r\n  Railway Association, Oct. 23, 1891.]\r\n\r\nBy KNIGHT NEFTEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nOwing to a variety of causes, the system which was assigned to me at\r\nthe last convention to report on has made less material progress in a\r\ncommercial way than its competitors.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIMARY BATTERIES.\r\n\r\nSo far, primary batteries have been applied only to the operation of\r\nthe smallest stationary motors. Their application in the near future\r\nto traction may, I think, be entirely disregarded. Were it not a\r\npurely technical matter, it might be easily demonstrated, with our\r\nknowledge of electro-chemistry, that such an arrangement as an\r\nelectric primary battery driving a car is an impossibility.\r\n\r\nIn view of the claims of certain inventors, I regret to be obliged to\r\nmake so absolute a statement; but the results so far have produced\r\nnothing of value.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECONDARY BATTERIES.\r\n\r\nThe application of secondary or storage batteries to electrical\r\ntraction has been accomplished in a number of cities, with a varying\r\namount of success. Roads equipped by batteries have now been\r\nsufficiently long in operation to allow us to draw some conclusions as\r\nto the practical results obtained and what is possible in the near\r\nfuture. The advantages which have been demonstrated on Madison Avenue,\r\nin New York; Dubuque, Iowa; Washington, D.C., and elsewhere, may be\r\nsummarized as follows:\r\n\r\n_First_. The independent feature of the system. The cars independent\r\nof each other, and free from drawbacks of broken trolley wires;\r\ntemporary stoppages at the power station; the grounding of one motor\r\naffecting other motors, and sudden and severe strains upon the\r\nmachinery at the power station, such as frequently occur in direct\r\nsystems; the absence of all street structures and repairs to the same,\r\nand the loss by grounds and leakages, are also very considerable\r\nadvantages, both as to economy and satisfactory operation.\r\n\r\n_Second_. The comparatively small space required for the power\r\nstation. Each car being provided with two or more sets of batteries,\r\nthe same can be charged at a uniform rate without undue strain on the\r\nmachinery of the power station, and as it can be done more rapidly\r\nthan the discharge required for the operation of the motors, a less\r\namount of general machinery is necessary for a given amount of work.\r\n\r\nAnother and important advantage of the system is the low pressure of\r\nthe current used to supply the motors, and the consequent increased\r\ndurability of the motor, and practically absolute safety to life from\r\nelectrical shock.\r\n\r\nIt has been demonstrated also that the cars can be easily handled in\r\nthe street; run at any desired speed, and reversed with far more\r\nsafety to the armature of the motor than in the direct system. The\r\nincreased weight requires simply more brake leverage.\r\n\r\nThe modern battery, improved in many of its details during the last\r\nyear, is still an unknown quantity as to durability. There is the same\r\ndoubt concerning this as there was at the time incandescent lamps were\r\nfirst introduced. At that time some phenomenal records were made by\r\nlamps grouped with other lamps.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, some plates appeared to be almost indestructible, while\r\nothers, made practically in the same manner, deteriorate within a very\r\nshort time. It is, consequently, very difficult to exactly and fairly\r\nplace a limit on the life of the positive plates as yet. Speaking\r\nsimply from observation of a large number of plates of various kinds,\r\nI am inclined to put the limit at about eight months; though it is\r\nclaimed by some of the more prominent manufacturers--and undoubtedly\r\nit is true in special cases--that entire elements have lasted ten\r\nmonths, and even longer.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, however, that the jolting and handling to which\r\nthese batteries are subjected, in traction work, increases the\r\ntendency to disintegrate, buckle and short circuit, and that the\r\nrecord for durability for this application can never be the same as\r\nfor stationary work. A serious inconvenience to the use of batteries\r\nin traction work is the necessary presence of the liquid in the jars.\r\nThis causes the whole equipment to be somewhat cumbersome, and unless\r\narranged with great care, and with a variety of devices lately\r\ndesigned, a source of considerable annoyance.\r\n\r\nThe connections between the plates, which formerly gave so much\r\ntrouble by breaking off, have been perfected so as to prevent this\r\ndifficulty, and the shape of the jars has been designed to prevent the\r\nspilling of the acid while the car is running. The car seats are now\r\npractically hermetically sealed, so that the escaping gases are not\r\noffensive to the passengers.\r\n\r\nThe handling of the batteries is an exceedingly important\r\nconsideration. Many devices have been invented to render this easy and\r\ncheap. I have witnessed the changing of batteries in a car, one set\r\nbeing taken out and a charged set replaced by four men in the short\r\nspace of three minutes. This is accomplished by electrical elevators,\r\nwhich move the batteries opposite the car, and upon the platforms of\r\nwhich the discharged elements are again charged.\r\n\r\nThe general conclusions which the year's experience and progress have\r\nafforded us an opportunity to make may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\nStorage battery cars are as yet applicable only to those roads which\r\nare practically level; where the direct system cannot be used, and\r\nwhere cable traction cannot be used; and applicable to those roads\r\nonly at about the same cost as horse traction.\r\n\r\nI feel justified in making this statement in view of the guarantees\r\nwhich some of the more prominent manufacturers of batteries are\r\nwilling to enter into, and which practically insure the customer\r\nagainst loss due to the deterioration of plates: leaving the question\r\nof the responsibility of the company the only one for him to look\r\ninto.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE ELIMINATION OF SULPHUR FROM PIG IRON.[1]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: Paper read before the Iron and Steel Institute.]\r\n\r\nBy J. MASSENEZ, Hoerde.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf in the acid and the basic Bessemer processes the molten pig iron is\r\ntaken direct to the converter from the blast furnace, there is the\r\ndisadvantage that the running of the individual blast furnaces can\r\nhardly ever be kept so uniform as it is desirable should be the case\r\nin order to secure regularity in the converter charges. In the\r\nmanufacture of Bessemer steel the variable proportions of silicon and\r\nof carbon here come chiefly under consideration, while in the basic\r\nprocess it is chiefly the varying proportions of silicon and of\r\nsulphur; and in cases where either ores containing variable\r\npercentages of phosphorus, or puddle slags, are treated, the varying\r\nproportion of phosphorus has also to be considered. This disadvantage\r\nof the irregular composition of the individual blast furnace charges\r\nis obviated in a simple and effective manner by W.R. Jones's mixing\r\nprocess. In this as much pig iron from the various blast furnaces of a\r\nworks as is sufficient for a large number of Bessemer charges, say\r\nfrom seven to twelve charges, or, in other words, from 70 to 120 tons\r\nof pig iron, is placed in a mixing vessel. Only a portion of pig iron\r\nplaced in the mixer is taken for further treatment for steel, while\r\nnew supplies of pig iron are brought from the blast furnace. In this\r\nway homogeneity sufficient for practical purposes is obtained.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of phosphoric pig iron, which is employed in the\r\nproduction of basic steel, it is, however, not sufficient merely to\r\nconduct the molten pig iron in large quantities to the converter in a\r\nmixed condition, but the problem here is to render the proportion of\r\nsulphur also independent of the blast furnace process to such an\r\nextent that the proportion of sulphur in the finished steel is so low\r\nthat the quality of the steel is in no way influenced by it. The\r\nquestion of desulphurization has, especially of late years, become of\r\nthe utmost importance, at any rate for the iron industry of the\r\nContinent. By the great strike of 1889, the German colliers have\r\nsucceeded in greatly improving their wages; and with this increase in\r\nwages not only is there a distinct diminution in the amount of coal\r\nwrought, but, unfortunately, the coal produced since then is raised in\r\na much less pure condition than was formerly the case. Consequently\r\nthe proportion of sulphur in the coke has considerably increased.\r\nWhereas formerly this proportion did not exceed one per cent., it has\r\nnow in many cases risen to 18 per cent.; so that an unpleasant ratio\r\nexists between the wages of the workmen and the amount of sulphur in\r\nthe coal raised. It is therefore not remarkable that, even when ores\r\nfairly free from sulphur are treated, it easily happens that a\r\nsulphureted pig iron is obtained.\r\n\r\nIn order to effect satisfactory desulphurization, attention has been\r\nbestowed on the fact that iron sulphide is converted by manganese into\r\nmanganese sulphide and iron. If sulphureted pig iron, poor in\r\nmanganese, is added in a fluid condition to manganiferous molten pig\r\niron, poor in sulphur, the metal is desulphurized, and a manganese\r\nsulphide slag is formed. It may be urged that it does not seem\r\nnecessary to effect the desulphurization by means of the reaction of\r\nthe manganese and iron sulphide outside of the blast furnace, as it is\r\npossible, by suitably directing the blast furnace, by the employment\r\nof manganiferous ores or highly basic slag, so to desulphurize the\r\niron in the blast furnace itself that it would be unnecessary further\r\nto lower the percentage of sulphur. Every blast furnace manager,\r\nhowever, will have observed that, even with every precaution in the\r\nblast furnace practice, pig iron will often be obtained with so high a\r\npercentage of sulphur as to render it useless for the Bessemer acid or\r\nbasic processes. If the desulphurization in the blast furnace is\r\ncarried sufficiently far, it is always necessary to work the furnace\r\nhot, and thus to obtain hotter iron than is desirable for further\r\ntreatment in the converter. On the other hand, the method of further\r\ndesulphurization outside the blast furnace, described in this paper,\r\npresents the double advantage that part of the blast furnace can be\r\nkept cooler, and thus lime and coke be saved, and that there is a\r\ncertainty that no red-short charges are obtained in the treatment in\r\nthe converter, while the pig iron passes to the converter at a\r\nsuitable temperature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 1 through 5]\r\n\r\nA further advantage presented by the direct process described in this\r\npaper is that the Bessemer works is independent of the time at which\r\nthe individual blast furnaces are tapped, as the pig iron required for\r\nthe Bessemer process can be taken at any moment from the\r\ndesulphurizing plant. In Hoerde, where the mixing and desulphurizing\r\nprocess has for a considerable time been regularly in use, it has been\r\nfound that all the chief difficulties formerly encountered in the\r\nmethod of taking the fluid pig iron direct from the various blast\r\nfurnaces to the converter have been obviated. At Hoerde the mixing and\r\ndesulphurizing plant shown in the accompanying engravings is employed.\r\nThis apparatus holds 70 tons of pig iron. It is, however, advisable to\r\nhave an apparatus of greater capacity, say 120 tons. The apparatus has\r\nthe shape of a converter, and the hydraulic machinery by which it is\r\nmoved is simple and effective. An hydraulic pressure of eight\r\natmospheres is sufficient to set it in motion. The vessel is provided\r\nwith a double lining of firebricks of the same quality as those used\r\nfor the lining of blast furnaces. This lining is gradually attacked\r\nonly along the slag line, and does not require repair until it has\r\nbeen in use for some six weeks. Further repairs are then necessary\r\nevery three weeks. Only the few courses of spoilt bricks are renewed,\r\nand for the repairs, including the cooling of the vessel, a period of\r\ntwo or three days is required. At the end of the week the vessel is\r\nkept filled, so that its contents suffice for the last charge to be\r\nblown on Saturday. On Sunday night the vessel is again filled. The\r\nconsumption of manganese is very low; theoretically, it is the\r\nquantity required for the formation of manganese sulphide, and in\r\npractice it has been found that this amounts to about 0.2 per cent.\r\nThe proportion of manganese which the desulphurized pig iron coming\r\nfrom the vessel should contain is best kept at about 1.5 per cent. in\r\norder to render the desulphurization as complete as possible. Thus, a\r\nmean proportion of 1.7 per cent. of manganese in the pig iron passing\r\ninto the vessel is more than sufficient to effect a thorough\r\ndesulphurization. Indeed, 1 to 1.2 per cent. of manganese is\r\nsufficient to effect a satisfactory desulphurization. For the extent\r\nof the removal of the sulphur, the temperature and the duration of the\r\nreaction are of importance. It has been found that if highly\r\nsulphureted pig iron is poured from the blast furnace into the\r\ndesulphurizing vessel, fifteen to twenty minutes are sufficient to\r\neffect the desulphurization requisite for the steel process. The part\r\nplayed by the duration of the process is seen from the results\r\nobtained with the last charges, if the vessel is emptied at the end of\r\nthe week without fresh pig iron being added from the blast furnace.\r\nIf, for example, 60 tons of pig iron with 0.065 per cent. of sulphur\r\nremain in the vessel, the proportion of sulphur with the last charges\r\nfalls to 0.03 per cent. The iron in the vessel remains sufficiently\r\nfluid for several hours. When necessary, a little wood is thrown in.\r\nIt has been found quite unnecessary to obtain heat by passing and\r\nburning a current of gas above the bath of metal.\r\n\r\nA number of results, showing the separation of sulphur at the Hoerde\r\nWorks, was published a few months ago[2] by Professor P. Tunner, one\r\nof our honorary members.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 2: \"Oesterreichische Zeitschrift fur Berg und\r\n  Huttenwesen,\" 1891, No. 19.]\r\n\r\nThe totals represent, respectively, 138,500 kilogrammes of pig iron\r\nand 98,654 kilogrammes of sulphur.\r\n\r\nThus, from 138,500 kilogrammes of pig iron there has been eliminated\r\n179,577-98,654 = 80,923 kilogrammes of sulphur, or, in other words,\r\n45.063 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of sulphur in the slags rises with that in the iron\r\nfrom the blast furnace to 17 per cent., an inappreciable portion of\r\nthe sulphur of the slag being oxidized to sulphurous anhydride by\r\naccess of air. An analysis of the slag yielded the following results:\r\n\r\n                                Per cent.\r\n  Sulphur                        17.07\r\n  Manganese                      30.31\r\n  Phosphoric anhydride            0.61\r\n  Iron                            7.13\r\n  Bases                          35.04\r\n\r\nAn analysis of an average sample gave:\r\n\r\n                                Per cent.\r\n  Manganese sulphide             28.01\r\n  Manganous oxide                20.23\r\n  Ferrous oxide                  25.46\r\n  Silica                         18.90\r\n  Alumina                         5.00\r\n  Lime                            3.53\r\n  Magnesia                        0.43\r\n\r\nThe great convenience and certainty presented by the method described\r\nin this paper will in all probability lead to its general adoption.

WEBER, Ph.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following investigation of the condition of foods packed in tin\r\ncans was prompted by an alleged case of poisoning, which occurred at\r\nMansfield, Ohio, in April, 1890. A man and woman were reported to the\r\nwriter as having been made sick by eating pumpkin pie made from canned\r\npumpkin. The attending physician pronounced the case one of lead\r\npoisoning. The wholesale dealer from whose stock the canned pumpkin\r\noriginally came, procured a portion of the same at the house where the\r\npoisoning occurred, and sent it to the writer for examination.\r\n\r\nThe results of the examination as reported in Serial No. 552, below,\r\nshowed that the canned pumpkin contained an amount of stannous salts\r\nequivalent to 6.4 maximum doses and 51.4 minimum doses of stannous\r\nchloride per pound. On being notified of this fact, the dealer sent a\r\ncan of the same brand of pumpkin from his stock. The inner coating of\r\nthe can was found to be badly eroded, and upon examination, as\r\nreported in Serial No. 563, below, one pound of the pumpkin contained\r\ntin salts equivalent to 7 maximum and 56 minimum doses of stannous\r\nchloride.\r\n\r\nThe unexpected large amount of tin salts in such an insipid article as\r\ncanned pumpkin, and the claimed ill effects of the consumption of the\r\nsame, suggested the advisability of extending the investigation to\r\nother canned goods in common use. Accordingly a line of articles was\r\npurchased in open market as sold to consumers, no pains being taken to\r\nprocure old samples. The collection embraced fruits, vegetables, fish\r\nand condensed milk. With the exception of the condensed milk, every\r\narticle examined was contaminated with salts of tin. In most cases the\r\namount of tin salts present was so large that there can be no doubt of\r\ndanger to health from the consumption of the food, especially if\r\nseveral kinds are consumed at the same meal.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD.\r\n\r\nThe method employed in the determination of the tin was simply as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe contents of each can were emptied into a large porcelain dish, and\r\nthe condition of the inner coating of the can noted. After thoroughly\r\nmixing the contents, fifty grammes were weighed off and incinerated in\r\na porcelain dish of suitable size. The residue was treated with a\r\nlarge excess of concentrated hydrochloric acid, evaporated to dryness,\r\nmoistened with hydrochloric acid, water was added, and the mass was\r\nfiltered and washed, the insoluble matter being all washed upon the\r\nfilter. After drying the filter with its contents, the whole was again\r\nincinerated in a porcelain dish and the residue treated as before. The\r\nsolution thus obtained was properly diluted and saturated with\r\nhydrogen sulphide. After standing about twelve hours in a covered\r\nbeaker the precipitate was filtered off and the tin weighed as stannic\r\noxide.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULTS OF EXAMINATION.\r\n\r\n_Serial No. 552._--Sample of canned pumpkin, received of F.A.\r\nDerthick, April 22, 1890, sent by Albert F.

VATEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ordinary method of manufacturing the bichromates consists in\r\nmaking an intimate mixture of finely pulverized chrome ore, lime in\r\nlarge excess, potash or soda, or corresponding salts of these two\r\nbases. This mixture is placed in a reverberatory furnace, and\r\nsubjected to a high temperature, while plenty of air is supplied.\r\nDuring the operation the mass is constantly puddled to bring all the\r\nparticles into contact with the hot air, so that all the sesquioxide\r\nof chromium of the ore will be oxidized. After the oxidation is\r\nfinished, the mass is taken from the furnace and cooled; the\r\nbichromate is obtained by lixiviation, treated with sulphuric acid and\r\ncrystallized. This method of manufacture has several serious\r\nobjections.\r\n\r\nThe authors, after research and experiment, have devised a new\r\nprocess, following an idea suggested by Pelouze.\r\n\r\nThe ore very finely pulverized is mixed with chloride of calcium or\r\nlime, or carbonate of calcium, in such proportions that all the base,\r\nproceeding from the caustic lime or the carbonate of calcium put in\r\nthe mixture, shall be in slightly greater quantity than is necessary\r\nto transform into chromate of calcium all the sesquioxide of chromium\r\nof the ore, when this sesquioxide will be by oxidation changed into\r\nthe chromic acid state. The chloride of calcium employed in proportion\r\nof one equivalent for three of the total calcium is most convenient\r\nfor the formation of oxychloride of calcium. If the mixture is made\r\nwith carbonate of lime (pulverized chalk), it will not stiffen in the\r\nair; but if lime and carbonate of calcium are employed at the same\r\ntime, the mass stiffens like cement, and can be moulded into bricks or\r\nplates. The best way to operate is to mix first a part of the ore and\r\nwell pulverized chalk, and slake it with the necessary concentrated\r\nchloride of calcium solution; then to make up a lime dough, and mix\r\nthe two, moulding quickly. The loaves or moulds thus formed are\r\npartially dried in the air, then completely dried in a furnace at a\r\nmoderate temperature, and finally baked, to effect the reduction of\r\nthe carbonate of calcium into caustic lime. It is only necessary then\r\nto expose the loaves to the air at the ordinary temperature, for the\r\noxidation of the sesquioxide of chromium will go on by degrees without\r\nany manipulation, by the action of the atmospheric air, the matter\r\nthus prepared having a sufficient porosity to allow the air free\r\naccess to the interior of the mass. Under ordinary conditions the\r\noxidation will be completed in a month. The division of this\r\nwork--mixing, slaking or thinning, roasting or baking, and subjection\r\nto the air--is analogous to the work of a tile or brick works. The\r\nadvance of the oxidation can be followed by the appearance of the\r\nmatter, which after baking presents a deep green color, which passes\r\nfrom olive green into yellow, according to the progress of calcium\r\nchromate formation. When the oxidation is completed, the mass\r\ncontains: Chromate of calcium, chloride of calcium, carbonate of lime\r\nand caustic lime in excess, sesquioxide of iron and the gangue, part\r\nof which is united with the lime. This mass is washed with water by\r\nthe ordinary method of lixiviation, and there is obtained a\r\nconcentrated solution containing all the chloride of calcium, and a\r\nsmall quantity only of chromate of calcium, the latter being about 100\r\ntimes less soluble in water.\r\n\r\nThis solution can be used in the following ways:\r\n\r\n1. It can be concentrated and used in preparing a new charge, the\r\nsmall quantity of calcium chromate present being an assistance, or:\r\n\r\n2. It can be used for making chromate of lead (chrome yellow), by\r\nprecipitating the calcium chromate with a lead salt; this being a very\r\neconomical process for the manufacture of this color.\r\n\r\nThe mass after lixiviation, being treated with a solution of sulphate\r\nor carbonate of potash or soda, will yield chromate of potash or soda,\r\nand by the employment of sulphuric acid, the corresponding\r\nbichromates. The solutions are then filtered, to get rid of the\r\ninsoluble deposits, concentrated, and crystallized.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of chromate or bichromate of potash or soda, chromic acid\r\nis sought, the mass after lixiviation is treated with sulphuric acid,\r\nand the chromic acid is obtained directly without any intermediate\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\nThis process has the following advantages:\r\n\r\n1. The oxidation can be effected at the ordinary temperature, thus\r\nsaving expense in fuel.\r\n\r\n2. The heavy manual labor is avoided.\r\n\r\n3. The loss of potash and soda by volatilization and combination with\r\nthe gangue is entirely avoided.\r\n\r\n4. It is not actually necessary to use rich ores; silicious ores can\r\nbe used.\r\n\r\n5. The intimate mixture of the material before treatment being made\r\nmechanically, the puddling is avoided, and in consequence a greater\r\nproportion of the sesquioxide of chromium in the ores is\r\nutilized.--_Bull.

The solution gradually assumes a red\r\nbrown color, and a quantity of tetramethyldiamidoazobenzene separates\r\nin a crystalline state. After filtering from the latter, the alcoholic\r\nsolution is evaporated to dryness, and the residue boiled with water,\r\na deep purple colored solution being so obtained. This solution, which\r\ncontains at least two coloring matters, is evaporated almost to\r\ndryness, acidulated with hydrochloric acid, and then rendered alkaline\r\nwith sodium hydrate, the coloring matters being precipitated and the\r\nunchanged morphine remaining in solution. The precipitate is collected\r\non a filter, washed with dilute sodium hydrate, dried, and extracted\r\nin the cold with amyl alcohol, which dissolves out a violet coloring\r\nmatter, and leaves in the residue a blue coloring matter or mixture of\r\ncoloring matters. The violet coloring matter is obtained in a pure\r\nstate on evaporating the amyl alcohol. Its platinochloride has the\r\nformula PtCl_{4}.C_{25}H_{29}N_{3}O_{4}.HCl, and has the\r\ncharacteristic properties of the platinochlorides of the majority of\r\nalkaloids. The coloring matter, of which the free base has the\r\nformula--\r\n\r\n    (C_{6}H_{4}N(CH_{3})_{2})--N==(C_{17}H_{19}NO_{4})\r\n\r\nforms an amorphous mass with a bronze-like luster; it is sparingly\r\nsoluble in water, freely so in alcohol, its alcoholic solution being\r\nstrongly dichroic; its green colored solution in concentrated\r\nsulphuric acid becomes successively blue and violet on dilution with\r\nwater; it dyes silk, wool, and gun cotton, but is not fast to light.\r\n\r\nMorphine violet is the first true coloring matter obtained from the\r\nnatural alkaloids, the morphine blue of Chastaing and Barillot (Compt.\r\nRend., 105, 1012) not being a coloring matter properly so called.\r\n--_P.

Dornemann is intended to avoid the formation\r\nof clots, etc., which lead to irregularity in shade, if not to the\r\nformation of spots on the textile. In addition to accomplishing this\r\nend, the process is accelerated by subjecting the blue to a previous\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nIn this preliminary treatment of the blue, the object is to remove the\r\nsulphur which retards the solution of the color.\r\n\r\nThe liquid is prepared as follows: The pigment, previously dried at\r\n150° C., is crushed and finely ground, and contains about 47 per cent.\r\nof coloring matter; to this is added 53 per cent. of water.\r\n\r\nTo this mixture, or slurry, the inventor adds an indefinite quantity\r\nof glucose and glycerine of 43° B., having a specific gravity of\r\n1.425.
