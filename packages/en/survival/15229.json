This necessitated unusual\r\nhaste in securing and preparing the material upon which the pamphlet\r\nis based. However, we have endeavored to deal conservatively and\r\nfairly with the various subjects under consideration, and to present\r\nall the information possible within the limits of the space at\r\nour disposal.\r\n\r\nOur purpose has been to supply the reader with an outline of the\r\nsalient facts which account for the marvelous growth and development\r\nwhich the commonwealth is enjoying. To go largely into detail within\r\nthe scope of a pamphlet of this size would be, manifestly, an\r\nimpossibility. We might readily exhaust our available space in\r\ndealing with one industry or in describing a single county. Details,\r\ntherefore, have been necessarily and purposely avoided.\r\n\r\nWe have sought to bring the entire state within the perspective of\r\nthe reader, leaving him to secure additional facts through personal\r\ninvestigation. Along this line, attention is called to the list of\r\ncommercial organizations and local officials presented\r\n[Page 4]\r\nin the statistical portion of this report. Nearly all the larger\r\ncommunities of the state maintain organizations, equipped to supply\r\ndetailed facts relating to their particular locality. Much valuable\r\ninformation may be obtained on application to these organizations\r\nor to local officials.\r\n\r\nAn expression of appreciation is due those who have assisted us\r\nby supplying information and collecting photographs for use in\r\nthis publication. Without such aid the completion of the pamphlet\r\nwould have been materially delayed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 1.--Fruit Farm Adjoining Town of Asotin,\r\nAsotin County.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 2--Asotin County Views.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 5]\r\nGENERAL OUTLINE OF THE RESOURCES AND INDUSTRIES OF WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nThe State of Washington as now constituted, was, prior to 1853,\r\na portion of the Territory of Oregon. During the year mentioned,\r\na new territory was carved from the old Oregon boundaries, which\r\nthe statesmen of that day evidently believed was marked by destiny\r\nfor the achievement of great things, for they conferred upon it\r\nthe name of Washington.\r\n\r\nThat our state, thus highly distinguished, has already demonstrated\r\nitself worthy of the exalted name, so happily bestowed upon it, the\r\nmost carping critic must admit. With a population now reaching up\r\ntoward a million and a half, and with all the forces that make for\r\nindustrial, commercial and agricultural supremacy in full swing,\r\nand gathering new momentum yearly, Washington is moving onward\r\nand upward toward a position among the very elect of our great\r\nsisterhood of states.\r\n\r\nAs briefly as the story may be told, the fundamental facts which\r\nunderlie the marvelous advancement made by the state during recent\r\nyears will be set forth in the pages of this pamphlet.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL DIVISIONS OF THE STATE.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of its varied topography, Washington is naturally divided\r\ninto a number of districts or sections, each possessing its own\r\nparticular characteristics.\r\n\r\nOlympic Peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe first of these districts may be described as consisting of that\r\nsection of the state including the Olympic mountains and extending\r\nwestward from them to the Pacific ocean. Within the limits of this\r\nOlympic peninsula, as it is ordinarily termed, there is standing\r\none of the largest and most valuable tracts of virgin timber yet\r\nremaining in the United States.\r\n\r\n[Page 6]\r\nPuget Sound Basin.\r\n\r\nThe second district includes the territory lying between the Olympic\r\nand Cascade mountains, the chief physical feature of which is the\r\ngreat inland sea known as Puget Sound. The shore front of this\r\nimportant waterway exceeds 2,000 miles, and its length is broken\r\nby numerous bays and harbors, upon which are located Seattle, the\r\nstate's metropolis, and the growing cities of Tacoma, Everett,\r\nBellingham and Olympia. The climate of this section is mild in winter\r\nand cool in summer, extremes in either season being practically\r\nunknown. Deep sea shipping enters the port of Puget Sound from every\r\nmaritime country on the globe, and the industrial and commercial\r\ninterests of this section are expanding with extraordinary rapidity.\r\n\r\nThe Cascade Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe Cascade mountains constitute the third of these natural divisions.\r\nThis range extends in a broken line across the width of the state, at\r\na distance of about 120 miles from the Pacific ocean. These mountains,\r\ntheir rugged peaks capped with a mantle of eternal snow, their sides\r\ncovered with a heavy timber growth, and their valleys carrying\r\nnumerous sparkling mountain streams, with illimitable possibilities\r\nfor the development of power, are one of the important assets of\r\nthe state, the value of which has not as yet even been estimated.\r\nThe mineral wealth of the Cascades, only a slight knowledge of\r\nwhich has as yet been secured, will ere long contribute largely\r\nto the prosperity of the state, while the more moderate slopes of\r\nthe mountains serve a valuable purpose for the pasturage of numerous\r\nflocks and herds.\r\n\r\nOkanogan Highlands.\r\n\r\nThe fourth district is known as the Okanogan highlands, and occupies\r\nthat portion of the state lying north of the Columbia river and\r\neast of the Cascade mountains. This section of the state contains\r\nvaluable timber and mineral wealth in addition to presenting many\r\nattractive opportunities to the farmer and horticulturist. It has\r\nbeen hampered thus far by\r\n[Page 7]\r\nlack of adequate transportation facilities, and for this reason\r\nland may be had at exceptionally reasonable figures.\r\n\r\nColumbia River Basin.\r\n\r\nThe Columbia river basin is by far the largest natural division of\r\nthe state, and, generally speaking, includes the section drained\r\nby that river and its tributaries. Within the confines of this\r\ndistrict are the great irrigated and grain-growing sections of the\r\nstate, which are a source of constantly increasing wealth.\r\n\r\nThis great \"Inland Empire,\" as it has come to be called, has made\r\nthousands of homeseekers independent, and is largely responsible for\r\nthe rise to commercial greatness of the splendid city of Spokane.\r\nOther cities of growing importance lying within the Columbia river\r\nbasin are Walla Walla, North Yakima, Ellensburg and Wenatchee,\r\nwhile scores of smaller communities are annually adding to their\r\npopulation with the continued development of the districts of which\r\nthey are the immediate distributing centers.\r\n\r\nThe Southeast.\r\n\r\nThe Blue mountains form the chief natural characteristic of the\r\nextreme southeastern section of the state, which constitutes the\r\nsixth division. This is comparatively a small district, but one\r\nthat is highly favored by climatic and soil advantages, and it\r\nis well timbered and watered.\r\n\r\nThe Southwest.\r\n\r\nThe southwest is the seventh and final division of the state. It\r\ncomprises an extensive district, fronting on the Columbia river and\r\nthe Pacific ocean. It is heavily wooded and its chief industries\r\nare based upon its timber wealth. The taking and canning of fish and\r\noyster culture are also important industries, while fruit growing\r\nand general farming are carried on upon a constantly increasing\r\nscale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 8]\r\nNATURAL RESOURCES OF WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nProbably few other states in the Union excel Washington in the\r\ngreat variety, abundance and value of the natural gifts prepared\r\nand ripe for the hand of man within its borders. Preceding races\r\nwere content to leave its wealth to us, being themselves satisfied\r\nto subsist upon that which was at hand and ready for consumption\r\nwith no effort but the effort of taking. The impenetrable forests\r\nwere to them a barrier to be let alone. For the minerals within the\r\nmountains they had no use, and to gather wealth from the tillage\r\nof the soil needed too much exertion. Fish and game and fruits all\r\nready to gather were all they sought, and the state had enough\r\nof these to attract and hold a large population. But the vision\r\nof the white man was different. His eye scanned the peaks of the\r\nCascades with its great eternal white Rainier having its head thrust\r\nup among the clouds, and he realized that around and beneath them\r\nmust be a vast hoard of the precious metals. His eye caught the\r\ndazzling grandeur of the white-capped Olympics, but he realized\r\nthat they held in reserve something more substantial to his needs\r\nthan scenery and hunting grounds. The impenetrable barriers of the\r\nforest-covered foothills were to him a treasure worth the struggle\r\nfor an empire. He scanned the glittering waters of the bays and\r\ninlets of Puget Sound and its great open way to the Pacific Ocean\r\nand realized that it meant more to him and to his children than a\r\nplace to catch a few fish. He viewed the vast plains of \"barren\"\r\nland within the great winding course of the Columbia river and\r\nbelieved it worth more than pasturage for a few bands of ponies.\r\n\r\nThe thousand tumbling water-falls that hastened the course of the\r\nrivers toward the sea meant more than resting places for the chase. No\r\nwonder the hardy pioneers whose vision saw the grandeur of Washington\r\nand comprehended its meaning dared a mighty journey, vast hardships\r\nand trying and dangerous hazards to save this empire to Uncle Sam.\r\nWashington, saved by the energy and foresight of a few, has become the\r\n[Page 9]\r\ndelightful home of a million and more, and their possession is\r\none that Alexander or Napoleon would have coveted, had they known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 3.--Chehalis County Timber.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 4.--The Logging Industry in Chehalis County.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 5.--View of Harbor, Aberdeen, Chehalis\r\nCounty.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 6.--Limb Cut from a Chelan County Peach\r\nTree.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 7.--Six-Year-Old Winesap Apple Tree on\r\nFarm of Blackmont Bros., Chelan County.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 8.--Farm of Wm. Turner, Chelan County.\r\nFrom Sage Brush to Bearing Orchard, Showing How Living Is Made\r\nWhile Orchard Is Coming Into Bearing.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFORESTS.\r\n\r\nFrom British Columbia to the majestic Columbia river and from the\r\nCascade mountains westward to the ocean a vast forest of magnificent\r\ntimber stretches out over mountain and hill and valley, covering\r\nthe whole landscape of western Washington in a mantle of living\r\ngreen. The majestic fir trees, which, as small evergreens, adorn\r\nthe lawns of other climes, here stretch their ancient heads 300\r\nfeet heavenward and give the logger a chance to stand upon his\r\nspringboard and, leaving a fifteen foot stump, cut off a log 100\r\nfeet in length and 7 feet in diameter free from limbs or knots. Side\r\nby side with these giants of fir are other giants of cedar, hemlock\r\nand spruce crowded in groups, sometimes all alike and sometimes\r\npromiscuously mingled, which offer to the logger often 50,000 feet\r\nof lumber from an acre of ground.\r\n\r\nBut these great forests of western Washington are not all the forests\r\nwithin the state. The eastern slope of the Cascade mountains well\r\ndown toward the lands of the valleys is mostly covered with timber.\r\nA belt from 30 to 50 miles wide stretching clear across the north\r\nboundary of eastern Washington is mostly a forest, while a large\r\narea in the southeastern corner of the state, probably 24 miles\r\nsquare, is also forest covered.\r\n\r\nTo estimate the amount of timber which can be cut from these vast\r\nforest areas is difficult; estimates are not accurate, yet it is\r\nprobable that the lumber made will in time far exceed any estimate\r\nyet placed upon this chief source of the wealth of the State of\r\nWashington. Of the fir the estimate has been made that shows still\r\nstanding enough timber to make 120 billion feet; for the cedar the\r\nestimate is 25 billion feet, while the same amount of 25 billion\r\nfeet is credited to hemlock; 12 billion feet of spruce are claimed,\r\n12 billion feet of yellow pine and probably 6 billion feet of other\r\nwoods, including maple, alder, oak, yew, ash and many others, together\r\nforming the great mass of 200 billion feet of lumber. Where forest\r\nareas are cut off, the\r\n[Page 10]\r\nsun and air at once start to life seeds which lie dormant in the\r\nshade and a new crop at once starts and the old ground is in a\r\nfew years reforested in nature's prodigal way, a thousand seeds\r\nsprouting and growing where only one giant can ultimately stand.\r\n\r\nOf these timbers, the fir, largest in quantity, is also largest\r\nin usefulness. For bridge work, shipbuilding, the construction of\r\nhouses, etc. it is unsurpassed. Cedar is lighter and more easily\r\nworked and for shingles chiefly and many other special uses is\r\nsuperior. Spruce is fine grained, odorless and valuable for butter\r\ntubs, interior finish, shelving, etc. The hemlock is valuable not\r\nonly for the tannin of its bark, but as a wood for many purposes is\r\nequal to spruce. The yellow pine, where it is plentiful is the main\r\nwood used in house construction and for nearly all farm purposes.\r\nThe yellow pine is the chief timber in all eastern Washington. The\r\nharder woods, maple, alder, ash, etc., are used where available\r\nin furniture construction and for fuel, as are also all the other\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOAL.\r\n\r\nNot content with covering half the surface of the state with forests\r\nfor fuel, the Creator hid away under the forests an additional\r\nsupply of heat and power sufficient to last its future citizens an\r\nindefinite period. The white man was not slow to find and locate\r\nthe coal measures in many counties, notably in Kittitas, King,\r\nPierce, Lewis, Whatcom and Thurston, and to put it to the task of\r\ndriving his machinery. The coal measures of these counties are of\r\nvast extent, and, although little developed yet, there are 3,000,000\r\ntons of coal mined annually in Washington. Other counties are known\r\nto have coal measures beneath their forests, but as yet they have\r\nnot been opened up for commerce.\r\n\r\nThe coal already mined includes both lignite and bituminous varieties\r\nand furnishes fuel for the railroads, steamboats and power plants,\r\ngiving very satisfactory results. Much of the bituminous coal makes\r\nan excellent article of coke and provides this concentrated carbon\r\nfor the various plants about the state engaged in smelting iron\r\nand other metals.\r\n\r\n[Page 11]\r\nThe fixed carbon of the coal ranges from 48 to 65 per cent. and\r\nthe total values in carbon from 64 to 80 per cent. and the ash\r\nfrom 3 to 17 per cent. The coal measures underlie probably the\r\ngreat bulk of the foothills on both sides of the Cascades and some\r\nof the Olympics, the Blue mountains of the southeast and some of\r\nthe low mountains in the northeastern part of the state.\r\n\r\nBesides these coals already mentioned, it is known that veins of\r\nanthracite coal exist in the western part of Lewis county, the\r\nextent and value of which have not been fully determined, and, owing\r\nto the absence of transportation, are not on the market.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINERAL ORES.\r\n\r\nThe general topography of the state suggests at once the probability\r\nof deposits of ores of the precious metals, and the cursory prospecting\r\nalready done justifies the outlook. Practically the entire mountain\r\nregions are enticing fields for the prospector. Substantial rewards\r\nhave already been realized by many who have chanced the hardships,\r\nand there are now in operation many mining enterprises which are\r\nyearly adding a substantial sum to the output of the wealth of\r\nthe state. The ores occur chiefly in veins of low grade and great\r\nwidth and known as base on account of the presence of sulphur,\r\narsenic and other elements compelling the ores to be roasted before\r\nsmelting.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some high grade ores in narrow fissures and in\r\na few localities free milling ores and placer deposits are found.\r\nIn most cases the free milling ores are the result of oxidation and\r\nwill be found to be base as water level is reached in the mining\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nMining of precious metals is being prosecuted in Whatcom, Skagit,\r\nSnohomish, King, Pierce, Lewis, Skamania, Cowlitz, Okanogan, Chelan,\r\nKittitas, Yakima, Klickitat, Ferry and Stevens counties.\r\n\r\nOf the metals the mines of the state are producing gold, silver,\r\nlead, copper, quicksilver, zinc, arsenic, antimony, molybdenum,\r\n[Page 12]\r\nnickel, cobalt, tungsten, titanium, bismuth, sulphur, selenium,\r\ntellurium, tin and platinum.\r\n\r\nThere are also iron mines, and quarries of marble, granite, onyx,\r\nserpentine, limestone and sandstone--beds of fire clay, kaolin,\r\nfire and potter's clays, talc and asbestos and many prospects of\r\npetroleum.\r\n\r\nMining is suffering for the lack of transportation for the low\r\ngrade ores, but prospects are excellent for relief in this regard in\r\nthe near future. The era of wildcat exploitation has been relegated\r\nto the past and legitimate mining is now getting a firmer hold\r\nin the state, and we look for results within the next five years\r\nwhich will astonish many who think themselves well informed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFISHERIES.\r\n\r\nA glance at the map of the state will disclose a remarkable combination\r\nof salt and fresh waters within the jurisdiction of the state of\r\nsuch a character as to amaze one not familiar with it, but learned\r\nin the habits of the finny tribe in general.\r\n\r\nThe ocean is the great feeding ground. Out of its mysterious depths\r\nthe millions of fish come into fresh waters fat and rich from the\r\nsalt water vegetation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 9.--Chelan County Views.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 10.--Farm and Dairy Scene Common to Clallam\r\nCounty.]\r\n\r\nThe great Columbia river in the south, Willapa harbor, Grays harbor,\r\nthe majestic straits of Fuca and the equally majestic straits of\r\nGeorgia on the north are all great open highways from the sea, not\r\nonly for merchandise laden ships, but for myriads of salt water\r\nfood fishes which annually traverse their bottoms. Into these open\r\nmouths flows a great network of fresh water rivers and streams,\r\ndraining the entire area of the state and providing the spawning\r\nwaters for the fishes from the sea not only, but for millions of\r\nstrictly fresh water fishes. Not only these, but late years have\r\nproven the shore waters of the state to produce also great numbers\r\nof oysters, clams, crabs and shrimp. Nor is this all, because the\r\nproximity of the state to the ocean gives it a great advantage\r\nin profiting from the fishing industry among that class of the\r\nfinny hosts who refuse to leave their salt water homes. So that\r\nfrom the whales of Bering sea to the speckled beauties that haunt\r\nthe mountain\r\n[Page 13]\r\nstreams, through the long list of delectable salt and fresh water\r\nfood, the fisherman of Washington has an enticing and most profitable\r\nchance to satisfy his love of sport and adventure not only, but\r\nto increase his bank account as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOILS AND LANDS.\r\n\r\nWashington is particularly blessed in having a diversity of soils,\r\nall admirably adapted to some department of agriculture and giving\r\nthe state the opportunity of great diversity in the occupations\r\nof its people. The central plateau of eastern Washington, made\r\nup of level stretches and undulating hills, is all covered with a\r\nsoil composed of volcanic ash and the disintegration of basaltic\r\nrocks which, together with some humus from decayed vegetation,\r\nhas made a field of surpassing fertility for the production of\r\nthe cereals with scant water supply; but under the magic touch of\r\nirrigation it doubles its output and makes of it not only a grain\r\nfield but an orchard and garden as well. Underneath the forests\r\nof eastern Washington, along the northern border of the state and\r\nin its southeastern corner there is added a large proportion of\r\nclay, a necessary element for perpetual pasturage, and widening\r\nthe field for fruit growing.\r\n\r\nIn western Washington, upon the bench lands and on the hills and\r\nfoothills the forests are supported upon a gravelly soil, intermixed\r\nwith a peculiar shot clay which disintegrates with successive tillage\r\nso that when the forests are removed the soil becomes ready for\r\nall the grasses and grains and fruits. In the valleys more silt\r\nand humus make up the soil, and when the cottonwoods, alders and\r\nmaples are gone there is left a soil deep and strong for the truck\r\ngardener and general farmer, which will endure successive tillings\r\nfor ages. At the deltas of the rivers are large reaches of level\r\nlands, some of which have to be diked to prevent the overflow of\r\nthe tides, which have had added the fertility of the salts of the\r\nocean and are probably the richest lands in the state fit for cereals\r\nand root crops, not omitting the bulbs which have made the deltas\r\nof Holland famous. There are also extensive peat beds which,\r\nscientifically\r\n[Page 14]\r\nfertilized, will produce abundant returns to the intelligent farmer.\r\n\r\n\r\nLANDS.\r\n\r\nThe lands of the state are owned, some by Indian tribes, some by\r\nthe general government, some by the state, but largely by individual\r\ncitizens and corporations.\r\n\r\nIndian Lands.\r\n\r\nOf the Indian lands most of them have been \"allotted\" and the balance\r\nwill soon be thrown open to settlement. Of these the largest in\r\nwestern Washington are the Quinault and Makah reservations and in\r\neastern Washington the great Colville reservation. This latter will\r\nin time make two or three counties of great value, being adapted\r\nto general farming, dairying, fruit growing and mining, and having\r\nan abundance of forest area for fuel and building purposes. Those\r\nin western Washington are timbered areas at present.\r\n\r\nGovernment Lands.\r\n\r\nThe remnant of government lands are chiefly among the more barren\r\nareas of eastern Washington and the poorer forest lands of western\r\nWashington. The method of obtaining title to government lands is\r\ngenerally known, and if not, can be obtained from the general land\r\noffices, one of which is in Seattle, Olympia, Vancouver, Spokane,\r\nWaterville, Walla Walla and North Yakima. The government still holds\r\ntitle to nearly six million acres, and, while the best has been\r\nacquired by others, the diligent searcher can still find homesteads\r\nand desert claims worth energy and considerable expense to secure.\r\n\r\nState Lands.\r\n\r\nA recent estimate of the value of the state lands still in possession\r\nmakes them worth 56 million dollars. They include nearly 3,000,000\r\nacres, a large portion of which is heavily timbered. These lands\r\nmay be obtained from the state through the state land commissioner\r\nby purchase outright on very easy terms, or may be leased for a\r\nterm of five to ten years at a low rental, the lessee receiving\r\nvirtually a first right to purchase.\r\n\r\nThese state lands are as good as any in the state and offer to the\r\nhomeseeker a splendid opportunity for a start.\r\n\r\n[Page 15]\r\nIn this state there are also numerous tide lands, oyster lands,\r\nand shore lands to be obtained at various prices, both from the\r\nstate and from private individuals who have already acquired title\r\nfrom the state.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER POWER.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that no state in the Union is better equipped for\r\ncreating power than the State of Washington. Numerous waterfalls\r\nof magnitude are already successfully utilized. Among these the\r\nmost noted are the Spokane falls, capable of producing 400,000\r\nhorse power; the Snoqualmie falls, with a sheer descent of 250\r\nfeet, with a capacity of 100,000 horse power; Puyallup river at\r\none place is furnishing about 20,000 horse power; the Cedar river\r\nhas a capacity of 50,000 horse wer; the Nooksack falls with 15,000\r\nhorse power already generated; Tumwater falls with 4,000 horse\r\npower, with Chelan falls, the Meyers falls and the falls of Asotin\r\ncreek all in use to limited extent. The waters of the Yakima river\r\nare also in use in part for power purposes, but more extensively\r\nfor irrigation. Besides these there are many minor streams already\r\nharnessed.\r\n\r\nBut the unused water powers of the state far exceed that portion\r\nnow developed. All its streams are mountain streams, excepting\r\nperhaps, the Snake and Columbia rivers. These mountain rivers in\r\na flow of 50 to 200 miles make a descent of 2,000 to 5,000 feet\r\nin reaching sea level, providing innumerable opportunities to use\r\nthe falls already created by nature, or to divert the waters and\r\nproduce artificial falls.\r\n\r\nNo heritage of the state is of greater value and none more appreciated\r\nthan this water power. Since the introduction of electricity as\r\na lighting and motive force, its creation by water power looms\r\ninto immense importance. The exhibition of its achievements to\r\nbe seen in Washington today is amazing to the men whose vision\r\nof light and power was first with the tallow dip and four-footed\r\nbeasts, and later with kerosene and steam. Electricity, created\r\nby our water falls, lights our cities and farm homes, draws our\r\nstreet cars and some railroad cars--pushes most of the machinery\r\nused in manufactories, to the great satisfaction and profit of\r\nour citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 16]\r\nGAME.\r\n\r\nThe State of Washington was once a paradise for the sportsman in\r\nits every corner. Its desert lands were full of jack rabbits and\r\nsage hens; over its mountains and foothills roamed herds of elk,\r\nmountain goats, deer, and many bear, cougar and wild cats. In its\r\ntimbered valleys were pheasants and grouse in plenty. Upon its\r\nwaters and sloughs the wild ducks and geese were in vast flocks,\r\nwhile its waters teemed with salmon in many varieties, and several\r\nfamilies of the cod tribe, sole, flounders, perch, mountain trout\r\nand other fish.\r\n\r\nWhile these conditions cannot now be said to exist in full, yet\r\nat certain seasons, and in some places, the same game, animals,\r\nbirds and fishes are in abundance, and the sportsman, while he\r\nmay not have his \"fill,\" may satisfy a reasonable amount of his\r\ncraving for the excitement of the frontier. The state has deemed\r\nit wise to restrict the time and place within which its game can\r\nbe taken and the amount a single individual shall kill. These\r\nregulations suffice partly to preserve the game from extinction\r\nand help replenish the state's treasury, and are considered wise\r\nand reasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENERY.\r\n\r\nIf Washington is mighty in forest possession, provided with fuel\r\nfor centuries in its coal beds, rich in precious metals, with great\r\nopen waterways full of fish roads from the ocean and millions of\r\nfishes in its inland waters, with game upon its thousand hills and\r\nits vast plains loaded with waving grains and red with luscious\r\nfruits, still its crowning glory is its matchless scenery.\r\n\r\nTowering above the clouds, with its head crowned with eternal snows,\r\nits sides forever glistening with icy glaciers till their feet touch\r\nthe green tops of its foothills, near the center of the state, stands\r\nin imposing grandeur the highest mountain of the states--grand,\r\nold Mount Rainier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 11.--Fish Cannery at Port Angeles, Clallam\r\nCounty.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 12.--A Forest Scene in Clallam County.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 13.--North Bank Bridge Over the Columbia\r\nRiver at Vancouver, Clarke County.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 14.--U.

Army Post, Vancouver, Clarke\r\nCounty.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 15.--Stock-Raising in Clarke County.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 16.--A Clarke County Fruit Ranch.]\r\n\r\nThrough its center north and south the Cascade mountains in a zigzag\r\ncourse lift their clustered peaks and mountain passes from four\r\nto eight thousand feet above the sea, while Mount Olympus and his\r\ncolleagues higher still poke their inspiring\r\n[Page 17]\r\nfront heavenward. Between these two white and green clad mountain\r\nranges, protected from the blizzards of the southwestern plains\r\nand from the hurricanes from the ocean, lie in safety the placid\r\nwaters of Washington's great inland sea, matchless Puget Sound.\r\n\r\nWhere else upon the globe is such a diversified stretch of tranquil\r\nwater, upon whose shores the ocean tides ebb and flow, upon whose\r\nsurface the navies of the world could maneuver to their heart's\r\ncontent, while visible from shore to shore are the vast evergreen\r\nforests, interlaced with winding waters and stretching gently upwards\r\ntill they reach the visible mountain peaks a hundred miles away,\r\nthousands of feet skyward?\r\n\r\nScarcely less enchanting is the view eastward from the Rainier's\r\nlofty height--a vast stretch of hill and plain almost surrounded\r\nby green mountain sides, through whose gray and green fields flow\r\nthe great winding courses of the mighty Columbia and the lazy Snake\r\nrivers, while a multitude of smaller streams gleam through the\r\nforest sides of the mountains over innumerable waterfalls. Here\r\nwithin the foothills you gaze upon the largest lake within the\r\nstate, a beauty spot to enchant alike the artist and the sportsman.\r\nDeep within its rocky sides and full of speckled beauties lying\r\nlike a mirror in the stretch of green hills about it, lies Lake\r\nChelan, and on its unruffled bosom a fleet of boats ply for fifty\r\nmiles beyond its outlet till reach the mining foothills of the\r\nmountains. A hundred miles eastward, still among the scattered\r\npines of northeastern Washington, the Spokane river tumbles in\r\nmasses of foam and spray over a succession of rocky falls on its\r\nway to the Columbia, while still further on the Pend d'Oreille\r\nand upper reaches of the Columbia river flow close up among the\r\nmountains and foothills and present a series of beautiful combinations\r\nof rock, trees, hills and valleys, of forests and waterfalls of\r\nmagnificent beauty. Washington in its scenery is magnificent in\r\nproportions, wonderful in its variety, grand and imposing in form\r\nand feature--picturesque--enticing--\"a thing of beauty and a joy\r\nforever.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 18]\r\nPRINCIPAL INDUSTRIES OF WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUMBERING.\r\n\r\nThe description of the resources of a state naturally suggests what\r\nits industries are. The forests of western Washington inevitably lead\r\nto the lumber industry and the fertile soil of eastern Washington\r\npoint as unerringly to agriculture. These are the two great industries\r\nof the state. The lumberman and the farmer are in the majority.\r\nAlready there are sawmills enough in operation to cut up all the\r\nstanding timber in the state within fifty years. They employ probably\r\n100,000 men. This includes those engaged in logging and the subsidiary\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\nOf the trees the fir is pre-eminently useful, and more than half of\r\nthe forests of the state are fir trees. It is of greater strength\r\nthan any of the others and hence is used for all structural work\r\nwhere strength is of special importance. It is rather coarse grained,\r\nbut when quarter sawed produces a great variety of grains very\r\nbeautiful and capable of high finish and is extensively used for\r\ninside finishings for houses as well as for frame work. Its strength\r\nmakes it ideal for the construction of ships. The yellow pine is\r\nstrong, medium grained and well fitted for general building purposes,\r\nand is very extensively used in eastern Washington.\r\n\r\nCedar is very light and close grained and is chiefly used for shingles,\r\nand for this purpose has no superior. The cheaper grades are also\r\nused for boxes and sheathing for houses and many other purposes.\r\n\r\nThe spruce furnishes an odorless wood especially useful for butter\r\ntubs; for shelving and similar uses it is superior to either the\r\nfir or cedar. It is a white, close grained lumber, and appreciating\r\nin value.\r\n\r\nThe hemlock, whose bark produces tannin for the tanneries, is also\r\na close grained light wood coming more and more into\r\n[Page 19]\r\ngeneral use, for many purposes, especially where it will not be\r\nexposed to the weather.\r\n\r\nLogs frequently seven feet in diameter require big saws, and big\r\ncarriers 50 to 100 feet long, and hence Washington has probably\r\nthe largest sawmills in the world.\r\n\r\nOur lumber is used at home and shipped all over the world to make\r\nbridges, ships, houses, floors, sash, doors, boxes, barrels, tubs,\r\netc. Factories for the manufacture of wood products are scattered\r\nall over the state. Most of the sawmills and some factories are\r\ndriven by steam made by burning sawdust, slabs, and other refuse\r\nof the mills. Coal and electricity, however, are both in use.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOAL MINING.\r\n\r\nThe mining of coal for foreign and domestic purposes is one of\r\nthe most important of Washington's industries. The annual output\r\nof the mines is about three million tons, worth about eight million\r\ndollars; Fifty thousand tons of coke are made annually, worth at\r\nthe ovens about $300,000. The coal mining industry gives employment\r\nto 6,000 men. The production of coal for 1907 was distributed as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Kittitas County, tons  1,524,421\r\n  King County, tons      1,446,966\r\n  Pierce County, tons      612,539\r\n  Lewis County, tons       101,275\r\n  Thurston County, tons     33,772\r\n  Whatcom County, tons       3,160\r\n  Clallam County, tons         300\r\n\r\nThe coke nearly all comes from Pierce county.\r\n\r\nNearly forty different corporations and individuals are engaged\r\nin coal mining. The coals thus far commercially mined are chiefly\r\nlignite and bituminous. These coal measures lie along the base of\r\nthe foothills, chiefly of the Cascade mountains. Higher up are\r\nsome mines of anthracite coals, not yet on the market for lack of\r\ntransportation. As far as discovered they are chiefly near the\r\nheadwaters of the Cowlitz river in Lewis county. Coal forms the\r\nlargest factory in furnishing steam for the mill roads. Some of\r\nthe railroads, notably the\r\n[Page 20]\r\nNorthern Pacific and Great Northern, own their own mines and mine\r\nthe coal for their own engines and shops.\r\n\r\nIt is also the main fuel supply for domestic uses, although fir\r\nand yellow pine cordwood is extensively used when the cost of\r\ntransportation is not too great.\r\n\r\nCoal is also the chief fuel used in steamboats, both those plying\r\nover inland waters and the ocean-going boats as well. Here also,\r\nhowever, the fir wood proves a good substitute and is used to some\r\nextent by local steamers on the Sound.\r\n\r\nCoal is also used to create both steam and electricity for most\r\nof the large heating plants in the cities and in many factories\r\nand manufacturing plants, flour mills, elevators, etc. The fact\r\nthat vast coal measures lie within 50 miles of the seaports of Puget\r\nSound is a very important factor in insuring the construction of\r\nmanufacturing establishments and the concentration of transportation\r\nin these ports.\r\n\r\nCoal is also used in all the large cities for the manufacture of\r\nilluminating gas and as a by-product of this industry coke, coal\r\ntar, and crude creosote are produced.\r\n\r\nThe coke from the ovens goes chiefly to the smelters for the reduction\r\nof ores, both of the precious metals and iron.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETAL MINING.\r\n\r\nThe mining industry other than coal is quite rapidly reaching importance\r\namong our industries. There are in the state three large smelters,\r\nwhose annual output of precious metals far surpasses in value the\r\noutput of our coal mines. The ores for these values, however, do\r\nnot all come from the mines of this state. Other states, British\r\nColumbia, Alaska, and some foreign countries help furnish the ores.\r\nBut Washington has within its borders a great mineralized territory,\r\nnot yet thoroughly prospected and very little developed, yet which\r\nmaterially assists in supplying these smelters with their ores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 17.--Ocean-Going Raft, Built at Stella,\r\nCowlitz County, by the Oregon Rafting Company.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 18.--COWLITZ COUNTY TIMBER. This Stick\r\nWas 301 Feet Long and 36 Feet in Circumference at Stump.]\r\n\r\nThe smelter at Everett receives a steady supply of arsenical ores\r\nof copper, lead, gold, silver and zinc from the mines of Snohomish\r\ncounty which are of magnitude sufficient to make profitable the\r\nrailroad which has been built to Monte Cristo\r\n[Page 21]\r\npurposely for these ores. This smelter has a special plant for\r\nsaving the arsenic in these ores, which materially adds to the\r\nvalue of its output and is said to be the only one of its kind in\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\nBesides the mines at Monte Cristo, there are copper mines being\r\nsuccessfully worked at Index, whose ores are shipped both to Everett\r\nand Tacoma.\r\n\r\nAt Tacoma is located one of the largest smelting and refining plants\r\nin the nation, which draws its ores from all parts of the world. At\r\nNorth Port in Stevens county is a smelter which is chiefly supplied\r\nwith ores from this state, supplemented by those of British Columbia.\r\nAt Republic in Ferry county are mines producing gold and silver\r\nores of such extent as to have induced the building of a branch\r\nline of railroad to carry their ores to this smelter. There are\r\nalso in Stevens county large deposits of silver-lead ores, which\r\nwill be large producers as soon as better transportation is secured.\r\nThis last statement is also true regarding many mines in other\r\ncounties.\r\n\r\n\r\nFISHING INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\nThe business of catching, preserving and selling fish gives employment\r\nprobably to more than 10,000 men in this state and adds probably\r\nfour million dollars annually to its wealth production. The fishes\r\ninclude salmon, which is the chief commercial species, cod in many\r\nvarieties, halibut, salmon trout, perch, sole, flounders, smelt,\r\nherring, sardines, oysters, clams, crabs and shrimp from its salt\r\nwaters, and sturgeon, trout, perch, black bass, white fish and\r\nmany others from the fresh water. Great quantities of salmon and\r\nhalibut are shipped in ice-packed boxes, fresh from the waters,\r\nto all parts of the nation. Of these fish, many salmon, halibut\r\nand cod are caught in Alaskan waters and brought into this state\r\nto be cured and prepared for the market.\r\n\r\nThe salmon are chiefly packed in tin cans after being cooked; the\r\ncod are handled as are the eastern cod, dried and salted. The business\r\nof handling the smelts, herring, etc., is in its infancy, as is\r\nalso that of the shellfish.\r\n\r\n[Page 22]\r\nThe propagation of oysters, both native and eastern, is assuming\r\ngreat importance in many places in the state. In Shoalwater bay,\r\nWillipa bay, Grays harbor, and many of the bays and inlets of Puget\r\nSound, oysters are being successfully grown. In some instances\r\noyster farms are paying as much as $1,000 per acre. The state has\r\nsold many thousand acres of submerged lands for this purpose. It\r\nhas also reserved several thousand acres of natural oyster beds,\r\nfrom which the seed oysters are annually sold at a cheap price to\r\nthe oyster farmers, who plant them upon their own lands and market\r\nthem when full grown.\r\n\r\nThe native oysters are much smaller than the eastern oysters and\r\nof a distinct flavor, but command the same prices in the market.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\nCereals.\r\n\r\nThe largest and most important industry in the state is without\r\ndoubt the cultivation of the soil. The great variety of the soils\r\nand climatic conditions has made the state, in different parts,\r\nadmirably adapted to a large variety of farm products. Vast fields of\r\nwheat cover a large proportion of the uplands of eastern Washington,\r\nthe average yield of which is greater than that of any other state\r\nin the Union.\r\n\r\nThe diked lands of western Washington produce oats at the rate\r\nof 100 to 125 bushels per acre. In some counties in southeastern\r\nWashington barley is more profitable than any other cereal, on\r\naccount of the large yield and superior quality.\r\n\r\nCorn is successfully raised in some of the irrigated lands, but is\r\nnot as profitable as some other crops and hence is not an important\r\nfactor in Washington's grain supply. Rye, buckwheat, and flax, are\r\nsuccessfully grown in many localities. In western Washington,\r\nparticularly, peas form an important ration for stock food and\r\nare extensively raised for seed, excelling in quality the peas of\r\nmost other states.\r\n\r\n[Page 23]\r\nHops.\r\n\r\nHops are a large staple product in many counties of the state.\r\nThey are of excellent quality, and the yield is large and their\r\ncultivation generally profitable. The chief drawback is in the\r\nfluctuations of the market price.\r\n\r\nGrass and Hay.\r\n\r\nGrass here, as elsewhere, is very little talked about, although it\r\nis one of the large elements that make the profits of agriculture.\r\nSaying nothing of the vast amount of grass consumed green, the\r\nstate probably produces a million tons of hay annually, averaging\r\n$10 per ton in value. Western Washington is evergreen in pasturage\r\nas well as forests and no spot in the Union can excel it for annual\r\ngrass production.\r\n\r\nEast of the mountains a very large acreage is in alfalfa, with a\r\nyield exceeding six tons per acre.\r\n\r\nPotatoes.\r\n\r\nOn the alluvial soils of western Washington and the irrigated lands\r\nof the eastern valleys, potatoes yield exceedingly heavy crops of\r\nfine tubers, often from 400 to 600 bushels per acre. All other\r\nroot crops are produced in abundance.\r\n\r\nBeets.\r\n\r\nExtensive experiments have proved that the sugar beet can be raised\r\nprofitably in many counties and sugar is now on the markets of\r\nthe state, made within its borders from home-grown beets.\r\n\r\nTruck Gardening.\r\n\r\nGarden stuff is supplied to all the large cities chiefly from\r\nsurrounding lands in proper seasons, but much is imported from\r\nsouthern localities to supply the market out of season. The soils\r\nutilized for this purpose are the low alluvial valley lands and\r\nirrigated volcanic ash lands. The yield from both is astonishing\r\nto people from the eastern prairie states, and even in western\r\nWashington, with its humid atmosphere and cool nights, tomatoes,\r\nsquashes and sweet corn are being generously furnished the city\r\nmarkets. The warm irrigated lands of eastern\r\n[Page 24]\r\nWashington produce abundant crops of melons, cucumbers, squashes\r\nand all other vegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORTICULTURE.\r\n\r\nThe conditions for successful fruit growing are abundant, and peculiarly\r\nadapted to produce excellence in quality and quantity in nearly all\r\nparts of the state, but some localities have better conditions\r\nfor some particular fruits than others, e. g., western Washington\r\nexcels in the raising of raspberries and other small fruits of\r\nthat sort, its climate and soils being suited to the production\r\nof large berries and heavy yields.\r\n\r\nCertain localities in eastern Washington excel in the yield of\r\norchard fruits, chiefly on irrigated lands. Owing to the abundant\r\nsunshine, the fruits of eastern Washington are more highly colored\r\nthan those of other sections of the state.\r\n\r\nTaking the state as a whole, horticulture is rapidly assuming vast\r\nimportance. Thousands of acres are yearly being added to the area\r\nof orchards, and remarkable cash returns are being realized from\r\nthe older plantings now in full bearing.\r\n\r\nThis is true of all the common orchard fruits, apples, pears, peaches,\r\nplums, cherries, etc.\r\n\r\nIn western Washington large plantings of the small fruits are growing\r\nin favor, some of the new fruits receiving especial attention. One\r\nplantation of thirty acres is devoted exclusively to Burbank's\r\nphenomenal berry.\r\n\r\nGrapes are being grown on both sides of the mountains, the eastern\r\nside, however, giving this fruit much more attention. Cranberries\r\nare being produced in quantities on some of the bog lands near\r\nthe sea coast.\r\n\r\nNuts have been planted on both sides of the mountains in an experimental\r\nway, and it has been found that walnuts, chestnuts, and filberts are\r\nprofitable. In the southeastern section of the state, nut growing\r\nbids fair to develop into a considerable industry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 19.--Royal Anne Cherry Tree, Owned by\r\nJ. H. Rogers, Lexington, Cowlitz County. Circumference of this\r\nTree Below First Limb, 72-3 Feet. Yield in 1907, 1,500 pounds.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 20.--Dairy Herd on Ranch of T. D. Dungan,\r\nKelso, Cowlitz County.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 21.--Douglas County Fruit.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 22.--Douglas County Wheat at Tram Waiting\r\nShipment on Columbia River Boats.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOCK RAISING.\r\n\r\nThe glory once enjoyed by this industry is rapidly changing color.\r\nFormerly, a predominating feature of the state was its\r\n[Page 25]\r\nbig herds feeding gratuitously on government lands. This condition\r\nstill exists to an extent, the forests being utilized, under regulations\r\nby the government, but the herds are limited.\r\n\r\nIndividual farms and small herds are now the order of the day and,\r\nincidentally, better breeds are developing. This is true of horses,\r\ncattle and sheep. The demand for horses is chiefly for the heavy\r\ndraft animals for use in the logging camps and on the streets of\r\nthe cities, and the demand is fairly well supplied, chiefly in\r\neastern Washington.\r\n\r\nGood cows and fat steers are always in demand, and Washington's\r\nmarket for them is not fully supplied from the home farms. The\r\nsame is true regarding sheep and hogs. The phenomenal growth of\r\nthe seaport towns on Puget Sound and the difficulty in clearing\r\nthe lands in western Washington combine to make the consumption\r\nexceed the home grown supply, and many are imported from neighboring\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nThere is abundant room for expansion in stock raising in the state.\r\nConditions are admirable. Grass is abundant for pasturage, hay is\r\na prolific crop, the climate is mild, no pests afflict the cattle,\r\nand the markets are at the door and always hungry.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DAIRY.\r\n\r\nThere are few states in the Union equal to Washington in its possession\r\nof natural conditions suited to make dairying profitable. In all of\r\nwestern Washington, in the western part of eastern Washington, and\r\nin both the northeastern and southeastern sections of the state,\r\nthe climate and soil conspire to make ideal grazing. Particularly\r\nis this true in the western part of the state. All the grasses\r\ngrow in luxuriance, and with proper care and forethought there\r\nmay be secured almost twelve months of green feed annually. The\r\ncrops best adapted for use as ensilage grow well, making large\r\nyields. Timothy, clover hay and alfalfa are the standbys for winter\r\nfeed so far as the coarse feed is concerned, and while mill stuffs\r\nand all grains are high in price, so are correspondingly the products\r\nof the dairy. Butter ranges from 25 cents to 40 cents per pound,\r\nand milk sells in the coast cities for 10 cents per quart.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 26]\r\nPOULTRY.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no part of agriculture is more profitable to the wise farmer\r\nthan his barnyard fowls, and in Washington this is exceptionally\r\ntrue. Eggs retail in the coast towns at 25 cents to 60 cents per\r\ndozen. Turkeys at Thanksgiving time are worth from 25 cents to 30\r\ncents per pound dressed, and other fowl in proportion. Conditions\r\ncan be made as ideal for poultry raising in this state as anywhere,\r\nand with the market never satisfied, the poultry raiser has every\r\nessential to success in his favor.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEE CULTURE.\r\n\r\nBee culture among the orchards and alfalfa fields of eastern Washington\r\nis a side line which should not be neglected by the farmer or\r\nhorticulturist. Many are fully alert to the favorable conditions,\r\nand Washington honey is on sale in the late summer in most of the\r\ncities and towns until the supply is exhausted, and then that from\r\nother states comes in to meet the demand.\r\n\r\nPasturage for bees is also abundant in many parts of the western\r\nhalf of the state, and many a rancher among the forest trees has\r\nupon his table the products of his own apiary.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURING OTHER THAN LUMBER.\r\n\r\nThe State of Washington has natural products either within its\r\nown borders or nearby, to foster many manufacturing industries,\r\nbesides those having lumber for their raw material.\r\n\r\nIn the Puget Sound basin are vast deposits of lime rock, which\r\nis manufactured into commercial lime, supplying the home market\r\nnot only, but is being shipped also to foreign ports. These are\r\nchiefly on San Juan island.\r\n\r\nConsiderable granite of fine quality is used in building and cemetery\r\nstructures, from quarries in Snohomish and Skagit counties. Sandstone\r\nis being used for building purposes and is of splendid texture.\r\nOnyx of great variety and beauty is extensively quarried in Stevens\r\ncounty. Marble of good quality is being sawed up to limited extent.\r\nQuarries in southeastern Alaska furnish rather a better quality\r\nand are more extensively worked.\r\n\r\n[Page 27]\r\nClays of great variety, including fire clays and those suitable\r\nfor terra cotta, are abundant, and large factories in King county\r\nare turning out common and pressed brick of many colors and fine\r\nfinish, vitrified brick for street paving, terra cotta, stoneware,\r\ndrain tile, sewer pipe and other kindred products.\r\n\r\nAt Concrete, a town of 1,200 people in Skagit county, two factories,\r\nemploying 500 men, are daily turning out 1,400 barrels of Portland\r\ncement of fine quality, which is finding ready market in all the\r\nlarge cities.\r\n\r\nAt Irondale, in Jefferson county, a large plant has been in operation\r\nturning out pig iron. It is now in process of being turned into\r\na steel plant and within a few months will be turning out steel\r\nbars and pipes for sewer, gas and other purposes. The ores are\r\nobtained from Whatcom and Skagit counties, some bog iron in the\r\nimmediate vicinity and additional ores from Vancouver island. More\r\nthan a half million dollars has already been invested and this\r\nwill probably reach a full million when the plant is in complete\r\noperation. Although iron ores are present in the state in large\r\nquantities, no other serious effort is being made to supply the\r\nstate with home made pig iron or its products. Here is a vast field\r\nawaiting brains and capital. The above represent only a few of the\r\nmany lines of manufacturing that have been successfully developed\r\nin Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nCommerce and transportation are two affinities, ever seeking each\r\nother. They have found on Puget Sound an ideal trysting place. Here\r\nthe ships of the ocean reach immense placid waters, not duplicated\r\non either side of the continent, and for this reason the railroads\r\nhave come from the interior to meet them. From foreign ports all over\r\nthe world ocean carriers are bringing in great loads of merchandise\r\nand passengers, and the railroads coming from the Atlantic coast\r\nacross the entire continent bring like loads of merchandise and\r\nhuman freight, and here they are exchanged. Teas from China and\r\nJapan for cotton from Galveston and cotton goods from Massachusetts;\r\n[Page 28]\r\nrice and silk, hemp, matting, tin, copper and Japanese bric-a-brac\r\nare exchanged for grain, flour, fish, lumber, fruit, iron and steel\r\nware, paper, tobacco, etc. Merchandise of all sorts from Asia,\r\nthe Philippines, South America and Australia is here exchanged\r\nfor different stuffs raised or made in every part of the American\r\ncontinent and some from Europe. This commerce, however, is in its\r\ninfancy. The Northern Pacific and Great Northern railways have\r\nfattened on it for years. All their rivals have looked on with\r\nenvious eyes till now a mad rush is on among them all for vantage\r\nground. The Milwaukee, Canadian Pacific and Burlington systems\r\nalready run their trains here, while the Union Pacific and others\r\nare rushing for terminals on Puget Sound tide water. And while\r\nthus racing for the great long haul prizes, they are incidentally\r\ngiving to the state a complete system of transportation in all\r\nits parts and for all its multitudinous productions.\r\n\r\nOf almost equal importance to the state is its great fleet of local\r\nsteamers which ply its inland waters, and the numerous electric\r\nlines that are rapidly uniting its cities and villages and giving\r\na new and cheap method of migration. From the city of Spokane and\r\nradiating in every direction, electric lines are in operation and\r\nmore are in course of construction, bringing the most distant points\r\nof the great \"Inland Empire\" into close touch with its metropolis\r\nand great distributing center. On the west side the same thing is\r\ntrue, only in less degree. Between these two groups of transportation\r\nfacilities, and the commerce which the union of rail and tidewater\r\nhas created, the citizens of Washington have found innumerable\r\nopportunities of employment.\r\n\r\nThese opportunities are increasing and broadening every year with\r\nthe continued development of the state and in multiplied and varied\r\nform they await the newcomer who possesses the ability to rise to\r\nthe demands of the situation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 23.--FERRY COUNTY VIEWS.

Its\r\ntopographical characteristics vary from the low southern exposures\r\nof the inland river valleys, where strawberries mature as early\r\nas April, to the mountain summits of the Cascades and Olympics,\r\nwhere winter reigns supreme the year round. Between these extremes\r\nmay be found every range of climate known to the semi-tropical\r\nand temperate zones.\r\n\r\nFor the Homeseeker.\r\n\r\nOur lands include those suitable for the successful raising both\r\nof the more tender, as well as the hardier fruits. Every grain,\r\nother than corn, yields splendid results, while the truck gardener,\r\nsmall fruit grower, dairyman, stock raiser and, in fact, every man\r\nwho aims to secure a living and a competence from some form of farm\r\nindustry will find, if he looks for it, a spot within the confines\r\nof this state that will meet his most exacting requirements.\r\n\r\nTo insure success in any of the above lines requires pluck, energy,\r\nstick-to-it-iveness, a determination to secure desired results, and\r\nsome capital. But given these, the man who is looking to Washington\r\nas a favored location for the establishment of his household gods\r\nneed have no fear of the outcome.\r\n\r\nLand may be secured suitable for any of the different purposes\r\nmentioned, and with proper care it may be made to yield beyond\r\nthe most sanguine expectations. A market is ready and waiting to\r\nabsorb every class of product at profitable prices. Transportation\r\nfacilities are already excellent and the millions now being expended\r\nin new railway construction through the state give some idea of\r\nwhat the future holds forth in this particular.\r\n\r\n[Page 30]\r\nFor the Business Man.\r\n\r\nTo the business man a new state, developing as is the State of\r\nWashington, naturally offers numerous and attractive opportunities.\r\nNew communities are springing up along the lines of the Milwaukee,\r\nthe Portland & Seattle, and other railways now in process of\r\nconstruction, each demanding its quota of commercial enterprises,\r\nwhile the older cities and towns are continually absorbing new\r\nadditions to their population, thus paving the way for new business\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\nFor the Investor.\r\n\r\nThe investor will find an attractive field of action in Washington,\r\nand with the exercise of caution and prudence may anticipate far\r\nbetter returns than he has been accustomed to, without undue risk\r\nof the impairment of his capital. Raw lands, timber lands, improved\r\nfarms, irrigated lands and city and town property are exhibiting\r\na steady increase in value and undoubtedly will continue to do so\r\nfor years to come. The capitalist may take his choice of any of\r\nthese forms of investment, or he may turn to private, industrial or\r\nmunicipal securities which are constantly being offered on excellent\r\nterms and based upon unimpeachable assets.\r\n\r\nFor the Manufacturer.\r\n\r\nTo the manufacturer this state offers all the conditions that may\r\nbe classed as prerequisite to success. Cheap electric power is\r\navailable in nearly every community of any size in the state, while\r\nmillions of horse power remain still undeveloped in the rivers and\r\nmountain streams. Raw material is here, in abundance, and the markets\r\nof the world are accessible through rail and water transportation.\r\nThe principal manufactured products of the state consist of lumber\r\nand lumber products, flour, feed and various cereal foods, butter,\r\ncheese, evaporated milk, crackers and candy, baking powder, soda,\r\nfruit extracts, clothing, boots and shoes, baskets, bags, beer,\r\nice, brick and other clay products, iron products, wagons and\r\nagricultural implements, turpentine, leather products, cordage,\r\nsaws, boilers, asbestos, water pipes, tin cans, railway equipment,\r\nships and\r\n[Page 31]\r\nboats, canned fruits and vegetables and a variety of other products.\r\nDesirable locations are frequently offered free to those who will\r\nestablish manufacturing industries.\r\n\r\nFor the Wage Earner.\r\n\r\nThe wage earner who comes to this state sufficiently fortified\r\nto maintain himself and family for a period may usually expect to\r\nfind satisfactory employment at good wages. Washington has never\r\nbeen exploited as a poor man's paradise, but there is a tremendous\r\ndevelopment in progress throughout the state in every line of industry\r\nand there is a steady demand for mechanics and laborers of all\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is intended to present in brief form an outline of\r\nthe opportunities that await the enterprising newcomer in this\r\nstate. Success is being achieved in all of the various lines touched\r\nupon, by thousands who have located here in the past few years,\r\nand as yet the resources of the state have scarcely been touched.\r\nThe future of Washington is big with promise, based upon results\r\nalready achieved, and in that future the newcomer may expect to\r\nparticipate in proportion to the effort he expends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 32]\r\nWASHINGTON'S EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nThe importance of a complete and well rounded public educational\r\nsystem has not been overlooked at any stage in the growth and\r\ndevelopment of this commonwealth. From kindergarten to university\r\nno link is wanting to supply the ambitious boy or girl with the\r\nvery best training that modern educational experts have evolved.\r\n\r\nThe common school system of the state is based upon the theory\r\nthat every child must be educated, and that the state must provide\r\nthe facilities for the accomplishment of this purpose. This theory\r\nhas been carried out so thoroughly and intelligently that there is\r\nscarcely a child in the state of school age who does not live within\r\neasy reach of a school house. Moreover, attendance is compulsory and\r\nno child is excused unless satisfactory reasons are presented to\r\nthe proper authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATIONAL ENDOWMENT.\r\n\r\nUpon admission of Washington to statehood a land endowment was\r\ngranted to the state by the federal government for common school\r\npurposes which in round numbers totals nearly two and one-half\r\nmillions of acres. This land is offered for sale or lease by the\r\nstate, through the office of the state land commissioner, and the\r\nproceeds constitute a permanent and irreducible fund to be invested\r\nfor educational purposes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the foregoing lands, the state university has an\r\nendowment of 100,000 acres; the agricultural college, 90,000 acres;\r\nthe scientific school, 100,000 acres, and the state normal schools,\r\n100,000 acres. As yet only a small portion of these lands has been\r\ndisposed of. The expense of maintaining our schools, therefore,\r\nis met almost entirely by taxation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 25.--View of the Country Near Curlew, Ferry\r\nCounty.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 26.--Three-Year-Old Orchard, Near Pasco,\r\nFranklin County.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 27.--Combined Harvester Operating in the\r\nWheat Fields of Franklin County.

In addition\r\nto the foregoing, the university will come into the possession\r\nof a number of commodious structures at the conclusion of the\r\nAlaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. For the current year, the enrollment\r\nof students at the university is 1,838. The faculty consists of\r\n115 members and for the ensuing biennial period the legislature\r\nappropriated the sum of $673,000 for the support of the institution.\r\n\r\nThe State College of Washington is located at Pullman, in Whitman\r\ncounty. This institution emphasizes technical and scientific education\r\nand in its agricultural departments has accomplished remarkable results.\r\nIt is annually giving the state a number of highly trained experts in\r\nmodern agricultural science, and the farming interests of the state\r\nhave been greatly assisted by the work of the college. Instruction is\r\ngiven in civil engineering, mechanical and electrical engineering,\r\ngeology, botany, chemistry, zoology, economic science and history,\r\nmodern languages, domestic economy, besides the practical operation\r\nof a dairy farm and other branches of agricultural industry. The\r\ninstitution, in addition to its land endowment, receives annual\r\nassistance from the federal government and a biennial appropriation\r\nfrom the state legislature.\r\n\r\nThe state also maintains three normal schools, located respectively\r\nin the cities of Bellingham, Ellensburg and Cheney. These institutions\r\nhave a combined attendance of about 850 and are the recruiting\r\nground for securing instructors in the public schools.\r\n\r\nAt Vancouver is the State School for the Deaf and Blind. The defective\r\nyouth of the state are cared for in a well equipped institution\r\nlocated at Medical Lake, in Spokane county, and at Chehalis is\r\nthe state training school for incorrigibles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 34]\r\nLOGGED-OFF LANDS.\r\n\r\nThe problem of making a home and providing a competency for old\r\nage upon the lands in western Washington is somewhat different\r\nand more difficult than doing the same upon the prairie lands of\r\nthe east. As they come to the hands of the would-be tiller of the\r\nsoil, they present a forbidding and disagreeable aspect. The loggers\r\nhave left them with considerable standing timber, with the tops of\r\nthe giants of the forests lying where they fell, scattered over\r\nthe land and covering it with an almost impenetrable mass of great\r\nlimbs and brush and dead logs. If seen in the summer, there is\r\nadded the view of a mass of green vegetation, rank and to a large\r\nextent covering up the mass of dead stuff left by the loggers with\r\nthe huge stumps sticking up through it all, mute monuments of the\r\nlost wealth of the forest. In some instances this is somewhat relieved\r\nby the fact that, either by accident or design, the fire has been\r\nthere and swept through it all, leaving nothing but blackened and\r\nsmouldering emblems of its prior greatness. In this case, however,\r\nonly the lighter part of the refuse has been destroyed. The great\r\nstumps of fir and cedar are there still, blackened and perhaps\r\nwith their dead hearts burned out. Great and small decaying logs\r\nare there, some too wet to burn, some with the bark alone burned\r\noff, and some with the dead centers burned out, scattered about\r\nor piled in crisscross masses as they had fallen during the ages\r\nof the forest's growth. In either case it looks different from\r\nthe smooth surface of the sagebrush plains about to be converted\r\ninto irrigated farms or the clean face of the prairie lands covered\r\nwith grass and ready and longing for the plow. But with all their\r\nforbidding aspects, black with a portentous cloud of hard labor\r\nand long waiting, their known hidden wealth lures on the hardy\r\npioneer to the task. He throws off his coat, rolls up his sleeves,\r\ngathers together his tools, and with the indomitable courage of\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon\r\n[Page 35]\r\ntackles the problem, works and fights and rests by turns till within\r\na few years he finds himself triumphant. Eventually, beneath his own\r\norchard trees laden with fruit, and in the comfort and delight of\r\nhis big home fireplace, he contemplates the rewards of his struggle,\r\nas he sees his cows complacently chewing their cuds in his green\r\npastures and listens to the neigh of his fat horses, and at his\r\ntable, laden with all the bounty of his rich lands, thanks his Maker\r\nfor the successful completion of a hard struggle and the enjoyment\r\nit has brought to him and his family.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODERN METHODS.\r\n\r\nHaving thus presented the picture in perspective, we will now work\r\nout some of the details which help to rob it of its difficulty and\r\nadd to its attractiveness. If the lands have not been burned off,\r\nand in many instances where this has been done, the rancher will\r\nfind a lot of cedar logs, perhaps partially burned, and possibly\r\nlong black stubs that it will be wise to save. Cut into proper\r\nlengths and put into piles for preservation, they will make his raw\r\nmaterial for fencing, barns, etc. The cedar is straight-grained,\r\nsplits easy, and true, and to the rancher is very valuable, taking\r\nthe place of sawed lumber for a great many farm purposes. Having\r\ncarefully saved the cedar, the rancher will fire his clearing, thus\r\ngetting rid of a large share of the logger's waste with practically\r\nno labor. To the task of disposing of the remaining logs and stumps\r\nhe will bring modern tools and methods into action. The axe and\r\nshovel and hand lever have given place to gunpowder, the donkey\r\nengine, derrick and winch. Stump powder puts all the big stumps\r\ninto pieces easily. The modern stump-puller lifts out the smaller\r\nstumps with ease. The donkey engine and derrick pull together and\r\npile the stumps and logs into great heaps, and once more the friendly\r\nfire helps out; and while the dusky woodlands are lighted up with\r\npassing glory the rancher sleeps to wake up and find his fields\r\nalmost ready for his plow, nor has the task had half the hard labor\r\nnor consumed half the time that years ago would have been expended\r\nin clearing the same amount of oak and maple and hickory land in\r\nthe valley\r\n[Page 36]\r\nof the Mississippi. It should be said, however, that what is gained\r\nin time and saved in labor costs money. The expense of clearing the\r\nlogged-off land by these modern methods and tools will run from\r\n$40 to $150 per acre, dependent upon various conditions, number\r\nand size of stumps, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are in western Washington thousands of acres which are being\r\npastured and tilled, from which the large stumps have not been\r\nremoved. In these instances the same methods can be used, handling\r\nall the small logs and stumps and litter, and after the first burning,\r\ncarefully repiling and burning the refuse and then seeding to grass.\r\nIn the ashes and loose soil, grass seed readily starts, and a single\r\nseason will suffice to provide fairly good pasturage, which will\r\nannually grow better.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOST OF LABOR AND MATERIAL.\r\n\r\nThe following table, taken from the report of a government inspector,\r\nwill give an idea of the cost of the different materials and labor\r\nused in clearing logged-off land:\r\n\r\nCost of removing stumps from 1 foot to 4 feet in diameter from 120\r\nacres of land in 1907:\r\n\r\n==========================================================================\r\n                 |        |        |       |         |       Labor.\r\n MONTH.          | Powder,| Fuse,  | Caps, | Stumps, |--------------------\r\n                 |  lbs.  |  ft.   |  No.  |   No.   | Hours. | Dollars.\r\n-----------------|--------|--------|-------|---------|--------|-----------\r\n June            | 13,700 | 10,100 | 2,400 |   2,135 |  2,380 |   $650.00\r\n July            |  1,750 |  2,050 |   400 |     239 |    260 |     87.00\r\n August          |  2,750 |  2,700 |   700 |     445 |    324 |    114.90\r\n September       |  1,950 |  2,160 |   500 |     383 |    324 |    126.37\r\n October         |  1,250 |  1,000 |   300 |     237 |    198 |     77.53\r\n November        |  2,350 |  3,100 |   800 |     378 |    283 |    114.97\r\n                 |--------|--------|-------|---------|--------|-----------\r\n Total           | 23,750 | 21,100 | 5,100 |   3,818 |  3,709 | $1,170.77\r\n Av. pr.

Thus treated, good\r\npasturage can be secured cheaply. In time some of the stumps will\r\nrot out and be easily removed. When the stumps are not too thick,\r\nthe lands can be successfully prepared and planted to orchards\r\nwithout removing the stumps, and their unsightly appearance can be\r\nturned into a thing of beauty and great profit by planting evergreen\r\nblackberries and loganberries about them, using the stumps for\r\ntrellises. These berries in the climate of western Washington are\r\nwonderfully prolific and find a greedy market.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPENSATIONS.\r\n\r\nThere are several facts about making farms out of logged-off lands\r\nwhich should not be lost sight of, because they largely compensate\r\nfor the labor spent in the undertaking. One of these is that the\r\nproblem of fuel is solved for a lifetime and for the coming generation.\r\nFive acres can be left untouched as a reserve and in a remarkably\r\nfew years it will re-forest itself.\r\n[Page 38]\r\nThe growth of trees under the humid atmosphere of western Washington\r\nis astonishing, and a very few years will suffice to provide one\r\nwith a wood lot to last a generation. Meanwhile some of the fir\r\nlogs and alder and maple trees will be preserved from the fire and\r\npiled up to provide fuel for the years until the wood lot furnishes\r\na fresh green supply.\r\n\r\nThen, too, as has already been suggested, the fence question, no\r\nsmall item in a prairie country, is satisfactorily answered with no\r\nexpenditure but for labor. The cedar logs, splitting with ease, can\r\nbe turned into rails or boards or posts--preferably the former--and\r\nthe rails put on top of each other between two posts fastened together\r\nat the top make as good a hog-tight and cattle-proof fence as can\r\nbe desired, and these rails will last in the fence for a century.\r\nFor the house, doubtless more satisfaction can be had by patronizing\r\nthe nearest saw-mill, although many houses made out of split cedar\r\ntimbers and boards are in the state, proofs at once of the usefulness\r\nof this timber and the hardihood and ingenuity of the rancher.\r\nBut for the barn and stable, pig-stye, hennery, chicken-coop and\r\nfruit boxes, and a great many other things, the rancher patronizes\r\nhis reserve log pile instead of the lumber yard, and saves time\r\nand labor in so doing. Another fact which compensates the rancher\r\nin western Washington in the struggle for a home which will provide\r\na safe and generous support in his old age is that during all the\r\nlabor and waiting he is enjoying a delightful climate, in which no\r\nblizzard drives him from his work. No cyclone endangers his life\r\nand fortune. No snakes lurk in the underbrush. No clouds of dust\r\nblind his eyes. No sultry summer suns make him gasp for breath,\r\nand no intense cold freezes his face or feet. He can work if he\r\nwishes as many days as there are in the year, and know that every\r\nstroke of his axe or mattock is a part of his capital safely invested\r\nthat will pay back an annual dividend for a lifetime. No soil will\r\nrespond to his energy more quickly or more generously.\r\n\r\nThere is one more possible compensation. Fir logs and stumps and\r\nroots and bark are all full of pitch. Factories are now in operation\r\nthat are turning this wood into charcoal and\r\n[Page 39]\r\nsaving and refining all the by-products, particularly turpentine,\r\nwood alcohol, pitch and tar. These factories are successful and\r\npaying dividends, but are on a large scale and permanently located.\r\nIt is probable that some genius will soon evolve a movable plant,\r\ncapable of serving the same purpose, which can go from one ranch\r\nto another. When this is done, it will be found that the refuse\r\nleft by the logger is worth several times more than the cost of\r\ngetting it off the land with powder and fire, and, instead of being\r\na burden upon the land of $100 per acre, will become a matter of\r\nmerchandise to be sold for much more and removed from the land\r\nwith no expense to the owner.\r\n\r\nAs a final word, it should be remembered that, after these lands\r\nare put under good tillage, every acre can be made to return more\r\nthan the cost of clearing annually. Western Washington has never\r\nbeen able to produce enough to feed its wonderfully increasing\r\npopulation. Meats, vegetables, fruits, poultry, eggs, etc., are\r\nall constantly coming in from outside to supply the markets. This\r\ncondition keeps prices high. It has been so for twenty years, and\r\nwill be for twenty years to come. From $100 to $500 per acre per\r\nyear can be had from fruits and vegetables. The same can be realized\r\nfrom poultry, nor will the dairy fall far behind when the scrub\r\ncow is abandoned and a choice thoroughbred animal takes its place\r\nand the soil is intensely tilled and fertilized.\r\n\r\nThe logged-off lands when first looked at are black and big labor and\r\ndifficulties. When the problem is intelligently understood--undertaken\r\nwith comprehension and some capital and plenty of grit--the solution\r\nis easy and the rewards ample and gratifying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 40]\r\nIRRIGATION IN WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nThe lands which require irrigation in the state are chiefly the lower\r\nlands in the valleys of the rivers east of the Cascade mountains.\r\n\r\nThe winds from the Pacific, though heavily laden with moisture,\r\nare forced to surrender the greater portion to western Washington,\r\nas they meet the cold heights of the mountain ranges. The mountains\r\nthemselves receive a very heavy fall of snow in winter, which fills\r\nthe lakes and sources of the rivers on the eastern side, providing\r\na large amount of water available for irrigation purposes, for\r\nlands not too far distant. Within fifty miles from the mountain\r\npeaks there is a drop of about 4,000 feet. The sides of the valleys\r\nin the main are gradual slopes. These conditions make irrigation\r\nvery feasible. Its wonderful results have been seen and the process\r\nof irrigation has found a wide field within the past few years.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IRRIGATION AREA.\r\n\r\nNot only the Yakima valley, where this method of farming had its\r\nbeginning in the state, but many other places, are now being made\r\nproductive which were once thought wholly worthless on account of\r\ntheir aridity. Among these are the Wenatchee valley, the Entiat,\r\nthe Methow, the Chelan, and the Okanogan--all on the slope of the\r\nCascades. The immediate low lands of the Columbia and Snake rivers\r\nand considerable of the narrow valleys of the small streams emptying\r\ninto them have in many instances been irrigated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 33.--King County Rural Views.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 34.--HOW THE HILLS MAKE WAY FOR THE SKYSCRAPERS\r\nIN SEATTLE. 1907--Last of Hotel Washington. 1908--New Hotel Washington.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 35.--A Portion of the City of Seattle\r\nOverlooking the Harbor.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 36.--Torpedo-Boat Destroyer in Government\r\nDrydock at Navy Yard, Puget Sound, Kitsap County.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 37.--Steamship Dakota in Government Drydock\r\nat Navy Yard, Puget Sound, Kitsap County.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 38.--A Kittitas County Apple Tree.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWORK OF THE GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nThe work of reclaiming the arid lands has been wonderfully accelerated\r\nand widened in scope by the national government. The projects of the\r\nreclamation service now include practically all of the available\r\nwaters of the Yakima valley for irrigating the lands therein. In\r\nYakima county alone there are probably\r\n[Page 41]\r\n260,000 acres now under ditch, and probably 50,000 more will be\r\nreclaimed this season. This is probably not more than half the\r\nlands in the county capable of irrigation. The fact that the general\r\ngovernment is in control of these projects insures as wide and\r\njust a distribution of the available waters as possible. The cost\r\nof irrigation, which is from $50 to $60 per acre, is paid by the\r\nowners of the land in ten annual payments. There is also an annual\r\ncharge for maintaining the canals from $1.25 to $1.50 per acre.\r\nThese projects of the government cover the lands in Benton and\r\nKittitas counties also--both of these counties being in the Yakima\r\nvalley. The government is also engaged in managing an extensive\r\nproject in the southern part of Okanogan county, where probably\r\n50,000 acres will be reclaimed.\r\n\r\nThere is a large acreage in Franklin and Walla Walla counties,\r\nabout the junctions of the Snake and Columbia rivers, to which\r\nPasco is central, which is arid. The government has once turned\r\nthis project down, but is now reconsidering it, and it is reported\r\nthat these lands will soon be put under ditch by the joint action\r\nof the government and the Northern Pacific railway, which owns\r\na large portion of the lands.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile private enterprises are reclaiming extensive tracts in\r\nKlickitat county, and in fact nearly all the counties bordering on\r\nthe Columbia and Snake rivers in eastern Washington. It is probable\r\nthat there are more lands capable of irrigation in the state than can\r\nbe irrigated with available waters. This fact adds to the importance\r\nof the question of what to do with arid lands when no water can be\r\nput upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF IRRIGATION.\r\n\r\nThere are three methods in use in supplying water to the arid lands.\r\nThe first and the one most generally adopted for obvious reasons is\r\nthe gravity system. The waters are impounded in lakes or artificial\r\nreservoirs and carried thence in large main canals, winding about\r\nthe hills so as to secure a low uniform grade. Once established,\r\nno other force is needed but the usual flow of the water.\r\n\r\n[Page 42]\r\nAnother method resorted to when the gravity system is impossible\r\nis to pump the water from the big rivers into smaller reservoirs\r\nleading to the canals, the pumps being kept busy only during the\r\nmonths in which the water is needed. This method is quite successful,\r\nbut requires a somewhat larger annual expenditure. It is being\r\nused in some extensive projects, the water being taken out of the\r\nColumbia river.\r\n\r\nThe third method is in securing the water by means of artesian\r\nwells. This method is naturally limited to small areas, the projects\r\nbeing undertaken by individual private owners. Several spots have\r\nbeen found in the arid belt where this method is successful.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOILS.\r\n\r\nThe soils over the entire areas of eastern Washington on the arid\r\nlands is a volcanic ash mixed with disintegrated basaltic rocks and\r\nsome humus, varying in depth and in the amount of sand it contains.\r\nThe low lands are usually more sandy and warmer and earlier in season.\r\nThe depth of this soil is in some places 80 feet and generally so\r\ndeep as to insure great permanency to its fertility. It readily\r\nabsorbs and holds moisture, and is admirably adapted to artificial\r\nwatering. In some spots there is an injurious surplus of alkali.\r\nIt is generally covered with sagebrush and has the appearance of\r\nsterility, but upon cultivation under irrigation, produces wonderful\r\nresults in quantity and quality of grains and grasses and fruits\r\nand vegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAINS.\r\n\r\nWheat, oats and corn are successfully grown, but not in large acreage,\r\nbecause larger profits can be realized from other crops.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOPS AND POTATOES.\r\n\r\nHops, for example, which can be produced at a cost of 7-1/2 cents\r\nper pound, yield from 1,500 to 2,000 pounds per acre, and potatoes,\r\nyielding from 300 to 500 bushels per acre, and receiving the highest\r\nmarket price, are both more profitable than wheat or oats.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 43]\r\nALFALFA.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa, yielding from eight to ten tons per acre, and commanding\r\nfrom $6.00 to $12.00 per ton, is a very profitable crop. Much wheat\r\nand oats are cut when in the milk and sold for hay, and yield better\r\nreturns than when matured and threshed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUITS.\r\n\r\nThe smaller fruits are very profitable under irrigation, yielding\r\nfrom $300 to $500 net per acre, while apples, pears, peaches, grapes,\r\netc., often far exceed these figures, sometimes yielding as much\r\nas $1,000 per acre net.\r\n\r\nDAIRYING.\r\n\r\nDairying is extensively followed on the irrigated lands, particularly\r\nin Kittitas county, where the cool atmosphere is very favorable,\r\nand the farmers find that turning timothy and clover, alfalfa and\r\ngrain hay into butter fat is more profitable than wheat-raising.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF LAND.\r\n\r\nThere is a good deal of this arid land which will have to be freed\r\nfrom the sagebrush and smoothed over before it will be fit for\r\nirrigation. This expense, together with building headgates and\r\nlateral ditches, building flumes and seeding to alfalfa, will cost\r\nfrom $15.00 to $20.00 per acre, depending upon the character of\r\nthe surface, the size of the sagebrush, and amount of flumes, etc.\r\nSome, however, very smooth lands can be prepared for seeding at\r\nless expense.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISPOSITION OF CROPS.\r\n\r\nThe hay crops are in large part sold on the ground and fed to cattle\r\nand sheep which have summered in the mountain ranges and are carried\r\nthrough the winters on the farms in the valleys. What is left after\r\nsupplying this demand is baled and shipped by rail to the markets\r\non Puget sound, Portland or Spokane. The Sound country is also the\r\nchief purchaser of the fruits, although many winter apples, on\r\naccount of their superior quality, are shipped to eastern markets.\r\n\r\n[Page 44]\r\nPotatoes and other vegetables usually go west, although an occasional\r\nseason finds the eastern market depleted, and then the shipments\r\ngo to the best market.\r\n\r\nHops are sold to be delivered at railroad stations and go east,\r\nmany even to Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALUE OF LANDS.\r\n\r\nThe irrigated lands are yearly appreciating in value, mindless of\r\nthe large acreage annually added to the supply. This is largely\r\ndue to the fact that they are bought up and held for speculative\r\npurposes. However, there are still many farms in the hands of first\r\npurchasers from the government, and others still to be had directly\r\nfrom the government and others from the Northern Pacific company,\r\nnot yet under ditches, which may ultimately be reclaimed. These\r\nlatter can be had from $7.00 to $25.00 per acre. The lands already\r\nunder ditch, or which will soon be irrigated certainly, are held\r\nfrom $50 to $100 raw and from $125 to $200 with water rights paid\r\nfor. Much land is on the market, already planted or to be planted\r\nto orchards, and cared for, for a term of years until the orchards\r\nare in bearing, which can be purchased on easy terms, ranging in\r\nprice from $200 to $500 per acre.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nNearness to transportation is a valuable factor in determining\r\nthe price of lands--whether under irrigation or otherwise. The\r\nlands being irrigated in eastern Washington are, for the most part,\r\nadjacent to competing railways and water craft on both the Columbia\r\nand Snake rivers. Projects are in contemplation by the government\r\nand state to remove all obstructions from the Columbia river and\r\ngive a great navigable stream from Kettle Falls to the mouth of\r\nthe river. This will add to the shipping facilities by increasing\r\nthe number of boats which will ply the river and be of great help\r\nto all farmers holding lands adjacent. Numerous trolley lines are\r\nalready running in many directions--and more are projected--among the\r\nirrigated farms connecting with the cities of Spokane, North Yakima,\r\n[Page 45]\r\nand Walla Walla. These add greatly to the facility and cheapness\r\nof transportation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe character of the climate is well suggested by the crops which\r\ncan be harvested. They include peaches, apricots, grapes, figs,\r\ntomatoes, peanuts, sweet potatoes, and other things which require\r\na warm summer and warm soil. Very little moisture comes upon the\r\nland in the summer. The winters are moderately cold, with some\r\nsnow, which is joyfully hailed by the farmers, for all moisture\r\nis quickly absorbed by the soil and held for summer's use. The\r\nspring season is two or three weeks earlier than in the Puget sound\r\nbasin. Moderate winds prevail during the summer months, coming from\r\nthe east and west by turns, and prevent excessive sultry weather.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS.\r\n\r\nAside from the ordinary agricultural pursuits suggested by the\r\nforegoing, which includes grain-growing, horticulture, dairying and\r\ntruck gardening, should be mentioned stock-raising, particularly\r\nof sheep, many thousands of which are yearly wintered in the valleys\r\nand summered on the ranges. Bee culture and poultry-raising are\r\nalso both becoming important.\r\n\r\nIn closing, it should be said that the activity of the government\r\nand private investors together has given a great impetus to the\r\nsettlement of these arid lands, and the population is rapidly\r\nincreasing, being made up of a miscellaneous assortment of Uncle\r\nSam's energetic, wideawake, industrious citizens, building homes\r\nand making fortunes more rapidly, probably, than in any other part\r\nof irrigated regions in his domain.\r\n\r\nThe doors are open, too, for the newcomers, for ten times the population\r\nnow there can well be made prosperous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 46]\r\nTHE COUNTIES AND MORE IMPORTANT CITIES AND TOWNS OF WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n\r\nADAMS COUNTY\r\n\r\nLOCATION.\r\n\r\nAdams county is in the center of southeastern Washington, cut out\r\nof the once great desert plateau, covered with sage brush. It has\r\ndeveloped into one of the most important food-producing counties\r\nof the state. It has a population of about 13,000 and covers 1,908\r\nsquare miles of territory.\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\nIts climate is not different from that of the balance of the district\r\nin which it is situated, and, although some days in winter are\r\nseverely cold and some in summer hot, its dry atmosphere softens\r\nthe asperity of its cold, and its generous crop yields are full\r\ncompensation for the heat of the summer's sun. Its mean temperature\r\nranges from 30 degrees to 40 degrees in winter and from 50 to 74\r\ndegrees in summer. Its usual coldest days are 20 degrees to 25\r\ndegrees and its hottest ranging above 100 degrees. Its rain and\r\nsnow give about 12 inches of water. It has one small stream, a\r\ntributary of the Palouse river.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Pacific railway cutting the county diagonally from\r\nnortheast to southwest and the Oregon Railroad & Navigation railway\r\nacross its southeast corner and near its south and west borders\r\nfurnish good facilities for handling its generous wheat crops. To\r\nthese are soon to be added the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, the\r\nPortland & Seattle, and the North Coast roads, giving the county\r\nvery superior railroad facilities.\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIES.\r\n\r\nWheat is its great staple crop, and the last year out of a crop\r\nacreage of 275,000 gave to the world nearly 6,000,000 bushels, an\r\naverage of upwards of 20 bushels to the acre. When this average is\r\ncompared with that of the wheat fields of the Mississippi valley,\r\nit is no wonder that the value of its realty has increased for\r\nthe purposes of taxation more than 300 per cent. in the past six\r\nyears. Horses, cattle, hogs and sheep are to a limited extent raised\r\non the farms, and are important adjuncts to its prosperity.\r\n\r\n[Page 47]\r\nPRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nRITZVILLE is the county seat, and has a city hall, electric lights\r\nand water system, flour and feed mills, and is the chief distributing\r\ncenter of the county.\r\n\r\nLIND will be one of the important points on the Chicago, Milwaukee\r\n& St. Paul railway, now building across the county.\r\n\r\nWASHTUCNA also is to have another outlet for its wheat over the\r\nPortland & Seattle railway, projected and building. All these towns\r\nhave good schools, churches, warehouses, mercantile establishments,\r\nand all enjoy an abundance of prosperity from the marketing of\r\nthe crops.\r\n\r\n\r\nASOTIN COUNTY\r\n\r\nLOCATION.\r\n\r\nAsotin county occupies the extreme southeastern corner of the state,\r\nbeing separated from Idaho on the east by the Snake river and from\r\nOregon on the south by the state boundary. Its population is about\r\n7,500, its area 640 square miles.\r\n\r\nIt takes in a portion of the Blue mountains, from which numerous\r\nsmall streams furnish abundant water for all domestic farm purposes\r\nand for irrigating quite a large area of lands, which makes the\r\ncounty ideal for the stock-raiser and fruit-grower.\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIES.\r\n\r\nThe irrigation of the low lands has had a wonderful effect in\r\nstimulating the fruit industry, and resulted in a great advance\r\nin land values, particularly about Clarkston and Cloverland, while\r\nthe cool water of the mountain streams and their grassy slopes\r\nmake the dairy business especially profitable. General farming,\r\nhowever, is still the standby of the bulk of the population. At\r\nClarkston the lands irrigated and planted to orchards have reached\r\nin many instances a value of $1,000 per acre, the waters being\r\ntaken out of Asotin creek. About Cloverland, waters from George\r\ncreek have wrought almost an equal increase in values. Cloverland\r\nis on a plateau about 2,500 feet above sea level, and the lands\r\nirrigated and planted to winter apples are paying handsome dividends\r\nto their fortunate owners. On ordinary farm lands wheat yields 25\r\nto 50 bushels per acre and barley from 40 to 60 bushels per acre.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nThe transportation is limited to the power of steamboats on the\r\nSnake river and the Oregon Railroad & Navigation railway, which\r\nis reached at Lewiston, across the river from Clarkston.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nASOTIN, the county seat, situated about seven miles south of Clarkston,\r\non the Snake river, has about 1,500 people within its borders. It\r\n[Page 48]\r\nhas a flour mill, warehouses, churches, schools, public library,\r\nlight and water systems, and is a prosperous, thriving town.\r\n\r\nCLARKSTON, an important commercial center, is situated on the flats\r\nof the Snake river, in the northeast part of the county. Its population\r\nsomewhat exceeds that of Asotin. It has all the business institutions\r\nof a thriving town, is the main distributing point for a large\r\narea, and is rapidly growing.\r\n\r\nCLOVERLAND, CRAIGIE AND ANATONE are thriving smaller towns.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENTON COUNTY\r\n\r\nBenton county is bounded north, east and south by the Columbia\r\nriver and west by Yakima and Klickitat counties. It has an area\r\nof 1,600 square miles and a population of about 9,000 people.\r\n\r\nTOPOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nThe Yakima river traverses the center of the county in a very crooked\r\ncourse, through the valley of which the Northern Pacific railroad\r\nwinds its way to the top of the Cascades. Both north and south of\r\nthe valley of the Yakima are extensive hill and plateau lands,\r\nwhich are being rapidly utilized for general farming. The valley\r\nlands are arid and useless without irrigating water.\r\n\r\nIRRIGATION.\r\n\r\nExtensive irrigation projects are in successful operation and projected\r\nto bring a very large portion of the valley lands into successful\r\nuse, for these lands, when irrigated, are of unsurpassed fertility.\r\nLands capable of irrigation have rapidly risen in value during the\r\npast few years because of the immense yields of all crops under\r\nirrigation.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Pacific railway through its center, the Portland &\r\nSeattle around its southern and eastern border and the North Coast\r\ncoming into the Yakima valley from the northeast and the southeast,\r\ntogether with the shipping on the Columbia river, give abundant\r\nmeans of marketing its products, while several local electric roads\r\nare projected to connect its towns and help to open up the newly\r\ndeveloped portions of the county.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT INDUSTRIES.\r\n\r\nGeneral farming on the uplands, truck-gardening and fruit-raising\r\non the irrigated lower lands are the chief occupations. On account\r\nof the great fertility of the volcanic soils and the early springs,\r\nBenton county is able to supply the large towns with fruits and\r\nvegetables some two weeks earlier than most other sections, giving\r\nit quite an advantage in prices. The county is rapidly growing\r\nin population and prosperity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 39.--Stacking Hay in Kittitas County.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 40.--New Training School, Ellensburg, Kittitas\r\nCounty.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 41.--Sheep-Raising in Klickitat County.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 42.--Wheat-Raising in Klickitat County.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 43.--Eighty-Acre Orchard in Klickitat County.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 44.--Manufacturing Scenes, Chehalis, Lewis\r\nCounty.]\r\n\r\n[Page 49]\r\nPRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nPROSSER, its chief town and county seat, is on the Yakima river\r\nand Northern Pacific railway in the western central part of the\r\ncounty, and has about 2,000 population. It is the chief distributing\r\ncenter of the county. It has three weekly newspapers, six churches,\r\ngood water supply, banks, stores, warehouses, lumber yards, etc.\r\n\r\nKENNEWICK, at the easterly center of the county, on the Northern\r\nPacific and Portland & Seattle railroads and on the Columbia river,\r\nis a town of much importance, having about 1,500 people. It is\r\nnoted for the remarkable earliness of its fruits and vegetables. It\r\nhas the usual business, church and school establishments, including\r\nan ice and cold storage plant.\r\n\r\nKIONA, on the Yakima river, midway between Prosser and Kennewick,\r\nCARLEY AND PETERSON, in the southern portion of the county, on the\r\nColumbia river, are all growing and prospering smaller towns.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEHALIS COUNTY\r\n\r\nChehalis county is central among the counties bordering on the\r\nPacific, the towns about Grays Harbor being its seaports. It has\r\nan area of 2,600 square miles and a population of 35,000.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nIts industries arise out of its vast timber belts, its fertile\r\nlow lands, and its fisheries. It is said to have 800,000 acres of\r\nmagnificent timber lands, the great bulk of it unmarketed. Logging\r\nand the manufacture of wood products make up its chief occupation,\r\nthough general farming and fruit-raising is rapidly gaining. The\r\nlands of the county when reclaimed from the forests are fertile\r\nand respond generously to the labor of the husbandman. In 1906,\r\n15,000 apple trees were planted in the county. The fishing industry,\r\nincluding the canning of salmon, sardines, clams and oysters, is\r\na thriving industry and destined to develop into much larger\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nGrays Harbor is open to the ocean, but is splendidly protected\r\nand has safe anchorage. It is the largest lumber shipping port in\r\nthe state. The Humptulips and Chehalis rivers empty their waters\r\ninto the bay, and are both navigable for some distance.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Northern Pacific railroad skirts both sides of\r\nthe bay and a logging railroad from Shelton, in Mason county, has\r\nnearly reached the ocean, going through the county from east to\r\nwest. Other railroads have surveying parties in the field, and\r\na conflict is on to share the vast lumber-carrying trade of the\r\ncounty with the Northern Pacific, which has till now monopolized\r\nit.\r\n\r\nChehalis county is one of the most important counties in the state,\r\nand offers an abundant opportunity for Yankee energy to exercise itself\r\n[Page 50]\r\nin almost every avenue of business. Its opportunities and resources\r\nare numerous and vast. The newcomer may look long and find no better\r\nplace for his talents.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nMONTESANO is the county seat, located at the head of navigation\r\non the Chehalis river, and on the Northern Pacific railway. It\r\nhas a population of about 3,500. It has sawmills, sash and door\r\nfactories, and is surrounded by a prosperous farming community,\r\ndairying being very remunerative.\r\n\r\nABERDEEN is the commercial metropolis of the county. Nearly $15,000\r\nis daily paid out to wage-earners. Much commerce from the ocean is\r\ncentering here, 736 vessels clearing from Grays Harbor in 1907. Seven\r\nhundred and seventy-seven thousand dollars has been appropriated by\r\ncongress for the improvement of the harbor. The city has terminal\r\nrail rates, and the Northern Pacific and Chicago, Milwaukee & St.\r\nPaul railroads are hustling after its trade. The business portion\r\nof the city is built of stone, brick or cement. It has eleven large\r\nsawmills, many shingle mills and various other factories for utilizing\r\nthe products of its timber, besides fish and clam canneries and other\r\nfactories. Its population, now about 15,000, is rapidly growing.\r\n\r\nHOQUIAM, Aberdeen's nearby neighbor, has a population crowding\r\n11,000, and is a hustling manufacturing and commercial center, not\r\ndifferent in its general business from Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nELMA, twelve miles east of Montesano, is a town of 2,700.\r\n\r\nCOSMOPOLIS, south of the river from Aberdeen, has about 1,200, and\r\nis a sawmill town.\r\n\r\nOAKVILLE, MAKRHAM and SATSOP are small growing towns on the Northern\r\nPacific railway. Many other embryo towns will in time grow into\r\nprosperous business centers.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHELAN COUNTY\r\n\r\nChelan county is one of picturesque beauty and abundance of both\r\ndeveloped and undeveloped wealth. It faces the Columbia river eastward,\r\nwhile its back rests against the peaks of the Cascades, 5,000 to\r\n6,000 feet above the sea. Lake Chelan is the largest fresh water\r\nbody in the state, fifty miles long and one to four wide, and lies\r\n400 feet higher than the Columbia river.\r\n\r\nChelan county has 2,000 square miles, much of it mountainous and\r\nfull of minerals. Its population is at present about 14,000.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nHorticulture, agriculture, lumbering, stock-raising, mining and\r\ndairying all flourish on the bountiful natural fitness of the county\r\nfor these occupations. The climate is attractive. It is a sunshiny\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\n[Page 51]\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nSteamers ply up and down the Columbia river. The Great Northern\r\nrailway crosses the county through the valley of the Wenatchee\r\nriver and the Washington & Great Northern railway is projected along\r\nthe western boundary of the Columbia river.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of temperate zone fruits mature here in wonderful perfection\r\nand abundance. The valleys run with water from the mountains to\r\nirrigate the lands, and furnish vast power, much of it undeveloped.\r\nHills in the western part of the county are timbered and all the\r\nvacant lands are grass covered. Over 1,000,000 fruit trees have\r\nbeen planted in the last three years in the county.\r\n\r\nThe mountain foothills are full of mineral veins of copper, gold,\r\nsilver, lead and molybdonite. Some have been producing for twenty\r\nyears. Trout in the streams and game on the hills add to its\r\nattractiveness.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nWENATCHEE is the county seat and largest town, having about 3,500\r\npeople. It is located on the Columbia river near where the Great\r\nNorthern railway crosses it. It is the chief distributing center\r\nfor the county and much other territory, chiefly north of it.\r\n\r\nLEAVENWORTH, westward of Wenatchee, and also on the railroad, has\r\na population of 1,200 and is a division point.\r\n\r\nCHELAN, at the foot of Lake Chelan, has about 700 people.\r\n\r\nCASHMERE, on the railroad, is of about equal size.\r\n\r\nLAKESIDE, PESHASTIN and ENTIAT are smaller towns, all thriving and\r\ngrowing.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLALLAM COUNTY\r\n\r\nClallam county occupies 2,000 square miles of the northwestern\r\npart of the Olympic peninsula, having 35 miles of shore land on\r\nthe Pacific and 90 miles on the straits. The Olympic mountains\r\nand foothills cover the southern half mostly, while the northern\r\nhalf is made up of lower hills and valleys. Several large lakes\r\nnestle among the mountains; one of them, Lake Crescent, is a famous\r\nsummer resort. Lake Crescent is known as the home of the celebrated\r\nBeardslee trout. The eastern and southern parts have a rainfall\r\nsometimes nearing 100 inches annually, while in the eastern northerly\r\npart it is about 20 to 25 inches only.\r\n\r\nAn important section of the county is that known as Sequim Prairie\r\nThis is a level district of about 5,000 acres, located three miles\r\nback from Port Williams. Most of it is under irrigation, and the\r\nsoil thus treated produces marvelous crops.\r\n\r\n[Page 52]\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nLumber, fish, agricultural products and coal comprise its chief\r\nresources. The timber of the county is very vast and very little\r\nexploited. Its proximity to the ocean makes it very advantageous\r\nfor all fishing industries. Its valleys are noted for the fertility\r\nof their soils, and many a farmer has grown wealthy from their\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nFacilities for getting about are limited to boats and wagons. A\r\nsplendid boat service is maintained with Seattle and other Sound\r\nports, and a system of public roads is now in process of construction\r\nthat will be unexcelled in the state. Several surveying parties\r\nare now in the woods and it is believed that Grays Harbor and the\r\nStraits of Juan de Fuca will be soon united with railroad iron\r\nand Clallam county will come to its own.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL TOWNS AND VILLAGES.\r\n\r\nPORT ANGELES, located about 60 miles from the ocean on the Straits\r\nof Fuca, is the largest town and county seat. It has a splendid\r\nharbor, with fine anchorage, furnishing a safe refuge for ships\r\nwhen the storms rage outside.\r\n\r\nDUNGENESS and SEQUIM, three miles from PORT WILLIAMS, are important\r\nfarming centers, both noted for their dairy products, and contribute\r\nlargely to make Clallam the second county in the state in the value\r\nof its dairy products.\r\n\r\nQUILLAYUTE, FORKS, BEAVER, BLYN and GETTYSBURG are other small\r\nsettlements waiting for the railroads to open up the country and\r\nrender their natural resources available for the good of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLARKE COUNTY\r\n\r\nClarke county lies on the north shore of the Columbia river, opposite\r\nPortland, Oregon. It has 600 square miles of territory. It was\r\none of the earliest settled parts of the state, and its timber\r\nas yet uncut is large. It is extremely well watered. The Columbia\r\nand Lewis rivers border it on three sides with navigable waters.\r\nIt has a mild climate, very fertile soil, and splendid markets\r\nat its doors, abundant rainfall, and agriculture is successfully\r\ncarried on without irrigation.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Pacific railway connects its various towns with both\r\nPortland and Seattle, and the North Bank and Oregon & Washington\r\nrailroad, paralleling the Northern Pacific, will add greatly to\r\nthe facility and cheapness of its transportation. From Vancouver\r\nnortheasterly a road is in operation nearly across the county,\r\nheaded for North Yakima and the East.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 45.--Mt. St. Helens and Reflection in Spirit\r\nLake, Lewis County.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 46.--LEWIS COUNTY SCENES. Dairy Farm and\r\nHop Field. A Valley Ranch.]\r\n\r\n[Page 53]\r\nINDUSTRIES.\r\n\r\nMuch of the southern part of the county is devoted to fruit-raising,\r\nprunes being a very prominent factor in the county's output. General\r\nagriculture, with dairying, are very profitable, and to these are\r\nto be added fishing, lumbering and mining.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nVANCOUVER has a population of about 8,000, and is rapidly growing.\r\nIt is the county seat, and is connected with Portland, Oregon,\r\nby a trolley line. The Northern Pacific, Union Pacific, Oregon\r\nRailroad & Navigation and North Bank railroads all compete for its\r\ntraffic. It is the central distributing point of the county, and\r\nis the United States military headquarters for Washington, Oregon\r\nand Alaska. It is well represented in business establishments,\r\nincluding barrel factory, fruit cannery, ship yard, iron foundry,\r\nshoe factory, and others.\r\n\r\nLA CENTER, ETNA, NACOLT, AMBOY and BRUSH PRAIRIE are smaller towns,\r\nall holding out an inviting hand to the newcomer, and offering\r\ndesirable opportunities for new business in both merchandising and\r\nagriculture, as well as in lumbering and its kindred industries.\r\nClarke county is one well worth investigating by intending settlers,\r\nboth on account of its latent possibilities and because of its\r\npeculiarly desirable climatic conditions, and its abundant competing\r\ntransportation facilities, both by rail and water.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBIA COUNTY\r\n\r\nColumbia county is one of the four counties in southeastern Washington,\r\nlying on the Oregon state line and south of the Snake river. A forest\r\nreserve in the Blue mountains covers much of the southern portion of\r\nthe county, which is heavily timbered. The Northern part of the\r\ncounty is made up of rolling prairie lands, of great fertility on\r\naccount of the large proportion of clay added to the volcanic ash,\r\nwhich composes most of the soils of eastern Washington. Irrigation\r\nis here unnecessary, and abundant crops reward the agriculturist.\r\nThe climate is mild, healthful and vigorous, inclining to much\r\noutdoor life the year around.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nColumbia county is essentially an agricultural county, but of late\r\nyears is branching out into fruit-raising and dairying with marked\r\nsuccess. Apples and pears predominate among the fruits, though\r\nall others do well. Wheat is, however, still its great product,\r\nand both the Northern Pacific and Oregon Railroad & Navigation\r\nrailroads are in operation through the northern part of the county\r\nto carry away its rich grain harvests.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Columbia county are among the most prosperous of\r\nthe state, its average of per capita wealth being exceeded by only\r\nthree other counties.\r\n\r\n[Page 54]\r\nPRINCIPAL TOWNS.\r\n\r\nDAYTON, the county seat, has a population of about 3,500 people,\r\nis situated about in the center of the county, and is the chief\r\ntown for the county's exports, as well as the distributor of its\r\nmerchandise. It is a substantially built city, with flour and feed\r\nmills, and general mercantile establishments of importance. All the\r\npublic interests, including schools and churches, are generously\r\nprovided for. Its chief exports are grain, fruit, livestock and\r\nwool.\r\n\r\nSTARBUCK, in the northern part of the county, is a shipping point\r\nof no mean importance on the Oregon Railroad & Navigation railway.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOWLITZ COUNTY\r\n\r\nCowlitz county lies immediately north of Clarke county, bordering\r\nabout 40 miles on the Columbia river. It has about 1,100 square\r\nmiles of territory, and about 13,000 people. The southwestern portion\r\nis largely composed of level valley lands, while its northeastern\r\npart is occupied by the foothills of Mount St. Helens. The drainage\r\nis all westerly and southerly into the Columbia river. Cowlitz river\r\nis navigable as far as Castle Rock, and is an important factor in\r\nthe transportation problem.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nTimber is the great source of industry at present, the county having\r\nabout two-thirds of its area heavily covered and unexploited. About\r\n40 saw and shingle mills are engaged in disposing of its logs.\r\nAgriculture follows close on the heels of the lumberman everywhere\r\nin western Washington, and nowhere are better results in general\r\nfarming and dairying obtained than in Cowlitz county.\r\n\r\nCowlitz coal fields have not yet been largely utilized, but will\r\nbe extensively developed in time.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nAside from the river navigation, this county is well supplied with\r\ntransportation facilities by rail. The valley of the Cowlitz river\r\naffords the natural highway for roads between the Columbia river\r\nand Puget sound, and is already traversed by the Northern Pacific,\r\nwhile the Union Pacific systems and the North Coast road are projected\r\nover practically parallel lines through the county. From Kalama\r\nall three systems extend south to Portland and Vancouver.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nKALAMA, on the bank of the Columbia river at the ferry crossing of\r\nthe Northern Pacific railway, is the chief town and county seat.\r\nThere are here extensive electric power plants and a gravity water\r\nsystem. The chief industries grow out of the lumbering and fishing\r\ninterests. It has about 1,250 people, but is just now rapidly growing,\r\nowing to its superb transportation facilities by both rail and\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n[Page 55]\r\nKELSO and CASTLE ROCK are both important towns on the railroads\r\nand Cowlitz river, each having about 1,500 people. At Kelso, which\r\nis near the Columbia river, considerable fish are caught and packed,\r\nyet the timber furnishes the chief industry. Fruit and dairying\r\nand general agriculture provide a large part of the support for\r\nthe town merchants.\r\n\r\nOSTRANDER, CARROLTON, CATLIN, ARIEL and LEXINGTON are smaller towns,\r\nall prospering and being built up into substantial business centers\r\nby the steadily increasing development of the latent resources of\r\nthe county.\r\n\r\nThis county offers many opportunities for business to the newcomer\r\nin either merchandising, manufacturing or farming.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUGLAS COUNTY\r\n\r\nDouglas county occupies the big bend of the Columbia river, having\r\nabout 1,800 square miles of territory. Formerly there were 4,500\r\nsquare miles. The last legislature carved the county in two, giving\r\nGrant county the southeastern part, about 2,700 square miles of\r\nterritory, and leaving 1,800 to the northeastern part, with the old\r\nname. The bend of the Columbia on the northeast and Grant county\r\non the southeast, compose its boundary. This division boundary\r\nfollows the northeastern bank of the Grand coulee, and following\r\nits general direction meets the Columbia river where the Great\r\nNorthern railroad touches its valley, thus putting all of that\r\nrailroad in this new county, excepting only a few miles of the\r\nrailroad along the banks of the river in the southeastern corner\r\nof Douglas county. Douglas county is essentially a high plateau,\r\nsome of it 1,500 feet above the main bank. Waterville is the county\r\nseat, and considerable land along the valley of the Columbia is\r\nbeing irrigated and proving to be of great value for fruit and\r\ngrain growing.\r\n\r\nIn the southeastern part of the county are some lands covered with\r\nblack basaltic rocks, but the great bulk of the lands are rich\r\nin a volcanic ash soil, and produce large crops of grain without\r\nirrigation. A wrong view of the county can easily be impressed\r\nupon the traveler by rail; he will see so many of the basaltic\r\nrocks from the car windows but once up out of the canyon which\r\nthe railroad follows, he will find himself in view of an expanse\r\nof wheat fields so vast and rich as to astonish him.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nAs already indicated, this county is essentially a grain producer.\r\nWheat and oats are marketed in large quantities. Fruit-growing\r\nand stock-raising are important adjuncts to the county's wealth.\r\nIt is comparatively new, and lands can be had at very reasonable\r\nprices.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nAs now constituted, Douglas county will rely wholly upon the steamboat\r\ncrafts on the river to get its grain to market. Its trade, however,\r\n[Page 56]\r\nis too vast to be passed by, and already two lines of railroad,\r\nthe Washington & Great Northern and North Coast, are projecting\r\ninto the very center of its vast wheat fields. With these roads\r\ncompleted as projected, Douglas county will have easy access to\r\nboth water and rail transportation, and renewed importance will\r\nbe given to its farming industries.\r\n\r\nCITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nWATERVILLE is its chief town and county seat. It is among the wheat\r\nfields, in a broad plain, about seven miles east of the Columbia\r\nriver, to which it is connected by good roads for stages and freight\r\nwagons. It has one of the U. S. general land offices. It has good\r\nschools and churches, water and electric lighting systems, both\r\nowned by the city. It has a population of about 1,200 people, and\r\nis well supplied with business houses, flour and feed mills, a\r\nbrick yard, bank, etc.\r\n\r\nBRIDGEPORT, a town of some 400 people, is situated in the northern\r\npart of the county on the Columbia river east of its junction with\r\nthe Okanogan river, and is an important wheat-shipping point, having\r\na regular steamboat service. A bank, flour mill, warehouses and\r\ngeneral stores are serving the community, but other industries\r\nawait the newcomer.\r\n\r\nDOUGLAS, FARMER, JAMESON, MANSFIELD and HOLLISTER are growing\r\nagricultural centers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFERRY COUNTY\r\n\r\nFerry county is about in the center of the northern part of eastern\r\nWashington, stretching from the northern boundary of the state\r\nto the Columbia river, which marks its southern and southwestern\r\nboundary. The southern half of the county is within the Colville\r\nIndian reservation, and is therefore wholly undeveloped. The lands,\r\nhowever, have in fact been allotted and the remainder will be thrown\r\nopen for settlement in the near future.\r\n\r\nAltogether it has an area of 2,200 square miles, and a population\r\nof 5,000. It is principally composed of low mountains, well timbered,\r\nwith valleys furnishing fine grazing.\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the county is such as prevails generally in northeastern\r\nWashington--a couple of months of snow in winter, affording plenty\r\nof sleighing, skating, etc. Summers are very pleasant, and spring\r\nand fall delightful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 47.--A Ranch Scene in Lincoln County.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 48.--Harvest Time in Lincoln County.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 49.--View of Spokane River in Lincoln County,\r\nShowing Possibility of Power Development.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 50.--Mason County Timber.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 51.--Dairy Scene in Mason County.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 52.--Oyster Beds in Mason County.]\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the resources of this county are yet dormant. The mountains\r\nare full of minerals; timber is abundant; grassy hillsides are\r\ntempting to the sheep and cattle, while the soil is rich, and when\r\ntilled will be found to produce excellent crops. The county has\r\na fine future for wealth from all these sources, and, while the\r\nmines are\r\n[Page 57]\r\nfirst to be made productive, without doubt the fruits and cereals\r\nwill come into their own in time and furnish much of its wealth.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nTwo railroads reach the center of the northern half of the county,\r\nterminating at Republic, the county seat. These railroads have\r\npushed in here after the precious metals mined in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe Columbia river is navigable most of its course on the county\r\nboundary, barring some obstructions which the national government\r\nwill remove and thus open up to river navigation to the ocean the\r\nfruits of toil in Ferry county.\r\n\r\nCITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nREPUBLIC, the county seat, is the only large town in the county,\r\nand has a population of about 1,250 people.\r\n\r\nIt is the distributing point for supplies for the mines and ships\r\nout much ore for the smelters.\r\n\r\nFerry county altogether offers exceptional opportunities for the\r\nhomeseeker in a variety of occupations, as already indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN COUNTY\r\n\r\nFranklin county occupies the basin formed by the junction of the\r\nColumbia and Snake rivers, being bounded east, south and west by\r\nthem. The southern portion of the county is scarcely 300 feet above\r\nsea level, and the soil is fine and sandy. The northern part of\r\nthe county is somewhat higher and composed of successive benches\r\ntill they reach an altitude of 1,000 feet. It is only a few years\r\nsince these lands were all considered barren and useless. Yet in\r\n1906 these bench lands in this county added 1,500,000 bushels of\r\nwheat to the world's supply and in the following season nearly\r\ndoubled that output.\r\n\r\nThere are no forests, the land being covered with bunchgrass and\r\nsagebrush.\r\n\r\nIRRIGATION.\r\n\r\nAlong the rivers some farmers have irrigated small parcels of land\r\nby pumping water, but the bulk of the irrigable lands are awaiting\r\nthe action of the U. S. Reclamation Service, which it is thought\r\nwill ultimately be engaged in an extensive irrigation problem to\r\nreclaim thousands of acres now arid and barren. The warm climate\r\nof these low Bandy lands has already been proven to be immensely\r\nadvantageous to the gardener and fruit-grower, and the lands wonderfully\r\nproductive when the magic influence of plenty of water renders the\r\nsources of plant life soluble.\r\n\r\nThe wheat crops now being produced come from the bench lands without\r\nirrigation.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Pacific railway passes diagonally through the county\r\nand crosses the Columbia river near Pasco. The Oregon Railroad &\r\n[Page 58]\r\nNavigation railway taps the wheat belt in the northern part of\r\nthe county and the North Coast is projected through it, while the\r\nPortland & Seattle follows the north bank of the Snake river along\r\nits southwestern boundary, thus giving the county four systems\r\nof railroad, besides the Columbia river steamboats.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nPASCO is the county seat, in the extreme southern portion of the\r\ncounty, near the Columbia river, and is more noted as a railroad\r\ncenter than as a shipping point, on account of the fact that the\r\nsurrounding lands are as yet unirrigated. It has a population of\r\nabout 1,800, and is just now enjoying new vigor and much building\r\nin anticipation of its future usefulness as a commercial center\r\nfor distribution of both merchandise and agricultural products.\r\n\r\nCONNELL, in the northern part of the county, is a shipping point\r\nof importance, and has two railroad lines and a third one coming.\r\nIn addition to the cereals, many sheep and horses are being raised\r\nand shipped out of the county from this vicinity.\r\n\r\n\r\nGARFIELD COUNTY\r\n\r\nGarfield county is the second from the southeast corner of the\r\nstate, and extends from the Snake river on the north to the state\r\nboundary on the south. It has 627 square miles of territory and\r\na population of about 7,000.\r\n\r\nThe southern portion is included in the Wenaha forest reserve, and\r\nis quite heavily timbered. The northern portion is an extremely\r\nprolific farming region, made up of undulating lands with deep\r\nrich soil, composed of clays and volcanic ash. No irrigation is\r\nnecessary, and very heavy crops of grain are annually matured.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nAs already intimated, the chief source of income for the county\r\ncomes from the tillage of the soil. Of the crops raised, barley is\r\nin the lead, having furnished 1,800,000 bushels in 1907, which places\r\nthis county second of all counties in the state in the production of\r\nthis cereal. Wheat and oats are also largely produced. Stock-raising\r\nin the southern ranges of the county is very profitable, and much\r\nfruit is of late years being produced. Indeed, Garfield county is\r\nwell up to the front in the per capita wealth of its citizens.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL TOWNS.\r\n\r\nPOMEROY is the county seat and chief distributing center of the\r\ncounty. It is situated in the north central part of the county,\r\non the Pataha river and the Oregon Railroad & Navigation railway.\r\nIt has a population of nearly 2,000.\r\n\r\nIt is lighted with electricity, has a gravity water system, and all\r\nthe machinery for doing all the business naturally coming to a town\r\n[Page 59]\r\nof its size. It has a fine high school and graded schools, churches,\r\nnewspapers, banks, warehouses, big stocks of goods, fire department,\r\ncet.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANT COUNTY\r\n\r\nGrant county occupies about 2,700 square miles of what was formerly\r\nDouglas county, comprising the lands southeast of the Grand and\r\nMoses coulees, bordering on the southwest on the Columbia river,\r\nwith Adams and Lincoln counties on its eastern border.\r\n\r\nEphrata is the county seat, on the Great Northern railway. The\r\nnorthern part of the county is traversed by the Great Northern\r\nrailroad, and has developed into a vast region of grain production\r\nwithout irrigation, although originally supposed to be valueless\r\nfor cereal-raising.\r\n\r\nThe southern part is new and comparatively undeveloped, but is\r\ncrossed by the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul railway, just now\r\ngiving this new county great impetus. The southern portion of the\r\ncounty has long been a grazing ground for herds of cattle and horses,\r\nbut it is thought now it will be turned into a prosperous region\r\nof small farms.\r\n\r\nWhile the county is cut by several coulees, it is chiefly composed\r\nof large areas of bench lands, comparatively level, barring a range\r\nof hills in its southwestern corner called Saddle mountains. There\r\nis considerable water in the county, Moses lake being quite a large\r\nbody of water with bordering swampy lands, about in the center,\r\nand Wilson creek, in the northern and Crab creek, in the southern\r\npart, furnishing considerable stock water.\r\n\r\nLANDS.\r\n\r\nThe lands tributary to the Great Northern railway already produce\r\ngreat quantities of grain and livestock, and these will continue\r\nto be its staple crops until irrigation may come in and stimulate\r\nfruit production, for which it is thought much of the lands will\r\nbe suitable.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nBoth the Great Northern and Northern Pacific railway systems are in\r\nthe grain fields of the northern part of the county. The Milwaukee\r\nroad crosses the southern part, the N. & S. is projected along its\r\nwestern border, paralleling the Columbia river, which is navigable,\r\nthus affording all the county, excepting the central portion, good\r\nfacilities for marketing its products. As the county develops,\r\nbeyond question branch lines will penetrate this portion, and Grant\r\ncounty will become as well supplied as any other portion of the\r\nstate with facilities for commerce.\r\n\r\nCITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nEPHRATA, the county seat, is a small village on the Great Northern\r\nrailway about midway of the county and the center of a large\r\nwheat-growing section. Its transformation into an important town\r\nis rapidly\r\n[Page 60]\r\ngoing on, the new county government calling for a variety of new\r\noccupations to center here.\r\n\r\nWILSON CREEK, near the eastern border of the county, is a larger\r\ntown whose chief industry is marketing grain. It is an important\r\ndistributing point, with prospects of larger growth.\r\n\r\nQUINCY is a station on the Great Northern and is also an important\r\nwheat-shipping point.\r\n\r\nSOAP LAKE, on a lake of the same name, is noted as a resort for\r\nthe rheumatic.\r\n\r\nBACON, COULEE CITY, and HARTLINE are stations on the Northern Pacific\r\nrailway in the northeastern part of the county.\r\n\r\nGrant county is new, but has large undeveloped resources, and is\r\nawaiting the newcomer with abundant offerings for his energy and\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\n\r\nISLAND COUNTY\r\n\r\nIsland county is entirely composed of a group of islands in Puget\r\nsound, the largest two being Whidby and Camano. It has a land area\r\nof 227 square miles and a population of about 5,000.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nLumber, agricultural products and fish make up the county's resources.\r\nConsiderable of the timber, particularly from Whidby island, has been\r\nremoved, and wheat, oats, hay, potatoes, fruits, poultry, butter,\r\neggs, etc., are now shipped out to the splendid nearby markets at\r\nthe chief seaport towns on Puget Sound.\r\n\r\nThe soils in the northern part of Whidby island are of remarkable\r\nfertility, some of them producing as much as 100 bushels of wheat\r\nper acre and immense crops of potatoes.\r\n\r\nIn season the waters of the county abound in salmon and other salt\r\nwater fish, and many of the citizens of the county find profitable\r\nemployment in connection with the fishing industry.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL TOWNS.\r\n\r\nCOUPEVILLE is a town of some 400 people and the county seat, situated\r\non a beautiful bay in the northern part of Whidby island. It is\r\nchief distributing point for the county, has a sawmill, shingle\r\nmill, fruit-drying establishment, stores, churches, schools, a\r\nnewspaper, etc.\r\n\r\nOAK HARBOR, further north, is the center of a large farming and\r\nlogging district. Two canneries are in successful operation.\r\n\r\nUTSALADY, SAN DE FUCA, CAMANO, CLINTON, and LANGLEY are smaller\r\nvillages gradually becoming summer resorts for people from the\r\nlarge cities of the sound. Steamboats furnish good transportation\r\nfrom all parts of the county.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 53.--An Okanogan County Orchard in Bloom.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 54.--A View of the Country Along the Okanogan\r\nRiver in the Vicinity of the Okanogan Irrigation Project.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 61]\r\nJEFFERSON COUNTY\r\n\r\nJefferson county is the second county south of the entrance of\r\nPuget sound, stretching from the Pacific ocean eastward over the\r\npeaks of the Olympic mountains to Hood's canal, and turning north\r\ngets a long waterfront also on Puget sound, and taps the Straits\r\nof Fuca. It has a population of 11,000 people and 2,000 square\r\nmiles of territory.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nThe resources of this county are largely undeveloped, and yet it\r\nis one of the oldest settled counties in the state. Originally its\r\nentire area, barring a few small patches, was heavily timbered,\r\nand it is estimated that the county still has twenty billion feet of\r\nstanding timber. Its soil is remarkably fertile, and the products\r\nof its farms have long been famous.\r\n\r\nThe Olympic mountains contain veins of precious metals, iron and\r\nmanganese, none of which have as yet been thoroughly developed.\r\n\r\nFishing for salmon, sardines, shrimps, clams and crabs is a very\r\nimportant industry.\r\n\r\nSOILS, CLIMATE AND PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nThe soils of the county are largely sedimentary, having been washed\r\ndown from the mountains for ages, assisted by the decomposition of\r\nvegetable matter accumulated through centuries. In the valleys, where\r\nmost of the farming is being done, these soils produce remarkable\r\ncrops under the influence of the charming climate the county affords.\r\n\r\nThe rainfall in the eastern part of the county is moderate, but\r\nample for all purposes; the average rainfall is about 20 inches.\r\nThe temperature rarely exceeds 80 degrees in summer, while the\r\nwinter months average about 45 degrees.\r\n\r\nSuch soils and such climatic conditions combine to force wealth\r\nupon every industrious tiller of the soil. Clover yields from four\r\nto six tons per acre.\r\n\r\nOats and vetches for ensilage purposes yield five to seven tons\r\nper acre. Fifty to seventy-five tons of cabbage or mangles per\r\nacre are not uncommon, and onions and potatoes produce from six\r\nto ten tons. The fruit trees, particularly cherries, apples, and\r\npears, produce wonderful crops. Cattle can graze ten months in the\r\nyear or more, and the products of the dairies of Jefferson county\r\ncannot be excelled.\r\n\r\nBecause of the light rainfall and moderate weather, this county is\r\nadmirably suited to poultry-raising. Green food can be had twelve\r\nmonths in the year. Runs can always be open, and with proper care\r\nhens can be made to pay $3.00 per year each.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nPORT TOWNSEND, at the entrance of Puget sound, is the county seat\r\nand chief commercial center of the county. It has a population of\r\n[Page 62]\r\nabout 6,000. It is the headquarters for many government institutions,\r\nincluding the U. S. customs service, U. S. revenue cutter service,\r\nmarine hospital service, hydrographic service, quarantine service,\r\nand U. S. artillery for the Puget sound district.\r\n\r\nThree great forts; Worden, Flagler, and Casey, are located here,\r\nforming the chief defense to Puget sound. Fort Worden joins the\r\ncity limits. The present garrison force is 2,000. The scenery from\r\nthe city is grand and beyond compare.\r\n\r\nIts business interests are varied and extensive. Two canneries\r\nfor salmon and sardines are here located, boiler works, a machine\r\nshop for building electric and gasoline engines, a shipyard, sash\r\nand door factory, lumber mills, and shingle mills, a by-product\r\nplant producing wood alcohol, turpentine, etc.\r\n\r\nThe city is substantially built and its homes are artistically created.\r\n\r\nThe harbor has twenty-five miles of waterfront and fine anchorage\r\nof from nine to eighteen fathoms, and is an ideal refuge for all\r\nseagoing craft.\r\n\r\nThe city has gas and electric lights, paid fire department, fine\r\nchurches, splendid schools, and a magnificent gravity water system\r\nfurnishes the town of Irondale, Hadlock and Forts Worden and Flagler,\r\nhaving plenty of water to spare for thousands mote.\r\n\r\nIRONDALE is practically a suburb of Port Townsend, having the only\r\npig iron plant in the state. It is an extensive and growing concern,\r\nusing bog iron from the vicinity and other ores from different\r\nsources.\r\n\r\nPORT LUDLOW, DUCKABUSH, BOGACHIEL, PORT DISCOVERY, QUILCENE, and\r\nCHIMACUM are small villages scattered about the county and are\r\ncenters of agricultural activity.\r\n\r\n\r\nKING COUNTY\r\n\r\nKing county is distinguished by having Seattle for its county seat.\r\nThe county is an empire in itself, stretching from the shores of\r\nPuget sound to the peaks of the Cascade mountains, and containing\r\nmore than 2,000 square miles of territory. It also includes Vashon,\r\none of the large islands of the sound.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nKing county's sources of revenue are varied and extensive. Its\r\nlumber industry, growing out of the vast forests within its borders\r\nnot only, but from the cutting of logs brought in from other sections\r\nof the state, is immense.\r\n\r\nIts agricultural lands are not surpassed in fertility by any, and\r\ninclude not only the alluvial deposits in its river bottoms, but\r\ngreat areas of shot clay and other soils splendidly adapted to\r\nfruit culture.\r\n\r\nIts mining industries include not only very great acreage of coal\r\nmeasures, which have been producing coal for commercial purposes for\r\nlocal and foreign trade for thirty years and are scarcely scratched\r\nas yet, but also fissure veins of the precious metals--gold, silver, lead,\r\n[Page 63]\r\ncopper, antimony, arsenic, and also iron, asbestos, fire clays,\r\nkaolin, granite, sandstones, lime ledges, and others.\r\n\r\nIts fishing industries in its own waters and from the ocean give\r\nemployment to a large number of men and its fish are shipped even\r\nas far east as Boston, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nIts power capacity, in addition to its wood and coal, includes\r\ngreat falls and rapids and many large streams which are already\r\nharnessed, but only in part, and driving vast quantities of machinery\r\nin this and adjoining counties.\r\n\r\nIn commercial possibilities King county is unrivaled. Its combination\r\nof lakes, rivers and salt water harbors have no superior on the\r\nglobe, and the fact of its supremacy is demonstrated by the tabulated\r\nstatistics of state officers, which show that King county possesses\r\none-fifth of the population of the state and has more than one-quarter\r\nin value of taxable property of the state, and pays one-fourth of\r\ntaxes collected within the state borders.\r\n\r\nIn scenery, which is no mean asset of the county, it is also\r\nunsurpassed. Vast ranges of mountains, sheets of fresh and salt\r\nwater, rivers, hills and plains, forests, and grassy fields combine\r\nand interlace in a thousand directions to entrance and delight\r\nthe artistic eye.\r\n\r\nIn game, including bear, deer, mountain goats, cougar, grouse,\r\npheasants, quail, mountain trout, salmon and other fishes, make\r\nmany a paradise for the sportsman.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its salt waterways, with 75 miles of shore lands,\r\nand its navigable fresh water lakes, there are centering in the\r\ncounty coming in from all directions seven transcontinental lines of\r\nrailroads, making King county and its metropolis a great distributing\r\ncenter for the commerce between the American continent and the\r\ncontinents of Asia and the islands of the Pacific. Besides these\r\nsteam roads, electric trolley lines are making a network of\r\ninter-communication between all parts of King county not only, but\r\nreaching out into the adjoining counties.\r\n\r\nCITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nSEATTLE is the county seat and great metropolis of King county and\r\nthe state, with a population crowding, if not exceeding, 275,000\r\npeople. It covers the hills and lowlands surrounding Elliot bay, an\r\nindentation of Puget sound, and a part of the land between the sound\r\nand Lake Washington, a freshwater lake of great beauty paralleling\r\nthe sound for 23 miles and from one to three miles wide. It also\r\nincludes two smaller lakes, whose sloping shores are covered with\r\nthe homes of its citizens. From its hills the snow-capped mountains\r\nof the Cascade and Olympic ranges and Mount Rainier's towering\r\npeak are visions of surpassing beauty. A constant stream of coming\r\nand going water craft from all quarters of the globe frequent its\r\nharbor. Its business buildings of brick, stone, iron and concrete\r\ntower heavenward over four avenues, and many cross streets and\r\nmiles of its low lands are\r\n[Page 64]\r\ncovered with railroad tracks, warehouses and manufacturing plants.\r\n\r\nIts grammar schools, high schools, and State University are equipped\r\nwith magnificent buildings and grounds. Its streets and homes are\r\nbrilliantly lighted with electricity from its own power plants,\r\nwhile the purest water, sufficient for a million people, flows\r\nthrough its water mains, all owned and controlled by the city.\r\n\r\nA multitude of factories are providing a small part of the merchandise\r\nand composes the groundwork of her commerce.\r\n\r\nThe shores of Elliot bay are lined with wharves accommodating the\r\nlargest sea-going ships. Its last assessed valuation of property\r\nwas $203,168,680, and its tax to be raised $975,210.\r\n\r\nMore than 150 miles of street-car tracks are within her borders\r\nand a nickel pays for a 15-mile ride.\r\n\r\nGEORGETOWN, in the southern part of Seattle, but not a part of\r\nit as yet, has a population of about 5,000, and is an important\r\nmanufacturing center. Here are the car shops of Seattle Electric\r\nCompany, gas works, foundries, breweries, machine shops, brick\r\nand tile works and many other industries.\r\n\r\nRENTON, ISSAQUAH, RAVENSDALE, BLACK DIAMOND, and NEW CASTLE are\r\ncoal mining towns.\r\n\r\nKENT, AUBURN, KIRKLAND, VASHON, NORTH BEND, TOLT, FALL CITY, and\r\nMAPLE VALLEY are agricultural towns of importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nKITSAP COUNTY\r\n\r\nKitsap county is nearly surrounded by the waters of Puget sound\r\nand Hood's canal, forming the larger part of the great peninsula\r\nwhich these waters would make an island were a six-mile ridge in\r\nMason county opened up to them. It has extensive and numerous bays\r\nand inlets, with magnificent anchorage, and contains in its center\r\nthe great Port Orchard navy yard, destined to become one of the\r\nlargest seats in the United States for Uncle Sam's naval activities.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES AND INDUSTRIES.\r\n\r\nThe chief resource of the county is in the lumber. Some of the largest\r\nmills of the state are located within its borders.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that there are yet 200,000 acres of uncut timber in\r\nits borders, and its mills are turning out 600,000 feet of lumber\r\ndaily, besides vast quantities of shingles.\r\n\r\nThe fishing industry now includes oyster culture, which is rapidly\r\nbecoming very important. About the county are located many villages\r\nsupported by the tillage of the soil from its reclaimed forest\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nKitsap county has no railroads, but its waterways are so vast and\r\nintricate that all its corners are reached by steamers, and travel\r\nis cheap and freight conveniently handled in all parts of the county.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 55.--An Okanogan County Valley, Palmer\r\nLake.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 56.--McGowan Seining Grounds, Sand Island,\r\nPacific County.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 57.--Oyster Culture in Willapa Harbor,\r\nPacific County.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 58.--View of the Waterfront at Raymond,\r\nPacific County.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 59.--A View of a Portion of Tacoma's Harbor,\r\nShowing Ships Waiting to Load Lumber and Wheat for Foreign Ports.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 60.--Railroad Yards and a Corner of the\r\nBusiness Section, Tacoma.]\r\n\r\n[Page 65]\r\nPRINCIPAL TOWNS.\r\n\r\nPORT ORCHARD, the county seat, is on the bay of the same name and\r\nopposite the navy yard. It is the chief distributing point for a\r\nlarger part of the cultivated lands of the county, and exports not\r\nonly agricultural products, but also shingles. The surrounding lands\r\nare well suited for dairying, fruit-growing and poultry-raising,\r\nwhich is also true of the entire county.\r\n\r\nBREMERTON, adjoining the navy yard, is the largest town in the\r\ncounty, having about 4,000 people and rapidly growing. It has a\r\nfire department, electric light and water systems, newspapers,\r\nbanks, about 1,000 or more wage-earners and is a hustling town.\r\n\r\nCHARLESTON is another smaller town adjoining the navy yard on the\r\nwest and rapidly growing.\r\n\r\nPORT BLAKELEY is an important milling and shipbuilding town of\r\nnearly 2,000 people, opposite Seattle. Its lumber goes to all parts\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nPORT GAMBLE is a sawmill town of importance contributing to swell\r\nthe large output of lumber shipped out of the county.\r\n\r\nCHICO, TRACYTON, KEYPORT, PAULSBO, SEABECK, CRYSTAL SPRINGS, COLBY,\r\nBANGOR, BURLEY, PORT MADISON, and OLALLA are all small villages,\r\nmaking progress as agricultural centers and as furnishing summer\r\nhomes for business men.\r\n\r\n\r\nKITTITAS COUNTY\r\n\r\nKittitas county is located about in the center of the state, and\r\ntakes in the upper reaches and most of the watershed of the Yakima\r\nriver. It has a population of about 20,000 in an area of 2,400\r\nsquare miles. On its northwestern side it is bordered by two ranges\r\nof the Cascade mountains, while its southwestern side lies on the\r\nColumbia river.\r\n\r\nAmong the sources of the Yakima river are three large lakes, Keechelus,\r\nKachess and Cle-Elum, most beautiful bodies of mountain water and\r\nthe sources of the great irrigation systems now fathered by the\r\nnational government and making the Yakima valley a veritable garden\r\npot of orchards and vegetables, grasses and flowers.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nThe central portion of the county is a valley comprising 250,000\r\nacres, about one-fourth of which is under irrigation, and has long\r\nbeen noted for its prolific crops of hay and many herds of dairy\r\ncows.\r\n\r\nThe foothills of the mountains have precious metals, coal and iron.\r\nThe streams abound in trout and much game is in the mountains.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Pacific and Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul railroads,\r\ncoming into the county from the south and west, cross at Ellensburg\r\n[Page 66]\r\nand then follow the valley of the Yakima to the crest of the Cascades\r\ngiving abundant facilities for making markets east and west to all\r\nparts of the country.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL TOWNS.\r\n\r\nELLENSBURG, the county seat, is situated on a level bench in the\r\nYakima valley and on the railroads. It is a town of upwards of 5,500\r\npeople, and is substantially built, chiefly of brick. There are\r\ncreameries, flourmills, sawmills, and warehouses, banks, breweries\r\nnewspapers, electric lights, and gravity water system, churches,\r\nschools, among which is one of the state normal schools. It is\r\nalso a division point on the Northern Pacific railway, and is the\r\nchief distributing point in the county for farm products and\r\nmerchandise.\r\n\r\nROSLYN is the chief coal-mining town, situated on the railroad well\r\nup in the foothills of the mountains. It has about 4,500 people.\r\nIt has gravity water and electric lights, and is a substantial,\r\nthriving and growing town. From the coal mines in the vicinity the\r\nbest coals of the state are mined in large quantities and shipped\r\nall over the state.\r\n\r\nCLE_ELUM is another coal mining town, on the Northern Pacific railway,\r\nwith a population of about 2,500. Tributary to Cle-Elum is a wide\r\nmining territory, for which it is the chief distributing point.\r\n\r\nTHORPE is a smaller village likely to develop into an important\r\ntrading point.\r\n\r\n\r\nKLICKTAT COUNTY\r\n\r\nKlickitat county is central among the southern tier of counties\r\nof the state, bordering 80 miles on the Columbia river, with an\r\naverage width of 20 miles. It has a population of about 14,000\r\nand an area of 1,800 square miles.\r\n\r\nThere is a great variety in its climate, the elevation varying from\r\n100 to 3,500 feet above the sea level.\r\n\r\nThe soil is chiefly volcanic ash, disintegrated basalt and alluvium.\r\nIt is deep and much of it sub-irrigated. The principal crops are\r\nwheat, barley, rye, oats, and corn.\r\n\r\nThe wheat lands yield from 15 to 40 bushels per acre.\r\n\r\nAmong the fruits raised are apples, peaches, pears, cherries, English\r\nwalnuts, almonds, plums, prunes, grapes, apricots, and all the\r\nsmall fruits.\r\n\r\nWheat lands vary in price from $10 to $50 per acre. It is estimated\r\nthat 7,000 acres will be planted to fruit and nut trees this current\r\nyear, while last year 75,385 apple trees, 14,675 peach trees, and\r\n17,345 grape vines were planted.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nAs already indicated, the strength of the county is in its soil\r\nand agriculture is its great source of wealth. Stock-raising is a\r\nchief industry, the slopes of the mountains on its northern boundary\r\nfurnishing\r\n[Page 67]\r\nabundant pasturage. The southeastern part is fast developing into\r\na fruit-growing region, while agriculture and grain-growing is\r\nmore general in the central and southern portion.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nThe Columbia river, with a railroad on each side of it and numerous\r\nferries, makes ample provision for transportation, while the Goldendale\r\nbranch reaches well up into the center of the county.\r\n\r\nCITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nGOLDENDALE, the county seat and metropolis, is located in the center\r\nof the county, 120 miles east of Portland. It is the terminus of\r\nthe Goldendale branch of the Spokane, Portland & Seattle railway,\r\nmaking connection with the main line at Lyle. It is located in\r\nthe heart of a splendid agricultural section and at the edge of\r\nthe great timber belt.\r\n\r\nWHITE SALMON, located in the splendid fruit section, is a thriving\r\ntown. It is an important railroad point on the North Bank and is the\r\noutlet for the products of an extensive fruit, timber and dairying\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nCLIFFS, the division point of the Spokane, Portland & Seattle railway,\r\nis the trading center of many square miles of territory. The best\r\nnut land in the county is located near here.\r\n\r\nBICKLETON, the trading point of an extensive wheat section, is in\r\nthe eastern part of the county. An electric road has been surveyed,\r\nwhich will, when completed, give this town railway connection.\r\n\r\nLYLE, ROOSEVELT, COLUMBUS, BINGEN, and CENTERVILLE are growing trading\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEWIS COUNTY\r\n\r\nLewis county is one of the largest counties in western Washington,\r\nhaving an area of 2,593 square miles of territory and about 40,000\r\npeople. It occupies a large part of the drainage basins of two\r\nlarge rivers, the Cowlitz and Chehalis--one emptying its waters\r\ninto the Columbia river and the other into Grays harbor. It reaches\r\nfrom the peaks of the Cascades 100 miles toward the ocean, but\r\nis cut off 30 miles from the coast, and is about 30 miles wide.\r\nMount Rainier is just north of its extreme eastern portion and\r\nabout one-fourth of the county is within the Rainier forest reserve.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nAt present the chief industry of the county consists of manufacturing\r\nits forests into the various forms of lumber and its products, the\r\nlumber cut aggregating four hundred million feet and two hundred\r\nmillion shingles.\r\n\r\nNext in importance probably are the precious metal and coal deposits\r\nof the county, which have, however, been but little developed.\r\nThe coal measures include bituminous, lignite and anthracite, and\r\nare of great extent in the foothills of the eastern part of the\r\ncounty. Two systems of railroads have been projected into these\r\nfields, and the nearest, carrying lignite and bituminous coals,\r\nare being commercially developed.\r\n[Page 68]\r\n\r\nAgriculture, including especially dairying and fruit culture, takes\r\nthe place of the forests as they are removed and bids fair to reach\r\nin importance, in time, the lumber and coal resources. To this\r\nend, the soil fertility, the mild climate and cool mountain waters\r\nconspire.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nLewis county is in the path of all railroads coming in from the\r\nsouth or through the Columbia gap in the Cascades. Already the\r\nNorthern Pacific railway and the Union Pacific railway cross the\r\ncounty, and the North Coast contemplates traversing the entire\r\nCowlitz valley, while the Tacoma Eastern is already into the\r\nnorthwestern part of the county on its way toward the same goal.\r\nThe county cannot be too well supplied, for its vast treasures\r\nwhen developed will furnish immense products for transportation.\r\n\r\nCITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nCHEHALIS and CENTRALIA are the two twin cities of the county--less\r\nthan five miles apart and of about equal importance. From Chehalis\r\nthe Northern Pacific railway branches off, following the upper\r\nreaches of Chehalis river and ending on Willapa bay, while from\r\nCentralia the same road branches, following the lower Chehalis\r\nriver, to Grays harbor.\r\n\r\nCHEHALIS is the county seat, with a population of 5,000 and rapidly\r\ngrowing, and has electric lights, sanitary sewerage system, paved\r\nstreets, fine business blocks, and a large and growing trade. Near\r\nthe city is located the State Training School.\r\n\r\nCENTRALIA has a population of about 7,000 people, chiefly engaged\r\nin running sawmills, shingle mills, sash and door factories, and\r\nother woodworking plants. It has a large city hall, ten churches,\r\nfine schools, banks, business houses, water systems, fire department,\r\nand is a hustling, thriving town.\r\n\r\nWINLOCK is a town of 1,200 people on the railroad in the southern\r\npart of the county, and a distributing point of much importance.\r\n\r\nPE ELL is a town of 1,000 people on the South Bend branch of the\r\nNorthern Pacific railway, chiefly engaged in milling and agricultural\r\npursuits.\r\n\r\nMCCORMICK, LITTELL, KOSMOS, LITTLE FALLS, ADNA, DRYAD, DOTY, and\r\nKOPIAH, are all centers of industry in various parts of the county.\r\n\r\nLewis county as a whole offers wonderful opportunities for newcomers\r\nin all pursuits--commercial, agricultural, and mining.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 61.--Tacoma High School and Stadium. Rose\r\nArbor in Point Defiance Park, Tacoma.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 62.--A Red Raspberry Field in the Puyallup\r\nValley, Pierce County.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 69]\r\nLINCOLN COUNTY\r\n\r\nLincoln county, adjoining Spokane county on the west, is one of\r\neastern Washington's great granaries. Its northern boundary is\r\ndefined by the Columbia and Spokane rivers. The bulk of its lands\r\nare rolling prairies of great fertility. It has about 2,300 square\r\nmiles of territory and about 25,000 people.\r\n\r\nTOPOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the county consists of the rolling prairie land\r\ncharacteristic of the great wheat belt of the state. There are\r\nsome mineral lands in the northern part of the county and here\r\nand there will be found considerable stretches of timber. In its\r\nnorthern portion the county is well watered by the Columbia and\r\nSpokane rivers, while in the southwestern section and elsewhere\r\nnumerous small creeks and lakes occur.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nThe great resource of Lincoln county is its wheat fields, which\r\nin 1907 produced to exceed 8,000,000 bushels. Other cereals and\r\nhay are important crops. Along its northern part, particularly\r\non the bottom lands of the rivers, much fruit is grown, including\r\npeaches and all the small fruits. Diversified farming is growing\r\nin favor among the farmers. Compared with other counties of the\r\nstate, Lincoln county ranks as follows in the number of its stock:\r\nHorses, second place; hogs, second place; cattle, sixth place.\r\nThe county also stands fourth in the number of its school houses\r\nand spends annually $100,000 for school support.\r\n\r\nIn wealth per capita, Lincoln county leads the state, showing for\r\nassessment purposes an average holding of real estate of $1,163\r\nand $226 in personalty.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nThe county is traversed from west to east its entire length by the\r\nGreat Northern and the central Washington branch of the Northern\r\nPacific railroads, some distance from its side lines, so that very\r\nlittle of the county is more than 12 miles from a railroad shipping\r\npoint. There are 170 miles of railroad tracks in the county.\r\n\r\nCITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nDAVENPORT, the county seat and largest town in the county, is situated\r\non the central Washington branch of the Northern Pacific railway\r\nnear the middle eastern portion of the county, and has a population\r\nof about 2,800 people. Its business blocks are chiefly built of\r\nbrick. It owns its own water system, is lighted with electricity,\r\nhas fine school buildings and churches. Its court house cost about\r\n$80,000. It is surrounded by splendid farms and annually ships\r\nout about 1,250,000 bushels of wheat.\r\n\r\n[Page 70]\r\nWILBUR, a town of 1,500 people, on the Northern Pacific railway,\r\nis a very important shipping and distributing center. It has large\r\nflour mills, warehouses, five churches, and schools, electric lights,\r\nand water system, bank, newspaper, parks, and important commercial\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nALMIRA, in the western part of the county, on the Northern Pacific\r\nrailway, is another prosperous and growing grain center with about\r\n600 people.\r\n\r\nHARRINGTON, on the Great Northern railway, is a town of some 1,200\r\npeople. It has a beautiful location, commands the trade of a large\r\nfarming county, ships grain and livestock, and is a prosperous\r\nand growing town.\r\n\r\nCRESTON, EGYPT, and BLUESTEM are smaller growing commercial centers.\r\n\r\n\r\nMASON COUNTY\r\n\r\nMason county lies on the upper reaches of Puget sound, having the\r\nOlympic mountains at its north, where about one-fourth of the county\r\nis in the Olympic forest reserve. Its total area is about 900 square\r\nmiles, and it has a population of about 6,000. Hood's canal penetrates\r\nwell into the center of the county in its great bend, giving it a\r\nvery long salt-water shore line. From the Olympic mountains numerous\r\nstreams flow into the Puget sound, while others empty their waters\r\ninto Gray's harbor.\r\n\r\nThe county is a great forest of splendid timber, which has been\r\nonly to a limited degree cut out. The soil of the foothills and\r\nvalleys Is composed chiefly of shot clays and alluvial deposits,\r\nmaking good farming, stock-raising and fruit-growing lands.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nLogging and its allied industries constitute the main industries\r\nof the county, Much of the logs are shipped out of the county to\r\nfeed sawmills in other parts of the Sound.\r\n\r\nRaising and marketing oysters is an important source of wealth to\r\nthe county.\r\n\r\nThere is already considerable acreage for farming and stock-raising,\r\nstock finding pasturage the year round. This industry will grow\r\nas the land is cleared.\r\n\r\nThe county affords splendid hunting and fishing in season.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nThe county is so cut into by the inlets and bays of the sound that\r\nit has splendid transportation facilities by steamer to all the\r\nsound ports. The Northern Pacific railway reaches its southern\r\nboundary. No other railroads traverse the county but its logging\r\nrailroads, which can give only a limited service.\r\n\r\n[Page 71]\r\nPRINCIPAL TOWNS.\r\n\r\nSHELTON is the county seat, situated on an arm of the sound at the\r\nterminus of the logging railroad, and has about 1,200 inhabitants.\r\nSteamers from its wharves reach all the parts of the sound directly\r\nor by connection with others.\r\n\r\nThe logging industry, manufacturing lumber, cultivating oysters,\r\nfishing and farming are the chief industries of its people. It has\r\nfour churches, good schools, a newspaper, good stocks of goods,\r\nvolunteer fire department, electric lights, gravity water system.\r\n\r\nThe logging industry, which centers here, employs 2,000 men and\r\npays out $120,000 a month.\r\n\r\nLAKE CUSHMAN is a summer resort in the mountains famous for its\r\nbig trout catches.\r\n\r\nALLYN, on an arm of the sound, is central to much oyster lands,\r\nlogging camps and fruit orchards.\r\n\r\nARCADIA, also on the sound, is central to considerable stock-raising\r\nand lumbering.\r\n\r\nDETROIT is a prosperous village, proud of the grapes grown on some\r\nof its logged-off lands.\r\n\r\nMATLOCK is a town on the logging railroad and central to large logging\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n\r\nOKANOGAN COUNTY.\r\n\r\nOkanogan, the largest county in the state, lies on the northern\r\nboundary just east of the Cascade peaks. It has an area of 4,500\r\nsquare miles and a population estimated at 13,000.\r\n\r\nAbout one-fourth of the county, a district of great latent resources,\r\nis still within the Colville Indian reservation, but is soon to\r\nbe thrown open to settlement.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nThis county is endowed with great natural resources and a delightful\r\nclimate, and is destined to become thickly populated.\r\n\r\nThe mountains and their foothills have large and numerous veins\r\nof metals and are covered also with extensive forests. The rolling\r\nhills of the south and center are rich in agricultural possibilities,\r\nsuitable for stock, and great crops of cereals and fruits. The\r\nOkanogan river and its branches drain the greater portion of the\r\ncounty, rising in British Columbia and flowing south through the\r\ncenter of the county and joining the Columbia river on the south\r\nboundary. The Methow river drains a large portion of the western\r\npart and makes a paradise for the frontiersman along its sloping\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nUntil now the rivers and wagon roads are the only paths of commerce.\r\nBut into this blossoming empire the railroads are looking with\r\nlonging eyes. The Great Northern, however, has already tapped the\r\n[Page 72]\r\nnorthern boundary and projected a line down the Okanogan and Columbia\r\nrivers to Wenatchee. Other railroads will follow, as the prize is\r\ntoo great not to be divided.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL TOWNS.\r\n\r\nCONCONULLY, the county seat, is situated among the foothills and\r\nmines west of the Okanogan river. In addition to the mining industry,\r\nthe raising of sheep and cattle is followed by the citizens. The\r\ntown has a population of about 500 people.\r\n\r\nOROVILLE is the chief town on the railroad, near the northern border,\r\nand is the terminus of the road. It has about 500 people and is\r\ngrowing. It is an important ore-shipping point, surrounded also\r\nby good fruit-raising and agricultural lands, yet unirrigated.\r\n\r\nBREWSTER, at the junction of the Columbia and Okanogan rivers,\r\nhas a population of about 200, and is an important grain and\r\nfruit-shipping point.\r\n\r\nOKANOGAN is on the river of the same name, about midway between\r\nBrewster and Conconully, and to this point the steamers ply in\r\nthe higher waters of the river.\r\n\r\nTWISP is a growing village in the Methow valley, devoted chiefly to\r\nfruit-growing and mining. It is an important distributing center.\r\n\r\nPATEROS has steamer connection with Wenatchee, and is an importing,\r\ngrowing center.\r\n\r\nBECK, BONAPARTE, ANGLIN and BODIE are other new and growing commercial\r\ncenters.\r\n\r\nCHESAW, in the northern part, and NESPELIM, in the southeastern\r\npart, are important locations.\r\n\r\n\r\nPACIFIC COUNTY.\r\n\r\nPacific county is the extreme southern county, which borders on the\r\nocean at the mouth of the Columbia river. Although a small county\r\nwith only 900 square miles, it has about 100 miles of salt-water\r\nfrontage. Willapa harbor, at the northwest, is capable of being\r\nmade accessible to all ocean ships, while Shoalwater bay, a body\r\nof water 20 miles long and separated from the ocean by a long slim\r\npeninsula, furnishes probably the best breeding ground In the state\r\nfor oyster culture. The county at large is an immense forest, in\r\nthe center of which is a range of hills dividing the watershed so\r\nthat some of the streams flow into the Columbia river at the south,\r\nsome west into Willapa harbor, and others, through the Chehalis\r\nriver, reach Grays harbor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 63.--Modern Sanitary Dairy Barn, on Farm\r\nof Hon.

A splendid market for all farm\r\nproducts is afforded by the mills and lumber camps and summer campers\r\non the beach.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Pacific railway reaches Willapa harbor, cutting the\r\ncounty centrally east and west. On the long ocean beach from the\r\nmouth of the Columbia river northward is a railroad about 20 miles\r\nlong, made profitable by the extensive patronage of the summer\r\ncampers. Added to these are the water crafts which frequent the\r\nharbor and the Columbia river, and altogether make access to all\r\nparts of the county easy.\r\n\r\nCITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nSOUTH BEND, the county seat, situated near the mouth of the Willapa\r\nriver, is a rapidly growing town of 3,000 people and destined to become\r\nan important ocean port. The harbor is capacious, well protected,\r\nhas fine anchorage, and is handicapped only by a few feet of mud at\r\nthe bottom, which Uncle Sam will soon remove. At low tide there\r\nis now from 20 to 30 feet of water in the channel of the river and\r\nat South Bend it is 1,000 feet wide. South Bend is the terminus\r\nof the Northern Pacific railway. It has electric lights, water\r\nworks, good schools, fine churches, bank, sawmills, planing-mills,\r\nsash and door factories, fish canneries, newspapers, etc., and\r\nis about to build a $50,000 courthouse.\r\n\r\nRAYMOND, a new manufacturing town on the harbor and railroad, a\r\nfew miles from South Bend, has 2,500 people and is rapidly growing\r\nin importance. Raymond is not yet five years old; has a monthly\r\npayroll of $100,000; sawmills and factories representing an invested\r\ncapital of $4,900,000, employing 1,200 men; an electric light plant;\r\na city telephone system, owned by local capital; a salt-water fire\r\nprotection system; is about to build two bridges, costing $30,000\r\neach, and is adding new manufacturing plants at the rate of one a\r\nmonth. The city gives free factory sites, and has both rail and\r\nocean transportation from factory locations to the markets of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nILWACO is a fishing post of importance near the southwest shore\r\nof the county, with 900 population.\r\n\r\nCHINOOK, FRANKFORT and KNABTON are other fishing points on the\r\nColumbia river of importance. NAHCOTTA is an ocean summer resort.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 74]\r\nPIERCE COUNTY.\r\n\r\nPierce county, though not the largest, is one of the most important\r\ncounties in the state. Its area of 1,800 square miles occupies\r\nmuch of the upper reaches of Puget sound on both sides and extends\r\nsoutheasterly, taking in the Rainier National Park of 2,225,000\r\nacres, and Mount Rainier (Tacoma) 14,526 feet above sea level and\r\nless than 60 miles from salt water, covered with eternal snow, an\r\nendless scene of majestic grandeur, giving the county a greater\r\nvariety of elevations and more beautiful and startling scenery than\r\nany other county in the United States. Its northeastern boundary\r\nis the White river, its southwestern boundary the Nisqually river.\r\nIt has about 125 miles of salt-water shore lands, with innumerable\r\nbays and inlets and several important islands. Originally one vast\r\nforest, much of it now is covered with fruitful fields of grain,\r\ngrass and orchards.\r\n\r\nIts climate is mild and salubrious, its soils of great variety\r\nand fertility, and its mountains and foothills full of coal and\r\nprecious metals.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nThe resources of Pierce county are varied and of great value. Its\r\ncentral part is one great coal field, covered with forests, producing\r\nannually about 1,000,000 tons of coal. Gold, silver and copper are\r\namong its precious metals, but not extensively mined as yet.\r\n\r\nIts rivers possess almost immeasurable water power. One plant on\r\nthe Puyallup river at Electron has an ultimate capacity of 40,000\r\nhorse-power, 20,000 horse-power of which is now in use. The city of\r\nTacoma is engaged in the construction of a plant on the Nisqually\r\nfor municipal use, the capacity of which will be 20,000 horse-power.\r\nThe 12,000 horse-power plant at Snoqualmie Falls also furnishes\r\ncurrent for city lighting, street railway and manufacturing purposes\r\nin Tacoma.\r\n\r\nAll the cereals are successfully raised; dairying is one of the\r\nmost important industries; fruit-growing, particularly in small\r\nfruits, such as strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, cherries,\r\netc., is very profitable and is engaging a great deal of attention.\r\nFish are caught in quantities and shipped to eastern markets, but\r\nPierce county's greatest natural wealth is in its vast forests.\r\nAn idea of the value can be had when it is said that $6,000,000\r\nworth of lumber was cut in 1908 in Tacoma alone. In addition to\r\nthese great natural resources, Pierce county's commercial industries\r\nare so great as to place it in the front rank of counties of the\r\nNorthwest. The great sawmills, woodworking plants and factories of\r\nvarious kinds in the city of Tacoma alone employ 11,800 people, and\r\nthe value of their output last year amounted to over $43,000,000.00.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nPierce county is fast becoming a network of transcontinental railroads\r\ncentering in Tacoma, which, coupled with the steamboat traffic on\r\nthe Sound, gives the county splendid traffic facilities. Pierce county\r\n[Page 75]\r\nfor years was a non-competitive railroad point, the Northern Pacific\r\nbeing the only road to enter its vast fields of wealth. Within the\r\nlast two years, however, the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, the\r\nUnion Pacific system, and the Great Northern, realizing the wealth\r\nof the county and the importance of Tacoma as a manufacturing center,\r\nthe value of her perfect harbor for shipping, the vastness of her\r\ngreat stretch of level tidelands for factory sites and terminal\r\nyards, and the low cost at which freight can be transferred from the\r\nrails to the sails or _vice versa_, have entered the field and are\r\nnow spending $11,000,000 on construction and terminal work in the\r\ncity of Tacoma. The addition of these new roads means a wonderful\r\nimpetus to the trade of Tacoma. The Tacoma Eastern railroad, a\r\nbeautiful scenic route, beginning at Tacoma, runs in a southeasterly\r\ndirection through a wonderfully fertile country and vast forests\r\nof splendid timber, to Rainier National Park and Mount Rainier\r\n(Mt. Tacoma). Several trolley lines are in operation, reaching all\r\nthe near-by towns and connecting Tacoma and Seattle.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these lines, many steamboats and crafts of all kinds,\r\nplying the waters of Puget Sound and the Pacific ocean, find abundant\r\nwharfage and anchorage in the harbor of Tacoma. The products of\r\nthe world in large quantities pass through Tacoma in process of\r\ndistribution. A constant stream of small crafts, running about\r\nthe waters of the county, accommodate the local traffic.\r\n\r\nCITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nTACOMA, with a population of about 125,000, is the county seat of\r\nPierce county, and situated on Commencement bay. Its harbor, one\r\nof the finest in the world, and its railroad terminals, unexcelled\r\non the Pacific Coast, as already indicated, are the center of a\r\nvast commerce by rail and water. At its door is an immense amount\r\nof water power, already developed, driving her street cars and the\r\nmachinery in many of her factories. Coal and coke are in abundance\r\nwithin a few miles of the city, the coal being used extensively\r\nfor steam and conveyed from the trains to the boats by immense\r\nelectric bunkers. The coke is largely utilized in the largest lead\r\nand copper reduction plant on the coast. The great Guggenheim smelter\r\nat Tacoma reduces and turns out annually lead, copper, gold and silver\r\nworth about $10,000,000. Along her wharves are immense elevators,\r\ngrain warehouses and flouring mills. Tacoma yearly ships out more\r\ngrain than any other city on Puget sound. In and around the city\r\nare large saw and shingle mills, which last year cut 527,604,000\r\nfeet of lumber and 434,000,000 Shingles. Her factories and shops\r\nhave $24,000,000 invested and employ 11,800 wage-earners, and her\r\nlarge flour mills ship their products to all parts of the world.\r\nHer packing-house products amounted to $5,000,000 in 1908. The\r\nlargest car shops west of the Mississippi are located here. Her\r\ndowntown streets are lined by large business blocks; she has 185\r\nmiles of street and suburban railway, and over 75 miles of paved\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\n[Page 76]\r\nThere are four daily newspapers, 8 banks, 1,120 acres in parks,\r\nand many beautiful and expensive public buildings. The city hall\r\ncost $200,000; the court house, $500,000; her high school building,\r\nthe most beautiful on the coast, cost a half million dollars, and the\r\nUnited States government is completing a $500,000 federal building.\r\n\r\nPUYALLUP is one of Pierce county's prosperous towns, having about\r\n7,000 population, in the wealthy Puyallup valley. This is the center\r\nor a great fruit-growing district, in which the farmers have combined\r\nand market their crops through an association, sending their berries\r\nin patent refrigerator cars into far-away markets. It is also quite\r\na large manufacturing center, with a payroll of $45,000 per month.\r\n\r\nBUCKLEY, with a population of 1,500, is the center of large sawmilling,\r\nfarming and mining industries.\r\n\r\nORTING is a town with 800 people, chiefly engaged in gardening\r\nand farming. The State Soldiers' Home is located near, and adds\r\nconsiderable trade to the town.\r\n\r\nSUMNER has a population of 1,000, is located in the Puyallup valley,\r\nand its people form a part of the farmers' association, engaged\r\nin fruit-growing, dairying and gardening.\r\n\r\nSTEILACOOM is one of the most beautiful little summer resort towns\r\non Puget sound and is connected with Tacoma by two electric lines.\r\n\r\nSYLVAN, GIG HARBOR, ROSEDALE, ELGIN, LONG BRANCH, BLANCHARD, and\r\nBEE are very prosperous villages of Pierce county, and are located\r\non the shores of Puget sound.\r\n\r\nSPANAWAY, EATONVILLE, ALDERTON, ELBE, MERIDIAN, KAPOWSIN, and MCMILLAN\r\nare villages in the interior, on the railroads.\r\n\r\nWILKESON, SOUTH PRARIE, CARBONADO, FAIRFAX, PITTSBURG, and MELMONT\r\nare coal-mining towns of importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAN JUAN COUNTY.\r\n\r\nSan Juan county is a group of islands lying between the waters\r\nof the Straits of Fuca and the Gulf of Georgia, off the southeast\r\nshore of Vancouver island. It has about 200 square miles of territory\r\nand about 4,500 people.\r\n\r\nThere are three large islands and several smaller ones. The islands\r\nare covered with soil and timber not different from the main land\r\nadjoining. Heavy timber in the forests, fine clay loams in the\r\nbottom lands, shot clay on the hillsides, big ledges of lime rock\r\nand other minerals and great shoals of fish in the waters are the\r\nfoundations for prosperity for the citizens of the county.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nThe soils of the islands yield generously to good tillage, and\r\nwheat, oats, barley, potatoes and hay yield large crops. Dairying\r\nis profitable. Poultry-raising and fruit-growing, are especially\r\nattractive. Sheep and\r\n[Page 77]\r\ncattle find splendid pasture. Great quantities of salmon and other\r\nfish are taken in the waters, and game-deer and wild fowl--are\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 67.--Two Views of the Lime Works at Roche\r\nHarbor, San Juan County.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 68.--A Typical Farm Scene in Skagit County.]\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nThere is no transportation save by water, but the islands are in\r\nthe way of traffic from so many different directions that all parts\r\nare well served by steamboats.\r\n\r\nISLANDS AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nSAN JUAN ISLAND is the largest of the group, and its chief industries\r\nare farming, raising stock, salmon-fishing, and manufacturing lime.\r\n\r\nFRIDAY HARBOR, on this island, is the county seat and largest town,\r\nwith about 500 people. A telephone system is in operation throughout\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nROCHE HARBOR is the home of great lime kilns.\r\n\r\nORCAS ISLAND is the leading fruit-growing district of the county.\r\n\r\nEAST SOUND, near the center of the island, at the foot of Mount\r\nConstitution, is a picturesque and charming fruit-growing section\r\nand summer resort.\r\n\r\nORCAS is an important center of the fruit and sheep raising industries.\r\n\r\nLOPEZ ISLAND is a beautiful stretch of fertile agricultural land,\r\nmuch of it under tillage, and is the home of a prosperous community\r\nof farmers and stock-growers.\r\n\r\nLOPEZ is the chief commercial center, with a cannery and creamery.\r\n\r\n\r\nSKAGIT COUNTY.\r\n\r\nSkagit county is the next county to the northwest corner of the\r\nstate, stretching from Rosario straits to the peaks of the\r\nCascades--about 100 miles east and west and 24 miles north and\r\nsouth. Its area is 1,800 square miles, with a population of about\r\n35,000.\r\n\r\nIt is a county of great diversities in climate, topography and\r\nresources. The Skagit river and its branches drain nearly the entire\r\ncounty from the mountains to the saltwater. Its deltas are great\r\nflat fields of wonderful fertility. Its valleys also, where cleared\r\nof forests, are very rich alluvial lands. Its upper lands carry\r\na great burden of forests and are full of hidden treasures.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nThe resources of the county are its forests and minerals, its\r\nagricultural products, and fishes. Its great cereal crop is of\r\noats; hops, fruits, hay and barley follow in the order named in\r\nimportance, while the products of the dairy are rapidly multiplying.\r\nIts minerals include the precious metals, iron, lead, coal, marble,\r\nlimestone, granite, sandstone, etc.\r\n\r\n[Page 78]\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nAside from its water transportation, the Great Northern and the\r\nNorthern Pacific railways cross its westerly end and send a branch\r\nline through the valley of the Skagit river well up towards the\r\nmountains and to the salt water at Anacortes. And other roads are\r\nbuilding, while there are 168 miles of modern graveled wagon roads.\r\nThe facilities for getting about are excellent.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nMT. VERNON is the county seat, with about 4,000 people. It is on\r\nthe Great Northern railway, on the navigable Skagit river, and is\r\na city of much commercial importance to the agricultural district\r\naround it. The soil in the vicinity is renowned for its great fertility\r\nand astonishing crops of oats, hay and grass. Creameries and a\r\nmilk-condensing plant are supported profitably to all concerned.\r\n\r\nANACORTES is the chief town of the county, on the salt water. It\r\nhas about 6,000 people, and is a center of lumbering and fishing.\r\nFactories for drying, salting, and canning salmon, halibut, and\r\ncod are increasing industries. There is also a fertilizing plant\r\nand a plant producing charcoal and the by-products of combustion,\r\nwood alcohol, turpentine, etc.\r\n\r\nSEDRO-WOOLLEY, on both the Northern Pacific and Great Northern\r\nrailways, has a population of 4,000, engaged in lumber industries,\r\nfruit, and vegetables, canning, dairying and gardening. It has a\r\nmonthly payroll of $125,000.\r\n\r\nBURLINGTON, on the Great Northern railway, has 1,800 people, and\r\nfactories for making various wood products, concrete blocks, lumber,\r\nshingles and condensed milk.\r\n\r\nLA CONNER is a great oat and hay shipping point.

It is chiefly within the forest reserve, and includes Mount St.\r\nHelens on the west and Mount Adams on its eastern border. Altogether\r\nit has an area of 1,636 square miles, chiefly mountainous, and about\r\n3,000 people.\r\n\r\nThe north fork of the Lewis river drains the most of the mountainous\r\nregion, while a lot of small streams drain the southern part, emptying\r\ninto the Columbia river.\r\n\r\nThe climate is a mean between that of eastern and western Washington,\r\nand is very mild and salubrious. The soil of the valleys in the\r\nregion of the Columbia river is very fertile.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nThe chief resource of the county is in its timber and lumber, yet\r\nits mineral and agricultural wealth is becoming better known and\r\nappreciated yearly. The fruit raised in its valleys is of excellent\r\nflavor, early in season, and the soil is generous in its yield.\r\nSplendid pasturage in the foothills encourages stock-raising, and\r\nfishing in the Columbia river is profitably followed by some of\r\nthe citizens.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nBoats on the Columbia river and a railroad on each side of it are\r\nthe means of transportation, and ample for the residents of the\r\ncounty in its southern portion. The coming of the North Bank railroad\r\nhas given a decided stimulus to the growth of the county.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT.\r\n\r\nSkamania county has developed slowly and the bulk of its natural\r\nwealth is still practically untouched. Its minerals, well known\r\nto be valuable, are attracting the attention of prospectors, while\r\nthe forests, fisheries and farming lands will furnish a competence\r\nto hundreds of additional familles. The scenery, combined with\r\nthe fishing and hunting afforded, are additional attractions that\r\nwill prove alluring to many newcomers.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL TOWNS.\r\n\r\nSTEVENSON, a small town on the Columbia river and railroad, is the\r\ncounty seat and has a population of about 450.\r\n\r\nTributary to Stevenson is considerable improved land, and the people\r\nare engaged in stock-raising, fruit-growing and farming.\r\n\r\nBUTLER is a town of about 300 people on the railroad and river.\r\n\r\nCARSON, CAPE HORN, MT. PLEASANT and BEAR PRAIRIE are smaller villages,\r\ndestined to become centers of commercial distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 80]\r\nSNOHOMISH COUNTY.\r\n\r\nSnohomish county extends 36 miles in width from the Sound to the\r\npeaks of the Cascade mountains, adjoining King county on the north.\r\nIt has an area of some 2,500 square miles of territory, a population\r\nof about 63,000 people, and a great storehouse of wealth in its\r\nnatural resources. It is one of the largest and richest counties in\r\nthe state, with a mild and healthful climate, magnificent scenery,\r\ngreat diversity of landscape, innumerable water falls and plenty\r\nof game.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nThe forests of Snohomish are very extensive and but little depleted.\r\nFir, cedar, hemlock and spruce are its chief trees. Nearly one-half\r\nof the area of the county is heavily mineralized with veins of\r\ngold, silver, copper, lead, nickel, iron, and other ores. There\r\nare also vast ledges of marble, granite and other building stones.\r\n\r\nIn diversified agricultural possibilities, few counties can excel\r\nSnohomish. Its general soils in its valleys are alluvial, and produce\r\nastonishing crops; about the deltas of its rivers, the riches of\r\nthe salt water and the mountains have combined to make a soil that\r\nwill endure for ages and annually astonish the husbandman with\r\nits generosity. Upon its uplands, its clay and decaying herbage\r\nhave combined for ages to create a soil wonderfully adapted to\r\nproduce grass and fruits, and the industrious are luxuriating in\r\nnature's prodigality.\r\n\r\nRainfall is abundant, but not excessive, and crops of the cereals\r\nand fruits are never failures.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nThis county is splendidly provided with transportation facilities;\r\nmany steamboats ply its salt waters and part way up the three great\r\nrivers that flow into the Sound. Two transcontinental railroads\r\ncut the western part of the county in two. The trunk line of the\r\nGreat Northern follows the valley of one river from the southeast\r\nto the coast, while two branch lines run up the other two great\r\nvalleys, past the center of the state, toward the mountains, while\r\na dozen spurs and short logging and coal roads act as feeders to\r\nthe main lines, thus giving all the towns of the county access\r\nto all the Sound markets, and those of the east and the ports of\r\nthe Pacific ocean.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nEVERETT, situated upon a fine harbor on the shores of Puget Sound near\r\nthe mouth of the Snohomish river, is the county seat and metropolis\r\nof the county. It has a population of 35,000, and is fast developing\r\ninto a commercial and manufacturing center of importance.\r\n\r\nThe largest steamers afloat can find wharfage at her docks and\r\nsafe anchorage in her waters. It has upwards of 3,000 men employed\r\nin its factories and mills, with a monthly payroll aggregating\r\n$230,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 69.--Codfish and Salmon Packing Plants\r\nat Anacortes, Skagit County.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 70.--Plant for the Manufacture of Portland\r\nCement, Located in Skagit County.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 71.--Snohomish County Views.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 72.--Snohomish County Industrial Scenes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 73.--Street Scene in Stanwood, Snohomish\r\nCounty.

Three transcontinental railroads--the Northern Pacific,\r\nChicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, and Great Northern--traverse the\r\nCounty from east to west; a fourth transcontinental line, the Oregon\r\nRailway & Navigation company, enters from the southwest, and a fifth\r\ntranscontinental road, the Spokane International (C. P. R.), enters\r\n[Page 82]\r\nthe county from the northeast and terminates at Spokane. The Spokane\r\nFalls & Northern extends north into British Columbia and to Republic\r\nand Oroville, Wash. Electric trolley lines connect Spokane with\r\nthe outlying towns in every direction. The total railway mileage\r\nin the county is approximately 429 miles.\r\n\r\nTOPOGRAPHY AND INDUSTRIES.\r\n\r\nThe northern portion of the county is somewhat mountainous, and\r\nis covered with a fine growth of pine and tamarack timber; much of\r\nthis section is suitable for agriculture, while all is adapted to\r\ngrazing. The central part of the county is rolling and is traversed\r\nby the Spokane river; the central section to the west of the city\r\nof Spokane is fine agricultural land, while to the east of Spokane\r\nis the Spokane valley, which is rapidly being brought into a high\r\nstate of cultivation by means of irrigation. There are about 40,000\r\nacres in this valley capable of irrigation; 3,000 acres are now\r\nirrigated and under cultivation. The southern portion of the county\r\nis rolling, and comprises some of the finest agricultural land in the\r\nstate. Large areas of this section are utilized for wheat-raising,\r\nwhile here are grown the finest sugar beets in the world.\r\n\r\nLumbering is a considerable industry, while stock-raising and dairying\r\nare also extensively engaged in. Over 1,000,000 bushels of wheat\r\nare grown annually. The flour mills of the county have a combined\r\ncapacity of 3,600 barrels daily.\r\n\r\nIn fruit-growing Spokane is one of the leading counties of the\r\nstate. The value of the fruit produced in the county amounts to\r\nnearly $3,000,000 annually. The following table shows the distribution\r\nof the five important fruits.\r\n\r\n  _Trees planted_ 1908--                      _Total._\r\n  [*]Apples,         253,630                   713,567\r\n  Pears,              15,470                    39,232\r\n  Peaches,            59,323                    94,769\r\n  Cherries,           56,405                   106,909\r\n  Plums and Prunes,   11,815                    29,128\r\n  Miscellaneous        2,910                    10,000\r\n                     -------                 ---------\r\n                     399,553  Total planted  1,003,615\r\n\r\n[Footnote *: Is 25 percent. of the total number of apple trees planted\r\nin the state in 1908.]\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nThere are 165 school districts in the county and eighteen towns\r\nwhere graded schools are maintained. The total valuation of assessed\r\nproperty with improvements (1908) is $77,120,360; personal property,\r\n$10,527,030.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 75.--(1) Spokane Club Building, Spokane.\r\n(2)Riverside Avenue, Looking East from Post Street, Spokane.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 76.--Spokane River and Bridge at Spokane,\r\nShowing Fill for New Concrete Structure to Cost $500,000.]\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nSPOKANE, situated on the Spokane river, is the county seat of Spokane\r\ncounty, and is the metropolis of eastern Washington, having a\r\n[Page 83]\r\npopulation estimated at 120,000. Spokane is the center of a great\r\nwheat-raising section and is the principal mining and commercial\r\ncenter between the Cascades and the Rocky mountains. A conservative\r\nestimate of the total value of manufactured products for 1908 is\r\n$17,000,000. There are over 12,000 wage-earners, receiving over\r\n$10,000,000 annually. The principal industrial establishments are\r\nlumber mills, flour mills, machine shops, agricultural machinery,\r\nbrick plants, iron works, foundries, pottery, cereal food, furniture,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe industrial prosperity of the city is due largely to the mines\r\nin the vicinity, the great agricultural resources of the surrounding\r\ncountry, and to the extensive water power which offers special\r\ninducements to manufacturers. The Spokane river here has a total\r\nfall of 132 feet, which furnishes a minimum of 33,000 horse-power,\r\nof which 15,000 horse-power is developed.\r\n\r\nThere are four national banks, with a combined capital of $3,425,000.\r\nThe city owns its own water works, from which an annual revenue\r\nof more than $325,000 is derived.\r\n\r\nThe educational facilities are excellent. There are twenty-three\r\npublic school buildings, constructed of brick and stone, and costing\r\n$1,450,000. There are three daily newspapers, having a combined\r\ncirculation of 45,000. Here is located the U. S. circuit court;\r\nthe headquarters of the U. S. district court, eastern division;\r\nU. S. military post (Fort Wright); the government headquarters\r\nof the postal inspector service, known as the Spokane division,\r\nwhich includes the states of Washington, Montana, Idaho, Oregon,\r\nand the territory of Alaska, and a U. S. land office. Postoffice\r\nreceipts for 1908 amounted to $360,504.\r\n\r\nCHENEY, 10 miles southwest of Spokane, is a town of 1,500 people.\r\nHere is located one of the state normal schools, having about 400\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL LAKE is an important town, having the Eastern Washington\r\nHospital for the Insane near-by, It is a noted health resort.\r\n\r\nROCKFORD is an important agricultural town of 1,200 people.\r\n\r\nHILLYARD is an important place of 1,500 people, having the car shops\r\nof the Great Northern railway as its chief business.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEVENS COUNTY\r\n\r\nStevens county, in the extreme northeastern corner of the state,\r\nhas an area of 4,500 square miles and a population of about 24,000.\r\nIt is a county of great and diverse resources, is splendidly watered\r\nwith large rivers, the Columbia bounding it on the west, and the\r\nSpokane on part of its southern line. Three ranges of low mountains\r\nextend across the county nearly north and south. Between these the\r\nColville river and the Pend d'Oreille flow generally northerly\r\nthrough grand and beautiful valleys.\r\n\r\n[Page 84]\r\nRESOURCES AND PRODUCTIONS.\r\n\r\nAgriculture in all its branches, lumbering and kindred pursuits,\r\nand the mining of precious metals and building stones make up its\r\nchief sources of wealth.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\nThe farms in the Colville valley are noted for their heavy hay\r\ncrops, producing abundantly all the cereals, including corn, the\r\nclovers, timothy and alfalfa.\r\n\r\nDairying and stock-raising are important industries. To these the\r\nclimate and soils are well adapted. Some lands have been irrigated\r\nwith great benefit, but the bulk of the farming is successful without\r\nirrigation.\r\n\r\nFruit-raising is receiving deep interest of late, and the county\r\nbids fair to compete for honors with the very best localities in\r\nthe state for the hardier fruits.\r\n\r\nLumbering and saw-milling engage the attention of a large number\r\nof the people, the product of the mills finding a ready market\r\nin the farming region, large cities and mining camps.\r\n\r\nMining of the precious metals is a growing and an attractive industry.\r\nThe ores include gold, silver, lead, copper, tungsten and iron, while\r\nquarries of limestone, marble, onyx, fire-clay, etc., abound.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the navigable waters of the Columbia and Pend d'Oreille\r\nrivers, which traverse the outskirts of the county, the Great Northern\r\nrailway through the Colville valley from the southern to the northern\r\nboundary, reaches most of the agricultural and mining centers and\r\nrenders good service. The western part of the county, comparatively\r\nundeveloped, deserves much more attention.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nCOLVILLE is both the county seat and principal town in the county,\r\nhaving a population of 1,600 people, and is a growing town, a\r\ndistributing center on the railroad, surrounded by prosperous farming\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\nNORTHPORT is the center of much mining activity and has a large\r\nsmelter for the reduction of ores of the precious metals. It has\r\na population of 1,200.\r\n\r\nCHEWELAH is a center of agriculture, mining and lumbering industries\r\nin the center of the county, having about 1,000 people.\r\n\r\nNEWPORT, in the southeastern part of the county, is an important\r\nagricultural distributing center. A dozen other smaller towns offer\r\ngreat opportunities to the homeseeker.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 77.--Raising Potatoes in Young Orchard,\r\nSpokane County.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 78.--Basalt Columns, Spokane River at Spokane.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 79.--STEVENS COUNTY VIEWS. \"Where the\r\nElephant Drinks,\" a Remarkable Crag on the Bank of the Pend d'Oreille\r\nRiver.

It is a county of wooded hills and valleys with\r\na few open prairies well watered by mountain streams, chief of\r\nwhich is the Nisqually, which forms its dividing line from Pierce\r\ncounty, and the Des Chutes river, which makes a splendid waterfall\r\nof some 85 feet, a few miles south of Olympia. It has an area of\r\nabout 700 square miles, 100 miles of salt-water shore, a population\r\nof about 20,000, and a delightful climate and magnificent scenery of\r\nlofty mountains; great expanse of inland salt water, and green-clad\r\nislands and fields in every direction.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nThe county is one of the oldest settled portions of the state,\r\nand has a great variety of natural resources, among which are its\r\ntimber areas, its agricultural fields, its coal mines, its fisheries,\r\nincluding clam and oyster beds, gray sandstone quarries, and a\r\ngreat variety of clays.\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIES.\r\n\r\nThe sawmills of the county are still a very important industry\r\nand shiploads of lumber are sent out from its wharves. All the\r\ncereals and grasses yield abundant crops; root crops are extensive;\r\nfruit of great variety and fine flavor is very prominent. Dairying\r\nis flourishing, the county having more dairies than any other in\r\nthe state. Coal mining is in its infancy, but has progressed far\r\nenough to demonstrate the existence of vast areas of lignite coal,\r\nhaving some six veins and having a combined thickness of 61 feet\r\nof coal. About 50,000 sacks of oysters are annually marketed.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Pacific railway connects Olympia with all the important\r\nSound ports and the east, and all the transcontinental roads coming\r\nto the Sound from the south will pass through the county. Together\r\nwith its salt-water deep harbors, these give the county splendid\r\ncompetition and variety of commercial facilities.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL CITIES.\r\n\r\nOLYMPIA, the chief town of the county, at once the county seat,\r\nstate capital and county metropolis, is situated on one of the\r\ndeep-water inlets of Puget sound. Its population is about 12,000.\r\nWhile it has a beautiful sandstone structure, now used for capitol\r\npurposes, the state is about to erect a new capitol building, to\r\ncost $1,000,000. The foundation is already built. Olympia has one\r\nof the U. S. land offices and the U. S. surveyor-general's office.\r\nIt is lighted and furnished with power for street-car and other\r\npurposes from the power of Tumwater falls. The city is a beautiful\r\none of fine homes, shaded streets and parks, surrounded by a very\r\nprosperous agricultural community,\r\n[Page 86]\r\nproducing great quantities of fruit, dairy and poultry products.\r\n\r\nSeveral other smaller towns on the railroads are local centers of\r\ncommercial activity.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAHKIAKUM COUNTY\r\n\r\nWahkiakum is a small county, having only 275 square miles of territory,\r\nlocated on the Columbia river in the southwestern corner of the\r\nstate, near the ocean. Its population is about 4,000. The county\r\nis heavily timbered and well watered. In many parts of the county\r\nthe soil is exceptionally fertile. The climate is mild, but somewhat\r\nhumid. In the northern part are some low mountains, from which the\r\ndrainage is south through the county to the Columbia river.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nThe resources of the county consist in its timber, its fertile soil,\r\nand the fish in the river and ocean.\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIES.\r\n\r\nLogging, saw-milling, and industries growing out of these; agriculture,\r\ndairying, and fishing are the chief occupation of its people. There\r\nare several logging concerns in the county and large saw-mills.\r\nFish canneries dot its river shores; several creameries and dairies\r\nare manufacturing butter, while its farms produce hay, potatoes,\r\nfruits, cattle, hogs, poultry, eggs, and other products, chiefly\r\nfor the Portland market. Many of its citizens are fishermen and\r\nsome make considerable sums trapping fur animals in the winters.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nThe Columbia river is the great highway of the county; no railroads\r\nare within its borders or near. Owing to the small area of the\r\ncounty, this condition is no great drawback, as all the people have\r\nready access to the river wharves.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL TOWNS.\r\n\r\nCATHLAMET, on the Columbia, is the county seat, with about 500 people,\r\nand is the chief distributing center of the county.\r\n\r\nROSBURG, DEEP RIVER, BROOKFIELD, ALTOONA, and SKAMOKAWA are centers\r\nof industry. This county offers exceptional opportunities for the\r\nfrontiersman.\r\n\r\n\r\nWALLA WALLA COUNTY\r\n\r\nWalla Walla is the county of many waters. It is the most western\r\nof the southeastern counties of the state, and is bounded north\r\nand west by the Snake and Columbia rivers. It has 1,296 square\r\nmiles and a population of about 30,000. The elevation varies from\r\n350 feet at the Columbia river to 2,500 feet along its eastern\r\nborder. It is a succession of plains and rolling hills, covered\r\nwith bunch-grass, with some trees along the streams. Its soil varies\r\nfrom quite sandy volcanic ash in the low lands near the Columbia to a\r\n[Page 87]\r\nheavier clay loam in the eastern parts. In common with much of\r\neastern Washington, these lands increase in fertility with successive\r\ncultivations. The climate is mild, healthful and vigorous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 81.--Farm Scene Near Colville, Stevens\r\nCounty.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 82.--View of Calispell Valley and Pend\r\nd'Oreille River, Stevens County.]\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nWalla Walla county is essentially agricultural. Its chief resource\r\nis its soil fertility. This is such that few farmers can be found\r\nwho have not bank accounts.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nThe annual production of wheat in Walla Walla county is about 5,000,000\r\nbushels. Barley is also a profitable crop. Oats and some corn are\r\nalso raised. Large crops of alfalfa hay are annually marketed,\r\nchiefly from irrigated lands. Fruit of all kinds is abundant. There\r\nare 2,500 acres devoted to orchards. Market gardening is an important\r\nand growing industry.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nThere are 310 miles of railroads in this county, both the Northern\r\nPacific and Oregon Railroad & Navigation Company railroads competing\r\nfor the traffic. In addition to the railroads, steamboats are plying\r\nthe rivers around the edge of the county, giving additional facilities\r\nfor transportation.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nWALLA WALLA, the county seat, has a population of about 22,000 and\r\nis the commercial center for the southeastern part of the state.\r\nIts streets are paved. The city owns its own system of water, at\r\na cost of $600,000. It is lighted with electricity and gas, has\r\nlarge banks and business houses, U. S. land office, U. S. courts,\r\nU. S. cavalry post, an Odd Fellows' home, and a Home for Widows\r\nand Orphans. There are manufacturing industries employing 400 men,\r\nturning out $2,000,000 of productions annually. An electric system\r\nof street cars traverses the streets and is projected into several\r\nother near-by towns.\r\n\r\nWAITSBURG is an important agricultural town of about 1,600 people,\r\nin the western part of the county, having both railroad systems,\r\nand ships great quantities of grain. It has large flouring mills,\r\nwarehouses, fine schools and churches, and is a prosperous, thriving\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nA large number of shipping points on both systems of railroads are\r\ngrowing commercial centers.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHATCOM COUNTY\r\n\r\nWhatcom county lies on the boundary of British Columbia, stretching\r\nfrom the Straits of Georgia to the peaks of the Cascade mountains--24\r\nmiles wide and 100 miles long, The eastern half or more of the\r\ncounty is included in the national forest reserve, with Mount Baker,\r\n10,827 feet high, in the center of the county. It is one of the\r\nimportant counties on tide water, and has an area of 2,226 square\r\nmiles and a population of about 70,000.\r\n\r\n[Page 88]\r\nThe climate is not different from the general Puget sound climate\r\nbeing mild and healthful. There are no severe storms, no sultry\r\nheat and no severe cold.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that Whatcom county has three billion feet of standing\r\ntimber. This is its greatest source of wealth. The western half\r\nof the county, outside of the lumbering, etc., is blessed with\r\na wealth of soil responding to the farmer's labor generously.\r\n\r\nThe eastern half of the county is essentially a mountainous,\r\nforest-covered mining region, and has in store many veins of nearly\r\nall the metals.\r\n\r\nGame of great variety of animals and fowls and fish are abundant.\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIES.\r\n\r\nThe people of Whatcom county are engaged in lumbering and running\r\nsaw-mills, one of the largest of the state being in this county;\r\nmanufacturing of various kinds from the raw products in the county,\r\nincluding shingle mills and shingle machinery factory, salmon canneries,\r\nplaning mills, barrel factories, Portland cement factory, and many\r\nothers. Of no small importance is farming, fruit-growing and dairying.\r\nProspecting and mining engage the attention and labor of a large\r\nnumber of citizens.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nAside from having a long salt-water coast, open to traffic from\r\nthe ocean, with splendid harbors, the county is traversed in all\r\nits agricultural half by a network of railroads, by the Northern\r\nPacific, Great Northern, B. B. and B. C. railroads. These furnish\r\nexceptional means of traffic to all industries excepting the mining.\r\nThe county has also an admirable system of wagon roads, some planked,\r\nsome graveled and some graded and drained, covering about 700 miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 83.--Products of Thurston County Waters.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate No. 84.--Thurston County Stick. 14,000 Feet.\r\nSandstone Quarry, Tenino, Thurston County.

It has a population of about 40,000 people. Into\r\nit all the railroads center, while the harbor is one of the best\r\nin Washington. It is largely a manufacturing town, having plants\r\nfor the production of sash, doors, columns, tin cans, boilers,\r\nengines, flour and feed, canned fish, condensed milk, and many\r\nothers. It is a substantial, live business community of wide-awake\r\npeople, and growing rapidly. It has a gravity water system, electric\r\nlights, and gas plant.\r\n\r\nBLAINE is a city of about 3,000 inhabitants, situated close to the\r\nCanadian line and on the Great Northern railway. Timber and lumber\r\nmanufactures are the chief sources of its prosperity. Fishing and the\r\ncanning of salmon are also important industries. The railroad\r\n[Page 89]\r\ncompany has recently expended considerable sums in improving its\r\nfacilities. Blaine is a growing community.\r\n\r\nSUMAS, on the Canadian border, is a lumbering town of 1,100 people.\r\n\r\nLYNDEN is an agricultural center of 1,200 citizens.\r\n\r\nFERNDALE is a lumber center of 1,000 people. Besides, there are a\r\ndozen smaller business centers in the county, growing and prosperous.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITMAN COUNTY\r\n\r\nWhitman county is one of the chief agricultural counties of the\r\nstate, lying immediately south of Spokane county and on the Idaho\r\nstate line, having the Snake river for its southern boundary. The\r\ncounty is a plateau of rolling prairie lands, a large portion of\r\nwhich is farmed, watered by a number of streams, which are utilized\r\nfor irrigation purposes in some of the bottom lands--although the\r\nrainfall is sufficient to mature crops, and no irrigation is had\r\non the great bulk of the farms. The area is about 2,000 square\r\nmiles. The population is about 40,000. The soil is a strong mixture\r\nof volcanic ash and clay of great fertility and permanence. Twenty\r\nyears of wheat-growing still leaves the soil able to produce from\r\n25 to 50 bushels per acre.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nAll the resources of the county originate in this splendid soil.\r\nFor growing all the cereals and fruits and vegetables it has no\r\nsuperior. The county is well settled, and probably no county can\r\nexcel Whitman county in the per capita wealth of its farmers. The\r\nproducts of the county are varied, and include wheat, oats, barley\r\nand hay, all giving splendid yields--wheat from 30 to 50 bushels,\r\noats 60 to 100 bushels, barley from 50 to 80 bushels, and hay from\r\n4 to 6 tons per acre. Potatoes, sugar beets and other vegetables\r\nproduce fine crops.\r\n\r\nThe hardier fruits, such as apples, pears, plums and cherries,\r\nare successfully raised in all parts of the county, while on the\r\nbottom lands, along the Snake river, peaches, melons, etc., are\r\nproduced in abundance. Seventy-five carloads of fruit go out annually\r\nfrom one orchard.\r\n\r\nWheat gives up five and one-half million bushels to the farmers\r\neach year. Oats one and three-fourths million and barley about\r\none-half million bushels. Whitman county has more banks than any\r\ncounty in eastern Washington besides Spokane.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nWhitman county is as well, or better, provided with railroads than\r\nany agricultural county in the state. The Northern Pacific, O.\r\nR. & N., Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul and the S. & I. railroads\r\nare all interlaced about its grain-fields. These all connect with\r\nSpokane, and give access to all eastern and western markets.\r\n\r\n[Page 90]\r\nPRINCIPAL TOWNS.\r\n\r\nCOLFAX, the county seat, situated near the center of the county, on\r\nthe railroads and Palouse river, is the largest town in the county,\r\nwith about 3,600 population. The town owns its own water system, has\r\nelectric lights, fine court-house, banks, mills, warehouses, etc.\r\n\r\nPULLMAN is a town of 3,000 people, near which is located the Washington\r\nState College, a large educational institution supported by the state,\r\nhaving about 1,000 students. It is an important grain-shipping\r\npoint. It has a public water system, electric lights, and is a\r\nthriving and growing commercial center.\r\n\r\nPALOUSE is a railroad center of 2,500 people, a large shipping point\r\nfor grain, live stock, fruits and pottery.\r\n\r\nOAKESDALE is a town of 1,500 people, having three railroads, and\r\nis an important shipping point.\r\n\r\nTEKOA has a population of about 1,400, is a railroad center, and\r\nis a large shipper of fruits and grain.\r\n\r\nGARFIELD has a population of 1,000, and ships much grain and other\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\nROSALIA has 1,000 population, and is an important grain center.\r\n\r\nThis county has a dozen other shipping points where from 300 to 700\r\npeople are supported by the business originating on the tributary\r\nfarms.\r\n\r\nYAKIMA COUNTY\r\n\r\nYakima county is one of the large and important counties in the\r\nstate, having the Yakima Indian reservation included within its\r\nboundaries. Its area is 3,222 square miles and it has a population of\r\nabout 38,000. It is watered by the Yakima river and its tributaries,\r\nand through its valleys the railroads from the east find their\r\neasiest grade toward the Cascade passes. It is a county of level\r\nvalleys and plateaus, having a soil made up chiefly of volcanic\r\nash and disintegrated basaltic rocks, of great depth, which yields\r\nfabulously in cereal and grass crops, fruits and vegetables with\r\nthe magic touch of irrigation. Artificial watering is 30 years old\r\nin this valley, and yet only a very small area was thus treated\r\nuntil the matter was taken up by the national government. But now\r\nvast areas are being provided with water, and the consequent growth\r\nand development of the county is wonderful.\r\n\r\nA series of lakes in the mountains are being utilized as reservoirs,\r\nand from these lakes the waters are being distributed in many directions\r\nin the large irrigating canals. When the projects now under way are\r\ncompleted, more than 200,000 acres will be under ditches.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nYakima's wealth consists in the combination of its soil and water\r\nand climate. The county, lying east of the Cascade mountains, in\r\n[Page 91]\r\nlarge part at a low elevation, receives somewhat severe heat in\r\nthe summer, which gives the opportunity successfully to ripen the\r\nless hardy fruits--peaches, apricots, grapes, etc. The county has\r\nhalf a million bearing trees and two and one-half million young\r\ntrees growing in its orchards.\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIES.\r\n\r\nNaturally the industries of the county consist in exploiting its\r\nnatural resources, and so we find Yakima citizens busy in raising\r\nfruits, hay, grain, and garden vegetables, to supply the big cities\r\nof the Sound. Its last year's contribution will probably exceed\r\nten million dollars in value.\r\n\r\nOf the items which compose this large sum, fruit is probably chief\r\nin importance. Alfalfa and grain-hay is an important item, as is\r\nalso the crop of melons and potatoes. The combined fields of alfalfa\r\nand orchards make ideal bee pasturage, and Yakima honey is a constant\r\nfactor of barter in the Sound cities. The upland farms produce\r\nquantities of all grains--wheat, oats, and barley--and some field\r\ncorn is successfully raised in the warmer parts. Sheep, cattle\r\nand horses are also exported. Hops are a large crop.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nNORTH YAKIMA is at once the county seat and chief metropolis of\r\nthe entire Yakima valley, having a population of about 12,000. It\r\nis situated on the Northern Pacific railway and Yakima river, and\r\nis the distributing center for both merchandise and farm products\r\nfor a large surrounding territory.\r\n\r\nThe State Fair, supported by the state, holds annual exhibits here.\r\nIt has extensive fruit canneries, flour mills, lumber mills, other\r\nwoodworking factories, large warehouses, paved streets, big business\r\nblocks, fine churches, schools, banks, newspapers, etc.\r\n\r\nSUNNYSIDE, a town built up among the irrigated farms, has a population\r\nof 1,500. Here are a cannery, pulp mill, creameries, etc.\r\n\r\nTOPPENISH and MABTON are commercial centers of importance of about\r\n700 inhabitants each, and growing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 92]\r\nSTATISTICAL APPENDIX.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS OF THE INCORPORATED CITIES AND TOWNS OF WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n =======================================================================\r\n     NAME.    |   County.   |      Mayor.      |      Clerk.\r\n -------------|-------------|------------------|------------------------\r\n Aberdeen     | Chehalis    | E.
