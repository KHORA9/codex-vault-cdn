As soon as a person is old enough,\r\nhe may marry in these provinces, without any fear of poverty; for there\r\nis such a tract of good ground yet uncultivated, that a new-married man\r\ncan, without difficulty, get a spot of ground, where he may\r\nsufficiently subsist with his wife and children. The taxes are very\r\nlow, and he need not be under any concern on their account. The\r\nliberties he enjoys are so great, that he considers himself as a prince\r\nin his possessions. I shall here demonstrate by some plain examples,\r\nwhat effect such a constitution is capable of.\r\n\r\nMaons Keen, one of the Swedes in Raccoon, was now near seventy years\r\nold: he had many children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren; so\r\nthat, of those who were yet alive, he could muster up forty-five\r\npersons. Besides them, several of his children and grandchildren died\r\nyoung, and some in a mature age. He was, therefore, uncommonly blessed.\r\nYet his happiness is not comparable to that which is to be seen in the\r\nfollowing examples, and which I have extracted from the Philadelphia\r\ngazette.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1732, January the 24th, died at Ipswich, in New England,\r\nMrs. Sarah Tuthil, a widow, aged eighty-six years. She had brought\r\nsixteen children into the world; and from seven of them only, she had\r\nseen one hundred and seventy-seven grandchildren and\r\ngreat-grandchildren.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1739, May the 30th, the children, grand and\r\ngreat-grandchildren, of Mr. Richard Buttington, in the parish of\r\nChester, in Pensylvania, were assembled in his house; and they made\r\ntogether one hundred and fifteen persons. The parent of these children,\r\nRichard Buttington, who was born in England, was then entering into his\r\neighty-fifth year: and was at that time quite fresh, active, and\r\nsensible. His eldest son, then sixty years old, was the first\r\nEnglishman born in Pensylvania.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1742, on the 8th of January, died at Trenton, in New\r\nJersey, Mrs. Sarah Furman, a widow, aged ninety-seven years. She was\r\nborn in New England; and left five children, sixty-one grandchildren,\r\none hundred and eighty-two great-grandchildren, and twelve\r\ngreat-great-grandchildren, who were all alive when she died.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1739, on the 28th of January, died at South Kingston, in\r\nNew England, Mrs. Maria Hazard, a widow, in the hundredth year of her\r\nage. She was born in Rhode Island, and was a grandmother of the then\r\nvice-governor of that island, Mr. George Hazard. She could count\r\naltogether five hundred children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren,\r\nand great-great-grandchildren. When she died, two hundred and five\r\npersons of them were alive; a grand-daughter of hers had already been\r\ngrandmother near fifteen years.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, the usual wish or blessing in our liturgy, that the\r\nnew-married couple may see their grandchildren, till the third and\r\nfourth generation, has been literally fulfilled in regard to some of\r\nthese persons [1].\r\n\r\nDecember the 9th. In every country, we commonly meet with a number of\r\ninsects; of which many, though they be ever so small and contemptible,\r\ncan do considerable damage to the inhabitants. Of these dangerous\r\ninsects, there are likewise some in North America: some are peculiar to\r\nthat country, others are common to Europe likewise.\r\n\r\nI have already, in the preceding volume, mentioned the Mosquitoes, as a\r\nkind of disagreeable gnats; and another noxious insect, the Bruchus\r\nPisi, which destroys whole fields with pease. I shall here add some\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThere are a kind of Locusts which about every seventeenth year come\r\nhither in incredible numbers. They come out of the ground in the middle\r\nof May, and make, for six weeks together, such a noise in the trees and\r\nwoods, that two persons who meet in such places, cannot understand each\r\nother, unless they speak louder than the locusts can chirp. During that\r\ntime, they make, with the sting in their tail, holes into the soft bark\r\nof the little branches on the trees, by which means these branches are\r\nruined. They do no other harm to the trees or other plants. In the\r\ninterval between the years when they are so numerous, they are only\r\nseen or heard single in the woods.\r\n\r\nThere is likewise a kind of Caterpillars in these provinces, which eat\r\nthe leaves from the trees. They are also innumerable in some years. In\r\nthe intervals there are but few of them: but when they come, they strip\r\nthe trees so entirely of their leaves, that the woods in the middle of\r\nsummer are as naked as in winter. They eat all kinds of leaves, and\r\nvery few trees are left untouched by them; as, about that time of the\r\nyear the heat is most excessive. The stripping the trees of their\r\nleaves has this fatal consequence, that they cannot withstand the heat,\r\nbut dry up entirely. In this manner, great forests are sometimes\r\nentirely ruined. The Swedes who live here shewed me, here and there,\r\ngreat tracts in the woods, where young trees were now growing, instead\r\nof the old ones, which, some years ago, had been destroyed by the\r\ncaterpillars. These caterpillars afterwards change into moths, or\r\nphalænæ, which shall be described in the sequel, in their proper\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nIn other years the Grass-worms do a great deal of damage in several\r\nplaces, both in the meadows and corn-fields. For the fields are at\r\ncertain times over-run with great armies of these worms, as with the\r\nother insects; yet it is very happy that these many plagues do not come\r\nall together. For in those years when the locusts are numerous, the\r\ncaterpillars and grass-worms are not very considerable, and it happens\r\nso with the latter kinds, so that only one of the three kinds comes at\r\na time. Then there are several years when they are very scarce. The\r\ngrass-worms have been observed to settle chiefly in a fat soil; but as\r\nsoon as careful husbandmen discover them, they draw narrow channels\r\nwith almost perpendicular sides quite round the field in which the\r\nworms are settled; then by creeping further they all fall into the\r\nditch, and cannot get out again. I was assured by many persons that\r\nthese three sorts of insects followed each other pretty closely; and\r\nthat the locusts came in the first year, the caterpillars in the\r\nsecond, and the grass-worms in the last: I have likewise found by my\r\nown experience that this is partly true.\r\n\r\nMoths, or Tineæ, which eat the clothes, are likewise abundant here. I\r\nhave seen cloth, worsted gloves, and other woollen stuffs, which had\r\nhung all the summer locked up in a shrine, and had not been taken care\r\nof, quite cut through by these worms, so that whole pieces fell out:\r\nSometimes they were so spoiled that they could not be mended again.\r\nFurs which had been kept in the garret were frequently so ruined by\r\nworms, that the hair went off by handfuls. I am however not certain\r\nwhether these worms were originally in the country, or whether they\r\nwere brought over from Europe.\r\n\r\nFleas are likewise to be found in this part of the world. Many\r\nthousands were undoubtedly brought over from other countries; yet\r\nimmense numbers of them have certainly been here since time immemorial.\r\nI have seen them on the grey squirrels, and on the hares which have\r\nbeen killed in such desart parts of this country, where no human\r\ncreature ever lived. As I afterwards came further up into the country,\r\nand was obliged to lie at night in the huts and beds of the Indians, I\r\nwas so plagued by immense quantities of fleas, that I imagined I was\r\nput to the torture. They drove me from the bed, and I was very glad to\r\nsleep on the benches below the roof of the huts. But it is easy to\r\nconceive that the many dogs which the Indians keep, breed fleas without\r\nend. Dogs and men lie promiscuously in the huts; and a stranger can\r\nhardly lie down and shut his eyes, but he is in danger of being either\r\nsquezed to death, or stifled by a dozen or more dogs, which lie round\r\nhim, and upon him, in order to have a good resting place. For I imagine\r\nthey do not expect that strangers will venture to beat them or throw\r\nthem off, as their masters and mistresses commonly do.\r\n\r\nThe noisy Crickets (Gryllus domesticus) which are sometimes to be met\r\nwith in the houses in Sweden, I have not perceived in any part of\r\nPensylvania or New Jersey, and other people whom I have asked, could\r\nnot say that they had ever seen any. In summer there are a kind of\r\nblack Crickets [2] in the fields, which make exactly the same chirping\r\nnoise as our house crickets. But they keep only to the fields, and were\r\nsilent as soon as winter or the cold weather came on. They say it\r\nsometimes happens that these field crickets take refuge in houses, and\r\nchirp continually there, whilst it is warm weather, or whilst the rooms\r\nare warm; but as soon as it grows cold they are silent. In some parts\r\nof the province of New York, and in Canada, every farm-house and most\r\nof the houses in the towns, swarm with so many, that no farm-house in\r\nour country can be better stocked with them. They continue their music\r\nthere throughout the whole winter.\r\n\r\nBugs (Cimex lectularius) are very plentiful here. I have been\r\nsufficiently tormented by them, in many places in Canada: But I do not\r\nremember having seen any with the Indians, during my stay at Fort\r\nFrederic. The commander there, Mr. de Lousignan, told me, that none of\r\nthe Illinois and other Indians of the western parts of North America\r\nknew any thing of these vermin. And he added, that he could with\r\ncertainty say this from his own experience, having been among them for\r\na great while. Yet I cannot determine whether bugs were first brought\r\nover by the Europeans, or whether they have originally been in the\r\ncountry. Many people looked upon them as natives of this country, and\r\nas a proof of it said, that under the wings of bats the people had\r\noften found bugs, which had eaten very deep into the flesh. It was\r\ntherefore believed that the bats had got them in some hollow tree, and\r\nhad afterwards brought them into the houses, as they commonly fix\r\nthemselves close to the walls, and creep into the little chinks which\r\nthey meet with. But as I have never seen any bugs upon bats, I cannot\r\nsay any thing upon that subject. Perhaps a louse or a tick (Acarus) has\r\nbeen taken for a bug. Or, if a real bug has been found upon a bat’s\r\nwing, it is very easy to conceive that it fixed on the bat, whilst the\r\nlatter was sitting in the chinks of a house stocked with European bugs.\r\n\r\nAs the people here could not bear the inconvenience of these vermin,\r\nany more than we can in Sweden, they endeavoured to expel them by\r\ndifferent means. I have already remarked in the preceding volume, that\r\nthe beds to that purpose were made of Sassafras wood, but that they\r\nwere only temporary remedies. Some persons assured me that they had\r\nfound from their own experience, and by repeated trials, that no remedy\r\nwas more effectual towards the expulsion of bugs, than the injecting of\r\nboiling water into all the cracks where they are settled, and washing\r\nall the wood of the beds with it; this being twice or thrice repeated,\r\nthe bugs are wholly destroyed. But if there are bugs in neighbouring\r\nhouses, they will fasten to one’s clothes, and thus be brought over\r\ninto other houses.\r\n\r\nI cannot say whether these remedies are good or no, as I have not tried\r\nthem; but by repeated trials I have been convinced that sulphur, if it\r\nbe properly employed, entirely destroys bugs and their eggs in beds and\r\nwalls, though they were ten times more numerous than the ants in an\r\nant-hill [3].\r\n\r\nThe Mill-beetles, or Cock-roaches, are likewise a plague of North\r\nAmerica, and are settled in many of its provinces. The learned Dr.\r\nColden was of opinion that these insects were properly natives of the\r\nWest Indies, and that those that were found in North America were\r\nbrought over from those islands. To confirm his opinion, he said, that\r\nit was yet daily seen how the ships coming with goods from the West\r\nIndies to North America brought mill-beetles with them in great\r\nnumbers. But from the observations which I have made in this country, I\r\nhave reason to believe that these insects have been on the continent of\r\nNorth America since time immemorial. Yet notwithstanding this I do not\r\ndeny their being brought over from the West Indies. They are in almost\r\nevery house in the city of New York; and those are undoubtedly come\r\nover with ships. But how can that be said of those mill-beetles, which\r\nare found in the midst of the woods and desarts?\r\n\r\nThe English likewise call the Mill-beetles, Cock-roaches, and the Dutch\r\ngive them the name of Kackerlack. The Swedes in this country call them\r\nBrodoetare, or Bread-eaters, on account of the damage they do to the\r\nbread, which I am going to describe. Dr. Linnæus calls them Blatta\r\nOrientalis. Many of the Swedes call them likewise Kackerlack. They are\r\nnot only observed in the houses, but in the summer they appear often in\r\nthe woods, and run about the trees, which are cut down. On bringing in\r\nall sorts of old rotten blocks of wood for fewel, in February, I\r\ndiscovered several cock-roaches settled in them; they were at first\r\nquite torpid, or as it were dead; but after lying in the room for a\r\nwhile, they recovered, became very lively, and began to run about. I\r\nafterwards found very often, that when old rotten wood was brought home\r\nin winter, and cut in pieces for fewel, the cock-roaches were got into\r\nit in numbers, and lay in it in a torpid state. In the same winter, a\r\nfellow cut down a great dry tree, and was about to split it. I then\r\nobserved in a crack, some fathoms above the ground, several\r\ncock-roaches together with the common ants. They were, it seems, crept\r\nup a great way, in order to find a secure place of abode against\r\nwinter. On travelling in the middle of October 1749, through the\r\nuninhabited country between the English and French colonies, and making\r\na fire at night near a thick half rotten tree, on the shore of lake\r\nChamplain, numbers of cock-roaches came out of the wood, being wakened\r\nby the smoke and the fire, which had driven them out of their holes.\r\nThe Frenchmen, who were then in my company, did not know them, and\r\ncould not give them any name. In Canada the French did not remember\r\nseeing any in the houses. In Pensylvania, I am told, they run in\r\nimmense numbers about the sheaves of corn, during the harvest. At other\r\ntimes they live commonly in the houses in the English settlements, and\r\nlie in the crevices, especially in the cracks of those beams which\r\nsupport the ceiling, and are nearest to the chimney.\r\n\r\nThey do a deal of damage by eating the soft parts of the bread. If they\r\nhave once made a hole into a loaf, they will in a little time eat all\r\nthe soft part in it, so that on cutting the loaf, nothing but the crust\r\nis left. I am told they likewise eat other victuals. Sometimes they\r\nbite people’s noses or feet, whilst they are asleep. An old Swede,\r\ncalled Sven Laock, a grandson of the Rev. Mr. Laockenius, one of the\r\nfirst Swedish clergymen that came to Pensylvania, told me, that he had\r\nin his younger years been once very much frightened on account of a\r\ncock-roach, which crept into his ear whilst he was asleep. He waked\r\nsuddenly, jumped out of bed, and felt that the insect, probably out of\r\nfear, was endeavouring with all its strength to get deeper. These\r\nattempts of the cock-roach were so painful to him, that he imagined his\r\nhead was bursting, and he was almost senseless; however he hastened to\r\nthe well, and bringing up a bucket full of water, threw some into his\r\near. As soon as the cock-roach found itself in danger of being drowned,\r\nit endeavoured to save itself, and pushed backwards out of the ear,\r\nwith its hind feet, and thus happily delivered the poor man from his\r\nfears.\r\n\r\nThe Wood-lice are disagreeable insects, which in a manner are worse\r\nthan the preceding; but as I have already described them in a peculiar\r\nmemoir, which is printed among the memoirs of the Royal Academy of\r\nSciences for the year 1754, I refer my readers to that account.\r\n\r\nDecember the 11th. This morning I made a little excursion to Penn’s\r\nNeck, and further over the Delaware to Wilmington. The country round\r\nPenn’s Neck has the same qualities as that about other places in this\r\npart of New Jersey. For the ground consists chiefly of sand, with a\r\nthin stratum of black soil. It is not very hilly, but chiefly flat, and\r\nin most places covered with open woods of such trees as have annual\r\nleaves, especially oak. Now and then you see a single farm, and a\r\nlittle corn field round it. Between them are here and there little\r\nmarshes or swamps, and sometimes a brook with water, which has a very\r\nslow motion.\r\n\r\nThe woods of these parts consist of all sorts of trees, but chiefly of\r\noak and hiccory. These woods have certainly never been cut down, and\r\nhave always grown without hindrance. It might therefore be expected\r\nthat there are trees of an uncommon great age to be found in them; but\r\nit happens otherwise, and there are very few trees three hundred years\r\nold. Most of them are only two hundred years old; and this convinced me\r\nthat trees have the same quality as animals, and die after they are\r\narrived at a certain age. Thus we find great woods here, but when the\r\ntrees in them have stood an hundred and fifty or an hundred and eighty\r\nyears, they are either rotting within, or losing their crown, or their\r\nwood becomes quite soft, or their roots are no longer able to draw in\r\nsufficient nourishment, or they die from some other cause. Therefore\r\nwhen storms blow, which sometimes happens here, the trees are broke off\r\neither just above the root, or in the middle, or at the summit. Several\r\ntrees are likewise torn out with their roots by the power of the winds.\r\nThe storms thus cause great devastations in these forests. Every where\r\nyou see trees thrown down by the winds, after they are too much\r\nweakened by one or the other of the above mentioned causes to be able\r\nto resist their fury. Fire likewise breaks out often in the woods, and\r\nburns the trees half way from the root, so that a violent gust of wind\r\neasily throws them down.\r\n\r\nOn travelling through these woods, I purposely tried to find out, by\r\nthe position of the trees which were fallen down, which winds are the\r\nstrongest hereabouts. But I could not conclude any thing with\r\ncertainty, for the trees fell on all sides, and lay towards all the\r\npoints of the compass. I therefore judged, that any wind which blows\r\nfrom that side where the roots of the tree are weakest and shortest,\r\nand where it can make the least resistance, must root it up and throw\r\nit down. In this manner the old trees die away continually, and are\r\nsucceeded by a young generation. Those which are thrown down lay on the\r\nground and putrify, sooner or later, and by that means encrease the\r\nblack soil, into which the leaves are likewise finally changed, which\r\ndrop abundantly in autumn, are blown about by the winds for some time,\r\nbut are heaped up, and lie on both sides of the trees, which are fallen\r\ndown. It requires several years before a tree is intirely reduced to\r\ndust. When the winds tear up a tree with the roots, a quantity of loose\r\nsoil commonly comes out with and sticks to them for some time, but at\r\nlast it drops off, and forms a little hillock, which is afterwards\r\naugmented by the leaves, which commonly gather about the roots. Thus\r\nseveral inequalities are formed in the woods, such as little holes land\r\nhills; and by this means the upper soil must likewise be heaped up in\r\nsuch places.\r\n\r\nSome trees are more inclined to putrify than others. The tupelo-tree\r\n(Nyssa), the tulip-tree (Liriodendron), and the sweet gum-tree\r\n(Liquidambar), became rotten in a short time. The hiccory did not take\r\nmuch time, and the black oak fell sooner to pieces than the white oak;\r\nbut this was owing to circumstances. If the bark remained on the wood,\r\nit was for the greatest part rotten, and entirely eaten by worms\r\nwithin, in the space of six, eight, or ten years, so that nothing was\r\nto be found but a reddish brown dust. But if the bark was taken off,\r\nthey would often lie twenty years before they were entirely rotten. The\r\nsuddenness of a tree’s growth, the bigness of its pores, and the\r\nfrequent changes of heat and wet in summer, cause it to rot sooner. To\r\nthis it must be added, that all sorts of insects make holes into the\r\nstems of the fallen trees, and by that means the moisture and the air\r\nget into the tree, which must of course forward putrefaction. Most of\r\nthe trees here have deciduous or annual leaves. Many of them begin to\r\nrot whilst they are yet standing and blooming. This forms the hollow\r\ntrees, in which many animals make their nests and places of refuge.\r\n\r\nThe breadth of the Delaware directly opposite Wilmington is reckoned an\r\nEnglish mile and a half; yet to look at it, it did not seem to be so\r\ngreat. The depth of the river, in the middle, is said to be from four\r\nto six fathoms here.\r\n\r\nDecember the 12th. The Joiners say, that among the trees of this\r\ncountry they chiefly use the black walnut-trees, the wild cherry-trees,\r\nand the curled maple. Of the black walnut-trees (Juglans nigra) there\r\nis yet a sufficient quantity. However careless people take pains enough\r\nto destroy them, and some peasants even use them as fewel. The wood of\r\nthe wild cherry-trees (Prunus Virginiana) is very good, and looks\r\nexceedingly well; it has a yellow colour, and the older the furniture\r\nis, which is made of it, the better it looks. But it is already\r\ndifficult to get at it, for they cut it every where, and plant it no\r\nwhere. The curled maple (Acer rubrum) is a species of the common red\r\nmaple, but likewise very difficult to be got. You may cut down many\r\ntrees without finding the wood which you want. The wood of the sweet\r\ngum-tree (Liquidambar) is merely employed in joiner’s work, such as\r\ntables, and other furniture. But it must not be brought near the fire,\r\nbecause it warps. The firs and the white cedars (Cupressus thyoides)\r\nare likewise made use of by the joiners for different sorts of work.\r\n\r\nThe millers who attended the mill which stood here, said, that the\r\naxle-trees of the wheels of the mill were made of white oak, and that\r\nthey continued good three or four years, but that the fir-wood does not\r\nkeep so well. The cogs of the mill-wheel, and the pullies, are made of\r\nthe wood of the white walnut-tree, because it is the hardest which can\r\nbe got here. The wood of mulberry-trees is of all others reckoned the\r\nmost excellent for pegs and plugs in ships and boats.\r\n\r\nAt night I went over the river Delaware, from Willmington, to the\r\nferrying-place, on the New Jersey side.\r\n\r\nDecember the 13th. In the morning I returned to Raccoon.\r\n\r\nOn many trees in the woods of this country, either on one of the sides,\r\nor in the middle of a branch, or round a branch, are greater or lesser\r\nknobs or excrescences. Sometimes there is only a single one in a tree.\r\nIn the size there is a considerable difference, for some of these knobs\r\nare as big and bigger than a man’s head, others are only small. They\r\nproject above the surface of the tree, like a tumor. Sometimes a tree\r\nwas quite covered with them. They do not ly on one side only, but often\r\nform a circle round a branch, and even round the stem itself. The trees\r\nwhich have these knobs are not always great ones, but some not above a\r\nfathom high. The knobs commonly consist of the same parts as the wood\r\nitself, and look within like curled wood. Some of them are hollow. When\r\na knob on a little tree is cut open, we commonly find a number of\r\nlittle worms in it, which are sometimes also common in the greater\r\nknobs. This shews the origin of the knobs in general. The tree is stung\r\nby insects, which lay their eggs under the bark, and from the eggs\r\nworms are afterwards hatched. They occasion an extravasation of the\r\nsap, which gradually condenses into a knob. Only the trees with annual\r\ndeciduous leaves have these knobs, and among them chiefly the oak, of\r\nwhich again the black and Spanish oak have the greatest abundance of\r\nknobs. The ash trees, (Fraxinus excelsior) and the red maple (Acer\r\nrubrum) likewise have enough of them. Formerly the Swedes, and more\r\nespecially the Finlanders, who are settled here, made dishes, bowls,\r\n&c. of the knobs which were on the ash-trees. These vessels, I am told,\r\nwere very pretty, and looked as if they were made of curled wood. The\r\noak-knobs cannot be employed in this manner, as they are commonly\r\nworm-eaten and rotten within. At present the Swedes no longer make use\r\nof such bowls and dishes, but make use of earthen ware, or vessels made\r\nof other wood. Some knobs are of an uncommon size, and make a tree have\r\na monstrous appearance. Trees with knobs are very common in the woods\r\nof this country [4].\r\n\r\nThe roads are good or bad according to the difference of the ground. In\r\na sandy soil the roads are dry and good; but in a clayey one they are\r\nbad. The people here are likewise very careless in mending them. If a\r\nrivulet be not very great, they do not make a bridge over it; and\r\ntravellers may do as well as they can to get over: Therefore many\r\npeople are in danger of being drowned in such places, where the water\r\nis risen by a heavy rain. When a tree falls across the road, it is\r\nseldom cut off, to keep the road clear, but the people go round it.\r\nThis they can easily do, since the ground is very even, and without\r\nstones; has no underwood or shrubs, and the trees on it stand much\r\nasunder. Hence the roads here have so many bendings.\r\n\r\nThe farms are most of them single, and you seldom meet with even two\r\ntogether, except in towns, or places which are intended for towns;\r\ntherefore there are but few villages. Each farm has its corn-fields,\r\nits woods, its pastures and meadows. This may perhaps have contributed\r\nsomething towards the extirpation of wolves, that they every where met\r\nwith houses, and people who fired at them. Two or three farm-houses\r\nhave generally a pasture or a wood in common, and there are seldom more\r\ntogether; but most of them have their own grounds divided from the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nDecember the 18th. All persons who intend to be married, must either\r\nhave their banns published three times from the pulpit, or get a\r\nlicence from the governor. The banns of the poorer sort of people only\r\nare published, and all those who are a little above them get a licence\r\nfrom the governor. In that licence he declares that he has examined the\r\naffair, and found no obstacles to hinder the marriage, and therefore he\r\nallows it. The licence is signed by the governor; but, before he\r\ndelivers it, the bridegroom must come to him in company with two\r\ncreditable and well known men, who answer for him, that there really is\r\nno lawful obstacle to his marriage. These men must subscribe a\r\ncertificate, in which they make themselves answerable for, and engage\r\nto bear all the damages of, any complaints made by the relations of the\r\npersons who intend to be married, by their guardians, their masters, or\r\nby those to whom they may have been promised before. For all these\r\ncircumstances the governor cannot possibly know. They further certify\r\nthat nothing hinders the intended marriage, and that nothing is to be\r\nfeared on that account. For a licence they pay five and twenty\r\nshillings in Pensylvanian money, at Philadelphia. The governor keeps\r\ntwenty shillings, or one pound, and the remaining five shillings belong\r\nto his secretary. The licence is directed only to protestant clergymen.\r\nThe quakers have a peculiar licence to their marriages. But as it would\r\nbe very troublesome, especially for those who live far from the\r\ngovernor’s residence to come up to town for every licence, and to bring\r\nthe men with them who are to answer for them, the clergymen in the\r\ncountry commonly take a sufficient number of licences and certificates,\r\nwhich are ready printed, with blanks left for the names; they give them\r\noccasionally, and get the common money, one pound, five shillings, for\r\neach of them, besides something for their trouble. The money that they\r\nhave collected, they deliver to the governor as soon as they come to\r\ntown, together with the certificates, which are signed by two men, as\r\nabove-mentioned; they then take again as many licences as they think\r\nsufficient: from hence we may conceive that the governors in the\r\nEnglish North American colonies, besides their salaries, have very\r\nconsiderable revenues [5].\r\n\r\nThere is a great mixture of people of all sorts in these colonies,\r\npartly of such as are lately come over from Europe, and partly of such\r\nas have not yet any settled place of abode. Hence it frequently happens\r\nthat when a clergyman has married such a couple, the bridegroom says he\r\nhas no money at present, but would pay the fee at the first\r\nopportunity: however he goes off with his wife, and the clergyman never\r\ngets his due. This proceeding has given occasion to a custom which is\r\nnow common in Maryland. When the clergyman marries a very poor couple,\r\nhe breaks off in the middle of the Liturgy, and cries out Where is my\r\nfee? The man must then give the money, and the clergyman proceeds; but\r\nif the bridegroom has no money, the clergyman defers the marriage till\r\nanother time, when the man is better provided. People of fortune, of\r\nwhom the clergyman is sure to get his due, need not fear this\r\ndisagreeable question, when they are married.\r\n\r\nHowever, though the parson has got licences to marry a couple, yet if\r\nhe be not very careful, he may get into very disagreeable\r\ncircumstances; for in many parts of the country there is a law made,\r\nwhich, notwithstanding the governor’s licence, greatly limits a\r\nclergyman in some cases. He is not allowed to marry a couple who are\r\nnot yet of age, unless he be certain of the consent of their parents.\r\nHe cannot marry such strangers as have bound themselves to serve a\r\ncertain number of years, in order to pay off their passage from Europe,\r\nwithout the consent of their masters; if he acts without their consent,\r\nor in opposition to it, he must pay a penalty of fifty pounds,\r\nPensylvania currency, though he has the licence, and the certificate of\r\nthe two men who are to answer for any objection. But parents or masters\r\ngive themselves no concern about these men, but take hold of the\r\nclergyman, who is at liberty to prosecute those who gave him the\r\ncertificate, and to get his damages repaid. With the consent of the\r\nparents and masters he may marry people without danger to himself. No\r\nclergyman is allowed to marry a negro with one of European extraction,\r\nor he must pay a penalty of one hundred pounds, according to the laws\r\nof Pensylvania.\r\n\r\nThere is a very peculiar diverting custom here, in regard to marrying.\r\nWhen a man dies, and leaves his widow in great poverty, or so that she\r\ncannot pay all the debts with what little she has left, and that,\r\nnotwithstanding all that, there is a person who will marry her, she\r\nmust be married in no other habit than her shift. By that means, she\r\nleaves to the creditors of her deceased husband her cloaths, and every\r\nthing which they find in the house. But she is not obliged to pay them\r\nany thing more, because she has left them all she was worth, even her\r\ncloaths, keeping only a shift to cover her, which the laws of the\r\ncountry cannot refuse her. As soon as she is married, and no longer\r\nbelongs to the deceased husband, she puts on the cloaths which the\r\nsecond has given her. The Swedish clergymen here have often been\r\nobliged to marry a woman in a dress which is so little expensive, and\r\nso light. This appears from the registers kept in the churches, and\r\nfrom the accounts given by the clergymen themselves. I have likewise\r\noften seen accounts of such marriages in the English gazettes; which\r\nare printed in these colonies; and I particularly remember the\r\nfollowing relation: A woman went, with no other dress than her shift,\r\nout of the house of her deceased husband to that of her bridegroom, who\r\nmet her half way with fine new cloaths, and said, before all who were\r\npresent, that he lent them his bride; and put them on her with his own\r\nhands. It seems, he said that he lent the cloaths, lest, if he had said\r\nhe gave them, the creditors of the first husband should come, and take\r\nthem from her; pretending, that she was looked upon as the relict of\r\nher first husband, before she was married to the second.\r\n\r\nDecember the 21st. It seems very probable, from the following\r\nobservations, that long before the arrival of the Swedes, there have\r\nbeen Europeans in this province; and, in the sequel, we shall give more\r\nconfirmations of this opinion. The same old Maons Keen, whom I have\r\nalready mentioned before, told me repeatedly, that on the arrival of\r\nthe Swedes in the last century, and on their making a settlement,\r\ncalled Helsingburg, on the banks of the Delaware, somewhat below the\r\nplace where Salem is now situated; they found, at the depth of twenty\r\nfeet, some wells, inclosed with walls. This could not be a work of the\r\nnative Americans, or Indians, as bricks were entirely unknown to them\r\nwhen the Europeans first settled here, at the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury; and they still less knew how to make use of them. The wells\r\nwere, at that time, on the land; but in such a place, on the banks of\r\nthe Delaware, as is sometimes under water, and sometimes dry. But\r\nsince, the ground has been so washed away, that the wells are entirely\r\ncovered by the river, and the water is seldom low enough to shew the\r\nwells. As the Swedes afterwards made new wells for themselves, at some\r\ndistance from the former, they discovered, in the ground, some broken\r\nearthen vessels, and some entire good bricks; and they have often got\r\nthem out of the ground by ploughing.\r\n\r\nFrom these marks, it seems, we may conclude, that in times of yore,\r\neither Europeans or other people of the then civilized parts of the\r\nworld, have been carried hither by storms, or other accidents, settled\r\nhere, on the banks of the river, burnt bricks, and made a colony here;\r\nbut that they afterwards mixed with the Indians, or were killed by\r\nthem. They may gradually, by conversing with the Indians, have learnt\r\ntheir manners, and turn of thinking. The Swedes themselves are accused,\r\nthat they were already half Indians, when the English arrived in the\r\nyear 1682. And we still see, that the French, English, Germans, Dutch,\r\nand other Europeans, who have lived for several years together in\r\ndistant provinces, near and among the Indians, grow so like them, in\r\ntheir behaviour and thoughts, that they can only be distinguished by\r\nthe difference of their colour. But history, together with the\r\ntradition among the Indians, assures us, that the above-mentioned wells\r\nand bricks cannot have been made at the time of Columbus’s expedition,\r\nnor soon after; as the traditions of the Indians say, that those wells\r\nwere made long before that epocha. This account of the wells, which had\r\nbeen inclosed with bricks, and of such bricks as have been found in\r\nseveral places in the ground, I have afterwards heard repeated by many\r\nother old Swedes.\r\n\r\nDecember the 22nd. An old farmer foretold a change of the weather,\r\nbecause the air was very warm this day at noon, though the morning had\r\nbeen very cold. This he likewise concluded, from having observed the\r\nclouds gathering about the sun. The meteorological observations annexed\r\nto the end of this volume will prove that his observation was just.\r\n\r\nDecember the 31st. The remedies against the tooth-ach are almost as\r\nnumerous as days in a year. There is hardly an old woman but can tell\r\nyou three or four score of them, of which she is perfectly certain that\r\nthey are as infallible and speedy in giving relief, as a month’s\r\nfasting, by bread and water, is to a burthensome paunch. Yet it happens\r\noften, nay too frequently, that this painful disease eludes all this\r\nformidable army of remedies. However, I cannot forbear observing the\r\nfollowing remedies, which have sometimes, in this country, been found\r\neffectual against the tooth-ach.\r\n\r\nWhen the pains come from the hollowness of the teeth, the following\r\nremedy is said to have had a good effect: A little cotton is put at the\r\nbottom of a tobacco-pipe; the tobacco is put in upon it, and lighted;\r\nand you smoke till it is almost burnt up. By smoking, the oil of the\r\ntobacco gets into the cotton, which is then taken out, and applied to\r\nthe tooth as hot as it can be suffered.\r\n\r\nThe chief remedy of the Iroquois, or Iroquese, against the tooth-ach\r\noccasioned by hollow teeth, I heard of Captain Lindsey’s lady, at\r\nOswego; and she assured me, that she knew, from her own experience,\r\nthat the remedy was effectual. They take the seed capsules of the\r\nVirginian Anemone, as soon as the seed is ripe, and rub them in pieces.\r\nIt will then be rough, and look like cotton. This cotton-like substance\r\nis dipped into strong brandy, and then put into the hollow tooth, which\r\ncommonly ceases to ache soon after. The brandy is biting or sharp, and\r\nthe seeds of the anemone, as most seeds of the Polyandria Polygynia\r\nclass of plants (or such as have many Stamina, or male flowers, and\r\nmany Pistilla, or female flowers) have likewise an acrimony. They\r\ntherefore, both together, help to assuage the pain; and this remedy is\r\nmuch of the same kind with the former. Besides that, we have many seeds\r\nwhich have the same qualities with the American anemone.\r\n\r\nThe following remedy was much in vogue against the tooth-ach which is\r\nattended with a swelling: They boil gruel, of flour of maize, and milk;\r\nto this they add, whilst it is yet over the fire, some of the fat of\r\nhogs, or other suet, and stir it well, that every thing may mix\r\nequally. A handkerchief is then spread over the gruel, and applied as\r\nhot as possible to the swelled cheek, where it is kept till it is gone\r\ncool again. I have found, that this remedy has been very efficacious\r\nagainst a swelling as it lessens the pain, abates the swelling, opens a\r\ngathering, if there be any, and procures a good discharge of the Pus.\r\n\r\nI have seen the Iroquese boil the inner bark of the Sambucus\r\nCanadensis, or Canada Elder, and put it on that part of the cheek in\r\nwhich the pain was most violent. This, I am told, often diminishes the\r\npain.\r\n\r\nAmong the Iroquese, or Five Nations, upon the river Mohawk, I saw a\r\nyoung Indian woman, who, by frequent drinking of tea, had got a violent\r\ntooth-ach. To cure it, she boiled the Myrica asplenii folia, and tied\r\nit, as hot as she could bear it, on the whole cheek. She said, that\r\nremedy had often cured the tooth-ach before.\r\n\r\nJanuary the 2nd, 1749. Before the Europeans under the direction of\r\nColumbus, came to the West Indies, the savages or Indians (who lived\r\nthere since times immemorial) were entirely unacquainted with iron,\r\nwhich appears very strange to us, as North America, almost in every\r\npart of it, contains a number of iron mines. They were therefore\r\nobliged to supply this want with sharp stones, shells, claws of birds\r\nand wild beasts, pieces of bones, and other things of that kind,\r\nwhenever they intended to make hatchets, knives, and such like\r\ninstruments. From hence it appears, that they must have led a very\r\nwretched life. The old Swedes who lived here, and had had an\r\nintercourse with the Indians when they were young, and at a time when\r\nthey were yet very numerous in these parts, could tell a great many\r\nthings concerning their manner of living. At this time the people find\r\naccidentally, by ploughing and digging in the ground, several of the\r\ninstruments which the Indians employed, before the Swedes and other\r\nEuropeans had provided them with iron tools. For it is observable that\r\nthe Indians at present make use of no other tools, than such as are\r\nmade of iron and other metals, and which they always get from the\r\nEuropeans: Of this I shall be more particular, in its proper place. But\r\nhaving had an opportunity of seeing, and partly collecting a great many\r\nof the ancient Indian tools, I shall here describe them.\r\n\r\nTheir hatchets were made of stone. Their shape is similar to that of\r\nthe wedges with which we cleave our wood, about half a foot long, and\r\nbroad in proportion; they are made like a wedge, sharp at one end, but\r\nrather blunter than our wedges. As this hatchet must be fixed on a\r\nhandle, there was a notch made all round the thick-end. To fasten it,\r\nthey split a stick at one end, and put the stone between it, so that\r\nthe two halves of the stick come into the notches of the stone; then\r\nthey tied the two split ends together with a rope or something like it,\r\nalmost in the same way as smiths fasten the instrument with which they\r\ncut off iron, to a split stick. Some of these stone-hatchets were not\r\nnotched or furrowed at the upper end, and it seems they only held those\r\nin their hands in order to hew or strike with them, and did not make\r\nhandles to them. Most of the hatchets which I have seen, consisted of a\r\nhard rock-stone: but some were made of a fine, hard, black, apyrous\r\nstone. When the Indians intended to fell a thick strong tree, they\r\ncould not make use of their hatchets, but for want of proper\r\ninstruments employed fire. They set fire to a great quantity of wood at\r\nthe roots of the tree, and made it fall by that means. But that the\r\nfire might not reach higher than they would have it, they fastened some\r\nrags to a pole, dipped them into water, and kept continually washing\r\nthe tree, a little above the fire. Whenever they intended to hollow out\r\na thick tree for a canoe, they laid dry branches all along the stem of\r\nthe tree, as far as it must be hollowed out. They then put fire to\r\nthose dry branches, and as soon as they were burnt, they were replaced\r\nby others. Whilst these branches were burning, the Indians were very\r\nbusy with wet rags, and pouring water upon the tree, to prevent the\r\nfire from spreading too far on the sides and at the ends. The tree\r\nbeing burnt hollow as far as they found it sufficient, or as far as it\r\ncould without damaging the canoe, they took the above described\r\nstone-hatchets, or sharp flints, and quartzes, or sharp shells, and\r\nscraped off the burnt part of the wood, and smoothened the boats\r\nwithin. By this means they likewise gave it what shape they pleased.\r\nInstead of cutting with a hatchet such a piece of wood as was necessary\r\nfor making a canoe, they likewise employed fire. A canoe was commonly\r\nbetween thirty and forty feet long. The chief use of their hatchets\r\nwas, according to the unanimous accounts of all the Swedes, to make\r\ngood fields for maize-plantations; for if the ground where they\r\nintended to make a maize-field was covered with trees, they cut off the\r\nbark all round the trees with their hatchets, especially at the time\r\nwhen they lose their sap. By that means the tree became dry, and could\r\nnot take any more nourishment, and the leaves could no longer obstruct\r\nthe rays of the sun from passing. The smaller trees were then pulled\r\nout by main force, and the ground was a little turned up with crooked\r\nor sharp branches.\r\n\r\nInstead of knives they were satisfied with little sharp pieces of flint\r\nor quartz, or else some other hard kind of a stone, or with a sharp\r\nshell, or with a piece of a bone which they had sharpened.\r\n\r\nAt the end of their arrows they fastened narrow angulated pieces of\r\nstone; they made use of them, having no iron to make them sharp again,\r\nor a wood of sufficient hardness: these points were commonly flints or\r\nquartzes, but sometimes likewise another kind of a stone. Some employed\r\nthe bones of animals, or the claws of birds and beasts. Some of these\r\nancient harpoons are very blunt, and it seems that the Indians might\r\nkill birds and small quadrupeds with them; but whether they could enter\r\ndeep into the body of a great beast or of a man, by the velocity which\r\nthey get from the bow, I cannot ascertain; yet some have been found\r\nvery sharp and well made.\r\n\r\nThey had stone pestles, about a foot long, and as thick as a man’s arm.\r\nThey consist chiefly of a black sort of a stone, and were formerly\r\nemployed, by the Indians, for pounding maize, which has, since times\r\nimmemorial, been their chief and almost their only corn. They had\r\nneither wind-mills, water-mills, nor hand-mills, to grind it, and did\r\nnot so much as know a mill, before the Europeans came into the country.\r\nI have spoken with old Frenchmen, in Canada, who told me, that the\r\nIndians had been astonished beyond expression, when the French set up\r\nthe first wind-mill. They came in numbers, even from the most distant\r\nparts, to view this wonder, and were not tired with sitting near it for\r\nseveral days together, in order to observe it; they were long of\r\nopinion that it was not driven by the wind, but by the spirits who\r\nlived within it. They were partly under the same astonishment when the\r\nfirst water-mill was built. They formerly pounded all their corn or\r\nmaize in hollow trees, with the above-mentioned pestles, made of stone.\r\nMany Indians had only wooden pestles. The blackish stone, of which the\r\nhatchets and pestles are sometimes made, is very good for a grindstone,\r\nand therefore both the English and the Swedes employ the hatchets and\r\npestles chiefly as grindstones, at present, when they can get them.\r\n\r\nThe old boilers or kettles of the Indians, were either made of clay, or\r\nof different kinds of pot-stone, (Lapis ollaris). The former consisted\r\nof a dark clay, mixt with grains of white sand or quartz, and burnt in\r\nthe fire. Many of these kettles have two holes in the upper margin, on\r\neach side one, through which the Indians put a stick, and held the\r\nkettle over the fire, as long as it was to boil. Most of the kettles\r\nhave no feet. It is remarkable that no pots of this kind have been\r\nfound glazed, either on the outside or the inside. A few of the oldest\r\nSwedes could yet remember seeing the Indians boil their meat in these\r\npots. They are very thin, and of different sizes; they are made\r\nsometimes of a greenish, and sometimes of a grey pot-stone, and some\r\nare made of another species of apyrous stone; the bottom and the margin\r\nare frequently above an inch thick. The Indians, notwithstanding their\r\nbeing unacquainted with iron, steel, and other metals, have learnt to\r\nhollow out very ingeniously these pots or kettles of pot-stone.\r\n\r\nThe old tobacco-pipes of the Indians are likewise made of clay, or\r\npot-stone, or serpentine-stone. The first sort are shaped like our\r\ntobacco-pipes, though much coarser and not so well made. The tube is\r\nthick and short, hardly an inch long, but sometimes as long as a\r\nfinger; their colour comes nearest to that of our tobacco-pipes which\r\nhave been long used. Their tobacco-pipes of pot-stone are made of the\r\nsame stone as their kettles. Some of them are pretty well made, though\r\nthey had neither iron nor steel. But besides these kinds of\r\ntobacco-pipes, we find another sort of pipes, which are made with great\r\ningenuity, of a very fine, red pot-stone, or a kind of serpentine\r\nmarble. They are very scarce, and seldom made use of by any other than\r\nthe Indian Sachems, or elders. The fine red stone, of which these pipes\r\nare made, is likewise very scarce, and is found only in the country of\r\nthose Indians who are called Ingouez, and who, according to father\r\nCharlevoix, live on the other side of the river Missisippi [6]. The\r\nIndians themselves commonly value a pipe of this kind as much as a\r\npiece of silver of the same size, and sometimes they make it still\r\ndearer. Of the same kind of stone commonly consists their pipe of\r\npeace, which the French call calumet de paix, and which they make use\r\nof in their treaties of peace, and alliances. Most authors who have\r\nwrote of these nations mention this instrument, and I intend to speak\r\nof it when an opportunity offers.\r\n\r\nThe Indians employ hooks made of bone, or bird’s claws, instead of\r\nfishing-hooks. Some of the oldest Swedes here told me, that when they\r\nwere young, a great number of Indians had been in this part of the\r\ncountry, which was then called New Sweden, and had caught fishes in the\r\nriver Delaware, with these hooks.\r\n\r\nThey made fire by rubbing one end of a hard piece of wood continually\r\nagainst another dry one, till the wood began to smoke, and afterwards\r\nto burn.\r\n\r\nSuch were the tools of the antient Indians, and the use which they made\r\nof them, before the Europeans invaded this country, and before they\r\n(the Indians) were acquainted with the advantages of iron. North\r\nAmerica abounds in iron-mines, and the Indians lived all about the\r\ncountry before the arrival of the Europeans, so that several places can\r\nbe shewn in this country, where at present there are iron-mines, and\r\nwhere, not a hundred years ago, stood great towns or villages of the\r\nIndians. It is therefore very remarkable that the Indians did not know\r\nhow to make use of a metal or ore which was always under their eyes,\r\nand on which they could not avoid treading every day. They even lived\r\nupon the very spots where iron ores were afterwards found, and yet they\r\noften went many miles in order to get a wretched hatchet, knife, or the\r\nlike, as above described. They were forced to employ several days in\r\norder to sharpen their tools, by rubbing them against a rock, or other\r\nstones, though the advantage was far from being equal to the labour.\r\nFor they could never cut down a thick tree with their hatchets, and\r\nwith difficulty they felled a small one. They could not hollow out a\r\ntree with their hatchets, or do a hundredth part of the work which we\r\ncan perform with ease, by the help of our iron hatchets. Thus we see\r\nhow disadvantageous the ignorance and inconsiderate contempt of useful\r\narts is. Happy is the country which knows their full value!\r\n\r\nJanuary the 5th. Christmas-day was celebrated this day by the Swedes\r\nand English, for they kept then to the old stile.\r\n\r\nJanuary the 6th. There are a great number of hares in this country, but\r\nthey differ from our Swedish ones in their size, which is very small,\r\nand but little bigger than that of a rabbit; they keep almost the same\r\ngrey colour both in summer and winter, which our Northern hares have in\r\nsummer only; the tip of their ears is always grey, and not black; the\r\ntail is likewise grey on the upper side, at all seasons; they breed\r\nseveral times a year: in spring they lodge their young ones in hollow\r\ntrees, and in summer, in the months of June and July, they breed in the\r\ngrass. When they are surprised they commonly take refuge in hollow\r\ntrees, out of which they are taken by means of a crooked stick, or by\r\ncutting a hole into the tree, opposite to the place where they lie; or\r\nby smoke, which is occasioned by making a fire on the outside of the\r\ntree. On all these occasions the greyhounds must be at hand. These\r\nhares never bite, and can be touched without any danger. In day-time\r\nthey usually lie in hollow trees, and hardly ever stir from thence,\r\nunless they be disturbed by men or dogs; but in the night they come\r\nout, and seek their food. In bad weather, or when it snows, they lie\r\nclose for a day or two, and do not venture to leave their retreats.\r\nThey do a great deal of mischief in the cabbage-fields; but apple-trees\r\nsuffer infinitely more from them, for they peel off all the bark next\r\nto the ground. The people here agreed that the hares are fatter in a\r\ncold and severe winter, than in a mild and wet one, of which they could\r\ngive me several reasons, from their own conjectures. The skin is\r\nuseless, because it is so loose, that it can be drawn off; for when you\r\nwould separate it from the flesh, you need only pull at the fur, and\r\nthe skin follows: these hares cannot be tamed. They were at all times,\r\neven in the midst of winter, plagued with a number of common fleas [7].\r\n\r\nJanuary the 16th. The common mice were in great abundance in the towns\r\nand in the country; they do as much mischief as in the old countries.\r\nOldmixon in his book, the British Empire in America, vol. i. p. 444,\r\nwrites, that North America had neither rats nor mice before European\r\nships brought them over. How far this is true I know not. It is\r\nundoubted, that in several desart places, where no man ever lived, I\r\nhave seen and killed the common mice, in crevices of stones or\r\nmountains; and is it probable that all such mice as are spread in this\r\nmanner, throughout the inland parts of the country, derive their origin\r\nfrom those which were brought over from Europe?\r\n\r\nRats likewise may be ranked among those animals which do great damage\r\nin this country. They live both in the cities and in the country, and\r\ndestroy the provisions. Their size is the same with that of our rats,\r\nbut their colour differs; for they are grey, or blue-grey. I enquired\r\nof the Swedes, Whether these rats had been here prior to the arrival of\r\nthe Europeans, or whether they came over in the ships? But I could not\r\nget an answer which I might depend upon. All agreed, that a number of\r\nthese dangerous and mischievous animals were every year brought to\r\nAmerica, by ships from Europe and other countries. But Mr. Bartram\r\nmaintained, that before the Europeans settled here, rats had been in\r\nthe country; for he saw a great number of them on the high mountains,\r\nwhich are commonly called the Blue Mountains, where they lived among\r\nstones, and in the subterraneous grottoes which are in those mountains.\r\nThey always lie very close in the day-time, and you hardly ever see one\r\nout; but at night they come out, and make a terrible noise. When the\r\ncold was very violent, they seemed quite torpid; for during the\r\ncontinuance of the cold weather, one could not hear the least noise, or\r\nshrieking, occasioned by them. It is to be observed, that neither the\r\nSwedes nor the English have any dark windows in their houses here.\r\nThere is hardly a dormer-window in the garret; but only loose boards.\r\nThe walls in the wooden houses are frequently not closed, even with\r\nmoss; so that the rooms, though they have fires in them, are no warmer\r\nthan the outside apartment, or hall. The rooms where the servants sleep\r\nhave never any fire in them, though the winter is pretty severe\r\nsometimes. The rats have, therefore, little or no warmth in winter; but\r\nas soon as a milder season makes its appearance, they come out again.\r\nWe observed several times this winter, that the rats were very active,\r\nand made an unusual noise all night, just before a severe cold. It\r\nseems, they had some sensation of cold weather being at hand; and that\r\nthey therefore eat sufficiently, or stored up provisions. In mild\r\nweather, they were used to carry away apples, and other provisions:\r\ntherefore, we could always conclude, with certainty, when the rats made\r\nan uncommon noise at night, or were extremely greedy, that a severe\r\ncold would ensue. I have already observed in the preceding volume, p.\r\n312, that the grey squirrels in this country have the same quality.\r\nWhen these, and the common mice, eat maize, they do not consume the\r\nwhole grains, but only the loose, sweet and soft kernel, and leave the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nJanuary the 21st. The cold now equalled that of Sweden, though this\r\ncountry is so much more southerly. The Celsian or Swedish thermometer\r\nwas twenty-two degrees below the freezing point, in the morning. As the\r\nrooms are without any shutters here, the cracks in the walls not closed\r\nwith moss, and sometimes no fire-place or chimney in the room, the\r\nwinters here must be very disagreeable to one who is used to our\r\nSwedish warm winter-rooms. But the greatest comfort here is, that the\r\ncold is of a very short duration. Some days of this month, the room\r\nwhich I lodged in was such, that I could not write two lines before the\r\nink would freeze in my pen. When I did not write, I could not leave the\r\nink-stand on the table; but was forced to put it upon the hearth, or\r\ninto my pocket. Yet, notwithstanding it was so cold, as appears from\r\nthe meteorological observations at the end of this volume, and though\r\nit snowed sometimes for several days and nights together, and the snow\r\nlay near six inches high upon the ground, yet all the cattle are\r\nobliged to stay, day and night, in the fields, during the whole winter.\r\nFor neither the English nor the Swedes had any stables; but the Germans\r\nand Dutch had preserved the custom of their country, and generally kept\r\ntheir cattle in stables during winter. Almost all the old Swedes say,\r\nthat on their first arrival in this country, they made stables for\r\ntheir cattle, as is usual in Sweden; but as the English came, and\r\nsettled among them, and left their cattle in the fields all winter, as\r\nis customary in England, they left off their former custom, and adopted\r\nthe English one. They owned, however, that the cattle suffered greatly\r\nin winter, when it was very cold, especially when it froze after a\r\nrain, and that some cattle were killed by it in several places, in the\r\nlong winter of the year 1741. About noon, the cattle went out into the\r\nwoods, where there were yet some leaves on the young oak; but they did\r\nnot eat the leaves, and only bit off the extremities of the branches,\r\nand the tops of the youngest oaks. The horses went into the maize\r\nfields, and ate the dry leaves on the few stalks which remained. The\r\nsheep ran about the woods, and on the corn fields. The chickens perched\r\non the trees of the gardens, at night; for they had no particular\r\nhabitations. The hogs were likewise exposed to the roughness of the\r\nweather, within a small inclosure.\r\n\r\nA small kind of birds, which the Swedes call Snow-bird, and the English\r\nChuck-bird, came into the houses about this time. At other times, they\r\nsought their food along the roads. They are seldom seen, but when it\r\nsnows. Catesby, in his Natural History of Carolina, calls it Passer\r\nnivalis; and Dr. Linnæus, in his Systema Naturæ, calls it Emberiza\r\nhyemalis.\r\n\r\nThe river Delaware was now covered with ice opposite Philadelphia, and\r\neven somewhat lower, and the people could walk over it; but nobody\r\nventured to ride over on horseback.\r\n\r\nJanuary the 22d. There are partridges in this country; but they are not\r\nof the same kind with ours. The Swedes called them sometimes rapphons\r\n(partridges), and sometimes aekkerhoens (quails). Some of the English\r\nlikewise called them partridges, others quails. Their shape is almost\r\nthe same with that of the European partridges, and their nature and\r\nqualities the same: I mean, they run and hide themselves, when pursued.\r\nBut they are smaller, and entirely different in colour. In this work I\r\ncannot insert, at large, the descriptions which I have made of birds,\r\ninsects, quadrupeds, and plants; because it would swell my volume too\r\nmuch. I only observe, that the feet are naked, and not hairy; the back\r\nis spotted with brown, black, and white; the breast is dark yellow; and\r\nthe belly whitish, with black edges on the tips of the feathers. The\r\nsize is nearly that of a hazel-hen, or tetrao bonasia. Above each eye\r\nis a narrow stroke of whitish yellow. These birds are numerous in New\r\nSweden, i. e. this part of the country. On going but a little way, you\r\nmeet with great coveys of them. However, they keep at a great distance\r\nfrom towns; being either extirpated, or frightened there by the\r\nfrequent shooting. They are always in lesser or greater coveys, do not\r\nfly very much, but run in the fields, and keep under the bushes and\r\nnear the inclosures, where they seek their food. They are reckoned very\r\ndelicious food; and the people here prepare them in different ways. For\r\nthat purpose they are caught, and shot in great numbers. They are\r\ncaught by putting up a sieve, or a square open box, made of boards, in\r\nthe places they frequent. The people strew some oats under the sieve,\r\nand lift it up on one side by a little stick; and as soon as the\r\npartridges are got under the sieve, in order to pick up the oats, it\r\nfalls, and they are caught alive. Sometimes they get several partridges\r\nat once. When they run in the bushes, you can come very near them,\r\nwithout starting them. When they sleep at night, they come together in\r\nan heap. They scratch in the bushes and upon the field, like common\r\nchickens. In spring they make their nests, either under a bush or in\r\nthe maize fields, or on the hills in the open air: they scratch some\r\nhay together, into which they lay about thirteen white eggs. They eat\r\nseveral sorts of corn, and seeds of grass. They have likewise been seen\r\neating the berries of sumach, or rhus glabra. Some people have taken\r\nthem young, and kept them in a cage till they were tame: then they let\r\nthem go; and they followed the chickens, and never left the\r\ncourt-yards.\r\n\r\nThe inclosures made use of in Pensylvania and New Jersey, but\r\nespecially in New York, are those, which on account of their serpentine\r\nform resembling worms, are called worm-fences in English. The poles\r\nwhich compose this fence are taken from different trees; but they are\r\nnot all of equal duration: the red cedar is reckoned the most durable\r\nof any, for it holds out above thirty years; but it is very scarce, and\r\ngrows only in a single place hereabouts, so that no fences can be made\r\nof it. It is true, the fences about Philadelphia (which however are\r\ndifferent from the worm-fences) are all made of red cedar; but it has\r\nbeen brought by water from Egg-harbour, where it grows in abundance.\r\nThe supports on which the poles lie are made of the white cedar, or\r\nCupressus thyoides, and the poles which are laid between them of the\r\nred cedar or Juniperus Virginiana. Next to the cedar-wood, oak and\r\nchesnut are reckoned best. Chesnut is commonly preferred, but it is not\r\nevery where so plentiful as to be made into fences; in its stead they\r\nmake use of several sorts of oak. In order to make inclosures, the\r\npeople do not cut down the young trees, as is common with us, but they\r\nfell here and there thick trees, cut them in several places, leaving\r\nthe pieces as long as it is necessary, and split them into poles of the\r\nusual thickness; a single tree affords a multitude of poles. Several\r\nold men in this country told me, that the Swedes on their arrival here,\r\nmade such inclosures as are usual in Sweden, but they were forced to\r\nleave off in a few years time, because they could not get posts enough;\r\nfor they had found by experience that a post being put into the ground\r\nwould not last above four or six years before the part under ground was\r\nentirely rotten; but the chief thing was, that they could not get any\r\nswitches for to tie them together; they made some of hiccory, which is\r\none of the toughest trees in this country, and of the white oak; but in\r\nthe space of a year or two the switches were rotten, and the fence fell\r\nin pieces of itself, therefore they were forced to give over making\r\nsuch inclosures. Several of the new comers again attempted, but with\r\nthe same bad success, to make fences with posts and switches. The\r\nSwedish way of inclosing therefore will not succeed here. Thus the\r\nworm-fences are one of the most useful sorts of inclosures, especially\r\nas they cannot get any post, made of the woods of this country, to stay\r\nabove six or eight years in the ground without rotting. The poles in\r\nthis country are very heavy, and the posts cannot bear them well,\r\nespecially when it blows a storm; but the worm-fences are easily put up\r\nagain, when they are thrown down. Experience has shewn that an\r\ninclosure made of chesnut or white oak seldom holds out above ten or\r\ntwelve years, before the poles and posts are thoroughly rotten: when\r\nthe poles are made of other wood, the fences hardly stand six or eight\r\nyears. Considering how much more wood the worm-fences require, (since\r\nthey run in bendings) than other inclosures which go in strait lines,\r\nand that they are so soon useless, one may imagine how the forests will\r\nbe consumed, and what sort of an appearance the country will have forty\r\nor fifty years hence, in case no alteration is made; especially as wood\r\nis really squandered away in immense quantities, day and night all the\r\nwinter, or nearly one half of the year, for fewel.\r\n\r\nFebruary the 8th. The Musk-rats, so called by the English in this\r\ncountry, on account of their scent, are pretty common in North America;\r\nthey always live near the water, especially on the banks of lakes,\r\nrivers, and brooks. On travelling to places where they are, you see the\r\nholes which they have dug in the ground just at the water’s edge, or a\r\nlittle above its surface. In these holes they have their nests, and\r\nthere they continue whenever they are not in the water in pursuit of\r\nfood. The Swedes call them Désmans Rattor [8], and the French, Rats\r\nmusqués. Linnæus calls this animal Castor Zibethicus. Their food is\r\nchiefly the muscles which ly at the bottom of lakes and rivers; you see\r\na number of such shells near the entrance of their holes. I am told\r\nthey likewise eat several kinds of roots and plants. They differ from\r\nthe European Musk-rat, or Linnæus’s Castor Moschatus. The teeth are the\r\nsame in both; the tail of the American is compressed on the sides so,\r\nthat one sharp edge goes upwards and the other downwards: the hind feet\r\nare not palmated, or joined by a moveable skin, but are peculiar for\r\nhaving on both sides of the feet, long, white, close, pectinated,\r\noff-standing hair, besides the short hair with which the feet are quite\r\ncovered. Such hairs are on both sides of the toes, and do the same\r\nservice in swimming as a web. Their size is that of a little cat, or to\r\nbe more accurate, the length of the body is about ten inches, and the\r\ntail of the same length: the colour of the head, neck, back, sides, and\r\nof the outside of the thighs, is blackish brown; the hairs are soft and\r\nshining; under the neck, on the breasts, and on the inside of the\r\nthighs, they are grey. They make their nests in the dykes that are\r\nerected along the banks of rivers to keep off the water from the\r\nadjoining meadows; but they often do a great deal of damage, by\r\nspoiling the dykes with digging, and opening passages for the water to\r\ncome into the meadows; whereas Beavers stop up all the holes in a dyke\r\nor bank. They make their nests of twigs and such like things\r\nexternally, and carry soft stuff into them for their young ones to ly\r\nupon. The Swedes asserted that they could never observe a diminution in\r\ntheir number, but believed that they were as numerous at present as\r\nformerly. As they damage the banks so considerably, the people are\r\nendeavouring to extirpate them, when they can find out their nests; the\r\nskin is paid for, and this is an encouragement towards catching the\r\nanimal. A skin of a Musk-rat formerly cost but three-pence, but at\r\npresent they gave from six-pence to nine-pence. The skins are chiefly\r\nemployed by hatters, who make hats of the hair, which are said to be\r\nnearly as good as Beaver hats. The Musk-rats are commonly caught in\r\ntraps, with apples as baits. In the country of the Iroquese, I saw\r\nthose Indians following the holes of the Musk-rats by digging till they\r\ncame to their nests, where they killed them all. Nobody here eats their\r\nflesh; I do not know whether the Indians eat it, for they are commonly\r\nnot over nice in the choice of meat. The musk-bag is put between the\r\ncloaths in order to preserve them against worms. It is very difficult\r\nto extirpate these Rats when they are once settled in a bank. A Swede,\r\nhowever, told me, that he had freed his bank, or piece of dyke along\r\nthe river, from them in the following manner: He sought for all their\r\nholes, stopped them all up with earth, excepting one, on that side from\r\nwhence the wind came. He put a quantity of sulphur into the open\r\nentrance, set fire to it, and then closed the hole, leaving but a small\r\none for the wind to pass through. The smoke of the sulphur then entered\r\ntheir most remote nests, and stifled all the animals. As soon as the\r\nsulphur was burnt, he was obliged to dig up part of the ground in the\r\nbank, where they had their nests; and he found them lie dead by heaps.\r\nHe sold the skins, and they paid his trouble, not to mention the\r\nadvantage he got by clearing his bank of the Musk-rats.\r\n\r\nBeavers were formerly abundant in New Sweden, as all the old Swedes\r\nhere told me. At that time they saw one bank after another raised in\r\nthe rivers by beavers. But after the Europeans came over in great\r\nnumber, and cultivated the country better, the beavers have been partly\r\nkilled, and partly extirpated, and partly are removed higher into the\r\ncountry, where the people are not so numerous. Therefore there is but a\r\nsingle place in Pensylvania where beavers are to be met with; their\r\nchief food is the bark of the beaver-tree, or Magnolia glauca, which\r\nthey prefer to any other. The Swedes therefore put branches of this\r\ntree near the beaver-dykes, into traps, which they laid for the\r\nbeavers, whilst they were yet plentiful; and they could almost be\r\ncertain of good success. Some persons in Philadelphia have tamed\r\nbeavers, so that they go a fishing with them, and they always come back\r\nto their masters. Major Roderfert, in New York, related that he had a\r\ntame beaver above half a year in his house, where he went about quite\r\nloose, like a dog. The major gave him bread, and sometimes fish, which\r\nhe was very greedy of. He got as much water in a bowl as he wanted. All\r\nthe rags and soft things he could meet with he dragged into a corner,\r\nwhere he was used to sleep, and made a bed of them. The cat in the\r\nhouse, having kittens, took possession of his bed, and he did not\r\nhinder her. When the cat went out, the beaver often took the kitten\r\nbetween his fore paws and held it to his breast to warm it, and doated\r\nupon it; as soon as the cat returned he gave her the kitten again.\r\nSometimes he grumbled, but never did any hurt, or attempted to bite.\r\n\r\nThe English and the Swedes gave the name of Mink to an animal of this\r\ncountry, which likewise lives either in the water, or very near it. I\r\nhave never had an opportunity to see any more than the skin of this\r\nanimal. But the shape of the skin, and the unanimous accounts I have\r\nheard of it, make me conclude with much certainty, that it belonged to\r\nthe genus of weasels or mustelæ. The greatest skin I ever saw, was one\r\nfoot, eight inches long, a lesser one was about ten inches long, and\r\nabout three inches, one third broad, before it was cut; the colour was\r\ndark brown, and sometimes almost black; the tail was bushy, as that of\r\na marten; the hair was very close; and the ears short, with short hair.\r\nThe length of the feet belonging to the lesser skin was about two\r\ninches long. I am told this animal is so similar to the American\r\npolecat, or Viverra putorius, that they are hardly distinguishable [9].\r\nI have had the following accounts given me of its way of living; it\r\nseldom appears in day-time, but at night it comes out of the hollow\r\ntrees, on the banks of rivers. Sometimes it lives in the docks and\r\nbridges, at Philadelphia, where it is a cruel enemy to the rats.\r\nSometimes it gets into the court-yards at night, and creeps into the\r\nchicken-house, through a small hole, where it kills all the poultry,\r\nand sucks their blood, but seldom eats one. If it meets with geese,\r\nfowls, ducks, or other birds on the road, it kills and devours them. It\r\nlives upon fish and birds. When a brook is near the houses, it is not\r\neasy to keep ducks and geese, for the mink, which lives near rivers,\r\nkills the young ones. It first kills as many as it can come at, and\r\nthen it carries them off, and feasts upon them. In banks and dykes near\r\nthe water, it likewise does mischief, with digging. To catch it the\r\npeople put up traps, into which they put heads of birds, fishes, or\r\nother meat. The skin is sold in the towns, and at Philadelphia; they\r\ngive twenty-pence and even two shillings a-piece for them, according to\r\ntheir size. Some of the ladies get muffs made of these skins; but for\r\nthe greatest part they are sent over to England, from whence they are\r\ndistributed to other countries. The old Swedes told me that the Indians\r\nformerly used to eat all kinds of flesh, except that of the mink.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned something of the Raccoon; I shall here add\r\nmore of the nature of this animal, in a place which is properly its\r\nnative country [10]. The English call it every where by the name of\r\nRaccoon, which name they have undoubtedly taken from one of the Indian\r\nnations; the Dutch call it Hespan, the Swedes, Espan, and the Iroquese,\r\nAttigbro. It commonly lodges in hollow trees, lies close in the\r\nday-time, never going out but on a dark, cloudy day; but at night it\r\nrambles and seeks its food. I have been told by several people, that in\r\nbad weather, especially when it snows and blows a storm, the Raccoon\r\nlies in its hole for a week together without coming out once; during\r\nthat time it lives by sucking and licking its paws. Its food are\r\nseveral sorts of fruit, such as maize, whilst the ears are soft. In\r\ngardens it often does a great deal of damage among the apples,\r\nchesnuts, plumbs, and wild grapes, which are what it likes best; among\r\nthe poultry it is very cruel. When it finds the hens on their eggs, it\r\nfirst kills them, and then eats the eggs. It is caught by dogs, which\r\ntrace it back to its nest, in hollow trees, or by snares and traps, in\r\nwhich a chicken, some other bird, or a fish, is put as a bait. Some\r\npeople eat its flesh. It leaps with all its feet at once; on account of\r\nthis and of several other qualities, many people here reckoned it to\r\nthe genus of bears. The skin sold for eighteen-pence, at Philadelphia.\r\nI was told that the Raccoons were not near so numerous as they were\r\nformerly; yet in the more inland parts they were abundant. I have\r\nmentioned the use which the hatters make of their furs; as likewise\r\nthat they are easily tamed, that they are very greedy of sweet-meats,\r\n&c. in the preceding volume. Of all the North American wild quadrupeds\r\nnone can be tamed to such a degree as this.\r\n\r\nFebruary the 10th. In the morning I went to Philadelphia, where I\r\narrived towards night. On my arrival at the ferry upon the river\r\nDelaware, I found the river quite covered with drifts of ice, which at\r\nfirst prevented our crossing the water. After waiting about an hour,\r\nand making an opening near the ferry, I, together with many more\r\npassengers, got over, before any more shoals came on. As it began to\r\nfreeze very hard soon after the twelfth of January (or New Year,\r\naccording to the old style) the river Delaware was covered with ice,\r\nwhich by the intenseness of the frost grew so strong, that the people\r\ncrossed the river with horses at Philadelphia. The ice continued till\r\nthe eighth of February, when it began to get loose, and the violent\r\nhurricane, which happened that night, broke it, and it was driven down\r\nso fast, that on the twelfth of February not a single shoal came down,\r\nexcepting a piece or two near the shore.\r\n\r\nCrows flew in great numbers together to-day, and settled on the tops of\r\ntrees. During the whole winter we hardly observed one, though they are\r\nsaid to winter there. During all this spring they commonly used to sit\r\nat the tops of trees in the morning; yet not all together, but in\r\nseveral trees. They belong to the noxious birds in this part of the\r\nworld, for they chiefly live upon corn. After the maize is planted or\r\nsown, they scratch the grains out of the ground and eat them. When the\r\nmaize begins to ripen, they peck a hole into the involucrum which\r\nsurrounds the ear, by which means the maize is spoiled, as the rain\r\npasses through the hole which they have made, and occasions the\r\nputrefaction of the corn. Besides eating corn, they likewise steal\r\nchickens. They are very fond of dead carcasses. Some years ago the\r\ngovernment of Pensylvania had given three-pence, and that of New Jersey\r\nfour-pence premium for every head of a Crow, but this law has now been\r\nrepealed, as the expences are too great. I have seen the young Crows of\r\nthis kind in several places playing with tame ones whose wings were\r\ncut. The latter hopped about the fields, near the farm-houses where\r\nthey belonged to, but always returned again, without endeavouring to\r\nescape on any occasion. These American Crows are only a variety of the\r\nRoyston Crow, or Linnæus’s Corvus Cornix.\r\n\r\nFebruary the 12th. In the afternoon I returned to Raccoon from\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nOn my journey to Raccoon, I attentively observed the trees which had\r\nyet any leaves left. The leaves were pale and dried up, but not all\r\ndropt from the following trees:\r\n\r\nThe Beach-tree, (Fagus sylvatica) whether great or small; it always\r\nkept a considerable part of its leaves during the whole winter even\r\ntill spring. The greater trees kept the lowermost leaves.\r\n\r\nThe white oak (Quercus alba). Most of the young trees which were not\r\nabove a quarter of a yard in diameter, had the greatest part of their\r\nleaves still on them, but the old trees had lost most of theirs, except\r\nin some places where they have got new shoots. The colour of the dry\r\nleaves was much paler in the white oak than in the black one.\r\n\r\nThe black oak (as it is commonly called here). Dr. Linnæus calls it the\r\nred oak, Quercus rubra. Most of the young trees still preserved their\r\ndried leaves. Their colour was reddish brown, and darker than that of\r\nthe white oak.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish oak, which is a mere variety of the black oak. The young\r\ntrees of this kind likewise keep their leaves.\r\n\r\nA scarce species of oak which is known by its leaves having a\r\ntriangular apex or top, whose angles terminate in a short bristle; the\r\nleaves are smooth below, but woolly above [11]. The young oaks of this\r\nspecies had still their leaves.\r\n\r\nWhen I came into any wood where the above kinds of oaks were only\r\ntwenty years, and even not so old, I always found the leaves on them.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Providence has, besides other views, aimed to protect\r\nseveral sorts of birds, it being very cold and stormy about this time,\r\nby preserving even the dry leaves on these trees. I have this winter at\r\nseveral times seen birds hiding in the trees covered with old leaves\r\nduring a severe cold or storm.\r\n\r\nFebruary the 13th. As I began to dig a hole to-day, I found several\r\ninsects which were crept deep into the ground in order to pass the\r\nwinter. As soon as they came to the air, they moved their limbs a\r\nlittle, but had not strength sufficient for creeping, except the black\r\nants, which crept a little, though slowly.\r\n\r\nFormica nigra, or the black ant, were pretty numerous, and somewhat\r\nlively. They lay about ten inches below the surface.\r\n\r\nCarabus latus. Some of these lay at the same depth with the ants. This\r\nis a very common insect in all North America.\r\n\r\nScarabæus; chesnut-coloured, with a hairy thorax; the elytræ shorter\r\nthan the abdomen, with several longitudinal lines, beset with hair. It\r\nis something similar to the cock-chaffer, but differs in many respects.\r\nI found it very abundant in the ground.\r\n\r\nGryllus campestris, or the field-cricket: They lay ten inches deep;\r\nthey were quite torpid, but as soon as they came into a warm place they\r\nrevived and were quite lively. In summer I have found these crickets in\r\ngreat plenty in all parts of North America where I have been. They\r\nleaped about on the fields, and made a noise like that of our common\r\nhouse-crickets, so that it would be difficult to distinguish them by\r\ntheir chirping. They sometimes make so great a noise, that it causes\r\npain in the ears, and even two people cannot understand each other. In\r\nsuch places where the rattle-snakes live, the field-crickets are very\r\ndisagreeable, and in a manner dangerous, for their violent chirping\r\nprevents the warning, which that horrid snake gives with its rattle,\r\nfrom reaching the ear, and thus deprives one of the means of avoiding\r\nit. I have already mentioned that they likewise winter sometimes in\r\nchimnies [12]. Here they ly all winter in the ground, but at the\r\nbeginning of March, as the air was grown warm, they came out of their\r\nholes, and began their music, though at first it was but very faint and\r\nrarely heard. When we were forced on our travels to sleep in\r\nuninhabited places, the crickets had got into the folds of our clothes,\r\nso that we were obliged to stop an hour every morning in examining our\r\nclothes, before we could get rid of them.\r\n\r\nThe red ants (Formica rufa) which in Sweden make the great ant-hills, I\r\nlikewise found to-day and the following day; they were not in the\r\nground, for when my servant Yungstroem cut down old dry trees, he met\r\nwith a number of them in the cracks of the tree. These cracks were at\r\nthe height of many yards in the tree, and the ants were crept so high,\r\nin order to find their winter habitation: As soon as they came into a\r\nwarm place, they began to stir about very briskly.\r\n\r\nFebruary the 14th. The Swedes and the English gave the name of blue\r\nbird to a very pretty little bird, which was of a fine blue colour.\r\nLinnæus calls it Motacilla Sialis. Catesby has drawn it in his Natural\r\nhistory of Carolina, vol. I. pl. 47, and described it by the name of\r\nRubecula Americana cærulea; and Edwards has represented it in his\r\nNatural history of birds, plate and page 24. In my own journal I called\r\nit Motacilla cærulea nitida, pectore rufo, ventre albo. In Catesby’s\r\nplate I must observe, that the colour of the breast ought to be dirty\r\nred or ferruginous; the tibiæ and feet black as jet; the bill too\r\nshould be quite black; the blue colour in general ought to be much\r\ndeeper, more lively and shining; no bird in Sweden has so shining and\r\ndeep a blue colour as this: The jay has perhaps a plumage like it. The\r\nfood of the blue bird is not merely insects, he likewise feeds upon\r\nplants; therefore in winter, when no insects are to be met with, they\r\ncome to the farm-houses in order to subsist on the seeds of hay, and\r\nother small grains.\r\n\r\nRed-bird is another species of small bird. Catesby has likewise figured\r\nit [13]. Dr. Linnæus calls it, Loxia Cardinalis. It belongs to that\r\nclass of birds which are enemies to bees, lying in wait for them and\r\neating them. I fed a cock for five months together in a cage; it eat\r\nboth maize and buck-wheat, for I gave it nothing else. By its song it\r\nattracted others of its species to the court-yard, and after we had put\r\nsome maize on the ground under the window where I had it, the others\r\ncame there every day to get their food; it was then easy to catch them\r\nby means of traps. Some of them, especially old ones, both cocks and\r\nhens, would die with grief on being put into cages. Those on the other\r\nhand which were grown tame, began to sing exceedingly sweet. Their note\r\nvery nearly resembles that of our European nightingale, and on account\r\nof their agreeable song, they are sent abundantly to London, in cages.\r\nThey have such strength in their bill that when you hold your hand to\r\nthem they pinch it so hard as to cause the blood to issue forth. In\r\nspring they sit warbling on the tops of the highest trees in the woods,\r\nin the morning. But in cages they sit quite still for an hour; the next\r\nhour they hop up and down, singing; and so they go on alternately all\r\nday.\r\n\r\nFebruary the 17th. Cranes (Ardea Canadensis) were sometimes seen flying\r\nin the day-time, to the northward. They commonly stop here early in\r\nspring, for a short time, but they do not make their nests here, for\r\nthey proceed on more to the north. Certain old Swedes told me, that in\r\ntheir younger years, as the country was not yet much cultivated, an\r\nincredible number of cranes were here every spring; but at present they\r\nare not so numerous. Several people who have settled here, eat their\r\nflesh, when they can shoot them. They are said to do no harm to corn,\r\nor the like.\r\n\r\nFebruary the 23d. This morning I went down to Penn’s Neck, and returned\r\nin the evening.\r\n\r\nSnow lay yet in several parts of the woods, especially where the trees\r\nstood very thick, and the sun could not make its way: however it was\r\nnot above four inches deep. All along the roads was ice, especially in\r\nthe woods, and therefore it was very difficult to ride horses, which\r\nwere not sharp shoed. The people who are settled here know little of\r\nsledges, but ride on horseback to church in winter, though the snow is\r\nsometimes near a foot deep. It lays seldom above a week before it\r\nmelts, and then some fresh snow falls.\r\n\r\nA species of birds, called by the Swedes, maize-thieves, do the\r\ngreatest mischief in this country. They have given them that name,\r\nbecause they eat maize, both publicly and secretly, just after it is\r\nsown and covered with the ground, and when it is ripe. The English call\r\nthem blackbirds. There are two species of them, both described and\r\ndrawn by Catesby [14]. Though they are very different in species, yet\r\nthere is so great a friendship between them, that they frequently\r\naccompany each other in mixed flocks. However, in Pensylvania, the\r\nfirst sort are more obvious, and often fly together, without any of the\r\nred-winged stares. The first sort, or the purple daws, bear, in many\r\npoints, so great a likeness to the daw, the stare, and the thrush, that\r\nit is difficult to determine to which genus they are to be reckoned,\r\nbut seem to come nearest to the stare; for the bill is exactly the same\r\nwith that of the thrush, but the tongue, the flight, their sitting on\r\nthe trees, their song and shape, make it entirely a stare; at a\r\ndistance they look almost black, but close by they have a very blue or\r\npurple cast, but not so much as Catesby’s print: their size is that of\r\na stare; the bill is conic, almost subulated, strait, convex, naked at\r\nthe base, black, with almost equal mandibles, the upper being only a\r\nvery little longer than the lower; the nostrils are oblong, yet a\r\nlittle angulated, so as to form almost squares; they are placed\r\nobliquely at the base of the bill, and have no hair; there is a little\r\nhorny knob, or a small prominence on the upper side of them; the tongue\r\nis sharp and bifid at the point; the iris of the eyes is pale; the\r\nforehead, the crown, the nucha, the upper part and the sides of the\r\nneck are of an obscure blue and green shining colour; the sides of the\r\nhead under the eyes are obscurely blue; all the back and coverts of the\r\nwings are purple; the upper coverts of the tail are not of so\r\nconspicuous a purple colour, but as it were blackened with soot; the\r\nnine primary quill-feathers are black; the other secundary ones are\r\nlikewise black, but their outward margin is purple; the twelve tail\r\nfeathers have a blackish purple colour, and their tips are round; those\r\non the outside are the shortest, and the middle extremely long. When\r\nthe tail is spread, it looks round towards the extremity. The throat is\r\nblueish green, and shining; the breast is likewise black or shining\r\ngreen, according as you turn it to the light; the belly is blackish,\r\nand the vent feathers are obscurely purple-coloured; the parts of the\r\nbreast and belly which are covered by the wings, are purple-coloured;\r\nthe wings are black below, or rather sooty; and the thighs have\r\nblackish feathers; the legs (tibiæ), and the toes are of a shining\r\nblack. It has four toes, as most birds have. The claws are black, and\r\nthat on the back toe is longer than the rest. Dr. Linnæus calls this\r\nbird Gracula Quiscula.\r\n\r\nA few of these birds are said to winter in swamps, which are quite\r\novergrown with thick woods; and they only appear in mild weather. But\r\nthe greatest number go to the south at the approach of winter. To-day I\r\nsaw them, for the first time this year. They flew in great flocks\r\nalready. Their chief and most agreeable food is maize. They come in\r\ngreat swarms in spring, soon after the maize is put under ground. They\r\nscratch up the grains of maize, and eat them. As soon as the leaf comes\r\nout, they take hold of it with their bills, and pluck it up, together\r\nwith the corn or grain; and thus they give a great deal of trouble to\r\nthe country people, even so early in spring. To lessen their greediness\r\nof maize, some people dip the grains of that plant in a decoct of the\r\nroot of the veratrum album, or white hellebore, (of which I shall speak\r\nin the sequel) and plant them afterwards. When the maize-thief eats a\r\ngrain or two, which are so prepared, his head is disordered, and he\r\nfalls down: this frightens his companions, and they dare not venture to\r\nthe place again. But they repay themselves amply towards autumn, when\r\nthe maize grows ripe; for at that time, they are continually feasting.\r\nThey assemble by thousands in the maize-fields, and live at discretion.\r\nThey are very bold; for when they are disturbed, they only go and\r\nsettle in another part of the field. In that manner, they always go\r\nfrom one end of the field to the other, and do not leave it till they\r\nare quite satisfied. They fly in incredible swarms in autumn; and it\r\ncan hardly be conceived whence such immense numbers of them should\r\ncome. When they rise in the air they darken the sky, and make it look\r\nquite black. They are then in such great numbers, and so close\r\ntogether, that it is surprising how they find room to move their wings.\r\nI have known a person shoot a great number of them on one side of a\r\nmaize-field, which was far from frightening the rest; for they only\r\njust took flight, and dropped at about the distance of a musket-shot in\r\nanother part of the field, and always changed their place when their\r\nenemy approached. They tired the sportsman, before he could drive them\r\nfrom off the maize, though he killed a great many of them at every\r\nshot. They likewise eat the seeds of the aquatic tare-grass (Zizania\r\naquatica) commonly late in autumn, after the maize is got in. I am\r\ntold, they likewise eat buck-wheat, and oats. Some people say, that\r\nthey even eat wheat, barley, and rye, when pressed by hunger; yet, from\r\nthe best information I could obtain, they have not been found to do any\r\ndamage to these species of corn. In spring, they sit in numbers on the\r\ntrees, near the farms; and their note is pretty agreeable. As they are\r\nso destructive to maize, the odium of the inhabitants against them is\r\ncarried so far, that the laws of Pensylvania and New Jersey have\r\nsettled a premium of three-pence a dozen for dead maize-thieves. In New\r\nEngland, the people are still greater enemies to them; for Dr. Franklin\r\ntold me, in the spring of the year 1750, that, by means of the premiums\r\nwhich have been settled for killing them in New England, they have been\r\nso extirpated, that they are very rarely seen, and in a few places\r\nonly. But as, in the summer of the year 1749, an immense quantity of\r\nworms appeared on the meadows, which devoured the grass, and did great\r\ndamage, the people have abated their enmity against the maize-thieves;\r\nfor they thought they had observed, that those birds lived chiefly on\r\nthese worms before the maize is ripe, and consequently extirpated them,\r\nor at least prevented their spreading too much. They seem therefore to\r\nbe entitled, as it were, to a reward for their trouble. But after these\r\nenemies and destroyers of the worms (the maize-thieves) were\r\nextirpated, the worms were more at liberty to multiply; and therefore\r\nthey grew so numerous, that they did more mischief now than the birds\r\ndid before. In the summer 1749, the worms left so little hay in New\r\nEngland, that the inhabitants were forced to get hay from Pensylvania,\r\nand even from Old England. The maize-thieves have enemies besides the\r\nhuman species. A species of little hawks live upon them, and upon other\r\nlittle birds. I saw some of these hawks driving up the maize-thieves,\r\nwhich were in the greatest security, and catching them in the air.\r\nNobody eats the flesh of the purple maize-thieves or daws (Gracula\r\nquiscula); but that of the red-winged maize-thieves, or stares (Oriolus\r\nPhœniceus) is sometimes eaten. Some old people have told me, that this\r\npart of America, formerly called New Sweden, still contained as many\r\nmaize-thieves as it did formerly. The cause of this they derive from\r\nthe maize, which is now sown in much greater quantity than formerly;\r\nand they think that the birds can get their food with more ease at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe American whortleberry, or the Vaccinium hispidulum, is extremely\r\nabundant over all North America, and grows in such places where we\r\ncommonly find our whortle-berries in Sweden. The American ones are\r\nbigger, but in most things so like the Swedish ones, that many people\r\nwould take them to be mere varieties. The English call them\r\nCranberries, the Swedes Tranbær, and the French in Canada Atopa, which\r\nis a name they have borrowed from the Indians. They are brought to\r\nmarket every Wednesday and Saturday at Philadelphia, late in autumn.\r\nThey are boiled and prepared in the same manner as we do our red\r\nwhortle-berries, or Vaccinium vitis idæa; and they are made use of\r\nduring winter, and part of summer, in tarts and other kinds of pastry.\r\nBut as they are very sour, they require a deal of sugar; but that is\r\nnot very dear, in a country where the sugar-plantations are not far\r\noff. Quantities of these berries are sent over, preserved, to Europe,\r\nand to the West Indies.\r\n\r\nMarch the 2d. Mytilus anatinus, a kind of muscle-shells, was found\r\nabundantly in little furrows, which crossed the meadows. The shells\r\nwere frequently covered on the outside, with a thin crust of particles\r\nof iron, when the water in the furrows came from an iron mine. The\r\nEnglishmen and Swedes settled here seldom made any use of these shells;\r\nbut the Indians who formerly lived here broiled them and ate the flesh.\r\nSome of the Europeans eat them sometimes.\r\n\r\nThe snow still remained in some parts of the wood, where it was very\r\nshady, but the fields were quite free from it. The cows, horses, sheep,\r\nand hogs, went into the woods, and sought their food, which was as yet\r\nvery trifling.\r\n\r\nMarch the 3d. The Swedes call a species of little birds, Snofogel, and\r\nthe English call it Snow-bird. This is Dr. Linnæus’s Emberiza hyemalis.\r\nThe reason why it is called snow-bird is because it never appears in\r\nsummer, but only in winter, when the fields are covered with snow. In\r\nsome winters they come in as great numbers as the maize-thieves, fly\r\nabout the houses and barns, into the gardens, and eat the corn, and the\r\nseeds of grass, which they find scattered on the hills.\r\n\r\nAt eight o’clock at night we observed a meteor, commonly called\r\nsnow-fire [15]. I have described this meteor in the memoirs of the\r\nRoyal Swedish Academy of Sciences, see the volume for the year 1752,\r\npage 154, 155.\r\n\r\nWild Pigeons, (Columba migratoria [16]), flew in the woods, in numbers\r\nbeyond conception, and I was assured that they were more plentiful than\r\nthey had been for several years past. They came this week, and\r\ncontinued here for about a fortnight, after which they all disappeared,\r\nor advanced further into the country, from whence they came. I shall\r\nspeak of them more particularly in another place.\r\n\r\nMarch the 7th. Several people told me, that it was a certain sign of\r\nbad weather here when a thunder-storm arose in the south or south west,\r\nif it spread to the east and afterwards to the north: but that on the\r\ncontrary, when it did not spread at all, or when it spread both east\r\nand west, though it should rise in south or south west, yet it would\r\nprognosticate fair weather. To-day it was heard in south west, but it\r\ndid not spread at all. See the meteorological observations, at the end\r\nof this volume.\r\n\r\nTill now the frost had continued in the ground, so that if any one had\r\na mind to dig a hole he was forced to cut it through with a pick-ax.\r\nHowever it had not penetrated above four inches deep. But to-day it was\r\nquite gone out. This made the soil so soft, that on riding, even in the\r\nwoods, the horse sunk in very deep.\r\n\r\nI often enquired among the old Englishmen and Swedes, whether they had\r\nfound that any trees were killed in very severe winters, or had\r\nreceived much hurt. I was answered, that young hiccory trees are\r\ncommonly killed in very cold weather; and the young black oaks likewise\r\nsuffer in the same manner. Nay sometimes black oaks, five inches in\r\ndiameter, were killed by the frost in a severe winter, and sometimes,\r\nthough very seldom, a single mulberry-tree was killed. Peach-trees very\r\nfrequently die in a cold winter, and often all the peach-trees in a\r\nwhole district are killed by a severe frost. It has been found\r\nrepeatedly, with regard to these trees, that they can stand the frost\r\nmuch better on hills, than in vallies; insomuch, that when the trees in\r\na valley were killed by frost, those on a hill were not hurt at all.\r\nThey assured me that they had never observed that the black\r\nwalnut-tree, the sassafras, and other trees, had been hurt in winter.\r\nIn regard to a frost in spring, they had observed at different times,\r\nthat a cold night or two happened often after the trees were furnished\r\nwith pretty large leaves, and that by this most of the leaves were\r\nkilled. But the leaves thus killed have always been supplied by fresh\r\nones. It is remarkable that in such cold nights the frost acts chiefly\r\nupon the more delicate trees, and in such a manner, that all the\r\nleaves, to the height of seven and even of ten feet from the ground,\r\nwere killed by the frost, and all the top remained unhurt. Several old\r\nSwedes and Englishmen assured me they had made this observation, and\r\nthe attentive engineer, Mr. Lewis Evans, has shewn it me among his\r\nnotes. Such a cold night happened here, in the year 1746, in the night\r\nbetween the 14th and 15th of June, new style, attended with the same\r\neffect, as appears from Mr. Evans’s observations. The trees which were\r\nthen in blossom, had lost both their leaves and their flowers in these\r\nparts which were nearest the ground; sometime after they got fresh\r\nleaves, but no new flowers. Further it is observable, that the cold\r\nnights which happen in spring and summer never do any hurt to high\r\ngrounds, damaging only the low and moist ones. They are likewise very\r\nperceptible in such places where limestone is to be met with, and\r\nthough all the other parts of the country be not visited by such cold\r\nnights in a summer, yet those where limestone lies have commonly one or\r\ntwo every summer. Frequently the places where the limestone lies are\r\nsituated on a high ground; but they suffer notwithstanding their\r\nsituation; whilst a little way off in a lower ground, where no\r\nlimestone is to be found, the effects of the cold nights are not felt.\r\nMr. Evans was the first who made this observation, and I have had\r\noccasion at different times to see the truth of it, on my travels, as I\r\nshall mention in the sequel. The young hiccory-trees have their leaves\r\nkilled sooner than other trees, in such a cold night, and the young\r\noaks next; this has been observed by other people, and I have found it\r\nto be true, in the years 1749 and 1750.\r\n\r\nMarch the 11th. Of the genus of Wood-peckers, we find here all those,\r\nwhich Catesby in his first volume of the Natural History of Carolina,\r\nhas drawn and described. I shall only enumerate them, and add one or\r\ntwo of their qualities; but their description at large I defer for\r\nanother occasion.\r\n\r\nPicus principalis, the King of the Wood-peckers, is found here, though\r\nvery seldom, and only at a certain season.\r\n\r\nPicus pileatus, the crested Wood-pecker; this I have already mentioned.\r\n\r\nPicus auratus, the gold-winged Wood-pecker: This species is plentiful\r\nhere, and the Swedes call it Hittock, and Piut; both these names have a\r\nrelation to its note; it is almost continually on the ground, and is\r\nnot observed to pick in the trees; it lives chiefly on insects, but\r\nsometimes becomes the prey of hawks; it is commonly very fat, and its\r\nflesh is very palatable. As it stays all the year, and cannot easily\r\nget insects in winter, it must doubtless eat some kinds of grass or\r\nplants in the fields. Its form, and some of its qualities, make it\r\nresemble a cuckow.\r\n\r\nPicus Carolinus, the Carolina Wood-pecker. It lives here likewise, and\r\nthe colour of its head is of a deeper and more shining red than Catesby\r\nhas represented it, vol. i. p. 19. t. 19.\r\n\r\nPicus villosus, the spotted, hairy, middle-sized Wood-pecker is\r\nabundant here; it destroys the apple-trees by pecking holes into them.\r\n\r\nPicus erythrocephalus, the red-headed Wood-pecker. This bird was\r\nfrequent in the country, and the Swedes called it merely Hackspick, or\r\nWood pecker. They give the same name to all the birds which I now\r\nenumerate, the gold-winged wood-pecker excepted. This species is\r\ndestructive to maize-fields and orchards, for it pecks through the ears\r\nof maize, and eats apples. In some years they are very numerous,\r\nespecially where sweet apples grow, which they eat so far, that nothing\r\nbut the mere peels remain. Some years ago there was a premium of two\r\npence per head, paid from the public funds, in order to extirpate this\r\npernicious bird, but this law has been repealed. They are likewise very\r\nfond of acorns. At the approach of winter they travel to the southward.\r\nBut when they stay in numbers in the woods, at the beginning of winter,\r\nthe people look upon it as a sign of a pretty mild winter.\r\n\r\nPicus varius, the lesser, spotted, yellow-bellied Wood-pecker. These\r\nbirds are much more numerous than many people wished; for this, as well\r\nas the preceding and succeeding species, are very hurtful to\r\napple-trees.\r\n\r\nPicus pubescens, or the least spotted Wood-pecker. This species abounds\r\nhere. Of all the wood-peckers it is the most dangerous to orchards,\r\nbecause it is the most daring. As soon as it has pecked a hole into the\r\ntree, it makes another close to the first, in a horizontal direction,\r\nproceeding till it has pecked a circle of holes round the tree.\r\nTherefore the apple-trees in the orchards here have several rings round\r\ntheir stems, which lie very close above each other, frequently only an\r\ninch distant from each other. Sometimes these wood-peckers peck the\r\nholes so close, that the tree dries up. This bird, as Catesby remarks,\r\nis so like the lesser spotted wood-pecker, in regard to its colour and\r\nother qualities, that they would be taken for the same bird, were not\r\nthe former (the Picus pubescens) a great deal less. They agree in the\r\nbad quality, which they both possess, of pecking holes into the\r\napple-trees.\r\n\r\nRana ocellata are a kind of frogs here, which the Swedes call,\r\nSill-hoppetosser, i. e. Herring-hoppers, and which now began to quack\r\nin the evening, and at night, in swamps, pools, and ponds. The name\r\nwhich the Swedes give them is derived from their beginning to make\r\ntheir noise in spring, at the same time when the people here go\r\ncatching what are called herrings, which however differ greatly from\r\nthe true European herrings. These frogs have a peculiar note, which is\r\nnot like that of our European frogs, but rather corresponds with the\r\nchirping of some large birds, and can nearly be expressed by picet.\r\nWith this noise they continued throughout a great part of spring,\r\nbeginning their noise soon after sun-setting, and finishing it just\r\nbefore sun-rising. The sound was sharp, but yet so loud that it could\r\nbe heard at a great distance. When they expected rain they cried much\r\nworse than commonly, and began in the middle of the day, or when it\r\ngrew cloudy, and the rain came usually six hours after. As it snowed on\r\nthe 16th of the next month, and blew very violently all day, there was\r\nnot the least sign of them at night, and during the whole time that it\r\nwas cold, and whilst the snow lay on the fields, the frost had so\r\nsilenced them, that we could not hear one; but as soon as the mild\r\nweather returned, they began their noise again. They were very\r\ntimorous, and it was difficult to catch them; for as soon as a person\r\napproached the place where they lived, they are quite silent, and none\r\nof them appeared. It seems that they hide themselves entirely under\r\nwater, except the tip of the snout, when they cry. For when I stepped\r\nto the pond where they were in, I could not observe a single one\r\nhopping into the water. I could not see any of them before I had\r\nemptied a whole pool, where they lodged in. Their colour is a dirty\r\ngreen, variegated with spots of brown. When they are touched they make\r\na noise and moan; they then sometimes assume a form, as if they had\r\nblown up the hind part of the back, so that it makes a high elevation;\r\nand then they do not stir, though touched. When they are put alive into\r\nspirits of wine, they die within a minute.\r\n\r\nMarch the 12th. The bird which the English and Swedes in this country\r\ncall Robin-red-breast [17], is found here all the year round. It is a\r\nvery different bird from that which in England bears the same name. It\r\nis Linnæus’s Turdus migratorius. It sings very melodiously, is not very\r\nshy, but hops on the ground, quite close to the houses.\r\n\r\nThe Hazels (Corylus avellana) were now opening their blossoms. They\r\nsucceeded best in a rich mould, and the Swedes reckoned it a sign of a\r\ngood soil where they found them growing.\r\n\r\nMarch the 13th. The alder (Betula Alnus) was just blossoming.\r\n\r\nThe Dracontium foetidum grew plentifully in the marshes and began to\r\nflower. Among the stinking plants, this is the most fœtid; its nauseous\r\nscent was so strong, that I could hardly examine the flower; and when I\r\nsmelled a little too long at it, my head ached. The Swedes call it\r\nByorn-blad (bear’s-leaf) or Byorn-retter (bear’s-root.) The English\r\ncall it Polecat-root, because its effluvia are as nauseous and fœtid,\r\nas those of the polecat, which I have mentioned before. The flowers are\r\npurple-coloured; when they are in full flower, the leaves begin to come\r\nout of the ground; in summer the cattle do not touch it. Dr. Colden\r\ntold me, that he had employed the root in all cases where the root of\r\nthe arum is made use of, especially against the scurvy, &c. The Swedish\r\nname it got, because the bears, when they leave their winter\r\nhabitations, are fond of it in spring: It is a common plant in all\r\nNorth America.\r\n\r\nThe Draba verna was abundant here, and now appeared in flower.\r\n\r\nThe Veratrum album was very common in the marshes, and in low places\r\nover all North America. The Swedes here call it Dack, Dackor or\r\nDackretter, that is puppet-root, because the children make puppets of\r\nits stalks and leaves. The English call it Itch-reed or Ellebore. It is\r\na poisonous plant, and therefore the cattle never touch it; however it\r\nsometimes happens that the cattle are deceived in the beginning of\r\nspring, when the pastures are bare, and eat of the fine broad green\r\nleaves of this plant, which come up very early; but such a meal\r\nfrequently proves fatal to them. Sheep and geese have likewise often\r\nbeen killed with it. By means of its root, the maize is preserved from\r\nthe greediness of voracious birds, in the following manner: The roots\r\nare boiled in water, into which the maize is put as soon as the water\r\nis quite cool; the maize must ly all night in it, and is then planted\r\nas usual. When the maize-thieves, crows, or other birds, pick up or\r\npluck out the grains of maize, their heads grow delirious, and they\r\nfall, which so frightens the rest that they never venture on the field\r\nagain; when those which have tasted the grains recover, they leave the\r\nfield, and are no more tempted to visit it again. By thus preparing\r\nmaize, one must be very careful that no other creatures touch it; for\r\nwhen ducks or fowls eat a grain or two of the maize which is thus\r\nsteeped, they become very sick; but if they swallow a considerable\r\nquantity they die. When the root is thrown away raw, no animal eats it;\r\nbut when it is put out boiled, its sweet taste tempts the beasts to eat\r\nit. Dogs have been seen to eat a little of it, and have been very sick\r\nafter it; however they have recovered after a vomit, for when animals\r\ncannot free themselves of it by this means, they often die. Some people\r\nboil the root, and wash the scorbutic parts with the water or decoct.\r\nThis is said to cause some pain, and even a plentiful discharge of\r\nurine, but it re-establishes the patient. When the children here are\r\nplagued with vermin, the women boil this root, put the comb into the\r\ndecoction, and comb the head with it, and this kills them most\r\neffectually.\r\n\r\nMarch the 17th. At the first arrival of the Swedes in this country, and\r\nlong after that time, it was filled with Indians. But as the Europeans\r\nproceeded to cultivate the land, the Indians sold their land, and went\r\nfurther into the country. But in reality few of the Indians really left\r\nthe country in this manner; most of them ended their days before,\r\neither by wars among themselves, or by the small-pox, a disease which\r\nthe Indians were unacquainted with before their commerce with the\r\nEuropeans, and which since that time has killed incredible numbers of\r\nthem. For though they can heal wounds and other external hurts, yet\r\nthey know not how to proceed with fevers, or in general with internal\r\ndiseases. One can imagine, how ill they would succeed with the cure of\r\nthe small-pox, when as soon as the pustules appeared, they leaped naked\r\ninto the cold water of the rivers, lakes, or fountains, and either\r\ndived over head into it, or poured it over their body in great\r\nabundance, in order to cool the heat of the fever. In the same manner\r\nthey carry their children, when they have the small-pox, into the water\r\nand duck them [18]. But brandy has killed most of the Indians. This\r\nliquor was likewise entirely unknown to them, before the Europeans came\r\nhither; but after they had tasted it, they could never get enough of\r\nit. A man can hardly have a greater desire of a thing, than the Indians\r\nhave of brandy. I have heard them say, that to die by drinking brandy,\r\nwas a desirable and an honourable death; and indeed ’tis no very\r\nuncommon thing to kill themselves by drinking this liquor to excess.\r\n\r\nThe food of these Indians was very different from that of the\r\ninhabitants of the other parts of the world. Wheat, rye, barley, oats,\r\nand rice-groats, were quite unknown in America. In the same manner it\r\nis with regard to the fruits and herbs which are eaten in the old\r\ncountries. The maize, some kinds of beans, and melons, made almost the\r\nwhole of the Indian agriculture and gardening; and dogs were the only\r\ndomestic animals in North America. But as their agriculture and their\r\ngardening were very trifling, and they could hardly live two months in\r\na year upon their produce, they were forced to apply to hunting and\r\nfishing, which at that time, and even at present, are their chief\r\nsubsistence, and to seek some of the wild plants and trees here. Some\r\nof the old Swedes were yet alive, who in their younger years had an\r\nintercourse with the Indians, and had seen the minutiæ of their\r\nœconomy. I was therefore desirous of knowing which of the spontaneous\r\nherbs they made use of for food at that time; and all the old men\r\nagreed that the following plants were what they chiefly consumed:\r\n\r\nHopniss or Hapniss was the Indian name of a wild plant, which they ate\r\nat that time. The Swedes still call it by that name, and it grows in\r\nthe meadows in a good soil. The roots resemble potatoes, and were\r\nboiled by the Indians, who eat them instead of bread. Some of the\r\nSwedes at that time likewise ate this root for want of bread. Some of\r\nthe English still eat them instead of potatoes. Mr. Bartram told me,\r\nthat the Indians who live farther in the country do not only eat these\r\nroots, which are equal in goodness to potatoes, but likewise take the\r\npease which ly in the pods of this plant, and prepare them like common\r\npease. Dr. Linnæus calls the plant Glycine Apios.\r\n\r\nKatniss is another Indian name of a plant, the root of which they were\r\nlikewise accustomed to eat, when they lived here. The Swedes still\r\npreserve this name. It grows in low, muddy and very wet ground. The\r\nroot is oblong, commonly an inch and an half long, and one inch and a\r\nquarter broad in the middle; but some of the roots have been as big as\r\na man’s fists. The Indians either boiled this root or roasted it in hot\r\nashes. Some of the Swedes likewise eat them with much appetite, at the\r\ntime when the Indians were so near the coast; but at present none of\r\nthem make any use of the roots. A man of ninety-one years of age,\r\ncalled Nils Gustafson, told me, that he had often eaten these roots\r\nwhen he was a boy, and that he liked them very well at that time. He\r\nadded that the Indians, especially their women, travelled to the\r\nislands, dug out the roots, and brought them home; and whilst they had\r\nthem, they desired no other food. They said that the hogs, which are\r\namazingly greedy of them, have made them very scarce. The cattle are\r\nvery fond of its leaves. I afterwards got fond of these roots roasted,\r\nand in my opinion they tasted well, though they were rather dry: The\r\ntaste was nearly the same with that of the potatoes. When the Indians\r\ncome down to the coast and see the turneps of the Europeans, they\r\nlikewise give them the name of katniss. Their katniss is an arrow-head\r\nor Sagittaria, and is only a variety of the Swedish arrow-head or\r\nSagittaria sagittifolia, for the plant above the ground is entirely the\r\nsame, but the root under ground is much greater in the American than in\r\nthe European. Mr. Osbeck in his voyage to China, vol. i. p. 334, of the\r\nEnglish edition, mentions, that the Chinese plant a Sagittaria, and eat\r\nits roots. This seems undoubtedly to be a variety of this katniss.\r\nFurther in the north of this part of America, I met with the other\r\nspecies of Sagittaria which we have in Sweden.\r\n\r\nTaw-ho and Taw-him was the Indian name of another plant, the root of\r\nwhich they eat. Some of them likewise call it Tuckah; but most of the\r\nSwedes still knew it by the name of Taw-ho. It grows in moist ground\r\nand swamps. Hogs are very greedy of the roots, and grow very fat by\r\nfeeding on them. Therefore, they often visit the places where these\r\nroots grow; and they are frequently seen rooting up the mud, and\r\nfalling with their whole body into the water, so that only a little of\r\nthe back part was out of the water. It is therefore very plain, that\r\nthese roots must have been extirpated in places which are frequented by\r\nhogs. The roots often grow to the thickness of a man’s thigh. When they\r\nare fresh, they have a pungent taste, and are reckoned a poison in that\r\nfresh taste. Nor did the Indians ever venture to eat them raw, but\r\nprepared them in the following manner: They gathered a great heap of\r\nthese roots, dug a great long hole, sometimes two or three fathoms and\r\nupwards in length, into which they put the roots, and covered them with\r\nthe earth that had been taken out of the hole; they made a great fire\r\nabove it, which burnt till they thought proper to remove it; and then\r\nthey dug up the roots, and consumed them with great avidity. These\r\nroots, when prepared in this manner, I am told, taste like potatoes.\r\nThe Indians never dry and preserve them; but always take them fresh out\r\nof the marshes, when they want them. This Taw-ho is the Arum\r\nVirginicum, or Virginian Wake-robin. It is remarkable, that the Arums,\r\nwith the plants next akin to them, are eaten by men in different parts\r\nof the world, though their roots, when raw, have a fiery pungent taste,\r\nand are almost poisonous in that state. How can men have learnt, that\r\nplants so extremely opposite to our nature were eatable; and that their\r\npoison, which burns on the tongue, can be conquered by fire. Thus the\r\nroot of the Calla palustris, which grows in the north of Europe, is\r\nsometimes used instead of bread on an exigency. The North American\r\nIndians consume this species of Arum. Those of South America, and of\r\nthe West Indies, eat other species of Arums. The Hottentots, at the\r\nCape of Good Hope, in Africa, prepare bread from a species of Arum or\r\nWake-robin, which is as burning and poisonous as the other species of\r\nthis plant. In the same manner, they employ the roots of some kinds of\r\nArum as a food, in Egypt and Asia. Probably, that severe but sometimes\r\nuseful mistress, necessity, has first taught men to find out a food,\r\nwhich the first taste would have rejected as useless. This Taw-ho seems\r\nto be the same with what the Indians in Carolina call Tuckahoo; and of\r\nwhich see Vol. I. p. 287.\r\n\r\nTaw-kee is another plant, so called by the Indians who eat it. Some of\r\nthem call it Taw-kim, and others Tackvim. The Swedes call it always by\r\nthe name of Taw-kee. The plant grows in marshes, near moist and low\r\ngrounds, and is very plentiful in North America. The cattle, hogs and\r\nstags, are very fond of the leaves in spring; for they are some of the\r\nearliest. The leaves are broad, like those of the Convallaria, or Lilly\r\nof the Valley, green on the upper side, and covered with very minute\r\nhair, so that they looked like a fine velvet. The Indians pluck the\r\nseeds, and keep them for eating. They cannot be eaten fresh or raw, but\r\nmust be dried. The Indians were forced to boil them repeatedly in\r\nwater, before they were fit for use; and then they ate them like pease.\r\nWhen the Swedes gave them butter or milk, they boiled or broiled the\r\nseeds in it. Sometimes they employ these seeds instead of bread; and\r\nthey taste like pease. Some of the Swedes likewise ate them; and the\r\nold men among them told me, they liked this food better than any of the\r\nother plants which the Indians formerly made use of. This Taw-kee was\r\nthe Orontium aquaticum.\r\n\r\nBilberries were likewise a very common dish among the Indians. They are\r\ncalled Huckleberries by the English here, and belong to several species\r\nof Vaccinium, which are all of them different from our Swedish\r\nBilberry-bush, though their berries, in regard to colour, shape, and\r\ntaste, are so similar to the Swedish bilberry, that they are\r\ndistinguished from each other with difficulty. The American ones grow\r\non shrubs, which are from two to four feet high; and there are some\r\nspecies which are above seven feet in height. The Indians formerly\r\nplucked them in abundance every year, dried them either in the\r\nsun-shine or by the fire-side, and afterwards prepared them for eating,\r\nin different manners, These huckleberries are still a dainty dish among\r\nthe Indians. On my travels through the country of the Iroquese, they\r\noffered me, whenever they designed to treat me well, fresh maize-bread,\r\nbaked in an oblong shape, mixed with dried Huckleberries, which lay as\r\nclose in it as the raisins in a plumb-pudding. I shall write more at\r\nlarge about it in the sequel. The Europeans are likewise used to\r\ncollect a quantity of these berries, to dry them in ovens, to bake them\r\nin tarts, and to employ them in several other ways. Some preserve them\r\nwith treacle. They are likewise eaten raw, either quite alone or with\r\nfresh milk.\r\n\r\nI shall, on the 27th of March, find occasion to mention another dish,\r\nwhich the Indians ate formerly, and still eat, on formal ceremonies.\r\n\r\nMarch the 18th. Almost during the whole of this spring, the weather and\r\nthe winds were always calm in the morning at sun-rising. At eight\r\no’clock the wind began to blow pretty hard, and continued so all day,\r\ntill sun-setting; when it ceased, and all the night was calm. This was\r\nthe regular course of the weather; but sometimes the winds raged,\r\nwithout intermission, for two or three days together. At noon it was\r\ncommonly most violent. But in the ordinary way, the wind decreased and\r\nincreased as follows: At six in the morning, a calm; at seven, a very\r\ngentle western breeze, which grew stronger at eight; at eleven it was\r\nmuch stronger; but at four in the afternoon, it is no stronger than it\r\nwas at eight o’clock in the morning; and thus it goes on decreasing\r\ntill it is quite a calm, just before sun-set. The winds this spring\r\nblew generally west, as appears from the observations at the end of\r\nthis volume.\r\n\r\nI was told, that it was a very certain prognostic of bad weather, that\r\nwhen you see clouds in the horizon in the south-west, about\r\nsun-setting, and when those clouds sink below the horizon, in an hour’s\r\ntime, it will rain the next day, though all the forenoon be fair and\r\nclear. But if some clouds be seen in the south-west, in the horizon, at\r\nsun-set, and they rise some time after, you may expect fair weather the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nMarch the 20th. An old Swede prognosticated a change in the weather,\r\nbecause it was calm to-day; for when there has been wind for some days\r\ntogether, and a calm follows, they say, rain or snow, or some other\r\nchange in the weather, will happen. I was likewise told, that some\r\npeople here were of that false opinion, that the weather commonly\r\nalters on Friday; so that, in case it had rained or blown hard all the\r\nweek, and a change was to happen, it would commonly fall on Friday. How\r\nfar the former prognostic has been true, appears from my own\r\nobservations of the weather, to which I refer.\r\n\r\nMarch the 21st. The red maple (Acer rubrum) and the American elm (Ulmus\r\nAmericana) began to flower at present; and some of the latter kind were\r\nalready in full blossom.\r\n\r\nMarch the 24th. I walked pretty far to-day, in order to see whether I\r\ncould find any plants in flower. But the cloudy weather, and the great\r\nrains which had lately fallen, had allowed little or nothing to grow\r\nup. The leaves now began to grow pretty green. The plants which I have\r\njust before mentioned, were now in full blossom.\r\n\r\nThe noble Liverwort, or Anemone hepatica, was now every where in\r\nflower. It was abundant; and the Swedes called it Blablomster, or\r\nBlue-flower. They did not know any use of it.\r\n\r\nNear all the corn-fields on which I walked to-day, I did not see a\r\nsingle ditch, though many of them wanted it. But the people generally\r\nfollowed the English way of making no ditches along the fields, without\r\nconsidering whether the corn-fields wanted them or not. The consequence\r\nwas, that the late rain had in many places washed away great pieces of\r\nthe grounds, sown with wheat and rye. There were no ridges left between\r\nthe fields, except a very narrow one near the fence, which was entirely\r\nover-grown with the Sumach, or Rhus glabra, and with black-berry\r\nbushes, so that there the cattle could find very little or no food. The\r\ncorn fields were broad-cast, or divided into pieces, which were near\r\nseventeen feet broad, and separated from each other only by means of\r\nfurrows. These pieces were uniform, and not elevated in the middle.\r\n\r\nMeloe majalis a species of oil-beetle, crept about on the hills.\r\n\r\nPapilio Antiopa, or willow butterfly, flew in the woods to-day, and was\r\nthe first butterfly which I saw this year.\r\n\r\nPapilio Euphrosyne, or the April butterfly, was one of the scarce\r\nspecies. The other American insect, which I described this day and the\r\nfollowing days, I shall mention on some other occasion. In the sequel I\r\nshall only mention those which were remarkable for some peculiar\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nThe hay-stacks were commonly made here after the Swedish manner, that\r\nis, in the shape of a thick and short cone, without any cover over it.\r\nWhen the people wanted any hay, they cut some of it loose, by a\r\npeculiar sort of a knife. However, many people, especially in the\r\nenvirons of Philadelphia, had hay-stacks with roofs which could be\r\nmoved up and down. Near the surface of the ground were some poles laid,\r\non which the hay was put, that the air may pass freely through it. I\r\nhave mentioned before, that the cattle have no stables in winter or\r\nsummer, but must go in the open air, during the whole year. However, in\r\nPhiladelphia, and in a few other places, I have seen that those people\r\nwho made use of the latter kind of hay-stacks, viz. that with moveable\r\nroofs, commonly had built them so, that the hay was put a fathom or two\r\nabove the ground, on a floor of boards, under which the cattle could\r\nstand in winter, when the weather was very bad. Under this floor of\r\nboards were partitions of boards on all the sides, which however stood\r\nfar enough from each other, to afford the air a free passage.\r\n\r\nMarch the 27th. In the morning I went in order to speak with the old\r\nSwede, Nils Gustafson, who was ninety-one years of age. I intended to\r\nget an account of the former state of New Sweden. The country which I\r\nnow passed through was the same with that which I had found in those\r\nparts of North America I had hitherto seen. It was diversified with a\r\nvariety of little hills and vallies: the former consisted of a very\r\npale brick-coloured earth, composed, for the greatest part, of a fine\r\nsand, mixed with some mould. I saw no mountains, and no stones, except\r\nsome little stones, not above the size of a pigeon’s or hen’s egg,\r\nlying on the hills, and commonly consisting of white quartz, which was\r\ngenerally smooth and polished on the outside. At the bottom, along the\r\nvallies, ran sometimes rivulets of crystalline water, the bottom of\r\nwhich was covered with such white pebbles as I have just described. Now\r\nand then I met with a swamp in the vallies. Sometimes there appeared,\r\nthough at considerable distances from each other, some farms,\r\nfrequently surrounded on all sides by corn-fields. Almost on every\r\ncorn-field there yet remained the stumps of trees, which had been cut\r\ndown; a proof that this country has not been long cultivated, being\r\novergrown with trees forty or fifty years ago. The farms did not ly\r\ntogether in villages, or so that several of them were near each other,\r\nin one place; but they were all separated from one another. Each\r\ncountryman lived by himself, had his own ground about his house,\r\nseparated from the property of his neighbour. The greatest part of the\r\nland, between these farms so distant from each other, was over-grown\r\nwith woods, confiding of tall trees. However, there was a fine space\r\nbetween the trees, so that one could ride on horseback without\r\ninconvenience in the woods, and even with a cart in most places; and\r\nthe ground was very plain and uniform at the same time. Here and there\r\nappeared some fallen trees, thrown down by the wind; some were torn up\r\nby the roots; others broken quite across the stem. In some parts of the\r\ncountry the trees were thick and tall, but in others I found large\r\ntracts covered with young trees, only twenty, thirty, or forty years\r\nold: these tracts, I am told, the Indians formerly had their little\r\nplantations in. I did not yet see any marks of the leaves coming out,\r\nand I did not meet with a flower in the woods: for the cold winds,\r\nwhich had blown for several days together successively, had hindered\r\nthis. The woods consisted chiefly of several species of oak, and of\r\nhiccory. The swamps were filled with red maple, which was all now in\r\nflower, and made these places look quite red at a distance.\r\n\r\nThe old Swede, whom I came to visit, seemed to be still pretty hearty\r\nand fresh, and could walk by the help of a stick; but he complained of\r\nhaving felt in these latter years, some pains in his back, and limbs,\r\nand that he could keep his feet warm in winter only by sitting near the\r\nfire. He said he could very well remember the state of this country, at\r\nthe time when the Dutch possessed it, and in what circumstances it was\r\nin before the arrival of the English. He added, that he had brought a\r\ngreat deal of timber to Philadelphia, at the time that it was built. He\r\nstill remembered to have seen a great forest on the spot where\r\nPhiladelphia now stands. The father of this old man had been one of the\r\nSwedes who were sent over from Sweden, in order to cultivate and\r\ninhabit this country. He returned me the following answers to the\r\nquestions I asked him.\r\n\r\nQuere, Whence did the Swedes, who first came hither, get their cattle?\r\nThe old man answered, that when he was a boy, his father and other\r\npeople had told him, that the Swedes brought their horses, cows, and\r\noxen, sheep, hogs, geese, and ducks, over with them. There were but few\r\nof a kind at first, but they multiplied greatly here afterwards. He\r\nsaid, that Maryland, New York, New England, and Virginia, had been\r\nsooner inhabited by Europeans than this part of the country; but he did\r\nnot know whether the Swedes ever got cattle of any kind, from any of\r\nthese provinces, except from New York. Whilst he was yet very young,\r\nthe Swedes, as well as he could remember, had already a sufficient\r\nstock of all these animals. The hogs had propagated so much at that\r\ntime, there being so great a plenty of food for them, that they ran\r\nabout wild in the woods, and that the people were obliged to shoot\r\nthem, when they intended to make use of them. The old man likewise\r\nrecollected, that horses ran wild in the woods, in some places; but he\r\ncould not tell whether any other kind of cattle turned wild. He thought\r\nthat the cattle grow as big at present as they did when he was a boy,\r\nsupposing they get as much food as they want. For in his younger years,\r\nfood for all kinds of cattle was so plentiful, and even so superfluous,\r\nthat the cattle were extremely well fed by it. A cow at that time gave\r\nmore milk, than three or four do at present; but she got more and\r\nbetter food at that time, than three or four get now; and, as the old\r\nman said, the scanty allowance of grass, which the cattle get in\r\nsummer, is really very pitiful. The causes of this scarcity of grass\r\nhave already been mentioned.\r\n\r\nQuere, Whence did the English in Pensylvania and New Jersey get their\r\ncattle? They bought them chiefly from the Swedes and Dutch, who lived\r\nhere; and a small number were brought over from Old England. The form\r\nof the cattle, and the unanimous accounts of the English here,\r\nconfirmed what the old man had said.\r\n\r\nQuere, Whence did the Swedes here settled get their several sorts of\r\ncorn, and likewise their fruit-trees and kitchen-herbs? The old man\r\ntold me that he had frequently heard, when he was young, that the\r\nSwedes had brought all kinds of corn, and fruits, and herbs, or seeds\r\nof them, with them. For, as far as he could recollect, the Swedes here\r\nwere plentifully provided with wheat, rye, barley, and oats. The\r\nSwedes, at that time, brewed all their beer of malt made of barley, and\r\nlikewise made good strong beer. They had already got distilling\r\nvessels, and made good brandy. Every one among them had not a\r\ndistilling vessel, but when they intended to distil, they lent their\r\napparatus to one another. At first they were forced to buy maize of the\r\nIndians, both for sowing and eating. But after continuing for some\r\nyears in this country, they extended their maize-plantations so much\r\nthat the Indians were obliged some time after to buy maize of the\r\nSwedes. The old man likewise assured me, that the Indians formerly, and\r\nabout the time of the first settling of the Swedes, were more\r\nindustrious and laborious in every branch of business, than they are\r\nnow. Whilst he was young, the Swedes had a great quantity of very good\r\nwhite cabbage. Winter cabbage, or Cale, which was left on the ground\r\nduring winter, was likewise abundant. They were likewise well provided\r\nwith turnips. In winter they kept them in holes under ground. But the\r\nold man did not like that method; for when they had lain too long in\r\nthese holes, in winter, they became spungy. He preferred that method of\r\nkeeping them which is now commonly adopted, and which consists in the\r\nfollowing particulars. After the turnips have been taken out of the\r\nground in autumn, and exposed to the air for a while, they are put in a\r\nheap upon the field, covered with straw at the top, and on the sides,\r\nand with earth over the straw. By this means they stand the winter very\r\nwell here, and do not become spungy. The Indians were very fond of\r\nturneps, and called them sometimes Hopniss, sometimes Katniss. The\r\nSwedes likewise cultivated carrots, in the old man’s younger years.\r\nAmong the fruit-trees were Apple-trees. They were not numerous, and\r\nonly some of the Swedes had little orchards of them, whilst others had\r\nnot a single tree. None of the Swedes made cyder, for it is come into\r\nuse but lately. The Swedes brewed strong beer and small beer, and it\r\nwas their common liquor. But at present there are very few who brew\r\nbeer, for they commonly prepare cyder. Cherry-trees were abundant when\r\nNils Gustafson was yet a boy. Peach-trees were at that time more\r\nnumerous than at present, and the Swedes brewed beer of the fruit. The\r\nold man could not tell from whence the Swedes first of all got the\r\npeach-trees.\r\n\r\nDuring the younger years of this old man the Indians were every where\r\nspread in the country; they lived among the Swedes, and were scattered\r\nevery where. The old man mentioned Swedes who had been killed by the\r\nIndians; and he mentioned two of his countrymen who had been scalped by\r\nthem. They stole children from the Swedes, and carried them off, and\r\nthey were never heard of again. Once they came and killed some Swedes,\r\nand took the upper part of their sculls with them; on that occasion\r\nthey scalped a little girl, and would have killed her, if they had not\r\nperceived a boat full of Swedes, making towards them, which obliged\r\nthem to fly; the girl was afterwards healed, but never got any hair on\r\nher head again; she was married, had many children, and lived to a\r\nconsiderable age. At another time, the Indians attempted to kill the\r\nmother of this old man, but she vigorously resisted them, and in the\r\nmean while a number of Swedes came up, who frightened the Indians, and\r\nmade them run away. Nobody could ever find out to what nation of\r\nIndians these owe their origin; for in general they lived very\r\npeaceably with the Swedes.\r\n\r\nThe Indians had their little plantations of maize in many places;\r\nbefore the Swedes came into this country, the Indians had no other than\r\ntheir hatchets made of stone; in order to make maize plantations they\r\ncut out the trees and prepared the ground in the manner I have before\r\nmentioned [19]. They planted but little maize, for they lived chiefly\r\nupon hunting; and throughout the greatest part of summer, their Hopniss\r\nor the roots of the Glycine Apios, their Katniss, or the roots of the\r\nSagittaria Sagittifolia, their Taw-ho or the roots of the Arum\r\nVirginicum, their Taw-kee or Orontium aquaticum, and whortle-berries,\r\nwere their chief food. They had no horses or other cattle which could\r\nbe subservient to them in their agriculture, and therefore did all the\r\nwork with their own hands. After they had reaped the maize, they kept\r\nit in holes under ground, during winter; they dug these holes seldom\r\ndeeper than a fathom, and often not so deep; at the bottom and on the\r\nsides they put broad pieces of bark. The Andropogon bicorne, a grass\r\nwhich grows in great plenty here, and which the English call Indian\r\nGrass, and the Swedes Wilskt Grass [20], supplies the want of bark; the\r\nears of maize are then thrown into the hole and covered to a\r\nconsiderable thickness with the same grass; and the whole is again\r\ncovered by a sufficient quantity of earth: the maize kept extremely\r\nwell in those holes, and each Indian had several such subterraneous\r\nstores, where his corn lay safe, though he travelled far from it. After\r\nthe Swedes had settled here and planted apple-trees and peach-trees,\r\nthe Indians, and especially their women, sometimes stole the fruit in\r\ngreat quantity; but when the Swedes caught them, they gave them a\r\nsevere drubbing, took the fruit from them, and often their clothes too.\r\nIn the same manner it happened sometimes that as the Swedes had a great\r\nencrease of hogs, and they ran about in the woods, the Indians killed\r\nsome of them privately and feasted upon them: but there were likewise\r\nsome Indians who bought hogs of the Swedes and fed them; they taught\r\nthem to run after them like dogs, and whenever they removed from one\r\nplace to another, their hogs always followed them. Some of those\r\nIndians got such numbers of these animals, that they afterwards gave\r\nthem to the Swedes for a mere trifle. When the Swedes arrived in\r\nAmerica, the Indians had no domestic animals, except a species of\r\nlittle dogs. The Indians were extremely fond of milk, and ate it with\r\npleasure when the Swedes gave it them. They likewise prepared a kind of\r\nliquor like milk in the following manner: they gathered a great number\r\nof hiccory nuts and walnuts from the black walnut-trees, dried and\r\ncrushed them; then they took out the kernels, pounded them so fine as\r\nflour, and mixed this flour with water, which took a milky hue from\r\nthem, and was as sweet as milk. They had tobacco-pipes of clay,\r\nmanufactured by themselves, at the time that the Swedes arrived here;\r\nthey did not always smoke true tobacco, but made use of another plant\r\ninstead of it, which was unknown to the old Swedes, but of which he\r\nassured me that it was not the common mullein, or Verbascum Thapsus,\r\nwhich is generally called Indian Tobacco here [21].\r\n\r\nAs to their religion, the old man thought it very trifling, and even\r\nbelieved that they had none at all; when they heard loud claps of\r\nthunder, they said that the evil spirit was angry; some of them said\r\nthat they believed in a God, who lives in heaven. The old Swede once\r\nwalked with an Indian, and they met with a red-spotted snake on the\r\nroad: the old man therefore went to seek a stick in order to kill the\r\nsnake; but the Indian begged he would not touch it, because he adored\r\nit: perhaps the Swede would not have killed it, but on hearing that it\r\nwas the Indian’s deity, he took a stick and killed it, in the presence\r\nof the Indian, saying: Because thou believest in it, I think myself\r\nobliged to kill it. Sometimes the Indians came into the Swedish\r\nchurches, looked at them, heard them, and went away again, after a\r\nwhile. One day as this old Swede was at church, and did not sing,\r\nbecause he had no Psalm-book by him, one of the Indians, who was well\r\nacquainted with him, tapped him on the shoulder, and said: Why dost\r\nthou not sing with the others, Tantanta! Tantanta! Tantanta? On another\r\noccasion, as a sermon was preached in the Swedish church, at Raccoon,\r\nan Indian came in, looked about him; and, after hearkening a while to\r\nthe preacher, he said: Here is a great deal of prattle and nonsense,\r\nbut neither brandy nor cyder; and went out again. For it is to be\r\nobserved, that when an Indian makes a speech to his companions, in\r\norder to encourage them to war, or to any thing else, they all drink\r\nimmoderately on those occasions.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the Swedes arrived, they bought land at a very\r\ninconsiderable price. For a piece of baize, or a pot full of brandy, or\r\nthe like, they could get a piece of ground, which at present would be\r\nworth more than four hundred pounds, Pensylvania currency. When they\r\nsold a piece of land, they commonly signed an agreement; and though\r\nthey could neither read nor write, yet they scribbled their marks, or\r\nsignatures, at the bottom of it. The father of old Nils Gustafson\r\nbought a piece of ground from the Indians in New Jersey. As soon as the\r\nagreement was drawn up, and the Indians should sign it, one of them,\r\nwhose name signified a beaver, drew a beaver, another of them drew a\r\nbow and arrow, and a third a mountain, instead of their names. Their\r\ncanoes they made of thick trees; which they hollowed out by fire, and\r\nmade them smooth again with their hatchets, as has been before\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThe following account the old man gave me, in answer to my questions\r\nwith regard to the weather and its changes: It was his opinion, that\r\nthe weather had always been pretty uniform ever since his childhood;\r\nthat there happen as great storms at present as formerly; that the\r\nsummers now are sometimes hotter, sometimes colder, than they were at\r\nthat time; that the winters were often as cold and as long as formerly;\r\nand that still there often falls as great a quantity of snow as in\r\nformer times. However, he thought that no cold winter came up to that\r\nwhich happened in the year 1697; and which is often mentioned in the\r\nalmanacks of this country; and I have mentioned it in the preceding\r\nvolume. For in that winter the river Delaware was so strongly covered\r\nwith ice, that the old man brought many waggons full of hay over it,\r\nnear Christina; and that it was passable in sledges even lower. No\r\ncattle, as far as he could recollect, were starved to death in cold\r\nwinters; except, in later years, such cattle as were lean, and had no\r\nstables to retire into. It commonly does not rain, neither more nor\r\nless, in summer than it did formerly; excepting that, during the last\r\nyears, the summers have been more dry. Nor could the old Swede find a\r\ndiminution of water in brooks, rivers, and swamps. He allowed, as a\r\nvery common and certain fact, that wherever you dig wells, you meet\r\nwith oyster-shells in the ground.\r\n\r\nThe old Gustafson was of opinion, that intermitting fevers were as\r\nfrequent and violent formerly as they are now; but that they seemed\r\nmore uncommon, because there were fewer people at that time here. When\r\nhe got this fever, he was not yet full grown. He got it in summer, and\r\nhad it till the ensuing spring, which is almost a year; but it did not\r\nhinder him from doing his work, either within or out of doors. Pleurisy\r\nlikewise attacked one or two of the Swedes formerly; but it was not\r\nnear so common as it is now. The people in general were very healthy at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, the old Swede’s eyes were so much weakened that he was\r\nforced to make use of a pair of spectacles. He then got a fever; which\r\nwas so violent, that it was feared he would not recover. However, he\r\nbecame quite well again, and at the same time got new strength in his\r\neyes; so that he has been able to read without spectacles since that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe houses which the Swedes built when they first settled here, were\r\nvery bad. The whole house consisted of one little room, the door of\r\nwhich was so low, that one was obliged to stoop in order to get in. As\r\nthey had brought no glass with them, they were obliged to be content\r\nwith little holes, before which a moveable board was fastened. They\r\nfound no moss, or at least none which could have been serviceable in\r\nstopping up holes or cracks in the walls. They were therefore forced to\r\nclose them, both without and within, with clay. The chimnies were made\r\nin a corner, either of grey sand, a stone, or (in places where no stone\r\nwas to be got) of mere clay, which they laid very thick in one corner\r\nof the house. The ovens for baking were likewise in the rooms. Formerly\r\nthe Swedes had proper stables for the cattle; but after the English\r\ncame hither, and made no peculiar buildings for their cattle, the\r\nSwedes likewise left off making stables.\r\n\r\nBefore the English came to settle here, the Swedes could not get as\r\nmany cloaths as they wanted; and were therefore obliged to make shift\r\nas well as they could. The men wore waistcoats and breeches of skins.\r\nHats were not in fashion; and they made little caps, provided with\r\nflaps before. They had worsted stockings. Their shoes were of their own\r\nmaking. Some of them had learnt to prepare leather, and to make common\r\nshoes, with heels; but those who were not shoemakers by profession,\r\ntook the length of their feet, and sewed the leather together\r\naccordingly; taking a piece for the sole, one for the hind-quarters,\r\nand one more for the upper-leather. At that time, they likewise sowed\r\nflax here, and wove linen cloth. Hemp was not to be got; and they made\r\nuse of flaxen ropes and fishing tackle. The women were dressed in\r\njackets and petticoats of skins. Their beds, excepting the sheets, were\r\nskins of several animals; such as bears, wolves, &c.\r\n\r\nTea, coffee, and chocolate, which are at present universally in use\r\nhere, were then [22] wholly unknown. Bread and butter, and other\r\nsubstantial food, was what they breakfasted upon; and the\r\nabove-mentioned superfluities have only been lately introduced,\r\naccording to the account of the old Swede. Sugar and treacle they had\r\nin abundance, as far as he could remember; and rum formerly bore a more\r\nmoderate price.\r\n\r\nFrom the accounts of this old Swede I concluded, that before the\r\nEnglish settled here, they followed wholly the customs of Old Sweden;\r\nbut after the English had been in the country for some time, the Swedes\r\nbegan gradually to follow their customs. When this Swede was but a boy,\r\nthere were two Swedish smiths here, who made hatchets, knives, and\r\nscythes, exactly like the Swedish ones, and made them sharper than they\r\ncan be got now. The hatchets now in use are in the English way, with a\r\nbroad edge; and their handles are very narrow, Almost all the Swedes\r\nmade use of baths; and they commonly bathed every Saturday. They\r\ncelebrated Christmas with several sorts of games, and with several\r\npeculiar dishes, as is usual in Sweden; all which is now, for the\r\ngreatest part, left off. In the younger years of this Swede, they made\r\na peculiar kind of carts here. They sawed thick pieces of liquid-amber\r\ntrees, and made use of two of them for the foremost wheels, and of two\r\nmore for the hindmost. With those carts they brought home their wood.\r\nTheir sledges were at that time made almost in the same manner as they\r\nare now, or about as broad again as the true Swedish ones. Timber and\r\ngreat beams of wood were carried upon a dray. They baked great loaves,\r\nsuch as they do now. They had never any biscuit, though the clergymen,\r\nwho came from Sweden, commonly got some baked.\r\n\r\nThe English on their arrival here bought large tracts of land of the\r\nSwedes, at a very inconsiderable price. The father of the old Swede\r\nsold an estate to the English, which at this time would be reckoned\r\nworth three hundred pounds, for which he got a cow, a sow, and a\r\nhundred gourds.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the decrease of birds, the number of them and fish, he\r\nwas wholly of that opinion which I have already mentioned [23]. This\r\nwas the account which the old man gave me of the former state of the\r\nSwedes in this country. I shall speak more particularly of it in the\r\nsequel.\r\n\r\nHurricanes are sometimes very violent here, and often tear up great\r\ntrees. They sometimes proceed as it were in peculiar tracts, or lines.\r\nIn some places, especially in the hurricane’s tract, all the trees are\r\nstruck down, and it looks as if the woods were cut down designedly; but\r\nclose to the tract the trees receive no hurt. Such is the place which\r\nwas shewn to me to-day. It is dangerous to go into the woods where the\r\nhurricanes blow; for the trees fall before one has time to guard\r\nhimself, or make the least provision for his security.\r\n\r\nThe Pensylvanian Asp was now in full blossom. But neither this tree,\r\nnor those near a-kin to it, shewed their leaves.\r\n\r\nAn old countryman asserted that he commonly sowed a bushel of rye, on\r\nan acre of ground, and got twenty bushels in return; but from a bushel\r\nof barley he got thirty bushels. However in that case the ground must\r\nbe well prepared. Wheat returns about as much as rye. The soil was a\r\nclay mixed with sand and mould.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I returned [24].\r\n\r\nMarch the 28th. I found a black beetle [25] (Scarabæus) with a\r\npentagonal oval Clypeus or shield, on the head a short blunt horn, and\r\na gibbous, or hump-backed Thorax, or Corselet. This beetle is one of\r\nthe bigger sort here. I found here and there holes on the hills, which\r\nwere so wide that I could put my finger into them. On digging them up I\r\nalways found these beetles lying at the bottom, about five inches under\r\nground. Sometimes there were short whitish worms, about as thick as\r\none’s finger, which lay with the beetles; and perhaps they were related\r\nto them. There were likewise other insects in such holes, as, a black\r\ncricket (Gryllus campestris)? spiders, earth-beetles (Carabi), and\r\nothers. This beetle had a scent exactly like the Trifolium melilotus\r\ncærulea, or the blue melilot. It was entirely covered with oblong pale\r\nticks (Acari). Its feet were as strong as those of the common\r\nDung-chaffer (Scarabæus stercorarius).\r\n\r\nApril the 4th. A Cicindela, or shining beetle, with a gold-green head,\r\nthorax, and feet, and a blue green abdomen or belly, flew every where\r\nabout the fields, and was hunting other insects. It is very common in\r\nNorth America, and seems to be a mere variety of the Cicindela\r\ncampestris.\r\n\r\nCimex lacustris, a kind of Water-bugs, hopped in numbers on the surface\r\nof waters which had a slow course.\r\n\r\nDytiscus piceus, or, the great Water-beetle, swam sometimes in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAbout sixty years ago, the greatest part of this country was covered\r\nwith tall and thick trees, and the swamps were full of water. But it\r\nhas undergone so great a change, as few other places have undergone, in\r\nso short a time. At present the forests are cut down in most places,\r\nthe swamps drained by ditches, the country cultivated, and changed into\r\ncorn-fields, meadows, and pastures. Therefore, it seems very reasonable\r\nto suppose, that so sudden a change has likewise had some effect upon\r\nthe weather. I was therefore desirous of hearing from the old Swedes,\r\nwho have lived the longest in this country, and have been inhabitants\r\nof this place during the whole time of the change mentioned, whether\r\nthe present state of the weather was in some particulars remarkably\r\ndifferent from that which they felt in their younger years? The\r\nfollowing is an account which they all unanimously gave me in answer to\r\nthis question.\r\n\r\nThe winter came sooner formerly than it does now. Mr. Isaac Norris, a\r\nwealthy merchant, who has a considerable share in the government of\r\nPensylvania, confirmed this by a particular account. His father, one of\r\nthe first English merchants in this country, observed, that in his\r\nyounger years, the river Delaware was commonly covered with ice, about\r\nthe middle of November, old style, so that the merchants were obliged\r\nto bring down their ships in great haste before that time, for fear of\r\ntheir being obliged to ly all winter. On the contrary, this river\r\nseldom freezes over at present, before the middle of December, old\r\nstile.\r\n\r\nIt snowed much more in winter, formerly, than it does now; but the\r\nweather in general was likewise more constant and uniform; and when the\r\ncold set in, it continued to the end of February, or till March, old\r\nstyle, when it commonly began to grow warm. At present, it is warm,\r\neven the very next day after a severe cold; and sometimes the weather\r\nchanges several times a day.\r\n\r\nMost of the old people here were of opinion, that spring came much\r\nlater at present, than formerly, and that it was now much colder in the\r\nlatter end of February, and the whole month of May, than when they were\r\nyoung. Formerly the fields were as green, and the air as warm, towards\r\nthe end of February, as it is now in March, or in the beginning of\r\nApril, old stile. The Swedes at that time made use of this phrase: Pask\r\nbitida, Pask sent, altid Gras, that is, we have always grass at Easter,\r\nwhether it be soon or late in the year. But perhaps we can account as\r\nfollows, for the opinion which the people here have, that vegetation\r\nappeared formerly more forward than it does now. Formerly the cattle\r\nwere not so numerous as now; however, the woods were full of grass and\r\nherbs, which, according to the testimony of all the old people here,\r\ngrew to the height of a man. At present a great part of the annual\r\ngrasses and plants have been entirely extirpated by the continual\r\ngrazing of numbers of cattle. These annual grasses were probably green\r\nvery early in spring, and (being extirpated) might lead the people to\r\nbelieve, that every thing came on sooner formerly, than it does at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIt used to rain more abundantly than it does now, during the harvest\r\nespecially, the rains fell in such plenty, that it was very difficult\r\nto bring home the hay and corn. Some of the last years had been\r\nextremely dry. However, a few people were of opinion that it rained as\r\nplentifully at present, as formerly.\r\n\r\nAll the people agreed, that the weather was not by far so inconstant,\r\nwhen they were young, as it is now. For at present it happens at all\r\ntimes of the year, that when a day has been warm, the next is very\r\ncold, and vice versa. It frequently happens that the weather alters\r\nseveral times in one day; so that when it has been a pretty warm\r\nmorning, the wind blows from N. W. about ten o’clock, and brings a cold\r\nair with it; yet a little after noon it may be warm again. My\r\nmeteorological observations sufficiently confirm the reality of these\r\nsudden changes of weather, which are said to cause in a great measure\r\nthe people to be more unhealthy at present, than they were formerly.\r\n\r\nI likewise found every body agree in asserting, that the winter,\r\nbetwixt the autumn of the year 1697, and the spring of the year 1698,\r\nwas the coldest and the severest which they had ever felt.\r\n\r\nApril the 6th. Sanguinaria Canadensis, which is here called Blood-root,\r\nbecause the root is great and red, and, when cut, looks like the root\r\nof red beet, and the Epigæa repens, which some call the creeping ground\r\nLaurel, were both beginning to flower. The former grew in a rich mould,\r\nthe other in a poorer soil.\r\n\r\nThe Laurus æstivalis, which some people call Spice-wood, likewise began\r\nto blossom about this time; its leaves were not yet broke out; it liked\r\na moist soil in the woods.\r\n\r\nApril the 9th. Apocynum Cannabinum was by the Swedes called Hemp of the\r\nIndians; [26] and grew plentifully in old corn-grounds, in woods, on\r\nhills, and in high glades. The Swedes have given it the name of Indian\r\nhemp, because the Indians formerly, and even now, apply it to the same\r\npurposes as the Europeans do hemp; for the stalk may be divided into\r\nfilaments, and is easily prepared. When the Indians were yet settled\r\namong the Swedes, in Pensylvania and New Jersey, they made ropes of\r\nthis Apocynum, which the Swedes bought, and employed them as bridles,\r\nand for nets. These ropes were stronger, and kept longer in water, than\r\nsuch as were made of common hemp. The Swedes commonly got fourteen\r\nyards of these ropes for one piece of bread. Many of the Europeans\r\nstill buy such ropes, because they last so well. The Indians likewise\r\nmake several other stuffs of their hemp. On my journey through the\r\ncountry of the Iroquese, I saw the women employed in manufacturing this\r\nhemp. They made use neither of spinning-wheels nor distaffs, but rolled\r\nthe filaments upon their bare thighs, and made thread and strings of\r\nthem, which they dyed red, yellow, black, &c. and afterwards worked\r\nthem into stuffs, with a great deal of ingenuity. The plant is\r\nperennial, which renders the annual planting of it altogether\r\nunnecessary. Out of the root and stalk of this plant, when it is fresh,\r\ncomes a white milky juice, which is somewhat poisonous. Sometimes the\r\nfishing tackle of the Indians consists entirely of this hemp. The\r\nEuropeans make no use of it, that I know of.\r\n\r\nFlax and Cat-tail, were names given to a plant which grows in bays,\r\nrivers, and in deep whirlpools, and which is known to botanists by the\r\nname of Typha latifolia. Its leaves are here twisted together, and\r\nformed into great oblong rings, which are put upon the horse’s neck,\r\nbetween the mane and the collar, in order to prevent the horse’s neck\r\nfrom being hurt by the collar. The bottoms of chairs were frequently\r\nmade of these leaves, twisted together. Formerly the Swedes employed\r\nthe wool or cotton which surrounds its seeds, and put it into their\r\nbeds, instead of feathers; but as it coalesces into lumps after the\r\nbeds have been used for some time, they have left off making use of\r\nthem. I omit the use of this plant in physic, it being the peculiar\r\nprovince of the physicians.\r\n\r\nA species of Leek [27], very like that which appears only in woods on\r\nhills in Sweden, grows at present on almost all corn-fields mixed with\r\nsand. The English here called it Garlick. On some fields it grew in\r\ngreat abundance. When the cattle grazed on such fields, and ate the\r\ngarlick, their milk, and the butter which was made of it, tasted so\r\nstrongly of it, that they were scarce eatable. Sometimes they sold\r\nbutter in the Philadelphia markets, which tasted so strongly of garlick\r\nthat it was entirely useless. On this account, they do not suffer\r\nmilking cows to graze on fields where garlick abounds: this they\r\nreserve for other species of cattle. When the cattle eat much of this\r\ngarlick in summer, their flesh has likewise such a strong flavour, that\r\nit is unfit for eating. This kind of garlick appears early in spring;\r\nand the horses always passed by it, without ever touching it.\r\n\r\nIt would take too much room in my Journal, and render it too prolix,\r\nwere I to mark down the time when every wild plant in this country was\r\nin blossom, when it got ripe seeds, what soil was peculiar to it,\r\nbesides other circumstances. Some of my readers would be but little\r\namused with such a botanical digression. I intend therefore to reserve\r\nall this for another work, which will give a particular account of all\r\nthe plants of North America; and I shall only mention such trees and\r\nplants here, which deserve to be made known for some peculiar quality.\r\n\r\nApril the 12th. This morning I went to Philadelphia and the places\r\nadjacent, in order to know whether there were more plants lately sprung\r\nup, than at Raccoon, and in New Jersey in general. The wet weather\r\nwhich had happened the preceding days, had made the roads very bad in\r\nlow and clayey places.\r\n\r\nThe leaves which dropt last autumn had covered the ground, in depth\r\nthree or four inches. As this seems to hinder the growth of the grass,\r\nit was customary to burn it in March or at the end of that month,\r\n(according to the old stile) in order to give the grass the liberty of\r\ngrowing up. I found several spots burnt in this manner to-day; but if\r\nit be useful one way, it does a great deal of damage in another; all\r\nthe young shoots of several trees were burnt with the dead leaves,\r\nwhich diminishes the woods considerably; and in such places where the\r\ndead leaves had been burnt for several years together, the old trees\r\nonly were left, which being cut down, there remains nothing but a great\r\nfield, without any wood. At the same time all sorts of trees and plants\r\nare consumed by the fire, or at least deprived of their power of\r\nbudding; a great number of the plants, and most of the grasses here,\r\nare annual; their seeds fall between the leaves, and by that means are\r\nburnt: This is another cause of universal complaint, that grass is much\r\nscarcer at present in the woods than it was formerly; a great number of\r\ndry and hollow trees are burnt at the same time, though they could\r\nserve as fewel in the houses, and by that means spare part of the\r\nforests. The upper mould likewise burns away in part by that means, not\r\nto mention several other inconveniences with which this burning of the\r\ndead leaves is attended. To this purpose the government of Pensylvania\r\nhave lately published an edict, which prohibits this burning;\r\nnevertheless every one did as he pleased, and this prohibition met with\r\na general censure.\r\n\r\nThere were vast numbers of Woodlice in the woods about this time; they\r\nare a very disagreeable insect, for as soon as a person sits down on an\r\nold stump of a tree, or on a tree which is cut down, or on the ground\r\nitself, a whole army of Woodlice creep upon his clothes, and insensibly\r\ncome upon the naked body. I have given a full account of their bad\r\nqualities, and of other circumstances relating to them, in the Memoirs\r\nof the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences. See the Volume for the year\r\n1754, page 19.\r\n\r\nI had a piece of petrified wood given me to-day, which was found deep\r\nin the ground at Raccoon. In this wood the fibres and inward rings\r\nappeared very plainly; it seemed to be a piece of hiccory; for it was\r\nas like it, in every respect, as if it had but just been cut from a\r\nhiccory-tree.\r\n\r\nI likewise got some shells to-day which the English commonly call\r\nClams, and whereof the Indians make their ornaments and money, which I\r\nshall take an opportunity of speaking of in the sequel. These Clams\r\nwere not fresh, but such as are every where found in New Jersey, on\r\ndigging deep into the ground; the live shells of this kind are only\r\nfound in salt water, and on the sea coasts. But these Clams were found\r\nat Raccoon, about eight or nine English miles from the river Delaware,\r\nand near a hundred from the nearest sea-shore.\r\n\r\nAt night I went to Mr Bartram’s seat.\r\n\r\nApril the 13th. I employed this day in several observations relative to\r\nBotany.\r\n\r\nTwo nests of wasps hung in a high maple-tree, over a brook. Their form\r\nwas wholly the same with that of our wasp-nests, but they exceeded them\r\nin size. Each nest was ten inches in diameter; in each nest were three\r\ncakes, above one another, of which the lowermost was the biggest, and\r\nthe two uppermost decreased in proportion: there were some eggs of\r\nwasps in them. The diameter of the lowest cake was about six inches,\r\nand one quarter, and that of the uppermost, three inches, and three\r\nquarters. The cells in which the eggs or the young ones were deposited\r\nwere hexagonal, and the colour of the nest grey. I was told, that the\r\nwasps make this kind of nests out of the grey splints, which stick to\r\nold pales and walls. A dark brown bee, with black antennæ, and two\r\nblack rings on the belly, and purple wings, flew about the trees, and\r\nmight perhaps be an inhabitant of these nests.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of wasps, which are larger than these, make their nests\r\nquite open. It consists merely of one cake, which has no covering, and\r\nis made of the boughs of trees. The cells are horizontal, and when the\r\neggs or the young larvæ ly in them, they have lids or coverings, that\r\nthe rain may not come into them. But whither the old wasps retreat\r\nduring storms, is a mystery to me, except they creep into the crevices\r\nof rocks. That side of the cake which is uppermost is covered with some\r\noily particles, so that the rain cannot penetrate. The cells are\r\nhexagonal, from five to seven lines deep, and two lines in diameter.\r\nMr. Bartram observed, that these nests are built of two sorts of\r\nmaterials, viz. the splints which are found upon old pales, or fences,\r\nand which the wind separates from them; for the wasps have often been\r\nobserved to sit on such old wood, and to gnaw away these splints; the\r\nsides and the lid or cover of the cells are made of an animal\r\nsubstance, or glutinous matter, thrown up by the wasps, or prepared in\r\ntheir mouths; for when this substance is thrown into the fire, it does\r\nnot burn, but is only singed, like hair or horn. But the bottom of the\r\nnest being put into the fire, burns like linen or half-rotten wood, and\r\nleaves a smell of burnt wood. The wasps, whose nests I have now\r\ndescribed, have three elevated black shining points on the forehead\r\n[28], and a pentagonal black spot on the thorax. Towards the end of\r\nautumn these wasps creep into the cavities of mountains, where they ly\r\ntorpid during winter. In spring, when the sun begins to operate, they\r\ncome out during day-time, but return towards night, when it grows cold.\r\nI saw them early in spring during sunshine, in and about some cavities\r\nin the mountains. I was told of another species of wasps, which make\r\ntheir nests under ground.\r\n\r\nGyrinus natator (Americanus), or the Whirl-beetles. These were found\r\ndancing in great numbers on the surface of the waters.\r\n\r\nApril the 14th. This morning I went down to Chester: in several places\r\non the road are saw-mills, but those which I saw to-day had no more\r\nthan one saw. I likewise perceived that the woods and forests of these\r\nparts had been very roughly treated. It is customary here, when they\r\nerect saw-mills, wind-mills, or iron works, to lead the water a good\r\nway lower, in case the ground near a fall in the river is not\r\nconvenient for building upon.\r\n\r\nApril the 16th. This morning I returned to Raccoon. This country has\r\nseveral kinds of swallows, viz. such as live in barns, in chimneys, and\r\nunder ground; there are likewise martens.\r\n\r\nThe Barn Swallows, or House Swallows are those with a furcated tail.\r\nThey are Linnæus’s Hirundo rustica. I found them in all the parts of\r\nNorth America which I travelled over. They correspond very nearly to\r\nthe European House Swallow in regard to their colour, however there\r\nseems to be a small difference in the note. I took no notice this year\r\nwhen they arrived: but the following year, 1750, I observed them for\r\nthe first time on the 10th of April (new style); the next day in the\r\nmorning, I saw great numbers of them sitting on posts and planks, and\r\nthey were as wet as if they had been just come out of the sea [29].\r\nThey build their nests in houses, and under the roofs on the outside; I\r\nlikewise found their nests built on mountains and rocks whose top\r\nprojected beyond the bottom; they build too under the corners of\r\nperpendicular rocks; and this shews where the Swallows made their\r\nnests, before the Europeans settled and built houses here; for it is\r\nwell known that the huts of the Indians could not serve the purpose of\r\nthe Swallows. A very creditable lady and her children told me the\r\nfollowing story, assuring me that they were eye-witnesses to it: A\r\ncouple of Swallows built their nest in the stable belonging to the\r\nlady; the female Swallow sat upon the nest, laid eggs in it, and was\r\nabout to brood them; some days after, the people saw the female still\r\nsitting on the eggs: but the male flying about the nest and sometimes\r\nsettling on a nail, was heard to utter a very plaintive note, which\r\nbetrayed his uneasiness: on a nearer examination the female was found\r\ndead in the nest, and the people flung her away. The male then went to\r\nsit upon the eggs, but after being about two hours on them, and\r\nthinking the business too troublesome for him, he went out, and\r\nreturned in the afternoon with another female, which sat upon the eggs,\r\nand afterwards fed the young ones, till they were able to provide for\r\nthemselves. The people differed here in their opinions about the abode\r\nof Swallows in winter: most of the Swedes thought that they lay at the\r\nbottom of the sea; some, with the English and the French in Canada,\r\nthought that they migrate to the southward in autumn, and return in\r\nspring. I have likewise been credibly informed in Albany, that they\r\nhave been found sleeping in deep holes and clefts of rocks, during\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nThe Chimney Swallows are the second species, and they derive their name\r\nfrom building their nests in chimneys, which are not made use of in\r\nsummer: sometimes when the fire is not very great, they do not mind the\r\nsmoke, and remain in the chimney. I did not see them this year till\r\nlate in May, but in the ensuing year, 1750, they arrived on the 3d of\r\nMay, for they appear much later than the other Swallows. It is\r\nremarkable that each feather in their tail ends in a stiff sharp point,\r\nlike the end of an awl; they apply the tail to the side of the wall in\r\nthe chimneys, hold themselves with their feet, and the stiff tail\r\nserves to keep them up: they make a great thundering noise all the day\r\nlong, by flying up and down in the chimneys; and as they build their\r\nnests in chimneys only; and it is well known that the Indians have not\r\nso much as a hearth made of masonry, much less a chimney, but make\r\ntheir fires on the ground in their huts, it is an obvious question,\r\nWhere did these Swallows build their nests before the Europeans came,\r\nand made houses with chimneys? It is probable that they formerly made\r\nthem in great hollow trees; This opinion was adopted by Mr. Bartram,\r\nand many others here, Catesby has described the Chimney Swallow and\r\nfigured it [30], and Dr. Linnæus calls it Hirundo Pelasgia.\r\n\r\nThe Ground Swallows or Sand Martins, (Linnæus’s Hirundo riparia) are to\r\nbe met with every where in America; they make their nests in the ground\r\non the steep shores of rivers and lakes.\r\n\r\nThe Purple Martins have likewise been described and drawn in their\r\nnatural colours by Catesby [31]. Dr. Linnæus likewise calls them\r\nHirundo purpurea. They are less common here than the former species; I\r\nhave seen in several places little houses made of boards, and fixed on\r\nthe outside of the walls, on purpose that these Martins may make their\r\nnests in them; for the people are very desirous of having them near\r\ntheir houses, because they both drive away hawks and crows as soon as\r\nthey see them, and alarm the poultry by their anxious note, of the\r\napproach of their enemies. The chickens are likewise used to run under\r\nshelter, as soon as they are warned by the Martins.\r\n\r\nApril the 17th. The Dirca palustris, or Mouse-wood, is a little shrub\r\nwhich grows on hills, towards swamps and marshes, and was now in full\r\nblossom. The English in Albany call it Leather-wood, because its bark\r\nis as tough as leather. The French in Canada call it Bois de Plomb, or\r\nLeaden-wood, because the wood itself is as soft and as tough as lead.\r\nThe bark of this shrub was made use of for ropes, baskets, &c. by the\r\nIndians, whilst they lived among the Swedes. And it is really very fit\r\nfor that purpose, on account of its remarkable strength and toughness,\r\nwhich is equal to that of the Lime-tree bark. The English and the Dutch\r\nin many parts of North America, and the French in Canada, employ this\r\nbark in all cases, where we make use of Lime-tree bark in Europe. The\r\ntree itself is very tough, and you cannot easily separate its branches\r\nwithout the help of a knife: some people employ the twigs for rods.\r\n\r\nApril the 20th. This day I found the Strawberries in flower, for the\r\nfirst time, this year: the fruit is commonly larger than that in\r\nSweden; but it seems to be less sweet and agreeable.\r\n\r\nThe annual harvest, I am told, is always of such a nature, that it\r\naffords plenty of bread for the inhabitants, though it turns out to\r\ngreater advantage in some years than it does in others. A venerable\r\nseptuagenary Swede, called Aoke Helm, assured me, that in his time no\r\nabsolutely barren crop had been met with, but that the people had\r\nalways had pretty plentiful crops. It is likewise to be observed, that\r\nthe people eat their bread of maize, rye, or wheat, quite pure and free\r\nfrom the inferior kinds of corn, and clear of husks, stalks, or other\r\nimpurities. Many aged Swedes and Englishmen confirmed this account, and\r\nsaid, that they could not remember any crop so bad as to make the\r\npeople suffer in the least, much less that any body was starved to\r\ndeath, whilst they here in America. Sometimes the price of corn rose\r\nhigher in one year than in another, on account of a great drought or\r\nbad weather, but still there was always corn sufficient for the\r\nconsumption of the inhabitants. Nor is it likely that any great famine\r\ncan happen in this country, unless it please God to afflict it with\r\nextraordinary punishments. The weather is well known, from more than\r\nsixty years experience. Here are no cold nights which hurt the germ.\r\nThe wet is of short continuance, and the drought is seldom or never of\r\nlong duration. But the chief thing is the great variety of corn. The\r\npeople sow the different kinds, at different times and seasons, and\r\nthough one crop turn out bad, yet another succeeds. The summer is so\r\nlong, that of some species of corn they may get three crops. There is\r\nhardly a month from May to October or November, inclusive, in which the\r\npeople do not reap some kind of corn, or gather some sort of fruit. It\r\nwould indeed be a very great misfortune if a bad crop should happen;\r\nfor here, as in many other places, they lay up no stores, and are\r\ncontented that there is plenty of food for the present exigencies.\r\n\r\nThe Peach-trees were now every where in blossom; their leaves were not\r\nyet come out of the buds, and therefore the flowers shewed to greater\r\nadvantage; their beautiful pale red colour had a very fine effect; and\r\nthey sat so close that the branches were entirely clad with them. The\r\nother fruit-trees were not yet in flower; however the apple-blossoms\r\nbegan to appear.\r\n\r\nThe English and the Swedes of America give the name of Currants [32] to\r\na shrub which grows in wet ground, and near swamps, and which was now\r\nin blossom; its flowers are white, have a very agreeable fragrancy, and\r\ngrow in oblong bunches; the fruit is very good eating, when it is ripe;\r\nthe Style (Stylus) is thread-shaped (filiformis), and shorter than the\r\nStamina; it is divided in the middle, into five parts, or Stigmata. Dr.\r\nLinnæus calls it Cratægus [33], and Dr. Gronovius calls it a Mespilus\r\n[34].\r\n\r\nApril the 22d. The Swedes give the name of Whipperiwill, and the\r\nEnglish that of Whip-poor-will, to a kind of nocturnal bird, whose\r\nvoice is heard in North America, almost throughout the whole night.\r\nCatesby and Edwards both have described and figured it [35]. Dr.\r\nLinnæus calls it a variety of the Caprimulgus Europæus, or Goat-sucker:\r\nits shape, colour, size, and other qualities, make it difficult to\r\ndistinguish them from each other. But the peculiar note of the American\r\none distinguishes it from the European one, and from all other birds:\r\nit is not found here during winter, but returns with the beginning of\r\nsummer. I heard it to-day, for the first time, and many other people\r\nsaid, that they had not heard it before this summer; its English and\r\nSwedish name is taken from its note; but, accurately speaking, it does\r\nnot call Whipperiwill, nor Whip-poor-will, but rather Whipperiwhip so\r\nthat the first and last syllables are accented, and the intermediate\r\nones but slightly pronounced. The English change the call of this bird\r\ninto Whip-poor-will, that it may have some kind of signification: it is\r\nneither heard nor seen in day-time; but soon after sun-set it begins to\r\ncall, and continues for a good while, as the cuckow does in Europe.\r\nAfter it has continued calling in a place for some time, it removes to\r\nanother, and begins again: it commonly comes several times in a night,\r\nand settles close to the houses; I have seen it coming late in the\r\nevening, and settling on the steps of the house, in order to sing its\r\nsong; it is very shy, and when a person stood still, it would settle\r\nclose by him, and begin to call. It came to the houses in order to get\r\nits food, which consists of insects; and those always abound near the\r\nhouses at night; when it sat and called its whipperiwhip, and saw an\r\ninsect passing, it flew up and caught it, and settled again. Sometimes\r\nyou hear four or five, or more, near each other, calling as it were for\r\na wager, and raising a great noise in the woods. They were seldom heard\r\nin towns, being either extirpated there, or frightened away, by\r\nfrequent shooting. They do not like to sit on trees, but are commonly\r\non the ground, or very low in bushes, or on the lower poles of the\r\nenclosures. They always fly near the ground: they continue their\r\ncalling at night till it grows quite dark; they are silent till the\r\ndawn of day comes on, and then they call till the sun rises. The sun\r\nseems to stop their mouths, or dazzle their eyes, so as to make them\r\nsit still. I have never heard them call in the midst of night, though I\r\nhearkened very attentively, on purpose to hear it; and many others have\r\ndone the same. I am told they make no nest, but lay two eggs in the\r\nopen fields. My servant shot at one which sat on a bush near the house,\r\nand though he did not hit it, yet it fell down through fear, and lay\r\nfor some time quite dead; but recovered afterwards. It never attempted\r\nto bite when it was held in the hands, only endeavouring to get loose\r\nby stirring itself about. Above, and close under the eyes, were several\r\nblack, long, and stiff bristles, as in other nocturnal birds. The\r\nEuropeans eat it. Mr. Catesby says, the Indians affirm, that they never\r\nsaw these birds, or heard of them, before a certain great battle, in\r\nwhich the Europeans killed a great number of Indians. Therefore, they\r\nsuppose that these birds, which are restless, and utter their plaintive\r\nnote at night, are the souls of their ancestors who died in battle.\r\n\r\nApril the 24th. To-day the Cherry-trees began to shew their blossom;\r\nthey had already pretty large leaves.\r\n\r\nThe Apple-trees likewise began to blossom; however the Cherry-trees\r\nwere more forward: They likewise got a greenish hue from their leaves.\r\n\r\nThe Mulberry-trees [36] were yet quite naked; and I was sorry to find\r\nthat this tree is one of the latest in getting leaves, and one of the\r\nfirst which gets fruit.\r\n\r\nApril the 26th. This morning I travelled to Penn’s Neck. The\r\nTulip-trees, especially the tall ones, looked quite green, being\r\ncovered with their leaves; this tree is therefore one of the earliest\r\nwhich get leaves.\r\n\r\nTo-day I saw the flowers of the Sassafras-tree, (Laurus Sassafras). The\r\nleaves were not yet come out. The flowers have a fine smell.\r\n\r\nThe Lupinus perennis is abundant in the woods, and grows equally in\r\ngood soil and in poor. I often found it thriving on very poor sandy\r\nfields, and on heaths, where no other plants will grow. Its flowers,\r\nwhich commonly appear in the middle of May, make a fine shew by their\r\npurple hue. I was told, that the cattle eat these flowers very\r\ngreedily; but I was sorry to find very often that they were not so fond\r\nof it, as it is represented, especially when they had any thing else to\r\neat; and they seldom touched it notwithstanding its fine green colour,\r\nand its softness: The horses eat the flowers, but leave the stalks and\r\nleaves. If the cattle eat this plant in spring, necessity and hunger\r\ngive it a relish. This country does not afford any green pastures like\r\nthe Swedish ones; the woods are the places where the cattle must\r\ncollect their food. The ground in the woods is chiefly flat, or with\r\nvery little risings. The trees stand far asunder; but the ground\r\nbetween them is not covered with green sods; for there are but few\r\nkinds of grasses in the woods, and they stand single and scattered. The\r\nsoil is very loose, partly owing to the dead leaves which cover the\r\nground during a great part of the year. Thus the cattle find very\r\nlittle grass in the woods, and are forced to be satisfied with all\r\nkinds of plants which come in their way, whether they be good or bad\r\nfood. I saw for some time this spring, that the cattle bit off the tops\r\nand shoots of young trees, and fed upon them; for no plants were yet\r\ncome up, and they stand in general but very thin, and scattered here\r\nand there, as I have just mentioned. Hence you may easily imagine that\r\nhunger compels the cattle to eat plants, which they would not touch,\r\nwere they better provided for. However, I am of opinion, that it would\r\nbe worth while to make use of this Lupine to mend dry sandy heaths,\r\nand, I believe, it would not be absolutely impossible to find out the\r\nmeans of making it agreeable to the cattle.\r\n\r\nThe Oaks here have similar qualities with the European ones. They keep\r\ntheir dead leaves almost during the whole winter, and are very backward\r\nin getting fresh ones; they had no leaves as yet, and were but just\r\nbeginning to shew a few.\r\n\r\nThe Humming-bird, which the Swedes call Kings-bird [37], and which I\r\nhave mentioned in a former volume, appeared hereabouts to-day, for the\r\nfirst time this spring.\r\n\r\nNumbers of Oil beetles, (Meloë Proscarabœus) sat on the leaves of white\r\nHellebore, (Veratrum album) and feasted on them. I considered them a\r\ngreat while, and they devoured a leaf in a few minutes. Some of them\r\nhad already eaten so much that they could hardly creep. Thus this\r\nplant, which is almost certain death to other animals, is their dainty\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nThe fire-flies appeared at night, for the first time this year, and\r\nflew about between the trees, in the woods. It seemed, in the dark, as\r\nif sparks of fire flew up and down. I will give a more particular\r\naccount of them in another place.\r\n\r\nTowards night I went to Raccoon.\r\n\r\nMay the 1st. The last night was so cold that the ground at sun-rising\r\nwas as white as snow, from the hoary frost. The Swedish thermometer was\r\na degree and a half below the freezing point. We observed no ice in the\r\nrivers or waters of any depth; but upon such only as were about three\r\ninches deep, the ice lay to the thickness of one third part of a line\r\n[38]. The evening before, the wind was south, but the night was calm.\r\nThe apple-trees and cherry-trees were in full blossom. The peach-trees\r\nwere almost out of flower. Most of the forest-trees had already got new\r\nand tender leaves, and most of them were in flower, as almost all kinds\r\nof oaks, the dog-wood, (Cornus Florida), hiccory, wild prunes,\r\nsassafras, horn-beam, beeches, &c.\r\n\r\nThe plants which were found damaged by the frost, were the following.\r\n1. The Hiccory. Most of the young trees of this kind had their leaves\r\nkilled by the frost, so that they looked quite black in the afternoon;\r\nthe leaves were consumed by frost every where in the fields, near the\r\nmarshes, and in the woods. 2. The black Oak. Several of these trees had\r\ntheir leaves damaged by the frost. 3. The white Oak. Some very young\r\ntrees of this kind had lost their leaves by the frost. 4. The blossoms\r\nof the Cherry-trees were hurt in several places. 5. The flowers of the\r\nEnglish Walnut-tree were entirely spoiled by the frost. 6. The Rhus\r\nglabra. Some of these trees had already got leaves, and they were\r\nkilled by the cold. 7. The Rhus radicans; the tender young trees of\r\nthis kind suffered from the frost, and had their leaves partly killed.\r\n8. The Thalictra, or Meadow Rues, had both their flowers and leaves\r\nhurt by the frost. 9. The Podophyllum peltatum. Of this plant there was\r\nnot above one in five hundred hurt by the frost. 10. The Ferns. A\r\nnumber of them, which were lately come up, were destroyed. I must add\r\nseveral plants which were likewise hurt, but which I could not\r\ndistinguish, on account of their smallness.\r\n\r\nI went to several places this day.\r\n\r\nThe Bartsia coccinea grew in great abundance on several low meadows.\r\nIts flower-buds were already tinged with their precious scarlet, and\r\nadorned the meadows. It is not yet applied to any use, but that of\r\ndelighting the sight.\r\n\r\nOne of the Swedes here had planted an English walnut-tree (Juglans\r\nregia) in his garden, and it was now about three yards high; it was in\r\nfull blossom, and had already great leaves, whereas the black\r\nwalnut-trees, which grow spontaneously in every part of this country,\r\nhad not yet any leaves, or flowers. The last night’s frost had killed\r\nall the leaves of the European kind. Dr. Franklin told me afterwards,\r\nthat there had been some English walnut-trees in Philadelphia, which\r\ncame on very well; but that they were killed by the frost.\r\n\r\nI looked about me for the trees which had not yet got fresh leaves, and\r\nI found the following ones:\r\n\r\nJuglans nigra, or the Black Walnut-tree.\r\n\r\nFraxinus excelsior, or the Ash.\r\n\r\nAcer Negundo, called the White-ash here.\r\n\r\nNyssa aquatica, the Tupelo-tree.\r\n\r\nDiospyros Virginiana, or the Persimon.\r\n\r\nVitis Labrusca, or the Fox-grapes; and\r\n\r\nRhus glabra, or the Sumach.\r\n\r\nThe trees whose leaves were coming out, were the following:\r\n\r\nMorus rubra, the Mulberry-tree.\r\n\r\nFagus Castanea, the Chesnut-tree.\r\n\r\nPlatanus occidentalis, or the Water-beach.\r\n\r\nLaurus Sassafras, the Sassafras-tree.\r\n\r\nJuglans alba, the Hiccory. Some trees of this kind had already large\r\nleaves, but others had none at all; the same difference, I believe,\r\nexists likewise among the other species of hiccory.\r\n\r\nThe Virginian Cherry-tree grows here and there, in the woods and\r\nglades: its leaves were already pretty large; but the flowers were not\r\nyet entirely open.\r\n\r\nThe Sassafras-tree was now every where in flower; but its leaves were\r\nnot yet quite disclosed.\r\n\r\nThe Liquidambar Styraciflua or Sweet Gum-tree, grows in the woods,\r\nespecially in wet soil, in and near purling rivulets: its leaves were\r\nnow already sprouting out at its summit. This tree grows to a great\r\nthickness, and its height rivals that of the tallest firs and oaks; as\r\nit grows higher, the lower branches die and drop, and leave the stem at\r\nlast quite smooth and strait, with a great crown at the very summit;\r\nthe seeds are contained in round, dentated cones, which drop in autumn;\r\nand as the tree is very tall, so the high winds carry the seeds away to\r\na great distance. I have already given an account of the use of this\r\ntree in the first volume, to which I must add the following account.\r\n\r\nThe wood can be made very smooth, because its veins are extremely fine:\r\nbut it is not hard; you can carve letters on it with a knife, which\r\nwill seem to be engraved. Mr. Lewis Evans told me, from his own\r\nexperience, that no wood in this country was more fit for making moulds\r\nfor casting brass in, than this. I enquired of Mr. Bartram, “Whether he\r\nhad found the rosin on this tree, which is so much praised in physic.”\r\nHe told me, “That a very odoriferous rosin always flows out of any cut\r\nor wound, which is made in the tree; but that the quantity here was too\r\ninconsiderable to recompense the labour of collecting it.” This\r\nodoriferous rosin or gum first gave rise to the English name. The\r\nfurther you go to the South, the greater quantity of gum does the tree\r\nyield, so that it is easy to collect it. Mr. Bartram was of opinion,\r\nthat this tree was properly calculated for the climate of Carolina, and\r\nthat it was brought by several ways so far North as New York. In the\r\nsouthern countries the heat of the Sun fills the tree with gum, but in\r\nthe northern ones it does not.\r\n\r\nMay the 2d. This morning I travelled down to Salem, in order to see the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe Sassafras-tree stood single in the woods, and along the fences,\r\nround the fields: it was now distinguishable at a distance for its fine\r\nflowers, which being now quite open, made it look quite yellow. The\r\nleaves were not yet come out.\r\n\r\nIn some meadows the grass was already grown up pretty high: but it is\r\nto be observed, that these meadows were marshy, and that no cattle had\r\nbeen on them this year. These meadows are mown twice a year, viz. in\r\nMay, and the end of August, or beginning of August, old style. I saw\r\nsome meadows of this kind to-day, in which I saw grass which was now\r\nalmost fit to be mown; and many meadows in Sweden have not such grass\r\nat the proper time of mowing, as these had now; these meadows lay in\r\nmarshes and vallies, where the Sun had very great power: the grass\r\nconsisted merely of Cyperus-grass or Carex.\r\n\r\nThe wild Prune-trees were now every where in flower; they grow here and\r\nthere in the woods, but commonly near marshes and in wet ground; they\r\nare distinguishable by their white flowers: the fruit when ripe is\r\neatable.\r\n\r\nThe Cornus Florida, or Dogwood, grows in the forests, on hills, on\r\nplains, in vallies, in marshes, and near rivulets. I cannot therefore\r\nsay, which is its native soil; however, it seems that in a low but not\r\na wet soil it succeeds best; it was now adorned with its great snowy\r\nInvolucra, which render it conspicuous even at a distance. At this time\r\nit is a pleasure to travel through the woods, so much are they\r\nbeautified by the blossoms of this tree. The flowers which are within\r\nthe Involucra began to open to-day. The tree does not grow to any\r\nconsiderable height or thickness, but is about the size of our Mountain\r\nAsh (Sorbus aucuparia). There are three species of this tree in the\r\nwoods; one with great white Involucra, another with small white ones,\r\nand a third with reddish ones.\r\n\r\nThe woods were now full of birds: I saw the lesser species every where\r\nhopping on the ground, or creeping in bushes, without any great degree\r\nof shiness; it is therefore very easy for all kinds of snakes to\r\napproach and bite them. I believe that the rattlesnake has nothing to\r\ndo but to ly still, and without waiting long, some little bird or other\r\nwill pass by or run directly upon her, giving her an opportunity of\r\ncatching it, without any enchantment.\r\n\r\nSalem is a little trading town, situated at some distance from the\r\nriver Delaware. The houses do not stand far asunder, and are partly\r\nstone, and partly wood. A rivulet passes by the town, and falls into\r\nthe Delaware. The inhabitants live by their several trades, as well as\r\nthey can. In the neighbourhood of Salem are some very low and swampy\r\nmeadows; and therefore it is reckoned a very unwholesome place.\r\nExperience has shewn, that those who came hither from other places to\r\nsettle, got a very pale and sickly look, though they arrived in perfect\r\nhealth, and with a very lively colour. The town is very easily\r\ndistinguished about this time, by the disagreeable stench which arises\r\nfrom the swamps. The vapours of the putrid water are carried to those\r\ninhabitants which live next to the marshes; and enter the body along\r\nwith the air, and through the pores, and thus are hurtful to health. At\r\nthe end of every summer, the intermitting fevers are very frequent. I\r\nknew a young couple, who came along with me from England to America:\r\nsoon after their arrival at Philadelphia, they went to Salem, in\r\nperfect health; but a few weeks after they fell sick, and before the\r\nwinter was half over they were both dead.\r\n\r\nMany of the inhabitants plant Saffron; but it is not so good and so\r\nstrong as the English and French Saffron. Perhaps it grows better by\r\nbeing laid up for some years, as tobacco does.\r\n\r\nThe Gossypium herbaceum, or Cotton plant, is an annual plant; and\r\nseveral of the inhabitants of Salem had began to sow it. Some had the\r\nseeds from Carolina, where they have great plantations of cotton; but\r\nothers got it out of some cotton which they had bought. They said, it\r\nwas difficult, at first, to get ripe seeds from the plants which were\r\nsown here; for the summer in Carolina, from whence their first seed\r\ncame, is both longer and hotter than it is here. But after the plants\r\nhave been more used to the climate, and hastened more than they were\r\nformerly, the seeds are ripe in due time.\r\n\r\nAt night I returned to Raccoon.\r\n\r\nMay the 4th. Crab-trees are a species of wild apple trees, which grow\r\nin the woods and glades, but especially on little hillocks, near rivers\r\n[39]. In New Jersey the tree is rather scarce; but in Pensylvania it is\r\nplentiful. Some people had planted a single tree of this kind near\r\ntheir farms, on account of the fine smells which its flowers afford. It\r\nhad begun to open some of its flowers about a day or two ago; however,\r\nmost of them were not yet open. They are exactly like the blossoms of\r\nthe common apple-trees, except that the colour is a little more reddish\r\nin the Crab-trees; though some kinds of the cultivated trees have\r\nflowers which are very near as red: but the smell distinguishes them\r\nplainly; for the wild trees have a very pleasant smell, somewhat like\r\nthe rasp-berry. The apples, or crabs, are small, sour, and unfit for\r\nany thing but to make vinegar of. They ly under the trees all the\r\nwinter, and acquire a yellow colour. They seldom begin to rot before\r\nspring comes on.\r\n\r\nI cannot omit an observation here. The Crab-trees opened their flowers\r\nonly yesterday and to-day; whereas, the cultivated apple-trees, which\r\nare brought from Europe, had already lost their flowers. The wild\r\ncherry-trees did not flower before the 12th of May; on the other hand,\r\nthe cultivated or European ones, had already opened their blossoms on\r\nthe 24th of April. The black walnut-trees of this country had neither\r\nleaves nor flowers, when the European kind has large leaves and\r\nblossoms. From hence it appears, that trees brought over from Europe,\r\nof the same kind with the wild trees of America, flower much sooner\r\nthan the latter. I cannot say what is the reason of this forwardness of\r\nthe European trees in this country, unless they bring forth their\r\nblossoms as soon as they get a certain degree of warmth, which they\r\nhave in their native country. It seems, the European trees do not\r\nexpect, after a considerable degree of warmth, any such cold nights as\r\nwill kill their flowers; for, in the cold countries, there seldom\r\nhappen any hot days succeeded by such cold nights as will hurt the\r\nflowers considerably. On the contrary, the wild trees in this country\r\nare directed by experience, (if I may so speak) not to trust to the\r\nfirst warmth; but they wait for a greater heat, when they are already\r\nsafe from cold nights. Therefore, it happens often, that the flowers of\r\nthe European trees are killed by the frosts here; but the native trees\r\nare seldom hurt, though they be of the same kind with the European\r\nones. This is a manifest proof of the wisdom of the Creator.\r\n\r\nMay the 5th. Early this morning I went to Rapaapo, which is a great\r\nvillage, whose farms ly all scattered. It was inhabited merely by\r\nSwedes, and not a single Englishman, or people of any other nation,\r\nlived in it: therefore they have preserved their native Swedish tongue,\r\nand mixed but few English words with it. The intention of my journey\r\nwas partly to see the place, and to collect plants; and other natural\r\ncuriosities there; and partly to find the places where the White Cedar,\r\nor Cupressus thyoides, grows.\r\n\r\nThe Mayflowers, as the Swedes call them, were plentiful in the woods\r\nwhere-ever I went to-day; especially on a dry soil, or one that is\r\nsomewhat moist. The Swedes have given them this name, because they are\r\nin full blossom in May. Some of the Swedes and the Dutch call them\r\nPinxterbloem, (Whitsunday flowers), as they really are in blossom about\r\nWhitsuntide. The English call them Wild Honeysuckles; and at a distance\r\nthey have some similarity to the Honeysuckle, or Lonicera. Dr. Linnæus,\r\nand other botanists, call it an Azalea [40]. Its flowers were now open,\r\nand added a new ornament to the woods, being little inferior to the\r\nflowers of the honeysuckle and Hedysarum. They sit in a circle round\r\nthe stem’s extremity, and have either a dark red or a lively red\r\ncolour; but, by standing for some time, the sun bleaches them, and at\r\nlast they get a whitish hue. I know not why Colden calls them yellow\r\n[41]. The height of the bush is not always alike. Some were as tall as\r\na full grown man, and taller, others were but low, and some were not\r\nabove a palm from the ground; yet they were all full of flowers. The\r\npeople have not yet found that this plant may be applied to any use;\r\nthey only gather the flowers, and put them in pots, because they are\r\nvery shewy. They have some smell; but I cannot say it is very pleasant.\r\nHowever, the beauty of the colour entitles them to a place in every\r\nflower-garden.\r\n\r\nTo-day I saw the first ear of this year’s rye. In Sweden, rye begins to\r\nshew its ears about Ericmas, that is, about the 18th of May, old stile\r\n[42]. But in New Sweden, the people said, they always saw the ears of\r\nrye in April, old stile; whether the spring begins late or early.\r\nHowever, in some years the ears come early, and in others late, in\r\nApril. This spring was reckoned one of the late ones.\r\n\r\nBullfrogs [43] are a large species of frogs, which I had an opportunity\r\nof hearing and seeing to-day. As I was riding out, I heard a roaring\r\nbefore me; and I thought it was a bull in the bushes, on the other side\r\nof the dyke, though the sound was rather more hoarse than that of a\r\nbull. I was however afraid, that a bad goring bull might be near me,\r\nthough I did not see him; and I continued to think so till some hours\r\nafter, when I talked with some Swedes about the Bullfrogs, and, by\r\ntheir account, I immediately found that I had heard their voice; for\r\nthe Swedes told me, that there were numbers of them in the dyke. I\r\nafterwards hunted for them. Of all the frogs in this country, this is\r\ndoubtless the greatest. I am told, that towards autumn, as soon as the\r\nair begins to grow a little cool, they hide themselves under the mud,\r\nwhich lies at the bottom of ponds and stagnant waters, and ly there\r\ntorpid during winter. As soon as the weather grows mild, towards\r\nsummer, they begin to get out of their holes, and croak. If the spring,\r\nthat is, if the mild weather, begins early, they appear about the end\r\nof March, old stile; but if it happens late, they tarry under water\r\ntill late in April. Their places of abode are ponds, and bogs with\r\nstagnant water; they are never in any flowing water. When many of them\r\ncroak together, they make an enormous noise. Their croak exactly\r\nresembles the roaring of an ox or bull, which is somewhat hoarse. They\r\ncroak so loud, that two people talking by the side of a pond cannot\r\nunderstand each other. They croak all together; then stop a little, and\r\nbegin again. It seems as if they had a captain among them: for when he\r\nbegins to croak, all the others follow; and when he stops, the others\r\nare all silent. When this captain gives the signal for stopping, you\r\nhear a note like poop coming from him. In day-time they seldom make any\r\ngreat noise, unless the sky is covered. But the night is their croaking\r\ntime; and, when all is calm, you may hear them, though you are near a\r\nmile and a half off. When they croak, they commonly are near the\r\nsurface of the water, under the bushes, and have their heads out of the\r\nwater. Therefore, by going slowly, one may get close up to them before\r\nthey go away. As soon as they are quite under water, they think\r\nthemselves safe, though the water be very shallow.\r\n\r\nSometimes they sit at a good distance from the pond; but as soon as\r\nthey suspect any danger, they hasten with great leaps into the water.\r\nThey are very expert at hopping. A full-grown Bullfrog takes near three\r\nyards at one hop. I have often been told the following story by the old\r\nSwedes, which happened here, at the time when the Indians lived with\r\nthe Swedes. It is well known, that the Indians are excellent runners; I\r\nhave seen them, at Governor Johnson’s, equal the best horse in its\r\nswiftest course, and almost pass by it. Therefore, in order to try how\r\nwell the bull-frogs could leap, some of the Swedes laid a wager with a\r\nyoung Indian, that he could not overtake the frog, provided it had two\r\nleaps before hand. They carried a bull-frog, which they had caught in a\r\npond, upon a field, and burnt his back-side; the fire, and the Indian,\r\nwho endeavoured to be closely up with the frog, had such an effect upon\r\nthe animal, that it made its long hops across the field, as fast as it\r\ncould. The Indian began to pursue the frog with all his might at the\r\nproper time: the noise he made in running frightened the poor frog;\r\nprobably it was afraid of being tortured with fire again, and therefore\r\nit redoubled its leaps, and by that means it reached the pond before\r\nthe Indian could over-take it.\r\n\r\nIn some years they are more numerous than in others: nobody could tell,\r\nwhether the snakes had ever ventured to eat them, though they eat all\r\nthe lesser kinds of frogs. The women are no friends to these frogs,\r\nbecause they kill and eat young ducklings and goslings: sometimes they\r\ncarry off chickens that come too near the ponds. I have not observed\r\nthat they bite when they are held in the hands, though they have little\r\nteeth; when they are beaten, they cry out almost like children. I was\r\ntold that some eat the thighs of the hind legs, and that they are very\r\npalatable.\r\n\r\nA tree which grows in the swamps here, and in other parts of America,\r\ngoes by the name of White Juniper-tree. Its stem indeed looks like one\r\nof our old tall and strait juniper-trees in Sweden: but the leaves are\r\ndifferent, and the wood is white. The English call it White Cedar,\r\nbecause the boards which are made of the wood, are like those made of\r\ncedar. But neither of these names are just, for the tree is of the\r\ncypress kind [44]. It always grows in wet ground or swamps: it is\r\ntherefore difficult to come to them, because the ground between the\r\nlittle hillocks is full of water. The trees stand both on the hillocks\r\nand in the water: they grow very close together, and have strait,\r\nthick, and tall stems; but they were greatly reduced in number to what\r\nthey have been before. In such places where they are left to grow up,\r\nthey grow as tall and as thick as the tallest fir-trees; they preserve\r\ntheir green leaves both in winter and summer; the tall ones have no\r\nbranches on the lower part of the stem.\r\n\r\nThe marshes where these trees grow are called Cedar Swamps. These cedar\r\nswamps are numerous in New Jersey, and likewise in some parts of\r\nPensylvania and New York. The most northerly place, where it has been\r\nhitherto found, is near Goshen in New York, under forty-one degrees and\r\ntwenty-live minutes of north latitude, as I am informed by Dr. Colden.\r\nFor to the North of Goshen, it has not been found in the woods. The\r\nwhite cedar is one of the trees, which resist the most to putrefaction;\r\nand when it is put above ground, it will last longer than under ground:\r\ntherefore it is employed for many purposes; it makes good fences, and\r\nposts which are to be put into the ground; but in this point, the red\r\ncedar is still preferable to the white; it likewise makes good canoes.\r\nThe young trees are employed for hoops, round barrels, tuns, &c.\r\nbecause they are thin and pliable; the thick and tall trees afford\r\ntimber, and wood for cooper’s work. The houses which are built of it,\r\nsurpass in duration, those which are built of American oak. Many of the\r\nhouses in Rapaapo were made of this white cedar wood; but the chief\r\nthing which the white cedar affords is the best kind of shingles. The\r\nwhite cedar shingles are preferred to all others for several reasons;\r\nfirst, they are more durable than any others made of American wood, the\r\nred cedar shingles excepted; secondly, they are very light, so that no\r\nstrong beams are requisite to support the roof. For the same reason it\r\nis unnecessary to build thick walls, because they are not pressed by\r\nheavy roofs. When fires break out, it is less dangerous to go under or\r\nalong the roofs, because the shingles being very light can do little\r\nhurt by falling; they suck the water, being somewhat spungy, so that\r\nthe roofs can easily be wetted in case of a fire: however, their\r\nfatness occasions that the water does not hurt them, but evaporates\r\neasily. When they burn and are carried about by the wind, they have\r\ncommonly what is called a dead coal, which does not easily set fire\r\nwhere it alights. The roofs made of these shingles can easily be cut\r\nthrough, if required, because they are thin, and not very hard; for\r\nthese qualities the people in the country, and in the towns, are very\r\ndesirous of having their houses covered with white cedar shingles, if\r\nthe wood can be got. Therefore all churches, and the houses of the more\r\nsubstantial inhabitants of the towns, have shingle roofs. In many parts\r\nof New York province, where the white cedar does not grow, the people,\r\nhowever, have their houses roofed with cedar shingles, which they get\r\nfrom other parts. To that purpose great quantities of shingles are\r\nannually exported from Eggharbour and other parts of New Jersey, to the\r\ntown of New York, from whence they are distributed throughout the\r\nprovince. A quantity of white cedar wood is likewise exported every\r\nyear to the West Indies, for shingles, pipe staves, &c. Thus the\r\ninhabitants are very busy here, not only to lessen the number of these\r\ntrees, but even to extirpate them entirely. They are here (and in many\r\nother places) in regard to wood, bent only upon their own present\r\nadvantage, utterly regardless of posterity. By this means many cedar\r\nswamps are already quite destitute of cedars, having only young shoots\r\nleft; and I plainly observed, by counting the circles round the stem,\r\nthat they do not grow up very quickly, but require a great deal of time\r\nbefore they can be cut for timber. It is well known that a tree gets\r\nonly one circle every year; a stem, eighteen inches in diameter, had\r\none hundred and eight circles round the thicker end; another, seventeen\r\ninches in diameter, had a hundred and sixteen; and another, two feet in\r\ndiameter, had one hundred and forty-two circles upon it. Thus near\r\neighty years growth is required, before a White cedar raised from seed\r\ncan be used for timber. Among the advantages which the white cedar\r\nshingles have over others, the people reckon their lightness. But this\r\ngood and useful quality may in future times turn out very\r\ndisadvantageous to Philadelphia, and other places where the houses are\r\nrooted with cedar shingles; for as the roofs made of these shingles are\r\nvery light, and bear but a trifling weight on the walls, so the people\r\nhave made the walls but very thin. I measured the thickness of the\r\nwalls of several houses here, of three stories high (cellar and garret\r\nnot included), and found most of them nine inches and a half, and some\r\nten inches thick; therefore it is by no means surprising, that violent\r\nhurricanes sometimes make the brick gable-ends to vibrate apparently,\r\nespecially on such houses as have a very open situation. And since the\r\ncedar-trees will soon be wanting in this country, and the present roofs\r\nwhen rotten must be supplied with heavier ones, of tiles, or of other\r\nwood, it is more than probable, that the thin walls will not be able to\r\nbear such an additional weight, and will either break, or require to be\r\nsupported by props: or else the whole house must be pulled down and\r\nrebuilt with thicker walls. This observation has already been made by\r\nothers. Some of the people here make use of the chips of white cedar\r\ninstead of tea, alluring me that they preferred it in regard to its\r\nwholesomeness to all foreign tea. All the inhabitants here were of\r\nopinion, that the water in the cedar swamps is wholesomer than any\r\nother drink: it creates a great appetite, which they endeavoured to\r\nprove by several examples. They ascribed this quality to the water\r\nitself, which is filled with the rosin of the trees, and to the\r\nexhalations which came from the trees, and can easily be smelled. The\r\npeople likewise thought that the yellowish colour of the water, which\r\nstands between the cedar trees, was owing to the rosin, which comes out\r\nof the roots of these trees. They likewise all agreed, that this water\r\nis always very cold in the hottest season, which may be partly owing to\r\nthe continual shade it is in. I knew several people who were resolved\r\nto go to these cedar swamps, and use the waters for the recovery of\r\ntheir appetite. Mr. Bartram planted a white cedar in a dry soil, but it\r\ncould not succeed there: he then put it into a swampy ground, where it\r\ngot as it were new life, and came on very well; and though it was not\r\ntaller than a man, yet it was full of cones. Another thing is very\r\nremarkable, with regard to the propagation of this tree: Mr. Bartram\r\ncut its branches in spring two years successively, and put them into\r\nthe swampy soil, where they struck roots, and succeeded very well. I\r\nhave seen them myself.\r\n\r\nThe red Juniper-tree is another tree which I have mentioned very\r\nfrequently in the course of my account. The Swedes have given it the\r\nname of red Juniper, because the wood is very red and fine within. The\r\nEnglish call it red Cedar, and the French Cedre rouge. However, the\r\nSwedish name is the most proper, as the tree belongs to the Junipers\r\n[45]. At its first growth it has a deal of similarity to the Swedish\r\nJuniper [46], but after it is grown up it gets quite different leaves.\r\nThe berry exactly resembles that of the Swedish Juniper, in regard to\r\nits colour and shape; however, they are not so big, though the red\r\nCedar grows very tall. At Raccoon these trees stood single, and were\r\nnot very tall. But at other places I have seen them standing together\r\nin clusters; they like the same ground as the common Swedish Juniper,\r\nespecially on the rising banks of rivers, and on other rising grounds,\r\nin a dry, and frequently in a poor soil. I have seen them growing in\r\nabundance, as thick and tall as the tallest fir-trees, on poor dry and\r\nsandy heaths. Towards Canada, or in the most northerly places, where I\r\nhave seen them, they commonly choose the steep sides of the mountains,\r\nand there they grow promiscuously with the common Juniper. The most\r\nnortherly places where I have found them wild in the woods, is in\r\nCanada, eighteen French miles to the southward of the Fort Saint Jean,\r\nor St. John, in about 44° 35′ North Latitude. I have likewise seen it\r\ngrowing very well in a garden, on the island of Magdalene [47],\r\nbelonging to the then governor of Montreal, Monsieur le Baron de\r\nLongueuil. But it had been got at more southerly places, and was\r\ntransplanted here. Of all the woods in this country, this is without\r\nexception the most durable, and withstands putrefaction longer than any\r\nother; it is therefore employed in all such cases where it is most\r\nliable to rot, especially for all kinds of posts which are to be put\r\ninto the ground. Some people say, that if an iron be put into the\r\nground along with a pole of cedar, the iron would be half corroded by\r\nrust in the same time that the wood would be rotten. In many places\r\nboth the fences, and the posts belonging to them, are made of red\r\ncedar. The best canoes, consisting of a single piece of wood, are made\r\nof red cedar; for they last longer than any others, and are very light.\r\nIn New York I have seen pretty large yachts build of red cedar. Several\r\nyachts which go from New York to Albany, up the river Hudson, are built\r\nin a different manner, as I have mentioned in the first volume [48]. In\r\nPhiladelphia they cannot make any yachts or other boats of red cedar,\r\nbecause the quantity and the size of the trees will not allow of it.\r\nFor the same reason they do not roof their houses with red cedar\r\nshingles; but in such places where it is plentiful, it makes excellent\r\ngood roofs. The heart of this cedar is of a fine red colour, and\r\nwhatever is made of it looks very fine, and has a very agreeable and\r\nwholesome smell. But the colour fades by degrees, or else the wood\r\nwould be exceedingly proper for cabinet work. I saw a parlour in the\r\ncountry seat of Mr. Norris, one of the Members of the Pensylvanian\r\nHouse of Assembly, wainscotted many years ago with boards of red cedar.\r\nMr. Norris assured me that the cedar looked exceedingly well in the\r\nbeginning, but it was quite faded when I saw it, and the boards looked\r\nvery shabby, especially the boards near the window had entirely lost\r\ntheir colour; so that Mr. Norris had been obliged to put mahogany in\r\ntheir stead: however, I was told, that the wood will keep its colour if\r\na thin varnish is put upon it whilst it is fresh, and just after it has\r\nbeen planed, and if care is taken that the wood is not afterwards\r\nrubbed or hurt. At least it makes the wood keep its colour much longer\r\nthan commonly. Since it has a very pleasant smell, when fresh, some\r\npeople put the shavings and chips of it among their linen to secure it\r\nagainst being worm-eaten. Some likewise get bureaus, &c. made of red\r\ncedar, with the same view. But it is only useful for this purpose as\r\nlong as it is fresh, for it loses its smell after some time, and is\r\nthen no longer good for keeping off insects. It is sometimes sent to\r\nEngland, as timber, and sells very well. In many places round\r\nPhiladelphia, in the seats of the gentry, there was commonly an avenue,\r\nwith a row of these trees planted on both sides, leading from the high\r\nroad to the house. The lower branches were cut, and only a fine crown\r\nleft. In winter, when most other trees have lost their leaves, this\r\nlooks very fine. This tree has likewise a very slow growth; for a stem,\r\nthirteen inches and a quarter in diameter, had one hundred and\r\neighty-eight rings, or annual circles and another, eighteen inches in\r\ndiameter, had at least two hundred and fifty, for a great number of the\r\nrings were so fine that they could not be counted. This tree is\r\npropagated in the same manner as the common Juniper-tree is in Sweden,\r\nviz. chiefly by birds, which eat the berries and emit the seeds entire.\r\nTo encourage the planting of this useful tree, a description of the\r\nmethod of doing it, written by Mr. Bartram, was inserted in a\r\nPensylvania almanack, called Poor Richard Improved, for the year 1749.\r\nIn it was explained the manner of planting and augmenting the number of\r\nthese trees, and mention is made of some of the purposes to which they\r\nmay be employed.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I returned to Raccoon.\r\n\r\nMay the 6th. The Mulberry-trees (Morus rubra) about this time began to\r\nblossom, but their leaves were yet very small. The people divided them\r\ninto male and female trees or flowers; and said that those which never\r\nbore any fruit were males, and those which did, females.\r\n\r\nSmilax laurifolia was superabundant in all the swamps near this place.\r\nIts leaves were now beginning to come out, for it sheds them all every\r\nwinter; it climbs up along trees and shrubs, and runs across from one\r\ntree or bush to another: by this means it shuts up the passage between\r\nthe trees, fastening itself every where with its cirrhi or tendrils,\r\nand even on people, so that it is with the utmost difficulty one must\r\nforce a passage in the swamps and woods, where it is plentiful; the\r\nstalk towards the bottom is full of long spines, which are as strong as\r\nthe spines of a rose-bush, and catch hold of the clothes, and tear\r\nthem: this troublesome plant may sometimes bring you into imminent\r\ndanger, when botanizing or going into the woods, for, not to mention\r\nthat the cloaths must be absolutely ruined by its numberless spines, it\r\noccasions a deep shade in the woods, by crossing from tree to tree so\r\noften; this forces you to stoop, and even to creep on all fours through\r\nthe little passages which are left close to the ground, and then you\r\ncannot be careful enough to prevent a snake (of which there are numbers\r\nhere) from darting into your face. The stalk of the plant has the same\r\ncolour as the young rose-bushes. It is quite green and smooth between\r\nthe spines, so that a stranger would take it to be a kind of\r\nthorn-bush, in winter, when it is destitute of leaves.\r\n\r\nMay the 8th. The trees hereabouts were now stocked with innumerable\r\nCaterpillars; one kind especially was observable, which is worse than\r\nall the others. They immediately formed great white webs, between the\r\nbranches of the trees, so that they were perceptible, even at a\r\ndistance; in each of these webs were thousands of Caterpillars, which\r\ncrept out of them afterwards, and spread chiefly upon the apple-trees.\r\nThey consumed the leaves, and often left not one on a whole branch. I\r\nwas told, that some years ago they did so much damage, that the\r\napple-trees and peach-trees hardly bore any fruit at all; because they\r\nhad consumed all the leaves, and exposed the naked trees to the intense\r\nheat of the sun, by which means several of the trees died. The people\r\ntook the following method of killing these Caterpillars: They fixed\r\nsome straw or flax on a pole, set it on fire, and held it under the\r\nwebs or nests; by which a part was burnt, and a part fell to the\r\nground. However, numbers of the Caterpillars crept up the trees again,\r\nwhich could have been prevented, if they had been trod upon, or killed\r\nany other way. I called chickens to such places where they crept on the\r\nground in numbers; but they would not eat them. Nor did the wild birds\r\nlike them; for the trees were full of these webs, though whole flights\r\nof little birds had their nests in the gardens and orchards.\r\n\r\nMay the 18th. Though it was already pretty late in May, yet the nights\r\nwere very dark here. About an hour after sun-set, it was so dark, that\r\nit was impossible to read in a book, though the type was ever so large.\r\nAbout ten o’clock, on a clear night, the dark was so much increased,\r\nthat it looked like one of the darkest star-light nights in autumn, in\r\nSweden. It likewise seemed to me, that though the nights were clear,\r\nyet the stars did not give so great a light as they do in Sweden. And\r\nas, about this time, the nights are commonly dark, and the sky covered\r\nwith clouds; so I would compare them only to dark and cloudy Swedish\r\nwinter nights. It was therefore, at this time of the year, very\r\ndifficult to travel in such cloudy nights; for neither man nor horse\r\ncould find their way. The nights, in general, seem very disagreeable to\r\nme, in comparison to the light and glorious, summer nights of Sweden.\r\nIgnorance sometimes makes us think slightly of our country. If other\r\ncountries have their advantages, Sweden is not destitute of matter to\r\nboast of on this head: it likewise has its peculiar advantages; and\r\nupon weighing the advantages and inconveniencies of different places,\r\nSweden will be found to be not inferior to any of them.\r\n\r\nI will briefly mention in what points I think Sweden is preferable to\r\nthis part of America; and why I prefer Old Sweden to New Sweden.\r\n\r\nThe nights are very dark here all the summer; and in winter, they are\r\nquite as dark, if not darker, than the winter nights in Sweden; for\r\nhere is no kind of Aurora Borealis, and the stars give a very faint\r\nlight. It is very remarkable if an Aurora Borealis appears once or\r\ntwice a year. The winters here bring no snow, to make the nights clear,\r\nand to make travelling more safe and easy. The cold is, however,\r\nfrequently as intense as in Old Sweden. The snow which falls lies only\r\na few days, and always goes off with a great deal of wet. The\r\nRattle-snakes, Horned-snakes, red-bellied, green, and other poisonous\r\nSnakes, against whose bite there is frequently no remedy, are in great\r\nplenty here. To these I must add the wood-lice, with which the forests\r\nare so pestered, that it is impossible to pass through a bush without\r\nhaving a whole army of them on your cloaths, or to sit down, though the\r\nplace be ever so pleasant. The inconvenience and trouble they cause,\r\nboth to man and beast, I have described in the Memoirs of the Royal\r\nSwedish Academy of Sciences. The weather is so inconstant here, that\r\nwhen a day is most excessively hot, the next is often sensibly cold.\r\nThis sudden change often happens in one day; and few people can suffer\r\nthese changes, without impairing their health. The heat in summer is\r\nexcessive, and the cold in winter often very piercing. However, one can\r\nalways secure one’s self against the cold; but when the great heat is\r\nof any duration, there is hardly any remedy against it. It tires one\r\nso, that one does not know which way to turn. It has frequently\r\nhappened, that people who walked into the fields, dropped down dead, on\r\naccount of the violence of the heat. Several distempers prevail here;\r\nand they increase every year. Nobody is left unattacked by the\r\nintermitting fever; and many people are forced to suffer it every year,\r\ntogether with other diseases. Pease cannot be sown, on account of the\r\ninsects which consume them [49]. There are worms in the grains of rye,\r\nand numbers of them are in the cherry-trees. The caterpillars often eat\r\nall the leaves from the trees, so that they cannot bear fruit in that\r\nyear; and numbers die every year, both of fruit-trees and forest-trees.\r\nThe grass in the meadows is likewise consumed by a kind of worms, and\r\nanother species cause the plumbs to drop, before they are half ripe.\r\nThe oak here affords not near so good timber as the European oak. The\r\nfences cannot stand above eighteen years. The houses are of no long\r\nduration. The meadows are poor, and what grass they have is bad. The\r\npasture for cattle in the forests, consists of such plants as they do\r\nnot like, and which they are compelled to eat by necessity; for it is\r\ndifficult to find a single grass in great forests, where the trees\r\nstand far asunder, and where the soil is excellent. For this reason,\r\nthe cattle are forced, during almost the whole winter and part of the\r\nsummer, to live upon the young shoots and branches of trees, which\r\nsometimes have no leaves: therefore, the cows give very little milk,\r\nand decrease in size every generation. The houses are extremely unfit\r\nfor winter habitations. Hurricanes are frequent, which overthrow trees,\r\ncarry away roofs, and sometimes houses, and do a great deal of damage.\r\nSome of these inconveniencies might be remedied by art; but others will\r\neither admit of no alteration, or they will at least cost vast trouble.\r\nThus every country has its advantages, and its defects: happy is he who\r\ncan content himself with his own.\r\n\r\nThe rye grows very ill in most of the fields, which is chiefly owing to\r\nthe carelessness in agriculture, and to the poorness of the fields,\r\nwhich are seldom or never manured. After the inhabitants have converted\r\na tract of land into fields, which had been a forest for many centuries\r\ntogether, and which consequently had a very fine soil, they use it as\r\nsuch, as long as it will bear any corn; and when it ceases to bear any,\r\nthey turn it into pastures for the cattle, and take new corn fields in\r\nanother place, where a fine soil can be met with, and where it has\r\nnever been made use of for this purpose. This kind of agriculture will\r\ndo for some time; but it will afterwards have bad consequences, as\r\nevery one may clearly see. A few of the inhabitants, however, treated\r\ntheir fields a little better: the English in general have carried\r\nagriculture to a higher degree of perfection than any other nation. But\r\nthe depth and richness of the soil, which those found here who came\r\nover from England, (as they were preparing land for ploughing which had\r\nbeen covered with woods from times immemorial) misled them, and made\r\nthem careless husbandmen. It is well known, that the Indians lived in\r\nthis country for several centuries before the Europeans came into it;\r\nbut it is likewise known, that they lived chiefly by hunting and\r\nfishing, and had hardly any fields. They planted maize, and some\r\nspecies of beans and gourds; and at the same time it is certain, that a\r\nplantation of such vegetables as serve an Indian family during one\r\nyear, take up no more ground than a farmer in our country takes to\r\nplant cabbage for his family upon; at least, a farmer’s cabbage and\r\nturnep ground, taken together, is always as extensive, if not more so,\r\nthan the corn-fields and kitchen-gardens of an Indian family.\r\nTherefore, the Indians could hardly subsist for one month upon the\r\nproduce of their gardens and fields. Commonly, the little villages of\r\nIndians are about twelve or eighteen miles distant from each other.\r\nFrom hence one may judge, how little ground was formerly employed for\r\ncorn-fields; and the rest was overgrown with thick and tall trees. And\r\nthough they cleared (as is yet usual) new ground, as soon as the old\r\none had quite lost its fertility; yet such little pieces as they made\r\nuse of were very inconsiderable, when compared to the vast forests\r\nwhich remained. Thus the upper fertile soil increased considerably, for\r\ncenturies together; and the Europeans coming to America found a rich\r\nand fine soil before them, lying as loose between the trees as the best\r\nbed in a garden. They had nothing to do but to cut down the wood, put\r\nit up in heaps, and to clear the dead leaves away. They could then\r\nimmediately proceed to ploughing, which in such loose ground is very\r\neasy; and having sown their corn, they got a most plentiful harvest.\r\nThis easy method of getting a rich crop has spoiled the English and\r\nother European inhabitants, and induced them to adopt the same method\r\nof agriculture which the Indians make use of; that is, to sow\r\nuncultivated grounds, as long as they will produce a crop without\r\nmanuring, but to turn them into pastures as soon as they can bear no\r\nmore, and to take in hand new spots of ground, covered since time\r\nimmemorial with woods, which have been spared by the fire or the\r\nhatchet ever since the creation. This is likewise the reason why\r\nagriculture, and the knowledge of this useful branch, is so imperfect\r\nhere, that one can learn nothing on a great tract of land, neither of\r\nthe English, nor of the Swedes, Germans, Dutch, and French; except\r\nthat, from their gross mistakes and carelessness for futurity, one\r\nfinds opportunities every day of making all sorts of observations, and\r\nof growing wise at the expence of other people. In a word, the\r\ncorn-fields, the meadows, the forests, the cattle, &c. are treated with\r\nequal carelessness; and the English nation, so well skilled in these\r\nbranches of husbandry, is with difficulty found out here. We can hardly\r\nbe more lavish of our woods in Sweden and Finland than they are here:\r\ntheir eyes are fixed upon the present gain, and they are blind to\r\nfuturity. Every day their cattle are harassed by labour, and each\r\ngeneration decreases in goodness and size, by being kept short of food,\r\nas I have before mentioned. On my travels in this country I observed\r\nseveral plants, which the horses and cows preferred to all others. They\r\nwere wild in this country, and likewise grew well on the driest and\r\npoorest ground, where no other plants would succeed. But the\r\ninhabitants did not know how to turn this to their advantage; owing to\r\nthe little account made of Natural History, that science being here (as\r\nin other parts of the world) looked upon as a mere trifle, and the\r\npastime of fools. I am certain, and my certainty is founded upon\r\nexperience, that by means of these plants, in the space of a few years,\r\nI have been able to turn the poorest ground, which would hardly afford\r\nfood for a cow, into the richest and most fertile meadow, where great\r\nflocks of cattle have found superfluous food, and are grown fat upon. I\r\nown, that these useful plants were not to be found on the grounds of\r\nevery planter: but with a small share of natural knowledge, a man would\r\neasily collect them in the places where they were to be got. I was\r\nastonished, when I heard the country people complaining of the badness\r\nof the pastures; but I likewise perceived their negligence, and often\r\nsaw excellent plants growing on their own grounds, which only required\r\na little more attention and assistance from their unexperienced owners.\r\nI found every where the wisdom and goodness of the Creator; but too\r\nseldom saw any acknowledgment, or adequate estimation of it, among men.\r\n\r\n\r\n        O fortunatos nimium sua si bona norint,\r\n        Agricolas!\r\n\r\n                                        Virg. Georgic.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been led to these reflections, which may perhaps seem foreign to\r\nmy purpose, by the bad and neglected state of agriculture in every part\r\nof this continent. I likewise intended to shew the reason why this\r\njournal is so thinly stocked with œconomical advantages in the several\r\nbranches of husbandry. I do not however deny, that I have sometimes\r\nfound one or two skilful œconomists, but they were very scarce.\r\n\r\nBirds of prey which pursue the poultry are found in abundance here, and\r\nif possible more plentiful than in Sweden. They enjoy great liberty\r\nhere, as there are still great forests in many places, from whence they\r\ncan come unawares upon chickens and ducks. To the birds of prey it is\r\nquite indifferent whether the woods consist of good or bad trees,\r\nprovided they are in shade. At night the owls, which are very numerous,\r\nendanger the safety of the tame fowls. They live chiefly in marshes,\r\ngive a disagreeable shriek at night, and attack the chickens, which\r\ncommonly roost at night in the apple-trees, peach-trees, and\r\ncherry-trees, in the garden. But since they are very busy in clearing\r\nthis country of woods, as we are in Sweden and Finland, it may be of\r\nuse for exposing the birds of prey, more than they are now, and for\r\ndepriving them of the opportunities of doing mischief with so much\r\nease.\r\n\r\nThe thick forests of America contain numbers of stags; they do not seem\r\nto be a different species from the European stags. An Englishman was\r\npossessed of a tame hind. It is observable that though these creatures\r\nare very shy when wild in the woods and the cedar swamps, which are\r\nvery much frequented by them, yet they can be tamed to such a degree,\r\nif taken young, that they will come of their own accord to people, and\r\neven to strangers: This hind was caught when it was but very little;\r\nthe colour of the whole body was a dirty reddish brown, the belly and\r\nthe under side of the tail excepted, which were white; the ears were\r\ngrey; the head, towards the snout, was very narrow, but upon the whole\r\nthe creature looked very fine. The hair lay close together, and was\r\nquite short; the tail reached almost to the bend of the knee, near\r\nwhich, on the inside of each hind-foot, was a knob or callus. The\r\npossessor of the hind said, that he had tamed several stags, by\r\ncatching them whilst they were very young. It was now big with young\r\nones. It had a little bell hung about its neck, that by walking in the\r\nwoods, the people might know it to be tame, and take care not to shoot\r\nit. It was at liberty to go where it pleased, and to keep it confined\r\nwould have been a pretty hard task, as it could leap over the highest\r\nenclosures. Sometimes it went far into the woods, and frequently staid\r\naway a night or two, but afterwards returned home like other cattle.\r\nWhen it went into the woods, it was often accompanied by wild stags,\r\nand decoyed them even into the very houses, especially in rutting time,\r\ngiving its master numerous opportunities of shooting the wild stags,\r\nalmost at his door. Its scent was excellent, and when it was turned\r\ntowards the wind, I often saw it rising and looking towards that part,\r\nthough I did not see any people on the road, but they commonly appeared\r\nabout an hour after. As soon as the wild stags have the scent of a man,\r\nthey make off. In winter the man fed the hind with corn and hay; but in\r\nsummer it went out into the woods and meadows, seeking its own food,\r\neating both grass and other plants: it was now kept in a meadow; it did\r\nchiefly eat clover, the leaves of hiccory, of the Andromeda paniculata,\r\nand the Geranium maculatum. It was likewise contented with the leaves\r\nof the common plantane, or Plantaga, grasses, and several other plants.\r\nThe possessor of this hind sold stags to people in Philadelphia, who\r\nsent them as curiosities to other places. He got twenty-five, thirty,\r\nand forty shillings a-piece for them. The food of the wild stags in\r\nsummer is grass and several plants; but in winter, when they are not to\r\nbe got, they eat the shoots and young sprigs of branches. I have\r\nalready mentioned [50] that they eat without any danger the spoon-tree,\r\nor Kalmia latifolia, which is poison to other animals. In the long and\r\nsevere winter, which commenced here upon the tenth of December, 1740,\r\nand continued to the thirteenth of March, old stile, during the course\r\nof which there fell a great quantity of snow, the stags were found dead\r\nin the snow, but chiefly higher up the country, where the snow was\r\ndeeper. Nobody could determine whether their death was the consequence\r\nof the great quantity and depth of snow, which hindered their getting\r\nout, or whether the frost had been too severe, and of too long\r\nduration, or whether they were short of food. The old people likewise\r\nrelate, that vast numbers of stags came down in the year 1705, when\r\nthere was a heavy fall of snow, near a yard deep, and that they were\r\nafterwards found dead in the woods, in great numbers, because the snow\r\nwas deeper than they could pass through. Numbers of birds were likewise\r\nfound dead at that time. In that same winter, a stag came to Matsong\r\ninto the stables, and ate hay together with the cattle. It was so\r\npinched by hunger, that it grew tame immediately, and did not run away\r\nfrom people. It afterwards continued in the house, as another tame\r\ncreature. All aged persons asserted, that formerly this country\r\nabounded more with stags than it does at present. It was formerly not\r\nuncommon to see thirty or forty of them in a flock together. The reason\r\nof their decrease is chiefly owing to the increase of population, the\r\ndestruction of the woods, and the number of people who kill and\r\nfrighten the stags at present. However, high up in the country, in\r\ngreat forests and desarts, there are yet great numbers of them. Among\r\ntheir enemies is the Lynx of this country, which is the same with the\r\nSwedish one [51]. They climb up the trees, and when the stags pass by,\r\nthey dart down upon him, get fast hold, bite, and suck the blood, and\r\nnever give over till they have killed it.\r\n\r\nI saw several holes in the ground, both on hills and on fields, and\r\nfallow grounds; they were round, and commonly about an inch wide; they\r\nwent almost perpendicularly into the earth, and were made by\r\ndung-beetles, or by great worms, which are made use of for angling. The\r\ndung-beetles had dug very deep into the ground, thro’ horse-dung, tho’\r\nit lay on the hardest road, so that a great heap of earth lay near it.\r\nThese holes were afterwards occupied by other insects, especially\r\ngrasshoppers, (Grylli) and Cicadæ; for by digging these holes up, I\r\ncommonly found one or more young ones of these insects, which had not\r\nyet got their perfect size.\r\n\r\nMay the 19th. This morning I left Raccoon, a parish in the country\r\ncalled New Sweden, and which is yet chiefly inhabited by Swedes, in\r\norder to proceed in my travels to the North. I first intended to set\r\nout with the beginning of April, but for several reasons this was not\r\nadviseble. No leaves were come out at that time, and hardly any flowers\r\nappeared. I did not know what flowers grew here in spring; for the\r\nautumnal plants are different from the vernal ones. The Swedes had this\r\nwinter told me the œconomical and medical uses of many plants, to which\r\nthey gave names unknown to me: they could not then shew me those plants\r\non account of the season, and by their deficient and erroneous\r\ndescriptions, I was not able to guess what plants they meant. By going\r\naway so early as the beginning of April, I would have remained in\r\nuncertainty in regard to these things. It was therefore fit, that I\r\nshould spend a part of the spring at Raccoon, especially as I had still\r\ntime enough left for my tour to the North.\r\n\r\nOn the road we saw a Black Snake, which we killed, and found just five\r\nfoot long. Catesby has described it and its qualities, and also drawn\r\nit [52]. The full-grown Black Snakes are commonly about five feet long,\r\nbut very slender; the thickest I ever saw was in the broadest part\r\nhardly three inches thick; the back is black, shining, and smooth; the\r\nchin white and smooth; the belly whitish turning into blue, shining,\r\nand very smooth; I believe there are some varieties of this snake. One\r\nwhich was nineteen inches long, had a hundred and eighty-six scales on\r\nthe belly, (Scuta Abdominalia) and ninety-two half scales on the tail\r\n(Squamæ subcaudales), which I found to be true, by a repeated counting\r\nof the scales. Another, which was seventeen inches and a half in\r\nlength, had a hundred and eighty-four scales on the belly, and only\r\nsixty-four half scales on the tail; this I likewise assured myself of,\r\nby counting the scales over again. It is possible that the end of this\r\nlast snake’s tail was cut off, and the wound healed up again [53].\r\n\r\nThe country abounds with Black Snakes. They are among the first that\r\ncome out in spring, and often appear very early if warm weather\r\nhappens; but if it grows cold again after that, they are quite frozen,\r\nand lie stiff and torpid on the ground or on the ice; when taken in\r\nthis state and put before a fire, they revive in less than an hour’s\r\ntime. It has sometimes happened, when the beginning of January is very\r\nwarm, that they come out of their winter habitations. They commonly\r\nappear about the end of March, old style.\r\n\r\nThis is the swiftest of all the snakes which are to be found here, for\r\nit moves so quick, that a dog can hardly catch it. It is therefore\r\nalmost impossible for a man to escape it if pursued: but happily its\r\nbite is neither poisonous nor any way dangerous; many people have been\r\nbit by it in the woods, and have scarce felt any more inconvenience\r\nthan if they had been wounded by a knife; the wounded place only\r\nremains painful for some time. The Black Snakes seldom do any harm,\r\nexcept in spring, when they copulate; but if any body comes in their\r\nway at that time, they are so much vexed, as to pursue him as fast as\r\nthey can. If they meet with a person who is afraid of them, he is in\r\ngreat distress. I am acquainted with several people, who have on such\r\nan occasion run so hard as to be quite out of breath, in endeavouring\r\nto escape the snake, which moved with the swiftness of an arrow after\r\nthem. If a person thus pursued can muster up courage enough to oppose\r\nthe snake with a stick or any thing else, when it is either passed by\r\nhim, or when he steps aside to avoid it, it will turn back again, and\r\nseek a refuge in its swiftness. It is, however, sometimes bold enough\r\nto run directly upon a man, and not to depart before it has received a\r\ngood stroke. I have been assured by several, that when it overtakes a\r\nperson, who has tried to escape it, and who has not courage enough to\r\noppose it, it winds round his feet, so as to make him fall down; it\r\nthen bites him several times in the leg, or whatever part it can get\r\nhold of, and goes off again. I shall mention two circumstances, which\r\nconfirm what I have said. During my stay in New York, Dr. Colden told\r\nme, that in the spring, 1748, he had several workmen at his country\r\nseat, and among them one lately arrived from Europe, who of course knew\r\nvery little of the qualities of the Black Snake. The other workmen\r\nseeing a great Black Snake copulating with its female, engaged the new\r\ncomer to go and kill it, which he intended to do with a little stick.\r\nBut on approaching the place where the snakes lay, they perceived him,\r\nand the male in great wrath leaves his pleasure to pursue the fellow\r\nwith amazing swiftness; he little expected such courage in the snake,\r\nand flinging away his stick, began to run as fast as he was able. The\r\nsnake pursued him, overtook him, and twisting several times round his\r\nfeet, threw him down, and frightened him almost out of his senses; he\r\ncould not get rid of the snake, till he took a knife and cut it through\r\nin two of three places. The other Workmen were rejoiced at this sight,\r\nand laughed at it, without offering to help their companion. Many\r\npeople at Albany told me of an accident which happened to a young lady,\r\nwho went out of town in summer, together with many other girls,\r\nattended by her negro. She sat down in the wood, in a place where the\r\nothers were running about, and before she was aware, a Black Snake\r\nbeing disturbed in its amours, ran under her petticoats, and twisted\r\nround her waist, so that she fell backwards in a swoon occasioned by\r\nher fright, or by the compression which the snake caused. The negro\r\ncame up to her, and suspecting that a Black Snake might have hurt her,\r\non making use of a remedy to bring his lady to herself again, he lifted\r\nup her cloaths, and really found the snake wound about her body as\r\nclose as possible; the negro was not able to tear it away, and\r\ntherefore cut it, and the girl came to herself again; but she conceived\r\nso great an aversion to the negro, that she could not bear the sight of\r\nhim afterwards, and died of a consumption. At other times of the year\r\nthis snake is more apt to run away, than to attack people. However I\r\nhave heard it asserted frequently, that even in summer when its time of\r\ncopulation is past, it pursues people, especially children, if it finds\r\nthat they are afraid and run from her. Several people likewise assured\r\nme from their own experience, that it may be provoked to pursue people,\r\nif they throw at it, and then run away. I cannot well doubt of this, as\r\nI have heard it said by numbers of creditable people; but I could never\r\nsucceed in provoking them. I ran always away on perceiving it, or flung\r\nsomething at it, and then took to my heels, but I could never bring the\r\nsnakes to pursue me: I know not for what reason they shunned me, unless\r\nthey took me for an artful seducer.\r\n\r\nMost of the people in this country ascribed to this snake a power of\r\nfascinating birds and squirrels, as I have described in several parts\r\nof my Journal [54]. When the snake lies under a tree, and has fixed his\r\neyes on a bird or squirrel above; it obliges them to come down, and to\r\ngo directly into its mouth. I cannot account for this, for I never saw\r\nit done. However, I have a list of more than twenty persons, among\r\nwhich are some of the most creditable people, who have all unanimously,\r\nthough living far distant from each other, asserted the same thing;\r\nthey allured me upon their honor, that they have seen (at several\r\ntimes) these Black Snakes fascinating squirrels and birds which sat on\r\nthe tops of trees, the snake lying at the foot of the tree, with its\r\neyes fixed upon the bird or squirrel, which sits above it, and utters a\r\ndoleful note; from which it is easy to conclude with certainty that it\r\nis about to be fascinated, though you cannot see it. The bird or\r\nsquirrel runs up and down along the tree continuing its plaintive song,\r\nand always comes nearer the snake, whose eyes are unalterably fixed\r\nupon it. It should seem as if these poor creatures endeavoured to\r\nescape the snake, by hopping or running up the tree; but there appears\r\nto be a power which withholds them: they are forced downwards, and each\r\ntime that they turn back, they approach nearer their enemy, till they\r\nare at last forced to leap into its mouth, which stands wide open for\r\nthat purpose. Numbers of squirrels and birds are continually running\r\nand hopping fearless in the woods on the ground, where the snakes ly in\r\nwait for them, and can easily give these poor creatures a mortal bite.\r\nTherefore it seems that this fascination might be thus interpreted,\r\nthat the creature has first got a mortal wound from the snake, which is\r\nsure of her bite, and lies quiet, being assured that the wounded\r\ncreature has been poisoned with the bite, or at least feels pain from\r\nthe violence of the bite, and that it will at last be obliged to come\r\ndown into its mouth. The plaintive note is perhaps occasioned by the\r\nacuteness of the pain which the wound gives the creature. But to this\r\nit may be objected, that the bite of the Black Snake is not poisonous;\r\nit may further be objected, that if the snake could come near enough to\r\na bird or squirrel to give it a mortal bite, it might as easily keep\r\nhold of it, or, as it sometimes does with poultry, twist round and\r\nstrangle or stifle it. But the chief objection which lies against this\r\ninterpretation, is the following account, which I received from the\r\nmost creditable people, who have assured me of it. The squirrel being\r\nupon the point of running into the snake’s mouth, the spectators have\r\nnot been able to let it come to that pitch, but killed the snake, and\r\nas soon as it had got a mortal blow, the squirrel or bird destined for\r\ndestruction, flew away, and left off their moanful note, as if they had\r\nbroke loose from a net. Some say, that if they only touched the snake,\r\nso as to draw off its attention from the squirrel, it went off quickly,\r\nnot stopping till it had got to a great distance. Why do the squirrels\r\nor birds go away so suddenly, and why no sooner? If they had been\r\npoisoned or bitten by the snake before, so as not to be able to get\r\nfrom the tree, and to be forced to approach the snake always more and\r\nmore, they could however not get new strength by the snake being killed\r\nor diverted. Therefore, it seems that they are only enchanted, whilst\r\nthe snake has its eyes fixed on them. However, this looks odd and\r\nunaccountable, though many of the worthiest and most reputable people\r\nhave related it, and though it is so universally believed here, that to\r\ndoubt it would be to expose one’s self to general laughter.\r\n\r\nThe black snakes kill the smaller species of frogs, and eat them. If\r\nthey get at eggs of poultry, or of other birds, they make holes in\r\nthem, and suck the contents. When the hens are sitting on the eggs,\r\nthey creep into the nest, wind round the birds, stifle them, and suck\r\nthe eggs. Mr. Bartram asserted, that he had often seen this snake creep\r\nup into the tallest trees, after bird’s eggs, or young birds, always\r\nwith the head foremost, when descending. A Swede told me, that a black\r\nsnake had once got the head of one of his hens in its mouth, and was\r\nwound several times round the body, when he came and killed the snake.\r\nThe hen was afterwards as well as ever.\r\n\r\nThis snake is very greedy of milk, and it is difficult to keep it out,\r\nwhen it is once used to go into a cellar where milk is kept. It has\r\nbeen seen eating milk out of the same dish with children, without\r\nbiting them, though they often gave it blows with the spoon upon the\r\nhead, when it was overgreedy. I never heard it hissing. It can raise\r\nmore than one half of its body from the ground, in order to look about\r\nher. It skins every year; and its skin is said to be a remedy against\r\nthe cramp, if continually worn about the body.\r\n\r\nThe rye was now beginning to flower.\r\n\r\nI have often observed with astonishment, on my travels, the great\r\ndifference between the plants and the soil, on the two opposite banks\r\nof brooks. Sometimes a brook, which one can stride over, has plants on\r\none bank widely different from those on the opposite bank. Therefore,\r\nwhenever I came to a great brook or a river, I expected to find plants\r\nwhich I had not met with before. Their seeds are carried down with the\r\nstream from distant parts. The soil is likewise very often different on\r\nthe different sides of a rivulet, being rich and fertile on the one,\r\nand dry, barren, and sandy on the other. But a great river can make\r\nstill greater differences. Thus we see the great disparity between the\r\nprovince of Pensylvania, and New Jersey, which are only divided by the\r\nriver Delaware. In Pensylvania the soil consists of a mould mixed with\r\nsand and clay, and is very rich and fertile: and in the woods which are\r\nhigher in the country, the ground is mountainous and stony. On the\r\nother hand, in the province of New Jersey, the soil is poor and dry,\r\nand not very fertile, some parts excepted. You can hardly find a stone\r\nin New Jersey, and much less mountains. In Pensylvania you scarce ever\r\nsee a fir-tree, and in New Jersey are whole woods of it.\r\n\r\nThis evening I arrived at Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nMay the 22d. The locusts began to creep out of their holes in the\r\nground last night, and continued to do so to-day. As soon as their\r\nwings were dry, they began their song, which is almost sufficient to\r\nmake one deaf, when travelling through the woods. This year there was\r\nan immense number of them. I have given a minute account of them, of\r\ntheir food, qualities, &c. in the Memoirs of the Swedish Royal Academy\r\nof Sciences [55]; it is therefore needless to repeat it here, and I\r\nrefer the reader to the quoted place.\r\n\r\nMay the 25th. The tulip-tree (Liriodendron tulipifera) was now in full\r\nblossom. The flowers have a resemblance to tulips, and look very fine,\r\nand though they have not a very agreeable smell, yet the eye is pleased\r\nto see trees as tall as full-grown oaks, covered with tulip-like\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nOn the flowers of the tulip-tree was an olive-coloured Chafer\r\n(Scarabæus) without horns (muticus), the future and borders of his\r\nwing-shells (Elytræ) were black, and his thighs brown. I cannot with\r\ncertainty say whether they collected the pollen of the flower, or\r\nwhether they coupled. Later in summer, I saw the same kind of beetles\r\nmake deep holes into the ripe mulberries, either to eat them, or to lay\r\ntheir eggs in them. I likewise found them abundant in the leaves of the\r\nMagnolia glauca, or beaver-tree.\r\n\r\nThe strawberries were now ripe on the hills.\r\n\r\nThe country people already brought ripe cherries up to town; but they\r\nwere only a few to satisfy curiosity, yet we may form a judgment of the\r\nclimate from hence.\r\n\r\nMay the 26th. A peculiar kind of storm called a Travat, or Travado,\r\nhappened to-day. In the evening about ten o’clock, when the sky was\r\nquite clear, a thick, black cloud came rushing from the south-west,\r\nwith a wind. The air was quite calm, and we could not feel any breeze.\r\nBut the approach of this cloud was perceived from the strong rushing\r\nnoise in the woods to the south-west, and which encreased in proportion\r\nas the cloud came nearer. As soon as it was come up to us, it was\r\nattended by a violent gust of wind, which in its course threw down the\r\nweaker enclosures, carried them a good way along with it, and broke\r\ndown several trees. It was then followed by a hard shower of rain,\r\nwhich put an end to the storm, and every thing was calm as before.\r\nThese travadoes are frequent in summer, and have the quality of cooling\r\nthe air. However, they often do a deal of damage. They are commonly\r\nattended by thunder and lightning; as soon as they are passed over, the\r\nsky is as clear as it was before.\r\n\r\nMay the 28th. The Magnolia glauca was now in full bloom. Its flowers\r\nhave a very pleasant fragrancy, which refreshes the travellers in the\r\nwoods, especially towards the evening. The flowers of the wild vine\r\nafterwards supplied the place of those of the Magnolia. Several other\r\nflowers contribute likewise towards perfuming the ambient air.\r\n\r\nThe Kalmia angustifolia was now every where in flower. It grows chiefly\r\non sandy heaths, or on dry poor grounds, which few other plants will\r\nagree with; it is common in Pensylvania, but particularly in New\r\nJersey, and the province of New York, it is scarce in Canada; its\r\nleaves stay the winter; the flowers are a real ornament to the woods;\r\nthey grow in bunches like crowns, and are of a fine lively purple\r\ncolour; at the bottom is a circle of deep purple, and within it a\r\ngreyish or whitish colour. The flowers grow as aforesaid, in bunches,\r\nround the extremity of the stalk, and make it look like a decorated\r\npyramid. The English at New York call this plant the Dwarf Laurel. Its\r\nqualities are the same with those of the Kalmia latifolia, viz. that it\r\nkills sheep and other lesser animals, when they eat plentifully of it.\r\nI do not know whether it is noxious to the greater cattle. It is not of\r\nany known use, and only serves to attract the eye whilst in flower.\r\n\r\nThe Kalmia latifolia was likewise in full blossom at present. It rivals\r\nthe preceding one, in the beauty of its colour; yet though they are\r\nconspicuous in regard to the colours and shape of their flowers, they\r\nare no ways remarkable for smell, such as the Magnolia is; for they\r\nhave little or no smell at all. So equally and justly does nature\r\ndistribute her gifts; no part of the creation has them all, each has\r\nits own, and none is absolutely without a share of them.\r\n\r\nMay the 30th. The Moravian Brethren, who arrived in great numbers from\r\nEurope, at New York, in May, brought two converted Greenlanders with\r\nthem. The Moravians who were already settled in America, immediately\r\nsent some of their brethren from Philadelphia to the new comers, in\r\norder to welcome them. Among these deputies were two North American\r\nIndians, who had been converted to their doctrine, and likewise two\r\nSouth American Indians, from Surinam. These three kinds of converted\r\nIndians accordingly met at New York. I had no opportunity of seeing\r\nthem; but all those who had seen them, and whom I conversed with,\r\nthought that they had plainly perceived a similarity in their features\r\nand shape, the Greenlanders being only somewhat smaller. They concluded\r\nfrom hence, that all these three kinds of Americans were the posterity\r\nof one and the same descendant of Noah, or that they were perhaps yet\r\nmore nearly related. How far their guesses are to be relied upon, I\r\ncannot determine.\r\n\r\nRipe cherries were now already pretty common, and consequently cheap.\r\n\r\nYams are a species of roots, which are cultivated in the hottest parts\r\nof America, for eating, as we do potatoes. It has not yet been\r\nattempted to plant them here, and they are brought from the West Indies\r\nin ships; therefore they are reckoned a rarity here, and as such I ate\r\nthem at Dr. Franklin’s to-day. They are white, and taste like common\r\npotatoes, but not quite so agreeable; and I think it would not be worth\r\nwhile to plant them in Sweden, though they might bear the climate. The\r\nplant these roots belong to is the Dioscorea alata.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants make plenty of cheese. They are not reckoned so good as\r\nEnglish cheese: however, some take them to be full as good when old;\r\nand so they seemed to me. A man from Boston in New-England told me,\r\nthat they made very good cheese there: but they take care to keep the\r\ncattle from salt water, especially those who live near the sea-coasts;\r\nfor it has been found, that the cheese will not become so good when the\r\ncows graze near salt water, as it will when they have fresh water.\r\nThis, however, wants nearer examination, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nMay the 31st. About noon I left Philadelphia, and went on board a small\r\nyacht, which sails continually up and down upon the river Delaware,\r\nbetween Trenton and Philadelphia. We sailed up the river with fair wind\r\nand weather. Sturgeons leaped often a fathom into the air. We saw them\r\ncontinuing this exercise all day, till we came to Trenton. The banks on\r\nthe Pensylvanian side were low; and those on the New Jersey side steep\r\nand sandy, but not very high. On both sides we perceived forests of\r\ntall trees, with deciduous leaves.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of this month, the forenoon was always calm; but\r\nimmediately after noon it began to blow gently, and sometimes pretty\r\nstrongly. This morning was likewise fair; and in the afternoon it was\r\ncloudy, but did not rain.\r\n\r\nThe banks of the river were sometimes high, and sometimes low. We saw\r\nsome small houses near the shore, in the woods; and, now and then, a\r\ngood house built of stone. The river now decreased visibly in breadth.\r\nAbout three o’clock this afternoon we passed Burlington.\r\n\r\nBurlington, the chief town in the province of New Jersey, and the\r\nresidence of the governor, is but a small town, about twenty miles from\r\nPhiladelphia, on the eastern side of the Delaware. The houses were\r\nchiefly built of stone, though they stood far distant from each other.\r\nThe town has a good situation, since ships of considerable burden can\r\nsail close up to it: but Philadelphia prevents its carrying on an\r\nextensive trade; for the proprietors of that place [56] have granted it\r\ngreat immunities, by which it is increased so as to swallow all the\r\ntrade of the adjacent towns. The house of the governor at Burlington is\r\nbut a small one: it is built of stone, close by the river side, and is\r\nthe first building in the town as you come from Philadelphia. It is\r\nobserved, that about the full moons, when the tides are highest, and\r\nthe high water at Cape Hinlopen comes at nine o’clock in the morning,\r\nit will be at Chester, on the river Delaware, about ten minutes after\r\none o’clock; at Philadelphia, about ten minutes after two o’clock; and\r\nat Burlington, about ten minutes after three o’clock; for the tide in\r\nthe river Delaware comes quite up to Trenton. These observations were\r\ncommunicated to me by Mr. Lewis Evans.\r\n\r\nThe banks of the river were now chiefly high and steep on the side of\r\nNew Jersey, consisting of a pale brick-coloured soil. On the\r\nPensylvanian side, they were gently sloping, and consisted of a\r\nblackish rich mould, mixed with particles of Glimmer (Mica). On the New\r\nJersey side appeared some firs; but seldom on the other, except in a\r\nfew places where they were accidentally brought over from New Jersey.\r\n\r\nTowards night, after the tide had begun to ebb and the wind was quite\r\nsubsided, we could not proceed, but dropped our anchor about seven\r\nmiles from Trenton, and passed the night there. The woods were full of\r\nFireflies, (Lampyris) which flew like sparks of fire between the trees,\r\nand sometimes across the river. In the marshes, the Bullfrogs now and\r\nthen began their hideous roaring; and more than a hundred of them\r\nroared together. The Whip-poor-will, or Goatsucker, was likewise heard\r\nevery where.\r\n\r\nJune the 1st. We continued our voyage this morning, after the rain was\r\nover. The river Delaware was very narrow here, and the banks the same\r\nas we found them yesterday, after we had passed Burlington. About eight\r\no’clock in the morning we arrived at Trenton [57].\r\n\r\nJune the 2d. This morning we left Trenton, and proceeded towards New\r\nYork. The country I have described before [58]. The fields were sown\r\nwith wheat, rye, maize, oats, hemp, and flax. In several places, we saw\r\nvery large pieces of ground with hemp.\r\n\r\nWe saw abundance of chesnut-trees in the woods. They often stood in\r\nexcessive poor ground, which was neither too dry nor too wet.\r\n\r\nTulip-trees did not appear on the road; but the people said there were\r\nsome in the woods.\r\n\r\nThe Beaver-tree (Magnolia glauca) grows in the swamps. It was now in\r\nflower, and the fragrancy of its blossoms had so perfumed the air, that\r\none could enjoy it before one approached the swamps; and this fine\r\nsmell likewise shewed that a beaver-tree was near us, though we often\r\nhappened not to see it.\r\n\r\nThe Phlox Glaberrima grows abundantly in the woods, and cuts a fine\r\nfigure with its red flowers. It grows in such soil here as in Europe is\r\noccupied by the Lychnis viscaria and Lychnis dioica, or red Catchfly\r\nand Campion. The Phlox maculata grows abundantly in wet ground, and has\r\nfine red and odoriferous flowers. It grows on low meadows, where in\r\nEurope the Meadow-pinks, or Lychnis flos cuculi, would be met with. By\r\nadding to these flowers the Bartsia coccinea, the Lobelia cardinalis,\r\nand the Monarda didyma, which grow wild in this country, they are\r\nundoubtedly altogether adorned with the finest red imaginable.\r\n\r\nThe Sassafras-tree was abundant in the woods, and near the inclosures.\r\n\r\nThe houses which we passed by were most of them wooden. In one place, I\r\nsaw the people building a house with walls of mere clay, which is\r\nlikewise employed in making ovens for baking.\r\n\r\nBuckwheat was already coming up in several places. We saw single plants\r\nof it all day in the woods, and in the fields, but always by the side\r\nof the road; from whence it may be concluded, that they spring up from\r\nlost and scattered seeds.\r\n\r\nLate this evening we arrived at New Brunswick [59].\r\n\r\nJune the 3d. At noon we went on board a yacht bound for New York, and\r\nsailed down the river, which had at first pretty high and steep banks,\r\nof red sandstone, on each side, which I have mentioned before. [60] Now\r\nand then, there was a farm-house on the high shore. As we came lower\r\ndown, we saw on both sides great fields and meadows, close up to the\r\nwater. We could not sail at random with the yacht; for the river was\r\noften shallow in some places, and sometimes in the very middle. For\r\nthat purpose, the course which we were to take was marked out by\r\nbranches with leaves on them. At last we got into the sea, which\r\nbounded our prospect on the south; but on the other side, we were\r\ncontinually in sight of land at some distance. On coming to the mouth\r\nof the river, we had a choice of two roads to New York; viz. either\r\nwithin the Staten Island, or without it. The inhabitants are determined\r\nin their choice by the weather; for when it is stormy and cloudy, or\r\ndark, they do not venture to sail without, where the sea itself\r\ncommunicates. We took that course now, it being very pleasant weather;\r\nand though we struck on the sands once or twice, yet we got loose\r\nagain, and arrived at New York about nine o’clock. Of this town I have\r\ngiven an account in the preceding volume [61].\r\n\r\nJune the 4th. I found vines in several gardens, got from the old\r\ncountries. They bear annually a quantity of excellent grapes. When the\r\nwinters are very severe, they are killed by the frost, and die quite to\r\nthe ground; but the next spring new shoots spring up from the root.\r\n\r\nStrawberries were now sold in abundance about the town every day. An\r\nEnglishman from Jamaica asserted, that in that island there were no\r\nstrawberries. The snakes are very fond of strawberries. Those which\r\nthey had here were not so good as the Swedish and Finland ones.\r\n\r\nRed Clover was sown in several places on the hills without the town.\r\nThe country people were now employed in mowing the meadows. Some were\r\nalready mown; and the dry clover was put under cover, in order to be\r\ncarried away the first opportunity.\r\n\r\nCherry-trees were planted in great quantities before the farm-houses,\r\nand along the high-roads, from Philadelphia to New Brunswick; but\r\nbehind that place they became more scarce. On coming to Staten Island,\r\nin the province of New York, I found them very common again, near the\r\ngardens. Here are not so many varieties of cherries as there are in\r\nPensylvania. I seldom saw any of the black sweet cherries [62] at New\r\nYork; but commonly the sour red ones. All travellers are allowed to\r\npluck ripe fruit in any garden which they pass by; and not even the\r\nmost covetous farmer can hinder them from so doing. Between New\r\nBrunswick and Staten Island, are a few cherry-gardens; but\r\nproportionably more orchards, with apple-trees.\r\n\r\nJune the 6th. Several gentlemen and merchants, between fifty and sixty\r\nyears of age, asserted, that during their life they had plainly found\r\nseveral kinds of fish decrease in number every year; and that they\r\ncould not get near so many fish now as they could formerly.\r\n\r\nRum, a brandy prepared from the sugar-canes, and in great use with all\r\nthe English North American colonies, is reckoned much wholesomer than\r\nbrandy, made from wine or corn [63]. In confirmation of this opinion,\r\nthey say, that if you put a piece of fresh meat into rum, and another\r\ninto brandy, and leave them there for some months; that in the rum will\r\nkeep as it was, but that in the brandy will be quite eaten, and full of\r\nholes. But this experiment does not seem a very accurate one to me.\r\nMajor Roderfort told me, that being upon the Canada expedition, he had\r\nobserved, that such of his men as drank brandy for some time died of\r\nit; but those who drank rum were not hurt, though they got drunk with\r\nit every day, and oftener than the others.\r\n\r\nLong-Island is the name of an island opposite the town of New York, in\r\nthe sea. The northern part of the island is much more fertile than the\r\nsouthern. Formerly there lived a number of Indians on this island; and\r\nthere are yet some, which however decrease in number every year,\r\nbecause they leave the island. The soil of the southern part of the\r\nisland is very poor; but this deficiency is made up by a vast quantity\r\nof oysters, lobsters, crabs, several kinds of fish, and numbers of\r\nwater fowl, all which are there far more abundant than on the northern\r\nshores of the Island. Therefore the Indians formerly chose the southern\r\npart to live in, because they subsisted on oysters, and other\r\nproductions of the sea. When the tide is out, it is very easy to fill a\r\nwhole cart with oysters, which have been driven on shore by one flood.\r\nThe Island is strewed with oystershells and other shells, which the\r\nIndians left there; these shells serve now for good manure for the\r\nfields. The southern part of the Island is turned into meadows, and the\r\nnorthern part into fields. The winter is more constant on the northern\r\npart, and the snow in spring lies longer there than on the southern\r\npart. The people are very fertile here, and commonly tall and strong.\r\n\r\nJune the 10th. At noon we left New York, and sailed up the river\r\nHudson, in a yacht bound for Albany. All this afternoon we saw a whole\r\nfleet of little boats returning from New York, whither they had brought\r\nprovisions and other goods for sale, which on account of the extensive\r\ncommerce of this town, and the great number of its inhabitants, go off\r\nvery well. The river Hudson runs from North to South here, except some\r\nhigh pieces of land which sometimes project far into it, and alter its\r\ndirection; its breadth at the mouth is reckoned about a mile and a\r\nquarter. Some porpesses played and tumbled in the river. The eastern\r\nshore, or the New York side, was at first very steep and high; but the\r\nwestern was very sloping and covered with woods. There appeared\r\nfarm-houses on both sides, surrounded with corn-fields. The ground of\r\nwhich the steep shores consisted was of a pale brick colour, and some\r\nlittle rocks of a grey sand-stone were seen here and there. About ten\r\nor twelve miles from New York, the western shore appears quite\r\ndifferent from what it was before; it consists of steep mountains with\r\nperpendicular sides towards the river, and they are exactly like the\r\nsteep sides of the mountains of Hall and Hunnebarg in West Gothland.\r\nSometimes a rock projects like the salliant angle of a bastion: the\r\ntops of these mountains are covered with oaks, and other wood; a number\r\nof stones of all sizes lay along the shore, having rolled down from the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nThese high and steep mountains continue for some English miles on the\r\nwestern shore; but on the eastern side the land is high, and sometimes\r\ndiversified with hills and valleys, which are commonly covered with\r\ndeciduous trees, amongst which there appears a farm now and then in a\r\nglade. The hills are covered with stones in some places. About twelve\r\nmiles from New York we saw Sturgeons [64] (Acipenser Sturio), leaping\r\nup out of the water, and on the whole passage we met with porpesses in\r\nthe river. As we proceeded we found the eastern banks of the river very\r\nmuch cultivated; and a number of pretty farms surrounded with orchards\r\nand fine corn-fields, presented themselves to our view. About\r\ntwenty-two miles from New York, the high mountains which I have before\r\nmentioned left us, and made as it were a high ridge here from east to\r\nwest quite across the country. This altered the face of the country on\r\nthe western shore of the river: from mountainous, it became\r\ninterspersed with little vallies and round hillocks, which were scarce\r\ninhabited at all; but the eastern shore continued to afford us a\r\ndelightful prospect. After sailing a little while in the night, we cast\r\nour anchor and lay here till the morning, especially as the tide was\r\nebbing with great force.\r\n\r\nJune the 11th. This morning we continued our voyage up the river, with\r\nthe tide and a faint breeze. We now passed the Highland mountains,\r\nwhich were to the East of us; they consist of a grey sandstone, are\r\nvery high and pretty steep, and covered with deciduous trees, and\r\nlikewise with firs and red cedars. The western shore was full of rocks,\r\nwhich however did not come up to the height of the mountains on the\r\nopposite shore; the tops of these eastern mountains were cut off from\r\nour sight by a thick fog which surrounded them. The country was unfit\r\nfor cultivation, being so full of rocks, and accordingly we saw no\r\nfarms. The distance from these mountains to New York is computed at\r\nthirty-six English miles.\r\n\r\nA thick fog now rose up from the high mountains. For the space of some\r\nEnglish miles, we had hills and rocks on the western banks of the\r\nriver; and a change of lesser and greater mountains and vallies covered\r\nwith young firs, red cedars, and oaks, on the eastern side. The hills\r\nclose to the river side are commonly low, but their height increases as\r\nthey are further from the river. Afterwards we saw, for some miles\r\ntogether, nothing but high round mountains and valleys, both covered\r\nwith woods; the valleys are in reality nothing but low rocks, and stand\r\nperpendicular towards the river in many places. The breadth of the\r\nriver is sometimes two or three musket shot, but commonly not above\r\none; every now and then we saw several kinds of fish leaping out of the\r\nwater. The wind vanished away about ten o’clock in the morning, and\r\nforced us to get forwards with our oars, the tide being almost spent.\r\nIn one place on the western shore we saw a wooden house painted red,\r\nand we were told, that there was a saw-mill further up; but besides\r\nthis we did not perceive one farm or any cultivated grounds all this\r\nforenoon.\r\n\r\nThe water in the river has here no more a brackish taste; yet I was\r\ntold that the tide, especially when the wind is South, sometimes\r\ncarries the salt water up higher with it. The colour of the water was\r\nlikewise altered, for it appeared darker here than before. To account\r\nfor the first origin of rivers is very difficult, if not wholly\r\nimpossible; some rivers may have come from a great reservoir of water,\r\nwhich being considerably encreased by heavy falls of rain or other\r\ncircumstances, passed its old bounds and flowed to the lower countries,\r\nthrough the places where it met with the least opposition. This is\r\nperhaps the reason why some rivers run in so many bendings equally\r\nthrough fields of soft earth, as likewise there, where mountains,\r\nrocks, and stones, divert their passage. However it seems that some\r\nrivers derive their first origin from the creation itself, and that\r\nProvidence then pointed out their course; for their existence can, in\r\nall probability, not be owing to the accidental eruption of water\r\nalone. Among these rivers we may rank the river Hudson: I was surprised\r\non seeing its course, and the variety of its shores. It takes its rise\r\na good way above Albany, and descends to New York, in a direct line\r\nfrom North to South, which is a distance of about a hundred and sixty\r\nEnglish miles, and perhaps more; for the little bendings which it makes\r\nare of no signification. In many places between New York and Albany,\r\nare ridges of high mountains running West and East. But it is\r\nremarkable that they go on undisturbed till they come to the river\r\nHudson, which cuts directly across them, and frequently their sides\r\nstand perpendicular towards the river. There is an opening left in the\r\nchain of mountains, as broad as the river commonly is, for it to pass\r\nthrough, and the mountains go on as before, on the other side, in the\r\nsame direction. It is likewise remarkable, that the river in such\r\nplaces where it passes through the mountains is as deep, and often\r\ndeeper than in the other places. The perpendicular rocks on the sides\r\nof the river are surprising, and it appears that if no passages had\r\nbeen opened by Providence, for the river to pass through, the mountains\r\nin the upper part of the country would have been inundated, since these\r\nmountains, like so many dykes, would have hindered the water from going\r\non. Quere, Why does this river go on in a direct line for so\r\nconsiderable a distance? Why do the many passages, through which the\r\nriver flows across the mountains, ly under the same meridian? Why are\r\nwater-falls near some of these passages, or at least shallow water with\r\na rocky ground?\r\n\r\nWe now perceived excessive high and steep mountains on both sides of\r\nthe river, which echoed back each sound we uttered. Yet notwithstanding\r\nthey were so high and steep, they were covered with small trees.\r\n\r\nThe Blue Mountains, which reared their towering tops above all the\r\nother mountains, were now seen before us, towards North, but at a great\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThe country began here to look more cultivated, and less mountainous.\r\n\r\nThe last of the high western mountains is called Butterhill, after\r\nwhich the country between the mountains grows more spacious. The farms\r\nbecame very numerous, and we had a prospect of many corn-fields,\r\nbetween the hills: before we passed these hills we had the wind in our\r\nface, and we could only get forward by tacking, which went very slow,\r\nas the river was hardly a musket-shot in breadth. Afterwards we cast\r\nanchor, because we had both wind and tide against us.\r\n\r\nWhilst we waited for the return of tide and the change of wind, we went\r\non shore.\r\n\r\nThe Sassafras-tree (Laurus Sassafras) and the chesnut-tree grows here\r\nin great abundance. I found the tulip-tree (Liriodendron tulipifera) in\r\nsome parts of the wood, as likewise the Kalmia latifolia, which was now\r\nin full blossom; though the flowers were already withering.\r\n\r\nSome time after noon the wind arose from South-west, which being a fair\r\nwind, we weighed anchor, and continued our voyage. The place where we\r\nlay at anchor, was just the end of those steep and amazing high\r\nmountains: their height is very amazing; they consist of grey rock\r\nstone, and close to them, on the shore, lay a vast number of little\r\nstones. As soon as we had passed these mountains, the country became\r\nclearer of mountains, and higher. The river likewise encreased in\r\nbreadth, so as to be near an English mile broad. After sailing for some\r\ntime, we found no more mountains along the river; but on the eastern\r\nside goes a high chain of mountains to the north-east, whose sides are\r\ncovered with woods, up to one half of their height. The summits however\r\nare quite barren; for I suppose that nothing would grow there, on\r\naccount of the great degree of heat [65], dryness, and the violence of\r\nthe wind, to which that part is exposed. The eastern side of the river\r\nis much more cultivated than the western, where we seldom saw a house,\r\nthe land being covered with woods, though it is in general very level.\r\nAbout fifty-six English miles from New York the country is not very\r\nhigh; yet it is every where covered with woods, except some new farms\r\nwhich were scattered here and there. The high mountains which we left\r\nin the afternoon, now appeared above the woods and the country. These\r\nmountains, which were called the Highlands, did not project more North\r\nthan the other, in the place where we anchored. Their sides (not those\r\ntowards the river) were seldom perpendicular, but sloping, so that one\r\ncould climb up to the top, though not without difficulty.\r\n\r\nOn several high grounds near the river, the people burnt lime. The\r\nmaster of the yacht told me, that they break a fine blueish grey\r\nlimestone in the high grounds, along both sides of the river, for the\r\nspace of some English miles, and burn lime of it. But at some miles\r\ndistance there is no more limestone, and they find also none on the\r\nbanks till they come to Albany.\r\n\r\nWe passed by a little neck of land, which projected on the western side\r\nin the river, and was called Dance. The name of this place is said to\r\nderive its origin from a festival which the Dutch celebrated here in\r\nformer times, and at which they danced and diverted themselves; but\r\nonce there came a number of Indians, who killed them all.\r\n\r\nWe cast anchor late at night, because the wind ceased and the tide was\r\nebbing. The depth of the river is twelve fathoms here.\r\n\r\nThe fire-flies passed the river in numbers, at night, and sometimes\r\nsettled upon the rigging.\r\n\r\nJune the 12th. This morning we proceeded with the tide, but against the\r\nwind. The river was here a musket-shot broad. The country in general is\r\nlow on both sides, consisting of low rocks, and stony fields, which are\r\nhowever covered with woods. It is so rocky, stony, and poor, that\r\nnobody can settle in it, or inhabit it, there being no spot of ground\r\nfit for a corn-field. The country continued to have the same appearance\r\nfor the space of some miles, and we never perceived one settlement. At\r\neleven o’clock this morning we came to a little island, which lies in\r\nthe middle of the river, and is said to be half-way between New York\r\nand Albany. The shores are still low, stony, and rocky, as before. But\r\nat a greater distance we saw high mountains, covered with woods,\r\nchiefly on the western shore, raising their tops above the rest of the\r\ncountry; and still further off, the Blue Mountains rose up above them.\r\nTowards noon it was quite calm, and we went on very slow. Here, the\r\nland is well cultivated, especially on the eastern shore, and full of\r\ngreat corn-fields; yet the soil seemed sandy. Several villages lay on\r\nthe eastern side, and one of them, called Strasburg, was inhabited by a\r\nnumber of Germans. To the West we saw several cultivated places. The\r\nBlue Mountains are very plainly to be seen here. They appear through\r\nthe clouds, and tower above all other mountains. The river is full an\r\nEnglish mile broad opposite Strasburg.\r\n\r\nThey make use of a yellow Agaricus, or mushroom, which grows on\r\nmaple-trees, for tinder; that which is found on the red-flowering maple\r\n(Acer rubrum) is reckoned the best, and next in goodness is that of the\r\nSugar-maple (Acer saccarinum), which is sometimes reckoned as good as\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\nRhinbeck is a place at some distance from Strasburg, further off from\r\nthe river. It is inhabited by many Germans, who have a church there.\r\nTheir clergyman at present was the Rev. Mr. Hartwig, who knew some\r\nSwedish, having been at Gothenburg for some time. This little town is\r\nnot visible from the river-side.\r\n\r\nAt two in the afternoon it began again to blow from the south, which\r\nenabled us to proceed. The country on the eastern side is high, and\r\nconsists of a well cultivated soil. We had fine corn-fields, pretty\r\nfarms, and good orchards, in view. The western shore is likewise\r\nsomewhat high, but still covered with woods, and we now and then,\r\nthough seldom, saw one or two little settlements. The river is above an\r\nEnglish mile broad in most places, and comes in a strait line from the\r\nNorth, so that we could not sometimes follow it with our eye.\r\n\r\nJune the 13th. The wind favoured our voyage during the whole night, so\r\nthat I had no opportunity of observing the nature of the country. This\r\nmorning at five o’clock we were but nine English miles from Albany. The\r\ncountry on both sides the river is low, and covered with woods,\r\nexcepting a few little scattered settlements. Under the higher shores\r\nof the river are wet meadows, covered with sword-grass (Carex), and\r\nthey formed several little islands. We saw no mountains; and hastened\r\ntowards Albany. The land on both sides of the river is chiefly low, and\r\nmore carefully cultivated as we came nearer to Albany.\r\n\r\nAs to the houses, which we saw, some were of wood, others of stone. The\r\nriver is seldom above a musket-shot broad, and in several parts of it\r\nare sands, which require great experience for governing the yachts. At\r\neight o’clock in the morning we arrived at Albany.\r\n\r\nAll the yachts which ply between Albany and New York, belong to Albany.\r\nThey go up and down the river Hudson, as long as it is open and free\r\nfrom ice. They bring from Albany boards or planks, and all sorts of\r\ntimber, flour, pease, and furs, which they get from the Indians, or\r\nwhich are smuggled from the French. They come home almost empty, and\r\nonly bring a few merchandizes with them, among which rum is the chief.\r\nThis last is absolutely necessary to the inhabitants of Albany; they\r\ncheat the Indians in the fur trade with it; for when the Indians are\r\ndrunk, they will leave it to the Albanians to fix the price of the\r\nfurs. The yachts are pretty large, and have a good cabbin, in which the\r\npassengers can be very commodiously lodged. They are commonly built of\r\nred Cedar, or of white Oak. Frequently, the bottom consists of white\r\noak, and the sides of red cedar, because the latter withstands\r\nputrefaction much longer than the former. The red cedar is likewise apt\r\nto split, when it hits against any thing, and the river Hudson is in\r\nmany parts full of sands and rocks, against which the keel of the yacht\r\nsometimes hits; therefore they choose white oak for the bottom, as\r\nbeing the softer wood, and not splitting so easily: and the bottom\r\nbeing continually under water, is not so much exposed to putrefaction,\r\nand holds out longer.\r\n\r\nThe Canoes which the yachts have along with them, are made of a single\r\npiece of wood, hollowed out; they are sharp on both ends, frequently\r\nthree or four fathoms long, and as broad as the thickness of the wood\r\nwill allow. The people in it do not row sitting, but commonly a fellow\r\nstands at each end, with a short oar in his hand, with which he governs\r\nand brings the canoe forwards. Those which are made here at Albany, are\r\ncommonly of the white Pine; they can do service for eight or twelve\r\nyears, especially if they be tarred and painted. At Albany they make\r\nthem of the white pine, since there is no other wood fit for them; at\r\nNew York they are made of the tulip-tree, and in other parts they are\r\nmade of red or white cedars: but both these trees are so small, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Albany, that they are unfit for canoes; there are no\r\nseats in the canoes, for if they had any, they would be more liable to\r\nbe overset, as one could not keep the equilibrium so well.\r\n\r\nBattoes [66] are another kind of boats, which are much in use in\r\nAlbany: they are made of boards of white pine; the bottom is flat, that\r\nthey may row the better in shallow water; they are sharp at both ends,\r\nand somewhat higher towards the end than in the middle. They have seats\r\nin them, and are rowed as common boats. They are long, yet not all\r\nalike, commonly three, and sometimes four fathoms long. The height from\r\nthe bottom to the top of the board (for the sides stand almost\r\nperpendicular) is from twenty inches to two feet, and the breadth in\r\nthe middle about a yard and six inches. They are chiefly made use of\r\nfor carrying goods, by means of the rivers, to the Indians; that is,\r\nwhen those rivers are open enough for the battoes to pass through, and\r\nwhen they need not be carried by land a great way. The boats made of\r\nthe bark of trees, break easily by knocking against a stone, and the\r\ncanoes cannot carry a great cargo, and are easily overset; the battoes\r\nare therefore preferable to them both. I saw no boats here like those\r\nin Sweden, and other parts of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe frost does frequently a great deal of damage at Albany. There is\r\nhardly a month in summer during which a frost does not happen. The\r\nspring comes very late, and in April and May are numerous cold nights,\r\nwhich frequently kill the flowers of trees and kitchen-herbs. It was\r\nfeared that the blossoms of the apple-trees had been so severely\r\ndamaged by the frost, last May, that next autumn there would be but\r\nvery few apples. The oak-blossoms are very often killed by the frost in\r\nthe woods. The autumn here is of long continuance, with warm days and\r\nnights. However, the cold nights commonly commence towards the end of\r\nSeptember, and are frequent in October. The people are forced to keep\r\ntheir cattle in stables, from the middle of November, till March or\r\nApril, and must find them hay during that time [67].\r\n\r\nDuring summer, the wind blows commonly from the South, and brings a\r\ngreat drought along with it. Sometimes it rains a little, and as soon\r\nas it has rained the wind veers to North West, blowing for several days\r\nfrom that point, and then returning to the South. I have had frequent\r\nopportunities of seeing this change of wind happen very exactly, both\r\nthis year and the following.\r\n\r\nJune the 15th. The enclosures were made of boards of fir-wood, of which\r\nthere is abundance in the extensive woods, and many saw-mills to cut it\r\ninto boards.\r\n\r\nThe several sorts of apple-trees grow very well here, and bear as fine\r\nfruit as in any other part of North America. Each farm has a large\r\norchard. They have some apples here, which are very large, and very\r\npalatable; they are sent to New York, and other places as a rarity.\r\nThey make excellent cyder, in autumn, in the country round Albany.\r\n\r\nAll the kinds of cherry-trees, which have been planted here, succeed\r\nvery well.\r\n\r\nPear-trees do not succeed here. This was complained of in many other\r\nparts of North America. But I fear that they do not take sufficient\r\ncare in the management and planting of them; for I have seen fine pears\r\nin several parts of North America.\r\n\r\nPeach-trees have often been planted here, and never would succeed well.\r\nThis was attributed to a worm which lives in the ground, and eats\r\nthrough the root, so that the tree dies. Perhaps the severity of the\r\nwinter contributes much to it.\r\n\r\nThey plant no other fruit-trees at Albany besides these I have\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThey sow as much hemp and flax here, as they want for home consumption.\r\n\r\nThey sow maize in great abundance: A loose soil is reckoned the best\r\nfor this purpose; for it will not grow in clay. From half a bushel they\r\nreap a hundred bushels. They reckon maize a very good kind of corn,\r\nbecause the shoot recovers after being hurt by the frost. They have had\r\nexamples here of the shoots dying twice in spring, to the very ground,\r\nand yet they shot up again afterwards, and afforded an excellent crop.\r\nMaize has likewise the advantage of standing much longer against a\r\ndrought, than wheat. The larger sort of maize which is commonly sown\r\nhere, ripens in September.\r\n\r\nThey sow wheat in the neighbourhood of Albany, with great advantage.\r\nFrom one bushel they get twelve sometimes; if the soil be good, they\r\nget twenty bushels. If their crop amounts only to ten bushels from one,\r\nthey think it very trifling. The inhabitants of the country round\r\nAlbany, are Dutch and Germans. The Germans live in several great\r\nvillages, and sow great quantities of wheat, which is brought to\r\nAlbany; and from thence they send many yachts laden with flour to New\r\nYork. The wheat-flour from Albany is reckoned the best in all North\r\nAmerica, except that from Sopus or King’s Town, a place between Albany\r\nand New York. All the bread in Albany is made of wheat. At New York\r\nthey pay the Albany flour with several Shillings more per hundred\r\nweight, than that from other places.\r\n\r\nRye is likewise sown here, but not so generally as wheat.\r\n\r\nThey do not sow much barley here, because they do not reckon the\r\nprofits very great. Wheat is so plentiful that they make malt of it. In\r\nthe neighbourhood of New York, I saw great fields sown with barley.\r\n\r\nThey do not sow more oats than are necessary for their horses.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch and Germans who live hereabouts, sow pease in great\r\nabundance; they succeed very well, and are annually carried to New\r\nYork, in great quantities. They have been free from insects for a\r\nconsiderable time. But of late years the same beetles which destroy the\r\npease in Pensylvania, New Jersey, and the lower parts of the province\r\nof New York [68], have likewise appeared abundant among the pease here.\r\nIt is a real loss to this town, and to the other parts of North\r\nAmerica, which used to get pease from hence for their own consumption,\r\nand that of their sailors. It had been found that if they procured good\r\npease from Albany, and sowed them near King’s Town, or the lower part\r\nof the province of New York, they succeeded very well the first year,\r\nbut were so full of worms the second, and following years, that nobody\r\ncould or would eat them. Some people put ashes into the pot, among the\r\npease, when they will not boil, or soften well; but whether this is\r\nwholesome and agreeable to the palate, I do not know.\r\n\r\nPotatoes are generally planted. Some people preferred ashes to sand for\r\nkeeping them in during winter.\r\n\r\nThe Bermuda Potatoes (Convolvulus Batatas) have likewise been planted\r\nhere, and succeed pretty well. The greatest difficulty is to keep them\r\nduring winter; for they generally rot in that season.\r\n\r\nThe Humming-bird (Trochilus Colubris) comes to this place sometimes;\r\nbut is rather a scarce bird.\r\n\r\nThe shingles with which the houses are covered are made of the White\r\nPine, which is reckoned as good and as durable, and sometimes better,\r\nthan the White Cedar (Cupressus thyoides). The White Pine is found\r\nabundant here, in such places where common pines grow in Europe, I have\r\nnever seen them in the lower parts of the province of New York, nor in\r\nNew Jersey and Pensylvania. They saw a vast quantity of deal from the\r\nWhite Pine on this side of Albany, which are brought down to New York,\r\nand from thence exported.\r\n\r\nThe woods abound with vines, which likewise grow on the steep banks of\r\nthe river in surprising quantities. They climbed to the tops of trees\r\non the bank, and bent them by their weight. But where they found no\r\ntrees, they hung down along the steep shores, and covered them\r\nentirely. The grapes are eaten after the frost has attacked them; for\r\nthey are too sour before. They are not much used any other way.\r\n\r\nThe vast woods and uninhabited grounds, between Albany and Canada,\r\ncontain immense swarms of gnats, which annoy the travellers. To be in\r\nsome measure secured against these insects, some besmear their face\r\nwith butter or grease; for the gnats do not like to settle on greasy\r\nplaces. The great heat makes boots very uneasy; but to prevent the\r\ngnats from stinging the legs, they wrap some paper round them, under\r\nthe stockings. Some travellers wear caps which cover the whole face,\r\nand have some gauze before the eyes. At night they lie in tents, if\r\nthey can carry any with them; and make a great fire at the entrance, by\r\nthe smoke of which the gnats are driven away.\r\n\r\nThe porpesses seldom go higher up the river Hudson than the salt water\r\ngoes; after that, the sturgeons fill their place. It has however\r\nsometimes happened, that porpesses have gone quite up to Albany.\r\n\r\nThere is a report, that a whale once came up the river quite to this\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nThe Fireflies (Lampyris) which are the same that are so common in\r\nPensylvania during summer, are seen here in abundance every night. They\r\nfly up and down in the streets of this town. They come into, the\r\nhouses, if the doors and windows are open.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the Pensylvanian trees are not to be met with in these\r\nwoods; viz.\r\n\r\nMagnolia glauca, the Beaver-tree.\r\n\r\nNyssa aquatica, the Tupelo-tree.\r\n\r\nLiquidambar styraciflua, the Sweet-gum tree.\r\n\r\nDiospyros Virginiana, the Persimon.\r\n\r\nLiriodendron tulipifera, the Tulip-tree.\r\n\r\nJuglans nigra, the black Walnut-tree.\r\n\r\nQuercus ——, the Swamp Oak.\r\n\r\nCercis Canadensis, the Sallad-tree.\r\n\r\nRobinia pseudacacia, the Locust-tree.\r\n\r\nGleditsia triacanthos, the Honey-locust tree.\r\n\r\nAnnona muricata, the Papaw-tree.\r\n\r\nCeltis occidentalis, the Nettle-tree. And a number of shrubs, which are\r\nnever found here.\r\n\r\nThe more northerly situation of the place, the height of the Blue\r\nMountains, and the course of the rivers, which flow here southward into\r\nthe sea, and accordingly carry the seeds of plants from north to south,\r\nand not the contrary way, are chiefly the causes that several plants\r\nwhich grow in Pensylvania cannot be found here.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon I went to see an island which lies in the middle of the\r\nriver, about a mile below the town. This island is an English mile\r\nlong, and not above a quarter of a mile broad. It is almost entirely\r\nturned into corn-fields; and is inhabited by a single planter, who,\r\nbesides possessing this island, is the owner of two more. Here we saw\r\nno woods, except a few trees which were left round the island on the\r\nshore, and formed as it were a tall and great hedge. The Red Maple\r\n(Acer rubrum) grows in abundance in several places. Its leaves are\r\nwhite or silvery on the under sides, and, when agitated by the wind,\r\nthey make the tree appear as if it was full of white flowers. The\r\nWater-beech (Platanus occidentalis) grows to a great height, and is one\r\nof the most shady trees here. The Water-poplar [69] is the most common\r\ntree hereabouts, grows exceedingly well on the shores of the river, and\r\nis as tall as the tallest of our asps. In summer it affords the best\r\nshade for men and cattle against the scorching heat. On the banks of\r\nrivers and lakes it is one of the most useful trees, because it holds\r\nthe soil by its extensive branched roots, and prevents the water from\r\nwashing it away. The Water-beech and the Elm-tree (Ulmus) serve the\r\nsame purpose. The wild Prune-trees were plentiful here, and were full\r\nof unripe fruit. Its wood is not made use of; but its fruit is eaten.\r\nSumach (Rhus glabra) is plentiful here; as also the wild vines, which\r\nclimb up the trees, and creep along the high shores of the river. I was\r\ntold, that the grapes ripen very late, though they were already pretty\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\nThe American Elm-tree (Ulmus Americana) formed several high hedges. The\r\nsoil of this island is a rich mould, mixed with sand, which is chiefly\r\nemployed in maize plantations. There were likewise large fields of\r\npotatoes. The whole island was leased for one hundred pounds of New\r\nYork currency. The person who had taken the lease, again let some\r\ngreater and some smaller lots of ground, to the inhabitants of Albany,\r\nfor making kitchen-gardens of; and by that means reimbursed himself.\r\nPortulack (Portulaca oleracea) grows spontaneously here in great\r\nabundance, and looks very well.\r\n\r\nJune the 20th. The tide in the river Hudson goes about eight or ten\r\nEnglish miles above Albany, and consequently runs one hundred and\r\nfifty-six English miles from the sea. In spring, when the snow melts,\r\nthere is hardly any flowing near this town; for the great quantity of\r\nwater which comes from the mountains during that season, occasions a\r\ncontinual ebbing. This likewise happens after heavy rains.\r\n\r\nThe cold is generally reckoned very severe here. The ice in the river\r\nHudson is commonly three or four feet thick. On the 3d of April some of\r\nthe inhabitants crossed the river with six pair of horses. The ice\r\ncommonly dissolves about the end of March, or beginning of April. Great\r\npieces of ice come down about that time, which sometimes carry with\r\nthem the houses that stand close to the shore. The water is very high\r\nat that time in the river, because the ice stops sometimes, and sticks\r\nin places where the river is narrow. The water has been often observed\r\nto rise three fathom higher than it commonly is in summer. The ground\r\nis frozen here in winter to the depth of three, four, or five feet. On\r\nthe 16th of November the yachts are put up, and about the beginning or\r\nmiddle of April they are in motion again. They are unacquainted with\r\nstoves; and their chimnies are so wide that one could drive through\r\nthem with a cart and horses.\r\n\r\nThe water of several wells in this town was very cool about this time;\r\nbut had a kind of acid taste, which was not very agreeable. On a nearer\r\nexamination, I found an abundance of little insects in it, which were\r\nprobably Monoculi. Their length was different; some were a geometrical\r\nline and an half, others two, and others four lines long. They were\r\nvery narrow, and of a pale colour. The head was blacker and thicker\r\nthan the other parts of the body, and about the size of a pin’s head.\r\nThe tail was divided into two branches, and each branch terminated in a\r\nlittle black globule. When these insects swim, they proceed in crooked\r\nor undulated lines, almost like Tadpoles. I poured some of this water\r\ninto a bowl, and put near a fourth part of rum to it. The Monoculi,\r\ninstead of being affected with it, swam about as briskly as they had\r\ndone in the water. This shews, that if one makes punch with this water,\r\nit must be very strong to kill the Monoculi. I think this water is not\r\nvery wholesome for people who are not used to it, though the\r\ninhabitants of Albany, who drink it every day, say, they do not feel\r\nthe least inconvenience from it. I have been several times obliged to\r\ndrink water here, in which I have plainly seen Monoculi swimming; but I\r\ngenerally felt the next day somewhat like a pea in my throat, or as if\r\nI had a swelling there; and this continued for above a week. I felt\r\nsuch swellings this year, both at Albany and in other parts. My\r\nservant, Yungstroem, likewise got a great pain in his breast, and a\r\nsensation as from a swelling, after drinking water with Monoculi in it:\r\nbut whether these insects occasioned it, or whether it came from some\r\nother cause, I cannot ascertain. However, I have always endeavoured, as\r\nmuch as possible, to do without such water as had Monoculi in it. I\r\nhave found Monoculi in very cold water, taken from the deepest wells,\r\nin different parts of this country. Perhaps many of our diseases arise\r\nfrom waters of this kind, which we do not sufficiently examine. I have\r\nfrequently observed abundance of minute insects in water, which has\r\nbeen remarkable for its clearness. Almost each house in Albany has its\r\nwell, the water of which is applied to common use; but for tea,\r\nbrewing, and washing, they commonly take the water of the river Hudson,\r\nwhich flows close by the town. This water is generally quite muddy, and\r\nvery warm in summer; and, on that account, it is kept in cellars, in\r\norder that the slime may subside, and that the water may cool a little.\r\n\r\nWe lodged with a gunsmith, who told us, that the best charcoals for the\r\nforge were made of the Black Pine. The next in goodness, in his\r\nopinion, were charcoals, made of the Beech-tree.\r\n\r\nThe best and dearest stocks for his muskets were made of the wood of\r\nthe wild Cherry-tree; and next to these he valued those of the Red\r\nMaple most. They scarce make use of any other wood for this purpose.\r\nThe black Walnut-tree affords excellent wood for stocks; but it does\r\nnot grow in the neighbourhood of Albany.\r\n\r\nJune the 21st. Next to the town of New York, Albany is the principal\r\ntown, or at least the most wealthy, in the province of New York. It is\r\nsituated on the declivity of a hill, close to the western shore of the\r\nriver Hudson, about one hundred and forty-six English miles from New\r\nYork. The town extends along the river, which flows here from N. N. E.\r\nto S. S. W. The high mountains in the west, above the town, bound the\r\nprospect on that side. There are two churches in Albany, an English one\r\nand a Dutch one. The Dutch church stands at some distance from the\r\nriver, on the east side of the market. It is built of stone; and in the\r\nmiddle it has a small steeple, with a bell. It has but one minister,\r\nwho preaches twice every Sunday. The English church is situated on the\r\nhill, at the west end of the market, directly under the fort. It is\r\nlikewise built of stone, but has no steeple. There was no service at\r\nthis church at this time, because they had no minister; and all the\r\npeople understood Dutch, the garrison excepted. The minister of this\r\nchurch has a settled income of one hundred pounds sterling, which he\r\ngets from England. The town-hall lies to the southward of the Dutch\r\nchurch, close by the river side. It is a fine building of stone, three\r\nstories high. It has a small tower or steeple, with a bell, and a gilt\r\nball and vane at the top of it.\r\n\r\nThe houses in this town are very neat, and partly built with stones\r\ncovered with shingles of the White Pine. Some are slated with tiles\r\nfrom Holland, because the clay of this neighbourhood is not reckoned\r\nfit for tiles. Most of the houses are built in the old way, with the\r\ngable-end towards the street; a few excepted, which were lately built\r\nin the manner now used. A great number of houses were built like those\r\nof New Brunswick, which I have described [70]; the gable-end being\r\nbuilt, towards the street, of bricks, and all the other walls of\r\nplanks. The outside of the houses is never covered with lime or mortar,\r\nnor have I seen it practiced in any North-American towns which I have\r\nvisited; and the walls do not seem to be damaged by the air. The\r\ngutters on the roofs reach almost to the middle of the street. This\r\npreserves the walls from being damaged by the rain; but is extremely\r\ndisagreeable in rainy weather for the people in the streets, there\r\nbeing hardly any means of avoiding the water from the gutters. The\r\nstreet-doors are generally in the middle of the houses; and on both\r\nsides are seats, on which, during fair weather, the people spend almost\r\nthe whole day, especially on those which are in the shadow of the\r\nhouses. In the evening these seats are covered with people of both\r\nsexes; but this is rather troublesome, as those who pass by are obliged\r\nto greet every body, unless they will shock the politeness of the\r\ninhabitants of this town. The streets are broad, and some of them are\r\npaved; in some parts they are lined with trees; the long streets are\r\nalmost parallel to the river, and the others intersect them at right\r\nangles. The street which goes between the two churches, is five times\r\nbroader than the others, and serves as a market-place. The streets upon\r\nthe whole are very dirty, because the people leave their cattle in\r\nthem, during the summer nights. There are two market-places in the\r\ntown, to which the country people resort twice a week.\r\n\r\nThe fort lies higher than any other building, on a high steep hill on\r\nthe West side of the town. It is a great building of stone, surrounded\r\nwith high and thick walls; its situation is very bad, as it can only\r\nserve to keep off plundering parties, without being able to sustain a\r\nsiege. There are numerous high hills to the west of the fort, which\r\ncommand it, and from whence one may see all that is done within it.\r\nThere is commonly an officer and a number of soldiers quartered in it.\r\nThey say the fort contains a spring of water.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Albany is very advantageous in regard to trade. The\r\nriver Hudson, which flows close by it, is from twelve to twenty feet\r\ndeep. There is not yet any quay made for the better lading of the\r\nyachts, because the people feared it would suffer greatly, or be\r\nentirely carried away in spring by the ice, which then comes down the\r\nriver; the vessels which are in use here, may come pretty near the\r\nshore in order to be laden, and heavy goods are brought to them upon\r\ncanoes tied together. Albany carries on a considerable commerce with\r\nNew York, chiefly in furs, boards, wheat, flour, pease, several kinds\r\nof timber, &c. There is not a place in all the British colonies, the\r\nHudson’s Bay settlements excepted, where such quantities of furs and\r\nskins are bought of the Indians, as at Albany. Most of the merchants in\r\nthis town send a clerk or agent to Oswego, an English trading town upon\r\nthe lake Ontario, to which the Indians resort with their furs. I intend\r\nto give a more minute account of this place in my Journal for the year\r\n1750. The merchants from Albany spend the whole summer at Oswego, and\r\ntrade with many tribes of Indians who come to them with their goods.\r\nMany people have assured me, that the Indians are frequently cheated in\r\ndisposing of their goods, especially when they are in liquor, and that\r\nsometimes they do not get one half or even one tenth of the value of\r\ntheir goods. I have been a witness to several transactions of this\r\nkind. The merchants of Albany glory in these tricks, and are highly\r\npleased when they have given a poor Indian a greater portion of brandy\r\nthan he can bear, and when they can after that get all his goods for\r\nmere trifles. The Indians often find when they are sober again, that\r\nthey have been cheated, they grumble somewhat, but are soon satisfied\r\nwhen they reflect that they have for once drank as much as they are\r\nable, of a liquor which they value beyond any thing else in the whole\r\nworld, and they are quite insensible to their loss, if they again get a\r\ndraught of this nectar. Besides this trade at Oswego, a number of\r\nIndians come to Albany from several parts, especially from Canada; but\r\nfrom this latter place, they hardly bring any thing but beaver-skins.\r\nThere is a great penalty in Canada for carrying furs to the English,\r\nthat trade belonging to the French West India Company; notwithstanding\r\nwhich the French merchants in Canada carry on a considerable smuggling\r\ntrade. They send their furs, by means of the Indians, to their\r\ncorrespondents at Albany, who purchase it at the price which they have\r\nfixed upon with the French merchants. The Indians take in return\r\nseveral kinds of cloth, and other goods, which may be got here at a\r\nlower rate than those which are sent to Canada from France.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the merchants at Albany have extensive estates in\r\nthe country, and a great deal of wood. If their estates have a little\r\nbrook, they do not fail to erect a saw-mill upon it for sawing boards\r\nand planks, with which commodity many yachts go during the whole summer\r\nto New York, having scarce any other lading than boards.\r\n\r\nMany people at Albany make the wampum of the Indians, which is their\r\nornament and their money, by grinding some kinds of shells and muscles;\r\nthis is a considerable profit to the inhabitants. I shall speak of this\r\nkind of money in the sequel. The extensive trade which the inhabitants\r\nof Albany carry on, and their sparing manner of life, in the Dutch way,\r\ncontribute to the considerable wealth which many of them acquire.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Albany and its environs are almost all Dutchmen.\r\nThey speak Dutch, have Dutch preachers, and divine service is performed\r\nin that language: their manners are likewise quite Dutch; their dress\r\nis however like that of the English. It is well known that the first\r\nEuropeans who settled in the province of New York were Dutchmen. During\r\nthe time that they were the masters of this province, they possessed\r\nthemselves of New Sweden [71], of which they were jealous. However the\r\npleasure of possessing this conquered land and their own, was but of\r\nshort duration; for towards the end of 1664, Sir Robert Carre, by order\r\nof King Charles the second, went to New York, then New Amsterdam, and\r\ntook it. Soon after Colonel Nichols went to Albany, which then bore the\r\nname of Fort Orange, and upon taking it, named it Albany, from the Duke\r\nof York’s Scotch title. The Dutch inhabitants were allowed either to\r\ncontinue where they were, and, under the protection of the English, to\r\nenjoy all their former privileges, or to leave the country. The greater\r\npart of them chose to stay, and from them the Dutchmen are descended,\r\nwho now live in the province of New York, and who possess the greatest\r\nand best estates in that province.\r\n\r\nThe avarice and selfishness of the inhabitants of Albany are very well\r\nknown throughout all North America, by the English, by the French, and\r\neven by the Dutch, in the lower part of New York province. If a Jew,\r\nwho understands the art of getting forward perfectly well, should\r\nsettle amongst them, they would not fail to ruin him. For this reason\r\nnobody comes to this place without the most pressing necessity; and\r\ntherefore I was asked in several places, what induced me to go to it,\r\ntwo years one after another. I likewise found that the judgment, which\r\npeople formed of them, was not without foundation. For though they\r\nseldom see any strangers, (except those who go from the British\r\ncolonies to Canada and back again) and one might therefore expect to\r\nfind victuals and accommodation for travellers cheaper than in places,\r\nwhere travellers always resort to; yet I experienced the contrary. I\r\nwas here obliged to pay for every thing twice, thrice, and four times\r\nas dear as in any part of North America which I have passed through. If\r\nI wanted their assistance, I was obliged to pay them very well for it,\r\nand when I wanted to purchase any thing, or to be helped in some case\r\nor other, I could presently see what kind of blood ran in their veins;\r\nfor they either fixed exorbitant prices for their services, or were\r\nvery backward to assist me. Such was this people in general. However,\r\nthere were some amongst them who equalled any in North America, or any\r\nwhere else, in politeness, equity, goodness, and readiness to serve and\r\nto oblige; but their number fell far short of that of the former. If I\r\nmay be allowed to declare my conjectures, the origin of the inhabitants\r\nof Albany and its neighbourhood seems to me to be as follows. Whilst\r\nthe Dutch possessed this country, and intended to people it, the\r\ngovernment took up a pack of vagabonds, of which they intended to clear\r\nthe country, and sent them along with a number of other settlers to\r\nthis province. The vagabonds were sent far from the other colonists,\r\nupon the borders towards the Indians and other enemies, and a few\r\nhonest families were persuaded to go with them, in order to keep them\r\nin bounds. I cannot any other way account for the difference between\r\nthe inhabitants of Albany, and the other descendants of so respectable\r\na nation as the Dutch, who are settled in the lower part of New York\r\nprovince. The latter are civil, obliging, just in the prices, and\r\nsincere; and though they are not ceremonious, yet they are well meaning\r\nand honest, and their promises are to be relied on.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of the inhabitants of Albany, during the war between\r\nEngland and France, which was ended with the peace of Aix la Chapelle,\r\nhas, among several other causes, contributed to make them the object of\r\nhatred in all the British colonies, but more especially in New England.\r\nFor at the beginning of that war, when the Indians of both parties had\r\nreceived orders to commence hostilities, the French engaged theirs to\r\nattack the inhabitants of New England; which they faithfully executed,\r\nkilling every body they met with, and carrying off whatever they found.\r\nDuring this time the people of Albany remained neutral, and carried on\r\na great trade with the very Indians who murdered the inhabitants of New\r\nEngland. The plate, such as silver spoons, bowls, cups, &c. of which\r\nthe Indians robbed the houses in New England, was carried to Albany,\r\nfor sale. The people of that town bought up these silver vessels,\r\nthough the names of the owners were graved on many of them, and\r\nencouraged the Indians to get more of them, promising to pay them well,\r\nand whatever they would demand. This was afterwards interpreted by the\r\ninhabitants of New England, as if the Albanians encouraged the Indians\r\nto kill more of the people, who were in a manner their brothers, and\r\nwho were subjects of the same crown. Upon the first news of this\r\nbehaviour, which the Indians themselves spread in New England, the\r\ninhabitants of the latter province were greatly incensed, and\r\nthreatened, that the first step they would take in another war, would\r\nbe to burn Albany, and the adjacent parts. In the present war it will\r\nsufficiently appear how backward the other British provinces in America\r\nare in assisting Albany, and the neighbouring places, in case of an\r\nattack from the French or Indians [72]. The hatred which the English\r\nbear against the people, at Albany, is very great, but that of the\r\nAlbanians against the English is carried to a ten times higher degree.\r\nThis hatred has subsisted ever since the time when the English\r\nconquered this country, and is not yet extinguished, though they could\r\nnever have got such advantages under the Dutch government, as they have\r\nobtained under that of the English. For in a manner, their privileges\r\nare greater than those of Englishmen.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Albany are much more sparing than the English. The\r\nmeat which is served up is often insufficient to satisfy the stomach,\r\nand the bowl does not circulate so freely as amongst the English. The\r\nwomen are perfectly well acquainted with œconomy; they rise early, go\r\nto sleep very late, and are almost over nice and cleanly, in regard to\r\nthe floor, which is frequently scoured several times in the week. The\r\nservants in the town are chiefly negroes. Some of the inhabitants wear\r\ntheir own hair, but it is very short, without a bag or queue, which are\r\nlooked upon as the characteristics of Frenchmen; and as I wore my hair\r\nin a bag the first day I came here from Canada, I was surrounded with\r\nchildren, who called me Frenchman, and some of the boldest offered to\r\npull at my French dress.\r\n\r\nTheir meat, and manner of dressing it, is very different from that of\r\nthe English. Their breakfast is tea, commonly without milk. About\r\nthirty or forty years ago, tea was unknown to them, and they\r\nbreakfasted either upon bread and butter, or bread and milk. They never\r\nput sugar into the cup, but take a small bit of it into their mouths\r\nwhilst they drink. Along with the tea they eat bread and butter, with\r\nslices of hung beef. Coffee is not usual here; they breakfast generally\r\nabout seven. Their dinner is butter-milk, and bread, to which they\r\nsometimes add sugar, then it is a delicious dish for them; or fresh\r\nmilk and bread; or boiled or roasted flesh. They sometimes make use of\r\nbutter-milk instead of fresh milk, to boil a thin kind of porridge\r\nwith, which tastes very sour, but not disagreeable in hot weather. To\r\neach dinner they have a great sallad, prepared with abundance of\r\nvinegar, and very little or no oil. They frequently eat butter-milk,\r\nbread, and sallad, one mouthful after another. Their supper is\r\ngenerally bread and butter, and milk and bread. They sometimes eat\r\ncheese at breakfast, and at dinner; it is not in slices, but scraped or\r\nrasped, so as to resemble coarse flour, which they pretend adds to the\r\ngood taste of cheese. They commonly drink very small beer, or pure\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe governor of New York often confers at Albany, with the Indians of\r\nthe Five Nations, or the Iroquese, (Mohawks, Senekas, Cayugaws,\r\nOnondagoes, and Onidoes) especially when they intend either to make war\r\nupon, or to continue a war against the French. Sometimes their\r\ndeliberations likewise turn upon their conversion to the christian\r\nreligion, and it appears by the answer of one of the Indian chiefs, or\r\nSachems, to governor Hunter, at a conference in this town, that the\r\nEnglish do not pay so much attention to a work of so much consequence,\r\nas the French do, and that they do not send such able men to instruct\r\nthe Indians, as they ought to do [73]. For after governor Hunter had\r\npresented these Indians, by order of Queen Anne, with many clothes, and\r\nother presents, of which they were fond, he intended to convince them\r\nstill more of her Majesty’s good-will, and care for them, by adding,\r\nthat their good mother, the Queen, had not only generously provided\r\nthem with fine clothes for their bodies, but likewise intended to adorn\r\ntheir souls, by the preaching of the gospel; and that to this purpose\r\nsome ministers should be sent to them, to instruct them. The governor\r\nhad scarce ended, when one of the oldest Sachems got up, and answered,\r\nthat in the name of all the Indians, he thanked their gracious good\r\nqueen and mother for the fine clothes she had sent them; but that in\r\nregard to the ministers, they had already had some among them, (whom he\r\nlikewise named) who instead of preaching the holy gospel to them, had\r\ntaught them to drink to excess, to cheat, and to quarrel among\r\nthemselves. He then entreated the governor to take from them these\r\npreachers, and a number of Europeans who resided amongst them; for\r\nbefore they were come among them, the Indians had been an honest,\r\nsober, and innocent people, but most of them became rogues now. That\r\nthey had formerly had the fear of God, but that they hardly believed\r\nhis existence at present. That if he (the governor) would do them any\r\nfavour, he should send two or three blacksmiths amongst them, to teach\r\nthem to forge iron, in which they were unexperienced. The governor\r\ncould not forbear laughing at this extraordinary speech. I think the\r\nwords of St. Paul not wholly unapplicable on this occasion: For the\r\nname of God is blasphemed amongst the Gentiles, through you [74].\r\n\r\nJune the 21st. About five o’clock in the afternoon we left Albany, and\r\nproceeded towards Canada. We had two men with us, who were to accompany\r\nus to the first French place, which is Fort St. Frederick, or, as the\r\nEnglish call it, Crown Point. For this service each of them was to\r\nreceive five pounds of New York currency, besides which I was to\r\nprovide them with victuals. This is the common price here, and he that\r\ndoes not choose to conform to it, is obliged to travel alone. We were\r\nforced to take up with a canoe [75], as we could get neither battoes,\r\nnor boats of bark; and as there was a good road along the west side of\r\nthe river Hudson, we left the men to row forwards, in the canoe, and we\r\nwent along it on the shore, that we might be better able to examine it,\r\nand its curiosities, with greater accuracy. It is very incommodious to\r\nrow in these canoes; for one stands at each end and pushes the boat\r\nforwards. They commonly keep close to the shore, that they may be able\r\nto reach the ground easily. Thus the rowers are forced to stand\r\nupright, whilst they row in a canoe. We kept along the shore all the\r\nevening, towards the river, it consisted of great hills, and next to\r\nthe water grew the trees, which I have above mentioned [76], and which\r\nlikewise are to be met with on the shores of the isle, in the river,\r\nsituate below Albany. The easterly shore of the river is uncultivated,\r\nwoody, and hilly; but the western is flat, cultivated, and chiefly\r\nturned into corn-fields, which had no drains, though they wanted them\r\nin some places. It appeared very plainly here, that the river had\r\nformerly been broader. For there is a sloping bank on the corn-fields,\r\nat about thirty yards distance from the river, with which it always\r\nruns parallel. From this it sufficiently appears, that the rising\r\nground formerly was the shore of the river, and the corn-fields its\r\nbed. As a further proof, it may be added, that the same shells which\r\nabound on the present shore of the river, and are not applied to any\r\nuse by the inhabitants, ly plentifully scattered on these fields. I\r\ncannot say whether this change was occasioned by the diminishing of the\r\nwater in the river, or by its washing some earth down the river, and\r\ncarrying it to its sides, or by the river’s cutting deeper in on the\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nAll the grounds were ploughed very even, as is usual in the Swedish\r\nprovince of Upland. Some were sown with yellow, and others with white\r\nWheat. Now and then we saw great fields of flax, which was now\r\nbeginning to flower. In some parts it grows very well, and in others it\r\nwas but indifferent. The excessive drought which had continued\r\nthroughout this spring, had parched all the grass and plants on hills\r\nand high grounds, leaving no other green, plant than the common Mullein\r\n(Verbascum Thapsus Linn.) which I saw in several places, on the driest\r\nand highest hills, growing in spite of the parching heat of the sun,\r\nand though the pastures and meadows were excessively poor, and afforded\r\nscarce any food at all, yet the cattle never touched the Mullein. Now\r\nand then I found fields with pease, but the Charlock, (Sinapis arvensis\r\nLinn.) kept them quite under. The soil in most of these fields is a\r\nfine mould, which goes pretty deep.\r\n\r\nThe wild vines cover all the hills along the rivers, on which no other\r\nplants grow, and on those which are covered with trees, they climb to\r\nthe tops of them, and wholly cover them, making them bend down with\r\ntheir weight. They had already large grapes; we saw them abundant all\r\nthis day, and during all the time that we kept to the river Hudson, on\r\nthe hills, along the shores, and on some little islands in the river.\r\n\r\nThe white-backed Maize-thieves appeared now and then, flying amongst\r\nthe bushes: their note is fine, and they are not so large as the black\r\nmaize-thieves, (Oriolus Phœniceus). We saw them near New York, for the\r\nfirst time.\r\n\r\nWe found a Water-beech tree (Platanus occidentalis) cut down near the\r\nroad, measuring about five feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nThis day, and for some days afterwards, we met with islands in the\r\nriver. The larger ones were cultivated, and turned into corn-fields and\r\nmeadows.\r\n\r\nWe walked about five English miles along the river to-day, and found\r\nthe ground, during that time, very uniform, and consisting of pure\r\nearth. I did not meet with a single stone on the fields. The Red Maple,\r\nthe Water-beech, the Water-asp, the wild Prune-tree, the Sumach, the\r\nElm, the wild Vines, and some species of Willows, were the trees which\r\nwe met with on the rising shores of the river, where some Asparagus\r\n(Asparagus officinalis) grew wild.\r\n\r\nWe passed the night about six miles from Albany, in a countryman’s\r\ncottage. On the west side of the river we saw several houses, one after\r\nanother, inhabited by the descendants of the first Dutch settlers, who\r\nlived by cultivating their grounds. About half an English mile beyond\r\nour lodgings, was the place where the tide stops in the river Hudson,\r\nthere being only small and shallow streams above it. At that place they\r\ncatch a good many sorts of fish in the river.\r\n\r\nThe barns were generally built in the Dutch way, as I have before\r\ndescribed them [77]; for in the middle was the threshing-floor, above\r\nit a place for the hay and straw, and on each side stables for horses,\r\ncows, and other animals. The barn itself was very large. Sometimes the\r\nbuildings in the court-yard consist only of a room, and a garret above\r\nit, together with a barn upon the above plan.\r\n\r\nJune the 22d. This morning I followed one of our guides to the\r\nwater-fall near Cohoes, in the river Mohawk, before it falls into the\r\nriver Hudson. This fall is about three English miles from the place\r\nwhere I passed the night. The country till the fall is a plain, and\r\nonly hilly about the fall itself. The wood is cleared in most places,\r\nand the ground cultivated, and interspersed with farm-houses.\r\n\r\nThe Cohoes Fall is one of the greatest in North America. It is in the\r\nriver Mohawk, before it unites with the river Hudson. Above and below\r\nthe fall, the sides and the bottom of the river consist of hard rock.\r\nThe river is three hundred yards broad here. At the fall there is a\r\nrock crossways in the river, running every where equally high, and\r\ncrossing in a strait line with the side which forms the fall. It\r\nrepresents, as it were, a wall towards the lower side, which is not\r\nquite perpendicular, wanting about four yards. The height of this wall,\r\nover which the water rolls, appeared to me about twenty or twenty-four\r\nyards. I had marked this height in my pocket-book; and afterwards found\r\nit agreed pretty well with the account which that ingenious engineer,\r\nMr. Lewis Evans, communicated to me at Philadelphia. He said, that he\r\nhad geometrically measured the breadth and height of the fall, and\r\nfound it nine hundred English feet broad, and seventy-five feet high.\r\nThe representation of this fall, which is here joined, has been made by\r\nMr. Evans. There was very little water in the river at present, and it\r\nonly ran over the fall in a few places. In such places where the water\r\nhad rolled down before, it had cut deep holes below into the rock,\r\nsometimes to the depth of two or three fathoms. The bed of the river,\r\nbelow the fall, was of rock, and quite dry, there being only a channel\r\nin the middle fourteen feet broad, and a fathom or somewhat more deep,\r\nthrough which the water passed which came over the fall. We saw a\r\nnumber of holes in the rock, below the fall, which bore a perfect\r\nresemblance to those in Sweden which we call Giants Pots, or Mountain\r\nKettles. They differed in size; there being large deep ones, and small\r\nshallow ones. We had clear uninterrupted sun-shine, not a cloud above\r\nthe horizon, and no wind at all. However, close to this fall, where the\r\nwater was in such a small quantity, there was a continual drizzling\r\nrain, occasioned by the vapours which rose from the water during its\r\nfall, and were carried about by the wind. Therefore, in coming within a\r\nmusket-shot of the fall, against the wind, our cloaths were wetted at\r\nonce, as from a rain. The whirlpools, which were in the water below the\r\nfall, contained several kinds of fish; and they were caught by some\r\npeople, who amused themselves with angling. The rocks hereabouts\r\nconsist of the same black stone which forms the hills about Albany.\r\nWhen exposed to the air, it is apt to shiver into horizontal flakes, as\r\nslate does.\r\n\r\nAt noon we continued our journey to Canada in the canoe, which was\r\npretty long, and made out of a white pine. Somewhat beyond the farm\r\nwhere we lay at night, the river became so shallow that the men could\r\nreach the ground every where with their oars; it being in some parts\r\nnot above two feet, and sometimes but one foot deep. The shore and bed\r\nof the river consisted of sand and pebbles. The river was very rapid,\r\nand against us; so that our rowers found it hard work to get forward\r\nagainst the stream. The hills along the shore consisted merely of soil;\r\nand were very high and steep in some parts. The breadth of the river\r\nwas generally near two musket-shot.\r\n\r\nSturgeons abound in the river Hudson. We saw them for several days\r\ntogether leap high up into the air, especially in the evening; our\r\nguides, and the people who lived hereabouts, asserted that they never\r\nsee any sturgeons in winter time, because these fish go into the sea\r\nlate in autumn, but come up again in spring and stay in the river all\r\nthe summer. They are said to prefer the shallowest places in the river,\r\nwhich agreed pretty well with our observations; for we never saw them\r\nleap out of the water but in shallows. Their food is said to be several\r\nkinds of confervæ, which grow in plenty in some places at the bottom of\r\nthe river; for these weeds are found in their bellies when they are\r\nopened. The Dutch who are settled here, and the Indians, fish for\r\nsturgeons, and every night of our voyage upon this river, we observed\r\nseveral boats with people who struck them with harpoons. The torches\r\nwhich they employed were made of that kind of pine, which they call the\r\nblack pine here. The nights were exceedingly dark, though they were now\r\nshortest, and though we were in a country so much to the South of\r\nSweden. The shores of the river lay covered with dead sturgeons, which\r\nhad been wounded with the harpoon, but escaped, and died afterwards;\r\nthey occasioned an insupportable stench during the excessive heat of\r\nthe weather.\r\n\r\nAs we went further up the river we saw an Indian woman and her boy\r\nsitting in a boat of bark, and an Indian wading through the river, with\r\na great cap of bark on his head. Near them was an island on which there\r\nwere a number of Indians at present, on account of the sturgeon\r\nfishery. We went to their huts to try if we could get one of them to\r\naccompany us to Fort St. Frederic. On our arrival we found that all the\r\nmen were gone into the woods a hunting this morning, and we were forced\r\nto engage their boys to go and look for them. They demanded bread for\r\npayment, and we gave them twenty little round loaves; for as they found\r\nthat it was of great importance to us to speak with the Indians, they\r\nraised difficulties, and would not go till we gave them what they\r\nwanted. The island belonged to the Dutch, who had turned it into\r\ncorn-fields. But at present they had leased it to the Indians, who\r\nplanted their maize and several kinds of melons on it. They built their\r\nhuts or wigwams on this island, on a very simple plan. Four posts were\r\nput into the ground perpendicularly, over which they had placed poles,\r\nand made a roof of bark upon them. They had either no walls at all, or\r\nthey consisted of branches with leaves, which were fixed to the poles.\r\nTheir beds consisted of deer-skins which were spread on the ground.\r\nTheir utensils were a couple of small kettles, and two ladles, and a\r\nbucket or two of bark, made so close as to keep water. The sturgeons\r\nwere cut into long slices, and hung up in the sunshine to dry, and to\r\nbe ready against winter. The Indian women were sitting at their work on\r\nthe hill, upon deer-skins. They never make use of chairs, but sit on\r\nthe ground: however, they do not sit cross-legged, as the Turks do, but\r\nbetween their feet, which, though they be turned backwards, are not\r\ncrossed, but bent outwards. The women wear no head-dress, and have\r\nblack hair. They have a short blue petticoat, which reaches to their\r\nknees, and the brim of which is bordered with red or other ribbands.\r\nThey wear their shifts over their petticoats. They have large\r\near-rings: and their hair is tied behind, and wrapped in ribbands.\r\nTheir Wampum, or Pearls, and their money, which is made of shells, are\r\ntied round the neck, and hang down on the breast. This is their whole\r\ndress. They were now making several kinds of work of skins, to which\r\nthey sowed the quills of the American Porcupines, having dyed them\r\nblack or red, or left them in their original colour.\r\n\r\nTowards evening, we went from hence to a farm close to the river, where\r\nwe found only one man, looking after the maize and the fields; the\r\ninhabitants being not yet returned since the end of the war.\r\n\r\nThe little brooks here contain Crawfish, which are exactly the same\r\nwith ours [78], with this difference only, that they are somewhat less;\r\nhowever, the Dutch inhabitants will not eat them.\r\n\r\nJune the 23d. We waited a good while for the Indians, who had promised\r\nto come home, in order to shew us the way to Fort St. Ann, and to\r\nassist us in making a boat of bark, to continue our voyage. About eight\r\no’clock three of the men arrived. Their hair was black, and cut short;\r\nthey wore rough pieces of woollen cloth, of a bright green colour, on\r\ntheir shoulders, a shirt which covers their thighs, and pieces of\r\ncloth, or skins, which they wrap round the legs and part of the thighs.\r\nThey had neither hats, caps, nor breeches. Two of them had painted the\r\nupper part of their foreheads, and their cheeks, with vermilion. Round\r\ntheir neck was a ribband, from which hung a bag down to the breast,\r\ncontaining their knives. They promised to accompany us for thirty\r\nshillings; but soon after changed their minds, and went with an\r\nEnglishman, who gave them more. Thus we were obliged to make this\r\njourney quite alone. The Indians, however, were honest enough to return\r\nus fifteen shillings, which we had paid them before-hand.\r\n\r\nOur last night’s lodging was about ten English miles from Albany.\r\nDuring the last war, which was just now ended, the inhabitants had all\r\nretreated from thence to Albany, because the French Indians had taken\r\nor killed all the people they met with, set the houses on fire, and cut\r\ndown the trees. Therefore, when the inhabitants returned, they found no\r\nhouses, and were forced to ly under a few boards which were huddled\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe river was almost a musket-shot broad, and the ground on both sides\r\ncultivated. The hills near the river were steep, and the earth of a\r\npale colour.\r\n\r\nThe American Elder (Sambucus occidentalis [79]) grows in incredible\r\nquantities along those hills, which appear quite white, from the\r\nabundance of flowers on the Elder.\r\n\r\nAll this day along, we had one current after another, full of stones,\r\nwhich were great obstacles to our getting forward. The water in the\r\nriver was very clear, and generally shallow, being only from two to\r\nfour feet deep, running very violently against us in most places. The\r\nshore was covered with pebbles, and a grey sand. The hills consisted of\r\nearth, were high, and stood perpendicular towards the river, which was\r\nnear two musket-shot broad. Sometimes the land was cultivated, and\r\nsometimes it was covered with woods.\r\n\r\nThe hills near the river abound with red and white clover. We found\r\nboth these kinds plentiful in the woods. It is therefore difficult to\r\ndetermine whether they were brought over by the Europeans, as some\r\npeople think; or whether they were originally in America, which the\r\nIndians deny.\r\n\r\nWe found Purslane (Portulaca oleracea) growing plentifully in a sandy\r\nsoil. In gardens it was one of the worst weeds.\r\n\r\nWe found people returning every where to their habitations, which they\r\nhad been forced to leave during the war.\r\n\r\nThe farms were commonly built close to the river, on the hills. Each\r\nhouse has a little kitchen-garden, and a still lesser orchard. Some\r\nfarms, however, had large gardens. The kitchen-gardens afford several\r\nkinds of gourds, water-melons, and kidney-beans. The orchards are full\r\nof apple-trees. This year the trees had few or no apples, on account of\r\nthe frosty nights which had happened in May, and the drought which had\r\ncontinued throughout this summer.\r\n\r\nThe houses hereabouts are generally built of beams of wood, and of\r\nunburnt bricks dried by the sun and the air. The beams are first\r\nerected, and upon them a gable with two walls, and the spars. The wall\r\non the gable is made of boards. The roof is covered with shingles of\r\nfir. They make the walls of unburnt bricks, between the beams, to keep\r\nthe rooms warmer; and that they might not easily be destroyed by rain\r\nand air, they are covered with boards on the outside. The cellar is\r\nbelow the house.\r\n\r\nThe farms are either built close to the river-side, or on the high\r\ngrounds; and around them are large fields with maize.\r\n\r\nWe saw great numbers of Musk-Rats (Castor Zibethicus Linn.) on the\r\nshores of the river, where they had many holes, some on a level with\r\nthe surface of the water. These holes were large enough to admit a\r\nkitten. Before and in the entrance to the holes, lay a quantity of\r\nempty shells, the animals of which had been eaten by the Musk-Rats\r\n[80]. They are caught in traps placed along the water-side, and baited\r\nwith some maize or apples.\r\n\r\nThe Sassafras-trees abound here, but never grow to any considerable\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nChestnut-trees appear now and then.\r\n\r\nThe Cockspur Hawthorn (Cratægus Crus Galli Linn.) grows in the poorest\r\nsoil, and has very long spines; which shews, that it may be very\r\nadvantageously planted in hedges, especially in a poor soil.\r\n\r\nThis night we lodged with a farmer, who had returned to his farm after\r\nthe war was over. All his buildings, except the great barn, were burnt.\r\n\r\nJune the 24th. The farm where we passed the night was the last in the\r\nprovince of New York, towards Canada, which had been left standing, and\r\nwhich was now inhabited. Further on, we met still with inhabitants: but\r\nthey had no houses, and lived in huts of boards; the houses being burnt\r\nduring the war.\r\n\r\nAs we continued our journey, we observed the country on both sides of\r\nthe river to be generally flat, but sometimes hilly; and large trails\r\nof it are covered with woods of fir-trees. Now and then we found some\r\nparts turned into corn-fields and meadows; however, the greater part\r\nwas covered with woods. Ever since we left Albany, almost half-way to\r\nSaratoga, the river runs very rapid; and it cost us a deal of pains to\r\nget upwards. But afterwards it becomes very deep, for the space of\r\nseveral miles; and the water moves very slowly. The shores are very\r\nsteep, though they are not very high. The river is two musket-shot\r\nbroad. In the afternoon it changed its direction; for hitherto its\r\ndirection was from North to South, but now it came from N. N. E. to S.\r\nS. W. and sometimes from N. E. to S. W.\r\n\r\nAnthills are very scarce in America; and I do not remember seeing a\r\nsingle one before I came to the Cohoes Fall. We observed a few in the\r\nwoods to-day. The Ants were the same with our common red ones (Formica\r\nrufa Linn.) The Ant-hills consist chiefly of the slate-like mouldered\r\nstone which abounds here, there being nothing else for them.\r\n\r\nChestnut-trees grew scattered in the woods. We were told, that\r\nMulberry-trees (Morus rubra Linn.) likewise grow wild here, but rather\r\nscarce; and this is the most northerly place where they grow in\r\nAmerica; at least, they have not been observed further to the north. We\r\nmet with wild parsneps every day; but commonly in such places where the\r\nland was or had been cultivated. Hemp grows spontaneously, and in great\r\nabundance, near old plantations.\r\n\r\nThe woods abound with Woodlice, which were extremely troublesome to us.\r\n\r\nThe Thuya occidentalis Linn. appeared along the shores of the river. I\r\nhad not seen it there before.\r\n\r\nThe trees which grow along the shores, and on the adjacent hills,\r\nwithin our sight to-day, are elms, birches, white firs, alders,\r\ndog-trees, lime-trees, red willows, and chestnut-trees. The American\r\nElder, (Sambucus Canadensis Linn.) and the wild vines, only appear in\r\nplaces where the ground has been somewhat cultivated, as if they were\r\ndesirous of being the companions of men. The lime-trees and white\r\nwalnut-trees are the most numerous. The horn-beams, with inflated\r\ncones, (Carpinus Ostrya Linn.) appeared now and then; but the\r\nwater-beech and water-poplar never came within sight any more.\r\n\r\nWe frequently saw ground-squirrels and black squirrels in the woods.\r\n\r\nAt a little distance from Saratoga, we met two Indians in their boats\r\nof bark, which could scarce contain more than one person.\r\n\r\nNear Saratoga the river becomes shallow and rapid again. The ground is\r\nhere turned into corn-fields and meadows, but on account of the war, it\r\nwas not made use of.\r\n\r\nSaratoga has been a fort built of wood by the English, to stop the\r\nattacks of the French Indians upon the English inhabitants in these\r\nparts, and to serve as a rampart to Albany. It is situated on a hill,\r\non the east-side of the river Hudson, and is built of thick posts\r\ndriven in to the ground, close to each other, in the manner of\r\npalisades, forming a square, the length of whose sides was within the\r\nreach of a musket-shot. At each corner are the houses of the officers,\r\nand within the palisades are the barracks, all of timber. This fort has\r\nbeen kept in order and was garrisoned till the last war, when the\r\nEnglish themselves in 1747 set fire to it, not being able to defend\r\nthemselves in it against the attacks of the French and their Indians;\r\nfor as soon as a party of them went out of the fort, some of these\r\nenemies lay concealed, and either took them all prisoners, or shot\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI shall only mention one, out of many artful tricks which were played\r\nhere, and which both the English and French who were present here at\r\nthat time, told me repeatedly. A party of French, with their Indians,\r\nconcealed themselves one night in a thicket near the fort. In the\r\nmorning some of their Indians, as they had previously resolved, went to\r\nhave a nearer view of the fort. The English fired upon them, as soon as\r\nthey saw them at a distance; the Indians pretended to be wounded, fell\r\ndown, got up again, ran a little way, and dropped again. Above half the\r\ngarrison rushed out to take them prisoners; but as soon as they were\r\ncome up with them, the French and the remaining Indians came out of the\r\nbushes, betwixt the fortress and the English, surrounded them, and took\r\nthem prisoners. Those who remained in the fort had hardly time to shut\r\nthe gates, nor could they fire upon the enemy, because they equally\r\nexposed their countrymen to danger, and they were vexed to see their\r\nenemies take and carry them off in their fight and under their cannon.\r\nSuch French artifices as these made the English weary of their\r\nill-planned fort. We saw some of the palisades still in the ground.\r\nThere was an island in the river, near Saratoga, much better situated\r\nfor a fortification. The country is flat on both sides of the river\r\nnear Saratoga, and its soil good. The wood round about was generally\r\ncut down. The shores of the river are high, steep, and consist of\r\nearth. We saw some hills in the north, beyond the distant forests. The\r\ninhabitants are Dutch, and bear an inveterate hatred to all Englishmen.\r\n\r\nWe lay over night in a little hut of boards erected by the people who\r\nwere come to live here.\r\n\r\nJune the 25th. Several saw-mills were built here before the war, which\r\nwere very profitable to the inhabitants, on account of the abundance of\r\nwood which grows here.\r\n\r\nThe boards were easily brought to Albany, and from thence to New York,\r\nin rafts every spring with the high water; but all the mills were burnt\r\nat present.\r\n\r\nThis morning we proceeded up the river, but after we had advanced about\r\nan English mile, we fell in with a water-fall, which cost us a deal of\r\npains before we could get our canoe over it. The water was very deep\r\njust below the fall, owing to its hollowing the rock out by the fall.\r\nIn every place where we met with rocks in the river, we found the water\r\nvery deep, from two to four fathoms and upwards; because by finding a\r\nresistance it had worked a deeper channel into the ground. Above the\r\nfall, the river is very deep again, the water glides along silently,\r\nand increases suddenly near the shores. On both sides till you come to\r\nFort Nicholson, the shore is covered with tall trees. After rowing\r\nseveral miles, we passed another water-fall, which is longer and more\r\ndangerous than the preceding one.\r\n\r\nGiants-pots [81], which I have described in the memoirs of the Royal\r\nSwedish Academy of Sciences, are abundant near the fall of the rock\r\nwhich extends across the river. The rock was almost dry at present, the\r\nriver containing very little water at this season of the year. Some of\r\nthe giants-pots were round, but in general they were oblong. At the\r\nbottom of most of them lay either stones or grit, in abundance. Some\r\nwere fifteen inches in diameter, but some were less. Their depth was\r\nlikewise different, and some that I observed were above two foot deep.\r\nIt is plain that they owed their origin to the whirling of the water\r\nround a pebble, which by that means was put in motion, together with\r\nthe sand.\r\n\r\nWe intended to have gone quite up to Fort Nicholson in the canoe, which\r\nwould have been a great convenience to us; but we found it impossible\r\nto get over the upper fall, the canoe being heavy, and scarce any water\r\nin the river, except in one place where it flowed over the rock, and\r\nwhere it was impossible to get up, on account of the steepness, and the\r\nviolence of the fall. We were accordingly obliged to leave our canoe\r\nhere, and to carry our baggage through unfrequented woods to Fort Anne,\r\non the river Woodcreek which is a space from forty-three to fifty\r\nEnglish miles, during which we were quite spent, through the excess of\r\nheat. Sometimes we had no other way of crossing deep rivers, than by\r\ncutting down tall trees, which stood on their banks, and throwing them\r\nacross the water. All the land we passed over this afternoon was almost\r\nlevel, without hills and stones, and entirely covered with a tall and\r\nthick forest, in which we continually met with trees which were fallen\r\ndown, because no one made the least use of the woods. We passed the\r\nnext night in the midst of the forest, plagued with muskitoes, gnats,\r\nand wood-lice, and in fear of all kinds of snakes,\r\n\r\nJune the 26th. Early this morning we continued our journey through the\r\nwood, along the river Hudson. There was an old path leading to Fort\r\nNicholson, but it was so overgrown with grass, that we discovered it\r\nwith great difficulty. In some places we found plenty of raspberries,\r\nsome of which were already ripe.\r\n\r\nFort Nicholson is the place on the eastern shore of the river Hudson,\r\nwhere a wooden fortification formerly stood. We arrived here some time\r\nbefore noon, and rested a while. Colonel Lydius resided here till the\r\nbeginning of the last war, chiefly with a view of carrying on a greater\r\ntrade with the French Indians; but during the war, they burnt his\r\nhouse, and took his son prisoner. The fort was situated on a plain, but\r\nat present the place is all overgrown with a thicket. It was built in\r\nthe year 1709, during the war which Queen Anne carried on against the\r\nFrench, and it was named after the brave English general Nicholson. It\r\nwas not so much a fort, as a magazine to Fort Anne. In the year 1711,\r\nwhen the English naval attempt upon Canada miscarried, the English\r\nthemselves set fire to this place. The soil hereabouts seems to be\r\npretty fertile. The river Hudson passed close by here.\r\n\r\nSome time in the afternoon, we continued our journey. We had hitherto\r\nfollowed the eastern shore of the river Hudson, and gone almost due\r\nNorth; but now we left it, and went E. N. E. or N. E. across the woods,\r\nin order to come to the upper end of the river Woodcreek, which flows\r\nto Fort St. Frederic, where we might go in a boat from the former\r\nplace. The ground we passed over this afternoon was generally flat, and\r\nsomewhat low. Now and then we met with rivulets, which were generally\r\ndried up during this season. Sometimes we saw a little hill, but\r\nneither mountains nor stones, and the country was every where covered\r\nwith tall and thick forests. The trees stood close, and afforded a fine\r\nshade; but the pleasure which we enjoyed from it was lessened by the\r\nincredible quantity of gnats which fill the woods. We found several\r\nplants here, but they were far from each other, (as in our woods where\r\nthe cattle have destroyed them,) though no cattle ever came here. The\r\nground was every where thick covered with leaves of the last autumn. In\r\nsome places we found the ground over-grown with great quantities of\r\nmoss. The soil was generally very good, consisting of a deep mould, in\r\nwhich the plants thrive very well. Therefore it seems that it would\r\nanswer very well if it were cultivated: however, flowing waters were\r\nvery scarce hereabouts; and if the woods were cleared, how great would\r\nbe the effects of the parching heat of the sun, which might then act\r\nwith its full force!\r\n\r\nWe lodged this night near a brook, in order to be sufficiently supplied\r\nwith water, which was not every where at hand during this season. The\r\nmuskitoes, punchins or gnats, and the woodlice, were very troublesome.\r\nOur fear of snakes, and of the Indians rendered this night’s rest very\r\nprecarious and unsecure.\r\n\r\nPunchins, as the Dutch call them, are the little gnats (Culex pulicaris\r\nLinn.) which abound here. They are very minute, and their wings grey,\r\nwith black spots. They are ten times worse than the larger ones, (Culex\r\npipiens Linn.) or muskitoes; for their size renders them next to\r\nimperceptible; they are every where careless of their lives, suck their\r\nfill of blood, and cause a burning pain.\r\n\r\nWe heard several great trees fall of themselves in the night, though it\r\nwas so calm, that not a leaf stirred. They made a dreadful cracking.\r\n\r\nJune the 27th. We continued our journey in the morning. We found the\r\ncountry like that which we passed over yesterday, except meeting with a\r\nfew hills. Early this morning we plainly heard a fall in the river\r\nHudson.\r\n\r\nIn every part of the forest we found trees thrown down either by\r\nstorms, or age; but none were cut down, there being no inhabitants; and\r\nthough the wood is very fine, yet nobody makes use of it. We found it\r\nvery difficult to get over such trees, because they had stopped up\r\nalmost all the passages, and close to them was the chief residence of\r\nrattle-snakes, during the intenseness of the heat.\r\n\r\nAbout two o’clock this afternoon we arrived at Fort Anne. It lies upon\r\nthe river Woodcreek, which is here at its origin no bigger than a\r\nlittle brook. We stayed here all this day, and next, in order to make a\r\nnew boat of bark, because there was no possibility to go down the river\r\nto Fort St. Frederic, without it. We arrived in time, for one of our\r\nguides fell ill this morning, and could not have gone any further with\r\nhis burthen. If he had been worse, we should have been obliged to stop\r\non his account, which would have put us under great difficulties, as\r\nour provisions would soon have been exhausted, and from the desart\r\nplace where we were, we could not have arrived at any inhabited place\r\nin less than three or four days. Happily we reached the wish’d-for\r\nplace, and the sick man had time to rest and recover.\r\n\r\nAbout Fort Anne we found a number of mice, of the common kind. They\r\nwere probably the offspring of those which were brought to the fort in\r\nthe soldier’s provisions, at the time when it was kept in a state of\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\nWe met with some apple and plumb-trees, which were certainly planted\r\nwhen the fort was in a good condition,\r\n\r\nJune the 28th. The American Elm, (Ulmus Americana Linn.) grows in\r\nabundance, in the forests hereabouts. There are two kinds of it. One\r\nwas called the White Elm, on account of the inside of the tree being\r\nwhite. It was more plentiful than the other species, which was called\r\nthe Red Elm, because the colour of the wood was reddish. Of the bark of\r\nthe former the boats made use of here are commonly made, it being\r\ntougher than the bark of any other tree. With the bark of hiccory,\r\nwhich is employed as bast, they sow the elm-bark together, and with the\r\nbark of the red elm they join the ends of the boat so close as to keep\r\nthe water out. They beat the bark between two stones; or for want of\r\nthem, between two pieces of wood.\r\n\r\nThe making of the boat took up half yesterday, and all this day. To\r\nmake such a boat, they pick out a thick tall elm, with a smooth bark,\r\nand with as few branches as possible. This tree is cut down, and great\r\ncare is taken to prevent the bark from being hurt by falling against\r\nother trees, or against the ground. With this view some people do not\r\nfell the trees, but climb to the top of them, split the bark, and strip\r\nit off, which was the method our carpenter took. The bark is split on\r\none side, in a strait line along the tree, as long as the boat is\r\nintended to be; at the same time, the bark is carefully cut from the\r\nstem a little way on both sides of the slit, that it may more easily\r\nseparate; the bark is then peeled off very carefully, and particular\r\ncare is taken not to make any holes into it; this is easy when the sap\r\nis in the trees, and at other seasons the tree is heated by the fire,\r\nfor that purpose. The bark thus stript off is spread on the ground, in\r\na smooth place, turning the inside downwards, and the rough outside\r\nupwards, and to stretch it better, some logs of wood or stones are\r\ncarefully put on it, which press it down. Then the sides of the bark\r\nare gently bent upwards, in order to form the sides of the boat; some\r\nsticks are then fixed into the ground, at the distance of three or four\r\nfeet from each other, in the curve line, in which the sides of the boat\r\nare intended to be, supporting the bark intended for the sides; the\r\nsides of the bark are then bent in the form which the boat is to have,\r\nand according to that the sticks are either put nearer or further off.\r\nThe ribs of the boat are made of thick branches of hiccory, they being\r\ntough and pliable. They are cut into several flat pieces, about an inch\r\nthick, and bent into the form which the ribs require, according to\r\ntheir places in the broader or narrower part of the boat. Being thus\r\nbent, they are put across the boat, upon the back, or its bottom,\r\npretty close, about a span, or ten inches from each other. The upper\r\nedge on each side of the boat is made of two thin poles, of the length\r\nof the boat, which are put close together, on the side of the boat,\r\nbeing flat, where they are to be joined. The edge of the bark is put\r\nbetween these two poles, and sewed up with threads of bast, of the\r\nmouse-wood, or other tough bark, or with roots. But before it is thus\r\nsewed up, the ends of the ribs are likewise put between the two poles\r\non each side, taking care to keep them at some distance from each\r\nother. After that is done, the poles are sewed together, and being bent\r\nproperly, both their ends join at each end of the boat, where they are\r\ntied together with ropes. To prevent the widening of the boat at the\r\ntop, three or four transverse bands are put across it, from one edge to\r\nthe other, at the distance of thirty or forty inches from each other.\r\nThese bands are commonly made of hiccory, on account of its toughness\r\nand flexibility, and have a good length. Their extremities are put\r\nthrough the bark on both sides, just below the poles, which make the\r\nedges; they are bent up above those poles, and twisted round the middle\r\npart of the bands, where they are carefully tied by ropes. As the bark\r\nat the two ends of the boat cannot be put so close together as to keep\r\nthe water out, the crevices are stopped up with the crushed or pounded\r\nbark of the red elm, which in that state looks like oakum. Some pieces\r\nof bark are put upon the ribs in the boat, without which the foot would\r\neasily pierce the thin and weak bark below, which forms the bottom of\r\nthe boat, for the better security of which, some thin boards are\r\ncommonly laid at the bottom, which may be trod upon with more safety.\r\nThe side of the bark which has been upon the wood, thus becomes the\r\noutside of the boat, because it is smooth and slippy, and cuts the\r\nwater with less difficulty than the other. The building of these boats\r\nis not always quick; for sometimes it happens that after peeling the\r\nbark off an elm, and carefully examining it, it is found pierced with\r\nholes and splits, or it is too thin to venture one’s life in. In such a\r\ncase another elm must be looked out; and it sometimes happens that\r\nseveral elms must be stripped of their bark, before one is found fit\r\nfor a boat. That which we made was big enough to bear four persons,\r\nwith our baggage, which weighed somewhat more than a man.\r\n\r\nAll possible precautions must be taken in rowing on the rivers and\r\nlakes of these parts with a boat of bark. For as the rivers, and even\r\nthe lakes, contain numbers of broken trees, which are commonly hidden\r\nunder the water, the boat may easily run against a sharp branch, which\r\nwould tear half the boat away, if one rowed on very fast, exposing the\r\npeople in it to great danger, where the water is very deep, especially\r\nif such a branch held the boat.\r\n\r\nTo get into such a dangerous vessel, must be done with great care, and\r\nfor the greater safety, without shoes. For with the shoes on, and still\r\nmore with a sudden leap into the boat, the heels may easily pierce\r\nthrough the bottom of the boat, which might sometimes be attended with\r\nvery disagreeable circumstances, especially when the boat is so near a\r\nrock, and close to that a sudden depth of water; and such places are\r\ncommon in the lakes and rivers here.\r\n\r\nI never saw the muskitoes (Culex pipiens) more plentiful in any part of\r\nAmerica than they are here. They were so eager for our blood, that we\r\ncould not rest all the night, though we had surrounded ourselves with\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nWood-lice (Acarus Americanus Linn.) abound here, and are more plentiful\r\nthan on any part of the journey. Scarcely any one of us sat down but a\r\nwhole army of them crept upon his clothes. They caused us as much\r\ninconvenience as the gnats, during the last night, and the short time\r\nwe stayed here. Their bite is very disagreeable, and they would prove\r\nvery dangerous, if any one of them should creep into a man’s ear, from\r\nwhence it is difficult to extract them. There are examples of people\r\nwhose ears were swelled to the size of the fist, on account of one of\r\nthese insects creeping into them, and biting them. More is said about\r\nthem in the description which I have given to the Royal Swedish Academy\r\nof Sciences [82].\r\n\r\nThe Whipperiwill or Whip-poor-Will cried all night on every side. The\r\nFireflies flew in numbers through the woods at night.\r\n\r\nFort Anne derives its name from Queen Anne; for in her time it served\r\nas a fortification against the French. It lies on the Western side of\r\nthe river Woodcreek, which is here as inconsiderable as a brook, of a\r\nfathom’s breadth, and may be waded through in any part, during this\r\nseason. The fort is built in the same manner as the forts Saratoga and\r\nNicholson, that is to say, of palisades, within which the soldiers were\r\nquartered, and at the corners of which were the lodgings of the\r\nofficers. The whole consisted of wood, because it was erected only with\r\na view to resist irregular troops. It is built on a little rising\r\nground which runs obliquely to the river Woodcreek. The country round\r\nabout it is partly flat, partly hilly, and partly marshy, but it\r\nconsists merely of earth, and no stones are to be met with, though ever\r\nso carefully sought for. General Nicholson built this fort in the year\r\n1709; but at the conclusion of the war, then carrying on against the\r\nFrench, it shared the same fate with Saratoga and Fort Nicholson, being\r\nburnt by the English in 1711. This happened with the following\r\ncircumstance: In 1711 the English resolved to attack Canada, by land\r\nand by sea, at the same time. A powerful English fleet sailed up the\r\nriver St. Lawrence to besiege Quebec, and General Nicholson, who was\r\nthe greatest promoter of this expedition, headed a numerous army to\r\nthis place by land, to attack Montreal, at the same time from hence;\r\nbut a great part of the English fleet was shipwrecked in the river St.\r\nLawrence, and obliged to return to New England. The news of this\r\nmisfortune was immediately communicated to General Nicholson, who was\r\nadvised to retreat. Captain Butler who commanded Fort Mohawk, during my\r\nstay in America, told me that he had been at Fort Anne in 1711, and\r\nthat General Nicholson was about to leave it, and go down the river\r\nWoodcreek, in boats ready for that purpose, when he received the\r\naccounts of the disaster which befel the fleet. He was so enraged, that\r\nhe endeavoured to tear his wig, but it being too strong for him, he\r\nflung it to the ground, and trampled on it, crying out Roguery,\r\ntreachery. He then set fire to the fort, and returned. We saw the\r\nremains of the burnt palisades in the ground; and I asked my guides,\r\nWhy the English had been at so great an expence in erecting the fort,\r\nand why they afterwards burnt it without any previous consideration?\r\nThey replied, that it was done to get money from the government once\r\nmore, for the rebuilding of the fort, which money coming into some\r\npeople’s hands, they would appropriate a great part of it to\r\nthemselves, and erect again a wretched, inconsiderable fort. They\r\nfurther told me, that some of the richest people in Albany had promoted\r\ntheir poor relations to the places for supplying the army with bread,\r\n&c. with a view to patch up their broken fortunes; and that they had\r\nacquired such fortunes as rendered them equal to the richest\r\ninhabitants of Albany.\r\n\r\nThe heat was excessive to-day, especially in the afternoon, when it was\r\nquite calm. We were on the very spot where Fort Anne formerly stood; it\r\nwas a little place free from trees, but surrounded with them on every\r\nside, where the sun had full liberty to heat the air. After noon it\r\ngrew as warm as in a hot bath [83], and I never felt a greater heat. I\r\nfound a difficulty of breathing, and it seemed to me as if my lungs\r\ncould not draw in a sufficient quantity of air. I was more eased when I\r\nwent down into the vallies, and especially along the Woodcreek. I\r\ntried to fan the air to me with my hat, but it only encreased the\r\ndifficulty of breathing, and I received the greatest relief when I went\r\nto the water, and in a shady place frequently sprinkled some water in\r\nthe air. My companions were all very much weakened, but they did not\r\nfind such difficulty in breathing, as I had done; however towards\r\nevening the air became somewhat cooler.\r\n\r\nJune the 29th. Having compleated our boat, after a great deal of\r\ntrouble, we continued our journey this morning. Our provisions, which\r\nwere much diminished, obliged us to make great haste; for by being\r\nobliged to carry every thing on our backs, through the woods to Fort\r\nAnne, we could not take a great quantity of provisions with us, having\r\nseveral other very necessary things with us; and we did always eat very\r\nheartily. As there was very little water in the river, and several\r\ntrees were fallen across it, which frequently stopped the boat, I left\r\nthe men in the boat, and went along the shore with Yungstroem. The\r\nground on both sides of the river was so low, that it must be under\r\nwater in spring and autumn. The shores were covered with several sorts\r\nof trees, which stood at moderate distances from each other, and a\r\ngreat deal of grass grew between them. The trees afforded a fine shade,\r\nvery necessary and agreeable in this hot season; but the pleasure it\r\ngave was considerably lessened by the numbers of gnats which we met\r\nwith. The soil was extremely rich.\r\n\r\nAs we came lower down the river, the dykes, which the beavers had made\r\nin it, produced new difficulties. These laborious animals had carried\r\ntogether all sorts of boughs and branches, and placed them across the\r\nriver, putting mud and clay in betwixt them, to stop the water. They\r\nhad bit off the ends of the branches as neatly as if they had been\r\nchopped off with a hatchet. The grass about these places was trod down\r\nby them, and in the neighbourhood of the dykes we sometimes met with\r\npaths in the grass, where the beavers probably carried trees along. We\r\nfound a row of dykes before us, which stopped us a considerable while,\r\nas we could not get forwards with the boat, till we had cut through\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the river was more open, we got into the boat again, and\r\ncontinued our journey in it. The breadth of the river, however, did not\r\nexceed eight or nine yards, and frequently it was not above three or\r\nfour yards broad, and generally so shallow, that our boat got on with\r\ndifficulty. Sometimes it acquired such a sudden depth, that we could\r\nnot reach the ground with sticks of seven feet length. The stream was\r\nvery rapid in some places, and very slow in others. The shores were low\r\nat first, but afterwards remarkably high and steep, and now and then a\r\nrock projected into the water, which always caused a great depth in\r\nsuch places. The rocks consisted here of a grey quartz, mixed with a\r\ngrey limestone, lying in strata. The water in the river was very clear\r\nand transparent, and we saw several little paths leading to it from the\r\nwoods, said to be made by beavers, and other animals, which resorted\r\nhere to drink. After going a little more than three English miles, we\r\ncame to a place, where a fire was yet burning, and then we little\r\nthought that we had narrowly escaped death last night, as we heard this\r\nevening. Now and then we met with several trees lying across the river,\r\nand some dykes of beavers, which were troublesome to us.\r\n\r\nTowards night we met with a French serjeant, and six French soldiers,\r\nwho were sent by the commander of Fort St. Frederic, to accompany three\r\nEnglishmen to Saratoga, and to defend them in case of necessity,\r\nagainst six French Indians, who were gone to be revenged on the\r\nEnglish, for killing the brother of one of them in the last war. The\r\npeace was already concluded at that time, but as it had not yet been\r\nproclaimed in Canada, the Indians thought they could take this step;\r\ntherefore they silently got away, contrary to the order of the Governor\r\nof Montreal, and went towards the English plantations. We here had\r\noccasion to admire the care of Providence for us, in escaping these\r\nbarbarians. We found the grass trod down all day along, but had no\r\nthoughts of danger, as we believed that every thing was quiet and\r\npeaceable. We were afterwards informed, that these Indians had trod the\r\ngrass down, and passed the last night in the place where we found the\r\nburning brands in the morning. The usual road which they were to take,\r\nwas by Fort Anne, but to shorten their journey they had gone an\r\nunfrequented road. If they had gone on towards Fort Anne, they would\r\nhave met us without doubt, and looking upon us all as Englishmen, for\r\nwhose blood they were gone out, they could easily have surprised and\r\nshot us all, and by that means have been rid of the trouble of going\r\nany further to satisfy their cruelty. We were greatly struck when the\r\nFrenchmen told us how near death we had been to-day. We passed the\r\nnight here, and though the French repeatedly advised and desired me not\r\nto venture any further with my company, but to follow them to the first\r\nEnglish settlement, and then back to Fort St. Frederic, yet I resolved,\r\nwith the protection of the Almighty, to continue my journey the next\r\nday.\r\n\r\nWe saw immense numbers of those wild pigeons flying in the woods, which\r\nsometimes come in incredible flocks to the southern English colonies,\r\nmost of the inhabitants not knowing where they come from. They have\r\ntheir nests in the trees here; and almost all the night make a great\r\nnoise and cooing in the trees, where they roost. The Frenchmen shot a\r\ngreat number of them, and gave us some, in which we found a great\r\nquantity of the seeds of the elm, which evidently demonstrated the care\r\nof Providence in supplying them with food; for in May the seeds of the\r\nred maple, which abounds here, are ripe, and drop from the trees, and\r\nare eaten by the pigeons during that time: afterwards, the seeds of the\r\nelm ripen, which then become their food, till other seeds ripen for\r\nthem. Their flesh is the most palatable of any bird’s flesh I ever\r\ntasted.\r\n\r\nAlmost every night, we heard some trees crack and fall, whilst we lay\r\nhere in the wood, though the air was so calm that not a leaf stirred.\r\nThe reason of this breaking I am totally unacquainted with. Perhaps the\r\ndew loosens the roots of trees at night; or, perhaps there are too many\r\nbranches on one side of the tree. It may be, that the above-mentioned\r\nwild pigeons settle in such quantities on one tree as to weigh it down;\r\nor perhaps the tree begins to bend more and more to one side, from its\r\ncenter of gravity, making the weight always greater for the roots to\r\nsupport, till it comes to the point, when it can no longer be kept\r\nupright, which may as well happen in the midst of a calm night as at\r\nany other time. When the wind blows hard, it is reckoned very dangerous\r\nto sleep or walk in the woods, on account of the many trees which fall\r\nin them; and even when it is very calm, there is some danger in passing\r\nunder very great and old trees. I was told, in several parts of\r\nAmerica, that the storms or hurricanes sometimes only pass over a small\r\npart of the woods, and tear down the trees in it; and I have had\r\nopportunities of confirming the truth of this observation, by finding\r\nplaces in the forests, where almost all the trees were thrown down, and\r\nlay all in one direction.\r\n\r\nTea is differently esteemed by different people; and I think we would\r\nbe as well, and our purses much better, if we were both without tea and\r\ncoffee. However, I must be impartial, and mention in praise of tea,\r\nthat if it be useful, it must certainly be so in summer, on such\r\njourneys as mine, through a desart country, where one cannot carry wine\r\nor other liquors, and where the water is generally unfit for use, as\r\nbeing full of insects. In such cases, it is very relishing when boiled,\r\nand tea is drunk with it; and I cannot sufficiently describe the fine\r\ntaste it has in such circumstances. It relieves a weary traveller more\r\nthan can be imagined, as I have myself experienced, together with a\r\ngreat many others who have travelled through the desart forests of\r\nAmerica; on such journeys, tea is found to be almost as necessary as\r\nvictuals [84].\r\n\r\nJune the 30th. This morning we left our boat to the Frenchmen, who made\r\nuse of it to carry their provisions; for we could not make any further\r\nuse of it, on account, of the number of trees which the French had\r\nthrown across the river during the last war, to prevent the attacks of\r\nthe English upon Canada. The Frenchmen gave us leave to make use of one\r\nof their boats, which they had left behind them, about six miles from\r\nthe place where we passed the last night. Thus we continued our journey\r\non foot, along the river; and found the country flat, with some little\r\nvales here and there. It was every where covered with tall trees, of\r\nthe deciduous kind; among which the beech, the elm, the American\r\nlime-tree, and the sugar-maple, were the most numerous. The trees stand\r\nat some distance from each other; and the soil in which they grow is\r\nextremely rich.\r\n\r\nAfter we had walked about a Swedish mile, or six English miles, we came\r\nto the place where the six Frenchmen had left their bark boats, of\r\nwhich we took one, and rowed down the river, which was now between\r\nnineteen and twenty yards broad. The. ground on both sides was very\r\nsmooth, and not very high. Sometimes we found a hill consisting of grey\r\nquartz, mixed with small fine grains of grey spar. We likewise observed\r\nblack stripes in it; but they were small, that I could not determine\r\nwhether they were of glimmer, or of another kind of stone. The hills\r\nwere frequently divided into strata, lying one above another, of the\r\nthickness of five inches. The strata went from north to south; and were\r\nnot quite horizontal, but dipping to the north. As we went further on,\r\nwe saw high and steep hills on the river-side, partly covered with\r\ntrees; but in other parts, the banks consist of a swampy turf ground,\r\nwhich gave way when it was walked upon, and had some similarity to the\r\nsides of our marshes, which my countrymen are now about to drain. In\r\nthose parts where the ground was low and flat, we did not see any\r\nstones either on the ground, or on the softer shore; and both sides of\r\nthe river when they were not hilly, were covered with tall elms,\r\nAmerican lime-trees, sugar-maples, beeches, hiccory-trees, some\r\nwater-beeches, and white walnut-trees.\r\n\r\nOn our left we saw an old fortification of stones laid above one\r\nanother; but nobody could tell me whether the Indians or the Europeans\r\nhad built it.\r\n\r\nWe had rowed very fast all the afternoon, in order to get forward; and\r\nwe thought that we were upon the true road, but found ourselves greatly\r\nmistaken: for towards night we observed, that the reeds in the river\r\nbent towards us, which was a mark that the river likewise flowed\r\ntowards us; whereas, if we had been on the true river, it should have\r\ngone with us. We likewise observed, from the trees which lay across the\r\nriver, that nobody had lately passed that way, though we should have\r\nseen the steps of the Frenchmen in the grass along the shore, when they\r\nbrought their boat over these trees. At last, we plainly saw that the\r\nriver flowed against us, by several pieces of wood which floated slowly\r\ntowards us; and we were convinced, that we had gone twelve English\r\nmiles, and upwards, upon a wrong river, which obliged us to return, and\r\nto row till very late at night. We sometimes thought, through fear,\r\nthat the Indians, who were gone to murder some English, would\r\nunavoidably meet with us. Though we rowed very fast, yet we were not\r\nable to-day to get half-way back to the place where we first left the\r\ntrue river.\r\n\r\nThe most odoriferous effluvia sometimes came from the banks of the\r\nriver, towards night, but we could not determine what flowers diffused\r\nthem. However, we supposed they chiefly arose from the Asclepias\r\nSyriaca, and the Apocynum androsæmifolium.\r\n\r\nThe Musk-Rats could likewise be smelled at night. They had many holes\r\nin the shores, even with the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nWe passed the night in an island, where we could not sleep on account\r\nof the gnats. We did not venture to make a fire, for fear the Indians\r\nshould find us out, and kill us. We heard several of their dogs barking\r\nin the woods, at a great distance from us, which added to our\r\nuneasiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\nIn the first column of these tables, the Reader will find the days of\r\nthe month; in the second, the time or hour of the day, when the\r\nobservations were made; in the third, the rising and falling of the\r\nthermometer; in the fourth, the wind; and in the fifth, the weather in\r\ngeneral, such as rainy, fair, cloudy, &c.\r\n\r\nThe thermometer which I have made use of is that of Mr. Celsius, or the\r\nSwedish thermometer so called, as I have already pointed out in the\r\npreface. To distinguish the degrees above freezing-point from those\r\nbelow it, I have expressed the freezing-point itself by 00, and\r\nprefixed 0 to every degree below it. The numbers therefore which have\r\nno 0 before them, signify the upper degrees. Some examples will make\r\nthis still more intelligible. On the 17th of December it is remarked,\r\nthat the thermometer, at eight o’clock in the morning, was at 02.5. It\r\nwas therefore at 2 degrees and 5⁄10​, or half a degree, below the\r\nfreezing-point; but at two in the afternoon, it was at 00.0, or exactly\r\nupon the freezing-point. If it had been 00.3, it would have signified\r\nthat the thermometer was fallen 3⁄10 of a degree below the\r\nfreezing-point; but 0.3 would signify, that it was risen 3⁄10 of a\r\ndegree above the freezing-point. Thus likewise 03.0. is three degrees\r\nbelow the freezing-point; and 4.0. four degrees above it.\r\n\r\nThe numbers in the columns of the winds signify as follows: 0, is a\r\ncalm; 1, a gentle breeze; 2, a fresh gale; 3, a strong gale; and 4, a\r\nviolent storm or hurricane. When, in some of the last tables, the winds\r\nare only marked once a day, it signifies that they have not changed\r\nthat day. Thus, on the 21st of December, stands N. 0 fair. This shews\r\nthat the weather-cocks have turned to the north all day; but that no\r\nwind has been felt, and the sky has been clear all the day long.\r\n\r\nBefore I went to Canada in summer 1749, I desired Mr. John Bartram to\r\nmake some meteorological observations in Pensylvania, during my\r\nabsence, in order to ascertain the summer-heat of that province. For\r\nthat purpose, I left him a thermometer, and instructed him in the\r\nproper use of it; and he was so kind as to write down his observations\r\nat his farm, about four English miles to the south of Philadelphia. He\r\nis very excusable for not putting down the hour, the degree of wind,\r\n&c. for being employed in business of greater consequence, that of\r\ncultivating his grounds, he could not allow much time for this. What he\r\nhas done, is however sufficient to give an idea of the Pensylvanian\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            August 1748.\r\n\r\n    ===================================================================\r\n    D.  | H.    | Ther. | Wind.      | The Weather in general.\r\n    ----+-------+-------+------------+---------------------------------\r\n      1 | 5 m   |  20.0 | E S E 2    | Fair\r\n        | 2 a   |  24.5 | E 2        |\r\n      2 | 5 m   |  22.0 | E 2        |\r\n        | 2 a   |  24.5 | E 2        |\r\n      3 | 5 m   |  22.0 | E 1        |\r\n        | 2 a   |  25.5 | S S W 1    | Cloudy with some rain.\r\n      4 | 5 m   |  22.0 | S 1        | Alternately fair, cloudy and\r\n        | 1 a   |  21.0 | S 1        | rainy all day.\r\n      5 | 5 m   |  17.0 | S S W 1    | Chiefly rainy.\r\n      6 | 7 m   |  17.0 | S 2        | Cloudy.\r\n        | 2 a   |  19.0 | S 2        | Somewhat cloudy, but chiefly\r\n        |       |       |            | fair.\r\n      7 | 5 m   |  15.5 | S S W 2    | Alternately fair and cloudy.\r\n      8 | 5 m   |  18.0 | S S W 0    | Fair all day.\r\n        | 3 a   |  19.0 | S S W 0    |\r\n      9 | 6 m   |  17.5 | W N W 0    |\r\n        | 4 a   |  21.0 | W N W 1    |\r\n     10 | 6 m   |  18.5 | E 1        | Fair.\r\n        | 3 a   |  20.5 | E 1        |\r\n     11 | 6 m   |  47.0 | E N E 1    | Somewhat cloudy.\r\n        | ½ a   |  18.5 | S W 1      | Fair.\r\n        | 4     |  22.0 | S W 1      |\r\n        | 6     |  22.0 | W 3        |\r\n     12 | 6 m   |  16.0 | N W 1      | Cloudy with some drizzl. rain at\r\n        |       |       |            | ten.\r\n        | 4 a   |  19.0 | N W 1      | Cloudy, fair, some drizzl. rain\r\n        |       |       |            | altern.\r\n     13 | 6 m   |  17.0 | W N W 2    | Cloudy with some rain; foggy,\r\n        | 2 a   |  18.5 | W N W 2    | sometimes fair.\r\n     14 | 5 m   |  18.0 | W S W 0    | Somewhat cloudy, fair from 11 m.\r\n        |       |       |            | to 3 a.\r\n        | 4 a   |  20.0 | W S W 0    | Cloudy\r\n     15 | 5 m   |  18.0 | W S W 0    | Cloudy; sometimes fair; at ten\r\n        | 2 a   |  19.5 | N E 2      | o’clock fell a thin fog.\r\n     16 | 6 m   |  18.3 | N N E 2    | Somewhat cloudy; sometime fair.\r\n        | 2 a   |  18.5 |            | Dark; rainy at night.\r\n     17 | 6 m   |  18.5 | E N E 2    | Dark, with some drizzling rain.\r\n        | 2 a   |  19.5 |            | Drizzling rain all the\r\n        |       |       |            | afternoon.\r\n     18 | 6 m   |  19.0 | E 2        | Drizzling rain all the day.\r\n        | 2 a   |  20.5 |            |\r\n     19 | 6 m   |  19.5 |            | Cloudy\r\n        | 2 a   |  20.0 |            | Scattered clouds.\r\n     20 | 6 m   |  19.5 |            | Fair.\r\n        | 2 a   |  21.5 |            | Scattered clouds: sometimes\r\n        |       |       |            | rain.\r\n     21 | 6 m   |  20.8 | E 1        | Somewhat cloudy, fair at nine\r\n        | 2 a   |  21.3 |            | Thin clouds.\r\n     22 | 5 m   |  21.0 |            | Fair; about twelve it became\r\n        |       |       |            | cloudy.\r\n        | 1 a   |  23.5 | E S E 1    | Cloudy.\r\n     23 | 5 m   |  22.2 |            | Scattered clouds.\r\n        | 7     |       | S E 2      |\r\n        | 2 a   |  24.2 |            | Scattered clouds, dark towards\r\n        |       |       |            | eve.\r\n     24 | 5 m   |  23.5 | W S W 2    | Violent rain.\r\n        | 6     |       | W 2        |\r\n        | 7     |       | W N W 1    | About seven it cleared up.\r\n        | 9     |       | N W 1      |\r\n        | 2 a   |       |            | Scattered clouds.\r\n     25 | 6 m   |  24.5 | W 1        | Scattered clouds.\r\n        | 10    |       | W N W 3    |\r\n        | 2 a   |  23.5 |            |\r\n     26 | 6 m   |  24.0 | W 2        | Fair.

F.\r\n\r\n[3] A still more infallible remedy, is to wash all the furniture,\r\ninfected with that vermin, with a solution of arsenic. F.\r\n\r\n[4] In Siberia, and in the province of Wiatka, in the government of\r\nCazan, in Russia, the inhabitants make use of the knobs, which are\r\npretty frequently found in birches, to make bowls and other domestic\r\nutensils thereof. They are turned, made pretty thin, and covered with a\r\nkind of varnish, which gives them a pretty appearance; for the utensil\r\nlooks yellow, and is marbled quite in a picturesque manner, with brown\r\nveins. The best kind of these vessels are made so thin that they are\r\nsemi-diaphanous, and when put into hot water they grow quite pliant,\r\nand may be formed by main force, quite flat, but when again left to\r\nthemselves, and grown cold, they return to their original shape. This\r\nkind of wood is called, in Russia, Kap, and the vessels made of it,\r\nkappowie Tchashki, and are pretty high in price, when they are of the\r\nbest kind, and well varnished. F.\r\n\r\n[5] Though it is very desirable, that the members of the church of\r\nEngland may enjoy the same religious liberty in America as the rest of\r\ntheir fellow-subjects and have every part of their religious\r\nestablishment among themselves, and that therefore bishops might be\r\nintroduced in America, it is however to be feared this will prove one\r\nof the obstacles to the introducing of English bishops in that part of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n[6] See his Journal historique d’un voyage de l’Amerique. Tome v. p. m.\r\n311, and the 13th letter.\r\n\r\n[7] This account sufficiently proves, that these hares are a species\r\ndistinct from our European reddish grey kind, and also of that species\r\nor variety only, which in the northern parts of Europe and Asia is\r\nwhite in winter, with black tipped ears, and has a grey coat in summer.\r\nUpon a closer examination naturalists will perhaps find more characters\r\nto distinguish them more accurately. F.\r\n\r\n[8] Desm signifies musk in the Swedish, and in some provincial dialects\r\nof the German language; consequently Désman rat is nothing but\r\nMusk-rat, and from hence Mr. de Buffon has formed his Desman or Russian\r\nMusk-rat. F.\r\n\r\n[9] The Mink, or Minx, is a kind of small otter, which is called by Dr.\r\nLinnæus, Mustela lutreola, in his system. i. p. 66.

The purple\r\ndaw, and tab. 13. the red-winged starling: but as both these drawings\r\nare in a very expensive work, we have, from specimens lately brought\r\nover from America, made a new drawing, which represents them both, and\r\nit is engraved here, tab. I. F.\r\n\r\n[15] Probably nothing but an Aurora borealis.\r\n\r\n[16] Of this Pigeon of Passage we have given here a plate, tab. ii.\r\ntaken from a parcel of birds, lately brought from America, of which we\r\nwere favoured with a fine specimen. F.\r\n\r\n[17] Of this bird we have given a figure in plate 3, where likewise the\r\nMocking bird is represented; both drawn after specimens lately brought\r\nfrom America, and which we were favoured with. F.\r\n\r\n[18] Professor Kalm wrote this, when the truly laudable method of\r\ntreating the small-pox with a cold regimen, was not yet adopted; and he\r\nthought therefore, the way in which the Americans treated this disease,\r\nwas the cause of its being so deleterious. But when the Khalmucks, in\r\nthe Russian dominions, get the small-pox, it has been observed, that\r\nvery few escape. Of this I believe no other reason can be alledged,\r\nthan that the small-pox is always dangerous, either when the open pores\r\nof the human skin are too numerous, which is caused by opening them in\r\na warm water bath; or when they are too much closed, which is the case\r\nwith all the nations, that are dirty and greasy. All the American\r\nIndians rub their body with oils, the Khalmucks never wash themselves,\r\nand rub their bodies and their fur coats with grease; the Hottentots\r\nare I believe known to be patterns of filthiness, their bodies being\r\nrichly anointed with their ornamental greasy sheep guts; this shuts up\r\nall the pores; hinders perspiration entirely, and makes the small-pox\r\nalways lethal among these nations; to which we may yet add the too\r\nfrequent use of spirituous inflammatory liquors, since their\r\nacquaintance with the Europeans.

F.\r\n\r\n[28] These three points are common to most insects, and ought therefore\r\nnot to be made characteristics of any particular species. They are\r\ncalled Stemmata, and are a kind of eyes which serve the insects for\r\nlooking at distant objects, as the compound eyes do for objects near at\r\nhand. F.\r\n\r\n[29] It has been a subject of contest among naturalists, to determine\r\nthe winter-retreat of Swallows. Some think, they go to warmer climates\r\nwhen they disappear in the Northern countries: others say, they creep\r\ninto hollow trees, and holes in clefts of rocks, and ly there all the\r\nwinter in a torpid state: and others affirm, that they take their\r\nretreat into water, and revive again in spring. The two first opinions\r\nhave been proved, and it seems have found credit; the last has been\r\ntreated as ridiculous, and almost as an old woman’s tale. Natural\r\nhistory, as all the other histories, depends not always upon the\r\nintrinsic degree of probability, but upon facts founded on the\r\ntestimony of people of noted veracity.—Swallows are seldom seen sinking\r\ndown into the water, Swallows have not such organs as frogs or lizards,\r\nwhich are torpid during winter, ergo, Swallows live not, and cannot\r\nlive, under water.—This way of arguing, I believe, would carry us, in a\r\ngreat many cases, too far; for tho’ it is not clear to every one, it\r\nmay however be true: and lizards and frogs are animals of a class\r\nwidely different from that of birds, and must therefore of course have\r\na different structure; hence it is they are classed separately. The\r\nbear and the marmot are in winter in a torpid state, and have however\r\nnot such organs as lizards and frogs; and no body doubts of their\r\nbeing, during some time, in the most rigid climates in a torpid state:\r\nfor the Alpine Nations hunt the marmots frequently, by digging their\r\nholes up, and find them so torpid, that they cut their throats, without\r\ntheir reviving or giving the least sign of life during the operation;\r\nbut when the torpid marmot is brought into a warm room and placed\r\nbefore the fire, it revives from its lethargy. The question must\r\ntherefore be decided by fact; nor are they wanting here: Dr. Wallerius,\r\nthe celebrated Swedish Chemist, wrote in 1748, September the 6th O. S.\r\nto the late Mr. Klein, Secretary of the City of Dantzick: “That he has\r\nseen more than once Swallows assembling on a reed, till they were all\r\nimmersed and went to the bottom; this being preceded by a dirge of a\r\nquarter of an hour’s length. He attests likewise, that he had seen a\r\nSwallow caught during winter out of a lake with a net, drawn, as is\r\ncommon in Northern countries, under the ice: this bird was brought into\r\na warm room, revived, fluttered about, and soon after died.”\r\n\r\nMr. Klein applied to many Fermiers generaux of the King of Prussia’s\r\ndomains, who had great lakes in their districts, the fishery in them\r\nbeing a part of the revenue; in winter the fishery thereon is the most\r\nconsiderable under the ice, with nets spreading more than 200 or 300\r\nfathoms, and they are often wound by screws and engines, on account of\r\ntheir weight. All the people questioned made affidavits upon oath\r\nbefore the magistrates. First, The mother of the Countess Lehndorf\r\nsaid, that she had seen a bundle of Swallows brought from the Frish\r\nHaff (a lake communicating with the Baltic at Pillau) which when\r\nbrought into a moderately warm room, revived and fluttered about.\r\nSecondly, Count Schlieben gave an instrument on stamped paper,\r\nimporting, that by fishing on the lake belonging to his estate of\r\nGerdauen in winter, he saw several Swallows caught in the net, one of\r\nwhich he took up with his hand, brought it into a warm room, where it\r\nlay about an hour, when it began to stir, and half an hour after it\r\nflew about in the room. Thirdly, Fermier general (Amtman) Witkowski\r\nmade affidavit, that in the year 1740, three Swallows were brought up\r\nwith the net in the great pond at Didlacken; in the year 1741, he got\r\ntwo Swallows from another part of the pond, and took them home, (they\r\nall being caught in his presence); after an hour’s space they revived\r\nall in a warm room, fluttered about, and died three hours after. 4thly,\r\nAmtman Bönke says, that having had the estate Kleskow in farm, he had\r\nseen nine Swallows brought up in the net from under the ice, all which\r\nhe took into a warm room, where he distinctly observed how they\r\ngradually revived; but a few hours after they all died. Another time\r\nhis people got likewise some Swallows in a net, but he ordered them\r\nagain to be thrown into the water, 5thly, Andrew Rutta, a master\r\nfisherman, at Oletsko, made affidavit, 1747, that 22 years ago, two\r\nSwallows were taken up, by him, in a net, under the ice, and being\r\nbrought into a warm room, they flew about. 6thly, Jacob Kosiulo, a\r\nmaster fisherman, at Stradauen, made affidavit, that in 1736, he\r\nbrought up in winter, in a net, from under the ice of the lake at\r\nRaski, a seemingly dead Swallow, which revived in half an hour’s time,\r\nin a warm room, and he saw, a quarter of an hour after, the bird grow\r\nweaker, and soon after dying. 7thly, I can reckon myself among the\r\neye-witnesses of this paradoxon of natural history. In the year 1735,\r\nbeing a little boy, I saw several Swallows brought in winter by\r\nfishermen, from the river Vistula, to my father’s house, where two of\r\nthem were brought into a warm room, revived, and flew about. I saw them\r\nseveral times settling on the warm stove, (which the Northern nations\r\nhave in their rooms) and I recollect well that the same forenoon they\r\ndied, and I had them, when dead, in my hand.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1754, after the death of my uncle Godefroy Wolf, captain in\r\nthe Polish regiment of foot guards; being myself one of his heirs, I\r\nadministered for my co-heirs, several estates called the Starosty, of\r\nDirschau, in Polish Prussia, which my late uncle farmed under the king.\r\nIn January the lake of Lybshau, belonging to these estates, being\r\ncovered with ice, I ordered the fishermen to fish therein, and in my\r\npresence several Swallows were taken; which the fishermen threw in\r\nagain; but one I took up myself, brought it home, which was five miles\r\nfrom thence, and it revived, but died about an hour after its reviving.\r\nThese are facts, attested by people of the highest quality, by some in\r\npublic offices, and by others, who, tho’ of a low rank, however made\r\nthese affidavits upon oath. It is impossible to suppose\r\nindiscriminately that they were prompted by views of interest, to\r\nassert as a fact, a thing which had no truth in it. It is therefore\r\nhighly probable, or rather incontestably true, that Swallows retire in\r\nthe Northern countries during winter, into the water, and stay there in\r\na torpid state, till the return of warmth revives them again in spring.\r\nThe question therefore I believe ought for the future to be thus\r\nstated: The swallows in Spain, Italy, France, and perhaps some from\r\nEngland, remove to warmer climates; some English ones, and some in\r\nGermany and other mild countries, retire into clefts and holes in\r\nrocks, and remain there in a torpid state. In the colder northern\r\ncountries the Swallows immerse in the sea, in lakes, and rivers, and\r\nremain in a torpid state, under ice, during winter. There are still\r\nsome objections to this latter assertion, which we must remove. It is\r\nsaid, Why do not rapacious fish, and aquatic quadrupeds and birds,\r\ndevour these Swallows? The answer is obvious. Swallows chuse only such\r\nplaces in the water for their winter retreat, as are near reeds and\r\nrushes; so that sinking down there between them and their roots, they\r\nare by them secured against the rapaciousness of their enemies. But\r\nothers object, Why are not these birds caught in such waters as are\r\ncontinually harrassed by nets? I believe the same answer which has been\r\nmade to the first objection, will serve for this likewise. Fishermen\r\ntake care to keep off with their nets from places filled with reeds and\r\nrushes, for fear of entangling and tearing their nets; and thus the\r\nsituation of Swallows under water, is the reason that they are seldom\r\ndisturbed in their silent winter-retreats. What confirms this opinion\r\nstill more is, that Swallows were never caught in Prussia, according to\r\nthe above-mentioned affidavits, but with those parts of the net which\r\npassed near to the reeds and rushes; and sometimes the Swallows were\r\nyet fastened with their feet to a reed, when they were drawn up by the\r\nnet. As to the argument taken from their being so long under water\r\nwithout corruption, I believe, there is a real difference between\r\nanimals suffocated in water, and animals being torpid therein. We have\r\nexamples of things being a long time under water; to which we may add\r\nthe intense cold of these northern regions, which preserves them. Who\r\nwould have thought it, that snails and polypes may be dissected, and\r\ncould reproduce the parts severed from their body; if it was not a\r\nfact? Natural history ought to be studied as a collection of facts; not\r\nas the history of our guesses or opinions. Nature varies in an infinite\r\nmanner; and Providence has diversified the instinct of animals, and\r\ntheir œconomy, and adapted it to the various seasons and climates. This\r\nlong digression I thought necessary and excusable; and the more so, as\r\nthe ingenious great friends to the cause of Natural History, the late\r\nMr. Collinson, and Mr. Pennant, have both asserted the impossibility\r\nand improbability of this immersion. I revere the memory and the ashes\r\nof the one, and think the friendship of the other an honour to me: but\r\nam assured, that both prefer truth to their private opinion; and can\r\nbear a modest opposition, when it is proposed with candour, with a view\r\nto promote truth, and with sentiments of respect and gratitude, as it\r\nis done by me, in the present case.

Linn. The Swedes mention two kinds of lynx,\r\nthe one is called the Warglo, or wolf-lynx, and the other the Kattlo,\r\nor cat-lynx. The Germans make the same distinction, and call the former\r\nWolf-luchs, and the latter Katz-luchs: the former is the biggest, of a\r\nbrownish red, mixed with grey and white, on its back, and white towards\r\nthe belly, with brownish spots; the latter is smaller, and has a coat\r\nwhich is more white, and with more spots.

Hist. of Carol. ii. t. 48.\r\n\r\n[53] It has been found by repeated experience, that the specific\r\ncharacter employed by Dr. Linnæus, for the distinction of the species\r\nof snakes, taken from their Scuta abdominalia & caudalia, or their\r\nSquamæ subcaudales, varies greatly in snakes of the same species, so\r\nthat often the difference amounts to ten or more: the whole number of\r\nthe scuta sometimes helps to find out the species; care ought however\r\nto be taken, that the snake may not by any accident have lost its tail,\r\nand that it be growing again; in which case, it is impossible to make\r\nuse of this character. The character is not quite so good and decisive,\r\nas may be wished, but neither are the marks taken from colours, spots,\r\nstripes, &c. quite constant; and so it is better to make use of an\r\nimperfect character, than none at all. Time, and greater acquaintance\r\nwith this class of animals, may perhaps clear up their natural\r\ncharacters.

The older the rum is, and the longer it has\r\nbeen kept in a great cask, the more is its stypticity corrected. All\r\nwhich has been lately proved by the clearest experiments, explained and\r\ndeducted from the most indisputable principles of chymistry, in a\r\npamphlet written by that able chymist Mr. Dossie. F.\r\n\r\n[64] The New-York Sturgeons which I saw this year brought over, had\r\nshort blunt noses, in which particular they are different from the\r\nEnglish ones, which have long noses. F.\r\n\r\n[65] Mr. Kalm was certainly mistaken, by thinking the summits of these\r\nmountains without wood, on account of the great degree of heat: for it\r\nis a general notion, founded on experience, that the sun operates not\r\nso much on the tops of mountains, as in plains or vallies, and the cold\r\noften hinders the increase of wood on the summits of high mountains. F.\r\n\r\n[66] From the French Bateaux (Boats).\r\n\r\n[67] The reader must reckon all this according to the old stile.\r\n\r\n[68] I have mentioned them before. See vol. i. p. 176, 177.\r\n\r\n[69] Populus glandulis variis basi foliorum adnexis, foliis\r\ncordato-deltoidibus, acuminatis, serrato-angulosis, utrinque\r\nglabris.——An Populus heterophylla Linnæi?\r\n\r\n[70] See Vol. I. p. 228, &c.\r\n\r\n[71] New Jersey and part of Pensylvania were formerly comprized under\r\nthis name.\r\n\r\n[72] Mr. Kalm published his third volume just during the time of the\r\nlast war. F.\r\n\r\n[73] Mr. Kalm is, I believe, not right informed. The French\r\necclesiastics have allured some few wretched Indians to their religion\r\nand interest, and settled them in small villages; but by the accounts\r\nof their behaviour, in the several wars of the French and English, they\r\nwere always guilty of the greatest cruelties and brutalities; and more\r\nso than their heathen countrymen; and therefore it seems that they have\r\nbeen rather perverted than converted. On the other hand, the English\r\nhave translated the bible into the language of the Virginian Indians,\r\nand converted many of them to the true knowledge of God; and at this\r\npresent time, the Indian charity schools, and missions, conducted by\r\nthe Rev. Mr. Eleazar Wheelock, have brought numbers of the Indians to\r\nthe knowledge of the true God. The society for propagating the gospel\r\nin foreign parts, sends every year many missionaries, at their own\r\nexpence, among the Indians. And the Moravian Brethren are also very\r\nactive in the conversion of Gentiles; so that if Mr. Kalm had\r\nconsidered all these circumstances, he would have judged otherwise of\r\nthe zeal of the British nation, in propagating the gospel among the\r\nIndians.

F.\r\n\r\n[81] This is the literal meaning of the Swedish word jætte grytor. See\r\nthe memoirs of the Swed. Acad. of Sciences for the year 1743, p. 122.\r\nand Kalm’s vol. 1. p. 121.\r\n\r\n[82] See the Memoirs of the Royal Academy for the year 1754, page 19,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n[83] In Sweden and in Russia it is usual for people of all ranks to\r\nbathe every week at least one time; this is done in a stove heated by\r\nan oven, to a surprising degree, and which is enough to stifle people\r\nwho are not used to it: for commonly the heat is encreased by the hot\r\nsteam, caused by throwing red hot stones into water. In these baths, in\r\nRussia, the lower sort of people, men and women, bathe promiscuously,\r\nas the Romans did, and from whom, as Plutarch observes, in his Life of\r\nCato, the Greeks adopted this indelicate and indecent custom, and which\r\nspread so much, that the Emperor Adrian, and Marcus Antoninus were\r\nobliged to make laws against it, but neither were they long observed,\r\nfor we find soon the Council of Laodicea obliged to prescribe a canon\r\nagainst this brutal custom, and notwithstanding this we find soon after\r\nthat not only persons of all ranks, but even clergymen and monks bathed\r\npromiscuously with women, in the same baths; and from thence, it is\r\nprobable, this custom passed among the Russians, when christianity took\r\nplace among them. Near the bath, in Russia, is commonly a pond, where\r\nthe people plunge in, when quite hot, and in winter they welter in the\r\nsnow; and Saturdays it is common to see before the bath naked men and\r\nwomen, each having a bundle of rods in their hand, with which they\r\ngently beat one another, when in the bath. F.\r\n\r\n[84] On my travels through the desart plains, beyond the river Volga, I\r\nhave had several opportunities of making the same observations on Tea;\r\nand every traveller, in the same circumstances, will readily allow them\r\nto be very just.
