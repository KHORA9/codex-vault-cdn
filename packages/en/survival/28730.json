With the\r\ndestruction of the Spanish Armada in 1588, England rose from a minor\r\nposition in world affairs to one of major importance. One of the\r\nfirst changes was reflected in her attitude towards trade and\r\ncommerce. England was no longer penned up on her \"tight little isle,\"\r\nand her ships could sail the high seas in comparative safety.\r\nExpansion of her foreign trade seemed the only answer to her\r\nambitions, but foreign trade required a two way transfer of products.\r\nIn order to sell goods, it was necessary to buy in exchange. World\r\ncommerce had already become well stabilized among friendly nations\r\nmaking it difficult for outside businessmen to share in these\r\nestablished commitments. So England was soon to direct her attentions\r\ntoward America.\r\n\r\nIt was with eyes focused on future trade that the businessmen who\r\ncomposed the London Company contributed the huge sums that were\r\nrequired to finance the settlement at Jamestown, Virginia.\r\nAgriculture was not of prime importance. At that time England was\r\nself-sufficient so far as the production of grains and livestock was\r\nconcerned. Ordinary farm products would not pay the cost of\r\ntransportation across the ocean. Of course, it was expected that the\r\ncolonists would eventually produce their own food stuffs; however,\r\nuntil that stage of development occurred it was expected that the\r\nLondon Company would supply the needs of the colony direct from\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe men of the first expedition were not farmers and took little\r\ninterest in farming. A good many came, hoping to share in riches,\r\nthat their imagination had created. Fantastic tales about the\r\nAmericas had been circulated in Europe during the century following\r\ntheir discovery. The most authentic of these foreign travel journals\r\nhad been translated into English and published around the turn of the\r\nsixteenth century. Reports also of rich prizes, laden with gold,\r\ncaptured on the Spanish Main by English privateers, had inflamed the\r\nEnglish mind. If the Spaniards could find such vast treasures in\r\nAmerica, why should not the English do the same?\r\n\r\nThen too, as the first colony of Virginia lay between 34 and 41\r\ndegrees north-latitude, the same approximately as Italy and Spain, it\r\nwas expected that the much desired warm weather products enjoyed by\r\nthe Mediterranean people, such as oranges, lemons, sugar, and spices\r\ncould be produced equally as well in America. Jamestown eventually\r\ncontributed great financial benefits to the Mother Country from\r\nagricultural accomplishments. These benefits could not in 1607 be\r\nvisualized. To understand the vicissitudes which beset the colonists\r\nin the early years of the settlement, one should be familiar with the\r\nagricultural practices of both the Old World and the New, for it was\r\nby combining the farming wisdom of both sides of the Atlantic into a\r\nnew agriculture, that the colony became firmly established.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD WORLD AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nEuropean agriculture reached a high degree of efficiency two thousand\r\nyears ago in the scrub-forest region around the Mediterranean Sea. To\r\nthe Greeks that part of the world alone was considered fit for\r\nhabitation by human beings. Farming by the Romans was regarded as a\r\nhighly respectable and honorable occupation. Some of their most\r\nlearned scholars wrote books on husbandry. The Romans have given us\r\nby far the most complete and satisfactory accounts of their\r\nagriculture of any ancient people. During the \"Revival of Learning,\"\r\nthese old masterpieces were rediscovered, constituting the principal\r\nagricultural literature of Europe, prior to the eighteenth century.\r\nMost of the early English books on husbandry were mere translations\r\nof the Roman books on that subject, with a few original observations\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\nThe northern or colder parts of Europe were many centuries behind the\r\nMediterranean nations in agricultural achievement. At the time of the\r\ndiscovery of America, England and most of the nations of Europe were\r\ncontrolled by the feudal system. The arable land was owned in large\r\nestates or manors by feudal barons, the actual labor on the farms\r\nbeing performed by serfs. These farm laborers belonged to the land\r\nand were exchanged with it when there was a change in ownership of\r\nthe real estate. Farming was looked upon as necessary to existence,\r\nbut not as a business enterprise. Since trade and transportation in\r\nfarm products were extremely limited, consumption took place near the\r\nfields of production. It was more economical for a baron to move his\r\nfamily and retinue of servants to different parts of his domain than\r\nit was to transport the food stuffs to one central habitation. The\r\npossibility of serfs becoming land owners was too remote for\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTINENTAL INFLUENCES\r\n\r\nFarming practices in England before the eighteenth century were\r\nlargely adaptations from other European countries. The Romans, about\r\nthe beginning of the Christian era, took their husbandry to the\r\nBritish Isles. The Anglo-Saxons in the fifth century, brought in from\r\nthe mainland their farm practices. Likewise the Normans in the\r\neleventh century brought over their methods of tillage. Owing to the\r\nclose proximity to France, Flanders and Holland, agricultural\r\ninnovations in those countries were not long in gaining attention and\r\ntrial by the British farmers. The long hours of sunlight during short\r\nsummers, with the opposite conditions prevailing in the winters, have\r\ninfluenced the development of plant species in all northern\r\nlatitudes. Such seasonal conditions have also made necessary a\r\ndistinct type of farming. Many crops of the Mediterranean region do\r\nnot survive in north European countries. People in the colder regions\r\nalso require a different diet than do those living in the warmer\r\nclimates. By the seventeenth century an agriculture adapted to\r\nnorthern Europe had come into general practice. The implements used\r\nin farm work were, by modern standards, very crude and were\r\ncustomarily made by the local smith. A few hoes and mattocks,\r\nscythes, reaping hooks, spades and wooden plows with iron points and\r\nshares complete the list. The entire supply of tools for an average\r\nsized farm could have been hauled in one load on one of their\r\ntwo-wheeled carts.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROPS GROWN\r\n\r\nThe chief grains of northern Europe were wheat, rye, oats, barley,\r\nand buckwheat. The common grasses, clover and turnips, were raised\r\nfor forage. It should be noted that all of these crops were\r\nbroad-cast seeded, none required row planting or intertillage.\r\n\r\nA few American products had been brought to England prior to the\r\nsettlement at Jamestown. They apparently came by the way of Asia.\r\nMaize was first called Turkey wheat. The great American bird was\r\nnamed Turkey. Thomas Tusser in 1573 in his \"Five Hundred Pointes of\r\nGood Husbandrie\" enumerates the meats suitable for a Christmas dinner\r\nwith the following verse:\r\n\r\n    \"Beef, mutton and pork.\r\n    Shred pies of the best\r\n    Pig, veal, goose and capon\r\n    And Turkey well drest.\"\r\n\r\nNo earlier mention of anything strictly American in English\r\nliterature has come to light.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nLet us turn now and take a look at the farming accomplishments of the\r\nAmerican Indians. The oft repeated statement that the Indians lived\r\nmainly by hunting and fishing so far as it pertains to the Virginia\r\ntribes is far from the truth.\r\n\r\nThe bitter struggles between the white men and the Indians during\r\nthe colonial period created animosities and prejudices which have\r\novershadowed the beneficial contributions the red men have made to\r\ncivilization. As plant breeders, the American Indians rank with the\r\nmost skillful of the world. Take for instance, maize or Indian corn.\r\nThere is nothing closely comparable to it known to botanists. It has\r\nbeen domesticated so long that its wild prototype is unknown. Maize,\r\nnow, could not exist anywhere in the world without the aid of man.\r\nThe Indians had all the varieties that are now known, such as dent,\r\nflint, sweet, early, late, pop, and other special sorts which are no\r\nlonger grown. They had developed varieties that matured all the way\r\nfrom the tropics to the St. Lawrence River in Canada.\r\n\r\nThe Indians also practiced a mixed culture such as corn, beans, and\r\nsquashes all in the same hill; they had created a large number of\r\nvarieties of beans (_Phaseolus genus_): the white, red, black, and\r\nspotted sorts now so commonly grown, and many others.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN TILLAGE\r\n\r\nThe Indians were able to clear fields, of several hundred acres in\r\nextent, without the aid of metal tools, using fire as their chief\r\nagent. Trees, too large to be cut with their stone hatchets, were\r\nkilled either by building a fire at the base or by girdling the bark.\r\nThe trees in dying furnished fire wood for domestic use. Planting\r\nbegan among the dead trees wherever enough loose dirt could be\r\nscraped together to make a hill for seeding. In the course of time\r\nthe fields became entirely free from forest growth. These fields were\r\ncropped in most cases until their fertility was exhausted and then\r\nabandoned. If there was no more available fertile land in the\r\nvicinity, the tribe moved to a new location. The early white settlers\r\non the Atlantic Coast found many of these abandoned clearings.\r\nBecause of their unproductiveness they were called \"poisoned fields.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indians had only the crudest sorts of farming tools. Near the\r\ncoast, sea shells were the most efficient implements they possessed.\r\nThe fresh-water clam-shells came next in usefulness. Where these\r\nnatural scrapers were not available, pointed sticks, and pieces of\r\nflat rock served the purpose. One writer describing the Illinois\r\nIndians' method of farming says:\r\n\r\n     This tillage consists in breaking up just the surface of the\r\n     earth with a sort of wooden instrument, like a little pickaxe,\r\n     which they make by splitting the end of a thick piece of wood,\r\n     that serves for a handle, and putting another piece of wood,\r\n     sharp pointed at one end into the slit. This instrument serves\r\n     them instead of a hoe or spade, for they have no iron tools.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN VS. OLD WORLD CULTURE\r\n\r\nAttention has been called to the fact that all of the field crops of\r\nGreat Britain, at the time of the English settlements in America,\r\nwere broad-cast seeded. The Indians had developed a far different\r\ncultural treatment for their crops. In their most common method, that\r\nof hill planting, the soil in the intervening spaces was not broken.\r\nThe hills, two to four feet apart, were from 12 to 20 or more inches\r\nin diameter. The soil in these hills was all that was stirred or\r\nloosened. All weeds, both in the hills and the intervals between\r\nthem, were kept cut or pulled out. Four to six grains of maize and\r\ntwo or three beans were seeded in each hill, separately spaced.\r\nSquashes and pumpkins were sometimes seeded with the corn and beans.\r\nThis mixed seeding is a unique feature of American agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were fortunate in not having to contend with many of the\r\nweeds, insects and plant-diseases which now plague farmers and\r\ngardeners. Practically all of these pests, some of quite recent date,\r\nare of Old World origin and have been introduced by white men, into\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nBirds and small animals gave the Indians more concern than all their\r\nother pests combined. It was customary to build in their gardens\r\nsmall watch-houses in which the young folks took turns in staying to\r\nscare away crows and other troublesome birds.\r\n\r\nThe same hills were used year after year and became in time quite\r\nsizable mounds, remains of which have persisted, in some localities,\r\nuntil modern times. In the southwestern parts of Michigan, the early\r\nsettlers found large tracts of ridged land, evidently relics of\r\nIndian agriculture. It is now thought that these areas were corn\r\nfields in which the seeding was made in continuous rows instead of\r\nhills. A French artist in Florida in 1564 pictured the Indians\r\nseeding their crops in rows.\r\n\r\nAfter a few years of failure in their attempts to grow American\r\ncrops, the English colonists adopted the Indian method of seeding,\r\nbut usually neglected the weeding, and were subjected to ridicule for\r\ntheir shiftlessness by the painstaking squaws. In using work-animals\r\nfor cultivating corn, it was found advantageous to destroy the weeds\r\nby stirring the ground in the intervening spaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SETTLEMENT OF JAMESTOWN\r\n\r\nOn the 26th day of April, 1607, three small ships carrying 105\r\ncolonists passed between Cape Charles and Cape Henry into Chesapeake\r\nBay for the purpose of founding a colony in the land called Virginia.\r\nThe voyagers took seventeen days to investigate the advantages and\r\ndisadvantages of that region for such an undertaking.\r\n\r\nFirst consideration for selecting the site was its possibilities for\r\ndefense against a foreign foe, especially the Spaniards, in Florida\r\nand the West Indies. This was no idle fear. Spain and England had for\r\nmany years been in conflict. Moreover, Spain claimed all of the\r\nAmericas by the right of discovery.\r\n\r\nThe second most important thing for consideration was adequate harbor\r\nfacilities. In both of these particulars, the site selected about\r\nthirty miles up the James River left little to be desired. The\r\nJamestown peninsula jutted out into the river far enough to give an\r\nunobstructed view for several miles. The character of the land on\r\neither side of the river would have made difficult any attempt at an\r\noverland attack.\r\n\r\nThe James was sufficiently deep to take care of any ocean going\r\nvessels of that time. The heavily forested surroundings furnished\r\nprotection from violent storms. The channel ran near the shore. Ships\r\ncould be moored by cables to trees on the land.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of raising food stuffs, the colonists could\r\nhardly have picked a more unfavorable situation. The peninsula was\r\nconnected with the shore to the north by a narrow neck of land\r\n\"thirty yards over.\" As this narrow strip of land was usually flooded\r\nduring times of high water, the peninsula was for most purposes an\r\nisland by which designation it is generally known.\r\n\r\nThere were about eight hundred and fifty acres of heavily timbered\r\nforest lands on the island and about eight hundred acres of marsh\r\ncovered with coarse reedy grasses but there was no cleared land ready\r\nfor seeding.\r\n\r\nClearing forest lands even with modern tools and equipment is a slow\r\nlaborious process. Cutting down the trees is only a beginning. The\r\nstumps with their interlocking root systems have to be removed. It\r\ntakes many years for hardwood stumps to rot to a condition that they\r\nmay be easily destroyed. Although the trees on Jamestown Island were\r\nlarge, they could be cut, and those with straight grained boles rived\r\ninto clapboards, or the logs rolled into piles and burned for their\r\nashes, a product that was in demand in England for use in the\r\nmanufacture of soap.\r\n\r\nThe soil on the Island may not have been very fertile. The fact that\r\nthe Indians had never cleared any of the land indicates they did not\r\nconsider it of the best quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ATTEMPTS AT FARMING\r\n\r\nCaptain Newport assigned a third of the settlers, or about\r\nthirty-five men, to husbandry. Nothing came from their labors. At one\r\nof their first attempts to plant corn, probably English grain, they\r\nwere assaulted by a few venturesome Indians which so discouraged the\r\nsettlers, that they made no further efforts to provide crops for food\r\nthat season. One of the colonists complained about the difficulties\r\nof preparing land for corn. Another mentions that some made gardens.\r\nThe growing season was too far spent when they finally settled at\r\nJamestown to allow for clearing land for spring-seeded grains.\r\n\r\nBy mid-summer their food supply was becoming seriously depleted.\r\nFortunately the Indians remained friendly. Captain John Smith informs\r\nus that in July:\r\n\r\n     It pleased God to move the Indians to bring us corn ere it was\r\n     halfe ripe to refresh us and in September they \"brought us great\r\n     store both of corne and bread ready made.\"\r\n\r\nThey had four acres of ground prepared the following year which they\r\nseeded to \"corn\" (wheat, barley or peas). No details are given except\r\nthat nothing came from their efforts. Two growing seasons had passed\r\nand not a bushel of grain had been produced for their sustenance.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVESTOCK\r\n\r\nGreater success came from their attempts to raise animals than\r\nattended their efforts to grow crops. A few animals were brought in.\r\nReverend W. Simmonds states that: \"three sowes in eighteene moneths,\r\nincreased sixty and odd piggs. And neere 500 chickens brought up\r\nthemselves without having any meat given them.\"\r\n\r\nMore livestock was evidently brought in the two supplies which\r\narrived in 1608 as it was reported, at the time Smith left the colony\r\nin the fall of 1609, that they had \"six mares and a horse; five or\r\nsixe hundred swine; as many hennes and chickens; some goats some\r\nsheepe.\" Captain John Smith during his two years with the colony was\r\nremarkably successful in obtaining from the Indians several hundred\r\nbushels of corn and beans in exchange for English manufactured goods.\r\nThe fertile bottom lands of the rivers north of the James yielded\r\nbountiful harvests for the Indians as they have since for Virginians.\r\nGlass beads and tinkling bells intrigued the natives. The white man's\r\nclothing was also a source of wonderment. It was Smith's contention\r\nthat the white laborers should devote their time to getting out\r\nclapboards, pitch and soap-ashes to ship to England and depend on the\r\nIndians to keep the colony supplied with food. Smith was not a\r\nfarmer. He little realized that the Indians' desire for trinkets\r\nwould soon be satisfied. Then, too, public opinion in England,\r\naroused by the Las Casas exposures of Spanish cruelties in the West\r\nIndies would not sanction forced enslavement of the natives. With the\r\ndeparture of Smith, in October, 1609, the lucrative Indian trade came\r\nto an end. No other member of the colony had the courage, for\r\nsometime, to visit the tribes along the York and Rappahannock rivers\r\nfor the exchange of products.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST WHITE FARMER IN VIRGINIA\r\n\r\nThe first experienced English farmer to come to the colony was\r\nWilliam Spence, who arrived on the _Phoenix_, April 20, 1608. He was\r\nvariously described as a laborer, gentleman, and ensign. Ralph Hamor\r\ncertified to his character as \"an honest, valiant, and industrious\r\nman.\" Spence survived the ordeals of the early years and was a member\r\nof the first House of Burgesses, in 1619. He probably lost his life\r\nin the Indian massacre of 1622. Five persons, names not given, were\r\nkilled at that time on the Spence farm. Alexander Brown states that\r\nEnsign Spence is reported lost in 1623 but he may have been living in\r\ncaptivity.\r\n\r\nIt appears from this meager evidence that William Spence lived on his\r\nfarm outside of the fortified area. If such were the case, he may\r\nhave set a precedent that has had a pronounced influence on the\r\ndevelopment of this country. It was the belief of the authorities in\r\nthe London Company that the colonists would all live in small\r\ncommunities for mutual protection and perform their tillage\r\noperations, if any, outside the settlement. These communities,\r\nsometimes under the name of \"particular plantations\" and sometimes\r\n\"hundreds\" were necessary in the early days. But from the beginning\r\nthere were a few independent plantations, or farms, like that of\r\nWilliam Spence. Mention has been made of the impossibility of a farm\r\nlaborer in the Old Country ever attaining land ownership. But, here\r\nin America with its boundless acres, that great boon seemed within\r\ntheir reach. When allotments of land were finally made to individuals\r\nit was found advantageous for the owner to live on his farm, rather\r\nthan to operate it from a remote village. Freedom, independence, and\r\nthe importance of the individual, which are characteristics of the\r\nAmerican farmers, came into existence.\r\n\r\nThe common storehouse for provisions, tried at first in Jamestown,\r\ncreated friction and illwill and in a few years was abandoned. The\r\nmembers of the Council were accused of favoritism and self indulgence\r\nin using the food and other products in the storehouse. To have and\r\nto hold a parcel of land and to enjoy the fruits of one's own labors\r\nhas been a compelling force in changing a wilderness into a mighty\r\nnation. That force had its inception in the infant colony at\r\nJamestown.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHANGE IN POLICY\r\n\r\nThe two years of failure to produce crops was convincing evidence\r\nthat English methods of farming were not suited to Virginia\r\nconditions. The colonists were ready to try something else. They\r\nturned to the Indians to learn the secret of their successful farming\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nA fortunate event occurred in the early spring of 1609. Two young\r\nIndians, by the names of Kemps and Tussore were taken prisoners in\r\nretaliation for the depredations of other Indians. At the time of\r\ntheir arrest they were described as \"the two most exact villaines in\r\nthe countrie, that would have betrayed both their king and kindred\r\nfor a piece of copper.\" That this statement was not deserved was\r\nproven later. These two young Indians liked the Englishmen and the\r\nEnglish way of living. It is also stated that while they were\r\nfettered prisoners they \"did double taske and taught us how to order\r\nand plant our fields.\"\r\n\r\nFood scarcity became in 1609 a serious problem. The eagerly looked\r\nfor supply ships from England did not come. To relieve the tension\r\n\"Many were billetted among the salvages, whereby we knewe all their\r\npassages, fields and habitations; how to gather and use their fruits\r\nas well as themselves.\"\r\n\r\nKemps and Tussore were given their liberty soon after corn planting\r\ntime. \"But so well they liked our companies they did not desire to\r\ngoe from us.\"\r\n\r\nNothing further is recorded as to the fate of Tussore, sometimes\r\ncalled Kinsock. Strachey, Secretary of the Colony who was in Virginia\r\n1610-1611, mentions having obtained certain information from\r\n\r\n     One Kemps, an Indian, who died the last year of the scurvye at\r\n     Jamestown, after he had dwelt with us almost one whole year,\r\n     much made of by our lord generall and who could speake a pretty\r\n     deale of English, and came orderly to church every day to\r\n     prayers, and observed with us the keeping of the Sabaoth both by\r\n     ceassing from labour and repairing to church.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARVING TIME\r\n\r\nDire disaster finally struck the colony. Food supplies were\r\nexhausted. Starvation became a reality. A general drought blanketed\r\neastern Virginia. The Indians too were on short rations. Smith, the\r\nprovider, who had been injured by an explosion of gunpowder, had\r\nreturned to England. It was one of the most cruel experiences ever\r\nendured by a group of men. The climax came during the winter of\r\n1609-10.\r\n\r\nA few quotations from the records of that period paint the picture in\r\nits most terrible colors. Lord De La Warr who arrived in 1610 just in\r\ntime to save the colony from abandonment reported to the London\r\nCompany:\r\n\r\n     Our people, together with the Indians (not to friend), had the\r\n     last winter destroyed and kild up all our hoggs, insomuch as of\r\n     five or six hundred (as it is supposed), there was not above one\r\n     sow, that we can heare of, left alive; not a henn nor a chick in\r\n     the forte (and our horses and mares they had eaten with the\r\n     first).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nNEW INSTRVCTION\r\n\r\nOF PLOWING AND SETTING\r\n\r\nOF CORNE, HANDLED\r\n\r\nIN MANNER, OF A DIALOGVE\r\n\r\nbetweene a Ploughman and a\r\n\r\n_Scholler_.\r\n\r\n_Wherein is proved plainely that Plowing and_\r\n\r\nSetting, is much more profitable and lesse\r\n\r\nchargeable, than Plowing and\r\n\r\nSowing.\r\n\r\nBy EDVVARD MAXEY.

Their most valuable achievement had been their\r\nacquired knowledge of the Indians' methods of farming. To make a bad\r\nsituation worse the Indians began to make trouble. Lord De La Warr\r\nspeaks of their \"late injuries and murthering of our men.\" It was not\r\nuntil 1611 that real farming got under way at Jamestown. Then corn\r\nplanting and fence building began in earnest.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR DALE TAKES CHARGE\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Dale with \"three ships, men, and cattell (100 kine, 200\r\nswine)\" arrived in Virginia May 10, 1611. Dale had seen military\r\nservice in the Old World and was a severe and strict disciplinarian.\r\nThe surviving colonists received a jolt in their manner of living.\r\nFrom habits of indolence into which they had fallen, owing to the hot\r\nclimate and lack of food, after the departure of Captain John Smith,\r\nthey were with little ceremony put to work. \"His first care therefore\r\nwas to imploy all hands in the setting of corne at the two forts at\r\nKecoughtan, Henry and Charles,\" wrote Ralph Hamor \"and about the end\r\nof May wee had an indifferent crop of good corne.\" This corn was\r\nplanted near what is now Hampton where Strachey says, \"so much ground\r\nis there cleared and open; enough with little labour alreddy prepared\r\nto receive corne or make viniards of two or three thowsand acres.\"\r\nWith corn planting completed, two palisaded forts were built for the\r\nprotection of a few men left to care for the crops. They made another\r\nplanting across Chesapeake Bay on the Virginia Cape. They had learned\r\nthe hard way that clearing the heavily timbered land at Jamestown was\r\nhopeless for immediate results. Dale then returned to Jamestown\r\n\"where the most companie were, and their daily and usual works,\r\nbowling in the streets.\" This game was interrupted and the men put to\r\nwork felling timber, repairing their houses and providing pointed\r\npickets for fencing a new town, which Dale proposed to build, eighty\r\nmiles above Jamestown.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRICO SETTLED\r\n\r\nIn August, 1611, Sir Thomas Gates arrived with \"six tall ships with\r\nthree hundred men, and one hundred kine and other cattel.\" Gates\r\nthoroughly approved of Dale's plans and policies and let him select\r\nabout three hundred of the best workers in the colony to build at\r\nHenrico, now Farrar's Island, at Dutch Gap.\r\n\r\n     Within ten or twelve daies he had invironed it with a pale, and\r\n     in honour of our noble Prince _Henry_, called it _Henrico_. The\r\n     next worke he did, was building at each corner of the towne a\r\n     high commanding watch-house, a church, and store-houses: which\r\n     finished, hee began to thinke upon convenient houses for\r\n     himselfe and men, which, with all possible speed hee could, he\r\n     effected to the great content of his companie, and all the\r\n     colonie.\r\n\r\n     This towne is situated upon a necke of a plaine rising land,\r\n     three parts invironed with the maine river, the necke of land\r\n     well impaled, makes it like an ile; it hath three streets of\r\n     well framed houses, a handsome church, and the foundation of a\r\n     better laid (to bee built of bricke), besides store-houses,\r\n     watch-houses, and such like. Upon the verge of the river there\r\n     are five houses, within live the honester sort of people, as\r\n     farmers in England, and they keepe continuall centinell for the\r\n     townes securitie.\r\n\r\n     About two miles from the towne, into the maine, is another pale,\r\n     neere two miles in length, from river to river, guarded with\r\n     severall commanders, with a good quantitie, of corne-ground\r\n     impailed, sufficiently secured to maintaine more than I suppose\r\n     will come this three yeeres.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPOMATTOX LANDS SEIZED\r\n\r\nThe Appomattox Indians, at the time of the Jamestown settlement, were\r\nlocated on a neck of land lying between the James and Appomattox\r\nRivers. Dale wanted this land. It was cleared, fertile, and easy to\r\nfence, so we are told:\r\n\r\n     About Christmas following in this same year 1611 in regard of\r\n     the injury done us ... without the losse of any except some few\r\n     salvages tooke it and their corne.\r\n\r\nThis newly acquired land he named New Bermudas and he divided it into\r\nseveral tracts known as \"hundreds.\" The term hundred was a relic of\r\nthe feudal system. It meant a political subdivision smaller than a\r\ncounty. It appears to have been Dale's intention that these hundreds\r\nor group plantations, often referred to as \"particular plantations,\"\r\nshould include the land that could be worked conveniently by the\r\nfarmers from their homes in a village or a town. This plan was not\r\npopular. As has been previously stated the colonial pioneers much\r\npreferred to live on the land they tilled. The term \"hundred\" lost\r\nits significance.\r\n\r\nRalph Hamor described the operations at New Bermudas in the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n     In the nether hundred he [Dale] first began to plant, for there\r\n     is the most corne-ground and with a pale of two miles cut over\r\n     from river to river, whereby we have secured eight English miles\r\n     in compasse.... Rochdale, by a crosse pale wel nigh foure miles\r\n     long, is also planted with houses along the pale, in which\r\n     hundred our hogs and cattell have twentie miles circuit to graze\r\n     in securely.\r\n\r\nOutstanding were the accomplishments of this taskmaster, Governor\r\nDale, in one year, with men many of whom were unaccustomed to manual\r\nlabor. While some were engaged in fence building and the construction\r\nof houses, others were employed in getting out clapboards. Still\r\nothers were gathering pitch and tar from the pine trees and burning\r\nlogs to make soap-ashes. The London Company had incurred heavy\r\nexpense in the settlement and was asking for something in return.\r\nProducts from the forests were all that were available. It is no\r\nwonder that the colonists complained bitterly about their hardships\r\nin their letters to the folks back home.\r\n\r\nIt was not Gov. Dale's purpose to develop an agricultural colony.\r\nSurplus from food products would not pay the cost of shipment across\r\nthe ocean. His plantings of corn were purely for local consumption.\r\nHe limited the number engaged in farming, and to each of those so\r\nengaged, he allotted three acres of corn land. These farmers were not\r\nallowed to devote their entire time to crop-raising. The livestock as\r\nwe have seen was allowed to run at large in the fenced ranges. In a\r\nletter dated June 14, 1614, Gov. Dale reported that he had set the\r\ncolonists to the task of \"husbanding our corne securely, whereof wee\r\nhave above five-hundred acres set, and God be praised in more\r\nforwardness than any of the Indians that I have seen or heard of this\r\nyeare.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Capt. Argall, as deputy governor superseded Dale in May, 1617,\r\nGeorge Yeardley having been acting governor from April 11, 1616, he\r\nreported that the colony had about four hundred people but not over\r\n200 fit for husbandry and tillage. As for livestock, they had 128\r\ncattle, 88 goats, and a large number of hogs. As to cattle there were\r\nabout \"fortie bulls and oxen but they wanted men to bring them to\r\nlabour and irons for the ploughs and harnesse for the cattell.\" They\r\nhad tried again to grow some small grains.\r\n\r\n     Thirtie or fortie acres wee had sowne with one plough, but it\r\n     stood so long on the ground before it was reaped it was most\r\n     shaken.\r\n\r\nThis was a pitiful showing for the ten years that had elapsed since\r\nCapt. Newport established the colony. It had been a decade of\r\nfrustration and heart-breaking disappointments, a decade of gruelling\r\ntoil and misery. No blame should be attached to the colonists. They\r\nwere thrust into a situation for which they were woefully\r\nunprepared.\r\n\r\nVirginia was destined to develop agriculturally. Attempts to suppress\r\nthat industry only served to prolong the colony's troubles. There\r\nwere no natural resources except the forests in the tidewater region;\r\nno Indian trade of any great value; no gems to be picked up at will;\r\nno minerals to be exploited. When the situation seemed most hopeless,\r\nthe culture of a crop new to English farming completely changed their\r\nmental and pecuniary outlook. Despair changed to violent optimism.\r\nJohn Rolfe is generally credited with having been, in 1612, the first\r\nVirginia planter to engage in the growing of tobacco. Governor Dale\r\nat the time frowned on its culture and ruled that two of each man's\r\nallotment of three acres of land should be seeded to corn. Hence the\r\nchange in governorship was a momentous event.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGE IN POLICY\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Thomas Dale left, in 1616, George Yeardley took over the\r\nmanagement of the colony as Acting Governor. He lost no time in\r\nputting an end to the restrictions on tobacco culture. The next year,\r\n1617, saw a remarkable transformation in the colonists' way of life.\r\nInertia gave way to frantic activity. \"The market-place and streets\r\nand all other spare places were set with the crop and the colonie\r\ndispersed all about planting tobacco.\" Nor is this surprising.\r\nTobacco alone promised them surcease from poverty and want. Hope for\r\na bountiful harvest spurred them on as it has spurred farmers in all\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOBACCO IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\nMany fantastic tales have been written about the introduction of the\r\nuse of tobacco in England. Some of the most authentic historical\r\nitems follow: The Spaniards found the natives in the West Indies\r\nusing the plant both for chewing and smoking. They took seed to\r\nEurope where its use soon spread to other countries around the\r\nMediterranean Sea.\r\n\r\nThe first Englishman to report on the addiction of the American\r\nIndians to the use of tobacco appears to have been John Sparke who\r\nwrote the account of the voyage of Sir John Hawkins who, in the\r\ncourse of his travels, spent some months, in 1565, with an ill-fated\r\nFrench colony in Florida. Sparke reported \"The Floridians when they\r\ntravell, have a kinde of herbe dried, who with a cane and an earthen\r\ncup in the end, with fire, and the dried herbs put together, doe\r\nsucke thorow the cane the smoke thereof, which smoke satisfieth their\r\nhunger, and therewith they live foure or five dayes without meat or\r\ndrinke, and this the Frenchmen used for this purpose.\" It is quite\r\nlikely that the sailors under Hawkins command acquired the habit and\r\ntook some of the \"dried herbs\" back to England.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Raleigh is often credited with the introduction of the use\r\nof tobacco in England. While he may not have been responsible for its\r\nintroduction, he apparently played an important role in the spread of\r\nthe tobacco habit among the English aristocracy. Raleigh's interest\r\nin tobacco was no doubt aroused by the report of his protégé, the\r\nfamous sixteenth century mathematician, Thomas Hariot. Hariot spent a\r\nyear, June, 1585-June, 1586, with the Raleigh Colony on Roanoke\r\nIsland. On his return to England he reported on the Indians' farming\r\noperations in Eastern North Carolina. For tobacco he wrote in part\r\n\"We ourselves, during the time we were there, used to sucke it after\r\ntheir manner, as also since our returne, and have found many rare and\r\nwonderful experiments of the virtues thereof, of which the relation\r\nwould require a volume by itselfe: the use of it by so many, of late,\r\nmen and women of great calling, as els, and some physicians also, is\r\nsufficient witnesse.\"\r\n\r\nRaleigh later made a voyage to the Island of Trinidad and the Orinoco\r\nRiver in South America from whence had come the most desirable sorts.\r\nSpain and Portugal monopolized the European tobacco trade with these\r\nmild varieties since the tobacco grown by the Virginia Indians had a\r\nsharp, biting taste. Plantings of these better sorts were made in\r\nEngland. A violent controversy was soon raging. King James I who\r\ndetested Raleigh and all his activities, issued a _Counter Blaste_\r\nagainst tobacco. This was a most bitter tirade as the following\r\nquotation shows:\r\n\r\n     A custom loathsome to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful to\r\n     the brain, dangerous to the lungs, and in the black stinking\r\n     fume thereof nearest resembling the stygian smoke of the pit\r\n     that is bottomless.\r\n\r\nSince the days of King James, millions of words have been written\r\ncondemning the use of the \"tawny weed.\"\r\n\r\nThe opposition of King James to tobacco led to the imposition of\r\ntaxes on its import into England: that from Spain and Portugal was 2d\r\na pound; that from Virginia 6s. 10d. In spite of all this array of\r\nevidence as to the detrimental effects of tobacco on the human body\r\nits consumption has steadily increased and spread over the entire\r\nworld. Colossal fortunes have been made in its processing and trade.\r\nNo product of the soil with the exception of grains used in the\r\nmanufacture of alcoholic beverages has ever returned such bounteous\r\nrevenues to the United States government. In the fiscal year ending\r\nJune 30, 1954 there was paid into the treasury of the United States,\r\nthe gigantic sum of $1,580,299,000 from taxes on various tobacco\r\nproducts. Of this vast total, Virginia tobacco manufacturers that\r\nyear contributed 356,867,000 dollars. Municipal and other local taxes\r\nare not included in these figures.\r\n\r\nTobacco culture in America was a highly profitable enterprise for\r\nEngland. The colonists produced and sold the raw product. Very little\r\ntobacco is used in the raw state. Before tobacco is ready for the\r\nmarket it must be processed into the various forms demanded by the\r\ntrade. It was estimated that one man engaged in tobacco growing in\r\nVirginia kept three Englishmen employed, that is, sailors engaged in\r\ntransportation, processors and tradesmen. The English government also\r\nderived considerable revenue on the surplus tobacco products resold\r\non the European market.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOBACCO BECAME MONEY\r\n\r\nOne of the needs of the colony was a medium of exchange: something\r\nthat could be used for money. As the balance of trade was heavily in\r\nfavor of the Mother Country, there was no opportunity for an\r\naccumulation of English money in America. So tobacco became\r\nacceptable for goods, services, and the payment of debts. Salaries\r\nwere fixed in pounds of tobacco.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLUCTUATING PRICES\r\n\r\nThe value placed on tobacco in England varied with the supply and\r\ndemand. With the introduction of Negroes in 1619, and the greatly\r\nincreased immigration from England, the acreage devoted to the\r\nculture of tobacco expanded rapidly. The first serious effects of\r\nover-production occurred in 1630, when the price fell from three\r\nshillings, six pence to one penny a pound. This calamity proved to be\r\na blessing in disguise. The next year, a boat of \"18 tons burden,\"\r\nloaded with corn and tobacco disposed of its cargo at Salem,\r\nMassachusetts, then but recently settled. The corn brought six\r\nshillings a bushel. This started a brisk trade and a Dutch ship, in\r\n1632, took 2,000 bushels of corn from Virginia to New England. In\r\n1633, it was estimated that 10,000 bushels of corn from Virginia were\r\nsold in Massachusetts besides a number of beef cattle, goats, and\r\nhogs. In spite of the ruinously low prices which sometimes prevailed,\r\nthe amount of tobacco shipped overseas continued to increase. In\r\n1639, 1,500,000 pounds were exported from Virginia alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROWTH OF THE COLONY\r\n\r\nCaptain John Smith summarized the condition of the colony in 1629 in\r\nthese words:\r\n\r\n     Master Hutchins saith, they have 2,000 cattle, and about 5,000\r\n     people; but Master Floud, John Davis, William Emerson, and\r\n     divers others, say about five thousand people, and five thousand\r\n     kine, calves, oxen, and bulls; for goats, hogs, and poultry;\r\n     corne, fish, deere, and many sorts of other wild beasts; and\r\n     fowle in their season, they have so much more than they spend,\r\n     they are able to feed three or foure hundred men more than they\r\n     have.\r\n\r\nStarving times as a rule were over. Periods of short rations occurred\r\ninfrequently and then only in times of disaster such as the aftermath\r\nof the Indian massacre of 1622 or when the planters became so\r\nengrossed in growing tobacco that they neglected to plant maize or\r\nother grains. Each succeeding crop was new wealth, something that had\r\nnot existed before. Gradually, harvest after harvest, the colonists\r\nwere able to add to their possessions additional tools and equipment.\r\n\r\nHe was a shiftless man indeed who could not provide ample food for\r\nhis own needs. The history of Virginia during colonial times was\r\nintimately connected with the tobacco crop. The general welfare of\r\nthe people rose and fell with the value placed on the leaf in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFORTS TO SUSTAIN HIGHER PRICES\r\n\r\nWith the over supply of tobacco the English market became extremely\r\ndiscriminating in regard to the quality of the leaf it would\r\npurchase. The colonial government from time to time resorted to\r\nlegislative expedients to prevent the shipment of inferior grades.\r\nGovernor Wyatt, in 1621 ordered that \"for every head they should\r\nplant but 1,000 plants of tobacco and upon each plant nine leaves.\"\r\nJohn Rolfe also stated, in 1619, that, \"An industrious man not\r\notherwaies imploied may well tend foure akers of corne, and 1,000\r\nplants of tobacco.\" A thousand plants would give each worker about\r\n112 pounds of tobacco a year. In 1628, an inspection law was enacted\r\nand in 1640, it was ordered that all bad tobacco and half the good\r\nshould be destroyed.\r\n\r\nGovernor Berkeley, in 1664, made several ineffectual attempts to form\r\nagreements, with the planters of Maryland and North Carolina, to\r\nrestrict the production of tobacco. The planters of each colony were\r\nwilling for those of the other to stop planting, or to destroy as\r\nmuch tobacco as they pleased; but looking to their own selfish\r\ninterests they would increase rather than decrease their crop. The\r\nVirginia General Assembly, in 1666, prohibited all culture of tobacco\r\nbut the Maryland authorities complained that the law was ignored by\r\nthe Virginia planters.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia colonists developed a keen rivalry among themselves in\r\nefforts to improve the quality of the leaf grown. Reverend John\r\nClayton, in 1688, says: \"For there is not only two distinct sorts of\r\nsweet-scented and Aranoko tobacco but of these be several sorts, much\r\ndifferent, the seeds whereof are known by distinct names, of those\r\ngentlemen most famed for such sort of tobacco, as of prior seed etc.\"\r\n\r\nThe Aranoko, probably from the Orinoco river region in South America,\r\nwas grown on the heavy clay soils. The product was a strong tobacco\r\nthat was most in demand in Germany and other North European\r\ncountries. The sweet-scented was grown on the lighter sandy soils and\r\nalthough the yield was less it brought a better price on the market.\r\nHugh Jones, in his _Present State of Virginia_, in 1724, mentions one\r\nof the many localities in Virginia which became noted for a\r\nparticular variety of tobacco grown there. To quote: \"For on York\r\nRiver in a small tract of land called Digges Neck, which is poorer\r\nthan a great deal of other land in the same latitude, by a particular\r\nseed and management, is made the famous crop known by the name of E\r\nDees, remarkable for its mild taste and fine smell.\"\r\n\r\nTopping the growing tobacco plants was a practice originated by the\r\ncolonists. The main purpose was to limit the production to the large\r\nlower leaves and to do away with the small immature leaves at the top\r\nof the stem. The General Assembly often specified the number of\r\nleaves which could be left; the number, varying with the value placed\r\non the leaf in England, ranged usually from six to nine.\r\n\r\nTobacco is a soil exhausting crop. The Jamestown planters soon\r\nlearned that continuous crops of tobacco, on the same land, soon\r\nreduced both the quantity and quality of the leaf. The only resource\r\nleft to the tobacco farmers was to clear new fields. The more\r\nwell-to-do planters began to seek favorable locations of uncleared\r\nland. The depleted fields were abandoned and the task of restoring\r\ntheir productivity was usually left to nature. Much of the best\r\ntobacco soils of Virginia have been cropped and then allowed to go\r\nback to brush and tress and again cleared several times. Finding the\r\nremains of old tobacco rows out in dense woods is not an uncommon\r\nexperience. This exhaustion of tobacco lands had a beneficial\r\ninfluence on the agricultural development of Virginia. By the time\r\nthe fields were abandoned, most of the stumps had decayed and the\r\nsoil could be prepared for seeding to other crops with plow and\r\nharrows. It was found that these depleted fields were still capable\r\nof producing satisfactory crops of grain. Many of the colonists who\r\nwere not financially able to clear new grounds could often buy or\r\nrent these abandoned fields for a nominal price.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROPS OTHER THAN TOBACCO\r\n\r\nWhile tobacco played a very important part in building a prosperous\r\ncolony at Jamestown, there were several other staples that also\r\ncontributed to this result. Of prime importance should be rated maize\r\nor Indian Corn. Maize saved the colony from starvation on several\r\noccasions. Maize became an export commodity to the New England and\r\nWest Indian colonies when the price for tobacco fell below the cost\r\nof transportation to Europe. Maize aided the colonists in the\r\nproduction of valuable livestock products. This crop has done more to\r\npromote the wealth and welfare of this country than all the natural\r\nresources, water-power, and forests put together. In order to\r\nincrease the production of grain in 1623, the General Assembly\r\nordered: \"For the encouragement of men to plant store of corne, the\r\nprise shall not be stinted but it shall be free for every man to sell\r\nit as deere as he can.\" This law had a wholesome effect. It so\r\nincreased the production of maize that seven years later as has\r\nalready been noted, the colonists had a surplus of this product to\r\nexport to New England. This is perhaps the first law passed in\r\nAmerica for the direct benefit of the producers. It stands out in\r\nstrong contrast to some legislative enactments. There were many other\r\ngrain laws put on the statute books but the majority of them either\r\nfixed the maximum price for which the grain could be sold or else\r\nprohibited its exportation. The authorities in England were\r\ncontinually clamoring for products to supplement the tobacco exports.\r\n\r\nUntil 1685, each succeeding Governor as he sailed to Virginia was\r\ninstructed to \"use every means in his power to encourage the\r\nproduction of silk, wine, hemp, flax, pitch and potashes.\" The reason\r\nfor finally omitting this clause is interesting. The King was\r\nconcerned about the revenue the government was deriving from tobacco\r\nand did not wish for the colonists to engage in any enterprise that\r\nmight diminish the volume of leaf that was coming to England. The\r\nomission of this clause marked a new era in the relation of the\r\ncolony to the Mother Country. During the sixty years the clause was\r\nin force, several Governors, notably Wyatt, Harvey and Berkeley, had\r\ntried to comply with the wishes of the authorities in England, with\r\nextremely meager results to show for their efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\nSILK CULTURE\r\n\r\nThere is very little justification for including silk culture as an\r\nenterprise in the agricultural history of the Jamestown Colony. It\r\nwas one product that was usually placed first in recommendations of\r\nthe authorities who sponsored the settlement of Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with the improved status of the social and economic life\r\nof England, in the latter years of the sixteenth century, came a\r\ndesire for finer and more lustrous fabrics in their articles of\r\ndress. Serges and tweeds, woven from the fleeces of their\r\ncoarse-wooled sheep, no longer satisfied the fastidious tastes of the\r\nruling aristocracy. Even calicos from far-away Calcutta were esteemed\r\nfit for royal inaugural gowns. Silk was the last word in luxurious\r\ngarb.\r\n\r\nSilkworms had been reared in the Orient from ancient times. These\r\nmoths had been domesticated for so many years they had become fully\r\ndependent on human aid for existence. They could crawl but could not\r\nfly. While silk brought fabulous prices on the world's market there\r\nwere numerous reasons why its culture never succeeded in America. The\r\nhandling of the creeping, crawling, ill-smelling worms was\r\nobjectionable to anyone not accustomed from childhood to the task.\r\nOld people and young girls who were the ones employed in rearing\r\nsilkworms in the Orient received the equivalent of a few cents a day\r\nfor their labor. Such cheap help was not available in Virginia.\r\nPerhaps, the most serious objection of all was the lack of a suitable\r\nfood supply for the worms. A silkworm from the time it hatches from\r\nthe egg till it spins its cocoon devours a mass of green forage.\r\nLeaves of the mulberry tree are its favorite diet. In fact, without a\r\nsupply of mulberry trees, successful silk culture is out of the\r\nquestion. Growing a crop of trees had to precede the rearing of\r\nworms. This took several years. Nevertheless, the directions of the\r\nLondon Company urged in season and out that the colonists should\r\nproduce silk.\r\n\r\nGovernor Wyatt, in 1621, was instructed: \"Not to permit any, but the\r\ncouncil and heads of hundreds, to wear gold in the clothes, or to\r\nwear silk till they make it themselves.\" Nothing came from this\r\norder. In 1656, the agitation for silk became so intense, the General\r\nAssembly was forced to take action. First, an experienced silk\r\ngrower, an Armenian by the name of George, was sent to the colony,\r\nand the General Assembly was ordered to give him four thousand pounds\r\nof tobacco to keep him in the country. Another law, passed that year,\r\nordered that each planter set out ten mulberry trees for each one\r\nhundred acres of land he owned. These trees were to be fenced, to\r\nprotect them from horses and cattle, and to be kept weeded. This law\r\nwas repealed, two years later, as it \"seems rather troublesome and\r\nburthensome than any waies advantageous to the country.\" The law was\r\nre-enacted in 1661 but given a three years delay as it was impossible\r\nto get mulberry trees. The General Assembly, in 1657, voted a bounty\r\nof 5000 pounds of tobacco to any planter producing 100 pounds of\r\nwound silk. There were no claimants. Two years later, the bounty was\r\nincreased to 10,000 pounds of tobacco and the amount of silk required\r\nwas reduced to 50 pounds. Again the results were negative. Then a\r\nbounty of fifty pounds of tobacco for each pound of silk was ordered.\r\nThe effects from all these orders are summed up in an act of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in 1663 which reads:\r\n\r\n     George, the Armenian, having proved the making of ten pounds of\r\n     wound silk, it is ordered there be paid him for his\r\n     encouragement in the levy according to act.\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that George received 500 pounds of tobacco. What became\r\nof the silk is not recorded. A few years later the price per pound of\r\nwound silk was fixed by the General Assembly at 20 shillings or two\r\nhundred pounds of tobacco.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEMP AND FLAX\r\n\r\nTwo plants, the culture of which was strongly urged by the English\r\nauthorities, were hemp and flax. In this case, greater success was\r\nrealized than occurred with most of the demands that came from across\r\nthe ocean. It had been ordered in 1658, by the General Assembly:\r\n\"That what person or persons, soever, shall at any time hereafter\r\nmake, in this colonie, so much silke, flax, hopps or any other staple\r\ncommodities (except tobacco) as is worth two hundred pounds sterling,\r\nor English wheate to the value of five hundred pounds stirling in one\r\nyeare, and exporte the same or cause the same to be exported, or\r\nshall first make two tunne of wine raized out of a vineyard made in\r\nthis collonie, shall have given him by this country, for an\r\nencouragement, ten thousand pounds of Virginia tobacco.\"\r\n\r\nApparently no one qualified for the bounty on flax for, in 1661,\r\nprovision was made for importing some flax seed from England. No\r\nprice was fixed, in 1666, on \"flax by reason of the uncertainty of\r\nthe quality.\" In 1682, bounties were offered: \"For every peck of flax\r\nseeds, four and twentie pounds of tobacco, and for every peck of hemp\r\nseed twenty pounds of tobacco.\" Bounties were also offered for hemp\r\nand flax woven into cloth. It was also ordered that every tithable\r\nperson should produce one pound of dressed hemp and one pound of\r\ndressed flax or two pounds of either annually. From that time on\r\nconsiderable hemp and flax were raised in Virginia, but most of the\r\ncrop was used at home. Linen cloth was highly prized. There was also\r\na demand for cordage made of hemp fibers for ships.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLISH GRAIN\r\n\r\nAs already noted, the initial attempts of the colonists to grow the\r\ngrains with which they had been accustomed in England came to naught.\r\nThey were familiar with wheat, rye, barley and oats. To make\r\nsatisfactory yields, these grains had to be broadcasted on well\r\nprepared seed beds. Newly cleared forests left the soil full of\r\nstumps and roots. The wooden plows of those days were useless on\r\nthese newly cleared lands. Preparation of the soil, for tobacco or\r\nmaize, could be accomplished with a hand hoe or shovel. These plants\r\nrequired space in which to develop their full growth. A tobacco plant\r\ncould be set or a hill of corn planted wherever a little loose dirt\r\ncould be found. Some English grains were seeded in the cleared land\r\nnear Hampton and Newport News but these old fields, abandoned by the\r\nIndians, were also near to exhaustion. An \"indifferent crop\" was\r\nreported.\r\n\r\nIn 1627, Abraham Piersey had 200 acres each in wheat and barley.\r\nFrom these crops he was able to furnish food daily to sixty persons.\r\nHow much of this seeding was on land that had been abandoned for\r\ntobacco, or was old Indian fields, is not stated. When DeVries\r\nvisited Virginia in 1643, he found the planters putting down, in\r\nEnglish grain, lands which had been exhausted by successive crops of\r\ntobacco. The General Assembly had ruled in 1639, that corn (probably\r\nwheat and maize) could be exported whenever the price fell below\r\ntwelve shillings a bushel. Large exports of this valuable cereal were\r\nthen being made to the near-by colonies of Maryland, Manhattan,\r\nCarolina and the West Indies.\r\n\r\nIt was estimated by Edward Williams, in 1650, that two able-bodied\r\nlaborers could seed sixty acres in wheat in the course of one season\r\nand reap the grain when it was ripe. The yield from such an area had\r\na market value of four hundred and eighty pounds sterling. It was\r\nreported that these fields which no longer produced the best grades\r\nof tobacco were better for wheat than newly cleared land. As these\r\nexhausted fields could be rented or purchased at moderate cost\r\ncompared with prime tobacco new ground, many poorly financed\r\ncolonists were able to get a start towards prosperity without\r\nresorting to the almost universal practice of growing tobacco.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVESTOCK\r\n\r\nAs already shown, the domestic animals brought to the Colony, in the\r\nfirst few years of its settlement, were turned out in the woods to\r\nfend for themselves. The original breeding stocks were of ordinary\r\nquality and the lack of care given them contributed to their\r\ninferiority. Predatory animals such as wolves, bears, panthers and\r\nwild cats exacted a heavy annual toll of young animals.\r\n\r\nUntil Governor Dale constructed his miles of picket fences there was\r\nnothing to keep the animals from wandering up into the highlands\r\nwhere the colonists did not dare to venture. In spite of the\r\nhandicaps all classes of domestic animals increased in numbers when\r\nnot slaughtered for food. This was especially true of swine.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n1 _Hoscyamin Perimianus._ Tabaco or Henbane of Peru.\r\n\r\n2 _Sana Sancta Indorum._ Tabaco of Trinidada.\r\n\r\nTwo varieties of tobacco as pictured by Gerard in 1597.

Williams\r\n\r\nTrenching Implements, Seventeenth Century]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Thomas L. Williams, Photo\r\n\r\nSeventeenth Century Plows]\r\n\r\n\r\nSWINE\r\n\r\nHogs contributed more to the material welfare of the Jamestown Colony\r\nthan historians have generally recognized. Hogs have many advantages\r\nover other breeds of livestock. They multiply much faster than any\r\nother domestic animal except poultry. They make faster gains and\r\ndouble the weight for the food consumed than do cattle, sheep or\r\ngoats. When slaughtered, hogs dress out about 75 percent edible meat,\r\nas compared with 55 to 60 percent for cattle. When given wide open\r\nrange in humid climates such as prevailed in the Tidewater, they do\r\nfairly well without other feed than what they can find for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIn summer, at Jamestown, they obtained most of their living in the\r\nnumerous fresh-water swamps. Tuckahoe, a flag-like swamp plant, with\r\nan enormous root system, was their favorite hot weather forage. The\r\nroots of tuckahoe, often as large as a man's arm, contain a\r\ncrystalline acid that burns the mouth of a human being like fire.\r\nAfter a few trials, hogs seem to relish it. While tuckahoe is not a\r\nfattening feed, hogs eating it make satisfactory gains in weight.\r\n\r\nIn the fall when the acorns and nuts ripened, the hogs put on weight\r\nat a rapid pace. The woods were stocked with oak, hickory, chestnut,\r\nbeech, chinquapin, and persimmon trees and shrubs, the fruits of\r\nwhich were all grouped under the general term _mast_. There is one\r\ndifference between pork produced from grain-fed hogs and those\r\nfattened on mast. The lard of the latter group melts at a temperature\r\nof about ten degrees below that of those fed corn. To the connoisseur\r\nof well cured hams and bacon this low melting point is not a\r\ndetriment but a distinct improvement.\r\n\r\nThe colonists adapted the Indian practice of using smoke to aid in\r\nthe curing of meat. The natives built platforms of poles supported by\r\nposts about six feet from the ground. The meat to be cured was salted\r\nand spread on these poles. A small fire was built underneath to\r\nfurnish the smoke. This arrangement was called by the Taino Indians,\r\na _barbacoa_ from which we get the English equivalent, _barbecue_.\r\n\r\nBy 1636, hogs, sheep and goats had increased in such numbers that\r\nships coming to Jamestown could supply their needs for meat from the\r\ncolony's surplus. This was advantageous to shipmasters and furnished\r\na market for a product of a growing industry in the colony. Prior to\r\nthat time ships coming to America from Europe had to take on food\r\nstuffs for the round trip.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit accrued to the colony. The combined curing process of\r\nsalt and smoke imparts a delicious flavor to hams and bacon that has\r\nnever been excelled by any other method. This applies especially to\r\nmeat from hogs fattened on mast or peanuts.\r\n\r\nVirginia hams and bacon soon became noted for their excellence all\r\nover the world. The fame of these products has never waned.\r\nUnfortunately, most hotels and restaurants in the United State now\r\nuse the term \"Virginia ham\" on their menus to designate this sort of\r\nmeat regardless of its origin or cure. New England ships, plying a\r\ncoastwise traffic with the Caribbean countries, frequently stopped in\r\nJamestown for cargoes of salted meats. This trade was especially\r\ndesirable during times when the price of tobacco fell to ruinous\r\nlevels. Most of the hogs ran wild. Some planters marked their animals\r\nby ear-cuts, and then could claim an entire drove, if they had a\r\nnumber of their branded hogs in it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATTLE\r\n\r\nNeat animals were kept near Jamestown in the early years, but they,\r\nlike the swine, had to gather their own living. A few were trained\r\nfor draft purposes. In new grounds where stumps and roots prevail,\r\noxen are more useful than horses. They do not get in a panic when\r\nobstacles interfere. Then too, they can be slaughtered for beef when\r\nthey become too old for work. During the period under study, cattle,\r\nin Virginia, often brought good prices. Many were purchased by the\r\nNew England colonists as it was cheaper to buy animals, in America,\r\nthan to go to the expense and loss of animals by shipping them across\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\nThere was a market for oxen in the Caribbean region, where they were\r\nused for power, in the sugar mills.\r\n\r\nIn the first thirty years, some of the cattle went wild in the back\r\ncountry, but many of the cows were kept in the vicinity of the\r\nJamestown headquarters. While not notable as dairy cows, they\r\nproduced enough milk so that Virginia gained a reputation among ship\r\ncrews for its excellent butter and cheese. In 1649 it was estimated\r\nthat there were twenty thousand cattle in the Colony.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOATS AND SHEEP\r\n\r\nFlocks of goats and sheep became noticeable to visitors about the\r\nmiddle of the century. Many were brought to Virginia. In the early\r\nyears the numbers killed by wolves made them unprofitable. Heavy\r\nbounties paid for wolf heads eventually reduced the depredations of\r\nthis predator until sheep and goats were fairly safe. As producers of\r\nmeat and wool for clothing sheep contributed to the general welfare\r\nof the colony. By 1649, the number of sheep was estimated at three\r\nthousand; and of goats at five thousand.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSES\r\n\r\nOf all the domestic animals brought from England to Jamestown in the\r\nearly days of the settlement, the most expensive to transport and the\r\nmost useless after they arrived in Virginia were horses. The estimate\r\nof the number in the Colony in 1649 is 200. There was no purpose for\r\nthem to serve. The fragile wooden plows of the seventeenth century\r\nwere of no use among the stumps and roots in newly cleared forest\r\nlands. Horses were of no value for transportation as there were no\r\nroads through the forests or bridges over the rivers. They were of\r\nlittle use as beasts of burden as there were few burdens to carry. A\r\nhorse was no match for an able-bodied man on Indian trails through\r\ntimbered country. As late as 1671, the Batts and Fallam expedition,\r\nconsisting of five white men and seven Indians, who were the\r\ndiscoverers of New River, had horses for the white men when they left\r\nPetersburg. All of these animals were dead before they reached the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nThe colonists did all they could afford to do with the horses brought\r\nto them and that was to turn them loose to shift for themselves. In a\r\nvery few years there was a band of wild horses roaming the woods in\r\nthe back country. Eventually these wild horses provided a great deal\r\nof recreation for the younger planters. Capturing and breaking to the\r\nsaddle wild horses became a popular sport. As soon as a horse was\r\ncaught and accustomed to a rider the most natural thing was to try it\r\nfor speed.\r\n\r\nHorse-racing began with local contests but developed into a major\r\nsport. King Charles II is credited with having imported Turk and\r\nArabian horses to England. Some of this blooded stock may have been\r\nshipped to Jamestown. At any rate Virginia saddle-horses at an early\r\ndate began to attract attention because of their speed.\r\n\r\nTwo other colonies, Rhode Island and New York were famous for their\r\nfast horses. Racing became an inter-colonial sport. The first regular\r\nrace course was the New Market on Hempstead Plains, Long Island.\r\nThere the fleetest horses of Long Island were brought together to\r\nsettle all arguments by actual trial. This famous race course was\r\ndescribed in 1670 by a contemporary, Daniel Denton: \"Toward the\r\nmiddle of Long Island lyeth a plain sixteen miles long and four\r\nbroad, upon which plain grows very fine grass, that makes exceeding\r\ngood hay, and is very good pasture for sheep or other cattel; where\r\nyou shall find neither stick nor stone to hinder the horse heels or\r\nendanger them in their races, and once a year the best horses in the\r\nisland are brought hither to try their swiftness, and the swiftest\r\nrewarded with a silver cup, two being annually procured for that\r\npurpose.\"\r\n\r\nHorse-racing became of economic importance to these colonies. The\r\nsugar planters, in the Caribbean region, also became interested in\r\nthis \"sport of kings\" and sent agents to buy the fastest horses they\r\ncould find. High prices were sometimes paid for prize winning\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nGovernor Francis Nicholson in 1690, \"gave prizes to those that should\r\nexcell in riding, running, wrestling and cudgeling.\" Of these sports,\r\nriding became by far the most popular. Interest in horse-racing,\r\nfox-chasing, steeple-chasing, and riding tournaments has never\r\nentirely died out in Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nA great deal has been written about the events that occurred during\r\nthe ninety-two years that elapsed, from the settlement of the colony\r\non Jamestown Island, and the change of capital site to Williamsburg.\r\nJudging from the recorded observations of visitors during that\r\nperiod, no great difference in the general appearance of the\r\nlandscape had taken place. It still looked very much like a\r\nwilderness. Much forest land had been cleared, farmed for a few\r\nyears, and then turned back to nature. The mammoth trees with scanty\r\nundergrowth, that the firstcomers found, had been replaced with a\r\nluxuriant second or third growth. If the top-soil is not eroded away\r\na new forest can be produced in Virginia in thirty or forty years.\r\n\r\nOne of the most noticeable improvements was in the dwelling houses.\r\nSubstantial brick and frame buildings had replaced the hurriedly\r\nconstructed shacks of the early days.\r\n\r\nThe accumulated wealth from the surplus products resulting from their\r\nfarming activities was reflected in their flocks and herds of horses,\r\ncattle, sheep, goats, swine, and poultry. Dire famine no longer\r\nstared them in face. Through insistence that only the best quality\r\nproducts should be shipped abroad, favorable trade relations had been\r\nestablished in the commerce of the world.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest achievement of all was the creation of the farm\r\nhome where a family could own, in fee simple, the land they tilled,\r\nlive in peace, and enjoy the fruits of their own labor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

The author, Gervase Markham, issued several editions of the\r\nwork. This extract is from the fourth edition, printed in 1638, of\r\nwhich a title-page is reproduced in this booklet, from the copy in\r\nthe William and Mary College Library. Markham's book has an\r\nadditional interest, for the reason that in the supplies sent by ship\r\n_Supply_ in 1620 to Berkeley Hundred, a copy of the current edition\r\nwas included.\r\n\r\n     Having thus generally runne over (in a short computation) the\r\n     labours of the husbandman, I will now briefly as I can, goe over\r\n     the particular daies labours of a farmer or plowman, shewing the\r\n     particular expence of every houre of the day, from his first\r\n     rising, till his going to bed, as thus for example: We will\r\n     suppose it to be after Christmas, and about plow-day (which is\r\n     the first letting out of the plough) and at what time men either\r\n     begin to fallow, or to break up pease earth, which is to lie to\r\n     bait, according to the custome of the country; at this time the\r\n     plough-man shall rise before foure of the clocke in the morning,\r\n     and after thankes given to God for his rest, and the successe of\r\n     his labours he shall go into his stable, or beaste-house, and\r\n     first he shall fodder his cattell, then cleanse the house, and\r\n     make the booths cleane, rub downe the cattell, and cleanse their\r\n     skins of all filth, then he shall curry his horses, rub them\r\n     with clothes and wisps, and make both them and the stable as\r\n     cleane as may be, then he shall water both his oxen and horses,\r\n     and housing them againe, give them more fodder, and to his horse\r\n     by all meanes provender, as chaffe and dry pease or beanes, or\r\n     oat-hulls, pease or beanes or cleane oates, or clean garbage\r\n     (which is the hinder ends of any kinde of graine but rye) with\r\n     the straw chop'd small amongst it, according as the ability of\r\n     the husbandman is. And whilst they are eating their meat, he\r\n     shall make ready his collars, hames, treats, halters, mullens,\r\n     and plough-geares, seeing everything fit, and in his due place,\r\n     and to these labours I will also allow full two houres, that is,\r\n     from foure of the clocke till sixe, then hee shall come in to\r\n     breakfast, and to that I allow him halfe an houre; and then\r\n     another halfe houre to the gearing and yoaking of his cattell,\r\n     so that at seven of the clocke hee may set forward to his\r\n     labour, and then he shall plow from seven of the clock in the\r\n     morning, till betwixt two and three in the afternoone, then he\r\n     shall unyoke, and bring home his cattell, and having rubb'd\r\n     them, drest them, and cleansed away all durt and filth, he shall\r\n     fodder them, and give them meate, then shall the servants goe in\r\n     to their dinner, which allowed halfe an houre; it will then be\r\n     towards foure of the clocke, at what time hee shall goe to his\r\n     cattell againe, and rubbing them downe, and cleansing their\r\n     stalls, give them more fodder, which done, he shall go into the\r\n     barnes, and provide and make ready fodder of all kinds for the\r\n     next day, whether it be hay, straw, or blend fodder, according\r\n     to the ability of the husbandman: this being done, and carried\r\n     into the stable, oxe-house, or other convenient place, he shall\r\n     then goe water his cattell, and give them more meate, and to his\r\n     horse provender, as before shewed; and by this time it will draw\r\n     past sixe of the clocke, at which time he shall come in to\r\n     supper, and after supper, he shall either by the fire side, mend\r\n     shooes both for himselfe and their family, or beat and knock\r\n     hemp, or flaxe, or picke and stampe apples, or crabs for cider\r\n     or verdjuce, or else grind malt on the quernes, picke candle\r\n     rushes, or do some husbandly office within dores, till it be\r\n     full eight a clocke: then shall he take his lanthorne and\r\n     candle, and goe to his cattell, and having cleansed the stalls\r\n     and plankes, litter them downe, looke that they be safely tied,\r\n     and then fodder and give them meate for all night, then giving\r\n     God thankes for benefits received that day, let him and the\r\n     whole household goe to their rest till the next morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nMARKHAMS\r\n\r\nFarewell to\r\n\r\nHVSBANDRY;\r\n\r\nOR,\r\n\r\nThe Enriching of all sorts of Barren and Steril grounds in our\r\nKingdome, to be as fruitfull in all manner of Graine, Pulse, and\r\nGrasse, as the best grounds whatsoever.\r\n\r\nTogether with the annoyances, and preservation of all Graine and\r\nSeed, from one yeare to many yeares.\r\n\r\nAs also a Husbandly computation of men and Cattels daily labours,\r\ntheir expeences, charges, and utmost profits.\r\n\r\nThe fourth time, revised, corrected, and amended, together with many\r\nnew Additions, and cheape experiments:\r\n\r\nFor the bettering of arable Pasture, and wooddy Grounds.

The term \"corn\"\r\nas used by Markham does not mean maize (Indian corn), but wheat,\r\nbarley, rye, or oats.\r\n\r\n     And first for transportation of graine by sea, it is two waies\r\n     to be done, as either in great quantities for trade and the\r\n     victuallyng of other nations, or in smaller quantity for\r\n     victualling the men in the ship, prepared for a long and tedious\r\n     voyage.\r\n\r\n     For the transporting of graine for trade in great quantities, it\r\n     is to be intended the voyage is seldom long, but from neighbor\r\n     to neighbor, and therefore commonly they make close decks in the\r\n     ships to receive the graine, faire and even boorded, yet if such\r\n     decks be matted and lined both under and on each side, it is\r\n     much the better, and this matting would be strong and thinne;\r\n     there bee some which make the decks only of mats, and sure it is\r\n     sweet, but not so strong as the boord, therefore the best way of\r\n     transportation is to have strong boorded deckes well matted, and\r\n     then spreading the corne of a reasonable thicknesse, to cover it\r\n     with matting againe, and then to lay corne on it againe, and\r\n     then mats againe, that betweene every reasonable thicknesse of\r\n     graine a mat may lie, the profit whereof is, that when the corne\r\n     with his owne heate and the working of the sea shall beginne to\r\n     sweate, which sweat for want of aire to drie it up, would turne\r\n     to putrifaction, then the mats thus lying betweene, will not\r\n     only exhale and sucke up the sweate, but also keep the corne so\r\n     coole and dry, that no imperfection shall come unto it: and here\r\n     is to be noted, that these mats should rather be made of dry\r\n     white bents, than of flagges and bulrush, for the bent is a\r\n     firme, dry, crispe thing, and will not relent or sweat of it\r\n     selfe, but the flag or bulrush is a spungy and soft substance\r\n     which is never empty of his own and other moystures.\r\n\r\n     Now for transporting of graine, for victualls for the ship,\r\n     which is in much smaller quantity, because it is best for the\r\n     private use of a few within the ship; the only best and safest\r\n     way, is, to take salt-fish barrells, or any caske in which any\r\n     salt-fish hath beene piled, as cod, herrings, salmon, sprats, or\r\n     any other powdred [_i.e._, _salted_] fish; and whilest the\r\n     vessels are sweet, you shall calke them both, within and\r\n     without, plaster [and] daubing them all over; then into them put\r\n     your graine of what kinde soever it be, and head them up close,\r\n     and then stow them in such convenient dry place of the ship, as\r\n     you shall thinke fit; and questionlesse, if beliefe may be given\r\n     to the worthiest authors, which hath writ in this kinde, you may\r\n     thus keepe your graine sweet, sound and in full perfection from\r\n     one yeere to an hundred and twenty yeers; but certainly daily\r\n     experience shows us, that all kind of graine thus put up and\r\n     kept, will remaine sound and sweet, three, foure, and as some\r\n     say, seven yeeres, for so far hath lately been try'd; and what\r\n     here I speake of [on] ship-boord, the like may be done in any\r\n     town of war or garrison, whether besieged, or not besieged, or\r\n     in any other place, where any necessity shall compell; the\r\n     proofe of this manner of piling or putting up of graine, serveth\r\n     as well for land as sea.",
