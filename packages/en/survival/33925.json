CECIL HUGHES, B.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n _With Illustrations of Fossils by\r\n MAUD NEAL_\r\n\r\n\r\n LONDON:\r\n\r\n EDWARD STANFORD, LIMITED\r\n 12, 13, & 14 LONG ACRE, W.C. 2.\r\n 1922\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nNo better district could be chosen to begin the study of Geology than\r\nthe Isle of Wight. The splendid coast sections all round its shores,\r\nthe variety of strata within so small an area, the great interest of\r\nthose strata, the white chalk cliffs and the coloured sands, the\r\nabundant and interesting fossils to be found in the rocks, awaken in\r\nnumbers of those who live in the Island, or visit its shores, a desire\r\nto know something of the story written in the rocks. The Isle of Wight\r\nis classic ground of Geology. From the early days of the science it\r\nhas been made famous by the work of great students of Nature, such as\r\nMantell, Buckland, Fitton, Sedgwick, Owen, Edward Forbes, and others,\r\nwho have carried on the study up to the present day. Many of the\r\nstrata are known to geologists everywhere as typical; several bear the\r\nnames of the Island localities, where they occur; some--and those not\r\nthe least interesting--are not found beyond the limits of the Island.\r\nThough studied for so many years, there is no exhausting their\r\ninterest: new discoveries are constantly made, and new questions arise\r\nfor solution. To those who have become interested in the rocks of the\r\nIsland, and the fossils they have found in them, and who wish to learn\r\nhow to read the story they tell, and to know something of that story,\r\nthis book is addressed. It is intended to be an introduction to the\r\nscience of Geology, based on the Geology of the Isle of Wight, yet\r\nleading on to some glimpse of the history presented to us, when we\r\ntake a wider outlook still, and try to trace the whole wondrous path\r\nof change from the world's beginning to the present day.\r\n\r\nI wish to express my warmest thanks to Miss Maud Neal for the\r\nbeautiful drawings of fossils which illustrate the book, and to\r\nProfessor Grenville A. J. Cole, F.R.S., for his kindness in reading\r\nthe manuscript, and for valuable suggestions received from him. I have\r\nalso to acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr. H. J. Osborne White's new\r\nedition of the _Memoir of the Geological Survey of the Isle of Wight_,\r\n1921; and to thank Mr. J. Milman Brown, of Shanklin, for the three\r\nphotographs of Island scenery, showing features of marked geological\r\ninterest, and Mr. C. E. Gilchrist, Librarian of the Sandown Free\r\nLibrary, for kindly reading the proofs of the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n J.

At almost any point of the coast of the Isle of Wight, in bands\r\nof limestone and beds of clay, in cliffs of sandstone or of chalk, we\r\nshall have no difficulty in finding numerous shells. But it is not\r\nonly in the rocks of the sea coast that shells are to be found. In\r\nquarries for building stone and in the chalk pits of the downs we see\r\nshells in the rock, and may often notice them in the stones of walls\r\nand buildings. How did they get there? The sea, we say, must once have\r\nbeen here. It must have flowed over the land at some time. Now let us\r\nthink. We are going to read a wonderful story, written not in books,\r\nbut in the rocks. And it will be much more valuable if we learn to\r\nread it ourselves, than if we are just told what other people have\r\nmade out. We know a thing much better if we see the answers to\r\nquestions for ourselves than if we are told the answers, and take some\r\none else's word for it. And if we learn to ask questions of Nature,\r\nand get answers to them, it will be useful in all sorts of ways all\r\nthrough life. Now, look at the shells in the rock of cliff and quarry.\r\nHow are they there? The sea cannot have just flowed over and left\r\nthem. The rock could not have been hard, as it is now, when they got\r\nin. Some of the rocks are sandstone, much like the sand on the sea\r\nshore, but they are harder, and their particles are stuck together.\r\nDoes sand on a sea shore ever become hard like rock, so that shells\r\nburied in it are found afterwards in hard rock? Now we are getting the\r\nkey to a secret. We are learning the way to read the story of the\r\nrocks. How? In this way. Look around you. See if anything like this is\r\nhappening to-day. Then you will be able to read the story of what\r\nhappened long, long ago, of how this world came to be as it is to-day.\r\nWe have asked a question about the sandstone. What about the clays and\r\nthe limestone? As before, what is happening to-day? Is limestone being\r\nmade anywhere to-day, and are shells being shut up in it? Are shells\r\nin the sea being covered up with clay,--with mud,--and more shellfish\r\nliving on the top of that; and then, are they, too, being covered up?\r\nSo that in years to come they will be found in layers of clay and\r\nstone like those we have been looking at in quarry and sea cliff?\r\n\r\nWe have asked our questions. Now we must look around, and see if we\r\ncan find the answers. After it has been raining heavily for two or\r\nthree days go down to the marshes of the Yar, and stand on one of the\r\nbridges over the stream. We have seen it flowing quite clear on some\r\ndays. Now it is yellow or brown with mud. Where did the mud come from?\r\nGo into a ploughed field with a ditch by the side. Down the ditch the\r\nrain water is pouring from the field away to the stream. It is thick\r\nwith mud. Off the ploughed field little trickles of water are running\r\ninto the ditch. Each brings earth from the field with it. Off all the\r\ncountry round the rain is trickling away, carrying earth into the\r\nditches and on into the stream, and the stream is carrying it down\r\ninto the sea. Now think. After every shower of rain earth is carried\r\noff the land into the sea. And this goes on all the year round, and\r\nyear after year. If it goes on long enough--? Look a long way ahead, a\r\nhundred years,--a thousand,--thousands of years. We shall be talking\r\nsoon of what takes many thousands of years to do. Why, you say, if it\r\ngoes on long enough, all the land will be carried into the sea. So it\r\nwill be. So it must be. You see how the world is changing. You will\r\nsoon see how it has changed already, what wonderful changes there have\r\nbeen. You will see that things have happened in the world which you\r\nnever guessed till you began to study Geology.\r\n\r\nNow, let us go a bit further. What becomes of all the mud the streams\r\nand rivers are carrying down into the sea? Look at a stream coming\r\nsteeply down from the hills. How it rushes along, rolling pebbles\r\nagainst one another, sweeping everything before it, clearing out its\r\nchannel, polishing the rocks, and carrying all it rubs off down\r\ntowards the sea. Now look at a river near its mouth in flat lowland\r\ncountry. It flows now much slower; and so it has not power to bear\r\nalong all the material it swept down from the hills. And so it drops\r\na great deal; it is always silting up its own channel, and in flood\r\ntime depositing fresh layers of mud on the flat meadow land,--the\r\nalluvial flat,--through which it generally flows in the last part of\r\nits course. But a good deal of sediment is carried by the river out to\r\nsea. The water of the river, moving slower as it enters the sea, has\r\nless and less power to sweep along its burden of sand and mud, and it\r\ndrops it on the sea bottom,--first the bigger coarser particles like\r\nthe sand, then the mud; farther out, the finer particles of mud drop\r\nto the bottom.\r\n\r\nDuring the exploring cruise of the _Challenger_, under the direction\r\nof Sir Wyville Thomson, in 1872-6, the most extensive exploration of\r\nthe depths of the sea that has been made up to the present time, it\r\nwas found that everything in the nature of gravel or sand was laid\r\ndown within a very few miles, only the finer muddy sediments being\r\ncarried as far as 20 to 50 miles from the land, the very finest of\r\nall, under most favourable conditions, rarely extending beyond 150,\r\nand never exceeding 300 miles from land into the deep ocean. So\r\ngradually layer after layer of sand and mud cover the sea bed round\r\nour coasts; and shells of cockles and periwinkles, of crabs and sea\r\nurchins, and other sea creatures that have lived on the bottom of the\r\nsea are buried in the growing layers of sand and mud. As layer forms\r\non layer, the lower layers are pressed together, and become more and\r\nmore solid. And so we have got a good way towards seeing the making of\r\nclay and sandstone with shells in them, such as we saw in the sea\r\ncliffs and the quarries.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only rain and rivers that are wearing the land away. All\r\nround the coasts the sea is doing the same work. We see the waves\r\nbeating against the shores, washing out the softer material, hollowing\r\ncaves into the cliffs, eating away by degrees even the hardest rock,\r\nleaving for a while at times isolated rocks like the Needles to mark\r\nthe former extension of the land. Most people see for themselves the\r\nwork of the sea, but do not notice so much what the rain and the\r\nfrost, the streams and the rivers are doing. But these are wearing\r\naway the ground over the whole country, while the sea is only eating\r\naway at the coast line. So the whole of the land is being worn away,\r\nand the sand and mud carried out into the sea, and deposited there,\r\nthe material of new land beneath the waters.\r\n\r\nHow do these beds rise up again, so that we find them with their sea\r\nshells in the quarry? Well, we look at the sea heaving up and down\r\nwith the tides, and we think of the land as firm and fixed. And yet\r\nthe land also is continually heaving up and down--very slowly,--far\r\ntoo slowly for it to be noticed, but none the less surely. The exact\r\ncauses of this are not yet well understood, because we know but little\r\nabout the inside of the earth. The deepest mine goes a very little\r\nway. We know that parts of the interior are intensely hot. The\r\ntemperature in a mine becomes hotter, about 1 deg.F. for every 60 ft. we go\r\ndown on the average. We know that there are great quantities of molten\r\nrock in places, which, in a volcanic eruption is poured out in sheets\r\nof lava over the land. There are great quantities of water turned into\r\nsteam by the heat, and in an eruption the steam pours out of the\r\ncrater of the volcano like the clouds of steam out of the funnel of a\r\nlocomotive. The people who live about a volcano are living, as it\r\nwere, on the top of the boiler of a steam engine; and their country is\r\nsometimes shaken up and down like the lid of a kettle by the escaping\r\nsteam. In such a country the land is often changing its level. A few\r\nmiles from Naples at Pozzuoli, the ancient Puteoli, may be seen\r\ncolumns of what appears to be an ancient market hall, though it goes\r\nby the name of the Temple of Serapis. About half way up the columns\r\nare holes bored by boring shellfish, such as we may find on the shore\r\nhere at low tide. We see from this that since the building was\r\nconstructed in Roman times the land has sunk, and carried the columns\r\ninto the sea, and shellfish have bored into them. Then the land has\r\nrisen, and lifted the columns out of the sea again.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only in the neighbourhood of volcanoes that the land is\r\nmoving. Not suddenly and violently, but slowly and gradually great\r\ntracts of land rise and sink. Sometimes the land may remain for a long\r\ntime nearly stationary. The Southern coasts of England seem to stand\r\nat much the same level as in the time of the Romans 1,500 or 2,000\r\nyears ago. On the other hand there is evidence which seems to show\r\nthat the coast of Norway has for some time been gradually rising.\r\n\r\nIt was thought at one time that the interior of the earth was liquid\r\nlike molten lava, and that the land we see was a comparatively thin\r\ncrust over this like the crust of a pie. But it is now believed for\r\nvarious mathematical reasons, that the main mass of the earth is rigid\r\nas steel. Still underneath the surface rocks there must be a quantity\r\nof semi-fluid matter, like molten rock, and on this the solid land\r\nsways about, as we see the ice on a pond sway with the pressure of the\r\nskaters on it. So the solid land, pressed by internal forces, rises\r\nand falls like the elastic ice, sometimes sinking and letting the sea\r\nflow over, then rising again, and bringing up the land from beneath\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nAgain, as the heated interior of the earth gradually cools by the\r\nradiation of the earth's heat into space, it will tend to shrink away\r\nfrom the cooler rocks of the crust. This then, sinking in upon the\r\nshrinking interior, will be thrown into folds, like the skin on a\r\nshrivelled apple. Seeing, as we often do, layers of rock thrown into\r\nnumerous folds, so as to occupy a horizontal space far less than that\r\nin which they were originally laid down, we can hardly resist the\r\nconclusion that shrinkage of the cooling interior of the earth has\r\nbeen a chief cause of the greatest movements of the surface, and of\r\nthe lateral pressure we so often find the strata to have undergone.\r\n\r\nAs we study geology we shall find plenty to show that the land does\r\nrise and fall, that where now is land the sea has been, that land once\r\nstretched where now is sea, though there is still much which is not\r\nwell understood about the causes of its movements. We have seen how\r\nmany of the rocks are made in the sea,--the sandstones and the\r\nclays,--but there are two other kinds of rocks, about which we must\r\nsay a little. The first are the Igneous rocks, which means rocks made\r\nby fire. These rocks have solidified, most frequently in crystalline\r\nforms, from a molten mass. Lava, which flows hot and fluid, from a\r\nvolcano, and cooling becomes a sheet of solid rock, is an igneous\r\nrock. Some igneous rocks solidify under ground under great pressure,\r\nand become crystalline rocks such as granite. We shall not find these\r\nrocks in the Isle of Wight. We should find them in Cornwall, Wales,\r\nand Scotland; and, if we could go deep enough, we should find some\r\nsuch rock as granite underneath the other rocks all the world over.\r\nThe other rocks, such as the sandstones and clays, are called\r\nSedimentary rocks, because they are formed of sediment, material\r\ncarried by the sea and rivers, and dropped to the bottom. They are\r\nalso called Stratified rocks, because they are formed of Strata,\r\n_i.e._, beds or layers, as we see in cliff and quarry.\r\n\r\nBut we have seen another kind of rock,--the limestones. In Sandown Bay\r\ntowards the Culvers, bands of limestone run through the dark clay\r\ncliffs, and broken fragments lie on the shore, looking like pieces of\r\npaving stone. Examining these we find that they are made up of shells,\r\none band of small oysters, the others of shells of other kinds. You\r\nsee how they have been made. There has been an oyster bed, and the\r\nshells have been pressed together, and somehow stuck together, so\r\nthat they have formed a layer of rock. They are stuck together in this\r\nway. The atmosphere contains a small quantity of carbonic dioxide, and\r\nthe soil a larger quantity, the result of vegetable decomposition.\r\nRain water absorbs some of it, and carries it into the rocks, as it\r\nsoaks into the ground. This gas has the property of combining with\r\ncarbonate of lime,--the material of which shells and limestone are\r\nmade. The bicarbonate of lime so formed is soluble in water, which is\r\nnot the case with the simple carbonate. Water containing carbonic\r\ndioxide soaking into a limestone rock or a mass of shells dissolves\r\nsome of the carbonate of lime, and carries it on with it. When it\r\ncomes to an open space containing air, some of the carbonic dioxide is\r\ngiven off, leaving the insoluble carbonate of lime again. So by\r\ndegrees the hollows are filled up, and a solid layer of rock is\r\nformed. Even while gathering in the sea the shell-fragments may be\r\ncemented by the deposit of carbonate of lime from sea-water containing\r\nmore of the soluble bicarbonate than it can hold.\r\n\r\nThese limestones are examples of rocks which are said to be of organic\r\norigin, that is to say, they are formed by living things. Organic\r\nrocks may be formed by animal or vegetable growth. Rocks of vegetable\r\norigin are seen in the coals. A peat bog is composed of a mass of\r\nvegetable matter, chiefly bog moss, which for centuries has been\r\ngrowing and accumulating on the spot. At the bottom of the bog will\r\nfrequently be found trunks of oak, or other trees, the remains of a\r\nforest of former days. The wood has undergone chemical changes, has\r\nlost much of its moisture, and often become very hard, as in bog oak.\r\nBeds of coal have been formed by a similar process, on a much vaster\r\nscale, and continued much longer. The remains of ancient forests have\r\nbeen buried under sand stones and other rocks, have undergone chemical\r\nchange, and been compressed into the hard solid mass we call coal.\r\nFossil wood, which has not reached the stage of hard coal, but forms a\r\nsoft brown substance, is called lignite. This is of frequent\r\noccurrence in various strata in the Isle of Wight.\r\n\r\nOf organic rocks of animal origin the most remarkable are the chalk,\r\nof which we shall speak later, and the coral-reefs, which are found in\r\nthe warm waters of tropical seas. Sailing over the South Pacific you\r\nwill see a line of trees--coconut trees chiefly--looking as if they\r\nrose up from the sea. Coming nearer you see that they grow on a low\r\nisland, which rises only a few feet above the water. These islands are\r\noften in the form of a ring, and look \"like garlands thrown upon the\r\nwaters.\" Inside the ring is a lagoon of calm water. Outside the heavy\r\nswell of the Southern Ocean thunders on the coral shore. If a sounding\r\nline be let down from the outer edge of the reef, it will be found\r\nthat the wall of coral goes down hundreds of feet like a precipice. On\r\nan island in the Southern Sea, Funafuti, a deep boring has been made\r\n1,114 ft. deep. As far as the boring went all was coral. All this mass\r\nof coral is formed by living things,--polyps they are called. They are\r\nlike tiny sea anemones, only they grow attached to one another,\r\nforming a compound animal, like a tree with stem and branches, and\r\nlittle sea anemones for flowers. The whole organism has a sort of\r\nshell or skeleton, which is the coral. Blocks are broken off by the\r\nwaves, and ground to a coral mud, which fills up the interstices of\r\nthe coral; and as more coral grows above, the lower part of the reef\r\nbecomes, by pressure and cementing, a solid coral limestone. Once upon\r\na time there were coral islands forming in a sea, where now is\r\nEngland. These old coral reefs form beds of limestone in Devon,\r\nDerbyshire, and other parts of England. In the Isle of Wight we have\r\nno old coral reefs, but we shall easily find fossil corals in the\r\nrocks. They helped to make up the rocks, but there were not enough\r\nhere to make reefs or islands all of coral.\r\n\r\nThe great branching corals that form the reefs can only live in warm\r\nwaters. So we see that when corals were forming reefs where now is\r\nEngland the climate must have been warm like the tropics. That is a\r\nstory we shall often read as we come to hear more about the rocks. We\r\nshall find that the climate has often been quite warm as the tropics\r\nare now: and we shall also read another wonderful story of a time when\r\nthe climate was cold like the Arctic regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II.\r\n\r\nTHE STRUCTURE OF THE ISLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best place to begin the study of the Geology of the Isle of Wight\r\nis in Sandown Bay. North of Sandown, beyond the flat of the marshes,\r\nare low cliffs of reddish clay, which has slipped in places, and is\r\nmuch covered by grass. At low tide we shall see the coloured clays on\r\nthe shore, unless the sand has covered them up. Variegated marls they\r\nare called--_marl_ means a limy clay, _loam_ a sandy clay; and very\r\nfine are the colours of these marls, rich reds and purples and browns.\r\nBeyond the little sea wall below Yaverland battery we come to a\r\ndifferent kind of clay forming the cliff. It is in thin layers. Clay\r\nin thin layers like this is called _shale_. Some of these shales are\r\nknown as paper shales, for the layers are thin almost like the leaves\r\nof a book. The junction of the shales with the marls is quite sharp,\r\nand we see that the shales rest on the coloured marls, not\r\nhorizontally, but sloping down towards the North. Bands of limestone\r\nand sandstone running through the shales, and a hard band of brown\r\nrock which runs out on the shore as a reef, slope in the same\r\ndirection. As we pass on by the Red Cliff to the White Cliffs we\r\nnotice that the strata slope more steeply the further North we go. We\r\nhave seen that these strata were laid down layer by layer at the\r\nbottom of the sea. If we find a lot of things lying one on top of\r\nanother, we may generally conclude that the ones at the bottom were\r\nput there first, then the next, and so on to the top. And this will\r\ngenerally be true with regard to the rocks. The lowest rocks must have\r\nbeen laid down first, then the next, and so on. But these layers of\r\nshale with shells in them, and layers of limestone made of shells,\r\nmust have been laid down at first fairly flat on the sea floor; but as\r\nthey were upheaved out of the sea they have been tilted, so that we\r\nnow see them in an inclined position. And when we come to the chalk,\r\nwe should see, if we looked at the end of the Culver Cliffs from a\r\nboat, that the lines of black flints that run through the chalk are\r\nnearly vertical. The strata there have been tilted up on end.\r\n\r\n\r\n [Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n DIAGRAM OF COAST, SANDOWN BAY, DUNNOSE TO CULVER CLIFF.\r\n\r\n W    _Wealden._\r\n P    _Perna Bed._\r\n LG   _Lower Greensand._\r\n Cb   _Clay Bands._\r\n S    _Sandrock and Carstone._\r\n g    _Gault._\r\n UG   _Upper Greensand._\r\n C    _Chalk._\r\n Sc   _Shanklin Chine._\r\n Lc   _Luccombe Chine._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn describing how strata lie, we call the inclination of the strata\r\nfrom the horizontal the _dip_. The direction of a horizontal line at\r\nright angles to that of the dip is called the _strike_. If we compare\r\nthe sloping strata to the roof of a house, a line down the slope of\r\nthe roof will mark the direction of the dip, the ridge of the roof\r\nthat of the strike. The strata we are considering dip towards the\r\nNorth; the line of strike is East and West.\r\n\r\nReturning towards Sandown we see the strata dipping less and less\r\nsteeply, till near the Granite Fort the rocks on the shore are\r\nhorizontal. Continuing our walk past Sandown to Shanklin we pass the\r\nsame succession of rocks we have been looking at, but in reverse\r\norder, and sloping the other way. It is not very easy to see this at\r\nfirst, for so much is covered by building; but beyond Sandown we see\r\nSandstone Cliffs like the Red Cliff again, the strata dipping gently\r\nnow to the south, and in the downs above Shanklin we see the chalk\r\nagain. So we have the same strata north and south of Sandown, forming\r\na sort of arch. But the centre of the arch is missing. It must have\r\nbeen cut away. We saw that the land was all being eaten away by rain\r\nand rivers. Now we see what they have done here. Go up on to the\r\nDowns, and look over the central part of the Island. We see two ranges\r\nof downs running from east to west,--the Central Downs of the Island,\r\na long line of chalk down 24 miles from the Culver Cliff on the east\r\nto the Needles on the west; and the Southern Downs along the South\r\nCoast from Shanklin to Chale. In the Central Downs the chalk rises\r\nnearly vertically, and turns over in the beginning of an arch towards\r\nthe South. Then comes a big gap, and the chalk appears again in the\r\nSouthern Downs nearly horizontal, sloping gently to the south. The\r\nchalk was once joined right across the central hollow, where now we\r\nsee the villages of Newchurch, Godshill, and Arreton. All that\r\nenormous mass of rock that once filled the space between the downs has\r\nbeen cut away by running water.\r\n\r\nAn arch of strata like this [Inverted-U], such as the one we are looking\r\nat, is called an _anticline_. When the arch is reversed, like this [U],\r\nit is called a _syncline_. Looking north from the Central Downs over the\r\nSolent we are looking at a syncline. The chalk, which dips down at the\r\nCulvers and along the line of the Central Downs, runs like a trough\r\nunder the Solent, and rises again, as we see it on the other side, in\r\nthe Portsdown Hills.\r\n\r\nWe might suppose the top of an anticlinal arch would be the highest\r\npart of the country; that, even if rain and running water have worn\r\nthe country down, that would still stand highest, and be worn down\r\nleast. But there are reasons why this need not be so. For one thing,\r\nwhen the horizontal strata are curved over into an arch, they\r\nnaturally crack just at the top of the curve, so and into the cracks\r\nthe rain gets, and so a stream is started there, which cuts down and\r\nwidens its channel, and so eats the land away. Again, the rising land\r\nonly emerges gradually from the sea, and the sea may cut off the top\r\nof the arch before it has risen out of its reach. Moreover on the\r\nhigher land the fall of rain and snow is greater, and the frosts are\r\nmore severe; so that it is just there that the forces wearing down the\r\nland are most effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n [Illustration: curve with two v-shaped marks at center]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must notice another thing which happens when rocks are being\r\nupheaved and bent into curves. The strain is very great, and sometimes\r\nthe strata crack and one side is pushed up more than the other. These\r\ncracks are called _faults_. At Little Stairs, about half way between\r\nSandown and Shanklin, two or three faults may be seen in the cliff.\r\nThe effect of two of the faults may be easily seen by noticing the\r\ndisplacement of a band of rock stained orange by water containing\r\niron. The strata are thrown down towards the north about 8 ft. A third\r\nfault, the effect of which is not so evident at first sight, throws\r\nthe strata down roughly 50 ft. to the south. These are only small\r\nfaults, but sometimes faults occur, in which the strata have been\r\nmoved on opposite sides of the fault thousands of feet away from one\r\nanother. We might think we should see a wall of rock rising up on the\r\nsurface of the ground where a fault occurs; but the faults have mostly\r\ntaken place ages ago; and, when they do happen, the rocks are\r\ngenerally moved only a little way at a time. Then after a while\r\nanother push comes on the rocks, and they shift again at the same\r\nplace, and go a bit further. All this time frost and rain and rivers\r\nare working at the surface, and planing it down; so that the\r\nunevenness of the surface caused by faults is smoothed away; and so\r\neven a great fault does not show at the surface.\r\n\r\nAs we follow the Sandown anticline westward it gradually dies away,\r\nthe upheaved area being actually a long oval--what we may call a\r\nturtle-back. As the Sandown anticline dies out, it is succeeded by\r\nanother a little further south, the Brook anticline. There are in fact\r\na series of these east and west anticlines in the Island and on the\r\nadjacent mainland, caused by the same earth movement. As a consequence\r\nof the arching of the strata we find the lowest beds we saw in Sandown\r\nBay running out again on the west of the Island in Brook Bay, and a\r\ngeneral correspondence of the strata on the east and west of the\r\nIsland; while, as we travel from Sandown or Brook northward to the\r\nSolent, we come to continually more recent beds overlying those which\r\nappear to the south of them.\r\n\r\nWhen, as in the south side of our central downs, the strata are\r\nsharply cut away by denudation, we call this an _escarpment_. The\r\nfigure shows the structure of the Sandown anticline we have described.\r\nWe must now examine the rocks more closely, beginning with the lowest\r\nstrata in the Island, and try to read the story they have to tell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\n\r\nTHE WEALDEN STRATA: THE LAND OF THE IGUANODON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lowest strata in the Isle of Wight are the coloured marls and\r\nblue-grey shales we have already observed in Sandown Bay, which run\r\nthrough the Island to Brook Bay. They are known as the Wealden Strata,\r\nbecause the same strata cover the part of Kent and Sussex called the\r\nWeald. They consist of marls and shales with bands of sandstone and\r\nlimestone. The marls and shales in wet weather become very soft, and\r\nflow out on to the shore, causing large slips of land.[1] Now, what we\r\nwant to find out is what the world was like ages ago, when these\r\nWealden Strata were being formed. We have learnt something of how\r\nclays and sandstones and limestones are formed: to learn more we must\r\nsee what sort of fossils we can find in these rocks. \"Fossil\" means\r\nsomething dug up; and the word is generally used for remains of\r\nanimals or plants which we find buried in the rocks. We have seen\r\nshells in these strata. These we must examine more closely. And as we\r\nwalk on the shore we shall find other fossils. In the marls and shales\r\nexposed on the shore we are pretty sure to see pieces of wood, black\r\nas coal, sometimes quite large logs, often partly covered with shining\r\niron pyrites. Perhaps you say--I hope you do--there must have been\r\nland not far away when these marls and shales were forming. Always try\r\nto see what the things we find have to tell us. The sort of place\r\nwhere we should be most likely to find wood floating in the sea to-day\r\nwould be near the mouth of a great river like the Mississippi or the\r\nAmazon,--rivers which bring down numerous logs of wood from the forest\r\ncountry through which they flow.\r\n\r\nExamine the shales and limestone bands. On the surface of some of the\r\npaper-shales are numbers of small round or oval white spots. They are\r\nthe remains of shells of a very minute crustacean, Cypris and\r\nCypridea, from which the shales are known as Cyprid shales. In other\r\nbands of shale are quantities of a bivalve shell called _Cyrena_.\r\nThere is a band of limestone made up of Cyrena shells, containing also\r\nlittle roundish spiral shells called _Paludina_.[2] This limestone\r\nresembles that called Sussex or Petworth Marble, which is mainly\r\ncomposed of shells of Paludina, but some layers also contain bivalve\r\nshells. It is hard enough to take a good polish, and may be seen, like\r\nthe similar Purbeck marble, in some of our grand old churches. Another\r\nband of limestone running through the shales is made up of small\r\noysters (_Ostrea distorta_).\r\n\r\nWe shall see fossil shells best on the _weathered_ surfaces of rocks,\r\n_i.e._, surfaces which have been exposed to the weather. One\r\nbeginning geological study will probably think we shall find fossils\r\nbest by looking at fresh broken surfaces of rock. This is not so. If\r\nyou want to find fossils, look at the rock where it has been exposed\r\nto the weather. The action of the weather--rain, carbonic dioxide in\r\nthe rain water, etc.--is to sculpture the surface of the rock, so that\r\nthe fossils stand out in relief. A weathered surface is often seen\r\ncovered with fossils, when a new broken one shows none at all.\r\n\r\nMany of the shells in the limestones are very like shells which are\r\nfound at the present day. We must know where they are found now. Well,\r\nthese Paludinas are a kind of freshwater snail; and, in fact, all the\r\nshells we find in the Wealden strata are freshwater shells, till we\r\ncome near the top, and find the oysters, which live in salt or\r\nbrackish water. There were quantities in Brading Harbour in old days,\r\nbefore it was reclaimed from the sea. Now, this is a very important\r\npoint, that our Wealden shells are freshwater shells. For what does it\r\ntell us? Why, we see that the first strata we have come to examine\r\nwere not laid down in the sea at all. Then where were they formed?\r\nThey seem to be the Delta of a great river, long since passed away,\r\nlike the Nile, the Amazon, or the Niger at the present day. When these\r\ngreat rivers near the sea, they spread out in many channels, and\r\ndeposit the mud they have brought down over a wide area shaped like a\r\nV, or like the Greek letter $Delta$ (Delta). Hence we speak of the\r\nDelta of the Nile. Some river deltas are of immense size. That of the\r\nNiger, for instance, is 170 miles long, and the line where it meets\r\nthe sea is 300 miles long. Our old Wealden river must have been a\r\ngreat river like the Niger, for the Wealden strata stretch,--often\r\ncovered up for a long way by later rocks, then appearing again,--as\r\nfar as Lulworth on the Dorset coast to the west, into Buckinghamshire\r\non the north, while to the north east they not only cover the Weald,\r\nbut pass under the Straits of Dover into Belgium, and very similar\r\nstrata are found in Westphalia and Hanover. The ancient river delta\r\nmust have been 200 miles or more across.\r\n\r\nYou must not think this great river flowed in the Island of England as\r\nit is to-day. England was being made then. This must have been part of\r\na great continent in those days, for such a great river to flow\r\nthrough, and form a delta of such size. We cannot tell quite what was\r\nthe course of this river. But to the north of where we are now must\r\nhave stretched a great continent, with chains of lofty mountains far\r\naway, from which the head waters of the river flowed. Near its mouth\r\nthe river broke up into many streams, separated by marsh land; while\r\ninside the sand banks of the sea shore would be large lagoons as in\r\nthe Nile delta at the present day. In these waters lived the shellfish\r\nwhose shells we are finding. And flowing through great forests the\r\nriver carried down with it logs of wood and whole trees, and left them\r\nstuck in the mud near its mouths for us to find to-day.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of trees grew in the country the river came from? Well,\r\nthere were no oaks or beeches, no flowering chestnuts or apples or\r\nmays. But there were great forests of coniferous trees; that is trees\r\nlike our pines and firs, cedars and yews, and araucarias; and there\r\nwere cycads--a very different kind of tree, but also bearing\r\ncones--which you may see in a greenhouse in botanical gardens. They\r\nhave usually a short trunk, sometimes nearly hemispherical, with\r\nleaves like the long leaves of a date palm. They are sometimes called\r\nsago trees, for the trunk has a large pith, which, like some palms,\r\ngives us sago. Stems of cycads, covered with diamond-shaped scars,\r\nwhere the leaf stalks have dropped off, are found in the Wealden\r\ndeposits. Most of the wood we find is black and brittle. Some,\r\nhowever, is hard as stone, where the actual substance of the wood has\r\nbeen replaced by silica, preserving beautifully the structure of the\r\nwood. Specially noteworthy are fragments of a tree called\r\n_Endogenites_ (or _Tempskya_) _erosa_, because it was at first\r\nsupposed to belong to the endogens,--the class to which the palm\r\nbamboo belong; it is now considered to be a tree-fern. Many specimens\r\nof this wood are remarkably beautiful, when polished, or in their\r\nnatural condition. Here, by the way, it may be well to explain how we\r\nname animals and plants scientifically. We have English names only for\r\nthe commoner varieties. So we have to invent names for the greater\r\nnumber of living and extinct animals and plants. And the best way is\r\nfound to be this. We give a name, generally formed from the Latin--or\r\nthe Greek--to a group of animals or plants, which closely resemble one\r\nanother; the group we call a _genus_. Then for the _species_, the\r\nparticular kind of animal or plant of the group, we add a second name\r\nto the first. Thus, if we are studying the apple and pear group of\r\nfruit trees, we call the general name of the group _Pyrus_. Then the\r\ncrab apple is _Pyrus malus_, the wild pear _P. communis_, and so on.\r\nSo that when you arrange any of your species, and put down the\r\nscientific names, you are really doing a bit of classification as\r\nwell. You are arranging your specimens with their nearest relations.\r\n\r\nTo return to our ancient river. With the logs and trunks of trees,\r\nwhich the river brought down, came floating down also the bodies of\r\nanimals, which had lived in the country the river flowed through. What\r\nkind of animals? Very wonderful animals, some of them, not like any\r\nliving creature that lives to-day. By the time they reached the mouth\r\nof the river the bodies had come to pieces, and their bones were\r\nscattered about the river mouth. On the shore where we are walking we\r\nmay find some of these bones. But it is rather a chance whether we\r\nfind any in any one walk we take. The best time to find them is when\r\nrough seas in winter have washed some out of the clay, and left them\r\non the shore. It is only rarely that large bones are found here; but\r\nyou should be able to find some small ones fairly often. The bones are\r\nquite as heavy as stone, for all the pores and cavities have been\r\nfilled with stone, generally carbonate of lime, in the way we\r\nexplained in describing the formation of beds of limestone. This makes\r\nthem quite different from any present-day bones that may happen to lie\r\non the shore. So that you cannot mistake them, if once you have seen\r\nthem. They are bones of great reptiles,--the class of creatures to\r\nwhich lizards and crocodiles belong. But these were much larger than\r\ncrocodiles, and quite peculiar in their appearance. The principal one\r\nwas the Iguanodon. He stood on his hind legs like a kangaroo, with a\r\ngreat thick tail, which may have helped to support him. When full\r\ngrown he stood about 14 ft. high. You may find on the shore vertebrae,\r\n_i.e._, joints of the backbone, sometimes large, sometimes quite small\r\nif they come from the end of the tail. I have found several here about\r\n5 inches long by 4 or 5 across. A few years ago I found the end of a\r\nleg bone almost a foot in diameter. Dr. Mantell, a great geological\r\nexplorer in the days when these reptiles were first discovered about\r\n80 years ago, estimated from the size of part of a bone found in\r\nSandown Bay that one of these reptiles must have had a leg 9 ft. long.\r\nIt was a long time after the bones of these creatures were first found\r\nbefore it was known what they really looked like. The animals lived a\r\nlong way from here, and by the time the river had washed them down to\r\nits mouth the skeletons were broken up, and the bones scattered. At\r\nlast a discovery was made, which told us what the animals were like.\r\nIn a coal mine at Bernissart in Belgium the miners found the coal seam\r\nthey were following suddenly come to an end, and they got into a mass\r\nof clay. After a while it was seen what had happened. They had struck\r\nthe buried channel of an old river, which in the Wealden days had\r\nflowed through and cut its channel in the coal strata, which are much\r\nolder still than the Wealden. And in the mud of the ancient buried\r\nriver what should they come upon but whole skeletons of Iguanodons. In\r\nthe days of long ago the great beasts had come down to the river to\r\ndrink, and had got \"bogged\" in the soft clay. The skeletons were\r\ncarefully got out, and set up in the Museum at Brussels. Without going\r\nso far as that, you may see in the Natural History Museum in London,\r\nor the Geological Museum at Oxford, a facsimile of one of these\r\nskeletons, large as life, and have some idea of the sort of beast the\r\nIguanodon was. I should tell you why he was so named. Before it was\r\nknown what he was like in general form, it was found that his teeth,\r\nwhich are of a remarkable character, were similar to those of the\r\nIguana, a little lizard of the West Indies. So he was called\r\nIguanodon,--an animal with teeth like the Iguana (fr. _Iguana_, and\r\nGk. $odous$ g. $odontos$ a tooth). He was quite a harmless beast,\r\nthough he was so large. He was a vegetarian. There were other great\r\nreptiles, more or less like him, which were also vegetable feeders.\r\nBut there were also carnivorous reptiles, generally smaller than the\r\nherbivorous, whose teeth tell us that they preyed on other animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: PL. I]\r\n\r\n Perna Mulleti     Meyeria Vectensis\r\n                   (Atherfield Lobster)\r\n\r\n Panopaea Plicata   Terebratula Sella\r\n\r\n Cyrena Limestone  Iguanodon Vertebra\r\n\r\n     WEALDEN AND LOWER GREENSAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThose were the days of reptiles. Now the earth is the domain of the\r\nmammalia. But then great reptiles like the Iguanodon wandered over the\r\nland; great marine reptiles, such as the Plesiosaurus, swam the\r\nwaters; and wonderful flying reptiles, the Pterodactyls, flew the air.\r\nSome species of these were quite small, the size of a rook: one large\r\nspecies found in the Isle of Wight had a spread of wing of 16 feet.\r\nImagine this strange world,--its forests with pines and monkey puzzles\r\nand cycads,--ferns also, of which many fragments are found,--its great\r\nreptiles and little reptiles, on land, in the water and the air. Were\r\nthere no birds? Yes, but they were rare. From remains found in Oolitic\r\nstrata,--somewhat older than the Wealden,--we know that birds were\r\nalready in existence; and they were as strange as anything else. For\r\nthey had jaws with teeth like the reptiles. They had not yet adopted\r\nthe beak. And instead of all the tail feathers starting from one\r\npoint, as in birds of the present day, these ancient birds had long\r\ncurving tails like reptiles, with a pair of feathers on each joint.\r\nBirds of similar but slightly more modern type have been found in\r\nCretaceous strata (to which the Wealden belongs) in America, but so\r\nfar not in strata of this age in Britain.\r\n\r\nAmong other objects of interest along this Wealden shore may be\r\nnoticed a curious transformation which has affected the surface of\r\nsome of the shell limestones after they were formed, which is known as\r\ncone-in-cone structure. It has quite altered the outer layer of the\r\nrock, so that all trace of the shells of which it consists is\r\nobliterated. Numerous pieces of iron ore from various strata lie on\r\nthe shore. Through most of English history the Weald of Kent and\r\nSussex was the great iron-working district of England. The ore from\r\nthe Wealden strata was smelted by the help of charcoal made from the\r\nwoods that grew there, and gave the district its name;--for _Weald_\r\nmeans \"forest.\" This industry gradually ceased, as the much larger\r\nsupplies of iron ore found near the coal in the mines of the North of\r\nEngland came to be worked. Iron pyrites, sulphide of iron in\r\ncrystalline form, was formerly collected on the Sandown shore, and\r\nsent to London for the manufacture of sulphuric acid. This mineral is\r\noften found encrusting fossil wood. It also occurs as rounded nodules\r\n(mostly derived from the Lower Chalk) with a brown outer coat, and\r\noften showing a beautiful radiated metallic structure, when broken.\r\n(This form is called marcasite.)\r\n\r\nAs we walk by the edge of the water, we shall see what pretty stones\r\nlie along the beach. When wet with the ripples many look like polished\r\njewels. Some are agates, bright purple and orange in colour, some\r\nclear translucent chaldedony. We shall have more to say about these\r\nlater on. They do not come from the Wealden, but from beds of flint\r\ngravel, and are washed along the shore. But there are also jaspers\r\nfrom the Wealden. These are opaque, generally red and yellow. There\r\nare also pieces of variegated quartz, and other beautiful pebbles of\r\nvarious mineral composition. These are stones from older rocks, which\r\nhave been washed down the Wealden rivers, and buried in the Wealden\r\nstrata, to be washed out again after hundreds of thousands of years,\r\nand rolled about on the shore on which we walk to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Blue clays of various geological age, which in wet\r\n    weather become semi-liquid, and flow out on to the shore, are\r\n    known in the Island by the local name of _Blue Slipper_.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: The name now adopted is _Viviparus_. There is also\r\n    a band of ferruginous limestone mainly composed of _Viviparus_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: PL.

The land was gradually sinking; for\r\ncontinually strata of river mud were laid down over the same area, all\r\nshallow-water strata, yet counting hundreds of feet in thickness in\r\nall. At last a change came. The land sank more rapidly, and in over\r\nthe delta the sea water flowed. The sign of coming change is seen in\r\nthe limestone band made up of small oysters near the top of the\r\nWealden strata. Marine life was beginning to appear.\r\n\r\nAbove the Wealden shales in Sandown Bay may be seen a band of brown\r\nrock. It is in places much covered by slip, but big blocks lie about\r\nthe shore, and it runs out to sea as a reef before we come to the Red\r\nCliff. The blocks are seen to consist of a hard grey stone, but the\r\nweathered surfaces are soft and brown. They are full of fossils, all\r\nmarine, sea shells and corals. The sea has washed in well over our\r\nWealden delta, and with this bed the next formation, the Lower\r\nGreensand, begins. The bed is called the Perna bed, from a large\r\nbivalve shell (_Perna mulleti_) frequently to be found in it, though\r\nit is difficult to obtain perfect specimens showing the long hinge of\r\nthe valve, which is a marked feature of the shell. Among other shells\r\nare a large round bivalve _Corbis_ (_Sphaera_) _corrugata_, a flatter\r\nbivalve _Astarte_,--and a smaller oblong shell _Panopaea_,--also a\r\npeculiar shell of triangular form, _Trigonia_,--one species _T.\r\ncaudata_ has raised ribs running across it, another _T. daedalea_ has\r\nbands of raised spots. A pretty little coral, looking like a\r\ncollection of little stars, _Holocystis elegans_, one of the Astraeidae,\r\nis often very sharply weathered out.\r\n\r\nAbove the Perna bed lies a mass of blue clay, weathering brown, called\r\nthe Atherfield clay, because it appears on a great scale at Atherfield\r\non the south west of the Island. It is very like the clay of the\r\nWealden shales, but is not divided into thin layers like shale.\r\n\r\nNext we come to the fine mass of red sandstone which forms the\r\nvertical wall of Red Cliff. Not many fossils are to be found in these\r\nstrata. Let us note the beauty of colouring of the Red Cliff--pink and\r\ngreen, rich orange and purple reds. And then let us pass to the other\r\nside of the anticline, and walk on the shore to Shanklin. Here we see\r\nthe red sandstone rocks again, but now dipping to the south. You\r\nprobably wonder why these red cliffs are called Greensand. But look at\r\nthe rocks where they run out as ledges on the shore towards Shanklin.\r\nHere they are dark green. And this is really their natural colour.\r\nThey are made of a mixture of sand and clay coloured dark green by a\r\nmineral called glauconite. Grains of glauconite can easily be seen in\r\na handful of sand,--better with a magnifying glass. This mineral is a\r\ncompound of iron, with silica and potash, and at the surface of the\r\nrock it is altered chemically, and oxide of iron is formed--the same\r\nthing as rust. And that colours all the face of the cliff red. The\r\niron is also largely responsible for our finding so few fossils in\r\nthese strata. By chemical changes, in which the iron takes part, the\r\nmaterial of the shells is destroyed.[3] Near Little Stairs hollows in\r\nthe rock may be seen, where large oyster shells have been. In some you\r\nmay find a broken piece of shell, but the shells have been mostly\r\ndestroyed. Nearer Shanklin we shall find large oysters, _Exogyra\r\nsinuata_, in the rock ledges exposed at low tide. Some are stuck\r\ntogether in masses. Evidently there was an oyster bank here. And here\r\nthe shells have not been destroyed like those in the cliff.\r\n\r\nFrom black bands in the cliff water full of iron oozes out, staining\r\nthe cliff red and yellow and orange, and trickling down, stains the\r\nflint stones lying on the shore a bright orange. At the foot of the\r\ncliff you may sometimes see what looks like a bed of conglomerate,\r\n_i.e._, a bed of rounded pebbles cemented together. This does not\r\nbelong to the cliff, but is made up of the flint pebbles on the shore,\r\nand the sand in which they lie, cemented into a solid mass by the iron\r\nin the water which has flowed from the cliff. It is a modern\r\nconglomerate, and shows us how old conglomerates were formed, which we\r\noften find in the various strata. The cement, however, in these is not\r\nalways iron oxide. It may be siliceous or of other material. The\r\niron-charged water is called chalybeate; springs at Shanklin and Niton\r\nat one time had some fame for their strengthening powers. The strata\r\nwe have been examining are known as the Ferruginous sands, _i.e._,\r\niron sands (Lat. _ferrum_, \"iron\"). Beyond Shanklin is a fine piece of\r\ncliff. Look up at it, but beware of going too close under it. The\r\nupper part consists of a fine yellow sand called the Sandrock. At the\r\nbase of this are two bands of dark clay. These bands become filled\r\nwith water, and flow out, causing the sandrock which rests on them to\r\nbreak away in large masses, and fall on to the beach.\r\n\r\nIt is clay bands such as these which are the cause of our Undercliffs\r\nin the Isle of Wight. Turn the point, and you see exactly how an\r\nundercliff is formed. You see a wide platform at the level of the\r\nclay, which has slipped out, and let down the sandrock which rested on\r\nit. Beyond Luccombe Chine a large landslip took place in 1910, a great\r\nmass of cliff breaking away, and leaving a ravine behind partly filled\r\nwith fallen pine trees. The whole fallen mass has since sunk lower and\r\nnearer to the sea. The broken ground overgrown with trees called the\r\nLandslip, as well as the whole extent of the ground from Ventnor and\r\nNiton, has been formed in a similar way. But the clay which by its\r\nslip has produced these is another clay called the Gault, higher up in\r\nthe strata. At the top of the high cliff near Luccombe Chine a hard\r\ngritty stratum of rock called the Carstone is seen above the Sandrock,\r\nand above it lies the Gault clay, which flows over the edge of the\r\ncliff.\r\n\r\nIn the rock ledges and fallen blocks of stone between Shanklin and\r\nLuccombe many more fossils may be found than in the lower part of the\r\nFerruginous sands. Besides bands of oysters, blocks of stone are to be\r\nfound crowded with a pretty little shell called _Rhynchonella_. There\r\nare others with many _Terebratulae_, and others with fragments of sea\r\nurchins. The Terebratulae and Rhynchonellae belong to a curious group\r\nof shells, the Brachiopods, which are placed in a class distinct from\r\nthe Mollusca proper. They were very common in the very ancient seas of\r\nthe Cambrian period,--the period of the most ancient fossils yet\r\nfound,--and some, the Lingulae, have lived on almost unchanged to the\r\npresent day. One of the two valves is larger than the other, and near\r\nthe smaller end you will see a little round hole. Out of this hole,\r\nwhen the creature was alive, came a sort of neck, which attached it to\r\nthe rock, like the barnacles. There is a very hard ferruginous band,\r\nof which nodules may be found along the shore, full of beautifully\r\nperfect impressions of fossils, though the fossils themselves are\r\ngone. Casts of a little round bivalve shell, _Thetironia minor_, may\r\neasily be got out. The nodules also contain casts of Trigonia,\r\nPanopoea, etc. A stratum is sometimes exposed on the shore\r\ncontaining fossils converted into pyrites. A long shell, _Gervillia\r\nsublanceolata_, is the most frequent.\r\n\r\nAll the shells we have found are of sea creatures, and show us that\r\nthe Greensand was a marine formation. But the strata were formed in\r\nshallow water not far from the shore. We have learnt that coarse\r\nsediment like sand is not carried by the sea far from the coast. And a\r\ngood deal of the Greensand is coarser than sand. There are numerous\r\nbands of small pebbles. The pebbles are of various kinds; some are\r\nclear transparent quartz, bits of rock-crystal more or less rounded by\r\nrolling on the shore of the Greensand period. These go by the name of\r\nIsle of Wight diamonds, and are very pretty when polished. Another\r\nmark of the nearness of the shore when these beds were laid down is\r\nthe current bedding, of which a good example may be seen in the cliff\r\nat the north of Shanklin parade. It is sometimes called false bedding,\r\nfor the sloping bands do not mark strata laid down horizontally at the\r\nbottom of the sea, but a current has laid down layers in a sloping\r\nway,--it may be just over the edge of a sandbank. Again notice how\r\nmuch wood is to be seen in the strata. Land was evidently not far off.\r\nAll along the shore you may find hard pieces of mineralised wood, the\r\nrings of growth often showing clearly. Frequently marine worms have\r\nbored into them before they were locked up in the strata; the holes\r\nbeing generally filled afterwards with stone or pyrites.\r\n\r\nThe wood is mostly portions of trunks or branches of coniferous trees.\r\nWe also find stems of cycads. There has been found at Luccombe a very\r\nremarkable fruit of a kind of cycad. We said that in the Wealden\r\nperiod none of our flowering plants grew. But these specimens found at\r\nLuccombe show that cycads at that time were developing into flowering\r\nplants. Wonderful specimens of what may almost be called cycad flowers\r\nhave been found in strata of about this age in Wyoming in America; and\r\nthis Luccombe cycad,--called Benettites Gibsonianus,--shows what these\r\nwere like in fruit. Remains of various cycadeous plants have been\r\nfound in the corresponding strata at Atherfield; and possibly by\r\nfurther research fresh knowledge may be gained of an intensely\r\ninteresting story,--the history of the development of flowering\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the vegetation of the period was much the same as in the\r\nWealden. But these flowering cycads must have formed a marked addition\r\nto the landscape,--if indeed they did not already exist in the Wealden\r\ntimes. The cones of present day cycads are very splendidly\r\ncoloured,--orange and crimson,--and it can hardly be doubted that the\r\ncycad flowers were of brilliant hues.\r\n\r\nThe land animals were still like the Wealden reptiles. Bones of large\r\nreptiles may at times be found on the shore at Shanklin. Several have\r\nbeen picked up recently. From the prevalence of cycads we may conclude\r\nthat the climate of the Wealden and Lower Greensand was sub-tropical.\r\nThe existing Cycadaceae are plants of South Eastern Asia, and\r\nAustralia, the Cape, and Central America. The forest of trees allied\r\nto pines and firs and cedars probably occupied the higher land.\r\nTurtles and the corals point to warm waters. The existing species of\r\nTrigonia are Australian shells. This beautiful shell is found\r\nplentifully in Sydney harbour. It possesses a peculiar interest, as\r\nthe genus was supposed to be extinct, and was originally described\r\nfrom the fossil forms, and was afterwards found to be still living in\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: Carbonate of lime has been replaced by carbonate of\r\n    iron, and the latter converted into peroxide of iron.

But when we have learnt the nature of geological research, and\r\nhow to read the record of the rocks, and examined the Wealden and\r\nGreensand strata in Sandown Bay, we shall do well, if possible, to\r\nmake expeditions to Brook and Atherfield, to see the splendid\r\nsuccession of Wealden and Greensand strata shown in the cliffs of the\r\nsouth-west of the Island. It is a lonely stretch of coast, wild and\r\nstorm-swept in winter. But this part of the Island is full of\r\ninterest and charm to the lover of Nature and of the old-world\r\nvillages and the old churches and manor houses which fit so well into\r\ntheir natural surroundings. The villages in general lie back under the\r\nshelter of the downs some distance from the shore; a coastguard\r\nstation, a lonely farm house, or some fishermen's houses as at Brook,\r\nforming the only habitations of man we come to along many miles of\r\nshore. Brook Point is a spot of great interest to the geologist. Here\r\nwe come upon Wealden strata somewhat older than any in Sandown Bay.\r\nThe shore at the Point at low tide is seen to be strewn with the\r\ntrunks of fossil trees. They are of good size, some 20 ft. in length,\r\nand from one to three feet in diameter. They are known as the Pine\r\nRaft, and evidently form a mass of timber floated down an ancient\r\nriver, and stranded near the mouth, just as happens with great\r\naccumulations of timber which float down the Mississippi at the\r\npresent day. The greater part of the wood has been replaced by stone,\r\nthe bark remaining as a carbonaceous substance like coal, which,\r\nhowever, is quickly destroyed when exposed to the action of the waves.\r\nThe fossil trees are mostly covered with seaweed. On the trunks may\r\nsometimes be found black shining scales of a fossil fish, _Lepidotus\r\nMantelli_. (A stratum full of the scales of _Lepidotus_ has been\r\nrecently exposed in the Wealden of Sandown Bay.) The strata with the\r\nPine Raft form the lowest visible part of the anticline. From Brook\r\nPoint the Wealden strata dip in each direction, east and west. As the\r\ncoast does not cut nearly so straight across the strata as in Sandown\r\nBay, we see a much longer section of the beds. On either side of the\r\nPoint are coloured marls, followed by blue shales, as at Sandown. To\r\nthe westward, however, after the shales we suddenly come to variegated\r\nmarls again, followed by a second set of shales. There was long a\r\nquestion whether this repetition is due to a fault, or whether local\r\nconditions have caused a variation in the type of the beds. The\r\nconclusion of the Geological Survey Memoir, 1889, rather favoured the\r\nlatter view, on the ground of the great change which has taken place\r\nin the character of the beds in so short a distance, assuming them to\r\nbe the same strata repeated. The conjecture of the existence of a\r\nfault has, however, been confirmed; for during the last years a most\r\ninteresting section has been visible at the junction of the shales and\r\nmarls, where a fault was suspected. The shales in the cliff and on the\r\nshore are contorted into the form of a Z. The section appears to have\r\nbecome visible about 1904 (it was in the spring of that year that I\r\nfirst saw it), and was described by Mr. R. W. Hooley, F.G.S. (_Proc.\r\nGeol. Ass._, vol. xix., 1906, pp. 264, 265). It has remained visible\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nThe Wealden of Brook and the neighbouring coast is celebrated for the\r\nnumber of bones of great reptiles found here, from the early days of\r\ngeological research, the '20's and '30's of last century, when\r\nadmirable early geologists, such as Dr. Buckland and Dr. Mantell, were\r\ndiscovering the wonders of that ancient world, to the present time.\r\nVarious reptiles have been found besides the Iguanodon--the\r\nMegalosaurus, a great reptile somewhat similar, but of lighter build,\r\nwith sabre-shaped teeth, with serrated edges: the Hylaeosaurus, a\r\nsmaller creature with an armour of plates on the back, and a row of\r\nangular spines along the middle of the back; the huge _Hoplosaurus\r\nhulkei_, probably 70 or 80 feet in length; the marine Plesiosaurus and\r\nIchthyosaurus, and several more; also bones of a freshwater turtle and\r\nfour types of crocodiles. In various beds a large freshwater shell,\r\n_Unio valdensis_, occurs, and in the cliffs of Brook have been found\r\nmany cones of Cycadean plants. In bands of white sandy clay are\r\nfragments of ferns, _Lonchopteris Mantelli_. In the shales are bands\r\nof limestone with Cyrena, Paludina, and small oysters, and paper\r\nshales with cyprids, as at Sandown. The shore near Atherfield Point is\r\ncovered with fallen blocks of the limestones.\r\n\r\nThe Lower Greensand is seen in Compton Bay on the northern side of the\r\nBrook anticline. Here is a great slip of Atherfield clay. The beds\r\nabove the clay are much thinner than at Atherfield, and fossils are\r\ncomparatively scarce. On the south of the anticline the Perna bed\r\nslopes down to the sea about 150 yards east of Atherfield Point, and\r\nruns out to sea as a reef. Large blocks lie on the shore, where\r\nnumerous fossils may be found on the weathered surfaces. The ledges\r\nwhich here run out to sea form a dangerous reef, on which many vessels\r\nhave struck. There is now a bell buoy on the reef. On the headland is\r\na coastguard station, and till lately there has been a sloping wooden\r\nway from the top of the cliff to bring the lifeboat down. This was\r\nwashed away in the storms of the winter 1912-13.\r\n\r\nAbove the Perna bed lies a great thickness of Atherfield clay. Above\r\nthis lies what is called the Lower Lobster bed, a brown clay and sand,\r\nin which are numerous nodules containing the small lobster _Meyeria\r\nvectensis_,--known as Atherfield lobsters. Many beautiful specimens\r\nhave been obtained.\r\n\r\nWe next come to a great thickness of the Ferruginous Sands, some 500\r\nfeet. The Lower Greensand of Atherfield was exhaustively studied in\r\nthe earlier days of geology by Dr. Fitton, in the years 1824-47, and\r\nthe different strata are still referred to according to his divisions.\r\nThe lowest bed is the Crackers group about 60 ft. thick. In the lower\r\npart are two layers of hard calcareous boulder-shaped concretions,\r\nsome a few feet long. The lower abound in fossils, and though hard\r\nwhen falling from the cliffs are broken up by winter frosts, showing\r\nthe fossils they contain beautifully preserved in the softer sandy\r\ncores of the concretions. _Gervillia sublanceolata_ is very frequent,\r\nalso _Thetironia minor_, the Ammonite _Hoplites deshayesi_, and many\r\nmore. Beneath and between the nodular masses caverns are formed, the\r\nresounding of the waves in which has given the name of the \"Crackers.\"\r\nIn the upper part of this group is a second lobster bed.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable fossils in the Lower Greensand are the various\r\ngenera and species of the ammonites and their kindred. The Ammonite,\r\nthrough many formations, was one of the largest, and often most\r\nbeautiful shells. There were also quite small species. The number of\r\nspecies was very great. Now the whole group is extinct. They most\r\nresembled the Pearly Nautilus, which still lives. In both the shell is\r\nspiral, and consists of several chambers, the animal living in the\r\nouter chamber, the rest being air-chambers enabling it to float. The\r\nclass Cephalopoda, which includes the Ammonites, the Nautilus, and\r\nalso the Cuttle-fish, is the highest division of the Mollusca. The\r\nanimals all possess heads with eyes, and tentacles around the mouth.\r\nThey nearly all possess a shell, either external, as in the Nautilus,\r\nor internal, as in the cuttle-fishes, the internal shell of which is\r\noften washed ashore after a rough sea. The Cephalopods are divided\r\ninto two orders. The first includes the Cuttle-fish and the Argonaut\r\nor Paper Nautilus. Their tentacles are armed with suckers, and they\r\nhave highly-developed eyes. They secrete an inky fluid, which forms\r\nsepia. The internal shell of extinct species of cuttle-fish, of a\r\ncylindrical shape, with a pointed end, is a common fossil in various\r\nstrata, and is known as a Belemnite (Gr. $belemnon$ \"a dart\".) The\r\nsecond order includes the Pearly Nautilus of the present day, and the\r\nnumerous extinct Nautiloids and Ammonoids. The tentacles of the Pearly\r\nNautilus have no suckers; and the eyes are of a curiously primitive\r\nstructure,--what may be called a pin-hole camera, with no lens. The\r\nshells of the Nautilus and its allies are of simpler form, while the\r\nAmmonites are characterised by the complicated margins of the partition\r\nwalls or septa, by which the shells are sub-divided. The chambers of\r\nthe fossil Ammonites have often been filled with crystals of rich\r\ncolours; and a polished section showing the chambers is then a most\r\nbeautiful object.[4]\r\n\r\nContinuing along the shore, we come to the Lower Exogyra group, where\r\n_Terebratula sella_ is found in great abundance. A reef with _Exogyra\r\nsinuata_ runs out about 350 yards west of Whale Chine. The group is 33\r\nft. thick, and is followed by the Scaphites group, 50 ft. The beds\r\ncontain _Exogyra sinuata_, and a reef with clusters of Serpulae runs\r\nout from the cliff. In the middle of the group are bands of nodules\r\ncontaining _Macroscaphites gigas_. The Lower Crioceras bed (16 ft.)\r\nfollows, and crosses the bottom of Whale Chine. The Scaphites and\r\nCrioceras are Cephalopoda, related to the Ammonites; but in this Lower\r\nCretaceous period a remarkable development took place; many of the\r\nshells began to take curious forms, to unwind as it were. Crioceras, a\r\nvery beautiful shell, has the form of an Ammonite, but the whorls are\r\nnot in contact; thus making an open spiral like a ram's horn, whence\r\nits name (Gk. $keras$, ram, $krios$, horn). Ancyloceras begins like\r\nCrioceras, but from the last whorl continues for some length in a\r\nstraight course, then bends back again; Macroscaphites is similar, but\r\nthe whorls of the spiral part are in contact. In Scaphites, a much\r\nsmaller shell, the uncoiled part is much shorter, and its outline more\r\nrounded. It is named from its resemblance to a boat (Gk. $skaphe$).[5]\r\n\r\nThe Walpen and Ladder Clays and Sands (about 60 ft.) contain nodules\r\nwith Exogyra and the Ammonite _Douvilleiceras martini_. The\r\ndark-green clays of the lower part form an undercliff, on to which\r\nLadder Chine opens. The Upper Crioceras Group (46 ft.), like the\r\nLower, contains bands of Crioceras? also _Douvilleiceras martini_,\r\nGervillia, Trigonia, etc. It must be stated that there is some\r\nuncertainty with regard to the ammonoids found in this neighbourhood,\r\nMacroscaphites having been described as Ancyloceras, and also\r\nsometimes as Crioceras. The discovery of the true Ancyloceras\r\n(_Ancyloceras Matheronianum_) at Atherfield is described (and a figure\r\ngiven) by Dr. Mantell; but what is the characteristic ammonoid of the\r\n\"Crioceras\" beds requires further investigation. The neighbourhood of\r\nWhale and Walpen Chines is of great interest. Ammonites may be found\r\nin the bottom of Whale Chine fallen out of the rock. Red ferruginous\r\nnodules with Ammonites lie on the shore, in the Chines, and on the\r\nUndercliff, some of the ammonites more or less converted into\r\ncrystalline spar. Hard ledges of the Crioceras beds run into the sea.\r\nThe shore is usually covered deep with sand and small shingle; but there\r\nare times when the sea has washed the ledges clear; and it is then that\r\nthe shore should be examined.\r\n\r\nThe Walpen and Ladder Sands (42 ft.); the Upper Exogyra Group (16\r\nft.); the Cliff End Sand (28 ft.); and the Foliated Clay and Sand (25\r\nft.), consisting of thin alternations of greenish sand and dark-blue\r\nclay, follow. Then the Sands of Walpen Undercliff (about 100 ft.);\r\nover which lie the Ferruginous Bands of Blackgang Chine (20 ft.). Over\r\nthese hard beds the cascade of the Chine falls. Cycads and other\r\nvegetable remains are found in this neighbourhood. Throughout the\r\nAtherfield Greensand fragments of the fern _Lonchopteris_\r\n(_Weichselia_) _Mantelli_ are found. 220 ft. of dark clays and soft\r\nwhite or yellow sandrock complete the Lower Greensand. In the upper\r\nbeds of the Greensand few organic remains occur. A beautiful section\r\nof Sandrock with the junction of the Carstone is to be seen inland at\r\nRock above Bright-stone. The Sandrock here is brightly coloured like\r\nthe sands of Alum Bay,--though it belongs to a much older\r\nformation,--and shows current bedding very beautifully. The junction\r\nof the Sandrock and Carstone is also well seen in the sandpit at\r\nMarvel.\r\n\r\nWe have now come to the end of the Lower Cretaceous, in which are\r\nincluded the Wealden and the Lower Greensand. Judged by the character\r\nof the flora and fauna, the two form one period, the main difference\r\nbeing the effect of the recession of the shore line, due to the\r\nsubsidence which let in the sea over the Wealden delta, so that we\r\nhave marine strata in place of freshwater deposits. But that the\r\nplants and animals of the Wealden age still lived in the not distant\r\ncontinent is shown by the remains borne down from the land. These\r\nstrata are an example of a phenomenon often met with in geology,--that\r\nof a great thickness of deposits all laid down in shallow water. The\r\nWealden of the Isle of Wight are some 700 feet thick, in Kent a good\r\ndeal thicker, the Hastings Sands, the lower part of the formation,\r\nbeing below the horizon occurring in the Island: the Lower Greensand\r\nis some 800 feet thick. In the ancient rocks of Wales, the Cambrian\r\nand Silurian strata, are thousands of feet of deposits, mostly laid\r\ndown in fairly shallow water. In such cases there has been a\r\nlong-continued deposition of sediment, while a subsidence of the area\r\nin which it was laid down has almost exactly kept pace with the\r\ndeposit. It is difficult not to conclude that the subsidence has been\r\ncaused by the weight of the accumulating deposit,--continuing until\r\nsome world-movement of the contracting globe has produced a\r\ncompensating elevation of the area.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: Some fine ammonites may be seen at the Clarendon\r\n    Hotel, Chale,--one about 5 ft. in circumference.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: _See Guide to Fossil Invertebrata_, Brit. Mus. Nat.\r\n    Hist.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\n\r\nTHE GAULT AND UPPER GREENSAND\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the continent through which the great Wealden river\r\nflowed began to sink below the sea level, and how the waters of the\r\nsea flowed over what had been the delta of the river, laying down the\r\nbeds of sandstone with some mixture of clay which we call the Lower\r\nGreensand. The next stratum we come to is a bed of dark blue clay more\r\nor less sandy, called the Gault. In the upper beds it becomes more\r\nsandy and grey in colour. These are known as the \"passage beds,\"\r\npassing into the Upper Greensand. The thickness of the Gault clay\r\nproper varies from some 95 to 103 feet. Compared to the mainland the\r\nGault is of small thickness in the Island, though the dark clay bands\r\nin the Sandrock mark the oncoming of similar conditions. The fine\r\nsediment forming the clay points to a further sinking of the sea bed.\r\nIn general, we find very few fossils in the Gault in the Island,\r\nthough it is very fossiliferous on the mainland at Folkestone. North\r\nof Sandown Red Cliff the Gault forms a gully, down which a footpath\r\nleads to the shore. It is seen at the west of the Island in Compton\r\nBay, where in the lower part some fossil shells may be found.\r\n\r\nThe Upper Greensand is not very well named, as the beds only partially\r\nconsist of sandstone, in great part of quite other materials. Some\r\nprefer to call the Lower Greensand Vectian, from Vectis, the old name\r\nof the Isle of Wight, and the Upper Greensand Selbornian, a name\r\ngenerally adopted, because it forms a marked feature of the country\r\nabout Selborne in Hampshire.[6] But, though the Upper Greensand covers\r\na less area in the Isle of Wight than the Lower, it forms some of the\r\nmost characteristic scenery of the Island. One of the most striking\r\nfeatures of the Island is the Undercliff, the undulating wooded\r\ncountry from Bonchurch to Niton, above the sea cliff, but under a\r\nsecond cliff, a vertical wall which shelters it to the North. This\r\nwall of cliff consists of Upper Greensand. In a similar way to the\r\nsmall undercliffs we saw at Luccombe, the Undercliff has been formed\r\nby a series of great slips, caused here by the flowing out of the\r\nGault clay, which runs in a nearly horizontal band through the base of\r\nall the Southern Downs of the Island, the Upper Greensand lying above\r\nit breaking off in masses, and leaving vertical walls of cliff. These\r\nwalls are seen not only in the Undercliff, but also on the northern\r\nside of the downs, where they form the inland cliff overhanging a\r\npretty belt of woodland from Shanklin to Cook's Castle, and again\r\nforming Gat Cliff above Appuldurcombe. We have records of great\r\nlandslips at the two ends of the Undercliff, near Bonchurch and at\r\nRocken End, about a century ago. But the greater part of the\r\nUndercliff was formed by landslips in very ancient times, before\r\nrecorded history in this Island began. The outcrop of the Gault is\r\nmarked by a line of springs on all sides of the Southern Downs. The\r\nstrata above, Chalk and Upper Greensand, are porous and absorb the\r\nrainfall, which permeates through till it reaches the Gault Clay,\r\nwhich throws it out of the hill side in springs, some of which furnish\r\na water supply for the surrounding towns and villages.\r\n\r\nWhere the Upper Greensand is best developed, above the Undercliff, the\r\npassage beds are followed by 30 feet of yellow micaceous sands, with\r\nlayers of nodules of a bluish-grey siliceous limestone known as Rag.\r\nThe nodules frequently contain large Ammonites and other fossils. Next\r\nfollow the Sandstone and Rag beds, about 50 feet of sandstone with\r\nalternating layers of rag. The sandstones are grey in colour,\r\nweathering buff or reddish-brown, tinged more or less green by grains\r\nof glauconite. Near the top of these strata is the Freestone bed, a\r\nthick bed of a close-grained sandstone, weathering a yellowish grey,\r\nwhich forms a good building stone. Most of the churches and old manor\r\nand farm houses in the southern half of the Island are built of this\r\nstone. Then forming the top of the series are 24 feet of chert\r\nbeds,--bands of a hard flinty rock called chert alternating with\r\nsiliceous sandstone, the sandstone containing large concretions of rag\r\nin the same line of bedding. The chert beds are very hard, and where\r\nthe strata are horizontal, as above the Undercliff, project like a\r\ncornice at the top of the cliff. Perhaps the finest piece of the Upper\r\nGreensand is Gore Cliff above Niton lighthouse, a great vertical wall\r\nwith the cornice of dark chert strata overhanging at the top. The\r\nthickness in the Undercliff, including the Passage Beds, is from 130\r\nto 160 ft.\r\n\r\nThe Upper Greensand may be studied at Compton Bay, and at the Culvers;\r\nand along the shore west of Ventnor the lower cliff by the sea\r\nconsists largely of masses of fallen Upper Greensand, many of which\r\nshow the chert strata well. In numerous walls in the south of the\r\nIsland may be seen stone from the various strata--sandstone, blue\r\nlimestone or rag, and also the chert.\r\n\r\nLet us think what was happening when these beds were being formed. The\r\nsandstone is much finer than that of the Lower Greensand; and we have\r\nlimestones now,--marine, not freshwater as in the Wealden. Marine\r\nlimestones are formed by remains of sea creatures living at some depth\r\nin clear water. And now we come to a new material, chert. It is not\r\nunlike flint, and flint is one of the mineral forms of silica. Chert\r\nmay be called an impure or sandy flint. The bands of chert appear to\r\nhave been formed by an infiltration of silica into a sandstone,\r\nforming a dense flinty rock, which, however, has a dull appearance\r\nfrom the admixture of sand, instead of being a black semi-transparent\r\nsubstance like flint. But where did the silica come from? In the\r\ndepths of the sea many sea creatures have skeletons and shells formed\r\nof silica or flint, instead of carbonate of lime, which is the\r\nmaterial of ordinary shells and of corals. Many sponges, instead of\r\nthe horny skeleton we use in the washing sponge, have a skeleton\r\nformed of a network of needles of silica, often of beautiful forms.\r\nSome marine animalcules, the Radiolaria, have skeletons of silica. And\r\nminute plants, the Diatoms, have coverings of silica, which remain\r\nlike a little transparent box, when the tiny plant is dead. Now, much\r\nof the chert is full of needles, or spicules, as they are called, of\r\nsponges, and this points to the source from which some at least of the\r\nsilica was derived. To form the chert much of the silica has been in\r\nsome manner dissolved, and deposited again in the interstices of\r\nsandstone strata. We shall have more to say of this process when we\r\ncome to speak of the origin of the flints in the chalk. Sponges\r\nusually live in clear water of some depth; so all shows that the sea\r\nwas becoming deeper when these strata were being formed.\r\n\r\nAlong the shore of the Undercliff, Upper Greensand fossils may be\r\nfound nicely weathered out. Very common is a small curved bivalve\r\nshell,--a kind of small oyster,--_Exogyra conica_, as are also\r\nserpulae, the tubes formed by certain marine worms. Very pretty pectens\r\n(scallop shells) are found in the sandstone. Many other shells,\r\n_Terebratulae_, _Trigonia_, _Panopaea_, etc., occur, and several species\r\nof ammonite and nautilus.[7] A frequent fossil is a kind of sponge,\r\nSiphonia. It has the form of an oblong bulb, supported by a long stem,\r\nwith a root-like base. It is often silicified, and when broken shows\r\nbundles of tubular channels.\r\n\r\nIn the chert may often be seen pieces of white or bluish chalcedony,\r\ngenerally in thin plates filling cracks in the chert. This is a very\r\npure and hard form of silica, beautifully clear and translucent.\r\nPebbles which the waves have worn in the direction of the plate are\r\nvery pretty when polished, and go by the name of sand agates. They may\r\nsometimes be picked up on the shore near the Culvers.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: Names proposed by the late A. J. Jukes-Browne.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: Of Ammonites, _Mortoniceras rostratum_ and\r\n    _Hoplites splendens_ may be mentioned: and of Pectens, _Neithea\r\n    quinquecostata_ and _quadricostata_, _Syncyclonema orbicularis_,\r\n    and _AEquipecten asper_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\n\r\nTHE CHALK\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have traced the world's history written in the rocks we have\r\nseen an old continent gradually submerged, a deepening sea flowing\r\nover this part of the earth's surface. Now we shall find evidence of\r\nthe deepening of the sea to something like an ocean depth. We are\r\ncoming to the great period of the Chalk, the time when the material\r\nwas made which forms the undulating downs of the south-east of England,\r\nand of which the line of white cliffs consists, which with sundry\r\nbreaks half encircles our shores, from Flamborough Head in Yorkshire,\r\nby Dover and the Isle of Wight, to Bere in Devon. Across the Channel\r\nwhite cliffs of chalk face those of England, and the chalk stretches\r\ninland into the Continent. Its extent was formerly greater still.\r\nFragments of chalk and flint are preserved in Mull under basalt, an\r\nold lava flow, and flints from the chalk are found in more recent\r\ndeposits (Boulder Clay) on the East of Scotland, pointing to a former\r\ngreat extension northward, which has been nearly all removed by\r\ndenudation. In the Isle of Wight the chalk cliffs of Freshwater and\r\nthe Culvers are the grandest features of the Island; while all the\r\nIsland is dominated by the long lines of chalk downs running through\r\nit from east to west. Now what is the chalk? And how was it made? The\r\nmicroscope must tell us. It is found that this great mass of chalk is\r\nmade up principally of tiny microscopic shells called Foraminifera,\r\nwhole and in crushed fragments. There are plenty of foraminifera in\r\nthe seas to-day; and we need not go far to find similar shells. On the\r\nshore near Shanklin you will often see streaks of what look like tiny\r\nbits of broken shell washed into depressions in the sand. These,\r\nhowever, often consist almost entirely of complete microscopic shells,\r\nsome of them of great beauty. The creature that lives in one of these\r\nshells is only like a drop of formless jelly, and yet around itself it\r\nforms a complex shell of surprising beauty. The shells are pierced\r\nwith a number of holes, hence their name (fr. Lat. _foramen_, a hole,\r\nand _ferre_, to bear). Through these holes the animal puts out a\r\nnumber of feelers like threads of jelly, and in these entangles\r\nparticles of food, and draws them into itself. Now, do we anywhere\r\nto-day find these tiny shells in such masses as to build up rocks? We\r\ndo. The sounding apparatus, with which we measure the depths of the\r\nsea, is so constructed as to bring up a specimen of the sea bottom.\r\nThis has been used in the Atlantic, and it is found that the really\r\ndeep sea bottom, too far out for rivers and currents to bring sand and\r\nmud from the land, is covered with a white mud or ooze. And the\r\nmicroscope shows this to be made up of an unnumerable multitude of the\r\ntiny shells of foraminifera. As the little creatures die in the sea,\r\ntheir shells accumulate on the bottom, and in time will be pressed\r\ninto a hard mass like chalk, the whole being cemented together by\r\ncarbonate of lime, in the way we explained in describing the making of\r\nlimestones. So we find chalk still forming at the present day. But\r\nwhat ages it must take to form strata of solid rock of such tiny\r\nshells! And what a vast period of time it must have required to build\r\nup our chalk cliffs and downs, composed in large part of tiny\r\nmicroscopic shells! With the foraminifera the microscope shows in the\r\nchalk a multitude of crushed fragments, largely the prisms which\r\ncompose bivalve shells, flakes of shells of Terebratula and\r\nRhynchonella, and minute fragments of corals and Bryozoa. Scattered in\r\nthe chalk we shall also find larger shells and other remains of the\r\nlife of the ancient sea. The base of the cliffs and fallen blocks on\r\nthe shore are the best places to find fossils. Much of the base of the\r\ncliffs is inaccessible except by boat. The lower strata may be\r\nexamined in Sandown and Compton Bays, and the upper in Whitecliff Bay.\r\nA watch should always be kept on the tide. The quarries along the\r\ndowns are not as a rule good for collecting, as the chalk does not\r\nbecome so much sculptured by weathering.\r\n\r\nThe deep sea of the White Chalk did not come suddenly. In the oncoming\r\nof the period we find much marl--limy clay. As the sea deepened,\r\nlittle reached the bottom but the shells of foraminifera and other\r\nmarine organisms. How deep the sea became is uncertain: there is\r\nreason to believe that it did not reach a depth such as that of the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to draw the line between the Upper Greensand and the\r\nChalk strata. Above the Chert beds is a band a few feet thick known as\r\nthe Chloritic Marl, which shows a passage from sand to calcareous\r\nmatter. It is named from the abundance of grains of green colouring\r\nmatter, now recognised as glauconite; so that it would be better\r\ncalled Glauconitic Marl. It is also remarkable for the phosphatic\r\nnodules, and for the numerous casts of Ammonites, Turrilites, and\r\nother fossils mostly phosphatized, which it contains. This band is one\r\nof the richest strata in the Island for fossils. It differs, however,\r\nin different localities both in thickness and composition. It is best\r\nseen above the Undercliff, and in fallen masses along the shore from\r\nVentnor to Niton. It is finely exposed on the top of Gore Cliff, where\r\nthe flat ledges are covered with fossil Ammonites, Turrilites,\r\nPleurotomaria, and other shells. The Ammonite (_Schloenbachia\r\nvarians_) is especially common. The sponge (_Stauronema carteri_) is\r\ncharacteristic of the Glauconitic Marl. As the edge of the cliff is a\r\nvertical wall, none should try this locality but those who can be\r\ntrusted to take proper care on the top of a precipice. When a high\r\nwind is blowing the position may be especially dangerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n         [Illustration: PL. III]\r\n\r\n   (Pecten)                  Neithea Quinquecostata\r\n\r\n Thetironia     (Ammonite)            Rhynchonella\r\n Minor       Mantelliceras Mantelli   Parvirostris\r\n\r\n                (Sea Urchins)\r\n Micraster Cor-Anguinum       Echinocorys Scutatus\r\n                            (Internal cast in flint)\r\n\r\n    LOWER AND UPPER GREENSAND AND CHALK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chloritic Marl is followed by the Chalk Marl, of much greater\r\nthickness. This consists of alternations of chalk with bands of Marl,\r\nand contains glauconite and also phosphatic nodules in the lower part.\r\nUpwards it merges into the Grey Chalk, a more massive rock, coloured\r\ngrey from admixture of clayey matter. These form the Lower Chalk, the\r\nfirst of the three divisions into which the Chalk is usually divided.\r\nAbove this come the Middle and Upper, which together form the White\r\nChalk. They are much purer white than the lower division, which is\r\ncreamy or grey in colour. The Chalk Marl and Grey Chalk are well seen\r\nat the Culver Cliff, and run out in ledges on the shore. The lower\r\npart of this division is the most fossiliferous, and contains various\r\nspecies of Ammonities, Turrilites, Nautilus, and other Cephalopoda.\r\n(Of Ammonites _Schloenbachia varians_ is characteristic. Also may be\r\nnamed _S. Coupei_, _Mantelliceras mantelli_, _Metacanthoplites\r\nrotomagensis_, _Calycoceras naviculare_, the small Ammonoid Scaphites\r\naequalis; and of Pectens, _AEquipecten beaveri_ and _Syncyclonema\r\norbicularis_ may be mentioned). White meandering lines of the sponge\r\n_Plocoscyphia labrosa_ are conspicuous in the lower beds. The Chalk\r\nMarl is well shown at Gore Cliff, sloping upwards from the flat ledges\r\nof the Chloritic Marl. It may be studied well, and fossils found, in\r\nthe cliff on the Ventnor side of Bonchurch Cove,--which has all\r\nslipped down from a higher level.\r\n\r\nThe uppermost strata of the Lower Chalk are known as the Belemnite\r\nMarls. They are dark marly bands, in which a Belemnite, _Actinocamax\r\nplenus_, is found. The hard bands known as Melbourn Rock and Chalk\r\nRock, which on the mainland mark the top of the Lower and Middle Chalk\r\nrespectively, are neither of them well marked in the Isle of Wight. In\r\nthe Middle Chalk _Inoceramus labiatus_, a large bivalve shell, occurs\r\nin great profusion; and in the Upper flinty Chalk are sheets of\r\nanother species, _I. Cuvieri_. It is hardly ever found perfect, the\r\nshells being of a fibrous structure, with the fibres at right angles\r\nto the surface, and so very fragile.\r\n\r\nThere is a striking difference between the Middle and Upper Chalk,\r\nwhich all will observe. It consists in the numerous bands of dark\r\nflints which run through the Upper Chalk parallel to the strata. The\r\nLower Chalk is entirely, and the Middle Chalk nearly, devoid of flint.\r\nThough the line at which the commencement of the Upper Chalk is taken\r\nis rather below the first flint band of the Upper Chalk, and a few\r\nflints occur in the highest beds of the Middle Chalk; yet, speaking\r\ngenerally, the great distinction between the Middle and Upper Chalk,\r\nthe two divisions of the White Chalk, may be considered to be that of\r\nflintless chalk and chalk with flints.\r\n\r\nEarly in our studies we noticed the great curves into which the\r\nupheaved strata have been thrown, and that on the northern side of the\r\nanticline the strata are in places vertical. This can be well observed\r\nin the Culver Cliffs and Brading Down, where the strata of the Upper\r\nChalk are marked by the lines of black flints. In the large quarry on\r\nBrading Down the vertical lines of flint can be clearly seen; and by\r\nwalking at low tide at Whitecliff Bay round the corner of the cliff,\r\nor by observing the cliff from a boat, we may see a beautiful section\r\nof the flinty chalk, the lines of black flints sloping at a high\r\nangle. The flints in general form round or oval masses, but of\r\nirregular shape with many projections, and the masses lie in regular\r\nbands parallel to the stratification. The tremendous earth movement\r\nwhich has bent the strata into a great curve has compressed the\r\nvertical portion into about half its original thickness, and has made\r\nthe chalk of our downs extremely hard. It has also shattered the\r\nflints in the chalk into fragments. The rounded masses retain their\r\nform, but when pulled out of the chalk fall into sharp angular\r\nfragments, and we find they are shattered through and through.\r\n\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Photo by J. Milman Brown, Shanklin._]\r\n     CULVER CLIFFS--HIGHLY INCLINED CHALK STRATA\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, what are flints, and how were they formed? Flints are a form of\r\nsilica, a purer form than chert, as the chalk in which they are\r\nembedded was formed in the deep sea, and so we have no admixture of\r\nsand. Flints, as we find them in the chalk, are generally black\r\ntranslucent nodules, with a white coating, the result of a chemical\r\naction which has affected the outside after they were formed. Flint is\r\nvery hard,--harder than steel. You cannot scratch it with a knife,\r\nthough you may leave a streak of steel on the surface of the flint.\r\nThis hardness is a property of other forms of silica, as quartz and\r\nchalcedony. The question how the flints were formed is a difficult\r\none. As to this much still remains obscure. The sea contains mineral\r\nsubstances in solution. Calcium sulphate and chloride, and a small\r\namount of calcium carbonate (carbonate of lime) are in solution in the\r\nsea. From these salts is derived the calcium deposited as calcium\r\ncarbonate to form the shells of the Foraminifera and the larger\r\nshells in the Chalk. There is also silica in small quantity in sea\r\nwater. From this the skeletons of radiolaria and diatoms and the\r\nspicules of sponges are formed. Now, many flints contain fossil\r\nsponges, and when broken show a section of the sponge clearly marked.\r\nEspecially well can this be seen in flints which have lain some time\r\nin a gravel bed formed of flints worn out of the chalk by denudation.\r\nHard as a flint seems, it is penetrated by numerous fine pores. The\r\ngravel beds are usually stained yellow by water containing iron, and\r\nthis has penetrated by the pores through the substance of the flints,\r\nstaining them brown and orange. Many of the stained flints show\r\nbeautifully the sponge markings,--a wide central canal with fine\r\nthread-like canals leading into it from all sides.\r\n\r\nThe Chalk Sea evidently abounded in siliceous organisms, and it cannot\r\nbe doubted that it is from such organisms that the silica was derived,\r\nwhich has formed the masses of flint. Silica occurs in two forms--in a\r\ncrystalline form as quartz or rock crystal, and as amorphous, _i.e._,\r\nformless or uncrystalline (also called opaline) silica. The siliceous\r\nskeletons of marine organisms are formed of amorphous silica. Flint\r\nconsists of innumerable fine crystalline grains, closely packed\r\ntogether. Amorphous silica is less stable than crystalline, and is\r\ncapable of being dissolved in alkaline water, _i.e._, water containing\r\ncarbonate of sodium or potassium in solution. If the silica so\r\ndissolved be deposited again, it is generally in the crystalline form.\r\nIt seems probable, therefore, that the amorphous silica of the\r\nskeletal parts of marine organisms has been dissolved by alkaline\r\nwater percolating through the strata, and re-deposited as flint.\r\n\r\nAs the silica was deposited, chalk was removed. The large irregular\r\nmasses of flint lying in the Chalk strata have clearly taken the place\r\nof chalk which has been removed. Water charged with silica soaking\r\nthrough the strata has deposited silica, and at the same time\r\ndissolved out so much carbonate of lime. Bivalve shells, originally\r\ncarbonate of lime, are often replaced, and filled up by flint, and\r\ncasts of sea urchins in solid flint are common, and often beautiful\r\nfossils. This process of change took place after the foraminiferal\r\nooze had been compacted into chalk strata; and to some extent at any\r\nrate, there has been deposition of silica after the chalk had become\r\nhard and solid; for we find flat sheets, called tabular flint, lying\r\nalong the strata, or filling cracks cutting through the strata at\r\nright angles. But in all probability the re-arrangement of the\r\nconstituents of the strata took place in the main during the first\r\nconsolidation, as the strata rose above the sea-level, and the\r\nsea-water drained out. A suggestion has been made by R. E. Liesegang,\r\nof Dresden, to explain the occurrence of the flints in the bands with\r\nclear interspaces between, which are such a marked feature of the\r\nUpper Chalk. He has shown how \"a solution diffusing outward and\r\nencountering something with which it reacts and forms a precipitate,\r\nmoves on into this medium until a concentration sufficient to cause\r\nprecipitation of the particular salt occurs. A zone of precipitation\r\nis thus formed, through which the first solution penetrates until the\r\nconditions are repeated, and a second zone of precipitate is thrown\r\ndown. Zone after zone may thus arise as diffusion goes on.\" He\r\nsuggests that the zones of flint may be similar phenomena, water\r\ndiffusing through the masses of chalk taking up silica till such\r\nconcentration is reached that precipitation takes place, the water\r\nthen percolating further and repeating the process.[8]\r\n\r\nThe precipitation of silica and replacement of the chalk occurs\r\nirregularly along the zone of precipitation, forming great irregular\r\nmasses of flint, which enclose the sponges and other marine organisms\r\nthat lay in the chalk strata. Where a deposit of silica has begun, it\r\nwill probably have determined the precipitation of more silica, in the\r\nmanner constantly seen in chemical precipitation; and it would seem\r\nthat siliceous organisms as sponges have to some extent served as\r\ncentres around which silica has been precipitated, for flints are very\r\ncommonly found, having the evident external form of sponges.\r\n\r\nIt will be well to say something here of the history of the flints as\r\nthe chalk which contains them is gradually denuded away. Rain water\r\ncontaining carbonic dioxide has a great effect in eating away all\r\nlimestone rocks, chalk included. A vast extent of chalk, which\r\nformerly covered much of England has thus disappeared. The arch of\r\nchalk connecting our two ranges of downs has been cut through, and\r\nfrom the top of the downs themselves a great thickness of chalk has\r\nbeen removed. The chalk in the downs above Ventnor and Bonchurch is\r\nnearly horizontal. It consists of Lower and Middle Chalk; and probably\r\na small bit of the Upper occurs. But the top of St. Boniface Down is\r\ncovered with a great mass of angular flint gravel, which must have\r\ncome from the Upper Chalk. The gravel is of considerable thickness,\r\nperhaps 20 ft., and on the spurs of the down falls over to a lower\r\nlevel like a table-cloth. It is worked in many pits for road metal.\r\nThis flint gravel represents the insoluble residue which has been left\r\nwhen the Chalk was dissolved away.\r\n\r\nOn the top of the cliffs between Ventnor and Bonchurch, at a point\r\ncalled Highport, is a stratum of flint gravel carried down from the\r\ntop of the down. The shore here is strewn with large flints fallen\r\nfrom the gravel. The substance of many of the flints has undergone a\r\nremarkable change. Instead of black or dull grey flint it has become\r\ntranslucent agate, of splendid orange and purple colours, or has been\r\nchanged into clear translucent chalcedony. In the agate the forms of\r\nfossil sponges can often be beautifully seen. The colours are due to\r\niron-charged water percolating into the flint in the gravel bed, but\r\nfurther structural changes have altered the form of the silica;\r\nchalcedony having a structure of close crystalline fibres, revealed by\r\npolarized light: when variously stained and coloured, it is usually\r\ncalled agate. Many of these flints, when cut through and polished, are\r\nof great beauty. The main force of the tides along these shores is\r\nfrom west to east; and so there is a continual passage of pebbles on\r\nthe shore in that direction. The flints in Sandown Bay have in the\r\nmain travelled round from here; and towards the Culvers small handy\r\nspecimens of agates and chalcedonies rounded by the waves may be\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Photo by J. Milman Brown, Shanklin._]\r\n    SCRATCHELL'S BAY--HIGHLY INCLINED CHALK STRATA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extensive downs in the centre of the Island are largely overspread\r\nwith angular flint gravel similarly formed to that of St. Boniface. Of\r\nother beds of gravel, which have been washed down to a lower level by\r\nrivers or other agency we shall have more to say later.\r\n\r\nThe Chalk strata in the Isle of Wight are of great thickness. In the\r\nCulver Cliff there are some 400 feet of flintless Chalk (Lower and\r\nMiddle Chalk), and then some 1,000 feet of chalk with flints. There is\r\nsome variation in the thickness of the strata in different parts of\r\nthe Island, and the amount of the Upper strata, which has been\r\nremoved by denudation, varies considerably. The average thickness of\r\nthe white chalk in the Island is about 1,350 feet.[9] Including the\r\nLower Chalk, the maximum thickness of the Chalk strata is 1,630 ft.\r\n\r\nThe divisions of the chalk we have so far considered depend on the\r\ncharacter of the rock: we must say a word about another way of\r\ndividing the strata. It is found that in the chalk, as in other\r\nstrata, fossils change with every few feet of deposit. We may make a\r\nzoological division of the chalk by seeing how the fossils are\r\ndistributed. The Chalk was first studied from this point of view by\r\nthe great French geologist, M. Barrois, who divided it into zones,\r\naccording to the nature of the animal life, the zones being called by\r\nthe name of some fossil specially characteristic of a particular zone.\r\nMore recently Dr. A. W. Rowe has made a very careful study of the\r\nzones of the White Chalk, and is now our chief authority on the\r\nsubject. The strata have been grouped into zones as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n               Zones.              Sub-Zones.\r\n\r\n        { Belemnitella mucronata.\r\n        { Actinocamax quadratus.\r\n        {                        { Offaster pilula.\r\n Upper  { Offaster pilula.       { Echinocorys depressus.\r\n Chalk. {\r\n        { Marsupites             { Marsupites.\r\n        {   testudinarius.       { Uintacrinus.\r\n        { Micraster cor-anguinum.\r\n        { Micraster cor-testudinarium.\r\n        { Holaster planus.\r\n\r\n Middle { Terebratulina lata.\r\n Chalk. { Inoceramus labiatus.\r\n\r\n        { Holaster subglobosus. { Actinocamax\r\n Lower  {                       {   plenus (at top).\r\n Chalk. { Schloenbachia varians.{ Stauronema\r\n        {                       {   carteri (at base).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe method of study according to zoological zones is of great\r\ninterest. The period of the White Chalk was of long duration, and the\r\nphysical conditions remained very uniform. So that by studying the\r\nsuccession of life during this period we may learn much about the\r\ngradual change of life on the earth, and the evolution of living\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the whole mass of the chalk is made up mainly of the\r\nremains of living things,--mostly of the microscopic foraminifera. We\r\nhave seen that sponges were very plentiful in that ancient sea. Of\r\nother fossils we find brachiopods--different species of Terebratula\r\nand Rhynchonella--a large bivalve _Inoceramus_ sometimes very common;\r\nthe very beautiful bivalve, _Spondylus spinosus_, belemnites, serpulae;\r\nand different species of sea-urchin are very common. A pretty\r\nheart-shaped one, _Micraster cor-anguinum_, marks a zone of the higher\r\nchalk, which runs along the top of our northern downs. Other common\r\nsea urchins are various species of _Cidaris_, of a form like a turban\r\n(Gk. _cidaris_, a Persian head-dress); _Cyphosoma_, another circular\r\nform; the oval _Echinocorys scutatus_, which, with varieties of the\r\nsame and allied species, abounds in the Upper Chalk, and the more\r\nconical _Conulus conicus_. The topmost zone, that of _B. Macronata_,\r\nwould yield a record of exuberant life, were the chalk soft and\r\nhorizontal. There was a rich development of echinoderms (sea urchins\r\nand star fishes), but nothing is perfect, owing to the hardness of the\r\nrock (Dr. Rowe). The general difference in the life of the Chalk\r\nperiod is the great development of Ammonites and other Cephalopods in\r\nthe Lower Chalk, and of sea urchins and other echinoderms in the\r\nUpper, while the Middle Chalk is wanting in the one and the other.\r\nShark's teeth tell of the larger inhabitants of the ocean that flowed\r\nabove the chalky bottom.\r\n\r\nMany quarries have been opened on the flanks of the Chalk Downs, of\r\nwhich a large number are now disused. They occur just where they are\r\nneeded for chalk to lay on the land, the pure chalk on the north of\r\nthe Downs to break up the heavy Tertiary clays, which largely cover\r\nthe north of the Island; the more clayey beds of the Grey Chalk on the\r\nsouth of the downs to stiffen the light loams of the Greensand.[10]\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: See _Common Stones_, by Grenville A. J. Cole,\r\n    F.R.S. 1921.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: 1,472 ft. at the western end of the Island, 1,213\r\n    ft. at the eastern.--Dr. Rowe's measurements.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: Dr. A. W. Rowe.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII\r\n\r\nTHE TERTIARY ERA: THE EOCENE\r\n\r\n\r\nAges must have passed while the ocean flowed over this part of the\r\nworld, and the chalk mud, with its varied remains of living things,\r\ngradually accumulated at the bottom. At last a change came. Slowly the\r\nsea bed rose, till the chalk, now hardened by pressure, was raised\r\ninto land above the sea level. As soon as this happened, sea waves and\r\nrain and rivers began to cut it down. There is evidence here of a wide\r\ngap in the succession of the strata. Higher chalk strata, which\r\nprobably once existed, have been washed away, while the underlying\r\nstrata have been planed off to an even surface more or less oblique to\r\nthe bedding-planes. The highest zone of the chalk in the Island (that\r\nof _Belemnitella macronata_) varies greatly in thickness, from 150 ft.\r\nat the eastern end of the Island to 475 at the western. The latest\r\ninvestigations give reason to conclude that this is due to gentle\r\nsynclines and anticlines, which have been planed smooth by the erosion\r\nwhich preceded the deposition of the next strata,--the Eocene.[11] At\r\nAlum Bay the eroded surface of the chalk may be seen with rolled\r\nflints lying upon it, and rounded hollows or pot-holes, the appearance\r\nbeing that of a foreshore worn in a horizontal ledge of rock, much\r\nlike the Horse Ledge at Shanklin.\r\n\r\nThe land sank again, but not to anything like the depth of the great\r\nChalk Sea. We now come to an era called the Tertiary. The whole\r\ngeological history is divided into four great eras. The first is the\r\nEozoic, or the age of the Archaean,--often called Pre-Cambrian--rocks;\r\nrocks largely volcanic, or greatly altered since their formation,\r\nshowing only obscure traces of the life which no doubt existed. Then\r\nfollow the Primary era, or, as it is generally called, the Palaeozoic;\r\nthe Secondary or Mesozoic; and the Tertiary or Kainozoic. Palaeozoic is\r\nused rather than Primary, as this word is ambiguous, being also used\r\nfor the crystalline rocks first formed by the solidification of the\r\nmolten surface of the earth. But Secondary and Tertiary are still in\r\nconstant use. These long ages, or eras, were of very unequal duration;\r\nyet they mark such changes in the life of animal and plant upon the\r\nearth that they form natural divisions. The Palaeozoic was an immense\r\nperiod during which life abounded in the seas,--numberless species of\r\nmollusca, crustaceans, corals, fish are found,--and there were great\r\nforests, which have formed the coal measures, on land,--forests of\r\nstrange primeval vegetation, but in which beautiful ferns, large and\r\nsmall, flourished in great numbers. The Secondary Era may be called\r\nthe age of reptiles. To this era all the rocks we have so far studied\r\nbelong. Now we come to the last era, the Tertiary, the age of the\r\nmammals. Instead of reptiles on land, in sea and air, we find a\r\ncomplete change. The earth is occupied by the mammalia; the air\r\nbelongs to the birds such as we see to-day. The strange birds of the\r\nOolitic and Cretaceous have passed away. Birds have taken their modern\r\nform. In some parts of the world strata are found transitional between\r\nthe Secondary and Tertiary.\r\n\r\nThe Tertiary is divided into four divisions,--the Eocene, the\r\nOligocene (once called Upper Eocene), the Miocene, and the Pliocene;\r\nwhich words signify,--Pliocene the more recent period, Miocene the\r\nless recent, Eocene the dawn of the recent.\r\n\r\nIn the Eocene we shall find marine deposits of a comparatively shallow\r\nsea, and beds deposited at the mouth of great rivers, where remains of\r\nsea creatures are mingled with those washed down from the land by the\r\nrivers. These strata run through the Isle of Wight from east to west,\r\nand we may study them at either end of the Island, in Whitecliff and\r\nAlum Bays. The strata are highly inclined, so that we can walk across\r\nthem in a short walk. Some beds contain many fossils, but many of the\r\nshells are very brittle and crumbly; and we can only secure good\r\nspecimens by cutting out a piece of the clay or sand containing them,\r\nand transferring them carefully to boxes, to be carried home with\r\nequal care. Often much of the face of the cliff is covered with slip\r\nor rainwash, and overgrown with vegetation. Sometimes a large slip\r\nexposes a good hunting ground.\r\n\r\nNow let us walk along the shore, and try to read the story these\r\nTertiary beds tell us. We will begin in Whitecliff Bay. Though easily\r\naccessible, it remains still in its natural beauty. The sea washes in\r\non a fine stretch of smooth sand sheltered by the white chalk wall\r\nwhich forms the south arm of the bay. North of the Culver downs the\r\ncliffs are much lower, and consist of sands and clays of varying\r\ncolour, following each other in vertical bands. Looking along the line\r\nof shore we notice a band of limestone, at first nearly vertical like\r\nthe preceding strata, then curving at a sharp angle as it slopes to\r\nthe shore, and running out to sea in a reef known as Bembridge Ledge.\r\nThis is the Bembridge limestone; and the beginning of the reef marks\r\nthe northern boundary of Whitecliff Bay, the shore, however,\r\ncontinuing in nearly the same line to Bembridge Foreland, and showing\r\na continuous succession of Eocene and Oligocene strata. The strata\r\nnorth of the limestone are nearly horizontal, dipping slightly to the\r\nnorth. In the Bembridge limestone we see the end of the Sandown\r\nanticline, and the beginning of the succeeding syncline. The strata\r\nnow dip under the Solent, and rise into another anticline in the\r\nPortsdown Hills. North and south of the great anticline of the Weald\r\nof Kent and Sussex are two synclinal troughs known as the London and\r\nHampshire basins. Nearly the whole of our English Eocene strata lies\r\nin these two basins, having been denuded away from the anticlinal\r\narches. The Oligocene only occur in the Hampshire basin, the higher\r\nstrata only in the Isle of Wight.\r\n\r\n\r\n [Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n COAST SECTION, WHITECLIFF BAY.\r\n\r\n BM  _Bembridge Marls._\r\n BL  _Bembridge Limestone._\r\n O   _Osborne Beds._\r\n H   _Headon Beds._\r\n BS  _Barton Sand._\r\n B   _Barton Clay._\r\n Br  _Bracklesham Beds._\r\n Bg  _Bagshot Beds._\r\n L   _London Clay._\r\n R   _Reading Beds._\r\n Ch  _Chalk._\r\n P   _Pebble Beds._\r\n S   _Sandstone Band._\r\n\r\n\r\nAbove the Chalk we come first to a thick red clay called Plastic clay.\r\nIt is much slipped, and the slip is overgrown. The only fossils found\r\nin the Island are fragments of plants; larger plant remains on the\r\nmainland show a temperate climate. This clay was formerly worked at\r\nNewport for pottery. The clay is probably a freshwater deposit formed\r\nin fairly deep water. On the mainland we find on the border shallow\r\nwater deposits called the Woolwich and Reading beds. (The clay is 150\r\nto 160 ft. thick at Whitecliff Bay, less than 90 ft. at the Alum Bay.)\r\nWe come next to a considerable thickness of dark clay with sand, at\r\nthe surface turned brown by weathering. This is the London clay, so\r\ncalled because it underlies the area on which London is built. At the\r\nbase is a band of rounded flint pebbles, which extends at the base of\r\nthe clay from here to Suffolk. In it, as well as in a hard sandstone\r\n18 inches higher up, are tubular shells of a marine worm, _Ditrupa\r\nplana_. The sandstone runs out on the shore. About 35 ft. above the\r\nbasement bed is a zone of _Panopaea intermedia_ and _Pholadomya\r\nmargaritacea_, at 50 ft. another band of _Ditrupa_, and at about 80\r\nft. a band with a small _Cardita_. In the higher part of the clay are\r\nlarge septaria,--rounded blocks of a calcareous clay-ironstone, with\r\ncracks running through them filled with spar. _Pinna affinis_ is found\r\nin the septaria. The thickness of the clay in Whitecliff Bay is 322\r\nfeet. It can be seen on the shore, when the tide happens to have swept\r\nthe sand away. Otherwise the lower beds are hardly visible, there\r\nbeing no cliff here, but a slope overgrown with vegetation.\r\n\r\nIn Alum Bay the London clay, about 400 ft. in thickness, consists of\r\nclays, chiefly dark blue, with sands, and lines of septaria. In the\r\nlower part is a dark clay with _Pholadomya margaritacea_, still\r\npreserving the pearly nacre. There are also _Panopaea intermedia_, and\r\nin septaria _Pinna affinis_. All these with their pearly lustre, are\r\nbeautiful fossils. A little higher is a zone with _Ditrupa_, and\r\nfurther on a band of _Cardita_. Other shells also are found in the\r\nclay, especially in the lower part. They are all marine, and indicate\r\na sub-tropical climate. Lines of pebbles show that we are near a\r\nbeach. In other parts of the south of England remains from the land\r\nare found, borne down an ancient river in the way we found before in\r\nthe Wealden deposits.\r\n\r\nBut times have changed since the Wealden days, and the life of the\r\nTertiary times has a much more modern appearance. From leaves and\r\nfruits borne down from the forest we can learn clearly the nature of\r\nthe early Eocene land and climate. Leaves are found at Newhaven, and\r\nnumerous fossil fruits at Sheppey. The character of the vegetation\r\nmost resembled that now to be seen in India, South Eastern Asia, and\r\nAustralia. Palms grew luxuriantly, the most abundant fruit being that\r\nof one called Nipadites, from its resemblance to the Nipa palm, which\r\ngrows on the banks of rivers in India and the Philippines. The forests\r\nalso included plants allied to cypresses, banksia, maples, poplars,\r\nmimosa, custard apples, gourds, and melons. The rivers abounded in\r\nturtle--large numbers of remains of which are found in the London clay\r\nat the mouth of the Thames--crocodiles and alligators. With the\r\nexception of the south east of England, all the British Isles formed\r\npart of a continental mass of land covered with a tropical vegetation.\r\nThe mountain chains of England, Scotland, and Wales rose as now, but\r\nhigher. Long denudation has worn them down since. In the south-east of\r\nEngland the coast line fluctuated; and sea shells, and the remains of\r\nthe plant and animal life of the neighbourhood of a great tropical\r\nriver alternate in the deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\n [Illustration: FIG. 4]\r\n\r\n SECTION THROUGH HEADON HILL AND HIGH DOWN.\r\n SHOWING STRATA SEEN AT ALUM BAY.\r\n\r\n G    _Gravel Cap._\r\n Bm   _Bembridge Limestone._\r\n O    _Osborne Beds._\r\n UH   _Upper Headon._\r\n MH   _Middle  \"   ._\r\n LH   _Lower Headon._\r\n BS   _Barton Sand._\r\n B    _Barton Clay._\r\n Br   _Bracklesham Beds._\r\n Bg   _Bagshot Sands._\r\n L    _London Clay._\r\n R    _Reading Beds._\r\n Ch   _Chalk._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe London clay is succeeded by a great thickness of sands and clays\r\nwhich form the Bagshot series. These are divided in the London basin\r\ninto Lower, Middle, and Upper Bagshot. In the Hampshire basin the\r\nstrata are now classified as Bagshot Sands, Bracklesham Beds, Barton\r\nBeds, the last comprising the Barton Clay and the Barton Sand,\r\nformerly termed Headon Hill Sands. There is some uncertainty as to the\r\nmanner in which these correspond to the beds of the Bagshot district,\r\nas the Tertiary strata have been divided by denudation into two\r\ngroups, and differ in character in the two areas. It is possible that\r\nthe Barton Sand represents a later deposit than any in the London\r\narea.\r\n\r\nAlmost the only fossil remains in the Bagshot Sands are those of\r\nplants, but these are of great interest. In Whitecliff Bay the beds\r\nconsist for the most part of yellow sands, above which is a band of\r\nflint pebbles, which has been taken as the base of the Bracklesham\r\nseries, for in the clay immediately above marine shells occur. The\r\nBagshot Sands, in Whitecliff Bay, are about 138 feet thick, in Alum\r\nBay, 76 feet, according to the latest classification. In Alum Bay the\r\nstrata consist of sands, yellow, grey, white, and crimson, with clays,\r\nand bands of pipe clay. This is remarkably white and pure, as though\r\nderived from white felspar, like the China clay in Cornwall. The pipe\r\nclay contains leaves of trees, sometimes beautifully preserved.\r\nSpecimens are not very easy to obtain, as only the edges of the leaves\r\nappear at the surface of the cliff. They have been found chiefly in a\r\npocket, or thickening of the seam of pipe clay, which for forty years\r\nyielded specimens abundantly, afterwards thinning out, when the leaves\r\nbecame rare. The leaves lie flat, as they drifted and settled down in\r\na pool. With them are the twigs of a conifer, occasionally a fruit or\r\nflower, or the wing case of a beetle. The leaves show a tropical\r\nclimate. The flora is a local one, differing considerably from those\r\nof Eocene deposits elsewhere. The plants are nearly all dicotyledons.\r\nOf palms there are only a few fragments, while the London clay of\r\nSheppey is rich in palm fruits, and many large palms are found in the\r\nBournemouth leaf beds, corresponding in date to the Bracklesham. The\r\ndifferences may be largely due to conditions of locality and\r\ndeposition. The Alum Bay flora is characterised by a wealth of\r\nleguminous plants, and large leaves of species of fig (_Ficus_);\r\nsimple laurel and willow-like leaves are common, of which it is\r\ndifficult to determine the species, and there is abundance of a\r\nspecies of _Aralia_. The character of the flora resembles most those\r\nof Central America and the Malay Archipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: PL. IV]\r\n\r\n          Nummulites Laevigatus\r\n\r\n Turritella                  Limnaea\r\n Imbricataria                Longiscata\r\n\r\n           Cardita Planicosta\r\n\r\n (Fusus)                     Planorbis\r\n Leiostama Pyrus             Euomphalus\r\n\r\n           Cyrena Semistriata\r\n\r\n          EOCENE AND OLIGOCENE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bracklesham Beds in Alum Bay (570 ft. thick) consist of clays,\r\nwith lignite forming bands 6 in. to 2 ft. thick; white, yellow, and\r\ncrimson sands; and in the upper part dark sandy clays, with bands\r\nshowing impressions of marine fossils. Alum Bay takes its name from\r\nthe alum formerly manufactured from the Tertiary clays. The coloured\r\nsands have made the bay famous. The colours of the sands when freshly\r\nexposed, and of the cliffs when wet with rain, are very rich and\r\nbeautiful,--deep purple, crimson, yellow, white, and grey. Some of the\r\nbeds are finely striped in different shades by current bedding. The\r\ncontrast of these coloured cliffs with the White Chalk, weathered to a\r\nsoft grey, of the other half of the bay is very striking and\r\nbeautiful. About 45 ft. from the top is a conglomerate of flint\r\npebbles, some of large size, cemented by iron oxide. In Whitecliff Bay\r\nthe Bracklesham Beds (585 ft.) consist of clays, sands, and sandy\r\nclays, mostly dark, greenish and blue in colour, containing marine\r\nfossils and lignite. Sir Richard Worsley, in his History of the Isle\r\nof Wight, tells that in February, 1773, a bed of coal was laid bare in\r\nWhitecliff Bay, causing great excitement in the neighbourhood. People\r\nflocked to the shore for coal, but it proved worthless as fuel. It\r\nhas, however, been worked to some extent in later years. In some of\r\nthe beds are many fossils. Numbers have lately been visible where a\r\nlarge founder has taken place. There are large shells of _Cardita\r\nplanicosta_ and _Turritella imbricataria_. They are, however, very\r\nfragile. In a stratum just above these are numbers of a large\r\nNummulite (_Nummulites laevigatus_). These are round flat shells like\r\ncoins,--hence the name (Lat. _nummus_, a coin). They are a large\r\nspecies of foraminifera. We may split them with a penknife; and then\r\nwe see a pretty spiral of tiny chambers. A smaller variety, _N.\r\nvariolarius_, occurs a little further on, and a tiny kind, _N.\r\nelegans_, in the Barton clay. One of the most striking features of the\r\nlater Eocene is the immense development of Nummulite limestones--vast\r\nbeds built up of the delicate chambered shells of Nummulites,--which\r\nextend from the Alps and Carpathians into Thibet, and from Morocco,\r\nAlgeria, and Egypt, through Afghanistan and the Himalaya to China. The\r\npyramids of Egypt are built of this limestone.\r\n\r\nThe Bracklesham beds are followed by the Barton clay, famous for the\r\nnumber of beautiful fossil shells found at Barton on the Hampshire\r\ncoast. At Whitecliff Bay the fossils are, unfortunately, very friable.\r\nAt Alum Bay the pathway to the shore is in a gully in the upper part\r\nof the Barton clay. The strata consist of clays, sands, and sandy\r\nclays. The base of the beds is marked by the zone of _Nummulites\r\nelegans_. Numerous very pretty shells of the smaller Barton types may\r\nbe found, with fragments of larger ones; or a whole one may be found.\r\nOwing to the cliff section cutting straight across the strata, which\r\nare nearly vertical, there is far less of the beds open to observation\r\nthan at Barton, which probably accounts for the list of fossils being\r\nmuch smaller. The shells are chiefly several species of _Pleurotoma_,\r\n_Rostellaria_, _Fusus_, _Voluta_, _Turritella_, _Natica_, a small\r\nbivalve _Corbula pisum_, a tubular shell of a sand-boring mollusc\r\n_Dentalium_, _Ostroea_, _Pecten_, _Cardium_, _Crassatella_. The\r\nfauna is like a blending of Malayan and New Zealand forms of marine\r\nlife. Throughout the Eocene from the London clay onward the shells are\r\nsuch as abound in the warm sea south east of Asia. Similarly the plant\r\nremains take us into a tropic land, where fan palms and feather palms\r\novershadowed the country, trees of the tropics mingling with trees we\r\nstill find in more Northern latitudes. The general character of the\r\nflora as of the shells was Oriental and Malayan; both being succeeded\r\nin later strata by a flora and fauna with greater analogy to that now\r\nexisting in Western North America.\r\n\r\nIn Alum Bay the Barton clay is suddenly succeeded by the very fine\r\nyellow and white sands which run along the western base of Headon\r\nHill, the curve of the syncline bringing them round from a nearly\r\nvertical to an almost horizontal position. These are now known as the\r\nBarton Sand. They are 90 ft. thick, the whole of the Barton beds being\r\n338 ft. in Alum Bay, 368 ft. in Whitecliff. The sands were formerly\r\nextensively used for glass making. They are almost unfossiliferous.\r\nThe passage from Barton clay to the sands in Whitecliff Bay is more\r\ngradual. The sands here show some fine colouring which reminds us of\r\nthe more celebrated sands of Alum Bay.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 11: See Memoir of Geological Survey of I. W. by H. J.\r\n    Osborne White, F.G.S. 1921, p. 90.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX\r\n\r\nTHE OLIGOCENE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe pass on to strata which used to be called Upper Eocene, but are now\r\ngenerally classified as a period by themselves, and called the\r\nOligocene. They are also known as the Fluvio-marine series. Large part\r\nwas deposited in freshwater by rivers running into lagoons, or in the\r\nbrackish water of estuaries, while at times the sea encroached, and\r\nbeds of marine origin were laid down.\r\n\r\nThe west of the Island is much the best locality for the lower strata,\r\nthose which take their name from Headon Hill between Alum and Totland\r\nBays. There are three divisions of the Headon strata, marine beds in\r\nthe middle coming between upper and lower beds formed in fresh and\r\nbrackish water. Light green clays are very characteristic of these\r\nbeds, and at the west of the Island thick freshwater limestones, which\r\nhave died out before the strata re-appear in Whitecliff Bay. The\r\nstrongest masses of limestone in Headon Hill belong to the Upper\r\ndivision. The limestones are full of freshwater shells, nearly all the\r\nlong spiral Limnaea and the flat spiral disc of Planorbis, perhaps the\r\nmost abundant species being _L. longiscata_ and _P. euomphalus_. The\r\nlimestones themselves are almost entirely the produce of a freshwater\r\nplant _Chara_, which precipitates lime on its tissues, in the same\r\nmanner as the sea weeds we call corallines. On the shore round the\r\nbase of Headon Hill lie numerous blocks of limestone, the debris of\r\nstrata fallen in confusion, in which are beautiful specimens of Limnaea\r\nand Planorbis. The shells, however, are very fragile. The marine beds\r\nof the Middle Headon are best seen in Colwell Bay, where a few yards\r\nnorth of How Ledge they descend to the beach, and a cliff is seen\r\nformed of a thick bed of oysters, _Ostrea velata_. The oysters occupy\r\na hollow eroded in a sandy clay full of _Cytherea incrassata_, from\r\nwhich the bed is known as the \"Venus\" bed, the shell formerly being\r\ncalled _Venus_, later _Cytherea_, at present _Meretrix_. The marine\r\nbeds contain many drifted freshwater shells as Limnaea and Cyrena. The\r\nHow Ledge limestone forms the top of the Lower Headon. It is full of\r\nwell-preserved Limnaea and Planorbis.\r\n\r\nThe Upper and Lower Headon are mainly fresh or brackish water\r\ndeposits. The purely freshwater beds contain _Limnaea_, _Planorbis_,\r\n_Paludina_, _Unio_, and land-shells. In the brackish are found\r\n_Potamomya_, _Cyrena_, _Cerithium_ (_Potamides_), _Melania_ and\r\n_Melanopsis_. _Paludina lenta_ is very abundant throughout the\r\nOligocene. A large number of the marine shells of the Headon beds are\r\nspecies also found in the Barton clay. _Cytherea_, _Voluta_,\r\n_Ancillaria_, _Pleurotoma_, _Natica_ are purely marine genera.\r\n\r\nIn White Cliff Bay the beds are mostly estuarine. Most of the fossils\r\nare found in two bands, one about 30 ft. above the base of the series,\r\nthe other a stiff blue clay, about 90 feet higher, which seems to\r\ncorrespond with the \"Venus Bed\" of Colwell Bay. Many of the fossils\r\nare of Barton types.\r\n\r\nThe Headon beds are about 150 feet thick at Headon Hill, 212 ft. in\r\nWhitecliff Bay; and are followed by beds varying from about 80 to 110\r\nft. in thickness, known as the Osborne and St. Helens series. They\r\nconsist mainly of marls variously coloured, with sandstone and\r\nlimestone. In Headon Hill is a thick concretionary limestone, which\r\nalmost disappears northward. The Oligocene strata often vary\r\nconsiderably within short distances. The Osborne beds are exposed\r\nalong the low shore between Cowes and Ryde, and from Sea View to St.\r\nHelens. In Whitecliff Bay they are not well seen, occurring in\r\novergrown slopes. They consist mostly of red and green clays. A band\r\nof cream-yellow limestone a foot thick is the most conspicuous\r\nfeature. The fossils resemble those from the Headon beds, but are much\r\nless plentiful. The marls seem to have been mostly deposited in\r\nlagoons of brackish water, which at the present day are favourite\r\nplaces for turtles and alligators, and of these many remains are found\r\nin the Osborne beds. The beds are specially noted for the shoals of\r\nsmall fish, _Diplomystus vectensis_ (_Clupea_), first observed by Mr.\r\nG. W. Colenutt, F.G.S., and prawns found in them, and also remains of\r\nplants. The beds that appear in the neighbourhood of Sea View and St.\r\nHelens are divided into Nettlestone Grits and St. Helen's Sands, the\r\nformer containing a freestone 8 feet thick.\r\n\r\nAbove these beds lies the Bembridge limestone, which is so\r\nconspicuous in Whitecliff Bay, and forms Bembridge Ledge. On the north\r\nshore of the Island the strata rise slightly on the northern side of\r\nthe syncline. There are also minor undulations in an east and west\r\ndirection. The result is to bring up the Bembridge limestone at\r\nvarious points along the north shore, where it forms conspicuous\r\nledges--Hamstead Ledge at the mouth of the Newtown river, ledges in\r\nThorness Bay, and Gurnard Ledge. In Whitecliff Bay the limestone,\r\nabout 25 feet thick, forms the conspicuous reef called Bembridge\r\nLedge. The Bembridge limestone consists of two or more bands of\r\nlimestone with intercalated clays. It is usually whiter than the\r\nHeadon limestones, and the fossils occur as casts, the shells being\r\nsometimes replaced by calc-spar. The limestone has been much used as a\r\nbuilding stone for centuries, not only in the Island, but for\r\nbuildings on the mainland. The most famous quarries were those near\r\nBinstead, from which Quarr, the site of the great Abbey, now almost\r\nentirely disappeared, derives its name. From these quarries was\r\nobtained much of the stone for Winchester Cathedral and many other\r\nancient buildings. In the old walls and buildings of Southampton the\r\nstone may be recognised at once by the casts of the Limnaeae it\r\ncontains. The quarries at Quarr were noted in more ways than one. In\r\nlater times the remains of early mammalia,--Palaeotherium,\r\nAnoplotherium, and others--have been found. The quarries are now\r\nabandoned and overgrown. The limestone may be seen inland at Brading,\r\nwhere it forms the ridge on which the Church stands.\r\n\r\nThe limestone is a freshwater formation, and the fossils are mostly\r\nfreshwater shells, of the same type as the Headon, Limnaea and\r\nPlanorbis the most common. There are also land shells, especially\r\nseveral species of Helix, the genus which includes the common\r\nsnail,--_H. globosa_, very large,--and great species of _Bulimus_\r\n(_Amphidromus_) and _Achatina_ (_B. Ellipticus_, _A. costellata_).\r\nThese interesting shells were chiefly obtained in the limestone at\r\nSconce near Yarmouth, a locality now inaccessible, being occupied by\r\nfortifications. The land shells have an affinity to species now found\r\nin Southern North America. The limestone also abounds in the so-called\r\n\"seeds\" of Chara. The reproductive organs,--the \"seeds,\"--of this\r\ncurious water-plant, allied to the lower Algae, are, like the rest of\r\nthe plant, encased in carbonate of lime, and are very durable. Large\r\nnumbers are found in the Oligocene strata. Under the microscope they\r\nare seen to be beautifully sculptured in various designs, with a\r\ndelicate spiral running round them. Above the limestone lie the\r\nBembridge marls, varying in thickness in different localities from 70\r\nto 120 feet. North of Whitecliff Bay they stretch on to the Foreland.\r\nThey are in the main a freshwater formation, but a few feet above the\r\nlimestone is a marine band with oysters, _Ostrea Vectensis_. It runs\r\nout along the shore, where the oysters may be seen covering the\r\nsurface. The Lower Marls consist chiefly of variously-coloured clays\r\nwith many shells, chiefly _Cyrena pulchra_, _semistriata_, and\r\n_obovata_, _Cerithium mutabile_, and _Melania muricata_ (_acuta_); and\r\nred and green marls, in which are few shells, but fragments of turtle\r\noccur. A little above the oyster bed is a band of hard-bluish\r\nseptarian limestone. Sixty years ago Edward Forbes remarked on the\r\nresemblance of this band to the harder insect-bearing limestones of\r\nthe Purbeck beds. In a limestone exactly resembling this, and\r\nsimilarly situated in the lower part of the marls in Gurnard and\r\nThorness Bays, numerous insects were afterwards found,--beetles,\r\nflies, locusts, and dragonflies, and spiders. Leaves of plants,\r\nincluding palms, fig, and cinnamon, have also been found in this bed,\r\nshowing that the climate was still sub-tropical. The upper Marls\r\nconsist chiefly of grey clays with abundance of _Melania turritissima_\r\n(_Potamaclis_). The chief shells in the marls are _Cyrena_, _Melania_,\r\n_Melanopsis_ and _Paludina_ (_Viviparus_). They are often beautifully\r\npreserved; the species of Cyrena often retain their colour-markings.\r\n\r\nBembridge Foreland is formed by a thick bed of flint gravel resting on\r\nthe marls, which are seen again in Priory Bay, where in winter they\r\nflow over the sea-wall in a semi-liquid condition. They lie above the\r\nlimestone at Gurnard, Thorness, and Hamstead. West of Hamstead Ledge\r\nthe whole of the beds crop out on the shore, where beautifully\r\npreserved fossils may be collected. Large pieces of drift wood occur,\r\nalso seeds and fruit. Many fragments of turtle plates may be found.\r\nLarge crystals of selenite (sulphate of lime) occur in the Marls.\r\n\r\nLast of the Oligocene in the Isle of Wight are the Hamstead beds.\r\nThese strata are peculiar to the Isle of Wight. The Bembridge beds\r\nalso are not found on the mainland, except a small outlier at\r\nCreechbarrow Hill in Dorset. The Hamstead beds consist of some 250\r\nfeet of marls, in which many interesting fossils have been found. They\r\ncover a large area of the northern part of the Island, largely\r\noverlaid by gravels, and are only seen on the coast at Hamstead, where\r\nthey form the greater part of the cliff, which reaches a height of 210\r\nft., the top being capped by gravel. In winter the clays become\r\nsemi-liquid, in summer the surface may be largely slip and rainwash,\r\nbaked hard by the sun. The lower part of the strata may be best seen\r\non the shore. The strata consist of 225 ft. of freshwater, estuarine,\r\nand lagoon beds, with _Unio_, _Cyrena_, _Cyclas_, _Paludina_,\r\n_Hydrobia_, _Melania_, _Planorbis_, _Cerithium_ (rare), and remains of\r\nturtles, crocodiles, and mammals, leaves and seeds of plants; and\r\nabove these beds 31 feet of marine beds with _Corbula_, _Cytherea_,\r\n_Ostrea callifera_, _Cuma_, _Voluta_, _Natica_, _Cerithium_, and\r\n_Melania_.\r\n\r\nExcept for the convenience of dividing so large a mass of strata, it\r\nwould not be necessary to divide these from the Bembridge beds, as no\r\nbreak in the character of the life of the period occurs at the\r\njunction. The basement bed of the Hamstead strata is known as the\r\nBlack Band, 2 feet of clay, coloured black with vegetable matter, with\r\n_Paludina lenta_ very numerous, _Melanopsis carinata_, _Limnaea_,\r\n_Planorbis_, a small _Cyclas_ (_C. Bristovii_), seed vessels, and\r\nlumps of lignite. It rests on dark green marls with _Paludina lenta_\r\nand _Melanopsis_, and full of roots. This evidently marks an old land\r\nsurface. About 65 feet higher is the White Band,--a white and green\r\nclay full of shells, mostly broken. There are bands of tabular\r\nironstone containing _Paludina lenta_. Clay ironstone was formerly\r\ncollected on the shore between Yarmouth and Hamstead and sent to\r\nSwansea to be smelted. The strata consist largely of mottled green and\r\nred clays, probably deposited in brackish lagoons. These yield few\r\nfossils except remains of turtle and crocodile and drifted plants. The\r\nblue clays are much more fossiliferous. Among other plants are leaves\r\nof palm and water-lily. The strata gradually become more marine\r\nupwards. The marine beds were called by Forbes the Corbula beds, from\r\ntwo small shells, _C. pisum_ and _C. vectensis_, of which some of the\r\nclays are full. Remains of early mammalia are found in the Hamstead\r\nbeds, the most frequent being a hog-like animal, of supposed aquatic\r\nhabits, Hyopotamus, of which there are more than one species.\r\n\r\nThe fauna and flora of the Oligocene strata show that the climate was\r\nstill sub-tropical, though somewhat cooling down from the Eocene.\r\nPalms grew in what is now the Isle of Wight. Alligators and crocodiles\r\nswam in the rivers. Turtle were abundant in river and lagoon.\r\nSpecially interesting in the Eocene and Oligocene are the mammalian\r\nremains. They show us mammals in an early stage before they branched\r\noff into the various families as we know them to-day. The Palaeotherium\r\nwas an animal like the tapir, now an inhabitant of the warmer regions\r\nof Asia and America. Recent discoveries in Eocene strata in Egypt show\r\nstages of development between a tapir-like animal and the elephant\r\nwith long trunk and tusks. There were in those days hog-like animals\r\nintermediate between the hogs and the hippopotami. There were\r\nancestors of the horse with three toes on each foot. There were\r\nhornless ancestors of the deer and antelopes. Many of the early\r\nmammals showed characters now found in the marsupials, the order to\r\nwhich the Kangaroo and Opossum belong, members of which are found in\r\nrocks of the Secondary Era, and are the only representatives of the\r\nmammalia in that age. Some of the early Eocene mammalia are either\r\nmarsupials, or closely related to them. In the Oligocene we find the\r\nmammalian life becoming more varied, and branching out into the\r\nvarious groups we know to-day; while the succeeding Miocene Period\r\nwitnesses the culmination of the mammalia--mammals of every family\r\nabounding all over the earth's surface, in a profusion and variety not\r\nseen before--or since, outside the tropics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X\r\n\r\nBEFORE AND AFTER.--THE ICE AGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have read the story written in the rocks of the Isle of Wight. What\r\nwonderful changes we have seen in the course of the long history!\r\nFirst we were taken back to the ancient Wealden river, and saw in\r\nimagination the great continent through which it flowed, and the\r\nstrange creatures that lived in the old land. We saw the delta sink\r\nbeneath the sea, and a great thickness of shallow water deposits laid\r\ndown, enclosing remains of ammonites and other beautiful forms of\r\nlife. Then long ages passed away, while in the waters of a deeper sea\r\nthe great thickness of the chalk was built up, mainly by the\r\naccumulation of microscopic shells. In time the sea bed rose, and new\r\nland appeared, and another river bore down fruits to be buried with\r\nsea shells and remains of turtles and crocodiles in the mud deposited\r\nnear its mouth to form the London clay. We followed the alternations\r\nof sea and land, and the changing life of Eocene and Oligocene times.\r\nWe have heard of the early mammalia found in the quarries of Quarr,\r\nand have learnt from the leaf beds of Alum Bay that at that time the\r\nclimate of this part of the world was tropical. Indeed, I think\r\neverything goes to prove that through the whole of the times we have\r\nbeen studying,--except perhaps the earliest Eocene, that of the\r\nReading beds,--the climate was considerably warmer than it is at the\r\npresent day. After all these changes do you not want to know what\r\nhappened next? Well, at this point we come to a gap in the records of\r\nthe rocks, not only in the Isle of Wight, but also in the British\r\nIsles. The British Isles, or even England and Wales alone, are almost,\r\nif not quite unique in the world in that, in their small extent, they\r\ncontain specimens of nearly every formation from the most ancient\r\ntimes to the present day. In other parts of the world we may find\r\nregions many times this area, where we can only study the rocks of\r\nsome one period. But just at this point in the story comes a\r\nperiod,--a very important one, too,--the Miocene--of which we have no\r\nremains in our Islands. We must hear a little of what happened before\r\nwe come back to the Isle of Wight again in comparatively recent times.\r\n\r\nBut, first, perhaps, I had better tell,--just in outline,--something\r\nof the earlier history of the world, before any of our Isle of Wight\r\nrocks were made. For, if I do not, quite a wrong idea may be formed of\r\nthe world's history. The time of the Wealden river has seemed to us\r\nvery ancient. We cannot say how many hundreds of thousands, or rather\r\nmillions of years have passed since that ancient Wealden age. And you\r\nmay have thought that we had got back then very near the world's\r\nbirthday, and were looking at some of the oldest rocks on the globe.\r\nBut no. We are not near the beginning yet. Compared with the vast ages\r\nthat went before, our Wealden period is almost modern. We cannot tell\r\nwith any certainty the comparative time; but we may compare the\r\nthickness of strata formed to give us some sort of idea. Now to the\r\nfirst strata in which fossil remains of living things are found we\r\nhave in all a thickness of strata some 12 times that of all the rocks\r\nwe have been studying from Wealden to Oligocene, together with the\r\nlater rocks, Miocene and Pliocene, not found in the Isle of Wight. And\r\nbefore that there is, perhaps, an equal thickness of sedimentary\r\ndeposits; though the fossils they, no doubt, once contained have been\r\ndestroyed by changes the rocks have undergone.\r\n\r\nNow let me try to give you some idea of the world's history up to the\r\npoint where we began in the Isle of Wight. If we could see back\r\nthrough the ages to the furthest past of geological history, we should\r\nsee our world,--before any of the stratified rocks were laid down in\r\nthe seas,--before the seas themselves were made,--a hot globe, molten\r\nat least at the surface. How do we know this? Because under the rocks\r\nof all the world's surface we find there is granite or some similar\r\nrock,--a rock which shows by its composition that it has crystallised\r\nfrom a molten condition. Moreover we have seen that the interior of\r\nthe earth is intensely hot. And yet all along the earth must be\r\nradiating off heat into the cold depths of space, and cooling like any\r\nother hot body surrounded by space cooler than itself. And this has\r\ngone on for untold ages. Far enough back we must come to a time when\r\nthe earth was red hot,--white hot. In imagination we see it\r\ncooling,--the molten mass solidifies into Igneous rock,--the clouds of\r\nsteam in which the globe is wrapped condense in oceans upon the\r\nsurface. The bands of crystalline rock that rise above the primeval\r\nseas are gradually worn down by rain and rivers and waves, and the\r\nfirst sedimentary deposits laid down in the waters. And in the waters\r\nand on the land life appeared for the first time,--we know not how.\r\n\r\nA vast thickness of stratified rocks was formed, which are called\r\nArchaean (\"ancient\"). They represent a time, perhaps, as great as all\r\nthat has followed. These rocks have undergone great changes since\r\ntheir formation. They have been pressed under masses of overlying\r\nstrata, and have come into the neighbourhood of the heated interior of\r\nthe earth; they have been burnt and baked and compressed and folded,\r\nand acted on by heated water and steam, and their whole structure\r\naltered by heat and chemical action. Limestones, _e.g._, have become\r\nmarble, with a crystalline structure which has obliterated any fossils\r\nthey may have once contained. Yet it is probable that, like nearly all\r\nlater limestones, they are of organic origin. These Archaean rocks\r\ncover a large extent of country in Canada. We have some of them in our\r\nIslands, in the Hebrides, and north-west of Scotland and in Anglesey,\r\nand rising from beneath later rocks in the Malvern Hills and Charnwood\r\nForest.[12]\r\n\r\nThe Archaean rocks are succeeded by the most ancient fossiliferous\r\nrocks, the great series called the Cambrian, because found, and first\r\nstudied, in Wales. They consist of very hard rocks, and contain large\r\nquantities of slate. They are followed by another series called the\r\nOrdovician; and that by another the Silurian. These three great\r\nsystems of rocks measure in all some 30,000 ft. of strata. They form\r\nthe hills of Wales and the English Lake District. They contain large\r\nmasses of volcanic rocks. We can see where were the necks of old\r\nvolcanoes, and the sheets of lava which flowed from them. The\r\nvolcanoes are worn down to their bases now; and the hills of Wales\r\nand the Lakes represent the remains of ancient mountain chains, which\r\nrose high like the Alps in days of old, long before Alps or Himalayas\r\nbegan to be made. These ancient rocks contain abundant remains of\r\nliving things, chiefly mollusca, crustaceans, corals, and other marine\r\norganisms, showing that the waters of those ages abounded with life.\r\n\r\nWe must pass on. Next comes a period called the Devonian, or Old Red\r\nSandstone, when the Old Red rocks of Devon and Scotland were laid\r\ndown. These contain remains of many varieties of very remarkable fish.\r\nA long period of coral seas succeeded, when coral reefs flourished\r\nover what was to be England; and their remains formed the\r\nCarboniferous Limestone of Derbyshire and the Mendip Hills. A period\r\nfollowed of immense duration, when over pretty well the whole earth\r\nthere seem to have been comparatively low lands covered with a\r\nluxuriant and very strange vegetation. The remains of these ancient\r\nforests have formed the coal measures, which tell of the most\r\nwidespread and longest enduring growth of vegetation the world has\r\nseen. Strange as some of the plants were--gigantic horsetails and\r\nclub-mosses growing into trees--many were exquisitely beautiful. There\r\nwere no flowering plants, but the ferns, many of them tree ferns, were\r\nof as delicate beauty as those of the present day. Many of the ferns\r\nbore seeds, and were not reproduced by spores, such as we see on the\r\nfronds of our present ferns. That is a wonderful story of plant\r\nhistory, which has only been read in recent years.\r\n\r\nAfter the long Carboniferous period came to an end followed periods in\r\nwhich great formations of red sandstone were made,--the Permian, and\r\nthe New Red Sandstone or Trias. During much of this time the\r\ncondition of the country seems to have resembled that of the Steppes\r\nof Central Asia, or even the great desert of Sahara--great dry sandy\r\ndeserts--hills of bare rock with screes of broken fragments heaped up\r\nat their base,--salt inland lakes, depositing, as the effect of\r\nintense evaporation, the beds of rock salt we find in Cheshire or\r\nelsewhere, in the same manner as is taking place to-day in the Caspian\r\nSea, in the salt lakes of the northern edge of the Sahara, and in the\r\nGreat Salt Lake of Utah.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the period the land here sank beneath the sea--again a\r\nsea of coral islands like the South Pacific of to-day. There were many\r\noscillations of level, or changes of currents; and bands of clay, when\r\nmud from the land was laid down, alternate with beds of limestone\r\nformed in the clearer coral seas. These strata form a period known as\r\nthe Jurassic, from the large development of the rocks in the Jura\r\nmountains. In England the period includes the Liassic and Oolitic\r\nepochs. The Liassic strata stretch across England from Lyme Regis in\r\nDorset to Whitby in Yorkshire. Most of the strata we are describing\r\nrun across England from south-west to north-east. After they were laid\r\ndown a movement of elevation, connected with the movement which raised\r\nthe Alps in Europe, took place along the lines of the Welsh and Scotch\r\nmountains and the chain of Scandinavia, which raised the various\r\nstrata, and left them dipping to the south-east. Worn down by\r\ndenudation the edges are now exposed in lines running south-west to\r\nnorth-east, while the strata dip south-east under the edges of the\r\nmore recent strata. The Lias is noted for its ammonites, and\r\nespecially for its great marine reptiles, Ichthyosaurus and\r\nPlesiosaurus. The Oolitic Epoch follows--a long period during which\r\nthe fine limestone, the Bath freestone, was made; the limestones of\r\nthe Cotswolds, beds of clay known as the Oxford and Kimmeridge clays;\r\nand again coral reefs left the rock known as coral rag. In the later\r\npart of the period were formed the Portland and Purbeck beds, marine\r\nand freshwater limestones, which contain also an old land surface,\r\nwhich has left silicified trunks of trees and stems of cycads.\r\n\r\nAnd now following on these came our Wealden strata, the beginning of\r\nthe Cretaceous period. You see what ages and ages had gone before, and\r\nthat when Wealden times came, far back as they are, the world's\r\nhistory was comparatively approaching modern times. We must remember\r\nthat all these formations, of which we have given a rapid sketch, are\r\nof great thickness,--thousands of feet of rock,--and represent vast\r\nages of time. See what we have got to from looking at the shells in\r\nthe sea cliff! We have come to learn something of the world's old\r\nhistory. We have been carried back through ages that pass our\r\nimagination to the world's beginning, to the time of the molten globe,\r\nbefore ever it was cool enough to allow life--we know not how--to\r\nbegin upon its surface. And Astronomy will take us back into an even\r\nmore distant past, and show us a nebulous mist of vast extent\r\nstretching out into space like the nebulae observed in the heavens\r\nto-day, before sun and planets and moons were yet formed. So we are\r\ncarried into the infinite of time and space, and questions arise\r\nbeyond the power of human mind to solve.\r\n\r\nNow we have, I hope, a better idea of the position the strata we have\r\nbeen specially studying occupy in the geological history, and shall\r\nunderstand the relation the strata we may find elsewhere bear to those\r\nin the Isle of Wight and the neighbouring south of England.\r\n\r\nAfter this sketch of what went before our Island story, we must see\r\nwhat followed at the end of the Oligocene period. We said that there\r\nare no strata in the British Isles representing the next period, the\r\nMiocene. But it was a period of great importance in the world's\r\nhistory. Great stratified deposits were laid down in France and\r\nSwitzerland and elsewhere, and it was a great age of mountain\r\nbuilding. The Alps and the Himalaya, largely composed of Cretaceous\r\nand Eocene rocks, were upheaved into great mountain ranges. It is\r\nprobable that during much of the period the British Isles were dry\r\nland, and that great denudation of the land took place. But in the\r\nfirst part of the period at all events this part of the world must\r\nhave been under water, and strata have been laid down, which have\r\nsince been denuded away. For our soft Oligocene strata, if exposed to\r\nrain and river action during the long Miocene period and the time\r\nwhich followed, would surely have been entirely swept away. The\r\nMiocene was succeeded by the Pliocene, when the strata called the\r\nCrag, which cover the surface of Norfolk and Suffolk, were formed.\r\nThey are marine deposits with sea shells, of which a considerable\r\nproportion of species still survive.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that through the ages we have been studying the climate\r\nwas mostly warmer than at the present day. The climate of the Eocene\r\nwas tropical. The Miocene was sub-tropical and becoming cooler. Palms\r\nbecome rarer in the Upper strata. Evergreens, which form three-fourths\r\nof the flora in the Lower Miocene, divide the flora with deciduous\r\ntrees in the Upper. And through the Pliocene the climate, though still\r\nwarmer than now, was steadily becoming cooler; till in the beginning\r\nof the next period, the Pleistocene, it had become considerably colder\r\nthan that of the present day. And then followed a time which is known\r\nas the great Ice Age, or the Glacial Period,--a time which has left\r\nits traces all over this country, and, indeed all over Northern Europe\r\nand America, and even into southern lands. The cold increased, heavy\r\nsnowfalls piled up snow on the mountains of Wales, the Lake District,\r\nand Scotland; and the snow remained, and did not melt, and more fell\r\nand pressed the lower snow into ice, which flowed down the valleys in\r\nglaciers, as in Switzerland to-day. Gradually all the vegetation of\r\ntemperate lands disappeared, till only the dwarf Arctic birch and\r\nArctic willows were to be seen. The sea shells of temperate climates\r\nwere replaced by northern species. Animals of warm and temperate\r\nclimates wandered south, and the Arctic fox, and the Norwegian\r\nlemming, and the musk ox which now lives in the far north of America\r\ntook their place; and the mammoth, an extinct elephant fitted by a\r\nthick coat of hair and wool for living in cold countries, and a\r\nwoolly-haired rhinoceros, and other animals of arctic regions occupied\r\nthe land. When the cold was greatest, the glaciers met and formed an\r\nice-sheet; and Scotland, northern England and the Midlands, Wales, and\r\nIreland were buried in one vast sheet of ice as Greenland is to-day.\r\n\r\nHow do we know this? To tell how the story has been read would be to\r\ntell one of the most interesting stories of geology. Here we can only\r\ngive the briefest sketch of this wonderful chapter of the world's\r\nhistory. But we must know a little of how the story has been made out.\r\nWe have already seen that the changes in plant and animal life point\r\nto a change from a hot climate, through a temperate, at last to arctic\r\ncold. Again, over the greater part of Northern England the rocks of\r\nthe various geological periods are buried under sheets of tough clay,\r\ncalled boulder clay, for it is studded with boulders large and small,\r\nlike raisins in a plum pudding. No flowing water forms such a deposit,\r\nbut it is found to be just like the mass of clay with stones under the\r\ngreat glaciers and ice sheets of arctic regions; and just such a\r\nboulder clay may be seen extending from the lower end of glaciers in\r\nSpitzbergen, when the glacier has temporarily retreated in a\r\nsuccession of warm summers. The stones in our boulder clay are\r\npolished and scratched in a way glaciers are known to polish and\r\nscratch the stones they carry along, and rub against the rocks and\r\nother stones. The rock over which the glacier moves is similarly\r\nscratched and polished, and just such scratching and polishing is\r\nfound on the rocks in Wales and the Lake District. Again, we find\r\nrocks carried over hill and dale and right across valleys, it may be\r\nhalf across England. We can trace for great distances the lines of\r\nfragments of some peculiar rock, as the granite of Shap in\r\nWestmorland; and even rocks from Norway have been carried across the\r\nNorth Sea, and left in East Anglia. This will just give an idea how we\r\nknow of this strange chapter in the history of our land. For, by this\r\ntime it was our land--England--much as we know it to-day; though at\r\ntimes the whole stood higher above sea level, so that the beds of the\r\nChannel and the North Sea were dry land. But, apart from variation of\r\nlevel, the geography was in the main as now.\r\n\r\n\r\n [Illustration: FIG. 9]\r\n\r\n SHINGLE  AT  FORELAND\r\n\r\n Bm    _Bembridge Marls._\r\n S     _Shingle._\r\n b     _Brick Earth._\r\n Cf    _Old Cliff in Marls._\r\n\r\n\r\n [Illustration: FIG. 5]\r\n\r\n DIAGRAM OF STRATA BETWEEN SOUTHERN DOWNS AND ST. GEORGE'S DOWN.\r\n\r\n Dotted Lines    _Former extension of Strata._\r\n Broken Line     _Former Bed of Valley sloping to St. George's Down._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ice sheet did not come further south than the Thames valley. What\r\nwas the country like south of this? Well, you must think of the land\r\njust outside the ice sheet in Greenland, or other arctic country. No\r\ndoubt the winters must have been very severe,--hard frosts and heavy\r\nsnows,--the ground frozen deep. Some arctic animals would manage to\r\nlive as they do now just outside the ice sheet in Greenland. Now, have\r\nwe any deposits formed at that time in the Isle of Wight? I think we\r\nhave. A large part of the surface of the Island is covered by sheets\r\nof flint gravel. The gravels differ in age and mode of formation. We\r\nhave already considered the angular gravels of the Chalk downs,\r\ncomposed of flints which have accumulated as the chalk which once\r\ncontained them was dissolved away. But there are other gravel beds,\r\nwhich consist of flints which, after they were set free by the\r\ndissolution of the chalk, have been carried down to a lower level by\r\nrivers or other agency, and more or less rounded in the process. Many\r\nof these beds occur at a high level; and, as they usually cap\r\nflat-topped hills, they are known as Plateau Gravels. Perhaps the\r\nmost remarkable is the immense sheet of gravel which covers the flat\r\ntop of St. George's Down between Arreton and Newport. Gravel pits show\r\nupwards of 30 feet of gravel, consisting of flints with some chert and\r\nironstone, and the greatest thickness is probably considerably more\r\nthan this. The southern edge of the sheet is cut off straight like a\r\nwall. To the north it runs out on ridges between combes which have cut\r\ninto it. In places in the mass of flints occur beds of sand, which\r\nhave all the appearance of having been laid down by currents of water.\r\nThe base of the gravel where it is seen on the steep southern slope of\r\nthe down has been cemented by water containing iron into a solid\r\nconglomerate rock. The flints forming this gravel have not simply sunk\r\ndown from chalk strata dissolved away; for they lie on the upturned\r\nedges of strata from Lower Greensand to Upper Chalk, which have been\r\nplaned off, and worn into a surface sloping gently to the north; and\r\nover this surface the gravel has somehow flowed. The sharp wall in\r\nwhich it ends at the upper part of the slope shows that it once\r\nextended to the south over ground since worn away. Clearly, the gravel\r\nwas formed before denudation had cut out the great gap between the\r\ncentral and southern downs of the Island. The down where the gravel\r\nlies is 363 ft. above sea level, 313 ft. above the bottom of the\r\nvalley below. So that, though the gravel sheet is much newer than the\r\nstrata we have been studying, it must nevertheless be of great\r\nantiquity.\r\n\r\nIt seems that at the top of St. George's Down we are standing on what\r\nwas once the floor of an old valley. In the course of denudation the\r\nbottom of a river valley often becomes the highest part of a district.\r\nFor the bed of the valley is covered by flint gravel, and flint is\r\nexcessively hard, and the bed of flints protects the underlying rock;\r\nso that, while the rocks on each side are worn away, what was the\r\nriver bed is eventually left high above them. Thus the highest points\r\nof a district are often capped by flint gravel marking the beds of old\r\nstreams. Tracing up this old valley to the southward, at a few miles\r\ndistance it will have reached the chalk region on the south of the\r\nanticline: and the flints carried down the valley may have come from\r\nbeds of angular flints already dissolved out of the chalk such as we\r\nfind on St. Boniface Down.\r\n\r\nBut how have these great masses of flints been swept along? Can the\r\nland have been down under the sea; and have sea waves washed the\r\nstones along? But these flints, though water-worn, are not rounded as\r\nwe find beach shingle. What immense rush of water can have spread\r\nthese flints 30 feet deep along a river valley? We must go to mountain\r\nregions for torrents of this character. And then, mountain torrents\r\nround the stones in their bed while these are mostly angular. The\r\nhistory of these gravels is a difficult one. I can only give what\r\nseems to me the most probable explanation. It appears to me probable\r\nthat in the Ice Age, south of the ice sheet, the ground must have been\r\nboth broken up by frosts, and also held together by being frozen hard\r\nto some depth. Then when thaws came in the short but warm summers, or\r\nwhen an intermission of the severe cold took place, great floods would\r\nflow down the valleys in the country south of the ice sheet, and\r\nmasses of ice with frozen earth and stones would be borne along in a\r\nsort of semi-liquid flow. In this way Mr. Clement Reid explains the\r\nmass of broken-up chalk with large stones found on the heads of cliffs\r\non the South coast, and known by the name of \"combe-rock\" or \"head.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ice Age was not one simple period, and it is still difficult to\r\nfit together the history we read in different places, and in\r\nparticular to correlate the gravels of the south of England with the\r\nboulder clays of the glaciated area. There were certainly breaks in\r\nthe period, during which the climate became much milder, or even\r\nwarm; and these were long enough for southern species of animals and\r\nplants to migrate northward, and occupy the lands where an arctic\r\nclimate had prevailed. There were moreover considerable variations in\r\nthe relative level of land and sea. So that we have a very complex\r\nhistory, which is gradually coming into clearer light.\r\n\r\nThat the gravels of the south of England belong largely to the age of\r\nice, is shown by remains of the mammoth contained in many. These,\r\nhowever, are found in later gravels than those we have considered so\r\nfar, gravels laid down after the land had been cut down to much lower\r\nlevels. These lower gravels are known as Valley gravels, because they\r\nlie along the course of existing valleys, the Plateau gravels having\r\nbeen laid down before the present valleys came into existence. Teeth\r\nof the mammoth are found in the Thames valley, and on the shores of\r\nSouthampton Water, in gravels about 50 to 70 feet above sea level, and\r\nhave been found also in the Isle of Wight at Freshwater Gate, at the\r\ntop of the cliffs near Brook, and in other places. The gravels near\r\nBrook with the clays on which they rest have been contorted, and the\r\ngravel forced into pockets in the clay, in a manner that suggests the\r\naction of grounding ice ploughing into the soil.\r\n\r\nThe high level gravels must belong to an early stage of the Glacial\r\nEpoch. We get some idea of the great length of time this age must have\r\nlasted, as we look from St. George's Down over the lower country of\r\nthe centre of the Island. After the formation of the St. George's Down\r\ngravel the vast mass of strata between this and the opposite downs of\r\nSt. Boniface and St. Catherine's was removed by denudation; and\r\ngravels were then laid down on the lower land, along Blake Down, at\r\nArreton, over Hale common, and along the course of the Yar. Patches of\r\ngravel occur on the Sandown and Shanklin cliffs. At Little Stairs a\r\ngravel, largely of angular chert, reaches a thickness of 12 feet, and\r\nin parts are several feet of loam above gravel.\r\n\r\nAt the west of the Island a great sheet of gravel covers the top of\r\nHeadon Hill, reaching a height of 390 feet. It appears sometimes to\r\nmeasure 30 feet in thickness. Like that on St. George's Down it slopes\r\ntowards the Solent, resting on an eroded surface, in this case of\r\nTertiary strata; and here too the upper part of the sheet has been\r\nremoved by the wearing out of the deep valley between the Hill and the\r\nFreshwater Downs. The sheet lies on an old valley bottom, which sloped\r\nfrom the chalk downs on the south, then much higher and more extensive\r\nthan now. Here too we may see something of the length of the Glacial\r\nPeriod. For at Freshwater Gate is a much later gravel, in which teeth\r\nof the mammoth have been found. It was probably derived from older\r\ngravels that once lay to the south, as the flints are rounded by\r\ntransport. But the formation of all these gravels appears to belong to\r\nthe Glacial Period; and as we stand in Freshwater Gate, and look at\r\nthis great gap in the downs worn out by the Western Yar, and think of\r\nthe time when a river valley passed over the tops of the High Downs\r\nand Headon Hill, we receive a strong impression of the length of the\r\ngreat Ice Age.\r\n\r\nNow surely the question will be asked, what caused these changes of\r\nclimate in the world's past history--so that at times a tropical\r\nvegetation spread over this land, and vegetation flourished sufficient\r\nto leave beds of coal within the Arctic circle, and in the Antarctic\r\ncontinent, and at another the climate of Greenland came down to\r\nEngland, and an ice sheet covered nearly the whole country? This still\r\nremains one of the difficult problems of Geology. An explanation has\r\nbeen attempted by Astronomical Theory, according to which the varying\r\neccentricity of the earth's orbit--that is to say a slight change in\r\nthe elliptic orbit of the Earth, by which at times it becomes less\r\nnearly circular--a change which is known to take place--may have had\r\nthe effect of producing these variations of climatic conditions. The\r\ntheory is very alluring, for if this be the cause, we can calculate\r\nmathematically the date and duration of the Glacial Period. But,\r\nunfortunately, supposing the astronomical phenomena to have the effect\r\nrequired, the course of events given by the astronomical theory would\r\nbe entirely different to that revealed by geological research.\r\nGeographical explanations have usually failed through being of too\r\nlocal a character to explain a phenomenon which affected the whole\r\nnorthern hemisphere, and the effects of which reached at least as far\r\nsouth as the Equator,[13] and are seen again in the southern hemisphere\r\nin Australia, New Zealand, and South America. It is now believed that\r\ngreat world-movements take place, due to the contraction by cooling of\r\nthe Earth's interior, and the adjustment of the crust to the\r\nshrinkage.[14] Possibly some explanation might be found in these\r\nworld-wide movements; but their effect seems to last through too long\r\nperiods of time to suit our Ice Ages. Again, while the geographical\r\ndistribution of animals and plants in the present and past seems to\r\nimply very great changes in the land masses and oceanic areas,[15]\r\nthese changes appear to bear no relation to glacial epochs. The cause\r\nof the Ice Ages remains at present an unsolved problem. More than one\r\nIce Age has occurred during the long geological history. The marks of\r\nsuch a period are found in Archaean rocks, in the Cambrian, when\r\nglaciers flowed down to the sea level in China and South Australia\r\nwithin a few degrees of the tropics, and above all in early Permian\r\ntimes. The Dwyka conglomerate of the Karroo formation of South Africa\r\n(deposits of Permo-Carboniferous age) show evidence of extensive\r\nglaciation; deposits of the same age in Northern and Central India,\r\neven within the tropics, a glacial series of great thickness in\r\nAustralia, and deposits in Brazil, appear to show a glaciation greater\r\nthan that of the recent glacial period. Yet these epochs formed only\r\nepisodes in the great geological eras. On the whole the climate\r\nthroughout geological time would seem to have been warmer than at the\r\npresent day. It may, perhaps, be doubted whether the earth has yet\r\nrecovered what we may call its _normal_ temperature since the Glacial\r\nEpoch.\r\n\r\nNote on Astronomical Theory.--If the Ice Age be due to the increased\r\neccentricity of the Earth's orbit, the theory shows that a long\r\nduration of normal temperature will be followed by a group of Glacial\r\nPeriods alternating between the northern and southern hemispheres, the\r\ntime elapsing between the culmination of such a period in one\r\nhemisphere and in the other being about 10,500 years. While one\r\nhemisphere is in a glacial period, the other will be enjoying a\r\nspecially mild,--a \"genial\" period. Now, according to the record of\r\nthe rocks, the \"genial\" periods were far from being those breaks in\r\nthe Glacial which we know as Inter-glacial periods. We have the\r\nimmensely long warm period of the Eocene and Oligocene, the Miocene\r\nwith a still warm but reduced temperature, and then the gradual\r\ncooling during the Pliocene, till the drop in temperature culminates\r\nin the Ice Age. Moreover, the duration of each glaciation during this\r\nIce Age is usually considered to have been much longer than the 10,000\r\nyears or so given by the Astronomical Theory. Add to this that the\r\nperiods of high eccentricity of the Earth's orbit, though occurring\r\nat irregular intervals, are, on the scale of geological time, pretty\r\nfrequent; so that several of such periods would have occurred during\r\nthe Eocene alone. Yet the geological evidence shows unbroken\r\nsub-tropical conditions in this part of the world throughout the\r\nEocene.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: The older division of the Archaean rocks--the\r\n    Lewisian gneisse--consists entirely of metamorphic and igneous\r\n    rocks; a later division--the Torridonian sandstones--is\r\n    comparatively little altered, but still unfossiliferous.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: The great equatorial mountains Kilimanjaro and\r\n    Ruwenzori show signs of a former extension of glaciers.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 14: For an account of such movements, see Prof.\r\n    Gregory's _Making of the Earth_ in the Home University Library.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: See The _Wanderings of Animals_.

Gadow,\r\n    F.R.S., Cambridge Manuals.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF THE ISLAND RIVERS; AND HOW\r\nTHE ISLE OF WIGHT BECAME AN ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must now consider the history of the river system of the Isle of\r\nWight, to which our study of the gravels has brought us. For rivers\r\nhave a history, sometimes a most interesting one, which carries us\r\nback far into the past. Even the little rivers of the Isle of Wight\r\nmay be truly called ancient rivers. For though recent in comparison\r\nwith the ages of geological time, they are of a vast antiquity\r\ncompared with the historical periods of human history.\r\n\r\nTo understand our river systems we must go back to the time when\r\nstrata formed by deposit of sediment in the sea were upheaved above\r\nthe sea level. To take the simplest case, that of a single anticlinal\r\naxis fading off gradually at each end, we shall have a sort of turtle\r\nback of land emerged from the sea, as in figure 6, _aa_ being the\r\nanticlinal axis. From this ridge streams will run down on either side\r\nin the direction of the dip, their course being determined by some\r\nminor folds of the strata, or difference of hardness in the surface,\r\nor cracks formed during elevation. On each side of the dip-streams\r\nsmaller ones will flow, more or less in the direction of the strike,\r\nand run into the main streams. Various irregularities, such as started\r\nthe flow of the streams, will favour one or another. Consider three\r\nstreams, _a_, _b_, _c_, and let us suppose the middle one the\r\nstrongest, with greatest flow of water, and cutting down its bed most\r\nrapidly. Its side streams will become steeper and have more erosive\r\nforce, and so will eat back their courses most rapidly until they\r\nstrike the line of the streams on either side. Their steeper channels\r\nwill then offer the best way for the upper waters of the streams they\r\nhave cut to reach the sea; and these streams will consequently be\r\ntapped, and their head waters cut off to flow to the channel of the\r\ncentre stream. We shall thus have for a second stage in the history a\r\nsystem such as is shown in fig. 7. The same process will continue till\r\none river has tapped several others; and there will result the usual\r\nfigure of a river and its tributaries, to which we are accustomed on\r\nour maps. We shall observe that tributaries do not as a rule gradually\r\napproach the central stream, but suddenly turn off at nearly a right\r\nangle from the direction in which they are flowing, and, after a\r\nlonger or shorter course, join at another sharp angle a river flowing\r\nmore or less parallel to their original direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7]\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT  OF  RIVER  SYSTEMS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chalk and overlying Tertiary strata were uplifted from the sea in\r\ngreat folds forming a series of such turtle-backs as we have been\r\nconsidering. The line of upheaval was not south-west and north-east,\r\nas that which raised the older formations in bands across England, but\r\ntook place in an east and west direction. The main upheaval was that\r\nof the great Wealden anticline. Other folds produced the Sandown and\r\nBrook anticlines, and that of the Portsdown Hills. The upheaval seemed\r\nto have been caused by pressure acting from the south, for the steeper\r\nslope of each fold is on the northern side. Our latest Oligocene\r\nstrata are tilted with the chalk, showing that the upheaval took place\r\nafter Oligocene times. But the great movement was in the main earlier\r\nthan the Pliocene. For on the North Downs near Lenham is a patch of\r\nLower Pliocene deposit resting directly on the Chalk, the older\r\nTertiary strata having been removed by denudation, clearly due to the\r\nuplift of the Wealden anticline. The raising of the Pliocene deposit\r\nto its present position proves that the same movement was continued at\r\na later time, probably during the Pleistocene. But the greater part of\r\nthe movement may be assigned to the Miocene, the period of great\r\nworld-movements which raised the Alps and the Himalaya.\r\n\r\nMany remarkable, and, at first sight, very puzzling features connected\r\nwith the courses of rivers find an explanation when we study the river\r\nhistory. Thus, looking at the Weald of Kent and Sussex, we see that it\r\nconsists of comparatively low ground rising to a line of heights east\r\nand west along the centre, and surrounded on all sides but the\r\nsouth-east by a wall of Chalk downs. If we considered the subject, we\r\nshould suppose that the drainage of the country would be towards the\r\nsouth-east, which is open to the sea. Not so. All the rivers flow from\r\nthe central heights north and south,--go straight for the walls of\r\nchalk downs, and cut through the escarpment in deep clefts to flow\r\ninto the Thames and the Channel. This is explained when we remember\r\nthat the rivers began to flow when the great curve of strata rose\r\nabove the sea. Though eroded by the sea during its elevation, yet when\r\nit rose above the waters the arch of chalk must have been continuous\r\nfrom what are now North Downs to South. And from the centre line of\r\nthe great turtle back the streams began to flow north and south,\r\ncutting in the course of ages deep channels for themselves. The\r\ngreater erosion in their higher courses has cut away the mass of chalk\r\nfrom the centre of the Weald, but the rivers still flow in the\r\ndirection determined when the arch was still entire.\r\n\r\nWe have a similar state of things in the Isle of Wight. Any one not\r\nknowing the geological story, and looking at the geography of the\r\nIsland, might naturally suppose that there would be a stream flowing\r\nfrom west to east, through the low ground between the two ranges of\r\ndowns, and finding its way into the sea in Sandown Bay. Instead of\r\nthis the three rivers of the Island, the two Yars and the Medina, all\r\nflow north, and cut through the chalk escarpment of the Central downs,\r\nas if an earthquake had made rifts for them to pass, and so find their\r\nway into the Solent. The explanation is the same as in the case of the\r\nWeald. The rivers began to flow when the Chalk strata were continuous\r\nover the centre of the Island; and their course was determined when\r\nthe east and west anticlinal axis rose above the sea.\r\n\r\nWe shall notice, however, that the Island rivers start from south of\r\nthe anticlinal axis. The centre of the Sandown anticline runs just\r\nnorth of Sandown, but the various branches of the Yar and Medina flow\r\nfrom well south of this. The explanation would appear to be that the\r\nanticline is almost a monoclinal curve,--that is to say, one slope is\r\nsteep, the other not far from horizontal. Streams starting from the\r\nridge would flow with much greater force down the northern than the\r\nsouthern side, and would cut back their course much more quickly.\r\nThus they would continually cut into the heads of the southern\r\nstreams, and turn the water supplying them into their own channels.\r\n\r\nIn its early history a river cuts out its bed, and carries along\r\npebbles, sand and mud to the sea. The head waters are constantly\r\ncutting back, and the slope becoming less steep, till a time comes\r\nwhen the stream in its gently inclined lower course has no more power\r\nto excavate, and the finer sediment, which is all that now reaches the\r\nlower river, begins to fill up the old channel. And so the alluvium is\r\nformed which fills the lower portions of our river valleys.\r\n\r\nBeyond this, the great rush of waters from melting snows and ice of\r\nthe Glacial Period has come to an end. The gentler and diminished\r\nstreams of a drier age have no power to roll flint stones along and\r\nform beds of gravel. Gravel terraces border our river valleys at a\r\nhigher level than the present streams. Periods alternated during which\r\ngravels were laid down by the river, and when the river acquiring more\r\nerosive force, by an elevation of the land giving its bed a steeper\r\ngradient, or a wetter climate producing a greater rush of water, cut a\r\nnew channel deeper in the old valley. So our valleys in Southern\r\nEngland are frequently bordered by a succession of gravel terraces,\r\nthe higher ones being the older, dating from times when the river\r\nflowed at a higher level than at present. Such terraces may be seen\r\nabove the Eastern Yar and its tributary streams. In the centre of the\r\nold gravels is the alluvial flat of a later age.\r\n\r\nThe Island rivers cut out their channels when the land stood at a\r\nhigher level than at present. The old channels of the lower parts of\r\nthe rivers are now filled with alluvium, partly brought down by the\r\nrivers and partly marine. The channels are cut down considerably below\r\nsea level; and by the sinking of the land the sea has flowed in, and\r\nthe last parts of the river courses are now tidal estuaries. The sea\r\ndoes not cut out estuaries. They are the submerged ends of river\r\nvalleys.\r\n\r\nSome idea may be formed of the antiquity of our Island rivers by\r\nobserving the depth of the clefts they have cut through the downs at\r\nBrading, Newport, and Freshwater. But to this we must add the depth at\r\nwhich the old channels lie below the alluvium. It would be interesting\r\nto know the thickness of the alluvium. But it is not often that\r\nborings come to be made in river alluvia. However, in the old Spithead\r\nforts artesian wells are sunk; and these pass through 70 to 90 feet of\r\nrecent deposits before entering Eocene strata. Under St. Helen's Fort,\r\nat the mouth of Brading Harbour, are 80 feet of recent deposits. The\r\nold channel of the Yar, at its mouth, must lie at least at this depth.\r\n\r\nBefore it passes through the gap in the Chalk downs the Yar has\r\nmeandered about, and formed the alluvial flat called Morton marshes.\r\nThese marshes stretch out into the flat known as Sandown Level, which\r\noccupies the shore of the bay between Sandown and the Granite Fort.\r\nWhat is the meaning of this extension of the alluvium away from the\r\ncourse of the river out to the sea at Sandown? A glance at it as\r\npictured on a geological map will suggest the answer. We see clearly\r\nthe alluvia of two streams converging from right and left, and uniting\r\nto pass to the sea through Brading Harbour. But the stream to the\r\nright has been cut off by the sea encroaching on Sandown Bay: only the\r\nlast mile of alluvium is left to tell of a river passed away. We must\r\nreconstruct the past. We see the Bay covered by land sloping up to\r\neast and south east, the lines of downs extending eastward from\r\nDunnose and the Culvers, and an old river flowing northward, and\r\ncutting through the chalk at Brading after being joined by a branch\r\nfrom the west. This old river must have been the main stream. For it\r\nwas a transverse stream, flowing nearly at right angles to the ridge\r\nof the anticline; while the Yar comes in as a tributary in the\r\ndirection of the strike. Of other tributary streams, all from the\r\nright are gone by the destruction of the old land. On the left streams\r\nwould flow in from the combes at Shanklin and Luccombe--streams which\r\nhave now cut out Shanklin and Luccombe chines.\r\n\r\nPassing the gap in the downs the river meandered about, and, with\r\nmarine deposit, washed in by the tides, formed the expanse of alluvium\r\nwhich occupies what was Brading Harbour,--a harbour which in old times\r\npresented at high tide a beautiful spectacle of land-locked water\r\nextending up to Brading. Inclosures and drainings have been made from\r\ntime to time, the upper part near Yarbridge being taken in in the time\r\nof Edward I. Further innings were made in the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth; and Sir Hugh Middleton, who brought the New River to\r\nLondon, made an attempt to enclose the whole, but the sea broke\r\nthrough his embankment. The harbour was finally reclaimed at great\r\ncost in 1880, the present embankment enclosing an area of 600 acres.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Western Yar is similar to that of the Eastern. The\r\nmain stream must have flowed from land now destroyed by the sea\r\nstretching far south of Freshwater Gate. All that is left is its tidal\r\nestuary, and the gravel terraces and alluvial flat formed in the last\r\npart of its course. Of a tributary stream an interesting relic\r\nremains. For more than 2 miles from Chilton Chine through Brook to\r\nCompton Grange a bed of river gravel lies at the top of the cliff,\r\nmarking the course of an old stream, of which coast erosion has made a\r\nlongitudinal section. This was a tributary of the Yar, when the\r\nmammoth left his remains in the gravel at Grange Chine and Freshwater\r\nGate. Down the centre of the gravels lies a strip of alluvium laid\r\ndown by a stream following the same course in later days. The sea had\r\nprobably by this time cut into the stream; and it most likely flowed\r\ninto the sea somewhere west of Brook. In the alluvium hazel nuts and\r\ntwigs of trees are found at Shippard's Chine near Brook.\r\n\r\nThe lower course of the Medina is a submerged river valley, the tide\r\nflowing up to Newport. The river rises near Chale, and flows through a\r\nstrip of alluvium, overgrown with marsh vegetation, known as \"The\r\nWilderness.\" This upper course of the Medina, from the absence of\r\ngravels or brick earth, has the appearance of a comparatively modern\r\nriver. But the Medina has a further history. If you look at the map\r\nyou will see branches of the Yar running south to north as transverse\r\nstreams, but the main course is that of a lateral river. Look at the\r\ntwo chief sources of the Yar--the stream from near Whitwell and Niton,\r\nand that from the Wroxall valley. When they get down to the marshes\r\nnear Rookley and Merston, they are not flowing at all in the direction\r\nof Sandown or Brading. They rather look as if they would flow along\r\nthe marshy flat by Blackwater into the Medina. But the Yar cuts right\r\nacross their course, and carries them off eastward to Sandown. When we\r\nlook, we find a line of river valley with a strip of alluvium running\r\nup from the Medina at Blackwater in the direction of these two\r\nstreams--a valley which the railway up the Yar valley from Sandown\r\nmakes use of to get to Newport. There can be little doubt that these\r\nstreams from Niton and Wroxall originally ran along this line into the\r\nMedina; but the Yar, cutting its course backward, has captured them,\r\nand diverted their course. They probably represent the main branches\r\nof the Medina in earlier times, the direction of flow from south-east\r\nto north-west instead of south to north being possibly due to the\r\noverlapping in the neighbourhood of Newport of the ends of the Brook\r\nand Sandown anticlines. The sheet of gravel on Blake Down belongs to\r\nthis period of the river's history. The river must have diverted\r\nbetween the deposition of the Plateau Gravels and that of the Valley\r\nGravels of the Yar. For the former follow the original valley, the\r\nlatter the new course of the river.\r\n\r\nWe must now take a wider outlook, and see what became of our rivers\r\nafter they had flowed across what is now the Isle of Wight from south\r\nto north. We have been speaking of times when the Island was of much\r\ngreater extent than at present. Standing on the down above the\r\nNeedles, and looking westward, we see on a clear day the Isle of\r\nPurbeck lying opposite, and we can see that the headland there is\r\nformed by white chalk cliffs like those beneath us. In front of them\r\nstand the Old Harry Rocks, answering to the Needles, both relics of a\r\nformer extension of the land. In fact Purbeck is just like a\r\ncontinuation of the Isle of Wight. South of the Chalk lie Greensand\r\nand Wealden strata in Swanage Bay, and north towards Poole are\r\nTertiaries. Clearly these strata were once continuous with those of\r\nthe Isle of Wight. We must imagine the chalk downs of the Island\r\ncontinued as a long range across what is now sea, and on through\r\nPurbeck. A great Valley must have stretched from west to east, north\r\nof this line, along the course of the Frome, which runs through\r\nDorset, and now enters the sea at Poole Harbour, on by Bournemouth,\r\nand along the present Solent Channel--a valley still much above sea\r\nlevel, not yet cut down by rivers and the sea--and down the centre of\r\nthis valley a river must have flowed, which may be called the River\r\nSolent. It received as tributaries from the south the rivers of the\r\nIsle of Wight, and others from land since destroyed by the sea. There\r\nflowed into it from the north the waters of the Stour and Avon, and an\r\nold river which flowed down the line of what is now Southampton Water.\r\nSouthampton Water looks like the valley of a large river, much larger\r\nthan the present Test and Itchen. Its direction points to a river from\r\nthe north west; and it has been shown by Mr. Clement Reid that the\r\nSalisbury rivers--Avon, Nadder, and Wily--at a former time, when they\r\nflowed far above their present level--continued their course into the\r\nvalley of Southampton Water. For fragments of Purbeck rocks from the\r\nVale of Wardour, west of Salisbury, have been found by him in gravels\r\non high land near Bramshaw, carried right over the deep vale of the\r\nAvon in the direction of the Water. The lower Avon would originally be\r\na tributary of the Solent River; and it enters the sea about mid-way\r\nbetween the Needles and the chalk cliffs of Purbeck, just opposite the\r\npoint where we might suppose the sea would have first broken through\r\nthe line of chalk downs. No doubt it broke through a gap made by the\r\ncourse of an old river from the south, as it is now breaking through\r\nthe gap made by the old Yar at Freshwater. When the river Solent had\r\nbeen tapped at this point, the Avon just opposite would have acquired\r\na much steeper flow, causing it to cut back at a faster rate, till it\r\ncut the course of the old river which ran by Salisbury to Southampton,\r\nand, having a steeper fall, diverted the upper waters of this river\r\ninto its own channel.\r\n\r\n\r\n [Illustration: FIG. 8\r\n THE OLD SOLENT RIVER]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrost and rain and rivers cut down the valleys of the river system for\r\nhundreds of feet; the sea which had broken through the chalk range\r\ngradually cut away the south side of the main river valley from Purbeck\r\nto the Needles; and eventually the valley itself was submerged by a\r\nsubsidence of the land, and the sea flowed between the Isle of Wight\r\nand the mainland.\r\n\r\nA gravel of somewhat different character to the rest is the sheet of\r\nflint shingle at Bembridge Foreland. It forms a cliff of gravel about\r\n25 feet high resting on Bembridge marls, and consists of large flints,\r\nwith lines of smaller flints and sand showing current bedding, and also\r\ncontains Greensand chert and sandstone, which must have been brought\r\nfrom some district beyond the Chalk. The shingle slopes to north-east.\r\nTo the south-west it ends abruptly, the dividing line between shingle\r\nand marls running up steeply into the cliff. This evidently marks an\r\nold sea cliff in the marls, against which the gravel has been laid\r\ndown.[16]\r\n\r\nOne or two comparatively recent deposits may be mentioned here. At the\r\ntop of the cliff in Totland Bay, about 60 ft. above the sea, for a\r\ndistance of 350 yards, is a lacustrine deposit, consisting in the main\r\nof a calcareous tufa deposited by springs flowing from the limestone of\r\nHeadon Hill. The tufa contains black lines from vegetable matter, and\r\nnumerous land and freshwater shells of present-day species--many species\r\nof Helix, especially H. nemoralis and H. rotundata, Cyclostoma elegans,\r\nLimnaea palustris, Pupa, Clausilia, Cyclas, and others.\r\n\r\nOn the top of Gore Cliff is a deposit of hard calcareous mud, reaching\r\na thickness of about 9 feet, and forming a small vertical cliff above\r\nthe slopes of chalk marl. It extends north a few yards beyond the\r\nchalk marl on to Lower Greensand. It has been formed by rainwash from\r\na hill of chalk, which must once have existed to the south. The\r\ndeposit contains numerous existing land-shells, especially _Helix\r\nnemoralis_ and other species of Helix.\r\n\r\nBetween Atherfield and Chale at the top of the cliff is a large area\r\nof Blown Sand. The sand is blown up from the face of the cliff below.\r\nIt reaches a thickness of 20 feet, and possibly more in places, and\r\nforms a line of sand dunes along the edge of the cliff. The upper part\r\nof Ladder Chine shows an interesting example of wind-erosion. The sand\r\ndriven round it by the wind has worn it into a semi-circular hollow\r\nlike a Roman theatre.\r\n\r\nSmall spits, consisting partly of blown sand, extend opposite the\r\nmouths of the Western Yar, the Newtown river, and the most\r\nextensive--at the mouth of the old Brading Harbour, separating the\r\npresent reduced Bembridge Harbour from the sea. This is called St.\r\nHelen's Spit, or \"Dover,\"--the local name for these sand spits.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: Fig. 9, p. 79.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII\r\n\r\nTHE COMING OF MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have watched the long succession of varied life on the earth\r\nrecorded in the rocks, and now we come to the most momentous event of\r\nall in the history--the coming of Man. The first certain evidence of\r\nthe presence of man on the earth is found with the coming of the\r\nGlacial Period,--unless indeed the supposed flint implements found by\r\nMr. Reid Moir, under the Crag in Suffolk, should prove him earlier\r\nstill. It is a rare chance that the skeleton of a land animal is\r\npreserved; especially rare in the case of a skeleton so frail as that\r\nof man. The best chance for the preservation of bones is in deposits\r\nin caves, which were frequently the dens of wild beasts and the\r\nshelters of man. But the implements used by early man were happily of\r\na very imperishable nature. His favourite material, if he could get\r\nit, was flint. Flint could by dexterous blows have flake after flake\r\ntaken off, till it formed a tool or weapon with sharp point and\r\ncutting edge. The implements, though only chipped, or flaked, were\r\noften admirably made. They have very characteristic shapes. Moreover,\r\nthe kind of blow--struck obliquely--by which these early men made\r\ntheir tools left marks which stamp them as of human workmanship. The\r\nflake struck off shows what is called a \"bulb of percussion\"--a\r\nswelling which marks the spot where the blow was struck--and from this\r\nextends a series of ripples, producing a surface like that of a shell,\r\nfrom which this mode of breaking is called conchoidal fracture. Often,\r\nby further chipping the flake itself is worked into an implement.\r\nImplements have also been made of chert, but it is far more difficult\r\nto work, as it naturally breaks in an irregular way into sharp angular\r\nfragments. Flint, on the other hand, lent itself admirably to the use\r\nof early man, who in time acquired a perfect mastery of the material.\r\nThe working of flints is so characteristic that, once accustomed to\r\nthem, you cannot mistake a good specimen. Sea waves dashing pebbles\r\nabout will sometimes produce a conchoidal fracture, but never a series\r\nof fractures in the methodical way in which a flint was worked by man.\r\nAnd, of course, specimens may be found so worn that it is difficult to\r\nbe sure about their nature. Again early man may, especially in very\r\nearly times, have been content to use a sharp stone almost as he found\r\nit, with only the slightest amount of knocking it into shape. So that\r\nin such a case it will be very difficult to decide whether the stones\r\nhave formed the implements of man or not. In later times men learnt to\r\npolish their implements, and made polished stone axes like those the\r\nNew Zealanders and South Sea Islanders used to make in modern times.\r\nThe old age of chipped or flaked implements is called the Palaeolithic;\r\nthe later age when they were ground or polished the Neolithic. (Simple\r\nimplements, as knives and scrapers, were still unpolished.) The\r\nhistory of early man is a long story in itself, and of intense\r\ninterest. But we must not leave our geological story unfinished by\r\nleaving out the culmination of it all in man. In the higher\r\ngravels--the Plateau Gravels--no remains of man are found; but in the\r\nlower--the Valley Gravels,--of the South of England is found abundant\r\nevidence of the presence of man. Large numbers of flint implements\r\nhave been collected from the Thames valley and over the whole area of\r\nthe rivers which have gravel terraces along their course. Over a large\r\nsheet of gravel at Southampton, whenever a large gravel pit is dug,\r\nimplements are found at the base of the gravel.[17] The occurrence of\r\nthe mammoth and other arctic creatures in the gravels shows that in\r\nthe Glacial Period man was contemporary with these animals. Remains in\r\ncaves tell the same story. In limestone caverns in Devon, Derbyshire,\r\nand Yorkshire, implements made by man are found in company with\r\nremains of the cave bear, cave hyaena, lion, hippopotamus, rhinoceros,\r\nand other animals either extinct or no longer inhabitants of this\r\ncountry--remains which have been preserved under floors of stalagmite\r\ndeposited in the caves. In caves of central France men have left\r\ncarvings on bone and ivory, representing the wild animals of that\r\nday--carvings which show a remarkable artistic sense, and a keen\r\nobservation of animal life. Among them is a drawing of the mammoth on\r\na piece of mammoth ivory, showing admirably the appearance of the\r\nanimal, with his long hair, as he has been found preserved in ice to\r\nthe present day near the mouths of Siberian rivers. Drawings of the\r\nreindeer, true to life, are frequent.\r\n\r\nTill recently very few Palaeolithic implements had been recorded as\r\nfound in the Isle of Wight. In the Memoir of the Geological Survey\r\n(1889) only one such is recorded, found in a patch of brick earth near\r\nHowgate Farm, Bembridge.[18] A few more implements, which almost\r\ncertainly came from this brick-earth, have been found on the shore\r\nsince. In recent years a large number of Palaeolithic implements have\r\nbeen found at Priory Bay near St. Helen's. They were first observed on\r\nthe beach by Prof. E. B. Poulton, F.R.S., in 1886, and were traced to\r\ntheir source in the gravel in the cliff by Miss Moseley in 1902. From\r\nthat time, and especially from 1904 onwards, many have been found by\r\nProf. Poulton, by R. W. Poulton (and others). Up to 1909 about 150\r\nimplements had been found, and there have been more finds since.[19]\r\n\r\nThe most important finds, besides those at Priory Bay, have been those\r\nof Mr. S. Hazzledine Warren at Freshwater, especially in trial borings\r\nin loam and clay below the surface soil in a depression of the High\r\nDowns, south of Headon Hill, at a level of about 360 ft. O.D., in\r\nwhich a number of Palaeolithic tools, flakes, and cores were found[20].\r\nIsolated implements have been found in recent years in various\r\nlocalities in the Island. There are references to finds of implements\r\nat different times in the past, but the descriptions are generally too\r\nvague to conclude certainly to what date they belong. Much of the\r\ngravel used in the Island comes from the angular gravel on St.\r\nBoniface Down, or the high Plateau Gravel of St. George's Down; but in\r\nthe lower gravels and associated brick earth, it is highly probable\r\nthat more remains of Palaeolithic man will yet be found in the Island,\r\nand quite possible that such have been found in the past, but for\r\nwant of accurate descriptions of the circumstances of the finds are\r\nlost to us.\r\n\r\nWe must pass on to the men of the Neolithic or later stone age. The\r\nPalaeolithic age was of very great duration, much longer than all\r\nsucceeding human history. Between Palaeolithic and Neolithic times\r\nthere is in England a large gap. In France various stages have been\r\ntraced showing a continual advance in culture. In England little, if\r\nanything, has been found belonging to the intermediate stages. Such\r\nremains may yet be found in caves, or in lower river gravels, now\r\nburied below the alluvium. The gap between Palaeolithic and Neolithic\r\nis marked by the great amount of river erosion which took place in the\r\ninterval. Palaeolithic implements are found in gravels formed when the\r\nrivers flowed some 100 feet above their present courses. Take, _e.g._,\r\nthe Itchen at Southampton. After the 100 foot gravels were deposited\r\nthe river cut down, not merely to its present level, but to an old bed\r\nnow covered up by various deposits beneath the river. After cutting\r\ndown to that bed the river laid down gravels upon it; and then--the\r\nland standing at a higher level than to-day--the river valley and the\r\nsurrounding country were covered by a forest, which, as the climate\r\naltered and became damper, was succeeded by the formation of peat. The\r\nland has since sunk, and the peat, in parts 17 ft. thick, is now found\r\nunder Southampton Water, covered by estuarine silt. The Empress Dock\r\nat Southampton was dug where a mud bank was exposed at low water. The\r\nmud bank was formed of river silt 12 to 17 feet thick. Below this was\r\nthe peat, resting on gravel. On the gravel horns of reindeer were\r\nfound. In the peat were large horn cores of the great extinct ox, _Bos\r\nprimigenius_, also horns of red deer, and also in the peat were found\r\nneolithic flint chips, a circular stone hammer head, with a hole bored\r\nthrough for a wooden handle, and a large needle made of horn. Here, at\r\na great interval of time after Palaeolithic man, as we see by the\r\nhistory of the river we have just traced, we come to the new race of\r\nmen, the Neolithic.\r\n\r\nWhen Neolithic man appeared the land stood higher than at present,\r\nthough not so high as during great part of the Pleistocene. Britain\r\nwas divided from the Continent, but the shores were a good way out\r\ninto what is now sea round the coasts, and forests clothed these\r\nfurther shores. Remains of these, known as submerged forest, are found\r\nbelow the tide mark round many parts of our coast. Peat as at\r\nSouthampton Docks, is found under the estuarine mud off Netley. The\r\nwells at the Spithead Forts show an old land surface with peat more\r\nthan 50 feet below the tide level. The old bed of the Solent river\r\nlies much lower still--124 feet below high tide at Noman's Land Fort;\r\nthis channel was probably an estuary after the subsidence of the land\r\ntill it silted up with marine deposits to the level on which the\r\nsubmerged forest grew.\r\n\r\nWhen the Solent and Southampton Water were wooded valleys with rivers\r\nflowing down the middle, the Isle of Wight rivers were tributaries to\r\nthe Solent river, and the forest, as might be expected, extended up\r\ntheir valleys, and covered the low ground of the Island. Under the\r\nalluvial flats are remains of buried forests. In digging a well at\r\nSandford in 1906 large trunks of hard oak were found blocking the\r\nsinking of the well. When the land sank the sea flowed up the river\r\nvalleys, converting them into strait and estuary, and largely filling\r\nup the channels with the silt, which now covers the peat. In the silt\r\nof Newtown river are found bones of _Bos primigenius_, which was found\r\nwith the Neolithic remains in the peat of Southampton docks.\r\n\r\nThe remains of Neolithic man are not only found in submerged forests,\r\nbut over the present surface of the land, or buried in recent\r\ndeposits. He has left us the tombs of his chiefs, known as long\r\nbarrows--great mounds of earth covering a row of chambers made of\r\nflat stones, such as the mounds of New Grange in Ireland, and the\r\ncromlechs or dolmens still standing in Wales and Cornwall. These\r\nconsist of a large flat or curved stone--it may be 14 feet in\r\nlength,--supported on three or four others. Originally a great mound\r\nof earth or stones was piled on top. These have generally been removed\r\nsince by the hand of later man. The stones have been taken for road\r\nmetal, the earth to lay on the land. The great cromlech at Lanyon in\r\nCornwall was uncovered by a farmer, who had removed 100 cart loads of\r\nearth to lay on his stony land before he had any idea that it was not\r\na natural mound. Then he came on the great cromlech underneath.\r\nAnother form of monument was the great standing stone or menhir, one\r\nof which, the Longstone on the Down above Mottistone still stands to\r\nmark the tomb of some chieftain of, it may be, 4,000 years ago.\r\n\r\nThe implements of Neolithic man are found all over England, the smooth\r\npolished axe head, commonly called a celt (Lat. _celtis_, a chisel),\r\nthe chipped arrow head, the flaked flint worked by secondary chipping\r\non the edge into a knife, or a scraper for skins; and much more common\r\nthan the implement, even of the simplest description, are the waste\r\nflakes struck off in the making. Very few stone celts have been found\r\nin the Isle of Wight. The flakes are extremely numerous, and a scraper\r\nor knife may often be found. They are turned up by the plough on the\r\nsurface of the fields, in the earth of which they have been preserved\r\nfrom rubbing and weathering. They have however, acquired a remarkable\r\npolish, or \"patina\"--how is not clearly explained--which distinguishes\r\ntheir surface from the waxy appearance of newly-broken flint. In\r\nplaces the ground is so covered with flakes that we can have no doubt\r\nthat these are the sites of settlements. The implements were made from\r\nthe black flints fresh out of the chalk, and we can locate the\r\nNeolithic flint workings. In our northern range of downs where the\r\nstrata are vertical the layers of flint in the Upper Chalk run out on\r\nthe top of the downs, only covered with a thin surface soil. In\r\nplaces where this soil has been removed--as in digging a quarry--the\r\nchalk is seen to be covered with flakes similar to those found on the\r\nlower ground, save that they are weathered white from lying exposed on\r\nthe hard chalk, instead of on soft soil into which they would\r\ngradually sink by the burrowing of worms. It is probable that these\r\nflakes would be found more or less along the range of downs under the\r\nsurface soil.\r\n\r\nIn places on the Undercliff have been found what are known as Kitchen\r\nMiddens--heaps of shells which have accumulated near the huts of\r\ntribes of coast dwellers, who lived on shellfish. One such was\r\nformerly exposed in the stream below the old church at Bonchurch, and\r\nis believed to extend below the foundations of the Church.\r\n\r\nAfter a long duration of neolithic times a great step in civilisation\r\ntook place with the introduction of bronze. Bronze implements were\r\nintroduced into this country probably some time about B.C. 1800-1500;\r\nand bronze continued to be the best material of manufacture till the\r\nintroduction of iron some two or three centuries before the visit of\r\nJulius Caesar to these Islands. To the early bronze age belong the\r\ngraves of ancient chieftains known as round barrows, of which many are\r\nto be seen on the Island downs. Funeral urns and other remains have\r\nbeen found in these, some of which are now in the museum at\r\nCarisbrooke Castle. Belonging to later times are the remains of the\r\nRoman villa at Brading and smaller remains of villas in other places;\r\nand cemeteries of Anglo-Saxon date, rich in weapons and ornaments,\r\nwhich have been excavated on Chessil and Bowcombe Downs. But the study\r\nof the remains of ancient man forms a science in itself--Archaeology.\r\nIn studying the periods of Palaeolithic and Neolithic man we have stood\r\non the borderland where Geology and Archaeology meet. We have seen that\r\nvast geological changes have taken place since man appeared on earth.\r\nWe must remember that the geological record is still in process of\r\nbeing written. It is not the record of a time sundered from the\r\npresent day, but continuous with our own times; and it is by the study\r\nof processes still in operation that we are able to read the story of\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: Mr. W. Dale, F.S.A.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: See figure 9, p. 79.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: See account by R. W. Poulton in F. Morey's \"Guide\r\n    to the Natural History of the Isle of Wight.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 20: Surv. Mem., I.W., 1921, p. 174.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE SCENERY OF THE ISLAND--Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter studying the various geological formations that enter into the\r\ncomposition of the Isle of Wight, and learning how the Island was\r\nmade, it will be interesting to take a general view of the scenery,\r\nand see how its varied character is due to the nature of its geology.\r\nIt would hardly be possible to find anywhere an area so small as this\r\nlittle Island with such a variety of geological formations. The result\r\nis a remarkable variety in the scenery.\r\n\r\nThe main feature of the Island is the range of chalk downs running\r\neast and west, and terminating in the bold cliffs of white chalk at\r\nFreshwater and the Culvers. Here we have vertical cliffs of great\r\nheight, their white softened to grey by weathering and the soft haze\r\nthrough which they are often seen. In striking contrast of colour are\r\nthe Red Cliff of Lower Greensand adjoining the Culvers, and the\r\nmany-coloured sands of Alum Bay joining on to the chalk of Freshwater.\r\nThe summits of the chalk downs have a characteristic softly rounded\r\nform, and the chalk is covered with close short herbage suited to the\r\nsheep which frequently dot the green surface. Where sheets of flint\r\ngravel cap the downs, as on St. Boniface, they are covered by furze\r\nand heather, producing a charming variation from the smooth turf where\r\nthe surface is chalk. The Lower Greensand forms most of the undulating\r\ncountry between the two ranges of downs; while the Upper Greensand,\r\nthough occupying a smaller area, produces one of the most conspicuous\r\nfeatures of the scenery--the walls of escarpment that form the inland\r\ncliffs between Shanklin and Wroxall, Gat Cliff above Appuldurcombe,\r\nthe fine wall of Gore Cliff above Rocken End, and the line of cliffs\r\nabove the Undercliff. To the Gault Clay is due the formation of the\r\nUndercliff--the terrace of tumbled strata running for miles well above\r\nthe sea, but sheltered by an upper cliff on the north, and in parts\r\novergrown with picturesque woods. The impervious Gault clay throws out\r\nsprings around the downs, which form the headwaters of the various\r\nIsland streams. The upper division of the Lower Greensand, the\r\nSandrock, forms picturesque undulating foothills, often wooded, as at\r\nApsecastle, and at Appuldurcombe and Godshill Park. On a spur of the\r\nSandrock stands Godshill Church, a landmark visible for miles around.\r\nAt Atherfield we have a fine line of cliffs of Lower Greensand, while\r\nthe Wealden Strata on to Brook form lower and softer cliffs.\r\n\r\nTo the north of the central downs the Tertiary sands and clays, often\r\ncovered by Plateau gravel, form an extended slope towards the Solent\r\nshore, much of it well wooded, and presenting a charming landscape\r\nseen from the tops of the downs. This slope of Tertiary strata is\r\ndeeply cut into by streams, which form ravines and picturesque creeks,\r\nas Wootton Creek, 200 feet below the level of the surrounding country.\r\nWhile much of the Island coast is a line of vertical cliff, the\r\nnorthern shores are of gentler aspect, wooded slopes reaching to the\r\nwater's edge, or meadow land sloping gradually to the sea level.\r\nOpposite the mouths of streams are banks of shingle and sand dunes,\r\nforming the spits locally known as \"dovers.\" Some of these, in\r\nparticular, St. Helen's Spit, afford interesting hunting grounds for\r\nthe botanist.\r\n\r\nThe great variety of soil and situation renders the Isle of Wight a\r\nplace of interest to the botanist. We have the plants of chalk downs,\r\nof the sea cliff and shore, of the woods and meadows, of lane and\r\nhedgerow, and of the marshes. The old villages of the Island, often\r\noccupying very picturesque situations--as Godshill on a spur of the\r\nsouthern downs, Newchurch on a bluff overlooking the Yar valley,\r\nShorwell nestling among trees in a south-looking hollow of the downs,\r\nBrighstone with its old church cottages and farmhouses among trees and\r\nmeadows between down and sea--the old and interesting churches, the\r\nthatched cottages, the old manor houses of Elizabethan or Jacobean\r\ndate, now mostly farm houses, for which the Island is famous, add to\r\nthe varied natural beauty.\r\n\r\nOne of the most characteristic features of the southern coasts of the\r\nIsland, should be mentioned, the Chines,--narrow ravines which cut\r\ninland from the coast through the sandstone and clays of the Greensand\r\nand Wealden strata, and along the beds of which small streams flow to\r\nthe sea. Narrow and steep-sided,--the name by which they are called is\r\nakin to _chink_--they are in striking contrast to the more open\r\nvalleys of the streams which flow into the Solent on the north shore\r\nof the Island. The most beautiful is Shanklin Chine. The cliff at the\r\nmouth of the chine, just inside which stands a picturesque fisherman's\r\ncottage with thatched roof, is 100 ft. high; and the chasm runs inland\r\nfor 350 yds., to where a very reduced cascade (for the water thrown\r\nout of the Upper Greensand by the Gault clay is tapped at its source\r\nfor the town supply) falls vertically over a ledge produced by hard\r\nferruginous beds of the Greensand. Above the cascade the ravine runs\r\non, but much shallower, for some 900 yards. The lower ravine has much\r\nbeauty, tall trees rising up the sides, and overshadowing the chasm,\r\nthe banks thickly clothed with large ferns and other verdure. Much\r\nwilder are the chines on the south-west of the Island. The cascade at\r\nBlackgang falls over hard ferruginous beds (to which the beds over\r\nwhich Shanklin cascade falls--though on a smaller scale--probably\r\ncorrespond). The chine above these beds, being hollowed out in the\r\nsoft clays and sands of the Sandrock series, is much more open. Whale\r\nChine is a long winding ravine between steep walls, the stream at the\r\nbottom making its way through blocks of fallen strata.\r\n\r\nThe cause of these chines seems to be the same in all cases. It may be\r\nnoticed that Shanklin and Luccombe chines are cut in the floors of\r\nopen combes,--wide valleys with gently sloping floors; and at each\r\nside of these chines is to be seen the gravel spread over the floor of\r\nthe old valley. It can scarcely be doubted that these combes are the\r\nheads of the valleys of the old streams, which flowed down a gradual\r\nslope till they joined the old branch (or, rather the old main\r\nriver)[21] of the Yar, flowing over land extending far over what is now\r\nSandown Bay. When the sea encroached, and cut into the course of this\r\nold river, and on till it made a section of what had been the left\r\nslope of the valley, the old tributaries of the Yar now fell over a\r\nline of cliff into the sea. They thus gained new erosive power, and\r\ncut back at a much greater rate new and deeper channels; with the\r\nresult that narrow trenches were cut in the floors of the old gently\r\nsloping valleys. The chines on the S.W. coast are to be explained in a\r\nsimilar way. They have been cut back with vertical sides, because the\r\nencroachment of the sea caused the streams to flow over cliffs, and so\r\ngave then power to cut back ravines at so fast a rate that the\r\nweathering down of the sides could not keep pace with it. The\r\nremarkable wind-erosion of these bare south-westerly cliffs by a sort\r\nof sand-blast driven before the gales to which that stretch of coast\r\nis exposed has already been referred to.\r\n\r\nA few words in conclusion to the reader. I have tried to show you\r\nsomething of the interest and wonder of the story written in the\r\nrocks. We have seen something of the world's making, and of the many\r\nand varied forms of life which have succeeded each other on its\r\nsurface. We have had a glimpse of great and deep problems suggested,\r\nwhich are gradually receiving an answer. Geology has the advantage\r\nthat it can be studied by all who take walks in the country, and\r\nespecially by those who visit any part of the sea coast, without the\r\nneed of elaborate and costly scientific instruments and apparatus. Any\r\ncountry walk will suggest problems for solution. I have tried to lead\r\nyou to observe nature accurately, to think for yourselves, to draw\r\nyour own conclusions. I have shown you how to try to solve the\r\nquestions of geology by looking around you at what is taking place\r\nto-day, and by applying this knowledge to explain the records which\r\nhave reached us of what has happened in the past. You are not asked to\r\naccept the facts of the geological story on the word of the writer, or\r\non the authority of others, but to think for yourselves, to learn to\r\nweigh evidence, to seek only to find out the truth, whether it be\r\ngeology you are studying or any other subject, and to follow the truth\r\nwhithersoever it leads.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 21: See p. 91.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF STRATA\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent.

General Memoir of the Isle of Wight,\r\ndate 1889. New edition, entitled \"A short account of the Geology of\r\nthe Isle of Wight,\" by H. J. Osborne White, F.G.S., 1921, price 10s.\r\nThe Memoirs are the great authority for the Geology of the Island:\r\ntechnical; books for Geologists. The New Edition is more condensed\r\nthan the original, but contains much later research. Mantell's\r\n\"Geological Excursions round the Isle of Wight,\" 1847. By one of the\r\ngreat early geologists. Long out of print, but worth getting, if it\r\ncan be picked up second-hand.\r\n\r\nNorman's \"Guide to the Geology of the Isle of Wight,\" 1887, still to\r\nbe obtained of Booksellers in the Island. Gives details of strata,\r\nand lists of fossils, with pencil drawings of fossils.\r\n\r\nOther books bearing on the subject have been mentioned in the text and\r\nfoot-notes.\r\n\r\nAn excellent geological map of the Island, printed in colour, scale\r\n1 in. to the mile, full of geological information, is published by the\r\nSurvey at 3s.\r\n\r\nA good collection of fossils and specimens of rocks from the various\r\nstrata of the Isle of Wight has recently been arranged at the Sandown\r\nFree Library, and should be visited by all interested in the Geology\r\nof the Island. It should prove a most valuable aid to all who take up\r\nthe study, and a great assistance in identifying any specimens they\r\nmay themselves find.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n [Illustration]\r\n GEOLOGICAL MAP OF THE ISLE OF WIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n Words in Italics refer to a page where the meaning of a\r\n term is given.\r\n\r\n\r\n Agates, 22, 41, 50\r\n\r\n Alum Bay, 56-62\r\n\r\n Ammonites, 32, 34, 39, 44\r\n\r\n _Anticline_, 12\r\n\r\n Astronomical Theory of Ice Age, 83, 85\r\n\r\n Atherfeld, 29\r\n\r\n Avon River, 94\r\n\r\n\r\n Barrows, 102, 104\r\n\r\n Barton, 61\r\n\r\n Belemnites, 33\r\n\r\n Bembridge Limestone, 65\r\n   --      shingle at, 95\r\n\r\n Benettites, 27\r\n\r\n \"Blue Slipper,\" 15\r\n\r\n Bonchurch, 50, 103\r\n\r\n Bos primigenius, 101, 102\r\n\r\n Botany, 106\r\n\r\n Bracklesham, 59, 60\r\n\r\n Brading Harbour, 90, 91\r\n\r\n Bronze age, 103\r\n\r\n Brook, 29\r\n\r\n Building Stone, 39, 65\r\n\r\n\r\n Carstone, 26, 35\r\n\r\n Chalcedony, 22, 41, 50\r\n\r\n Chale, 33\r\n\r\n Chalk, divisions of, 45, 51, 52\r\n   --   Marl, 45\r\n   --   Rock, 45\r\n\r\n Chalybeate Springs, 25\r\n\r\n Chert, 39\r\n\r\n Chloritic Marl, 44\r\n\r\n Climate.\r\n\r\n Coal, 8, 61\r\n\r\n Colwell Bay, 64\r\n\r\n Compton Bay, 31, 39\r\n\r\n Conglomerate, modern, 25\r\n\r\n \"Crackers,\" 32\r\n\r\n Cretaceous.\r\n\r\n Crioceras, 34\r\n\r\n Current Bedding, 27\r\n\r\n Cycads.\r\n\r\n\r\n Denudation, 3, 12, 76, 80, 82\r\n\r\n _Dip_, 11\r\n\r\n\r\n Echinoderms, 48, 52\r\n\r\n Eocene, 54\r\n\r\n Erosion, marine, 4\r\n   \"      pre-Tertiary, 54\r\n\r\n _Escarpment_, 14\r\n\r\n\r\n _Faults_, 13\r\n\r\n Fault at Brook, 30\r\n\r\n Flint, origin of, 47\r\n   \"    implements, 97\r\n\r\n Flora, Alum Bay, 59\r\n   \"    Eocene, 58, 62\r\n   \"    Wealden, 18, 27\r\n\r\n Foraminifera, 42, 61\r\n\r\n\r\n Gat Cliff, 38\r\n\r\n Gault, 37\r\n\r\n Glacial Period, 77-85\r\n\r\n Glauconite, 24, 39, 44\r\n\r\n Gore Cliff, 39, 44\r\n\r\n Greensand, Lower, 23-36\r\n    \"       Upper, 37\r\n\r\n Gravels, 50, 79, 89, 93-95\r\n\r\n\r\n Hamstead, 65, 67\r\n\r\n Headon Hill, 62-64\r\n\r\n Hempstead, see Hamstead.\r\n\r\n Hyopotamus, 69\r\n\r\n\r\n Ice Age, 77-85\r\n\r\n Iguanodon, 20\r\n\r\n Insect Limestone, 67\r\n\r\n Iron Ore, 22, 24\r\n\r\n Iron pyrites, 22\r\n\r\n\r\n Landslips, 25, 38\r\n\r\n Limnaea, 63, 64, 66\r\n\r\n Lobsters, Atherfield, 32\r\n\r\n London Clay, 57\r\n\r\n Luccombe, Landslip at, 25\r\n\r\n\r\n Mammalian Remains, 66, 69\r\n\r\n Mammoth, 77, 81\r\n\r\n Marvel, 35\r\n\r\n Medina, 93\r\n\r\n Melbourn Rock, 45\r\n\r\n Miocene, 69, 71, 76\r\n\r\n\r\n Nautilus, 32, 45\r\n\r\n Needles, 4\r\n\r\n Neolithic Man, 100\r\n\r\n Newtown River, 102\r\n\r\n Nummulites, 61\r\n\r\n\r\n Oligocene, 63\r\n\r\n\r\n Palaeolithic Man, 97\r\n\r\n Perna Bed, 23, 31\r\n\r\n Pine Raft, 29\r\n\r\n Planorbis, 63, 64, 66\r\n\r\n Plastic Clay, 57\r\n\r\n Priory Bay, 99\r\n\r\n Purbeck Marble, 16\r\n\r\n\r\n Quarr, 65\r\n\r\n\r\n Rag, 38\r\n\r\n Rock (place), 35\r\n\r\n Roman Villas, 104\r\n\r\n\r\n St. Boniface Down, 50, 100, 105\r\n\r\n St. George's Down, 79, 100\r\n\r\n Sandown Anticline, 11-13, 89\r\n\r\n Sandrock, 25, 35\r\n\r\n Scaphites, 34\r\n\r\n Scenery, 105\r\n\r\n Sea Urchins, 48, 52,\r\n\r\n Shanklin Chine, 107\r\n\r\n Solent, 94\r\n\r\n Southampton Dock, 101\r\n    \"        Water, 94\r\n\r\n Sponges in Flint, 47\r\n\r\n Stone Age, 97\r\n\r\n Strata, Table of, 110, 111\r\n\r\n _Strike_, 11\r\n\r\n Submerged Forest, 101\r\n\r\n Swanage, 93\r\n\r\n _Syncline_, 12\r\n\r\n\r\n Table of Strata, 110, 111\r\n\r\n Tertiary, 54\r\n\r\n Totland Bay, 63, 95\r\n\r\n Tufa, 45\r\n\r\n Turtle, 58, 65, 68\r\n\r\n\r\n Undercliff, formation of, 25, 38\r\n\r\n\r\n Volcanic Action, 5\r\n\r\n\r\n Wealden, 15\r\n\r\n Whitcliff Bay, 56-67\r\n\r\n Wood, Fossil, 8, 15, 18, 27, 29\r\n\r\n\r\n Yar, Eastern, 89-91\r\n   \"  Western, 92\r\n\r\n\r\n Zones of Chalk, 51, 52\r\n\r\n\r\n_Printed by The Crypt House Press, Bell Lane, Gloucester._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the changes noted below, the text in this file\r\nis the same as that in the original printed version.
