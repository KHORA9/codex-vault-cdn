NASHVILLE, TENN., OCTOBER, 1905. NO. 1\r\n\r\nLuther Burbank\r\n\r\n  _He touched the spiculed desert--cacti-cursed--\r\n    And turned its thorns to figs, its thistles, fruit;\r\n  He nodded to the daisy, half immersed\r\n    In dwarfing dust, and lo! a lily mute\r\n    Rose from the weeds--a perfume with a flute._\r\n\r\n  _And flowers ran to meet him--trailing vine--\r\n    And wild hedge-roses--they whose souls had died\r\n  Beneath the feet of cattle and of kine--\r\n    Sought him--those pallid Magdalenes--and cried\r\n    To touch his hem, and so stood glorified._\r\n\r\n  _Trees dwarfed and soulless--fruits with hearts of stone,\r\n    Wedded at his word; and in the sacred tryst\r\n  Of loves united, that had yearned alone,\r\n    Gave to the world the nectar of their bliss\r\n    In pitless peaches, crimsoned with a kiss._\r\n\r\n  _Who plants his poems in a berry’s bed,\r\n    Or writes, with wild roses, sonnets to the sun,\r\n  Hangs pictures on orchard boughs in gold and red,\r\n    Makes epics of fruitland where before were none,\r\n    Is Poet, Painter, Preacher--Master--all in one!_\r\n\r\n  JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBenefits of Forestry to Farmers\r\n\r\n\r\nBY PERCY BROWN, OF EWELL FARM.\r\n\r\nNote.--Mr. Brown is a practical forester, having been chief forester\r\nfor the Houston Oil Co. and a graduate of Biltmore Forest School.--Ed.\r\n\r\n  The preservation of our forests is an imperative business necessity.\r\n  We have come to see that whatever destroys the forest, except to make\r\n  way for agriculture, threatens our well being.--President Roosevelt.\r\n\r\nWith abundant supplies of timber for farm consumption, farmers of the\r\nSouth have been inclined to regard the question of forest preservation\r\nmerely as a matter of sentiment, and have come to look upon the\r\nforester as an impracticable sort of sentimentalist, whose main object\r\nin life is to keep some lumberman from cutting his timber.\r\n\r\nThis indifference has resulted in the loss of the support of the\r\nfarming element to the cause of forestry, whereas the lumberman\r\nwho at one time considered the forester his natural enemy and the\r\nforestry cause a clog in the wheels of progress, immediately began to\r\ninvestigate the question with a view of combatting forest legislation\r\nand the creation of a forestry sentiment throughout the country.\r\n\r\nThe result was that a thorough understanding of the objects of\r\nforestry and the aims of the forester has caused the lumbermen and\r\nlumber associations to give their unqualified support to all practical\r\nforestry legislation. And in the Southern States we find that the only\r\njournal of any importance that is persistently advocating forestry as a\r\nbusiness is one of the foremost lumber journals south of the Ohio River.\r\n\r\nThe silence that the farm journals of the country have maintained on\r\nthe question can be explained only by their ignorance of the question\r\nand its important bearing on the agricultural interests of the entire\r\ncountry. And as it is the purpose of this magazine to discuss all\r\nquestions of vital importance as well as those that will be of passing\r\ninterest to the farmers of the whole country it is well to begin with\r\nan understanding of what forestry is, and to advance a few reasons why\r\nthe farmer should be the most ardent advocate of forestry.\r\n\r\nDr. W. H. Schlich, the noted English forester, says the task with which\r\n“forestry has to deal is to ascertain the principles according to which\r\nforests shall be managed and to apply these principles to the treatment\r\nof the forests.”\r\n\r\nDr. B. E. Fernow, formerly chief of the Division of Forestry, defines\r\nit as “The rational treatment of forests for forest purposes.”\r\n\r\nDr. C. A. Schenck, of the Biltmore Forest School, gives the following\r\nvery broad and terse definition: “Forestry is the proper handling of\r\nforest investments.”\r\n\r\nWe see from these definitions that the forestry is purely a matter of\r\nbusiness differing only from other investments in the time element. A\r\nforestry venture cannot be undertaken with a view of getting immediate\r\nreturns, but contemplates the continuity of the investment which makes\r\nit the first duty of the forester to determine what is the best use the\r\nforest can be put to in order to obtain the greatest annual return upon\r\nthe investment without drawing upon his capital invested. This does\r\nnot necessarily mean that his forest must be devoted entirely to the\r\nproduction of timber, it may be maintained as a game preserve, or as a\r\nwatershed, in which case the returns to be obtained from the sale of\r\ntimber will be a secondary consideration.\r\n\r\nConsequently we see that the forester is not merely a botanist or a\r\ntree planter, but in the fullest sense of the term is a technically\r\neducated man, with the knowledge of the forest trees and their history\r\nand of all that pertains to their production, combines further\r\nknowledge which enables him to manage forest property so as to produce\r\ncertain conditions resulting in the highest attainable revenue from the\r\nsoil by wood-crops.\r\n\r\nThe effect of forest cover and water-flow has been so persistently and\r\nconstantly proclaimed as the one great need for forest preservation\r\nthat the more important one of supply has been neglected.\r\n\r\nIn a series of articles by Dr. Fernow, on “The Outlook of the Timber\r\nSupply in the United States” (Quarterly, 1903), after carefully\r\nconsidering the data compiled by the Chief Geographer, together with\r\nhis personal investigations, he summarizes the situation, which\r\njustifies the urgent need of the forester’s art in the United States,\r\nfrom the point of view of supplies, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The consumption of forest supplies, larger than in any other country\r\nin the world, promises not only to increase with the natural increase\r\nof the population, but in excess of this increase per capita, similar\r\nto that of other civilized, industrial nations, annually by a rate of\r\nnot less than three to five per cent.\r\n\r\n2. The most sanguine estimate of timber standing predicates an\r\nexhaustion of supplies in less than thirty years if this rate of\r\nconsumption continues, and of the most important timber supplies in a\r\nmuch shorter time.\r\n\r\n3. The conditions for continued imports from our neighbor, Canada,\r\npractically the only country having accessible supplies such as we\r\nneed, are not reassuring and may not be expected to lengthen natural\r\nsupplies appreciably.\r\n\r\n4. The reproduction of new supplies on the existing forest area could,\r\nunder proper management, be made to supply the legitimate requirements\r\nfor a long time; but fires destroy the young growth over large areas,\r\nand where production is allowed to develop in the mixed forest, at\r\nleast, owing to the culling processes, which remove the valuable kinds\r\nand leave the weeds, these latter reproduce in preference.\r\n\r\n5. The attempts at systematic silviculture, that is, the growing of new\r\ncrops, are, so far, infinitesimal compared with the needs.\r\n\r\nThat this is a question of serious importance to the South, as well as\r\nto the whole country, is shown by the great increase in the South’s\r\nproduction of lumber, which, owing to the depletion in other sections\r\nof the country, has risen from eleven and nine-tenths per cent in\r\n1880 to twenty-five and two-tenths per cent of the total output of the\r\nUnited States in 1900, and it is not hard to predict an even greater\r\nproduction for 1910, when one concern alone has increased the number\r\nof its mills in the long leaf pine belt from seven to fifteen, and its\r\ndaily output from 500,000 to 1,000,000 feet during the period from 1900\r\nto 1904.\r\n\r\nBasing their estimates upon the present standards of grading, the\r\nhardwood lumber journals are predicting the total exhaustion of the\r\navailable supplies of this timber in fifteen years, and the hardwood\r\nlumbermen are already looking to forestry as a means of relief.\r\n\r\nIn an address delivered before the third annual meeting of the Hardwood\r\nManufacturers’ Association of the United States, as an introduction to\r\nthe subject of “The Hardwood Producing Centers of the United States,”\r\nMr. John W. Love, of Nashville, said:\r\n\r\n  “I hope to be able to briefly call the attention of this body of\r\n  practical manufacturers to a few pertinent facts that may, in a\r\n  measure, at least, open our eyes to a painful truth, viz., the\r\n  rapidly decreasing area of hardwood timber in the United States,\r\n  and when we consider how very little is being done to conserve our\r\n  forest growth--how the forests are being cleaned from hoop-poles to\r\n  giant oaks, and that to supply the one item of cross ties that are\r\n  used in this country alone, about 4,000,000,000 feet of timber is\r\n  required (clearing about 200,000 acres of wood lot annually), and\r\n  a large proportion of these ties are cut from thrifty young trees,\r\n  we must conclude that a matter so weighty as to give us pause. The\r\n  one hopeful sign of the future is the hope that practical forestry\r\n  methods may be enforced by the Government.”\r\n\r\nThis in an address from a lumberman to an association of lumber\r\nmanufacturers is indeed an encouraging sign of the times, but I fear\r\nhe has waked up “to the realization that our efforts to secure a more\r\nrational treatment of our forest resources and apply forestry in their\r\nmanagement are not too early, but rather too late: that they are by no\r\nmeans sufficient; that serious trouble and inconvenience are in store\r\nfor us in the not too distant future; that the blind indifference and\r\nthe dallying or amateurish playing with the problem of legislatures and\r\nofficials is fatal.”\r\n\r\nThe railroads and the farmers of the Western plains were among the\r\nfirst to appreciate the importance of making provision for a future\r\nsupply of construction timber and material for use on the farms.\r\n\r\nWith the far-sighted policy of manipulators of great corporations, the\r\nofficials of the Santa Fe Railroad were among the pioneers in forest\r\nplanting in America on railroads, as about twenty years ago they\r\nplanted 1,280 acres in hardy catalpa at a total expense of $128,000,\r\nand they estimated that at the end of twenty-five years from date of\r\nplanting this tract will have produced $2,500,000 of poles, ties and\r\nposts.\r\n\r\nA few years ago the Illinois Central made a plantation of catalpa and\r\nblack locust in Illinois and during the current year the Louisville &\r\nNashville Railroad have arranged for a similar plantation in Alabama.\r\n\r\nIt has not been necessary for the farmers of the South to resort to\r\nplantations for their supplies of posts and fuel, and if we are not\r\nimprovident of our supplies it will hardly become necessary, as we have\r\nleft on nearly every farm enough timber of suitable varieties from\r\nwhich we can procure our future supplies by self-sown seed, provided\r\nthe sections to be reserved for timber growth are protected from stock\r\nand fires. In some instances, however, it may prove cheaper and more\r\nexpedient to plant as was the case with the now famous yaggy catalpa\r\nplantation near Hutchinson, Kan., in which a ten-year-old block showed\r\na net value of $197, or a yearly net income of $19.75 per acre.\r\n\r\nAnd a twenty-five-year-old plantation of red juniper, belonging to F.\r\nC. F. Schutz, Menlo, Iowa, showed a net value of $200.54 per acre, or a\r\nyearly net income of about $8--not a bad showing for forestry, when we\r\nbear in mind that the net income from other farm crops seldom exceeds\r\nthat amount, but from the farm crops the returns are secured annually,\r\nwhile in the case of a forestry investment there is quite a period\r\npreceding the first harvest, during which we have to figure in an\r\naccumulative value.\r\n\r\nAll wood-lot planting should be governed by the local demand, for\r\nthat reason it would be hard to suggest either methods or species for\r\nthe South as a whole, but generally speaking, black locust (robinia\r\npseudoacacia), hardy catalpa, mulberry and chestnut would be the most\r\ndesirable, as the first three would be quickly available for fence\r\nposts, and the chestnut would always be in demand for telephone and\r\ntelegraph poles as well as furnishing construction timber.\r\n\r\nWood-lot forestry has the advantage over similar work conducted on\r\na large scale, as the farmer is at no expense for protection or\r\nsupervision, the location of forest on the farm assures its safety from\r\nfire or trespass, and he gives it his personal attention.\r\n\r\nHowever, to secure the most desirable management his supervision should\r\nbe carried on under the direction of trained foresters.\r\n\r\nTo secure this without appreciable additional cost it is to his\r\ninterest to ally himself with those who are striving for a State\r\nforestry system, under which a forester would be employed whose duty\r\nwould be to look after the State reserves and give advice to farmers\r\nand timber land owners on the management of all forest tracts set aside\r\nfor permanent forest investments.\r\n\r\nThe indirect utility of the forests is well known and appreciated by\r\nthose who have given the matter any thought, but the average American\r\nfarmer has little use for a thing which does not appeal to him in\r\ndollars and cents, however, the Bureau of Forestry realizing the great\r\nimportance of this matter to the agricultural interests, sent Mr. J.\r\nW. Twomey to the San Bernardino Mountains of California to conduct\r\ninvestigations of the “Relation of Forests to Stream Flow,” and in the\r\n“Year-Book” of the Department of Agriculture for 1904 he reports these\r\nconclusions:\r\n\r\n“In humid regions, where the precipitation is fairly evenly distributed\r\nover the year, and where the catchment area is sufficiently large to\r\npermit the greater part of the seepage to enter the stream above the\r\npoint where it is gauged, the evidence accumulated to date indicates\r\nthat stream flow is materially increased by the presence of forests.\r\n\r\n“In regions characterized by the short wet season and a long dry one,\r\nas in Southern California and many other portions of the West, present\r\nevidence indicates, at least on small mountainous catchment areas, that\r\nthe forest very materially decreases the total amount of run-off.\r\n\r\n“Although the forest may have, on the whole, but little appreciable\r\neffect in increasing the rainfall and the annual run-off, its economic\r\nimportance in regulating streams is beyond computation. The great\r\nindirect value of the forest is the effect which it has in preventing\r\nwind and water erosion, thus allowing the soil on hills and mountains\r\nto remain where it is formed, and in other ways providing an adequate\r\nabsorbing medium at the sources of the water courses of the country.\r\nIt is the amount of water that passes into the soil, not the amount of\r\nrainfall, that makes a garden or a desert.”\r\n\r\nWith such evidence as this before them, what farmer in the South will\r\ndare question the importance of forestry to the agricultural interests\r\nof every section of the South, and especially those sections lying\r\nadjacent to streams having their sources in the territory of the\r\nproposed Appalachian Forest Reserve?\r\n\r\nBy protecting the forest growth on the watersheds of these streams the\r\nflow of the water is rendered more continuous, and the dangers from\r\nviolent floods, which destroy fences and carry away the most fertile\r\nsoil, are lessened.\r\n\r\nThe South to-day is pre-eminent in agriculture and timber production,\r\nbut the wasteful destruction of our forest resources bids fair to\r\ntransfer the laurels to the great undeveloped West, where we find\r\nover 60,000,000 acres of forest reserves, which will for all time to\r\ncome offer a continuous supply of lumber for the manufacturer and\r\nan abundance of water for the farmers who have made a garden of the\r\ndeserts.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of the Southern farmer to join with the hardwood\r\nlumberman in his efforts to introduce forestry in the South, and by so\r\ndoing give to succeeding generations the heritage that except for the\r\ndestructive forces of man would have come to them in nature’s great\r\nscheme of things.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO THE CAHABA RIVER\r\n\r\n  Ay, laugh along, thou cypress-crown’d stream,\r\n    Thou echo of the cloud’s kiss on the hills,\r\n  A Southern maid with eyes of deep-pool gleam\r\n    And cheeks of dimpled whorls and smiles of rills.\r\n\r\n  Dance, sweet, on sward of violet-crested green,\r\n    Marked with the silvery pathway of thy track--\r\n  With blue embossing ridge of hills between\r\n    And hair mist in the soft wind floating back.\r\n\r\n  And sweet with soul of aromatic leaves,\r\n    Steeped in thy crucible of sun-warmed pool,\r\n  And with the warm breath of the bay, that grieves\r\n    His love-sigh out amid thy shadows cool.\r\n\r\n  Dance, sweet, adown thy pathway’s wooded hush,\r\n    Laughing to ’scape the red arms of the hills,\r\n  Yet bringing on thy cheek the telltale blush,\r\n    For chattering tongues of all the old dame mills.\r\n\r\n  The live-oak bends to kiss thee, and his sigh\r\n    Is mingled with the passing of thy charms;\r\n  The willows start from hidden coverts by\r\n    To clasp thee in their looping, lover arms.\r\n\r\n  Is that deep shadow dark’ning now thine eye\r\n    Repentant sorrow for the willow’s plight,\r\n  As though the stern gloom of the cypress nigh\r\n    Thou speedest like a Naiad of the night?\r\n\r\n  O life--life--life--and hast thou found it so,\r\n    A journey now in sunlight, now in shade--\r\n  A laughter from the willows bending low\r\n    A gloom-sob which the cypresses have made?\r\n\r\n  JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle Sister\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle Sister was Col. Rutherford’s only grandchild. She was also\r\nCapt. John Rutherford’s only niece. I mention the last-named gentleman\r\nbecause he had a great deal to do with the making of this story. He was\r\nquite original himself, and a braver, bigger-hearted friend no man ever\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nThe Rutherford home was in the Middle Basin of Tennessee. The house\r\nwas built in 1812 by John Rutherford the first, who had eaten, slept,\r\nfought, and finally died, with his old friend, Andrew Jackson. No\r\ntruer, better, braver people than the Rutherfords lived. No black sheep\r\never came out of the flock. I have always maintained that a family’s\r\nability to refrain from throwing scrubs is the truest test of its\r\npurity. The prepotency that produced dead-game, honest and true men and\r\nwomen every time, is a long way ahead of “Norman blood.” “That’s the\r\ngenuine stuff,” as little three-year-old Sister once naively remarked\r\nafter looking over Uncle John’s pacing filly. However, that’s a story I\r\nwill tell later.\r\n\r\nWhen I first knew Little Sister she was only two years old, for just\r\ntwo years before a terrible gloom had settled over the Rutherford home\r\nwhen Little Sister’s mother, the Colonel’s daughter, had died. Death\r\nis a terrible, bitter, hollow mockery to those who live. Some day, in\r\nanother world, we shall see things differently. In this, “cabined,\r\ncribbed, confined” in our puny environments, we see only “through a\r\nglass darkly,” and so God help us.\r\n\r\nAs I said, she was the old Colonel’s only daughter--the fairest,\r\nfrailest, most lovely and most intellectual--a bride one year, and we\r\nburied her the next. That’s all, except Little Sister, a fair, frail,\r\nhot-tempered, sensitive--all brain and nerve--little tot who came to\r\ntake her mother’s place. Her bright blue eyes, pale-pink face and\r\nred-flaxen hair kept one thinking of perpetual sunsets and twilights.\r\nShe was a _fac simile_ of her mother--intellect, impulsiveness,\r\nloveliness, all except one thing--temper. She was fire and powder\r\nthere. A flash, an explosion--then she was sobbing for forgiveness in\r\nyour arms. That was Little Sister.\r\n\r\n“I can’t see where in the world she gets her temper from,” Grandmother\r\nRutherford said when two-year-old Little Sister slapped her squarely in\r\nthe face one day and then hung sobbing around the old lady’s neck as if\r\nthe blow had broken her own heart.\r\n\r\n“Col. Rutherford,” she would add impressively, “this child ought to be\r\nspanked till she is conquered.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t do it, mother,” said Uncle John, while Little Sister gave him\r\na grateful look through her tears; “don’t do it; that is not the way\r\nto train race colts. A conquering, your way, would spoil her. She will\r\nneed all of that temper, if it is brought under control, to get through\r\nlife with, and land anywhere near the wire first. Besides, with her\r\nsensitiveness, don’t you see she is suffering now more than if we had\r\npunished her? If she were a plug, now, she would slap you and never\r\nbe sorry till you made her sorry with a switch. But conscience beats\r\nhickory, and gentleness is away ahead of blows.”\r\n\r\nAnd Uncle John would catch the two-year-old up and take her out to\r\nsee the colts. At sight of these she would forget all other trouble.\r\nHer love for horses was as deep in her as the Rutherford blood. When\r\nshe saw the colts it was comical to see the great burst of sunshiny\r\nlaughter that spread all over her conscience-stricken face, while two\r\nbig tears--such big ones as only little heart-broken two-year-olds can\r\noriginate--were rolling slowly down her nose.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Uncle John,” she would say gleefully, “now, ain’t they just too\r\nsweet for anything? Do let me get down and hug them, every one.” And\r\nUncle John would let her if he had to catch every one himself.\r\n\r\nThe clear-cut way she talked English reminds me that there were two\r\nthings about Little Sister that always astonished me--her intellect and\r\nher great sense of motherhood. I could readily see how she inherited\r\nthe first, but could never understand how so tiny a thing had such a\r\ngreat big mother-heart. She loved everything little--everything born on\r\nthe farm. The fact that anything in hair, hide or feathers had arrived\r\nwas an occasion of jollification to her.\r\n\r\n“Oh, do let me see the dear little thing,” would be the first thing\r\nfrom Little Sister that greeted the announcement. And she generally\r\nsaw it; at least, if Uncle John was around. It is scarcely necessary\r\nto add that during the spring of the year, on a farm as large as\r\nthe Rutherford place, she was kept in one continual state of happy\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nOne day they missed her from the house, and Uncle John quickly\r\n“tracked” her to the cow barn, for it occurred to him he had only\r\nthe day before shown her the Short-horn’s latest edition--a big,\r\ndouble-jointed, ugly, hungry male calf, who slept all day in the bedded\r\nstall like a young Hercules, and only waked up long enough to wrinkle\r\nhis huge nose around and mentally make the remark the Governor of\r\nNorth Carolina is said to have made to the Governor of South Carolina.\r\nBut Little Sister had declared he was “perfectly lovely.” That is\r\nwhere Uncle John found her. She had climbed over the high stall gate,\r\nunaided, and, after becoming acquainted, she had given young Hercules,\r\nas a propitiary offering, her own beautiful string of beads and placed\r\nthem around his tawny neck.\r\n\r\n“Come out of there, you little rascal,” laughed Uncle John. “What do\r\nyou see pretty about that big, ugly calf?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Uncle John,” sighed Little Sister, “I’m so sorry for him--he isn’t\r\npretty, to be sure--and so I have given him my beads. But he has a\r\nlovely curly head,” she added encouragingly, “and he seems to be such a\r\nhealthy child.”\r\n\r\nOn another occasion they missed Little Sister about night. Everybody\r\nstarted out in alarm. Grandma found her first, coming from the\r\nbrood-sow’s lot.\r\n\r\n“Where in the world have you been, darling?” asked Grandma, as she\r\npicked her up.\r\n\r\n“Playing with the little yesterday pigs,” she said. “And, Grandma, I\r\nought to have come home sooner, but I kissed one of the cunningest of\r\nthe little pigs good-night, and all the others looked so hurt, and\r\nsquealed so because I didn’t kiss them, too, I just had to catch every\r\none of them and kiss them before they would go to sleep. Indeed, I did.”\r\n\r\nInheritance had played a Hamlet’s part in Little Sister’s make-up.\r\nMost children crow, and babble, and lisp, and talk in divers and\r\ndifferent languages before they learn to talk English, while some never\r\nlearn at all. But not so with Little Sister. The first word she ever\r\nattempted was perfectly pronounced. The first sentence she put together\r\nwas grammatically correct. The correctness of her language, for one\r\nso small, made it sound so quaint that I often had to laugh at its\r\nquaintness, while her deep earnestness and intensity but added to its\r\noriginality.\r\n\r\nAnd she picked up so many things from Uncle John. Else where did she\r\nget this: Pete was a little darkey on the farm whose chief business\r\nwas to entertain Little Sister when everything else failed. Pete’s\r\nrepertoire consisted of all the funny things a monkey ever did, but his\r\ntwo star performances were “racking” like Deacon Jones’ old claybank\r\npacer, and “playin’ possum.” Little Sister never tired of having\r\nPete do these two. And it was comical. Everybody knew Deacon Jones,\r\nwith his angular, sedate, solemn way of riding, and the unearthly,\r\ndouble-shuffling, twisting, cork-screw gait of his old pacer. The\r\nludicrous gait of the old pacer struck Pete early in life, and he soon\r\nlearned to get down on his all-fours and make Deacon Jones’ old horse\r\nashamed of himself any day. The imitation was so perfect that Uncle\r\nJohn used to call in his friends to see the show, which consisted of\r\nPete doing the racking act, while Little Sister, astraddle of his back,\r\nwith one hand in his shirt collar and the other wielding a hickory\r\nswitch, played the Deacon. One evening, as the company was taking\r\nin the performance, and Pete, now thoroughly leg-weary, had paced\r\naround for the twentieth time, Little Sister was seen to whack him in\r\nthe flanks very vigorously and exclaim: “Come, pace along there, you\r\nson-of-a-gun, or I’ll put a head on you!”\r\n\r\nUncle John nearly fell out of his chair. Only a week before he had made\r\nthat same remark to Pete for being a little slow about bringing in his\r\nshaving water. But he didn’t know that Little Sister had heard him.\r\n\r\nThe spring Little Sister was three years old the Colonel came in\r\nto breakfast one morning with a cloud on his brow. It was a great\r\ndisappointment to him--old Betty, his saddle mare, the mare he had\r\nridden for fifteen years, “the best bred mare in Tennessee,” had\r\nbrought into the world a most unpromising offspring. “It is weak, puny\r\nand no ’count, John,” he said to his son; “deformed, or something, in\r\nits front legs, knuckles over and can’t stand up, the most infernally\r\ncurby-legged thing I ever saw.”\r\n\r\n“That’s too bad,” remarked Uncle John, as he helped himself to another\r\nbattercake. “I’ll go out after breakfast and look at the poor little\r\nthing.”\r\n\r\n“No use,” remarked the Colonel gravely, “it’s deformed--can’t stand up;\r\nand out of compassion for it I’ve ordered Jim to knock it in the head.\r\nIt’ll be better dead than alive.”\r\n\r\nLittle Sister, with her big, inquisitive eyes, had been taking it all\r\nin, as she gravely ate her oatmeal and cream. But the last remark of\r\nGrandpa stopped the spoon half way to her mouth. The next instant,\r\nunobserved, she had slipped out of her high-chair and flown to the barn.\r\n\r\n“I tell you, John,” remarked the old Colonel, “I sometimes think this\r\nbreeding horses is pure lottery. To think of old Betty, the gamest,\r\nspeediest mare I ever rode, having such a colt as that; and by Brown\r\nHal, too--the best young pacing horse I ever saw. It makes me feel bad\r\nto think of it. Now, take old Betty’s pedigree----”\r\n\r\nBut the old Colonel never got any further, for piercing screams from\r\nLittle Sister came from the barn. Uncle John glanced at her empty\r\nchair, turned pale with fright, kicked over the two chairs which stood\r\nin his way, then his favorite setter dog that blockaded the door,\r\nand rushed hatless to the barn. There a pathetic sight met his eyes.\r\nA negro stood in old Betty’s stall door with an axe in his hand. In\r\na far corner, on some straw, lay a sorry-looking, helpless colt. But\r\nit was not alone, for a three-year-old tot knelt beside it, and held\r\nthe colt’s head in her lap while she shook her tiny fist at the black\r\nexecutioner, and screamed with grief and anger:\r\n\r\n“You shan’t kill this baby colt--you shan’t--you shan’t! Don’t you come\r\nin here--don’t you come! How dare you?” And, child though she was, the\r\nflash of her keen, blue Rutherford eyes, like the bright sights of the\r\nmuzzle of two derringers, had awed the negro in the doorway and stopped\r\nhim in hesitancy and confusion.\r\n\r\n“Go away, Jim,” said Uncle John, as he took in the situation. “Come,\r\nLittle Sister,” he said, “let’s go back to Grandma.”\r\n\r\nBut for once in her life Uncle John had no influence over the little\r\ngirl. She was indignant, shocked, grieved. She fairly blazed through\r\nher tears and sobs. She would never speak to Grandpa again as long as\r\nshe lived. She intended her very self to kill Jim just as soon as she\r\n“got big enough,” and as for Uncle John, she would never even love him\r\nagain if he did not promise her the baby colt should not be killed.\r\n\r\n“Poor little thing,” she said, as she put her arm around its neck and\r\nher tears fell over its big, soft eyes; “God just sent you last night,\r\nand they want to kill you to-day.”\r\n\r\nUncle John brushed a tear away himself, and stooped over and\r\ncritically examined the little filly--for such it was. Little Sister\r\nwatched him intently for, in her opinion Uncle John knew everything and\r\ncould do anything. The tears were still rolling down her cheeks, as\r\nUncle John looked up quickly and said in his boyish, jolly way: “Hello,\r\nLittle Sister, this little filly is all right! Deformed be hanged!\r\nShe’s as sound as a hound’s tooth--just weak in her front tendons. I’ll\r\nsoon fix that. No sir, they don’t kill her, Mousey”--Uncle John called\r\nher Mousey when he wanted her to laugh.\r\n\r\nThe tears gave way to a crackling little laugh. “Well, ain’t that just\r\ntoo sweet for anything; and Oh, Uncle John, ain’t she just sweet enough\r\nto eat?” And Little Sister danced about, the happiest child in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAnd what fun it was to help Uncle John “fix her up,” as he called it.\r\nShe brought him the cotton-batting herself and watched him gravely as\r\nhe made stays for the weak forelegs, and straightened out the crooked\r\nlittle ankles. Finally, when he called Jim, and made him take the\r\nlittle filly up in his arms and carry her into another stall where old\r\nBetty stood and held her up to get her first breakfast, the little\r\ngirl could hardly contain herself. In a burst of generosity she begged\r\nJim’s pardon, and told her Uncle John confidentially that she didn’t\r\nintend to kill Jim at all, now; but was going to give him a pair of her\r\nGrandpa’s old boots instead.\r\n\r\nIn return for this, Jim promptly named the filly “Little Sister,” a\r\ncompliment which tickled the original Little Sister very much.\r\n\r\nBut having said the little filly was no-’count, the old Colonel stuck\r\nto it--refused to notice it or take any stock in it.\r\n\r\n“Po’ little thing,” he would say a month after it was able to pace\r\naround without help from its stays--“po’ little thing; what a pity they\r\ndidn’t kill it!”\r\n\r\nBut Uncle John and Little Sister nursed it, petted it, and helped old\r\nBetty raise it; and the next spring they were rewarded by seeing it\r\ndevelop into a delicate-looking, but exceedingly blood-like, nervous,\r\nhighstrung little miss. Grandpa would surely relent now, but not so.\r\nPrejudice, next to ignorance, is our greatest enemy, and the old\r\nColonel looked at the yearling and remarked:\r\n\r\n“Po’ little thing--that old Betty should have played off on me like\r\nthat!” And he turned indifferently on his heel and walked away,\r\nwhereupon both the filly and the little girl turned up their noses\r\nbehind the old man’s back.\r\n\r\nIn the fall that the little filly was three years old the county pacing\r\nstakes came off. A thousand dollars were hung up at the end of that\r\nrace, but greater still, the county’s reputation was at the feet of the\r\nconqueror. The old Colonel had entered a big pacing fellow in the race,\r\nnamed Princewood, and it looked like nothing could beat him. The big\r\nfellow had been carefully trained for two seasons by a local driver,\r\nand had already cost his owner more than he was worth. “But it’s the\r\nreputation I am after, sir,” the Colonel would say to the driver--“the\r\nhonor of the thing. My farm has already taken it twice; I want to take\r\nit again.”\r\n\r\nNow, Uncle John was quite a whip himself, and the old Colonel had\r\nfailed to notice how all the fall he had been giving Betty’s filly\r\nextra attention, with a hot brush on the road now and then. The old\r\nman, wrapped up as he was in Princewood’s wonderful speed, had even\r\nfailed to notice that Uncle John had frequently called for his light\r\nroad wagon, and he and Little Sister, now six years old, had taken\r\ndelightful spins down the shady places in the by-ways, where nobody\r\ncould see them, behind the high-strung little filly, and that often, at\r\nsupper, when Grandpa would begin to brag about Princewood’s wonderful\r\nspeed, Uncle John would wink at Little Sister, and that little miss\r\nwould have to cram her mouth full of peach preserves to keep from\r\nlaughing out at the table and being sent supperless to bed.\r\n\r\nThere was a big crowd on the day of the race--it looked like all the\r\ncounty was there. The field was a large one, for the purse was rich\r\nand the honor richer--“and Princewood is a prime favorite,” chuckled\r\nthe old Colonel, as he stood holding a little girl’s hand near the\r\ngrandstand.\r\n\r\nBut the little girl was very quiet. For once in her life “the cat had\r\nher tongue.” Now, anybody half educated in child ways would have seen\r\nthis tot clearly expected something to happen. If the old Colonel\r\nhadn’t been so busy talking about Princewood he might have seen it, too.\r\n\r\nThe bell had already rung twice, and all the drivers and horses were\r\nthought to be in, and were preparing to score down, when a newcomer\r\narrived, who attracted a good deal of attention. Instead of a sulky, he\r\nsat in a spider-framed, four-wheeled gentleman’s road cart, at least\r\nfour seconds slow for a race like that. Instead of a cap he wore a soft\r\nfelt hat, and in lieu of a jacket, a cutaway business suit. He nodded\r\nfamiliarly to the starting judge and paced his nervous-looking little\r\nfilly up the stretch.\r\n\r\n“Who is that coming into this race in that kind of a thing?” asked the\r\nold Colonel of a farmer near by--for the old man’s eyesight was failing\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Why, Colonel, don’t you know your own son? That’s Cap’n John\r\nRutherford,” said the farmer.\r\n\r\n“The devil you say!” shouted the excitable old gentleman. “Why, damn\r\nit, has John gone crazy?” and he jumped over a bench and rushed\r\nexcitedly up the stretch to head off the driver of the little filly.\r\n\r\n“In the name of heaven, John,” he shouted, “are you really going to\r\ndrive in this race?”\r\n\r\nCaptain John nodded and smiled.\r\n\r\n“And what’s that po’ little thing you’ve got there?”\r\n\r\n“It’s Little Sister, father,” said Captain John good naturedly. “I’m\r\njust driving her to please the little girl. I want to see how she’ll\r\nact in company, anyway.”\r\n\r\nThe old Colonel was thunderstruck. “Why, you’re a fool,” he blurted\r\nout. “They’ll lose you both in this race. For heaven’s sake, John, get\r\noff the track and don’t disgrace old Betty and the farm this way. Po’\r\nlittle no-’count thing,” he added, sympathetically, “it’ll kill ’er to\r\ngo round there once!”\r\n\r\nThe Captain laughed. “It’s just for a little fun, father--all to please\r\nthe baby. It’s her pet, you know. I’ll just trail them the first heat,\r\nand if she’s too soft I’ll pull out. But she’s better than you think,”\r\nhe added indifferently. “I’ve been driving her a good bit of late.”\r\n\r\nThe old Colonel expostulated--he even threatened--but Captain John\r\nonly laughed and drove off. Then the old Colonel repented, and it was\r\ncomically pathetic to hear him call out in his earnest way: “John! Oh,\r\nJohn! Don’t tell anybody it’s old Betty’s colt, will you?”\r\n\r\nCaptain John laughed. “I’ll bet ten to one,” he chuckled to himself,\r\n“he’ll be telling it before I do.”\r\n\r\nAnd the little filly--when she got into company she seemed to be\r\npositively gay. She forgot all about herself, threw off all her nervous\r\nways, and went away with a rush that almost took Captain John’s breath.\r\nHe pulled her quickly back. “Ho, ho! little miss,” he said, “if you\r\ndo that again you’ll give us dead away,” and he looked slyly around\r\nto see if anybody had seen it. But they were all too busy chasing\r\nPrincewood. That horse clearly had the speed of the crowd. And so Uncle\r\nJohn trailed behind, the very last of the long procession, with the\r\nlittle filly fighting for her head all the way. Nobody seemed to notice\r\nthem at all--nobody but a little girl, who clung to her grandpa’s\r\nmiddle finger and wondered, in her childish faith, if the mighty Uncle\r\nJohn--the Uncle John who knew everything and could do everything, and\r\nwho never missed his mark in all his life, was going, really going, to\r\ntumble now from his lofty throne in her childish mind? And with him\r\nLittle Sister, too.\r\n\r\nShe got behind Grandpa. Princewood paced in way ahead. She stuck her\r\nfingers in her ears so she couldn’t hear the shouts, but took them out\r\nin time to hear Grandpa say, “Well, I thought John had more sense,” as\r\nthat gentleman, after satisfying himself that he was not distanced,\r\npaced slowly in.\r\n\r\nThis made Little Sister think it was all up with Uncle John. She went\r\nafter a glass of lemonade, but really to cry in the dark hall behind\r\nthe grandstand and wipe her eyes on the frills of the pretty little\r\npetticoat Grandma had made her just to wear to the fair. It was too bad.\r\n\r\nWhen she got back Grandpa was gone. He was over in the cooling stable,\r\ntalking to Uncle John.\r\n\r\n“John,” he said solemnly, “don’t disgrace old Betty any more. I’m\r\ndownright sorry for the po’ little thing. I’m afraid she’ll fall dead\r\nin her tracks,” he added.\r\n\r\nCaptain John flushed, “Well, let her drop,” he said, “but if I’m not\r\nmistaken you’ll hear something drop yourself.”\r\n\r\nThe old Colonel turned on his heels in disgust.\r\n\r\nBut Uncle John meant business this time. He changed his cart for a\r\nsulky, and again they got the word. Gradually, carefully, he gave the\r\nlittle filly her head. Steadily, gracefully, she went by them one by\r\none, until at the half she was just behind Princewood, who seemed to\r\nbe claiming all the grandstand’s attention. The field left behind! If\r\nPrincewood wins this heat the race is over!\r\n\r\n“Princewood’s got ’em, Colonel!” exclaimed a countryman to the old man.\r\n“They’s nothin’ that kin head ’im!” and “Princewood wins! Princewood\r\nwins!” as they headed into the stretch.\r\n\r\nAnd then something dropped. Little Sister felt the reins relax, and a\r\nkindly chirrup came from Uncle John. In a twinkling she was up with the\r\nbig fellow, half frightened at her own speed, half doubting, like a\r\nprima donna when her sweet voice first fills a great hall, that it was\r\nreally she who had done it.\r\n\r\n“Princewood! Princewood!” shouted the crowd around their idol, the\r\nColonel. “Princewood will break the record!” from partisans who knew\r\nmore about plow horses than race horses.\r\n\r\nThe old Colonel arose in happy anticipation--and then, as his trained\r\neye really took in the situation, his jaw dropped. What was that little\r\nbay streak that had collared so gamely his big horse? Who was the\r\nquiet-looking gentleman in the soft felt hat, handling the reins like a\r\nveteran driver? His son John was in a cart--this driver was in a sulky.\r\n“Who the devil--” he started to say, when somebody clinging to his\r\nfinger cried out: “Look! Look! Grandpa! It’s Little Sister. Ain’t she\r\njust too sweet for anything?”\r\n\r\nAnd the next instant the little filly laughed in the big pacer’s face,\r\nas much as to say, “You big duffer, have you quit already?” And then,\r\nlike a homing pigeon loosed for the first time, she sailed away from\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\n“Princewood! Princewood will break the record!” shouted a man who\r\nhadn’t caught on and was yelling for Princewood while looking at the\r\nchampion pumpkin in the window of the agricultural hall.\r\n\r\nAnd then the old Colonel lost his head and, I am sorry to say, the most\r\nof his religion, for he jumped up on a bench and shouted so loud the\r\ntown crier heard him in the court-house window, a mile away: “_Damn\r\nPrincewood! Damn the record! It’s Little Sister! Little Sister! Old\r\nBetty’s filly--my old mare’s colt!_”\r\n\r\nAnd then Uncle John laughed till he nearly fell out of the sulky. “I\r\nsaid he’d be telling all about her first,” he said, while a little\r\ninnocent-looking tot plucked the old man by the coat-tail long enough\r\nto get him to stop telling the crowd all about the marvelous breeding\r\nof the wonderful filly, as she naively remarked: “And the little thing\r\ndid play off on you sure enough, didn’t she, Grandpa?”\r\n\r\nThe crowd laughed, and Grandma picked her up, kissed her, and shouted:\r\n“And here’s the girl that saved her, gentlemen--the smartest girl in\r\nTennessee--and she’s got more horse sense than her old granddaddy!”\r\n\r\nThere was one more heat, of course; but it was only a procession, and\r\nthose behind cannot swear to this day which way Little Sister went.\r\n\r\n  JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA History of the Hals\r\n\r\n\r\nBy JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPT. THOMAS GIBSON. Owner of Gibson’s Tom Hal and John\r\nDilliard.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. THE PACING RACE HORSE.\r\n\r\n  Full-muscled, clean, clear-cut, without a flaw,\r\n  Deep-chested--shallow where the quick flanks draw--\r\n  Round-footed, flat and flinty in the bone,\r\n  Eyes full and flashing, as the opal stone,\r\n  Neck like the deep-grooved classic column’s ply--\r\n  Massive at base, tap’ring towards the sky,\r\n  Ears thin and slender, velvet-pointed, fine\r\n  As the unbursted leaflets of the columbine.\r\n  Shoulders well back, slanting, thin and strong,\r\n  Ribbed close as steel, where girders run along;\r\n  Quarters long and massive, rubber-hard and round,\r\n  Quick in the stride, but quicker in rebound--\r\n  Back like the beam that held Pantheon’s dome--\r\n  Gods, give the word, and see this horse come home!\r\n\r\n  JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE.\r\n\r\nThe race horse has come, by common consent to represent all that is\r\ngraceful and grand in the animal kingdom. The culmination of perfected\r\nstrength and speed, courage and intelligence, he stands, nevertheless,\r\nthe model of patience, gentleness and forbearance. How wonderful it\r\nseems that in this dumb creature, whose mental gifts, compared to\r\nman’s, are as a clay bed to a bank of violets, yet has he reached,\r\nthrough the misty channels of mere instinct, a physical perfection and\r\noften a moral excellence which his maker and molder may never attain!\r\nHe is amiable in spite of force and desperate races, and often blows\r\nand cruelty; he is gentle, notwithstanding a training tending to make\r\nhim a whirlwind of wrath and a tornado of tempests; he is honest in\r\nspite of the dishonesty of those around him and docile and contented\r\ndespite the fact that there slumbers within him like sleeping bolts in\r\na flying cloud the spirit of madness gathered from the nerve granaries\r\nof a long line of unnumbered ancestors.\r\n\r\nA regiment with his courage would ride over the guns of a Balaklava;\r\na state with his honesty would need no criminal laws; give scholars\r\nhis patience, and the stars would be their playthings; imbued with\r\nhis power of endurance, the weakest nation would tunnel mountains as\r\na child a sand hill, build cities as a dreamer builds castles, and\r\nshoulder the world with a laugh. To one who sees him as he is, and\r\nloves him for his intrinsic greatness, he is all this and more. Man’s\r\nhonest servant, dumb exemplar, truest helper, best friend.\r\n\r\nIn his master’s hour of recreation, he is the joyful spirit that whirls\r\nhim, at the swish of a whip, along the dizzy course where the whistling\r\nwinds sing their warning. In his hours of stern reality, when fortunes\r\nhang on his hoof beats and fame stands balanced on the wire that ends\r\nthe home-stretch, he is the embodiment of power and dignity, the\r\nchampion of might and the god of victory. And finally, in his gentler\r\nmoods, he is the faithful servant of the stubble and the plow, the\r\ngentle guardian of the family turn-out, who hauls the laughing children\r\nalong the by-ways amid the sweet grasses, where the sunshine and the\r\nzephyrs play. Out from the past, the dim, bloody, shifting past, came\r\nthis noble animal, the horse, side by side with man, fighting with\r\nhim the battles of progress, bearing with him the burdens of the\r\ncenturies. Down the long, hard road, through flint or mire, through\r\nswamp or sand, wherever there has been a footprint, there also will be\r\nseen a hoof-print. They have been one and inseparable, the aim and the\r\nobject, the means and the end. And if the time shall ever come, as some\r\nboastingly declare, when the one shall breed away from the other, the\r\npuny relic of a once perfect manhood will not live long enough to trace\r\nthe record of it on the tablet of time.\r\n\r\nThe greatest distinct family of horses that has ever lived is the\r\nHal family of pacers, a distinctively Tennessee product, originating\r\nin that peculiar geological formation known as the Middle Basin--the\r\nbluegrass region of Tennessee. To understand the greatness of this\r\nfamily of horses--now known throughout the world, wherever speed and\r\nendurance has a name--it is only necessary to publish the following\r\ntable of world-records held by them. These records have all been won\r\nin the last quarter of a century, the remarkable fact being that\r\nbefore that time these horses lived only for the plow, the saddle\r\nor the wheel, and that nearly all of them are sons and daughters or\r\ndescendants of one horse--a roan, known locally as Gibson’s Tom Hal,\r\nfrom the fact that Capt. Thomas Gibson, a gentleman of the old school,\r\nthen living on his estate in Maury County, Tenn., and now the efficient\r\nsecretary of the Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Railway Library,\r\nfirst reclaimed him from obscurity and brought him to the county where\r\nhis greatness was recognized.\r\n\r\nThese world records, the choicest in the harness world, are held\r\nto-day, August, 1905, by the descendants of the old roan pacer:\r\n\r\n  1. First horse to go a mile in harness in 2 minutes, Star Pointer,\r\n  1:59-1/4.\r\n\r\n  2. Fastest 4-year-old mare, The Maid, 2:05-1/4.\r\n\r\n  3. Fastest green performer (1905), Walter Direct, 2:05-3/4.\r\n\r\n  4. Fastest heat in a race, stallion, Star Pointer, 2:00-1/2.\r\n\r\n  5. Fastest heat in a race, mare, Fanny Dillard, 2:03-3/4.\r\n\r\n  6. Fastest first heat in a race, Star Pointer, 2:02.\r\n\r\n  7. Fastest third heat in a race, Star Pointer, 2:00-1/2.\r\n\r\n  8. Fastest fifth heat in a race, The Maid, 2:05-3/4.\r\n\r\n  9. Fastest two heats in race (Dariel and) Fanny Dillard, 2:03-3/4,\r\n  2:05.\r\n\r\n  10. Fastest three consecutive heats in a race, Star Pointer,\r\n  2:02-1/2, 2:03-1/2, 2:03-3/4.\r\n\r\n  11. Fastest three heats in a race, Star Pointer, 2:02-1/2, 2:03-1/2,\r\n  2:03-3/4.\r\n\r\n  12. Fastest seven-heat race, The Maid, 2:07-1/4, 2:07-1/4, 2:05-1/4,\r\n  2:09, 2:05-3/4, 2:07, 2:08-3/4.\r\n\r\n  13. Fastest mile in a race to wagon, Angus Pointer, 2:04-1/2.\r\n\r\n  14. Fastest team, Direct Hal and Prince Direct, 2:05-1/2.\r\n\r\n  15. Fastest three-heat in race to wagon, Angus Pointer, 2:06-1/4,\r\n  2:04-1/2, 2:06-1/4.\r\n\r\n  16. Fastest green performer, stallion, Direct Hal, 2:04-1/2.\r\n\r\n  17. Fastest team in a race, Charley B and Bobby Hal, 2:13.\r\n\r\n  18. Fastest pacing team, amateur trials, Prince Direct and Morning\r\n  Star, 2:06.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that all of these records except a few were made in\r\nraces and not against time.\r\n\r\nWhence came this wonderful family of horses? What is this pacing gait?\r\nWhat mingling of blood lines have brought these horses of the plow, the\r\nsaddle and the wheel to the grandstand and the pinacle of fame?\r\n\r\nThis is the story I shall tell as a serial during the first twelve\r\nissues of Trotwood’s Monthly.\r\n\r\nThe light-harness horse has come to be a type of its own. It is\r\ndistinctly an American type, as distinguished from the English running,\r\nor thoroughbred horse, the German and French coach, the Russian Orloff\r\nand horses of other nationalities. There is a wide gap, however,\r\nbetween a race horse, whether runner or harness horse, and other\r\nbreeds, however pure, their blood lines. It is the difference of\r\nintelligence, speed, endurance, of lung development, of steel bone. It\r\nis the difference between genius and mediocracy--for speed is to the\r\nhorse what genius is to man.\r\n\r\nWhence began this speed--in the English runner, in the American trotter\r\nand pacer? Traced back, the sheiks of the desert might tell; they who\r\nworshipped the midnight stars, or chased on steeds of fire the wild\r\nantelope of the plains, before Abraham came from “Ur of the Chaldees.”\r\nKnowing the past now from the present, seeing it so clearly through\r\nthe glasses of twentieth century science, knowing the laws of the\r\n“survival of the fittest,” that land and air and sand and sun make both\r\nthe physical man as well as the physical horse, we can easily guess\r\nwhat centuries of wild gallops across the desert will do for the horse,\r\nsupplemented by that natural love of him in his master--that love which\r\nbrings care and kindness and the exercise of common sense in mating and\r\nmaternity.\r\n\r\nAs to the American horse, there are two distinct classes, based on\r\ntheir respective gaits--the trotter and the pacer. In another chapter\r\nthese respective gaits are fully discussed, their difference shown,\r\ntheir origin and the speed attained by each. This brief history will\r\ndeal only with the pacing gait, but so closely are these two great\r\ngaits related, and so often do the blood lines of trotter and pacer\r\nrun in parallel columns that it is necessary for a clear explanation\r\nof the subject to say a foreword about the trotter, that grand type of\r\nbeauty, speed and utility, so purely American and so superbly great\r\nthat the very mention of his name should excite a patriotic glow in the\r\nbosom of every American who loves his country and her just fame.\r\n\r\nThe history of the trotting horse began with Messenger, a gray\r\nthoroughbred foaled in 1780, and imported from England to America in\r\nMay, 1788. He was royally bred for his time, being by Mambrino, son\r\nof Engineer, and through both sire and dam he traced to the famous\r\nGodolphin Arabian. An old description of him says he was 15-3/4\r\nhands high, with “a large, long head, rather short, straight neck,\r\nwith wind-pipe and nostrils nearly twice as large as ordinary; low\r\nwithers, shoulders somewhat upright, but deep and strong; powerful\r\nloins and quarters; hocks and knees unusually large, and below them\r\nlimbs of medium size, but flat and clean and, whether at rest or in\r\nmotion, always in perfect position.” With this beginning, in 1822, a\r\nNorfolk trotter called Bellfounder, who had trotted two miles in six\r\nminutes, and had challenged all England to a trot, was imported. It\r\nwas his daughter in which the strains of Messenger met that produced\r\nHambletonian 10, the head of the trotting type in America, the first\r\ngreat trotting sire of the world, and through him perpetuated by his\r\ngreat sons, such as Geo. Wilkes, Electioneer, Dictator, and their\r\ndescendants. Through all these years the trotting record has gradually\r\nbeen reduced, first by one great trotter and then another, beginning\r\nwith the first queen of the trotting turf, Lady Suffolk, and ending\r\nwith that superb little thing of fire and speed and sweetness, Lou\r\nDillon. Literally, in that century of progress millions of dollars\r\nhave been spent, not only by thousands of small breeders, but by such\r\nfinancial magnates and great breeders as Vanderbilt, Sanford, Bonner,\r\nBackman, Alexander, Forbes, Lawson and others, chiefly in New York, New\r\nEngland, Kentucky and California.\r\n\r\nThe effect of all this was to create that splendid race of trotters now\r\nknown all over the world, and to produce a horse capable of trotting a\r\nmile in two minutes or better.\r\n\r\nBut even before the advent of Messenger there had developed in the\r\neastern coast of the Colonies, chiefly in Delaware and Rhode Island, a\r\nfamily of extremely fast pacers known as the Narragansetts, an account\r\nof which will be seen a few chapters further on. These horses were\r\nsmall, but game, docile, excellent under the saddle, and used almost\r\nexclusively for travel in those early days of pioneer roads. Their\r\nspeed was marvelous, if the testimony of Rev. Dr. McSparrow, 1721, an\r\nEnglish minister who was stationed in the Colonies, may be accepted as\r\nproof. This reverend gentleman, writing to a friend in England says\r\nthat he has seen them pace in races under saddle, going a mile in “a\r\nlittle less than two and a good deal better than three minutes.”\r\n\r\nHowever, for nearly two centuries the pacer never was thought of as\r\na factor in horse development, especially as a race horse until the\r\nadvent of the Hal family of Tennessee, in the early 70’s, with Little\r\nBrown Jug and Mattie Hunter, although the great bloodlines and speed\r\nof Pocahontas, James K. Polk and other noted pacers in the early ’40’s\r\nought to have foretold what great possibilities lay in the despised\r\npacing gait. As usual, the rejected stone found itself in the key of\r\nthe arch, and out of Tennessee, by what some might term chance, but in\r\nfact the legitimate product of scientific breeding, of soil, of climate\r\nand grass, out of an obscure family of saddle horses, bred with no idea\r\nof racing and with never a thought of fame, but taken, like Coriolanus,\r\nliterally from the plow, this horse is found--the first to go a mile\r\nin two minutes or better, and to do almost without price and without\r\neffort what the millionaires of horsedom had spent fortunes to do in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\nThis was first accomplished by Star Pointer, at Readville, Mass.,\r\nSeptember 2, 1897.\r\n\r\nSuch a family deserves to be perpetuated in history, however brief it\r\nmay be and unpretentiously written. And I beg the future as well as the\r\npresent historian not to criticise too closely its style, for in it,\r\nas I go along, a hundred fancies will twine themselves with my facts.\r\nThere is so much about man and horse that is akin. There is so much of\r\nhuman nature in both--there is such a chance for moralizing on their\r\nlife, their death, their fame, their fortune, their brief days’ strut\r\non the stage of time, their passing out--“and the rest is silence.”\r\nAnd, speaking of fame in both man and horse, is it not all a lottery?\r\n\r\nWith men she is a sly and uncertain goddess, coming seldom to those who\r\ncourt her, and often to others who care nothing for her, so, in the\r\nrearing of race-horses the same uncertainty exists, and matron after\r\nmatron bred in purple lines may go on throwing quitters and lunkheads\r\nyear after year, while some obscure dam, whose breeding is barely\r\ntolerable, but stamped by nature with a spirit of fire and a soul of\r\nsteel, sends out from some hithertofore obscure breeders’ farm a race\r\nhorse that sets a new mark for speed and a new fashion for blood lines.\r\n\r\nIn a decision, Judge Gaynor, of the Supreme Court of King’s County,\r\nNew York, in a case against the president of the Gravesend track,\r\nwhere runners are raced, held that horse racing was not a lottery.\r\nThis may be true within the technical meaning of the term, lottery,\r\nbut if the honorable court had held that breeding race horses was not\r\na lottery, we have our doubt whether the decision would have met with\r\nthe unanimous consent of the breeders themselves. And, as we remarked\r\nabove, fame itself is not more uncertain.\r\n\r\nThere is so much similarity between man and horse that a student of\r\neither will constantly find himself comparing the two. Almost every\r\nquality possessed by man has its counterpart, though often in a less\r\ndegree, in man’s favorite animal, while now and then the master fails\r\nto come up to the many excellencies of his beast. A good judge of\r\nhuman nature is invariably a good judge of horses and horse nature. In\r\nfact, so well understood is this rule that “horse sense” in man has\r\ncome to have a definite meaning of its own, and classes the human thus\r\nfavored with a common sense stronger than usual.\r\n\r\nIt is almost certain failure for erring man to struggle only to be\r\nfamous. She never yet came in all her splendor to the impetuous wooer.\r\nLike Cleopatra, who secretly tired of the infatuated Anthony, who could\r\nnot fight at Actium for thoughts of her, and secretly died for love of\r\nthe young Caesar who heartily despised the character of the ancient\r\nLangtry, so also with fame. “God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb,”\r\nand perhaps knows if he allowed the fools who burn up their lives and\r\ntheir midnight oil seeking to become famous, to become so, their heads\r\nwould burst with conceit or their own vanity would wreck them. But\r\non the other hand, He often showers on those who honestly fight for\r\nright, regardless of consequences, who care more for principle than\r\nfor worldly honor, and more for truth than for glory, and who do their\r\nwhole duty regardless of consequences, the greatest fame and honor.\r\nThe strutting peacock has all he can carry in his gaudy plumage and\r\nresplendent feathers. It would have been as much a sacrilege to have\r\nadded these decorations to either Ulysses S. Grant or Robert E. Lee, as\r\nit would have been cruel to deprive John Pope and Robert Tombs of them.\r\nAnd the gap between the pairs is the true distance between fame and\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\nThe wild, reckless and dissipated young rake, who left Rome more to\r\nbe rid of his creditors than to fight the Gauls, never dreamed of the\r\nglory in store for him as he threw the fire of his soul in his work and\r\nblazed his way to fame both with a pen and sword--each so resplendently\r\nbright that the student of to-day is lost in wonder and admiration\r\nas he endeavors to decide on which Caesar’s greatest claim to renown\r\nrests. “Here lies one whose name is written on water,” is the epitaph\r\nwhich the poor, gentle, timid Keats begged to have carved on his tomb,\r\nbegged it as he lay dying from shafts of cruelty and malice. And yet,\r\nhis fame is as enduring as his art, and that is “a thing of beauty” and\r\n“a joy forever.” “What have I done to be worthy of this great honor?”\r\nasked Washington, when he heard he was elected the first president of\r\nthe Republic. Shakespeare was silent, morose, dissatisfied, as all true\r\nartists are, with his own work, and judging from the epitaph, which it\r\nis said he himself wrote, it appears he was fearful he might not have\r\neven a place to rest his bones. And so, the world over. Simplicity is\r\ngreatness. Truth is fame. Honesty is glory. If you doubt it compare\r\nAgricola and Cataline; Washington and Arnold; Paul and Iscariot;\r\nShakespeare and Sheridan.\r\n\r\nIn the same line of reasoning it is an hundred to one when a breeder,\r\npinning everything on a pedigree, an individuality, or some supposed\r\nexcellency, ever hits the mark. It is said that the same man once\r\nowned Kittrell’s Tom Hal and Copperbottom. The latter he thought was\r\nthe better horse; the former was ignored. Time has shown, perhaps to\r\nhis loss, the owner’s error. An exchange recently published a story of\r\nhow a prospective buyer went to purchase one or two colts. The first\r\nwas Hambletonian 10, then, I think, a yearling; the second was a horse\r\ncalled Abdallah. He regarded Abdallah the handsomest, the speediest,\r\nthe best. He spent a good deal of time in his examination, and as they\r\nwere priced the same, showing that even the owners had not discovered\r\nany difference, he finally purchased the Abdallah colt, and, the writer\r\nadds, “The first went to fame, the second to a double-tree.”\r\n\r\nBut some people think horse-breeding is not a lottery. Why, even\r\nman-breeding is.\r\n\r\nAnd so the Hal family, thinking not of fame, find it thrust upon them.\r\n\r\n(To be Continued.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE LAST HYMN OF THE BILOXI\r\n\r\n(The Biloxi, a noble tribe of Indians who lived on the Gulf Coast many\r\ncenturies ago, were defeated in battle and besieged in their last\r\nremaining fortress by an unrelenting enemy. Choosing rather to die in\r\nthe sea than to be captured and enslaved, they marched out of their\r\ngate on a moonlit night, singing a death chant, a stately procession\r\nof men, women and children, and continued seaward until the waves\r\nswallowed them up. Their enemies stood on the shore and watched them,\r\nstruck with surprise and admiration. The remains of their last fortress\r\nis said to be still standing at Biloxi, Miss., and to this day there is\r\nheard a weird music which comes in from the Gulf, oftenest on still,\r\nmoonlit nights, which the natives call “The Last Hymn of the Biloxi.”)\r\n\r\n  Over the sea, the silent sea,\r\n  Faint is the music that comes to me.\r\n            Pitifully pealing.\r\n            Silently stealing.\r\n  Kissing the waves so tenderly.\r\n\r\n  Starlight above--June--chirrup of crickets--\r\n  Fireflies and phantoms of stars in the glow.\r\n  Corn in the tassel--faint odor of pollen--\r\n  Blow! ye soft night winds, our requiem, blow--\r\n  Dear land that has known us, no more will ye know.\r\n\r\n  Over the sea, the moonlit sea,\r\n  Sad is the music that comes to me.\r\n            Echoing--dying--\r\n            Sobbing--sighing--\r\n  Song of a race that would ever be free.\r\n\r\n  Death in the land--grim death in the battle--\r\n  Death--and worse death--for mother and maid.\r\n  Bravely we fought, but Fate did not favor--\r\n  Sons of Biloxi, ye were never afraid--\r\n  In caverns of corals our bones shall be laid.\r\n\r\n  Over the sea, the crooning sea\r\n  (Weird as the wail of a wraith, to me).\r\n            Soft as the light dew\r\n            Falling the night through.\r\n  Faint as a sea-shell’s lullaby.\r\n\r\n  Moonlight around--mist, mist on the water--\r\n  Mist--’tis the drapery of Death on the deep.\r\n  White-robed we come--babe, mother and maiden--\r\n  Priest--warrior--pity us, sweet sea, and keep--\r\n  Dear Sea that has nursed us, in thee let us sleep.\r\n\r\n  Into the sea, the soothing sea.\r\n  Singing, they entered, and died to be free.\r\n            Now, when the echoing wave\r\n            Sobs o’er their coral grave.\r\n  It sings the last hymn of the brave Biloxi.\r\n\r\n  JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTesting and Redeeming Soils\r\n\r\n\r\nBY H. ALISON WEBSTER.\r\n\r\nWith the population of the world ever increasing, and the acreage of\r\nfertile lands ever decreasing, with the consequent increasing demand\r\nfor, and decreasing supply of all products of the soil, is not the\r\nduty of redeeming worn-out lands, enriching naturally poor lands and\r\npreserving the fertility of fertile lands a duty that every land owner\r\nowes to posterity? If the results of robbing the soil of its plant\r\nfoods has already been felt by the farmer, and if such a practice\r\nbe continued, what will be the condition of the same soil by the\r\ntime it descends to his great-grandchildren? If the vast majority of\r\nthe inhabitants of the globe are poor, and scarcely able to provide\r\nfood and raiment at the present prices, what will be the fate of\r\nsuch a people when prices rise higher and higher, as will be the\r\ninevitable result of an inadequate supply? Is confidence the cause\r\nof such shameful neglect, or does the farmer lack confidence in the\r\npracticability of the results of scientific research? It is true that\r\nthe great variety of objects in nature are extremely bewildering, and\r\nif every farmer were forced to comprehend God’s creations in order\r\nto equip himself to cultivate his land intelligently, the soil would\r\ncontinue to get poorer and poorer, as the useful years of a long life\r\nwould pass in study; but men of science, in the past and present\r\ngenerations, by faithful and noble work, have reduced all to simple\r\nfacts to be made practicable by the farmer, and there is no longer any\r\nexcuse for ignorance and neglect. Study the results of the work of\r\nthese men of science. Put them into practice. Experiment and work with\r\nthe soil. Study it and find out what it needs, and having found out,\r\nsupply the right thing in the right way at the right time. It is work,\r\nhard work; but the reward is generous. In the words of Mr. Charles\r\nBarnard, “Try things and learn, and having learned, do what is right by\r\nyour soil, and it will return all your labor in full measure, running\r\nover, and your children will inherit the land as a well-kept trust and\r\nblessing.”\r\n\r\nAs stated, things have been greatly simplified. Chemists, by thousands\r\nof experiments, have found in all sixty-five single separate things\r\nthey call elements. Seventeen of these elements are in the soil. Out\r\nof these seventeen the farmer is obliged to provide only four, as\r\nthe remaining thirteen, with favorable weather and proper tillage of\r\nthe soil, will take care of themselves. The four to be provided are\r\nnitrogen, potassium, phosphorus and calcium. The first three elements\r\nare the most important, as they are plant foods or fertilizers. The\r\nlast, calcium, or lime, is a stimulant, and serves in the capacity of\r\nneutralizing the acids of the soil. Lime is abundant in many soils and\r\nin such soils is not needed; but where it is needed it is needed badly\r\nand should be supplied. Nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus are the\r\nplant foods that are yearly consumed in various quantities by various\r\ncrops, which are taken away and sold or otherwise disposed of. They\r\nare foods absolutely necessary to plant life, and if taken away and\r\nnever returned, the soil is as certain to become poor and exhausted\r\nas the sun is to set in the west. This is the sum and substance of\r\nthe whole matter. What you take from the soil, you have to replace or\r\nsuffer loss. Your soil may need one, two, three or all four of the\r\nelements. What it requires can be found out by experiment, as will\r\nbe shown further on. These elements as everyone must know, can be\r\neasily obtained at costs varying with, and depending upon, the form\r\nin which they are bought, or methods by which they are secured. The\r\nall-important thing is to study the soil and prepare it to accept\r\nand properly appropriate whatever foods are applied. No fertilizer\r\nis insurance against laziness and ignorance. It takes work and\r\nintelligence to accomplish any task. Study your soil, and you will\r\nappreciate the fact that it has a constitution like yourself, and\r\nwill get worn out, and sick, and need physic just as you do. After\r\nknowing its constitution, you can prescribe and administer the physic\r\nit requires. No doctor can prescribe medicine intelligently without\r\nknowing the constitution of his patient.\r\n\r\nNaturally, though unfortunately, men of science, so far as the farmer\r\nis concerned, are quite as intricate in their explanations of the\r\nobjects of nature, as are the objects themselves. Mr. Charles Bernard\r\nin his “Talks About Soils,” published by Funk & Wagnalls, New York, is\r\nthe first to reduce matters to a practical plane. His explanations and\r\nexperiments I therefore adopt to simplify and make clear many things\r\nwhich are of unquestionable importance.\r\n\r\nThe soil having been formed, in the main, by the weathering away of\r\nthe rocks, its foundation is either sand or clay or both combined.\r\nOn account of different quantities of sand and clay being found in\r\ndifferent soils, and to distinguish one from another, soils have been\r\ndivided into six classes. These are as follows:\r\n\r\nA Light Sand.--This is a soil containing ninety per cent of sand. If it\r\nhad more sand and less of clay and other matter it would hardly produce\r\nany useful plants, and could not fairly be called a soil.\r\n\r\n2. A Pure Clay.--This would be a soil in which no sand could be found.\r\nA pure clay soil would be wet and cold, and would not be good for our\r\ncommon plants. Such soils are rare: and what is commonly called a pure\r\nclay soil is one containing a great excess of clay, and only a little\r\nsand or other matter.\r\n\r\n3. A Loam.--This is one of the best of all soils. Such a soil contains\r\nboth sand and clay as well as other matter.\r\n\r\n4. A Sandy Loam.--This is a mixture of sand and clay, with more sand\r\nthan clay.\r\n\r\n5. A Clay Loam.--This is a mixture in which there is more clay than\r\nsand.\r\n\r\n6. A Strong Clay.--This is a clay containing from five to twenty per\r\ncent of sand and other matter.\r\n\r\nExperiments with Sand and Clay.--Procure a quart of pure sand and\r\nspread it out in the sun to dry, and when dry place a small quantity\r\non a spoon, and hold over a hot fire. The heat has no effect upon it.\r\nRemove the spoonful of sand from the fire, and it will be found that\r\nthe sand keeps its heat for a long time. Place a small quantity of sand\r\nin a small sieve and pour water over it. The water at first flows away\r\nmore or less discolored, and presently runs quickly through the sand\r\npure and clean. While wet the sand sticks together slightly. Place it\r\nin the air, and it soon dries, and the grains are as loose as before.\r\nPlace a little of the washed sand in a bottle filled with water. Cork\r\nthe bottle and shake it up. The sand will move about as long as the\r\nwater is in motion, but the instant the bottle is at rest, it falls\r\nto the bottom, and forms a layer under the clear water. Place some\r\nof the sand in an oven or in the sun till perfectly dry. Place three\r\ntablespoonfuls of water in a saucer, and then pour carefully into the\r\nsaucer a cupful of dry sand. It becomes wet around the little heap\r\nwhile still dry at the top; soon the water will begin to creep up the\r\nsand and in a short time it is all wet, and remains wet as long as\r\nthere is water in the saucer.\r\n\r\nThese experiments show us that sand is not affected by heat, and that\r\nit keeps its heat for some time; that water passes through it readily\r\nand, if clean, the water passes through pure and clean. When wet it is\r\nvery slightly sticky, when dry this stickiness disappears completely.\r\nIn water it sinks the moment the water is at rest. Water rises through\r\nit easily by capillary attraction.\r\n\r\nAnother experiment, taking more time, is to place some clean sand in a\r\nflower pot, wet it, and sprinkle fine grass-seeds over it. Place in a\r\nwarm room and the seeds will soon sprout and send small roots down into\r\nthe sand.\r\n\r\nThese experiments show some of the characteristics of all soils\r\ncomposed largely of sand. We observed that sand when heated retains its\r\nheat for some time. Any soil having a large proportion of sand, when\r\nwarmed by the sun will keep the heat after the sun has set or is hid by\r\nthe clouds. We proved that water would flow quickly through it. A sandy\r\nsoil is therefore a dry soil, and for this reason favorable to nearly\r\nall our useful plants. We saw that water would rise through sand by\r\ncapillary attraction, which makes sand useful in soil in dry weather to\r\nbring water up from a damp subsoil to feed the roots of plants growing\r\nin the soil.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are objections to sand. As we saw, it is loose and\r\neasily moved about by water. A sandy soil is therefore easily washed\r\naway by rains, and, if too sandy, may suffer great injury by washing in\r\nheavy storms. Water flows through sand quickly, and if there is no damp\r\nsubsoil immediately beneath, the soil may get so dry that plants will\r\nburn up. The water may also wash down all the light organic matter out\r\nof reach of the plants.\r\n\r\nWe observed that sand is easily moved about. This is important in that\r\nall soils where plants are growing must be frequently stirred, to let\r\nair come into the soil, and to kill the weeds. A sandy soil is easy to\r\nhoe or plow, because the sand is loose. This saves time and money, or\r\nwork in caring for plants, and is a business advantage.\r\n\r\nIf you carry out the experiment with seeds planted on sand you will\r\nobserve that the roots of the young plants easily find their way\r\nthrough the sand in search of food and water. This shows that a soil\r\ncontaining sand is favorable to the growth of plants, because in it\r\ntheir roots spread in every direction.\r\n\r\nProcure a small quantity of clay from some clay bank. Place in a\r\nwarm place to dry, and in a day or two you can crush it into a soft,\r\nimpalpable powder. Pinch a little between the fingers and it appears\r\nto stick together slightly. Place some in a bottle of water, cork it\r\ntight and shake the bottle. The powder floats in the water in clouds,\r\ntill the water appears completely filled with it. Let the bottle stand\r\nand it will be many hours before the clay settles and the water becomes\r\nclear. Wet some of the dry clay, and it forms a sticky, pasty mass,\r\nthat has a soft, greasy feeling between the fingers. Spread some of the\r\nsoft, pasty mass over a sieve, and pour water on it and the water will\r\nhardly pass through the sieve at all. Spread some wet clay over a rough\r\nboard, and pour water over it, and the clay will cling to the board a\r\nlong time before it is swept away. Place a lump of wet clay in the sun\r\nand it will be many hours before it is entirely dry. Spread some of the\r\nwet clay over a dish and place it in the sun, and when it slowly dries\r\nit will be found full of cracks. Place a lump of wet clay in an oven\r\nand it will dry hard like stone.\r\n\r\nPlace some of the wet clay in a pot and scatter fine seeds over it.\r\nThe seeds may sprout and try to grow, but they will probably perish as\r\ntender roots are unable to push their way through the sticky clay.\r\n\r\nAfter all these experiments have been performed with the clay and sand,\r\nanother experiment can be made by drying both the clay and sand and\r\nthen mixing them together in equal parts. When well mixed place in a\r\npot and scatter fine seeds upon the mixture. Water well, and place in\r\na sunny window; and the plants will sprout and grow longer and better\r\nthan in either the pure sand or pure clay.\r\n\r\nThese experiments with the lump of clay show that if soil consists\r\nwholly of clay, it must be a poor place for plants. In every hard rain\r\nthe water, instead of sinking into the soil to supply the plants, would\r\nrun away over the surface and be wasted. After slow soaking rains the\r\nsoil would remain wet and cold for a long time. When the sun dries the\r\nsoil it splits and cracks and tears the roots of plants growing in it.\r\nThis sticky, pasty soil sticks to spade and plows and we find it hard,\r\nslow work to cultivate it. A pure clay from these would appear to be\r\na poor soil for plants. We must not, however, be led astray by our\r\nexperiments, as it is not easy to find a soil composed wholly of clay.\r\nIt is usually mixed with other things and then forms a valuable part of\r\nthe best soils. Sand alone would be a poor soil. Clay alone would be a\r\npoorer soil. Mixed together and mixed with other things, they make a\r\npart of all good soils.\r\n\r\nOrganic and Inorganic Matter.--Organic matter is something that has\r\nlife, or has had life at some time. The organic matter in the soil has\r\nbeen supplied by animals and plants, in one way or another. All else\r\nis inorganic. Both organic and inorganic matters are necessary to the\r\nexistence of plants. Peaty soils wholly organic will not grow plants,\r\nneither will sandy soils wholly sand. Inorganic matter forms the\r\nfoundation of soils and generally forms from eighty to ninety per cent\r\nof the whole soil.\r\n\r\nTesting Soils for Clay, Sand and Organic Matter.--Take from the ground\r\nyou wish to test, a peck of soil and place on a board in a round heap,\r\nand with a trowel stir it until completely mixed. Then pile into a\r\nheap and divide into four equal parts. Next weigh out eight ounces,\r\nand spread it out to dry. When dry weigh it and note the loss by\r\nair-drying. Next put the soil in a pan and place it in an oven for\r\nthree hours. Then take the soil out of the pan and weigh it, noting the\r\nloss by fire-drying. It is now dry soil and to estimate the organic\r\nand inorganic matter, place an iron shovel over the fire, and when\r\nred hot put the dry soil on it, let it burn, stirring it occasionally\r\nas it burns. It will smoke and smoulder away to ashes and dust. When\r\nit ceases to smoke, carefully weigh the ashes. This ash represents\r\nthe inorganic sand and clay parts of the soil. All the organic matter\r\ndisappeared in the smoke.\r\n\r\nNow take this ash and pour it in a bottle of water. Shake the bottle\r\nwell and then set on a table, and just so soon as the water becomes\r\nstill the sand will immediately settle at the bottom, while the clay\r\nwill remain for some time making the water muddy. As soon as the sand\r\nhas settled, pour the muddy or clay water off, being careful not to\r\npour any of the sand with it. Then pour some clear water in the bottle\r\non the sand, shake it and pour sand water and all on a cloth fine\r\nenough to catch the sand. Dry the sand and weigh it. If it weighs two\r\nounces, then out of the four ounces of dry soil you have tested you\r\nhave two ounces of sand, one ounce of clay and one ounce of organic\r\nmatter. Or your soil is twenty-five per cent organic matter and\r\ntwenty-five per cent clay, and fifty per cent sand. You have a loam\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nTesting Soils with Plant Foods and Lime.--In the field to be tested,\r\nselect as level a place as possible and mark out ten squares, each\r\nmeasuring one rod on each side. Place these in two rows leaving spaces\r\nthree feet wide between the squares. These empty spaces are to be kept\r\nclear of weeds and used as walks. Each square should be marked by\r\nstakes at the corners, and properly numbered as in the accompanying\r\ndiagram.\r\n\r\nThe squares are to be planted with the same crop and well cultivated\r\nthrough the season. Two of these squares, Nos. 2 and 9, are to have no\r\nfertilizers, that they may serve as a check or guide in testing the\r\nother squares. Square No. 1 is to have a fertilizer containing nitrogen\r\nonly. No. 4 potassium and phosphorous combined; No. 5 potassium alone;\r\nNo. 6 nitrogen and phosphorus; No. 7 phosphorus alone; No. 8 all three\r\nplant foods combined, and No. 10 is to have calcium only.\r\n\r\n  No. 1. Potassium and Nitrogen   No. 2. No Fertilizer\r\n\r\n  No. 3. Nitrogen                 No. 4. Potassium and Phosphorus\r\n\r\n  No. 5. Potassium                No. 6. Nitrogen and Phosphorus\r\n\r\n  No. 7. Phosphorus               No. 8. Nitrogen Phosphorus Potassium\r\n\r\n  No. 9. No Fertilizer            No. 10. Calcium\r\n\r\nApply the fertilizers and work them in the soil about four inches deep\r\nbefore the crop is planted. Plant the same variety of seed on all the\r\nsquares at the same time, and carefully cultivate through the entire\r\nseason, treating all exactly alike. Suppose that potatoes have been\r\nused. During the growing season, carefully watch the different plats\r\nand notice if any one or more seems more or less thrifty than others.\r\nNotice which plat appears to mature first, which blooms first and keep\r\na record of all observations. At the end of the season, carefully dig\r\nthe crop on each square, gathering all the tubers large and small,\r\nand weigh each lot. First weigh the crops on squares 2 and 9. This\r\nwill serve as a standard of comparison, as it will show the natural\r\ncondition of the soil. Record the weights in each lot and just for\r\nillustration we may say that they run something like this: Average of\r\n2 and 9, 80 pounds; No. 1, 380 pounds; No. 3, 250 pounds; No. 4, 360\r\npounds; No. 5, 350 pounds; No. 6, 300 pounds; No. 7, 220 pounds; No. 8,\r\n400 pounds; No. 10, 120 pounds.\r\n\r\nOn the particular soil we are supposed to be testing, we can clearly\r\nsee that the land is benefited in some degree by every element used.\r\nCalcium helps, and that means that it should be used on that soil\r\nin addition to all of the others. This land plainly needs all four\r\nelements and needs potassium especially.\r\n\r\nWhat to Do.--After having gone through with Mr. Barnard’s experiments,\r\nyou will have a practical idea of what your soil is, and what it needs.\r\nThe only remaining questions then are those of preparing the soil, and\r\nobtaining and applying the plant foods and the lime.\r\n\r\nA cold, wet, clay soil needs to be made warmer and lighter, and a\r\nlight, sandy soil, being too dry, needs some moisture-retaining\r\nsubstance. If conditions are favorable, it would be well at odd time\r\nto put sand on the clay soil and clay on the sandy soil; but in most\r\ncases this is too expensive, and therefore not practical. To redeem\r\npoor lands then, you will have to depend almost entirely upon green\r\nmanure and lime. Barnyard manures are, of course, at all times, with\r\nall soils, the best of all fertilizers, as they return to the soil by\r\nthe laws of nature, what has been taken from them, or what it should\r\nhave. Besides the plant foods, it furnishes additional organic matter\r\nor humus, which makes the soil lighter and facilitates plant growth by\r\nfurnishing food to bacteria essential to plant life. The trouble about\r\nbarn-yard manure is its scarcity. Every farm needs more plant food and\r\nhumus than can be supplied with common manure.\r\n\r\nIn the fall, apply 500 pounds of lime per acre to the poor land to be\r\nredeemed, break it and prepare it thoroughly, and seed it to rye. In\r\nthe spring when the rye heads out, turn it under and sow cow peas. When\r\nthe peas mature, scatter lime, 500 pounds to the acre, over them and\r\nturn them under. The lime will prevent the green stuff from souring the\r\nsoil, will decompose it and fit it for plant food, and will prepare the\r\nsoil to accept any other foods that may be applied. Follow the peas\r\nwith wheat, or wheat and clover.\r\n\r\nThe land once redeemed, do not wear it out again, but preserve its\r\nfertility by the use of high-grade commercial fertilizers and barn-yard\r\nmanure, always rotating the crops so as to get back to some leguminous\r\ncrop and lime at least once every four years.\r\n\r\nDo not retard agricultural education by making warfare on commercial\r\nfertilizers, for they are indispensable to every farmer in preserving\r\nthe fertility of the soil. The world employs the use of just about\r\none-tenth of the artificial fertilizers it should use, and about\r\none-half of what is used is used intelligently. Make war on low\r\ngrade fertilizers that have the attractive but deceiving feature of\r\ncheapness, and buy grade fertilizers by the unit under the guidance of\r\nthe requirements of your soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhosphatic Limestone.\r\n\r\nThe use of lime has been and is being sadly neglected, especially in\r\nthe Southern States and, when it is absolutely necessary to all soils\r\nin which it does not exist or exists only in small or insufficient\r\nquantities, it does look like the move to provide it is one of\r\nimperative moment. Look at the Bluegrass Region of Tennessee and\r\nKentucky, the fairest and most fertile of God’s country. What made\r\nit? The dissolution and weathering away of the original phosphatic\r\nlimestone rock. It is strictly a limestone country and teaches one of\r\nnature’s great lessons that the agricultural world should accept and be\r\nprofited thereby.\r\n\r\nAll the limestone of this region contains more or less bone phosphate\r\nof lime, and in this fact lies the whole secret. In the past ages the\r\nfoliage from the thick mass of trees and other vegetable growth fell\r\nto the ground, soured, and formed an acid which immediately attacked\r\nthe bone phosphate of lime and converted it into phosphoric acid, while\r\nthe calcium carbonate or lime decomposed all vegetable matter and\r\nconditioned it for plant food, neutralizing all acids and stood ready\r\nitself to enter into all future and standing vegetable growth. Now the\r\nforests have given place to the cleared fields and we no longer have\r\nthe dropping from the trees to enrich our soils, neither have we in\r\nour fields in sections devoid of limestone any vegetation with roots\r\nthat extend deep enough in the earth to bring up the carbonate of lime\r\nsufficient to support our crops. Therefore the vegetable matter the\r\ncheapest of all manures, we provide by turning under green leguminous\r\nor nitrogen-gathering plants. These plants sour and finally decompose,\r\nbut without carbonate of lime to perform its important duties of\r\ncreating plant food out of this decayed matter, all the fertilizer you\r\nget from your crop is the nitrogen it has gathered from the air. Then\r\nwhy not use powdered Tennessee phosphatic-limestone containing enough\r\ncalcium carbonate (not quick lime) to furnish desired results and no\r\nmore bone phosphate of lime than will be entirely and immediately\r\nconverted into plant food. If this phosphatic-limestone product is used\r\nwith leguminous crops, potash is the only plant food that you will have\r\nto provide during the two crop seasons following; however, every soil\r\nthat has a clay subsoil is a safe bank that will retain all you place\r\non deposit, and if you have the money to spare, deposit it in the soil\r\nby investing in high-grade fertilizers and draw a high rate of interest\r\non it instead of letting it stand idle. The calcium in the phosphatic\r\nlimestone will absolutely correct all free acids in the commercial\r\nfertilizers, the burning, deleterious effects of which you may have\r\nexperienced, and it will rectify the sourness of any and all soils.\r\n\r\nAn object lesson in favor of this phosphatic limestone is taught\r\nby riding along any turnpike macadamized with it and observing the\r\nrankness of the crops about fifty yards on either side of the pike,\r\nespecially where the fields are worn and poor. This demonstrates that\r\nit is the dust blown from the roads over into the fields that makes\r\nthe rank growth alongside the roads. It may be argued that the manure\r\ndropped on the pike produced the results; but if so small an amount\r\nof manure produced such wonderful results when mixed with the dust\r\nfrom the pike, what would be the result if you would mix all of your\r\nbarn-yard manure with the powdered limestone?\r\n\r\nRecently the writer made twelve tests or experiments with litmus paper.\r\nThe first ten of these experiments were made with blue litmus paper and\r\nsamples drawn from ten different fields, all of which have been under\r\ncultivation for many years and have had liberal yearly applications\r\nof acid fertilizers. The soils so tested are Alabama soils, and are\r\ndecidedly acid, as shown by the bits of blue litmus turning red on\r\ncoming in contact with them.\r\n\r\nEveryone must know that it takes lime to neutralize the acids of acid\r\nsoils; but comparatively few farmers ever take the trouble to find out\r\nwhether or not their soils are acid, even after failing to get a catch\r\nof clover three or four years in succession. All clovers positively\r\nrefuse to grow in acid soils. Inoculation will not do any good for\r\nbacteria cannot exist and operate in such soils. Sweeten the soil and\r\nnature will in most cases supply the bacteria.\r\n\r\nCarbonate of lime enters into the frame of every plant and a lack of\r\nit will cause soft stems and flabby leaves. It improves the chemical,\r\nmechanical and biological condition of the soil. It flocculates very\r\nlight, sandy soils, making them compact and capable of retaining\r\nmoisture, while it prevents clayey soils from becoming pasty hard and\r\nfull of cracks by causing them to crumble when dry.\r\n\r\nLime is the great carrier into plants of other elements which go there\r\nto form their organic compounds, during the elaboration of which,\r\norganic acids are created, any and all of which would poison and kill\r\nthe plants were it not for the action of lime; so lime, in addition\r\nto its all-importance as a salifiable base, becomes the great carrier\r\nof all foods into plants where it is again of paramount importance as\r\na fixer of oxalic fermentation, thus having the natural and distinct\r\npower to act where all other elements are useless.\r\n\r\nIt will correct sourness in any soil regardless of its origin, it will\r\nneutralize all acids that come into the soil through cultivation,\r\nthrough commercial fertilizers or green manurial crops. It will\r\nfacilitate cultivation and produce a greater porosity and granulation\r\nof all soils and thereby lessen the bad effects of drought by reducing\r\nsurface evaporation, will obviate excessive capillary rise of moisture\r\nwhich elevates the water-soluble foods above the zone of roots, provide\r\nbetter circulation of air in the soil and will cause rapid percolation\r\nof rain and thus reduce surface washing. It stimulates and increases\r\nnitrification and decomposes vegetable matter, extracting from it\r\nall plant foods and leaving humus to lighten the soil and retain\r\nits moisture. It enters into the composition of all plant life and\r\ntherefore into all animal life, giving to animals its carbon combined\r\nwith the carbon of the air to furnish them fat, and its lime to furnish\r\nthem bone. It is the phosphatic-limestone that has made Tennessee and\r\nKentucky horses the strength to excel in work and racing, and it is\r\nthis same soil constituent that has given to the Jersey cow sufficient\r\nbutter fat to lead the world in butter tests. It enables the clovers\r\nand grasses to grow, and without such crops what would the brothers of\r\nthe hoe do toward profitable farming and meeting the responsibilities\r\nof life? It perpetuates and permits the use of commercial fertilizers\r\nwhich are becoming so absolutely essential to husbandry, as it obviates\r\nthe evil effects of the acids these products contain, and makes all\r\nplant food available to the plant. Finally, it is a property designed\r\nby the Creator to act for and enter into all vegetable and animal life,\r\nand evil will be the reward to him who rejects it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Watermelon Sermon\r\n\r\n\r\nWatermelon time is in full blast in Tennessee now. Ordinarily, the\r\nwhites in the South cease to eat watermelons after the fifteenth of\r\nSeptember, because they know that as soon as the cool nights begin\r\nevery melon contains a thousand chills. But not so with the darkey.\r\nA chill rattles as harmlessly off the armour of his constitution as\r\nbuckshot from the back of the Olympia. He can absorb miasma like a\r\nsponge, and, like it, grow fat as he absorbs. The negro, then, eats his\r\nmelon until the November frosts kill the vines. Even then he carries\r\nthe half-ripe melon into his cabin and often, on Christmas morning, an\r\nice-cold watermelon is his first diet.\r\n\r\nAnd a great treat it is. Did you never wander over the fields, way\r\ndown South, after the cotton was all picked, and the November breezes\r\ncame cool and ladened with that delicate, indescribably rare flavor\r\nthe frost gives when it first nips the mellow-ripe muscadine? You\r\nhave shouldered your gun and gone out after old Mollie Cotton Tail.\r\nIt was cool and crisp when you went out, but toward noon it has grown\r\nhot again. Flushed and tired, you stop to rest by the big spring that\r\nflows from under the roots of the big oak near the cotton field. In\r\nthe shadow of that oak, half hid in the frost-bitten weeds, you find a\r\nlittle striped watermelon--a guinea melon, as the darkies call it--a\r\nkind of a volunteer melon that grows in the cotton every year, the\r\nfirst seeds of which were brought by some Guinea negro, from the coast\r\nof Africa, when he first came over to servitude, with silver rings in\r\nhis nose and ears. And though he failed to bring his idols and his\r\nhousehold gods along with him, yet did he not forget the melon of his\r\nnaked ancestors. Planting it as he hoed his first crop of cotton for a\r\nnew master, it has never deserted him since, and so, year after year,\r\nit comes up amid the cotton, to remind him of the days it grew wild in\r\na sunnier clime.\r\n\r\nAnd there you find it this November morning. Boy like, you pounce on\r\nit with a shout and soon it is laid open, as red as your first love’s\r\nlips and as sweet; and so cold it seems to have been raised in the\r\ndeep-delved cellars of all the centuries. I am sorry for the boy who\r\nhas grown to be a man and never, in a November morning’s hunt after Old\r\nMollie, had the exquisite sweetness of this satisfying surprise--the\r\nlike of which is not equalled by the sweetness of any other surprise on\r\nearth. No--not even should he grow to be a man, and awake some morning\r\nto find himself famous and the father of twins!\r\n\r\nEvery darkey of any standing in Tennessee “gives a treat” at least\r\nonce in his life. He will stint and economize for months to save money\r\nenough to invest in watermelons and tartaric acid (the acid makes\r\nthe lemonade). Then, when the glorious day arrives, Nero, giving free\r\nentertainment to the citizens of Eternal Rome, is not in it with that\r\ndarkey. Henceforth he can get anything in that community he wishes,\r\nfrom constable to presiding elder, while the widows of the church are\r\nhis’n by a large majority!\r\n\r\nI had heard that old Wash was going to run again for justice of the\r\npeace and the “deaconship of Zion” over in the coon district of Big\r\nSandy, and that he was going to give his annual treat.\r\n\r\nThese had always passed off beautifully and ended in the unanimous\r\nelection of the old man to both offices and anything else he wanted. I\r\nthought it was all over and entirely harmonious until he came in the\r\nother night, looking like Montejo’s flag-ship after Dewey’s ten-inch\r\nshell went through her, “a-rippin’ out her very innards”--as Old Wash\r\nhimself described it--“from eend to eend.”\r\n\r\nBut when I saw the old man, creeping into my library, I was certain he\r\nwas in the last stages of Asiatic cholera, and I rang the telephone\r\nhastily to get my family physician. But he feebly raised his hand, and\r\nbeckoned me to desist.\r\n\r\n“No, no, boss; he can’t do me no good--no good,” as he feebly sank into\r\na chair. Then he whispered:\r\n\r\n“Jes a drap, a leetle drap, on my tongue, boss--jes’ to let the old man\r\nshuffle off dis mortal coil wid a good taste in his mouth. It’s all I\r\nwants.”\r\n\r\nUnder the stimulant of that eternal beverage of moonlight and melody,\r\nhe revived a little.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter with you? Anybody been giving you a hoodoo,” I asked.\r\n\r\n“No, no, boss”--feebly--“I--I--I gin a treat at Big Sandy.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you have given many a treat at Big Sandy. Why should this one\r\nmake you look like a piney-wood coal-kiln after a cyclone had struck\r\nit?”\r\n\r\nIt took another dose from my side-board bottle to put enough life into\r\nthe old man to make him take any interest in things. Then he brightened\r\nup and said:\r\n\r\n“Dat’s jes’ hit--a man may go on doin’ de same trick year arter year,\r\nontwel it looks lak he cud do it wid his eyes shet, an’ den at last, if\r\nhe ain’t mighty keerful, hit’ll buck and fling ’im! De hardes’ luck,\r\nI take it, in dis wurl’, am when a man dun shuck de dice ob success\r\nontwell dey seem to bob up at his word, only to play off on him an’\r\nbust ’im es his palsied han’ shakes ’em fur de las’ time.”\r\n\r\nHis tears were flowing so freely and his remarks seemed so true and\r\nheartfelt, I did not have it in me to fail to brace him up with\r\nanother pull from the side-board bottle. Then I saw he was ripe and\r\nreminiscent, and I lit my cigar, struck an easy attitude, and let him\r\ndo the rest:\r\n\r\n“On de Sundy befo’ de fust Mundy ob de full moon in September,” he went\r\non, “cum off de ’lection fur ’ziden elder of Zion, an’ de next day\r\nam de day sot by law fur de ’lection of jestus ob de peace. So las’\r\nSat’d’y I gin a treat. I axed ebry nigger in de deestrict dar, an’ all\r\nde members of Zion, an’ Br’er Johnsing wus to preach de watermilion\r\nsermon.\r\n\r\n“Ain’t nurver heurd ob de watermilion sermon? Hit’s de sermon preached\r\nat de feast ob de watermilion jes’ befo’ de new moon in September,\r\nan’ it am one ob de doctrines ob Zion to kinder take de place ob de\r\nfeast ob de Passober ’mong de Jews--only in dis case we don’t pass\r\nober nuffin’, ’specially de watermilions. Now, hit tain’t eb’ry nigger\r\nkin preach de watermilion sermon. Hit takes a mighty juicy nigger to\r\ndo hit, yallar with dark stripes, juicy at de core, full of tears an’\r\nsweet penitence an’ easily laid open by the blade of grace, an’ brudder\r\nJohnsing am de slickest one I eber seed at it.\r\n\r\n“Now, dat wus my time to git in my fine Italyun han’, an’ so I gin\r\nit out that hit wus to be my treat, an’ I axed all de voters ob de\r\ndeestrick an’ all de members ob Zion ter be on han’ fur de revival ob\r\nde speerit an’ de refreshment ob de flesh.\r\n\r\n“’Cordin’ to my custom, jes’ befo’ de time fur de sermon I had all\r\nde watermilions laid out on de grass, one hundred ob de bigges’ an’\r\nfattes’ ones you eber seed. You see, boss, I am constertushunally\r\nupposed to long sermons,” he winked, “an’ I knowed dey wa’n’t a\r\nnigger libin’ c’uld preach ober ten minnits wid all dem watermilions\r\na-layin’ dar a-winkin’ at ’im an’ waiting to be led, lak’ lambs, to de\r\nsacrifice. Does you see de p’int?”\r\n\r\nI saw it.\r\n\r\n“Wal, suh, you orter jes’ heurd de prayer Br’er Johnsing put up--it\r\nwus short, but mighty sweet. De flavor ob de watermilions seem ter\r\ngit into hit, an’ de ’roma ob hits juice b’iled outen his mouth. Boss,\r\nyou’ve seed dese kinder preachers dat talks to de good Lord wid all\r\nde easy fermileriaty ob a deestrick skule-teacher axin’ de presedent\r\nob de skule board fur what he wants, an’ wid all de sassy assurance\r\nob de silent partner in a lan’-offis bisness, ain’t you? Wal, dat’s\r\nde way Br’er Johnsing prayed, an’ I wus de speshul objec, ob his\r\nconversashun wid de Almighty dat day. He tole ’im whut I’d dun fur\r\ndat community, informed ’im very posertively ob de fac’ dat I wus a\r\nGodly man, refreshed His mem’ry in a gentle way consarnin’ sum’ ob my\r\nlong-furgotten deeds ob cheerity, an’ gin Him sum’ good, brotherly\r\nadvice on how to git eben wid me, an’ in a measure pay off de debt\r\nof gratitude He owed me by makin’ it His will dat I wus erg’in to\r\nadminister de law ob de lan’, both spiritual an’ temper’l, an’ fur\r\nernudder twelvemonth ter be de venerbul ram ob de flock ob Zion, to\r\nlead His sheep to de fold an’ by de still waters. Wal, suh, when he\r\nfinish, mighty nigh eb’ry nigger dar said Amen, an’ den dey lick dey\r\nchops an’ look sorter dreamy lak ober whar de watermilions lay ’n de\r\ncol’ spring branch.\r\n\r\n“Dis wus my time to spring de s’prise ob de ebenin’ on ’em, dat I’d\r\nfixed up. An’ so I riz up wid de most sancterfied look on I c’uld git,\r\none ob dem onworthy, miserbul-sinner sorter looks dat we elders allers\r\ncarry aroun’ in our coat pockets along with our bandanna handkerchiefs\r\nfur enny emergency, an’ I sez: ‘Brudders an’ sistrin, befo’ we listen\r\nto de soulful sermon in store fur our spiritual natures, which Br’er\r\nJohnsing gwineter gib us in his ellerquent way, I’ve sprung a letle\r\ns’prise on you, an’ I wants you all to retire wid me an’ refresh de\r\ninnard man a leetle. Brudderin’ knowin’ my onworthiness an’ de many\r\nobligashuns I am under to dis enlightened community ob Christian saints\r\nan’ godly men an’ wimmen, I’ve made two bar’ls ob ice-cold lemmernade,\r\nan’ you’ll find ’em asettin’, es a big s’prise,’ sez I, ‘on de houn’s\r\nob my ox-waggin, in de cool shade by de spring, wid plenty ob tin\r\ndippers fur all. We’ll now adjourn twenty minnits fur refreshments.’\r\n\r\n“Wal, suh, you sh’uld a heurd de shout. Ef de ’lection bed cum’ off\r\nden, I’d a got eb’ry vote in de deestrick an’ a fair sprinklin’ ob sum’\r\nin all de yudders. I went wid ’em an’ drunk, too. An’ we all drunk ter\r\none ernudder’s health. I drunk to Sister Ca’line, an’ Br’er Johnsing he\r\ndrunk to Dinah, an’ de leetle niggers drunk, an’ de ole niggers drunk,\r\nde gals an’ de boys. I hilt up my dipper an’ laugh, an’ sed to Br’er\r\nJohnsing, ‘Br’er Johnsing, here’s to you,’ sez I, ‘an’ all dat goes up\r\nmust go down.’ An’ wid dat I swallered down.\r\n\r\n“Den Br’er Johnsing--he’s mighty funny--an’ he hilt up his’n and laugh,\r\nan’ say: ‘Br’er Washington, here’s to you,’ sez he, ‘an’ all dat goes\r\ndown nurver comes up ergin.’ An’ den we all laugh.\r\n\r\n“But dat wus one time he wus terribly mistaken, es you will see.\r\n\r\n“Wal, suh, when we all hed drunk enough we went back to hear de\r\nwatermilion sermon, an’ den eat de fruit ob whut we heurd. ’Tain’t\r\neb’ry man kin say dat, boss, dat he eats de fruit ob whut he hears;\r\ndigests de fustly, an’ de secondly, an’ de thudly, assimmerlates\r\nin de juicy rime ob de tangerbul thing, de logical konclushun ob\r\nde intelectual fac’. An’ darfore I’ve allers sed dat drawin’ yo’\r\nkonclushuns frum de heart ob a watermilion makes de bes’ sermon in de\r\nwurl’.\r\n\r\n“I b’leeve I tole you, boss, dat dat lemmernade wus intended fur a\r\ns’prise fur ’em, didn’t I?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I believe you mentioned that it was a little surprise of yours in\r\nstore for them.”\r\n\r\nThe old man groaned. “Boss, fur heaben’s sake, annudder drap outen dat\r\nbottle! I’ll hafter brace up erg’in to tell de sorrowin’ scene dat\r\nfollers. Thankee, thankee! I’m better now, an’ maybe I kin finish, fur\r\ndat lemmernade turned out to be de bigges’ an’ sorrerfullest surprise\r\ndat ever come down a pike.\r\n\r\n“Br’er Johnsing tuck fur his tex’ de sermon ob Noah an’ de ark,\r\nan’ whilst Noah wus de man menshuned, hit wus plain dat I was de\r\napplercashun. He went on to show dat I wus a godly man, jes’ lak’ ole\r\nNoah, an’ dat I wus to de community ob Big Sandy whut Noah was to\r\nJeerruselum. He wus makin’ it short, but a-gwine in two-minnit time,\r\na-pacin’ lak’ ole Joe Patchen at a matternee fur a silver cup an’\r\nwreath ob roses, an’ den all at onct he lifted up his voice an’ sed:\r\n‘Yes, brudderin, de waters ob de g-r-e-a-t deep riz up, an’ de bottom\r\ndrop outen de clouds; de w-i-n-d-e-r-s ob heaben wus flung open, an’\r\nde upheaval ob de u-n-e-v-e-r-s-e begun----’\r\n\r\n“Dat wus es fur es he got, befo’ de word upheaval wus outen his mouth,\r\nsho’ ’nuff, de upheaval did begun. I seed ’im stop so suddenly he\r\nkicked up behind, clap his hands on his stummick an’ try to bolt fur a\r\nlocus’ thicket, but he c’uldn’t--he jes’ turned a complete summerset,\r\nathrowin’ up his immortal soul es he turned. Den I heurd a turrible\r\ncommoshun in de congregashun, an’ I look erroun’, an’ eb’ry nigger dar\r\nwus in de same fix es Br’er Johnsing. Dey wus whoopin’, an’ barkin’,\r\nand layin’ out in eb’ry kinder way, an’ all on ’em bent on de same\r\nthing. An’ whut dey wus doin’ to dat groun’ wus a-plenty! Dey thought\r\ndey was pizened an’ wus gwineter die, an’ den sech s’archin’ prayers\r\nes went up to de throne ob grace, mixed in wid moans, an’ groans, an’\r\nice-cold lemmernade dat seem to think hit wus time ter rise erg’in and\r\nfetch eb’rything else frum de grabe along wid it. By dis time I wus so\r\n’stounded I didn’t kno’ whut ter do. I look erroun’ an’ I seed dat me\r\nan’ ole Aunt Fat Ferreby wus de onlies’ ones dat wa’n’t tryin’ to turn\r\ninside out. She wus lookin’ mighty ashy erroun’ de gills, but she brace\r\nhers’f up an’ started out ter raise dat good ole hymn:\r\n\r\n  ‘How firm a foundation’--\r\n\r\nBut she hadn’t more’n got to ‘foundahun’ befo, her foundation was\r\nshaken, I seed her gag an’ double up an’ start in on:\r\n\r\n  ‘My risin’ soul leaps up to sing,\r\n    A song of praise ter day.’\r\n\r\n“’Bount dat time I felt a ’tickler kinder mizzry in my own innards,\r\nan’ de nex’ thing I disremember I had Sister Ferreby ’round’ de neck\r\nan’ we wus singin’ dat hymn tergedder. Lor’! hit wus awful. I’ve seed\r\nmenny a sight, but I nurver expect erg’in ter see three hundred an’\r\nsixty-five niggers throwin’ up at de same time. When sum’ on ’em got\r\ndey secon’ wind dey wanted to lynch me, but by de time dey got erroun’\r\nto me wid a rope dey ’cided I wus too nigh dead to need killin’, and by\r\ndis time dey all had to ’zamperfly de truth ob de biblical sayin’ about\r\nde dog an’ de thing he would go back to. By dis time eb’ry doctor in de\r\ncountry wus dar, fetchin’ all de querrintine offercers, an’ pest-tents,\r\nan’ disenfec-tents, an’ preparin’ fer c’olera an’ fever. An’ den we\r\nfoun’ out what ailed us.”\r\n\r\n“In the name of heaven, what was it?” I asked eagerly.\r\n\r\nThe tears rolled down the old man’s cheeks as he feebly begged for\r\nanother drop to enable him to finish his tale. Then he said:\r\n\r\n“Ain’t I dun tole you hundreds ob times it am de leetle mistakes we\r\nmake in life dat turns de tide? Ain’t I? Wal, dat’s whut ruined me\r\ndat day, an’ terday I am a man widout offis an’ widout honor in my\r\nole age. Dat mornin’, ’stead ob gwine down to de sto’ myse’f to get\r\nde poun’ ob tartar acid ter make up dat lemmernade wid, I saunt dat\r\ntrifflin’ Jim Crow gran’son ob mine, an’ he got de names twisted, an’\r\n’stead ob fetchin’ me back tartar acid, he fotcht me back a poun’ ob\r\ntartar emetic, an’ I didn’t do a thing but make up dat lemmernade wid\r\nit!”\r\n\r\n“But, surely, they wouldn’t treasure up such a mistake against you,\r\nseeing that you suffered with the rest,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Boss,” said the old man, rising, “how long you gwine ter lib wid\r\nniggers, an’ den hafter be tole ober an’ ober ergin de same thing? In\r\ncourse, dey didn’t beat me fur offis on ercount ob dat fool mistake,\r\nbut jes’ lemme ax you, whar is de nigger libin’ dat gwinter vote fur\r\nenny man dat’d lay out a hundred watermilions in de spring branch, let\r\n’em look at ’em an hour, an’ den turn dat nigger’s stummick into a\r\ngreen-persimmon fur a week?

It looked to the fireman of\r\n496 that the old engine was sticking her nose into the red dawn as\r\nshe plowed ahead hauling her fast freight South on schedule time. Tim\r\nDoogan was at the throttle--an old engineer who stood at the head of\r\nthe road’s list; for Tim had been in service longer than any of them,\r\nhad never failed in his duty and for twenty years had never taken a day\r\noff except one--to bury his wife.\r\n\r\nHe had never even asked for a promotion, and when it had been\r\noffered--the highest post of the engineer--Tim shook his head and\r\ndeclined.\r\n\r\n“I guess I’m used to this old route and I’d feel lost if I didn’t pass\r\nthrough the Little Town every few days.”\r\n\r\nThey were now approaching the Little Town, and Tim had not spoken\r\nsince he left the city, a hundred miles back. He was naturally quiet,\r\nbut the fireman had never known him to make the run before and not\r\nsay something. Something told the fireman that Tim had struck sadness\r\nsomewhere, and so at intervals he fired up but said nothing to the big,\r\nbegrimed man in overalls and cap who stood silently at his post, with\r\none hand always on the throttle of his engine.\r\n\r\n“I’m goin’ to stop twenty minutes in the Little Town, Jim,” said Tim\r\nas they began to pull into the station.\r\n\r\n“Any orders?” asked Jim, surprised.\r\n\r\n“No, but it’s my orders--ever’ Easter--been doin’ it for twenty years.\r\nCompany don’t like it, kin lump it,” Tim added dry.\r\n\r\nThis was Jim’s first year, and he had never heard.\r\n\r\n“No. 3 may be late an’ give me the chance. If she don’t, why, we stops\r\nanyway, Jim.”\r\n\r\n“Why, I’d rather she’d be on time, so we can go on. Don’t you want to\r\ngo on?” asked Jim.\r\n\r\n“Not for twenty minutes, ef I can he’p it. Fact is, we’re goin’ to stop\r\nhere a little while anyway.”\r\n\r\nThe fireman said nothing, and Tim slowed up No. 496 in the yard. Then\r\nhe jumped down and went in to report.\r\n\r\n“No. 3 twenty minutes late,” he said, as he came back. “Take keer o’\r\nthings till I git back. I’ll not be gone long.”\r\n\r\n“You ain’t that there thirsty for a drink this mornin’ are you, Tim?\r\nYou don’t drink to speak of, and I never knowed you to leave old 496\r\nbefo’.”\r\n\r\nTim said nothing, but climbed up and opened his big box. The fireman\r\nsmelt something sweet, and very tenderly Tim took out a longer\r\npasteboard box.\r\n\r\n“Flowers,” said the fireman. “Say, Tim, old man,” he laughed, “I’ve\r\ncaught on--it’s a gal.”\r\n\r\n“She _was_ a gal,” said Tim, quietly, “and the pretties’ and sweetes’\r\none that ever hit the soil o’ this wurl. An’ the little boy wa’nt no\r\nfluke.” He brushed at his eyes as he spoke, and left another grimy\r\nsmear there.\r\n\r\n“I’m a-goin’ over to the little cemetery a bit, Jim--yes, you stay with\r\n496. They’re buried over there. We lived--her an’ the little ’un--we\r\nlived here after we was married. She was allers sweet on Easter, and\r\nfor flowers and sech, an’ I love to do this for her an’ the boy. Been\r\ndoin’ it twenty year’. We don’t know nothin’, an’ maybe it’s all\r\nso--an’ if anybody’ll rise again it’ll be her--with her faith--for I\r\ntell you, Jim it was as a little child. Yes, they was both my children.”\r\n\r\nHe was taking the flowers out, lilies and roses and carnations and\r\ncultivated violets, big and blue and beautiful. In his big, grimy,\r\nblack hands, and amid the soot and dust of 496 they lay beautified and\r\nglorified, and the sweet odor went through the rough fireman until he\r\nsaw pictures of a far-away home.\r\n\r\nSilently Tim trudged across the hill to the little cemetery. The\r\nvillage was asleep, the unkept streets empty, the cold, gray mist hung\r\nlow over everything, and finally Tim disappeared in it. But twenty\r\nminutes later, when the sun had risen and 496 was butting through the\r\ngray, her throttles open, the smoke belching from her stack, Tim stood\r\nat his post, a smile lighting up his grimy face, his eyes fixed on two\r\ngraves amid pines, far up on the hill upon which shone lilies and\r\nroses and violets.\r\n\r\nThey thundered past, and the old engineer took off his cap and, turning\r\nto the fireman, said, above the roar of wheels and steam:\r\n\r\n“She used to say it this-a-way, Jim--I’ve heard her so often, an’ fer\r\nfive years she taught it to the little boy befo’ he left.” He looked\r\ntoward the sun rising through the mist, and said slowly:\r\n\r\n“_In the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn, toward the first\r\nday of the week came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the\r\nsepulchre._\r\n\r\n“_And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord\r\ndescended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door\r\nand sat upon it.... And the angel answered and said unto the woman,\r\nFear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus that was crucified. He is\r\nnot here for He is risen._”\r\n\r\nHe shut off steam as he pitched down a steep grade, and then Jim heard\r\nhim say:\r\n\r\n“That’s the way she said it, an’ we don’t know nothin’, Jim, nothin’.\r\nBut we do know that stranger things is happenin’ ever’ day than jes’\r\nthe spirit livin’ agin. What’s light? What’s heat? What’s love? What’s\r\nthat wireless talkin’ through the air but things to tell us how little\r\nwe know, how small our minds is an’ how easy it ’ud be to be true, an’\r\nwe not know how to explain it with our little standards.”\r\n\r\nHe threw a kiss at the vanishing hill of pines. “No, I’ll keep on\r\nsayin’ it as she sed it, anyway, true or not: ‘I am the resurrection\r\nan’ the life.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nHO! EVERY ONE THAT THIRSTETH!\r\n\r\nThe corn crop up in the Bigbyville neighborhood is clean, the cotton\r\nshows not a spear of grass. The potato field looks as clean and green\r\nas a billiard cushion floor and the darkies are still, still hoeing.\r\nAll this was caused by a sermon old Wash preached there on foot-washing\r\nday last month, a literal extract of which I got from the old man\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n“Brudderin’ an’ Sisterin’--You’ll find my text in de six chapter of\r\nNoah’s pistols to de Gentiles. _Ho! every one dat thirsteth! Ho!_\r\n\r\n“De commandments we get from de Bible am beyond de scrutiny of man, an’\r\nwe natchurly think dat when a man gets hot an’ thirsty de thing fur\r\nhim to do is to hunt de spring branch an’ quench his burnin’ lips. But\r\nnot so. Here it is sot down in black an’ white in de book ob books,\r\ndat when you git thirsty, _jes’ keep on hoein’. Ho! every one dat\r\nthirsteth! Ho!_ And dat is right; de Bible is allers right. Hoein’ is\r\ngood fur de limbs, good fur de wind, good fur de crap, an’ good fur de\r\nsoul. De sun am hot now, but de wind’ll be cold agin. De rays pour down\r\nnow, but de sleet’ll come bye an’ bye. Dese am de rays of drought an’\r\nthirst, but ef you want to set back when de rains come, smoke yo’ pipe\r\nan’ sing dat song--\r\n\r\n  “Bile dat cabbage down\r\n  For it ain’t gwine to rain no mo’--\r\n\r\njes’ take off yo’ coat, shed yo’ shirt, an’ foller de corn an’ tater\r\nrow, an’ ef you git thirsty don’t stop to drink, but jes’ keep on\r\na-hoein’!\r\n\r\n“_Ho! everyone dat thirsteth! ho!_\r\n\r\n“An’ ain’t dat de law an’ de sense? Whut you wanter stop an’ drink fur?\r\nWon’t you jes’ get thirty agin? Keep on a-hoein’!\r\n\r\n“What did old Noah do when de windows ob de heabens was opened an’ de\r\nflood ob de great deep began to kiver de earth, an’ de fools got round\r\nhim an’ laughed an’ ax him whut he buildin’ dat ole ark for? He was\r\ntired, an’ thirsty, an’ hot, but he kep’ on a-hoein’, for he knowed\r\nhe’d get water enough bye and bye. _Ho! every one dat thirsteth! ho!_\r\n\r\n“What did Abraham do when dey got roun’ him an’ tried to stop him from\r\ngwine to de Promis’ Lan’? He kept on a hoein’ for Jordan.\r\n\r\n“Don’t let de flesh ob dis wurl’ fool you. Things ain’t whut dey\r\nseem. Water looks mighty good, specially to Baptists, but whut we\r\nMeferdists want to do is to keep on a hoein’. De wicked of Noah’s\r\nday didn’t hoe any. Didn’t dey git water enough? De Egyptians didn’t\r\nhoe enny, but follered de Israelites into de Red Sea. Didn’t dey get\r\nwater enough? Ole Jonah didn’t obey de Lord an’ hoe to de mark, an’ de\r\nwater swallowed him fust an’ de whale swallered ’im next. Let dat be a\r\nwarnin’ to you to stick to de tex’ of de Bible an’ de doctrine of de\r\nchurch, an’ when you get thirsty keep on a-hoein’. It’s hard now, but\r\nit’ll be sweet bye and bye. It’s hot now, but it’ll be cold bye and\r\nbye. You git mighty thirsty an’ you think de taters ain’t never goin’\r\nto come, but when de winter rains come, an’ de winds blow, an’ you sot\r\ndown round de big fiah wid de sweet brown ’possum an’ dem taters, you\r\nwork so hard fur to get in de heat, an’ sweat, an’ thirst ob summer,\r\nden will de heart ob de faithful be glad, den will you shout an’ sing:\r\n\r\n  “Ho! every one that thirsteth, ho!”\r\n\r\nThis last appeal was too much. The congregation arose in a body at the\r\nwords ’possum and potatoes and went off to hoe, leaving the old man\r\nwith no one to pass around the hat.\r\n\r\n\r\nA RACE FOR LIFE.\r\n\r\nI saw a race--a race for life, too--that interested me the other day\r\nmore than any that I have seen this year. It occurred in mid-air, in\r\na kingdom not our own; but the fresh air was sweet where the race for\r\nlife went on, and the fields were green beneath, and the brooks purled\r\nbelow and the sun shone gloriously over all, and to the poor creature\r\nwho raced for his life I doubt not but he took it all in and life was\r\nas sweet to him as it is to us.\r\n\r\nIt was a golden-winged butterfly, one of those beautiful creatures\r\nthat is more of heaven than of earth, more of the blossom than of the\r\nbrown heath, and it seemed cruel to me that this beautiful thing,\r\nthrown off from the film of a rainbow and made with an organism so\r\nspiritual that it lives on the nectar of flowers, dwells on the bosom\r\nof a nodding lily and floats on the breath of a zephyr, must come under\r\nthe great selfish law of life and be forced to fight for its brief but\r\nbeautiful existence. Man must fight, we know--and all history, if it\r\nlie not, is but a chronicle of battle, blood and death, in which the\r\nsurvival of the fittest and the achievements of human destiny have been\r\ngauged by the brains that were behind gunpowder, and the courage that\r\ncomes of God. Man, beasts, birds, reptiles, fishes--it is a survival\r\nmerely--and “nature, red in tooth and claw,” has been demonstrated to\r\nbe more merciful than nature rotting in the decrepitude of age. But, O,\r\nthat this ethereal thing--half rainbow and rose, half light and lily\r\nblossom, half child and cherubim--might have been spared!\r\n\r\nAnd who were its enemies--two glorious mocking birds, that had sung\r\nlike spirits from an angel choir around my home all spring and\r\nsummer--that had reared their young in contentment and happiness and\r\nshould have had nothing against any of God’s creatures, whose life had\r\nbeen a poem, whose breath a summer song--alas, that these should have\r\nbeen its murderers! It almost makes me despair of the ethics of life. I\r\nfeel like saying to man: “Go, murder your fellow men--it is nature. Go,\r\nrob, steal and plunder--it is law.”\r\n\r\nAnd is it not law? In spite of the ethics of religion and dictates\r\nof equity, is it not at last a question of one getting and the other\r\ngiving--of money, love--ay, even life?\r\n\r\nGolden Wings was in my garden and he was content until that which\r\nsustained his life gave out--food. He had sucked every flower--he\r\nmust go to pastures new. The distance to my neighbor’s garden was\r\nsome two hundred yards, and there was nothing but air between us.\r\nHe thought of it a long time--he hovered from flower to flower and\r\nthought--of his mate, of life, of death. Had he been all spirit he\r\nhad stayed forever among the flowers. He had run no chance of death.\r\nBut he was half spirit and half life and that life was rebelling\r\nand begging for food. He must go. It was life or death. He rose\r\nreluctantly--frightened--straight up--every sense awake--every nerve\r\nkeyed--every eye on the lookout for an enemy--the spirit which had\r\nnever harmed even a flower, and which should have had no enemy. Up,\r\nstraight up, he arose--quivering, scared, frightened--then winged his\r\nway across the blue ether in a flight, as it proved, for its life.\r\n\r\nThe mocking-bird is a fly catcher, but not an expert one. Compared\r\nwith the swallow, the marten, the crested fly-catcher, the expert king\r\nbird, the wood pewee, and Phoebe, he is a poor imitation. But the\r\nmocking-bird is a poet, and everything is grist that comes to a poet’s\r\nmill--from the grasshopper on the ground to the butterfly in the air.\r\n\r\nThe male bird saw Golden Wings first and gave him the first heat for\r\nhis life. Up in the air he darted, circled and swooped. Poor Golden\r\nWings fled, turned, ducked, dived--and escaped. The poet dropped to\r\nhis twig in disgust, and his mate took up the race. Golden Wings saw\r\nher coming and his heart bursted with fear. He fairly quivered in the\r\nair. He knew not which way to turn. She darted, and all but caught\r\nhim. For a moment, in mid-air, I saw them whirling and twisting and\r\ntumbling--poor Golden Wings panting and fluttering for a chance once\r\nmore for home and life, and the poetess for a morsel to eat. It ended\r\nin the butterfly getting above the bird--which seemed always its\r\ntactics--while the latter dropped down in disgust to her mate. Then\r\nthey both started after poor Golden Wings, and it looked as if his time\r\nhad come. But all the time he had been heading straight for the thick\r\ntrees beyond, where rested, perhaps, his distressed mate, waiting for\r\nhis return.\r\n\r\nIt was a terrible chase the two poets gave him--the tumbling, darting,\r\ncircling of the birds in fiendish delight, in maddened earnestness.\r\nTheir very wings were often so close that they fanned him about until\r\nhe looked like a speck of gold tissue paper hurled about by contrary\r\nwinds. Twice they got above him, dropped on him and--missed. Twice I\r\nlost him altogether, and, except that I saw the birds fluttering and\r\ndarting in the air, I had thought he was lost. When I saw him again\r\nhe had gotten above his enemies and was safely pursuing his zig-zag,\r\nfrightened, graceless, paper-fluttering flight for the trees and life.\r\n\r\n“Success to you, O, Golden Wings,” I said, “for already have you taught\r\nme a lesson in life. Let us keep above our enemies, if we would be\r\nsafe--not beneath them, for there we are a prey to their dirty talons;\r\nnot on their level, for then we are no better than they; but above\r\nthem where they cannot reach us and where we may go on to our destiny\r\nwith only the sunlight around us and the stars above us.”\r\n\r\nThe birds dropped down, baffled, to rest in the top of a sugar maple.\r\nThey had evidently lost their tempers, and, between panting and hard\r\nbreathing, I could hear them quarreling: “It was you,” said the\r\nwife--“you conceited thing--all your fault. I had him once if you had\r\nlet me alone.”\r\n\r\n“O, you had him, you did--‘over the left.’ If your talents equaled\r\nyour tongue we’d be better off.” They screeched and shuffled about and\r\nalmost spat at each other. They were beaten, chagrined and mad, and\r\nthey took it out on each other.\r\n\r\nAnd if you want to see the refinement of ill-temper, stir up two poets!\r\n\r\nGolden Wings was safe. He was high in the air, his very flight was now\r\nthe flight of victory, his poise the poise of one who had won. Twenty\r\nyards more he would drop down into the green trees where his mate,\r\nperhaps, awaited him, and be safe.\r\n\r\nI was about to hurrah with delight, when I saw a lightning bolt of red\r\nand white drop from the jagged bark of the dead limb of a towering oak\r\nin the midst of the forest and high above poor, weary, fluttering yet\r\nhappy Golden Wings. I paled at the thought, for I knew no butterfly\r\never escaped him. Even Golden Wings recognized his doom and, paralyzed\r\nwith fear, stopped his flight in mid-air and, in a few yards of his\r\ngoal, and lay floating in the air in hopeless fear. And well he might,\r\nfor the red and white bolt was the red-headed woodpecker, not generally\r\nknown to be a fly-catcher, but an expert in it, nevertheless. Often had\r\nI seen him poise above a luckless moth, drop like a plummet, and no\r\nmoth would be there. I despised him as a marauder, besides, for only\r\nyesterday I’d seen him pounce on a helpless young humming-bird and rend\r\nit as if it had been a worm.\r\n\r\nStraight at poor Golden Wings he came. The race was up.\r\n\r\nHe performed his old tactics, darted above the butterfly, some two\r\nyards higher in the air, gauged instinctively a plummet line from the\r\npoint of his own beak to Golden Wings and then drops with folded wings\r\nlike a ball of lead.\r\n\r\nI forgot to say that I was out that morning with the twelve-gauge,\r\nsmokeless shells and one and a half ounces of No. 7 chilled, thinking I\r\nmight see a certain thieving crow that I had a grudge against.\r\n\r\nThoughts are lightning--words thunder, and when I caught the first\r\nglimpse of the red-headed marauder of the air all this went through my\r\nmind: “Nature is nature--tooth and claw. And yet there is a God who\r\nsays even when a butterfly shall fall. He makes our lives and marks out\r\nour destiny. Sometimes amid injustice He calls Himself Retribution, and\r\nthen He has been known to raise up a man and a gun, invent smokeless\r\npowder and deadly chilled shot, give accuracy of aim and, most\r\nwonderful of all, the voice of a purpose to say that harm shall not\r\nhappen even to a butterfly.”\r\n\r\nThere was no smoke from the report and so I distinctly saw Golden Wings\r\ndrop joyfully among the green leaves. But a red-headed marauder lies in\r\nthe field where he fell.\r\n\r\nAnd if some one who knows, will tell me why I happened to be there, why\r\nI carried my gun that morning, why I fired, I will tell him who God is.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS CHANCE.\r\n\r\nThe summer day was nearly gone, and only a few clouds caught the gleam\r\nof sunset in the west. A woman of thirty, with a sweet, sincere face,\r\ncame out of a cottage and walked to the little farm gate that opened\r\non the main road winding across the Iowa prairie. The cottage sat in a\r\nsmall grove of trees, and farther off were neat outhouses, a stable and\r\ndairy. Flowers bloomed in a little bed near the front gate, and several\r\nhives of bees sat under cherry trees in the front yard. Everything\r\naround the neat cottage, from the well-kept vines which climbed over\r\nthe porch to the orchard and fields of corn, clearly showed that Thrift\r\nand Industry were the handmaidens that lived there.\r\n\r\nThe woman was not pretty, neither was she handsome, but her face was\r\nof unusual intelligence and strength. Her hands showed work, and a few\r\ngray hairs shone over her temple.\r\n\r\nAt the little gate she stood while the shadows grew darker around\r\nher. There were chirpings of summer insects, and presently down the\r\nwalk stalked a huge St. Bernard, looking like a great bear in the\r\ntwilight. He seemed to think the woman had been out alone long enough,\r\nand his very way of walking showed that he knew he was her protector.\r\nHe stalked up and thrust his big cold nose into her hand as it hung\r\nlistlessly by her side. She started, but closed it over his mouth with\r\na caress, saying:\r\n\r\n“Rex, you are silly about me.”\r\n\r\nA buggy came out of the gloaming down the road, and stopped at her\r\ngate. The woman turned pale in the twilight, as she recognized\r\nthe middle-aged man who came toward her, holding out his hand:\r\n“Jennie--I--well--it’s me!”\r\n\r\nHe would have opened the gate, but the dog growled savagely, and she\r\nhooked the latch hastily, as she said:\r\n\r\n“Ralph--why--why--I thought--but don’t try to come in--Rex--I could not\r\ncontrol him.”\r\n\r\nShe was so agitated she could not speak further. Her knees shook, and\r\nshe clung to the gate, half leaning.\r\n\r\n“I have been back a week,” he said slowly. “You haven’t changed much,”\r\nhe added, eyeing her closely while she flushed under his gaze. “I never\r\nexpected to see you again.”\r\n\r\n“No--no--don’t try to come in--Rex--Rex!”\r\n\r\nThe great dog had rushed at the gate as the man tried to open it again,\r\nand she held her hand on the latch.\r\n\r\n“He don’t seem to know your friends from your enemies,” said the man\r\nwith a cynical laugh.\r\n\r\n“I think he does,” she said quietly, “better than I have ever known\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at her quickly. Then he tried to laugh.\r\n\r\n“Why--Jennie--you know I haven’t seen you in so long.”\r\n\r\n“I never expected to see you again. I was not looking for you now,” she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“I never thought I’d ever come back, but the Klondike--well, a man pays\r\ntwo dollars for every dollar’s worth of gold he finds there.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me about yourself,” she said, still leaning on the gate, one knee\r\nresting on the lower plank for support.\r\n\r\n“Well, Jennie, after we had our little quarrel and you broke off with\r\nme--”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken,” she said quietly. “You left, Hugh, without a\r\nword--without telling me good-bye. There was nothing left to do but to\r\nsend you your ring.”\r\n\r\n“We won’t quarrel again, now, Jennie. I have come back to you to tell\r\nyou--”\r\n\r\nShe had been looking closely in his face, and her heart beat wildly.\r\nShe had seen it all--the bravado way, the flushed recklessness, the\r\nsign everywhere of dissipation, of modesty gone, of truth, of the old\r\nmanhood.\r\n\r\n“Not that,” she said, quickly interrupting him, “but of yourself. Tell\r\nme where you have been and--and what doing.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed coldly.\r\n\r\n“Well, after we split up I went West, then to the Klondike. But it was\r\na nasty life. As I said, I have made nothing, and I hoped all the time\r\nto make a fortune and bring it back to you, Jennie.”\r\n\r\n“Was it true--that I heard--the trouble?”\r\n\r\n“Why, yes, I did get to drinking too much, and got into trouble--but\r\nthe papers had it overdrawn. I returned him his money. Now I have come\r\nback to you--to tell you I still--”\r\n\r\n“You need not tell it,” she said quickly. “You could tell nothing\r\nI would believe now. You are not the man you were before you left,\r\nand never will be. Then you were weak, but honest and sober. Now\r\nyou are weak, but dishonest and a drinker. And you must not come\r\nin--no--no--you are not the Hugh I once knew and loved.”\r\n\r\nShe sobbed in a quick way as she said it, but went on quietly:\r\n\r\n“After you left you know mother died, then father, and I was left\r\nalone. Our little farm--well, I’ve paid off the mortgage. It was hard\r\nwork, but the five years have passed so quickly. They always do when\r\none works for love. I changed the old-fashion farming ways. I planted\r\norchards and raised bees. I diversified my crops. I--well--” she\r\nlaughed hopefully for the first time--a laugh which brought a pang to\r\nhis heart, for it was the old laugh. “I am not yet started in that, for\r\nI am so enthusiastic a farmer and poultry raiser and stock woman that\r\nI’ll talk shop all night if you let me. Anyway, they say I keep posted\r\nand up with the times, and I have time, too, for good reading.\r\n\r\n“Hugh,” she said quickly, after awhile, “really I have thought of you\r\noften, but I will not deceive you. You have gone out of my life. I\r\nhave heard enough--before you came--heard it, seen enough. In all our\r\nlives, our romances I mean, it is imagination that counts more than\r\nthe reality. Common sense and farm work,” she said, “will cure it, and\r\nI--think--I know I am happier than if I were now married to you--to you\r\nas you are, Hugh,” she added more tenderly.\r\n\r\n“But--but, Jennie, I’ll change; give me a chance.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Hugh, that is what you had, and I mine. I have watched nature\r\nsince I’ve been a farmer, and I notice she never gives but one chance.\r\nThere are too many of her children that must have a chance.”\r\n\r\nHe turned with a rough laugh and oath and walked off.\r\n\r\n“I’ve come home jus’ to make a fool of myself,” she heard him say with\r\nanother oath.\r\n\r\nBut she did not pale even. She turned and walked in, the dog following\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“I am so glad I saw him anyway,” she said, patting the dog’s head.\r\n“Now, I can forget him so easily. Oh, Rex, life--life--how strange it\r\nis, but we all have one chance. Oh, I am so glad I had mine, and it has\r\ngiven me this sweet home and you. For it were better to love a dog that\r\nis honest and true than a man who it not.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUE JOHN.\r\n\r\nA Mississippi planter, and a gentleman of the old school, sends me\r\nthis one from a little town in the Delta:\r\n\r\n“My dear Trotwood, do you know what it is to get out of whisky\r\nChristmas morning in a little one-horse Mississippi town where you have\r\nto put a darkey on a mule and wait until he rides five miles through\r\nthe mud before you can get your Christmas toddy? Well, I hope you never\r\nmay, for that thing happened to me last Christmas.\r\n\r\n“The truth is, there was no need why we should have been out of the red\r\ningredient of Christmas jollity, for when we turned in the night before\r\nwe had a fine, big jug of it. But the Major was there, and the Colonel\r\nand the Doctor, and somehow, before we knew it, it was gone.\r\n\r\n“I am a bachelor, you know, on a big Mississippi cotton farm, and these\r\nwere my guests and we went to bed with our boots on. About daylight\r\nChristmas morning we all woke up with one impulse and an awful thirst.\r\n\r\n“The Doctor got to the jug first, and we heard him growl:\r\n\r\n“‘What infernal hog drank all this whisky last night?’\r\n\r\n“This stirred up the Colonel, and he sat up in bed and remarked, with\r\nhis usual emphasis:\r\n\r\n“‘That licker gone a’ready? Christmas mornin’, too?’\r\n\r\n“By this time we were all investigating it, and some of the talk\r\nindulged in concerning the man who did it ought to have made him feel\r\nanything but white.\r\n\r\n“By this time we would have given a dollar each for a drink. The\r\nnearest whisky was five miles away, where Ikey Rosenstein, a little\r\nMississippi Jew, kept a cross-roads grocery. It was raining, and cold,\r\ntoo, but there was nothing to do but to call Blue John and send him on\r\nold Kit, the pacing mule, for a new jug of it.\r\n\r\n“‘Blue John,’ I said, when he poked his head in the door, ‘you’ll find\r\nmy bridle and saddle hanging up in the carriage house. Saddle old Kit\r\nand take this jug up to old Ikey’s and bring it back full, p. d. q.’\r\n\r\n“‘Yassah, Boss.’\r\n\r\n“‘Blue John,’ yelled the Doctor, ‘don’t let old Kit throw off on us\r\nthis heat and we’ll give you first drink.’\r\n\r\n“‘Yassah, Boss.’\r\n\r\n“‘And, Blue John,’ said the Major, as he started off, ‘remember it’s\r\nChristmas, old man, and get about in a hurry. Here’s a quarter to help\r\nyou along,’ he said, tossing it across the bed.\r\n\r\n“‘Yassah, Boss, yassah.’\r\n\r\n“We all laid down again to wait for Blue John.\r\n\r\n“‘Boys,’ said the Colonel, after ten minutes of thirst, ‘I’ll bet I can\r\ntrace every step that old darkey takes. Let’s see, now: He’s got to the\r\nbarn door, hasn’t he? Now he has found the bridle and has caught old\r\nKit. Now the saddle goes on and he is mounting.\r\n\r\n“‘No, he ain’t quite up in the saddle yet,’ chimed in the Doctor. ‘He\r\nhas stopped to take a chew of twist tobacco and spit on his hands.’\r\n\r\n“‘That’s a fact, Doc, but he’s up now, isn’t he?’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes.’\r\n\r\n“‘Now he’s pacing down to the big gate. He’s opening it----’\r\n\r\n“‘No,’ put in again the Doctor, ‘he got down off of old Kit and opened\r\nit. Hang the old fool, but isn’t he a slow one?’\r\n\r\n“‘Well, he’s going up the road now, ain’t he?’ said the Colonel.\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, and he’s got to the big swamp. He’s creeping through it. Dad\r\ngast, but ain’t it muddy there? Gehew, but I am thirsty,’ broke in the\r\nDoctor.\r\n\r\n“Ten minutes later he added joyfully: ‘Well, he’s out of the swamp, and\r\nhe has spurred old Kit into a gallop, thinking of that drink. Oh, old\r\nBlue John is a good one!’\r\n\r\n“‘He’s at the three-mile post now,’ said the Major, twenty minutes\r\nlater. ‘Lord, but that old mule can hump when he tries!’\r\n\r\n“We all smiled in satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“‘Where is he now, Doc?’ said the Colonel, after it had seemed an hour\r\nof silence.\r\n\r\n“‘At old Ikey’s, boys. See, he’s handing old Ikey the jug. Now old Ikey\r\nis fillin’ it.’\r\n\r\n“‘From what barrel?’ asked the Major, excitedly.\r\n\r\n“‘Lincoln County, Tennessee.’\r\n\r\n“We all grunted our assent in chorus.\r\n\r\n“‘He’s started home now,’ went on the Colonel, ‘and the way that mule\r\ncan pace! Blue John is settin’ up in that saddle, holdin’ that jug\r\nunder one arm and a-larrupin’ old Kit every yard. Scott, but ain’t he\r\ncomin’!’\r\n\r\n“‘He’s got to the swamp again, Doc,’ said the Major, after twenty\r\nminutes had passed. ‘He’ll get here directly.’\r\n\r\n“‘Boys, he’s reached the big gate already. I hear him coming,’ said\r\nthe Colonel, excitedly.\r\n\r\n“Sure enough, we heard him. There was no mistake--Blue John was now\r\ncoming down the hall.\r\n\r\n“‘Open the door and let him in quick!’ said the Major, ‘By gum! but\r\nain’t he and that old mule a pair of buds?’\r\n\r\n“By this time we had all jumped out of bed and were hunting for\r\ntumblers and sugar. Blue John poked his head in the door.\r\n\r\n“‘Boss,’ said Blue John.\r\n\r\n“‘Come in, Blue John!’ cried the Major. ‘Fetch it right in. You’re a\r\ngood old man. Colonel, lend me your spoon a minute.’\r\n\r\n“‘Boss, whar--whar----’ stammered Blue John.\r\n\r\n“‘Come in, Blue John!’ cried the Doctor, ‘come right in.’”\r\n\r\n“‘_Boss, whar de debbil you say you put dat bridle in de kerridge\r\nhouse? I been huntin’ fur it fur er hour an’ I can’t find it ter sabe\r\nmy life._’”\r\n\r\n\r\nA DRUNKEN WOMAN.\r\n\r\nI saw in a neighboring city not long ago a drunken woman. She was in\r\na fashionable hotel and stood beside a post in the little gallery\r\nthat ran around the court. She was not three feet above our heads,\r\nwas dressed in the height of fashion, wore a hat that looked like a\r\nhuge poppy and altogether she was not unlike a beautiful tiger lily\r\nthat seemed about to fall over into our arms. Instantly that wave of\r\nromance and reverence as natural to man, when he sees beauty clothed\r\nin purity, as the tides that do follow the midnight moon, swept over\r\nme. Her form was faultless, her gown perfect, her face beautiful.\r\n\r\nAt least I thought so until I looked up and happened to catch her eye.\r\nShe smiled the sensual smile of a wood-nymph and leered as disgustingly\r\nas ever Bacchus through a glass of old Falerian. In a moment it all\r\nchanged. Her face was no longer beautiful, but hard and cruel. Her form\r\nwas made--her gown the gaudy thing of a demi-monde.\r\n\r\nI blushed when she singled me out and leered, and ducked my head, for\r\nfear someone had seen me. But I soon saw that she leered at all alike\r\nand knew no difference between a man and men.\r\n\r\nFor a half hour she stood there, scarce able to cling to the post she\r\nstood by, the observed of every man in the court, the disgusting moral\r\nthat pointed the old story of the fallen angel.\r\n\r\nIt is bad enough to see a drunken man. Nothing so quickly robs goodness\r\nof its sweetness, genius of its charm, greatness of its colossal form,\r\nthan to behold it drunk. There are some great men I know who, if I ever\r\nsaw them drunk, never again would I believe they were great. They say\r\nPoe was a drunkard. I cannot imagine it. And S. S. Prentiss--I cannot\r\nbelieve it. I cannot think of DeQuincy and Coleridge as opium eaters,\r\nByron and Burns as whisky-heads. If I did I could never again read\r\nanything they wrote. For of all things that levels man to the beasts\r\nand makes knowledge a strumpet and genius a bawdy, it is the maudlin\r\nrottenness of a plain old drunk.\r\n\r\nWhisky and not death is the greatest leveler with the dirt.\r\n\r\nBut to see a drunken woman--Good God! Nature is partial to a man. She\r\nhas made some laws for him she has not made for woman. She has filled\r\nhim with passion and strength and capacity for work and great things.\r\nShe overlooks it, perhaps, when he steps aside, under the burning law\r\nshe has forced on him for reproduction, and she sighs and smiles when\r\nhe drowns his strenuousness now and then in the forgetfulness of the\r\ncup. He may do all that, and if his wife be pure still may he sire sons\r\nwho will be brave and honest, and daughters who will be pure and noble.\r\n\r\nBut let the woman be weak and fall, and see how quickly nature revenges\r\nherself for the desecration of her unwritten law by throwing back on\r\nhumanity sons who are thieves and daughters who are impure. This is an\r\nunwritten law, but it proves that the mother is the great moral force\r\nof the world. Let her violate it and the punishment comes quickly on\r\nthe race.\r\n\r\nAs I looked at this woman I could not help thinking: “I hope, as one\r\nwho, interested in stock, is more interested in the human race, that\r\nyou carry in your life that penalty of impureness--barrenness. For it\r\nwere better for mankind that such as you should never be mothers, to\r\nfill prison pens with thieves and forgers and bawdy houses with painted\r\nMagdalenes. Indeed, it is up to you to pass off the stage of life and\r\ncease to encumber an earth on which not one single womanly law is left\r\nyou to fill. The honest matron of the noble horse brings forth yearly\r\nand within the sacred laws of nature an animal that is the pride of\r\nman and the glory of his kind. The gentle mother of the dairy is an\r\ninspiration and a blessing to the earth. The very brood sow of the pen\r\nsuckles her hungry brood begot in honorable wedlock. But you, O, being\r\nof a higher world, O breeder of immortal beings, made in the image of\r\nGod and endowed with the reason of the angels, you from whom nature\r\nexpects so much, you fall below all of these and brand yourself the\r\nharlot of humanity!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe want a good live agent in every town in the United States for\r\n“Trotwood’s Monthly.” Write for terms to agents.

The greatest living reinsman is Ed F. Geers, his breeder, joint\r\nowner, trainer and driver. The object of this sketch is to tell the\r\nstory of these two--the one a horse, the other a man. For when it is\r\nall sifted down at last, it will be found that there are many parallel\r\nlines between a great race horse and a great driver. Each to succeed\r\nmust possess certain qualities in common which make for success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ED GEERS The silent man from Tennessee.]\r\n\r\nAnd first, each must be born for greatness. This may seem strange to\r\nthe uninitiated, but no man knows the truth of it more than he who has\r\nspent his life in breeding great horses and in studying great men. It\r\nis pedigree that counts in man and horse, and by pedigree I do not\r\nmean blood lines only, though they count more in the life of the lower\r\nanimal, the horse, than in the life of the higher animal, the man.\r\nBlood lines alone will not carry a man through the battle of life and\r\nbring him out victor at the end. For there are two pedigrees in every\r\nman which count for greatness or weakness in him. One is the pedigree\r\nof his body, the other is the pedigree of his soul. With horse, the\r\npedigree of body counts most. With man, the soul. For it is that which\r\ncounts for honesty, for singleness of purpose, for truthfulness, for\r\nsilence, for thought, for right living, for that deathless spirit which\r\nnever says die. In victory, calm; in defeat, silent, but saying proudly:\r\n\r\n  “Out of the darkness which surrounds me,\r\n    Black as the pit from pole to pole,\r\n  I thank whatever gods there be\r\n    For my unconquerable soul.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for man--outside of the pygmies which some call kings--he\r\nkeeps no record of his pedigree. This is wrong, for man should at least\r\ntake as much interest in his own pedigree as he does in his horses’ or\r\nhis dogs’. And so, now and then, a master, in his craft, comes out of\r\nthe great mass of humanity, with no extended pedigree but the product\r\nof earnest and honest and strong God-fearing fathers and mothers\r\nof many, many centuries. The child may not know them but for one\r\ngeneration, but they are all there--there in his blood and his brain\r\nand his brawn.\r\n\r\nAnd so he is born honest and earnest and strong. Such is Ed Geers--a\r\nman who has come up from the common people. Common people of a century\r\nago, but O, how uncommon now in these days of trusts and steals and\r\ngrinding graft! In these days, when a millionaire is a poor man, these\r\ndays of the Equitable, these days of Rockefeller, these days of the\r\ncursed trusts and tariff and the unspeakable graft-days when man is\r\nnothing and money all. God of our fathers, give us back again the days\r\nof the honest common people!\r\n\r\nFrom such source comes Shakespeare, whose genius was also the product\r\nof honesty, of brawn, of rest. Shakespeare, who has written and left\r\nnothing else to be said! From such a source came James Knox, and Andrew\r\nJackson, and John Wesley, and Abraham Lincoln--these and every other\r\ngreat man whose silent statues now stand as the mile-posts of human\r\nprogress, each marking an era in the epoch of the thing God made him\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nAnd so, as I said, from such a source came Geers, the honest man\r\nand the master reinsman of his age. And so, as I said, counting\r\nthe recorded pedigree, Walter Direct has it over Geers, for man,\r\nwho foolishly lets his own pedigree slip, has been very careful in\r\npreserving that of his horse. Strange, isn’t it? And yet we are all\r\ndoing it. Ah, well, perhaps it is best for many of us that it is so.\r\nFor, as we say of the horse, in the fifth generation each one of us\r\nwould have to count for sixty-two fathers and mothers, landing us back\r\ntwo hundred years ago in Scotland and Ireland, and out of that number,\r\nin that age and country, fortunate is he who was not sent up for\r\npoaching, for cattle-lifting, for breaking heads and, perhaps--locks!\r\n\r\nWalter’s pedigree is blue-blooded. His owners, Chaffin & Gears, saw to\r\nthat. We can make our horse’s pedigree better than we can make our\r\nown--for that is made for us, and often, in the making, when two warm\r\nyoungsters fall in love and decide to marry, nothing but the grace of\r\nGod, or the breaking of a midnight ladder, has saved us.\r\n\r\nIn _The Horse Review_ of 1900, when Walter Direct was then a suckling\r\nat his mother’s heels, I wrote a description of him and predicted from\r\nhis blood lines that one day he would be the greatest of pacers. It\r\nsounds prophetic now, but I rise hastily to disclaim it. Any horseman\r\nposted in the pedigree and achievement of his sire and dam, and of all\r\nhis bluelines, would naturally have said the same thing. His sire,\r\nDirect Hal, was the greatest horse of his day. His name and career are\r\nhousehold words in horsedom and will not be extended in this article.\r\nBut later on, in “The History of the Hals,” now running as a serial in\r\nthis Monthly, a chapter will be devoted to him in its proper place. It\r\nis enough here to say that he was unbeaten and that his sire, Direct,\r\nbefore him, was the greatest pacing stallion of his day, and that\r\nbeyond that lies the great Director, Dictator and Hambletonian 10--an\r\nunbroken line of greatness--and in a horse greatness means gameness,\r\nsoundness, honesty, speed.\r\n\r\nIsn’t that enough to give us a tip on the breeding of boys and girls?\r\n\r\nWalter’s dam is a homely little mare called Ella Brown, with a record\r\nof 2:11-1/4, made in 1893, to high-wheel sulky. With the sulky of\r\nto-day it would have been 2:05. Never have I known a gamer, sweeter\r\nlittle mare than Ella Brown, and well do I remember when she first came\r\nout, and though suffering acutely, all through her racing career with\r\nnervicular disease of the foot, often so lame that she could scarcely\r\nscore down for the word, yet, when she was in the fight, and the\r\nclatter and hot breath of her competitors sounded the warning in her\r\nears, she would forget her lameness and her soreness and race like the\r\ngame little thing she was.\r\n\r\nAnd, like all other great mares, the pedigree of Ella Brown was no\r\naccident. She was sired by Prince Pulaski, Jr., and he by old Prince\r\nPulaski, the sire of the old queen, Mattie Hunter, 2:12-3/4. The dam\r\nof Ella Brown has only lately been correctly established. She was by\r\nEvans’ Joe Bowers, son of Joe Bowers 2:32, son of Traveler. Her second\r\ndam was by Tom Hal, sire of Brown Hal, and her third dam was said\r\nto be by Brooks, sire of Bonesetter 2:19. Every horseman knows what\r\nthese mean. Mated with Direct Hal, and hence doubled in strength and\r\ngreatness, and behold Walter Direct, champion green pacer of the year.\r\n\r\nThis is the pedigree of Edward Geers--this is the pedigree of Walter.\r\nBoth honest.\r\n\r\nGeers’ honesty is proverbial. His surname is “Honest Ed Geers, the\r\nSilent Man of Tennessee.” Did you ever notice how naturally greatness\r\nand silence go together? Let that greatest of all great men,\r\nShakespeare, tell it:\r\n\r\n  Silence oft of pure innocence\r\n  Persuades when speaking fails.\r\n\r\nThere are many stories told of the honesty of Ed Geers. It must be\r\nremembered that in the life he has led, the terrible, bruising,\r\nfighting battles of the turf, when fame and fortune often hang on the\r\nwire for which hundreds of others are driving as well as he, that he\r\nis often sorely and terribly tempted. Men are human at most, and in a\r\nfight for money, for fame, for the joy of victory, all combined in one\r\nrace, all the great stakes of life, is it a wonder that millionaire\r\nhorsemen have tried to buy him, that rich breeders have tried to bribe\r\nhim, greedy owners corner him and tricksters and knaves foul him? Think\r\nof twenty-five years of this and then coming out without a stain on his\r\nname, a breath of suspicion and the pseudonum of Honest Ed Geers--won,\r\ntoo, in the light of the fiercest conflict.\r\n\r\nWalter is game, so is Geers. In the many years in which the latter has\r\nbeen in the sulky he has met with accidents which, if they failed to\r\nbreak his neck, would have broken the heart of an ordinary man.\r\n\r\nAll horsemen will recall the bad accident he had with Searchlight and\r\nthe one that sent him to the hospital at Memphis a few years ago, with\r\na broken ankle. But a few weeks ago he was in a bad mix-up at Buffalo,\r\nwhen King Direct’s foot went into the sulky wheel of the contending\r\nhorse. The Nestor of the turf was unconscious when picked up, but\r\nquickly revived and dryly remarked, “Now, don’t make a hurrah of this\r\nthing and scare everybody to death for nothing.” That remark is an\r\nindex of his character. He hates a hurrah. The plumage of the peacock\r\nhas never become the pit game trimmed for the fight. He is loyal to\r\nhis friends, modest, quiet, honest, and with reverence for all that is\r\nsacred and good. He is one of the large men of his calling.\r\n\r\nThe training of Walter Direct has been in keeping with Mr. Geers’\r\ntheory that colts should be trained early but not hard. From the May\r\nnight when he was foaled in a terrific thunderstorm, so fierce that\r\nOld Wash, who acted as his midwife, was scarcely able to keep him from\r\ndrowning, until to-day, he has had the best of attention. His dam was\r\nfed grain during the nursing period, and Walter soon learned to eat it\r\nwith her. He was broken to halter as a weanling, and the next spring,\r\nNegley, the colored caretaker, broke him to harness, with occasional\r\njogs. The fall after he was a two-year-old he was sent to Memphis to\r\nGeers and given his first real lessons, and so trained each winter,\r\nwith joggings in the summer by Negley at Columbia. Mr. Geers’ rule is\r\nto keep them feeling good with a brush now and then for speed. He has\r\na horror of overworking colts. Indeed, his stable is never asked to go\r\nthe fast heats that many other owners delight in before being shipped\r\nto the races. He saves their speed and vital force for the time when\r\nit is needed most. In the spring when Walter was a three-year-old he\r\nwas asked to go a fast mile in 2:14, and was sent to Columbia to be\r\njogged and turned out. The next spring he paced his mile in 2:08-3/4,\r\nwhen he was sent back home again. On September 15, 1904 he was sent\r\nagain to Mr. Geers and to fame.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLORD ULLIN’S DAUGHTER.\r\n\r\n(Revised by Trotwood and brought up to date.)\r\n\r\n  A chieftain to the Highland bound\r\n    Would steal Lord Ullin’s daughter;\r\n  He bought a new machine in town--\r\n    A thing he hadn’t auto.\r\n\r\n  He sought the castle by the sea\r\n    And stopped behind the kitchen;\r\n  “This beats a pony bad,” said he,\r\n    “Because it don’t need hitchin’.”\r\n\r\n  He got the girl and started out\r\n    By pullin’ of a lever,\r\n  And then that auto turned about--\r\n    It was a gay deceiver.\r\n\r\n  It snorted, backed, went round and round,\r\n    Broke belly-band and breechin’,\r\n  Reared up and kicked--then, with a bound,\r\n    It started through the kitchen.\r\n\r\n  In there was Ullin fast asleep,\r\n    His stomach full of mutton;\r\n  That auto knocked him in a heap\r\n    It broke his only button.\r\n\r\n  “O, haste, thee--haste!” the Lady cries,\r\n    “Tho’ steams around me gather,\r\n  I’ll meet the ragings of the skies\r\n    But not a naked Father.”\r\n\r\n  “Aha--farewell--and now we’ll go,”\r\n    Said Laddy, smiling grimly;\r\n  He tried to head her for the door--\r\n    She started for the chimney.\r\n\r\n  “Come back--come back!” old Ullin cries,\r\n    “Not up there--that’s my larder;\r\n  You’ll ruin my meat and pies--\r\n    Come back an’ take my darter.”\r\n\r\n  By this the thing grew loud of pace,\r\n    Its waterworks were shrieking;\r\n  It started for the old staircase,\r\n    While Ullin was a-speaking.\r\n\r\n  It met Mrs. Ullin coming down--\r\n    She’d tucked the kids to cover;\r\n  She wore her night-cap and her gown--\r\n    She never wore another!\r\n\r\n  It buzzed amid the trundle beds,\r\n    Ran over lairds and lasses,\r\n  Went through the window, down the sheds,\r\n    And waked up all the asses.\r\n\r\n  It chased the hound-pups round the yard,\r\n    Ran over kairn and cattle;\r\n  The clans turned out with tunics barr’d,\r\n    And pibrocks, armed for battle.\r\n\r\n  The girl had fainted, sore dismayed,\r\n    Twice had it turned her over:\r\n  One lovely arm was stretched for aid,\r\n    And one was round her lover.\r\n\r\n  Up spake a hardy Highland wight--\r\n    (A rope was round him, ready):\r\n  “Just watch me rope her hind leg tight\r\n    And stop her, staunch and steady!”\r\n\r\n  He threw and caught her fast and fair,\r\n    It set their blood to fighting--\r\n  They saw him sailing through the air,\r\n    A tail he was--and kiting!\r\n\r\n  Now Ullin had a mother-in-law,\r\n    A saint she was from Zion;\r\n  Her lungs were rubber, cheeks were bra’,\r\n    Her body--well, SCRAP iron!\r\n\r\n  She waked and heard the dreadful din,\r\n    Ran down, the thing to worst it;\r\n  It struck her, knocked its inwards in,\r\n   It wheezed and groaned--and burst it!\r\n\r\n  They slew poor Laddy where he sat\r\n    With blunderbuss and bullit;\r\n  “’Tis not,” said Ullin, “’cause the brat\r\n    Was monkeyin’ with my pullit,\r\n\r\n  “But comin’ here in this vile car\r\n    To run off with my darter,\r\n  An’ not like neighbor Lochinvar,\r\n    On hoss-flesh, as he orter.”\r\n\r\n  --JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Humor is a great thing, but it has never yet won a battle, built a\r\ncity or bred a horse._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Meaning of Sorrow\r\n\r\n\r\nBY REV. W. D. CAPERS, RECTOR ST. PETER’S CHURCH, COLUMBIA, TENN.\r\n\r\n“Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now have I kept Thy word.”\r\n(Ps. 119: 67.)\r\n\r\nFrom one point of view there is no mystery so impenetrable as that\r\ninvolved in the suffering and sorrow which exists in every department\r\nand sphere of life. The suffering of humanity, the fact that “the world\r\ngroaneth and travaileth in pain until now” presented to the sensitive\r\nmind of Dr. John Hall the supreme difficulty with which he struggled\r\nduring a great part of his remarkable ministry, until courage, faith\r\nand experience taught him to understand and to recognize suffering\r\nas having its mission in life and in the development of character,\r\njust as happiness has its place, each acting as one of the two great\r\ninterpreters of moral and spiritual development. It is impossible to\r\nhave a creed or to form an adequate philosophy of life and overlook\r\nthe really essential and universal place suffering, in one form or\r\nanother, occupies therein. Just try and think, if you can, of a world\r\nin which there is no suffering, no sorrow, no pain; a world in which\r\nthere are no tears, no bitterness, no woe. The thing is unthinkable,\r\nit is simply inconceivable, and as a condition of life, utterly and\r\neternally impossible. Why? Because pleasure and pain are relative.\r\nSuffering and joy face each other in a blessed contrast. There has to\r\nbe a standard of comparison by which we are to make the proper estimate\r\nof these things, otherwise we would be unable to distinguish between\r\nthem; otherwise happiness would have no reality to it, no vitality\r\nin it, and neither strength nor power of growth, while life would be\r\nwithout an essential variety of emotions, and therefore necessarily\r\nbecome “stale, flat and unprofitable” indeed. A remarkable description\r\nof hell’s severest punishment, though very fanciful, is that, wherein\r\nthe victims are made to do that which they most loved to do here in\r\nthis life, incessantly, continuously and strenuously. The suggestion\r\nto my mind is very significant and teaches that the most tortuous and\r\nhorrible suffering is just that which comes through uninterrupted\r\nmonotony. To dance your life away, to drink your life away, to play and\r\nfritter your life away in purposeless amusement and never to suffer a\r\nreverse or be conscious of a struggle, never to know a pang of pain\r\nor experience a momentary disappointment, may seem to those who have\r\njust sipped an occasional drop from the cup of pleasure and mirth an\r\nenviable existence, a consummation in life devoutly to be wished. But\r\nto dance or play or laugh or sing through endless eons of time and to\r\nexperience not one inspiring struggle which brings moral and spiritual\r\nstrengthening, to have to live through eternity would be misery indeed.\r\nSuffering then, in the first place, heightens and intensifies our joys,\r\nit helps develop the power of enjoyment, and it makes a larger and a\r\nmore real happiness possible. To illustrate: There was unspeakable joy\r\nin the home of the prodigal, as the aged father rushed out to meet and\r\ngreet his wayward boy, for to the old man his son had been dead, and\r\nbehold he was alive again, he had been lost and was found. It was the\r\nsuffering of the separation which alone made possible the intense and\r\nglorified happiness of their reunion. And how often it happens that\r\nnot only are “troubled times praying times,” but that “man’s extremity\r\nis God’s opportunity.” Thus suffering often brings a man to his senses\r\nand makes him conscious of his dependence upon God. As we read, it was\r\nonly when the prodigal “came to himself” that he concluded to arise\r\nand go to his father, and we must conclude that it was the suffering,\r\nsorrow and bitterness of privation and disappointed hopes that drove\r\nhim to a realization of his true condition, and in the end brought\r\nto him a real and lasting happiness. In this and in similar acts of\r\nconduct history never fails to repeat itself in every age, in every\r\nepoch, in every generation, as well as yearly, daily and hourly in the\r\nlife of individuals and of nations. Opulence, ease, prosperity and an\r\nunwholesome peace have repeatedly rushed peoples and principalities to\r\na shameful and untimely ruin, wherein men have lost their reason and\r\nnations drunk with a sense of power have reeled and staggered to and\r\nfro like a drunken man and then lay prostrate in the dust. In support\r\nof this I appeal to history. In support of this Mr. Kipling appeals to\r\nhistory when in his recessional poem he said:\r\n\r\n  “Far called our navies melt away--\r\n    On dune and headland sinks the fire--\r\n  Lo, all our pomp of yesterday\r\n    Is one with Nineveh and Tyre.\r\n  Judge of the nations, spare us yet\r\n  Lest we forget--lest we forget.”\r\n\r\nSuffering then, often serves to give us a fuller, freer, wiser and\r\nwider view of life. It was only when through suffering that the\r\nprodigal “came to himself,” and when he received this self-revelation,\r\nthen he “arose and went to his father,” and in like manner when man\r\n“comes to himself” he goes to God. But mark you, self-revelation seldom\r\nif ever comes to one while sailing the seas of glory and sounding all\r\nthe depths and shoals of mere worldly splendor and prosperity. “Before\r\nI was afflicted I went astray, but now I have kept my word,” said\r\nthe Psalmist, and when Job came to himself through the trial of his\r\nfaith and patience, he ceased to question the ways of Providence, he\r\nreverently placed his hand upon his mouth and would “speak no further,”\r\nfor fear he now no longer knew God “by the hearing of the ear,” but by\r\nthe “seeing of the eye,” and he went to his knees in supplication, “and\r\nthe Lord turned the captivity of Job when he prayed for his friends.”\r\n\r\nAgain, we are to notice that suffering brings us courage and broadens\r\nand deepens and intensifies our sympathies. “Pity makes the whole world\r\nakin,” and so quickens our consciousness of brotherliness. “At sea when\r\nthe ship is in great peril the passengers crowd together, not because\r\nthey can escape peril by facing it in company, but because they can\r\ngain courage by companionship. The sense of human kinship grows fresh\r\nand keen when men stand together in the face of a common danger.” It\r\nis therefore through suffering that men gain courage through a vivid\r\nrealization of the brotherhood of man and the solidarity of the race.\r\nIt often is as Dr. Mabie has said: “Through sorrowful ways men have\r\nclimbed to the heights from which they now look into the heavens and\r\nover the landscape of life.”\r\n\r\nAnd this brings us to our final thought which is that suffering in some\r\nof its manifold forms gives that variety to life which is essential to\r\nthe proper development of all the faculties of heart, soul, mind and\r\nbody. By way of illustration, let us suppose that you could take from\r\nthe public and private libraries of the world every book that contained\r\na poem, a reference or a treatise touching the theme of sorrow, and\r\nwhat a dull, dead, gloomy monotony of uninspired literature would\r\nremain, while, in rather figurative language, the world itself could\r\nnot contain the books thus mutilated and cast away. Apply the same\r\ntest to art, and the galleries of the world would be destroyed, miles\r\nupon miles of bare walls would greet us at every turn as we made our\r\nheart-sick pilgrimage from gallery to gallery. Apply the same test to\r\nmusic, and you will never again hear the singing of a song with genius\r\nand power in it strong enough to stir the heart’s deepest emotions or\r\nto cause the soul to glow with a conscious ecstacy of faith and hope\r\nand the brain to burn with the fire of a high and holy resolution.\r\nThe organ’s rich peal, the ring of stringed instruments, the wailing\r\nof the lute would lose the voice of melody, while “The Marseillaise,”\r\n“The Star-Spangled Banner,” “Dixie Land” and similar martial airs would\r\nnever have found voice to speak for patriotic devotion or to chant the\r\nglory of a martyrdom for home or for country, had not the spirit of\r\nsacrifice and suffering pervaded them and given to them immortality.\r\n\r\nNo, suffering is a vital part and condition of life, and from the\r\nright use of it we gather strength and grow beautiful in moral and\r\nspiritual stature, while we gain the only happiness that maintains and\r\nhas power to bless mankind, happiness which is the child of conscious\r\nstrength acquired on the battlefield of conflict and in the vale of\r\ntears. How then are you going to use the sorrows, the afflictions, the\r\ndisappointments and the trials that must come inevitably into your\r\nlife? The late Maltby Babcock has a fine passage in this connection:\r\n“Byron eagerly coveted a place among the immortals, yet accepted\r\nhis club feet with cursings and bitterness; while St. Paul accepted\r\nhis ‘thorn in the flesh’ with sweetness and was thereby exalted and\r\ntransfigured. The poet wishes to become a hero for the public while\r\nprivately tasting of the sweets of profligacy. Sinning against his\r\nfiner feelings his art steadily declines, until at thirty-five it has\r\npassed into the sear and yellow leaf.” Let us strive to emulate the\r\nexample of St. Paul, and when having no power to expel from our life\r\nthat which brings pain and suffering, let us endeavor to accept such\r\nsorrow as an opportunity to develop character, and thereby be exalted\r\nand made strong, remembering always that since “The Man of Sorrows”\r\nhung upon the cross, transfigured sorrow is that which has blessed\r\nhumanity most, and brought men nearest to the heart and mind of the\r\nMaster. And train yourself to believe that.\r\n\r\n  “Sometime, when all life’s lessons have been learned,\r\n    And sun and stars forevermore have set,\r\n  The things which one weak judgment here has spurned,\r\n    The things o’er which we grieved, with lashes wet,\r\n  Will flash before us out of life’s dark night,\r\n    As stars shine best in deepest tints of blue;\r\n  And we shall see how all God’s plans were right,\r\n    And that which seemed reproof was love most true.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOUR STAR\r\n\r\n(In memory of Mrs. Annie Horne Fry, who died August 13, 1905.)\r\n\r\n  Sunset and Sorrow’s tide,\r\n      Over the bar--\r\n  Sunset, and daylight died\r\n      Seeing a Star.\r\n\r\n  Twilight, and Hope had fled,\r\n      Fled from afar.\r\n  Twilight, and Hope lay dead,\r\n      Holding a Star.\r\n\r\n  Midnight and mourning loud\r\n      Cometh to mar.\r\n  Midnight, yet o’er her shroud\r\n      Shineth the Star.\r\n\r\n  Morning, and from the mist--\r\n      Sweet Avatar--\r\n  Hope-crowned and Sorrow-kissed\r\n      Standeth our Star.\r\n\r\n  JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=TROTWOOD’S MONTHLY= Devoted to Farm, Horse and Home.\r\n\r\nTROTWOOD PUBLISHING COMPANY, Nashville, Tenn.\r\n\r\n  JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE, Editor-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n  E.

OCTOBER, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Trotwood\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are nearly a fourth of a thousand farm papers in the United\r\nStates, all bent on teaching the farmers how to attend to their own\r\nbusiness. Some of these papers are good, many are bad and the others\r\nare awful. The good ones may be had for a dollar and the others for the\r\nasking. Looking the literary field over, everybody seems to be entitled\r\nto something good but the farmer. From the roasts and broils of the\r\nintellectual feasts of to-day he will get the leavings, next week, in\r\nthe shape of a stale hash, served on cheap paper, flanked with guessing\r\ncontests and patent medicine advertisements and surrounded by the\r\ngreen, green cresses of the same old thing.\r\n\r\nAnd yet a large and most respectable majority of the people of these\r\nUnited States are farmers or interested in the soil. Their daily needs\r\ninclude all the things the man in the city needs and much more, for\r\nthe man in the city does not plow, neither does he reap nor sow. These\r\npeople of the soil are progressive to the extent of their chances,\r\nhonest, and seekers of the truth and better ways, lovers of the good\r\nin fiction and in fact. They constitute about seventy per cent of our\r\npopulation and commit about two per cent of our crime. Why should not\r\nthey have a literature? Why should not a magazine laid around the soil,\r\ncome into their homes, as it comes into the homes of the dwellers in\r\nthe strenuous city, not to teach them their business but to help to\r\namuse, to interest, to uplift?\r\n\r\nThis is the object of Trotwood’s Monthly. If it does not tell you\r\nwhen to plant your beans and when to eat your potatoes, it hopes to\r\ngive you a literature that will help you to be satisfied with your\r\ndiet of potatoes and your burden of beans. For in truth, the editor\r\nof Trotwood’s Monthly does not know all about potatoes nor beans nor\r\ncorn. Indeed, he is willing to admit that any good farmer in all this\r\ncountry who knows his business knows more about it than the editor of\r\nTrotwood’s Monthly. For his business in life is literature. He has\r\nmade it his profession, as the farmer or stockman has made farming and\r\nstock-raising his, and he has toiled at it through years in the heat of\r\nthe noonday sun and often--often--while the world around him slept, by\r\nthe light of a sleepless lamp. He will not try to tell you, therefore,\r\nof the things he knows but little about, neither will he attempt to\r\ncarry intellectual coals to a new castle of newly mown hay. He will\r\nnot attempt the impossible and the ridiculous; but if, in looking over\r\nhis handiwork month after month, you find something to make you forget\r\nfor awhile the burdens and problems of life; if through his magazine\r\nyou learn to realize the unseen sweetness and independence of the life\r\nof him who claims kindred with the soil; if you are shown nature with\r\ntruer eye, and learn to love her and all that is hers; if you catch,\r\nnow and then, a spark of that finer spirit that burns so brightly in\r\ntrue literature, lighting the lamp of ambition in your boy or girl, and\r\ncarrying you for a moment from the world of soil to the world of soul;\r\nif something in it uplifts you, and something amuses you and something\r\nin the special features by experts in the classes, who know, instructs\r\nand helps you, then you may know that Trotwood’s Monthly has done for\r\nyou what it started out to do.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTrotwood’s Monthly will, each issue, contain special expert articles\r\non subjects relating to its scope. There are four in this issue,\r\nand we have reason to be proud of all of them. This is an age of\r\nconcentration, of specialization. It is the man who concentrates that\r\naccomplishes. Knowledge to-day is so vast and covers so great a scope\r\nthat Solomon’s wisdom would scarcely attract attention unless the\r\nsaffron press wrote him with pictures of his wives, and that might make\r\nsome think he was not wise at all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLINES TO AN AUTOMOBILE.\r\n\r\n  Break, break, break,\r\n    Some other man’s face with glee,\r\n  Or shatter his collar-bone if you will,\r\n    But, pray, don’t run over me!\r\n\r\n  O, woe is the farmer’s boy\r\n    As he shouts with his sister at play.\r\n  But the chauffeur darts from a cloud of dust,\r\n    And carries a leg away.\r\n\r\n  O, woe is the man who drives\r\n    Where the automobile sweeps;\r\n  His horse butts into the wayside wall\r\n    And smashes the cart for keeps.\r\n\r\n  And the big machine goes on,\r\n    A-kiting over the hill,\r\n  But, O, for the touch of a vanished hand\r\n    And the sound of a voice that is still.\r\n\r\n  Break, break, break,\r\n    Whate’er in your path you see,\r\n  But an arm and an ear and a horse that is dead\r\n    Will never come back to me.\r\n\r\n  --From a Horseman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis is the page where all of those who wish to, or who have a message\r\nto tell, may come in and talk with Trotwood. Do not be backward--you\r\nare welcome. But be sure that what you write shall be of general\r\ninterest to our readers. Remember that they are paying for the Monthly\r\nto be interested and instructed. So come in, but come in with something\r\nto say, something that will help others.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor, indeed, Trotwood is optimistic. He believes in men and women; he\r\nhas faith in humanity. He would have men look up, not down; forward,\r\nnot backward. He is too busy doing to garner doubt and discouragement,\r\nthose twins which come chiefly from idleness and unclear thinking.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTherefore, think clearly and live purely. For one depends upon the\r\nother. Believe in the men and women around you and they will soon begin\r\nto believe in themselves. Get into the habit of thinking and speaking\r\nkindly, for character as well as life is made up of habits. Believe in\r\nhumanity. Try to be patient with fools. It is the most difficult of all\r\nthings to do. Believe in humanity. Sometimes you will get a jolt, but\r\nwhen you come to weigh your own life, you will find that, taking it all\r\nin all, the world has been kinder to you than you have deserved.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe may be pardoned for being often personal in this, the first issue\r\nof Trotwood’s Monthly, but we beg you to bear in mind that this issue\r\nwas created hurriedly, and while we are not ashamed of it by any means,\r\nwe did not have the chance to give it the scope it will soon attain.\r\nThis is not a sectional monthly. Its aim is to cover the whole country\r\nNorth and South. We are selling farm literature--not farm products--and\r\nwe will see that all sections, Michigan as well as Alabama, Maine as\r\nwell as Texas, is represented. If you are not in it it will be your own\r\nfault.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA bright literary woman--one who has written novels that have sold--in\r\na personal letter, says: “The publication of a book figures to me as\r\na marriage, in which the author is the woman, the publisher the man,\r\nand it is not well to let one’s heart ache too much over mistreated\r\noffspring in the way of books. Be glad that it is for a year. Just a\r\nyear, that the contract is not for life, and that in it divorce is no\r\ndisgrace, and with the optimistic belief that there is always to be\r\nbetter luck next time.”\r\n\r\nWas ever anything better said?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe most encouraging news comes from the bedside of that veteran\r\nbreeder, Capt. M. C. Campbell, of Cleburne Farm. Capt. Campbell has\r\nbeen very ill for over a month, and once it looked as if the owner of\r\nBrown Hal and the breeder of more great Jerseys and pacing horses than\r\nany living man, would not recover. But the life he has led has been\r\nclean and pure, and his strength was great. Like the great Tennessee\r\npacers he has bred he proved game, and his friends, and they are\r\ncounted all who know him, are happy to think he is now on the road\r\nto recovery. No man in the State has made a higher mark for honesty,\r\nmanhood and all that makes a man than Capt. M. C. Campbell, and may he\r\nlive long and prosper.\r\n\r\nIn a personal letter from his son, Mr. Allen Campbell, who is also\r\nmanager of Cleburne Farm, he writes that they have some of the greatest\r\ncolts and Jerseys ever seen at that famous nursery. Several of their\r\ncolts are showing extreme speed, among them being the young son of\r\nBrown Hal, dam by Bay Tom, that Cleburne Farm has reserved to take\r\nBrown Hal’s place. He is showing 2:10 speed as a three-year-old. Two\r\ncolts by Direct 2:05-1/2, one out of the dam of Twinkle 2:06-1/2, are\r\nshowing up very fast. Trainer John Walker has a dozen head of Mr.\r\nGeers’ stable training them at Cleburne’s famous mile track.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSpeaking of John R. Gentry’s influence at Ewell Farm Mr. Geo. Campbell\r\nBrown writes:\r\n\r\n“It is the aim of Ewell Farm to breed beauty and let speed stand as a\r\nsecondary consideration, and for this reason it continues the use of\r\nMcEwen, one of the grandest individuals in the country, as shown by his\r\nlong list of showing prizes and of John R. Gentry, a horse of perfect\r\nconformation and unbeaten in the show ring.\r\n\r\n“The Hal strain at Ewell Farm is being perpetuated by Hal Brown,\r\ncertainly one of the most successful young sires of that breed.\r\n\r\n“The brood mares at Ewell Farm are in proportion to the numbers owned\r\nthere, the greatest collection of producers in the United States. No\r\nless than four have produced four each to beat 2:30, and ten are\r\nproducers of 2:10 or better horses, while one has thrown a world’s\r\nchampion.\r\n\r\n“The blood of Sweepstakes, dam of Star Pointer, is better represented\r\nat Ewell Farm than at any other farm in the country. Two of her\r\ngranddaughters, Mabel Best and Windsweep, daughters of Villette, sister\r\nto Star Pointer, being owned there, and both have foals by John R.\r\nGentry.\r\n\r\n“Of the dozen yearlings at Ewell Farm by John R. Gentry, only one\r\nhas been trained, and he a trotter can now show a 2:52 gait. He will\r\ncertainly make a great trotter.\r\n\r\n“A three-year-old trotter by this great sire has beaten 2:20, and a\r\nthree-year-old pacer, Gentry’s Star, can pace a mile in 2:10.

Gentry\r\nforeshadows his future fame as a sire, and it is a safe prediction that\r\nhe will more than equal his sire, Ashland Wilkes, that has for several\r\nyears been the leading sire of new 2:30 performers. Analysis of records\r\nin John R. Gentry’s pedigree show him to be the fastest and best son of\r\nAshland Wilkes. This horse is in turn the best representative of Red\r\nWilkes, the greatest speed sire of all the sons of George Wilkes, whose\r\nstrain has been preeminent in the trotting world for twenty-five years.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTrotwood can vouch for every word of the following letter. He visited\r\nthe great Dakota prairies last fall. Such vastness, such fertility,\r\nsuch lands!\r\n\r\n  Fargo, N. D., August 15.\r\n\r\nEditor Trotwood’s Monthly:\r\n\r\nWhen I was a resident of your country I thought then that there was\r\nonly one God’s country, and that was the Central Basin of Tennessee. My\r\nreason for arriving at such a conclusion was the land in the Central\r\nBasin, but more particularly in and around Maury County, had maintained\r\nits fertility and wonderful productive power for a hundred years with\r\nonly the ordinary American style of farming. That is, taking all out\r\nof the land and putting nothing back again. But since that time a\r\ndiscovery has been made which accounts for the land in your section\r\nof country maintaining its wonderful endurance for raising such an\r\nexcellent quality of wheat over a period of seventy years, without\r\nrotation of crops, and that is the almost inexhaustible deposit of\r\nphosphate rock that underlies so much of your lands. But I have found\r\nanother God’s country. While it cannot boast of being underlaid with\r\nphosphate rock like your lands in and around Maury County, but when\r\nthis country was opened up for settlement in the ’70’s it was as\r\nrich in all the constituent elements of fertility as the lands in\r\nthe Central Basin of Tennessee. This Red River Valley is a wonderful\r\ncountry, and Fargo, N. D., is the center of this granary of the great\r\nNorthwest. Although Fargo is not a very large city, the population is\r\nabout twelve or thirteen thousand inhabitants, it is a live town, and\r\nfull of enterprising business men.\r\n\r\nThis town is the third largest farm implement distributing point in the\r\nworld. That’s saying a good deal. Moscow, Russia, comes first; Kansas\r\nCity second, and Fargo third. According to the Bureau of Statistics,\r\nUnited States Department of Agriculture, for 1904, the State of North\r\nDakota produced some fifty-four million bushels of wheat and the set\r\ncounties in the Red River Valley raised of the above amount nearly\r\ntwelve million bushels. This is not counting the Minnesota side of\r\nthe Red River Valley. The farmers in the Red River Valley seem to be\r\npretty well fixed. The great Dalrymple farm is in this county of Cass.\r\nThese gentlemen farm about 30,000 acres of wheat land. The soil in\r\nthis valley is a rich, black, glacial drift, and though it is not corn\r\ncountry, not being warm enough, yet all other farm products do fine\r\n(there is an immense crop this year), as wheat, oats, barley, rye,\r\nbuckwheat, flaxseed, hay and the most excellent Irish potatoes are\r\nraised here, and 200 bushels per acre is a fair crop. But the farmers\r\nin the Red River Valley have been raising wheat almost exclusively for\r\nthe past twenty-five years, and wheat of fine quality. But if they want\r\nto maintain the reputation of this land as a wheat-growing country, the\r\nfarmers will have to put on their considering caps and ask you Maury\r\nCountians to send them up some acid phosphate to put and keep their\r\nland in balance, so that they can go on and again raise No. 1 hard\r\nwheat.\r\n\r\n  WM.

Far away Halifax, N.\r\nS., sends a good list in the same mail with New Braunsfels, Southern\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\nI am indeed proud of this, for it is the work of my personal friends,\r\nwhose loyalty and friendship have no measure; who in the past have\r\nsent me words of comfort and cheer, in my fight through the columns of\r\nthat great turf journal, “The Horse Review,” for what I conceived to\r\nbe clean living, clean thinking, clean racing and clean and hopeful\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nI have longed for this day when I might talk to my many friends\r\nthrough the columns of my own publication, and in the department “With\r\nTrotwood” I want to meet you often, and I want you to meet each other.\r\n\r\nTo my old tried and true friend, John C. Bauer, of the Chicago Horse\r\nReview, whose firm and lasting friendship has helped to make life\r\npleasant, and whose sterling manhood and unfailing courtesy in the\r\ntwelve years that I was associated with the Horse Review, has endeared\r\nhim to me and given me greater faith in man, I extend my hearty and\r\nsincere thanks for the unselfish way in which he has so cheerfully and\r\nwillingly helped in starting us down the track of literature toward\r\nwhat promises to be a successful goal.\r\n\r\nTo my many other friends who have responded so liberally with their\r\ndollars and who have been so free with their expressions of loyalty and\r\ngood will, I thank you one and all, and I wish that I could meet each\r\nand every one of you, and with a hearty handshake tell you how much I\r\nappreciate your friendship and your encouragement.\r\n\r\nWith my very best wishes and regards to all, I am sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n  JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA word from the Business Manager:\r\n\r\nIf you feel friendly toward Trotwood, no doubt you feel just as\r\nfriendly toward “Trotwood’s Monthly.” I want every reader of this\r\nmonthly to write us a letter, sending us the names and address of your\r\nfriends whom you think would be interested in this monthly.
