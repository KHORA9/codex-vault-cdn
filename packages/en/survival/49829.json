These lakes developed in\r\nintermontane basins that were created as a result of the geologic events\r\nthat formed the Rocky Mountains. The three lakes, collectively known as\r\nthe Green River Lake System, had a long, complex history of expansion\r\nand contraction. Varying climatic and geologic conditions were\r\nresponsible for the changes in lake size and distribution.\r\n\r\nThe shores surrounding the lakes were blanketed by a lush, green canopy\r\nof palm, cinnamon, maple, oak, and other familiar trees. Hazel and lilac\r\ncovered the forest floor. Rushes and other aquatic plants lined the lake\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nThe air was humid and warm. Streams flowing down from the hills and\r\nmountains built up flood plains and fed sediment into the lake, where it\r\nwas deposited in shallow water near the shore. Deposits formed by\r\nchemical processes settled to the bottom further from shore in deep,\r\nquiet water. From these processes were formed the rocks from which the\r\npast history of Green River Lake System is read.\r\n\r\nIn the forest and undergrowth lived the ancestors of modern mammal\r\ngroups. Ancestral rodents and tiny insectivores lived a furtive\r\nexistence in the brush and mold that carpeted the forest floor, or else\r\nthey sought a livelihood among the branches of trees. Large, bizarre\r\nanimals with strange names lumbered through the reed-covered streamsides\r\neating soft, succulent plants. The earliest members of the horse family\r\nbrowsed on the soft vegetation. The trees overhead were alive with the\r\nchattering and antics of early primates. Carnivorous mammals preyed on\r\ntheir plant-eating neighbors and so maintained a balanced community.\r\nCrocodiles and turtles basked in the sun on the beach. Flamingos\r\nconcentrated in large nesting grounds. Snakes and lizards crawled about\r\nin the undergrowth. Insects, many exceedingly similar to modern types,\r\nflew about in the warm air or crept about on the plants.\r\n\r\nThe waters of the lakes teemed with many types of fish. Relatives of the\r\nperch, herring, and sting ray swam in the warm lake water. Occasionally,\r\nlarge-scale mortalities of the fish occurred. As the fish died, they\r\nsank to the bottom of the lake, and were preserved in the lake\r\nsediments.\r\n\r\nToday, the lakes are gone and where once there were lush tropical\r\nforests there is now a semi-desert covered with sagebrush and\r\ngreasewood. The history of these lakes, forests, and animal life can be\r\nread in the thick sediments deposited so long ago.\r\n\r\nThis report concerns itself with one of these lakes, the smallest of the\r\nthree, Fossil Lake. Famous for its fossil fish beds, part of this\r\nancient lake is now Fossil Butte National Monument. It is the purpose of\r\nthis report to relate the history of Fossil Lake and its now fossilized\r\ninhabitants, thereby, hopefully presenting the order of events in a\r\nlandscape obscured by 50 million years of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LOCATION\r\n\r\n\r\nFossil Butte National Monument is near the geographical center of Fossil\r\nBasin. The basin itself is located in the extreme southwestern part of\r\nWyoming in Uinta and Lincoln counties, near the Utah-Idaho border (Fig.\r\n2).\r\n\r\nThe monument is situated about 10 miles west of Kemmerer, Lincoln\r\nCounty, Wyoming (Fig. 3). U.S. Highway 30N runs just south of the\r\nmonument as does the Union Pacific Railroad line to Oregon. The\r\nabandoned town of Fossil is also immediately south of the monument.\r\n\r\nThe Kemmerer and Sage quadrangles of the United States Geological Survey\r\ncover the entire monument and the surrounding area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF RESEARCH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal rocks involved at Fossil Butte are the Green River and\r\nWasatch formations. The first published notice of these two rock units\r\nwas by Hayden (1869). Although short, Hayden’s descriptions were the\r\nbasis for later refinement of the stratigraphy of the Green River and\r\nFossil basins. Hayden also mentioned the quantities of fossil fish from\r\nthe Green River Formation.\r\n\r\nThe work done by Hayden was conducted under the auspices of the U.S.\r\nDepartment of the Interior, Geological and Geographical Survey of the\r\nTerritories. The survey lasted from 1867 to 1878, during which time\r\nHayden and his associates published annual reports of their findings.\r\n\r\nIn the 1870 report, Hayden (1871) mentioned the discovery of the\r\nPetrified Fish Cut. This cut is located on the main line of the Union\r\nPacific Railroad about 2 miles west of Green River, Wyoming. A. W.\r\nHilliard and L. E. Rickseeker, employees of the Union Pacific Railroad,\r\ndiscovered the cut and obtained many fossil fish which they turned over\r\nto Hayden.\r\n\r\nPrevious to Hayden, rocks now known as the Green River and Wasatch\r\nformations were occasionally mentioned in the various diaries, journals,\r\nand reports of early missionaries like those of S. A. Parker or those of\r\nexplorers like Fremont (Knight 1955).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 1. Paleocene-Eocene lake system (after Schaeffer\r\n    and Mangun 1965).]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 2. Geographic features of southwest Wyoming and\r\n    adjacent areas (from Oriel and Tracey 1970).]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 3. Physiography of the Fossil Butte National\r\n    Monument region (from U.S. Department of the Interior 1964).]\r\n\r\nHayden’s report (1871:425-437) included a description of the fish\r\nfossils from Petrified Fish Cut by E. D. Cope, a vertebrate\r\npaleontologist. Several years earlier Leidy (1856), another\r\npaleontologist, described a fish from an unknown locality in the Green\r\nRiver Formation.\r\n\r\nHayden divided this survey area into several districts. The Green River\r\ndistrict was put in charge of A. C. Peale. Peale’s (1879:535) report\r\ncontained the first geologic description of Fossil Butte itself, as well\r\nas a short discussion of the fish fossils obtained there. The\r\ndescription of the butte is quoted here:\r\n\r\n  ... In the lower part of the bluff from which these specimens are\r\n  taken, the bright coloured beds of the Wasatch are seen outcropping,\r\n  although the entire section cannot be seen, as their softness causes\r\n  them to weather so that the debris conceals the strata. The fossils\r\n  are found at several horizons in the shales. Near the top of the bluff\r\n  is a band of hard, bituminous, or oily shale, which burns rather\r\n  freely with a strong bituminous odor.... It is brownish-black in color\r\n  and on the weathered surfaces a bluish white....\r\n\r\nThe next major publication dealing with Fossil Basin was that by Veatch\r\n(1907). He mapped the rocks in certain areas of the basin in an attempt\r\nto bring a semblance of order to Hayden’s (1869) broad stratigraphic\r\ndescriptions. His work resulted in the designation of most of the rock\r\nunits in Fossil Basin from Jurassic to Recent.\r\n\r\nSchultz (1914), an associate of Veatch, published a paper dealing with\r\nthe structures to the north and east of Fossil Basin. This helped to\r\ndelineate the features surrounding and forming the basin.\r\n\r\nSubsequent work on the geology of southwest Wyoming mainly has been\r\nconcentrated on the Green River Basin just east of Fossil Basin.\r\nSignificant work on Fossil Basin has been done by Rubey et al. (1968a,\r\nb) who mapped the northern part of the basin, and by Oriel and Tracey\r\n(1970) who have published results of the latest study on the\r\nstratigraphy and age of the rock units in Fossil Basin. This latest work\r\nis the culmination of many years of study and incorporates and refines\r\ndata presented in shorter, earlier papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              STRATIGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe complete geologic history of the Fossil Basin involves many\r\nstratigraphic units. Most of these are not exposed within the monument\r\nitself but are well known from outcrops outside the boundaries of the\r\nmonument and from deep wells (Fig. 4).\r\n\r\nAt the base of the stratigraphic section are rocks of Precambrian age.\r\nThese have not been penetrated by wells within the Fossil Basin but\r\nshould occur as much as 25,000 ft beneath the surface. They probably\r\nconsist of metamorphic and intrusive rocks. Beginning about 600 million\r\nyears ago, at the beginning of Cambrian time, sedimentary deposits\r\naccumulated. These are both marine and continental in origin and range\r\nin age from early Cambrian (600 million years old) to early Tertiary (50\r\nmillion years old). Some 34 geologic formations are recognized in this\r\nthick section, a list of which follows:\r\n\r\n  Eocene                Fowkes Formation\r\n                        Wasatch-Green River Formations\r\n  Paleocene             Evanston Formation (upper part)\r\n  Upper Cretaceous      Evanston Formation (lower part)\r\n                        Adaville Formation\r\n                        Lazeart Sandstone\r\n                        Hilliard Shale\r\n                        Frontier Formation\r\n  Lower Cretaceous      Aspen Shale\r\n                        Bear River Formation\r\n                        Gannett Group\r\n  Jurassic              Stump Sandstone\r\n                        Preuss Sandstone\r\n                        Twin Creek Limestone\r\n                        Nugget Sandstone (upper part)\r\n  Triassic              Nugget Sandstone (lower part)\r\n                        Thaynes Limestone\r\n                        Woodside Formation\r\n                        Dinwoody Formation\r\n  Permian               Phosphoria Formation\r\n  Pennsylvanian         Wells Formation\r\n  Mississippian         Brazer Limestone\r\n                        Madison Limestone (upper part)\r\n  Devonian              Madison Limestone (lower part)\r\n                        Darby Formation\r\n  Silurian              Not Present\r\n  Ordovician            Leigh Dolomite\r\n                        Bighorn Dolomite\r\n  Cambrian              Gallatin Limestone\r\n                        Gros Ventre Formation\r\n  Precambrian           Complex of metamorphic and intrusive rocks\r\n\r\nWithin the monument itself the oldest rocks exposed are those of the\r\nThaynes Limestone near Prow Point. As will be seen in the discussion of\r\nthe structure of the Fossil Basin, all of the rocks beneath the Evanston\r\nFormation are folded and faulted and within the monument are buried by\r\ndeposits of Tertiary age. For this reason detailed discussion of\r\nstratigraphic units will be confined to those rocks that can be seen\r\nwithin the boundaries of the monument or closely adjacent to it (Fig. 5\r\n).

This formation is noted for its\r\nrich and varied assemblage of marine fossils, mostly forms related to\r\noysters and clams. The Thaynes Limestone consists predominantly of\r\nsandy, gray limestone and green-gray limey siltstones. The formation\r\nweathers to a dark brown in the lower part and a grayish-yellow in the\r\nupper. The fact that the Thaynes Limestone is exposed in the monument at\r\nall is because of the faulting that took place just prior to the\r\ndeposition of the Evanston Formation of latest Cretaceous and earliest\r\nTertiary age (refer to section on structure) and the erosion of the\r\nTertiary rocks that once covered it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Evanston Formation\r\n\r\nAlthough not seen within the boundaries of the Fossil Butte National\r\nMonument, the Evanston Formation is exposed just south of Highway 30N,\r\n1.5 miles southeast of the southeast corner of the monument. The\r\nEvanston was not involved in the complex folding and faulting but it is\r\nsomewhat disturbed and rests under the Wasatch Formation with angular\r\nuncomformity. The Evanston Formation bridges the time boundary between\r\nthe Cretaceous and Tertiary periods. In the lower part of the unit are\r\nfound many fossil leaves, pollen, and spores and a jaw of the horned\r\ndinosaur _Triceratops_ that prove its Cretaceous age, and in the upper\r\npart are found fossil mammals of Paleocene age.\r\n\r\nThe Evanston Formation has been studied in detail by Oriel and Tracey\r\n(1970). These authors divide the formation into three members. The\r\nlowest, which they called the Lower Member, is predominantly “gray to\r\nvery dark gray mudstone, siltstone, claystone and gray carbonaceous\r\nsandstone.” The Lower Member reaches a thickness of 500 ft in some\r\nplaces. Above and in part interfingering with the Lower Member is a 1000\r\nft thick unit that was named the Hams Fork Conglomerate Member. This\r\nunit consists of beds of boulder conglomerate interstratified with thick\r\nbeds of coarse, partly conglomeratic brown sandstone and gray mudstone.\r\nWhere the Lower Member of the Evanston is missing, the Hams Fork\r\nConglomerate forms the base of the formation.\r\n\r\nThe Upper Member of the Evanston Formation is termed by Oriel and Tracey\r\n(1970) the Main Body. It is more than a thousand feet thick and the\r\nlower part intertongues with the Hams Fork Conglomerate. The Main Body\r\nis “light to dark gray carbonaceous sandy to clayey siltstone\r\ninterbedded with gray, tan, yellow and brown sandstone and conglomerate\r\nand carbonaceous to lignitic claystone.” It is this Main Body that can\r\nbe seen along the highway just southeast of the monument.\r\n\r\nThe types of sediments and fossils found in the Evanston indicate that\r\nthe formation was deposited by streams on flood plains and in marshes\r\nand ponds. A subtropical climate is indicated and the area was heavily\r\nwooded.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Wasatch Formation\r\n\r\nThe term Wasatch was first used by Hayden (1869:91) as follows:\r\n\r\n  Immediately west of Fort Bridger commences one of the most remarkable\r\n  and extensive groups of Tertiary beds seen in the West. They are\r\n  wonderfully variegated, some shade of red predominating. This group,\r\n  to which I have given the name of Wasatch group, is composed of\r\n  variegated sands and clays. Very little calcareous matter is found in\r\n  these beds.\r\n\r\n  In Echo and Weber Canyons are wonderful displays of conglomerates,\r\n  fifteen hundred to two thousand feet in thickness. Although this group\r\n  occupies a vast area, and attains a thickness of three to five\r\n  thousand feet, yet I have never known any remains of animals to be\r\n  found in it. I regard it, however, as of middle Tertiary age.\r\n\r\nThe Wasatch is well exposed in Fossil Basin. There the unit was regarded\r\nby Veatch (1907) as a group and divided by him into three formations:\r\nthe Almy, Fowkes, and Knight. He wrote (1907:88):\r\n\r\n  In the Wasatch group as thus defined by Hayden the field work of the\r\n  season 1905 showed three divisions: 1) a basal member composed of\r\n  reddish-yellow sandy clays, in many places containing pronounced\r\n  conglomerate beds, which has been named the Almy Formation; 2) a great\r\n  thickness of light-colored rhyolitic ash beds containing intercalated\r\n  lenses of white limestones with fresh-water shells and leaves—the\r\n  Fowkes Formation; and 3) a group of reddish-yellow sandy clays with\r\n  irregular sandstone beds (the Knight Formation) closely resembling 1)\r\n  lithologically and separated from 1) & 2) by a pronounced period of\r\n  folding and erosion.\r\n\r\nVeatch, however, erred in his field work and did not realize that the\r\nFowkes Formation had been downfaulted into the position in which he saw\r\nit (Tracey and Oriel 1959; Eardley 1959). The Fowkes is actually the\r\nyoungest of the three formations of Veatch and is considerably later in\r\nage than the true Wasatch.\r\n\r\nThe Almy and Knight formations are not separable (Oriel and Tracey\r\n1970:16), and can be seen to grade into each other at the basin edges.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 5.

These authors proposed that\r\nthe terms Almy and Knight be dropped and that the name Wasatch be\r\napplied to all these rocks to avoid confusion.\r\n\r\nThe latest subdivision of the Wasatch Formation in the Fossil Basin is\r\nthat of Oriel and Tracey. The members of the Wasatch Formation they\r\npropose are described in order from oldest to youngest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       BASAL CONGLOMERATE MEMBER.\r\n\r\nThis member has only local development in Fossil Basin. Where found, it\r\nis a lenticular conglomerate with pebbles and cobbles of buff and tan\r\nsandstone from the Nugget Sandstone and limestone fragments from the\r\nThaynes and Twin Creek formations.\r\n\r\nThe basal conglomerate is essentially a channel fill in ancient stream\r\nbeds cut into Mesozoic rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             LOWER MEMBER.\r\n\r\nThis is an irregular sequence of flood-plain and stream-channel\r\ndeposits. It is exposed along the southern part of the Tunp Range and\r\nextends into the far western section of Fossil Butte National Monument\r\njust below Prow Point.\r\n\r\nMudstone is the main rock type. It can be tan, brown, pink, red, or gray\r\nin color. Black, carbonaceous siltstones are also present. Gray\r\nsandstone that weathers yellow or brown and coarse-grained, cross-bedded\r\nconglomerate and sandstone are also prominent. Limestone occurs as thin\r\nlenses and is often brown, platy, and carbonaceous.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the Lower Member is intermediate not only\r\nin stratigraphic position but also in color and composition between the\r\nunderlying Evanston Formation and overlying Main Body of the Wasatch\r\nFormation. The Lower Member thus appears to represent a gradual change\r\nin either climatic and/or sedimentary conditions in Fossil Basin (Oriel\r\nand Tracey 1970).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 7.

Particularly typical exposures can be seen in the south-facing\r\nscarp of Fossil Butte where the Main Body makes up the lower portion of\r\nthe butte.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable feature of the Main Body is its color. On the lower\r\nslopes of Fossil Butte are bands of bright to dull red, pink, purple,\r\nyellow, and gray color arranged in various patterns. This unit is best\r\nobserved at a distance, especially after a rain. The bright hues of the\r\nWasatch contrast markedly with the whites and tans of the overlying\r\nGreen River Formation.\r\n\r\nIndividual bands of color range from 1 to 10 ft thick (Oriel and Tracey\r\n1970:78). The colors are brightest in the upper part of the member and\r\ndrabber in the coarser-grained lower part.\r\n\r\nThe predominant rock types in the Main Body are banded, variegated\r\nmudstone with interlayered sandstone, conglomerate, marlstone,\r\nsiltstone, and claystone.\r\n\r\nThe upper part of the Main Body is mainly mudstone composed of fine silt\r\nand very fine, bedded sand with a clay binder. Conglomerates occur as\r\nchannel fills and contain calcium carbonate as cement as do a number of\r\nsandstone and siltstone layers in the upper Main Body.\r\n\r\nConglomerates and sandstone are more common in the lower part of the\r\nMain Body. Some are part of Veatch’s old Almy Formation. They are best\r\ndeveloped along the edge of Fossil Basin. The Main Body overlaps the\r\nEvanston Formation in some places and may rest directly on Mesozoic or\r\nPaleozoic rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SANDSTONE TONGUE.\r\n\r\nThis is a tongue of cross-bedded sandstone. It is brown in color and is\r\ncomposed mostly of quartz with some black chert grains. This unit is\r\nlimited in distribution to the south of Fossil Butte National Monument.\r\nThe Sandstone Tongue thins and pinches out to the north and is not\r\npresent within the monument. The area of pinchout represents the\r\nshoreline at one stage of Fossil Lake. The Sandstone Tongue wedges into\r\nthe Fossil Butte Member of the Green River Formation. The sediment\r\nsources were probably the Uinta Mountains at the south edge of Fossil\r\nBasin. Tectonic events caused an uplift and erosion of Mesozoic and\r\nPaleozoic rocks in the Uintas and debris was deposited in Fossil Lake as\r\nan encroaching delta of sand. When deposition of the sand halted, the\r\nlake expanded and covered the sand, encasing it within the shales of the\r\nGreen River Formation.\r\n\r\nThe Sandstone Tongue can be traced into the Main Body of the Wasatch,\r\nhence its assignment to the Wasatch Formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MUDSTONE TONGUE.\r\n\r\nThis tongue of the Wasatch Formation can be seen in the northwestern\r\npart of Fossil Butte National Monument and over most of the northern\r\npart of Fossil Basin. In the area of its distribution, the Mudstone\r\nTongue separates the underlying Fossil Butte Member of the Green River\r\nFormation from the overlying Angelo Member of the Green River Formation.\r\nThe tongue thins and disappears to the south, that is, basinward. As\r\nwith the Sandstone Tongue, the edges of the Mudstone Tongue where it\r\npinches out represent an ancient shoreline of Fossil Lake. To the north\r\nand west the Mudstone Tongue merges with the Tunp Member of the Wasatch\r\nFormation.\r\n\r\nThe Mudstone Tongue is a composite of dark-red mudstone which becomes\r\nlighter in color basinward, changing to light red, pink, or\r\ngreenish-gray claystone. The unit is a mixture of silt and clay derived\r\nfrom the north and west, and was deposited as a large delta in Fossil\r\nLake.\r\n\r\nAn interesting aspect of the Mudstone Tongue is the presence of algal\r\nlogs. These are cylinders of limestone that apparently formed as an\r\nencrustation of calcium carbonate around logs and branches that fell\r\ninto the edge of the lake. The calcium carbonate resulted from the\r\naction of algae which grew around the log. Successive growths of algae\r\nresulted in successive layers of calcium carbonate being deposited.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BULLPEN MEMBER.\r\n\r\nThis uppermost member of the Wasatch Formation is found mostly to the\r\nwest and south of the monument. A few, small, isolated caps on the top\r\nof the Green River Formation east of Prow Point occur within the\r\nmonument. These low hills, mere bumps, are remnants of a once more\r\nextensive distribution of the Bullpen Member.\r\n\r\nVeatch (1907:99) originally considered what is now called the Bullpen\r\nMember as being the Bridger Formation, this was based mostly on the\r\nBullpen’s position above the Green River Formation rather than on any\r\nlithologic resemblance to the Bridger. The Bullpen is much redder in\r\ncolor than the Bridger.\r\n\r\nIn early work Tracey and Oriel (1959:729) called these beds an upper\r\ntongue of the Wasatch and have since named them the Bullpen Member.\r\n\r\nThe Bullpen Member is lithologically very like the Main Body of the\r\nWasatch and can be traced into the peripheral units of the Wasatch\r\nFormation.\r\n\r\nThe rocks included within the Bullpen Member are layered sequences of\r\nred, pink, gray, and green claystone and mudstone. Bentonite is present\r\nin some claystone beds and causes sloughing because of its property of\r\nexpanding when wet. Some sandstones are present in the northern areas of\r\nthe member’s distribution. Limestones are also present. They are thin\r\nand slabby and have a brown, white, or gray color. Some contain varying\r\namounts of clay. A conglomerate is present in the upper part of the\r\nBullpen toward the basin periphery and merges with the Tunp Member of\r\nthe Wasatch Formation.\r\n\r\nThe Bullpen Member is conformable with the underlying Angelo Member of\r\nthe Green River Formation. The contact is a transitional one reflecting\r\na gradual change from the lake environment of the Green River Formation\r\nthrough a swamp environment to that of a flood plain. The light-colored,\r\nfine-grained shales, marlstones, and limestones of the Green River\r\nFormation grade upward into drabber, coarser grained clay and mudstones\r\nof the Bullpen Member as a reflection of this change of environments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              TUNP MEMBER.\r\n\r\nThis peripheral unit of the Wasatch Formation was first described by\r\nOriel and Tracey in 1970. It is not exposed in the monument, but forms a\r\nbelt of outcrops around the edge of Fossil Basin and in channels cut at\r\nright angles to the basin edge.\r\n\r\nThe Tunp Member is seen to intertongue with nearly all of the Wasatch\r\nand Green River formations. The member grades laterally basinward from\r\ncoarse, angular conglomerates to fine mudstone. Two limestone tongues of\r\nthe Green River Formation are interbedded with the Tunp, indicating that\r\nat least twice there was major expansion of the lake.\r\n\r\nLithologically, the Tunp Member is a diamictite. This is a sedimentary\r\nrock with a wide range of particle sizes. The Tunp is best described as\r\na red, conglomeratic, sandy mudstone with angular, poorly rounded to\r\nsmooth, well-rounded clasts with a size range from pebble to boulder.\r\nThere is no bedding or orientation of clasts.\r\n\r\nThe Tunp Member probably originated from mudflows and gravity sliding\r\n(Tracey et al. 1961). Environmental studies indicate that the area had a\r\nwarm, humid climate. This would cause deep weathering of the surrounding\r\nslopes. This weathered material would then be a prime source to be acted\r\nupon by rain, gravity, and possibly earthquakes. These agents of\r\ndeposition would then cause the material to flow and be deposited with\r\nlittle chance for sorting and rounding of the rock particles. The result\r\nwas a belt of coarse, unsorted detritus on the basin edges now called\r\nthe Tunp Member.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     AGE OF THE WASATCH FORMATION.\r\n\r\nThe exact age of the units within the Wasatch Formation can be\r\ndetermined only if fossils are present. None has been found in the basal\r\nconglomerates but it is believed to be earliest Eocene. The Lower Member\r\nis also not dated with fossils but is believed to be very early Eocene.\r\nA number of fossil mammals are known from the Main Body of the Wasatch\r\nFormation. The lower part is early, early Eocene as demonstrated by the\r\npresence of a very primitive ungulate, _Haplomylus speirianus_. In the\r\nupper part of the Main Body another primitive ungulate, _Hyopsodus\r\nbrowni_, is found which indicates a mid to early Eocene age. The\r\nMudstone and Sandstone tongues are not dated by means of fossils but the\r\nstratigraphic relationships indicate an early Eocene age. Fossil\r\nmollusks in the Bullpen Member are not completely diagnostic but suggest\r\neither a late early Eocene (Lostcabinian) (Fig. 6) or mid-Eocene age.\r\nThe Tunp Member interfingering as it does with the entire Wasatch\r\nsection represents all of early Eocene age.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT.\r\n\r\nThe sediments that make up the Wasatch Formation in the Fossil Basin\r\nwere deposited mainly by streams flowing into the basin from the\r\nsurrounding uplands. Rock types are variable and for the most part\r\nindividual types cannot be traced over large areas, a condition typical\r\nof fluvial environments. The mudstones and siltstones probably were\r\ndeposited along flood plains, while the lenticular sands and\r\nconglomerates were laid down in stream channels. Where streams entered\r\nthe lake tongues of deltaic deposits, sands or mudstones wedge into the\r\nGreen River Lake sediments.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the red color of the Wasatch Formation is not fully\r\nknown. According to Van Houten (1948), the red is most likely the result\r\nof tropical, red lateritic soils forming in the uplands and being\r\ndeposited on flood plains. The oxidation of organic material in a humid,\r\nsubtropical environment causes the red color. The bands of purple, gray,\r\norange, and other colors are due to various stages in the reduction of\r\nthe iron oxides in the rocks.\r\n\r\nThe presence of palms in the lake sediments and of bones of primates and\r\ncrocodiles in both the lacustrine and fluvial sediments indicate a\r\nheavily forested, tropical environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Green River Formation\r\n\r\nThe Green River Formation is easily recognized by its light color and\r\ncontinuous bedding, in strong contrast to the red, discontinuous,\r\nvariegated Wasatch Formation below. The Green River Formation can be\r\nthought of as a gigantic lens of lacustrine sediments enclosed in the\r\nfluvial Wasatch Formation. The name Green River Formation is applied to\r\nall of the roughly contemporaneous deposits laid down in lakes of Utah,\r\nColorado, and Wyoming. It is probable that at one time or another all of\r\nthese lakes were connected.\r\n\r\nOriel and Tracey (1970) have divided the Green River Formation of the\r\nFossil Basin into two members: the Fossil Butte Member and the Angelo\r\nMember.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          FOSSIL BUTTE MEMBER.\r\n\r\nThe type section for this member is near the southeastern end of Fossil\r\nButte within the monument boundaries. In the type area the Fossil Butte\r\nMember can be seen to consist of four lithologic units.\r\n\r\nThe lowermost unit is predominantly mudstone. It occurs in a sequence\r\nabout 45 ft thick and contains light gray, fine-grained, calcareous\r\nmudstone and siltstone.\r\n\r\nThe next overlying unit is about 75 ft thick and is mainly a limestone\r\nunit. It consists of tan to gray limestone, shaly limestone, siltstone,\r\nand paper shale which weathers into thin, curled flakes. A yellow-brown\r\nmudstone tops this unit.\r\n\r\nThe third unit in the sequence is 45 ft thick and mainly composed of\r\nshales. These shales weather a buff color and are calcareous. Oil shale,\r\norganic rich paper shale, and marlstone comprise the actual layers in\r\nthe unit. A few, thin ash beds are also present. This unit is the most\r\nsignificant one for Fossil Butte National Monument. About 10 ft below\r\nthe top of this unit (about 155 ft above the Wasatch) is a bed of varved\r\nshales, one foot thick, that contains the fossil fish for which the\r\nmonument was established.\r\n\r\nThe uppermost unit contains a number of beds of oil shale that are brown\r\non a fresh surface but weather a grayish-white. An\r\norange-yellow-weathering limestone caps the 40-ft thick upper unit. Ash\r\nbeds are common and traceable over a wide area of Fossil Basin.\r\n\r\nSouth of the monument the Sandstone Tongue of the Wasatch Formation\r\nwedges in between the lowermost unit and the overlying limestone unit of\r\nthe Fossil Butte Member.\r\n\r\nIn the Fossil Butte Member an interesting sequence of facies changes can\r\nbe seen which reflect lateral changes in the environment of Fossil Lake.\r\nIn those areas where the member represents a deep-water environment,\r\norganically formed limestones and shales are predominant. Shoreward,\r\nthese rocks grade into ostracodal limestone, gastrapodal limestone, and,\r\nclosest to shore, algal limestone. Then a muddy, sandy beach facies is\r\nencountered where the Green River and Wasatch formations intergrade.\r\n\r\nThe contact with the underlying Wasatch is conformable and sharp. It is\r\noften marked by a bench or by slump blocks of Green River Formation.\r\n\r\nThe Fossil Butte Member may in some cases overlap the Wasatch Formation\r\nand be deposited on Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks. This is a reflection\r\nof topographic relief during the Eocene.\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the Fossil Butte Member, as reported by Oriel and\r\nTracey (1970:37), is from 208 to 269 ft.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ANGELO MEMBER.\r\n\r\nIn the northern part of Fossil Basin, the Mudstone Tongue of the Wasatch\r\nFormation separates the Angelo Member of the Green River Formation from\r\nthe Fossil Butte Member. Further south, the two members rest directly on\r\none another. The southern extent of the Angelo Member has not been\r\ndetermined as yet, but Oriel and Tracey (1970:32) believe it extends up\r\nto, and intertongues with, Wasatch conglomerates near the Uinta\r\nMountains. Toward other edges of Fossil Basin, the Angelo Member thins\r\nand pinches out into the Wasatch Formation. The Bullpen Member of the\r\nWasatch rests on top of the Angelo Member.\r\n\r\nThe Angelo Member consists of white to blue-white weathering limestone,\r\nmarlstone, and mudstone. Some sandstone lenses, claystone, oil shale,\r\nand siliceous limestone are present as well. In general, Oriel and\r\nTracey (1970) have found that buff limestones prevail to the north and\r\nwhite, siliceous limestone, to the south. Like the Fossil Butte Member,\r\nthe Angelo Member shows a facies change from deep-water to shore.\r\n\r\nThis member forms the very uppermost, rounded slopes of Fossil Butte in\r\ncontrast to the more vertical cliffs formed by the Fossil Butte Member.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   AGE OF THE GREEN RIVER FORMATION.\r\n\r\nThe age of the Green River Formation is dated on its intertonguing\r\nrelationships with the Wasatch Formation because the latter has datable\r\nmammal fossils. The well-preserved fossils of fish, leaves, and insects\r\nfrom the Green River are, unfortunately, of little value in dating the\r\nGreen River Formation.\r\n\r\nAlthough no Lostcabinian mammals are known from Fossil Basin, the Green\r\nRiver Formation is believed to be of that age (Gazin 1959; Schaeffer and\r\nMangus 1965).\r\n\r\n\r\n                       DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT.\r\n\r\nThe Green River Formation, on the basis of its lithology and fossil\r\ncontent, is a fresh-water, lacustrine deposit. Clay and silt were dumped\r\nin Fossil Lake by streams. Most of this fine debris was deposited near\r\nthe shore. Chemical and organic processes formed limestones and\r\nmarlstones in the deeper central part of the lake.\r\n\r\nExamination of the edge of the Green River Formation indicates that\r\nFossil Lake expanded and contracted several times.\r\n\r\nFossil Lake was eventually filled in with chemical precipitates and\r\ndeltaic deposits. The end of the lake was gradual as seen in the\r\ntransitional and gradational Green River-Bullpen contact.\r\n\r\nAlthough oil shale is not extensively developed in the Green River\r\nFormation of Fossil Basin, it does occur in small quantities.\r\n\r\n  Oil shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock containing organic matter\r\n  which was derived chiefly from aquatic organisms, waxy spores and\r\n  pollen grains ... and of which a large portion is distillable into a\r\n  liquid similar to petroleum. Despite the name, most rich beds of oil\r\n  shale in the Green River Formation cannot be regarded strictly as\r\n  shale. Instead, they are dolomitic marlstones rich in organic matter.\r\n  Nevertheless, a few are shaly (Bradley 1964b:19).\r\n\r\nOil shale has a structureless ground mass that is yellowish-orange to\r\nreddish-orange in color. Pyrite crystals are found indicating a\r\npartially anaerobic or reducing environment. Pollen, waxy spores,\r\nfilaments of algae, and other plant parts are preserved along with\r\ninsects and larvae. The preservation is akin to mummification. Crystals\r\nof calcite, dolomite, or authigenic feldspar are also found in the oil\r\nshale (Bradley 1966).\r\n\r\nThe exact mode of origin of oil shale is not positively known because of\r\na lack of a modern analogue for comparison. Oil shale probably\r\noriginated as an organic ooze on the bottom of the Fossil Lake. This\r\nooze was composed of the remains of phytoplankton, blue-green algae,\r\nzooplankton, bacteria, and some pollen and spores. The ooze was dense\r\nand uncompacted. Little clastic debris is found, either because the ooze\r\naccumulated in deep water or plants near the shore filtered out the\r\ndebris.\r\n\r\nDecay was reduced effectively in the ooze because of either an\r\nantibiotic in the ooze which inhibited bacteria of decay or the ooze\r\naccumulated in waters where anaerobic conditions prevented decay.\r\n\r\nWith time and the weight of overlying sediments, the ooze was compacted\r\nand most of its water driven off. Continuing pressure from compaction\r\nand heat generated by burial and compaction caused a variety of complex\r\nchemical reactions which converted the ooze into a petroleum product\r\ncalled kerogen. Kerogen is distillable and is the important constituent\r\nof oil shale.\r\n\r\nAn alternate hypothesis (Eugster and Surdam 1973), would have some oil\r\nshale forming in a desert-playa environment. This is based on\r\ngeochemical evidence found in Gosiute Lake sediments to the east of\r\nFossil Lake. There, certain minerals are found in association with some\r\noil shale that could only have been deposited during periods of extreme\r\nevaporation and in a shallow lake. Much study is now being directed\r\ntoward a solution to these problems.\r\n\r\nThe combustible quality of oil shale has been known for a long time.\r\nMany of the pioneers used it as a fuel for cooking and heat. Hayden\r\n(1871:142) wrote of how workmen on the Union Pacific accidently ignited\r\nthe oil shale in a cut they were excavating. The burning shale provided\r\nenough light for night work.\r\n\r\nMany of the shales of the Green River Formation appear to be varved. A\r\nvarve consists of two layers, one of calcium or magnesium carbonate and\r\none of organic material. The limnological conditions that led to the\r\nformation of varves will be discussed in their proper place in the\r\nsection on Paleoecology.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Fowkes Formation\r\n\r\nThis is the middle formation of Veatch’s (1907) tripartite division of\r\nthe Wasatch Group. It is now found to be the youngest formation in\r\nFossil Basin. It is not exposed in Fossil Butte National Monument.\r\n\r\nOriel and Tracey (1970) have formally divided and named three members of\r\nthe Fowkes Formation: a lower Sillem Member, a middle Bulldog Hollow\r\nMember, and an upper Gooseberry Member.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SILLEM MEMBER.\r\n\r\nLike most of the Fowkes Formation, this sequence of rocks has been\r\neroded extensively and is preserved as erosional remnants, where\r\nprotected by faulting, in the western part of Fossil Basin.\r\n\r\nThe Sillem Member consists of a lower conglomeratic sequence with some\r\nsandstone and mudstone. The conglomerate contains well-rounded clasts of\r\ngray quartzite, chert, and Paleozoic limestone. The sandstone is light\r\ngray, calcareous to muddy, and coarse to medium-grained. The mudstone is\r\npink, gray, or tan in color.\r\n\r\nThe upper part of the Sillem Member is a mudstone and claystone unit. It\r\nranges in color from pink and yellow to gray and green. Some volcanic\r\ndebris is found. There are also interbedded layers of marlstone and\r\nlimestone. Some sandstone is present.\r\n\r\nThe Sillem Member is between 100 and 400 ft thick and most probably\r\nrests unconformably on the Bullpen Member of the Wasatch.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BULLDOG HOLLOW MEMBER.\r\n\r\nThis middle member of the Fowkes Formation has the thickest and most\r\nextensive outcrops. The Bulldog Hollow Member is exposed along the west\r\nside of the basin.\r\n\r\nIncluded rocks are green, white, and blue-green mudstone with ash beds,\r\ngreen and buff claystone, and tuffaceous, limy sandstone. A high\r\npercentage of the iron mineral, magnetite, occurs in the sandstone.\r\nConglomerate occurs as lenses.\r\n\r\nThe Bulldog Hollow Member has a gradational contact with the underlying\r\nSillem Member. The amount of volcanic material increases upward from the\r\nSillem, indicating an increase in volcanic activity during the\r\ndeposition of the Bulldog Hollow Member.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           GOOSEBERRY MEMBER.\r\n\r\nOriel and Tracey (1970:55) place this uppermost member provisionally\r\nwithin the Fowkes Formation. Most of the Gooseberry Member is a\r\npuddingstone, a lithology with well-rounded, spherical pebbles in a\r\nmarlstone, sandstone, or sandy limestone matrix. The pebbles are too\r\nrounded for the rock to be a diamictite, and too separated from each\r\nother to be called a conglomerate.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the Gooseberry-Bulldog Hollow contact is not completely\r\nknown. It appears to be gradational in some areas and to be an angular\r\nunconformity in others.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        AGE OF FOWKES FORMATION.\r\n\r\nFossils date the Sillem and Bulldog Hollow members as middle Eocene in\r\nage. These fossils consist of ostracodes, gastropods, leaves, and\r\nvertebrates from the Bulldog Hollow Member (Nelson 1973). The Gooseberry\r\nMember has yielded a few vertebrate remains and is late Miocene or early\r\nPliocene in age (Oriel and Tracey 1970).\r\n\r\n\r\n                       DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT.\r\n\r\nThe Fowkes Formation is an alluvial deposit, much like the Wasatch\r\nFormation. The chemical and climatic conditions of deposition were\r\ndifferent from those of the Wasatch, and the extensive red-beds are not\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nSmall lakes were present in which limestone and marlstone accumulated.\r\nThe puddingstone may be a mudflow. Volcanic activity left its record in\r\nthe ash found in the Fowkes Formation.\r\n\r\nIn the past, the Fowkes Formation had a greater distribution.\r\nPostdepositional faulting down dropped parts of the Fowkes protecting\r\nthem from subsequent erosion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               QUATERNARY\r\n\r\n\r\nRubey et al. (1968a, b) have mapped several forms of Quaternary deposits\r\nin Fossil Basin. These include stream alluvium, rock and landslide\r\ndebris, river terraces, and gravels, all derived from local formations.\r\nThese deposits are the work of water, wind, and ice acting in relatively\r\nRecent time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE GEOLOGIC STRUCTURE OF FOSSIL BASIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fossil Basin is a small, linear and structurally controlled basin in\r\nthe southeastern part of the Wyoming overthrust belt. This “overthrust\r\nbelt” is represented by a number of small mountain ranges and high\r\nridges formed by the “thrusting” of sedimentary rocks over other\r\nsedimentary rocks. Topographically, the Fossil Basin is bounded by the\r\nCrawford Mountains and Tunp Range on the west, by Oyster Ridge on the\r\neast, and by the Uinta Mountains on the south. The Crawford Mountains,\r\nTunp Range, and Oyster Ridge (Fig. 2) are areas of high relief developed\r\nupon southerly extended salient ridges of deformed Paleozoic and\r\nMesozoic strata. In the center of the Fossil Basin, these earlier rocks\r\nare covered by a veneer of early Tertiary sediments. Superficially, the\r\nFossil Basin appears to be a broad syncline with tilted beds dipping\r\nsharply or gently basinward from the basin margins. The Tertiary\r\nsedimentary cover, however, partially obscures what is a more complex\r\nstructural history.\r\n\r\nFollowing deposition of the Late Cretaceous Adaville Formation, the\r\nFossil Basin was included in a period of intense structural deformation.\r\nThis deformation was the result of compressional forces acting along a\r\nmore or less east-west alignment. The strain, or the resolution of these\r\nforces, was developed along a north-south alignment or perpendicular to\r\nthe compressional forces. As the stress level became too great, the\r\nrocks were first folded and then faulted. Initial faulting of the rocks\r\nrelieved some of the stress; however, with continued application of\r\ncompressive forces many stages of folding and faulting were generated.\r\nBecause the alignment of the compressive forces remained about the same\r\nthroughout deformation (i.e., east-west) and because the strongest\r\nrelative compressive forces were from the west, successively younger\r\nfolds and faults were generated in an eastward direction.\r\n\r\nThe structural evolution of the Fossil Butte area may be interpreted as\r\nfollows from the schematic diagrams:\r\n\r\n  1. The Rock Creek-Needles Anticline is developed at the western edge\r\n  of the Fossil Basin. The present topographic highs developed on this\r\n  structure are the Crawford Mountains and Tunp Range (Fig. 9-B).\r\n\r\n  2. With continued application of compressional forces, Paleozoic and\r\n  Mesozoic rocks to the east of the Rock Creek-Needles Anticline are\r\n  folded (Fig. 9-C).\r\n\r\n  3. The fold becomes sharply asymmetrical and when the rocks can no\r\n  longer accommodate the compressional forces by further folding, a\r\n  low-angle fault is developed (Absaroka thrust fault). This fault\r\n  probably began as a fracture parallel to bedding which rose to\r\n  topographic surface at a low angle at the point of greatest strain in\r\n  the fold. Most likely, this fracture was an eastward extension of the\r\n  fault underlying the Rock Creek-Needles Anticline, as depicted in Fig.\r\n  9-D.\r\n\r\n  4. The rocks to the west of the newly developed fault overrode those\r\n  to the east. This was accompanied by further downwarping in the\r\n  syncline to the east of the fault and the erosion of uplifted\r\n  sedimentary rocks on the west side of the fault (Fig. 9-E).\r\n\r\n  5. Another cycle of folding and faulting was initiated to the east of\r\n  the Absaroka fault. This post-Absaroka deformation instigated further\r\n  downwarping of the Fossil Basin area between the Tunp-Crawford\r\n  Mountains and Oyster Ridge. Tertiary sediments began to accumulate in\r\n  the Fossil Basin (Fig. 9-F).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 9.

Simplified structure section through present-day\r\n    Fossil Basin\r\n    (Oyster Ridge is off the diagram to the East)\r\n    Structural interpretation by Dr. D.L. Blackstone]\r\n\r\nIn early Eocene times, the effects of continued downwarping allowed\r\nFossil Lake to form in the Fossil Basin. By the late Eocene, however,\r\nbasinal subsidence could no longer keep pace with deposition and the\r\ndominantly lacustrine (lake) sedimentation was replaced by a fluviatile\r\n(riverine) sedimentary regime. Deposition of fluviatile sediments\r\nprobably continued into the later Tertiary when, in the late Pliocene,\r\nregional uplift of the Rocky Mountain interior reversed the sedimentary\r\ncycle from depositional to erosional. The last 3 or 4 million years of\r\ngeologic history have witnessed the excavation of much of the Tertiary\r\nsedimentary fill from the Fossil Basin. Fossil Butte and the Ham’s Fork\r\nPlateau to the northeast of the butte are high erosional remnants of\r\nthis early Tertiary basin fill. The traces of the Absaroka and other\r\nthrust faults are buried beneath these remaining Tertiary deposits in\r\nthe Fossil Basin.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile most of this complex structural history took place before the\r\nTertiary sediments were deposited, some deformation continued into the\r\nearly Eocene. Near Prow Point, for example, is a fault that developed\r\nduring early Eocene time. This can be noted in the very northwest corner\r\nof the monument, just to the west of Prow Point (Fig. 6). Here, the\r\nLower Member of the Wasatch Formation on the west is faulted against the\r\nMain Body on the east (USDI 1964). This fault also is responsible for\r\nelevating the Thaynes Limestone so it is exposed (Fig. 10).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 10. Structural relation of older rocks to\r\n    Wasatch and Green River formations near Prow Point in the northwest\r\n    corner of the monument (from U.S. Department of Interior 1964).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PALEONTOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nFossils of plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates are abundant in rocks\r\nexposed in the Fossil Basin. For example, Oyster Ridge received its name\r\nbecause of the well-preserved and abundant fossil oysters found there.\r\nOf course, Fossil Butte and Fossil Butte National Monument were so named\r\nbecause of the beautifully preserved fossil fish. A brief review of the\r\nmain groups of fossils to be found in the basin follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Flora\r\n\r\nMany of the sediments in the Fossil Basin contain an abundance of fossil\r\nplants. These consist of pollen, spores, wood, and leaf impressions.\r\nThose of the Green River Formation are best preserved and have received\r\nthe most study.\r\n\r\nBrown (1929, 1934) and Lesquereux (1883) have presented the best\r\ninformation on the flora of the Green River Formation. Much of the\r\npresent knowledge is based on their work.\r\n\r\nBrown (1929, 1934) concluded that the Green River flora is a mixed\r\nforest type. It contains some plants common to warm, wet lowlands and\r\nothers adapted to cooler, drier uplands. Pollen studies support Brown’s\r\noriginal concept that several plant communities, including mountain\r\ncommunities, existed around Fossil Lake.\r\n\r\nThe flora was situated in an inland, mountain basin. Fossil Lake was in\r\nthe middle of the basin. Swamps and flood plains bordered the lake,\r\nwhile the flanking ridges and mountains provided altitudinal variations\r\nin the plant assemblage.\r\n\r\nSpruce, fir, and pine are indicated by fossil pollen. The presence of\r\nthese conifers suggest that at least some of the nearby mountains rose\r\nto heights of 6000-8000 ft.\r\n\r\nLeaf imprints indicate that deciduous trees occurred on the lower\r\nslopes. Oak, elm, maple, and beech were common forms.\r\n\r\nCloser to the lake where it was wetter and warmer there were willows,\r\nlaurel, and fig trees. Palms grew in the sandier soils (Fig. 11).\r\nCypress grew in quiet embayments of Fossil Lake. The shoreline plant\r\nassemblage had a rather subtropical appearance.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 11. Impression of a palm frond from the fish\r\n    beds of Fossil Basin. Width of original, 160 mm. _Collection of\r\n    University of Wyoming._]\r\n\r\nGround cover was provided by a mold of dead leaves, holly, liverworts,\r\nmosses, and ferns (Fig. 12). Prairie-type grasses are not present and\r\nlarge savanna areas probably were not developed.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 12. A fern leaf from the Green River Shales of\r\n    the Green River Basin. Width of original, 4 cm. _Collection of\r\n    University of Wyoming._]\r\n\r\nIn the lake itself small, one-celled algae floated about in the waves\r\nand currents. Bacteria grew on the lake bottom and in the water and\r\nhelped to contribute to the organic ooze that built up on the bottom.\r\nFungi, wonderfully preserved in oil shales, are further indicators that\r\nFossil Lake was a fresh-water lake and deep enough to have depths below\r\nthe zone of sunlight penetration (Bradley 1964a). Reeds, rushes, and\r\nsimilar lake-shore plants grew in shallow, near-shore waters.\r\n\r\nThe large amount of organic material in the rocks is evidence of the\r\nprolific microscopic plant growth in the lake.\r\n\r\nOccasional dry periods in the Fossil Basin are indicated by fossils of a\r\nplant called _Ephedra_. This plant had leaves with a thick, waxy cuticle\r\nto prevent desiccation during drought. The absence of saline minerals in\r\nthe Green River Formation in Fossil Basin suggests that these arid\r\nperiods were never of the intensity that occurred in the Green River\r\nBasin to the east.\r\n\r\nThe flora of Fossil Basin, especially that from the Green River\r\nFormation, is usually compared to that of the present-day Gulf Coast.\r\nSeaward from the Appalachians, the composition of the flora is very\r\nsimilar to that of the Green River. Spruce, pine, and fir grow in the\r\nAppalachians at elevations of 6000 or more feet, supporting the idea\r\nthat similar elevations existed near Fossil Lake and that a general Gulf\r\nCoast climate prevailed in Fossil Basin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Invertebrates\r\n\r\nMolluscs, ostracodes, and insects comprise the invertebrate fauna of\r\nFossil Basin.\r\n\r\nA large number of marine forms are found in the earlier marine deposits,\r\nwhile fresh-water and terrestrial forms are common in the Tertiary\r\nunits. It is these later forms which are considered here.\r\n\r\nThe fresh-water and terrestrial molluscs from the Wasatch and Green\r\nRiver formations include bivalves (clams) and gastropods (snails).\r\n\r\nAquatic clams from the Green River Formation include _Unio_ and\r\n_Plesiellipta_. _Pisidium_ and _Sphaerium_ are common in the Wasatch\r\nFormation.\r\n\r\nLand snails from the Wasatch include such genera as _Grangerella_,\r\n_Discus_, _Oreoconus_, and _Glypterpres_. _Oreoconus_ is also known from\r\nthe Green River Formation.\r\n\r\nFresh-water snails are very abundant from both the Wasatch and Green\r\nRiver formations. _Physa_, _Planorbis_, _Elimia_, _Bioniphalaria_,\r\n_Virpains_, and _Omalodiscus_ are from the Wasatch. _Physa_, _Elimia_,\r\n_Diomphalaria_, and _Goniobasis_ are recorded from the lacustrine Green\r\nRiver sediments. In some areas of the Green River Formation, these snail\r\nfossils are so abundant that they form a major constituent of the\r\nlimestones. The presence of land snails in the Green River and\r\nfresh-water molluscs in the Wasatch is evidence that the two formations\r\nare not totally representative of a single environment, but represent\r\nseveral related ones.\r\n\r\nMost of these fresh-water snails were herbivorous and frequented the\r\nshallow, well-lighted areas of Fossil Lake which had a good growth of\r\nplants and algae. This naturally occurred close to shore, hence the\r\ngastropodal limestones reported by Bradley (1926) and Oriel and Tracey\r\n(1970) are interpreted as being near-shore facies.\r\n\r\nOstracodes are extremely small arthropods that produce a two-piece,\r\nhinged shell within which they live. _Pseudocypus_ is the most common\r\nform. Like the snails, the ostracodes were so abundant in areas that\r\nthey, too, formed a large part of some Green River Formation limestones.\r\nAnd like the snails they lived in a near-shore environment.\r\n\r\nWithin the laminated shales of the Green River Formation is preserved an\r\nabundant and diverse assemblage of fossil insects (Fig. 13).\r\n\r\nThese insects are important because they demonstrate that many modern\r\nfamilies and even genera were in existence during the Eocene. In\r\ncontrast to this, knowledge of insect evolution prior to the Eocene is\r\nrather poorly known. Scudder (1890) and Cockerell (1920) have described\r\nmost of the Green River insects.\r\n\r\nBeetles are the most common forms, followed by dragonflies. Maggots and\r\nlarvae of flies are commonly preserved.\r\n\r\nExcept for these insects preserved as whole \"mummies\" in the oil shales,\r\nthe majority of the insect fossils are preserved as distilled outlines.\r\nThis distillation process resulted from the weight and heat of overlying\r\nsediments of driving off the volatile substances from the buried\r\ninsects, leaving a hydrocarbon outline. The process is so precise that\r\nthe fine hairs and wing veins and even body-color markings are\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 13.

Most of the fish are perfectly\r\npreserved, retaining every detail of the skeleton and even undisturbed\r\nscales. Fish from Fossil Butte have been collected and sold since the\r\n1870s and may be found on sales counters, in museums, and on living room\r\nwalls throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe fossil fish from the Green River Formation have a history of\r\ndiscovery stretching back to 1856. At that time Leidy (1856:256)\r\ndescribed a fish given to him by a Dr. John Evans. Leidy called the fish\r\n_Clupea humilis_, a type of herring. Exactly where Dr. Evans obtained\r\nthe specimen is not known. He passed through the area of the Green River\r\nFormation several times and could have collected it during any one of\r\nthose trips (Knight 1955:12).\r\n\r\nDuring the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad in the 1860s,\r\nworkmen blasting a cut through Green River shales, about 2 miles west of\r\nGreen River, Wyoming, came upon remains of well-preserved fish. Hayden\r\n(1871:742) first mentions this cut as \"Petrified Fish Cut.\" Many of the\r\nfish from this cut were given to Cope who described them in Hayden’s\r\n(1871) report. Insects, plants, and a bird feather were also obtained\r\nfrom \"Petrified Fish Cut\" at this time.\r\n\r\nSometime in the 1870s the first fish were obtained from Fossil Butte\r\nitself. Cope (1877, 1878) described fish from the Green River Formation\r\nwhich may be from Fossil Butte. His locality is \"nearer the mainline of\r\nWasatch Mountains\" (Cope 1877:807). This may be Fossil Butte. His 1878\r\nlocality information is just as poor. He does mention a specimen of\r\n_Priscacara peali_ given to him by A. C. Peale. Since it was Peale who\r\nfirst wrote about Fossil Butte, the specimen may have come from the\r\nbutte.\r\n\r\nPeale (1879) first mentioned the quarrying of fish at Fossil Butte, but\r\nhe had no specific date as to the discovery of the butte or the\r\nbeginning of quarrying of fish.\r\n\r\nCope (1884) published two large volumes about the Tertiary vertebrates\r\nof the West. Here he mentioned three fossil localities for his Green\r\nRiver Fish: \"Petrified Fish Cut,\" \"The Mouth of Labarge Creek,\" and\r\n\"Twin Creek.\" Twin Creek is now known as the Fossil Butte site.\r\n\r\nSince that time, the quarries at Fossil Butte have been extensively\r\nworked, mostly by commercial collectors.\r\n\r\nThe fish from Fossil Butte form an unusual array of genera (Table 1)\r\nunlike any now found living together. Included in the assemblage are\r\nforms usually found in marine waters and tropical, fresh-water fish\r\n(Schaeffer and Mangus 1965).\r\n\r\n    TABLE 1. _Simplified classification of fish from Fossil Basin._\r\n\r\n\r\n  Elasmobranchii\r\n    Trygonidae\r\n      _Xiphotrygon_ (sting ray)\r\n  Chondrostei\r\n    Polyodontidae\r\n      _Polyodon_ (paddle fish)\r\n  Holostei\r\n    Lepisosteidae\r\n      _Lepisosteus_ (gar)\r\n    Amiidae\r\n      _Amia_ (bowfin)\r\n  Isospondyli\r\n    Osteoglossidae\r\n      _Phareodus_\r\n    Gonorhynchidae\r\n      _Notogoneus_ (sand fish)\r\n    Clupeidae\r\n      _Diplomystus_ (herrings, shad)\r\n      _Knightia_\r\n  Ostariophysi\r\n    Siluridae\r\n      _Ameiurus_ (catfish)\r\n  Xenarchi\r\n    Aphredoderidae (pirate perches)\r\n      _Erismatopterus_\r\n    Asineopidae\r\n      _Asineops_\r\n  Acanthoptergii\r\n    Percidae\r\n      _Mioplosus_ (perches)\r\n    Serronidae\r\n      _Priscacara_\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than 40 species of fish have been described from the Green River\r\nshales, but authorities do not agree on how many of these are valid.\r\nBecause of this, only super specific groups will be considered in the\r\nfollowing discussion.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 14. _Xiphotrygon_, a fossil ray. These forms are\r\n    present but rather rare in the fish deposits of Fossil Butte. Length\r\n    of original, 39 cm. _Collection of University of Wyoming._]\r\n\r\nOne of the strangest forms to come from Fossil Butte is that of\r\n_Xiphotrygon_ (Fig. 14). This is not a true fish, but is a sting ray,\r\nrelated to sharks. Closely related forms still survive, with little\r\nchange, in coastal waters in many parts of the world. Like sharks, sting\r\nrays have a skeleton composed of cartilage. Normally, cartilage is not\r\npreserved as a fossil as it disintegrates readily. The excellent\r\nskeletons of _Xiphotrygon_ are good evidence of how well the shales of\r\nthe Green River Formation preserve the fossils. _Xiphotrygon_ is\r\ncharacterized by being shortened from back to front and flattened from\r\ntop to bottom. It possesses a long, whip-like tail and bears enormous,\r\nflat pectoral (anterior) fins. The mouth is on the underside of the body\r\nindicating that _Xiphotrygon_, like its modern relatives, fed along the\r\nbottom of the lake. The strong flattened teeth form something like a\r\npavement in the mouth, suggesting that it fed on clams and other\r\nhard-shelled invertebrates. Close relatives of _Xiphotrygon_ live mostly\r\nin marine waters, but occasionally enter fresh water.\r\n\r\nThe paddlefish, _Polyodon_, is rare but present at Fossil Butte. Similar\r\nforms still survive in China and the United States. The prominent\r\nfeatures of _Polyodon_ include a virtually scaleless body, a long,\r\ndepressed snout, and long gill rakers. The skeleton, unlike that of most\r\nmodern fish, is composed of cartilage, hence skeletons of _Polyodon_ are\r\nrare. The difference between the modern and Eocene paddlefish are so\r\nslight that the two probably filled similar or the same ecologic niches.\r\nThis consists of feeding on plankton and other small organisms which can\r\nbe obtained from the water. The long gill rakers would provide a large\r\nsurface area on which food could be trapped as the water passed out\r\nthrough the gill slits. The large mouth would also provide a large\r\nsurface area for catching and trapping food.\r\n\r\nQuite common to streams and rivers of North America from the Cretaceous\r\nto the Recent is the garfish, _Lepisosteus_ (Fig. 15). The most striking\r\nfeature of the gar is its diamond-shaped scales, which are extremely\r\nhard and shiny. The body is long, essentially of the same depth\r\nthroughout, and ending in a broad-based tail that is slightly\r\nasymmetrical. The mouth is armed with many small, sharp teeth for\r\ncatching prey. One specimen over 5 ft long has been found in the Fossil\r\nButte area.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 15. The fossil gar _Lepisosteus_. Only a few gar\r\n    have been found at Fossil Butte itself. Length of original, 70 cm.\r\n    Across the highway from the butte, one specimen over 5 ft long was\r\n    found by Carl Ulrich. _Collection of University of Wyoming._]\r\n\r\nFossils of the bowfin _Amia_ (Fig. 16) are recorded from the Green River\r\nshales at Fossil Butte and in stream deposits from Cretaceous to Recent.\r\nThis fish is still another “living fossil.” _Amia_ is a nocturnal\r\npredator. Presumably, the Eocene _Amia_ had similar habits. The body in\r\n_Amia_ has become elongate, as has the dorsal fin. The thickness of the\r\nscales has been reduced, but they are still rather heavy and cover the\r\nbody. Specimens are rather large and deep-bodied. The tail fin is nearly\r\nsymmetrical above and below. _Amia_ is rare in the Fossil Butte fish\r\nquarries.\r\n\r\nBy far the most abundant fish from Fossil Butte is the genus _Knightia_\r\n(Fig. 17, 18). This fish is a member of the Clupeidae, a family that\r\nincludes modern herrings, shad, and sardines. The tail fin is small\r\nrelative to the rest of the body. A row of modified scales extends on\r\nthe back from the skull to the dorsal fin. Possibly they aided in\r\nstreamlining the fish. _Knightia_ apparently fed on the large amounts of\r\nplankton, especially algae, which lived in the waters of Fossil Lake.\r\nFossils of _Knightia_ are also known from Eocene lake sediments in South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n_Knightia_ appears to have been susceptible to mass mortalities. Some\r\nlayers of shale at Fossil Butte contain literally hundreds of thousands\r\nof these fish that must have suffered catastrophic mass mortality.\r\nPossible reasons for the obvious sudden death of so many fish will be\r\ndiscussed in the section on paleoenvironment and taphonomy.\r\n\r\nAnother Eocene relative of the herring found at Fossil Butte is\r\n_Diplomystus_ (Fig. 19, 20). Like _Knightia_, _Diplomystus_ bears a row\r\nof modified scales on its back. _Diplomystus_ is the second most\r\nabundant fish at Fossil Butte. The jaw in _Diplomystus_ has a rather\r\npronounced oblique angle to it. The deepest portion of the body is\r\ndirectly behind the gill region, with a continuous narrowing of the body\r\ntoward the tail region. _Diplomystus_ is known from Cretaceous rocks of\r\nBrazil and Syria and from Tertiary sediments in Brazil and West Africa\r\n(Schaeffer and Mangus 1965). Close relatives of _Diplomystus_ now\r\ninhabit the waters off the coasts of Peru and eastern Australia.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 16. _Amia_, the bowfin.

Length of _Diplomystus_, 45 cm. _Collection of\r\n    University of Wyoming._]\r\n\r\n_Phareodus_ (Fig. 21) belongs to a family of fish, the Osteoglossidae,\r\nwhich began as marine forms and has since become a fresh-water family.\r\nAt present, they are restricted to tropical rivers and lakes of South\r\nAmerica, Africa, and Australia. In the past they had a much greater\r\ndistribution, as its occurrence at Fossil Butte indicates, including\r\nNorth America. It is a deep-bodied fish with a large head. The anal and\r\ndorsal fins are close to the tail fins. The many sharp teeth in the\r\nmouth attest to the carnivorous habits of _Phareodus_.\r\n\r\nThe family Gonorhynchidae, the living sandfish of the Indo-Pacific area,\r\nis represented at Fossil Butte by _Notogoneus_ (Fig. 22). _Notogoneus_\r\nis very long-bodied and quite slender. The body width does not vary much\r\nfrom head to tail, although narrowing does occur in the tail region. The\r\ntail fin is symmetrical, forming a good rudder. The anal, dorsal,\r\npectoral, and pelvic fins are all small. The body is covered with small,\r\nelongate scales. _Notogoneus_ was apparently a bottom feeder, living on\r\nsmall organisms picked off or out of the bottom of Fossil Lake.\r\n\r\nThe Recent catfish, _Ameuirus_, has also been found at Fossil Butte in\r\nthe Green River shales. The form of the Eocene catfish was very much\r\nlike the Recent one. The habits of the Eocene catfish were probably like\r\nthose of the modern _Ameuirus_, i.e., adaptations to a scavenger-type\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nRather common in the sediments of Lake Gosiute, but not yet known from\r\nthe Fossil Basin, is _Erismatopterus_, a member of the family\r\nAphredederidae or pirate perches. This small, elongate fish has few\r\ndistinguishing characters, the rounded front edge of the skull being\r\nmost distinguishable.\r\n\r\n_Asineops_ is an Eocene relative of _Erismatopterus_ and also one of the\r\npirate perches. _Asineops_ is, however, placed in a different family,\r\nthe Asineopidae. _Asineops_, like _Erismatopterus_, is a rather\r\nplain-looking fish. The dorsal fin is long relative to the rest of the\r\nbody. The body is slightly deeper behind the gills than elsewhere,\r\ngiving _Asineops_ a rather common appearance.\r\n\r\nThe Percidae, or perches, are represented at Fossil Butte by _Mioplosus_\r\n(Fig. 23). _Mioplosus_, as indicated by its well-developed teeth, was a\r\ncarnivore that probably preyed on its piscine relatives in Fossil Lake.\r\nThe large head blends in well with a strongly built, long body. The anal\r\nand dorsal fins are subequal in size and positioned opposite each other.\r\nThe tail fin is large and fan-shaped. It is easily identified by the\r\npresence of two dorsal fins.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 21. A large _Phareodus_, fairly common in the\r\n    Fossil Butte fish beds. Length of original, 54 cm. _Collection of\r\n    University of Wyoming._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 22. _Notogoneus_, a long, slender bottom-feeder,\r\n    occasionally found at Fossil Butte.

Length of original, 30 cm. _Collection of American\r\n    Museum of Natural History._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 24. _Priscacara_, a small bass that is common in\r\n    the Fossil Butte fish beds. Length of original, 13 cm. _Collection\r\n    of University of Wyoming._]\r\n\r\nThe one genus for which no close living relatives can be found is\r\n_Priscacara_ (Fig. 24). The family Priscacaridae is thought to be\r\nrelated to the bass. The family is known only from the Eocene. The size\r\nof _Priscacara_ is extremely variable. The body is deep and nearly round\r\nlike that of the common sunfish, the head blending in well with the body\r\nand its contours. The most distinguishing feature of _Priscacara_ is the\r\nseries of strong, stout spines supporting the anal and dorsal fins.\r\nThese spines may have acted as cut-waters for better swimming and/or\r\nthey may have protected _Priscacara_ from its more voracious relatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              AMPHIBIANS.\r\n\r\nTo date, no amphibian fossils are known from Fossil Butte. They must\r\nhave been present, as this class of animals is recorded from Devonian\r\nrocks more than 350 million years old and from rocks younger than those\r\nat Fossil Butte. Living amphibians are typified by frogs, toads, and\r\nsalamanders. The lack of amphibian remains at Fossil Butte is more\r\nlikely due to nondiscovery than nonexistence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               REPTILES.\r\n\r\nReptile fossils are very abundant in the Green River and Wasatch\r\nformations. Also a jaw of the three-horned _Triceratops_ is known from\r\nthe Cretaceous part of the Evanston Formation.\r\n\r\nSmall lizards are normally represented only by jaw fragments and\r\nvertebrae. Their remains are most often found by a process of washing\r\nand screening of the sediments containing the fossils. Snakes are also\r\nrepresented in the Green River Formation. Remains of these animals are\r\nalso often restricted to jaws and vertebrae. A complete skeleton of a\r\nfossil boa, _Boavus idelmani_, has been recovered from the Green River\r\nFormation and is the most complete fossil snake from North America\r\n(Schaeffer and Mangus 1965).\r\n\r\nTurtles are among the most abundant reptile fossils. They are usually\r\nfound as isolated shell plates, although many complete shells are known.\r\nThe turtles _Trionyx_ (Fig. 25), _Emys_, _Baena_, and _Notomorpha_ are\r\nknown from the Fossil Basin.\r\n\r\nThe largest Eocene reptiles were the crocodiles (Fig. 26). The presence\r\nof these predaceous animals is further evidence for a prevailing warm\r\nand humid climate during the Eocene times since their tolerance ranges\r\ninclude only comparable conditions at the present time. A few incomplete\r\nspecimens have been recovered from near the monument.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 BIRDS.\r\n\r\nBirds, which first appeared in Jurassic time, are rare as fossils in\r\nrocks of any age because their skeletal remains are exceedingly fragile.\r\nTheir fossilization requires special conditions because many of their\r\nbones are hollow as a weight-reducing adaptation for flight. These\r\nhollow bones are especially susceptible to breakage and poor\r\npreservation. Scattered remains of birds, mostly limb bones, are found\r\nin the Green River sediments. Feather imprints have also been recovered.\r\nA complete skeleton of _Gallinuloides_, a bird related to the South\r\nAmerican fowl-like chachalaca, is one of the most significant finds from\r\nthe Green River Formation. Recently, Brodkorb (1970) described the wings\r\nof puff birds similar to those now living in South America from near\r\nFossil Butte.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 25. An aquatic turtle, _Trionyx_, from the\r\n    shore-line deposits of Lake Gosiute. Several turtles have been found\r\n    in the fish beds near Fossil Butte.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 26. The skull of a large crocodile from near the\r\n    shoreline of Lake Gosiute. Several crocodile fragments have been\r\n    found at Fossil Butte beds. Length of original, 75 cm. _Collection\r\n    of University of Wyoming._]\r\n\r\nIn the adjacent Green River Basin to the east, paleontologists from the\r\nUniversity of Wyoming have found nesting grounds of Eocene flamingos in\r\nslightly younger sediments of the Green River Formation. These\r\n“rookeries” have yielded many hundreds of fossil bones of this curious\r\nbird. Since these bird fossils were found proximal to Fossil Butte, they\r\ndemonstrate the near subtropical nature of the environment in the Fossil\r\nButte area in Green River times.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                MAMMALS.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of the Evanston, Wasatch, and Fowkes formations contain\r\nvarious fossilized remains of mammals which once inhabited the Fossil\r\nBasin.\r\n\r\nMammal fossils are highly significant since they are used extensively\r\nfor correlation and dating of the Tertiary rocks of the West. Fossils\r\nwhich are readily recognizable, limited in time, and widely distributed\r\ngeographically are called “index fossils.” These fossils are restricted\r\nto a particular time horizon in the rock. In this way, rocks of unknown\r\nage which are found to contain index fossils can be dated relatively and\r\nhence correlated with other fossil-bearing rocks. The small condylarth\r\n_Haplomylus_ (Fig. 27) is a very early Eocene index fossil. Its presence\r\nin certain sediments in the Fossil Basin shows conclusively that these\r\nsediments were laid down in earliest Eocene times.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 27. A jaw of the primitive mammal _Haplomylus_.\r\n    Length of original, 1.3 cm. _Collection of University of Wyoming._]\r\n\r\nThe mammal fossils found in Fossil Basin are also important in\r\ndocumenting the temporal changes in evolution and environment of the\r\nbiotic community. The picture of Eocene Wyoming drawn through\r\ninterpretation of these fossils is vastly different than that of the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nMammals have a long evolutionary history that began over 200 million\r\nyears ago in the Triassic period. At that time mammals had only just\r\nevolved from their reptilian ancestors. These earliest mammals were\r\nsmall, furtive creatures. However, with the extinction of the dinosaurs\r\nsome 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous, the mammals were\r\nable to diversify rapidly and fill the empty ecologic niches that the\r\ndinosaurs once occupied.\r\n\r\nThis filling of ecologic niches voided by the dinosaurs coupled with the\r\nspreading of mammals into hitherto unoccupied niches resulted in the\r\ndevelopment of a large variety of mammals. Some became extinct, others\r\nwere the ancestors of modern mammals. Fossils of mammals found in\r\nsediments in the Fossil Basin are proof of the extent of this Late\r\nCretaceous-early Tertiary mammal radiation.\r\n\r\nEarly mammals bore little resemblance to their later descendants.\r\nGeneral trends in mammalian evolution were increase in size and the\r\ntendency to become more “modern”-looking through adaptation to changing\r\nTertiary environments.\r\n\r\nMost mammal fossils are extremely fragmentary. Teeth are most often\r\npreserved as they are the hardest part of the skeleton and therefore\r\nmost resistant to wear and breakage. Thus, it often happens that the\r\nknowledge of a particular fossil mammal is derived entirely from its\r\npreserved dentition. This has obvious limitations for the completeness\r\nof our understanding about mammals in question.\r\n\r\nThe Paleocene portion of the Evanston Formation has yielded mammals of\r\nTorrejonian and Tiffanian age (Fig. 6).\r\n\r\nThe Torrejonian assemblage (middle Paleocene) (Gazin 1969) is small and\r\npoorly preserved. Its main significance is that the fauna records a\r\ndefinite time interval for the Evanston Formation. Gazin’s work has\r\ndemonstrated this fauna to be intermediate in composition between\r\nsimilarly aged faunas recovered from sites to the north and south.\r\n\r\nThe major faunal elements are insectivores, primates, condylarths\r\n(primitive ungulates), and multituberculates (a type of extinct\r\nrodent-like mammal, with no known descendants).\r\n\r\nThe poorly preserved condition of these fossils makes discussion\r\nimpossible except to note that they extend the known time range of\r\nmammalian habitation in the Fossil Basin.\r\n\r\nThe younger Tiffanian fauna (late Paleocene) (Gazin 1956) is also known\r\nfrom largely fragmentary remains. The multituberculate mammal\r\n_Ptilodus_, also present in Torrejonian deposits, is the most\r\n“primitive” mammal in the fauna. The multituberculates first appeared in\r\nthe Jurassic (Fig. 4), and are therefore the oldest lineage of mammals\r\nthat survived into Tertiary times. The molar teeth of these animals are\r\ncharacterized by multiple cusps arranged in parallel rows. _Ptilodus_,\r\nlike most other multituberculates, was specialized in that its fourth\r\nlower premolars were expanded into shearing blades, the function of\r\nwhich is not known. _Ptilodus_ was in many respects similar to rodents\r\nin the development of procumbant incisors and in general build and\r\nappearance. Multituberculates are, however, not related to rodents\r\nexcept that both are mammals. The differentiation of rodents in the late\r\nPaleocene and their diversification during the Eocene probably presented\r\nstrong competition for the multituberculates who were unable to compete\r\nsuccessfully and so became extinct.\r\n\r\nThe primates were represented by _Plesiadapsis_. This animal was about\r\nthe size of a squirrel and had chisel-like incisors. Flesh\r\nreconstructions of _Plesiadapsis_, based on skeletal remains, show this\r\nprimate to look much like a rodent with a long-snouted skull, clawed\r\nfeet, long body, and tail. There is conceivable relationship between the\r\nrodents and _Plesiadapsis_-like primates.\r\n\r\nThe dominant Tiffanian herbivorous mammals were members of the Order\r\nCondylarthra. These primitive ungulates were diverse in both size and\r\nappearance. It is probable that later modern ungulates (Artiodactyla,\r\nPerissodactyla) evolved from the Condylarthra; however, there are no\r\nsurviving members of this group. The Paleocene condylarths were mostly\r\nsmall animals and include such forms as _Haplaletes_, _Litomylus_, and\r\n_Gidleyina_. These mammals had somewhat insectivore-like teeth, and may\r\nhave bridged the gap between insectivores and archaic hoofed mammals.\r\nOne of the larger Tiffanian condylarths was _Phenacodus_. This mammal\r\nhad a long, massive skull and a long, probably flexible body. The limbs\r\nwere stout and short. The body ended in a long tail. Small hooves were\r\npresent on all digits, which numbered five per foot. The length of the\r\nlargest _Phenacodus_ was about 6 ft.\r\n\r\nCarnivorous and omnivorous condylarthra were also common. _Thryptacodon_\r\nand _Claenodon_ are two types known from the Evanston Formation in the\r\nFossil Basin.\r\n\r\nThe true carnivores (Order Carnivora) were also present. The Paleocene\r\ncarnivores were small and possibly arboreal in habit. The stem carnivore\r\nstock was represented by the family Miacidae. In the Fossil Basin the\r\nmiacid _Didymictis_ was common. In _Didymictis_, the mouth was armed\r\nwith small, sharp teeth. Most important, the typical carnivoran\r\ncarnassial (shearing) teeth had developed. Among carnivores, from\r\nPaleocene to Recent, the shearing blades developed on the last upper\r\npremolar and the first lower molars. Various kinds of shearing teeth\r\nhave evolved in other mammal lineages.\r\n\r\nMammals from the Wasatch Formation in Fossil Basin represent the\r\nGreybullian and Lysitean provincial ages (see Fig. 6). These fossils are\r\nof earliest Eocene and mid to early Eocene age. Fossil localities in the\r\nWasatch Formation of southwestern Wyoming are Knight Station (partly\r\nLysitean), at Elk Mountain (Greybullian), and at Fossil Butte itself.\r\nThe age of the Wasatch Formation at Fossil Butte is Lysitean.\r\n\r\nThe insectivores are represented by _Diacodon_, a small mammal known\r\nonly from fragmentary material.\r\n\r\nPrimates also continued to expand and diversify in Wasatchian time.\r\n_Microsyops_ was a very unusual type that belongs to the extinct family\r\nMicrosyopidae. The teeth were sharp and adapted for eating fruit and/or\r\ninsects. _Microsyops_ was about the size of a rat or slightly larger.\r\nThe microsyopid primates were limited to the Paleocene and Eocene and\r\nleft no later known descendants.\r\n\r\nAnother group of primates is represented by _Pelycodus_. This was a\r\nsmall lemur-like animal that may possibly have been an ancestor of\r\nhigher primates (monkeys, apes, and men). _Pelycodus_, like\r\n_Microsyops_, was an arboreal (tree-dwelling) animal which inhabited the\r\nforests of the Fossil Basin during the early Eocene.\r\n\r\nThe Order Taeniodonta is a strange and little known group of mammals. In\r\nthe sediments at Fossil Butte the taeniodonts are represented by\r\n_Ectoganus_. This was a moderately large animal. The skeletal\r\nadaptations were similar to those of moles, but there was no actual\r\nrelationship between the two groups. The front feet and legs were\r\nrobust, and bore large claws. _Ectoganus_ probably used these structures\r\nto grub for food, possibly roots. The incisor teeth were rootless and\r\npersistently growing. The tooth enamel was restricted to two bands on\r\neither side of the teeth. The single pair of upper and lower incisors\r\nwas greatly enlarged. The taeniodonts became extinct in the Eocene and\r\nleft no descendants.\r\n\r\nEqually as strange a group of animals as the taeniodonts are mammals in\r\nthe Order Tillodonta. These were herbivorous animals, some of which\r\nbecame quite large. They have many rodent-like characters, but were not\r\nrelated to rodents. In many respects, the morphology of rodents seems to\r\nhave lent itself to convergence. _Esthonyx_ was the most common\r\ntillodont from the Fossil Basin. Prominent, rootless incisors were a\r\ncharacteristic of the later members of the group. These incisors were\r\nchisel-like, as in rodents. The molars were unusual and bore certain\r\nresemblances to primitive carnivoran and insectivoran teeth. The\r\ntillodonts, however, bore uncertain relationships to other mammals and\r\nleft no descendants beyond the middle Eocene.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with recent faunas, Paleocene rodents were rare faunal\r\nelements. Two early rodents were found in the Fossil Basin Wasatch\r\nFormation:\r\n\r\n_Paramys_ was relatively unspecialized but was diverse in the number of\r\nspecies. One species of _Paramys_ was about 2 ft long and possessed a\r\nlong tail. The body was long and slender. The skull was small and rather\r\nsquirrel-like. The cheek teeth were quadrate and had low, blunt cusps.\r\nThe typical, single pair of chisel incisors was present both on lower\r\nand upper jaws. _Paramys_ was probably an arboreal form that did not\r\nlook too unlike a modern squirrel and may have had a similar mode of\r\nlife. Another rodent, _Reithroparamys_, was somewhat similar to\r\n_Paramys_ in size and appearance. The differences between the two\r\nanimals were mainly in the teeth and hind limbs. The latter showed\r\ncertain very minor structural modifications that suggested a saltatorial\r\n(jumping) mode of locomotion for _Reithroparamys_.\r\n\r\nBats (Order Chiroptera) are extremely rare as fossils because their\r\nvolant and cave-dwelling habitat as well as a fragile skeleton did not\r\nlend their remains to preservation. From the Green River Shales, from\r\nnear Fossil Butte, a complete articulated skeleton of a bat has been\r\nfound (Jepsen 1966). This animal, named _Caronycteris index_, was small\r\nand generalized in form. Superficially, it looked much like a typical\r\nbrown bat. This fossil is important because it demonstrates that the\r\nbats had already become good fliers by early Eocene time.\r\n\r\nThe condylarths were prominent in the early Eocene but diminished in\r\nimportance following this time. _Phenacodus_ was still extant; however,\r\nit was replaced in importance by the smaller _Hyopsodus_.\r\n\r\n_Hyopsodus_ is perhaps the most commonly recovered Eocene fossil mammal.\r\nThis animal was small and long-bodied and retained a more-or-less\r\ngeneralized structural pattern. In some respects _Hyopsodus_ was similar\r\nto both insectivores and primates and was at one time or another\r\nregarded as belonging to either of these two orders.\r\n\r\nSome of the later condylarths paralleled the more advanced ungulates.\r\nIndeed, the Perissodactyla (horses, tapirs, rhinos) and Artiodactyla\r\n(bovids, deer, pigs, sheep, etc.) were derived from early Tertiary\r\ncondylarths. _Meniscotherium_ was one such advanced condylarth. The\r\ncusps on its molars, instead of being blunt points, had developed into\r\ncrescentic patterns, somewhat like those in deer or camels. The\r\nrelationship of _Meniscotherium_ to modern ungulates is only one of\r\nparallel dental development. _Meniscotherium_ was a medium-sized animal,\r\nbut about the same build and size as that of a cocker spaniel.\r\n_Meniscotherium_, however, had hoofs on its toes and was a forest-living\r\nbrowser.\r\n\r\nThe condylarth _Haplomylus_ is found at the Elk Mountain Wasatchian\r\nlocality. This small animal is typical of the Greybullian level of\r\nfaunal organization (earliest Eocene). A supposed carnivorous condylarth\r\nwas _Pachyaena_. _Pachyaena_ was a fairly large animal for its time. The\r\nstrong, robust jaws and teeth and heavy build suggest that _Pachyaena_\r\nwas a predatory animal suited for preying on larger animals such as the\r\namphibious pantodont _Coryphodon_. The affinities of _Pachyaena_ to the\r\ncondylarths are uncertain and are based primarily on foot structure.\r\n\r\nThe miacid carnivores were abundant and varied. _Didymictis_ persisted\r\nand both _Vassacyon_ and _Vulpavus_ continued the arboreal,\r\nforest-dwelling habits of their Paleocene precursors.\r\n\r\nThe main carnivorous animals of the Eocene, however, were the creodonts\r\n(Order Creodonta) which were essentially early experimenters in\r\ncarnivorous habits. As such they were diversely specialized.\r\n_Proviverra_ (=_Sinopa_) was one of the smaller, predaceous creodonts\r\nthat inhabited Fossil Basin during Eocene times.\r\n\r\nOne of the most characteristic fossil mammals from the early Eocene of\r\nFossil Basin was _Coryphodon_. A specimen of _Coryphodon_ was also the\r\nfirst mammal fossil to be found in the Fossil Basin. The order of\r\nmammals to which _Coryphodon_ belongs, the Pantodonta, was a group of\r\nlarge and heavily built, herbivorous mammals. _Coryphodon_ was about the\r\nsize of a small rhinoceros. The skull was large and heavily built. The\r\nbrain, however, was small. The canine teeth were somewhat enlarged and\r\nstrong. Stout limbs supported the bulky body. In habits, _Coryphodon_\r\nwas possibly semi-aquatic.\r\n\r\nThe modern ungulates, Order Perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates) and\r\nOrder Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates), first appeared in the early\r\nEocene. The earliest members of both orders were small and relatively\r\nunspecialized.\r\n\r\nThe earliest perissodactyls were the horses and tapirs. The earliest\r\nhorses were represented by _Hyracotherium_. This small, slender, and\r\nlightly built horse was about the size of a fox terrier. The front feet\r\nhad four toes, and the hind feet three toes. The teeth suggest that this\r\nanimal was probably a browser, living in the forests. In the Fossil\r\nBasin, tapirs were known from deposits of Lysitean (mid to early Eocene)\r\nage of which _Heptodon_ was representative. The tapirs now live in the\r\ntropics of Malaysia and Latin America. Their present habitat suggests a\r\nsimilar environment may have been favored by the Eocene tapirs of the\r\nFossil Basin.\r\n\r\nThe first Artiodactyls were pig-like forms, although they are only\r\ndistantly related to true suids. _Protodichobune_ was small and may have\r\nlooked much like some of the early Perissodactyls. There are, however, a\r\ncomplex of structural features which serve to distinguish these\r\nmammalian orders from each other.\r\n\r\nThe mammal fauna from the Fowkes Formation places a late Bridgerian age\r\non the Sillem and Bulldog Hollow members (Nelson 1973). Small mammals\r\nwere most abundant in the Fowkes, especially primates and rodents. The\r\nmarsupials were characterized by _Peratherium_ which was a small,\r\nprobably arboreal, opossum-like animal. _Peratherium_ was but one stage\r\nin a slow and relatively conservative evolution of opossums that began\r\nin the Cretaceous.\r\n\r\nThe condylarths decreased in importance during Fowkes time and were\r\ngradually replaced by more advanced ungulates, the artiodactyls and\r\nperissodactyls. Only the small _Hyopsodus_ survived into the Bridgerian\r\nof the Fossil Basin. The horses continued to differentiate as evidenced\r\nby the appearance of _Orohippus_, an animal similar to _Hyracotherium_,\r\nbut with minor dental differences. The primitive tapirs were represented\r\nby _Hyrachyus_, a medium-sized herbivore which was nearly as closely\r\nrelated to the rhinoceroses as it was to the tapirs.\r\n\r\nThe primates were also diverse in Fowkes time; however, this group began\r\nto decline in importance following Bridgerian times. As a group, the\r\nprimates were restricted mainly to warm and forested environments. The\r\nlemur-like _Notharctus_ and the tarsier-like _Omomys_ and _Hemiacodon_\r\nwere common in the Fowkes. _Hemiacodon_ was typical of the late\r\nBridgerian (an index fossil).\r\n\r\nThe true carnivores, represented by _Miacis_, remained small in size,\r\nperhaps to avoid competition with the larger surviving creodonts.\r\n\r\nInsectivores from the Fowkes Formation are abundant and varied.\r\nUnfortunately, they are known almost exclusively from teeth. Fowkes\r\ninsectivores include the hedge-hog-like _Nyctitherium_, _Talpavus_, and\r\n_Scenopagus_. _Apatemys_ is an insectivore of uncertain affinities. The\r\nfeeding habits of these early insectivores were probably similar to\r\nthose of contemporary insectivore species (moles and shrews); however,\r\nthere is some evidence to suggest many of these small creatures may have\r\nbeen semi-arboreal.\r\n\r\nOne of the most unusual of middle Eocene creatures is the giant\r\n_Uintatherium_. This was a large browsing animal, about the size of a\r\nrhinoceros. What was most unusual about _Uintatherium_ was its skull\r\nwhich was large and strongly built. The large upper canines were\r\napparently formidable defensive weapons. The skulls of the males bore\r\nsix prominent bony protuberances which grew from the frontal region of\r\nthe skull. The function of these structures is unknown. They may have\r\nbeen of use for defense.\r\n\r\nDuring Bridgerian times, the rodents underwent an explosive adaptive\r\nradiation which ultimately may have led to the near extinction of the\r\nless well-adapted multituberculates. The diversity of Bridgerian rodents\r\nfrom Fossil Basin is impressive. Species of _Leptotomus_, _Paramys_,\r\n_Thisbemys_, _Microparamys_, _Sciuravus_, _Mysops_, and _Pauromys_\r\ndemonstrate that a wide range of adaptations of environments was\r\nexploited by the rodents. This diversity in life habits has been a mark\r\nof rodent evolution from the middle Eocene to the present day.\r\n\r\nThe above descriptions of the known mammal fossils from the Fossil Butte\r\narea are intended to demonstrate the varied life forms that once existed\r\nin southwestern Wyoming. Further collecting will almost certainly expand\r\nthe number of fossil mammal species from Fossil Basin and increase our\r\nknowledge of the succession of ancient environments which prevailed at\r\ndifferent times in the Fossil Basin area.\r\n\r\n               TABLE 2. _Mammals known from Fossil Basin_\r\n\r\n\r\n  Faunal lists—Middle Paleocene: Torrejonian\r\n    Class Mammalia\r\n      Multituberculata\r\n    _Ptilodus_\r\n    _Neoplagiaulax_\r\n    _Ectypodus_\r\n      Insectivora\r\n    _Leptacodon_\r\n    _Aphronorus_\r\n      Primates\r\n    _Torrejonia_\r\n    _Pronothodectes_\r\n      Condylarthra\r\n    _Chriacus_\r\n    _Tricentes_\r\n    _Promioclaenus_\r\n    _Litaletes_\r\n    _Haplaletes_\r\n  Late Paleocene: Tiffanian\r\n      Multituberculata\r\n    _Ptilodus?_\r\n      Primates\r\n    _Plesiadapis_\r\n      Condylarthra\r\n    _Thryptacodon_\r\n    _Claenodon_\r\n    _Litomylus_\r\n    _Haplaletes_\r\n    _Gidleyina_\r\n    _Phenacodus_\r\n      Carnivora\r\n    _Didymictis_\r\n      Pantodonta\r\n    Genus indeterminant.\r\n  Early Eocene: Graybullian\r\n      Primates\r\n    _Pelycodus_\r\n      Tillodontia\r\n    _Esthonyx_\r\n      Rodentia\r\n    _Paramys_\r\n      Creodonta\r\n    _Proviverra_\r\n      Carnivora\r\n    _Didymictis_\r\n    _Vassacyon_\r\n      Condylarthra\r\n    _Pachyaena_\r\n    _Haplomylus_\r\n    _Hyopsodus_\r\n    _Phenacodus_\r\n    _Meniscotherium?_\r\n      Pantodonta\r\n    _Coryphodon_\r\n      Perissodactyla\r\n    _Hyracotherium_\r\n      Artiodactyla\r\n    _Diacodexis_\r\n  Early Eocene: Lysitean\r\n      Insectivora\r\n    _Diacodon_\r\n      Primates\r\n    _Pelycodus_\r\n    _Microsyops_\r\n      Tillodontia\r\n    _Esthonyx_\r\n      Rodentia\r\n    _Paramys_\r\n    _Reithroparamys_\r\n      Creodonta\r\n    _Proviverra_\r\n      Carnivora\r\n    _Didymictis_\r\n    _Vulpavus_\r\n      Condylarthra\r\n    _Pachyaena?_\r\n    _Hyopsodus_\r\n    _Phenacodus_\r\n    _Meniscotherium?_\r\n      Pantodonta\r\n    _Coryphodon_\r\n      Perissodactyla\r\n    _Hyracotherium_\r\n    _Heptodon_\r\n      Artiodactyla\r\n    _Protodichobune_\r\n  Early Eocene: Wasatchian (general)\r\n      Chiroptera\r\n    _Icaronycteris_\r\n  Late Middle Eocene: Late Bridgerian\r\n      Marsupialia\r\n    _Peratherium_\r\n      Insectivora\r\n    _Apatemys_\r\n    _Nyctitherium_\r\n    _Scenopagus_\r\n    _Talpavus_\r\n      Primates\r\n    _Hemiacodon_\r\n    _Omomys_\r\n    _Notharctus_\r\n      Condylarthra\r\n    _Hyopsodus_\r\n      Rodentia\r\n    _Leptotomus_\r\n    _Microparamys_\r\n    _Mysops_\r\n    _Paramys_\r\n    _Pauromys_\r\n    _Sciuravus_\r\n    _Thisbemys_\r\n      Dinocerata\r\n    _Uintatherium_\r\n      Perissodactyla\r\n    _Orohippus_\r\n    _Hyrachyus_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PALEOECOLOGY AND TAPHONOMY\r\n\r\n\r\nPaleoecology is the study of ancient biotic communities and their\r\nrelationship to the abiotic environment. The conclusions of paleoecology\r\nare reached by studying in detail the fossils and sediments and whatever\r\nrelationships exist between them. Its ultimate aim is to build a picture\r\nof the climate, flora, fauna, and topographic setting of an area. For\r\nthis reason it borrows heavily from paleontology, paleobotany,\r\nsedimentology, and climatology.\r\n\r\nFrom studying modern environments, it is observed that each has its own\r\ntype of sediment. When certain sediments are found in the rock record,\r\nit is generally assumed that they represent environments similar to\r\nmodern ones that produce similar deposits. For example, limestone is\r\nforming today in warm, shallow, well-lighted, well-aerated water. When\r\nlimestone is found in a rock sequence, it is usually assumed that the\r\nsame or similar environmental conditions occurred in that area in the\r\npast. Fossils can further refine the interpretation.\r\n\r\nAs can be interpreted from foregoing discussions, the sediments\r\ndeposited in the Fossil Basin vary from stream and flood-plain fluvial\r\nto lacustrine. At times, material eroded from surrounding uplands was\r\ncarried by streams throughout the basin. These rocks are exemplified by\r\nthe Evanston and parts of the Wasatch and Fowkes formations. When the\r\nlake appeared, lacustrine sediments, marlstone, and shale were deposited\r\nin the lake, while around the periphery of the basin, fluvial sediments\r\ncontinued to accumulate.\r\n\r\nPlants found in the lake sediments of Fossil Basin tell us much about\r\nthe climatic conditions that prevailed during the Eocene. The flora is\r\nquite similar to that now existing in the southeastern United States,\r\nreflecting a warm and humid climate. One of the striking examples is\r\nthat of huge palm fronds that occasionally are found in the fish\r\nquarries at Fossil Butte. These seem to be fronds that blew from the\r\ntrees into the lake. Soon they became water-logged and settled to the\r\nbottom to be preserved.\r\n\r\nThe land animals indicate that a rather wide range of ecologic niches\r\nexisted over the basin before the lake came into being, around the lake\r\nduring its presence, and again all over the basin after the lake\r\ndisappeared. Many of the smaller mammals, some of the rodents, and most\r\nof the primates were almost certainly arboreal. The large mammals such\r\nas uintatheres, pantodonts, and tapiroids may have been stream-side or\r\nmarsh dwellers. Probably inhabiting the forest floor and feeding on low\r\nbushes and undergrowth were such forms as the condylarths, horses,\r\nartiodactyls, and some of the rodents. Feeding on the rodents and other\r\nsmaller mammals were the creodonts and miacids. Tiny shrew-like forms\r\nscampered about the undergrowth and fed upon worms and insects.\r\n\r\nBradley (1963) has estimated possible temperature and precipitation\r\nlevels in southwestern Wyoming during the Eocene. Bradley’s modern\r\nanalogues were the Gulf Coast and Great Lakes regions. From a series of\r\ncalculations, an average annual temperature of 65°F is postulated. This\r\ncould have fluctuated greatly in the inland setting of Fossil Basin.\r\nPrecipitation amounts were possibly on the order of 30-43 inches\r\nannually. The amount of annual evaporation was also possibly in the\r\nrange of 30-43 inches.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that Fossil Lake was thermally stratified—that is, with\r\ncolder, denser water at depth (hypolimnion) and warmer, less dense water\r\n(epilimnion) nearer the surface. The deeper waters probably would have\r\nbeen devoid of oxygen, hence essentially uninhabited other than by\r\nanaerobic bacteria that survive without oxygen. If the bottom had been\r\noxygenated, many types of life would have burrowed into the sediment\r\nthus destroying the delicate varves (Fig. 28). The lake was probably\r\ndeep enough that wind and wave action did not roil the bottom sediments.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 28. A section of shales from the fish beds\r\n    showing thin laminae that are interpreted as varves. Enlarged six\r\n    times.]\r\n\r\nThere have been many attempts to interpret the taphonomy (see glossary)\r\nof concentrations of fish at Fossil Butte. Bradley (1948) interpreted\r\nthe cause of death and the reason for their preservation as follows:\r\n\r\n  In this basin (Fossil, Wyo.) hundreds of thousands of beautifully\r\n  preserved fish are entombed in the varved sediments. Even the delicate\r\n  fin and tail rays and other bones originally held in place only by\r\n  tissue are virtually undisturbed, and even the scales are in place\r\n  almost completely undisturbed. It seems to me that the picture of this\r\n  lake as a thermally stratified water body provides nearly all the\r\n  necessary information to account for the excellent preservation of\r\n  these fish. Only in the stagnant hypolimnion could they have escaped\r\n  being torn to pieces by scavengers or distorted by bottom feeders. It\r\n  is significant that all the well preserved fish are in varved\r\n  sediments. Those in non-varved sediments are a disordered mass of\r\n  broken and chewed up bones.\r\n\r\n  The only part of the story lacking now is how the fish died and got\r\n  into the hypolimnion. Limnology offers two possible explanations.\r\n  Sometimes when the surface of a lake gets excessively warm, fish will\r\n  plunge into deep water and might thus penetrate the hypolimnion, be\r\n  overcome by hydrogen sulphide, and also have the gas in their swim\r\n  bladders chilled so that they sank at once to the bottom. Once there,\r\n  only anaerobic bacteria would attack them. The other hypothesis is\r\n  that the thermally stratified lake was suddenly chilled so that it\r\n  overturned more rapidly than the hydrogen sulphide could be oxydized\r\n  and so killed off large numbers of fish. This seems a little more\r\n  probable as the fossil fish are of all ages and sizes.\r\n\r\nThe fish in these quarries have been collected since the 1870s but\r\nmainly by commercial collectors. Most museum collections were purchased\r\nfrom these commercial collectors, hence they consist almost entirely of\r\nperfectly preserved fish, as poorly preserved specimens would be\r\ndiscarded by the collectors as of no monetary value. The result has been\r\nthat most people, including Bradley, were misled into believing all of\r\nthe fish in the varved sediments of the quarry were perfectly preserved.\r\nAs nearly as can be determined, the first attempt to systematically\r\ncollect and study this concentration of fish was that by paleontologists\r\nfrom the University of Wyoming (McGrew 1974). This work threw much new\r\nlight on the occurrence and made available much new data that permit new\r\ninterpretations.\r\n\r\nShales of the Green River Formation in general have been described by\r\nBradley (1931) and he specifically mentioned those of the fish layer in\r\nthe Fossil Basin as follows: “Plate 1 shows a thin section of the varved\r\nmarlstone in the small, unnamed Green River Lake west of Gosiute Lake,\r\nwhere the varves are better developed. Each varve or annual deposit,\r\nconsists of a layer of microgranular carbonates and a thinner, dark\r\nlayer of organic matter” (Bradley 1948:645). The X-ray diffraction\r\nanalyses performed by John Ward Smith of the Laramie Energy Research\r\nCenter showed that the shales of the “fish layer” consist predominantly\r\nof calcite (roughly 60%), aragonite and dolomite (approximately 20%),\r\nand quartz (up to 10%).\r\n\r\nAlthough fish are numerous throughout the thickness of this “fish\r\nlayer,” there are three laminae that contain so many fish that it is\r\nalmost certain that they represent catastrophic mass mortalities. Two\r\nare made up primarily of _Priscacara_ and one consists almost\r\nexclusively of _Knightia_.\r\n\r\nX-ray photos show that a rather high percentage of the fish in the\r\nshales are not perfectly preserved but have undergone varying amounts of\r\ndisarticulation. There appears to be an orderly sequence of stages of\r\ndecomposition—from essentially perfect articulation to total\r\ndisarticulation. Disarticulation first appears in the most anterior\r\nvertebrae. From there it rapidly proceeds anteriorly into the head\r\nregion and appears to do so posteriorly at a slower rate. In many\r\nspecimens the head and anterior half of the body are completely\r\ndisarticulated, while the posterior part of the body shows no\r\ndisarticulation whatever.\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that after the dead fish settled to the bottom of the\r\nlake, external anaerobic bacteria found access to the “innards” of the\r\nfish via the opercular opening. This would account for the first sign of\r\ndecomposition and disarticulation being just back of the head.\r\n\r\nIn the blocks of shale covered by X-ray there were 385 fish. For\r\nconvenience, these were classified into six groups, group I showing no\r\ndiscernable disarticulation and group VI (Fig. 29) showing total\r\ndisarticulation. The number and percentage of fish in each group are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Group I          223 fish        58%\r\n  Group II          38 fish        10%\r\n  Group III         14 fish         4%\r\n  Group IV          27 fish         7%\r\n  Group V           24 fish         6%\r\n  Group VI          59 fish        15%\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 29. A partially disarticulated skeleton of a\r\n    large _Priscacara_, Group IV.]\r\n\r\nBecause of the predominance of completely articulated fish throughout\r\nthe quarry and the fact that the fish involved in the mass mortalities\r\nshow no disarticulation, it seems probable that some connection might\r\nexist between the death of the fish and conditions of the lake bottom\r\nthat would cause their perfect preservation. It would seem that rapid\r\nburial might be the most obvious reason for excellent preservation. Thus\r\nany factor or combination of factors that would cause rapid\r\nprecipitation of carbonates and also would cause mortality of fish would\r\nsatisfy our requirements. One obvious factor that could, at least\r\ntheoretically, fulfill these requirements would be an annual bloom of\r\nblue-green algae that are known to be toxic to fish (Prescott 1948).\r\nSuch blooms usually occur during the warmest part of the summer when\r\nCaCO₃ is least soluble. By extracting CO₂ from the water, these algae\r\nare known to cause precipitation of CaCO₃. Thus we have a possible cause\r\nfor some annual fish kill and perhaps an occasional superbloom that\r\nwould bring about a catastrophic mass mortality. The highest mortality\r\nof fish then might have occurred during late summer algal blooms and at\r\nthis time also would occur the most rapid precipitation of CaCO₃.\r\n\r\nIt is not known how much deposition of CaCO₃ would be required to\r\nprotect a fish from disarticulation. It may be that a very thin layer,\r\nespecially if mixed with organic ooze, might provide an effective seal\r\nto slow decomposition and prevent disarticulation. If sufficient CaCO₃\r\nwas precipitated and deposited to cover the fish that died during this\r\nperiod, one might expect perfect preservation. Such fish would fit into\r\ngroup I. Those fish that died just after this period might lie exposed\r\non the lake bottom for most of a year and be subject to disarticulation.\r\nIf little or no deposition took place during the rest of the year, fish\r\nthat died just after the period of deposition should be the most\r\ncompletely disarticulated and fit into group VI. During the fall,\r\nwinter, and spring, fish that died of attritional mortality would be\r\ndisarticulated according to the length of time they lay on the bottom\r\nprior to the next period of deposition.\r\n\r\nIf the foregoing is true, one should be able to determine the\r\napproximate time of year fish died by the degree of disarticulation. One\r\nmight assume that blooms of blue-green algae and hence precipitation of\r\nCaCO₃ would take place sometime during August and/or September. Thus we\r\nshould expect the most fish and those most perfectly preserved to have\r\ndied during this time period (group I). Those fish that died in October\r\nand/or November should be the most completely disarticulated (group VI),\r\nand those that died in June or July should show only a slight degree of\r\ndisarticulation (group II). The distribution of the stages of\r\ndisarticulation seems to fit almost exactly the pattern that one would\r\nexpect if this interpretation is correct.\r\n\r\nGunter (1947) has shown that annual periods of excess salinity in Texas\r\nlagoons cause an annual increase in the death of fish and occasionally a\r\ncatastrophic mass mortality. Because Lake Gosiute is known to have been\r\nsaline, it might be assumed that somewhat similar chemical conditions\r\nprevailed in the Fossil Lake. It is not known definitely that the two\r\nlakes were ever connected but if they were, it was most probably a\r\nnarrow connection near the southern end of Fossil Lake and probably a\r\nrather temporary connection.\r\n\r\nThat a rather long period of aridity occurred in the general region is\r\ndemonstrated by various depositional features, primary structures, and\r\nsalt deposition in Gosiute Lake in a part of the Green River Formation.\r\nThese deposits appear to have settled down during Lostcabinian (late to\r\nearly Eocene) times. Because the Wasatch Formation immediately\r\nunderlying the Fossil Butte Member of the Green River Formation in the\r\nFossil Syncline Basin is Lysitean (mid to early Eocene), it is probable\r\nthat the fish deposits are of Lostcabinian age. Thus it may well be that\r\nthe long period of aridity occurred during the deposition of the fish\r\nbeds. While the Fossil Lake probably never reached the high degree of\r\nsalinity present in Lake Gosiute, it was probably sufficiently saline\r\nthat periods of excessive evaporation could increase the salinity enough\r\nto contribute to the mortality of fish and occasionally cause a\r\ncatastrophic mass mortality such as those described by Gunter. The\r\npresence of aragonite and dolomite in the shales suggests that at least\r\nsome of the carbonate deposition might well have been because of\r\nexcessive evaporation and high concentrations of carbonates (Smith 1974,\r\npers. comm.).\r\n\r\nAt the University of Wyoming, an attempt is being made to interpret\r\nscales of fish from the quarries. In a number of specimens annuli can be\r\nobserved and circuli counted. Although removal of scales for study is\r\nextremely difficult, a number has been removed and photographed with a\r\nscanning electron microscope. In Lake George, Florida, black crappie\r\ndevelop annuli during January, February, March, and April (Huish 1954).\r\nClimatic conditions in north central Florida may be similar to those\r\nthat existed in western Wyoming during the early Eocene. Thus annuli may\r\nhave developed at the same time of year. By counting the number of\r\ncirculi between the last annulus and the edge of the scale, it should be\r\npossible to determine the approximate time of death of a fossil fish. If\r\nthis should correlate with the degree of disarticulation, a check on\r\nthis interpretation should be possible. Sufficient data are not yet\r\navailable, however, for the results to be conclusive.\r\n\r\nIt is not intended to suggest that the conditions outlined above could\r\naccount for all of the fish concentrations in the Green River Shales. In\r\ncertain shales in the Green River Basin, for example, the concentrations\r\nof _Knightia_ in nonvarved shales appear to have been deposited in quite\r\nshallow water. These fish are extremely well preserved but were\r\nobviously laid down under conditions quite different from those at\r\nFossil Butte. Much study of these occurrences will be necessary before\r\ninterpretations are possible.\r\n\r\nThe story, as told here, should make it clear that the earth is\r\never-changing. What was once a beautiful, deep lake in an area of lush\r\ntropical forests is now a dry, sagebrush desert. What was once an area\r\nin which sediments were accumulating is now an area of erosion,\r\noccasioned by a broad uplift of the region near the end of Tertiary\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that this brief story of the geologic history of Fossil\r\nButte National Monument will give the reader some appreciation of the\r\ngeologic complexity not only of the monument itself but of the\r\nsurrounding area as well. Certainly such knowledge will add to the\r\nenjoyment of a visit to the monument.\r\n\r\nIt may seem that geologists have all of the answers. This, however, is\r\nnot so. Interpretations are made on the basis of available evidence.\r\nEach time a geologist studies an area more geologic data and more\r\nevidence become available and our interpretations become a little more\r\naccurate. It will be many years before all details of this fascinating\r\nhistory will be known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GLOSSARY\r\n\r\n\r\n  ANAEROBIC.

We would like\r\nto cite particularly Doctors Steven Oriel and Joshua Tracy of the United\r\nStates Geological Survey, whose studies have clarified the stratigraphic\r\nrelationships of the sediments involved. Dr. D. L. Blackstone, Jr., of\r\nthe University of Wyoming supplied information from his yet unpublished\r\ninterpretations of the complicated structure of the Idaho-Wyoming thrust\r\nbelt. Mr. Tom Bown helped with the structural part of the report and\r\ncritically reviewed other parts. The drafting, except for Figs. 3 and 9,\r\nwas done by Mr. Evan Groutage. Mrs. Elaine Hertzfeldt, secretary for the\r\nDepartment of Geology, aided greatly in preparing this manuscript.\r\n\r\n                                                          Paul O.
