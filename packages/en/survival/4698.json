Burgess\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I: Whitefoot Spends A Happy Winter\r\n\r\nIn all his short life Whitefoot the Wood Mouse never had spent such a\r\nhappy winter. Whitefoot is one of those wise little people who never\r\nallow unpleasant things of the past to spoil their present happiness,\r\nand who never borrow trouble from the future. Whitefoot believes in\r\ngetting the most from the present. The things which are past are past,\r\nand that is all there is to it. There is no use in thinking about them.\r\nAs for the things of the future, it will be time enough to think about\r\nthem when they happen.\r\n\r\nIf you and I had as many things to worry about as does Whitefoot the\r\nWood Mouse, we probably never would be happy at all. But Whitefoot is\r\nhappy whenever he has a chance to be, and in this he is wiser than most\r\nhuman beings. You see, there is not one of all the little people in the\r\nGreen Forest who has so many enemies to watch out for as has Whitefoot.\r\nThere are ever so many who would like nothing better than to dine on\r\nplump little Whitefoot. There are Buster Bear and Billy Mink and Shadow\r\nthe Weasel and Unc' Billy Possum and Hooty the Owl and all the members\r\nof the Hawk family, not to mention Blacky the Crow in times when other\r\nfood is scarce. Reddy and Granny Fox and Old Man Coyote are always\r\nlooking for him.\r\n\r\nSo you see Whitefoot never knows at what instant he may have to run for\r\nhis life. That is why he is such a timid little fellow and is always\r\nrunning away at the least little unexpected sound. In spite of all this\r\nhe is a happy little chap.\r\n\r\nIt was early in the winter that Whitefoot found a little hole in a\r\ncorner of Farmer Brown's sugar-house and crept inside to see what it was\r\nlike in there. It didn't take him long to decide that it was the most\r\ndelightful place he ever had found. He promptly decided to move in and\r\nspend the winter. In one end of the sugar-house was a pile of wood. Down\r\nunder this Whitefoot made himself a warm, comfortable nest. It was a\r\nregular castle to Whitefoot. He moved over to it the store of seeds he\r\nhad laid up for winter use.\r\n\r\nNot one of his enemies ever thought of visiting the sugar-house in\r\nsearch of Whitefoot, and they wouldn't have been able to get in if they\r\nhad. When rough Brother North Wind howled outside, and sleet and\r\nsnow were making other little people shiver, Whitefoot was warm and\r\ncomfortable. There was all the room he needed or wanted in which to\r\nrun about and play. He could go outside when he chose to, but he didn't\r\nchoose to very often. For days at a time he didn't have a single fright.\r\nYes indeed, Whitefoot spent a happy winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II: Whitefoot Sees Queer Things\r\n\r\nWhitefoot had spent the winter undisturbed in Farmer Brown's\r\nsugar-house. He had almost forgotten the meaning of fear. He had come\r\nto look on that sugar-house as belonging to him. It wasn't until Farmer\r\nBrown's boy came over to prepare things for sugaring that Whitefoot got\r\na single real fright. The instant Farmer Brown's boy opened the door,\r\nWhitefoot scampered down under the pile of wood to his snug little nest,\r\nand there he lay, listening to the strange sounds. At last he could\r\nstand it no longer and crept to a place where he could peep out and see\r\nwhat was going on. It didn't take him long to discover that this great\r\ntwo-legged creature was not looking for him, and right away he felt\r\nbetter. After a while Farmer Brown's boy went away, and Whitefoot had\r\nthe little sugar-house to himself again.\r\n\r\nBut Farmer Brown's boy had carelessly left the door wide open. Whitefoot\r\ndidn't like that open door. It made him nervous. There was nothing to\r\nprevent those who hunt him from walking right in. So the rest of that\r\nnight Whitefoot felt uncomfortable and anxious.\r\n\r\nHe felt still more anxious when next day Farmer Brown's boy returned and\r\nbecame very busy putting things to right. Then Farmer Brown himself came\r\nand strange things began to happen. It became as warm as in summer.\r\nYou see Farmer Brown had built a fire under the evaporator. Whitefoot's\r\ncuriosity kept him at a place where he could peep out and watch all that\r\nwas done. He saw Farmer Brown and Farmer Brown's boy pour pails of sap\r\ninto a great pan. By and by a delicious odor filled the sugar-house.\r\nIt didn't take him a great while to discover that these two-legged\r\ncreatures were so busy that he had nothing to fear from them, and so he\r\ncrept out to watch. He saw them draw the golden syrup from one end of\r\nthe evaporator and fill shining tin cans with it. Day after day they did\r\nthe same thing. At night when they had left and all was quiet inside the\r\nsugar-house, Whitefoot stole out and found delicious crumbs where they\r\nhad eaten their lunch. He tasted that thick golden stuff and found it\r\nsweet and good. Later he watched them make sugar and nearly made himself\r\nsick that night when they had gone home, for they had left some of that\r\nsugar where he could get at it. He didn't understand these queer doings\r\nat all. But he was no longer afraid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III: Farmer Brown's Boy Becomes Acquainted\r\n\r\nIt didn't take Farmer Brown's boy long to discover that Whitefoot the\r\nWood Mouse was living in the little sugar-house. He caught glimpses of\r\nWhitefoot peeping out at him. Now Farmer Brown's boy is wise in the ways\r\nof the little people of the Green Forest. Right away he made up his\r\nmind to get acquainted with Whitefoot. He knew that not in all the\r\nGreen Forest is there a more timid little fellow than Whitefoot, and\r\nhe thought it would be a fine thing to be able to win the confidence of\r\nsuch a shy little chap.\r\n\r\nSo at first Farmer Brown's boy paid no attention whatever to Whitefoot.\r\nHe took care that Whitefoot shouldn't even know that he had been seen.\r\nEvery day when he ate his lunch, Farmer Brown's boy scattered a lot\r\nof crumbs close to the pile of wood under which Whitefoot had made his\r\nhome. Then he and Farmer Brown would go out to collect sap. When they\r\nreturned not a crumb would be left.\r\n\r\nOne day Farmer Brown's boy scattered some particularly delicious crumbs.\r\nThen, instead of going out, he sat down on a bench and kept perfectly\r\nstill. Farmer Brown and Bowser the Hound went out. Of course Whitefoot\r\nheard them go out, and right away he poked his little head out from\r\nunder the pile of wood to see if the way was clear. Farmer Brown's boy\r\nsat there right in plain sight, but Whitefoot didn't see him. That was\r\nbecause Farmer Brown's boy didn't move the least bit. Whitefoot ran out\r\nand at once began to eat those delicious crumbs. When he had filled his\r\nlittle stomach, he began to carry the remainder back to his storehouse\r\nunderneath the woodpile. While he was gone on one of these trips, Farmer\r\nBrown's boy scattered more crumbs in a line that led right up to his\r\nfoot. Right there he placed a big piece of bread crust.\r\n\r\nWhitefoot was working so hard and so fast to get all those delicious\r\nbits of food that he took no notice of anything else until he reached\r\nthat piece of crust. Then he happened to look up right into the eyes\r\nof Farmer Brown's boy. With a frightened little squeak Whitefoot darted\r\nback, and for a long time he was afraid to come out again.\r\n\r\nBut Farmer Brown's boy didn't move, and at last Whitefoot could stand\r\nthe temptation no longer. He darted out halfway, scurried back, came out\r\nagain, and at last ventured right up to the crust. Then he began to drag\r\nit back to the woodpile. Still Farmer Brown's boy did not move.\r\n\r\nFor two or three days the same thing happened. By this time, Whitefoot\r\nhad lost all fear. He knew that Farmer Brown's boy would not harm him,\r\nand it was not long before he ventured to take a bit of food from Farmer\r\nBrown's boy's hand. After that Farmer Brown's boy took care that no\r\ncrumbs should be scattered on the ground. Whitefoot had to come to him\r\nfor his food, and always Farmer Brown's boy had something delicious for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV: Whitefoot Grows Anxious\r\n\r\n   'Tis sad indeed to trust a friend\r\n   Then have that trust abruptly end.\r\n      --Whitefoot\r\n\r\nI know of nothing that is more sad than to feel that a friend is no\r\nlonger to be trusted. There came a time when Whitefoot the Wood Mouse\r\nalmost had this feeling. It was a very, very anxious time for Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nYou see, Whitefoot and Farmer Brown's boy had become the very best\r\nof friends there in the little sugar-house. They had become such good\r\nfriends that Whitefoot did not hesitate to take food from the hands of\r\nFarmer Brown's boy. Never in all his life had he had so much to eat or\r\nsuch good things to eat. He was getting so fat that his handsome little\r\ncoat was uncomfortably tight. He ran about fearlessly while Farmer Brown\r\nand Farmer Brown's boy were making maple syrup and maple sugar. He had\r\neven lost his fear of Bowser the Hound, for Bowser had paid no attention\r\nto him whatever.\r\n\r\nNow you remember that Whitefoot had made his home way down beneath the\r\ngreat pile of wood in the sugar-house. Of course Farmer Brown and Farmer\r\nBrown's boy used that wood for the fire to boil the sap to make the\r\nsyrup and sugar. Whitefoot thought nothing of this until one day he\r\ndiscovered that his little home was no longer as dark as it had been.\r\nA little ray of light crept down between the sticks. Presently another\r\nlittle ray of light crept down between the sticks.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Whitefoot began to grow anxious. It was then he\r\nrealized that that pile of wood was growing smaller and smaller, and if\r\nit kept on growing smaller, by and by there wouldn't be any pile of\r\nwood and his little home wouldn't be hidden at all. Of course Whitefoot\r\ndidn't understand why that wood was slipping away. In spite of himself\r\nhe began to grow suspicious. He couldn't think of any reason why that\r\nwood should be taken away, unless it was to look for his little home.\r\nFarmer Brown's boy was just as kind and friendly as ever, but all the\r\ntime more and more light crept in, as the wood vanished.\r\n\r\n“Oh dear, what does it mean?” cried Whitefoot to himself. “They must be\r\nlooking for my home, yet they have been so good to me that it is hard\r\nto believe they mean any harm. I do hope they will stop taking this wood\r\naway. I won't have any hiding-place at all, and then I will have to\r\ngo outside back to my old home in the hollow stump. I don't want to do\r\nthat. Oh, dear! Oh, dear! I was so happy and now I am so worried! Why\r\ncan't happy times last always?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V: The End Of Whitefoot's Worries\r\n\r\n   You never can tell!  You never can tell!\r\n   Things going wrong will often end well.\r\n      --Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nThe next time you meet him just ask Whitefoot if this isn't so. Things\r\nhad been going very wrong for Whitefoot. It had begun to look to\r\nWhitefoot as if he would no longer have a snug, hidden little home in\r\nFarmer Brown's sugar-house. The pile of wood under which he had made\r\nthat snug little home was disappearing so fast that it began to look as\r\nif in a little while there would be no wood at all.\r\n\r\nWhitefoot quite lost his appetite. He no longer came out to take food\r\nfrom Farmer Brown's boy's hand. He stayed right in his snug little home\r\nand worried.\r\n\r\nNow Farmer Brown's boy had not once thought of the trouble he was\r\nmaking. He wondered what had become of Whitefoot, and in his turn he\r\nbegan to worry. He was afraid that something had happened to his little\r\nfriend. He was thinking of this as he fed the sticks of wood to the fire\r\nfor boiling the sap to make syrup and sugar. Finally, as he pulled away\r\ntwo big sticks, he saw something that made him whistle with surprise. It\r\nwas Whitefoot's nest which he had so cleverly hidden way down underneath\r\nthat pile of wood when he had first moved into the sugar-house. With a\r\nfrightened little squeak, Whitefoot ran out, scurried across the little\r\nsugar-house and out though the open door.\r\n\r\nFarmer Brown's boy understood. He understood perfectly that little\r\npeople like Whitefoot want their homes hidden away in the dark. “Poor\r\nlittle chap,” said Farmer Brown's boy.\"He had a regular castle here and\r\nwe have destroyed it. He's got the snuggest kind of a little nest here,\r\nbut he won't come back to it so long as it is right out in plain sight.\r\nHe probably thinks we have been hunting for this little home of his.\r\nHello! Here's his storehouse! I've often wondered how the little rascal\r\ncould eat so much, but now I understand. He stored away here more\r\nthan half of the good things I have given him. I am glad he did. If he\r\nhadn't, he might not come back, but I feel sure that to-night, when\r\nall is quiet, he will come back to take away all his food. I must do\r\nsomething to keep him here.”\r\n\r\nFarmer Brown's boy sat down to think things over. Then he got an old box\r\nand made a little round hole in one end of it. Very carefully he took up\r\nWhitefoot's nest and placed it under the old box in the darkest corner\r\nof the sugar-house. Then he carried all Whitefoot's supplies over there\r\nand put them under the box. He went outside, and got some branches of\r\nhemlock and threw these in a little pile over the box. After this he\r\nscattered some crumbs just outside.\r\n\r\nLate that night Whitefoot did come back. The crumbs led him to the old\r\nbox. He crept inside. There was his snug little home! All in a second\r\nWhitefoot understood, and trust and happiness returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI: A Very Careless Jump\r\n\r\nWhitefoot once more was happy. When he found his snug little nest and\r\nhis store of food under that old box in the darkest corner of Farmer\r\nBrown's sugar-house, he knew that Farmer Brown's boy must have placed\r\nthem there. It was better than the old place under the woodpile. It was\r\nthe best place for a home Whitefoot ever had had. It didn't take him\r\nlong to change his mind about leaving the little sugar-house. Somehow\r\nhe seemed to know right down inside that his home would not again be\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\nSo he proceeded to rearrange his nest and to put all his supplies of\r\nfood in one corner of the old box. When everything was placed to suit\r\nhim he ventured out, for now that he no longer feared Farmer Brown's boy\r\nhe wanted to see all that was going on. He liked to jump up on the\r\nbench where Farmer Brown's boy sometimes sat. He would climb up to where\r\nFarmer Brown's boy's coat hung and explore the pockets of it. Once he\r\nstole Farmer Brown's boy's handkerchief. He wanted it to add to the\r\nmaterial his nest was made of. Farmer Brown's boy discovered it just as\r\nit was disappearing, and how he laughed as he pulled it away.\r\n\r\nSo, what with eating and sleeping and playing about, secure in the\r\nfeeling that no harm could come to him, Whitefoot was happier than ever\r\nbefore in his little life. He knew that Farmer Brown's boy and Farmer\r\nBrown and Bowser the Hound were his friends. He knew, too, that so long\r\nas they were about, none of his enemies would dare come near. This being\r\nso, of course there was nothing to be afraid of. No harm could possibly\r\ncome to him. At least, that is what Whitefoot thought.\r\n\r\nBut you know, enemies are not the only dangers to watch out for.\r\nAccidents will happen. When they do happen, it is very likely to be when\r\nthe possibility of them is farthest from your thoughts. Almost always\r\nthey are due to heedlessness or carelessness. It was heedlessness that\r\ngot Whitefoot into one of the worst mishaps of his whole life.\r\n\r\nHe had been running and jumping all around the inside of the little\r\nsugar-house. He loves to run and jump, and he had been having just the\r\nbest time ever. Finally Whitefoot ran along the old bench and jumped\r\nfrom the end of it for a box standing on end, which Farmer Brown's\r\nboy sometimes used to sit on. It wasn't a very long jump, but somehow\r\nWhitefoot misjudged it. He was heedless, and he didn't jump quite far\r\nenough. Right beside that box was a tin pail half filled with sap.\r\nInstead of landing on the box, Whitefoot landed with a splash in that\r\npail of sap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII: Whitefoot Gives Up Hope\r\n\r\nWhitefoot had been in many tight places. Yes, indeed, Whitefoot had been\r\nin many tight places. He had had narrow escapes of all kinds. But never\r\nhad he felt so utterly hopeless as now. The moment he landed in that\r\nsap, Whitefoot began to swim frantically. He isn't a particularly good\r\nswimmer, but he could swim well enough to keep afloat for a while. His\r\nfirst thought was to scramble up the side of the tin pail, but when he\r\nreached it and tried to fasten his sharp little claws into it in order\r\nto climb, he discovered that he couldn't. Sharp as they were, his little\r\nclaws just slipped, and his struggles to get up only resulted in tiring\r\nhim out and in plunging him wholly beneath the sap. He came up choking\r\nand gasping. Then round and round inside that pail he paddled, stopping\r\nevery two or three seconds to try to climb up that hateful, smooth,\r\nshiny wall.\r\n\r\nThe more he tried to climb out, the more frightened he became.\r\n\r\nHe was in a perfect panic of fear. He quite lost his head, did\r\nWhitefoot. The harder he struggled, the more tired he became, and the\r\ngreater was his danger of drowning.\r\n\r\nWhitefoot squeaked pitifully. He didn't want to drown. Of course not. He\r\nwanted to live. But unless he could get out of that pail very soon, he\r\nwould drown. He knew it. He knew that he couldn't hold on much longer.\r\nHe knew that just as soon as he stopped paddling, he would sink. Already\r\nhe was so tired from his frantic efforts to escape that it seemed to\r\nhim that he couldn't hold out any longer. But somehow he kept his legs\r\nmoving, and so kept afloat.\r\n\r\nJust why he kept struggling, Whitefoot couldn't have told. It wasn't\r\nbecause he had any hope. He didn't have the least bit of hope. He knew\r\nnow that he couldn't climb the sides of that pail, and there was no\r\nother way of getting out. Still he kept on paddling. It was the only way\r\nto keep from drowning, and though he felt sure that he had got to drown\r\nat last, he just wouldn't until he actually had to. And all the time\r\nWhitefoot squeaked hopelessly, despairingly, pitifully. He did it\r\nwithout knowing that he did it, just as he kept paddling round and\r\nround.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII: The Rescue\r\n\r\nWhen Whitefoot made the heedless jump that landed him in a pail half\r\nfilled with sap, no one else was in the little sugar-house. Whitefoot\r\nwas quite alone. You see, Farmer Brown and Farmer Brown's boy were out\r\ncollecting sap from the trees, and Bowser the Hound was with them.\r\n\r\nFarmer Brown's boy was the first to return. He came in just after\r\nWhitefoot had given up all hope. He went at once to the fire to put\r\nmore wood on. As he finished this job he heard the faintest of little\r\nsqueaks. It was a very pitiful little squeak. Farmer Brown's boy stood\r\nperfectly still and listened. He heard it again. He knew right away that\r\nit was the voice of Whitefoot.\r\n\r\n“Hello!” exclaimed Farmer Brown's boy. “That sounds as if Whitefoot is\r\nin trouble of some kind. I wonder where the little rascal is. I wonder\r\nwhat can have happened to him. I must look into this.” Again Farmer\r\nBrown's boy heard that faint little squeak. It was so faint that he\r\ncouldn't tell where it came from. Hurriedly and anxiously he looked all\r\nover the little sugar-house, stopping every few seconds to listen\r\nfor that pitiful little squeak. It seemed to come from nowhere in\r\nparticular. Also it was growing fainter.\r\n\r\nAt last Farmer Brown's boy happened to stand still close to that tin\r\npail half filled with sap. He heard the faint little squeak again and\r\nwith it a little splash. It was the sound of the little splash that led\r\nhim to look down. In a flash he understood what had happened. He\r\nsaw poor little Whitefoot struggling feebly, and even as he looked\r\nWhitefoot's head went under. He was very nearly drowned.\r\n\r\nStooping quickly, Farmer Brown's boy grabbed Whitefoot's long tail and\r\npulled him out. Whitefoot was so nearly drowned that he didn't have\r\nstrength enough to even kick. A great pity filled the eyes of Farmer\r\nBrown's boy as he held Whitefoot's head down and gently shook him. He\r\nwas trying to shake some of the sap out of Whitefoot. It ran out of\r\nWhitefoot's nose and out of his mouth. Whitefoot began to gasp. Then\r\nFarmer Brown's boy spread his coat close by the fire, rolled Whitefoot\r\nup in his handkerchief and gently placed him on the coat. For some time\r\nWhitefoot lay just gasping. But presently his breath came easier, and\r\nafter a while he was breathing naturally. But he was too weak and tired\r\nto move, so he just lay there while Farmer Brown's boy gently stroked\r\nhis head and told him how sorry he was.\r\n\r\nLittle by little Whitefoot recovered his strength. At last he could sit\r\nup, and finally he began to move about a little, although he was still\r\nwobbly on his legs. Farmer Brown's boy put some bits of food where\r\nWhitefoot could get them, and as he ate, Whitefoot's beautiful soft eyes\r\nwere filled with gratitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX: Two Timid Persons Meet\r\n\r\n   Thus always you will meet life's test--\r\n   To do the thing you can do best.\r\n      --Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nJumper the Hare sat crouched at the foot of a tree in the Green Forest.\r\nHad you happened along there, you would not have seen him. At least,\r\nI doubt if you would. If you had seen him, you probably wouldn't have\r\nknown it. You see, in his white coat Jumper was so exactly the color of\r\nthe snow that he looked like nothing more than a little heap of snow.\r\n\r\nJust in front of Juniper was a little round hole. He gave it no\r\nattention. It didn't interest him in the least. All through the Green\r\nForest were little holes in the snow. Jumper was so used to them that\r\nhe seldom noticed them. So he took no notice of this one until something\r\nmoved down in that hole. Jumper's eyes opened a little wider and he\r\nwatched. A sharp little face with very bright eyes filled that little\r\nround hole. Jumper moved just the tiniest bit, and in a flash that\r\nsharp little face with the bright eyes disappeared. Jumper sat still\r\nand waited. After a long wait the sharp little face with bright eyes\r\nappeared again. “Don't be frightened, Whitefoot,” said Jumper softly. At\r\nthe first word the sharp little face disappeared, but in a moment it was\r\nback, and the sharp little eyes were fixed on Jumper suspiciously. After\r\na long stare the suspicion left them, and out of the little round hole\r\ncame trim little Whitefoot in a soft brown coat with white waistcoat and\r\nwith white feet and a long, slim tail. This winter he was not living in\r\nFarmer Brown's sugarhouse.\r\n\r\n“Gracious, Jumper, how you did scare me!” said he.\r\n\r\nJumper chuckled. “Whitefoot, I believe you are more timid than I am,” he\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n“Why shouldn't I be? I'm ever so much smaller, and I have more enemies,”\r\n retorted Whitefoot.\r\n\r\n“It is true you are smaller, but I am not so sure that you have more\r\nenemies,” replied Jumper thoughtfully. “It sometimes seems to me that I\r\ncouldn't have more, especially in winter.”\r\n\r\n“Name them,” commanded Whitefoot.\r\n\r\n“Hooty the Great Horned Owl, Yowler the Bob Cat, Old Man Coyote, Reddy\r\nFox, Terror the Goshawk, Shadow the Weasel, Billy Mink.” Jumper paused.\r\n\r\n“Is that all?” demanded Whitefoot.\r\n\r\n“Isn't that enough?” retorted Jumper rather sharply.\r\n\r\n“I have all of those and Blacky the Crow and Butcher the Shrike and\r\nSammy Jay in winter, and Buster Hear and Jimmy Skunk and several of the\r\nSnake family in summer,” replied Whitefoot. “It seems to me sometimes as\r\nif I need eyes and ears all over me. Night and day there is always some\r\none hunting for poor little me. And then some folks wonder why I am so\r\ntimid. If I were not as timid as I am, I wouldn't be alive now; I would\r\nhave been caught long ago. Folks may laugh at me for being so easily\r\nfrightened, but I don't care. That is what saves my life a dozen times a\r\nday.”\r\n\r\nJumper looked interested. “I hadn't thought of that,” said he. “I'm a\r\nvery timid person myself, and sometimes I have been ashamed of being so\r\neasily frightened. But come to think of it, I guess you are right; the\r\nmore timid I am, the longer I am likely to live.” Whitefoot suddenly\r\ndarted into his hole. Jumper didn't move, but his eyes widened with\r\nfear. A great white bird had just alighted on a stump a short distance\r\naway. It was Whitey the Snowy Owl, down from the Far North.\r\n\r\n“There is another enemy we both forgot,” thought Jumper, and tried not\r\nto shiver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X: The White Watchers\r\n\r\n   Much may be gained by sitting still\r\n   If you but have the strength of will.\r\n    --Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nJumper the Hare crouched at the foot of a tree in the Green Forest, and\r\na little way from him on a stump sat Whitey the Snowy Owl. Had you been\r\nthere to see them, both would have appeared as white as the snow around\r\nthem unless you had looked very closely. Then you might have seen two\r\nnarrow black lines back of Jumper's head. They were the tips of his\r\nears, for these remain black. And near the upper part of the white mound\r\nwhich was Whitey you might have seen two round yellow spots, his eyes.\r\n\r\nThere they were for all the world like two little heaps of snow. Jumper\r\ndidn't move so much as a hair. Whitey didn't move so much as a feather.\r\nBoth were waiting and watching. Jumper didn't move because he knew that\r\nWhitey was there. Whitey didn't move because he didn't want any one to\r\nknow he was there, and didn't know that Jumper was there. Jumper was\r\nsitting still because he was afraid. Whitey was sitting still because he\r\nwas hungry.\r\n\r\nSo there they sat, each in plain sight of the other but only one seeing\r\nthe other. This was because Juniper had been fortunate enough to see\r\nWhitey alight on that stump. Jumper had been sitting still when Whitey\r\narrived, and so those fierce yellow eyes had not yet seen him. But had\r\nJumper so much as lifted one of those long ears, Whitey would have seen,\r\nand his great claws would have been reaching for Jumper.\r\n\r\nJumper didn't want to sit still. No, indeed! He wanted to run. You know\r\nit is on those long legs of his that Jumper depends almost wholly for\r\nsafety. But there are times for running and times for sitting still, and\r\nthis was a time for sitting still. He knew that Whitey didn't know that\r\nhe was anywhere near. But just the same it was hard, very hard to sit\r\nthere with one he so greatly feared watching so near. It seemed as if\r\nthose fierce yellow eyes of Whitey must see him. They seemed to look\r\nright through him. They made him shake inside.\r\n\r\n“I want to run. I want to run. I want to run,” Jumper kept saying to\r\nhimself. Then he would say, “But I mustn't. I mustn't. I mustn't.” And\r\nso Jumper did the hardest thing in the world,--sat still and stared\r\ndanger in the face. He was sitting still to save his life.\r\n\r\nWhitey the Snowy Owl was sitting still to catch a dinner. I know that\r\nsounds queer, but it was so. He knew that so long as he sat still,\r\nhe was not likely to be seen. It was for this purpose that Old Mother\r\nNature had given him that coat of white. In the Far North, which was\r\nhis real home, everything is white for months and months, and any one\r\ndressed in a dark suit can be seen a long distance. So Whitey had been\r\ngiven that white coat that he might have a better chance to catch food\r\nenough to keep him alive.\r\n\r\nAnd he had learned how to make the best use of it. Yes, indeed, he knew\r\nhow to make the best use of it. It was by doing just what he was doing\r\nnow,--sitting perfectly still. Just before he had alighted on that stump\r\nhe had seen something move at the entrance to a little round hole in the\r\nsnow. He was sure of it.\r\n\r\n“A Mouse,” thought Whitey, and alighted on that stump. “He saw me\r\nflying, but he'll forget about it after a while and will come out again.\r\nHe won't see me then if I don't move. And I won't move until he is far\r\nenough from that hole for me to catch him before he can get back to it.”\r\n\r\nSo the two watchers in white sat without moving for the longest time,\r\none watching for a dinner and the other watching the other watcher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI: Jumper Is In Doubt\r\n\r\n   When doubtful what course to pursue\r\n   'Tis sometimes best to nothing do.\r\n     --Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nJumper the Hare was beginning to feel easier in his mind. He was no\r\nlonger shaking inside. In fact, he was beginning to feel quite safe.\r\nThere he was in plain sight of Whitey the Snowy Owl, sitting motionless\r\non a stump only a short distance away, yet Whitey hadn't seen him.\r\nWhitey had looked straight at him many times, but because Jumper had\r\nnot moved so much as a hair Whitey had mistaken him for a little heap of\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\n“All I have to do is to keep right on sitting perfectly still, and I'll\r\nbe as safe as if Whitey were nowhere about. Yes, sir, I will,” thought\r\nJumper. “By and by he will become tired and fly away. I do hope he'll do\r\nthat before Whitefoot comes out again. If Whitefoot should come out, I\r\ncouldn't warn him because that would draw Whitey's attention to me, and\r\nhe wouldn't look twice at a Wood Mouse when there was a chance to get a\r\nHare for his dinner.\r\n\r\n“This is a queer world. It is so. Old Mother Nature does queer things.\r\nHere she has given me a white coat in winter so that I may not be easily\r\nseen when there is snow on the ground, and at the same time she has\r\ngiven one of those I fear most a white coat so that he may not be easily\r\nseen, either. It certainly is a queer world.”\r\n\r\nJumper forgot that Whitey was only a chance visitor from the Far North\r\nand that it was only once in a great while that he came down there,\r\nwhile up in the Far North where he belonged nearly everybody was dressed\r\nin white.\r\n\r\nJumper hadn't moved once, but once in a while Whitey turned his great\r\nround head for a look all about in every direction. But it was done in\r\nsuch a way that only eyes watching him sharply would have noticed it.\r\nMost of the time he kept his fierce yellow eyes fixed on the little hole\r\nin the snow in which Whitefoot had disappeared. You know Whitey can see\r\nby day quite as well as any other bird.\r\n\r\nJumper, having stopped worrying about himself, began to worry about\r\nWhitefoot. He knew that Whitefoot had seen Whitey arrive on that stump\r\nand that was why he had dodged back into his hole and since then had not\r\neven poked his nose out. But that had been so long ago that by this time\r\nWhitefoot must think that Whitey had gone on about his business, and\r\nJumper expected to see Whitefoot appear any moment. What Jumper didn't\r\nknow was that Whitefoot's bright little eyes had all the time been\r\nwatching Whitey from another little hole in the snow some distance away.\r\nA tunnel led from this little hole to the first little hole.\r\n\r\nSuddenly off among the trees something moved. At least, Jumper thought\r\nhe saw something move. Yes, there it was, a little black spot moving\r\nswiftly this way and that way over the snow. Jumper stared very hard.\r\nAnd then his heart seemed to jump right up in his throat. It did so. He\r\nfelt as if he would choke. That black spot was the tip end of a tail,\r\nthe tail of a small, very slim fellow dressed all in white, the only\r\nother one in all the Green Forest who dresses all in white. It was\r\nShadow the Weasel! In his white winter coat he is called Ermine.\r\n\r\nHe was running this way and that way, back and forth, with his nose to\r\nthe snow. He was hunting, and Jumper knew that sooner or later Shadow\r\nwould find him. Safety from Shadow lay in making the best possible use\r\nof those long legs of his, but to do that would bring Whitey the\r\nOwl swooping after him. What to do Jumper didn't know. And so he did\r\nnothing. It happened to be the wisest thing he could do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII: Whitey The Owl Saves Jumper\r\n\r\n   It often happens in the end\r\n   An enemy may prove a friend.\r\n      --Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nWas ever any one in a worse position than Jumper the Hare? To move would\r\nbe to give himself away to Whitey the Snowy Owl. If he remained where he\r\nwas very likely Shadow the Weasel would find him, and the result would\r\nbe the same as if he were caught by Whitey the Owl. Neither Whitey nor\r\nShadow knew he was there, but it would be only a few minutes before one\r\nof them knew it. At least, that is the way it looked to Jumper.\r\n\r\nWhitey wouldn't know it unless he moved, but Shadow the Weasel would\r\nfind his tracks, and his nose would lead him straight there. Back and\r\nforth, back and forth, this way, that way and the other way, just a\r\nlittle distance off, Shadow was running with his nose to the snow. He\r\nwas hunting--hunting for the scent of some one whom he could kill. In a\r\nfew minutes he would be sure to find where Jumper had been, and then his\r\nnose would lead him straight to that tree at the foot of which Jumper\r\nwas crouching.\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer came Shadow. He was slim and trim and didn't look at\r\nall terrible. Yet there was no one in all the Green Forest more feared\r\nby the little people in fur, by Jumper, by Peter Rabbit, by Whitefoot,\r\neven by Chatterer the Red Squirrel.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” thought Jumper, “he won't find my scent after all. Perhaps\r\nhe'll go in another direction.” But all the time Jumper felt in his\r\nbones that Shadow would find that scent. “When he does, I'll run,” said\r\nJumper to himself. “I'll have at least a chance to dodge Whitey. I am\r\nafraid he will catch me, but I'll have a chance. I won't have any chance\r\nat all if Shadow finds me.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly Shadow stopped running and sat up to look about with fierce\r\nlittle eyes, all the time testing the air with his nose. Jumper's heart\r\nsank. He knew that Shadow had caught a faint scent of some one. Then\r\nShadow began to run back and forth once more, but more carefully than\r\nbefore. And then he started straight for where Jumper was crouching!\r\nJumper knew then that Shadow had found his trail.\r\n\r\nJumper drew a long breath and settled his long hind feet for a great\r\njump, hoping to so take Whitey the Owl by surprise that he might be able\r\nto get away. And as Jumper did this, he looked over to that stump where\r\nWhitey had been sitting so long. Whitey was just leaving it on his great\r\nsilent wings, and his fierce yellow eyes were fixed in the direction of\r\nShadow the Weasel. He had seen that moving black spot which was the tip\r\nof Shadow's tail.\r\n\r\nJumper didn't have time to jump before Whitey was swooping down at\r\nShadow. So Juniper just kept still and watched with eyes almost popping\r\nfrom his head with fear and excitement.\r\n\r\nShadow hadn't seen Whitey until just as Whitey was reaching for him with\r\nhis great cruel claws. Now if there is any one who can move more quickly\r\nthan Shadow the Weasel I don't know who it is. Whitey's claws closed on\r\nnothing but snow; Shadow had dodged. Then began a game, Whitey swooping\r\nand Shadow dodging, and all the time they were getting farther and\r\nfarther from where Jumper was.\r\n\r\nThe instant it was safe to do so, Jumper took to his long heels and the\r\nway he disappeared, lipperty-lipperty-lip, was worth seeing. Whitey the\r\nSnowy Owl had saved him from Shadow the Weasel and didn't know it. An\r\nenemy had proved to be a friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII: Whitefoot Decides Quickly\r\n\r\n   Your mind made up a certain way\r\n   Be swift to act; do not delay.\r\n      --Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nWhen Whitefoot had discovered Whitey the Snowy Owl, he had dodged down\r\nin the little hole in the snow beside which he had been sitting. He had\r\nnot been badly frightened. But he was somewhat upset. Yes, sir, he was\r\nsomewhat upset. You see, he had so many enemies to watch out for, and\r\nhere was another.\r\n\r\n“Just as if I didn't have troubles enough without having this white\r\nrobber to add to them,” grumbled Whitefoot. “Why doesn't he stay where\r\nhe belongs, way up in the Far North? It must be that food is scarce up\r\nthere. Well, now that I know he is here, he will have to be smarter than\r\nI think he is to catch me. I hope Jumper the Hare will have sense enough\r\nto keep perfectly still. I've sometimes envied him his long legs, but I\r\nguess I am better off than he is, at that. Once he has been seen by an\r\nenemy, only those long legs of his can save him, but I have a hundred\r\nhiding-places down under the snow. Whitey is watching the hole where\r\nI disappeared; he thinks I'll come out there again after a while. I'll\r\nfool him.”\r\n\r\nWhitefoot scampered along through a little tunnel and presently very\r\ncautiously peeped out of another little round hole in the snow. Sure\r\nenough, there was Whitey the Snowy Owl back to him on a stump, watching\r\nthe hole down which he had disappeared a few minutes before. Whitefoot\r\ngrinned. Then he looked over to where he had last seen Jumper. Jumper\r\nwas still there; it was clear that he hadn't moved, and so Whitey hadn't\r\nseen him. Again Whitefoot grinned. Then he settled himself to watch\r\npatiently for Whitey to become tired of watching that hole and fly away.\r\n\r\nSo it was that Whitefoot saw all that happened. He saw Whitey suddenly\r\nsail out on silent wings from that stump and swoop with great claws\r\nreaching for some one. And then he saw who that some one was,--Shadow\r\nthe Weasel! He saw Shadow dodge in the very nick of time. Then he\r\nwatched Whitey swoop again and again as Shadow dodged this way and that\r\nway. Finally both disappeared amongst the trees. Then he turned just\r\nin time to see Jumper the Hare bounding away with all the speed of his\r\nwonderful, long legs.\r\n\r\nFear, the greatest fear he had known for a long time, took possession\r\nof Whitefoot. “Shadow the Weasel!” he gasped and had such a thing been\r\npossible he certainly would have turned pale. “Whitey won't catch him;\r\nShadow is too quick for him. And when Whitey has given up and flown\r\naway, Shadow will come back. He probably had found the tracks of Jumper\r\nthe Hare and he will come back. I know him; he'll come back. Jumper is\r\nsafe enough from him now, because he has such a long start, but Shadow\r\nwill be sure to find one of my holes in the snow. Oh, dear! Oh, dear!\r\nWhat shall I do?”\r\n\r\nYou see Shadow the Weasel is the one enemy that can follow Whitefoot\r\ninto most of his hiding-places.\r\n\r\nFor a minute or two Whitefoot sat there, shaking with fright. Then he\r\nmade up his mind. “I'll get away from here before he returns,” thought\r\nWhitefoot. “I've got to. I've spent a comfortable winter here so far,\r\nbut there will be no safety for me here any longer. I don't know where\r\nto go, but anywhere will be better than here now.”\r\n\r\nWithout waiting another second, Whitefoot scampered away. And how he did\r\nhope that his scent would have disappeared by the time Shadow returned.\r\nIf it hadn't, there would be little hope for him and he knew it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV: Shadows Return\r\n\r\n   He little gains and has no pride\r\n   Who from his purpose turns aside.\r\n     --Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nShadow the Weasel believes in persistence. When he sets out to do a\r\nthing, he keeps at it until it is done or he knows for a certainty it\r\ncannot be done. He is not easily discouraged. This is one reason he is\r\nso feared by the little people he delights to hunt. They know that once\r\nhe gets on their trail, they will be fortunate indeed if they escape\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhen Whitey the Snowy Owl swooped at him and so nearly caught him, he\r\nwas not afraid as he dodged this way and that way. Any other of the\r\nlittle people with the exception of his cousin, Billy Mink, would have\r\nbeen frightened half to death. But Shadow was simply angry. He was angry\r\nthat any one should try to catch him. He was still more angry because\r\nhis hunt for Jumper the Hare was interfered with. You see, he had just\r\nfound Jumper's trail when Whitey swooped at him.\r\n\r\nSo Shadow's little eyes grew red with rage as he dodged this way and\r\nthat and was gradually driven away from the place where he had found the\r\ntrail of Jumper the Hare. At last he saw a hole in an old log and into\r\nthis he darted. Whitey couldn't get him there. Whitey knew this and he\r\nknew, too, that waiting for Shadow to come out again would be a waste of\r\ntime. So Whitey promptly flew away.\r\n\r\nHardly had he disappeared when Shadow popped out of that hole, for he\r\nhad been peeping out and watching Whitey. Without a moment's pause\r\nhe turned straight back for the place where he had found the trail of\r\nJumper the Hare. He had no intention of giving up that hunt just because\r\nhe had been driven away. Straight to the very spot where Whitey had\r\nfirst swooped at him he ran, and there once more his keen little nose\r\ntook up the trail of Jumper. It led him straight to the foot of the tree\r\nwhere Jumper had crouched so long.\r\n\r\nBut, as you know, Jumper wasn't there then. Shadow ran in a circle and\r\npresently he found where Jumper had landed on the snow at the end\r\nof that first bound. Shadow snarled. He understood exactly what had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n“Jumper was under that tree when that white robber from the Far North\r\ntried to catch me, and he took that chance to leave in a hurry. I can\r\ntell that by the length of this jump. Probably he is still going. It is\r\nuseless to follow him because he has too long a start,” said Shadow, and\r\nhe snarled again in rage and disappointment.\r\n\r\nThen, for such is his way, he wasted no more time or thought on Jumper\r\nthe Hare. Instead he began to look for other trails. So it was that he\r\nfound one of the little holes of Whitefoot the Wood Mouse.\r\n\r\n“Ha! So this is where Whitefoot has been living this winter!” he\r\nexclaimed. Once more his eyes glowed red, but this time with eagerness\r\nand the joy of the hunt. He plunged down into that little hole in the\r\nsnow. Down there the scent of Whitefoot was strong. Shadow followed it\r\nuntil it led out of another little hole in the snow. But there he lost\r\nit. You see, it was so long since Whitefoot had hurriedly left that the\r\nscent on the surface had disappeared.\r\n\r\nShadow ran swiftly this way and that way in a big circle, but he\r\ncouldn't find Whitefoot's trail again. Snarling with anger and\r\ndisappointment, he returned to the little hole in the snow and vanished.\r\nThen he followed all Whitefoot's little tunnels. He found Whitefoot's\r\nnest. He found his store of seeds. But he didn't find Whitefoot.\r\n\r\n“He'll come back,” muttered Shadow, and curled up in Whitefoot's nest to\r\nwait.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV: Whitefoots Dreadful Journey\r\n\r\n   Danger may be anywhere,\r\n   So I expect it everywhere.\r\n      --Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nWhitefoot the Wood Mouse was terribly frightened. Yes, sir, he was\r\nterribly frightened. It was a long, long time since he had been as\r\nfrightened as he now was. He is used to frights, is Whitefoot. He has\r\nthem every day and every night, but usually they are sudden frights,\r\nquickly over and as quickly forgotten.\r\n\r\nThis fright was different. You see Whitefoot had caught a glimpse of\r\nShadow the Weasel. And he knew that if Shadow returned he would be sure\r\nto find the little round holes in the snow that led down to Whitefoot's\r\nprivate little tunnels underneath.\r\n\r\nThe only thing for Whitefoot to do was to get just as far from that\r\nplace as he could before Shadow should return. And so poor little\r\nWhitefoot started out on a journey that was to take him he knew not\r\nwhere. All he could do was to go and go and go until he could find a\r\nsafe hiding-place.\r\n\r\nMy, my, but that was a dreadful journey! Every time a twig snapped,\r\nWhitefoot's heart seemed to jump right up in his throat. Every time he\r\nsaw a moving shadow, and the branches of the trees moving in the wind\r\nwere constantly making moving shadows on the snow, he dodged behind\r\na tree trunk or under a piece of bark or wherever he could find a\r\nhiding-place.\r\n\r\nYou see, Whitefoot has so many enemies always looking for him that he\r\nhides whenever he sees anything moving. When at home, he is forever\r\ndodging in and out of his hiding-places. So, because everything was\r\nstrange to him, and because of the great fear of Shadow the Weasel, he\r\nsuspected everything that moved and every sound he heard. For a long way\r\nno one saw him, for no one was about. Yet all that way Whitefoot\r\ntwisted and dodged and darted from place to place and was just as badly\r\nfrightened as if there had been enemies all about.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear! Oh, dear me!” he kept saying over and over to himself.\r\n“Wherever shall I go? Whatever shall I do? However shall I get enough to\r\neat? I won't dare go back to get food from my little storehouses, and I\r\nshall have to live in a strange place where I won't know where to look\r\nfor food. I am getting tired. My legs ache. I 'm getting hungry. I want\r\nmy nice, warm, soft bed. Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear me!”\r\n\r\nBut in spite of his frights, Whitefoot kept on. You see, he was more\r\nafraid to stop than he was to go on. He just had to get as far from\r\nShadow the Weasel as he could. Being such a little fellow, what would be\r\na short distance for you or me is a long distance for Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nAnd so that journey was to him very long indeed. Of course, it seemed\r\nlonger because of the constant frights which came one right after\r\nanother. It really was a terrible journey. Yet if he had only known it,\r\nthere wasn't a thing along the whole way to be afraid of. You know it\r\noften happens that people are frightened more by what they don't know\r\nthan by what they do know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI: Whitefoot Climbs A Tree\r\n\r\n    I'd rather be frightened With no cause for fear\r\n    Than fearful of nothing When danger is near.\r\n      --Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nWhitefoot kept on going and going. Every time he thought that he was so\r\ntired he must stop, he would think of Shadow the Weasel and then go on\r\nagain. By and by he became so tired that not even the thought of Shadow\r\nthe Weasel could make him go much farther. So he began to look about for\r\na safe hiding-place in which to rest.\r\n\r\nNow the home which he had left had been a snug little room beneath the\r\nroots of a certain old stump. There he had lived for a long time in the\r\ngreatest comfort. Little tunnels led to his storehouses and up to the\r\nsurface of the snow. It had been a splendid place and one in which he\r\nhad felt perfectly safe until Shadow the Weasel had appeared. Had you\r\nseen him playing about there, you would have thought him one of the\r\nlittle people of the ground, like his cousin Danny Meadow Mouse.\r\n\r\nBut Whitefoot is quite as much at home in trees as on the ground. In\r\nfact, he is quite as much at home in trees as is Chatterer the Red\r\nSquirrel, and a lot more at home in trees than is Striped Chipmunk,\r\nalthough Striped Chipmunk belongs to the Squirrel family. So now that\r\nhe must find a hiding-place, Whitefoot decided that he would feel much\r\nsafer in a tree than on the ground.\r\n\r\n“If only I can find a hollow tree,” whimpered Whitefoot. “I will feel\r\never so much safer in a tree than hiding in or near the ground in a\r\nstrange place.”\r\n\r\nSo Whitefoot began to look for a dead tree. You see, he knew that there\r\nwas more likely to be a hollow in a dead tree than in a living tree. By\r\nand by he came to a tall, dead tree. He knew it was a dead tree, because\r\nthere was no bark on it. But, of course, he couldn't tell whether or not\r\nthat tree was hollow. I mean he couldn't tell from the ground.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear!” he whimpered again. “Oh, dear! I suppose I will have to\r\nclimb this, and I am so tired. It ought to be hollow. There ought to\r\nbe splendid holes in it. It is just the kind of a tree that Drummer the\r\nWoodpecker likes to make his house in. I shall be terribly disappointed\r\nif I don't find one of his houses somewhere in it, but I wish I hadn't\r\ngot to climb it to find out. Well, here goes.”\r\n\r\nHe looked anxiously this way. He looked anxiously that way. He looked\r\nanxiously the other way. In fact, he looked anxiously every way.\r\n\r\nBut he saw no one and nothing to be afraid of, and so he started up the\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nHe was half-way up when, glancing down, he saw a shadow moving across\r\nthe snow. Once more Whitefoot's heart seemed to jump right up in his\r\nthroat. That shadow was the shadow of some one flying. There couldn't be\r\nthe least bit of doubt about it. Whitefoot flattened himself against the\r\nside of the tree and peeked around it. He was just in time to see a gray\r\nand black and white bird almost the size of Sammy Jay alight in the very\r\nnext tree. He had come along near the ground and then risen sharply into\r\nthe tree. His bill was black, and there was just a tiny hook on the end\r\nof it. Whitefoot knew who it was. It was Butcher the Shrike. Whitefoot\r\nshivered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII: Whitefoot Finds A Hole Just In Time\r\n\r\n   Just in time, not just too late,\r\n   Will make you master of your fate.\r\n     --Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nWhitefoot, half-way up that dead tree, flattened himself against the\r\ntrunk and, with his heart going pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat with fright, peered\r\naround the tree at an enemy he had not seen for so long that he had\r\nquite forgotten there was such a one. It was Butcher the Shrike. Often\r\nhe is called just Butcher Bird. He did not look at all terrible. He was\r\nnot quite as big as Sammy Jay. He had no terrible claws like the Hawks\r\nand Owls. There was a tiny hook at the end of his black bill, but it\r\nwasn't big enough to look very dreadful. But you can not always judge a\r\nperson by looks, and Whitefoot knew that Butcher was one to be feared.\r\n\r\nSo his heart went pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat as he wondered if Butcher had\r\nseen him. He didn't have to wait long to find out. Butcher flew to a\r\ntree back of Whitefoot and then straight at him. Whitefoot dodged around\r\nto the other side of the tree. Then began a dreadful game. At least,\r\nit was dreadful to Whitefoot. This way and that way around the trunk of\r\nthat tree he dodged, while Butcher did his best to catch him.\r\n\r\nWhitefoot would not have minded this so much, had he not been so tired,\r\nand had he known of a hiding-place close at hand. But he was tired, very\r\ntired, for you remember he had had what was a very long and terrible\r\njourney to him. He had felt almost too tired to climb that tree in the\r\nfirst place to see if it had any holes in it higher up. Now he didn't\r\nknow whether to keep on going up or to go down. Two or three times he\r\ndodged around the tree without doing either. Then he decided to go up.\r\n\r\nNow Butcher was enjoying this game of dodge. If he should catch\r\nWhitefoot, he would have a good dinner. If he didn't catch Whitefoot, he\r\nwould simply go hungry a little longer. So you see, there was a very big\r\ndifference in the feelings of Whitefoot and Butcher. Whitefoot had his\r\nlife to lose, while Butcher had only a dinner to lose.\r\n\r\nDodging this way and dodging that way, Whitefoot climbed higher and\r\nhigher. Twice he whisked around that tree trunk barely in time. All the\r\ntime he was growing more and more tired, and more and more discouraged.\r\nSupposing he should find no hole in that tree!\r\n\r\n“There must be one. There must be one,” he kept saying over and over to\r\nhimself, to keep his courage up. “I can't keep dodging much longer. If\r\nI don't find a hole pretty soon, Butcher will surely catch me. Oh, dear!\r\nOh, dear!”\r\n\r\nJust above Whitefoot was a broken branch. Only the stub of it remained.\r\nThe next time he dodged around the trunk he found himself just below\r\nthat stub. Oh, joy! There, close under that stub, was a round hole.\r\nWhitefoot didn't hesitate a second. He didn't wait to find out whether\r\nor not any one was in that hole. He didn't even think that there might\r\nbe some one in there. With a tiny little squeak of relief he darted in.\r\nHe was just in time. He was just in the nick of time. Butcher struck at\r\nhim and just missed him as he disappeared in that hole. Whitefoot had\r\nsaved his life and Butcher had missed a dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII: An Unpleasant Surprise\r\n\r\n   Be careful never to be rude\r\n   Enough to thoughtlessly intrude.\r\n     --Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nIf ever anybody in the Great World felt relief and thankfulness, it was\r\nWhitefoot when he dodged into that hole in the dead tree just as Butcher\r\nthe Shrike all but caught him. For a few minutes he did nothing but\r\npant, for he was quite out of breath.\r\n\r\n“I was right,” he said over and over to himself, “I was right. I was\r\nsure there must be a hole in this tree. It is one of the old houses of\r\nDrummer the Woodpecker. Now I am safe.”\r\n\r\nPresently he peeped out. He wanted to see if Butcher was watching\r\noutside. He was just in time to see Butcher's gray and black and white\r\ncoat disappearing among the trees. Butcher was not foolish enough to\r\nwaste time watching for Whitefoot to come out. Whitefoot sighed happily.\r\nFor the first time since he had started on his dreadful journey he felt\r\nsafe. Nothing else mattered. He was hungry, but he didn't mind that. He\r\nwas willing to go hungry for the sake of being safe.\r\n\r\nWhitefoot watched until Butcher was out of sight. Then he turned to\r\nsee what that house was like. Right away he discovered that there was a\r\nsoft, warm bed in it. It was made of leaves, grass, moss, and the lining\r\nof bark. It was a very fine bed indeed.\r\n\r\n“My, my, my, but I am lucky,” said Whitefoot to himself. “I wonder who\r\ncould have made this fine bed. I certainly shall sleep comfortably here.\r\nGoodness knows, I need a rest. If I can find food enough near here, I'll\r\nmake this my home. I couldn't ask for a better one.”\r\n\r\nChuckling happily, Whitefoot began to pull away the top of that bed so\r\nas to get to the middle of it. And then he got a surprise. It was an\r\nunpleasant surprise. It was a most unpleasant surprise. There was some\r\none in that bed! Yes, sir, there was some one curled up in a little\r\nround ball in the middle of that fine bed. It was some one with a coat\r\nof the softest, finest fur. Can you guess who it was? It was Timmy the\r\nFlying Squirrel.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Whitefoot as if his heart flopped right over. You see at\r\nfirst he didn't recognize Timmy. Whitefoot is himself so very timid that\r\nhis thought was to run; to get out of there as quickly as possible. But\r\nhe had no place to run to, so he hesitated. Never in all his life had\r\nWhitefoot had a greater disappointment. He knew now that this splendid\r\nhouse was not for him.\r\n\r\nTimmy the Flying Squirrel didn't move. He remained curled up in a soft\r\nlittle ball. He was asleep. Whitefoot remembered that Timmy sleeps\r\nduring the day and seldom comes out until the Black Shadows come\r\ncreeping out from the Purple Hills at the close of day. Whitefoot felt\r\neasier in his mind then. Timmy was so sound asleep that he knew nothing\r\nof his visitor. And so Whitefoot felt safe in staying long enough to get\r\nrested. Then he would go out and hunt for another home.\r\n\r\nSo down in the middle of that soft, warm bed Timmy the Flying Squirrel,\r\ncurled up in a little round ball with his flat tail wrapped around him,\r\nslept peacefully, and on top of that soft bed Whitefoot the Wood Mouse\r\nrested and wondered what he should do next. Not in all the Green Forest\r\ncould two more timid little people be found than the two in that old\r\nhome of Drummer the Woodpecker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX: Whitefoot Finds A Home At Last\r\n\r\n   True independence he has known\r\n   Whose home has been his very own.\r\n     --Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nCurled up in his splendid warm bed, Timmy the Flying Squirrel slept\r\npeacefully. He didn't know he had a visitor. He didn't know that on top\r\nof that same bed lay Whitefoot the Wood Mouse. Whitefoot wasn't asleep.\r\nNo, indeed! Whitefoot was too worried to sleep. He knew he couldn't stay\r\nin that fine house because it belonged to Timmy. He knew that as soon as\r\nTimmy awoke, he, Whitefoot, would have to get out. Where should he go?\r\nHe wished he knew. How he did long for the old home he had left. But\r\nwhen he thought of that, he remembered Shadow the Weasel. It was better\r\nto be homeless than to feel that at any minute Shadow the Weasel might\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nIt was getting late in the afternoon. Before long, jolly, round, red Mr.\r\nSun would go to bed behind the Purple Hills, and the Black Shadows would\r\ncome creeping through the Green Forest. Then Timmy the Flying Squirrel\r\nwould awake. “It won't do for me to be here then,” said Whitefoot to\r\nhimself. “I must find some other place before he wakes. If only I knew\r\nthis part of the Green Forest I might know where to go. As it is, I\r\nshall have to go hunt for a new home and trust to luck. Did ever a poor\r\nlittle Mouse have so much trouble?”\r\n\r\nAfter awhile Whitefoot felt rested and peeped out of the doorway. No\r\nenemy was to be seen anywhere. Whitefoot crept out and climbed a little\r\nhigher up in the tree. Presently he found another hole. He peeped inside\r\nand listened long and carefully. He didn't intend to make the mistake of\r\ngoing into another house where some one might be living.\r\n\r\nAt last, sure that there was no one in there, he crept in. Then he made\r\na discovery. There were beech nuts in there and there were seeds.\r\n\r\nIt was a storehouse! Whitefoot knew at once that it must be Timmy's\r\nstorehouse. Right away he realized how very, very hungry he was. Of\r\ncourse, he had no right to any of those seeds or nuts. Certainly not!\r\nThat is, he wouldn't have had any right had he been a boy or girl. But\r\nit is the law of the Green Forest that whatever any one finds he may\r\nhelp himself to if he can.\r\n\r\nSo Whitefoot began to fill his empty little stomach with some of those\r\nseeds. He ate and ate and ate and quite forgot all his troubles. Just\r\nas he felt that he hadn't room for another seed, he heard the sound of\r\nclaws outside on the trunk of the tree. In a flash he knew that Timmy\r\nthe Flying Squirrel was awake, and that it wouldn't do to be found in\r\nthere by him. In a jiffy Whitefoot was outside. He was just in time.\r\nTimmy was almost up to the entrance.\r\n\r\n“Hi, there!” cried Timmy. “What were you doing in my storehouse?”\r\n\r\n“I--I--I was looking for a new home,” stammered Whitefoot.\r\n\r\n“You mean you were stealing some of my food,” snapped Timmy\r\nsuspiciously.\r\n\r\n“I--I--I did take a few seeds because I was almost starved. But truly I\r\nwas looking for a new home,” replied Whitefoot.\r\n\r\n“What was the matter with your old home?” demanded Timmy.\r\n\r\nThen Whitefoot told Timmy all about how he had been obliged to leave his\r\nold home because of Shadow the Weasel, of the terrible journey he had\r\nhad, and how he didn't know where to go or what to do. Timmy listened\r\nsuspiciously at first, but soon he made up his mind that Whitefoot was\r\ntelling the truth. The mere mention of Shadow the Weasel made him very\r\nsober.\r\n\r\nHe scratched his nose thoughtfully. “Over in that tall, dead stub you\r\ncan see from here is an old home of mine,” said he. “No one lives in it\r\nnow. I guess you can live there until you can find a better home. But\r\nremember to keep away from my storehouse.”\r\n\r\nSo it was that Whitefoot found a new home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX: Whitefoot Makes Himself At Home\r\n\r\n   Look not too much on that behind\r\n   Lest to the future you be blind.\r\n     --Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nWhitefoot didn't wait to be told twice of that empty house. He thanked\r\nTimmy and then scampered over to that stub as fast as his legs would\r\ntake him. Up the stub he climbed, and near the top he found a little\r\nround hole. Timmy had said no one was living there now, and so Whitefoot\r\ndidn't hesitate to pop inside.\r\n\r\nThere was even a bed in there. It was an old bed, but it was dry and\r\nsoft. It was quite clear that no one had been in there for a long time.\r\nWith a little sigh of pure happiness, Whitefoot curled up in that bed\r\nfor the sleep he so much needed. His stomach was full, and once more he\r\nfelt safe. The very fact that this was an old house in which no one had\r\nlived for a long time made it safer. Whitefoot knew that those who lived\r\nin that part of the Green Forest probably knew that no one lived in that\r\nold stub, and so no one was likely to visit it.\r\n\r\nHe was so tired that he slept all night. Whitefoot is one of those who\r\nsleeps when he feels sleepy, whether it be by day or night. He prefers\r\nthe night to be out and about in, because he feels safer then, but\r\nhe often comes out by day. So when he awoke in the early morning, he\r\npromptly went out for a look about and to get acquainted with his new\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nJust a little way off was the tall, dead tree in which Timmy the Flying\r\nSquirrel had his home. Timmy was nowhere to be seen. You see, he had\r\nbeen out most of the night and had gone to bed to sleep through the day.\r\nWhitefoot thought longingly of the good things in Timmy's storehouse in\r\nthat same tree, but decided that it would be wisest to keep away from\r\nthere. So he scurried about to see what he could find for a breakfast.\r\nIt didn't take him long to find some pine cones in which a few seeds\r\nwere still clinging. These would do nicely. Whitefoot ate what he wanted\r\nand then carried some of them back to his new home in the tall stub.\r\n\r\nThen he went to work to tear to pieces the old bed in there and make it\r\nover to suit himself. It was an old bed of Timmy the Flying Squirrel,\r\nfor you know this was Timmy's old house.\r\n\r\nWhitefoot soon had the bed made over to suit him. And when this was done\r\nhe felt quite at home. Then he started out to explore all about within\r\na short distance of the old stub. He wanted to know every hole and every\r\npossible hiding-place all around, for it is on such knowledge that his\r\nlife depends.\r\n\r\nWhen at last he returned home he was very well satisfied. “It is going\r\nto be a good place to live,” said he to himself. “There are plenty of\r\nhiding-places and I am going to be able to find enough to eat. It will\r\nbe very nice to have Timmy the Flying Squirrel for a neighbor. I am sure\r\nhe and I will get along together very nicely. I don't believe Shadow\r\nthe Weasel, even if he should come around here, would bother to climb\r\nup this old stub. He probably would expect to find me living down in the\r\nground or close to it, anyway. I certainly am glad that I am such a good\r\nclimber. Now if Buster Bear doesn't come along in the spring and pull\r\nthis old stub over, I'll have as fine a home as any one could ask for.”\r\n\r\nAnd then, because happily it is the way with the little people of the\r\nGreen Forest and the Green Meadows, Whitefoot forgot all about his\r\nterrible journey and the dreadful time he had had in finding his new\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI: Whitefoot Envies Timmy\r\n\r\n   A useless thing is envy;\r\n      A foolish thing to boot.\r\n   Why should a Fox who has a bark\r\n      Want like an Owl to hoot?\r\n\r\nWhitefoot was beginning to feel quite at home. He would have been wholly\r\ncontented but for one thing,--he had no well-filled storehouse. This\r\nmeant that each day he must hunt for his food.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't that Whitefoot minded hunting for food. He would have done\r\nthat anyway, even though he had had close at hand a store-house with\r\nplenty in it. But he would have felt easier in his mind. He would have\r\nhad the comfortable feeling that if the weather turned so bad that he\r\ncould not easily get out and about, he would not have to go hungry.\r\n\r\nBut Whitefoot is a happy little fellow and wisely made the best of\r\nthings. At first he came out very little by day. He knew that there were\r\nmany sharp eyes watching for him, and that he was more likely to be seen\r\nin the light of day than when the Black Shadows had crept all through\r\nthe Green Forest.\r\n\r\nHe would peek out of his doorway and watch for chance visitors in the\r\ndaytime. Twice he saw Butcher the Shrike alight a short distance from\r\nthe tree in which Timmy lived. He knew Butcher had not forgotten that\r\nhe had chased a badly frightened Mouse into a hole in that tree. Once he\r\nsaw Whitey the Snowy Owl and so knew that Whitey had not yet returned to\r\nthe Far North. Once Reddy Fox trotted along right past the foot of the\r\nold stub in which Whitefoot lived, and didn't even suspect that he\r\nwas anywhere near. Twice he saw Old Man Coyote trotting past, and once\r\nTerror the Goshawk alighted on that very stub, and sat there for half an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nSo Whitefoot formed the habit of doing just what Timmy the Flying\r\nSquirrel did; he remained in his house for most of the day and came out\r\nwhen the Black Shadows began to creep in among the trees. Timmy came out\r\nabout the same time, and they had become the best of friends.\r\n\r\nNow Whitefoot is not much given to envying others, but as night after\r\nnight he watched Timmy a little envy crept into his heart in spite of\r\nall he could do. Timmy would nimbly climb to the top of a tree and then\r\njump. Down he would come in a long beautiful glide, for all the world as\r\nif he were sliding on the air.\r\n\r\nThe first time Whitefoot saw him do it he held his breath. He really\r\ndidn't know what to make of it. The nearest tree to the one from which\r\nTimmy had jumped was so far away that it didn't seem possible any one\r\nwithout wings could reach it without first going to the ground.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” squeaked Whitefoot. “Oh! he'll kill himself! He surely will kill\r\nhimself! He'll break his neck!” But Timmy did nothing of the kind. He\r\nsailed down, down, down and alighted on that distant tree a foot or two\r\nfrom the bottom; and without stopping a second scampered up to the top\r\nof that tree and once more jumped. Whitefoot had hard work to believe\r\nhis own eyes. Timmy seemed to be jumping just for the pleasure of it. As\r\na matter of fact, he was. He was getting his evening exercise.\r\n\r\nWhitefoot sighed. “I wish I could jump like that,” said he to himself.\r\n“I wouldn't ever be afraid of anybody if I could jump like that. I envy\r\nTimmy. I do so.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII: Timmy Proves To Be A True Neighbor\r\n\r\n   He proves himself a neighbor true\r\n   Who seeks a kindly deed to do.\r\n     --Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nOccasionally Timmy the Flying Squirrel came over to visit Whitefoot. If\r\nWhitefoot was in his house he always knew when Timmy arrived. He would\r\nhear a soft thump down near the bottom of the tall stub. He would know\r\ninstantly that thump was made by Timmy striking the foot of the stub\r\nafter a long jump from the top of a tree. Whitefoot would poke his head\r\nout of his doorway and there, sure enough, would be Timmy scrambling up\r\ntowards him.\r\n\r\nWhitefoot had grown to admire Timmy with all his might. It seemed to\r\nhim that Timmy was the most wonderful of all the people he knew. You see\r\nthere was none of the others who could jump as Timmy could. Timmy on his\r\npart enjoyed having Whitefoot for a neighbor. Few of the little people\r\nof the Green Forest are more timid than Timmy the Flying Squirrel, but\r\nhere was one beside whom Timmy actually felt bold. It was such a new\r\nfeeling that Timmy enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nSo it was that in the dusk of early evening, just after the Black\r\nShadows had come creeping out from the Purple Hills across the Green\r\nMeadows and through the Green Forest, these two little neighbors would\r\nstart out to hunt for food. Whitefoot never went far from the tall,\r\ndead stub in which he was now living. He didn't dare to. He wanted to be\r\nwhere at the first sign of danger he could scamper back there to safety.\r\nTimmy would go some distance, but he was seldom gone long. He liked to\r\nbe where he could watch and talk with Whitefoot. You see Timmy is very\r\nmuch like other people,--he likes to gossip a little.\r\n\r\nOne evening Whitefoot had found it hard work to find enough food to fill\r\nhis stomach. He had kept going a little farther and a little farther\r\nfrom home. Finally he was farther from it than he had ever been before.\r\nTimmy had filled his stomach and from near the top of a tree was\r\nwatching Whitefoot. Suddenly what seemed like a great Black Shadow\r\nfloated right over the tree in which Timmy was sitting, and stopped on\r\nthe top of a tall, dead tree. It was Hooty the Owl, and it was simply\r\ngood fortune that Timmy happened to see him. Timmy did not move. He knew\r\nthat he was safe so long as he kept perfectly still. He knew that Hooty\r\ndidn't know he was there. Unless he moved, those great eyes of Hooty's,\r\nwonderful as they were, would not see him.\r\n\r\nTimmy looked over to where he had last seen Whitefoot. There he was\r\npicking out seeds from a pine cone on the ground. The trunk of a tree\r\nwas between him and Hooty. But Timmy knew that Whitefoot hadn't seen\r\nHooty, and that any minute he might run out from behind that tree. If he\r\ndid Hooty would see him, and silently as a shadow would swoop down and\r\ncatch him. What was to be done?\r\n\r\n“It's no business of mine,” said Timmy to himself. “Whitefoot must look\r\nout for himself. It is no business of mine at all. Perhaps Hooty will\r\nfly away before Whitefoot moves. I don't want anything to happen to\r\nWhitefoot, but if something does, it will be his own fault; he should\r\nkeep better watch.”\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes nothing happened. Then Whitefoot finished the last\r\nseed in that cone and started to look for more. Timmy knew that in\r\na moment Hooty would see Whitefoot. What do you think Timmy did? He\r\njumped. Yes, sir, he jumped. Down, down, down, straight past the tree\r\non which sat Hooty the Owl, Timmy sailed. Hooty saw him. Of course. He\r\ncouldn't help but see him. He spread his great wings and was after Timmy\r\nin an instant. Timmy struck near the foot of a tree and without wasting\r\na second darted around to the other side. He was just in time. Hooty was\r\nalready reaching for him. Up the tree ran Timmy and jumped again. Again\r\nHooty was too late. And so Timmy led Hooty the Owl away from Whitefoot\r\nthe Wood Mouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII: Whitefoot Spends A Dreadful Night\r\n\r\n   Pity those who suffer fright\r\n   In the dark and stilly night.\r\n     --Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nOne night of his life Whitefoot will never forget so long as he lives.\r\nEven now it makes him shiver just to think of it. Yes, sir, he shivers\r\neven now whenever he thinks of that night. The Black Shadows had come\r\nearly that evening, so that it was quite dusk when Whitefoot crept out\r\nof his snug little bed and climbed up to the round hole which was the\r\ndoorway of his home. He had just poked his nose out that little round\r\ndoorway when there was the most terrible sound. It seemed to him as if\r\nit was in his very ears, so loud and terrible was it. It frightened him\r\nso that he simply let go and tumbled backward down inside his house. Of\r\ncourse it didn't hurt him any, for he landed on his soft bed.\r\n\r\n“Whooo-hoo-hoo, whooo-hoo!” came that terrible sound again, and\r\nWhitefoot shook until his little teeth rattled. At least, that is the\r\nway it seemed to him. It was the voice of Hooty the Owl, and Whitefoot\r\nknew that Hooty was sitting on the top of that very stub. He was, so to\r\nspeak, on the roof of Whitefoot's house.\r\n\r\nNow in all the Green Forest there is no sound that strikes terror to\r\nthe hearts of the little people of feathers and fur equal to the hunting\r\ncall of Hooty the Owl. Hooty knows this. No one knows it better than he\r\ndoes. That is why he uses it. He knows that many of the little people\r\nare asleep, safely hidden away. He knows that it would be quite useless\r\nfor him to simply look for them. He would starve before he could find\r\na dinner in that way. But he knows that any one wakened from sleep\r\nin great fright is sure to move, and if they do this they are almost\r\nequally sure to make some little sound. His ears are so wonderful that\r\nthey can catch the faintest sound and tell exactly where it comes from.\r\nSo he uses that terrible hunting cry to frighten the little people and\r\nmake them move.\r\n\r\nNow Whitefoot knew that he was safe. Hooty couldn't possibly get at him,\r\neven should he find out that he was in there. There was nothing to fear,\r\nbut just the same, Whitefoot shivered and shook and jumped almost out of\r\nhis skin every time that Hooty hooted. He just couldn't help it.\r\n\r\n“He can't get me. I know he can't get me. I'm perfectly safe. I'm just\r\nas safe as if he were miles away. There's nothing to be afraid of. It is\r\nsilly to be afraid. Probably Hooty doesn't even know I am inside here.\r\nEven if he does, it doesn't really matter.” Whitefoot said these things\r\nto himself over and over again. Then Hooty would send out that fierce,\r\nterrible hunting call and Whitefoot would jump and shake just as before.\r\n\r\nAfter awhile all was still. Gradually Whitefoot stopped trembling. He\r\nguessed that Hooty had flown away. Still he remained right where he was\r\nfor a very long time. He didn't intend to foolishly take any chances. So\r\nhe waited and waited and waited.\r\n\r\nAt last he was sure that Hooty had left. Once more he climbed up to his\r\nlittle round doorway and there he waited some time before poking even\r\nhis nose outside. Then, just as he had made up his mind to go out, that\r\nterrible sound rang out again, and just as before he tumbled heels over\r\nhead down on his bed.\r\n\r\nWhitefoot didn't go out that night at all. It was a moonlight night and\r\njust the kind of a night to be out. Instead Whitefoot lay in his little\r\nbed and shivered and shook, for all through that long night every once\r\nin a while Hooty the Owl would hoot from the top of that stub.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV: Whitefoot The Wood Mouse Is Unhappy\r\n\r\n   Unhappiness without a cause you never, never find;\r\n   It may be in the stomach, or it may be in the mind.\r\n     --Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nWhitefoot the Wood Mouse should have been happy, but he wasn't. Winter\r\nhad gone and sweet Mistress Spring had brought joy to all the Green\r\nForest. Every one was happy, Whitefoot no less so than his neighbors at\r\nfirst. Up from the Sunny South came the feathered friends and at once\r\nbegan planning new homes. Twitterings and songs filled the air. Joy was\r\neverywhere. Food became plentiful, and Whitefoot became sleek and fat.\r\nThat is, he became as fat as a lively Wood Mouse ever does become. None\r\nof his enemies had discovered his new home, and he had little to worry\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nBut by and by Whitefoot began to feel less joyous. Day by day he grew\r\nmore and more unhappy. He no longer took pleasure in his fine home. He\r\nbegan to wander about for no particular reason. He wandered much farther\r\nfrom home than he had ever been in the habit of doing. At times he would\r\nsit and listen, but what he was listening for he didn't know. “There\r\nis something the matter with me, and I don't know what it is,” said\r\nWhitefoot to himself forlornly. “It can't be anything I have eaten. I\r\nhave nothing to worry about. Yet there is something wrong with me. I'm\r\nlosing my appetite. Nothing tastes good any more. I want something, but\r\nI don't know what it is I want.”\r\n\r\nHe tried to tell his troubles to his nearest neighbor, Timmy the Flying\r\nSquirrel, but Timmy was too busy to listen. When Peter Rabbit happened\r\nalong, Whitefoot tried to tell him. But Peter himself was too happy and\r\ntoo eager to learn all the news in the Green Forest to listen. No one\r\nhad any interest in Whitefoot's troubles. Every one was too busy with\r\nhis own affairs.\r\n\r\nSo day by day Whitefoot the Wood Mouse grew more and more unhappy, and\r\nwhen the dusk of early evening came creeping through the Green Forest,\r\nhe sat about and moped instead of running about and playing as he had\r\nbeen in the habit of doing. The beautiful song of Melody the Wood Thrush\r\nsomehow filled him with sadness instead of with the joy he had always\r\nfelt before. The very happiness of those about him seemed to make him\r\nmore unhappy.\r\n\r\nOnce he almost decided to go hunt for another home, but somehow he\r\ncouldn't get interested even in this. He did start out, but he had not\r\ngone far before he had forgotten all about what he had started for.\r\nAlways he had loved to run about and climb and jump for the pure\r\npleasure of it, but now he no longer did these things. He was unhappy,\r\nwas Whitefoot. Yes, sir, he was unhappy; and for no cause at all so far\r\nas he could see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV: Whitefoot Finds Out What The Matter Was\r\n\r\n   Pity the lonely, for deep in the heart\r\n   Is an ache that no doctor can heal by his art.\r\n    --Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nOf all the little people of the Green Forest Whitefoot seemed to be the\r\nonly one who was unhappy. And because he didn't know why he felt so he\r\nbecame day by day more unhappy. Perhaps I should say that night by night\r\nhe became more unhappy, for during the brightness of the day he slept\r\nmost of the time.\r\n\r\n“There is something wrong, something wrong,” he would say over and over\r\nto himself.\r\n\r\n“It must be with me, because everybody else is happy, and this is the\r\nhappiest time of all the year. I wish some one would tell me what ails\r\nme. I want to be happy, but somehow I just can't be.”\r\n\r\nOne evening he wandered a little farther from home than usual. He wasn't\r\ngoing anywhere in particular. He had nothing in particular to do. He was\r\njust wandering about because somehow he couldn't remain at home. Not far\r\naway Melody the Wood Thrush was pouring out his beautiful evening song.\r\nWhitefoot stopped to listen. Somehow it made him more unhappy than\r\never. Melody stopped singing for a few moments. It was just then that\r\nWhitefoot heard a faint sound. It was a gentle drumming. Whitefoot\r\npricked up his ears and listened. There it was again. He knew instantly\r\nhow that sound was made. It was made by dainty little feet beating very\r\nfast on an old log. Whitefoot had drummed that way himself many times.\r\nIt was soft, but clear, and it lasted only a moment.\r\n\r\nRight then something very strange happened to Whitefoot. Yes, sir,\r\nsomething very strange happened to Whitefoot. All in a flash he felt\r\nbetter. At first he didn't know why. He just did, that was all. Without\r\nthinking what he was doing, he began to drum himself. Then he listened.\r\nAt first he heard nothing. Then, soft and low, came that drumming sound\r\nagain. Whitefoot replied to it. All the time he kept feeling better. He\r\nran a little nearer to the place from which that drumming sound had come\r\nand then once more drummed. At first he got no reply.\r\n\r\nThen in a few minutes he heard it again, only this time it came from\r\na different place. Whitefoot became quite excited. He knew that that\r\ndrumming was done by another Wood Mouse, and all in a flash it came over\r\nhim what had been the matter with him.\r\n\r\n“I have been lonely!” exclaimed Whitefoot. “That is all that has been\r\nthe trouble with me. I have been lonely and didn't know it. I wonder if\r\nthat other Wood Mouse has felt the same way.”\r\n\r\nAgain he drummed and again came that soft reply. Once more Whitefoot\r\nhurried in the direction of it, and once more he was disappointed when\r\nthe next reply came from a different place. By now he was getting quite\r\nexcited. He was bound to find that other Wood Mouse. Every time he heard\r\nthat drumming, funny little thrills ran all over him. He didn't know\r\nwhy. They just did, that was all. He simply must find that other Wood\r\nMouse. He forgot everything else. He didn't even notice where he was\r\ngoing. He would drum, then wait for a reply. As soon as he heard it,\r\nhe would scamper in the direction of it, and then pause to drum again.\r\nSometimes the reply would be very near, then again it would be so far\r\naway that a great fear would fill Whitefoot's heart that the stranger\r\nwas running away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI: Love Fills The Heart Of Whitefoot\r\n\r\n   Joyous all the winds that blow\r\n   To the heart with love aglow.\r\n    --Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nIt was a wonderful game of hide-and-seek that Whitefoot the Wood Mouse\r\nwas playing in the dusk of early evening. Whitefoot was “it” all the\r\ntime. That is, he was the one who had to do all the hunting. Just who he\r\nwas hunting for he didn't know. He knew it was another Wood Mouse, but\r\nit was a stranger, and do what he would, he couldn't get so much as a\r\nglimpse of this little stranger. He would drum with his feet and after a\r\nslight pause there would be an answering drum. Then Whitefoot would run\r\nas fast as he could in that direction only to find no one at all. Then\r\nhe would drum again and the reply would come from another direction.\r\n\r\nEvery moment Whitefoot became more excited. He forgot everything, even\r\ndanger, in his desire to see that little drummer. Once or twice he\r\nactually lost his temper in his disappointment. But this was only for\r\na moment. He was too eager to find that little drummer to be angry very\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nAt last there came a time when there was no reply to his drumming. He\r\ndrummed and listened, then drummed again and listened. Nothing was to be\r\nheard. There was no reply. Whitefoot's heart sank.\r\n\r\nAll the old lonesomeness crept over him again. He didn't know which\r\nway to turn to look for that stranger. When he had drummed until he\r\nwas tired, he sat on the end of an old log, a perfect picture of\r\ndisappointment. He was so disappointed that he could have cried if it\r\nwould have done any good.\r\n\r\nJust as he had about made up his mind that there was nothing to do but\r\nto try to find his way home, his keen little ears caught the faintest\r\nrustle of dry leaves. Instantly Whitefoot was alert and watchful. Long\r\nago he had learned to be suspicious of rustling leaves. They might have\r\nbeen rustled by the feet of an enemy stealing up on him. No Wood Mouse\r\nwho wants to live long is ever heedless of rustling leaves. As still as\r\nif he couldn't move, Whitefoot sat staring at the place from which that\r\nfaint sound had seemed to come. For two or three minutes he heard\r\nand saw nothing. Then another leaf rustled a little bit to one side.\r\nWhitefoot turned like a flash, his feet gathered under him ready for a\r\nlong jump for safety.\r\n\r\nAt first he saw nothing. Then he became aware of two bright, soft little\r\neyes watching him. He stared at them very hard and then all over him\r\ncrept those funny thrills he had felt when he had first heard the\r\ndrumming of the stranger. He knew without being told that those eyes\r\nbelonged to the little drummer with whom he had been playing hide and\r\nseek so long.\r\n\r\nWhitefoot held his breath, he was so afraid that those eyes would\r\nvanish. Finally he rather timidly jumped down from the log and started\r\ntoward those two soft eyes. They vanished. Whitefoot's heart sank. He\r\nwas tempted to rush forward, but he didn't. He sat still. There was a\r\nslight rustle off to the right. A little ray of moonlight made its way\r\ndown through the branches of the trees just there, and in the middle of\r\nthe light spot it made sat a timid little person. It seemed to Whitefoot\r\nthat he was looking at the most beautiful Wood Mouse in all the Great\r\nWorld. Suddenly he felt very shy and timid himself.\r\n\r\n“Who--who--who are you?” he stammered.\r\n\r\n“I am little Miss Dainty,” replied the stranger bashfully.\r\n\r\nRight then and there Whitefoot's heart was filled so full of something\r\nthat it seemed as if it would burst. It was love. All in that instant he\r\nknew that he had found the most wonderful thing in all the Great World,\r\nwhich of course is love. He knew that he just couldn't live without\r\nlittle Miss Dainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII: Mr. And Mrs. Whitefoot\r\n\r\n   When all is said and all is done\r\n   'Tis only love of two makes one.\r\n    --Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nLittle Miss Dainty, the most beautiful and wonderful Wood Mouse in all\r\nthe Great World, according to Whitefoot, was very shy and very timid. It\r\ntook Whitefoot a long time to make her believe that he really couldn't\r\nlive without her. At least, she pretended not to believe it. If the\r\ntruth were known, little Miss Dainty felt just the same way about\r\nWhitefoot. But Whitefoot didn't know this, and I am afraid she teased\r\nhim a great deal before she told him that she loved him just as he loved\r\nher.\r\n\r\nBut at last little Miss Dainty shyly admitted that she loved Whitefoot\r\njust as much as he loved her and was willing to become Mrs. Whitefoot.\r\nSecretly she thought Whitefoot the most wonderful Wood Mouse in the\r\nGreat World, but she didn't tell him so. The truth is, she made him feel\r\nas if she were doing him a great favor.\r\n\r\nAs for Whitefoot, he was so happy that he actually tried to sing. Yes,\r\nsir, Whitefoot tried to sing, and he really did very well for a Mouse.\r\nHe was ready and eager to do anything that Mrs. Whitefoot wanted to do.\r\nTogether they scampered about in the moonlight, hunting for good things\r\nto eat, and poking their inquisitive little noses into every little\r\nplace they could find. Whitefoot forgot that he had ever been sad and\r\nlonely. He raced about and did all sorts of funny things from pure joy,\r\nbut he never once forgot to watch out for danger. In fact he was more\r\nwatchful than ever, for now he was watching for Mrs. Whitefoot as well\r\nas for himself.\r\n\r\nAt last Whitefoot rather timidly suggested that they should go see his\r\nfine home in a certain hollow stub. Mrs. Whitefoot insisted that they\r\nshould go to her home. Whitefoot agreed on condition that she\r\nwould afterwards visit his home. So together they went back to Mrs.\r\nWhitefoot's home. Whitefoot pretended that he liked it very much, but\r\nin his heart he thought his own home was very much better, and he felt\r\nquite sure that Mrs. Whitefoot would agree with him once she had seen\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Whitefoot was very well satisfied with her old home and not\r\nat all anxious to leave it. It was in an old hollow stump close to the\r\nground. It was just such a place as Shadow the Weasel would be sure to\r\nvisit should he happen along that way. It didn't seem at all safe to\r\nWhitefoot. In fact it worried him. Then, too, it was not in such a\r\npleasant place as was his own home. Of course he didn't say this, but\r\npretended to admire everything.\r\n\r\nTwo days and nights they spent there. Then Whitefoot suggested that they\r\nshould visit his home. “Of course, my dear, we will not have to live\r\nthere unless you want to, but I want you to see it,” said he.\r\n\r\nMrs. Whitefoot didn't appear at all anxious to go. She began to make\r\nexcuses for staying right where they were. You see, she had a great love\r\nfor that old home. They were sitting just outside the doorway talking\r\nabout the matter when Whitefoot caught a glimpse of a swiftly moving\r\nform not far off. It was Shadow the Weasel. Neither of them breathed.\r\nShadow passed without looking in their direction. When he was out of\r\nsight, Mrs. Whitefoot shivered.\r\n\r\n“Let's go over to your home right away,” she whispered. “I've never seen\r\nShadow about here before, but now that he has been here once, he may\r\ncome again.”\r\n\r\n“We'll start at once,” replied Whitefoot, and for once he was glad that\r\nShadow the Weasel was about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII: Mrs. Whitefoot Decides On A Home\r\n\r\n   When Mrs. Mouse makes up her mind\r\n   Then Mr. Mouse best get behind.\r\n    --Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nWhitefoot the Wood Mouse was very proud of his home. He showed it as he\r\nled Mrs. Whitefoot there. He felt sure that she would say at once that\r\nthat would be the place for them to live. You remember that it was high\r\nup in a tall, dead stub and had once been the home of Timmy the Flying\r\nSquirrel.\r\n\r\n“There, my dear, what do you think of that?” said Whitefoot proudly as\r\nthey reached the little round doorway.\r\n\r\nMrs. Whitefoot said nothing, but at once went inside. She was gone what\r\nseemed a long time to Whitefoot, anxiously waiting outside. You see,\r\nMrs. Whitefoot is a very thorough small person, and she was examining\r\nthe inside of that house from top to bottom. At last she appeared at the\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\n“Don't you think this is a splendid house?” asked Whitefoot rather\r\ntimidly.\r\n\r\n“It is very good of its kind,” replied Mrs. Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nWhitefoot's heart sank. He didn't like the tone in which Mrs. Whitefoot\r\nhad said that.\r\n\r\n“Just what do you mean, my dear?” Whitefoot asked.\r\n\r\n“I mean,” replied Mrs. Whitefoot, in a most decided way, “that it is a\r\nvery good house for winter, but it won't do at all for summer. That\r\nis, it won't do for me. In the first place it is so high up that if we\r\nshould have babies, I would worry all the time for fear the darlings\r\nwould have a bad fall. Besides, I don't like an inside house for summer.\r\nI think, Whitefoot, we must look around and find a new home.”\r\n\r\nAs she spoke Mrs. Whitefoot was already starting down the stub.\r\nWhitefoot followed.\r\n\r\n“All right, my dear, all right,” said he meekly. “You know best. This\r\nseems to me like a very fine home, but of course, if you don't like it\r\nwe'll look for another.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Whitefoot said nothing, but led the way down the tree with\r\nWhitefoot meekly following. Then began a patient search all about. Mrs.\r\nWhitefoot appeared to know just what she wanted and turned up her nose\r\nat several places Whitefoot thought would make fine homes. She hardly\r\nglanced at a fine hollow log Whitefoot found. She merely poked her nose\r\nin at a splendid hole beneath the roots of an old stump. Whitefoot\r\nbegan to grow tired from running about and climbing stumps and trees and\r\nbushes.\r\n\r\nHe stopped to rest and lost sight of Mrs. Whitefoot. A moment later he\r\nheard her calling excitedly. When he found her, she was up in a small\r\ntree, sitting on the edge of an old nest a few feet above the ground.\r\nIt was a nest that had once belonged to Melody the Wood Thrush. Mrs.\r\nWhitefoot was sitting on the edge of it, and her bright eyes snapped\r\nwith excitement and pleasure.\r\n\r\n“I've found it!” she cried. “I've found it! It is just what I have been\r\nlooking for.”\r\n\r\n“Found what?” Whitefoot asked. “I don't see anything but an old nest of\r\nMelody's.”\r\n\r\n“I've found the home we've been looking for, stupid,” retorted Mrs.\r\nWhitefoot.\r\n\r\nStill Whitefoot stared. “I don't see any house,” said he.\r\n\r\nMrs. Whitefoot stamped her feet impatiently. “Right here, stupid,” said\r\nshe. “This old nest will make us the finest and safest home that ever\r\nwas. No one will ever think of looking for us here. We must get busy at\r\nonce and fix it up.”\r\n\r\nEven then Whitefoot didn't understand. Always he had lived either in a\r\nhole in the ground, or in a hollow stump or tree. How they were to live\r\nin that old nest he couldn't see at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX: Making Over An Old House\r\n\r\n   A home is always what you make it.\r\n   With love there you will ne'er forsake it.\r\n    --Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nWhitefoot climbed up to the old nest of Melody the Wood Thrush over the\r\nedge of which little Mrs. Whitefoot was looking down at him. It took\r\nWhitefoot hardly a moment to get up there, for the nest was only a few\r\nfeet above the ground in a young tree, and you know Whitefoot is a very\r\ngood climber.\r\n\r\nHe found Mrs. Whitefoot very much excited. She was delighted with\r\nthat old nest and she showed it. For his part, Whitefoot couldn't see\r\nanything but a deserted old house of no use to any one. To be sure, it\r\nhad been a very good home in its time. It had been made of tiny twigs,\r\nstalks of old weeds, leaves, little fine roots and mud. It was still\r\nquite solid, and was firmly fixed in a crotch of the young tree. But\r\nWhitefoot couldn't see how it could be turned into a home for a Mouse.\r\nHe said as much.\r\n\r\nLittle Mrs. Whitefoot became more excited than ever. “You dear old\r\nstupid,” said she, “whatever is the matter with you? Don't you see that\r\nall we need do is to put a roof on, make an entrance on the under side,\r\nand make a soft comfortable bed inside to make it a delightful home?”\r\n\r\n“I don't see why we don't make a new home altogether,” protested\r\nWhitefoot. “It seems to me that hollow stub of mine is ever so much\r\nbetter than this. That has good solid walls, and we won't have to do a\r\nthing to it.”\r\n\r\n“I told you once before that it doesn't suit me for summer,” replied\r\nlittle Mrs. Whitefoot rather sharply, because she was beginning to lose\r\npatience. “It will be all right for winter, but winter is a long way\r\noff. It may suit you for summer, but it doesn't suit me, and this place\r\ndoes. So this is where we are going to live.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, my dear. Certainly,” replied Whitefoot very meekly. “If you\r\nwant to live here, here we will live. But I must confess it isn't clear\r\nto me yet how we are going to make a decent home out of this old nest.”\r\n\r\n“Don't you worry about that,” replied Mrs. Whitefoot. “You can get the\r\nmaterial, and I'll attend to the rest. Let us waste no time about it. I\r\nam anxious to get our home finished and to feel a little bit settled. I\r\nhave already planned just what has got to be done and how we will do it.\r\nNow you go look for some nice soft, dry weed stalks and strips of soft\r\nbark, and moss and any other soft, tough material that you can find.\r\nJust get busy and don't stop to talk.”\r\n\r\nOf course Whitefoot did as he was told. He ran down to the ground\r\nand began to hunt for the things Mrs. Whitefoot wanted. He was very\r\nparticular about it. He still didn't think much of her idea of making\r\nover that old home of Melody's, but if she would do it, he meant that\r\nshe should have the very best of materials to do it with.\r\n\r\nSo back and forth from the ground to the old nest in the tree Whitefoot\r\nhurried, and presently there was quite a pile of weed stalks and\r\nsoft grass and strips of bark in the old nest. Mrs. Whitefoot joined\r\nWhitefoot in hunting for just the right things, but she spent more time\r\nin arranging the material. Over that old nest she made a fine high roof.\r\nDown through the lower side she cut a little round doorway just big\r\nenough for them to pass through. Unless you happened to be underneath\r\nlooking up, you never would have guessed there was an entrance at all.\r\nInside was a snug, round room, and in this she made the softest and\r\nmost comfortable of beds. As it began to look more and more like a home,\r\nWhitefoot himself became as excited and eager as Mrs. Whitefoot had\r\nbeen from the beginning. “It certainly is going to be a fine home,” said\r\nWhitefoot.\r\n\r\n“Didn't I tell you it would be?” retorted Mrs. Whitefoot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX: The Whitefoots Enjoy Their New Home\r\n\r\n   No home is ever mean or poor\r\n   Where love awaits you at the door.\r\n    --Whitefoot.\r\n\r\n“There,” said Mrs. Whitefoot, as she worked a strip of white birch bark\r\ninto the roof of the new home she and Whitefoot had been building out of\r\nthe old home of Melody the Wood Thrush, “this finishes the roof. I don't\r\nthink any water will get through it even in the hardest rain.”\r\n\r\n“It is wonderful,” declared Whitefoot admiringly. “Wherever did you\r\nlearn to build such a house as this?”\r\n\r\n“From my mother,” replied Mrs. Whitefoot. “I was born in just such a\r\nhome. It makes the finest kind of a home for Wood Mouse babies.”\r\n\r\n“You don't think there is danger that the wind will blow it down, do\r\nyou?” ventured Whitefoot.\r\n\r\n“Of course I don't,” retorted little Mrs. Whitefoot scornfully. “Hasn't\r\nthis old nest remained right where it is for over a year? Do you suppose\r\nthat if I had thought there was the least bit of danger that it would\r\nblow down, I would have used it? Do credit me with a little sense, my\r\ndear.”\r\n\r\n“Yes'm, I do,” replied Whitefoot meekly. “You are the most sensible\r\nperson in all the Great World. I wasn't finding fault. You see, I have\r\nalways lived in a hole in the ground or a hollow stump, or a hole in\r\na tree, and I have not yet become used to a home that moves about and\r\nrocks as this one does when the wind blows. But if you say it is all\r\nright, why of course it is all right. Probably I will get used to it\r\nafter awhile.”\r\n\r\nWhitefoot did get used to it. After living in it for a few days, it no\r\nlonger seemed strange, and he no longer minded its swaying when the wind\r\nblew. The fact is, he rather enjoyed it. So Whitefoot and Mrs. Whitefoot\r\nsettled down to enjoy their new home. Now and then they added a bit to\r\nit here and there.\r\n\r\nSomehow Whitefoot felt unusually safe, safer than he had ever felt in\r\nany of his other homes. You see, he had seen several feathered folk\r\nalight close to it and not give it a second look. He knew that they\r\nhad seen that home, but had mistaken it for what it had once been, the\r\ndeserted home of one of their own number.\r\n\r\nWhitefoot had chuckled. He had chuckled long and heartily. “If they make\r\nthat mistake,” said he to himself, “everybody else is likely to make it.\r\nThat home of ours is right in plain sight, yet I do believe it is safer\r\nthan the best hidden home I ever had before. Shadow the Weasel never\r\nwill think of climbing up this little tree to look at an old nest, and\r\nShadow is the one I am most afraid of.”\r\n\r\nIt was only a day or two later that Buster Bear happened along that way.\r\nNow Buster is very fond of tender Wood Mouse. More than once Whitefoot\r\nhad had a narrow escape from Buster's big claws as they tore open an old\r\nstump or dug into the ground after him. He saw Buster glance up at the\r\nnew home without the slightest interest in those shrewd little eyes of\r\nhis. Then Buster shuffled on to roll over an old log and lick up the\r\nants he found under it. Again Whitefoot chuckled. “Yes, sir,” said he.\r\n“It is the safest home I 've ever had.”\r\n\r\nSo Whitefoot and little Mrs. Whitefoot were very happy in the home\r\nwhich they had built, and for once in his life Whitefoot did very little\r\nworrying. Life seemed more beautiful than it had ever been before. And\r\nhe almost forgot that there was such a thing as a hungry enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI: Whitefoot Is Hurt\r\n\r\n   The hurts that hardest are to bear\r\n   Come from those for whom we care.\r\n    --Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nWhitefoot was hurt. Yes, sir, Whitefoot was hurt. He was very much hurt.\r\nIt wasn't a bodily hurt; it was an inside hurt. It was a hurt that made\r\nhis heart ache. And to make it worse, he couldn't understand it at all.\r\nOne evening he had been met at the little round doorway by little Mrs.\r\nWhitefoot.\r\n\r\n“You can't come in,” said she.\r\n\r\n“Why can't I?” demanded Whitefoot, in the greatest surprise.\r\n\r\n“Never mind why. You can't, and that is all there is to it,” replied\r\nMrs. Whitefoot.\r\n\r\n“You mean I can't ever come in any more?” asked Whitefoot.\r\n\r\n“I don't know about that,” replied Mrs. Whitefoot, “but you can't come\r\nin now, nor for some time. I think the best thing you can do is to go\r\nback to your old home in the hollow stub.”\r\n\r\nWhitefoot stared at little Mrs. Whitefoot quite as if he thought she\r\nhad gone crazy. Then he lost his temper. “I guess I'll come in if I want\r\nto,” said he. “This home is quite as much my home as it is yours. You\r\nhave no right to keep me out of it. Just you get out of my way.”\r\n\r\nBut little Mrs. Whitefoot didn't get out of his way, and do what he\r\nwould, Whitefoot couldn't get in. You see she quite filled that little\r\nround doorway. Finally, he had to give up trying. Three times he came\r\nback and each time he found little Mrs. Whitefoot in the doorway. And\r\neach time she drove him away. Finally, for lack of any other place to\r\ngo to, he returned to his old home in the old stub. Once he had thought\r\nthis the finest home possible, but now somehow it didn't suit him at\r\nall. The truth is he missed little Mrs. Whitefoot, and so what had once\r\nbeen a home was now only a place in which to hide and sleep.\r\n\r\nWhitefoot's anger did not last long. It was replaced by that hurt\r\nfeeling. He felt that he must have done something little Mrs. Whitefoot\r\ndid not like, but though he thought and thought he couldn't remember a\r\nsingle thing. Several times he went back to see if Mrs. Whitefoot felt\r\nany differently, but found she didn't. Finally she told him rather\r\nsharply to go away and stay away. After that Whitefoot didn't venture\r\nover to the new home. He would sometimes sit a short distance away\r\nand gaze at it longingly. All the joy had gone out of the beautiful\r\nspringtime for him. He was quite as unhappy as he had been before he met\r\nlittle Mrs. Whitefoot. You see, he was even more lonely than he had been\r\nthen. And added to this loneliness was that hurt feeling, which made it\r\never and ever so much worse. It was very hard to bear.\r\n\r\n“If I could understand it, it wouldn't be so bad,” he kept saying\r\nover and over again to himself, “but I don't understand it. I don't\r\nunderstand why Mrs. Whitefoot doesn't love me any more.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII: The Surprise\r\n\r\n   Surprises sometimes are so great\r\n   You're tempted to believe in fate.\r\n    --Whitefoot.\r\n\r\nOne never-to-be forgotten evening Whitefoot met Mrs. Whitefoot and\r\nshe invited him to come back to their home. Of course Whitefoot was\r\ndelighted.\r\n\r\n“Sh-h-h,” said little Mrs. Whitefoot, as Whitefoot entered the snug\r\nlittle room of the house they had built in the old nest of Melody the\r\nWood Thrush. Whitefoot hesitated. In the first place, it was dark in\r\nthere. In the second place, he had the feeling that somehow that little\r\nbedroom seemed crowded. It hadn't been that way the last time he was\r\nthere. Mrs. Whitefoot was right in front of him, and she seemed very\r\nmuch excited about something.\r\n\r\nPresently she crowded to one side. “Come here and look,” said she.\r\n\r\nWhitefoot looked. In the middle of a soft bed of moss was a squirming\r\nmass of legs and funny little heads. At first that was all Whitefoot\r\ncould make out.\r\n\r\n“Don't you think this is the most wonderful surprise that ever was?”\r\n whispered little Mrs. Whitefoot. “Aren't they darlings? Aren't you proud\r\nof them?”\r\n\r\nBy this time Whitefoot had made out that that squirming mass of legs\r\nand heads was composed of baby Mice. He counted them. There were four.\r\n“Whose are they, and what are they doing here?” Whitefoot asked in a\r\nqueer voice.\r\n\r\n“Why, you old stupid, they are yours,--yours and mine,” declared little\r\nMrs. Whitefoot. “Did you ever, ever see such beautiful babies? Now I\r\nguess you understand why I kept you away from here.”\r\n\r\nWhitefoot shook his head. “No,” said he, “I don't understand at all. I\r\ndon't see yet what you drove me away for.”\r\n\r\n“Why, you blessed old dear, there wasn't room for you when those babies\r\ncame; I had to have all the room there was. It wouldn't have done to\r\nhave had you running in and out and disturbing them when they were so\r\ntiny. I had to be alone with them, and that is why I made you go off and\r\nlive by yourself. I am so proud of them, I don't know what to do. Aren't\r\nyou proud, Whitefoot? Aren't you the proudest Wood Mouse in all the\r\nGreen Forest?”\r\n\r\nOf course Whitefoot should have promptly said that he was, but the truth\r\nis, Whitefoot wasn't proud at all. You see, he was so surprised that\r\nhe hadn't yet had time to feel that they were really his. In fact, just\r\nthen he felt a wee bit jealous of them. It came over him that they would\r\ntake all the time and attention of little Mrs. Whitefoot. So Whitefoot\r\ndidn't answer that question. He simply sat and stared at those four\r\nsquirming babies.\r\n\r\nFinally little Mrs. Whitefoot gently pushed him out and followed him.\r\n“Of course,” said she, “there isn't room for you to stay here now. You\r\nwill have to sleep in your old home because there isn't room in here for\r\nboth of us and the babies too.”\r\n\r\nWhitefoot's heart sank. He had thought that he was to stay and that\r\neverything would be just as it had been before. “Can't I come over here\r\nany more?” he asked rather timidly.\r\n\r\n“What a foolish question!” cried little Mrs. Whitefoot. “Of course you\r\ncan. You will have to help take care of these babies. Just as soon as\r\nthey are big enough, you will have to help teach them how to hunt for\r\nfood and how to watch out for danger, and all the things that a wise\r\nWood Mouse knows. Why, they couldn't get along without you. Neither\r\ncould I,” she added softly.\r\n\r\nAt that Whitefoot felt better. And suddenly there was a queer swelling\r\nin his heart. It was the beginning of pride, pride in those wonderful\r\nbabies.\r\n\r\n“You have given me the best surprise that ever was, my dear,” said\r\nWhitefoot softly. “Now I think I will go and look for some supper.”\r\n\r\nSo now we will leave Whitefoot and his family. You see there are two\r\nvery lively little people of the Green Forest who demand attention and\r\ninsist on having it. They are Buster Bear's Twins, and this is to be the\r\ntitle of the next book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Whitefoot the Wood Mouse, by Thornton W. Burgess",
