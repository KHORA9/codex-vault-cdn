S. A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all lines of poultry keeping, duck raising is unique in that it lends\r\nitself to the greatest degree of specialization and intensification\r\nalong lines which are purely commercial. On a comparatively small area\r\nthousands of ducklings can be reared and marketed yearly. The call for\r\ninformation concerning the methods used by these commercial duck raisers\r\nhas been considerable, and since such information is not available in\r\ncomplete concise form the present book has been prepared partly to\r\nfurnish just this information.\r\n\r\nThe methods used by successful Long Island duck raisers differ widely in\r\nsome particulars and since in the space at command, it has been\r\nimpossible to describe all the methods used, the plan has been adopted\r\nof detailing in the main the methods of one successful grower. This it\r\nis believed will prove to be more helpful and less confusing than to\r\nattempt to give the method of several different men.\r\n\r\nMuch space has been given to the operations of the commercial duck\r\nraisers but the fact is recognized that the great bulk of the ducks\r\nentering into the trade of the country is the product of small flocks\r\nkept on general farms. For this reason a chapter has been added dealing\r\nwith duck raising on the farm, and attention is here called to the fact\r\nthat most of the information given under commercial duck raising can be\r\nreadily adapted to use in connection with the farm flock.\r\n\r\nDetailed, complete information on goose raising is even more fragmentary\r\nthan is the case with ducks. Yet there is a fine opportunity to rear a\r\nfew geese at a profit on many farms, and the need and call for\r\ninformation is quite general. It is for this reason that a section of\r\nthis book has been devoted to goose raising and in that section all the\r\ngood reliable information available on the subject is given. The special\r\nattention of the women of the farm is directed to the opportunity which\r\ngoose raising offers to make a good profit on a small side line with the\r\nminimum of initial investment and of labor.\r\n\r\nThe greatest care has been taken to make the information on both duck\r\nand goose raising as complete and clear as possible. However, the\r\nauthors appreciate the unlimited value of good illustrations in making\r\nclear methods and operations which are more difficult to grasp from a\r\nword description, and have therefore assembled a set of illustrations\r\nfor this book, the completeness and excellence of which have never\r\nbefore been approached in any book on the subject. The illustrations\r\nalone are an education.\r\n\r\nIn preparing and presenting this book to the public, the authors take\r\npleasure in acknowledging their deep indebtedness to the following\r\npersons for help and information furnished:\r\n\r\nRoy E. Pardee\r\nJohn C. Kriner\r\nCharles McClave\r\nStanley Mason\r\nDr. Balliet\r\nWilliam Minnich\r\nGeorge W. Hackett\r\nDawson Brothers\r\n\r\nParticular acknowledgment is due Robert A. Tuttle for the manner in\r\nwhich he threw open his duck plant to the authors and for the most\r\ngenerous amount of time which he gave in furnishing information.\r\n\r\nSpecial acknowledgment is likewise due Alfred R. Lee, Poultryman, U. S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, for information secured from his Farmers'\r\nBulletins on duck raising and goose raising.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface\r\n\r\nList of Illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I--DUCKS\r\n\r\nChapter.

According to the 1920 census\r\nthere were 2,817,624 ducks in the United States with a valuation of\r\n$3,373,966. As compared with this the census for 1910 shows a slightly\r\ngreater number of ducks, 2,906,525, but their value was considerably\r\nless being only $1,567,164. In the ten years between the census of 1900\r\nand that of 1910 there was a decrease in the number of ducks of nearly\r\n40%.\r\n\r\nAccording to the 1920 census the more important duck raising states\r\narranged in their order of importance were Iowa, Illinois, Pennsylvania,\r\nNew York, Missouri, Minnesota, Tennessee, Ohio, South Dakota, Indiana,\r\nNebraska and Kentucky. The number reported for Iowa was 235,249 and for\r\nKentucky 99,577. New England, the North Atlantic, the East North\r\nCentral, the West North Central, the Mountain and the Pacific states\r\nshowed an increase, while the South Atlantic, East South Central and\r\nWest South Central states showed a decrease. In spite of the existence\r\nof quite a number of large commercial duck farms, the great bulk of\r\nducks produced are those which come from the general farms where only\r\nsmall flocks are kept. Yet only a small proportion of farms have ducks\r\non them. The comparatively small number of ducks is distributed over\r\npractically the entire United States, being more common in some sections\r\nthan others, particularly along the Atlantic Coast and along the Pacific\r\nCoast, with fairly numerous flocks on the farms of the Middle West.\r\n\r\n_Different Types of Duck Raising._ The conditions under which ducks are\r\nkept and the purpose for which they are kept fall under four heads:\r\nFirst, commercial duck raising for the production of duck meat; second,\r\nduck raising as a by-product of the general farm; third, duck raising\r\nfor egg production; fourth, duck breeding for pleasure, exhibition or\r\nthe sale of breeding stock.\r\n\r\n_Opportunities for Duck Raising._ Undoubtedly the greatest opportunity\r\nfor profitable duck growing lies under the first of these heads, namely,\r\ncommercial duck raising. Where the conditions of climate, soil and land\r\nare favorable and where the location is good with respect to market\r\nthere exists an excellent opportunity for one skilled in duck growing to\r\nengage in that business in an intensive manner for the purpose of\r\nputting on the market spring or green ducklings. Where these are in\r\ndemand they bring a good price and since the output per farm is large\r\nthey pay a good return even with a small margin of profit per pound.\r\n\r\nThe second greatest opportunity undoubtedly consists of duck raising as\r\na by-product of the general farm. Where conditions are suitable, that is\r\nto say, where there is a considerable amount of pasture land easily\r\naccessible, and particularly where there is a stream or pond to which\r\nthe ducks can have access, a small flock of ducks, say 10 or 12 females,\r\ncan be kept to excellent advantage on the farm. The cost of maintaining\r\nthem will not be great and they will not only provide a most acceptable\r\nvariety in the form of duck meat and duck eggs for the farmers' table\r\nbut they will also produce a surplus which can be sold at a profit. It\r\nmust be remembered, however, that where only a small flock is kept it is\r\ngenerally impracticable for the farmer to give his ducks the attention\r\nnecessary to cater to the market for green ducklings. As a result he\r\nusually keeps them until fall and sells them on the market at a\r\nconsiderably lower price than is obtained by the commercial duck grower.\r\n\r\nThere also exists an opportunity which has not been developed to any\r\ngreat extent to keep some one of the egg producing breeds of ducks such\r\nas the Indian Runner for the primary purpose of egg production. A few\r\nventures of this sort seem to have been successful but it must be\r\nremembered that the market for duck eggs is not nearly so broad as that\r\nfor hens' eggs and that in some quarters there exists considerable\r\nprejudice against duck eggs for table consumption. Before engaging in\r\nduck raising primarily for the production of market eggs it would\r\ntherefore be necessary to investigate and consider carefully the market\r\nconditions in the neighborhood so as to know whether the eggs could be\r\nmarketed to advantage. While the Runner ducks are prolific layers there\r\nis no advantage in keeping them in preference to fowls as egg producers.\r\nThe eggs are larger in size but it takes more feed to produce them,\r\nwhile they cannot as a rule be disposed of at much if any higher price\r\nthan can be secured for hens' eggs. For baking purposes duck eggs can be\r\nreadily sold on account of their larger size.\r\n\r\nThere is always an opportunity to produce fine stock of any kind,\r\nwhether it be ducks, chickens, turkeys or geese. Ducks are not exhibited\r\nto the same extent as are chickens and the competition in the shows is\r\nnot as a rule so keen. Nevertheless many persons are interested in\r\nproducing and exhibiting good stock and there exists a very definite\r\nmarket for birds of quality.\r\n\r\nThere is also a probability that a good business could be worked up by\r\none who would pay special attention to producing a strain of ducks of\r\nearly maturity, large size and good vigor in order to supply breeding\r\ndrakes to many of the commercial duck farms. These farms usually secure\r\ndrakes for breeding from sources outside their own flocks each year but\r\nthe usual practice is to exchange drakes with some other commercial\r\ngrower. While very good birds are to be found on these duck farms there\r\nis no greater opportunity to engage in any systematic breeding, the\r\nselection of the breeding stock being of rather a hurried nature during\r\ncertain seasons of the year when the ducks are being marketed. Moreover,\r\nthe long continued custom of exchanging drakes with the neighboring\r\nfarmers has in most cases led to the blood being so largely confined\r\nwithin one circle that no great percentage of new blood is obtained by\r\nthese exchanges. Of course, the opportunity along breeding lines for\r\nthis purpose is limited to the Pekin duck as this is the breed which is\r\nkept upon all the large commercial duck farms in the United States.\r\n\r\n_Prices for Breeding Stock._ Duck breeders who make a specialty of\r\nselling breeding stock or eggs for hatching find a steady and quite a\r\nwide demand for their stock. The eggs are usually sold in sittings of 11\r\nand bring a price of from $3 to $5 per sitting depending on the quality\r\nof the stock. The prices received for the birds themselves depend of\r\ncourse upon their quality and may run anywhere from about $5 to $25 per\r\nbird.\r\n\r\n_Ducks for Ornamental Purposes._ On estates or in parks where natural or\r\nartificial ponds are included in the grounds, waterfowl are often kept\r\nfor ornamental purposes. Any breeds may be used, and often the gay\r\ncolored Wood Duck and Mandarin, or some one of the small breeds such as\r\nthe Calls, Black East Indian or the Mallards are kept for this purpose.\r\nIt is said that these small ducks will absolutely destroy the mosquito\r\nlarvae in any such ponds or lakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nBreeds and Varieties--How to Mate to Produce Exhibition\r\nSpecimens--Preparing Ducks for the Show--Catching and Handling\r\n\r\n\r\n_Breeds of Ducks._ There are 11 standard breeds of ducks. All of these\r\nbreeds with the exception of the Call, Muscovy and Runner consist of a\r\nsingle variety. The Call is divided into two varieties, the Gray and the\r\nWhite; the Muscovy consists of two varieties, the Colored and the White;\r\nand the Runner consists of three varieties, the Fawn and White, the\r\nWhite and the Penciled.\r\n\r\nDuck breeders, of course, whether raising the birds for fancy or for\r\nprofit, keep one of the standard breads or varieties. Frequently, also,\r\nthe farm flocks consist of standardbred ducks but on many farms,\r\nprobably a great majority, the flock consists of the common or so-called\r\n\"puddle\" duck. In certain parts of the South there is a duck known as\r\nthe \"mule duck\" which is a cross between the Muscovy and the common\r\nduck. This is a duck of good market quality but will not breed from\r\nwhich characteristic it gets its name. Most of the common or \"puddle\"\r\nducks which are found on farms are of rather small size, are indifferent\r\nas layers, and do not make a desirable type of market duck. They have\r\narisen simply from the crossing of standard breeds with resultant\r\ncarelessness and indifference in breeding. Because of the care with\r\nwhich they have been selected and bred for definite purposes, the\r\nstandard breeds are decidedly superior to the common \"puddle\" ducks and\r\nshould by all means be kept in preference since they will yield better\r\nresults and greater profits.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the standard breeds and varieties flocks of Mallards are\r\nalso kept to a limited extent. The Mallard is a common small wild duck\r\nwhich has lent itself readily to domestication and which thrives with\r\nproper care under confined conditions. In weight, the drakes will run\r\nfrom 2-1/2 pounds to 3 pounds or even a little larger. The ducks average\r\nabout 21/4 pounds with a variation of from 1 pound 12 ounces to 2 pounds 8\r\nounces. By selecting the large eggs for hatching and by liberal feeding,\r\nit is easy to increase the size of Mallards to such an extent that they\r\nresemble small Rouens rather than wild Mallards. The plumage of the\r\nMallard is very similar to that of the Rouen but of a lighter shade.\r\nAnother small wild duck known as the Wood or Carolina duck, which is a\r\nnative of North America, has been domesticated and on account of the\r\ngreat beauty of its plumage is usually to be found wherever ornamental\r\nwaterfowl are kept. The Mandarin duck is a small duck of about the same\r\nsize as the Wood duck, is of beautiful plumage and like the Wood duck\r\nis generally kept for ornamental purposes. This duck is said to be a\r\nnative of China.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. Upper--Pair of Mule Ducks. Lower--Pair of Blue\r\nSwedish Ducks. (_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. Upper--Mallard Duck. Lower--Mallard Drake. The\r\nMallard is a wild duck which is quite easily domesticated and which has\r\na plumage color very similar to the Rouen. It is small in size.\r\n(_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture._)]\r\n\r\nClassification of Breeds\r\n\r\nSo far as the standard breeds and varieties are concerned they may be\r\ndivided into three classes according to the purpose for which they are\r\nkept and for which they are best suited. First is the meat class which\r\nconsists of the Pekin, Aylesbury, Muscovy, Rouen, Buff, Cayuga and Blue\r\nSwedish. These breeds could well be termed general purpose ducks for\r\nthey are quite good layers in addition to producing excellent table\r\ncarcasses and are therefore well suited for general farm use. They are,\r\nhowever, kept more particularly for meat production.\r\n\r\nThe second class is known as the egg class and consists of the three\r\nvarieties of the Runner Duck, formerly known as the Indian Runner. The\r\nRunner Duck is much smaller in size than the birds of the meat class, is\r\nlonger in leg and more active, and is not so well suited for the\r\nproduction of table ducks but is a very prolific layer. With proper\r\nfeeding and management the Runner ducks will compare favorably with hens\r\nas egg producers.\r\n\r\nThe third class is known as the ornamental class and is composed of the\r\nducks which are kept and bred principally for ornamental purposes. This\r\nclass consists of the Call duck with its two varieties, the Black East\r\nIndia duck and the Crested White duck. Both the Call and East India\r\nducks are small in size being really the bantams of the duck family.\r\nWhile they make good table birds, their small size handicaps them as\r\ncommercial meat fowl. The Crested White duck is of larger size,\r\npossesses a crest and is bred mainly as an ornamental fowl.\r\n\r\n_Marking the Ducks._ The duck raiser who is breeding his ducks for\r\nexhibition quality has need for knowledge of the breeding of the birds\r\nhe may contemplate using in his matings. In order that this information\r\nmay be available, the young ducks as they are hatched can be marked by\r\ntoe punching them on the webs of their feet in the same manner that baby\r\nchicks are toe punched. A different set or combination of marks is used\r\nfor each mating so that the breeding of the different ducks can be\r\ndistinguished. Mature ducks can, if desired, be leg banded in order to\r\nfurnish a distinguishing mark.\r\n\r\n\r\nNomenclature\r\n\r\nBefore taking up a description of the matings of the different standard\r\nbreeds and varieties it is well to indicate the common nomenclature\r\nwhich is used in connection with these fowls and which differs from that\r\nused for chickens. The male duck is called drake, the female duck is\r\ntermed duck, and the young duck of either sex is termed duckling. In\r\ngiving the standard weights for the different breeds of ducks, weights\r\nare given for adult ducks and adult drakes, and for young ducks and\r\nyoung drakes. By adult duck or drake is meant a bird which is over one\r\nyear old. By young duck or drake is meant a bird which is less than one\r\nyear old. The horny mouth parts of the duck instead of being termed beak\r\nas in chickens are called bill, and the separate division of the upper\r\nbill at its extremity is termed the bean. Ducks do not show any comb or\r\nwattles as in chickens. In England use is made of the terms ducklet and\r\ndrakerel. Ducklet is used to signify a female during her first laying\r\nseason just as the word pullet is used in contrast to hen. Drakerel is\r\nused to signify a young drake as contrasted with an older drake just as\r\nthe word cockerel is used in comparison to cock in chickens.\r\n\r\n_Distinguishing the Sex._ The sex of mature ducks can be readily told by\r\ntheir voices and also by a difference in the feathering. The duck gives\r\nvoice to a coarse, harsh sound which is the characteristic \"quack\"\r\nusually thought of in connection with this class of fowl. The drake on\r\nthe other hand utters a cry which is not nearly so loud or harsh but\r\nwhich is more of a hissing sound. Distinction of sex by this means can\r\nbe made after the ducklings are from 4 to 6 weeks old. Before this age,\r\nboth sexes make the same peeping noise.\r\n\r\nMature drakes are also distinguished from the ducks by the presence of\r\ntwo sex feathers at the base of the tail. These are short feathers\r\nwhich curl or curve upward and forward toward the body of the bird. In\r\nducks these feathers are absent.\r\n\r\n\r\nSize\r\n\r\nAn idea of the size of the different standard breeds can best be\r\nobtained by giving the standard weights. They are as follows:--\r\n\r\n              Adult Drake.  Adult Duck.  Young Drake.  Young Duck.\r\nPekin              9             8            8             7\r\nAylesbury          9             8            8             7\r\nRouen              9             8            8             7\r\nCayuga             8             7            7             6\r\nMuscovy           10             7            8             6\r\nBlue Swedish       8             7            6-1/2         5-1/2\r\nCrested White      7             6            6             5\r\nBuff               8             7            7             6\r\nRunner             4-1/2         4            4             3-1/2\r\n\r\nThere are no standard weights for the Call duck and for the Black East\r\nIndia duck but these are all small in size, being really bantam ducks.\r\nThe drakes will weigh from 2-1/2 to 3 pounds and the ducks from 2 to 2-1/2\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nPopularity of Breeds\r\n\r\nIn the meat class by far the most popular duck in this country is the\r\nPekin. It is the breed which is used exclusively on the large\r\ncommercial duck farms. Next to the Pekin in this class probably comes\r\nthe Muscovy which is quite commonly kept in some sections of the\r\ncountry, particularly in the South. The Aylesbury duck has never proved\r\nto be very popular in the United States perhaps due to its white bill\r\nand skin, although it is the popular market duck of England. The other\r\nbreeds included in the meat class are kept more or less commonly but do\r\nnot approach in popularity either the Pekin or the Muscovy. Any of the\r\nbreeds in this class will prove to be satisfactory for a farm flock,\r\nalthough the Colored breeds and varieties are at a disadvantage when\r\ndressed due to their dark pin feathers.\r\n\r\nIn the _egg_ class there is included only the Indian Runner and this of\r\ncourse is the breed which is kept wherever the production of duck eggs\r\nis the primary object. The Fawn and White is the most popular variety of\r\nthis breed.\r\n\r\nIn the ornamental class there is no particular outstanding breed, since\r\nthe ducks belonging in this class are kept very largely to satisfy the\r\npleasure of the owner and the selection of a breed is entirely a matter\r\nof personal preference.\r\n\r\n\r\nEgg Production\r\n\r\nWhile the conditions under which ducks are kept and the care they are\r\ngiven will affect their egg production greatly, there are certain\r\nrather definite comparisons that can be made between the different\r\nbreeds. The Pekin is a good layer and will produce from 80 to 120 eggs.\r\nThe Aylesbury and the Rouen are about alike in laying ability, neither\r\nbeing quite as good as the Pekin. The Cayuga is a good layer ranking\r\nwith the Aylesbury and Rouen or between these and the Pekin. The Muscovy\r\nis an excellent layer being fully as prolific as the Pekin, especially\r\nif broken up when broody and not allowed to sit. The Blue Swedish is\r\nabout equal to the Cayuga in laying ability. The Buff duck is an\r\nexcellent layer comparing favorably with the Pekin or even with the\r\nRunner. The Runner ducks are the best layers of the duck family and if\r\ngiven proper care and good feed will compare favorably with hens in egg\r\nproducing ability. The Crested White duck is not a particularly good\r\nlayer. The Calls and the Black East India ducks will lay from 20 to 60\r\neggs per year, approaching the latter number if the eggs are collected\r\nas laid and the ducks are not allowed to sit which will induce some of\r\nthem to continue to lay for quite a portion of the year. Extremely large\r\nducks of any breed do not lay as well as the more medium sized birds.\r\n\r\n_Size of Duck Eggs._ The eggs of the different meat breeds will run\r\nabout the same in size with the exception of the Muscovy whose eggs run\r\na little larger. Actual weights of eggs from representative flocks show\r\nPekin, Rouen, Aylesbury and Cayuga eggs to average about 2-1/2 pounds per\r\ndozen although there is a tendency for the Rouen eggs to run somewhat\r\nlarger and for Cayugas to run a little smaller. Muscovy eggs weigh about\r\n3 pounds per dozen with selected large eggs weighing as high as 3-1/4\r\npounds. Eggs of the Runner duck are smaller but are considerably larger\r\nthan average hens' eggs or about the size of large Minorca eggs. They\r\nweigh about 2 pounds per dozen. Eggs of the bantam breeds of ducks, the\r\nCalls and the Black East India, together with those of the Mandarin and\r\nWood ducks will weigh from one pound to 1-1/2 pounds per dozen depending\r\nupon the size of the ducks themselves. Eggs of the Mallard duck will run\r\nfrom 26 to 32 ounces to the dozen. The size of eggs laid by ducks,\r\nespecially the bantam breeds and the Mallard can be increased somewhat\r\nby liberal feeding. Average hens' eggs should weigh about 1-1/2 pounds per\r\ndozen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. Upper--Comparison of size of goose egg on the\r\nleft a black egg of a Cayuga duck in the center and a hen egg on the\r\nright. Lower--Duck eggs--At the left is a Pekin duck egg, next a black\r\negg laid by a Cayuga duck, third a Muscovy egg, fourth a duck egg of\r\ngreen color and on the extreme right the egg of a Runner duck.\r\n(_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_Color of Eggs._ The color of duck eggs ranges from white to a polished\r\nblack. Pekin eggs run mostly white although some show a decided blue or\r\ngreen tint. Aylesbury eggs run quite uniformly white. The color of Rouen\r\neggs varies from white to a dark green. The Cayuga produces very few\r\nwhite eggs, most of them being green or black, some being as black as\r\nthough polished. Muscovy eggs run from a white to a greenish cream in\r\ncolor. The eggs of the Blue Swedish and the Buff ducks usually run\r\nwhite. The Runner duck lays white eggs as a rule while the Crested White\r\nduck lays eggs which range in color from white to green. The eggs of\r\nthe Call ducks run from white to green while the eggs of the Black East\r\nIndia, like the Cayuga, for the most part run from green to black.\r\n\r\nA peculiarity in regard to the egg color is that the same female may lay\r\neggs which are widely different in color. It is likewise true that the\r\ncolor of the shell is influenced to some extent by the feed. Ducks on\r\nrange will lay darker colored eggs than those which are yarded. There is\r\nalso a tendency for the eggs to run darker in color when laying first\r\nbegins and for the eggs to lighten as laying proceeds. A peculiarity in\r\nregard to duck eggs with a dark colored shell is that a thorough washing\r\nwill lighten up the shell color decidedly.\r\n\r\n_Broodiness._ The Muscovy, the Call and the Black East India ducks are\r\nbroody breeds. The ducks of these breeds will make their nests, hatch\r\ntheir eggs and are good mothers. All the other breeds are classed as\r\nnon-broody breeds. Of course, a certain percentage of them will go\r\nbroody and show a desire to sit but they do not make reliable sitters\r\nand mothers and are not as a rule used for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsiderations in Making the Mating[1]\r\n\r\nSince ducks are kept for different purposes there will of course be\r\ncertain fundamental differences in the different classes in the\r\nselection of the individuals to make up the mating. Whatever the\r\npurpose, however, the first consideration in selecting the breeders must\r\nbe to secure those which possess excellent vigor and general health and\r\nwhich meet insofar as possible the standard requirements for size. Where\r\nthe Call duck and the Black East India are concerned the selection for\r\nsize must be for smallness since that is a characteristic greatly\r\ndesired. In the other breeds the selection for size must be to see that\r\nthey come up to the standard weights for the particular breed in\r\nquestion. As in other classes of fowls the condition and cleanliness of\r\nthe plumage and the general appearance and actions of the birds are good\r\nindications of their health and thriftiness. A bright eye is likewise a\r\nvaluable indication of good health while a watery eye is usually a sign\r\nof weakness. It is necessary to guard against birds which show any\r\ntendency toward crooked or roach back, hump back, crooked tails, or\r\ntwisted wings. Since all breeds of ducks should have clean or\r\nunfeathered legs it is likewise necessary to guard against any breeders\r\nwhich show down on the shanks or between the toes as this sometimes\r\noccurs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For a more detailed discussion of the principles of\r\nbreeding as applied to chickens and which is equally applicable to\r\nducks, the reader is referred to \"The Mating and Breeding of Poultry\" by\r\nHarry M. Lamon and Rob R. Slocum, published by the Orange Judd\r\nPublishing Company, New York City.]\r\n\r\nIn selecting the mating for any one of the meat breeds use birds which\r\nhave good length, width and depth of body so that they will have plenty\r\nof meat carrying capacity. For breeders of market ducks, birds which\r\nare active, well matured and which are not extreme in size for the breed\r\nare preferable as the fertility is likely to run better than with the\r\nextremely large birds. Where birds are bred for exhibition purposes, it\r\nfrequently happens that it is desirable to use large breeders and to\r\nhold them for breeding purposes as long as they are in good breeding\r\ncondition. Where this is the case it becomes necessary to mate a smaller\r\nnumber of females to a drake than would be the case with smaller and\r\nyounger breeders. Where old birds are used as breeders better results\r\nwill be secured by mating old ducks to a young drake or vice versa than\r\nby mating together old birds of both sexes. While ducks of any of the\r\nmeat breeds are kept primarily for meat production, it is essential that\r\nthe egg production be good throughout the breeding season in order to\r\nraise as many ducklings and secure as great a profit as possible.\r\nSelection of the females as breeders should be made therefore on the\r\nbasis of good egg production as well as good meat type if the conditions\r\nunder which the ducks are kept are such as to make it possible to check\r\nthis in any manner.\r\n\r\nIn selecting the mating in the Runner breed it is necessary to keep in\r\nmind that the general type of body is quite different from that of the\r\nmeat breeds, being much slimmer and much more upright in body carriage.\r\nFor this mating select thrifty, healthy birds and those which are\r\nactive. Some breeders trapnest their Runner ducks or have some other\r\nmeans of checking up the better layers. As in chickens, it is of course\r\ndesirable to use these better layers as breeders since the purpose in\r\nkeeping this kind of duck is primarily egg production.\r\n\r\nIn selecting the mating in the Call and East India breeds it is\r\nnecessary to use the smaller ducks since the object here is to keep the\r\nsize small. In addition, with these breeds or with any other breeds kept\r\nand bred primarily for fancy or exhibition purposes, it is necessary to\r\nconform just as closely as possible to the standard requirements[2] both\r\ninsofar as size and type are concerned, and also with respect to color.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: For a complete and official description and list of\r\ndisqualifications of the standard breeds and varieties of ducks, the\r\nreader is referred to the American Standard of Perfection published by\r\nthe American Poultry Association, and obtained by Orange Judd Publishing\r\nCompany, New York, N. Y.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBreeds of Ducks\r\n\r\n_The Pekin._ While this variety wants to be of good size and to have\r\nlength, breadth and depth of body it is somewhat more upstanding than\r\nsome of the other meat breeds, showing a definite slope of body downward\r\nfrom shoulders to tail. The back line of the Pekin should show a slight\r\nconcavity from the shoulders to the tail and the upper line of the bill\r\nis likewise slightly concave between the point where it joins the head\r\nand its extremity. The shoulders should be broad and any tendency\r\ntoward narrowness at this point must be avoided. While a good depth of\r\nkeel is desired, the standard does not call for so deep a keel as in the\r\nAylesbury. As a matter of fact, however, the winning specimens as seen\r\nin the shows are not as a rule as erect in carriage as called for by the\r\nstandard illustration, there being a tendency to get them almost if not\r\nquite as deep in keel as the Aylesbury. In fact, some breeders seem to\r\nstrive for a low down keel approaching a condition where they are nearly\r\nas low in front as behind but this is not desirable Pekin type.\r\n\r\nSometimes a drake will show a rough neck, that is, the feathers on the\r\nback of the neck will be crossed or folded over showing a tendency to\r\ncurl. These birds should be avoided as breeders since there is a\r\ntendency for them to produce ducks having a crest. Sometimes a green or\r\na greenish spotted bill will be encountered. Since the bill should be a\r\nclear yellow, breeders showing this defect should be avoided\r\nparticularly as they are likely to produce birds having greenish or\r\nolive colored legs. The shanks and toes should be a clear deep orange.\r\nBlack sometimes occurs in the bean. This may occur in birds of either\r\nsex but is more common in the ducks than in the drakes. In the drake\r\nblack in the bean disqualifies but while it is undesirable and a serious\r\ndefect in the duck it does not disqualify. The color of the plumage is\r\nwhite or creamy white throughout. Creaminess in this variety is not a\r\nserious defect as it is in white chickens. The use, however, of yellow\r\ncorn and of foods very rich in oil tends to increase the creaminess of\r\nthe plumage and should not be used to excess for birds which are to be\r\nexhibited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. Upper--Young Pekins which on account of their\r\nsize, thriftiness and rapid growth were selected out of a lot about to\r\nbe killed for market and saved for breeders. Lower--Aylesbury\r\nDrake--Notice the depth and development of the breast. (_Photographs\r\nfrom the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_The Aylesbury._ This breed is particularly noted for its deep keel. It\r\ndiffers from the Pekin in type in that it is more nearly level in body.\r\nThere is a decided tendency for the Aylesbury to run too short in body\r\nwhich has probably come about by extreme selection for deep keel. It is\r\nwell, therefore, in making the mating to select breeders with good\r\nlength of body. Since the deep full breast and keel is characteristic of\r\nthis breed it is necessary to avoid breeders which show any tendency\r\ntoward a flat breast. As in the case of the Pekins avoid any birds which\r\nhave green or olive colored bills. The back line of the Aylesbury should\r\nbe straight, showing no tendency toward a slight concavity as in the\r\nPekin. Birds showing this shape back should be avoided. As in the Pekin\r\nblack on the bill or bean of the drake will disqualify and in the duck\r\nis a serious defect. The color of plumage should be white throughout and\r\nshould show no tendency toward creaminess. The bill in this breed is\r\nflesh colored instead of yellow as in the Pekin. The Aylesbury is not\r\nquite as nervous a breed as the Pekin.\r\n\r\n_The Rouen._ The Rouen duck is a parti-colored breed and is therefore\r\nmuch more difficult to secure in perfection of color and marking than\r\nis the case with the white breeds. Moreover, the dark pin feathers make\r\nthe ducks more difficult to dress than in white breeds. In type these\r\nbirds are very level in body and are massive, carrying a great deal of\r\nmeat. Avoid birds showing a lack of length of body or depth of keel or\r\nwhich are too flat in breast. The back of the Rouen should have a\r\nslightly convex or arched shape from neck to tail and it is necessary to\r\nguard against birds which have a flat or a concave back. The body of the\r\nRouen should be carried practically horizontal. The upper line of the\r\nbill should be slightly dished or concave. The white ring about the neck\r\nof the drake is an important part of the marking. This should not be too\r\nwide but should run about a quarter of an inch in width. It should be as\r\ndistinct and clean cut as possible but should not quite come together in\r\nthe rear. Any approach to a ring in the female is a disqualification.\r\nWhite in the primary or secondary wing feathers is a serious defect\r\nsince it constitutes a disqualification. It must therefore be carefully\r\navoided. White feathers in the fluff of the drake is another color\r\ndefect which must be guarded against.\r\n\r\n_Breast of Drake._ The farther the claret color on the breast of the\r\ndrake extends down the better will be the females secured from the\r\nmating. Drakes which are deficient in the amount of claret on the breast\r\nshould therefore be thrown out as breeders. A purple rump in drakes must\r\nbe avoided as must black feathers over the rump as they tend to keep\r\nup too dark a body color in the female. On the other hand too bright or\r\nlight a color in the male or exhibition female will produce females\r\nwhich are too light in color. Drakes with light olive colored bills must\r\nbe avoided as these will have a tendency to produce offspring which show\r\ntoo much yellow in the females' bills, and clear yellow bills constitute\r\na disqualification. In the females solid yellow bills, fawn colored\r\nbreasts and absence of penciling must be avoided. Females which are dark\r\nor nearly black over the rump are good breeders as they tend to keep up\r\nthe ground color of the body and tail.\r\n\r\nThe Rouen shows some tendency to fade in color. This is evidenced first\r\non the tips of the wings. The fading will also show in the fluff of\r\ndrakes. The drakes of this breed and likewise of the Gray Call and the\r\nMallard show a peculiar behavior with respect to the color of their\r\nplumage. About June 1 the drakes moult, losing their characteristic male\r\nadult plumage and the new plumage is practically that of the female.\r\nThis female plumage is retained until about October when they gradually\r\nregain their normal winter male plumage. Young Rouens of both sexes have\r\nfemale plumage until the last moult which occurs at about four or five\r\nmonths of age, when the drakes assume the adult male plumage. The sex of\r\nthe young Rouens can, however, be told by the difference in the color of\r\nthe bills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. Upper--Rouen Drake. Notice the low set, nearly\r\nhorizontal body, the massive appearance and the arched back. Lower--Pair\r\nof Black East India Ducks. (_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. Upper--Rouen Drake showing summer plumage. At\r\nthis season the Rouen drake assumes a plumage resembling quite closely\r\nthat of the female. In the fall the drake again assumes the normal male\r\nplumage. Lower--Rouen Duck. (_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_The Cayuga._ The Cayuga is much like the other breeds of the meat\r\nclass in general type or shape of body showing good length, breadth and\r\ndepth. It is a very solid duck and weighs heavier than it looks. The\r\nbody carriage is slightly more upright than the Rouen but not so much so\r\nas the Pekin. The back line should be straight and any tendency toward\r\nan arched back must be avoided. It is slightly smaller than the Pekin,\r\nAylesbury and Rouen, averaging about a pound less.\r\n\r\nIn making the mating, size is important and breeders should be selected\r\nwhich are up to standard weights if possible. While this breed is not\r\nkept very widely at the present time, nevertheless it is an excellent\r\nmarket duck, dressing out into a very plump yellow carcass in spite of\r\nits black plumage which is a disadvantage in dressing. The color should\r\nbe a lustrous greenish black throughout, being somewhat brighter in the\r\ndrake than in the duck. The duck is more likely to show a brownish cast\r\nof plumage, particularly as she grows older. It is hard to hold good\r\nblack color with age. Moreover, white or gray is apt to occur in the\r\nbreast of females. With age also a little white sometimes develops on\r\nthe back of the neck, around the eyes and underneath the neck at the\r\nbase of the bill. The white which occurs in breast is more likely to\r\ncome in ducks and is not commonly found in the drakes. In the drakes on\r\nthe other hand, there is a tendency for the white to come on the throat\r\nunder the bill.\r\n\r\nDrakes as a rule run truer in color and hold their color better than\r\ndo the ducks. Where the white mottling occurs in plumage with age one\r\nneed not hesitate to breed from these birds if they were of good black\r\ncolor as young birds. The drakes of the best color do not as a rule fade\r\nor become mottled to any great extent with age. It is necessary to guard\r\nagainst birds as breeders which have a rusty brown lacing on the breast\r\nand under the wings, also those which have a wing-bow laced with brown.\r\nThere is a tendency for the bill of drakes, which should be black, to be\r\ntoo light or olive in color and this tendency increases with age. Drakes\r\nwith bills of this color should be avoided as breeders. When Cayugas are\r\nfirst hatched the baby ducks all show a white breast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. Upper--Cayuga Duck. Lower--Cayuga Drake.\r\n(_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_The Call._ The Call ducks are the bantams of the duck race. There is\r\nalways a tendency for them to grow too large and this is especially true\r\nwhen they have an opportunity to eat all they want as for example when\r\nthey are fed with the larger ducks. They should not be fed too liberally\r\nand should be given wheat or some other solid grain rather than any\r\nmash. If there is a good pond of water to which the Call ducks can have\r\naccess they do not need to be fed much of anything.\r\n\r\nIn breeding, the smallest individuals which are suitable in other\r\nrespects for breeders, should be selected in order to keep down the size\r\nand offset the tendency to breed larger in successive generations. In\r\ntype the Calls are practically miniature Pekins except that they should\r\nhave a very short, rather broad head and bill. The broad flat and short\r\nbill and the round short head give the head an appearance which is often\r\ndescribed by the term \"button headed\". In this breed avoid birds which\r\nshow arched backs. The body should have what is known as a flatiron\r\nshape, that is, should be broad at the shoulders and taper toward the\r\ntail. Too deep keels and narrow shoulders should be avoided as should\r\nalso too long bills. Call ducks, together with East Indias and Mallards\r\nshould have their wings clipped or be pinioned, that is, have the first\r\njoint of one wing cut off, to prevent them from flying away.\r\n\r\n_The Gray Call._ The plumage of the Gray Call is practically that of the\r\nRouen although they are not quite as good in color as a breed. There is\r\nmore of a tendency for some of the birds to run to dark and others,\r\nespecially the males, to run too light in color. While they are likely\r\nto be well penciled the shade of color is apt to be wrong. White in the\r\nflights and under the wings must be guarded against as must also absence\r\nof ribbon or wing bar in females. The color of the plumage is likely to\r\nfade with age but after the birds moult and secure their new plumage,\r\nthe color is usually higher again. In general the same color\r\ncharacteristics hold true as with the Rouen and the same defects must be\r\nguarded against.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. Upper--Gray Call Drake. Lower--Gray Call Duck.\r\n(_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture_.)]\r\n\r\n_The White Call._ This variety is, both in type and color, practically a\r\nminiature Pekin except for the short, rather broad head and bill.\r\nThey breed very true in color and should be free from creaminess. The\r\nsame general defects must be watched for and avoided as in the Pekin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. Upper--White Call Duck. Lower--White Call Drake.\r\n(_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_The Black East India._ This is a black breed which is small in size\r\nbeing a bantam duck like the Call. As a matter of fact it is a miniature\r\nCayuga. The color should be black throughout and the same color\r\ncharacteristics hold true as in the case of the Cayuga. The same color\r\ndefects must therefore be guarded against, the worst one being white in\r\nthe breast of females especially. Avoid breeding from a drake with a\r\nblack bill as in this respect the breed differs from the Cayuga since\r\nthe bill of the duck should be black but that of the drake should be\r\nvery dark green. Purple barring must be carefully selected against.\r\n\r\n_The Muscovy._ This breed differs in certain respects very markedly from\r\nthe other standard breeds of ducks. They are long and broad in body\r\nwhich is carried in a horizontal position but are not so deep in keel as\r\nthe Pekin, Aylesbury or Rouen. The longest bodied young ducks will make\r\nthe largest individuals. The head should have feathers on the top which\r\ncan be elevated at will to form a crest. Guard against breeders having\r\nsmooth heads, or in other words, lacking a crest. The face is covered\r\nwith corrugations or caruncles and should be red in color. At the base\r\nof the upper bill there is a sort of knob-like formation in the drake\r\nwhich serves as one of the distinguishing characteristics between the\r\nduck and drake of this breed. The more prominent the knob and the more\r\nwrinkled or corrugated the face the better is the specimen in this\r\nrespect. The wings are long and strong and these birds fly very well.\r\nThey will also climb fences. The drakes are quite pugnacious and fight\r\none another badly at times. They are especially pugnacious when they\r\nhave young.\r\n\r\nThis breed of ducks will often roost on roosts like chickens or in the\r\ntrees or on the barn. They do not quack like other ducks and unlike\r\nother domesticated breeds which moult two or three times a year, they\r\nmoult only once, taking longer to do so, usually about 90 days, although\r\nthe female may complete her moult a little sooner. The period of\r\nincubation for Muscovy eggs is longer, being from 33 to 35 days as\r\ncompared to 28 days for other breeds. In size the male and female differ\r\nconsiderably as will be seen from the standard weights given (See Page\r\n14), the male being considerably larger. These ducks lay well, the\r\nfertility runs good, the eggs hatch well, and the little ducks are hardy\r\nand easily raised. They are a broody breed. The ducks will make their\r\nnests and hatch out their eggs if allowed to do so and are excellent\r\nmothers. Sometimes they will fly up and make their nests in a hollow\r\ntree. A Muscovy duck can cover properly about 20 eggs. In spite of the\r\nfact that they fly well they are easily domesticated. It takes about\r\ntwo years for the males of this breed to fully mature although the ducks\r\nget their full size when one year of age. The Muscovy is perhaps the\r\nbest general purpose breed for a farm flock.\r\n\r\nThe extent and intensity of the red of the face increases up to maturity\r\nand the redder the face the better. The plumage of the Muscovy is not as\r\ndowny or oily as other breeds, the feathers being harder. For this\r\nreason the birds are more apt to become water soaked and to drown as a\r\nresult when they have not been accustomed to water in which to swim.\r\nThis is especially true of the drakes on account of their large size and\r\nlong wing feathers. Muscovy ducks dress well, having a rich yellow skin,\r\nand therefore make a good market duck, although the difference in size\r\nof the duck and drake and the dark pin feathers of the Colored variety\r\nare disadvantages from a market standpoint. Select against breeders\r\nwhich run small in size as there is more or less of a tendency for this\r\nbreed to decrease in size. The Muscovy is long lived, specimens having\r\nbeen known to breed until they were eight or ten years of age.\r\n\r\n_The Colored Muscovy._ Although the standard calls for more or less\r\nwhite in different sections of this variety, as a matter of fact\r\nbreeders desire to get the birds as dark as possible except for a very\r\nsmall patch of white on the breast and a small patch of white on the\r\ncenter of the wing. Indeed, birds without the white on the breast and\r\nwith very little on the wing are valuable breeders since there is a\r\ntendency for too much white to occur in the plumage. Occasionally all\r\nblack birds occur and these can be used to advantage in breeding when\r\nthere is a tendency toward too much white in plumage. Plumage more than\r\nhalf white is a disqualification. The dark plumage birds such as are\r\nwanted are very likely to show considerable black or gypsy color in the\r\nface which should be a good red. This must be selected against insofar\r\nas possible. The nearly black or the darkest birds are quite likely to\r\nshow some white or grizzling on the head. Grizzled or brownish penciled\r\nfeathers sometimes occur in various parts of the plumage and must of\r\ncourse be guarded against as the markings should be distinctly black and\r\nwhite. The baby ducks of this variety are quite apt to show considerable\r\nwhite although the best of them come yellowish black. This variety tends\r\nto run a little larger in size than the white variety although the\r\nstandard weights are the same for both. Dun or chocolate colored ducks\r\nsometimes come from Colored Muscovies while Blue Muscovies can be\r\nproduced by crossing the Colored and the white varieties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. Upper--Colored Muscovy Drake. Notice the partly\r\nerect crest feather on top of the head. Lower--White Muscovy Drake.\r\nNotice the long, horizontal body and the rough or carunculated face.\r\n(_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_The White Muscovy._ This variety should have pure white plumage\r\nthroughout. Young Muscovies of both sexes often have a patch of black on\r\ntop of the head up to the time they moult at maturity. Since black\r\ndisqualifies it is impossible to show young ducks in this condition but\r\nthese black feathers usually come in white after the moult and such\r\nbirds need not therefore be discarded as breeders. When it is desired to\r\nshow young White Muscovies which have black on the head it is customary\r\nto pluck these black feathers a sufficient time before the show so that\r\nthe white feathers which come in their place will have time to grow out.\r\nThere is little or no trouble with black or gypsy face in this variety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. Upper--Crested White Drake. Lower--Young White\r\nMuscovy duck showing black on top of the head. This is not an unusual\r\noccurrence and the black is lost when the bird gets its mature plumage\r\nin the fall. (_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_The Blue Swedish._ In type and size this breed is about the same as the\r\nCayuga although perhaps slightly more upstanding. In selecting the\r\nmating it is important to use birds which are close to standard weight\r\nas there is somewhat of a tendency for the size to be too small. As its\r\nname indicates the color is largely blue except for a white heart-shaped\r\npatch or bib which should be present on the breast. Sometimes this white\r\nextends along the underside of the body from the under-bill almost to\r\nthe vent. Such birds are undesirable as breeders since they show too\r\nmuch white. On the other hand birds lacking a prominent white bib must\r\nalso be avoided. Two of the flight feathers should be white and birds\r\nlacking these must be avoided. Guard against any red, gray or black in\r\nany part of the plumage. Sometimes, however, birds having more or less\r\nblack throughout the plumage are used as breeders for the purpose of\r\nstrengthening the blue color. Avoid any tendency toward a ribbon on the\r\nwing-bow and also birds that are too light, ashy or washed out in the\r\nblue color.\r\n\r\nSometimes birds show lines of white feathers around the eyes and over\r\nthe head and these should be selected against as breeders as they are\r\nlikely to cause white splashing in the plumage. Yellow or greenish bills\r\nmust likewise be avoided since the first of these is a disqualification.\r\nIn general this variety in breeding behaves insofar as color is\r\nconcerned, very much like the Blue Andalusian chicken.[3] The young\r\nducks when hatched are yellow or creamy blue and from blue matings there\r\nare also produced black and white ducklings. As in other colored breeds\r\nand varieties, the dark pin feathers are somewhat of a disadvantage from\r\na market standpoint.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: For a detailed discussion of the behaviour of the Blue\r\nAndalusian in breeding, the reader is referred to \"The Mating and\r\nBreeding of Poultry\" by Harry M. Lamon and Rob R. Slocum, published by\r\nthe Orange Judd Publishing Company, New York City.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. Blue Swedish duck showing white flight feathers.\r\nThe Standard calls for only two white flights, but there is a decided\r\ntendency as shown here for more flights to be white. (_Photograph from\r\nthe Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_The Crested White._ Although not so large, this breed is much like the\r\nPekin but with body carried more nearly horizontal and with a crest on\r\nthe head. The type varies considerably however, the principal selection\r\npracticed having been for crest. The plumage is white in color\r\nthroughout. What is desired in the crest is to have as large a one as\r\npossible, round and perfect in form, and set squarely on the head. Not\r\ninfrequently crooked crests occur and also double or split crests, that\r\nis to say, where the crest is parted or divided. In some cases the\r\ncrests may even come treble, that is, split into three parts. Entire\r\nabsence of crest is by no means uncommon. In fact, it is considered a\r\npretty good proportion if one half of the ducks hatched have crests\r\nalthough the matings vary considerably in this, occasionally one\r\nproducing practically 100% of the offspring with crests. Avoid as\r\nbreeders birds with small crests, lopped crests, split crests or showing\r\nan absence of crest. Avoid also breeders showing mottled or green bills\r\nin females and black bean in the bill of drakes.\r\n\r\n_The Buff._ In type this breed is similar to the Swedish. As will be\r\nseen from the standard weights it is one of the medium sized breeds and\r\nmakes a very nice market bird as it dresses out into a nice round fat\r\ncarcass and is a good layer. In color the birds of both sexes should be\r\nas uniform a buff as possible except that the head and upper part of the\r\nneck in the drake should be seal brown when in full plumage. Color\r\ndefects which are likely to be encountered and which should be avoided\r\nare the tendency for the head of the drake to run to a chestnut color\r\nand for his neck to be too light or faded out in color. Sometimes the\r\nhead of the drake runs too dark in color approaching a greenish black\r\nlike the head of the Rouen. This is of course undesirable. The wings of\r\nboth sexes are apt to run to light or even in some cases, pure white\r\nflights. Blue wing bars are sometimes shown and these must be carefully\r\navoided. Penciling such as is found in the Fawn and White Runner\r\nsometimes occurs and since it is a serious defect must be rigidly\r\nguarded against. Any tendency toward a white bib or a white ring around\r\nthe neck of both sexes must likewise be avoided. Greenish or mottled\r\nbills must be avoided in ducks which are to be used as breeders. Not\r\nmuch trouble is experienced in the bill of drakes which as a rule comes\r\ngood. Any blue cast in the feathers on the rump and back of both sexes\r\nmust be selected against. As a rule the females of this breed tend to be\r\nbetter colored than the males. At certain periods of the moult the head\r\ncoloring of the drakes becomes a good buff color and later when the\r\nmoult is complete, it changes to a copper color. When hatched the\r\nducklings are a creamy yellow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13. Pair of Buff Ducks--Drake on the right\r\n(_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_The Runner._ The type of this breed is quite different from that of the\r\nother breed of ducks and type is very important. The Runner wants to be\r\ndecidedly upstanding and to be very reachy. It should have very slim\r\nslender lines. The neck should be straight and the head should be\r\ncarried at right angles to the neck. The bill should be perfectly\r\nstraight on top and on a line with the skull showing absolutely no\r\ntendency to be dished. The legs of this breed are longer than those of\r\nother ducks and this accounts for the fact that they run rather than\r\nwaddle when they move about. It is from this fact that they get their\r\nname. They are very active and are troublesome about crawling through\r\nfences. They are good layers and non-sitters and they have often been\r\ncalled the Leghorns of the duck family. It must be remembered, however,\r\nthat while they have the inherent ability to lay as well as hens they\r\nwill do this only when they receive proper feed and care. It is quite\r\nuseless to expect a high egg yield from them when they are carelessly\r\nfed and improperly housed and cared for. Avoid as breeders ducks of both\r\nsexes that are too heavy behind, or in other words, are too\r\nheavy-bottomed. Avoid birds which are too short in legs. Avoid crooked\r\nor sharp backs. Round heads must likewise be avoided.\r\n\r\n_The Fawn and White Runner._ In this variety the markings must be very\r\ndistinct and definite. There is a tendency which must be avoided for the\r\nhead to run to black instead of chestnut, especially in males. It is\r\nlikewise necessary to avoid females which tend to show penciling on the\r\nsides of the breast or on the wing-bows. These defects are apt to be\r\nassociated with colored flight feathers which is also a defect to be\r\navoided. Guard against too much fawn extending up the neck from the body\r\nto the head as the neck should be white in color. Too dark tail coverts\r\napproaching a greenish black sometimes occur and are undesirable. In\r\ntype this variety will not average quite as good as the White.\r\n\r\n_The White Runner._ This variety is best in type and it likewise runs\r\ngood in color which should be white throughout. Sometimes foreign color\r\nwill be shown in the back of females and this of course must be avoided.\r\nAlso avoid birds as breeders with green or mottled bills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14. Penciled Runner Drake on left and White Runner\r\nDrake on right. (_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_The Penciled Runner._ In type this variety runs about the same as the\r\nFawn and White. The color combination is rather difficult to breed as it\r\nis hard to get the good penciling desired in the female together with\r\nthe white markings. In general, in breeding this variety there is a\r\ntendency to pay more attention to type than to color. The penciling is\r\nlike that of the Rouen but lighter in color consisting of a brown\r\npenciling on a fawn colored ground. Avoid any grayish stippling on the\r\nbreast of the drake and also on the wing-bows. These defects are likely\r\nto be associated with colored flights which are undesirable. The colored\r\nportion of the head of the drake is darker than that of the duck in this\r\nvariety. Avoid lack of white on the neck in both sexes and avoid females\r\nwhich are lacking in penciling.\r\n\r\n_Preparing Ducks for the Show._ Aside from selecting the individuals\r\nwhich most nearly approach the standard requirements there is very\r\nlittle which can be done in the way of preparing the birds for the show\r\nas these fowls are practically self-prepared. For a period of at least a\r\nweek or ten days before they are shipped to the show those intended for\r\nexhibition should be given access to a grass range and also if possible\r\nto running water. The grass range will keep them in good condition and\r\nthe running water will allow them to clean themselves. Any broken\r\nfeathers should be plucked at least six weeks before the birds are to be\r\nshown in order to allow the feathers time enough to grow out again. It\r\nmust be remembered that most ducks after getting in a good condition of\r\nflesh do not tend to hold this for a very long period but soon grow\r\nthinner again and will not take on fat the second time for some little\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nOften there will be a difference in weight as high as 3 pounds when a\r\nduck is in good condition and after it has thinned. In order to have the\r\nducks in top form, therefore, it is necessary to bring them up to flesh\r\nat the proper time. In order to bring ducks which are to be exhibited up\r\nto standard weight, they should be fed twice daily, for at least 10 days\r\nbefore shipping, a grain mixture consisting of one part corn and two\r\nparts oats. Give them all they will eat of this mixture. With Runners\r\nand the small breeds of ducks there is a danger of their putting on too\r\nmuch weight if corn is used in the ration and it is therefore best to\r\ngive them oats alone. When the birds are shipped to the show they are\r\nquite likely to get their plumage soiled during the journey. When this\r\noccurs fill a barrel about half full of water. Then as the ducks are\r\ntaken out of the shipping coops take three of them at a time, put them\r\nin the barrel and cover it over, leaving them for a few minutes. When\r\nthey are taken out they will usually be clean.\r\n\r\n\r\nCatching and Handling Ducks\r\n\r\nDucks should never be caught by the legs which are short and weak and\r\nare very likely to be injured. For the same reason they should never be\r\ncarried by the legs. Ducks should be caught by the neck, grasping them\r\njust below the head. They can be carried short distances without injury\r\nin this way but it is not advisable to carry fat ducks by the neck for\r\nany considerable distance. The best way to handle them is to catch them\r\nby the neck, then carry them on the arm with the legs in the hand just\r\nas one would carry a chicken. See Fig. 15. A scoop net about 18 inches\r\nin diameter and with a six foot handle can also be used to excellent\r\nadvantage in catching ducks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. Two methods of carrying ducks. (_Photographs\r\nfrom the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPacking and Shipping Hatching Eggs\r\n\r\nEggs for hatching must be shipped when they are fresh as duck eggs tend\r\nto deteriorate in quality quite rapidly. They may be shipped fairly long\r\ndistances. Shipment may be made either by express or by Parcel Post. In\r\norder to prevent breakage and to lessen the effects of the jar to which\r\nthe eggs are subjected during shipment, they must be carefully packed.\r\nOne of the best methods is to use an ordinary market basket. Line the\r\nbasket well on the bottom and sides with excelsior. Wrap each egg in\r\npaper and then wrap in excelsior so that there will be a good thick\r\ncushion of excelsior between the eggs and they will not be allowed to\r\ncome in contact with one another. Pack the eggs in the basket securely\r\nstanding them on end so that they cannot move or shift around. Cover\r\nthe top of the eggs with a thick layer of excelsior using enough so that\r\nit runs up well above the sides of the basket. Over the top sew a piece\r\nof strong cotton cloth. Instead of sewing the cloth it can be pushed up\r\nunder the outside rim of the basket with a case knife, this being\r\nquicker and equally as effective as sewing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nCommercial Duck Farming--Location--Estimate of Equipment and Capital\r\nNecessary in Starting the Business\r\n\r\n\r\n_Distribution._ Commercial Duck farming is confined very largely to the\r\nsections within easy shipping distance of the larger cities. A great\r\nmajority of these farms are located about New York City, particularly on\r\nLong Island. Some duck farms are located on the Pacific Coast and a few\r\ncommercial plants are scattered about here and there throughout the\r\ncountry. The size of these farms ranges all the way from plants with an\r\noutput of 5,000 or 10,000 ducklings up to those with an output around\r\n100,000 yearly.\r\n\r\n_Stock Used._ The stock used on the commercial duck plants of the United\r\nStates consists exclusively of the Pekin. The reasons for the use of\r\nthis particular breed are the fact that it has white plumage and\r\ntherefore dresses out well, that it is of good size, that its egg\r\nproduction is good, and that it makes quick growth.\r\n\r\n_Location of Plant._ On Long Island the commercial duck plants are\r\nlocated along the streams, especially those on the southern shore of the\r\nIsland, which empty into the various bays. Locations along these\r\nstreams are not easy to secure at the present time owing to the fact\r\nthat duck farms are not allowed in many sections where summer homes have\r\nbeen built. A water site of this sort is very valuable, although not\r\nabsolutely essential, since it provides water yards for the breeding\r\nducks and for the fattening ducklings if desired, and reduces the labor\r\nand cost of equipment materially since the ducks always have access to\r\nwater and no additional provision need be made to provide them with\r\ndrinking water. It also enables the ducks to keep their plumage clean.\r\nUsually these locations are on fresh water streams but some of them are\r\nfurther out toward the bay where the water is salty or at least\r\nbrackish.\r\n\r\nThe mature ducks thrive well on the salt water and do not have to be\r\nfurnished with fresh drinking water in addition. For the young ducks,\r\nhowever, with a salt water location it is necessary to provide fresh\r\ndrinking water. A few farms in other sections of the country are what\r\nare known as dry land farms, that is to say, they are not situated on\r\nthe bank of a stream. In such locations running water is carried through\r\nthe yards so that the ducks have an ample supply of drinking water and\r\nin some cases artificial ponds are constructed to provide water in which\r\nthe breeding ducks can swim. Formerly the idea was universally held that\r\nswimming water was essential for the breeders in order to secure good\r\nfertility, and many duck farmers still believe that better results can\r\nbe secured in this way. On some of the dry land duck farms, however,\r\nbreeding ducks are successfully kept without such swimming places. The\r\nyoung market ducklings do not require water to swim in although some\r\nraisers prefer to have it and it is commonly allowed where readily\r\navailable. On the dry land farms provision is made simply for a\r\ncontinuous supply of fresh drinking water for the fattening ducklings.\r\nDucklings kept out of the water, do not take as much exercise and, in\r\nconsequence, fatten a little more readily.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaking a Start in Duck Farming\r\n\r\nDuck farms or plants are sometimes operated on a considerable scale at\r\nthe beginning, the plans being carefully laid by some experienced duck\r\nman. In these cases, operations at the start may be of sufficient\r\nmagnitude so that the output will amount to 15,000 or 20,000 ducklings\r\nin a year. In most cases, however, these places have been the result of\r\na more gradual growth from a small beginning, a condition made necessary\r\neither by the inexperience of the grower or by lack of capital. Not\r\ninfrequently men engaged in other forms of farming but possessing a\r\nsuitable location will keep 200 or 300 breeding ducks and from this\r\ngradually build up a good sized duck plant.\r\n\r\n_Equipment, Capital, etc. Required._ The estimates given as to the\r\namount of equipment and capital required are based on the assumption\r\nthat a plant is to be operated of sufficient size to have a yearly\r\noutput of about 30,000 ducklings. It must be understood in this\r\nconnection that location and various other conditions or circumstances\r\nwill influence the cost of different items of equipment and for this\r\nreason these estimates must not be considered as absolute but should\r\nrather serve as a guide or basis on which to figure. The figures here\r\ngiven contemplate the building up of an establishment which is efficient\r\nbut which is in no particular elaborate, the buildings and other\r\nequipment being as simple and inexpensive as possible.\r\n\r\n_Lay-out or Arrangement of the Plant._ The plant must be carefully\r\nplanned so as to make the best possible use of the land and particularly\r\nof the water frontage. It is particularly important to arrange the\r\nbuildings in such a manner as to cut down labor as much as possible. If\r\nthere is any expectation of enlarging the capacity at some future time,\r\nthis must also be borne in mind in the arrangement of the various\r\nbuildings and yards. The incubator cellar should be convenient to the\r\nNo. 1 brooder house and the various brooder houses to one another. The\r\nbrooder house must likewise be convenient to the growing and fattening\r\nhouses and yards and these in turn to the killing house. The feed room\r\nshould be centrally located so as to save labor as much as possible in\r\nfeeding the ducks.\r\n\r\n_Land Required._ For a duck plant of the size indicated 10 acres of land\r\nshould be ample. This, however, means that no effort would be made to\r\ngrow any of the feed for the ducks or ducklings with the exception of\r\ngreen feed. In some cases where the lay of the land is unusually\r\nfavorable so that the plant can be laid out to the very best advantage,\r\na smaller amount of ground than this might be sufficient but it is not\r\nwell to figure on less than 10 acres.\r\n\r\n_Number of Breeders Required._ With the usual methods of management and\r\nwith good success, one may estimate that 40 young ducks can be marketed\r\neach year from each breeding female. This is a good average although in\r\nsome good years duck raisers will do a little better than this. On the\r\nother hand in poor years they will not do so well. For a plant having an\r\noutput of 30,000 market ducks there would therefore be needed in the\r\nneighborhood of 800 breeding ducks in addition to 100 drakes.\r\n\r\n_Housing Required for Breeders._ In figuring on the amount of housing\r\nrequired for this number of breeding ducks, it is necessary to figure on\r\n2-1/2 to 3 square feet of floor space per bird, 3 square feet being better\r\nthan 2-1/2. This would require a housing space 20 feet deep by 120 feet\r\nlong. However ducks are not usually housed in one building of this size,\r\nand in fact it is better not to do so since the smaller the flock of\r\nbreeders kept together the better they will do. In no case should a duck\r\nraiser run more than 400 ducks in a flock and it is very much better to\r\nrun them in pens of 100 each. In fact, some breeders do not place more\r\nthan 25 to 50 breeding ducks in a pen.\r\n\r\n_Incubator Capacity._ Incubators are used exclusively for hatching the\r\neggs. At the present time in practically all cases some form of hot\r\nwater mammoth incubator is utilized for this purpose. An investment is\r\nrequired both in incubators and in a cellar in which to operate them. In\r\nfiguring on the incubator capacity necessary to take care of a\r\nproposition of this size, it is necessary to base the estimate on the\r\nnumber of eggs produced during the season of flush production. The duck\r\nraiser figures on incubating all eggs suitable for the purpose rather\r\nthan to sell any of them for other purposes as there is a greater profit\r\nin rearing and marketing the ducklings. For that reason he must have\r\nincubator capacity enough to take care of all the eggs laid at any time\r\nof the year. During the season of flush production the yield will\r\nordinarily run in the neighborhood of 80%. The period of incubation is\r\n28 days but 2 days more should be added to this to allow for cleaning\r\nout the machines, etc., before starting another hatch. This means that\r\nthere would be 30 days between hatches. Figuring on 800 ducks with an\r\n80% production for 30 days an incubator capacity of around 19,200 eggs\r\nwould be required.\r\n\r\n_Brooder Capacity._ A brooder house capacity, where artificial heat can\r\nbe supplied, sufficient to take care of about half of the total output\r\nof the plant at one time is necessary. This means there would have to\r\nbe on this plant a heated brooder house capacity for 15,000 ducklings.\r\nAbout half of this number or 7500 would need accommodations in the\r\nnumber 1 or warmest brooder house where the heat can be kept up to 65 or\r\n70 degrees in the house itself, and warmer of course under the hover.\r\nThe other 7500 ducklings capacity would be in the number 2 house, that\r\nis, a house where heat could be supplied in the early spring and where\r\nthe temperature could be run up to 60 degrees. Hovers in such a house\r\nare not really needed but it is common to cover the hot waterpipes with\r\na platform in order to provide a runway on which one can run a wheel\r\nbarrow and thus simplify feeding. Ordinarily after May 1 no heat is\r\nneeded in the number 2 brooder house. The young ducks are usually 2 to 3\r\nweeks old when they go into the number 2 house and they stay there for\r\nabout 2 weeks depending on the weather. Heat for the brooder houses is\r\nsupplied by means of hot water pipes and a coal burning stove such as\r\nare used in brooder houses for chickens. A number 3 or cold brooder\r\nhouse is also needed where ducklings can be housed and can be driven in\r\nat night and in cold weather after they have graduated from the number 2\r\nhouse. From the number 3 house a part of the ducklings are taken\r\ndirectly to the yards where they are housed in open front sheds.\r\n\r\n_Fattening Houses or Sheds._ In addition to the brooder houses, there\r\nare required fattening houses or sheds for the ducks when they are moved\r\nfrom the No. 3 brooder house to the yards. Suitable houses for this\r\npurpose are 16 feet deep by 24 feet long. In front they are 5 feet high\r\nand in the rear 3-1/2 feet. They are set on posts with a base board around\r\nto make them tight. The fronts are entirely open and provided with\r\ncurtains which are used only in the winter to keep out the snow. The\r\nducklings are shut in these houses when desired by means of wire panels\r\nwhich close the lower part of the front. Houses such as described are\r\ndivided into two parts and each side will accommodate 200 ducklings.\r\n\r\n_Feed Storage._ Considerable feed storage room is necessary as it is\r\nvery desirable to be able to buy feed in quantity and also to carry a\r\nconsiderable stock on hand in order to offset the possibility of not\r\nbeing able to secure feed at any time. There should be storage capacity\r\nfor 4 cars of 30 tons each, in other words, for 120 tons of feed. Still\r\ngreater capacity than this is desirable. In connection with the feed\r\nstorage there should be a place where the feed can be mixed and where\r\nfeed can be cooked. Two power operated feed mixers are required as one\r\nis not sufficient during the busy season to allow the mixing and feeding\r\nof the mash for both the breeders and the young stock at the same time.\r\nA feed cutter is necessary in preparing the green feed which is mixed in\r\nthe mash. The usual type of kettle feed cooker is commonly used for\r\nboiling fish and preparing other cooked feeds but in its place a small\r\nfour-horse steam boiler can be utilized to good advantage as this makes\r\nit possible to cook the feed right in the mixer by using a steam hose.\r\n\r\n_Killing and Picking House._ A killing and picking house where the ducks\r\ncan be prepared for market is another necessary building but this need\r\nnot be an expensive building. It must be located with reference to its\r\nconvenience to the rest of the plant. It is also desirable to locate it\r\nover a spring if one is available for the spring water can be used to\r\nexcellent advantage in cooling the dressed ducklings. When a spring is\r\nnot available water must be piped to this building. The killing house is\r\nusually built with at least one side open or partly open. A place is\r\nprovided outside the picking room where the ducks can be hung and bled.\r\nInside room is required for six or eight pickers. A kettle for heating\r\nwater to be used in scalding the ducks is necessary as are also tanks in\r\nwhich to place the ducks after they are picked. Additional room is\r\nneeded where the ducks can be weighed and packed ready for shipment.\r\n\r\n_Residence._ In addition to the other buildings enumerated, a residence\r\nwould of course be necessary. The size and elaborateness of this and\r\nconsequently its cost depends entirely upon the owner's needs and\r\nwishes.\r\n\r\n_Horse Power._ One horse and wagon for the purpose of drawing the feed\r\nabout the plant and for certain other necessary work would be required.\r\nIf the owner desires to do his own hauling of the feed from the railroad\r\nand the other necessary trucking he would, of course, have to keep more\r\nhorses, a team at least, or an automobile truck. Where only one horse is\r\nkept, this trucking must be hired done.\r\n\r\n_Feeding Track._ On many of the larger duck farms, a feed track is\r\nemployed in feeding the stock. Such a track consists of a framework of\r\nsufficient strength to support a car filled with mash which is pushed\r\nalong the track by hand. The track leads from the feed mixer across the\r\nvarious yards where the ducks to be fed are located, including both the\r\nbreeding ducks, yard ducks and brooder ducks in yards. This involves a\r\nconsiderable amount of trackage which must be fairly level and which\r\nruns over the yard fences or along the ends of the yards so that the\r\nfeed can be shoveled directly from the car into the feeding trays in the\r\nyards. The use of a feed track simplifies the feeding considerably but\r\nits construction is quite expensive. Where a track is not used, the feed\r\nas mixed is dumped into a low wagon which is driven along the yards, or\r\nthrough them by removing movable panels in the fences and the feed\r\nshoveled from the wagon to the feed trays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16. Power feed mixer. The feed is dumped into a low\r\nwagon from which it is shoveled to the ducks. (_Photograph from the\r\nBureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_Electric Lights._ Most duck farms at the present time are located where\r\nelectric lighting is available. It is desirable and in fact almost\r\nnecessary to have the various houses wired so that lights can be turned\r\non when desired. In addition, lights are usually provided in the yards\r\nfor fattening ducks and are used at night and especially during storms\r\nto keep the ducks from stampeding.\r\n\r\n_Water Supply._ An adequate water supply is essential. This will consist\r\nof a well or spring furnishing an ample amount of water, a power pump\r\nand a water supply tank. From the tank, the water must be piped to the\r\nincubator cellar, the brooder houses, the killing house, the feed house\r\nand to any of the yards where the ducks do not have access to a natural\r\nsupply of good water. In addition, of course, the water from the same\r\ntank is usually used to supply the residence.\r\n\r\n_Fences._ Not a great deal of investment is necessary in fences since\r\nthe yards are rather small and the fences are low. Two-foot fences of\r\ntwo-inch mesh wire are used for the yard ducks while for the little\r\nducks 18-inch wire of one-inch mesh is used. The biggest items of\r\nexpense connected with the fences are the cost of the stakes or posts\r\nused in their construction and the labor used in this work. The portion\r\nof the yards extending into the water are the most troublesome and most\r\nexpensive to build. In some cases, rather elaborate wooden picket fences\r\nare used in the water yards. These are more permanent but are more\r\nexpensive to build.\r\n\r\n_Labor._ For a plant of the size indicated there would be required in\r\naddition to an active working proprietor three other men. One man would\r\nbe needed to operate the incubators, one man would devote his time to\r\nthe brooder houses, one man would feed the yard ducks and the fattening\r\npens, and one man would do the killing and packing, take care of the\r\nfeathers, clean the yards, etc. Of course, there would be periods when\r\nthese men would not have their entire time taken up with their\r\nparticular duties and this would permit them to turn in and help with\r\nthe miscellaneous work on the plant.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the regular men employed, additional labor would be\r\nnecessary to do the picking. For this purpose pickers are usually\r\nbrought in and work by the piece. During the spring of 1920 these\r\npickers received six cents per duck and they will average about 75 ducks\r\na day, beginning work at 6 in the morning and finishing by noon or a\r\nlittle later. Some pickers will average as high as 100 ducks a day. In\r\nthe busy season from 800 to 1200 ducks will be marketed per week and the\r\nusual practice is to kill and pick not over three days a week, usually\r\nduring the first part of the week.\r\n\r\n_Invested Capital._ Investment in the business exclusive of working\r\ncapital, that is to say, the money in the land and buildings and other\r\nequipment would require under present conditions about $1,000 for each\r\nthousand ducks marketed. In other words, in a plant of this size, close\r\nto $30,000 would be invested. The amount of invested capital depends to\r\nsome extent upon location and upon the elaborateness of the buildings\r\nand other equipment but with a well laid out economical plant an\r\ninvestment of the size indicated should be sufficient.\r\n\r\n_Working Capital._ In addition to the capital invested in the plant\r\nthere would be required a considerable amount of working capital. From\r\nthe first of November to the beginning of the marketing of the ducks\r\nthere would be required from $6,000 to $8,000 with which to purchase\r\nfeed, meet the pay roll, and for other running expenses. Even after the\r\nmarketing begins there would be a period of from a month to six weeks\r\nwhen the expenses will continue to be greater than the receipts so that\r\nsome additional capital might be necessary. However, returns would begin\r\nto come in which could be used to take care of the more pressing current\r\nobligations so that additional working capital which might be needed\r\nover that indicated would not be large.\r\n\r\n_Profits._ The profits in commercial duck raising vary widely, as must\r\nbe expected, depending upon the management, upon the season and upon\r\nprices received. After deducting all overhead charges and interest on\r\nthe investment, the net return per duck should be at least 10 cents per\r\nduckling marketed. In fact the return should be 15 cents to provide much\r\ninducement to engage in the business. Some seasons the returns will run\r\ngreater than this but on the other hand, there is always the chance of\r\noccasional big losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCommercial Duck Farming--Management of the Breeding Stock\r\n\r\n\r\n_Age of Breeders._ On most large commercial duck plants the entire\r\nbreeding stock is renewed each year. In other words, the breeders are\r\nkept only through their first laying season. This makes it necessary to\r\nselect from the young stock reared and save for breeders as many head as\r\nit is desired to carry for the coming year. This practice is used for\r\nthe reason that ducks lay best during their first year. Therefore, since\r\nit is desired to keep up the maximum egg production in order to raise as\r\nmany market ducks as possible, young breeders are considered better.\r\nSome raisers, however, keep a part of their breeding ducks for two years\r\nand occasionally for 3 or even 4 years but this is not the usual\r\npractice. Recent comparison made between young and two year old ducks as\r\nbreeders would seem to indicate that ducklings hatched from the eggs of\r\nthe latter live a little better.\r\n\r\n_Distinguishing Young from Old Ducks._ In this connection it is of\r\ninterest to know how young ducks can be readily distinguished from the\r\nolder birds. The young ducks have bright yellow legs and bills while\r\nthe old ducks after a period of laying, lose a considerable amount of\r\nthe yellow from these sections. In addition, soon after the ducks begin\r\nto lay, their bills as a rule will begin to be streaked with black.\r\nYoung ducks can also be told from the old ducks by feeling of the end of\r\nthe breast bone which runs to a point at the abdomen. In the older ducks\r\nthis is hard while in the young ducks it is gristly and bends easily.\r\nThe windpipe of an old duck is hard and rather difficult to compress or\r\ndent while in the young duck it is softer and easily dented.\r\n\r\n_Selection of Breeding Ducks._ The breeders are usually selected from\r\nthe ducklings which reach market age from the last week in June through\r\nJuly. As these lots become ready for market and are driven into the pens\r\nto be slaughtered each duck is handled and any especially good birds\r\nwhich the proprietor thinks will make good breeders are thrown out at\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\nIn making selection of breeders those are chosen which are healthy and\r\nthrifty and which have good wide, long and deep bodies. Ducks with\r\ncrooked wings, crooked tails, hump backs or paddle legs are rejected for\r\nthis purpose. After the young ducks for breeders are selected they are\r\nput in a yard or fattening pen until the number which the owner expects\r\nto keep is complete. These young breeders generally begin to moult soon\r\nafter they are selected and from this time on they are fed whole corn\r\nand plenty of green feed until it is time to begin feeding the laying\r\nration. Some of the breeding ducks will usually begin to lay about\r\nDecember 1 although they will not lay heavily at that time. The laying\r\nration described later should be begun about that time or a couple of\r\nweeks earlier.\r\n\r\n_Number of Females to a Drake._ As a rule on commercial duck farms the\r\nbirds are mated in the proportion of about one drake to seven ducks.\r\nThis proportion will vary to some extent under different methods of\r\nmanagement and weather conditions and may run all the way from 1 to 5 to\r\n1 to 8. The smaller number of drakes should be used late in the season\r\nwhile the larger number will give better fertility early in the breeding\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nSince the drakes do not fight seriously, flock matings can be made.\r\nBetter results will be obtained from smaller flocks than from large\r\nflocks and there will also be less cracked eggs and less very dirty eggs\r\nfrom the smaller flocks. Before the ducks are let out in the morning\r\nthere is a tendency for them to run back and forth through the pens, and\r\nin this way they tramp over many of the eggs which are laid anywhere\r\nabout the floor. The larger the flock the more cracked and dirty eggs\r\nwill result. While the drakes do not fight each other they do at times\r\ninjure and kill the ducks to some extent when three or four drakes may\r\nchase one duck. In this way they may injure the ducks' backs and often\r\npick their eyes and necks. Whenever a duck is found which is injured she\r\nshould be removed from the flock. Difficulty of this sort is most\r\nprevalent about the 1st of March. If the trouble gets very bad it can be\r\nstopped to some extent by cutting back the upper bills of the drakes\r\nabout one-fourth of an inch with a tinsnip or by reducing the proportion\r\nof drakes.\r\n\r\n_Securing Breeding Drakes._ It is common practice on duck plants to\r\navoid inbreeding by securing drakes from some other flock each year.\r\nThis is usually accomplished by buying the drakes outright from some\r\nneighboring duck farmer. It may also be accomplished by purchasing a few\r\neggs for hatching in order to secure new blood. In any particular\r\ncommunity there is a tendency for the duck farmers to trade breeding\r\ndrakes among themselves for a period of years with the result that they\r\nall have much the same blood and not a great deal of benefit is obtained\r\nfrom securing the drakes from some neighbor's flock. It is undoubtedly\r\ngood practice to go farther afield occasionally for a supply of breeding\r\ndrakes. In purchasing stock for new blood be sure that it is as good as\r\nthe home stock and better if it can be found. It will do no good to\r\npurchase and use inferior stock and may do much harm.\r\n\r\n\r\nHouses and Yards for Breeders\r\n\r\nThe breeding flocks are usually confined to breeding yards. The size of\r\nthese yards depends upon the size of the breeding flock but large yards\r\nare not required. A yard for 200 breeders is not as a rule larger\r\nthan 100 by 200 feet including the water part of the yard. Houses and\r\nyards should be located on sand if possible as this is easier to keep\r\nclean and therefore keeps the birds in better condition. Occasional\r\nflocks of breeding ducks are allowed their liberty but this is not\r\ncommon practice nor is it good practice unless the surroundings are\r\nclean and the ducks do not have access to stagnant mud or refuse in\r\nwhich they can work. If ducks work too much in this kind of material\r\nthey will eat more or less of it which injures the eggs for hatching\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nMany different styles of houses are used for breeders, some of which are\r\ndecidedly more elaborate than is necessary. A very satisfactory\r\neconomical house is one 20 feet deep, 7 feet high in front and 4 feet at\r\nback, with a shed roof. This can be constructed of tongue and groove\r\nmaterial or may be made of unmatched stuff and covered with paper. A\r\nhouse of this proportion makes a good light house and it can be carried\r\nin length according to the size of the flock. For a breeding unit of 200\r\nducks, which is a good unit to use, a house 20 feet deep and 30 to 40\r\nfeet long is suitable. No floor is used in the house but it should be\r\nwell filled up with dirt so that the water will not come in.\r\n\r\nOne or more good sized openings are left in the front of the breeding\r\nhouse for ventilation, or windows may be placed in the front which can\r\nbe used for this purpose. Good ventilation is necessary. Additional\r\nventilation is secured from the doors. If the weather is mild the doors\r\nare left partly open, if cold they are nearly closed, while when the\r\nweather is hot they are left entirely open. A good scheme is to use a\r\nsort of Dutch door so that the bottom or top half can be opened\r\nindependently. In this way the top part of the doors can be left open so\r\nas to let in the sunlight and still keep the ducks in the house or the\r\ntop may be left closed and the bottom opened so as to allow the ducks to\r\ngo in or out and still cut down the amount of ventilation. When the\r\nweather is warm the doors may be left entirely open except for a board\r\n18 inches to 2 feet wide inserted in the bottom of the door when it is\r\ndesired to keep the ducks in.\r\n\r\nShade is essential for the breeders and if not provided naturally by\r\ntrees must be supplied by means of artificial shelters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.

S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18. A good house for breeding ducks. It is 20 feet\r\ndeep, 40 feet long, 7 feet high in front and 4 feet in the rear and will\r\naccommodate 200 breeders. (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_Bedding and Cleaning the Breeding Houses._ Usually straw, meadow hay,\r\nor swale hay is used for bedding. Shavings make good material for this\r\npurpose if they do not contain too much sawdust. The principal objection\r\nto shavings is that it takes longer to bed with them. Often a few joists\r\nare laid at the back of the house on which to pile bales of straw or\r\nother bedding so that it will be kept dry and will serve as an emergency\r\nsupply available for bedding the house in stormy days. The houses should\r\nbe bedded fairly often in order to keep the floors clean and dry and so\r\nas not to allow the ducks' feet to get cold. The frequency with which\r\nbedding is necessary will depend upon the weather. In winter it may at\r\ntimes be necessary to bed every day. In May it may be necessary only\r\ntwice a week and still later in the season only once a week. In wet\r\nweather the ducks track in lots of mud and water and frequent bedding\r\nhelps to keep the eggs clean. The houses are cleaned out only once a\r\nyear and this is usually done after the ducks have stopped laying. To\r\nclean out the houses while the ducks are laying would disturb them and\r\ntend to stop their egg production.\r\n\r\n_Cleaning the Breeding Yards._ The yards should be cleaned whenever they\r\nneed it, that is, whenever they begin to get sloppy or sticky. It is a\r\nmatter of judgment to decide when this is necessary. The character of\r\nthe soil influences this, as sandy yards absorb the droppings better and\r\ndo not need cleaning as frequently as heavier soils. In the yards for\r\nthe breeding ducks, or the water yards, this will as a rule not be over\r\n2 or 3 times a season. In dry weather cleaning is accomplished by\r\nsweeping the yards with a broom. In wet weather the droppings spread\r\nover the yard and are packed down by the ducks' feet until they form a\r\nlayer of putty-like material which cannot be swept off but is scraped\r\noff by means of a hoe.\r\n\r\n_Water Yards for Breeders._ Formerly it was the consensus of opinion\r\nthat breeders needed water in which they could swim in order to keep in\r\ngood breeding condition and to give the best results in fertility of the\r\neggs. At present it is not considered necessary to have sufficient\r\nwater to permit swimming although many breeders prefer to do this and\r\nfeel that they get better results from it. However, breeding ducks have\r\nbeen and are being kept successfully in dry yards where water is\r\nsupplied to them simply in an amount sufficient to allow them to drink\r\nand to clean themselves. Where water yards are provided this should not\r\nbe on stagnant water but there should be some circulation of the water\r\nso as to keep it clean and fresh. Where the lay of the land is such that\r\nit is not possible to run all the yards down to a stream for this\r\npurpose it is sometimes possible to dig a canal or ditch from the stream\r\nto the yards so as to allow the ducks access to the water. Where the\r\nyards can extend into the water it saves a great deal of labor or\r\nconsiderable expense in equipment as it is not then necessary to provide\r\nthe ducks with drinking water by means of some artificial arrangement\r\nsuch as a concrete gutter or ditch extending through the yards or by\r\nmeans of artificial ponds.\r\n\r\nIf the water yards used freeze over in winter it is necessary to cut\r\nholes in the ice so that the ducks can get water for drinking purposes.\r\nSometimes the ducks will go into these water holes and after getting\r\ntheir plumage wet will come out and sit down in the yard and freeze fast\r\nto the ground. During such weather conditions it is necessary to make\r\nthe rounds of the yards frequently and to loosen any ducks that have\r\nfrozen fast. If they are left in that condition they are apt to\r\ninjure themselves in trying to pull free and if left too long will die.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19. Another successful type of house for breeding\r\nducks. It is 20 ft. by 40 ft. and is divided into two pens each of which\r\nwill accommodate 100 breeders. (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20. Meal time for the breeders. (_Photograph from\r\nthe Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_Feeding the Breeders._ Breeding ducks are fed twice a day, in the\r\nmorning and at night. It is usual practice to feed the breeders last in\r\nthe morning and first at night. The reason for feeding them last in the\r\nmorning is that they are usually fed in the yards rather than the house\r\nand they should be kept in until they are through laying which will be\r\nafter daylight. A good breeding ration consists of the following, the\r\nproportions being given by measure in bushels.\r\n\r\n1 bushel bran.\r\n1 bushel low-grade flour.\r\n1 bushel corn meal.\r\n1 bushel green feed.\r\n1/2 bushel either raw or cooked vegetables.\r\n1 bushel in 10 of beef scrap.\r\n1/2 bushel in 10 of cooked fish.\r\n\r\nThis ration will keep the breeding ducks in good flesh but there will be\r\nno difficulty in their getting too fat. It is also a good laying ration\r\nand will promote good egg production. The vegetables used in this ration\r\nusually consist of sugar beets, cow beets, potatoes, etc. However, if\r\npotatoes are used the amount of flour in the ration should be reduced a\r\nlittle so as not to make the ration too heavy. Beets, when used, are fed\r\nraw cut up and mixed in the feed. Small potatoes, boiled and mixed in\r\nthe feed are more valuable as they have a greater food value than beets.\r\nSome duck growers feed fish entirely, using no beef scrap. This is done\r\nwhere a plentiful supply of fish can be secured by going out into the\r\nbay after them. However, this is not very good practice for a sufficient\r\nsupply of fish may not always be available and the ducks are so fond of\r\nthe fish that they will not eat well the beef scrap used as a substitute\r\nfor the fish, until they have become used to it. Fish is prepared for\r\nfeeding by boiling it thoroughly in a feed cooker.\r\n\r\nThe available land on the plant is used to grow a supply of green feed.\r\nRye is used for this purpose early in the spring as soon as it is high\r\nenough to mow. It is mowed the first time when it is like a lawn. At\r\nthis stage it does not have to be cut up. Oats are used in the same way.\r\nDuring the summer fodder corn is used. This is the poorest crop for the\r\npurpose but is as a rule the only one available at that time. Rape is\r\nsowed in August and its use begun about the time of the first frost and\r\nkept up until the hard freezes come or until it is buried under the\r\nsnow. Creek grass which is secured from the fresh water streams on Long\r\nIsland by going out in a flat bottom boat and raking it off the creek\r\nbottom with a wooden rake, is very much relished by the ducks and is\r\nused whenever it is available. However, the supply of this material is\r\nnot as plentiful as it was formerly and it is rather hard to get. When\r\nit is available it can be used either in winter or summer.\r\n\r\nGood field clover cut up and boiled with the potatoes or with the fish\r\nmakes a good green feed. All of these green materials for use in the\r\nration, unless they are already in short lengths, are cut up by means of\r\na power feed cutter before they are mixed in the mash. When no other\r\nform of green feed is available ground alfalfa is used but only half as\r\nmuch of this material is mixed with the ration as is used of any of the\r\nother kinds of green feed. Wherever possible the various duck yards\r\nshould be used to grow a crop of green stuff such as oats or rye as this\r\nnot only helps out on the supply of green feed but also helps to sweeten\r\nthe soil. The growing of a crop on the heavier types of soil used for\r\nducks is especially important as such soils are more likely to become\r\ncontaminated from the droppings.\r\n\r\nThe ration for the ducks is mixed up in a power feed mixer which works\r\nmuch on the principle of a power dough mixer. In fact, dough mixers are\r\nused on some plants. In mixing the feed enough water should be added to\r\nbring the material to a consistency where it will hold together when\r\nsqueezed in the hand. In fact, the consistency should be between crumbly\r\nand sticky, but should never be sloppy. The feed is dumped from the\r\nmixer into a low horse drawn wagon and driven around to the various\r\nyards where it is shoveled off on to the feed troughs or trays. On some\r\nlarge duck plants a track is provided which runs over the yards and over\r\nthis a car loaded with feed is pushed and the feed shoveled into the\r\nfeed trays.\r\n\r\nThe breeders should be fed in the same place. If feeding is begun in the\r\nhouse this practice should be continued. If feeding is begun in the\r\nyards it should be continued there. To change disturbs the ducks and\r\ninterferes with their egg production.\r\n\r\nCoarse ground oyster shell about as large as corn should be kept before\r\nthe breeders all the time in boxes where they can help themselves. A\r\nflock of 700 or 800 breeders will eat upwards of 200 pounds a week of\r\nthis material. Unless sand is available in the yards where they can get\r\nit, ducks should also have access to a supply of good sharp creek sand\r\nbut when kept in sand yards no other form of grit need be furnished.\r\n\r\nThe usual method of feeding is to utilize flat troughs on which the feed\r\nis shoveled. Only as much feed should be given at the regular feeding\r\ntime as the ducks will eat up clean. This makes it necessary to watch\r\nthe feeding carefully and to regulate the amount accordingly. It is good\r\npractice to gather up any feed that is left by the ducks so that it will\r\nnot lie there to sour and spoil as such feed is bad for the birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nEgg Production\r\n\r\nThe average egg production of Pekin ducks kept under commercial farm\r\nconditions will run from 80 to 125 eggs per head for the season. This\r\nwill vary somewhat from year to year and also with the management and\r\nfeed given the ducks. The laying begins to a small extent about December\r\n1 and gradually increases until the ducks are laying freely in February.\r\nAs the hot weather of summer begins to come on the laying drops off\r\nuntil about July 1 and after this not enough eggs are produced as a rule\r\nto pay to hold the breeding ducks longer. Often many ducks will stop\r\nlaying considerably before this, especially those which have started\r\nlaying early and it may not pay to keep such pens later than May. Laying\r\ntakes place early in the morning and practically all the eggs are laid\r\nsoon after daylight. It is for this reason that the ducks are usually\r\nshut up at night so that all the eggs laid will be secured as some of\r\nthem would otherwise be lost by their being laid around in the yard or\r\nin the water. In the spring the ducks can be let out about 6 a. m., as\r\nthe laying will be pretty well over by that time, but in winter they\r\nmust be kept shut up later in order to secure all the eggs. After the\r\nducks start laying in the spring they are very regular and continuous\r\nlayers and will miss fewer days than most hens.\r\n\r\nAfter the breeding ducks are first put in the breeding pens and shut in\r\nthe houses at night it is common practice to use electric lights for the\r\nfirst 2 or 3 weeks in order to keep them from stampeding as ducks in\r\nstrange surroundings are quite nervous and are quite likely to stampede\r\nand to run over one another thus causing cripples. Electric lights have\r\nalso been used to some extent during the late fall and winter for the\r\npurpose of inducing egg production earlier than the natural season. As a\r\nrule the ducks can be started to laying about 4 weeks after turning on\r\nthe lights but the average production under this system is not likely to\r\nrun more than 60 eggs for the season as so handled they moult quite\r\nearly in the spring. A single 25 watt light is sufficient for a house or\r\npen 16 x 24 feet and the lights are left turned on all night.\r\n\r\nThe object in feeding and caring for the breeding ducks is to keep them\r\nfrom moulting and to keep them laying as long as possible. It must be\r\nremembered that any radical change in feed or manner of feeding,\r\nshutting them up too closely, change of temperature, or other disturbing\r\nconditions are likely to cause moulting and to check egg production. Any\r\nchange in feed must be made carefully and gradually, not suddenly. It\r\nmust also be remembered that ducks are excitable birds and must be\r\nhandled and driven carefully so as to disturb them as little as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTime of Marketing Breeders\r\n\r\nThe breeders should be turned off to market whenever their egg\r\nproduction drops off so decidedly that it no longer pays to hold them.\r\nIn most cases this will be about the 1st of July but it may range\r\nconsiderably earlier than this, especially with pens of ducks that have\r\nstarted laying early. When the ducks finish laying their eggs they begin\r\nto moult and it is at this time that they should be marketed. If\r\nmarketing is delayed, the ducks will lose condition as the moulting\r\nprogresses and will therefore be held at a loss.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiseases and Pests\r\n\r\n_Disease._ Old ducks, that is, mature ducks, are practically free from\r\ndisease. Of course, there will be a certain amount of loss in the\r\nbreeding stock from various causes but this should not run for the\r\nentire season more than 10% of the flock. Ducks do not become egg bound,\r\nbut sometimes, especially during heavy laying, they become ruptured.\r\n\r\n_Insect Pests._ Ducks are remarkably free from lice and other insect\r\npests and those which they do have do not trouble them much. It is\r\nunnecessary therefore to take any precautions in the way of treating the\r\nducks to keep them free of insects.\r\n\r\n_Dogs._ Occasionally trouble may be experienced from dogs. If these\r\nanimals get into the yards with the breeders or the fattening ducks,\r\nthey may kill a good many and in addition will seriously injure the rest\r\nby chasing them and by the fright which the ducks are given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCommercial Duck Farming--Incubation\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pekin duck is essentially a non-broody breed. It, therefore, becomes\r\nnecessary to resort to incubators for the purpose of hatching the eggs.\r\nOccasional ducks will sit if allowed to do so but it is not the practice\r\non commercial duck farms to allow them to sit and hatch their young. No\r\nspecial means are taken to break them of broodiness other than not to\r\nallow them eggs to sit on.\r\n\r\n_Kinds of Incubators Used._ Both the smaller kerosene lamp heated\r\nincubators and the large or mammoth hot water heated incubators are used\r\nfor hatching duck eggs. At the present time the mammoth hot water\r\nmachines are those which are in principal use due largely to the\r\nlessened labor required to operate them.\r\n\r\n_Incubator Cellar._ It is necessary to provide some room in which the\r\nincubators can be installed and operated. This may take the form of a\r\ncellar, or the incubators may be operated in rooms above the ground.\r\nMany of the incubator cellars on duck farms are only partially under\r\nground and not a few of them are built entirely out of ground. The\r\nparticular size and shape of the cellar or incubator room will, of\r\ncourse, depend upon the number of incubators to be installed and upon\r\ntheir make and shape. Usually these buildings are constructed with\r\nrather thick walls so that the temperature of the room will fluctuate\r\nless with changes in outside temperature. Provision is also necessary by\r\nmeans of windows or other ventilating devices to provide for good\r\nventilation in the room. The cellars are usually constructed with cement\r\nfloors as moisture is used freely and wooden floors would rot out\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n_Incubator Capacity Required._ The aim on commercial duck farms is to\r\nhatch all of the eggs produced which are suitable for the purpose.\r\nPractically no eggs are sold except the cracked eggs or those which\r\nwould not give good results in the incubator such as too large or too\r\nsmall eggs. Occasionally, of course, there will be sales of duck eggs in\r\ncomparatively large lots for incubation purposes where someone is\r\nstarting a duck farm. Occasionally also duck farmers buy from each other\r\na few eggs for incubation in order to secure new blood. On the whole,\r\nhowever, practically all of the eggs laid are incubated and it is\r\nnecessary to have an incubator capacity sufficient to take care of the\r\neggs as they are produced during the flush season.\r\n\r\nSince the egg production at this time will run around about 80% and\r\nsince the period of incubation is 28 days and a couple more days must be\r\nallowed to take the ducklings out of the machines and to clean up the\r\nmachines, it is necessary to figure on 30 days between hatches. To take\r\ncare of the flush production at this time there would be required an\r\nincubator capacity of from 20 to 25 eggs per head of breeding ducks. The\r\nlatter figure is a safer estimate than the former. Of course, eggs\r\nsufficient to fill the entire incubator capacity are not put in the\r\nmachines at any one time but different lots are put in as soon as a\r\nsufficient number is obtained to make it worth while. There will be,\r\ntherefore, eggs in various stages of incubation in different sections of\r\nthe machines at the same time. While Pekin duck eggs will run about 1/2\r\nheavier in weight than hens' eggs they do not take up a proportionately\r\ngreater amount of space in the incubator. An incubator tray will\r\naccommodate about 5/6 as many Pekin duck eggs as it will hens' eggs.\r\n\r\n_Age of Hatching Eggs._ Duck eggs should be set as often as enough are\r\nsecured to fill one or more trays in the incubator or enough to produce\r\na sufficient number of ducklings to utilize brooding space to advantage.\r\nSince duck eggs deteriorate more rapidly than hens' eggs they cannot be\r\nkept so long before they are set. It is best not to save them for longer\r\nthan one week. During the season of flush production it is not, of\r\ncourse, necessary to save them that long since enough eggs will be\r\nsecured to set each day if desired. The usual practice at this time is\r\nto set twice a week. During the early part of the season when the\r\nproduction of eggs is low and the temperature cool the eggs are often\r\nsaved for as long a period as two weeks without noticeably bad results.\r\n\r\n_Care of Hatching Eggs._ Eggs for hatching should be kept in a cool\r\nplace. Any place suitable for keeping hens' eggs for hatching is a\r\nsuitable place for duck eggs. The temperature should be from 50 deg. to 70 deg.\r\nFahrenheit. Where the eggs are not kept longer than one week, it is not\r\nnecessary to turn them, especially if they are kept on end. If kept\r\nlonger than this it is safer to turn them once a day or once in two\r\ndays, handling them carefully so as not to crack any or to injure their\r\nhatching qualities.\r\n\r\n_Selecting the Eggs for Hatching._ Medium sized eggs are preferred for\r\nthis purpose. Therefore, the extremely large eggs and the very small\r\nones are thrown out. Rough shelled eggs or eggs with crooked or deformed\r\nshells are likewise thrown out since they are not likely to hatch well.\r\nEggs that are badly soiled so that they cannot be tested easily are\r\nwashed but the clean eggs are not. All the eggs intended for incubation\r\npurposes are sounded by striking them gently against one another in\r\norder to detect and remove the cracked eggs. No selection is made on the\r\nbasis of color. The eggs may be white, creamy white or a blue, or bluish\r\ngreen in color. At the present time a considerably less proportion of\r\nthe eggs show a blue tint than formerly. As the egg laying season\r\nadvances the eggs laid by the ducks tend to get a little larger.\r\n\r\n_Temperature._ Up to the time of testing, that is, about the fifth day,\r\nthe incubator is run at a temperature of from 101 to 102 degrees. After\r\nthe fifth day the temperature is kept as near 103 as possible. The most\r\nsensitive period for a duck egg is during the first 3 or 4 days of\r\nincubation. If they are allowed to get too warm during this time the\r\ngerm may be killed while if the temperature is too low, development will\r\nbe retarded.\r\n\r\n_Position of the Thermometer._ In figuring on the proper temperature at\r\nwhich to run the incubator, the thermometer should be so placed that the\r\nbulb is on a level with the top of the eggs, preferably touching a\r\nfertile egg. If the thermometer bulb rests on an infertile egg the\r\ntemperature recorded will be lower than the actual temperature of\r\nfertile eggs in the later stages of incubation, due to the animal heat\r\nof the developing embryos, with the result that the machine would be\r\noperated at too high a temperature.\r\n\r\n_Testing._ It is common practice to make only one complete test. This is\r\ndone on the evening of the fifth day. Testing may be done by means of an\r\nordinary candling device such as is used with hens' eggs, each egg being\r\nexamined separately. To save time a piece of apparatus may be used which\r\nis simple in construction and which simplifies the process of candling\r\nconsiderably. This may be termed a testing table. It consists of a\r\ntable the same width as an incubator tray and longer than the tray. In\r\nthe table there is an opening the size of a row of eggs and beneath this\r\nare placed several electric light bulbs with reflectors back of them so\r\nas to throw the light up through the eggs. By sliding the tray along the\r\ntable each row of eggs is brought over the lights and their condition\r\ncan be quickly noted. At this test all the infertile eggs are taken out\r\nas well as any eggs in which the germs have died. The infertile eggs\r\nafter a careful retest are then packed in cases and sent to market where\r\nthey are usually sold to bakers as tested eggs. While no second test is\r\nmade of the eggs left in the machines the experienced incubator operator\r\nis constantly on the watch for and is constantly removing any eggs which\r\ndie at a later time. To the experienced eye the color of the egg\r\nindicates that it has died as it takes on a sort of pinkish or darkish\r\ntint. Duck eggs after they die will spoil very quickly and must be\r\nremoved promptly as the odor which they throw off is very strong and\r\nwill prove harmful to the other eggs. The inexperienced operator can\r\nreadily locate dead eggs by smelling over the tray.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21. Interior of house for breeding ducks. Notice the\r\nheavy bedding and the feeding track. (_Photograph from the Bureau of\r\nAnimal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22. Incubator cellar on large duck plant. Trays of\r\neggs set out to turn and cool. (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_Turning the Eggs._ The eggs are neither turned, cooled nor otherwise\r\ndisturbed after they are put in the incubator until after they are\r\ntested on the fifth day. From this time on they are turned twice a day,\r\nmorning and night, until they begin to pip.\r\n\r\n_Cooling the Eggs._ There is a considerable difference in the practice\r\nof incubator operators with regard to cooling. No cooling should be done\r\nuntil after the first test. After this some incubator men cool the eggs\r\nby dropping the doors of the machine. Others take the trays of eggs out\r\nand put them on top of the machine. Cooling is usually done once a day.\r\nThe amount of cooling which the eggs require seems to vary greatly and\r\nhere again the judgment of the operator comes into play. About the best\r\ngeneral rule which can be given is that the eggs should be cooled until\r\nthey do not feel warm to the face but they should never be cooled to the\r\nextent that they feel cold to the face or hands. The length of time to\r\nbring this about varies with the age of the eggs and the temperature of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n_Moisture._ A good deal of moisture is used in incubating duck eggs. It\r\nis usual to begin to spray the eggs with water the next day after\r\ntesting. However, this may vary anywhere from the sixth to the tenth\r\nday. They are sprayed quite thoroughly, some men using water enough so\r\nthat it runs out of the bottom of the machine. No particular care is\r\ntaken to see that the water used is warm. Ordinary water just as it\r\ncomes from the pipes is commonly used and is applied by means of a spray\r\nnozzle attached to a hose. However, extremely cold water should not be\r\nused for this purpose. This spraying is done once or twice a day as the\r\noperator may think necessary until the eggs begin to hatch. In many\r\ncases even then if the ducklings seem to be drying too fast after they\r\ncome out of the shell, or to be having difficulty to get out it is well\r\nto open the machines and wet the eggs down thoroughly.\r\n\r\n_Fertility._ The fertility varies with the season that is, with the\r\nweather. At the beginning of the laying season when the weather is cold\r\nthe fertility usually runs rather low. This is likewise true at the end\r\nof the laying season when the heat of summer sets in. During the\r\ninterval between these two times of low fertility there will usually be\r\none or more periods during which the fertility will go down and then\r\ncome back again. This seems to occur even though the weather remains\r\nabout the same and though there is no change in the method of feeding.\r\nFertility may be considered to be good when it runs about 85%. When the\r\nfertility is running poor the hatching of the eggs left in the machines\r\nafter testing will usually be poor also.\r\n\r\n_Hatching._ It takes longer as a rule from the time that the ducklings\r\npip the eggs until they hatch than it does with chicks. To retain the\r\nmoisture which is so necessary during hatching, the machines are usually\r\nshut tightly and are not opened until the hatching is pretty well\r\ncompleted unless it becomes necessary to add more moisture as indicated\r\nabove. The little ducklings should be left in the incubator until the\r\nhatching is over and they are thoroughly dried off. As soon as the\r\nhatching is completed, the ventilators in the machines are opened to\r\nhasten the drying process. If the ducklings open their bills and pant\r\nit is an indication that they are not getting enough ventilation and\r\nthis should be supplied by fastening the machine door open a little way.\r\nIf the ducks are not ready to be taken out of the machines by noon or\r\nsoon after, it is best to leave them until the next morning before\r\nremoving them to the brooder house. In the meantime, however, the old\r\neggs and shells and other refuse should be taken out. Usually the hatch\r\nis completed in time so that the ducklings can be removed to the brooder\r\nhouse on the afternoon of the 28th day. As a rule the earlier the hatch\r\nis completed the better are the ducklings.\r\n\r\nFigures secured on results in hatching for the entire season on Long\r\nIsland duck farms indicate that as a whole the duck raisers will not\r\naverage much over 40% hatch of all eggs set. Some hatches may run as\r\nhigh as 60% or even more and in some seasons the average percentage will\r\nrun higher than 40. Some especially skilled operators may also secure\r\nconsiderably better average results than this. It is quite a common\r\npractice on the part of duck farmers to pay their incubator man a bonus\r\non all ducklings over 40% hatched during the season. This bonus may\r\nrange anywhere from $1 to $5 per thousand ducklings. Such an arrangement\r\nserves to give the incubator man a greater incentive to give the\r\nmachines good attention and to secure just the best results of which he\r\nis capable.\r\n\r\n_Selling Baby Ducks._ Within the last two or three years there has\r\nsprung into existence a small but increasing trade in baby ducks. They\r\nare handled and shipped about the same as baby chicks. Baby ducks are\r\nready for shipment as soon as they are thoroughly dry, usually about 12\r\nhours after the hatch starts to come off. They are neither fed nor\r\nwatered before shipment and are packed in cardboard boxes used in\r\nshipping baby chicks. As a rule the shipping boxes will accommodate\r\nabout half the number of ducklings that they will chicks. Of course the\r\noutside temperature very largely governs the matter of the number to a\r\ncompartment. In warm summer weather, a two compartment box intended for\r\n50 chicks will accommodate 26 ducklings if well ventilated at the sides\r\nand top. They are shipped by parcel post and can be sent anywhere within\r\na radius of one thousand miles if the trip does not require more than 36\r\nhours. For best results the ducklings should not be allowed to go much\r\nbeyond this length of time before they are fed. On receipt they should\r\nbe placed immediately in a brooder already prepared for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nCommercial Duck Farming--Brooding and Rearing the Young Stock\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung ducks are easier to brood than chicks. They seem to learn more\r\nquickly where the source of heat is and they are less likely to cause\r\ntrouble from crowding. They are also less subject to disease.\r\n\r\n_Removing the Newly Hatched Ducklings to the Brooder House._ The\r\nducklings should be left in the incubator until they are thoroughly\r\ndried off. Usually they will be dried so that they can be moved on the\r\nafternoon of the 28th day of incubation. If, however, they are not ready\r\nearly in the afternoon it is best to leave them in the machine until the\r\nnext morning. In moving the ducklings, place them in boxes, baskets or\r\nother suitable carriers and cover them with burlap or cloth to avoid any\r\ndanger of the ducklings becoming chilled.\r\n\r\n_Brooder Houses Repaired._ There are many different types and styles of\r\nbrooder houses which are used with success. For this reason only one\r\ntype of each class of brooder house needed is described in detail. These\r\nparticular houses have been in successful use for a considerable period\r\nof time and are given because they embody all the necessary requisites\r\nfor such houses and at the same time utilize the space to good advantage\r\nand are economical in construction.\r\n\r\nIn general there are required three different brooder houses. The first\r\nof these requires sufficient heating capacity so that the temperature of\r\nthe house itself can be maintained at 65 to 70 degrees even in the cold\r\nweather of winter or early spring. In addition, hovers are required in\r\nthis house under which a temperature can be maintained from 80 to 90\r\ndegrees. For convenience this house will be spoken of as brooder house\r\nNo. 1. A second brooder house which can be called brooder house No. 2\r\nwill be required which is equipped with heating apparatus so that the\r\ntemperature can be run up to 60 degrees when required. The third brooder\r\nhouse known as brooder house No. 3 is a cold brooder house or one\r\nwithout artificial heat. It furnishes shelter for the young ducks where\r\nthey can be driven in at night and during the day in cold weather. As\r\nthe ducklings pass out of the brooder house No. 3 they are housed in\r\nsheds or shelters with yards which usually extend into the water but\r\nwhich may not do so in all cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrooder House No. 1\r\n\r\nThe length of this house determines its capacity, the required amount of\r\nwhich will depend upon the output of any particular plant. There should\r\nbe brooder capacity in this house sufficient to care for approximately\r\n1/4 of the total output for the year at one time.\r\n\r\n_Construction of House._ A suitable house which has been in practical\r\nuse for some time consists of one 20 feet wide and running east and west\r\nwith windows in the south or front side. If the location were right such\r\na house could be run north and south to good advantage and should then\r\nhave windows on each side so as to let in the sunlight from both\r\ndirections. The front wall of this house is 7 feet high, the back wall 4\r\nfeet. The ridge of the house is about 2 feet in front of the center, the\r\nfront slope of the roof having an eight inch pitch while the back slope\r\nhas a 6 inch pitch. The roof rafters are 2 x 4's placed every two feet.\r\nThe studs and plates are likewise 2 x 4. The walls are made of matched\r\nmaterial. The roof is constructed of 1 x 2 inch strips placed every 4\r\ninches and these covered with shingles. Tie beams every 8 feet extend\r\nfrom front to rear plates. This particular brooder house is not ceiled\r\nbut a good tight ceiling 8 feet above the walk or runway would make it\r\neasier to keep the house clean and would also render it somewhat easier\r\nin cold weather to maintain the temperature desired. The house is built\r\non a concrete wall or foundation and a dirt floor is used but the dirt\r\nmust be filled in well above the level of the ground outside so that\r\nthere is no danger of water coming into the house or the floors becoming\r\ndamp or sloppy. Windows are placed in the front wall, one to each pen.\r\nIn every other pen there is a small door in the back of the house to\r\nfacilitate cleaning out the pens. A window can be substituted for this\r\ndoor to good advantage as it makes the house lighter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23. Interior of No. 1 brooder house showing walk and\r\nhover combined in the middle of the house and pens on each side.\r\n(_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_Heating Apparatus._ Heat is furnished by means of a coal burning stove\r\nwhich heats water and causes it to circulate through pipes run the\r\nlength of the house. The heater must always be placed in the windward\r\nend of the building as otherwise it is hard to get the heat down to the\r\nother end as the wind tends to drive it back. The hot water pipes are\r\ncarried down the center of the house and the return pipes are located in\r\nthe same place. A low partition is run lengthwise of the house dividing\r\nthe pipes and thus forming double pens, half extending from the center\r\nto the front and half from the center to the rear of the house. The\r\npipes and the partition between them is covered over with boards making\r\na 4 foot walk or runway directly over the pipes, which comes into most\r\nconvenient use as a place to convey, by means of a wheelbarrow, feed or\r\nother material needed in the house, and as a convenient place from which\r\nto care for the ducklings in the pens on each side. This board covering\r\nover the pipes also serves to hold the heat and thus forms hovers.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable to partition off the first third of the house, that is,\r\nthe portion in which the heater is located, with a solid partition. Then\r\nby having suitable valves in the pipes, the heat can be cut off from\r\nthe rest of the house and only the smaller partitioned off end used as a\r\nseparate and independent section of the brooder. This is especially\r\nuseful when only a small number of ducklings are being hatched early in\r\nthe spring when the weather is cold and it may be difficult to heat the\r\nwhole building properly. It is also economical in fuel under such\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the number of ducklings hatched during the cold\r\nweather is so large that all or nearly all of the house capacity is\r\nneeded to care for them, it will usually pay to install an additional\r\nheater, the pipes from which can be run along the rear wall of the\r\nbuilding, in order to keep up a proper house temperature when the\r\nweather is severe.\r\n\r\n_Pens._ Having the hovers in the center of the house, makes it possible\r\nto have double sets of pens, one running from the center to the front\r\nwall and the other from the center to the rear wall. The pens are\r\ndivided off by means of partitions made of one foot boards. These are\r\nhigh enough to confine the ducklings to their own pen and at the same\r\ntime are easy to step over. In a house of this width, 20 feet, with 4\r\nfeet in the center taken up by the double hovers or walk, each pen is 8\r\nfeet long in the clear or 10 feet to the partition under the hover. The\r\npens in the first third of the house are made 5 feet wide, in the next\r\nthird 6 feet and in the last third 7 feet wide. When the ducklings are\r\nfirst brought from the incubator cellar they are placed in the pens\r\nnearest the heater as the temperature will run somewhat higher there\r\nthan in the portions of the house more remote from the heater. These 5 x\r\n10 foot pens will accommodate 125 baby ducklings although better results\r\nwill be obtained by placing only 100 in a pen if sufficient room is\r\navailable. Some duck growers use boards which can be slipped into slots\r\nmade of cleats nailed to the pen partitions at different distances from\r\nthe hover and which serve to confine the baby ducklings close to the\r\nhover for the first few days or until they learn to go under the hover\r\nto get warm.\r\n\r\nAs additional ducklings are hatched later and brought to the brooder\r\nhouse, the ducklings already there are moved along the necessary number\r\nof pens in order to accommodate the new-comers in the pens nearest the\r\nheater. For this purpose, a small door is made in each partition next\r\nthe outside wall of the house through which the ducklings can be driven.\r\nA broom is a handy implement to use in driving the ducklings as they can\r\nbe pushed along in front of it. It is best to drive the ducklings just\r\nafter they have been fed as they are not so nervous and afraid at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe increased width of the pens in the second and third portions of the\r\nhouse is for the purpose of taking care of the growth of the ducklings\r\nas they are moved along the house. Pens of the same width as those in\r\nwhich they were started become too crowded as the ducklings increase in\r\nsize.\r\n\r\n_Equipment of the Pen._ The equipment of the pens is quite simple. Water\r\nis piped through the house along both walls so that it is available to\r\neach pen. A spigot is provided in each pen and under this is placed the\r\ndrinking dish, which consists of a round metal pan about a foot in\r\ndiameter and 3 or 4 inches deep. A square pan should never be used as\r\nthe ducklings are apt to get their bills caught in the corners. One\r\nquarter inch mesh wire netting is bent in a circle and placed in the\r\ndrinking dish as a guard to keep the ducklings from getting into the\r\npan. This guard should be made of such size that there is a space\r\nbetween the wire and the edge of the dish of about 1-1/2 inches all around.\r\nThis guard should be about 8 inches high. The water pan itself is set\r\nupon a wire covered frame about 18 inches square under which is dug a\r\npit 4 or 5 inches deep to drain away any water which the ducklings slop\r\nout of the pan. Such an arrangement keeps the pens from becoming sloppy\r\nand damp.\r\n\r\nEach pen must also have a flat metal dish on which to place the feed for\r\nthe little ducks. Metal pans are better than wooden feeding trays as\r\nthey are easier to keep clean.\r\n\r\nIn each pen is provided a small hopper filled with fine sharp creek sand\r\nto which the ducklings have access at all times. Some duck growers\r\nprefer to mix the sand in the feed rather than to provide it in hoppers.\r\nAfter the ducklings are allowed to run in the yards, sand need not be\r\nfurnished if the yards are sand as the ducklings will help\r\nthemselves. If the land in the yards is not sand, however, it is\r\nnecessary to continue to furnish this material.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24. Watering arrangement in the brooder pens for\r\nyoung ducklings. (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25. Another type of No. 1 brooder house. Here the\r\nhovers are along the back of the house and the work is done from an\r\nalleyway along the front. The box with handles on top of the hover is\r\nused in carrying the newly hatched ducklings from the incubator cellar\r\nto the brooder house. (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry,\r\nU. S. Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_Grading and Sorting the Ducklings._ As the ducklings are moved from pen\r\nto pen through this house as well as the other houses, they are\r\nconstantly graded for size and thriftiness, the smaller, less thrifty\r\nindividuals being left with younger lots. Some ducklings do not grow as\r\nquickly as others, and these if left with ducklings larger than\r\nthemselves will not get their share of the feed and will not do as well.\r\nIn this connection it should be noted that when young ducks are not\r\nfairly clean it is a good indication that they are not doing as well as\r\nthey should.\r\n\r\n_Cleaning and Bedding the Pens._ Careful attention must be given to\r\nkeeping the pens and the ducklings themselves clean if they are to do\r\nwell. Therefore the pens must be cleaned out as often as may be\r\nnecessary to accomplish this purpose. The judgment of the brooder man\r\nmust decide how often this is necessary but it will be at least once a\r\nweek. When cleaning the pens the old bedding is thrown out from the\r\nfront pens through the windows and from the back pens through the door\r\nprovided in the rear wall for this purpose. Bedding the pens must be\r\ndone more frequently, usually about every other day. Fresh bedding will\r\nhelp to absorb the droppings and will keep the pens from becoming sloppy\r\nor sticky. For bedding, straw, meadow hay, swale hay or any other\r\nsuitable material available should be utilized.\r\n\r\n_Ventilation._ Plenty of ventilation is required in the brooder house in\r\norder to take out the ammonia odor which arises from the droppings.\r\nProperly managed, the doors and windows provide sufficient means of\r\nventilation but some duck growers prefer to have roof ventilators in\r\naddition.\r\n\r\n_Other Types of Brooder Houses._ Many other types of brooder houses are\r\nused, some of them being shed roof construction and many of them being\r\nbuilt narrower than this house, that is to say, 14, 16 or 18 feet wide\r\nwith an alleyway along the front or rear side of the house from which\r\nthe work is done. The hovers are placed at the back of the pens when the\r\nalley-way is in the front, otherwise, they are placed next to the\r\nalley-way. The disadvantages of these houses are that only single pens\r\nare provided and that valuable brooding space is used up by the\r\nalley-way. The advantages of the house described above lie in the fact\r\nthat the hovers are in the center of the house with the pens on each\r\nside of this, thus doubling the capacity, and that by making use of a\r\nwalk over the hover pipe no room is wasted in an alley-way. Having pens\r\non each side also lessens the labor of taking care of the ducklings to\r\nsome extent as the arrangement is more compact.\r\n\r\n\r\nLength of Time in Brooder\r\n\r\n_In House No. 1._ As a rule the ducklings are kept in the No. 1 house\r\nuntil they are from 2 to 3 weeks old, this of course depending somewhat\r\nupon the time of year and the weather and also upon the number of\r\nducklings for which accommodations must be provided at any particular\r\ntime. As the ducks are moved down through the house and eventually reach\r\nthe last pens they are taken from this house and placed in brooder house\r\nNo. 2.\r\n\r\n_Brooder House No. 2._ This is a heated house like brooder house No. 1\r\nbut in which it is not necessary to maintain so high a temperature.\r\nSufficient heating apparatus should be installed to make it possible to\r\nmaintain the temperature at 60 degrees if this becomes necessary in the\r\nearly spring.\r\n\r\nThe particular brooder house described is 14 feet wide and has a shed\r\nroof. It is provided with a window in the front of each pen. No openings\r\nare required along the back since this is not a double pen house. The\r\nspace in such a house could undoubtedly be used to better advantage if\r\nit were constructed as wide as the No. 1 house and the hot water pipes\r\nand walk put through the middle of the house so as to provide double\r\npens. In this house the hot water pipes are run along the rear of the\r\npens, and while hovers are not really necessary, a walk is constructed\r\nover the pipes in order to save space and provide a convenient place\r\nfrom which to do the work, and this forms hovers.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily after May 1 no heat is needed in the No. 2 house. The pens in\r\nthis house are 12 feet wide and they are equipped with feeding and\r\nwatering arrangements as in brooder house No. 1. As the ducklings are\r\nmoved to this house from the No. 1 house from 150 to 200 are placed in\r\neach pen. They are moved through the house from pen to pen in the same\r\nmanner as in the No. 1 house to make way for new arrivals. As a rule\r\nthey stay in this house about two weeks depending somewhat on the\r\nweather and upon the number of ducklings being brooded. Yards are used\r\nin connection with this house which are the same width as the pens and\r\n50 feet in length. As in the No. 1 house the pens in this house should\r\nbe cleaned at least once a week and they should be bedded with straw or\r\nother bedding material every other day. As soon as the ducks have been\r\nmoved through this No. 2 house they are put in brooder house No. 3.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26. Brooder house No. 2 and yards. The trees furnish\r\nfine shade for the growing ducklings. (_Photograph from the Bureau of\r\nAnimal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\nBrooder House No. 3\r\n\r\nThis is a shed roof house 16 feet wide equipped with single pens. No\r\nheat is required in this house. Yards of the same width as the pens and\r\n50 feet deep are used. Usually the ducks are fed outside the house from\r\na wagon driven along a roadway just in front of the yards.\r\n\r\nThe pens are 16 feet wide and the same number of ducks is used in them\r\nas in the No. 2 house. As a rule the ducks stay in this house about 2\r\nweeks and are then moved to the duck pens or shelters with the larger\r\nyards which may or may not have water. From this point on the ducks are\r\ntermed yard ducks.\r\n\r\nIn all three of the brooder houses the young ducks are supplied with\r\ntheir drinking water from pipes through the houses. They are not given\r\naccess to water until they are moved to the yards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27. Brooder house No. 3. At the time this picture\r\nwas taken there were no ducklings in the house and advantage was taken\r\nof this fact to give it a good cleaning by throwing out the bedding and\r\ndroppings, which will be hauled away and spread on cropped land.\r\n(_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28. Long brooder house and yards with feeding track.\r\n(_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S.

(_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal Industry,\r\nU. S. Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31. Interior of a cold brooder house. The low\r\npartitions can easily be stepped over. (_Photograph from the Bureau of\r\nAnimal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nYard Accommodations for Ducklings\r\n\r\nAs the ducklings get to be 8 weeks old they can stand ordinary weather\r\nconditions and it is not absolutely necessary to have houses for them.\r\nHowever, it is common and good practice to provide shelter where they\r\ncan be housed at night and can take refuge from storms. A suitable house\r\nfor this purpose consists of a building 16 x 24 feet divided into two\r\nparts with 200 ducklings to a side. This house is 5 feet high in front\r\nand 3-1/2 feet in back. It is set on posts with a baseboard around it to\r\nmake it tight. It can be constructed of matched stuff or unmatched stuff\r\ncovered with paper. The front is left open but curtains are placed on\r\nthe front which can be used to close the openings so as to keep out the\r\nsnow. These are used only in the winter. When the ducklings are first\r\nstarted in these sheds they are shut in when desired by means of wire\r\npanels fitted into the lower part of the open front. The ducklings are\r\nleft in these yards and fed there until they are ready for market.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32. Eat, drink and grow fat for tomorrow they die.\r\nFattening or yard ducks with fattening house or shelter used.\r\n(_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_Shade._ Shade is important for the ducklings as soon as the sun gets\r\nhot. Exposure to the sun without shade will cause quite a heavy loss in\r\nducklings. If natural shade is not furnished by trees, some artificial\r\nmeans must be adopted to supply the shade. This may take the form of\r\nshelters or low frames covered with boards, brush or burlap.\r\n\r\n_Feeding._ The first feed and water is given as soon as the ducks are\r\nplaced in the No. 1 brooder house or when 24 to 36 hours old. They are\r\nfed 3 times a day, in the morning about 6 a. m., at noon, and at night\r\nabout 4:30 or 5 o'clock. The time of feeding should be regular, and\r\nfairly early in the morning but not any earlier in the afternoon than\r\none can help so that the time between the evening and the morning feed\r\nwill not be too long. Some growers prefer to feed 4 or 5 times daily for\r\nthe first week or two. The birds are fed as much as they will clean up\r\nat each feeding and if any feed is left it should be gathered up so that\r\nit will not sour and cause digestive troubles.\r\n\r\nThe first feed consists of the following:--One measure corn meal, one\r\nmeasure bran, one measure ground crackers, stale bread or shredded wheat\r\nwaste, one measure in 10 of beef scrap or fish, one measure in 6 of\r\ncreek grass or other very fine green stuff. Green rye or oats should\r\nnever be used for this purpose after it becomes jointed. If the feed is\r\nmixed up with cold water about -1/2 measure of low-grade wheat flour should\r\nbe used to cause it to stick together. If hot water is used in the\r\nmixing this is not needed.\r\n\r\nSand must be fed either by mixing it in to the extent of about 3% of the\r\nration or the sand can be fed separately in hoppers as previously\r\ndescribed. This same mixture may be fed in the No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3\r\nbrooder houses, or in other words, until ducklings go to the yards, or\r\nration No. 2 given below may be substituted either at the start or after\r\na week or ten days. After the ducklings go to the yards the following\r\nfattening ration is used: 200 pounds corn meal, 100 pounds low-grade\r\nflour, 100 pounds bran, 1 part in 10 of beef scrap and 2 tubs or bushels\r\nof green stuff. Some duck growers prefer to feed 300 pounds of corn meal\r\ninstead of 200 pounds. This ration like the other is fed 3 times a day.\r\nOf course, there are many different rations in use with good results,\r\nevery grower having more or less personal preferences in this matter. A\r\nproper proportion of animal feed, consisting of beef scrap or fish is\r\nvery important as the ducklings will not grow and make normal gains if\r\nthis is omitted or reduced in amount.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written about the feeding of celery seed to fattening\r\nducklings for the purpose of improving the flavor of the flesh and\r\nformerly ducklings were advertised and sold as \"celery-fed\". As a matter\r\nof fact, the amount of celery seed fed was small and it is questionable\r\nhow much influence it had on the flavor of the birds. At the present\r\ntime, celery seed is not used in fattening the ducklings on most of the\r\nlarge duck farms of Long Island.\r\n\r\nA comparison of gains made by ducklings on two different rations is\r\nshown in the following table.

In doing this, especially when they are in fairly\r\nlarge lots, they surge back and forth in the pens, running over one\r\nanother with the result that their backs are torn and scratched while\r\nnot infrequently more serious injuries result and may cause cripples.\r\nTo keep them quiet it is common to use lights at night. Formerly\r\nlanterns were used but now on most duck plants electric lights are\r\navailable for this purpose. For a house 140 feet long, six 15-watt\r\nlights scattered at equal intervals will be sufficient, and these can be\r\nused in like proportion for houses of other lengths. The lights are left\r\non all night. Even when the ducks are half grown and may be out on the\r\nyards it is still necessary to use lights on stormy nights so that they\r\nwill stay in and keep quiet and not get drowned in the rain. With a 16 x\r\n24 foot house such as described previously, a single 25 watt light is\r\nsufficient. Ducklings are especially likely to be stampeded during\r\nthunderstorms and if a storm is coming up it is well to turn on the\r\nlights and to shut the ducklings in their shelters when they are first\r\nplaced in the yards. One should not carry a lantern when moving among\r\nthe ducklings at night as this will cause moving shadows which are very\r\nlikely to frighten and stampede the birds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33. Another type of duck shed used on Long Island.\r\n(_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34. Convenient feeding arrangements. At the right of\r\nthe feeding track runs a water pipe with spigots and pans at frequent\r\nintervals. At the left are the feeding trays. (_Photograph from the\r\nBureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_Pounds of Feed to Produce a Pound of Market Duck._ It is stated by long\r\nestablished duck growers that from 5 to 7 pounds of feed is required,\r\nthis including the feed given to the breeding ducks for the season, to\r\nproduce a pound of market duck.\r\n\r\n_Water for Young Ducks._ Drinking water is provided to the ducklings\r\nwhile in the brooder houses by means of a piped supply. The drinking\r\npans are filled at each feeding time but at no other time. Water is not\r\nleft before them continuously while they are in the brooder houses as\r\nthey would be working in it all the time and this would keep them dirty\r\nand make the house sloppy. After they are put out on the yards they may\r\nor may not be provided with water in which they can swim. Most duck\r\ngrowers on Long Island allow them to have access to water. While it is\r\nundoubtedly true that swimming in the water induces them to take more\r\nexercise and thus tends to reduce somewhat the rapidity of fattening, at\r\nthe same time it lessens the labor very materially as they do not need\r\nto be provided with a supply of drinking water other than the water in\r\nwhich they swim. Ducklings can be grown very successfully with only a\r\nlimited amount of water, that is, only enough to drink and in which to\r\nwash themselves.\r\n\r\n_Age and Weight When Ready for Market._ Ducklings are usually marketed\r\nwhen they are 10 to 12 weeks old. A partial moult on the neck and breast\r\noccurs about this time giving them a somewhat rough look. This indicates\r\nthat they are in proper condition to kill. If killing is not done within\r\na week after this moult starts they will begin to lose flesh and it will\r\nbe some time before they will fatten again. Ducks when ready to ship\r\nwill average from 5 to 6 pounds. A majority will weigh nearer 5 than 6\r\npounds. A pen of fattened ducks is driven up to the killing house and\r\ninto a pen where each one is caught up and examined to see if it is in\r\ngood condition. If the duck has a good smooth breast so that the\r\nbreastbone is not felt when handled and is well fleshed on the back it\r\nis ready to kill. If it is not in this condition it is thrown out and\r\nthese thin ducks are returned to the yards for further fattening or are\r\nutilized for shipping alive. Thin ducks are generally used for live\r\nshipments as they will not shrink as much as well fattened ducks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35. An important part of rations for ducks. Green\r\nfeed ready to be cut up into short lengths suitable for mixing in the\r\nfeed. (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department\r\nof Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36. Feeding fattening or yard ducks from the feeding\r\ntrack. (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department\r\nof Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_Cripples._ There will always be found in the flocks more or less\r\ncrippled ducks and those with crooked backs, twisted wings, etc. As a\r\nrule ducks with twisted wings fatten well and are in good condition and\r\ncan be killed about as soon as any of the others. The crippled ducks are\r\nsorted out into a lot by themselves where they are held until they can\r\nbe put into condition to market. It is doubtful whether it pays the duck\r\ngrowers to bother with these ducks since they are rather difficult to\r\ncondition and it would probably pay better to kill them. However, it is\r\nquite common practice to carry them until they can be marketed.\r\n\r\n_Cleaning the Yards._ The yards must be cleaned whenever they need it.\r\nIt is a matter of judgment to decide when this is necessary but they\r\nmust be cleaned whenever they get sticky or sloppy. The weather will\r\nhave a considerable influence upon the frequency of cleaning which may\r\nbe necessary once in two weeks, or in the yards of brooder houses Nos. 2\r\nand 3 may run as often as once a week. In dry weather the yards are\r\ncleaned by sweeping up the droppings and carting them away. In wet\r\nweather the ducks in running about over the yard pack down the droppings\r\nuntil they form a sort of putty-like layer which has to be scraped off\r\nwith a hoe.\r\n\r\n_Critical Period with Young Ducks._ The critical period with young ducks\r\nis the first week of their existence. With good management after they\r\nhave passed this point not many are lost. The loss in young ducks from\r\nthe time they are hatched until they are ready for market will range all\r\nthe way from 5 to 30%. When the loss does not average more than 10% for\r\nthe season this is considered good. Undoubtedly many duck raisers lose a\r\ngreater percent than 10.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37. Yard ducks at rest. (_Photograph from the Bureau\r\nof Animal Industry. U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38. On this plant, the lay of the land was such that\r\nnot all of the yards could be run down to the stream. So a shallow canal\r\nwas dug from the stream through the yards which were without natural\r\nwater frontage. (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\nDisease Prevention\r\n\r\nTrouble from disease in young ducks is not severe although there is a\r\ngreater loss from this source than in the case of mature ducks. The aim\r\nof the grower should be to use such methods of management and feeding as\r\nwill keep the ducklings in good health and reduce the losses to a\r\nminimum. To accomplish this care must be taken to see that the brooding\r\ntemperatures are correct, that the feed used contains what the ducklings\r\nneed, that they are not overfed and that the house and yards are clean\r\nand dry and the feed and water dishes are clean. Remember that green\r\nfeed and animal feed are essential ingredients in the ration.\r\n\r\n_Gapes or Pneumonia._ One of the principal troubles is a disease which\r\nis called \"pneumonia\" by some duck raisers and by others \"gapes\". It is\r\nnot the same disease which is called gapes in chickens. In fact, it is a\r\nform of cold which approaches pneumonia. The little ducks stretch their\r\nnecks up and breathe hard and usually die within a comparatively short\r\ntime. This disease may affect either the baby ducks or ducks which are\r\nold enough to kill. All that can be done is to make sure that the\r\nhousing and brooding conditions are such as to correct the trouble which\r\ncauses the colds.\r\n\r\n_Fits._ In addition, the little ducks for the first 3 or 4 days may be\r\nmore or less subject to a disease which is called \"fits\" by some duck\r\ngrowers. With this disease they simply keel over and soon die. It is\r\nprobably a digestive difficulty of some sort. The feeding of plenty of\r\ngreen stuff or the turning of the ducks out on grass will usually stop\r\nthis trouble.\r\n\r\n_Diarrhoea._ This is a fairly common trouble. It may be due to improper\r\nfeeding, or to too high or low temperature in the brooder. The obvious\r\ntreatment is to remedy the cause or causes of the trouble.\r\n\r\n_Lameness._ Not infrequently growers, particularly beginners, experience\r\ndifficulty from a fairly large proportion of their ducklings becoming\r\nlame. This may grow worse until a considerable number of the birds will\r\ndie. This trouble may be due to a lack of animal matter and mineral\r\nmatter in the ration or may be due to digestive troubles caused by poor\r\nrations, by over feeding, by failing to gather up feed not eaten by the\r\nducklings and leaving it to sour, or by lack of cleanliness of the feed\r\nand water dishes. Where the pens are allowed to become damp and sloppy\r\nthis may also cause some lameness.\r\n\r\n_Sore Eyes._ Occasionally duck growers complain that their ducklings\r\nsuffer from sore eyes. This may be due to a cold causing a discharge\r\nfrom the eyes or may be due to the use of too sloppy feed which adheres\r\nto the eyes and causes an irritation. Affected birds should be placed in\r\na separate pen from the others and the eyes should be bathed with an\r\nantiseptic solution.\r\n\r\n_Feather Eating or \"Quilling\"._ This is a bad habit which is apt to\r\ncause more or less trouble when the ducklings are about two-thirds\r\ngrown. It is much more likely to occur when the birds are kept in\r\ncramped quarters. It is usually started by one or a few individuals but\r\nwhen the feathers are injured so that they begin to bleed, which they\r\nwill very quickly do, the vice will spread among the whole flock and\r\nserious damage will occur. It is therefore necessary to be on the\r\nlookout for this trouble, and as soon as detected, the birds responsible\r\nshould be removed. If the culprits are placed with older birds which are\r\nalready feathered, they will not trouble by trying to eat the feathers.\r\nIt is the blood in the growing feathers which attracts them. If the\r\nhabit has become general, it is more difficult to check. About the best\r\nthing that can be done, is to turn them out in a roomy yard, one with a\r\ngrowing green crop, if available, where they will be so busy as to stop\r\nthe feather eating of their own accord.\r\n\r\n_Rats._--Rats are very destructive if they get into the brooder house. A\r\nsingle rat has been known to kill and drag off as many as 200 ducklings\r\nin one night. If a rat gets into the brooder house it is therefore of\r\nthe utmost importance that it be hunted down and killed without delay.\r\nOtherwise serious losses will result.\r\n\r\n\r\nCooperative Feed Association\r\n\r\nA very large proportion of the feed used on a duck plant is that which\r\nis fed to the market ducks. By purchasing feed in considerable\r\nquantities the duck grower is able to cut down the cost to some extent.\r\nA number of the duck raisers on Long Island have developed this idea\r\nfurther by forming a cooperative feed organization. Stock in this\r\nconcern is held both by the duck growers and by outsiders but is\r\ncontrolled by the duck growers. The feed association maintains a feed\r\nwarehouse, purchases feeds in quantity and does business both with the\r\nduck growers and with other persons in the market for feed. The\r\nexistence of a cooperative feed purchasing association of this sort not\r\nonly cuts down to some extent the cost of feed but likewise makes it\r\npossible for the duck growers to have greater assurance of securing the\r\nsupply which is so necessary to them during the growing season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nCommercial Duck Farming--Marketing\r\n\r\n\r\nOn commercial duck farms, the business consists mainly of producing\r\nlarge quickly grown ducklings which are marketed before they are mature.\r\nBecause of this immaturity, the ducks are quite commonly termed green\r\nducks. The business has also become so highly specialized on Long Island\r\nand this is such a center of the industry, that the birds are commonly\r\nquoted on the New York market as Long Island ducklings.\r\n\r\n_Proper Age to Market._ It is important that the ducklings be marketed\r\nas soon as they have reached the proper age and stage of development.\r\nWhen the ducklings are about 10 to 12 weeks old they begin to shed their\r\nfirst growth of feathers. This is apparent first on the neck and breast,\r\ngiving them somewhat of a rough appearance. The ducklings must be\r\nmarketed within one week after they begin this moult. If they are\r\nallowed to go longer than this they will begin to get thin and as it\r\nwill take them 6 weeks or more to grow a new crop of feathers it will be\r\na considerable period before they get back in market condition again and\r\nany additional weight which they may attain will not be sufficient to\r\npay for the feed eaten during this period.\r\n\r\n_Weights at the Time of Marketing._ Well grown ducklings should average\r\nin weight from 5 to 6 pounds at 10 to 12 weeks of age when they are\r\nready to be marketed. A majority of the ducks will weigh closer to 5\r\npounds than they will to 6. The vast majority of ducklings are marketed\r\nat this age as it does not pay to keep them past the time they reach\r\nprime market condition. On commercial duck farms practically the only\r\nducks which are marketed at an older age than this are the breeders\r\nwhich are turned off at the end of the laying season and the ducklings\r\nwhich by reason of their being crippled or less thrifty are not in\r\nsuitable market condition at this time and are held longer until they\r\nare in good condition. The ducklings are marketed from early spring\r\nuntil late fall. The time at which ducklings are first available for\r\nmarket in any quantity depends upon the earliness with which the\r\nbreeders begin to lay and the end of the season depends upon how late\r\nthe breeders continue to lay at a profitable rate.\r\n\r\n_The Last Feed for Market Ducks._ It is important in order to have the\r\ndressed ducklings appear to the best advantage and also in order to\r\ninsure their keeping qualities as much as possible that they should have\r\nno feed in their crops when they are killed. This means that if they are\r\nto be killed in the morning, which is the usual practice, they should be\r\nfed for the last time the previous night. If, however, they are not to\r\nbe killed until afternoon they can be fed lightly in the morning.\r\n\r\n_Sorting Market Ducklings._ When a pen of ducklings which are being\r\nfattened are deemed ready to be killed they are driven up to the killing\r\nhouse and a few of them at a time driven into a small pen where it is\r\neasy to catch and examine them. Each duck as it is caught is examined to\r\nmake sure that it is in proper market condition. The examination\r\nconsists of feeling of the duck's body to see that it has a good smooth\r\nbreast so that the breast bone cannot be readily felt. If it is in that\r\ncondition it is ready to kill. Ducks which do not show this condition\r\nare thrown out and returned to the yards where they are fed for a longer\r\nperiod unless it is desired to ship them alive.\r\n\r\nAt the proper season of the year when breeders for the next season are\r\nto be selected, suitable birds for that purpose are picked out from the\r\nmarket lots as they are examined. In any lot of ducks there will be\r\nfound some cripples. It is common practice to sort these out and group\r\nthem together in a pen by themselves where they are held until they are\r\nin suitable condition for marketing. It is doubtful whether it pays to\r\nhold these cripples as they are hard to get in good condition and in\r\nmany cases are probably kept and fed at a loss. Some ducklings will show\r\ntwisted wings but as a rule they are thrifty and will fatten readily and\r\nbe in good market condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39. Awaiting slaughter. The fattened ducklings are\r\ndriven into these catching pens. (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40. Carrying the ducklings from the catching pen to\r\nthe killing place. (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U.\r\nS. Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_Killing._ As the ducklings suitable for killing are selected, 10 or 12\r\nof them, depending upon the capacity of the killing room, are hung up by\r\ntheir feet, the head being fastened down by means of a hook or else\r\nweighted down by means of a blood can hung from a hook inserted through\r\nthe bill. By means of a long, narrow bladed sharp knife the veins in the\r\nthroat just beyond the skull are severed so as to cause free bleeding.\r\nThe blood flows either into the blood can or into a trough above which\r\nthe birds are hung. The birds are not stuck or brained unless it is\r\ndesired to dry pick them nor are they as a rule stunned by hitting them\r\non the head before bleeding. In some states, however, the law requires\r\nthat all birds bled shall first be stunned in this manner. The bleeding\r\nof the ducks causes their death and they are allowed to hang until they\r\nare thoroughly bled out. They are then taken down, the blood washed off\r\nof their heads and placed on a table or on the floor convenient to the\r\npickers, other ducks being hung in their places.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41. The ducks are hung by the feet and the veins in\r\nthe neck cut from inside the mouth to cause free bleeding. (_Photograph\r\nfrom the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42. After the throat veins are cut, the ducks are\r\nallowed to hang until they are well bled out. The blood is caught in the\r\ntrough below. (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43. Ducks which have been bled, ready to have the\r\nblood washed from their heads and mouths before they are picked.\r\n(_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44. After they are bled and washed, the ducks are\r\nlaid in the picking room ready for the pickers. (_Photograph from the\r\nBureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_Scalding._ The picker selects a duck from the table where they are\r\nplaced after being taken down and carries it to a large kettle of water\r\nwhich is maintained at a temperature just below boiling. They are\r\nthoroughly soused in this water holding them by the head and feet so as\r\nto allow the water to penetrate into the feathers until they can be\r\nreadily plucked. The picker tests the readiness with which the feathers\r\ncome out by plucking a few from the breast or body and thus determines\r\nwhether the scalding is sufficient or whether more is required. Care is\r\ntaken not to dip the feet or head in the water as this might discolor\r\nthese parts. Practically all market ducks from Long Island are scald\r\npicked at the present time. Dry picking which is demanded in some\r\nmarkets such as Boston makes a somewhat better looking carcass and also\r\nincreases the value of the feathers, but is generally considered too\r\nslow and too highly skilled a process for use on the average duck farm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45. Holding the head in one hand and the feet in the\r\nother, the picker dips the duck in water heated nearly to the boiling\r\npoint and souses well to work the water into the feathers until they\r\npluck easily. (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_Picking._. After scalding the picker starts removing the feathers. In\r\ndoing this the duck is held either on the lap or on a board nailed to\r\nthe side of the feather box. The feathers on the breast are picked\r\nfirst, then working down toward the tail, pulling the feathers with the\r\ngrain. The soft body feathers as plucked are thrown into the feather\r\nbox, the coarser feathers being thrown on the floor. The main wing and\r\ntail feathers are left on as are likewise some of the feathers of the\r\nneck next the head.\r\n\r\nThe most troublesome part of picking ducks is removing the down. This\r\nmay be removed to some extent by rubbing with the hand although care\r\nmust be taken not to bruise the skin severely. In some cases the down is\r\nshaved off with a sharp knife. In some of the commercial packing houses\r\nthe duck's body is sprinkled with powdered rosin and then dipped into\r\nthe hot water. This melts the rosin so that the down and rosin can be\r\nrubbed off easily with the hand leaving the body clean. Pin feathers\r\nare usually removed by grasping them between the thumb and a dull knife.\r\n\r\nIn some packing houses, ducks are steamed before picking. Where this is\r\ndone they are picked clean and the wing and tail feathers are pulled\r\nbefore steaming takes place. Six or eight ducks which have been bled are\r\nhung at the same time in the top of a steam box or barrel which can be\r\nmade air-tight and the steam turned on until the soft feathers of the\r\nbreast come off easily. The length of time to steam depends on the\r\ntemperature of the steam itself and varies from one-half to 2 minutes.\r\nIn some cases the ducks are hung in a steam box with the heads outside\r\nso as to prevent the steam from coming into contact with the heads,\r\npossibly discoloring them.\r\n\r\nOn Long Island women are used very largely for picking and they secure\r\nfor this service 6 cents per duck. A good picker should do 75 ducks or\r\neven more a day. The value of the feathers will slightly more than pay\r\nfor the cost of picking.\r\n\r\nPicking usually begins early in the morning about 6 o'clock and is\r\ngenerally finished by noon or soon after. Most duck raisers figure on\r\ndoing their killing and picking during the first half of the week and do\r\nnot like to kill if they can help it during the latter days of the week.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46. Picking the ducks. (_Photograph from the Bureau\r\nof Animal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_Dry Picking._ Where the market requires it, the ducks must be dry\r\npicked. In doing this the procedure is the same as in dry picking\r\nchickens. After the cut is made to bleed the ducks, the point of the\r\nknife is plunged through the roof of the mouth until it reaches the\r\nbrain when it is turned to cause a paralysis of the muscles which\r\nenables the feathers to be plucked more easily. The duck is then struck\r\non the back of the head with a club to stun it and make it easier to\r\nhandle when picking. The picker seats himself by the feather box, with\r\nthe duck on his lap, holding the head pressed against the outside of the\r\nbox and held there by the picker's leg. He then proceeds immediately and\r\nas quickly as possible to pluck the feathers. It is necessary to\r\naccomplish this without delay, for the feathers soon set and are then\r\nmuch harder to pluck and are more likely to result in tears in the skin.\r\nWhen removing the down, the hand is moistened when much of the down can\r\nbe rubbed off. Pin feathers are removed by grasping them between the\r\nthumb and the edge of a dull knife and any which cannot be gotten in\r\nthis way are shaved off with a sharp knife. After picking, the carcasses\r\nare cooled in cold water the same as the scalded birds.\r\n\r\n_Cooling._ After the birds are plucked they are thrown into cold water\r\nand are left there for several hours or until the body heat is entirely\r\nremoved. It is most important that this be thoroughly accomplished for\r\nif any body heat is left in the carcasses they are almost sure to become\r\ngreen-struck when packed. The length of time that they must be left\r\nin the water depends upon the weather conditions. If the weather is warm\r\nso that the water is not very cool it is necessary to add ice in order\r\nto hasten the cooling and to accomplish it thoroughly. Cooling in water\r\nalso serves to plump the carcasses somewhat.\r\n\r\n_Packing._ After the ducks are thoroughly cooled they are removed from\r\nthe water and packed. Long Island ducklings are usually packed in\r\nbarrels. Forty-five ducks will pack in a sugar barrel and 33 in a flour\r\nbarrel. The proper number for the barrel used is placed on hanging\r\nspring scales and weighed before being packed. The best method of\r\npacking is to lay the ducks on their sides. If they are packed on their\r\nbacks or bellies, the ice used between the layers is apt to cause a\r\ncutting or bruising of the soft abdomens and injure the appearance of\r\nthe carcasses. Between each layer of ducks a scoopful of cracked ice is\r\nused although in cool weather it may only be necessary to use half a\r\nscoop of ice. After the barrel is packed it should be allowed to stand\r\nfor a while to settle. Then the top of the barrel is piled up with\r\ncracked ice and covered with burlap. On the side of the barrel is marked\r\nthe number of ducks and their weight. Later a card is tacked alongside\r\nof this showing the consignee's and the shipper's names as well as the\r\nnumber of ducks and their weight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47. Dressed duckling.

After thorough cooling a sufficient number of\r\nducks to fill a barrel is weighed out and packed with or without ice\r\ndepending upon the weather. (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_Shipping._ The barrels should be packed and shipped the same evening.\r\nShipping may be done either by express or by automobile truck. A good\r\nmany of the Long Island ducklings are now shipped into New York City by\r\ntruck.\r\n\r\n_Cooperative Marketing Association._ The duck growers on Long Island\r\nhave formed a cooperative marketing association. This association\r\nmaintains its own house in New York City and sells practically the\r\nentire output of Long Island ducklings, controlling probably 90%. During\r\nthe year 1919 there were in the neighborhood of 800,000 head of ducks\r\nmarketed through this house. Practically all of the capital stock of\r\nthis concern is held by the duck growers and they are not allowed to\r\nsell any of their stock without first offering it to the association.\r\n\r\n_Prices for Ducks._ Early in the season the ducklings bring the best\r\nprices, that is to say from March 1 to May 1. Then as the output of\r\nducks increases prices gradually drop. The heaviest shipments occur in\r\nJune, July and August. In September as the output of ducks begins to\r\ndrop off the price begins to climb a little. The following prices as\r\nquoted in the New York Produce Review show the range from March, 1920,\r\nto June, 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong Island Ducklings--Fresh Dressed\r\n\r\n\r\n1920\r\n\r\nMarch 31

Alive_. While the great majority of ducks are shipped\r\ndressed there is some shipment of live ducks. This is particularly true\r\nduring the Jewish holidays in March and in September and October when\r\nthe demand for live ducks and the price paid for them is excellent. As a\r\nrule it pays better to ship alive the ducks which are inclined to be a\r\nlittle thin rather than to ship those which are in top market condition.\r\nThis is due to the fact that fat ducks will shrink very considerably\r\nwhen cooped and shipped alive, this shrinkage running from one-half to\r\nthree-quarters of a pound per head where they are cooped not to exceed\r\n12 to 15 hours. The ducks which are in the fattest condition will shrink\r\nthe most. At the season of the year when live ducks are in best demand\r\nit often pays to ship alive the ducklings which are sorted out as not\r\nbeing in the best condition rather than to hold them for further\r\nfattening.\r\n\r\n_Saving the Feathers._ The feathers from the ducks form quite an\r\nimportant source of revenue to the duck farmers. As stated before the\r\nvalue of the feathers will a little more than pay for the cost of\r\npicking and since this is a considerable item of expense the grower\r\ncannot afford to neglect the feathers. The soft body feathers are kept\r\nseparate from the coarser feathers, the latter being thrown on the floor\r\nas they are plucked. These coarser feathers are later swept up and are\r\ncommonly spoken of as sweepings. Feathers from dry-picked ducks are\r\nsuperior in quality and bring a better price but most of the duck\r\nfeathers now marketed from commercial duck farms are scalded feathers.\r\nThe feathers after each day's killing are gathered up and spread out in\r\na loft where they can be placed in a layer not over 3 or 4 inches deep.\r\nThis should be an airy place so as to give the feathers a good place to\r\ndry out. On the second day they are scraped up in a pile and then spread\r\nout again, thus turning them over and changing their position. They are\r\nthen left until they are dry enough to sack which should be in a little\r\nover a week. Unless the feathers are thoroughly dried out they will heat\r\nwhen sacked and this will seriously hurt their market quality. When dry\r\nthey are packed either in the large special feather sacks made for this\r\npurpose or in smaller sacks, about as big as two bran sacks, which will\r\nhold from 60 to 80 pounds of feathers. The feathers are shipped to\r\nregular feather dealers or manufacturers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49. A valuable by-product of duck plants. The\r\nfeathers from a duck will pay for the cost of picking. (_Photograph from\r\nthe Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_Prices and Uses of Duck Feathers._ The soft body feathers and the\r\ncoarser feathers often called \"sweepings\" should be kept and sold\r\nseparate. While scalded feathers are not worth as much as dry picked\r\nfeathers, the former if properly dried out or cured will find a ready\r\nsale. Feathers packed before they are thoroughly dried out, are likely\r\nto arrive at their destination in a matted and musty or heated\r\ncondition. This, of course, injures their quality and the price paid for\r\nthem is discounted according to their condition.\r\n\r\nThe soft body feathers of ducks are used almost entirely for bedding\r\npurposes, that is, are put in pillows and feather beds. White feathers\r\nare preferred and usually bring a somewhat higher price.\r\n\r\nThe prices paid for the feathers vary quite widely at different times of\r\nthe year, and in different sections of the country, and also of course\r\nwith the condition of the feathers themselves. The quotations given\r\nbelow represent the prices paid in June, 1921.\r\n\r\nDuck Feathers               Cents     Per Pound\r\nPure white, dry picked      50         \"    \"\r\nStained and scalded white   40         \"    \"\r\nDark or mixed, dry picked   33         \"    \"\r\nDark or mixed, scalded      20 to 25   \"    \"\r\n\r\n_Marketing Eggs._ On commercial duck farms very few eggs are marketed.\r\nThis is due to the fact that the duck growers find it more profitable to\r\nincubate all eggs suitable for that purpose and to rear and market the\r\nducklings rather than to sell the eggs. There are always, however, a\r\ncertain number of cracked eggs and others which may be too large or too\r\nsmall to use for hatching and which are therefore marketed. In addition\r\nthe infertile eggs tested out on the 5th day are sold. The eggs may be\r\npacked in ordinary 30 dozen egg cases such as are used for hens' eggs,\r\nutilizing a special filler 5 cells square. With these fillers a case\r\nholds 20 5-6 dozen duck eggs. A special duck case, holding 30 dozen duck\r\neggs may be used, the fillers in this case being 6 cells square like the\r\nfillers used for hens' eggs. The cells in these fillers are 2 inches\r\nsquare and 2-1/4 or 2-1/2 inches deep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nDuck Raising on the Farm\r\n\r\n\r\nDuck raising as ordinarily conducted on the general farm consists of the\r\nkeeping of a comparatively small flock purely as a side line. Ducks on\r\nthe general farm may be kept for the production of meat and eggs, for\r\negg production, or mainly as a breeding proposition where the idea is to\r\nproduce birds of exhibition quality. On occasional farms ducks of the\r\nrarer breeds are kept mainly for ornamental purposes.\r\n\r\n_Conditions Suitable for Duck Raising._ A small flock of ducks on the\r\nfarm can be kept to best advantage where they can be separated from the\r\nother poultry and where they can have access to a pasture or an orchard\r\nwhich will provide them with a plentiful supply of green feed. Ducks\r\nstand confinement quite well but if they are closely confined it is\r\nnecessary to provide for them the green feed which they cannot secure\r\nfor themselves. On many farms the flock of ducks is allowed to range at\r\nliberty and under these conditions the cost of maintaining them is much\r\nlower since they pick up a considerable part of their feed. An enclosed\r\nrun or yard, however, should be available where they can be confined\r\nwhen desired. It is also necessary to provide a house or shed in which\r\nthey can be shut at night and during the early morning. Otherwise, many\r\nof the eggs may be dropped anywhere about the place or in the water with\r\nthe result that some of them will be lost. A pond or stream to which the\r\nducks can have access and in which they can swim is a great advantage\r\nsince it helps to keep them in good breeding condition. It is a common\r\nbut mistaken idea that low, wet land is best suited for ducks.\r\n\r\n_Size of Flock._--The average farm flock of ducks is small, rarely\r\nrunning over 15 to 20 head. In many cases not over 10 or 12 ducks with\r\none or two drakes will be kept. A flock of this size will furnish quite\r\na large number of ducks for the farmer's table or for sale in addition\r\nto more or less eggs which can either be used at home or sold.\r\n\r\n_Making a Start._ In making a start with a farm flock of ducks it is\r\nprobably best to figure on keeping only a few head. If the farmer begins\r\nwith 4 or 5 ducks and one drake he can make his start at small expense\r\nand from this number he will be able to increase the size of his flock\r\nif he finds that results warrant it. Probably the best way to make a\r\nstart is to purchase the desired breeding stock in the fall. This will\r\ngive the ducks a chance to get settled and to be in good condition and\r\naccustomed to their quarters by spring so that they will begin to breed\r\nand lay.\r\n\r\nEggs for hatching can be purchased if desired and the young ducklings\r\nhatched and reared with chicken hens. Baby ducks are rarely purchased in\r\nmaking a start as are baby chicks.\r\n\r\n_Selecting the Breed._ Any one of the breeds forming the so-called meat\r\nclass will prove satisfactory for a farm flock. This class includes the\r\nPekin, Aylesbury, Muscovy, Rouen, Cayuga, Buff and Blue Swedish. The\r\nbirds of any of these breeds are of good size and therefore produce a\r\nsuitable table fowl. At the same time they are layers and will produce\r\neggs for the table or for market as well. Where the purpose in keeping\r\nthe ducks is mainly that of producing eggs for market the Runner is\r\nundoubtedly the breed to select. While these ducks are smaller in size\r\nthe ducklings will make good carcasses of broiler size for the table\r\nbeing killed for this purpose when about 2-1/2 to 3 pounds in weight. In\r\naddition, the Runner is the best laying breed and by many persons is\r\nconsidered to be equal in its egg producing qualities to any of the\r\nbreeds of chickens.\r\n\r\nSelection of any breed or variety of the meat or egg classes and\r\nespecially the selection of a breed or variety for ornamental purposes\r\nor for the pleasure of breeding will depend upon the individual\r\npreference of the owner for body shape, color of plumage and other\r\ncharacteristics. A pure breed of some kind should by all means be kept\r\nin preference to the common or so-called \"puddle\" duck. Not only will\r\nthe pure breeds give greater uniformity in the carcasses produced but\r\nthe results in egg production will likewise be better.\r\n\r\n_Age of Breeding Stock._ The best results in breeding are secured from\r\nducks during their first laying season. Not only is egg production\r\nbetter but they are less likely to become so fat and large as to\r\ninterfere with the fertility and hatchability of the eggs. In fact, on\r\ncommercial duck farms the breeding stock is entirely renewed each year.\r\nHowever, ducks can be profitably kept until they are 2 or 3 years old,\r\nand it is common practice in a farm flock to hold over some of the\r\nbreeders after they have finished their first year. Of course, where the\r\nduck breeder has some especially fine stock which will produce just the\r\nquality he desires in the offspring, he holds and utilizes these birds\r\njust as long as they are in good breeding condition. As a rule it is\r\nbest not to hold breeding ducks after they have finished their second\r\nlaying season.\r\n\r\n_Size of Matings._ The proper number of ducks which should be mated to a\r\ndrake varies with the different breeds. Pekins and Aylesbury can be\r\nmated in the proportion of one drake to 6 to 8 ducks. In the Rouen mate\r\n4 or 5 ducks to a drake and in the Cayuga 5 or 6 ducks to a drake. In\r\nthe Muscovy as high as 10 females may be mated with one male. In the\r\nBlue Swedish and Buff mate in the proportion of 6 or 7 ducks to one\r\ndrake. In the Call and East India breeds from 5 to 8 ducks can be mated\r\nto one drake. In the Crested White use 5 or 6 ducks and in the Runner\r\n6 to 8 ducks to a drake.\r\n\r\nWhere young drakes are used more ducks can be mated to them than is the\r\ncase with old drakes. It is also true that where especially large\r\nexhibition birds have been reserved for breeding purposes it is\r\nnecessary to reduce the number of ducks mated to a drake as otherwise\r\nthe fertility is very likely to run lower with these older heavier\r\nducks.\r\n\r\n_Breeding and Laying Season._ Under ordinary farm conditions where the\r\nducks receive only fairly good care and feed the laying does not begin\r\nto any extent until February or March. With exceptional care the ducks\r\nwill begin to lay in January and a few may even lay in December. The\r\nducks lay very persistently and continue their laying until hot weather\r\nsets in or usually about the first of July. They gradually let up in\r\ntheir laying until it ceases almost entirely soon after that date. The\r\nbreeding season is at its height in the months of April and May. At this\r\ntime the fertility will run best and the results in hatching will be\r\nmost satisfactory. However, it is possible to continue to hatch the duck\r\neggs which are produced with fair results as long as the ducks continue\r\nto lay.\r\n\r\n\r\nManagement of Breeders.\r\n\r\n_Housing._ Some sort of house or shelter must be provided for the\r\nbreeding flock. Any available shed or a part of the poultry house may\r\nbe utilized for this purpose. No special requirements are necessary\r\nexcept that the house should provide sufficient ventilation. This is\r\nbest furnished by means of a window and in addition, an opening in the\r\nfront of the house should be provided which can be closed by means of a\r\ncurtain during severe winter weather. A board floor is not necessary if\r\nthe dirt floor is filled up 6 or 8 inches above the ground level outside\r\nthe house. The floors should be provided with an abundance of litter\r\nwhich is usually changed only once or twice during the year. As the\r\nlitter tends to become dirty more litter must be added. No equipment is\r\nnecessary in the houses as the birds rest on the floor and lay their\r\neggs anywhere about the house or wherever they may make their nests. The\r\nhouse should be so arranged that the ducks can be shut in at night and\r\ncan be kept there until they have finished laying in the morning. As\r\nmost of the duck eggs are laid early in the morning they can be let out\r\nby 8 or 9 o'clock in the summer. If let out earlier than this they are\r\nlikely to lay some of their eggs in the pond or stream to which they\r\nhave access and these would be lost.\r\n\r\n_Feeding._ On many farms the breeding flock of ducks is fed on the same\r\nration which is given the farm fowls. However, better results will be\r\nobtained if they are given special feeds. After the laying season is\r\nover the breeding ducks can be fed sparingly on a mash consisting of one\r\npart by weight corn meal, 2 parts bran, 1 part low grade wheat flour, 1\r\npart green feed, 8% beef scrap and 3% oyster shell. This mash is mixed\r\nup with water until it has a consistency just between sticky and\r\ncrumbly. It should never be fed in a sloppy condition. A feed of this\r\nmash should be given in the morning and at night and during the long\r\ndays of summer it is well also to give a light feed of cracked corn or\r\nmixed grains in the middle of the day. However, judgment must be used in\r\nfeeding ducks especially if they have range over which they can roam\r\nwhere they can pick up more or less animal feed and other material. In\r\nthis case it is not necessary to feed nearly so much. Another mash which\r\nmay be used instead of the one given consists of 3 parts by measure of\r\ncorn meal, 4 parts bran, 2 parts low grade wheat flour, three-fourths\r\npart beef scrap and 2 parts green feed with a supply of oyster shell.\r\n\r\nAlong about December 1 the feed should be changed with the idea of\r\ninducing egg production. A feed consisting of one part by weight corn\r\nmeal, 1 part low grade flour or middlings, 1 part bran, 15% beef scrap,\r\n15% vegetables or green feed together with oyster shell should be fed\r\nmorning and evening and in addition a feed consisting of corn and wheat\r\nmay be given at noon in a quantity of about one quart for each 30 ducks.\r\nAs much mash should be given them at the morning and evening feed as\r\nthey will clean up.\r\n\r\nAnother good mash feed which may be used consists of 2 parts by weight\r\nof bran, 2 parts middlings, 2 parts corn meal, 1 part beef scrap, 1 part\r\nground oats and one-tenth of the total weight sand. In addition, of\r\ncourse, green feed must be added to the ration if it is not available at\r\nall times in the yard. This mash is fed in the morning and in the\r\nevening. The noon feed consists of 1 part by weight of corn and 2 parts\r\noats. Where green feed is not available and must be supplied, cut\r\nclover, alfalfa, rye, oats and corn may be utilized cut up into short\r\npieces and mixed in the mash. The mash should be fed either to breeding\r\nstock or to ducklings on flat trays or boards rather than in troughs as\r\nthe ducks can get at it better in this form. It must be kept in mind\r\nthat while ducks are good egg producers during the laying and breeding\r\nseason they will not lay any great number of eggs unless they are fed\r\nfor this purpose. For rations used on commercial duck farms see Chapter\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n_Water._ It is important that a plentiful supply of drinking water be\r\navailable to the ducks. A fresh supply must be provided at each feeding\r\ntime before the feed is thrown to the ducks as they like to eat and\r\ndrink alternately when feeding. Where the breeding ducks have access to\r\na stream or pond of fresh water it is not necessary to provide any other\r\nsupply of drinking water.\r\n\r\nWhere water is available in which the ducks can swim it is essential to\r\nsee that provision is made so that the ducks can get in and out of the\r\nwater easily. If this is not done they may become exhausted and unable\r\nto climb out or they may become partially cramped when the water is very\r\ncold with the result that they will drown. If given access to water in\r\nwhich they can swim during cold weather it is necessary to be on the\r\nlook-out to see that the ducks do not freeze fast to the ground when\r\nthey come out of the water.\r\n\r\n_Yards._ Where yards are provided for ducks poultry netting about 2 feet\r\nhigh is ordinarily used. This will confine most of the breeds but higher\r\nfences even 5 or 6 feet high must be provided for the breeds which fly\r\nreadily such as the Muscovy, Call, East India, Mallard, Wood and\r\nMandarin. In some cases it is even necessary to cover over the tops of\r\nthe yards in order to keep the birds from flying out or to pinion the\r\nbirds, that is, to cut off the outermost joint of one wing. The netting\r\nused for yards should be strung on posts set in the ground and the lower\r\nedge should be pegged down so that the birds cannot get under it.\r\n\r\n_Care of Eggs for Hatching._ Duck eggs for hatching must be gathered\r\neach day and should be put in some cool place to be held until they are\r\nset. They should be turned daily, the same as hens' eggs and the general\r\ncare is exactly similar. It does not, however, pay to keep duck eggs as\r\nlong before setting them as they spoil more quickly than hens' eggs. In\r\nfact, it is best to set duck eggs when they are not over a week old if\r\nthis can be arranged.\r\n\r\n_Hatching the Eggs._ The period of incubation for duck eggs ranges from\r\n26 to 28 days for all of the breeds except the Muscovy. In this breed it\r\ntakes from 33 to 36 days for the eggs to hatch. Inasmuch as most of the\r\ncommonly kept breeds are not very broody and therefore do not make\r\nreliable hatchers and mothers it is necessary to resort either to the\r\nuse of chicken hens for this purpose or else to utilize incubators.\r\nEither one of these methods can be used with good success. With the\r\nsmall farm flock it is very common to utilize hens. The ordinary hen\r\nwill be able to cover 9 to 11 duck eggs to advantage depending on her\r\nsize and upon the season of the year. In cold weather the smaller number\r\nshould be used rather than the larger number. Before setting the hen she\r\nshould be thoroughly dusted with insect powder to free her from lice.\r\nSeveral hens can be set in the same room but they should be confined on\r\ntheir nests allowing them to come off only once a day for feed and\r\nwater. Cracked corn makes an excellent feed for sitting hens. If desired\r\nMuscovy, Call, East India, Mallard, Wood or Mandarin ducks can be\r\nallowed to make their nests and to hatch their eggs as they are reliable\r\nsitters and good mothers.\r\n\r\nAfter the duck eggs first pip there usually elapses a longer period of\r\ntime before the ducklings get out of the shell than is the case with\r\nchicks. For this reason it is well to take the hens off for feed and\r\nwater when the first eggs are pipped returning them to the nest as\r\nquickly as possible and confining them there until the hatch is over.\r\n\r\nDuring the last week of incubation it is desirable to sprinkle the eggs\r\ndaily with water using quite a liberal amount as duck eggs seem to\r\nrequire more moisture than hens' eggs in order to hatch well.\r\n\r\nAll duck eggs which are at all badly soiled should be washed before they\r\nare set. Washing does not seem to injure their hatching qualities. In\r\nfact, some breeders prefer to wash all duck eggs whether dirty or not,\r\nfeeling that this opens up the pores and causes a better hatch. This\r\nbelief is based upon the idea that when ducks hatch their own eggs under\r\nnatural conditions they have access to water in which they swim and in\r\ncoming back on the nest their wet feathers serve to wash the eggs.\r\n\r\nWhere an incubator is used for hatching the eggs are placed in the\r\nmachine just as hens' eggs. For the first week the temperature is kept\r\nabout 102 degrees and for the rest of the period is maintained as close\r\nto 103 degrees as possible, the bulb of the thermometer being on a level\r\nwith the tops of the eggs. Often the temperature will run up a little\r\nhigher than this at hatching time but this does not do any harm. An\r\nincubator will accommodate from four-fifths to five-sixths as many duck\r\neggs as it will hens' eggs.\r\n\r\nAbout the fifth or sixth day the duck eggs are tested and all infertile\r\nand dead germs removed. From this time on eggs are turned twice a day\r\nand usually cooled once a day until they pip. A second test may be made\r\nabout the fifteenth or sixteenth day when any eggs which have died are\r\nremoved. If dead germ eggs are left in the machines they spoil very\r\nquickly and cause a strong odor which makes it necessary to remove them.\r\nDuring the last week or ten days and in some cases for a longer period\r\nthan this incubator operators supply moisture daily to the machine. This\r\nis usually provided by sprinkling the eggs liberally with water which\r\nhas been warmed to about the temperature of the machine. However, if\r\nwarm water is not available, water of ordinary temperature may be used\r\nalthough it is not well to use extremely cold water. As a rule the eggs\r\nbegin to pip about the twenty-sixth day. At this time the machine should\r\nbe tightly closed up and left so until the hatching is over. In case\r\nmoisture seems to be lacking and the ducklings are having a hard time to\r\nget out of the shell the machine can be opened and the eggs sprinkled\r\nagain. If there seems to be sufficient moisture, however, the machines\r\nshould not be opened or disturbed. As a rule it takes ducklings from 24\r\nto 48 hours to hatch after the pipping first begins. It is advisable to\r\nleave the ducklings in the incubator until they are well dried off\r\nbefore removing them to the brooder. As a rule the hatching will be\r\nentirely over by the twenty-eighth day.\r\n\r\n_Brooding and Rearing._ Ducklings can be brooded if desired by means of\r\nchicken hens. In this case the ducklings which the hen hatches should\r\nbe given to her and she should be confined to some kind of a coop which\r\nwill allow the ducklings to run at liberty. If the hen is given her\r\nliberty she goes too far and takes too much exercise for the little\r\nducks. Where artificial brooders are used any type of brooding apparatus\r\ncan be utilized which is used with success for chickens. It must be\r\nremembered, however, that ducklings do not require as high a degree of\r\nheat as do baby chicks and should be started off at a temperature of\r\nabout 90 degrees under the hover. This can be reduced rather rapidly\r\nuntil it is down to 80 at about 2 weeks of age. The length of time that\r\nthe ducklings require heat after this depends upon the season and the\r\nweather. Even in fairly cool weather they do not need any heat after\r\nthey are 5 or 6 weeks old.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to keep the brooders clean and in order to do this they\r\nmust be cleaned out frequently and new litter supplied. While the\r\nducklings are small the brooders should be cleaned at least every other\r\nday and as they get larger, cleaning once a week with the addition of\r\nfresh litter between times will be sufficient.\r\n\r\n_Feeding the Ducklings._ Ducklings do not need to be fed until they are\r\nfrom 24 to 36 hours old. At this time they may be given a mixture\r\ncomposed of equal parts by measure of rolled oats and bread crumbs with\r\n3% of sharp sand mixed in the feed. This may be given them five times\r\ndaily although some duck raisers feed only 3 times daily from the\r\nstart. About the third day this feed is changed to equal parts of bread,\r\nrolled oats, bran and corn meal. After the seventh day the ration may\r\nconsist of 3 parts bran, 1 part each of low-grade wheat flour and corn\r\nmeal, 10% green feed, 5% beef scrap with about 3% of sand mixed in.\r\n\r\nThe ducklings should be fed four times daily after the seventh day until\r\nthey are two or three weeks old. After that time they need be fed only\r\nthree times daily, morning, noon and night. The sand may be given to the\r\nducklings either by mixing it in the mash or by feeding it in a hopper\r\nwhere they can help themselves. The mash feed which is prepared for the\r\nducklings is mixed with water until it has a consistency a little wetter\r\nthan crumbly but not exactly sticky. Sloppy feed should never be used.\r\nAs the ducklings grow older the amount of beef scrap can be increased\r\nuntil it consists of 15% of the ration by the end of the third week. The\r\nproportion of corn meal can likewise be increased and simultaneously the\r\namount of bran decreased until the ducklings are on a fattening ration.\r\nUnless they have a plentiful supply of green feed in the yards to which\r\nthey have access it is necessary to provide this to the extent of about\r\n10% of the feed and it should consist of tender green stuff rather\r\nfinely chopped and mixed in with the mash.\r\n\r\nAbout 2 weeks before the ducklings are to be marketed they should be put\r\non a ration consisting of three parts by weight of corn meal, two parts\r\nlow-grade flour or middlings, one part bran, one-half part beef scrap,\r\n10% green feed and about 3% oyster shell or sand. This mash is fed three\r\ntimes daily. Another ration which can be used for fattening purposes\r\nconsists of 3 parts corn meal, 1 part low-grade wheat flour, 1 part\r\nbran, 5% beef scrap and 3% oyster shell with green feed and grit in\r\naddition.\r\n\r\nWhere fish is available it can be substituted for the beef scrap but on\r\nmost farms this is impractical. The fish where fed is boiled and mixed\r\nin the mash. However, no fish should be fed up to within 2 weeks before\r\nthe ducks are killed as there is danger of giving a fishy taste to the\r\ncarcass. For additional information as to feeding methods used on\r\ncommercial duck farms which could be utilized to advantage for the farm\r\nflocks, see Chapter VI.\r\n\r\nBirds which are to be reserved for breeders should be selected out and\r\ntaken away from the ducklings which are to be fattened. These breeding\r\nbirds should be carried along on the ration which they have been\r\nreceiving until about December 1 when they should be put on a laying\r\nration.\r\n\r\nIt is very necessary to see that the ducklings have a plentiful supply\r\nof drinking water. It is especially important to renew this supply just\r\nbefore the ducklings are fed so that they will have ample water while\r\nthey are consuming their feed. The water should be given in dishes deep\r\nenough so that the ducks can immerse their entire bill as this enables\r\nthem to wash the sand out of their nostrils.\r\n\r\n_Water for Ducklings._ In addition to the drinking water provided duck\r\nraisers sometimes allow the growing ducklings access to water in which\r\nthey can swim. If it is desired to fatten the ducklings quickly and turn\r\nthem off on the market as green ducks many raisers do not consider this\r\nadvisable as it induces the ducklings to take more exercise and makes it\r\nmore difficult to fatten them. However, access to water in which they\r\ncan swim makes it unnecessary to provide any other supply of drinking\r\nwater and for this reason lessens the work considerably. Unless it is\r\neasy for the ducklings to get in and out of the water there is danger of\r\nsome of them drowning as they are likely to get tired and unable to\r\nclimb out. Little ducklings allowed access to very cold water are\r\nsubject to cramp and may be drowned as a result.\r\n\r\n_Distinguishing the Sexes._ It is difficult to distinguish the sexes of\r\ngrowing ducks until they begin to reach maturity. There is, however, a\r\ndifference in their appearance. The drakes are coarser or thicker and\r\nmore masculine in appearance showing this especially about the head and\r\nneck. Also as they secure their mature plumage the drake shows curled\r\nfeathers on top of the tail which are often referred to as sex feathers.\r\nIn addition, the voice of the duck is harsher and coarser than that of\r\nthe drake.\r\n\r\n_Marketing the Ducks._ Most of the ducks produced on farms are marketed\r\nalive. This is because the farmer has no special market and he does not\r\nfind that it pays him to dress and ship the ducks with the chance that\r\nthey might spoil. In fact, most of the farm raised ducks are not turned\r\noff as green ducks at 10 to 12 weeks as is done on the commercial duck\r\nplants but are held until fall and then sold as spring ducks. They will\r\nweigh somewhat more at that time but as a rule the price received per\r\npound will be lower than that obtained for green ducks during the spring\r\nand summer. Where there is a special demand for ducklings which the\r\nfarmer can supply it will pay him to dress and deliver the ducks. If it\r\nis desired to dress the ducks, the directions given under Chapter VII\r\ncan be modified to suit the farmer's needs. The soft body feathers\r\nshould be saved in accordance with the directions given on page 106, as\r\nthey can be used at home in making pillows or can be sold.\r\n\r\nSuch eggs as are produced in surplus may either be utilized on the home\r\ntable or sent to market. As a rule duck eggs are not in great demand\r\nexcept at certain seasons such as at Easter and during the Jewish\r\nholidays in the spring and fall when they bring somewhat higher prices\r\nthan hens' eggs. The larger size of duck eggs, however, makes them\r\nfavored by bakers and they can usually be sold at any time in a city of\r\nany size at prices as good as those received for hens' eggs.\r\n\r\nEggs for market can be packed in the ordinary 30-dozen hen egg cases by\r\nusing special fillers which hold 25 eggs instead of 36 as in the case of\r\nhens' eggs. See page 119. A farmer with a small flock of ducks will\r\nusually not have eggs enough to fill a case frequently and for this\r\nreason he usually finds it more convenient to market the few eggs he has\r\nby taking them into town in a basket.\r\n\r\n_Disease and Insect Pests._ Ducks are very little troubled by insect\r\npests, nor are they greatly troubled by diseases. The usual difficulties\r\nencountered along this line are those discussed under this head in\r\nChapter VI. Losses are often experienced as the result of predatory\r\nanimals. Rats will cause a great amount of havoc among the young ducks\r\nif they are able to get at them. A single night's work on the part of\r\none rat may practically clean out a small flock of ducklings. It is\r\nnecessary to make sure that the ducklings are shut in at night so that\r\nrats cannot get at them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEESE\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nExtent of the Industry--Opportunities\r\n\r\n\r\nGeese can be raised successfully in practically all parts of the United\r\nStates and are in fact scattered in small flocks over a considerable\r\nportion of the country being most abundant in the South and in the\r\nMiddle West.\r\n\r\nThe census figures for the year 1920 show Illinois with 195,769 geese to\r\nbe the leading state in numbers, closely followed by Missouri, Arkansas\r\nand Iowa. Next in order of importance as goose raising states come\r\nKentucky, Tennessee, Minnesota, North Carolina and Texas. The census\r\nfigures of 1920 compared with those for 1910 show a decrease in the\r\nnumber of geese from 4,431,980 to 2,939,203. The only groups of states\r\nwhich showed an increase in the number of geese during this period were\r\nthe North Atlantic and the Mountain states. Of the total farms in the\r\nUnited States only a small proportion, probably one-tenth, have any\r\ngeese and the number of geese per farm would not average over 4 to 10\r\ndepending on the section.\r\n\r\n_Nature of the Industry._ Geese are kept almost wholly in small flocks\r\nas a side line on general farms. The purpose of goose raising is\r\nprimarily one of the production of meat although in the past flocks of\r\ngeese have been kept to some extent, particularly in the south for the\r\npurpose of plucking them to secure the feathers. This practice of\r\nplucking live geese is decreasing and is much less common than formerly.\r\nThe eggs of the geese do not enter to any extent into the egg trade of\r\nthe country. As a rule all the eggs produced are hatched for the purpose\r\nof rearing young geese and it is only occasionally that goose eggs are\r\nused for culinary purposes.\r\n\r\n_Opportunities for Goose Raising._ Undoubtedly the greatest opportunity\r\nalong the line of goose raising lies in the small flock kept on the\r\ngeneral farm. Where conditions are suitable, that is to say, where there\r\nis an abundance of suitable pasture land together with some water to\r\nwhich the geese can have access, a small flock can be most profitably\r\nkept. They can be reared very cheaply as both the young and old geese\r\nwill secure practically their entire living during the summer from\r\npasture if an abundant supply of suitable green material is available.\r\nThe cost of rearing them therefore is low. In addition both the young\r\nand old geese are very hardy and require comparatively little care. They\r\nare little subject to disease and therefore losses are small.\r\n\r\nGeese live and breed for a long time and this makes it possible to turn\r\noff to market a larger proportion of the young stock reared than is the\r\ncase with most other classes of poultry. For all of these reasons,\r\ntherefore, a small flock of geese will return a good profit to the\r\nfarmer without having to supply any great amount of equipment or without\r\nhaving to feed very much in the way of expensive feeds. In addition to\r\nthe geese which can be marketed, the maintenance of a small flock also\r\nhelps to provide a variety in the farmer's diet by furnishing suitable\r\nbirds for the holiday seasons such as Thanksgiving and Christmas.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the opportunity for goose raising in small flocks on\r\ngeneral farms there likewise exists a definite opportunity to specialize\r\nalong this line somewhat more extensively. In certain places, notably\r\nthe state of Wisconsin, goose raising becomes a more important activity\r\non some farms than merely that of a by-product. Larger numbers are\r\nreared and special steps are taken in fattening and finishing them for\r\nmarket either by means of pen fattening or by means of hand fattening or\r\nnoodling the geese. Geese so finished for market bring a special price\r\nand allow a good profit to the raiser for the time which he has put into\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAn outgrowth of the goose raising industry which has been worked to a\r\nlimited extent consists of the gathering together of the geese raised in\r\nany particular portion of the country on one farm and the feeding of\r\nthem there in large flocks in the fields so as to fatten them for\r\nmarket. There are not many of these special fattening farms but several\r\npersons in different sections of the country who have made a practice\r\nof gathering together and marketing the geese in this way have found it\r\nvery profitable. Probably a similar opportunity exists in certain other\r\nsections where goose raising on the farms in small numbers is common and\r\nwhere no one has yet made the effort to collect and fatten the geese\r\nbefore marketing them.\r\n\r\nWhile geese are not exhibited to the same extent as chickens, still\r\nthere will always be found a market for birds of good quality, both for\r\nthe purpose of exhibition and also as breeders to be used in improving\r\nthe stock of other goose raisers.\r\n\r\n_Goose Raising as a Business for Farm Women._ Like turkey raising goose\r\nraising as a side line on the farm offers an excellent money making\r\nopportunity for the farm women. Without any great outlay of capital to\r\nget a start and without its being necessary to provide much in the way\r\nof buildings or other equipment, a flock of geese can be started which\r\nwill allow a nice profit to the farm woman for the care and attention\r\nwhich she gives them. In this connection it should be remembered that\r\nwhile the opportunities for profit may not be so large as in turkey\r\nraising, yet the care required is much less and the chances of serious\r\ndifficulties due to disease and to inability to raise the young stock\r\nare relatively small. Goose raising therefore offers a most profitable\r\nside line employment for the farm woman.\r\n\r\n_Geese as Weed Destroyers._ As stated before geese are close grazers. In\r\nfact, during the growing season of the year green vegetation forms most\r\nand in some cases practically all of their diet. The vegetation which\r\nthey will eat readily is quite varied and in many cases geese will be\r\nfound to be very valuable in ridding pastures or fields of troublesome\r\nweeds. In the southern states geese are often kept on farms where cotton\r\nis raised for the purpose of keeping the cotton fields free from weeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nObjection to Geese\r\n\r\nAn objection to geese often expressed but without good foundation is\r\nthat they will spoil the pasture for other stock. This is not true if\r\nthe pasture is not overstocked with geese. Of course geese are very\r\nclose grazers and if too many of them are kept on a field they will eat\r\nthe grass down so close that there will be none for other animals to\r\nget. Similarly the idea that other animals will not eat grass grown\r\nwhere goose droppings have fallen is not true except where the birds are\r\ntoo thick so that the grass is soiled badly by the droppings.\r\n\r\nThe fact that geese are noisy creatures makes them undesirable to some\r\npersons. It is true that they make a good deal of noise and that their\r\ncry is of a very hoarse, rasping character and to a person with bad\r\nnerves they may be annoying but this is no valid or weighty objection to\r\nthe normal, healthy farmer. The Chinese geese are the noisiest and\r\nconsequently the greatest offenders in this particular.\r\n\r\nA more valid objection to geese lies in the fact of their rather ugly\r\ndisposition. Ganders, especially as they grow older and during the\r\nbreeding season, are decidedly pugnacious and will not hesitate to\r\nattack human beings. They strike heavy formidable blows with their wings\r\nand with their strong bills they inflict most painful bites. Where there\r\nare children about the house it may be necessary to dispose of ugly\r\nganders to safeguard the children from serious injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nBreeds and Varieties--How to Mate to Produce Exhibition\r\nSpecimens--Preparing Geese for the Show--Catching and Handling\r\n\r\n\r\n_Breeds of Geese._ There are six standard breeds of geese consisting of\r\nthe following: Toulouse, Embden, African, Chinese, Wild or Canadian and\r\nEgyptian. All of these breeds consist of a single variety with the\r\nexception of the Chinese which is composed of two. The Toulouse is known\r\nas the Gray Toulouse, the Embden as the White Embden, the African as the\r\nGray African, the two varieties of the Chinese as the Brown Chinese and\r\nthe White Chinese, the Wild or Canadian as the Gray and the Egyptian as\r\nthe Colored.\r\n\r\nThe first four of these breeds are the ones which are commonly kept in\r\ndomestication. In a general way it may be said that these breeds are\r\nmeat breeds for the reason that they are kept mainly for the production\r\nof meat. The Wild or Canadian and the Egyptian are more in the nature of\r\nornamental breeds since they are not so commonly kept and are\r\nprincipally to be found where ornamental water-fowls are maintained. The\r\nChinese are sometimes classed as ornamental geese on account of their\r\nsmaller size but they are much more commonly kept than either the\r\nCanadian or the Egyptian and make a good market fowl where the demand is\r\nnot for such a large carcass.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the standard breeds there are several other rare breeds\r\namong which is the Sebastapol which is kept purely as an ornamental\r\nbreed by reason of its peculiar feathering. The Sebastapol is a white\r\ngoose in which the feathers of the upper part of the body show a twisted\r\nor frizzled condition which gives it much the general effect of the\r\nfeathers being curled. In addition to the standard breeds of geese there\r\nare kept on a great majority of farms ordinary common geese of no\r\ndefinite breed or variety. These geese in general are of smaller size\r\nthan the larger standard breeds and have probably arisen as the result\r\nof the crossing of the standard breeds and the subsequent deterioration\r\nin size and color marking is due to careless breeding and selection.\r\n\r\nIn some sections and for certain special purposes definite crosses of\r\nstandard breeds are made for the production of table geese having\r\ncertain desired qualities. For this purpose the African ganders are very\r\npopular used upon the Toulouse geese. To some extent there is produced\r\nand marketed a goose known as the mongrel goose. This has excellent\r\ntable quality and is in good demand on account of its superior eating\r\nqualities and its rapid growth. It is produced by using the Wild or\r\nCanadian gander upon Toulouse, African or Embden geese. The result of\r\nthis cross is a hybrid goose which has much the appearance of the Wild\r\ngoose but which will not breed although the females will lay eggs. As a\r\nrule Toulouse or African females are used for the cross rather than\r\nEmbden as from the latter there is a greater tendency to get a lighter\r\ncross which would not resemble its Wild father so closely and might not\r\ntherefore be so readily recognized as genuine mongrel geese.\r\n\r\n_Nomenclature._ The term geese is used to indicate the birds of both\r\nsexes taken as a whole and also as a plural form for the word goose. The\r\nterm goose is used to distinguish the female of the species. The male is\r\ngiven the specific name of gander to distinguish it from goose. The\r\nyoung of both sexes are termed goslings. In giving the standard weights\r\nfor the different breeds of geese the birds are classified as adult\r\nganders and young ganders and as adult geese and young geese. By adult\r\ngoose or gander is meant a bird which is over one year old, by young\r\ngoose or gander is meant a bird which is less than one year. Not\r\ninfrequently in connection with market reports use will be made of the\r\nterm \"green geese\". This indicates birds which are marketed when they\r\nare of large size but still young and immature, the green referring to\r\nthis immature condition.\r\n\r\n_Size._ An idea of the size of the different standard breeds of geese\r\ncan best be secured by giving the standard weights. They are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nBreed             Adult   Adult     Young   Young\r\n                 Gander   Goose    Gander   Goose\r\n\r\nToulouse         26 lbs.  20 lbs.  20 lbs.  16 lbs.\r\nEmbden           20  \"    18  \"    18  \"    16  \"\r\nAfrican          20  \"    18  \"    16  \"    14  \"\r\nChinese          12  \"    10  \"    10  \"     8  \"\r\nWild or Canadian 12  \"    10  \"    10  \"     8  \"\r\nEgyptian         10  \"     8  \"     8  \"     6  \"\r\n\r\n_Popularity of the Breeds_. Of the different standard breeds kept the\r\nToulouse is undoubtedly the most popular in this country probably due to\r\nits large size as well as to its quick growth. The Embden follows the\r\nToulouse closely in popularity. The Chinese geese are probably third\r\nmost numerous in numbers while the African ranks fourth. In certain\r\nsections the African seems to be very popular and one would expect to\r\nfind more of this breed than seem to be present on farms. Neither the\r\nCanadian nor the Egyptians are to be found in any great numbers, the\r\nlatter in particular being very rare.\r\n\r\n\r\nEgg Production\r\n\r\nIt must always be remembered in speaking of the egg production of any\r\nbreed of poultry that there will be a considerable variation in\r\nindividuals within a breed and that egg production will also be affected\r\nvery largely by the conditions under which the birds are kept. For this\r\nreason any attempt to give an average egg production for a breed is at\r\nbest only an approximation. These approximations often serve, however,\r\nto show some well established contrast between the different breeds with\r\nrespect to their egg laying ability. The Toulouse is a fairly prolific\r\nbreed of geese and individuals should average from 12 to 36 eggs, the\r\nmajority laying about 20 eggs. The Embden is very similar to the\r\nToulouse in laying ability although probably on the whole not quite so\r\ngood a layer. The African is generally considered a good layer and is\r\nsaid to average from 20 to 40 eggs. Some breeders state that the pure\r\nAfrican are not as good layers as this, being about equal to the Embden\r\nand that the better laying Africans really have some Brown Chinese blood\r\nin them which has been introduced to increase prolificacy. The Chinese\r\nis the most prolific breed. The birds of either the White or Brown\r\nvariety should average from 60 to 100 eggs. The eggs laid by the Chinese\r\nare smaller than those of the Toulouse, Embden or African. The Wild or\r\nCanadian and the Egyptian geese are small layers. They rarely lay more\r\nthan one sitting during a season and the eggs will as a rule range from\r\n4 to 8 in number.\r\n\r\n_Size of Goose Eggs._ Goose eggs are decidedly larger than duck eggs.\r\nThere is a considerable variation in size, depending upon the breed. The\r\neggs of the Toulouse, African and Embden are of about the same size and\r\nwill vary from 6-1/2 to 8 ounces each. The eggs of the Chinese are smaller\r\nand will weigh from 5-1/2 to 6 ounces each, while eggs of the Canadian and\r\nEgyptian are the smallest of the standard breeds, running from 5 to 5-1/2\r\nounces each.\r\n\r\n_Color of Goose Eggs._ In general goose eggs are whitish in color but\r\nmay shade to a gray or buff tinge. The Wild or Canadian sometimes lay\r\neggs which are off the white, showing a considerable green tinge.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Geese and Matings\r\n\r\n_Broodiness._ All of the breeds of geese with the exception of the\r\nToulouse may be classed as broody breeds, that is to say, they will make\r\ntheir nests and hatch their young if given a chance to do so. Not\r\ninfrequently individuals of the Toulouse breed will do this also but as\r\na rule they are not dependable for this purpose.\r\n\r\n_Size of Mating._ In making the mating it is usual in order to secure\r\nbest results to use one gander with from two to four geese in the\r\nToulouse, Embden and African breeds. In fact, better results will be\r\nsecured in these breeds where not over 3 geese are used and in many\r\ncases the geese are mated in trios or even in pairs. In the Chinese\r\ngeese a somewhat larger mating can be employed, one gander being used\r\nwith 4 to 6 geese. The Wild or Canadian and the Egyptian geese in most\r\ncases pair only.\r\n\r\n_Age of Breeders._ Geese can be retained and will give good results as\r\nbreeders for a longer period than most other classes of poultry. While\r\nthe young geese will often lay during their first year the results from\r\nthe eggs produced by them are not as a rule very satisfactory. It is\r\nsometimes claimed that the eggs of young geese will not hatch but this\r\nis untrue and goslings have been raised from such eggs. Canadian and\r\nEgyptian geese do not lay until they are 3 years old. Females may be\r\nkept for breeding purposes until they are 8 to 10 years old and should\r\ngive good results during this time. If they continue to lay longer than\r\nthis and are valuable breeding individuals they should of course be\r\nretained just so long as they lay at a profitable rate. Instances are\r\nreported where geese 15 to 20 years old were still giving good results\r\nas breeders. As a rule ganders cannot be successfully kept for breeding\r\npurposes as long as can the geese. Yearling ganders are often used but\r\nthey are at their best for breeding purposes when from 3 to 5 years old\r\nand it is not generally wise to retain them after they are 6 or 7 years\r\nold. Egyptian and Canadian ganders will not breed before they are 2\r\nyears old. In general it is good practice to mate young ganders to older\r\ngeese and to mate younger geese with older ganders as this seems to get\r\nbetter results both in fertility and in hatching.\r\n\r\n_Marking Young Geese._ It is often desirable to mark young geese in some\r\nway so that their breeding can be told or so that a record can be kept\r\nof their age. This can be readily accomplished by punching various\r\ncombinations of holes in the webs between the toes at the time the\r\ngoslings are hatched.\r\n\r\n_Considerations in Making the Mating._[4] In making the mating in\r\nbreeding geese it must be kept in mind that it is of primary importance\r\nto select the breeders first of all for size, prolificacy and vitality.\r\nWithout these qualities no matter what else the breeding geese may be\r\nthere is scant chance of satisfactory results. Having selected birds\r\nwhich are of suitable size and vitality those should then be utilized\r\nfor breeding which approach most nearly both in type and color to the\r\nrequirements as given in the American Standard of Perfection. As a rule,\r\na new mating can be made by taking the birds selected and shutting them\r\nup together in a pen away from the other birds and out of sound of the\r\nvoices of their former mates. As a rule about a month of this treatment\r\nwill suffice to bring about the new matings desired and the birds can\r\nthen be allowed to range at liberty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: For a more detailed description of the principles of\r\nbreeding as applied to poultry and which is equally applicable to geese,\r\nthe reader is referred to \"The Mating and Breeding of Poultry\" by Harry\r\nM. Lamon and Rob R. Slocum, published by the Orange Judd Publishing Co.,\r\nNew York, N. Y.]\r\n\r\nSome ganders are very troublesome about mating. This is particularly\r\ntrue as they get older. In some cases it is impossible to get ganders to\r\nmate at all while frequently they will refuse to mate with more than one\r\ngoose. As a rule, matings once made are permanent from year to year\r\nunless changed by the breeder on account of poor results. Where new\r\nmatings are to be made or where changes are to be made this should be\r\ndone in the fall so that the birds will have been mated for several\r\nmonths before the breeding season begins in order to insure good\r\nresults. After the matings are made the geese can be allowed to run\r\ntogether in larger flocks but the practice is frequently employed of\r\nkeeping the different matings in pens to themselves so as to avoid the\r\nfighting which will otherwise occur between the ganders. During the\r\nbreeding season the ganders are quite savage and will fight fiercely.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreeds of Geese[5]\r\n\r\n_The Toulouse._ This breed is characterized by its very low down deep\r\nbroad massive body. The body should come well down in front and should\r\nbe so deep and full behind that it tends to drag on the ground when the\r\nbird walks. The skin of the rear portion of the body should have folds.\r\nThe appearance or type of the Toulouse depends a great deal upon the\r\ncondition of flesh which a bird may be in at the time as a fat well\r\nfleshed condition will improve type very materially. A dewlap, that is\r\nto say, a pendulous flap of skin on the throat, is desired but\r\ncomparatively few birds show a well developed dewlap. It is more likely\r\nto appear with age than it is in the younger birds. In color the\r\nToulouse breeds quite true. The principal difficulty which is\r\nencountered is the occasional appearance of one, two or three white\r\nflight feathers in the wing. These white flights constitute a\r\ndisqualification and must of course be avoided in the breeding. It is\r\nnecessary also to avoid any birds which lack in size, length, breadth or\r\ndepth of body, particularly depth in front. Birds of this breed are of\r\nlarge size and make quick growth and for this reason are a fine market\r\ngoose although the dark colored pin feathers are somewhat of a drawback\r\nfrom a market point of view.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: For a complete and official description and list of\r\ndisqualifications of the standard breeds and varieties of geese, the\r\nreader is referred to the American Standard of Perfection published by\r\nthe American Poultry Association, obtainable from Orange Judd Publishing\r\nCompany, New York, N. Y.]\r\n\r\n_The Embden._ This breed is of good size but somewhat smaller than the\r\nToulouse. It has not quite so long a keel or underline as the Toulouse\r\nand while deep in body it is not so baggy. There should be no dewlap in\r\nthis breed. The plumage should be pure white throughout, the only\r\ndifficulty of any importance occurring here being the occasional\r\nappearance of slate on the backs of young geese. This, however, is not\r\nserious as it almost invariably disappears with the first moult. Embden\r\ngeese are rapid growers and mature early which together with the fact\r\nthat their plumage is white makes them an excellent market bird.\r\n\r\n_The African._ In type the African is much the same as the Toulouse\r\nalthough not quite as large being about the size of the Embden. What is\r\ndesired is a low down body which is flat in keel and without any folds\r\nof skin. The neck should be short. This bird unlike the Toulouse is\r\ncharacterized by a knob or protuberance extending out from the head at\r\nthe base of the upper bill. This knob should be black in color and\r\nshould show no tinge of yellow on the top or about the base. If the knob\r\ngets scarred or injured it is apt to turn yellow and freezing likewise\r\nis apt to cause it to turn yellow. Birds of this breed both young and\r\nold should show dewlaps, the absence of these in adult specimens\r\nconstituting a disqualification. As in the Toulouse avoid any white\r\nflight feathers. The African makes an excellent market goose being like\r\nthe Embden and Toulouse, quick growing and early maturing. The ganders\r\nare especially in favor for use in crossing with other varieties for the\r\nproduction of market geese. It seems probable that some Brown Chinese\r\nblood has been crossed into the Africans on various occasions probably\r\nfor the purpose of increasing the prolificacy of the African as the\r\nBrown Chinese is an excellent layer. It is also true that crosses\r\nbetween the Brown Chinese and the Toulouse are sometimes shown for\r\nAfricans but as a rule this cross results in too dark a bird and such\r\ncrosses should never be used for breeding purposes since they would not\r\ncontinue to give the uniformity and other qualities obtained in the\r\nfirst generation.\r\n\r\n_The Chinese._ The Chinese is quite different in type from the three\r\npreceding breeds. It is much smaller and higher set on legs and has a\r\nbody much more upright in carriage. The neck is long and slender and the\r\nhead has a large knob. An important part about the type is to secure a\r\nvery slender neck, another important point being to secure a very large\r\nknob; the larger this is the better. There is, however, a decided\r\ntendency for the knob to run small when the neck is slender and it is\r\ndifficult to secure in perfection the combination of a very slender neck\r\nand a large knob. The Chinese geese should be in good condition but\r\nshould not be too fat when shown as too good a condition of flesh\r\ninjures the type materially. If fat there is a decided tendency for the\r\nbirds to bag down behind which is undesirable. The Chinese geese are the\r\nbest layers but the egg which they lay is smaller. On account of their\r\nsmaller size they do not make as good market geese where large sized\r\ncarcasses are desired but where smaller carcasses suitable for family\r\nuse are in demand the Chinese make a satisfactory market breed.\r\n\r\n_The Brown Chinese._ In this variety the knob should be dark brown or\r\nblack. As in the African, injury or freezing may turn the knob yellow\r\nwhich is undesirable. The plumage should be a rich brown shade of color,\r\na faded gray color being very undesirable. The stripe down the back of\r\nthe neck should be well defined and should be distinctly in contrast\r\nwith the rest of the neck color. White feathers in the primaries or\r\nsecondaries must be avoided.\r\n\r\n_The White Chinese._ The knob in this variety should be orange and any\r\ntendency toward yellow should be avoided. The plumage should be pure\r\nwhite throughout. Occasional young females may show slate in the back\r\nbut this is not serious as it almost invariably disappears with the\r\nfirst moult.\r\n\r\n_The Wild or Canadian._ Contrary to expectation this breed when\r\ndomesticated is very peaceable and very tame. There is often, however, a\r\ntendency for them to grow uneasy when the migratory season comes. To\r\nkeep the birds from flying away it is necessary to clip the flight\r\nfeathers of one wing or what is safer still to pinion the bird.\r\nPinioning consists of cutting off the first joint of one wing. This may\r\nbe done when the birds are small or may be done at any time and does not\r\nseem to bother them much. One of the best ways to accomplish this is to\r\nbreak the joint and then cut it off by using a chisel and hammer. Not\r\nmuch bleeding will result but it is well to put a little iodine on the\r\ncut. These birds breed very true in type and color and progress in the\r\nmating simply consists of continuing to select those birds for breeders\r\nwhich show markings in the greatest excellence. In type a Canadian goose\r\nis quite different from that of the other breeds mentioned. It is\r\nsmaller, set much higher on legs and its body is neater and trimmer, and\r\nis oblong and carried in a horizontal position. The neck is long and\r\nslender. These birds mate only in pairs as a rule and the females do not\r\nmature and lay until they are three years old. The ganders often breed\r\nwhen they are two years old. Usually only a single sitting of eggs is\r\nlaid consisting of from 4 to 8. Usually, however, all of these eggs will\r\nhatch and the young prove to be strong and easily reared.\r\n\r\n_The Egyptian._ This is the smallest of the standard breeds of geese. In\r\ntype it more nearly approaches the Canadian than any other breed but it\r\nis somewhat longer in legs, showing more of the thigh beneath the body.\r\nThe body is not carried in quite such a horizontal position as the\r\nCanadian but slopes downward slightly from the breast to the tail. The\r\nneck is neither so long nor quite so slender as that of the Canadian.\r\nThis breed is the brightest colored of any of the geese and breeds\r\nfairly true in color and markings. Like the Canadian the Egyptian goose\r\nis likely to become uneasy at times and one wing should therefore be\r\npinioned or the flight feathers clipped to keep the birds from flying\r\naway. Like the Canadian the Egyptians mate in pairs only and lay but one\r\nsitting during the year. The females do not lay until they are three\r\nyears old.\r\n\r\nNeither the Egyptian nor the Canadian geese should be closely confined\r\nor no eggs will be laid. The goose should be allowed to make her own\r\nnest and hatch her eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50. Left--Egyptian Gander.

Right--White Chinese\r\nGander. (_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPreparing Geese for the Show\r\n\r\nThe preparation of geese for the show is comparatively a simple matter.\r\nIt requires first of all that individuals shall be selected which\r\napproach nearest to the standard requirements both in type and in color.\r\nAs to the actual preparation for exhibition the geese are practically\r\nself-prepared. For a period of at least a week or ten days before they\r\nare shipped to the show they should be given access to a grass range and\r\nto running water. The grass range tends to put them in good condition\r\nwhile the running water will give them an opportunity to clean\r\nthemselves. Any broken feathers should be plucked at least six weeks\r\nbefore the birds are to be shown so as to give them an opportunity to\r\ngrow in new ones.\r\n\r\nSince all of the common breeds of geese, with the exception of the\r\nChinese, should be shown in a fat condition in order to give them their\r\nbest type they should be given a grain mixture twice daily for a period\r\nof at least ten days before the show in order to get them in good flesh\r\nand to bring them up to standard weight. This ration should consist of\r\none part corn and two parts oats. In Chinese geese where it is desired\r\nto have them in good condition of flesh but without showing any tendency\r\ntoward bagginess, oats alone should be fed as they are apt to put on too\r\nmuch fat when corn is fed as well. When the birds are shipped to the\r\nshow they are quite likely to get their plumage soiled during the\r\njourney. If this occurs fill a barrel about half full of water. As the\r\ngeese are taken from the shipping coops place two of them at a time in\r\nthe barrel, cover it over and leave them for a few minutes. Then take\r\nthem out and they will usually be clean.\r\n\r\n\r\nCatching and Handling Geese\r\n\r\nNever catch geese by the legs which are weak and are easily broken or\r\ninjured. For the same reason they should never be carried by the legs.\r\nIn catching geese grasp them by the neck just below the head. Often a\r\ncrooked stick is of value in getting hold of the birds by the neck.\r\nGeese can be carried short distances by the neck without injury but it\r\nis not advisable to carry them for any considerable distance in this\r\nmanner, particularly if they are fat. The best way to handle the geese\r\nis to catch them by the neck, then place one arm over the shoulders and\r\naround the bird's body thus holding the wings in place while both legs\r\nare grasped with the hand. The neck should be held with the other hand\r\nto keep the bird from biting. In releasing the bird in a pen or shipping\r\ncoop do not let go of the neck until the bird is placed where it is\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54--Proper manner of picking up and carrying geese\r\nwith the head and neck under the arm. (_Photographs from the Bureau of\r\nAnimal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPacking and Shipping Hatching Eggs\r\n\r\nGoose eggs for hatching must be shipped when they are fresh if they are\r\nto be received in good condition and are to give good results in\r\nhatching. They can be shipped long distances either by express or by\r\nparcel post. In order to prevent breakage and to lessen the effects of\r\nthe jar to which the eggs are subjected during shipment they should be\r\ncarefully packed in a market basket or other suitable receptacle. The\r\nsame method of packing the eggs should be employed as with duck eggs\r\ndescribed on page 137.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrices for Breeding Stock\r\n\r\nWhile the demand for breeding stock is not so broad with geese as it is\r\nwith some other classes of poultry, there does exist a steady and\r\nprofitable demand for this class of fowls. Goose eggs for hatching are\r\nusually sold in sittings of 5 and the price varies somewhat depending\r\nupon the variety. As a rule, Embden and Toulouse eggs will bring from 60\r\ncents to $1.20 each. Chinese goose eggs will bring from 40 cents to $1\r\neach while the eggs of the African goose will bring from $1 to $2 each.\r\nOf course the price of eggs for hatching like that of breeding birds\r\ndepends on the quality of the stock. The prices for the birds themselves\r\nfor breeding purposes will run anywhere from about $8 to $10 apiece for\r\ngood birds suitable for breeding on farm flocks, to $25 or even $50 each\r\nof birds of especially fine quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nManagement of Breeding Geese\r\n\r\n\r\n_Range for Breeders._ Since grass or other vegetation, when plentiful,\r\nwill furnish practically the entire living both for breeding and growing\r\ngeese, it is by all means desirable to have suitable range for the\r\nbreeding stock. Aside from economy of production range is desirable from\r\nthe fact that the breeders keep in better condition and better results\r\nin breeding and fertility are obtained. The range for breeding geese\r\nshould therefore consist of grass land or pasture. Often rather low wet\r\nland can be used for this purpose, particularly if some higher land is\r\nalso available to provide a more favorable kind of grass. Often geese\r\ncan be ranged on the same pasture with horses or cattle. Later in the\r\nseason after the harvest, both breeding and growing geese can be given\r\nthe range of the stubble fields to good advantage as they will glean\r\nmost of the shelled grain. The entire flock of breeders is generally\r\nallowed to run together but the flock may be divided if desired, or each\r\nmating may be kept in a colony by itself if the fighting of the ganders\r\nproves troublesome.\r\n\r\n_Number of Geese to the Acre._ The number of geese which can be kept or\r\nrun to the acre depends of course upon the nature of the land available\r\nfor the purpose. The better the pasture and therefore the more green\r\nfeed available throughout the summer and fall, the more geese can be\r\nrun. In general, the practice is to run from 4 to 25 geese to an acre;\r\nten is a fair average under normal conditions.\r\n\r\n_Water for Breeding Geese._ While water to which the geese can have\r\naccess for swimming is not absolutely essential for their well being,\r\nthey like it and it is well to provide water if possible especially\r\nduring the breeding season. It not only takes care of the problem of\r\nsupplying drinking water, but in the opinion of many goose raisers,\r\nincreases the fertility of the eggs laid. A natural water supply such as\r\na stream or pond in the pasture is therefore desirable, but if none is\r\navailable an artificial pond or tank can be furnished to good advantage.\r\n\r\n_Distinguishing the Sex._ It is difficult to distinguish the sex of\r\ngeese. It is, of course, necessary to know the sex so as to provide the\r\nproper number of ganders and so as to know what birds to pen together in\r\nmaking a mating. Once the sex of a bird is determined it is well for the\r\nnovice to mark it by means of a suitable leg band so that its sex can be\r\neasily distinguished in the future.\r\n\r\nIt is more difficult to distinguish the sex of young than of old geese.\r\nThe gander is generally slightly larger and coarser than the goose, with\r\na longer, thicker neck and larger head. The gander also has a shriller\r\ncry than the goose whose cry consists of a harsher sound. Some goose\r\nraisers claim that they can distinguish the sex of mature geese by the\r\nbody shape, the underline of the body of the gander from the tail to the\r\npoint where the legs join the body being nearly straight, while in the\r\ngoose this line tends to round out with the fuller development of the\r\nabdomen. This difference is more marked during the laying season than at\r\nother times. Considerable experience is necessary in order to\r\ndistinguish sex by any of the means described and the really sure way is\r\nby an examination of the sexual organs or by observing the actions of\r\nthe geese when mating.\r\n\r\nUpon examination the sphincter muscle which closes the anus of the\r\nfemale when stretched will be found to have a folded appearance. If the\r\ngander is placed upon his back and pressure applied around the anus, the\r\npenis will protrude. This test is more easily made on a mature than on\r\nan immature gander and is also easier to make during warm than during\r\ncold weather.\r\n\r\n_Purchase of Breeding Stock._ Geese when mated usually stay mated\r\npermanently. Matings are not, therefore, changed from year to year as a\r\nrule so long as they continue to give satisfactory results. If it\r\nbecomes necessary to make new matings or to break up old matings, this\r\nshould be done in the fall, so that the birds will be thoroughly used to\r\nthe new order of things by the time the breeding season arrives, and\r\nthe results in eggs laid and young stock grown will not, therefore, be\r\nadversely affected. For this reason, any breeding stock purchased should\r\nbe secured in the fall rather than to wait until just before the\r\nbreeding season opens. As a rule, also, a better selection of breeding\r\nstock to choose from is available to the purchaser in the fall.\r\n\r\n_Time of Laying._ Geese start laying in the early spring and continue to\r\nlay throughout the spring. With special attention given to the feeding,\r\nthey should begin in the northeastern part of the United States about\r\nFebruary 1 and should continue to lay until about June 1 when geese of\r\nthe heavier breeds such as the Toulouse, African and Embden will\r\ngenerally be pretty well through. Some individuals will lay later than\r\nthis and the Chinese geese also have a rather longer laying season\r\nextending further into the summer. The length of the laying season is\r\nalso affected by whether the geese are broken up when they become broody\r\nor whether they are allowed to sit. The latter practice, of course,\r\nstops the layings. It must be remembered that the Canadian and Egyptian\r\nas a rule lay only a single small setting of eggs during the season.\r\n\r\nAs a rule geese lay during the night or the forenoon. The frequency of\r\nlaying varies, some geese laying every other day while others lay more\r\nor less often.\r\n\r\n_Housing._ Geese withstand the weather very well and do not need much in\r\nthe way of houses or shelter except during winter and during severe\r\nstorms. In the North it is the usual practice and good practice to\r\nprovide shelter for the geese, which may take the form of a poultry\r\nhouse, or of any shed or barn available for the purpose. A shed with\r\nopenings on the south side makes an ideal goose shelter or house. Most\r\nbreeders in the South who give their flocks good attention also provide\r\nshelter for them during the winter although geese are also successfully\r\nkept in that section without shelter.\r\n\r\nThe houses provided for the breeders must be kept clean and as dry as\r\npossible. The best way to do this is to bed them liberally with straw,\r\nshavings or some similar material, especially during the winter. As the\r\nbedding becomes soiled, more should be added and the house should be\r\ncleaned out from time to time and fresh litter put in.\r\n\r\nNo equipment for the houses is necessary. The geese will lay their eggs\r\nin nests which they make on the floor and if plenty of clean bedding is\r\nprovided, the eggs will not get badly soiled. Large boxes, barrels, or\r\nsimilar shelter provided with an abundance of nesting material may be\r\nscattered about the range to provide places in which the geese may make\r\ntheir nests.\r\n\r\n_Yards._ Usually no yards are provided for geese as they are allowed the\r\nrange of a pasture or are allowed to roam at liberty about the farm. Any\r\nordinary woven wire stock fence such as might be used to fence a pasture\r\nwill serve to keep the geese confined as well as the other stock. If\r\nfor any reason it is desired to confine geese to a yard, the effort\r\nshould be made to provide yard enough so that the geese will have a\r\nconstant supply of green feed. In a small yard this is impossible. A 2-1/2\r\nor 3 foot fence is high enough to confine any of the common breeds of\r\ngeese and will also serve for Canadian and Egyptian geese if they have\r\nbeen pinioned which should always be done.\r\n\r\n_Feeding the Breeding Geese._ While the flock of geese may be allowed to\r\npick most of their living from a good grass range during the summer and\r\nfall, it is necessary to feed them during the winter. In fact during the\r\nsummer it may be necessary to feed them lightly on grain or wet mash if\r\nthe pasture gets short. The quantity of feed necessary for this purpose\r\ndepends upon the condition of the pasture and must be judged by the\r\ncondition of the birds.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter, they must be fed regularly. The feed given them\r\nshould consist of both grain and some form of roughage. It is necessary\r\nto be careful not to overfeed so that the geese will become too fat, for\r\nwhile they should be in good condition of flesh at the beginning of the\r\nbreeding season, if they are too fat, poor fertility and poor hatches\r\nwill result.\r\n\r\n_Feed._ Oats makes the best feed for breeding geese as it is not too\r\nfattening. Corn, wheat or barley fed alone is likely to prove too\r\nfattening but a limited quantity should be fed for variety. The grain\r\nshould be fed twice a day throughout the winter and should be given\r\nrather sparingly, depending on roughage to make up the bulk of the feed.\r\nVegetables, clover or alfalfa hay, chopped corn stover or silage make\r\ngood roughage for this purpose. Corn silage is a fine feed if it is not\r\nmoldy and does not contain so much corn as to be too fattening.\r\n\r\nAbout three weeks or a month before it is desired to have the geese\r\ncommence laying, which should be at such a time that the first goslings\r\nhatched will have good grass pasture, a mash should be added to the feed\r\nto stimulate egg production. This mash is generally fed in the morning\r\nwith the vegetables or roughage and may consist of three parts bran or\r\nshorts, one part corn meal and one-fourth part meat scrap. If available\r\nbuttermilk or skim milk can be used to mix the mash and replace the meat\r\nscrap. Another mash for this purpose consists of corn meal one-fourth\r\npart, bran two parts, and ground oats one part, mixed up with skim milk\r\nor buttermilk.\r\n\r\nGrit and oyster shell should be kept where the geese can help themselves\r\nparticularly during the laying season. Drinking water must be available\r\nat all times and if a natural supply is not available, must be given in\r\ndrinking fountains or dishes which should be so arranged that the geese\r\ncannot get their feet into the water. When they can get into the\r\ndrinking water, they will quickly get it into a filthy condition.\r\n\r\nWhen the geese are running in a field with horses or cattle a small\r\nenclosure should be fenced in to which the geese can gain access by\r\nmeans of suitable openings but which will keep the other stock out. In\r\nthis should be placed the drinking fountain for the geese and in this\r\nenclosure the geese should be fed. Otherwise the cattle or horses will\r\nget most of the feed intended for the geese and in addition, some of the\r\ngeese may be stepped on or kicked and injured when the stock crowds\r\naround at feeding time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nIncubation\r\n\r\n\r\n_Care of Eggs for Hatching._ Since egg production usually begins early\r\nin the spring while the weather is still cold, it is necessary to gather\r\nthe eggs at frequent intervals to prevent their freezing or becoming\r\nchilled. Later in the season daily collection will be satisfactory. The\r\neggs as collected should be kept in a cool place and where the\r\nevaporation of the egg contents will not be too great. If set at fairly\r\nfrequent intervals, there will be no difficulty on this score. If they\r\nare to be kept for some time, they may be stored in bran to prevent\r\nevaporation. It is well to mark the eggs as gathered with the date they\r\nare laid so as to overcome the possibility of saving too long any eggs\r\nfor hatching.\r\n\r\nSome goose raisers think that it is best to wash goose eggs before\r\nsetting them. This belief is based on the fact that when a goose makes\r\nher own nest and has access to water in which to swim she comes on the\r\nnest with her feathers wet. It is to simulate this condition that the\r\neggs are washed. Certainly any dirty eggs should be washed.\r\n\r\n_Methods of Incubation._ The most usual methods of hatching goose eggs\r\nare by means of the chicken hen and the goose. Incubators may also be\r\nused but do not as a rule seem to give as good results as they do with\r\nhen or duck eggs. Turkey hens may also be utilized for this purpose but\r\nare not commonly available although they make good mothers. Probably the\r\nmost common method of hatching is the use of chicken hens. Next common\r\nis to allow the goose to hatch her own eggs. Goose eggs hatch well under\r\nhens or geese. During the height of the season nearly every fertile egg\r\nshould hatch if the breeding geese are managed and fed so that they are\r\nin good condition. Early in the season the eggs may not run as fertile\r\nor hatch as well as later.\r\n\r\n_Period of Incubation._ The period of incubation of goose eggs is\r\napproximately 30 days, but may vary from 28 to 33 or occasionally even\r\n35 days.\r\n\r\n_Hatching with Chicken Hens._ Chicken hens are used very commonly to\r\nhatch goose eggs both because they give good results and are readily\r\navailable and also because it is desirable to take the first eggs laid\r\nby the geese away and not to let them get broody and sit so that they\r\nwill lay more eggs. For the latter reason practically all the eggs laid\r\nearly in the season are hatched by chicken hens.\r\n\r\nThe nest can be prepared for the hen either in a suitable place in a\r\npoultry house or in a shed or other building or in a box or barrel on\r\nthe ground. As soon as the hen shows that she is ready to sit by staying\r\non the nest, in which has been placed a nest egg or two, for a couple of\r\nnights in succession, she may be given a sitting of eggs. Four to 6\r\ngoose eggs will constitute a sitting for a common hen. The hen should be\r\nconfined to the nest being let off only once a day for exercise, feed\r\nand water.\r\n\r\nThe sitting hen must be given good care, being even more particular in\r\nthis respect than when she is sitting on hens' eggs as the period of\r\nincubation is longer. In addition to being careful to see that the hen\r\ncomes off her nest for food and water she should be dusted 2 or 3 times\r\nduring the hatch with some good insect powder to keep her free from lice\r\nand therefore contented to stay on the nest. Two or 3 days before the\r\ngoslings hatch she should be dusted with especial care so that the\r\ngoslings will be free from vermin.\r\n\r\nOn account of the large size of the eggs the hen should not be depended\r\nupon to turn them and this should be done by hand once or twice daily.\r\n\r\n_Hatching with Geese._ All breeds of geese will hatch their eggs\r\nalthough some are more persistently broody than others while there is a\r\nconsiderable difference in individuals in this respect. Toulouse and\r\nChinese are perhaps the least broody of the breeds and are sometimes\r\ntermed non-broody. The eggs laid by geese are generally gathered as\r\nlaid. If this were not done they will become broody and stop laying\r\nquicker than they do under this treatment.\r\n\r\nThe goose should be allowed to make her own nest. Often she will do this\r\nin a barrel, box or other shelter if these are conveniently available.\r\nWhen she shows that she is broody and has stopped laying she should be\r\ngiven a sitting of eggs which will consist of 10 or 11. Geese are often\r\ndifficult to manage when they have young.\r\n\r\nWild and Egyptian geese should always be allowed to make their own nests\r\nwhich they like to do on dry ground near the water, using straw leaves\r\nor similar material to make the nest. They should not be disturbed as\r\nthey are ugly during this time. They will hatch practically every egg.\r\n\r\n_Breaking Up Broody Geese._ A goose which shows a desire to sit, can be\r\nbroken up quite easily by confining her to a slat-bottomed coop without\r\nany feed, but with plenty of water to drink, for from 2 to 4 days. After\r\nbeing broken up she will generally commence laying again after an\r\ninterval of a few days.\r\n\r\n_Hatching with an Incubator._ While it is more difficult to hatch goose\r\neggs in incubators than it is hen or duck eggs, this can be done by an\r\nexperienced operator with a fair degree of success. The incubator should\r\nbe operated at a temperature of 101.5 to 102.5 degrees F., with the\r\nthermometer so placed that the bulb is on a level with the top of the\r\neggs. Beginning with the third day, the eggs should be turned twice a\r\nday as with hens' eggs. Beginning about the tenth day, the eggs should\r\nbe cooled once a day, and they need more cooling than hens' eggs\r\nrequire. They should be cooled down to a temperature of about 80 to 85\r\ndegrees. All goose eggs whether in incubators or under hens or geese\r\nshould be tested once during the hatch. The best time to do this is\r\nsometime between the tenth and fourteenth days, when any infertile eggs\r\nor dead germs should be thrown out.\r\n\r\n_Moisture for Hatching Eggs._ Where eggs are being hatched in an\r\nincubator, there is need for the use of considerable moisture. It should\r\nbe added first at about the end of the first week of incubation and\r\nshould be repeated a couple of times during the second week. This can\r\nbest be done by sprinkling the eggs liberally with water heated to about\r\n100 degrees. Beginning with the 15th day and until 2 or 3 days before\r\nthe eggs are ready to hatch soak them in warm water for from one-half a\r\nminute to a minute once every 2 or 3 days. For the last 2 or 3 days do\r\nthis daily.\r\n\r\nWhen the eggs are being hatched by chicken hens or geese in nests\r\nindoors or in boxes or barrels and in dry weather, moisture should be\r\nadded in the same manner and with the same frequency and amount as in\r\nthe incubator. When the nest is on damp ground, it is not necessary to\r\nuse any moisture on the eggs.\r\n\r\n_Hatching._ Goslings as a rule hatch rather slowly and somewhat\r\nunevenly, especially when under hens. For this reason it is well to\r\nremove each gosling as it hatches from under the hen or goose and place\r\nit in a covered, cloth-lined box or basket and keep near the stove\r\nuntil the hatch is completed. As soon as the hatch is over, the goslings\r\nthat have been removed from the nest can be put back under the hen or\r\ngoose which is to be allowed to assume the duties of motherhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nBrooding and Rearing Goslings\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the hatch is completed all the goslings which have been removed\r\nfrom the nest should be returned; and the hen or goose removed to the\r\ncoop which she is to occupy while brooding them. At this time, if\r\nhatched with a hen the goslings should be examined carefully on the head\r\nand neck to see whether there are any head lice present. If any are\r\nfound the heads and necks of the goslings must be greased with a little\r\nlard or vaseline. Not too much grease should be used as it may prove\r\nharmful to the goslings.\r\n\r\n_Methods of Brooding._ The most common methods of brooding goslings are\r\nthe use of geese, of chicken hens or of artificial means. Geese make the\r\nbest mothers but are not always available especially during the early\r\nhatches. Geese may also prove rather unruly when they have young and for\r\nthis reason are not in favor with some goose raisers. When hatching is\r\ndone simultaneously with geese and hens it is the practice of some\r\nraisers to give all the goslings hatched to the geese to rear.\r\n\r\nHens can be used very successfully for rearing goslings especially if\r\nthey are confined to a coop for the first week or two so that they\r\ncannot range too far and too fast and tire the goslings out. Not over 6\r\nor 8 goslings should be given to a hen to brood.\r\n\r\nArtificial methods are very successful with goslings much more so in\r\nfact than are artificial methods of hatching the eggs. Some goose\r\nraisers prefer to use artificial means of brooding, especially if they\r\nhave only a few goslings and are brooding at the same time some chicks\r\nor ducklings.\r\n\r\n_Brooding with Hens or Geese._ A suitable roomy coop should be provided\r\nto which the goslings with their mother, either hen or goose, can be\r\nmoved when the hatch is completed. The coop should be so constructed by\r\nmeans of a slatted front or otherwise, that the hen can be confined and\r\nthe goslings allowed to range. It is very desirable to get the goslings\r\nout on grass as soon as possible. A goose with goslings is often allowed\r\nto have her liberty but many raisers prefer to confine her to a coop the\r\nsame as when a hen is used. The coop should have a board floor well\r\nbedded with straw, shavings or similar material. This will not only help\r\nto keep the goslings dry but will also serve to protect them from their\r\nenemies during the night. For this same reason the coop should be so\r\nconstructed that it can be closed at night by means of a wire covered\r\ndoor so as to shut out marauders, and at the same time allow plenty of\r\nventilation. The coop must be cleaned often so as to keep the goslings\r\nclean and dry.\r\n\r\n_Length of Time Brooding Is Necessary._ The time that goslings need\r\nbrooding will, of course, depend upon the weather. During mild weather\r\n10 days is usually sufficient, after which they can do without any\r\nbrooding. Early in the season, brooding must be extended over a longer\r\nperiod. This may mean anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks or even longer.\r\n\r\n_Artificial Brooding._ For this purpose any brooder utilized for chicks\r\nor ducks can be used for goslings. To start with they should have a\r\ntemperature of about 100 degrees but this can be reduced in a few days\r\nuntil in a week or ten days it is only 70 to 80 degrees or if the\r\nweather is mild artificial heat may be dispensed with entirely. Where\r\nthere are only a few goslings they may be put with a brood of ducks as\r\nlong as they need heat. It does not work so well to put them with chicks\r\nboth because they do not require a high temperature so long as the\r\nchicks and also because they are so large as to be likely to tread on\r\nand injure some of the chicks. Brooders should be well bedded with\r\nstraw, shavings or some similar material and should be cleaned out every\r\n2 or 3 days so as to be kept clean and dry. Do not crowd the goslings;\r\ngive them plenty of room.\r\n\r\nSome goose raisers do not depend upon heated brooders at all, especially\r\nwhen only a few goslings are to be brooded. For the first day or two the\r\ngoslings are kept in a covered basket or box in the house near a fire\r\nand after this are put out during the warmth of the day but brought into\r\nthe house and put in the basket or box at night until they are two or\r\nthree weeks old. The same practice should be followed with goslings\r\nreared in brooders, these being used only during the night after the\r\nfirst 2 or 3 days, the goslings being put out-doors during the day in\r\ngood weather.\r\n\r\nWhen goslings which are being artificially brooded are put out during\r\nthe day on the grass, they should be confined at first. This can be\r\neasily accomplished by building a triangular enclosure, formed of 3\r\nboards, 1 foot wide or wider, placed up on edge. This enclosure can be\r\neasily shifted to a new position each day thus giving the goslings fresh\r\nground and fresh grass.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Care of Growing Goslings\r\n\r\nGoslings should be kept dry and for this reason should be kept shut up\r\nuntil the dew is off the grass in the morning. For the same reason they\r\nshould not be allowed access to water in which to swim until they are at\r\nleast 3 or 4 weeks old. When allowed to swim, care should be taken to\r\nsee that they can get out of the water easily.\r\n\r\nGoslings caught in a cold rain will often be overcome and apparently\r\ndead. Frequently they can be revived and saved by wrapping them in a\r\nheated cloth and placing them near a warm fire. While they are still\r\nyoung, goslings should be driven under shelter whenever a rain storm\r\ncomes up.\r\n\r\nWhen allowed to run at liberty, goslings must be kept track of to some\r\nextent. They may become lost and have to be driven back to their shelter\r\nat night. Or they may fall into holes or get caught in fences and\r\ncorners and must be released. When allowed to run with larger stock they\r\nare more or less liable to injury from being stepped upon or kicked.\r\n\r\nA growing coop or shelter of some sort should be provided for the\r\ngrowing goslings although this is not always done after they are pretty\r\nwell feathered out. Such a coop should be large enough so that the\r\ngoslings are not crowded, and should be well ventilated. It should have\r\na board floor and be capable of being closed so as to protect the\r\ngoslings from their enemies, but without cutting off ventilation.\r\n\r\nIf natural shade is not available where the goslings range, artificial\r\nshade of some sort must be provided during the hot weather. Growing\r\ngoslings are quite susceptible to extreme heat and will not make as good\r\ngrowth if not provided with shade. Artificial shade of boards or brush\r\ncan be easily provided.\r\n\r\nIf for any reason it is necessary to confine growing goslings, they\r\nshould be provided with good grass yards or runs and their coops or\r\nshelters should be moved to a fresh location frequently.\r\n\r\nIt is better, if possible, to keep the growing stock separate from the\r\nold breeding stock as they will do better and make more rapid growth\r\nunder these conditions. Usually, however, where only a few geese are\r\nreared each year, old and young stock are allowed to range together.\r\n\r\n_Feeding the Goslings._ Like chicks or ducks, goslings do not need to be\r\nfed as soon as hatched, the yolk of the eggs providing all the\r\nnourishment they need for at least 36 hours. They should, however, be\r\nfurnished water to drink as soon as the hatch is completed.\r\n\r\nThe first feed should consist of stale bread, soaked in milk or water.\r\nWith this material should be mixed boiled eggs chopped up fine. The\r\ngoslings should be fed 3 or preferably 4 times daily until they are 2 or\r\n3 weeks old. Chopped grass or some other green feed should be added to\r\nthe feed, the quantity fed being increased steadily. It is important to\r\nget the goslings out on grass as soon as possible, which should be after\r\nthe first 2 or 3 days if the weather is good, so that they will be able\r\nto graze for themselves. Five per cent of fine grit or sharp sand should\r\nlikewise be added to the feed. Some growers prefer to feed the grit or\r\nsand in a hopper to which the goslings have constant access and from\r\nwhich they can help themselves. A constant supply of fresh drinking\r\nwater is essential and this should be provided in drinking fountains or\r\ndishes such that the goslings cannot get their feet or bodies in them.\r\n\r\nWhen a good grass range is available, the goslings, after they are 2 or\r\n3 weeks old, will need only one light feed of mash daily in addition to\r\nthe grass they eat. Such a mash will consist of 2 parts shorts and 1\r\npart corn meal, ground oats or ground barley. Where the pasture is good\r\nmany goslings are raised from the age of 2 or 3 weeks until they are\r\nready to be fattened without any other feed than the grass and other\r\nmaterial which they get for themselves. However, the feeding of one\r\nlight feed of mash a day is advantageous as it insures adequate feed for\r\ntheir need and promotes quicker growth. After the goslings are 6 weeks\r\nold, if they are still fed, the mash should be changed to equal parts\r\nshorts, corn meal and ground oats with 5% meat scrap. This same mash can\r\nbe continued until fattening time. Whole grains are not generally fed to\r\ngoslings until they are well feathered and often not until it is desired\r\nto fatten them.\r\n\r\n_Percentage of Goslings Raised._ Goslings are for the most part quite\r\nhardy and are comparatively easy to brood. This coupled with the fact\r\nthat they are relatively free from disease and are not much troubled\r\nwith insect pests makes it possible to raise a large per cent of the\r\nthrifty goslings hatched. With good care and with good strong healthy\r\nstock, it should be possible to raise in the neighborhood of 90% of the\r\ngoslings hatched.\r\n\r\n_Rapidity of Growth._ Goslings make a very rapid growth. When marketed\r\nas green geese they are usually turned off at from 12 to 16 weeks of\r\nage. At this age they should weigh from 9 to 12 pounds, depending upon\r\nthe breed and upon the rapidity of growth. Many, probably most, young\r\ngeese are not marketed at as early an age as this but are held until the\r\nChristmas season or later and marketed at heavier weight. The best grown\r\nToulouse goslings should attain a weight of 16 to 18 pounds by Christmas\r\nor when 6 to 8 months old. Other breeds will weigh proportionately less.\r\nSpecial attention or special feeding will, of course, increase the\r\nweight over that attained without such feeding.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the heavier breeds such as the Toulouse do not get their full\r\ngrowth until they are about 18 months old. After this as geese of both\r\nsexes grow older, they will, of course, fill out more and attain greater\r\nweight.\r\n\r\n_Disease._ Goslings are remarkably free from disease and a very large\r\npercentage of all strong goslings hatched should be reared. One of the\r\nprincipal difficulties is diarrhoea. This is usually caused by faulty\r\nfeeding. It may be due to feeding too great a quantity of soft feed or\r\nto giving soft feed in too sloppy a condition. Access to stagnant water,\r\nunclean enclosures or unclean drinking dishes may also cause diarrhoea.\r\nWhen partly grown goslings which are being given soft feed are troubled\r\nwith diarrhoea, this may sometimes be checked by substituting a light\r\nfeed of corn daily for a part of the soft feed.\r\n\r\nGoslings are sometimes troubled with lameness. This is usually caused by\r\nfaulty feeding also, particularly by feeding a ration which is lacking\r\nin something needed, such as some form of animal feed like beef scrap\r\nwhich may cause a lack of mineral matter in the ration. If the goslings\r\ncannot secure it for themselves a supply of grit or gravel should be\r\nplaced at their disposal.\r\n\r\nThere is an infectious disease of geese which sometimes causes trouble\r\nknown as goose septicemia or hemorrhagic septicemia. This is a disease\r\nsimilar to fowl cholera and may attack either young or mature geese. It\r\nis not often found on farms where the geese are raised in small lots,\r\nbut sometimes proves troublesome on farms where a large number of geese\r\nare gathered together for fattening. The geese are often found dead when\r\none goes to feed them without having shown much preliminary sickness.\r\nThe disease is usually fatal. Shortly before they die the affected geese\r\nmay acquire an uncertain gait and may twist the head about and burrow it\r\nin the dirt. Treatment is of no avail. If the disease occurs in a flock,\r\nthe affected birds should be removed and killed, while the rest of the\r\nflock should be moved to new ground if possible. The ground which they\r\npreviously occupied should be plowed and any houses, shelter, feed\r\ntroughs, and drinking vessels should be thoroughly disinfected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nFattening and Marketing Geese\r\n\r\n\r\n_Classes of Geese Marketed._ The market geese consist principally of the\r\nsurplus young ganders not required for breeding purposes and such of the\r\nold geese of either sex as it may be considered desirable to get rid of.\r\nSome young females, when the number raised is in excess of the number\r\nrequired for breeders also find their way to market. While these geese\r\nare marketed in the largest numbers during the Thanksgiving and\r\nChristmas holiday season, particularly the latter, some geese of course\r\nfind their way to market practically throughout the year. There is also\r\na rather limited trade in \"green geese\" which corresponds to the trade\r\nin spring or \"green\" ducklings. Green geese are goslings about 12 to 16\r\nweeks old, generally of the larger breeds, which are forced for rapid\r\ngrowth and are made to weigh in the neighborhood of 10 pounds at that\r\nage. These bring a good price and yield a good profit where there is\r\ndemand for this class of geese.\r\n\r\n_Markets and Prices._ As with most classes of poultry, the large cities\r\noffer the best market for geese. Especially the cities which have a\r\nlarge foreign population make good markets as many foreigners are more\r\nin the habit of using geese for a holiday dish than are native\r\nAmericans. The most favorable market usually occurs at Christmas when\r\nroast goose and apple sauce is in considerable favor. Considerable\r\nnumbers of geese are also used at Thanksgiving time and in recent years\r\nas the price of turkeys has steadily increased there has been an\r\nincreasing tendency to substitute goose for turkey on that day.\r\nFollowing are prices paid for various classes of geese on the New York\r\nwholesale market from May 1920 to June 1921 as reported by the New York\r\nProduce Review. Quite a wide variation in price will be noted in many\r\ncases which reflects the difference in condition of the geese as\r\nreceived. In the case of express receipts of live geese where a wide\r\nvariation in prices occurs the high quotations represent the receipt of\r\nespecially fattened geese from nearby farms.\r\n\r\nWESTERN GEESE, FROZEN\r\n\r\n1920\r\nMay   5      25 @ 31c per lb.\r\n     12      25 @ 31c  \"  \"\r\n     19      25 @ 31c  \"  \"\r\n     26      25 @ 31c  \"  \"\r\nJune  2      25 @ 31c  \"  \"\r\n      9      25 @ 31c  \"  \"\r\n     16      25 @ 31c  \"  \"\r\n     23      25 @ 31c  \"  \"\r\n     30      23 @ 29c  \"  \"\r\nJuly  7      23 @ 29c  \"  \"\r\n     14      21 @ 27c  \"  \"\r\n     21      21 @ 27c  \"  \"\r\n     28      21 @ 27c  \"  \"\r\nAug.  4      20 @ 25c  \"  \"\r\n\r\n1921\r\nJan. 26      26 @ 34c  \"  \"\r\nFeb.  2      26 @ 34c  \"  \"\r\n      9      26 @ 36c  \"  \"\r\n     16      26 @ 36c  \"  \"\r\n     23      26 @ 36c  \"  \"\r\nMar.  2      26 @ 36c  \"  \"\r\n      9      25 @ 35c  \"  \"\r\n     16      25 @ 35c  \"  \"\r\n     23      25 @ 35c  \"  \"\r\n     30      25 @ 35c  \"  \"\r\nApr.  6      25 @ 35c  \"  \"\r\n     13      25 @ 35c  \"  \"\r\n     20      25 @ 35c  \"  \"\r\n     27      25 @ 35c  \"  \"\r\nMay   4      25 @ 35c  \"  \"\r\n     11      25 @ 35c  \"  \"\r\n\r\nFRESH DRESSED GEESE\r\n\r\n1920\r\nNov. 17      34 @ 43c per lb.\r\n     24      30 @ 38c  \"  \"\r\nDec.  1      25 @ 36c  \"  \"\r\n      8      30 @ 36c  \"  \"\r\n     15      30 @ 39c  \"  \"\r\n     22      30 @ 40c  \"  \"\r\n     29      30 @ 40c  \"  \"\r\n\r\n1921\r\nJan.  5      30 @ 37c  \"  \"\r\n     12      25 @ 35c  \"  \"\r\n     19      25 @ 34c  \"  \"\r\n     26      25 @ 34c  \"  \"\r\n\r\n\r\nFRESH DRESSED GEESE\r\n\r\n1921\r\nFeb.  2      25 @ 34c per    lb.\r\n      9      26 @ 36c  \"  \"\r\n     16      26 @ 36c  \"  \"\r\n     23      26 @ 36c  \"  \"\r\nMar.  2      26 @ 36c  \"  \"\r\n      9      25 @ 35c  \"  \"\r\n     16      25 @ 35c  \"  \"\r\n     23      25 @ 35c  \"  \"\r\n\r\nLIVE GEESE--VIA FREIGHT\r\n\r\n1920\r\nMay   5      18 @ 20c per  lb.\r\n     12      22c       \"  \"\r\n     19      20 @ 22c  \"  \"\r\n     26      20 @ 22c  \"  \"\r\nJune  2      20 @ 22c  \"  \"\r\n      9      20 @ 22c  \"  \"\r\n     16      20 @ 22c  \"  \"\r\n     23      18 @ 20c  \"  \"\r\n     30      18 @ 20c  \"  \"\r\nJuly  7      18 @ 20c  \"  \"\r\n     14      18 @ 20c  \"  \"\r\n     28      25c       \"  \"\r\nAug   4      25c       \"  \"\r\n     18      25c       \"  \"\r\n     25      25c       \"  \"\r\nSept. 1      25c       \"  \"\r\n     22      26c       \"  \"\r\n     29      26c       \"  \"\r\nOct. 20      25 @ 28c  \"  \"\r\n     27      27 @ 30c  \"  \"\r\nNov.  3      32c       \"  \"\r\n     10      32c       \"  \"\r\n     17      32c       \"  \"\r\n     24      28 @ 32c  \"  \"\r\nDec.  1      28 @ 30c  \"  \"\r\n      8      30 @ 34c  \"  \"\r\n     15      28 @ 35c  \"  \"\r\n     22      25 @ 30c  \"  \"\r\n     29      27 @ 32c  \"  \"\r\n\r\n1921\r\nJan.  5      26 @ 32c  \"  \"\r\n     12      26 @ 30c  \"  \"\r\n     19      25 @ 29c  \"  \"\r\n     26      25 @ 29c  \"  \"\r\nFeb.  2      27 @ 33c  \"  \"\r\n      9      28 @ 33c  \"  \"\r\n     16      26 @ 32c  \"  \"\r\n     23      25 @ 26c  \"  \"\r\n\r\nLIVE GEESE--VIA FREIGHT\r\n\r\n1921\r\nMar.  2      25c  per lb.\r\n      9      18 @ 20c  \"  \"\r\n     16      18 @ 20c  \"  \"\r\n     23      20c       \"  \"\r\n     30      20c       \"  \"\r\nApr.  6      15 @ 18c  \"  \"\r\n     13      15 @ 18c  \"  \"\r\n     20      15 @ 18c  \"  \"\r\n     27      15 @ 18c  \"  \"\r\nMay   4      14 @ 16c  \"  \"\r\n     11      14 @ 16c  \"  \"\r\n     18      14 @ 16c  \"  \"\r\n     25      14 @ 16c  \"  \"\r\nJune  1      14 @ 16c  \"  \"\r\n\r\nLIVE GEESE--VIA EXPRESS\r\n\r\n1920\r\nNov. 24      30 @ 33c per lb.\r\nDec.  1      30 @ 32c  \"  \"\r\n      8      32 @ 35c  \"  \"\r\n     15      30c       \"  \"\r\n     22      30c       \"  \"\r\n     29      28 @ 35c  \"  \"\r\n\r\n1921\r\nJan.  5      29 @ 38c  \"  \"\r\n     12      28 @ 38c  \"  \"\r\n     19      28 @ 36c  \"  \"\r\n     26      27 @ 37c  \"  \"\r\nFeb.  9      28 @ 40c  \"  \"\r\n     16      28 @ 42c  \"  \"\r\n     23      26 @ 28c  \"  \"\r\nMar.  2      25 @ 28c  \"  \"\r\n      9      20 @ 23c  \"  \"\r\n     16      18 @ 22c  \"  \"\r\n     23      18 @ 22c  \"  \"\r\n     30      20 @ 23c  \"  \"\r\nApr.  6      17 @ 20c  \"  \"\r\n     13      17 @ 20c  \"  \"\r\n     20      17 @ 21c  \"  \"\r\n     27      16 @ 20c  \"  \"\r\nMay   4      15 @ 18c  \"  \"\r\n     11      15 @ 18c  \"  \"\r\n     18      15 @ 18c  \"  \"\r\n     25      15 @ 18c  \"  \"\r\n\r\n_Prejudice Against Roast Goose._ There exists on the part of some\r\npersons a prejudice against goose on the grounds that it is too greasy a\r\ndish. When improperly cooked, goose will prove to be too greasy to suit\r\nmany fastidious palates but this condition is not so much the fault of\r\nthe fowl as it is of the method of preparation and cooking. When dressed\r\nif the goose shows a large amount of abdominal fat, as it usually does\r\nand should, a large part of this should be removed. This fat when tried\r\nout is highly esteemed by many cooks and by other persons is treasured\r\nas an efficacious treatment for croup in children. Also while the goose\r\nis roasting, a part of the fat as it cooks out of the carcass should be\r\nremoved. Treated in this way one need have no fear that the roast goose\r\nwill prove too greasy but instead one will be pleasantly surprised at\r\nthe rich taste which the roast goose possesses.\r\n\r\n_Methods of Fattening Geese for Market._ Many geese are sent to market\r\nwithout any special treatment or effort to fatten them, being taken\r\nright off pasture in such condition as they happen to be or at best with\r\nonly a half-hearted attempt to fatten them by feeding a little corn or\r\nsome other grain for a short period. When a real effort is made to\r\nfatten geese for the market it is generally done in one of three ways.\r\nFirst is pen fattening which is the method best adapted to small lots of\r\ngeese on the average farm. Second is by noodling which is only attempted\r\nin sections where the goose raisers are somewhat of specialists and\r\nwhere the effort is made to turn out geese of superior quality. Third is\r\nfattening in large flocks which is practiced only by a very limited\r\nnumber of farmers in scattered sections who take the unfattened geese\r\nraised on the general farms and finish them for market.\r\n\r\n_Pen Fattening._ For this purpose the geese are put in pens large enough\r\nto hold them comfortably but without any yards. Not over 20 to 25 geese\r\nshould be penned together for this purpose. To get the best results the\r\ngeese should be kept as quiet as possible and to accomplish this the\r\npens are partly darkened and the geese disturbed only at feeding time.\r\nThe geese are fed three times daily; in the morning, at noon and at\r\nnight, being given all they will clean up. One feed should consist of a\r\nmoist mash composed of one part shorts and two parts corn meal. This\r\nmash should not be sloppy. The other two feeds consist mainly of corn\r\nwith some oats or barley. Some roughage such as vegetables or hay should\r\nalso be supplied. The pens should be deeply bedded with good oat straw.\r\nThe geese will eat a considerable amount of this which thus helps to\r\nsupply the roughage which they need. The straw also, of course, serves\r\nto keep the pen and the birds clean. A plentiful supply of good drinking\r\nwater is also necessary. The usual period of fattening is three to five\r\nweeks and a gain of from 4 to 6 pounds per bird can be secured. This\r\nmethod of fattening is commonly used by goose raisers in Wisconsin and\r\nthe geese from this state are noted for their fine quality.\r\n\r\nA less intensive form of pen fattening is often used by farmers where a\r\nsmall yard is provided in addition to the pen itself and where no effort\r\nis made to darken the pen. If no other means for fattening are\r\navailable, a small yard can be built, a few boards arranged for a\r\nshelter at one end and the birds fed in this enclosure as described\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n_Noodling Geese._ Noodling geese is a method of hand feeding which has\r\nfor its purpose the production of the best fattened geese. It is not\r\nemployed to any extent except in the section about Watertown, Wisconsin,\r\nwhere the farmers specialize to some extent on goose fattening. It is a\r\nmethod requiring long hours and tedious labor and cannot be profitably\r\ncarried on unless a special price can be obtained for the product.\r\n\r\nIn noodling geese, 8 or 10 geese are placed in a pen about 8 by 12 feet\r\nwhich is heavily bedded with straw. A partition extends halfway across\r\nthe pen and is utilized to keep the geese separate as they are fed.\r\nYoung ganders and any old ganders or geese which are to be marketed are\r\nused for noodling.\r\n\r\nThe pen is kept dark and the geese should be disturbed only at feeding\r\ntime. The first feed is given at 5 o'clock in the morning and five feeds\r\nare given daily at about 4 hour intervals, the last feed coming at 11 p.\r\nm. However, when the geese are first put on feed they are noodled only\r\n3 times a day this being gradually increased to 5 times. The feeder sits\r\non a box or stool in a corner of the pen, grasps each goose in turn\r\nholding it between his legs to keep it from struggling as he stuffs it\r\nwith noodles. The goose is handled by its neck, never by its legs which\r\nare easily injured, and is held with its back toward the feeder. The\r\nfeeder usually wears gloves to protect his hands from the severe bites\r\nwhich the birds will inflict. The feeder must also handle the birds as\r\ncarefully as possible, especially as killing time approaches for the\r\nflesh bruises easily and the discolored patches spoil the appearance of\r\nthe dressed goose.\r\n\r\nThe feeder at the start usually gives each goose from 3 to 5 noodles,\r\ngradually increasing this to 6 or 7 noodles if the birds will stand it,\r\nthe number of noodles fed depending upon the size and condition of each\r\nbird, the feeder being obliged to use his judgment in this matter. In\r\ngeneral if any feed can be felt in the craw, no noodles are given until\r\nthe next feeding time. Failure to observe this is likely to cause the\r\nbird to go off feed. If any geese are noticed which are off feed they\r\nshould be taken out and marketed.\r\n\r\nThe noodles are made of scalded corn meal, ground oats, ground barley\r\nand ground wheat or wheat flour, using equal parts of each. This\r\nmaterial is thoroughly mixed and salted as one would bread and is then\r\nput through a sausage stuffer. The product as it comes from the stuffer\r\nis cut into noodles about 2-1/2 or 3 inches long and these are boiled for\r\n10 or 15 minutes or until they float. A wash boiler with a wire rack\r\nforming a false bottom about 1-1/2 inches above the boiler bottom is used\r\nfor this purpose. When cooked the noodles are dipped in cold water and\r\nthen rolled in flour to keep them from sticking together. A supply of\r\nnoodles is made which will last for 2 or 3 days' feeding.\r\n\r\nJust before feeding, hot water is poured over the noodles to make them\r\nwarm and slippery. The mouth of the goose is forced open and the noodles\r\nare put in, one at a time, and worked down by using the fingers on the\r\noutside of the neck. As each goose is fed it is placed on the other side\r\nof the partition until all in the pen have been fed. It is important\r\nthat plenty of drinking water be kept before the geese.\r\n\r\nThe feeding period where geese are noodled usually extends from 3 to 4\r\nweeks. Gains of 6 to 10 pounds per bird can be secured and often an\r\nincreased price of 10 to 15 cents a pound can be secured for such\r\nspecially fattened geese. Noodled geese will average about 25 pounds and\r\nsome individuals have been made to weigh nearly 40 pounds. One man can\r\nnoodle from 50 to 100 geese but has to put in long hours. Noodled geese\r\nshould be dressed where fattened as they are soft fleshed and would\r\nshrink badly if shipped alive.\r\n\r\nFattening methods similar to the noodling described are used in parts\r\nof Europe for the production of the enlarged goose livers which are\r\nemployed in making \"patte de fois gras\".\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods Used on Fattening Farms\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, a few farmers make a specialty of buying the\r\ngeese in their section of the country in the fall when it is too late\r\nfor serious trouble to develop from hemorrhagic septicemia, a disease\r\nsimilar to fowl cholera, and to fatten or finish them in large flocks\r\nfor the Thanksgiving and Christmas markets. Methods are employed in\r\ndifferent sections which differ quite widely.\r\n\r\nOn a farm in the Middle West the geese are collected from the general\r\nfarms where they are produced in small flocks and brought to the farm\r\nwhere they are kept in flocks as large as 1,000 or even more, and are\r\nallowed to run in a cornfield or orchard. They are fattened for about a\r\nmonth. Corn on the cob and plenty of water is kept before the geese all\r\nthe time and if they are running in a cornfield they eat the leaves off\r\nthe corn stalks for roughage. Roughage is supplied if not available\r\notherwise and straw, hay or vegetables are utilized for this purpose.\r\n\r\nNo shelter is provided during mild weather, the geese getting such\r\nprotection as they can from the trees or corn stalks. If the weather\r\nturns unusually severe, the geese are generally driven into sheds or\r\nbarns. When fattened the geese are usually shipped to some large market\r\nalive. Several farms in the neighborhood of Boston make a specialty of\r\nfinishing geese each fall, and the methods used are quite different from\r\nthose described above. No geese are raised on these farms, the operation\r\nbeing confined to the fattening or finishing of the geese and to killing\r\nand dressing them for the market. Some of these goose fatteners also\r\nhave stalls or stands in the Boston markets where they are enabled to\r\ndispose of their fattened geese to the best advantage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55. Large flock of geese fattening in an orchard.\r\n(_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture._)]\r\n\r\n_Fatteners._ In previous years these fatteners depended largely upon the\r\ngeese produced on the Rhode Island farms for their supply. In the past\r\nfew years, however, the supply from this source has dwindled greatly and\r\nthe bulk of the geese for fattening are now shipped from Prince Edward\r\nIsland, Canada, in carload lots. Such summer geese as are now fattened\r\nstill come from Rhode Island and are brought in by truck. The fattening\r\nseason begins in September and lasts until Christmas. Some early\r\ngoslings are bought in June but there is not as good a profit from the\r\nsummer geese, the demand and prices being adversely affected by the\r\nsupply of spring ducklings available at that time.\r\n\r\nExperience and good judgment will benefit the goose fattener greatly\r\nwhen purchasing his supply of geese for fattening. What he wants are\r\ngoslings, not older geese, which have made a good growth and which have\r\na large frame but which are in poor flesh rather than fat. Such geese\r\nwill make more rapid and more profitable gains. When geese are bought\r\nfor shipment by the carload from Prince Edward Island, they should be\r\npenned and fed at the point of shipment for 3 or 4 days before they are\r\nloaded in the cars, so as to put them in shape to stand the journey\r\nwell. On the farms from which they come, the goslings are not fed much\r\nand in consequence are not in shape to stand shipment.\r\n\r\n_The Goslings_ which are secured from the farms for fattening are mainly\r\ncommon geese of no particular breed. Some pure bred geese are also\r\nobtained as are some first crosses between the pure breeds. A class of\r\ngeese which is obtained in some numbers from Prince Edward Island and\r\nwhich is much desired is the so-called \"Mongrel\" goose. These are\r\nobtained by breeding a Wild or Canadian gander to geese of dark plumage\r\nsimilar to the Toulouse or African. The mongrel geese much resemble the\r\nwild gander in type and color and are in demand on the market because of\r\ntheir wild or gamy flavor. They bring about 10 cents per pound more than\r\ncommon geese. The market, however, is somewhat limited. These geese will\r\nnot breed although the females will lay eggs. Where the wild gander is\r\nmated with light colored or white geese the offspring will have more or\r\nless light colored feathers and will not as closely resemble the wild\r\nparent and for this reason are not as desirable.\r\n\r\n_Shipping._ The geese are loaded into stock cars into which three\r\nseparate decks are built to accommodate them. From 1200 to 1400 geese\r\ncan be loaded into a car thus arranged. The journey usually takes about\r\n5 or 6 days and some fatteners send a man along with the car to feed and\r\nwater the geese 2 or 3 times during the trip. If a man does not\r\naccompany the car, buckets of corn should be placed in the car for feed\r\nand some potatoes should also be supplied as these will serve in place\r\nof drinking water. If the car is not subjected to unusual delay, the\r\ngeese should come through in good shape, but if much delayed there may\r\nbe 25 to 100 geese dead when the car arrives at its destination.\r\n\r\nWhen the car arrives at the end of its journey, the geese are unloaded\r\nand driven to the farm where they are turned into the fields together in\r\na large flock. The fields in which they are thus kept should have a\r\nsupply of growing green feed or grass and a good supply of fresh\r\ndrinking water. They are kept here until they are wanted for the\r\nfattening pens which may be from a week to 20 days after their arrival\r\nat the farm. While in this large supply flock they are fed on corn and\r\ngrass which they can get for themselves.\r\n\r\n_Summer Geese_ to be fattened are placed only about 50 in a pen or\r\nenclosure; and are provided with a few boards set on posts to protect\r\nthem from the hot sun. The later geese are fattened in lots of 3 or 4\r\nhundred or even more, depending upon how many pickers are available to\r\nbe kept busy. It is for this reason also that the geese are not all put\r\non the fattening ration at the same time, but are started at intervals\r\nso as to have a continuous supply coming along to keep the pickers busy.\r\nThe geese not put in the fattening lots at the start are left in the\r\nfields to grow and develop until they are needed.\r\n\r\nThe enclosures in which the geese are penned for fattening are small\r\nlots or fields enclosed by stone walls or board fences 2-1/2 to 3 feet\r\nhigh. These lots should be dry and well-drained, a location on a side\r\nhill being good for this purpose. The fattening lots must be kept clean\r\nand stagnant water must not be allowed to stand in the lots as this is\r\nlikely to cause sickness, especially diarrhoea. These yards should be\r\nplowed up each spring and planted to oats, corn or some other growing\r\ncrop to sweeten them. No houses or shelters are provided for these geese\r\nbut some yards are somewhat wooded which affords a measure of protection\r\nfrom the wind.\r\n\r\n_Feeding._ When the geese are placed in the fattening lots, some\r\nfatteners prefer to fast the geese for from 3 to 5 days, giving them no\r\nfeed but plenty of water to drink. This gives them a good appetite and\r\nputs them in good shape for fattening.\r\n\r\nThe geese are fed three times a day, in the morning, at noon and at\r\nnight. The morning and night feed usually consists of a moist mixed feed\r\nfed in troughs; while the noon feed is whole corn thrown on the ground.\r\nThe use of one feed of corn a day is supposed to check any tendency\r\ntoward diarrhoea. In very cold weather some fatteners feed the mixed\r\nfeed at noon and the corn at night. At first the geese are not given all\r\nthey will eat but are worked up gradually, increasing the amount each\r\nday until they are getting all they want. As a rule the geese will drop\r\nback a little in feed consumption after they reach the point where they\r\nget all they want and from this time on, the feeding must be very\r\ncarefully watched to see that they are not given so much that they will\r\nleave some to sour which would cause diarrhoea. The morning and noon\r\nfeeds are lighter, the heaviest feed being given at night. The bird's\r\nappetites will vary from day to day so that it is best to make the\r\nrounds twice in feeding to make sure that they have enough and that none\r\nis left. If any is left it must be gathered up and carried away.\r\n\r\nNo provision is made for furnishing the fattening geese with green feed\r\nor roughage. The practice with respect to drinking water varies. Some\r\nfatteners keep a supply before the birds in troughs which must be washed\r\nout each day to keep them clean. Others furnish no water except that\r\nused in mixing up the feed.\r\n\r\n_Corn Meal_ is the principal ingredient of the fattening mixture. To a\r\nsack of corn meal is added 10% beef scrap and five good shovels of grit\r\nor medium sized gravel. In addition some fatteners add 10% of flour to\r\nbind the mixture together. This material should be thoroughly mixed up\r\nin a dry state as a better mix can be obtained in this way. It is then\r\nmixed up with water, the practice here varying. Some fatteners mix in a\r\ntrough with boiling water a short time before feeding, while others mix\r\nit with cold water letting it soak over night and adding more water in\r\nthe morning if it is too dry at that time. It should be mixed until it\r\ncan be shoveled readily but should be quite solid, never in a sloppy\r\ncondition as this is likely to cause diarrhoea. A little salt may be\r\nadded, if desired, as an appetizer. While corn meal is generally used,\r\nhominy may take its place. After the geese are started on the fattening\r\nration, this must be given throughout the fattening period. Changing to\r\nsome other feed will throw the geese off feed and cause a loss.\r\n\r\n_Feeding._ When the mixed feed is ready it is shoveled into boxes or\r\nbarrels on a low wagon and driven to the fattening lots where it is\r\nshoveled into the troughs for the geese. Ordinary V-shaped troughs are\r\nfavored instead of flat troughs as the latter afford hiding places for\r\nrats which may cause damage in addition to the feed which they eat by\r\nfrightening the geese.\r\n\r\nGeese are easily frightened and must therefore be handled rather\r\ncarefully and gently as a severe fright will interfere with the gains\r\nthey will make. Some fatteners provide electric lights where the geese\r\nrest at night so that they can see and will not be so likely to become\r\nfrightened.\r\n\r\nWhen the geese are ready to be killed they are driven up to the killing\r\nhouse and into a pen where they may be easily caught. Each goose as\r\ncaught is examined to see whether it is in condition for killing. If it\r\nis not it is put back with a later lot for additional fattening. Good\r\ncondition in a goose is judged by its weight when handled and also by\r\nthe condition of its breast and the fat on its back. A good place to\r\ntest geese for fat is on the side of the body just below the point where\r\nthe wing joins the body. If fat can be seized between the thumb and\r\nfinger at that point, the goose is in good condition.\r\n\r\n_Dry Picking._ All fattened geese for the Boston market are dry picked.\r\nThe goose is held between the knees of the picker with the wings held\r\nfast against the sides of the body. The head is grasped by the left\r\nhand, the mouth forced open and the veins in the back of the throat just\r\nbeyond the skull severed with a sharp knife for the purpose of bleeding\r\nthe bird. If the bird is to be stuck, which is not always done, the\r\npoint of the knife is then plunged through the roof of the mouth to the\r\nbrain. The legs are then seized in the left hand, together with the ends\r\nof the wings to prevent the goose from struggling and the goose is\r\nstruck once or twice sharply on the back of the head with a club held in\r\nthe right hand. This is for the purpose of stunning the bird. The geese\r\nmay also be bled by sticking the knife through the neck from the outside\r\njust below the head.\r\n\r\nThe picker then takes his seat beside the feather box, holding the goose\r\non his lap with the head held between his knee and the outside of the\r\nbox. He proceeds to pluck the feathers as rapidly as possible, removing\r\nall the feathers except the main wing feathers or those of the first\r\njoint of the wing and the feathers of the neck half way from the head to\r\nthe body. All the soft body feathers are thrown in the box and saved.\r\nThe coarser feathers are thrown on the floor. The down is removed by\r\nrubbing the moistened hand over the skin. To save the hands, ordinary\r\nrubber heels dipped in water are often used. Sharp knives are also used\r\nto shave off the pin feathers which cannot be plucked and any down not\r\nremoved by rubbing.\r\n\r\nThe dry picked goose presents a much better appearance than a scalded\r\ngoose and the feathers are more valuable. The skin of a dry picked bird\r\nis not so likely to be rubbed off in removing the down.\r\n\r\n_The Value of the Feathers_ is sufficient to pay for the cost of the\r\npicking or perhaps a little more. The cost of picking in the fall of\r\n1920 ranged from 15 to 20 cents per goose where the picker was boarded\r\nand 24 cents without board. A good man can pick about 40 geese in a day.\r\nWomen are not employed for this work as the geese are too big and too\r\nstrong for them to handle.\r\n\r\nAfter the geese are picked, the blood is washed from the head and the\r\nfeet washed if that is necessary. They are then thrown into barrels of\r\ncold water to cool and must be left there until the body heat is\r\nentirely removed. The wings are tied in place by means of a string or\r\ntape tied around the body and wings and the legs may also be crossed\r\nover the back and tied. The geese when ready for market are either\r\nshipped in by express or are taken in by automobile truck.\r\n\r\n_Gain in Weight._ In fattening according to the methods described above\r\na gain in weight is secured of from 6 to 8 pounds per goose. This does\r\nnot represent the total gain in value, however, for the fattened geese\r\nwill bring more per pound as a result of their finished condition. The\r\nfattened geese when ready for market will weigh from 12 to 20 pounds.\r\nWeights taken on two carloads of fattened geese showed an average weight\r\nof 14 pounds. On December 2, 1920, fattened geese from these farms were\r\nbringing 42 cents per pound on the Boston market while the mongrel geese\r\nwere worth 50 cents or a little better.\r\n\r\nThe question may arise as to the size of farm necessary to carry on a\r\nbusiness of this sort. Using the methods employed about Boston a farm of\r\n30 acres would be sufficient to handle 20,000 geese in a season. In\r\nselecting a farm for such a purpose, a location should be chosen where\r\nthere are no close neighbors as the odor from the geese and yards is\r\noffensive to most persons.\r\n\r\n_Selling Geese Alive._ Most farmers who raise only a few geese ship them\r\nalive, either sending them to some commission house or selling them to\r\nsomeone who makes a specialty of fattening. Such geese are often in\r\npoor condition and bring the lowest quotation. Large coops similar to\r\nthose used for turkeys should be used in shipping geese.\r\n\r\n_Killing._ Where geese are killed on the farm for shipment to market\r\nthey are usually hung up by means of a cord about the legs. When geese\r\nare to be dry picked the veins in the throat just beyond the skull are\r\nfirst severed with a long bladed knife such as used for killing turkeys\r\nto cause good bleeding and the point of the knife is then plunged\r\nthrough the roof of the mouth to the brain performing the stick which\r\nserves to make the feathers come out more easily as with other classes\r\nof poultry. Since it is rather difficult to dry pick geese, they are\r\nusually scalded or steamed and where this is done, the stick is not made\r\nbut after the veins in the throat are cut, the goose is stunned by a\r\nblow on the back of the head with a short club. A blood can or weight is\r\nthen hooked through the lower bill which keeps the neck straightened out\r\nand prevents the blood from being thrown about the room or on the birds.\r\nThe birds are allowed to hang until they are dead and thoroughly bled\r\nout.\r\n\r\n_Picking._ When geese are dry picked, the feathers are removed just as\r\nsoon as the birds are stuck for the longer the delay the harder the\r\nfeathers pull. The wings are picked to the first joint and the feathers\r\nof the neck half-way to the head. The soft pin feathers and fine down\r\nmay be removed by shaving the skin or rubbing the body with moistened\r\nhands will partially remove them.\r\n\r\nUsually geese are scalded or steamed for picking. For steaming a wash\r\nboiler three-quarters full of boiling water and with a burlap sack\r\ntightly stretched over its top can be used. The goose is simply laid on\r\nthe sack and the steam coming through the burlap steams the feathers and\r\nmakes them easy to remove. The breast should be steamed first, then the\r\nback and then each side. Two or three minutes will be time enough to\r\ncomplete the steaming. The feathers are steamed until they pull out\r\neasily. The goose must be kept moving to prevent the flesh from becoming\r\nscalded and since the breast is especially tender it is usual to lay the\r\nhead under the breast to prevent the latter from scalding. After\r\nsteaming the body feathers are removed and the bird is then singed over\r\na flame furnished by alcohol burned in shallow tin plates, in order to\r\nremove the down. The down may also be removed by sprinkling powdered\r\nrosin over the goose's body which is then dipped into hot water. The hot\r\nwater melts the rosin which sticks to the down and the down and rosin\r\ncan then be rubbed off together.\r\n\r\nGeese may also be steamed by scalding slightly in hot water and then\r\nwrapping tightly in burlap or some other cloth. They are kept wrapped\r\nfor about five minutes which allows the steam to work thoroughly through\r\nthe feathers which can then be plucked easily.\r\n\r\nExactly the same methods can and often are employed in dressing geese as\r\nare used with ducks. The reader is therefore also referred to the\r\nmaterial in Chapter VII.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no great insistence on the part of most markets for\r\ndry picked geese. Some will pay slightly more for the dry picked birds\r\nbut others make no difference.\r\n\r\n_Packing for Shipment._ After picking, the geese are washed and then\r\nplaced in cold water to cool. Ice water is best for this purpose and is\r\nessential in warm weather. The carcasses must be allowed to remain in\r\nthe water until they are thoroughly cooled, which will take at least one\r\nto two hours. If any animal heat is left in the bodies, they will spoil\r\nvery quickly. Often the carcasses are dipped in hot water, before being\r\nthrown in the cold water, to plump them. After they are thoroughly\r\ncooled, the geese are packed in barrels for shipping. If the weather is\r\ncool they may be packed in well ventilated barrels without ice, but if\r\nthe weather is warm, cracked ice must be used in packing, proceeding in\r\nthe same way as when packing ducks as described on page 109. It is\r\nalways risky to pack without ice.\r\n\r\n_Saving the Feathers._ Goose feathers are valuable and should therefore\r\nbe saved when the geese are plucked. The soft body feathers and the\r\ncoarser feathers should be kept separate. The feathers should be cured\r\nby spreading them out in a thin layer on the floor of a loft or room,\r\nstirring them up occasionally until they are thoroughly dried out, when\r\nthey can be sacked and sold. Failure to dry the feathers thoroughly will\r\nresult in their heating and molding with the result that they will\r\narrive at their destination in bad shape and will be worth less money.\r\nThe soft body feathers of geese are practically all used in making beds\r\nand pillows while the quills are sometimes utilized in making toothpicks\r\nand cigarette holders. Prices for goose feathers in June 1921 were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nPure White          dry picked  75c per lb.\r\nGood average white   \"    \"     65c  \"   \"\r\nLargely gray         \"    \"     55c  \"   \"\r\nLargely gray         scalded    40c  \"   \"\r\nLong goose quills                5c  \"   \"\r\n\r\nThese prices were for good dry feathers.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlucking Live Geese for their Feathers\r\n\r\nIn the days of feather beds and home-made pillows the practice of\r\nplucking live geese for their feathers was very common. Now, however,\r\nwith the demand for goose feathers less and with the opinion of some\r\nbreeders that plucking geese is both cruel and injurious, the practice\r\nseems to be decreasing. Many goose raisers in the South and a less\r\nnumber in the Middle West and North however still pluck the feathers\r\nfrom the live geese prior to the time of moulting. The frequency with\r\nwhich the picking is done varies greatly, some picking as often as every\r\nsix weeks during the spring, summer and early fall while others pick\r\ntwice, once in the spring and once in the fall, or once in the spring\r\nonly. Geese should never be picked during the late fall or winter when\r\nthe weather is cold or during the breeding season. Both young and old\r\ngeese are plucked and the average yearly production of feathers per\r\ngoose is about one pound. When the quills of the feathers are dry and do\r\nnot contain any blood, the feathers are ripe for picking. In plucking, a\r\nstocking is placed over the head of the goose and the goose held on the\r\nlap and between the legs during the process.\r\n\r\nAn assistant to hold the goose during the plucking simplifies the work\r\ngreatly. In plucking, part of the soft feathers of the breast, sides,\r\nabdomen and back are taken but these sections should not be plucked\r\nclean. It is especially important that enough short feathers be left to\r\nsupport the wings.\r\n\r\nAfter plucking, the feathers must be cured before they are shipped. This\r\nmay be done by spreading them out on a floor as described for the\r\nfeathers taken from slaughtered geese or they may be placed loosely in\r\nburlap sacks and hung up in a garret or loft. Hanging in this way and in\r\nthe loosely woven sacks, they are subjected to a good circulation of air\r\nand will dry out without heating. Sacks of feathers should not be piled\r\nor packed closely together, on top of one another or even be allowed to\r\nlie on the floor until they are thoroughly dry as otherwise they are\r\nalmost sure to heat and mold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nAbsence of crest in Crested White Duck, 34\r\n\r\nAfrican Goose, 156,  157\r\n\r\nAge of\r\n  breeding ducks, 55,  123\r\n  breeding

investment and of labor.)\r\n\r\n\"Sebastapool\" changed to \"Sebastapol\" in List of Illustrations (Egyptian\r\nGander and Sebastapol Goose) Figure 50 caption, and twice in the index.\r\nThis is consistent with the use of \"Sebastapol\" in the text.\r\n\r\nPage 20: \"neccessary\" changed to \"necessary\" (... it becomes neccessary\r\nto mate a smaller number of females ...).\r\n\r\nPage 30: missing page reference added (See Page 14).\r\n\r\nPage 72: comma deleted after \"Of\" (Of course, eggs sufficient to fill\r\nthe entire incubator capacity ...).\r\n\r\nFig 28 caption: \"yords\" changed to \"yards\" (Long brooder house and yards\r\nwith feeding track.)\r\n\r\nPage 107: duplicate word \"the\" deleted (... hung in a steam box with the\r\nheads outside ...)\r\n\r\nPage 131:

\"in\" changed to \"is\" (An objection to geese often expressed\r\nbut without good foundation is that they will spoil the pasture for\r\nother stock.)\r\n\r\nPage 154: \"Ameriacn\" changed to \"American\" (... the American Standard of\r\nPerfection.)\r\n\r\nPage 155 Footnote: \"standard\" changed to initial upper case \"Standard\"\r\n(American Standard of Perfection).\r\n\r\nPage 163: missing page reference added (The same method of packing the\r\neggs should be employed as with duck eggs described on page 137.)\r\n\r\nPage 165: \"thoughout\" changed to \"throughout\" (... green feed available\r\nthroughout the summer and fall ...)\r\n\r\nPage 166: \"penus\" changed to \"penis\" (... the penis will protrude.)\r\n\r\nPage 182: \"close\" changed to \"closed\" (It should have a
