Norris who served as\r\nYellowstone’s second superintendent from 1877 until 1882. Although he\r\ndid not discover it, his explorations and reports were largely\r\nresponsible for calling attention to that area.\r\n\r\nNorris is considered to be the hottest and most active geyser basin in\r\nYellowstone. Here geysers and hot springs exhibit greater change in\r\nactivity over a short span of time than elsewhere in the park. It is not\r\nunusual for a new hot spring to come into existence literally overnight.\r\nThe new feature may last for just a few days or perhaps a month or so;\r\nupon occasion some have endured for many years.\r\n\r\nBecause of constant change in the thermal features, the ground here is\r\nunstable and hazardous in many locations. Therefore, you are required to\r\nstay on designated trails and boardwalks at all times. This not only\r\nprotects you from possible serious burns but also helps preserve the\r\nfeatures as well. Remember also not to throw any objects into thermal\r\nfeatures. Debris of any kind in a hot spring or geyser could clog the\r\nvent and destroy the feature. Because many scalding hot pools and\r\nrun-off channels are near trails and boardwalks, pets are not permitted\r\non the trails.\r\n\r\nThe fact that thermal features change may come as a surprise, but\r\nremember that geysers, hot springs and other thermal phenomena are\r\nsubject to natural stresses just like plant and animal communities. Of\r\ncourse the changes in thermal activity result from a different set of\r\nfactors than those affecting plants and animals. Can you guess what they\r\nmight be?\r\n\r\nShifts in the earth’s crust (earthquakes) result in movements along\r\ncracks and fissures in the ground. These tremors usually cause changes\r\nin the underground “plumbing systems” of thermal features, thus altering\r\nactivity patterns. Look for signs of recent activity variations as you\r\nwalk along the trails, or ask a naturalist if there have been some\r\nrecent changes.\r\n\r\nAs you explore, look closely at the often intricate formations around\r\nthe edges of a few hot pools, geysers and in some thermal runoff\r\nchannels. You will notice a mineral called sinter or geyserite (a form\r\nof silicon dioxide, SiO₂) being deposited like tiny spines. These rather\r\nprickly formations result when geyserite is deposited from slightly acid\r\nwater, a characteristic of most thermal water in the Norris area. This\r\nis in contrast to the bead-like structures that result when geyserite\r\nforms from slightly alkaline water found in thermal features in the Old\r\nFaithful area.\r\n\r\nNotice too the variety of colors staining the basins. The refraction\r\n(breaking up) of light, mineral deposits and living organisms, algae and\r\nbacteria, all add their hues. The assortment of colors reflects\r\nvariations in water temperature and chemistry.\r\n\r\nAs you enjoy your walk remember that Norris is a great natural preserve\r\nwhere nature is constantly at work designing and redesigning one of its\r\nmost unusual displays. We are only visitors here and must not spoil it\r\nin any way. It also serves as a great natural research laboratory where\r\nscientists from all over the world learn more about geothermal energy.\r\nHelp us preserve this unique area so that the next generation and those\r\nwho follow can come and enjoy it in the same grandeur you did.\r\n\r\nThe Norris Geyser Basin is made up of two or more less separate areas\r\ncalled Porcelain Basin and Back Basin. Both basins are served by trails\r\nwhich begin at the Norris Museum and are shown on this map. The\r\nfollowing briefly describes a few features in each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THERMAL FEATURES IN PORCELAIN BASIN\r\n\r\n\r\nVALENTINE GEYSER—Located at the base of a large pear-shaped alcove,\r\nValentine is a typical cone type geyser that first erupted on\r\nValentine’s Day, 1907. Its activity has varied considerably—being\r\ndormant some seasons, erratic during others, yet showing a high degree\r\nof regularity at times. During the past several seasons, it has erupted\r\nfrom a minimum of once every two days to a maximum of once a day. An\r\neruption lasts 5-7 minutes and reaches a height of 20-50 feet (6-15 m.)\r\nabove the seven foot cone. The eruption is followed by a steam phase\r\nlasting an hour.\r\n\r\nLEDGE GEYSER—The largest geyser in the Porcelain Basin, changed\r\ndramatically after an earthquake that occurred June 30, 1975. In 1974 it\r\nhad been erupting about twice a day, but after the quake Ledge was\r\ndormant for nearly two years. Then during the summer of 1977 it had but\r\ntwo eruptions. Check the prediction board at the museum to see if Ledge\r\nGeyser is active this year.\r\n\r\nAFRICA GEYSER—named for the spring that preceded it which was roughly\r\nthe shape of the continent. The spring became a geyser in February of\r\n1971. At first it was intermittent but as time passed the periods\r\nbetween eruptions grew shorter until it became a constant geyser. In\r\n1977 it was always powerful—sometimes emitting a mixture of steam and\r\nwater; other times just steam.\r\n\r\nTHE WHIRLIGIGS AND CONSTANT GEYSERS—these three features seem to be\r\ninterconnected. Constant Geyser, dormant for several years, reactivated\r\nin the early ’70’s and now erupts up to 30 feet (9 m.) once or twice an\r\nhour; often prior to an eruption of one of the Whirligigs. In recent\r\nyears, Big and Little Whirligig have traded active periods. When one is\r\nmore active, the other is less. Watch for the 15 foot (4 m.) angled\r\nplume from Little Whirligig’s orange vent or listen to the distinctive\r\nchugging produced during Big Whirligig’s splashing eruption. As with\r\nmany geysers, the water level rises in these pools prior to an eruption.\r\n\r\nEBONY AND BEAR DEN GEYSERS—are another set of related features. In the\r\n’60’s Bear Den Geyser first appeared and as it increased in activity,\r\nEbony Geyser became dormant. Today Bear Den Geyser erupts in bursts,\r\narcing up to 40 feet (12 m.) from the den-like vent, four to six times\r\ndaily. The death of Ebony Geyser may have been hastened by objects\r\nthrown into its vent by thoughtless visitors. This debris is cemented\r\ninto place by the silica deposited from the water, choking off the vent.\r\nMinute Geyser in the Back Basin may have suffered a similar fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THERMAL FEATURES IN BACK BASIN\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERALD SPRING—The colors in and around thermal features are often\r\ncreated by several kinds of algae that grow in hot water. However, the\r\ndeep green color of this spring is a result of a combination of the\r\nyellow color from the sulphur lining the edge of the pool with the blue\r\nthat is refracted (“scattered”) from the clear water in the pool. The\r\nbowl of this feature is about 27 feet (8 m.) deep and the temperature\r\nnormally varies between 194 and 200 degrees F. (90-93° C.)\r\n\r\nSTEAMBOAT GEYSER—The world’s largest geyser, Steamboat has eruptions of\r\nmore than 300 feet (91 meters). It was largely dormant for nine years,\r\nthen startled observers in March 1978 with a full-scale eruption. The\r\nwater phase lasted approximately 20 minutes, followed by bellowing steam\r\nfor over 40 hours. This spectacular display inundated the immediate\r\narea. At this writing, March 30, 1978, it is not known if Steamboat’s\r\neruptions will follow any pattern. Between 1961 and March 1969, it had a\r\ntotal of 103 major eruptions, none of which could be predicted. You can\r\nstill see the effects of downpouring water on the landscape which killed\r\ntrees and scoured away soil. The nine-year respite allowed new lodgepole\r\npines to gain a foothold. We hope you are fortunate enough to witness\r\nSteamboat Geyser and share in the excitement. Remember—protect camera\r\nand eye glass lenses from the spray as it can scratch glass after\r\ndrying.\r\n\r\nCISTERN SPRING—In 1966 this feature changed from a grayish-black color\r\nto its present brilliant blue. Concurrent with this the overflow\r\nincreased killing many trees near the spring. Since then a silica\r\nterrace has rapidly built up. When Steamboat had a major eruption the\r\nwater level in Cistern dropped 4-8 feet, (1.2-2.4 m.) with a\r\ncorresponding drop in water temperature of around 60 degrees F. This\r\nseems to indicate some connection between the two features. Whether or\r\nnot the increased water output of Cistern has resulted in the decline of\r\nSteamboat is still unknown.\r\n\r\nECHINUS GEYSER (ē-kī′-nŭs)—although not as well known as some other\r\ngeysers, erupts in a display that surpasses many of them. The name comes\r\nfrom the sinter spine-covered rocks surrounding the pool which bear a\r\nfanciful resemblance to spiny sea urchins. _Echinus_ was the Greek name\r\nfor these tide-pool dwellers. Stop and watch the water fill the basin\r\nand begin to boil. Soon it will be propelled skyward in great explosive\r\nbursts of steam and water, some reaching heights of over 75 feet (23\r\nm.). Usually the eruptions last three to six minutes but in 1977 Echinus\r\nwas erupting for up to twelve minutes. After erupting the pool drains\r\nand begins to refill. Intervals between eruptions may be as short as 45\r\nminutes or better than 75 minutes. Listen for the peculiar gurgling\r\nsound produced as the vent drains after each eruption.\r\n\r\nVIXEN GEYSER—Although its usual eruptions are small compared to others\r\n(5-15 feet every few minutes), the geyser is unique in that water comes\r\nfrom a circular tub-like vent. During normal activity little water is\r\nejected. Occasionally Vixen may have major eruptions of considerable\r\nwater, lasting 5 to 50 minutes and playing up to 30 feet. Listen for the\r\npeculiar gurgling sound produced as the vent drains after each eruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       TODAY’S GEYSER PREDICTIONS\r\n\r\n(Obtain data from the museum prediction board or from a naturalist).\r\n\r\n  Echinus          ______________________________\r\n  Ledge            ______________________________\r\n  Valentine        ______________________________\r\n  Others           ______________________________\r\n                   ______________________________\r\n                   ______________________________\r\n\r\n    Text written by George A.
