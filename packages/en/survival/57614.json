I\r\nmention this in no spirit of pride,--quite the contrary,--but because\r\nsome may choose to trace in these adventures evidence of hereditary\r\ntendencies.\r\n\r\nOn the eighteenth day of August, 1886, as the sun was setting, I was\r\nfloating in the Caribbean Sea. You may mark the place on the map as\r\nbeing approximately N. latitude 15°, and W. longitude 62° from\r\nGreenwich; or in other words, between one hundred and two hundred miles\r\nwest of the French island of Martinique. A chest, well corded but partly\r\nfilled with water, was all that kept my head above the surface. Without\r\nfood or drink I had been floating thus since shortly after sunrise of\r\nthe previous morning. At that time the sloop in which I was voyaging,\r\ncapsized and sunk in a squall, drowning the negro captain and owner, and\r\nhis son, who constituted the crew. In this little vessel I was bound for\r\na small uninhabited island known as “Key Seven,” which was in plain\r\nsight when the disaster occurred. For two days and a night, without\r\nsleep or refreshment, I had been struggling to push the floating chest\r\ntoward this land.\r\n\r\nNow as the sun was just about to sink exactly behind the trees on the\r\nisland, I was so near that the sound of the waves on the beach reached\r\nmy ear. The tide would soon turn, and I must gain a foothold on the sand\r\nbefore the ebb got fairly under way, or continue the struggle another\r\nnight. My hands and arms were sore in places from chafing in the salt\r\nwater against the chest, every muscle ached, cramps and pains shot\r\nincessantly through every limb, my eyes were on fire, the wolf of hunger\r\ngnawed at my stomach, my lips and mouth and throat were parched and dry.\r\nThe fever of utter exhaustion and fatigue drove delirious dreams and\r\nfancies through my aching brain. Still on, on, on, compelling the\r\nunwilling and rebellious muscles to their automatic work, made sickening\r\nto the very soul by long continued repetition, I fought until at last my\r\nfeet rested on the bottom. One final struggle and the wave left me with\r\nthe chest upon the beach. But it was not until the last ounce of energy\r\nhad been expended, that I staggered and fell on the dry sand among the\r\nparched bladder-weed that streaked the shore. There I lay for half an\r\nhour, completely exhausted.\r\n\r\nWhen I rose to secure the chest by dragging it a little way--a very\r\nlittle way--beyond the reach of the waves, the sun had just sunk, night\r\nwith tropical suddenness had fallen on the scene, and the stars burst\r\nout in all their brilliancy in the clear dark vault of heaven.\r\n\r\nHere then I was at last at the end of my voyage, but in what a plight.\r\nFood and drink and sleep I must have, and that speedily, or death would\r\nshortly claim me. It was starlight, but too dark to see more than the\r\ndim outlines of things. I lay down again on the warm dry sand and tried\r\nto think what was best to do; but I could not think, for my dry tongue\r\nrattled in my mouth and my head ached as though it would burst with\r\nevery feeble throb of the heart.\r\n\r\nAs I lay with my face turned toward the sea, listening in despair to the\r\nsoft, monotonous lip-lipping of the waves, varied at regular intervals\r\nby the long, foaming crash of the swell as it broke and swept up the\r\nsands, there came presently in the eastern sky a faint silvery glow, and\r\nthe full moon stole up from out the glistening water until it shone full\r\nand broad, making a burnished path down to the shore at my feet. No\r\ndoubt, this saved my life. In an hour it was almost as light as day. I\r\nuntied my shoes, which I had fastened to the chest while swimming, put\r\nthem on to guard my feet, and started in search of drinking-water.\r\nFortunately it was close at hand. A little brook flowed down to the sea\r\nnot more than forty rods to the north of my landing-place. Had I been in\r\ncondition to remember anything, I should have known this fact, because\r\nwhile floating in the sea I noted this stream by the low foliage that\r\nmarked its course near the beach, and longed for a draught of the water\r\nwhich I knew must be there. Stumbling along the sands, I reached the\r\nstream, and lying down, buried my face in the clear, sweet water, and\r\ndrank until I could drink no more. This was possibly an imprudent thing\r\nto do. Indeed it was followed by dreadful nausea. But this did not\r\nhinder me from taking another draught, almost as deep as the first.\r\n\r\nHe who has not experienced real thirst can never know how delicious is\r\npure, sweet water, taken when every fibre and pore of the body is\r\nsuffering for it. Each capillary and duct seemed to expand, and the\r\nheart soon began to beat stronger and fuller as though under the lash of\r\na stimulant. Though I had fancied food was what I needed most, it was\r\nreally the water that my system demanded, and I felt at once so much\r\nstronger and better that a desire to sleep came upon me, the fever left\r\nmy veins, and I felt as though I could wait until morning before\r\nbreaking my fast.\r\n\r\nOn the way back to the chest I picked up half a dozen shell-fish of some\r\nbivalve species, on the sands at the edge of the surf, and ate them.\r\nThey tasted sweet as a nut to me, but were probably of little nutritious\r\nvalue, and possibly more or less indigestible. But they brought no harm,\r\nand seemed partly to fill what void the water had left.\r\n\r\nAt the landing-place I drew and rolled the chest still farther up the\r\nbeach, took off my wet clothing, spread it out to dry, and buried my\r\nbody in the warm sand, putting the chest between me and the gentle wind\r\nwhich was breathing steadily and softly in from the sea. Exhausted as I\r\nwas, the sense of bodily rest and warmth was delicious; but as is apt to\r\nbe the case when one is over-fatigued, sleep did not come to my eyelids.\r\nI was free from pain with the exception of the smarting of the raw\r\nwounds on my hands and arms, and lay listening to the rustling of the\r\nbreeze, the sound of the sea, and the lonesome call of a night bird or a\r\nsmall animal of some sort that occasionally broke the stillness.\r\n\r\nI thought over my desperate situation; of the disastrous ending of the\r\nvoyage, from which I had hoped so much; how and when, if ever, I could\r\nget off the island and back to civilization to take a fresh start,--for\r\nas to giving up the great object of the expedition, that thought was not\r\nonce entertained either then or at any other time. But now without a\r\nboat or the many necessary appliances for carrying out my plans, I could\r\nnot hope to accomplish that object, though I was upon the very island\r\nthat I had travelled over a thousand miles to reach. It would be\r\nnecessary to go back at least to Martinique, if not to New York, to\r\nobtain what I needed. Diving apparatus is not to be found everywhere.\r\nBesides the assistance of at least one person seemed absolutely\r\nnecessary, and here I was alone. Yes, I must somehow go back and start\r\nover again,--that seemed clear. But how, and when? These questions were\r\nnot easy to answer. Should I be able even to obtain food while a\r\nprisoner here, waiting such deliverance as chance might bring?\r\n\r\nThese and a thousand other thoughts passed through my mind while I lay\r\nlooking at the stars as they paled before the silver shield of the moon.\r\nI thought of my plans so carefully laid, and now, at least for the time\r\nbeing, so utterly defeated. Thus I reviewed mentally the whole history\r\nof the enterprise I had undertaken. And perhaps this is a proper place\r\nto give the reader an account of what he will doubtless conceive to be\r\nthe wildest scheme that ever was seriously contemplated. Listen, that\r\nyou may judge.\r\n\r\nOn my twenty-first birthday, now only a few weeks past, I sailed from\r\nNew York in one of the steamers plying to the Windward Islands, bound\r\nfor Martinique and thence by country sloop to Key Seven, for the purpose\r\nof finding a Spanish galleon that sank in the open sea near that island,\r\nJuly 9, 1665, after a bloody battle with two vessels commanded by the\r\nbuccaneer Welshman, Captain Henry Morgan. This galleon contained pieces\r\nof eight, gold and silver in bars and plate, and jewels, to the value of\r\nover three hundred thousand dollars. It had lain thus at the bottom of\r\nthe sea, as I believed, for more than two hundred years. To find this\r\nsunken wreck and secure the treasure was the object of my expedition.\r\nHow I succeeded in such a wild undertaking will appear hereafter.\r\n\r\nSeveral years before, while I was at college, a desultory course of\r\nreading had awakened in me a deep interest in the early printed\r\naccounts of the lawless buccaneers and maroons who infested the waters\r\nand coasts of the Caribbean Sea, besieged and sacked the Spanish forts\r\nand cities, crossed the isthmus of Darien, and followed down the coast\r\nof South America, capturing the vessels and laying waste the towns of\r\nthe Spaniards. Bartholomew Portuges, Brasiliano, John Davis, Francis\r\nLolonois, and Henry Morgan, the brother of my ancestor, were noted\r\nleaders of these buccaneering crews and armies. Perhaps the last-named\r\nadventurer, who led the desperate expedition across the isthmus and\r\ncaptured the fortified city of Panama, was the most noted of all, as he\r\nwas also not the least cruel, blood-thirsty, and avaricious. Fragmentary\r\naccounts by various authors, some of whom were actors in the scenes\r\ndescribed, have been published in Dutch, French, Spanish, and English.\r\nSo far as I could do so I had sought and studied these accounts. A\r\ntranslation into English, made more than a hundred years ago, of the\r\nmost considerable Dutch and French accounts had enabled me to absorb\r\nthem, and the numerous original reports of Spanish officials made to\r\ntheir government, and which are still preserved in the archives at\r\nMadrid, were rendered accessible to me by a fortunate circumstance.\r\n\r\nMany years ago most of the documents bearing upon the history of\r\nAmerica, from the time of Columbus down to the present century, had been\r\ncollected and transcribed through the efforts of an American author\r\nwhose charming histories have delighted all English readers. This mass\r\nof material had since its transcription been made use of by many others,\r\nand being in the charge of the college librarian, I obtained access to\r\nit. My enthusiasm may be imagined, when I say that in order to consult\r\nthese transcriptions I actually learned to read Spanish. It was in one\r\nof these papers that I found the report of Don Josef Isabel del Velo y\r\nCampo, admiral of the Spanish fleet and at the time in command of the\r\nSpanish galleon La Magdalen. The admiral gave a full account of the loss\r\nof this galleon, of the desperate battle, of the tremendous bravery of\r\nthe Spaniards under his command, and of his own escape with two others\r\nby swimming to the island of Trebucino near by. The vessel sank about a\r\nmile from the northern extremity of the island, bearing a little east of\r\nnorth from the point of rocks. The report was accompanied by an account\r\nof the cargo on board, as nearly correct as his memory and knowledge\r\ncould serve him to give, and by a like statement of the money and\r\ntreasure lost, concluding with a pious congratulation that if lost to\r\nSpain it at least had not fallen into the hands of Morgan and his\r\nmurderous _hereticos_.\r\n\r\nAt the time of reading this report, it was to me a matter of idle\r\nwonder, to conjecture whether the noble galleon still held together at\r\nthe bottom of the sea, and if the treasure was still there; to picture\r\nthe many curious things that possibly lived and grew near the blackened\r\nand corroded silver and the untarnishable gold, the monsters of the sea\r\nthat swam and crept over and about it, the seaweed, the sponge and the\r\ncoral, the tides and the currents which swept by it, and the drowned\r\nsailors and cavaliers whose spirits possibly guarded it through the slow\r\nages of decay and change.\r\n\r\nAlthough I had looked up the island of Trebucino on the old charts, and\r\nhad identified it as the bit of land now marked “Key Seven” on modern\r\nmaps, yet at that time I had no thought of the possibility of recovering\r\nthe treasure, much less of engaging in such a hair-brained enterprise\r\nmyself. It was not until long afterward that the idea entered my mind of\r\nseeking the treasure, and then it was suggested by a serious misfortune\r\nthat befell me.\r\n\r\nBoth my parents were dead, and I had no living relatives nearer than an\r\nuncle, my mother’s brother, who was my guardian, and who from time to\r\ntime sent me money as I needed it. When my father died he left his\r\nestate, consisting of valuable farming lands in the beautiful Mohawk\r\nvalley, heavily encumbered with debt. The money sent me for expenses at\r\ncollege came from a small property that had belonged to my mother. I had\r\nalways looked forward to the day when, free from school life, I could\r\nundertake the management and control of my father’s farms, and return to\r\nlive at the home farm, where I was born and where my early boyhood days\r\nwere passed. The old Dutch-built brick house with its noble elms, the\r\nbrook that ran through the meadow, so near that its murmur could be\r\nheard on still summer nights from my open bedroom window, the broad\r\nfields stretching up and down the valley as far as the eye could reach,\r\nthe thousand acres under cultivation, and the thousand more of woodland\r\nand pasture, the sleek herds, the dairy, and all the joys of a farmer’s\r\nlife, made up the picture which was ever in my mind. To live this life\r\nhad been my ambition, and I had tolerated school only because I was told\r\nit would better fit me for the work.\r\n\r\nBut all my hopes were suddenly dashed by a letter from my uncle advising\r\nme to be economical and saving with my money, as there was only seven\r\nhundred dollars left of the fund devoted to my education, and the whole\r\nof which he would in six months turn over to me in one sum. He told me I\r\nwas now old enough to be informed of my exact prospects. It was better,\r\nhe said, I should know that my father’s estate would not sell for nearly\r\nenough to clear the mortgages on it, that it would require at least a\r\nhundred thousand dollars to meet and pay a debt due in three years. He\r\noffered to manage the property for me up to that time; but warned me\r\nthat I could hope to realize but little from it, and that it would then\r\nhave to go under the hammer. By this sad and unexpected news, my\r\nprospects in life were wholly changed. The thought of losing my old home\r\nand all the familiar surroundings was so dismal and distressing that I\r\nhad no heart left to finish my college work. Could I not somehow get the\r\nnecessary money to redeem the property? This thought came to me over and\r\nover. To get a hundred thousand dollars in the short space of three\r\nyears! Alas! the accomplishment of such a feat must involve some\r\nextraordinary circumstances as well as great good-fortune. It was while\r\nthus cudgelling my brains in despair, that the idea of the Spanish\r\ngalleon recurred to me. After weighing the whole matter coolly, and\r\nwithout any enthusiasm or prejudice, I concluded that there was a bare\r\nchance of raising this sunken treasure from the sea. I resolved to take\r\nthat remote chance, and to spend my money and the three years, if\r\nnecessary, in the endeavor.\r\n\r\nIt would be six months before I could get the seven hundred dollars that\r\nremained to me. This period I spent in planning and studying the\r\nenterprise, and in such physical preparation as I was able to make.\r\nEvery day I visited the natatorium and gymnasium to practise swimming\r\nand to train and develop the muscles; so that when the six months had\r\npassed I was an expert swimmer and diver and my muscles were hard as\r\nsteel. The money came duly to hand, and I left college at once for New\r\nYork City.\r\n\r\nThere, after writing to my uncle that I was about to go on a voyage that\r\nmight last three years, and bidding him an affectionate farewell, I\r\nbought such articles and appliances as I had determined would be\r\nnecessary, and took passage for Martinique with exactly two hundred\r\ndollars in my pocket.\r\n\r\nThen came, as we have seen, the wreck of the sloop, the drowning of my\r\nnegro assistants, and my long struggle in the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE FOOD SUPPLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun was well up the eastern sky when I awoke in the morning, so numb\r\nand stiff that I could with difficulty unbury myself from the sand, the\r\nweight of which had almost stopped the circulation in some parts of the\r\nbody. My clothing, which I had spread on the sand, had completely dried.\r\nAfter some chafing and rubbing I dressed myself and felt more\r\ncomfortable than at any time since the loss of the sloop. The first\r\nthing to do was to get something to eat. I walked to the brook, bathed\r\nmy face, and took a long drink of water, and began to be more and more\r\nimpressed with the fact that the diet was thin. There were a number of\r\ncocoanut palms near by, growing within a few rods of the sea, and plenty\r\nof nuts on them, as could be plainly seen. But though I searched the\r\nground with hungry glance I could find only one nut that had not been\r\noperated on by the land crabs, which are able in an ingenious manner to\r\nextract the contents through the three little eyes or holes in the\r\nshell. This one nut, the exterior husk of which had not been disturbed,\r\nI broke open by pounding it upon a rock, and found it to my bitter\r\ndisappointment blackened, rancid, and quite unfit for food.\r\n\r\nI had noticed a flock of gulls, or some species of shore birds, wheeling\r\nabout and lighting and running on the beach near by. With a shotgun it\r\nwould have been an easy matter to creep near and bag half a dozen at a\r\nshot. I watched them a little while and concluded that though it might\r\nprove a tough and unpalatable dish I must have one, or starve. It would\r\nbe a good plan, I thought, to gather a dozen pebbles weighing three or\r\nfour ounces apiece and try the effect of a shot into the thick of the\r\nflock from as near a point as I could reach. But as there would be no\r\nchance for more than one trial, I determined to fire the stones in a\r\nvolley. To do this effectively I gathered some tough reeds and tied one\r\nto each stone until I had half a dozen stones so provided. By swinging\r\nthese missiles at the end of the reeds they could be thrown a\r\nconsiderable distance with great velocity.\r\n\r\nTrembling with expectation and excitement, I crept down toward the\r\nflock, keeping out of sight behind some rocks until I was as near as it\r\nwas possible to go, when I let fly my volley of improvised slung-shots\r\nas well as I could direct them into the thickest of the birds. Running\r\nforward immediately, I found two lying on the sand struggling. One was\r\nhit squarely on the wing with a stone, and the other had a reed wound\r\nonce around its neck. I secured both and wrung their necks. The idea at\r\nonce occurred to me that the next time I had occasion to hunt gulls, I\r\nwould contrive a bolas by tying a stone to each end of a cord; it seemed\r\nto me that this would prove even a more effectual instrument of\r\ndestruction than the sling volley, as it would be almost certain to\r\nentangle one or more of the flock.\r\n\r\nThese birds were nearly as large as a guillemot, but of what species I\r\ndo not know. As I had no fire to cook with, I immediately ate one of\r\nthem raw. The other I cut into strips and shreds and laid them on a rock\r\nin the hot sun to dry. The experience of eating a raw unseasoned gull\r\nwas such as to turn my thoughts forcibly to the necessity of some means\r\nfor procuring both fire and salt. The salt would not be difficult to\r\nobtain, for if it could not be found somewhere along the shore or in the\r\nsalt marsh near by, it would not be difficult to make some sort of a\r\nsalt pan provided I could find clay or other impermeable soil with which\r\nto confine a shallow pool of sea water somewhere in the sunshine. The\r\nevaporation would speedily give the small quantity I should require.\r\n\r\nIn my vest pocket was a small metal match-box half full of matches, such\r\nas every smoker carries. But on examination it proved, as might be\r\nexpected, that all the matches were wet and useless. Nevertheless when I\r\ngot back to the landing-place, I laid them carefully out in the sun on a\r\nstone to dry, thinking that possibly one of them might be made to light.\r\n\r\nI now turned my attention to the chest. This chest was one of four that\r\ncontained my baggage; but which one of the four, or what this particular\r\none contained, I could not conjecture. So I set about untying the rope\r\nwound around it, and soon had it free. There was fully forty feet of\r\nstrong hempen halyard stuff in the line, and this in itself was a\r\npossession of value. The bunch of keys in my pocket enabled me without\r\ntrouble to open the lock. When I raised the lid I found to my bitter\r\ndisappointment that the chest contained those articles which would be of\r\nleast value to me under the present circumstances. The contents\r\nconsisted chiefly of books, stationery, sketching appliances, drawing\r\ntools and materials, and a photographic camera and outfit. Everything\r\nwas, of course, soaked with water, and I hardly had the heart to take\r\nthe things out to dry. The books and paper, as well as the photographic\r\nplates, were in a sad condition. The bellows of the camera came to\r\npieces. I spread out the contents of the chest on the hot sand to dry,\r\nputting stones on such things as might blow away when they became\r\ndried. The lens of the camera I unscrewed, intending to use it as a\r\nburning-glass to start a fire, so that there might be no further need to\r\neat raw gull. The burning-glass, which was of priceless value to me, and\r\nthe rope were practically all the chest yielded that could be put to\r\nuse, as I then supposed. The chest itself would of course be useful to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nEager to try the burning-glass, I collected some dry branches, leaves,\r\nand other fuel. In a ball or nest of dry grass, of the size of my two\r\nfists, I placed a little bunch of silky seed fibres collected from a\r\nweed. Upon this fibre I brought to bear the focus of the lens,\r\nconcentrating the sun’s rays to an intense white spot, which almost\r\nimmediately began to smoke with the heat. Presently the material\r\ncommenced to burn, and I whirled the ball rapidly around through the\r\nair, whereupon the whole burst into a flame, which being placed among\r\nthe fuel was speedily a roaring fire. In this manner I obtained fire as\r\nlong as I remained on the island. As a mere matter of curiosity I tried\r\nsome of the matches which had been laid out so carefully to dry, but, as\r\nmight have been expected, not a single one would light. It was very\r\nfortunate, therefore, that I had the lens, as otherwise I should have\r\nbeen reduced to the necessity of rubbing sticks together in the manner\r\nof the savages, and probably without being able to get fire as they are\r\nsaid to do. Of course I did not need the fire to keep me warm, for the\r\nair was excessively hot. But it seemed so like a new-found friend that I\r\nbuilt it high, and when there was a mass of embers, carefully covered\r\nthem with sand and ashes that they might last and be ready for future\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nIt was now nearly noon and my stomach became more clamorous than ever. I\r\ntherefore cooked and ate the flesh of the other gull, which had been\r\nlaid on the rocks to be cured. Although the flies had begun to attack\r\nthe meat, it was, as yet, in no wise tainted, nor very dry. By dipping\r\nthe pieces into the sea water I gave it, as I fancied, a perceptible\r\nflavor of salt. At any rate, though tough and a little rank in flavor,\r\nit tasted good enough and my only regret was that there was not more of\r\nit. I could perceive the gulls in great numbers flying about out at sea,\r\nbut none on the shore, and concluded that they came to the land only at\r\ncertain stages of the tide,--probably at low tide, when their food would\r\nbe exposed.\r\n\r\nDetermined to lay in a store of provisions, I next turned my attention\r\nto the cocoanut palms and made another search for fallen nuts, but\r\nwithout any success, though I sought the whole length of the beach\r\nbeneath the trees. It became quite evident that to get the nuts I should\r\nhave to climb for them. As the nut-bearing trees were from fifty to\r\nseventy-five feet high, without a branch on their cylindrical stems from\r\nthe base up to the feathery crown, the climb was likely to prove a\r\ndifficult if not a dangerous task. However, selecting a palm with plenty\r\nof nuts on it, I made the attempt to “shin”--as the sailors call it,--up\r\nthe stem. It was hard work, and the heat was so oppressive that I had to\r\nstop several times and rest on the way up and was very glad when I found\r\nmyself at the top. I broke off and threw down a score of the nuts in all\r\nstages of ripeness, and then descended in safety.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the cocoanut palm grows in clusters of a dozen to twenty\r\nnuts in each bunch, which hang immediately under the crown of leaves.\r\nUpon the trees they by no means present the globular hard-shelled\r\nappearance which is familiar to our eyes. Each nut is encased in a thick\r\nfibrous rind or husk; exteriorly this husk is of a sub-triangular form,\r\nabout twelve inches long and six inches broad. Of the fibre of this\r\nexterior husk the well-known cocoanut matting is made, and also the\r\ncoarse yarn called cöir; it is also used for cordage.\r\n\r\nI carried the nuts to a shady place and stripped off the husk by means\r\nof a pointed piece of rock set upright in the ground. The smaller ones\r\nnot yet entirely ripe were full of a sweet liquid, and the meat was soft\r\nenough to have been scooped out with a spoon; the older ones were also\r\nvery good, not nearly so dry and hard as we find them in our northern\r\nmarkets. For the first time since the shipwreck I ate until my hunger\r\nwas fully appeased. What the result of a long-continued diet upon such\r\nfood would be I could not of course forecast, but it seemed probable\r\nthat I need not starve while the nuts were plentiful. Those which were\r\nleft from this meal I carried to the landing-place and laid them on the\r\nchest, where the land crabs would probably not get at them.\r\n\r\nWith this ample supply of food, presumably nutritious and certainly\r\nquite palatable, my anxiety was greatly relieved. Animal food I could\r\nprobably obtain from time to time as the island appeared to abound with\r\nbirds of various kinds, if I could have time to contrive some method of\r\nensnaring or killing them. Then too there were doubtless fish to be\r\ncaught, and probably turtle. In some of the islands, I knew, there were\r\nwild pigs, as it was a common thing for the people of Martinique to come\r\nto these small isolated islands on pig-hunting expeditions. I sincerely\r\nhoped that these animals might be found on Key Seven; for I felt quite\r\nconfident of my ability to think of some plan for killing or capturing\r\nthem. But there was no immediate need to go fishing or hunting for birds\r\nor pigs.\r\n\r\nI determined to find, if possible, some means of getting a supply of\r\nsalt before I sought for flesh food of any kind. With this end in view,\r\nas the afternoon was still young, I began looking about for a suitable\r\nplace to serve as a salt pan. I walked along the beach for a mile each\r\nway, but could find no suitable spot. The requirements were a shallow\r\nbasin near the sea, with the bottom impervious to water, which should\r\nhold in a shallow depth at least five or ten barrels of water. There was\r\nplenty of rock of a coralline limestone variety, and an abundance of\r\nshells; and the idea occurred to me that I might burn a supply of lime\r\nand thus make a mortar or cement of slaked lime and sand. With this\r\nmaterial it would be possible to construct just above high-water mark\r\nsuch a pan or cavity as I desired. If I used shells to make the lime,\r\nthere would probably be no need of erecting a kiln, as heat enough could\r\nbe attained in a large open fire, by building it of several alternate\r\nlayers of dry wood and shells.\r\n\r\nI immediately set about collecting shells with which the beach was most\r\nplentifully strewn in all directions. As I had nothing in which to carry\r\nthem, I adopted the expedient of throwing them one at a time into heaps.\r\nThis was very hard and fatiguing work, and it was four o’clock or later\r\nin the afternoon before I had gathered into about twenty different heaps\r\nthe four or five bushels of shells which I thought enough for a burning.\r\nIt still remained for me to collect the scattered heaps together, and\r\ngather the wood for fuel.\r\n\r\nBut it was high time now to stop work and prepare for the night. Some\r\nsort of sleeping-place must be contrived in the two or three hours of\r\ndaylight that remained, for I had no fancy to try again the sort of\r\ncouch I had last slept in. I went to the stream and drank a good draught\r\nof water, a welcome refreshment after my exertion in the hot sun. I then\r\ngathered a quantity of dry grass for a bed and carried it down to the\r\nsand near the landing-place, which seemed a sort of home to me, although\r\nI had resolved speedily thereafter to move my property nearer to the\r\nbrook. The contents of the chest were now dry excepting the books, which\r\npresented a sad appearance. I gathered all of these things together and\r\ncovered them up as well as I could with the focussing-cloth that\r\nbelonged to the camera, piling stones around the edge to secure it. The\r\nempty chest I turned up on its side, hinges uppermost, and propped up\r\nthe lid in a nearly horizontal position. This would afford me shelter\r\nfor the upper portion of the body. Under the shelter thus improvised I\r\npiled the dry grass for a couch, and my sleeping-place was ready. I then\r\ngathered a fresh supply of fuel and built up a fire on the landward,\r\nwhich would presently be the leeward side of my shelter.\r\n\r\nBy the time these arrangements were all complete, the sun was setting.\r\nTired out, I lay down and watched the fire, thinking over my situation\r\nand planning what to do and how to do it. No doubt, sooner or later some\r\nvessel would pass in sight or land on the island and take me off. It was\r\nnot as though I were on a remote or inaccessible place; the native\r\nsloops and small vessels occasionally visited these islands for wood or\r\nturtle, or on pig-hunting expeditions, and I fancied it would not be\r\nlong before an opportunity offered for my escape. In the meantime, while\r\nthus a prisoner, be the time long or short, it would be necessary to\r\nkeep up my health and strength. For this purpose food and shelter were\r\nnecessary, and occupation, too, that I might not brood over my situation\r\nand worry at the delay in my plans. There was likely to be plenty of\r\noccupation, however, in providing myself with the bare necessities of\r\nlife. If there should be any spare time on my hands I would devote it\r\nto the construction of a boat, a raft, or a vessel of some other sort,\r\nwith which to get away. But with only a pocket knife how could I expect\r\never to build a boat capable of navigating more than a hundred miles of\r\nsea? How could I carry fresh water enough to last during the voyage?\r\n\r\nThese problems were indeed difficult of solution. I ran over in my mind,\r\nas far as I could recollect them, all the different kinds of boats,\r\ncanoes, kayaks, etc., known to primitive man. There was the ancient\r\ncoracle, used by the old Britons, woven in basket fashion from willows\r\nand coated with clay or lined with a hide,--a thing good enough in an\r\nemergency to ferry one over a stream, but utterly useless to me. There\r\nwas the canoe or pirogue, hollowed from a single tree-trunk,--called\r\nalso the dugout. Possibly by the aid of fire I might with patience\r\nconstruct such a thing by months of hard work; and by adding an\r\noutrigger log or float, after the manner of the South-Sea islanders,\r\nsuch a canoe could possibly be rendered capable of navigating the sea in\r\nfavorable weather. Then again there was the whole class of skin boats\r\nsuch as the Esquimaux use; the Greenlander’s kayak made of skins\r\nstretched over a framework, and “decked over” like a modern canoe. But\r\nhow could I build a boat without tools to work with?\r\n\r\nI lay thus for an hour or two watching the embers and thinking over one\r\nplan after another, until I felt inclined to sleep. When I turned over\r\nwith my back to the fire, I could see along the beach where the\r\nmoonlight glinted and sparkled on the sand and shells and pebbles,\r\ntinging each wave with liquid silver, as it ran up in graceful curves\r\nupon the sand.\r\n\r\nI was looking on this scene of magic beauty with the soft fingers of\r\nsleep just ready to press down my eyelids when I saw what I thought was\r\na rock just in the wash of the breakers, begin slowly to move. Was this\r\na fancy or was it a fact?\r\n\r\nI roused myself and watched the object intently. Yes, it was slowly\r\nmoving out of the water upon the sand. I realized instantly that it was\r\na turtle making for the sand in order to lay her eggs. Here was a good\r\nsupply of meat which could be kept an indefinite time, to be obtained by\r\nthe simple process of turning the creature on its back.\r\n\r\nI watched the creature crawl slowly up in the moonlight until it was\r\nfour or five rods from the water, and waited a minute to see if it would\r\ngo further. Then I quietly reached for a piece of wood which might be\r\nused as a lever to help me turn it over, and ran as swiftly as I could\r\nfor about three hundred yards so as to get between it and the sea. But\r\nthe turtle did not seem to comprehend the situation, at least it did not\r\nmove until I ran close up to it and thrust the stick beneath it. Then it\r\nbegan to walk away, and as it did so it rose up on its fins to such a\r\nheight that my lever slipped and turned, and I could get no purchase on\r\nit. I immediately made up my mind that turtle are not to be turned with\r\na lever. So dropping the stick, I seized the shell with both hands and\r\nwith a mighty effort heaved the creature over on its back as skilfully\r\nas though I had been a veteran turtle-turner.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I had regained my breath, I scraped away the stones and sand\r\nuntil there was a level space around the turtle, so that it could not\r\npossibly work itself over again, and then contemplated my prize. It was\r\na magnificent specimen of the hawk’s-bill variety of sea turtle, and\r\nwould doubtless weigh one hundred and fifty pounds. Visions of turtle\r\nsoup and steaks floated through my mind. But I could not afford to kill\r\nthis great creature until I had salt with which to preserve the meat;\r\notherwise I could not hope to consume a tenth of it before it would\r\nspoil.\r\n\r\nQuite content with this piece of good-luck, I returned to my shelter\r\nand, lying down, kept watch for another such prize; but none came, and\r\nafter an hour or two my eyelids grew heavy again,--and the glitter of\r\nthe moonlight on the sand, and the ceaseless motion of the waves, seemed\r\nto mingle together in a swimming confusion, until I lost myself and the\r\nmoonlit waves and shore together in a dreamless sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nHOUSE-BUILDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nBright and early the next morning I awoke to what I felt must be a busy\r\nday. A plunge in the sea, a good bath in the brook, and a frugal\r\nbreakfast of cocoanuts consumed but a few minutes of the time, which,\r\nbeing now practically my sole capital, must be expended with due regard\r\nto economy. The turtle was lying safe on its back, and as the sun would\r\nsoon be very hot, my first care was to break off some shrubs and erect a\r\nshade for the creature. I should have been glad to pour a few buckets of\r\nsea water over it, but buckets were not among my present conveniences.\r\n\r\nThe first work on hand was of course the lime-burning. I found a great\r\npiece of bark, which I loosened from a fallen and partially decayed log,\r\nand used as a sort of tray on which to carry the separate heaps of\r\nshells to the spot where the burning was to be done. To economize time\r\nand labor, I concluded to burn the lime at the spot where I should\r\nsubsequently want it. I selected for this purpose a flat piece of smooth\r\nsand free of stones and just above high tide, where the waves could not\r\nin ordinary weather wash into it. With my hands and pieces of bark I\r\nscooped out a basin about ten feet square and a foot in depth, throwing\r\nthe sand up all around in a low bank. In this basin I piled dry wood and\r\nthe shells in layers until the pile was five or six feet high.\r\n\r\nThis took me until noon, working hard every minute, with the\r\nperspiration streaming from every pore. Then I discovered that my fire\r\nwas out. But I had no trouble to start another with the burning-glass,\r\nas the sun was shining fiercely and so directly overhead that I had to\r\nsearch for my shadow. Presently the great flames were roaring and\r\nleaping high in the air and casting out such a heat that I was glad to\r\nretire to the brook for a drink and a cocoanut lunch while waiting for\r\nthe fuel to burn out.\r\n\r\nAs I rested in the shade, I employed myself in twisting or rudely\r\nspinning some cord out of the fibre of the cocoanut husks. I first\r\npounded the husk between two stones until the fibre was reduced to a\r\nmass resembling coarse hemp, and then began to draw it out and twist it\r\nas one twists a hay band, only into a slenderer thread. As fast as it\r\nbecame twisted, I wound the thread on a short stick about six inches\r\nlong and a quarter of an inch in diameter. With the cord wound smoothly\r\non this stick, and a half-hitch taken around one end, I could roll the\r\ncord and stick between my hand and leg to give the twist necessary for\r\nthe spinning operation, and at the same time use the other hand to\r\nmanipulate the entangling fibres. By this simple process it was possible\r\nto produce the thread, or cöir, quite rapidly.\r\n\r\nIn about an hour and a half my great fire was burned to the ground, and\r\nas a result there lay in the shallow excavation a mingled mass of\r\nembers, ashes, lime, fragments of partly burned shells, wood, and\r\ncharcoal. Of course the ground beneath was very hot, and I could not\r\nwork among the embers and hot fragments. The tide was now beginning to\r\ncome in, and I dug a trench from the pit to the sea, through which the\r\nwater flowed till it quenched the fire and slaked the lime, and partly\r\nsinking in the porous sand, left: a muddy compound of lime, ashes, and\r\nsand, all over the bottom of the pit. I filled and plastered up the\r\ntrench except a narrow gateway, cleaned out the sticks and fragments,\r\nand sprinkled dry sand over the mud, raking it well in and smoothing the\r\nsurface as much as possible with the aid of sticks and a great\r\nclam-shell. It now remained for me only to let the cement or mortar set\r\nand dry, and then, I hoped, it would prove impervious to water.\r\n\r\nThere were still some hours of daylight, which could not be better\r\nemployed, I thought, than upon the construction of some better shelter\r\nthan the upturned chest had afforded. All day I had been turning over in\r\nmy mind a plan for a hut or shanty that I fancied might be quickly and\r\neasily built. There was no telling how long the fair weather, which had\r\nnow lasted for several days, might continue, and the utter wretchedness\r\nof existence if a storm should find me without a shelter was not to be\r\npatiently contemplated.\r\n\r\nIn gathering fuel near the edge of the forest I had noticed a great\r\nquantity of dead stalks standing six or seven feet high, straight as an\r\narrow and perhaps an inch and a half in diameter except where they\r\ntapered at the top. The plant looked like some species of hibiscus. Any\r\nquantity of these stalks was to be had, and they were light yet strong\r\nenough for my purpose.\r\n\r\nI selected a nice level piece of dry sand near the stream and fifty\r\nyards or so from the sea as a site for my proposed house. The shadow\r\nfrom a clump of cocoanut palms fell upon the spot for a part of the day,\r\nand near by was a bit of rock where I had sat at noon spinning cöir. Two\r\nyoung palms grew there about eight feet apart, the trunks of which would\r\nserve for the main supports of the structure. I hunted about in the\r\nforest until I found a reasonably straight stick, that would reach from\r\none of these trees to the other, to serve as a ridgepole, and lashed it\r\nfirmly to them with some of my cocoanut cord, about eight feet from the\r\nground. Then I brought hibiscus stalks, taking care to cut their butts\r\ndiagonally. They were easily severed by a single blow. These stalks I\r\nset upright in the sand; as firmly as possible, for the four walls of\r\nthe hut, each wall consisting of two rows, the inner row being planted\r\nclose together and the outer row parallel to it at a distance of about\r\nan inch and a half, the stalks of the outer row being separated from one\r\nanother three or four inches.\r\n\r\nWhen they were set up, which did not take long as I made no effort to\r\ndrive them very firmly in the sand, I cut off the tops of the stalks\r\nforming the end walls to the shape that the roof was subsequently to\r\ntake, and reduced the side walls to a common level. In the side next the\r\nsea I left an opening for a doorway. The space between the rows of\r\nstalks it was my intention to fill with dry grass laid horizontally, and\r\nto lay in at intervals stalks of hibiscus, finishing off the top of the\r\nwalls with a good stout stalk of the same, laid in all around and lashed\r\nto both rows with cord. This, I thought, would make a reasonably stout\r\nand weatherproof wall, and so it subsequently turned out. But as night\r\ncame on at this stage of the work, I could not complete even the walls\r\nof my hut before dark, and was fain to content myself with my bed under\r\nthe chest.\r\n\r\nI was awakened from a sound sleep by something crawling over me.\r\nForgetful of where I was, I sprang up erect, and my head, coming\r\nviolently in contact with the chest, overturned it, while I fell back\r\nhalf stunned with the blow. The moon had gone down and the stars were\r\nshining brightly, but there was not light enough to see anything\r\ndistinctly except on the water, where a phosphorescent gleam lighted up\r\nthe breaking waves with a pale greenish glow which ran in streaks along\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I could collect my scattered senses and get upon my feet, I\r\nbegan to grope around in search of the cause of the disturbance.\r\nPresently a loathsome, warty, tuberculous land crab scuttled over my\r\nnaked foot, and I could then make out literally hundreds of shadowy\r\nforms sidling over the sand. There was no more sleep for me that night,\r\nand I was glad to think from the appearance of the sky that it was not\r\nmore than two hours before the dawn. As I had already been sleeping for\r\neight or ten hours I felt rested, but was faint with hunger. Cocoanut no\r\nlonger had an attraction for me, but as there was nothing else at hand I\r\nforced myself to eat enough to relieve my faintness. A good cup of\r\ncoffee or even a bowl of hot soup would have seemed a fortune to me\r\nthen, but I was obliged to be satisfied with a deep draught of water,\r\nwhich lay in my stomach sensibly cold and heavy. It was evident that\r\nthere was no time to lose in getting more nutritious food than\r\ncocoanuts, if I was to keep my strength. This determined me to kill the\r\nturtle that very morning, without waiting for the slow operation of the\r\nsalt pan even if it proved ready to fill with sea water that day; for\r\nthe evaporation of such an amount of water might take several days\r\nbefore the residue was salt enough for brine. I went to look at the\r\ncaptive and found it as I had left it the day before.\r\n\r\nI watched the eastern horizon patiently for signs of dawn. Finally a\r\ngray pale glow lit up the sky and slowly changed to a tender pink and\r\nprimrose, then suddenly the golden rim of the sun shot up and daylight\r\nas suddenly took the place of night. The streaks and wreaths of mist\r\nthat lay sleeping in the hollows of the waves floated away and\r\ndissolved.\r\n\r\nIt did not take me long to kill and dress the turtle, and to pack the\r\nmeat, both callipash and callipee,--as the two sorts composing a\r\nturtle’s anatomy are termed,--into the upper shell and to cover it up\r\nwith the breast plate. I now resolved to have some hot turtle soup.\r\n\r\nAmong the photographic apparatus were two shallow developing-trays, made\r\nof sheet iron and lined with porcelain. They were about an inch in depth\r\nand six by ten inches in their lateral dimensions. While these would\r\nserve well enough perhaps to stew or fry the meat in, they did not hold\r\nenough to make soup. There was, however, a large glass bottle holding a\r\ngallon, filled with a solution of hyposulphite of soda to be used as a\r\nfixing solution for photographic negatives. This I emptied and washed\r\nthoroughly with sand and water until it was perfectly clean. Cutting\r\nsome of the meat into small fragments, I put them into the bottle until\r\nit was a third full, then filled it with equal parts of sea water and\r\nfresh water, as this proportion seemed to taste about salt enough. I\r\nthen set the bottle in the hot ashes until the contents were warm,\r\ngradually moving it nearer and nearer the fire, until finally all was so\r\nhot that I no longer feared the heat would crack the glass; so, drawing\r\nout some embers, I set the bottle boldly upon them, where the water soon\r\nbegan to simmer and gently boil. In the mean time, I stewed some of the\r\nmeat with sea water in a developing-tray for immediate consumption, and\r\nof this made a good breakfast.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast I examined the salt pan to see if the cement had set\r\nsufficiently, but found that the mortar was still somewhat friable and\r\nnot hard though seemingly quite dry. I concluded, therefore, to let it\r\nharden for another twenty-four hours before putting it to the test; but\r\nto obtain a small supply of salt for immediate use I filled the two\r\ndeveloping trays with sea water and set them on the fire to boil.\r\n\r\nWhen these operations were fairly under way, I resumed the\r\nhouse-building. First I gathered a great quantity of coarse, dry grass\r\nin the bottom land of the creek and laid it in the walls in the manner\r\nalready described. When this was completed to my satisfaction, I began\r\nthe construction of the roof after the following fashion: From the\r\nridgepole to the side walls I laid at intervals of six inches\r\nhibiscus-stalk rafters, securing them in place at both ends by hay bands\r\ntwisted out of the dry, tough grass, the lower ends of the rafters\r\nprojecting to form eaves. On these rafters and parallel to the ridgepole\r\nI tied in like manner other stalks, at intervals of six inches. Here was\r\na light and reasonably strong framework ready to receive a thatching of\r\ngrass or palm leaves, but I concluded that grass would be preferable as\r\nit would make a roof better calculated to resist the wind.\r\n\r\nNight was now approaching, and as the weather seemed as settled as ever,\r\nthe lack of the thatch would be no special hardship. I hurried therefore\r\nto drag my chest up to the house and arrange my bed of grass within the\r\nwalls, guarding against another intrusion of the land crabs by means of\r\na row of short hibiscus stalks across the doorway. The result of the\r\nday’s boiling of sea water in my developing-trays was something over a\r\ntablespoonful of salt. The soup which had been simmering all day in the\r\nbottle was delicious, and I made a hearty supper of part of it and some\r\nof the boiled meat. With the photographic apparatus were two chemist’s\r\ngraduated glasses, one of eight and one of four ounces. These made\r\ncapital drinking-cups. The larger one I used for that purpose, and into\r\nthe smaller put the precious, hard-earned salt.\r\n\r\nAs I had no notion to go to bed with the sun, I cast about for something\r\nto occupy the two or three hours before bedtime, and concluded to fry\r\nup a store of turtle meat in my trays. By nine o’clock I had thus\r\nprepared fully twenty pounds of the meat, which I piled upon a pavement\r\nof clam-shells in one corner of the house. The land crabs being duly\r\nfenced out, I turned in and slept soundly all night.\r\n\r\nIn the morning I was up at break of day, and ate a breakfast of hot\r\nsoup. Immediately after breakfast I began to thatch my roof. For this\r\npurpose I carefully cut bundles of the long, dry grass, and beginning at\r\nthe eaves, laid a row, butts down, in a layer about three inches in\r\nthickness. On this, near the tops of the grass, I tied a stalk of the\r\nhibiscus; then another layer of grass, covering the first down two\r\nthirds of its length and covering also the hibiscus stalk; and so on,\r\nlayer after layer, on both pitches of the roof, until the ridgepole was\r\nreached. At the comb of the ridge I finished all by bending down the\r\ngrass at each side and securing it with a couple of the stalks, one at\r\neach side. I then heaped up the sand around the bottom of the walls on\r\nthe outside, to give greater stability to the structure, and dug a ditch\r\nto prevent the water from flooding the interior if it should come down\r\nfaster than the sandy soil could absorb it.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to make was some sort of door, and the planning and\r\nfashioning of this gave me occasion for no little thought and trouble.\r\nFinally, after trying other methods unsuccessfully, I rigged up a sort\r\nof rolling blind out of the stalks by cutting a number of them of a\r\nlength a little greater than the width of the doorway and tying them\r\nclose together by a cord at each end and one in the middle, so that the\r\nwhole would be flexible like a curtain. This I hung over the doorway and\r\nattached a loop at each lower corner to secure it when it was down. When\r\nthe door was to be opened this curtain could be rolled up and held in\r\nposition by pulling a cord, or could be swung aside when ingress or\r\negress merely was desired. Along the walls inside I made some rude\r\nshelves of hibiscus stalks, so that I might have my small possessions\r\nhandy and safe.\r\n\r\nI intended as soon as convenient to spin a good supply of cord and make\r\na hammock to swing from one of the palm pillars to the other. In the\r\nmean time, as a temporary expedient for a bed, I laid a platform of\r\nhibiscus stalks in one corner, and covered them with a thick layer of\r\ngrass. For ventilation and light, I cut under the projecting eaves four\r\nopenings, or windows, into which, so sheltered, the rain would not be\r\nlikely to drive. The chest answered for a seat or table as occasion\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nHere was a reasonably comfortable dwelling where I should be safe from\r\nthe rain. And, indeed, it was completed none too soon, for even as I was\r\nsitting in the house on the chest, resting and contemplating my work, I\r\nheard the wind rustling among the palm leaves and was sensible of a\r\ndarkening of the sky, which betokened a storm. The swaying of the two\r\nyoung palms which held the ridgepole at once warned me that the motion\r\nwas likely to rack and weaken the whole structure. The tops of these two\r\ntrees must come off at once. By hauling out the chest and using it as a\r\nscaffolding, I could reach the palm trunks at a point above the\r\nridgepole; but when I tried to cut the tree with my knife, I found it\r\nwould take too long to sever it. Therefore, the only way was to climb\r\nthe slender trunk and break off its branches. One of the trunks bent so\r\nunder my weight as to break short off above the ridgepole, dropping me\r\non the sand, but without harm. The other one I succeeded in denuding of\r\nits crown of leaves.\r\n\r\nThe storm was coming up grandly from the southeast. The sea in that\r\ndirection was of an indigo tint streaked with flashes of foam, and above\r\nhung a leaden mass of clouds with a touch of copper-color here and\r\nthere, where the internal fires flashed and glowed. The wind sank to a\r\nperfect calm, and occasionally a great drop of rain fell warm as blood.\r\nI had brought all the contents of the chest up near the hut, and I now\r\nhurried to get them under the shelter. The fire was smouldering near by,\r\nand there was a good supply of wood piled near it. I hurriedly carried\r\nthis into the house, and also four or five charred and ignited sticks,\r\nwhich I placed in the middle of the room on the sand together in such\r\nmanner that they would smoulder slowly there and keep alight. The smoke\r\nmight be an annoyance, but as soon as there was a draught of air, it\r\nwould drift out through the ventilators, and I could keep to windward of\r\nit. Finally I ran out and dragged in my turtle shell with its store of\r\nmeat, and put that also under shelter.\r\n\r\nThe calm still continued deathlike and dark. When all was under shelter\r\nand I had returned from the brook with my goblet filled with fresh\r\nwater, I stood at the open door, looking at the sea. Suddenly, without\r\nany further warning, down came the rain in bucketfuls, falling in\r\nvertical lines,--such a shower as is rarely seen. The roof held tight,\r\nthe water streaming from it like a cataract, but not a drop coming\r\nthrough to the interior. In about twenty minutes the rain as suddenly\r\nceased. Looking out over the ocean, I saw on the surface a streak of\r\nblue-black water, parallel with the horizon and flecked with tiny\r\nstreaks of white, advancing. The squall was coming. Hurriedly I unrolled\r\nmy door-curtain and fastened it securely at the bottom. I was just in\r\ntime. As the blast struck the house, the whole structure trembled and\r\nswayed, but held fast. I could hear the shrieking of the wind as it\r\nswept through the neighboring palms, and the occasional crash of a\r\nbreaking stem mingled with the dashing rain which now drove violently\r\nagainst the roof and walls, and I thanked my good-fortune that this\r\nshelter was ready. This gale continued to blow until long after dark.\r\nIndeed it was still raging when I fell asleep, to dream of shipwrecks\r\nand hurricanes.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke early in the morning and looked out through the ventilator,\r\nI found that the wind had fallen to a moderate breeze and had veered\r\naround to the northeast, bringing a dense fog, and that a fine rain was\r\nfalling with a settled appearance such as betokened a wet day. My first\r\ncare was to look after my fire. It was almost out, and to rekindle it\r\nfrom the few smouldering sparks was a matter requiring very tender\r\nmanipulation. But at last I had it going again, and my pans of turtle\r\nmeat stewing and frying on a gentle blaze, that demanded to be watched\r\nconstantly.\r\n\r\nThis was a good time to overhaul my stock of books to see what they\r\nwere, and to find out whether the salt water had left them in condition\r\nfor use. They were now perfectly dry, but the bindings were warped and\r\nloosened. The leaves were in many places stuck together, and yellow and\r\nbrown leather stains had crept in about the margins. But they still held\r\ntogether and were legible. The books consisted of a dozen well-selected\r\nnovels, a manual of photography, the United States Dispensatory, a\r\nstudent’s manual of botany, a school geology, and a German word-book.\r\nLooking over these books while I lay on my couch, with an occasional\r\nglance at the cooking, I passed the time very pleasantly all the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nAt noon the rain still continued; so, not to be idle, I ran out and\r\npicked up some freshly fallen cocoanuts both to vary my diet and to\r\nobtain a supply of fibre for spinning. The whole afternoon was spent in\r\npreparing the fibre and spinning it into cord, and by night I had\r\naccumulated quite enough to make me a hammock. This, I resolved, should\r\nbe my next task if the foul weather continued. The smoke from the\r\nsmouldering fire was a source of great annoyance, by getting into my\r\neyes. I determined to remedy this as soon as I could, by erecting a\r\nfireplace and chimney of some sort. But in the mean time I utilized this\r\nannoying guest as much as possible by hanging several sticks full of\r\nstrips of the turtle meat in the peak of the roof, where the smoke\r\ncollected thickest, that it might become partially cured. This, I hoped,\r\nwould preserve it, as it had been lying in sea water in the shell; and\r\nso it proved. For after this smoking the meat dried without taint, and,\r\nas I subsequently found, made most excellent eating.\r\n\r\nWith melted turtle fat, a clam-shell, and a wick made of fibre, I\r\nimprovised a light, and after it grew dark, fell to looking over my\r\nlibrary until bedtime, the rain still pattering on the thatch when I\r\nretired. The next morning the weather was still boisterous, the rain\r\ndriving and the heavy mists sweeping along the sea. The leaden clouds\r\nstill hung low and dark. This day I spent indoors working at my hammock\r\nand varying the monotony by hanging up the last of the meat to smoke,\r\nlooking over my books and wishing for fair weather. I finished the\r\nhammock, but could not use it on account of the smoke, and was obliged\r\nto sleep on my pallet as before. As the turtle fat was all gone and\r\ntherefore no light was to be had, I turned in early and awoke in the\r\nmorning at dawn. On going out I found the sky clear and the sun rising\r\nfair. All the foliage looked fresh and bright after the rain, and the\r\nbirds were cheerfully singing in the forest. It was a glorious change,\r\nand my confinement in the house for two days gave added zest to it. This\r\nwould be a good day for an exploring trip, and I thought I would spend\r\nit in such an expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPIG-HUNTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the photographic appliances there was a sort of haversack or bag\r\nwith a shoulder-strap, designed to contain plate-holders. This I emptied\r\nand stored with a supply of fried turtle meat and a small bottle of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAbout seven o’clock I started up the bed of the brook, as affording the\r\neasiest path by which to penetrate the forest that, coming down nearly\r\nto the beach, extended on each hand as far as I could see. To the south\r\nwas a stretch of low land, perhaps twenty acres in extent, covered for\r\nthe most part with grass, and in the lowest portion with reeds and\r\nrushes. Just as the brook emerged from the forest it was shadowed by a\r\ndense mass of tall canes. The grass I had used in the construction of my\r\nhouse was a coarse variety growing from two and a half to three feet in\r\nheight. On the higher ground grew a slenderer variety with heavy seed\r\nheads, a sample of which I gathered as it seemed to resemble canary\r\nseed, and might serve as food. Great quantities of this grass grew\r\nthickly on the knolls and higher parts of the upland. The water deepened\r\nwhere I waded through the canebrake, and ran with a sluggish current. I\r\ngathered a great bundle of rushes, and laid them on the bank, intending\r\nto pick them up on my return. They would be useful in weaving me a\r\nsubstitute for a hat, a convenience which I lacked at that time.\r\n\r\nJust at the farther border of the canebrake, there was a muddy place\r\nwhere pigs had evidently been wallowing, for I found thousands of\r\ntracks about. Here was a favorite resort for them, not above a quarter\r\nof a mile from my house; but I wasted no time then hunting for this\r\ngame, as I had formed no plan for its capture.\r\n\r\nOne thing I wanted to find was a bed of clay, which could be put to many\r\nvaluable uses, especially the building of a fireplace and chimney. There\r\nwas reason to believe that plenty was to be had on the island, which was\r\nof volcanic formation, and moreover the water of the brook, swollen by\r\nthe recent rain, was stained as though with clay.\r\n\r\nAs I neared the line of cliff and rocks that formed the central ridge or\r\nback-bone of the island, the course of the stream bent to the north, and\r\nthe forest was interspersed with small open glades where the great\r\nbutterflies floated across through the sunshine, the metallic satiny\r\nblue of their lustrous wings glancing in the light. A flock of parrots\r\nwith green, red, and blue plumage were chattering and screaming noisily\r\nin the bordering trees, and an occasional little green lizard would dash\r\nalong the fallen trunks or over the rocks like a flash of emerald light.\r\nIn one of these glades I found a quantity of shrubs growing about ten\r\nfeet high and loaded with berries about the size of pepper-corns. The\r\noutside of these berries seemed covered with a greenish white wax. The\r\nleaf was somewhat like the myrtle. A sample of this, and of several\r\nother varieties of vegetation which were strange to me, I gathered to\r\ntake home for identification in my manual of botany. I may here state\r\nthat this berry-bearing shrub turned out to be the wax myrtle (_Myrica\r\ncerifera_ of the botanists), and that the waxy coating of the berries\r\nwas what is known as bay-berry tallow. This wax can be readily collected\r\nby boiling the drupes and skimming it off as it rises to the surface of\r\nthe water; and a bushel of the berries will yield from four to five\r\npounds of the wax, which can be employed to make excellent candles.\r\n\r\nNear the cliffs I came upon a fine bed of clay, and I was so delighted\r\nwith this discovery that I immediately began casting about for means of\r\ntransporting a good supply to my house. The bed was distant from the\r\nhouse, as nearly as I could judge, about two miles, and the labor of\r\ncarrying such heavy material would be very great. The best plan would be\r\nto knock together a raft of dry wood and float the clay down stream as a\r\ncargo. Vines and creepers to serve as cordage to tie the dead wood\r\ntogether were abundant, nor did it take me long to collect the wood and\r\nfashion the raft. Indeed, the harder task proved to be the digging out\r\nof the tough clay, as the only implements I had for this purpose were\r\npointed sticks. But I finally cut a sharp, heavy stake of hard wood, and\r\nby driving this into the clay, was able to pry off large chunks, and\r\nsoon had a load ready. On the raft I laid some broad leaves and pieces\r\nof bark to serve as a deck, and on this placed the clay in a great heap,\r\nas much as the raft would carry in the shallow water. Tying a long\r\ncreeper to the raft, by which to pull, guide, or hold it back, as the\r\nnavigation might require, I started it off into the current, and wading\r\nin the shallow stream, followed it down, holding on to the line as it\r\nfloated away. Barring an occasional grounding in the shallow places, my\r\nraft floated serenely along at a good pace, and soon reached port, where\r\nI unloaded the clay and drew out the raft to serve as firewood.\r\n\r\nThis was a good job well done, and I more than once regretted the time I\r\nhad wasted in the lime-burning task, for had I found this clay sooner, a\r\nmuch better salt pan could have been made with it than with the mortar.\r\nThis thought caused me to go and examine the salt pan. I found the\r\nmortar on the bottom dry and hard, so I opened the gate that the sea\r\nwater might flow in at the next tide and fill it.\r\n\r\nThe first use to be made of the clay was in the building of a fireplace\r\nand chimney for the house. My plan was to build up the structure of\r\nsticks, cob-house fashion, and then chink and plaster it with a good\r\ncoating of clay. Before this could be done, however, it would be\r\nnecessary to put the clay through some pugging process by which it could\r\nbe rendered soft and plastic. This I accomplished by trampling the clay\r\nwith my naked feet, adding a sprinkling of water now and then, until I\r\nhad a mass of soft, mortar-like consistency. Then on the outside of the\r\nhouse I built up the fireplace close against the wall, and carried the\r\nchimney up about a foot above the highest part of the roof, plastering\r\nthe sticks inside thoroughly with the soft clay. When this was done I\r\ncut through the wall to the fireplace, and plastered clay on the jambs\r\nto make all tight. The hearth I formed of harder clay, well pounded down\r\nand mixed with the sand. If no wind came until the structure was dry, it\r\nwould become hard and strong enough to resist anything short of a\r\nhurricane. That the drying might be more rapid, I immediately built a\r\ngood fire in it, and was rejoiced to find the draught excellent and the\r\neffect of the bright firelight upon the interior quite pleasant and\r\nhomelike. This work occupied the whole day.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I brought a good supply of clay into the house, and using\r\nthe chest as a work-bench, busied myself until bedtime with moulding\r\nseveral vessels of different shapes and sizes for use in cooking and\r\nabout the house. I fashioned a rude pot capable of holding about five\r\ngallons; a smaller one to hold a gallon or thereabouts; a water-jar with\r\ntwo handles by which it might be swung with a cord from the ridgepole,\r\nto contain drinking-water; and others of various shapes and sizes. All\r\nthese I dusted over inside and out with dry sand and set aside where\r\nthey might dry ready for burning.\r\n\r\nThat night I slept for the first time in my hammock, and the change was\r\na comfortable one, though in the early morning hours I felt the need of\r\nsome warm covering. For however hot the days might be, the nights on the\r\nisland were always cool. However, when it got chilly I turned out and\r\nheaped the dry grass of my former bed into the hammock, and was soon\r\nwarm enough.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, after setting my vessels out in the sun, I turned to the\r\ncareful examination of all the samples of vegetation which I had\r\ncollected, carefully looking them up in the Botany to find their names\r\nand properties, and also in the Dispensatory. The seed-bearing grass was\r\nundoubtedly canary grass. Besides this and the wax-bearing myrtle, the\r\nonly other notable sample was a species of india-rubber-bearing\r\nartocarpus. As the canary grass was ripe, I thought I could not do\r\nbetter than to harvest a good supply of it at once. The whole of that\r\nday and the next were spent in gathering it and stacking it up near the\r\nhouse. The labor was very great, as my knife was a poor substitute for a\r\nsickle; but the necessity of some sort of farinaceous food spurred me\r\non. I gathered in all a great stack ten feet in diameter and twelve feet\r\nhigh at the peak. This I thatched with grass, just as I had seen grain\r\nstacks thatched at home, that it might be protected from the wet. Great\r\nflocks of small birds were feeding upon this seed where it grew, and I\r\ntrapped a dozen or more by unhinging the chest lid and using it propped\r\nup with a stick as a trap.\r\n\r\nTo try the character of the seed as food, I parched a pint of it over\r\nthe fire and then crushed it in a great bivalve shell with a round stone\r\ninto a coarse meal. This meal I mixed with water and salt, and it made a\r\nvery good sort of cold gruel. This, with the birds broiled on the coals,\r\nmade quite the best meal I had so far eaten on the island. The salt pan\r\nhad already begun to yield salt, which was crystallizing along the edges\r\nas the water evaporated. The smoked turtle meat continued good, and I\r\nrelished it very much. The weather remained fine from day to day, and I\r\nhad strong hopes that a vessel might heave in sight at any moment. As a\r\npreparation for such a chance I laid a pile of wood ready to make a\r\nsignal fire, and as a permanent signal selected an isolated palm-tree\r\nand denuding it of its leaves, tied a great stick across it near the\r\ntop,--an arrangement which, I hoped, might attract the attention of a\r\npassing vessel should I fail to see it. Of material to make a flag I had\r\nnothing to spare except the square of black focussing-cloth belonging to\r\nthe camera,--and this I needed every night as a covering, as it was all\r\nI had for that purpose.\r\n\r\nAs soon as my pots and other vessels were thoroughly dry I built a great\r\npile of dry wood over them and set fire to it. I greatly feared some of\r\nthem might crack with the heat, but fortunately they all came out in a\r\nserviceable condition though by no means very hard. Now that I had a\r\nlarge vessel in which water could be boiled, I bethought me of the wax\r\nberries and made several trips to gather a store of them. These I boiled\r\nin my large pot, and skimmed off the wax until I had collected fully\r\nforty pounds of it, the product of about ten bushels of the berries. Of\r\nthis wax I made candles, or rather rushlights, by dipping dry rushes\r\ninto the melted wax and letting it cool on them. When one coat of wax\r\nset I would dip the rush again, and so on, until each rush had four\r\ngood coats. One of these candles would burn about four hours and give a\r\ngood steady light without sputtering or guttering, though the rush wick\r\nrequired occasional snuffing. These lights were a great comfort to me at\r\nnight, for I could read and do light work until bedtime without the\r\nnecessity of keeping up a hot fire.\r\n\r\nIt was by candle-light that I made me a hat out of rushes as follows:\r\nSelecting about fifty of the cleanest and slenderest I could find, and\r\nall of about equal length, I tied them firmly together by a cord wound\r\ntightly around near the butts. Then I interwove stalks of the tough,\r\nheavy grass, spreading the rushes out into a conical shape until large\r\nenough to fit comfortably on my head. This was the body of the hat. The\r\nbrim was produced in the same manner by bending out the ends of the\r\nrushes to a common horizontal plane and then interweaving the grass as\r\nbefore, finishing the edge of the brim with a grass selvage. This made a\r\nlight, cool structure, sufficient to keep the sun off my head, and far\r\nmore comfortable than the handkerchief I had worn wound about it as my\r\nsole head-covering up to this time.\r\n\r\nNow that the salt pan was doing its work, and a supply of salt within a\r\nfew days was considerably more than a mere possibility, I felt justified\r\nin endeavoring to obtain a store of meat. My mind turned to the turtle\r\nand the pigs, especially the latter; for if I could by any means capture\r\na pig, there would be several weeks’ rations, at least, of fresh,\r\nsalted, and smoked pork. Visions of broiled ham and bacon troubled my\r\ndreams. I made an effort to capture another turtle, watching the beach\r\nfor the good part of a night; but I saw none. The next morning, I\r\ndetermined to go upon a regularly organized pig-hunt. The only method of\r\ncapturing them was by means of a lasso or the bolas. The forty-foot\r\nline that came ashore around the chest would make an excellent lasso,\r\nand I rigged it at once with a slip noose. I also cut a hard-wood pole\r\nabout eight feet in length, charred the end in the fire to harden it,\r\nand made it sharp for use as a lance. A bolas was contrived out of two\r\nstones tied, one at each end, to a stout cord six feet long. Thus\r\naccoutred, I struck off from the creek and made a détour through the\r\ndense jungle so as to force the game into the stream, or at least to be\r\nupon higher ground if they should prove to be in the mud, as I hoped\r\nwould be the case. The labor of penetrating the dense scrub was very\r\ngreat, and the heat intense; not a breath of air could reach these\r\nfastnesses, and perspiration poured from me as though I were in a\r\nTurkish bath.\r\n\r\nAfter a two-hours struggle I found myself nearing the place, and it\r\nbecame necessary to move with the greatest caution. Every few minutes I\r\nwould stop and listen. Presently I could hear the murmur of the brook,\r\nand crawling along cautiously, I came to a fallen tree, the trunk of\r\nwhich reached quite to the stream. By following this down carefully, I\r\ncame to a point where I could see the wallowing-place. There, sure\r\nenough, were the pigs, a score or more in number, mostly lying asleep\r\nand half buried in the mud. I studied the whole situation rapidly but\r\nthoroughly. It seemed probable from the lay of the ground that if\r\nsomething could frighten the animals from the other side, they would\r\nnaturally rush under the fallen tree just below me. Indeed, there was a\r\nwell-beaten track at this place going under the trunk, which was at this\r\npoint about five feet from the ground, and the stream, the canebrake,\r\nand the dense jungle made this by far the easiest route for the pigs.\r\n\r\nMy plan was made instantly, thus: I would throw the bolas at a\r\nhalf-grown pig that was rooting about near the jungle on the farther\r\nside of the group, and take my chance of the herd coming this way when\r\nthey broke. I unrolled my lasso and laid it ready for instant use,\r\nplaced my lance where it could be grasped, and cautiously rising, that I\r\nmight have free play, swung the bolas around twice and let it fly.\r\nGyrating like twin planets, the stones sped fairly through the air, true\r\nto the mark; one passed under the pig, and the other swung behind him,\r\nwrapping the cords around the hind-quarters and legs, and bowling him\r\nover like a ten-pin. The little fellow set up a squeal, and then, whoof!\r\nwhoof! with a grunt and a squeal, the whole herd sprang up, looked\r\naround, saw their overturned and struggling companion, and started\r\ndirectly toward my place of concealment. In the mean time I had crouched\r\ndown out of view, and spread my noose ready for business. Underneath\r\nthey ran squealing and snorting in great panic, and I let them pass as I\r\nhad my eye on a great boar who was very deliberate in his movements and\r\nappeared to disdain undignified flight. He slowly advanced, however,\r\nchamping his tusks until they frothed, and shaking his great head. I\r\nthought it best, in view of his great size and weight, to take a turn of\r\nthe lasso around a limb and give it a hitch as a holdfast, as my own\r\nstrength would not be enough to stop the brute. I had scarcely done this\r\nwhen his head came under the tree, and I swung the noose deftly over it\r\nas he emerged, and then hauled in the slack. The astonished beast sprang\r\nforward with a great bound and jerked the rope from my hands with such\r\nviolence that I was thrown to the ground.\r\n\r\nWhen I scrambled up I saw the rope tighten until it sung in the air like\r\na bowstring, and then slacken again. I could not see the boar, as he was\r\nhidden in the long grass; but I seized my sharpened stick lance and ran\r\ntoward where he ought to be. Suddenly the great brute emerged from the\r\ngrass, facing me, and charged toward me, evidently bent on mischief, the\r\nflakes of froth flying from his tusks. There was no time to get out of\r\nthe way, nor even get the lance around into position, and I thought I\r\nshould speedily feel his sharp tusks. He was almost upon me before I\r\ncould realize the situation. Just at this critical juncture I felt the\r\nlasso fly up under my feet, throwing me over backward, and I caught a\r\nglimpse of the boar as he turned a half-somersault and plunged down on\r\nhis side. When he fell he was not two feet from me. The lasso had been\r\ndoubled around a bush and had thus brought the desperate creature up\r\njust in time to save me. The lance was still in my grasp, and I got to\r\nmy feet before my enemy could recover. Now it was my turn. Knowing he\r\ncould not reach me on this side, I came close up to him as he was making\r\nthe dirt fly with his legs in a vain endeavor to get up, and drove the\r\nsharpened stick with all my force and weight into his side, just back of\r\nthe shoulder.\r\n\r\nThis ended the battle as the stick went half-way through him. Panting\r\nfor breath and with the perspiration fairly running into my eyes, I\r\nturned away and left him to die in peace, and went to look after the\r\npig, thinking I had been a great fool to tackle the boar at all. I found\r\nthe pig still struggling with the bolas wrapped around him. I\r\nimmediately determined to keep this one alive. To do this, I must get my\r\nlasso loose from the dying boar. When I went back I found him just\r\nkicking his last. With the lasso I secured the pig in such manner that\r\nhe could not get away, and then removed the bolas and let him up, giving\r\nhim very little rope as I had no mind to let him run into the brush and\r\nentangle himself. I then proceeded to flay the boar, cutting off the\r\nhams and choicer parts, and securing as much of the lard and fat as I\r\nwas able. I carried this down the bed of the creek to the house. I then\r\nwent back for the pig and endeavored to get him home alive; but I found\r\nit utterly impossible to do so, as the vicious, obstinate brute could\r\nnot be made to go in any but the wrong direction. So I was finally\r\nobliged to haul him tight up against a tree and kill him.\r\n\r\nI now had a great store of pork, and the next thing was to cure it. Salt\r\nwas now the important thing, and I went to my salt pan to see what the\r\nprospect was. To my great satisfaction, I found the water all dried up,\r\nleaving a fine layer of glistening salt, thickest in the lower part of\r\nthe basin and gradually thinning away to a mere frosting at the edges.\r\nIt was quite dry and caked, so that there was no trouble to get it up\r\nfrom the bottom, and when I had heaped it together in the centre, there\r\nwere, I should judge, over fifty pounds. This precious commodity I\r\ncarried at once to the house so that it might be under shelter from the\r\ndew and rain.\r\n\r\nI turned to at once to “dry-salt” the pork, rubbing each piece\r\nthoroughly on all sides, and piling the whole up in the now empty turtle\r\nshell with the breast plate weighed down on it with heavy stones. The\r\nonly place where I could store this meat was in the single room of my\r\nhouse. But I determined to remedy this by building as soon as possible a\r\nlean-to at the back of the house, which I could use first as a\r\nsmoke-house, and then as a storeroom for my provisions. The turtle meat,\r\nnow perfectly cured, I stored temporarily in the chest.\r\n\r\nThat night I lay in my hammock in position to see the starlit ocean\r\nthrough one of the ventilators, and thought over my situation. I could\r\nnot now complain of lack of food, for there was a supply sufficient to\r\nlast me two months at least, and there was reason to suppose that it\r\nwould not be at all difficult to replenish the store. In my porous\r\nearthen jar, slung at the head of my hammock in the cool air-current,\r\nand by its slow evaporation cooling the liquid contents, was pure, cool,\r\nsweet water to drink, and outside was a running brook from which to fill\r\nit as often as required. I could safely hope to support myself here as\r\nlong as might be necessary. But as I had no desire to remain\r\nindefinitely a prisoner on this island, I began to turn my thoughts\r\npersistently upon the problem of building a boat to get away in. If in\r\nthe mean time a vessel of some sort should heave in sight I was prepared\r\nto take advantage of the chance; and if none came I would still have my\r\nwork started and no time unnecessarily lost.\r\n\r\nBefore I went to sleep that night I had planned a method of building a\r\nboat which I thought would be within the possibility of accomplishment,\r\nand had determined to begin work on the morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nBOAT-BUILDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I roused the next morning the first thought that came to me was\r\nabout the building of the boat. It would be necessary to have a shed to\r\nwork under, large enough to contain a boat, both for shelter from the\r\nrain and for shade from the pitiless tropical sun. The building of such\r\na shed was therefore the first task. As a suitable shipyard I selected\r\nthe side of the stream on the sands of the sea-beach, and far enough\r\nabove tide to be safe from a possible storm. Here I put up eight posts\r\nin the sand. To get these posts (for they had to be hunted for among the\r\nfallen wood), to carry them one or two at a time for a distance ranging\r\nfrom half a mile to a mile and a half, and to set them up in holes dug\r\nat the proper distances apart, was a whole day’s work, and left me only\r\ntime to overhaul my dry-salting before bed-time. I went over each piece\r\nof meat, rubbing it again with salt, and turning it the other side up,\r\nand finished by putting the weights on again as before. This salting and\r\nturning every day would be necessary for about two weeks, and then the\r\nmeat would be ready for the smoke-house, which I would endeavor in the\r\nmeantime to get ready to receive it.\r\n\r\nThe next day I spent getting poles for rafters, and lashing them\r\ntogether to form the roof of my workshop. Then a rain storm set in and\r\nlasted three days, during which I was practically confined to the house,\r\nand busied myself indoors with making an easy chair out of a dry stick\r\nof cedar that split readily into straight pieces. It was a pleasure to\r\nwork in this soft, straight-grained, fragrant wood, and I made a good,\r\nstrong, comfortable arm-chair, dowelling and cording the parts together,\r\nand framing a sort of base for it so that it would stand firm on the\r\nsand floor. I could now sit and read with comfort, or look at the gray,\r\nrainy sea as it stretched its misty plane away before my door. It was at\r\nthis time that I began to keep an irregular sort of journal, entering my\r\nthoughts and doings from time to time as the enforced semi-idleness of\r\nrainy weather prompted me. Besides pencils and pens there was paper\r\nenough in my stock, wet and stained and wrinkled though it had been, to\r\nlast me indefinitely.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the rain was over I took the first day to construct my\r\nprovision and smoke-house, in order that I might store the meat in it. A\r\ndoorway was cut from my living-room into this store-room, and I purposed\r\nfitting a tight door into it before smoking my pork. I busied myself\r\nafter that on my work-shed until it was finished. This roof I covered\r\nwith palm-leaves,--not leaves of the cocoanut-palm, but of the great,\r\nspreading fan-palm, a single one of which was often three or four feet\r\nin diameter. I had used these leaves in making my storehouse roof, and\r\nhad secured a giant specimen in a horizontal position over my front door\r\nas a sort of porch, and to keep the sun out of the house when the door\r\nwas open.\r\n\r\nThe work-shed when finished was about twenty-four feet long by ten feet\r\nwide, with a shed or single-pitch roof, at the upper side about eight\r\nfeet, and at the lower side--which was toward the sea--about five feet\r\nfrom the ground. Underneath was the clean sand of the beach. I was now\r\nready to begin the actual work of boat-building, and my first need was\r\na supply of clay,--so great a quantity, in fact, as would take me\r\nseveral days of hard work to raft down the stream to the boat-shed.\r\n\r\nYou will see as I proceed what part this material was to play. After a\r\ngreat deal of labor, wading up and down the creek, digging, loading,\r\nrafting, and unloading, I at last accumulated a sufficient amount for my\r\npurpose in a great heap close to the boat-shed. I next proceeded to\r\nsmooth the sand beneath the shed, and to compact it into a smooth, hard\r\nfloor as follows: I took of perfectly dry clay several bushels in\r\nfragments, and crushed these to a fine dust; this dust I sprinkled\r\nevenly all over the sand floor to the depth of an inch or more,\r\nsprinkling and wetting the dust and the sand liberally with a bough\r\ndipped in the sea water. As the mixture grew dry I trampled it with my\r\nnaked feet until it was smooth and firm, sprinkling a little dry sand on\r\nthe surface and trampling it in. The result was a dustless, dry floor,\r\nhard enough to support my weight readily, and smooth enough for my\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nOn this floor, with a stretched cord rubbed with charcoal, I marked, as\r\ncarpenters do with a chalk line, a straight line twenty-one feet long or\r\nthereabouts; this was to be the length of the boat, and its centre line\r\nfrom stem to stern. Using the cord as a measure, I laid off at each side\r\nof this centre line, the horizontal outline of my proposed boat. The\r\ngreatest breadth of beam I made about six feet, and tapered both the\r\nstem and the stern alike, after the manner of a whaleboat. At each end\r\nof the centre line I drove a stake upright, and notched the top to carry\r\na guide line stretched from one to the other directly over the centre\r\nline. Then, with tempered clay, I marked the outline of the boat by\r\nbuilding up a little wall about three inches in breadth and as many in\r\nheight all around from stem to stern on both sides. The space inside\r\nthis wall I filled with sand, sprinkled and compacted until it was level\r\nwith the top of the wall. Then I added to the wall another course of\r\nclay and filled in again; and so kept on adding and filling and sloping\r\nin the wall, until I had a mound of clay-coated sand, shaped like a boat\r\nturned upside down.\r\n\r\nThis labor, simple as it sounds in statement, took me over a week, and\r\nbefore it was done I was interrupted by the necessity for setting my\r\nsmoke-house in order for curing the hams and bacon. I built for the\r\nsmoking a slow fire of bark, which required attention only once or twice\r\neach day. The clay form under the boat-shed I left to get dry and hard.\r\nIt was my design, as I have no doubt you have already guessed, to use\r\nthis clay form as a core or groundwork, upon which to shape my boat.\r\n\r\nThe next step was a most serious task; I had to procure a piece of\r\ntimber for a keel, and shape it and fit to it two pieces, one at the\r\nstem, and one at the stern. The timber must be new and strong. There was\r\nabsolutely no way to get this timber except by felling a tree which must\r\nbe at least a foot in diameter. I could not hope to do this with a\r\npocket knife except by an appalling amount of labor, and at the\r\ncontinual risk of breaking the blade; and, moreover, I did not want to\r\nsubject this valuable instrument to any more wear than was absolutely\r\nnecessary. I now carried it on my person tied securely to a lanyard as\r\nmy most highly prized possession. But I thought I could manage to get\r\ndown a tree by the aid of fire. Having selected the tree, I plastered\r\nthe trunk with wet clay all around for a height of five or six feet,\r\nexcepting a space of about two feet next the ground; then piled up dry\r\nfuel on the windward side and set fire to it. After an hour or two the\r\ntrunk caught fire and slowly burned. I kept checking the fire from\r\neating upward by dabbing wet clay on, until finally the tree burned\r\nthrough and fell. It was a much less difficult task to burn it in two at\r\nthe proper length after it was once down.\r\n\r\nThis done, the next thing was to reduce the stick to the correct lateral\r\ndimensions, which should be ten inches by three or thereabouts. As there\r\nwas no saw, adze, or axe to be had, this reduction could be done in no\r\nother way so easily as by splitting the trunk with hard-wood wedges. I\r\nmade several and charred them in the fire, then sharpened them and drove\r\nfour of them in a line into the wood of the trunk at equal distances\r\napart. By judicious management, driving them little by little, one after\r\nanother, the trunk was riven asunder, and a second split produced a\r\npiece of the right size when a little had been split off from each edge.\r\nThe plank was not as smooth as if turned out by a saw mill; but it was\r\nstrong and was smooth enough for my purpose. I dragged it down to the\r\nboat-shed, and went back to the log and split off in like manner a piece\r\nof suitable size to make the stem and stern posts. I set the keel timber\r\nup on edge on the clay mould, securing it temporarily with some lumps of\r\nclay until I could mark the correct length. The stem and stern posts I\r\ncut and halved on to the keel, pinning them on by pins.\r\n\r\nThe drill by means of which I bored the holes for the pins was fashioned\r\nby inserting a piece of sharp chalcedony splinter into a split stick and\r\nsecurely wrapping the stick with a piece of cord. This stick or shank,\r\nwhich was about two feet in length, carried a ball of dry clay of three\r\nor more pounds in weight, and mounted about six inches from the\r\nchalcedony point. Through the upper end of the shank was a hole passing\r\nthrough which was a cord secured at each end to a loose cross-stick\r\nabout a foot long. By twisting this cord around the shank the movement\r\nup and down of the loose cross-stick would cause the drill to revolve\r\nfirst in one direction and then in the other, the momentum of the\r\nwhirling ball of clay causing the apparatus to continue its motion far\r\nenough to rewind the cord. This device is much used by primitive\r\npeoples, and it certainly proved a most effective instrument to me; for\r\nwithout renewing the drill point I bored five holes at each end, through\r\nthe keel piece and the uprights.\r\n\r\nThe gunwale I made by splitting cane into long, thin strips half an inch\r\nin width, and laying these in a bundle tied securely round every three\r\nor four inches with a wrapping of cord. By this means I produced a sort\r\nof stiff, untwisted cable. I secured the ends of these gunwale cables\r\nfirmly to the stem and stern uprights by cord passed through holes. I\r\nnext got a great store of a sort of long, slender-stemmed creeper, which\r\nI fancy must have been a species of climbing palm, though I am not sure;\r\nfor there was no description of it in my books. The wood of this creeper\r\nwas tough and exceedingly fibrous. Of it I proposed to make the ribs of\r\nthe boat, setting them about three inches apart along the whole length\r\nof the boat. The creepers which I chose for this purpose were about half\r\nan inch in diameter, and smooth and uniform in size. Holes drilled\r\nthrough the keel piece close to the clay mould permitted the passage of\r\nthese ribs over the mould from gunwale to gunwale, where they were\r\nfastened by being inserted in the mass of cane splints and securely tied\r\nthere with several wrappings of cöir. Of course I had to stop this work\r\nfrom time to time to manufacture the necessary supply of cöir.\r\n\r\nSuch interruptions were a relief to me, and I would sit in the shade of\r\nthe palms spinning away and thinking of my Mohawk Valley home, or gazing\r\nout upon the broad sea, where the perfect shading from deep blue to\r\nfaint cobalt and fainter green, the long swell, and the transparent,\r\ncurling breakers, the restless sea fowl, and the serene, cloud-flecked\r\nsky, formed a view of which I never tired. It is a mistake, it seems to\r\nme, to speak of the sea as a lonesome thing. Its ceaseless motion, its\r\nconstant change of color and of mood, never exactly alike and yet never\r\nentirely unlike, all lend to it an indefinable charm. It may, indeed, be\r\nfilled with solitude, but it also is filled with companionship for the\r\nsolitary, as I learned then to realize.\r\n\r\nThe island was the home of an astonishing number of species of small\r\nbirds; several different varieties of the parrot family flew from tree\r\nto tree in flocks; different kinds of finches, many of bright plumage,\r\nin great numbers haunted the bushes about the stream; larks,\r\nflycatchers, gorgeous scarlet tanagers, little wrens, and tiny\r\nhumming-birds were very numerous. The bird that I took most interest in\r\nwas a daring little fellow, perhaps some sort of wren, of a brownish\r\ncolor, specked with pearly white spots. This self-contained and\r\nself-satisfied little fowl had a habit of carrying his tail stuck\r\nstraight up in the air and cocking his head to one side in a most\r\ncomical manner. This species seemed quite fearless of me, and I often\r\nsaw them come hopping up on the ground near to where I sat, as though\r\nbent on ascertaining what sort of creature I was. Scarcely bigger than a\r\nwalnut, with a tiny “chirp, chirp,” these dainty creatures seemed to be\r\nintroducing themselves politely to me, and deprecating any possible\r\nunfriendliness that might have arisen, or might thereafter arise between\r\nus on account of an occasional seed stolen from my stack. At one time I\r\nhad the notion to capture one or more of these little birds and train\r\nthem as pets; but their courage and confidence utterly disarmed me.\r\n\r\nWhen all the vine ribs had been fitted to the boat the next thing was to\r\napply an exterior sheathing. This also I constructed of the long smooth\r\ncreepers, uniform in size and laid close together each piece extending\r\nthe whole length of the boat. I secured the ends of these vines to the\r\nstem and stern pieces by setting them into a groove or rebate, and\r\ndowelling a piece of wood down firmly upon them. At intervals I sewed or\r\ntied the rib and plank vines together with strong thin cord. When this\r\nwas done I had the form of a boat, but of course it would leak like a\r\nsieve, and moreover would be crank as a basket. The next thing was to\r\nprocure some sort of gum or resin, with which to coat the whole\r\nstructure and thus bind it all together and strengthen it, as well as to\r\nmake it water-tight.\r\n\r\nThere were trees of the pine or fir species growing on the island, high\r\non the rocky backbone. I could see them distinctly, and had little doubt\r\nthat they would furnish me with at least some of the ingredients for a\r\nsort of pitch, that might be made to answer my purpose. Up to this time\r\nI had never ascended the precipitous rocks and cliffs which formed a\r\nminiature mountainrange running north and south through the centre of\r\nthe island. Now I resolved to make the attempt and to ascertain\r\ndefinitely what could be found there in the way of pitch or resin, among\r\nthe several species of evergreens. To ascend these cliffs and rocks\r\nthrough the thickets and tangled vines was no easy task. Giant beds of\r\nfern, fallen tree-trunks, jungles of thorny bush, barred the way\r\napparently at all points. The most feasible route seemed to be up a\r\nchasm through which came a tinkling rivulet to join the stream, with\r\nmany a fall and leap, boiling now, and now dashing in spray over the\r\nfern-embowered rocks. It was a hard, hot climb. The humming-birds, like\r\nflying jewels,--rubies, topazes, amethysts, lapis lazuli,--darted to and\r\nfro in a dozen varieties, pausing to hover over the deep, scarlet\r\nchalices of the trumpet flower. Far above in the clear, deep blue of\r\nheaven slowly swung a circling vulture on motionless wing, a mere speck\r\nagainst the light.\r\n\r\nAt last I reached the top, a sort of broken rocky plateau covered with\r\ntrees among which were numerous evergreens. After a brief rest to\r\nrecover breath, I examined some of the trees, and found to my great\r\ndelight a species of pitch pine among them. The scaly, reddish bark was\r\nbedewed with tears of gum which I knew would with a little boiling or\r\ndrying be converted into a hard resin. Without losing any time I went to\r\nwork with my knife upon the trees. I bared a place of its bark on each\r\nof a dozen trunks, about three feet in height and six inches in width,\r\nand cut a notch at the bottom to collect the gum, scoring the bared\r\nplace with cross cuts at intervals of a few inches. This occupied me\r\nuntil it was within two hours of sunset, and I dared stay no longer that\r\nday, for fear of being benighted on the way home.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning I returned with my lasso, an earthenware vessel, and\r\nmy burning-glass. The wounded trees had already begun to yield a supply\r\nof sticky sap or gum, which I scraped down and collected in the earthen\r\npot, until it was quite full. I placed this to melt and boil over a slow\r\nfire and proceeded to wound about a dozen more trees. That night I slept\r\non the summit, and worked hard all next day collecting and boiling the\r\nresin, so that when I went the next night to the house I was able to\r\ncarry with me twenty-five or thirty pounds of the material,--a hard,\r\ndark resin.\r\n\r\nAt this labor I spent about a week longer, sometimes going home at\r\nnight, and sometimes sleeping on the rocks, until I had got together, as\r\nI thought, sufficient for my purpose. Now I wanted some grease to mix\r\nwith the resin, and concluded to kill a pig for this purpose. I had to\r\nwait two days to find the herd, but finally succeeded in capturing a\r\nfine young porker, which yielded a good store of lard and fat, much more\r\nindeed than I needed for the pitch kettle, as well as a fine supply of\r\nfresh pork-chops and some meat for the smoke-house.\r\n\r\nI melted the resin in my five-gallon pot, and added to it sufficient\r\nmelted pig-fat, so that the pitch when cold would be quite stiff and\r\nhard, but not brittle. With this hot, tenacious pitch I payed the whole\r\nexterior of the boat with a good thick coat, penetrating and filling all\r\nthe interstices. When this was hard and cold I tried to lift the boat\r\nfrom the clay core in order to turn it over. To my disgust I found that\r\nthe pitch had stuck it fast to the core in a thousand places, so that it\r\ncould not be moved. There was nothing to do, therefore, except to\r\nundermine the whole structure, dig the sand out, and take out the dry,\r\nhard clay from below, piece by piece,--an immense labor, as you may well\r\nconceive. But this was finally accomplished without injury to the boat.\r\nI found that the structure was entirely too flexible for practical\r\nnavigation, and that it would be necessary to deck over the greater\r\npart, if for no other reason than to stiffen it. I decided to make an\r\nair-tight compartment at each end, extending about three feet, and carry\r\na deck fore and aft over the entire boat, excepting a well hole in the\r\nmiddle, six feet long by three feet wide, which was to be surrounded by\r\na washboard, or raised edge, about six inches in height. Having cleared\r\naway the débris, I turned my boat right side up.\r\n\r\nI was very anxious to get this boat completed, and had been working hard\r\nat it every day for over a month. I wanted to know if it would at least\r\nfloat properly, and therefore labored from early dawn to dark without\r\ncessation. One night I had been restless and wakeful, and got up without\r\nappetite for parched seed and smoked meat. Fancying this was merely from\r\nexcitement about the work, and from want of variety in diet, I concluded\r\nthat the next day I would knock off work for a time and go fishing. But\r\nwhen I went down to the shed and got to work I felt tired and languid.\r\nThere was a great pain in my head, chilly sensations ran up and down my\r\nback, and pains in the limbs and a general depression of spirits warned\r\nme of an approaching illness. Fearing a collapse I started for the\r\nhouse, when suddenly I grew faint and fell on the sand, and lay there\r\nfor several hours, a fierce fever raging through me. An intense thirst\r\nstimulated my feeble energies to make one or two attempts to reach the\r\nhouse; but I failed and crawled back to the shed. Once I managed to\r\nreach the creek and get a drink, but it was preferable to suffer thirst,\r\nI thought, rather than make the attempt again. About sundown the fever\r\nleft me, and though much weakened I felt well enough to get to the\r\nhouse, light a candle from the last sparks of my neglected fire, and\r\nturn into my hammock.\r\n\r\nEvidently I was seized with some malarious disorder. Anxious to know\r\nwhat I could do for myself in the way of medicine, I got the\r\nDispensatory and began a search for febrifuges. I could not hope to find\r\nPeruvian bark on the island as this region was, I conceived, out of its\r\nhabitat. However, I made pencil notes of everything I could find\r\nmentioned as a febrifuge. Among other things I noted that it was\r\ncustomary in the Campagna near Rome for the fever-stricken inhabitants\r\nto make a sort of tea of sliced lemons, which was said to cure the\r\nCampagna fever. Now I remembered to have seen wild limes growing along\r\nthe upper part of the creek, and thought if I could get strength enough\r\nto gather some the next day I would try an infusion of them.\r\n\r\nThat night I slept pretty well, and in the morning got up feeling fairly\r\nwell. But warned by yesterday’s experience, I dreaded a recurrence of\r\nthe chill and fever, either that day or the next. So I went immediately\r\nand gathered a quantity of the ripest of the limes. These I sliced thin\r\nwith my knife and poured boiling water over them in a small vessel, and\r\nset them aside to steep. As soon as the infusion was cold I took a small\r\nsip to see what the effect would be. I found no bad consequences, and in\r\nan hour took another larger sip. This I kept up every hour all day, and\r\ndid some work on the boat. That night I drank about a quart of hot\r\nwater, and buried myself in a bed of dry grass in the house, with a\r\nsmall fire going. I was soon in a profuse perspiration, and after a\r\nwhile fell sound asleep and awoke in the morning hungry. Whether the\r\nlime tea checked the fever, or whether the attack was no more than a\r\npassing biliousness, I do not know. At any rate I soon recovered, and\r\nwas not ill again while on the island.\r\n\r\nI now resumed work persistently on the boat, and finally the air-tight\r\ncompartments and decking, made like the rest of the vessel of vines\r\ncoated with pitch, were done. I got some rollers under the boat and\r\npushed it into the creek, where it floated true and buoyant as I could\r\ndesire. Mooring it securely I got on board and found it stanch, and\r\nevery way much better than I had hoped. To my great joy it did not leak\r\na drop, though I had expected to have a great deal of patching to do.\r\n\r\nMy next task was to rig a mast and sail. The mast I had already brought\r\ndown from the heights, in the form of a slender evergreen, trimmed and\r\npeeled of its bark. Nor was I long in stepping and rigging it with the\r\nnecessary stays. The making of the sail was a much longer matter. I had\r\ngiven this question a great deal of thought, and while at work on the\r\nboat had carefully weighed several different devices, but had been\r\nunable to hit upon a feasible plan. Therefore I deferred it until the\r\nvery last thing, fitting on a rudder and even making and burning a water\r\njar and a cover for it to contain a supply of fresh water on board,\r\nbefore regularly beginning work on the sail. Finally, however, all was\r\nfinished except the sail, and I was forced to the task. The best thing I\r\ncould think of for the purpose was strips of bark woven on cord after\r\nthe fashion in which some window blinds are made from wooden slats and\r\ncord; and as this could best be used with what I believe is termed a\r\nlatteen rig, that is to say a single short mast in the centre of the\r\nboat, with a long yard suspended at its top and inclined upward from the\r\nbow aft, upon which the sail is hung, I changed my mast and stepped it\r\nto suit such a rig. Then I procured a long, slender, tapering pole for a\r\nyard. I found a tree with a smooth, flexible inner bark, and after a\r\ngreat deal of labor secured a sufficient quantity, cut in strips one and\r\na half inches in width, and some of it as long as the boom. Then I spun\r\na great quantity of cord, and tied doubled lengths of it to the boom at\r\nintervals of a foot. Then laying the boom down on the beach I placed a\r\nstrip of the bark alongside it and tied it there with all the cords; by\r\nthe side of that I added another a little shorter and tied it, and so on\r\nuntil I had built up a triangular sail of the bark strips attached to\r\nthe boom by the cords, the strips running parallel with the boom. In\r\norder to make it hold the wind better, I punched holes in the edges of\r\nthe bark strips, and tied the edges of adjacent strips together.\r\n\r\nWhen I had this sail complete and rigged to the mast the wind was\r\nblowing away from the shore, and I had to wait until the next day to\r\ngive it a trial. But I made everything ready, including food and water\r\nand a ballasting of stones, and on the next morning, the wind blowing\r\nquietly on shore, I went on board, cast off, and poled the craft out of\r\nthe creek, watching a good chance to push her through the breakers at\r\nthe bar. I got safely out, and hoisted the sail. For a moment she fell\r\noff and rose and sunk with the swell, but taking the wind fair,\r\npresently leaned down until the lee gunwale was nearly buried in the\r\ngreen water, and began to forge ahead rapidly, fairly sliding through\r\nthe water, with the wake running away behind and a white curl of foam\r\nracing from the bow. I tried her on all tacks, on and off the wind,\r\nratching and running before it, and found that the best point of sailing\r\nwas on the wind. This was entirely satisfactory. So delighted was I with\r\nthe operation of the boat that I tacked away in stretches of two or\r\nthree miles until I had beat up a good league from the island, and then\r\nturned and ran before the wind straight for the creek, where I arrived\r\nsafe, and moored the boat securely in her snug harbor.\r\n\r\nThe building of this boat had taken me three months; but it was at last\r\nfinished, and offered me a means, at the first fair wind, of sailing\r\naway for Martinique or some adjacent island, a port which I could fairly\r\nexpect to make in two or three days at farthest. I went to bed that\r\nnight in a happier and more contented frame of mind than I had\r\ntheretofore experienced on the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n“DUKE 2D, PROPERTY OF H. SENLIS.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the wind next day was in the wrong quarter, I set deliberately about\r\nlading my new boat, as far as my means went, with all the provisions and\r\nappliances that seemed necessary for the voyage. This was all done by\r\nnoon, and I sat down idly to wait for a wind that should promise settled\r\nweather, and be in the right direction. The first, second, and third\r\ndays passed without any prospect of change, and I grew very impatient.\r\nThings seemed to have lost their interest for me. The one idea of\r\ngetting away drove all else out of mind. I walked to and fro along the\r\nbeach like a caged animal, overhauled my cargo, added to it, changed the\r\nwater in my storage jar, and did a hundred useless things. Still the\r\nbreeze blew softly and steadily from the south of east,--a head wind,\r\nwhich would oblige me to ratch all the way to Martinique.\r\n\r\nOn the third night, as I was sitting out on the beach in the moonlight,\r\nI bethought me of the ancient rhyme of the mariner who, cursed by\r\neverlasting head winds, toiled on day by day only to be blown back night\r\nafter night. There was plenty of time now to plan what I should do when\r\nI reached Martinique. Up to this time I had not thought it out very\r\ncarefully. So to pass the dreary hours I began to go over the whole\r\nprogramme mentally. The more I thought about it, however, the less\r\nprospect could I see of getting at Martinique what appliances and\r\nassistance I wanted, even if I had possessed money enough. I should\r\nhave to go clear back to New York to get another diving apparatus, and\r\nthat of itself would consume the greater part of my funds.\r\n\r\nWhen this conviction forced itself on my mind, I was aghast. Must I give\r\nup the search for the treasureship merely for lack of funds, after all\r\nmy trouble and expense? I sprang up and began walking up and down the\r\nsand at the very edge of the breakers, like a wild man. Abandon my\r\nenterprise? Never, never! I would rather stay and die on the island than\r\ndo that. Why not, indeed, stay on the island and take my chances. I had\r\nbuilt a boat out of nothing, and why could I not contrive some means for\r\nat least finding the sunken galleon and locating it accurately? Then,\r\nwith something definite in prospect, it would surely not be difficult to\r\ngo to Martinique and there interest somebody else to furnish the\r\nnecessary funds for the enterprise, and divide the proceeds. There\r\nseemed to be wisdom in this course, and I resolved to adopt it\r\nforthwith.\r\n\r\nEven as I made this resolution a heavy cloud passed over the moon, a\r\nfaint breeze stirred through the rattling palm-leaves, and putting up a\r\nmoistened finger I found the wind had changed to the southwest; soon it\r\nbegan to increase, and in an hour there was a fine steady breeze blowing\r\nexactly from the best quarter for my voyage, if I had chosen to take\r\nadvantage of it. I was thankful at that moment that it had not come\r\nsooner. I looked long and musingly upon the darkening water and it must\r\nhave been nearly midnight when, after seeing carefully to the security\r\nof my boat, I turned into the hammock with a contented mind, and buoyed\r\nup by a firm resolve to succeed.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, as I was going down to the stream, I saw approaching\r\nalong the sands a dog. Nothing could have been more astonishing to me\r\nthan this sight. What could a dog be doing on this island? When and how\r\ndid he get here? Where dogs are, there also are men. This dog could\r\nnever have come here alone. The animal saw me as soon as I saw him, and\r\ncame running up wagging his tail in the most friendly way, running\r\naround in half-circles, and barking with delight. I called him up and\r\nstroked his head. He was a fine black Gordon setter, with an intelligent\r\nhigh-bred appearance. Around his neck a chain collar bore a plate\r\nengraved “Duke 2d, property of H. Senlis.” “Duke, good Duke,” said I,\r\n“where is your master?” But the only answer Duke could make was a series\r\nof delighted contortions, jumps, and short barks. I went to the house\r\nand got some dried turtle-meat, which he ate voraciously, and seemed to\r\ncall for more. When I had fed him all he seemed to demand he curled up\r\non the sand as contentedly as though this was a long sought\r\nresting-place. With his head over one paw and one eye occasionally\r\nopening to look at me, he was the very picture of contentment and\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nAs I sat eating my breakfast of parched-seed gruel and broiled bacon,\r\nand looking at the dog curled up on the sandy floor of my house, I\r\nspeculated on the method of his arrival on the island. Was he\r\nshipwrecked like myself, or left by some hunting party? Was he here\r\nalone, or were those to whom he belonged still on the island; and if so\r\nwhere were they? The whole island was not above six or seven miles in\r\nlength, and three or four in breadth. Yet the dense forest growth, the\r\njungles and cane-brakes, the central ridge of precipitous rocks could\r\neasily conceal the presence of other people, especially if they were on\r\nthe other side. At any rate I thought it high time for me to take a\r\ncareful survey of the entire domain, and this, if for no other purpose,\r\nto satisfy my curiosity aroused by the startling advent of Duke 2d.\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw the dog he was coming up apparently from the southern\r\nend of the island, and I concluded to start in that direction down the\r\nbeach, and go as far as possible along the sea,--quite around the whole\r\nisland if that were practicable. With this view I packed my haversack\r\nwith provisions, and filled my large bottle with fresh water, and swung\r\nit by a cord under my arm. Taking my lasso and lance and burning-glass,\r\nI started down the beach. Duke followed or ran on before, as much\r\npleased apparently as though we were on a gunning expedition. The beach\r\nextended south from my house for a distance of about three miles, and\r\nthen terminated in a low, rocky shore covered with cactus and thorny\r\nshrubs. Beyond this the southernmost extremity of the island extended in\r\na rocky headland, and there were some low rocks detached from the shore\r\nand covered at high tide, forming dangerous breakers, to which a\r\nnavigator rounding the southern cape would wish to give a wide berth.\r\n\r\nIn the sand and among the rocks where the cactus grew I captured an\r\narmadillo. This harmless little creature, about the size of a sucking\r\npig, was called to my attention by the dog, which had discovered it and\r\nseemingly did not know what to make of such a strange customer, covered\r\nwith its curious, horny armor. Duke was sniffing and jumping back and\r\nbarking, when I caught sight of the hindquarters of the armadillo just\r\ndisappearing in the sand. The animal was burrowing itself out of sight\r\nwith astonishing rapidity in the loose soil. At first I could not\r\nconceive what it was, as it appeared from the view I had more like some\r\nsort of a reptile than an animal. But I speedily recognized it, and\r\npulled it bodily out of the tunnel it was excavating. The little fellow\r\ndid not attempt to run away, but curled itself up into a ball with its\r\nhead and feet tucked out of sight. Duke went up to it and turned it\r\nseveral times over with his paw, but evidently could have inflicted no\r\ninjury upon it had he been minded to make the attempt. However, as roast\r\narmadillo is noted as a savory dish I speedily put an end to its life by\r\ninserting my knife blade between the joints of its armor, and it was\r\nadded to our larder at once.\r\n\r\nWe now crossed over through the rocks to the west shore, which was\r\nformed, so far as I could see, of rocks and cliffs, which rose bolder\r\nand higher toward the north. The travelling along these cliffs was very\r\nbad, and at a break I descended to the narrow margin of sand and rocks\r\nat their feet, left bare by the receding tide. Here the walking was\r\nfairly good, and we made our way along at a good pace for a mile. Now\r\nthe shore rose boldly up in a sheer cliff nearly a hundred feet in\r\nheight, and the beach was little more than a mass of fallen rock. In a\r\nshallow indentation or bay we, or rather the dog, discovered bubbling up\r\nthrough the sand a spring of cold, pure water which must have been under\r\nthe sea at high tide. There was also an abundance of small oysters\r\nattached to the rocks, and I ate of them for my lunch.\r\n\r\nAt this spring I refilled my water bottle and sat down to rest in the\r\nshade of the rocks. The dog seemed very uneasy for some reason, and\r\nthinking there might be some animal about, I got up and looked around.\r\nTo my great alarm I soon discovered that the tide had risen so far as\r\npartly to submerge some of the rocks that were dry when I had passed a\r\nhalf-hour before. It would be no trifling matter to be caught in this\r\nplace by the tide; but whether it were best to go on or go back I could\r\nnot tell. However, as I knew the road behind me I determined to retrace\r\nmy steps. I had not gone a quarter of a mile before I found that it\r\nwould be impossible to pass in that direction. Whether it would be\r\npracticable to proceed in the other I could not foresee; it was so\r\ndoubtful that I had no time to lose. So I hurried back again to the\r\nspring, where a margin of sand was still uncovered by the rising waves.\r\nHere I soon found that advance as well as retreat along the water was\r\ncut off. Above me frowned the perpendicular cliffs. The situation seemed\r\nfull of desperate peril, and was grave enough in all reason.\r\n\r\nI felt much as one might fancy a rat feels when the door of the trap\r\nsnaps on him, and breathless he circles about and finds no exit. Duke\r\nwas crouched down and shivering as with an instinct of apprehension.\r\nThere was a sense of numb despair with it all--a sickening sense of\r\ngiving up the fight, as though it were useless to strive against brutal\r\nill fortune. Why did I ever come into this rat-trap? Now a man should\r\nnot waste any time or thought on vain repinings, self indignation or\r\naccusation, under such circumstances, but turn his attention to the real\r\nquestion, and keep his eye fixed firmly and singly on the main chance.\r\nBut it is not always easy to think when and of what you ought. Indeed, I\r\nfound myself speculating as to how the end would come. Inch by inch the\r\nwater would creep up. Duke would first be swept under, unless I chose to\r\nsupport him for a while. Then little by little I would be submerged,\r\nknees, middle, chest, shoulders, neck, chin, lips,--and then the final\r\nstruggle. I cast my eyes up to see how far above my height the water\r\nwould rise. The marks of high water were there plain on the cliff, and I\r\ncalculated that I should be submerged at least eight feet at high water.\r\n\r\nAll along, the rock rose sheer up without a break to the very top.\r\nThere was one place, however, where the cliff, undermined by the waves,\r\nhad split off and fallen down, making a ledge about twenty-five or\r\nthirty feet above the water’s edge; but there seemed to be no way of\r\nclimbing up to this ledge,--indeed it overhung the base. Upon it grew\r\ntwo or three small trees, and one of them leaned out over the sea. When\r\nmy faculties once more began to assert themselves, it occurred to me\r\nthat it might be possible to cast the end of my lasso over this\r\nprojecting tree-trunk and thus perhaps haul myself up to the ledge hand\r\nover hand.\r\n\r\nThe conception of this idea was almost equivalent to its execution; I\r\nfelt that I was saved. To one end of the lasso I tied a stone, and\r\nsecured the other end firmly around the body of the dog. This stone I\r\ncast easily over the tree trunk, and swung the rope in such a manner\r\nthat the weighted end would twist several times around the body of the\r\nrope. I pulled and tested it with my weight, and it held firm. Casting\r\nmy lance up on the ledge, I climbed hand over hand up the rope,\r\noccasionally steadying myself with feet against the rock, until I had a\r\nfirm grasp on the trunk and was safely on the platform. Leaning over I\r\ncalled to the dog, and when he came up close to the rock I spoke to him\r\nkindly to allay his fears, and then hauled him up. The platform was at\r\nleast ten feet wide at the middle part, perhaps forty feet long, and\r\ntapered away to a mere ledge at each end. There was plenty of dry dead\r\nsticks and wood which had fallen down from above, and, as the afternoon\r\nsun shone hot and bright in the western sky, it was not long before I\r\nhad kindled a fire with my burning-glass, and had spitted the armadillo\r\nfor a roast.\r\n\r\nI now sat and watched the sea rise and wash in breakers on the base of\r\nthe cliff, and shuddered to think what would have been my fate but for\r\nthe lasso and the timely aid it afforded me. I watched a glorious\r\nsunset wherein long bars of purple cloud edged with molten gold, and\r\nfleecy flakes of burning vermilion melted on a sky of gray-green light,\r\nover an ocean of dark blue shot with violet, and here and there tinted\r\nand gilded with crimson and gold from the red, flaming ball that was\r\njust dipping to the horizon. And far into the night I sat awaiting the\r\nrising of the moon, the novelty of the situation driving all inclination\r\nfor sleep from me. Duke was a good companion, and inclined to sit out\r\nthe company. He lay with his head on my knee, occasionally looking up\r\ninto my face in a truly sociable and friendly manner.\r\n\r\nAbout nine o’clock at night, there being then a dead calm, I heard\r\ndistinctly the beat of a screw propeller, accompanied by the regular\r\nblowing at slow intervals of escaping steam. I looked all about for the\r\nvessel, and presently made out her mast-head light, like a star\r\nquivering on the horizon. Gradually it lifted above the water in the\r\nsouthern sky, and I knew it would pass me quite near at hand unless its\r\ncourse were changed. There were still some embers of my fire alight, and\r\nnothing would have been easier than to make a signal which doubtless\r\nwould have been seen on board. But though I gathered the embers together\r\ninstinctively, I took no step toward making the signal. She drew nearer\r\nand nearer, and finally passed along the coast not half a mile distant,\r\ntrailing a long plume of smoke. So near was she at one time that in the\r\nstarlight and upon the light of the sea I could distinguish her form and\r\nbuild, and conjectured that she was some ocean tramp, sliding along\r\nstern deep down, and nose cocked out of the water, looking for a cargo\r\nfrom port to port,--an iron steamer, such as are sent out by thousands\r\nnow-a-days to wander over all the seas and oceans, and which, going\r\nfrom port to port, finally return to the home port, perhaps when it is\r\ntime to lay their sides and ribs into the junk heap for old iron.\r\n\r\nWhen the moon rose the steamer was a pale, gray spot at the end of a\r\nlong stain of dark smoke far in the northern horizon. It finally\r\ndisappeared, the smoke fading away and mingling with the faint\r\nmist-wreaths that stole up from the sea under the moonlight. I went to\r\nbed on the rock with Duke coiled up beside me, and slept until broad\r\nday. I found the water still too high for me to descend safely to the\r\nsand; the tide had apparently gone out and was coming in again. I did\r\nnot much like the idea of descending again to the foot of the cliff if\r\nit could be avoided, because there was no telling whether I could safely\r\nproceed farther to the north; nor was I yet ready to go back home, for I\r\nintended, if possible, to make the complete circuit of the island.\r\n\r\nTherefore I turned my attention to that portion of the cliff that rose\r\nabove my ledge. After a careful scrutiny I concluded it would be\r\npossible to reach the top by climbing a tree that grew close to the\r\nrock. A narrow ledge could be reached from the upper limbs, and it led\r\nalong the face of the rocks for a few steps to a sort of crack or chasm\r\nup which one might easily clamber to the top. I climbed down to the\r\nbeach as soon as the water was low enough, and filled my bottle anew at\r\nthe spring, Duke howling and barking all the time, as though in great\r\ndistress at being deserted. I returned to the ledge, fastened the end of\r\nthe lasso around the dog, and climbed up the tree with my lance,\r\nhaversack, and water bottle. With some difficulty I reached the chasm\r\nsafely, and proceeded to haul up the dog. From there the climbing was\r\nnot difficult to the top.\r\n\r\nHere was a considerable forest, similar to the growth on the central\r\nmountainous plateau of the island where I went for pitch. Indeed, as\r\nwell as I could then see, and as afterward I found to be the case, this\r\nline of cliffs was connected with the central plateau by a ridge running\r\neast and west. There was a valley between the cliffs and the plateau,\r\ndivided into two parts by this transverse ridge. The travelling through\r\nthe woods on the cliff was not difficult, as there was very little\r\nundergrowth.\r\n\r\nI made a discovery in this wood of several lofty trees which bore nuts\r\nof the triangular variety known as Brazil nuts. They grow enclosed in a\r\nhard outer casing like a small cannon-ball. One of these fell as I\r\npassed beneath the tree. If it had struck Duke or me there is no\r\nestimating the hurt that would have been occasioned. It fell fairly on a\r\nprojecting root, and burst open, scattering the loose nuts about. I\r\ngathered a haversack full and filled my shirt and pockets, casting\r\nuneasy glances the while up into the trees in fear of a possible\r\nbombardment from above; nor did we linger long under those dangerous\r\nlimbs.\r\n\r\nPushing along, as near the edge of the cliffs as possible, we came, near\r\nthe middle of the island, north and south, to a well beaten path leading\r\ndown toward the sea through a break in the cliffs. Duke immediately\r\nbounded down this path, and I followed him anxiously; for it did not\r\nlook as though made by pigs, but rather as if trodden by human feet. The\r\nnarrow gorge speedily widened out into a little bowl-shaped valley, open\r\nto the sea on one side, and on three sides walled in by the cliffs,\r\nwhich were hung with luxuriant vegetation,--a most lovely spot. A gently\r\nsloping sward extended nearly to the pebbly beach, and a little stream\r\nof clear water, which came frothing in haste down the glen, paused in a\r\nquiet sweep and curve through the meadow, the long grass bending over\r\nits narrow course, and dipping into the limpid surface, till finally it\r\nflowed down over a bed of bright-colored pebbles to the little bay in\r\nfront. Here and there a wide-spreading tree cast a broad, purple shadow,\r\nand many flowers sent forth fragrance to the pure, warm air. It was\r\ntruly a sylvan paradise.\r\n\r\nWhat specially interested me, however, was the white gleam of canvas\r\nshining through the foliage. A tent was pitched near the stream. I\r\ncalled out to announce my presence, but nobody appeared, and going up to\r\nthe structure, I found it vacant and deserted. The tent was made of a\r\nhuge mainsail, stretched over a pole and secured to the ground by pegs.\r\nIt evidently had been long deserted, perhaps a month; the rains had\r\nwashed the ashes of a fire nearly all away. In the trunk of an adjacent\r\ntree stuck an axe, buried to the helve as though by a powerful hand. The\r\nmetal was all covered with red rust, and so firmly imbedded in the gash\r\nthat I could not release it until I had pounded it out with a stone. A\r\nfurther search disclosed a dish broken in half, a rusty case-knife, a\r\nhand-saw, an iron kettle, a frying-pan, which lay in the tent, and\r\nfragments of old newspapers and letters strewed about. In one corner\r\nwere two blankets rolled loosely together and somewhat mildewed. I\r\nhauled these blankets and also an old topsail out of the tent, and\r\nspread them in the sun to dry.\r\n\r\nThen I wandered about seeking some clew as to who had been here and how\r\nlong since; but conjecture was idle. At the mouth of the creek there was\r\na tree with the marks on it of a mooring line; and the trace of the line\r\nwas still faintly visible on the earthy bank. The most probable\r\nsupposition was that a party of pig-hunters had landed here, and for\r\nsome reason had been suddenly called away. That they had left hurriedly\r\nwas evident both from the standing tent and its contents, and also from\r\nthe fact that a garden had been planted, which was now grown up to rank\r\nluxuriance. In this garden was a great quantity of yams and sweet\r\npotatoes, most of them just in a condition to be gathered; also peas and\r\nbeans quite dry and ripe, and some Indian corn, the last still green. A\r\nrusty shovel and hoe were lying there just as they had been left. I made\r\nno scruple to help myself to what I wanted of this abundant harvest that\r\nchance had placed in my hand. It was not long before I had a fire built\r\nand the kettle on, and some of the yams and sweet potatoes boiling.\r\nThese vegetables eaten hot, with salt and bacon, were to my unaccustomed\r\npalate more delicious than I can describe. Duke also ate of them\r\nravenously.\r\n\r\nAbout two o’clock in the afternoon, after packing up the new-found\r\nproperty in the tent as securely as I could, I hurried away to the north\r\nalong the cliffs, anxious to reach home in order to get my boat and\r\nreturn for these treasures; for treasures indeed would this abundant\r\nsupply of food as well as the other things be to me. About a quarter of\r\na mile north of this little haven, which I named “Farm Haven,” the\r\ncliffs ran back from the sea, leaving a broad, smooth beach which gave\r\nan excellent road quite to the northern extremity of the island,\r\nexcepting at one place where I was obliged to wade waist deep across the\r\nmouth of a deep indenting cove. At the northern end were isolated rocks,\r\none of which rose boldly up to a height of fifty or sixty feet and was\r\nsurrounded by the water even at low tide. After clambering over the\r\nrocks for an eighth of a mile I struck again the smooth, incurving beach\r\nthat margined the eastern shore, and before dark reached home.\r\n\r\nEverything about the house was just as I had left it, and the boat was\r\ngently heaving to the modified swell that penetrated in gentle\r\nundulations to its safe harbor in the creek. I sat long that evening\r\nenjoying the cool air, and speculating on the events of my journey. I\r\nhad not found Duke’s master, but could account at least in some measure\r\nfor his presence on the island; for he had been undoubtedly forgotten in\r\nthe hurried departure of the party whose camp I had just visited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE WATER-GLASS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning broke fair with a gentle breeze from the west, which would\r\nenable me to make the run easily in a couple of hours. I put on board\r\ntwo light poles which might, if necessary, serve for oars, and rigged a\r\ncouple of loops on the washboard at each side, through which to thrust\r\nthem when they were to be used. After taking on board a supply of water,\r\nand food enough for several days in case I should chance to be blown out\r\nto sea, and not forgetting my lasso and burning-glass, I called Duke on\r\nboard, hoisted the sail, and cast off. Out through the creek mouth, over\r\nthe bar, and through its breakers slid the little craft, and as soon as\r\nwe were fairly outside I bore up and ran straight for the north cape,\r\nwith a fair beam wind. The fresh morning air, the dew still wet on the\r\nboat, the sun scarce a span above the sea, the cool, blue water sliding\r\nby, the breaking of the surf as it ran angling along the strand, all\r\nacted like a cordial to my spirits. Duke sat up in the bottom of the\r\nboat eyeing the whole proceeding with a critical air, hardly willing to\r\nyield an entirely unqualified approval, and yet not ready to advance any\r\npositive objection. I fairly burst into a laugh at his quizzical\r\nexpression. He sprang up wagging his tail and came to me and laid his\r\nhead on my knee, as much as to say, “It is all right, I see.”\r\n\r\nBefore reaching the cape I eased off a little with the intention of\r\nrunning approximately over the region where the sunken galleon was\r\nsupposed to lie. The spot, according to the admiral’s account, was about\r\na mile east of north from the rocky point, and I wanted to sound as far\r\nout in this direction as my forty-foot line would allow, if, as I hoped,\r\nthere should chance to be any shallow that would allow me to reach\r\nbottom at all near the shore. The yellowish color of the water off the\r\ncape gave token of an extensive shoal in this direction, as did also the\r\npeculiar action of the swell, which seemed half inclined to break as it\r\npassed. With a stone tied to the line, I sounded as soon as I passed the\r\ncape, and found at two hundred yards from shore not over twenty feet of\r\nwater. This depth increased very gradually until the full length of the\r\nline, forty feet or thereabouts, ran out at a distance of an eighth of a\r\nmile from the shore, showing that there was a long shoal or submerged\r\nspit extending out from the north end of the island.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I left the immediate vicinity of the shore, where the\r\nbreakers stirred up the bottom, the water became beautifully clear and\r\ntransparent, so that at my last sounding I saw, or fancied I saw, the\r\ngleam of the bright sand shining up from below. I now lowered the sail\r\nto test if there was any current running, but beyond a slight movement,\r\nI could detect nothing. I was now far enough from the cape so that I\r\ncould take a slant to the southwest and easily clear the rocks. So I\r\nhauled up the sail and brought her head around. Soon we were spinning\r\nalong the western shore, and in an hour were off the “Farm Haven,”\r\ntoward which I turned, and running into the mouth of the little stream\r\nmoored the boat safely and landed.\r\n\r\nThere was a busy day before me, and I lost no time in beginning work.\r\nFirst of all, I threw the ballast overboard to make room for a cargo of\r\nyams and potatoes. I next wove out of willow branches a rough basket,\r\nor rather a sort of shallow tray, to carry them to the boat. I dug and\r\nloaded fully five bushels of fine, clean sweet potatoes and a number of\r\nlarge yams, and the supply remaining in the ground would have filled my\r\nboat a half-dozen times. I next turned my attention to the dry peas and\r\nbeans, and gathered about a bushel of each, besides a number of great\r\nscarlet pepper-pods. Then I took down the tent and put it aboard, as\r\nwell as the axe, the shovel, the hoe, and the sail and blankets. I\r\nboiled a lot of yams for dinner, and this being over at about three in\r\nthe afternoon, I called Duke and went up the gully path to the top and\r\nlooked about a little to see what prospect there might be for a path\r\nover the island to the other side. In a straight east and west line the\r\ndistance could not be over three and a half to four miles.\r\n\r\nThere was a ridge running back from the cliff to the central plateau,\r\nwhich I thought might afford an easy path, and I knew that once on this\r\ncentral plateau I could descend to the stream and so reach home. Having\r\nseen this much I returned to the boat, and casting off poled out as far\r\nas possible to get an offing. By short tacks I managed finally to get\r\nfar enough to venture on my northern slant. But the sun was almost down\r\nwhen I rounded the north cape and started down the other shore.\r\n\r\nJust as I came opposite the mouth of the creek, the wind died away, and\r\nI hastened to get out my rude poles and row into the harbor. This was a\r\nterrible task, and if the wind had not gone down I much doubt whether I\r\ncould have done it at all until the tide turned. But at last we made the\r\ncreek and moored the boat safely with its precious cargo. I was too\r\ntired that night to do more than unload the tools, blankets, canvas,\r\nand cooking utensils, leaving the vegetables on board till morning. That\r\nnight being oppressively warm, I swung my hammock under the open\r\nwork-shed, and lulled by the music of the breakers, slept soundly until\r\nbroad day.\r\n\r\nThe first work on hand was the care of my cargo of potatoes. These with\r\nthe beans and peas I carried up to the dark, dry store-room. Some of the\r\npotatoes I buried in the dry sand, to test its preservative properties.\r\nAs a future provision I turned up with the spade a little patch of soil\r\nnear the creek and planted half a dozen hills of yams and potatoes in a\r\nfavorable spot, and a row of the beans and peas, guarding the latter\r\nfrom the birds with a layer of brush. This occupied the greater part of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I drew a wire nail out of the chest, with which to make\r\na fish-hook. The back of the axe formed a good anvil, and the shank of\r\nthe hoe, the wooden handle being removed, did fairly well for a hammer.\r\nWith these tools I fashioned the red-hot nail into hook form, using for\r\ntongs a pair of clam shells. I drew the point out sharp, bent the hook,\r\nand cut a barb over the edge of the axe. The head of the nail was left\r\nintact to secure the line. As this was my first effort at blacksmithing\r\nthe hook was not perhaps as elegant as it might have been, but it looked\r\nas though it might work satisfactorily. For a line, I unlaid and\r\nretwisted some pieces of hempen rope that had formed reef points on the\r\nsail of the tent, and coated them well with candle-berry wax. I made a\r\nwooden float for a bob and fitted a stone for a sinker, so that by\r\nbed-time, my fishing-tackle was finished, together with a good hundred\r\nfeet of stout line.\r\n\r\nThat night a rain set in, and it continued steadily for three days\r\nwithout ceasing, varying only between a violent downpour and a fine,\r\ndriving mist from the northeast. I could not work out of doors in such\r\nweather; so, gathering a great quantity of cocoanut husks, I busied\r\nmyself hour after hour spinning cöir. I wanted to make a good, strong,\r\nsounding-line at least a hundred fathoms long, and a line of equal\r\nlength by which to anchor a buoy as a guide in the submarine search\r\noperations. Thus the time was by no means lost, though the confinement\r\nwas exceedingly irksome. Duke made an occasional dash out into the wet,\r\nand once returned carrying in his mouth an armadillo rolled up tight in\r\na ball, which afforded us a variation in diet.\r\n\r\nBut the sky finally cleared and I hastened out to try my fishing-tackle.\r\nAnchoring the boat just beyond the breakers at the mouth of the creek, I\r\nbaited my hook with a shell-fish and cast it over, letting the line run\r\nslowly out as the hook sank toward the bottom, and then hauling it up\r\nand repeating the operation. Presently I got a tremendous bite, and drew\r\nin a fish that weighed about fifteen pounds. It was a red snapper, and\r\nproved most excellent eating. This was fishing enough for once, and I\r\npulled to shore and set about cooking part of my prize. Soon the air was\r\nredolent with the odor of fried fish, and both Duke and I regaled\r\nourselves with fish and potatoes, washing them down with pure, sweet\r\nwater cool from the porous water-jar.\r\n\r\nI now set about the construction of an apparatus by the aid of which I\r\nhoped to be able to make a reconnaissance of the bottom of the shallow\r\nsea, where the sunken galleon was supposed to lie. I went out with my\r\naxe to the upland and cut down a fine cedar tree. This I split until I\r\nprocured four rough but slight slabs, an inch thick and about a foot in\r\nwidth, sawing them to a length of about three feet. I pinned these\r\nsecurely together in the form of a rectangular tube a foot in diameter\r\nand three feet long, and in one end of the tube fitted a tight cedar\r\nbottom. In this bottom I cut an aperture just large enough to receive\r\none of my glass photograph plates, five inches by seven, and after\r\ncleaning off the sensitive gelatine coating securely fitted it in place\r\nlike a window. With melted pitch I payed freely all the joints and\r\nseams, so that the structure was perfectly water-tight, and then\r\nblackened the wood on the inside with a mixture of pulverized charcoal\r\nand hot wax, so that it would reflect no light.\r\n\r\nBefore this was finished the rains set in again and continued for a\r\nwhole week. I concluded that the annual rainy season must now be at\r\nhand. For though the sky would occasionally clear for a day or part of a\r\nday, the showers were so frequent that the house grew damp and\r\nunwholesome, and I was obliged to air it every day with a rousing fire\r\nin the fireplace, the heat of which drove me to seek shelter under the\r\nwork-shed. The weather was so uncertain that I did not dare to venture\r\nout in the boat further than a few hundred feet, and then with a line\r\nfast to the shore; this I occasionally did for the purpose of fishing,\r\nand always with good luck, catching the red snappers, rock cod, and\r\nvarious other varieties, all of which found their way to the larder.\r\n\r\nIt was on one of these occasions that I tried my new-made contrivance,\r\nthe water-glass. When the closed end of this was submerged over the side\r\nof the boat, by looking in at the open upper end I could plainly see the\r\nbottom and the fish swimming about my hook. Of course I was very anxious\r\nto try the apparatus in deeper water to ascertain how far the vision\r\ncould penetrate. But the weather would not render it possible without\r\ntoo great risk. The value of such a device would depend entirely upon\r\nthe clearness and depth of the water. I knew from written accounts that\r\nthe sponge fishers use a similar contrivance,--frequently a wooden\r\nbucket with a pane of glass in the bottom, which they call a “sponge\r\nglass,” and with which they search for sponges and conch shells in the\r\nBermudas, employing it with perfect success, in clear water, even at a\r\nconsiderable depth. The sponge glass enables the operator to overcome\r\nthe surface agitation and reflection of the water, just as a thin\r\ntransparent sheet of ice sometimes renders the bottom of a deep pond\r\nvisible to a skater.\r\n\r\nOne morning, when there was an almost perfect calm, I noticed on the\r\nsurface of the sea a long streak extending from a point about half a\r\nmile from shore away toward the eastern horizon until it was lost in the\r\ndistance. This appearance was so curious and inexplicable that after\r\ngazing at it for a while, both from the beach and from the top of a\r\npalm, I finally rowed the boat out to it, and found that it was muddy\r\nwater, with leaves, grass, and vegetation floating in it, and a great\r\nnumber of cocoanuts bobbing about among the other fragments and\r\ndetritus. It looked precisely as though the contents of some slack water\r\nlagoon connecting with the sea had been suddenly swept out by a freshet\r\nor some extraordinary current. Among the floating matter were\r\ninnumerable sea beans, as they are called,--a sort of nut or seed that\r\nis sometimes used as an ornament for watch chains,--also little scarlet,\r\negg-shaped seeds, like those that are picked up in such quantities on\r\nthe Florida beaches. But there was no sea-weed with the other detritus.\r\nThis mass of matter slowly travelled along the surface and by the next\r\nday was out of sight. I suppose to a more skilled observer the\r\nphenomenon might have proven a valuable aid in determining the set of\r\nthe currents, or other natural facts worthy of note.\r\n\r\nWhile out on this excursion I several times tried the water-glass, but\r\nfound the sea so charged with matter and so cloudy and milky that I\r\ncould see but indistinctly and to no great depth. This, however, did not\r\ndiscourage me, as I knew the water was likely to change in this respect\r\nfrom week to week.\r\n\r\nThere came upon the island at this time great numbers of pelicans. They\r\nwould light on the beach in large flocks, and sit there for hours,\r\napparently resting from a long flight; then all together, as by a\r\nconcerted signal, they would rise and in an irregular body wing their\r\nway to the south. Duke took great delight in hunting these birds, and\r\nwould watch by the hour for their arrival. As soon as a flock appeared\r\nin the northern sky he would prick up his ears, all attention, and wait\r\nuntil, circling about, they alighted. Then he would begin a deliberate\r\nattempt to stalk them, creeping along, belly to the ground, until nearly\r\nup to them, then making a bold rush, but always without success, the\r\nbirds on such occasions merely rising and circling to another\r\nresting-place. He would come in after this sport wet with the rain and\r\npanting with exertion, and appeared to look with reproach at my lack of\r\ninterest in the game, as though he would say, “Where is your gun, you\r\nidle fellow?” But I had no use for pelicans. Indeed, I still had too\r\nvivid a remembrance of the peculiar flavor of gull meat to hanker after\r\nfish-eating birds of any sort, as food. The white crane, or heron, and\r\nthe beautiful pink and white ibis also made their appearance\r\noccasionally in flocks; but they were so shy and difficult to approach\r\nthat I could never get within a hundred yards of them.\r\n\r\nPenetrating one morning, in spite of the drizzling rain, to a part of\r\nthe forest just under the rocky plateau, I came upon some trees about\r\nthirty or forty feet in height having flowers variegated with purple,\r\nyellow, green, and red, and bearing at the same time fruit in the form\r\nof great gourds. This I found was what is known as the calabash tree\r\n(_Crescentia cujete_). I collected a number, of different sizes, and\r\ncarried them home through the rain. The hard, wood-like shells could\r\nreadily be cut with the knife and saw, yet they were strong and tough.\r\nWith this raw material, already partially shaped to hand, I set about\r\nmaking various kinds of vessels,--domestic and culinary utensils, a\r\nwater-bottle to carry on my tramps and excursions, etc. With four great\r\ngourds lashed together I constructed a buoy for subsequent use in my\r\nmarine explorations, and with a number of small ones I made a\r\nlife-preserver as a part of my boat equipment. It was a great comfort to\r\nhave a dish to eat from once more. Indeed, I had often regretted that I\r\ndid not bring with me the two halves of the broken dish which I had seen\r\nat the “Farm Haven.” My two developing-trays with their deep sides had\r\nproved but inconvenient substitutes; besides, they were generally kept\r\nfor other uses. Taken altogether there was no single vegetable product\r\nof the island that contributed more to my comfort than the calabash\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nAs I now had plenty of canvas I concluded to rig my boat anew and change\r\nit from the awkward latteen rig to that of a sloop with mainsail and\r\njib. The want of a needle and thread to sew the sails was a great\r\ndrawback, but I made shift to use an awl made out of a leg of a compass\r\nbelonging to my drawing instruments, and for thread a slender cord made\r\nof cöir. I rigged the jib with a traverse so that it needed no special\r\nattention except to be hauled aft when I went about, and the mainsail\r\nwith a gaff and throat halliards, that it might be lowered by the run\r\nupon emergency; I also provided both jib and mainsail with three rows\r\nof reef points, that I might show little or much canvas, as the slate of\r\nthe wind should require. With axe and saw and knife I fashioned a good\r\npair of cedar oars, light and strong, and fitted thole-pins in the\r\ngunwales to receive them; I put a pair of thole-pins in the stern for\r\nsculling, and had a spare oar for use in case of breakage.\r\n\r\nThe weather continued stormy, with rain nearly every day, and frequently\r\nfor several days together without cessation. I passed most of the time\r\nunder the boat-shed, and generally slept there at night, as the climate\r\nwas very mild and warm notwithstanding the rains. Moreover, I had now\r\ntwo blankets to sleep in at night, and lay quite warm and comfortable in\r\nmy hammock. The house I used as a kitchen, dining-room, store-room, and\r\nlibrary. It was quite impossible to read elsewhere at night, for the\r\ncandle could not be kept alight in the open-sided shed. I read all the\r\nbooks through deliberately, including the German Word-book. I would lie\r\nin my swinging hammock by the hour during the day-time and read even the\r\nDispensatory faithfully through while the rain pattered on the roof,\r\nwith an occasional “swish, swish,” as the eddying wind drove it with\r\ngreater or less violence against the house. That I should find the dry\r\ndetails of a Dispensatory sufficiently interesting to make the\r\ncontinuous reading of them even endurable expresses well the desperate\r\ndulness of my lonesome surroundings. Duke slept much, and I envied him\r\nhis capacity for slumber. He would lie in a dry spot and snooze for\r\nfifteen minutes at a time, get up and gape and stretch, then lie down\r\nand shiver and drop to sleep with one eye open, and so alternating pass\r\nthe day. Sometimes I would practice on him with German words from the\r\nWord-book, which he understood, so far as I could see, quite as well as\r\nEnglish. At any rate, when I spoke he wagged his tail, and thus\r\ndemonstrated that he was a good fellow and not disposed in any degree to\r\ncriticise or find fault with the personal peculiarities or the language\r\nof a friend.\r\n\r\nAt last one clear, bright morning, when the birds were noisily rejoicing\r\nand the butterflies were out in their gala dresses, I undertook an\r\nexpedition by land to the “Farm Haven.” The creek was swollen deep with\r\nthe rains, so that I could not conveniently travel up the bed. Therefore\r\nI made my way north along the beach for a mile, and struck west through\r\nthe jungle at the most open place I saw. By an occasional use of the axe\r\nI forced a path through to the rocks, which happened here to be low, and\r\nspeedily gained the central plateau. At the point where I mounted the\r\nrocks I found great quantities of ripe whortleberries growing on low\r\nbushes, and of large size and exquisite flavor. I ate my fill of these\r\nand pressed on along the plateau looking for the connecting ridge. The\r\nwalking was not bad on this upland, as there was no tangled mass of\r\nundergrowth, and the trees grew well apart. The ridge was not difficult\r\nto find and proved easily passable, so that I made shift to reach the\r\ncliffs long before noon.\r\n\r\nBeing near them I went to the Brazil-nut trees and gathered a peck or\r\nmore of the nuts, filling my haversack quite full as well as my pockets.\r\nDuke here chased a little animal which I fancied must be what is called\r\nan agouti; but as he did not catch him I could not know positively.\r\nHowever, this persistent hunter soon after managed to tree an animal\r\nwhich I had no difficulty in recognizing as the familiar raccoon. I had\r\nno idea until I saw this specimen that this plantigrade was to be found\r\nin the Caribbean islands. There was, however, no mistaking the identity\r\nof the species. It was undoubtedly a genuine “coon.” The silver-tipped\r\nfur, the pointed snout, the barred tail all spoke in favor of a true\r\ndescent and a perfect relationship with the animal which I had so often\r\nhunted on moonlight nights in the woods at home. It was an undoubted\r\n“case of coon.” When I found him he was in a slender sapling, with Duke\r\nbarking below. I laid the axe to the trunk and speedily felled it to the\r\nground. Duke seized his victim before he could recover, and shook him as\r\na terrier would a rat. Running to his assistance I speedily put an end\r\nto the combat with my knife, and bagged the game. Here was material for\r\na feast, for I well knew by experience that roast coon is a morsel fit\r\nfor an epicure.\r\n\r\nFarm Haven looked beautifully fresh from the rains. I found the garden\r\nstill more choked with weeds, and the potatoes mostly gone to seed. I\r\ngathered a few to roast in the embers for my dinner, but most of them\r\nhad begun to decay. The Indian corn was ripe, and I took this occasion\r\nto gather it all, a good heap of perhaps ten bushels, which I carried\r\nlittle by little to a sheltered nook under the rocks and piled up\r\nwithout removing the husks. I started a good fire to roast some corn and\r\npotatoes. After dressing the coon I swung it by a cord in front of the\r\nfire where it was slowly turned by the twist of the cord first in one\r\ndirection and then in the other, requiring only an occasional twirl to\r\nkeep it going.\r\n\r\nWhile the dinner was cooking, Duke and I looked about the valley to see\r\nwhat could be found. We went over to the north of the mouth of the\r\nrivulet among some willows, to gather a few wands for basket-making. As\r\nsoon as we reached the other side of the stream I noticed a strong\r\nstench as of decayed animal matter. The source of this smell was soon\r\ndisclosed in a great heap of oysters. Great bivalves, some of them eight\r\nor more inches across, lay rotting in a pile on the pebbly shore. All\r\nabout were heaps of open shells and decayed shell-fish. It occurred to\r\nme at once that I had chanced upon the headquarters of a pearl fishery;\r\nand this accounted most satisfactorily for the encampment, but not for\r\nthe hurried departure of the campers. There was at least a ton of\r\nunopened oysters lying in the rotting drying-heap, and I determined to\r\nexamine them as soon as we had finished dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nBREAD-MAKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a wooden tub lying near the oyster heap, which I conjectured\r\nwas for holding water in which to open and separate the oysters in the\r\nexamination for pearls. I filled this tub at the stream and set it in\r\nthe shade of the willows. Then, with bared arms, and nostrils plugged\r\nwith leaves, I began the disgusting task of examining the oysters\r\ncarefully one by one. The second oyster I opened contained fifteen\r\nlittle seed pearls not much larger than a grain of mustard seed. Then I\r\ndrew blank after blank in the lottery, until I had opened perhaps fifty\r\nshells. Then a great prize came out in the shape of a beautiful\r\npear-shaped pearl of the size of a small hazel-nut, rainbow tinted and\r\nlustrous as a moon-lit cloud. Thus it went with varying fortune all the\r\nafternoon, until the heap was exhausted and I had collected two hundred\r\nand fifty seed pearls, ninety-seven small pearls, and a hundred and\r\nsixteen larger ones, some of them of great lustre and beauty. What the\r\nvalue of these pearls would prove to be I had no means of estimating,\r\nbut it doubtless would be considerable. I tied them carefully in my\r\nhandkerchief and put them in my pocket. The smell of the decayed\r\nshell-fish is something frightful to remember, and after I had finished\r\nand washed myself thoroughly in the stream it still seemed to cling to\r\nme and to permeate everything in the neighborhood. Why I had not noticed\r\nthis awful stench on my first visit was strange to me, and must have\r\nbeen due to the course of the wind at that time.\r\n\r\nWhen I had finished this loathsome task it was so late that I concluded\r\nto stay all night at the cove instead of trying to go home. If the\r\nweather kept clear there would be no great hardship in sleeping on the\r\ngrass for one night. The sun set, however, with an angry red glow amid a\r\nmass of heavy clouds portending foul weather. Moreover, as the night\r\nfell there was an oppressive calm, and the heat was intense. So\r\nthreatening was the aspect of the weather that had I been at all sure of\r\nbeing able to find my way in the darkness, I should have certainly\r\nattempted to get home even after the sun had set. There was no shelter\r\nif it should rain, and I was at my wits’ end how to contrive a place to\r\npass the night. What a fool I had been not to notice the approaching\r\nstorm in time to get to my comfortable house. The best provision I was\r\nable to make was to gather some grass and willow-boughs and take them\r\nunder an overhanging rock, where I cut with the axe in the dark some\r\nlimbs and boughs and made a sort of lean-to. This I supplemented with\r\nthe tub turned up toward the quarter whence the rain would most probably\r\ncome, and Duke and I crept into this sorry nest to await events.\r\n\r\nOne event came without waiting, and that was a powerful stench from the\r\nunlucky tub. But as I had endured this already for nearly half a day, I\r\nconcluded it would, by familiarity, become less and less offensive. I\r\ncould not go to sleep, but lay there turning and tossing on my\r\nuncomfortable couch and watching the weather.\r\n\r\nThe calm continued until near midnight, when a cool breeze sprang up and\r\nswept down the gorge and out to sea. I thought this indicated that the\r\nstorm was about to pass around and away; but the heavy rumble of\r\nthunder out at sea, growing louder and sharper, and becoming almost\r\ncontinuous, and the constant play of lightning, quickly dissipated this\r\nnotion. I looked out with awe at this tremendous electric display.\r\n\r\nThe breeze fell presently, and I looked out and saw coming in from the\r\nsea a coppery red mass of cloud glowing as though it contained a\r\nfurnace. Instinctively I crouched down behind the rock beside the dog,\r\nwho was shivering with fear, and grasped the corners of a huge fallen\r\nfragment. With a dreadful, screeching roar, mingled with a din of\r\nthunder such as I am utterly unable to describe, and can liken to\r\nnothing I ever heard before or since, the hurricane burst upon the\r\nisland. There was no rain, but at first I thought there was, for the\r\nspray from the ocean beat in my face and drenched me to the skin. It was\r\nnot rain, for it was salt to the taste. My shelter of boughs, and also\r\nthe high-smelling tub were blown away instantly, and with the dog under\r\nme I fairly had all I could do to hold on. Above the roar of the wind,\r\nthe rattling of stones, and the din of the thunder, I could hear the\r\ncrash of falling trees and breaking boughs. Nor did the awful wind let\r\nup for nearly half an hour, and I was quite worn out with the\r\napprehension and the struggle. If I lifted my face for an instant the\r\nspray and sand and pebbles whipped with such violence against it that I\r\nwas glad to bury it close to the ground. Such awful storms I had heard\r\nof, and even been witness to their effects after the event; but never\r\ncould I have had an adequate idea of the terrible reality without this\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nDuring the entire passage of the hurricane not a drop of rain fell, so\r\nfar as I could judge, though, as before stated, I was drenched with\r\nspray. Gradually, with an occasional renewal of the blast, the wind went\r\ndown, and in an hour the stars were shining pure and serene in the dark\r\nvault above.\r\n\r\nThe temperature had now fallen many degrees, and there was a cool,\r\nsteady wind from the north that chilled me through to the bone. Of\r\ncourse I had no fire, and no means of procuring one, and the only relief\r\nobtainable was such exercise as I could get by stamping about and\r\nthrashing my arms until the blood was in rapid circulation. Sitting back\r\nagainst the rock I dozed a little now and then, and waited impatiently\r\nfor the break of day, which seemed as though it never would come.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was fairly light we started for home. The effects of the\r\nhurricane were visible on every hand. Trees broken off, blown over, and\r\nuprooted, green branches scattered here and there, the silvery under\r\nsides of the leaves showing, and giving an air of disorder and\r\ndestruction by their unaccustomed appearance and tint, all marked the\r\nhand of the destroyer. The central plateau seemed to have suffered most.\r\nHere several great trees had been twisted until the trunks were a mass\r\nof splinters, indicating that they had successively occupied the very\r\neye and centre of the rotary wind. Hurrying along rapidly we came down\r\nto the lower land, and I was glad to observe much fewer signs of\r\ndestruction here. We came upon a dead pig, killed by a huge fallen limb,\r\nand I pulled him out, as we were now nearly home, and dragged him along\r\nwith me for food.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the open beach I found plenty of evidence of the mighty\r\nwind in the scattered palm leaves, boughs, and branches strewn along the\r\nstrand. In the distance I could see the ruins of my work-shed. The roof\r\nwas off, and lying down the beach a hundred yards or more in a heap at\r\nthe water’s edge. The boat, for which I felt specially anxious, was\r\nhidden from view by a clump of water bushes that grew on the hither\r\nbank of the creek. The mast I could see, and noted that an unnatural\r\ntilt had been given to it. Dragging the dead pig I slowly made my way\r\nalong the sand. The house stood intact, my hammock still swung to the\r\nframe-work of the shed. The top of a cocoanut palm, twisted off by the\r\nwind and carried through the air, had brought up against the frame of\r\nthe shed and lodged there, while the nuts growing on it were scattered\r\nabout the ground, some of them as far as the water’s edge.\r\n\r\nI went immediately to the boat and found it careened and sunk in the\r\nshallow water of the creek, the upper gunwale just above the surface. At\r\nthe house the only damage done was a hole in the northeast corner of the\r\nwall, caused by the end of a bough which had been driven through it and\r\nwas still sticking in the gap. The first thing I did was to build a\r\nrousing fire in the chimney; then hanging my damp clothing up in front\r\nof it to dry I went down for a bath in the creek, and to examine more\r\nminutely the boat. When she was righted up and baled out with a gourd I\r\nfound she had suffered no injury whatever, being as tight as a bottle.\r\nNor would she have sunk except for an extra amount of ballast that\r\nhappened to be on board, as the air-tight compartments held perfectly.\r\nBut the sinking was doubtless the best thing that could have happened.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I could dress and get something for breakfast, I cut up the\r\npig and put part of it in salt, and then turned to with a will upon the\r\nwork of repairing the shed. The larger part of the material of the roof\r\nwas uninjured, and as the weather fortunately remained clear, by the\r\nfollowing night I had the roof on again in good shape and much stronger\r\nthan before, as with the aid of the axe I was able to cut a great\r\nnumber of stout poles to add to the structure. When I had patched up the\r\nhole in the wall of my house and cleared away the litter, most of the\r\nsigns of the hurricane had disappeared from my neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe dampness of my house in wet weather, which was due to the walls\r\ngetting wet and soaking through with the driving rain, led me now to\r\nundertake a new task. The clay used in the building of the boat would, I\r\nthought, be sufficient in quantity to give the floor and the walls\r\ninside and out a good coat, and this when once dry would make the\r\nstructure like an adobe building. I intended, moreover, to add an extra\r\nthickness of thatch, put in a row of glass photograph plates toward the\r\nsea for windows, make a good cedar door, to be hung on wooden hinges,\r\nand add a wide veranda to the front, under which I might sit in the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nThe rain still came every day or two now, though evidently the dry\r\nseason was fast approaching. The weather was too uncertain to venture\r\nout any distance in the boat, and I therefore had plenty of time on my\r\nhands to attend to my building and other schemes for domestic comfort.\r\nAs planned, I daubed the whole house, inside and outside, with a good\r\nthick coat of the clay smoothed with the back of the shovel. On the\r\noutside, to give a workmanlike finish, I lined the soft clay into blocks\r\nand pointed the joints neatly. Then, with dry, pulverized clay and sand,\r\nwhich I sprinkled with water, trampled with the feet and smoothed by\r\nbeating with the shovel, I produced a hard, smooth floor like that under\r\nthe shed. All around the edge of this floor I fitted a single row of\r\nclam shells, and inside of this a second row of pink-mouthed tiger\r\nshells, which formed a handsome border. I put in a narrow horizontal\r\nwindow, of six panes side by side, at each side of the doorway, and\r\nconstructed a good door of split cedar, pinned together and hung on\r\nwooden hinges to swing outward, and provided it with a latch. I then\r\ndoubled the thatch all over the house and put up a light porch in front\r\nthatched with palm leaves, and built a floor for it the same as in the\r\nhouse. At one end of this porch I constructed a little low shed with\r\nwalls and roof for the dog.\r\n\r\nAs there was still a great quantity of clay left I built an oven near\r\nthe house, as follows: upon a raised platform of poles erected about\r\nthree feet above the ground, and about three by four feet in extent, I\r\nput a layer of sand and clay about four inches thick. This was the floor\r\nof the oven. All around this floor I laid a wall of adobe bricks, made\r\nof sand and clay partly dried. I then filled the interior with sand\r\nheaped up in the form of an arch, and laid the adobe bricks over it,\r\ndaubing and plastering all the cracks. At the rear was a small clay\r\nchimney, and at the front an opening for a doorway. When the clay had\r\nwell set and partly hardened, I raked out the sand through the doorway\r\nand left the hollow clay structure standing. I then constructed an adobe\r\nslab with which to close the doorway. In this oven I built a hot fire of\r\ndry wood and kept it going all day, by which means the clay was partly\r\nburned and the construction made entirely proof against the\r\nwet,--though, for that matter, the adobe would have stood without such\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nTo utilize the heat left in the walls from the burning I had put a pot\r\nfull of beans on to boil, with a good chunk of salt pork. At night I put\r\nthe beans and pork in an earthen dish and set them in the oven, which\r\nwas still hot, and closed it up tight, covering the chimney and luting\r\nthe door slab with wet clay. In the morning, when I opened it, there\r\ngushed out a delicious vapor, and the dish of beans and pork, brown and\r\ncrisp came forth hot and fit for a king.\r\n\r\nOne article I needed very badly was soap. I had tried to wash my\r\nclothing several times, but it was quite filthy notwithstanding these\r\nattempts. My entire wardrobe consisted of a heavy woollen shirt, a pair\r\nof tough moleskin pantaloons, a home-made hat, and a stout pair of\r\nshoes. Socks I had none, as the single pair I brought on shore were\r\nentirely worn out. Latterly I had made a practice of going barefoot,\r\nexcept on extended excursions through the jungle and over the rocks.\r\nWith plenty of wood ashes and pig fat at hand why should I not make\r\nsoap? I rigged up a leaching apparatus thus: in the bottom of a huge\r\ngourd I pierced several holes, and laid over them a layer of grass so\r\nthat the ashes would not stop them up; then I filled the gourd with\r\nalternate layers of grass and ashes to the top, and poured in fresh\r\nwater as long as it would absorb any. In a little while the lye began to\r\ndrip out of the holes into a vessel placed beneath to receive it. By\r\nchanging and renewing the ashes several times I finally collected a\r\nkettle full of the lye. This I placed over the fire and boiled until it\r\nhad lost two thirds of its volume. Then I put into the boiling lye\r\nstrips and pieces of fat pork until it would dissolve no more, keeping\r\nup the boiling slowly all the time. The result was a good article of\r\nlight colored soap of a jelly-like consistency. Its use both upon my\r\nclothing and myself was a luxury indeed.\r\n\r\nOne day I burned some lime and mixed a whitewash, which with a\r\ncocoa-husk swab I applied to the interior walls of the house, changing\r\nthem to a dazzling white and rendering the whole interior light and\r\ncheerful; which was a great comfort on dark days when I was confined\r\nthere. Moreover, it gave the place an air of wholesomeness and neatness\r\nthat was very home-like. As a further improvement I made a bed of soil\r\nat each end of the porch and transplanted some flowering vines and\r\ncreepers of several varieties; I also made a half-dozen hills in front\r\nof the house, carrying and filling in these spots a quantity of rich\r\nmuck, and planted sweet potatoes that they might spread their vines over\r\nthe sand. The garden which I had made before the rains set in was now in\r\nthriving condition, all the peas and beans being up and the potato-vines\r\nin blossom.\r\n\r\nMy diet was now varied and healthful enough; but I lacked one article of\r\nfood that I longed for and felt the need of more and more every\r\nday,--and that was bread, the staff of life. Parched-seed gruel was a\r\nvery poor substitute indeed, and at last I got so hungry for a taste of\r\nbread that I determined to make some out of the Indian corn.\r\n\r\nSo one day I made a basket and started across the island to bring home a\r\nsupply of the corn. All the way over I kept a good lookout for a\r\nsuitable gritty stone, that could be used to grind the corn, and found\r\nseveral that I thought might answer the purpose fairly well; but one\r\nsample--being a slab of grit-stone having a rough, pocked surface with\r\nsmall hard bits of chalcedony interspersed throughout--was so superior\r\nin quality to all the rest that I concluded I could do no better if I\r\nsought the island over. This slab, which was quite as much as I could\r\ncarry, I laid against a tree where I could easily find it, and went on\r\nmy way to “Farm Cove.” I had not been here since the great storm, and\r\nwas surprised to see how quickly and fully all traces of the hurricane\r\nhad disappeared. The corn was all right, the husks had fully dried, and\r\nthe heap lying on the rocks had not suffered from the rains. I filled my\r\nbasket,--a good bushel,--and immediately came home, returning forthwith\r\nfor the slab of grit-stone. Duke treed another raccoon, which we\r\ncaptured by cutting down the tree, and then with our plunder and the\r\nstone we managed to get home at nightfall.\r\n\r\nThe next day it began again to rain in intermittent showers; raining and\r\nshining alternately, as in the April weather of northern latitudes.\r\nAfter building a fire and heating up the oven and putting in the raccoon\r\nto bake, with some yams for dinner, I went to work on my stone slab.\r\nFirst I broke off a good piece the full width of the slab in length, and\r\nabout six inches in width to use as a grinder. With the back of the axe\r\nI hammered and dressed this as smooth as I could. Then I went at the\r\nslab itself, pounding it with the axe and breaking it at the edges until\r\nit was formed into a reasonably smooth, rectangular shape two feet long\r\nby one foot in width. I now sprinkled the face of the slab with wet sand\r\nand water, and placing it in an inclined position, rubbed the grinder up\r\nand down upon it, feeding on fresh sand and water from time to time, as\r\nit lost its cutting properties.\r\n\r\nThis was slow, hard, tedious work, and the progress made was so gradual\r\nthat it called for all my will to keep at it. Perseverance, however,\r\nwill finally conquer most obstacles, and this was a mere question of\r\nmuscle and will-power struggling against a hard grit-stone. The stone\r\nwas fated finally to yield; but it took me two days of hard work to get\r\nit into the right shape. All this for a piece of corn bread, and the\r\nbread not yet forthcoming.\r\n\r\nWhen finished the slab had a smooth, gritty surface slightly incurved\r\nfrom end to end, and the grinder designed to lie across it had its\r\ncorners rounded smoothly off.\r\n\r\nI set to work now to grind my corn as follows: The slab was propped up\r\nat a slight angle on a piece of canvas; on this slab the corn, a handful\r\nat a time, was sprinkled and then ground by rubbing the grinder up and\r\ndown over it. As it became pulverized the meal would gradually drift\r\ndown on to the canvas, the coarser particles rolling away to the edge of\r\nthe heap, only to be scraped up and ground over again. This was, as you\r\nmay imagine, tedious work. When I had accumulated about four quarts of\r\nmeal, I felt that I had enough of grinding for once.\r\n\r\nNow commenced the first act of bread-making proper. In a gourd I mixed\r\nabout a pint of the meal with warm water and a little salt, and set it\r\nin a warm place over night, that it might have a chance to ferment. This\r\nwas to be my yeast. In the morning the contents of the gourd were in a\r\nstate of incipient fermentation, and I went out and fired up the oven to\r\nbe ready for the grand final act. While the oven was heating I mixed up\r\nthe rest of the meal with salt and water, and added the fermented meal\r\nto it, mixing the whole to a consistency such that it could readily be\r\nstirred. This I set near the fire in an earthen pan, and watched it from\r\ntime to time. In about two hours it began to rise slightly, and the oven\r\nbeing fully ready I clapped the pan in and closed it up to bake. In an\r\nhour I opened the oven and took out a fragrant panful of nicely browned,\r\nlight, and crumbling corn bread, as a reward for all my labors. Perhaps\r\nit was not so good as a skilled bread-maker might have produced, but it\r\nwas sweet and delightful to me, and well repaid all my trouble, and both\r\nDuke and I rejoiced over it with our broiled bacon.\r\n\r\nAfter this experiment bread-making was a regular thing. Sometimes I\r\nsimply stirred up the raw meal with a little salt and water and baked it\r\non the back of a shovel before the open fire,--hoe-cake fashion,--to be\r\neaten brown and hot; but I generally made raised bread by the process\r\nwhich I have described, sometimes adding a modicum of pork fat for\r\nshortening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE GALLEON FOUND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe severe rains gradually ceased, until sunshine was the rule and rain\r\nthe exception. I did not expect a season of absolute dryness, for in\r\nthis locality rain prevails to some extent throughout the whole year, so\r\nthat the vegetation rarely suffers from drought.\r\n\r\nOne morning, the sky being clear and a gentle breeze blowing from the\r\nsouthwest, Duke and I went aboard the boat,--which by the way, I had\r\nnamed the “Mohawk”--and started for a trial of the water-glass. We were\r\nsoon on the ground, a mile to the north of the cape. Lowering the sails\r\nI put the glass over the side, with very little hope of success as the\r\nwater seemed to have a cloudy appearance. It proved to be in such a\r\ncondition that I could not see the bottom at all. I then put up the sail\r\nand ran in nearer the shore to where the depth was about thirty feet.\r\nHere I could see the sand and rocks and shells on the bottom very\r\ndistinctly, and noted that there were streaks and veins of the murky\r\nwater running through the more transparent portion.\r\n\r\nFinding that nothing could be done in the way of investigation until the\r\nwater became clearer, I stood out to the west until by a single tack I\r\ncould make Farm Cove, intending to bring back a cargo of corn and some\r\nyams and potatoes. I found a few bushels of yams still in good\r\ncondition, and noted with pleasure that many of the potatoes left in the\r\nground had sprouted and the vines had already acquired quite a growth.\r\nWith spade and shovel I turned to heartily, and cleared away the\r\nluxuriant growth of weeds which threatened to choke this volunteer crop.\r\nThen I loaded in my corn and started back, reaching home in time for\r\nsupper.\r\n\r\nThe next two days I devoted to planting a patch of corn, hardly\r\nexpecting to remain long enough upon the island to enjoy it, but\r\nthinking it wise to provide for an uncertain future. On the third day I\r\nwent out again to try the water-glass, but the water was still lacking\r\nin transparency and there was nothing to do except to wait.\r\n\r\nBut while returning I thought of a thing that would be very useful to me\r\nin future expeditions, and that was to set up on the northern cape\r\nsomething which might serve as a guide to me in future operations. I had\r\nno compass and was obliged to guess the direction blindly by the sun.\r\nNow the Spanish admiral, when he reported that the galleon bore east of\r\nnorth from the point of rocks, and about a mile therefrom, probably\r\nspoke, as to direction at least, from actual observation of the compass,\r\nas a sailor would; for nobody knows better than a sailor the\r\nimpossibility of guessing at direction without a guide. Indeed, the\r\nsailor, when he comes on deck, turns instinctively to the compass to\r\norient himself and correct his sense of direction, because the course of\r\nthe vessel may have changed half a dozen times during a watch below,\r\nwithout his knowledge. To one on board a vessel the parts fore and aft,\r\nstarboard and port, below and aloft, have a fixed relation to each\r\nother, and one is apt to get a set impression as to direction from this\r\nfixed relation of familiar objects. Thus I have heard of an old\r\nsailing-master who was on board the same vessel for twenty years, and\r\nwho declared that, no matter where the ship might be or upon what\r\ncourse, it always seemed to him that the head of his bunk lay to the\r\nnorth; that when at sea the most distressing thing to him was that the\r\nsun never rose in the same quarter two mornings in succession; and that\r\nit never rose in the east except on Long Island, where he was born.\r\n\r\nAs to the accuracy of the estimated distance--one mile--that, to be\r\nsure, was a much more uncertain quantity; though officers of war vessels\r\nare, and were then, well trained to estimate distances on the water, as\r\notherwise they could not determine the range of their cannon and arms.\r\nAltogether I had every reason to suppose, barring variations in the\r\ncompass and individual errors, that the location assigned was reasonably\r\naccurate. At any rate I decided to start my investigation with the\r\nassumption that the assigned location was accurate, and to work from the\r\ndesignated point as a centre; it would then be easy, as I proceeded, to\r\nallow for error in all directions without the chance of multiplying it\r\nin any particular direction.\r\n\r\nIn my little box of drawing-tools was a small brass protractor--a\r\nsemi-circle divided into one hundred and eighty degrees, with\r\nhalf-degree marks. This would be convenient in the work I was about to\r\ndo, though not absolutely necessary, as in its absence I could have\r\neasily constructed one that would answer my purpose. The first thing to\r\ndo was to establish a true north and south line. That night the stars\r\nshone brightly, and I easily found the pole star by the pointers in the\r\nGreat Bear, or “Dipper.” In the sand at the north cape I drove an\r\nupright stake made of a stout cane. Then taking another straight piece I\r\nplaced it in a notch on top of the upright and sighted along its length\r\nadjusting it until it pointed straight at the north star. To secure it\r\nin this position I drove a short notched stake at the butt of the\r\ninclined cane and tied the cane firmly to both. I was now sure that the\r\ntwo uprights were in a true north and south direction from each other,\r\nand the work for that night was finished, as the remainder could be\r\nbetter done by daylight.\r\n\r\nThe next thing I wanted was a standard of measurement; unfortunately my\r\ndrawing instruments did not contain the usual ivory rule. But this did\r\nnot occasion me much uneasiness, as I hoped to be able to deduce the\r\nstandard inch by a comparison of my belongings. If I once got the true\r\ninch it would be easy to get from that the foot, the yard, the rod, the\r\nmile. I had my photograph plates as one guide; these I had every reason\r\nto suppose were cut quite accurately to the dimensions of five inches by\r\nseven. Then there was the brass protractor. It is true there were no\r\ninches marked on this; but the workman who made it would naturally\r\nfollow some standard, and the chances were very great that the diameter\r\nof this instrument would be found to be an exact multiple of the inch,\r\nand as I conjectured, exactly four inches. To test this matter I laid\r\nthe protractor on the short side of one of the plates, and taking the\r\ndifference between the two found, as I had expected, that this\r\ndifference was one fifth of the width of the plate, and one seventh of\r\nits length. This proved satisfactorily to my mind that the plate was\r\naccurate in dimensions, that is to say, five by seven inches, and that\r\nthe difference between the length of the straight side of the protractor\r\nand the width of the plate was the standard inch. From this\r\nstarting-point I constructed a foot measure, and cut me a light pole\r\nexactly a rod in length.\r\n\r\nReturning now to the cape where my north and south direction rod was\r\nfixed, I proceeded to set a peg, which to avoid confusion we will\r\ndesignate as A, in the sand in a prolongation of the line, and with the\r\nprotractor got the true east by north, marking this line by a second\r\npeg. Then I turned about and marked a line which made an angle of one\r\nhundred and twenty degrees with the east by north line, and which would\r\nlead down the beach.\r\n\r\nI now proceeded to plant in the sand three poles about fifteen feet in\r\nheight: one at the central point A, one in a prolongation of the east by\r\nnorth line, which pole we will call B, and the third in a prolongation\r\nof the angle line down the beach, which latter pole we will call C. The\r\nnext thing was the measurement of a base line from the pole A, through C\r\ndown the beach for a mile. This I did as accurately as I could with my\r\nrod measure; but it was a sort of work highly conducive, as you may\r\nimagine, to the backache, especially as I went over it three times to\r\neliminate as much error as possible, taking the average of the three\r\nmeasurements. Nor was the third measurement completed much before it was\r\ntime to go home.\r\n\r\nOnly one thing now remained to be done, and this I did the next morning.\r\nAt the end of the mile line on the beach I erected a tall pole, which we\r\nwill call D, and from it as a centre laid off a line thirty degrees from\r\nthe base to intersect the east-by-north line or its prolongation, and\r\nmarked the direction by a second tall pole which we will call E. Now,\r\naccording to a simple problem in trigonometry, it will be seen that if I\r\nshould sail out in my boat east of north from the cape, guiding myself\r\nby the two poles A and B, when I had brought the poles D and E into line\r\nhaving A and B in line at the same time, I should be a mile away from A\r\nin a true east-of-north direction.\r\n\r\nAlthough I now went out every day to try the water, it did not grow\r\nclear. Finding the guide-poles barely visible, especially the more\r\ndistant pair, I mounted a gourd on the top of each one, after which I\r\nhad no further difficulty in seeing them. As it was some little trouble\r\nto take the bearings constantly, I rigged a buoy and anchored it at the\r\nspot where theoretically the galleon lay. I found the water about sixty\r\nfeet deep; and the buoy--a large gourd attached to a line with a stone\r\nfor an anchor--floated easily on the swell, with eighty feet of line.\r\nAfter this buoy was anchored I took down the guide-poles, marking their\r\nplaces with pegs, in case I should require to use them again. This I did\r\nout of a superabundance of caution, not that I believed any one else\r\nthan myself--had there been any one else--could have read the riddle\r\nthey told to me.\r\n\r\nEvery day for three weeks I went out to the shoal near the buoy and\r\nexamined the water. It was getting gradually clearer; but had it not\r\nbeen for my recollection of the first visit made, before I had the\r\nwater-glass, and of the appearance of the water at that time, I should\r\nhave doubtless given up the attempt in despair. The remembrance,\r\nhowever, of the clear water, and the gleam through it of yellow sand,\r\nwas not to be forgotten, and it kept up my hopes to the last.\r\n\r\nThe weather grew oppressively hot, and there came on one day a terrific\r\nthunder-storm followed by a gale of wind from the northeast which lasted\r\ntwo days and was followed in turn by fair weather, with a gentle\r\nsouthwest wind. When I went out again I found the water quite clear. I\r\nwas very impatient to test the glass, so much so that I would not wait\r\nto make any trials until I had reached the neighborhood of the buoy.\r\nHere I lowered the sails and put the glass over.\r\n\r\nI could see the bottom quite plainly. It was of clean sand and strewed\r\nwith shells. Here and there was a fragment of sea-weed, sponge, or other\r\nocean growth. A shoal of silver-sided mackerel dashed by, and numerous\r\nstrange fishes came into view. One sort there was with long streamers\r\nextending from the tail, and a body banded with rainbow hues. I looked\r\nlong and intently at the strange panorama unfolded to my view, and found\r\nwhen I raised my head that the boat had drifted half a mile to the\r\nnortheast of the buoy. Then I hoisted the sail and ratched back beyond\r\nthe buoy, and drifted again, with the glass over the side, watching the\r\nbottom for signs of the galleon. This manoeuvre I repeated as long as\r\nthere was light enough to see. I found that I could not see the bottom\r\nafter four in the afternoon, nor before nine in the morning.\r\n\r\nI spent three days at this work without any success, and then found that\r\nI was going at times over ground that I had already searched, for I\r\nbegan to identify objects as having been already seen. Especially did I\r\nrecognize a huge conch-shell with a clam-shell wedged in the mouth. It\r\nwas necessary therefore to devise some systematic method of search, or I\r\nshould simply be hunting over and over the same ground. So I adopted the\r\nplan of gridironing, so to speak, a territory of a mile square, after\r\nthe following fashion: I made me an extra buoy and anchored it at an\r\narbitrary point about a half-mile south of the centre buoy. Taking this\r\nas a starting-point I drifted a mile before the wind to the northeast;\r\nthen ratching back to the starting-point I lifted the buoy and carried\r\nit a hundred feet to the northwest, and drifted again down another\r\nparallel line, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe wind held steadily in the southwest, fortunately, day after day, and\r\nafter a week’s hard work I came nearly on a line with the central buoy;\r\nbut no signs of a wreck, or even a mound where one might be buried in\r\nthe sand. On the eighth day of this systematic search the weather seemed\r\nabout to change. A huge bank of clouds lay low in the southwest, and I\r\nhardly knew whether to venture out or not. But as it would in all\r\nprobability take some hours for the storm to brew, I set forth and made\r\none drift with my usual success, then returned and started for the\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nWhen I was about half-way down on the second drift I found the wreck.\r\nThere was no doubt about it. The hulk lay there very slightly buried in\r\nthe sand, a great, black mass careened a little to port, and the bows\r\nsomewhat higher than the stern. Strange to say, it was not further than\r\ntwenty rods from my central marking buoy, and about due north from it. I\r\nimmediately dropped overboard my reserve buoy, composed of four large\r\ngourds attached to a strong line, and having a hundred-pound rock for an\r\nanchor, and watched to see that the anchoring-stone dropped just beside\r\nthe hull.\r\n\r\nAt last I had found it! Here beneath me in sixty feet of water lay the\r\nSpanish galleon, exactly where the admiral so long ago had reported her\r\nto have sunk. His report being so far verified, it would also prove true\r\nin respect to the treasure contained within her ancient ribs.\r\n\r\nA darkening of the sea and sky warned me that there was no time to waste\r\nin dreaming over my discovery. The storm which had been coming would now\r\nsoon be here. I therefore hoisted sail and turned my back on the\r\ngalleon. It was none too soon. Indeed, before I made the creek the wind\r\nhad risen to such a height that I had to lower the sails and double reef\r\nthem, and then went into the creek gunwale under, with the white spume\r\nand froth flying clear over the boat. But a miss is as good as a mile.\r\nI got safely in and cooked me a noble dinner of corn bread and baked\r\npork and beans in honor of the day’s glorious event.\r\n\r\nDuke and I sat in the open porch that afternoon, sheltered from the wind\r\nand rain, resting contentedly after the long strain of hard work which\r\nhad kept me on the keen jump every day from dawn until dark since the\r\nsearch began. The wind blew strongly, with occasional gusts of driving\r\nrain, and I feared the storm might shift my buoys, or tear them loose\r\nand carry them away; but I could locate the central buoy again by the\r\nsights already taken, if it should go, and from that the spot could\r\neasily be found. But I hoped for better results, as the main buoy, which\r\nmarked the wreck, had plenty of line, and moreover, was strong and\r\nbuoyant. I wished this one might last, for with the anchor lying close\r\nbeside the sunken hull, it seemed to me a sort of claim stake. I\r\ndetermined, as soon as the weather would permit, to rig a buoy which\r\nwould outride the storms, and anchor it securely over the wreck. As is\r\nusual with the heavier winds and gales in this locality, the wind before\r\nnightfall began to veer around to another quarter, getting before sunset\r\nquite around into the north, and by nine o’clock settling down in the\r\nnortheast, exactly the opposite quarter from its starting-point, with\r\nfine rain and mist.\r\n\r\nHaving located the galleon, I had now done all I had intended to do\r\nbefore leaving the island, except to mark the location more securely, if\r\nthat proved necessary; and I was therefore impatient to get away in my\r\nboat for Martinique or some other civilized port where I could get the\r\nnecessary assistance and diving-apparatus. Of course I must now wait for\r\nsettled weather and a favorable wind as I had once before had to do. But\r\nthis time I hoped most sincerely that I should not be kept waiting as\r\nlong as before, for with little to do the time would hang heavily on my\r\nhands. The bare thought of getting back once more to civilization made\r\nmy heart beat faster, and stirred my very soul.\r\n\r\nThe northerly wind was chill, and the air so moist that I built a\r\ncheerful fire in the chimney and drew my chair up in front of it, closed\r\nthe door, lighted a candle, and tried to read, Duke snoozing on the\r\nfloor at my feet in front of the hearth.\r\n\r\nBut although I sat thus until midnight, I could not read. I watched the\r\nembers fall and die away hour after hour, thinking over the days spent\r\non the island, the trials and the labor, the mistakes and the successes,\r\nand the strange outcome. That I should have actually found the galleon\r\nseemed now upon cool reflection little less than a miracle. That some of\r\nthe hundreds of professional wreckers and divers who make a regular\r\nbusiness of seeking out such things on the faintest clues should not\r\nhave run across the Spanish admiral’s report and sought and found the\r\nwreck and removed the treasure seemed a strange thing to me now. Why had\r\nnot the Spanish government done this long ago? Then the horrible idea\r\nentered my mind that perhaps they had already done so. Or if not,\r\nperhaps an expedition designed for that purpose might even now be on its\r\nway, and might arrive when I had left the island. If so, they would\r\nspeedily pick up my buoy, and I should return to find the treasure gone.\r\n\r\nAll these and a thousand such distempered fancies tortured me into a\r\nstate bordering on frenzy. To have the treasure almost in sight and yet\r\nto lose it would be too much for human nature to bear. I would remove my\r\nbuoy, erase every mark and take my chances of picking up the clue. But\r\nafter all, how foolish that would be. The treasure lies there safe, and\r\nhas lain there many, many years, and this frantic fear coming at so\r\nlate a day is the height of folly.\r\n\r\nThen my mind would wander away to plans for conducting my negotiations:\r\nhow I should seek out a man whom I could trust, and how I should present\r\nmatters to secure his aid and co-operation. How should I get the money?\r\nAh, there were the pearls! I would sell them and possibly raise money\r\nenough myself. But would I dare offer these pearls for sale? Would not\r\ntheir possession excite the cupidity of others and cause them to follow\r\nme back to the island and come upon me in the midst of the work of\r\nsecuring the treasure?\r\n\r\nAnd so my fancies came and went, until at last, overpowered by fatigue,\r\nI fell fast asleep in my chair, and was wakened an hour or two before\r\nbreak of day by Duke’s cold nose against my hand. Whereupon I sensibly\r\nwent to bed and to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE CASTAWAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was now the month of May and I had been about nine months a prisoner\r\non the island. If all went as well as I hoped, I might be at home before\r\nthe end of a year with money enough to redeem the dear old farm.\r\n\r\nThe morning was gray and gloomy, the wind still driving gusts of rain\r\nfrom the northeast, and the breakers yellow with sand rolling in on the\r\nbeach, and dashing up fragments of weed and long streamers of bladder\r\nplant. There was a strong salt smell in the nostrils that such weather\r\nbrings on the seashore; the gray, leaden clouds hung low and heavy over\r\na dark, indigo sea, whitened far and near with foaming crests, like\r\nmanes of racing steeds; the foliage gleamed silvery gray as the leaves\r\nwere swept by the wind; and the willows along the creek bent until they\r\ndipped their slender branches in the stream. Occasionally a parrot or\r\nother long-tailed bird could be seen tossed and buffeted in an attempt\r\nto fly from one tree to another, frequently giving up the struggle and\r\nfairly drifting away to be lost among the foliage.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the wet, I went about getting stores into the boat and\r\npreparing for the voyage. I filled half a dozen two-gallon gourds with\r\nwater, and stopped them with well waxed wooden plugs, stowing them\r\ncarefully in the bottom of the boat with due regard to her trim. Then I\r\nput on board the remainder of the dried turtle-meat, and set a ham on\r\nthe fire to boil. I made two pans of bread, and put them, with pork,\r\nbeans, yams, and potatoes, in the oven to bake. This food would all keep\r\nwell. In addition I parched and ground up two or three quarts of seed\r\nfor cold gruel. Everything was stowed away, and the boat in readiness by\r\nthree o’clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThere was but little sign of an abatement or change in the weather. I\r\nfelt curious to know if my buoy still held, and as there was yet time\r\nbefore dark to go up to the north cape by way of the beach and return, I\r\ncalled Duke and started along the strand. About half-way there we came\r\nupon the carcass of a magnificent silver-sided tarpon,--a huge fish\r\nsomewhat like a sea-bass,--that would have weighed probably two hundred\r\npounds. It was dead when cast ashore, and so of course unfit for food. A\r\nflock of gulls were quarrelling and fighting over it, and as we\r\napproached they arose and filled the air in a great cloud. After we\r\npassed by they circled around, wind-buffeted, and settled again on their\r\nfood, covering the beach, and hovering in a seething, hungry, struggling\r\ncrowd about the fish, which must have been a rare feast for them.\r\n\r\nI picked up a beautiful and perfect specimen of the fragile shell of the\r\npearly nautilus, thin as paper, fluted and corrugated with lovely\r\nregularity, and tinted like the shaded petals of a blush rose. Rarely\r\nbeautiful, divinely perfect, this sample of nature’s handiwork, cast up\r\nby the foaming, angry breakers amid the brown tangle of the shore and\r\nthe foul-smelling ocean-weeds, seemed like a poem, a hymn in praise of\r\nnature’s God. I put the delicate and perfect structure carefully in my\r\nbosom to carry away as a memento of my island home.\r\n\r\nWe reached the cape, and I clambered up the highest rock from which I\r\ncould obtain a clear outlook, and found my buoy all right, rising and\r\nfalling with the swell, now submerged, and now reappearing, evidently\r\ntugging at its anchor-rope, and securely held thereby.\r\n\r\nI thought how peacefully slept the ancient hulk beneath all this\r\nturbulence. Undisturbed by wind or wave it lay there slowly changing its\r\ntough timbers of Andalusian oak back into the elements from which they\r\nsprang. I thought, too, of the indestructible gold that lay buried\r\nthere, waiting the fulness of time for its reappearance in the active\r\nlife of man; how long the years had been since it had felt the grip of\r\navarice or slid freely from the fingers of charity.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I saw away upon the rim of the sea in the northeast, in the\r\nvery eye of the wind, the white glint of a small sail. The mist, the\r\nwaves, and the changing rain hid it momently, and then it would gleam\r\nout again a white spark among the gray. I watched it intently for a\r\nquarter of an hour, and made out that it must be a small schooner-rigged\r\nboat hove to with jib and close reefed mainsail, drifting bodily before\r\nthe wind, and rolling in a frightful manner. The mainmast had been\r\nbroken off at the top, and on the foremast, half-masted, fluttered a red\r\nflag. I made out clearly, presently, that the craft was merely a\r\nhalf-decked boat similar to my own, though perhaps of somewhat larger\r\nsize, and I thought I could see somebody on board, but could not\r\ndistinguish clearly. But of course, if it was hove to, there would be\r\nsome one on board, as such a condition of the canvas would not be likely\r\nto occur by accident in a boat fortuitously adrift. If the wind held in\r\nthe present quarter, the boat was certain to drift on to the island, and\r\nthat too in a short time. It would not take above two hours and a half\r\nfor it to reach the breakers, unless it could run before the wind and\r\nthus make a course to avoid the island. Very soon indeed, the island\r\nwould be a lee shore, and an exceedingly dangerous one. I marvelled\r\ngreatly that they did not seem to see this danger.\r\n\r\nThere was but one thing I could do, and that was the preparation of\r\nbeacon-fires to guide them into the creek mouth, the only harbor on the\r\neast coast of the island. With this in view I hurried as fast as\r\npossible down the beach to the house, and laid two fires, one on each\r\nside of the creek mouth, heaping up the dry wood from my store in such a\r\nmanner that it would make a great blaze, and getting all in readiness to\r\nlight as soon as the sun went down. The wind was appreciably less, and I\r\nbelieved was gradually decreasing. Moreover, it had now stopped raining,\r\nand I could see the boat more distinctly.\r\n\r\nAn hour before sunset I thought it would be possible to go out with my\r\nown boat under double-reefed canvas, and intercept the stranger.\r\nSomething was undoubtedly wrong on board of her, otherwise she would not\r\nbe allowed thus to drift to leeward without control, with the island in\r\nplain sight. If there should prove to be no one on board, I might\r\npossibly be able to save the boat, which could hardly fail to prove\r\nbetter than my own. On the other hand, should there be some one on\r\nboard, I might render valuable assistance. I determined forthwith to\r\nmake the attempt. So I lighted my fires and got on board.\r\n\r\nIt was no easy matter to run my boat out over the bar in the teeth of a\r\nhalf-gale of wind; and I did not accomplish it without getting\r\ncompletely wet through, as I was obliged to tail on behind and push her\r\nout through the breakers until I was immersed to my neck in salt water,\r\nand then clamber in over the stern and haul aft the main sheet with the\r\nsail flapping and thundering as though determined to burst loose.\r\nHowever, I soon got her under control and was gliding along close\r\nhauled on the starboard tack, with the spray, as she pitched nose down,\r\nflying as high as the gaff, and raining down on the deck in bucketfuls.\r\n\r\nThe sun was about an hour high as I left the creek, and the strange boat\r\nin plain sight about a mile and a half dead to windward. I could easily\r\nget to windward of her in a single tack, by standing well off shore on\r\nthe first slant.\r\n\r\nWhen I came up near enough to hail I did so, and got no response.\r\nGetting to windward I wore and ran down quite to the boat, and letting\r\nboth sheets go, loosened the halliards and lowered the mainsail, and\r\nbrought my own boat close up along side. For the moment my own sail hid\r\nthe vessel and I could not see what was before me. But now I looked and\r\nsaw lying in the stern sheets what seemed to be the corpse of an old,\r\ngray-haired man of perhaps seventy years, the head held by a girl of\r\neighteen or thereabouts.\r\n\r\nI never shall forget the look that was on her face. Pale, drawn, with\r\ndishevelled hair, and dark circles around her beautiful eyes, she gazed\r\nat me without a word.\r\n\r\n“Do you know,” cried I, “that you are drifting on to the beach and will\r\nbe among the breakers in half an hour?”\r\n\r\nFor answer she pointed to her dry lips.\r\n\r\n“Is it water you want?”\r\n\r\nShe nodded. I hastily cast a line on board and lashed the two vessels\r\ntogether, where grinding they rose and fell with the waves, and then\r\nseizing a gourd of water made my way to the girl. She would not drink\r\nherself until after I had poured some water into the mouth of the old\r\nman, who though perfectly helpless was still alive, and swallowed the\r\nwater as fast as I gave it to him. Then I held the mouth of the heavy\r\ngourd to her own lips until I thought she had drunk enough. She gripped\r\nit with both hands, and I had to force it away from her. It was a\r\npitiful sight.\r\n\r\nBut there was no time to lose, for we were fast drifting into the\r\nbreakers, and it was absolutely necessary to get the boats before the\r\nwind and get steerage way on, or we should be on shore and dashed to\r\npieces by the rollers. I sprang forward and loosened the main sheet of\r\nthe strange boat, unlashed the helm which was tied amidships, and she\r\npaid off at once handsomely.\r\n\r\nThe sun was now quite down, but my two beacon-fires burned brightly, and\r\nI steered straight for them. Finding my own boat alongside had a\r\ntendency to bring us around to the wind, I put the helm into the girl’s\r\nhand and bade her hold it just so, and jumping on to my own boat lowered\r\nthe jib, that was still set, cast off the lashing, and hitching a line\r\nforward made her fast to tow. I then hauled up and got on board the\r\nother boat again, and let my own boat drop behind us. Now I found no\r\ndifficulty in steering, though my own boat would yaw and pull a little,\r\nfirst one way and then the other.\r\n\r\nWe were soon close to the bar, and I felt no little apprehension as to\r\nwhat might happen when we actually encountered the huge roller which\r\nbroke every few moments there. But there was no help for it; we must\r\ntake our chances, one of which--and not the least probable--was that the\r\nfirst boat might ground and the one in tow come crashing in on top of\r\nus. Fortunately,--for it was pure good-luck,--we struck a roller just at\r\nthe right moment which lifted us over the bar as it broke. The tow-line\r\nsnapped in twain as we were on the crest, and my own boat shot alongside\r\nlike a waterfowl and passed us, both boats riding into the creek\r\nalongside of each other, the red glare of the beacon-fires at either\r\nhand lighting up the scene like the last act of a sensational drama.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we were fairly in the creek I jumped overboard, the water not\r\nbeing above my chest, and beached both the boats safely. The girl still\r\nsat holding the old man’s head, and had not spoken a word. But she\r\nfollowed my motions with her eyes, and I could easily read therein that\r\nshe was grateful enough for my exertions, and appreciated the danger we\r\nhad escaped.\r\n\r\nThe old man could apparently neither speak nor move. An ashen pallor lay\r\non his countenance, and one side of his face, especially one corner of\r\nhis mouth, was drawn down and distorted,--a sufficient indication, had I\r\nunderstood it, that he was suffering from a stroke of paralysis. From\r\nhis clothing, which was soaked with spray, I could easily see that he\r\nwas a clergyman.\r\n\r\nI helped the girl out, partly carrying her as she could scarcely stand,\r\nand then attempted to lift out the old man. He was a heavy, strongly\r\nbuilt man, weighing all of two hundred and fifty pounds. A heavy,\r\nhelpless man is about as awkward a burden as one can imagine. Limp and\r\nyielding he could not be picked up except by the middle, and he was so\r\nlying in the boat that it was impossible for me to get a good hold of\r\nhim in such position as to exert my strength. His clothing, all soaked\r\nwith rain and salt water, clung to him, and must have chilled his poor\r\nhelpless body through. If he was to live at all it was absolutely\r\nnecessary to get him warm and dry right speedily.\r\n\r\nMeantime the poor girl stood shivering in her equally wet garments,\r\nlooking on anxiously at my efforts. Finally she spoke: “I think if you\r\nwill turn him across the boat, you may be able to lift his head and\r\nshoulders up here,”--placing her hand on the gunwale. “Have courage,\r\ndear father, he will be gentle with you.”\r\n\r\nA wan flicker, somewhat like the wrecked ghost of a smile, seemed to\r\npass over the old man’s distorted face at the words of the girl, the\r\nfirst I had heard her utter. It was idle to expect any help from her, as\r\nshe could scarcely stand, and was in fact partly supporting herself with\r\nher hands on the boat. Following the daughter’s suggestion, I moved her\r\nfather around until he lay thwartships, and then placing my feet on the\r\ngunwale and seizing him under the arms pulled him bodily up until his\r\nhead and shoulders were out of the boat. Then jumping overboard I\r\nmanaged to get him fairly on my back, his back to my own with my two\r\nhands under his armpits. Though I accounted myself pretty strong, and\r\nthe hardy life on the island had by no means diminished my muscular\r\npower, this lift was the very limit of my strength. With bare feet\r\nfairly gripping the yielding sand, and the water above my knees, I\r\nmanaged to stagger through it to the shore and up to the work-shed,\r\nwhere I sank on my knees and lowered him to the ground. The girl\r\nfollowed us. I turned to her as soon as my breath came, and said, “Go\r\nand stand by the fire, you are chilled almost to death. I shall be able\r\nto get your father into the house and into a warm, dry bed, where I can\r\nchange these wet clothes.”\r\n\r\n“I can be of some help, can I not?” said she with a piteous look. “Oh,\r\nsir, be careful and gentle with him, I beseech you.”\r\n\r\n“No, I can manage better alone, and you need to warm yourself,” said I,\r\nand without waiting longer I stooped to the old man again, and now with\r\nmuch greater ease managed, by putting my arms around him, to lift him\r\nand carry him to the house, where I laid him down on the floor, and\r\nimmediately went to the beacon-fire near which the girl was seated. I\r\nsecured two half-burned pieces of wood, and returning to the house\r\nbuilt a rousing good fire in the chimney, and lighted a candle. Then as\r\nrapidly as I could do so I stripped off his clothes and rolled him in a\r\ndry blanket on a couch of grass.\r\n\r\n“Are you more comfortable now?”\r\n\r\nFor answer came the abortive flicker, as of a throttled smile, and he\r\nclosed and opened his eyes once or twice as though assenting.\r\n\r\n“Can’t you speak at all?”\r\n\r\nA sort of struggle seemed to come over his face; then he closed his eyes\r\nand held them shut for a moment. It then dawned upon me that the man was\r\nsuffering from a paralytic stroke. Up to this time, without giving the\r\nmatter any particular attention, I had thought that perhaps he was\r\nmerely suffering from chill and exhaustion, and several times during my\r\ntremendous struggle with his weight it had been on my tongue to urge him\r\nto exert himself for his own sake. Now the awful nature of his\r\ncondition, his utter helplessness, the mental torture he must have\r\nendured and be yet enduring, came upon me and must have shown itself in\r\nmy face; for as he looked at me he closed his eyes again in the same\r\nmanner as before. There he lay swathed in the blanket, his intelligence\r\nintact, perfectly able to see all that went on around him, and to\r\nrealize his situation and condition, doubtless also fully alive, so far\r\nas sensation went, to every pain and discomfort, and yet utterly unable\r\nto stir hand or foot or speak a word. Even distorted as his face was,\r\nthere was the stamp of a noble, generous nature upon it, and a venerable\r\nbenevolence yet shone forth from every feature. What a terrible fate was\r\nthis. I was moved to deepest pity by the contemplation of it.\r\n\r\nI placed my hand upon his forehead and said gently, “Be assured and\r\nrest easy now. I will go and bring your daughter here and see that she\r\nis made comfortable. Here are food and shelter for you both, and you are\r\nmost heartily welcome to it and to my best assistance.”\r\n\r\nI found the daughter sitting on the sand before the fire, her wet\r\ngarments already steaming from the heat. I told her that her father was\r\nas comfortable as it was possible to make him, and that she had better\r\ngo to him and see if she could not get off some of her wet garments. In\r\nthe mean time I would get some food warm for them both.\r\n\r\n“For pity’s sake,” said she in a tremulous and vibrant voice, “let me\r\nhave some water. We have been three days without water except what you\r\ngave us.”\r\n\r\nWithout waiting to reproach myself for not doing sooner what I should\r\nhave known from personal experience was the thing to do, I ran to my\r\nboat and got a gourd full and held it for her to drink. I then went with\r\nher to the house and gave the old man a long drink.\r\n\r\nThe girl then said to me that on board there was a trunk containing her\r\nclothing, and that she would be glad if she could have it; that as there\r\nwere several chests and trunks stowed under the deck forward, I would\r\nknow hers by such and such marks and peculiarities. I went down and got\r\nthe trunk, and moreover took out a chest and another trunk, which I put\r\nunder the work-shed, bringing her trunk up to the house. I had afterward\r\nto be again called to get it open for her, as the key could not be\r\nturned by her slender fingers.\r\n\r\nGetting out of my boat a pan of baked pork and beans, I proceeded to\r\nextemporize a hot soup by mashing up some of the beans and adding half\r\nof a pepperpod and some water, and setting the preparation on the fire\r\nto come to a boil. This made a good hot porridge soup, and did not take\r\nlong in preparation. When it was ready I went up to the house with the\r\nkettle and knocked at the door; it was opened by the girl, her dress\r\nchanged for a dry one and much of the distress seemingly gone from her\r\npale, beautiful face.\r\n\r\n“Here,” said I, “is some hot bean porridge for your father and you; and\r\nhere are a couple of cocoanut-shells from which to eat it. I will take\r\nsome for myself down at the shed.”\r\n\r\n“But,” replied she, “we cannot drive you out of your house, sir; why do\r\nyou not come here and eat with us?”\r\n\r\n“Very well, if you like,” said I. “There will be some corn-bread also\r\nand plenty of water to drink.”\r\n\r\nWe ate heartily of the soup and bread, the old man taking only the soup.\r\n\r\nI then brought up my hammock and swung it as low down as possible for\r\nthe girl, and took back the mainsail, that had once formed a tent at\r\nFarm Cove, to use for my own bed at the shed. I explained as well as I\r\ncould how she should sleep in the hammock, and gave her one of the\r\nblankets. She assured me she had often slept in a hammock and thought\r\nshe could manage it. She was then about to explain how she and her\r\nfather came to be adrift in the boat; but I stopped her by saying, “No,\r\nlet us wait until to-morrow. You are both exhausted and need sleep and\r\nrest. You shall tell me all about it in the morning.” And then I wished\r\nthem both good-night.\r\n\r\n“Good-night, and God bless you, sir, for your kindness,” answered the\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the shed, built up a fire close by, and lay down it was\r\nafter nine o’clock, and as the wind had gone down, and the rain was\r\nover, it was not so chilly as to make wet garments especially\r\ndangerous, though sufficiently disagreeable. However, rolled up in the\r\nsail with my feet to the fire, I soon felt warm enough to sleep. The\r\nrescue of the two people on the island seemed likely to prove at least a\r\ntemporary hindrance to the execution of my plans; for I could not see\r\nhow it was possible, for a few days at least, to leave the island, as\r\nthe old man was in no condition to undertake such a voyage in an open\r\nboat, and probably would not survive it. Indeed, that the hardships\r\nwhich he had already undergone had not killed him was a sufficient\r\nmatter for wonder. No, I could not leave these people now, and at\r\npresent, for days and perhaps for weeks, it would be impracticable and\r\ncruel to attempt to carry him away either in my boat or his own.\r\nDoubtless, if I were to suggest departure, they would agree to it, and\r\nundertake the voyage; but I saw it would be little less than murder.\r\nHowever, if he should be no better in a week or two, then, provided he\r\nstill retained his present vitality, it might be wise to attempt to get\r\nhim where a physician could see him.\r\n\r\nIt was no use repining over this enforced delay. Humanity, and the\r\ncommonest sense of duty to my fellows, demanded that I should stand by\r\nthese helpless ones so long as they stood so absolutely in need of my\r\naid. The food question, which had long since ceased to trouble me, might\r\nnow, by reason of the increase in the number of mouths to fill, become\r\nsomething to require considerable exertion, planning, and thought. The\r\nweak spot in the larder was likely to be the supply of breadstuffs and\r\nvegetables. There would be no lack of pork and fish. Judging from the\r\nappearance of several boxes and gunny sacks on board the strangers’\r\nboat, there was a supply of food there which might be relied upon to\r\ntide over any present necessity that might arise, though my own supply\r\nwas still considerable.\r\n\r\nThen too I must rig up as soon as possible in the house, perhaps by\r\nhanging a curtain which could be temporarily drawn at night, a place of\r\nprivacy for the girl. At night the old man would require somebody to\r\nwatch him more or less, or at least be near him. I could not expect his\r\ndaughter to take this all upon herself, as that would be physically\r\nimpossible. How to manage about this puzzled me considerably. For a\r\nshort stay of a week or two I did not like to go to the considerable\r\ntrouble of enlarging my house, and yet the requirements of the situation\r\nseemed actually to demand three separate rooms.\r\n\r\nAt last, as a compromise, I hit upon the idea of cutting down the back\r\nwall of the house, between the house proper and the lean-to addition\r\nwherein my provisions were stored, and which had been used upon occasion\r\nas a smoke house. The provisions could be stored if necessary on board\r\nthe boats, or under the work-shed. And a wide doorway cut between the\r\ntwo compartments would, with a curtain dividing the larger one, give me\r\nthe necessary room. I myself would take as my sleeping-place the added\r\nroom, and by arranging a couple of bunks, the thing would be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nALICE AND HER FATHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when shortly after dawn I awoke from a sound,\r\nrefreshing sleep, my clothes were dried upon me, the storm had passed,\r\nand there was promise of a calm, clear day. Raking together the few\r\ncoals that remained, I soon had my fire burning brightly, and then went\r\ndown to look at the two boats lying in the creek. The stranger I found\r\nhad the name “Alice” painted on either bow. The “Alice” proved upon\r\ncloser examination a much larger boat than the “Mohawk.” She was fully\r\nfour feet longer, and much broader and deeper. A flush deck extended aft\r\nfrom the bows about one third of her whole length, and as in my own\r\nboat, was carried clear aft at each side of a well which was protected\r\nby an upright washboard. She was provided with an iron centre-board,\r\nhinged at the forward end on a pivot. A very considerable rise or sheer\r\nfore and aft indicated that she would be pretty safe in heavy weather\r\nand high seas. There was a good boat’s-compass swung in gimballs, and\r\nmounted near the after part of the well, where it would be in sight of\r\nthe steersman, and an extinguished lantern lying near it, as though to\r\nbe used when needed, for a binnacle light. The boat was very strongly\r\nbuilt, and evidently intended as a sea-going craft. An oiled tarpaulin,\r\nbuttoned over pins on the washboard, partly covered the well-hole\r\nforward, and evidently could be drawn over the whole opening in case of\r\nheavy seas.\r\n\r\nOf course I was much interested in the examination of the boat, and in\r\nthe minutest detail of her construction and condition, as I expected\r\nwhen I came to leave the island to use her instead of my own boat, an\r\nexchange of vessels greatly to my advantage. On the deck just forward of\r\nthe foremast a water cask had been lashed. The two hollowed skids nailed\r\nto the deck were still there in place. There was a ringbolt let into the\r\ndeck at each side originally, designed to take the cask lashings. One of\r\nthese ringbolts was pulled through the deck and the water cask was gone.\r\nThis condition told the story almost as plainly as words. A heavy sea\r\nhad struck the port bow and coming on board had washed away the cask,\r\ntearing out the bolt. The tarpaulin had saved the vessel from filling.\r\n\r\nI looked to the mooring-lines to see that both boats were secure, and\r\nthen waded over the creek to a place above the willows, where there was\r\na clear, bright-bottomed pool, sheltered from view and well adapted for\r\nthe fresh-water bath which I needed. Here, too, was a gourd of soap,\r\nplaced there on former occasions for the bath.\r\n\r\nI was in the very midst of the soap-and-water refreshment when I saw on\r\na log at the bank and among the leaves what I took for the head of a\r\nhuge python or boa constrictor. A hideous head, thrust out toward me\r\nthrough the foliage, bright eyes gleaming like jewels, a wrinkled,\r\npouchy throat,--the unmistakable reptilian characteristics,--caused a\r\nshiver of horror to pass through me for a moment. My first impulse was\r\nto fly and leave my clothing on the bank. Up to this time I had not seen\r\na single snake, great or small, venomous or harmless, on the island.\r\nBacking and edging slowly away, I soon reached a point where I could\r\nplainly see that my terrible snake had feet, Ah! it was nothing more\r\nnor less than an iguana, a great, harmless species of lizard that loves\r\nto haunt the banks of the streams; not only harmless but edible, a\r\ndelicate morsel for an epicure, hunted as zealously as the Marylanders\r\nseek for diamond-back terrapin.\r\n\r\nInstantly from fancying myself the hunted I became the hunter. I had\r\ntasted iguana-stew at Martinique, and had a distinct recollection of the\r\ndelicate white meat, with a flavor apparently compounded of those of\r\nspring chicken, green turtle, and frogs’ legs.\r\n\r\nThe reptile remained perfectly motionless, with the exception of a sort\r\nof regular waving of the folds of the pouched throat. I quietly lowered\r\nmyself into the water and went a few rods down stream to the boats,\r\nwhere I got a strong cord and a stout ten-foot cane pole. I made a\r\nrunning noose in the cord and hung it upon the pole. With this apparatus\r\nI returned and found the lizard still pumping slowly away with his\r\nthroat, in precisely the same place and attitude. Slowly and cautiously\r\nI waded up at one side, until I was distant the length of the pole, and\r\nthen by infinite degrees advanced the noose, watching the pumping in the\r\nwrinkled throat, until the loop was fairly over the head, but of course\r\nwithout touching the reptile.\r\n\r\nJust then the pumping action abruptly stopped. But I did not wait for\r\nhim to be off. On the contrary, I hauled aft on my line like lightning,\r\nthe noose closed around the ugly neck and jerked a fifty-pound iguana\r\nsplashing into the creek. As I had no mind to feel his sharp claws, I\r\ndrove the end of the pole into his mouth and thus between cord and pole\r\nheld him firmly in the water. He swam like a fish, but he was too\r\nsecurely caught to get away. I dragged him up to the bank where my\r\nclothing lay, and getting hold of my knife dispatched him; then I\r\nhurriedly clothed myself and cleaned the iguana, taking off the skin\r\nand cutting him up ready for the pot. And in fifteen minutes a good\r\nportion of him was in my iron kettle and on the fire.\r\n\r\nThough snaring big lizards is not perhaps within the strict limits of\r\nwhat may properly be called true sport, still I must say that for real\r\nexcitement, eager earnestness of pursuit, and genuine pleasure at the\r\ncapture, I have never experienced before nor since anything approaching\r\nthe hunter’s joy excited by this morning’s pot hunt for an iguana.\r\n\r\nAs I stood by the fire the door of the house opened, and the girl came\r\nout. She had on some sort of light dress, and all trace of the\r\nbedraggled condition of the previous evening was gone; her brown hair\r\nwas smoothly swept back from a face still pale, and a bit of bright\r\nribbon at the neck gave the effect of a flower. She came down toward me\r\nwith a kindly smile and a good-morning greeting, which I returned.\r\nSomehow a senseless, foolish embarrassment came over me, which like an\r\nidiot I attributed to the fact that I did not know her name. Actuated by\r\na ridiculous impulse, I pulled out my pocketbook and extracted therefrom\r\na stained and withered visiting-card, whereon in the most _recherché_\r\nstyle of the copperplate engraver’s art appeared my name, “William\r\nMorgan.” This precious document I handed to her with a deliberate bow,\r\nhat in hand. A smile ran over her countenance as she bent to receive it,\r\nso very expressive that I could not fail to understand it. She was\r\nundoubtedly laughing at me. Like a flash the full absurdity\r\nand incongruity of my act came over me. I pictured my own\r\nappearance,--barefoot, clad in pantaloons of moleskin stained to a\r\nthousand tints of autumn brown and rolled up half-way to the knee, a\r\nblue flannel shirt with sleeves rolled up and throat open, and a hat of\r\nbungling rushes; my skin, where exposed, tanned and peeled; a great\r\nbush and shock of hair, the growth of nine months, tangled and unkempt,\r\nfaded by the sun at the ends, and reaching down to my shoulders; the\r\ncavalier air; the limp, red-stained, dirty visiting card. I felt the hot\r\nblood surge for a moment into my face, and then the absurdity of it all\r\noverpowered me and I laughed aloud. She also, after a little struggle,\r\nand looking at me again to see, perhaps, whether I was hurt, joined in\r\nthe chorus, my visiting-card in her hand.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Morgan,” said she presently, “both my father and I are deeply\r\ngrateful to you. You saved our lives, and your kindness and tenderness\r\nto a helpless old man I shall never forget. I thank you for him and for\r\nmyself. My father’s name,” here there was a faint indication of a return\r\nof the smile, “is Caleb Millward, and mine is Alice.”\r\n\r\nI asked her how her father had passed the night, and was informed that\r\nhe had slept almost continuously, and was still slumbering peacefully.\r\nThen I told her that I thought her father was suffering from paralysis,\r\nproduced, probably, by cerebral hemorrhage; that some small blood vessel\r\nhad burst in the brain, and that if this could become absorbed in a\r\nreasonably short period he would probably recover the use of his\r\nfaculties either wholly or partially; that we could only await results,\r\nkeeping him warm, well nourished and quiet; that I believed this was all\r\nthe best of doctors could do for him, and that we must put our trust in\r\nhis good constitution and the favor of the Almighty, and hope for the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nI learned from her account that her father, Caleb Millward, was a\r\nmissionary, whose work for the past five years had been among the coolie\r\nlaborers, of whom large numbers from Hindostan and the lower provinces\r\nof China had been imported into various of the West India Islands, under\r\nwhat has been known as the contract-labor system, only another name for\r\nslavery. Her mother had died several years before, during a yellow fever\r\nepidemic, and since her death the Rev. Mr. Millward had broken up his\r\npermanent home station, and had travelled in a regular circuit from\r\npoint to point in his little schooner, making a complete round in a\r\nperiod of about six months. It was on one of these trips, while sailing\r\nfrom one small island to another, that the series of mishaps took place\r\nwhich resulted in their being cast away. There was on board only her\r\nfather, herself, and a young Jamaican of English descent, who was\r\nemployed to help sail the boat, and to take care of the vessel when in\r\nport. The voyage they were at the time engaged upon, was a traverse of\r\nabout twenty miles. The wind was fair with no appearance of bad weather.\r\nSuddenly a tremendous wave was seen approaching, not parallel with the\r\nswell but at an angle thereto. All three saw it coming down. Her father\r\ncalled out to the Jamaican to lower some sail, and the Jamaican was\r\nforward at this work, when the sea struck the boat with tremendous force\r\nand dashed him overboard, and also tore loose the water cask and carried\r\nit away. The Jamaican never rose to the surface. Her father, she said,\r\nappeared to be wonderfully affected by the accident, and soon grew faint\r\nand half stupid. Presently partially recovering, he set the sails so\r\nthat the boat was hove to under the sail that she subsequently bore,\r\nthen almost immediately sank down unconscious. He remained thus all day\r\nbreathing heavily, and then came to, but was unable to move. So they\r\ndrifted without water, until the storm came and they were drenched with\r\nspray. After a long period of suffering they were rescued as we have\r\nseen. This was the story of their disaster. Leaving Miss Millward to\r\nwatch the stew, I went up to the house, and finding the old man now\r\nawake gave him a thorough rubbing with my hands,--a sort of massage\r\ntreatment,--until the circulation of the blood was evident on the\r\nsurface. This seemed to do him good. Then I put on his clothes, now dry,\r\nand returned to the fire.\r\n\r\nMiss Millward had gone down to the “Alice” and rummaged out some spoons\r\nand knives and forks, a small tablecloth, some salt and some black\r\npepper, three bowls, three plates, and some glass tumblers, and had them\r\nat the fire in a hand basket, and the kettle containing the stew had\r\nbeen removed from the fire.\r\n\r\n“Now, Mr. Morgan,” said she, as I came up, “Let us understand each\r\nother. I intend while we stay here to make myself useful. I have been\r\ntaught to work, and the cooking and housekeeping are woman’s work. You\r\nwill let me do that work as far as I am able, will you not?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly I will, Miss Millward. There will be plenty of work for both\r\nof us. It will relieve me, and frankly, I think you will be better\r\ncontented and happier for it.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, then. Please give me a lift with this kettle to the house.\r\nOur breakfast is ready as soon as the cloth can be laid.”\r\n\r\nThat breakfast of delicious iguana-stew, toasted pilot-bread, and cool,\r\npure water sparkling in glass, set on a clean, white cloth, and eaten\r\nfrom real dishes with the table implements of civilization, will linger\r\nlong in my memory. I picture the scene before me even now; the cool\r\nwhite interior, the old man stretched on the couch, the table presenting\r\nto my long unaccustomed eyes an appearance of elegance, though plain and\r\ncommon enough in reality, the savory fragrance of the stew, the\r\nbeautiful girl seated opposite me, the open doorway, and the glimpse\r\nthrough it of the sunlit sea,--all return to me as a happy, pleasant\r\ndream. It seemed to me then like a dream, and as though it all might\r\nfade away on awakening.\r\n\r\nHeretofore I had eaten my food in a perfunctory fashion, spending no\r\nunnecessary time over it, with no special enjoyment except the\r\nsatisfaction due to hunger allayed. Now all was different. Meals were\r\nabout to become, I foresaw, delightful domestic episodes, enlivened by\r\ntalk and rendered social by companionship. This was life, and not a mere\r\nstruggle for existence.\r\n\r\nWe discussed the proposed changes to be made in the interior by cutting\r\nan enlarged opening through to the store-room, the hanging of a\r\nsail-cloth curtain, and the building of bunks. I explained how I was\r\ncast upon the island, and my experiences since then. But I did not\r\nmention the purpose of my voyage nor say anything about the wreck of the\r\ngalleon.\r\n\r\nWhen finally we had finished, and I had reluctantly risen, she said:\r\n“Mr. Morgan, I should like it very much if you would get me a broom.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing will be easier, Miss Housekeeper,” replied I, and immediately\r\nbrought in a cedar-bough. This she eyed ruefully, but accepted as the\r\nonly available substitute for the familiar domestic weapon.\r\n\r\nAll that day I devoted to the work of clearing out the store-house,\r\ncutting the opening, rigging up the curtain, and building a bunk for\r\nmyself in the new apartment. I did not build the second bunk, as I had\r\nintended, for a new plan had occurred to me; namely, to construct a\r\nmovable couch for Mr. Millward to lie upon, and on which I could convey\r\nhim on occasion out into the sun or on the porch, and upon which he\r\nmight be propped up in a sitting posture. But before the day was over I\r\nhad arranged some shelving at each side of the fireplace for Miss\r\nMillward’s dishes and domestic appliances. It was simply delightful to\r\nbe called to a dinner that I had no hand in preparing, and to witness\r\nthe air of homelike comfort given to the little house by this girl. The\r\nwhole atmosphere seemed changed. Not that one could note any great or\r\nmarked alteration; but in little details here and there, were evidences\r\nof a woman’s hand,--a bit of white cloth disposed over the windows as a\r\ncurtain, my nautilus shell set on the mantel-shelf with a spray of\r\nflowers, and a hundred similar trifles; perhaps most of all, the\r\nunaccustomed presence of others, the sound of a woman’s voice, her light\r\nfootstep, and the rustle of her garments. I did not attempt to analyze\r\nmy feelings, but at any rate the place seemed like a home, and I began\r\nin advance to regret the day of leaving it.\r\n\r\nThat night I slept again at the shed. Before I retired, however, Miss\r\nMillward asked me to wait until she read a chapter in the Bible to her\r\nfather. And when this was done she gently lifted the old man’s helpless\r\nhands together in an attitude of prayer, and then prayed aloud herself,\r\nin such a pathetic and tender manner that the tears came to my eyes in\r\nspite of myself.\r\n\r\nThe next day, after getting a stock of cedar, I started to fashion the\r\ncouch for Mr. Millward. This with the making of another armchair\r\noccupied two days. The couch I made like a great chair, with a back\r\npivoted to fold down or prop up, and wove an upholstery of rushes. It\r\noccurred to me that I could easily saw some wheels out of a round limb\r\nand mount them as rollers on which to move the couch more easily over\r\nthe smooth floor; and this improvement I added. When the couch was\r\nfinished there was then a bunk for each of the well ones and the couch\r\nfor the invalid, and I therefore took up my quarters in the house, which\r\nI was glad to do, as I could then give Miss Millward a needed relief in\r\nhelping watch the sick man at night. By wheeling his couch beside my own\r\nthis was an easy matter.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we wheeled the old gentleman out upon the porch and\r\npropped him up for a rest, until he would sign with his eyes to be\r\nlowered again. I kept up the rubbing daily. At the end of about a week I\r\nnoticed that he could move the fingers of his right hand. This was a\r\nmost promising sign; and I then began to rub him regularly three times a\r\nday. In the course of two days more he could use this hand and arm quite\r\nfreely, and recovered some power in the muscles of his neck so that he\r\ncould turn his head. But though he could utter some unintelligible\r\nsounds he could not yet articulate anything. He kept making signs as\r\nthough he wanted something, which I could not understand. I got out a\r\npencil and some paper, which he took and attempted to write, but I could\r\nnot read the characters. His daughter, however, coming out just then,\r\nwas able to comprehend his wants at once, and going in to where his coat\r\nhung, brought out his spectacles and placed them on his eyes. The old\r\nman then wrote plainly the word “Bible,” and the book was brought to\r\nhim. Propped up on his couch he turned the leaves and began to read with\r\nan air of perfect contentment. The distorted appearance of his face had\r\ngradually been passing away, and when his daughter gave him the book his\r\ncountenance was lighted up with a singularly sweet smile.\r\n\r\nIn the present condition of the old man I felt that if he could have a\r\nlittle generous wine, as port or Madeira, to drink it would be a benefit\r\nto him. Some alcoholic stimulant in small amount was evidently what he\r\nneeded. But such a thing could not be had. Why should I not make\r\nwhiskey? I remembered that the negroes frequently made what they called\r\npalm wine from the juice of the cocoanut palm. And I had drunk both the\r\nsweetish, fresh preparation and the same in the sour, fermented stage,\r\nthe latter being quite alcoholic in its nature. Moreover, I knew the\r\nwhole process of obtaining this drink; for I had watched the negro boys\r\nclimb the palms at Martinique, bind and cut the unopened flower spathes,\r\nand attach the small gourds or little earthen chatties to catch the\r\njuice as it trickled out.\r\n\r\nWithout explaining my purpose either to the old man or his daughter, I\r\nclimbed six palms that evening, bound the flower spathes to prevent them\r\nfrom opening, tied them in a bent position, and cut off the point,\r\nattaching to each spathe a gourd to receive the liquid drippings. The\r\nnext morning I collected from these trees nearly two gallons of sweet\r\nsap, and cutting each spathe to a fresh surface left them to flow again.\r\nWhen I brought the sap down it was already beginning to ferment, and had\r\nsomewhat the taste of sweet cider with a slight sparkle. I put half a\r\npint of it in a bottle, corked it tight, and tied the cork. Some of it I\r\nset in an open gourd in the shade; and about a gallon I set on the fire\r\nin a pan, intending to boil this latter portion down into syrup, or into\r\n“jaggery,” as the gummy, sweet preparation is called. In about three\r\nhours after collecting it that portion which was left in the open gourd\r\nhad changed to such condition as to have a sharp, sub-acid taste,\r\nsomething like hock. I immediately drank a tumbler full of it, and found\r\nin a few minutes that it had indeed already developed sufficient alcohol\r\nto make that amount all that a person of sober habits would care to\r\nimbibe at one time. It was pleasant to the taste and very refreshing,\r\nand had a sparkle and a slight hum like new ale, when poured into the\r\nglass. I gave the old man a tumbler full, and also his daughter, and for\r\ncompany’s sake took an additional half-tumbler myself. It did him good,\r\napparently, at least he seemed greatly to relish it, and held out his\r\nglass to be filled again.\r\n\r\n“Why, this is like wine!” exclaimed Miss Millward, “where did you get\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“We have wine trees on our island, Miss Millward, and I have been\r\ntapping them, as you will see,” pointing to the suspended gourds, some\r\nof which could be seen from the porch where we sat in the shade. I then\r\nexplained to her the whole process, and my purpose in making the wine. I\r\nshowed her the pan of boiling sap, and she at once undertook to attend\r\nto the treacle-making. That evening at supper I opened the bottle which\r\nI had filled, and the cork flew out with a report like a pistol, the\r\nwine bubbling and frothing like champagne. This the invalid drank alone.\r\nThe sap left in the open gourd turned quite sour, like vinegar; but I\r\ndid not have any use for it in that condition and so poured it out. The\r\nresult of the boiling was about a pint of thick, dark-colored sweet\r\nsyrup, or treacle, of a rather pleasant taste. By carrying the boiling\r\nstill farther it could of course be reduced to the condition of the\r\nsugar called jaggery. But it was more convenient for use in its treacly\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThe unusual and remarkable rapidity of the fermentative change in this\r\npalm-sap had the attendant inconvenience that it would require to be\r\ngathered fresh every day, if used for wine. I therefore concluded that I\r\nwould make a still and distil a brandy from the fermented sap, which I\r\ncould subsequently use as a check to the fermentation in the wine,\r\nafter the manner that port-wine, sherry, Madeira, and other similar\r\nwines are prepared. I took a large earthen jar which would hold three or\r\nfour gallons, and luted to the mouth of it with clay a gourd cut with an\r\nopening to correspond with the jar mouth. I then procured a long,\r\nstraight cane about three inches in diameter at the butt, tapering in a\r\nlength of twenty feet to less than an inch. I split this cane throughout\r\nthe whole length and cut away the septum or partition which occurs at\r\neach joint. I then joined the two split halves together, pitched the\r\njoint, and wound the whole length with cord to hold it solid, and\r\nafterwards wound over all a grass rope of rather loose texture. In the\r\nneck of the gourd I inserted the butt of this cane tube and luted the\r\njoint with clay, but so that it could be removed. The cane tube led away\r\nin a nearly horizontal direction, having a slight fall from the gourd\r\noutward.\r\n\r\nI now collected palm-sap enough to fill the jar, and when it had\r\nundergone a full fermentation, and just before it turned sour, I set it\r\non in the still to boil over a fire. The gourd and tube were in place\r\nand the joints well luted. Then as soon as the fermented sap began to\r\nboil and throw off vapor, I wet the grass rope that surrounded the tube,\r\nand set a vessel to receive what came dripping from the end of the tube\r\nin drops. Very soon the brandy began to come over in a warm, thin,\r\ntrickling stream. When I had collected a little over a quart I stopped\r\nthe process for fear of getting some other product over. It was good,\r\nstrong brandy, and had no disagreeable flavor, being quite clear, with a\r\nslight yellow tint.\r\n\r\nI had now what I needed for my wine-making, and made use of it in the\r\nfollowing manner: I collected a fresh supply of the sap and permitted\r\nfermentation to proceed in it until it was, as I thought, at the\r\nprecise point where it had the best sub-acid flavor. I then added some\r\nof the palm syrup to sweeten it a little, and also enough of the\r\nbrandy--about half a pint to the gallon--to stop the further\r\nfermentation. The wine so prepared had a rough resemblance to port. It\r\nwas quite pleasant to the taste, and would keep any length of time.\r\nHaving now a supply of about two gallons I made no more, as there was\r\nenough for the invalid, and nobody else needed it, or cared particularly\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nDay by day the old man slowly improved in condition until at the end of\r\nthree weeks he was able to sit in the armchair with comfort. He startled\r\nus one morning by uttering his daughter’s name, and little by little\r\nrecovered the use of his tongue. He was not yet able to stand or walk,\r\nand it was still doubtful whether he would recover the use of his lower\r\nlimbs. I felt reasonably confident, however, that he would do so\r\nultimately.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he could talk, almost his first words were a request to me to\r\nget the Jamaican sailor’s chest from the boat and use the clothing for\r\nmyself. I was glad enough to do this, as almost any sort of change was\r\nacceptable. I found in the chest a number of good shirts, both woollen\r\nand cotton, a good, serviceable suit of dark tweed, and two complete\r\nsuits of white duck; also socks and underwear, and a good straw hat.\r\nThese things fitted me very well, but a pair of dancing pumps were so\r\nsmall that I could not get them on my feet; however, my own shoes were\r\nstill very good. The kind-hearted old man then said that if I wished it\r\nhe would cut my hair; he thought he could use his daughter’s scissors\r\nwell enough. But I did not fancy having him clipping about my ears with\r\nuncertain fingers, and resolutely declined. My hair, which now reached\r\nto my shoulders, was as long as it was likely to grow. The ends,\r\nexposed freely, would naturally wear and fray away as fast as it grew,\r\nand I concluded to let it go as it was until I reached civilization.\r\n\r\nThinking about my plans one day, it occurred to me that it would not be\r\na bad idea to plant a garden for use when I should return to the island.\r\nPotatoes and yams, and fresh green corn would not be a bad provision to\r\nhave ready at hand in plenty while working at the sunken galleon. There\r\nwas a patch of good, rich soil near the creek, now covered with dry\r\ngrass, beneath which the new grass had sprung since the rains. By\r\nburning it over the ground might be readily cleared for a couple of\r\nacres in extent. I put fire to it at several places on the windward side\r\nand it was soon black and bare. I began at once with the shovel to break\r\nup the soil in spots, and to make hills for the potatoes and yams, and\r\nto form a place in which to plant the corn. With the hoe I could\r\nsubsequently go over the ground between the hills and cut up the grass\r\nwhen it started. After I had been working a couple of days at this\r\nsevere labor, Mr. Millward asked me why I thought it necessary to\r\nprepare to plant so extensively, as we should soon be leaving the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n“I shall be well enough in a week or two longer to go. You are making\r\nprovision there as though you expected we were all to remain here for\r\nsix months longer,” said he.\r\n\r\nI looked at him a moment before answering, debating with myself what\r\nreply to make. At last I said, “Mr. Millward, I expect to return to this\r\nisland after we have reached Martinique.”\r\n\r\n“And why should you do that?” he asked, with an air of surprise.\r\n\r\n“I may tell you the reason why, and think perhaps I shall,” I answered,\r\nand continued after a pause, “I believe I may trust you, and that you\r\nwill not betray me. It is now a secret known only to me.”\r\n\r\nThe old man said no more, and we changed the subject of conversation.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon while at work in the new garden I considered carefully\r\nthe propriety of telling the Millwards about the galleon. It would be a\r\ngreat comfort to have some one to talk to and advise with concerning the\r\nmatter, and I already knew enough of these people to feel confident they\r\nwould not betray me. On the other hand was it best to tell any one of my\r\nsecret? But I finally decided to give them my confidence. And that\r\nevening, as we sat in front of the fire,--a chill rain having set in,--I\r\ntold to the father and the daughter the whole story of my coming to the\r\nisland, the search for the wreck, the successful location of the sunken\r\nhulk, and also what my plans for the future were. Mr. Millward after\r\nlistening to it all said, “Now, Mr. Morgan, I am better able to\r\nappreciate the sacrifice you are making in remaining here with us, and\r\nthe great inconvenience to which we are putting you. Is it not better\r\nthat you should start at once? I think I shall now be able to stand the\r\nvoyage.”\r\n\r\n“As soon as you are strong enough to stand the voyage, Mr. Millward,”\r\nsaid I, “we will start; but not before that time.”\r\n\r\nMr. Millward now asked to see the pearls of which I had told him in the\r\ncourse of my statement. When I had handed them to him, he said, “These\r\npearls are highly valuable. I am sufficiently familiar with the value of\r\nsuch gems to be able to assure you that you have ten thousand dollars’\r\nworth here, at a very low estimate, and perhaps double that amount in\r\nvalue.”\r\n\r\nI asked him where I could find a market for them. He thought that it\r\nwould not be wise to attempt to sell them anywhere in the islands,\r\nunless at Havana, but that Havana would probably prove as good a market\r\nas I could find anywhere. He further told me that he had heard a rumor\r\nof a valuable pearl fishery having been found and secretly worked\r\nsomewhere among the islands. No doubt this island was the place. If so\r\nwe might expect the pearl fishers to return at any time. Now this was a\r\nprospect which was very far from pleasant to contemplate; not because\r\nthey might lay claim to my pearls,--I had no fear of that,--nor because\r\nI could not substantiate my right to the abandoned property, or if\r\nnecessary give them up without a murmur. The situation was more serious\r\nthan that. These pearl fishers, if they came, would be out in their\r\nboats and prowling about, and would be sure to find out what I was\r\ndoing. Moreover, they would doubtless be a well armed, lawless, and\r\nadventurous set. If they found us on the island, and knew that we had\r\ndiscovered their secret, there was no telling what they might do. It\r\nmade me feel very uneasy. If by any accident they should run across my\r\nbuoy, the first thing would be to send a diver down and my own secret\r\nwould be disclosed.\r\n\r\n“I shall go to-morrow morning and remove that buoy,” said I.\r\n\r\nThe old man agreed with me that this would be advisable.\r\n\r\nThat night I slept very little till toward morning. All night I lay\r\nthinking about the galleon and the treasure that it contained. If I only\r\nhad a diving-apparatus I could see my way clear. The old man and his\r\ndaughter would be all the help I should need. I began to dislike the\r\nidea of leaving the island even temporarily, until I had secured the\r\ntreasure. But probably I could not procure a submarine helmet and\r\ndiver’s dress, with air-tubes and pump, short of Kingston, Jamaica, or\r\nHavana in Cuba, and possibly not nearer than New York. Ah! the loss of\r\nmy diving-apparatus was a vexing misfortune. It might, and probably\r\nwould be more than six months before I could get back with these\r\nappliances. This line of cogitation finally brought me around to the\r\nthought that possibly I might be able to make a diving-apparatus myself\r\nwhich would answer my purpose. Why not? There must be some way to do it.\r\nAnd why shall I not find that way? I began to think it over by fairly\r\nstating the problem to myself, and before I went to sleep I had\r\nconvinced myself that I could make all the needed apparatus except the\r\nair-pump. But this was a device I could see no way to supply. “Never\r\nmind,” thought I, “it will suggest itself as I go along, if I keep my\r\nmind upon it. I will stay and try it.” With this resolve I felt better\r\ncontented, and soon dropped to sleep.\r\n\r\nAt dawn I was up, and immediately took out my boat and went to the buoy.\r\nThe wind was light and I had no difficulty in getting fast to it.\r\nInstead of taking up the buoy, as I had at first intended, I merely\r\nshortened the anchor line so that the buoy was held under water about\r\ntwo feet. I knew that the gourds would remain in this condition for a\r\nlong time, and with my sights on shore would enable me to find the\r\nneighborhood, while they would not be likely to be seen by others not\r\nlooking for them.\r\n\r\nWhen this was done I sailed back to the creek in time for breakfast,\r\ncongratulating myself on the additional peace of mind this act had\r\nbrought me. Now nobody would be likely to stumble on the galleon, and I\r\ncould give my thoughts to the problem before me.\r\n\r\nAs I rounded into the creek before the wind, I saw the graceful figure\r\nof Alice Millward, who was coming down from the house to look after her\r\nfire for breakfast. When I came up I found her lamenting that not a\r\nsingle spark could be found alight, and that the breakfast must needs be\r\nlate, or cold. But the sun was already well up above the sea,--at least\r\nan hour and a half high,--and I found no difficulty in procuring a blaze\r\nwith the burning-glass, and the fire was soon burning bravely.\r\n\r\nI sat down in the shade of the shed, while she busied herself with the\r\nsimple cookery, and thought as I looked on, what a beautiful girl this\r\nwas, with her clean-cut profile, her floating tendrils of silken, brown\r\nhair, her well rounded form, the graceful poise of her shapely head, the\r\nelastic step, the sweet voice humming bits of song, the cheerful,\r\nmusical laugh. She was fair indeed, and more than that I knew she was\r\npure and true in everything, a lovely and lovable woman. I then and\r\nthere confessed to myself that she had become a part of my life. I was\r\nin love, and the strange delight of her presence thrilled my heart with\r\nnew emotion. Up to this time my thoughts had been bent solely on getting\r\na treasure buried in the sea; I now realized that here was a treasure\r\nrecovered from the sea, which if I could hope to call it my own, would\r\nfar exceed in value all the gold and jewels ever carried by the richest\r\nfleet that ever floated on the Spanish seas. It was all so new and\r\nstrange and sudden to me that I was afraid to stay longer near her, lest\r\nI might be obliged to speak to her, and thus betray myself. So I got up\r\nand wandered away to the edge of the forest. But the leaves trembling in\r\nthe gentle morning breeze seemed to whisper my secret; the rasping\r\nlocust, which had been noisily droning all night long, seemed to play it\r\nin every trill; the birds sang it.\r\n\r\nSo this was love,--love that makes the world go round; that comes once\r\nat least into each life, and fills it with light and sweetness, or with\r\ngloom and sorrow. When did I begin to love this girl? I could not tell.\r\nYesterday I did not know it, but it must be that I loved her then as\r\nnow; and before that and ever since I had first seen her. And even\r\nbefore I had seen her had not my heart been waiting for her? But now I\r\nfelt that somehow our relations had changed. Could I have again the\r\nsense of comradeship that I had felt toward her? Would she not see a\r\nchange in me? I could not analyze this new sensation nor predict what\r\nwould happen. A dreadful doubt and uncertainty oppressed my heart\r\nsimultaneously with its new-born gladness. Could I hope that this sweet\r\nmaid would ever find anything to love in me?\r\n\r\nA hot, despairing wave of self-depreciation came over me. I looked at\r\nmyself in imagination,--my great hulking frame, my tanned skin, my\r\nbearded face, my long, unkempt hair. Oh, William Morgan, what a poor\r\nfool you are to fall in love with this fair vision of beauty, this\r\ndomestic goddess, this Hebe, this sum of grace and loveliness. And then\r\na tender desire welled up and filled my heart to love and cherish and\r\nprotect this helpless waif that had floated in to me from the wild sea.\r\n\r\nAfter a little I plucked a spray of orchids that hung from a half-rotten\r\nlimb,--one of those strange, rare flowers that seem rather the dreamy\r\nvagary of a flower painter than a natural production. They were white,\r\nbut beautifully marked with spots of rich purple and ribs of golden\r\nyellow. This spray I carried to the house, and gave it to her. Such an\r\nact could have no particular significance, but to my distempered fancy\r\nit seemed a homage paid, a tribute given, a declaration of fealty.\r\n\r\nAt the breakfast table I broached the subject of the galleon, and\r\nstated that I had almost determined to remain upon the island and to\r\nundertake the recovery of the treasure by aid of such apparatus as could\r\nbe made here, provided they were willing to delay their departure a\r\nsufficient time. The truth was that since the last hour my mind was\r\nfully made up to stay if possible, and the presence of Alice Millward\r\nwas doubtless a moving cause for that determination. I felt very anxious\r\nthat they should both fall in with my plan.\r\n\r\n“I think,” said I to the old man, “that if you go on improving as you\r\nhave done, you will soon be able yourself to give me the aid I need. And\r\nremember, in that case there will probably be treasure enough for all.\r\nIn the mean time, while you are getting well your daughter and I can be\r\nmaking preparations for the work. There is a great deal to be done. Now\r\nwhat do you say?”\r\n\r\n“But let me know exactly your plan of work,” replied he, “in order that\r\nI may be better able to judge of its feasibility.”\r\n\r\nThereupon I detailed my proposed scheme, so far as it was formulated in\r\nmy mind, confessing that I had as yet thought of no practical method of\r\nmaking an air-pump. “Still,” said I, “there is no doubt in my mind that\r\nsome method of supplying that deficiency will occur to me.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Mr. Morgan, let me think this over for a little while. There is\r\nno hurry required of me in making up my mind, for I should not like to\r\nleave the island for a week or so anyhow. Give me, say three days; but\r\nduring this time there is no reason why you should be idle. If in the\r\nmean time some practicable method of completing the apparatus should\r\noccur to you I am free to say that fact would have great weight in\r\ndetermining my course of action.”\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we all went out on the porch and sat down, Duke lying in\r\nthe sun at the old man’s feet. We discussed at great length the whole\r\nart and mystery of wrecking and diving, and the apparatus for such work.\r\n\r\nIn this discussion Alice Millward took an active part. She seemed so\r\nanxious to learn and know all about it that I went over, for her\r\nbenefit, all the book knowledge I had pertaining to the subject. While\r\nthis was not very extensive, the brief descriptions of apparatus\r\nfamiliar to me helped us all wonderfully to get a clearer idea of the\r\nproblem before us. There was one method of raising sunken vessels about\r\nwhich I had read somewhere that was specially interesting and\r\nsuggestive. This method is to attach to the hull barges partly filled\r\nwith water, and pump the water out of the barges little by little, until\r\nby reason of their rise in the water the hull is lifted clear of the\r\nground. Then barges and hull are towed into shallower water and the\r\noperation is repeated until finally the shore is reached. But this\r\noperation would require diving-apparatus for attaching the hawsers or\r\nropes to the sunken hulk, and it brought us, therefore, no nearer a\r\ncomplete solution of the problem.\r\n\r\nThe talk was interesting and animated, and was kept up until the old man\r\ngave signs of weariness. Finally, in the midst of a discussion as to the\r\nbest method of making an air-tube, he dropped to sleep. The practical\r\nbenefit which I derived from this conversation was the familiarity\r\nobtained by holding up before the mind all the conditions and\r\nnecessities of the problem, in the effort to make others understand\r\nthese requirements. It is by steady and continuous thought that all\r\nproblems are solved, and the first requisite of every solution is this\r\nvery faculty of holding all the conditions without effort\r\nsimultaneously in the mind. By continued effort mental process becomes\r\nfinally so far a matter of mere habit, in any particular case, that the\r\nmind is left wholly free to act. It is a familiar saying with regard to\r\nmathematics, that a problem clearly stated is already half solved. This\r\nis true with regard to everything depending upon human thought. But\r\nproblems are not solved by a mere effort of the will. The mind of man\r\ndoes not so operate. One must jostle various thoughts about in the\r\nbrain, until finally by an unconscious process of selection the fitting\r\nthought is found, and its fitness perceived. One thing suggests another\r\nand that a third, link by link in a continuous chain, until the mind\r\nfinally sees in the procession the needed thing, and immediately seizing\r\nupon it ignores all else.\r\n\r\nI wanted to be alone that I might, by revolving the riddle over and\r\nover, finally seize the key and unlock it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ABANDONED PLANTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalling Duke I took my lasso and the axe, and started out for a long\r\ntramp to the woods, where I might think undisturbed.\r\n\r\nThat the walk might not be wholly aimless, I decided to go up the beach\r\nto the north a little way, and then strike over to that part of the\r\ncreek which ran down parallel with the beach and follow it up to its\r\nhead-waters. Poor Duke thought this was a hunting expedition pure and\r\nsimple. His delight was extravagant to witness. For each foot I\r\ntravelled he went at least six. Forward and back, ranging to and fro\r\ninto every nook and corner, with his sensitive nose investigating\r\neverything, he made the most of his holiday. The gulls were out as\r\nusual, but Duke ignored them completely. Ne had already learned that\r\nthis fowl was not game, and as he measured all things by that single\r\nstandard, these birds had sunk to a point in his estimation that was\r\nbeneath the contempt of a well-bred dog. We routed up an armadillo just\r\nafter we crossed the creek, and captured it. Being so near home, I\r\ncarried it back and instructed Miss Alice how to bake it in the oven, in\r\nthe afternoon, for supper, and filled the oven with wood for her to\r\nlight at the proper time. Then telling her I might not return much\r\nbefore nightfall, I started anew.\r\n\r\nAfter we had crossed the creek again and had walked about a mile, we\r\ncame on about a half-dozen pigs on the beach, most probably varying\r\ntheir diet with a few clams. When they saw us the little herd dashed\r\nacross the sands and into the tangled jungle. Following them I found\r\nthey had here a beaten path, which showed that this was one of their\r\nregular run-ways. I conjectured that this path would lead to the stream\r\nat some point, and so took advantage of it. In and out it went, well\r\ndefined, through the thicket and the jungle; here through dense brakes\r\nof fern, there under great trees, until finally the stream was reached\r\nat a point higher up than I had ever before ascended. All about were\r\ngreat numbers of calabash trees full of gourds, literally thousands of\r\nthem in all stages of growth, some fallen to the ground from\r\nover-ripeness. The inhabitants of this island need never want for such\r\nutensils as could be made of this vegetable product. What greatly\r\nsurprised me was the size of the stream at this point. It had not\r\nseemingly diminished either in depth or width, though I had naturally\r\nexpected it would be considerably less; for we were over three miles by\r\nits winding course from the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe path, without the aid of which I could not have penetrated the dense\r\ngrowth, led along the bank of the stream close to the water. About a\r\nquarter of a mile further on the course of the stream changed, coming\r\naround a bend from the west, straight from the cliffs. I pressed on and\r\nsoon found myself in a deep, narrow gorge, the path still running\r\nalongside the stream on a narrow margin of rocky shore, the cliff\r\ntowering straight up on either hand. On the top of the rocks, at the\r\nlevel of the central plateau, was a dense forest, the trees of which,\r\ngrowing close to the gorge at each side, interlaced in a mass of foliage\r\nabove, at times shutting out the sky. I followed the stream along the\r\npath entirely through the central plateau, and came out on the other\r\nside in what I have before spoken of as the north valley.\r\n\r\nI was now in a bowl-shaped depression, walled in on the east by the\r\ncliffs of the central plateau, through which I had just come by way of\r\nthe stream-cut gorge; on the west by the western rise or ridge which\r\nformed the shore cliffs, and which circled around to the north; and on\r\nthe south by the connecting ridge between the plateau and the cliffs.\r\nThe stream wound away in lazy curves through the flat bottom, and its\r\nhead-waters seemed as far away as ever. To the right hand the sunlit\r\ngleam of water caught my eye at a distance, and I passed through the\r\nbushes until I discovered a narrow cleft in the rocks to the northwest,\r\nthrough which came a glimpse of the distant sea. There was a park-like\r\nappearance to some portion of this enclosure that was delightful. Across\r\nthe middle, east and west, ran a little knoll, which formed the\r\nwater-shed. All the water which fed the stream evidently came from the\r\ndrainage of the valley south of this knoll. What water drained from the\r\nnorth slope probably had to find its way to the sea through the distant\r\ncleft.\r\n\r\nI followed the stream until the path at its edge faded away to nothing,\r\nand then turned off toward the centre of the valley through the open\r\ngrassy glades which were interspersed among the beautiful groves and\r\nclumps of trees. Very soon I came upon decided evidence of the hand of\r\nman. An old orange grove was here, planted regularly in rows; the trees\r\nbroad and spreading, and at least fifty years old, were loaded with the\r\ngolden, russet-tinted globes. The fruit was sweet and delicious. One\r\nvariety, a tree with gnarled branches and mossy trunk, bore literally\r\nthousands of the small, yellow mandarin oranges, with a skin loose and\r\nthin as paper. Here too were rows of red-berried coffee-trees, thorny\r\nlimes, and low-growing lemons, with here and there a dark-leafed\r\ngrape-fruit. The whole plantation was more or less choked with weeds and\r\nundergrowth, clearly indicating abandonment, perhaps for years.\r\n\r\nNear by were the great banner-like leaves of the banana and plantain, in\r\nabundance. This was a most valuable find, and it removed from my mind\r\nall fear of lack of food. Man can live almost upon the plantain alone.\r\nAnd it has been said that this valuable fruit furnishes food to more\r\nmillions than any other vegetable product, not even excepting rice.\r\nPushing on through the luxuriant growth that cumbered the earth, I came\r\nout finally into a little clearing on the top of the rise and found\r\nbefore me several low buildings. The weeds that grew all about, choking\r\nthe paths and overflowing in all directions, too plainly told the tale\r\nof long desertion and abandonment. There was a principal dwelling-house\r\nof a single story, built of adobes, with a wide veranda; also three\r\nsmaller houses at a little distance,--servants’ quarters probably; a\r\nlarge, low shed about which were scattered great heaps of old bagasse,\r\nor crushed sugar-cane, which indicated a sugar plantation; a\r\ntobacco-curing shed, in which still hung some shreds and fragments of\r\nwithered tobacco; and other outhouses. There was an air of desolation\r\nabout the place that was most depressing, as I stood waist-deep among\r\nthe thrifty growth of weeds in the clear, hot sunshine, looking in\r\nastonishment at the scene.\r\n\r\nI opened the front door and went into the house. All was vacancy and\r\ndesolation,--dust, cobwebs, stains of water that had leaked in and\r\npooled in spots upon the floor, dead flies, bugs, and spiders. There was\r\na broken window-pane in one room, and through the small opening thus\r\nmade had entered a great litter of dead leaves, which lay strewn about,\r\nindicating by their number the considerable time that must have elapsed\r\nwhile one by one they chanced to blow through the narrow opening. I was\r\nglad to get out again into the open air.\r\n\r\nHere had been at one time a considerable plantation. Hundreds of acres\r\nhad doubtless been under cultivation, and the busy sounds of life had\r\nbeen heard where now, save for the mournful complaint of a dove cooing\r\nfrom the orange grove for its mate, all was still.\r\n\r\nThat this plantation should have been unknown to me all this time seemed\r\nsurprising to me at the moment. But in truth, had I not followed up the\r\ncourse of the creek, it is quite probable I never should have discovered\r\nit; for all about on every hand were rocky walls and dense foliage, both\r\nhiding it from view and rendering it difficult of access. There were\r\nreally but two roads to this place from the outer world, one by the way\r\nI had just come, and the other by way of the sea through the distant\r\ncleft above spoken of.\r\n\r\nTraces of a broad road led from the buildings toward this cleft, and I\r\nfollowed it down past the remains of sugar, corn, and tobacco fields,\r\nuntil I stood on the margin of a deep, rock-walled cove, open on one\r\nside to the valley, where was a rude landing-pier, and on the other by a\r\nnarrow gate or passage to the sea. This was the harbor and port of the\r\nold plantation. The cove, though so small, would have floated a\r\nman-of-war, and was almost land-locked, the narrow entrance not being\r\nabove thirty feet in width at the water level.\r\n\r\nI remembered that when I made the circuit of the island on foot I waded\r\nacross the mouth of this cove at low water. There must therefore be a\r\nbar, with barely water enough at low tide to get a boat over; but at\r\nhigh tide there would probably be twelve or fifteen feet. That I did not\r\nsee the wooden pier at that time was due to the fact that the cove took\r\na bend to the left after entering from the sea. Had the rocks been less\r\nabrupt, I should doubtless have turned in at that time and endeavored to\r\ncross the island here instead of going a mile farther north, beyond the\r\nlimits of the valley.\r\n\r\nI wandered over the abandoned plantation in all directions for several\r\nhours, but found nothing of special interest except a flock of half-wild\r\ndomestic chickens, descendants doubtless of some left by the former\r\nresidents here. I gathered a dozen leaves of tobacco, thinking that Mr.\r\nMillward might like to have a cigar. After eating the frugal lunch I had\r\nbrought, supplemented with some fruit, I sat down under an orange-tree\r\nand rolled me a cigar of some of the dried leaf, which I lighted with\r\nthe burning-glass, and proceeded to enjoy a quiet smoke of the fragrant\r\ntobacco. While I sat thus slowly and placidly cogitating over the means\r\nof reaching the treasure, and varying that line of thought from time to\r\ntime with speculations as to the former inhabitants of the island,\r\nsuddenly the whole plan which had been floating unformed in my mind took\r\nconcrete shape, apparently of its own accord and without effort. The\r\nriddle was read and the problem was solved.\r\n\r\nThe day had worn away, and the afternoon was half over when I concluded\r\nit was high time to be gone. So I got me a great banana-leaf, gathered a\r\ngoodly lot of fruit, taking samples of all, including some of the\r\ncoffee-berries, and tying the whole securely in a bundle with the\r\nbanana-leaf and some bark strips, started for home, which I safely\r\nreached an hour before sunset.\r\n\r\nAs I came in sight of the house I saw standing poised on a rock near the\r\ncreek the graceful figure of Alice Millward, evidently on the lookout\r\nup the beach to see if the wanderers were coming. I waved my hand, and\r\nshe at once jumped down and began to put the supper in readiness. And\r\nwhen I reached the house I found the table all spread beneath the porch,\r\nand the hot baked armadillo smoking on the board. I untied my great\r\nbundle and spread out before them the supply of oranges, lemons,\r\nplantains, bananas, etc., in a tempting heap.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Mr. Millward caught sight of the red berries, he cried, “Ah,\r\ndelightful! you have found coffee! That was the chief thing your island\r\nlacked, friend Morgan. Now we can have our morning cup of coffee. But\r\nwhere did you find all this?”\r\n\r\n“Come, father, let us have our supper, while it is hot,” interrupted\r\nAlice Millward, “and the fruit will be a dessert for us. And I am sure\r\nwhile we are at table Mr. Morgan will tell us his adventures, and where\r\nhe has been to-day.”\r\n\r\nThis was too plainly desirable on all hands to be gainsaid, at least so\r\nfar as the first part of the proposal was concerned.\r\n\r\nOf course I had to go over the whole ground and describe the old,\r\nabandoned plantation as minutely and completely as I could, and to\r\nanswer a hundred inquiries about it. The question was raised whether we\r\nhad better not go there to live while we remained on the island, but it\r\nwas decided that for the present we had better remain where we were, for\r\nseveral reasons; one reason was the trouble of removal, another the fact\r\nthat we would there lose the refreshing sea breeze, and there were\r\nothers quite sufficient to determine the matter in favor of staying. But\r\nat any rate we would as soon as possible sail around in the boat to the\r\nplantation cove and make a visit to the plantation. Speculation was\r\nindulged in as to who had lived there, and when and why the place had\r\nbeen abandoned. The explanation offered by Mr. Millward was quite\r\nsatisfactory. He had frequently known of plantations being made on the\r\noutlying islands, and stated that they were always subsequently\r\nabandoned because of the difficulty of reaching a market for the\r\nproducts, the necessity for frequent voyages in the sloops and small\r\nvessels, and also the difficulty of keeping workmen and assistants long\r\nin such places, except as slaves.\r\n\r\nAfter the supper was over I rolled a dry tobacco-leaf into a couple of\r\nungainly cigars and handed one to the old man. The pleasure he expressed\r\nat this simple offering was quite extravagant.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, young man, you have made here a wonderful find,--quite equal in\r\nevery respect to the coffee. This is the true solace and comfort of the\r\ncontemplative man. I thank you most sincerely.”\r\n\r\nBut he would not light the cigar; he had other views of the proper use\r\nto make of it. Drawing from his coat pocket a venerable brown pipe, he\r\nproceeded to break up my cigar and fill the bowl with the fragments.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said he when he had finished, “if you will give me a light I will\r\nwarm the heart of this old companion, and my own at the same time.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Millward,” said I, after we had the smoking fairly started, “I have\r\nfound the way to the treasure in the sunken galleon.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, then you have hit upon a plan of making the air-pump. Well, I am in\r\na mood just now to believe you can do it. Pray let us know about it.”\r\n\r\n“No, sir, I have not found any way to build an air-pump. But I have\r\nfound, I think, that we shall not need one.”\r\n\r\n“But how can you get air to breathe under water unless it is pumped to\r\nyou?” said Miss Alice.\r\n\r\n“I do not expect to go under water,” said I in reply. And continuing, “I\r\nam inclined to enjoy your perplexity a little, for perplexity is what I\r\nhave been enduring myself until a very simple idea occurred to me this\r\nvery afternoon. But it is not fair to expect you will understand without\r\nexplanation in a moment what another could not understand for months.\r\nThe simple fact is this: if I cannot go under water to the ship, why\r\nshould I not bring the ship out of water to me? It is the old case, you\r\nsee, of the mountain and Mahomet.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I see it is,” said the old man,--“with this difference, that you\r\npropose to have the mountain come to Mahomet.”\r\n\r\nThereupon I laid my whole plan before them, which was briefly this: to\r\nattach to the hulk, one at a time, sinking them under water, enough\r\nempty calabashes to raise it and float it gradually in to shore, where\r\nat low tide it would be above water. The mechanical principle was the\r\ncommon one belonging to every device which converts speed into power;\r\nas, for example, the lever, the screw, or the inclined plane. Little by\r\nlittle with slight exertion of power each calabash or gourd could be\r\npulled down under water to the wreck, and would continue thereafter to\r\nlift as many pounds as were required to pull it down. When this lifting\r\npower was multiplied by enough of the calabashes, the wreck would surely\r\nbe raised. It was, after all, only a modification of the method of\r\nraising hulks by sinking and attaching barges partly full of water and\r\nthen pumping the water out and causing them to rise and lift the wreck.\r\nIn that case the slow application of the power was accomplished by\r\npumping. In the proposed method it consisted in pulling down the\r\ncalabashes one at a time.\r\n\r\nMr. Millward likened the operation to the lifting of an entire building\r\nby the hod carrier who carried a few bricks at a load up the ladder.\r\n\r\n“But how will you attach your numerous calabashes to the hull?” said the\r\nold man after a little thought. “It will take a great number.”\r\n\r\n“That I will explain to you in detail,” said I, and thereupon set forth\r\nminutely the entire plan of operation. The explanation was satisfactory\r\nto his mind. He at once said to me that he thought the thing feasible,\r\nand was satisfied that it would probably succeed.\r\n\r\nWhat those minute details were and how successfully they were carried\r\nout will appear when we come to the account of the attempt which was\r\nsubsequently made.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said I, “we have a great quantity of rope to make, some hawsers,\r\nand a huge supply of small rope and cord. To do this will take a long\r\ntime, and I have a notion that some sort of a spinning or twisting\r\nmachine will be necessary. We must establish a regular rope-walk here in\r\na small way.”\r\n\r\nThis immediately led to a long discussion and a consideration of\r\nrope-making machinery in general, at the conclusion of which I thought I\r\ncould see a way of making a sort of spinning-machine for twisting\r\nrope-yarn out of the cocoa husks, and also a reel for laying such\r\nstrands up into rope. Having worked out the plan in my own mind I\r\nresolved to set about it at once. Mr. Millward had given his hearty\r\nassent to remain on the island long enough to make a full effort to\r\nrecover the treasure, and I began now to look forward to a successful\r\ncompletion of my task.\r\n\r\nThe full moon that evening was shining over the calm sea out of a clear\r\nsky with a pure silvery radiance, and a cool, gentle breath of air,\r\nscarcely enough to ripple the surface of the sea, fanned our faces as we\r\nthree sat looking out upon the water from under the little porch. It was\r\na lovely night, almost too beautiful to put to such commonplace use as\r\nsleep. In a little while Mr. Millward asked me to push his couch into\r\nthe house, as he thought he would retire. After that Alice Millward and\r\nI sat for an hour longer, enjoying the moonlight and talking low so as\r\nnot to disturb him.\r\n\r\nShe told me much about the wandering life she and her father had led; of\r\nthe many kind and thoughtful acts of the poor benighted laborers who\r\nformed his audiences; of her own efforts to learn Hindostanee that she\r\nmight help him in his work; of the hardships and sorrows of these\r\npeople, and of the strange characteristics of the various races, Hindoo,\r\nChinese, and negro that made up the heterogeneous mass to which her dear\r\nfather had undertaken to teach the word of God.\r\n\r\n“How do you like the idea, Miss Millward,” said I, “of staying several\r\nmonths longer on the island?”\r\n\r\n“I am delighted,” answered she. “It is pleasant to see my father\r\nimproving so rapidly; and the days pass quickly with the work we have to\r\ndo. You know I like such housework, and have never had much chance to do\r\nit. Now here I am in sole charge of all the housekeeping arrangements,\r\nnobody to say I must not do this, or must do that. I feel quite as\r\nthough I were empress, with none to dispute my sway. Ought I not to be\r\ncontented?”\r\n\r\n“I am very glad you are contented,” said I, “and hope you may continue\r\nso. For I want to see you happy. Indeed, Miss Millward,” I continued,\r\nwith a slight tremor in my voice in spite of myself, “having done myself\r\nthe honor to save you from the sea, I feel somehow responsible for your\r\ncomfort and welfare, at least, I mean, while you remain on this island,\r\nand until you and your father reach civilization and your friends again.\r\nAnd even then I shall--I shall not like entirely to lose sight of you.\r\nIt gives me pain to think that our ways may then perhaps lie far apart\r\nfrom each other.”\r\n\r\nNow there was a twang of maudlin sentimentality in this, which I\r\nrecognized as I spoke the words, and this was magnified and intensified\r\nby the moonlight, and the trembling voice, so that I felt somehow as\r\nthough I wanted to knock my head against something hard. I somehow felt\r\ntoo that she ought in all consistency to laugh at me. But she did not\r\nlaugh. And though I could see her clear-cut beautiful profile in the\r\nmoonlight, there was no sign of even a smile upon it. God bless me! how\r\nwonderfully pure and sweet she did look that night.\r\n\r\nAfter a short silence I added, “I hope after we leave the island we\r\nshall not become wholly strangers, you and I and your father.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Mr. Morgan,” said she, smiling now, and turning her candid eyes to\r\nme, “I thought we had just decided not to leave the island for some\r\nmonths. I am very sure that we,--my father and I and you can never\r\nbecome strangers. We must always be the best of friends whatever\r\nhappens. It is not so easy to forget a good friend as you seem to\r\nimagine. And you have surely been one to us,--and especially to my poor\r\nfather in his helplessness. But the dew is falling fast, and I must now\r\ngo in. Good night, my friend, my good friend.”\r\n\r\nI sat long after that, alone in the moonlight, with the dew sparkling on\r\neach leaf in silvery lustre, thinking of my new found love, and hoping\r\nand despairing by turns, until the regular and peaceful breathing of the\r\nold man reminded me that I was uselessly dissipating precious hours that\r\nshould be devoted to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nA REMARKABLE CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the weather was now so fine, I thought it best to begin the gathering\r\nof calabashes, before going regularly to the work of rope-making. I\r\nshould need an immense quantity of these gourds, and they must be as dry\r\nas possible and perfectly sound, or they would be unserviceable for my\r\npurpose. The collection and transportation of these gourds would have\r\nproved an immense task but for a happy thought which occurred to me;\r\nthat was to make the stream do the major part of the labor. With this\r\nview I drove a row of stakes across the creek just above where the boats\r\nwere moored. These stakes were placed close enough together to catch\r\nevery gourd that floated down stream. After this precaution was taken I\r\nwent with my axe to the calabash grove and began the work of gathering\r\nthe gourds, throwing them into the water of the stream. Soon they were\r\nbobbing along down stream in a steady procession. I worked faithfully at\r\nthis for more than half a day, and until I had just time to get home\r\nbefore supper. When I arrived I found that Alice Millward had been busy\r\nfishing out the floating gourds, and had a huge pile on the sand, and\r\nthat the creek was still literally filled with them for several rods\r\nabove the row of detaining stakes. In coming home I had followed down\r\nthe stream, wading, with a pole to dislodge all that had caught on the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nWet and tired and hungry though I was, I went immediately to work\r\nthrowing the gourds out on the bank where they might begin drying and\r\nhardening, and it was long after sunset before I finished this\r\ndisagreeable labor. I was very glad to change my wet clothing and to sit\r\ndown to the cheerful supper-table which the patient Alice had kept\r\nwaiting for me.\r\n\r\n“You must have worked very steadily, Mr. Morgan,” said she; “there has\r\nbeen a constant stream of those great calabashes coming down all the\r\nafternoon.”\r\n\r\n“I see that you also were not idle,” said I. “The great heap of gourds I\r\nfound taken out must have kept you pretty busy.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, indeed, I was very busy, and kept the creek clear for quite a\r\nwhile,” said she; “but then they began to arrive like a marching army,\r\nand soon overwhelmed me. I suppose you have enough of them collected\r\nnow, have you not?”\r\n\r\n“No, Miss Millward, perhaps there is half enough. I shall go again\r\nto-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“The sight of that immense number of calabashes makes me better able to\r\nrealize the magnitude of the task we have undertaken,” remarked the old\r\ngentleman, in a thoughtful tone.\r\n\r\n“But that should not trouble us,” I said; “we have plenty of time before\r\nus, and a little done every day makes a great deal. Now I roughly\r\ncalculate that we must have a pile of gourds as large as the Spanish\r\ngalleon, if you can imagine it lying on the beach; for the floating\r\ncapacity of these round gourds in a heap would not represent, owing to\r\nthe interstices between the individual gourds, more than half that of a\r\nsingle, great gourd of the size of the heap. Or to put it in another\r\nway, let us say we want a sufficient number of gourds to hold half the\r\nair that the galleon would hold if empty of water. Such a capacity\r\nwould require, I imagine, a pile of gourds as great as the galleon. At\r\nany rate we will offer that for as good a guess as we are able now to\r\nmake. I suppose we might estimate the cubical contents of the galleon,\r\nand so determine mathematically with reasonable accuracy just how many\r\ngourds would do the work of lifting it,--that is to say, of equalling\r\nits displacement or sufficiently approaching it. But I think we shall be\r\nnear enough with our guess without that trouble.\r\n\r\nThe next day, starting earlier, I finished collecting the gourds by\r\nnoon, and had them all out of the creek before two o’clock in the\r\nafternoon. As the wind was light and favorable, I proposed that we spend\r\nthe remainder of the day in a voyage to the plantation, stay there all\r\nnight, and return in the morning. This was heartily agreed to, and we\r\nspeedily loaded the few things we were likely to need on board the\r\n“Alice,” including an armchair and Mr. Millward’s couch. When all was\r\nready for the embarkation I carried him down and seated him, well\r\nbraced, just aft of the centre-board.\r\n\r\nWe now hoisted sail and passed out over the bar. As we came into the\r\nneighborhood of the sunken galleon it was just three o’clock by Mr.\r\nMillward’s watch, the sun was shining brightly, and the water was clear.\r\nIf I could pick up the submerged buoy I could now with the water-glass\r\nshow my companions the wreck. My sight poles on shore were down, and I\r\ncould only guess at the locality. However, with Miss Millward standing\r\non the fore deck keeping a bright lookout for the bunch of submerged\r\ngourds, I cruised about as near as I could guess to the neighborhood. In\r\na few minutes she caught sight of them, and we were speedily made fast.\r\nWe hauled up directly above the wreck and put the glass over the side;\r\nthen all, including Mr. Millward, who managed to do so by our joint\r\nassistance, took a good look at the venerable hulk.\r\n\r\nAs the old man was looking I explained to him, “You see, Mr. Millward,\r\nthe ship’s forefoot sticks up a little clear of the sand.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, that is true.”\r\n\r\n“And you will see that there is plenty of room there to drag the bight\r\nof a hawser well under the keel.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I see.”\r\n\r\n“Now look at the stern, and you will notice that it overhangs very much,\r\nand that the rudder has broken away and become detached.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, quite true,” said the old man; “and you could easily drag the\r\nbight of your second hawser under the projecting stern.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” I replied; “and then we shall have the old relic swung\r\nsecurely from two points, and come up she must if only her old ribs and\r\nbones are strong enough to stand the strain. She must float or break in\r\ntwo.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Morgan, we must and will succeed,” said the old man, excitedly.\r\n“That craft is to all appearance sound and strong. I have heard that\r\nwood when under water completely does not decay as when exposed to the\r\nair. We shall find her still strong enough to be raised.”\r\n\r\n“I trust so and believe so,” I replied.\r\n\r\nWhen the fair Alice came to look at the wonders of the deep through the\r\nglass her delight was extravagant.\r\n\r\n“Why,” she cried, “I can see the old cannon all covered with sea-weed.\r\nAnd what a strange, old-fashioned ship! Two cabins built one on top of\r\nthe other, and in front a sort of house. I can even see the doorway in\r\nthe cabin, and the funny little windows, and a fish swimming in at one\r\nof them as though he lived there. Shells are growing all over the whole\r\nvessel like lichens on a rock. What a lovely, horrible sight!”\r\n\r\nWhen we had spent an hour at this sight-seeing we cast off from the buoy\r\nand made sail for Plantation Cove, and very soon came abreast of it.\r\nFrom the sea, except for the break in the beach, the opening into the\r\ncove was scarcely distinguishable in the wall of the cliff, which here\r\ncame out in a sort of cape or headland. Just in this headland was the\r\ncleft. I wore round and ran straight in for the mouth of the cove, and\r\nfound water enough easily to cross the bar. We glided swiftly through\r\nthe rocky gate with the momentum, and floated out on the deep, quiet\r\nwaters of the cove, the breeze being entirely cut off by the cliff,\r\nexcept a faint, uncertain gust now and then, which found its way in as a\r\ndraught will sometimes blow down a chimney. There was just enough motion\r\nto carry us alongside the pier, which now at low tide stood high above\r\nus, so high that it would be impossible to get Mr. Millward on shore by\r\nits aid. For this reason I pulled the boat along until her nose was\r\nagainst the rocky shore at the side of the pier and made her temporarily\r\nfast, while I carried Mr. Millward on shore, and landed his daughter. I\r\nthen pulled back to a place where a rude ladder led from the pier down\r\nto the water, and moored the boat securely, head and stern, with\r\nsufficient line so that she might ride safely at all tides, then I\r\noverhauled the sail we had brought along for a tent, carried it ashore\r\nand set it up, built a rousing fire, and gathered a quantity of fern for\r\nbedding. As soon as the fire was started Alice set about warming up a\r\nbean porridge for supper, that we might have it early enough to visit\r\nthe plantation before dark.\r\n\r\nWe hurried through the supper, and then leaving Mr. Millward\r\ncomfortably seated in the armchair, I started with Alice for a little\r\nwalk up to the rising ground to show her a view of the orange grove and\r\nplantation buildings which could be seen from this side. Along the old\r\nroad, a great part of which was overgrown with weeds and straggling\r\nvolunteer plants from the various crops that had formerly been\r\ncultivated here: Indian-corn, tall, tasselled sugar-cane, pink-blossomed\r\ntobacco, with great, velvety leaves and up-shooting stalk, an occasional\r\ndried cotton plant with shreds of cotton still clinging to the brown\r\nbolls, yams run wild and growing in broad green bands of fleshy vine\r\nacross the path in tropical luxuriance,--these and countless wild weeds\r\nand plants not only filled the fields but trenched upon the road.\r\n\r\nBefore we reached a point at which the groves and houses could well be\r\nseen Miss Millward had already gathered a great armful of samples to\r\ncarry back to the tent that her father might see them. We went along up\r\nthe road until we came to the remains of a gate,--two upright stones\r\nroughly resembling pillars, and having iron hinge-pieces let into one of\r\nthem. The gate itself had been thrown down at one side. Here we were in\r\nfull sight of all the buildings, and of the grove of fruit trees. I left\r\nher here a few moments while I waded through the weeds to gather a bunch\r\nof bananas, some of which were ripe and red. As I came back I saw her\r\nbeckon to me to hasten; and I ran as fast as I could, until I reached\r\nher side.\r\n\r\n“Listen,” said she, “I thought just now I heard a cry.”\r\n\r\nWe listened a moment, and then I heard distinctly, from the direction of\r\nthe cove, her father’s voice as though calling for help.\r\n\r\n“It is father calling us,” she cried, and immediately began running down\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\nI threw down my bunch of bananas and soon passed her, impeded as she was\r\nwith her skirts and the weeds. I plunged through the last heavy growth\r\nof weeds and canes that separated me from a clear view of the tent, and\r\nwas thunderstruck to behold a man coming toward us from that direction.\r\nAt first I thought of the pearl-fishers, and feared that violence had\r\nperhaps already been done to the helpless Mr. Millward, whose voice we\r\nhad just heard calling for assistance. My first impulse was to turn back\r\nand stop Miss Millward, whom I could hear struggling through the weeds\r\nbehind me. But in a moment I was still more astonished to recognize in\r\nthe approaching figure Mr. Millward himself! I do not believe I should\r\nhave been more surprised to have seen a dead man rise and walk. I had\r\nnever seen him, you will remember, otherwise than helpless, and my mind\r\nwas completely habituated so to regard him. Now here he was, upright and\r\nwalking with apparent firmness toward me. I was inexpressibly\r\nastonished, and for the moment quite speechless. I stood there with open\r\nmouth staring at him when Miss Millward came panting through the weeds\r\nto my side.\r\n\r\n“Father! oh, father!” she cried, and without a moment’s pause hurried on\r\nas fast as she could to meet him. Collecting my own wits I speedily\r\nfollowed her. When they met she fell upon the old man’s breast and began\r\nto sob out, “Oh, what is the matter? Oh, why did you call?”\r\n\r\nShe had evidently forgotten, or failed to comprehend for the moment,\r\nthat there was anything surprising in the fact that he was up and\r\nwalking about. This oversight was doubtless due to the fact that, unlike\r\nmyself, she had been long accustomed to see him walk, and the helpless\r\ncondition was the one she was least accustomed to. However, without\r\nendeavoring to analyze our relative feelings of surprise, let us listen\r\nto the curious account given by Mr. Millward of his sudden recovery of\r\nthe use of his lower limbs.\r\n\r\n“After you had left me,” he said, “I was sitting comfortably in the\r\narmchair looking at you until you disappeared among the vegetation.\r\nPresently I became aware that a little breeze had risen and was driving\r\nthe smoke of the fire toward me. This was disagreeable, but as it could\r\nnot be helped I quietly endured it, thinking it would not be for long,\r\nand that you would be back soon. But very soon thereafter I found the\r\ndry fern all around me on fire, and fearing I should roast to death I\r\ntwice called as loudly as I could, hoping you would hear me in time. The\r\nflames, however, came very fast, my chair caught fire, my hands were\r\nslightly scorched, and I was at the same time smothering with the smoke.\r\nI sprang up and put out the fire with the blanket which you had wrapped\r\naround my limbs. Then finding I could walk, I started to meet you. That\r\nis all. God in his merciful providence has restored me.”\r\n\r\nThat was all. But it was quite enough. We turned back and walked\r\ntogether to the tent I could not get used to it. That this man whom I\r\nleft helpless in his chair less than half an hour before, should now be\r\nactually standing firm on his feet, and walking about, as though nothing\r\nhad been the matter with him, was entirely too much for my practical,\r\nmatter-of-fact mind. Mr. Millward evidently noticed my bewildered air,\r\nand laughing said: “Rest easy, Mr. Morgan, I believe this recovery will\r\nbe permanent. The excitement of the sudden danger must have roused my\r\ntorpid nerves, and did suddenly for me what doubtless would have taken\r\nplace a few weeks later in a slower way. Now let us thank God with all\r\nour hearts for this mercy.”\r\n\r\nThe delight of the daughter, when she realized the pleasant truth was\r\nvery touching indeed; she wept, embraced him, and patted him with her\r\nhands, cooing and sobbing and laughing all at once, while the old man in\r\nsilence passed his hand gently from time to time over her beautiful\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nFrom the scattered embers I rebuilt the fire, and after the sun went\r\ndown, we all three sat in front of it talking over this strange\r\noccurrence. Intervals of silence would now and then fall upon us\r\nunbroken for several minutes. It was very hard indeed to realize the\r\nremarkable change. Perhaps the most curious thing was the effect\r\nproduced upon Duke. The dog eyed Mr. Millward with an air of such\r\nludicrous doubt, edging away from him, and then coming back wagging his\r\ntail to be patted, that we could not refrain from laughing heartily at\r\nhis conduct. He resented our merriment with a sheepish,\r\ntail-between-legs air that only made us laugh the more.\r\n\r\nLeaving the father and daughter to sleep in the tent, Duke and I went\r\ndown to the boat. There, gently rocked by the incoming tide, I slumbered\r\npeacefully through the night until long after dawn, and was then\r\nawakened by the old man’s hand laid gently on my shoulder. It was time\r\nfor breakfast, which we made of oranges and plantains, the latter baked\r\nin the hot ashes. Mr. Millward had already been clear to the plantation\r\nbuildings and returned with this spoil. He was still weak and feeble.\r\nThat after his long inactivity his muscles should have strength enough\r\nfor him to walk about at all, was, in truth, matter of surprise, even\r\nnot considering the recent paralysis. The possession of so much physical\r\nvigor was doubtless due to the continued and regular rubbing and massage\r\ntreatment he had received.\r\n\r\nIt was thought best, now that we were here with the boat, to collect and\r\ntake back with us as much as we could conveniently carry of the produce\r\nof the groves and plantations. One thing Mr. Millward was specially\r\ndesirous of getting was a good supply of coffee-berries, which we might\r\ncure in the usual manner by drying them in the shade, and thus finally\r\nget the kernels for use. Oranges would also keep well; and bananas and\r\nplantains would ripen even better in the bunch hung up at home than upon\r\nthe tree. So, too, there was needed sweet-potatoes and yams, and a good\r\nsupply of tobacco for curing. With shovel and hoe and improvised baskets\r\nmade of huge plantain leaves we went to work, digging and gathering and\r\ncarrying,--Miss Alice and I doing the chief part of the work, while Mr.\r\nMillward, feeling somewhat feeble and exhausted, was content to stroll\r\nabout a little or to rest in the shade. Wandering about among the\r\nouthouses he came across a setting hen on a nest of fifteen eggs, and\r\nbrought in hen, nest, and eggs all together, the devoted bird\r\ncourageously allowing herself to be captured rather than leave the nest.\r\nThis prize we stowed in the cuddy-hole of the boat, shutting her and her\r\nbeloved nest in safety together.\r\n\r\nI found an old, dilapidated fanning-mill, and a small grindstone mounted\r\nin a frame with a crank to turn it. Anything of this sort I thought\r\nmight be useful to me in contriving my rope machinery; so I loaded it on\r\nthe boat.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the afternoon we got on board, and after sculling\r\nthe boat out over the bar set sail for Home Creek, where we arrived\r\nsafely about five o’clock. While supper was being made ready I built a\r\nsafe coop for the old hen, with sticks driven into the ground, and put\r\nher with her nest into it, giving her corn and a gourd of water, and\r\nleft her to hatch her brood if she chose. We were all very tired that\r\nnight and went early to bed.\r\n\r\nThe next day Mr. Millward and I went to work to contrive some sort of\r\ndevice for spinning the cocoa-husk fibre into rope-yarn. The old\r\nfanning-mill came very handily into play in this job. The fan was geared\r\nto run at a high rate of speed, and by disconnecting the sieves and\r\nshakers and taking off the fan blades, this final piece of shafting\r\ncould be made to revolve at a rattling gait by a comparatively slow\r\nmotion of the crank, and with very little expenditure of force. We\r\nturned the old machine up on one end and mounted it on stilts to bring\r\nthe final or fan shaft into convenient position. Then on the end of the\r\nfan shaft we mounted the spinning device, whittled out of hard wood and\r\npieces of cane. This consisted primarily of a spool about a foot in\r\nlength mounted in a framework so that its axis would be at right angles\r\nto the fan shaft. The revolution of the fan shaft would now cause the\r\nspool to revolve with an end-over-end movement; so that a piece of cord,\r\nif one end were tied or wound upon the spool, would be twisted. The next\r\nthing was to contrive some method for causing the spool to rotate\r\nautomatically on its own axis at a slower rate, so as to wind up the\r\ncord as fast as it was twisted by the other motion of the spool at a\r\nhigh rate of speed.\r\n\r\nThis movement cost us an almost indescribable amount of the closest and\r\nhardest thought. To complete the machine up to this point took only two\r\ndays. Then we stuck fast for a whole week debating the matter and trying\r\ncontrivances which would not work, and which, when they came to trial it\r\nseemed as though we should have known would not work, so complete and\r\nhumiliating was their failure. Finally we changed the whole structure by\r\nmounting the spool loosely on the end of the fan shaft itself with its\r\naxis coincident with the axis of the shaft, fitting the spool to run by\r\nfriction on the shaft, while the frame which led the yarn to the spool\r\nwas rigidly fixed on the same shaft. Now the rapid motion of the frame\r\nwould do the twisting and the cord would wind only as fast as it was\r\nfreely fed, the spool slipping at a commensurate rate on the shaft. This\r\nworked all right with a piece of cord already made; but whether it would\r\nmake the yarn out of unformed fibre was a matter to be determined by\r\ntrial. This trial we could not make until we had built a feeding-table\r\non which to pile the mass of fibre, fitted with a tube of cane to guide\r\nthe forming yarn to the twister-frame. When this was done the machine\r\nproved satisfactory and did the work it was designed to do rapidly and\r\nwell. It required two to work it,--one to turn the crank and thus\r\nfurnish the power, and the other to feed up and manipulate the fibre so\r\nthat it would be smoothly and properly interwoven with the twisting end\r\nof the forming filament.\r\n\r\nThe construction of this rude machine took us ten days of hard study and\r\nwork. But when it was done we had taken a long step in advance. When we\r\nlearned it would work we celebrated the occasion by twisting a spoolful\r\nof yarn, about a hundred yards,--I turning the crank, with the sweat of\r\nhonest toil dripping from me, while Mr. Millward fed in the fibre. This\r\nyarn, which was quite firmly spun, we doubled, and allowed it to twist\r\ntogether upon itself making a stout cord nearly fifty yards in length\r\nand of the size of signal halyard stuff. It was strong and firm, and as\r\nwe judged would easily stand a strain of fifty pounds without breaking.\r\nThat it was not absolutely smooth and even, was a matter of\r\ncomparatively small consequence, the vital thing being strength and\r\ncompactness.\r\n\r\nTo say that we were both delighted with the result of our labors, is\r\nonly faintly to express the real condition of mind with which we hailed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAlice Millward had come down to see the trial of the machine, and was a\r\nwitness of the making of the first piece of cord, and we all joined\r\ntogether in the rejoicing.\r\n\r\nNow began a period of steady, hard work, manufacturing rope. We first\r\nrigged up the machine under the shed, so that we might have protection\r\nfrom the sun and the rain, and then set to work, regularly each day,\r\nexcepting of course on the sabbath day, during which we always rested\r\nand held divine service at least once. We divided the working day as\r\nfollows: from breakfast until nine o’clock we spent gathering husks\r\nenough for the whole day’s work, bringing them to the shed and pounding\r\nup and separating sufficient of the fibre for a run of half an hour.\r\nPromptly at nine o’clock I took the crank and began a steady half-hour’s\r\ngrind; then to give my muscles a change we would go again at pounding\r\nand separating fibre for half an hour; then came another half-hour at\r\nthe crank, and so on until the blessed hour of noon arrived, when we\r\nwould take dinner and rest until one o’clock; then hard at it again,\r\nrain or shine, until five o’clock.\r\n\r\nMr. Millward could sit at his feeding work and was thus able to endure\r\nit; but it was doubtless very hard for him, though he never uttered a\r\ncomplaint and seemed to thrive on it. My work at the crank was very hard\r\nindeed, and at first when night came every bone and muscle in my whole\r\nbody would ache with the strain. As the days went by, however, the work\r\ngrew easier and easier day by day, until I felt it no longer as a strain\r\nupon me.\r\n\r\nAt five o’clock we set to work getting up the necessary fuel and doing\r\nthe chores about the house, and such little things as Alice wanted\r\nattended to. Exactly at six o’clock Alice, who carried the watch, would\r\ncome out and call us in for supper, to which two tired men were sure to\r\ndo justice, especially to the hot coffee which we now had at each meal\r\nin plenty. After supper we generally sat on the porch talking over\r\nvarious matters of interest. Mr. Millward, who when a younger man had\r\nspent ten years as a missionary in India and South Africa, related many\r\ninteresting reminiscences of his life in those strange countries: of\r\ndesperate fights with savages in resisting forays; of hunts for game and\r\nencounters with wild beasts; of the rude forms of worship and\r\nsuperstitions of the African tribes, and the complex religion of the\r\nHindoos. His memory was wonderfully accurate and stored with countless\r\nincidents, curious, strange, and interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nLOST AND FOUND.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn about two weeks a brood of twelve chickens was hatched out, and the\r\nold hen fastened in the coop made no end of clucking and\r\nfeather-ruffling in her anxiety that the fluffy, yellow-feathered little\r\ninnocents should come to no harm. They ran in and out between the bars\r\nat pleasure, and very soon made friends with their mistress Alice, who\r\ncould, or thought she could, distinctly recognize each of the little\r\nbrothers and sisters, and distinguish one from another. In proof of this\r\nshe named one after each of the twelve months of the year. By feeding\r\nthem every day she soon got the whole brood so that it would come at\r\ncall, and some of the chicks would frequently jump into her lap, or eat\r\nfrom her hand in a perfectly fearless manner. It was pleasant to hear\r\nher talk to her little pets and call them by name. The one she called\r\nApril was a feeble little yellow chick, much put upon and driven about\r\nby the others, especially by the stout-legged, fluffy, brown ball named\r\nOctober, which seemed to be ever on the watch to snatch a bug or worm\r\nfrom the weakling.\r\n\r\n“Now you bad, bad October,” I one time overheard her say, “I shall\r\ncertainly have to lock you up, if you do not let April’s bugs alone. You\r\nselfish little creature, you drop a nice, fat worm of your own to snatch\r\na bitter little bug away from poor April, and when you get it you don’t\r\nlike it. Serves you quite right, and April has got your worm and run\r\naway with it, too. Why, December, I do believe you are losing the\r\nbeautiful stripes on your back. Come, June; come, September, and you\r\ntoo, August. There, there,--no fighting; brethren should dwell together\r\nin unity.” Her father called the brood her Sunday-school class, and\r\nremarked with a smile, “Girls are all alike; they must have something to\r\nlove and pet, and the more helpless it is the better they like it.”\r\n\r\nThe work of rope-yarn-making went steadily on day by day, the pile of\r\nthe product of our labor growing by slow accretion, until it was a great\r\nheap. This was such very tedious work that you may be sure I kept up a\r\nsteady thinking all the while how to lessen and lighten it. I thought of\r\ntwo schemes before long that would very materially diminish the amount\r\nof rope-yarn required. The first of these schemes to take form in my\r\nmind related to a substitute for the two great hawsers which we had\r\nthought would be required, one to go under the bow and one under the\r\nstern of the sunken galleon. I said nothing about this idea until it was\r\nfully matured in my mind. Then one day as I finished a half-hour’s\r\ngrind, with the perspiration streaming from every pore and the breath\r\nabout all gone from my body, I said:--\r\n\r\n“Mr. Millward, what do you say to quitting for the day? It is now nearly\r\nnoon. I feel as though I would like to go fishing.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at me a moment, and then replied, “I don’t wonder. I feel that\r\nway myself. If you are for a fishing excursion I am with you with all my\r\nheart. ‘All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.’”\r\n\r\nImmediately after dinner we overhauled the fish lines--real ones with\r\ngenuine hooks this time, which belonged to Mr. Millward’s stores--and\r\ncollecting a supply of whelks, clams, and shrimps for bait, were all\r\nready for embarking by the time Alice came down to the boat. Just\r\nbeyond the bar and the rollers we anchored the boat, and the sport very\r\nsoon began by Mr. Millward pulling up a fine red-snapper, and continued\r\nuntil we had caught half a dozen fine fish. Then they ceased to bite for\r\na long time, and the cause was made apparent by Miss Alice hauling up a\r\nthree-foot spotted shark, which managed to break the line and get away.\r\nBut though after that we sat patiently for an hour or two, there were no\r\nmore fish to be had. The pirate was cruising about, and honest fish were\r\nnot out in that neighborhood.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Millward,” said I after a spell of silence, uninterrupted by bites,\r\n“I think we are done making rope, or nearly so at last.”\r\n\r\n“Why, we are not half done, according to a liberal estimate,” replied\r\nhe, looking up in surprise. “We have barely enough rope for the gourds,\r\nto say nothing of the much greater quantity needed for the two four-inch\r\nhawsers.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said I, “suppose we don’t need the hawsers? I have an idea that\r\nit will be much easier to build a framework of beams strong enough to\r\nlift the hulk by, and thus dispense with the hawsers. At any rate even\r\nif it took almost the same amount of work--and it will not--I would\r\nfavor a change of labor. The rope-making is getting very monotonous.”\r\n\r\n“I most certainly agree with you in that,” he replied; “it does seem an\r\nendless task. But tell me how you propose to construct and attach your\r\nframework.”\r\n\r\nThereupon I laid it out in diagram on the seat of the boat with the\r\npoint of my knife, and explained it until both understood the plan. They\r\nwere intensely interested. Alice was leaning over with her hand upon my\r\nshoulder looking and listening, and as I felt her breath fan my cheek I\r\ncame to a dead stop. The old gentleman looked up from the rude diagram\r\nand said, “Well, go on, go on; I understand it thus far,--what next?”\r\n\r\nThis seemed to bring the situation to Alice’s mind, for she\r\ninstinctively blushed, and gently drew away. My heart beat with a thump\r\nthat I could almost hear; but the old man did not seem to notice my\r\nconfusion nor the innocent action of the girl. He was bent intently on\r\nunderstanding the proposed plan which promised to shorten our dreary\r\nyarn-making task, and had no eyes or ears for anything else.\r\n\r\nRecovering myself I went on with the explanation of the diagram. I\r\nshowed how we might make two triangular frames of heavy beams or spars\r\nfirmly joined, how these two frames might be connected together at the\r\napex of each by a long beam or spar in such manner as to be distant from\r\neach other something less than the length of the galleon; how the\r\nconnection between the long beam and the two triangles should be a\r\nflexible or jointed one, so that, as the whole structure, suitably\r\nweighted with stones, was lowered to the galleon the triangles could be\r\nheld away, and then allowed to swing in toward the galleon and come\r\nunder her head and stern, thus cradling the hulk in a support at each\r\nend which would become more secure when a strain was subsequently put\r\nupon the frame. The calabashes for lifting could be attached to the\r\nhorizontal connecting beam and thus a proper distribution of the strain\r\nensured without trouble. After careful consideration Mr. Millward said\r\nthis scheme would do. We then discussed the amount of work required for\r\nthe building, conveying and placing of such a framework, as compared\r\nwith the work which would be required to make the two large hawsers; and\r\nafter mature deliberation decided in favor of the framework, as far the\r\nbest and quickest method.\r\n\r\nThe fishing was over for the time. No more bites, and no prospect of\r\nany. So we pulled up anchor and went in to dress the fish and make\r\npreparation for a grand chowder, to be compounded of yams, fish, red\r\npepper, and a clove of wild garlic. When this was in the kettle and the\r\nkettle over the fire (we all three took a hand in its preparation) Mr.\r\nMillward and I began to overhaul the rope-yarn, to make an estimate of\r\nhow much, if any, more would be needed, in view of the recent change of\r\nplan. It was at this time that I conceived the second scheme. It\r\noccurred to me that a good deal of rope might be spared if we could\r\nenclose each calabash, or bunch of calabashes, in a wicker cage made of\r\nwillow branches. I suggested this, and we went at once to the willows\r\nand cut some slender wands, and made such a cage as I had in mind, out\r\nof fine wands and tied with bark. This cage securely enclosed four\r\ncalabashes; as the wires of a lantern-guard enclose the globe, and at\r\nthe same time afforded a ready means for attaching the rope without\r\nwasting any of its length in loops and bends about the calabashes. This\r\nscheme would save at least one fourth to one third of the amount of rope\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nWe estimated that four of the large calabashes would lift in the water\r\nas much as the strength of the rope employed would permit, or at least\r\nwould be as much as we cared to attempt to pull down at once into the\r\nwater. The trees that furnished the wands were plentiful along the lower\r\npart of the creek, and there would be no lack of osiers. I have spoken\r\nof these trees as being “willows;” but, in truth, I believe they were\r\nsome species of water-loving oleander. They were, however, quite like\r\nwillow in appearance and growth, and furnished abundance of long,\r\nslender branches, pliable and strong, with a bark that easily came off\r\nand was itself quite strong enough to tie the joints with. I believe\r\nthis tree is a better one for basket-makers’ use than the common osier\r\nwillow, though I do not know if it is ever used for that purpose.\r\n\r\nIt was with heartfelt satisfaction that we could now believe that enough\r\nrope was made, and that the daily monotonous grind which had been going\r\non for weeks was at last over. Nor was the basket-work in caging the\r\ngourds likely to be of a trying character, as it was light, easy work,\r\nin which we could all engage at any time, rain or shine, and enliven\r\nwith talk.\r\n\r\nThe very day after this Mr. Millward and I began to cut the osiers. We\r\ntied them in bundles of a hundred or more, and put them into the water\r\nto keep from drying out until used. When we had quite a large stock on\r\nhand we began each evening after supper to make the cages, enclosing\r\nfour of the gourds, now quite dry and hard, in each cage.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, as regular work for each day, we began the\r\nconstruction of the framework. For this we needed seven great spars,\r\nwhich had to be cut on the upland from a species of pine which grew\r\nthere, trimmed to the required shape on the ground, and from thence got\r\ndown to the sea.\r\n\r\nWe selected the trees as near the creek as possible, and by means of\r\nlevers rolled them into the water, which was barely deep enough to float\r\nsuch great sticks. The labor was a great deal for two men to accomplish,\r\none being old and feeble. It took us every working day for three weeks\r\nto get these timbers down to the mouth of the creek. But it was finally\r\ndone, and then commenced the framing together of the two triangles and\r\ntheir attachment to the beam. This we did with ties of strong inch and\r\na half rope in several turns. At last, the complete structure lay\r\nfloating in the creek ready to be towed out to the galleon.\r\n\r\nWhile we were at work getting out the timbers on the upland it happened\r\nnearly every day that Alice Millward would either go with us in the\r\nmorning or come out at noon bringing a lunch to us of hot baked yams and\r\nbacon, and so go home with us at night; or when I had wet work in the\r\ncreek, following down a launched timber, she would return with her\r\nfather in advance. We always went to this work quite early in the\r\nmorning and returned home at least four hours before sunset, as the\r\ncage-making work demanded some of our time. On rainy days we did not go\r\nout at all, but kept busy with the basket-work.\r\n\r\nOne day it happened that at noon when we expected Alice with the lunch,\r\nshe did not come promptly as usual, and after waiting nearly an hour\r\nover time, we both became quite anxious to know why she did not arrive.\r\nI told Mr. Millward to wait where he was, to receive her if she came,\r\nwhile I went back to the house with Duke to see if she was there.\r\nHurrying along, the dog and I arrived in a little over half an hour at\r\nthe house, going by the shortest cut and as rapidly as possible, running\r\nindeed part of the way where the nature of the ground permitted. As I\r\nhad greatly feared, she was not there. Nothing indicated any\r\ndisturbance; everything was as we had left it in the morning, and I\r\nconcluded at once that she had started to come to us with the lunch, and\r\nhad either lost her way in the dense growth, or had received some hurt\r\non the road. The obvious thing to do under such circumstances was to\r\nfollow up the regular path which we customarily took, and which in my\r\nhaste to reach the house I had not pursued on my return, and to look for\r\ntraces of her on the way.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to a little glade where the candleberries grew plentifully I\r\nnoted a place where I thought it possible for her to have mistaken the\r\npath. Two conspicuous bushes, separated from each other by a distance of\r\nperhaps five rods and covered with vivid scarlet blossoms in great\r\nmasses, were on the opposite side of the glade. The way ran to the right\r\nhand side of the right hand bush. Now if she had taken a course to the\r\nright hand of the left hand bush, she would be travelling quite thirty\r\ndegrees away from the true direction. This was brought to my mind by the\r\ncircumstance that several times Miss Millward had come with these red\r\nblossoms in her hand, or decorated with them in hat or dress, probably\r\ngathered each time from the bush by the side of the route. I went over\r\nat once to the left hand bush, and found that a branch had been freshly\r\nbroken off. It was probable, therefore, that here was the place of\r\ndivergence from the true route. Without paying much attention at the\r\nmoment, Miss Millward had doubtless been misled by this false guide, and\r\nin passing had broken off a branch of the flowers as usual.\r\n\r\nThat this surmise was correct was evidenced a few paces further along by\r\nfresh leaves and twigs of the bush which she had thrown down after\r\nsecuring the coveted blossoms from the branch; and finally by the branch\r\nitself partly denuded of its blossoms. But beyond this I could find no\r\ntrace. Perhaps a skilled woodsman or tracker could have easily followed\r\nthe trail that no doubt existed, plainly enough marked for those who\r\ncould read it; but unfortunately I knew not how to read the subtle\r\nindications that are said to be so plain to those versed in that sort of\r\nwriting. I then tried to start the dog on the trail by leading him to a\r\npoint where I knew by inference it existed. But either he did not\r\nchoose to take up the scent, was unable to do so, or did not understand\r\nwhat I desired of him. At any rate he made no effort to follow the\r\ntrail.\r\n\r\nI then endeavored to reason out the probable course the girl had taken,\r\nby trying to conceive myself misled in the same manner. Suppose I had\r\ndiverged thirty degrees unconsciously to the left of the route, when\r\nshould I discover the error and what would be my course when I did\r\ndiscover it? By this method of imaginative analysis I was able to follow\r\nwith reasonable certainty her probable course through the forest for\r\nabout forty rods, which brought me to a dense jungle all interwoven with\r\nthorny bamboo and utterly impassable. There was nothing at all like this\r\non the true route, and at this point, if not before, and most probably\r\nat this exact place Alice Millward must have become conscious that she\r\nhad lost her way. Now the thing for me to determine was, what did she\r\nnext do? Most probably, finding herself lost, she at once sought to\r\nretrace her steps until she could arrive at some familiar place from\r\nwhich to take a fresh departure. If she had gone back to the glade she\r\nwould have found the blossoming bushes and probably from thence have\r\nbeen able to get a correct start. It was fair to infer, therefore, that\r\nshe must have missed the glade, passing it either on the right hand or\r\nthe left. But if she had passed it on the right hand the angle of such a\r\ncourse would have speedily brought her out into the open ground from\r\nwhich the sea and the beach, and possibly the house and shed were\r\nvisible, and she would have had no difficulty in getting home. Therefore\r\nthe inference was justifiable that in endeavoring to retrace her steps,\r\nthe girl had veered to the left hand; this would lead her to the heavy\r\ntimber that lines the creek in that direction.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I had reached this conclusion, I started immediately to tell\r\nher father of the situation. I soon reached him and found him very\r\nanxiously waiting my coming. I told him briefly where I thought she was\r\nnow probably wandering, and my reasons for the conjecture. It\r\nconsiderably eased his mind to be able to think she was merely lost.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that he should return to the house at once and await me\r\nthere, or after getting there come back up the creek to meet us, if I\r\nshould find her.\r\n\r\nWithout delay I started for the thick woods where I hoped to find the\r\ngirl. As soon as I was well into the heavy timber I began to shout at\r\nintervals every few minutes, and then listen for a reply; but none came,\r\nand I wandered in and about the forest in this manner for several hours,\r\nshouting until I was so hoarse that I could scarcely be heard ten rods\r\naway. Finally, when it was almost dark, I found her far up the creek,\r\nand almost to the cleft or chasm through which I had passed on the day I\r\ndiscovered the plantation. She was on the bank of the creek and coming\r\ndown toward me through the tangled undergrowth. I tried to call, but was\r\nso hoarse from the long continued shouting that I was not heard, and so\r\nshe did not see me until we were quite near each other.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Morgan,” she cried, with a voice full of tears, “I am so glad\r\nto find you!” Instinctively I put my arm around her and took her hand in\r\nmine.\r\n\r\n“Let us hurry on,” she resumed, “and find poor dear father, he must have\r\nbeen so anxious about me.”\r\n\r\nI told her he was waiting near the creek, or at the house for us and we\r\nwould soon be there, as it was not over an hour’s walk.\r\n\r\nShe was softly crying to herself, and apparently much shaken. She clung\r\nto my hand as though fearful of losing her guide. We walked on in the\r\nrapidly gathering dusk, and she became gradually more quiet and assured,\r\nso that she soon began to talk freely of her adventure. It seemed that\r\nshe had only just found the creek, and though, as she said, it seemed to\r\nrun in the wrong direction entirely, she had reasoned that if followed\r\ndown it would finally bring her home. She had just about determined to\r\ngo into the water and wade down the stream itself if the tangled growth\r\nbecame too thick on the banks, as it seemed quite likely would happen\r\nsoon, and as, indeed, was the case a little way on. I fancied the\r\ndistress of mind and body that this would have caused in the darkness\r\nnow fast coming on, and my heart grew soft and tender. I told her then\r\nof the way I came to find the route she had most probably taken, the\r\nincident of the red blossoms, and all the course of reasoning by which I\r\nwas led in the search.\r\n\r\nShe then took out of her dress the bunch of blossoms, and said, “Then it\r\nis to these flowers I owe this meeting?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said I, “to the gathering of those red blossoms. Don’t you think\r\nI have earned them as a reward?”\r\n\r\nWithout a word she handed me the bunch, glowing red as the sunset tints\r\nwhich yet marked the sky.\r\n\r\nSomehow I felt, as we stumbled along the darkening way, her hand clasped\r\nin mine as it rested on my arm, that our hearts had come nearer together\r\nthan I had ever dared before to hope might be the case, and my own heart\r\nwas filled with a wild, new-born hope. She seemed to be mine as I lifted\r\nher over the fallen logs, and helped her past the rocks and obstacles.\r\nIt very quickly grew quite dark, and it was no easy matter under such\r\ncircumstances to keep the right course, so that we could not talk even\r\nif either of us had felt a desire to do so. In silence we struggled\r\nalong, until finally we came out into the open. The sea with its\r\nwonderful self-light was plainly visible before us, and the ceaseless\r\nmurmur of the surf as it came to our ears was a most welcome sound. A\r\nbright fire built by her father to guide us shone like a beacon before\r\nus, reddening the palm-trees near the house. Soon we could see him\r\nstanding near it on the watch. And in a few minutes she was clasped in\r\nhis arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nA BAD PORT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the lifting-frame was complete, there was no reason why it should\r\nnot at once be floated out and secured in place at the sunken hulk as\r\nsoon as possible, and as the weather was very fine at that particular\r\ntime, and the water clear, we concluded to do it immediately. We took\r\nboth boats, Mr. Millward and Alice in his boat, and I alone in the\r\n“Mohawk.” With a line from the floating frame to each boat we towed it\r\nalong so easily and rapidly that in a couple of hours we were over the\r\nwreck. We anchored the two boats one at the bow and one at the stern of\r\nthe galleon, and pulling the floating frame between the two, fastened it\r\nsafely by a line at each end to the boat anchors. The next task was to\r\nget some heavy rocks with which to sink it, and attach them to the frame\r\nin such manner that when the latter was down in position to engage the\r\nwreck bow and stern, the rocks could be released to permit the frame to\r\nrise by its own power of flotation. It would then, we thought, be secure\r\nagainst displacement, as there was evidently very little, if any,\r\nmovement of the water at the depth the galleon lay. Leaving the frame\r\nattached to the anchor-lines we went to the north cape with the boats,\r\nand loaded on twelve stones of considerable weight, which we carried out\r\nand secured to the frame by slip-knots in such manner that by a pull\r\nfrom above on a rope each might be released.\r\n\r\nWhen the stones were attached we found that ten of them were just enough\r\nto sink the frame slowly. By means of a couple of ropes, one at each\r\nend of the frame, paid out from the two boats by Mr. Millward and me, we\r\nguided the contrivance in its descent until it landed exactly in place.\r\nAlice Millward with the water-glass watched the frame, and indicated to\r\nus how to manipulate the ropes. Thus she would call out, “Slowly, Mr.\r\nMorgan, a little more forward; a little more aft, father; now you are\r\ngoing right,” until it was in proper position. We then pulled the ropes\r\nattached to the stones, releasing the slip-knots two at a time to keep\r\nthe balance properly, and when relieved of this weight the frame floated\r\nup, enclosing and grasping the wreck at each end. This part of the work\r\nwas therefore successfully and easily completed.\r\n\r\nThe frame was in position, and it now only remained to attach the\r\ncalabashes, one cage of them at a time, and we hoped the galleon would\r\nbe lifted. In preparation for this work,--which we would not be ready to\r\nundertake for some time, or until all the calabashes were caged and\r\nfitted with attaching ropes,--we had, before sinking the frame-work,\r\npassed over the spar that connected the two triangles the bight of an\r\nendless rope, for use as a down-haul with which the calabash cages might\r\nbe pulled down. This endless down-haul line we proposed to hitch to a\r\nbuoy when we left, so that it might be supported within reach until\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\nBeing very anxious to test the working of my plan for pulling down and\r\nattaching the calabashes, I had brought along a single cage of them for\r\nthe purpose of trying the experiment of pulling it down and attaching it\r\nto the longitudinal spar. This scheme was a very simple one, and I\r\nsincerely hoped it would prove successful, as it had given me\r\nconsiderable study in its contrivance, and was, I thought, the best and\r\neasiest way to accomplish the result. The following description will\r\nmake it clear. To the cage holding the calabashes was attached a rope\r\nfour feet long. On the free end of this attaching rope was a hook made\r\nof a stout forked branch. Secured to the endless down-haul rope was a\r\nsimilar hook. By catching these hooks together, the cage could be pulled\r\ndown until the two hooks passed under the spar and came up on the other\r\nside. Now by crossing the down-haul rope the hook on the attaching rope,\r\nI thought, could be made to hook over that part of its own rope which\r\nwas on the other side of the spar. Then by reversing the pull on the\r\ndown-haul its hook would be released and the calabash cage be left\r\nattached to the spar by the stout rope passing around the spar and\r\nhooked to itself.\r\n\r\nThe experiment, to our great delight, was entirely successful and\r\nsatisfactory; and when we had fixed the down-haul rope securely to a\r\nbuoy we set sail and returned feeling highly encouraged at the outlook\r\nfor our labors.\r\n\r\nAs this business of pulling down and affixing the calabashes was likely\r\nto be a long and tedious job, to be successfully prosecuted only in good\r\nweather, we determined to begin it as soon as we could get a sufficient\r\nnumber of cages ready for a start; and thus we could work in suitable\r\nweather at the wreck attaching the cages, and in unsuitable weather at\r\nhome in preparing them for attachment. It would be only at the very last\r\nthat we need watch for the wreck to rise, and prepare for towing her in\r\nto shore. Until enough calabashes to float her had been sent down, such\r\nas were attached would of course be simply anchored to the wreck.\r\n\r\nIt was oppressively warm that evening after we had returned home, and we\r\nall brought our chairs down to the shed to better enjoy the slight\r\nbreeze which breathed in from the sea. We sat thus, watching the\r\nbreakers roll in through the dim light, and crash on the sand with a\r\nlong, running sound that passed from left to right along the beach, slow\r\nbut regular as heart-beats in their constant reiteration. Mr. Millward\r\nwas seated at a little distance from Alice and me enjoying his pipe, the\r\nfire in the bowl of which shone at intervals with a red glow, as though\r\nin rhythmic sympathy with the sound of the surf. The stars were bright\r\nand sprinkled all over the clear, dark sky, which was lit now and then\r\nby the long, fiery thread of a meteor ruled rapidly across the azure\r\ndome, and lingering as an impression on the retina long enough so that\r\nby turning the eye away the line of fire was transported to another\r\nquarter,--fading out, however, too fast for us to locate it distinctly.\r\n\r\nIt was a peaceful, quiet summer night, and we sat silent, enjoying\r\ntogether the restfulness of it. I looked at the dim outlines of Alice as\r\nshe sat by my side leaning her cheek upon one hand, and my heart was\r\nfilled with conscious depths of love and tenderness; then past her at\r\nthe shadowy figure of the old man and the intermittent glow of his pipe.\r\nA great peace seemed to possess my soul, a wonderful content of spirit,\r\nand I said to myself, “This is the peace of pure content and happiness.”\r\nOften since have I recalled that night, and felt that man, born to\r\ntrouble and sorrow on this earth,--beautiful though it be,--can hope for\r\nno greater bliss than such hours afford him. Happy hours come not at\r\ncall, nor often, nor long remain. Satisfied ambition brings them not,\r\nnor gratified pride, nor gathered wealth; but they come only when there\r\nis united this trinity of conditions: rest from labor done, the healthy\r\nbody, the presence of those we love. When these three things are united,\r\nthe peaceful, happy hour will come. And when this sweet angel of peace\r\nshall hover over you, drive it not away, my friend, by taking troubled\r\nthought of the morrow, nor by grieving over the past, nor regretting\r\nopportunities missed. Enjoy it in contented silence while you may, and\r\nwith little thought of past or future.\r\n\r\nAn unusually brilliant meteor shot in a long diagonal line from the\r\nzenith nearly to the horizon, and there burst in a ball of fire like a\r\nrocket. Alice laid her hand on my arm as though to call my attention,\r\nbut without a word. The touch was light; the little hand remained but a\r\nmoment on my arm, and was then as gently withdrawn. But, light and\r\nmomentary, it thrilled me through and through; the angel of peace took\r\ninstant flight, and thought came back with a rush. The restless fear\r\nthat we might be parted; that she could never love me; the instinctive\r\nwish to know with certainty her heart; a thousand contending emotions\r\nstirred me. With all my will I strove to calm myself and still the wild\r\nbeating of my heart. What strange power was this which the girl had\r\nacquired over me, that a mere touch of her hand sufficed to banish\r\nquiet, fill my brain with teeming fancies and my breast with longing and\r\nunrest? The quiet stars still shone as before, the surf still fell in\r\nmeasured cadence, the gentle, rustling breeze still fanned my cheek with\r\nits soft, cool breath; but peace and quiet and rest had departed. My\r\nsoul was fevered, and anxiety preyed once more upon my heart.\r\n\r\nThe night-blooming cereus had unfolded its waxen, white flowers, and the\r\nwarm air was laden with its strange, sweet perfume mingling with the\r\nfragrance of the dew-moistened foliage. Now there stole up out of the\r\nverge of the sea the thin, pale crescent of the young moon, a mere\r\nrounded line of silver tilted back as though reclining in its new\r\nfeebleness, and giving but little more light than the brilliant lamp of\r\nVenus that hung, a point of corruscating splendor, near it.\r\n\r\nAgain, as the silver horn emerged from the dim horizon line, I felt the\r\nsoft touch of her hand upon my arm, and in low tones she said, “Is it\r\nnot beautiful?”\r\n\r\nFor answer I took the hand in mine. Cool and soft it felt to my fevered\r\ngrasp. She withdrew it not, but, passive, let it lie for a few minutes.\r\nSome say that souls while still embodied do and can communicate with\r\neach other in some occult and mysterious way. If that be true, then\r\nsurely my soul must then and there have greeted Alice Millward’s.\r\n\r\nMr. Millward, who had once or twice nodded over his pipe, now rose and\r\nknocking out the ashes reminded us that it was time to go to bed; and he\r\nand Alice retired to the house. As I had no fancy to be shut up in-doors\r\non such a night, I brought my hammock down to the shed and swung it\r\nthere where the sound of the sea would lull me to sleep, while the\r\nbreeze fanned by with its cool breath.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we went diligently to work caging the calabashes in\r\nsets of four, rigging each cage with its short attaching rope and hook.\r\nThe hooks I cut with axe and knife from the bushes of the nearest\r\njungle. The work was congenial and light. Under the shed we arranged\r\nsome tussocks of dried grass so that we could be seated low down; and\r\nthus ranged in a sociable triangle we worked, chatted, laughed, and\r\njoked; the old gentleman revived his experiences of former years; and\r\naltogether it was a very pleasant time. Whenever the weather was\r\nfavorable we would load the completed cages of calabashes on board Mr.\r\nMillward’s boat, and all three of us would sail to the galleon and sink\r\nand attach them one at a time, in the manner already indicated.\r\n\r\nLittle by little the great pile of calabashes near the shed diminished\r\nuntil it was nearly gone. We had attached literally thousands of the\r\ngourds to the framework which grasped the wreck, until now when we\r\nlooked through the water-glass the hull was no longer visible, by reason\r\nof the mass of caged gourds sunk far under water, each one of course\r\npulling upwards to the full extent of its buoyancy. Still we kept on. I\r\nbegan to think that I should have to make another trip to the calabash\r\ntrees. But it was not to be so.\r\n\r\nOne morning we arrived at the galleon with a huge load in both boats\r\nwhich we had got ready during the two preceding days. We had not pulled\r\nhalf of them down when I felt the hauling-line slacken in my hand. Now I\r\nhad fully expected this very thing sometime to take place; but when it\r\ndid occur I thought for the moment that the line had frayed and parted,\r\nand did not realize that the hull was rising. Then as suddenly I\r\nunderstood, and shouted to Mr. Millward to cast off his boat from the\r\nbuoy, as the wreck was rising, and suiting the action to the word did\r\nthe same for my boat. We had no sooner cast loose than slowly the gourds\r\nlifted their heads in a confused mass to the surface, rattling and\r\nknocking together in the swell. The water all about became dark with\r\nooze and sand and fragments of weed stirred up from the ocean’s bed. I\r\nfelt sure that the old hull was floating beneath in the frame, because,\r\nthough I could not see it on account of the condition of the water, I\r\nknew that had the framework let go, its beams would have floated up and\r\nwould now be in view among the floating gourds.\r\n\r\nAt the sight Mr. Millward jumped upon the gunwale of his little schooner\r\nand waving his hat began a cheer, in which we all joined. The old hulk\r\nfloated at last! Its long rest was broken and a new voyage begun.\r\n\r\nBy a piece of sheer good-luck it so happened that the tide was coming in\r\nand nearly at the flood, the swell was setting to the land, and moreover\r\nthe little breeze there was came from the right quarter to drift the\r\nwreck in to the point of rocks. Everything was favorable to success in\r\nbeaching the galleon there.\r\n\r\nIn the greatest imaginable excitement we hastened to get the\r\nhauling-line on board the schooner, and securing both boats to it made\r\nall sail and endeavored thus to help the old hulk along by towing. It\r\nwas sluggish business. The boats would rise and fall with the swell and\r\nlean down to the breeze, then come up, the sails empty, and then down\r\nagain, and so on. But we moved, and in the right direction, though\r\nslowly, very slowly at first, and then a little faster as the rattling\r\nmass of gourds and the heavy load beneath it got fairly under way.\r\n\r\nI never saw Mr. Millward so wrought up with excitement as at this time.\r\nAnd indeed we were all in something of the same condition. For here was\r\nthe result of long labor culminating before our eyes. Small wonder,\r\nthen, that there should be much hilarity. The galleon was afloat, and\r\nour ship was coming in! Halfway to the beach Mr. Millward, in a sweet\r\nand powerful voice, rolled out that good old hymn, “We are going home,”\r\nand back from the rocks came the echo of the last word, “to-morrow.” We\r\nall joined heartily in the chorus, with the best of good-will.\r\n\r\nIn about an hour, and as near as could be at high tide the Spanish\r\ngalleon grounded between two rocks on a sandy bottom just at the north\r\ncape of the island, and we beached my boat near by in a sheltered place\r\nto the southwest of the cape. The other boat we sailed down to the\r\ncreek, got something to eat, put the axe and some other things on board,\r\nand came back to the cape, where we anchored to await the falling of the\r\ntide.\r\n\r\nAs we sat in the boat lifted by the swell, and watched each wave wash\r\nthrough between the rocks where lay the galleon, I began to realize that\r\nMr. Millward’s spirited song about “going home to-morrow” was not very\r\nlikely to come true for a good many to-morrows. There was a regular\r\ntide-way through this passage, and I began to doubt whether the sea had\r\nnot played us a sad trick in bringing the galleon to such a port.\r\n\r\nThat the situation of affairs may be better understood, it will be\r\nnecessary to describe precisely the lay of the land. The two rocks were\r\nseparated from each other by a narrow passage about thirty feet in width\r\nat the end where the galleon entered, and narrowed to perhaps ten feet\r\nat the other end in a length of a hundred and fifty feet. Through this\r\npassage the swell washed with great force. Indeed, the galleon and its\r\nsupporting mass of gourds had been carried in on the heave of the swell\r\nand the hull dropped there with a crash on the bottom. The frame-work\r\nand cages had been at once torn loose, and the spars and gourds lay\r\njammed in the narrow exit beyond, the water churned to foam by the\r\nobstruction they offered, dashing continually against them and tearing\r\nthem one by one loose from one another until the sea all beyond was\r\nlittered with the fragments.\r\n\r\nEven as we watched, this débris little by little washed out and away.\r\nThe hull of the galleon, it is true, lying on the bottom and well under\r\nwater where at high tide it was full five and twenty feet in depth,\r\nwould suffer no such damage probably in the present state of the\r\nweather. But on the other hand the fall of the tide would most likely\r\nnot be great enough to leave her above water, and there was no telling\r\nwhat might happen if a gale of wind should come along, especially with a\r\nlow tide. Indeed I speedily made up my mind that there was not only\r\ngoing to be great danger of the wreck breaking up and getting away from\r\nus entirely by washing piecemeal out through the exit into the sea, but\r\nalso, if this dire misfortune should be long delayed, that we should not\r\nbe able to get at the cargo for the racing of the water, even when at\r\nits lowest. I must confess that when this fully dawned on me I felt\r\ngreatly discouraged.\r\n\r\nAt last after a weary wait the tide reached its lowest, and as I feared,\r\nwe found that we dared not go into the race-way with the boat. Each\r\nswell swept through it with a great rush, breaking into foam in the\r\nnarrower part, so that a boat would have been dashed to pieces unless\r\nfortunate enough to swim fairly out through the exit, and would then be\r\nextremely liable to be overwhelmed. We drew up to the rock which lay\r\nadjoining the beach and landed, so that we might look down on the\r\ngalleon from above. There she lay with the deck just awash at the\r\nwater’s surface, except when a green sea came whelming through, and then\r\nshe was buried to the depth of several feet. The old hulk was a most\r\nvenerable and curious sight; shells of various kinds grown fast all over\r\nher ancient deck and sides; long streamers of sea-weed floating from her\r\nlike hair; coral branches, sand, ooze, mud,--a thousand reminiscences of\r\nher long sleep on the bottom were now plainly observable in the light of\r\nday.\r\n\r\nWe all three stood looking down upon this curious sight in silence,\r\nwhich was finally broken by Mr. Millward, saying,--\r\n\r\n“I am afraid we are as far away from the treasure that lies in that old\r\nship as we were before we raised her.”\r\n\r\nI did not feel like talking about it, and therefore said nothing, but\r\nstood with hands in pockets looking at this exhibition of what I\r\nregarded as the perversity of inanimate matter. That the bewitched old\r\ngalleon should have run her nose exactly into this place of all others,\r\nwhen there were miles of fair sloping beach on which she might have\r\nstranded, seemed like a deadly stab in the back by a treacherous adverse\r\nfate. It was enough to make a man swear, if that would have done any\r\ngood. And possibly it might have eased my feelings temporarily if I had\r\npossessed talent enough in that direction to have done full justice to\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nThis would have been a good time to give up the whole project,--to wash\r\nmy hands of all Spanish galleons in general and this perverse one in\r\nparticular. But I must say that no such thought entered my mind. I was\r\ndisgusted, and very much disappointed, and not a little angry; but as\r\nfor giving up, that was simply impossible. The situation stunned me, and\r\nthere seemed no way out of it; but I could not entertain the thought\r\nthat the recovery of the treasure was impossible.\r\n\r\nAlice Millward came up and drew me away by the arm. “Do not look so\r\ndowncast,” said she. “Surely we need not grieve over this failure. If we\r\ncannot get the treasure we are no worse off than we were yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“But you do not know,” said I, fiercely, “what it means to me. I have\r\nbeen working to save my birthplace.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind, never mind, Mr. Morgan,” replied she, gently, “let us go\r\nhome to the house now and think it all over there, where the hateful\r\nthing will be out of sight.”\r\n\r\n“We can do no more here and we might as well be starting,” added the old\r\nman. Between them they led me to the boat, the old man saying various\r\nthings about not putting your trust in things of this earth; that riches\r\nare not enduring; and other like remarks, all of which fell on my ear\r\nwithout at all penetrating to my understanding. To tell the truth, I\r\nwas utterly dazed and unable to give the thing any sort of consecutive\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nWe made the run quickly to Home Creek, and all went early to bed, a most\r\ndisheartened lot of mortals. Contrary to my expectation, I soon fell\r\nasleep and slept soundly all night long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE WAVES IN HARNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a carefully concocted plan carried out industriously and faithfully\r\nresults in a total failure to achieve the end sought, the consequences\r\nare disastrous in more ways than one. There is first the loss of all the\r\nlabor, which is important; and secondly, and far more important, there\r\nis also inevitably a loss of confidence in one’s own power to achieve\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nI went to my hammock under the shed that night humiliated to the last\r\ndegree, with a sense of utter contempt for my own judgment,--in short,\r\nin a sneering mood, criticising the folly I had displayed in not\r\nforeseeing events and making due provision for them. In a rank spirit of\r\nself-criticism and self-condemnation I reviewed what I had done, and\r\nwhat I had left undone, and deliberately pronounced myself a stupid ass\r\nfor all my pains. Nevertheless, as before stated I went very quickly to\r\nsleep, and slept the traditional sleep of the just until after dawn.\r\n\r\nWhen I awakened, the new risen sun hung bathed in fleecy clouds of\r\nprimrose just above a sea all golden and flashing with his level beams;\r\nthe dew gemmed each blade and leaf; the cool morning air trembled gently\r\namong the glistening foliage; the birds sang in noisy chorus far and\r\nnear; everything was fresh and rested and hopeful and fair and\r\nencouraging.\r\n\r\nI felt braced and full of confidence and hope; all the worry and trouble\r\nof the night had rolled away and gone. Never say die! There is no such\r\nthing as fail. The only question now is, what shall we do next? How\r\nshall we protect the wreck where it lies, and overcome the obstacles\r\nthat have risen in our path? I went whistling a jolly tune down to the\r\nbathing-place in the creek, took a cool plunge in the clear water, and\r\nreturned light-hearted, confident, and happy, to rouse my companions,\r\nthat they also might feel the inspiring effect of the beautiful morning.\r\nI wanted somebody to talk with, to discuss the hundred half-formed\r\nprojects with which my brain already teemed. I wanted to get to work\r\nagain on some new line, and felt that no moment should be lost. I went\r\nto the door and called them; then built a fire and put the kettle on for\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\nWhen Alice Millward came down to the fire, radiant in the beauty of\r\nhealth and freshness, her cheek flushed, her beautiful eyes sparkling,\r\nand a rebellious tendril of silken hair trembling over her brow in the\r\nbreath of the morning, I so looked my admiration that she instinctively\r\nblushed. I turned away, busying myself with the fire. Somehow I could\r\nnot help whistling snatches of the merry air that had been running in my\r\nhead all the morning.\r\n\r\nShe caught my eye presently and said in a tone of full conviction, “Mr.\r\nMorgan, you have found some way of getting that treasure. I know you\r\nhave by your manner this morning.”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken, Miss Millward. I only wish you were not. The fact is\r\nI have only just found that it is possible to begin again calmly to\r\nthink and plan. But that discovery is quite enough to cheer one. It is a\r\ngood deal to have recovered from the stunning disappointment of\r\nyesterday, and to have regained composure and confidence; for that is\r\nequivalent to regaining one’s faculties. Don’t you think so?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I suppose so,” she answered, with a little air of thoughtfulness,\r\n“but I really do not know; for to speak the truth I do not think I felt\r\nthe disappointment so severely as either you or father. Of course I was\r\nsorry, but then you see I was not so deeply interested, perhaps, as you\r\ntwo were.”\r\n\r\nMr. Millward now came up, and after the usual morning greeting said, “I\r\nimagine it will now be in order to begin to think of getting back to\r\ncivilization. Our labors here seem to have come to naught.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said I with some heat, “I shall not leave until I find it utterly\r\nimpossible to explore that sunken hull. I could not rest comfortably\r\nelsewhere so long as a bit of hope was left. Of course,” I added, after\r\na moment’s pause, “I cannot ask you to remain. But I do hope you will\r\nconsent to stay a few days longer. We ought to protect the wreck from\r\ndestruction in some way before the next gale. And I think it can be\r\ndone.”\r\n\r\n“But how?” said he.\r\n\r\n“Ah, that is the question, that is the problem,” I replied. “If we could\r\nbuild a breakwater across the mouth of the chasm in some manner the hull\r\nwould lie safely where it is. We could then leave, and come back with\r\ndivers to get the treasure at a later time.”\r\n\r\n“To stand the shock of the waves which will dash through that place in a\r\ngale of wind from the right quarter, your breakwater will require to be\r\na powerful structure. And the building of it would be an engineering\r\nfeat of no small magnitude, I take it.” And the old man shook his head\r\nslowly, as though to say he did not believe it possible.\r\n\r\nEven as he was talking, however, the half-formed plan which had been\r\nfloating hazily through my mind took definite shape. The chasm, the\r\nrocks, the swell and waves racing through were all so pictured in my\r\nmind that there was no need to go again and look at the place, because\r\nit was then before me in imagination as vividly as though I actually\r\nbeheld it. The remedy for the danger was clear and plain to my mind. I\r\nwent up to my two companions and taking a hand of each, said as\r\nearnestly as I felt: “We can do it. I see how it can be done. It is, I\r\nnow believe, a piece of rare good luck that the old galleon drifted into\r\nthat place. For consider; if she had struck upon the open beach she\r\nwould inevitably have gone to pieces in the breakers, and who knows\r\nwhether what of her cargo we want would have washed up to dry land. I\r\ntell you now, and believe me it is true, fortune has favored us.”\r\n\r\n“But the breakwater,” said the old man, impatiently, “how can we\r\nconstruct such a thing?”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said I, with a smile and an air of mystery, “you shall\r\nknow; but as the coffee boils, let us have breakfast, and we will\r\ndiscuss it over our coffee.”\r\n\r\n“I am quite agreed to that,” replied he, “but fear it will need to be\r\nhelped out by all the aid the good coffee can give it, my boy. However,\r\nI am open to conviction. You have done wonders in getting the wreck\r\nwhere she is, and I hope you may be right in your belief that the berth\r\nis a lucky one.”\r\n\r\nWhen we were fairly seated, the corn bread broken, and the steaming hot\r\ncoffee poured out by the hand of Alice, the old man nodded at me as much\r\nas to say, “Now fire away.”\r\n\r\nAlice voiced the same request in words, saying: “Now give us your great\r\nplan, Mr. Morgan. I am sure it will be a success. How will you construct\r\nthe breakwater?”\r\n\r\n“My dear Miss Alice, I expect to induce the sea to do that work for me\r\nin the most part. I shall harness the wild waves of ocean to my dirt\r\ncart, and make them labor to protect the old hull they would delight to\r\ndestroy.” And I calmly filled my mouth with corn bread, while Mr.\r\nMillward looked at me as though he feared I had become demented by the\r\nrecent disappointment. There was silence for a moment or two. Then,\r\nlooking furtively at me, he said:--\r\n\r\n“But I do not understand how you expect to harness your steeds, even if\r\nsuch unruly creatures were willing to work for us.”\r\n\r\n“Still, you will confess it is very simple,” I said, oracularly. “We\r\nhave only to offer these waves work they always delight in doing, and\r\nyou may be sure they will work day and night, high tide and low tide, to\r\nget it done, and when it is accomplished they will sigh and moan and\r\ncrash and roar for more. That is the ceaseless, persistent disposition\r\nthey have, and the harder the wind and the bigger the waves the quicker\r\nwill the work be done. My plan is simply this: to get the waves to work\r\nthrowing up sand to fill that chasm and bury the wreck if necessary in\r\nsand. If it is buried we can easily dig it out. But we need not wait for\r\nthe entire chasm to be filled. It will be enough if the mouth and exit\r\npassage are filled. Look out at yonder beach and see the unruly breakers\r\nat their daily task of throwing up tons and tons of sand, and as\r\nconstantly dragging it back again that they may have more of their\r\ndelightful occupation. You have only to throw down a rock, or a branch,\r\nor some obstacle to retain the sand and hold it from being dragged back,\r\nand it will presently be buried beneath the heap which it has retained.”\r\n\r\n“I see what you mean,” said Mr. Millward, setting down his cup of\r\ncoffee, which he had held in his hand, “but I do not yet understand how\r\nyou propose to prevent the constant scour that is going on in that\r\nrace-way. You must first stop that scouring action, and then I agree\r\nthat the place in time will fill with sand.”\r\n\r\nThen I proceeded in detail to explain how by cutting down trees and\r\nthrowing them into the mouth of the chasm I hoped first to get the tops\r\nburied in the sand, and then by adding brush and branches to create\r\nfinally a bar of sand at this point, which could be constantly added to\r\nby more tree tops and branches and the sand cast up, until it was as\r\nhigh as the waves could reach. Near by grew mangrove trees in a little\r\nlagoon. These would answer our purpose as well as any; they could be\r\nfelled into the water and floated to place.\r\n\r\nAll excitement and full of hope, now that a feasible plan had presented\r\nitself, we discussed the matter in all its bearings, until Mr. Millward,\r\nrising, declared we must waste no more time, but go to work while the\r\nweather held good. There was, indeed, no time to lose, as a northeast\r\ngale meant destruction to the old hulk, if it should occur before the\r\nguard could be built.\r\n\r\nAt once we loaded into the boat blankets and a sail for shelter, and\r\nprovisions for several days, including five great calabashes of water,\r\nintending to camp at the point so as to be near our work while the\r\npresent danger should continue. By nine o’clock we were out of the creek\r\nand under way, and soon reached the place where we intended to land. We\r\nmoored the boat in safety under shelter of the rocks to the west of the\r\npoint, where she would be safe except in case of a severe storm; then we\r\nput up the sail that we had brought for a tent, and landed such things\r\nas were wanted there, putting Alice as usual in control as housekeeper.\r\n\r\nThe long spar which we had used to connect the two triangles of our\r\nlifting-frame, we found beached to the west of the rocks, and torn loose\r\nfrom the triangles, which had washed away and disappeared. It was Mr.\r\nMillward’s suggestion that we could utilize this piece of timber to good\r\nadvantage by cutting it to the right length, and wedging it across the\r\nmouth of the chasm at about the height of low water, for the butts of\r\nthe trees forming the abattis to rest upon. To get this spar into the\r\nwater and tow it around to the mouth of the chasm was the first job we\r\nundertook. For this purpose we used my boat, the “Mohawk,” as being the\r\nlightest to row. By dinner time (about one o’clock) we had the spar\r\nsawed off and dropped down between the rocks, where it wedged itself, as\r\nthe wall was slanting at each side. To secure it more firmly in place we\r\nresorted to the expedient of tying a great stone on the end of a line\r\nand dropping it down on the spar several times at each end, standing for\r\nthis purpose on the rocks above. We kept up this pile-driving operation\r\nuntil the spar began to splinter slightly. It now lay across the mouth\r\nof the chasm at about a foot above low water, so firmly wedged in place\r\nthat no wave could displace it, unless it should be powerful enough to\r\nbreak the great, tough beam in twain, which was not very likely.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we took my boat into the small lagoon on the west coast\r\nnear the north point, and began the other branch of our work by cutting\r\ndown a couple of trees which stood near deep water, and grew in the\r\nwater itself on branching roots uprising in a complicated maze. These\r\ntrees, one at a time and by dint of hard work, we towed out into the sea\r\nand brought round to the mouth of the chasm. Here we manœuvred until we\r\ngot the butt end pointed at the spar, and then let go at the right\r\nmoment so that the swell as it entered the chasm swept the tree bodily\r\ninto the exact place we wanted it to go, the butt lying on the wedged-in\r\nspar, and the top presented to the waves. To weight the top down and\r\nmake it sink we threw into the branches several heavy rocks. When in\r\nplace the tree lay at an angle of about forty-five degrees with the\r\nhorizon, the butt resting on the spar, and the branches on the bottom.\r\n\r\nI had some fear that the shock of the tree striking against the spar\r\nmight dislodge the latter; but it had no effect of that kind, the spar\r\nbeing much too tightly wedged. Moreover the chasm, as I have already\r\nstated, narrowed gradually from the mouth inward as well as from the top\r\ndownward. So the blows of the waves only served still further to tighten\r\nthe spar in place. We managed to get the two trees in place and weighted\r\nwith rocks before we were called to supper at sunset. We had made a fair\r\nstart, and accomplished a good day’s work. The supper, spread on the\r\nground and eaten by firelight, was a merry meal, though we were very\r\ntired and glad to get to sleep. We needed a strong rope that had been\r\nleft at Home Creek, and I concluded to walk there along the beach after\r\nsupper, and sleeping at home to return at early dawn with the rope\r\nbefore breakfast. So I bade my companions good-night and started down\r\nthe beach. The way was easy, and I reached the house in little over an\r\nhour and turned in immediately to secure a much needed rest.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned with the rope in the morning, as I came near the tent\r\nand while it was still hidden from view by the intervening foliage, I\r\nheard the voices of father and daughter joined in a hymn,--the clear,\r\nrich soprano of the girl, flute-like and full, mingling in harmony with\r\nthe noble baritone of the old man, whose voice was still unbroken by\r\nage. I paused a moment to listen to the wonderful song of praise, in\r\nwhich were mingled the deep booming bass of the surf, the myriad voices\r\nof the birds trilling an accompaniment, and the interwoven notes of the\r\nhymn, rising and falling together in sweet accord,--and my own heart was\r\nlifted up to the great Creator to whom such praise, I thought, might\r\nprove quite as acceptable as though sung by a full-voiced choir beneath\r\ncathedral arches to the accompaniment of the majestic chords of an\r\norgan.\r\n\r\nWhen the strains of the hymn had ceased I came up, and the hearty\r\ngreeting which I received was very pleasant. Indeed, the friendly sense\r\nof comradeship had become very strong among us all; and I have no doubt\r\nthey were as glad to see me after this short absence as I truly was to\r\nsee them.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast Mr. Millward and I began again at an early hour the work\r\nof filling, towing, placing, and weighting the trees. This day we placed\r\nfive in position. The next day we brought and placed five more, by which\r\ntime the entire mouth of the chasm was so full of the trunks, branches,\r\nand twigs that we could get no more in place. The fourth day of our\r\nlabors we spent in casting loose rocks in among the branches. The fifth\r\nday we passed in watching this _chevaux de frise_ and noting the effect\r\nof the waves, as they came frothing through the mass of twigs and\r\nbranches. The structure--if such it may be called--held firmly and broke\r\nthe swell completely.\r\n\r\nWe could do no more. The remainder of the work must be accomplished by\r\nthe waves themselves in their own time and way. For this we must wait\r\ntheir pleasure. There was still quite a strong current through the\r\nchasm, and I wished very much that this could be lessened, as its\r\ntendency was of course to carry through a large portion of the sand\r\nwhich might otherwise be retained. When I spoke of this to Mr. Millward\r\nhe immediately proposed that we should partly fill the narrow exit\r\npassage with rocks and limbs to check this current, and on the sixth day\r\nwe began this job. Instead of floating whole trees, which we could not\r\nhave managed to get into place without the aid of an ingoing swell, we\r\ncut and carried limbs and branches, which, together with rocks, were\r\nthrown down from above, until the end of the exit passage was a frothing\r\nmass of water struggling through the tangle. This very much lessened the\r\ncurrent, and we were well satisfied with the work. That evening we\r\nsailed the two boats back to Home Creek and moored them in their former\r\nhaven. The next day, which was the Sabbath, we spent in rest at home,\r\nleaving the waves now to do their work, and confident that no harm could\r\ncome to the hulk if the fair weather would continue for a few days\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, while we were seated beneath the shed, Mr. Millward read\r\nselections from the Psalms, in his deep, sonorous voice and impressive\r\nmanner. We joined afterward in prayer and hymn, and when this simple\r\nservice was over I started with Alice for a walk on the beach to the\r\nsouth, while Mr. Millward composed himself for a comfortable smoke in\r\nthe shade. The walking on the sand just above the reach of the waves,\r\nand yet where it was wet by an occasional toppling roller that came\r\nspuming up the slope farther than its fellows, was excellent, for the\r\nwetted sand was hard and firm and cool to the feet. Everywhere lay\r\nfragments of sea-weed, shells, and the curious forms of sea life cast up\r\nby the waves. We amused ourselves by collecting specimens of the\r\nmany-tinted weeds, mosses, and fragile structures, whether vegetable or\r\nanimal I know not, nor could any save a naturalist draw the dividing\r\nline. Alice explained how these delicate forms could be spread out and\r\ndried, by first floating them in water until they were untangled, and\r\nthen lifting them out by a plate of glass and drying them on paper.\r\n\r\n“I look forward now,” said she, “to the time when we shall be sailing\r\naway from our island home, and I would like to carry with me something\r\nby which to remember this beautiful beach.”\r\n\r\n“Are you getting tired of the life, Miss Millward?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, no,” she quickly answered, “not tired of it; far from that. It\r\nseems now quite like a home to me. You must remember that it is many\r\nyears since father and I have remained so long in one place as we have\r\nbeen here. I have grown quite to love this beautiful island. And the\r\nwork and the life is a real pleasure to me. But yet I fear that father\r\nis pining to be back to his work, or to civilization, though he has not\r\nyet said so in my hearing. It is hard, you know, for an old man to\r\nchange his habits.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you would find it pleasanter if you had some one of your own\r\nsex as a companion,” said I.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps so,” thoughtfully, “but I have never had any girl friends, you\r\nknow, in all my life; for we have been here in this region, among the\r\nislands, since I was quite a child, and have gone about from place to\r\nplace so much that I have had no chance to meet such friends as I might\r\nfeel like making my companions. The people are mostly of quite another\r\nreligion from ours,--those who are white I mean,--and though I have many\r\nfriends among the colored people, the Hindoos and others, the friendship\r\nhas not made me any comrades. Father has often said that he feared it\r\nwas his duty to send me north among people of my own kind, that I might\r\nlearn better what life in this world really means. But I think I do\r\nknow, for it must be much the same everywhere; and I should not like to\r\nleave father here alone.”\r\n\r\nThe thought of the wandering life which this motherless girl had led,\r\namong poor, half-heathen people, touched me, and I had it on my tongue\r\nto contrast such an existence with the very different sort of\r\nsurroundings she might have had elsewhere. But why should I do this?\r\nEven if she could understand it, which was doubtful, no good could come\r\nof creating in her mind longing and discontent; though I honestly\r\nbelieve discontent never could have found entrance to such a candid and\r\nhappy mind, no matter what might be held up for her imagination to\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\nThe sun soon beat down with fiery rays, and I cut for her a leaf of fan\r\npalm to form a sort of parasol. The picture she made in her light dress,\r\nagainst the blue sea all filled with glowing brightness, the shade of\r\nthe graceful leaf falling upon her, will live long in my memory. It\r\nseemed to me that her pure soul shone out from the beautiful eyes that\r\nnow and again met mine. Rare combination of something that seemed\r\nstraight from heaven with what was sweetly human and of our earth; the\r\nclear, pure spirit, and the beautiful woman glowing with health and\r\nfilled with life and color and made for human love--was there ever\r\nbefore, whispered my tortured heart, such an incomparable being? Dare I\r\nspeak to her of what fills my mind and soul? No; most certainly not.\r\n\r\nNow in point of fact I was making love to this girl with all my might,\r\nand did not know it. I wooed her all unconsciously, and had not dared to\r\nwoo her at all. The divine passion, I have since been told, needs no\r\nword or sign; and this girl, divinely pure and yet sweetly human,\r\ninexperienced as she was, must have felt that I adored her. If she had\r\nnever heard of the love of man for woman--and most likely she had never\r\ngiven it a thought--still she must have known my devotion to her quite\r\nas well as though the burning words that ever kept throbbing up from my\r\nheart for utterance had passed my lips. But I could not know. And so I\r\nalternated between the medium plane of faint hope and the cold depths\r\nof despair. I conclude, as I now look back, that I was not doing so\r\nbadly as I then thought.\r\n\r\nWe sat down on a rock together to watch the little hermit crabs, each\r\nwith a stolen shell that it had converted into a house, now peering out,\r\nnow drawing itself in, now dragging its house along the sand in search\r\nof food or a better location,--funny little creatures, that seem to link\r\nthe spider family to the crabs. Her hand was on my arm; we sat close\r\ntogether; the curved, flat edges of the spent waves nearly reached our\r\nfeet as they stole up the sand; the solemn sound of the sea was in our\r\nears, and the enchanting song of a first love filled my heart.\r\n\r\nAnd then we wandered slowly on along the beach, now and then compelled\r\nby a higher flow to step aside; we examined the lovely shells that lay\r\nin numbers and great variety bleaching on the margin of the dry sand, or\r\nwetted by the rising water; the little skipping sand borers; now and\r\nagain a gaping clam or hideous sea slug; dry shells of the great\r\nhorse-shoe crabs; bladder-weed and ocean tangle; and all the wonderful\r\ndébris that the sea casts up. Then turning in toward the land we came\r\namong the tall, graceful stems of the cocoa-palm, their feathery heads\r\ntrembling and rustling in the gently stirring air. Here we found in a\r\nlow shrub the little nest of one of those diminutive wagtail wrens, and\r\nwhile the anxious mother fluttered near, feigning a wound or inability\r\nto fly in order to draw us away from her precious little ones, we looked\r\nat the four tiny, gaping-mouthed children clad in down and naked\r\nhelplessness, until the distress of the comical little matron induced us\r\nto move away from the nest in pity.\r\n\r\nWe found too the purple passion-flower and gaudy cactus blossoms\r\nbursting out in showy splendor from thorn-armed, fleshy leaves,\r\nbright-feathered parrots and parroquets, a little humming-bird that bore\r\na flashing jewel in his breast and made a misty halo round about him\r\nwith his rapid wing, beating the air so fast that it seemed to the eye a\r\nfaint sphere of cloud.\r\n\r\nAnd so we wandered on side by side, talking of what we saw. I parted the\r\nthorny bushes for her path, lifted her over the rocks and logs, and hand\r\nin hand we crossed the grassy open where I had gathered seeds, now ripe\r\nagain, and thus came finally home, as the sun stood in the zenith.\r\n\r\nWe found the old man sleeping peacefully in my hammock under the shed,\r\nwith Bible in hand lying open on his breast. Duke lay on the ground\r\nbelow him, furtively opening an eye now and then, though without\r\nstirring when we came up. On the fire, now burned nearly out, slowly\r\nsteamed and simmered the dinner stew, whose appetizing odors floating to\r\nus apprised us of the fact that we were very hungry, just as the cool\r\nshade told us we were very warm, and the inviting armchairs suggested\r\nthat we were really tired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nEMBAYED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I arose shortly after dawn the next morning, it was with no small\r\ndegree of satisfaction that I found the sun brightly shining, and every\r\nindication present of a continuance of the fair weather and gentle\r\nbreezes which had now held continuously for ten days. Very anxious to\r\nknow the condition of the breakwater, Mr. Millward and I, shortly after\r\na hearty breakfast of fish freshly caught, started for a walk up the\r\nbeach to the resting-place of the galleon. We found no apparent change\r\nin the condition of the larger breakwater,--the one across the mouth of\r\nthe chasm,--but strangely enough the smaller one, across the exit\r\npassage, had so far silted up with sand as to form an almost complete\r\nobstruction to the flow of a current through the chasm at low water.\r\nIndeed, the sand had almost buried the branches we had cast in, and was\r\nrisen so far as to be plainly visible just below the surface of the\r\nwater. This was an altogether unexpected result, and it now looked very\r\nmuch as though the silting and filling was to take place from the exit\r\nbackward to the mouth, instead of from the mouth as we had calculated.\r\nHowever, it mattered not to us how the capricious waves chose to do\r\ntheir work, if only it were done.\r\n\r\nWe had brought the axe along, and without delay we began to cut and pile\r\ninto the exit passage more limbs and branches and rocks, until the place\r\nwas full to a level somewhat above high-tide mark. To facilitate\r\nfurther the formation of this bank, we cast many branches into the\r\nwaters of the chasm just back of the newly formed sand-bar, that it\r\nmight be caused if possible to rise high enough to prevent any through\r\ncurrent and consequent scouring action even at high tide.\r\n\r\nWe tried hard to ascertain whether the sand had begun to accumulate at\r\nthe breakwater across the mouth; but were unable to do so because of the\r\nlack of transparency of the water, which held in suspension a large\r\npercentage of sand and foreign matter stirred up by the swell. We both\r\nexpressed our confidence that as soon as the current through the chasm\r\nwas stopped, the sand would begin to silt in and fill up the main\r\nbreakwater.\r\n\r\nIt was two hours after noon when we returned to the house again. After\r\ndinner we all three turned to the work of digging sweet potatoes in my\r\nold garden, and storing them under the shed. All the crops were doing\r\nfinely and we found some green Indian corn just ripe enough to boil. In\r\nthe cool of the evening we sat under the shed to watch for the new moon\r\nto rise, discussing the theory and probable action of sand deposit by\r\nwaves.\r\n\r\nMr. Millward’s theory--and I believe it to be the correct one--was that\r\nthe sand was held in suspension only while the water was in very\r\nconsiderable motion; and that it fell to the bottom almost instantly\r\nwhen the motion of the water ceased. He likened it to stirring sugar,\r\nnot yet dissolved, in a glass of water. As soon as the stirring stopped\r\nthe sugar fell to the bottom. “Thus, for example,” he explained, “when a\r\nwave comes up on the beach in front of us, it is more or less charged\r\nwith sand; the sand is deposited just when the wave has spent its force\r\nand paused before the return flow. But, of course, the sand so deposited\r\non the naked beach would be picked up again and carried back, to be\r\nagain brought up, and so on in ceaseless round.” And the reason, he\r\ninsisted, why the sand gathered at the last breakwater in the chasm\r\ninstead of at the first one, was simply because at that place the\r\ncurrent and consequent motion were least.\r\n\r\nEach morning I walked up the beach to the chasm, sometimes alone and\r\nsometimes accompanied by Mr. Millward. In two days the breakwater at the\r\nexit was completely covered with sand, which rose above the level of\r\nhigh tide, and the sand had already begun to silt into the chasm back of\r\nthe exit. On the third day we found a great shark embayed in the chasm\r\nand dashing around the old hull every little while, as though in a\r\nflurry of excitement. Each time a wave would break in he would endeavor\r\nto swim out, following the retreating water,--for now there was no\r\nlonger a current through,--but the trees and limbs prevented him. Mr.\r\nMillward said he seemed like an evil spirit set to guard the galleon and\r\nits treasure; and indeed it would have been a dangerous thing for any\r\none to attempt exploration of the wreck while this man-eating sentinel\r\npatrolled the narrow water where she lay.\r\n\r\nThe sight of this voracious fish reminded me very forcibly of the great\r\ndanger which would have attended any attempt to reach the hull by diving\r\nwhen the galleon lay out in the sea. Had I brought my diving-apparatus\r\nsafely to the island, as I originally intended to do, it is quite\r\npossible, and even probable, that I should have found a grave among the\r\ngastric fluids of some such shark. Strangely enough, in all the many\r\ntimes I had looked at the wreck through the water-glass while it lay out\r\nin the sea, I had never seen a single shark, though other fish had been\r\nvisible in considerable numbers and variety. But doubtless, as is the\r\ntreacherous nature of this tiger of the sea, he was lying there\r\nconcealed and instinctively watching the boat in expectation of prey. It\r\nmade me shudder involuntarily to think of the possible encounter that I\r\nmight have had. As the shark imprisoned in the chasm was no present\r\ninconvenience to us, we allowed him to remain undisturbed where he was.\r\n\r\nAs we stood on the rock which adjoined the shore, watching the frothing\r\nof the surges through the breakwater at the mouth of the chasm, I\r\npointed out to Mr. Millward that every few minutes, at intervals of\r\nabout every third wave, the water rushing back met the incoming wave\r\nexactly at the breakwater and the resulting interference produced there\r\na temporary quiet in the waters.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said I, in reference to this fact, “if your theory is right we\r\nought to be getting a discharge of sand at the breakwater every time\r\nthere is such a meeting of the waters there.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said he, “there is no doubt of it; and we shall soon be\r\nhaving a bar at this point. Whether this bar will rise high enough to\r\nstop the water materially from coming in before the whole chasm has\r\nsilted full of sand is something we cannot determine except by waiting\r\nto find out by actual test.”\r\n\r\n“Nor does it greatly matter,” I added, “for in either event the galleon\r\nwould be safely housed.”\r\n\r\nThe weather held fair for a week longer, and at the end of that time it\r\nhad become quite evident that a bank of sand was steadily forming at the\r\nmouth of the chasm. It was already nearly up to the surface at low\r\nwater, so that the inrush of water was very small compared with what it\r\nhad been. We had gone up to the chasm in the morning as usual, and then\r\nagain in the evening of the same day, as the weather was very\r\nthreatening and the heat intense, and a glassy calm was on the sea,\r\nwhich, almost devoid even of a swell, spread out in a flat,\r\nmetallic-looking plain with scarcely a wrinkle. A storm was surely\r\nbrewing, and we might expect it that night or the following day at\r\nlatest. But as there was nothing to do, except to wait its arrival and\r\nabide the result, I only went to the chasm to satisfy my curiosity. When\r\nI arrived, an hour or two before sunset, and examined the place\r\ncarefully, I thought the galleon would probably be safe, unless the\r\nsurge became so heavy as to sweep the breakwater out on its return flow.\r\nMr. Millward was of the same opinion.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight that night I was wakened by a tremendous crash of\r\nthunder. The sky was black with heavy clouds, lit up at short intervals\r\nby the lightning, and it had already begun to rain. Owing to the heat, I\r\nhad been sleeping in my hammock at the shed. I immediately got up,\r\npartly dressed myself, and carried my hammock to the house, where I\r\nfound my companions both wakened by the thunder. I called Duke in and\r\nsecured the door, expecting a heavy rain, which speedily came down with\r\na rush and steady roar upon the thatched roof. The wind followed from\r\nthe old quarter, the northeast, and soon became almost a gale, beating\r\nand driving the rain against the walls in angry gusts.\r\n\r\nMr. Millward and I, talking through the darkness, speculated on the\r\nprobable result to the galleon; but being unable, of course, to reach\r\nany satisfactory conclusion, we dropped finally to sleep, thus\r\nforgetting our worry and anxiety.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, after a cold breakfast, without coffee,--for the fire\r\nwas out, everything in the way of fuel was wet, and there was no sun\r\nvisible,--I started for the chasm. Breasting the stiff gale, which was\r\naccompanied by spits and dashes of rain, I made my way along the beach,\r\nfull of apprehension as I saw the huge rollers come crashing in, and the\r\nheavy swell that had been raised by the gale. When I came to the north\r\ncape, and the rocks forming the chasm were in sight, the scene was\r\nindeed one of grandeur, and my worst fears seemed to have good grounds.\r\nThe tremendous swell running in against the rocks broke with a\r\nthunderous noise; the spray flew high in the air, and was blown\r\napparently clear over the rocks.\r\n\r\nI had hurried along thus far as rapidly as I could travel against the\r\nstrong wind; but now I hesitated, dreading to go far enough to see what\r\nhad happened to the galleon. However, no good could come of waiting, so\r\nI plunged ahead and soon came to the rock which joined the shore, and\r\nascended it that I might have a fair view of the chasm. I found that the\r\nchasm no longer existed as we had known it. Instead of an open race-way\r\nthrough which the current rushed, or into which the rollers broke, there\r\nwas now a peaceful little pool, in the midst of which the galleon was\r\ndimly visible, sunk some feet below the surface. The water in this pool\r\nwas not very clear; for every few minutes a mighty shower of spray flung\r\non high fell like rain upon its surface, and the rocks all about were\r\ndrenched, and covered with little rivulets. Even the spot where I stood\r\nwas not exempt, but I took the wetting with cheerful fortitude under the\r\ncircumstances. Both breakwaters were completely covered with sand. The\r\none at the mouth was almost like a sand-hill, and reached nearly to the\r\nstem of the galleon, but was so drenched by the falling spray that I did\r\nnot care to go upon it. The one at the rear, or exit, was far enough\r\naway so that the spray did not fall upon it to any great extent, and I\r\ntherefore climbed down upon it to see how firm it was. I was very\r\ncertain no one seeing this bank of sand would have imagined how it had\r\nbeen made. There was no indication whatever that the hand of man had had\r\nanything to do with its construction. It looked quite as though the sand\r\nhad lain there for ages. The waves had done their work most thoroughly,\r\nand the aged hulk now rested in a quiet, land-locked harbor, as safe and\r\nsecure from the sea as though it were in a dry dock.\r\n\r\nWet through by rain and spray combined, but elated and in the highest of\r\nspirits at the condition of our work, I hastened back as fast as my feet\r\nwould carry me, helped on by the wind now at my back, to convey the\r\njoyful intelligence to my companions. Duke, who had accompanied me,\r\nseemed to read my satisfaction in my face and actions, for he bounded\r\nalong frisking and barking as though the whole thing were a grand\r\nfrolic. When I came to the creek he had already run on ahead to the\r\nhouse, so that Mr. Millward and Alice were apprised of my return, and\r\nwere at the door looking for me as I came up to the house.\r\n\r\n“What news do you bring?” asked the old man, anxiously.\r\n\r\n“The best of good news,” cried I, “the very best of good news! The\r\ngalleon is safely and snugly at rest in a basin where a tornado could\r\nnot reach it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that is good!” said the old man, fervently.\r\n\r\n“Excellent!” echoed the daughter, and added, solicitously, “but you are\r\nvery wet, Mr. Morgan, and you must change your garments at once. It will\r\nnever do to have the courier who brings such good tidings take harm by\r\nhis journey.”\r\n\r\nAfter I had gone into my little sleeping-place and put on dry clothing,\r\nwe sat down, and I had to describe minutely what I had seen. We then\r\nwent into general committee to discuss ways and means for getting at the\r\ncargo of the sunken hull. Mr. Millward was for setting sail at the first\r\nfavorable wind for Martinique to get divers and return with them. But I\r\ncould not bring myself to agree to leaving the galleon to chance for so\r\nlong a time as that might require. We had already successfully overcome\r\nso many difficulties that those remaining seemed trifling in comparison;\r\nthough I am free to confess that just how we were to get at the contents\r\nof the hull was not at all clear to my mind at that time.\r\n\r\nWe had discussed the situation a long time, and as I had nothing to\r\noffer but mere resistance and unwillingness to leave, I felt that the\r\nold gentleman was gradually getting the better of the discussion, and\r\nhad fairly driven me to the last ditch, when Alice came to my assistance\r\nwith a suggestion that supplied a new stock of ammunition to my\r\nretreating forces.\r\n\r\nThe dear girl’s suggestion was in these words, “Why don’t you pump the\r\nwater out of the basin and leave the galleon dry?”\r\n\r\nWhy, indeed? What was to hinder? It would be difficult to make an\r\nair-pump, but not at all difficult to contrive some sort of\r\nwater-raising device.\r\n\r\n“Thanks, fair Alice, for the idea. It rehabilitates me,” thought I; and\r\nmeeting her eyes I added aloud, “You have hit upon the very idea, Miss\r\nAlice. We can get the water out of that basin with far less trouble than\r\na voyage to Martinique and return would cost.”\r\n\r\nThe old man was silent.\r\n\r\nTurning to him I said, “Your daughter deserves our warmest thanks, Mr.\r\nMillward, for this suggestion. Now we have only to contrive some\r\nwater-lifting device, and we can set to work on the final task. What do\r\nyou say?”\r\n\r\n“I say that if it is feasible I will stay of course.”\r\n\r\nWe discussed all the water-raising contrivances we had ever heard of,\r\nfrom the primitive Egyptian shadoof--a bucket on a balanced pole--to the\r\nrotary steam-pump. But steam-pumps were not to be had, and it was\r\naggravating to think about them. However, I went conscientiously through\r\nthe entire list, and was listened to most patiently. It chanced that\r\namong other devices there was one I had heard of as being used in India\r\nby the natives to raise water for irrigation. It consisted of a wheel to\r\nwhich were suspended a number of gourds. Mr. Millward at once remembered\r\nseeing these very machines in use, and told how he had witnessed the\r\nbreech-clouted coolies toiling with them on the banks of the rivers. He\r\nimmediately agreed that we could easily build such a machine, and that\r\nit would accomplish the work.\r\n\r\n“The amount of water raised in a day from the river with one of these\r\nrude machines and poured into the irrigating canal by the efforts of a\r\nsingle native workman is truly astonishing,” said he. After thinking a\r\nmoment he added, “But you overlook one thing, Mr. Morgan. These machines\r\nare only adapted to lifting water from a river or other source of supply\r\nwhich remains at or near a constant level. Now, here the water to be\r\nlifted will be getting constantly lower, and as it falls the wheel also\r\nmust be lowered and would soon be so low that it would no longer bring\r\nthe gourds high enough to discharge their contents above the breakwater.\r\nYou see that, do you not?”\r\n\r\nIn truth, I had not seen it at all. But when the difficulty was thus\r\nsuggested it was plain enough that such a wheel would never do for what\r\nwe wanted. I did not answer this most pertinent suggestion, for the\r\nvery good reason that it could not be controverted. The wheel idea was\r\nquite out of the question.\r\n\r\nAfter a little while he resumed by saying, “But I have also seen a\r\nmodification of the same sort of machine, in which the gourds were\r\nattached to an endless rope instead of to the wheel itself. This device\r\nis used by the same people where the water is to be raised to a greater\r\nheight than can conveniently be done with the wheel. I think we might\r\npossibly make such a modification work successfully.”\r\n\r\n“Can you recall how this modification was constructed?” said I,\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I can recall enough to enable you to get the idea,” he replied,\r\nthrowing back his head and closing his eyes in the effort to remember.\r\n“Yes,” said he, after a little reflection, “I think I can. I remember\r\nthe general features very well indeed. However, the most vivid\r\nrecollection I have, connected with these machines, is the hideous,\r\ncreaking screech of their ungreased axles as they were turned hour after\r\nhour all through the hot summer nights, the natives ‘spelling’ one\r\nanother at the work. How well I remember the dry, hot nights when I lay\r\nlistening to these sounds from far and near. You could easily tell when\r\nthe laboring coolie was tired by the gradual slowing of his machine and\r\nthe lengthening of the interval between screeches. Then a fresh man\r\nmounted the treadmill and the screeches quickened; and so these\r\nmonotonous alternations continued through the still night.”\r\n\r\nAfter a few reminiscences of his old life in India the old man proceeded\r\nto give a description of the machine as nearly as he could recall it. It\r\nconsisted of a drum, or skeleton wheel, about six feet in diameter,\r\nmounted on a platform over the water; each end of the drum overhung the\r\nplatform and carried an endless rope, to which open-mouthed gourds were\r\ntied at regular intervals. The drum was revolved by stepping on its bars\r\nas in a treadmill. The gourds were carried down into the water empty and\r\nbrought up full by the endless rope. Troughs at each side received the\r\nwater as the gourds tipped to return. In short, it was a sort of\r\nchain-pump, or modification of that well-known device. From his\r\ndescription, aided by my own imagination and a full knowledge of the\r\nresult sought, I was able to reconstruct in my mind this machine, or at\r\nleast to see how one could be built that I conceived would answer the\r\npurpose. We agreed that we would start at this work as soon as the\r\nweather was pleasant enough to be out of doors with reasonable comfort.\r\n\r\nIt was very tedious to be without any fire or means of obtaining one\r\nduring the rain. The house was getting damp; we missed our hot coffee;\r\ncold victuals were not pleasant, and our supply of cooked food was about\r\ngone, so that if the rain continued we should speedily be reduced to raw\r\nbacon and cocoanuts. As the leaden sky gave no immediate promise of\r\nsunshine, Mr. Millward and I concluded to try our hand at producing fire\r\nby friction. For this purpose we attached a piece of hard wood to the\r\nfinal shaft of the old fanning-mill, and setting it in rapid motion held\r\na piece of soft wood against it as it revolved. I turned the crank while\r\nhe held the wood. It presently began to char and smoke, but no fire\r\ncame, though I ground away until the sweat poured off my body. We were\r\nabout to give it up as a bad job, when Mr. Millward hit upon the idea of\r\nrasping off a quantity of fine wood-dust by grinding a piece of wood on\r\nthe end of the iron shaft itself. When he had collected some of this\r\nand sprinkled it into the hot, smoking cavity of the softwood stick the\r\nmotion soon caused the light material to catch fire, and we were\r\nspeedily rewarded with a glowing coal from which we were able to start\r\nthe fire, which you may be certain was not permitted to go out again. I\r\nvery quickly had a hot fire in the oven, one near the shed out of doors,\r\nand a third in the fireplace of the house. With fire, life became\r\nspeedily more endurable.\r\n\r\nThe comforting and cheering influence of an open fire, the sight of the\r\nblaze or the glowing coals, is a mysterious thing, and is not to be\r\nexplained by the mere personal comfort due to the warmth, for a close\r\nstove or a steam coil will give that as well and perhaps better and more\r\nequably. There is an instinctive something deep down in the heart of man\r\nthat responds to the open fire, and makes it act like a tonic on the\r\ndisposition. This feeling is common apparently to all mankind. Everybody\r\nalike, old or young, rich or poor, is cheered by the glow and blaze of\r\nthe fireside, the crackle of the burning, the sight of the flames on the\r\nhearth. Men who have been brought up from childhood to live in houses\r\nheated by the modern steam, hot-water, or hot-air apparatus, or have\r\nlived in the tropics where fires for warmth are rarely if ever needed,\r\nno sooner approach the blazing hearth than they feel its cheering\r\ninfluence. I have thought sometimes that the explanation might be found\r\nin heredity,--in a deep-seated habit of the human mind descending from\r\nparent to child through countless ages and generations. Far back of\r\nhistory, in the dim twilight of primitive life, we may imagine our\r\nancestors living in such wildness as can scarcely be found on earth\r\nto-day even among the lowest savages; and we can picture the primitive\r\nhunter returning exhausted from the chase to seek his rest and comfort\r\nby the open fireside. By the fireside he rests, by the fireside he\r\neats, here he meets his family, here in his nakedness he is warm, here\r\nare all his joys and loves and comforts. Every pleasure and every\r\ncomfort are directly associated with the sight of the glowing embers and\r\nthe bright, leaping blaze. And this has been going on through thousands\r\nand thousands of years. When Nature so impresses their habits upon her\r\ncreatures that the dog, ages after it has become domesticated, will yet\r\nrun round and round before lying down on a carpet, because its wild\r\nancestors did so in order to flatten the tall grass in which they slept,\r\nis it too much to believe that man should have kept the habit of\r\nassociating comfort with the sight of an open fireside?\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the true explanation, the fact was that the glowing fire\r\nin the chimney cheered our hearts, and made us merry, as we sat laughing\r\nand talking and joking, and listening to the old man’s tales that night;\r\nand this pure delight was not in any wise lessened by the moaning of the\r\nwind and the intermittent dash of the rain upon the walls and roof. We\r\nthree and Duke, in a sociable semi-circle lighted only by the flickering\r\nrays of the fire, enjoyed the shelter, the homelike sense of comfort,\r\nand the quiet of perfect content that night, and it seemed to all, I\r\ndoubt not, as it did to me, a pity that the hour of bedtime should come\r\naround to break up so pleasant a party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE PEARL-FISHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor two days longer the rain continued, and then with a gentle southerly\r\nbreeze the sky cleared and the sun came out again, lighting up once more\r\nthe land and sea and releasing us from the confinement indoors, which\r\nhad begun to grow irksome. Of course the first thing to be done was for\r\nall three of us to be ferried over the creek and to walk up the beach to\r\nthe galleon. The two sand-banks were now dry and the water in the basin\r\nwas quite clear and transparent, so that the hull was plainly visible,\r\nthe raised poop and forecastle being only about three or four feet under\r\nthe surface. All her masts and spars had fallen and disappeared long\r\nago. A cluster of corals seemed to indicate where the foremast once had\r\nstood. A curious thing was the appearance of a single pane of glass\r\nwhich was visible in the side of the cabin. This pane had changed its\r\ntransparent quality to a milky condition of pearly irridescence, and\r\nshone under water like a gem as it caught and reflected the light from\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nThis vessel never could have been noted for speed, I thought, as the\r\nhull appeared to be a regular tub, with high bows and stern, a great\r\nbreadth of beam, and a low mid-deck or waist where lay the green remains\r\nof what had once been four brass carronades. When sailing close-hauled\r\nshe probably went to leeward faster than she drew ahead. Doubtless such\r\nwas the ancient fashion of ships, and it accounts for the fact that the\r\nold voyagers were sometime wind-bound, until the green moss and weeds\r\ngrew plentiful on their hulls, and the water and provisions gave out,\r\nand the dreadful scurvy came to sweep away half the crew. I could\r\npicture this lumping old craft as she might have looked when the old\r\nadmiral commanded her beneath the broad flag of Spain,--her crowded\r\ndecks, her tall masts, the gorgeous array of bright-colored garments\r\nworn by the dusky grandees who were on board, the images of the saints,\r\nthe crucifix at the wheel, the shaven priest, and all the pomp and\r\nceremony that attended her clumsy progress to strange ports.\r\n\r\nI knew the history of her last voyage well. I knew how she had twice\r\nrounded Cape Horn and stanchly buffeted the storms of two oceans; of the\r\ntroops she had landed, the treasure she had taken up, and the final\r\nscene when with sails set and colors flying she sank beneath the waves.\r\nLong ago every soul who then lived had gone to the other world; the\r\nadmiral, his officers and his crew, the king and queen and all their\r\ncourt were now returned to dust. Yet here lay the fabric of teak and\r\noak, still strong and stanch and enduring, and the store of gold that I\r\nhoped to get. Were the shades of these departed ones aware that a\r\nheretic was planning and contriving to get the long sunken treasure, so\r\nmuch of which had been once designed for the coffers of the holy mother\r\nChurch?\r\n\r\nWe made a careful survey of the basin, and selected the lesser bank of\r\nsand, that forming the breakwater at the narrow end of the chasm, as a\r\nsuitable site for the pumping-apparatus. Mr. Millward pointed out to me\r\nthe fact that the water stood higher in the basin than the then level of\r\nthe sea,--a proof, he insisted, that the water did not percolate to any\r\nconsiderable extent through the firmly packed sand. This was a highly\r\nimportant fact to us. Had it been otherwise we never could have hoped to\r\npump the basin dry, or below the sea level.\r\n\r\nWith a line we took some measurements which we expected to need, and\r\nthen set out on our return to the house.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of convenience we decided to build the water-raising machine\r\ncomplete and set it up and test it at the creek near the house, where we\r\ncould be near such domestic comforts as we possessed; after which we\r\ncould load it on the boat and convey it to the chasm. And this work we\r\nset about at once. As I have already indicated what this machine was to\r\nbe I need not here again detail minutely its construction. The wheel we\r\nmade chiefly of stout bamboo, the water-troughs of hollowed logs; the\r\nbearings, in deference to Mr. Millward’s recollection of the uncouth\r\nscreeching of the machine’s Indian predecessors, we supplied liberally\r\nwith grease. In ten days the thing was complete and set up at the creek\r\nfor trial,--troughs, platform, and all. I had arranged that the water\r\nmight flow from the troughs into a ditch leading to our garden to\r\nirrigate the growing crops.\r\n\r\nWhen all was ready I mounted the wheel, and like a horse in a treadmill\r\n(perhaps a better simile would be like a hod-carrier climbing an endless\r\nladder) began to turn it. Up came the full gourds, splashing the water\r\nat quick intervals alternately into the two troughs, whence it flowed\r\ndown to the ditch in tinkling rills, steadily and continuously, as long\r\nas I chose to keep up the ladder-climbing action. It was going to prove\r\nrather hard work, I fancied; but nevertheless it was a perfect success,\r\nas I was continually lifting more than half my own weight in water with\r\nas little exertion as could have been required to accomplish that\r\nresult. Then Mr. Millward tried his footing on the machine; and finally\r\nwe had to help up Alice to try it in turn. Altogether it was unanimously\r\npronounced a grand success, and we only waited for a fair wind that we\r\nmight take it down and embark it for the chasm. Unfortunately for our\r\npatience, the wind veered around into the northeast again, and was quite\r\ntoo heavy to allow us to make the voyage with safety, as the rollers\r\ncame tumbling in over the bar at the mouth of the creek at such rate\r\nthat there would be great danger of swamping the boat in any endeavor we\r\nmight make to get outside.\r\n\r\nI was so impatient at this delay that I had half a mind to take the\r\nmachine apart and attempt to carry it piecemeal overland. But it was\r\nuseless to repine over the inevitable. It was not probable that I should\r\ngain an hour of time by undertaking to lug the machine overland, and I\r\nshould simply have a great labor for naught. There was therefore nothing\r\nto do but to possess our souls with patience and await the issue.\r\n\r\nAside from the wind, which blew half a gale, the weather was pleasant,\r\nand the sun shone warm and bright. As we had nothing better to do, it\r\nwas agreed that we should make an overland excursion to the old\r\nplantation for the purpose of getting some fresh fruit. One morning\r\nearly, after a good breakfast, we ferried over the creek and started\r\nwith light hearts and in holiday spirits up the beach, the wind blowing\r\nstiffly and the breakers crashing in beside us. I assisted Alice\r\nMillward with my arm, for the breeze was strong enough to make walking\r\nagainst it difficult for a woman. With bowed heads we beat slowly along\r\nuntil we reached the hog path, and were glad to turn into it and get\r\nunder shelter of the vegetation, which broke the wind and made progress\r\ncomfortable. Neither of my companions had ever been over this road\r\nbefore, and I explained what might be expected from moment to moment as\r\nwe advanced. When we came to the cleft in the rocks where the stream\r\ncame through, Alice and her father were delighted with the romantic and\r\npicturesque beauty of the place; the bold, precipitous rocks, the\r\nstream, the overarching trees growing far above, the dense beds of fern,\r\ntall and feathery, were all duly admired.\r\n\r\nWhen we emerged into the north valley, we found a great herd of pigs\r\nthat scattered and ran wildly at our approach. I managed to lasso a\r\nlittle porker, just old enough to roast, which we proposed to have for\r\ndinner. The orange grove was as before plentifully laden with oranges in\r\nall stages of growth, many of them quite ripe, a delicious refreshment.\r\nWe soon reached the house, and building a fire in the broad fireplace of\r\nthe kitchen, spitted the porker in front of it, and leaving him to twirl\r\nslowly before the fire on a twisting cord, we wandered over the old\r\ngarden and plantation, Alice and I often hand in hand. I felt sure that\r\nshe was pleased at my undisguised attention to her comfort, and that it\r\ngave her pleasure to be with me; and this in turn gave me unspeakable\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nWe were among the bananas and plantains seeking some of the latter to\r\nbake as an accompaniment for our dinner of roast pig, when I heard what\r\nsounded like the distant report of a gun. The sound was so faint and\r\ndistant that I could not be entirely sure of my impressions, until I had\r\nasked Alice,--\r\n\r\n“Did you hear that?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she replied, “it sounded as though somebody had fired a pistol\r\nfar away over yonder on the high land.”\r\n\r\nWe listened intently several minutes for a repetition of the sound, but\r\nas we heard nothing the impression soon passed away; for our\r\nconversation, however uninteresting it would seem if written down, was,\r\nI assure you, of most absorbing interest, at least to me, though we\r\ntalked of nothing in particular, and like children laughed at everything\r\nout of mere high spirits. We went now with our plantains to the house,\r\nwhere Mr. Millward was gone to look after the roast. He came out to meet\r\nus, smiling at our evident enjoyment as he heard the merry ringing\r\nlaughter of his daughter, over some nonsense or other I had been putting\r\ninto words. As we all three stood in the shadow of the great veranda,\r\nupon its brick pavement, between the joints of which the rank vegetation\r\nwas sprouting, I heard again, and this time borne on the wind quite\r\ndistinctly, two shots in quick succession. There was no mistaking the\r\nsound this time. I saw instantly in the faces of both my companions that\r\neach had heard the unusual sound. Mr. Millward cried quickly: “A gun!\r\nwho can be firing a gun on the island?”\r\n\r\n“What can this mean?” thought I. And again we listened, but there was no\r\nrepetition of the report.\r\n\r\n“Somebody besides ourselves is on the island,” said Mr. Millward.\r\n\r\nWe stood now looking at each other in silence for several minutes. My\r\nmind reverted at once to the pearl-fishers. They had doubtless returned,\r\nand the shots we had heard indicated that they were pig-hunting. The\r\nsame thought had occurred to Mr. Millward, and he immediately expressed\r\nhis fear that the pearl-fishers had come back. Indeed, it did not need\r\nany great power of divination to determine this, because the chances\r\nwere as a hundred to one against any other visitors. All the picnic and\r\nholiday hilarity of our excursion was over. We were full of anxiety and\r\ncare at once. The probability was that we had neighbors, of a most\r\nundesirable character,--lawless adventurers who would have small respect\r\nand consideration for us if we stood in their way, or even if they\r\nthought so. If they discovered that we had surprised their secret it was\r\nimpossible to say what they might do. I had often thought of the\r\ncontingency which now apparently presented itself, and had cogitated\r\nmuch and to no purpose as to what I should do when it arose. And now the\r\nthing so long feared as a possibility was actually upon us. Unexpectedly\r\nat the last it came like a skeleton to mar our happy feast. We hurried\r\nthrough our dinner in anxious mood and immediately started back home,\r\nladen with the fruit we had collected.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached home everything was as we had left it. There had been,\r\nso far as we could tell, no visitor in our absence. We arrived about\r\nthree o’clock in the afternoon. I was restive with the uncertainty and\r\nanxiety that the sound of those three gunshots had occasioned. I felt\r\nthat I must know speedily the exact truth. Our own personal safety, to\r\nsay nothing of the treasure ship, was possibly involved, and I\r\ndetermined to go at once to Farm Cove, where they would probably be\r\nencamped, and reconnoitre the enemy secretly. Of course there would be\r\ndanger of encountering the pig-hunter, or party of pig-hunters on the\r\nway, but I must endeavor by caution to avoid this. When I announced my\r\nintention both Mr. Millward and Alice opposed my going; but I was able\r\nvery soon to convince them that it was necessary.\r\n\r\nAbout four o’clock I started alone, not permitting the dog to accompany\r\nme. I took the small axe from Mr. Millward’s boat, my lasso, some food,\r\nand a small gourd of water slung as a canteen over my shoulder. I told\r\nthem I might not return until the next day; but that if I did not get\r\nback before the next night they might conclude I had been captured; and\r\nin that event it would be wise for them to embark in their boat and make\r\nthe best of their way to Martinique. But Mr. Millward proposed a better\r\nplan, which was that if I did not return by the next night, he and\r\nAlice, provided the weather was such as to permit it, would take both\r\nboats out of the creek and anchor just beyond the breakers, and wait\r\nthere another day. This was such an excellent idea that I at once agreed\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nBidding them farewell I plunged into the forest and made my way\r\ncautiously to the central elevated plateau, climbing the rocks by the\r\npath which I had first ascended. Here the open nature of the growth made\r\nthe utmost caution indispensable, for I might at any moment now come\r\nupon the visitors, if they were still out pig-hunting. It was necessary\r\nthat I should see them before they saw me. This made my progress very\r\nslow. Looking carefully about in every direction, and listening for\r\nevery sound, I advanced a hundred yards or so and repeated the\r\nobservation, concealing myself as thoroughly as the nature of the ground\r\npermitted. On the connecting ridge between the central plateau and the\r\nshore cliffs I came upon convincing evidence of the presence of visitors\r\non the island. Here a pig had been killed and disembowelled. The viscera\r\nstill fresh lay upon the ground, and a broad mark where the carcass had\r\nbeen dragged along led away toward the shore cliffs in the direction of\r\nFarm Cove. I had now little doubt that I should find the visitors at\r\nthat place. It was fully an hour before sunset, and I thought it best to\r\nconceal myself and wait until dark before advancing further. I secreted\r\nmyself therefore amid a thick clump of ferns, and patiently waited for\r\nthe friendly shelter of the night.\r\n\r\nAs I sat thus buried in the ferns among the moss-grown rocks, looking\r\nout through a break in the forest toward the southern sky, where lay a\r\nbattlemented mass of sun-dyed cloud, heavy and fantastic in outline,\r\nthere passed through my mind thoughts of the life and curious adventures\r\nof that Henry Morgan, my ancestor’s brother, who two hundred years ago\r\nhad roamed these seas and besieged the Spanish strongholds. Fancy\r\npictured in the tinted clouds the fortified city of Porto Bello, the\r\nseaport of Panama on the Atlantic side of the isthmus, which the\r\nintrepid Morgan attacked with four hundred and sixty of his men, having\r\nresolved to reduce this strongly fortified place as a preliminary to the\r\ncapture of the rich city of Panama itself. There was in my mind the\r\nvision of the gray walls, the gorgeous banners, the smoke and roar of\r\nguns, the white-faced priest and pale nuns looking from the convent\r\nwalls, the scaling-ladders, the grim, determined Anglo-Saxon sailors,\r\nmingled with the equally determined Dutch and the black-bearded\r\nFrenchmen, constituting Morgan’s little band. I could see in fancy the\r\nflashing, blood-stained blades, and hear the hoarse battle-cry. I could\r\neven fancy my ancestral uncle himself, broad-shouldered and commanding\r\nin appearance as he needs must have been, standing, fire-balls in hand,\r\non the scaling-ladder, grimy with powder, and with his face set toward\r\nthe doomed city. There must have been something more than mere brute\r\nforce in this great leather-clad ancestral uncle of mine with his\r\nflashing eyes and sturdy figure; for did he not control absolutely at\r\none time all this region; conquer the all-conquering Spaniard; quell\r\nmutinies among his reckless followers with ease; lead them without food\r\nacross the fever-stricken isthmus, travelling amid inconceivable\r\nobstacles ever onward until they were actually reduced to eating their\r\nleathern doublets; then with this starved crew did he not besiege and\r\ncapture the rich city of Panama? When a mutiny rose and some of his\r\ndesperate followers threatened to desert him for a piratical cruise in\r\none of the captured ships, Morgan, like Hernando Cortez, but with his\r\nown hand, chopped down the masts and rigging. Ah, there must have been a\r\nspirit in this man greater than a mere piratical thirst for blood. Then\r\ntoo, did not his sovereign, Charles II., bestow upon him subsequently\r\nthe order of knighthood, make him Sir Henry Morgan, and place him as\r\ngovernor over the island of Jamaica? He died without descendants of his\r\nown, the honors bestowed upon him in the later days of his career are no\r\nlonger remembered, and in the region he once dominated his name is used\r\nto frighten children with. He is now remembered only as a buccaneer, a\r\nname almost synonymous with “pirate;” a dauntless, reckless,\r\nblood-thirsty, unconquerable embodiment of energy and will, brooking no\r\npower near him save his own,--truly a leader of men, but exercising his\r\nleadership to no good purpose. Though he once controlled the Spanish\r\nmain, we fail to see it recorded that he ever did good to any man.\r\n\r\nHere was I now, two hundred years later, perhaps the sole surviving\r\nrepresentative of his family, his sole heir, seeking to recover a\r\ntreasure that he conquered, a treasure which I had already brought up\r\nfrom the depths of the sea, and which only waited to be possessed. I\r\nfelt the old spirit of the dead Morgans fire my heart at the thought of\r\nthe possible intervention of a crew of lawless pearl-fishers to snatch\r\nthe prize from my grasp. The treasure was mine, doubly mine,--first by\r\nconquest of one to whom I was heir; and secondly by right of discovery\r\nand recovery from the sea. “No! by the Eternal, they shall not have it!”\r\nI cried, half aloud. “By the bones of my all-conquering ancestor, they\r\nshall never have an ounce of it, not so much as a glimpse of it!”\r\n\r\nWhen it grew dark I resumed my progress toward Farm Cove, stealing along\r\nas cautiously as I could over the somewhat broken way. Every few steps I\r\nwould pause and listen. It was dark as a pocket, and the cloudy sky was\r\nscarcely discernible. But still, by keeping the wind on my right cheek\r\nit was not difficult to preserve the proper direction, and I knew that\r\nhowever dark the night, the sea would be visible when I reached the\r\ncliffs, just as the sky was faintly distinguishable now through the\r\nblack foliage above me.\r\n\r\nIt took me fully an hour to cover the comparatively short distance that\r\nremained, and it was not done without several falls on the way; but\r\nfortunately I made no great noise, though an occasional dry branch would\r\nbreak under foot with a sharp crack, which in the stillness sounded\r\nalarmingly loud to my tense senses. In due course, groping along, I came\r\nto the cliffs and could see the faint glimmer of the water through the\r\nfoliage. Then as I parted some branches I caught sight of the red\r\nreflection of a fire on the leaves below, then the bright blaze of the\r\nfire itself, and a canvas tent which was lighted by it. Increased\r\ncaution was now demanded. It would not do to step on a dry branch now,\r\nso at each step I felt cautiously with my foot that nothing might\r\nintervene between it and the ground. Fortunately I came out upon the\r\npath which led down the rocks into the little vale that lay, as I have\r\npreviously described, like a bowl open on one side to the sea and nearly\r\nsurrounded by the cliffs. Down this path I stole cautiously, and was\r\nhalf-way down before the intervening foliage would permit a fair view of\r\nthe encampment.\r\n\r\nAnd now I was almost near enough to hear the conversation that was going\r\non among the people assembled there. Indeed, I could hear the hum of\r\nvoices, but was unable to distinguish words. In the light of the bright\r\nfire I could see four men seated on the ground playing cards on a folded\r\nblanket. They were evidently gambling. One of the four was a\r\nyellow-skinned Chinaman, who sat facing me. Opposite him and with his\r\nback toward me was a great, burly negro, while the other two players\r\nwere dark-skinned, black-haired native Indians or Caribbeans. The game\r\nwas an animated one, and the players were completely absorbed in it.\r\nNear by the fire, seated on a fagot of wood, was a third Indian, his\r\nhead bent forward and resting on his hands as he looked steadily into\r\nthe fire. From where I was located I could not see into the tent, which\r\nconsisted of a square of canvas thrown over a pole and stretched\r\nshed-fashion to the ground, with the opening toward the fire. But I\r\ncould plainly see on the canvas the shadow of a person seated within the\r\ntent. On a limb near by hung distended the dressed carcass of a hog. I\r\ncould just make out that some sort of a craft was moored at the mouth of\r\nthe little stream.\r\n\r\nI watched this scene for several minutes scarce daring to breathe. The\r\nthree Indians, each carrying a long knife in his belt, were, I\r\nconjectured, the divers of the party; the Chinaman was doubtless the\r\ncook; and as for the negro, I could not determine approximately his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the players fell to quarrelling, and one of the Indians, with\r\nan angry cry, sprang up and drew his knife. Instantly the whole party\r\nwas on foot, and I fully expected from their excited manner and attitude\r\nto see blood shed. Just at this juncture the person in the tent--a\r\nman--came quickly out, with a drawn revolver in his hand, and sprang\r\ninto the mêlée, cursing and shouting in a loud, deep voice of command\r\nfor them to desist. He was a broad, compactly built fellow, of forty\r\nyears or thereabouts, evidently possessed of great muscular strength;\r\nfor he was able with his unoccupied hand to seize by the shoulder the\r\nIndian who had drawn the knife, and with one effort send him reeling\r\nbackward almost to the ground.\r\n\r\n“Caramba!” cried he, in guttural Spanish. “Dogs, stop this fighting, do\r\nyou hear? If I find you at it again there shall be no more card-playing.\r\nGo to bed, or keep quiet, you quarrelsome scoundrels.”\r\n\r\nThe fight was over. All seemed alike to fear him, and when I saw his\r\ncountenance in the firelight I could not wonder. It was a dark,\r\npowerful, and passionate face, framed in by a short black beard. Dark\r\nenough for a Spaniard, there was yet something in the countenance that\r\nmade me think he was not of the Latin race; more likely a dark\r\nEnglishman or an American. Perhaps his dress and general appearance\r\ncontributed to this conclusion. He was the only white man in the party,\r\nand that he was master, or chief, did not admit of a doubt.\r\n\r\nNow that I had seen this cut-throat-looking gang and their chief, my\r\napprehension as to what they might attempt if they found us on the\r\nisland and in possession of their pearl-fishing secret was by no means\r\nallayed. As to what would happen if they by any chance should discover\r\nthe galleon, I felt only too certain.\r\n\r\nCrouched down among the dark leafage by the side of the path I remained,\r\na prey to many thoughts, for a quarter of an hour longer, and then stole\r\ncautiously back up the path to the high ground above, and began my\r\nreturn home through the darkness. When I had put a considerable\r\ndistance between me and the party I had left, I began to breathe more\r\nfreely. In the murky darkness I more than once missed the way, and\r\nfinally came out at a place where, though I could plainly hear the\r\nmurmur of the waters of the creek below me, it was impossible to\r\ndescend.\r\n\r\nHowever, by travelling first in one direction and then in the other, I\r\nat last came upon the little gulley which I had before descended, and\r\ngetting down was able to proceed with greater speed along the more\r\nfamiliar route. It was midnight when I at last reached the house and\r\nroused Mr. Millward and Alice to relate to them what I had seen.\r\n\r\nAs we were safe for that night at least, I proposed that we should go to\r\nbed again and get our rest, and discuss our situation in the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPTAIN OF THE GANG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough considerably exhausted by my toilsome tramp and the excitement of\r\nthe reconnoissance, I got very little sleep after I retired to my\r\nhammock that night. Not until near dawn did unconsciousness come; and as\r\nis usually the case under such circumstances, though my mind during\r\nthese hours of sleeplessness dwelt continually on the danger that\r\nthreatened not only our plans but ourselves as well, nothing came of the\r\nthought except added apprehension. There is scarcely ever any good\r\nresult from what may be best termed “worry.” The mind, like the body,\r\nrefuses to act when deprived of its usual rest. One may indeed fancy he\r\nis thinking most deeply, during the still hours of the night when he\r\nshould be sleeping, but in truth such thought is rarely genuine; it is\r\nonly puerile worry, totally lacking in virility and potency to solve\r\nreal difficulties. The fatigued brain like a coward magnifies all\r\nobstacles, and at the same time overlooks their solution, and ignores\r\nthe hopes that rise to illumine the fresh intelligence of the rested\r\nthinker.\r\n\r\nThe consequence was I did not waken in the morning until called to\r\nbreakfast by Alice Millward well on toward eight o’clock.\r\n\r\nThe gale had sunk to a gentle breeze from the same quarter. The bright\r\nblue sky was flecked here and there with high clouds, soft and fleecy\r\nwhite, their shadows a mellow, purple gray. It was a fresh, bright,\r\nbeautiful morning, such as breathes hope and confidence in the\r\napprehensive mind. I immediately began to discount the probabilities of\r\nimpending disaster that had oppressed me, and our talk at the breakfast\r\ntable was all in a hopeful strain. What right had we to suppose the\r\npearl-fishing gang would discover us? It was not probable they would\r\nstay long,--a month or two at farthest,--and there was no telling how\r\nlong they had already been here. They would be busy at their work on the\r\nother side of the island, with nothing to cause them to wander about\r\nexcept the pig-hunting, when they wanted fresh pork. If they should\r\nchance to descend from the central cliffs, they could not see our\r\nhabitation or boats, unless they should happen to come around the island\r\nto the beach above or below us.\r\n\r\nIt behooved us therefore to lie close for the present, and the chances\r\nseemed to favor our escaping notice. By carefully guarding against\r\nraising a smoke during the day with our fires, we should greatly\r\ndiminish the chances of being discovered, and at night we would keep no\r\nfire. We could lower the masts of the boats, and by mooring them a\r\nlittle farther up they would be partly hidden by the willows. So, too,\r\nas to the galleon; unless one actually climbed upon the rocks and looked\r\ndown into the basin, there was nothing in the external appearance of the\r\nplace from sea or shore to denote its existence. The vines I had planted\r\nnow grew most luxuriantly over the shed and the house, so that a casual\r\nobserver from a distance might well fail to distinguish human\r\nhabitations. There was, however, the naked palm tree with its\r\ncross-piece which I had rigged long ago as a distress signal, standing\r\nmost conspicuously. This must come down at once; it would be plainly\r\nvisible at a great distance up and down the beach, and from the sea. A\r\nfew blows of the axe would soon remedy that. Thus we discussed the\r\nsituation; and although bad enough in all conscience to cause us much\r\nmental disturbance, it did not seem without hope.\r\n\r\nAfter arranging our belongings so that they would attract as little\r\nattention as possible, we sat quietly down to await events. We read\r\naloud by turns from Charles Dickens’s beautiful story “Our Mutual\r\nFriend;” Mr. Millward revived his early experiences; we improvised a\r\nchecker-board and finally a set of chess-men, and Mr. Millward and I\r\npondered long over intricate situations arising from Evans gambit.\r\nNevertheless the time hung heavy on our hands, owing to the shadow of\r\nanxiety that was over us. Mention was seldom made of the pearl-fishers,\r\nbut they were always more or less in mind. Thus passed three days,\r\nduring which we heard nothing from the other party on the island.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the fourth day, two hours before dawn, I departed for\r\na second reconnoissance, intending to conceal myself in some place where\r\nI could remain during a portion of the daylight for the purpose of\r\ngetting a better knowledge of our neighbors and their doings. By\r\nstarlight I readily made my way to the cliffs about Farm Cove, and\r\nthere, just as the dawn was breaking, concealed myself in a bed of fern\r\ngrowing among the rocks. From the lay of the land I judged there would\r\nbe no difficulty in seeing the camp from where I was hidden, and such\r\nproved to be the case. By the aid of a glass belonging to Mr. Millward I\r\ncould bring the camp up to an apparent distance not exceeding two rods.\r\n\r\nThe whole party was asleep, so far as I could judge, when I first\r\nobserved them. About an hour after sunrise the Chinaman rose up from his\r\nblanket, and after yawning and stretching himself in sleepy fashion\r\nproceeded to build a fire and cook a breakfast for the party. This was\r\nsoon done, and then he went from one to the other of the sleepers and\r\nroused them. The breakfast for the white man was carried into the tent.\r\n\r\nAfter the eating was over the whole party, except the Chinaman, went\r\ndown to the boat, which was a good-sized sloop, of twice the tonnage of\r\neither of ours, and embarked, pulling out of the creek by a warp laid\r\nout to a buoy for that purpose. They had a good-sized dingy, or better,\r\na yawl, in tow. When they reached the buoy, which was at a distance of\r\nforty rods or thereabouts from shore, they made fast to it, and the\r\nthree Indians with the negro got into the yawl and pulled away a hundred\r\nyards or so to the south, the white man remaining on board the sloop,\r\nwhere I could see him sitting near the tiller smoking a cigar.\r\n\r\nWhen the party in the yawl reached the distance mentioned, the negro\r\nbeing at the oars, they came to a standstill, and I could see the\r\nIndians strip for diving. The operation was wholly new to me and\r\ninteresting. They took turns one after another. The fellow whose turn it\r\nwas to dive got over the side and took hold of a line, to the end of\r\nwhich a great stone was tied, and which was provided with two loops, in\r\nwhich he inserted his feet. When he was all ready one of the other\r\nIndians allowed the rope to pay out rapidly, and down sank the diver\r\ncarrying a sort of bag hung around his neck. After the Indian had been\r\ndown what seemed to me an extraordinary length of time for a man to stay\r\nunder water, he came up without the bag and clung to the side of the\r\nboat seemingly in a state of utter exhaustion. The two Indians in the\r\nboat then helped him on board and he immediately lay down, while his\r\ncompanions hauled up the stone again and brought inboard the bag, from\r\nwhich they emptied perhaps a bushel of great flat oysters. Then another\r\ntook his turn, and so on in rotation, until a considerable heap of the\r\ngreat bivalves, each of which was four or five inches in diameter, was\r\ncollected. These they carried to the sloop and began again, shifting\r\ntheir position a little each time under the direction of the man on the\r\nsloop, who sat watching and smoking the whole time.\r\n\r\nI had heard remarkable stories of the length of time pearl-divers could\r\nremain under water, some accounts putting it as high as ten minutes, and\r\nI was sorry I had no timepiece with me to find out how long the men\r\nbefore me actually stayed down. As a substitute for a more accurate\r\nmethod, I timed them several times by counting my own pulse-beats.\r\nAllowing seventy-five beats to the minute, which I believe was about\r\nright, the longest time I could make out was a little over two minutes.\r\nThe shortness of the time was a surprise to me, for judging from my\r\nuntimed observations the apparent duration was frequently between five\r\nand ten minutes. I think the exaggerated accounts we receive are due to\r\nthe natural tendency of an observer who does not actually measure the\r\ntime to think it longer than it really is.\r\n\r\nThe oyster-gathering thus conducted in my view was a slow business, as\r\nthe divers did not go down oftener than once in fifteen or twenty\r\nminutes, and were seemingly in no hurry to go down at all, though\r\nwilling enough to come up. This was the frequent occasion of rough and\r\nstern command from the man in the sloop, who kept up a more or less\r\nconstant talk across the water with his subordinates. When a diver would\r\ncome up too soon or with a light find, a string of imprecations in\r\nSpanish would greet him; so, too, when one hesitated too long before he\r\nplunged in.\r\n\r\nWhen I had watched this performance for an hour or two I began to think\r\nof getting back home. The Chinaman had finished his work and was seated\r\nat the foot of a tree knitting a white cotton sock, his fingers plying\r\nthe bright steel needles as fast as ever I saw a grandmother do it. He\r\nsat precisely facing my place of concealment, and every now and then\r\nwould look up and around, his needles still going with automatic\r\nregularity. This was very annoying. I did not dare to move so long as he\r\nsat there; for if he should chance to look up while I was scaling the\r\nrock just back of me--a height of perhaps ten feet--to reach the summit\r\nof the cliff, discovery was almost certain. I was obliged, therefore, to\r\nremain where I was.\r\n\r\nIn order to improve the time I examined the interior of the tent with\r\nthe telescope. The only thing I saw of interest there was a\r\ndouble-barrelled breech-loading shot-gun slung to the ridgepole, with a\r\nbelt of cartridges. You may be sure I coveted the possession of this\r\nweapon and its ammunition, and had there been any way to get it, should\r\nnot under the circumstances have hesitated to appropriate it to my own\r\nuse and the defence of my friends. But even if I had succeeded in\r\ngetting it without being seen by the knitting Chinaman its loss would at\r\nonce be discovered and the presence of others on the island immediately\r\nsuspected. I now turned my glass on the Chinaman and soon saw him close\r\nhis eyes while still knitting away. He looked up now no longer, but his\r\nfingers kept on plying the needles. His head gradually sunk upon his\r\nbreast. The man was evidently knitting in his sleep! A moment later his\r\nhands fell into his lap, and after a few more of the automatic movements\r\nbecame still. I lost no further time in climbing back to the summit and\r\ngetting out of sight in the forest, from whence I made my way home\r\nsafely.\r\n\r\nWe continued to lie close at home after this, as before. In order that\r\nno smoke should rise by day we now made a practice of cooking at\r\nnight-time in the fireplace so that the fire would not be visible. We\r\ndid not venture out on the beach at any time during daylight where we\r\nmight be seen from a distance. This life continued thus for a week, and\r\nI had about made up my mind to take another trip to Farm Cove to see if\r\nthe pearl-fishers were still there. This, however, became unnecessary,\r\nfor just as I had reached that conclusion we were informed of the fact\r\nthat the visitors were still present by the sound of several shots from\r\nthe centre of the island.\r\n\r\nTo occupy some of the time that hung so heavy on our hands, Mr. Millward\r\nand I took down the pumping-machine and loaded it on the big boat, to be\r\nin readiness to carry to the basin when we should feel it safe to do so.\r\nWe went out fishing after dark in the smaller boat several times to eke\r\nout our supply of provisions by a stock of fresh fish. One night I was\r\nfortunate enough to turn a fine turtle, which gave us a good supply of\r\nmeat and a plenty of eggs. The latter made a fairly good omelet, but had\r\na slightly unpleasant oily taste.\r\n\r\nThus passed another week of enforced idleness. I cannot deny that the\r\nsociety of Alice Millward proved an ample compensation to me for this\r\ndelay in our plans. We were almost constantly together, and there grew\r\nup between us, I was certain, a perfect feeling of comradeship, even if\r\nit went no further on her part. A thousand times during this period of\r\nintimate association my great love for this sweet girl, who grew sweeter\r\nand dearer as I came to know her better, impelled me to speak to her of\r\nmy regard. But I did not do so. It seemed to me then that by so doing I\r\nmight risk the delight of her companionship. As our present relations\r\nstood we were happy in each other’s friendship. Her beautiful eyes\r\nlooked into mine so frankly and cordially, her hand lay often so\r\nconfidingly in my own, her smile was so friendly and sweet, that I dared\r\nnot risk the utterance of words which, if they found no response in her\r\nown heart, would make mine so desolate. You may perhaps quote to me the\r\nold adage that “faint heart never won fair lady.” But please remember my\r\nsituation. You would not ask a shipwrecked mariner to give up the plank\r\non which he floats; no more could you ask me to risk the only joy I\r\nknew. If there lurked discomfort in the uncertainty, certainty might\r\ndevelop more than discomfort--utter despair. I trust that I am not a\r\ncoward in all things; yet in this thing my heart beat faint at the\r\npossibility of disappointment.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that her father more than half guessed the state of my\r\nheart. But he never said a word to indicate it to me, and I only judged\r\nso from his manner at times; for example, from the fond way in which he\r\nwould look at his daughter, or stroke her hair,--little things which\r\nsuggested to my mind the idea that he thought of the time when another\r\nmight claim her from him. My turbulent heart would beat then at the bare\r\npossibility that I might be that happy man. It must be a great sorrow\r\nfor a loving parent, who tenderly cherished a daughter through helpless\r\ninfancy and childhood, till she blossoms into womanhood, to see her\r\nwooed and won away by a stranger--a sorrow that is not less poignant\r\nbecause untainted by any selfish desire to hinder the loved one from\r\nleaving the home nest, and acquiring new loves and affections which\r\nshall inevitably displace to a great degree the old ones. It is small\r\nconsolation to the heart bereft that it is the course of nature. That\r\ndoes not bring back the lost one. The parent would not have it\r\ndifferent, and yet the grief is there. Akin to this is the fond regret\r\nof the mother who sees with mingled pride and sorrow her babe grow out\r\nof its sweet helplessness. Day by day the little one must seem to become\r\nless and less a part of herself. Her old love may take on a new form,\r\nbut it is not so dear a form.\r\n\r\nOne beautiful morning as we sat in the shed eating a late breakfast and\r\nengaged in a lively conversation concerning the successful manner in\r\nwhich we had evaded the notice of our neighbors at Farm Cove, wondering\r\nif they were still there, and if so how long they would remain, we were\r\nall surprised to see Duke come running into the shed as fast as he could\r\ngo, and plunge under the table with his tail between his legs and a\r\ncowed air about him that was quite strange to the dog. The action was\r\nremarkable, for Duke was a well-bred dog, and this conduct was not only\r\npeculiar but also in very bad form. I got up immediately and looked up\r\nand down the beach. There, not ten rods away and coming straight toward\r\nthe shed, was the chief of the pearl-fishing gang. Positively for a\r\nsecond or two I felt paralyzed. Mr. Millward and Alice were almost\r\nimmediately beside me; and as soon as I could control myself I said to\r\nthem in a low tone, “It is the leader.”\r\n\r\nThe man advanced with a perfectly assured self-possession, and when near\r\ntook off his broad panama hat, bowed with great dignity and no lack of\r\ncourtly grace, saying in Spanish, “The day is better for beholding you.”\r\n\r\n“Good morning, sir,” said Mr. Millward.\r\n\r\n“Ah, very good; you speak English,” said the stranger in our own tongue\r\nand with no trace of foreign pronunciation or accent. “I am glad. It is\r\nmy own language. You will pardon me for intruding upon you. But I only\r\nfollowed my dog which has been lost for some time, and which I have just\r\nfound. He ran into your premises, as you noticed just now.”\r\n\r\n“Then your name must be H. Senlis,” said I to him with as much\r\npoliteness of demeanor as I could command.\r\n\r\n“True, my friend,” replied he, suavely; “no doubt you may read it on the\r\ndog’s collar. H. Senlis is my name, and Duke is my dog. The rascal\r\nmutinied and ran away from me, but that makes him no less my property.”\r\n\r\nHis property was at that moment cowering under the table, looking very\r\nmuch as an escaped convict might at the appearance of his keeper.\r\n\r\n“Of course, Mr. Senlis,” said I, “if the dog is yours, as it seems he\r\nis, we lay no claim to him. He came to us as a stray animal. You have a\r\nright to your property, though we should be sorry to lose him. If you\r\nhad not claimed him it was our intention to carry him away from the\r\nisland soon at our departure.”\r\n\r\n“Poor Duke!” said Alice; “we shall not like to part with him.”\r\n\r\nOff came the panama again with a most profound bow, and he said, “Do not\r\ndistress yourself, lady. It is not my intention or desire to take the\r\ndog from you. It became necessary for me to punish him for\r\ninsubordination. He ran away. He is still in a mutinous mind, and I have\r\nno use for him unless it be to punish him again, and that is hardly\r\nworth the while, as I fear he is incorrigible. Permit me then to\r\nsurrender to you”--another profound bow--“all my right and remaining\r\ntitle in the animal.”\r\n\r\nThe man’s effusive, overdone politeness, the bold, undisguised stare\r\nwhich he gave to Alice, all tended to confuse the girl so that she\r\nanswered nothing to this speech.\r\n\r\nHer father noticing this broke in by saying, “We were just at breakfast\r\nwhen you came up. Will you partake of our fare?”\r\n\r\n“Surely I will, and with much pleasure,” answered the stranger; and\r\nthereupon as we gave way he entered the shed, and when I had procured\r\nhim a seat we all four sat down at the table. As he came in Duke rapidly\r\ndeparted from under the table.\r\n\r\nThe stranger’s appetite appeared to be excellent, judging from the\r\nquantity of baked pork and beans and hot corn bread he disposed of, and\r\nthe gourd of steaming hot coffee he drank.\r\n\r\n“How do you happen to be here?” said he at length to Mr. Millward.\r\n\r\n“We are castaways,” answered the old man, and added, “When I landed here\r\na few months ago I was helpless, unable to move a limb, in short,\r\nparalyzed. But I am recovering, and may say, indeed, that I am now\r\nalmost myself again.”\r\n\r\n“Then you have been here several months,” said the stranger, his eyes\r\nfixed on Mr. Millward.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you remain here, now that you are well? Or is it that you cannot\r\nget away?”\r\n\r\n“Can you assist us to get away?” said Mr. Millward, and I was somewhat\r\namused at the delicate diplomacy of this reply.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the stranger, “it may be possible. I will see what can be\r\ndone. Our boat is rather small and heavily laden. But I will see. I will\r\nsee, and let you know.”\r\n\r\nAt this point I broke in, saying, “When did you land?”\r\n\r\n“We came yesterday,” said he, coolly; “a party of us are here\r\npig-hunting.”\r\n\r\n“There is a great plenty of pigs to be had,” said I, accepting the lie\r\nwithout remark. “When do you intend leaving?”\r\n\r\n“We shall not remain long,--two or three days, or perhaps a week,” said\r\nhe; and after a pause he added, “but I will let you know in time.”\r\n\r\nHe inquired our names, and where we wanted to go; praised the breakfast\r\nunstintedly; bent furtive glances of coarse admiration on Alice from\r\ntime to time; and conducted himself all through with the utmost\r\nassurance.\r\n\r\nWhen we rose from the table and went out on the beach, he drew some\r\nlong, plantation Cuban cigars from his pocket, offered us each one,\r\nwhich we did not refuse, and we began to smoke together.\r\n\r\nPresently he spied on the beach one of the cages of gourds such as we\r\nhad used in raising the galleon,--an extra one, not used. He walked up\r\nto this object and contemplated it for several moments, turning it over\r\nwith his foot.\r\n\r\nFinally he said, “Mr. Millward, I am a good deal puzzled over this\r\nthing. I suppose it was cast up here by the sea. Can you tell me what it\r\nis for?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot, Mr. Senlis.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it is very surprising indeed. In our sloop in the open sea a\r\nhundred miles west of here we came across thousands of these things\r\nfloating in the water--literally thousands of them, all just like this\r\none, four gourds in a willow cage, with a wooden hook at the end of a\r\nline. If it is some sort of fishing-apparatus I don’t understand how it\r\ncould be used. And where did they all come from?”\r\n\r\nThough this made me feel decidedly uncomfortable, I could hardly forbear\r\nlaughing, as the thought of the sea full of gourds, and the puzzle\r\nwhich they would present to a chance navigator, came thus forcibly to\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the thing a moment longer, gave it a vicious kick as though\r\nto punish it for daring to puzzle him, and then turned away.\r\n\r\nMr. Millward then took him to our flourishing garden, and said the\r\nvisitors would be welcome to a supply of fresh vegetables if they\r\ndesired it. A huge bunch of plantains caught the captain’s eye, as it\r\nhung in the porch of the house, and he said, “Do you find plantains on\r\nthe island?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Mr. Millward, “and bananas as well. If you like we can\r\nsupply your party with both.”\r\n\r\n“If we expected to remain long it would be an object. But we shall be\r\ngoing so soon now that it is scarcely worth the trouble.”\r\n\r\nWe then returned to the house at the visitor’s suggestion, and he with\r\nthe most formal courtesy, as though parting with a hostess, took Alice\r\nMillward’s hand and thanked her for his breakfast and said adieu to her\r\nand us.\r\n\r\n“You will hear from me in a day or two, a week at most. In the mean time\r\nI hope you will not disturb the pigs. Perhaps it would be better if you\r\nshould keep away from the higher part of the island entirely, as it\r\nmight drive our game into the lowlands where it would be more difficult\r\nto find.”\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, as though considering something, he added: “Personally, I\r\nshould be pleased to have you visit our camp, which is on the other side\r\nof the island. But I will not now ask you to do so, for the reason that\r\nit will be difficult for me to induce my companions to submit to the\r\ninconvenience that would result from our making room for three\r\nadditional persons in our boat. Perhaps on the whole it would be best\r\nthat they should not know you are here at present, and until I have had\r\nopportunity to prepare them for your reception. I will let you know in\r\ntime. And now farewell until I see you again.”\r\n\r\nWith this he stalked off over the savanna to the southwest, without\r\nagain looking back. The cool, self-possessed manner in which the man had\r\nlied was astonishing. And we were utterly unable to determine his\r\npurpose, beyond the fact that evidently he wanted to conceal the nature\r\nof his business on the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nSELF-BETRAYED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consternation and bewilderment caused to our little party by the\r\npearl-fishing captain’s visit may be better imagined than described.\r\n\r\nThe captain’s burly figure had hardly disappeared when Duke came back\r\nwagging his tail. Alas! poor dog, he little knew the trouble he had\r\ncaused his friends. He came up and laid his head down on Alice’s knee to\r\nbe patted, and made much of her as was his wont.\r\n\r\nOf course we discussed the recent event in all its bearings. The only\r\ndefinite result of the long talk, however, was the general conclusion,\r\nwhich can perhaps be best stated in Mr. Millward’s words, as follows:\r\n\r\n“We are discovered,” he said, “just as we were congratulating ourselves\r\nthat we would not be. The man does not know, however, that we are aware\r\nof the pearl-fishery. He believes, on the contrary, that we are not\r\naware of it. If we are not apprised of his secret he can have no object\r\nin doing us harm. He tells us the first convenient lie that occurs to\r\nhim to gain time to think matters over. However bad he may be in fact,\r\nit is not to be expected that he will go to the length of wantonly\r\nmurdering three people for no purpose; and I feel, therefore, that we\r\nare safe as long as he does not fear that we have discovered his secret.\r\nThat he intends to offer us a passage on his sloop I do not believe at\r\nall. That would be to betray his business here at once; for even if the\r\ngeneral character and appearance of the men and apparatus did not\r\nsuggest it, when we reached port it would inevitably come out. I am\r\ninclined to believe he told the truth when he said that the party did\r\nnot intend to remain long on the island. Now, if we can keep matters as\r\nthey are at present, the gang will doubtless remove all evidence of\r\ntheir occupation, and then quietly leave the island, and leave us to get\r\naway as best we may.”\r\n\r\nThis all seemed reasonable and probable. Our cue, therefore, was plainly\r\nnot to discover the pearl-fishery secret, but to remain quietly at home\r\nand await events, without attempting to invade our neighbor’s privacy.\r\n\r\nThat this was a wise conclusion was made evident that very day in the\r\nafternoon, as follows:--\r\n\r\nIn plain sight of the house and on the skirts of the savanna, or open\r\ngrass-land, there grew a huge silk cotton-tree, with buttressed trunk\r\nand spreading branches. I chanced to be looking that way and noticed a\r\nflock of parrots fly to the tree and then, instead of lighting on its\r\nbranches as they seemed to have intended, break up into a confused body\r\nas though something therein alarmed them, and scatter in all directions.\r\nMy first impression was to go up to the tree, which was perhaps an\r\neighth of a mile distant, to investigate. Then the idea occurred to me\r\nthat the flurry among the birds might have been caused by the captain or\r\nsome of his gang lurking there to spy upon us. To satisfy my mind on\r\nthis point, I went to the house and got Mr. Millward’s glass, and\r\nputting it through a crevice which I cut in the wall for that purpose,\r\nexamined the neighborhood of the distant tree very carefully. Presently\r\nI saw, perched high in the branches, and partly concealed by the\r\nfoliage, so as to be quite invisible to the naked eye, my old\r\nacquaintance the Chinaman. There he was comfortably ensconced among the\r\nlimbs, knitting away at his white sock, just as I had before seen him.\r\nUndoubtedly he was on watch to spy out our doings.\r\n\r\n“Watch on, my celestial friend,” thought I; “we shall endeavor to\r\nconduct ourselves to the eminent satisfaction of your black-whiskered\r\npatron.”\r\n\r\nI reported the discovery of the spy to my companions, and we had a quiet\r\nlaugh to ourselves over the matter. The only thing we did in consequence\r\nof the discovery was to tie up poor Duke in the shed for fear that he\r\nmight find the Chinaman and occasion him some uneasiness of mind. For,\r\nin truth, the fact that the captain had set his Chinaman to watch us was\r\na thing that comforted me amazingly. I reasoned it out in this fashion:\r\nSo long as the captain knew we stayed safely at home, so long would he\r\nfeel that his secret was safe; and so long as he felt his secret safe,\r\nso long would he lack motive to molest us. The spy was a guarantee that\r\nhe would know that we were not spying about ourselves.\r\n\r\nFour days passed thus. Each day I cautiously examined the tree with the\r\nglass, and each time found either the Chinaman or the negro mounted on\r\nguard. Whether they kept up the espionage at night as well as by day I\r\nhad no means for determining satisfactorily. From the actions of the dog\r\nat times I imagined, however, that they did so.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the fifth day of this watch, at about eight o’clock,\r\nwe received a second visit from Captain Senlis. He brought the carcass\r\nof a young pig just killed, and inquired, after a little general\r\nconversation, where the plantains were to be found. I endeavored to tell\r\nhim as plainly as I could where the old plantation was located and how\r\nhe might get there, and finally volunteered to guide him to the hog-path\r\nand put him in the right course to reach the north valley. He remained\r\nwith us half an hour, and then expressed a desire to be guided as I had\r\nsuggested. Now this required that we should cross the creek, and as I\r\nhad no notion of letting him see our boats, we waded over the stream\r\nbreast-deep, and walked on up the beach. When we got to the hog-path I\r\npointed it out to him, and explained that he only needed to follow it\r\nuntil he reached the gorge, and to pass on through the latter into the\r\nvalley; that he would then have no difficulty in finding the fruit\r\ntrees; but that in order to get out of the valley he would be obliged to\r\nreturn through the gorge, as the surrounding cliffs were very\r\nprecipitous. He asked me then suspiciously if I had ever attempted to\r\nscale the cliffs surrounding this valley. I truthfully answered that I\r\nnever had, and indeed, never had occasion to do so.\r\n\r\nHe asked me minutely about the topography of the valley, and I described\r\nit to him as well as I could,--the surrounding wall of cliff, the little\r\nharbor, the buildings, fields, orange groves, etc. He was particularly\r\ninterested apparently in the harbor, and I thought I could readily\r\nunderstand why, though of course I did not hint that I knew he was\r\nthinking of it as a secure place of concealment in the prosecution of\r\nhis future diving operations. At length he started into the path, and I\r\nfollowed for a little way continuing the conversation. When we were well\r\ninto the forest I said I need go no farther, and we parted, he going on\r\nand I returning on the path.\r\n\r\nWhen I came out on the beach it occurred to me that this was an\r\nexcellent opportunity to walk up to the basin and take a look at the\r\ngalleon, to see how she came on. There was nobody in sight, and I was\r\nalready half-way there. I had bitter cause subsequently to regret this\r\nfoolish performance, as you will presently see.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the place I climbed upon the rocks and looked down into\r\nthe basin. There was the galleon peacefully resting in the clear, calm\r\npool, visible from end to end through the transparent water. I stood\r\nthus contemplating this object, so interesting to me, for perhaps a\r\nquarter of an hour, and then came down upon the beach and started home.\r\nI walked quietly along, in no special hurry to be back, entirely without\r\nsuspicion of any misfortune, and thinking of the time when our\r\ntroublesome neighbors would be gone, when suddenly I saw in the damp\r\nsand tracks which I at once recognized as having been made by the feet\r\nof the Chinaman. There was no mistaking these footprints. They could\r\nonly have been made by the peculiar shoe worn by that people. The prints\r\nindicated that he had come diagonally out on to the beach to the edge of\r\nthe water and then run in again toward the forest.\r\n\r\nI took this all in at a glance and read its meaning instantly. The\r\nalmond-eyed spy had followed me up the beach, and here was where he had\r\nrun out to get sight of me as I turned in toward the rocks. No doubt he\r\nhad seen me looking into the basin. I did not pause in my walk, for he\r\nmight even now be watching me; but I edged in slowly toward the jungle\r\nand got out of sight. Then I looked back up the beach, but could see\r\nnothing. Would the Chinaman go up and look into the basin, or would he\r\ncontent himself with simply following me to see that I did not go toward\r\nFarm Cove? I determined to find out. There was nothing in sight. I could\r\nnot go through the jungle, so I came boldly out and ran up the beach\r\nclose to the bushes as fast as I could until I had gone about twenty\r\nrods. By going out to the water I could now see the rocks of the basin.\r\nSo I lay down flat on the sand and rolled out nearly to the water’s\r\nedge. If the Chinaman was there watching he might wonder; but no matter,\r\nI would take that chance. When far enough out I looked toward the rocks,\r\nand saw the spy there at the basin looking in just as I had done. It was\r\nenough. His back was turned. I sprang to my feet and ran back under\r\ncover. Our secret was out now with a vengeance, and all through my own\r\nstupidity. The situation was a desperate one. The treasure seemed in a\r\nfair way to be irretrievably lost. Without arms Mr. Millward and I could\r\nnot cope with the pearl-fishing gang, and it was too much to expect that\r\non this remote island, far from the power of the law, they would respect\r\nour prior right to the cargo of the old vessel which we had brought up\r\nfrom the deep. They would do what they pleased, and would doubtless\r\nspeedily please to go diving in the basin; and we would be powerless to\r\nprevent it.\r\n\r\nWith head bent down I slowly made my way home. There was a gloomy party\r\nthere that day. Of course no one blamed me for the misfortune but\r\nmyself. That was, however, no consolation. I was so fully convinced that\r\nthe truculent Senlis and his gang would seize on the treasure of the\r\ngalleon, that I already counted it almost as good as lost. Still I did\r\nnot entirely despair, and did not intend to give up all effort until the\r\ntreasure was actually gone. But what could we do? Mr. Millward thought\r\nwe could do absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\n“Don’t grieve over spilt milk, my boy,” said he, kindly, in an effort to\r\nsoothe my terrible disappointment. “There are far greater sorrows in\r\nthis world than the mere loss of money.”\r\n\r\nAlice, too, was full of sympathy, and put her hand on my shoulder\r\nwithout a word. But I could read well enough in her face what she would\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nNo one could suggest any plan of action except that now it might perhaps\r\nbe quite as well for us to embark and leave the island and the dangerous\r\nneighborhood of the captain and his crew. But I was not willing to do\r\nthis until I knew with definiteness what were his intentions. We finally\r\nconcluded that as soon as it was dark we would get the boats ready and\r\ngo out to sea, where we could watch proceedings in safety.\r\n\r\nAbout four o’clock in the afternoon the captain came sauntering down the\r\nbeach. I knew quite well that he had seen the galleon, or at least the\r\ninference that the Chinaman had reported it to him was almost certain.\r\nBut though he crossed the creek and came to the shed where we were all\r\nseated and talked with us a while, he said not a word concerning the\r\nsubject that was uppermost in all our minds. Could it be possible the\r\nChinaman had not told him? No; I could dismiss that idea from my mind;\r\nit was too improbable. He knew of the wreck, and moreover he knew that I\r\nknew of it. His present demeanor was simply the outcome of his naturally\r\nsecretive disposition. But there was one thing he did not know, and I\r\ndid not intend to let him know it. And that was the fact that we were\r\naware he knew of the galleon. So I said nothing that would lead him to\r\nsuspect that I had been watching his spy; nor did the others.\r\n\r\nThe man’s deceitful nature, which I well comprehended by this time,\r\ncoupled with the offensive air of gallantry which he exhibited toward\r\nAlice Millward, together with the fact that I felt sure he intended to\r\noverhaul the galleon and seize upon the fruits of our tremendous labor,\r\nmade me feel as though I should like to have it out with him there and\r\nthen. And the effort I was obliged to make to control my feelings did\r\nnot add to my comfort while he stayed. I was very glad, as we all were,\r\nwhen he left.\r\n\r\nJust before sunset I strolled into the grove of cocoanuts about half a\r\nmile from the house, on no special errand but just idly thinking over\r\nthe condition into which our affairs had drifted. I was so absorbed in\r\nmy own thoughts that for the time I had forgotten our determination to\r\nstay close at home. As I was standing near a tall palm, with my hands in\r\nmy pockets, I was rudely awakened from my revery by the whistle of a\r\nbullet close to my head, and the report of a pistol following\r\nimmediately after. I got behind the tree in short order and watched to\r\nsee if I could discover the author of this wanton attack. That it was\r\nthe captain or some of his gang I had no doubt; most probably it was the\r\ncaptain, for so far as I knew he was the only one who carried firearms.\r\n\r\nI waited where I was for half an hour, until the dusk had come, and then\r\nwent home. I did not tell of this adventure just then, as it was not\r\nnecessary to make my friends feel uneasy. They had heard the shot, but\r\nattached no special importance to it. This deliberate attempt to murder\r\nme made me feel strongly the danger of our remaining longer on shore. I\r\nhad no right on any account to subject Alice and her father for a moment\r\nmore to the tender mercies of such a gang of cutthroats. Let the galleon\r\nand its treasure go if necessary, we must put to sea at once. The full\r\nmoon would rise by nine o’clock, and as we wanted to be off shore before\r\nthat time, we had to hurry our preparation. The boats were fortunately\r\nboth provided with a supply of fresh water in gourds, which would keep\r\nsweet, and it did not take us long to put our provisions on board,\r\ntogether with such things as we thought we might need for a voyage. The\r\nmasts were down in both boats, having been lowered for the purpose of\r\nconcealment. We were obliged, therefore, to have recourse to our oars,\r\nrowing the large boat and towing mine after it. We had forgotten Duke,\r\nbut he came swimming after us just as we were about to leave the creek,\r\nand I helped him on board. As I did so my hand came in contact with his\r\ncollar. I stopped the boat and took this collar off, for the reason that\r\nit bore the name of Senlis, and dropped it overboard into the sea. I\r\nsmile when I think of the childish performance; but it seemed to me then\r\nthat I could not bear to have anything near me pertaining to the\r\ntruculent knave. And I have no doubt that Duke also felt delighted, and\r\nwith much more reason. My companions both noticed the act, but said\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nJust as we got beyond the rollers I made out in the darkness the figure\r\nof a man running down to the beach. I knew he could see us better than\r\nwe could see him.\r\n\r\n“Pull, Mr. Millward!” I cried; “they are after us. Get down in the\r\nbottom of the boat Alice, quick! they may shoot.”\r\n\r\nThe words were hardly out of my mouth when three pistol-shots were fired\r\nin rapid succession, and the balls whistled close by us. From the flash\r\nI thought I could make out the captain as the murderous assailant.\r\n\r\nHe did not fire again and we were soon out of range, and casting anchor\r\nbegan the work of setting up the masts and rigging. The light of the\r\nmoon, which soon rose, showed nobody on the beach. It was almost light\r\nenough to read coarse print, and this facilitated our work greatly. As\r\nsoon as the boats were in sailing trim we stood off to the north with a\r\ngentle breeze coming from the south. By midnight we were off the north\r\ncape, and here we cast anchor in plain sight of the rocks surrounding\r\nthe galleon basin and in such a position that we could see the\r\npearl-divers’ boat long before it could come within gunshot, if it\r\nshould put to sea and attempt to round the cape.\r\n\r\nI now told my companions of the narrow escape I had had at the cocoanut\r\ngrove, which, owing to more recent events, was no surprise to them.\r\n\r\nWe arranged to keep a watch as follows: I would take the first watch\r\nuntil two o’clock; then Alice would watch until four, and Mr. Millward\r\nuntil six, and then I would take another turn while they slept in the\r\nmorning. Alice insisted on taking her share of this duty.\r\n\r\nMr. Millward rolled himself up in the bottom of the boat and in five\r\nminutes was sound asleep. Alice and I sat in the stern sheets together.\r\nShe insisted she was not sleepy, and wanted to change the order of the\r\nwatches agreed upon, and to take the first watch herself. This I would\r\nnot let her do, as I had determined if she went to sleep not to waken\r\nher. I could not persuade her to lie down. We sat silently thus for half\r\nan hour, when I saw that she had fallen asleep. I gently drew her toward\r\nme that she might rest with some comfort, and held her thus unconscious\r\nin my arms, the moonlight falling softly upon her sweet, pale face. I\r\nfelt that here was a treasure to console me for the loss of the galleon.\r\n\r\nThe long, heaving swell rocked us gently, and the soft plash of the\r\nwater against the boat sung a lullaby. More than once I found my heavy\r\neyelids about to close. Then I would rouse myself up, for fear of\r\ndisturbing the dear burden that rested upon me, and look about. Nothing\r\ncame in sight. I could see the rocks where lay the galleon; the long\r\nline of breakers down the beach; the sea stretching clear to the\r\nhorizon on all sides except where the island obstructed the view; the\r\nshore and foliage lit up by the silvery light of the moon; but no sign\r\nof our interesting neighbors. The hours passed on until three o’clock\r\nand after. One after another the constellations moved down to the\r\nwestern sky line, and still Alice slept peacefully on.\r\n\r\nAt last she moved uneasily and seemed about to awaken. I wanted very\r\nmuch to let her head gently down upon the seat, that she might not know\r\nhow she had been sleeping, but my attempt to do this wakened her fully;\r\nand she at once realized the whole situation.\r\n\r\nI said then, speaking low that her father might not be wakened, “Alice,\r\nnever mind, you have been sleeping.”\r\n\r\nShe looked up at me in a startled way and blushed until the flush was\r\nvisible in the moonlight.\r\n\r\nAgain I said, gently, “Never mind about it, you have been sound asleep.\r\nPray don’t distress yourself.”\r\n\r\nThen how it came about I do not exactly know, and perhaps should not\r\ncare to analyze it here at any rate. In her sweet confusion, while lying\r\nthus in my arms, I put my lips to hers, and pressed her to my heart.\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty was gone, never to return. My dear Alice was mine, mine\r\nalone. I had rescued a treasure, indeed, from the sea. Ah! do you know\r\nwhat it means, this finding out your true love? If you do, then no need\r\nfor me to write it down; if you do not, then mere lifeless words cannot\r\npaint to you the pure delight, the flood of hope and fond emotion.\r\n\r\nOf course we had much to talk about, as lovers do, and we sat talking\r\nlow until the gray dawn stole into the eastern sky heralding the sun. I\r\nlearned a good deal in that time. Perhaps the most instructive lesson\r\nwas when Alice drew forth my old stained visiting card, and showed it to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nJust before sunrise the old man woke up from his sound sleep, and came\r\naft to where I was sitting with my arm around his daughter.\r\n\r\nI lost no time in telling him what had passed between us.\r\n\r\n“Is it so, Alice?” said he, putting his hand on her head tenderly and\r\nturning her face up toward his.\r\n\r\n“Yes, father.”\r\n\r\n“Well”--after a long pause, and sighing--“I suppose it is only natural.”\r\nThen turning to me he laid his other hand on my shoulder, and said: “My\r\nboy, you may be thankful to have such a wife. She will prove to you what\r\nher dear mother was to me. I thought I could see this coming, but it is\r\nhard to lose my little girl.”\r\n\r\nHe then sat down beside us, and after a little silence said: “Now, my\r\nchildren, we are all here together. You have made up your minds to love\r\neach other. It will please me that you should love each other well; the\r\nmore the better. And I want you to take me into the partnership. I am an\r\nold man, and I cannot lose my daughter. She is all I have on earth. Make\r\na place for me, my son, in your heart, as I have already made a place\r\nfor you. And you, Alice, love him with all your heart, and do not feel\r\nthat I am an outsider, or my presence a hindrance to you. Often have I\r\ntried to console other parents by saying they gain a son when they lose\r\na daughter. Now I am called upon to console myself. I may do it by\r\nloving you both.”\r\n\r\nI was much affected by the old man’s earnest manner and the deep feeling\r\nthat trembled in his voice. I took his hand in mine and pressed it\r\nfervently. Alice threw her arms about his neck and passionately declared\r\nno one could take his place in her heart.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose upon this scene, and his level beams shone upon us with a\r\nflood of golden light. A bright new day had dawned for me in more senses\r\nthan one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPTAIN’S FATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout ten o’clock in the morning we had the first news of our neighbors.\r\nCaptain Senlis, the negro, and the three Indians at that hour came\r\nwalking up the beach from the direction of our house. The negro had a\r\ncoil of rope over his shoulder, and one of the Indians carried a water\r\njug. It was plainly an expedition to view the galleon. When they came in\r\nsight the negro pointed out our boats, and they all paused a moment to\r\nlook at us, as we swung at anchor just beyond range from the nearest\r\npoint of the shore.\r\n\r\nWe were curious to know what would be their method of procedure with\r\nreference to the galleon. In view of the vast amount of incrustation of\r\nshells and coral, it would be no very easy task even for the\r\npearl-divers to get at the contents of the old ship by diving and\r\nbreaking into the hull. That such was their design I conjectured from\r\nthe fact that the captain carried an axe, and one of the Indians an iron\r\nbar. When they had reached the rocks I took Mr. Millward’s glass, and\r\nclimbed the mast of the sloop to the cross-trees, where I could have a\r\nfooting, and from which I could just see over the edge of the\r\nbreakwater, and get a glimpse of the surface of the water in the basin,\r\nfor about half its extent.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the rocks all five stood looking down into the basin\r\nfor some time, the Indians pointing now and then, and the captain and\r\nthe negro holding conversation together. Then they all came down into\r\nthe breakwater. One of the Indians began to prepare himself for a dive,\r\ngreasing his body with oil from a bottle and plugging up his nose and\r\nears, in the slow, methodical way that I had before observed, and with\r\nthe same apparent reluctance. When he was ready he sat down on the sand\r\nwith such an air of indifference and disinclination to proceed that I\r\ncould not help smiling. Then the captain began to gesticulate and talk\r\nin a way that made it plain, though of course at that distance I could\r\nnot hear a word, that he was cursing the poor Indian at a stormy rate.\r\nThere seemed to be some sort of hitch or difficulty in affairs. The two\r\nother Indians came up to the captain and began to talk to him. From the\r\ndistant pantomime I fancied they were endeavoring to convince him that\r\nthe rock at the shore side would be a better place to work from than the\r\nlow breakwater. But this the captain would not see. He presently went up\r\nto the seated Indian and pushed him on the shoulder; but the man only\r\nlooked stolidly. The captain then threw off his coat, kicked off his\r\nshoes, and plunged into the basin. He evidently intended to swim to the\r\nwreck, and stand on the higher portions of it. It required only a few\r\nstrokes for a powerful swimmer such as he would doubtless be.\r\n\r\nBut the unfortunate man never reached the galleon. After he had plunged\r\nin he was hidden from my view by the breakwater. My glass was levelled\r\ncarefully on the scene, and the whole of it was in the field. I expected\r\nalmost instantly to see his burly figure rising from the three or four\r\nfeet of water that covered the poop of the galleon, but he did not\r\nappear. Not only did he fail to appear, but there arose immediately the\r\ngreatest excitement among the others. The Indians began to throw up\r\ntheir arms and shout and to cast stones into the basin. The negro\r\ncovered his face with his hand as though to shut out some fearful sight.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of all this did not penetrate to my mind at once. I could\r\nnot understand the disappearance of the captain. But the conduct of the\r\nIndians, in their shouting and stone-throwing, led me presently to\r\nconjecture the real state of the case. It was the imprisoned shark. I\r\nnow recollected that he lay in the basin like a sentinel guarding the\r\ngalleon. The captain had been attacked by the fish, and probably killed.\r\nThe conduct of his followers would soon determine this. Mr. Millward\r\ncalled up to me to know what the evident excitement meant. In a moment\r\nmore I caught a glimpse of what seemed a blood stain on the surface of\r\nthe pool, though of course I could not be sure; for while the glass\r\nbrought the view up to an apparent distance of not over ten rods, still\r\nthere was a certain glimmer due to the refraction of the light which\r\nmade such a thing as a discoloration of the water an extremely difficult\r\nthing to see. But putting all together,--the disappearance of the\r\ncaptain, the fact that the shark was there, and finally the conduct of\r\nthe remaining members of the party,--I felt morally certain that he had\r\nmet his fate in a horrible death from the treacherous fish. If such was\r\nthe case (and there seemed to be no escape from the conclusion) I felt\r\nsure there would be no further attempts made by the party to get at the\r\nwreck until they could get rid of the shark. I told my companions what I\r\nhad seen and my conclusions drawn therefrom, and they agreed with the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nI came down on deck, as we could watch the doings of the party on the\r\nrocks quite well from there, though we could not see into the basin.\r\n\r\nThe three Indians and the negro were now gathered together in a group on\r\nthe rock, evidently engaged in a consultation. Presently the negro\r\nstarted off down the beach toward Home Creek, and the Indians remained\r\nat the rock. We immediately concluded that he had gone to their camp to\r\nget a shark hook, or the gun, or some means of destroying the man-eater.\r\nI at once made up my mind that we did not want our sentinel destroyed,\r\nand that the only way to prevent it was to reach the camp ahead of the\r\nnegro, and get possession of the shotgun and ammunition. There would be\r\nno one at Farm Cove now except possibly the Chinaman, who would be left\r\nthere as a guard to the property. I recollected his propensity for\r\nknitting and sleeping, and thought it possible to catch him napping if I\r\ncould arrive there before the negro. He would require over two hours to\r\ngo, and would most likely sail back in the pearl-fishers’ sloop, and\r\nwould then be in a position, with the gun, to make the neighborhood too\r\nwarm for us. I determined to be beforehand with him if possible. I could\r\ndo this by sailing down to Farm Cove in my boat, along the west coast,\r\nwhich would not take longer than an hour. The Chinaman, if he should be\r\nkeeping a bright lookout, which was not very likely, would not be\r\nexpecting anybody from the sea. The chances of success in the enterprise\r\nseemed more than even.\r\n\r\nI explained the plan to Alice and her father, and the necessity that\r\nexisted for speed and promptness in its execution. After much\r\nhesitation, particularly on Alice’s part, they finally agreed that the\r\nmove was a proper and advisable one. I immediately cast loose the\r\n“Mohawk” and made sail, leaving the Millwards and their boat at anchor.\r\nAs I parted from them I told Mr. Millward to keep a bright lookout, and\r\nif he should see the pearl-fishers’ sloop coming before my boat, to\r\nweigh anchor and stand to the north, and then make his way as best he\r\ncould to Martinique, and assured him that I would follow in my own boat\r\nif I came to no harm. The wind was light, and had shifted so that I had\r\nit fairly on the port beam, and made satisfactory speed on the way. I\r\nwould have at least a half-hour to spare before the negro could make the\r\ndistance by land, the route he was taking, and probably an hour, unless\r\nhe made more haste than I believed he felt occasion to do.\r\n\r\nWhen I came nearly opposite the cove I bore up close-hauled and headed\r\nfairly for the sloop, which lay moored at the mouth of the little\r\nstream, and came boldly in. If the Chinaman should be at the tent the\r\nintervening foliage would prevent him from seeing me, and if he was on\r\nboard the sloop, which was not likely, I would soon see him. When I drew\r\nup alongside the sloop, keeping the sails full to prevent their flapping\r\nin the slight breeze, I found it deserted, and immediately made fast\r\nleaving my sails hoisted ready for a rapid retreat if it should be\r\nrequired. Now the greatest caution became necessary. If the Chinaman was\r\nat the camp I must see him before he saw me. Moreover, I conceived that\r\nthere was no time to spare even if I had a full hour before me.\r\n\r\nFrom my previous visits and observations the lay of the land was\r\nperfectly familiar to me. The best way to reach the tent would be to\r\nfollow up the creek, where I would be screened from view by the\r\noleanders that grew on its banks. This would necessitate swimming for a\r\nfew rods just at the mouth, and I felt a little nervous at the\r\nrecollection of the recent shark episode, but rightly concluded that the\r\nsharks could not be very plentiful hereabouts, or the diving could not\r\nhave been carried on. Without delay I slipped gently over the side into\r\nthe water and swam in until my feet found bottom. It grew rapidly\r\nshallow now until the water was soon only ankle-deep in the little\r\nnarrow rivulet. Cautiously advancing I soon came to a point where the\r\ntent was visible. The gun and ammunition hung in their old place, but no\r\nChinaman could be seen. The stream took a bend here, and by following it\r\ncompletely round I could gain a spot within a couple of rods of the\r\ntent. This I safely reached and looked around again for the Chinaman,\r\nbut he was not to be seen. I then waited, watched, and listened for\r\nfully five minutes, but could get no trace or sign of him. The gun was\r\nso near that I then made up my mind to make a bold dash for it. If I\r\ncould get hold of the gun I did not care for the Chinaman. With this\r\nintent I started on a run straight for the tent before me.\r\n\r\nI had not taken three steps before my foot came down exactly upon the\r\ncelestial lying flat on his back asleep in the grass. I must have\r\nknocked the wind out of him completely, as my foot backed up by my whole\r\nweight struck him fairly in the pit of the stomach. He squirmed and\r\nstruggled up to a sitting posture, but did not cry out nor make any\r\neffort to stop me. Indeed, I believe the fellow could not have cried out\r\nto save his life after the foul blow he had received in the diaphragm.\r\n\r\nI turned to look at him as I ran on, but did not pause until I had the\r\nweapon in my hands, a cartridge in both barrels, and the belt of\r\nammunition buckled around my waist. I was now master of the situation,\r\nas I supposed. I looked around the tent to see if there were any other\r\nfirearms, but could see none. My back was momentarily turned towards the\r\nprostrate foe, when a curious whistling sound caught my ear, and\r\ninstinctively I wheeled quickly around just in time to escape a knife\r\nwhich he had thrown at my back with all the dexterity of a juggler.\r\nInstantly I covered him with the gun, and there never was a Chinaman\r\nnearer death, who lived to tell it, than this yellow scoundrel at that\r\nmoment. My finger was on the trigger, when he threw himself face down\r\nflat on the grass with his arms stretched toward me, the palms together.\r\nIt was not worth while nor did I want to kill him, I reflected in a\r\nmoment, and moreover I did not care to fire the gun, for there was no\r\ntelling how near the negro might be. So, keeping an eye upon him as long\r\nas I could see him lying there, I hurried down to the boats. Just as I\r\nreached the place where they were moored I caught a glimpse of the\r\nlight-blue blouse of the Chinaman as he ran swiftly up the path toward\r\nthe top of the cliffs.\r\n\r\nAs I have before stated, the pearl-fishers had laid a warp from the\r\nshore to a buoy anchored well out, which they used to haul the sloop in\r\nand out by. I hastily cast off the shore end of this warp, which was\r\nfast to a tree, and taking it on board the pearl-fishers’ sloop hauled\r\nthat vessel, my own, and the pearl-fishers’ yawl, all three, out to the\r\nbuoy. I then made shift to haul up the anchor by aid of a winch on the\r\npearl-fishers’ craft, and left it hanging at the bow, cutting loose the\r\nbuoy. We now began to drift, and I took a line to my own boat\r\npreparatory to towing the entire flotilla. All this had occupied some\r\ntime, and just as I was fairly under way I saw the Chinaman and the\r\nnegro run down to the mouth of the creek. The black fairly danced with\r\nanger, and shouted out curses loud and deep after me, to all of which I\r\nmade no reply, but getting the sails on my boat trimmed, jogged slowly\r\nalong with my heavy tow safe behind. I felt now for the first time since\r\nour disagreeable neighbors had come on the island that the game was once\r\nmore in our hands.\r\n\r\nAbout one o’clock the boat of the Millwards hove in sight, and knowing\r\nhe would have his glass bearing on me I stood up in the stern sheets\r\nthat he might plainly see all was right. By three o’clock we were once\r\nmore together, and all three boats at anchor, in plain sight of the\r\nIndians on the rock, who exhibited the utmost excitement when they saw\r\nme towing up their sloop. In a little while afterward the negro and the\r\nChinaman came up to the beach and joined the rest of their party.\r\n\r\nHaving no fear now of firearms, we had brought all the boats to anchor\r\nmuch nearer the shore, so that we were now in easy hailing distance of\r\nthe shore party. After a talk with his companions the negro came out\r\nalone to the nearest point on the rocks and called to us in “darky”\r\nEnglish. When I had answered his hail, he said “Wharfor you done tek our\r\nboat, boss? How you reckon we kin git off dis hyar island with no boat?”\r\n\r\n“Do you want to leave the island?” said I.\r\n\r\n“Yes boss, de captain’s dead, eat up by shark. We don’t want to stay\r\nhyar no longer. Fore de Lawd, I speak true.”\r\n\r\n“Tell the rest to come where you are,” said I.\r\n\r\nWhen they had all gathered there and stood in a row, I asked them in\r\nSpanish if they wanted to go, and they all began to speak at once. Then\r\nI motioned for silence, and bade them each to speak in turn, the\r\nright-hand man first, who happened to be the Chinaman. He wanted to go,\r\nand one after another they said the same.\r\n\r\n“If I let you have the boat will you sail straight away, and leave here\r\nfor good and all?”\r\n\r\nTo this they all assented except the negro, who said they wanted to go\r\nto the cove to get the things left there. There could be no objection to\r\nthat, if they did not stay longer than was necessary to embark the\r\nproperty, and I so told them. Moreover, they would need a supply of\r\nwater. If they set about it at once they could do all this and be away\r\nby midnight, as there would be a moon to light them on the way.\r\n\r\nHaving settled this to our mutual satisfaction, I cut loose the yawl\r\nthat it might drift in, and directed them to come on and get their\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nThe alacrity with which the whole party tumbled into the yawl was\r\nsufficient evidence of the desperate straits they had fancied themselves\r\nto be in, at the prospect of being marooned on the island. Before they\r\ngot under way, I told the negro that if they chose to do so they might\r\ndelay departure until the next day, which would give them more time to\r\nmake proper preparation for their voyage; but that they must be under\r\nway before the next night. He agreed to this and said,--\r\n\r\n“Boss, we got nothen agin you. You’ve treated us square, and we’s mighty\r\nglad to get away.”\r\n\r\nThe Chinaman grinned at me as they bore away, as though he felt grateful\r\nfor not being shot, and had forgiven the blow below the belt. The\r\nIndians sat stolidly silent, but I felt surer of them than of either of\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had sailed we brought the boats to the shore, in the\r\nsheltered nook I have before mentioned, and unloaded the\r\npumping-apparatus before nightfall, to be ready to set it up in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThat night we slept on board the boat, but kept a watch all night. I\r\nturned in immediately after sundown and slept until one o’clock. Then\r\nMr. Millward wakened me and I kept watch until five o’clock, after which\r\nAlice watched for the two hours we both continued to sleep. There were\r\nno signs of the other party during the night. And I may state here, to\r\navoid repetition, that they put off in their boat about three o’clock in\r\nthe afternoon of that day, and before sunset were out of sight in the\r\nwestern board.\r\n\r\nIt took us all that day to set up the pumping-machine and get it into\r\nworking order, in addition to the slight task of setting up a sail on\r\nthe sand for a tent in which to sleep.\r\n\r\nWe had suffered so many set-backs now in regard to the galleon that we\r\nall felt like crowding the work to our utmost, for fear something new\r\nmight turn up. I could not help feeling that the pearl-fishing gang, as\r\nsoon as they could reach port and procure firearms, might take it into\r\ntheir heads to return for the spoils that they must expect would be\r\nfound in the wreck. We could not hope, therefore, to feel entirely\r\nsecure for longer than ten days.\r\n\r\nWhen the pearl-fishers sailed we observed them with the glass and noted\r\nthat the whole party was on board; therefore we should not need to keep\r\na watch for the present. That night, tired out, I slept soundly, but was\r\ntroubled with dreams about the galleon. For example, I dreamed that we\r\nhad emptied her hold completely and found nothing in it but a sealed\r\njar, which upon opening we found to contain a dirty visiting-card, on\r\nwhich was written, “I raised this galleon in 1830 and took out all her\r\ncontents. This is for the benefit of the next man who tries it. Please\r\nlet her sink again.”\r\n\r\nThis, absurd as it was, when added to the real uncertainty and natural\r\nanxiety I felt contributed not a little to my discomfort. I could not\r\nhelp anticipating a possible disappointment. But then reason told me\r\nplainly that the probabilities were all the other way. Still, there was\r\nthe ever recurring thought, “What if there should prove to be no\r\ntreasure?”\r\n\r\nThe next day Mr. Millward and I began the pumping business in earnest.\r\nOf course I was able to keep much longer at it than he, and his share\r\namounted to little more than to spell me occasionally for a short time.\r\nSince that leg-aching and back-breaking experience, kept up for four\r\ndays, I never can see a horse in a treadmill without a gush of sympathy.\r\nOn the fourth day the water was so low that the shark was almost\r\naground, and I put two loads of buckshot into the living grave of\r\nCaptain Senlis, whereupon it succumbed, and left the galleon unguarded.\r\n\r\nBy night of this fourth day the basin was pumped out sufficiently, and\r\nthe galleon lay almost completely exposed, the water inside of her still\r\nleaking out slowly. Completely exhausted we went to bed early and left\r\nher to drain as she might. Human nature could endure no more. I was so\r\nexhausted that I went supperless to bed, and consequently woke early in\r\nthe morning hungry as a hunter. While the others still slept I raked the\r\nembers together, built up the fire and put the coffee on to boil. I then\r\nroused my companions, and we were soon at breakfast discussing the\r\nprobabilities of finding anything in the old hulk. At last the day had\r\ncome around for which we had toiled and waited so long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTREASURE TROVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to convey to another an adequate idea of the\r\nfeelings I experienced when I clambered for the first time upon the deck\r\nof the old galleon. Alice and her father stood on the rocks as I\r\nadvanced along the shell-incrusted structure, axe in hand, to the raised\r\ncabin or poop. I struck the cemented door with the axe several blows,\r\nuntil it broke and fell in with a crash. Then there came up a damp\r\nsea-smell from a dark, cavernous interior, into which here and there\r\npenetrated a narrow beam of light from small crevices and openings\r\nabove. I was about to break in the window containing the iridescent pane\r\nof milky glass, when Alice called to me to spare it, if possible, for\r\nits exceeding beauty. So I dashed my axe through all the other incrusted\r\nopenings, and let in a flood of light and fresh air to the long sunken\r\napartment. Mr. Millward cautioned me to beware of foul air and gases;\r\nbut the caution was needless, the air was pure and sweet and impregnated\r\nonly with an odor such as a receding tide leaves behind. Testing it\r\ncautiously at first, I soon felt that it was safe, and entered the\r\ncabin, the floor of which was flush with the deck on which I stood.\r\n\r\nOn either hand were berths, the doors of some of which were closed, and\r\nsome fallen open. Within the berths I found the usual bunks, and looked\r\nwith dread for ghastly memorials of those who once occupied them. But if\r\nthere had been skeletons there at one time, the bones were long since\r\ndissolved and gone; not a trace was left. All about were remains of sea\r\norganisms of various kinds, animal and vegetable, which had lived and\r\nflourished here in the dark deep under the sea. I could note here and\r\nthere heaps indicating the decayed or covered remains of the furniture.\r\nA glass decanter and several goblets stood encrusted and cemented to\r\nwhat had once been a table. It was a strange sight, never to be\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nWith the axe I went about and stove in one after another all the doors,\r\nexcept one which resisted my efforts. This door was made stronger than\r\nthe others, and was banded and barred with iron much rusted, and in\r\nplaces so oxidized as to be mere streaks and stains of rust. I inferred\r\nthat here was the strong-room of the ship, and doubtless within its\r\nprecincts would be found whatever of treasure the galleon contained. I\r\nreserved the opening of this apartment, which was located at the port\r\nside of the rudder, until my companions should be present to share with\r\nme the pleasure or disappointment that might result from a disclosure of\r\nits contents. Having done this much I returned on deck and announced the\r\nresult of my investigations, and that I wanted all to be present at the\r\nopening of the treasure chamber.\r\n\r\nThe old man waded to the vessel as I had done, and I took Alice in my\r\narms and carried her, helping her up to a footing on the deck. Duke, not\r\nto be left behind, came plunging in and swam to the side, following his\r\nmistress, and I helped him also on board. Then we all entered the cabin,\r\nand I began at the door with the axe. At the second blow the blade went\r\nthrough near the bottom of the door, and out gushed a stream of water\r\nwhich poured down the slanting cabin-floor, draining away into one of\r\nthe berths. I enlarged this opening until the confined water flowed more\r\nfreely, and then we waited until it had drained out and ceased to flow.\r\nI wished very much for the crowbar that I had seen in the hands of our\r\ndeparted neighbors, but it had gone with them, and so I was fain to\r\ncontinue the work with the axe. Little by little the barrier was\r\ncompletely demolished and the chamber lay open before us.\r\n\r\nThere upon the floor was a great heap of something half filling the\r\nroom. With the axe I struck into it, and there shone out the yellow\r\nlustre of gold. Mingled with a black, oxidized mass of silver, all glued\r\ntogether, were great bars or bricks of the pure, indestructible,\r\nuntarnishable, precious metal, unchanged by all the time it had lain\r\nsunken beneath the waters. It shone with the same dull yellow that it\r\nhad given back to the light so long ago. Iron might rust, the bolts and\r\nbars might dissolve and fall away; the inferior silver might blacken,\r\nsoften, and change; but the noble gold was proof against time, and\r\nagainst the insidious tooth of the bromides, the chlorides, and iodides,\r\nand all the other salts that the sea held in solution in its mighty\r\nwaters. A simultaneous cry of delight from all went up at the sight. I\r\nclasped my darling close in my arms and kissed her sweet lips.\r\n\r\n“See,” cried I, “the gold! That means a home for us, my queen! It means\r\nthe redemption of the hills and valleys, the woodland and fields where I\r\nwas born, and where you shall rule, sweetheart!”\r\n\r\n“It means very much to us, my son,” said the old man; “it is at once\r\nyour fortune and my daughter’s dowry. Think of the good that can be done\r\nin the world by a proper use of this treasure which will be entrusted to\r\nyour care and stewardship.”\r\n\r\nDuke came up and sniffed suspiciously at the pile, and turned away as\r\nthough disgusted at the whole business, and the exceeding bad taste of\r\nhis friends. While I had been chopping at the door the dog was in the\r\ngreatest state of excitement, expecting no doubt that some sort of game\r\nwould be unearthed. But as it proved, nothing came forth, not even a\r\nchipmunk, and not even the stale scent of one. We all happened to be\r\nlooking at this display of canine wisdom, which was so significant and\r\nso complete a commentary on the artificial character of the value\r\npertaining to what we had found, that the effect was irresistible. We\r\nall burst into merry laughter, peal on peal, till the cabin of the old\r\ncraft rang with such a burst of hilarity, echoing through its cavernous\r\nrecesses, as it had not heard for centuries if ever before.\r\n\r\nNow that the gold was found I was in a state of feverish anxiety to get\r\nit out of the galleon. It seemed as though misfortune hung over us in\r\nthe cloudless sky. I could not hasten fast enough. The minutes seemed\r\nhours. A great dread was upon me. I could not have slept while the\r\ntreasure remained where it lay. To my excited brain and wrought-up\r\nimagination it seemed that the very ghosts of those who once owned the\r\ngold would come to claim it. Though it would be days before the\r\npearl-fishers could get back, I could not avoid casting anxious glances\r\ntoward the western horizon. Mr. Millward appeared to partake in some\r\ndegree of this same anxious condition of mind. I am certain no two men\r\never worked more freely up to the extent of their physical abilities\r\nthan we did that day. We loosened up and carried to Mr. Millward’s boat\r\nthe whole of the precious metal, more than a ton in weight including the\r\ngold and silver together, and stowed it on a layer of canvas where it\r\nmight serve as ballast, clearing out the ballast that was already there,\r\nand covered it over with the sail cloth of the tent, and over that a\r\nlayer of sand to conceal it all.\r\n\r\nThat night we slept on board the boat, and we began to feel the anxious\r\ncare of the charge that wealth brings. I got little sleep, and was\r\nrestless, and up and down all night. In the morning we began and\r\ncontinued until late in the afternoon a systematic examination of the\r\nentire interior of the galleon, searching for more treasure, but we\r\nfound nothing, and brought nothing more away from the wreck except the\r\npane of glass, and the decanter and goblets which I, for souvenirs,\r\nremoved at Alice’s request.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing more to keep us on the island; the weather was fair\r\nand settled, the wind was favorable, and we might have started that\r\nnight, but Mr. Millward thought it would be wise to provision the boat\r\nbetter and renew our water. Moreover, Alice expressed a wish to visit\r\nonce more our house that we might bid farewell to scenes which we might\r\nnever revisit. We therefore sailed for Home Creek in the sloop, leaving\r\nmy boat behind me as we should have no further occasion for it. We\r\nreached the creek an hour before sunset, and moored the boat in her old\r\nsnug place. Nothing at the house had been disturbed. By the level rays\r\nof the sun as he was about to sink behind the central plateau of the\r\nisland I lit a fire, and soon we had one started in the oven as well.\r\nThen began the roasting, baking, and boiling, of pork and beans, bread,\r\nyams, potatoes, coffee, and whatever we had in store. It was midnight\r\nbefore we completed our task and went to bed.\r\n\r\nAlice and her father slept at the house, and I made my bed in the boat,\r\nthe gun by my side, and Duke curled up at my head.\r\n\r\nThe last day on the island dawned clear and bright; the blue sky\r\nunflecked by a single cloud hung high above; the favorable wind that we\r\nhad sighed for in vain at times was gently rustling through the foliage\r\nand swaying the graceful palms; the myriad voices of Nature sounded all\r\nabout in the song of bird and hum of insect and boom of surf. When I\r\nrose to greet the day I saw Alice standing on the porch in the full\r\nsunlight, looking out at the sea all glistening as it was with light\r\nfrom a million facets. Presently Mr. Millward came out, his white head\r\nbare and his commanding figure erect and unbowed by years. They stood\r\ntogether thus when I came up and joined the group.\r\n\r\nThere was little to do before we left. Our breakfast, for which we did\r\nnot light a fire, was soon over. Then we loaded on our provisions,\r\nemptied and re-filled our water-gourds for the voyage, stored them, and\r\nwere ready to go. I dug up my pearls from their place of concealment.\r\nAlice went into the house and brought out my nautilus-shell from the\r\nmantel. We would leave all else as it was for the benefit possibly of\r\nsome shipwrecked successor, and carry away only what we needed for our\r\nuse upon the voyage.\r\n\r\nThen together we three, followed by the faithful Duke, made a round of\r\nvisits to the various familiar places,--the salt-pan, incrusted now with\r\nwhite salt; the shed, beneath whose shade we had toiled so hard and\r\npassed so many pleasant hours; the house, the oven, the garden, now\r\nluxuriant in its rich abundance of growth; the cocoanut grove,--and to\r\nall bade a silent farewell. At the last, with tears in her sweet eyes,\r\nAlice begged that I would walk with her down the beach and sit upon the\r\nrock by the seaside as we had done once before in a time that now seemed\r\nso long ago. When we reached the rock she put her arms about my neck and\r\nsaid, “It was here I first knew I loved you, dear. I could not go away\r\nwithout coming here with you to say good-by to the dear old island.”\r\n\r\nAh! fair Key Seven, good-by, good-by. How much of happiness do I owe\r\nyour friendly shores. Shine forth a gem of the sea. Smile ever in my\r\nremembrance as on that fair morning when, clad in all your loveliness,\r\nmy bride and I bade farewell to your palms and sands and groves and\r\nstreams, and listened for the last time to the chorus of your birds.\r\nFarewell, farewell. May we hope some day to come and visit these scenes\r\nagain, and open once more the gates of this earthly paradise before we\r\npass through the valley that leads us to the final home.\r\n\r\nIt was ten o’clock in the morning when we embarked and set sail from Key\r\nSeven bound for Martinique, a fair wind wafting us over the sea, the\r\ntinkling water at the bow and the broad wake behind speaking well for\r\nthe good speed we made. By two o’clock the island hung a trembling,\r\nhazy, blue cloud in the west. We looked at it with regret filled with\r\nsweet remembrance, as it sunk lower and lower and finally, fading away\r\nout of sight, was gone from our view.\r\n\r\nThe run to Martinique was wholly uneventful, though it took us four days\r\nto reach port, owing to the light winds. Throughout the voyage Mr.\r\nMillward and I took turns at the helm, steering by the compass. Not a\r\nsingle sail was sighted, and we drew into the old pier just four hours\r\nbefore the steamer bound for New York made the port and tied up to the\r\nsame pier.\r\n\r\nMr. Millward went at once to the captain of the newly arrived vessel and\r\nrelated enough of our story to apprise him of the nature of our cargo,\r\nand the desire we had to get to New York with it as soon as possible.\r\nThe captain, a New Bedford man, came back with Mr. Millward to the boat,\r\nand we then arranged for our passage and the safe carriage of our\r\ntreasure. The latter was stowed in canvas bags and sealed and weighed\r\nunder our supervision, and carried on board the steamer. Then my heart\r\ngrew lighter as the care of the treasure was lifted from my mind. We\r\nsecured ample insurance from the local underwriter, made arrangements\r\nthat the sloop should be sold and the proceeds sent to some of Mr.\r\nMillward’s old parishioners in Jamaica, and then, just as the sun was\r\nsetting, embarked for New York and home.\r\n\r\nMy story is done, for all our trials and labors and troubles were then\r\nover. Now we may ring the curtain down. But before it descends I may\r\ninvite you to look at the last tableau.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is a summer’s day. The dust lies thick on the shady road. The katydid\r\nrasps its musical wing in the tall elms which shade an old farmhouse. On\r\nthe porch, enjoying the faint breath of the evening air that comes\r\ngently over the fields of yellow grain, and through the orchard where\r\nthe home-returning cows have stopped a moment, is a group consisting of\r\na white-haired old man, who smokes his pipe in quiet comfort, a young\r\nman, and a beautiful young woman, at whose feet lies a noble Gordon\r\nsetter. It is the party whose story you have followed. This farmhouse\r\nand these broad acres have been redeemed with long sunken Spanish gold.\r\nIt is a loving and a happy party, whose hearts beat kindly for each\r\nother and for all.\r\n\r\nThe old man speaks:--\r\n\r\n“My children, to-day is the anniversary of our departure from Key Seven.\r\nLet us thank God for all the good gifts that have come to us from THE\r\nSPANISH GALLEON.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE END.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                        THE BRIDGE OF THE GODS.\r\n\r\n                     _A ROMANCE OF INDIAN OREGON._\r\n\r\n                            By F. H. BALCH.\r\n\r\n                    12mo, 280 pages. Price, $1.25.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a masterly and original delineation of Indian life. It is a\r\nstrong story, charged with the elemental forces of the human heart. The\r\nauthor portrays with unusual power the intense, stern piety of the\r\nministers of colonial New England, and the strange mingling of dignity,\r\nsuperstition, ferocity, and stoicism that characterized the early Indian\r\nwarriors.\r\n\r\nThere is no need of romancing, and Mr. Balch’s scenic descriptions are\r\nfor all practical purposes real descriptions. The legends he relates of\r\nthe great bridge which once spanned the Columbia, for which there is\r\nsome substantial history, adds to the mystical charms of the story. His\r\nIndian characters are as real as if photographed from life. No writer\r\nhas presented a finer character than the great chief of the Willamettes,\r\nMultnomah; Snoqualmie the Cayuse; or Tohomish the Seer. The night visit\r\nof Multnomah to the tomb of his dead wife upon that lonely island in the\r\nWillamette is a picture that will forever live in the reader’s\r\nmemory.... To those who have traversed the ground, and know something of\r\nIndian character and the wild, free life of pioneer days, the story will\r\nbe charming.--_Inter-Ocean, Chicago._\r\n\r\nIt is a truthful and realistic picture of the powerful Indian tribes\r\nthat inhabited the Oregon country two centuries ago.... It is a book\r\nthat will be of value as a historical authority; and as a story of\r\ninterest and charm, there are few novels that can rival it.--_Traveller,\r\nBoston._\r\n\r\nThere is much and deep insight in this book. The characters stand in\r\nclear outline, and are original. The movement of the story is quick and\r\nvaried, like the running water of the great river.--_The Pacific, San\r\nFrancisco._\r\n\r\nIts field is new for fiction; it is obviously the work of one who has\r\nbestowed a great deal of study on the subjects he would illustrate.

Price, $1.25.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe uncommonly favorable reception of Mrs. Abbott’s brilliant novelette,\r\n“Alexia,” by the public bespeaks in advance a lively interest in her new\r\nnovel, “The Beverleys.” It is a more extended and ambitious work than\r\nthe former, but has the same grace of style and liveliness of treatment,\r\ntogether with a much more considerable plot and more subtle delineations\r\nof character and life. The action of the story takes place in India, and\r\nreveals on the part of the authoress the most intimate knowledge of the\r\nofficial life of the large and aristocratic English colony in Calcutta.\r\nThe local coloring is strong and unusual.\r\n\r\nA more joyous story cannot be imagined.... A harum-scarum good-nature; a\r\nfrank pursuit of cakes and ale; a heedless, happy-go-lucky spirit, are\r\nadmirable components in a novel, however trying they may be found in the\r\nwalks of daily life. Such are the pleasures of “The Beverleys.” To read\r\nit is recreation, indeed.--_Public Ledger, Philadelphia._\r\n\r\nThe author writes throughout with good taste, and with a quick eye for\r\nthe picturesque.--_Herald, New York._\r\n\r\nIt is a pretty story, charmingly written, with cleverly sketched\r\npictures of various types of character.... The book abounds in keen,\r\nincisive philosophy, wrapped up in characteristic remarks.--_Times,\r\nChicago._\r\n\r\nAn absorbing story. It is brilliantly and vivaciously\r\nwritten.--_Literary World, Boston._\r\n\r\nThe author has until now been known, so far as we are aware, only by her\r\nformer story, “Alexia.” Unless signs fail which seldom _do_ fail, these\r\ntwo with which her name is now associated are simply the forerunners of\r\nworks in a like vein of which American literature will have reason to be\r\nproud.--_Standard, Chicago._\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Sold by all booksellers, or mailed, on receipt of price, by_\r\n                   A.

Price, $1.25.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same material drawn upon by Longfellow for his “New England\r\nTragedies” is here used with greater fulness and with no less historical\r\nexactitude. The story has for its background the dark and gloomy\r\npictures of the witchcraft persecution, of which it furnishes a\r\nthrilling view. It is remarkable for bold imagination, wonderfully rapid\r\naction, and continued and absorbing interest.\r\n\r\nIn short, it is too good a piece of fiction to be accepted as truth,\r\nwhich is to the credit of the author’s imaginative powers; for “Martha\r\nCorey” is an absorbing tale.--_Public Ledger, Philadelphia._\r\n\r\nThe story is curious and quaint, differing totally from the novels of\r\nthis day; and the pictures of life among the early inhabitants of\r\nMassachusetts show that the author has been an untiring and faithful\r\nstudent for her work.--_Weekly Item, Philadelphia._\r\n\r\nThe characters are well delineated; the language is smooth and refined;\r\nand from frequent change of scene and character the book is rendered\r\nvery entertaining.

DR. F. W. GUNSAULUS.\r\n\r\n               Two Vols. 12mo, 707 pages. Price, $2.50.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis work is one that challenges attention for its ambitious character\r\nand its high aim. It is an historical novel,--or, rather, as the author\r\nprefers to call it, “An Historical Study in Fiction.” It is the result\r\nof long and careful study of the period of which it treats, and hence is\r\nthe product of genuine sympathies and a freshly-fired imagination. The\r\nfield is Europe, and the period is the beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncentury,--a time when the fading glow of the later Renaissance is giving\r\nplace to the brighter glories of the dawning Reformation.\r\n\r\nThe book deals, in a broad sense, with the grand theme of the progress\r\nof intellectual liberty. Many of its characters are well-known\r\nhistorical personages,--such as Erasmus, Sir Thomas More, Cardinal\r\nWolsey, Henry VIII. of England, Francis I. of France, the disturbing\r\nmonk Martin Luther, and the magnificent Pope Leo X.; other characters\r\nare of course fictitious, introduced to give proper play to the author’s\r\nfancy and to form a suitable framework for the story.\r\n\r\nInterwoven with the more solid fabric are gleaming threads of romance;\r\nand bright bits of description and glows of sentiment relieve the more\r\nsombre coloring. The memorable meeting of the French and English\r\nmonarchs on the Field of the Cloth of Gold, with its gorgeous pageantry\r\nof knights and steeds and silken banners, and all the glitter and charm\r\nof chivalry, furnish material for several chapters, in which the\r\nauthor’s descriptive powers are put to the severest test; while the\r\nWaldensian heroes in their mountain homes, resisting the persecutions of\r\ntheir religious foes, afford some thrilling and dramatic situations.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Sold by all booksellers, or mailed, on receipt of price, by_\r\n                   A.

Price, $1.25.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The Story of Tonty” is eminently a Western story, beginning at\r\nMontreal, tarrying at Fort Frontenac, and ending at the old fort at\r\nStarved Rock, on the Illinois River. It weaves the adventures of the two\r\ngreat explorers, the intrepid La Salle and his faithful lieutenant,\r\nTonty, into a tale as thrilling and romantic as the descriptive portions\r\nare brilliant and vivid. It is superbly illustrated with twenty-three\r\nmasterly drawings by Mr. Enoch Ward.\r\n\r\n     Such tales as this render service past expression to the cause of\r\n     history. They weave a spell in which old chronicles are vivified\r\n     and breathe out human life. Mrs. Catherwood, in thus bringing out\r\n     from the treasure-houses of half-forgotten historical record things\r\n     new and old, has set herself one of the worthiest literary tasks of\r\n     her generation, and is showing herself finely adequate to its\r\n     fulfilment.--_Transcript, Boston._\r\n\r\n     A powerful story by a writer newly sprung to fame.... All the\r\n     century we have been waiting for the deft hand that could put flesh\r\n     upon the dry bones of our early heroes. Here is a recreation\r\n     indeed.... One comes from the reading of the romance with a\r\n     quickened interest in our early national history, and a profound\r\n     admiration for the art that can so transport us to the dreamful\r\n     realms where fancy is monarch of fact.--_Press, Philadelphia._\r\n\r\n     “The Story of Tonty” is full of the atmosphere of its time. It\r\n     betrays an intimate and sympathetic knowledge of the great age of\r\n     explorers, and it is altogether a charming piece of\r\n     work.--_Christian Union, New York._\r\n\r\n     Original in treatment, in subject, and in all the details of mise\r\n     en scene, it must stand unique among recent romances.--_News,\r\n     Chicago._\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Sold by all booksellers, or mailed, on receipt of price, by_\r\n                   A.
