This Journal has had a continuous\r\nexistence and has been an important medium in advancing the knowledge\r\nof the natural history of the state. A number of years ago the\r\nNATURALIST became the official organ of the Ohio Academy of Science\r\nand was thus sent to every member of the Academy. At that time the\r\nOhio Academy was largely composed of Biologists and Geologists, but\r\nhas now widened its scope to include Physicists, Mathematicians, and\r\nothers. It was, therefore, thought desirable by many that the scope of\r\nthe NATURALIST should be enlarged so as to make it representative of\r\nall of the activities of the Academy. In accordance with this desire,\r\ncommittees were appointed by the various departments interested and a\r\nplan for future publication was proposed which was finally adopted.\r\n\r\nThe Ohio State University Scientific Society was thus organized at\r\nthe Ohio State University and will take over the control of the new\r\npublication. This Society is to have somewhat the same relationship\r\nto THE OHIO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE as the Biological Club had to the Ohio\r\nNaturalist. The management of the Journal is under an Editorial Board\r\nmade up of representatives of various scientific departments of the\r\nUniversity. This Board elects annually the Editor and two Associate\r\nEditors.\r\n\r\n                       EDITORIAL BOARD.\r\n\r\nAgricultural Chemistry, J. F. Lyman; Agricultural Engineering, F.

It is hoped that with the wider field covered,\r\nit may interest a much larger number of the scientific people of the\r\nstate, and be financially supported so that it may soon develop into a\r\njournal of high standard. It is the intention of the present Editors,\r\nwith the large field before them, to publish results of research as\r\nwell as articles of general interest in the advancement of Science.\r\nOn the natural history side the aim at present will be to pay more\r\nespecial attention to the biology, geology and geography of Ohio, but\r\narticles dealing with any other region will be acceptable.\r\n\r\n  The Editors for the present year are as follows:\r\n      John H.

SCHAFFNER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAKING OF A PHOTOGRAPHIC OBJECTIVE.\r\n\r\nBeing a Description of a Course in Applied Optics Offered at\r\nthe Emerson McMillin Observatory of the Ohio State University.\r\n\r\n\r\nH. C. LORD.\r\n\r\nPhotography, in its more serious phase, has taken an important place\r\nin almost every field of human activity while in its lighter mood,\r\nthrough the development of the “Kodak” and the roll film, is giving us\r\none of our most delightful pastimes. As a condition for the best work,\r\na high grade lens is a necessity and especially so for those extremely\r\nshort exposures required in the photography of rapidly moving objects.\r\nIt often happens that some of the most perfect and at the same time\r\nmost difficult specimens of optical design are found on cameras so\r\nsmall that they can be easily carried in one’s coat pocket. These so\r\ncalled anastigmats furnish to the optician a difficult and yet at the\r\nsame time most fascinating problem for mathematical investigation.\r\nThousands of photographic objectives are placed on the market every\r\nyear, yet though almost every branch of engineering is covered by\r\nour technical schools, I know of no place outside of Germany where a\r\nstudent can be instructed in the design and construction of a simple\r\nphotographic objective. Professor Silvanus P. Thompson in his inaugural\r\naddress as President of the British Optical Convention held in London\r\nin 1912, states: “In the Universities and Colleges the only people who\r\nare learning Optics are merely taking it as a part of Physics for the\r\nsake of passing an examination for a degree, and care nothing for the\r\napplication of Optics in the industries. They are being taught Optics\r\nby men who are not opticians, who never ground a lens or calculated\r\neven an achromatic doublet, who never worked an opthalmoscope or\r\nmeasured a cylindrical lens.” Further on he speaks as follows: “What\r\nis wanted is an establishment where the whole atmosphere is one of\r\noptical interest; where theory and practice go hand in hand; where the\r\nmathematician will himself grind lenses and measure their performance\r\non the test bench; where braincraft will be married to handcraft;\r\nwhere precision, whether in computation or workmanship, will be the\r\ndominating ambition.”\r\n\r\nSome four years before the above quotations were written, the author\r\nstarted to work up a course in Optics which should aim, not only to\r\ngive to the student a knowledge of the fundamental theory of lenses,\r\nbut should also apply those principles to the methods of optical design\r\nand thus enable him to compute the curves of the component lenses of a\r\nphotographic objective. This has now been fairly well worked out and is\r\ngiven in the Arts college under the official titles “Astronomy, 107,\r\n108, 109 and 110.” The basis of this course is “A System of Applied\r\nOptics,” by H. Dennis Taylor, the inventor of the Cooke lens. This\r\nsplendid volume develops, from the standpoint of geometric optics, a\r\ncomplete discussion of the formation of an image by a combination of\r\nany number of lenses, but does not apply the methods and formulae there\r\ndeveloped to the actual design of a photographic objective. The writer\r\nof this paper was, therefore, compelled to work out this part of the\r\ntheory for himself and, as he had always felt that all mathematics\r\nshould ultimately end in arithmetic and that all arithmetic should\r\nultimately end in doing something, he resolved at the outset that\r\nthe course should end in laboratory work in the actual computation,\r\ngrinding and polishing of lenses. As to how well this has succeeded,\r\nI will let the illustrations which accompany this article speak for\r\nthemselves. Suffice it to say that the half tone cuts were made from\r\nfive by seven enlargements from negatives, one and three quarters by\r\ntwo and one-eighth inches, taken with a lens _designed_ and _built_\r\nat this observatory and working at an aperture of F six. A peculiar\r\nfeature of this lens is that it is composed of four lenses all cut\r\nfrom the same piece of crown glass. This lens beautifully illustrates\r\nthe importance of adding to the theoretical side of the course, the\r\npractical work in the laboratory in construction and testing as this\r\nlens, though in the main satisfactory, has one serious defect and a\r\ndefect which is very instructive in that it shows that at a certain\r\npoint in the design, the theory was weak and needed to be extended and\r\nenlarged. It should be stated that this theoretical investigation is\r\nnow completed and ready to be put to the test of practice.\r\n\r\nThis Observatory possesses a well equipped instrument shop, which was\r\nused for the practical side of this work and it has seemed to me that\r\na description of how we used the ordinary tools of a machine shop, of\r\nwhat special appliances we were compelled to make, and how we finally\r\nground and polished our lenses would be of general interest. These\r\nmethods do not pretend to be the best, nor those actually employed by\r\nthe manufacturer, but they do illustrate how a lens can be made and how\r\na little ingenuity will enable one if he has the standard tools of a\r\nmachine shop to carry out almost any kind of experimental work.\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary to this, a brief outline of the problem before the\r\nlens designer may be of interest. A simple lens consists of a piece of\r\nglass bounded by either plane or spherical surfaces as these, except\r\nin large reflecting surfaces, are the only kind that can be made with\r\nsufficient accuracy. Such a lens would have a great many defects or\r\nerrors and would be unable to give a sharp image on the photographic\r\nplate unless stopped down to a very small aperture. By changing the\r\nradii of the surfaces, and the thickness of the lens, the designer can\r\nvary these errors, but after all is said and done he can do but little\r\nto improve the single lens. He then combines lenses of different forms\r\nand of different kinds of glass into a single objective, in this way\r\nmaking the positive errors of some of the lenses balance the negative\r\nerrors of the others, until he arrives at a combination which is more\r\nor less perfect according to his skill as a designer. How this is\r\naccomplished is far beyond the limits of this paper, so I will now\r\nproceed to the mechanical side of the problem.\r\n\r\nThe first consideration is the glass; of course it must be what is\r\nknown as optical glass and its selection is really part of the work of\r\nthe designer. Optical glass is nothing more than a very perfect kind\r\nof glass which has been exquisitely annealed. You are all familiar\r\nwith the intense green of window glass when seen edgewise; a piece of\r\nwhite paper will hardly be changed in color when seen through twelve\r\ninches of a good optical crown. The best optical glass is not made in\r\nthis country, but must be purchased from either Schott & Gen. of Jena\r\nor Mantois of France. The Jena glass has become very celebrated and\r\nmost of the lens makers state that their lenses are made out of it and\r\nas a consequence most people think that Jena glass means a certain\r\nkind, while, as a matter of fact, their catalogue for 1909 shows about\r\nseventy different varieties. These differ in optical qualities and\r\nchemical composition, and cost from about a dollar to five dollars a\r\npound, with a few special varieties costing as much as fifteen dollars.\r\nThis glass comes in slabs, but will be cut by the makers with either a\r\ndiamond saw or a sand saw, the purchaser paying for the “saw dust.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2]\r\n\r\nThe slabs that were used here were 2\" × 6\" × ½\" and the first operation\r\nwas to cut from these round disks a little larger than the finished\r\nlens. This was accomplished in the following manner and is illustrated\r\nin Fig. 1. In the chuck of a drill speeder on a Barnes drill press was\r\nplaced a ¼\" steel rod which carried at its lower end a copper tube,\r\nA, which was steadied at the bottom by a steel washer, bored to a\r\nloose fit to the tube, and clamped to the glass as shown. Number 40\r\nCarborundum was used and lubricated with _plenty of water_. The tube\r\nmust be lifted frequently to allow the abrasive to flow to the cutting\r\nedge. This is done so often that it seems almost a continuous motion of\r\nlifting and pressing down again, the tool resting on the glass hardly\r\nmore than two or three seconds at a time. The cutting may be done at\r\nsuch a speed as to allow of a slight heating. As soon as the tube has\r\ncut itself about a sixteenth of an inch into the glass, the guiding\r\nwasher may be removed and the glass will then act as its own guide. A\r\ndisk about one inch in diameter and a half of an inch thick could be\r\ncut out in a little over a half of an hour. At B Fig. 1 is shown one\r\nof the uncut slabs and at C and D two that are about used up. Though\r\nworking rather slowly this proved quite satisfactory though wasteful\r\nof glass as it cut a rather wide scarf, copper must be used; brass was\r\ntried but the wear was so great as to render it almost useless while\r\nthe copper shows almost none.\r\n\r\nAs these disks are cut out they are not only cone shaped but the edges\r\nare very rough so that the next operation was to grind these to smooth\r\nand true circular disks. This was done on a Wells tool grinder shown\r\nin Fig. 2, which was slowed way down by placing a large pulley on the\r\ncounter shaft. The glass to be ground was held by cementing it with\r\npitch onto a piece of brass rod which in turn was held in the drawing\r\ncollet of the head A. A special wheel B, made by the Norton people\r\nfor grinding the rims of spectacle lenses, was used and the machine\r\nslowed until the wheel would keep wet when running against a sponge,\r\nC, resting in water. The glass disk was in this way kept dripping and\r\nheating entirely prevented. The grinding was then carried out just as\r\nwith any other material and the edge was made beautifully smooth and\r\ntrue in a few minutes. The beauty of pitch as a cement for holding the\r\nglass is that a slight heating will soften it so that the disk can be\r\nshifted to any position and then a dash of cold water clamps it in\r\nplace and at the same time the pitch will slowly yield to the slightest\r\npressure so that in a few minutes the glass is entirely free from\r\nstrain. In manufacturing this sort of work is done with a diamond and\r\nis of course done much more quickly.\r\n\r\nThe disks were thick enough to make two lenses each so we sawed them\r\ninto two as illustrated in Fig. 3. A is an old polishing head upon\r\nwhich was mounted a pulley at one end and a copper disk, B, at the\r\nother, the disk being held between large washers. C is a cast iron box\r\nfastened to an arm, D, hinged at E and kept pressed against the copper\r\ndisk by a cord passing over two pulleys on the ceiling. This made a\r\nmost excellent automatic feed. The glass to be split was fastened to\r\na block of pine with pitch and the wood held in the iron box, C, with\r\nwedges. Number 40 Carborundum was used with plenty of water and the\r\nglass was cut through faster than a power hack saw would cut through\r\nsteel. The glass should be cut half way through and then reversed so\r\nthat the final break will come in the middle and thus prevent the edges\r\nfrom spawling off. The chief defect of this machine was the way it\r\nscattered emery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3]\r\n\r\nThe disks are now ready for the grinding which is done on the machine\r\non the right of Fig. 3, which consists simply of a vertical spindle\r\nrun by a quarter twist belt from the counter shaft against the wall.\r\nThe end of this spindle is tapered at the upper end to receive the\r\ngrinding tool or laps, shown on the table in Fig. 5 which also shows\r\nthe spindle raised so that the grinding lap is seen above the tin box,\r\nC, which surrounds the spindle to catch the abrasive that is thrown off\r\nin grinding. The glass is first smoothed down on a flat lap until it is\r\nof equal thickness at all points as measured by a micrometer when it is\r\nready to be ground to the proper curves. For this purpose the spherical\r\nlaps, shown in Fig. 5, are turned in the special machine illustrated in\r\nFig. 4. The compound rest of an old Seller’s lathe was removed and in\r\nits place, on the cross slide of the carriage, was mounted the sphere\r\nturning rest. This consists of a base, A, in which the slide, B, is\r\nso mounted that it can be rotated about the center, C, by turning the\r\nmilled head, D, which carries a worm at the opposite end. E is the\r\ntool post with the cutting tool T and L the lap to be turned. A hole\r\nwas drilled at C into which was fitted a round piece of steel the\r\nupper end being pointed and then half cut away like a center reamer.\r\nThis was used in finding the zero; the rod, pointed end up, was placed\r\nin the hole at C and the cutting tool adjusted against the flattened\r\nside. The zero position is then determined by measuring, with an inside\r\nmicrometer, the distance from the tool post to a stop placed at the\r\nend of the slide B. By adding to or subtracting from the zero reading\r\nof the micrometer the length of the radius of the grinding lap, the\r\ntool post may be set to the proper position for either a convex or a\r\nconcave surface. This, however, is only approximate, for these laps\r\nmust be made with the highest possible accuracy. After sufficient cuts\r\nhave been taken to give a spherical surface, the radius is carefully\r\nmeasured with a special spherometer and the error in the radius\r\ncorrected by changing the position of the cutting tool by an amount\r\ncalculated from the readings of the spherometer. This spherometer we\r\nwere compelled to build as we could find none of sufficient accuracy on\r\nthe market and it is described in a note at the end of this article.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 4, R is simply a steady rest made with the large overhang\r\nto allow the slide B to swing under it in turning a convex surface.\r\nTwo master laps, male and female, must be made and carefully ground\r\ntogether. Every effort should be taken to make these as accurate as\r\npossible since upon these depends the goodness of our lens. This\r\nspecial tool is easy to make and leaves nothing to be desired in its\r\noperation. Detail drawings and directions for making it are given in a\r\nnote at the end.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the grinding or lapping of the lenses themselves. This\r\nis done in a lap turned as above and carefully fitted to the master\r\nlaps and which must be trued from time to time as the work progresses.\r\nThis lapping of glass is entirely different from the lapping of metals\r\nin that, while in metals the lap is to be kept almost free from the\r\nabrasive, in glass the lap must be freely supplied with emery and water\r\nor deep scratches will result. The best way to apply the emery is with\r\na paint brush; the brush, saturated with emery, being held in front of\r\nthe lens as it is ground. The lens may be held in the hand or cemented\r\nto a disk of brass having a center hole drilled in the back in which is\r\nplaced a pointed piece of steel held in the hand, the lens being free\r\nto rotate about the pointed steel holder. Of course where the lens has\r\nto be ground to a definite thickness it must be held by hand. Flour of\r\nemery was used to rough grind though coarser grades would have worked\r\nfaster. The final smooth grinding was done with a special fine emery\r\nmade for this purpose by Bausch and Lomb. Great care must be taken in\r\nthe grinding to keep the lens as nearly centered as possible. A lens is\r\nsaid to be centered when the line which joins the centers of curvature\r\nof the surfaces passes through the center of figure. Obviously if a\r\ndouble convex lens could be ground to a knife edge it would be centered\r\nbut if this were done the edge would be almost certain to crumble\r\nin the final polishing and deep scratches result. The centering of\r\na convex lens can be watched by keeping the edge as nearly uniform\r\nof thickness as possible with a concave lens, if the original blank\r\nis made larger than necessary and care is taken to make the sides\r\nparallel, the centering can be watched by keeping a flat edge of _equal\r\nwidth_ around the concave portion, the lens being placed back on the\r\nflat tool, from time to time, as the work progresses. If care is used\r\nthe lens need be made but little larger than the finished size to allow\r\nfor the final accurate centering to be described later.\r\n\r\nAfter being smooth ground the lens is beautifully smooth and velvety\r\nto the touch but is just as much ground glass as ever, that is, it is\r\nabsolutely opaque. We now come to the polishing. This is done with\r\nspecially prepared rouge and only an excessively small amount of glass\r\nis taken off. Lord Rayleigh in a paper on “Polishing of Glass Surfaces”\r\nread before the British Optical Convention held in 1905, states: “I\r\nstarted with a finely ground surface, rather more finely ground I think\r\nthan is used in practice, and I found that in order to obtain a pretty\r\ngood polish it was necessary to remove a weight of glass, corresponding\r\nto a depth of about 6 wavelengths. I do not pretend that such a polish\r\nwould satisfy the requirements of commerce; probably the 6 would have\r\nto be raised to 10 or 12 in order to get to the bottom of the deepest\r\npits.” When it is remembered that a wave length is about the fifty\r\nthousandth part of an inch we realize how very delicate such lapping\r\nmust be. For this work the lap is covered with pitch which has been\r\nbrought to the proper degree of hardness either by boiling, to harden\r\nit or by adding asfalt varnish to soften it. The proper degree of\r\nhardness is very important and must be adjusted to the temperature of\r\nthe room. Obviously if the pitch is too soft it will not hold its shape\r\nand it will be impossible to hold the polishing tool to the proper\r\nradius. I have put three different curves on a lens about an inch in\r\ndiameter in a few minutes and it had to go back on the grinding machine\r\nbefore it could be finished.\r\n\r\nThe polishing tool is prepared as follows: A disk of pitch, about ¼\"\r\nthick, is cast by pouring it in a mold made by a strip of brass bent\r\nto a circle, the ends clamped with a tool maker’s clamp, and rested on\r\na piece of cold cast iron which has been planed smooth. This should be\r\nof such size that when bent to the proper shape it can be molded over\r\na tool similar to the grinding tool but with a radius changed by about\r\nthe thickness of the pitch. This tool is then heated and painted with\r\na stick of pitch, the disk is warmed, and the two pressed together,\r\nwhen cooled the pitch will stick tight to the iron but will be far from\r\na smooth surface. This and the master tool of the opposite curvature\r\nare placed in warm water and pressed together and at the same time one\r\nslowly rotated, one about the other. When a good fit is secured they\r\nare cooled and a number of small holes, about 1-8\" in diameter, are\r\ndrilled all over the pitch to distribute the abrasive, which of course\r\nspoils the surface and the tool must be again pressed. This pressing\r\nto shape must be done repeatedly and requires great care and some\r\npractice in order to have the pitch come to the exact opposite of the\r\npressing tool. The most important thing is to do the pressing slowly\r\nand in fact in the whole process of this work one must never get in a\r\nhurry. Ritchey, in his memoir on the construction of the great 60\" at\r\nMt. Wilson, recommends covering the pitch with beeswax, and for quicker\r\nand poorer work a cloth polisher may be used, the cloth being a special\r\nfelt and cemented to the cast iron tool with a thin layer of pitch.\r\n\r\nThe abrasive is rouge or red oxide of iron and its preparation is\r\nfully described in the above mentioned work by Ritchey. We purchased\r\nthe anhydrous red oxide of iron from Merck & Co. This was mixed with\r\nplenty of water in the jars shown at E, Fig. 5. The rouge will rapidly\r\nprecipitate, the coarse particles falling to the bottom, and leaving\r\nclear water above the precipitated rouge. The upper two-thirds of the\r\nrouge will be almost perfect and will give a beautiful polish when\r\ncarefully siphoned off. This should be kept in tightly corked bottles,\r\none of the best things is a horse radish jar as this has a place for\r\nthe handle of the brush in the glass stopper, and all dust and grit\r\ncan be easily washed off before the jar is opened. For polishing, the\r\nlens is cemented to a handle at whose end is a piece of brass turned to\r\nfit the lens in the sphere turning machine already described. Even in\r\na small lens the polishing tool must be run slowly, the speeds of our\r\nmachines run from 170 to 300 revolutions per minute and the fastest can\r\nseldom be used. The reason of this is that the lens fits the polisher\r\nso perfectly that almost a perfect vacuum is formed and the lens hugs\r\nthe polished so closely that it is impossible to hold it in small sizes\r\nby hand alone and in the case of a convex surface, if the cavity is\r\ncarried clear out to the edge of the glass disk, this may be broken\r\nsimply by the friction due to this grip of the glass and pitch. Fig. 5\r\nshows a horizontal polishing head at B and a vertical one at C. There\r\nis little choice except that for convex surfaces B seems the best, as\r\nit can be run faster, while for concave C seems better.\r\n\r\nThe lenses are now ready to be centered, that is, the circumference so\r\nturned that the line which joins the centers of curvature of the two\r\nspherical surfaces shall pass through the center of figure. In order\r\nto accomplish this, the lens is first cleaned from the pitch used to\r\ncement it to the handle used in holding the lens for polishing. For a\r\nlong time I could find no way of doing this satisfactorily when pitch\r\nwas the cement; finally, I laid my troubles before Dr. A. M. Bleile,\r\nHead of the Department of Physiology, and he suggested to first soak\r\nthe lens in lard and then wash it in benzol (C_{6}H_{6}). This worked\r\nlike magic though the first time I tried it I used some lard that had\r\nbeen heated with some pitch in it which made the lard very soft in fact\r\nalmost as soft as it could be and yet not be an oil, and this same lard\r\nwas used over and over again. The action is rather peculiar; the lard\r\ndoes not apparently effect the pitch at all but after a few minutes in\r\nthe benzene it all flakes off and leaves the lens perfectly clean. The\r\nactual centering is then carried out on the grinding machine shown in\r\nFig. 2; A holder, D, whose front face has been turned in the spherical\r\nturning machine to fit one of the surfaces of the lens, is held in the\r\nhead A. If the lens be cemented to this with a thin coat of pitch,\r\nit is obvious that the surface of the lens next to the holder will\r\nhave its center of curvature coincide with the axis of rotation of\r\nthe spindle of the head, A, but the center of curvature of the other\r\nlens surface will probably fall outside of this axis. A lamp, L, has\r\na tin chimney with a pin hole in it turned towards the lens, this\r\npin hole forming a brilliant point of light, an image of which is\r\nformed by each surface and reflected by the total reflecting prism,\r\nP, into the telescope, T, where it is seen through the eyepiece. If\r\nthe centers of curvature of both surfaces do not accurately coincide\r\nwith the axis of rotation of the head, A, the images of the pin hole\r\nwill describe circles as this axis is rotated. The back surface will\r\nof course be centered if the layer of the pitch used as cement is of\r\nuniform thickness which will generally be the case if the work has\r\nbeen carefully done; but in any case the image formed by it should\r\nbe examined. If the front surface is out of center, as it generally\r\nwill be, the holder should be warmed and the lens shifted, care being\r\nused to keep it tight against the surface of the holder as it is being\r\nshifted. As soon as both images remain stationary as the head, A, is\r\nrotated, the lens is fed against the wheel, B, and ground true and to\r\nsize. This worked beautifully and the tests were wonderfully sensitive.\r\nAs soon as the component lenses of the objective have all been thus\r\ncentered, they are ready to be assembled in the cell or shutter in\r\nwhich they are to be used; but as this is simply a matter of careful\r\nmachine work, I need not describe it further.\r\n\r\nI know of no literature on the grinding of small lenses though the\r\nfollowing memoirs on the making of large reflecting telescopes should\r\nbe in the hands of any one interested in this work:\r\n\r\n=On the Construction of a Five-foot Equatorial Reflecting Telescope.=\r\n      By A.

The advantage of this form of spherometer\r\nis that it is very easy to make the point of the micrometer exactly\r\ncentral with the base and the value of 2a can be accurately determined\r\nby means of an ordinary micrometer calliper. For a convex surface,\r\n2a should obviously be the inside diameter of the base, B.\r\n\r\nIn using the instrument, two tables, one for concave and one for\r\nconvex surfaces, should be prepared; these tables to give the power in\r\ndioptres for each one thousandth of an inch in the value of d. Using\r\nthe American Optical Co.’s Standard Index, namely, μ equal to 1.5000\r\nand one dioptre as being the power of a lens of 40 inches focus, we\r\nhave, for a plano lens, p = 4/f = 40d/(a^2 + d^2) since f = r/(μ-1).\r\n\r\nThe advantage of forming the table in dioptres in place of radii\r\ndirectly is that the tabular differences are small at all parts of the\r\ntable so that interpolation can be readily done and this is not the\r\ncase in tables which give the radii directly.\r\n\r\nIf upon measuring the radius of the tool or lap being turned in the\r\nsphere turning machine, Fig. 4, with this spherometer, the tool is\r\nfound to be in error by an amount Δp this may be corrected by changing\r\nthe position of the cutting tool by an amount 20 (Δp / p^2).\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 2—CROSS SECTION OF THE SPHERE TURNING REST.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 7 is shown a cross section of the sphere turning rest further\r\nillustrated in Fig. 4. In machining this the following suggestions\r\nshould be followed. The piece M should be cast with a lug projecting\r\nfrom the face PQ to chuck it by and all the turning done at one\r\nchucking. It should be made a close fit to R and bolted tight against\r\nDG and ED´ with the bolts S_{3} and S_{4}, clearance being given along\r\nthe line HF. To compensate for ware the face DG and ED´ can be releaved\r\nfrom time to time with a file. The base N, should be planed along AB,\r\nwhere it fastens to the cross slide of the carriage, then bolted to\r\na face plate of the lathe and finished, care being used to leave the\r\nsetting of the compound rest unchanged between machining the faces CD\r\nand C´D´ of the pieces M and N. The dove tail on R should be first\r\nplaned and then this bolted to a face plate and the boss GHFE and the\r\nfaces KG and EL turned at one setting. If these directions are followed\r\nalmost no hand work will be needed.

Tilden; the\r\nspecimens in the U. S. National Herbarium; and small collections sent\r\nme by Professor Farlow, Miss Tilden, Professor A. B. Klugh, Professor\r\nD. S. Johnson and Miss Grace Stone. They have been compared with the\r\nspecies distributed by Wittrock and Nordstedt in their “Algae Aquae\r\ndulcis exsiccatae,” and other valuable European and South American\r\nspecimens sent me by Professors O. Borge and O. Nordstedt.\r\n\r\nIn determining almost any species of the Zygnemales it is absolutely\r\nessential that the specimens show both the vegetative cells and the\r\nmature spores. With the exception of a few species of Mougeotia the\r\nspores are colored either yellow, brown, or blue when they are mature.\r\nThe characteristic markings of the median spore wall do not develop\r\nusually until this color appears. Consequently it is useless to attach\r\nnames to vegetative specimens based on dimensions and number of\r\nchromatophores. Keys based on such characters are not only useless, but\r\nmisleading.\r\n\r\nJudging from my experience in Illinois it is highly probable that the\r\nlist of North American forms will be considerably augmented, when\r\nintensive studies have been made at localities in the Southern United\r\nStates. The most satisfactory method of collecting these forms is to\r\ntake samples from the various ponds and streams at regular intervals\r\nof ten days, or two weeks, throughout the growing season. Many of the\r\nspecies show local variations and considerable experience is needed\r\nbefore many of the forms can be satisfactorily classified. The writer\r\nhas in course of preparation an illustrated key to the group, in which\r\nfigures for all of the species will be published.\r\n\r\n\r\n=DEBARYA= Wittrock.\r\n\r\nThis genus is in many respects the most generalized of all the\r\n_Zygnemales_. It is distinguished by three important characteristics:\r\n(1) the entire contents of the gametangia enter into the making of the\r\nzygospore; (2) the zygospore is formed in the conjugating tube and\r\nis not cut off from the other parts of the gametangia by partition\r\nwalls; (3) as the gametes move toward the tube during conjugation,\r\ntheir place is taken by a secretion of cellulose, which renders the\r\ngametangia solid and highly refractive. This secretion also occurs when\r\na vegetative cell forms an aplanospore.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Debarya glyptosperma= Wittrock.\r\n\r\nThis species has been recorded for America. It is not uncommon in\r\nMassachusetts and has also been found in Minnesota and Florida. In\r\nP. B.-A. No. 808 from Boswell, California is a somewhat smaller\r\nvariety with blue spores associated with _Zygnema peliosporum_ Wittr.\r\nThe spores are common in the material and the vegetative cells and\r\nfilaments occasional. Following is a diagnosis for this variety:\r\n\r\nVar. =formosa= nov. var. Cellulis vegetativis 7.5-9µ latis;\r\nzygosporis 24-30µ × 30-42µ, caeruleis; ceterum ut in typo.\r\n\r\nVegetative cells 7.5-9µ in diameter, zygospores 24-30µ × 30-42µ steel\r\nblue, otherwise like the type.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Debarya americana= nov. sp.\r\n\r\nCellulis vegetativis 9-12µ × 27-120µ, ad dissepimenta constrictis;\r\nchromatophoris cum pyrenoidibus 2; cellulis fructiferis,\r\n10-14µ × 75-180µ; zygosporis ovoideis vel quadrato-ovoideis,\r\n20-40µ × 30-40µ, angulis rotundatis, productis, vel retusis;\r\nparthenosporis 15-20µ × 20-30µ, oblique ellipticis, cum polis retusis;\r\nmesosporio subtiliter et irregulariter verrucoso, maturitate\r\nluteo-brunneo.\r\n\r\nVegetative cells 9-12µ × 27-120µ constricted at the end walls,\r\nchromatophore with two pyrenoids; fertile cells 10-14µ × 75-180µ;\r\nzygospores ovoid or quadrately ovoid, 20-40µ × 30-40µ, with angles\r\nrounded, produced, or retuse; parthenospores 15-20µ-× 20-30µ\r\nunilaterally ellipsoid with retuse ends; median spore wall minutely and\r\nirregularly verrucose, yellow-brown at maturity.\r\n\r\nThis species was collected by Professor A. B. Klugh, Kingston, Ontario.\r\nIt is the material upon which the Ontario record for _Mougeotia\r\ncalcarea_ (Cleve) Wittr. is based. Of special interest is the\r\nchromatophore with two pyrenoids, which although an axile plate is\r\ndistinctly two-lobed and forms an easy transition to the next species,\r\nin which the chromatophore resembles _Zygnema_. Type in herb. E. N. T.\r\nCollection No. 2950.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Debarya decussata= nov. sp.\r\n\r\nCellulis vegetativis 16-20µ × 25-50µ cylindraceis; chromatophoris\r\nasteroidiis duobus, singulis cum pyrenoidibus (ut in Zygnemate);\r\nzygosporis vel ovoideis, vel irregularibus, 24-30µ × 30-48µ cum angulis\r\nvel rotundatis, vel retusis, vel productis; aplanosporis uno latere\r\novoideis, 17-25µ × 20-40µ; parthenosporis 15-20µ × 20-30µ; membrana\r\nmedia sporarum scrobiculata, luteo-brunnea; akinetis ad dissepimenta\r\nconstrictis, membrana subcrassa et glabra, 18-20µ × 20-36µ.\r\n\r\nVegetative cells 16-20µ × 25-50µ cylindrical; chromatophores two,\r\nstellate, each with a pyrenoid (as in Zygnema); zygospores ovoid,\r\nquadrate-ovoid, or irregular, 24-30µ × 30-48µ, with rounded, retuse,\r\nor produced angles; aplanospores unilaterally ovoid, 17-25µ × 20-40µ;\r\nparthenospores 15-20µ × 20-30µ; median spore walls scrobiculate,\r\nyellow-brown; akinetes with smooth heavy walls, 18-20µ × 20-30µ.\r\n\r\nType in herb, E. N. T. Collections No. 1177, 1939, 1949, 2686 and\r\n2918. I have specimens from several localities in central Illinois;\r\nWilliamsport, Pa.; Minnesota; Mackinaw, Mich. and Kingston, Ontario.\r\n\r\nThis form is of great interest because of its resemblance, in the\r\nvegetative condition, to _Zygnema decussatum_ (Vauch.) Transeau.\r\nAlso because it shows not only the zygospores, but aplanospores and\r\nparthenospores. In all cases the secretion of cellulose accompanies\r\nthe process of spore formation. The unilaterally placed aplanospores\r\nare strikingly different from those formed by the Zygnemas. In some\r\nof the Illinois ponds it regularly produces only zygospores, in other\r\nponds from which I have collections covering a period of several\r\nyears it fruited only asexually, producing aplanospores and akinetes.\r\nBut several of the collections show all the forms of reproduction in\r\ndifferent cells of the same filament.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of this species suggest that the peculiar _Zygnema\r\nreticulatum_, which was described by Hallas in 1895[B], is in reality\r\na _Debarya_. The fact that the reproductive cells become filled with\r\ncellulose, that the aplanospores are very irregular in form and that\r\nthe vegetative cells contain as high as seven chromatophores, are all\r\nin harmony with this idea. On this basis it is also easy to understand\r\nthe most notable peculiarity of the species—that spores derived from\r\ncells with several chromatophores produce two or three sporelings.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of the two new American species and this Danish\r\nspecies =Debarya reticulata= (Hallas) nov. comb. the description\r\nof the genus needs to be modified as follows:\r\n\r\nVegetative cells cylindrical or constricted at the ends, varying\r\nfrom 1-16 diameters in length; chromatophore varying from an axile\r\nplate with two or more pyrenoids to stellate chromatophores, each\r\nwith a central pyrenoid. Reproduction by zygospores formed of the\r\ncomplete contents of the gametangia; not cut off from the gametangia\r\nby partition walls; but in the process of conjugation, as the gametes\r\npass into the conjugating tube, their place is taken by a secretion of\r\ncellulose. Aplanospores occupying only part of the sporogenous cell,\r\nthe remainder being filled with cellulose. All spores variable in form.\r\nParthenospores and akinetes occur not infrequently in some of the\r\nspecies. The walls of the aplanospores and parthenospores resemble the\r\nzygospores of the same species in their markings.\r\n\r\nThere are now eleven described species belonging to this genus. _D.\r\nimmersa_ W. West and _D. africana_ G. S. West bear a close resemblance\r\nto _Mongeotia sphaerocarpa_ Wolle. _D. Hardyi_ G. S. West has much\r\nthe same appearance as _Mongeotia viridis_ (Kutz) Wittrock. _D.\r\ndesmidiodes_ W. & G. S. West, _D. calospora_ (Palla) W. & G. S. West,\r\n_D. reticulata_, _D. americana_, and _D. decussata_ have characters\r\nin common with the Zygnemas. _D. glyptosperma_ has the vegetative\r\ncharacters common to several of the species, but its spores are quite\r\nunique among the _Zygnemales_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=ZYGNEMA= Agardh.\r\n\r\n=Z. pectinatum= (Vauch.) Agardh.\r\n\r\nThis is probably common in the eastern half of the United States at\r\nleast. In Illinois along with the type occurs the variety _conspicuum_\r\n(Hass.) Kirchner, and a variety with large spores. This latter variety\r\nin fact is more common than the type.\r\n\r\nvar. =crassum= nov. var.

West has studied the reproduction of this species and\r\nfinds that it is a true Zygnema and that the description and figure by\r\nDe Bary, which shows the cutting off of two special gametangia before\r\nthe union of the gametes is at fault, consequently there is no longer\r\nany need of maintaining the genus _Zygogonium_ Kützing.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Z. peliosporum= Wittrock.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of this species have been distributed under the name of _Z.\r\nchalybeospernum_ Hansgirg, in P.

No. 457, from Chestnut Hill, Mass. (G. F. Moore), belongs\r\nto this species as shown by the scattered mature spores. This species\r\nis common everywhere in central Illinois. In the U. S. Natl. Herb, is a\r\nspecimen from Baltimore Co., Md., (J. D. Smith). In Amer. Alg. No. 157,\r\na specimen from St. Paul, Minn., (J. E. Tilden) shows both zygospores\r\nand aplanospores. The aplanospores are cylindric ovoid in form,\r\noccupying the entire cell 30-33µ × 40-88µ, median wall scrobiculate.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Zygnema cylindricum= nov. sp.\r\n\r\nCellulis vegetativis 28-33µ × 28-66µ; zygosporis incognitis;\r\naplanosporis cylindricis vel tumido-cylindricis, 30-33µ × 24-58µ,\r\nsporangia complentibus; membrana media brunnea scrobiculata.\r\n\r\nVegetative cells 28-33µ × 28-66µ; zygospores unknown; aplanospores\r\ncylindric or tumid-cylindric, 30-33µ × 24-58µ, filling the sporangia,\r\nmedian wall brown, scrobiculate. Type in Herb. E. N. T. No. 1164, 1177.\r\n\r\nThis species is not uncommon in ponds, and pools throughout central\r\nIllinois. It was at first classified as aplanosporic material of _Z.\r\nstellinum_ (Müller) Agardh. On going over the specimens in all my\r\ncollections, however, it was found that in no case were the filaments\r\ncontaining the aplanospores connected with the filaments containing\r\nzygospores. This must be the final test of the identity of the species,\r\nas it occurs in some collections alone, sometimes associated only with\r\nfruiting _Zygnema pectinatum_, and sometimes with _Z. stellinum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Zygnema rhynchonema= Hansg.\r\n\r\nIn a collection of algae made at the Minnesota Seaside Station,\r\nVancouver Island, B. C., in 1901, by Professor Tilden, is a form which\r\nperhaps belongs here. The vegetative cells are from 22-28µ in diameter,\r\nand 32-52µ in length, while the European specimens are described as\r\n16-20µ in diameter and 2-6 diameters long. The Vancouver specimens are\r\nproducing both aplanospores (globose, 24-26µ in diam.), and zygospores\r\n(ovoid 24-28µ × 36-44µ) by the union of gametes through the partition\r\nwall separating the two gametangia. The specimens show some evidences\r\nof being in an abnormal condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SPIROGYRA= Link.\r\n\r\n=S. Juergensii= Kützing.\r\n\r\nThe specimen in P. B.-A. No. 510 from Knightsville, R. I., distributed\r\nunder the name of _S. longata_ (Vauch) Kütz. with cell diameter 27-30µ,\r\nand ellipsoid spores 30-33µ in diameter, fertile cells enlarged,\r\nevidently belongs to this species. The spores of _S. longata_ are\r\ndistinctly ovoid with rounded ends. In the Illinois specimens the\r\nspores of _S. Juergensii_ frequently occur with diameters up to 33µ.\r\n\r\n=S. varians= (Hass.) Kütz.\r\n\r\nThe varieties _scrobiculata_ Stockman and _minor_ Teodoresco have not\r\nbeen reported from America. They both occur rarely in Illinois. The\r\nlatter I have also seen in material collected by Mr. Charles Bullard,\r\nat Lynnfield, Mass. The former is characterized by its scrobiculate\r\nspores, the latter by its smaller dimensions throughout. In my\r\nherbarium _S. varians scrobiculata_ is represented in Collections No.\r\n1799, and 1881; and _S. varians minor_ in Collection No. 2951.\r\n\r\n=S. Borgeana= nov. sp.\r\n\r\nCellulis vegetativis 30-35µ × 50-200µ, dissepimentis planis,\r\nchromatophoris singulis anfractibus arctis 1.5-5; cellulis\r\nfractiferis altero latere inflatis, altero latere (in quo conjugatio\r\nsequitur) rectis; zygosporis ellipticis, 33-40µ × 54-70µ, membrana\r\nmedia flava, glabra.\r\n\r\nVegetative cells 30-35µ × 50-200µ, end walls plane, 1 chromatophore\r\nmaking 1.5-5 turns; fertile cells inflated on the outer side, straight\r\non the conjugating side; zygospores ellipsoid 33-40µ × 54-70µ, median\r\nwall yellow, smooth. Type in herb. E. N. T. Coll. No. 1883, 1890.\r\nCharleston, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThis species bears some resemblance to a form of _S. varians_ figured\r\nby Professor Borge.[D] It differs from his figure in that the\r\nconjugating side of the fertile cells is not at all swollen, and the\r\ndimensions are somewhat larger. If this form had been found but once\r\nit would have been passed over as a variation intermediate between _S.\r\nJuergensii_ and _S. varians_. But it has been found several successive\r\nyears in a small stream south, and at a small pond west of Charleston,\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\n\r\n=S. lutetiana= Petit.\r\n\r\nSo far as I am aware no specimens of this species have been found in\r\nAmerica. The Illinois record in my list[E] is an error. The P. B.-A.\r\nspecimen labelled _S. lutetiana_ is _S. fallax_ (Hansg.) Wille, as\r\nshown by its often replicate cell walls, verrucose spores and the\r\nnumber of chromotophores.\r\n\r\n\r\n=S. velata= Nordstedt var. =occidentalis= Transeau.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of this variety have been distributed in the P. B.-A. No. 96,\r\nunder the name of _S. dubia_ Kütz. var. _longiarticulata_ Kütz. from\r\nOak Bay, Victoria, British Columbia (N. L. Gardner). The spores are for\r\nthe most part not mature but they show the characteristic scrobiculate\r\nmarkings of the median wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n=S. Lagerheimii= Wittrock.\r\n\r\nThis species is not uncommon in central Illinois. The\r\nspecimen labelled _S. communis_ in P. B.-A. No. 1416, from\r\nWinchester, Mass., has a cell diameter over 30µ, and the\r\nspores are ellipsoid instead of ovoid. The median spore wall\r\nin the mature spores is punctate. Here also belongs the P. B.-A.\r\nspecimen No. 365, Falmouth, Mass. Both the vegetative cells\r\nand the spores are considerably below the lower dimensions\r\nfor _S. porticalis_. The P. B.-A. specimen No. 1668, _S. porticalis_\r\nvar. _tenuispira_ Collins establishes this name as a synonym of\r\n_S. Lagerheimii_. Professor Farlow has recently sent me a\r\nspecimen of this species from Chocorua, N. H.\r\n\r\n\r\n=S. daedalea= Lagerheim.\r\n\r\nThis species has recently been found in a pond south of\r\nCoffeen, Ill. The spores show the characteristic markings\r\nand the dimensions are near those of the original collection.\r\nThe spores are slightly more rhomboidal than in the type\r\nmaterial, which I have seen. In herb. E. N. T. Collection\r\nNo. 2912, 2850.\r\n\r\n\r\n=S. Goetzei= Schmidle.\r\n\r\nThis species previously known only from the tropics has been found in\r\nthe collection of Mr. Charles Bullard, from Wellfleet, Mass. In herb.\r\nE. N. T. Collection No. 2954.\r\n\r\n\r\n=S. submarina= (Collins) nov. comb.\r\n\r\nThis species was described by Collins as a variety of _S. decimina_\r\n(Müller) Kütz, which it somewhat resembles in the form of the\r\nvegetative cells. The spores, however, are distinctly ellipsoid, while\r\nthose of _S. decimina_ are ovoid. The dimensions are much smaller than\r\nthose of _S. decimina_. It seems better therefore to recognize this as\r\na distinct species. It has been collected in Massachusetts, Connecticut\r\nand Bermuda.\r\n\r\n\r\n=E. ellipsospora= Transeau.\r\n\r\nDescribed originally from Illinois, I have seen specimens during\r\nthe past year from Maine, Massachusetts and Minnesota. Professor G.\r\nS. West[F] described about the same time a species from Columbia,\r\nSouth America, which appears to be a form of this same species. The\r\nvegetative cells are considerably larger, the chromatophores are six\r\n(or five) in number, and the spores are at the upper limit of size of\r\nthe North American form. As our specimens all show, a wider range of\r\ndimensions and number of chromatophores, the South American form is\r\nbest classified as a variety under the name _S. ellipsospora_ var.\r\n=splendida= (G. S. West) nov. comb.\r\n\r\n\r\n=S. propria= nov. sp.\r\n\r\nCellulis vegetativis 60-68µ × 80-150µ, dissepimentis planis;\r\nchromatophoris 3, anfractibus arctis .5-1; cellulis fructiferis\r\ncylindricis; zygosporis ellipticis 42-60µ × 80-120µ; membrana media\r\nsporarum scrobiculis irregularis ornata, luteo-brunnea.\r\n\r\nVegetative cells 60-68µ × 80-150µ, end walls plane; 3 chromatophores\r\nmaking .5-1 turn in the cell; fertile cells cylindrical; zygospores\r\nellipsoid, 42-60µ × 80-120µ, median wall irregularly pitted,\r\nyellow-brown. Type in herb. E. N. T. Coll. No. 2666. Coffeen, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThis species is very distinct in the form of its spores and their\r\nposition in the fertile cells. Lateral conjugation only has been\r\nobserved. It is possible that the number of chromatophores is more\r\nvariable, but in all the vegetative cells in which they could be\r\ncounted there were three.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Spirogyra braziliensis= (Nordstedt) nov. comb.\r\n\r\nOwing to the indefinite and imperfect description of _S. lineata_\r\nSuring., the variety _Braziliensis_ Nordstedt, of which we have a\r\nperfect description and specimens (W. & N. Alg. aq. dulc. exsicc. No.\r\n360), should be given specific rank. Its connection with _S. lineata_\r\nis very problematical.\r\n\r\n\r\n=S. fluviatilis= Hilse.\r\n\r\nIn all the published descriptions of this species the spores are\r\ndescribed as smooth, and the number of chromatophores is given as\r\nfour. I have seen many specimens from Illinois, and collections from\r\nthe upper peninsula of Michigan (T. L. Hankinson), Minnesota (J. E.\r\nTilden), Hawaii (J. E. Tilden), Massachusetts (P. B.-A. No. 1217),\r\nPennsylvania (E. N. T.) and Guatemala (W. A. Kellerman). In all cases\r\nthe mature spores are brown and scrobiculate, and the number of\r\nchromatophores is three or four.\r\n\r\n\r\n=S. nova-angliae= nov. sp.\r\n\r\nCellulis vegetativis 50-60µ × 200-350µ, dissepimentis planis;\r\nchromatophoris 3-5, anfractibus arctis 2.5-4.5; cellulis fructiferis\r\nnon inflatis; zygosporis ovoideis 50-65µ × 80-120µ: membrana media\r\nsporarum reticulata et dense punctata, flava.\r\n\r\nVegetative cells 50-60µ × 200-350µ, end walls plane; 3-5 chromatophores\r\nmaking 2.5-4.5 turns; fertile cells not inflated; zygospores ovoid\r\n50-65µ × 80-120µ: median wall reticulate and densely punctate, yellow\r\nin color.\r\n\r\nThis species was first found in the collections of Mr. Bullard\r\nfrom Beaver Dam, Brook Pond, Natick; the pond west of Winter Pond,\r\nWinchester; and the Middlesex Fells, Mass. Recently the same form was\r\nfound in a large prairie pond south of Coffeen, Illinois. Its position\r\nin the genus is near _S. malmeana_ Hirn. In herb. E. N. T. Collections\r\nNo. 2952, 2953 and 2900.\r\n\r\n\r\n=S. diluta= Wood.\r\n\r\nI first came across this species in Mr. Bullard’s collection from\r\nthe pond west of Winter Pond, Winchester, Mass. On going over Wood’s\r\ndescription, its identity with _S. diluta_ is unmistakable. The\r\nposition, color and form of the spore, and the shape of the fertile\r\ncells is perfectly represented in Wood’s figure. The dimensions also\r\ncorrespond. Wolle is responsible for confusing this species with _S.\r\nnitida_ (Dillw.) Link, but a glance at Wood’s figure is sufficient to\r\nshow that it is very different from that species. The P. B. A. specimen\r\nNo. 513 (labelled _S. nitida_) from Bridgeport, Conn., belongs here.\r\nMiss Grace Stone also sent me a collection of this species from near\r\nNew York City. In the U. S. National Herbarium is another specimen from\r\nBois Sabbi, Louisiana, April 7th, 1891, (A. B. Langlois). Recently the\r\nspecies has been collected at Donnelson, Illinois, by Mr. Frank Harris.\r\n\r\nThe vegetative cells are usually shorter than in _S. nitida_, the\r\nspores are ovoid, not ellipsoid, and the spore wall is verrucose, or\r\nreticulate-verrucose, chestnut brown in color.

Type in\r\nherb. E. N. T. Coll. No. 1939. This variety occurs in a pond east of\r\nAshmore, Ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n=S. submaxima= Transeau.\r\n\r\nThis species which was described from Illinois has been found with\r\nnearly the same dimensions in the collections from Middlesex Fells, and\r\nSouth Peabody Station, Mass., sent me by Mr. Chas. Bullard.\r\n\r\n\r\n=S. micropunctata= nov. sp.\r\n\r\nCellulis vegetativis 30-36µ × 120-300µ, dissepimentis planis,\r\nchromatophoris singulis anfractibus arctis 3-7; cellulis fructiferis\r\nmodo binis vel quaternis inter cellulas vegetativas distributis,\r\nmodo continuis, altero latere (in quo conjugatio sequitur) inflatis,\r\naltero rectis; tubo conjugationis plerumque ex cellula mascula emisso;\r\nzygosporis ellipticis 37-42µ × 57-100µ membrana media micropunctata et\r\nlutea.\r\n\r\nVegetative cells 30-36µ × 120-300µ, end walls plane; 1 chromatophore\r\nmaking 3-7 turns; fertile cells scattered in twos or fours among\r\nvegetative cells, or continuous, inflated on the conjugating side,\r\nouter side straight; conjugating tubes formed almost wholly by the\r\nmale cell, zygospores ellipsoid 37-42µ × 57-70µ, median wall minutely\r\npunctate, yellow. Type in herb. E. N. T. Coll. No. 2470, 2953.\r\n\r\nThis species was first found in the West Big Four Pond, east of\r\nCharleston, Illinois. It has since been found in a collection from\r\nChocorua, N. H., sent me by Mr. Chas. Bullard. It evidently belongs in\r\nthe _punctata_ group of the Spirogyras, but in form and markings of the\r\nspore, and the shape of the fertile cells it is amply distinct from its\r\nnearest allies; _S. punctiformis_ Transeau and the next species to be\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=S. reflexa= nov. sp.\r\n\r\nCellulis vegetativis 30-40µ × 120-300µ, dissepimentis planis;\r\nchromatophoris singulis anfractibus arctis 3-8 cellulis fructiferis\r\nbinis vel quaternis inter cellulas vegetativas distributis, inflatis\r\net valde reflexis; tubo conjugationis ex cellula mascula emisso;\r\nzygosporis ellipticis, 44-54µ × 90-150µ, membrana media glabra et\r\nluteo-brunnea.\r\n\r\nVegetative cells 30-40µ × 120-300µ, with plane end wall; 1\r\nchromatophore making 3-8 turns; fertile cells in groups of 2 or 4,\r\ninflated or enlarged and strongly reflexed; conjugating tube formed by\r\nthe male cells; zygospores ellipsoid, 44-54µ × 90-150µ, median wall\r\nsmooth, yellow-brown. Type in herb. E. N. T. Collection No. 2661, 2664,\r\n2912.\r\n\r\nThis species has been under observation for four years and has been\r\ncollected from ponds near Casey, Lerna, Coffeen and Donnellson,\r\nIllinois. The large, smooth spores, the reflexed conjugating cells,\r\nand the tube produced wholly by the male cells are the distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\n\r\n=S. hydrodictya= nov. sp.\r\n\r\nCellulis vegetativis 75-100µ × 210-360µ, dissepimentis planis,\r\nchromatophoris 7-10, modo subrectis longitudinalibus, modo spiralibus\r\nanfractibus arctis .1-.5; cellulis fructiferis inflatis vel\r\nsubinflatis; tubo conjugationis ex cellula mascula emisso; zygosporis\r\nlenticularibus vel globoso-lenticularibus, 80-120µ × 110-195µ, membrana\r\nmedia scrobiculis obsita, brunnea.\r\n\r\nVegetative cells 75-100µ × 210-360µ, end walls plane, 7-10\r\nchromatophores, either straight, or spiral making .1-.5 turns; fertile\r\ncells inflated or subinflated; conjugating tube formed by the male\r\ncell; zygospores lenticular or globose-lenticular 80-120µ × 110-195µ,\r\nmedian wall brown, pitted. Type in herb. E. N. T. Coll. No. 2661, 2665.\r\nCoffeen, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most remarkable forms described in this genus.\r\nIt combines large size, the lenticular spore form, and the habit of\r\nforming the conjugating tube entirely by the male cell. The conjugating\r\ntube has walls heavier than those of any known species. Conjugation\r\nis both lateral and scalariform, and occurs between scattered cells,\r\nvery rarely continuous for 6-8 cells. In the fruiting condition the\r\nfilaments form a mesh-work which suggests the specific name. It has\r\nthus far been found only in the Fath Pond, north of Coffeen, Illinois.\r\n\r\n\r\n=S. protecta= Wood.\r\n\r\nA study of American specimens of this species from Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut, New Jersey, Michigan and Illinois, shows that like _S.\r\nGrevilleana_ there are always some cells with two chromatophores. I\r\nhave twice found this species producing aplanospores.\r\n\r\n\r\n=S. tenuissima= (Hass.) Kütz var. =rugosa= Transeau.\r\n\r\nP. B.-A. specimen No. 456, Easton’s Pt., Newport, R. I., belongs to\r\nthis variety rather than the type, as shown by the scrobiculate spore\r\nwall. In Mr. Bullard’s collection there are also specimens of the\r\nvariety from Pennannock, N. J., and from Spy Pond, Lake St., Arlington,\r\nMass.\r\n\r\n\r\n=S. Farlowii= nov. sp.\r\n\r\nCellulis vegetativis 24-30µ × 70-180µ, dissepimentis replicatis;\r\nchromatophoris singulis, rarius duobus, anfractibus arctis 2.5-6;\r\ncellulis fructiferis inflatis (ad 39-60µ); zygosporis ellipticis, polis\r\nplus minus acuminatis, 32-45µ × 48-93µ, membrana media glabra, lutea.\r\n\r\nVegetative cells 24-30µ × 70-180µ, end walls replicate; 1 (rarely 2)\r\nchromatophore making 2.5-6 turns; fertile cells inflated to 39-60µ;\r\nzygospores ellipsoid, ends more or less pointed, 32-45µ × 48-93µ,\r\nmedian wall smooth, yellow. Type in herb. E. N. T. Coll. No. 2955,\r\n2956, 2957.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Bullard’s collection there are specimens of this species from\r\nLexington, Arlington, and Middlesex Fells, Mass. The P. B.-A. specimen\r\nNo. 362, labeled _S. Grevilleana_, from Medford, Mass., belongs here,\r\nrather than to _S. Grevilleana_, in which the spores are distinctly\r\novoid with broad rounded ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n=S. groenlandica= Rosenvinge.\r\n\r\nThis interesting form is characterized by quadrately inflated fertile\r\ncells, highly refractive cell walls, and unusually long cells and\r\nspores. In Mr. Bullard’s collection there are specimens from Stony\r\nBrook, South Framingham, Middlesex Fells, Wayside Inn, North Eastham,\r\nand Malden Fells, Massachusetts. The P. B.-A. specimen No. 363 labelled\r\n_S. inflata_, Orange, Conn., belongs to this species.\r\n\r\n\r\n=S. fallax= (Hansgirg) Wille.\r\n\r\nThis species is one of several forms near _S. insignis_ (Hass.)\r\nKützing. If Wille’s description is correct and identical with\r\nHansgirg’s material, then _S. inconstans_ Collins becomes a synonym\r\nof _S. fallax_. Hansgirg’s figure suggests that the filaments in his\r\nmaterial are homosexual. While Wille’s description and figure suggests\r\nthat the filaments are reflexed and that conjugation does not regularly\r\noccur between parallel filaments, with the spores all in one filament.\r\nIt is difficult to decide just where these rough-spored forms belong\r\nas the earlier authors did not pay much attention to spore markings.\r\nIn this connection the note by Professor Nordstedt in connection with\r\nspecimen No. 958 in Wittrock and Nordstedt’s Algae Exsiccatae is of\r\ninterest. Until these forms have been clearly separated by a study\r\nof the original collections it seems best to use _S. fallax_ for _S.\r\ninconstans_, of which the type is P. B.-A. No. 1568. Here also belongs\r\nP. B.-A. No. 1570, Middlesex Fells, Mass., and P. B.-A. No. 1571,\r\nWakefield, Mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n=S. floridana= nov. sp.\r\n\r\nCellulis vegetativis 56-66µ × 120-335µ, dissepimentis planis;\r\nchromatophoris 4-5, subrectis vel anfractibus arctis .5; cellulis\r\nconjugatis abbreviatis, inflatis (ad 135µ) et geniculatis; canalis\r\nconjugationis brevis et latis; zygosporis ellipticis, 75-105µ × 95-135µ\r\nmembrana media glabra, lutea.\r\n\r\nVegetative cells 56-66µ × 120-335µ, end walls plane; 4-5\r\nchromatophores, nearly straight or making a half turn; conjugating\r\ncells geniculate, shortened; fertile cells inflated up to 135µ;\r\nconjugating tube very short and broad; zygospores ellipsoid, 75-105µ ×\r\n95-135µ median wall smooth, yellow. Type in U. S. National Herbarium,\r\ncollected by J. D. Smith, in S. W. Florida, March, 1878.\r\n\r\nIn its dimensions _S. floridana_ is intermediate between _S. stictica_\r\n(Eng. Bot.) Wille and _S. ceylanica_ Wittrock. In several publications\r\nthe statement is made that _S. ceylanica_ is intermediate between _S.\r\nstictica_ and the common forms of _Spirogyra_. A study of authentic\r\nmaterial of this species has shown that it has not intermediate\r\ncharacters, but with its spores having a minutely pitted median\r\nwall, it seems to be intermediate between _S. floridana_ and _S.\r\nillinoiensis_ Transeau, the most specialized form in the Sirogonium\r\ngroup of the genus.\r\n\r\nThroughout the study of these collections the writer has been greatly\r\nassisted by Mr. Hanford Tiffany, now a teacher in the Charleston,\r\nIllinois, High School. It is a pleasure to acknowledge my indebtedness\r\nto the many collectors who have sent me specimens for study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION OF THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY SCIENTIFIC SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the result of the sentiment expressed at the 1914 meeting of the\r\nOhio Academy of Science that the official organ of the Academy, “The\r\nOhio Naturalist,” should be broadened and made more comprehensive in\r\nscope, and feeling that the Ohio State University had no publication\r\nrepresenting the scientific work being done at the institution,\r\nthe members of the Biological Club of the University, in whom the\r\npublication of the “Ohio Naturalist” had been vested, called a meeting\r\nof representatives of the various departments interested in science at\r\nthe university to discuss the advisability of publishing as successor\r\nto the “Naturalist” a journal to be known as the OHIO JOURNAL OF\r\nSCIENCE.\r\n\r\nThe first meeting was held in May, 1915, and committees appointed to\r\noutline preliminary plans.
