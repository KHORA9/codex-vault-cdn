After reading Captain Symmes's numbers, and hearing some of\r\nhis lectures, he wrote the work, it seems, in the first place without\r\nthe idea of publication; but afterwards corrected and enlarged it, and\r\nleft it with a friend of Captain Symmes for publication, sometime in\r\nthe autumn of the year 1824. The nett profits were then, as now, to be\r\npaid to Captain Symmes, towards enabling him to promote and establish\r\nhis principles: but owing to the absence of the author, and other\r\ncircumstances, it has remained unpublished till now.\r\n\r\nThe author has chosen to present the work anonymously; and has\r\nobtained the promise of Captain Symmes to forbear criticising it in\r\nmanuscript,――reserving any remarks or corrections, he may wish to make,\r\nfor future publication. Some _errors of the press_ will doubtless be\r\ndiscovered; as (in the absence of both Compiler and Theorist) there was\r\nno _proof-reader_ at hand, sufficiently versed in the New Theory, at\r\nall times, to detect them.\r\n\r\n  THE PUBLISHERS.\r\n\r\n _Cincinnati, April, 1826._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Public.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following little treatise, was written in the autumn of the year\r\neighteen hundred and twenty-four; when from the urgency of my common\r\navocation, and from a desire to remain _incognito_, the manuscript was\r\nplaced in the hands of a friend of Captain Symmes for publication.\r\nAs it was not my intention to seek a publisher, or make advances to\r\nfacilitate its progress, I left the country for a considerable length\r\nof time, without paying any further attention to the subject. Various\r\ndifficulties intervening, delayed the publication, until _subsequent\r\nevents_, have destroyed my chief inducement; which was, that these\r\nspeculations, compiled from a cursory examination of facts, should go\r\nforth as a harbinger, merely, and not \"_follow in the wake_,\" of public\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n  THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n_March, 1826._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author of the following pages does not write because he is a\r\nlearned man; he is conscious of the reverse; and that his merits\r\ngive him no claim to that appellation; neither does he make this\r\nattempt because he is well acquainted with either the new, or the old\r\ntheories of the earth; but, from having observed that the Theory of\r\nConcentric Spheres has been before the world for six or seven years,\r\nwithout attracting the attention of the scientific, except in a very\r\nfew instances;――few besides the author himself having come forward to\r\nadvocate its correctness. The newspaper scribblers, who have noticed\r\nthe theory at all, have almost uniformly appeared to consider it as\r\na fit subject on which to indulge their wit, the sallies of which,\r\nclothed in all the humour and satire their fancies could suggest, have\r\nin some degree had a tendency to throw around it an air of levity very\r\nunfavourable to serious investigation. But to deal in sarcasm is not\r\nalways reasoning; and the truth is not to be ascertained by indulging\r\nin ridicule.\r\n\r\nConsiderations of this nature, first induced the author to devote a\r\nshort time to the task of investigating a subject, to which he had paid\r\nbut little attention, and to give the several papers, published by\r\nCaptain Symmes, a cursory examination; in the course of which, he noted\r\nsuch of Symmes's principles and proofs as attracted his attention, as\r\nthey occurred; and has since presumed to arrange them in such order as\r\nhis own fancy suggested; supposing that, as they had struck forcibly\r\non his mind, they might perhaps attract the attention of some other\r\nperson, whose habits of thinking may be similar to his own. He has\r\nin a few instances inserted, in addition to those which he has seen\r\nadvanced by Captain Symmes, such reasons and proofs in support of\r\nthe theory as occurred to him at the time. However, he has no claim\r\nto originality; as he has made a liberal use of the publications of\r\nCaptain Symmes, as well as the remarks made on them by others, which\r\ncame in his way.\r\n\r\nThe reader will not look for a complete analysis of the theory in this\r\nshort treatise; it is not intended as such by the author, his object\r\nbeing merely to attract the attention of the learned, who are in the\r\nhabit of indulging in more abstruse researches into the operation\r\nand effect of natural causes; and should it be found to merit the\r\nattention of such, it is hoped their enquiries may be so directed as to\r\naccelerate the march of scientific improvement, enlarge the field of\r\nphilosophic speculation, and open to the world new objects of ambition\r\nand enterprise.\r\n\r\nShould he therefore be fortunate enough to make any observations, or\r\nindulge in any reflections, in the course of the following chapters,\r\nthat may merit the attention of the reader, he hopes they may in some\r\ndegree atone for the many defects which will doubtless be discovered;\r\nwith a sincere wish, that gentlemen of literature and science, who have\r\nmade deeper researches than he pretends to, will have the goodness to\r\ncorrect them.\r\n\r\nThe author does not write for Fame: as anonymous compilers (and it is\r\nthe author's wish to be considered in no other light) can never expect\r\ntheir true names to be inscribed on her records: neither do pecuniary\r\nconsiderations influence him, as he expects to reap no profit from the\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nShould it attract public curiosity to such a degree, as to induce the\r\nsale of more copies than will be sufficient to meet the expense of\r\nprinting, it is the author's desire, and he does hereby direct, and\r\nfully authorize the publishers, to pay over the nett profits to Captain\r\nSymmes, for the purpose of enabling him further to prosecute his\r\nstudies; and to aid him in the accomplishment of his designs.\r\n\r\nWhether Captain Symmes has hit upon an important truth in the economy\r\nof nature, as respects the organization of matter, it is not for\r\nthe author to determine; to the more scientific we must look for a\r\nsolution of the problem; to them it is submitted. The following pages\r\nare presented with no other intention, than as a hint to elicit the\r\nattention of others, who are qualified to investigate, and improve the\r\nsubject. Should they, on examination, consider the matter worthy of\r\ntheir investigation, it will doubtless receive the attention which its\r\nimportance so greatly demands. If it be erroneous, it is hoped they\r\nwill detect, and expose its fallacy to the world; giving at the same\r\ntime rational and satisfactory explanations of the many facts, and\r\nappearances which Captain Symmes adduces as proofs of his positions.\r\n\r\n _August, A. D. 1824._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApology TO CAPTAIN SYMMES.\r\n\r\nSIR――\r\n\r\nTo you I would apologize for the liberties I have taken with your\r\nTheory, and your publications in relation to it, which have made\r\ntheir appearance in the newspapers of the day. When I commenced this\r\ncompilation, in support of your doctrine of Concentric Spheres, I\r\nhad no view to its publication. I had collected all the papers on\r\nthe subject, upon which I could lay my hands, with the intention of\r\ninvestigating the Theory for my own satisfaction: but the scattered\r\nand irregular order in which I found them, and in which they must\r\nnecessarily appear in detached Newspaper essays, published at different\r\nand distant times, induced me to attempt a methodical arrangement, for\r\nthe purpose of facilitating my own enquiries. When I had completed\r\nthis, the same reasons, added to the consideration, that you have not\r\nonly invited, but solicited the investigation of your theory, declaring\r\nit \"as free as air,\" to every person, to make such use of it as he may\r\nthink proper, influenced me to conclude on publishing the result of\r\nmy investigations. Having come to this determination, I have added a\r\nPreface, an Introductory chapter, and a few things in conclusion, to\r\nmake it look more like a Book.\r\n\r\nAs I have not seen all your publications in the newspapers, if I have\r\nnot fully understood, or if I have misrepresented your theory in any\r\nparticular, I assure you it has been done unintentionally――it has\r\narisen entirely from my want of adequate information; and I hope you\r\nwill, in the spirit of candour and good nature, pardon and correct any\r\nerrors into which I may have fallen. Had an opportunity offered, and\r\ncould I have done it with propriety, I should certainly have submitted\r\nthe manuscript to your revision, previous to its publication. However,\r\nas this sketch is only intended to elicit further investigation, and\r\ncan only live until a formal and systematic treatise shall appear from\r\nyour pen, I hope you will permit it to pass as the Pioneer to a more\r\ncomplete demonstration of your Theory of Concentric Spheres.\r\n\r\n  I AM SIR,\r\n\r\n  _One of the believers in that Theory_,――\r\n\r\n  THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n  1824.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nContaining an introductory glance at some of the different Theories\r\nand Opinions which have been embraced respecting the formation of the\r\nEarth, and the reception which those Theories met with from the world\r\nwhen first promulgated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSymmes's Theory; comprehending his description of the form of the\r\nearth, and of the other orbs in the Universe; his principles of\r\ngravity, and the points wherein he differs from the old or generally\r\nreceived theories.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSymmes's Theory supported by arguments drawn from the principles\r\ninherent in matter, and the consequences resulting from motion; tending\r\nto show that, from necessity, matter must form itself into concentric\r\ncircles or spheres, such as Symmes describes the earth to be composed\r\nof.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nArguments in support of Symmes's Theory, drawn from Celestial\r\nappearances.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nThe Theory of Concentric Spheres, supported by arguments drawn from\r\nTerrestrial facts; such as the migration of animals to and from the\r\narctic regions, and from refraction, and the variation of the compass,\r\nobserved in high northern latitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nFacts tending to illustrate and prove the existence of a _mid-plane\r\nspace_, situated between the concave and convex surfaces of the sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nSeveral objections, made to the Theory of Concentric Spheres,\r\nanswered, particularly the one that it contravenes religious opinions;\r\ndemonstrating that the earth, and the other orbs of the universe, are\r\nformed on the best possible plan for the maintenance and support of\r\norganic life.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nGeneral observations on the Theory of Concentric Spheres, with a few\r\nsuggestions to the Congress of the United States, to authorize and fit\r\nout an Expedition for the discovery of the Interior Regions; or, at\r\nleast, to explore the northern parts of the continent of America.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nA few brief suggestions, relative to the description, tonnage, and\r\nnumber of vessels, necessary to be equipped for a voyage of discovery\r\nto the interior regions of the earth; the number of men necessary to be\r\nemployed on board, articles necessary for the outfit, and the probable\r\nexpense attending the same; also, as to the route most proper to be\r\npursued to accomplish the object of the expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nA short Biographical sketch of Captain Symmes; with some observations\r\non the treatment which he has met with in the advancement of his\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THEORY OF =CONCENTRIC SPHERES=.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n _Containing an introductory glance at some of the different Theories\r\n and Opinions which have been advanced respecting the formation of the\r\n Earth, and the reception which those Theories met with from the world\r\n when first promulgated._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt often happens, that those who have been early taught to believe a\r\ncertain set of principles and doctrines as true, whether in philosophy,\r\nreligion, or politics, adhere to them with the utmost pertinacity\r\nduring the remainder of their lives. Any new theory, or principle, is\r\nresisted with peculiar energy; and, however inconsistent or untrue\r\ntheir favorite systems may be, they are disposed to make principles and\r\nfacts bend to them; and would sooner call in question the general and\r\nimmutable laws of nature, than the correctness of their own opinions.\r\nPerhaps this pertinacious adherence to prevalent and received opinions\r\nhas retarded the progress of philosophic improvement more than the want\r\nof bold, original, and enquiring genius.\r\n\r\nIn former times those who cultivated science, or rather those who were\r\ncalled learned, generally based their philosophy on the doctrines of\r\nAristotle; which, as they had been taught to reverence them from their\r\ninfancy, had become almost interwoven with their constitutions. Hence,\r\nthough time has unfolded to us their errors, during several centuries,\r\nsuspicion never hinted their fallibility. The doctrine of the\r\nrevolutions of the earth, and other planets; of gravitation, magnetism,\r\nand other properties now known to belong to matter; have each in their\r\nturn met with a strong opposition from the most learned men living at\r\nthe time of their discovery. But, notwithstanding this opposition,\r\nin all ages, a few bold, enquiring minds have had the firmness to\r\ndissent from the established doctrines of the schoolmen, and to lay\r\nthe foundation of new systems, the correctness of which subsequent\r\nimprovements in science have more or less demonstrated to the world.\r\n\r\nAlthough nearly six thousand years have elapsed since man has been\r\nplaced upon the earth, he yet knows but little of its formation.\r\nNotwithstanding all our enterprise, all our boasted acquirements, and\r\ndiscoveries, its true form yet remains uncertain; and although admitted\r\nthat it is not quite eight thousand miles in diameter, we still have\r\nnever explored its extent. A space of nearly forty degrees of latitude\r\nremains as little known to us, as if it were a part of the surface\r\nof Saturn, or an orb revolving round a star of the eighth magnitude.\r\nWe know nothing of the inhabitants of those regions, or what kind of\r\nanimate beings exist in them.\r\n\r\nIt was a prevailing opinion among the ancients, the correctness of\r\nwhich they for ages never called in question, that the temperate zones\r\nof our globe were alone habitable.――The torrid zone they imagined was\r\ncomposed of nothing but sandy deserts, scorched up by the vertical and\r\ninsupportable beams of a burning sun. The frigid zones, they believed\r\nwere begirt with eternal snows, and \"thick ribbed ice,\" which rendered\r\nthem inaccessible to man, and incapable of supporting animal or\r\nvegetable life. Hence none ventured to approach them.\r\n\r\nSubsequent discoveries have, however, taught us the errors of the\r\nancients. We now know that the torrid zone teems with organic\r\nlife; and possesses, in many parts, a population more dense than\r\nthe temperate, and is equally well adapted to its support: nay, we\r\neven find the temperature of that region to be such that it contains\r\nmountains capped with perpetual snows, which the beams of a July sun do\r\nnot dissolve. It has also been ascertained that the frigid zones are\r\npartially inhabited: but it seems that a certain timid dread, perhaps\r\nin part attributable to the prejudices imbibed from our ancestors, has\r\nprevented our exploring the extent of those regions. However, as far\r\nas civilized man has yet ventured to penetrate towards the poles, we\r\nfind that plants grow, flowers bloom, and human beings make a permanent\r\nresidence; nay, even the untutored savages who reside there tell us\r\nthat other human beings reside yet further to the north; and animals\r\nare known to migrate in that direction. Reasoning then from analogy,\r\nand from what we know, we have no ground to conclude that such a vast\r\nextent of surface has been created by an all-wise Providence for no\r\nother purpose, than to be eternally clothed with mountains of ice. Such\r\na conclusion comports not with the general economy _we do know_ to\r\nexist throughout his works.\r\n\r\nWe are constrained to acknowledge, notwithstanding our improvements\r\nin science, that, comparatively, we know but little of the economy of\r\nnature. Within a few years past, almost an entire revolution has taken\r\nplace in the world respecting the philosophy of light and heat――a\r\nchange which affects the theory both of their nature, and of their\r\ncauses:――They are now believed to be two distinct things, and that the\r\nsun communicates neither, but merely gives activity, in some manner not\r\nyet known, to the principles, or matter, of light and heat with which\r\nour elements abound. If this be the case, as I believe is now admitted\r\nby the learned world, we cannot undertake to say, that the intensity or\r\nthe absence of either, is necessarily dependant alone on the altitude\r\nof the sun, under any particular latitude; or on our nearness to, or\r\nremoteness from, the centre of the system:――For aught we know, both\r\nmay be connected with arrangements that require but few of the sun's\r\nrays to make them answer the purposes of organic life. For aught we can\r\ntell, the planet Georgium Sidus, which rolls eighteen hundred millions\r\nof miles distant from the orb of day, may, nevertheless, be favoured\r\nwith as brilliant light, and as genial warmth as our little globe;\r\nand for aught we know the interior of this planet, in the concavity of\r\nthe spheres, under the equator, may enjoy the same light and heat that\r\nfructify and bless the equatorial climes on the convex surface.\r\n\r\nDuring a period of several thousand years the ancients were of\r\nopinion that the earth was a perfect plane, at rest, and supported\r\nbelow by an unknown something; that it was bounded on all sides by an\r\nimpassable barrier, and covered with the blue canopy of heaven, in\r\nwhich the sun, moon, and stars performed their diurnal revolutions\r\nfor the sole use and service of a few frail mortals. They believed\r\nthat the sun, every morning rose out of the Eastern sea; and in the\r\nevening plunged into the Western ocean; that the stars were lighted\r\nup in the evening by some kind deity, and extinguished before the\r\nappearance of the sun. For ages none doubted the correctness of such\r\na theory. At length, however, from an attentive examination of the\r\nregular appearances and revolutions of the heavenly bodies, some of\r\nthe Babylonians adopted the opinion that the earth was spherical;\r\nrevolving at regular periods round the sun, as the centre of the\r\nuniverse. In this they were followed by Pythagoras and others. But\r\nthose efforts of genius, for the most part, met no other reward than\r\nthe execrations of the exasperated multitude. Such innovations were\r\ndeemed an impious crime against the gods, and could only be atoned for\r\nby the sacrifice of their lives. In those times the people of every\r\nnation, like the untutored Indian of our North Western wilderness at\r\nthis day, considered their own country to be situated in the centre of\r\nthe world, and they, the most favoured people. Even in later times,\r\nwhen the system of the Babylonians, and that of Pythagoras, were\r\nrevived by Copernicus; and, when new discoveries respecting the form\r\nand revolutions of the earth, and other parts of the universe, were\r\nmade by Galileo, not more than two hundred years since, we find an\r\nignorant and bigoted world alarmed at such opinions. We find Galileo,\r\nthat incomparable philosopher, cited before the court of Inquisition,\r\naccused of heresy, and thrown into prison. The charge of heresy against\r\nhim was supported by alleging that he maintained the two following\r\npositions, viz.\r\n\r\n 1. \"That the sun is the centre of the world, and immoveable by a local\r\n motion;\" and\r\n\r\n 2. \"That the earth is not the centre of the world, nor immoveable, but\r\n that it moves with a diurnal motion.\"\r\n\r\nThese positions he was not permitted to maintain or defend, but was\r\nordered to renounce them; and was prohibited from vindicating them\r\neither in conversation or writing. However strange and impious these\r\ndoctrines appeared at that time, subsequent ages have confirmed their\r\ncorrectness.\r\n\r\nWhen Columbus advanced the theory of a western continent, he was\r\nridiculed, persecuted, and contemned, by nearly all the literati of\r\nEurope. It was an idea which had never before entered their minds. But,\r\nnotwithstanding all their opposition and ridicule, the correctness\r\nof his \"visionary theory,\" as they were pleased to call it, was\r\ndemonstrated by the actual discovery of this vast continent, which is\r\nnow sustaining millions of the very happiest of the human race.\r\n\r\nMany of the important discoveries of the immortal Newton, at the\r\ntime they were first promulgated to the world, were denounced as the\r\nsplendid visions of a madman; but, subsequent ages have done him\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nMuch as we may feel ourselves elated on account of the new lights which\r\nhave since been shed upon us, by the further progress and developement\r\nof science; yet, when I reflect on the unkind treatment which Captain\r\nSymmes and his new theory have received in our own day, I cannot help\r\nfearing that we are still, in some degree, under the influence of the\r\nsame feelings and prejudices which brought the earlier philosophers to\r\nthe torture, and the prison. This theory differs much less from the\r\none now commonly received, than the doctrines of those philosophers\r\ndiffered from the prejudices of the multitude, in an age when every one\r\nbelieved the earth to be as flat as a table; and, consequently, it is\r\nbut a small innovation in comparison to what the theory of Pythagoras\r\nand Copernicus must have appeared to be in their day; yet Captain\r\nSymmes has been constantly, and almost every where, represented as a\r\nvisionary and dangerous innovator, and his alleged discovery ridiculed\r\nas the silly dream of a deranged imagination.\r\n\r\nBut let us not turn our backs and give a deaf ear to him, or to\r\nthe discoveries of any other man, merely because they are new, and\r\nin contravention of our previously received impressions. True it\r\nis, novelty is frequently dangerous and hurtful: but on the other\r\nhand, it is often necessary and useful. Without it we should still\r\nremain destitute of many of the greatest advantages we enjoy. Without\r\nthe advancement of new principles, and speculative ideas, neither\r\nourselves, nor any other people, could ever have emerged from a state\r\nof savage barbarity. Without it, what purpose could our reason serve,\r\nwhich, under proper regulations, and by a gradual progress, is capable\r\nof contributing so largely to the general good of society?\r\n\r\nWere it my opinion that Symmes's Theory is one of the wildest and most\r\nridiculous that ever entered into the brain of man, I would not refuse\r\nto hear him; nor by malevolent or satirical disapprobation, attempt to\r\ndiscourage him, before I had examined and reflected upon it. By the\r\nexamination of many speculative subjects, abounding with falsehood,\r\nwe are frequently enabled to treasure up some truths. Some of the\r\nfirst and most important discoveries in chemistry, owe their origin\r\nto the midnight vigils of the alchymists, who vainly sought for the\r\nphilosopher's stone: and many valuable combinations in the science of\r\nmechanics have been discovered by those who wasted years in as vain a\r\npursuit, after a perpetual motion.\r\n\r\nI believe there are but few theories, which do not contain much that\r\nis profitable. The man who has the ingenuity to advance new ones, will\r\nbe likely, in the course of reasoning necessary to support them, to\r\nsay something that is useful to be known. In his very reveries and\r\nwanderings, he will often point out land-marks, which may be useful\r\nto the future _traveller_. Whether then is it better to crouch under\r\nthe tyranny of prejudice, or employ our thoughts and reasoning powers\r\nin the search of truth, though at the risk of deceiving ourselves, as\r\nour predecessors have done? Had it not been for a prudent boldness\r\nin advancing and defending new doctrines, the human mind must have\r\nremained to this day, the sport of all the chimeras of the ancients.\r\n\r\nThe exact shape and formation of the earth are admitted not to be well\r\nunderstood. The laws of gravity, and the admeasurements which have been\r\nmade in different places on the same meridian, have demonstrated to us,\r\nthat the greatest mathematicians have mistaken its real figure. Various\r\ntheories have at different times been published and refuted, and others\r\nsubstituted in their stead. Yet still a shade of darkness and mystery\r\nappears to hang over the subject; for many principles, attractions,\r\nand apparent variations from the established laws believed to exist\r\nin the economy of nature, have been discovered, particularly in the\r\npolar regions, which remain unexplained and unaccounted for. Let us,\r\ntherefore, examine and investigate any theory which proposes to explain\r\nthem. Let us not be so tenacious of our own opinions, and hereditary\r\nprejudices, as to stop at the very point where every thing invites us\r\nto proceed. Let us rather push our researches after knowledge to the\r\nutmost, and exercise our reason, and every means in our power that may\r\ntend to the advancement of science and knowledge. In the pursuit, let\r\nus not be retarded by the cry of prejudice, or the sarcastic whispers\r\nof the narrow minded, and selfish.\r\n\r\nLet us, therefore give Captain Symmes a \"gentle meeting,\" and a candid\r\nhearing, in the following short chapters; ascertain what his theory is,\r\nand on what principles he supports it; and then adopt or reject it, as\r\nour reason may dictate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n _Symmes's Theory; comprehending his description of the form of the\r\n earth, and of the other orbs in the Universe; his principles of\r\n gravity, and the points wherein he differs from the old or generally\r\n received theories._\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Symmes's Theory, the earth, as well as all the celestial\r\norbicular bodies existing in the universe, visible and invisible,\r\nwhich partake in any degree of a planetary nature, from the greatest\r\nto the smallest, from the sun, down to the most minute blazing meteor\r\nor falling star, are all constituted in a greater or less degree, of a\r\ncollection of spheres, more or less solid, concentric with each other,\r\nand more or less open at their poles; each sphere being separated\r\nfrom its adjoining compeers by space replete with aerial fluids; that\r\nevery portion of infinite space, except what is occupied by spheres,\r\nis filled with an aerial elastic fluid, more subtile than common\r\natmospheric air; and constituted of innumerable small concentric\r\nspheres, too minute to be visible to the organ of sight assisted by the\r\nmost perfect microscope, and so elastic that they continually press\r\non each other, and change their relative situations as often as the\r\nposition of any piece of matter in space may change its position: thus\r\ncausing a universal pressure, which is weakened by the intervention\r\nof other bodies in proportion to the subtended angle of distance and\r\ndimension; necessarily causing the body to move towards the points of\r\ndecreased pressure.\r\n\r\nIt is a sound principle of philosophy, that the particles of the\r\ncommon air of our atmosphere are of a repellant quality, and mutually\r\nrepulse each other. The whole system of pneumatics goes to prove that\r\nair presses equally in all directions. Not a single experiment in this\r\nbranch of natural science can be performed that does not depend on\r\nsuch a property. This being the case, if the boundless extent of the\r\nuniverse, beyond the limits of our atmosphere, be an entire vacuum,\r\nwhy should the atmosphere be retained in its present circumscribed\r\nform, and not expand, by virtue of its repellant quality, far beyond\r\nits known height? To prevent this, Symmes believes universal space to\r\nbe filled with an elastic fluid, inconceivably rare, and uniformly\r\ndistributed throughout; differing from common air, and from the\r\nelastic fluids (which also are known to be repellant) existing in our\r\natmosphere. This tendency is what Symmes believes should be understood\r\nby the term gravity; the laws of action governing which he holds to be\r\ntrue, as defined by Newton: and he moreover holds that the application\r\nof the laws of gravity, as laid down by Newton, leads a reasoning mind\r\nto the belief of concentric spheres, with open poles, as all planetary\r\nbodies are in his opinion formed.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the _effects_ of gravity, he pretends not to differ from\r\nthe generally received opinion of the age; but the _application_ of\r\nthem, as to the inner parts of insulated bodies, has enabled him to\r\n_improve_ in a knowledge of the formation of planets; and finally led\r\nhim to form a correct idea of what _constitutes_ gravity.\r\n\r\nThe author of the new theory entertains a belief that the principles\r\nof planetary orbicular forms, developed by him, extend as well to the\r\nmolecules of the most subtile fluids, as to the innumerable stars or\r\nsuns of the universe, and all their planetary trains: he contends that\r\nthough he may not have discovered any new principles in physics, yet\r\nthat he has made interesting advances in a knowledge of the application\r\nof what was heretofore known.\r\n\r\nAccording to him, the planet which has been designated the Earth,\r\nis composed of at least five hollow concentric spheres, with spaces\r\nbetween each, an atmosphere surrounding each; and habitable as well\r\nupon the concave as the convex surface. Each of these spheres are\r\nwidely open at their poles. The north polar opening of the sphere we\r\ninhabit, is believed to be about four thousand miles in diameter, and\r\nthe southern above six thousand.[1] The planes of these polar openings\r\nare inclined to the plane of the ecliptic at an angle of about twenty\r\ndegrees; so that the real axis of the earth, being perpendicular to the\r\nplane of the equator, will form an angle of twelve degrees with a line\r\npassing through the sphere at right angles with the plane of the polar\r\nopenings; consequently the verge of the polar openings must approach\r\nseveral degrees nearer to the equator on one side than on the other.\r\nThe highest north point, or where the distance is greatest from the\r\nequator to the verge of the opening in the northern hemisphere, will\r\nbe found either in the northern sea, near the coast of Lapland, on a\r\nmeridian passing through Spitsbergen, in about latitude sixty-eight\r\ndegrees, or somewhat more eastwardly in Lapland; and the verge would\r\nbecome _apparent_, to the navigator proceeding north, in about latitude\r\nninety degrees.\r\n\r\nThe lowermost point, or the place where the distance is least from the\r\nequator to the verge of the northern polar opening, will be found in\r\nthe Pacific ocean, about latitude fifty degrees, near the north-west\r\ncoast of America, on or near a meridian running through the mouth\r\nof Cook's river, being in about one hundred and sixty degrees west\r\nlongitude, the real verge being in about latitude fifty degrees and\r\nbecoming apparent to a person travelling northward at right angles with\r\nthe magnetic equator, at the distance of about twelve hundred miles\r\nfurther. The verge varies progressively from the lowest to the highest\r\npoint, crossing the north-west coast of America between latitude\r\nfifty-two and fifty-four, thence across the continent of North America,\r\npassing through Hudson's Bay and Greenland, near cape Farewell; thence\r\nby mount Hecla to the highest point; thence tending gradually more to\r\nthe south, across the northern parts of Asia, at or near the volcanoes\r\nof Kamtschatka, and along the extinguished volcanoes of the Fox\r\nIslands, to the lowermost point again, near the northwest coast.\r\n\r\nIn the southern hemisphere, the highest point, or place where the\r\ndistance is greatest from the equator to the verge of the polar\r\nopening, will be found in the southern Pacific ocean, in about latitude\r\nforty-six degrees south, and perhaps about longitude one hundred and\r\nthirty degrees west; and the lowermost point, or place where the\r\ndistance is least from the equator to the verge of the opening, will be\r\nfound on a meridian south or south-east of the island of Madagascar,\r\nin about latitude thirty-four degrees south, and longitude about\r\nfifty degrees east; thence passing near the cape of Good Hope, across\r\nthe Atlantic ocean, and southern part of the continent of America,\r\nthrough a chain of active volcanoes, to the highest point; thence\r\nbearing regularly toward the lowest point, passing between the two\r\nislands of New-Zealand, or across the most southerly one, and the\r\nnorthernmost part of Van Dieman's land, to the lowest point, which is\r\nsouth or south-east of Madagascar; the apparent verge being several\r\nhundred miles beyond the real verge.[2] Consequently, according to\r\nthis formation of the sphere, the degrees of latitude, on different\r\nmeridians, will vary according to their distance from the polar\r\nopenings; and the magnetical equator, which encircles the sphere,\r\nparallel to the plane of the polar openings, would cut the real equator\r\nat an angle of twelve degrees. A person standing on the highest part\r\nof the apparent verge would appear to be under the polar star, or\r\nnearly so, and at the ninetieth degree of latitude. The meridians\r\nall converge to the highest point of the verge, or the ninetieth\r\ndegree; consequently, in tracing a meridian of longitude, you would\r\npursue a direction at right angles to the equator, until you arrived\r\nin the neighbourhood of the real verge of the polar opening, when\r\nthe meridians would change their direction and turn along between\r\nthe real and apparent verges towards the highest point, until they\r\nall terminated at the ninetieth degree of latitude; this being the\r\ndirection a person would travel in order to have his back to the sun\r\nalways at 12 o'clock, the time of his greatest altitude. Although\r\nthe particular location of the places where the verges of the polar\r\nopenings are believed to exist, may not have been ascertained with\r\nabsolute certainty, yet they are believed to be nearly correct; their\r\nlocalities having been ascertained from appearances that exist in those\r\nregions; such as a belt or zone surrounding the globe where trees and\r\nother vegetation (except moss) do not grow; the tides of the ocean\r\nflowing in different directions, and appearing to meet; the existence\r\nof volcanoes; the \"_ground swells_\" in the sea being more frequent; the\r\nAurora Borealis appearing to the southward; and various other phenomena\r\nexisting in and about the same regions, mark the relative position of\r\nthe real verges.\r\n\r\nThe heat and cold of the different climates are governed by their\r\ndistance from the verge of the polar opening, and do not depend\r\non their nearness to or remoteness from the equator. The natural\r\nclimates are parallel to the planes of the polar openings, and cut the\r\nparallels of latitude at an angle of twelve degrees. When the sun is\r\non the tropic of Capricorn, the circle of greatest cold would be about\r\ntwenty-three and a half degrees south of the apparent verge, and when\r\nthe sun is on the tropic of Cancer this circle would probably be just\r\nunder the umbrage of the real verge: hence it follows, if this doctrine\r\nbe correct, that the climate of forty degrees north latitude on the\r\nplains of Missouri, in the western part of the continent of America,\r\nwill be as cold in winter, as the latitude of fifty or fifty-two\r\ndegrees in Europe; and observation has fully confirmed such to be the\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nThe magnetic principle which gives polarity to the needle, is believed\r\nto be regulated by the polar openings, and that the needle always\r\npoints directly to the opening, and of course parallel to a line drawn\r\nperpendicular to the plane of the opening. And when the apparent verge\r\nshall be passed, the needle will seem to turn nearly round, so as to\r\npoint in an opposite direction; having the contrary end north on the\r\ninterior of the sphere, that was north on the exterior, the same end\r\nbeing north on the interior which was south on the exterior. Hence,\r\nwhen navigators arrive in the neighbourhood of the apparent verge, the\r\nvariation of the needle becomes extreme; and when the verge is passed,\r\nthe variation is more or less reversed. The meridians run from the\r\nhighest northern to the highest southern point on the verges; hence,\r\nin tracing a meridian, or sailing due north, we would pursue that line\r\nwhich would conduct us directly from the sun at his greatest altitude;\r\nand when we come to the verge, the meridian would vary, and wind along\r\nthe vicinity of the edge of the real verge, until it brought us to the\r\nhighest point of the apparent verge. The magnetic needle, on arriving\r\nat the verge would appear to cease to pursue the same direction, but\r\nwould in reality continue to maintain it, and lead directly into the\r\npolar opening.\r\n\r\nAccording to this formation of the sphere, a traveller or navigator\r\nmight proceed true north any where west of the highest point of the\r\nverge, say on the continent of America, until he come to the verge. The\r\nmeridian on which he was travelling would then wind along the verge to\r\nthe right, until he arrived at the ninetieth degree; and by proceeding\r\nsouth, in the same direction, he would arrive at the coast of Siberia,\r\nwithout going far into the concavity of the sphere, and without knowing\r\nthat he had been within the verge. Should such a journey be effected,\r\nit would appear to confirm the old theory of the form of the earth,\r\nand put the subject at rest; although pursuing the needle might have\r\ndirected the traveller into the interior, and enabled him to discover\r\nthose fine countries which Captain Symmes alleges to exist there.\r\n\r\nEach of the spheres composing the earth, as well as those constituting\r\nthe other planets throughout the universe, is believed to be habitable\r\nboth on the inner and outer surface; and lighted and warmed according\r\nto those general laws which communicate light and heat to every part of\r\nthe universe. The light may not, indeed, be so bright, nor the heat so\r\nintense, as is indicated in high northern latitudes (about where the\r\nverge is supposed to commence) by the paleness of the sun, and darkness\r\nof the sky; facts, which various navigators who have visited those\r\nregions confirm; yet they are no doubt sufficiently lighted and warmed\r\nto promote the propagation and support of animal and vegetable life.\r\n\r\nThe different spheres constituting our planet, and the other orbs\r\nin creation, most probably do not revolve on axes, parallel to each\r\nother, nor perform their revolutions in the same periods of time; as is\r\nindicated by the spots on the belts of Jupiter, which move faster on\r\none belt than another.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere surrounding the sphere is probably more dense on the\r\ninterior than the exterior surface, the increased pressure of which\r\nmust increase the force of gravity; as the power of gravity must\r\nincrease in proportion as we approach nearer the poles.――Clouds formed\r\nin the atmosphere of the convexity of the sphere, probably float in\r\nthrough the polar openings, and visit the interior, in the form of rain\r\nand snow. And the long continuation of winds, or regular monsoons,\r\nwhich occur in some parts of the earth, may be supplied by winds\r\nsucked into one polar opening and discharged through the other, thus\r\nperforming the circuit of the sphere; without which supposition, it\r\nwould be difficult to account for the long continued winds which, at\r\ncertain seasons, are known to blow constantly for several months, more\r\nor less obliquely to and from the poles.\r\n\r\nThe disciples of Symmes believe that each sphere has a cavity, or\r\n_mid-plane space_ near the centre of the matter composing it, filled\r\nwith a very light, subtile, elastic substance, partaking somewhat,\r\nperhaps, of the nature of hydrogen gas; which aerial fluid is composed\r\nof _molecules_ greatly rarified in comparison with the gravity of the\r\nextended or exposed surfaces of the sphere. This _mid-plane space_\r\ntends to give the sphere a degree of lightness and buoyancy. Besides\r\nthis large _mid-plane space_, perhaps numerous other interstices exist\r\nin the sphere nearer the surface, and of more limited extent. The gas\r\nescaping from these spaces is, no doubt, the cause of earthquakes; and\r\nsupply the numerous volcanoes. This gas becoming rarified and escaping,\r\nmust occasion most of those great revolutions and phenomena in nature,\r\nwhich we know to have occurred in the geology of the earth. This aerial\r\nfluid with which the _mid-plane spaces_ are filled, may possibly be\r\nadapted to the support of animal life; and the interior surfaces of\r\nthe spheres formed by them, may abound with animals, with organs only\r\nadapted to the medium which they are destined to inhabit.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the unfathomable ocean there may be communications\r\nor passages from the surface of the sphere on the outer side to the\r\nsurface of the inner, at least all except the great _mid-plane space_,\r\nthrough which liquid apertures, light and heat may be communicated,\r\nperhaps, to the interior surface of the sphere.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] National Intelligencer of June 10th, 1824.\r\n\r\n[2] A tolerably correct representation of the sphere might be made by\r\ntaking a hollow terrestrial globe, such as are used in colleges, and\r\ninsert a saw at north latitude sixty-eight degrees in Lapland, sawing\r\nobliquely through, so as to come out at latitude fifty degrees in\r\nthe Pacific ocean. The aperture thus produced, will show the general\r\ndimensions and slope of the north polar opening. And in the southern\r\nhemisphere, commencing with the saw at south latitude thirty four\r\ndegrees, in longitude between fifty and fifty-five degrees east, in\r\nthe Indian ocean, and sawing obliquely through, in the same manner, so\r\nas to come out at south latitude forty-six degrees, and longitude one\r\nhundred and thirty degrees west, in the South Pacific ocean, you will\r\nrepresent the appearance of the south polar opening; and the whole will\r\nexhibit a general representation of the sphere, according to the new\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n _Symmes's Theory supported by arguments drawn from the principles\r\n inherent in matter, and the consequences resulting from motion;\r\n tending to show that, from necessity, matter must form itself into\r\n concentric circles or spheres, such as Symmes describes the earth to\r\n be composed of._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a principle laid down by Sir Isaac Newton, the correctness of\r\nwhich is generally admitted, that \"matter attracts matter in proportion\r\nto its quantity and the squares of its distances inversely.\" Captain\r\nSymmes contends that gravity consists in a certain expansive quality\r\nin the molecules which constitute the aerial fluid called æther,\r\nwhich fills universal space, and creates a pushing, instead of a\r\npulling power. However, let either be correct, I conceive it cannot\r\nmaterially affect the principles necessary to constitute concentric\r\nspheres: either principle, I apprehend, would lead us nearly to the\r\nsame results. When matter was in chaos, or in a form not solid,\r\npromiscuously disseminated through universal space, suppose it then\r\nshould at once receive the impression of those universal laws by which\r\nit is governed, and see what would be the consequence.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sir Isaac Newton's principles of gravity, the particle\r\nof matter that happened to be the largest would attract the smaller\r\nin its neighbourhood, which would increase the power of attraction in\r\nproportion to the increase of matter, until all in the universe would\r\nbe collected into one vast body in the centre of space, and there\r\nremain motionless and at rest forever. This, however, we find not to be\r\nthe case; for innumerable bodies of matter, differing in magnitude, are\r\nknown to exist throughout the universe, arranged at suitable distances\r\nfrom each other, and performing certain revolutions in obedience to\r\ncertain fixed laws impressed on them.\r\n\r\nNow suppose all the matter in our globe to be an extended liquid mass,\r\nthe particles so disengaged from each other, as to take their positions\r\naccording to the _established_ laws of matter, and then see what would\r\nbe the consequences resulting from motion and gravity. Taking the\r\nlaws of Newton for our guide, the particles of matter in the centre\r\nwould be operated on by the power of gravity equally on all sides and\r\nconsequently be stationary. Suppose then a line struck through this\r\nglobe of matter, so as to make a globe of half the diameter of the\r\nwhole in the centre, it is plain that the inner globe would not contain\r\nmore than one eighth part as much matter as the surrounding one; hence\r\nit would be attracted towards the surface more than to the centre, were\r\nit not for the attraction of the matter on the opposite side exerting\r\nan influence upon it――but this being removed to so much greater\r\ndistance, would not be more than an equipoise to the other.\r\n\r\nThe diameter of our globe, according to the best observation, is\r\nbelieved to be about 7970 English miles, and its circumference 25,038:\r\nconsequently, if it were solid, it would contain 265,078,559,622 cubic\r\nmiles of matter; while a globe of only half the diameter, would\r\ncontain only 33,134,819,952.[3]\r\n\r\nSuppose our globe divided into parts of one square mile on the surface,\r\nbounded by straight lines converging to a point at the centre, as the\r\nsubjoined figure represents:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nand then suppose there were no other particles of matter in the\r\nuniverse but A and B, A containing 1,328 cubic miles of matter, and B\r\nonly 166, A would attract B so as to make their centre of attraction at\r\nO, which point would become at once the common centre: but admitting\r\nthe whole matter of the globe to exist, A would still exert its\r\ninfluence on B, but both would be operated upon by T and S and the\r\nsurrounding matter, all perhaps, tending to one common centre. However,\r\nI imagine that the tending to the centre would not be so great as is\r\ncontended for by the generally received theory, which alleges that\r\nmatter at the centre of the earth is four times as hard as hammered\r\niron. The Newtonian philosophy appears to contemplate a globe at rest,\r\nand not in such rapid motion as we know the earth and other planetary\r\nbodies to be in, communicating to them a centrifugal force, which tends\r\nto throw matter from the centre. The rotary motion of each planet is no\r\ndoubt regulated by the quantity of matter it contains: so that at its\r\nsurface centrifugal and centripetal forces are equally balanced――the\r\nrotary motion being adequate to communicate a force to counter-balance\r\nthe force of gravity.\r\n\r\nNewton ascertained by his investigations of the properties and\r\nprinciples of matter, the earth to be a globe flattened at the poles:\r\nand the French philosophers afterwards confirmed this fact by measuring\r\na degree in different latitudes. This difference between the equatorial\r\nand polar diameters of the earth, and of the other planets which are\r\nalso known to be of that shape, is ascribed by those philosophers who\r\nattempt to account for such a formation, to the projectile force of the\r\nglobe at the equator occasioned by its rotary motion. This is admitting\r\nthat the matter of our globe was once in so soft a state as to take its\r\nform from motion; for were the earth a compact solid body, and four\r\ntimes as hard as hammered iron at the centre, (as the Newtonian system\r\nalleges) this rotary motion round an imaginary axis could never give\r\nto the globe the form of an oblate spheroid, as is ascertained to be\r\nthe fact; because a hard solid body moving in empty space, could not be\r\nsupposed to yield into that shape by any law of action as yet unfolded\r\nby science.\r\n\r\nBut were the matter of this globe thrown into a confused, disorganized\r\nstate, and then put into a quick rotary motion, such as it is known to\r\nhave, it would throw off from the centre towards the surface, first the\r\nheaviest, and next the lighter substances, which is the very order in\r\nwhich they are found to be arranged, in the composition of the earth.\r\n\r\nThis principle, for it is simply the principle of projectile force,\r\nwill account for mountains, hills, vallies, plains; and for nearly all\r\nthe inequalities on the face of the earth. These circumstances depend\r\non the density of substances composing the earth. Substances of the\r\ngreatest specific gravity are susceptible of the greatest projectile\r\nforce; and hence we find that mountains are composed of heavy masses\r\nof rock, mineral substances, and heavy earths; hills, or the next\r\nhighest eminences, of earth of the next specific gravity; and plains,\r\nor level lands, of lighter substances. Had the earth originally been\r\ncomposed of one uniform substance, sand, for example, of equal fineness\r\nand weight, the whole surface of the globe would have presented one\r\nuniform level or unbroken plain. But, presuming that it was originally\r\ncomposed of, at least, earths of different densities, the heaviest\r\nmasses would be first thrown out and raise their heads above the\r\nsurface of the ocean: thus islands would be formed; and clusters of\r\nislands would form continents, rearing their lofty heads into the air;\r\nand, if the substances of which they were originally composed, were not\r\nas hard as the rocks which we now find on them, the sun and changing\r\ntemperature of the climates, might convert certain kinds of earth into\r\nmasses of stone, increasing in specific gravity by petrifaction, and\r\nother causes, until the towering peaks of the Alps and Andes assumed\r\ntheir present solid form. One continent having thus emerged, another\r\nwould naturally be produced simultaneously on the opposite side of the\r\nsphere, as an equipoise to the first, to keep equal the earth's motion;\r\nuntil all the heavy substances should be thrown out and united in a\r\ncompact sphere.\r\n\r\nTo an observer of the earth the crust every where appears to indicate\r\nthe emergence of land from water: almost the whole surface of the\r\nsolid crust is alluvial, and by reasoning and reflecting, we are led\r\nto the conclusion, that the solid parts of our globe are nothing more\r\nthan a crust, and formed into concentric spheres, in accordance with\r\nthe principles of projectile force. I would ask, what proofs have we,\r\nthat the sphere we inhabit is solid beyond the degree of thickness\r\nnecessary to preserve it from injury by its rapid motion round the sun,\r\nby its diurnal motion round its own axis, and by its motion round its\r\ncommon centre of gravity with the moon? It has been ascertained with\r\nmathematical certainty, that the large planet Jupiter, is more than\r\n1300 times the bulk of the earth, and Saturn independent of his double\r\nring, is about 1000 times the size. If we apply to those prodigious\r\nbodies, the reasoning of Newton relative to plastic forms moving\r\nvariously, there is no just grounds for concluding that they are solid\r\nsubstances to their centres. If they were, their vast weight and remote\r\nposition would require much more attraction than probably even the sun\r\ncould furnish, to keep them within their orbits.\r\n\r\nThe acknowledged and received laws of gravity, together with the\r\nmeasurements made on the same meridian, in different latitudes, have\r\ndemonstrated to us that the greatest mathematicians have been mistaken\r\nas to the real figure of the earth. It is for schoolmen to make exact\r\ncalculations, respecting the force of gravity, and centrifugal and\r\ncentripetal forces; it is for them to determine with mathematical\r\ncertainty where matter, left to its own laws, would settle; for such\r\nundertakings, I acknowledge my incompetency. But I have long had strong\r\ndoubts, whether the laws of gravity are well understood; or whether the\r\nrules on which these calculations could be accurately made, are exactly\r\nknown. However, I take the broad principles of nature, as presented to\r\nmy view, for my guide; and draw my conclusions from what I have seen or\r\nwhat is well known to exist.\r\n\r\nObserve the boy hurling a stone from a sling; he whirls it round his\r\nhead for a minute to acquire a certain degree of centrifugal force,\r\nand although it is not whirled with half the velocity the earth\r\nrevolves on its axis, yet as soon as it is released from confinement,\r\nnotwithstanding the whole power of the earth is operating on it with\r\nall the force of gravity, the centrifugal force which the stone\r\nacquired by the whirling is sufficient to carry it off, at a tangent to\r\nthe circle described by the sling, for a very considerable distance,\r\nbefore the gravity of the earth and atmospheric obstruction can force\r\nit to the ground.\r\n\r\nIf you will take the trouble to examine a mechanic grinding cutlery\r\non a large stone that is smooth on the sides and has a quick motion,\r\nyou may observe that if a certain portion of water be poured on the\r\nperpendicular side whilst the stone is turning, it does not settle or\r\nform itself into a body round the crank or axis; nor does the gravity\r\nof the earth draw it from the surface, but forms itself on the side\r\nof the stone into something resembling concentric circles, one within\r\nanother. The surface of the earth, I apprehend, revolves with much\r\ngreater velocity than any grindstone; and the substances composing the\r\nspheres are much firmer than water.\r\n\r\nMost of us, I presume, have seen persons for amusement, in displaying\r\nfeats of dexterity, place a full glass of wine or water on a hoop, and\r\nwhirl it round their heads without spilling one drop. The centrifugal\r\nforce it acquires by the revolutions overcomes the power of gravity,\r\nalthough nothing appears to support it but the common atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAnother experiment, producing a similar effect, might be made with\r\na cup filled with fine sand. On the surface of the sand, describe a\r\ncircle nearly in the centre; it will then be apparent, on observing\r\nthe cup, that the sand within the circle, provided the particles\r\nattract one another as the planets do, is as much attracted towards one\r\nverge of the cup as the other; owing to its being equally surrounded\r\nby matter or sand, and therefore it can be but very little, if any,\r\ngravitated centrewise. Hence, being in a degree suspended, only a\r\nsmall horizontal rotary motion is required to whirl it towards the\r\nrim or sides of the cup into a circular form; and hence it follows,\r\nthat those particles of sand lying equidistant from the inner side\r\nof the circle of sand thus formed, and the outer side would be in\r\nlike manner balanced, or supported, by being equally gravitated in\r\nboth directions. A disposition would thus be produced to form into\r\nconcentric circles, and it would therefore follow, that successive\r\nsimilar dispositions to subdivision should occur, gradually lessening\r\nin force and quantity. This principle applied to the earth or other\r\nplanets, would cause them to be formed into concentric spheres; and\r\nwould throw the matter from the axis, as well at the poles, as at the\r\ncentre, and thereby constitute open poles.\r\n\r\nAnother simple experiment might also be made, to illustrate that a\r\ndisposition to concentric spheres does exist in nature. On a piece\r\nof paper sift a small quantity of very fine magnetic particles, such\r\nas steel or iron filings, under which hold a loadstone; and you will\r\nobserve that the attractive power of the magnet will cause the filings\r\non the paper to arrange themselves into various concentric circles,\r\nnearly regular and equidistant from each other. From what cause should\r\nthis take place, rather than that the filings should be accumulated\r\ninto one mass?\r\n\r\nVarious have been the conjectures relative to the cause and origin of\r\nthe meteoric stones, or fire balls, which have been known to fall to\r\nthe earth, in all ages, and in various parts of the world. Some have\r\nimagined them to be precipitated from a comet or some of the planets;\r\nothers that they come from the moon; and Captain Symmes's opinion,\r\nI believe, is that they are formed isolated in space by spontaneous\r\naccumulations, as by attracting molecules of matter at first in a\r\nfluid state, which afterwards solidifies by heat or motion. But come\r\nfrom whence they may, they are said to be constituted of a substance\r\nunknown to our geologists; and in several instances the fragments have\r\nbeen ascertained to consist of pieces, some of which have concave and\r\nsome convex surfaces, affording a certain proof that previous to their\r\ndescent, they had been constituted of hollow spheres.\r\n\r\nProfessor Silliman, of Yale college, has preserved some of the\r\nfragments of one of these fire balls; and in his valuable journal,\r\nhas given the public an able description of the facts which occurred,\r\nwhen they fell. This fire ball fell in the state of Connecticut, in\r\nthe year 1807, producing three distinct reports, like a cannon, making\r\nthree convulsive leaps or throes in its course, which were simultaneous\r\nno doubt with the explosions, becoming less luminous after each, and\r\nbeing quite extinguished at the third. Three showers of stones fell\r\nto the earth in a line with its course; the second shower fell five\r\nmiles distant from the first, and the last three or four miles from the\r\nsecond. Some of the fragments were found to be concave, others convex,\r\nand especially on those sides of the fragments which were glazed with\r\nsooty crusted surface, as if vitrified.\r\n\r\nThese phenomena are precisely such as would occur, supposing the fire\r\nball to have been a small satellite, or erratic planet, at first fluid,\r\nwhich had become so condensed by the increased action of terrestrial\r\ngravity, occasioned by its sudden approach, as to cause its fluid parts\r\nto chrystalize and form into, at least, three concentric spheres; and\r\nthe latent heat and light set free by such rapid condensation as to\r\nproduce the meteoric flame; which in this case was almost equal in\r\nlight to that of the sun at mid-day. As soon as the spheres became\r\nsufficiently solidified to prevent the heated aerial fluid, contained\r\nin the mid-plane cavities of the spheres, from passing out with\r\nfreedom, when expanded by the heat; or let the atmospheric air pass\r\nin, in case a condensation within afforded a vacuum; the solid crusts\r\nof the spheres would be disruptured successively one after the other;\r\nlose their regular rotation, and fall in fragments to the earth. The\r\nfall of this body is not a solitary instance of the kind: others have\r\nfallen in many parts of the earth, attended with phenomena more or less\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of January, 1818, in Florida, near Mobile bay, a fire ball\r\nbursted with a considerable report. Immediately before the explosion,\r\nit was observed to project a cone of fire from each pole horizontally\r\nand at right angles with its course. Its bursting like a bomb-shell,\r\nindicated that it must have been hollow; and the two cones of light\r\nwhich appeared, beside its train, showed that it was open at the poles.\r\n\r\nTurn your attention to the general economy of nature throughout\r\nher works, and you will perceive in various and almost innumerable\r\nsubstances that she forms hollow cylinders or spheres in the room of\r\nsolid ones. Enquire of the botanist, and he will tell you that the\r\nplants which spring up spontaneously, agreeable to the established\r\nlaws of nature, are hollow cylinders. If a hollow globe would answer\r\nthe ends of supporting organic life as well as a solid one――why not\r\nbe hollow, as well as a stalk of wheat? or by what laws is the stalk\r\nof wheat governed, that it should _always_ grow hollow? What law in\r\nnature causes the quills and feathers of a bird to be hollow cylinders?\r\nWhy are they not solid? I presume it is for this plain reason, that\r\nnature, throughout all her works, has wisely assigned to every thing\r\njust matter enough for strength and usefulness; and has in no case\r\noverburthened it with unnecessary and cumbrous weight.\r\n\r\nEnquire of the anatomist, and he will tell you that the large bones\r\nof all animals are hollow, and particularly that the bones of birds\r\nare more than ordinarily so: even the minutest hairs of our heads are\r\nhollow.\r\n\r\nGo to the mineralist, and he will inform you that the stone called\r\nÆrolites, and many other mineral bodies, are composed of hollow\r\nconcentric circles; and, that strata of different kinds abound in\r\nvarious mineral substances. Even the earth itself is composed,\r\nas geologists tell us, of various strata, composed of different\r\nsubstances, and varying from one degree of density to another. If\r\nevery part of our globe be regulated according to the received laws of\r\ngravity, and the relative density of matter, why do we find almost all\r\nover the world, light alluvial soil in the vallies and plains; and on\r\nthe tops of the highest mountains, the more heavy granite, and some of\r\nthe heaviest substances that nature knows? We can hardly indulge the\r\nthought that all this is the work of volcanic eruptions or some dread\r\nthroe of nature.\r\n\r\nHowever, if we direct our attention alone to those general laws which\r\nare known, and which are believed to govern matter, I apprehend it\r\nwould be very difficult to account for the creation of worlds, and\r\nthe admirable arrangement which subsists throughout the universe. To\r\naccount for every thing, either according to the old or new theory,\r\nwould be attempting too much. It would be placing the Deity in some\r\ncorner of the universe an idle spectator, whilst matter governed by its\r\nown laws, was forming itself into worlds and systems; the bare thought\r\nof which is irreverent. Is the existence of matter owing to some other\r\nfirst cause, or did matter create itself, and impress upon itself the\r\nlaws which govern it? Such an idea is absurd. We might as well imagine\r\nthat matter created God, as itself. By attempting to trace every effect\r\nto some natural cause, is attempting to do more than we shall ever be\r\nable to accomplish. Such a course of reasoning must lead us to the\r\nconclusion that there is no God, or first cause; or, at least, to what\r\nwould be nearly the same thing, that there is no need of one.\r\n\r\nBut in reasoning upon this subject, I take it for granted, that there\r\nis a God, and that he is the first cause of all things, the creator of\r\nall the orbs in the universe, be they either solid globes or concentric\r\nspheres; and I hope such is the reader's belief. And I cannot discover\r\nin this any thing derogatory from His infinite power, wisdom, or divine\r\neconomy, in the formation of a hollow world and concentric spheres, any\r\nmore than in that of solid ones. I should rather be of opinion, that\r\na construction of all the orbs in creation, on a plan corresponding\r\nwith Symmes's theory, would display the highest possible degree of\r\nperfection, wisdom, and goodness――the most perfect system of creative\r\neconomy――and, (as Dr. Mitchill expresses it) _a great saving of stuff_.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[3] The solidity of the earth is easily calculated by the measure of a\r\nmeridional degree; but the result will be different according to the\r\nmeasurement assumed, as the length of a degree differs in different\r\nlatitudes. \"Notwithstanding all the admeasurements that have hitherto\r\nbeen made, it has never been demonstrated, in a satisfactory manner,\r\nthat the earth is strictly a spheroid; indeed, from observations made\r\nin different parts of the earth, it appears that its figure is by no\r\nmeans that of a regular spheroid, nor that of any other known regular\r\nmathematical figure; and the only certain conclusions that can be drawn\r\nfrom the works of the several gentlemen employed to measure the earth\r\nis, that the earth is something more flat at the poles than at the\r\nequator.\" [Keith on globes p. 56. New-York, 1811.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Mott's translation of Newton's Principia, book 3, page\r\n243, the equatorial diameter of the earth is 7964 English miles, and\r\nthe polar diameter 7929, for as 230:229::7964:7929 miles, the polar\r\naxis.\r\n\r\nCassini, who adopted Picard's measure of a degree, makes the diameter\r\nof the earth 7967 statute miles; others have estimated it at 7917,\r\nand some at 7910 miles. But the estimate which is now esteemed most\r\ncorrect, I believe, is, that the equatorial diameter is 7977 English\r\nmiles, and the polar diameter 7940. From this we may ascertain the\r\nsolid contents of the earth. The axis of the earth then assumed to be\r\n7940 and 7977 miles respectively, the area of the generating eclipse is\r\n(7940 × 7977 × 0,7854=) 49745178,252: and its area multiplied by two\r\nthirds of the longer axis, gives the solidity equal to (49745178,252 ×\r\n2/3 × 7977=) 264544857944,136 cubic miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n _Arguments in support of Symmes's Theory, drawn from celestial\r\n appearances._\r\n\r\n\r\nThat a disposition to hollow cylinders does exist in nature, I\r\nthink, must be admitted; and that a similar principle exists in the\r\nplanetary system, at least in some degree, appears to me as certain.\r\nEvery person has seen or heard of Saturn and his rings. At certain\r\nperiods of time the appearance of this planet, viewed through a good\r\ntelescope, represents him to be surrounded with two luminous rings or\r\nbodies of matter, concentric with each other, and with the body of the\r\nplanet. These rings no where adhere to the body of the planet, but are\r\ndistinct and separate, some considerable distance from him, and from\r\neach other, leaving a portion of vacant space between the planet and\r\nthe rings, through which we see the fixed stars beyond.[4] It is a\r\nfact, I believe, admitted by all, and of which we have positive ocular\r\ndemonstration, that these rings are constituted of some kind of matter,\r\nif not solid, at least to all appearance as much so as the body of the\r\nplanet. Their thickness must be very inconsiderable, for when the edge\r\nis turned to the eye it is no longer visible, except to the powerful\r\nreflecting telescope of Dr. Herschel.――Thus the rings undergo phases\r\naccording to the position of the planet in his orbit, which prove them\r\nto be opaque, like other bodies in the planetary system, and like them\r\nshining by reflection. I am not informed what is the precise velocity\r\nof the rotary motion of the rings; probably their varying aspect, or\r\nsome other cause has prevented a correct observation from being made.\r\nHowever, the planet itself revolves on its axis, with an astonishing\r\nvelocity; and no doubt the rings also, though perhaps with different\r\ndegrees of velocity.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Saturn, I conceive, establishes the fact, that\r\nthe principle of concentric spheres, or hollow planets, does exist,\r\nat least in one instance, in the solar system. And if the fact be\r\nestablished that it exists in one case, is it not fair, nay, is it\r\nnot almost a certain and necessary consequence, that the same laws of\r\nmatter which formed one planet into concentric spheres, must form all\r\nthe others on a plan more or less the same? If we draw any conclusion,\r\nor form any opinion at all, respecting the formation of the planets,\r\nwhose inner parts we cannot see; or if we form any opinion in relation\r\nto our own planet in particular, whose poles have never been explored,\r\nwould not reasoning from analogy bring us to the conclusion, that all\r\nbodies of matter are formed similar to that of Saturn, unless we have\r\npositive proof to the contrary? But it is not in Saturn alone that we\r\nfind proof of the principles contended for by Captain Symmes. Most, if\r\nnot all of the other planets, belonging to our system, whose relative\r\nsituation afford us an opportunity of observation, appear to exhibit\r\nstrong proofs that the same principles prevail throughout.\r\n\r\nThe planet Mars, exhibits concentric circles round one or the other\r\nof his poles, according as either is more or less in opposition to\r\nus. These circles appear alternately light and dark, exactly as they\r\nshould, supposing the planet to be constituted of concentric spheres,\r\n(such as Symmes believes of the earth) the light being reflected from\r\ntheir verges on which it falls; and in which case the vacant space\r\nbetween the spheres would necessarily appear dark.\r\n\r\nSometimes he appears to us with a single ring at each pole. At such\r\ntimes his axis is at right angles, or nearly so, with a line drawn\r\nfrom the earth to his centre. This, I conceive, can be accounted for\r\nby the great refraction, occasioned by the increased density of his\r\natmosphere around the poles, which appears to throw out the further\r\nsides of the verges so as to make them appear like rings, in the\r\nform they present themselves to our view. That such is the natural\r\nappearance may be evidenced by taking a small wooden sphere with open\r\npoles, and immerse it in a circular glass vessel filled with water;\r\nwhen viewed horizontally through the side of the glass, with the plane\r\nof the openings at a right angle with the visual ray, the refraction\r\noccasioned by the water, answering to the dense atmosphere of Mars,\r\nwill apparently throw out the polar openings, and present you with a\r\nview, similar to the appearance of Mars, when his axis is at right\r\nangles to us.\r\n\r\nOur next neighbour, Venus, between us and the sun, (though her being\r\nbetween us and the sun prevents us from having so favourable an\r\nopportunity of examining her poles, as those of Mars, who is our next\r\nneighbour on the side opposite the sun) presents appearances at\r\ncertain times, which seem to lead to the conclusion, that she also is\r\nconstituted of concentric spheres. At times, when this planet is nearly\r\na crescent, we are able to discover a deficient space near the tip\r\nof one of her horns. Admitting Venus to be constituted of concentric\r\nspheres with open poles; and supposing one of the vacant spaces,\r\nbetween two of her spheres about the polar openings, to traverse her\r\nhorn or cusp, at the place where the dark space occurs,――it would\r\npresent to us exactly such an appearance as does actually occur.\r\n\r\nAt other times, one of the horns or cusps of Venus is seen to wind\r\ninward as it were into the body of the planets, extending about fifteen\r\ndegrees further than the other horn. This is an appearance which would\r\nalso be presented, if Venus is formed according to Symmes's theory.\r\nAnd again, supposing one of her horns to terminate around the verge of\r\na polar opening, in such way as to follow the curve of the verge for\r\nsome distance, (which is of course more curved than the periphery of\r\nthe planet) and the same appearances, I think, would occur. The axis of\r\nthe planet not being at right angles with the polar openings, in its\r\nrevolutions one side of the verge would be thrown much nearer to us\r\nthan the other; and the different spheres revolving on their axes with\r\ndifferent velocities would at different times exhibit to our view the\r\nverge of a different sphere.[5]\r\n\r\nThe axis of the planet Jupiter is always at right angles with a line\r\ndrawn to the earth, consequently his poles are never presented to us;\r\nbut his belts, which we can and do see, seem to speak loudly in favour\r\nof a plurality of spheres. The most common appearance of Jupiter is,\r\nthat he is surrounded by four belts; two bright and two dark, alternate\r\nto each other. But they are variable, presenting different appearances;\r\nat some times seven or eight belts are discoverable, at other times\r\nthey appear interrupted in their length, and to increase and diminish\r\nalternately, running into each other, and again to separate into a\r\nnumber of belts of a smaller size. If Jupiter be a solid globe, I\r\nwould enquire, how is it possible to account for those various changes\r\nin his belts, or even for their existence at all? Astronomers, I\r\nunderstand, have heretofore considered the phenomena of Jupiter's belts\r\nas altogether unaccountable. If he be a simple plain globe, those belts\r\ncould not exist; or if they did, they must forever remain uniform,\r\nand not change their size and shape, or relative positions in respect\r\nto each other; neither could the spots on one belt rotate faster than\r\nthose on another. But if we adopt the doctrine of concentric spheres,\r\nand that this planet is composed of a number of them, we can account\r\nat once for all the various appearances in a rational manner. The\r\nbelts would be produced by the shadow cast on the space between the\r\npolar opening of one sphere and the adjoining one; that is, a portion\r\nof the sunshine, would be reflected from the verges of the spheres\r\non which it fell; and another portion would appear to be swallowed\r\nby the intervening space. And if refraction bends the rays of vision\r\nbetween and under his spheres, as it bends a portion of the rays of the\r\nsun, so as to produce the apparent belts of comparative shade, then a\r\nvery complete solution of those appearances, heretofore considered\r\nwonderful, would be afforded. The variation which has been observed in\r\ntheir number, shape, and dimensions, can in no way be better accounted\r\nfor, than by concluding the planet to be constituted of a number of\r\nconcentric spheres, of different breadths, revolving on different\r\naxes, and with different velocities, so as sometimes to present to our\r\nview the verge of one sphere, and sometimes that of another: and the\r\nrays of the sun falling on the parts of the verges presented to us,\r\nwould occasion the diversified appearances which we discover. If some\r\nsections of both crusts of the spheres be formed of water alone, and\r\nbecome occasionally transparent, it will afford an additional reason\r\nfor the varying phenomena attendant on these appearances, which may\r\nalso be increased by alternate regions of water, ice, dry land, and\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nModern astronomers have long noticed the spots frequently visible on\r\nthe sun. They are described as having the appearance of vast holes,\r\nor fractures, in his outer surface or crust, through which an inner\r\nappears to be seen. This, also, seems to favour the doctrine of\r\ndifferent spheres. Notwithstanding the sun revolves very slowly on his\r\naxis, it is probable that his poles are open to a greater or less\r\nextent; but we can never see into them, owing perhaps to the earth,\r\nnever being very far from the plane of the sun's equator, his being\r\nsuch a vast deal larger than the earth, and the atmosphere surrounding\r\nhim so extremely luminous.\r\n\r\nVery little doubt exists in my mind, that the poles of the sun and\r\nof Jupiter would appear somewhat like those of Mars or the rings of\r\nSaturn, were it not that the two former never present their axes, in\r\nany perceptible degree, towards us; neither does our satellite, the\r\nmoon, ever present either of her poles to us: hence, though this may\r\nbe in some degree open, (notwithstanding her slow rotation) owing to\r\nher axis always being nearly at right angles with a line drawn to the\r\nearth, we are not able to see whether they are open or not,――more\r\nespecially as her atmosphere is so light and rare as not to produce\r\nmuch refraction. The vast round deep caverns observable on the surface\r\nof the moon, appear as if they might once have been polar openings; if\r\nso, she must frequently have changed her axis.\r\n\r\nThe spots of light which have at different periods been discovered by\r\nastronomers, on the surface of the moon, near her poles, when she was\r\non the face of the sun, in an eclipse of that luminary, are perhaps\r\nbest accounted for by supposing the sun to shine in, either at one\r\nof her polar openings or through a cavity on her further side, and\r\nappearing to us through one of her annular cavities, on this side, and\r\nnear her poles: Or the sun being much larger than the moon, and the\r\naxis of the moon a little varied from right angles with the earth, (or\r\nperhaps the low side of the sphere being next to the earth,) the sun\r\nwould shine through an annular cavity or open pole, so as to appear to\r\nus as a spot of light on the moon's disk.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing enumerated astronomical phenomena are some of the facts\r\ntending to confirm and elucidate Symmes's theory. They all have been\r\nlong known to exist; yet I have never heard them accounted for to\r\nthe satisfaction of my mind. Indeed, I believe some of them never\r\nwas attempted to be accounted for in any manner whatever. I would,\r\ntherefore, request the reader, who may deign to give the subject\r\na serious thought, to reflect, that if all the celestial orbs are\r\nentire round globes, as the old theory considers them to be, on\r\nwhat principles, or in what manner, could they present the various\r\nappearances which I have enumerated? Why should the horns of Venus\r\nassume different shapes? What would make the appearance of belts on\r\nJupiter? Or rings and concentric circles at the poles of Mars? And,\r\nfinally, in what position could a round solid globe be placed, to\r\nexhibit the rings of Saturn, revolving with different velocities, as\r\nit respects each other, and spaces appearing between them and the body\r\nof the planet, through which stars, millions of miles beyond, can be\r\ndistinctly seen? These are phenomena I should like to hear explained.\r\nOn the principle of concentric spheres, they can all be accounted\r\nfor in a most satisfactory manner. They appear perfectly plain and\r\nintelligible. What was thought to be involved in inexplicable mystery,\r\nand mid-night darkness now perfectly accords with the established laws\r\nof nature, and can be understood by the most ordinary capacity.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] Physical World, p. 42.――Adam's Philosophy, vol. 4, p. 206;\r\nPhiladelphia, 1807.\r\n\r\n[5] \"Dr. Herschel has observed a faint illumination in the unlighted\r\npart of the planet Venus, which he ascribes to some phosphoric quality\r\nof its atmosphere.\" Editor's note to Adams' Philosophy, vol. 4, p. 204,\r\nPhiladelphia, 1807.\r\n\r\n_Quere_――Might not such an appearance be accounted for as rationally,\r\nby supposing the rays of the sun to shine or be reflected, through\r\none of her polar openings, and fall on the verge of the sphere at the\r\nopposite polar opening?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n _The Theory of Concentric Spheres, supported by arguments drawn from\r\n Terrestrial facts; such as the migration of animals to and from the\r\n arctic regions, and from refraction, and the variation of the compass,\r\n observed in high northern latitudes._\r\n\r\n\r\nI would now advert to a few of the known terrestrial facts, which have\r\na tendency to support the theory advanced by Captain Symmes; such as\r\nthe migration of animals, including beasts, birds, and fishes, in the\r\narctic regions; and from refraction, and the variation of the compass\r\nobserved in high northern latitudes.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact well attested by whalers and fishers in the northern\r\nseas; and one that almost every author who adverts to the northern\r\nfisheries confirms, that innumerable and almost incredible numbers of\r\nwhales, mackerel, herring, and other migratory fish, annually come\r\ndown in the spring season of the year, from the artic seas towards\r\nthe equator. Some authors describe the shoals of herring alone, to\r\nbe equal in surface to the island of Great Britain. Besides these,\r\ninnumerable shoals of other fish also come down. These fish when they\r\nfirst come from the north in the spring, are in their best plight and\r\nfattest condition: but as the season advances, and they move on to the\r\nsouthward, they become poor; so much so, that by the time they get on\r\nthe coast of France, or Spain, as fishermen say, they are scarce worth\r\ncatching.\r\n\r\nThe history of the migratory fish affords strong grounds to conclude,\r\nthat the shoals which come from the north, are like swarms of bees from\r\nthe mother hive, never to return; particularly the herring and other\r\nsmall fish. They are not known to return in shoals: and it is doubted\r\nby some writers on the subject whether any of them ever return north\r\nagain, or whether they are not entirely consumed by men, and by other\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nWhalers and other fishermen who go to the north, generally prosecute\r\ntheir business in the seas between latitudes sixty and seventy degrees,\r\nwhere whales are most abundant. Pinkerton, in his voyages, states, that\r\nthe Dutch, who at different periods got detained in the ice, and were\r\ncompelled to winter in high northern latitudes, could find but few\r\nfish to subsist on during the winter: which proves that the migrating\r\nfish do not winter amongst, or on this side of the ice.――All these\r\nfacts relative to fish, appear to be well authenticated. Now, were the\r\nearth a compact and solid spheroid, according to the old theory; and\r\nwere the seas frozen nearly to the bottom at the poles, as we would\r\nbe led to conclude, where could all those fish, that come down to us\r\nevery spring, breed? or, if they even all returned in the autumn,\r\nand all the north were a sea that did not freeze even to the poles,\r\nit would require a great stretch of credulity to imagine where they\r\ncould obtain food for the winter; or even if their source of food were\r\ninexhaustible, could the region of the pole afford space sufficient for\r\ntheir health, so as to migrate south in the spring? If the earth be\r\nnot hollow, (or at least greatly concave about the poles) where could\r\nall those fish find room in winter? But on Symmes's plan, admitting\r\nthe globe to be a hollow sphere, and the inner, or concave part, as\r\nhabitable as without, (at least as habitable for fish) the whole matter\r\nis at once explained.\r\n\r\nWhales, and various fish, delight in cold regions. According to\r\nSymmes's Theory, a zone at a short distance beyond the real verge of\r\nthe sphere, (which constitutes the coldest part, or as he has thought\r\nproper to term it, \"the icy circle,\") commencing at the highest point,\r\nin about latitude sixty-eight degrees, in the northern sea, near\r\nNorway, thence gradually declining to about latitude fifty degrees in\r\nthe Pacific ocean, which is the lowest point, and thence regularly\r\nround again to the highest point. A certain distance beyond this, and\r\nshort of the apparent verge, this zone, or icy circle exists, which is\r\nbelieved to be the coldest region of the earth. After passing this, we\r\nwould advance into the interior of the globe, and into a milder clime.\r\nIn the interior region, it is contended, those immense shoals of fish\r\nare propagated and grow, which annually come out and afford us such\r\nan abundant supply: nor does it appear that the interior parts of the\r\nsphere are altogether forsaken by the fish in summer; for shoals of fat\r\nmackerel and herring come down from the north in autumn, as well as in\r\nthe spring.\r\n\r\nThe seal, another animal found in cold regions, is also said to migrate\r\nnorth twice each year; going once beyond the icy circle to produce\r\ntheir young; and again to complete their growth, always returning\r\nremarkably fat――an evidence that they find something more than snow\r\nand ice to feed on in the country to which they migrate.\r\n\r\nNumerous other facts of importance, relative to the migration\r\nof quadrupeds, are well authenticated by travellers and others:\r\nparticularly that of the rein-deer. In Rees's Cyclopedia, under the\r\nhead, \"Hudson's Bay,\" it is stated, that the rein-deer are seen in\r\nthe spring season of the year, about the month of March or April,\r\ncoming down from the north, in droves of eight or ten thousand, and\r\nthat they are known to return northward in the month of October, when\r\nthe snow becomes deep. Hudson's Bay is situated between sixty and\r\nsixty-five degrees north latitude. We are informed by professor Adams\r\nof St. Petersburgh, that on the northern coast of Asia, every autumn\r\nthe rein-deer start north-eastwardly from the river Lena, and return\r\nagain in the spring, in good condition: the mouth of the river Lena\r\nis in about latitude seventy degrees north. This appears to me rather\r\na mystery according to the old theory of the earth, for why should\r\nthose deer when the cold commences, seek a colder climate, and a more\r\nsterile country? The inhospitable coast of Liberia and Hudson's Bay, in\r\nthe gloom of a dark winter, I should suppose, would be cold enough,\r\nwithout their seeking to spend the winter among nothing but eternal\r\nmountains of ice at the pole; where nature must be robed in snows and\r\ncrowned with storms.\r\n\r\nHearne, who travelled very high north and northwest on the continent\r\nof America, details various facts in his journal, which strongly\r\ncorroborate Symmes's position. Some of the facts he attempts to explain\r\nagreeably to his own ideas, and others he considers inexplicable.\r\nAmong a great collection of facts, he states, that large droves of\r\n_musk-oxen_ abound within the arctic circle, few of which ever come\r\nso far south as the Hudsons-Bay factories. He mentions seeing in the\r\ncourse of one day, several herds of those animals, of seventy or eighty\r\nin a herd, in about latitude sixty-eight degrees. He states that the\r\npolar white bears are very rarely found by any of the Indians in\r\nwinter; and that their winter retreats appear to be unknown;[6] that\r\nthey are sometimes seen retiring towards the sea on the ice in autumn;\r\nand appear again in great numbers in the latter end of March, bringing\r\ntheir young with them.\r\n\r\nHearne also states, that the white or arctic foxes are, some years,\r\nremarkably plentiful; and always come from the north; that their\r\nnumbers almost exceed credibility; that it is well known none of them\r\never migrate again to the northward; and that naturalists are at a\r\nloss to know where they originate.[7] He also mentions that all kinds\r\nof game, as well as fish, in those high latitudes, are at some seasons\r\nexcessively plentiful, and at others extremely scarce.\r\n\r\nThese facts strongly corroborate the doctrine of a hollow sphere:\r\notherwise, why should the rein-deer, and other animals, migrate north\r\ninstead of south; as our Buffalo on the plains of Missouri do, when\r\npressed with snow and cold weather? Instinct generally leads animals\r\nto fruitful and productive, rather than unproductive, regions; why\r\nthen proceed north on the approach of winter, unless in expectation\r\nof finding a warmer climate, or, at least, a more mild and plentiful\r\ncountry, beyond the icy circle? Independent of the immense droves of\r\nrein-deer, great numbers of musk-oxen, white bears, and white foxes,\r\nspend their winters towards the north; which tends to establish the\r\nfact, that a considerable extent of land must exist in that quarter\r\nof the earth. This, however, would infringe on the space necessary to\r\naccommodate the vast quantities of fish which appear to be propagated\r\nin that region, if the old system were true.\r\n\r\nIf we were to judge of the internal surface of the sphere, by\r\nits animal productions,――admitting that those animals heretofore\r\nenumerated, are propagated there,――we should conclude that the internal\r\nregion of the earth is as much more favourable to the support of animal\r\nlife, as the rein-deer is larger than our deer, and the white bear\r\nlarger than our bear; and, consequently, we must conclude that there\r\nare more salubrious climates and better countries within, than any we\r\nhave yet discovered without.\r\n\r\nHearne also informs us that swans, geese, brants, ducks, and other\r\nwild water-fowl, are so numerous about Hudson's Bay, in the spring and\r\nsummer, that the company every season salt up vast quantities of them,\r\nsometimes sixty or seventy hogs-heads.[8] He enumerates ten different\r\nspecies of geese, several of which, (particularly the snow geese, the\r\nblue geese, brent geese, and horned wavey,) lay their eggs and raise\r\ntheir young in some country unknown, even to the Indians;[9] as their\r\neggs and young are never seen by them, neither have the most accurate\r\nobservers been able to discover where they make their winter residence;\r\nas it is well known that they do not migrate to the southward; but\r\nfew of them ever pass to the south, and some of the species are said\r\nnever to have been seen south of latitude fifty-nine degrees.[10] Most\r\nof those fowls molt or shed their feathers in a peculiar manner, in\r\nsummer, and become nearly naked. Hence it would seem that they must\r\nbreed in winter while absent, for it is impossible that they could lay\r\nand sit whilst molting; whereas, the migratory geese and ducks of this\r\ncountry are not known to shed their feathers, in any great degree; and\r\nare well known to raise their young in the summer, whilst in the north.\r\nIt may, therefore, be inferred, that many of those water-fowls, which\r\nHearne describes, raise their young beyond the icy circle and within\r\nthe sphere. As many of the ten species of geese he saw there, are\r\nunknown further south, it establishes the fact, that they do not come\r\nto the south to winter.\r\n\r\nIn the papers of the Honourable D. Barrington, and Colonel Beaufoy, on\r\nthe possibility of approaching the north pole, read before the Royal\r\nSociety of London, there is an extensive collection of instances cited,\r\nwhere navigators have reached high northern latitudes; from which it\r\nappears to be well authenticated, that navigators have in numerous\r\ninstances reached the latitude of eighty-two, eighty-three, and\r\neighty-four degrees:[11] and some are said to have sailed as far north\r\nas eighty-eight and eighty-nine degrees.[12] It is almost uniformly\r\nstated, that in those high latitudes, the sea is clear of ice, or\r\nnearly so, and the weather moderate.[13] To cite the various instances\r\nin which navigators have sailed far north, would be too tedious:[14]\r\nthe whole book principally consists of a series of facts, which have\r\na strong bearing on the subject, and to which I would refer the reader\r\nwho feels disposed to investigate. The whole appears to strengthen the\r\nopinion, that there is a barrier, or circle of ice, about where the\r\nwhalers go to fish; but, when that is passed, we come to an open sea,\r\nand a more temperate region.\r\n\r\nThe sea is stated to be open, and always clear of ice, even in the\r\nmiddle of winter, on the northern part of Spitzbergen, which is\r\nsituated in latitude eighty degrees north; and the further north the\r\nmore clear it is of ice.[15] But, at the same season, on the southern\r\nparts of Spitzbergen, the sea is bound up with solid and compact ice.\r\n\r\nIf the doctrine be true, that the earth is a solid spheroid, the cold\r\nmust increase regularly as we approach the pole, and, consequently,\r\nvegetation invariably diminish: this, however, is ascertained not\r\nto be the fact. Nova-Zembla, which is situated in north latitude\r\nseventy-six degrees, produces no timber, nor even a blade of grass,[16]\r\nconsequently, all the quadrupeds which frequent it, are foxes and\r\nbears; both carniverous animals. On the coast of Greenland, about\r\nlatitude sixty-five and seventy degrees, neither timber nor grass\r\ngrows;[17] while on the northern parts of Spitzbergen, they have\r\nrein-deer, which are often exceedingly fat; and Mr. Grey mentions\r\nthree or four species of plants which grow and flower there, during the\r\nsummer.[18]\r\n\r\nOn any meridian passing through England, it is ascertained to be\r\nmore temperate at the latitude of eighty degrees north, than at\r\nseventy-three degrees:[19] and both Pinkerton and Barrington inform\r\nus, that beyond the latitude of seventy-five degrees, the north winds\r\nare frequently warm in winter;[20] that in the middle of winter for\r\nseveral weeks, there falls almost continued rain; and that vegetables\r\nand animals are more abundant at the latitude of eighty degrees than at\r\nseventy-six degrees.\r\n\r\nIt has long been observed that the climates vary very considerably\r\non the same parallels of latitude. New York, which is situated in\r\nlatitude 40 degrees, is known to be considerably colder in the winter\r\nthan London, which is situated in latitude fifty-five degrees; and the\r\nparallel of latitude forty degrees on the plains of Missouri is much\r\ncolder than the city of New-York. The climate at St. Peters, on the\r\nMississippi, which is in latitude forty-six degrees, is said to be\r\nconsiderably colder than Quebec.[21] This difference of climate has, by\r\nsome, been attempted to be accounted for, on the principle that land\r\nis colder than water, and that the cold is occasioned by the large\r\nportion of land in the continent of America: however, I submit to the\r\nconsideration of the reader, whether so great a difference could arise\r\nfrom a cause of this nature.\r\n\r\nIn the northern sea, between Spitzbergen and the continent of America,\r\nthere is a strong current, which always comes from the north, and\r\nsets southwardly.[22] It has been stated by some, that, in the spring\r\nseason of the year, the water of this current is warmer and fresher\r\nthan the surrounding water of the sea. Various other currents have,\r\nat different times, been observed, in different parts of the sea,\r\nsetting from the north. Floating southwardly on these currents, have\r\nbeen seen large masses of ice, from fresh water rivers, with wolves\r\nand bears occasionally on them. New fallen trees have also been seen\r\nfloating from the north; and various kinds of timber, some of which\r\nthe species have hitherto been unknown, are frequently found lodged\r\non the northern part of the coast of Norway, having drifted from some\r\nregion still farther north. Trees have also been found floating in the\r\nocean at latitude eighty degrees; when no timber is known to grow north\r\nof latitude seventy degrees. Also, seeds unknown to our botanists,\r\nand those of tropical plants have been found drifted on the coast of\r\nNorway, and parts adjacent, many of which were in so fresh a state\r\nas to vegetate and grow;[23] when it is well known that no plant of\r\ntheir species comes to perfection in any known climate far without the\r\ntropics. And, what makes the matter particularly extraordinary, is,\r\nthat these things appear to be drifted by currents coming from the\r\nnorth; when, according to the old theory, we must believe the sea to\r\nbe always frozen at the poles, which would render it difficult, if not\r\nimpossible, to account for the existence of the currents at all.\r\n\r\nIn the United States of America, and in Europe, the Aurora Borealis\r\nis always seen to the north: But many of those travellers and\r\nnavigators, who penetrated to high northern latitudes, observed the\r\nAurora Borealis in the south, and never in the north. The region in\r\nwhich it is believed to exist, is supposed to be about the place where\r\nthe verge commences, and about fifty or sixty miles above the plane\r\nof the earth's surface; and that the travellers who discovered these\r\nappearances south of them, were at that time beyond the verge.\r\n\r\nThe Indians discovered by Captain Ross, on the coast of Baffin's bay,\r\nin the summer of 1818, in latitude seventy-five degrees fifty-five\r\nminutes north, when interrogated from whence they came, pointed to\r\nthe north, where, according to their account, there were \"plenty of\r\npeople;\"[24] that it was a warmer country; and that there was much\r\nwater there. And when Captain Ross informed them that he came from the\r\ncontrary direction, pointing to the south, they replied, \"that could\r\nnot be, because there was nothing but ice in that direction:\"[25]\r\nConsequently these people must live in a country not composed of ice;\r\nfor it appears they deem such an one uninhabitable. Hence we must\r\ninfer, if the relation given by Captain Ross be correct, that, north of\r\nwhere they then were, the climate becomes more mild, and is habitable;\r\na change, the cause of which is not easily accounted for on the old\r\nphilosophic principles.\r\n\r\nIn high northern latitudes, owing to refraction, or some other peculiar\r\ncircumstance, which hitherto has not, to my knowledge, been attempted\r\nto be accounted for, the extent of vision appears to be greatly\r\nincreased; so that objects, much further than the ordinary distance,\r\nare distinctly seen; frequently appearing elevated above the sea, or\r\ntheir real situation; and their image sometimes pictured in the sky.\r\nThe real objects, themselves, are sometimes seen with the naked eye one\r\nhundred and forty or one hundred and fifty miles,[26] and sometimes\r\nat the astonishing distance of two hundred miles. These facts are\r\nwell attested by Captain Ross and other navigators. How this can be\r\naccounted for, on the formation maintained by the old theory, I cannot\r\nconjecture. I believe it is admitted that the deck of a vessel at sea,\r\nany where between the equator and latitude fifty or sixty degrees,\r\ncannot be discovered, even by the best telescope, at a greater distance\r\nthan twelve or fifteen miles.[27] Nay, were there no end to vision, and\r\ncould the eye penetrate two hundred miles through our atmosphere with\r\nsufficient clearness, it would require an observer to be elevated about\r\nfive miles, before he could discover an object on the surface of the\r\nearth two hundred miles distant. But, on the edge of the verge of the\r\npolar opening, if the atmosphere were clear, and the power of vision\r\nstrong enough, an observer might discover objects situated on the verge\r\nat any point all round the sphere; as they would be on an exact plane\r\nwith the observer. And on the contrary, travelling across the verge\r\nfrom the convexity to the concavity of the sphere, a very few miles\r\nmake objects disappear.\r\n\r\nAll northern navigators and travellers agree, that high north the\r\nsun becomes less bright, and the sky darker, than in more southern\r\nlatitudes. Is not this owing to the rays of the sun being refracted\r\nround the verge of the polar opening? Another circumstance, observed\r\nby navigators, who have visited high latitudes is, that the latitude\r\nand longitude, as found by celestial observation, frequently differ\r\nvery materially, sometimes as much as one half, from that given by\r\nthe log-line.[28] It has also been observed that the mercury in the\r\nbarometer is less fluctuating in northern regions, than it is further\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nThose appearances observed in the southern hemisphere, which are termed\r\nMagellanic clouds, by navigators, have not, so far as I know, been\r\naccounted for. They are three in number, of an irregular shape, and\r\nobserved by night in the South Atlantic, and the south-east parts of\r\nthe Pacific oceans, (reversed from New-Holland and New-Zealand,) but\r\nnever visible in the eastern parts of the Indian ocean: their colour\r\nis like that of far distant mountains, on which the sun is shining. In\r\nthe one sea they appear due south, and in the other to the left. They\r\nare stationary, appearing perpetually fixed at a certain height, and\r\nin a particular situation, as viewed from any given place. The stars\r\nand the heavens, in their diurnal revolutions, sweep by them, and they\r\nremain the same. To the navigator, who proceeds to the east or west,\r\nthey appear to be more or less to the right or left of the meridian,\r\nin proportion as he changes his longitude; and as he sails south, they\r\nincrease in height, until they reach the zenith, and finally become\r\nnorth, when seen by an observer south of the straits of Magellan, which\r\nis in latitude fifty-two degrees south. Captain Symmes accounts for\r\nthe appearance of these clouds by the great refractive power of the\r\natmosphere about the polar openings; causing the opposite side of the\r\nverge to appear pictured in the sky, as navigators inform us objects do\r\nsometimes appear, in the arctic regions; and in the manner Scoresby's\r\nship appeared in the sky, with every particular about her so accurately\r\nrepresented, as to be at once identified by the observers, though the\r\nvessel, at that time, was at such a distance as to render it rather\r\nincredible how she could be seen at all. As proof of this position,\r\nCaptain Symmes alleges, that the relative position, shape, and\r\nproportions of these clouds, agree in their general outlines with the\r\nsouthern part of New-Zealand, the southeast part of New-Holland, and\r\nthe whole of Van-Dieman's land, which are situated on, and near to the\r\nverge of the sphere, opposite to where the clouds are visible. These\r\nclouds are only seen in the night when the atmosphere is clear, at\r\nwhich time the sun is shining on the islands in question. Hence it is\r\nalleged, that from these facts, their relative appearance is deducible.\r\nAs we are never sensible that the rays of light are refracted by the\r\nmedium through which they pass before they reach our visual organs; we\r\nfrequently imagine objects to be situated where they really are not;\r\nand such is believed to be the case as respects Van-Dieman's and the\r\ncircumjacent land, as before described.\r\n\r\nFranklin, in his journey far north, on the continent of America,\r\ndiscovered a cloud, which appeared to remain always in the same\r\nposition, and which the Indians informed him was permanent. Not having\r\nthe book at hand, I cannot now advert particularly to what he says on\r\nthe subject: but, from memory only, recollect that he states something\r\nto that effect. If such an appearance exist there, may it not be\r\naccounted for in the same manner as the Magellanic clouds?\r\n\r\nNavigators, who have sailed far north, admit the variation of the\r\nneedle to be excessive. Captain Ross found it in Baffin's Bay, to be\r\nas much as one hundred and ten degrees; and Parry, during his voyage\r\nin 1822, found it so changed, that the needle pointed within about\r\nfourteen degrees of south. All, I believe, concur, that this is a\r\nphenomenon which universally occurs in high northern latitudes; but\r\nit has hitherto remained unexplained. I believe, according to the old\r\ntheory, the needle is imagined to be attracted by something at or near\r\nthe pole: were this supposition correct, the needle would uniformly\r\nmaintain its polarity on proceeding north, on any given meridian,\r\nuntil you arrived at the very pole itself. The possibility of a moving\r\nmagnetic cause is difficult, if not impossible, to be reconciled\r\nwith a solid globe; yet that the magnetic needle does vary on the\r\nsame meridian, and to a most extraordinary degree, in high northern\r\nlatitudes, is confirmed beyond all doubt. Why not then urge the\r\nvariableness of the magnetic cause against the possibility of a solid\r\nglobe?\r\n\r\nAccording to the doctrine of hollow spheres, this whole mystery, of\r\nthe variation of the compass, can be satisfactorily explained. The\r\nmagnetic needle, it is believed, regards the centre of the polar\r\nopening, and not the pole or axis of the earth. It will be recollected,\r\nthat the axis of the earth, being at an angle of twelve or fifteen\r\ndegrees from the plane of the polar openings, causes one part of the\r\nverge to extend farther north than the other, the highest part of which\r\nis nearly on a meridian running through Spitzbergen, in about latitude\r\nsixty-eight degrees, and the lowermost side in about the fiftieth\r\ndegree. Now in proceeding north on the first meridian, running near\r\nSpitzbergen, there ought to be no variation of the needle until you\r\narrive at the apparent verge, when the needle would cease to traverse;\r\nand by proceeding onwards, would turn and point south. Should you\r\nproceed north, on a meridian west of this, when you approached the\r\napparent verge, the needle would seem to turn west, but in reality,\r\nit would be the meridian turning to the right along the verge to\r\nits highest or most northerly point; the needle keeping at a right\r\nangle with the verge. And, in like manner, pursuing a course north,\r\non a meridian east of Spitzbergen, on your approach to the apparent\r\nverge, the needle would still direct its course at a right angle\r\ninto the polar opening, (governed, most probably, by some principle\r\nof electricity, or other property contained in matter, and kept in\r\none position, subject to the shape of the earth, which may not even\r\nyet be exactly known,) the meridian would here wind to the left, and\r\nconduct you to the highest point of the apparent verge, north of\r\nSpitzbergen. Hence the variation of the needle would be east in Asia,\r\nand west in America, which I am told is the fact. From an examination\r\nof the variation of the compass, as ascertained in different degrees\r\nof latitude and longitude, it increases as you proceed north, and\r\nwest; which would be exactly the case in accordance with the theory of\r\nconcentric spheres.[29]\r\n\r\nAdmitting the earth to be a solid globe, and the cause of magnetism\r\nto be some attractive power at the pole, how could the needle vary\r\ndifferently on the same meridian, in different latitudes, at the\r\nsame period of time, or vary at the same place, at different periods\r\nof time? But, admit the doctrine contended for, by the advocates\r\nof concentric spheres, and it can be satisfactorily explained. The\r\nobservations of modern astronomers, have ascertained, that the poles,\r\nor axis of the earth, are not always directed to the same fixed star;\r\nand, of consequence, that the axis does not always remain parallel to\r\nitself. This variation is discovered to be about fifty-one minutes\r\nannually; which would make a degree in about seventy-one years: hence\r\nthe needle always pointing to the polar opening, would vary in about\r\nthat proportion, at the same place, in the same period of time.[30]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] Hearne's Journal, pp. 357, 368.\r\n\r\n[7] Hearne's Journal, pp. 364, 365.\r\n\r\n[8] Hearne's Journal, p. 442.\r\n\r\n[9] Hearne's Journal, p. 442, 443, 444, 445, 446.\r\n\r\n[10] Ibid, p. 445.\r\n\r\n[11] Barrington and Beaufoy, pp. 21, 51.\r\n\r\n[12] Ibid, pp. 25, 61.\r\n\r\n[13] Ibid, pp 25, 32, 37, 61.\r\n\r\n[14] _From the National Intelligencer of Sept. 30, 1824._\r\n\r\n\"POLAR SEAS.――The fact that there are open seas round both the earth's\r\npoles, has received strong corroboration within the last few months.\r\nWe have now a letter on our table from a naval officer at Drontheim,\r\nwho notices the fact that Captain Sabine had good weather, and\r\nreached eighty degrees and thirty-one minutes north latitude, without\r\nobstruction from the ice; so that the expedition might easily have\r\nproceeded farther had its object so required. We have also had the\r\npleasure to meet recently with a British officer who, with two vessels\r\nunder his command, last season penetrated to seventy-four degrees\r\ntwenty-five minutes south latitude, in the antarctic circle, which is\r\nabout three degrees beyond Cook's utmost limit. There he found the sea\r\nperfectly clear of ice, and might have prosecuted his voyage towards\r\nthe pole, if other considerations had permitted. There was no field ice\r\nin sight towards the south; and the water was inhabited by many finned\r\nand hump-backed whales; the longitude was between the south Shetland\r\nIslands, lately discovered, and Sandwich land: this proves the former\r\nto be an Archipelago (as was supposed) and not a continent.

This fluid is lighter than that in which the sphere floats;\r\nand has a tendency to poise it in universal space. The spheres, in many\r\nparts of the unfathomable ocean, is believed to be water quite through\r\nfrom the concave or convex surfaces to the great mid-plane-space, and\r\nprobably the earthy or solid matter of the sphere, may in many places\r\nextend quite through from one surface to the other, tending, like ribs\r\nor braces, to support the sphere in its proper form. Such a formation\r\nof spheres appears to be supported by various facts and phenomena;\r\namongst the most prominent of which are Volcanoes and Earthquakes. Many\r\nvolcanic mountains burst out and burn for ages, discharging from the\r\nbowels of the earth immense quantities of lava, pumice, and various\r\nsubstances of various kinds. Some of these mountains have been burning\r\nfor thousands of years, at least as far back as the records of history\r\nhave been made known to us.\r\n\r\nHad the earth, at its formation, been a solid globe, four times as hard\r\nas hammered iron at the centre, and gradually lessening in density\r\ntowards the surface, we must admit that it would still be solid matter.\r\nGoverning ourselves by these principles, how can we imagine that such\r\nimmense caverns, filled with combustible matter, as would be necessary\r\nto supply those volcanoes from time immemorial, could have existed?\r\nHowever, that they do exist is certain, which I think is in no way\r\nmore easily accounted for, than on the plan of a _mid-plane-space_,\r\nor of spaces, filled with a certain hydrogenous gas, which being much\r\nlighter than atmospheric air, if there should be any small aperture or\r\ncrevice extending from the surface to the space beneath, the gravity of\r\nthe outer part of the sphere pressing on it would occasion a portion\r\nof this gas to escape through the aperture; and as it comes in contact\r\nwith the oxygen of the atmosphere would take fire and occasion those\r\ntremendous explosions which we know do sometimes take place and cause\r\nthose mountains to burn for years, until the cavity which supplied the\r\nvolcanic matter, becomes exhausted; or until some shock or convulsion\r\nconsequent on the burning, may have loosened rocks or earth of the\r\ndenser part of the sphere, which falling into the aperture, choke it\r\nup. Hence the gas ceasing to escape, the volcano would cease to burn,\r\nuntil some shock or accident should again open the aperture.\r\n\r\nThe elastic fluid, with which the _mid-plane_ cavities are filled,\r\nbeing forced out into the common atmosphere, the greater degree of\r\ngravity would condense and set free its latent heat or caloric, and be\r\nresolved into its original base, somewhat as coal-gas, out of the tube\r\nof a gas-light apparatus, yields up its latent heat by condensation.\r\nHence steam burns when mixed with coal-gas.\r\n\r\nIf the earth be a solid globe, I am at a loss to account for the\r\nprinciples on which earthquakes occur. Long before I heard of Symmes's\r\ntheory, or perhaps before it had an existence in the mind of man,\r\nwhen reading accounts of earthquakes, it appeared to me altogether\r\nunaccountable, that such violent concussions could take place in one\r\npart of the world, and not be felt throughout the globe. It appears\r\naltogether inconsistent, that one part of a solid piece of matter,\r\nwould be shaken so violently, without affecting the whole mass. We are\r\ninformed by authentic history, that whole islands, and vast sections\r\nof country, have been sunk by earthquakes, and never more heard of. On\r\nthe other hand, islands which are now inhabited, and productive, have\r\nbeen raised, apparently, from the bottom of the unfathomable ocean.\r\nHow such things occur, I am unable to divine. If the globe be solid,\r\non what principle could a large portion of its surface, which is said\r\nto be lighter than the parts beneath, sink into a dense medium? How\r\ncould a heavy mass, lying a thousand fathoms deep at the bottom of the\r\nocean, rise, and be suddenly elevated above the surface of the water,\r\nwhen all below is so compact, and governed by an opposite and immutable\r\ntendency? It appears to be a solecism in nature.\r\n\r\nThe writer had once an opportunity of witnessing some of the effects\r\nof earthquakes. It was his fortune to be on the Mississippi river\r\nin the year 1812, at the time when that country was so violently\r\nconvulsed with an earthquake. He saw and heard innumerable explosions,\r\nas though a large quantity of air had been confined in the bowels of\r\nthe earth, and, seeking vent, rushed out with a tremendous sound;\r\nforcing up considerable quantities of sand through the apertures, in\r\nmany instances mixed with black muddy water, and a substance resembling\r\nstone coal, or carbonated wood, which emitted a strong bituminous\r\nodour, when exposed to fire.\r\n\r\nAt one place the river was stopped in its course a short time: the\r\nwater rose to a considerable height above its common level; and, on\r\nthe west side of the channel of the river, there was a counter-current\r\nfor a few minutes of an astonishing velocity. So great was its force,\r\nthat for some distance the cotton wood and willows on the margin of the\r\nriver, were either prostrated or bent up the stream; and their branches\r\nlooked as if they had been dragged a long way on the ground. The waters\r\nof the river soon subsided, and flowed in their natural direction.\r\n\r\nSo tremendous were those explosions, that when happening under large\r\ntrees, the tenacity of their texture yielded at once to their force;\r\nand the largest in the forest were split and fractured from root\r\nto top. During these convulsions, the ground on which the town of\r\nNew-Madrid is situated, together with the country for several miles\r\nround, sunk about five feet below its former elevation; in which\r\nsituation it has remained. Eight years afterwards the writer was again\r\non the same spot. The desolate aspect, which the country presented at\r\nthe time he witnessed those scenes, was measurably obliterated: but the\r\nbanks of the river were still in their sunken situation.\r\n\r\nHow could all those violent convulsions take place at this point, and\r\nnot be felt at New-Orleans, along the sea coast of the United States,\r\nand other places? Whence came this water and air, which issued from\r\nthose apertures in the earth? And why did the river for a few minutes\r\nflow in a contrary direction, and then resume its natural course? If\r\nthe earth be a compact and solid globe, I can account for none of\r\nthese things; but admitting the formation of the sphere to be such as\r\nI contend for, they are all resolved into the most simple principles;\r\nand what would otherwise be impenetrable mystery, is made as plain\r\nas noon-day. If the sphere be formed as I allege, those concussions\r\nwere doubtless occasioned by the gas or fluid in the _mid-plane_ or\r\nsome intermediate space, near the surface, which, by being suddenly\r\nrarified, would make it expand, and cause the upper part of the sphere\r\nto be suddenly elevated in the neighbourhood of the Little Prairie;\r\nand hence the waters of the river, pursuing the laws of gravity, would\r\nflow in a contrary direction. This sudden expansion, and elevation of\r\nthe surface, would cause apertures, through which the rare gas would\r\nescape, and the surface would then settle down again, not only to its\r\nformer level, but, as a considerable portion of this gas had escaped,\r\nthe remaining part would occupy less space; hence the surface of the\r\ncountry, around New-Madrid, would be below its former situation.[31]\r\n\r\nThe fluid, or gas, which fills the mid-plane and intermediate cavities,\r\nis most probably the same, or partaking of the same nature, (though\r\nperhaps in a purer state,) with that which oozes out of fissures\r\nin the earth, at the bottom of deep mines, called by chemists,\r\n_hydro-carbonate_; which being highly inflammable, takes fire from the\r\nlamps used by workmen, and explodes with such violence as to destroy\r\nboth men and horses employed in the mine. This is a frequent occurrence\r\nin the deep coal mines of England; and great numbers annually have lost\r\ntheir lives in this way, before the introduction of Sir Humphrey Davy's\r\nlamp. I am also informed, from good authority, that the miners, in some\r\nof the deep coal mines in England, once felt, or heard an earthquake,\r\nwhich happened in Italy, whilst those on the surface of the ground had\r\nno knowledge of it. This would be the case, if the intermediate cavity,\r\nwhich caused the earthquake, extended in that direction, and near the\r\nbottom of the mine; as it is presumed the rare gas with which those\r\nspaces are filled, is better adapted to the conveyance of sound, or\r\nvibratory motion, than the more solid parts of the sphere, or even the\r\natmosphere around us.\r\n\r\nOn the supposition that the globe is solid, and the matter composing\r\nit at rest, as respects itself, on what principle can boiling and hot\r\nsprings be accounted for; some of which issue out several thousands\r\nof miles distant from where any volcano or subterranean fire is known\r\nto exist; particularly as to those on the waters of Red river, in the\r\nstate of Louisiana, which are sufficiently hot to cook meat in a few\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nPhenomena which occur in various lakes in Europe, may be adverted to in\r\nsupport of this theory. The waters of lake Zirchnitzer, in the Dutchy\r\nof Carniola, in Germany, flow off, and leave the basin empty; and again\r\nfill it, in an extraordinary and impetuous manner; bringing up with\r\nits waters fish and even sometimes wild water fowl.[32] In the same\r\ncountry, there is a subterranean lake, in the Grotto Podspetschio, of\r\nconsiderable extent; the whole of this vast body of water, at certain\r\ntimes, will disappear in a few minutes, and leave the basin dry; and\r\nafter a few weeks, it again suddenly returns, with a frightful noise.\r\nThe lake of Geneva, and some others in Switzerland, at certain times\r\nrise and fall several feet without any cause, which has as yet been\r\nsatisfactorily explained; and some writers inform us, that those lakes,\r\nparticularly Geneva, send forth, at times, a grumbling noise. In the\r\nSaian mountains, near the source of the Yenisei, is a lake, called\r\nBoulamy-Koul, which, at the approach of winter, emits strange sounds,\r\nsomewhat similar to those which precede the eruption of a volcano, and\r\nwhich are compared by the neighbouring inhabitants to howling. The\r\ninhabitants on the borders of Baikal, also state, that they have often\r\nheard dreadful and terrific howlings proceed from that lake.[33] The\r\nlake, Agnano, in Italy, sometimes, especially when the waters are\r\nhigh, appears to boil at its borders. This ebullition is supposed to be\r\noccasioned by some gaseous fluids, discharged into the bottom, which\r\ntraverse the waters of the lake.[34] These various phenomena, which\r\ncannot be easily accounted for, might be best explained perhaps, on the\r\nprinciples of _mid-plane-spaces_. In various parts of the north, thick\r\nstrata of ice are found, under a thick soil; and on ice-bergs, floating\r\nin the ocean, have been discovered masses of earth, of granite, and of\r\nother rocks.[35]\r\n\r\nOn the shores of Greenland the ebb tide flows towards the coast,\r\napparently as though it passes under the land, and the flood tide\r\nrecedes from the shore; and in those regions the sea is almost\r\nuniversally found deeper as you approach the shore.[36] When the\r\nwhales become scarce, experience has taught the whalers to seek for\r\nthem near the shore, as if at certain seasons they retired to it,\r\nand then disappeared. Captain Symmes imagines that the sea extends\r\nquite through the spheres, about Greenland, and that the whales\r\nsuddenly migrate either to the _mid-plane-space_, or to the seas\r\non the opposite side; which he alleges to be the case with several\r\nother species of fish, as well as seals; all of which, he supposes,\r\nbreed in the _mid-plane-space_. The reasons that induce him to adopt\r\nthis conclusion are various; such as, that fish have been thrown up\r\nby the eruption of a volcano in South America[37]――herring appearing\r\nin such immense numbers at certain seasons of the year――the whales\r\nseeming to pass under Greenland――two seals having been once caught in\r\nLake Ontario, which is said to be unfathomable, although this lake\r\nis many degrees south of where the seals have ever before been known\r\nto come――and the various species of fish in our northern lakes which\r\nappear and disappear at certain periods. That the exterior seas in\r\nsome places communicate with the interior seas, is rendered probable\r\nby various other circumces; such as currents running continually into\r\nthe Mediterranean, and no visible outlet to the water thus continually\r\nflowing in. It is scarcely probable that evaporation could carry off\r\nall the water supplied by the straits of Gibraltar――the white sea being\r\nmore salt at the head than at the foot――the tides being higher in the\r\nBaltic than the Mediterranean――white foxes having been forced up by\r\nthe waters of the sea (as Symmes undertakes to prove) in the northern\r\nregions――the peculiarities of the tremendous whirlpool on the coast\r\nof Norway, called the Maalstroom, which sucks in, and discharges the\r\nwaters of the sea with great violence――and those observable in the Bay\r\nof Biscay, which are said to be unfathomable.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[31] EARTHQUAKES.――M. Biot, after detailing the phenomena of the\r\nearthquake, on the 22d of February, 1822, concludes an interesting\r\npaper with these observations:――\r\n\r\nIn the infancy of Chemistry and Natural Philosophy, it was imagined\r\nthat earthquakes might be easily explained; in proportion as these\r\nsciences have become more correct and more profound, this confidence\r\nhas decreased. But by a propensity, for which the character of the\r\nhuman mind sufficiently accounts, all the new physical agents which\r\nhave been successively discovered, such as electricity, magnetism,\r\nthe inflammation of gases, the decomposition and recomposition of\r\nwater, have been maintained in theories as the causes of the great\r\nphenomena of nature. Now all these conjectures seem to be insufficient\r\nto explain convulsions so extensive, produced at the same time over\r\nsuch large portions of the earth, as those which take place during\r\nearthquakes. The most probable opinion, the only one which seems to\r\nus to reconcile, in a certain degree, the energy, the extent of these\r\nphenomena, and often their frightful correspondence in the most distant\r\ncountries of the globe, would be to suppose, conformably to many other\r\nphysical indications, that the solid surface on which we live is but of\r\ninconsiderable thickness in comparison with the semi-diameter of the\r\nterrestrial globe; is in some measure only a recent shell, covering\r\na liquid nucleus, perhaps still in a state of ignition, in which\r\ngreat chemical or physical phenomena operating at intervals cause\r\nthose agitations which are transmitted to us. The countries where the\r\nsuperficial crust is less thick or less strong, or more recently or\r\nmore imperfectly consolidated, would agreeably to this hypothesis, be\r\nthose the most liable to be convulsed and broken by the violence of\r\nthese internal explosions. Now if we compare together the experiments\r\non the length of the pendulum, which have been made for some years past\r\nwith great accuracy, from the north of Scotland to the south of Spain,\r\nwe readily perceive that the intensity of gravitation decreases on this\r\nspace, as we go from the Pole towards the Equator, more rapidly than\r\nit ought to do upon an ellipsoid, the concentric and similar strata of\r\nwhich should have equal densities at equal depths; and the deviation\r\nis especially sensible about the middle of France, where too there has\r\nbeen observed a striking irregularity in the length of the degrees of\r\nthe earth. This local decrease of gravity in these countries should\r\nseem to indicate, with some probability, that the strata near the\r\nsurface must be less dense there than elsewhere, and perhaps have in\r\ntheir interior immense cavities. This would account for the existence\r\nof the numerous volcanos of which these strata show the traces, and\r\nexplain why they are even now, at intervals, the focus of subterraneous\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\n[32] Cook's Geography, v. 2, p. 250――Also Rees' Cyclopedia, article\r\nLake.\r\n\r\n[33] Rees' Cyclopedia, article Lake Geneva.\r\n\r\n[34] Rees' Cyclopedia, article Lake.\r\n\r\n[35] Ross' Voyage, v. 1, p. 225.\r\n\r\n[36] Ibid, v. 1, p. 144.\r\n\r\n[37] Humboldt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n _Several objections, made to the Theory of Concentric Spheres,\r\n answered, particularly the one that it contravenes religious opinions;\r\n demonstrating that the earth, and the other orbs of the universe, are\r\n formed on the best possible plan for the maintenance and support of\r\n organic life._\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the most prominent objections which I have heard advanced\r\nagainst the theory of concentric spheres are the following:\r\n\r\n1st. That if the earth be not a solid globe, but a hollow concentric\r\nsphere, the quantity of matter being diminished, the attraction of\r\ngravitation must be lessened so much that all moveable bodies resting\r\non the earth would be thrown off by centrifugal force, in the line of a\r\ntangent from the surface of the sphere.\r\n\r\n2d. That according to the established laws of gravity, a hollow sphere\r\ncould not exist in nature: that matter would be gravitated to the\r\ncentre, and particularly about the polar openings, so as to make it\r\ncollapse.\r\n\r\n3d. That if the orbs were hollow spheres, the mutual influence of the\r\nplanets on each other would be so far destroyed, that they would cease\r\nto revolve in regular orbits.\r\n\r\n4th. That the interior of the sphere can never receive the light and\r\nheat of the sun; is involved in perpetual darkness, and more suited to\r\nthe infliction of punishment on perverse and rebellious spirits, than\r\nfor the residence of beings, fitted and designed for the pursuit and\r\nenjoyment of happiness.\r\n\r\n5th. And finally, the adherents of the new theory have been charged\r\nwith atheism, deism, and such like epithets, as though they intended to\r\noverturn the works of God, and thwart the laws of nature.\r\n\r\n1st. As to the first objection, I would enquire, has it yet been\r\nascertained with mathematical certainty, in what exact proportion one\r\nparticle of matter attracts another? And may there not be some law of\r\nnature with which we are not yet well acquainted? All the experiments,\r\nhitherto made on the attractive power of gravity, were made on the\r\nprinciple, and under the belief, that the earth is a solid globe;\r\nand consequently the deductions were drawn accordingly. Suppose the\r\nattraction of gravitation, inherent in matter, to be so much increased,\r\nthat a hollow sphere would possess the same attractive power, as if\r\nit were a solid globe, would not all the results and consequences be\r\nexactly the same? This being the case,――and I know no reason why we\r\nshould conclude differently,――the whole force of the objection appears\r\nto fall to the ground. According to Newton's principle of gravity,\r\nthe matter of the sphere would attract all particles of matter placed\r\non the surface, as well upon the concave as convex, in nearly equal\r\nproportions; and the centrifugal force, which, on the outer side of\r\nthe sphere, tends to throw bodies off, on the concave side, would have\r\nan opposite effect. Hence, a person standing, or trees growing, on the\r\ninterior surface, would be in no more danger of being precipitated to\r\nthe next sphere, between them and the centre, than those on the outer\r\npart of the sphere, when they should be _turned_ (what is familiarly\r\ncalled) _down_.\r\n\r\nThe experiments made on the density of the globe, by observations with\r\nthe plum-line, at the foot of a mountain, are very ingenious; but\r\nthey must be subject to great uncertainty. The true deviation of the\r\nplum-line, the exact quantity of matter in the mountain, or, indeed,\r\nthe quantity of matter between the plummet and the centre of gravity,\r\nare points difficult, if not impossible, to be ascertained with\r\nmathematical precision.\r\n\r\nIf the attraction of the sun is just sufficient to keep the earth in\r\nits orbit, what can give the tendency to retain Jupiter and Saturn in\r\ntheirs, each of which, if solid, contains such a vast quantity more\r\nthan the earth, and removed to so great a distance from the sun, that\r\nhis influence upon either must be greatly lessened by both?\r\n\r\n2d. As to the objections that a hollow sphere of the dimension of the\r\nearth cannot exist in nature, I can discover no sound reason to warrant\r\nsuch a conclusion. Many hollow cylinders and spherical figures, we know\r\ndo exist on the surface of the earth; and notwithstanding their own\r\ngravity, which the different parts exert on each other, as well as the\r\ngravity of the earth, they retain their shape and position; and had the\r\nmatter in the earth originally been thrown by a centrifugal force into\r\nthe form of a hollow sphere, or had the first creating power originally\r\ngiven it that shape,――I can discover no good reason for a change;\r\nneither should I entertain any apprehensions of the particles of matter\r\ncoalescing at the centre.\r\n\r\n3d. The force of this objection I cannot appreciate; for if all the\r\nplanetary orbs in the universe are composed of hollow concentric\r\nspheres, they must exert the same relative influence on each other,\r\nwhich they would if they were solid orbs, as they would each contain\r\nthe same proportion of matter as respects each other. Hence no good\r\nreason appears why a system of hollow concentric spheres might not do\r\njust as well, and perform their revolutions with the same regularity,\r\nas a system of solid ones.\r\n\r\n4th. This great and alarming objection comes next:――that we are about\r\nplacing a world in eternal darkness, cut off from all the comforts\r\nand pleasures of refined life, for the enjoyment of which we are so\r\neminently qualified. Let us examine the force of this objection; and\r\nif we cannot show that the interior is, at least in some degree,\r\nilluminated, we must then conclude that it is a very dreary abode, and\r\nunfitted for the residence of beings so fond of light as we _profess to\r\nbe_.\r\n\r\nAccording to the new theory, the northern polar opening is about four\r\nthousand one hundred and fifty miles in diameter, and the axis of the\r\nearth is at an angle of about twelve degrees with the axis of the plane\r\nof the polar opening; consequently, as the sphere revolves on its axis,\r\none side of the verge of the polar opening will extend considerably\r\nfurther north than the other. The verge of the north polar opening on\r\nthe low side, is laid down at about fifty degrees of latitude, and the\r\nverge of the high side at about sixty-eight degrees.\r\n\r\nNow, supposing the sun to be exactly of the same diameter as the earth,\r\nand placed directly over the equator, when the low side of the verge\r\nwas turned towards the sun, the direct rays from his northern limb,\r\nindependent of refraction, would pass the edge of the lower part of the\r\nverge, and fall on the inner part of the sphere, on the concave part of\r\nthe high side opposite, as far as eighteen degrees, or upwards. When\r\nthe sun would be on the tropic of Cancer, in June, he must then throw\r\nthe rays from his centre twenty-three and a half degrees further within\r\nthe sphere, or within twenty-six and a half degrees of the equator;\r\nbut the diameter of the sun being so much greater than the earth, the\r\nrays from his northern limb, would fall about thirty-three minutes\r\nfurther within the sphere, and leave not quite twenty-six degrees\r\nbetween that and the equator to be excluded from his direct rays.\r\nThis relates to the northern polar opening; as to that of the south,\r\nwhich is believed to be much larger, we will make a few remarks.\r\nThe lower side of the south polar opening, is laid in about latitude\r\nthirty-four degrees, and the higher side, in about latitude forty-six\r\ndegrees. Were the sun of the same diameter with the earth, as above\r\npremised, and placed on the equator, his direct rays would be thrown\r\ninto the south polar opening when the low side was towards him, about\r\ntwelve degrees, or to within thirty-four degrees of the equator, and\r\nwhen on the tropic of Capricorn, in December, twenty-three and a half\r\ndegrees further, that is, the inner part of the southern hemisphere\r\nof the sphere, on the high side, would be lighted thirty-five and a\r\nhalf degrees within the verge; and the direct rays of the sun would\r\nshine within ten and a half degrees of the inner centre of the sphere\r\nor equator. These observations, you will observe, are made in the most\r\nunfavourable point of view. It is well known, that the diameter of the\r\nsun, is vastly greater than that of the earth; consequently, his rays\r\nwould pass into the polar opening so much further, in proportion as\r\nthe angle of his diameter, and that of the earth, differ, which would\r\nbe about thirty-three minutes further, bringing his direct rays in the\r\nsouth, within less than ten degrees of the equator; and this would be\r\nthe case as the sphere revolved on its axis, once in every twenty-four\r\nhours. When the sphere turned, with its high side towards the sun, it\r\nwould be night, or twilight, and when the low side was next the sun, it\r\nwould be day; at all events, the direct rays of the sun would fall on a\r\nspace of about thirty-six and a half degrees in breadth; the reflection\r\nfrom which would light the whole of the remaining portion of the inner\r\npart of the sphere, to a greater degree, than any moon-light with which\r\nwe are acquainted. But there is another circumstance which tends to\r\nthrow the rays of the sun much further into the concave than we have\r\nyet got them; that is, the refractive power of the atmosphere. It is\r\na well known fact that the rays of light are very much refracted when\r\npassing out of a rare into a denser medium; and about the poles of the\r\nearth it is believed, (and this belief is confirmed by navigators) that\r\nrefraction increases very considerably, owing to the great density of\r\nthe atmosphere. We have good reason then to believe that refraction\r\nthrows the rays of the sun several degrees further within the sphere.\r\nBut let us take the known refraction of the horizontal ray, at or near\r\nthe equator (say one half of a degree) it would throw the rays of light\r\nso much further into the concave, and not leave quite thirty-seven\r\ndegrees in the centre of the sphere deprived of the sun's rays. The\r\nmotion of the earth causes the apparent motion of the sun to be about\r\nfifteen degrees in an hour, as the diurnal revolution of the earth\r\ncauses the sun to move apparently through three hundred and sixty\r\ndegrees in twenty-four hours. Now it is a well known fact to all that\r\nthe sun gives us light sufficient to be called day-light, for about\r\nan hour after he descends below the horizon; consequently he must\r\nafford us light when he is fifteen degrees obscured from our view.\r\nAccordingly, the sun, though he might not be visible, would illuminate\r\nthe concave part of the sphere fifteen degrees further than his direct\r\nrays fall, which reduces the space in the interior of the sphere to the\r\nbreadth of not quite seven degrees which would still remain unlighted.\r\n\r\nBut this is making calculations on the most unfavorable premises\r\npossible. Considering the form of the earth, and the power of\r\nrefraction, I have no doubt but the direct rays of the sun would fall\r\non every part of the inner sphere. However, I have proceeded on such\r\npremises as, I conclude, the most sceptical must admit. Light, we\r\nknow, is reflected from solid bodies on which it falls, and also from\r\nthe atmosphere: the rays of the sun, then, which would pass the lower\r\npart of the verge and fall on the opposite concave surface, would be\r\nreflected back in all directions, and most probably light the whole\r\nof the interior of the sphere sufficient for the ordinary purposes of\r\nlife. By way of further illustration, suppose a perpendicular wall\r\nwere raised on a plain, one mile high, does any person believe that\r\nthere would be no light on the side of the wall opposite to the sun;\r\nalthough his rays would have to form an angle of one hundred and forty,\r\nor one hundred and fifty degrees, to reach the earth on that side of\r\nthe wall? No axiom is more evident than that the rays of light are\r\ncommunicated to other places than those on which the rays of the sun\r\nfall directly; for example, we all know that a close room, however\r\nlarge, with a north window, will be sufficiently lighted by refraction\r\nand reflection from the atmosphere, provided there is no obstruction\r\nopposite the window, although the rays of the sun would have to form an\r\nangle of one hundred and fifty degrees to enter it, and why might not\r\nthe whole interior of the sphere be lighted in the same manner, even\r\nsupposing the rays of the sun should never enter directly. The north\r\npolar opening being about four thousand one hundred and fifty miles in\r\ndiameter, and the southern six thousand three hundred and fifty, with\r\nthe whole force of the direct rays of the sun falling on and passing\r\nthrough the atmosphere at either polar opening, it would not require\r\nrefraction, or reflection, to make an angle of ninety degrees to light\r\nthe whole of the interior concave; and certainly the polar openings are\r\nsufficiently large for the purpose, when we compare a common window\r\nwith the dimensions of an ordinary sized room.\r\n\r\nIt is believed, by the adherents of the new theory, that the\r\natmosphere, within the concave, and about the polar openings, is much\r\ndenser than our atmosphere; which appears inevitably to be the case,\r\nas the centrifugal force on the convex has the tendency to throw the\r\natmosphere _from_ the surface, and on the concave to force it from\r\nthe centre of motion, and nearer _to_ the surface. This admitted, the\r\nrays of the sun passing out of a rare medium into a denser, would be\r\nrefracted much further into the sphere; and the sun-shine on the\r\nsurface of one sphere would be reflected obliquely, according to the\r\nangle of incidence, to the next sphere, and in this manner might be\r\nextended even beyond the centre of the concave. It is also believed,\r\nthat near the verges of the polar openings, and perhaps in many other\r\nparts of the unfathomable ocean, the spheres are water quite through,\r\n(at least all except the _mid-plane-spaces_, or cavities) which being\r\nthe case, light would probably be transmitted between the spheres.\r\n\r\nThe apparent elevation of celestial bodies above their true altitude,\r\nis greatest when the body is on the horizon, which is ascertained to\r\nbe a little more than half a degree; hence, in our climate, the sun\r\nappears three minutes sooner, and sets three minutes later than is\r\nreally the case, which increases the length of our day six minutes, by\r\nrefraction. This gradually increases in proceeding from the equator\r\nto the frigid zones; and at the poles, were the earth entire, the\r\nday should become thirty-six hours longer, by refraction alone, than\r\nit would otherwise be.[38] It was doubtless owing to some peculiar\r\nrefractive power in the northern regions, that caused the Dutch, who\r\nwintered on Nova-Zembla, (which is in latitude between seventy and\r\nseventy-eight degrees,) on the approach of summer, to see the sun\r\nabout two weeks sooner than he should have appeared in that latitude,\r\naccording to astronomical calculation.[39] This tends to show that\r\nthere is more refraction in the northern regions than is observable in\r\nthe south.[40]\r\n\r\nFrom an attentive examination of these considerations, I am induced to\r\nconclude, that the interior of the sphere may be as well lighted as the\r\nexterior; or at all events, if not favoured with so great a degree of\r\nlight at all times, it has a more regular and constant supply. But,\r\nadmitting every thing on this subject that the opponents of the theory\r\ncan suggest, I still discover no substantial reason why the earth\r\nmay not be a hollow sphere. I can see no substantial reason why the\r\ninhabitants of that portion of the earth, (if any exist there) should\r\nbe furnished with as great a degree of light, and as intense a heat,\r\nas we have upon the convex part of the sphere. Must it of necessity\r\nfollow, that it cannot be inhabited, or if inhabited, that the beings\r\nwho people its surface, are less happy than we? Certainly not. Is\r\nit not well known to us, that every grade and species of animals,\r\nunder every variety of circumstance, whether inhabiting the air, the\r\nearth, or the water, are fitted by an all-wise Providence to their\r\nseveral conditions, and mediums, in which they reside? As well might\r\nwe conclude, that the immense planet Jupiter, situated so far from\r\nthe sun as he is, can be nothing but a dark, cold, and barren waste,\r\nunfitted for the residence of intelligent beings. It is ascertained\r\nby calculation, that the light and heat which Jupiter receives from\r\nthe sun, is only the one twenty-seventh part of what the earth\r\nreceives.[41] The light and heat which Saturn receives from the sun\r\nis estimated at only the one hundredth part of that of the earth;[42]\r\nand the planet Georgium Sidus, revolving such an immense distance\r\nfurther from the sun, than either of them, must enjoy still less light\r\nand heat; according to which, we would conclude, (if we adopt the\r\nbelief, that the degree of light and heat, to which we are accustomed,\r\nis necessary for the support of life,) that those vast planets are\r\nnot fitted by the God of nature for the residence of intelligent\r\nbeings; however, I am inclined to believe that both light and heat are\r\ncommunicated to them, in some way not well known to us, sufficient for\r\nthe purpose. The true principles of light and heat, and the manner in\r\nwhich they are generated and transmitted, are not perhaps yet well\r\nunderstood and defined.[43]\r\n\r\n5th. Others, when the new theory is mentioned, cry Atheist, Deist,\r\nblasphemy! as if its advocates proposed to make a new world, and\r\nsupport it without the intervention of Divine Providence: such\r\nopponents scarcely deserve an answer. It is believed by all, that\r\nthe earth, the sun, the moon and stars, are the work of an Almighty\r\npower. Whether solid globes or hollow spheres, they equally owe\r\ntheir existence to the great first cause, that spoke matter into\r\nexistence, that arranged it in whatever form and order infinite\r\nwisdom dictated; and that still supports and governs the whole by\r\nuniversal and unvarying laws. But it is as well known, that the\r\nAlmighty Disposer, interposes no miracles for the accomplishment of his\r\ndesigns, but makes use of means that are uniform in their application,\r\nto effect the intended purpose; hence Geologists, Philosophers, and\r\nAstronomers, attempt to account for the existence of all matter, and\r\nfor the formation of planets, according to what is believed to be the\r\nestablished laws of matter. In so doing, we do not disparage the wisdom\r\nof the Creator, nor controvert the truth of that divine record, which\r\nProvidence, in his goodness, has given us for our rule of life. True it\r\nis, the sacred scriptures give us very little information relative to\r\nthe structure and formation of the earth and the other planets. They\r\nwere not intended to teach mankind Geology, Geography, or Astronomy;\r\nyet where assertions are clearly and distinctly made respecting\r\nthese things, we have reason to believe them literally correct: as\r\nfor instance, when the Psalmist informs us, that God hung the earth\r\nupon nothing; that He balanced it in empty space, we are to look for\r\ncorresponding facts; though it was at variance with the opinion of\r\nthe world at that time, modern astronomy now teaches that such is the\r\nfact. In like manner, when we meet with assertions, such as that \"the\r\nfountains of the great deep were broken up,\" (והארץ היתה תהו ובהו,\r\nchapter 1, verse 2,[44]) we must acknowledge their correctness; and I\r\nthink it will be admitted, that they are at least as much in favour of\r\nthis new theory as the old.\r\n\r\nThe skilful and attentive observer of nature, whether examining the\r\nmost minute or the most sublime, will discover that infinite wisdom,\r\njudgment, and ingenuity, equally prevail throughout. The principal\r\naims of the great author of all things, appear to have been animation,\r\ndiversity, and usefulness; the air we breathe, the water we drink, the\r\nvegetables on which we feed; indeed every leaf and plant of the forest\r\nand field――all teem with animal life. Why then should we believe, or\r\neven presume to think, that the Almighty Fiat, which spoke matter\r\ninto existence, for the support and maintenance of living creatures,\r\ninnumerable, and endless in the variety of their organization, their\r\ncolours, their passions, and their pursuits――why, I say, should we\r\nthen presume, that the omnifick word would create even the smallest\r\nparticle of any of the immense, the innumerable orbs in the universe,\r\nof inert or useless matter, devoid of activity and design? This earth,\r\nwhen compared with the magnitude and number of other planets we know,\r\nis but as a point; yet we can hardly conceive, small as she appears\r\nby comparison, that she was only designed to have animate life on\r\nher surface, and all the rest to remain useless! Such an idea seems\r\nunworthy of the Divine Being, whose essence is all perfection. Can\r\nwe for a moment suppose, that the interior parts of the earth, have\r\nreceived less attention from the Creator, than the objects which are\r\nunder our immediate inspection? On the contrary, may it not be more\r\nrationally inferred, that, for the object of more widely disseminating\r\nanimation, spheres are formed within spheres, concentric with each\r\nother, each revolving on its own axis, and thus multiplying the\r\nhabitable superfices?\r\n\r\nGreat and sublime as our conceptions of the Deity must be, when we\r\ncontemplate the earth and its inhabitants――if we turn our attention\r\nto the solar system, our world dwindles into a little insignificant\r\nball. Yet if we cast our eyes still beyond, and contemplate the eighty\r\nmillions of fixed stars, which a good telescope brings to our view,\r\neach the centre of a mighty system of revolving worlds; and then\r\nreflect that all this is only one little dark corner of creation, we\r\nare lost in the magnitude of the contemplation. But when we come to\r\nconsider each of these fixed stars, with their planets, and they with\r\ntheir satellites, all consisting of concentric spheres, revolving\r\nwithin each other, in due order, and adapted to the support and\r\ncomforts of life, for countless millions of beings; we are struck with\r\nten-fold astonishment and admiration, and bow with reverential awe,\r\nbefore Him who sits at the head of the universe, and governs the whole\r\nby unvarying laws. It would seem to me, that in contemplating this new\r\norder of creation, the imagination must break through and soar beyond\r\nits old boundaries. It would seem that on embracing this doctrine, the\r\nspirit must expand with increased devotion, and be entirely absorbed in\r\nthe infinite wisdom and power of Him, who was competent to devise, and\r\nable to execute, such a beautiful arrangement of matter.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[38] Physical World, p. 105.\r\n\r\n[39] Barrington and Beaufoy, p. 106, and Purchas, v. 3, pp. 499, 500.\r\n\r\n[40] The late George Adams, in his Philosophy, treating of refraction,\r\nstates, that \"at the horizon, in this climate, (England) it is found\r\nto be about thirty-three minutes.

The light and heat communicated to Saturn, being\r\nonly the one hundredth part of that of the earth, the difference is\r\nmore than seven times as great as that between our summer heat and\r\nred hot iron, if the light and heat of the sun are only in proportion\r\nto the density of his rays. Such extremes of heat and cold, we would\r\nnaturally conclude must totally preclude all material being, if in the\r\nleast degree resembling those we are acquainted with; nor could any of\r\nthe vegetable world, known to us, germinate in either extreme; nay,\r\neven the matter of our globe would scarcely withstand it, our oceans\r\nwould be dissipated in vapour, on Mercury, and frozen to the bottom\r\non Saturn. Considerations like these must induce us to conclude, that\r\nlight and heat cannot be communicated exactly on the plan laid down\r\nby Newton, viz: that the heat of the sun is simply as the density of\r\nhis rays: for though the sun's rays may be the _sine qua non_, without\r\nwhich no light or heat would be communicated, yet the _quantum_ of heat\r\nmay depend on the density and co-operation of the medium through which\r\nit passes, or upon some other circumstance not known to us, and perhaps\r\nimpossible for us to know.\r\n\r\n[44] I am indebted to an excellent Hebrew scholar for the following:\r\n\r\nNOTE. The words תהו ובהו _Theoo_ and _Beoo_, (Genesis, chapter 1,\r\nverse 2,) which has been rendered by the translators of our bible,\r\n\"Without form and void,\" might perhaps, with equal propriety, have been\r\ntranslated \"without form and hollow.\"\r\n\r\n1. _Theoo_, the root, agreeably to the Hebrew grammar, is found as a\r\nnoun תה or תהה _The_ or _Thee_, and, is rendered _confusion_, loose,\r\nunconnected, without form, order, or the like; and so well understood.\r\n\r\n2. _Be-oo_, the root, is, according to the same rule, found in\r\nבה――_Be_, (_Bethhey_) _hollow_; it occurs not only in this form but――\r\n\r\n1. As a noun בהו Beoo――Hollow, empty, having nothing in it but air,\r\nfilled only _vacuo aere_, with empty air, as Lucan calls it, Lib. 5,\r\nline 94.\r\n\r\n2.

See Parkhurst's Hebrew Lexicon.\r\n\r\nHad the learned translators of our bible possessed a knowledge of the\r\ntheory of concentric spheres, it is probable they would have given\r\nthe English reader the most correct meaning of the words, תהו ובהו\r\n\"_without form and hollow_,\" or \"_shapeless and hollow_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n _General observations on the Theory of Concentric Spheres, with a few\r\n suggestions to the Congress of the United States, to authorize and fit\r\n out an Expedition for the discovery of the Interior Regions; or, at\r\n least, to explore the northern parts of the continent of America._\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the many various and conflicting theories which have been advanced,\r\nrelative to the form, structure, and motion of the earth, the theory of\r\nConcentric Spheres deserves to rank as one of the most important: for,\r\nshould it hereafter be found correct, the advantages resulting to the\r\ncivilized and learned world, must cause it to stand pre-eminent among\r\nthe improvements in philosophy. The habitable superfices of our sphere\r\nwould not only be nearly doubled; but the different spheres of which\r\nour earth is probably constituted, might increase the habitable surface\r\nten-fold.\r\n\r\nThat such may be the construction of the earth, every law of\r\nmatter with which I am acquainted, seems to admit, at least of the\r\npossibility; the different appearances of the other planets render it\r\nprobable; and the various concurring terrestrial facts existing in the\r\narctic regions, to my mind, render such a conclusion almost certain.\r\nAnd further, that matter and space are never uselessly wasted, is an\r\naxiom, not only of sound philosophy, but of natural religion, and of\r\ncommon sense.\r\n\r\nMany of the theories which have been advanced respecting the earth, are\r\nvague and uncertain, and will remain so forever; being predicated on\r\ndeductions drawn from certain premises that can never be established\r\nwith certainty; consequently they must rest wholly on the strength of\r\nthe arguments drawn from the premises, as they are not susceptible of\r\nbeing demonstrated by experiment. Not so with the theory of concentric\r\nspheres. Its correctness admits of ocular demonstration. The interior\r\nof the sphere is declared accessible, and the whole extent capable\r\nof being accurately explored; thereby establishing the theory, or\r\ndisproving and putting it at rest forever.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Dr. Halley, in the year 1692, in his attempt to account\r\nfor the change of the variation of the magnetic needle, advanced a\r\nnovel hypothesis, as respects the internal structure of the earth. He\r\nsupposes that there is an interior globe, separated from the external\r\nsphere by a fluid medium; or that there may be several internal\r\nspheres, separated from each other by atmospheres, and that the\r\nconcave arches may in several places shine with a substance similar\r\nto that which invests the body of the sun, producing light and heat\r\nfor the accommodation of those internal regions which he alleges may\r\npossibly be inhabited by animate beings.[45]\r\n\r\nHowever, he suggests no idea of Polar Openings, nor of any\r\ncommunication from the outer surface to those interior regions;\r\nconsequently their existence must have remained forever a matter of\r\nmere conjecture.\r\n\r\nWe find that Dr. Halley, in the wisdom of his philosophy, believed\r\nthose internal regions to be lighted, though situated many thousand\r\nfathoms beneath the surface, and without any aperture to communicate\r\nlight from without. Why not, then, believe that the interior of the\r\nspheres, according to Symmes's theory, may be lighted, when he lays\r\ndown such vast openings at either pole for that purpose?\r\n\r\nEuler was also an advocate for the theory of Dr. Halley. He believed,\r\nwith him, that the earth is hollow, with a ball, or nucleus, included\r\nin the centre; he, however, differed from Halley as to the nature of\r\nthe nucleus. Halley believed it to be constituted of the same materials\r\nof the exterior crust of the earth. Euler believed it to be a luminous\r\nbody formed of materials similar to the sun, and adapted to the purpose\r\nof illuminating and warming the interior surface of the crust, which\r\nhe supposed might be inhabited equally with the exterior surface. He\r\nfancied that this luminous ball had no rotary motion, and that the\r\nouter shell revolved around it. However, neither he nor Dr. Halley\r\nleft any opening by which the internal regions could be explored; their\r\nexistence was therefore left to rest on vague hypothesis.[46]\r\n\r\nThese different theories, however extravagant they may appear to us,\r\nwere believed and supported by those men, whom we must acknowledge\r\nwere among the most learned of the age in which they lived; and among\r\nthe mathematicians in Europe they have yet some warm supporters. Why\r\nnot then give Symmes's theory of open poles, and _concentric spheres_,\r\na serious investigation, the correctness of which is so much more\r\nprobable, and the demonstration of its truth or falsehood so much more\r\npracticable? At all events a _voyage to the polar regions_, with an\r\neye to the accomplishment of Symmes's purpose, might be productive\r\nof incalculable advantages to the cause of science in general. With\r\nrespect to astronomy and geography, it would afford many new lights,\r\nand perhaps discover and establish many new principles, not thought of\r\nat this day.\r\n\r\n\"_Knowledge is power_,\" and so far as an individual acquires a\r\nknowledge of literature and science, above his contemporaries, so far\r\ndoes he possess a power and influence over those among whom he resides.\r\nSo does a nation, when she becomes characterized for the acquisition of\r\nknowledge in the sciences and the arts. Those nations which have made\r\ngreat and important advances in the improvement of science, or in new\r\ndiscoveries, have acquired a pre-eminence of character and standing,\r\namong other nations of the world.\r\n\r\nThe United States of America, having assumed a respectable station\r\namong the nations, is fast advancing in wealth and power. Her\r\nterritories are stretched over a vast extent of country; and her\r\npopulation is increasing with a rapidity unprecedented. We are already\r\nlooked up to, by other nations, as a people of very considerable\r\nimportance; and as having made a successful experiment in politics and\r\ngovernment, which politicians had before considered impracticable.\r\nOught we not then, as a nation, (paying some attention to the progress\r\nof science and knowledge,) to hold out inducements for the progressive\r\nimprovements, and useful discoveries of our own citizens?\r\n\r\nWhile the English, the Russians, and the French, are making great\r\nexertions for the purpose of discovery, and the advancement of science;\r\nwill America remain idle and inactive? Will she adopt the unwise policy\r\nthat individual enterprise ought to be let alone? Other nations act\r\ndifferently; and they have long been directing their researches towards\r\nthe acquisition of a more perfect knowledge of our globe: and such\r\nexertions have always been considered as the most glorious actions\r\non record in the annals of their history. By so doing, they have not\r\nonly been amply rewarded themselves, but have benefited the world at\r\nlarge, by the acquisition of important information respecting the\r\nbefore unknown parts of it, and by the improvement of science. Will\r\nAmerica then sit by inactive and contented, while she is surrounded\r\nwith plenty, and enjoying a situation most enviable in the career\r\nof nations? Let us rather encourage than shackle the genius and\r\nenterprising spirit of our own citizens; and not act like an avaricious\r\nmiser, who directs all his thoughts to the calculation of dollars and\r\ncents. Had this \"let alone policy,\" been pursued by the nations that\r\nhave sent out ships of discovery, what would have been the situation of\r\nthe world at the present day? Bounds would have been set to the great\r\nfield of philosophy, and the arts and sciences must have flourished\r\nonly within a circumscribed sphere. In vain might the revolving planets\r\nhave forced upon the minds of mankind their beautiful order, motions\r\nand attractions;――the extensive continent of America, must yet have\r\nremained a gloomy wilderness; and the wild flowers have bloomed upon\r\nher fertile plains, only to be crushed by the foot of the unlettered\r\nsavage.\r\n\r\nIf we take a retrospective view of the world, for some centuries back,\r\nwe shall find the knowledge of the most scientific nations, bounded\r\nby a circumference of two or three thousand miles. At length a few\r\nenterprising individuals, aided by their governments, made extensive\r\ndiscoveries:――A Columbus discovered the vast continent of America;\r\nand subsequent navigators discovered the extensive countries of\r\nNew-Holland, New-Zealand, and numerous islands in the Pacific ocean and\r\nSouth sea. All of these now disclose to us, that what was formerly\r\nbelieved to constitute the whole habitable world, is but a spot, one\r\nlittle corner, in the parts known at this day. Even yet, a vast portion\r\nof our globe remains unexplored. Why then should we contribute nothing\r\ntowards the attainment of the grand pursuit of nations? We, who are\r\ndestined, I hope, one day to stand as the first nation under the\r\nsun――Why should we fold our arms and sit inactive, while that little\r\nspot Great Britain, is making such efforts to explore those regions?\r\n\r\nIt would not be an unwise policy, for the American government to\r\nfoster and encourage such noble workings of genius. It can in no way\r\nbe inconsistent with the present policy of our government, that an\r\nexpedition should be fitted out to explore the polar regions; but, on\r\nthe contrary, it would bespeak a spirit of liberality, and a desire to\r\npromote scientific enterprize. It is neither against the constitution\r\nnor laws of our country; we are now at peace with the world; taxes\r\nare comparatively trifling; the situation of our country at present\r\naffords a most favourable opportunity for the accomplishment of the\r\nundertaking. It is one of such importance too, as will justify the\r\nuse of money and men; while the honour of the discovery of a New World\r\nwould be its reward.\r\n\r\nI apprehend that we only lack confidence in our own abilities,\r\nto perfect and explain many things not dreamed of by the ancient\r\nphilosophers. We are inclined rather to undervalue our own efforts;\r\nand, like our former opinions on manufacturing subjects, think we\r\ncan never appear to advantage, unless dressed in a coat of foreign\r\nmanufacture. It appears to savour of the doctrine, that no new opinion\r\nor proposition can merit attention, or be adopted, unless it come from\r\na European source. Had the proposition of concentric spheres, or a\r\nhollow globe, been made by an English or French philosopher, instead of\r\na native of the United States, I very much question, whether so large a\r\nshare of ridicule would have been attached to its author and adherents.\r\n\r\nIt may be replied, that the idea of a world within a world, is absurd.\r\nBut, who can assert with confidence, that this idea is, in reality,\r\nnothing more than the imagination of a feverish brain? How is it shown\r\nthat such a form does not exist? Are there not as strong reasons for\r\nbelieving that the earth is constituted of concentric spheres, as the\r\ncourt of Spain, or any man in Europe, had to believe that there was an\r\nundiscovered continent? Has not Captain Symmes theoretically proven\r\nhis assertions of concentric spheres and open poles, and embodied a\r\ncatalogue of facts, numerous and plausible, in support of his opinions?\r\nAnd who has confuted his assertions? I _dare_ to say, that none can be\r\nfound, who _can_ fully disprove them, and account for the facts which\r\nhe adduces as the proofs of his theory. Is there not the same reason\r\nto believe, that the earth is hollow, as there is to place implicit\r\nconfidence in the opinion, that the planets are inhabited? And yet the\r\none has been ridiculed as the wild speculations of a madman, while the\r\nother receives credit among the most enlightened.\r\n\r\nIf it can be shown that Symmes's Theory is probable, or has the least\r\nplausibility attached to it,――nay, that it is even possible,――why not\r\nafford him the means of testing its correctness? The bare possibility\r\nof such a discovery, ought to be a sufficient stimulus to call forth\r\nthe patronage of any government. And should the theory prove correct,\r\nand the adventure succeed, would it not immortalize our nation? The\r\nfame of Symmes, and his native country, would only expire with time!\r\nBut, even should the expedition fail in the main object, there would\r\nstill be neither loss nor disgrace. If the interior world have no\r\nexistence but in Captain Symmes's imagination, would it be a matter\r\nworthy of no consideration to explore the northern parts of our own\r\nhemisphere? In the attempt, we might discover something of great\r\nimportance――in chasing a phantom, we might hit on a reality――in\r\nsearching for the \"unknowable,\" discover what has hitherto been\r\nunknown; some new islands; some undiscovered sea; some north-west by\r\nwest passage, or inlet; some new phenomenon of nature; some hitherto\r\nunknown inhabitants of the polar regions; nay, even the pole itself.\r\nAnd would it be a matter of no consequence, that a citizen of our\r\nown country should first stand on the axis, and plant the stars and\r\nstripes of our own country beneath the polar star? And should this\r\nbe effected, will not the glory and honour our nation would acquire\r\nthereby, be worth the expenditure? No one, I hope, will say that it\r\nwould not be worth it all, ten times told. But in case _this_ should\r\nfail, would it be a matter of no consequence, to explore the northern\r\nparts of our own continent, and fill up the blank on the map of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere? This, in my humble opinion, is far from being\r\nimpracticable. A steam vessel might run from the mouth of the Oregon\r\nriver, and proceed along the north-west coast of America through\r\nBehring's Straits, round to the Atlantic; or, if impeded by ice, a\r\nparty might pursue their journey on foot, with sledges, on the ice,\r\nand along the coast quite round to Hudson's Bay. The accomplishment\r\nof this, I deem no chimera. The writer of this, for one, (and he has\r\nno doubt Captain Symmes, and a sufficient number of others) would\r\nvolunteer to accomplish the enterprise. And should such an expedition\r\nbe authorized and fitted out by the government, rest assured, if they\r\ndid not penetrate the interior of our sphere, or plant the American\r\nstandard beneath the _great Northern Bear_, they would at least furnish\r\na correct map of the coast of America, from the mouth of Oregon round\r\nto fort Churchill;――or make the snows of the north their winding sheets.\r\n\r\nWithin a few years, several expeditions have been fitted out for the\r\npurpose of discovery, by different nations in Europe, and particularly\r\nby the English. Ross, and Parry have visited the arctic regions; and\r\nParry now is out on his third voyage, as though there were some hidden\r\nmystery there, which the English government is anxious to develope.\r\nIt is not likely that they would have fitted-out, and dispatched\r\nfour successive expeditions, merely to view Ice-bergs and Esquimaux\r\nIndians. As for the discovery of a north-west passage to the East\r\nIndies, it cannot be their sole object, as the continent of America\r\nhas been explored by land to seventy-two degrees of north latitude;\r\nand, according to the old theory, beyond that latitude the seas are so\r\nincumbered with ice as to render their navigation extremely difficult,\r\nif not impracticable; from which, I am induced to believe, that they\r\nhave discovered something in those regions which indicates a state of\r\nthings different from that heretofore believed to exist.\r\n\r\nUnder the protection of the Russian government, Kotzebue, and Baron\r\nWrangle, have been engaged in similar enterprizes, and although these\r\ndifferent attempts have afforded considerable light on the subject,\r\nyet they are rather calculated to awaken than satisfy curiosity. Many\r\nof the facts, however, which are urged as proof of the theory of\r\nconcentric spheres, have been confirmed or corroborated by the personal\r\nobservations of those skilful navigators. But so long as they lack\r\nconfidence in the theory, it can scarcely be expected they will make\r\nthe discovery; the winding meridians which they will pursue, when\r\nintending to proceed straight forward, will keep them bewildered among\r\nthe ice, along the circle of the verge, or finally bring them out\r\ntowards the exterior surface of the sphere, no wiser than when they set\r\nout.\r\n\r\nAs yet, we are more indebted to other nations, than our own, for a\r\nknowledge of the continent of America. A knowledge of the north-west\r\ncoast is interesting to the civilized world at large; but to none more\r\nso, than the United States; and I humbly think, that the honor and\r\ninterest of this confederated Republic, are more deeply involved in\r\nthis subject of making discoveries in the northern seas, than any other\r\nnation's can be.\r\n\r\nShould a voyage of discovery be undertaken by our government, it is\r\nhoped that the northern coast of the continent of America will, at\r\nleast, be examined. The undertaking would not only redound to the fame\r\nof our country, and to that of the individual entrusted with the\r\nenterprise, but must be productive of immense advantage to our commerce\r\nand national prosperity; and carry our \"star spangled banner\" among a\r\npeople with whom the civilized world, as yet, have had no intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution of such an enterprise would be attended with no very\r\nconsiderable demands on the treasury; the employment of one or two of\r\nour ships of war, now in commission, for the object, would cause little\r\nadditional expense. But, even admitting that a few thousands, or even\r\nhundreds of thousands, would be necessary; of what importance is it,\r\nwhen weighed against the magnitude of the object to be accomplished?\r\nCould our public vessels be better employed, than in surveying our\r\nnorth-west coast, and in discovery? Our naval officers would rejoice\r\non seeing opened to their view a new path to fame, independent of the\r\nacquisition to their nautical experience. Many of our brave and skilful\r\nnavigators would be proud of an appointment in such an enterprise; many\r\nnaturalists and men of science, would cheerfully, at their own expense,\r\nif necessary, accompany such an expedition. And although we may not\r\nexpect such an enterprise to be accomplished to the full extent of\r\nCaptain Symmes's anticipations, and those who believe in his doctrines;\r\nyet, as Americans, we cannot but wish that the theory, which has been\r\nfirst advanced by a fellow-citizen, should be countenanced by our own\r\ngovernment, and tested by the citizens of our own country.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[45] The application which the Dr. makes of this structure of the\r\nearth is this: that the concave sides of the spheres are made up of\r\nmagnetic matter; that they revolve about their diurnal axes in about\r\ntwenty-four hours; that the outer sphere moves either a little faster\r\nor a little slower than the internal ball; that the magnetic pole, both\r\nof the external shell and included globe, are distant from the poles of\r\nrotation; and that the variation arises from a change of the relative\r\ndistances of the external and internal poles in consequence of the\r\ndifference of their revolutions. [See life of Dr. Halley.]\r\n\r\nIn Rees' Cyclopedia, under the article 'ring,' is the following\r\nsentence; by which it appears that Kepler first suggested the earth\r\nto be composed of concentric crusts. \"Kepler, in his Epitom. Astron.\r\nCopern. (as after him Dr. Halley, in his enquiry into the causes of the\r\nvariation of the needle, Phil. Trans. No. 195.) supposes our earth may\r\nbe composed of several _crusts_ or _shells_, one within another, and\r\nconcentric to each other. If this be the case, it is possible the ring\r\nof Saturn may be the fragment or remaining ruin of his former exterior\r\nshell, the rest of which is broken or fallen down upon the body of the\r\nplanet.\"\r\n\r\n[46] Maclaurin, in his fourteenth chapter of the second volume on\r\nFluxions, investigates the theory of Dr. Halley at considerable length;\r\nand in conclusion, appears to consider the existence of a hollow globe\r\nas very possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n _A few brief suggestions, relative to the description, tonnage, and\r\n number of vessels, necessary to be equipped for a voyage of discovery\r\n to the interior regions of the earth; the number of men necessary\r\n to be employed on board, articles necessary for the outfit, and the\r\n probable expense attending the same; also, as to the route most proper\r\n to be pursued to accomplish the object of the expedition._\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Symmes, in his first circular, published at St. Louis, on\r\nthe 10th day of April, 1818, asks an outfit of one hundred brave\r\ncompanions, well equipped, to set out from Siberia in autumn, with\r\nrein-deer and sleighs, to pass over the ice of the frozen sea. On being\r\nfurnished with an outfit of this description, he engages to explore the\r\nconcave regions, and discover a warm, or at least a temperate country,\r\nof fertile soil, well stocked with animals and vegetables, if not men,\r\non reaching about sixty-nine miles beyond latitude eighty-two degrees.\r\nThe route, intended to be pursued by Captain Symmes, appears to be that\r\nof the rein-deer, and the time of setting out, the same season of the\r\nyear, in which (according to Professor Adams) the rein-deer migrate\r\nfrom that coast north. In this route it would be necessary to cross\r\nthe verge, or region of most intense cold, with the greatest possible\r\nexpedition, so as to reach an inner temperate climate, in the shortest\r\ntime. The concave regions could be partially explored during the\r\nwinter; and the party return in the spring, and at the same time of the\r\nrein-deer, to the mouth of the river Lena.\r\n\r\nThe Russians have been making considerable exertions to explore the\r\nnorthern regions. Baron Wrangle made an attempt of this kind, in\r\nthe year 1821. And a second attempt was made in the year 1822, by\r\ntravelling with sledges, drawn by dogs.[47] But, probably owing to the\r\nparty not having faith in the winding meridians about the verge of the\r\npolar opening, or being unacquainted with their direction according\r\nto the theory of concentric spheres, they were bewildered, and kept\r\ntravelling in the neighbourhood of the verge, the region of greatest\r\ncold, instead of proceeding in a direct course towards the pole, until\r\nthey were finally obliged to return without accomplishing the object of\r\nthe expedition.\r\n\r\nAt the present time (August, 1824) an expedition is fitting out in\r\nRussia at great expense, under the auspices of that distinguished\r\npatron of science, Count Romanzoff, for the purpose of making\r\ndiscoveries in the northern regions, with the intention of exploring\r\nover land, or on the ice, as far as it may be found practicable.\r\nThe celebrated Admiral Kruzenstern, is to exercise a general\r\nsuperintendance over the expedition, while the immediate command is to\r\nbe conferred on some distinguished Russian officer.\r\n\r\nThe continent of North America, would, in my opinion, be a more\r\nsuitable place, for an exploring party to set out from, than the\r\ncoast of Siberia. A company of men, well armed, could travel over\r\nland, and draw their provisions and baggage on hand sledges, on the\r\nsnow or ice, as Hearne did during his journey, with light canoes for\r\nthe purpose of crossing rivers and lakes, should such be found to\r\nobstruct their progress. In this manner, the party would soon cross\r\nthe verge, or \"barren grounds,\" as Hearne calls it, and arrive in that\r\ncountry of abundant game, of which the Indians informed him. Hearne,\r\naccording to his journal, reached nearly the seventy-second degree\r\nof north latitude, and his general course is laid down as being\r\nnorth-westwardly, from Fort Churchill to the mouth of Copper-Mine\r\nriver, which he says disembogues itself into the Northern sea, flowing\r\nin a northerly direction. Me-lo-no-bee, the Indian chief, who served as\r\nHearne's guide from Hudson's Bay, pointed out the mouth of Copper-Mine\r\nriver, as being in a north-eastwardly direction from Fort Churchill,\r\nand flowing in an eastwardly course. Subsequent discoveries have, I\r\nbelieve, determined Me-lo-no-bee to be correct in this particular,\r\nas that river has been ascertained to empty into the waters of the\r\nAtlantic north of Repulse Bay, several hundred miles distant from\r\nwhere Hearne lays it down on his map. It is so laid down in the map\r\naccompanying Ross' voyage of discovery. How Hearne could be so much\r\nmistaken in the course he travelled, as to lay it down at nearly a\r\nright angle from its true course, is rather unaccountable: he must have\r\nbeen deceived by the winding meridians of the verge, which turned him\r\nto the right; when to have passed directly into the concave, he ought,\r\non arriving at a certain point, to have proceeded west of north, then\r\nwest, and finally south-west, which would probably have conducted\r\nhim to that country, which the Indian represented as being far to\r\nthe west, or south-west, and so warm that there was never any frost.\r\nIn this direction, an exploring party ought most probably to travel,\r\nfirst north until they come to the verge; where (if they are on the\r\ncontinent of America) the meridians begin to wind to the right, then\r\ngradually, as they advanced, incline to the west, then true west, then\r\nsouth of west, and finally, when entirely beyond the apparent verge,\r\nto the south-west, if not due south. In crossing the verge, the cold\r\nwould no doubt be considerable: but cold in those regions, as measured\r\nby the thermometer, appears to us much greater than the feelings of\r\nthose exposed to that temperature indicate. Hence it was, no doubt,\r\nthat Parry's crew could hunt in winter, when the medium was below zero.\r\nAnd the Russians set out on their expedition over the ice in 1821, when\r\nthe cold was thirty-two degrees Reaumur; and this too accounts for\r\nHearne's sleeping in the snow, without fire, by only digging a hole,\r\nand lying therein, with his sledge turned up to windward. It does not\r\nappear that he complained of excessive cold; though he travelled nearly\r\nall winter. He had also several Indian women in company. The regions\r\nthrough which he passed, as well as that in which Ross and Parry\r\nwere, are alleged to be the coldest of the earth; and that those men\r\nexperienced as great a degree of cold as would be in passing the verge\r\ninto the concave regions.\r\n\r\nBut I am of opinion that the most practicable, the most expeditious,\r\nand the best mode of exploring the interior regions would be by sea,\r\nand by way of the south polar opening, crossing the verge at the low\r\nside, in the Indian ocean, where it is presumed the sea is always open,\r\nand nearly free from ice. But, as we are residents of the northern\r\nhemisphere, the nearness of the north polar opening to us, and the\r\nmore immediate advantages which would result to us from an intercourse\r\nwith the countries within the concave to the north, would seem to\r\npoint out that as the most proper direction to be pursued; though the\r\ndifficulties to be encountered in passing the verge of the north polar\r\nopening, would doubtless be much greater than those of the south, the\r\ncold much severer, and the ice more compact and difficult to pass.\r\nHowever, notwithstanding all these difficulties, the object, I think,\r\nmight be safely accomplished by sailing, either east of Spitzbergen,\r\nor between Spitzbergen and Greenland; where, writers, in whom\r\nconfidence may be placed, inform us, that the sea is open all winter.\r\nThe greatest difficulty to be apprehended, would be the accumulation of\r\ndrifting ice in the summer season; but in the winter, that difficulty,\r\nperhaps, would not be presented as in the fall or commencement of\r\nwinter, the ice would attach itself to one shore or the other, and\r\nbecome permanent.\r\n\r\nThe Russians who wintered on Spitzbergen, say that the sea was open\r\nduring the whole winter, quite across the north end of the island.\r\nSeveral sailors who were once left on an island near Spitsbergen, lived\r\nthere several years; though destitute of almost every necessary of\r\nlife, they were not only able to support the cold of the winters, but\r\neven to supply themselves with provisions, and light, in those dreary\r\nregions. They finally returned in health and safety to their native\r\ncountry and friends. This island is probably as cold as any spot that\r\nis known to our sphere.\r\n\r\nA vessel, almost at any time in summer, could sail to, and remain at\r\nSpitzbergen, (having the necessary conveniences on board to make the\r\ncrew comfortable) for two or three years. They could lie all winter\r\nat the north part of the island, and after being there long enough to\r\nbecome acquainted with the nature and changes in the sea to the north\r\nof them, they could take some favorable opportunity, and reach the\r\npole, (if the earth be a globe) or the interior concave regions. The\r\ndistance from the north of Spitzbergen to the pole is only six hundred\r\ngeographical miles.\r\n\r\nAnother favorable direction for making the discovery is, by Bhering's\r\nstraits on the north-west coast of America: And an additional advantage\r\nwhich is presented by this direction, is, that if the vessels should be\r\nobstructed by, or frozen in the ice, the party could proceed by land\r\non the shore of America, (which is supposed to communicate with the\r\nconcave regions,) a party remaining with the vessels till the others\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nIn case an expedition of discovery should be fitted out for the purpose\r\nof making the attempt, by either route, the safety of the party would\r\nrequire that two vessels should be equipped with rather more than an\r\nordinary number of men, and with a double number of boats at least;\r\nsome so light and portable as to be easily carried by men over ice, or\r\nnecks of land, should it become necessary.\r\n\r\nVessels propelled by steam would be preferable to any other, as they\r\ncould more easily avoid the floating ice in passing the verge; as, also\r\nascend rapid rivers in the interior, should such be discovered, and it\r\nbe found necessary to ascend them. The vessels should be equipped with\r\nmasts, sails, and every part of rigging necessary for sailing; with a\r\nballast of coal, which should not be used, or any other fuel for steam\r\npurposes, until they come within the neighbourhood of the ice, through\r\nwhich, by pursuing a proper course, it is believed, they would in a\r\nfew days pass, and arrive at a more temperate climate, and a country\r\nwhere they would be abundantly supplied with both wood and provisions.\r\nPerhaps it would be advisable to take on board a small boat, with a\r\nproportionate steam-engine, for the purpose of running up shallow\r\nrivers, or along coasts, to make more minute observations.\r\n\r\nBut the most important matter of all to be observed, and that on which\r\nthe success of the expedition must depend, would be a proper observance\r\nof the principles of the theory, and a due attention to the winding\r\nmeridians, and curvatures of the parallels of latitude, when the verge\r\nshall be crossed; and which will require the party to be continually\r\nvarying their course as they proceed forward in accordance with the\r\nplace at which the attempt shall be made.\r\n\r\nThe expense of an expedition of this kind, would not be very great; at\r\nleast not considerable when compared with the magnitude of the object\r\nto be accomplished, though I have not made, nor do I consider myself\r\nadequate to make minute estimates on the subject. But I should conclude\r\nthat a sum of one or two hundred thousand dollars would be amply\r\nsufficient to defray all expenses attending such an expedition. Should\r\nan attempt be made by way of the south polar opening, with vessels\r\nfitted out as for a whaling voyage, the expense would probably not\r\nbe the one fifth part of that sum. And were an expedition undertaken\r\nover land, from some post high north on the continent of America, the\r\nexpense must be still less.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[47] _From a London paper, under the head of_\r\n\r\n\"RUSSIAN DISCOVERIES.――In the year 1820, a journey of discovery, by\r\nland, was ordered by the government, to explore the extreme north\r\nand north-east of Asia.――Lieutenants Wrangle and Anjou, of the navy,\r\nwere chosen for this expedition. After having made the necessary\r\npreparations, they departed from Neukolyma, in the north-eastern\r\npart of Siberia, on the 19th of Feb. 1821, in sledges drawn by dogs,\r\nwhen the cold was thirty-two degrees Reaumur, in order to ascertain\r\nthe position of Schehaladshoi-Noss, which captain Burney conjectured\r\nmight be an isthmus, joining Asia with the continent of America. The\r\ntravellers succeeded in determining the whole coast astronomically,\r\ngoing themselves entirely round the coast, and proceeding a day's\r\njourney farther to the west; thus convincing themselves that Asia and\r\nAmerica are not united there by an isthmus. On the 13th of March, the\r\nexpedition returned to Neukolyma. On the 22d of March, Mr. Wrangle\r\nundertook another journey, likewise on sledges drawn by dogs, with ten\r\ncompanions, in the direction to the North Pole, in order to look for\r\nthe great continent which is supposed to exist there. The principal\r\nobstacle they met with, was thin ice, which being broken to pieces\r\nby continued storms, was piled up in mountains, and rendered farther\r\nprogress impossible. At a bear hunt, which the company undertook, they\r\nobserved a sudden bursting of the ice, accompanied with a dreadful\r\nnoise resembling thunder. On their journey back, which the travellers\r\nwere obliged to make without accomplishing their object, they surveyed\r\nthe bear islands, and after an absence of thirty-eight days, arrived\r\nsafely at Neukolyma on the 28th April, where they are to remain for the\r\nyear 1822, and then to continue their researches.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n _A short Biographical sketch of Captain Symmes; with some observations\r\n on the treatment which he has met with in the advancement of his\r\n Theory._\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Cleves Symmes, the author of the Theory of Concentric Spheres, is\r\nthe son of Timothy Symmes, of the state of New-Jersey, whose father's\r\nname was also Timothy, and who was the son of the Rev. Thomas Symmes,\r\nof Bradford, who graduated at Harvard college, in 1698. Mr. Elliot,\r\npublisher of the New-England Biographical Dictionary, at Boston, in the\r\nyear 1809, makes honourable mention of his name. Timothy Symmes, the\r\ngrandfather of the subject of this sketch, had but two sons; the one,\r\nJohn Cleves Symmes, well known as the father and founder of the first\r\nsettlements in the Miami country; and the other, Timothy, the father of\r\nour Theorist, and from whom the present family of Symmes, in the Miami\r\ncountry, are descended.\r\n\r\nCaptain Symmes is now about forty-six years of age. He is of middle\r\nstature, and tolerably proportioned; with scarcely any thing in his\r\nexterior to characterize the secret operations of his mind, except an\r\nabstraction, which, from attentive inspection, is found seated on a\r\nslightly contracted brow; and the glances of a bright blue eye, that\r\noften seems fixed on something beyond immediate surrounding objects.\r\nHis head is round, and his face rather small and oval. His voice is\r\nsomewhat nasal, and he speaks hesitatingly and with apparent labour.\r\nHis manners are plain, and remarkable for native simplicity. He is a\r\nnative of the state of New-Jersey. During the early part of his life,\r\nhe received, what was then considered, a common English education,\r\nwhich in after life he improved by having access to tolerably well\r\nselected libraries; and being endued, by nature, with an insatiable\r\ndesire for knowledge of all kinds, he thus had, during the greater part\r\nof his life, ample opportunities to indulge it.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1802, and at the age of about twenty-two years, Mr. Symmes\r\nentered the army of the United States, in the office of ensign; from\r\nwhich he afterwards rose to that of captain. He continued in service\r\nuntil after the close of the late war with Great-Britain. While\r\nattached to the army he was universally esteemed a brave soldier,\r\nand a zealous and faithful officer. He was in the memorable battle\r\nof Bridgewater; and was senior Captain in the regiment to which he\r\nbelonged. The company under his immediate command, that day, discharged\r\nseventy rounds of cartridges, and repelled three desperate charges of\r\nthe bayonet.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, in the sortie from Fort Erie, Captain Symmes, with his\r\ncommand, captured the enemy's battery number two; and with his own\r\nhand spiked the cannon it contained: yet, owing to the want of correct\r\ninformation, or from some other cause, the honour and the reward of\r\nthis achievement, were alike bestowed upon others. And, it is a fact\r\nnot less to be regretted, that the official report of the battle of\r\nBridgewater, has represented the regiment, to which Captain Symmes\r\nwas attached, as almost the only one that retreated at Lunday's lane;\r\nwhen, in truth, it was nearly the only one which uniformly maintained\r\nthe positions it was _ordered_ to maintain, throughout the action.\r\nCaptain Symmes, has since, however, substantiated the correctness of\r\nits conduct, by obtaining the necessary acknowledgments; some of the\r\nparticulars of which were communicated to the Historical Society of\r\nNew-York, and published, in the newspapers of the day. The truth\r\nof this statement, has also been confirmed to me, by a respectable\r\nOfficer, who was in the action, and witnessed the occurrence.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of about three years, immediately after the close of\r\nthe war, and after Captain Symmes had left the army, he was engaged in\r\nthe difficult and laborious task of furnishing supplies to the troops\r\nstationed on the upper Mississippi. How he succeeded in this business I\r\nam not informed; but, I conclude from his present circumstances, that\r\nhe could not have realized any very considerable pecuniary advantage\r\nfrom the enterprise. Since that time he has resided at Newport,\r\nKentucky; devoting, almost exclusively, the whole of his time and\r\nattention to the investigation and perfection of his favourite Theory\r\nof Concentric Spheres.\r\n\r\nIn a short circular, dated at St. Louis, in 1818, Captain Symmes\r\nfirst promulgated the fundamental principles of his theory to the\r\nworld. He addressed a copy to every learned institution, and to every\r\nconsiderable town and village, as well as distinguished individuals, of\r\nwhich he could gain any intelligence, throughout the United States, and\r\nto several learned societies in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe reception this circular met with, was that of ridicule; it being\r\nlooked upon as the production of a distempered imagination, or the\r\nravings of partial insanity. Indeed, it became a fruitful source\r\nof jest and levity, to publishers of the public prints of the day\r\ngenerally, all over the Union. The Academy of Sciences in Paris, before\r\nwhich it was laid by Count Volney, decided that it was unworthy of\r\ntheir consideration; and the editor of the London Morning Chronicle,\r\ncould not be induced to credit the statements of respectable men, who\r\ndeclared that Symmes was not a madman. But in this, his fate is not\r\npeculiar. The experience of the world has taught us, that the authors\r\nof new doctrines, have mostly shared a similar lot. An excellent\r\ncontemporary writer has remarked, that, \"the fate of many projectors\r\nhave been so melancholy, that it requires, at this day, the daring\r\nspirit, and the enthusiasm which are naturally allied to genius, in\r\nany man to announce himself as the inventor of any thing new and\r\nextraordinary. The patience and perseverance of a Galileo, and the\r\nadventurous spirit of a Fulton, are necessary to him who would benefit\r\nhis species by the results of original plans and forms, or that of\r\nnew combinations of old and tried ones. Hence we cannot but respect\r\nand admire the man, who, regardless of the hard fate of so many who\r\nhave trod before him, in the thorny path of improvement, still has the\r\nfortitude and philosophy of mind to spend years in toil and study――to\r\nlabour by day with persevering industry――and trim the midnight lamp\r\nwith the vigilance ascribed to the ancient vestals, in bringing to\r\nperfection an idea, from which he hopes to reap fame and benefit to\r\nhimself, and to reflect credit, at the same time, on the genius of his\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Symmes published two other numbers at St. Louis, in the year\r\n1818; the one went to prove, by geometrical principles, that matter\r\nmust necessarily form itself into concentric spheres, and the other\r\ntreated of geological principles. His two next numbers, marked four\r\nand five, (the one treating of the original formation of the Allegheny\r\nmountains, and the other claiming the discovery of open poles,) I have\r\nnever had an opportunity of seeing. His sixth number appeared, dated\r\nat Cincinnati, in January, 1819, which contains a number of items and\r\nprinciples that he proposes treating of in subsequent numbers. His\r\nseventh number, entitled \"_Arctic Memoir_,\" is dated at Cincinnati,\r\nin February, 1819; and another number, entitled \"_Light between the\r\nSpheres_,\" dated at Cincinnati, in August, 1819, was published in the\r\nNational Intelligencer. From that time to the present, numerous pieces\r\nfrom the pen of Captain Symmes have appeared in different newspapers;\r\nbut the most prominent and grand doctrines, on which his theory is\r\nbased, are contained in the papers above enumerated. Independent of\r\nhis written publications, he has delivered a number of lectures on the\r\ntheory,――first at Cincinnati, in 1820, and afterwards at Lexington and\r\nFrankfort, in Kentucky, and at Hamilton and Zanesville, in the state\r\nof Ohio. Several of these lectures I had the pleasure of hearing; and\r\nthe respectable number of auditors, and the profound stillness that\r\nreigned, evinced in the strongest manner the interest felt by all\r\npresent in the subject. In addition to the various facts and phenomena,\r\nto which he adverts in support of his positions, he delineates in his\r\nlectures, upon a wooden sphere, constructed on the principles of his\r\ntheory, the cause of the winding meridians, the icy hoop or verge, and\r\nthe course which ought to be pursued to reach the interior regions,\r\nwith the confidence of mathematical certainty.\r\n\r\nCaptain Symmes's want of a classical education, and philosophic\r\nattainments, perhaps, unfits him for the office of a lecturer. But,\r\nhis arguments being presented in confused array, and clothed in\r\nhomely phraseology, can furnish no objection to the soundness of his\r\ndoctrines. The imperfection of his style, and the inelegance of his\r\nmanner, may be deplored; but, certainly, constitute no proof of the\r\ninadequacy of his reasoning, or the absurdity of his deductions.\r\nThere is scarcely a single individual, with whom I have conversed,\r\nwho does not confess that, if the facts which he adduces, and the\r\narguments he uses, were handled by an able orator, they would produce\r\na powerful effect. In short, those who attend to his lectures, without\r\nregarding his peculiarities of style and manner; who reflect alone on\r\ntheir substantial parts, without regarding the want of eloquence in\r\nthe lecturer; who presume to think for themselves, and are able to\r\ncomprehend the naked facts, and unadorned arguments, which he advances,\r\nwill not fail to discover in them many particulars well worthy of their\r\nconsideration; and many arguments calculated to stagger their faith in\r\npre-conceived opinions.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1822, Captain Symmes petitioned the Congress of the United\r\nStates, setting forth, in the first place, his belief of the existence\r\nof a habitable and accessible concave to this globe; his desire to\r\nembark on a voyage of discovery to one or other of the polar regions;\r\nhis belief in the great profit and honour his country would derive\r\nfrom such discovery;――and prayed that Congress would equip and fit out\r\nfor the expedition, two vessels of two hundred and fifty, or three\r\nhundred, tons burthen; and grant such other aid as government might\r\ndeem necessary to promote the object. This petition was presented in\r\nthe Senate by Col. Richard M. Johnston, a member from Kentucky, on the\r\n7th day of March, 1822; when, (a motion to refer it to the committee of\r\nForeign Relations having failed,) after a few remarks it was laid on\r\nthe table.――_Ayes_, 25.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1823, he forwarded similar petitions to both houses of\r\nCongress, which met with a similar fate.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1824, he petitioned the General Assembly of the state\r\nof Ohio, praying that body to pass a resolution approbatory of his\r\ntheory; and to recommend him to Congress for an outfit suitable to\r\nthe enterprise. This memorial was presented by Micajah T. Williams;\r\nand, on motion, the further consideration thereof was indefinitely\r\npostponed.[48]\r\n\r\nThat Captain Symmes is a highminded, honorable man, is attested by all\r\nwho know him. He has devised a theory whereby to account for various\r\nsingular and interesting phenomena; and more satisfactorily to explain\r\na great variety of acknowledged facts.\r\n\r\nHe argues from the effect to the cause, in many of his positions, with\r\ngreat perspicuity. And the circumstance that few of the learned have\r\nyet attempted to show that his principles are founded in absurdity,\r\nshould at least entitle him to the respect, and his theory to the\r\nattention, of every candid man. Notwithstanding he has been buffeted by\r\nthe ridicule and sarcasm of an opposing world for seven years, under\r\ngreat pecuniary embarrassments; he still labours with unshaken faith,\r\nand unbroken perseverance; with a willingness at any time to test the\r\ntruth of his speculations amid the icy mountains of the polar seas.\r\n\r\nAlready has he passed the meridian of life; and should he be called\r\nfrom time, without establishing his theory by actual discovery; the\r\nscience he has embodied, and the facts he has collected and arranged\r\nin support of it, together with his undeviating and indefatigable\r\nindustry, in the face of\r\n\r\n  \"The world's dread laugh, which scarce\r\n  The firm philosopher can scorn,\"\r\n\r\nwill bear a testimonial to his talents and worth, that the best of\r\nhis species will ever delight to acknowledge. And though he may not\r\nhave accounted for every particular, or brought forward every argument\r\nthat might possibly be advanced in support of his positions; he has,\r\nnevertheless, collected a greater number of peculiarly interesting\r\nfacts, and embodied a stronger phalanx of proof, than could well have\r\nbeen expected on a subject so new, and in the hands of the original\r\ndiscoverer.\r\n\r\nIf, hereafter, it should be ascertained that Symmes's Theory of the\r\nEarth is true, impartial posterity will not withhold the honour and\r\nfame due to the name of the discoverer.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped, however, that the present age will not so far forfeit to\r\nposterity the high character it now sustains in scientific discovery,\r\nas to remain deaf to his solicitations; but, that the citizens of\r\nour own country in particular, if not the whole world, will unite in\r\ntesting the truth of his principles; and in doing justice to the merits\r\nof this extraordinary man.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[48] Journal of the House of Representatives of Ohio; session of 1823,\r\n'24――p. 224.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:\r\n\r\nPunctuation has been standardized.\r\n\r\nSome alternate spellings have been retained.\r\n\r\nPg. iv: \"faciliate\" changed to \"facilitate\" (to facilitate its\r\nprogress).\r\n\r\nPg. 39: \"obedidience\" changed to \"obedience\" (in obedience to certain\r\nfixed laws).\r\n\r\nPg. 41, 44, 70, 79: \"spheriod\" changed to \"spheroid\" (is strictly a\r\nspheroid) (that of a regular spheroid) (the form of an oblate spheroid)\r\n(a compact and solid spheroid) (the earth is a solid spheroid).\r\n\r\nPg. 57, 130: \"occular\" changed to \"ocular\" (positive ocular\r\ndemonstration) (admits of ocular demonstration).\r\n\r\nPg. 62: \"sometimes\" changed to \"some times\" (at some times seven or\r\neight belts).\r\n\r\nPg. 73: \"appea\" changed to \"appear\" (and appear again in great\r\nnumbers).
