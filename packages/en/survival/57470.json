As a matter of fact they\r\nwere well acquainted with their regular customers; but these came only\r\nin the hours devoted to business, tarried no longer than was absolutely\r\nnecessary, and probably cared not one whit how these merchants passed\r\ntheir leisure time.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this comparative isolation was the cause of Philip’s devoting\r\nhimself with such assiduity to his profession, if such it may be termed.\r\nFrom his childhood the senior Garland had instilled into his son’s mind\r\nthe rudiments of natural history, and having the rare faculty of so\r\npresenting dry subjects as to make them interesting, he had so thoroughly\r\nenlisted the boy’s attention and sympathies that when Master Philip\r\nfound himself at the head of the establishment he was one of the most\r\nenthusiastic students.\r\n\r\nUnlike his father, he was a naturalist in the full sense of the word, and\r\ndevoted himself more particularly to noting the peculiarities and habits\r\nof four-handed mammals, otherwise known as the monkey tribe.\r\n\r\nIn two months after the elder Garland died Philip’s collection was\r\ncomposed principally of apes, he having so reduced the stock by forced\r\nsales that nearly every other species of animal, as well as the entire\r\nlot of birds, had given way to the tribe in whose habits he was so deeply\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, any variety of the monkey-kind are more valuable\r\nwhen their talents for imitation have been developed by the aid of\r\neducation, and the new head of the house of Garland & Co. made a point of\r\ninstructing his live articles of merchandise in the most thorough manner.\r\n\r\nDuring every hour of the day, when not engaged with customers, Philip\r\ntaught the apes to throw somersaults, jump through hoops, dance, play\r\nthe tambourine, and a variety of similar accomplishments. He also had\r\nseveral so highly educated as to march at the word of command, present\r\narms, fire a musket, fence, or salute in true military fashion.\r\n\r\nQuite naturally this reduction of stock to a single and not very rare\r\nspecies of animal caused a corresponding falling off in the number\r\nof customers. But for this Philip cared little. His bank account was\r\nsufficiently large to admit of his conducting the business after his own\r\npeculiar fashion, regardless of whether the balance at the end of the\r\nyear was in his favor or not; and as the sales were limited so did his\r\nstock increase, until, at the time when an old friend of his father’s,\r\nCaptain Seaworth, master of the good ship Reynard, called in company with\r\nhis first and second officers at what was now little more than a monkey\r\nemporium, to give the young man good advice, he was greatly amused at the\r\nproficiency to which these long-tailed animals had been brought.\r\n\r\nAmong the large collection were four which attracted the most attention;\r\nand, as may be supposed, these were the ones upon whom Philip had spent\r\nthe greater portion of his time in teaching. Two were enormous baboons,\r\nstrong as giants, and of corresponding ferocity. When their instruction\r\nwas begun they would oftentimes seize the iron rods which were used in\r\nthe way of discipline, bending them like straws; and more than once had\r\ntheir teacher battled for his life when these pupils escaped from the\r\nstoutly-barred cage. Finally, however, both had been partially subdued\r\nthrough fear, not love, until, with many a grimace and angry gesture,\r\nthey would obey in a surly manner the orders given.\r\n\r\nThat these brutes knew exactly what their teacher desired of them was\r\nshown even when they refused to do his bidding. Both were well aware when\r\nthe hour for study had come, and from their movements one would have said\r\nthey were discussing the question as to whether it was best to learn\r\nanything on this particular day or hold out against the master at the\r\nexpense of a severe flogging.\r\n\r\nPhilip often said that there was no animal in his collection who\r\nunderstood the human voice better than these same ferocious brutes, and\r\ntheir disobedience was only proof of their vicious natures.\r\n\r\n“Those fellows know enough to put me through the same course of\r\ninstruction, provided they held the iron rod and had the opportunity,”\r\nPhilip often said to his assistants; and at such remarks the larger of\r\nthe baboons actually wrinkled his face into what was very like a smile,\r\nas if thinking of the glorious time he could have in turning the tables\r\non his not very gentle teacher.\r\n\r\nThis interesting couple had not inaptly been christened Goliah and Magog.\r\n\r\nThe other notable members of the collection were quite the opposite, both\r\nin disposition and appearance. They were a male and female chimpanzee,\r\nyoung, and not absolutely ill-favored, if one should compare them with\r\nthe monkey type of beauty. Both were tractable, obeyed every command as\r\nreadily as the best-behaved children, and regarded their master with an\r\naffection which seemed almost human.\r\n\r\nPhilip had named the male Ben Bolt and the female Sweet Alice, because\r\nthe regard which each apparently entertained for the other was quite as\r\nfervent, in their monkey way, as is supposed to have been that of the\r\nlovers mentioned in the song.\r\n\r\nThese two appeared to be perfectly contented in the Garland\r\nestablishment. They were not only docile, but seemingly delighted at\r\nbeing able to show their proficiency when Philip taught them new tricks,\r\nand the female in particular obeyed the slightest word as readily as any\r\nhuman being could have done. Yet these tractable pupils, who never needed\r\nthe discipline of the iron rod, had more than their share of trouble\r\nin the fact that Goliah was most desperately smitten with Sweet Alice,\r\nand would at every opportunity display this fact in a very disagreeable\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nIn his own peculiar fashion it could plainly be seen, even by a casual\r\nobserver, that this monkey-love was something terrible in its intensity.\r\nWhenever, as frequently happened, the two favorite animals were allowed\r\nthe liberty of the museum, this huge baboon would give proof of the most\r\nviolent rage toward Ben Bolt, and on more than one occasion had Philip’s\r\niron rod been the only thing which saved the chimpanzee from Goliah’s\r\nhideous jealousy. He would shake the bars of his cage in an excess of\r\nanger if Ben came near him, and make the most frantic efforts to seize\r\nhis rival; but thus far the lovers had escaped any serious injury.\r\n\r\nCaptain Seaworth, actuated by a desire to assist the son of his old\r\nfriend, decided to purchase, for his amusement during the long voyage\r\nhe was about to undertake, one of the baboons, and to this end selected\r\nGoliah, much to the pleasure of Philip.\r\n\r\nHis officers, following the example of their commander, also made\r\novertures for the purchase of Ben Bolt and Sweet Alice, together with\r\nfour other less intelligent but well-mannered apes of the collection.\r\n\r\nFor some time Philip was undecided whether to part with the two\r\nchimpanzees, whom he looked upon more as pets than articles of\r\nmerchandise; but yielding to persuasion and promises that they should not\r\nonly be cared for tenderly, but kept far from the ill-favored Goliah, he\r\nfinally consented.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if the chimpanzees understood that they were about to\r\nbe separated from their kind master, and in every way by which it is\r\npossible for brutes to show grief they displayed it, until the animal\r\ndealer was forced to leave his establishment during the transfer.\r\n\r\nOf Captain Seaworth’s intended voyage Philip already knew, as did that\r\nportion of the public who make a practice of reading all the daily\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\nUnder the auspices of a corporation made up of coffee merchants in New\r\nYork and its vicinity, the Reynard was bound for one of the many islands\r\nof the Malay Archipelago, there to found a colony for the purpose of\r\nraising coffee on a gigantic scale. The captain’s orders were to consult\r\nwith the agents of the corporation at Batavia, who would make a selection\r\nof some land near Borneo which could be leased or purchased, there\r\nlanding the laborers, and directing their movements until the enterprise\r\nshould be well begun. After that, Captain Seaworth would proceed in\r\naccordance with such instructions as might be received from home.\r\n\r\nThus it was a long voyage that these dumb members of Philip’s\r\nestablishment were to take, and it is little wonder that he feared for\r\nthe safety of Ben Bolt and Sweet Alice while on shipboard with the\r\nferocious and mighty Goliah.\r\n\r\nIf the young merchant had had the slightest idea of the wicked cunning\r\nin the breast of the huge baboon, it is safe to say he would never have\r\nconsented to sell him to a friend such as Captain Seaworth; and, also,\r\ncould he have known how much suffering this same animal would cause him\r\nin the future, Goliah’s career might have been ended very suddenly by a\r\npistol-ball. Then the reasons for the writing of this story could hardly\r\nhave existed.\r\n\r\n“Treat the animals well, but let them know you are the master,” Philip\r\nsaid to the captain on the day the latter made his final visit to\r\nthe establishment. “They have considerably more intelligence than is\r\ngenerally credited to them, and I oftentimes imagine they understand\r\nvery much of ones conversation.”\r\n\r\nPhilip really believed that this species of animal comprehended many\r\nwords; and it was destined that his experience in the future, although\r\ncovering but a short space of time, should eclipse all he had thus far\r\nlearned from books or by observation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMAGOG’S REVENGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin an hour from the time Captain Seaworth and his officers had taken\r\ntheir purchases to the ship, it was apparent to every employe of Garland\r\n& Co.’s establishment that the baboon, Magog, was in a towering rage.\r\n\r\nHad he been able to speak he could not have indicated more plainly his\r\nanger at being thus separated from his old companion; and after that time\r\nit was dangerous for either Philip or the attendants to approach within\r\nreach of the cage.\r\n\r\nHis fury increased with time, until the most venturesome of museum\r\nproprietors would have hesitated to receive the huge brute as a gift, for\r\na wounded tiger could not have been more intractable.\r\n\r\nMany times before six months had elapsed did Philip contemplate killing\r\nthe ferocious captive; but on every occasion when he had almost decided\r\nso to do, the hope that he might succeed in taming him prevented the\r\ncommission of the deed.\r\n\r\nIt was seven months from the day the Reynard left port when Philip\r\nmade his last attempt at subduing Magog. On this afternoon he allowed\r\nthe ferocious ape to come out into the exercise-hall of the animals’\r\nquarters, and before the lesson was well begun a number of old customers\r\narrived, causing the merchant to return the captive hurriedly to his\r\ncage. In his desire to make haste the usual precautions were neglected,\r\nand Magog’s eyes twinkled with satisfaction as he noted the insecure\r\nfastenings of his prison.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of that day he was unusually quiet, and the keepers\r\nwondered not a little as to the cause of his remarkable docility, for\r\nthere was hardly an hour since Goliah had been taken away during which he\r\ndid not make the most frantic efforts to escape.\r\n\r\nWhen Philip conducted his customers through this particular portion of\r\nthe establishment Magog was sitting contentedly in one corner of his\r\ncage, and the merchant said, in a tone of pride:\r\n\r\n“There is a baboon that has given me more trouble than all the rest of\r\nthe collection; but I am fast subduing him, and soon we shall have no\r\nmore tractable performer than he. Three months from now I will show you\r\nthis fellow transformed into the most agile and willing acrobat.”\r\n\r\nAgain Magog’s eyes twinkled, as if he understood the remark and was\r\ncontent to bide his time until the plan of revenge which, perhaps, had\r\nbeen maturing in his mind so long, should be ready for execution.\r\n\r\nThe wily ape had not long to wait. On that very night, when the\r\nattendants vacated the large hall, which was lined on every side with\r\ncages, they left one gas-jet burning, according to custom, and firmly\r\nbarred the door on the outside. This was the opportunity Magog desired.\r\n\r\nThe bolt of his cage was so insecurely fastened as to be very easily\r\nslipped back; and as if he understood that the slightest unusual sound\r\nmight betray his purpose, he stole softly into the hall, looked about him\r\nin every direction until satisfied he was the only one free, and then\r\nturned on the gas, as he had often seen Philip’s employes do.\r\n\r\nA wisp of straw from his own cage served the same purpose as a torch such\r\nas was generally used for lighting the other jets, and in a few moments\r\nhe had the place brilliantly illuminated, but not in such a thorough\r\nmanner as satisfied him.\r\n\r\nMore straw was at hand. He pulled armfuls from every cage, heaping it\r\nhigh, until his own was nearly filled, and then, with a savage cry of\r\nwhat might well have been mistaken for pleasure, applied the torch to\r\nthis inflammable material.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the entire room was in flames, and the vengeful baboon,\r\nleaping from one point to another regardless of his own injuries, was\r\nscattering fire here and there, until any effort at saving Garland &\r\nCo.’s establishment would have been useless.\r\n\r\nWhen the morning sun arose Philip found himself without employment. All\r\nof the monkey tribe upon whom he had devoted so much time and attention\r\nwere now as thoroughly roasted as any African epicure could have\r\ndesired; and among these possibly savory bodies reposed that of Magog,\r\nwhose revenge had culminated in his own death.\r\n\r\nPhilip was still young. He had plenty of money at his command, and there\r\nwas but one desire in his heart, viz.: to rebuild and restock an animal\r\nemporium which should far excel the one destroyed.\r\n\r\nBut this could not be done by remaining in New York.\r\n\r\nThus far he had been the largest dealer in animals in the country,\r\nand the combined stock of all the others put together would not have\r\nsufficed to form such a collection as the one just burned; therefore it\r\nwas necessary he should search among the jungles and in the forests for\r\nthe various specimens of that tribe toward whom all his studies had been\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\nWhen one has almost unlimited means at his command, to desire is to\r\naccomplish, providing energy is not wanting, and Philip Garland lost no\r\ntime in carrying out what had now become his sole aim in life.\r\n\r\nThe bark Swallow, four hundred tons burden, was advertised for charter,\r\nand with her owners the young merchant made a bargain for the exclusive\r\nuse of the craft during a period of three years.\r\n\r\nThen came the labor of preparing cages, putting in stores, fitting the\r\nhold for the reception of the strange passengers whom it was proposed to\r\nbring back, and otherwise making the many arrangements necessary for such\r\na cruise.\r\n\r\nIn due course of time all this was performed, and eight months from the\r\nday the Reynard left port with the choicest portion of Garland & Co.’s\r\ncollection on board the Swallow was towed down to Sandy Hook. From there,\r\nspreading her white wings, she sped away toward the Malay Archipelago,\r\nfrom whence she was to proceed, in case a sufficient number of animals\r\nand birds were not procured there, to the southernmost point of Africa,\r\non her return home.\r\n\r\nOf the voyage out it is hardly necessary to speak. The first stop was at\r\nthe Ascension Islands for water, and then, passing on within sight of St.\r\nHelena, they made the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nIt had not been Philip’s intention to take on any animals at this point\r\nuntil his return; but the agent of a Hamburg firm had just come down to\r\nthe coast with a rare lot, which he offered at prices so exceedingly\r\nlow as to make it an object to keep them on shipboard during the entire\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\nThe collection was made up of a black two-horned rhinoceros, three lions,\r\ntwo panthers, and three serpents.\r\n\r\nThe agent had expected to find the firm’s ship in port; but through some\r\nmisunderstanding or disaster she was not there, and it became necessary\r\nfor him to dispose of the stock at any price rather than remain an\r\nindefinite length of time for the vessel, which might never come.\r\n\r\nPhilip soon effected a trade upon such a basis that if he should save\r\neither of the animals until his return home the venture would be a paying\r\none, and the transfer of these unwilling and unwieldy passengers was at\r\nonce begun.\r\n\r\nThe rhinoceros was confined in a pen of wood and iron just abaft the\r\nforemast, where he had very little room to spare, and immediately after\r\ncoming on board the huge brute appeared as docile and contented as could\r\nhave been desired.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the entire collection had been brought from the shore without\r\nthe slightest difficulty, and after a stay of only two days the Swallow\r\nset sail, making an offing about sunset.\r\n\r\nWhen darkness settled down over the waste of waters the new passengers\r\nbegan to make their presence known, and from that time until morning no\r\none on board could have entertained the slightest doubt as to the nature\r\nof this partial cargo, for the howls, roars, yelps and screams would have\r\ndrowned the shrieking of the wildest tempest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nA TERRIBLE NIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the setting of the sun the wind came in fitful gusts, betokening a\r\nstorm, if not a hurricane.\r\n\r\nDuring the first few hours of darkness the rhinoceros did not join in\r\nthe concert begun by the other animals; but as the wind increased in\r\nviolence, and the sea became more choppy, causing the bark to reel and\r\nstagger under the heavy blows, the deck-passengers became decidedly\r\nuneasy. When the lions were not roaring, or the panthers screaming, the\r\nthick-skinned captive would utter a loud “woof,” and make such an attack\r\non his cage that the watch on deck were ready to leap into the rigging at\r\nthe first sign that he was succeeding in his efforts.\r\n\r\nEach animal had been captured singly, and all were full-grown and\r\ndangerous. The near presence of the men, the sight of each other, and the\r\nviolent motions of the bark, alarmed every one. Even the serpents were\r\nwide awake and vengeful; but the rhinoceros was furious with rage. He\r\nraked his great horn back and forth across the bars of the pen whenever\r\nany one went near him, and in a dozen ways gave evidence of his strength.\r\n\r\nMost probably the unusual motion made every member of the collection\r\nseasick, and as the malady increased so did their rage. Philip knew\r\nthat during the first forty-eight hours the danger would be greatest,\r\nand he kept a watchful eye upon the noisy passengers. After they had\r\ngotten their “sea-legs” on, as sailors express it, there would be no more\r\npossibility of trouble than under the same circumstances ashore, and to\r\nget them safely through this period of probation was now his only care.\r\n\r\nAbout a quarter of an hour before midnight, when all the watch on deck\r\nsave the man at the wheel were forward, the rhinoceros leaned heavily\r\nagainst the side of his cage just as the bark buried her bow in a green\r\nwave, which, curling over the forecastle, swept every movable thing aft.\r\nImmediately following this came a great crash, startling the already\r\nfrightened crew.\r\n\r\nThe mighty plunge of the vessel, together with the weight of the animal\r\non the bars of the cage, had crushed them like pipe-stems, and the huge\r\nmonster emerged from the ruins fully prepared for mischief.\r\n\r\nA more dangerous and vindictive creature than a black rhinoceros cannot\r\nbe found. He is in the sulks nearly all the time, and while under such\r\ninfluence or humor will charge an elephant or a lion without fear of the\r\nresult. The first thing which comes in sight is attacked, and he never\r\ncools down so long as there is anything on which to wreak his vengeance.\r\n\r\nIt was as if the tossing of the vessel served to excite his anger\r\nstill more, and he made desperate lunges here and there at the nearest\r\ninanimate objects, sometimes being thrown from his feet as the bark rose\r\nor fell; and, again, splintering into fragments such lighter articles\r\nas the hen-coops, the captain’s gig, which was stowed on deck, and the\r\ncrates containing fresh vegetables taken on board at Cape Town.\r\n\r\nAt the first intimation of this danger, which was more imminent than the\r\nthreatening elements, the sailors leaped into the rigging, and for ten\r\nminutes the monster had the deck nearly to himself.\r\n\r\nAfter having fallen several times the old fellow looked about, as if\r\nstudying how he could soonest recover his sea-legs, and when that brief\r\ntime of apparent thoughtfulness had passed he was as steady as a sailor.\r\nThe rise and fall of the bark, abrupt and sharp as it was, caused him to\r\nslide to and fro, but he never lost his equilibrium.\r\n\r\nAfter thus regaining control of his unwieldy body, the first thing which\r\nattracted his attention was the cage containing the serpents. With one\r\nmighty rush he tossed it in the air, and as it came down the three\r\nhissing occupants glided in different directions, one climbing over the\r\ncage containing the panthers, the second going on to the bowsprit, and\r\nthe third darting into the forecastle out of sight.\r\n\r\nThe lions and panthers immediately raised a terrible din, which, with the\r\nroaring of the gale, made the confusion most deafening. The big beast\r\ncleared his horn of the fragments of the cage hanging to it, and then\r\nstruck that containing the panther.\r\n\r\nThese animals were liberated in an instant. One ran aft into the\r\nlong-boat, which hung on the davits, crouching under the thwarts; and the\r\nother, cowed for the moment, but ready for mischief, retreated to the\r\nlee-scuppers.\r\n\r\nWithout so much as glancing at the panthers, the rhinoceros dashed at the\r\npen of the lions, smashing it into kindlings.\r\n\r\nThe largest of the three captives sprang upon his adversary’s back as\r\nhe shook himself free from the fragments, and perhaps his sharp claws\r\ninflicted some injury, but not enough to check the fury of the beast, who\r\nchased the second one aft to the quarter-deck.\r\n\r\nThe third lion disappeared in the forecastle; and never was a watch\r\nbelow awakened more quickly or more thoroughly than were those who came\r\ntumbling up, half-dressed, terrified, and not knowing in which direction\r\nsafety might be found.\r\n\r\nNo ship’s crew ever were in a stranger situation. It was high time sail\r\nshould be shortened, the mate in charge having delayed this work until\r\nboth watches should be on deck; and with these enraged animals virtually\r\nin possession, the bravest sailor would hardly have dared to leave the\r\nrigging.\r\n\r\nThe helmsman remained at his post of duty despite the fact that the\r\npanther was in the long-boat behind him, and it was his shrieks that\r\ncalled Philip, the captain and second officer from the cabin.\r\n\r\nHardly did they emerge from the companion-way when the lion which had\r\nattacked the rhinoceros came bounding aft, and the three men fled below\r\nagain, the helmsman following them and closing the hatch behind him.\r\n\r\nTo leave this place of refuge immediately meant death, while by remaining\r\nin it destruction seemed equally certain. Yet, strange to say, the\r\ngallant vessel sped before the wind as if a steady hand guided her\r\nmovements; and five minutes later, Philip, accustomed from infancy to\r\nsuch animals, had burst his way out through the deck-window of the cabin.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course there were plenty of heavy guns and ammunition on\r\nboard; and with a Manton rifle and explosive shells, he sheltered himself\r\nbehind the foremast, where he immediately opened fire on the nearest\r\nbrute.\r\n\r\nWhile he was making every effort to draw the rhinoceros toward him, in\r\norder to get a fairer mark, the lion on the quarter-deck leaped into the\r\nlong-boat upon the panther. In the merest fraction of time the two were\r\nbounding over the thwarts and tumbling about in the wildest fashion, the\r\nboat rocking to and fro as if it would upset, the screams and roars of\r\nthe struggling beasts drowning all the other horrible noises.\r\n\r\nThis fight attracted the attention of the rhinoceros, causing him,\r\ndespite Philip’s endeavors, to make his way aft, where he came across the\r\nlion who was skulking in the scuppers. To drive the king of beasts back\r\ntoward the wheel was not difficult for the huge monster, who was now so\r\nblinded by rage that he made a direct dash at the cabin-door.\r\n\r\nNo wood ever grew that could withstand such an assault, and as the\r\nrhinoceros forced his way into the saloon the captain and second mate\r\ntook refuge in the steward’s pantry, where they were even closer\r\nprisoners than before.\r\n\r\nStraight on the charge was continued!\r\n\r\nThe dining-table was overturned, the chairs swept from their fastenings\r\nlike so many things of straw, and as the after-end of the cabin was\r\nreached the bark rose to a huge wave. As a matter of course this gave an\r\nadditional impetus to the enormous animal, and with a crash he plunged\r\ndirectly through the bulk-head, which formed what might be termed a\r\ndeck-lazaret, where he was held fast by the heavy timbers despite his\r\nfurious struggles. This gave the imprisoned ones in the pantry an\r\nopportunity to escape, and they reached the deck just as Philip, running\r\nto the wheel, opened fire on the animals in the boat.\r\n\r\nOne discharge of the weapon point-blank at the beasts, who had grappled\r\nand were rearing up from the thwarts, together with the rocking of the\r\nfrail craft, caused the combatants to topple over the rail, and two of\r\nthe disagreeable passengers were stricken from the list.\r\n\r\nAt this moment one of the crew shouted that a panther, a lion and two\r\nof the serpents were in the forecastle; and for the captain and second\r\nofficer to imprison them by closing the hatch was but the work of a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nThat the rhinoceros could do little or no damage while in his present\r\nposition Philip understood from what he had been told, and he turned his\r\nattention to the remaining lion, crouching near the water-butt, while the\r\ncarpenter attacked the snake, who was making his way up the mainmast.\r\n\r\nThis last passenger was disposed of in short order, but not until he had\r\nbeen chopped into many pieces; and during such carving Philip succeeded\r\nin implanting a lucky shot directly in the heart of the lion, which\r\neffectually ended this portion of the struggle.\r\n\r\nThe crew paid no further attention to the other animals, but bent all\r\ntheir energies to saving the gallant craft which had, unattended, borne\r\nthem on so bravely in the face of the gale. With nearly every member\r\nof both watches in the rigging the work of shortening sail was quickly\r\nperformed; and, as the bark rode more easily over the mountainous seas,\r\nPhilip and the captain went below to still the struggle of their unwieldy\r\ncabin passenger.\r\n\r\nIt required a dozen shots from the heavy rifle before the huge and\r\nhelpless brute gave up his life. The work of removing the body could\r\nnot be attended to during the hours of darkness, neither was it deemed\r\nadvisable to make any effort at cleaning the forecastle. It would be “all\r\nhands on deck” till morning; but that was a minor consideration in view\r\nof the fact that they had escaped so many dangers.\r\n\r\nAfter barricading the forecastle hatch with chain-cables and other heavy\r\narticles which would resist any pressure from within, the crew spent\r\nthe remainder of the night listening to the sounds of conflict. They\r\ncould hear the hiss of the serpents, the screams of the panther, and the\r\ngrowling of the lion until nearly morning, when all became silent. The\r\nanimals were either dead or had concluded to suspend hostilities for\r\nawhile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE WRECK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the rising sun the wind abated, and when it was sufficiently light\r\nall hands set about the task of cleaning ship.\r\n\r\nTo remove the huge animal from the cabin it was necessary to literally\r\nchop him in such pieces as could be readily handled, and two hours\r\nelapsed before the last fragment had been thrown overboard to the\r\nfollowing sharks.\r\n\r\nThen all hands, save the man at the wheel, armed with cutlasses, rifles\r\nand capstan-bars, gathered around the forecastle hatch as it was pushed\r\nback.\r\n\r\nA terrible stench arose, but no sound was heard. After five minutes\r\nPhilip descended the ladder with a revolver in each hand; but no enemy\r\nconfronted him. There had been a general battle, during which the beasts\r\nwere mangled and torn in the most horrible manner, while the serpents\r\nwere literally cut in pieces.\r\n\r\nNot until twenty-four hours had passed was the bark free from odor,\r\nblood, and other evidences of the conflict; and during the week which\r\nfollowed the carpenter and his assistants had quite as much as they could\r\ndo to repair the injury done the cabin.\r\n\r\nPhilip’s venture had not proven a paying one; but in view of what might\r\nhave happened he was only too well pleased to be rid of his dangerous\r\nmerchandise. As he thought of this, the first speculation since Magog\r\ndestroyed the establishment, and reflected upon the result of it, there\r\ncame into his mind a fear that it might be the beginning of a series of\r\nmisfortunes.\r\n\r\nOf course such superstitious fears were more than childish, and he\r\nstruggled manfully but unsuccessfully to put them far from him.\r\n\r\nThat which had just occurred, however, was but a foretaste of what might\r\nbe expected when there was a full cargo of animals on board; and in the\r\nforecastle the sailors discussed the possible fate of all hands during\r\nthe homeward voyage.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been in ships what was becalmed week in an’ week out for two\r\nmonths, with never a cat to throw overboard,” old Tom Bixbee said, as\r\nthe watch below were reviewing the events of the past few hours, “but I\r\nnever struck on anything like this craft. Talk of havin’ a drownded man\r\nas shipmate! Why, that’s nothin’ compared to what’s goin’ to happen on\r\nthis’ ere barkey when she turns her nose toward home. If there’s ever a\r\nchance of showin’ my heels to the Swallow in this ’ere benighted place\r\nwe’re bound for after more jest like sich as we had last night, you’ll\r\nsee precious little of me!”\r\n\r\nAnd Tom’s opinion was very much the same as that entertained by every\r\nmember of the crew.\r\n\r\nAs the bark continued on with favoring winds through the Indian Ocean,\r\nnever a day passed but that some one of the sailors had a particularly\r\nharrowing tale to tell of ghost-infested ships, and the conclusion to\r\neach would invariably be:\r\n\r\n“But they couldn’t hold a candle to a craft like this what’s goin’ to\r\ntake on board sich a crowd as we left Cape Town with.”\r\n\r\nSailors on a long voyage have plenty of opportunity for strengthening\r\ntheir strong belief in the supernatural, and in this case the reasons\r\nfor misgivings were so real that it is little wonder all hands, from\r\nthe boatswain to the cook, were in a state very nearly bordering on\r\ninsubordination when the Swallow entered the Straits of Sunda, bearing to\r\nthe westward on a course to the Celebes.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was because of this mutinous condition of the men that the\r\nbark was not kept true to the needle, or, again, it may have been that\r\nthe captain was at fault in his navigation. At all events, on the morning\r\nof the fourth day after leaving the straits, while sailing over a\r\nmirror-like sea and under cloudless skies, the Swallow brought up with a\r\nterrific crash against a sunken reef.\r\n\r\nIn an instant all was confusion. Orders were not obeyed as promptly as\r\nshould have been the case, because the sailors had settled in their minds\r\nthat this was an incident to be expected during such a cruise, and for\r\nseveral moments the bark pounded and thumped upon the rock until, without\r\nthe aid of her crew, she slipped off into deep water again.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, the first thing after this hidden danger had\r\napparently been passed in safety was to sound the well, and to the\r\ndismay of Philip, if not of the insubordinate crew, it was learned that\r\nthe bark was leaking.\r\n\r\nThe damage done was something even more serious than the starting of a\r\ntimber, as could be told from the fact that in half an hour the depth of\r\nwater in the hold had increased from four to nine inches.\r\n\r\nAt that rate it was only a question of a few hours before the vessel\r\nwould founder; but it was possible the injury might be so far repaired as\r\nto admit of her reaching some island on which she could be beached, and\r\nthe men were stationed at the pumps while the carpenter and first mate\r\nwent into the hold.\r\n\r\nTom Bixbee boldly announced that in his opinion the best thing they\r\ncould do would be to “save their own precious selves, an’ leave the old\r\nbarkey to sink if she wanted to;” and this advice might possibly have\r\nbeen followed, owing to the frame of mind in which the crew were, if the\r\nofficers and Philip had not assumed such a determined front.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the point of revolvers were the men forced to labor at the\r\npumps; and as if this disaster was not enough to dishearten Philip, the\r\nelements began to play their part in wrecking the craft which had come so\r\nfar for such a strange cargo.\r\n\r\nIn two hours the breeze from the south had increased to a gale. The\r\nsea suddenly rose very high, and with all the light canvas stowed, the\r\nsinking vessel was headed toward the coast of Borneo under storm-sails\r\nonly. There was little hope in the minds of the most sanguine that she\r\ncould float much longer; but yet the only chance of safety was in making\r\nland.\r\n\r\nSome time previous the carpenter had made his report privately to the\r\ncaptain; but the crew understood very well from the expression of his\r\nface how imminent was the danger which threatened.\r\n\r\nThe damage was so near the keel that it could not be gotten at without\r\nremoving the ballast, a task which was impossible of execution owing to\r\nthe rapidity with which the bark was settling.\r\n\r\n“She would be at the bottom before we could so much as come at the leak,”\r\nthe first mate said; and it was owing to his report that the Swallow had\r\nbeen headed for the coast.\r\n\r\nThe wind increased hourly, and in addition to the water which came\r\nthrough the shattered hull, large quantities were taken over the rail.\r\n\r\nAbout three o’clock in the afternoon a heavy sea washed away the port\r\nbulwarks fore and aft, completely flooding the decks, forecastle and\r\ncabin. The port quarter-boat was crushed like an egg-shell, leaving a few\r\nsplintered fragments hanging in the davits, swinging to and fro in what\r\nthe crew fancied was an ominously suggestive manner.\r\n\r\nThen the sailors mutinied in downright earnest. With Tom Bixbee as the\r\nspokesman they declared it was useless labor to attempt to sail what\r\nwas hardly more than a wreck, and that their lives were imperiled by\r\nremaining longer on board.\r\n\r\n“The only chance we’ve got of saving a single soul is by sticking to the\r\nbark!” the captain shouted. “We are hardly fifty miles from the coast,\r\nand she can be kept afloat long enough to make that distance with this\r\nwind.”\r\n\r\nAgain by a liberal display of weapons the men were forced to return to\r\nthe pumps; but at sunset the water had gained upon them so steadily that\r\nthe doomed craft began to settle and roll heavily in the cross-seas.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, when even the captain was disheartened, the starboard\r\npump choked, and with only the port one serviceable it was no longer\r\nreasonable to think of keeping her afloat.\r\n\r\nAs the captain and Philip, both of whom had been on deck continuously\r\nsince the hidden reef was struck, turned to go into the cabin for the\r\npurpose of saving such valuables as could readily be taken away, the men\r\nbecame like demons.\r\n\r\nThere were only two serviceable boats remaining since the gig had been\r\ndestroyed by the rhinoceros and the port quarter-boat carried away in\r\nthe wreck of the bulwarks, therefore the possibilities of taking off the\r\nentire crew seemed limited.\r\n\r\nFully aware of this fact, the men took advantage of the captain’s\r\ntemporary absence to abandon the ship, without regard to supplies of food\r\nand water, and despite the threats of the other officers.\r\n\r\nThe long-boat was stove in the launching, owing to the absence of\r\ndiscipline, and the starboard quarter-boat nearly swamped as she was\r\ndropped heavily by the unreasoning men.\r\n\r\nWhen the captain came on deck the crew had taken to the boat, already\r\nhalf-filled with water, and were some distance from the sinking bark.\r\n\r\nIt would have been useless to force them to return, even if such a thing\r\nwas possible, for the little craft could not approach the foundering bark\r\nin the teeth of the gale without being stove to pieces, and the four\r\nofficers and Philip stood gazing at the rapidly retreating boat with\r\ndespair written on every feature of their countenances.\r\n\r\nThis was the culmination of disasters, and from it there appeared to be\r\nno way of escape.\r\n\r\nThey could do but little toward providing for their own safety. It was\r\nsimply a question of whether the wreck would float until some friendly\r\ncraft could be sighted; and this was answered within two hours from the\r\ntime the crew abandoned her.\r\n\r\nWhile the five despairing men were busily engaged constructing a raft of\r\nsuch materials as could be hastily gathered from the wave-swept deck, the\r\nSwallow gave a mighty lurch to port; then rising on her stern-post, as if\r\nendeavoring to escape from the doom which was now so close at hand, she\r\nsettled to starboard with such rapidity that those on board had not even\r\ntime to throw over the timbers they had partially lashed together.\r\n\r\nFortunately, so far as Philip Garland was concerned, he had been hurled\r\nbeyond the whirlpool caused by the foundering vessel, and as he struck\r\nout, instinctively rather than because of hope, his hands came in\r\ncontact with the fragments of the quarter-boat.\r\n\r\nDazed by the shock and blinded with the driving spray, he grasped with\r\nthe clutch of a dying man the frail timbers, and heeded not the black\r\nclouds which opened to belch forth fire and peals of thunder.\r\n\r\nThe shrieking wind tossed the wreckage upon the angry, white-crested\r\nwaves which gleamed like the fangs of some devouring monster, and the\r\nrain descended in torrents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nASHORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Philip Garland again fully realized his situation he could hear,\r\nabove the roar of distant thunder, a continuous rumbling noise. Although\r\nnever having traveled on the sea very much, he understood that this dull\r\nbooming was caused by the surf, and he thought that the supreme moment\r\nhad come.\r\n\r\nThen he heard a deafening crash, from what cause he knew not. It\r\nwas as if a violent blow had been delivered full upon his head, and\r\nconsciousness again deserted him.\r\n\r\nOn opening his eyes it seemed as though he had been awakened from a\r\nprofound sleep. The sun beamed down from a blue, cloudless sky. He raised\r\nhimself and saw the ocean at his feet, but it was as placid as a lake.\r\n\r\nHe was lying on the wet beach, hardly three feet from where the waves\r\nwere rippling over the sand with a musical murmur, which afforded a vivid\r\ncontrast to their wild shrieking of the previous night.\r\n\r\nLooking around on every hand, not a vessel, boat or human face was to be\r\nseen. He was alone, so far as could be told from his limited range of\r\nvision, upon an uninhabited island.\r\n\r\nThe ill-fortune which began with the destruction of his establishment by\r\nMagog had surely spent itself in thus throwing him upon this tiny speck\r\nof land on the vast ocean, where, if any one should come, it would most\r\nlikely be those more implacable than the elements.\r\n\r\nPhilip knew, through books and from conversations with the captain of the\r\nSwallow, that since passing through the Straits of Sunda they were in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of pirates from Sooloo or Magindinao.\r\n\r\nEven the less warlike natives of the Archipelago were to be feared, for\r\nhe remembered at this moment better than ever before the writings of an\r\nold traveler, who says:\r\n\r\n    The inhabitants of these islands exceed every other people in\r\n    cruelty. They regard killing a man as a mere jest; nor is there\r\n    any punishment allotted for such a deed. If any one purchases\r\n    a new sword and wishes to try it, he will thrust it into the\r\n    breast of the first person he meets. The passers-by examine\r\n    the wound, and praise the skill of him who inflicted it if he\r\n    thrust in the weapon direct.\r\n\r\nIn this particular portion of the sea, where Philip had every reason to\r\nsuppose he was, the pirates have literally paralyzed trading on the water.\r\n\r\n    Every year these scourges of the Archipelago wander in one\r\n    direction or another, rendezvousing on some uninhabited island,\r\n    carrying devastation to all the small settlements around,\r\n    robbing, destroying, or taking captive every one they meet.\r\n    Their long, well-manned proas escape from the pursuit of\r\n    sailing vessels by pulling away right in the wind’s-eye; and\r\n    the warning smoke of a steamer generally enables them to hide\r\n    in some shallow bay, narrow river, or forest-covered inlet\r\n    until the danger is past.\r\n\r\nEven while the Swallow was at Batavia information had been received from\r\nBanda to the effect that the pirates were in the vicinity with a fleet of\r\nfifteen proas, attacking and destroying the villages, and carrying away\r\nwomen and children as slaves. Men they seldom or never hold as prisoners.\r\nThe thrust of a knife or a blow on the head with the butt of a musket\r\nserves to rid them of a troublesome captive.\r\n\r\nTwo days before the wreck the Swallow spoke a proa which had been\r\nattacked forty-eight hours previous. Three of the crew escaped in their\r\nsmall-boat and hid in the jungle of a neighboring island, while the\r\npirates killed the remainder and plundered the vessel.\r\n\r\nThese men reported the force as numbering sixteen large war-boats, and\r\nthe only blow struck by the traders in their own defence was when the\r\nfleet set sail, leaving a prize-crew of three on the dismantled proa. The\r\ncaptain, driven to desperation by his loss, swam off from the shore armed\r\nonly with his parang, or long knife, and coming upon them unawares made a\r\nfurious attack, killing one and wounding the others mortally.\r\n\r\nKnowing all this, it is not to be wondered at that Philip was filled\r\nwith dismay on finding himself alone upon an inhospitable shore.\r\n\r\nOne does not willingly submit to the embrace of death, however, and\r\nbefore resigning himself to what now seemed the inevitable he resolved to\r\nmake a last effort for life.\r\n\r\nWith this purpose in view he started toward the interior, but after\r\ntraveling a few moments his legs refused to obey his will.\r\n\r\nThe exhaustion caused by the previous night’s exposure and the intense\r\nheat so far prostrated him that he fell half-fainting at the foot of a\r\npalm-tree, whose cool and refreshing shade served to revive him so far\r\nthat in a short time he closed his eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke the sun was low in the heavens. He must have slept fully\r\neight hours.\r\n\r\nHis limbs were yet weary, and his eyes heavy from the profound sleep. In\r\norder to dissipate the lethargy which hung over him he arose to his feet,\r\nwalking rapidly forward.\r\n\r\nSuddenly from the thicket directly in front of him he heard what sounded\r\nvery like a human voice crying “Wawk, wawk, wawk!”\r\n\r\nThis was so nearly a command in his own language that Philip ran forward\r\neagerly, fancying for the moment that he was about to see a white man,\r\nwhen the whirring of wings and a quick passage of gorgeous plumage\r\nagainst the dark green foliage told he had made the acquaintance for the\r\nfirst time of a great Bird-of-Paradise, which is to be found only in this\r\nportion of the world.\r\n\r\nIt was a large male, radiant in all the brilliant plumage which renders\r\nits skin such a valuable article of merchandise. The wings and tail were\r\nof a rich dark brown, the breast a deep violet, and the head and neck\r\nof a delicate yellow, the feathers being so short and close set as to\r\nresemble velvet. The lower part of the eyes was a vivid green, while the\r\nback and feet were pale blue.\r\n\r\nThe two middle feathers of the tail were what gave a striking appearance\r\nto this winged beauty. They were nearly a yard long, the extreme ends\r\ncurving into a complete circle.\r\n\r\nNever before had Philip seen even the skin of one of these rare birds,\r\nand forgetting all his troubles, he watched its flight in mute admiration.\r\n\r\nIt was to be his good fortune, while in this wretched condition of both\r\nbody and mind, to see what few except the natives of the Archipelago have\r\never had the pleasure of witnessing-a party of feathered dancers all clad\r\nin the same gorgeous plumage as the one he had just startled.\r\n\r\nPushing forward softly among the foliage to catch one more glimpse of\r\nthose curling orange feathers, he saw a dozen or twenty full-plumaged\r\nmales on a stout limb, raising and dropping their wings, stretching their\r\nnecks, and vibrating their delicately-tinted coats as if really engaged\r\nin some species of terpsichorean festivities, while now and then they\r\ndarted from branch to branch until it appeared that the entire tree was\r\nfilled with waving plumes.\r\n\r\nIt is at such a time as this that the bird-hunter secures his richest\r\nprizes, and with comparative ease.\r\n\r\nWhen the Malays find a tree which the birds have fixed upon as their\r\ndancing-place, a little shelter of palm leaves is built near the trunk\r\namong the branches, and in it before daylight the hunter hides himself,\r\narmed with a bow and several arrows which terminate in a rough knob. At\r\nthe foot of the tree another hunter is concealed. When the dance has\r\nbegun the native above shoots his blunt arrow with such force as to stun\r\nthe bird, who is secured and killed by the one on the ground without its\r\nplumage being injured by a drop of blood. The others pay no attention\r\nto this sudden disappearance of their companion, and the slaughter is\r\ncontinued until the greater number of the birds are slain.\r\n\r\nPhilip gazed at this rare and beautiful sight nearly a quarter of an\r\nhour, and then, as if suddenly remembering his own necessities, he pushed\r\nforward once more among the matted and tangled underbrush.\r\n\r\nBefore twenty yards had been traversed the glimpse of a moving object\r\namong the trees caused him to utter a cry of joy. He had seen that which\r\nbore close resemblance to a human form, and quite naturally he believed\r\nit to be some inhabitant of the island.\r\n\r\nRunning at full speed, urged to put forth every effort by the belief that\r\nhe would soon find aid, food and shelter, no inconsiderable distance was\r\ntraversed during the next ten minutes. To his most intense surprise,\r\nhowever, he failed to see again this figure which had so raised hope, or\r\neven to discover in what direction it fled.\r\n\r\nDisheartened, and fancying his eyes had deceived him, he continued to\r\nmake his way forward; but not with the same energy as before. He became\r\nlike one who toils without hope of a happy conclusion to the labor.\r\n\r\nCourage revived again however when, on emerging from the thicket of palms\r\nthrough which he had been making his way to a more open portion of the\r\nforest, the same figure stood revealed to view.\r\n\r\nPhilip now watched with the utmost attention, and was surprised at the\r\nwonderful celerity of the stranger’s movements. He disappeared and then\r\nappeared again, passing from one point to another much more rapidly than\r\nany person could have run, and in many ways gave such evidence of fear\r\nthat the shipwrecked young man advanced yet more boldly.\r\n\r\nUpon arriving at the place where the supposed native had last been seen,\r\nPhilip was startled, almost frightened, as the object of his search\r\nsuddenly descended from the top of a tree at his very feet.\r\n\r\nIt was an ape!\r\n\r\nWith one bound the animal mounted the tree again, then leaped down, and\r\nfinally placed himself immediately in Philip’s path, as if to prevent him\r\nfrom proceeding.\r\n\r\nOne trained as Philip Garland had been could feel but little fear of\r\nsuch an animal. He broke a branch from the nearest tree, and raising it\r\nwith a threatening gesture stepped forward.\r\n\r\nThis movement aroused the animal to anger. He retreated a few steps,\r\nuttering loud, shrill cries, which were evidently intended as signals\r\nto his companions in the vicinity; and, as a result, troop upon troop\r\nof apes came from every side through the openings in the forest. They\r\nwere of all colors and sizes, and clambered up the trees, ran along\r\nthe branches like squirrels, or, taking a stand about the stranger,\r\nthreatened him with their glances and gestures as they uttered hissing\r\ncries, or gnashed their teeth with such a deafening noise that the\r\ntraveler grew positively bewildered.\r\n\r\nBetter than any one else did Philip understand the vicious nature of\r\nthese animals when gathered in such numbers, and he knew full well that\r\nto save his life retreat was necessary.\r\n\r\nThis thought came too late, however. On every side were closely-packed\r\nranks of apes, some of whom appeared to be as strong as gorillas, and the\r\nfirst movement toward escape might be the signal for his death.\r\n\r\nPhilip had in his pocket a small revolver, placed there during the\r\nmutiny on the Swallow; but of what avail would it be to kill five of his\r\nadversaries when they could be numbered by hundreds, and had hemmed him\r\nin so closely?\r\n\r\nAn attempt at flight would be as foolhardy as any effort toward\r\nintimidation. The only course which could be pursued with the slightest\r\nchance of success was to remain silent and motionless.\r\n\r\nWith one hand inside the breast of his coat, clutching the weapon he was\r\nresolved to use only when death seemed inevitable, he stood immovable as\r\nthe animals crowded nearer.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the outer circle of apes began to chatter, as if they\r\nwere discussing some new aspect of the affair which had presented itself,\r\nand a moment later the entire party suddenly began to leap to and fro,\r\nmaking the most hostile demonstrations.\r\n\r\nThe branch which Philip had broken from the tree was lying on the ground\r\ndirectly at his feet, and with a quick movement one of the animals seized\r\nit. Before he had time to place himself in a position of defense, or even\r\nto draw his weapon, the ape showered blow after blow on his arms, legs,\r\nface and head in such rapid succession that he could not avoid them.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to remain passive under such a castigation, and also\r\nvery humiliating, for one whose business had been the training of\r\nmonkeys, to receive punishment from members of the same tribe he had so\r\noften flogged; but under the circumstances there was no alternative.\r\n\r\nAt the first blow the apes gave way, much as a party of men might who\r\nform a ring for two pugilists, and from their points of vantage evinced\r\nthe most profound delight. A crowd of boys could hardly have shown more\r\npleasure at the flogging of some obnoxious pedagogue and Philip’s anger\r\nalmost blinded his prudence.\r\n\r\nDuring fully ten minutes the punishment, was continued without\r\nintermission, and it might have resulted fatally to the unfortunate\r\nanimal-trader if he had not bethought himself of past experiences, when\r\nhe was master and apes were forced to receive his blows.\r\n\r\nAround his neck he wore a blue silk handkerchief after the fashion of\r\nsailors, and this he untied quickly, throwing it among the crowd of\r\nspectators, knowing full well that any bright color will attract apes\r\nmore readily than food or noise.\r\n\r\nIn an instant the decorous assemblage had resolved themselves into a\r\nshrieking, howling mob. They rushed toward the one who had been so\r\nfortunate as to secure the prize, each trying in turn to seize it,\r\nchattering and screaming until the din was absolutely deafening. He who\r\nhad played the part of castigator followed the example of the others, and\r\nfrom a friendly contest it soon became a veritable fight, during which\r\nthere was but little question that the object of their desires would be\r\ntorn into shreds.\r\n\r\nThis was Philip’s opportunity. Not one of the combatants was paying the\r\nslightest attention to him, and after stealing softly through the foliage\r\nuntil the apes were shut out from view, he ran toward the interior of the\r\nisland at full speed.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that Philip’s flight through the thicket was\r\nattended with no more inconvenience than would be the case in an\r\nAmerican forest. Almost every shrub and tree was infested with small\r\nblack ants, and as the fugitive brushed past they loosened their hold on\r\nthe foliage to literally take possession of his body.\r\n\r\nBefore running a hundred yards his face and neck were covered, and he\r\ncould feel them on every inch of his skin, as they bit with a sharpness\r\nwhich seemed like the prick of a huge needle.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these pests, which were very painful, there was a species\r\nof blue-bottle fly, so numerous that the buzzing sounded like the humming\r\nof bees; and when they alighted on Philip’s body it was with difficulty\r\nhe brushed them off, for their legs seemed to contain deposits of glue,\r\nwhich held them firmly in place until sometimes it was necessary to\r\nactually dismember them.\r\n\r\nHis skin soon became a mass of blotches, for the poison of the insects\r\ncaused the wounds to swell like boils, and it was no longer possible to\r\ndistinguish his features.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nDISAGREEABLE NEIGHBORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip continued his flight, regardless either of fatigue or the insects,\r\nthrough the brambles which tore his flesh until, on passing half-around\r\na slight elevation which was covered with a greenish white moss, he came\r\nupon a lake fully a mile in length, and bordered by tall trees.\r\n\r\nAs nearly as could be judged he had traveled at least three miles, and in\r\nthis secluded and lovely spot, which was so surrounded by foliage as to\r\nrender it impossible for him to peer into the thicket further than two or\r\nthree feet, it surely seemed as if he was safe from his late tormentors.\r\n\r\nThe sensation of thirst was by this time so intense as to be almost\r\npainful, and the sight of the clear, sparkling water revived his spirits\r\nto a wonderful degree.\r\n\r\nRunning forward eagerly, he knelt on the soft turf at the edge of the\r\nlake, and remained in that position ten or fifteen minutes, drinking at\r\nintervals like one at a feast who is satisfied but delays leaving the\r\nfestive-board because of the enjoyment of looking at the delicacies.\r\n\r\nWith his thirst assuaged Philip’s hopes revived. He believed it would be\r\npossible to avoid the apes on an island of such extent as this appeared\r\nto be; and when he finally raised his head it was to look about him for\r\nthe purpose of deciding in which direction he would find refuge and\r\nshelter for the night.\r\n\r\nAs he did so, however, a cry of dismay burst from his lips. On either\r\nhand for a distance of many yards were the very apes from whom he was\r\ntrying to escape. All were kneeling as he knelt, and raising their heads\r\nexactly as he raised his, with the water running in streams from their\r\nmuzzles.\r\n\r\nNo doubt they followed him through the thicket, or made their way\r\noverhead among the branches; but since the stick with which he had\r\nthreatened them was not in sight, all idea of punishing the intruder was\r\nforgotten. Their faculties of imitation proved greater than the love for\r\nmischief, and thus, while he congratulated himself upon having escaped,\r\nthey had gathered noiselessly around him.\r\n\r\nHowever dangerous the animal-trader’s position, he could not restrain a\r\nloud burst of laughter at the grotesque scene before him; but his mirth\r\nwas very quickly turned to surprise when he heard the sounds of his own\r\nvoice echoed from five hundred pairs of lungs.\r\n\r\nThis mockery aroused still further his mirth, and he laughed yet louder,\r\nthe apes redoubling their efforts until it seemed as if each hairy throat\r\nwas swollen almost to bursting.\r\n\r\nIt was an orchestra of the tropics with a leader who had no pride in the\r\nachievements of his subordinates.\r\n\r\nAs Philip sat up on his heels so did the animals, and with their heads\r\nraised high in their effort to emulate what they possibly thought was a\r\nsong, a bright blue object around the throats of fifteen or twenty of the\r\nlarger apes attracted the shipwrecked boy’s attention.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly probable that the long-tailed denizens of the woods were\r\neducated to the fashion of wearing neckties, but yet there could be no\r\nquestion that these select few had on such an article of adornment.\r\nNot until after several moments did Philip understand how prominent a\r\npart his own neckerchief was playing in the scene. Each of the apes\r\nthus decorated had secured a fragment of the cravat, and, true to their\r\nimitative instincts, tied it around his neck.\r\n\r\nNow that his strange companions were in apparently such a friendly mood,\r\nPhilip thought it possible, by abstaining from any threatening movements,\r\nto get on with some degree of comfort, even though they still continued\r\nto surround him.\r\n\r\nTo sleep just then was out of the question, for the smaller members\r\nof the party were yet struggling to laugh, and he looked around for\r\nsomething with which to appease his hunger, which had increased very\r\ndecidedly since his thirst was satisfied.\r\n\r\nHe gazed scrutinizingly along the borders of the lake, hoping to see at\r\nleast some fresh-water mussels. The apes did the same, although probably\r\nnot with a similar hope.\r\n\r\nHis eyes roamed among the foliage. So did those of his companions. He\r\nsaw on a number of trees near the water fruit of a bright yellow color,\r\nresembling a crab-apple in shape. If the apes observed the same they made\r\nno mention of the fact.\r\n\r\nThe trees were at least two hundred feet tall, with branches shooting\r\nfrom their very tops, and to climb up these smooth trunks, where there\r\nwas not the slightest support for either hand or foot, was an utter\r\nimpossibility.\r\n\r\nTo throw a stone so high with any degree of accuracy would be rather a\r\ndifficult matter; but yet Philip resolved to try it. The shore of the\r\nlake in certain places was covered with small, sharp, flint-like stones,\r\nand thus there was plenty of ammunition at hand, even if he should be\r\nforced to try very many times before succeeding.\r\n\r\nThe first shot was not a success. The stone, after striking the trunk of\r\nthe tree a few feet below the branches, bounded among the foliage with a\r\nloud noise.\r\n\r\nThe apes, who had been intently watching all his movements, hardly waited\r\nuntil the stone reached the ground before the entire party gathered\r\narmfuls of stones and began to fling them at the topmost branches,\r\ncausing the leaves and fruit to fly in every direction.\r\n\r\nThe smaller animals, who could not send the missiles so high, formed\r\na chain, and passing the ammunition from hand to hand, supplied those\r\nwho were more skillful, until that particular portion of the forest was\r\nalmost entirely denuded of its foliage.\r\n\r\nImpelled by his hunger Philip seized a handful of the small fruits, which\r\nwere evidently a species of guava, and began to eat eagerly.\r\n\r\nAt that instant the army of stone-throwers ceased their labor as each\r\ngathered a supply of fruit, and began eating exactly as did their\r\nhuman companion. When he raised one of the guavas to his mouth they\r\nimitated his exact movement. When he chewed they worked their jaws most\r\nindustriously. When he ejected a seed from his mouth a perfect shower\r\nof seeds fell upon the sand. If he threw away a stem they repeated the\r\naction; and when, by chance, he made a smacking noise with his lips,\r\nthe shore of the lake resounded with such a snapping and clattering of\r\njaws as would have caused the “end-man” of a minstrel troupe to grow\r\nexceedingly green with envy.\r\n\r\nThe abundant harvest which, when it was first gathered, gave promise of\r\nsupplying Philip with food for many days, was disposed of in a very few\r\nmoments. Before his hunger was satisfied the last guava had disappeared,\r\nand the army of apes looked up expectantly, wondering what was to be the\r\nnext move in this queer sport.\r\n\r\nIt may seem comical to have one’s every gesture repeated by four or five\r\nhundred long-tailed, human-like animals, but it soon becomes annoying, to\r\nuse the mildest term.\r\n\r\nDuring fully fifteen minutes Philip sat silent and motionless, not daring\r\nso much as to raise his finger lest ten or twelve hundred fingers should\r\nbe pointed toward him; and his companions observed the same immobility.\r\n\r\nThe approach of night, which comes on so rapidly in the tropics, gave\r\nhim plenty of food for reflection as he sat there surrounded by his\r\nstatue-like companions. To remain in the forest during the hours of\r\ndarkness with such a following was something that filled him with dread,\r\nfor it was impossible to say at what moment their capricious fancies\r\nmight lead to another attack, and he racked his brain in vain for some\r\nanswer to the vexed question.\r\n\r\nHe had every reason to believe that during the next day he should find\r\nhuman beings who, however unfriendly, would at least relieve him of this\r\nthrong of attendants, for the island was apparently so large that it\r\nseemed hardly probable it was uninhabited. Thus, according to his belief,\r\nthe only difficulties to be encountered were from this time until morning.\r\n\r\nBut how and where should the night be passed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nA SINGULAR DISAPPEARANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe length of time which Philip remained motionless caused the apes to\r\nshow signs of the greatest discontent. In their monkey minds there was\r\nno sport in thus sitting like statues, and two of the largest decided to\r\nmake matters more agreeable to themselves if not to their human companion.\r\n\r\nHe continued to sit under the shade of the palm-tree where the feast\r\nhad been brought to such an abrupt conclusion by the rapid consumption\r\nof the eatables, and these two leaders approached in a manner which was\r\nevidently friendly, but at the same time most inquisitive.\r\n\r\nThey first smelled of him, touched his hands, face and hair, and\r\nproceeded on the work of examination down to his feet, where they\r\nsuddenly discovered that the shoes were not a portion of his body.\r\n\r\nWith a scream of delight one of the examiners removed the foot-covering,\r\nand then evinced the most profound astonishment at being able to take off\r\nthe stockings also.\r\n\r\nThe shipwrecked man’s toes next attracted his attention, and he amused\r\nhimself by moving them back and forth, evidently wondering why this\r\nstranger should be formed almost as perfectly as himself.\r\n\r\nThe other ape, chagrined at not having made as important a discovery as\r\nhis companion, now gave the most profound attention to Philip’s trousers,\r\ncatching hold of the lower portion and attempting to pull them off.\r\n\r\nHow to check these investigations, which might be more than inconvenient\r\nwhen the main body of apes should consider it their duty to take part in\r\nthe operation, was what Philip could not decide, as, when he stood in\r\nthe midst of the throng during the first meeting, he dared not make any\r\nthreatening gestures; and it is very probable he would speedily have been\r\ndisrobed had not several of the spectators strenuously objected to the\r\ntwo leaders monopolizing all the sport.\r\n\r\nThis objection was first shown when a dozen of the party began pulling at\r\nPhilip’s coat and vest, some even going so far as to fancy his hair might\r\nbe easily removed, and dragging out large handfuls by the roots. Before\r\nfive minutes had elapsed another squad marched up to perform their part\r\nin the entertainment.\r\n\r\nOwing to the inability of all to participate in the sport, these last\r\nseemed to consider it a solemn duty to prevent their companions from\r\nenjoying themselves, and then ensued a rough-and-tumble fight in which\r\nPhilip certainly played the part of “under dog.”\r\n\r\nThey screamed, tugged, pulled, and yelled over his prostrate body without\r\neither side gaining the mastery, and although he received many bruises\r\nand scratches, it was preferable to being entirely disrobed, or to seeing\r\nhis garments decorating the bodies of his antagonists or companions,\r\nwhichever we may call them.\r\n\r\nHad he remained immovable much longer his clothes would speedily have\r\nbeen torn into shreds by the yelling, scrambling crew around him; and to\r\nlose this artificial covering in a forest through which one could not\r\nwalk without being seriously wounded by the brambles would be almost\r\nas fatal as a desperate encounter. Therefore, for the first time since\r\nmeeting these strange inhabitants he decided to stand upon the defensive.\r\n\r\nBy dint of much pushing and pulling, and at the expense of many\r\nscratches, he succeeded in extricating himself from the combatants, but\r\nonly to be confronted by a fresh force of assailants, who were lingering\r\non the outside of the struggling crowd. These, following the example\r\nof their leaders, seemed to consider it the proper thing to engage him\r\nin battle, and in a very few seconds it became absolutely necessary to\r\ndefend himself with force.\r\n\r\n“It’s death if I don’t shoot, and it can be no worse if I kill four or\r\nfive; besides, the report of the revolver may frighten them,” he said to\r\nhimself as, backing against a gigantic palm-tree, he drew and leveled the\r\nweapon directly at the foremost ape.\r\n\r\nHis position at this moment was most critical. That he would be torn\r\nin pieces as had been his cravat, after shooting the first ape, seemed\r\ninevitable; but he said grimly, between his set teeth:\r\n\r\n“It is better to die while fighting than to yield without a struggle,”\r\nand he took deliberate aim.\r\n\r\nAnother second and the weapon would have been discharged, unless, indeed,\r\nas was quite possible, its long immersion in the sea had rendered it\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nJust as he was on the point of pressing the trigger a terrific shriek,\r\nsuch as it would hardly seem could have come from any pair of lungs,\r\nhowever vigorous, was heard some distance in the rear, and was prolonged\r\nuntil the echoes sent it rolling down the lake like detonations of\r\nthunder.\r\n\r\nPhilip stared about him in alarm, trying in vain to discover the meaning\r\nof this strange noise, and to his great astonishment the crowd of apes\r\nstarted with the rapidity of the wind in the direction from which the\r\nshriek had come.\r\n\r\nOn every hand among the foliage could be seen for one brief second the\r\ndisappearing tails of his troublesome companions, and then he was left\r\nalone, the tumult in the distance growing fainter and fainter, as this\r\narmy of animals dispersed at the highest rate of speed, until finally all\r\nwas hushed and still.\r\n\r\nHe was alone on the border of the lake. Silence and solitude had in the\r\ntwinkling of an eye replaced the frightful tumult, and the shadows of\r\nnight were closing rapidly around him.\r\n\r\nUtter despair gave way to hope. Now that he was alone, the possible\r\ndangers to be encountered in the forest during the hours of darkness were\r\nas nothing compared to the relief he felt at having lost sight of the\r\ngrinning, chattering apes.\r\n\r\nIt might be possible to find human beings before the mantle of night\r\nhad been fully spread over the land, and he made his preparations for\r\ncontinuing the tramp as calmly as if his life had never been threatened.\r\nThe most important task was to regain possession of his shoes and\r\nstockings, for without them it would be a matter of impossibility to walk\r\na hundred yards, and he began the most careful search on the scene of the\r\nlate encounter.\r\n\r\nWhen, after not more than five minutes’ hunt, the missing and highly\r\nnecessary articles were found, he accepted it as a good omen, and was\r\nalmost convinced that he would soon have food and shelter among human\r\nbeings. This belief was strengthened by the terrific shriek which brought\r\nthe battle of the apes to such a sudden end. He felt positive that the\r\nnoise had been made by some contrivance of man’s, although why the apes\r\nrushed directly toward it was what he could not explain.\r\n\r\nFrom among the branches cut off when the animals were bombarding the\r\ntrees he selected the stoutest one as a cane, as well as an additional\r\nweapon of defense, and then started around the lake, hoping to find\r\nthe outlet, which must necessarily flow into the sea, before it became\r\nnecessary to halt for the night.\r\n\r\nAt this place, if anywhere, would he come upon the inhabitants of the\r\nisland; and as his late tormentors might return at any moment after\r\nsunrise—it was hardly probable they would do so during the night—time\r\nmust be economized at the risk of meeting with wild animals in the jungle.\r\n\r\nFollowing along the shore of the lake for fully half an hour, he met with\r\nno obstacles save where the foliage came in a matted tangle close to the\r\nwater, and then the sound as of a cascade fell upon his ears.\r\n\r\nHe had arrived at the destination set; but not content to remain here,\r\nalthough the darkness was almost impenetrable, he continued on down the\r\nbank of this waterfall until arriving at a second, ending in a basin from\r\nwhich, contrary to his expectations, flowed a stream of considerable size.\r\n\r\nIt was evident the coast was further away than he had fancied; and weary\r\nin limb as well as sore in body he halted for the night.\r\n\r\nThe sleep that came to his eyelids was neither profound nor refreshing.\r\nHe made for himself such a bed as could be formed of leaves and moss; but\r\non lying down, the strangeness of his surroundings and the fear of what\r\nmight be lurking in the darkness prevented his eyes from closing many\r\nmoments at a time.\r\n\r\nIt was a relief rather than otherwise when the surrounding objects began\r\nto stand out from a background of violet, and he knew the coming day was\r\nsending heralds abroad to announce its near approach.\r\n\r\nA welcome breeze, the accompaniment of sunrise, swept across the jungle,\r\ncooling his fevered brow, and the fact that it was not heated caused him\r\nto believe the sea but a short distance away. As he arose to his feet,\r\nfollowing the conformation of the stream, the thicket became less dense,\r\nand the foliage so scanty that one could see many yards ahead, until,\r\nwhen the sun showed itself above the horizon, not two hundred yards off\r\nthe waves of the boundless ocean were revealed to view.\r\n\r\nTo his disappointment there were no signs of inhabitants; but it might be\r\npossible a village was located further up on the shore, and he made his\r\nway along the beach, halting at every sound in the thicket, fearing his\r\nold enemies might be in pursuit.\r\n\r\nDuring the first hour he saw nothing to encourage, save it might be in\r\nthe thousands of oysters which were spread out on the beach, a goodly\r\nportion of which had been opened, not naturally, but with the aid of a\r\nlittle stone placed between the shells.\r\n\r\nPhilip knew that this must be a favorite feeding-ground for such\r\ninhabitants of the island as he had already met. Oysters are a luxury\r\nto the entire monkey tribe, who succeed in procuring the bivalves by a\r\nvariety of cunning means, the most common of which is to throw a stone\r\nbetween the shells when the oyster chances to be open. In this manner\r\nthey are sure of their prey without having to run the risk of getting\r\ntheir paws or muzzles caught in the powerful grip of the shell-fish.\r\n\r\nSome monkeys, as Philip knew from what he had read on the subject,\r\nparticularly those of Burmah, open the oyster with a stone by striking\r\nthe base of the upper valve until it dislocates or breaks, and then\r\nextract the meat with their fingers, occasionally putting the shell\r\nstraight to their mouths.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of observing and understanding every object in his path,\r\nfor the purpose of learning as much as possible concerning the island,\r\ncaused the traveler to scan these shells carefully. The fact that monkeys\r\nare adept oyster-openers had no interest for him, save as it was the\r\nmeans of showing that human beings had not visited this portion of the\r\nshore; therefore he understood it would be necessary to look elsewhere\r\nfor aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nA PERILOUS PREDICAMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot having had guavas sufficient for anything more than the lightest kind\r\nof a light lunch, the shipwrecked youth searched among the shells for\r\noysters. It was a laborious way of earning a dinner, since the monkeys\r\nhad cleaned out the meats pretty thoroughly, and an hour’s hard work did\r\nnot reward him with more than a dozen of the tiny bivalves.\r\n\r\nHis hunger was so great that he would have continued this almost futile\r\nsearch longer, but for the fact that the sun was sending an intense\r\nheat down upon the exposed beach, and already had he begun to feel the\r\ngreatest inconvenience, and even pain. Prostration, if nothing worse,\r\nwould most surely follow, unless he beat a speedy retreat.\r\n\r\nTo regain the shelter of the woods was absolutely necessary despite the\r\ndesire for food; but before doing so Philip believed it of the highest\r\nimportance that he should contrive some signal which might possibly\r\nattract the attention of those on board passing vessels.\r\n\r\nThe means for doing such work were limited, yet he did succeed in raising\r\nwhat might, perhaps, be seen half a mile away, although knowing full\r\nwell that no trading-vessels would venture so near the inhospitable\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nCutting the straightest and tallest stick of bamboo which could be found\r\nwithin a distance of a hundred yards, he stripped it of the leaves, and\r\nto the top fastened one of the two white handkerchiefs he had about him\r\nat the time of the shipwreck. This feeble attempt at a signal was planted\r\nfirmly in the sand, and by the expenditure of considerable labor he\r\nheaped around the base a huge quantity of shells.\r\n\r\nAs far up and down the shore as the eye could reach a line of reef\r\nextended fully a quarter of a mile into the sea, and it was with a\r\nfeeling of despondency that he looked at the fruits of his labor, knowing\r\nthere was but little chance the fluttering cloth could bring any one to\r\nhis relief.\r\n\r\nTo continue the journey around the coast would be to expose himself\r\nto the direct rays of the sun, and inasmuch as the reef precluded the\r\npossibility of a settlement in the vicinity, Philip determined to make\r\nhis way directly across the island.\r\n\r\nTo that end he went straight into the underbrush toward the south,\r\nkeeping careful watch on every hand lest he should be surprised by any\r\nof his former monkey acquaintances, and at the expiration of an hour was\r\nclambering up the side of a rocky elevation.\r\n\r\nOf course it would have been possible to travel around the base of this\r\nhill, but the hope that from the summit he might obtain a good view of\r\nthe odd land on which he had been thrown caused him to court rather than\r\navoid labor.\r\n\r\nWhile making his way through the trees, pausing now and then to brush\r\naway the insects which rendered every movement so painful, he saw\r\ndescending from a palm what he mistook for a flying-squirrel. With but\r\nlittle hope that he could succeed in capturing this tiny game, which\r\nwould make a tempting lunch for one in his half-famished condition, he\r\ndarted forward.\r\n\r\nThere was no difficulty in catching the supposed squirrel, for it proved\r\nto be anything rather than active in its movements, and as Philip’s\r\nfingers clutched the body he found to his surprise that he had seized a\r\nhuge frog whose deep green skin looked, in the dim light, so much like\r\nfur.\r\n\r\nNaturalist though he was, Philip had never before seen such a specimen as\r\nthis. The toes were very long and webbed at their extremities, so that\r\nupon being expanded they presented a surface much larger than the body.\r\nThe fore-legs were also bordered by a membrane, and it was evident the\r\nfrog was inflated during the leap, for he shrank to one-half his previous\r\nsize immediately the hunter grasped him.\r\n\r\nThere could be no mistake but that this was the veritable flying-frog of\r\nthe Malay Archipelago, and Philip examined it with great interest. The\r\nback and legs were of a deep green, while the under-surface was yellow,\r\nas were also the webs of the feet, each of which covered a surface of\r\nabout four square inches. The extremities of the toes were formed\r\nsimilar to those of a tree-frog, and it is probable the membrane was\r\nintended to be used as often for swimming as for flying.\r\n\r\nIt was not a particularly dainty morsel of food, however, and after\r\nsatisfying his curiosity concerning it Philip set the little fellow at\r\nliberty, he continuing on up the difficult ascent.\r\n\r\nHe expended his strength uselessly in climbing the hill, however, for\r\nwhen the highest point of the elevation had been gained it was not\r\npossible to see anything above the surrounding trees. His fatigue and\r\ndisappointment might have caused him to give way in despair if, just at\r\nthe moment when his mental troubles were greatest, he had not observed\r\na small animal, evidently some species of deer, about two hundred yards\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe desire for food now outweighed all other considerations, and he crept\r\nforward among the scanty foliage with his revolver in hand, hoping a\r\nchance shot might supply him with a dinner.\r\n\r\nWhen it was no longer possible to approach without danger of being seen,\r\nhe took careful aim over the top of a bowlder and discharged two barrels\r\nof his weapon in rapid succession.\r\n\r\nThe deer sprang into the air and then staggered forward; but instead of\r\nfalling, as the hunter so ardently desired, he started down the sharp\r\ndescent on the south side of the hill.\r\n\r\nPhilip forgot his fatigue and pursued, taking a course at right-angles\r\nwith the one made by the animal, in order to intercept him at the point\r\nof bushes which was evidently his destination.\r\n\r\nWith his eye fixed on the deer, noting not the nature of the ground over\r\nwhich he traveled, Philip rushed forward, gaining rapidly on his prey. At\r\nthe objective point of foliage the animal halted for an instant, and the\r\nhunter bent every energy toward increasing his speed.\r\n\r\nWhen his pursuer was hardly three yards away the deer disappeared, and\r\nthinking he had merely taken refuge behind the bushes, Philip darted\r\naround the other side, only to stop suddenly as he saw a chasm yawning\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nHe attempted to check himself so suddenly that a small stone was loosened\r\nunder his foot, throwing him forward with still greater impetus, and it\r\nbecame impossible to regain a foot-hold.\r\n\r\nAt the very edge of the precipice he clutched wildly at what seemed to\r\nbe a bush, as he was literally hurled among the branches. This slight\r\nsupport gave way beneath his weight, and he dropped his revolver to seize\r\nwith both hands the trunk of the bush.\r\n\r\nDown, down he went, seemingly a great distance, but still holding on\r\nfor dear life; and then the foliage swung upward again in the rebound,\r\ncarrying him with it, as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nHanging like an apple on a limb, he swayed to and fro, up and down, until\r\nthe trunk upon which his very life depended had settled into nearly a\r\nstationary position.\r\n\r\nNow it could be seen that he had dropped hardly more than twenty\r\nfeet from the brow of the cliff; but this was not exactly cheering\r\ninformation, for he was hanging over a sheer descent of thirty or forty\r\nyards. That which he had mistaken for a bush was simply the upper portion\r\nof a reasonably large tree which grew on a shelf of the rock ten or\r\ntwelve feet below the crest of the ledge.\r\n\r\nHe was grasping the trunk within three or four feet of the very top, and\r\nhis weight made a tremendous strain upon the root. The wood was tough,\r\nhowever, and fortunately for him he bent so far from the cliff as to be\r\nsuspended almost at right-angles with it.\r\n\r\nThese points were noted with the quickness of thought at the same time\r\nthat a plan for saving himself came like a flash of light into his mind.\r\n\r\nBefore the strain on his arms should grow too great he determined to pull\r\nhimself along the trunk like an acrobat on a horizontal bar. He could not\r\ndo this, however, without causing the tree to sway violently again, and\r\nit became necessary to throw one leg over the yielding wood, where he\r\nhung in imminent danger not only of slipping off, but of being carried\r\ndown the precipice together with that which he clutched so desperately,\r\nfor it was only a question of time before the roots would be torn from\r\ntheir slight hold.\r\n\r\nTherefore it became essential that the attempt at escape should be made\r\nin another direction.\r\n\r\nCarefully letting himself down until he was once more in the first\r\nposition, he worked his way, with every muscle strained to its utmost\r\ntension, hand over hand toward the roots, impeded by twigs and branches\r\nuntil the task seemed well-nigh impossible.\r\n\r\nEach inch gained in this direction caused the tree to resume more\r\nnearly its original position, until when he was a little more than half\r\nway toward the base the trunk stood upright, and by dropping down he\r\nsucceeded in reaching the narrow ledge, from which to gain the top of the\r\ncliff was a reasonably easy task.\r\n\r\nWhen Philip was once more in a place of safety it became necessary to\r\nrest his weary limbs before going in search of the game that had so\r\nnearly cost him his life. Lying prone upon the earth for fifteen minutes\r\nwas sufficient to give him the required strength, and then he began to\r\nsearch for a practicable path to the foot of the precipice.\r\n\r\nA detour of a quarter of a mile was sufficient to take him from the edge\r\nof the cliff to the rocky side of the hill, down which it was possible to\r\nmake his way without any great difficulty.\r\n\r\nDespite the pangs of hunger his first care was the revolver, and he\r\nfollowed up the narrow ravine or gully, which was thickly overgrown with\r\nshrubs, until he stood directly beneath the tree which had saved him from\r\na terrible fall. Here he searched the ground in vain, and was about to\r\ngive up the task to find the trail of the deer when glancing, by chance,\r\nalong the side of the cliff, he saw the weapon lodged in the branches of\r\na stout sapling, while not more than thirty feet distant was an immense\r\npanther standing over the mangled carcass of the game.\r\n\r\nSurely he was between the horns of a dilemma now. Both his revolver and\r\nthe postponed dinner were so near the ferocious animal that it would be\r\nas dangerous to make any attempt at getting one as the other, and during\r\nseveral moments he stood undecided, knowing that the first step taken in\r\nretreat would bring the beast upon him.\r\n\r\nA youth less versed in the habits of wild animals than Philip Garland\r\nmight unwittingly have brought on an encounter to which there could be\r\nbut one end. He, however, remained motionless, save as he worked his way,\r\ninch by inch, toward a thicket of shrubs without lifting his feet from\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nEven this stealthy retreat was noted by the animal, who began to twitch\r\nits tail as if preparing for a leap, and the shipwrecked youth knew he\r\ncould no longer hold the enemy by his gaze nor gain the desired shelter.\r\nThere was little opportunity for further preparation. The panther was\r\nalready crouching for the spring.\r\n\r\nMentally bracing himself for that which seemed inevitable, he awaited\r\nthe supreme moment with but one faint hope in his mind—that it might be\r\npossible to jump aside while the animal was in the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nA TERRIBLE FIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust at the instant when Philip Garland believed his career as a trader\r\nin wild animals was to be ended by death the panther turned his head\r\nslightly and began to paw up the leaves, his tail moving angrily from\r\nside to side, much as if an adversary was approaching from the opposite\r\ndirection. At the same moment was heard a fierce growling and snarling\r\nfrom the left, a short distance away, followed immediately by the sound\r\nof claws raking the bark as this new-comer evidently sprang into a tree.\r\n\r\nThere was now an opportunity for the shipwrecked youth to make his\r\nescape; but the fascination of the scene held him spell-bound.\r\n\r\nThe panther, who had been standing guard over the deer, crouched for an\r\ninstant with every muscle quivering, and then leaped high in the air as\r\na huge body shot from out the foliage with the force and velocity of a\r\ncannon-ball, the two animals coming together with a shock several feet\r\nfrom the ground.\r\n\r\nThe combatants rolled over and over, snarling like cats, full twenty\r\npaces from where the revolver hung suspended, and Philip moved cautiously\r\nforward without being observed by either of the participants in the\r\ndeadly strife.\r\n\r\nA moment later he had secured the weapon, and made his way with\r\nconsiderable difficulty up the side of the cliff until he arrived at a\r\nstout but not tall tree, within view of the animals. To ascend the trunk\r\nof this was but the work of a moment, and he seated himself among the\r\nbranches to await the result of the sanguinary battle.\r\n\r\nOver and over the two panthers rolled, snarling and tearing at each\r\nother’s throats as they uttered from time to time such roars as seemingly\r\ncaused the very air to tremble.\r\n\r\nDuring fully fifteen minutes these huge cats tore and slashed, each\r\ngripping his adversary’s neck, and at the expiration of that time one\r\narose to his feet with a mighty roar. The other lay dead, his glossy coat\r\ncut into ribbons, and his life-blood staining the foliage for a dozen\r\nfeet on either side.\r\n\r\nWhether the victor was the one who had first confronted him Philip could\r\nnot decide; but he came directly toward the carcass, after licking his\r\nwounds; and now the question arose as to whether the hungry man should\r\nsee his dinner devoured when, possibly, he had the means of preventing it.\r\n\r\nRecharging the two chambers of the weapon which had been emptied into the\r\nbody of the deer, Philip took careful aim between the panther’s eyes and\r\nfired.\r\n\r\nThe ball simply grazed the animal’s skull, half stunning him for an\r\ninstant, and causing him to whirl around in such a manner that there was\r\nno chance of firing a second shot with any degree of accuracy.\r\n\r\nWith an angry scream the panther leaped to his feet once more,\r\nimmediately searching for this new antagonist, whom he discovered with\r\nbut little difficulty after a few seconds. The blood blinded his eyes;\r\nbut he made a desperate leap with such effect that one of his huge paws\r\nbrushed Philip’s foot. The foliage was not sufficiently thick to check\r\nthe impetus of his jump, and he fell on the opposite side with a force\r\nthat rolled him over half a dozen times.\r\n\r\nPhilip could not afford to waste ammunition, therefore he decided to fire\r\nonly when there was a probability of hitting the mark fairly; and from\r\nhis reasonably safe position he watched the antics of the enraged animal.\r\n\r\nThree different times did the panther run back from the tree and then\r\nspring toward his enemy, but never leaping higher than at the first\r\nattempt. With each failure he lost more and more of his temper. He rolled\r\non the ground and roared in impotent rage, made frantic rushes at the\r\ntree, and twice climbed nearly to where Philip sat.\r\n\r\nFour times did the hunter fire point-blank at the animal; but little\r\nexecution was done, save to further enrage the beast, because of the\r\nfoliage which impeded the view.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: As Philip emerged from the ravine he discovered a panther\r\nstanding over the game.—(See page 67.)]\r\n\r\nIt was not until after fully an hour had passed that the panther settled\r\ndown on his haunches and gazed steadily at the tree, as if trying to\r\ndecide what his next move should be.\r\n\r\nThis was the opportunity for which Philip had waited, and with a\r\nwell-directed shot he ended the contest, tumbling the huge cat over,\r\nwhere, after a few spasmodic twitches of the muscles, he lay motionless\r\nand dead.\r\n\r\nWhen Philip became convinced there was no longer any life in the beast he\r\ndescended from the tree, hastily cut out a quarter of the deer, and made\r\nhis way with all possible speed down the ravine, for the neighborhood\r\nwas one in which he did not care to linger. Under other circumstances\r\nhe might have had sufficient curiosity to examine the bodies of the\r\nanimals; but just now it was dinner, not natural history, in which he was\r\ninterested, and his one thought was to roast as quickly as possible the\r\nmeat which had so nearly cost him his life.\r\n\r\nBy following up the ravine toward the east he came upon a small stream\r\nwhich had its source among a series of hills, of which the one he\r\nascended was the westernmost, and here he halted.\r\n\r\nAfter gathering a quantity of dry twigs and leaves he soon started a\r\nblaze by discharging his revolver directly into the inflammable material,\r\nand half an hour later his hunger was satisfied with venison steaks,\r\nseveral of which were eaten before the fire had made any very great\r\nchange in their appearance.\r\n\r\nThe fatigue, excitement and mental distress of the past three days had\r\nwearied him to the verge of exhaustion, and now that the desire for food\r\nwas appeased he hastened to enjoy the repose so sadly needed.\r\n\r\nAmong some tamarind-trees which grew near the edge of the stream he\r\nlaid down, after hanging the remnant of meat among the branches for\r\nsafe-keeping, and hardly was his head upon the mossy pillow ere his eyes\r\nclosed in the most profound slumber.\r\n\r\nHow long that sleep lasted he knew not, save from the fact that when he\r\nclosed his eyes the sun was in the zenith, and on opening them again\r\nit was precisely at the same point; therefore it seemed as if what was\r\nintended for a short nap must have continued exactly twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe meat hung where he left it; but the tropical sun had already begun to\r\ntaint it. To a man in Philip’s position such an incident is but trifling,\r\nand despite its condition he broiled for himself another meal, saying, as\r\nhe did so:\r\n\r\n“I sha’n’t miss the seasoning while it is so rank, therefore there is no\r\ngreat loss without some small gain.”\r\n\r\nAfter the repast was ended he remained seated in the shelter of the trees\r\ntrying to form some plan of relief, when he became aware of a certain\r\nrustling near-by which could not have been produced by the gentle breeze\r\namong the foliage.\r\n\r\nAny unusual sound, however slight, in such a place demanded immediate\r\nattention, because of the variety of enemies he had already met, and with\r\nhis revolver ready for instant use he advanced cautiously toward the\r\nspot from whence the noise appeared to proceed.\r\n\r\nSlowly, on tiptoe and with bated breath, he continued his way to a\r\nthicket of mimosas, and raising the thorny branches with the utmost\r\ncaution peered forward at that which caused him to stand as if\r\nspell-bound with horror.\r\n\r\nBefore him, suspended to the branches of a tree, was a huge skeleton, its\r\nbones, which were bleached white as ivory, standing out in vivid contrast\r\nagainst the dark green leaves.\r\n\r\nIt was some moments before Philip could control his emotions sufficiently\r\nto approach this horrible object; but when he did so, alarm gave way to\r\nsurprise. He seized the foot of the rustling, ominous-looking fruit borne\r\nby the mimosa, but it proved to be a hand. In an instant he understood\r\nthat the skeleton was that of an ape—a gigantic mandrill, enemy of the\r\nbaboon, with whom it shares the empire of ferocity.\r\n\r\nJudging from the size of the bones, Philip knew that the ape to which it\r\nformerly belonged must have surpassed in size and strength any of the\r\nspecies he had ever seen; but how it chanced to be suspended in such a\r\nmanner was something concerning which he could form no plausible idea.\r\n\r\nThat the animal had been skinned before being strung up like a malefactor\r\nwas apparent from the fact that no fragment of hide was to be found at\r\nthe bottom of the tree or clinging to the bones.\r\n\r\nImprobable as was the thought, Philip fancied he looked upon the\r\nevidences of an execution. It surely appeared as if the mandrill had been\r\nhanged, and then, to make the punishment more degrading, skinned after\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nAs may be supposed, Philip did not linger long in this vicinity. His\r\nown condition afforded plenty of food for sorrow, and there was no\r\nnecessity to torture his mind with a sinister object such as called forth\r\nspeculations which could not be otherwise than painful.\r\n\r\nThe suspended skeleton had the effect, however, of lessening his troubles\r\nto a certain extent, for as he made his way toward the east once more\r\nthere was in his mind plenty of food for thought other than the forlorn\r\ncondition in which he had so suddenly been plunged.\r\n\r\nWhat spot on this vast globe had he found where apes usurped the place\r\nof man? And was there a human being dwelling on the island? How did it\r\nhappen that the different species of monkeys he had seen were so familiar\r\nwith man?\r\n\r\nThis last question caused him to have more faith that he would soon find\r\nothers of his kind, and he pressed forward with renewed hope and vigor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nA REMARKABLE GATHERING.\r\n\r\n\r\nRefreshed by the profound slumber, and his mind fully occupied with\r\nthoughts called forth by the discovery of the skeleton, Philip continued\r\nstraight on, knowing not where he was going until nightfall. So intent\r\nwas he on this subject that he felt no fatigue, but traveled like one in\r\na dream through the forest, which was partially illumined by the moon;\r\nand not until this pale, cold light underwent a most complete change did\r\nhe fully realize what was passing around him.\r\n\r\nThe diminution of light, the gray, reddish mist which arose on the air,\r\ncame from no natural cause, and Philip instinctively climbed a tree to\r\ngain, if possible, a more extended view.\r\n\r\nTo his great joy, from this point of vantage he could see flames on the\r\nfurther side of the island. Fire betokened the presence of human beings,\r\nand with a glad cry Philip descended from the tree to press forward at\r\nfull speed.\r\n\r\nThe conflagration, however, was much further away than he at first\r\nsupposed. An hour passed, and yet he had not approached near enough to\r\ndiscern it through the thicket. Several times, while following the\r\ndepressions of the land, his range of vision was so obscured that it\r\nbecame necessary to again climb a tree to make certain he was pursuing\r\nthe proper direction, and after four hours had elapsed the guiding light\r\ndied away entirely.\r\n\r\nHe was now without any means of shaping a course, and, knowing full\r\nwell the folly of traveling at random in a forest during the night when\r\nobjects are distorted by the gloom, he came to a halt.\r\n\r\nWhile groping around to find a suitable place in which to sleep, he\r\ndiscovered, to his great surprise, that the trees no longer grew at\r\nirregular intervals, but were standing in straight rows, as if planted\r\nby the hand of man. The soil had every appearance of having been tilled;\r\ninstead of walking on a springy turf, or over the decaying leaves of the\r\njungle, his feet sunk in the loam. The foliage no longer presented such\r\na variety of plants, but was all of the same species and covered thickly\r\nwith fruit.\r\n\r\nPlucking one from a branch that bent down within reach he discovered that\r\nit was a guava, produced by a regular system of culture. There was an\r\nabsence of harshness which characterizes this fruit in its natural state,\r\nand the discovery was further proof to him that human beings dwelt upon\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nAfter a light repast of the pleasant-flavored but ill-smelling apple he\r\nlay down to rest, and did not awaken until a terrific uproar, similar to\r\nthat which so startled his disagreeable companions the first day of his\r\narrival at the island, rang out on the clear air.\r\n\r\nThe din, indistinct at first, assumed the various gradations belonging to\r\nthe voices of wild animals—from the tiger’s snarl and the howling of the\r\nhyena to the most piercing shrieks and shrillest whistles.\r\n\r\nIt was but natural that Philip should feel thoroughly alarmed, and make\r\nevery effort to seek refuge from this new danger which seemed close at\r\nhand. Running forward he followed, without absolutely intending to do so,\r\nthe line of cultivated trees, and at the further end, in what appeared to\r\nbe a vast thicket, he crouched, waiting until the sun should reveal the\r\ndenizens of the jungle.\r\n\r\nThe day, which in the tropics does not steal on by degrees but bursts\r\nforth in a sudden glory, filled the forest with dazzling light, and\r\nthrough the numerous openings in the foliage Philip beheld that which\r\nmight seem to be improbable but for the fact that it can be supported by\r\nthe testimony of one of the most celebrated German naturalists.\r\n\r\nIn a vast cleared space which formed a natural arena was a group of\r\nindividuals partially clad in uniforms such as are worn by many of our\r\nmerchant-sailors, who believe that a distinctive dress on shipboard is\r\nconducive to discipline.\r\n\r\nThe members of this gathering were seated on a slight elevation\r\napparently in grave deliberation, as if holding a sort of court-martial,\r\nwhile among them was one who towered above the others, with a cap on\r\nwhich were three bands of gold-lace, and a coat plentifully bedecked with\r\nthe same material.\r\n\r\nIt was not the uniforms nor the positions of these individuals which\r\nsurprised Philip. The cause of his profound astonishment, amounting\r\nalmost to bewilderment, was the fact that the entire assembly was\r\ncomposed of apes, and the one in authority wore a uniform identical with\r\nthat which Philip had seen on Captain Seaworth the day when he and his\r\nofficers made the purchases at the animal-trainer’s establishment.\r\n\r\nComposing this court—if such it can be called—and ranged about the\r\nleader in circles, were all species of the monkey-tribe, or, to speak\r\nmore correctly, the ferocious members of that large family. Each one\r\nwas clad in some portion of a uniform, but none save the leader boasted\r\nof an entire suit. Two or three had nothing more than caps; others wore\r\ntrousers, and several displayed partial suits of underclothing. One\r\nape was the proud possessor of a blue coat; another carried a saber\r\nwith the belt around his neck, while a number had the weapons minus\r\nbelts. Two or three were fortunate only in having gloves, which were as\r\noften on their feet as their hands. Some had coats on hind-side before\r\nwithout any attempt at buttoning them, and not a few were decorated with\r\nbright-colored ribbons. Philip also noticed half a dozen who had portions\r\nof female wearing apparel, such as dresses or capes.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the party were armed with some kind of a weapon, either\r\nsaber, boarding-pike, or capstan-bar.\r\n\r\nPhilip hardly completed his inspection of this singular-looking assembly\r\nwhen he who appeared to be the leader began what was evidently a speech\r\nlasting four or five minutes, and listened to with the utmost gravity by\r\nall.\r\n\r\nWhen he had concluded, half a dozen of those nearest him marched solemnly\r\ninto the thicket opposite Philip’s hiding-place, and returned with twenty\r\nof the most inoffensive of the monkey-tribe, known as vervets, all of\r\nwhom were securely bound with ropes made from bark.\r\n\r\nThese were arraigned before the leader like so many criminals, and he\r\naddressed them with a succession of harsh, guttural cries until the poor\r\ncreatures vainly tried to escape from the awful presence, but only to be\r\ndragged back by their captors, who belabored them with bamboo sticks.\r\n\r\nDuring fully a quarter of an hour this scene was continued, and then, as\r\nif at a signal from the leader, a squad of huge apes, each of whom was\r\narmed with a long stick, began flogging the prisoners unmercifully.\r\n\r\nIt was possible for Philip to hear the blows even though so far away,\r\nand the unfortunate vervets gave vent to the most plaintive cries, which\r\nsounded very much like appeals for mercy.\r\n\r\nThe executioners—for such they appeared to be—continued the punishment\r\nuntil seemingly wearied with their cruel exertions, and then, unloosing\r\ntheir bonds, drove the culprits from among them into the depths of the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was this done than the entire assembly crowded around the\r\nleader, stroking his back, licking his hands, fawning at his feet, and in\r\nevery possible way showing the utmost respect mingled with fear.\r\n\r\nWhen the big ape had received sufficient adulation to satisfy him he\r\nwaved his hand by way of signal for his followers to desist, and then,\r\narising majestically, started toward what was evidently a continuation of\r\nthe clearing, followed by his adherents.\r\n\r\nIf Philip’s surprise at this strange proceeding had been great, one can\r\nimagine how much it was intensified when he recognized in this pompous\r\nleader none other than the gigantic Goliah whom he had once owned and\r\nsold to Captain Seaworth!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nAN ODD VILLAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip Garland’s surprise at seeing this vast assembly of apes\r\nconducting themselves so thoroughly after the manner of human beings was\r\nindeed great; but to recognize in the leader of the party an article\r\nof merchandise which he had sold to Captain Seaworth was absolutely\r\nbewildering.\r\n\r\nHow had Goliah reached this particular island? Had he taught these\r\ncompanions of his to imitate man, or were they his instructors? In either\r\ncase, how did it happen that among these animals there should be such a\r\ncollection of weapons and clothing?\r\n\r\nThese questions Philip asked himself without being able to make any\r\nreply. He was in that mental condition when one’s will has no control\r\nover the body, and half-unconsciously he followed the procession as\r\nit left the open-air court-room, although in his mind there was a\r\nvery-well-defined idea that by so doing he exposed himself to the most\r\nextreme danger.\r\n\r\nIn his stupefaction—perhaps fascination would be the better word—he\r\nadvanced cautiously as if by instinct, keeping well in the rear of the\r\nparty, gliding from tree-trunk to tree-trunk, and halting within the\r\ncover of the foliage whenever any of the apes showed an inclination to\r\nloiter.\r\n\r\nIt was during one of these forced halts, and while obliged to remain\r\nconcealed a longer time than usual, that quite by accident he chanced to\r\nglance through the thicket on his right, thereby increasing surprise to\r\nthe very verge of bewilderment.\r\n\r\nHe saw there, at a distance of thirty or forty yards from where he stood,\r\na collection of small huts built in the fashion of hamlets such as one\r\nsees in Java. Around these loitered a number of apes, some few partially\r\ndressed in garments of European manufacture, and the remainder clad only\r\nas nature intended they should be; but nowhere could he perceive a human\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nIt was not possible that this monkey-tribe had built these neat\r\ndwellings, which were ornamented with paint, lighted by glass windows,\r\nand protected from the sun’s fervent rays by awnings; but yet, where were\r\nthe builders? Where the rightful inhabitants?\r\n\r\nWhile standing in mute astonishment, with his eyes fixed upon the tiny\r\nvillage, the procession from the court had passed out of sight into the\r\nthicket unheeded by him, who had no thought save that of solving the\r\nstrange riddle.\r\n\r\nWhile only partially screened by the foliage Philip was startled, almost\r\nalarmed, by a light touch on his arm, and wheeling around suddenly, he\r\nsaw another of the animals sold by him to Captain Seaworth.\r\n\r\nThis was the chimpanzee Sweet Alice, and that she recognized him there\r\ncould be no mistake. Looking up into his face, while at the same time\r\nplucking at the sleeve of his coat and pointing toward the village, she\r\ngave him to understand, almost as well as could have been done by words,\r\nher desire to have him follow.\r\n\r\nHad Philip been in a less complete state of bewilderment he would have\r\nhesitated before entering the little town, where, undoubtedly, his\r\narrival would be communicated to the huge baboon and he find himself a\r\nprisoner once more. But in his present frame of mind nothing seemed more\r\nnatural than to accede to the chimpanzee’s mute request, and he motioned\r\nher to lead the way.\r\n\r\nInstead of going directly toward the buildings she moved off at\r\nright-angles with them, looking cautiously from side to side as if to let\r\nhim understand that their advance should be concealed as far as possible,\r\nand he followed her every movement.\r\n\r\nDuring fifteen minutes the stealthy march was continued, interrupted now\r\nand then as the chimpanzee stopped to listen or crept nearer to the edge\r\nof the clearing to reconnoiter, and in all this time they had seen but\r\none other member of the tribe. He was evidently a laborer, and failed to\r\nsee the stranger because of his occupation, which consisted of splitting\r\nlogs with his fingers and an ax. He handled the tool very awkwardly, but\r\nyet with a certain air which caused Philip to believe man had been his\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\nOn emerging from the thicket the traveler discovered that they had\r\narrived at the outskirts of the village in the rear of the houses,\r\nopposite the point where he first caught a glimpse of the settlement.\r\nHere was a row of iron-barred cages, all but one of which were empty,\r\nand toward this particular prison the chimpanzee advanced, beckoning her\r\ncompanion to follow.\r\n\r\nHesitatingly he did so, and looking through the bars saw the other animal\r\nhe had sold to Captain Seaworth—Ben Bolt!\r\n\r\nThe sight of this captive gave Philip a solution to the riddle, and he\r\nuttered a low exclamation of surprise that he had not sooner guessed it.\r\n\r\nThere could no longer be any question but that he was on the island where\r\nthe corporation, whose agent Captain Seaworth was, had started their\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\nUpon examining the iron cages more closely he saw that they were the same\r\ntaken from his establishment when the animals were purchased, and in them\r\nhad been confined the gigantic Goliah. But how had he escaped? Where was\r\nthe captain and those who had been brought out as colonists?\r\n\r\nIt was hardly possible the tribe of monkeys could have vanquished the\r\nentire party, and not probable Goliah had been released until the human\r\nbeings were disposed of in some way. Was this seeming capture of the\r\nvillage the sequel to a story of which he had seen the first chapter in\r\nthe skeleton among the mimosas?\r\n\r\nPhilip had solved one problem only to find himself confronted by another\r\nyet more perplexing and painful. He was on the very island where his\r\nfriends had landed, and yet no signs of them could be seen save in the\r\nclothing, the cottages, and the behavior of the apes.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts passed through the shipwrecked youth’s mind very rapidly.\r\nOnly for a few moments did he stand undecided before the cage which\r\nconfined Ben Bolt, and then he drew the bars, allowing the unhappy\r\ncaptive to go free.\r\n\r\nInstantly the chimpanzee was released he rushed toward Philip, fawning\r\naround him several minutes, and then turned to Alice, whom he greeted\r\nwith every evidence of affection. During fully five minutes these two\r\nanimals capered like dogs who evince joy at a master’s return. Then Alice\r\nsuddenly raised her head as if in fear, lowering it again as the hair on\r\nher neck stood erect like that of an angry cat’s, while she motioned with\r\none paw toward the forest, and with the other thrust Ben Bolt back into\r\nthe cage, expressing by every gesture her desire that the door should be\r\nfastened again.\r\n\r\nSo much intelligence had these chimpanzees displayed while in his\r\nestablishment that the animal-trainer felt no hesitation about following\r\nthe mute instructions; and the bars were hardly replaced when hoarse,\r\nguttural cries in the distance told that Goliah was approaching.\r\n\r\nTo remain there longer would undoubtedly be to find himself in the power\r\nof his former chattel. In such case, what revenge might not the gigantic\r\nbaboon take? If the chimpanzees remembered him so well, Goliah’s memory\r\nwould hardly be less retentive, and the floggings so often administered\r\nmight be repaid with compound interest.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that Alice understood this as well as did Philip, for on her\r\nface were the liveliest expressions of terror, and she plucked at his\r\ncoat-sleeve trying to draw him away, while pointing toward the forest\r\nfrom whence came the hoarse cries.\r\n\r\nThere was no longer any time for hesitation, and trusting himself\r\nimplicitly to the guidance of the chimpanzee, Philip followed, the two\r\npassing the rear of the cages just as the baboon went by in front to\r\nvisit the prisoner.\r\n\r\nNot an ape was to be seen on the principal street of the village, and as\r\nthey walked past the buildings Philip had an opportunity of examining\r\ntheir condition.\r\n\r\nWhat at a distance appeared to be a collection of neat cottages proved,\r\non closer inspection, to be hardly more than ruins. The windows of the\r\nhouses were broken, the frames splintered, and the greater portion\r\nwrenched entirely out of their casings. From the second stories, hanging\r\non long poles, were torn uniforms, cravats, boots, belts, hats, empty\r\nbottles, trousers, towels, rags of all colors, shirts, and even a few\r\nflags. The paint was defaced, the fences were torn down, and everywhere\r\non the ground were scattered bones, fragments of glass and crockery, and\r\ntins which once contained canned meats or vegetables. In several places\r\nwhere crops had been growing could now be seen only dried stalks. The\r\nchicken-coops, which were attached to nearly every dwelling, had been\r\nwrecked, and the feathers scattered here and there told the fate of their\r\noccupants.\r\n\r\nIt was a scene of pillage and waste such as would have shamed the\r\nhangers-on of any army, however demoralized; and Philip, now hardly more\r\nthan a fugitive, thought with dismay of those who had probably met their\r\ndeath while trying to found this colony. Never since the shipwreck had\r\nhe been so thoroughly dispirited, and but for the constant tugging of\r\nthe chimpanzee at his garments he might have lingered until it would be\r\nno longer possible to escape. She literally pulled him along through the\r\ntiny village until the seclusion of the thicket was gained, when her\r\nmovements became more leisurely, and he understood that there was no\r\nlonger any necessity for such rapid flight.\r\n\r\nProbably because the chimpanzee believed they were safe for the time\r\nbeing from Goliah, and that her companion did not require such careful\r\nwatching, she took the lead, proceeding through the jungle about an\r\neighth of a mile to a large banana-grove, where she began to search for\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nHere, as at the village, were the same evidences of wanton destruction.\r\nThe long leaves of the plants were torn and trampled, bunches of\r\nhalf-eaten fruit lay decaying upon the ground, and that which had cost no\r\nslight amount of both time and money was almost entirely destroyed.\r\n\r\nAfter some search the chimpanzee succeeded in finding two clusters of\r\nthe rich, yellow fruit, and motioning Philip to pluck them, she pointed\r\ntoward the east, as if intimating the direction in which they must travel.\r\n\r\nBy this time the shipwrecked youth recognized the wisdom of his guide’s\r\nadvice, and staggering under the heavy load of fruit, he followed close\r\nbehind as she left the cultivated ground to re-enter the jungle.\r\n\r\nThis detour had evidently been made for the purpose of providing him\r\nwith food in such place of refuge as she was probably about to lead him;\r\nand at that moment the animal-trainer had a higher appreciation of the\r\nintelligence of the monkey-tribe than ever before.\r\n\r\nAt a short distance from the banana plantation the chimpanzee stopped in\r\nfront of a palm-grove bearing smooth, shining fruit of a golden-orange\r\ncolor, which was very attractive in appearance, and Philip began to\r\ngather such as hung within his reach from the smaller trees, when, much\r\nto his surprise, Alice made the most violent demonstrations of rage.\r\nShe held the delicious-looking apples to her mouth for an instant, and\r\nthen, dashing them to the ground, screamed and chattered volubly. It was\r\nseveral seconds before the fugitive understood this pantomime; but when\r\nshe repeated it two or three times he gained an inkling of her meaning.\r\n\r\nWithout question this beautiful fruit was poisonous, and she had called\r\nhis attention to the fact that he might not at any future time eat what\r\nwas so tempting in appearance but deadly in its properties.\r\n\r\nA ten minutes’ walk from this spot led them to a natural grotto in the\r\nrocks, the floor of which was covered with thick moss and the thousand\r\nvegetable productions to be found in Malaysia.\r\n\r\nHere her gestures were as expressive as words, and Philip understood that\r\nshe was cautioning him to remain in hiding—probably until her return. She\r\npointed first to the fruit, secondly to the grotto, and then back in the\r\ndirection from which they had come, taking her departure only when he\r\nnodded his head in token of willingness to obey the mute injunction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE TREASURE-CAVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip’s first sensation after being left alone was one of intense\r\nrelief. For the time being, at least, he was safe from pursuit, and\r\nhad not only food, but water sufficient to satisfy his wants two or\r\nthree days. Whether Alice returned or not he would be free from hunger\r\nor thirst, since to revisit the banana plantation only a brisk walk of\r\nfifteen minutes was necessary.\r\n\r\nAfter making a hearty meal from the fruit he lay down, and during the\r\nnext ten hours was wrapped in the blissful unconsciousness of sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen he awakened it was nearly sunset. Far away in the distance could be\r\nheard the cries of the apes, and among them he fancied it was possible\r\nto distinguish Goliah’s hoarse voice. To venture forth would be both\r\nneedless and unwise, and he remained within the grotto, trying in vain to\r\nfind some amusement or occupation which would serve to make the time pass\r\nmore rapidly.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, in this attempt he was unsuccessful. There was\r\nnothing to be done save to count the seconds, and it does not require\r\nmany moments to weary one of such a useless occupation.\r\n\r\nNow he had an opportunity to understand how painful may be the attack\r\nof insects which in other quarters of the globe would be considered\r\ninsignificant. His hands, face and ankles were completely covered with\r\npainful red blotches, caused by the bites of tiny flies; and a closer\r\ninspection of the grotto showed him that he was by no means alone.\r\n\r\nNow and then could be seen curious little animals, similar to mice, which\r\nran back and forth, nibbling at the bananas, his shoes, or anything\r\nwithin reach, until a movement by him would cause them to hide in alarm.\r\nEvery time he overturned a stone or stick he found snugly ensconced under\r\nit formidable scorpions, with their tails sticking up ready for an attack\r\nor to defend themselves.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if every nook and corner of the grotto was teeming with life\r\nin some form of viciousness, and not until he had cleared a space, six\r\nfeet square, from gravel and the litter which would usually be found in\r\nsuch a place could he lie down with any chance of being unmolested.\r\n\r\nThere was plenty of time for reflection—too much, in fact, for his own\r\ngood; and after making the wildest conjectures as to the probable fate\r\nof Captain Seaworth and his party, Philip began to speculate upon the\r\nprobable length of his voluntary imprisonment. He could see no immediate\r\nrelief from the unpleasant occupants of the island, and the longer his\r\nmind dwelt upon the subject the more convinced did he become that some\r\ndesperate effort to escape must be made.\r\n\r\nThen came the important question of where he should flee. It was hardly\r\nprobable there were other human beings on the island, otherwise they\r\nwould have driven the apes from the cottages erected by the Seaworth\r\nparty; and to leave this place of refuge, where he was reasonably sure of\r\nreceiving food from the chimpanzee, would be to call down upon himself\r\na repetition of the unpleasant and painful events which he had already\r\nexperienced.\r\n\r\nThe night was very far advanced before his mind was sufficiently calm\r\nto permit of his sleeping once more; but slumber did finally visit his\r\neyelids, bringing in its train most disagreeable dreams, from which he\r\nwas glad to be awakened before the sun had again illumined this tiny\r\nportion of the world.\r\n\r\nWith absolutely nothing save painful thoughts to occupy his attention, he\r\nbegan in a listless manner to examine more closely his place of refuge.\r\n\r\nAs has been said, it was a natural grotto formed in the rocks, but\r\napparently extending some distance into the range of hills which\r\nstretched nearly across the island. The rear portion narrowed down to\r\nwhat seemed to be a tunnel hardly more than four feet in diameter. In\r\nthis Philip entered without hesitation, crawling upon his hands and knees\r\nfor a distance of about a hundred feet, during which the passage grew\r\nmore and more contracted, until to turn around would have been absolutely\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nAt the end of such distance was an abrupt angle, after which it was\r\npossible for him to proceed in a half-bent attitude along the tunnel,\r\nwhich was floored with sand, and obstructed here and there by boulders\r\nor irregular blocks of what appeared to be limestone.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he had walked in this second direction two hundred feet, when, on\r\nturning a second angle, he stood in an oval-shaped chamber about twenty\r\nyards wide, twice as long, and twenty-five feet high.\r\n\r\nIt was a marvelous scene which met his startled gaze. Those who have\r\nentered natural caves may have seen a similar picture, but certainly\r\nnothing more imposing.\r\n\r\nIn the center of this subterranean cavern was a small circular lake,\r\nhardly more than twelve feet in diameter, and sunken half a dozen inches\r\nfrom the level of a floor formed of blackish-gray sand, covered with\r\nsmall pebbles of various brilliant colors. The ceiling towered high\r\nabove, and was dome-shaped, thickly-studded with pendant stalactites,\r\nas if Nature had thus given to the artisan the first idea of lincrusta\r\nwork. On the right, or eastern side, were benches of rocks rising like\r\nterraces, bearing huge stalagmites shaped like animals, and incrusted\r\nwith myriads of tiny crystals which glistened like diamonds in the light\r\nadmitted through an opening partially obscured by the foliage in the\r\ncenter of the dome.\r\n\r\nAfter standing silent and motionless several moments, lost in admiration\r\nof the scene before him, Philip pushed on toward another tunnel which led\r\nfrom the chamber directly opposite the one he had just traversed.\r\n\r\nHere, after five minutes of leisurely walking, the air became warmer and\r\nhumid, as if filled with steam, while on the left side of the tunnel was\r\na stream of water from which arose a peculiar phosphorescent light which\r\npermitted the amazed traveler to see several inches below the surface.\r\n\r\nA closer examination revealed the fact that the stream was filled with\r\nfish, shaped something like a trout, and, singular as it may seem, the\r\nluminous glow was emitted from their bodies. He plunged his hand in\r\nwithout alarming the finny tribe, and lifting one out discovered that it\r\nwas blind, having no sign of an eye, which accounted for the readiness\r\nwith which he had made the capture.\r\n\r\nCuriosity impelled Philip to continue his explorations without delay, and\r\nhe advanced rapidly along the tunnel, in which it was now possible to\r\nstand erect. With every step the air grew warmer, until it was as if one\r\nwere suddenly plunged in a steam bath.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this excessive humidity was soon learned. In one corner of a\r\nsecond chamber was a boiling spring, which bubbled and hissed just below\r\nthe surface of the floor.\r\n\r\nHe dipped his hand in, but immediately withdrew it as he gave vent to a\r\ncry of pain. The water was boiling hot!\r\n\r\nThis cavern also had an exit or outlet about forty feet long, which\r\nopened into a third, nearly twice as large as the first. From the roof\r\nhung hundreds of stalactites, some only a few feet in length and others\r\nwhich descended to the floor. Stalagmites glittered and glistened like\r\nimmense diamonds in a strong phosphorescent light, until the radiations\r\nand reflections lent such an indescribable charm to the cave that it\r\nseemed as if one were living through a story from the “Arabian Nights.”\r\nThis third room was evidently the end of the chain of caverns. In it\r\nthere was no opening, yet the glow from the middle apartment filled it\r\nwith light.\r\n\r\nWandering from one point to another without thought of weariness because\r\nof the many wondrous beauties, Philip soon began to realize the fact that\r\nhe was hungry, and when on the point of retreating to the grotto where\r\nthe bananas were, he bethought himself of the trout. To boil two or three\r\nin this kettle formed by nature would be comparatively an easy task, and\r\nat the same time give him a change of diet.\r\n\r\nPassing rapidly on to the stream where he had seen the fish, he caught\r\nand dressed four, fastening them together with a strip torn from his\r\nhandkerchief. Returning to the spring he lowered them, and in a few\r\nmoments had sufficient and appetizing food for a hearty meal. Although\r\neaten without salt, this change in his bill of fare was a welcome one,\r\nand Philip resolved to take with him a supply of cooked fish large enough\r\nto satisfy his wants during several days.\r\n\r\nTo this end he groped about once more on the bed of the stream until his\r\nhand came in contact with a very heavy round substance, which, simply\r\nthrough idle curiosity, he raised to the surface.\r\n\r\nHis astonishment can hardly be described when he discovered that the\r\nsupposed rock was apparently a nugget of pure gold, weighing, as nearly\r\nas he could judge, from three to four pounds.\r\n\r\nThe sight of this wealth, which was also evidence that more might be\r\nfound in the vicinity, so bewildered him that it was several moments\r\nbefore he could make further examinations, and then came the fever for\r\nriches which has been at the same time the destruction and delight of\r\nthousands.\r\n\r\nWorking with desperate energy, as if the unlimited time at his disposal\r\nwas all too short for the purpose, he brought up nugget after nugget,\r\nranging in size from an ounce to half a pound, until he had collected at\r\nleast ten pounds’ weight of the precious metal.\r\n\r\nThe supply appeared to be inexhaustible. As nearly as he could judge, the\r\nbed of the stream was literally covered with these yellow lumps, which\r\nrepresented wealth in any civilized country; and his labor ceased only\r\nwhen he began to realize how impossible, under the present circumstances,\r\nit would be to derive any benefit from this unexpected discovery.\r\n\r\nNow, more than ever, was it necessary he should devise some means of\r\nfinding his fellow-man, even though it should be impossible to carry his\r\ntreasure away. With a vessel and a crew such as could be procured at\r\nBatavia untold wealth might be taken away; but how the first step was to\r\nbe made he had no idea.\r\n\r\nIn order to give himself time for reflection he first hid the nuggets\r\nbehind one of the statue-like formations in the outer chamber, and then\r\nreturned to the grotto.\r\n\r\nHere he found the chimpanzee looking disturbed and alarmed because of\r\nhis absence, but she gave way to manifestations of the greatest delight\r\nat his appearance. With an instinct which seemed almost like human\r\nintelligence she had brought more bananas, and by gestures which were\r\nunmistakable gave him to understand that as yet it was dangerous to leave\r\nhis hiding-place.\r\n\r\nThen, after fawning upon him like a dog once more, she walked slowly away\r\nin the direction of the village, turning from time to time, as if to be\r\ncertain he would not follow.\r\n\r\nWhen finally the animal was lost to view amid the foliage, Philip\r\nretreated to the further end of the grotto as if desirous of guarding the\r\nentrance to the treasure-cave, and there gave himself up to speculations\r\nregarding his flight from the island, forming some plans which were\r\nhardly more than wild dreams, and others possible of execution.\r\n\r\nThe desire to learn the fate of Captain Seaworth and his party was almost\r\nforgotten in his eagerness to profit by the rich discovery, and during\r\nthe remainder of that day the only thought in his mind was how to leave\r\nthe island, taking with him at least a portion of the newly-found wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTREASURE-GATHERING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Philip was in a situation where gold was of far less value than\r\nfood, or even raiment, that thirst for wealth which has come upon so many\r\neven under similar circumstances became so great as to create a most\r\nintense desire to pile up the largest possible quantity of the precious\r\nbut—to him—useless metal.\r\n\r\nUntil a late hour in the night he gathered nuggets from the bed of the\r\nstream, being able to work as well in the under-ground chamber during the\r\ntime of darkness as any other, owing to the phosphorescent light from the\r\nfish, until he had hidden behind the natural statue a weight sufficient\r\nto burden half a dozen men in the carrying. Upon the rough calculation\r\nthat twenty-five thousand dollars in gold weighs a hundred pounds, he had\r\ngood reason to believe that the value of his treasure was considerably\r\nmore than a hundred thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nIt was only his desire for sleep which caused him to desist; and\r\nreturning once more to the grotto, after a meal of boiled fish he laid\r\nhimself down to sleep, not awakening until daybreak, when, from the mouth\r\nof the hill-side cave, he saw what aroused again in his mind the belief\r\nthat other human beings beside himself were upon the island.\r\n\r\nThe reflection of flames could be seen through the forest, evidently\r\ncaused by an enormous bonfire, and the only reasonable supposition was\r\nthat shipwrecked mariners were sending out this beacon-light in the hope\r\nof attracting attention from those on some passing ship. Perhaps more\r\nthan he had been saved from the Swallow, and with this thought he darted\r\nforward at full speed, heeding not possible discovery by the apes in his\r\neagerness to be again with human companions.\r\n\r\nIf such a thing were possible, he was more anxious now than ever before\r\nto meet with men, for unless assistance could be obtained his wealth was\r\nuseless; and regardless of the thorns which pierced his flesh, or of the\r\npitfalls that might be in his path, he ran swiftly on toward the more\r\nthan welcome light.\r\n\r\nThe nearer he approached to the flames the stronger his hopes grew,\r\nfor he could see beyond a peradventure that it was a bonfire on the\r\nhighest point of the island, where people signaling for assistance would\r\nnaturally build a beacon.\r\n\r\nThat an enormous quantity of fuel was being consumed could be told\r\nfrom the fact that it required nearly an hour of rapid walking before\r\nhe arrived at the base of the elevation; and in the highest state of\r\nexcitement he ran up the rocky slope, the soil rattling and crumbling\r\nunder his feet with such a peculiar sound that it was reasonable to\r\nsuppose he was traveling over the lava of an extinct volcano.\r\n\r\nHere he came upon a kind of vegetation through which it was absolutely\r\nimpossible to pass. Occupying a space of a hundred feet square, as nearly\r\nas he could judge, was a veritable jungle of thorns across which fifty\r\nmen with the best of tools would have been many hours in making a road.\r\n\r\nThe bushes, the creepers, and even the bamboos were covered with these\r\nlong, needle-like points, which tore his flesh cruelly. Everything grew\r\nzig-zag and jagged, and in an inextricable tangle. To get through without\r\nlacerating his body to such an extent as to be in danger of death was out\r\nof the question, and in order to reach the desired spot a long detour was\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nWhen within two-thirds of the distance to the summit a most extraordinary\r\nspectacle greeted him. Instead of human beings it was apes who had\r\nkindled the fire, and were most industriously engaged in feeding it.\r\n\r\nTwo files, composed of over a hundred of these animals, stretched from\r\nthe top of the hill down the side as far as he could see, a distance of\r\nabout six feet separating one from the other. This party was passing\r\nfragments of wood, branches of trees, and such combustible materials, up\r\nthe incline to those at the top, who threw the fuel into the flames.\r\n\r\nIndustrious laborers were they, indeed. Not a sound could be heard, and\r\nwith the utmost gravity they continued the task as if it was something\r\nupon which their lives depended.\r\n\r\nPhilip now saw that he was upon the crest of a small volcano which had\r\nevidently not been in a state of eruption for some time, and the fire was\r\nbuilt within the blackened crater, with so much fuel that it more than\r\nfilled the space, the glowing coals rising several feet above the summit.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably it was the reflection of a fire similar to this which\r\nhe had previously seen; but why these animals, who are supposed to\r\nfear anything of the kind, worked so hard to keep the blaze alive was\r\nsomething he could not even imagine. The wood literally flew through the\r\nair, so eager were the laborers to see the flames leap and dance in the\r\ngray light of the morning; and it was with a certain fascination, similar\r\nto that experienced while viewing the proceedings of the court a few days\r\nbefore, that Philip gazed upon the scene.\r\n\r\nIt could not have been more than five minutes that he remained motionless\r\nwatching these strange proceedings, and just when he began to realize\r\nhow necessary it was to leave the place before being discovered the apes\r\ncaught sight of him.\r\n\r\nIn an instant, as if by magic, the silence was broken. A dozen of the\r\nanimals clustered around him, shouting and screaming as if to others in\r\nthe distance, until the din was almost deafening, and he could hear it\r\nechoed and re-echoed far away in the distance. His first thought was to\r\nmake his escape, by force if necessary; but before he could even so much\r\nas raise his hands two gigantic baboons leaped toward him and seized,\r\nfirmly but not roughly, both his arms.\r\n\r\nEither one of the animals could have held him prisoner despite his most\r\nviolent resistance, and Philip realized full well the uselessness of a\r\nstruggle in which he would inevitably receive many severe blows, even if\r\nhe should be so fortunate as to escape death.\r\n\r\nDuring fifteen minutes the screaming and yelling continued, his captors\r\nholding him immovable all the while; and then, as if a summons had been\r\nreceived from some one in authority, the two baboons led him down the\r\nhill, followed by all those who had been working so energetically to feed\r\nthe flames.\r\n\r\nThrough the forest in the direction by which he had approached, past the\r\nbanana plantation to the single street of the tiny settlement, Philip\r\nwas led like a malefactor, with the long train of grinning, chattering\r\nfollowers; and he had good reason to believe his fate might be the same\r\nas that of the skeleton which he had seen hanging in the thicket of\r\nmimosas. He knew beyond a peradventure that he was being conducted to the\r\npresence of Goliah, and who could say what the vindictive baboon might\r\ndevise in the way of punishment for the one who had not, in his case at\r\nleast, been a gentle master.\r\n\r\nGoliah would remember all that had occurred, as could be told from\r\nthe imprisonment of Ben Bolt and the behavior of Alice; therefore the\r\nmerchant who had come so far in search of living curiosities knew there\r\nwas good cause for alarm regarding this meeting.\r\n\r\nUpon reaching the village the baboons led their prisoner to the most\r\npretentious of the little cottages, which had probably been occupied by\r\nCaptain Seaworth as the office or counting-house of the colony, and into\r\nthis he was thrust. His two captors were the only members of the party\r\nwho accompanied him. The others remained in the street, some sitting on\r\ntheir haunches, as if speculating whether they were to be treated to the\r\nspectacle of an execution, a few hanging on the broken fences like boys\r\nwho loiter in front of a residence at which distinguished personages are\r\nvisiting, and the majority of the crowd surrounding the building much as\r\nthough taking steps to prevent an escape.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the dwelling differed but little from the outside, so\r\nfar as the scene of wanton destruction was concerned. Books were thrown\r\nfrom their cases, leaves torn, and the bindings ruthlessly pulled off.\r\nFragments of clothing were strewn on the floor, furniture scratched\r\nand splintered, and pictures turned face to the wall or thrown among\r\nthe debris in one corner of the room. Everything gave token of the\r\nmischievousness of these animals; and yet in the midst of all a certain\r\nkind of order reigned, as if the long-tailed residents were bent on\r\npreserving some semblance of what the interior had once presented.\r\n\r\nAll these things Philip took in at a glance. He had no time to study\r\ndetails, for within a very few seconds a most singular and grotesque\r\nfigure made its appearance from an adjoining room.\r\n\r\nOne would have said it was a gigantic bird, but Philip immediately\r\nrecognized the face as Goliah’s; and the sight of this ape, covered\r\nfrom head to foot with feathers, naturally filled the prisoner with the\r\ngreatest surprise.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this strange transformation, however, was soon revealed. The\r\nfeathers were simply quills, the majority of which had been made into\r\npens, and were stuck over his ears, through the hair on the top of his\r\nhead, under his arms, and in every place where one would remain, not even\r\nexcepting the extreme end of his tail.\r\n\r\nGoliah was followed by two smaller and less ferocious-looking baboons,\r\nwho were decorated in the same fantastic manner, and from their attitude\r\none might readily fancy they occupied the position of servants, or\r\nperhaps counselors to his apish majesty.\r\n\r\nThe sight of this animal, whom he had chastised so many times, caused\r\nPhilip no slight alarm, for there was good reason to believe that some\r\nsignal vengeance might be wreaked upon him, and he peered closely into\r\nthe hairy, feather-bedecked face to learn whether his identity was\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nIf Goliah recognized his old master he gave no sign of such fact,\r\nprobably because he had more important business on hand just at that\r\nmoment. He stopped only long enough to glance at the frightened youth,\r\nand then, consulting for an instant with the two behind him, uttered\r\nseveral sharp cries, which were evidently commands. Immediately Philip’s\r\ncaptors led him into an adjoining room, where was such a scene as would\r\nhave convinced the most skeptical that the monkey-tribe can be trained\r\nto become useful in many ways.\r\n\r\nIn this apartment were at least fifty apes seated at two long tables,\r\nand all in a state of the most intense excitement. They had before them\r\nlarge quantities of paper, huge bottles of ink, and a numerous collection\r\nof quill-pens, which they were using with the same industry and energy\r\nas shown by the feeders of the fire. They leaned over the table like\r\nweary clerks, dipping their pens into the inkstands frequently, often\r\nmistaking their paws for the quills in the general hurry and confusion,\r\nand scribbling upon sheets of paper spread before them, as if trying\r\nto imitate, with the greatest possible fidelity, a party of overworked\r\njournalists.\r\n\r\nWith their quills, or fingers, they scratched incessantly, spattering ink\r\nin every direction, and sheet after sheet was covered with what looked\r\nnot unlike a stenographer’s notes.\r\n\r\nWhen the paper was sufficiently bespattered with ink it was passed to\r\na venerable old monkey, who occupied a single desk at the further end\r\nof the room, and he, after examining it intently, affixed one of those\r\nlittle, red-paper seals which are used on legal documents. Then it was\r\nhanded to a monkey stationed just outside the door, and by him passed\r\nalong a line, precisely as the wood at the volcano had been, save that,\r\nso far as Philip could understand, the messengers were sent toward the\r\nsea-coast.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of ten or fifteen minutes the same paper was returned\r\nto the house and handed to Goliah, who, with an air of greatest wisdom,\r\nscanned it carefully. Then he in turn passed it to another old ape in\r\nan adjoining room, who was probably a register of deeds, a recorder of\r\nwills, or whatever title is bestowed upon the keeper of monkey documents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE BABOON TASK-MASTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what he saw in this private counting-room Philip was convinced that\r\nthe apes were trying to imitate scenes which they had witnessed before\r\nthe unaccountable dispersion of the colony.\r\n\r\nDuring Captain Seaworth’s stay upon the island, and while laying out\r\nwork on the plantations, he most likely had occasion to transmit many\r\nwritten messages to his assistants, who were probably scattered over a\r\nconsiderable extent of territory; therefore Goliah and his companions\r\nmust have seen very often that which they were portraying so grotesquely.\r\n\r\nThe big baboon, either from a desire to see the greatest possible number\r\nof servants at work or because the dispatches were not brought back fast\r\nenough to occupy all his time, had apparently decided to make Philip\r\nhis chief clerk, for he gave orders—or so the prisoner supposed, from\r\nthe cries which were uttered—and one of the scribblers vacated his seat\r\nat the table. To this the animal-trainer was led. A package of paper\r\nand several quill-pens were placed before him, and from the expressive\r\ngestures indulged in by all the party there could be no question but that\r\nhe was commanded to cover the blank sheets with something which had a\r\nsemblance to writing.\r\n\r\nPhilip was not in a position to rebel. In fact, this treatment was so\r\ndifferent from what he had expected that he felt an intense relief at\r\nlearning the punishment was to be so slight. Before being allowed to\r\ncease work, however, he had good proof that his life was to be quite the\r\nreverse of an easy one.\r\n\r\nDuring the first hour he worked with reasonable industry, cheered by the\r\nhope that in so doing he might, through some unlooked-for chance, bring\r\nhuman beings to his aid. In bold, legible handwriting he covered each\r\nsheet with this brief appeal for assistance:\r\n\r\n    Philip Garland, a merchant from New York, shipwrecked on this\r\n    island, is held captive by a large troop of apes, who have\r\n    taken possession of cottages erected by Captain Seaworth.\r\n    Should this, by chance, fall into the hands of his countrymen,\r\n    they are asked in the name of mercy and humanity to aid him in\r\n    escaping.\r\n\r\nThere was a bare possibility that some of these documents might be lost\r\nby the messengers and found by those who would try to aid him. Improbable\r\nthough such a contingency was, it served to cheer him at his work, and\r\nGoliah appeared pleased because of the rapidity with which the sheets\r\nwere returned.\r\n\r\nWhen an hour had passed, however, he not only grew weary, but dispirited,\r\nand would have stopped had not two apes, who were stationed directly\r\nbehind his chair evidently by the big baboon’s orders, signified in the\r\nmost emphatic manner that he was to continue the work. One boxed his ears\r\nsoundly, while the other pointed toward the paper with harsh cries, which\r\nwere echoed by Goliah in a more commanding tone.\r\n\r\nThere was to be no cessation in this dispatch-writing, and with a groan\r\nPhilip resumed his labors, only to be subjected to the most violent usage\r\nwhenever he faltered in the task.\r\n\r\nThe day passed with the animal-trainer still at the table, his head\r\naching and his fingers cramped so that he could hardly hold the pen. He\r\nhad long since ceased to write appeals for help, but covered the paper\r\nwith any kind of marks made at random. Twice during the afternoon he\r\nceased his labors because of sheer weariness, and on both occasions not\r\nonly the two apes behind his chair, but all their companions in the room,\r\npinched his arms, pulled his hair, struck heavy blows on his head, or\r\nscratched his face with their sharp claws.\r\n\r\nNight came, and although it was not possible for him to see the marks\r\nleft by the pen, his guards kept vigilant watch, forcing him by the most\r\nsevere punishment to continue until the light of another dawn illumined\r\nthe room wherein half a hundred vindictive animals watched for the least\r\nsign of faltering on the part of their unhappy prisoner.\r\n\r\nIt was when he believed it would be absolutely impossible to hold the\r\nquill between his nerveless fingers another moment that the sound of a\r\nbell from some remote portion of the building caused every ape to leave\r\nthe room, and Philip staggered to his feet like one on the verge of\r\nexhaustion.\r\n\r\nDuring these twenty-four hours he had blackened many quires of paper,\r\nand each sheet had passed from one ape to another, probably making half\r\nthe circuit of the island before it was returned to Goliah. But now his\r\nlabors were ended for the time being, at least, and he ran down the\r\nstairs as if thinking this bell summoned him to the breakfast he so\r\nardently desired.\r\n\r\nThe two sentinels behind his chair had not ceased their duties of\r\noverseers, but in Goliah’s absence it was evident they did not dare to\r\nrestrain his movements; and thus, comparatively free in a dwelling filled\r\nwith brute enemies, he was allowed to proceed unmolested until he arrived\r\nat the veranda in the rear of the building, where an old ape was tugging\r\nvigorously at a bell attached to a post.\r\n\r\nThis veranda led into what might be called a court-yard, around each side\r\nof which were long, low buildings, probably used as sleeping-apartments\r\nfor Captain Seaworth’s crew and clerks. The yard was covered with an\r\nawning, and in the center had been built a small pond, bordered with\r\nthe tropical plants which grew in such profusion on the island. Here\r\nand there a banana-tree upreared its glossy leaves, and at irregular\r\nintervals smooth trunks of the bamboo thrust their delicate foliage\r\nthrough apertures made in the awning.\r\n\r\nIt was a place where wearied workers might seek rest from their toil, and\r\nundoubtedly Captain Seaworth had caused it to be so arranged for his own\r\nespecial enjoyment.\r\n\r\nAn air of homeliness at variance with what Philip had already witnessed\r\nwas presented in the person of an old monkey seated near the shore of the\r\nminiature pond holding her baby, while she watched, with all the care and\r\nconsiderably more than the tenderness of our imported French nurses, over\r\nseveral little monkeys who were not yet old enough to run about alone.\r\n\r\nSuch was the view from the veranda looking into the court-yard. Gazing\r\nin the opposite direction, however, a less interesting spectacle was\r\npresented. Philip was standing just outside of what had evidently served\r\nas Captain Seaworth’s dining-room. Here the tables had been spread by the\r\nmonkey attendants, or left by the domestics originally employed in the\r\nhouse, and the scene of disorder may be imagined. Plates were scattered\r\nabout in every direction—on the floor, the chairs and the window-sills.\r\nBroken glassware and crockery rendered walking dangerous unless one’s\r\nfeet were well protected. Knives, forks, spoons, tumblers, bottles and\r\nfragments of food were strewn over the room in the greatest profusion.\r\n\r\nAmid all this disorder, even as Philip stood gazing about with surprise\r\nand dismay written on his face, Goliah strutted into the room and seated\r\nhimself in the very middle of the table, while his immediate following\r\nclustered around him, some on the floor, others on chairs, and the two\r\nold advisers occupied either end of the festive-board.\r\n\r\nPhilip’s hunger was too great to admit of his being fastidious. None of\r\nthe monkey-guests appeared to pay any particular attention to him, and he\r\nentered in the hope of finding food which was yet in a condition to be at\r\nleast palatable.\r\n\r\nAll evidence of the cook’s skill, however, had long since been devoured\r\nor destroyed. The apes were eating raw vegetables, corn and leaves. The\r\nleaders of the party were feasting on a peculiar bark which had been\r\nfreshly stripped from the trees, and was evidently considered as a choice\r\nmorsel. They were by no means averse to their human servant partaking of\r\nthe delicacy, and were even painfully hospitable, acting on their usual\r\nrule of all engaging in the same occupation at the same time.\r\n\r\nSeveral gathered around Philip, and with manners more forcible than\r\npolite thrust into his mouth pieces of the bark, vegetables which\r\nresembled yams, and even going so far, in their eagerness, as to push\r\ntwo or three pieces of crockery between his teeth. In order to make\r\ncertain that he was getting his full share, one venerable monkey held his\r\nmouth open that the others might more quickly satisfy his hunger, and it\r\nrequired very violent exertions on his part to prevent being choked to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nFortunately for him, before the entire party could indulge in this\r\nalleged hospitable work a number of apes entered the room bearing large\r\nquantities of the favorite bark, and a frantic rush was made by all the\r\nfeasters, which resulted in his being neglected for the moment.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy his hunger with the articles of food here in the dining-room\r\nwas impossible, while to remain might be to subject himself to a diet of\r\ncrockery and glassware; therefore, at a moment when he fancied himself\r\nunnoticed, he stole softly out of the window into the court-yard, and\r\ncontinued on to the further end, where was a sign over one of the doors\r\nbearing the word “Kitchen.”\r\n\r\nNot alone did he go, however, for the counselors on the table seeing his\r\ndeparture ran quickly after him, and in a twinkling every occupant of\r\nthe dining-room was at his heels—not for the purpose of restraining his\r\nmovements, but to learn what would be done.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this unpleasant retinue, if possible, he darted into an\r\napartment midway between the kitchen and the veranda, which was evidently\r\nCaptain Seaworth’s sitting-room. Here the work of destruction had not\r\nbeen so complete. Several chairs were yet in serviceable condition, while\r\na violin, two guitars and a banjo hung on the walls with no marks of\r\nhaving been touched by the long-tailed invaders.\r\n\r\nPhilip did not delay in this room, however, since food was the one object\r\nof his desires, and he passed through several apartments until the\r\nkitchen was finally reached.\r\n\r\nTo this place the instincts of the apes were sufficient to give them\r\nfree access. The doors of the cupboards were yet closed, for the\r\ninvaders had not been able to unfasten the catches. The marks of their\r\nvain attempts in this direction, however, were written plainly in long\r\nscratches across the doors, as if they had been seeking for some secret\r\nspring, overlooking entirely the buttons and bolts.\r\n\r\nEvery member of the party from the dining-room was close at his heels\r\nwhen he opened the first of the cupboards and found it filled with all\r\nkinds of canned meats, poultry, vegetables, sardines, jam, milk, and\r\nother delicacies which were probably intended for the officers of the\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous article in the closet was a huge jar of preserved\r\nginger which had most likely been taken on board during the latter\r\nportion of the voyage, and this immediately attracted Goliah’s attention.\r\nThe lid was partially off, and with one blow of his paw he dislodged it\r\nentirely, thrusting his head into the jar up to the shoulders.\r\n\r\nHis followers, envious of his good fortune, and not being able to procure\r\nfor themselves anything from this newly-discovered hoard because of the\r\nnarrowness of the door, seized their leader by the tail, pulling him from\r\none side of the room to the other regardless of his efforts to remain\r\nquiet long enough to enjoy the unexpected feast.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course the baboon was dragged over no inconsiderable\r\nspace; but he managed to keep his head within the neck of the jar,\r\nand his zealous subjects only succeeded in rolling both him and the\r\nsweetmeats about, his hairy shoulders completely filling the mouth of the\r\nvessel so that none of the contents were spilled.\r\n\r\nPhilip was entirely neglected during this strife in which every member\r\nof the brute company took part, and it was evident the struggle would be\r\nended only when Goliah’s tail was pulled out, the jar broken, or his head\r\nremoved from its sweet resting-place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nA MONKEY-FEAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring five minutes Philip watched the struggle between Goliah and\r\nhis subjects with no slight amusement. The baboon’s long tail made an\r\nexcellent handle, and by the aid of it the apes swung him around and\r\naround, with the jar still covering his head, in what was at the same\r\ntime a most laughable and dangerous manner.\r\n\r\nIt would have been possible for the baboon to release himself at any\r\nmoment by loosening his hold of the jar; but the dainties to be found\r\ntherein were too enticing to be relinquished so readily, and without\r\nprotest he allowed himself to be flung from one side of the room to the\r\nother, he eating greedily all the while.\r\n\r\nThis struggle was not confined to the baboon and those who were swinging\r\nhim around in such a lively fashion. It was only possible for half a\r\ndozen of his followers to grasp the tail, and the others were not content\r\nto remain simply as spectators when there was a possible opportunity to\r\ngorge themselves. The two old counselors had managed to seize the jar,\r\nbut their united efforts were not sufficient to wrest it from Goliah;\r\nyet, having smeared their fingers with the juice which trickled over the\r\nleader’s shoulders, both were wildly eager to gain possession of some\r\nportion of the dainty.\r\n\r\nNor were they the only ones possessed with the same desire. The entire\r\ncompany seemed to have but one idea, which was to partake of preserved\r\nginger at the earliest possible moment, and before five minutes elapsed\r\nthere was every indication of an extensive riot. Each ape had begun to\r\nstruggle with his neighbor, urged on alike by his love of sweetmeats and\r\nhis instincts of imitation.\r\n\r\nNow, while Philip would have welcomed the sudden death of the huge baboon\r\nwho held him captive, he was by no means disposed to have the party\r\nengage in deadly combat if it could be avoided. He knew full well that\r\nbefore the fight had progressed very far one or more of the company would\r\nseize upon him; and in this encounter, where heads were pounded against\r\nthe wall without any regard to the thickness of skull, he would stand in\r\nvery much the same position as did the fragile vase when the bull made\r\nhis way into the china-shop.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there was but one jar of preserved ginger, and although he\r\nheld out glass after glass of the jam and other preserves, not a single\r\nmember of the party accepted the gift. Each was looking for a prize of\r\nthe same size as that in Goliah’s possession, and nothing smaller would\r\nsatisfy his ambition.\r\n\r\nThen Philip attempted to leave the room, thinking they might follow, or\r\nthat he would at least be free; but this was a movement impossible of\r\nexecution owing to the whirling apes between him and the door, and any\r\nretreat was out of the question because the closet was too narrow to\r\nserve as a place of refuge.\r\n\r\nEach second the strife waxed warmer, until it seemed as if the apartment\r\nwas filled with monkeys of all sizes, who were being swung in the air by\r\ntheir tails; and more than once was Philip knocked down by the heads or\r\narms of these living missiles.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when he had given up all hope of being able to check the\r\nwild scramble his eyes lighted upon a bag of nuts. In a twinkling he\r\nemptied them on the floor, and in an equally short space of time the\r\nconfusion ceased as every ape began to scramble for his share of the\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nGoliah was the only one who did not join in this last scene. When those\r\nwho had attached themselves to his tail let go their hold he was flung\r\ninto one corner of the room with the jar still pressed tightly to his\r\nshoulders, and there he remained, unheeded and unheeding, gorging himself\r\nwith the sweetmeats until the skin of his stomach was stretched as tight\r\nas the head of a drum.\r\n\r\nWhile the long-tailed company were enjoying this unwonted feast, and\r\nstrewing the floor thickly with nutshells, Philip made all haste to\r\nsatisfy his hunger. There were plenty of sardines in the way of solid\r\nfood, and these, with ship’s-biscuit, made a reasonably hearty meal,\r\nwhich he ate standing half in the cupboard, lest his companions should\r\nsuddenly become possessed of the idea to indulge in these oily delicacies\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, and before the other feasters had exhausted the supply\r\nof nuts, he held the closet-door only partially open, determined to shut\r\nand lock it when his hunger was appeased, for he knew full well it would\r\nbe but the work of a few seconds for the apes to clear everything from\r\nthe shelves if they were given the opportunity.\r\n\r\nBut it was while taking the greatest precautions that he was in reality\r\nthe most careless.\r\n\r\nHaving eaten enough he desired to quench his thirst, and to that end\r\nhad broken the top from a bottle of wine, there being many cases in the\r\ncupboard. In the absence of a glass he was forced to use the bottle as\r\na drinking-vessel, and to do so it was necessary to raise it above his\r\nhead. He was thus obliged to turn partially around, forgetting the fact\r\nthat he was exhibiting himself to the company.\r\n\r\nBefore his thirst was assuaged he had painful evidence of his\r\nindiscretion. In the twinkling of an eye every ape ceased cracking nuts\r\nand leaped toward the closet, while Philip, taken thus by surprise, had\r\nnot time to shut the door. As a matter of course all the party could\r\nnot come within reach of the cupboard at the same moment, but those in\r\nadvance passed the wine-bottles to their companions in the rear until\r\nevery monkey had enough of this unusual beverage to make him tipsy in\r\nshort order.\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible Philip shut the cupboard-door; but it was a case\r\nof “locking the stable after the horse had been stolen,” and he looked\r\naround with dismay as he saw each of his long-tailed companions holding\r\na bottle to his mouth, evidently wondering how the stupid man could have\r\nfound so much satisfaction in what was to them very dry fun.\r\n\r\nThe fact that they did not know enough to draw the corks caused him to\r\nhope none of the party would succeed in getting any liquor; but in this\r\nhe was speedily disappointed.\r\n\r\nIt was one of Goliah’s advisers who, after watching Philip stealthily,\r\nhad begun the rush for the bottles, and this old fellow knew exactly how\r\ntheir prisoner had set about extracting the contents.\r\n\r\nThe aged ape struck off the head of the bottle with a potato-masher which\r\nwas on the table, and five minutes later the floor was strewn with broken\r\nglass, while every animal in the room except Goliah was busily engaged in\r\nmaking himself more brutish than nature intended.\r\n\r\nPhilip stood gazing at this apparently convivial company with dismay\r\nwritten on every feature of his countenance. If sober apes were\r\ndisagreeable companions, what would be the result when he was surrounded\r\nby three or four hundred drunken animals? There could be no question but\r\nthat they would be intoxicated when each had finished his bottle, and\r\nthen the position of the captive, already disagreeable, must necessarily\r\nbe increased a hundred-fold.\r\n\r\nIt was probably the silence of the feasters which aroused Goliah from\r\nhis ginger-dream. He withdrew his head, plentifully besmeared with the\r\nsaccharine liquid, to gaze stupidly about him, while pieces of the\r\npreserves hung from his nose, ears and eyebrows in the most picturesque\r\nfashion. Gorged though he was, the sweet repast did not suffice when his\r\nfollowers had something different, and with one bound he leaped upon the\r\nsmallest monkey-toper. To choke the astonished little reveler and wrest\r\nhis bottle from him was but the work of a moment, and then the king of\r\nthe island began his vinous portion of the feast.\r\n\r\nNow, as if he had not already done himself sufficient injury, Philip\r\nspeedily set the example of a yet more alarming phase in this monkey orgy.\r\n\r\nAngry because of what he had unwittingly done he dashed his empty bottle\r\nagainst the cupboard-door.\r\n\r\nThis example was contagious. In another instant every ape was busily\r\nengaged in belaboring his companions with bottles, and fragments of glass\r\nflew in all directions.\r\n\r\nNow, more than ever, was it difficult to leave the apartment. The\r\nhailstorm of glass was so thick as almost to obscure the vision, and\r\nPhilip crouched behind the cooking-stove to protect himself from the\r\nflying particles.\r\n\r\nTwo seconds later a groan of horror burst from his lips, for every one\r\nof the half-drunken monkeys immediately conceived it necessary to do the\r\nsame thing, and he was undermost in the living stack, each member of\r\nwhich continued to beat the other with such fragments of glass as had\r\nsurvived the first onslaught.\r\n\r\nIt seemed certain he would be crushed to death—crushed between two or\r\nthree hundred quarts of wine encased in apes’ skins, and each of these\r\nanimated bottles writhing, twisting and scratching to get undermost.\r\n\r\nIt was fully fifteen minutes before Philip could so far extricate himself\r\nas to be able once more to divert the attention of the party, and then he\r\nseized the first possible means of deliverance. Wresting a half-shattered\r\nbottle from the clutch of the nearest ape, he threw it toward the window,\r\nand, as a natural consequence, every monkey about him struggled to his\r\nfeet that he might repeat the movement.\r\n\r\nWhile this afforded him some slight relief, it was decidedly a dangerous\r\nexperiment. The wine had begun its work, and the apes were now so\r\nthoroughly intoxicated as to have no idea of direction.\r\n\r\nInstead of hurling the sharp fragments through the window, as Philip\r\nintended they should, the long-tailed drunkards threw them at the doors,\r\nthe stove, or their companions, until one would have thought himself in a\r\nfierce storm, where hail-stones were replaced by glass.\r\n\r\nTo remain upright without great danger of being seriously wounded, if not\r\nkilled, was impossible, and he who had begun this last and most dangerous\r\namusement was forced to throw himself on the floor to avoid the flying\r\nparticles.\r\n\r\nAgain did he witness another painful proof of an ape’s power of\r\nimitation. In a twinkling every animal in the room threw himself on the\r\nfloor, and once more did Philip find himself the “under dog in the fight.”\r\n\r\nHe was wounded in numberless places from the claws of his companions or\r\nthe fragments of glass, and yet, whether he arose or remained passive,\r\nthere was still the sad satisfaction of knowing that it was he, and he\r\nalone, who set the fashion in this kingdom of apes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nAN APISH ORGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt required ten minutes of difficult work before Philip could succeed\r\nin leaving the room where he had thoughtlessly done so much mischief,\r\nand then, with all the drunken apes close at his heels, he ran into\r\nthe court-yard and threw himself on the bank of the tiny stream, so\r\nthoroughly disheartened as to be careless of what further trouble might\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nThe scene which was presented under the awning during the next half-hour\r\nwould have given a disinterested spectator no slight amount of amusement,\r\nbut in Philip’s eyes it was too painful to admit of even a smile.\r\n\r\nThe party were seated as near the border of the pond as possible, and\r\nto have some idea of the picture the reader should multiply any grossly\r\nintoxicated person he has seen by about four hundred; but even then, and\r\nwith the most vivid imagination, he could hardly do full justice to the\r\nspectacle.\r\n\r\nThey leered at each other, called names in the monkey language, very\r\nlikely told improbable stories, and argued after the fashion of men. Here\r\nand there a party of a dozen were raising their voices in discordant\r\nnotes, which was not unlike the maudlin singing of human beings. Now and\r\nthen one would stagger back and forth in a vain attempt to get nearer\r\nthe pond, while his companions did all in their power to keep him back.\r\nThen an ape, catching a glimpse of his own tail, and believing that it\r\nbelonged to his neighbor, would seize and pull it until he literally\r\noverturned himself. If in falling he struck any other member of the\r\nparty, an incipient riot was started, but not to continue very long,\r\nowing to the inebriated condition of all.\r\n\r\nThose nearest the prisoner overwhelmed him with rough caresses, which\r\nat times threatened to leave him entirely bald, because of the desire\r\nto show affection by examining each particular hair on his head. If\r\nthey had understood the custom and significance of hand-shaking, the\r\nanimal-trainer’s troubles would have been much greater; but as it was,\r\nhe had even more in the way of trials than could be borne with any\r\nrespectable show of equanimity.\r\n\r\nTaking the scene as a whole, and knowing exactly how these disagreeable\r\ncompanions had been made more brutish than was natural, it presented such\r\na lesson as Philip must have profited by, for one cannot see even drunken\r\nmen without realizing the beauties and benefits of temperance.\r\n\r\nTo move ever so slightly was to find the others doing the same thing, and\r\nPhilip waited patiently throughout the whole of that long, dreary day,\r\nhoping his companions would soon be wrapped in slumber, when he might\r\nmake his escape to the grotto.\r\n\r\nBut he waited in vain. At intervals certain members of the party would\r\ndoze; but there was no moment when more than fifty were in a state even\r\napproaching unconsciousness, although the entire troop grew more quiet,\r\nif not more sober, when the shadows of night began to gather.\r\n\r\nProbably no man ever so desired to escape observation as did Philip,\r\nwhen, just after sunset, he arose cautiously and made his way toward the\r\nkitchen in the hope of being able to penetrate that portion of the house,\r\nwhere he might find some degree of privacy. Surely, there should be a\r\nsmall apartment in which he could barricade himself, and it was with this\r\nin his mind that he entered the building.\r\n\r\nHere, however, the gloom was already filling the room—for night in the\r\ntropics comes on very rapidly—rendering some artificial light necessary.\r\nWith every reason to believe there might be lamps or candles in the\r\ncupboard he opened the door once more, closing it very suddenly as the\r\nentire body of apes rushed in, ready for any further mischief which might\r\npresent itself.\r\n\r\nPhilip stood for an instant with his back to the closet, wondering if\r\nit would be safe to make any investigations while his companions were\r\nso near, and as he faced the party it was impossible to check his mirth\r\ndespite all the reasons he had for sorrow.\r\n\r\nThe monkey-topers, now partially recovered from the effects of the wine,\r\nwere looking thoroughly demoralized and repentant. Some were holding\r\ntheir paws to their heads as if to check the pain, while others appeared\r\nto be suffering most in the region of the stomach. The majority of the\r\nparty yet walked unsteadily, and at short intervals squads of from ten to\r\ntwenty would return to the pond in order to quench the unnatural thirst\r\nwhich was causing them to feel very wretched.\r\n\r\nUnder such a condition of affairs Philip believed that his followers were\r\nincapable of any serious mischief, and, holding the cupboard door only\r\npartially open, he reached inside for the purpose of providing himself\r\nwith a light.\r\n\r\nAgain chance aided, and the apes outwitted him. His hand struck the lid\r\nof a box, and, displacing the cover, he found that it was filled with\r\ncandles, while piled in one corner immediately behind it was a quantity\r\nof matches.\r\n\r\nNow it became necessary to use both hands, and with one he extracted a\r\ncandle from the box, while with the other he ignited the wick.\r\n\r\nThis movement necessarily prevented him from retaining his hold on the\r\ncupboard-door, and the half-sobered apes in the rear immediately seized\r\nupon the opportunity. Philip’s candle was but just lighted when with a\r\nrush they dashed into the closet, and behold! three hundred apes each\r\nwith a candle and a package of matches, forming a cordon around Philip,\r\nand making the air heavy with brimstone as they rubbed the “fire-sticks”\r\non the doors, floor, stove, or more than once on their own hides. As\r\nPhilip had done so did every ape in the room, and with the most alarming\r\nconsequences. Now and then one less sober than his companions would\r\nignite a full bunch of matches, much to his alarm and confusion. As a\r\nmatter of course, such a blunderer immediately threw the blazing bits of\r\nwood to the floor, thereby causing the animal-trainer no slight fear, for\r\nit was impossible to say when the others might not do the same thing.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if this was the culmination of all Philip’s troubles, for\r\nto place a match and candle in the hands of a sober ape is to supply\r\nthe means of a conflagration, and what must be the result when these\r\ndangerous things are controlled by intoxicated brutes?\r\n\r\nPhilip’s first thought was to extinguish his own candle; but even while\r\non the point of doing so it flashed into his mind that by causing the\r\nflame to disappear he might seem to have thrown it away, and then would\r\nensue a scene similar to the one with the bottles, making the immediate\r\ndestruction of the building inevitable.\r\n\r\nIt was plain that, having thus far committed himself to the necessity\r\nof artificial light, he must retain possession of it, and he made great\r\nshow of holding it carefully in both hands—a movement which was at once\r\nimitated by the others, but not so cleverly as would have been the case\r\nunder other circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe result of this precaution was that at least one ape out of every\r\nthree burned his paws, while the other two singed their nearest neighbors\r\nuntil the odor of burning hair was almost stifling.\r\n\r\nNow the room resounded with cries of pain, and those who had been\r\nburned belabored the party next to them, regardless of whether they had\r\ninflicted the injuries or not, until the entire throng were flogging\r\neach other with these tiny flames, scattering wicks and tallow in every\r\ndirection, while the blazing of hair added to the general illumination.\r\n\r\nPhilip realized that something must be done immediately, and he forced\r\nhis way out through the drunken crowd to the court-yard, going from there\r\nto the sitting-room with the intention of gaining the street.\r\n\r\nThe door to this last apartment was fastened, however, and in order to\r\npush back the bolts he placed his candle on the window-sill.\r\n\r\nBefore five seconds had elapsed every portion of the room was\r\ndecorated with lighted candles, and for the time being all danger of a\r\nconflagration was averted, while the apes themselves gave evidence of\r\nbeing in some familiar place.\r\n\r\nIt was probable that Captain Seaworth had given a party, or sanctioned\r\na gathering of his officers and the colonists, when the room had been\r\nilluminated after this same fashion, and equally probable that the apes\r\nwere spectators, at some time in the past, of the scene from the outside.\r\n\r\nThey exchanged glances with each other, chattered noisily, and\r\ngesticulated vigorously, while Philip stood gazing at them in amazement,\r\nwondering what new phase of danger he was about to encounter.\r\n\r\nAn instant later four or five, whose memory was better than their\r\ncompanions’, seized upon the musical instruments which hung on the wall\r\nand began striking the strings with both hands and feet, while the\r\nothers, each with a partner, whirled, leaped and shouted as they went\r\nthrough with the movements of a dance. One couple would dart up and down\r\nthe room, taking about four strides to cover the entire distance; another\r\nset circled around and around within a circumscribed space; and yet more\r\nstood bowing and scraping, until, had the scene been presented on the\r\nstage of a theater, it would have called forth the most generous applause.\r\n\r\nEvery detail of a ball-room was here depicted after a certain apish\r\nfashion, and the fact that at least half the company wore some portion of\r\nclothing lent a decided air of realism to the scene.\r\n\r\nThe amateur musicians were most industrious, and since their idea of\r\nperfect harmony was the greatest possible amount of noise, the result can\r\nbe imagined. Their facilities for playing were much greater than man’s.\r\nFor instance, a huge ape who had taken one of the banjos was seated on\r\nthe floor holding it with his left foot, while the right and both hands\r\nwere used to strike resounding blows on the strings. The performer on the\r\nguitar had pressed into service a small monkey as assistant, and while\r\nthe latter held the instrument above his head, the musician used hands\r\nand tail with which to draw forth wild and discordant strains.\r\n\r\nGoliah had left the apartment immediately the dance began, and Philip’s\r\nidea was that he had simply gone to station sentinels around the building\r\nto prevent his escape; therefore he remained in one corner of the room,\r\nhidden as far as possible from the merry-makers, not daring to show the\r\nleast desire to quit the scene of the festivities.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the party did not appear to be at all disturbed by the\r\nabsence of their leader. They waltzed, polkaed, bowed and promenaded,\r\nchatting gaily meanwhile; but after half an hour of this sport the\r\ngreater number followed the big baboon’s example, until not more than\r\ntwenty couples were left to go through the motions of keeping time to the\r\ndiscordant braying of the instruments.\r\n\r\nIf Philip deluded himself with the idea that they were growing tired, and\r\nthat he would speedily find an opportunity of making his escape, he was\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\nIn less than a quarter of an hour the outer doors were thrown open with a\r\ncrash, and the animal-trainer looked up in astonishment to see entering\r\nthe room what at first glance appeared to be a party of richly-dressed\r\nladies and gentlemen.\r\n\r\nThere were half a hundred apes wearing muslin, silk and calico dresses;\r\nsome with shawls, others with bonnets, and not a few carrying gloves in\r\ntheir hands, all attended by male escort clad in a variety of costumes.\r\n\r\nIt was Goliah who led this brilliant party, and leaning on his arm, but\r\nlooking terrified, was Sweet Alice, who had evidently been forced by\r\nthe baboon to take part in the merry-making while her mate remained a\r\nprisoner in the cage.\r\n\r\nAfter what Philip had already witnessed there was no trouble in divining\r\nwhere these costumes had come from. The memory of a similar scene, when\r\nthe colonists had appeared dressed in their best, was probably so vivid\r\nin the minds of the apes that the houses of the settlement had been\r\nimmediately ransacked for a supply of finery.\r\n\r\nHad Philip been able to so far disassociate himself from the painful fact\r\nthat he was a captive, and become once more a student of natural history,\r\nhe would have received a most interesting lesson regarding the point\r\nwhere instinct ceases and mental effort begins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nINCONVENIENT MEMORIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to this time those of the apes who had once been articles of\r\nmerchandise in Philip Garland’s establishment gave no signs of\r\nremembering their past treatment, and he congratulated himself, even amid\r\nhis troubles, that they did not take it into their apish heads to put him\r\nthrough the same course of training as he formerly practiced.\r\n\r\nThis lack of memory was only temporary, however, as he soon had the best\r\nof reasons to know, and never did a man repent more bitterly his attempts\r\nat animal-training than Philip on this eventful evening, while his\r\nlong-tailed hosts were indulging in the gayeties of a ball.\r\n\r\nThe sport was at its height. The partially-clad apes were whirling around\r\nthe room, evidently enjoying the dance as much as ever their masters and\r\nmistresses did; and Philip stood in one corner, hidden by the throng,\r\nwatching for an opportunity to make his escape through one of the\r\nhalf-opened windows leading to the front veranda. He believed the apes\r\nhad for the time being forgotten him, but in this he made a sad mistake.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a large monkey, who had formed a part of the collection sold\r\nto Captain Seaworth’s officers, came close to his old master. Philip\r\nrecognized him as one whom he had taught, after much labor and many\r\nblows, to play the banjo, and from the expression of the animal’s face he\r\nunderstood that further trouble for himself was near at hand.\r\n\r\nThe monkey scanned him so long and intently that half a score of the\r\ndancers ceased their sport and gathered around, full of curiosity to\r\nlearn what was to be done with this specimen of the human tribe.\r\n\r\nIt was as if the animal had tried to attract the attention of his\r\ncomrades. When there was a sufficient number around to prevent any\r\npossibility of the animal-trainer’s escape, the monkey went to that\r\nportion of the room where one of the banjos was hanging, and, taking down\r\nthe instrument, thrust it into Philip’s hands as he uttered a hoarse cry\r\nin a commanding voice.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the other members of the company who had formerly belonged\r\nto Philip’s establishment gathered around in high glee, and there could\r\nbe no mistake as to their intentions. As the animal-trainer had taught\r\nhis articles of merchandise, so now they were going to teach him, and the\r\nlesson would unquestionably be painful as well as humiliating.\r\n\r\nFor an instant Philip’s pride prevented him from playing the part of\r\nmusician to the monkey-dancers, and he shook his head as if to say it was\r\nimpossible. Almost at the same moment he regretted having refused, for\r\nthe monkey immediately struck him across the face with the instrument,\r\ndealing such a blow as sent the unfortunate captive staggering back\r\nagainst the wall.\r\n\r\nAgain was the punishment about to be repeated, but before the blow could\r\nbe delivered Philip suddenly remembered how to play, and, swallowing\r\nhis pride as best he could, took the banjo, running his fingers lightly\r\nacross the strings.\r\n\r\nAt this new phase in the game of monkey-turned-trainer Goliah joined the\r\nparty, and his memory proved to be even more perfect than that of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIt had been Philip’s greatest achievement in the education of these\r\nanimals to form a trio, each ape performing on a different instrument;\r\nand in order that the picture should be correct, Goliah called two of\r\nthose who were playing for the dancers to range themselves on either side\r\nof his late master.\r\n\r\nThus behold the youth whose proudest boast had been that he could train\r\nany animal, however ferocious, seated between two enormous baboons,\r\nstrumming on a banjo as if his very life depended upon the amount of\r\nnoise produced.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to say that this was no enjoyment to him; but it\r\ncertainly was to the remainder of the party, and they grinned and\r\nchattered their approbation of the scene, while the one who had first\r\nstarted the sport stood directly behind the musician, armed with a long\r\nstick.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate captive jangled the strings without regard to harmony,\r\nand fondly fancied that this was the lowest humiliation he would be\r\nforced to bear. But his genial captors had a different opinion regarding\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\nOne of the party whom Philip had taught to climb a pole now seemed to\r\nenter into conversation with Goliah—who shall say that apes cannot\r\ntalk?—and a few moments later he and two others left the apartment.\r\n\r\nPhilip was playing industriously to save his back from the shower of\r\nblows which descended at the slightest diminution of noise, when the\r\nthree animals returned with a long, stout pole, and the musician dropped\r\nhis instrument, literally dazed with fear and bewilderment, for now\r\nhe understood what further sport he would be expected to make for the\r\nentertainment of this long-tailed party.\r\n\r\nWas he to be called upon to perform every trick which had been taught\r\nin his emporium of wild animals? If such should prove to be the case,\r\nthree days would hardly suffice in which to display all the varied\r\naccomplishments he had prided himself upon teaching, and in that time his\r\nexertions might prove fatal.\r\n\r\nCold streams of perspiration ran down his face, although the ball-room\r\nwas far from being warm, at the bare idea of the brutish part he was\r\ncalled upon to perform.\r\n\r\nThe pole was there, however, and Goliah’s two old counselors stood close\r\nbehind the prisoner, armed with long, pliant bamboos. Philip understood\r\nonly too well the purpose for which these whip-like sticks had been\r\nbrought.\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking the gestures with which they commanded the\r\nprisoner to climb the pole, and from the ingenious way of keeping it\r\nupright one would have fancied they had often performed the same feat for\r\ntheir own amusement.\r\n\r\nFive or six of the smaller apes seated themselves on the floor, holding\r\nthe pole at the base. Those of intermediate height grasped it with their\r\nhands a few inches from the bottom; while the tallest—which were the\r\nbaboons and mandrills—threw their gigantic arms above the others, and\r\nplanted their feet as props beyond the lower class.\r\n\r\nGoliah advanced toward the captive with an imperious air as he pointed to\r\nthe pole and then to the sticks held by the aged apes. Philip understood\r\nthat it would not be wise to hesitate much longer. In fact he received an\r\nimmediate and decided incentive to obey.\r\n\r\nJust as he was balancing himself preparatory to swinging over the living\r\npedestal, one of Goliah’s advisers struck him two severe blows, which had\r\nthe desired effect.\r\n\r\nEnraged, but yet fully realizing the danger of allowing his anger to\r\ndisplay itself, he leaped forward and commenced climbing.\r\n\r\nAlthough he may have been a thoroughly good teacher, it was not possible\r\nfor him to practice gracefully that which he taught; and despite his\r\nmost frantic efforts to ascend beyond reach of the bamboo poles which\r\nthe old apes kept constantly in motion, he could not succeed in climbing\r\nmore than a few feet above the heads of those who held the pole. He would\r\nclamber up five or six inches, only to slip back the same distance, or\r\nfurther, and all the while the lower portion of his body was a fair\r\ntarget for his tormentors.\r\n\r\nHe now deeply regretted ever having attempted to train a monkey to climb\r\na pole, and still more bitter were his regrets that he had used for this\r\npurpose a stout whip with which to belabor his pupils exactly as they\r\nwere now belaboring him.\r\n\r\nThe sport of dancing was entirely forgotten in this new amusement, and\r\neach member of the party seemed to think it the height of pleasure to\r\naid Goliah’s counselors in their efforts to make matters lively for the\r\nanimal-trainer.\r\n\r\nHe climbed and slipped back, raising himself as the blows grew more\r\nfurious, and then, despite all efforts, fell on the heads of those who\r\nwere holding the instrument of torture. His trousers and coat were torn\r\nalmost to tatters, and his skin scratched and bleeding. He was literally\r\nin rags before a quarter of an hour had elapsed, and so thoroughly\r\nexhausted as to be on the point of rebelling, regardless of the severe\r\npunishment which would inevitably follow, when a lucky accident put an\r\nend to this form of misery.\r\n\r\nUnder the incentive of blows more severe than the preceding ones, he\r\nleaped upward and at the same time sideways, grasping the pole higher\r\nthan before. By this means his weight was thrown at an angle, and the\r\ntimber gave way in the middle.\r\n\r\nThe most comical antics of a clown in a circus would not have called\r\nforth such applause as that which greeted Philip when he fell bruised and\r\nbleeding upon the floor, while the entire company, even those who were\r\nclad in the greatest profusion of fineries, had a jolly game of leap-frog\r\nover his prostrate body.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he fancied this signal failure would cause his tormentors to\r\nrelinquish the one-sided sport; but he forgot that among the animals sold\r\nto Captain Seaworth was his most accomplished pupil, who was now burning\r\nwith a desire to do his share toward training the teacher.\r\n\r\nPhilip had remained as he fell, with his face buried in his arms to\r\nshield it from blows, when a vicious switch across the back caused him to\r\nlook up.\r\n\r\nHe saw before him his talented pupil, for whom he had received an extra\r\nprice because of the proficiency gained, comically scratching his thigh,\r\ncapering in the air, thrusting his tongue out in a mocking fashion, and\r\nthen whirling about on his head with both feet spread apart like a bent\r\nfork. In fact this extremely lively animal was repeating all the grimaces\r\nand contortions which had been instilled into his memory with so many\r\nblows of the whip.\r\n\r\nThis part of the monkey’s performance was evidently for the benefit of\r\nthe spectators as well as Philip. He continued it several moments, and\r\nthen, bowing as he had been taught to do when receiving applause, stood\r\nstill, making the most imperative gestures to the prostrate youth.\r\n\r\nPhilip had climbed the pole because of the blows he had received, and\r\nalso because such a feat was, to a certain degree, within his power;\r\nbut to stand on his head and whirl around like a live teetotum was\r\nimpossible. He covered his face with his arms and remained motionless.\r\n\r\nThis immobility did not continue but a few seconds, for a hoarse scream\r\nfrom Goliah caused half a dozen of the apes to beat his body as if it\r\nhad been a drum, until, knowing he would be pounded to a jelly should he\r\ncontinue to disobey, he arose to his feet like one who had already tasted\r\nthe horrors of the whipping-post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nFROM THE FRYING-PAN TO THE FIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNever before did an unwilling performer have such an attentive and at\r\nthe same time odd-looking audience. Under other circumstances Philip\r\nwould have been convulsed with laughter at the scene presented in this\r\ndrawing-room; but just now it was anything rather than comical, and\r\nsorrow instead of mirth was imprinted upon his face. He, the redoubtable\r\ntrainer of animals, was about to attempt a handspring for a party of\r\napes, baboons, mandrills and monkeys!\r\n\r\nHardly knowing how to begin, he stood for a moment hesitating; but the\r\nsame means which had been employed to assist him in climbing the pole was\r\nbrought into requisition, until his limbs and back felt as if they had\r\nbeen treated to a bath of fire.\r\n\r\nThen the talented monkey turned one more somersault in front of Philip\r\nand stood in an expectant attitude. There was no question but that he\r\nintended the performance should be repeated, and the unfortunate youth\r\ndid his best to obey. He turned a somersault, and at the same time\r\ntwisted his spinal column until there was every reason to believe it was\r\ndislocated.\r\n\r\nThen the instructor stood on his head, and Philip was obliged to attempt\r\nthe same maneuver, but only to fail utterly. As a reward for his\r\nawkwardness the bamboo sticks once more descended in a shower.\r\n\r\nTo relate all the misery and sorrows of the hour which followed would be\r\nto tell one long tale of woe. Suffice it to say that as far as possible\r\nthe animal-trainer copied the movements of the demon-like monkey in front\r\nof him. He jumped through hoops, blew kisses to the audience, went around\r\nhat in hand begging for money, and realized, as never before, how much\r\nlabor his pupils had been forced to perform.\r\n\r\nAs he had shown anger when they failed, and treated them with liberal\r\ndoses of the whip, so did they give the same token of displeasure because\r\nof his awkward movements.\r\n\r\nThis painful and humiliating performance might have continued until it\r\nbecame literally an impossibility for Philip to raise either a hand or\r\nfoot, had it not been for an unexplained diversion.\r\n\r\nHe was thoroughly exhausted. It seemed that not even once more could he\r\ngo through the semblance of repeating his instructor’s example, and he\r\nbelieved that the time had come when his career on this earth would be\r\nended forever, under the castigation of the apes. At this supreme moment\r\na sudden uproar in the adjoining apartment caused the spectators in this\r\nnew school of ground and lofty tumbling to rush helter-skelter from the\r\nplace of amusement, and to his most intense relief the unhappy captive\r\nwas left alone.\r\n\r\nBruised, bleeding and exhausted as he was, nothing save the knowledge of\r\nhis imminent peril could have induced him to so much as raise a hand.\r\nNow, however, it was absolutely necessary, in order to save his life,\r\nthat he leave the village, and, limping painfully, he made his way\r\nthrough the window to the street.\r\n\r\nIn which direction the grotto lay he had no idea, because of the\r\nbewilderment that had come upon him during the past hour, and it was only\r\npossible to rush blindly forward into the jungle, taking no heed of his\r\nsteps save that each one carried him further away from the scene of his\r\nhumiliation and punishment.\r\n\r\nStumbling, falling, rising only to fall again, he pushed on amid the\r\ntangled foliage, nerved to almost superhuman exertions by the knowledge\r\nof what his fate might be in case an escape was not effected.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, hardly knowing whether he continued in a straight course\r\nor moved in a circle, he managed to press forward until the underbrush\r\nbecame more sparse, and hope again sprung up in his heart. He supposed he\r\nhad arrived at the banana grove, where it was possible to procure food,\r\nand from whence he would have but little difficulty in finding the grotto.\r\n\r\nBut for the fact that the events and ill-treatment of the evening had\r\ndazed him, he would have exercised more care while traveling over an\r\nunknown country. As it was, however, he walked blindly on, until he\r\nfound himself sinking amid the slime and water of a jungle marsh.\r\n\r\nThat which he had mistaken for the banana plantation was one of those\r\nopen morasses so frequent in this portion of the globe; and as the cold\r\nwater flowed around his aching body he realized the danger in which he\r\nhad thus incautiously placed himself.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to raise his feet and scramble back to more solid earth he\r\nsunk the deeper, and then reason gave way to fear.\r\n\r\nHe knew that any effort on his part would make the situation more\r\ndangerous; but this was forgotten in the frenzy which came upon him.\r\n\r\nAt the first plunge the water had only been within a few inches of his\r\nknees; in five minutes it was at his waist, his lower limbs being so\r\nimprisoned that any further movement of his feet was impossible.\r\n\r\nNow came a new cause for alarm. He had felt himself growing weak for\r\nseveral moments, but believing the faintness was caused by exertions made\r\nduring his rapid flight he paid no attention to the fact until, when held\r\nprisoner by the mud, he discovered that his hands, face and neck were\r\ncovered with what at first glance appeared to be small caterpillars, dark\r\nbrown in color and striped with vivid yellow.\r\n\r\nUnder the most favorable circumstances they were disgusting-looking\r\ncreatures; but now, when by reason of his dangerous position every\r\ndisagreeable object was magnified, they seemed positively repulsive. He\r\nattempted to brush away three or four which had fastened on the back of\r\nhis hand, and to his mingled surprise and horror they clung the tighter.\r\n\r\nTaking hold of one with his thumb and finger he was forced to use no\r\nslight amount of strength in removing it, and then a cry of terror burst\r\nfrom his lips as he discovered that the repulsive thing was sucking his\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nHe was covered with forest-leeches, which had attached themselves to\r\nhim during his flight through the woods, and his sudden and excessive\r\nweakness arose from the enormous quantities of life-blood which they had\r\ndrained from his veins. For the instant his dangerous predicament was\r\nforgotten in this new cause for alarm, and during five minutes he paid\r\nbut little attention to the fact that he was sinking deeper and deeper\r\ninto the mire while pulling the tiny vampires from his flesh.\r\n\r\nOnce these pests were removed, however, all the horrors of his situation\r\ncame upon him with redoubled force.\r\n\r\nHe was alone in a swamp, which continued to engulf him despite all\r\nefforts, and it seemed certain that life, so painful but a short time\r\nprevious, was about to be extinguished.\r\n\r\nHowever much one may wish for the approach of death, he instinctively\r\nstruggles against it when the summons comes. So it was with Philip. An\r\nhour ago suffocation in the marsh would have seemed preferable to the\r\ndangers by which he was surrounded; and yet, when the supreme moment was\r\nso near at hand, the desire for life became strong once more.\r\n\r\nAny efforts of his were useless, and to summon aid would be to call\r\naround him the enemies from whom he had been endeavoring to escape; but\r\nnow that it was a question of life or death, he did not hesitate.\r\n\r\nAgain and again he cried for help, knowing that if his words were not\r\nunderstood, those who had probably been sent in search of him would be\r\nattracted to the spot by his voice. The exertion necessary to make this\r\nappeal caused him to sink deeper and deeper in the treacherous mud, but\r\nhe continued to shout until the rustling of foliage warned him that help,\r\neven though attended by danger, was at hand.\r\n\r\nHe expected to see the grinning face of Goliah or some of his adherents,\r\nand even these would have been welcome; but to his inexpressible delight\r\nit was the faithful chimpanzee who had responded to his cry for help.\r\n\r\nAlice recognized his danger at once, and wasted no time in\r\ninvestigations. With one paw clutching the trunk of a tree, which grew on\r\nsolid ground, she extended the other to him, and he grasped it with the\r\nsame desperate energy that a drowning man does the plank pushed out to\r\nsave him from death.\r\n\r\nHis own strength would have been insufficient to release him from the\r\npredicament, for the mire had a hold stronger than human hands; but his\r\nrescuer was powerful of limb, and, as he clutched her wrist with both\r\nhands, she drew him safely to the shore.\r\n\r\nIt was several moments before he was able to make any movement toward\r\nleaving the place, and during all this while Alice intimated, by the\r\nexpression of her face as well as by her gestures of anxiety, that he\r\nshould follow her.\r\n\r\nWhen he had partially recovered from the exhaustion superinduced by his\r\nflight and subsequent struggles, Philip motioned for the chimpanzee to\r\nproceed, and at a rapid pace she led him through the jungle in, as he\r\nthought, the direction of the grotto.\r\n\r\nOnly once during this fatiguing journey did the animal halt, and then\r\nit was before a bubbling spring which, singularly enough in a land of\r\nluxuriant vegetation, stood in a space of at least a hundred square yards\r\nwhereon not so much as a blade of grass was growing.\r\n\r\nTo find on this island such an arid spot caused Philip surprise, even\r\nthough he was so distressed both in body and mind; but he was not in\r\na condition to search for the cause, and would have passed by without\r\nhalting, motioning to Alice that he was not thirsty, if she by her\r\ngestures had not insisted on his taking note of the water.\r\n\r\nThinking the best way to satisfy her would be to raise a few drops to his\r\nlips, he dipped his hand in the spring. Instead of feeling the grateful\r\ncontact of cool liquid upon his flesh, it seemed as if he had touched\r\ndiluted lye. It was slightly warm, not of a very pleasant odor, and as he\r\nattempted to rub the moisture from his fingers a lather like that made by\r\nsoap was produced.\r\n\r\nFor an instant he was at a loss to understand the meaning of this\r\napparent phenomenon, and then came the thought that he had heard his\r\nfriend, Captain Seaworth, speak of these soap-springs to be found in the\r\nMalay Archipelago. It was a discovery which he welcomed quite as gladly\r\nas though it had been pure water and he half-famished with thirst.\r\n\r\nHastily throwing off his clothes he plunged to the neck in the soapy\r\nliquid, and never before was a bath more refreshing to a weary mortal.\r\n\r\nLathering his flesh again and again, he washed away all traces of\r\nhis plunge in the swamp, and after rubbing himself thoroughly, felt\r\nthat delicious sense of cleanliness which is so refreshing. The only\r\ndifficulty was to rid himself of the soapy substance, for however often\r\nhe might plunge beneath the surface the foam would appear every time he\r\npassed his hand over his flesh, and it was only when in a partial state\r\nof dryness that he put on his clothes once more, making gestures to the\r\nchimpanzee that he was ready to continue the journey.\r\n\r\nAlthough monkeys are not supposed to wash themselves, it was quite\r\nevident she knew the properties of this water—perhaps from seeing some\r\nof the colonists use it—and Philip could not fail to wonder at the\r\nintelligence she displayed.\r\n\r\nAfter half an hour’s rapid traveling the astonishment of the fugitive can\r\nbe imagined when, instead of arriving at the grotto, he found himself\r\ninside the village.\r\n\r\nThis was the one spot of all others on the island which he wished to\r\navoid, and to the utmost of his ability he represented by gesture that it\r\nwas in the highest degree dangerous for him to go near Goliah.\r\n\r\nHad Alice been able to speak his language she could not have replied\r\nmore expressively. By her movements he was made to understand that his\r\nformer place of hiding was known to the huge baboon, and that it would be\r\npossible to secrete himself only in the very midst of his enemies.\r\n\r\n“What matters it?” he said to himself. “The chimpanzee can lead me into\r\nno greater danger than that to which I have already been exposed, and I\r\nwill follow her as confidently as I would a human being.”\r\n\r\nThen he motioned Alice to proceed, and she led the way, much to his\r\nsurprise, directly through the main street of the settlement, where not a\r\nsingle ape, monkey or baboon was to be seen.\r\n\r\nProbably all had gone in search of him, and, knowing this, Alice had\r\nformed her plans accordingly. She went directly to the house which he\r\nhad just left, and opened the door of the reception-room where he had\r\nexperienced so much humiliation and pain.\r\n\r\nThen, as if to say that her continued absence might excite suspicion, she\r\nmotioned to the doors and wooden shutters of the windows as if advising\r\nthat they be closed, and left him to his own reflections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nBESIEGED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe behavior of the chimpanzee, as well as his own good common sense,\r\nwhich he had had time to recover since the adventure in the marsh, told\r\nPhilip that it would be useless longer to fly from his enemies. He was\r\nin a building constructed with especial reference to safety from outside\r\nfoes, and by barricading himself in the series of rooms which led from\r\nthe kitchen to the parlor he might be able to stand a siege of many days.\r\n\r\nIt is true he had no reason to expect aid, since it seemed most likely\r\nCaptain Seaworth’s party had been massacred; but yet time to wait for the\r\ncoming of human companions was the one thing desired, and to such end he\r\nmade every preparation.\r\n\r\nOn this, as well as on the other side of the building, each window had\r\nheavy wooden shutters which could be closed from the inside, and the\r\ndoors were sufficiently stout to resist any attack which might be made\r\nby the apes. As a matter of course, a determined body of men with the\r\nproper tools could soon effect an entrance; but it was hardly probable\r\nthe animals would be able to break in after the place was once properly\r\nfortified.\r\n\r\nPhilip understood that there was no time to be lost, for at any moment\r\nGoliah and his forces might return. Therefore his first act was to shut\r\nand barricade the three doors leading to the veranda. Then the heavy\r\nshutters of the windows were closed and bolted, half a dozen candles were\r\nlighted, and the fortification was as nearly complete as he could make it.\r\n\r\nHe now experienced a sense of security such as had not visited him since\r\nthe moment when he was thrown upon these inhospitable shores. There was\r\non hand sufficient food to last a long time, and he felt safe from any\r\nimmediate danger.\r\n\r\nThe one thing needful at this moment was slumber, and with a mind free\r\nfrom apprehensions he made up such a bed in the dining-room as even a\r\nless weary youth would not have disdained, closing his eyes in peaceful\r\nsleep almost instantly after lying down.\r\n\r\nHe awakened in a calmer frame of mind than he had known since the time\r\nwhen the good bark Swallow first encountered the gale, and was fully\r\nalive to all the possibilities of his situation. He had no difficulty in\r\ncoming to the conclusion that so long as he was destined to remain on the\r\nisland he would be exposed to a vengeance worse than death at the hands\r\nof those whom he had once treated as articles of merchandise. At present\r\nhe believed himself to be perfectly secure; but as a matter of course,\r\nif he should dare to venture forth it would be to become the object of\r\nrenewed attacks, which very likely would end only in his death.\r\n\r\nIt was with such thoughts that his mind was occupied as he took from the\r\nkitchen cupboard a fresh supply of candles to replace those long since\r\nconsumed, and then examined his miniature fortress to see if there was\r\nany vulnerable point of attack which he had overlooked.\r\n\r\nThere was a second story, and through this it might be possible the apes\r\ncould effect an entrance, therefore he lost no time in examining the\r\nupper portion of his refuge.\r\n\r\nThe rooms above were of the same size as those on the ground-floor; but\r\ndirectly over the corner was a small bell-tower open on all four sides,\r\nand entered by a trap-door. This last was secured by two iron bolts\r\nwhich shut into mortices in the main timbers of the building, and, as he\r\nbelieved, were sufficiently strong to resist any ordinary attack.\r\n\r\nIt was in this corner apartment over the parlor that Captain Seaworth\r\nhad established his private office, and, strange to say, it had thus far\r\nescaped the observation of the apes. Everything was in the most complete\r\norder. The books, papers and boxes which filled the shelves on either\r\nside were as the commander of the ill-fated colony had left them. On\r\nthe writing-desk lay an unfinished letter to the stockholders of the\r\ncorporation, probably abandoned when the writer was called upon to resist\r\nthis army of apes.\r\n\r\nIt was not necessary for Philip to close the heavy window-shutters, for\r\nthey were already bolted, and in each was a sort of Venetian blind about\r\nfour inches square, which permitted a view of the surrounding country\r\nwhile the spectator remained hidden.\r\n\r\nBefore examining further Philip looked from these loop-holes, and to his\r\ndismay saw that he was already besieged.\r\n\r\nAt every point of vantage on the outside his enemies were posted. On the\r\nelevations of land in the immediate vicinity, the branches of the trees,\r\nand even the tops of the surrounding buildings, were groups of apes, who\r\nwatched this portion of the house as if understanding that in it was\r\nhidden the human animal from whom they expected such rare entertainment\r\nor revenge.\r\n\r\nThere could be no question but that they were on the _qui vive_, and at\r\nthe slightest movement of their captive would begin an attack. It was the\r\nsilent siege of an enemy who did not consider it necessary to conceal\r\nhimself behind his lines of defense.\r\n\r\nPhilip viewed the scene much as does a general when surveying a\r\nbattle-field. For the apes to climb up the sides of the house, whereon\r\nwere no projecting points, he knew was an impossibility, as it also was\r\nfor them to effect an entrance through the barricaded doors and windows.\r\nTo reach the tower from the adjoining buildings would not be difficult\r\nfor such agile climbers; but once there their opportunities for attack\r\nwould be no better than on the street below.\r\n\r\nThat Goliah was preparing for battle seemed hardly probable, since it is\r\nnot generally believed that animals know anything concerning warfare;\r\nbut yet he was certainly bringing up his troops in the most soldier-like\r\nfashion. From the loop-holes Philip could see company after company\r\nmarching to this point or that in regular order; and no less than twenty\r\nof the larger baboons, each wearing a saber by his side, were making\r\nregular rounds of the clearing, as if inspecting the troops.\r\n\r\nTo give it more the appearance of a regular siege, only certain of these\r\nlong-tailed warriors were on watch, the others remaining close at hand\r\nin readiness to open the battle at the first warning cry. These idle\r\nones were amusing themselves in a variety of ways. Some were wrestling,\r\nothers playing leap-frog, and not a few apparently interested in\r\nstory-telling—at least so it seemed to Philip in this latter case, for\r\nparties of from fifteen to twenty were gathered around some venerable\r\nmonkey who appeared to be talking very earnestly.\r\n\r\nNow and then Goliah would harangue the troops in the same manner as he\r\nhad addressed those composing the court-martial, and that he was making\r\ndirect reference to the house and its occupant could be told from the\r\nfact that he frequently pointed to those on guard as well as to the\r\nbuilding, finally going through a series of threatening gestures, as if\r\nexplaining what he proposed to do when the time for action should come.\r\n\r\nBut for Philip’s knowledge of how nearly apes can copy the movements\r\nof men he would have laughed at the baboons’ antics; but yet he could\r\nnot bring himself to believe his fortifications were in danger of being\r\ncarried, or that the enemy would make any real assault.\r\n\r\nIt seemed only reasonable to suppose the brutes would not continue very\r\nlong a siege which he could well sustain, according to the contents of\r\nhis larder, for many weeks; therefore, being tranquil in mind, he could\r\nafford to examine leisurely his place of refuge.\r\n\r\nA search resulted in his finding quite as much food for the mind as for\r\nthe body, which was a great boon, considering the length of time he\r\nmight be confined in this limited space. The apartment directly over the\r\nkitchen had been fitted up as a library and lounging-room, probably for\r\nthe benefit of Captain Seaworth’s officers, and here was a collection of\r\nbooks of travel.\r\n\r\nIn such an out-of-the-way corner of the world these silent companions\r\nwould be of the utmost value even in the case of those who enjoyed\r\nfreedom of action, but to Philip in his present condition they were rare\r\ntreasures.\r\n\r\nHis investigations in this quarter were ended for the time being, and\r\ndescending to the kitchen, he made such a breakfast of canned provisions\r\nas was in the highest degree satisfactory, washing it down with moderate\r\ndraughts of light wine. Then he betook himself once more to Captain\r\nSeaworth’s private office in the hope of finding something which would\r\ngive him a clew to the reasons why the island had thus been left to\r\nGoliah and his followers.\r\n\r\nA single written line indicating a combined attack of the apes would\r\nexplain why a large body of men had been overcome by the animals; yet,\r\narmed as the colonists undoubtedly were, able to shelter themselves\r\nbehind the walls of the buildings, it did not seem as if any number of\r\nthe monkey-tribe could vanquish such a force as he knew had made their\r\nheadquarters on this island.\r\n\r\nYet it appeared as if such must have been the case, and Philip searched\r\namong the papers in the hope of solving the riddle.\r\n\r\nThere were statements of moneys paid to the laborers, a detailed account\r\nof the erection of all the buildings, together with mention of the time\r\noccupied in unloading the vessel, dates as to when the crops had been\r\nplanted, memoranda to show what portion of the jungle was intended should\r\nbe cleared, and in fact all the minutiæ of the business connected with\r\nestablishing the colony, but no word relative to such enemies as Philip\r\nhad encountered.\r\n\r\nNot until he was about to abandon the search did he find that for which\r\nhe sought. A large book lying carelessly at one side of the room had\r\nhitherto escaped his observation because it seemed to be of little\r\nimportance, and he opened it without any idea that it might be the\r\ndocument for which he had been hunting so eagerly.\r\n\r\nThe first page was sufficient to arrest his attention, for on it was\r\nwritten, in bold letters, and in round, clear characters:\r\n\r\n_Log of the ship Reynard, and Journal of my stay at Luzon._\r\n\r\nHere was what Philip had been most anxious to find, and without thought\r\nof the grinning faces which were keeping close watch over the building\r\nhe seated himself in an arm-chair, believing the mystery was about to be\r\nsolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN SEAWORTH’S JOURNAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dry details of the log-book did not interest Philip save as they\r\nshowed him that the Reynard arrived at the island after a reasonably\r\nprosperous voyage, with the colonists and crew in the best of health.\r\n\r\nHe read of the exploration of the island, where mention was made of the\r\nextinct volcano which he had already seen, and learned that the village\r\nwas on the southernmost of the Toukang-Basi group.\r\n\r\nThen, in rapid succession, he noted the author’s remarks relative to\r\ncertain portions of the land which it was proposed to cultivate, ran his\r\neye carelessly over the meteorological observations, and passed quickly\r\non to those pages where mention was made of the settlement, referring to\r\nwhich Captain Sea worth wrote:\r\n\r\n    The portable houses prove to be a most admirable invention.\r\n    In fifteen days we have unloaded and set up every building,\r\n    and not one joist has been wrongly measured or marked. In that\r\n    short space of time we built an entire village resembling those\r\n    to be found in Sumatra, and are as comfortably situated as the\r\n    most captious colonist could desire.\r\n\r\n    The Reynard has been brought around to the eastern shore,\r\n    where we have found a small bay with water enough to float a\r\n    line-of-battle ship, and the banks of which are so densely\r\n    wooded that it is impossible to see a hundred yards in either\r\n    direction. But for the fact that we are in the very center of\r\n    a nest of Malay pirates, I should have no hesitation whatever\r\n    about leaving her at moorings in charge of the boatswain. As it\r\n    is, however, I am obliged to keep half the crew quartered on\r\n    board, which reduces my working force very materially.\r\n\r\n    If this colony does not succeed it will unquestionably be\r\n    because of the ever-increasing audacity of the pirates who\r\n    infest the seas in this part of the world. Their power\r\n    increases year by year, and their flotillas have become fleets.\r\n    The proas and junks are armed like frigates, and as sailors\r\n    and fighting-men their crews are the most energetic of any\r\n    nation; therefore it is that to guard against these marauders\r\n    is the most important of all our duties, and better the work\r\n    of planting should progress slowly than that we run the risk\r\n    of having the fruits of our labor destroyed through neglect of\r\n    precaution.\r\n\r\n    The soil of the island is evidently very fertile. Flowers\r\n    and fruits are abundant, and the thickest positively swarm\r\n    with game. Save for the apes, which are as thick here as\r\n    grasshoppers in a country field, this would be a garden spot\r\n    indeed. But the apes destroy the charm of the place, since one\r\n    must be constantly on watch against them, and they increase\r\n    like flies. Unless some means can be devised to exterminate\r\n    them we shall be forced to guard our plantations by night as\r\n    well as by day, and therefore I have many serious misgivings\r\n    as to whether the venture which has been so admirably planned\r\n    will prove successful. To defend ourselves against the pirates\r\n    from the ocean, and to save our crops from apes, we need at\r\n    least two hundred more men; and whether I shall be justified\r\n    in making the additional outlay, after it was decided that\r\n    there were to be no further expenditures, is the question which\r\n    disturbs me greatly.\r\n\r\n    To guard against these monkey-robbers, who pull up our plants\r\n    from sheer love of mischief, a high, barbed-wire fence would\r\n    answer every purpose; but, unfortunately, it would cost more\r\n    for such material than the additional force required, because\r\n    it must be sent out in a ship from New York. My first officer\r\n    counsels that we visit Lombok, Batavia, or Samarang, for the\r\n    purpose of procuring natives, and his opinion I should incline\r\n    to were it not for the fact that I am afraid to withdraw the\r\n    entire ship’s crew from the island lest the colonists be\r\n    overcome either by pirates or apes, the latter being quite as\r\n    formidable as the former.\r\n\r\nHere followed many notes regarding the labor already performed or\r\nprojected; and continuing after the banana plantation had been started,\r\nCaptain Seaworth wrote:\r\n\r\n    Our house life is charming. The colonists are enjoying the best\r\n    of health, in houses surrounded with palm-trees; and as for our\r\n    own quarters, I never had anything to compare with these, not\r\n    even in Madras, in point of comfort and elegance. We want for\r\n    nothing, and our amusements are numerous. Once each week we\r\n    give a ball in the drawing-room of the main building, and on\r\n    Saturday mornings we hold an informal court on the open lawn to\r\n    decide as to the business and government of our charming island.\r\n\r\n    Again I am constrained to speak of our pests, the apes. So\r\n    numerous are they, in fact, that one is almost certain, in\r\n    discharging a gun at hazard, to bring down an animal; and their\r\n    ferocity exceeds anything of which I have ever read. Those we\r\n    brought from the establishment of Garland & Co. are civilized\r\n    beings compared with the tribe we find here. It is a source of\r\n    many jokes that we should have taken the trouble to bring so\r\n    far pets which could be captured in such numbers. Instead of\r\n    buying apes, we could ship a full cargo and never know they had\r\n    left the island.\r\n\r\nAgain, the journal was continued with notes which would interest the\r\nstockholders of the enterprise more than they did Philip, and he passed\r\nhastily over them until he found the following:\r\n\r\n    I have been trying to teach the gigantic baboon, Goliah, to\r\n    follow me in the semi-weekly hunts we make for apes. Although\r\n    hundreds are killed on each occasion the numbers do not seem\r\n    to diminish, and we have decided to make hunters, if possible,\r\n    of the apes we brought with us. Goliah, especially, would be\r\n    invaluable could he be trained to prey upon those of his kind\r\n    who so disturb us. Thus far, however, we have met with only\r\n    partial success.\r\n\r\n    During our excursion yesterday, while in the center of a large\r\n    wood of mimosas, where I had wandered with the baboon, I\r\n    suddenly saw advancing toward me with a club, which he carried\r\n    like a drum-major’s cane, a gigantic mandrill, black as a\r\n    negro, and followed by a regiment of apes.\r\n\r\n    Goliah, generally so fierce and courageous, trembled with\r\n    terror as he beheld this enormous animal. He recognized in him\r\n    a conqueror, and consequently one to be feared. For the first\r\n    time since owning him he crouched by my side like a frightened\r\n    dog imploring protection, at the same time gnashing his teeth\r\n    and beating his breast as he glanced furtively toward the\r\n    gigantic beast who confronted him. This was the opportunity for\r\n    which I had sought. If my baboon would fight the mandrill and\r\n    come off victorious it might be possible the lesson had been\r\n    learned, and I raised my rifle with the intention of wounding\r\n    the brute, in order to make it more certain Goliah would\r\n    vanquish him.\r\n\r\n    Before I could discharge the weapon, however, the gigantic\r\n    stranger leaped upon Goliah regardless of my presence, and the\r\n    struggle between the two animals was terrific. Unquestionably\r\n    my baboon would speedily have been killed, for in a few seconds\r\n    he received most terrible punishment, and I was forced to fire\r\n    at the risk of hitting the wrong one. Fortunately my aim was\r\n    perfect, and the colossal mandrill fell dead.\r\n\r\n    Never have I seen any animal display so much joy as did\r\n    Goliah when his enemy expired. He would first shower blows\r\n    upon the body, and then fawn on me with the most extravagant\r\n    demonstrations of pleasure and thankfulness. With each buffet\r\n    of the carcass his courage seemed to return, and I flatter\r\n    myself that after a few more lessons he will understand his\r\n    mission is the slaughter of these long-tailed pests.\r\n\r\n    The apes who accompanied the mandrill dispersed immediately\r\n    after his fall without offering any violence, but from the\r\n    threatening demonstrations made to Goliah it seemed as if they\r\n    were vowing vengeance; and he must have understood something of\r\n    the kind, for despite his returning courage he hugged closer\r\n    to my side, trembling violently all the while. Could they have\r\n    gotten hold of him at that moment, the largest baboon ever\r\n    owned by Garland & Co. would soon have been food for the ants.\r\n\r\n    I shall have this enormous mandrill skinned, and dry his hide\r\n    and bones, in order to present them to the Museum at Central\r\n    Park on my return home.\r\n\r\n“Then this is the story of the skeleton I found hanging on the mimosas\r\nwhen I was first cast ashore here,” Philip said to himself. “He must\r\nhave hung it there that the ants might devour the flesh. But how much\r\ndifferent would have been my position had the captain or the mandrill\r\nkilled Goliah! I think I should most heartily enjoy seeing the bones of\r\nthat vicious baboon hanging side by side with those among the mimosas.”\r\n\r\nThis portion of the journal was concluded with two paragraphs, both of\r\nwhich were particularly interesting to Philip, and he read as follows:\r\n\r\n    From what I have heard of the habits of these peculiar animals,\r\n    coupled with my own observations, I am of the opinion that the\r\n    mandrill which I killed was the chief or leader of all the apes\r\n    on the island, and am greatly in hopes the death of this beast\r\n    may prevent many of their predatory excursions.\r\n\r\n    On returning from this hunt I placed my rifle in the concealed\r\n    armory, because I do not wish the baboons to get the idea that\r\n    I use anything but the weapons provided by nature, for it might\r\n    make them timid in the hunt which I am determined they shall\r\n    indulge in before many weeks more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nA HAPPY DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last paragraph which Philip read caused him to leap from his chair in\r\nvery excess of joy, since through it he learned that concealed somewhere\r\nin the building—probably very near where he sat—was a collection of\r\nweapons. If only so much as one rifle could be found, he would be\r\nreasonably certain of holding his besiegers at bay, at least until the\r\nprovisions were exhausted.\r\n\r\nHeeding not the volume, which had fallen to the floor, he made a hasty\r\ncircuit of the room, opening closet after closet until all but one had\r\nbeen examined, and in this last he found that for which he sought.\r\nCaptain Seaworth had referred to it as “the armory,” but it must have\r\nbeen his own private sporting weapons, for there were three fine\r\nfowling-pieces, two rifles, and a large quantity of cartridges made up\r\nfor every kind of game.\r\n\r\nTo buckle on one of the ammunition-belts, fill it with ball-cartridges\r\nand seize a rifle from the hooks was but the work of a moment, after\r\nwhich Philip felt that at last he was in a condition to cope with a\r\nhundred such as Goliah.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly possible to exterminate all the apes on the island from the\r\nwindows of the building, but he could certainly slay the most vicious,\r\nand having done so, would in a certain measure be free to move around.\r\n\r\nPhilip now understood that Goliah had taken the place of the mandrill\r\nwhom Captain Seaworth killed, and was exercising the rights of leader\r\nover them—an office which they probably respected because he approached\r\nso nearly in size to their late chief. With Goliah and his counselors\r\ndead, however, Philip’s position would be far more safe, if not\r\ncomfortable, and using the two chimpanzees as guard, it might be possible\r\nto roam about the island at will. Then he could gather yet more gold from\r\nthe subterranean stream, and stow it away preparatory to removal as soon\r\nas any vessel might visit that shore, unless, indeed, the pirates spoken\r\nof in the journal should first make their appearance.\r\n\r\nNow that he felt reasonably secure from the apes he began to fear those\r\nmarauders of the sea about whom he had read, and he could readily fancy\r\nthat to them was due the absence of the colonists. The pirates had\r\nmost likely made a raid upon the island, and killed or carried off as\r\nprisoners those who were trying to establish the plantation.\r\n\r\nAlthough this seemed the true and only reasonable explanation as to\r\nwhy Captain Seaworth and his party had disappeared, it was certainly\r\nstrange and beyond Philip’s power to imagine why a more thorough sack\r\nof the buildings had not taken place. That the pirates should leave all\r\nthis property—for so far as he had seen the houses were filled with a\r\nplentiful supply of movable goods—seemed incomprehensible; but he was\r\nnot disposed to waste much time in these useless speculations. It was as\r\nif he wished to enjoy the sense of security given by the weapons, and\r\nadvancing to the window he gazed through the loop-holes into the street.\r\n\r\nThe besiegers were still in the same places and the same attitudes of\r\nhostility, but they had increased in numbers. From this point of vantage\r\nhe counted among the foliage and crouching behind the trunks of the trees\r\nmore than a hundred animals, all watching the closed windows with the\r\ngreatest intentness, and evidently waiting for an opportunity to begin\r\nthe attack.\r\n\r\nPhilip laughed to himself as he saw the vindictive faces of the apes, and\r\nthought what a surprise he had in store for them, or how useless would be\r\ntheir attempts to drive him out. But he failed to realize what they could\r\ndo in case of an attack, or how fierce might be the battle. The knowledge\r\nthat he had plenty of ammunition caused him to look upon these brute\r\nenemies with a certain disdain which was destined to be changed to one of\r\nfear before many days passed.\r\n\r\nLeaving his position at the window he took the journal from the floor\r\nand laid it on the table, but without any intention of reading it. He\r\nwould have plenty of time in which to pursue the investigation, and was\r\nresolved now to enjoy himself after his own fashion. Besides, he was\r\nweary with sitting still so long, and hungry. A further perusal of the\r\ndocument which might reveal to him the cause of the colonists’ absence\r\ncould be had at any time, and there would undoubtedly be many dull hours\r\nto while away; consequently he was in no haste to finish the captain’s\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nA spiral staircase from the library led to the rooms below, and he went\r\ninto the kitchen intending there to have a hearty meal, for it would be\r\nfoolish not to enjoy that with which he was so generously provided.\r\n\r\nThere was an ample store of candles, and he lighted half a dozen in order\r\nto give the semblance of a feast to his lonely repast.\r\n\r\nSince his stay was indefinite and might be prolonged even into months,\r\nhe resolved to be methodical in his manner of living. Therefore, as the\r\nfirst step in this direction, he set about arranging the table with as\r\nmuch care as if he was to entertain a party of epicures.\r\n\r\nEven at this moment, when he fancied his wants were so generously\r\nprovided for, came the knowledge that he would be denied water. During\r\nhis previous repast he congratulated himself that there was plenty of\r\nwine, and thought this the most pleasant method of assuaging thirst;\r\nbut now he was of a different opinion. Although having been deprived of\r\nnature’s beverage so short a time, he would have bartered a case of the\r\nfinest champagne in Captain Seaworth’s collection for a single pint of\r\nsuch water as he had found in the grotto. But this it was impossible to\r\nobtain, and during the elaborate meal he fancied how refreshing would be\r\ncoffee or tea rather than the rare vintages with which he was plentifully\r\nsupplied.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of this meal he had an opportunity of taking account\r\nof the stores on hand, and, as nearly as could be judged, there was\r\nsufficient to last him at least three months; therefore fear of\r\nstarvation was not among his troubles.\r\n\r\nA hearty meal was conducive to sleep, and being thoroughly the master\r\nof his own time, Philip ascended the narrow staircase to the captain’s\r\nbed-chamber, where, for the first time since the gale which wrecked the\r\nSwallow sprung up, he was able to undress and retire in a Christian-like\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nThe unwonted luxury of a soft bed, clean sheets and pillows, were well\r\ncalculated to keep him within the borders of dreamland many hours, and\r\nwhen he awakened the morning sun was just peeping in through the crevices\r\nof the blind in the shutter.\r\n\r\nWith the awakening came the further and perhaps even greater desire for\r\nwater. He was denied even the pleasure of washing his face unless with\r\nwine, and contented himself as best he could by using a dry towel, after\r\nwhich he descended once more to the kitchen, where he made anything\r\nrather than a hearty meal of canned dainties. He was beginning to tire of\r\ndelicacies, and remembered with regret the coarse food from which he had\r\nturned with disgust while on board the Swallow.\r\n\r\nIt is strange in what a channel one’s fancies sometimes run. Here\r\nwas Philip, virtually a prisoner on an island inhabited by apes who\r\nwould rend him limb from limb should he venture out of doors, and yet\r\nhe was longing ardently for a commonplace plate of hash, and a cup of\r\nthe weakest coffee that was ever set before the patrons of a cheap\r\nboarding-house would have tasted at that moment like nectar. However,\r\nneither the hash nor the coffee was to be had for the wishing, and he\r\nascended once more to the library.\r\n\r\nAnother view of the surroundings was anything rather than reassuring.\r\nThe apes were there, with numbers still further increased, occupying the\r\nsame points of vantage as when he had seen them the day previous, and now\r\neach had in front of him, or in a crotch of a tree where he was located,\r\na little pile of heavy stones stacked up with as much care as if they had\r\nbeen cartridges, and Philip was soon to learn that they would be almost\r\nas effective as the heaviest charged shell in his collection.\r\n\r\nHis first thought on noting these missiles was that they were intended\r\nfor him as soon as he made his appearance out of doors. He failed\r\nto comprehend how the apes might use them; but all too soon did he\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he stood undetermined whether to give his assailants a taste\r\nof powder and ball at once, believing a lesson might be beneficial; but\r\nthe thought of the unfinished journal restrained him.\r\n\r\n“I have plenty of time in which to show what can be done with fire-arms,”\r\nhe said to himself, “and it won’t interfere with the effectiveness of\r\nthe dose if I wait until the hours begin to drag. Beside, it is to\r\nGoliah that the first instruction must be given, and then that little\r\nape who made me stand on my head shall be the next to receive one of the\r\ncaptain’s bullets.”\r\n\r\nThus it was that a desire for revenge had come into Philip’s mind with\r\nthe first assurance of his own safety, as it often comes to the minds of\r\nothers. We arrogate to ourselves the right to teach, and cloak under it\r\na vengeance oftentimes as childish as the besieged animal-trainer’s may\r\nseem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nSOLVING THE MYSTERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the happy belief in his mind that he could punish and drive away his\r\nassailants whenever he should feel so disposed, Philip seated himself\r\nonce more in the captain’s arm-chair and opened the journal at the page\r\nwhereon he had found the welcome information concerning the weapons.\r\n\r\nIt was no longer like a person who believes himself in danger that Philip\r\ncontinued the story. The fire-arms and stock of ammunition had given him\r\na sense of almost perfect security, and to have seen him as he took up\r\nthe book one would have supposed him to be some prosperous planter’s son\r\nrather than a shipwrecked youth surrounded on all sides by brute enemies.\r\n\r\nPhilip had ceased reading at the point where the mystery attending the\r\ndisappearance of the colonists was apparently solved, and now the lines\r\nwhich followed caused him to be oblivious of everything around. The\r\nadditional information was couched in the following words:\r\n\r\n    We have this morning discovered that which gives my officers\r\n    and myself the greatest uneasiness. There can no longer be any\r\n    question but that the pirates have learned of our whereabouts,\r\n    and are already meditating an attack, in which case we shall\r\n    be almost entirely at their mercy, for the ship is not armed\r\n    sufficiently heavy to resist such an onslaught as may be\r\n    expected.\r\n\r\n    It has been the subject of consultation during the forenoon,\r\n    and opinion seems to be equally divided as to whether we ought\r\n    to abandon the plantation, or destroy the ship and hold out\r\n    as long as possible in such frail refuge as the buildings of\r\n    the village will afford. In the event of our deciding upon\r\n    this last plan, it is an open question with me whether we will\r\n    not be sacrificing more than if we left the island until a\r\n    sufficient force of natives can be procured from one of the\r\n    Dutch settlements to augment our army until we are able to cope\r\n    with these scourges of the seas.\r\n\r\n    The cause of our uneasiness may seem a trifling one to the\r\n    uninitiated, but those who are at all familiar with the customs\r\n    of the Malays can readily understand how imminent is the danger\r\n    which threatens.\r\n\r\n    Last evening Mr. Clark, who is in command of the ship while\r\n    she lays at anchorage, believed he saw the reflection of a\r\n    light from the southernmost point of the island, but owing to\r\n    the lateness of the hour he did not report such fact to me.\r\n    This morning at daybreak he, with half a dozen of the crew,\r\n    proceeded to that portion of the beach where the fire was\r\n    supposed to have been built, and the absence of any embers in\r\n    the vicinity convinced him that he had been mistaken or else\r\n    a vessel was burned many miles off the coast. On returning\r\n    to the Reynard, however, he found sufficient proof that the\r\n    pirates had been on shore within the past twenty-four hours,\r\n    for sticking in the sand directly opposite the ship was a\r\n    Malay creese. It is such a menace as cannot be misunderstood.\r\n    Before making an attack the pirates, in case members of their\r\n    own tribe are at a station to be destroyed, leave such a weapon\r\n    near by as token that they must be ready to use their own\r\n    creeses when the battle begins. We have among the colonists\r\n    four Malays, whom we took from Batavia as interpreters in the\r\n    event of our finding any natives on this island.\r\n\r\n    I am positive these four did not see the sinister message,\r\n    otherwise the knife would have been removed; and I have just\r\n    given Mr. Clark orders to forbid the sailors to leave the ship\r\n    lest the fact should become known to those who may have joined\r\n    us simply for the purpose of aiding in the massacre which would\r\n    probably take place if the pirates landed. Judging from what I\r\n    have read and heard, it is not likely we shall be molested for\r\n    several days; therefore sufficient time yet remains in which to\r\n    decide upon our course of action.\r\n\r\n    At this moment the arrival of a ship would be most opportune.\r\n    I am positive any captain could be persuaded or hired to\r\n    remain at anchor here three or four weeks, while a portion of\r\n    our company sailed in search of natives. In any event, word\r\n    could be sent to Batavia; therefore, in the hope of signaling\r\n    a vessel that shall lend such assistance, I have had a fire\r\n    built in the crater of the old volcano, which is the highest\r\n    point of land, and detailed a force of men to feed it night and\r\n    day. Should any European craft pass within sight, her commander\r\n    would unquestionably endeavor to learn the reason for the\r\n    beacon, and thus my object may be attained.\r\n\r\n“I am gradually learning the cause of the apes’ movements,” Philip said\r\nto himself, as he looked up from the book thoughtfully. “Goliah’s force\r\nprobably enjoyed the glare of the flames, and since then, when having\r\nnothing better to occupy their attention, have kept the fire alive as I\r\nsaw it on the night they captured me. If I ever succeed in reaching home\r\nagain I shall have a true story to tell which will seem in the highest\r\ndegree improbable.”\r\n\r\nThen he turned his attention to the journal once more, and read the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n    During the past week the officers have been making ready for\r\n    a ball to be held in this building, and I do not consider it\r\n    necessary to put an end to the festivities. This merry-making\r\n    will serve to allay any suspicions regarding our safety which\r\n    may have sprung up among the colonists, owing to our protracted\r\n    consultation of the morning, and it is in the highest degree\r\n    essential that no panic shall ensue, whatever plan we may\r\n    decide upon. The officers are warned to keep our deliberations\r\n    a secret, and the people will dance and sing as if we were in\r\n    perfect security, instead of living, as is really the case, on\r\n    the crater of a sleeping volcano, which has already begun to\r\n    seethe and boil preparatory to an eruption.\r\n\r\nThis last paragraph completed the page, and Philip eagerly turned to the\r\nnext leaf, but it was blank. The journal, which he had believed would\r\nextend very much further, was suddenly ended. Not a word respecting the\r\nball, nor any mention of the weapon left in the sand!\r\n\r\nA sinister blank followed the last line penned by the captain. What had\r\nhappened to the colony and to the writer himself since this final entry?\r\nNo one was present to answer these questions; but an ominous reply was\r\nwritten everywhere around in the silence and desolation; the houses\r\npartially destroyed and their contents pillaged; savage and vindictive\r\nanimals wearing, as if in raillery, the habiliments of gallant officers.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of that day Philip sat in the library studying\r\nover what was apparently a solution of the mystery, but arriving at\r\nno satisfactory conclusion. It seemed almost certain the pirates had\r\ninterrupted the merry-making, and that the captain was massacred before\r\nthe dawning of another morning, otherwise he would have written more, for\r\nthe journal bore evidence of an entry, however slight or insignificant,\r\neach day.\r\n\r\n“But,” Philip asked himself, “if the Malays did make the descent, why\r\nwas not the village destroyed, and why were the valuable contents of\r\nthe houses left behind? If the pirates overcame the colonists they\r\nwould have had plenty of opportunity to sack and pillage, for there\r\nwas no possibility of an interruption, since they were masters of the\r\nsurrounding sea.”\r\n\r\nOne other supposition flashed across Philips mind, although it seemed\r\ntoo absurd to be seriously entertained, and this was that the apes had\r\nforestalled the murderous intentions of the pirates. Despite the apparent\r\nfoolishness of such a conjecture Philip could not banish the idea, even\r\nthough he said many times that if all belonging to the colony had been\r\nassassinated in some mysterious way, he would certainly have found their\r\nremains during his travels since the shipwreck.\r\n\r\nNight came and he was still seated in the library sad and disheartened.\r\nDuring the hours of darkness he alternately slumbered and speculated\r\nupon the tragedy which must have taken place. Before morning he solved\r\nthe mystery or believed he did; and, terrible as was his theory, it had\r\nstrangely ’ enough the effect of calming him to a wonderful degree.\r\n\r\n“It can only be accounted for by the fact that the creese had been\r\nleft on the shore earlier than the officer of the ship believed,” he\r\nsaid aloud, as if addressing a companion. “The light which Mr. Clark\r\nthinks he fancied must have been a reality—a signal to other vessels in\r\nthe vicinity. While the ball was at its height the pirates landed, so\r\ncompletely surprising the merry-makers that resistance was more than\r\nuseless; therefore no blood was shed, but every member of the party was\r\nmade prisoner. At that moment, according to my belief, a body of apes\r\nappeared, and the pirates, in the darkness, mistaking them for human\r\nbeings, fled before there was an opportunity to gather up the plunder.”\r\n\r\nThis supposition was certainly the most plausible of any yet entertained\r\nby Philip. Had the entire colony been captured while at the ball, it\r\nwould account for the disorder of the dining-room, where the tables had\r\nbeen prepared for the banquet.\r\n\r\nWith these gloomy ideas in his mind Philip no longer dreamed of\r\nvengeance. He now believed that escape from the island was impossible.\r\nShould he succeed in holding the apes at bay it would only serve to\r\nprolong life until the pirates returned, as they undoubtedly would under\r\nthe belief that there were more inhabitants on the island.\r\n\r\n“I shall live in this building as in a tomb as long as it pleases God to\r\npreserve me,” he said to himself. “And the treasure in the cave is of no\r\nmore value than if I had piled up the sands on the sea-shore. To dream of\r\nleaving here is little less than madness, surrounded and guarded as I am\r\nby those who are a thousand times more crafty and cruel than the Malay\r\npirates.”\r\n\r\nAll hope was dead, and as does one who bids farewell to this earth,\r\nexpecting his stay on it is numbered by hours, he moved about\r\nmechanically, but yet instinctively trying to preserve longer his\r\nwretched existence. As if his weapons were now useless he replaced them\r\nin the closet, but examined once more the fastenings of the doors and\r\nwindows, closing the shuttered loop-holes that he might not see the\r\nsinister and menacing cordon of besiegers.\r\n\r\nThen he descended to the floor below, determined there to spend the last\r\nfew hours of this most unnatural drama. The darkness was preferable to\r\nlight when even the slight consolation of hope must be denied, and he\r\nwaited only for death, in what form he did not speculate, to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF HOSTILITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to describe the condition of mind into which Philip fell\r\nwhen the hope which had so long sustained him took flight.\r\n\r\nAs one in a dream, and hardly more conscious of his movements than a\r\nsleeper, he remained during the next five days in the lower story of the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nA most unnatural and unhealthy condition of mind it was; but another\r\nunder the same circumstances might have displayed even less fortitude.\r\nHe believed death to be inevitable in a very short time, and that it\r\nwas an equal chance whether the blow would be dealt by pirates or apes;\r\ntherefore, with his sensibilities dulled by the conviction that his days\r\non earth were few, he passed them as does the brute, and without thought\r\nsave for the one supreme moment.\r\n\r\nMechanically he ate, drank and slept, seeing nothing save those objects\r\nwhich were revealed by the rays of the candles, and it is more than\r\nprobable his mind would have given way under the continued monotony had\r\nit not been for the rebellion his body made against this unnatural mode\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nHis clothes, which had been literally torn to rags during his painful\r\nexperience in trying to amuse the apes and his subsequent flight through\r\nthe thicket, actually fell from his body, and since he possessed neither\r\nneedle nor thread he was almost in a complete state of nudity.\r\n\r\nThe rainy season, which answers in the tropics to our winter, had just\r\ncommenced. The nights were damp, even cold; and it was against this\r\nexposure that his body rebelled. During the first two or three days the\r\ndeprivation of natural beverage affected him but slightly. He drank\r\nfrequently of the different wines and liquors to be found in the closet,\r\nand therefore was always thirsty. The greater amount of spirits he\r\nconsumed the more necessary did water become, and as his body protested\r\nagainst the cold, so did his stomach and brain cry out against such\r\nstimulants.\r\n\r\nThat which at the end of the second day had simply been an inconvenience\r\nbecame absolute suffering as time wore on. His eyes were swollen and\r\nbloodshot; his pulse beat with feverish rapidity, his mouth felt parched\r\nand dry, and the throbbing of his brain was like violent blows against\r\nthe skull. It needed but little to deprive him of reason, and yet he\r\nrealized not his own condition.\r\n\r\nIt was while suffering from that which was so nearly akin to delirium\r\nthat, hardly knowing what he did he ascended the staircase, took once\r\nmore the weapons from the closet and approached the window.\r\n\r\nThe fever in his blood rendered him irresponsible, and now a conflict was\r\nsomething to be desired. In his mind came a vague idea that he would end\r\nit all and die fighting. Better such an end than to yield up his life\r\namid the loneliness of that dwelling.\r\n\r\nPiling all the ammunition under the window which was situated directly\r\nbeneath the tower, and loading every musket and rifle, a savage glee took\r\npossession of him as he opened the loop-hole.\r\n\r\nThat which met his gaze temporarily sobered him. The fumes of the liquor\r\nwere driven from his brain, and he saw clearly the danger which menaced.\r\n\r\nOn the day when he descended to the kitchen with the intention of\r\nremaining until death should come to his release there had been perhaps\r\ntwo hundred apes guarding the dwelling. As he looked forth now, five\r\ntimes as many were to be seen. To count them was impossible; they were as\r\nthe sands of the sea, and equally silent.\r\n\r\nFive days previous these besiegers had gathered only insignificant piles\r\nof stones. Now this rude ammunition had increased to such an enormous\r\nextent that it formed veritable hills, placed so close one to the other\r\nthat it was as if an army had been throwing up breastworks, and behind\r\nthem three men each raised on the shoulders of the other could hardly\r\nhave looked over the top. The dwelling, instead of commanding a view of\r\nthe surrounding country, was now so inclosed that he was forced to lift\r\nhis eyes in order to see the grinning faces which were gazing down upon\r\nhim. The house no longer stood on an elevation, but in a valley formed by\r\nthese walls of projectiles.\r\n\r\nJust within the edge of the woods, where was yet an open space, two large\r\napes were engaged in a deadly struggle, and Philip watched them for a\r\nmoment with a sort of savage pleasure, as if delighting in the brutal\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nThen a delirium of fever seized him once more. He was no longer a\r\nreasoning animal, but a brute sunk to the level of those who held him\r\ncaptive.\r\n\r\nWithout questioning as to what might be gained by such a course, he\r\ndischarged both barrels of his musket into the crowd of those who had\r\ngathered around the combatants, and three fell at the first discharge.\r\nAgain and again he emptied his weapons, mowing down long lines of apes,\r\nbut apparently increasing their numbers, for as one fell a dozen sprung\r\nto fill his place in the line of battle which was now formed.\r\n\r\nIn five minutes, where perhaps a hundred had stood, half a thousand were\r\ngathered.\r\n\r\nNeither were these new-comers idle. It was as if the report of his weapon\r\nhad been waited for as the signal of a general assault, and in an instant\r\nthe air was filled with fragments of rocks and stones, until one might\r\nhave fancied a furious hailstorm was raging. Pelting against the building\r\non all sides came the missiles, doing little damage at first; but it was\r\nnot possible such a frail structure could long withstand the assault.\r\n\r\nAmid the shower of stones were handfuls of sand, as if the latter was\r\nthrown by weaker arms; and, accompanied by grunts and shrieks of the\r\nbesiegers, the effect can hardly be described. It was deafening, and at\r\nthe same time horrible.\r\n\r\nMaddened by continued drinking of liquor, and also by the terrific din\r\nwithout, Philip kept up a perfect fusillade, until the moment came when\r\nhis weapons were so choked and heated that it was necessary to pause.\r\n\r\nNot for an instant did the apes cease their attack, however. It was as\r\nif this silence on the part of the besieged gave them renewed courage,\r\nand the splintering of wood from time to time told that some timber had\r\nyielded to their repeated assaults.\r\n\r\nOne would have said that these animals were well skilled in the art of\r\nwar. They advanced by platoons, discharging a volley and falling back to\r\nget more supplies, while fresh troops advanced.\r\n\r\nMuch as a skillful general might do when his enemy shows signs of\r\nweakening, Goliah appeared on the scene at the moment Philip’s fusillade\r\nceased, and, urging his followers to greater exertions, flung a heavy,\r\njagged fragment of rock at the window with such force that the shutter\r\nwas splintered, the pieces which fell inside knocking Philip to the floor.\r\n\r\nThis was the first evidence of what might be accomplished by such a\r\nbombardment, and through this rent in the wall came showers of stones,\r\nuntil the room was partially filled.\r\n\r\nPhilip was dazed for the moment by the fragments of wood; but he sprung\r\nto his feet on regaining consciousness, and once more opened fire, this\r\ntime from another window. Such a fearful storm of projectiles rained\r\ninto the room that he would have been killed before one cartridge was\r\nexploded had he attempted to fire through the breach.\r\n\r\nHe no longer heeded the condition of his weapons. One musket was used\r\nuntil the danger of explosion was so imminent as to make it apparent to\r\nhis disordered mind, and dropping the useless gun he seized another,\r\nfiring with accurate aim, but never diminishing in the slightest the\r\nenemy’s vigor.\r\n\r\nThe second shutter gave way before the fierce assault. He was wounded by\r\nthe splinters of wood and fragments of stone. His face was lacerated and\r\nseveral teeth were broken. His hands were bleeding, and the upper portion\r\nof his body was bruised and swollen.\r\n\r\nThe ammunition was becoming exhausted, and he saw with dismay that not\r\nonly was it impossible to vanquish the enemy unaided, but also that he\r\ncould not continue the battle a great many hours longer.\r\n\r\nHundreds of cartridges had been used; the shells were strewn so thickly\r\nabout him that he was forced now and then to stop and kick them away in\r\norder to gain a foot-hold.\r\n\r\nBefore nightfall two of the muskets had burst in his hands, fortunately\r\nwithout inflicting any serious injury, and he understood that it was\r\nnecessary to cease hostilities on his side until the remainder of the\r\nweapons could be cleaned.\r\n\r\nIt was when he arrived at this decision that the shades of night began to\r\nfall, and never before, to man, did the going down of the sun give more\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nDarkness settled over the island. The apes ceased their bombardment, and\r\nvictory was for the time undecided.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, however, the apes were really the conquerors, since\r\nthe enemy whose ranks can be continually reinforced must triumph in the\r\nend were he a hundred times less clever and brave than his adversary;\r\ntherefore it is that in battle “might makes right.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nA METAMORPHOSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil this night Philip had fancied that the dwelling would serve him as\r\nan impregnable fort; but the result of the first day’s battle showed how\r\nidle was such belief. It was hardly probable the building would withstand\r\nanother attack, and he who had flattered himself that he was safe as long\r\nas he remained indoors understood how shelterless he would be after four\r\nor five hours more of stone-throwing.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of such imminent danger had a beneficial effect upon the\r\nsolitary occupant of Captain Seaworth’s house. It cleared the fumes of\r\nliquor from his brain, as it were, and left him weaker in body, but\r\nmentally better able to comprehend his exact position.\r\n\r\nCarrying his weapons, he descended to the kitchen once more, and there\r\nthe excitement brought on a fever turn, with which came also despair.\r\nHe was like one in an ague-fit, and after the heat of the melee had\r\nsubsided—which was not until he had partially cleaned his weapons with\r\nwine instead of water—a cold chill took possession of him.\r\n\r\nNow a covering of some sort became necessary. It seemed as if he was\r\nliterally freezing to death, and with a lighted candle in his hand he\r\nrushed frantically upstairs, hoping to find draperies with which to\r\nscreen his almost naked body, or failing in that, intending to use the\r\nlight covering of the bed.\r\n\r\nAmmunition had become as essential to success as clothing, and again he\r\nsearched feverishly around the room.\r\n\r\nIt was while overhauling one of Captain Seaworth’s chests that Philip\r\nplaced his hands on a thick fur which felt soft as silk.\r\n\r\nDelighted at the discovery he examined it closely, and found that it was\r\nthe entire hide of an animal similar to those by whom he was besieged.\r\nFrom its enormous size he became convinced it was the coat of the\r\ngigantic mandrill killed by the captain—the same brute whose skeleton,\r\nhanging in the mimosas, had caused him so much surprise as well as fear.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a slit in the stomach the hide had been taken off\r\nentire, and, shrunken somewhat during the process of drying, it fitted\r\nPhilip as well as if it were made by an expert furrier.\r\n\r\nThrough the opening in the front he inserted his body, as does a boy who\r\nputs on one of those peculiar night-gowns made to cover each limb; and\r\nin order that none of the warmth so necessary just then should escape,\r\nhe laced up the aperture with a piece of string. Pulling the top of the\r\nhide over his head, he had cap, coat and trousers of the same material,\r\nall fitting like a glove, and warm enough to withstand the rigors of an\r\nArctic winter.\r\n\r\nWhen his toilet was completed he looked at himself in the glass, but\r\nimmediately drew back with a cry of alarm.\r\n\r\nHis brown skin, thin cheeks and parched lips, which allowed his teeth to\r\nbe seen, his prominent cheek-bones, disheveled hair, together with eyes\r\nhollow and restless, because of the fever, caused him to look exactly\r\nlike the ape whose garment he was wearing.\r\n\r\nIt would hardly be possible to imagine a more striking resemblance, and\r\nPhilip himself was decidedly troubled. It seemed as if he had descended,\r\nboth in body and mind, to the level of his enemies.\r\n\r\nThere was warmth in this garment, however, and with it came a return of\r\nthe fever. At all events, it is better to say his subsequent movements\r\nwere caused by the fire in his blood than to fancy for a single moment\r\nthat the skin of the animal had such an effect as to make him leap over\r\nthe chairs or tables in the same fashion as its original owner might have\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nHe was transformed into an ape in appearance, and one could fancy this\r\nhad unsettled his mind, for many moments elapsed before he resumed the\r\nbearing of a human being.\r\n\r\nThen he descended to the kitchen, spread for himself a repast composed of\r\ndelicacies which had become distasteful, and forced himself to eat until\r\nthe generous food caused the fever to subside somewhat.\r\n\r\nThe sight of his fur-covered arms almost frightened him, and not for all\r\nthe treasure in the subterranean chambers would he have taken another\r\nglance at the glass, lest his own identity be forgotten in the belief\r\nthat he had become one of that species in whose education he formerly\r\nfelt so much interest.\r\n\r\nHis mind was a curious mixture of fancies and realities, all so strangely\r\ninterwoven that it seemed more like some hideous nightmare than the\r\nevents of life.\r\n\r\nNot until nearly daybreak did he fall into an uneasy slumber, which\r\nbrought with it representations of every specimen of the monkey-tribe,\r\nand on awakening shortly after sunrise he felt as weary as if sleep had\r\nlong been a stranger to his eyelids.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary he should be at his post of duty when the battle was\r\nopened once more, as it undoubtedly soon would be, and with his weapons\r\nin but little better condition than on the previous day he went into the\r\nroom above, stationing himself at the corner window opposite the one\r\nwhich had been demolished.\r\n\r\nThis time it was the besiegers, not the besieged, who began the attack.\r\nPhilip had hardly opened the loop-hole when showers of stones fell,\r\nand before he had time even to discharge a weapon a large portion of\r\nthe front wall and roof collapsed under the weight of missiles, thus\r\ncontracting his place of refuge to less than half its original size.\r\n\r\nRealizing that he must check, if possible, this furious attack, lest the\r\nbuilding be utterly demolished and he crushed to death amid the ruins,\r\nPhilip began to fire with the utmost rapidity. During the next hour\r\nhe sent shot after shot at intervals of not more than ten or fifteen\r\nseconds, but with no better result than before. It is true he could see\r\nan ape fall at every discharge, but his enemies were so numerous that\r\nthe gaps were immediately closed with soldierly precision, and when\r\nfifty rounds had been fired it seemed as if the numbers of the besiegers\r\nincreased rather than diminished.\r\n\r\nNow and then a crash could be heard, telling that some portion of the\r\nbuilding had fallen, and it seemed hardly probable he would be able to\r\ncontinue the struggle an hour longer.\r\n\r\nEven though he might succeed in so far husbanding his strength as to\r\nkeep up the firing indefinitely, his weapons would soon cease to be of\r\nservice. Already was he reduced to one musket, the barrel of which was\r\nso hot as to burn his hands, and it was only a question of a few moments\r\nbefore he would be defenceless.\r\n\r\nHe could see Goliah leaping from point to point as he urged his followers\r\nto greater exertions, and never once remaining in one position long\r\nenough to serve as a fair target.\r\n\r\nThe rocks fell like rain in a summer shower, and at the expiration of\r\na quarter of an hour the last remaining musket was so choked as to be\r\nuseless. The entire front of the house gave way. The floor of the chamber\r\nswayed to and fro like the branches of a tree in a storm, and it was\r\nonly by clutching at the window-casings that he saved himself from being\r\nprecipitated into the road.\r\n\r\nHe could feel the building crumbling beneath his feet, and it now\r\nremained for him to accept one of the two alternatives. He must stay\r\nwhere he was, knowing he would soon be crushed under the fragments of the\r\ndwelling, or leap into the midst of the savage brutes who were maddened\r\nby thought of victory, and there die like a man.\r\n\r\nOn a shelf near by was a dagger, perhaps the very weapon the Malays had\r\nleft sticking in the sand, and beside it lay his revolver, which he had\r\ndiscarded when the battle first began, believing it too small to be of\r\nany real service.\r\n\r\nThese two he seized, one in each hand, and mentally nerving himself for\r\nthe death which he fancied must come immediately, he leaped through the\r\nrent in the walls, alighting on his feet in the road half a dozen paces\r\nfrom the vindictive Goliah.\r\n\r\nIn his mind there was not the slightest thought that it would be possible\r\nto escape a painful death. His only idea was to die while fighting,\r\nrather than submit to capture and such torture as the apes could probably\r\ndevise.\r\n\r\nTherefore it is not to be wondered at that an astonishment amounting\r\nalmost to bewilderment seized upon him when the army, instead of making\r\na deadly assault, dropped their weapons, drew back with every show of\r\nrespect and even terror, and then bent before him as if trying to assume\r\nthe most humble positions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The front of the house gave way under the shower of stones\r\nthrown at Philip by the monkeys.—(See page 191.)]\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the troop, who a few moments previous had been so eager\r\nto encompass his death, now literally cringed before Philip like whipped\r\ncurs, and with Goliah at their head gathered around, fawning and\r\ncaressing, while Philip stood as if stupefied; and in fact only that word\r\nwould explain his mental condition.\r\n\r\nThe entire army crouched around him, some licking his hands, others his\r\nfeet, and all showing in every possible way delight and abasement. Not a\r\ngesture of anger was made, and every head was bowed in evident respect.\r\n\r\nIt was fully a quarter of an hour before the bewildered Philip had so\r\nfar gained the mastery over himself as to form the slightest conjecture\r\nof the reason for this sudden change in the behavior of his enemies,\r\nand then like a flash of light came into his mind the thought that in\r\nthe mandrill’s skin he was mistaken for the gigantic ape whom Captain\r\nSeaworth had suspected was the leader of all the apes on the island.\r\n\r\nFrom the bearing of those who had so lately bent every energy to kill him\r\nthere could be no doubt but that he was safe, and his salvation was due\r\nonly to the fact that in him the army recognized an ape, or rather the\r\nking of apes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW KING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Philip stood silent and motionless, trying to realize all that the\r\nposition of a leader of apes might signify, and speculating as to whether\r\nit would be possible for him to carry out the part designated by his\r\nbrute companions, the animals were literally walking over each other in\r\ntheir efforts to show allegiance or to give proof of joy at his return.\r\n\r\nPhilip’s first official act was to study closely the countenances of\r\nthose nearest, to discover if they were perplexed or suspicious because\r\nhe did not answer their chattering.\r\n\r\nThe owner of Philip’s skin must have been a quiet sort of fellow and one\r\nwho was not given to conversation, for his delighted subjects appeared to\r\nthink there was nothing strange in this silence of their king after so\r\nlong an absence.\r\n\r\nGoliah appeared to be the only member of the party who was not delighted\r\nat the sudden turn which affairs had taken; and this was but natural,\r\nsince it could hardly be expected that a despot will “step down and\r\nout” from his high position without showing some signs of sorrow at\r\nrelinquishing his authority. He accepted the inevitable with remarkably\r\ngood grace, however, even going so far as to seem pleased at seeing the\r\nrightful king come to his own once more.\r\n\r\nThis was the source of no slight relief to Philip. Had the big baboon\r\nattempted to incite a rebellion, it is barely possible that he who had so\r\nsuddenly discovered himself a monarch would be deposed, for with treason\r\nin the camp he would be at the mercy of the conspirators, since, not\r\nunderstanding the language of the realm, he could not employ spies, and\r\nhis downfall might be even more sudden than his elevation.\r\n\r\nBut, as has been said, Goliah bore with wonderful equanimity the loss\r\nof his crown, and at once installed himself in the office of adviser or\r\nmember of the privy council, which position one of the slain had probably\r\nheld prior to the king’s sudden disappearance.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that not only his high dignities but his life depended upon\r\nthe naturalness with which he wore the borrowed skin, Philip endeavored\r\nto ape the apes, exerting himself to leap about in the most fantastic\r\nmanner, as he had seen Goliah do during his reign, and, singular as it\r\nmay seem, his antics were greeted with the most vociferous applause.\r\n\r\nThe only difficulty he experienced in transforming himself into a brute\r\nwas his inability to wave the tail back and forth, expressive of pleasure\r\nor disapprobation, and his first edict was promulgated privately for\r\nhis own benefit, to the effect that he must never turn his back upon his\r\ncourtiers.\r\n\r\nIt was fully two hours before the delighted throng had finished showing\r\ntheir pleasure at the monarch’s return, and then the crowd gave way\r\nsufficiently for him to set out, accompanied by the courtiers and a long\r\ntrain of attendants, to make a general inspection of the one town in his\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nIn the hour of his prosperity—if one can be called prosperous who has\r\nsuddenly been transformed into an ape—Philip did not forget the debt of\r\ngratitude he owed the chimpanzee, but immediately directed his steps\r\ntoward the rear of the buildings, where the unfortunate Ben Bolt still\r\nlanguished behind prison-bars.\r\n\r\nAs the vast assembly arrived in front of the iron cage on the floor of\r\nwhich lay the poor captive whose only crime consisted in having incurred\r\nthe displeasure of the vicious Goliah, Alice, who was trying to console\r\nthe unfortunate chimpanzee as best she could from the outside, darted\r\nback in affright, believing the time had come when her mate was to be\r\nsacrificed to the vengeance of the baboon.\r\n\r\nEven she did not recognize the animal-trainer in his new character; but\r\nshe evidently had kindly remembrances of him who formerly owned Philip’s\r\nskin, for instead of continuing her flight she halted at the edge of the\r\nthicket until a gesture from the new king brought her to the bars of the\r\ncage once more.\r\n\r\nPhilip lost no time in unfastening the bolts, and, reassuring the\r\ncaptive as best he could by dumb show, led him forth to where Alice\r\nstood, awaiting in painful uncertainty the result of this sudden change\r\nof affairs.\r\n\r\nGoliah understood even before the chimpanzee did that they were free to\r\ngo wheresoever they pleased, and he gave, vent to low cries of rage and\r\ndespair as he saw the two walk away paw in paw, the happiest-looking\r\nmonkeys in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nEven then the deposed ruler did not show the least sign of\r\ninsubordination; he accepted what was to him the inevitable with becoming\r\nresignation, save for the hoarse cries he uttered.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at that after this simple act of justice had\r\nbeen done, Philip was wholly at a loss to know how to comport himself in\r\naccordance with his dignity. To move even the short distance of a yard\r\nwithout his numerous train of followers was impossible. His life had been\r\nspared only at the expense of becoming thoroughly an ape, and it was\r\nnecessary to play well the part assigned him, until such time as friendly\r\nmembers of his own race should land upon the island.\r\n\r\nThe thought that Captain Seaworth might succeed in regaining his liberty\r\nand return with the colonists was the only thing that sustained him\r\nin this trying position. With hands clasped behind his back in a very\r\nun-apish attitude, he walked slowly toward his late place of refuge,\r\nfollowed by thousands of his monkey-subjects, all moving as if plunged in\r\nthe deepest reflection.\r\n\r\nArriving at the ruins of the building he seated himself upon the\r\nfragments of some timber, trying to decide what his future course of\r\naction should be, and the crowd gathered silently around with the utmost\r\nshow of respect.\r\n\r\nWhile sitting here it was but natural that Philip’s thoughts should\r\nrevert to the battle so lately and singularly ended, and he looked about\r\nhim for the bodies of the slain.\r\n\r\nSurely hundreds had fallen under his well-directed and continuous fire,\r\nbut yet not a single corpse was to be seen. Search with his eyes where he\r\nwould, it was as if the besiegers had suffered no loss whatever; and the\r\nreason for such a state of affairs he was not long in divining.\r\n\r\nThe apes had buried their comrades!\r\n\r\nThis newly-acquired knowledge led up to a subject which troubled Philip\r\nseriously. If any of his devoted followers should chance to discover the\r\nskeleton hanging in the mimosas, would they not recognize it as the frame\r\nof their former king, and thus be in a position to brand the present\r\nmonarch as an impostor? Inasmuch as all their dead were consigned to the\r\nearth, it would be known at once that this ape had been killed before\r\nthe appearance of the shipwrecked youth on the island. He already had\r\nsufficient proof of their reasoning powers to believe they would readily\r\ndivine the meaning of the sinister mimosa fruit, more especially since it\r\nundoubtedly hung in the same thicket where they saw their king fall.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to put an end to this possible embarrassment at the very\r\nbeginning of his reign; but how could it be done? One may think it would\r\nbe a simple matter to bury the bones near where they were now hanging.\r\nSuch a plan could indeed have been carried into execution with the\r\ngreatest facility when Philip was the shipwrecked animal-trainer; but now\r\nthat he had become king of the island, and was surrounded by hundreds of\r\nfollowers, it was an extremely difficult project, since upon the secrecy\r\nof the movement depended its success.\r\n\r\n“At all events,” Philip said to himself, “it is useless for me to think\r\nof stealing away unobserved just now. I must await an opportunity, and\r\ntrust to the chapter of accidents that my predecessor’s bones may not be\r\ndiscovered meanwhile.”\r\n\r\nAs he thus put from his mind this unpleasant contingency, the desire for\r\nwater, which had been so intense during the past five days, returned\r\nwith redoubled force, and for the first time did his kingly dignity seem\r\na boon. Now he could quench his thirst with what he pleased, and his\r\nfollowers might exhaust the cupboard of its supply of liquor without his\r\nbeing tempted to partake of a single drop.\r\n\r\nMaking his way with difficulty through the ruined building he proceeded\r\nto the court-yard, and, kneeling at the fountain of crystal water, drank\r\nuntil it seemed as if his thirst would never be satiated, while his\r\nsubjects, deeming it their duty to do as he did, filled themselves with\r\nthe cool beverage at imminent danger of bursting, through their excess\r\nof loyal devotion.\r\n\r\nAfter this had been done Philip felt the need of rest, and, lying on the\r\ngreensward under shelter of the awning, prepared to go to sleep.\r\n\r\nIt was a singular spectacle that met his gaze as he raised himself on one\r\nelbow to make sure the apes had not found their way into the kitchen.\r\nThe entire court-yard and veranda were covered with the recumbent forms\r\nof the monkeys, none of whom were probably very sleepy, but all bent\r\non following their king’s example; and in attempting to do this it was\r\nnecessary to pile themselves on top of each other like sardines in a box.\r\n\r\nAlthough the bed was large it was uncomfortably full, and the unpleasant\r\nthought came into Philip’s mind that while remaining upon the island he\r\nwould probably have the same number of bedfellows every night.\r\n\r\nThe strangeness of the situation, however, did not prevent him from\r\nclosing his eyes in slumber, and this blissful unconsciousness might have\r\ncontinued until daybreak had it not been for a decided interruption in\r\nthe shape of a tropical tempest, which came upon them in all its fury\r\njust before midnight.\r\n\r\nIn an instant the court-yard was a scene of the greatest confusion as\r\nthe crowd of apes tried to gain shelter in the adjoining buildings, and\r\nduring the confusion the king’s dignity was completely forgotten.\r\n\r\nEven had the main building been intact it would not have sufficed\r\nto shelter one-fourth of the party, and, half-ruined as it was, only\r\ncomparatively few could find in it a refuge from the rain which poured\r\ndown in torrents.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course this obliged the majority of the troop to flee\r\ntoward the other cottages, and they ran in every direction with\r\napparently not a thought of their recently-returned king. There was no\r\none, however insignificant, who would pause in that tempest to do homage\r\nto the monarch, and in a very few seconds the court-yard was so nearly\r\ndeserted that the king was virtually alone.\r\n\r\nThis was the opportunity for which Philip had longed, and, perhaps\r\nfortunately for him, it had come thus quickly. Now he could steal away\r\nunobserved, and bury what might not inaptly be termed his own bones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nA KINGLY GRAVE-DIGGER.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip had no very clear idea of where the skeleton was hanging. As is\r\nalready known, he had accidentally come upon it during his journey from\r\nthe beach; therefore the mimosas with the sinister-looking fruit were\r\nin a southerly direction from the village, but of more than that he was\r\nignorant.\r\n\r\nTo find this spot in the night, and during the violent tempest, seemed\r\nan impossible task; but yet it must be attempted despite every danger,\r\nbecause such an opportunity might not present itself again for many days.\r\n\r\nHe made his way out through the ruined building, while his followers\r\nscampered in every direction to shelter their bodies from the rain (for\r\na monkey is proverbially afraid of water), and crossed the road into the\r\nthicket without being perceived by any of the startled crowd.\r\n\r\nThere was not the slightest danger of meeting with one of his subjects\r\nduring the journey unless the tempest should cease suddenly and Goliah\r\nsend messengers in search of him; therefore he walked fearlessly forward\r\nafter stopping behind the breastworks thrown up during the battle to arm\r\nhimself with a stout stick, which would serve as a shovel in the task of\r\ngrave-digging.\r\n\r\nThe rain descended in torrents. The wind howled and shrieked among the\r\ntrees, bending them almost to the earth, or here and there uprooting\r\nsome sturdy fellow who refused to bow his crest before the storm, while\r\nfragments of branches, falling in every direction, threatened destruction\r\nto the reckless traveler. The lightning-flashes which darted across the\r\nentire horizon, illuminating during a few seconds the thicket as with the\r\nglare of the noonday sun, served oftentimes to disclose danger in his\r\npath, and it was only from the frequency of these bolts of light that he\r\nwas enabled to make his way with any knowledge of direction.\r\n\r\nHis own skin was dry, although that of his assumed character was heavy\r\nwith water, and, save for the fatigue of rapid walking, he was even more\r\ncomfortable than he would have been in a close room surrounded by his\r\nanimal followers. The knowledge that he had left the apes behind served\r\nto arouse a feeling of exultation, and he bounded forward like a prisoner\r\nwho suddenly sees the road to liberty open before him when he had fancied\r\nhis term of confinement not yet half ended.\r\n\r\nEach time the electric flash came he looked around eagerly in search of\r\nthe mimosas, and more than once did he mistakenly believe he had arrived\r\nat the end of his journey.\r\n\r\nThe storm was still raging furiously when he finally found that for which\r\nhe sought.\r\n\r\nFully two minutes had passed without lightning, and then, as a terrific\r\npeal of thunder was followed by a violent blaze, he saw directly before\r\nhim, swaying to and fro in the wind, the bones of himself—or of his\r\npredecessor, whichever may be the correct term.\r\n\r\nAs a certain well-known author has said: “Man has three distinct\r\ncharacters. Himself as God knows him, himself as his fellows know him,\r\nand himself as he knows himself.” It was this second character which\r\nPhilip wished to hide, and, under the above proposition, could rightfully\r\nbe said to be burying his own skeleton.\r\n\r\nTo dig a grave with a sharpened stick as his only tool was by no means\r\nan easy task, since, owing to the enormous size of the mandrill Captain\r\nSeaworth had killed, it was necessary to make the excavation fully seven\r\nfeet long.\r\n\r\nHe worked, however, as men will when they know their lives depend upon\r\nthe effort. He threw aside the dark loam with feverish haste, regardless\r\nalike of the pitiless rain and the hurtling branches, until, just as\r\nthe storm ceased and the moon peeped out from among the flying clouds\r\nas if for no other purpose than to tint the rattling bones with a most\r\nunearthly radiance, the grave was made, and the time had come when the\r\nskeleton must be cut down from the branches.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course the former king of the island had no trousers\r\npockets, therefore Philip was without a knife; but so strong is instinct\r\nthat he attempted several times to insert his hand into the outer skin\r\nof his leg before realizing that his new clothes contained no convenient\r\nreceptacle for tools. The rope by which the skeleton had been suspended\r\nwas strong and resisted all his efforts to break it. It was necessary to\r\nascend the tree and untie the halter, after which the well-dried anatomy\r\nfell to the ground with a clatter such as the end-man in a minstrel-show\r\nmakes when he wishes to excite the greatest possible applause.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to work now with the utmost haste, for, the tempest\r\nhaving ceased, it was more than probable his followers would soon come\r\nin pursuit, and Philip interred his skeleton with all possible speed,\r\ntrampling the earth down until convinced that only the most careful\r\nscrutiny could reveal his secret.\r\n\r\nThen he retraced his steps as best he could; but more than once did he\r\ndeviate from the proper course, and the result of these involuntary\r\ndetours was that day had already begun to break when he arrived within\r\nsight of the village.\r\n\r\nHere was the loyalty of his subjects made manifest once more. Every\r\nindividual ape had been looking for his king, occupying the piles of\r\nstones or roofs of houses as points of vantage, and when Philip appeared\r\nfrom the thicket a howl of joy went up which seemed to shake the very\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nDuring five hours the animal-trainer had been a man, but now he was an\r\nape again, so to remain until rescuers should arrive or he be tempted to\r\nsteal out once more under the friendly cover of a tempest.\r\n\r\nOf course the first step which either king or peasant would naturally\r\ntake after morning dawned was to procure breakfast, and Philip realized\r\nhow necessary such a course was from the faintness which seized upon him\r\nafter his arduous labors.\r\n\r\nTo enter the kitchen and there satisfy his hunger would be to squander\r\nall the provisions stored in the cupboards, for his subjects would\r\nmake short work of Captain Seaworth’s dainties. Therefore, with a view\r\nof saving the stock for an emergency, Philip led the way, followed by\r\nhundreds of grinning, chattering, frolicsome monkeys, to the banana\r\nplantation, where all were soon busily engaged hunting for the yellow\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nIt was Goliah himself who assumed the task of providing the king with\r\nfood, and when the party had eaten their fill Philip led them back to the\r\nvillage, where for some moments he stood undecided as to how he should\r\nfurther comport himself.\r\n\r\nTo roam about the forest with such a band might be to excite the gravest\r\nsuspicions in the minds of his subjects because of his inability to climb\r\na tree or to swing himself from the branches by the aid of his tail;\r\ntherefore it was necessary he should, so far as possible, remain in the\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the ruined buildings, in front of which were the enormous\r\npiles of stones thrown up as breastworks, gave him a desire to see these\r\nhabitations restored to their former appearance, and the thought came\r\nthat it would not be a long task to raise houses on the same plan, with\r\nwalls formed of the ammunition gathered by the apes.\r\n\r\nIt hardly seemed probable the long-tailed subjects could be made to\r\nact the part of builders, but they would serve to carry the materials\r\nfrom one point to another, and he resolved to set about the work of\r\nreconstructing the settlement as a pleasant and profitable way of\r\nspending his time.\r\n\r\nTo this end he began to drag away the splintered timbers, and instantly\r\na thousand pairs of hands were at work following his example, until all\r\nthe debris had been removed from the proposed site of the building. That\r\nwhich would have required a week of his time was done in an hour, and the\r\namateur architect understood that his labors might yet be crowned with\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThen he placed some of the larger stones on such a line as he intended\r\nthe walls should be erected upon. Instantly every ape on the island was\r\nseized with a mania for building, laboring with such a will that it\r\nrequired all his efforts to restrain what was misdirected zeal, otherwise\r\na wall like that of China might have been put up, provided there had been\r\nsufficient materials at hand.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary he should find something which would serve as mortar;\r\nand to that end, as soon as he could control his too willing subjects he\r\nsearched the store-houses until to his great joy he found at least twenty\r\nbarrels of plaster, which Captain Seaworth had brought in case it might\r\nbe needed for just such a purpose.\r\n\r\nTo have these heavy barrels conveyed to the scene of operations it was\r\nonly necessary for Philip to roll one, when the whole twenty came out\r\nlike horses on a race-track; and as he began to open the plaster and mix\r\nit with water, so did they.\r\n\r\nSeized with a rage for building, they made mortar, broke stone, ran here\r\nand there, and assisted Philip until the entire party were whitened\r\nwith plaster from the ends of their flattened noses to their toes,\r\ncausing them to look like veritable workmen with white over-garments;\r\nbut, unlike other workmen, they neither insisted that eight hours made\r\nup a full day’s work, nor did they idle away valuable time in frivolous\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nBefore the day was half spent Philip began to experience the disagreeable\r\nconsequences of his midnight journey in the rain. His predecessor’s\r\nhide had been thoroughly soaked during the labor of grave-digging, and\r\nnow that the sun sent down his hottest rays the skin began to shrink,\r\naided by the heat of his body and the warmth of the atmosphere, until\r\nit inclosed him as if in a case of iron. Struggle as he might, it was\r\nimpossible to stretch the stout hide by any motion of his body, and\r\nthe cold perspiration gathered on his forehead as he realized what the\r\nposition of affairs would be in case the tightly-fitting garment should\r\nburst asunder.\r\n\r\nHe no longer dared to make any movement, but stood erect with an\r\nexpression of anxiety on his face; and, true to their habits of mimicry,\r\nhis subjects did the same until Philip could not resist the inclination\r\nto laugh aloud as the thought presented itself that it would be\r\nridiculous, indeed, if every member of the party were also waiting with\r\nthe same anxiety to ascertain whether or no his own skin was about to\r\nsplit.\r\n\r\nWhen he burst forth in uncontrollable laughter the entire army of\r\nlaborers did the same until the air resounded with their cries, and once\r\nmore was Philip forced to exercise the greatest caution lest even his own\r\nmirth should hasten the catastrophe he so greatly feared.\r\n\r\nFortunately, however, his predecessor’s hide was now fully shrunken, and\r\nalthough it fitted him quite as tightly as did his own skin, he had every\r\nreason to believe it would remain intact unless he should be so careless\r\nas to make some violent exertion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nA SERIOUS ACCIDENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was only during such times as the work could be pursued that Philip\r\nhad any relief of mind, despite his kingly dignities. When, by example,\r\nhe intimated that the labors of the day might cease, his subjects\r\nexpected him to play the part of ape as heartily as they had enacted the\r\nrole of laborers, and in order to preserve his life he was forced to\r\ncomply with these wishes.\r\n\r\nHolding a court-martial, for the purpose of trying and sentencing alleged\r\noffenders, was the greatest delight of the long-tailed inhabitants, and\r\nonce each day Philip was obliged to sit in solemn state, surrounded by\r\nhis lieutenants, while the number of supposed culprits brought before him\r\nwas always sufficient to furnish the brute dignitaries with the spectacle\r\nof a wholesale flogging.\r\n\r\nIf any of the party were found idle during working-hours they were\r\ncertain of being brought up for judgment, and this fact probably\r\naccounted for the great zeal displayed whenever an example was set before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAt these mock trials Philip remained silent, since it would have been\r\nimpossible for his subjects to understand any decision he might render;\r\nand Goliah took upon himself the duties of judge, looking up now and\r\nthen at the king, as if to make certain he was not assuming too much\r\npower.\r\n\r\nAfter the judicial session was ended the monkeys would separate,\r\nforming bands of two or three hundred, each to go in search of food,\r\nand during such excursions Philip oftentimes found an opportunity to\r\ngain the kitchen unobserved, thus being able to vary the ordinary bill\r\nof fare by some of the dainties which had been so distasteful while he\r\nwas a prisoner in the building. Never once, however, was he tempted to\r\ndrink any of the wine. The remembrance of the days when he so ardently\r\nwished for water, but was unable to procure it, taught him the strictest\r\ntemperance principles.\r\n\r\nEvery morning the apes held what might be called a grand military review,\r\nthe entire body marching in front of the building occupied by their king.\r\nPhilip, and those who attached themselves to his person as a sort of\r\nbody-guard or staff, reviewed the troops with the utmost gravity, after\r\nwhich each ape executed marvelous monkey-maneuvers in the shape of ground\r\nand lofty tumbling, in which it was expected the king would take an\r\nactive part.\r\n\r\nIt was at the first of these parades that Philip understood what was\r\ndemanded of a monarch. After the main body of the party had turned\r\nsomersaults or handsprings all eyes were directed at him, and words were\r\nnot needed to let him know he should perform the same antics.\r\n\r\nThis opportunity of allowing the king to display his agility was never\r\nlost, and after the first exhibition Philip looked forward with fear\r\nand trembling to the moment when he must, before the assembled army, go\r\nthrough such contortions as would have put a professional acrobat to\r\nshame.\r\n\r\nHis method of life, as well as his costume, fitted him to a certain\r\nextent for these extraordinary antics, and while he did not succeed in\r\nperforming them with the skill and agility displayed by his subjects,\r\nthere were plenty of flatterers near at hand to lavish praise upon him as\r\nif he had outdone them all.\r\n\r\nAnd now must be told that which may seem improbable.\r\n\r\nEager for labor, because it brought him relief from close communication\r\nwith his followers, Philip set systematically at work, not only repairing\r\nthe buildings, but laying out roads from one side of the island to\r\nthe other; and this he accomplished with no more assistance than that\r\nafforded by the long-tailed inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIn less than one month the buildings which had been destroyed were\r\nrebuilt in the most substantial manner with walls of stone. Two or three\r\nadditional dwellings were constructed later, and four splendid roads\r\nrunning north, south, east and west, from the village to the sea, were\r\nopened.\r\n\r\nThat which would have taken a small army of laborers many months to\r\naccomplish was completed by the apes in a little more than three weeks.\r\nIt was only necessary for Philip to begin felling trees on the right\r\nand left of the four lines representing the routes to be opened through\r\nthe thicket, when hundreds of pairs of hands were at work pulling up the\r\nunderbrush, tearing down shrubs, and chopping at the tree-trunks with as\r\nmany axes as could be found in the store-room.\r\n\r\nDuring this work in the forest Philip had ample opportunity of noting the\r\nimmense number and variety of spiders and lizards which were to be found\r\non the island.\r\n\r\nIt was a positive pleasure for him to watch the little jumping spiders,\r\nwhich were of such brilliant hue that they looked like animated gems as\r\nthey sprang from bough to bough. The web-spinning species were not only\r\nvery numerous, but caused the greatest annoyance. They stretched their\r\nwebs from one tree to another at such a height as to come in contact with\r\na man’s chin, and the threads were so strong and glutinous as to require\r\nno slight amount of trouble to free one’s self from them. These fellows\r\nwere fully two inches long, with yellow spots on their brown bodies,\r\nwhich gave them a very disagreeable appearance.\r\n\r\nThe apes paid little or no attention to these pests; but Philip could\r\nnever conquer his aversion to the fat-bellied insects, and more than once\r\ndid he make a long detour rather than run the risk of an encounter.\r\n\r\nAs for the lizards, it seemed as if every bush was alive with them.\r\nThey were of all shades—green, gray, brown and black; and even Goliah,\r\nwho delighted in cruelty, never so much as harmed one of these active\r\nlittle hunters, all of whom were busily engaged catching the flies and\r\nmosquitoes, for without such a check to the increase of insect-life the\r\nisland would speedily have become uninhabitable.\r\n\r\nThe work was carried steadily forward, however, despite all annoyances,\r\nand in three weeks from the time Philip Garland became king of the apes\r\nit was possible to sit in the rebuilt tower of the principal dwelling\r\nand view the sea from four different points. Therefore, in case a vessel\r\napproached the island the king would have such timely notice of her\r\ncoming that any signal might be made. It would simply be necessary to\r\nstart a small fire on the beach to have it built to the height of a\r\nmountain by the industrious apes.\r\n\r\nOnly in the hope of relief coming from the sea did Philip succeed in\r\nnerving himself to play the part of a brute. If he could have had a\r\ncompanion with whom to converse, his position would have lost many\r\nhorrors; but to be surrounded by apes was worse than being alone, and,\r\nnext to the arrival of human beings, perfect solitude was the greatest\r\nboon which could have been granted him.\r\n\r\nDuring the labor of road-making Philip noticed that now and then a party\r\nof apes would leave the working portion of the army and absent themselves\r\ntwo or three hours, bringing at the end of that time what appeared, both\r\nfrom shape and size, to be hens’ eggs. These were evidently considered a\r\ngreat delicacy by the apes, and the searchers invariably handed one to\r\nthe king and each of his officers before partaking themselves.\r\n\r\nTo make any attempt at cooking them would have given the apes the idea\r\nof building innumerable small fires, which might soon have consumed\r\nall the vegetation on the island, and Philip ate his raw, as did the\r\nothers. He fancied that some of the colonists’ poultry might have escaped\r\ndestruction, and so eager was he to learn where this article of food\r\ncould be found that on seeing a certain number of apes abandon their\r\nlabors, under Goliah’s direction, he followed. The party went directly\r\nto the sea-shore, and there, just above high-water mark, where a turtle\r\nwould naturally make her nest, were found little piles of sand, in each\r\nof which was a single egg.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before Philip learned that these tiny hills were the\r\nnests of a bird known to naturalists as the “Maleo.”\r\n\r\nA few days later he saw a glossy black and white bird with helmeted head\r\nand elevated tail—not unlike a common fowl, except that the bonnet and\r\nthe tubercles at the nostrils were longer—scraping the sand into little\r\nmounds, and he knew the rare species was before him.\r\n\r\nSome months subsequent to this Philip learned that after the maleo thus\r\ndeposits her eggs she follows the example of the turtle, and pays no\r\nfurther attention to her nest. The sun does the work of maternity, and\r\nthe young chicks are able to take care of themselves on emerging from the\r\nshell.\r\n\r\nWhen all the contemplated work had been finished, Philip was at a loss to\r\nknow how he should employ the large number of his subjects, in order to\r\nfree himself as much as possible from their fawning companionship.\r\n\r\nHe would have built an observatory on the summit of the extinct volcano\r\nbut for the fact that the supply of plaster had already been used in\r\nremodeling the buildings, and it was impossible to quarry rocks of such\r\nsize that they would be held together by their own weight.\r\n\r\nThe readiness with which his subjects copied every movement caused him to\r\nbelieve it might be possible in the near future, unaided by human beings,\r\nto continue the work already begun on the plantation—provided, of course,\r\nhe was not molested by the pirates. This idea came into his mind one day\r\nwhen they were near the base of the volcanic mountain, and he saw what at\r\nfirst glance appeared to be a peach-tree.\r\n\r\nIt was from twenty to thirty feet high, with glossy green leaves, and\r\nbearing small, yellowish flowers at the same time that ripe fruit, not\r\nunlike a peach in size and color, hung upon its branches.\r\n\r\nUp to this moment he had supposed an orange was the only tree which\r\nblossomed while the fruit was ripening, and this singular fact showed him\r\nthe mistake made in believing it to be a peach-tree.\r\n\r\nPicking one of these luscious-looking apples, he found it of a tough,\r\nfleshy consistency, partially split open, and showing within a dark brown\r\nnut covered with crimson mace. It was a nutmeg.\r\n\r\nAs Philip well knew, the Dutch Government had relinquished its monopoly\r\nof the nutmeg trade in these seas, and he speculated, despite the amount\r\nof gold stored in the cavern, whether it would not be possible, with the\r\naid of his long-tailed subjects, to make of this fruitful island one vast\r\nplantation of nutmegs, which would be a source of wealth greater even\r\nthan the bed of the stream could produce.\r\n\r\nAlthough king of apes, he had the natural desire of man to increase his\r\npossessions, and for a time his fancy painted most gorgeous and alluring\r\npictures of what might be done if the energies of the monkeys could be\r\ndirected into the proper channel.\r\n\r\nIt was only when he realized the mischievous propensities of the apes\r\nthat he decided against this pleasant dream. It was hardly probable he\r\ncould restrain them from destroying even fruit which was not palatable;\r\nand he finally confessed to himself, with a sigh, that however absolute\r\nhis power, any attempt to change the nature of his subjects would be\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nDuring the one day of rest in which he allowed his followers to indulge\r\nhe had been forced to make such a display of his supposed apish powers\r\nas thoroughly exhausted him, and, as the only means of utilizing the\r\nsuperfluous energies of the army, he set about exploring more carefully\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nAs may be supposed, his first step was to examine the little harbor where\r\nthe pirates had left their sinister warning and in which the Reynard had\r\nbeen anchored. This was done in the hope of discovering something that\r\nwould show under what circumstances the colonists had embarked.\r\n\r\nSo far as gaining information was concerned he succeeded; but it was\r\nanything rather than satisfactory.\r\n\r\nTwo buoys floating on the water showed that the anchor had not been\r\nweighed. The cables were slipped when the Reynard sailed, and this fact\r\nconvinced Philip that the pirates had left the bay with all possible\r\nspeed, believing the apes were reinforcements of men.\r\n\r\nThis confirmation of his previous theories was a sad blow to the lonely\r\nyouth, who had secretly hoped he might have arrived at a false conclusion\r\nwhen first studying the matter; but it was not long he mourned because\r\nof his friends’ untimely fate, for before that day came to an end he had\r\ngrave cause for fear concerning his own immediate safety.\r\n\r\nIt was on his return from the journey to the sea-shore that Philip had an\r\nopportunity of seeing how wonderfully Nature provides for the wants of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nHe, accompanied by Goliah and followed by the entire army, marched\r\nthrough the dense thickets, where not one breath from the sea could\r\npenetrate to dispel the stifling heat, until the desire for water was\r\nalmost overpowering. In the hope that the huge baboon might know of a\r\nspring near by, Philip gave evidence of intolerable thirst by pointing to\r\nhis mouth and making gestures as if drinking.\r\n\r\nGoliah was equal to the emergency. Walking on a few paces he stopped\r\nbefore a half-vine, half-shrub, which partially clung to the trunk of a\r\ntree and bore huge, bulb-like flowers, shaped something after the fashion\r\nof a pitcher. At the top was a petal which covered an aperture capable of\r\nholding at least half a pint; and tearing this off, the baboon presented\r\nto his king a flagon of water which, although slightly warm, was as\r\npalatable as if it had just been taken from a spring.\r\n\r\nThis was Philip’s first introduction to the “pitcher-plant,” and many\r\ntimes afterward did he quench his thirst from these natural reservoirs.\r\n\r\nThe exploring party returned to the village early in the afternoon. The\r\nking, wearied by the long walk, seated himself near the veranda of the\r\nroyal residence, while Goliah, arrogating to himself the high office of\r\ncommander-in-chief, called out the troops for a second review.\r\n\r\nPhilip could not refuse to witness the evolutions nor to take part\r\nhimself, and his fatigue was so great that he was even more awkward than\r\nusual.\r\n\r\nWhile cutting the most solemn caper, which was accepted by the apes as a\r\nformal military salute, he heard a slight noise immediately in the rear,\r\nand an instant later the loosening of his single garment of skin told\r\nwhat a disaster had befallen him.\r\n\r\nThe hide was split at that place where it had been most used by its\r\nformer owner as well as by Philip, and unless it should be possible to\r\nregain the dwelling without turning his back to the troops the most\r\ndisastrous consequences might ensue.\r\n\r\nBeads of perspiration stood on Philip’s brow as he retreated to a\r\ngigantic bamboo, where it was possible to hide temporarily what the\r\napes might have considered something more than an accident; and during\r\nthe remainder of the review he stood stiff and upright, while his\r\nstaff-officers gazed at him in astonishment which was not mute, because\r\nof the chattering they indulged in among themselves.\r\n\r\nPhilip understood that the first breath of suspicion had fallen upon him,\r\nand instinctively he looked around for a weapon, knowing that Goliah\r\nwould not be slow to take advantage of any opportunity to regain the\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\nA stout piece of bamboo, which had been used during the parade in lieu of\r\na sword by one of the officers, lay upon the ground where Philip could\r\nreach it without exposing the fracture in his garments, and seizing this\r\nhe stood on guard, fully determined to defend himself, even to the death,\r\nin case his counselors or Goliah should insist on his taking part in the\r\nmaneuvers. That he would fall a victim to their wrath the instant the\r\ndeception was made known by the rent was unquestionable; but his kingly\r\ndignity might prevent the greater number of his subjects from crowding\r\ntoo near.\r\n\r\nIn a suspiciously friendly manner Goliah motioned him, when the troops\r\nwere drawn up for the royal salute, to advance and go through the\r\nridiculous antics which he had formerly executed on such occasions.\r\n\r\nPhilip placed his hand on his head, and then on his stomach, as if to\r\nshow that he was suffering from pain. Although the other members of\r\nhis privy counsel appeared satisfied with such an explanation, the huge\r\nbaboon displayed the most lively curiosity. He walked entirely around the\r\nking and the tree against which the latter leaned, but at a respectful\r\ndistance, and then, returning, once more invited the monarch to salute\r\nthe soldiers.\r\n\r\nAgain was the pantomime repeated, and, understanding this controversy\r\ncould not long continue, Philip motioned for the troops to resume their\r\nmarch. He was well aware that because of Goliah’s maneuvres very many\r\nhad grown distrustful; but it was something which could not have been\r\nprevented, and his safety lay in reaching the house.\r\n\r\nOwing to Goliah’s interference, however, the parade was not dismissed\r\nas quickly as under other and more pleasant circumstances. The troops\r\nmarched and countermarched, directed by the baboon, until it seemed to\r\nthe king, whose royal robe was shrinking rapidly, that the pageant would\r\nnever end.\r\n\r\nThe fifteen minutes which passed after his refusal to salute seemed like\r\nso many hours; but the soldiers were finally dismissed, and by a series\r\nof the most extraordinary maneuvers Philip succeeded in reaching the\r\nveranda of his dwelling hardly more alive than dead, while clustered\r\naround him, with anxiety or curiosity written on every face, was a vast\r\nthrong of apes, foremost among whom stood Goliah, glaring in the most\r\nsuspicious manner, as if he fully understood the cause of the king’s\r\ndiscomfiture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nA ROYAL INVALID.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe king of the apes was a voluntary prisoner for a second time.\r\n\r\nOn gaining the building he shut the door in the faces of his anxious and\r\nsuspicious subjects and betook himself once more to the second-story\r\nroom, from the windows of which he had previously waged battle against\r\nthe apes.\r\n\r\nThis apartment, like all others in the house, had been remodeled, and,\r\nthanks to the energy of his subjects, was in a better condition to\r\nwithstand a siege than when he first entered it. During all his labor\r\nhe had kept ever in mind the thought that at some future time it might\r\nbe necessary to have a place of refuge, and to this end he restored the\r\nrooms to their original condition and location, thus giving him, as\r\nbefore, free range from the kitchen to what had been Captain Seaworth’s\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nIt is true the doors were no stronger than before, and should the apes\r\nselect either one of them as a distinct point of attack, it might soon be\r\nbattered down. Against such an event he could take no precautions, but\r\ntrusted that, should another battle ensue, the missiles would be thrown\r\nwith the same absence of studied aim as had been previously displayed.\r\n\r\nArriving in this corner apartment, Philip threw himself in Captain\r\nSeaworth’s chair disheartened and almost weary of life, even though he\r\nwas trying to devise some plan for prolonging it.\r\n\r\nWithout having recourse to a mirror, he knew exactly how large was the\r\nrent in his predecessor’s skin and the difficulties he would have in\r\nrepairing it. Had it been possible to present himself boldly before his\r\nsubjects he might have searched in the other houses of the village and\r\nprobably found needles and thread to repair the damage; but now that he\r\ncould show no more than his face, such an opportunity for benefiting\r\nhimself was out of the question.\r\n\r\nMechanically he looked about him, although every article in the room was\r\nfamiliar, and perhaps he had opened the desk for at least the twentieth\r\ntime, when his eyes fell upon a piece of string.\r\n\r\nIt was what he most needed, and with it the rent made by “envious\r\nfortune” might possibly be repaired.\r\n\r\nTaking off the hide carefully and with considerable difficulty, he found\r\nthat it had been split from just below the jointure of the tail to a\r\ndistance of fully twelve inches straight up the back, and of course in\r\nthat particular place his body would serve to make the opening greater.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to close it as nearly as possible, and with a splinter\r\nof wood as an awl with which to puncture the hide, he finally succeeded\r\nin lacing it up like a shoe.\r\n\r\nThe job was anything rather than satisfactory. The nearest-sighted ape\r\non the island would have perceived at once that there was something the\r\nmatter with the king’s back, and so familiar were Philip’s subjects\r\nwith their monarch, there could be no question about their immediately\r\ninvestigating the cause of his singular appearance. Once curiosity was\r\naroused in this direction the secret must be exposed within a very few\r\nmoments, and he knew that his life would be spared only so long as he\r\nsucceeded in keeping the apes at a proper distance.\r\n\r\nOne can readily imagine his condition of mind when he put on, probably\r\nfor the last time, the dress of skin which had brought him such\r\nquestionable honors and might now prove to be the immediate cause of his\r\ndeath. He could well say “Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown” when\r\nonly the face should be seen by the subjects.\r\n\r\nGoliah’s suspicions were undoubtedly aroused, and beyond a question he\r\nwould be the first, under the guise of excessive loyalty, to discover\r\nwhy the military review had been brought to such an abrupt termination.\r\nTherefore Philip understood that unless he could remain in a sitting\r\nposture during the balance of his reign, discovery of his false character\r\nwas certain, and also that under no circumstances must his followers be\r\nallowed to approach him.\r\n\r\nThe entire night was passed in these gloomy reflections, and when the\r\nfirst gray light of dawn appeared in the sky the chattering of apes under\r\nhis window told Philip that his followers had come to learn the cause of\r\nhis sudden indisposition.\r\n\r\nThat they would remain until he showed himself was absolutely positive,\r\nand without opening the door he stepped from the window to the balcony\r\nas a great howl of joy went up from the assembled throng. They danced\r\nand cut capers as if imploring the king to come down, and at the risk\r\nof disarranging his very tender hide he was obliged to show them many\r\na royal caper before their anxious solicitude could be stilled in the\r\nslightest degree.\r\n\r\nEven after he had executed these dangerous maneuvers, for fully half an\r\nhour did they refuse to be satisfied, and he had good reason to deplore\r\nwhat probably no other king ever did—the intense affection of his\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nNow and then some very zealous monkey clambered up on the balcony to make\r\nsure the monarch was not deceiving them as to the state of his health,\r\nbut at a gesture from him the animal would leap back among the crowd; and\r\nwhen Philip felt certain the lacing of his hide could no longer withstand\r\nthe strain he retreated into the room, taking good care to close the\r\nwindow behind him.\r\n\r\nThat this voluntary imprisonment could not be continued many days he\r\nunderstood before another hour passed. The number of those who were eager\r\nto ascertain the exact condition of their monarch’s health increased each\r\nmoment, and in the absence of a court physician who could issue regular\r\nbulletins regarding the patient it was necessary Philip should show\r\nhimself on the balcony several times during the afternoon, otherwise the\r\nbuilding might have been attacked again.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, he was forced on every occasion to go through the\r\napish capers which were supposed to display affection for his subjects,\r\nand each time a warning rip from behind told that his gestures of love\r\nmust be moderated, otherwise his hide and his reign would soon be at an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nDuring this alternate appearance and disappearance Goliah remained seated\r\namong the feathery branches of a palm which grew directly in front of the\r\nbuilding, and one could almost fancy he was taking notes, so carefully\r\ndid he watch every movement of the king, or so eagerly did he peer around\r\nwhen his majesty retreated.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly to be supposed that the huge baboon would exert himself to\r\nprolong a reign which had begun with his own discomfiture, and on his\r\nlast appearance Philip realized that to again leave the building would\r\nbe to give Goliah an opportunity of pursuing his investigations to a\r\nsuccessful termination.\r\n\r\nTo repel an attack was no longer possible. During the last battle the\r\nammunition had been so far exhausted that not more than twenty cartridges\r\nand one not very serviceable weapon was left. Therefore from force of\r\narms Philip could expect nothing.\r\n\r\nThat evening the animal-trainer who was playing the part of king in\r\nApeland made one more attempt to restore the symbol of his royalty to\r\nits former condition. With infinite care he laced and relaced the rent\r\nuntil he flattered himself it was nearly as well concealed as if done by\r\nthe most skillful tailor, and putting it on again, decided that he might\r\ntrust himself even in the presence of Goliah.\r\n\r\nHis mind was so nearly at ease that he ate a hearty supper from the\r\nstore of provisions in the kitchen pantry and laid himself down to rest,\r\nbelieving he had secured a yet longer lease to the throne of apedom.\r\n\r\nAlas for the vanity of human hopes! Immediately on falling asleep he\r\ndreamed he was once more standing before his army, saluting them with\r\nmighty leaps and wonderful contortions of body. He awakened to find\r\nhimself sprawling on the floor, with the hide of his predecessor slit\r\nfrom the jointure of the tail entirely to the neck!\r\n\r\nHis struggles in dreamland had precipitated the catastrophe. There was\r\nnot string enough in the building to repair this last rent, even had he\r\nbeen sufficiently skillful to thread it into the partially decayed hide.\r\n\r\nTo appear in public on the balcony was no longer possible, and he was\r\na king only while he could remain hidden from view. When the least\r\nintelligent of his subjects got a glimpse of him his crown was lost,\r\nnever more to be recovered, and Goliah would reign in his stead—Goliah,\r\nfrom whom he might expect the most cruel reprisals for the temporary\r\nloss of power.\r\n\r\nPhilip was so certain a cruel fate awaited him that he immediately began\r\nto barricade the suite of apartments as thoroughly as possible under the\r\ncircumstances, and before another morning dawned every movable article of\r\nfurniture was piled against the doors in the hope that the final moment\r\nmight be delayed a short time.\r\n\r\nThen, retreating to the kitchen, he awaited the inevitable.\r\n\r\nFrom this retired spot he could hear the chattering and howling of his\r\nsubjects as they assembled once more to make inquiries concerning his\r\nhealth, and he knew beyond a peradventure that not many hours would\r\nelapse before they began to force their way into the building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nEXCESSIVE AFFECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip’s dismal forebodings were destined to be realized within a very\r\nshort time. If his subjects had been impatient on the day previous\r\nbecause they only saw him on the balcony, they were furious now when the\r\nwindows and doors remained closed and their king came not forth to greet\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFrom his place of refuge he could hear a murmuring sound, as of the\r\nwaves on the sea-shore; but after an hour passed this had increased to a\r\ndeafening roar, which was echoed and re-echoed from every portion of the\r\nforest until it seemed as if the entire island must be covered with apes\r\nsearching for their ruler.\r\n\r\nNow and then the fugitive could hear a hoarse cry, which arose above the\r\ngeneral din, and in it he believed he recognized Goliah’s voice. The huge\r\nbaboon, who had been only suspicious on the day previous, was probably\r\npositive now that the king was not all he should be, and was most likely\r\ninciting the multitude to open rebellion.\r\n\r\nJudging from the events which followed, it was not a hard task to induce\r\nthese long-tailed subjects to rise in their might, for before noon the\r\nattack was begun.\r\n\r\nThe apes, probably understanding that they could not learn the cause of\r\nthe king’s indisposition and sudden disappearance except by demolishing\r\nthe building which they themselves had reared, made a furious attack on\r\nall four sides at the same moment.\r\n\r\nFrom previous experience Philip knew that in this assault they must\r\nnecessarily be successful owing to their numbers, and also because it was\r\nno longer possible for him to interpose any lengthy resistance; therefore\r\nhe remained in one corner of the kitchen, with the musket in his hands\r\nand the small amount of ammunition in his pocket, resolved to sell his\r\nlife dearly when the supreme moment should arrive.\r\n\r\nAgainst the sides of the building the heavy missiles rattled like hail;\r\nthe walls shook under the repeated blows, and now and then the crashing\r\nand splintering of roof-timbers told that slowly but surely Philip’s\r\nplace of refuge was being reduced to a ruin.\r\n\r\nAt rare intervals the bombardment ceased as the entire army burst forth\r\nin noisy cries of grief, deafening howls of sympathy, and groans which\r\nwere intended to be expressive of tenderness.\r\n\r\nThis mourning for their king was always followed by a more vigorous\r\nonslaught, and, as near as Philip could judge, it was about the hour of\r\nsunset when the building gave way beneath a shower of rocks. First a\r\nheavy crash from above told that the roof had fallen; then the front wall\r\nwas forced in, probably burying amid its ruins the papers and books of\r\nCaptain Seaworth, and causing Philip’s hiding-place to rock to and fro\r\nlike a tree shaken by the wind.\r\n\r\nFinally there came that which Philip had not anticipated.\r\n\r\nInstead of the dwelling being demolished in such a manner that he was\r\nexposed to view, the walls, besieged on every side, fell inward; and\r\nat the last deafening crash he commended himself to God, for it seemed\r\npositive he was buried alive.\r\n\r\nIn the brief space of time which elapsed from the first shattering of the\r\nside-wall until the end came Philip thought, with intense relief, that he\r\nwould be crushed to death rather than murdered by those who had been so\r\nloyal a few days previous. Then the ceiling and sides of the room burst\r\nin, sending forth great clouds of dust, which from the outside must have\r\nlooked like smoke ascending from a funeral pyre.\r\n\r\nThe assailants were silenced—awed by their work. The building was nothing\r\nmore than a mass of ruin, but yet no trace of their king could be seen.\r\n\r\nLooking from the outside, one would have said there could be no living\r\nthing beneath these enormous fragments of rock and wood; and yet, strange\r\nas it may seem, Philip was there with not so much as a single scratch\r\nupon his body. It was destined that his life should not be taken by his\r\nsubjects during an assault planned by Goliah.\r\n\r\nThe heavy furniture, piled up from the door of the cupboard to the\r\ncorner of the room as a barricade in case the apes succeeded in entering\r\nthe building, had been sufficient to uphold the weight which fell upon\r\nit, and the timbers of the ceiling had formed across the top a perfect\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nThe king of the apes, whose reign had been of such short duration,\r\nwas thus literally buried alive; but in this accidental tomb he had\r\nprovisions sufficient to serve him many days.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments after the falling of the timbers Philip congratulated\r\nhimself upon this fact; but his joy was short-lived. He soon realized\r\nthat unless—as was improbable—he could have aid from the outside, the\r\nstock of provisions would simply serve to prolong his wretched life a\r\ncertain time, after which death must inevitably come.\r\n\r\n“At all events I need not starve,” he said to himself after some\r\nreflection, as he raised his musket; and with the knowledge that he could\r\ninvoke death before the torture of hunger and thirst became agonizing, he\r\ngrew more resigned.\r\n\r\nThen came a long time of silence, which was finally broken by the sound\r\nas of some one digging from above.\r\n\r\n“Probably the night has passed, during which the apes were asleep, and\r\nnow they are searching for my body,” Philip said to himself; and although\r\nhe knew death would be inevitable in case of discovery (for the mandrill\r\nskin had literally been torn from his body), it was with a certain sense\r\nof relief he learned that the debris from above was being removed.\r\n\r\nYet one does not welcome death, however full of torture may be the\r\nalternative; and when the noise made by the army of laborers grew more\r\ndistinct, telling that they were approaching nearer to his narrow prison\r\neach moment, the thought of the struggle which must ensue was very\r\npainful. With twenty cartridges he would hardly be able to hold the first\r\nsquad of laborers in check sixty seconds. Then, unarmed, he must meet\r\nthose whom he had so unwittingly deceived.\r\n\r\nAs the moments passed he was able to form a definite idea of the approach\r\nof his enemies, for in such a light must he now consider his former\r\nsubjects. Already could he see tiny rays of light through the crevices of\r\nthe rocks and timbers, and the shower of dust which fell upon him told\r\nthat but a few feet of the debris remained between him and the open air.\r\n\r\nNow he clutched his musket more firmly and stood on the alert, prepared\r\nto spring forward at the instant the aperture was sufficiently large to\r\nadmit of the passage of his body, although he knew that the ruins were\r\nsurrounded by an army so great that it would be impossible to make his\r\nway twenty feet before receiving a death-wound.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment, when he had nerved himself for the struggle he\r\nbelieved was about to ensue, that he felt, rather than heard, a noise\r\ndirectly beneath his feet, and even while wondering as to the cause of it\r\nan upheaval of the floor told that the enemy were searching for him both\r\nabove and below.\r\n\r\nThen one of the boards upon which he stood was pushed aside, almost\r\noverturning him, and he leveled his musket, ready to fire when they\r\nshould spring upon him out of what was evidently a tunnel.\r\n\r\nThe fragments from above had been so far removed by this time that the\r\ndarkness was partially dispersed, allowing him to see everything in the\r\nvicinity quite distinctly.\r\n\r\nAn ape’s head presented itself from this unexpected aperture, and, in\r\norder to save his ammunition as far as possible, Philip raised his musket\r\nto strike. Another instant and there would have been one ape the less on\r\nthe island—an event well calculated to plunge the prisoner into an agony\r\nof grief.\r\n\r\nIt was the chimpanzee, Ben Bolt, and not one of Goliah’s adherents, who\r\nhad thus come from the very earth, as it were; and an instant later the\r\nbesieged youth was shaking the animal by the paw as if he were a human\r\nbeing, for there could be no question but that the two chimpanzees had\r\nformed some plan to extricate their old master from his perilous position.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to be wasted in ceremonies, however. The laborers above\r\nhad so nearly reached the tiny place of refuge that fragments of stone\r\nwere already falling between the timbers, and the chimpanzee realized\r\nquite as well as did Philip that to make this means of escape practicable\r\nthey must beat an immediate retreat.\r\n\r\nThe former stood at the edge of the tunnel and pointed downward with an\r\nimpatient gesture.\r\n\r\nPhilip descended into a narrow excavation barely large enough to admit of\r\nhis crawling on his hands and knees; and here, as if waiting for him, was\r\nthe other chimpanzee, who immediately led the way through the passage,\r\nassuring herself that he would follow by winding her long tail around his\r\nneck in such a manner that he must perforce be dragged if he could not\r\ncreep.\r\n\r\nHad a spectator been in the place so lately occupied by Philip he would\r\nhave seen Ben Bolt pull the furniture together even above his head, and\r\nthen, retreating into the hole, drag some of the floor-boards after him\r\nto hide the existence of the tunnel.\r\n\r\nIn this he displayed reasoning powers beyond a peradventure, for those\r\nwho were working above would, on reaching the bottom, find no evidences\r\nof an excavation, and it was hardly probable they would pursue their\r\ninvestigation any further than the floor of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nTHE RETREAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip did not attempt to speculate upon the intelligence displayed by\r\nthe chimpanzees as he half-followed and was half-dragged along the narrow\r\ntunnel by Alice.\r\n\r\nThat these two had recognized in the king of the apes their old master\r\nwhose life they had previously tried to save there could be no question,\r\nfor on entering the narrow hiding-place in the house Ben Bolt had shown\r\nno surprise at finding confined there a man instead of an ape; and on her\r\npart, Alice acted as if recognizing the object of their search.\r\n\r\nBoth these animals must have been aware of the deception practiced upon\r\nthe other apes and received some inkling of the true state of affairs,\r\notherwise they would not have been so prompt in making this excavation\r\nfor the purpose of rescuing him.\r\n\r\nThe labor they had performed was prodigious, as Philip understood while\r\ncreeping along the tunnel; for, although they moved at a reasonably rapid\r\npace, it was fully twenty minutes before the three emerged into a thicket\r\nof mimosas directly back of Ben Bolt’s former prison, and to the fugitive\r\nit seemed certain these animals must have commenced their labors on the\r\nvery night when the first mishap occurred to the skin of royalty.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Goliah had made his suspicions public; or perhaps, again, Ben\r\nBolt or Alice witnessed the first accident, and understanding who had\r\nbeen masquerading under the guise of the king, immediately formed a\r\nplan for his liberation. In either case the result of their labors\r\nwas certainly brought about by reason rather than instinct, and the\r\nanimal-trainer thought with a certain chagrin of the time when he\r\nbelieved apes could only be taught by example emphasized with severe\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nOn emerging from the tunnel Philip could hear the shouts and cries of the\r\napes who were searching the ruins; but the thicket of mimosas hid him\r\nfrom their view, and after beating down the ground as well as possible to\r\nhide any evidence of the existence of the tunnel, Ben Bolt motioned for\r\nPhilip to follow him.\r\n\r\nWith Alice bringing up the rear, all three pushed forward at the utmost\r\nspeed until they arrived at the mouth of the grotto in which Philip had\r\npreviously taken refuge.\r\n\r\nSince Goliah was in command of the apes the two chimpanzees were exposed\r\nto as much danger as their human comrade, for the huge baboon would\r\nundoubtedly make Ben Bolt a prisoner once more in order to separate him\r\nfrom his mate; and, therefore, Philip understood that he was to have the\r\ncompanionship of these beasts during such time as it might be necessary\r\nto remain in hiding.\r\n\r\nThe grotto was far from being a secure place of retreat, since at any\r\nmoment a squad of apes might pass that way, and Philip now took upon\r\nhimself the part of conductor, leading the animals directly into the\r\nsubterranean chambers which he had discovered.\r\n\r\nHere they could have light to a certain degree, water from the numberless\r\nstreams, and plenty of food in the shape of fish; therefore their\r\nvoluntary imprisonment might be monotonous but not painful, however long\r\na time it should continue.\r\n\r\nIt was probable Goliah’s forces would discover these under-ground\r\nchambers, and to guard as far as possible against what might prove a dire\r\ncalamity, Philip set about filling the passage leading from the grotto\r\nwith fragments of limestone, taken from the chamber of statutes.\r\n\r\nIn this work he was aided by the chimpanzees very materially, and before\r\nthree hours had passed they were in what appeared to be an impregnable\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nSo far as Philip had discovered there was no means of entrance to the\r\nsubterranean chamber save through the grotto, and with the tunnel\r\nhalf-filled by rocks, there was every reason to believe a siege could\r\nbe sustained indefinitely. The animals appeared to understand quite as\r\nwell as did their human companion that they were comparatively safe\r\nfrom Goliah and his forces, and hand in hand they wandered through the\r\ncaverns, uttering exclamations of surprise or chattering with each other\r\nin a low tone, but returning to Philip every moment to make sure he\r\nwould not again disappear from their view.\r\n\r\nA dinner and supper of boiled fish, then a long time of unbroken repose,\r\nand another day dawned.\r\n\r\nDuring the hours devoted to slumber Philip had resolved that, in order to\r\noccupy his mind and provide the needful exercise for all, he would again\r\ntake up his work of gathering gold, although it might not be possible to\r\ncarry it away. When breakfast had been cooked in the boiling spring, and\r\neaten, he motioned for the chimpanzees to follow him down the course of\r\nthe stream.\r\n\r\nIn order to make them understand what he wished to do, it was only\r\nnecessary to take from the water a few of the yellow nuggets, compare\r\nthem with bits of limestone to show the difference in color, and then\r\ncarry them to the hiding-place behind the statue. One example was\r\nsufficient, and without delay the animals set about gathering the\r\ntreasure, so useless while Philip remained on the island, but of such\r\ngreat value if he could succeed in conveying it to any civilized portion\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nIt was not his intention to make of this treasure-gathering absolute\r\nlabor, but only to perform so much of it as would give the needed\r\nexercise in confinement; and after the chimpanzees had worked\r\nindustriously three hours he motioned for them to desist.\r\n\r\nStretched out on the cool white sand in the cavern nearest the grotto,\r\nall three of the fugitives enjoyed a most pleasant siesta. They\r\ncould contrast the heat outside with the refreshing coolness of the\r\nunder-ground residence, and Philip admitted to himself that to remain\r\nshut up here several weeks might not be as unpleasant as would seem at\r\nfirst thought.\r\n\r\nThus alternately working and resting, the time passed at a reasonably\r\nrapid rate until Philip judged that one week of this voluntary\r\nimprisonment had elapsed.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time nothing had been heard from the apes, and the\r\nchimpanzees no longer acted as if fearing each moment their enemies\r\nwould find them out. Even Philip felt reassured on this point, and was\r\nbeginning to make preparations for sending Ben Bolt on a reconnoitering\r\nexpedition, or of going himself, when loud shouts from the outside\r\nproclaimed the fact that Goliah’s army had at last discovered their\r\nhiding-place.\r\n\r\nEven now Philip felt but little alarm, for by barricading the tunnel it\r\nwould be possible to hold the entire force at bay.\r\n\r\nGoliah, however, did not propose to let his army expend their energy and\r\ntime in shrieking. About noon on the eighth day of Philip’s voluntary\r\nimprisonment the sounds from the grotto proclaimed the fact that the\r\nenemy were making preparations for entering the passage.\r\n\r\nAt the first alarm the chimpanzees were nearly beside themselves with\r\nfright; but after observing Philip’s calm demeanor they appeared to gain\r\nconfidence, and in less than an hour both were sufficiently composed to\r\nrender such aid as their human companion required.\r\n\r\nThe work of maintaining a defense was not arduous. It consisted simply\r\nin breaking the naturally-formed statues into fragments—which was easily\r\ndone owing to the porous nature of the stone—and packing the pieces into\r\nthe passage as fast as the wall gave evidence of being weakened by the\r\nbesiegers.\r\n\r\n“They may go on with that sort of work for a month without being able to\r\nget at us,” Philip said, much as if the chimpanzees needed encouragement\r\nand could understand what he said. “We have only to keep on hand a\r\nplentiful supply of material, and the advantage will all be on our side.”\r\n\r\nBefore the day came to an end the animals had learned so well what was\r\nnecessary that their companion had no hesitation about trusting them to\r\ncontinue the defense while he caught and prepared fish for supper.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the enemy remained silent, but at the first break of day\r\nthe attack was continued—this time so methodically that the forenoon was\r\nbut half spent when the barricade was so far destroyed that Philip could\r\nsee the besiegers at the further end of the tunnel.\r\n\r\nThey labored in couples, dragging out the rocks and passing them to those\r\nin the rear, who formed a long chain to the outer end of the grotto,\r\nwhere the fragments were thrown down the incline at such a point that the\r\nmovement of the army would not be impeded.\r\n\r\nIn this order of working it was possible for them to gain very materially\r\nupon the defenders of the cavern, and for the first time since having\r\ntaken refuge in this place Philip began to fear they might eventually be\r\ndragged from what he had believed was a secure retreat, unless it should\r\nbe possible to change their own plan.\r\n\r\nIt was while he stood at the mouth of the tunnel trying to devise some\r\nmeans of accelerating the work of defense that he was startled by hearing\r\nthe report of a cannon in the distance.\r\n\r\nHis companions immediately rushed to his side, as if understanding that\r\nthis booming noise meant deliverance for him whom they had labored so\r\nhard; and while the three were listening intently a second report was\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nNow the besiegers began to understand that something unusual was\r\noccurring on the island, and when the third report rang out on the still\r\nair Philip shouted, in a loud voice:\r\n\r\n“A vessel has come! Captain Seaworth has returned, and we shall be able\r\nto leave this terrible place!”\r\n\r\nThe besiegers, confounded and uneasy because of the detonations, which\r\nwere several times repeated by the echoes, came to a decided stand-still,\r\nwhile Goliah, who was stationed just inside the grotto, leaned forward,\r\nsniffing the air and showing every symptom of uneasiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE RETURN OF THE COLONISTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith stones in their hands, muzzles turned in the direction of the wind,\r\noutstretched necks, hair standing on end, and ears pricked up, the apes\r\ntried to realize what Philip himself would have been only too well\r\npleased to understand.\r\n\r\nThere could be no question but that a vessel was near, yet there were\r\nmany chances that Philip’s first explanation of the reason of the\r\ncannonading was not the true one.\r\n\r\nIn the cavern it was impossible to say that a tempest might not be\r\nraging, and the ship, having struck a reef, was signaling for assistance.\r\nOr, again, the Malay pirates were perhaps attacking some vessels close\r\nunder the lee of the land. In fact, there were very many ways of\r\nexplaining the reasons for this discharge of ordnance without attributing\r\nit to the return of the colonists, and Philip’s first flush of joy was\r\nimmediately turned to anxiety.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour passed, during which the besiegers remained like statues,\r\ngazing toward the sea; and then, to Philip’s intense relief and almost\r\noverwhelming happiness, came the sound of human voices.\r\n\r\nThe apes appeared to be more and more astonished. The greater number\r\nlooked frightened, and were already seeking with furtive glances\r\nfavorable openings for immediate flight. Goliah alone remained firm; but\r\nit was possible to tell from the expression of his face that he shared\r\nvery sensibly in the alarm of his subjects.\r\n\r\nFive minutes more passed, and Philip fancied he could hear the tramp of\r\nmany feet in the distance, when Goliah gave vent to a shrill, piercing\r\nwhistle, and in an instant every one of the besiegers disappeared. Not a\r\nsingle ape remained in front of the grotto, and only for a few seconds\r\ncould Philip see their vanishing tails as they sought refuge in the\r\nthicket.\r\n\r\nNow, instead of trying to fill up the tunnel, those in the subterranean\r\nchamber began tearing away at the rocks with feverish energy; and five\r\nminutes later Philip, followed by the two chimpanzees, emerged from the\r\ngrotto into one of the broad roads built under his supervision as king,\r\ndown which could be seen a large body of men, in the immediate vicinity\r\nof the village.\r\n\r\nTo run forward at the swiftest possible pace was the most natural thing\r\nfor Philip to do, and in a few moments he was standing before Captain\r\nSeaworth, muttering incoherent words expressive of his deep joy, while\r\nthe two chimpanzees followed close behind him, looking as if they also\r\nwere relieved in mind by the coming of human beings.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Philip, covered as he was with the fragments of an\r\nape’s skin, caused the most profound astonishment among those who had\r\njust landed.\r\n\r\nThey looked upon him as if believing that he was a veritable wild man,\r\nand not a few gave way at his approach, fearing he might inflict some\r\ninjury upon them.\r\n\r\nAlthough Captain Seaworth and several of his officers were well\r\nacquainted with Philip Garland, the animal-trainer, they failed to\r\nrecognize in this forlorn-looking specimen of humanity the once\r\nprosperous merchant, and after gazing at him several moments in\r\nundisguised astonishment the captain asked, sternly:\r\n\r\n“Who are you?”\r\n\r\n“A shipwrecked youth, whose life has been in danger during the past three\r\nmonths.”\r\n\r\n“One would say you were more ape than human,” the captain replied with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n“And so I have been; but now the time has come when I can assume my\r\nproper place among human beings. This hide is not mine.”\r\n\r\n“Which is lucky for you,” one of the officers added, and several laughed\r\nheartily, “otherwise we might think it a deed of charity to finish\r\nskinning you.”\r\n\r\nThen Captain Seaworth, looking at the chimpanzees as if he recognized\r\nthem, asked:\r\n\r\n“How comes it that you have adopted two of my former pets as your\r\nservants?”\r\n\r\n“These are animals which I once owned and trained, and afterward sold\r\nto you, captain,” Philip said laughingly; and the gentleman, looking up\r\nquickly, repeated:\r\n\r\n“You sold them to me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I am, or at least I was, Philip Garland, dealer in wild animals,\r\nand sold you these chimpanzees, together with a baboon which I wish had\r\nbeen killed years ago.”\r\n\r\nIt is needless to describe the astonishment caused by these words. In\r\nthis youth, only partially covered with the tattered skin of an ape,\r\nand with matted and disheveled hair, the officers of the Reynard began\r\nto distinguish some familiar features, and a moment later Philip was\r\noverwhelmed with questions.\r\n\r\nTo tell his story would require no slight amount of time, and he proposed\r\nthat it be delayed until a more fitting moment, for he, in turn, was\r\neager to learn the reasons of the colonists’ sudden departure; therefore\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n“Inasmuch as your leaving the island has caused me no slight amount of\r\nuneasiness and mystification, and can be told more quickly than my story,\r\nsuppose you first explain. This evening you shall learn the particulars\r\nof my reign, for during at least half of my stay here I have been king of\r\nthe apes.”\r\n\r\n“It will require but a few words to clear up what has seemed a mystery\r\nif, as I presume, you have already seen the log-book.”\r\n\r\n“I have, and the last page in it contained an account of the pirates’\r\nwarning which was found on the beach.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” the captain replied. “In regard to that, Mr. Clark evidently\r\noverlooked the weapon on the previous day, for before nightfall we saw\r\nthe Malay fleet in the offing. It was composed of so many proas that\r\nto give battle would have been the height of foolishness, and in the\r\nleast possible time we embarked on the Reynard, slipping her cables and\r\nstanding out to sea. It was better to lose our property than run the risk\r\nof losing our lives.\r\n\r\n“The people were making preparations for a ball, and no work was being\r\ndone on the plantation, therefore it was possible to embark in less\r\nthan an hour from the time of the first alarm; but to save any of the\r\nhousehold goods was out of the question. The papers relating to the\r\nsettlement of the island I intended to take with me; but in the hurried\r\ndeparture they, like a great many other things, were forgotten until\r\nit was so late that to return for them would have been the height of\r\nimprudence, and we abandoned everything with the faint hope of recovering\r\nthe property on our return.\r\n\r\n“A running fight could be made provided we succeeded in preventing the\r\npirates from boarding us; and with a ten-knot breeze we dashed through\r\nthe fleet without receiving any injury. They opened fire as a matter of\r\ncourse; but those scoundrels do not count upon a fight at long range,\r\nbecause their weapons are not calculated to do much execution from a\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n“We were not idle. Every gun of the six we had on board was trained with\r\ngood effect, and before they could crawl out of range we sank three\r\nproas. Two more of the crafts were disabled, and one was so splintered\r\nabout the hull that before we were out of sight her crew took to the\r\nboats. It was a lesson which I fancy they will not forget for some time;\r\nand now that we are to have such an increase of numbers, it will be a\r\nvery long while before the pirates, either from Sooloo or Magindinao,\r\ndare to pay us a visit.\r\n\r\n“We made Batavia in due course of time, took on more colonists, and\r\narranged for a large number to follow. They will be here in a few days,\r\nand I have returned to complete our work; but I fancy quite as much has\r\nbeen destroyed by the apes as would have been had the pirates landed,\r\nalthough I am surprised at seeing these magnificent thoroughfares, which\r\nmust have cost no small amount of time and labor.”\r\n\r\n“As king of the apes I have been able to do the colony some good,”\r\nPhilip replied. “These roads were laid out by my subjects, and as far as\r\npossible I have endeavored to repair the buildings which they destroyed\r\nduring the first battle; but of this I shall tell you later.”\r\n\r\nThen Captain Seaworth and his officers, eager to hear Philip’s story,\r\nproposed that all go on board the Reynard, where the unfortunate man\r\ncould procure suitable garments; and while the colonists were engaged in\r\nascertaining the amount of damage done the dwellings the little party\r\nwent to the coast, the chimpanzees following Philip very closely, as if\r\nonly in his presence could they hope for protection from the vengeful\r\nGoliah.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of that day was spent as far as Captain Seaworth and his\r\nofficers were concerned, in listening to Philip’s adventures, and when\r\nnight came one can well fancy the happy sense of relief and security\r\nwhich the animal-trainer experienced on being able to lie down once more\r\nin a bed with no fear of an attack from the apes.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that the chimpanzees should be allowed to go whithersoever\r\nthey pleased; but after the first visit to the ship no amount of\r\npersuasion could induce them to go on shore again. They appeared to\r\nrealize that only there were they safe, and having been given quarters in\r\na shanty which the carpenter built on deck, they were apparently the most\r\ncontented of all the ship’s company.\r\n\r\nNot until the following day, while the workmen were engaged in restoring\r\nthe buildings and otherwise putting the settlement into the same shape\r\nas it had been at the time of their departure, did Philip tell Captain\r\nSeaworth of the discovery he had made in the subterranean chamber. Had he\r\nrelated this portion of his adventures in public the work of establishing\r\nthe plantation would have been speedily abandoned, for once the fever for\r\ngold attacks man all industries languish, and the idea of gaining wealth\r\nfrom the bed of the under-ground stream would have been more disastrous\r\nto the colony than many visits from the pirates.\r\n\r\nEven Captain Seaworth was undecided as to what should be done. He fully\r\nrealized the danger attending his enterprise should this discovery be\r\nmade known, and after much thought he said to Philip:\r\n\r\n“We will let this remain a secret between you and me for the present.\r\nYou can at different times convey the gold which has been gathered to my\r\nhouse, or to the ship, without letting any of the colonists know what\r\nyou are doing. Only in the event of our failing to make of this island a\r\nfruitful plantation will we acquaint even my most trusty officers with\r\nthis new source of wealth.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nA BOATSWAIN’S FATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, Philip was enabled to resume his proper\r\nhabiliments as soon as he stepped on board the Reynard, Captain Seaworth\r\nsupplying him with a full outfit, and it was with no slight degree of\r\nsatisfaction that he surveyed himself in the mirror.\r\n\r\nHis long and peculiar residence on the island rendered him a valuable\r\nadviser to Captain Seaworth, and it was decided that during such\r\ntime as he would be obliged to remain, owing to the limited means of\r\ntransportation, he was to act as a member of the board of directors.\r\n\r\nThe first labor the colonists engaged in was the repairing of the houses\r\nwhich had been injured during the last siege. Then every dwelling was\r\nfortified, as far as possible, for it was not to be supposed that such a\r\nlarge body of apes, having once had possession of the settlement, would\r\nremain very long at a respectful distance.\r\n\r\nPhilip’s advice to Captain Seaworth was that before anything was done\r\ntoward restoring the plantations to their former condition some means\r\nbe devised for ridding the island of the mischievous and vindictive\r\nanimals. To plant anew would be only to provide something for the apes\r\nto destroy, and it was by no means safe for the male colonists to go\r\ninto the fields, leaving the cottages unprotected, since Goliah might\r\nlead his forces to an attack at any moment; therefore if the scheme of\r\ntransforming the island into a garden was to be carried out, the first\r\nand all-important task was the destruction or subjugation of the apes.\r\n\r\nNo one knew better than Philip how difficult would be such a task. At\r\nthe very lowest computation there were two thousand of these long-tailed\r\nbrutes against whom war must be waged, and, as has already been shown,\r\nthey were no mean antagonists. One such as Goliah would be more than a\r\nmatch for three unarmed men, and the strictest orders were issued that\r\nthe colonists should only go from one point to another when in large\r\nnumbers, and with sufficient weapons to repel any onslaught which might\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\nThis order was promulgated on the afternoon of the same day the Reynard\r\nentered the little cove, and before twelve hours had elapsed those of the\r\ncolonists who thought such a precaution foolish were fully convinced of\r\nits wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe boatswain of the ship, whose constant boast it was that he could\r\novercome, single-handed, any three men who might be opposed to him,\r\nlaughed at the idea of banding together to resist an attack by monkeys,\r\nand openly declared that he was not afraid of all the apes in the\r\nMalay Archipelago. He even went so far as to intimate that Philip was\r\nlittle less than a chicken-hearted fellow to allow himself to be made\r\na prisoner by such animals, and to do their bidding like a slave. In\r\nfact, he did not hesitate to say he doubted Mr. Garland’s story very\r\nseriously, and otherwise made so much sport of the “Munchausen Tales,” as\r\nhe called them, that many of the colonists were disposed to share in his\r\nincredulity.\r\n\r\nAt about four o’clock in the afternoon Captain Seaworth decided to have\r\none of the small cannon brought from the Reynard for the better defense\r\nof the village, and instructed the boatswain to proceed to the ship with\r\na sufficient number of men for mutual protection.\r\n\r\n“I am going alone,” the old sailor said when he emerged from the\r\ncaptain’s temporary dwelling, speaking to a number of his comrades with\r\nwhom he had previously been discussing the alleged facts of Philip’s\r\nstory. “I’ll make it my business to walk half-around the island just to\r\nshow how much truth there is in the yarn of this monkey-trainer, who has\r\nbeen scared out of his senses by two or three tame baboons.”\r\n\r\nOf course this would be a total disregard of the captain’s express\r\ncommands; but the boatswain flattered himself that his disobedience would\r\nnot be known save to those in whose eyes he wished to appear as a hero,\r\nand away he started, armed only with a stout cudgel, which he declared\r\nwas enough to frighten all the apes on the island into convulsions.\r\n\r\nThree hours later, the piece of ordnance not having arrived, Captain\r\nSeaworth sent half a dozen colonists to the ship, and in due time they\r\nreturned with the information that the boatswain had not arrived at the\r\ncoast. The foolhardy man had been absent from the settlement sufficiently\r\nlong to have made four or five trips to the tiny harbor, and, believing\r\nhis desire to show contempt for the apes had resulted in a catastrophe,\r\nthose who heard his boasts laid the matter before the captain and Philip.\r\n\r\nIt was then too late to make any search for the unfortunate man, since\r\nnight, which comes on so suddenly in the tropics, was already close at\r\nhand, and it would be worse than reckless to venture into the thicket\r\nwhere the animals could so readily conceal themselves.\r\n\r\nThat Goliah and his forces had taken the boatswain prisoner, even if they\r\nhad not murdered him, Philip felt certain; but nothing could be done\r\nuntil morning, and immediately after sunrise fifty well-armed men set\r\nout, following as nearly as possible the supposed direction in which he\r\nhad gone.\r\n\r\nThe search was not of long duration. When the party arrived within a\r\nhundred yards of the terminus of the road leading to the south they saw\r\nthat which caused the stoutest-hearted to draw back with a shudder.\r\n\r\nHanging to the lower limb of a mangrove-tree, exactly as Philip had seen\r\nthe skeleton of the mandrill suspended, was the unfortunate boatswain.\r\nThe rope for the execution of the deed had been formed from strips of\r\nhis clothing, and a party of Western lynchers could not have done the\r\ndeed more thoroughly.\r\n\r\nFrom such slight evidence as could be seen among the underbrush or\r\nfoliage, it was not probable the sailor had had an opportunity to defend\r\nhimself more than a few seconds. Most likely Goliah’s forces leaped upon\r\nhim so quickly, and in such numbers, that before he could strike many\r\nblows he was over-powered; but that he was alive when suspended from the\r\ntree could be readily seen.\r\n\r\nAfter the unfortunate man was given a Christian burial there was not one\r\namong the colonists who questioned any detail of Philip’s story, however\r\nimprobable it may have seemed. Now that there could be no question as to\r\nthe dangers which menaced, Captain Seaworth resolved to rid the island of\r\nthe brutes, if possible; and to this end, acting under Philip’s advice,\r\nhe went to work systematically.\r\n\r\nThe buildings were left in charge of forty well-armed men, and the\r\nstrictest orders issued against the women venturing out of doors under\r\nany pretense. Then all save a force necessary to guard the ship were set\r\nat work cutting paths through the thicket at different angles from the\r\nsettlement, in order that there should be no opportunity of concealment\r\nfor the apes within reach of the house.\r\n\r\nThis task required no small amount of labor, and three days elapsed\r\nbefore the colonists were in condition to open the battle.\r\n\r\nDuring this time they had every evidence that Goliah’s forces were\r\nwatching them intently, for more than once could be heard shrill cries in\r\nthe thicket as if spies were reporting to their commander the progress\r\nmade, and on several occasions the workmen saw dark forms flitting by,\r\nbut at such a pace as to render it impossible to shoot with any accuracy\r\nof aim.\r\n\r\nIt was on the night previous to the day set for the general attack that\r\nthe vessel from Batavia arrived with reinforcements, and then Captain\r\nSeaworth had quite an army under his command.\r\n\r\nHad the colonists been going forth to meet a regularly organized force\r\nof men they could not have proceeded more carefully. The new-comers,\r\nwho were well aware of the fighting qualities of apes, were by no means\r\ndisposed to make light of the intended engagement, but at the same time\r\nno one seemed disposed to shirk his duty.\r\n\r\nDivided into squads of twenty, each man carrying fifty rounds of\r\nammunition, the detachments started from the village, marching through\r\nthe paths and down the roads, and diverging as do the spokes of a wheel\r\nfrom its hub.\r\n\r\nPhilip, who commanded the party which proceeded toward the south, had\r\ntried to induce the chimpanzees to accompany him, believing they could\r\ngive timely warning of the approach of the enemy; but these intelligent\r\nanimals were far too wise to put their precious bodies in such jeopardy.\r\nThey probably understood what the result would be in case of capture,\r\nand all the inducements held out by their master were insufficient to\r\npersuade them even to step over the ship’s rail.\r\n\r\nDuring the first half hour after the forces began to advance, those in\r\nthe village heard no sound. Then came a few scattering shots, followed\r\nby another time of silence, until finally the rattle of regular and\r\nrapid firing from the road down which Philip had passed told the anxious\r\nlisteners that the battle was in progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nA PITCHED BATTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe party commanded by Philip had marched down the broad avenue fully\r\ntwo-thirds of the entire distance from the village to the sea-shore\r\nwithout seeing so much as the tip of an ape’s tail, when suddenly every\r\nman came to a halt without waiting for the word of command as a piercing\r\nscream from the thicket at the left rang out on the clear air.\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily the colonists gazed in the direction from whence the cry\r\nhad come, and as they did so a vast army of apes poured out from the\r\nthicket on the opposite side of the road armed with stones and sticks,\r\nattacking them with such fury that before the men could recover from\r\ntheir bewilderment three had fallen mortally wounded.\r\n\r\nPhilip, who was in the rear of the troops, delayed firing in the hope of\r\nhaving as a target the gigantic form of Goliah.\r\n\r\nIn this, however, he was unsuccessful, for that worthy had taken good\r\ncare to be out of harm’s way, although more than once Philip fancied he\r\nsaw his grinning face. It was but a few seconds, however, that he could\r\nremain inactive, so vigorous and well-directed was the shower of rocks,\r\nand then he discharged his repeating-rifle again and again into the\r\nsolid ranks of apes without producing any apparent effect.\r\n\r\nDuring fifteen minutes this hot engagement continued, and then, as a\r\nshrill cry arose which could be distinctly heard above the rattle of\r\nmusketry, every ape who was left alive vanished amid the thicket in a\r\ntwinkling, leaving the colonists at liberty to count the cost of this\r\nfirst attempt at subduing the original proprietors of the soil.\r\n\r\nFive men were dead, three severely wounded, and hardly one had escaped\r\nwithout some injury. On the other side at least forty apes were left\r\nbehind, either dead or unable to beat a retreat. It was safe to assume\r\nthat as many more had carried away bullets in their bodies; but this\r\nmade the victory a costly one for the colonists, when the number of apes\r\nsupposed to be on the island was taken into consideration.\r\n\r\n“Twenty engagements like this and we shall no longer have men enough to\r\ndefend the village,” Philip said to himself as he gave the order for the\r\ndead and dying to be carried back to the dwellings.\r\n\r\nWhile this portion of Captain Seaworth’s army were returning in funeral\r\nprocession the sounds of conflict could be heard from the extreme\r\nnorthern end of the road, and the reports of the weapons continued\r\nfor about ten minutes, when they died away entirely, causing Philip\r\nto believe the apes had pursued the same tactics as during the first\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The vast army of apes poured from the thicket attacking\r\nthe party with great fury.—(See page 259.)]\r\n\r\nWhen Philip and his decimated party reached the main building of the\r\nsettlement, the squad of men commanded by Mr. Clark, first officer of\r\nthe Reynard, could be seen approaching, bearing ominous-looking burdens,\r\nwhich told that their portion of the conflict had also been attended\r\nwith fatal results. As the remainder of the colonists returned, company\r\nby company, having seen no signs of the enemy, Captain Seaworth called a\r\ncouncil of war, since it was evident that Goliah did not intend to give\r\nbattle again during this day.\r\n\r\nAs nearly as could be judged about a hundred of the apes had been killed,\r\nor so severely wounded as to make their deaths certain; but, on the other\r\nhand, twelve men were dead, and fully twenty so badly disabled as to\r\nrender it impossible for them to take any further part in the defense of\r\nthe settlement for many weeks to come.\r\n\r\n“To continue in this way will simply be to exterminate ourselves,”\r\nCaptain Seaworth said when his officers were assembled. “The apes so far\r\noutnumber us that in less than a week we shall be at the mercy of the\r\nanimals unless some safer plan of attack can be devised; therefore I call\r\nupon you, gentlemen, for an expression of opinion as to what course we\r\nshall pursue.”\r\n\r\nAmong the entire party there was no one who could make a suggestion which\r\nseemed at all feasible. Even Philip was at a loss to know what course\r\ncould be pursued with any chance of ultimate success, and but for the\r\nfact that he was afraid of being called a coward he would then and there\r\nhave advised an abandonment of the scheme of colonizing the island.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the unsatisfactory session had nearly ended that Mr.\r\nClark proposed a plan whereby it might be possible to inflict injury upon\r\nthe apes without suffering any loss of life themselves.\r\n\r\n“Let us bring all the heavy cannon from the ship,” he said, “and place\r\nthem in the dwellings where the openings in the forest can be commanded.\r\nThen for two or three days every person on the island shall remain\r\nconcealed. By the end of that time the apes may fancy we have beat a\r\nretreat and gather around the buildings in such force that we can kill\r\noff a few hundred. It is not a very brilliant suggestion, I must admit;\r\nbut since no one has anything better to offer, it will be only a waste of\r\nseventy-two hours at the most to try the experiment.”\r\n\r\nNo member of the party cared to say that he was really afraid of an army\r\nof apes, although many had greater or less doubt as to whether they\r\nwould ever be able to carry out the original scheme of making there a\r\nplantation, and the first officer’s plan met with the approbation of all.\r\n\r\n“Two parties, numbering fifty each, will proceed at once to the ship for\r\nthe purpose of bringing on shore the heavy guns,” the captain said, as he\r\nadjourned the council, “and after they have been placed in position all\r\nthe women and a portion of the natives must take refuge on the Reynard,\r\nwhile the remainder of our force conceal themselves in the houses.”\r\n\r\nWith this the party separated. Mr. Clark and Philip were detailed to\r\ncommand the respective crews who were to bring up the ordnance, and the\r\nothers, with Captain Seaworth at their head, went to pay the last honors\r\nto those who had fallen in the singular engagement.\r\n\r\nThe ship’s surgeon was the busiest man on the island, and while the dead\r\nwere being suitably interred he, with the women as nurses, established\r\na hospital in the court-yard of Captain Seaworth’s house. The awnings\r\nwere replaced by spare canvas; hammocks were slung on either side, where\r\npatients would be most likely to get the benefit of cooling draughts of\r\nair, and every preparation was made for a long time of enforced seclusion.\r\n\r\nThe four central buildings of the village were selected as the ones to\r\nbe fortified; holes were pierced in the shutters to receive the muzzles\r\nof the cannon, and loop-holes made that the men might be able to train\r\nthe pieces. Powder, grape and canister were brought in large quantities\r\nfrom the ship and stacked up in the rooms, until the buildings intended\r\nfor the peaceful occupancy of industrious colonists looked like the\r\nembrasures of a fort.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day succeeding the battle everything was in readiness\r\nfor the experiment, and fully two-thirds of the colonists were sent on\r\nboard the Reynard, with orders to remain concealed. It was not deemed\r\nadvisable to remove the wounded from the court-yard, for unless the apes\r\nshould begin a regular siege, as they had done when Philip was alone,\r\nthis temporary hospital would not be exposed to an attack.\r\n\r\nCaptain Seaworth, Philip, Mr. Clark and the second mate had charge of the\r\ncannon, and from sunrise on the first day after these arrangements had\r\nbeen completed the four commanders watched carefully and eagerly for the\r\ncoming of the apes, whose curiosity it was hoped would lead them to their\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nAPISH STRATEGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the moment when everything was in readiness for the carrying out of\r\nMr. Clark’s scheme there were no sounds to be heard on the island save\r\nthose caused by the apes or the myriad forms of insect life. It was as\r\nif the colonists had suddenly been stricken dumb; and so careful was\r\nthe captain and his officers to carry out the plan thoroughly that this\r\nsilence was not broken by any one under their command.\r\n\r\nSave for the six ominous-looking protuberances from the shutters,\r\neverything about the village was as it had been when the colonists fled\r\nbefore the pirates, and even human beings might have been deceived by\r\nthis pretended abandonment of the island.\r\n\r\nIt was not expected that the apes would make any demonstration during the\r\nhours of darkness; therefore, with the exception of a sentinel at each\r\nloop-hole, the entire party slept until morning, when certain noises in\r\nthe adjacent forest proclaimed the fact that Goliah’s forces had taken\r\nnote of the unusual silence.\r\n\r\nIt so chanced that Philip was stationed at a point overlooking the\r\nsame portion of the thicket as when he alone defended the building;\r\nand inasmuch as it was directly opposite his station that Goliah had\r\ntaken his stand during both times the settlement had been attacked, the\r\nanimal-trainer naturally hoped the huge baboon would direct the movements\r\nof his followers from the spot he had previously occupied.\r\n\r\nIf the leader could be killed it was but natural to suppose his followers\r\nwould be dispersed, and Philip’s great desire was to put an end to the\r\ncareer of the baboon who had caused him so much suffering.\r\n\r\nTwo hours after sunrise the first decisive move was made by the enemy.\r\nPrevious to this moment they could have been heard chattering among the\r\nthickets; but now a party of about a dozen, who had evidently been sent\r\nforward to spy out the situation of affairs, came boldly from the shelter\r\nof the trees and marched entirely around the settlement.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the concealed party was to wait until the main body of\r\nthe enemy had been massed where a volley of grape-shot could be sent\r\ninto their midst; therefore these spies were allowed to return to their\r\nleaders unmolested.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the third hour another party reconnoitered in much the same\r\nfashion as had the first, save that they went on the verandas of several\r\ncottages, trying the doors and windows, and when they disappeared to make\r\na report Philip understood that the time was near at hand when a salutary\r\nlesson might be given.\r\n\r\nFrom the thicket could be heard a noise as of breaking limbs, shrill\r\ncries of command, and now and then a hoarse shout from Goliah, until\r\nsuddenly fully one-half the main body of apes burst into view from among\r\nthe foliage.\r\n\r\nPhilip looked in vain for Goliah; that wily old baboon had no intention\r\nof exposing his precious person when there were soldiers enough under his\r\ncommand to do the fighting.\r\n\r\nThe guns were already trained, and at the signal, which was the discharge\r\nof a revolver by one of the men stationed near Captain Seaworth, the\r\nsix cannon belched forth their iron hail, mowing great gaps through the\r\nenemy’s lines.\r\n\r\nThere was no opportunity to repeat this dose, for in a twinkling every\r\nanimal who yet had command of his limbs disappeared, and nothing was left\r\nin view of the concealed party save huge piles of dead and wounded.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was not probable the apes would show themselves again, no\r\nsound was made by those in concealment save such as was necessary in\r\nreloading the cannon, and until four o’clock that afternoon all remained\r\non the alert, but without seeing or hearing a single member of Goliah’s\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nThat it was useless to continue the ambush any longer Captain Seaworth\r\nknew perfectly well, and at the word of command the colonists came out\r\nfrom their hiding-places to perform such duties as were absolutely\r\nnecessary in the way of preparing food for themselves and their wounded\r\ncomrades in the court-yard.\r\n\r\nAmong the first work to be done was to bury the slain, for in that\r\ntropical climate the bodies would decompose rapidly, and thus, even after\r\ndeath, be a source of danger to those who had killed them.\r\n\r\nThe number of the fallen was less than had at first been supposed.\r\nOne hundred and twelve were all that could be found, and while it was\r\nreasonable to believe fully as many more had received wounds of which\r\nthey would soon die, the ranks of the enemy had not been decimated to any\r\nappreciable extent.\r\n\r\nThe sun set before the deep trench which had been dug to receive the\r\nbodies was filled, and after this duty had been performed preparations\r\nwere made for the night, since it was possible Goliah might try to avenge\r\nthe blow which had been struck.\r\n\r\nAs the shadows lengthened and the deep gloom settled down over the island\r\ngunners were stationed at the pieces once more, and again the little\r\nvillage was in a state of comparative repose, save directly in the rear,\r\nwhere half a dozen men were bringing water and hewing wood.\r\n\r\nCaptain Seaworth had the same idea as had Philip, that, true to their\r\nimitative habits, the apes, if they made an attack after nightfall,\r\nwould do so at the same point from which their previous efforts had been\r\ndirected, and, therefore, but little attention was given to what might be\r\npassing in the rear.\r\n\r\nThe cooks were preparing a hearty meal, for the men in ambush had not\r\nbeen served with anything warm during two days. The kitchen doors and\r\nwindows were open, and the laborers were pursuing their respective tasks\r\nwithout thought of harm, when suddenly a volley of rocks, coming thickly\r\nas drops of rain in a summer shower, descended upon the unprotected\r\nportion of the main building, taking by most complete surprise even those\r\nwho were on the alert.\r\n\r\nAs these missiles struck the sides and roof of the house or fell through\r\nthe open doors and windows, the noise was so deafening that fully five\r\nminutes elapsed before Captain Seaworth could make his orders understood,\r\nand in that brief time no slight amount of damage had been done.\r\n\r\nThe awning in the court-yard was partially torn down; several of the\r\nwounded men received still further injury; two of the cooks were\r\ndisabled, and the stove was overturned, strewing the coals on the\r\nkitchen floor in such a way as started a blaze among the dry wood, which\r\nthreatened speedy destruction to the house.\r\n\r\nThere was no longer any thought of retaliation, for it was necessary that\r\nthe flames should be extinguished before they gained too much headway,\r\nand the orders were to form lines for passing water.\r\n\r\nHardly had this work been begun when another shower of rocks descended\r\nupon the laborers, driving them in from the spring as several of the\r\nparty fell under the well-directed assault, and during the short time of\r\nconfusion which ensued the fire gained no inconsiderable headway.\r\n\r\nOnly three or four men could work to advantage at bringing water from\r\nthe spring in the court-yard, for the flow was not large enough to permit\r\nof much being carried at a time, and while they were engaged in this\r\nnearly useless labor Captain Seaworth ordered all the others save those\r\nin charge of the cannon to form a cordon around the building for the\r\npurpose of keeping up an incessant discharge of musketry into the thicket.\r\n\r\nNot a single ape could be seen as the men marched bravely to their posts\r\namid the falling missiles, and their volleys, however rapid, had but\r\nlittle effect, owing to the fact that they were forced to fire at random.\r\n\r\nAfter the muskets had been emptied half a dozen times, and the attack had\r\nbeen checked in some slight degree, every third man was told off to fight\r\nthe flames; but so much time had elapsed that before the work was well\r\nbegun it could be plainly seen that all their efforts were vain.\r\n\r\nThen, in order to save the lives of the helpless ones in the court-yard,\r\na still larger number of defenders were assigned the duty of conveying\r\nthe wounded to a building on the outskirts of the settlement, and while\r\nthis was being done it seemed as if every tree in the vicinity concealed\r\nan enemy who kept up a continuous discharge of rocks.\r\n\r\nFor those in charge of the cannon to remain in the house where they could\r\nonly shoot directly in front was useless, and under Philip’s command the\r\nordnance was taken outside. From this point, first in one direction and\r\nthen another, heavy charges of small shot were poured into the thicket\r\nfrom whence came the missiles in the greatest profusion, but evidently\r\nwithout doing much injury to the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe situation was now deplorable. That the main portion of the settlement\r\nwould be consumed there could be no question, for the flames had fastened\r\nupon the wings on either side of the court-yard, and as all the cottages\r\nwere of such an inflammable material it needed but little to complete the\r\nwork of destruction.\r\n\r\nThe glare of the flames threw into brightest relief those who were\r\nstruggling to protect themselves and save the property, and thus they\r\nafforded good targets for the unseen enemy, who had now completely\r\nsurrounded the village.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nTHE RETREAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time the wounded had been removed from the building at least half\r\na dozen more men were in need of the surgeon’s skill, for since the\r\nflames had illuminated the scene so brilliantly the apes were able to\r\naim with more accuracy, and Captain Seaworth soon began to realize that\r\nhis entire force might be killed or disabled if any further attempt at\r\nfighting fire was made.\r\n\r\nPhilip was so deeply engaged in directing the movements of those at the\r\ncannon that he paid no attention to what was taking place outside his\r\nown sphere of action. Knowing perfectly well the manners of the apes,\r\nhe understood that if the volleys of grape should cease even for a few\r\nmoments Goliah’s forces would charge in overwhelming numbers, believing\r\nthe colonists were growing weaker. Therefore, as rapidly as four men\r\ncould clean and load each piece, it was discharged point-blank at that\r\nportion of the thicket in which the enemy appeared to be concealed in\r\ngreatest force.\r\n\r\nThe range was too short to permit of the grape-shot doing as much\r\nexecution as it would have done at five or six times the distance, and\r\nafter seven or eight rounds had been fired Philip discarded the iron\r\nballs entirely, loading the cannon heavily with pebbles and fragments of\r\nrock, which, flying in every direction, would spread over a much larger\r\nspace than round shot.\r\n\r\nIt was while he was most active in this work, and when the two cottages\r\nimmediately adjoining the central dwelling had caught fire, that Captain\r\nSeaworth approached the chief of artillery looking troubled and pale.\r\n\r\n“That a body of men should be routed by apes seems ridiculous,” he said;\r\n“but at this moment I confess I see no chance of success in this unequal\r\nbattle. What is your opinion?”\r\n\r\nPhilip delayed answering only long enough to discharge one cannon at\r\nthe thicket of mimosas south of the burning village, and then, after\r\ndirecting the gunners to clean and reload the piece in the shortest\r\npossible time, he replied, gravely:\r\n\r\n“I am ready to obey your orders, captain, whatever they may be, and\r\nhowever much they vary from my own ideas; but I am convinced that a\r\ncontinuation of this fight will result in the disablement of all your\r\nforces. Already the natives are growing alarmed in the presence of an\r\nunseen enemy who, without fire-arms, can do so much execution, and if\r\nthey should become panic-stricken the white members of the party will be\r\nleft to the mercy of the apes.”\r\n\r\n“Then you propose——”\r\n\r\n“I propose nothing, captain. I have simply given my opinion because you\r\nasked it, and not with any desire to influence your movement.”\r\n\r\nThen Philip rushed forward to another cannon which had been loaded, and\r\nafter discharging it returned to Captain Seaworth, who said:\r\n\r\n“I am convinced you are correct. With the limited amount of water at our\r\ncommand it will be impossible to stay the progress of the flames, and\r\nwe must leave the village to its destruction. Withdraw your guns one by\r\none after I have sent the wounded to the ship. It will be necessary for\r\nyou to cover the retreat with the cannon, because we have so many in the\r\nhospital that nearly the entire working-force are required to transport\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“Then it is to be a retreat?”\r\n\r\n“If we were fighting against men I should feel warranted in a complete\r\nsurrender to prevent further slaughter; but since that is impossible it\r\nmust be as you say—a retreat. I will send those who are fighting the\r\nflames to assist you in the more rapid discharge of the cannon while we\r\nare carrying the wounded to the ship. Messengers must be dispatched to\r\nMr. Clark, with instructions for him to forward all aboard the Reynard to\r\naid us on the way.”\r\n\r\nPhilip wasted no time in reply. He realized fully how important it was\r\nthat a more vigorous defense should be made just at this moment, and he\r\nurged the men to renewed exertions, if indeed that was possible when\r\nevery one battled for life itself.\r\n\r\nThen began what has probably never had an equal in warfare—the retreat of\r\na large body of armed men before a party of apes.\r\n\r\nAs Captain Seaworth had said, it required the greater portion of his\r\nforce to convey the wounded, and so few remained to work the heavy guns,\r\ndrawing them back a few paces toward the sea-coast after each discharge,\r\nthat the commander himself was forced to assist Philip.\r\n\r\nIt was fully a quarter of an hour before the last wounded man left the\r\nbuilding which had been converted into a temporary hospital, and then,\r\nfoot by foot, the little party of artillerists literally fought their way\r\nbackward, while the rapid discharge of fire-arms from those in advance\r\ntold that the apes had already circled around the retreating army. As a\r\ncannon was discharged it would be drawn twenty or thirty paces to the\r\nrear, the men reloading even while it was moving, and the showers of\r\nstones came thicker and more frequent.\r\n\r\nBefore half the necessary distance was traversed Philip’s left shoulder\r\nhad been so severely cut with a fragment of rock as to render the arm\r\nuseless, while blood streamed down the captain’s face from many minor\r\nwounds. Hardly a man among those who were protecting the rear was\r\nuninjured, and just when Philip began to fear that what had commenced as\r\nan orderly march would end in a complete rout, reinforcements from the\r\nships arrived.\r\n\r\nThis party of thirty fresh men, each with a plentiful supply of\r\nammunition, checked the closely-pursuing apes, and it became possible to\r\nmove the cannon forty or fifty yards after each discharge.\r\n\r\nFinally, to the intense relief of all, the beach was gained, and here it\r\nwas necessary to form in regular line of battle while the wounded were\r\nbeing conveyed to the ships in small boats.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if the apes understood that this was their last opportunity,\r\nfor they immediately redoubled their efforts. But now, however, being\r\nso near a place of safety, the men fought even more courageously than\r\nbefore, and huge sheets of flame burst from the weapons as the missiles\r\nwent hurtling through the branches, causing great slaughter, as could be\r\ntold by the shrieks of the wounded and dying animals.\r\n\r\nThen the cannon were abandoned on the sea-shore when the boats from both\r\nvessels were drawn up ready to receive the defenders at the same moment,\r\nand, still discharging their muskets rapidly, the men were at last\r\nconveyed to a place of comparative safety.\r\n\r\nThe deck of the Reynard looked not unlike that of a line-of-battle\r\nship after a terrific naval engagement. Hammocks were slung in every\r\ndirection; improvised cots were placed fore and aft; and the surgeon,\r\nwith all the women, was fully occupied in dressing the wounds until the\r\nsun once more sent down his pitiless glare over the island and the sea.\r\n\r\nLooking shoreward, along the road Philip had caused to be made while he\r\nwas king of the apes, nothing could be seen of the picturesque little\r\nvillage save a heap of blackened, smoking ruins. The flames had done\r\ntheir work thoroughly, and not a single building remained standing. That\r\nthe scheme of colonizing the island must be abandoned for the time being,\r\nat least, Philip understood, since even if Goliah and his forces could\r\nhave been exterminated immediately a return to the United States was\r\nnecessary in order to replenish the stores, as well as to provide new\r\nbuildings for the laborers.\r\n\r\nWhen the wounded had been made as comfortable as was possible under the\r\ncircumstances, Philip thought for the first time of the two chimpanzees,\r\nand not seeing them anywhere around, he feared, through some mischance,\r\nthey had gone ashore in one of the boats, in which case their doom was\r\ncertainly sealed.\r\n\r\nIn this, however, he was mistaken. Half an hour later, while assisting\r\nthe crew to rig up temporary berths in the hold, he found the two animals\r\ncowering in the forward portion of the ship, behind some spare cables,\r\nand it was many moments before he could induce either to come on deck.\r\n\r\nToward noon, when the intense heat rendered it almost impossible for\r\nthe crew to continue the work of converting the ship into a temporary\r\nhospital, Captain Seaworth held another consultation, and this time it\r\nhad no reference to how the apes might be exterminated, but was simply a\r\nquestion of when it would be possible to set sail.\r\n\r\nThere were yet a sufficient number of men to work the ships as far as\r\nBatavia, unless they were attacked by the pirates; and after deciding\r\nthat it would be better to run the chances of a fight at sea than be\r\ncaught at anchor by the Malays, Captain Seaworth reported the fact of\r\nPhilip’s having found a vast amount of treasure in the subterranean\r\nchambers.\r\n\r\nNever yet did blood outweigh gold, and every member of the council was\r\neager to become possessed of the precious metal, even at the risk of\r\nanother encounter with the animals. There was but little discussion\r\nnecessary in order to arrive at the opinion of the majority, which was\r\nthat they should defer sailing until at least one journey could be made\r\nto the grotto, and a certain amount of the wealth be brought away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nA DISAPPOINTMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach hour increased the anxiety of Captain Seaworth and his officers.\r\nThere was every reason to believe the pirates would return, and perhaps\r\nvery soon. It was not the custom of Malays to acknowledge themselves\r\nvanquished so quickly, and doubtless they had the fullest information\r\nconcerning the movements of the colonists from the numberless small proas\r\nor sampans which can be met in any direction under the guise of honest\r\ntraders.\r\n\r\nNow that the colonists had returned, it was to be expected the pirates\r\nwould avenge themselves for the injuries inflicted by the Reynard, and\r\nit was more than probable these reprisals would be made at the earliest\r\npossible moment. As Mr. Clark suggested:\r\n\r\n“This time there will be no warning given. The weapon we found serves to\r\nnotify any of their friends we may have with us to be on the alert, and\r\nwhen the scoundrels come again it will be with the utmost secrecy.”\r\n\r\nThe ship which brought the natives from Batavia must also be taken back,\r\nand there were hardly more than sufficient able-bodied men left after\r\nthe battle to work both crafts into port. If, therefore, the pirates\r\nshould attack while the vessels were at anchor, it would be possible to\r\nmake only the slightest show of defense. The Malays could easily finish\r\nthat which Goliah had begun, and the massacre would be complete.\r\n\r\n“Since we have decided to visit the cave,” Captain Seaworth said, as\r\nthe council of war was brought to a close, “I believe it should be done\r\nwithout loss of time. The apes have received such a punishment as will\r\nprobably prevent them from renewing hostilities until after they have\r\nrecovered somewhat from the effects of the battle, and the journey can be\r\nmade more safely to-morrow morning than twelve hours later.”\r\n\r\n“You might also continue, captain, by saying that it would be safer to go\r\nnow than wait eighteen hours,” Mr. Clark said.\r\n\r\nInstead of replying, Captain Seaworth looked at Philip questioningly, and\r\nthe latter said, after a brief time of thought:\r\n\r\n“I am of the opinion that the attempt should be made at once. We can\r\nreturn by sunset, and it will then be possible to take advantage of the\r\nnight-breeze to get under way.”\r\n\r\nThere was no necessity for any further discussion, and preparations for\r\nthe journey were begun without delay.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course it was necessary to leave behind as many of the\r\nable-bodied men as would be sufficient to work the boats, because it was\r\nunsafe to moor the little crafts where the apes might destroy or set\r\nthem adrift, and after the crew had been told off for this purpose there\r\nwere but twenty-two uninjured ones to go in search of the treasure.\r\n\r\nFew as these were in number, they made a formidable host because of their\r\nweapons. Each carried a repeating-rifle, two revolvers, and a cutlass,\r\nwith ammunition enough to continue a spirited engagement for at least an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was not more than half spent when the little party was\r\nconveyed from the ship to the shore, and, forming in a column of fours,\r\nmarched up the southern avenue to the ruins of the village, each man on\r\nthe alert for the slightest suspicious sound which should betoken the\r\ncoming of the enemy.\r\n\r\nDuring the march they took note of one singular fact—the absence of any\r\ndead or wounded apes.\r\n\r\nIt was in this avenue that they had seen scores of the enemy fall before\r\nthe discharge of the cannon, and it was not probable they had killed\r\nless than a hundred. On the foliage were stains of blood, and the broken\r\nsurface of the road showed where the soil had absorbed the life-blood of\r\nmany a human being as well as animal; but there were no other traces of\r\nthe fray. Several times did Captain Seaworth and Philip leave the ranks\r\nto penetrate a short distance among the underbrush, but without gaining\r\nany information as to the disposition of the dead.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the ruins of the village it was found deserted, like the\r\navenue, and the treasure-seekers continued on their way to the grotto.\r\n\r\nThis last portion of the journey was supposed to be the most dangerous,\r\nand yet they reached the mouth of the cavern without having been molested.\r\n\r\nThe work of carrying away the treasure which had seemed so dangerous\r\nnow appeared to be a very simple task, and Philip, followed by his\r\ncompanions, marched boldly into the grotto without a thought of danger,\r\nwhen suddenly a shower of stones came from the tunnel with such effect\r\nthat three of the party were stricken down.\r\n\r\nNaturally the first thought of the men was to return the fire; but on\r\nraising their weapons there were no adversaries to be seen. As Philip\r\nand the chimpanzees had barricaded the passage, so now had Goliah, and a\r\nnarrow slit at the top of the wall through which the volley of stones had\r\nbeen sent was the only aperture visible.\r\n\r\nTo aim at this opening would simply be a waste of ammunition, since\r\nthe bullets could only strike the top of the tunnel, and this Philip\r\nunderstood in a very few seconds.\r\n\r\nThere was no necessity, however, for him to advise the beating of a\r\nretreat. Each man in turn, on finding himself confronted by a shower of\r\nstones when no enemy was visible, took refuge outside the grotto, some\r\nof the more thoughtful carrying the wounded with them; and here the\r\ngold-hunters took counsel together.\r\n\r\n“We can now understand why there were no wounded to be seen,” Captain\r\nSeaworth said. “The big baboon has profited by Mr. Garland’s example\r\nand fortified himself in this place, where he has most likely set up a\r\nhospital. The question now is, Can we dislodge him with the force at our\r\ncommand?”\r\n\r\n“To that question I say, most emphatically, No,” Philip replied. “The\r\npassage is so long, the amount of rock in the chambers so great, that a\r\nthousand men would hardly be sufficient to vanquish the apes while they\r\nremain in a position which is almost impregnable.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean that we cannot recover the treasure?” Mr. Clark asked in\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n“You can answer that as well as I,” was Philip’s reply. “The tunnel is\r\nnot less than forty feet long, and through it but two men can pass at a\r\ntime. At the further end we may safely say there are not less than five\r\nhundred apes, who can procure plenty of their peculiar ammunition by\r\noverturning the stalactites; and from your experience in monkey warfare\r\ndo you fancy, now our party is reduced to nineteen, that we can effect an\r\nentrance?”\r\n\r\n“It may be that only a few of the baboon’s followers have taken refuge\r\nhere,” Mr. Clark suggested; and the captain replied, quickly:\r\n\r\n“There can be little doubt but that they are all within the chamber,\r\notherwise we should most certainly have been attacked while coming up the\r\nroad. Mr. Garland has described the structure of this place so well that\r\nwe can fully understand the condition of affairs, and I see no possible\r\nchance of recovering the treasure until the apes have retreated.”\r\n\r\n“Which is the same as saying that we must abandon all hope of getting it,\r\nsince it would be hardly less than madness to remain here in view of the\r\nfact that the pirates may return at any moment,” Mr. Clark added.\r\n\r\n“Exactly so, gentlemen but at the same time I leave it to you to say\r\nwhether we shall go, or remain in the faint hope of being able to\r\ndislodge the baboon army.”\r\n\r\nHowever eager the party might be to gain possession of the vast treasure\r\nwhich they knew to be in the cavern, all were forced to confess that\r\nunder present circumstances it was impossible to obtain it, and with one\r\naccord the march to the sea was taken up.\r\n\r\nAlready had the night-wind begun to blow. The ships were rising and\r\nfalling on the swelling sea, tugging at their cables as if impatient to\r\nbe away, while far on the horizon toward the south could be seen, by the\r\nnaked eye, a tiny smudge of black which betokened the coming of some\r\ncraft, for no land lay within the range of vision in that direction.\r\n\r\n“Ahoy on the Reynard!” Captain Seaworth shouted, and in the absence of\r\nany officer the surgeon answered the hail.\r\n\r\n“Have the lookouts reported a sail in the vicinity?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay, sir. A fleet of proas coming from the southward. Most likely the\r\npirates whom we met before.”\r\n\r\nThis was sufficient to settle the question of treasure-seeking, if that\r\nwhich had been seen at the grotto was not convincing; and although Goliah\r\nhad wrought so much destruction, to him they were now probably indebted\r\nfor their lives, since, if it had been possible to enter the subterranean\r\nchamber, they would have remained several hours, in which time the Malays\r\ncould have approached so near as to render flight impossible.\r\n\r\nIn less than thirty minutes both ships were under way, every sail set\r\nand drawing, and before the island of apes had faded in the distance the\r\npirate fleet was lost to view.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of colonizing the island was a failure. It had cost the lives\r\nof many, the limbs of not a few, and all the property brought from New\r\nYork, while absolutely nothing had been accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe port of Batavia was made without incident, and, after only so long\r\na stay as was necessary to settle up certain business matters connected\r\nwith the corporation, the Reynard set sail for the home port.\r\n\r\nTo-day Philip Garland is in New York, and with him are the two\r\nchimpanzees; but whether he ever returns to the island, of which he\r\nwas once king, in search of the vast treasure known to be there, is a\r\nquestion he only can answer, and at the present time he has not decided.\r\n\r\n\r\n[THE END.]",
