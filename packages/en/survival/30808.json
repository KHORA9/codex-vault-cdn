Doughty, General Editors\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF FARMING\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAND AND THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\nFrom the most southern point of Ontario on Lake Erie, near the 42nd\r\nparallel of latitude, to Moose Factory on James Bay, the distance is\r\nabout 750 miles. From the eastern boundary on the Ottawa and St Lawrence\r\nRivers to Kenora at the Manitoba boundary, the distance is about 1000\r\nmiles. The area lying within these extremes is about 220,000 square\r\nmiles. In 1912 a northern addition of over 100,000 square miles was made\r\nto the surface area of the province, but it is doubtful whether the\r\nagricultural lands will thereby be increased. Of this large area about\r\n25,000,000 acres are occupied and assessed, including farm lands and\r\ntown and city sites. It will be seen, therefore, that only a small\r\nfraction of the province has, as yet, been occupied. Practically all the\r\noccupied area lies south of a line drawn through Montreal, Ottawa, and\r\nSault Ste Marie, and it forms part of the great productive zone of the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nThe next point to be noted is the irregularity of the boundary-line, the\r\ngreater portion of which is water--Lakes Superior, Huron, Erie, Ontario,\r\nthe St Lawrence River, the Ottawa River, James Bay, and Hudson Bay. The\r\nmodifying effect of great bodies of water must be considered in studying\r\nthe agricultural possibilities of Ontario.\r\n\r\nAcross this great area of irregular outline there passes a branch of\r\nthe Archæan rocks running in a north-western direction and forming a\r\nwatershed, which turns some of the streams to Hudson Bay and the others\r\nto the St Lawrence system. An undulating surface has resulted, more or\r\nless filled with lakes, and almost lavishly supplied with streams, which\r\nare of prime importance for agricultural life and of incalculable value\r\nfor commercial purposes. To these old rocks which form the backbone of\r\nthe province may be traced the origin of the large stretches of rich\r\nsoil with which the province abounds.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the map, and even a limited knowledge of the\r\ngeological history of the province, will lead to the conclusion that in\r\nOntario there must be a wide range in the nature and composition of the\r\nsoils and a great variety in the climatic conditions. These conditions\r\nexist, and they result in a varied natural production. In the extreme\r\nsouth-western section plants of a semi-tropical nature were to be found\r\nin the early days in luxurious growth; while in the extreme north,\r\nspruce, somewhat stunted in size and toughened in fibre, are still to be\r\nfound in vast forests.\r\n\r\nIt is with the southern section, that lying south of the Laurentian\r\nrocks, that our story is mainly concerned, for the occupation and\r\nexploitation of the northland is a matter only of recent date. Nature\r\nprovided conditions for a diversified agriculture. It is to such a land\r\nthat for over a hundred years people of different nationalities, with\r\ntheir varied trainings and inclinations, have been coming to make their\r\nhomes. We may expect, therefore, to find a great diversity in the\r\nagricultural growth of various sections, due partly to the variety of\r\nnatural conditions and partly to the varied agricultural training of the\r\nsettlers in their homelands.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY SETTLEMENT, 1783-1816\r\n\r\nOriginally this province was covered with forest, varied and extensive,\r\nand was valued only for its game. The hunter and trapper was the\r\npioneer. To protect and assist him, fortified posts were constructed at\r\ncommanding points along the great waterways. In the immediate vicinity\r\nof these posts agriculture, crude in its nature and restricted in its\r\narea, had its beginning.\r\n\r\nIt was into this wooded wilderness that the United Empire Loyalists,\r\nnumbering in all approximately ten thousand people, came in the latter\r\npart of the eighteenth century.[1] They were a people of varied\r\norigins--Highland Scottish, German, Dutch, Irish Palatine, French\r\nHuguenot, English. Most of them had lived on farms in New York State,\r\nand therefore brought with them some knowledge and experience that stood\r\nthem in good stead in their arduous work of making new homes in a land\r\nthat was heavily wooded. In the year 1783 prospectors were sent into\r\nWestern Quebec, the region lying west of the Ottawa River, and\r\nselections were made for them in four districts--along the St Lawrence,\r\nopposite Fort Oswegatchie; around the Bay of Quinte, above Fort\r\nCataraqui; in the Niagara peninsula, opposite Fort Niagara; and in the\r\nsouth-western section, within reach of Fort Detroit. Two reasons\r\ndetermined these locations; first, the necessity of being located on the\r\nwater-front, as lake and river were the only highways available; and,\r\nsecondly, the advisability of being within the protection of a fortified\r\npost. The dependence of the settlers upon the military will be realized\r\nwhen we remember that they had neither implements nor seed grain. In\r\nfact, they were dependent at first upon the government stores for their\r\nfood. It is difficult at the present time to realize the hardships and\r\nappreciate the conditions under which these United Empire Loyalist\r\nsettlers began life in the forest of 1784.\r\n\r\nHaving been assigned their lots and supplied with a few implements, they\r\nbegan their work of making small clearings and the erection of rude\r\nlog-houses and barns. Among the stumps they sowed the small quantities\r\nof wheat, oats, and potatoes that were furnished from the government\r\nstores. Cattle were for many years few in number, and the settler, to\r\nsupply his family with food and clothing, was compelled to add hunting\r\nand trapping to his occupation of felling the trees.\r\n\r\nGradually the clearings became larger and the area sown increased in\r\nsize. The trails were improved and took on the semblance of roads, but\r\nthe waterways continued to be the principal avenues of communication. In\r\neach of the four districts the government erected mills to grind the\r\ngrain for the settlers. These were known as the King's Mills.\r\nWater-power mills were located near Kingston, at Gananoque, at Napanee,\r\nand on the Niagara River. The mill on the Detroit was run by wind power.\r\nAn important event in the early years was when the head of the family\r\nset out for the mill with his bag of wheat on his back or in his canoe,\r\nand returned in two or three days, perhaps in a week, with a small\r\nsupply of flour. In the early days there was no wheat for export. The\r\nquestion then may be asked, was there anything to market? Yes; as the\r\ndevelopment went on, the settlers found a market for two surplus\r\nproducts, timber and potash. The larger pine trees were hewn into timber\r\nand floated down the streams to some convenient point where they were\r\ncollected into rafts, which were taken down the St Lawrence to Montreal\r\nand Quebec. Black salt or crude potash was obtained by concentrating the\r\nashes that resulted from burning the brush and trees that were not\r\nsuitable for timber.\r\n\r\nFor the first thirty years of the new settlements the chief concern of\r\nthe people was the clearing of their land, the increasing of their field\r\ncrops, and the improving of their homes and furnishings. It was slow\r\ngoing, and had it not been for government assistance, progress, and even\r\nmaintenance of life, would have been impossible. That was the heroic age\r\nof Upper Canada, the period of foundation-laying in the province.\r\nFarming was the main occupation, and men, women, and children shared the\r\nburdens in the forest, in the field, and in the home. Roads were few and\r\npoorly built, except the three great military roads planned by\r\nLieutenant-Governor Simcoe running east, west, and north from the town\r\nof York. Social intercourse was of a limited nature. Here and there a\r\nschool was formed when a competent teacher could be secured. Church\r\nservices were held once a month, on which occasions the missionary\r\npreacher rode into the district on horseback. Perhaps once or twice in\r\nthe summer the weary postman, with his pack on his back, arrived at the\r\nisolated farmhouse to leave a letter, on which heavy toll had to be\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\nProgress was slow in those days, but after thirty years fair hope of an\r\nagricultural country was beginning to dawn upon the people when the War\r\nof 1812 broke out. By this time the population of the province had\r\nincreased to about eighty thousand. During this first thirty years very\r\nlittle had been done in the way of stimulating public interest in\r\nagricultural work. Conditions were not favourable to organization. The\r\n'town meeting' was concerned mainly with the question of the height of\r\nfences and regulations as to stock running at large. One attempt,\r\nhowever, was made which should be noted. Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe took\r\ncharge of affairs early in 1792, and, immediately after the close of the\r\nfirst session of the legislature at Newark (Niagara) in the autumn of\r\nthat year, organized an agricultural society at the headquarters which\r\nmet occasionally to discuss agricultural questions. There are no records\r\nto show whether social intercourse or practical agricultural matters\r\nformed the main business. The struggle for existence was too exacting\r\nand the conditions were not yet favourable for organization to advance\r\ngeneral agricultural matters.\r\n\r\nWhen the War of 1812 broke out the clearings of the original settlers\r\nhad been extended, and some of the loyalists still lived, grown grey\r\nwith time and hardened by the rough life of the backwoods. Their sons,\r\nmany of whom had faint recollection of their early homes across the\r\nline, had grown up in an atmosphere of strictest loyalty to the British\r\ncrown, and had put in long years in clearing the farms on which they\r\nlived and adding such comforts to their houses, that to them, perhaps as\r\nto no other generation, their homes meant everything in life. The\r\nsummons came to help to defend those homes and their province. For three\r\nyears the agricultural growth received a severe check. Fathers and sons\r\ntook their turn in going to the front. The cultivation of the fields,\r\nthe sowing and the harvesting of the crops, fell largely to the lot of\r\nthe mothers and the daughters left at home. But they were equal to it.\r\nIn those days the women were trained to help in the work of the fields.\r\nThey did men's work willingly and well. In many cases they had to\r\ncontinue their heroic work after the close of the war, until their\r\nsurviving boys were grown to years of manhood, for many husbands and\r\nsons went to the front never to return.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] See 'Pioneer Settlements' in this section.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PERIOD OF EXPANSION, 1816-46\r\n\r\nThe close of the war saw a province that had been checked at a time of\r\nvigorous growth now more or less impoverished, and, in some sections,\r\ndevastated. This was, however, but the gloomy outlook before a period of\r\nrapid expansion. In 1816, on the close of the Napoleonic wars in Europe,\r\nlarge numbers of troops were disbanded, and for these new homes and new\r\noccupations had to be found. Then began the first emigration from\r\nBritain overseas to Upper Canada. All over the British Isles little\r\ngroups were forming of old soldiers reunited to their families. A few\r\nhousehold furnishings were packed, a supply of provisions laid in, a\r\nsailing vessel chartered, and the trek began across the Atlantic. The\r\nemigrants sailed from many ports of England, Scotland, and Ireland.\r\nSometimes the trip was made in three or four weeks; but often, through\r\ncontrary winds or rough weather, three or four months passed before the\r\nvessel sailed up the St Lawrence and landed the newcomers at Montreal.\r\nHardly half of their difficulties were then overcome or half of their\r\ndangers passed. If they were to find their new locations by land, they\r\nmust walk or travel by slow ox-cart; if they journeyed by water, they\r\nmust make their way up the St Lawrence by open boat, surmounting the\r\nmany rapids in succession, poling the boats, pulling against the stream,\r\nat times helping to carry heavy loads over the portages. Their new homes\r\nin the backwoods were in townships in the rear of those settled by the\r\nloyalists, or in unoccupied areas lying on the lake-fronts between the\r\nfour districts referred to as having been taken up by the loyalists.\r\nThen began the settlements along the north shore of Lake Ontario and of\r\nLake Erie, and the population moved forward steadily. In 1816 the total\r\npopulation of the province was approximately 100,000; by 1826, according\r\nto returns made to the government, it had increased to 166,000; in 1836\r\nit was 374,000, and in 1841 it was 456,000. The great majority of these\r\npeople, of course, lived upon the land, the towns being comparatively\r\nsmall, and the villages were composed largely of people engaged in\r\nagricultural work.\r\n\r\nThis peaceful British invasion contributed a new element to the\r\nprovince and added still further to the variety of the people. In one\r\ntownship could be found a group of English settlers, most of whom came\r\nfrom a southern county of England, near by a township peopled by\r\nScottish Lowlanders, and not far away a colony of north of Ireland\r\nfarmers, or perhaps a settlement composed entirely of people from the\r\nvicinity of Cork or Limerick.\r\n\r\nThese British settlers brought new lines of life, new plans for houses\r\nand barns, new methods of cultivation, new varieties of seed, and, what\r\nwas perhaps of most influence upon the agricultural life of the\r\nprovince, new kinds of live stock. Even to this day can be seen traces\r\nof the differences in construction of buildings introduced by the\r\ndifferent nationalities that came as pioneers into the various sections\r\nof the province--the French Canadian constructed his buildings with\r\nlong, steep roofs; the Englishman followed his home plan of many small,\r\nlow outbuildings with doors somewhat rounded at the top; the German and\r\nDutch settler built big barns with their capacious mows. These latter\r\nhave become the type now generally followed, the main improvement in\r\nlater years being the raising of the frames upon stone foundations so as\r\nto provide accommodation for live stock in the basement. It would be\r\ninteresting and profitable to study carefully the different localities\r\nto determine what elements have contributed to the peculiar agricultural\r\ncharacteristics of the present day. In this connection the language also\r\nmight be investigated. For instance, to the early Dutch farmers of Upper\r\nCanada we owe such common words as 'stoop,' 'bush,' 'boss,' 'span.' To\r\nthe early British settler these were foreign words. When the oversea\r\nsettlers came up the St Lawrence they were transported from Montreal\r\neither by 'bateau' or by 'Durham boat.'[2]\r\n\r\nSpecial reference must be made to the live stock introduced by the\r\nBritish settlers. This was one of the most important elements in the\r\nexpansion and permanent development of the agriculture of the province.\r\nThe British Isles have long been noted for their pure-bred stock. In no\r\nother part of the world have so many varieties been originated and\r\nimproved. In horses, there are the Clydesdale, the Shire, the\r\nThoroughbred, and the Hackney; in cattle, Shorthorns, Herefords,\r\nAyrshires, Devon, and the dairy breeds of Jersey and Guernsey; in sheep,\r\nSouthdowns, Shropshires, Leicesters; in swine, Berkshires and\r\nYorkshires. Many other breeds might be added to these. Poultry and dogs\r\nalso might be referred to. The Britisher has been noted for his love of\r\nlive stock. He has been trained to their care, his agricultural methods\r\nhave been ordered to provide food suitable for their wants, and he has\r\nbeen careful to observe the lines of breeding so as to improve their\r\nquality. In the earliest period of the settlement of the province live\r\nstock was not numerous and the quality was not of the best. Whatever was\r\nto be found on the farms came mainly from the United States and was of\r\ninferior type. The means of bringing in horses, cattle, and sheep were\r\nlimited. The result was that field work at that time was largely done by\r\nhand labour. Hunting and fishing helped to supply the table with the\r\nfood that to-day we obtain from the butcher. When the Britisher came\r\nacross the Atlantic he brought to Upper Canada his love for live stock\r\nand his knowledge how to breed and care for the same. The result was\r\nseen in the rapid increase in the number of horses, cattle, sheep, and\r\nswine, and the placing of the agriculture of the province on a firm\r\nbasis for future growth.\r\n\r\nBy 1830 the population had grown to about 213,000, practically all\r\nlocated on the land. In that year there were only five towns of 1000 or\r\nover: namely, Kingston, 3587; York (Toronto), 2860; London, (including\r\nthe township), 2415; Hamilton (including the township), 2013; and\r\nBrockville, 1130. The returns to the government show that of the\r\n4,018,385 acres occupied 773,727 were under cultivation. On the farms\r\nwere to be found 30,776 horses, 33,517 oxen, 80,892 milch cows, and\r\n32,537 young cattle. It is interesting to note that oxen, so useful in\r\nclearing land and in doing heavy work, were more numerous than horses.\r\nOxen were hardier than horses; they could forage for themselves and live\r\non rough food, and when disabled could be converted into food. They thus\r\nplayed a very important part in the pioneer life. There were no improved\r\nfarm implements in those days: the plough, the spade, the hoe, the fork,\r\nthe sickle, the hook, the cradle, and the rake--implements that had been\r\nthe husbandman's equipment for centuries--completed the list. With these\r\nthe farmer cultivated his lands and gathered his crops. With two stout\r\nhickory poles, joined together at the end with tough leather thongs, a\r\nflail was made with which he threshed out his grain on the floor of his\r\nbarn.\r\n\r\nThe earliest pioneers raised some flax, and from the fibre made coarse\r\nlinen fabrics, supplementing these by skins of wild animals and the\r\nhides of cattle. With the introduction of sheep by the British settlers\r\nwool became an important product, and homespun garments provided\r\nadditional clothing for all the members of the family. Seeds of various\r\nfruit trees were planted, and by 1830 the products of these seedlings\r\nsupplemented the wild plums and cherries of the woods and the wild\r\nraspberries that sprang up in abundance in the clearings and slashes. By\r\nthis time every farm had one or more milch cows and the farmer's table\r\nwas supplied with fresh milk, butter, and home-made cheese. As the first\r\nhalf-century of the province was drawing to its close, some of the\r\ncomforts of home life began to be realized by the farming community. The\r\nisolation of the former period disappeared as roads of communication\r\nwere opened up and extended.\r\n\r\nHere and there societies were formed for the exhibition of the products\r\nof the farm and for friendly competitions. So important were these\r\nsocieties becoming in the life of the whole community that in 1830 the\r\ngovernment gave them recognition and provided an annual grant to assist\r\nthem in their work. This is an important event in agricultural history,\r\nfor it marks the beginning of government assistance to the agricultural\r\nindustry. Between 1820 and 1830 probably not more than half a dozen\r\nagricultural societies were organized. Some records of such were\r\npreserved at York, Kingston, and in the Newcastle district. From the\r\nrecord of the County of Northumberland Agricultural Society it is\r\nlearned that its first show was held in the public square of the village\r\nof Colborne on October 19, 1828, when premiums were awarded amounting in\r\nall to seventy-seven dollars. There were fourteen prizes for live stock,\r\ntwo prizes for cheese, two for field rollers, and two for essays on the\r\nculture of wheat. The first prize essay, for which the winner received\r\nfive dollars, was printed for distribution. The prize list was limited\r\nin range, but it shows how this new settlement, formed largely by\r\nBritish settlers since 1816, was giving particular attention to the\r\nencouragement of live stock. A short quotation from the prize essay as\r\nto the best method of clearing the land for wheat should be found of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n      As a great part of our County is yet in a wilderness state\r\n      and quite a share of the wheat brought to our markets is\r\n      reared on new land, I deem it important that our\r\n      enterprising young men who are clearing away the forest\r\n      should know how to profit by their hard labor. Let the\r\n      underwood be cut in the autumn before the leaves fall, and\r\n      the large timber in the winter or early in the spring. This\r\n      will insure a good burn, which is the first thing requisite\r\n      for a good crop. Do your logging in the month of June, and\r\n      if you wish to make money, do it before you burn your brush\r\n      and save the ashes; these will more than half pay you for\r\n      clearing the land: and by burning at this season you will\r\n      attract a drove of cattle about you that will destroy all\r\n      sprouts which may be growing; do not leave more than four\r\n      trees on an acre and girdle these in the full moon of March\r\n      and they will never leaf again; thus you may have your land\r\n      prepared for the seed before harvest.\r\n\r\nThe act of 1830 provided a grant of £100 for a society in each district,\r\nupon condition that the members subscribed and paid in at least £50, and\r\nin the case of a society being organized in each county the amount was\r\nto be equally divided among the societies. The condition of making the\r\ngrant was set forth in the act as follows: 'When any Agricultural\r\nSociety, for the purpose of importing valuable live stock, grain, grass\r\nseeds, useful implements or whatever else might conduce to the\r\nimprovement of agriculture in this Province,' etc.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this substantial assistance by the government,\r\nagricultural societies increased in number, and their influence, in\r\nassisting in the improvement of the live stock and the bringing of new\r\nimplements to the attention of farmers, was most marked.\r\n\r\nHorses, sheep and milch cows increased rapidly. Purebred cattle now\r\nbegan to receive some attention. The first record of importation is the\r\nbringing of a Shorthorn bull and a cow from New York State in 1831 by\r\nRobert Arnold of St Catharines. In 1833 Rowland Wingfield, an Englishman\r\nfarming near Guelph, brought a small herd of choice animals across the\r\nocean, landed them at Montreal, took them to Hamilton by way of the\r\nOttawa River, the Rideau Canal, and Lake Ontario, and then drove them on\r\nfoot to Wellington County. The Hon. Adam Fergusson of Woodhill followed\r\ntwo or three years later with a similar importation.\r\n\r\nThe first Ayrshire cattle can be traced back to the Scottish settlers\r\nwho arrived during this period. These emigrants had provided their own\r\nfood for the voyage to Canada, and in some cases brought a good milch\r\ncow to provide fresh milk on the voyage. She would be disposed of on\r\nlanding, at Montreal or in the eastern part of Upper Canada. This\r\naccounts for the early predominance of Ayrshires in Eastern Ontario.\r\nThus to the period 1830-45 belongs the first foundation of the pure-bred\r\nstock industry.\r\n\r\nIt was in this period also that the first signs appear of improved farm\r\nimplements and labour-saving machinery. Ploughs of improved pattern,\r\nlighter and more effective, were being made. Land rollers and harrows\r\nmade in the factory began to take the place of the home-made articles.\r\nCrude threshing machines, clover-seed cleaners, root-cutters, and a\r\nsimple but heavy form of hay-rake came into use. The mowing machine and\r\nthe reaper were making their appearance in Great Britain and the United\r\nStates, but they had not yet reached Upper Canada.\r\n\r\nThe organization of agricultural societies in the various districts,\r\nand the great impetus given to the keeping of good stock, led in 1843 to\r\nthe suggestion that a provincial organization would be of benefit to the\r\nfarming industry. In the neighbouring State of New York a similar\r\norganization had been in existence since 1832 and successful State fairs\r\nhad been held, which some of the more prominent farmers of Upper Canada\r\nhad visited. An agricultural paper called the _British American\r\nCultivator_ had been established in York, and through this paper, in\r\nletters and editorials, the idea of a provincial association was\r\nadvocated. For three years the discussion proceeded, until finally, in\r\n1846, there was organized the Provincial Agricultural Association and\r\nBoard of Agriculture for Canada West, composed of delegates from the\r\nvarious district societies. The result was that the first provincial\r\nexhibition was held in Toronto on October 21 and 22 of that year. The\r\nold Government House at the south-western corner of King Street and\r\nSimcoe Street, then empty, was used for the exhibits, and the stock and\r\nimplements were displayed in the adjoining grounds. The Canada Company\r\ngave a contribution of $200, eight local societies made donations, about\r\n$280 was secured as gate money, and 297 members paid subscriptions.\r\nPremiums were paid to the amount of $880, the bulk of which went to live\r\nstock; books, which cost about $270, were given as prizes; and there was\r\nleft a cash balance on hand of $400. A ploughing match was held, and on\r\nthe evening of the first day a grand banquet was given, attended by the\r\nofficers and directors and by some of the leading citizens of Toronto.\r\nAmong the speakers at this banquet were Chief Justice Robinson and\r\nEgerton Ryerson, superintendent of education.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] See 'Shipping and Canals' in section v. pp. 489-90.\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIZED AGRICULTURE, 1846-67\r\n\r\nThe organization of this provincial association fittingly introduces\r\nanother era in agricultural growth. It is to be noted that this\r\nprovincial organization was a self-created body; it drew at first no\r\ngovernment funds direct. It commended itself to the people, for on July\r\n28, 1847, the provincial parliament in session at Montreal passed an act\r\nincorporating it under the name of the Agricultural Association of Upper\r\nCanada, and in the charter named as members a number of the leading\r\ncitizens of the province. It was governed by a board of directors, two\r\nof whom were chosen annually by each district agricultural society. The\r\nobjects set forth were the improvement of farm stock and produce, the\r\nimprovement of agricultural implements, and the encouragement of\r\ndomestic manufactures, of useful inventions applicable to agricultural\r\nor domestic purposes, and of every branch of rural and domestic economy.\r\nOut of this provincial association came all the further agricultural\r\norganizations of a provincial nature, and ultimately, some forty years\r\nlater, the Ontario department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe second provincial exhibition was held at Hamilton in 1847, and Lord\r\nElgin, the governor-general, was in attendance. He was also a generous\r\npatron, for his name appears as a donor of $100. The address which he\r\ndelivered at the banquet has been preserved in the published records and\r\nis copiously marked with cheers and loud applause.\r\n\r\nThe third exhibition was held at Cobourg in 1848. The official report of\r\nthe exhibits indicates that pure-bred stock was rapidly increasing and\r\nimproving in quality; but the most significant paragraph is that dealing\r\nwith implements, and this is well worth quoting in full.\r\n\r\n      Of implements of Canada make, the Show was deficient; and\r\n      we were much indebted to our American neighbours for their\r\n      valuable aid on this occasion. A large number of ploughs,\r\n      straw-cutters, drills, cornshellers, churns, etc., etc.,\r\n      were brought over by Messrs Briggs & Co. of Rochester, Mr\r\n      Emery of Albany, and a large manufacturing firm near\r\n      Boston. Mr Bell of Toronto exhibited his excellent plough,\r\n      straw-cutter, and reaping machine. The first prize for the\r\n      latter article was awarded to Mr Helm of Cobourg for the\r\n      recent improvements which he has effected. Mr Clark of\r\n      Paris exhibited his one-horse thrashing-mill, which\r\n      attracted much attention.\r\n\r\nAt the fourth exhibition, held at Kingston in 1849, the show of\r\nimplements was much more extensive, and comment was made on the\r\nimprovement of articles of home manufacture. At this meeting Professor\r\nJ. F. W. Johnson, of Edinburgh, who was making a tour of North America,\r\nwas present. The address of the president, Henry Ruttan of Cobourg, is a\r\nmost valuable reference article descriptive of the agricultural progress\r\nof the province from the first settlements in 1783 to the time of the\r\nexhibition. Ruttan was a loyalist's son, and, from his own personal\r\nknowledge, he described the old plough that was given by the government\r\nto each of the first settlers.\r\n\r\n      It consisted of a small iron socket, whose point entered by\r\n      means of a dove-tailed aperture into the heel of the\r\n      coulter, which formed the principal part of the plough, and\r\n      was in shape similar to the letter L, the shank of which\r\n      went through the wooden beam, and the foot formed the point\r\n      which was sharpened for operation. One handle and a plank\r\n      split from the side of a winding block of timber, which did\r\n      duty for the mould-board, completed the implement. Besides\r\n      provisions for a year, I think each family had issued to\r\n      them a plough-share and coulter, a set of dragg-teeth, a\r\n      log chain, an axe, a saw, a hammer, a bill hook and a\r\n      grubbing hoe, a pair of hand-irons and a cross-cut saw\r\n      amongst several families, and a few other articles.\r\n\r\nHe then refers to the large number of implements then being pressed upon\r\nthe farmers, until 'they have almost become a nuisance to the farmer who\r\ndesires to purchase a really useful article.' All of which indicates\r\nthat a distinctive feature of the period beginning with 1846 was the\r\nintroduction and rapid extension of improved farm machinery.\r\n\r\nA few words as to the reaping machine, which contributed more than any\r\nother modern implement to the development of agriculture in the past\r\ncentury, may not be out of place. Various attempts had been made at\r\nproducing a machine to supersede the sickle, the scythe, and the cradle\r\nbefore the Rev. Patrick Bell, in 1826, presented his machine to the\r\nHighland Agricultural Society of Scotland for its examination. Bell's\r\nmachine was fairly successful, and one was then in operation on the farm\r\nof his brother, Inch-Michael, in the Carse of Gowrie. One set of knives\r\nwas fixed, another set worked above and across these like the blades of\r\na pair of scissors. The grain fell on an endless cloth which carried and\r\ndeposited the heads at the side of the machine. A horse pushed it\r\nforward and kept all parts in motion. It was simple, and, we are told,\r\nharvested twelve acres in a day. This was in 1826. In the _New York\r\nFarmer and American Gardener's Magazine_ for 1834 may be found the\r\ndescriptions and illustrations of Obed Hussey's grain-cutter and Cyrus\r\nH. McCormick's 'improved reaping-machine.' The question has been raised\r\nas to whether either of these United States inventions owed anything to\r\nthe earlier production of Patrick Bell. It was, of course, the improved\r\nUnited States reaping machines that found their way into Upper Canada\r\nshortly after the organization of the Provincial Agricultural\r\nAssociation. Our interest in this matter is quickened by the fact that\r\nthe Rev. Patrick Bell, when a young man, was for some time a tutor in\r\nthe family of a well-to-do farmer in the county of Wellington, and there\r\nis a tradition that while there he carried on some experiments in the\r\norigination of his machine. The suggestion of a 'mysterious visitor'\r\nfrom the United States to the place where he was experimenting is\r\nprobably mere conjecture.\r\n\r\nThis period, 1846 to 1867, was one of rapid growth in population. The\r\nfree-grant land policy of the government was a great attraction for tens\r\nof thousands of people in the British Isles, who were impelled by social\r\nunrest, failure of crops, and general stagnation in the manufacturing\r\nindustries to seek new homes across the sea. In the twenty years\r\nreferred to the population more than doubled, and the improved lands of\r\nthe province increased fourfold. The numbers of cattle and sheep about\r\ndoubled, and the wheat production increased about threefold.\r\n\r\nTowards the latter part of the period a new agricultural industry came\r\ninto existence--the manufacture of cheese in factories. It was in New\r\nYork State that the idea of co-operation in the manufacture of cheese\r\nwas first attempted. There, as in Canada West, it had been the practice\r\nto make at home from time to time a quantity of soft cheese, which, of\r\ncourse, would be of variable quality. To save labour, a proposition was\r\nmade to collect the milk from several farms and have the cheese made at\r\none central farm. The success of this method soon became known and small\r\nfactories were established. In 1863 Harvey Farrington came from New York\r\nState to Canada West and established a factory in the county of Oxford,\r\nabout the same time that a similar factory was established in the county\r\nof Missisquoi, Quebec. Shortly afterwards factories were built in\r\nHastings County, and near Brockville, in Leeds County. Thus began an\r\nindustry that had a slow advance for some fifteen years, but from 1880\r\nspread rapidly, until the manufacture of cheese in factories became one\r\nof the leading provincial industries. The system followed is a slight\r\nmodification of the Cheddar system, which takes its name from one of the\r\nmost beautiful vales in the west of England. Its rapid progress has been\r\ndue to the following circumstances: Ontario, with her rich grasses,\r\nclear skies, and clean springs and streams, is well adapted to dairying;\r\nlarge numbers of her farmers came from dairy districts in the mother\r\ncountry; the co-operative method of manufacture tends to produce a\r\nmarketable article that can be shipped and that improves with proper\r\nstorage; Great Britain has proved a fine market for such an article; and\r\nthe industry has for over thirty years received the special help and\r\ncareful supervision and direction of the provincial and Dominion\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\nDuring this period we note the voluntary organization of the Ontario\r\nFruit-Growers' Association, a fact which alone would suggest that the\r\nproduction of fruit must have been making progress. The early French\r\nsettlers along the Detroit River had planted pear trees or grown them\r\nfrom seed, and a few of these sturdy, stalwart trees, over a century\r\nold, still stand and bear some fruit. Mrs Simcoe, in her _Journal_, July\r\n2, 1793, states: 'We have thirty large May Duke cherry trees behind the\r\nhouse and three standard peach trees which supplied us last Autumn for\r\ntarts and desserts during six weeks, besides the numbers the young men\r\neat.' This was at Niagara. The records of the agricultural exhibitions\r\nindicate that there was a gradual extension of fruit-growing.\r\nImportations of new varieties were made, Rochester, in New York State,\r\napparently being the chief place from which nursery stock was obtained.\r\nHere and there through the province gentlemen having some leisure and\r\nthe skill to experiment were beginning to take an interest in their\r\ngardens and to produce new varieties. On January 19, 1859, a few persons\r\nmet in the board-room of the Mechanics' Hall at Hamilton and organized a\r\nfruit-growers' association for Upper Canada. Judge Campbell was elected\r\npresident; Dr Hurlbert, first vice-president; George Leslie, second\r\nvice-president; Arthur Harvey, secretary. The members of this\r\nassociation introduced new varieties and reported on their success. They\r\nwere particularly active in producing such new varieties as were\r\npeculiarly suitable to the climate. For nine years they maintained their\r\norganization and carried on their work unaided and unrecognized\r\nofficially.\r\n\r\nTo this period belongs also the first attempts at special instruction in\r\nagriculture and the beginning of an agricultural press. Both are\r\nintimately connected with the association, already referred to, that had\r\nbeen organized in 1846 by some of the most progressive citizens.\r\n\r\nFor four years the Provincial Association carried on its work and\r\nestablished itself as a part of the agricultural life of Canada West. In\r\n1850 the government stepped in and established a board of agriculture as\r\nthe executive of the association. Its objects were set out by statute\r\nand funds were to be provided for its maintenance. The new lines of work\r\nallotted to it were to collect agricultural statistics, prepare crop\r\nreports, gather information of general value and to present the same to\r\nthe legislature for publication, and to co-operate with the provincial\r\nuniversity in the teaching of agriculture and the carrying on of an\r\nexperimental or illustrative farm. Professor George Buckland was\r\nappointed to the chair of agriculture in the university in January 1851\r\nand an experimental farm on a small scale was laid out on the university\r\ngrounds. Professor Buckland acted also as secretary to the board until\r\n1858, when he resigned and was succeeded by Hugh C. Thomson. He\r\ncontinued his work for some years at the university, and was an active\r\nparticipant in all agricultural matters up to the time of his death in\r\n1885.\r\n\r\nProvision having been made for agricultural instruction at the\r\nuniversity, the board in 1859 decided to establish a course in\r\nveterinary science, and at once got into communication with Professor\r\nDick of the Veterinary College at Edinburgh, Scotland. In 1862 a school\r\nwas opened in Toronto under the direction of Professor Andrew Smith,\r\nrecently arrived from Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nThe _British American Cultivator_ was established in 1841 by Eastwood\r\nand Co. and W. G. Edmundson, with the latter as editor. It gave place in\r\n1849 to the _Canadian Agriculturist_, a monthly journal edited and owned\r\nby George Buckland and William McDougall. This was the official organ of\r\nthe board till the year 1864, when George Brown began the publication of\r\nthe _Canada Farmer_ with the Rev. W. F. Clark as editor-in-chief and D.\r\nW. Beadle as horticultural editor. The board at once recognized it,\r\naccepted it as their representative, and the _Canadian Agriculturist_\r\nceased publication in December 1863.\r\n\r\nThe half-century of British immigration, 1816 to 1867, had wrought a\r\nwonderful change. From a little over a hundred thousand the population\r\nhad grown to a million and a half; towns and cities had sprung into\r\nexistence; commercial enterprises had taken shape; the construction of\r\nrailways had been undertaken; trade had developed along new lines; the\r\nstandards of living had materially changed; and great questions,\r\nnational and international, had stirred the people and aroused at times\r\nthe bitterest political strife. The changed standards of living can best\r\nbe illustrated by an extract from an address delivered in 1849 by\r\nSheriff Ruttan. Referring to the earlier period, he said:\r\n\r\n      Our food was coarse but wholesome. With the exception of\r\n      three or four pounds of green tea a year for a family,\r\n      which cost us three bushels of wheat per pound, we raised\r\n      everything we ate. We manufactured our own clothes and\r\n      purchased nothing except now and then a black silk\r\n      handkerchief or some trifling article of foreign\r\n      manufacture of the kind. We lived simply, yet\r\n      comfortably--envied no one, for no one was better off than\r\n      his neighbour. Until within the last thirty years, one\r\n      hundred bushels of wheat, at 2s. 6d. per bushel, was quite\r\n      sufficient to give in exchange for all the articles of\r\n      foreign manufacture consumed by a large family.... The\r\n      old-fashioned home-made cloth has given way to the fine\r\n      broadcloth coat; the linsey-woolsey dresses of females have\r\n      disappeared and English and French silks been substituted;\r\n      the nice clean-scoured floors of the farmers' houses have\r\n      been covered by Brussels carpets; the spinning wheel and\r\n      loom have been superseded by the piano; and in short, a\r\n      complete revolution in all our domestic habits and manners\r\n      has taken place--the consequences of which are the\r\n      accumulation of an enormous debt upon our shoulders and its\r\n      natural concomitant, political strife.\r\n\r\nStudents of Canadian history will at once recall the story of the\r\nRebellion of 1837, the struggle for constitutional government, the\r\ninvestigation by Lord Durham, the repeal of the preferential wheat\r\nduties in England, the agitation for Canadian independence, and other\r\ngreat questions that so seriously disturbed the peace of the Canadian\r\npeople. They were the 'growing pains' of a progressive people. The\r\nCrimean War, in 1854-56, gave an important though temporary boom to\r\nCanadian farm products. Reciprocity with the United States from 1855 to\r\n1866 offered a profitable market that had been closed for many years.\r\nThen came the close of the great civil war in the United States and the\r\nopening up of the cheap, fertile prairie lands of the Middle West to the\r\nhundreds of thousands of farmers set free from military service. This\r\nwestward movement was joined by many farmers from Ontario; there was a\r\ndisastrous competition in products, and an era of agricultural\r\ndepression set in just before Confederation. It was because of these\r\ndifficulties that Confederation became a possibility and a necessity.\r\nThe new political era introduced a new agricultural period, which began\r\nunder conditions that were perhaps as unfavourable and as unpromising as\r\nhad been experienced for over half a century.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GROWTH OF SCIENTIFIC FARMING, 1867-88\r\n\r\nThe period that we shall now deal with begins with Confederation in\r\n1867 and extends to 1888, when a provincial minister of Agriculture was\r\nappointed for the first time and an independent department organized.\r\n\r\nFrom 1792 to 1841 what is now Ontario was known as Upper Canada; from\r\n1841 to 1867 it was part of the United Province of Canada, being known\r\nas Canada West to distinguish it from Quebec or Canada East. In 1867,\r\nhowever, it resumed its former status as a separate province, but with\r\nthe new name of Ontario. In the formation of the government of the\r\nprovince agriculture was placed under the care of a commissioner, who,\r\nhowever, held another portfolio in the cabinet. John Carling was\r\nappointed commissioner of Public Works and also commissioner of\r\nAgriculture. On taking office Carling found the following agricultural\r\norganizations of the province ready to co-operate with the government:\r\nsixty-three district agricultural societies, each having one or more\r\nbranch township societies under its care, and all receiving annual\r\ngovernment grants of slightly over $50,000; a provincial board of\r\nagriculture, with its educational and exhibition work; and a\r\nfruit-growers' association, now for the first time taken under\r\ngovernment direction and given financial assistance.\r\n\r\nOne extract from the commissioner's first report will serve to show the\r\ncondition of agriculture in Ontario when the Dominion was born. 'It is\r\nan encouraging fact that during the last year in particular mowers and\r\nreapers and labour-saving implements have not only increased in the\r\nolder districts, but have found their way into new ones, and into places\r\nwhere they were before practically unknown. This beneficial result has,\r\nno doubt, mainly arisen from the difficulty, or rather in some cases\r\nimpossibility, of getting labour at any price.' It would appear,\r\ntherefore, that the question of shortage of farm labour, so much\r\ncomplained of in recent years, has been a live one for forty years and\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nIn the second report of the commissioner (1869) special attention was\r\ndirected to the question of agricultural education, and the suggestion\r\nwas made that the agricultural department of the university and the\r\nveterinary college might give some instruction to the teachers at the\r\nnormal school. In the following year, however, an advanced step was\r\ntaken. It was noted that Dr Ryerson was in sympathy with special\r\nagricultural teaching and had himself prepared and published a text-book\r\non agriculture. The suggestion was made that the time had arrived for a\r\nschool of practical science. At the same time Ryerson had appointed the\r\nRev. W. F. Clark, the editor of the _Canada Farmer_, to visit the\r\nAgricultural department at Washington and a few of the agricultural\r\ncolleges of the United States, and to collect such practical information\r\nas would aid in commencing something of an analogous character in\r\nOntario. It will thus be seen that the two branches of technical\r\ntraining--the School of Practical Science and the Agricultural\r\nCollege--were really twin institutions, originating, in the year 1870,\r\nin the dual department of Public Works and Agriculture. These\r\ninstitutions were the outcome of the correlation of city and country\r\nindustries, which were under the fostering care of the Agriculture and\r\nArts Association, as the old provincial organization was now known. The\r\nSchool of Practical Science, it may be noted, is now incorporated with\r\nthe provincial university, and the Agricultural College is affiliated\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nThere were at that time two outstanding agricultural colleges in the\r\nUnited States, that of Massachusetts and that of Michigan. These were\r\nvisited, and, based upon the work done at these institutions, a\r\ncomprehensive and suggestive report was compiled. Immediate action was\r\ntaken upon the recommendations of this report, and a tract of land, six\r\nhundred acres in extent, was purchased at Mimico, seven miles west of\r\nToronto. Before work could be commenced, however, the life of the\r\nlegislature closed and a new government came into office in 1871 with\r\nArchibald McKellar as commissioner of Agriculture and Arts. New\r\ngovernments feel called upon to promote new measures. There were rumours\r\nand suggestions that the soil of the Mimico farm was productive of\r\nthistles and better adapted to brick-making than to the raising of\r\ncrops. Also the location was so close to Toronto that it was feared that\r\nthe attractions of the city would tend to make the students discontented\r\nwith country life. For various reasons a change of location was deemed\r\ndesirable, and a committee of farmer members of the legislature was\r\nappointed. Professor Miles, of the Michigan Agricultural College, was\r\nengaged to give expert advice; other locations were examined, and\r\nfinally Moreton Lodge Farm, near Guelph, was purchased. After some\r\npreliminary difficulties, involving the assistance of a sheriff or\r\nbailiff, possession was obtained, and the first class for instruction in\r\nagricultural science and practice, consisting of thirty-one pupils in\r\nall, was opened on June 1, 1874, with William Johnston as rector or\r\nprincipal. Thus was established the Ontario School of Agriculture, now\r\nknown as the Ontario Agricultural College. Its annual enrolment has\r\ngrown to over fifteen hundred, and it is now recognized as the\r\nbest-equipped and most successful institution of its kind in the British\r\nEmpire. Its development along practical lines and its recognition as a\r\npotent factor in provincial growth were largely due to Dr James Mills,\r\nwho was appointed president of the college in 1879, and filled that\r\nposition until January 1904, when he was appointed to the Dominion Board\r\nof Railway Commissioners. Under his direction farmers' institutes were\r\nestablished in Ontario in 1884. Dr Mills was succeeded by Dr G. C.\r\nCreelman as president.\r\n\r\nThe next important step in agricultural advancement was the appointment\r\nin 1880 of the Ontario Agricultural Commission 'to inquire into the\r\nagricultural resources of the Province of Ontario, the progress and\r\ncondition of agriculture therein and matters connected therewith.' The\r\ncommission consisted of S. C. Wood, then commissioner of Agriculture\r\n(chairman), Alfred H. Dymond (secretary), and sixteen other persons\r\nrepresentative of the various agricultural interests, including the\r\npresident and ex-president of the Agricultural and Arts Association,\r\nProfessor William Brown of the Agricultural College, the master of the\r\nDominion Grange, the president of the Entomological Society, and two\r\nmembers of the legislature, Thomas Ballantyne and John Dryden. In 1913\r\nthere were but two survivors of this important commission, J. B.\r\nAylesworth of Newburgh, Ont., and Dr William Saunders, who, after over\r\ntwenty years' service as director of the Dominion Experimental Farms,\r\nhad resigned office in 1911.\r\n\r\nAll parts of the province were visited and information was gathered\r\nfrom the leading farmers along the lines laid down in the royal\r\ncommission. In 1881 the report was issued in five volumes. It was\r\nwithout doubt the most valuable commission report ever issued in\r\nOntario, if not in all Canada. Part of it was reissued a second and a\r\nthird time, and for years it formed the Ontario farmer's library. Even\r\nto this day it is a valuable work of reference, containing as it does a\r\nvast amount of practical information and forming an invaluable source of\r\nagricultural history.\r\n\r\nThe first outcome of this report was the establishment, in 1882, by the\r\ngovernment of the Ontario bureau of Industries, an organization for the\r\ncollection and publication of statistics in connection with agriculture\r\nand allied industries. Archibald Blue, who now occupies the position of\r\nchief officer of the census and statistics branch of the Dominion\r\nservice, was appointed the first secretary of the bureau.\r\n\r\nAgriculture continued to expand, and associations for the protection and\r\nencouragement of special lines increased in number and in importance.\r\nThus there were no fewer than three vigorous associations interested in\r\ndairying: the Dairymen's Association of Eastern Ontario, and the\r\nDairymen's Association of Western Ontario, which were particularly\r\ninterested in the cheese industry, and the Ontario Creameries\r\nAssociation, which was interested in butter manufacture. There were\r\npoultry associations, a beekeepers' association, and several live stock\r\nassociations. From time to time the suggestion was made that the work of\r\nthese associations, and that of the Agriculture and Arts Association and\r\nof the bureau of Industries, should be co-ordinated, and a strong\r\ndepartment of Agriculture organized under a minister of Agriculture\r\nholding a distinct portfolio in the Ontario cabinet. Provision for this\r\nwas made by the legislature in 1888, and in that year Charles Drury was\r\nappointed the first minister of Agriculture. The bureau of Industries\r\nwas taken as the nucleus of the department, and Archibald Blue, the\r\nsecretary, was appointed deputy minister.\r\n\r\nWe have referred to the reaction that took place in Ontario agriculture\r\nafter the close of the American Civil War and the abrogation of the\r\nreciprocity treaty. The high prices of the Crimean War period had long\r\nsince disappeared, the market to the south had been narrowed, and the\r\nWestern States were pouring into the East the cheap grain products of a\r\nrich virgin soil. Agricultural depression hung over the province for\r\nyears. Gradually, however, through the early eighties the farmers began\r\nto recover their former prosperous condition, sending increasing\r\nshipments of barley, sheep, horses, eggs, and other commodities to the\r\ncities of the Eastern States, so that at the close of the period to\r\nwhich we are referring agricultural conditions were of a favourable and\r\nprosperous nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MODERN PERIOD, 1888-1912\r\n\r\nIn 1888 a new period in Ontario's agricultural history begins. The\r\nworking forces of agriculture were being linked together in the new\r\ndepartment of Agriculture. Charles Drury, the first minister of\r\nAgriculture, held office until 1890, being succeeded by John Dryden, who\r\ncontinued in charge of the department until 1905, when a conservative\r\ngovernment took the place of the liberal government that had been in\r\npower since 1871.\r\n\r\nTwo factors immediately began to play a most important part in the\r\nagricultural situation: the opening up of the north-western lands by the\r\ncompletion of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1886, and the enactment,\r\non October 6, 1890, of the McKinley high tariff by the United States.\r\nThe former attracted Ontario's surplus population, and made it no longer\r\nprofitable or desirable to grow wheat in the province for export; the\r\nlatter closed the doors to the export of barley, live stock, butter, and\r\neggs. The situation was desperate; agriculture was passing through a\r\nperiod of most trying experience. Any other industry than that of\r\nagriculture would have been bankrupted. The only hope of the Ontario\r\nfarmer now was in the British market. The sales of one Ontario product,\r\nfactory cheese, had been steadily increasing in the great consuming\r\ndistricts of England and Scotland, and there was reason to believe that\r\nother products might be sold to equal advantage. Dairying was the one\r\nline of agricultural work that helped to tide over the situation in the\r\nearly nineties. The methods that had succeeded in building up the cheese\r\nindustry must be applied to other lines, and all the organized forces\r\nmust be co-ordinated in carrying this out. This was work for a\r\ndepartment of Agriculture, and the minister of Agriculture, John Dryden,\r\nwho guided and directed this co-operation of forces and made plans for\r\nthe future growth and expansion of agricultural work, was an imperialist\r\nindeed who, in days of depression and difficulty, directed forces and\r\ndevised plans that not only helped the agricultural classes to recover\r\ntheir prosperity, but also made for the strengthening of imperial ties\r\nand the working out of national greatness.\r\n\r\nThe British market presented new conditions, new demands. The\r\nNorth-West could send her raw products in the shape of wheat; Ontario\r\nmust send finished products--beef, bacon, cheese, butter, fruit, eggs,\r\nand poultry--these and similar products could be marketed in large\r\nquantities if only they could be supplied of right quality.\r\nTransportation of the right kind was a prime necessity. Lumber, wheat,\r\nand other rough products could be handled without difficulty, but\r\nperishable goods demanded special accommodation. This was a matter\r\nbelonging to the government of Canada, and to it the Dominion department\r\nof Agriculture at once began to give attention. The production of the\r\ngoods for shipment was a matter for provincial direction. Gradually the\r\nfarmers of the province adapted themselves to the new conditions and\r\nafter a time recovered their lost ground. General prosperity came in\r\nsight again about 1895. For several years after this the output of beef,\r\nbacon, and cheese increased steadily, and the gains made in the British\r\nmarket more than offset the loss of the United States market. It was\r\nduring the five years after 1890 that the farmers suffered so severely\r\nwhile adjusting their work to the new conditions. With these expanding\r\nlines of British trade products, the values of stock, implements, and\r\nbuildings made steady advance, and in 1901 the total value of all farm\r\nproperty in the province crossed the billion dollar mark. Since that\r\nyear the annual increase in total farm values has been approximately\r\nforty million dollars. The following statement of total farm values in\r\nOntario, as compiled by the Ontario bureau of Industries, the\r\nstatistical branch of the department of Agriculture, is very suggestive:\r\n\r\n_Total Farm Values_\r\n\r\n  1885     $958,159,740\r\n  1886      989,497,911\r\n  1887      975,292,214\r\n  1888      981,368,094\r\n  1889      982,210,664\r\n  1890      970,927,035\r\n  1891      971,886,068\r\n  1892      979,977,244\r\n  1893      970,361,070\r\n  1894      954,395,507\r\n  1895      931,989,574\r\n  1896      910,291,623\r\n  1897      905,093,613\r\n  1898      923,022,420\r\n  1899      947,513,360\r\n  1900      974,814,931\r\n  1901    1,001,323,296\r\n  1902    1,044,894,332\r\n  1906    1,189,119,120\r\n  1909    1,241,019,109\r\n\r\nFrom the above table it will be seen that the closing of the United\r\nStates markets in 1890 was followed by a depreciation in general farm\r\nvalues which lasted until 1898, when the upward movement that has\r\ncontinued ever since set in.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us see how the population was changing, as to its\r\ndistribution between rural and urban, during these years. First, we\r\nshall give the assessed population.\r\n\r\n                    Rural               Urban\r\n  1884            1,117,880            636,187\r\n  1885            1,126,554            658,406\r\n  1890            1,117,533            800,041\r\n  1895            1,109,013            848,377\r\n  1900            1,094,246            919,614\r\n  1905            1,059,379          1,042,881\r\n  1909            1,049,240          1,240,198\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway opened up the wheat lands of the West in\r\n1886. At that time the rural population was nearly double the urban; in\r\n1905 they were about equal; and six years later the urban population of\r\nOntario exceeded the rural.\r\n\r\nThe Dominion census figures are as follows:\r\n\r\n                    Rural              Urban\r\n  1911            1,194,785          1,328,489\r\n  1901            1,246,969            935,978\r\n                  ---------          ---------\r\n    Increase          ....             392,511\r\n    Decrease         52,184              ....\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that during the past twenty-five years there has\r\nbeen a steady increase in the consumers of food products in Ontario and\r\na slight decrease in the producers of the same. The surplus population\r\nof the farms has gone to the towns and cities of Ontario and to the\r\nwestern provinces. Now for a moment let us follow these people to the\r\nWest. Many of them have gone on the land to produce wheat. Wheat for the\r\nEuropean market has been their principal product, therefore they in turn\r\nhave become consumers of large quantities of food that they do not\r\nthemselves produce but must obtain from farmers elsewhere. But not all\r\nwho have gone West have become farmers. The Dominion census of 1911\r\ngives the following statement of population for the provinces and\r\ndistricts west of Lake Superior:\r\n\r\n                    Rural               Urban\r\n  1911            1,059,681            681,216\r\n  1901              446,050            199,467\r\n                  ---------            -------\r\n    Increase        613,631            481,749\r\n\r\nThe western provinces are generally considered to be almost purely\r\nagricultural, and yet the percentage increase of urban population has\r\nbeen nearly double the percentage increase of rural population. And this\r\nrapidly growing urban population also has demanded food products. Their\r\nown farmers grow wheat and oats and barley. British Columbia produces\r\nfruit for her own people and some surplus for the prairie provinces.\r\nThere is some stock-raising, but the rapid extension of wheat areas has\r\ninterfered with the great stock ranches. From out of the Great West,\r\ntherefore, there has come an increasing demand for many food products.\r\nAdd to this the growing home market in Ontario, and, keeping in mind\r\nthat the West can grow wheat more cheaply than Ontario, it will be\r\nunderstood why of recent years the Ontario farmer has been compelled to\r\ngive up the production of wheat for export. His line of successful and\r\nprofitable work has been in producing to supply the demands of his own\r\ngrowing home market, and the demands of the rapidly increasing people of\r\nthe West, both rural and urban, and also to share in the insatiable\r\nmarket of Great Britain. Another element of more recent origin has been\r\nthe small but very profitable market of Northern Ontario, where\r\nlumbering, mining, and railroad construction have been so active in the\r\npast five or six years.\r\n\r\nThe result of all this has been a great increase in fruit production.\r\nOld orchards have been revived and new orchards have been set out. The\r\nextension of the canning industry also is most noticeable, and has\r\noccasioned the production of fruits and vegetables in enormous\r\nquantities. Special crops such as tobacco, beans, and sugar beets are\r\nbeing grown in counties where soil and climatic conditions are\r\nfavourable. The production of poultry and eggs is also receiving more\r\nattention each succeeding year. The growth of cities is creating an\r\nincreasing demand for milk, and the production of factory-made butter\r\nand cheese is also increasing, as the following figures for Ontario from\r\nthe Dominion census prove:\r\n\r\n                     Butter               Cheese\r\n  1900            7,559,542 lb.      131,967,612 lb.\r\n  1910           13,699,153  \"       157,631,883  \"\r\n\r\nFor the past ten or twelve years the farmers of Ontario have been\r\nslowly adjusting their work to the new situation, and the transition is\r\ncontinuing. While in some sections farms are being enlarged so as to\r\npermit the more extensive use of labour-saving machinery and the more\r\neconomical handling of live stock, in other sections, particularly in\r\ncounties adjacent to the Great Lakes, large farms are being cut up into\r\nsmaller holdings and intensive production of fruits and vegetables is\r\nnow the practice. This, of course, results in a steady increase in land\r\nvalues and is followed by an increase in rural population. The farmers\r\nof Ontario are putting forth every effort to meet the demands for food\r\nproducts. The one great difficulty that they have encountered has been\r\nthe scarcity of farm labour. Men have come from Europe by the tens of\r\nthousands, but they have been drawn largely to the growing towns and\r\ncities by the high wages offered in industrial lines; and the West, the\r\n'Golden West' as it is sometimes called, has proved an even stronger\r\nattraction. It seems rarely to occur to the new arrival that the average\r\nfarm in Ontario could produce more than a quarter section of prairie\r\nland. Signs, however, point to an increase in rural population, through\r\nthe spread of intensive agriculture.\r\n\r\nBefore referring to the methods of instruction and assistance provided\r\nfor the developing of this new agriculture in Ontario, reference should\r\nbe made to one thing that is generally overlooked by those who\r\nperiodically discover this rapid urban increase, and who moralize most\r\ngloomily upon a movement that is to be found in nearly every progressive\r\ncountry of the civilized world. In the days of early settlement the\r\nfarmer and his family supplied nearly all their own wants. The farmer\r\nproduced all his own food; he killed his own stock, salted his pork, and\r\nsmoked his hams. His wife was expert in spinning and weaving, and\r\nplaited the straw hats for the family. The journeyman shoemaker dropped\r\nin and fitted out the family with boots. The great city industries were\r\nthen unknown. The farmer's wife in those days was perhaps the most\r\nexpert master of trades ever known. She could spin and weave, make a\r\ncarpet or a rug, dye yarns and clothes, and make a straw hat or a birch\r\nbroom. Butter, cheese, and maple sugar were products of her skill, as\r\nwell as bread, soap, canned fruits, and home-made wine. In those days\r\nthe farm was a miniature factory or combination of factories. Many, in\r\nfact most, of these industries have gradually moved out of the farm home\r\nand have been concentrated in great factories; and the pedlar with his\r\npack has disappeared under a shower of catalogues from the departmental\r\ncity store. In other words, a large portion of work once done upon the\r\nfarm and at the country cross-roads has been transferred to the town and\r\ncity, and this, in some part, explains the modern movement citywards--\r\nthere has been a transference from country to city not only of people\r\nbut also of industries. Whether this has been in the interests of the\r\npeople is another question, but the process is still going on, and what\r\nfurther changes may take place it is difficult to determine and unwise\r\nto forecast.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us see what agencies and organizations have been used in the\r\ndevelopment of the special lines of agriculture since the creation of\r\nthe department in 1888. We have stated that the Agriculture and Arts\r\nAssociation had been for many years the directing force in provincial\r\nagricultural organization. It held an annual provincial exhibition; it\r\nissued the diplomas to the graduates of the Ontario Veterinary College;\r\nand it controlled the various live stock associations that were\r\ninterested in the registration of stock. Shortly after 1888 legislation\r\nwas enacted transferring the work to the department of Agriculture. The\r\nplace for holding the provincial exhibition was changed from year to\r\nyear. In 1879 a charter was obtained by special act for the Toronto\r\nIndustrial Exhibition, the basis of which was the Toronto Electoral\r\nAgricultural Society. Out of this came the annual Toronto Exhibition,\r\nnow known as the Canadian National Exhibition, and the governmental\r\nexhibition was discontinued.\r\n\r\nThe Ontario Veterinary College was a privately owned institution,\r\nthough the diplomas were issued by the Agriculture and Arts Association.\r\nThe royal commission appointed in 1905 to investigate the University of\r\nToronto recommended the taking over of this association by the\r\ngovernment, and as a result it passed under the control of the\r\ndepartment of Agriculture in 1908, and was affiliated with the\r\nUniversity of Toronto. Since that time the diploma of Veterinary Surgeon\r\n(V.S.) has been issued by the minister of Agriculture, and a\r\nsupplementary degree of Bachelor of Veterinary Science (B.V.Sc.) has\r\nbeen granted by the university. The taking over of this institution by\r\nthe government, the resuming by the province of its original\r\nprerogative, was accompanied by an enlargement of the course, an\r\nextension from two years to three years in the period of instruction,\r\nand a strengthening of the faculty. The herd-books or pedigree record\r\nbooks were, in most cases, Canadian, and it was felt that they should be\r\nlocated at the capital of the Dominion. These have therefore been\r\ntransferred to Ottawa and are now conducted under Dominion regulations.\r\n\r\nThe Ontario bureau of Industries was the basis of organization of the\r\ndepartment. As other work was added the department grew in size and\r\nimportance, and the various branches were instituted until there\r\ndeveloped a well-organized department having the following subdivisions:\r\n\r\n  The Agricultural College,\r\n  The Veterinary College,\r\n  The Agricultural and Horticultural Societies Branch,\r\n  The Live Stock Branch,\r\n  The Farmers' and Women's Institutes Branch,\r\n  The Dairy Branch,\r\n  The Fruit Branch,\r\n  The Statistical Branch,\r\n  The Immigration and Colonization Branch.\r\n\r\nEach branch is in charge of a special officer. In addition to the above\r\nthere is a lot of miscellaneous work, which as it develops will probably\r\nbe organized into separate branches, such as farm forestry, district\r\nrepresentatives, etc.\r\n\r\nJohn Dryden was in 1905 succeeded as minister of Agriculture by Nelson\r\nMonteith, who in 1908 was succeeded by J. S. Duff. Under their care the\r\ndepartment has grown and expanded, and through their recommendations,\r\nyear by year, increasing amounts of money have been obtained for the\r\nextension of agricultural instruction and the more thorough working out\r\nof plans inaugurated in the earlier years of departmental organization.\r\n\r\nThe history of agricultural work in Ontario in recent years may be put\r\nunder two heads--expansion of the various organizations and extension of\r\ntheir operations, and the development of what may be called 'field\r\nwork.' Farmers' institutes and women's institutes have multiplied;\r\nagricultural societies now cover the entire province; local horse\r\nassociations, poultry associations, and beekeepers' associations have\r\nbeen encouraged; winter fairs for live stock have been established at\r\nGuelph and Ottawa; dairy instructors have been increased in number and\r\nefficiency; short courses in live stock, seed improvement, fruit work,\r\nand dairying have been held; and farm drainage has received practical\r\nencouragement. Perhaps the most important advance of late years has\r\nresulted through the appointment of what are known as district\r\nrepresentatives. In co-operation with the department of Education,\r\ngraduates of the Agricultural College have been permanently located in\r\nthe various counties to study the agricultural conditions and to\r\ninitiate and direct any movement that would assist in developing the\r\nagricultural work. These graduates organize short courses at various\r\ncentres, conduct classes in high schools, assist the farmers in\r\nprocuring the best seed, advise as to new lines of work, assist in\r\ndrainage, supervise the care of orchards--in short, they carry the work\r\nof the Agricultural College and of the various branches of the\r\ndepartment right to the farmer, and give that impetus to better farming\r\nwhich can come only from personal contact. The growth of the district\r\nrepresentative system has been remarkable: it was begun in seven\r\ncounties in 1907, by 1910 fifteen counties had representatives, and in\r\n1914 no fewer than thirty-eight counties were so equipped. At first the\r\nfarmers distrusted and even somewhat opposed the movement, but the\r\ndistrict representative soon proved himself so helpful that the\r\ngovernment has found it difficult to comply with the numerous requests\r\nfor these apostles of scientific farming. Approximately $125,000 is\r\nspent each year on the work by the provincial government, in addition to\r\nthe $500 granted annually by the county to each district office. The\r\nresult of all this is that new and more profitable lines of farming are\r\nbeing undertaken, specializing in production is being encouraged, and\r\nOntario agriculture is advancing rapidly along the lines to which the\r\nsoils, the climate, and the people are adapted. A study of the history\r\nof Ontario agriculture shows many changes in the past hundred years, but\r\nat no time has there been so important and so interesting a development\r\nas that which took place in the opening decade of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\n                                               [Signature: C C James]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Note:\r\n\r\nThe following correction was made:\r\n\r\np. 572: Newburg to Newburgh\r\n\r\nSpelling in quoted passages has not been changed.
