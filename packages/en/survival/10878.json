And perhaps\r\nthere is no other animal so much abused, or so little cared for. Popular\r\nopinion of his nature has not been favorable; and he has had to plod and\r\nwork through life against the prejudices of the ignorant. Still, he has\r\nbeen the great friend of man, in war and in peace serving him well and\r\nfaithfully. If he could tell man what he most needed it would be kind\r\ntreatment. We all know how much can be done to improve the condition and\r\nadvance the comfort of this animal; and he is a true friend of humanity\r\nwho does what he can for his benefit. My object in writing this book was\r\nto do what I could toward working out a much needed reform in the\r\nbreeding, care, and treatment of these animals. Let me ask that what I\r\nhave said in regard to the value of kind treatment be carefully read and\r\nfollowed. I have had thirty years' experience in the use of this animal,\r\nand during that time have made his nature a study. The result of that\r\nstudy is, that humanity as well as economy will be best served by\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\nIt has indeed seemed to me that the Government might make a great saving\r\nevery year by employing only such teamsters and wagon-masters as had\r\nbeen thoroughly instructed in the treatment and management of animals,\r\nand were in every way qualified to perform their duties properly.\r\nIndeed, it would seem only reasonable not to trust a man with a valuable\r\nteam of animals, or perhaps a train, until he had been thoroughly\r\ninstructed in their use, and had received a certificate of capacity from\r\nthe Quartermaster's Department. If this were done, it would go far to\r\nestablish a system that would check that great destruction of animal\r\nlife which costs the Government so heavy a sum every year.\r\n\r\nH.R.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _April 12, 1867_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nI have, in another part of this work, spoken of the mule as being free\r\nfrom splint. Perhaps I should have said that I had never seen one that\r\nhad it, notwithstanding the number I have had to do with. There are, I\r\nknow, persons who assert that they have seen mules that had it. I ought\r\nto mention here, also, by way of correction, that there is another\r\nailment the mule does not have in common with the horse, and that is\r\nquarter-crack. The same cause that keeps them from having quarter-crack\r\npreserves them from splint--the want of front action.\r\n\r\nA great many persons insist that a mule has no marrow in the bones of\r\nhis legs. This is a very singular error. The bone of the mule's leg has\r\na cavity, and is as well filled with marrow as the horse's. It also\r\nvaries in just the same proportion as in the horse's leg. The feet of\r\nsome mules, however, will crack and split, but in most cases it is the\r\nresult of bad shoeing. It at times occurs from a lack of moisture to the\r\nfoot; and is seen among mules used in cities, where there are no\r\nfacilities for driving them into running water every day, to soften the\r\nfeet and keep them moist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n  Best Method of Breaking\r\n  Value of Kind Treatment\r\n  How to Harness\r\n  Injured by Working too Young\r\n  What the Mule can Endure\r\n  Color and Peculiar Habits\r\n  Mexican Mules, and Packing\r\n  The Agricultural Committee\r\n  Working Condition of Mules\r\n  Spotted Mules\r\n  Mule-Breeding and Raising\r\n  How Colts should be Handled\r\n  Packing Mules\r\n  Physical Constitution\r\n  Value of Harnessing Properly\r\n  Government Wagons\r\n  More about Breeding Mules\r\n  Ancient History of the Mule\r\n  Table of Statistics\r\n  14 Portraits of Celebrated Mules\r\n  Diseases Common to the Mule, and how they should be treated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nHOW MULES SHOULD BE TREATED IN BREAKING.\r\n\r\nI have long had it in contemplation to write something concerning the\r\nmule, in the hope that it might be of benefit to those who had to deal\r\nwith him, as well in as out of the army, and make them better acquainted\r\nwith his habits and usefulness. The patient, plodding mule is indeed an\r\nanimal that has served us well in the army, and done a great amount of\r\ngood for humanity during the late war. He was in truth a necessity to\r\nthe army and the Government, and performed a most important part in\r\nsupplying our army in the field. That he will perform an equally\r\nimportant part in the future movements of our army is equally clear, and\r\nshould not be lost sight of by the Government. It has seemed to me\r\nsomewhat strange, then, that so little should have been written\r\nconcerning him, and so little pains taken to improve his quality. I have\r\nnoticed in the army that those who had most to do with him were the\r\nleast acquainted with his habits, and took the least pains to study his\r\ndisposition, or to ascertain by proper means how he could be made the\r\nmost useful. The Government might have saved hundreds of thousands of\r\ndollars, if, when the war began, there had been a proper understanding\r\nof this animal among its employees.\r\n\r\nProbably no animal has been the subject of more cruel and brutal\r\ntreatment than the mule, and it is safe to say that no animal ever\r\nperformed his part better, not even the horse. In breaking the mule,\r\nmost persons are apt to get out of patience with him. I have got out of\r\npatience with him myself. But patience is the great essential in\r\nbreaking, and in the use of it you will find that you get along much\r\nbetter. The mule is an unnatural animal, and hence more timid of man\r\nthan the horse; and yet he is tractable, and capable of being taught to\r\nunderstand what you want him to do. And when he understands what you\r\nwant, and has gained your confidence, you will, if you treat him kindly,\r\nhave little trouble in making him perform his duty.\r\n\r\nIn commencing to break the mule, take hold of him gently, and talk to\r\nhim kindly. Don't spring at him, as if he were a tiger you were in dread\r\nof. Don't yell at him; don't jerk him; don't strike him with a club, as\r\nis too often done; don't get excited at his jumping and kicking.\r\nApproach and handle him the same as you would an animal already broken,\r\nand through kindness you will, in less than a week, have your mule more\r\ntractable, better broken, and kinder than you would in a month, had you\r\nused the whip. Mules, with very few exceptions, are born kickers. Breed\r\nthem as you will, the moment they are able to stand up, and you put your\r\nhand on them, they will kick. It is, indeed, their natural means of\r\ndefence, and they resort to it through the force of instinct. In\r\ncommencing to break them, then, kicking is the first thing to guard\r\nagainst and overcome. The young mule kicks because he is afraid of a\r\nman. He has seen those intrusted with their care beat and abuse the\r\nolder ones, and he very naturally fears the same treatment as soon as a\r\nman approaches him. Most persons intrusted with the care of these young\r\nand green mules have not had experience enough with them to know that\r\nthis defect of kicking is soonest remedied by kind treatment. Careful\r\nstudy of the animal's nature and long experience with the animal have\r\ntaught me that, in breaking the mule, whipping and harsh treatment\r\nalmost invariably make him a worse kicker. They certainly make him more\r\ntimid and afraid of you. And just as long as you fight a young mule and\r\nkeep him afraid of you, just so long will you be in danger of his\r\nkicking you. You must convince him through kindness that you are not\r\ngoing to hurt or punish him. And the sooner you do this, the sooner you\r\nare out of danger from his feet.\r\n\r\nIt may at times become necessary to correct the mule before he is\r\nsubdued; but before doing so he should be well bridle or halter-broken,\r\nand also used to harness. He should also be made to know what you are\r\nwhipping him for. In harnessing up a mule that will kick or strike with\r\nthe forefeet, get a rope, or, as we term it in the army, a lariat.\r\nThrow, or put the noose of this over his head, taking care at the same\r\ntime that it be done so that the noose does not choke him; then get the\r\nmule on the near side of a wagon, put the end of the lariat through the\r\nspace between the spokes of the fore wheel, then pull the end through so\r\nthat you can walk back with it to the hinder wheel (taking care to keep\r\nit tight), then pass it through the same, and pull the mule close to the\r\nwagon. In this position you can bridle and harness him without fear of\r\nbeing crippled. In putting the rope through the above places, it should\r\nbe put through the wheels, so as to bring it as high as the mule's\r\nbreast in front, and flanks in the rear. In making them fast in this\r\nway, they frequently kick until they get over the rope, or lariat; hence\r\nthe necessity of keeping it as high up as possible. If you chance upon a\r\nmule so wild that you cannot handle him in this way, put a noose of the\r\nlariat in the mule's mouth, and let the eye, or the part where you put\r\nthe end of the lariat through, be so as to form another noose. Set this\r\ndirectly at the root of the mule's ear, pull it tight on him, taking\r\ncare to keep the noose in the same place. But when you get it pulled\r\ntight enough, let some one hold the end of the lariat, and, my word for\r\nit, you will bridle the mule without much further trouble.\r\n\r\nIn hitching the mule to a wagon, if he be wild or vicious, keep the\r\nlariat the same as I have described until you get him hitched up, then\r\nslack it gently, as nearly all mules will buck or jump stiff-legged as\r\nsoon as you ease up the lariat; and be careful not to pull the rope too\r\ntight when first put on, as by so doing you might split the mule's\r\nmouth. Let me say here that I have broken thousands of four and six-mule\r\nteams that not one of the animals had ever had a strap of harness on\r\nwhen I began with them, and I have driven six-mule teams for years on\r\nthe frontier, but I have yet to see the first team of unbroken mules\r\nthat could be driven with any degree of certainty. I do not mean to say\r\nthat they cannot be got along the road; but I regard it no driving\r\nworthy of the name when a driver cannot get his team to any place where\r\nhe may desire to go in a reasonable time--and this he cannot do with\r\nunbroken mules. With green or unbroken mules, you must chase or herd\r\nthem along without the whip, until you get them to know that you want\r\nthem to pull in a wagon. When you have got them in a wagon, pull their\r\nheads round in the direction you want them to go; then convince them by\r\nyour kindness that you are not going to abuse them, and in twelve days'\r\ncareful handling you will be able to drive them any way you please.\r\n\r\nIn bridling the young mule, it is necessary to have a bit that will not\r\ninjure the animal's mouth. Hundreds of mules belonging to the Government\r\nare, in a measure, ruined by using a bridle bit that is not much thicker\r\nthan the wire used by the telegraph. I do not mean by this that the\r\nbridle bit used by the Government in its blind bridles is not well\r\nadapted to the purpose. If properly made and properly used, it is. Nor\r\ndo I think any board of officers could have gotten up or devised a\r\nbetter harness and wagon for army purposes than those made in conformity\r\nwith the decision of the board of officers that recommended the harness\r\nand wagon now used. The trouble with a great many of the bits is, that\r\nthey are not made up to the regulations, and are too thin. And this bit,\r\nwhen the animal's head is reined up too tight, as army teamsters are\r\nvery likely to do, is sure to work a sore mouth.\r\n\r\nThere are few things in breaking the mule that should be so carefully\r\nguarded against as this. For as soon as the animal gets a sore mouth, he\r\ncannot eat well, and becomes fretful; then he cannot drink well, and as\r\nhis mouth keeps splitting up on the sides, he soon gets so that he\r\ncannot keep water in it, and every swallow he attempts to take, the\r\nwater will spirt out of the sides, just above the bit. As soon as the\r\nmule finds that he cannot drink without this trouble, he very naturally\r\npushes his nose into the water above where his mouth is split, and\r\ndrinks until the want of breath forces him to stop, although he has not\r\nhad sufficient water. The animal, of course, throws up its head, and the\r\nstupid teamster, as a general thing, drives the mule away from the water\r\nwith his thirst about half satisfied.\r\n\r\nMules with their mouths split in this way are not fit to be used in the\r\nteams, and the sooner they are taken out and cured the better for the\r\narmy and the Government. I have frequently seen Government trains\r\ndetained several minutes, block the road, and throw the train into\r\ndisorder, in order to give a mule with a split mouth time to drink. In\r\nmaking up teams for a train, I invariably leave out all mules whose\r\nmouths are not in a sound state, and this I do without regard to the\r\nkind or quality of the animal. But the mule's mouth can be saved from\r\nthe condition I have referred to, if the bit be made in a proper manner.\r\n\r\nThe bit should be one inch and seven-eighths round, and five inches in\r\nthe draw, or between the rings. It should also have a sweep of one\r\nquarter of an inch to the five inches long. I refer now to the bit for\r\nthe blind bridle. With a bit of this kind it is almost impossible to\r\ninjure the mule's mouth, unless he is very young, and it cannot be done\r\nthen if the animal is handled with proper care.\r\n\r\nThere is another matter in regard to harnessing the mule which I deem\r\nworthy of notice here. Government teamsters, as a general thing, like to\r\nsee a mule's head reined tightly up. I confess that, with all my\r\nexperience, I have never seen the benefit there was to be derived from\r\nthis. I always found that the mule worked better when allowed to carry\r\nhis head and neck in a natural position. When not reined up at all, he\r\nwill do more work, out-pull, and wear out the one that is. At present,\r\nnearly all the Government mule-teams are reined up, and worked with a\r\nsingle rein. This is the old Virginia way of driving mules. It used to\r\nbe said that any negro knew enough to drive mules. I fear the Government\r\nhas too long acted on that idea.\r\n\r\nI never heard but one reason given for reining the heads of a mule-team\r\nup tight, and that was, that it made the animals look better.\r\n\r\nThe next thing requiring particular attention is the harnessing. During\r\nthe war it became customary to cut the drawing-chains, or, as some call\r\nthem, the trace-chains. The object of this was, to bring the mule close\r\nup to his work. The theory was taken from the strings of horses used in\r\ndrawing railroad cars through cities. Horses that are used for hauling\r\ncars in this manner are generally fed morning, noon, and night; and are\r\nable to get out of the way of a swingle-tree, should it be let down so\r\nlow as to work on the brakes, as it did too frequently in the army.\r\nBesides, the coupling of the car, or the part they attach the horse to,\r\nis two-thirds the height of a common-sized animal, which, it will be\r\nseen at a glance, is enough to keep the swingle-tree off his heels. Now,\r\nthe tongue of a Government wagon is a very different thing. In its\r\nproper condition, it is about on an average height with the mule's\r\nhocks; and, especially during the last two years of the war, it was\r\ncustomary to pull the mule so close up to the swingle-tree that his\r\nhocks would touch it. The result of hitching in this manner is, that the\r\nmule is continually trying to keep out of the way of the swingle-tree,\r\nand, finding that he cannot succeed, he becomes discouraged. And as soon\r\nas he does this he will lag behind; and as he gets sore from this\r\ncontinual banging, he will spread his hind legs and try to avoid the\r\nblows; and, in doing this, he forgets his business and becomes\r\nirritable. This excites the teamster, and, in ninety-nine cases out of a\r\nhundred, he will beat and punish the animal cruelly, expecting thereby\r\nto cure him of the trouble. But, instead of pacifying the mule, he will\r\nonly make him worse, which should, under no circumstances, be done. The\r\nproper course to pursue, and I say so from long experience, is to stop\r\nthe team at once, and let all the traces out to a length that will allow\r\nthe swingle-tree to swing half way between the hock and the heel of the\r\nhoof. In other words, give him room enough to step, between the collar\r\nand swingle-tree, so that the swingle-tree cannot touch his legs when\r\nwalking at his longest stride. If the above rule be followed, the animal\r\nwill not be apt to touch the swingle-tree. Indeed, it will not be apt to\r\ntouch him, unless he be lazy; and, in that case, the sooner you get\r\nanother mule the better. I say this because one lazy mule will spoil a\r\ngood team, invariably. A lazy mule will be kept up to his work with a\r\nwhip, you will say; but, in whipping a lazy animal, you keep the others\r\nin such a state of excitement that they are certain to get poor and\r\nvalueless.\r\n\r\nThere is another advantage in having the drawing-chains worked at the\r\nlength I have described. It is this: The officers that formed the board\r\nthat recommended the drawing-chain, also recommended a number of large\r\nlinks on one end of the chain, so that it could be made longer or\r\nshorter, as desired. If made in conformity with the recommendation of\r\nthat board of officers, it can be let out so as to fit the largest sized\r\nmule, and can be taken up to fit the shortest. When I say this, I mean\r\nto include such animals as are received according to the standard of the\r\nQuartermaster-General's department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. THE DISADVANTAGES OF WORKING MULES THAT ARE TOO YOUNG.\r\n\r\n\r\nA great many of the mules purchased by the Government during the war\r\nwere entirely too young for use. This was particularly so in the West,\r\nwhere both contractor and inspector seemed anxious only to get the\r\ngreatest number they could on the hands of the Government, without\r\nrespect to age or quality. I have harnessed, or rather tried to harness,\r\nmules during the war, that were so young and small that you could not\r\nget collars small enough to fit them. As to the harness, they were\r\nalmost buried in it. A great many of these small mules were but two\r\nyears old. These animals were of no use to the Government for a long\r\ntime. Indeed, the inspector might just as well have given his\r\ncertificate for a lot of milk cows, so far as they added to our force of\r\ntransportation. Another source of trouble has been caused through a\r\nmistaken opinion as to what a young mule could do, and how he ought to\r\nbe fed. Employers and others, who had young mules under their charge\r\nduring the war, had, as a general thing, surplus forage on hand. When\r\nthey were in a place where nine pounds of grain could be procured, and\r\nfourteen of hay, the full allowance was purchased. The surplus resulting\r\nfrom this attracted notice, and many wondered why it was that the\r\nGovernment did not reduce the forage on the mule. These persons did not\r\nfor a moment suspect, or imagine, that a three year old mule has so many\r\nloose teeth in his mouth as to be hardly able to crack a grain of corn,\r\nor masticate his oats.\r\n\r\nAnother point in that case is this: at three years old, a mule is in a\r\nworse condition, generally, than he is at any other period in life. At\r\nthree, he is more subject to distemper, sore eyes, and inflammation of\r\nall parts of the head and body. He becomes quite weak from not being\r\nable to eat, gets loose and gaunt, and is at that time more subject and\r\nmore apt to take contagious diseases than at any other change he may go\r\nthrough. There is but one sure way to remedy this evil. Do not buy three\r\nyear old mules to put to work that it requires a five or six year old\r\nmule to perform. Six three year old mules are just about as fit to\r\ntravel fifteen miles per day, with an army wagon loaded with twenty-five\r\nhundred and their forage, as a boy, six years of age, is fit to do a\r\nman's work. During the first twelve months of the war, I had charge of\r\none hundred and six mule-teams, and I noticed in particular, that not\r\none solitary mule as high as six years old gave out on the trips that I\r\nmade with the teams. I also noticed that, on most occasions, the three\r\nyear olds gave out, or became so leg-weary that they could scarce walk\r\nout of the way of the swingle-tree, whereas those of four and upward\r\nwould be bright and brisk, and able to eat their forage when they came\r\nto camp. The three year old mules would lie down and not eat a bite,\r\nthrough sheer exhaustion. I also noticed that nearly all the three year\r\nold mules that went to Utah, in 1857, froze to death that winter, while\r\nthose whose ages varied from four, and up to ten, stood the winter and\r\ncame out in the spring in good working condition. In August, 1855, I\r\ndrove a six-mule team to Fort Riley, in Kansas Territory, from Fort\r\nLeavenworth, on the Missouri River, loaded with twelve sacks of grain.\r\nIt took us thirteen days to make the trip. When we reached Fort Riley\r\nthere were not fifty mules, in the train of one hundred and fifty, that\r\nwould have sold at public sale for thirty dollars, and a great many gave\r\nout on account of being too young and the want of proper treatment. In\r\nthe fall of 1860, I drove a six-mule team, loaded with thirty hundred\r\nweight, twenty-five days' rations for myself and another man, and twelve\r\ndays' storage for the team, being allowed twelve pounds to each mule per\r\nday. I drove this team to Fort Laramie, in Nebraska Territory, and from\r\nthere to Fort Leavenworth, on the Missouri River. I made the drive there\r\nand back in thirty-eight days, and laid over two and a half days out of\r\nthat. The distance travelled was twelve hundred and thirty-six miles.\r\nAfter a rest of two days, I started with the same team, and drove to\r\nFort Scott, in Kansas Territory, in five days, a distance of one hundred\r\nand twenty miles. I went with Harney's command, and, for the most part\r\nof the time, had no hay, and was forced to subsist our animals on dry\r\nprairie grass, and had a poor supply of even that. Notwithstanding this,\r\nI do not believe that any mule in the team lost as much as ten pounds of\r\nflesh. Each of these mules, let me say, was upward of five years old.\r\n\r\nIn 1858, I took a train of mules to Camp Floyd, in Utah, forty-eight\r\nmiles south of Salt Lake City; During the march there were days and\r\nnights that I could not get a drop of water for the animals. The young\r\nmules, three and four years old, gave out from sheer exhaustion; while\r\nthe older ones kept up, and had to draw the wagons along. Now, there are\r\nmany purposes to which a young mule may be put with advantage; but they\r\nare altogether unfit for army purposes, and the sooner the Government\r\nstops using them, the better.\r\n\r\nWhen they are purchased for army use, they are almost sure to be put\r\ninto a train, and turned over to the tender mercies of some teamster,\r\nwho knows nothing whatever about the character of the animal. And here\r\nlet me say that thousands of the best mules in the army, during the war,\r\nwere ruined and made useless to the Government on account of the\r\nincompetency and ignorance of the wagon-masters and teamsters who had to\r\ndeal with them. Persons who own private teams and horses are generally\r\nparticular to know the character of the person who takes care of them,\r\nand to ascertain that he knows his business. Is he a good driver? Is he\r\na good groom? Is he careful in feeding and watering? These are the\r\nquestions that are asked; and if he has not these qualities he will not\r\ndo. But a teamster in the army has none of these questions put to him.\r\nNo; he is intrusted with a valuable team, and expected to take proper\r\ncare of it when he has not the first qualification to do so. If he is\r\nasked a question at all, it is merely if he has ever driven a team\r\nbefore. If he answer in the affirmative, and there are any vacancies, he\r\nis employed at once, though he may not know how to lead a mule by the\r\nhead properly. This is not alone the case with teamsters. I have known\r\nwagon-masters who really did not know how to straighten out a six-mule\r\nteam, or, indeed, put the harness on them properly. And yet the\r\nwagon-master has almost complete power over the train. It will be\r\nreadily seen from this, how much valuable property may be destroyed by\r\nplacing incompetent men in such places. Wagon-masters, it seems to me,\r\nshould not be allowed, under any circumstances, to have or take charge\r\nof a train of animals of any kind until they are thoroughly competent to\r\nhandle, harness, and drive a six-animal team.\r\n\r\nThere is another matter which needs essential improvement. I refer now\r\nto the men who are placed as superintendents over our Government corrals\r\nand depots for animals. Many of these men know little of either the\r\nhorse or the mule, and are almost entirely ignorant of what is necessary\r\nfor transportation. A superintendent should have a thorough knowledge of\r\nthe character and capacity of all kinds of animals necessary for a good\r\nteam. He should know at sight the age and weight of animals, should be\r\nable to tell the most suitable place for different animals in a team,\r\nand where each would be of the most service. He should know all parts of\r\nhis wagon and harness at a glance, be able to take each portion apart\r\nand put them together again, each in its proper shape and place, and,\r\nabove all, he should have practical experience with all kinds of animals\r\nthat are used in the army. This is especially necessary during war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. COLOR, CHARACTER, AND PECULIARITIES OF MULES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter being in command of the upper corral, I was ordered, on the 7th of\r\nSeptember, 1864, to take charge of the Eastern Branch Wagon Park,\r\nWashington. There were at that time in the park twenty-one six-mule\r\ntrains. Each train had one hundred and fifty mules and two horses\r\nattached. There were times, however, when we had as many as forty-two\r\ntrains of six-mule teams, with thirty men attached to each train. In a\r\nyear from the above date we handled upward of seventy-four thousand\r\nmules, each and every one passing under my inspection and through my\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nIn handling this large number of animals, I aimed to ascertain which was\r\nthe best, the hardest, and the most durable color for a mule. I did this\r\nbecause great importance has been attached by many to the color of these\r\nanimals. Indeed, some of our officers have made it a distinguishing\r\nfeature. But color, I am satisfied, is no criterion to judge by. There\r\nis an exception to this, perhaps, in the cream-colored mule. In most\r\ncases, these cream-colored mules are apt to be soft, and they also lack\r\nstrength. This is particularly so with those that take after the mare,\r\nand have manes and tails of the same color. Those that take after the\r\njack generally have black stripes round their legs, black manes and\r\ntails, and black stripes down their backs and across their shoulders,\r\nand are more hardy and better animals. I have frequently seen men, in\r\npurchasing a lot of mules, select those of a certain color, fancying\r\nthat they were the hardiest, and yet the animals would be widely\r\ndifferent in their working qualities. You may take a black mule, black\r\nmane, black hair in his ears, black at the flank, between the hips or\r\nthighs, and black under the belly, and put him alongside of a similar\r\nsized mule, marked as I have described above, say light, or what is\r\ncalled mealy-colored, on each of the above-mentioned parts, put them in\r\nthe same condition and flesh, of similar age and soundness, and, in many\r\ncases, the mule with the light-colored parts will wear the other out.\r\n\r\nIt is very different with the white mule. He is generally soft, and can\r\nstand but little hardship. I refer particularly to those that have a\r\nwhite skin. Next to the white and cream, we have the iron-grey mule.\r\nThis color generally indicates a hardy mule. We have now twelve teams of\r\niron-gray mules in the park, which have been doing hard work every day\r\nsince July, 1865; it is now January, 1866. Only one of these mules has\r\nbecome unfit for service, and that one was injured by being kicked by\r\nhis mate. All our other teams have had more or less animals made unfit\r\nfor service and exchanged.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the color of mules, it must not be inferred that there\r\nare no mules that are all of a color that are not hardy and capable of\r\nendurance. I have had some, whose color did not vary from head to foot,\r\nthat were capable of great endurance. But in most cases, if kept\r\nsteadily at work from the time they were three years old until they were\r\neight or ten, they generally gave out in some part, and became an\r\nexpense instead of profit.\r\n\r\nVarious opinions are held as to what the mule can be made to do under\r\nthe saddle, many persons asserting that in crossing the plains he can be\r\nmade to perform almost equal to the horse. This is true on the prairie.\r\nBut there he works with every advantage over the horse. In 1858, I rode\r\na mule from Cedar Valley, forty-eight miles north of Salt Lake City, to\r\nFort Leavenworth, Kansas, a distance of nearly fourteen hundred miles.\r\nStarting from Cedar Valley on the 22d of October, I reached Fort\r\nLeavenworth on the 31st of December. At the end of the journey the\r\nanimal was completely worn down.\r\n\r\nIn this condition I put her into Fleming's livery stable, in Leavenworth\r\nCity, and was asked if she was perfectly gentle. One would suppose that,\r\nin such a condition, she would naturally be so. I assured the hostler\r\nthat she was; that I had ridden her nearly a year, and never knew her to\r\nkick. That same morning, when the hostler went to feed her, she suddenly\r\nbecame vicious, and kicked him very severely. She was then about twelve\r\nyears old. I have since thought that when a mule gets perfectly gentle\r\nhe is unfit for service.\r\n\r\nProprietors of omnibuses, stage lines, and city railroads have, in many\r\ncases, tried to work mules, as a matter of economy; but, as a general\r\nthing, the experiment proved a failure, and they gave it up and returned\r\nto horses. The great reason for this failure was, that the persons\r\nplaced in charge of them knew nothing of their disposition, and lacked\r\nthat experience in handling them which is so necessary to success. But\r\nit must be admitted that, as a general thing, they are not well adapted\r\nfor road or city purposes, no matter how much you may understand driving\r\nand handling them.\r\n\r\nThe mule may be made to do good service on the prairies, in supplying\r\nour army, in towing canal boats in hauling cars inside of coal mines--\r\nthese are his proper places, where he can jog along and take his own\r\ntime, patiently. Work of this kind would, however, in nearly all cases,\r\nbreak down the spirit of the horse, and render him useless in a very\r\nshort time.\r\n\r\nI have seen it asserted that there were mules that had been known to\r\ntrot in harness in three minutes. In all my experience, I have never\r\nseen any thing of the kind, and do not believe the mule ever existed\r\nthat could do it. It is a remarkably good road horse that will do this,\r\nand I have never yet seen a mule that could compare for speed with a\r\ngood roadster. I have driven mules, single and double, night and day,\r\nfrom two to ten in a team, and have handled them in every way that it is\r\npossible to handle them, and have in my charge at this time two hundred\r\nof the best mule teams in the world, and there is not a span among them\r\nthat could be forced over the road in four minutes. It is true of the\r\nmule that he will stand more abuse, more beating, more straining and\r\nconstant dogging at him than any other animal used in a team. But all\r\nthe work you can get out of him, over and above an ordinary day's work,\r\nyou have to work as hard as he does to accomplish.\r\n\r\nSome curious facts have come under my knowledge as to what the mule can\r\nendure. These facts also illustrate what can be done with the animal by\r\npersons thoroughly acquainted with his character. While on the plains, I\r\nhave known Kiowa and Camanche Indians to break into our pickets during\r\nthe night, and steal mules that had been pronounced completely broken\r\ndown by white men. And these mules they have ridden sixty and sixty-five\r\nmiles of a single night. How these Indians managed to do this, I never\r\ncould tell. I have repeatedly seen Mexicans mount mules that our men had\r\npronounced unfit for further service, and ride them twenty and\r\ntwenty-five miles without stopping. I do not mention this to show that a\r\nMexican can do more with the mule than an American. He cannot. And yet\r\nthere seems to be some sort of fellow-feeling between these Mexicans and\r\nthe mule. One seems to understand the other completely; and in\r\ndisposition there is very little difference. And yet the Mexican is so\r\nbrutish in dealing with animals, that I never allowed one of them to\r\ndrive a Government team for me. Indeed, a low Mexican does not seem\r\ndisposed to work for a man who will not allow him full latitude in the\r\nabuse of animals.\r\n\r\n_Packing Mules_.--The Mexican is a better packer than the American. He\r\nhas had more experience, and understands all its details better than any\r\nother man. Some of our United States officers have tried to improve on\r\nthe experience of the Greaser, and have made what they called an\r\nimprovement on the Mexican pack-saddle. But all the attempts at\r\nimprovement have been utter failures. The ranchero, on the Pacific side\r\nof the Sierra Nevadas, is also a good packer; and he can beat the\r\nMexican lassoing cattle. But he is the only man in the United States who\r\ncan. The reason for this is, that they went into that country when very\r\nyoung, and improved on the Mexican, by having cattle, mules, and horses\r\nround them all the time, and being continually catching them for the\r\npurpose of branding and marking.\r\n\r\nThere is, in Old as well as New Mexico, a class of mules that are known\r\nto us as Spanish, or Mexican mules. These mules are not large, but for\r\nendurance they are very superior, and, in my opinion, cannot be\r\nexcelled. I am not saying too much when I assert, that I have seen\r\nnothing in the United States that could compare with them. They can,\r\napparently, stand any amount of starvation and abuse. I have had three\r\nSpanish mules in a train of twenty-five six-mule teams, and starting\r\nfrom Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, on Colonel (since General) Sumner's\r\nexpedition, in 1857, have travelled to Walnut Creek, on the Santa Fe\r\nroute, a distance of three hundred miles, in nine days. And this in the\r\nmonth of August. The usual effects of hard driving, I noticed, showed\r\nbut very little on them. I noticed also, along the march, that with a\r\nhalt of less than three hours, feeding on grass that was only tolerably\r\nthick, they will fill up better and look in better condition for\r\nresuming the march, than one of our American mules that had rested five\r\nhours, and had the same forage. The breed, of course, has something to\r\ndo with this. But the animal is smaller, more compact than our mules,\r\nand, of course, it takes less to fill him up. It stands to reason, that\r\na mule with a body half as large as a hogshead cannot satisfy his hunger\r\nin the time it would take a small one. This is the secret of small mules\r\noutlasting large ones on the prairies. It takes the large one so long to\r\nfind enough to eat, when the grass is scanty, that he has not time\r\nenough for rest and recuperation. I often found them leaving camp, in\r\nthe morning, quite as hungry and discouraged as they were when we halted\r\nthe previous evening. With the small mule it is different. He gets\r\nenough to eat, quick, and has time to rest and refresh himself. The\r\nSpanish or Mexican mule, however, is better as a pack animal, than for a\r\nteam. They are vicious, hard to break, and two-thirds of them kick.\r\n\r\nIn looking over a book, with the title of \"Domestic Animals,\" I notice\r\nthat the author, Mr. R.L. Allen, has copied from the official report of\r\nthe Agricultural Committee of South Carolina, and asserts that a mule is\r\nfit for service sooner than a horse. This is not true; and to prove that\r\nit is not, I will give what I consider to be ample proof. In the first\r\nplace, a mule at three years old is just as much and even more of a colt\r\nthan a horse is. And he is as much out of condition, on account of\r\ncutting teeth, distemper, and other colt ailments, as it is possible to\r\nbe. Get a three year old mule tired and fatigued, and in nine cases out\r\nof ten he will get so discouraged that it will be next to impossible to\r\nget him home or into camp. A horse colt, if able to travel at all, will\r\nwork his way home cheerfully; but the young mule will sulk, and in many\r\ninstances will not move an inch while life lasts. An honest horse will\r\ntry to help himself, and do all he can for you, especially if you treat\r\nhim kindly. The mule colt will, just as likely as not, do all he can to\r\nmake it inconvenient for you and him.\r\n\r\nTo show of how little service three year old mules are to the\r\nGovernment, I will give the number handled by me during part of 1864 and\r\n1865.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of September, 1864, I had charge of five thousand and\r\neighty-two mules; and during the same month I received two thousand two\r\nhundred and ten, and issued to the Armies of the Potomac, the James, and\r\nthe Shenandoah, three thousand five hundred and seventy-one, which left\r\nus on hand, on the 1st of October, three thousand seven hundred and\r\ntwenty-one. During the month of October we received only nine hundred\r\nand eighty, and issued two thousand five hundred and thirty, which left\r\nus on hand, on the 1st of November, two thousand one hundred and\r\nseventy-one. During November we received two thousand one hundred and\r\neighty-six, and issued to the army one thousand seven hundred and\r\nfifty-seven, which left us on hand, on the 1st of December, two thousand\r\nfour hundred and thirty mules. Now mark the deaths.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of September, 1864, there died in the corral fifteen\r\nmules. In October, six died. In November, three; and in December, eight.\r\nThey were all two and three years old.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of May, 1865, we had on hand four thousand and twelve head,\r\nand received, during the same month, seven thousand nine hundred and\r\nfifty-eight. We issued, during the same month, fifteen thousand five\r\nhundred and sixty-three, leaving us on hand, on the 1st of June, six\r\nthousand four hundred and eighty-seven. During this month we received\r\nseven thousand nine hundred and fifty-one, and issued eleven thousand\r\nnine hundred and fifteen. Our mules during these months were sent out to\r\nbe herded, and the total number of deaths during the time was\r\ntwenty-four. But two of them were over four years old. Now, it occurs to\r\nme that it would be a great saving to the Government not to purchase any\r\nmules under four years old. This statement of deaths at the corral is as\r\nnothing when compared with the number of deaths of young mules in the\r\nfield. It is, in fact, well established that fully two-thirds of the\r\ndeaths in the field are of young animals under three years of age. This\r\nwaste of animal life carries with it an expense it would be difficult to\r\nestimate, but which a remedy might easily be found for.\r\n\r\nNow, it is well known that when a mule has reached the age of four\r\nyears, you will have very little trouble with him, so far as sickness\r\nand disease are concerned. Besides, at the age of four he is able to\r\nwork, and work well; and he also understands better what you want him to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nThe committee appointed to report on this subject say many mules have\r\nbeen lost by feeding on cut straw and corn meal. This is something\r\nentirely new to me; and I am of opinion that more Government mules die\r\nbecause they do not get enough of this straw and meal. The same\r\ncommittee say, also, that in no instance have they known them to be\r\ninflicted with disease other than inflammation of the intestines, caused\r\nby exposure. I only wish that the members of that committee could have\r\nhad access to the affidavits in the Quartermaster-General's department--\r\nthey would then have satisfied themselves that thousands of Government\r\nmules have died with almost every disease the horse is subject to. And I\r\ndo not see why they should not be liable to the same diseases, since\r\nthey derive life and animation from the horse. The mule that breeds\r\nclosest after the jack, and is marked like him, is the hardiest, can\r\nstand fatigue the best, and is less liable to those diseases common to\r\nthe horse; while those which breed close after the mare, and have no\r\nmarks of the jack about them, are liable to all of them.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of this chapter I spoke of the color of mules. I will,\r\nin closing, make a few more remarks on that subject, which may interest\r\nthe reader. We have now at work three dun-colored mules, that were\r\ntransferred to the Army of the Potomac in 1862, and that went through\r\nall the campaigns of that army, and were transferred back to us in June,\r\n1865. They had been steadily at work, and yet were in good condition,\r\nhardy, and bright, when they were turned in. These mules have a black\r\nstripe across their shoulders, down their backs, and are what is called\r\n\"dark-colored duns.\" We also have the only full team that has gone\r\nthrough all the campaigns of the Army of the Potomac. It was fitted up\r\nat Annapolis, Md., in September, 1861, under Captain Santelle, A.Q.M.\r\nThey are now in fine condition, and equal to any thing we have in the\r\ncorral. The leaders are very fine animals. They are fourteen hands high,\r\none weighing eight hundred, and the other eight hundred and forty-five\r\npounds. One of the middle leaders weighs nine hundred, the other nine\r\nhundred and forty-seven pounds, and fourteen hands and a half high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. DISEASES MULES ARE LIABLE TO.--WHAT HE CAN DRAW, ETC., ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe committee also say that the mule is a more steady animal in his\r\ndraft than the horse. I think this the greatest mistake the committee\r\nhas made. You have only to observe the manner in which a dray or\r\nheavily-loaded wagon will toss a mule about, and the way he will toss\r\nhimself around on the road, to be satisfied that the committee have\r\nformed an erroneous opinion on that point. In starting with a load, the\r\nmule, in many cases, works with his feet as if they were set on a pivot,\r\nand hence does not take so firm a hold of the ground as the horse does.\r\nI have never yet seen a mule in a dray or cart that could keep it from\r\njolting him round. In the first place, he has not the power to steady a\r\ndray; and, in the second place, they never can be taught to do it. In\r\nfine, they have not the formation to handle a dray or cart. What, then,\r\nbecomes of the idea that they are as steady in drays or teams as the\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nThe committee also say that mules are not subject to such ailments as\r\nhorses--spavin, glanders, ringbone, and bots. If I had the committee\r\nhere, I would show its members that every other mule in the\r\nquartermasters' department, over fifteen and a half hands high, is\r\neither spavined, ringboned, or ill some way injured by the above-named\r\ndiseases. The mule may not be so liable to spavin as the horse, but he\r\nhas ringbone just the same. I cannot, for the life of me, see how the\r\ncommittee could have fallen into this error. There is this, however, to\r\nbe taken into consideration: the mule is not of so sensitive a nature as\r\nthe horse, and will bear pain without showing it in lameness. The close\r\nobserver, however, can easily detect it. One reason why they do not show\r\nspavin and ringbone so much at the horse, is because our blacksmiths do\r\nnot cut their heels as low as they do a horse's, and consequently that\r\npart of the foot is not made to work so hard. If you believe a mule has\r\na ringbone, and yet is not lame, just cut his heel down low, and give\r\nhim a few good pulls in a muddy place, and he will soon develop to you\r\nboth lameness and ringbone. Cut his toes down and leave his heels high,\r\nand he will not be apt to go lame with it.\r\n\r\nThe committee also say that a Mr. Elliott, of the Patuxent Furnaces,\r\nsays they hardly ever had a mule die of disease. This is a strange\r\nstatement; for the poorest teams I ever saw, and the very worst bred\r\nstock, were on the Patuxent River, through the southern part of\r\nMaryland, and at the markets on Washington City. It is pitiable to see,\r\nas you can on market days, the shabby teams driven by the farmers of\r\neastern and southern Maryland. A more broken-hearted, poverty-stricken,\r\nand dejected-looking set of teams can be seen nowhere else. The people\r\nof Maryland have raised good horses; it is high time they waked up to\r\nthe necessity, and even profit, of raising a better kind of mule.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the draft power of mules, in comparison with horses, there\r\nare various opinions; and yet it is one which ought to be easily\r\nsettled. I have tested mules to the very utmost of their strength, and\r\nit was very rare to find a pair that could draw thirty hundred weight a\r\nsingle year, without being used up completely. Now, it is well known\r\nthat in the northern and western States you can find any number of pairs\r\nof horses that will draw thirty-five and forty hundred weight anywhere.\r\nAnd they will keep doing it, day after day, and retain their condition.\r\n\r\nThere was one great difficulty the Agricultural Committee of South\r\nCarolina had to contend with, and it was this. At the time it had the\r\nsubject of the mule under consideration, he was not used generally\r\nthroughout the United States. I can easily understand, therefore, that\r\nthe committee obtained its knowledge from the very few persons who had\r\nthem, and made the best report it could under the circumstances. Indeed,\r\nI firmly believe the report was written with the intention of giving\r\ncorrect information, but it failed entirely. In recommending any thing\r\nof this kind, great care should be taken not to lead the inexperienced\r\nastray, and to give only such facts as are obtained from thorough\r\nknowledge; and no man should be accepted as authority in the care and\r\ntreatment of animals, unless he has had long experience with them, and\r\nhas made them a subject of study.\r\n\r\nA few words more on breaking the mule. Don't fight or abuse him. After\r\nyou have harnessed him, and he proves to be refractory, keep your own\r\ntemper, slack your reins, push him round, backward and forward, not\r\nroughly; and if he will not go, and do what you want, tie him to a post\r\nand let him stand there a day or so without food or water. Take care,\r\nalso, that he does not lie down, and be careful to have a person to\r\nguard him, so that he does not foul in the harness. If he will not go,\r\nafter a day or two of this sort of treatment, give him one or two more\r\nof it, and my word for it, he will come to his senses and do any thing\r\nyou want from that time forward. Some persons assert that the mule is a\r\nvery cunning animal; others assert that he is dull and stupid, and\r\ncannot be made to understand what you want. He is, I admit, what may be\r\ncalled a tricky animal; but, for experiment sake, just play one or two\r\ntricks with him, and he will show you by his action that he understands\r\nthem well. Indeed, he knows a great deal more than he generally gets\r\ncredit for, and few animals are more capable of appreciating proper\r\ntreatment. Like many other species of animal, there are scarcely two to\r\nbe found of precisely the same temper and disposition, if we except the\r\nsingle vice of kicking, which they will all do, especially when well fed\r\nand rested. And we can excuse even this vice in consideration of the\r\nfact, that the mule is not a natural animal, but only an invention of\r\nman. Some persons are inclined to think that, when a mule is a kicker,\r\nhe has not been properly broken. I doubt if you can break a mule so that\r\nhe will not kick a stranger at sight, especially if he be under six\r\nyears old. The only way to keep a mule from kicking you is to handle it\r\na great deal when young, and accustom it to the ways and actions of men.\r\nYou must through kindness convince it that you are not going to harm or\r\nabuse it; and you can do that best by taking hold of it in a gentle\r\nmanner every time it appears to be frightened. Such treatment I have\r\nalways found more effective than all the beating and abusing you can\r\napply.\r\n\r\nThere is another fault the mule has to contend against. It is the common\r\nbelief among teamsters and others that he has less confidence in man\r\nthan the horse has, and to improve this they almost invariably apply the\r\nwhip. The reason for this want of confidence is readily found in the\r\nfact that mule colts are never handled with that degree of kindness and\r\ncare that horse colts are. They are naturally more stubborn than the\r\nhorse, and most of those persons who undertake to halter or harness them\r\nfor the first time are even more stubborn in their disposition than the\r\nmule. They commence to break the animal by beating him in the most\r\nunmerciful manner, and that at once so excites the mule's stubbornness,\r\nthat many of them, in this condition, would not move an inch if you were\r\nto cut them to pieces. And let me say here that nothing should be so\r\nmuch avoided in breaking this animal as the whip. The young, unbroken\r\nmule cannot be made to understand what you are whipping him for.\r\n\r\nIt is a habit with mule drivers in the army, many of whom are men\r\nwithout feeling for a dumb animal, to whip mules just to hear their\r\nwhips crack, and to let others hear with what dexterity they can do it.\r\nIt has a very bad effect on the animals, and some means should be\r\napplied to stop it. Army teamsters and stable-men seem to regard it as a\r\nvirtue to be cruel to animals. They soon cultivate vicious habits, and a\r\nbad temper seems to grow up with their occupation. It naturally follows,\r\nthen, that in the treatment of their animals they do just what they\r\nought not to do. The Government has been a very severe sufferer by this;\r\nand I contend that during a war it is just as necessary to have\r\nexperienced and well trained teamsters as it is to have hardened and\r\nwell trained soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe mule is peculiar in his dislikes. Many of them, when first\r\nharnessed, so dislike a blind bridle that they will not work in it. When\r\nyou find this, let him stand for say a day in the blinders, and then\r\ntake them off, and in forty-nine cases out of fifty he will go at once.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the mule never scares or runs away. This is not\r\ntrue. He is not so apt to get frightened and run away as the horse is.\r\nBut any one who has had long experience with them in the army knows that\r\nthey will both get frightened and run away. They do not, however, lose\r\nall their senses when they get frightened and run away, as the horse\r\ndoes. Bring a mule back after he has run away, and in most cases he will\r\nnot want to do it again. A horse that has once run away, however, is\r\nnever safe afterward. Indeed, in all the tens of thousands of mules that\r\nI have handled, I never yet found an habitual runaway. Their sluggish\r\nnature does not incline them to such tricks. If a team attempts to run\r\naway, one or two of them will fall down before they have gone far, and\r\nthis will stop the remainder. Attempt to put one up to the same speed\r\nyou would a horse, over a rough road, and you will have performed\r\nwonders if he does not fall and break your bones.\r\n\r\nThe mule, especially if large, cannot stand hard roads and pavements.\r\nHis limbs are too small for his body, and they generally give out. You\r\nwill notice that all good judges of road and trotting horses like to see\r\na good strong bone in the leg. This is actually necessary. The mule, you\r\nwill notice, is very deficient in leg, and generally have poor muscle.\r\nAnd many of them are what is called cat-hammed.\r\n\r\n_Working Condition of Mules_.--Most persons, when they see a good, fat,\r\nslick mule, are apt to exclaim: \"What a fine mule there is!\" He takes it\r\nfor granted that because the animal is fat, tall, and heavy, he must be\r\na good work animal. This, however, is no criterion to judge by. A mule,\r\nto be in good condition for work, should never be any fatter than what\r\nis known as good working condition. One of fourteen and a half hands\r\nhigh, to be in good working condition, should not weigh over nine\r\nhundred and fifty pounds. One of fifteen hands high should not weigh\r\nover one thousand pounds. If he does, his legs will in a very short time\r\ngive out, and he will have to go to the hospital. In working a mule with\r\ntoo much flesh, it will produce curbs, spavin, ringbone, or crooked\r\nhocks. The muscles and tendons of their small legs are not capable of\r\ncarrying a heavy weight of body for any length of time. He may not, as I\r\nhave said before, show his blemishes in lameness, but it is only because\r\nhe lacks that fine feeling common to the horse. I have, singular as it\r\nmay seem, known mules that have been spavined, curbed, and ringboned,\r\nand yet have been worked for years without exhibiting lameness.\r\n\r\nAvoid spotted, or dapple mules; they are the very poorest animal you can\r\nget. They cannot stand hard work, and once they get diseased and begin\r\nto lose strength, there is no saving them. The Mexicans call them\r\npintos, or painted mules. We call them calico Arabians or Chickasaws.\r\nThey have generally bad eyes, which get very sore during the heat and\r\ndust of summer, when many of them go blind. Many of the snow-white mules\r\nare of the same description, and about as useless. Mules with the white\r\nmuzzle, or, as some term it, white-nore white, and with white rings\r\nround the eyes, are also of but little account as work mules. They can\r\nstand no hardship of any kind. Government, at least, should never\r\npurchase them. In purchasing mules, you must look well to the age, form,\r\nheight, eyes, size of bone and muscle, and disposition; for these are of\r\nmore importance than his color. Get these right and you will have a good\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nIf any gentleman wants to purchase a mule for the saddle, let him get\r\none bred closer after the mare than the jack. They are more docile,\r\nhandle easier, and are more tractable, and will do what you want with\r\nless trouble than the other. If possible, also, get mare mules; they are\r\nmuch more safe and trusty under the saddle, and less liable to get\r\nstubborn. They are also better than a horse mule for team purposes. In\r\nshort, if I were purchasing mules for myself, I would give at least\r\nfifteen dollars more for mare mules than I would for horse. They are\r\nsuperior to the horse mule in every way. One reason is, that they\r\npossess all their natural faculties, while you deprive the horse of his\r\nby altering.\r\n\r\nThe most disagreeable and unmanageable, and I was going to say useless,\r\nanimal in the world, is a stud mule. They are no benefit to anybody, and\r\nyet they are more troublesome than any other animal. They rarely ever\r\nget fat, and are always fretting; and it is next to impossible to keep\r\nthem from breaking loose and getting at mares. Besides, they are\r\nexceedingly dangerous to have amongst horses. They will frequently fly\r\nat the horse, like a tiger, and bite, tear, and kick him to pieces. I\r\nhave known them to shut their eyes, become furious, and dash over both\r\nman and beast to get at a mare. It is curious, also, that a white mare\r\nseems to have the greatest attractions for them. I have known a stud\r\nmule to take a fancy to a white mare, and it seemed impossible to keep\r\nhim away from her. Mules of all kinds, however, seem to have a peculiar\r\nfancy for white mares and horses, and when this attachment is once\r\nformed, it is almost impossible to separate them. If you want to drive a\r\nherd of five hundred mules any distance, turn a white or gray mare in\r\namong them for two or three days, and they will become so attached to\r\nher that you may turn them out, and they will follow her anywhere. Just\r\nlet a man lead the mare, and with two men mounted you can manage the\r\nwhole herd almost as well as if they were in a team. Another way to lead\r\nmules is, to put a bell on the mare's neck. The mules will listen for\r\nthat bell like a lot of school children, and will follow its tinkling,\r\nwith the same instinct.\r\n\r\nAnother curious thing about the mule is this: You may hitch him up\r\nto-day for the first time, and he may become sullen and refuse to go a\r\nstep for you. This may be very provoking, and perhaps excite your\r\ntemper; but do not let it, for ten chances to one, if you take him out\r\nof the harness to-day and put him in again to-morrow, that he will go\r\nright off, and do any thing you want him. It is best always to get a\r\nyoung mule well used to the harness before you try to work him in a\r\nteam. When you get him so that he is not afraid of the harness, you may\r\nconsider your mule two-thirds broke.\r\n\r\nI have seen it asserted that a team of mules was more easily handled\r\nthan a team of horses. It is impossible that this can be so, for the\r\nreason that you never can make a mule as bridle-wise as a horse. To\r\nfurther prove that this cannot be so, let any reinsman put as many mules\r\ntogether as there are horses in the \"band wagon\" of a show, or circus,\r\nand see what he can do with them. There is not a driver living who can\r\nrein them with the same safety that he can a horse, and for the very\r\nreason, that whenever the mule finds that he has the advantage of you,\r\nhe will keep it in spite of all you can do.\r\n\r\n_Mule Raising_.--I never could understand why it was that almost every\r\nperson, that raises stock, recommends big, ugly gollips of mares, for\r\nmule-breeding. The principle is certainly a wrong one, as a little study\r\nof nature must show. To produce a good, well-proportioned mule, you must\r\nhave a good, compact, and serviceable mare. It is just as necessary as\r\nin the crossing of any other animal. It certainly is more profitable to\r\nraise good animals than poor ones; and you cannot raise good mules from\r\nbad mares, no matter what the jack is. You invariably see the bad mare\r\nin the flabby, long-legged mule.\r\n\r\nIt has been held by some of our officers, that the mule was a better\r\nanimal for Government service, because he required less care and feed\r\nthan the horse, and would go longer without water. This, again, is a\r\ngrave mistake. The mule, if properly taken care of, requires nearly as\r\nmuch forage as the horse, and should be groomed and cared for just the\r\nsame. I refer now to team animals. Such statements do a great deal of\r\ninjury, inasmuch as they encourage the men who have charge of animals to\r\nneglect and abuse them. The teamster who hears his superior talk in this\r\nway will soon take advantage of it. Animals of all kinds, in a wild and\r\nnatural state, have a way of keeping themselves clean. If left wild, the\r\nmule would do it. But when man deprives them of the privileges by tying\r\nthem up and domesticating them, he must assist them in the most natural\r\nway to keep themselves clean. And this assistance the animal appreciates\r\nto its fullest extent.\r\n\r\n_How to Handle a Mule Colt._--Owners and raisers of mules should pay\r\nmore attention to their habits when young. And I would give them this\r\nadvice: When the colt is six months old, put a halter on him and let the\r\nstrap hang loose. Let your strap be about four feet long, so that it\r\nwill drag on the ground. The animal will soon accustom himself to this;\r\nand when he has, take up the end and lead him to the place where you\r\nhave been accustomed to feed him. This will make him familiar with you,\r\nand increase his confidence. Handle his ears at times, but don't squeeze\r\nthem, for the ear is the most sensitive part of this animal. As soon as\r\nhe lets you handle his ears familiarly, put a loose bridle on him. Put\r\nit on and take it off frequently. In this way you will secure the colt's\r\nconfidence, and he will retain it until you need him for work.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the sensitiveness of the mule's ear, a scratch, or the\r\nslightest injury to it, will excite their stubbornness and make them\r\nafraid of you. I have known a mule's ear to be scratched by rough\r\nhandling, and for months afterward it was with the greatest difficulty\r\nyou could bridle him. Nothing is more important than that you should\r\nbridle a young mule properly. I have found from experience that the best\r\nway is this: stand on the near side, of course; take the top of the\r\nbridle in your right hand, and the bit in your left; pass your arm\r\ngently over his eye until that part of the arm bends his ear down, then\r\nslip the bit into his mouth, and at the same time let your hand be\r\nworking slowly with the bearings still on his head and neck, until you\r\nhave arranged the head-stall.\r\n\r\nIt would be a saving of thousands of dollars to the Government, if, in\r\npurchasing mules, it could get them all halter and bridle-broken.\r\nStablemen, in the employ of the Government, will not take the trouble to\r\nhalter and bridle-break them properly; and I have seen hundreds of\r\nmules, in the City of Washington, totally ruined by tying them up behind\r\nwagons while young, and literally dragging them through the streets.\r\nThese mules had never, perhaps, had a halter on before. I have seen\r\nthem, while tied in this manner, jump back, throw themselves down, and\r\nbe dragged on the ground until they were nearly dead. And what is worse,\r\nthe teamster invariably seeks to remedy this by beating them. In most\r\ncases, the teamster would see them dragged to death before he would give\r\nthem a helping hand. If he knew how to apply a proper remedy, very\r\nlikely he would not give himself the trouble to apply it. I have never\r\nbeen able to find out how this pernicious habit of tying mules behind\r\nwagons originated; but the sooner an order is issued putting a stop to\r\nit, the better, for it is nothing less than a costly torture. The mule,\r\nmore than any other animal, wants to see where he is going. He cannot do\r\nthis at the tail of an army wagon, though it is an excellent plan for\r\nhim to get his head bruised or his brains knocked out.\r\n\r\nSome persons charge it as an habitual vice with the mule to pull back. I\r\nhave seen horses contract that vice, and continue it until they killed\r\nthemselves. But, in all my experience with the mule, I never saw one in\r\nwhich it was a settled vice. During the time I had charge of the\r\nreceiving and issuing of horses to the army, I had a great many horses\r\ninjured seriously by this vice of pulling back. Some of these horses\r\nbecame so badly injured in the spine that I had to send them to the\r\nhospital, then under the charge of Dr. L.H. Braley. Some were so badly\r\ninjured that they died in fits; others were cured. Even when the mule\r\ngets his neck sore, he will endure it like the ox, and instead of\r\npulling back, as the horse will, he will come right up for the purpose\r\nof easing it. They do not, as some suppose, do this because of their\r\nsore, but because they are not sensitive like the horse.\r\n\r\n_Packing Mules_.--In looking over a copy of Mason's Farrier, or Stud\r\nBook, by Mr. Skinner, I find it stated that a mule is capable of packing\r\nsix or eight hundred pounds. Mr. Skinner has evidently never packed\r\nmules, or he would not have made so erroneous a statement. I have been\r\nin all our Northern and Western Territories, in Old and New Mexico,\r\nwhere nearly all the business is done by pack animals, mules, and asses;\r\nand I have also been among the tribes of Indians bordering on the\r\nMexican States, where they have to a great extent adopted the Spanish\r\nmethod of packing, and yet I never saw an instance when a mule could be\r\npacked six or eight hundred pounds. Indeed, the people in these\r\ncountries would ridicule such an assertion. And here I purpose to give\r\nthe result of my own experience in packing, together with that of\r\nseveral others who have long followed the business.\r\n\r\nI also purpose to say something on what I consider the best mode of\r\npacking, the weight suitable for each animal, and the relative gain or\r\nloss that might result from this method of transportation, as compared\r\nwith transportation by wagon. In the first place, packing ought never to\r\nbe resorted to, because it cannot be done with profit, where the roads\r\nare good and wagons and animals are to be had. In mountains, over\r\ndeserts and plains of sand, where forage is scant, and water only to be\r\nhad at long intervals, then the pack is a necessity, and can be used\r\nwith profit. Let it be understood, also, that in packing, the Spanish\r\npack-mule, as as well as saddle, is the most suitable. Second: The\r\nSpanish method of packing is, above all others, the most ancient, the\r\nbest and most economical. With it the animal can carry a heavier burden\r\nwith less injury to himself. Third: The weight to be packed, under ever\r\nso favorable circumstances, should never be over four hundred and fifty\r\npounds. Fourth: The American pack-saddle is a worthless thing, and\r\nshould never be used when any considerable amount of weight is required\r\nto be packed.\r\n\r\nIf I had previously entertained any doubt in regard to this American\r\npack-saddle, it was removed by what came under my observation three\r\nyears ago. While employed in the quartermasters' depot, at Washington,\r\nD.C., as superintendent of the General Hospital Stables, we at one time\r\nreceived three hundred mules, on which the experiment of packing with\r\nthis saddle had been tried in the Army of the Potomac. It was said this\r\nwas one of General Butterfield's experiments. These animals presented no\r\nevidence of being packed more than once; but such was the terrible\r\ncondition of their backs that the whole number required to be placed at\r\nonce under medical treatment. Officers of the army who knew Dr. Braley,\r\nknow how invariably successful he has been in the treatment of\r\nGovernment animals, and how carefully he treats them. Yet, in spite of\r\nall his skill, and with the best of shelter, fifteen of these animals\r\ndied from mortification of their wounds and injuries of the spine. The\r\nremainder were a very long time in recovering, and when they did, their\r\nbacks, in many cases, were scarred in such a manner as to render them\r\nunfit ever after for being used for a similar purpose. The use of the\r\nAmerican pack-saddle, and lack of knowledge on the part of those in\r\ncharge as to what mules were suitable for packing, did this. The\r\nexperienced packer would have seen at a glance that a large portion of\r\nthese mules were utterly unfit for the business. The experiment was a\r\nwretched failure, but cost the Government some thousands of dollars.\r\n\r\nI ought to mention, however, that the class of mules on which this\r\nexperiment was tried were loose, leggy animals, such as I have\r\nheretofore described as being almost unfit for any branch of Government\r\nservice. But, by all means, let the Government abandon the American\r\npack-saddle until some further improvements are made in it.\r\n\r\nNow, as to the weight a mule can pack. I have seen the Delaware Indians,\r\nwith all their effects packed on mules, going out on a buffalo hunt. I\r\nhave seen the Potawatamies, the Kickapoos, the Pawnees, the Cheyennes,\r\nPi-Ute, Sioux, Arapahoes, and indeed almost every tribe that use mules,\r\npack them to the very extent of their strength, and never yet saw the\r\nmule that could pack what Mr. Skinner asserts. More than that, I assert\r\nhere that you cannot find a mule that will pack even four hundred\r\npounds, and keep his condition sixty days. Eight hundred pounds, Mr.\r\nSkinner, is a trying weight for a horse to drag any distance. What,\r\nthen, must we think of it on the back of a mule? The officers of our\r\nquartermasters' department, who have been out on the plains, understand\r\nthis matter perfectly. Any of these gentlemen will tell you that there\r\nis not a pack train of fifty mules in existence, that can pack on an\r\naverage for forty days, three hundred pounds to the animal.\r\n\r\nI will now give you the experience of some of the best mule packers in\r\nthe country, in order to show that what has been written in regard to\r\nthe mule's strength is calculated to mislead the reader. In 1856,\r\nWilliam Anderson, a man whom I know well, packed from the City of Del\r\nNorte to Chihuahua and Durango, in Mexico, a distance of five hundred\r\nmiles or thereabout. Anderson and a man of the name of Frank Roberts had\r\ncharge of the pack train. They had seventy-five mules, and used to pack\r\nboxes of dry goods, bales, and even barrels. They had two Mexican\r\ndrivers, and travelled about fifteen miles a day, at most, though they\r\ntook the very best of care of their animals. Now, the very most it was\r\npossible for any mule in this train to get along with was two hundred\r\nand seventy-five pounds. More than this, they did not have over\r\ntwenty-five mules out of the whole number that could pack two hundred\r\nand fifty pounds, the average weight to the whole train being a little\r\nless than two hundred pounds. To make this fifteen miles a day, they had\r\nto make two drives, letting the animals stop to feed whenever they had\r\nmade seven or eight miles.\r\n\r\nIn 1858, this same Anderson packed for the expedition sent after the\r\nSnake Indians. His train consisted of some two hundred and fifty or\r\nthree hundred mules. They packed from Cordelaine Mission to Walla Walla,\r\nin Oregon. The animals were of a very superior kind, selected for the\r\npurpose of packing out of a very large lot. Some of the very best of\r\nthese mules were packed with three hundred pounds, but at the end of two\r\nweeks gave out completely.\r\n\r\nIn 1859, this same Anderson packed for a gentleman of the name of David\r\nReese, living at the Dalles, in Portland, Oregon. His train consisted of\r\nfifty mules, in good average condition, many of them weighing nine\r\nhundred and fifty pounds, and from thirteen to fourteen hands high. His\r\naverage packing was two hundred and fifty pounds. The distance was three\r\nhundred miles, and it occupied forty days in going and returning. Such\r\nwas the severity of the labor that nearly two-thirds of the animals\r\nbecame poor, and their backs so sore as to be unfit for work. This trip\r\nwas made from the Dalles, in Oregon, to Salmon Falls, on the Columbia\r\nRiver. Anderson asserts it, as the result of his experience, that, in\r\npacking fifty mules a distance of three hundred miles with two hundred\r\nand fifty pounds, the animals will be so reduced at the end of the\r\njourney as to require at least four weeks to bring them into condition\r\nagain. This also conforms with my own experience.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, there was started from Fort Laramie, Nebraska Territory, to go\r\nto Fort Bridger with salt, a train of forty mules. It was in the winter;\r\neach mule was packed with one hundred and eighty pounds, as near as we\r\ncould possibly estimate, and the train was given in charge of a man of\r\nthe name of Donovan. The weather and roads were bad, and the pack proved\r\nentirely too heavy. Donovan did all he could to get his train through,\r\nbut was forced to leave more than two-thirds of it on the way. At that\r\nseason of the year, when grass is poor and the weather bad, one hundred\r\nand forty or one hundred and fifty pounds is enough for any mule to\r\npack.\r\n\r\nThere were also, in 1857, regular pack trains run from Red Bluffs, on\r\nthe Sacramento River, in California, to Yreka and Curran River. Out of\r\nall the mules used in these trains, none were packed with over two\r\nhundred pounds. To sum up, packing never should be resorted to when\r\nthere is any other means of transportation open. It is, beyond doubt,\r\nthe most expensive means of transportation, even when the most\r\nexperienced packers are employed. If, however, it were necessary for the\r\nGovernment to establish a system of packing, it would be a great saving\r\nto import Mexicans, accustomed to the work, to perform the labor, and\r\nAmericans to take charge of the trains. Packing is a very laborious\r\nbusiness, and very few Americans either care about doing it, or have the\r\npatience necessary to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. PHYSICAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE MULE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI now propose to say something on the mule's limbs and feet. It will be\r\nobserved that the mule has a jack's leg from the knee down, and in this\r\npart of the leg he is weak; and with these he frequently has to carry a\r\nhorse's body. It stands to reason, then, that if you feed him until he\r\ngets two or three hundred pounds of extra flesh on him, as many persons\r\ndo, he will break down for want of leg-strength. Indeed, the mule is\r\nweakest where the horse is strongest. His feet, too, are a singular\r\nformation, differing very materially from those of the horse. The mule's\r\nfeet grow very slow, and the grain or pores of the hoof are much closer\r\nand harder than those of the horse. It is not so liable, however, to\r\nbreak or crumble. And yet they are not so well adapted for work on\r\nmacadamized or stony roads, and the more flesh you put on his body,\r\nafter a reasonable weight, the more you add to the means of his\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nObserve, for instance, a farmer's mule, or a poor man's mule working in\r\nthe city. These persons, with rare exceptions, feed their mules very\r\nlittle grain, and they are generally in low flesh. And yet they last a\r\nvery long time, notwithstanding the rough treatment they get. When you\r\nfeed a mule, you must adjust the proportions of his body to the strength\r\nof his limbs and the kind of service he is required to perform.\r\nExperience has taught me, that the less you feed a mule below what he\r\nwill eat clean, just that amount of value and life is kept out of him.\r\n\r\nIn relation to feeding animals. Some persons boast of having horses and\r\nmules that eat but little, and are therefore easily kept. Now, when I\r\nwant to get a horse or a mule, these small eaters are the last ones I\r\nwould think of purchasing. In nine cases out of ten, you will find such\r\nanimals out of condition. When I find animals in the Government's\r\npossession, that cannot eat the amount necessary to sustain them and\r\ngive them proper strength, I invariably throw them out, to be nursed\r\nuntil they will eat their rations. Animals, to be kept in good\r\ncondition, and fit for proper service, should eat their ten and twelve\r\nquarts of grain per head per day, with hay in proportion--say, twelve\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nI wish here again to correct a popular error, that the mule does not\r\neat, and requires much less food than the horse. My experience has been,\r\nthat a mule, twelve hands high, and weighing eight hundred pounds, will\r\neat and, indeed, requires just as much as a horse of similar dimensions.\r\nGive them similar work, keep then in a stable, or camp them out during\r\nthe winter months, and the mule will eat more than the horse will or\r\ncan. A mule, however, will eat almost any thing rather than starve.\r\nStraw, pine boards, the bark of trees, grain sacks, pieces of old\r\nleather, do not come amiss with him when he is hungry. There were many\r\ninstances, during the late war, where a team of mules were found, of a\r\nmorning, standing over the remains of what had, the evening before, been\r\na Government wagon. When two or more have been kept tied to a wagon,\r\nthey have been known to eat each other's tail off to the bone, And yet\r\nthe animal, thus deprived of his caudal appendage, did not evince much\r\npain.\r\n\r\nIn the South, many of the plantations are worked with mules, driven by\r\nnegroes. The mule seems to understand and appreciate the negro; and the\r\nnegro has a sort of fellow-feeling for the mule. Both are sluggish and\r\nstubborn, and yet they get along well together. The mule, too, is well\r\nsuited to plantation labor, and will outlast a horse at it. The soil is\r\nalso light and sandy, and better suited to the mule's feet. A negro has\r\nnot much sympathy for a work-horse, and in a short time will ruin him\r\nwith abuse, whereas he will share his corn with the mule. Nor does the\r\nworking of the soil on southern plantations overtax the power of the\r\nmule.\r\n\r\n_The Value of Harnessing properly_.--In working any animal, and more\r\nespecially the mule, it is both humane and economical to have him\r\nharnessed properly, Unless he be, the animal cannot perform the labor he\r\nis capable of with ease and comfort, And you cannot watch too closely to\r\nsee that every thing works in its right place. Begin with the bridle,\r\nand see that it does not chafe or cut him, The army blind-bridle, with\r\nthe bit alteration attached, is the very best bridle that can be used on\r\neither horse or mule. Be careful, however, that the crown-piece is not\r\nattached too tight. Be careful, also, that it does not draw the sides of\r\nthe animal's mouth up into wrinkles, for the bit, working against these,\r\nis sure to make the animal's mouth sore. The mule's mouth is a very\r\ndifficult part to heal, and once it gets sore he becomes unfit for work.\r\nYour bridle should be fitted well to the mule's head before you attempt\r\nto work him in it. Leave your bearing-line slack, so as to allow the\r\nmule the privilege of learning to walk easy with harness on. It is too\r\nfrequently the case, that the eyes of mules that are worked in the\r\nGovernment's service are injured by the blinds being allowed to work too\r\nclose to the eyes. This is caused by the blind-stay being too tight, or\r\nperhaps not split far enough up between the eyes and ears. This stay\r\nshould always be split high enough up to allow the blinds to stand at\r\nleast one inch and a half from the eye.\r\n\r\nAnother, and even more essential part of the harness is the collar. More\r\nmules are maimed and even ruined altogether by improperly fitting\r\ncollars, than is generally believed by quartermasters. It requires more\r\njudgment to fit a collar properly on a mule than it does to fit any\r\nother part of the harness. Get your collar long enough to buckle the\r\nstrap close up to the last hole. Then examine the bottom, and see that\r\nthere be room enough between the mule's neck or wind-pipe to lay your\r\nopen hand in easily. This will leave a space between the collar and the\r\nmule's neck of nearly two inches. Aside from the creased neck, mules'\r\nnecks are nearly all alike in shape, They indeed vary as little in neck\r\nas they do in feet; and what I say on the collar will apply to them all,\r\nThe teamster has always the means in his own hands of remedying a bad\r\nfitting collar. If the animal does not work easy in it, if it pinch him\r\nsomewhere, let it remain in water over night, put it on the animal wet\r\nthe next morning, and in a few minutes it will take the exact formation\r\nof the animal's neck. See that it is properly fitted above and below to\r\nthe hames, then the impression which the collar takes in a natural form\r\nwill be superior to the best mechanical skill of the best harness-maker.\r\n\r\nThere is another thing about collars, which, in my opinion, is very\r\nimportant. When you are pursuing a journey with teams of mules, where\r\nhay and grain are scarce, the animals will naturally become poor, and\r\ntheir necks get thin and small. If once the collar becomes too large,\r\nand you have no way of exchanging it for a smaller one, of course you\r\nmust do the next best thing you can. Now, first take the collar off the\r\nanimal, lay it on a level, and cut about one inch out of the centre.\r\nWhen you have done this, try it on the animal again; and if it still\r\ncontinues too large take a little more from each side of the centre\r\nuntil you get it right. In this way you can effect the remedy you need.\r\n\r\nIn performing a long journey, the animals will, if driven hard, soon\r\nshow you where the collar ought to be cut, They generally get sore on\r\nthe outer part of the shoulder, and this on account of the muscle\r\nwasting away. Teamsters on the plains and in the Western Territories cut\r\nall the collars when starting on a trip. It takes less time afterward to\r\nfit them to the teams, and to harness and unharness.\r\n\r\nWhen you find out where the collar has injured the shoulder, cut it and\r\ntake out enough of the stuffing to prevent the leather from touching the\r\nsore. In this way the animal will soon get sound-shouldered again. Let\r\nthe part of the leather you cut hang loose, so that when you take the\r\nstuffing out you may put it back and prevent any more than is actually\r\nnecessary from coming out.\r\n\r\nSee that your hames fit well, for they are a matter of great importance\r\nin a mule's drawing. Unless your hames fit your collar well, you are\r\nsure to have trouble with your harness, and your mule will work badly.\r\nSome persons think, because a mule can be accustomed to work with almost\r\nany thing for a harness, that money is saved in letting him do it. This\r\nis a great mistake. You serve the best economy when you harness him well\r\nand make his working comfortable. Indeed, a mule can do more work with a\r\nbad-fitting collar and harness than a man can walk with a bad-fitting\r\nboot. Try your hames on, and draw them tight enough at the top of the\r\nmule's neck, so that they will not work or roll round. They should be\r\ntight enough to fit well without pinching the neck or shoulder, and in\r\nfine, fit as neatly as a man's shirt-collar.\r\n\r\nDo not get the bulge part of your collar down too low. If you do, you\r\ninterfere with the machinery that propels the mule's fore legs. Again,\r\nif you raise it too high, you at once interfere with his wind. There is\r\nan exact place for the bulge of the collar, and it is on the point of\r\nthe mule's shoulder. Some persons use a pad made of sheepskin on the toe\r\nof the collar. Take it off, for it does no good, and get a piece of\r\nthick leather, free from wrinkles, ten or twelve inches long and seven\r\nwide; slit it crosswise an inch or so from each end, leaving about an\r\ninch in the centre. Fit this in, in place of the pad of sheepskin, and\r\nyou will have a cheaper, more durable, and cooler neck-gear for the\r\nanimal. You cannot keep a mule's neck in good condition with heating and\r\nquilted pads. The same is true of padded saddles. I have perhaps ridden\r\nas much as any other man in the service, of my age, and yet I never\r\ncould keep a horse's back in good condition with a padded saddle when I\r\nrode over twenty-five or thirty miles a day.\r\n\r\nThere is another evil which ought to be remedied. I refer now to the\r\nthroat-latch. Hundreds of mules are in a measure ruined by allowing the\r\nthroat-latch to be worked too tight. A tight throat-latch invariably\r\nmakes his head sore. Besides, it interferes with a part which, if it\r\nwere not for, you would not have the mule--his wind. I have frequently\r\nknown mules' heads so injured by the throat-latch that they would not\r\nallow you to bridle them, or indeed touch their heads. And to bridle a\r\nmule with a sore head requires a little more patience than nature\r\ngenerally supplies man with.\r\n\r\nLet a mule's ears alone. It is very common with teamsters and others,\r\nwhen they want to harness mules, to catch them by the ears, put twitches\r\non their ears. Even blacksmiths, who certainly ought to know better, are\r\nin the habit of putting tongs and twitches in their ears when they shoe\r\nthem. Now, against all these barbarous and inhuman practices, I here, in\r\nthe name of humanity, enter my protest. The animal becomes almost\r\nworthless by the injuries caused by such practices. There are extreme\r\ncases in which the twitch may be resorted to, but it should in all cases\r\nbe applied to the nose, and only then when all milder means have failed.\r\n\r\nBut there is another, and much better, method of handling and overcoming\r\nthe vices of refractory mules. I refer to the lariat. Throw the noose\r\nover the head of the unruly mule, then draw him carefully up to a wagon,\r\nas if for the purpose of bridling him. In case he is extremely hard to\r\nbridle, or vicious, throw an additional lariat or rope over his head,\r\nfixing it precisely as represented in the drawing. By this method you\r\ncan hold any mule. But even this method had better be avoided unless\r\nwhere it is absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nIt is now August, 1866. We are working five hundred and fifty-eight\r\nanimals, from six o'clock in the morning until seven o'clock at night,\r\nand out of this number we have not got ten sore or galled animals. The\r\nreason is, because we do not use a single padded saddle or collar. Also,\r\nthat the part of the harness that the heaviest strain comes on is kept\r\nas smooth and pliable as it is possible for it to be. Look well to your\r\ndrawing-chains, too, and see that they are kept of an even length. If\r\nyour collar gets gummy or dirty, don't scrape it with a knife; wash it,\r\nand preserve the smooth surface. Your breeching, or wheel harness, is\r\nalso another very important part; see that it does not cut and chafe the\r\nanimal so as to wear the hair off, or injure the skin. If you get this\r\ntoo tight, it is impossible for the animal to stretch out and walk free.\r\nBesides obstructing the animal's gait, however, the straps will hold the\r\ncollar and hames so tight to his shoulder as to make him sore on the top\r\nof his neck. These straps should always be slack enough to allow the\r\nmule perfect freedom when at his best walk.\r\n\r\nAnd now I have a few words to say on Government wagons. Government\r\nwagons, as now made, can be used for other purposes besides the army.\r\nThe large-sized Government wagon is, it has been proved, too heavy for\r\nfour horses. The smaller sized one is nearer right; but whenever you\r\ntake an ordinary load on it (the smaller one) and have a rough country\r\nto move through, it will give out. It is too heavy for two horses and a\r\nlight load, and yet not heavy enough to carry twenty-five hundred or\r\nthree thousand pounds, a four-horse load, when the roads are in any way\r\nbad. They do tolerably well about cities, established posts, and indeed\r\nanywhere where the roads are good, and they are not subject to much\r\nstrain. Improvements on the Government wagon have been attempted, but\r\nthe result has been failure. The more simple you can get such wagons,\r\nthe better, and this is why the original yet stands as the best. There\r\nis, however, great difference in the material used, and some makers make\r\nbetter wagons than others. The six and eight-mule wagon, the largest\r\nsize used for road and field purposes, is, in my humble opinion, the\r\nvery best adapted to the uses of our American army. During the rebellion\r\nthere were a great many wagons used that were not of the army pattern.\r\nOne of these, I remember, was called the Wheeling wagon, and used to a\r\ngreat extent for light work, and did well. On this account many persons\r\nrecommended them. I could not, and for this reason: they are too\r\ncomplicated, and they are much too light to carry the ordinary load of a\r\nsix-mule team. At the end of the war it was shown that the army pattern\r\nwagon had been worked more, had been repaired less, and was in better\r\ncondition than any other wagon used. I refer now to those made in\r\nPhiladelphia, by Wilson & Childs, or Wilson, Childs & Co. They are known\r\nin the army as the Wilson wagon. The very best place to test the\r\ndurability of a wagon is on the plains. Run it there, one summer, when\r\nthere is but little wet weather, where there are all kinds of roads to\r\ntravel on and loads to carry, and if it stands that it will stand any\r\nthing. The wagon-brake, instead of the lock-chain, is a great and very\r\nvaluable improvement made during the War. Having a brake on the wagon\r\nsaves the time and trouble of stopping at the top of every hill to lock\r\nthe wheels, and again at the bottom to unlock them. Officers of the army\r\nknow how much trouble this used to cause, how it used to block up the\r\nroads, and delay the movements of troops impatient to get ahead. The\r\nlock-chain ground out the wagon tire in one spot. The brake saves that;\r\nand it also saves the animal's neck from that bruising and chafing\r\nincident to the dead strain that was required when dragging the locked\r\nwheel.\r\n\r\nThere is another difficulty that has been overcome by the wagon-brake.\r\nIn stopping to lock wheels on the top of a hill, your train get into\r\ndisorder. In most cases, when trains are moving on the road, there is a\r\nspace of ten or fifteen feet between the wagons. Each team, then, will\r\nnaturally close up that space as it comes to the place for halting to\r\nlock. Now, about the time the first teamster gets his wheel locked, the\r\none in the rear of him is dismounting for the same purpose. This being\r\nrepeated along the train, it is not difficult to see how the space must\r\nincrease, and irregularity follow. The more wagons you have to lock with\r\nthe drag-chain, the further you get the teams apart. When you have a\r\nlarge body of wagons moving together, it naturally follows that, with\r\nsuch a halt as this, the teams in the rear must make twenty-five halts,\r\nor stops, and starts, for everyone that the head team makes.\r\n\r\nWhen the teamster driving the second team gets ready to lock, the first,\r\nor head team, starts up. This excites the mule of the second to do the\r\nsame, and so all along the train. This irritates the teamster, and he is\r\ncompelled to run up and catch the wheel-mules by the head, to make them\r\nstop, so that he can lock his wheels. In nine cases out of ten he will\r\nwaste time in punishing his animals for what they do not understand. He\r\nnever thinks for a moment that the mule is accustomed to start up when\r\nthe wagon ahead of him moves, and supposes he is doing his duty. In many\r\ncases, when he had got his wheels locked, he had so excited his mules\r\nthat they would run down the hill, cripple some of the men, break the\r\nwagon, cause a \"smash-up\" in the train, and perhaps destroy the very\r\nrations and clothes on which some poor soldier's life depended. We all\r\nknow what delay and disaster have resulted from the roads being blocked\r\nup in this manner. The brake, thanks to the inventor, offers a remedy\r\nfor all this. It also saves the neck and shoulders of every animal in\r\nthe train; it saves the feet of the wheelers; it saves the harness; it\r\nsaves the lead and swing mules from being stopped so quick that they cut\r\nthemselves; and it saves the wheels at least twenty per cent. Those who\r\nhave had wagons thrown over precipices, or labored and struggled in mud\r\nand water two and three hours at a time, can easily understand how time\r\nand trouble could have been saved if the wagon could have been locked in\r\nany way after it started over those places. The best brake by all odds,\r\nis that which fastens with a lever chain to the brake-bar. I do not like\r\nthose which attach with a rope, and for the reason that the lazy\r\nteamster can sit on the saddle-mule and lock and unlock, while, with the\r\nchain and lever, he must get off. In this way he relieves the\r\nsaddle-mule's back.\r\n\r\nWe all know that, in riding mules down steep or long hills, you do much\r\nto stiffen them up and wear them out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. SOMETHING MORE ABOUT BREEDING MULES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore I close this work, I desire to say something more about breeding\r\nmules. It has long been a popular error that to get a good mule colt you\r\nmust breed from large mares. The average sized, compact mare, is by all\r\nodds the superior animal to breed mules from. Experience has satisfied\r\nme that very large mules are about as useless for army service as very\r\nlarge men are for troopers. You can get no great amount of service out\r\nof either. One is good at destroying rations; the other at lowering\r\nhaystacks and corn-bins. Of all the number we had in the army, I never\r\nsaw six of these large, overgrown mules that were of much service.\r\nIndeed, I have yet to see the value in any animal that runs or rushes to\r\nan overgrowth. The same is true with man, beast, or vegetable. I will\r\nget the average size of either of them, and you will acknowledge the\r\nsuperiority.\r\n\r\nThe only advantage these large mares may give to the mule is in the size\r\nof the feet and bone that they may impart. The heavier you can get the\r\nbone and feet, the better. And yet you can rarely get even this, and for\r\nthe reason that I have before given, that the mare, in nineteen cases\r\nout of twenty, breeds close after the jack, more especially in the feet\r\nand legs. It makes little difference how you cross mares and jacks, the\r\nresult is almost certain to be a horse's body, a jack's legs and feet, a\r\njack's ears, and, in most cases, a jack's marks.\r\n\r\nNature has directed this crossing for the best, since the closer the\r\nmare breeds after the jack the better the mule. The highest marked\r\nmules, and the deepest of the different colors, I have invariably found\r\nto be the best. What is it, let us inquire, that makes the Mexican mule\r\nhardy, trim, robust, well-marked after the jack, and so serviceable? It\r\nis nothing more nor less than breeding from sound, serviceable, compact,\r\nand spirited Mexican or mustang mares. You must, in fact, use the same\r\njudgment in crossing these animals as you would if you wanted to produce\r\na good race or trotting horse.\r\n\r\nWe are told, in Mason and Skinner's Stud Book, that in breeding mules\r\nthe mares should be large barrelled small limbed, with a moderate-sized\r\nhead and a good forehead. This, it seems to me, will strike our officers\r\nas a very novel recommendation. The mule's limbs and feet are the\r\nidentical parts you want as large as possible, as everyone that has had\r\nmuch to do with the animal knows. You rarely find a mule that has legs\r\nas large as a horse. But the mule, from having a horse's body, will\r\nfatten and fill up, and become just as heavy as the body of an\r\naverage-sized horse. Having, then, to carry this extra amount of fat and\r\nflesh on the slender legs and feet of a jackass, you can easily see what\r\nthe result must be. No; you will be perfectly safe in getting your mule\r\nas large-legged as you can. And by all means let the mare you breed from\r\nhave a good, sound, healthy block of a foot. Then the colt will stand\r\nsome chance of inheriting a portion of it. It is natural that the larger\r\nyou get his feet the steadier he will travel. Some persons will tell you\r\nthat these small feet are natural, and are best adapted to the animal.\r\nBut they forget that the mule is not a natural animal, only an invention\r\nof man. Let your mare and jack be each of the average size, the jack\r\nwell marked, and No. 1 of his kind, and I will take the product and wear\r\nout any other style of breed. Indeed, you have only to appeal to your\r\nbetter judgment to convince you as to what would result from putting a\r\njack, seven or eight hands high, to a mare of sixteen or more.\r\n\r\nI have witnessed some curious results in mule breeding, and which it may\r\nbe well enough to mention here. I have seen frequent instances where one\r\nof the very best jacks in the country had been put to mares of good\r\nquality and spirit. Putting them to such contemptible animals seemed to\r\ndegrade them, to destroy their natural will and temper. The result was a\r\nsort of bastard mule, a small-legged, small-footed, cowardly animal,\r\ninheriting all the vices of the mule and none of the horse's virtues--\r\nthe very meanest of his kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. ANCIENT HISTORY OF THE MULE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mule seems to have been used by the ancients in a great variety of\r\nways; but what should have prompted his production must for ever remain\r\na mystery. That they early discovered his great usefulness in making\r\nlong journeys, climbing mountains, and crossing deserts of burnings and,\r\nwhen subsistence and water were scarce, and horses would have perished,\r\nis well established. That he would soon recover from the severe effects\r\nof these long and trying journeys must also have been of great value in\r\ntheir eyes. But however much they valued him for his usefulness, they\r\nseem not to have had the slightest veneration for him, as they had for\r\nsome other animals. I am led to believe, then, that it was his great\r\nusefulness in crossing the sandy deserts that led to his production. It\r\nis a proof, also, that where the ass was at hand there also was the\r\nhorse, or the mule could not have been produced. Any people with\r\nsufficient knowledge to produce the mule would also have had sufficient\r\nknowledge to discover the difference between him and the horse, and\r\nwould have given the preference to the horse in all service except that\r\nI have just described. And yet, in the early history of the world, we\r\nfind men of rank, and even rulers, using them on state and similar\r\noccasions; and this when it might have been supposed that the horse,\r\nbeing the nobler animal, would have made more display.\r\n\r\nThe Scriptures tell us that Absalom, when he led the rebel hosts against\r\nhis father David, rode on a mule, that he rode under an oak, and hung\r\nhimself by the hair of his head. Then, again, we hear of the mule at the\r\ninauguration of King Solomon. It is but reasonable to suppose that the\r\nhorse would have been used on that great occasion, had he been present.\r\nOn the other hand, it is not reasonable to suppose that the ass, or any\r\nthing pertaining to him, was held in high esteem by a nation that\r\nbelieved they were commanded by God, through their prophet Moses, not to\r\nwork the ox and the ass together. It must be inferred from this that the\r\nass was not held in very high esteem, and that the prohibition was for\r\nthe purpose of not degrading the ox, he being of that family of which\r\nthe perfect males were used for sacrifice. The ass, of course, was never\r\nallowed to appear on the sacred altar. And yet He who came to save our\r\nfallen race, and open the gates of heaven, and fulfil the words of the\r\nprophet, rode a female of this apparently degraded race of animals when\r\nHe made his triumphal march into the city of the temple of the living\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n\r\nList of Mules Received, died, and Shot, at the Depot of Washington,\r\nD.C., from 1st February, 1863. to 31st July, 1866.\r\n\r\n                1863                1864                1865\r\n\r\nMonth  Received Died  Shot Received Died  Shot Received Died  Shot\r\n\r\nJan.      ..     ..    ..      624   14    76   3,677    66    226\r\nFeb.     135     96     7      329   16    62   1,603    84    150\r\nMar.   2,552    150     4      448   10    64   2,823    77    169\r\nApr.   2,906    118    61    1,305   15    47   6,102   106    223\r\nMay.   1,087     56    46    2,440   18    52  11,780    68    211\r\nJun.   3,848    120   118    4,410   76    48  19,304   178     49\r\nJul.   1,731     94   335    4,702   74   125  13,398   462     68\r\nAug.   5,250     51   159    5,431   88   231   1,275   284     23\r\nSep.   2,834     72   248    1,198   64   176   1,536     3     18\r\nOct.   1,166     36   202    1,468   81   134     876    ..     ..\r\nNov.   2,934     30   204    3,036   35   123     252     3     ..\r\nDec.   2,832     14   113    3,923   66   158     324     4     ..\r\n\r\nTotal 27,275    837 1,497   29,414  557 1,296  62,950 1,335  1,137\r\n\r\n         1866\r\nReceived Died Shot\r\n\r\n  169     ..    ..\r\n   34      2     1\r\n   13     ..    ..\r\n   29      1    ..\r\n   20      1    ..\r\n    2     ..    ..\r\n   62     ..    ..\r\n   ..     ..    ..\r\n   ..     ..    ..\r\n   ..     ..    ..\r\n   ..     ..    ..\r\n   ..     ..    ..\r\n\r\n  329      4     1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDATE                RECEIVED     DIED     SHOT\r\n1863.............     27,275      837    1,497\r\n1864.............     29,414      557    1,296\r\n1865..............    62,950    1,335    1,137\r\n1866..............       329        4        1\r\n\r\nTotal...........     119,968    2,733    3,931\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPICTURES OF SOME OF OUR MOST CELEBRATED ARMY MULES.\r\n\r\nI have had photographs taken of some of our mules. A number of these\r\nanimals performed extraordinary service in connection with the Army of\r\nthe Potomac and the Western Army. One of them, a remarkable animal, made\r\nthe great circuit of Sherman's campaign, and has an historical interest.\r\nI propose to give you these illustrations according to their numbers.\r\n\r\nNo.1, then, is a very remarkable six-mule team. It was fitted out at\r\nBerryville, Maryland, early in the spring of 1861, under the directions\r\nof Captain Sawtelle, A. Q. M. They are all small, compact mules, and I\r\nhad them photographed in order to show them together. The leaders and\r\nswing, or, as some call them, the middle leaders, have been worked\r\nsteadily together in the same team since December 31, 1861. They have\r\nalso been driven by the same driver, a colored man, of the name of\r\nEdward Wesley Williams. He was with Captain Sawtelle until the 1st of\r\nMarch, 1862; was then transferred, with his team, to the City of\r\nWashington, and placed under a wagon-master of the name of Horn, who\r\nbelonged to Harrisburg, Pa. Wesley took good care of his team, and was\r\nkept at constant work with it in Washington, until May 14, 1862. He was\r\nthen transferred, with his team, to a train that was ordered to join\r\nGeneral McClellan at Fort Monroe. He then followed the fortunes of the\r\nArmy of the Potomac up the Peninsula; was at the siege of Yorktown, the\r\nbattle of Williamsburg, and in the swamps of the Chickahominy. He was\r\nalso in the seven days' battles, and brought up at Harrison's Landing\r\nwith the Army of the Potomac. He then drove his team back to Fort\r\nMonroe, where they were shipped, with the animals of the Army of the\r\nPotomac, for Washington. He was set to work as soon as he reached a\r\nlanding, and participated in hauling ammunition at the second battle of\r\nBull Run. He then followed the army to Antietam, and from that\r\nbattle-field to Fredericksburg, where he hauled ammunition during the\r\nterrible disaster under General Burnside. The team then belonged to a\r\ntrain of which John Dorny was wagon-master. When General Hooker took\r\ncommand of the army this team followed him through the Chancellorville\r\nand Chantilly fights. It also followed the Army of the Potomac until\r\nGeneral Grant took command, when the train it belonged to was sent to\r\nCity Point. This brings us up to 1864. It was with the army in front of\r\nPetersburg, and, during that winter, the saddle mule was killed by the\r\nenemy's shot while the team was going for a load of wood. In short, they\r\nwere worked every day until Richmond was taken. In June, 1865, they were\r\ntransferred back to the City of Washington. It is now August, 1866, and\r\nthey are still working in the train, and make one of the very best teams\r\nwe have. I refer now to the leaders and swing mules, as they are the\r\nonly four that are together, and that followed the Army of the Potomac\r\nthrough all its campaigns. There is not a mule of the four that is over\r\nfourteen and a half hands high, and not one that weighs over nine\r\nhundred pounds. This team, I ought to add here, has frequently been\r\nwithout a bite of hay or grain for four or five days, and nothing to eat\r\nbut what they could pick up along the road. And there are instances when\r\nthey have been twenty-four hours without a sup of water. The experienced\r\neye will see that they have round, compact bodies, and stand well on\r\ntheir feet.\r\n\r\nNo. 2 is the leader of the team, and for light work on the prairies,\r\npacking, or any similar work, is a model mule. Indeed, she cannot be\r\nsurpassed. Her bone and muscle is full, and she is not inclined to run\r\nto flesh.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 is the off-leader of the same team. She is a good eater, tough,\r\nhardy, and a good worker,--in every way a first-class mule. I would\r\nadvise persons purchasing mules to notice her form. She is a little\r\nsprung in the knees; but this has in no way interfered with her working.\r\nThis was occasioned by allowing the heels on her fore-feet to grow out\r\ntoo much. During, and for some time after, the second battle of Bull\r\nRun, the train to which she belonged was kept at very hard work. The\r\nshoes that were on her at that time, to use the driver's own language,\r\nwere \"put on to stay.\" Indeed, he informed me that they were on so long,\r\nthat he concluded they had grown to the feet. And in this case, as in\r\nmany others, for want of a little knowledge of the peculiarities of a\r\nmule's feet, and the injury that results from over-growth, the animal\r\nhad to suffer, and was permanently injured.\r\n\r\nNo. 4 is the off-swing, or middle-leader mule. She is perfectly sound,\r\nof good height, a good eater, and a great worker. She is also well\r\nadapted for packing, and a tolerably good rider. Her ears and eyes are\r\nof the very finest kind, and her whole head indicates intelligence. Her\r\nfront parts are perfection itself. She is also remarkably kind.\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATION 1\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATION 2\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATION 3\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATION 4\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATION 5\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATION 6\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATION 7\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATION 8\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATION 9\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATION 10\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATION 11\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATION 12\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATION 13\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATION 14\r\n\r\nNo. 5 is the near swing mule, or middle leader. She is what is called a\r\nmouse-color, and is the fattest mule in the team. She underwent the\r\nentire campaigns of the Army of the Potomac, and is to-day without a\r\nblemish, and capable of doing as much work as any mule in the pack. Her\r\npowers of endurance, as well as her ability to withstand starvation and\r\nabuse, are beyond description. I have had mules of her build with me in\r\ntrains, in the Western Territories, that endured hardship and starvation\r\nto an extent almost incredible; and yet they were remarkably kind when\r\nwell treated, and would follow me like dogs, and, indeed, try to show me\r\nhow much they could endure without flinching.\r\n\r\nNo. 6 is an off-wheel mule, of ordinary quality. I had to take the\r\nspotted mules from the wheels of this team, as they were not equal to\r\nthe work required of them, and got very sore in front.\r\n\r\nNo. 7 is a spotted, or, as the. Mexicans call them, a calico mule. He\r\nand his mate were sent to the Army of the Potomac about the time General\r\nGrant took command of it. They were worked as wheel mules in the team\r\nuntil 1866, when this one, like nearly all spotted animals, showed his\r\nweak parts by letting up in his fore-feet, which became contracted to\r\nsuch an extent that the surgeon had to cut them nearly off. We were\r\ncompelled to let him go barefoot until they grew out. This is one of the\r\nspotted mules I have referred to before. You never can rely on them.\r\n\r\nNo. 8 is the mate of No. 7. His bead, ears, and front shoulder indicate\r\nhim to be of Canadian stock. His neck and front shoulder, as you will\r\nsee, are faultless. But on looking closely at his eyes you will find\r\nthem to be sore, and running water continually. I have noticed that\r\nnearly all animals in the army that are marked in this way have weak and\r\ninflamed eyes. A farmer should never purchase them.\r\n\r\nNo. 9 is a swing mule that has undergone a great deal of hardship. She\r\nis tolerably well formed but inclined to kick. She is also hard to keep\r\nin good condition, and unless great care is taken with her she would\r\ngive out in the hind feet, where she now shows considerable fullness.\r\nWhen a mule's neck lacks the ordinary thickness there must be some\r\ndirect cause for it, and you should set about finding out what it is.\r\nLack of food is sometimes the cause. But in my opinion creased neck very\r\nfrequently so affects the passages to and from the head, that the organs\r\nthat should work in depositing flesh, fat, or muscle become deranged,\r\nand the neck becomes weak and in a disordered state. Purchasers would do\r\nwell to discard these creased-neck mules.\r\n\r\nNo. 10 is an animal of an entirely different character from No. 9. She\r\nis remarkably gentle and tractable, of good form, and great endurance,\r\nand will work in any way. She is fifteen hands and one inch high, weighs\r\nten hundred and fifty pounds, and is seven years old. This celebrated\r\nanimal went through all of General Sherman's campaigns, and is as sound\r\nand active to-day as a four-year old.\r\n\r\nNo. 11 is one of those peculiar animals I have described elsewhere. He\r\nis all bones and belly. His legs are long, and of little use as legs. He\r\nis five years old, sixteen and a half hands high, and weighs thirteen\r\nhundred and ninety pounds. One of his hind legs shows a thorough pin.\r\nHis hocks are all out of shape, and his legs are stuck into his hoofs on\r\nnearly the same principle that you stick a post into the ground. The\r\nreason why his pastern-joints show so straight is, that the heels on the\r\nhind feet have been badly trimmed when shaving. They too have been\r\npermitted to grow too long, and thus he is thrown into the position you\r\nnow see him. This mule belongs to a class that is raised to a\r\nconsiderable extent, and prized very highly in Pennsylvania. In the army\r\nthey were of very little use except to devour forage.\r\n\r\nNo. 12 is what may be called a pack mule of the first class. He is seven\r\nyears old, fifteen and a half hands high, and weighs eleven hundred and\r\nfifty-six pounds. This animal has endured almost incredible hardships.\r\nHe is made for it, as you will readily see. He is what is called a\r\nportly mule, but is not inclined to run to belly unless over-fed and not\r\nworked. He has a remarkably kind disposition, is healthy, and a good\r\nfeeder. This animal has but one evil to contend with. His off hind foot\r\nhas grown too long, and plainly shows how much too far back it throws\r\nthe pastern-joint. This is in a measure the effect of bad shoeing. It is\r\nvery rare to find a blacksmith who discovers this fact until it is too\r\nlate. Now there is nothing more easy than to ruin a mule by letting his\r\ntoes grow too long. Doctor L.H. Braley, chief veterinary surgeon of the\r\narmy, is now developing a plan for shoeing mules, which I consider the\r\nvery best that has been suggested. His treatment of the foot when well,\r\nand how to keep it so; and how to treat the foot by shoeing when it\r\nbecomes injured, is the best that can be adopted.\r\n\r\nNo. 13 is a mule that has been worked in a two-mule train which has been\r\nin my charge for about a year. She was previously worked in a six-mule\r\ntrain, as the off-wheel mule. She is five years old, rising; size,\r\nfifteen hands and three inches high, and weighs fourteen hundred and\r\ntwenty-two pounds. She was received into the Government service at\r\nWheeling, Virginia, and when shipped or transferred to this depot, with\r\nfour hundred others, was but two years old, rising three. She was\r\nworked, at least a year or more, too young; and to this cause I\r\nattribute certain injuries which I shall speak of hereafter. This mule,\r\nwith two hundred others, was transferred to the Army of the Potomac, and\r\nwent through its campaigns from 1864 up to the fall of Richmond. She is\r\nan excellent worker, and her neck, head, and fore shoulders are as fine\r\nas can be. Indeed, they are a perfect development of the horse. But her\r\nhips or flank joints are very deficient. Owing to her being worked too\r\nyoung, the muscles of the hind legs have given way, and they have become\r\ncrooked. This is done frequently by the animal being placed as a wheeler\r\nwhen too young, and holding back under a heavy load. If you want to see\r\nhow quick you can ruin young mules, place them in the wheels.\r\n\r\nNo. 14 is the off-wheel mule of a six-mule team. I had this mule\r\nphotographed for the purpose of showing the effects of hitching animals\r\nso short to the team that the swingle-tree will strike or rest on their\r\nhocks. I referred to this great evil in another place. This mule is but\r\nsix years old, sixteen hands high, and weighs nearly sixteen hundred\r\npounds. Aside from the hocks, she is the best made and the best looking\r\nmule in the park; and is also a remarkably good worker. You will notice,\r\nhowever, that the caps of her hocks are so swollen and calloused by the\r\naction of the swingle-tree as to make them permanently disfigured. The\r\nposition I have placed this mule in, as relates to the wagon wheel, is\r\nthe proper position to put all wild, green, contrary or stubborn mules\r\nin when they are hard to bridle.\r\n\r\nThis is the severest use to which a lariat can be put on mule or horse.\r\nThe person using it, however, should be careful to see that it sets well\r\nback to the shoulder of the animal. I refer now to the part of the loop\r\nthat is around the neck. The end of the lariat should always be held by\r\na man, and not made fast to any part of the wagon, so that if the animal\r\nfalls or throws himself, you can slack up the lariat and save him from\r\ninjury. Three applications of the buck will conquer them so thoroughly\r\nthat you will have little trouble afterwards. Be careful to keep the\r\nlariat, in front, as high as the mule's breast; and see also that they\r\nare pulled up close to the front wheel before pulling it through the\r\nhind wheel.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES COMMON TO THE MULE, AND HOW THEY SHOULD BE TREATED.\r\n\r\nThe mule does not differ materially from the horse in the diseases he is\r\nafflicted with. He however suffers less from them, owing to lack of\r\nsensibility. It may be useful here to make a few remarks on the various\r\ndiseases he is subject to, and to recommend a course of treatment which\r\nI have practiced and seen practiced, and which I believe is the best\r\nthat can be applied.\r\n\r\nDISTEMPER IN COLTS.\r\n\r\nThis disease is peculiar to young mules. Its symptoms develop with\r\nsoreness and swelling of the glands of the throat, a cough, difficulty\r\nof swallowing, discharging at the nostrils, and general prostration. If\r\nnot properly treated it is surely fatal.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:--Give light bran mashes, plenty of common salt, and keep the\r\nanimal in a warm and dry stable. You need not clothe, for the mule,\r\nunlike the horse, is not used to clothing. If the swelling under the\r\nthroat shows a disposition to ulcerate, which it generally does, do\r\nnothing to prevent it. Encourage the ulcer, and let it come to a head\r\ngradually, for this is the easiest and most natural way that the\r\ntrouble, which at first seems to pervade the whole system, can be got\r\nrid of. When the ulcer appears soft enough to lance, do so, and be\r\ncareful to avoid the glands and veins. Lance through the skin in the\r\nsoft spot, which appears almost ready to break. If the throat is at any\r\ntime so swollen as to render swallowing difficult, give water\r\nfrequently, about milk warm, with nourishing feed of oats, corn, or rye\r\nmeal--the last is the best. If this treatment, which is very simple, be\r\ncarefully carried out, few animals will fail to recover.\r\n\r\nCATARRH OR COLDS.\r\n\r\nThis disease seldom attacks the mule. We have had many thousands of them\r\nin camp, and out of the whole number, I do not recollect of a case where\r\nit either destroyed or disabled a single animal. In fact, it is a\r\nquestion with me whether mules will take cold when kept as the\r\nGovernment keeps them--camped out, or standing in sheds where the\r\ntemperature is the same as outdoors.\r\n\r\nGLANDERS.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most destructive of diseases with which the horse\r\nfamily is afflicted, and one that has set the best veterinary skill of\r\nthe world at defiance. A remedy for it has yet to be discovered. I have\r\ndeemed it proper here, however, to carefully describe its symptoms, and\r\nto recommend that all animals showing symptoms of it be kept by\r\nthemselves until their case be definitely ascertained. When you have\r\nascertained to a certainty that they are afflicted with the disease,\r\ndestroy them as quick as possible. See, too, that the place where they\r\nhave been kept is thoroughly cleansed and sprinkled with lime, for the\r\ndisease is contagious and the slightest particle of virus will spread it\r\nanew. Farcy is but one stage of this terrible disease, but is not\r\nnecessarily fatal while in this stage. It should, however, be treated\r\nwith great care and caution. Farcy can also be conveyed to others by\r\ninoculation. Any one who has had the field for observation the author\r\nhas for the last four years, would become convinced that the\r\nrecommendations I am about to make describe the only course to be taken\r\nwith this contagious disease. The number of its victims under my\r\nobservation were counted by thousands. All that can be done is to\r\nprevent, if possible, the disease taking place, and to destroy when\r\nascertained to a certainty that the animal has contracted it. I would\r\nsay here, however, that this subject will soon be thoroughly handled in\r\na work soon to be published by Doctor Braley, head veterinary surgeon of\r\nthe army. He will undoubtedly throw some light on the subject that has\r\nnot yet appeared in print.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.\r\n\r\nFirst:--When it appears in a natural form, without the agency of\r\ncontagion or inoculation, dryness of the skin, entire omission of\r\ninsensible perspiration, starring of the coat. Sometimes slight\r\ndiscoloring can be observed about the forehead and lower part of the\r\nears. Drowsiness, want of lustre in the eye, slight swelling on the\r\ninside of the hind legs, extending up to the bu-boa. This condition of\r\nthings may continue for several days, and will be followed by\r\nenlargement between the legs. The inflammation incident to this may\r\nentirely subside, or it may continue to enlarge, and break out in ulcers\r\non the _lactiles_ of the lymphatic, which accompanies the large veins.\r\nIn the last case it has appeared in the form of Farcy. This being the\r\ncase, the countenance assumes a more cheerful look, and the animal\r\notherwise shows signs of relief from the discharges of poisonous matter.\r\nIf it remain in this state, death is not generally the result. If the\r\nsystem be toned up it will sometimes heal, and the animal will seem to\r\nbe in a recovering state of health. Yet, from watching the symptoms and\r\ngeneral health of the animal afterwards, you will be convinced that the\r\ndisease is only checked, not eradicated. Acting in the system, it only\r\nwaits a favorable opportunity to act as a secondary agent in colds,\r\ngeneral debility, or exposure, when it will make its appearance and\r\nproduce death.\r\n\r\nBut in the first case, as shown by the swelling in the hind legs, if the\r\nswelling disappear, and general debility of the system continues; if the\r\neyes grow more drowsy, and discharge from the lower corners; and if this\r\nis followed by discharge from the nostrils, slight swelling and\r\nhardening of the sub-maxillary glands, which are between the under jaws,\r\nthen it is clearly developed glanders. All the glands in the body have\r\nnow become involved or poisoned, and death must follow in the course of\r\nten or fifteen days, as the constitution of the animal may not be in a\r\ncondition to combat the disease.\r\n\r\nIf this disease be annoyed by inoculation from the _farcy heads_ of\r\nfarcied animals into suppurating sores on other animals, it will be very\r\nslow in its progress, especially if it attack the other in a region\r\nremote from the lymphatic. If in a saddle-gall, it will make sores very\r\ndifficult to heal. If there is any such thing as checking the disease in\r\nits progress, it is in these three cases.\r\n\r\nI have observed that when it has been taken in a sore mouth it has\r\nfollowed down the cheek to the sub-maxillary gland, and ended in a clear\r\ncase of glanders or farcy. There is another form in which this disease\r\ncan be taken, and which is, of all others, the most treacherous and\r\ndangerous, yet never producing death without the agency of other\r\ndiseases--always carrying with it the germs of infection, and ready to\r\nconvey it to debilitated subjects and cause their death. The animal will\r\nstill live himself, and show no sign of disease further than I am about\r\nto describe in the position. It is that which is taken in at the\r\nnostrils and attacks the sub-maxillary glands, which become enlarged and\r\nwill remain so. When these become overloaded there will be a discharge\r\nat the nose. That being thrown off, it may be some time before any\r\nfurther discharge will be seen from the same source. In some cases, when\r\nthe discharge is constant, this can be easily distinguished from gleet\r\nor ozena, from the healthy and natural appearance of the membranes of\r\nthe nose, which at first are pale, then become fiery red or purple. In\r\ngleet the discharges from the nostrils, as in ozena, are of a very light\r\ncolor. In glanders they are first of a deep yellow, then of a dirty\r\ngray--almost slate color.\r\n\r\nMules affected with glanders of this kind, although it may seem hard\r\nfrom their otherwise healthy appearance, should be destroyed. They\r\nindeed carry with them the germs of infection and death, without any\r\nvisible marks in their appearance to warn those who have the care of\r\nanimals against their danger.\r\n\r\nTEETHING.\r\n\r\nAs mules seldom change hands to any great extent until two or three\r\nyears old, it is not deemed necessary here to say any thing of their age\r\nuntil they have reached two years, so as to give the inexperienced a\r\nwider scope. The mule's mouth undergoes exactly the same changes as the\r\nhorse's. Between the ages of two and three these changes begin to take\r\nplace in the mule's mouth. The front incisor teeth, two above and two\r\nbelow, are replaced by the horse for permanent teeth. These teeth are\r\nlarger than the others, have two grooves in the outer converse surface,\r\nand the mark is long, narrow, deep, and black. Not having attained their\r\nfull growth, they are somewhat lower than the others, the mark in the\r\ntwo next nippers being nearly worn out, and is also wearing away in the\r\ncorner nippers.\r\n\r\nA mule at three years old ought to have the central permanent nippers\r\ngrowing, the other two pairs uniting, six grinders in each jaw, above\r\nand below, the first and fifth level with the others, and the sixth\r\nprotruding. As the permanent nippers wear and continue to grow, a narrow\r\nportion of the cone-shaped tooth is exposed to the attrition; and they\r\nlook as if they had been compressed. This is not so, however; the mark\r\nof some gradually disappears as the pit is worn away. At the age of\r\nthree and a half or four years the next pair of nippers will be changed,\r\nand the mouth at that time cannot be mistaken. The central nippers will\r\nhave nearly attained their full growth, and a vacuity will be left where\r\nthe second stood; or, they will begin to peep above the gum, and the\r\ncorner ones will be diminished in breadth and worn down, the mark\r\nbecoming small and faint. At this period also the second pair of\r\ngrinders will be shed. At four years the central nippers will be fully\r\ndeveloped, the sharp edges somewhat worn off, and the marks shorter,\r\nwider, and fainter. The next pair will be up, but they will be small,\r\nwith the mark deep and extending quite across. Their corner nippers will\r\nbe larger than the inside ones, yet smaller than they were, and flat,\r\nand nearly worn out. The sixth grinder will have risen to a level with\r\nthe others; and the tushes will begin to appear in the male animal. The\r\nfemale seldom has them, although the germ is always present in the jaw.\r\nAt four years and a half, or between that and five, the last important\r\nchange takes place in the mouth of the mule. The corner nippers are\r\nshed, and the permanent ones begin to appear. When the central nippers\r\nare considerably worn, and the next pair are showing marks of wear, the\r\ntush will have protruded, and will generally be a full half inch in\r\nheight. Externally it has a rounded prominence, with a groove on either\r\nside, and is evidently hollow within. At six years old the mark on the\r\ncentral nippers is worn out. There will, however, still be a difference\r\nof color in the center of the tooth. The cement filling up the hole made\r\nby the dipping in of the enamel, will present a browner hue than the\r\nother part of the tooth. It will be surrounded by an edge of enamel, and\r\nthere will remain a little depression in the center, and also a\r\ndepression around the case of the enamel. But the deep hole in the\r\ncenter of the enamel, with the blackened surface it presents, and the\r\nelevated edge of the enamel, will have disappeared. The mule may now be\r\nsaid to have a perfect mouth, all the teeth being produced and fully\r\ngrown.\r\n\r\nWhat I have said above must not be taken as a positive guide in all\r\ncases, for mules' mouths are frequently torn, twisted, smashed, and\r\nknocked into all kinds of shapes by cruel treatment, and the\r\ninexperience, to use no harsher term, of those who have charge of them.\r\nIndeed, I have known cases of cruelty so severe that it were impossible\r\nto tell the age of the animal from his teeth.\r\n\r\nAt seven years old the mark, in the way in which I have described it, is\r\nworn out in the four central nippers, and is also fast wearing away in\r\nthe corner teeth. I refer now to a natural mouth that has not been\r\nsubjected to injuries. At eight years old the mark is gone from all the\r\nbottom nippers, and may be said to be quite out of the mouth. There is\r\nnothing remaining in the bottom nippers by which the age of the mule can\r\nbe positively ascertained. The tushes are a poor guide at any time in\r\nthe life of the animal to ascertain his age by; they, more than any\r\nother of the teeth, being most exposed to the injuries I have referred\r\nto. From this time forward, the changes that take place in the teeth may\r\nbe of some assistance in forming an opinion; but there are no marks in\r\nthe teeth by which a year, more or less, can be positively ascertained.\r\nYou can ascertain almost as much from the general appearance of the\r\nanimal as from an examination of the mouth. The mule, if he be\r\nlong-lived, has the same effect in changing his general appearance from\r\nyouth to old age as is shown on the rest of the animal creation.\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE TEETH.\r\n\r\nThere are few if any diseases to which the mule's teeth are subject,\r\nafter the permanent teeth are developed; but during the time of their\r\nchanges I have been led to believe that he suffers more inconvenience,\r\nor at least as much as any other animal--not so much on account of the\r\nsuffering that nature inflicts upon him, as through the inexperience and\r\ncruelty of those who are generally intrusted with his care. I will here\r\nspeak first of lampass. The animal's mouth is made sore and sensitive by\r\nteething; and this irritation and soreness is increased by the use of\r\nimproper bits. As if this were not enough, resort is had to that\r\nbarbarous and inhuman practice of burning out lampass. This I do, and\r\nalways have protested against. If the gums are swollen from the cutting\r\nof teeth, which is about all the cause for their inflamed and enlarged\r\nappearance, a light stroke of a lancet or sharp knife over the gums, at\r\na point where the teeth are forcing their way through, and a little\r\nregard to the animal's diet, will be all that is necessary. It must not\r\nbe forgotten, that at this time the animal's mouth is too sore and\r\nsensitive to masticate hard food, such as corn. With the development of\r\nthe teeth, however, the lampass will generally disappear.\r\n\r\nTHE EYE.\r\n\r\nMules are remarkable for having good eyes. Occasionally they become\r\ninflamed and sore. In such cases the application of cold water, and the\r\nremoving of the cause, whether it be from chafing of the blinders,\r\nforcing the blood to the head through the influence of badly fitting\r\ncollars, or any other cause known, is all I can recommend in their case.\r\n\r\nTHE TONGUE.\r\n\r\nMules suffer much from injury to the tongue, caused by the bad treatment\r\nof those who have charge of them, and also from sore month, produced in\r\nthe same manner. The best thing for this is a light decoction of\r\nwhite-oak bark, applied with a sponge to the sore parts. Charcoal, mixed\r\nin water, and applied in the same manner, is good. Any quantity of this\r\ncan be used, as it is not dangerous. If possible, give the animal\r\nnourishing gruels, or bran mashes; and, above all, keep the bit out of\r\nthe mouth until it is perfectly healed.\r\n\r\nPOLL-EVIL.\r\n\r\nThis is a disease the mule more than all other animals is subject to.\r\nThis is more particularly so with those brought into the service of the\r\nGovernment unbroken.\r\n\r\nIt will be very easily seen that the necessary course of training,\r\nhalter-breaking, &c., will expose them to many of the causes of this\r\ndisease. Aside from this, the inhuman treatment of teamsters, and others\r\nwho have charge of them, frequently produces it in its worst form. It\r\nbegins with an ulcer or sore at the junction where the head and neck\r\njoin; and from its position, more than any other cause, is very\r\ndifficult to heal. The first thing to be done, when the swelling\r\nappears, is to use hot fomentations. If these are not at hand, use cold\r\nwater frequently. Keep the bridle and halter from the parts. In case\r\ninflammation cannot be abated, and ulceration takes place, the only\r\nmeans to effect a cure, with safety and certainty, is by the use of the\r\nseton. This should be applied only by a hand well skilled in the use of\r\nit. The person should also well understand the anatomy of the parts, as\r\ninjuries committed with the seton-needle, in those parts, are often more\r\nserious and more difficult of cure than the disease caused by the first\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nFISTULA.\r\n\r\nThis is a disease the mule is more subject to than any other animal in\r\nGovernment use. And this, on account of his being used as a beast of\r\nburden by almost all nations and classes of people, and because he is\r\nthe worst cared for. Fistula is the result of a bruise. Some animals\r\nhave been known to produce it by rolling on stones and other hard\r\nsubstances. It generally makes its appearance first in the way of a rise\r\nor swelling where the saddle has been allowed to press too hard on the\r\nwithers, and especially when the animal has high and lean ones. As the\r\nanimal becomes reduced in flesh, the withers, as a matter of course, are\r\nmore exposed and appear higher, on account of the muscle wasting from\r\neach side of the back-bone. This, under the saddle, can be remedied to a\r\ngreat extent, by adding an additional fold to the saddle blanket, or in\r\nmaking the pad of the saddle high enough to keep it from the withers. In\r\npacking with the pack-saddle this is more difficult, as the weight is\r\ngenerally a dead, heavy substance, and as the animal steps low or high,\r\nthe pack does the same. Much, however, might be done by care in packing,\r\nto prevent injury to the withers and bruising of the back-bone. When the\r\nwithers begin to swell and inflammation sets in, or a tumor begins to\r\nform, the whole may be driven away and the fistula scattered or avoided\r\nby frequent or almost constant applications of cold water--the same as\r\nis recommended in poll-evil. But if, in despite of this, the swelling\r\nshould continue or become larger, warm fomentations, poultices, and\r\nstimulating embrocations should be applied, in order to bring the\r\nprotuberance to its full formation as soon as possible. When full, a\r\nseton should be passed, by a skillful hand, from the top to the bottom\r\nof the tumor, so that all the pus may have free access of escape. The\r\nincision should be kept free until all the matter has escaped and the\r\nwound shows signs of healing. The after treatment must be similar to\r\nthat recommended in the case of poll-evil. The above treatment, if\r\nproperly administered, will in nearly all cases of _fistula_ effect a\r\ncure.\r\n\r\nCOLLAR-GALLS.\r\n\r\nSore necks, saddle-galls, and stilfasts, are a species of injury and\r\nsore, which are in many cases very difficult of cure, especially\r\nsaddle-galls on mules that have to be ridden every day. One of the best\r\nremedies for saddle gall is to heighten the saddle up as much as\r\npossible, and bathe the back with cold water as often as an opportunity\r\naffords. In many cases this will drive the fever away and scatter the\r\ntrouble that is about to take place. This, however, does not always\r\nscatter, for the trouble will often continue, a root forming in the\r\ncenter of what we call the saddle-gall. The edges of this will be clear,\r\nand the stilfast hold only by the root. I have had many cases of this\r\nkind occur with the mule, both on his back and neck, mostly caused on\r\nthe latter part by the collar being too loose. And I have found but one\r\nway to effectually cure them. Some persons advise cutting, which I think\r\nis too tedious and painful to the animal. My advice is to take a pair of\r\npincers, or forceps of any kind, and pull it out. This done, bathe\r\nfrequently with cold water, and keep the collar or saddle as much free\r\nof the sore as possible. This will do more towards relieving the animal\r\nand healing the injury than all the medicine you can give. A little\r\nsoothing oil, or grease free from salt, may be rubbed lightly on the\r\nparts as they begin to heal. This is a very simple but effective remedy.\r\n\r\nTHRUSH.\r\n\r\nThis is another trouble with which the mule is afflicted. Cut away the\r\nparts of the frog that seem to be destroyed, clean the parts well with\r\ncastile-soap, and apply muriatic acid. If you have not this at hand, a\r\nlittle tar mixed with salt, and placed on oakum or tow, and applied,\r\nwill do nearly as well. Apply this every day, keeping the parts well\r\ndressed, and the feet according to directions in shoeing, and the\r\ntrouble will soon disappear.\r\n\r\nCHEST FOUNDERS.\r\n\r\nMules are not subject to this disease. Some persons assert that they\r\nare, but it is a mistake. These persons mistake for founder in the chest\r\nwhat is nothing more than a case of contraction of the feet. I have\r\nrepeatedly seen veterinary surgeons connected with the army, on being\r\nasked what was the trouble with a mule, look wise, and declare the\r\ncomplaint chest founder, swelling of the shoulders, &c. I was inclined\r\nto put some faith in the wisdom of these gentlemen, until Doctor Braley,\r\nchief veterinary surgeon of the department of Washington, produced the\r\nmost convincing proofs that it was almost an impossibility for these\r\nanimals to become injured in the shoulder. When mules become sore in\r\nfront, look well to their feet, and in nine cases out of ten, you will\r\nfind the cause of the trouble there. In very many cases a good practical\r\nshoer can remove the trouble by proper paring and shoeing.\r\n\r\nBLEEDING.\r\n\r\nIt was always a subject of inquiry with me, who originated the system of\r\nbleeding; and why it was that all kinds of doctors and physicians\r\npersist in taking the stream of life itself from the system in order to\r\npreserve life. In the case of General Washington, which I copy from the\r\n_Independent Chronicle_ of Boston, January 6, 1800, the editor, using\r\n\"James Craik, physician, and Elisha C. Dick, physician,\" as authority,\r\nstates that a bleeder was procured in the neighborhood, who took from\r\nthe General's arm from twelve to fourteen ounces of blood, in the\r\nmorning; and in the afternoon of the same day was bled copiously twice.\r\nMore than that, it was agreed upon by these same enlightened doctors, to\r\ntry the result of another blood-letting, by which thirty two ounces more\r\nwas drawn. And, wonderful as it may seem to the intelligent mind at this\r\nday, they state that all this was done without the slightest alleviation\r\nof the disease. The world has become more wise now, and experience has\r\nshown how ridiculous this system of bleeding was. What is true in regard\r\nto the human system is also true in regard to the animal. There are some\r\nextreme cases in which I have no doubt moderate bleeding might render\r\nrelief. But these cases are so few that it should only be suffered to be\r\ndone by an experienced, careful, and skillful person. My advice is,\r\navoid it in all cases where you can.\r\n\r\nCOLIC.\r\n\r\nThe mule is quite subject to this complaint. It is what is commonly\r\nknown as belly-ache. Over doses of cold water will produce it. There is\r\nnothing, however, so likely to produce it in the mule as changes of\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nMusty corn will also produce it, and should never be given to animals. I\r\nrecollect, in 1856, when I was in New Mexico, at Fort Union, we had\r\nseveral mules die from eating what is termed Spanish or Mexican corn, a\r\nsmall blue and purplish grain. It was exceedingly hard and flinty, and,\r\nin fact, more like buckshot than grain. We fed about four quarts of this\r\nto the mule, at the first feed. The result was, they swelled up, began\r\nto pant, look round at their sides, sweat above the eyes and at the\r\nflanks. Then they commenced to roll, spring up suddenly, lie down again,\r\nroll and try to lie on their backs. Then they would spring up, and after\r\nstanding a few seconds, fall down, and groan, and pant. At length they\r\nwould resign themselves to what they apparently knew to be their fate,\r\nand die. And yet, singular as it may seem, the animal could be\r\naccustomed to this grain by judicious feeding at first.\r\n\r\nWe did not know at that time what to give the animal to relieve or cure\r\nhim; and the Government lost hundreds of valuable animals through our\r\nwant of knowledge. Whenever these violent cases appear, get some common\r\nsoap, make a strong suds and drench the mule with it. I have found in\r\nevery case where I used it that the mule got well. It is the alkali in\r\nthe soap that neutralizes the gases. There is another good receipt, and\r\nit is generally to be found in camp. Take two ounces of saleratus, put\r\nit into a pint of water, shake well, and then drench with the same.\r\nAbove all things, keep whisky and other stimulants away, as they only\r\nserve to aggravate the disease.\r\n\r\nPHYSICKING.\r\n\r\nThis is another of those imaginary cures resorted to by persons having\r\ncharge of mules. Very many of these persons honestly believe that it is\r\nnecessary to clean the animal out every spring with large doses of\r\npoisonous and other truck. This, they say, ought to be given to loosen\r\nthe hide, soften the hair, &c. In my opinion it does very little good.\r\nIf his dung gets dry, and his hair hard and crispy, give him bran mashes\r\nmixed with his grain, and a teaspoonful of salt at each feed. If there\r\nis grass, let him graze a few hours every day. This will do more towards\r\nsoftening his coat and loosening his bowels than any thing else. When\r\nreal disease makes its appearance, it is time to use medicines; but they\r\nshould be applied by some one who thoroughly understands them.\r\n\r\nSTRINGHALT.\r\n\r\nThis sometimes occurs in the mule. It is a sudden, nervous, quick jerk\r\nof either or both of the hind legs. In the mule it frequently shows but\r\nlittle after being worked an hour or so. It is what I regard as\r\nunsoundness, and a mule badly affected with it is generally of but\r\nlittle use. It is often the result of strains, caused by backing,\r\npulling and twisting, and heavy falls. You can detect it in its\r\nslightest form by turning the animal short around to the right or to the\r\nleft. Turn him in the track he stands in, as near as possible, and then\r\nback him. If he has it, one of these three ways will develop its\r\nsymptoms. There are a great many opinions as to the soundness or\r\nunsoundness of an animal afflicted with this complaint. If I had now a\r\ngood animal afflicted with it, the pain caused to my feelings by looking\r\nat it would be a serious drawback.\r\n\r\nCRAMP.\r\n\r\nI have now under my charge several mules that are subject to this\r\ncomplaint. It does not really injure them for service, but it is very\r\ndisagreeable to those having them in charge. It frequently requires from\r\nhalf an hour to two hours to get them rubbed so as the blood gets to its\r\nproper circulation, and to get them to walk without dragging their legs.\r\nIn cases where they are attacked violently, they will appear to lose all\r\nuse of their legs. I have known cases when a sudden stroke with a light\r\npiece of board, so as to cause a surprise, would drive it away. In other\r\ncases sudden application of the whip would have the same effect.\r\n\r\nSPAVIN.\r\n\r\nIt is generally believed that the mule does not inherit this disease.\r\nBut this is not altogether true. Small, compact mules, bred after the\r\njack, are indeed not subject to it. On the contrary, large mules, bred\r\nfrom large, coarse mares, are very frequently afflicted with it. The\r\nauthor has under his charge at the present time quite a number of those\r\nkind of mules, in which this disease is visible. At times, when worked\r\nhard, they are sore and lame. The only thing to be recommended in this\r\ncase is careful treatment, and as much rest at intervals as it is\r\npossible to give them. Hand rubbing and application of stimulant\r\nliniments, or tincture of arnica, is about all that can be done. The old\r\nmethod of firing and blistering only puts the animal to torture and the\r\nowner to expense. A cure can never be effected through it, and therefore\r\nshould never be tried.\r\n\r\nRINGBONE.\r\n\r\nThese appear on the same kind of large, bony mules as referred to in\r\ncases of spavin, and are incurable. They can, however, be relieved by\r\nthe same process as recommended in spavin. Relief can also be afforded\r\nby letting the heels of the affected feet grow down to considerable\r\nlength, or shoeing with a high-heeled shoe, and thus taking the weight\r\nor strain off the injured parts. The only way to make the best use or an\r\nanimal afflicted with this disease, is to abandon experiments to effect\r\na cure, as they will only be attended with expense and disappointment.\r\n\r\nMANGE.\r\n\r\nMules are subject to this disease when kept in large numbers, as in the\r\narmy. This is peculiarly a cuticle disease, like the itch in the human\r\nsystem, and yields to the same course of treatment. A mixture of sulphur\r\nand hog's lard, one pint of the latter to two of the former. Rub the\r\nanimal all over, then cover with a blanket. After standing two days,\r\nwash him clean with soft-soap and water. After this process has been\r\ngone through, keep the animal blanketed for a few days, as he will be\r\nliable to take cold. Feed with bran mashes, plenty of common salt, and\r\nwater. This will relieve the bowels all that is necessary, and can\r\nscarcely fail of effecting a cure. Another method, but not so certain in\r\nits effect, is to make a decoction of tobacco, say about one pound of\r\nthe stems to two gallons of water, boiled until the strength is\r\nextracted from the weed, and when cool enough, bathe the mule well with\r\nit from head to foot, let him dry off, and do not curry him for a day or\r\ntwo. Then curry him well, and if the itching appear again, repeat the\r\nbathing two or three times, and it will produce a cure. The same\r\ntreatment will apply in case of lice, which frequently occurs where\r\nmules are kept in large numbers. Mercury should never be used in any\r\nform, internally or externally, on an animal so much exposed as the\r\nmule.\r\n\r\nGREASE-HEEL.\r\n\r\nClean the parts well with castile-soap and warm water. As soon as you\r\nhave discovered the disease, stop wetting the legs, as that only\r\naggravates it, and use ointment made from the following substances:\r\nPowdered charcoal, two ounces; lard or tallow, four ounces; sulphur, two\r\nounces. Mix them well together, then rub the ointment in well with your\r\nhand on the affected parts. If the above is not at hand, get gunpowder,\r\nsome lard or tallow, in equal parts, and apply in the same manner. If\r\nthe animal be poor, and his system need toning up, give him plenty of\r\nnourishing food, with bran mash mixed plentifully with the grain. Add a\r\nteaspoonful of salt two or three times a day, as it will aid in keeping\r\nthe bowels open. If the stable bottoms, or floors, or yards are filthy,\r\nsee that they are properly cleaned, as filthiness is one of the causes\r\nof this disease. The same treatment will apply to scratches, as they are\r\nthe same disease in a different form.\r\n\r\nTo avoid scratches and grease-heel during the winter, or indeed at any\r\nother season, the hair on the mule's heels should never be cut. Nor\r\nshould the mud, in winter season, be washed off, but allowed to dry on\r\nthe animal's legs, and then rubbed off with hay or straw. This washing,\r\nand cutting the hair off the legs, leave them without any protection,\r\nand is, in many cases, the cause of grease-heel and scratches.\r\n\r\nSHOES, SHOEING, AND THE FOOT.\r\n\r\nThe foot, its diseases, and how to shoe it properly, is a subject much\r\ndiscussed among horsemen. Nearly every farrier and blacksmith has a way\r\nof his own for curing diseased feet, and shoeing. No matter how absurd\r\nit may be, he will insist that it has merits superior to all others, and\r\nit would be next to impossible to convince him of his error. Skillful\r\nveterinarians now understand perfectly all the diseases peculiar to the\r\nfoot, and the means of effecting a cure. They understand, also, what\r\nsort of shoe is needed for the feet of different animals. Latterly\r\nnumber of shoes have been invented and patented, all professing to be\r\nexactly what is wanted to relieve and cure diseased feet of all kinds.\r\nOne man has a shoe he calls \"_concave_,\" and says it will cure\r\ncontraction, corns, thrush, quarter-crack, toe-crack, &c., &c. But when\r\nyou come to examine it closely, you will find it nothing more than a\r\nnicely dressed piece of iron, made almost in the shape of a half moon.\r\nAfter a fair trial, however, it will be found of no more virtue in\r\ncuring diseases or relieving the animal than the ordinary shoe used by a\r\ncountry smithy. Another inventive genius springs up and asserts that he\r\nhas discovered a shoe that will cure all sorts of diseased feet; and\r\nbrings at least a bushel basket full of letters from persons he declares\r\nto be interested in the horse, confirming what he has said of the\r\nvirtues of his shoe. But a short trial of this wonderful shoe only goes\r\nto show how little these persons understand the whole subject, and how\r\neasy a matter it is to procure letters recommending what they have\r\ninvented.\r\n\r\nAnother has a \"specific method\" for shoeing, which is to cut away the\r\ntoe right in the center of the foot, cut away the bars on the inside of\r\nthe foot, cut and clean away all around on the inside of the hoof, then\r\nto let the animal stand on a board floor, so that his feet would be in\r\nthe position a saucer would represent with one piece broken out at the\r\nfront and two at the back. This I consider the most inhuman method in\r\nthe art of shoeing. Turn this saucer upside down and see how little\r\npressure it would bear, and you will have some idea of the cruelty of\r\napplying this \"specific method.\" Sometimes bar-shoes and other\r\ncontrivances are used, to keep the inside of the foot from coming down.\r\nBut why do this? Why not get at once a shoe adapted to the spreading of\r\nthe foot. Tyrell's shoe for this purpose is the best I have yet seen. We\r\nhave used it in the Government service for two years, and experience has\r\ntaught me that it has advantages that ought not to be overlooked. But\r\neven this shoe may be used to disadvantage by ignorant hands. Indeed, in\r\nthe hands of a blacksmith who prefers \"his own way,\" some kinds of feet\r\nmay be just as badly injured by it as others are benefited. The United\r\nStates Army affords the largest field for gaining practical knowledge\r\nconcerning the diseases, especially of the feet, with which horses and\r\nmules are afflicted. During the late war, when so little care was given\r\nto animals in the field, when they were injured in every conceivable\r\nmanner, and by all sorts of accidents, the veterinary found a field for\r\nstudy such as has never been opened before.\r\n\r\nExperience has taught me, that common sense is one of the most essential\r\nthings in the treatment of a horse's foot. You must remember that\r\nhorses' feet differ as well as men's, and require different treatment,\r\nespecially in shoeing. You must shoe the foot according to its\r\npeculiarity and demands, not according to any specific \"system of shoe.\"\r\nGive the ground surface a level bearing, let the frog come to the\r\nground, and the weight of the mule rest on the frog as much as any other\r\npart of the foot. If it project beyond the shoe, so much the better.\r\nThat is what it was made for, and to catch the weight on an elastic\r\nprinciple. Never, under any circumstances, cut it away. Put two nails in\r\nthe shoe on each side, and both forward of the quarters, and one in the\r\ntoe, directly in front of the foot. Let those on the sides be an inch\r\napart, then you will be sure not to cut and tear the foot. Let the nails\r\nand nail-holes be small, for they will then aid in saving the foot. It\r\nwill still further aid in saving it by letting the nails run well up\r\ninto the hoof, for that keeps the shoe steadier on the foot. The hoof is\r\njust as thick to within an inch of the top, and is generally sounder,\r\nand of a better substance, than it is at the bottom. Keep the first\r\nreason for shoeing apparent in your mind always--that you only shoe your\r\nmule because his feet will not stand the roads without it. And whenever\r\nyou can, shoe him with a shoe exactly the shape of his foot. Some\r\nblacksmiths will insist on a shoe, and then cutting and shaping the foot\r\nto it. The first or central surface of the hoof, made hard by the\r\nanimal's own peculiar way of traveling, indicates the manner in which he\r\nshould be shod. All the art in the world cannot improve this, for it is\r\nthe model prepared by nature. Let the shoes be as light as possible, and\r\nwithout calks if it can be afforded, as the mule always travels unsteady\r\non them. The Goodenough shoe is far superior to the old calked shoe, and\r\nwill answer every purpose where holding is necessary. It is also good in\r\nmountainous countries, and there is no danger of the animal calking\r\nhimself with it. I have carefully observed the different effect of\r\nshoes, while with troops on the march. I accompanied the Seventh\r\nInfantry, in 1858, in its march to Cedar Valley, in Utah, a distance of\r\nfourteen hundred miles, and noticed that scarcely a man who wore\r\nregulation shoes had a blister on his feet, while the civilians, who did\r\nnot, were continually falling out, and dropping to the rear, from the\r\neffects of narrow and improper shoes and boots. The same is the case\r\nwith the animal. The foot must have something flat and broad to bear on.\r\nThe first care of those having charge of mules, should be to see that\r\ntheir feet are kept in as near a natural state as possible. Then, if all\r\nthe laws of nature be observed, and strictly obeyed, the animal's feet\r\nwill last as long, and be as sound in his domestic state as he would be\r\nin a state of nature.\r\n\r\nThe most ordinary observer will soon find that the outer portion or\r\ncovering of the mule's foot possesses very little animal life, and has\r\nno sensibility, like the hair or covering of the body. Indeed, the foot\r\nof the horse and mule is a dense block of horn, and must therefore be\r\ninfluenced and governed by certain chemical laws, which control the\r\nelements that come in contact with it. Hence it was that the feet of\r\nthese animals was made to bear on the hard ground, and to be wet\r\nnaturally every time the horse drank. Drought and heat will contract and\r\nmake hard and brittle the substance of which the feet is composed; while\r\non the other hand cooling and moisture will expand it, and render it\r\npliable and soft. Nature has provided everything necessary to preserve\r\nand protect this foot, while the animal is in a natural state; but when\r\nbrought into domestic use, it requires the good sense of man, whose\r\nservant he is, to artificially employ those means which nature has\r\nprovided, to keep it perfectly healthy.\r\n\r\nWhen, then, the foot is in a healthy state, wet it at least twice a day;\r\nand do not be content with merely throwing cold water on the outside,\r\nfor the foot takes in very little if any moisture through the wall. In\r\nshort, it absorbs moisture most through the frog and sole, particularly\r\nin the region where the sole joins the wall. This, if covered by a tight\r\nshoe, closes the medium, and prevents the proper supply. Horses that are\r\nshod should be allowed to stand in moist places as much as possible. Use\r\nclay or loam floors, especially if the horse has to stand much of his\r\ntime. Stone or brick is the next best, as the foot of the animal will\r\nabsorb moisture from either of these. Dry pine planks are the very\r\nworst, because they attract moisture from the horse's foot. Where\r\nanimals have to stand idle much of the time, keep their feet well\r\nstuffed with cow manure at night. That is the best and cheapest\r\npreservative of the feet that you can use.\r\n\r\nADVICE TO BLACKSMITHS.\r\n\r\nLet me enjoin you, for humanity's sake, that when you first undertake to\r\nshoe a young animal, you will not forget the value of kind treatment.\r\nKeep its head turned away from the glaring fire, the clinking anvil,\r\n&c., &c. Let the man whom he has been accustomed to, the groom or owner,\r\nstand at his head, and talk to him kindly. When you approach him for the\r\nfirst time, let it be without those implements you are to use in his\r\nshoeing. Speak to him gently, then take up his foot. If he refuse to let\r\nyou do this, let the person having him in charge do it. A young animal\r\nwill allow this with a person he is accustomed to, when he will repel a\r\nstranger. By treating him kindly you can make him understand what is\r\nwanted; by abusing him you will only frighten him into obstinacy. When\r\nyou have got the animal under perfect subjection, examine the foot\r\ncarefully, and you will find the heels, at the back part of the frog,\r\nentirely free from that member, which is soft and spongy. When the foot\r\nis down, resting on the ground, grasp the heels in your strong hand,\r\npress them inwards towards the frog, and you will immediately find that\r\nthey will yield. You will then see that what yields so easily to the\r\nmere pressure of the hand will expand and spread out when the weight of\r\nthe body is thrown on it. This should give you an idea of what you have\r\nto do in shoeing that foot, and your practical knowledge should stand\r\nyou well in an argument with any of those \"learned professors,\" who\r\ndeclare the foot of the mule does not expand or contract. In truth it is\r\none of its necessary conditions. After being a long time badly shod,\r\nnearly or all of this necessary principle of the foot will be lost. You\r\nshould therefore study to preserve it. And here let me give you what\r\nlittle aid experience has enabled me to do. You will observe the ground\r\nsurface of the foot, no matter how high the arch may be, to be at least\r\nhalf an inch wide, and sometimes more than an inch, with the heels\r\nspread out at the outside quarter. Do not cut away this important brace.\r\nIt is as necessary to the heel of the animal, to guard him against\r\nlateral motion, on which the whole of the above structure depends, as\r\nthe toes are to the human being. Curve the outside of the shoe nearly to\r\nfit the foot, and you will find the inside heel a little straighter,\r\nespecially if the animal be narrow-breasted, and the feet stand close\r\ntogether. Nature has provided this safeguard to prevent its striking the\r\nopposite leg. After the shoe is prepared to fit the foot, as I have\r\nbefore described, rasp the bottom level--it will be found nearly so. Do\r\nnot put a knife to the sole or the frog. The sole of the foot, remember,\r\nis its life, and the frog its defender. In punching the shoe, two\r\nnail-holes on a side, on a foot like this, are sufficient to hold on a\r\nshoe. Three may be used, if set in their proper places, without injury\r\nto the foot. Practice will teach you that any more nailing than this is\r\nunnecessary. I have used two nails on a side on an animal with not the\r\nbest of a foot, and very high action, and he has worn them entirely out\r\nwithout throwing either of them off. Previous to punching the shoe,\r\nobserve the grain of the foot. It will be seen that the fibres of the\r\nhoof run from the top of the foot, or coronary border, towards the toe,\r\nin most feet, at an angle of about forty-five degrees. It will be plain,\r\nthen, that if the nails are driven with the grain of the horn, they will\r\ndrive much easier, and hold better, and be less liable to cut and crack\r\nthe fibers.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit can be derived from this process of nailing. When the\r\nfoot comes to the ground, the nails act as a brace to keep the foot from\r\nslipping forward off the shoe. This renders that very ingenious foot\r\ndestroyer, the toe-clip, unnecessary. Then, in punching the shoe, hold\r\nthe top of the pritchell toward the heel of the shoe, so as to get the\r\nhole in the shoe on an angle with the grain of the hoof. Punch the holes\r\nlarge enough, so that the nails will not bind in the shoe, nor require\r\nunnecessary hammering or bruising of the foot to get them up to their\r\nproper place. Prepare the nails well, point them thin and narrow; and,\r\nas I have said before, use as small a nail as possible.\r\n\r\nWhen you proceed to nail on the shoe, take a slight hold at the bottom,\r\nso as to be sure that the nail starts in the wall of the foot instead of\r\nthe sole. Let it come out as high up as possible. You need not be afraid\r\nof pricking with nails set in this way, as the wall of the foot is as\r\nthick, until you get within half an inch of the top, as it is where you\r\nset the nail. Nails driven in this way injure the feet less, hold on\r\nlonger, and are stronger than when driven in any other way. If you have\r\nany doubt of this, test it in this manner: when you take off an old shoe\r\nto set a new one, and cut the clinches (which should be done in all\r\ncases), you will find the old nail and the clinches not started up; and\r\nin drawing the nail out you will also find the foot not slipped or\r\ncracked; and that the horn binds the nail until it is entirely drawn\r\nout. Indeed, I have known the hole to almost close as the nail left it.\r\n\r\nSet the two front nails well towards the toe, so as not to be more than\r\ntwo inches apart when measured across the bottom of the foot. Let the\r\nnext two divide the distance from that to the heel, so as to leave from\r\ntwo to two and a half inches free of nails, as the form of the foot may\r\nallow. Lastly, before nailing on the shoe, and while it is cold on the\r\nanvil, strike the surface that comes next to the foot on the outside, a\r\nfew blows with the hammer, right across the heels, and see also that the\r\noutside of the heels is a shade lowest, so that the animal in throwing\r\nhis weight upon them will spread out, and not pinch in his feet.",
