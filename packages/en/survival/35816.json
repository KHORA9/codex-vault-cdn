There\r\nis no sugar cane known anywhere to-day in the wild state although there\r\nare several species of mammoth grasses closely akin to this plant.\r\n\r\nAs various portions of the earth's surface were explored and finally\r\nsettled the sugar industry was extended until to-day one finds it\r\nflourishing in practically all tropical countries and many subtropical\r\ncountries as well. Perhaps the last semitropical region to attempt\r\nthis industry in a commercial way was the State of Arizona, U. S. A.,\r\nwhere the desert wastes were turned into flourishing beet and cane\r\nfields by the aid of irrigation from the Government storage dam.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Napoleon in France trade in the sugars from\r\nBritish and other foreign possessions was destroyed by the war with\r\nEngland but this decline in the cane-sugar trade served only as an\r\nimpetus to the new beet-sugar industry then being started. In the\r\nmeantime there was such a dearth of sugar and such a fabulous rise in\r\nprices, that attempts were made to secure sugar from various plants\r\nand fruits growing in France, such as beets, sorghum, maize, grapes,\r\napples, pears, figs, etc.\r\n\r\nAt that time the manufacture of a kind of sugar from grapes\r\nbecame quite important so that during the period from 1811\r\nto 1813 considerable quantities of this class of sugar were\r\nmade. Simultaneously with this new venture the beet root was gaining in\r\nimportance year by year, especially in France, and to a certain extent\r\nas well in other European countries, until after extensive experiments\r\nin plant breeding it was learned that the sucrose value of the root\r\ncould be very much improved. From this work varieties of beets used\r\nto-day have evolved which often contain as high as 20 to 25 per cent\r\nsucrose. Another obstacle in the way was the bad taste and odor of\r\nthe low-grade sugars from the beets and the difficulty of making a\r\nhigh-grade sugar. To-day the heavy liming and the carbonation process\r\ngive a sugar equal in all respects to the best grade of granulated\r\ncane sugar, and one finds a great deal of beet sugar either mixed\r\nwith cane sugar or marketed alone under the name of cane sugar.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the beet-sugar industry has become so important\r\nthat more than eight million tons, or about one-half of all the sugar\r\nproduced, comes from this source.\r\n\r\nThere is a greater consumption of sugar each year which necessitates\r\ngreater production either through larger areas, heavier yields, or\r\nits manufacture from other sacchariferous plants. The maximum in both\r\narea and yield have by no means been reached, while in recent years\r\na large number of sacchariferous plants have attracted the attention\r\nof various investigators throughout the sugar world, and this will in\r\nall probability lead to a new source of supply. The most promising\r\nof these plants is the sugar palm (Arenga saccharifera). Extensive\r\nwork was conducted on this palm by this Bureau and reported in the\r\nMay, 1914, number of the Philippine Agricultural Review. During the\r\nabove-mentioned year an entirely new method of juice clarification\r\nwas elaborated which is applicable to the juices of various other\r\npalms as well as to that of the sugar cane.\r\n\r\nIn Bengal the wild date palm (Phoenix silvestris) has produced a low\r\ngrade of molasses sugar for consumption by the natives for a great\r\nnumber of years. The main obstacle encountered in making a good\r\ngrade of sugar from this palm has been caused by the difficulty of\r\nclarification and the susceptibility of the juice to fermentation. It\r\nis thought that the above-mentioned process may bring this palm into\r\ngreater prominence in the sugar world.\r\n\r\nThere are also the Palmera (Borassus flabelliformis) of Southern India,\r\nand the Nipa (Nipa fructicans) of the Philippines. Either of these\r\ncould undoubtedly be made profitable sugar producers. The latter is\r\nused commercially only as a source of alcohol.\r\n\r\nThere is practically no limit to the number of sacchariferous plants\r\none might name in the Tropics and subtropics, but many of these do\r\nnot contain a sufficient percentage of sucrose, or else they contain\r\nsuch a high percentage of impurities that the low yield of sugar and\r\nthe high cost of manufacture make their use unprofitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCITRUS FRUITS IN THE PHILIPPINES. [1]\r\n\r\nBy P. J. Wester, Horticulturist in Charge of Lamao Experiment Station.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY REMARKS.\r\n\r\nDe Candolle, in his \"Origin of Cultivated Plants,\" discusses 5 species\r\nbelonging to the genus Citrus: The pomelo, C. decumana L.; the citron,\r\nlemon, and lime, here considered as distinct species, which he includes\r\nunder the one species, C. medica L.; the sweet orange, C. aurantium\r\nL., which he separates from the sour orange and which is also by him\r\nconsidered as a distinct species, C. vulgaris Risso; and finally the\r\nmandarin, C. nobilis Lour. Of these, the pomelo, orange, mandarin,\r\nlemon, lime, and citron are important pomologically, the sour orange\r\nbeing grown principally as stock for the other species.\r\n\r\nThe pomelo is by the same author considered to be indigenous to the\r\nPacific Islands east of Java, the citron and affiliated species to\r\nhave originated in India, and the sour orange east of India, and all\r\nto have been in cultivation for over two thousand years. The antiquity\r\nof the orange and mandarin is less, both species being from China\r\nand Cochin China.\r\n\r\nAll these species have been introduced into the Philippine Archipelago,\r\nand are well distributed excepting the sour orange, which is rarely\r\nseen. The discussion of all species refers to them as found in the\r\nPhilippines except when otherwise stated.\r\n\r\nNo very distinct types are found among the oranges or mandarins;\r\nthe variation in the pomelo is considerable, although, so far as\r\nthe writer has noted, scarcely enough to warrant the distinction of\r\nseparate varieties. Both the white and red-fleshed types occur with\r\nmany gradations, but no studies have been made to note which other\r\ncorrelative characters, if any, are identified with these different\r\nforms. The very primitive pomelos (Pl. II, c) that are not infrequently\r\nseen in cultivation might indicate that this species is indigenous\r\nto the Philippines, though so far as the writer knows the tree has\r\nnever been seen in the virgin forest. Closer observations have been\r\nmade on the general type represented by the citron, including the\r\nlemon and lime, and several distinct forms have been recognized.\r\n\r\nThe calamondin, C. mitis Blanco, is well known to be indigenous,\r\nas well as the cabuyao and related plants that have been referred to\r\nC. histrix DC. In the first-named species there seem to be no very\r\nmarked variations.\r\n\r\nC. histrix was described by De Candolle, flowers and fruits excepted,\r\nfrom a plant growing in Montpellier, being recognized principally by\r\nits long broad-winged petioles and free stamens. The writer has not\r\nhad the opportunity to see the original description of C. histrix\r\nor examine the type specimen, but Swingle refers to it in Jour. of\r\nAgri. Research, Vol. I, No. 1, page 10, 1913, as having broadly winged\r\npetioles, often larger than the blades, the wings being more gradually\r\nnarrowed toward the base and usually more abruptly truncate at the\r\ntip than C. ichangensis Swingle, making then somewhat triangular\r\nin outline.\r\n\r\nWithin these broad limitations a number of otherwise remarkably\r\ndistinct forms may be recognized some of which were illustrated\r\nin a previous publication, Bureau of Agriculture Bulletin No. 27,\r\nCitriculture in the Philippines, 1913, and referred to C. histrix\r\nwith the statement that \"some of these forms unquestionably will be\r\nrecognized as subspecies on closer study, or possibly as separate\r\nspecies.\" Since then several plants of this type in the citrus\r\ncollection assembled at Lamao by the Bureau of Agriculture have bloomed\r\nand fruited, affording an opportunity for fuller observations, and\r\nthese have been further complemented during a trip to Bohol and Cebu\r\nin May, 1914, and by the fruits forwarded by Mr. E. F. Southwick.\r\n\r\nHowever, assuming that C. histrix (or some of its subspecies) is the\r\nC. histrix of De Candolle, there still remain, on one hand the limao,\r\nand on the other the biasong, balincolong, samuyao, samuyao-sa-amoo,\r\nas widely different from each other and the cabuyao and its subspecies\r\nas for instance the orange, and pomelo, or the mandarin and the\r\ncalamondin. A very interesting characteristic has been discovered in\r\nseveral of the citrus fruits that have free stamens in the form of a\r\nmore or less distinct nucleus in the juice cells; this, so far as the\r\nwriter knows, has not been previously recorded in a citrus fruit. The\r\nfact that the presence of these nuclei is not here referred to in\r\nsome species with free stamens does not necessarily mean that they\r\nare absent, considering that fruits of these particular species have\r\nnot been examined since the first nuclear cells were discovered. The\r\nwriter is inclined to believe that these nuclei are correlative to\r\nthose species having free stamens.\r\n\r\nTo the student in the citrus-growing sections of the United States\r\nthe characterization of the citron, lemon and lime as given herein is\r\nno doubt satisfactory, but in the Philippines various forms called\r\n\"limon\" will appear that do not agree with this and it would then\r\nbe necessary either to make the descriptions more general so as\r\nto cover the additional forms or to classify these as species or\r\nsubspecies. If the barely margined petioles, comparatively small\r\nleaves, the green, tender growth and the white corolla are insisted\r\nupon for the lime, for instance, it is difficult to know where to\r\nplace the purple-growthed, thorny, wide-winged, purplish-petaled,\r\nsubglobose limes with wide-winged leaves of the Philippines. They\r\ncannot well be placed with the lemons, and still less with the citron,\r\nthough they of course show strong relationship to each. The citron\r\ngroup of the genus perhaps more than any other shows the need of\r\nfurther study and systematization of the entire genus.\r\n\r\nAttention should be called to the presence in the Philippines of the\r\nextremely primitive types of the citron and the lemons; for instance,\r\nthe fruit illustrated in Bulletin No. 27, Plate XVI (c), and colo-colo,\r\nas well as the lombog, referred to C. pseudolimonum in this paper.\r\n\r\nOf all the plants here discussed, C. micrantha var. microcarpa is\r\nbotanically furthest removed from the cultivated citrus fruits.\r\n\r\nEach considered as a separate species and constituting perhaps the\r\nmost complete description of these species published in English,\r\nMr. H. H. Hume's characterization of the orange, sour orange, mandarin,\r\npomelo, citron, lemon, and lime in his \"Citrus Fruits and Their\r\nCulture,\" is here reproduced without alteration. Some writers have\r\ngrouped several of these as subspecies under one great comprehensive\r\nspecies, but, as Mr. Hume aptly says: \"What advantage is there in\r\nthrowing the sour orange, sweet orange, pomelo, kumquat, and a few\r\nother distinctly different trees into one conglomerate species * * *\r\nand then placing each of the aforementioned plants under this species\r\nas subspecies and varieties. Such a procedure is more likely to result\r\nin further confusion than order.\"\r\n\r\nThe species of the genus Citrus that have come under the observation of\r\nthe writer, with two exceptions, seem naturally to divide themselves\r\ninto two groups,--(1) those with more or less united filaments and\r\nhypogeal cotyledons, and (2) those with free filaments, and (in all\r\ninstances where there has been an opportunity for observations) with\r\nsupra-terraneous, distinct cotyledons (fig. 1). In so far as these\r\ncharacteristics have been observed in the Philippine citrus fruits,\r\nlong and broad-winged petioles are a third correlative feature\r\ndistinguishing group No. 2; C. ichangensis recently described by\r\nSwingle from China also possesses this last feature, but has connate\r\nfilaments. The alsem and alemow seem to be intermediate between these\r\nforms, the alsem being most closely related to those in the first\r\ndivision, the filaments being connate, while the cotyledons in some\r\nlots that have been propagated appeared above ground. The alemow is\r\nmost closely related to group No. 2, the filaments being nearly always\r\nfree. The general character of the talamisan together with the presence\r\nof hypogeal cotyledons tends to the belief that this species has more\r\nor less united filaments and thus would belong to the first group.\r\n\r\nAll descriptions have been made from living plant material either\r\nduring tours of collection by the writer, or from plants grown\r\nat the Lamao experiment station from material sent to the Bureau\r\nof Agriculture from time to time since April, 1911. Also, all the\r\nmaterial has been collected from plants growing in the yard of some\r\nFilipino and so may lay claim to having been domesticated. While\r\nthis statement may not be altogether reliable it is interesting to\r\nnote that in Bohol the Filipinos stated that the following trees grew\r\nwild in the forest: Among-pong, amontay, balincolong, biasong, canci,\r\ncolo-colo, limoncito, limao, lombog, and samuyao.\r\n\r\nWhile it is believed that the species described in this paper include\r\nmost of the more distinctive Philippine citrus fruits, and several\r\nhitherto unknown even to the botanist, they do not by any means\r\nexhaust the Philippine forms of this genus. Several other forms have\r\nbeen noted, and constitute a part of the citrus collection at Lamao\r\nbut are not here referred to, for the reason that the material on\r\nhand is too incomplete to warrant their description at this time.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements.--The writer is greatly indebted to\r\nMr. E. F. Southwick, superintendent of the demonstration station at\r\nCebu, for his untiring zeal in repeatedly forwarding sets of citrus\r\nfruits and budwood from Bohol and Cebu, and for his most valuable\r\nassistance during a collection trip made by him and the writer to Cebu\r\nand Bohol in May, 1914, without which it would not have been possible\r\nto obtain much of the data and material collected. All the species\r\nand varieties credited to Bohol were first called to the attention\r\nof the Bureau by Mr. Southwick. Mr. G. W. Weathersbee, formerly\r\nagricultural inspector of this Bureau, first called attention to the\r\nalemow and has also assisted in the collection of citrus material\r\nin Cebu. Mr. A. M. Burton, formerly superintendent of the Trinidad\r\ngarden, Benguet, has forwarded fruits and budwood of the cabugao\r\nand other fruits. Mr. D. B. Mackie, entomologist of the Bureau,\r\nfirst called attention to a variety of alsem in Bontoc of superior\r\nquality. M. G. B. Mead sent the first specimens of Panuban.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTIONS AND COMMENTS.\r\n\r\nCitrus aurantium L. Orange.\r\n\r\nA tree 7.5 to 12 meters in height, with a compact, conical head; bark\r\ngrayish brown; thorns generally present, 12 to 50 millimeters long,\r\nsharp, stout; leaves oval or ovate oblong, 7.5 to 10 centimeters\r\nlong, smooth, shining, somewhat lighter below than above, margins\r\nentire, or very slightly serrate; petiole 12 to 25 millimeters\r\nlong, slightly winged (occasionally with quite a broad wing);\r\nflowers axillary in clusters of one to six, white, sweet scented,\r\nsmaller than those of C. vulgaris; calyx cupped; sepals four to five,\r\nawl-shaped, thick, greenish, persistent; petals usually five, oblong,\r\n25 to 31 millimeters long, thick, fleshy, recurved; stamens twenty\r\nto twenty-five, hypogenous, filaments flattened, united in groups,\r\nshorter than the petals; pistil distinctly divided into stigma, style\r\nand ovary; stigma knob-like; style long and slender; ovary rounded,\r\n10 to 14 loculed; fruit globose to oblate, light orange to reddish;\r\nrind smooth; pulp juicy, subacid; juice sacs spindle shaped, sometimes\r\nlarger than those of C. vulgaris; seeds few or many, oblong ovoid,\r\nplanoconvex, generally broad, wedged or pointed at the micropylar end,\r\nmarked with oblique ridges surrounding one or two plain areas. Native\r\nto China or Cochin China.\r\n\r\nWhile the orange is nowhere planted in orchards it is fairly well\r\ndistributed. Judging from the prevalence of the citrus fruits\r\nin the markets in the various parts of the Archipelago it ranks\r\nfifth in production, as compared with the mandarin, pomelo, lime,\r\nand calamondin, the only citrus fruits beside the orange that may\r\nclaim to be of any economic importance even from a Philippine point\r\nof view. Excepting a few budded trees of recent importation or\r\ndistribution by the Bureau of Agriculture all trees are seedlings\r\nand nearly always the fruit is poor in quality.\r\n\r\nSo far as noted, there are no variations worthy of notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitrus vulgaris Risso. Sour Orange.\r\n\r\n(Seville orange, Bigarade orange.)\r\n\r\nA small tree, 6 to 9 meters in height, with a dense compact head;\r\nyoung shoots light green, thorny; thorns alternate, small, sharp\r\nand pointed, on older wood larger, strong, stiff; leaves unifoliate,\r\nevergreen, alternate, ovate, pointed, strongly and peculiarly scented;\r\npetiole 12 to 18 millimeters long, broadly winged; flowers in small,\r\naxillary cymes, white, strongly sweet scented, somewhat larger than\r\nthose of C. aurantium; calyx cupped, segments 4 to 5, blunt; petals\r\nlinear oblong, conspicuously dotted with oil cells; stamens 20 to 24;\r\nfilaments united in groups; pistil club shaped, smooth; ovary 6 to 14\r\nloculed; fruit orange colored or frequently reddish when well matured,\r\ninclined to be rough; rind strongly aromatic, bitter; pulp acid; juice\r\nsacs spindle shaped, rather small; seeds flattened and wedged toward\r\nthe micropylar end, marked with ridged lines. Native to southeastern\r\nAsia, probably in Cochin China. Hardier than the sweet orange.\r\n\r\nSamples of what seems to be the sour orange have been received from\r\nDavao, Mindanao.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitrus nobilis Lour. Mandarin.\r\n\r\nA small tree 3.6 to 6 meters in height, with a dense head of upright\r\nor willowy, drooping branches; bark dark brownish or streaked with\r\ngray; branchlets light green or dark in color, small, slender,\r\nround or angled, thornless, or provided with small sharp spines;\r\nleaves small, lanceolate to oval, slightly crenate; petioles short,\r\nwingless, or with very small wings; flowers terminating the branchlets\r\nor axillary, sometimes clustered, 18 to 25 millimeters across, sweet\r\nscented; calyx small, shallow, cupped, the petals small; petals white,\r\nfleshy, recurved; stamens 18 to 23 in number, shorter than the petals;\r\npistil small, resembling that of C. aurantium; ovary 9 to 15 loculed;\r\nfruit distinctly oblate, orange to reddish in color; pulp sweet\r\nor subacid; juice sacs broad and blunt; seeds top shaped, beaked,\r\ncotyledons pistache green; embryos one or more; sections separating\r\nreadily from each other and from the rind; rind thin, oil cell somewhat\r\nballoon shaped or oval. Native to Cochin China. Generally admitted\r\nto be somewhat hardier than the sweet orange.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mandarin is the only species in the genus Citrus that has been\r\nat all systematically planted and cared for, even though this mostly\r\nconsists in the planting the trees, now and then the clearing away of\r\nthe weeds with cutlasses and the harvesting of the fruit. Nevertheless\r\nthe quality of the fruit is uniform and very good.\r\n\r\nThe mandarin district of the Philippines is confined to a small\r\narea principally around Santo Tomas and Tanauan, in the Province of\r\nBatangas, and, excepting imported fruit, all mandarins marketed in the\r\nPhilippines are grown in the above-mentioned region. Scattered trees\r\nare found in most parts of the Archipelago. Aside from the tizon,\r\nwhich is described later, and which it is believed may be referred\r\nto this species, there are no well-defined varieties of the mandarin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitrus nobilis var. papillaris Blanco. Tizon.\r\n\r\n(Plate II, b)\r\n\r\nA spreading, small tree, attaining a height of 6 meters or more, in\r\nhabit similar to the pomelo; spines small, or wanting; leaves 10 to\r\n14 centimeters long, 5 to 6 centimeters broad, ovate to elliptical\r\noblong, crenate, dark-green and shining above, crinkly, base broadly\r\nacute, apex narrowly acute to almost acuminate and caudate; petioles\r\n17 to 20 millimeters long with narrow wing margin; flowers not seen;\r\nfruit large from 6 to 10 centimeters in diameter, 170 to 580 grams in\r\nweight, somewhat compressed at basal half, usually ending in a more\r\nor less conspicuous nipple which, however, is sometimes wanting; apex\r\nflattened, or even depressed; surface smooth, pale greenish turning\r\nto orange yellow; skin medium thin; locules 10 to 11, separable from\r\neach other and the skin like the mandarin; pulp yellowish, subacid,\r\nvery juicy, and of good flavor with marked \"quinine\" taste; juice\r\ncells large; seeds very few, rarely more than 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tizon is extremely rare and only a few trees are found in\r\ncultivation, confined to the citrus district of Batangas, Luzon. The\r\ntrees are said to be quite prolific, and the fruit matures from\r\nSeptember to December. This fruit, on account of its scarcity, is of\r\nno commercial importance. However, it would be an acceptable dessert\r\nor breakfast fruit, being a little more acid than the orange. It is\r\nsaid to be an introduction from Spain. The tizon is without doubt\r\nthe C. papillaris described by Blanco in \"Flora Filipinas.\"\r\n\r\nThe tizon is believed to be a natural hybrid between the mandarin\r\nand the pomelo. It has inherited the loose-skinned character, large\r\njuice cells, and partial absence of spines, and leaf character of the\r\nfirst-named species to which it is (without the writer having had the\r\nopportunity to examine the flowers) unquestionably more closely related\r\nthan to any other species in the genus. The tizon is represented in\r\nthe citrus collection at the Lamao experiment station under Bureau\r\nof Agriculture No. 744 and 745.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitrus decumana L. Pomelo.\r\n\r\nA tree 6 to 12 meters in height, with a rounded or conical head, and\r\na trunk upwards of 45 centimeters in diameter; bark smooth, grayish\r\nbrown; young leaves and shoots sparsely pubescent, light green;\r\nleaves ovate, blunt, pointed or rounded, emarginate, smooth, dark,\r\nglossy green, leathery, margin crenate; petioles articulated, broadly\r\nwinged; flowers produced singly or in cymose clusters of 2 to 20,\r\nsweet scented; calyx cupped, large; sepals 4 to 5, pointed; corolla\r\nwhite, 37 to 43 millimeters across; petals 4 to 5, slightly reflexed,\r\nfleshy, oblong; stamens 20 to 25; anthers large, abundantly supplied\r\nwith pollen, proterandrous; pistil stout; stigma when ripe covered with\r\na sticky, milky fluid; ovary 11 to 14 loculed; fruit large, oblate,\r\nglobose or pyriform, light lemon or orange colored; flesh grayish or\r\npink; juice sacs large, spindle shaped; flavor a mingling of acid,\r\nbitterness and sweetness or subacid; seeds large, light colored,\r\nwedge shaped or irregular, with prominent ridges surrounding broad,\r\nflat areas. Native to the Polynesian and Malayan Archipelagos.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pomelo is the most widely distributed species in the genus,\r\nbut here as in the orange the quality of practically all the fruit\r\nis wretchedly poor, dry and insipid with a very thick skin. With the\r\nexception of the panuban, described below, there are no variations\r\nworthy of notice in this genus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitrus decumana L. Pomelo, var. Panuban.\r\n\r\nA spiny tree, 3 to 4 meters tall of robust growth; young growth\r\npubescent; leaves 12 to 17 centimeters long, 4.7 to 8 centimeters\r\nwide, oblong ovate, crenate, coriaceous; base rounded; petiole 15\r\nto 23 millimeters long, wing margins narrow, at most 18 millimeters\r\nbroad, and cuneiform; flowers not seen; fruit 5.7 centimeters long, 7\r\ncentimeters in transverse diameter, oblate, with shallow apical cavity;\r\nsurface smooth, lemon yellow; skin very thin; pulp contained in 11 to\r\n12 locules, yellowish, fairly juicy, subacid, acidity and sweetness\r\nwell blended, aromatic and well flavored; seeds large, polyembryonic.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe panuban is said to bloom about New Year and the fruit ripens in\r\nSeptember to November; the trees are reported to be very prolific. The\r\npanuban has been reported only from Lias, Bontoc, where half a dozen\r\ntrees are said to grow. Possibly the panuban may be an accidental\r\nhybrid between the pomelo and the orange or mandarin; if it is\r\nsimply a mutation it is certainly one of the most striking in this\r\nspecies. However this may be, the pomelo character is strongly dominant\r\nin both the foliage and the fruit. Very well flavored, the fruit is\r\ntoo dry to be acceptable to a discriminating public, but it is not\r\nimprobable that under cultivation the juiciness would increase. In\r\nsuch a case the panuban might become a fruit of commercial importance.\r\n\r\nB. A. No. 5160 (Lias, Bontoc).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitrus mitis Blanco. Calamondin.\r\n\r\nA small, somewhat spiny tree, 4 to 6 meters tall; young growth\r\ngreenish; leaves elliptic oblong, 4 to 9 centimeters long and about\r\n4 centimeters wide, crenulate; base acute; apex usually emarginate;\r\npetiole scarcely winged, 10 to 15 millimeters long; flowers axillary,\r\nsolitary, rarely in pairs, 21 millimeters in diameter, fragrant;\r\npetals white, reflexed; stamens 18 to 20, unequal; filaments united\r\ninto groups; ovary globose, 6 to 8 loculed; style slender, distinct;\r\nstigma knoblike; fruit globose, orange yellow, 2 to 4 centimeters\r\nin diameter; skin smooth, thin, brittle, separable from the flesh;\r\npulp orange colored, juicy, acid, with distinct aroma; juice cells\r\nrather large, short, and blunt; seeds comparatively large, smooth,\r\nplump, sometimes beaked; polyembryonic.\r\n\r\nThe calamondin is widely distributed in the Philippines and occurs wild\r\nas well as cultivated. The plant makes an attractive, ornamental,\r\nsmall tree and the fruit may be made into marmalade or utilized\r\nin making ade. There are no particularly distinct forms of this\r\nspecies. The trees are almost invariably very prolific and almost\r\neverbearing. In Bohol the species is known as \"limoncito.\"\r\n\r\nB. A. No. 2332 (Tanauan, Batangas).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitrus webberii. Alsem.\r\n\r\nA shrubby tree with small, sharp spines; leaves averaging 95\r\nmillimeters in length, and 32 millimeters in width, oblong-ovate,\r\ncrenulate, dark green and shining above; base broadly acute; apex\r\nemarginate, petiole 27 millimeters long; wings rarely exceeding 12\r\nmillimeters in width; flowers terminal, rarely axillary, solitary,\r\n20 millimeters in diameter, sweet scented; calyx small; petals white,\r\nreflexed; stamens 19 to 21, about equal; filaments united into groups\r\nof several; ovary small, obovoid, 7 to 11 loculed; style distinct,\r\nslender; stigma small, club shaped; fruit sometimes attaining a weight\r\nof 165 grams, form oblate, 58 millimeters long to 65 millimeters long\r\nto 66 across, to roundish oblate, sometimes compressed and wrinkled\r\ntoward base ending in a pronounced nipple; apex a shallow depression,\r\nor mammilate with the circular depression more or less pronounced;\r\nsurface smooth to fairly smooth; color greenish yellow to lemon yellow,\r\nlenticels few, depressed; skin thin, the \"kid-glove\" character more\r\nor less pronounced; flesh whitish to grayish, very juicy, aromatic;\r\njuice cells variable, from short and blunt to medium slender and\r\ntapering to one end; seeds ovate, flattened, smooth, sometimes beaked.\r\n\r\nPlants of the alsem have never been seen by the writer in the\r\nprovinces, the description of the plant having been made from\r\nbudded plants growing at Lamao, propagated from material collected\r\nin Bulacan. The trees have a long flowering season, as fruits are\r\noffered in Manila throughout the summer to late in autumn. The\r\nvariation in the fruit is very great, some being of little value,\r\nwhile others are extremely thin skinned, well flavored, juicy,\r\naromatic, with less rag than perhaps any citrus fruit that has been\r\nexamined by the writer. The floral characters correspond closely to\r\nthose of the mandarin, which the fruit in some forms also resembles\r\nin appearance and in its loose-skinned character. Flavor and aroma\r\nplace the alsem in close relationship with the cabuyao, C. histrix,\r\nand it is a curious fact that the Tagalogs always call it \"cabuyao.\" In\r\ncommon with the cabuyao it is frequently infested with the rindborer,\r\nPrays citri, while the mandarin is practically immune to this pest.\r\n\r\nAn analysis made by the Bureau of Science in November, 1912, of alsem\r\nfruits purchased by the writer in Manila gave the following results:\r\n\r\n\r\n                Weight of--      Grams.\r\n\r\n                Fruit             56.5\r\n                Peel              15\r\n                Seed               1.5\r\n                Pulp (rag)        13.5\r\n                Juice             26.5\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis of juice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Per cent.\r\n\r\n                Acidity (citric)      5.41\r\n                Sucrose               None.\r\n                Sugar                 2.41\r\n                Protein                .33\r\n                Ash                    .39\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis of pulp.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Per cent.\r\n\r\n                Acidity (citric)      2.73\r\n                Protein               1.03\r\n                Ash                    .58\r\n\r\n\r\nThe alsem was considered a variety of the mandarin in Bulletin No. 27,\r\nPlate IV, but a closer study of the plant and fruit shows that it\r\ndiffers so greatly from all other Philippine species of the genus as\r\nto be entitled to specific rank, and it has been named in honor of\r\nDr. H. J. Webber, director of the citrus experiment station, Riverside,\r\nCalifornia, the association with whom, in connection with his citrus\r\nand pineapple breeding work, more than any other cause influenced\r\nthe writer to take up the improvement of tropical economic plants.\r\n\r\nThe Bontoc local name \"alsem\" is here proposed as the vernacular name\r\nfor C. webberii. In previous publications by the writer it was called\r\nthe \"mandarin lime,\" which is hardly suitable, however, since while\r\nit has certain resemblances to the mandarin yet is distinct from it,\r\nand again, its only resemblance to the lime lies in its acidity and\r\nade-making qualities; moreover the name \"mandarin lime\" is too long\r\nfor popular use.\r\n\r\nB. A. No. 853 (Bulacan), 2275 (Manila), 4292 (Bontoc).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitrus webberii var. montana. Cabugao.\r\n\r\nA shrubby tree with slender branches and small, weak spines, sometimes\r\nabsent; young growth green; leaves 8.5 to 14 centimeters long, 3 to\r\n3.5 centimeters broad, ovate to ovate oblong, crenate, dark green\r\nabove, shining; base broadly acute to rounded; apex blunt pointed,\r\nusually retuse; petiole 24 to 38 millimeters long, with narrow wing\r\nmargin, in large leaves sometimes 17 millimeters broad; flowers not\r\nseen; fruit roundish oblate, about 45 millimeters across, somewhat\r\ncorrugate, 8 loculed.\r\n\r\nBudwood and fruits of the cabugao were forwarded to the Bureau by\r\nMr. A. M. Burton, from the Mountain Province. The writer did not\r\nhave the opportunity of examining the fruit, of which, however, an\r\nexcellent photograph was made, and, to date of writing the plants\r\nat Lamao not having bloomed there has been no chance to examine\r\nthe floral characters. The general character of the plant and fruit\r\nindicates that the cabugao is a form of the alsem.\r\n\r\nThrough a typographical error in Bulletin No. 27, Plate XVI (a),\r\nthe cabugao is credited to Bohol.\r\n\r\nB. A. No. 2266 (Benguet, Mountain Province).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitrus longispina. Talamisan.\r\n\r\n(Pls. IIa, IIIa.)\r\n\r\nAn arborescent, very thorny shrub about 5 meters tall, with numerous\r\nsuckers and interlocking branches, the spines on the stems frequently\r\n10 centimeters long; young growth bright green, nearly always angular;\r\nleaves 6.5 to 10 centimeters long, 3 to 4.8 centimeters broad, ovate\r\nto broadly elliptical, crenate; base obtuse to broadly acute; apex\r\nacute to rounded, usually emarginate; petioles 19 to 25 millimeters\r\nlong, rather narrowly winged, though in large leaves the wings are up\r\nto 18 millimeters broad; flowers not seen; fruit roundish, somewhat\r\nflattened at apex, 58 millimeters in diameter, smooth, deep lemon\r\ncolored; skin thin; locules 11 to 15; pulp very juicy, mildly acid,\r\nwith a tinge of orange yellow, aromatic and pleasantly flavored; juice\r\ncells large, plump, blunt or pointed at one end; seeds rather few,\r\nof medium size, fairly plump, more or less reticulate, polyembryonic,\r\nand of poor germinating qualities.\r\n\r\nThe talamisan is exceedingly rare, and is found in cultivation in Bohol\r\n(one plant has been seen in Cebu) and is fairly productive. Excepting\r\nthe mandarin, which is also of rare occurrence, it is much superior\r\nto all other citrus fruits grown in these two islands, and is eaten\r\nby the inhabitants; it is nevertheless very rare and of no economic\r\nimportance at present. The fruit ripens in January and February, and is\r\na poor keeper. Introduced into cultivation, the fruit of the talamisan\r\ncould to advantage be used as an ade fruit, and with a little sugar\r\nit would make a good breakfast fruit. The dense growth of the plant,\r\nwith numerous suckers, armed also with formidable spines, would make\r\nit a good live fence.\r\n\r\nThe talamisan, or tamisan as it is also called, is one of the\r\nmost interesting citrus fruits that has come to the attention of\r\nthe writer. Its angular growth, formidable spines, broad, sometimes\r\nalmost orbicular, distinct leaves and fruit easily distinguish the\r\ntalamisan from all other species in the genus.\r\n\r\nB. A. No. 2529, 4833 (Bohol).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitrus macrophylla. Alemow.\r\n\r\n(Pls. IIIb, VIc.)\r\n\r\nA tree attaining a height of 6 meters, of upright growth, and rather\r\nlong, stout, sharp spines; leaves 14 to 18 centimeters long, 6 to\r\n8 centimeters wide, elliptical to ovate, crenate to serrate; base\r\nrounded; apex acute; petioles 18 to 40 millimeters long, broadly\r\nwinged, wings frequently exceeding 35 millimeters in width; flowers\r\n4 to 7, in compact cymes, sessile, 18 to 22 millimeters in diameter;\r\ncalyx cupped; petals 4 to 5, oblong; stamens 26 to 30; filaments nearly\r\nalways free; ovary small, 13 to 16 loculed; style distinct; stigma\r\nclub shaped, small; fruit 85 to sometimes exceeding 100 millimeters in\r\nlength, attaining a weight of 500 to 800 grams, subglobose to roundish\r\noblong, more or less compressed towards base, which is nippled and\r\nwith stem inserted in a shallow cavity; apex flattened with a circular\r\ndepression around the raised stigmatic area; surface greenish lemon\r\nyellow, rather rough, with transverse corrugations; oil cells small,\r\nsunken; skin comparatively thin; pulp grayish, rather dry, sharply\r\nacid, lemon flavored; juice cells rather slender, long, and pointed;\r\nseed medium large, short and plump, smooth, sometimes beaked.\r\n\r\nThe alemow is a very rare fruit occurring in cultivation in Cebu,\r\nand considered inedible even by the natives. The description of the\r\nflowers was made from fresh specimens collected in May. The tree is\r\nsaid to bloom later in the year during the rainy season having then\r\nlarger flowers. Partly grown fruit was then seen on the tree and since\r\nmature fruit has been examined by the writer from December to late\r\nin February the alemow is evidently nearly if not quite everbearing.\r\n\r\nThe principal distinguishing features in this species are the large,\r\nbroad leaves, the comparatively short but quite broad-winged petioles,\r\nthe free rarely united filaments, and the quite large, peculiarly\r\nshaped fruit; it is thus apparently one of the links between the two\r\nbranches of the genus, one of which has the filaments more or less\r\nunited and the other the filaments free, being in the first group\r\nmost closely related to the pomelo.\r\n\r\nThe alemow was first forwarded to the writer under the name of colo:\r\nBulletin 27, Plate XIV.\r\n\r\nB. A. No. 2510, 2377, 3677, 4820 (Cebu).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitrus southwickii. Limao.\r\n\r\n(Pls. IIIe, IVc.)\r\n\r\nA thorny tree, with dense head and drooping branches, attaining\r\na height of 6 meters; spines small but sharp, leaves 9.5 to 14\r\ncentimeters long, 36 to 53 millimeters broad, ovate to roundish\r\novate, conspicuously crenate, dark green and shining above, leathery;\r\nbase acute; apex acute to obtuse, frequently emarginate; petioles\r\n35 to 70 millimeters long, the wings 25 to 30 millimeters broad in\r\nlarge leaves, the average wing area somewhat less than half of the\r\nleaf blade; flowers 2 to 6, in compact axillary or terminal cymes,\r\nsometimes solitary, 14 to 20 millimeters in diameter, white, with\r\ntrace of purple on the outside; calyx very small; stamens 22 to\r\n28, free; ovary globose to oblate; locules 15 to 19; stigma almost\r\nsessile; fruit 45 to 55 millimeters long, 55 to 65 millimeters in\r\nequatorial diameter, oblate, with shallow cavity at apex, smooth,\r\nwith slight longitudinal corrugations; lenticels sparse, small; oil\r\ncells usually raised; skin thin; pulp fairly juicy, sharply acid,\r\nbitter, with distinct aroma from C. histrix; juice cells short, plump,\r\ngranulate, small, containing a small, greenish nucleus; seeds numerous.\r\n\r\nThe limao, though rare, is not uncommon in Bohol, where it is\r\ncultivated and has also been collected by the writer in Baganga,\r\nMindanao. The flowers appear late in April and during the early\r\npart of May, with the fruit ripening in January and February; a few\r\nfruits nearly full grown were collected in May. No. 2049 has flowered\r\nirregularly from May to December. The fruit is not eaten, but used\r\nin washing by the Boholanos and is of no economic importance. The\r\ntree is evidently quite drought resistant, and succeeds well in very\r\nscanty soil underlaid with limestone.\r\n\r\nThe limao belongs in that group of the citrus fruits having free\r\nfilaments, the most conspicuous characters being the compact growth\r\nof the crown, the dark-green, thick, and distinct leaves, the almost\r\nsessile stigma, and the attractive, oblate, regular-shaped fruit\r\nwith its many locules, exceeding in number those in all other citrus\r\nfruits known to the writer. This species has been named in honor of\r\nMr. E. F. Southwick, elsewhere referred to in the paper.\r\n\r\nB. A. No. 2049 (Baganga, Mindanao), 2504, 4823 (Bohol).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitrus histrix DC. Cabuyao.\r\n\r\n(Pl. Vb; fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nA thorny tree, sometimes exceeding 6.5 meters in height; spines\r\nmedium large and sharp; leaves 13.5 to 18 centimeters long, 4 to 6\r\ncentimeters broad, ovate to oblong ovate, coriaceous, dark green and\r\nshining above, crenate; base rounded to broadly acute; apex acute,\r\nsometimes emarginate; petiole 5.5 to 8 centimeters long, broadly\r\nmargined, sometimes 4.5 centimeters wide, wing area inferior or\r\nequal to sometimes exceeding leaf area; flowers 4 to 7, in axillary or\r\nterminal, compact cymes, 17 to 28 millimeters in diameter; calyx small,\r\nnot cupped; petals 4 to 5, oblong ovate, white, with trace of purple\r\non the outside; stamens 30 to 36, equal, free, with abundant pollen;\r\novary rather large, globose, 13 to 18 loculed; style short and stout;\r\nstigma knob like; fruit subglobose to short pyriform or turbinate,\r\nattaining a length of 9 centimeters and a diameter of 7 centimeters;\r\nsurface smooth; color greenish yellow to lemon yellow; rind medium\r\nthick; pulp greenish, juicy, sharply acid, aromatic; juice sacs rather\r\nshort and blunt, usually containing a more or less distinct nucleus;\r\nseeds usually many, flat, reticulate.\r\n\r\nThis fruit, commonly called cabuyao by the Tagalogs in central Luzon,\r\nis without question the \"copahan\" of Bohol. Near Manila the tree\r\nhas been found in flower in September, while in Bohol flowers were\r\ncollected in May. The fruit may be used in making ade, but is inferior\r\nto the lemon or lime. The native inhabitants eat it together with fish,\r\nand also use the fruit in washing. It is of practically no importance.\r\n\r\nThe \"amongpong,\" found in Bohol, and considered a distinct fruit from\r\nthe copahan by the native inhabitants, differs chiefly in having only\r\n26 to 30 stamens, and a large oblate ovary with a short and slender\r\nstyle. The first has not been examined by the writer and is said to\r\nbe smooth and short, pyriform, 10 centimeters in diameter. Flowers\r\nexamined in May.\r\n\r\n\"Calo-oy\" is another fruit also found in Bohol considered by the\r\ninhabitants as distinct from the \"copahan\" and \"amongpong.\" The leaf\r\ncharacters in the calo-oy scarcely differ sufficiently to entitle\r\nit to rank even as a subspecies; the flowers were just gone when the\r\nvisit was made to Bohol. The fruit is said to be globose, smooth and\r\nabout 8 centimeters in diameter.\r\n\r\n\"Amontay\" (Pl. IVb) is still another form of C. histrix found in\r\nBohol. This plant was also out of its flowering stage at the time\r\nof the visit. The fruit, forwarded to the writer in February by\r\nMr. Southwick, is about 88 millimeters in diameter, irregularly\r\nglobose, with flattened or depressed base, and rounded apex, smooth,\r\nlemon yellow; oil cells mostly raised; skin thick; the pulp, contained\r\nin 10 to 12 locules, juicy, and rather pleasantly aromatic; juice\r\ncells medium large, short and plump, containing a minute, greenish\r\nnucleus; cotyledons supraterraneous, distinct.\r\n\r\nSo far as observed, the amongpong, amontay and the calo-oy are not\r\nsufficiently distinct from the cabuyao to entitle them even to rank\r\nas subspecies.\r\n\r\nThe various forms above referred to are in the Bureau of Agriculture\r\ncitrus collection at Lamao, represented as follows: Cabuyao, No. 739\r\n(Lamao); copahan, No. 2570, 4835 (Bohol); amongpong, No. 2496, 4831\r\n(Bohol); calo-oy, No. 4822 (Bohol); amontay, No. 2501, 4830 (Bohol).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitrus histrix var. boholensis. Canci.\r\n\r\n(Pls. IVa, Va.)\r\n\r\nA small tree, rarely exceeding 4 meters in height, with compact\r\ncrown and small, sharp spines; leaves 9 to 12 centimeters long,\r\n30 to 45 millimeters broad, ovate to elliptical ovate, crenulate,\r\ncoriaceous; base broadly acute; apex acute to acuminate; petioles\r\n35 to 45 millimeters long, 25 to 30 millimeters wide, wing area less\r\nthan one-half of leaf area; flowers 2 to 6 in compact axillary cymes;\r\npetals white, with purplish tinge outside; stamens 20 to 23, equal,\r\nfree; ovary quite large, oblate; locules 11 to 14; style short,\r\ndistinct; stigma knob like; fruit 39 millimeters long, 46 millimeters\r\nin transverse diameter, oblate, smooth, lemon yellow; oil cells\r\nnumerous, uniform, raised; skin medium thick; pulp quite juicy with\r\nvery pronounced acidity; juice cells short, plump, and granular;\r\nseeds many, wedge shaped, monoembryonic; cotyledons supraterraneous.\r\n\r\nThe canci is found in cultivation in Bohol and is rather rare. Flowers\r\nwere collected in May, and ripe fruits have been examined in\r\nJanuary. The fruit is eaten with fish by the Filipinos, but is really\r\nso little grown that it has no economic importance. The fruit makes\r\na fairly good ade.\r\n\r\nWhile the canci undoubtedly belongs to C. histrix yet an examination of\r\nits parts shows that it is very distinct from that species as already\r\ndescribed. In the leaves, the comparatively short petioles with small,\r\ncuneiform wings, as compared with the oblong-spatulate, broad-winged\r\npetioles in the cabuyao, etc., is very noticeable; the stamens are\r\n20 to 23 only in the canci, while the locules are 11 to 14, and the\r\nfruit is shorter than broad unlike that in C. histrix. Everything\r\nconsidered the plant is apparently an intermediate type between\r\nC. histrix and C. webberii.\r\n\r\nB. A. No. 2525, 4824 (Bohol).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitrus histrix var. torosa Blanco. Colobot.\r\n\r\nA spiny tree, attaining a height of 6 or more meters; young growth\r\ngreen with a tinge of purple; leaves 9 to 13 centimeters long, 3.5 to\r\n5.5 centimeters broad, ovate to short ovate, bicrenate, dark green and\r\nglossy; base rounded, apex emarginate; petiole 4 to 7.5 centimeters\r\nlong, 2.9 to 5 centimeters wide, oblong, with a broadly acute to\r\nobtuse base; wing area nearly equal to or frequently exceeding the\r\nleaf area; flowers 20 millimeters across, in axillary clusters of 2\r\nto 6; pedicel slender; calyx small, not cupped; petals 4 to 5, white,\r\nwith a tinge of purple on the outside; stamens 21 to 26, free, equal;\r\novary subglobose, 3 millimeters long, 11 to 14 loculed; style short,\r\n1 millimeter long, distinct; fruit 48 to 55 millimeters long, and\r\nabout 50 millimeters in transverse diameter, irregularly globose to\r\noblate, usually compressed towards base, ending in a small nipple,\r\nmore or less wrinkled, greenish lemon yellow; pulp greenish, fairly\r\njuicy, acid, scarcely edible; juice cells small, short, containing\r\na small greenish nucleus; seeds small, oblong, reticulate.\r\n\r\nThis plant is the C. torosa of Blanco, which has been considered a\r\nsynonym of C. histrix, and here raised to the rank of a subspecies. A\r\ncomparative study of C. histrix and the variety torosa shows\r\nconsiderable differences between the two. C. histrix is generally\r\nlarger in all parts; the wings of C. h. torosa are oblong, maintaining\r\nan almost equal width over a large part of the petiole, ending in a\r\nrounded to a broadly acute base, while in C. histrix, and in fact in\r\nall the species herein described with free stamens, the wings are more\r\nor less cuneate to elongate cuneate or oblong-spatulate, ending usually\r\nin an acuminate, sometimes an acute base, the one closest approaching\r\nthe C. h. torosa in this respect being the \"balincolong,\" referred\r\nto C. micrantha. The flower of C. h. torosa corresponds with that of\r\nC. histrix except that the former has 21 to 26 stamens as compared with\r\n30 to 36 in C. histrix, which also averages more locules to a fruit.\r\n\r\nB.

Vc, VIb, VIIc.)\r\n\r\nA tree attaining a height of 7.5 to 9 meters, with comparatively\r\nsmall but sharp spines; leaves 9 to 12 centimeters long, 27 to 40\r\nmillimeters broad, broadly elliptical to ovate, crenate, rather thin;\r\nbase rounded or broadly acute; apex acutely blunt pointed; petioles\r\n35 to 60 millimeters long, broadly winged, up to 40 millimeters wide;\r\nwing area sometimes exceeding leaf area; flowers small, 12 to 13\r\nmillimeters in diameter, white, with a trace of purple on the outside,\r\n2 to 5, in axillary or terminal cymes; petals 4; stamens free, equal,\r\n15 to 17; ovary obovoid, locules 6 to 8; style slender, distinct; fruit\r\n5 to 7 centimeters long, 3 to 4 centimeters in transverse diameter,\r\naveraging 26 grams in weight, obovate to oblong-obovate, somewhat\r\ncompressed towards base; apex blunt pointed; surface fairly smooth\r\nor with transverse corrugations, lemon yellow; skin comparatively\r\nthick; pulp rather juicy, grayish, acid; aroma similar to that of the\r\nsamuyao; juice cells short and blunt to long, slender and pointed,\r\nsometimes containing a minute, greenish nucleus; seeds many, flat,\r\npointed, more or less reticulate.\r\n\r\nThe biasong has been collected in Cebu, Bohol, Dumaguete, Negros, and\r\nin the Zamboanga and Misamis Provinces in Mindanao, in all of which\r\nit is sparingly cultivated. The flowers were described from material\r\ncollected in Bohol in May. Ripe fruit has been obtained in May, June,\r\nAugust, November, and February, indicating that the species is more\r\nor less everbearing. The fruit is used by the native inhabitants as\r\na hair wash, is not eaten, and is of no economic importance.\r\n\r\nParticularly noticeable in the biasong are the small flowers,\r\nwith less stamens than any other species, and the oblong-obovate,\r\nfew-loculed fruits.\r\n\r\nThe \"balincolong,\" by the Filipinos regarded as quite a different\r\nfruit, found in Bohol and in Misamis, Mindanao, is a more robust tree\r\nattaining a height of 12 meters, and has longer wings and thicker\r\nleaves, with smoother fruits which sometimes are almost round, but\r\nthese differences scarcely justify this form to rank as a subspecies\r\neven. Beginning in May, the balincolong (1982) has bloomed continuously\r\nat Lamao until date of writing (Dec. 18).\r\n\r\nBiasong, B. A.

VIIb.)\r\n\r\nA shrubby tree, 4.5 meters tall, with slender branches and small, weak\r\nspines; leaves 55 to 80 millimeters long, 20 to 25 millimeters broad,\r\novate to ovate-oblong or elliptical, crenulate, thin, of distinct\r\nfragrance, base rounded to broadly acute; apex obtuse, sometimes\r\nnotched, petioles 20 to 30 millimeters long, broadly winged, about 14\r\nmillimeters wide, wing area somewhat less than one-half of the leaf\r\nblade; flowers in compact axillary or terminal cymes, 2 to 7, small,\r\n5 to 9 millimeters in diameter, white, with trace of purple on the\r\noutside; calyx small, not cupped, petals 3 to 5; stamens 15 to 18,\r\nfree, equal; ovary very small, globose to obovate; locules 7 to 9,\r\nstyle distinct; stigma small, knob like; fruit 15 to 20 millimeters\r\nin diameter, roundish in outline; base sometimes nippled; apex an\r\nirregular, wrinkly cavity; surface corrugate, greenish lemon yellow;\r\noil cells usually sunken; skin very thin; pulp fairly juicy, acid,\r\nbitter with distinct aroma; juice cells very minute, blunt, containing\r\na small, greenish nucleus; seeds small, flattened, sometimes beaked.\r\n\r\nThe samuyao occurs sparingly in cultivation in Cebu and Bohol. Flowers\r\nwere collected in May, partly grown fruits were also obtained, and\r\nripe fruits have been collected in June, and from November to February,\r\nshowing that the plant is more or less everbearing. The fruit is used\r\nby the Filipinos as a hair wash, and is of no economic importance.\r\n\r\nThroughout, the samuyao gives an impression of dwarfness, by its\r\nsmall size, weak spines, small, and thin leaves; the flowers are even\r\nsmaller than in the biasong and the fruit is in all probability the\r\nsmallest in the genus.\r\n\r\nIn Bohol a somewhat more vigorous variety of samuyao was found which\r\nis named \"samuyao-sa-amoo.\" The fruits of samuyao-sa-amoo are a little\r\nlarger, and smoother, and longer than broad, otherwise similar to\r\nthe samuyao.\r\n\r\nSamuyao, B.

Citron.\r\n\r\nA shrub or small tree, about 3 meters high, with a short, indistinct\r\ntrunk and short, thick, irregular, straggling, thorny branches; bark\r\nlight gray; thorns short, sharp, rather stout; young shoots smooth,\r\nviolet colored or purplish, stiff; leaves large, 10 to 15 centimeters\r\nlong, oval oblong, serrate or somewhat crenate, dark green above,\r\nlighter beneath; flowers small, axillary, in compact clusters of 3\r\nto 10, often uninsexual; calyx small, cupped; corolla white within,\r\ntinged with purple on the outside; petals oblong, the tips incurved;\r\nstamens short, irregular in length, 40 to 45 in number; pistil small;\r\n[2] ovary 9 to 12 loculed or occasionally more; fruit lemon yellow,\r\nlarge, 15 to 22 centimeters long, oblong, rough or warty, sometimes\r\nridged; apex blunt pointed; rind thick, white, except for the outer\r\ncolored rim; pulp sparse; juice scant, acid, and somewhat bitter or\r\nsweetish; juice sacs small, slender; seeds oval, plump, light colored,\r\nsmooth. Probably native to India, or it may have been introduced there\r\nfrom farther east, China or Cochin China. Extremely sensitive to cold.\r\n\r\nThe citron is the rarest of all the old cultivated citrus in the\r\nPhilippines and is very seldom seen in the markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitrus medica var. odorata. Tihi-tihi.\r\n\r\n(Pl. VIIa.)\r\n\r\nA small, thorny shrub, seldom exceeding 2.5 meters in height, with\r\nsharp, stout spines; young growth bright green; leaves 7.5 to 11\r\ncentimeters long, 4.3 to 6.5 centimeters broad, elliptical, rather\r\nthick and leathery, serrate, of distinct fragrance; base rounded;\r\napex notched; petioles very short 4 to 6 millimeters long, not winged;\r\nflowers 1 to 4 in axillary compressed cymes, sessile, rarely exceeding\r\n38 millimeters in diameter; calyx large, prominently cupped; petals\r\n4 to 5, fleshy, white, with a tinge of purple on the outside; stamens\r\n36 to 42, unequal, shorter than stigma; filaments united in groups of\r\n4 to 6; pollen abundant; gynoecium frequently aborted; ovary elevated\r\non a bright green disk, large, 4 millimeters long, 13 to 14 loculed;\r\nstyle tapering from ovary, scarcely more slender, rather short;\r\nstigma large, knob like, and cleft; fruit 60 to 65 millimeters long,\r\n7 to 10 centimeters in transverse diameter, weighing 300 to 475 grams,\r\noblate, with a shallow basal cavity, and sometimes a mammilate apex,\r\nmore or less ridged longitudinally, fairly smooth, clear lemon yellow;\r\nlenticels scattered, depressed; oil cells large, equal or a trifle\r\nraised; skin rather thick; pulp grayish, rather dry, sharply acid,\r\nof lemon flavor; juice cells long and slender; seeds many--sometimes\r\n125 in a single fruit--short, broad, and flattened.\r\n\r\nThe tihi-tihi is a rare plant found in cultivation in Cebu and Bohol;\r\none plant has been seen in Misamis, Mindanao. The plant is very\r\nprecocious, fruiting as early as the third year from seed, everbearing,\r\nand is used by the Filipinos in washing the hair. It is not eaten,\r\nand is of no commercial importance.\r\n\r\nThe tihi-tihi differs from the citron in its green, tender, highly\r\naromatic growth, the leaves having been found to contain 0.6 per\r\ncent essential oil as analyzed by the Bureau of Science. The fruit\r\nis strikingly different from the citron.\r\n\r\nB. A. No. 19 (Cebu).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitrus medica var. nanus.\r\n\r\nA small, thorny shrub, rarely exceeding 2 meters in height, with small,\r\nsharp spines; leaves 7 to 11 centimeters long, 2.5 to 4.5 centimeters\r\nbroad, narrowly oblong ovate to elliptical oblong, serrate, darker\r\nabove than beneath; base rounded; apex frequently notched; petiole\r\n5 to 7 millimeters long, wingless; flowers 2 to 10, in axillary or\r\nterminal, rather loose cymes, 3 to 4 centimeters in diameter; calyx\r\nlarge, cupped; petals linear oblong, with tips slightly incurved,\r\nwhite, with trace of purple on the outside; stamens 36 to 50, unequal;\r\nfilaments usually united into groups, sometimes free; gynoecium\r\nsometimes wanting; ovary large, oblong, 10 to 12 loculed; style\r\nnot distinct, of nearly the same thickness as ovary; stigma large,\r\nsuperior to anthers, knob shaped; fruit 65 or more millimeters long,\r\n55 millimeters in diameter, ellipsoid to almost roundish, pointed\r\nat apex, lemon yellow, smooth; rind medium thick; pulp grayish to\r\ngreenish, acid, rather dry; juice cells long and slender, almost\r\nlinear; seeds many, rather small, flattened, smooth.\r\n\r\nThe plant is rather common in the Archipelago, and has been noted in\r\nTarlac, Pampanga, Bulacan, Laguna, and Cebu. It is frequently grown\r\nand fruited in small pots, and is probably the smallest species in\r\nthe genus. It is surprisingly productive and precocious, fruiting as\r\nearly as the second year from seed, and is practically everbearing. The\r\nfruit is eaten by the Filipinos but is too dry to be cultivated for\r\nthe flesh and the skin is too thin for utilization as citron peel.\r\n\r\nB. A. No. 27 (Cebu), 2384 (Laguna).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitrus limonum Risso. Lemon.\r\n\r\nA small tree 3 to 6 meters in height, with rather open head of\r\nshort, round or angular branches, thorny; bark grayish; young shoots\r\npurplish, smooth; leaves evergreen, alternate, 50 to 75 millimeters\r\nin length, ovate oval, sharp pointed, light green, margin serrate;\r\npetioles entirely wingless; flowers solitary, occasionally in pairs,\r\naxillary, on distinct peduncles; calyx persistent, segments 4 or 5;\r\ncorolla large, 38 to 50 millimeters across, white inside, purplish\r\noutside; petals oblong, spreading, strongly reflexed; stamens 20 to 26,\r\nseparate, or more or less united in small groups; ovary considerably\r\nelevated on a prominent disk, 7 to 10 loculed; fruit ripening at all\r\nseasons, ovoid or oblong, and pointed at both base and apex, about\r\n75 millimeters long, smooth or rough, light yellow in color; rind\r\nthin, flesh light colored; pulp acid; juice sacs long and pointed;\r\nseeds oval, pointed at the micropylar end, quite smooth. Native of\r\nthe same regions as the citron.\r\n\r\nThe true lemon is very rarely cultivated in the Philippines and all\r\nlemons used are imported from California, Australia and Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitrus pseudolimonum. Colo-colo.\r\n\r\n(Pl. VIIa.)\r\n\r\nA thorny shrub, 3 meters tall, with interlocking branches, and short,\r\nsharp spines; leaves 8 to 11 centimeters long, 40 to 45 millimeters\r\nbroad, elliptical to oblong-ovate, crenulate to serrulate; base\r\nrounded; apex obtuse, frequently slightly notched; petioles 18 to\r\n25 millimeters long, with narrow wing margin, rarely exceeding 10\r\nmillimeters in width; flowers 1 to 5, in terminal or axillary short\r\ncymes, 28 to 35 millimeters in diameter, white, purplish outside;\r\ncalyx cupped; stamens 30 to 37, nearly always free, unequal; ovary\r\nbroadly obovoid, 14 to 18 loculed; style distinct; fruit roundish\r\nto pyriform, small, usually compressed at base; apex irregular;\r\nsurface greenish lemon, more or less corrugate; oil cells raised;\r\nskin comparatively thick; pulp acid; juice cells small, short and\r\nplump; seeds undeveloped and sterile.\r\n\r\nThe colo-colo is another of these peculiar Philippine species with\r\nmore or less winged petioles affiliated to the lemon, etc. Flowers\r\nwere collected in May, and ripe fruit has been examined in January\r\nand February. The nearly always free stamens in a plant belonging to\r\nthe same general group as the lemon is of interest.\r\n\r\nNear the colo-colo is the \"lombog,\" considered a distinct fruit, also\r\nfound in Bohol. This variety is less vigorous than the colo-colo and\r\nalso differs from the plant in having narrower wing margins and 21\r\nto 28 stamens and 9 to 11 locules. The fruit is said to be about 4.5\r\ncentimeters in diameter and similar in shape to that of the colo-colo.\r\n\r\nThe \"kunot\" is a third variety considered distinct by the Boholanos\r\nthat also may be referred to C. pseudolimonum.\r\n\r\nTo C. pseudolimonum may perhaps also be referred a thorny, arborescent\r\nshrub, attaining a height of 4.5 meters, found in Siquijor, a little\r\nisland south of Negros. Material of this was collected in August,\r\n1912, by the writer, at which time the tree bore partly grown, oblong,\r\nrough, small fruits. The plants at Lamao have flowered during the last\r\ntwo months but have not set fruit. The principal difference in this\r\nvariety from the colo-colo and lombog is in the number of stamens,\r\nhere 36 to 41.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of C. pseudolimonum have no economic value.\r\n\r\nColo-colo, B.

Lime.\r\n\r\nA shrub or tree of straggling habit, with small, stiff interlocking\r\nor drooping, thorny branches, the thorns small, sharp, numerous; bark\r\ngrayish brown; young branchlets light green, becoming darker with age;\r\nleaves elliptic-oval, glossy green in color, margin slightly indented;\r\npetioles margined; flowers small, produced in axillary clusters of 3\r\nto 10; calyx small, four to five pointed; corolla white on both inner\r\nand outer surfaces; petals 4 to 5, oblong, fleshy; stamens small, 20\r\nto 25, united in a number of groups; ovary about 10 loculed; fruit\r\nrounded or oblong, frequently mammilate, light yellow; rind thin;\r\npulp greenish, acid; juice sacs small, slender, pointed; seeds small,\r\noval, pointed. Native to India and southeastern Asia.\r\n\r\nThe lime, in Luzon known as \"dayap,\" ranks third in importance among\r\nthe citrus fruits cultivated in the Philippines, and now and then\r\nexcellent fruit is found in the market, showing what could be done in\r\ngrowing first-class fruit if pains were taken to do a little selection\r\nwork and plant budded trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitrus limetta var. aromatica.\r\n\r\nA spiny shrub, with rather slender, willowly, drooping branches,\r\nand sharp spines; young growth light green, of pleasant and distinct\r\nodor when bruised; leaves 7.5 to 10 centimeters long, 3.5 to 5\r\ncentimeters broad, ovate oblong to elliptical, serrate to crenate,\r\ndull green above; base rounded to broadly acute; apex frequently\r\nnotched; petiole 6 to 19 millimeters long with a narrow wing margin;\r\nflowers solitary or in cymes to 4, terminal or axillary, 28 to 35\r\nmillimeters across; calyx rather large, cupped; petals 4 to 5, white\r\nwith a trace of purple on the outside; stamens unequal, 28 to 32,\r\nmore or less united; ovary large, oblong, 12 to 13 loculed; style not\r\ndistinct as in C. aurantium but rather similar to that in C. medica,\r\na trifle more slender than the ovary; fruit 5 centimeters long, 4 to\r\n4.5 centimeters across, roundish to roundish oblong, lemon yellow,\r\nsmooth; skin thin; pulp pale green, juicy, sharply acid, sometimes\r\nalmost bitter; juice cells long, slender and pointed; seeds very\r\nnumerous, small and plump, polyembryonic.\r\n\r\nThis form seems to be fairly well distributed and material has been\r\npropagated at Lamao from such distinct points as Mindoro, Palawan and\r\nBenguet. Unquestionably a lime, it is quite distinct from the ordinary\r\nlime in habit, and in the aromatic tender foliage and purplish-petaled\r\nflowers on the outside, which are larger than those in the lime,\r\nthe number of stamens also exceeding those of the lime.\r\n\r\nB. A. No. 741 (Palawan), 1749 (Mindoro), 2182 (Benguet).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitrus excelsa. Limon Real.\r\n\r\nA thorny, tall shrub of vigorous growth, straggly habit and\r\ninterlocking branches, with stout, long, sharp thorns; young growth\r\npurplish; leaves 9.5 to 16 centimeters long, 4.5 to 7 centimeters\r\nwide, elliptical oblong to ovate oblong, crenate to serrate, thick and\r\nleathery; base rounded; apex retuse; petiole 19 to 37 millimeters long,\r\nquite broadly winged, in large leaves the wings frequently exceeding\r\n2 centimeters in width; flowers 3 to 7, in axillary, rather loose\r\ncymes, 36 millimeters in diameter; calyx medium large, cupulate;\r\npetals showing trace of purple on the outside; stamens 34 to 35,\r\nunequal; filaments occasionally free, usually united into groups of 2\r\nto 6; ovary roundish, 10 to 14 loculed, 4.5 millimeters across; style\r\ndistinct, 5 millimeters long; stigma large; fruit 5 to 7.3 centimeters\r\nlong, 5.5 to 7.5 centimeters in equatorial diameter, weight 115 to 225\r\ngrams; form subglobose; base rounded; apex flattened; surface smooth,\r\ngreenish to clear lemon yellow; skin thin; pulp greenish to grayish,\r\nin good varieties very juicy, mildly acid, and of excellent flavor;\r\njuice cells long, slender and pointed.\r\n\r\nPlant material of the limon real has been collected in Tarlac, Bontoc,\r\nand Bohol, and the fruit is at rare intervals offered for sale in\r\nsmall quantities in Manila.\r\n\r\nThe name of the plant, \"Royal lemon,\" indicates the esteem in which the\r\nfruit is held by the people, and while it is unfortunately true that\r\nmost fruits tested have been too dry to be of any value, yet in the\r\nbest types the fruits in quality and aroma surpass all lemons and limes\r\nthat the writer has had the opportunity to sample. With its robust,\r\nthorny growth, large leaves and broad-winged petioles and considering\r\nits affinity to the lime and lemon together with the roundish oblate\r\nfruit with 34 to 35 stamens as against the 20 to 26 in those species\r\nand with its 10 to 14 locules, this plant is apparently as distinct\r\nfrom the lemon and lime as these species are from each other.\r\n\r\nB. A. No. 1727 (Bontoc?).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitrus excelsa var. davaoensis.\r\n\r\nA thorny, arborescent shrub of straggly habit, with interlocking,\r\ndrooping branches, and of vigorous growth; young growth green\r\nwith tinge of purple; leaves 8.5 to 13.5 centimeters long, 3.8 to\r\n5 centimeters wide, ovate to oblong ovate, crenulate to serrulate;\r\nbase rounded; apex sometimes retuse; petiole 16 to 30 millimeters long,\r\nwith wings ordinarily narrow, in large leaves sometimes 15 millimeters\r\nwide; flowers not seen; fruit 6.4 centimeters long, 8 centimeters\r\nin equatorial diameter, weighing 317 grams, oblate; base rounded;\r\napex flattened to depressed, wrinkled, with a circular depression\r\naround the raised stigmatic area; surface otherwise fairly smooth,\r\nlemon yellow; skin thin, central cavity large; pulp contained in\r\nabout 13 locules, light colored, quite juicy, sharply acid, and of\r\ngood flavor; juice cells long and slender.\r\n\r\nRipe fruit of this species has been received from Davao, Mindanao,\r\nin December and January. The fruit is perhaps too large for retail\r\ntrade, but might possibly be utilized in the manufacture of lime\r\njuice and allied products.\r\n\r\nFull-grown plants of C. excelsa or the variety above described have not\r\nbeen seen, but C. e. davaoensis appears to be smaller than C. excelsa\r\nin all respects, the fruits excepted. There has been no opportunity\r\nfor an examination of the flowers but so far as observed the plant\r\nappears more closely related to C. excelsa than any other species\r\nherein described.\r\n\r\nB. A. No. 1009 (Davao, Mindanao).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomic Value of the New or Little Known Species.\r\n\r\nThe horticulturist and plantbreeder, ever on the alert for new plant\r\nmaterial that may enhance his profits, extend the cultivable area of\r\nhis crop, or be used in making new cross combinations, will naturally\r\nask himself of what value are these new plants and fruits. Briefly\r\nstated, it may be said that the \"Tizon\" is a dessert or breakfast fruit\r\nof high, if not perhaps the highest, order, its main defect being\r\nthe unsightly basal projection. Then, as stated elsewhere, the best\r\n\"limon real\" is unsurpassed in quality for \"ade\" making. Perhaps third\r\nin importance are the better types of the alsem for the manufacture\r\nof citric acid, etc., and it might find a sale in competition with\r\nthe lemon and lime, depending to a great extent upon its keeping\r\nqualities. The juicy, thin-skinned, and few-seeded talamisan may find\r\nlovers as a breakfast fruit and is also of the right size for an ade\r\nfruit. If cultivation would increase the juiciness of the panuban,\r\nthis fruit may find favor with many. A good marmalade may be made of\r\nthe calamondin. The above species or varieties have more or less of a\r\nfuture on account of their pomological merits, and the plant breeder,\r\nby crossing them and the cabuyao and canci with old cultivated species,\r\nmight obtain valuable results.\r\n\r\nThere is also the prospective value of the new species as stocks. To\r\ndetermine the congeniality of these species and the old cultivated\r\ncitrus fruits and their value as stocks under various soil conditions\r\nwould of course require the labor and close observations of many years.\r\n\r\nThe calamondin is quite drought resistant and would probably dwarf\r\nthe scion. One year old buds of the pomelo, lime, mandarin and orange\r\nat Lamao have made satisfactory growth, the buds taking without\r\ndifficulty. The cabuyao is a very vigorous tree and is also drought\r\nresistant. It has recently been budded with the cultivated citrus\r\nfruits, the buds \"taking\" very well. The orange has been budded on\r\nthe alsem, resulting in a good growth, being now (December, 1914)\r\nnine months old. During the trip to Bohol in May, the limao, growing\r\nin a coraline lime-stone formation overlaid with a little humus,\r\nthe exact counterpart of the Bahama Islands or the \"hammock lands\"\r\nin southeast Florida, impressed the writer as one of the best examples\r\nof drought resistance among citrus fruits under such conditions. The\r\ntalamisan also appeared quite drought resistant, and is furthermore\r\nof value as a live fence because of its large spines.\r\n\r\nThe \"limon real\" is of great vigor and hence may be a desirable stock\r\nfor certain varieties and under certain conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY-PRODUCTS OF SUGAR MANUFACTURE.\r\n\r\nBy Cleve. W. Hines, M. S., Station Superintendent.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn various lines of manufacturing there are certain by-products which,\r\nyears ago, constituted a waste and great loss, but which now under\r\nmodern methods have become in many cases of considerable importance.\r\n\r\nThis is especially true with the sugar industry. Extreme care and\r\nattention is required to keep the balance on the right side of the\r\nledger, and often the proper handling of the by-products forms the\r\ndeciding factor between success and failure. In order to build up a\r\ngreat sugar industry in these Islands, more attention must be given\r\nto the details of the work, and many of the present losses must be\r\nturned into profits before great progress can be expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCane Tops and Trash.\r\n\r\nFirst in the series of by-products in the manufacture of sugar, comes\r\ncane tops. The amount of this material produced per hectare will depend\r\nupon various factors, including the variety of cane, its stage of\r\nmaturity, etc. The less of these tops, of course, that may be produced\r\nfor a given amount of cane, the better it will be for the growers,\r\nnevertheless they have a good feeding value if properly handled.\r\n\r\nProfessor Dodson, [3] director of the Louisiana Experiment Station,\r\nstates that he found cane tops to have the following composition:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       Per cent.\r\n                Protein                  1.53\r\n                Fat                      0.41\r\n                Carbohydrate            15.62\r\n                Fiber                    8.87\r\n                Water                   71.50\r\n                Ash                      2.07\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fiber content would be slightly higher and the water content lower,\r\nfor tropical cane, since maturity is completely reached before harvest\r\nbegins. It may be seen from the above analyses that this makes a most\r\nexcellent feed for work animals. Certainly greater advantage should\r\nbe taken of this feeding stuff than is usually done, since there is\r\na scarcity of pasturage near the end of the harvest season and the\r\nanimals become needlessly thin on account of lack of feed. At present\r\nvery little of this material is utilized, but instead is burned on\r\nthe field with the rest of the trash. If the tops are removed and\r\nused as a stock feed, only the leaves and pieces of stalk remain,\r\nand these make a good fertilizer for cane lands.\r\n\r\nIt is the general custom in these Islands to burn all of this material\r\nas soon as the crop is harvested. The object of this burning is to\r\ndestroy any insects that may be present, as well as to facilitate\r\nsubsequent cultivation. In the writer's opinion neither of these\r\nreasons is sufficiently well based, since in this country large numbers\r\nof troublesome cane insects are not found. If they were present in\r\nsufficient quantities, the trouble could be handled by placing the\r\ntrash between the rows and properly treating it before plowing it\r\nunder. This should be the method of disposing of the trash at all\r\ntimes. In this manner the waste material could be utilized, and the\r\norganic matter would be even more valuable than that contained in\r\nmany of the commercial fertilizers. The nitrogen contained, which\r\namounts to from 0.5 to 2 per cent, would be practically all saved,\r\nwhile with the burning method this is completely lost.\r\n\r\nIn Louisiana, cotton-seed meal forms one of the principal nitrogenous\r\nfertilizers for cane lands. This material costs from P50 to P75 per ton\r\nand Dr. Stubbs, [4] in his research, found that the trash burned from\r\neach ton of cane caused a loss of nitrogen equal to that contained\r\nin 27 pounds of cotton-seed meal. Besides this loss of nitrogen\r\nencountered in the burning of the trash, the organic matter which\r\nwould later form humus is completely destroyed. Soils would retain\r\nmoisture better during the dry season and be more easily handled if the\r\nconservation of organic matter were given greater attention. There is\r\nalso a great injury done to the remaining stumps and top roots by this\r\nburning which is very detrimental when the field is to be used for a\r\nratoon crop. Where cane is badly infested with destructive insects,\r\nit is quite another thing. This again brings up the fact that the cane\r\npoints should be treated with chemicals before planting, in order to\r\ncomplete the work of destroying these insects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUse of Ashes.\r\n\r\nThe ash of sugar cane constitutes the mineral matter that has been\r\ntaken out of the soil. This usually runs about 0.48 per cent of the\r\ntotal weight, according to Payson's classical analyses. Chemically\r\nthis contains the following: silica, iron, aluminum, lime, magnesia,\r\npotash, sodium, phosphorus, sulphur, chlorine, oxygen, water,\r\netc. Of these various elements, the phosphorus and potash are the\r\nmost valuable to the planter. Lime is also useful for many soils in\r\ncorrecting the acidity, and occasionally in supplying that element,\r\nwhen it happens to be lacking in a particular soil.\r\n\r\nThe cost of different fertilizers is governed by the percentage of\r\nthese plant-food elements contained. Phosphoric acid is worth $0.05\r\nper pound (P0.22 per kilo) in crude fertilizers. At this rate the\r\nvalue of this element recovered from a crop of 75 tons of cane per\r\nhectare would be from P10 to P12.\r\n\r\nPotash is valued at about P0.26 per kilo and that removed with a crop\r\nof 75 tons would cost about P25. The lime contained is a cheaper\r\nelement but will not act as a detriment on any soil, while on many\r\nit will be found very helpful.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the great deficiency in these elements in the cane\r\nlands here, and the high cost of commercial fertilizers, this waste\r\nmaterial is not only neglected at the majority of the factories but\r\nis actually thrown away, yet the same elements that command a high\r\nprice in commercial fertilizers are contained in these ashes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFilter-press Refuse.\r\n\r\nIn the defecation of cane juice, certain chemicals are often used\r\nto precipitate the impurities, which are removed from the subsiders\r\nafter the clear juice has been drawn off, and sent to the filter\r\npresses, where it is filtered through heavy cloths. This material\r\ncontains coarse particles of bagasse together with other impurities\r\nincluding the lime and phosphoric acid which were used in this\r\nwork. The composition of the material depends upon the original\r\ncomposition of the juice and the amount of the different chemicals\r\nthat has been used in the clarification. In any event, it makes a most\r\nvaluable fertilizer because of the organic matter, nitrogenous bodies,\r\nphosphoric acid, and lime that it contains. This organic material is\r\nan ideal substance to be applied to the worn-out cane lands (which\r\nconsist almost entirely of mineral substances) since it induces\r\nbacterial action, and during its decomposition certain acids are\r\nfreed, such as carbonic, nitric, and organic acids. These have the\r\npower to act upon the mineral constituents and thus liberate other\r\nplant-food elements. The filter-press mud can very well be mixed with\r\nthe bagasse ashes, and scattered about the cane rows as an almost\r\ncomplete fertilizer for sugar cane, the only element lacking being\r\nnitrogen, which was lost in the burning of the bagasse.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that in the synthesis of sucrose, which consists\r\nof carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, there are none of the plant-food\r\nelements used which are sought for in commercial fertilizers. These\r\nare used only in building the fibrous stalk of the cane and they may\r\nall be recovered in the bagasse and cane-juice impurities. The carbon,\r\nhydrogen, and oxygen which are used practically all come from the\r\nair and water.\r\n\r\nIt is a custom to-day to cart this ash to piles or depressions some\r\ndistance from the factory. In some places it is thrown into the river,\r\nor cast into the sea--an absolute loss.\r\n\r\nPlanters must not depend upon commercial fertilizers for their supply\r\nof plant-food material, when there is such an abundance of natural\r\nfertilizer being wasted. The cost of the artificial fertilizers in\r\nmany cases is considered prohibitive and often unnecessary. In order\r\nto build up a great sugar industry here, the material at hand must be\r\nused, while money should be spent for modern apparatus and equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMolasses.\r\n\r\nThe dark-colored viscous substance remaining after the large crystals\r\nof sucrose have been removed is called molasses. This contains small\r\ncrystals of sucrose, which has passed through the perforations of\r\nthe centrifugal screens, sucrose in solution, glucose, fructose,\r\nand other organic substances, such as pectin bodies, albumenoids,\r\ncoloring substances, etc., besides the inorganic matter constituting\r\nthe ash upon incineration of the molasses.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the molasses varies with the working of each\r\nfactory, also with the condition of cane, time of harvest, etc. The\r\njuice from green cane and that which has reached ultramaturity will\r\ncontain a higher percentage of invert sugar and organic non-sugars than\r\na properly matured cane. Then factories that have ample boiling-house\r\nprovision, and crystallizers as well as magma tanks, will be able to\r\nsend out a molasses with lower purity, thus recovering more of the\r\ncrystallizable sugar.\r\n\r\nIn any case there will be some molasses produced, and this constitutes\r\na valuable sugar-house by-product, if properly cared for. It may\r\nbe disposed of in one of several forms, namely, as a human food,\r\na stock feed, a source of alcohol, factory fuel, and a fertilizer.\r\n\r\nCane molasses as a human food.--For many years low-grade cane molasses\r\nhas been used as a human food in the United States. It was originally\r\nsold under the name of New Orleans molasses, but in recent years a\r\nnumber of companies have employed clarifying and bleaching agents and\r\nthus turned out a very fancy article, under various trade names, for\r\nbaking purposes. With the boiling at low temperatures practiced to-day,\r\nthere is little or no caramel formed during this work, and consequently\r\nit is only necessary to clarify and bleach the organic non-sugars, in\r\norder to make a salable molasses. The bleaching is usually accomplished\r\nby the use of a hydrosulphite, either in the form of sodium or calcium,\r\nbut sometimes only the sulphurous acid gas is used.\r\n\r\nThe bleaching effect of none of these reagents is permanent, especially\r\nwhen the product is exposed to the air and light. Such chemicals must\r\ntherefore be used with great caution, and as late in the process as\r\npossible. Care must be exercised too that an excessive amount is not\r\nemployed, since an undesirable tint is liable to result as well as\r\nan excessive amount of the sulphites to be admitted, which is not\r\npermitted by the Pure-Food Law. It is astonishing how much of this\r\nlow-grade molasses is thus manufactured and used in the United States\r\nfor cooking purposes, and what a high price this product commands.\r\n\r\nCane molasses as a stock feed.--Perhaps more of the exhausted molasses\r\nis used for this purpose in these Islands than for any other.\r\n\r\nOrdinary molasses contains from 30 to 35 per cent of sucrose and almost\r\nas much glucose. These being purely carbohydrates, it is necessary to\r\ncombine them with some protein-bearing feed in order to make a perfect\r\nration. Many leguminous plants, such as alfalfa, cowpeas, peanut vines,\r\netc., may be cut fine and used as an absorbent for molasses. This makes\r\na most excellent feed as it contains a sufficient amount of roughage,\r\nand at the same time offers a balanced ration if properly composed. In\r\nthis country there is a great amount of exhausted cake from the\r\ncoconut-oil factories, which is exported to Europe each year. There\r\nis no good reason why this should not be used as an absorbent for the\r\nmolasses in making a concentrated feed, which could be transported\r\nto various parts of the Islands or exported abroad for stock.\r\n\r\nTo-day the Philippines are dependent upon Australia and other countries\r\nfor many thousand head of cattle each year. The by-products from\r\nsugar factories are thrown into the rivers or flushed away from the\r\nfactories through drains, and the leaves and tops of the cane are\r\nburned on the ground in order to facilitate cultivation. In the attempt\r\nto grow our own beef, these feeds should be an important factor.\r\n\r\nCane molasses as a source of alcohol.--Alcohol can be made from a\r\ngreat variety of substances containing the necessary constituents,\r\nviz, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous alcohols possible, ethyl alcohol is the one ordinarily\r\nsought and the easiest produced. This alcohol is represented by the\r\nfollowing chemical formula: C2H5-OH.\r\n\r\nWhile glucose is the substance which may be easily transferred into\r\nalcohol by fermentation, sucrose may also be used, providing it is\r\nfirst changed into glucose or invert sugar. Even cellulose and starch\r\nmay be used after being transferred into reducing sugars.\r\n\r\nThe process of changing glucose into alcohol and carbon dioxide is\r\ncalled fermentation and is accomplished by a minute organism. Sucrose\r\nwill not directly ferment, consequently it must first be changed into\r\nglucose. This is usually accomplished by an enzyme which is secreted\r\nby a ferment.\r\n\r\nThe following chemical formula will serve to show the steps necessary\r\nto pass from sugar to an alcohol:\r\n\r\n\r\n    C12H22O11 (sucrose) + H2O (water) Presence of an\r\n         342 M. W.\r\n\r\n    enzyme -->                           Invert sugar\r\n                        ------------------------------------------\r\n                        (C6H12O6 (dextrose)    C6H12O6 (levulose))\r\n                              180 M. W.             180 M. W.\r\n\r\n    -->       C2H5-OH (ethyl alcohol) + 4CO2 (carbon dioxide)\r\n                   184 (2 M. W.)             176 CM. W.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theoretical yield then of alcohol from sucrose would be 53 per\r\ncent and from invert sugar 51 per cent. In practice, however, this\r\nyield would not be experienced on account of the yeast converting\r\nsome of the sugars into substances other than alcohol and carbon\r\ndioxide. These will consist mostly of glycerine and succinic acid\r\nand will amount to 4 or 5 per cent.\r\n\r\nSince the working conditions determine to a very great extent the\r\nyield of alcohol, it is obvious that a thoroughly efficient person\r\nshould be in charge of this work. In the selecting of cultures\r\nfor the fermenting, the manufacturer should use only the purest,\r\notherwise acetic acid and other foreign substances will be formed\r\nduring fermentation, thus decreasing the yield of the alcohol as well\r\nas lowering its purity.\r\n\r\nWhere the percentage of sucrose and glucose of a molasses is known,\r\nit is a simple matter to calculate the theoretical amount of alcohol\r\nto be recovered and by knowing the efficiency of the factory, a factor\r\nmay be obtained which multiplied by the theoretical yield will give\r\nthe true amount of alcohol to be expected. In this manner it is easy\r\nto determine the price that may be paid for any molasses.\r\n\r\nThe separation of the alcohol from the water and dirt (lees) is\r\naccomplished in an apparatus termed a \"still.\" In this the liquor is\r\nheated by steam which causes the alcohol to evaporate. Since ethyl\r\nalcohol boils at a temperature of 78 deg. or a little higher, depending\r\nupon the percentage present, it may be separated from the water and\r\nimpurities during the evaporation, and recovered from the coils of\r\nthe condenser in a fairly pure state.\r\n\r\nThere is always, however, more or less water vapor escaping with the\r\nalcohol and consequently it is impossible to secure absolute alcohol\r\nwithout after-treatment, although in the modern still a very high\r\ngrade is often recovered in the first distillation.\r\n\r\nIn this connection the strength of alcohol is usually determined by\r\nreferring it to \"proof,\" which is an old English system used before\r\nmodern methods of testing spirits were available. In its original\r\napplication, gunpowder was moistened with the spirit and the mixture\r\nsubjected to the flame of a match. When just enough alcohol was present\r\nto set fire to the powder, it was said to be \"proof spirit.\" If not\r\nenough alcohol was present to accomplish this, it was said to be\r\n\"under proof,\" and when the gunpowder was lighted easily by it,\r\nit was said to be \"over proof.\"\r\n\r\nBy an act of the English Parliament, the term \"proof spirit\" was\r\nfixed as one which contains exactly 12/13 of an equal volume of water\r\n(distilled) at 51 deg. F., which represents 57.1 per cent of alcohol by\r\nvolume, or 49.3 per cent by weight.\r\n\r\nThe simplest method of determining the percentage of alcohol is by\r\nthe use of a gravity spindle for liquids lighter than water, and by\r\nreferring to the accompanying table for this purpose, the percentage\r\nof alcohol may be ascertained.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Table for calculating the percentage of alcohol.

The burning of carbon consists\r\nin uniting oxygen to that element, forming carbon dioxide. When\r\nhydrogen burns, the oxygen combines with it, forming water. During\r\nthis oxidation, two atoms of hydrogen combine with one of oxygen,\r\nbut in the molecule of sugar, these two elements are already present\r\nin this proportion, consequently only the carbon may be oxidized\r\nand thus give off heat. This is found to be true also of sucrose,\r\nreducing sugars, and many organic compounds.\r\n\r\nAn instrument called a calorimeter is used to determine the amount\r\nof heat a substance will give off upon oxidation. Tests may be made\r\non molasses in order to determine its value as a fuel, and thus a\r\ncomparison may be obtained of a pound of this material and one of\r\ncoal having a standard value.\r\n\r\nThe ash from the molasses contains a great deal of potassium and some\r\nmagnesium, consequently care must be exercised in the burning of the\r\nmolasses so that this material does not come in direct contact with\r\nthe tubes of the boiler, since a heavy coating will be formed that\r\nwill greatly lower the coefficient of heat transmission.\r\n\r\nOn account of the high potash content, these ashes make a valuable\r\nfertilizer, which should be mixed with the bagasse ashes and mud cake,\r\nand applied to the cane lands.\r\n\r\nMolasses as a fertilizer.--While molasses is not used to any great\r\nextent as a fertilizer, there is no good reason why exhaustive\r\nexperiments should not be carried out with this by-product on\r\nPhilippine soils, when it is now being thrown into drains or wasted,\r\nuntil a better use is provided for the molasses.\r\n\r\nExperiments have been made in Hawaii, Mauritius, and other places\r\nwith this form of fertilizer, and very encouraging results were\r\nreported. The plant-food elements themselves contained in molasses\r\nare small in amount, since they are contained in the low percentage\r\nof ash after burning, except, of course, nitrogen, which will be\r\nentirely saved. Its main value, however, lies in the power to induce\r\nbacterial growth, which is so necessary in worn-out soils.\r\n\r\nAmong the organisms induced by these organic matters may be included\r\ncertain azotobacter species, which contrary to other forms of plant\r\nlife, have the power of using nitrogen from the air. Carbohydrates\r\nform especially good mediums for their development, and it has been\r\nfound that the activities of these organisms are increased by an\r\nincreased amount of this substance.\r\n\r\nWhile excellent results have been attained by the use of low-grade\r\nmolasses for fertilizer in other countries yet it remains for the\r\nplanters here to determine results under Philippine conditions, and\r\nthe best method of handling their material. In some places where\r\nirrigation water is applied, the molasses is mixed with the water\r\nand applied in the usual manner.\r\n\r\nThe plant-food material contained in molasses will vary somewhat with\r\nthe methods of its production, clarifying agents previously used, etc.\r\n\r\nThe following table will indicate the composition of ash from different\r\nmolasses: [6]\r\n\r\n\r\n==================================================================================\r\n                             |     1       |     2       |   3     |      4\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                             |    Mill     |  Diffusion  |  Open   |Carbonitation.\r\n                             |sulphitation.|sulphitation.| kettle. |\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                             |  Per cent.  |  Per cent.  |Per cent.| Per cent.\r\nPotash                       |    49.48    |     52.20   |  51.48  |    50.16\r\nSoda                         |      .89    |       .80   |   1.11  |      .32\r\nLime                         |     6.47    |      6.78   |   6.58  |     8.53\r\nMagnesia                     |     4.29    |      3.09   |   3.99  |     2.66\r\nIron oxide                   |      .35    |       .33   |    .15  |      .47\r\nAlumina                      |      .30    |       .22   |    .13  |      .30\r\nSilica                       |     4.12    |      4.59   |   2.83  |     4.10\r\nPhosphoric acid              |     3.71    |      3.80   |   2.12  |      .91\r\nSulphuric acid               |    10.79    |      6.72   |  10.94  |    11.18\r\nCarbonic acid                |     7.49    |     11.19   |  13.06  |    15.78\r\nChlorine                     |    14.00    |     11.95   |   9.10  |     4.59\r\n                             -----------------------------------------------------\r\n                             |   101.89    |    101.67   | 101.49  |    99.00\r\nDeduct O minus Cl.           |     3.16    |      2.70   |   2.05  |     1.04\r\n                             -----------------------------------------------------\r\n                             |    98.73    |     98.97   |  99.44  |    97.96\r\n                             -----------------------------------------------------\r\nUndetermined (carbon, etc.)  |     1.27    |      1.03   |   0.56  |     2.04\r\nAlkalinity (cc. tenth normal |             |             |         |\r\n    per gram ash) cc.        |       80    |        93   |     95  |      109\r\n==================================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to make a wise selection of the method of handling the\r\ndifferent by-products the manufacturer must take into consideration\r\nmany factors.

[7]\r\n\r\nBy P. J. Wester, Horticulturist in Charge of Lamao Experiment Station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreliminary Remarks.\r\n\r\nWhile it cannot be said that the Philippines have ever grown coffee\r\non a scale that made it an important factor in the world's market,\r\nyet, before the advent of the coffee blight, coffee growing, from a\r\nPhilippine point of view, was an industry of considerable magnitude\r\nand unquestionably of great promise. However, in the Philippines as\r\nin other parts of the eastern Tropics, the blight destroyed the coffee\r\nindustry, and while in the last few years previous to the appearance of\r\nthe blight there was an average annual export of about 7,000 tons of\r\ncoffee, valued at P4,000,000, in 1913 the Philippines produced only\r\n113,031 kilograms of Arabian coffee with an average production of\r\n174 kilograms per hectare, the coffee imports during the same period\r\namounting to 1,138,781 kilograms, valued at P816,744. The leading\r\ncoffee-producing provinces of the Archipelago were, during 1913, the\r\nMountain, 42,066 kilograms; Moro, 31,040 kilograms; Nueva Vizcaya,\r\n5,792 kilograms; and Batangas, 5,319 kilograms. Varying quantities\r\nof coffee, less than 5,000 kilograms in any one, were produced in\r\neach of the remaining provinces, excepting Agusan, Bataan, Batanes,\r\nIlocos Sur, Leyte, Pampanga, and Surigao, where coffee is not grown.\r\n\r\nFrom a study of the coffee situation in the Eastern Hemisphere it is\r\nevident that Arabian coffee will never again become of importance in\r\nthis part of the world, including of course the Philippines. However,\r\nit seems that a satisfactory substitute has been discovered in the\r\nrobusta coffee. This variety, while not immune to the blight, is so\r\nresistant to the effects thereof that the disease ceases to affect\r\nthe profits of the crop, or at least very slightly.\r\n\r\nThis and other reasons, which will be explained later, have resulted\r\nin the planting of robusta coffee on a very large scale in Java\r\nand adjacent Dutch possessions, and the reports relative to this\r\nvariety are such as to recommend it to the serious consideration\r\nof Philippine planters. The present paper has been prepared with a\r\nview of meeting the almost daily requests that reach this Bureau for\r\ninformation on the subject of coffee, and particularly to give some\r\ninformation relative to the robusta coffee, with which practically\r\nall planters in the Archipelago are unfamiliar. It might perhaps be\r\nwell to state that propagation, handling of the plants from the seed\r\nbed to the plantation, culture, etc., are the same for both Arabian\r\nand robusta coffee, except where so stated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArabian Coffee.\r\n\r\nThe decrease in the cultivation of coffee and the present status\r\nthereof in the Philippines show conclusively that Arabian coffee cannot\r\nbe profitably grown here below an altitude of 800 meters. At and above\r\nthis elevation the climate is so favorable for the growth of the plant\r\nthat when kept in good condition it is capable of resisting the attack\r\nof the blight sufficiently to yield a profitable crop. Nevertheless,\r\nthe planting of Arabian coffee on a large scale is not recommended\r\neven here, because the disease is everywhere present, waiting for\r\na favorable opportunity to spread, and a drought, typhoon, or in\r\nfact anything that would devitalize the plants, would be sure to\r\nrender them liable to a severe attack that might wipe out an entire\r\nplantation or district.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Arabian coffee grows below an altitude of 800 meters;\r\nin fact, coffee bushes are found at sea level, but a prospective\r\ninvestor should always remember that there is a very great difference\r\nbetween being able to merely grow coffee and to produce it in such\r\nquantities that its cultivation becomes profitable. This cannot be done\r\nat a low elevation. It is perhaps well to state here that exhaustive\r\nexperiments have so far failed to yield a fungicide or spray by which\r\nthe coffee blight can be satisfactorily controlled in the field.\r\n\r\nEverything considered then, only in certain districts of the Mountain\r\nProvince and on the table lands of Mindanao may Arabian coffee be\r\nsuccessfully and profitably cultivated to any considerable extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRobusta Coffee.\r\n\r\nRobusta coffee in Java.--When the blight appeared in Java, coffee\r\ngrowing was one of the most important industries in that island, and\r\nafter the plantations had been destroyed by the disease, the Dutch\r\nGovernment, having failed to control the blight by repressive measures,\r\ninstituted investigations with a view of discovering a blight-resistant\r\ncoffee, in the course of which work several species were introduced and\r\ntested. Among these were Liberian coffee (Coffea liberica) and robusta\r\ncoffee, considered by Wildeman to be a variety of Coffea canephora.\r\n\r\nRobusta coffee was discovered in the Belgian Congo, and seeds were sent\r\nto Brussels, Belgium, and propagated, where plants were first offered\r\nfor sale in 1901. Some of these plants found their way to Java. Like\r\nmost new introductions the robusta coffee was at first looked upon\r\nrather askance, but as its greater climatological range as compared\r\nwith that of Arabian coffee, and its productivity, precocity, and\r\nresistance to the coffee blight (Hemileia vastatrix) became apparent,\r\nit rapidly gained popularity--so rapidly in fact that the Javanese\r\ncoffee plantations today consist almost entirely of robusta coffee. The\r\nfact that in 1909 the total crop of robusta coffee was only 183,000\r\nkilograms, and that in 1911 9,650,000 kilograms were produced, with\r\nan estimated yield of 16,000,000 kilograms for 1912, and that during\r\nthe period from 1907 to 1911, 24,521,000 robusta coffee plants were\r\nplanted, is ample proof of its popularity in the Dutch East Indies.\r\n\r\nIntroduction into the Philippines.--Robusta coffee has not been\r\nintroduced into the Philippines to any extent. Bearing trees are\r\nreported from Basilan, near Zamboanga, and a few plants are also\r\ngrowing at the Lamao experiment station in Bataan. The latter are in\r\ngood condition with no indication of blight.\r\n\r\nSoil and climate.--Robusta grows well from sea level to an altitude\r\nof 1,000 meters, doing best at an elevation ranging from 450 to\r\n750 meters.\r\n\r\nLess particular than Arabian coffee, the robusta thrives well\r\non both light and heavy soils provided they have the necessary\r\nfertility. However, good drainage is essential for a good growth and\r\ntherefore robusta should not be planted on sticky and very heavy,\r\nwater-holding soils. Poor and sandy soils should also be avoided. This\r\nvariety is also somewhat sensitive to drought and should be planted\r\nonly where the rainfall is fairly evenly distributed, and where the\r\ndry season is of comparatively short duration. Generally speaking,\r\nwhere the soil conditions are favorable, the cacao, abaca, and coconut\r\ngrowing districts of the Archipelago are perhaps better adapted than\r\nother sections to the culture of robusta coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCulture.\r\n\r\nPropagation.--The place selected for seedbed and nursery should be\r\nwell drained, with a loamy soil, the richer in humus the better. A\r\nlight bamboo frame should be erected above the nursery plot about\r\n2.5 meters high, and covered with grass or split bamboo to provide\r\nabout half shade. The land should be spaded thoroughly to a depth of\r\n30 centimeters, and all stones, roots, etc., removed. One meter is\r\na convenient width for seed and plant beds.\r\n\r\nThe seeds should be sown broadcast, not too thick, covered with not\r\nmore than 1 centimeter of earth, and then watered thoroughly. Hereafter\r\nthe seedbed should be well watered from time to time whenever the\r\nsoil appears dry. Frequent light sprinklings that do not allow the\r\nwater to penetrate more than a few millimeters below the surface are\r\nharmful rather than beneficial both in the seedbed and the nursery,\r\nin that they encourage a shallow root formation.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first leaves are fully expanded the seedlings should\r\nbe transplanted to the nursery beds, which should be prepared like\r\nthe seedbed. If the land is poor it is well to spade in a liberal\r\nquantity of well-decayed manure or compost. The plants should be taken\r\nup carefully, the taproot nipped off with the thumb nail, and then\r\ntransplanted with the aid of a pointed stick or small dibber spacing\r\nthem 10 to 15 centimeters apart each way. In doing this care should\r\nbe taken that the roots are not doubled up in the hole and that the\r\nsoil is well packed around them. More plants should never be removed\r\nat one time from the seedbed than can be conveniently transplanted\r\nbefore they show signs of wilting, and the dug plants should not be\r\nleft exposed until the roots dry out. The plants should be thoroughly\r\nwatered before and after transplanting, and the beds kept free from\r\nweeds and watered as often as necessary.\r\n\r\nClearing and planting.--Wherever possible, the land to be planted\r\nin coffee should be stumped, and plowed once or twice, so that after\r\nthe plants have been set out animal-drawn cultivators can be used to\r\nkeep down the weeds. Thus the cost of weeding is lessened during the\r\nearly years of the plantation while the plants are small. If plowing\r\nis not feasible holes 1 meter in diameter and at least 30 centimeters\r\ndeep should be grubbed where the plants are to be set.\r\n\r\nOn moderately rich land robusta coffee should be planted 2.1 meters\r\napart each way, 2,265 plants to the hectare; on very fertile land\r\nthe distance may be increased to 2.5 meters, or 1,600 plants to\r\nthe hectare.\r\n\r\nArabian coffee should be spaced from 2 to 2.5 meters apart or on poor\r\nlands even closer.\r\n\r\nWhen the plants are 4 to 5 months old they should be about 20\r\ncentimeters tall and ready for transplanting. About one-half of the\r\nfoliage should now be cut off; a trench should be dug at the end\r\nof the nursery bed about 20 centimeters or more deep; then a thin,\r\nsharp spade or bolo (cutlass) should be passed through the soil,\r\nunderneath and around the plant, neatly severing all straggling roots,\r\nand leaving the plant in the center of a ball of earth. The plants\r\nshould be set out in the field at the same depth at which they grew\r\nin the nursery, great care being taken not to break the ball. If the\r\nsoil is so loose that it falls away from the roots in the removal\r\nfrom the nursery, great care should be exercised in not allowing the\r\nroots to dry out and in setting out the plant so that the roots fall\r\nin a natural position. In the course of the planting the soil should\r\nbe firmly packed about the roots.\r\n\r\nThe sowing of the seed in a given locality should be so timed that the\r\nplants are ready for transplanting at the beginning of the rainy season\r\nin order to avoid the expense of artificial watering. If transplanted\r\nduring the dry season the plants necessarily would have to be watered\r\nby hand from time to time until they are established.\r\n\r\nPlants for shade.--As a temporary shade and cover crop of rapid growth\r\nwhile the coffee trees are small, perhaps no plant can compete with\r\nthe cadios (Cajanus indicus). The plants may be cut down to serve as\r\nmulch whenever they grow too high, and may be expected to grow from\r\nthe stubble twice before the plants die, provided they are not cut\r\noff too close to the ground.\r\n\r\nIn Java, where robusta coffee is more extensively planted than anywhere\r\nelse, permanent shade is considered advisable. Malaganit (Leucaena\r\nglauca), a leguminous shrub which grows everywhere in the Philippines,\r\nseems to be preferred there to other plants for shade. It is planted\r\nalternately with the coffee plants and, as is the case with all plants\r\nutilized for shade, thinned out later according to need. Madre de cacao\r\n(Gliricidia maculata) and dapdap (Erythrina indica and E. subumbrans)\r\nare other leguminous trees readily obtainable in most localities and\r\nare adapted for shade.\r\n\r\nMadre de cacao should be planted at the same distance as the\r\nmalaganit while the dapdap should be planted one plant to every two\r\ncoffee trees. All these plants are readily propagated by cutting\r\noff limbs or branches 1 to 1.2 meters long and inserting them 20 to\r\n30 centimeters deep in the ground during the rainy season. (This is\r\nmost conveniently done by the aid of a crowbar.) In a limited way\r\nfruit trees, such as the soursop, custardapple, breadfruit, and jak\r\nmay also be used as shade, and these should be planted from 6 to 12\r\nmeters apart according to size. The necessary shading between these\r\ntrees while they are small may be provided by planting malaganit, etc.\r\n\r\nRobusta coffee has also been successfully interplanted with\r\ncoconuts. In this case the palms and coffee should of course be\r\nplanted at the same time, the palms perhaps not closer than 9 to\r\n10 meters apart, the coffee to be used as a \"filler\" between the\r\ncoconuts. In this connection it is perhaps well to state that in\r\nJava robusta coffee is very frequently planted as a \"catch crop\"\r\nin the Hevea rubber plantations. Among the shade plants available to\r\nthe Philippine planter, malaganit, dapdap, and \"guango,\" or raintree\r\n(Pithecolobium saman), have given the best results in Java for the\r\nrobusta with the following ratio yield of coffee: 4.75, 4.10, and 3.06.\r\n\r\nCultivation.--On level and well-cleared land, close attention should\r\nbe paid to keeping the coffee plantation free from weeds during\r\nthe first year or two by means of animal-drawn shallow cultivators,\r\nsupplemented with hand-hoeing. Where the topography of the land or\r\nthe presence of stumps renders this impossible the weeding must of\r\ncourse be done by hand. All weeds should be left in the field where\r\nthey serve both as a mulch in preserving the moisture and to enrich\r\nthe soil. As soon as the plants begin to shade the land they thereby\r\naid in the weed eradication, and weeding then becomes less expensive.\r\n\r\nPruning.--If the trees are allowed to grow without pruning they become\r\ntoo tall (robusta coffee attains a height of 6 meters or more), and\r\nthe topmost berries are then difficult to pick. Furthermore unpruned\r\ncoffee trees (including robusta), have the peculiar habit of bearing\r\ntheir branches near the ground and at the top, leaving the middle bare\r\nor nearly so which decreases the producing capacity of the plant. On\r\nthis account up-to-date planters have generally adopted a system of\r\npruning by which the coffee trees are headed low, giving a maximum\r\nyield coupled with easy access to the berries.\r\n\r\nThe pruning consists of topping the robusta trees when they are from\r\n2 to 2.5 meters tall and of subsequent pruning to keep the trees at\r\nthis height. This work should preferably be done while the plants\r\nare of the proper height and the green shoots easily broken off,\r\nand not after the trees have exceeded the height limit by several\r\ndecimeters. The plant, if allowed to do so, usually sends up a large\r\nnumber of suckers from the base, which constitute a drain on the\r\nvitality of the plant. Therefore, all superfluous suckers should be\r\nremoved and not more than 2 to 3 stems to a plant should be permitted\r\nto develop.\r\n\r\nOccasionally robusta plants appear that are more than ordinarily\r\nsubject to blight, and these should be at once pulled up and burned.\r\n\r\nYield.--The yield of robusta coffee is quite variable, much depending\r\nupon the fertility of the soil. On the more fertile soils in Java the\r\nyield per hectare in the third year was approximately 540 kilograms,\r\nand in the fourth and fifth years, 1,400 and 1,830 kilograms,\r\nrespectively. In old coffee or cacao fields the yields were 325,\r\n540 and 850 kilograms per hectare, respectively, during the third,\r\nfourth, and fifth years after planting. It is perhaps well to recall\r\nthe fact that the average yield of Arabian coffee in the Philippines\r\nis 174 kilograms per hectare, which is of course much less than it\r\nshould be, and it is not believed that the Philippine planter with\r\nhis present methods of cultivation could equal with robusta coffee\r\nthe yields quoted from Java.\r\n\r\nThe immense superiority of the robusta as a cropper over the ordinary\r\nArabian coffee is best illustrated in a table published by the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, Java. We learn here that in Java, under\r\nidentical conditions, the yield per plant was of Arabian coffee, 53\r\nto 97 grams; of robusta, 992 grams; and of quilloi (a new very rare\r\ncoffee) 1,020 grams. The Maragogipe hybrid on its own roots yielded\r\n14 to 18 grams, while grafted on robusta the yield was 156 grams, a\r\nlarger crop than any Arabian coffee has given in Java. This would tend\r\nto show the possibilities of robusta as a stock. Further, comparative\r\nstudies by Cramer have shown that 4 to 5 kilograms of fresh robusta\r\nberries make 1 kilogram of coffee while of the Arabian coffee 5 to\r\n6 kilograms of fruit are required to make 1 kilogram of coffee.\r\n\r\nOwing to the fact that the pulp on the robusta coffee (though smaller\r\nin amount) is more difficult to remove than that on the Arabian,\r\nrobusta needs at least two and one-half days of fermentation. The\r\nbean requires rapid drying in order to loosen the silver skin and\r\nthe drying is therefore done in an artificially heated shed.\r\n\r\nQuality and marketability.--Relative to the quality of the robusta\r\ncoffee Doctor Hall says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The appearance of the average marketable robusta is not very\r\n    beautiful; the beans are small and irregular, and the average\r\n    product shows little uniformity. There are, however, great\r\n    differences between the many different types of robusta. Some of\r\n    them have comparatively large beans, larger even than arabica,\r\n    others again have very small ones. As regards the quality, though\r\n    being inferior to Java-arabica, the taste is generally considered\r\n    to be good and superior to the ordinary arabica sorts, as Santos.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoctor Wildeman states:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is objected that the berries of the robusta group and of\r\n    other African coffees are small in size and inferior in flavor;\r\n    but the continually increasing quantities of these coffees sold\r\n    in Holland, and the satisfactory prices they fetch show that the\r\n    public is beginning to appreciate them. No objections will be made\r\n    to the size of the berries when by means of careful cultivation\r\n    and especially of right preparation, a coffee is obtained equal\r\n    in flavor to the (old) Java and Arabian coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary.\r\n\r\nArabian coffee cannot be successfully grown in the Philippines below\r\nan altitude of 800 meters, and even at this elevation, due to its\r\nsusceptibility to the coffee blight, extensive planting of Arabian\r\ncoffee cannot be recommended.\r\n\r\nSuccess with Arabian coffee is obtainable only by keeping the\r\nplantations clean of weeds and the plants in the best possible\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nFor the rehabilitation of the Philippine coffee industry robusta\r\ncoffee appears more promising at present than any other kind.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of robusta coffee are that it thrives under more\r\nvaried conditions than Arabian coffee, that it is an earlier and a\r\nmore prolific bearer and that it is resistant to the blight.\r\n\r\nBlight resistance in robusta coffee does not mean that it is immune,\r\nbut that notwithstanding the presence of the blight it grows well\r\nand produces abundant crops.\r\n\r\nRobusta coffee is by some authorities regarded as inferior in quality\r\nto Arabian coffee. Nevertheless, considering the optimism with which\r\nrobusta coffee is regarded by conservative European experts in tropical\r\ncrops, coupled with the results obtained in Java, it is confidently\r\nbelieved that robusta coffee is worthy of extended planting in the\r\nPhilippines.\r\n\r\nFrom the Dutch department of agriculture in Java the Bureau of\r\nAgriculture has imported seed of the best robusta coffee available\r\nfor distribution, as well as a considerable quantity of seed of\r\nthe ordinary robusta cultivated in that island. All readers who\r\nare interested in planting robusta coffee are cordially invited to\r\ncommunicate with the Bureau of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANE-JUICE CLARIFICATION.\r\n\r\nBy Cleve. W. Hines, M. S., Station Superintendent.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe clarification of the juice forms one of the most important\r\noperations in sugar manufacture, since the higher the purity of the\r\njuice to be concentrated, the greater the percentage of sucrose that\r\nwill crystallize, and the easier it will be to make a marketable\r\nsugar. If a high-grade sugar, or even yellow clarified sugar is to\r\nbe made, this work should receive still greater attention.\r\n\r\nBefore considering the methods to pursue and the reagents to use,\r\nit is well to decide first upon the grade of sugar it is desirable to\r\nmake. If ordinary centrifugal sugar testing 96 deg. is desired, it will\r\nusually be practical to use only lime in the clarification, since in\r\nthese Islands cane reaches full maturity, and consequently the purity\r\nof the normal juice will be quite high, sometimes as high as 90 deg.\r\nor 92 deg. (apparent purity). If, however, it is desired to make a white\r\nplantation sugar, or granulated sugar, it will be advisable to subject\r\nthe juice to an acidifying or bleaching treatment, as well as to the\r\nlime treatment. Usually sulphurous acid is used for this purpose,\r\nbut sometimes phosphoric acid, or a form of it, is employed. It\r\nis generally best to administer the acidifying agent before the\r\napplication of the lime, since this raises the acidity and permits a\r\nlarger amount of the lime to be used. However, this process is reversed\r\nby some manufacturers, and very good results are often reported.\r\n\r\nIn the acidifying of any cane juice, care must be exercised that too\r\nhigh an acidity is not reached, since acids have an inverting effect\r\nupon sucrose, thus causing a noticeable loss. This of course depends\r\nupon the degree of acidity carried, the temperature maintained,\r\nand the methods followed during the time the juice remains acid.\r\n\r\nWhen it is desired to make a high-grade crystal for granulated sugar,\r\nthe clarification must be more complete, and a water-white thick liquor\r\nshould result, without subsequent treatment by bleaching agents and\r\nother chemicals, except the neutralizing of the slightly yellowish\r\ntint, which will be mentioned later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReagents Used in Clarification.\r\n\r\nThere is a great variety of reagents at the command of the sugar\r\nmanufacturer, each of which has certain merits over others, and all\r\nare valuable in their place when properly used. It will therefore\r\nbe the duty of the operator to select those which best meet his\r\nindividual conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is the purpose of this article to give a brief survey of the\r\nmore common reagents which, under certain conditions, may be used to\r\nadvantage in these Islands.\r\n\r\nLime.--This is perhaps one of the most common and most widely used\r\nof all the reagents. Since the object in view is to increase the\r\npurity of the juice, it is obvious that the purest rock obtainable\r\nshould be used in the preparation of the lime. Another reason why\r\na good lime should be employed, is that one of the main impurities\r\nof the lime rock is magnesium, which, when mixed with cane juice,\r\nbecomes very troublesome in the incrusting of the evaporator tubes,\r\nthus greatly lowering the coefficient of heat transmission.\r\n\r\nMuch of the lime on the market in the Philippines has been made\r\nwithout any attempt to select pure clean limestone or shells. This is\r\nnot suitable for putting into cane juice, and will result in a great\r\ndeal of trouble whenever used in modern evaporating plants. There is,\r\nhowever, an abundant supply of limestone found in various parts of the\r\nPhilippines, which analyses show to be almost free from impurities, and\r\nwhich will make a most excellent lime for clarifying purposes if burned\r\nproperly. At present there is no modern plant for burning this rock\r\non a large scale and consequently much of the work is done in a very\r\ncrude and unsatisfactory manner. Most of the lime for clarification,\r\nin modern sugar factories, is imported, and constitutes a very heavy\r\nexpense. If a lime kiln were installed in conjunction with some of\r\nour sugar factories, fresh and well-burned lime might be made as\r\nneeded. The carbon dioxide could be used in the juice clarification,\r\nas is done in Java, and thus a good grade of plantation sugar could\r\neasily be manufactured. Any excess of burned lime might very readily be\r\nsold to other factories, which now use only high-priced imported lime.\r\n\r\nThe lime used should be of the unslaked type, and should be protected\r\nfrom the air until a short time before using. The process of preparing\r\nthis consists of heating lime rock to a very high temperature, in\r\na kiln for that purpose, whereby the limestone is broken into two\r\ncomponent parts, expressed by the following chemical equation: CaCO3\r\n(limestone) heated to high temperature-->CaO (calcium oxide) + CO2\r\n(carbon dioxide). This calcium oxide, commonly known as \"quick lime,\"\r\nis the substance desired in clarification. It should be slaked by\r\nbeing placed in water just before it is desired for use. This milk\r\nof lime should not be used until after the high temperature caused\r\nby the violent chemical action has subsided. On account of the heat\r\ninvolved and the high alkalinity in local portions, it is never safe to\r\napply crude lime to the juice without previously slaking it in water,\r\nnor is it advisable to use a quantity of juice to mix this lime, as\r\nis quite often practiced in these Islands, since in this case there\r\nmay be a loss of sucrose, with a resulting dark-colored product,\r\nwhich will impair the color of the clarified juice. The following\r\nchemical equation will express the reaction when this lime is slaked:\r\nCaO (calcium oxide) + H2O (water)-->Ca(OH)2 (calcium hydroxide).\r\n\r\nThis calcium hydroxide is a substance which is very caustic, and\r\ncare must be exercised in handling it. Like all bases, it has a\r\ngreat affinity for acid, and consequently its first action is to\r\nneutralize part of the acids present. It then coagulates albumins\r\nand albuminoids, which form a part of the impurities, and throws\r\ndown insoluble salts of sulphates, carbonates and phosphates, and of\r\nthe bases iron and aluminum. These act as mechanical precipitants,\r\nassisting in bringing down other impurities. The compounds of calcium\r\nare practically insoluble in cold cane juices, and may be readily\r\nfiltered, or settled, and the supernatant liquor drawn off. In the\r\naddition of lime, as well as in the application of other reagents,\r\nmuch care must be observed that the proper amount is added. If too\r\nlittle is used, there will be poor clarification and settling of the\r\nprecipitate, while if too much is used, so that alkalinity is reached,\r\nand the juice heated to a high temperature, there will be a darkening\r\nof the juice caused by the decomposition of the reducing sugars by the\r\ncalcium, and the formation of dark-colored compounds, which are very\r\nhard to remove. If the juice is limed to three-tenths or four-tenths\r\ncubic centimeter acidity against N/10 NaOH, using phenolphthalein as\r\nan indicator, there will be little or no chance of trouble. With the\r\nabove dangers in view, it is not safe to employ the haphazard methods\r\nof liming usually practiced here, but the milk of lime should always\r\nbe made of stated density and a measured or weighed amount should be\r\nsupplied to each clarifier of juice, corresponding to prevailing\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nSulphur dioxide.--Where a better grade of sugar than 96 deg. test\r\nis desired, it is often advisable to subject the juice to further\r\ntreatment, one reason for which is to increase the acidity so that a\r\nlarger amount of lime may be added to effect the clarification. In\r\naddition to this the sulphur acts to some extent directly as a\r\nclarifying agent, by precipitating some of the impurities. It also\r\nacts as a bleaching agent by extracting the oxygen from the impurities\r\nand lastly it acts as a disinfectant. It is formed by burning crude\r\nsulphur in a stove made for that purpose. S (sulphur) + O (oxygen\r\nheat)-->SO2 (sulphur dioxide).\r\n\r\nSometimes bombs filled with liquid sulphur dioxide are purchased\r\nfor this purpose. These are inconvenient to use, and this method is\r\nordinarily more expensive than the usual one of burning the sulphur\r\nand producing the gas directly at the factory.\r\n\r\nSulphur dioxide is a heavy gas which is very readily absorbed in water,\r\nand at a temperature of zero C. nearly 80 per cent by volume of the\r\ngas will be taken up.\r\n\r\nAt 40 deg. C. only about 18 per cent by volume of the gas will be\r\nabsorbed. It may readily be seen that the percentage of gas contained\r\nin the juice when saturated will be determined by the temperature.\r\n\r\nThe following equation expresses the absorption of sulphur dioxide\r\nin water at ordinary temperature:\r\n\r\nSO2 (sulphur dioxide) + H2O (water at low temperature)-->H2SO3\r\n(sulphurous acid).\r\n\r\nAnother thing of very great importance is the cooling of the gases\r\nto condense any water that may be present so that no hot gas will\r\nreach the juice to be treated or combine with water in the pipes. The\r\nequation represented when high temperatures are used is as follows:\r\n\r\nSO2 (sulphur dioxide) + H2O (water) + O (high temperature)-->H2SO4\r\n(sulphuric acid).\r\n\r\nThis last-named acid is very corrosive and a powerful investing\r\nagent. It therefore has the property of rapidly destroying sucrose,\r\nespecially at a high temperature.\r\n\r\nIn the burning of sulphur it is well that as thorough a combination\r\nas possible be obtained, else there will be a loss of sulphur,\r\nwhich will deposit in the tubes and choke them, and more time will\r\nbe required for the process. The fumes from a well-regulated sulphur\r\nfurnace should contain from 15 to 16 per cent sulphurous acid. The\r\ntheoretical percentage obtainable is about 21 per cent of the acid.\r\n\r\nCarbon dioxide.--In recent years carbon dioxide gas has found a very\r\nuseful application in the cane-sugar factories, where a good grade\r\nof plantation sugar is desired.\r\n\r\nJava factories have been the foremost in elaborating a system, through\r\ntheir eminent technologists, so that today one may find the bulk of\r\nthe sugars they turn out from certain factories of a very satisfactory\r\ngrade and color. The method they use requires a great deal of skill\r\nand attention in order to yield results that are satisfactory. It is\r\npatterned after the process used in beet-sugar factories, with some\r\ndistinct modifications, which make it applicable to a juice containing\r\nglucose, as is always the case with cane juices.\r\n\r\nThe object of applying any clarifying material is to effect a rise in\r\npurity, and it is especially desirable to remove, in all cases, the\r\nsubstance added, since this itself would tend to act as an impurity\r\nand thus give a lower coefficient, if not properly removed. The\r\nlime, which has been added previously, may be partly removed, as\r\nthe original precipitate formed, and any free lime or compound which\r\nmay be easily decomposed will combine with carbon dioxide, forming\r\ncalcium carbonate or limestone, which is quite insoluble and may be\r\nvery easily filtered off.\r\n\r\nCa(OH)2 (calcium hydroxide) + CO2-->CaCO3 (calcium carbonate) + H2O\r\n(water).\r\n\r\nWhether single or double carbonation is used, the same general methods\r\nare employed, and results are expressed by the same chemical equation.\r\n\r\nAs stated before, the carbon dioxide may be recovered from the kilns\r\nduring the burning of lime, as is commonly done in the beet-sugar\r\nindustry, or it may be purchased in the form of liquid CO2 contained\r\nin heavy iron containers. It is also feasible to use flue gases for\r\nthis purpose, where a good combustion is obtained, and after they\r\nhave been properly treated.\r\n\r\nPhosphoric acid.--It is sometimes advisable to apply a form of\r\nphosphoric acid as a clarifying and precipitating agent after the\r\nlime. This may be used in various forms depending upon the individual\r\ndesires of the operator.\r\n\r\nThe compound usually found on the market may consist of one of the\r\nfollowing (or a combination of them):\r\n\r\n\r\n    H3PO4 (ortho phosphoric acid).\r\n    CaH4(PO4)2 (mono-calcium phosphate).\r\n    Ca2H2(PO4)2 (dicalcium phosphate).\r\n    Na2HPO4 (sodium phosphate).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sodium phosphate contains very little acidity, and the main\r\npurpose of its use is based on the principle that the sodium is\r\nreadily given up for any soluble calcium that may be present. This\r\nforms the insoluble calcium phosphate, which is easily removed as\r\na precipitate or filtered off. The \"Reserve Factory\" in Louisiana\r\nhas been using this reagent in their clarification for a long time,\r\nwhere a very good grade of granulated sugar is made.\r\n\r\nBesides these forms of phosphorous, various compounds may be found\r\non the market, under trade names, which have as their base the above\r\nacid. \"Clariphos\" is one of these compounds, which has found extensive\r\nuse in many of the Louisiana sugar factories.\r\n\r\nAnother is known as \"phospho-gelose,\" which is a combination\r\nof dicalcium phosphate Ca2H2(PO4)2 and infusorial silica. It is a\r\npatented preparation and is made by the absorption of phosphoric acid\r\nby a powdery compound known as \"Kieselguhr.\" After the absorption,\r\nthe compound is heated to expel the water, and then resaturated. This\r\nwork is repeated several times until the finished product, which is\r\nvery hydroscopic, contains about 25 per cent of phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nKieselguhr.--This is a fine light powder containing a high percentage\r\nof silica. It is used purely for its mechanical effect in forming\r\nparticles upon which the impurities may collect, and thus be more\r\nreadily carried to the bottom. This material often prolongs the\r\nworkings of the filter presses by collecting the gummy material,\r\nwhich would otherwise gather on the filter cloths. Kieselguhr was\r\nused in the beet-sugar industry of Europe many years ago, and is\r\nextensively used now for the same purpose in the United States.\r\n\r\nHydrosulphites.--These are preparations of great bleaching power,\r\nfound on the market under various trade names. One of these, widely\r\nused in the United States, in both the beet and cane-sugar industries,\r\nis known as \"Blankit.\" This is dehydrated sodium hydrosulphite with\r\nthe chemical formula, Na2S2O4. It has a much greater bleaching and\r\nreducing action than sulphurous acid, and oxydizes very readily in\r\ncombination with moisture, forming sulphate. On this account it is\r\nwell to purchase the reagent in small parcels for this climate, and\r\nto carefully guard the stored material from moisture. This substance,\r\nwhich is a white powder, dissolves very easily in water, forming an\r\nalkaline liquid, although this point is sometimes hard to distinguish\r\non account of hydrogen atoms liberated.\r\n\r\nThere is a bleaching preparation made in France known as \"Redo,\"\r\nwhich is simply calcium hydrosulphite (CaS2O4). This is used in the\r\nsugar industry to some extent, but it is claimed by many that the\r\nresults obtained are not as good as those obtained from the sodium\r\ncompound and that it deteriorates more easily.\r\n\r\nHydrosulphites, unlike sulphurous acid, will bleach equally as well in\r\nalkaline or neutral medium, as in an acid medium. There is therefore\r\nless danger from loss of sugar by inversion when they are used, while\r\nthe permanency of their effect is about the same. In any case where\r\njuices have been bleached by sulphites, the result may be considered\r\nas but temporary, since upon exposure to air and light the product\r\nassumes a darker color. Hydrosulphites should therefore be introduced\r\nas late in the process as possible. Where the material in the vacuum\r\npan is to be bleached, it is well to introduce this reagent just\r\nbefore striking grain, thus furnishing a bright clear material which\r\nwill act as film over the nucleous of sucrose in the grain.\r\n\r\nThe chemical equation representing the change which takes place with\r\nthis reagent is as follows:\r\n\r\nNa2S2O4 (sodium hydrosulphite) + O (oxygen) + H2O (water)-->2(Na H\r\nS O3).\r\n\r\nThe amount to be used will depend absolutely upon individual\r\nconditions, which may be ascertained only by experimentation. The\r\nmanufacturers of this product state that the amount of the material\r\nused to that of dry sugar should be as 1 is to 10,000. In the writer's\r\nexperience, two or even three times this amount will usually be\r\nrequired to give maximum results. As stated before, since there is\r\nsuch a variance in the material to be treated, each operator will\r\nbe required to judge this to a great extent from the condition of\r\nhis product.\r\n\r\nIn these Islands where a very low grade of open-kettle sugar is still\r\nmade, which sells very cheaply, attempts are often made to bleach\r\nit and recrystalize in order to make a centrifugal sugar.\r\n\r\nWhile ordinary clarifying agents help to a great extent, if the melted\r\nsugars are very dark from caramel and the decomposition products\r\nof calcium glucosate, these reagents can not be expected to give a\r\nlight-colored juice. While they may improve conditions somewhat, the\r\nonly solution to such a problem is the use of the boneblack process.\r\n\r\nBluing.--In the production of plantation clarified sugars, and\r\nsometimes of refinery crystals made from low-grade sugars, there is\r\na thin film surrounding each sugar crystal, which has a yellowish\r\ntint. It is this that gives rise to the different grades of white\r\nsugars, when color test only is considered. Since this yellowish\r\ntinge will give way to a lighter color when neutralized with the\r\nproper shade of blue, it is a very common practice to use some form\r\nof bluing--usually that known as ultramarine--for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe action of this reagent is only mechanical and great care must be\r\nexercised that the proper quantity is used. This must be determined\r\nby trials with the different amounts of the reagent, since the density\r\nof the yellowish tint is different in each case.\r\n\r\nThe place of application will also depend very much upon\r\nconditions. Some operators apply it only at the centrifugals and\r\nothers apply it in the pan just at the graining point. Again others\r\nuse a quantity at both the pan and in the last charge of water at the\r\ncentrifugals. In any case, a good grade only of the reagent should be\r\nused. This must be thoroughly dissolved in clear water, condensed steam\r\nbeing preferred, and passed through cloth or felt filters in order to\r\nremove any trace of lumps which would tend to produce uneven bluing,\r\nor bluish streaks.\r\n\r\nWhile this is an excellent reagent in its place, it must not be\r\nexpected to whiten molasses sugars as was attempted by a local\r\nmanufacturer.\r\n\r\nAnimal charcoal or boneblack.--This material is made from bones of\r\nanimals, by burning them in a kiln built for that purpose. The object\r\nof this burning is to remove the organic matter and leave the remainder\r\nin a porous condition, so that it may be crushed into particles the\r\nproper size. It is not desirable to have a great amount of char dust\r\npresent, since this retards the passage of the liquors through the\r\nfilters, as well as impairing the efficiency of the work.\r\n\r\nBone char, being very porous, absorbs a great volume of gases, among\r\nwhich is oxygen, and it is ordinarily presumed that its bleaching\r\npower may be attributed to this fact. Extensive experiments have\r\nbeen made to determine definitely this point, and the char has been\r\nsubjected to an atmosphere of other gases than oxygen. This proved\r\nthat the char still contained great clarifying power.\r\n\r\nChar also has a great surface attraction, which causes it to collect\r\nparticles of coloring matter that may be present, and thus acts as an\r\nexcellent filtering agent. New char should be thoroughly washed with\r\npure water until all the impurities are removed. With the end in view\r\nof determining when the last traces of chlorine have disappeared,\r\nchemical tests are made on the wash waters. Nitric acid and silver\r\nnitrate are employed for this purpose. After animal char has been used\r\nfor some time in the filters and fails to do its work efficiently,\r\nit is reburned, or revived, as it is called. Ordinarily the best\r\nresults are obtained after a char has been used several times.\r\n\r\nReburning of the char at too high a temperature should be avoided,\r\nas it incurs an unnecessary loss of fuel, besides causing serious\r\ninjury to the char by a contraction of the pores. Since, as stated\r\npreviously, the main value of the char as a clarifying and filtering\r\nmedium lies in the fact of its porosity, anything which reduces this\r\nwill greatly impair its efficiency. One thing in connection with the\r\nbone-char process of making white sugars is that it is expensive and\r\nshould not be attempted except on a large scale, since the initial\r\nexpense of installation, as well as the cost of running, is very\r\ngreat. The writer is sometimes asked by managers of small factories,\r\nturning out plantation yellow clarified sugars, if it would not\r\npay them to employ bone-char filters to use in connection with the\r\nremainder of their factory, in order to be able to work up an industry\r\nwith the low-grade open-kettle sugars, during the intercampaign. Most\r\nassuredly such a combination of small plantation factory and refinery\r\nwould not be a paying affair. It takes men of experience and special\r\ntraining to carry out successfully the more detailed work in any\r\ntechnical line. One thing, however, can be very successfully done by\r\nthese factories, and that is to make a first-class plantation white\r\nsugar which will command a ready price in the local markets, or even\r\nsuffice for export, if the proper manufacturing methods are used.\r\n\r\nIt is not presumed that any one planter will use all of the clarifying\r\nreagents mentioned above, but he should choose the ones to fit his\r\nindividual needs, and secure his supply early, since a great deal of\r\ntime is required to transport supplies from the place of manufacture\r\nto these Islands. This is especially the case when the place of\r\nmanufacture happens to be in Europe, as is true with a number of the\r\npatented clarifying reagents.\r\n\r\nThen, again, a suitable place should be selected for the storage of\r\nreagents, where they may be protected from dampness. The quick-lime\r\nand sulphites are especially susceptible to moisture, while the\r\ngreatest danger of loss, when phosphoric acid compounds are stored,\r\nwill result from leakage. This is on account of the great oxydizing\r\neffect of the acid on the iron loops surrounding the barrels, whereby\r\na great quantity may be lost within a very short time. The writer\r\nobserved this needless waste in one of the small factories here,\r\nwhen twenty barrels of a high-priced acid were stored on the damp\r\nground of the factory, and a great percentage of it wasted.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of clarifying agents offered on the market under\r\nfancy names. Planters are advised to be cautious about the purchasing\r\nof such supplies until they have been thoroughly tried out and proven a\r\nsuccess. Even then, it is better to experiment only on a small scale\r\nuntil it is known that they will meet their individual needs.\r\n\r\nSome of these are not only deficient in clarifying power, but actually\r\nact as an absolute detriment by introducing impurities which lower\r\nthe value of the juice as well as increasing the subsequent work of\r\nboiling and after working of the sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLA FABRICACION DE AZUCAR BLANCO EN LOS INGENIOS.\r\n\r\nBy W.

WESTER, Horticulturist in Charge of Lamao Experiment\r\nStation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShield Budding the Mango.\r\n\r\nThe one defect in the Pound method of shield budding the mango\r\ndescribed in Bureau of Agriculture Bulletin No. 18, The Mango, consists\r\nof the necessity of placing an apron to protect the long petiole\r\nleft on the bud from the sun and the entrance of water, which work\r\nnecessarily requires more time than if the bud could be wrapped as is\r\nthe case in budding citrus trees. However, a possible use of scarred or\r\nnonpetioled budwood as a means of obviating the need of the apron was\r\nsuggested in the above-mentioned publication. The results obtained\r\nin recent experiments conducted at the Lamao experiment station\r\n(November and December, 1914) have fully come up to the expectations\r\nof this modification, and if the work is carefully performed, the\r\noperator should have no trouble in obtaining 85 per cent of live buds\r\nby proceeding in accordance with the following directions:\r\n\r\n(1) Select budwood that is well matured, from the first, second,\r\nand third flushes from the end of a branch. This budwood is always\r\ngreen and smooth.\r\n\r\n(2) Three weeks or more in advance of the date when the budding is to\r\nbe performed, cut off the leaf blades of the budwood selected. This\r\ncauses the petioles to drop. When the scars left after the petioles\r\nhave fallen are well healed the budwood is in condition for budding.\r\n\r\n(3) The buds should be cut about 4 centimeters long, with an ample\r\nwood shield, and inserted in the stock at a point where the bark is\r\ngreen and smooth like the budwood, not where it is rough and brownish.\r\n\r\n(4) Use waxed tape in tying and cover the entire bud.\r\n\r\n(5) When in the course of two to three weeks a good union has formed,\r\nunwind the wrapping so as to expose the leaf bud from which the growth\r\nis to issue, and cut off the top of the stock 10 to 15 centimeters\r\nabove the bud.\r\n\r\n(6) Every ten days after unwrapping the buds go through the nursery and\r\ncarefully rub off all stock sprouts in order to force the buds to grow.\r\n\r\nAll other precautions that are taken in ordinary shield budding must,\r\nof course, also be attended to in order to insure success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExperiments in Shield Budding.\r\n\r\nAfter repeated attempts the shield-budding experiments at the Lamao\r\nexperiment station with the camia (Averrhoa Bilimbi) and the santol\r\n(Sandoricum koetjape) have been successful, and it has also been found\r\nthat the barobo (Diplodiscus paniculatus), a nut tree indigenous to the\r\nPhilippines (Dillenia indica), and the sea grape (Coccoloba uvifera),\r\nmay be propagated by means of shield budding. Detailed information\r\nrelative to the budding of these plants will be published on the\r\ncompletion of the experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImprovement of Tropical Fruits in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe average fruit is so poor that most foreigners never give any\r\nattention to the santol, and the fruit is a drug even in the native\r\nmarkets and enormous quantities annually rot on the ground. Few are\r\naware that there are mutations among the santol trees the fruit of\r\nwhich in point of flavor vies with the best fruits in the Tropics, and\r\nthat in this respect it is superior even to its celebrated relative,\r\nthe lanzon (Lansium domesticum), the greatest defects being the large\r\nseeds and the adherence of the flesh to the seeds. If the seed in these\r\nsuperior santols were abortive in the same proportion as those in\r\nthe mangosteen, the now despised santol, with its translucent pulp,\r\nseparable from the pericarp as that of the mangosteen, subacid,\r\njuicy and of a vinous, excellent flavor, would rapidly become one\r\nof the most popular fruits in the Tropics. Its thick, tough \"rind\"\r\nshould make the santol at least equal to the mangosteen as a shipper.\r\n\r\nWhat is probably the first horticultural, asexually propagated\r\nvariety of the santol is now being established at the Lamao experiment\r\nstation from buds obtained by Mr. F. Galang, assistant agricultural\r\ninspector, from a tree in Pampanga, the fruit of which is so highly\r\nprized locally that the fruit never retails below the relatively high\r\nprice of 2 centavos apiece even when other santols are so plentiful\r\nas to be literally unsalable.\r\n\r\nMr. B. Malvar, assistant agricultural inspector, has obtained\r\nin Batangas budwood of a sweet-fruited camia which is also being\r\npropagated. This is the first mutation of this kind coming to the\r\nattention of the writer.\r\n\r\nThe collection of Philippine citrus fruits of economic value or\r\nof botanical interest has been in progress since in 1911, but\r\nno systematized selection work in the mandarin district has been\r\nattempted until December, 1914, when Mr. B. Malvar was detailed\r\nto visit the citrus region in Batangas. Mr. Malvar returned with\r\nsample fruits of some twenty odd trees, a number of which were found\r\nto be of very good quality. These are being propagated for future\r\ndistribution. Mr. Malvar also found another \"Tizon\" (Citrus nobilis\r\nvar. papillaris) of excellent flavor and quality which has been added\r\nto the citrus collection at Lamao.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPetioled Vs. Nonpetioled Budwood.\r\n\r\nThe last three years' experiments in shield budding tropical fruits\r\nwhich have been conducted by the writer at the Lamao experiment\r\nstation indicate that for practical purposes in propagation work the\r\ntropical fruits may be divided into two groups: (1) Those species the\r\nbudwood of which may be cut at the time of budding and the petioles\r\ncut off close to the bud--for instance, the citrus fruits, avocado,\r\nguava, and carambola; and (2) those species in which decay enters the\r\nbud from the adhering remnant of the petiole so frequently as to make\r\nimpracticable budding from newly cut budwood from twigs with the leaves\r\nstill adhering, such as the mango, hevi, and cacao. It has been found,\r\nhowever, that this trouble may be easily overcome by the simple method\r\nof cutting off the leaf blade about three weeks in advance of when\r\nthe budding is to be done so as to induce the formation of a leaf\r\nscar. Then when the petioles have dropped and a well-healed scar has\r\nformed, the budwood may be cut and the buds inserted and tied as in\r\nordinary shield budding.\r\n\r\nIn the case of some species, whether or not the bud is of the\r\nsame age as the stock at the point of insertion is of little or no\r\npractical importance, but in other species this condition is one\r\nof the requirements for success. Therefore, two chances of failure\r\nare insured against in experimental work with species that hitherto\r\nhave not been budded--(a) by defoliating the budwood previously to\r\nthe budding operation, and using what may be termed nonpetioled or\r\nscarred budwood; and (b) by inserting the buds at a point in the stock\r\nwhich approximately is of the same age and appearance as the budwood.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES BY CLEVE. W. HINES, M. S., Station Superintendent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA New Sugar Industry.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of a tropical industry in what would be considered a\r\nsemitropical climate was noted in 1914, when the Southwestern Sugar\r\nCompany of Arizona milled their first crop of sugar cane and made it\r\ninto sugar. The factory had been used previously for the manufacture\r\nof beet sugar only. It is a singular coincidence to find a region\r\nwhere both cane and beets will thrive well and where sugar is made\r\nfrom both sources in the same factory, and the sugar world is looking\r\nforward with great interest to the results of this new venture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe World's Sugar Supply.\r\n\r\nThe world's production of sugar amounts to nearly seventeen million\r\ntons, practically one half of which is derived from the beet root,\r\nthe greater percentage of which is produced in Europe. Now that the\r\nravages of war have devastated many of the better beet-sugar regions\r\nof Europe a greater demand will be made on the more fortunate sugar\r\ncountries as soon as the present supply of storage sugar is exhausted\r\nand trade resumes its normal condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress in Sugar Manufacture.\r\n\r\nThe past few years have shown great progress in the method of sugar\r\nmaking. It used to be thought that a high grade of sugar could be\r\nmade only by the use of the bone-black or animal-char process.\r\n\r\nThe beet-sugar producers were the first to diverge from this method and\r\nsucceeded in making a perfectly satisfactory sugar in their factories\r\nin one continuous process by the aid of the carbonitation system.\r\n\r\nLouisiana had been making a fairly good sugar known as yellow clarified\r\nfor a number of years, but the great step in improvements along these\r\nlines was brought about by the acid-thin-juice process of Java. This\r\nwas a combination of the carbonitation and sulphitation processes\r\nwhich gave a satisfactory sugar, though unfortunately the yield of\r\nresulting molasses was also quite high.\r\n\r\nThe latest improvement in this work was the introduction of the\r\n\"Battille Process\" which has certain similarities to the Steffens\r\nprocess of beet-sugar manufacture. This method has given an excellent\r\ngrade of sugar and the maximum rendement since practically all of the\r\nsugar is extracted in crystalized form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLICATIONS OF THE BUREAU OF AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubscription rates for The Philippine Agricultural Review are as\r\nfollows: In the Philippine Islands and the United States P2 ($1 United\r\nStates currency) per year; in foreign countries in the Postal Union\r\nP4 ($2 United States currency) per year.
