The present work, however, is the outcome of the need of a\r\ntext-book of very simple outline, in which causes and their consequences\r\nshould be knit together as closely as possible,--a need long felt by the\r\nauthor in his teaching, and perhaps by other teachers also. The author\r\nhas ventured, therefore, to depart from the common usage which\r\nsubdivides geology into a number of departments,--dynamical, structural,\r\nphysiographic, and historical,--and to treat in immediate connection\r\nwith each geological process the land forms and the rock structures\r\nwhich it has produced.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the facts of geology and the inferences drawn from\r\nthem have been so presented as to afford an efficient discipline in\r\ninductive reasoning. Typical examples have been used to introduce many\r\ntopics, and it has been the author's aim to give due proportion to\r\nboth the wide generalizations of our science and to the concrete facts\r\non which they rest.\r\n\r\nThere have been added a number of practical exercises such as the\r\nauthor has used for several years in the class room. These are not\r\nmade so numerous as to displace the problems which no doubt many\r\nteachers prefer to have their pupils solve impromptu during the\r\nrecitation, but may, it is hoped, suggest their use.\r\n\r\nIn historical geology a broad view is given of the development of the\r\nNorth American continent and the evolution of life upon the planet.\r\nOnly the leading types of plants and animals are mentioned, and\r\nspecial attention is given to those which mark the lines of descent of\r\nforms now living.\r\n\r\nBy omitting much technical detail of a mineralogical and\r\npalæontological nature, and by confining the field of view almost\r\nwholly to our own continent, space has been obtained to give to what\r\nare deemed for beginners the essentials of the science a fuller\r\ntreatment than perhaps is common.\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that field work will be introduced with the commencement\r\nof the study. The common rocks are therefore briefly described in the\r\nopening chapters. The drift also receives early mention, and teachers\r\nin the northern states who begin geology in the fall may prefer to\r\ntake up the chapter on the Pleistocene immediately after the chapter\r\non glaciers.\r\n\r\nSimple diagrams have been used freely, not only because they are often\r\nclearer than any verbal statement, but also because they readily lend\r\nthemselves to reproduction on the blackboard by the pupil. The text\r\nwill suggest others which the pupil may invent. It is hoped that the\r\nphotographic views may also be used for exercises in the class room.\r\n\r\nThe generous aid of many friends is recognized with special pleasure.\r\nTo Professor W. M. Davis of Harvard University there is owing a large\r\nobligation for the broad conceptions and luminous statements of\r\ngeologic facts and principles with which he has enriched the\r\nliterature of our science, and for his stimulating influence in\r\neducation. It is hoped that both in subject-matter and in method the\r\nbook itself makes evident this debt. But besides a general obligation\r\nshared by geologists everywhere, and in varying degrees by perhaps all\r\nauthors of recent American text-books in earth science, there is owing\r\na debt direct and personal. The plan of the book, with its use of\r\nproblems and treatment of land forms and rock structures in immediate\r\nconnection with the processes which produce them, was submitted to\r\nProfessor Davis, and, receiving his approval, was carried into effect,\r\nalthough without the sanction of precedent at the time. Professor\r\nDavis also kindly consented to read the manuscript throughout, and his\r\nmany helpful criticisms and suggestions are acknowledged with sincere\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\nParts of the manuscript have been reviewed by Dr. Samuel Calvin and\r\nDr. Frank M. Wilder of the State University of Iowa; Dr. S. W. Beyer\r\nof the Iowa College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts; Dr. U. S. Grant\r\nof Northwestern University; Professor J. A. Udden of Augustana\r\nCollege, Illinois; Dr. C. H.

The principles of\r\nphysical geology come first; the several chapters are arranged in\r\nwhat is believed to be a natural order, appropriate to the\r\ngreatest part of our country, so that from a simple beginning a\r\nlogical sequence of topics leads through the whole subject. The\r\nhistorical view of the science comes second, with many specific\r\nillustrations of the physical processes previously studied, but\r\nnow set forth as part of the story of the earth, with its many\r\nchanges of aspect and its succession of inhabitants. Special\r\nattention is here given to North America, and care is taken to\r\navoid overloading with details.\r\n\r\nWith respect to method of presentation, it must not be forgotten\r\nthat the text-book is only one factor in good teaching, and that\r\nin geology, as in other sciences, the teacher, the laboratory, and\r\nthe local field are other factors, each of which should play an\r\nappropriate part. The text suggests observational methods, but it\r\ncannot replace observation in field or laboratory; it offers\r\ncertain exercises, but space cannot be taken to make it a\r\nlaboratory manual as well as a book for study; it explains many\r\nproblems, but its statements are necessarily more terse than the\r\nillustrative descriptions that a good and experienced teacher\r\nshould supply. Frequent use is made of induction and inference in\r\norder that the student may come to see how reasonable a science is\r\ngeology, and that he may avoid the too common error of thinking\r\nthat the opinions of \"authorities\" are reached by a private road\r\nthat is closed to him. The further extension of this method of\r\npresentation is urged upon the teacher, so that the young\r\ngeologist may always learn the evidence that leads to a\r\nconclusion, and not only the conclusion itself.\r\n\r\nW.

It learns from\r\ntheir composition and structure how the rocks were made and how they\r\nhave been modified. It ascertains how they have been brought to their\r\npresent places and wrought to their various topographic forms, such as\r\nhills and valleys, plains and mountains. It studies the vestiges which\r\nthe rocks preserve of ancient organisms which once inhabited our\r\nplanet. Geology is the history of the earth and its inhabitants, as\r\nread in the rocks of the earth's crust.\r\n\r\nTo obtain a general idea of the nature and method of our science\r\nbefore beginning its study in detail, we may visit some valley, such\r\nas that illustrated in the frontispiece, on whose sides are rocky\r\nledges. Here the rocks lie in horizontal layers. Although only their\r\nedges are exposed, we may infer that these layers run into the upland\r\non either side and underlie the entire district; they are part of the\r\nfoundation of solid rock which everywhere is found beneath the loose\r\nmaterials of the surface.\r\n\r\nThe ledges of the valley of our illustration are of sandstone. Looking\r\nclosely at the rock we see that it is composed of myriads of grains of\r\nsand cemented together. These grains have been worn and rounded. They\r\nare sorted also, those of each layer being about of a size. By some\r\nmeans they have been brought hither from some more ancient source.\r\nSurely these grains have had a history before they here found a\r\nresting place,--a history which we are to learn to read.\r\n\r\nThe successive layers of the rock suggest that they were built one\r\nafter another from the bottom upward. We may be as sure that each\r\nlayer was formed before those above it as that the bottom courses of\r\nstone in a wall were laid before the courses which rest upon them.\r\n\r\nWe have no reason to believe that the lowest layers which we see here\r\nwere the earliest ever formed. Indeed, some deep boring in the\r\nvicinity may prove that the ledges rest upon other layers of rock\r\nwhich extend downward for many hundreds of feet below the valley\r\nfloor. Nor may we conclude that the highest layers here were the\r\nlatest ever laid; for elsewhere we may find still later layers lying\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nA short search may find in the rock relics of animals, such as the\r\nimprints of shells, which lived when it was deposited; and as these\r\nare of kinds whose nearest living relatives now have their home in the\r\nsea, we infer that it was on the flat sea floor that the sandstone was\r\nlaid. Its present position hundreds of feet above sea level proves\r\nthat it has since emerged to form part of the land; while the flatness\r\nof the beds shows that the movement was so uniform and gentle as not\r\nto break or strongly bend them from their original attitude.\r\n\r\nThe surface of some of these layers is ripple-marked. Hence the sand\r\nmust once have been as loose as that of shallow sea bottoms and sea\r\nbeaches to-day, which is thrown into similar ripples by movements of\r\nthe water. In some way the grains have since become cemented into firm\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nNote that the layers on one side of the valley agree with those on the\r\nother, each matching the one opposite at the same level. Once they\r\nwere continuous across the valley. Where the valley now is was once a\r\ncontinuous upland built of horizontal layers; the layers now show\r\ntheir edges, or _outcrop_, on the valley sides because they have been\r\ncut by the valley trench.\r\n\r\nThe rock of the ledges is crumbling away. At the foot of each step of\r\nrock lie fragments which have fallen. Thus the valley is slowly\r\nwidening. It has been narrower in the past; it will be wider in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThrough the valley runs a stream. The waters of rains which have\r\nfallen on the upper parts of the stream's basin are now on their way\r\nto the river and the sea. Rock fragments and grains of sand creeping\r\ndown the valley slopes come within reach of the stream and are washed\r\nalong by the running water. Here and there they lodge for a time in\r\nbanks of sand and gravel, but sooner or later they are taken up again\r\nand carried on. The grains of sand which were brought from some\r\nancient source to form these rocks are on their way to some new goal.\r\nAs they are washed along the rocky bed of the stream they slowly rasp\r\nand wear it deeper. The valley will be deeper in the future; it has\r\nbeen less deep in the past.\r\n\r\nIn this little valley we see slow changes now in progress. We find\r\nalso in the composition, the structure, and the attitude of the rocks,\r\nand the land forms to which they have been sculptured, the record of a\r\nlong succession of past changes involving the origin of sand grains\r\nand their gathering and deposit upon the bottom of some ancient sea,\r\nthe cementation of their layers into solid rock, the uplift of the\r\nrocks to form a land surface, and, last of all, the carving of a\r\nvalley in the upland.\r\n\r\nEverywhere, in the fields, along the river, among the mountains, by the\r\nseashore, and in the desert, we may discover slow changes now in\r\nprogress and the record of similar changes in the past. Everywhere we\r\nmay catch glimpses of a process of gradual change, which stretches\r\nbackward into the past and forward into the future, by which the forms\r\nand structures of the face of the earth are continually built and\r\ncontinually destroyed. The science which deals with this long process is\r\ngeology. Geology treats of the natural changes now taking place upon the\r\nearth and within it, the agencies which produce them, and the land forms\r\nand rock structures which result. It studies the changes of the present\r\nin order to be able to read the history of the earth's changes in the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nThe various agencies which have fashioned the face of the earth may.\r\nbe divided into two general classes. In Part I we shall consider those\r\nwhich work upon the earth from without, such as the weather, running\r\nwater, glaciers, the wind, and the sea. In Part II we shall treat of\r\nthose agencies whose sources are within the earth, and among whose\r\nmanifestations are volcanoes and earthquakes and the various movements\r\nof the earth's crust. As we study each agency we shall notice not only\r\nhow it does its work, but also the records which it leaves in the rock\r\nstructures and the land forms which it produces. With this preparation\r\nwe shall be able in Part III to read in the records of the rocks the\r\nhistory of our planet and the successive forms of life which have\r\ndwelt upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart I\r\n\r\nEXTERNAL GEOLOGICAL AGENCIES\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE WORK OF THE WEATHER\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our excursion to the valley with sandstone ledges we witnessed a\r\nprocess which is going forward in all lands. Everywhere the rocks are\r\ncrumbling away; their fragments are creeping down hillsides to the\r\nstream ways and are carried by the streams to the sea, where they are\r\nrebuilt into rocky layers. When again the rocks are lifted to form\r\nland the process will begin anew; again they will crumble and creep\r\ndown slopes and be washed by streams to the sea. Let us begin our\r\nstudy of this long cycle of change at the point where rocks\r\ndisintegrate and decay under the action of the weather. In studying\r\nnow a few outcrops and quarries we shall learn a little of some common\r\nrocks and how they weather away.\r\n\r\n=Stratification and jointing.= At the sandstone ledges we saw that the\r\nrock was divided into parallel layers. The thicker layers are known as\r\n_strata_, and the thin leaves into which each stratum may sometimes be\r\nsplit are termed _laminæ_. To a greater or less degree these layers\r\ndiffer from each other in fineness of grain, showing that the material\r\nhas been sorted. The planes which divide them are called _bedding\r\nplanes_.\r\n\r\nBesides the bedding planes there are other division planes, which cut\r\nacross the strata from top to bottom. These are found in all rocks and\r\nare known as _joints_ (Fig. 1). Two sets of joints, running at about\r\nright angles to each other, together with the bedding planes, divide\r\nthe sandstone into quadrangular blocks.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 1. Cliff of Sandstone, Ireland]\r\n\r\n=Sandstone.= Examining a piece of sandstone we find it composed of\r\ngrains quite like those of river sand or of sea beaches. Most of the\r\ngrains are of a clear glassy mineral called quartz. These quartz\r\ngrains are very hard and will scratch the steel of a knife blade. They\r\nare not affected by acid, and their broken surfaces are irregular like\r\nthose of broken glass.\r\n\r\nThe grains of sandstone are held together by some cement. This may be\r\n_calcareous_, consisting of soluble carbonate of lime. In brown\r\nsandstones the cement is commonly _ferruginous_,--hydrated iron oxide,\r\nor iron rust, forming the bond, somewhat as in the case of iron nails\r\nwhich have rusted together. The strongest and most lasting cement is\r\n_siliceous_, and sand rocks whose grains are closely cemented by\r\nsilica, the chemical substance of which quartz is made, are known as\r\nquartzites.\r\n\r\nWe are now prepared to understand how sandstone is affected by the\r\naction of the weather. On ledges where the rock is exposed to view its\r\nsurface is more or less discolored and the grains are loose and may be\r\nrubbed off with the finger. On gentle slopes the rock is covered with\r\na soil composed of sand, which evidently is crumbled sandstone, and\r\ndark carbonaceous matter derived from the decay of vegetation. Clearly\r\nit is by the dissolving of the cement that the rock thus breaks down\r\nto loose sand. A piece of sandstone with calcareous cement, or a bit\r\nof old mortar, which is really an artificial stone also made of sand\r\ncemented by lime, may be treated in a test tube with hydrochloric acid\r\nto illustrate the process.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 2. Section of Limestone Quarry\r\n\r\n   Scale, 1 in. = 30 ft. _a_, red residual clay; _mn_, pitted\r\n   surface of rotted limestone; _bb_, limestone divided into thin\r\n   layers; _c_, thick layers of laminated limestone, the laminæ\r\n   being firmly cemented together; _j_, _j_, _j_, joints. Is _bb_\r\n   thin-layered because originally so laid, or because it has been\r\n   broken up by weathering, although once like _c_ thick-layered?]\r\n\r\nA limestone quarry. Here also we find the rock stratified and jointed\r\n(Fig. 2). On the quarry face the rock is distinctly seen to be altered\r\nfor some distance from its upper surface. Below the altered zone the\r\nrock is sound and is quarried for building; but the altered upper\r\nlayers are too soft and broken to be used for this purpose. If the\r\nlimestone is laminated, the laminae here have split apart, although\r\nbelow they hold fast together. Near the surface the stone has become\r\nrotten and crumbles at the touch, while on the top it has completely\r\nbroken down to a thin layer of limestone meal, on which rests a fine\r\nreddish clay.\r\n\r\nLimestone is made of minute grains of carbonate of lime all firmly\r\nheld together by a calcareous cement. A piece of the stone placed in a\r\ntest tube with hydrochloric acid dissolves with brisk effervescence,\r\nleaving the insoluble impurities, which were disseminated through it,\r\nat the bottom of the tube as a little clay.\r\n\r\nWe can now understand the changes in the upper layers of the quarry.\r\nAt the surface of the rock the limestone has completely dissolved,\r\nleaving the insoluble residue as a layer of reddish clay. Immediately\r\nbelow the clay the rock has disintegrated into meal where the cement\r\nbetween the limestone grains has been removed, while beneath this the\r\nlaminae are split apart where the cement has been dissolved only along\r\nthe planes of lamination where the stone is more porous. As these\r\nchanges in the rock are greatest at the surface and diminish downward,\r\nwe infer that they have been caused by agents working downward from\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nAt certain points these agencies have been more effective than\r\nelsewhere. The upper rock surface is pitted. Joints are widened as\r\nthey approach the surface, and along these seams we may find that the\r\nrock is altered even down to the quarry floor.\r\n\r\n=A shale pit.= Let us now visit some pit where shale--a laminated and\r\nsomewhat hardened clay--is quarried for the manufacture of brick. The\r\nlaminae of this fine-grained rock may be as thin as cardboard in\r\nplaces, and close joints may break the rock into small rhombic blocks.\r\nOn the upper surface we note that the shale has weathered to a clayey\r\nsoil in which all traces of structure have been destroyed. The clay\r\nand the upper layers of the shale beneath it are reddish or yellow,\r\nwhile in many cases the color of the unaltered rock beneath is blue.\r\n\r\n=The sedimentary rocks.= The three kinds of layered rocks whose\r\nacquaintance we have made--sandstone, limestone, and shale--are the\r\nleading types of the great group of stratified, or sedimentary, rocks.\r\nThis group includes all rocks made of sediments, their materials\r\nhaving settled either in water upon the bottoms of rivers, lakes, or\r\nseas, or on dry land, as in the case of deposits made by the wind and\r\nby glaciers. Sedimentary rocks are divided into the fragmental\r\nrocks--which are made of fragments, either coarse or fine--and the far\r\nless common rocks which are constituted of chemical precipitates.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 3. Conglomerate]\r\n\r\nThe sedimentary rocks are divided according to their composition into\r\nthe following classes:\r\n\r\n1. The arenaceous, or quartz rocks, including beds of loose sand and\r\ngravel, sandstone, quartzite, and conglomerate (a rock made of\r\ncemented rounded gravel or pebbles).\r\n\r\n2. The calcareous, or lime rocks, including limestone and a soft white\r\nrock formed of calcareous powder known as chalk.\r\n\r\n3. The argillaceous, or clay rocks, including muds, clays, and shales.\r\nThese three classes pass by mixture into one another. Thus there are\r\nlimy and clayey sandstones, sandy and clayey limestones, and sandy and\r\nlimy shales.\r\n\r\n=Granite.= This familiar rock may be studied as an example of the\r\nsecond great group of rocks,--_the unstratified_, or _igneous rocks_.\r\nThese are not made of cemented sedimentary grains, but of interlocking\r\ncrystals which have crystallized from a molten mass. Examining a piece\r\nof granite, the most conspicuous crystals which meet the eye are those\r\nof feldspar. They are commonly pink, white, or yellow, and break along\r\nsmooth cleavage planes which reflect the light like tiny panes of\r\nglass. Mica may be recognized by its glittering plates, which split\r\ninto thin elastic scales. A third mineral, harder than steel, breaking\r\nalong irregular surfaces like broken glass, we identify as quartz.\r\n\r\nHow granite alters under the action of the weather may be seen in\r\noutcrops where it forms the bed rock, or country rock, underlying the\r\nloose formations of the surface, and in many parts of the northern\r\nstates where granite bowlders and pebbles more or less decayed may be\r\nfound in a surface sheet of stony clay called the drift. Of the\r\ndifferent minerals composing granite, quartz alone remains unaltered.\r\nMica weathers to detached flakes which have lost their elasticity. The\r\nfeldspar crystals have lost their luster and hardness, and even have\r\ndecayed to clay. Where long-weathered granite forms the country rock,\r\nit often may be cut with spade or trowel for several feet from the\r\nsurface, so rotten is the feldspar, and here the rock is seen to break\r\ndown to a clayey soil containing grains of quartz and flakes of mica.\r\n\r\nThese are a few simple illustrations of the surface changes which some\r\nof the common kinds of rocks undergo. The agencies by which these\r\nchanges are brought about we will now take up under two\r\ndivisions,--_chemical agencies_ producing rock decay and _mechanical\r\nagencies_ producing rock disintegration.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chemical Work Of Water\r\n\r\nAs water falls on the earth in rain it has already absorbed from the\r\nair carbon dioxide (carbonic acid gas) and oxygen. As it sinks into\r\nthe ground and becomes what is termed ground water, it takes into\r\nsolution from the soil humus acids and carbon dioxide, both of which\r\nare constantly being generated there by the decay of organic matter.\r\nSo both rain and ground water are charged with active chemical agents,\r\nby the help of which they corrode and rust and decompose all rocks to\r\na greater or less degree. We notice now three of the chief chemical\r\nprocesses concerned in weathering,--solution, the formation of\r\ncarbonates, and oxidation.\r\n\r\n=Solution.= Limestone, although so little affected by pure water that\r\nfive thousand gallons would be needed to dissolve a single pound, is\r\neasily dissolved in water charged with carbon dioxide. In limestone\r\nregions well water is therefore \"hard.\" On boiling the water for some\r\ntime the carbon dioxide gas is expelled, the whole of the lime\r\ncarbonate can no longer be held in solution, and much of it is thrown\r\ndown to form a crust or \"scale\" in the kettle or in the tubes of the\r\nsteam boiler. All waters which flow over limestone rocks or soak\r\nthrough them are constantly engaged in dissolving them away, and in\r\nthe course of time destroy beds of vast extent and great thickness.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 4. Surface of Limestone furrowed by\r\n     Weathering, Montana]\r\n\r\nThe upper surface of limestone rocks becomes deeply pitted, as we saw\r\nin the limestone quarry, and where the mantle of waste has been\r\nremoved it may be found so intricately furrowed that it is difficult\r\nto traverse (Fig. 4).\r\n\r\nBeds of _rock salt_ buried among the strata are dissolved by seeping\r\nwater, which issues in salt springs. _Gypsum_, a mineral composed of\r\nhydrated sulphate of lime, and so soft that it may be scratched with\r\nthe finger nail, is readily taken up by water, giving to the water of\r\nwells and springs a peculiar hardness difficult to remove.\r\n\r\nThe dissolving action of moisture may be noted on marble tombstones of\r\nsome age, marble being a limestone altered by heat and pressure and\r\ncomposed of crystalline grains. By assuming that the date on each\r\nmonument marks the year of its erection, one may estimate how many\r\nyears on the average it has taken for weathering to loosen fine grains\r\non the polished surface, so that they may be rubbed off with the\r\nfinger, to destroy the polish, to round the sharp edges of tool marks\r\nin the lettering, and at last to open cracks and seams and break down\r\nthe stone. We may notice also whether the gravestones weather more\r\nrapidly on the sunny or the shady side, and on the sides or on the\r\ntop.\r\n\r\nThe weathered surface of granular limestone containing shells shows\r\nthem standing in relief. As the shells are made of crystalline\r\ncarbonate of lime, we may infer whether the carbonate of lime is less\r\nsoluble in its granular or in its crystalline condition.\r\n\r\n=The formation of carbonates.= In attacking minerals water does more\r\nthan merely take them into solution. It decomposes them, forming new\r\nchemical compounds of which the carbonates are among the most\r\nimportant. Thus feldspar consists of the insoluble silicate of\r\nalumina, together with certain alkaline silicates which are broken up\r\nby the action of water containing carbon dioxide, forming alkaline\r\ncarbonates. These carbonates are freely soluble and contribute potash\r\nand soda to soils and river waters. By the removal of the soluble\r\ningredients of feldspar there is left the silicate of alumina, united\r\nwith water or hydrated, in the condition of a fine plastic clay which,\r\nwhen white and pure, is known as _kaolin_ and is used in the\r\nmanufacture of porcelain. Feldspathic rocks which contain no iron\r\ncompounds thus weather to whitish crusts, and even apparently sound\r\ncrystals of feldspar, when ground to thin slices and placed under the\r\nmicroscope, may be seen to be milky in color throughout because an\r\ninternal change to kaolin has begun.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 5. Bowlder split by Heat and Cold,\r\n     Western Texas]\r\n\r\n=Oxidation.= Rocks containing compounds of iron weather to reddish\r\ncrusts, and the seams of these rocks are often lined with rusty films.\r\nOxygen and water have here united with the iron, forming hydrated iron\r\noxide. The effects of oxidation may be seen in the alteration of many\r\nkinds of rocks and in red and yellow colors of soils and subsoils.\r\n\r\n_Pyrite_ is a very hard mineral of a pale brass color, found in\r\nscattered crystals in many rocks, and is composed of iron and sulphur\r\n(iron sulphide). Under the attack of the weather it takes up oxygen,\r\nforming iron sulphate (green vitriol), a soluble compound, and\r\ninsoluble hydrated iron oxide, which as a mineral is known as\r\nlimonite. Several large masses of iron sulphide were placed some years\r\nago on the lawn in front of the National Museum at Washington. The\r\nmineral changed so rapidly to green vitriol that enough of this\r\npoisonous compound was washed into the ground to kill the roots of the\r\nsurrounding grass.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgents Of Mechanical Disintegration\r\n\r\n=Heat and cold.= Rocks exposed to the direct rays of the sun become\r\nstrongly heated by day and expand. After sunset they rapidly cool and\r\ncontract. When the difference in temperature between day and night is\r\nconsiderable, the repeated strains of sudden expansion and contraction\r\nat last become greater than the rocks can bear, and they break, for\r\nthe same reason that a glass cracks when plunged into boiling water\r\n(Fig. 5).\r\n\r\nRocks are poor conductors of heat, and hence their surfaces may become\r\npainfully hot under the full blaze of the sun, while the interior\r\nremains comparatively cool. By day the surface shell expands and tends\r\nto break loose from the mass of the stone. In cooling in the evening\r\nthe surface shell suddenly contracts on the unyielding interior and in\r\ntime is forced off in scales (Fig. 6).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 6. Bowlders scaling off under Heat and Cold,\r\n     Western Texas]\r\n\r\nMany rocks, such as granite, are made up of grains of various minerals\r\nwhich differ in color and in their capacity to absorb heat, and which\r\ntherefore contract and expand in different ratios. In heating and\r\ncooling these grains crowd against their neighbors and tear loose from\r\nthem, so that finally the rock disintegrates into sand.\r\n\r\nThe conditions for the destructive action of heat and cold are most\r\nfully met in arid regions when vegetation is wanting for lack of\r\nsufficient rain. The soil not being held together by the roots of\r\nplants is blown away over large areas, leaving the rocks bare to the\r\nblazing sun in a cloudless sky. The air is dry, and the heat received\r\nby the earth by day is therefore rapidly radiated at night into space.\r\nThere is a sharp and sudden fall of temperature after sunset, and the\r\nrocks, strongly heated by day, are now chilled perhaps even to the\r\nfreezing point.\r\n\r\nIn the Sahara the thermometer has been known to fall 131° F. within a\r\nfew hours. In the light air of the Pamir plateau in central Asia a\r\nrise of 90° F. has been recorded from seven o'clock in the morning to\r\none o'clock in the afternoon. On the mountains of southwestern Texas\r\nthere are frequently heard crackling noises as the rocks of that arid\r\nregion throw off scales from a fraction of an inch to four inches in\r\nthickness, and loud reports are made as huge bowlders split apart.\r\nDesert pebbles weakened by long exposure to heat and cold have been\r\nshivered to fine sharp-pointed fragments on being placed in sand\r\nheated to 180 degrees F. Beds half a foot thick, forming the floor of\r\nlimestone quarries in Wisconsin, have been known to buckle and arch\r\nand break to fragments under the heat of the summer sun.\r\n\r\n=Frost.= By this term is meant the freezing and thawing of water\r\ncontained in the pores and crevices of rocks. All rocks are more or\r\nless porous and all contain more or less water in their pores. Workers\r\nin stone call this \"quarry water,\" and speak of a stone as \"green\"\r\nbefore the quarry water has dried out. Water also seeps along joints\r\nand bedding planes and gathers in all seams and crevices. Water\r\nexpands in freezing, ten cubic inches of water freezing to about\r\neleven cubic inches of ice. As water freezes in the rifts and pores of\r\nrocks it expands with the irresistible force illustrated in the\r\nfreezing and breaking of water pipes in winter. The first rift in the\r\nrock, perhaps too narrow to be seen, is widened little by little by\r\nthe wedges of successive frosts, and finally the rock is broken into\r\ndetached blocks, and these into angular chip-stone by the same\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nIt is on mountain tops and in high latitudes that the effects of frost\r\nare most plainly seen. \"Every summit\" says Whymper, \"amongst the rock\r\nsummits upon which I have stood has been nothing but a piled-up heap\r\nof fragments\" (Fig. 7). In Iceland, in Spitzbergen, in Kamchatka, and\r\nin other frigid lands large areas are thickly strewn with sharp-edged\r\nfragments into which the rock has been shattered by frost.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 7. Rocks broken by Frost, Summit of the\r\n     Eggischhorn, Switzerland]\r\n\r\n=Organic agents.= We must reckon the roots of plants and trees among\r\nthe agents which break rocks into pieces. The tiny rootlet in its\r\nsearch for food and moisture inserts itself into some minute rift, and\r\nas it grows slowly wedges the rock apart. Moreover, the acids of the\r\nroot corrode the rocks with which they are in contact. One may\r\nsometimes find in the soil a block of limestone wrapped in a mesh of\r\nroots, each of which lies in a little furrow where it has eaten into\r\nthe stone.\r\n\r\nRootless plants called _lichens_ often cover and corrode rocks as yet\r\nbare of soil; but where lichens are destroying the rock less rapidly\r\nthan does the weather, they serve in a way as a protection.\r\n\r\n=Conditions favoring disintegration and decay.= The disintegration of\r\nrocks under frost and temperature changes goes on most rapidly in cold\r\nand arid climates, and where vegetation is scant or absent. On the\r\ncontrary, the decay of rocks under the chemical action of water is\r\nfavored by a warm, moist climate and abundant vegetation. Frost and\r\nheat and cold can only act within the few feet from the surface to\r\nwhich the necessary temperature changes are limited, while water\r\npenetrates and alters the rocks to great depths.\r\n\r\nThe pupil may explain.\r\n\r\nIn what ways the presence of joints and bedding planes assists in the\r\nbreaking up and decay of rocks under the action of the weather.\r\n\r\nWhy it is a good rule of stone masons never to lay stones on edge, but\r\nalways on their natural bedding planes.\r\n\r\nWhy stones fresh from the quarry sometimes go to pieces in early\r\nwinter, when stones which have been quarried for some months remain\r\nuninjured.\r\n\r\nWhy quarrymen in the northern states often keep their quarry floors\r\nflooded during winter.\r\n\r\nWhy laminated limestone should not be used for curbstone.\r\n\r\nWhy rocks composed of layers differing in fineness of grain and in\r\nratios of expansion do not make good building stone.\r\n\r\nFine-grained rocks with pores so small that capillary attraction keeps\r\nthe water which they contain from readily draining away are more apt\r\nto hold their pores ten elevenths full of water than are rocks whose\r\npores are larger. Which, therefore, are more likely to be injured by\r\nfrost?\r\n\r\nWhich is subject to greater temperature changes, a dark rock or one of\r\na light color? the north side or the south side of a valley?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mantle of Rock Waste\r\n\r\nWe have seen that rocks are everywhere slowly wasting away. They are\r\nbroken in pieces by frost, by tree roots, and by heat and cold. They\r\ndissolve and decompose under the chemical action of water and the\r\nvarious corrosive substances which it contains, leaving their\r\ninsoluble residues as residual clays and sands upon the surface. As a\r\nresult there is everywhere forming a mantle of rock waste which covers\r\nthe land. It is well to imagine how the country would appear were this\r\nmantle with its soil and vegetation all scraped away or had it never\r\nbeen formed. The surface of the land would then be everywhere of bare\r\nrock as unbroken as a quarry floor.\r\n\r\n=The thickness of the mantle.= In any locality the thickness of the\r\nmantle of rock waste depends as much on the rate at which it is\r\nconstantly being removed as on the rate at which it is forming. On the\r\nface of cliffs it is absent, for here waste is removed as fast as it\r\nis made. Where waste is carried away more slowly than it is produced,\r\nit accumulates in time to great depth.\r\n\r\nThe granite of Pikes Peak is disintegrated to a depth of twenty feet.\r\nIn the city of Washington granite rock is so softened to a depth of\r\neighty feet that it can be removed with pick and shovel. About\r\nAtlanta, Georgia, the rocks are completely rotted for one hundred feet\r\nfrom the surface, while the beginnings of decay may be noticed at\r\nthrice that depth. In places in southern Brazil the rock is decomposed\r\nto a depth of four hundred feet.\r\n\r\nIn southwestern Wisconsin a reddish residual clay has an average depth\r\nof thirteen feet on broad uplands, where it has been removed to the\r\nleast extent. The country rock on which it rests is a limestone with\r\nabout ten per cent of insoluble impurities. At least how thick, then,\r\nwas that portion of the limestone which has rotted down to the clay?\r\n\r\n=Distinguishing characteristics of residual waste.= We must learn to\r\ndistinguish waste formed in place by the action of the weather from\r\nthe products of other geological agencies. Residual waste is\r\nunstratified. It contains no substances which have not been derived\r\nfrom the weathering of the parent rock. There is a gradual transition\r\nfrom residual waste into the unweathered rock beneath. Waste resting\r\non sound rock evidently has been shifted and was not formed in place.\r\n\r\nIn certain regions of southern Missouri the land is covered with a\r\nlayer of broken flints and red clay, while the country rock is\r\nlimestone. The limestone contains nodules of flint, and we may infer\r\nthat it has been by the decay and removal of thick masses of limestone\r\nthat the residual layer of clay and flints has been left upon the\r\nsurface. Flint is a form of quartz, dull-lustered, usually gray or\r\nblackish in color, and opaque except on thinnest edges, where it is\r\ntranslucent.\r\n\r\nOver much of the northern states there is spread an unstratified stony\r\nclay called the _drift_. It often rests on sound rocks. It contains\r\ngrains of sand, pebbles, and bowlders composed of many different\r\nminerals and rocks that the country rock cannot furnish. Hence the\r\ndrift cannot have been formed by the decay of the rock of the region.\r\nA shale or limestone, for example, cannot waste to a clay containing\r\ngranite pebbles. The origin of the drift will be explained in\r\nsubsequent chapters.\r\n\r\nThe differences in rocks are due more to their soluble than to their\r\ninsoluble constituents. The latter are few in number and are much the\r\nsame in rocks of widely different nature, being chiefly quartz,\r\nsilicate of alumina, and iron oxide. By the removal of their soluble\r\nparts very many and widely different rocks rot down to a residual clay\r\ngritty with particles of quartz and colored red or yellow with iron\r\noxide.\r\n\r\nIn a broad way the changes which rocks undergo in weathering are an\r\nadaptation to the environment in which they find themselves at the\r\nearth's surface,--an environment different from that in which they\r\nwere formed under sea or under ground. In open air, where they are\r\nattacked by various destructive agents, few of the rock-making\r\nminerals are stable compounds except quartz, the iron oxides, and the\r\nsilicate of alumina; and so it is to one or more of these\r\ncomparatively insoluble substances that most rocks are reduced by long\r\ndecay.\r\n\r\nWhich produces a mantle of finer waste, frost or chemical decay? which\r\na thicker mantle? In what respects would you expect that the mantle of\r\nwaste would differ in warm humid lands like India, in frozen countries\r\nlike Alaska, and in deserts such as the Sahara?\r\n\r\n=The soil.= The same agencies which produce the mantle of waste are\r\ncontinually at work upon it, breaking it up into finer and finer\r\nparticles and causing its more complete decay. Thus on the surface,\r\nwhere the waste has weathered longest, it is gradually made fine\r\nenough to support the growth of plants, and is then known as _soil_.\r\nThe coarser waste beneath is sometimes spoken of as subsoil. Soil\r\nusually contains more or less dark, carbonaceous, decaying organic\r\nmatter, called humus, and is then often termed the _humus layer_. Soil\r\nforms not only on waste produced in place from the rock beneath, but\r\nalso on materials which have been transported, such as sheets of\r\nglacial drift and river deposits.\r\n\r\nUntil rocks are reduced to residual clays the work of the weather is\r\nmore rapid and effective on the fragments of the mantle of waste than\r\non the rocks from which waste is being formed. Why?\r\n\r\nAny fresh excavation of cellar or cistern, or cut for road or railway,\r\nwill show the characteristics of the humus layer. It may form only a\r\ngray film on the surface, or we may find it a layer a foot or more\r\nthick, dark, or even black, above, and growing gradually lighter in\r\ncolor as it passes by insensible gradations into the subsoil. In some\r\nway the decaying vegetable matter continually forming on the surface\r\nhas become mingled with the material beneath it.\r\n\r\n=How humus and the subsoil are mingled.= The mingling of humus and the\r\nsubsoil is brought about by several means. The roots of plants\r\npenetrate the waste, and when they die leave their decaying substance\r\nto fertilize it. Leaves and stems falling on the surface are turned\r\nunder by several agents. Earthworms and other animals whose home is in\r\nthe waste drag them into their burrows either for food or to line\r\ntheir nests. Trees overthrown by the wind, roots and all, turn over\r\nthe soil and subsoil and mingle them together. Bacteria also work in\r\nthe waste and contribute to its enrichment. The animals living in the\r\nmantle do much in other ways toward the making of soil. They bring the\r\ncoarser fragments from beneath to the surface, where the waste\r\nweathers more rapidly. Their burrows allow air and water to penetrate\r\nthe waste more freely and to affect it to greater depths.\r\n\r\n=Ants.= In the tropics the mantle of waste is worked over chiefly by\r\nants. They excavate underground galleries and chambers, extending\r\nsometimes as much as fourteen feet below the surface, and build mounds\r\nwhich may reach as high above it. In some parts of Paraguay and\r\nsouthern Brazil these mounds, like gigantic potato hills, cover tracts\r\nof considerable area.\r\n\r\nIn search for its food--the dead wood of trees--the so-called white\r\nant constructs runways of earth about the size of gas pipes, reaching\r\nfrom the base of the tree to the topmost branches. On the plateaus of\r\ncentral Africa explorers have walked for miles through forests every\r\ntree of which was plastered with these galleries of mud. Each grain of\r\nearth used in their construction is moistened and cemented by slime as\r\nit is laid in place by the ant, and is thus acted on by organic\r\nchemical agents. Sooner or later these galleries are beaten down by\r\nheavy rains, and their fertilizing substances are scattered widely by\r\nthe winds.\r\n\r\n=Earthworms.= In temperate regions the waste is worked over largely by\r\nearthworms. In making their burrows worms swallow earth in order to\r\nextract from it any nutritive organic matter which it may contain.\r\nThey treat it with their digestive acids, grind it in their stony\r\ngizzards, and void it in castings on the surface of the ground. It was\r\nestimated by Darwin that in many parts of England each year, on every\r\nacre, more than ten tons of earth pass through the bodies of\r\nearthworms and are brought to the surface, and that every few years\r\nthe entire soil layer is thus worked over by them.\r\n\r\nIn all these ways the waste is made fine and stirred and enriched.\r\nGrain by grain the subsoil with its fresh mineral ingredients is\r\nbrought to the surface, and the rich organic matter which plants and\r\nanimals have taken from the atmosphere is plowed under. Thus Nature\r\nplows and harrows on \"the great world's farm\" to make ready and ever\r\nto renew a soil fit for the endless succession of her crops.\r\n\r\nThe world processes by which rocks are continually wasting away are\r\nthus indispensable to the life of plants and animals. The organic\r\nworld is built on the ruins of the inorganic, and because the solid\r\nrocks have been broken down into soil men are able to live upon the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n=Solar energy.= The source of the energy which accomplishes all this\r\nnecessary work is the sun. It is the radiant energy of the sun which\r\ncauses the disintegration of rocks, which lifts vapor into the\r\natmosphere to fall as rain, which gives life to plants and animals.\r\nConsidering the earth in a broad way, we may view it as a globe of\r\nsolid rock,--_the lithosphere_,--surrounded by two mobile envelopes:\r\nthe envelope of air,--_the atmosphere_; and the envelope of\r\nwater,--_the hydrosphere_. Under the action of solar energy these\r\nenvelopes are in constant motion. Water from the hydrosphere is\r\ncontinually rising in vapor into the atmosphere, the air of the\r\natmosphere penetrates the hydrosphere,--for its gases are dissolved in\r\nall waters,--and both air and water enter and work upon the solid\r\nearth. By their action upon the lithosphere they have produced a third\r\nenvelope,--the mantle of rock waste.\r\n\r\nThis envelope also is in movement, not indeed as a whole, but particle\r\nby particle. The causes which set its particles in motion, and the\r\ndifferent forms which the mantle comes to assume, we will now proceed\r\nto study.\r\n\r\n\r\nMovements of the Mantle of Rock Waste\r\n\r\nAt the sandstone ledges which we first visited we saw not only that\r\nthe rocks were crumbling away, but also that grains and fragments of\r\nthem were creeping down the slopes of the valley to the stream and\r\nwere carried by it onward toward the sea. This process is going on\r\neverywhere. Slowly it may be, and with many interruptions, but surely,\r\nthe waste of the land moves downward to the sea. We may divide its\r\ncourse into two parts,--the path to the stream, which we will now\r\nconsider, and its carriage onward by the stream, which we will defer\r\nto a later chapter.\r\n\r\n=Gravity.= The chief agent concerned in the movement of waste is\r\ngravity. Each particle of waste feels the unceasing downward pull of\r\nthe earth's mass and follows it when free to do so. All agencies which\r\nproduce waste tend to set its particles free and in motion, and\r\ntherefore coöperate with gravity. On cliffs, rocks fall when wedged\r\noff by frost or by roots of trees, and when detached by any other\r\nagency. On slopes of waste, water freezes in chinks between stones,\r\nand in pores between particles of soil, and wedges them apart. Animals\r\nand plants stir the waste, heat expands it, cold contracts it, the\r\nstrokes of the raindrops drive loose particles down the slope and the\r\nwind lifts and lets them fall. Of all these movements, gravity assists\r\nthose which are downhill and retards those which are uphill. On the\r\nwhole, therefore, the downhill movements prevail, and the mantle of\r\nwaste, block by block and grain by grain, creeps along the downhill\r\npath.\r\n\r\nA slab of sandstone laid on another of the same kind at an angle of\r\n17° and left in the open air was found to creep down the slope at the\r\nrate of a little more than a millimeter a month. Explain why it did\r\nso.\r\n\r\n=Rain.= The most efficient agent in the carriage of waste to the\r\nstreams is the rain. It moves particles of soil by the force of the\r\nblows of the falling drops, and washes them down all slopes to within\r\nreach of permanent streams. On surfaces unprotected by vegetation, as\r\non plowed fields and in arid regions, the rain wears furrows and\r\ngullies both in the mantle of waste and in exposures of unaltered rock\r\n(Fig. 17).\r\n\r\nAt the foot of a hill we may find that the soil has accumulated by\r\ncreep and wash to the depth of several feet; while where the hillside\r\nis steepest the soil may be exceedingly thin, or quite absent, because\r\nremoved about as fast as formed. Against the walls of an abbey built\r\non a slope in Wales seven hundred years ago, the creeping waste has\r\ngathered on the uphill side to a depth of seven feet. The slow-flowing\r\nsheet of waste is often dammed by fences and walls, whose uphill side\r\ngathers waste in a few years so as to show a distinctly higher surface\r\nthan the downhill side, especially in plowed fields where the movement\r\nis least checked by vegetation.\r\n\r\n=Talus.= At the foot of cliffs there is usually to be found a slope of\r\nrock fragments which clearly have fallen from above (Fig. 8). Such a\r\nheap of waste is known as _talus_. The amount of talus in any place\r\ndepends both on the rate of its formation and the rate of its removal.\r\nTalus forms rapidly in climates where mechanical disintegration is\r\nmost effective, where rocks are readily broken into blocks because\r\nclosely jointed and thinly bedded rather than massive, and where they\r\nare firm enough to be detached in fragments of some size instead of in\r\nfine grains. Talus is removed slowly where it decays slowly, either\r\nbecause of the climate or the resistance of the rock. It may be\r\nrapidly removed by a stream flowing along its base.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 8. Talus at Foot of Granite Cliffs, Sierra\r\n     Nevada Mountains]\r\n\r\nIn a moist climate a soluble rock, such as massive limestone, may form\r\ntalus little if any faster than the talus weathers away. A\r\nloose-textured sandstone breaks down into incoherent sand grains,\r\nwhich in dry climates, where unprotected by vegetation, may be blown\r\naway as fast as they fall, leaving the cliff bare to the base. Cliffs\r\nof such slow-decaying rocks as quartzite and granite when closely\r\njointed accumulate talus in large amounts.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 9. Diagram Illustrating Retreat of Cliff,\r\n     _c_, and Talus, _t_]\r\n\r\nTalus slopes may be so steep as to reach _the angle of repose_, i.e.\r\nthe steepest angle at which the material will lie. This angle varies\r\nwith different materials, being greater with coarse and angular\r\nfragments than with fine rounded grains. Sooner or later a talus\r\nreaches that equilibrium where the amount removed from its surface\r\njust equals that supplied from the cliff above. As the talus is\r\nremoved and weathers away its slope retreats together with the retreat\r\nof the cliff, as seen in Figure 9.\r\n\r\n=Graded slopes.= Where rocks weather faster than their waste is\r\ncarried away, the waste comes at last to cover all rocky ledges. On\r\nthe steeper slopes it is coarser and in more rapid movement than on\r\nslopes more gentle, but mountain sides and hills and plains alike come\r\nto be mantled with sheets of waste which everywhere is creeping toward\r\nthe streams. Such unbroken slopes, worn or built to the least\r\ninclination at which the waste supplied by weathering can be urged\r\nonward, are known as _graded slopes_.\r\n\r\nOf far less importance than the silent, gradual creep of waste, which\r\nis going on at all times everywhere about us, are the startling local\r\nand spasmodic movements which we are now to describe.\r\n\r\n=Avalanches.= On steep mountain sides the accumulated snows of winter\r\noften slip and slide in avalanches to the valleys below. These rushing\r\ntorrents of snow sweep their tracks clean of waste and are one of\r\nNature's normal methods of moving it along the downhill path.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 10. A Landslide, Quebec]\r\n\r\n=Landslides.= Another common and abrupt method of delivering waste to\r\nstreams is by slips of the waste mantle in large masses. After long\r\nrains and after winter frosts the cohesion between the waste and the\r\nsound rock beneath is loosened by seeping water underground. The waste\r\nslips on the rock surface thus lubricated and plunges down the\r\nmountain side in a swift roaring torrent of mud and stones.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 11. Diagram Illustrating Conditions favorable\r\n     to a Landslide\r\n\r\n   _lm_, limestone dipping toward valley of river, _r_; _sh_, shale]\r\n\r\nWe may conveniently mention here a second type of landslide, where\r\nmasses of solid rock as well as the mantle of waste are involved in\r\nthe sudden movement. Such slips occur when valleys have been rapidly\r\ndeepened by streams or glaciers and their sides have not yet been\r\ngraded. A favorable condition is where the strata dip (i.e. incline\r\ndownwards) towards the valley (Fig. 11), or are broken by joint planes\r\ndipping in the same direction. The upper layers, including perhaps the\r\nentire mountain side, have been cut across by the valley trench and\r\nare left supported only on the inclined surface of the underlying\r\nrocks. Water may percolate underground along this surface and loosen\r\nthe cohesion between the upper and the underlying strata by converting\r\nthe upper surface of a shale to soft wet clay, by dissolving layers of\r\na limestone, or by removing the cement of a sandstone and converting\r\nit into loose sand. When the inclined surface is thus lubricated the\r\noverlying masses may be launched into the valley below. The solid\r\nrocks are broken and crushed in sliding and converted into waste\r\nconsisting, like that of talus, of angular unsorted fragments, blocks\r\nof all sizes being mingled pell-mell with rock meal and dust. The\r\nprincipal effects of landslides may be gathered from the following\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nAt Gohna, India, in 1893, the face of a spur four thousand feet high,\r\nof the lower ranges of the Himalayas, slipped into the gorge of the\r\nheadwaters of the Ganges River in successive rock falls which lasted\r\nfor three days. Blocks of stone were projected for a mile, and clouds\r\nof limestone dust were spread over the surrounding country. The débris\r\nformed a dam one thousand feet high, extending for two miles along the\r\nvalley. A lake gathered behind this barrier, gradually rising until it\r\novertopped it in a little less than a year. The upper portion of the\r\ndam then broke, and a terrific rush of water swept down the valley in\r\na wave which, twenty miles away, rose one hundred and sixty feet in\r\nheight. A narrow lake is still held by the strong base of the dam.\r\n\r\nIn 1896, after forty days of incessant rain, a cliff of sandstone\r\nslipped into the Yangtse River in China, reducing the width of the\r\nchannel to eighty yards and causing formidable rapids.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 12. Bowlders of Weathering, Granite Quarry,\r\n     Cape Ann, Massachusetts]\r\n\r\nAt Flims, in Switzerland, a prehistoric landslip flung a dam eighteen\r\nhundred feet high across the headwaters of the Rhine. If spread evenly\r\nover a surface of twenty-eight square miles, the material would cover\r\nit to a depth of six hundred and sixty feet. The barrier is not yet\r\nentirely cut away, and several lakes are held in shallow basins on its\r\nhummocky surface.\r\n\r\nA slide from the precipitous river front of the citadel hill of\r\nQuebec, in 1889, dashed across Champlain Street, wrecking a number of\r\nhouses and causing the death of forty-five persons. The strata here\r\nare composed of steeply dipping slate (Fig. 10).\r\n\r\nIn lofty mountain ranges there may not be a single valley without its\r\ntraces of landslides, so common there is this method of the movement\r\nof waste, and of building to grade over-steepened slopes.\r\n\r\n\r\nRock Sculpture By Weathering\r\n\r\nWe are now to consider a few of the forms into which rock masses are\r\ncarved by the weather.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 13. Differential Weathering on a Monument,\r\n     Colorado]\r\n\r\n=Bowlders of weathering.= In many quarries and outcrops we may see\r\nthat the blocks into which one or more of the uppermost layers have\r\nbeen broken along their joints and bedding planes are no longer\r\nangular, as are those of the layers below. The edges and corners of\r\nthese blocks have been worn away by the weather. Such rounded cores,\r\nknown as bowlders of weathering, are often left to strew the surface.\r\n\r\n=Differential weathering.= This term covers all cases in which a rock\r\nmass weathers differently in different portions. Any weaker spots or\r\nlayers are etched out on the surface, leaving the more resistant in\r\nrelief. Thus massive limestones become pitted where the weather drills\r\nout the weaker portions. In these pits, when once they are formed,\r\nmoisture gathers, a little soil collects, vegetation takes root, and\r\nthus they are further enlarged until the limestone may be deeply\r\nhoneycombed.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 14. Honeycombed Limestone, Iowa]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 15. Cliffs and Slopes on North Wall of the\r\n     Grand Canyon of the Colorado River, Arizona]\r\n\r\nOn the sides of canyons, and elsewhere where the edges of strata are\r\nexposed, the harder layers project as cliffs, while the softer weather\r\nback to slopes covered with the talus of the harder layers above them.\r\nIt is convenient to call the former _cliff makers_ and the latter\r\n_slope makers_ (Fig. 15).\r\n\r\nDifferential weathering plays a large part in the sculpture of the\r\nland. Areas of weak rock are wasted to plains, while areas of hard\r\nrock adjacent are still left as hills and mountain ridges, as in the\r\nvalleys and mountains of eastern Pennsylvania. But in such instances\r\nthe lowering of the surface of the weaker rock is also due to the wear\r\nof streams, and especially to the removal by them from the land of the\r\nwaste which covers and protects the rocks beneath.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 16. Taverlone Mesa, New Mexico]\r\n\r\nRocks owe their weakness to several different causes. Some, such as\r\nbeds of loose sand, are soft and easily worn by rains; some, as\r\nlimestone and gypsum for example, are soluble. Even hard insoluble\r\nrocks are weak under the attack of the weather when they are closely\r\ndivided by joints and bedding planes and are thus readily broken up\r\ninto blocks by mechanical agencies.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 17. Monuments, Arizona\r\n\r\n    Note the rain furrows on the slope at the foot of the monuments.\r\n    In the foreground are seen fragments of petrified trunks of trees,\r\n    composed of silica and extremely resistant to the weather. On the\r\n    removal of the rock layers in which these fragments were imbedded\r\n    they are left to strew the surface in the same way as are the\r\n    residual flints of southern Missouri.]\r\n\r\n=Outliers and monuments.= As cliffs retreat under the attack of the\r\nweather, portions are left behind where the rock is more resistant or\r\nwhere the attack for any reason is less severe. Such remnant masses,\r\nif large, are known as outliers. When flat-topped, because of the\r\nprotection of a resistant horizontal capping layer, they are termed\r\n_mesas_ (Fig. 16),--a term applied also to the flat-topped portions of\r\ndissected plateaus (Fig. 129). Retreating cliffs may fall back a\r\nnumber of miles behind their outliers before the latter are finally\r\nconsumed.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 18. Undercut Monuments, Colorado]\r\n\r\nMonuments are smaller masses and may be but partially detached from\r\nthe cliff face. In the breaking down of sheets of horizontal strata,\r\noutliers grow smaller and smaller and are reduced to massive\r\nrectangular monuments resembling castles (Fig. 17). The rock castle\r\nfalls into ruin, leaving here and there an isolated tower; the tower\r\ncrumbles to a lonely pillar, soon to be overthrown. The various and\r\noften picturesque shapes of monuments depend on the kind of rock, the\r\nattitude of the strata, and the agent by which they are chiefly\r\ncarved. Thus pillars may have a capital formed of a resistant stratum.\r\nMonuments may be undercut and come to rest on narrow pedestals,\r\nwherever they weather more rapidly near the ground, either because of\r\nthe greater moisture there, or--in arid climates--because worn at\r\ntheir base by drifting sands.\r\n\r\nStony clays disintegrating under the rain often contain bowlders\r\nwhich protect the softer material beneath from the vertical blows\r\nof raindrops, and thus come to stand on pedestals of some height\r\n(Fig. 19). One may sometimes see on the ground beneath dripping eaves\r\npebbles left in the same way, protecting tiny pedestals of sand.\r\n\r\n=Mountain peaks and ridges.= Most mountains have been carved out of\r\ngreat broadly uplifted folds and blocks of the earth's crust. Running\r\nwater and glacier ice have cut these folds and blocks into masses\r\ndivided by deep valleys; but it is by the weather, for the most part,\r\nthat the masses thus separated have been sculptured to the present\r\nforms of the individual peaks and ridges.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 19. Roosevelt Column, Idaho\r\n\r\n   An erosion pillar 70 feet high. How was it produced? Why\r\n   quadrangular? What does it show as to the recent height of the\r\n   hillside surface?]\r\n\r\nFrost and heat and cold sculpture high mountains to sharp, tusklike\r\npeaks and ragged, serrate crests, where their waste is readily removed\r\n(Fig. 8).\r\n\r\nThe Matterhorn of the Alps is a famous example of a mountain peak\r\nwhose carving by the frost and other agents is in active progress. On\r\nits face \"scarcely a rock anywhere is firmly attached,\" and the fall\r\nof loosened stones is incessant. Mountain climbers who have camped at\r\nits base tell how huge rocks from time to time come leaping down its\r\nprecipices, followed by trains of dislodged smaller fragments and rock\r\ndust; and how at night one may trace the course of the bowlders by the\r\nsparks which they strike from the mountain walls. Mount Assiniboine,\r\nCanada (Fig. 20), resembles the Matterhorn in form and has been carved\r\nby the same agencies.\r\n\r\n\"The Needles\" of Arizona are examples of sharp mountain peaks in a\r\nwarm arid region sculptured chiefly by temperature changes.\r\n\r\nChemical decay, especially when carried on beneath a cover of waste\r\nand vegetation, favors the production of rounded knobs and dome-shaped\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\n=The weather curve.= We have seen that weathering reduces the angular\r\nblock quarried by the frost to a rounded bowlder by chipping off its\r\ncorners and smoothing away its edges. In much the same way weathering\r\nat last reduces to rounded hills the earth blocks cut by streams or\r\nformed in any other way. High mountains may at first be sculptured by\r\nthe weather to savage peaks (Fig. 181), but toward the end of their\r\nlife history they wear down to rounded hills (Fig. 182). The weather\r\ncurve, which may be seen on the summits of low hills (Fig. 21), is\r\nconvex upward.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 20. Mount Assiniboine, Canada]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 21. Big Round Top and Little Round Top,\r\n     Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]\r\n\r\nIn Figure 22, representing a cubic block of stone whose faces are a\r\nyard square, how many square feet of surface are exposed to the\r\nweather by a cubic foot at a corner _a_; by one situated in the middle\r\nof an edge _b_; by one in the center of a side _c_? How much faster\r\nwill _a_ and _b_ weather than _c_, and what will be the effect on the\r\nshape of the block?\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 22]\r\n\r\n=The coöperation of various agencies in rock sculpture.= For the sake\r\nof clearness it is necessary to describe the work of each geological\r\nagent separately. We must not forget, however, that in Nature no agent\r\nworks independently and alone; that every result is the outcome of a\r\nlong chain of causes. Thus, in order that the mountain peak may be\r\ncarved by the agents of disintegration, the waste must be rapidly\r\nremoved,--a work done by many agents, including some which we are yet\r\nto study; and in order that the waste may be removed as fast as\r\nformed, the region must first have been raised well above the level of\r\nthe sea, so that the agents of transportation could do their work\r\neffectively. The sculpture of the rocks is accomplished only by the\r\ncoöperation of many forces.\r\n\r\nThe constant removal of waste from the surface by creep and wash and\r\ncarriage by streams is of the highest importance, because it allows\r\nthe destruction of the land by means of weathering to go on as long as\r\nany land remains above sea level. If waste were not removed, it would\r\ngrow to be so thick as to protect the rock beneath from further\r\nweathering, and the processes of destruction which we have studied\r\nwould be brought to an end. The very presence of the mantle of waste\r\nover the land proves that on the whole rocks weather more rapidly than\r\ntheir waste is removed. The destruction of the land is going on as\r\nfast as the waste can be carried away.\r\n\r\nWe have now learned to see in the mantle of waste the record of the\r\ndestructive action of the agencies of weathering on the rocks of the\r\nland surface. Similar records we shall find buried deeply among the\r\nrocks of the crust in old soils and in rocks pitted and decayed,\r\ntelling of old land surfaces long wasted by the weather. Ever since\r\nthe dry land appeared these agencies have been as now quietly and\r\nunceasingly at work upon it, and have ever been the chief means of the\r\ndestruction of its rocks. The vast bulk of the stratified rocks of the\r\nearth's crust is made up almost wholly of the waste thus worn from\r\nancient lands.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 23. Mount Sneffels, Colorado\r\n\r\n   Describe and account for what you see in this view. What\r\n   changes may the mountain be expected to undergo in the future\r\n   from the agencies now at work upon it?]\r\n\r\nIn studying the various geological agencies we must remember the\r\nalmost inconceivable times in which they work. The slowest process\r\nwhen multiplied by the immense time in which it is carried on produces\r\ngreat results. The geologist looks upon the land forms of the earth's\r\nsurface as monuments which record the slow action of weathering and\r\nother agents during the ages of the past. The mountain peak, the\r\nrounded hill, the wide plain which lies where hills and mountains once\r\nstood, tell clearly of the great results which slow processes will\r\nreach when given long time in which to do their work. We should\r\naccustom ourselves also to think of the results which weathering will\r\nsooner or later bring to pass. The tombstone and the bowlder of the\r\nfield, which each year lose from their surfaces a few crystalline\r\ngrains, must in time be wholly destroyed. The hill whose rocks are\r\nslowly rotting underneath a cover of waste must become lower and lower\r\nas the centuries and millenniums come and go, and will finally\r\ndisappear. Even the mountains are crumbling away continually, and\r\ntherefore are but fleeting features of the landscape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE WORK OF GROUND WATER\r\n\r\n\r\n=Land waters.= We have seen how large is the part that water plays at\r\nand near the surface of the land in the processes of weathering and in\r\nthe slow movement of waste down all slopes to the stream ways. We now\r\ntake up the work of water as it descends beneath the ground,--a\r\ncorrosive agent still, and carrying in solution as its load the\r\ninvisible waste of rocks derived from their soluble parts.\r\n\r\nLand waters have their immediate source in the rainfall. By the heat\r\nof the sun water is evaporated from the reservoir of the ocean and\r\nfrom moist surfaces everywhere. Mingled as vapor with the air, it is\r\ncarried by the winds over sea and land, and condensed it returns to\r\nthe earth as rain or snow. That part of the rainfall which descends on\r\nthe ocean does not concern us, but that which falls on the land\r\naccomplishes, as it returns to the sea, the most important work of all\r\nsurface geological agencies.\r\n\r\nThe rainfall may be divided into three parts: the first _dries up_,\r\nbeing discharged into the air by evaporation either directly from the\r\nsoil or through vegetation; the second _runs off_ over the surface to\r\nflood the streams; the third _soaks in_ the ground and is henceforth\r\nknown as _ground_ or _underground water_.\r\n\r\n=The descent of ground water.= Seeping through the mantle of waste,\r\nground water soaks into the pores and crevices of the underlying rock.\r\nAll rocks of the upper crust of the earth are more or less porous, and\r\nall drink in water. _Impervious rocks_, such as granite, clay, and\r\nshale, have pores so minute that the water which they take in is held\r\nfast within them by capillary attraction, and none drains through.\r\n_Pervious rocks_, on the other hand, such as many sandstones, have\r\npore spaces so large that water filters through them more or less\r\nfreely. Besides its seepage through the pores of pervious rocks, water\r\npasses to lower levels through the joints and cracks by which all\r\nrocks, near the surface are broken.\r\n\r\nEven the closest-grained granite has a pore space of 1 in 400, while\r\nsandstone may have a pore space of 1 in 4. Sand is so porous that it\r\nmay absorb a third of its volume of water, and a loose loam even as\r\nmuch as one half.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 24. Diagram Illustrating the Relation of the\r\n      Ground-Water Surface to the Surface of the Ground\r\n\r\n   The dotted line represents the ground-water surface, and the\r\n   arrows indicate the direction of the movements of ground-water.\r\n   _m_, marsh; _w_, well; _r_, river]\r\n\r\n=The ground-water surface= is the name given the upper surface of\r\nground water, the level below which all rocks are saturated. In dry\r\nseasons the ground-water surface sinks. For ground water is constantly\r\nseeping downward under gravity, it is evaporated in the waste and its\r\nmoisture is carried upward by capillarity and the roots of plants to\r\nthe surface to be evaporated in the air. In wet seasons these constant\r\nlosses are more than made good by fresh supplies from that part of the\r\nrainfall which soaks into the ground, and the ground-water surface\r\nrises.\r\n\r\nIn moist climates the ground-water surface (Fig. 24) lies, as a rule,\r\nwithin a few feet of the land surface and conforms to it in a general\r\nway, although with slopes of less inclination than those of the hills\r\nand valleys. In dry climates permanent ground water may be found only\r\nat depths of hundreds of feet. Ground water is held at its height by\r\nthe fact that its circulation is constantly impeded by capillarity and\r\nfriction. If it were as free to drain away as are surface streams, it\r\nwould sink soon after a rain to the level of the deepest valleys of\r\nthe region.\r\n\r\n=Wells and springs.= Excavations made in permeable rocks below the\r\nground-water surface fill to its level and are known as wells. Where\r\nvalleys cut this surface permanent streams are formed, the water\r\neither oozing forth along ill-defined areas or issuing at definite\r\npoints called springs, where it is concentrated by the structure of\r\nthe rocks. A level tract where the ground-water surface coincides with\r\nthe surface of the ground is a swamp or marsh.\r\n\r\nBy studying a spring one may learn much of the ways and work of ground\r\nwater. Spring water differs from that of the stream into which it\r\nflows in several respects. If we test the spring with a thermometer\r\nduring successive months, we shall find that its temperature remains\r\nmuch the same the year round. In summer it is markedly cooler than the\r\nstream; in winter it is warmer and remains unfrozen while the latter\r\nperhaps is locked in ice. This means that its underground path must\r\nlie at such a distance from the surface that it is little affected by\r\nsummer's heat and winter's cold.\r\n\r\nWhile the stream is often turbid with surface waste washed into it by\r\nrains, the spring remains clear; its water has been filtered during\r\nits slow movement through many small underground passages and the\r\npores of rocks. Commonly the spring differs from the stream in that it\r\ncarries a far larger load of dissolved rock. Chemical analysis proves\r\nthat streams contain various minerals in solution, but these are\r\nusually in quantities so small that they are not perceptible to the\r\ntaste or feel. But the water of springs is often well charged with\r\nsoluble minerals; in its slow, long journey underground it has\r\nsearched out the soluble parts of the rocks through which it seeps and\r\nhas dissolved as much of them as it could. When spring water is boiled\r\naway, the invisible load which it has carried is left behind, and in\r\ncomposition is found to be practically identical with that of the\r\nsoluble ingredients of the country rock. Although to some extent the\r\nsoluble waste of rocks is washed down surface slopes by the rain, by\r\nfar the larger part is carried downward by ground water and is\r\ndelivered to streams by springs.\r\n\r\nIn limestone regions springs are charged with calcium carbonate (the\r\ncarbonate of lime), and where the limestone is magnesian they contain\r\nmagnesium carbonate also. Such waters are \"hard\"; when used in\r\nwashing, the minerals which they contain combine with the fatty acids\r\nof soap to form insoluble curdy compounds. When springs rise from\r\nrocks containing gypsum they are hard with calcium sulphate. In\r\ngranite regions they contain more or less soda and potash from the\r\ndecay of feldspar.\r\n\r\nThe flow of springs varies much less during the different seasons of\r\nthe year than does that of surface streams. So slow is the movement of\r\nground water through the rocks that even during long droughts large\r\namounts remain stored above the levels of surface drainage.\r\n\r\n=Movements of ground water.= Ground water is in constant movement\r\ntoward its outlets. Its rate varies according to many conditions, but\r\nalways is extremely slow. Even through loose sands beneath the beds of\r\nrivers it sometimes does not exceed a fifth of a mile a year.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 26.

The _upper zone\r\nof flow_ extends from the ground-water surface downward through the\r\nwaste mantle and any permeable rocks on which the mantle rests, as far\r\nas the first impermeable layer, where the descending movement of the\r\nwater is stopped. The =deep zones of flow= occupy any pervious rocks\r\nwhich may be found below the impervious layer which lies nearest to\r\nthe surface. The upper zone is a vast sheet of water saturating the\r\nsoil and rocks and slowly seeping downward through their pores and\r\ninterstices along the slopes to the valleys, where in part it\r\ndischarges in springs and often unites also in a wide underflowing\r\nstream which supports and feeds the river (Fig. 24).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 27.

Are these wells fed by water from the\r\nriver percolating through the sand, or by ground water on its way to\r\nthe stream and possibly contaminated with the sewage of the town?\r\n\r\nAt what height does underground water stand in the wells of your\r\nregion? Does it vary with the season? Have you ever known wells to go\r\ndry? It may be possible to get data from different wells and to draw a\r\ndiagram showing the ground-water surface as compared with the surface\r\nof the ground.\r\n\r\n=Fissure springs and artesian wells.= The _deeper zones of flow_ lie\r\nin pervious strata which are overlain by some impervious stratum. Such\r\nlayers are often carried by their dip to great depths, and water may\r\ncirculate in them to far below the level of the surface streams and\r\neven of the sea. When a fissure crosses a water-bearing stratum, or\r\n_aquifer, water is forced upward by the pressure of the weight of\r\nthe water contained in the higher parts of the stratum, and may reach\r\nthe surface as a fissure spring. A boring which taps such an aquifer\r\nis known as an artesian well, a name derived from a province in France\r\nwhere wells of this kind have been long in use. The rise of the water\r\nin artesian wells, and in fissure springs also, depends on the\r\nfollowing conditions illustrated in Figure 29. The aquifer dips toward\r\nthe region of the wells from higher ground, where it outcrops and\r\nreceives its water. It is inclosed between an impervious layer above\r\nand water-tight or water-logged layers beneath. The weight of the\r\ncolumn of water thus inclosed in the aquifer causes water to rise in\r\nthe well, precisely as the weight of the water in a standpipe forces\r\nit in connected pipes to the upper stories of buildings.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 29. Section across South Dakota from the\r\n      Black Hills to Sioux Falls (S), Illustrating the Conditions\r\n      of Artesian Wells\r\n\r\n   _a_, crystalline impervious rocks; _b_, sedimentary rocks,\r\n   shales, limestones, and sandstones; _c_, pervious sandstone,\r\n   the aquifer; _d_, impervious shales; _w_, _w_, _w_, artesian wells.]\r\n\r\nWhich will supply the larger region with artesian wells, an aquifer\r\nwhose dip is steep or one whose dip is gentle? Which of the two\r\naquifers, their thickness being equal, will have the larger outcrop\r\nand therefore be able to draw upon the larger amount of water from the\r\nrainfall? Illustrate with diagrams.\r\n\r\n=The zone of solution.= Near the surface, where the circulation of\r\nground water is most active, it oxidizes, corrodes, and dissolves the\r\nrocks through which it passes. It leaches soils and subsoils of their\r\nlime and other soluble minerals upon which plants depend for their\r\nfood. It takes away the soluble cements of rocks; it widens fissures\r\nand joints and opens winding passages along the bedding planes; it may\r\neven remove whole beds of soluble rocks, such as rock salt, limestone,\r\nor gypsum. The work of ground water in producing landslides has\r\nalready been noticed. The zone in which the work of ground water is\r\nthus for the most part destructive we may call the zone of solution.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 30. Diagram of Caverns and Sink Holes]\r\n\r\n=Caves.= In massive limestone rocks, ground water dissolves channels\r\nwhich sometimes form large caves (Fig. 30). The necessary conditions\r\nfor the excavation of caves of great size are well shown in central\r\nKentucky, where an upland is built throughout of thick horizontal beds\r\nof limestone. The absence of layers of insoluble or impervious rock in\r\nits structure allows a free circulation of ground water within it by\r\nthe way of all natural openings in the rock. These water ways have\r\nbeen gradually enlarged by solution and wear until the upland is\r\nhoneycombed with caves. Five hundred open caverns are known in one\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nMammoth Cave, the largest of these caverns, consists of a labyrinth of\r\nchambers and winding galleries whose total length is said to be as\r\nmuch as thirty miles. One passage four miles long has an average width\r\nof about sixty feet and an average height of forty feet. One of the\r\ngreat halls is three hundred feet in width and is overhung by a solid\r\narch of limestone one hundred feet above the floor. Galleries at\r\ndifferent levels are connected by well-like pits, some of which\r\nmeasure two hundred and twenty-five feet from top to bottom. Through\r\nsome of the lowest of these tunnels flows Echo River, still at work\r\ndissolving and wearing away the rock while on its dark way to appear\r\nat the surface as a great spring.\r\n\r\n=Natural bridges.= As a cavern enlarges and the surface of the land\r\nabove it is lowered by weathering, the roof at last breaks down and\r\nthe cave becomes an open ravine. A portion of the roof may for a while\r\nremain, forming a \"natural bridge.\"\r\n\r\n=Sink holes.= In limestone regions channels under ground may become so\r\nwell developed that the water of rains rapidly drains away through\r\nthem. Ground water stands low and wells must be sunk deep to find it.\r\nLittle or no surface water is left to form brooks.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 31. Sink Holes in the Karst, Austria]\r\n\r\nThus across the limestone upland of central Kentucky one meets but\r\nthree surface streams in a hundred miles. Between their valleys\r\nsurface water finds its way underground by means of sink holes. These\r\nare pits, commonly funnel shaped, formed by the enlargement of crevice\r\nor joint by percolating water, or by the breakdown of some portion of\r\nthe roof of a cave. By clogging of the outlet a sink hole may come to\r\nbe filled by a pond.\r\n\r\nCentral Florida is a limestone region with its drainage largely\r\nsubterranean and in part below the level even of the sea. Sink holes\r\nare common, and many of them are occupied by lakelets. Great springs\r\nmark the point of issue of underground streams, while some rise from\r\nbeneath the sea. Silver Spring, one of the largest, discharges from a\r\nbasin eight hundred feet wide and thirty feet deep a little river\r\nnavigable for small steamers to its source. About the spring there are\r\nno surface streams for sixty miles.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 32. Underground Stream Issuing from Base of\r\n      Cliff, the Karst, Austria]\r\n\r\n=The Karst.= Along the eastern coast of the Adriatic, as far south as\r\nMontenegro, lies a belt of limestone mountains singularly worn and\r\nhoneycombed by the solvent action of water. Where forests have been\r\ncut from the mountain sides and the red soil has washed away, the\r\nsurface of the white limestone forms a pathless desert of rock where\r\neach square rod has been corroded into an intricate branch work of\r\nshallow furrows and sharp ridges. Great sink holes, some of them six\r\nhundred feet deep and more, pockmark the surface of the land. The\r\ndrainage is chiefly subterranean. Surface streams are rare and a\r\nportion of their courses is often under ground. Fragmentary valleys\r\ncome suddenly to an end at walls of rock where the rivers which occupy\r\nthe valleys plunge into dark tunnels to reappear some miles away.\r\nGround water stands so far below the surface that it cannot be reached\r\nby wells, and the inhabitants depend on rain water stored for\r\nhousehold uses. The finest cavern of Europe, the Adelsberg Grotto, is\r\nin this region. Karst, the name of a part of this country, is now used\r\nto designate any region or landscape thus sculptured by the chemical\r\naction of surface and ground water. We must remember that Karst\r\nregions are rare, and striking as is the work of their subterranean\r\nstreams, it is far less important than the work done by the sheets of\r\nunderground water slowly seeping through all subsoils and porous rocks\r\nin other regions.\r\n\r\nEven when gathered into definite channels, ground water does not have\r\nthe erosive power of surface streams, since it carries with it little\r\nor no rock waste. Regions whose underground drainage is so perfect\r\nthat the development of surface streams has been retarded or prevented\r\nescape to a large extent the leveling action of surface running\r\nwaters, and may therefore stand higher than the surrounding country.\r\nThe hill honeycombed by Luray Cavern, Virginia, has been attributed to\r\nthis cause.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 33. Stalactites and Stalagmites, Marengo\r\n      Cavern, Indiana]\r\n\r\n=Cavern deposits.= Even in the zone of solution water may under\r\ncertain circumstances deposit as well as erode. As it trickles from\r\nthe roof of caverns, the lime carbonate which it has taken into\r\nsolution from the layers of limestone above is deposited by\r\nevaporation in the air in icicle-like pendants called _stalactites_.\r\nAs the drops splash on the floor there are built up in the same way\r\nthicker masses called _stalagmites_, which may grow to join the\r\nstalactites above, forming pillars. A stalagmitic crust often seals\r\nwith rock the earth which accumulates in caverns, together with\r\nwhatever relics of cave dwellers, either animals or men, it may\r\ncontain.\r\n\r\nCan you explain why slender stalactites formed by the drip of single\r\ndrops are often hollow pipes?\r\n\r\n=The zone of cementation.= With increasing depth subterranean water\r\nbecomes more and more sluggish in its movements and more and more\r\nhighly charged with minerals dissolved from the rocks above. At such\r\ndepths it deposits these minerals in the pores of rocks, cementing\r\ntheir grains together, and in crevices and fissures, forming mineral\r\nveins. Thus below the zone of solution where the work of water is to\r\ndissolve, lies the zone of cementation where its work is chemical\r\ndeposit. A part of the invisible load of waste is thus transferred\r\nfrom rocks near the surface to those at greater depths.\r\n\r\nAs the land surface is gradually lowered by weathering and the work of\r\nrain and streams, rocks which have lain deep within the zone of\r\ncementation are brought within the zone of solution. Thus there are\r\nexposed to view limestones, whose cracks were filled with calcite\r\n(crystallized carbonate of lime), with quartz or other minerals, and\r\nsandstones whose grains were well cemented many feet below the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n=Cavity filling.= Small cavities in the rocks are often found more or\r\nless completely filled with minerals deposited from solution by water\r\nin its constant circulation underground. The process may be\r\nillustrated by the deposit of salt crystals in a cup of evaporating\r\nbrine, but in the latter instance the solution is not renewed as in\r\nthe case of cavities in the rocks. A cavity thus lined with\r\ninward-pointing crystals is called a _geode_.\r\n\r\n=Concretions.= Ground water seeping through the pores of rocks may\r\ngather minerals disseminated throughout them into nodular masses\r\ncalled concretions. Thus silica disseminated through limestone is\r\ngathered into nodules of flint. While geodes grow from the outside\r\ninwards, concretions grow outwards from the center. Nor are they\r\nformed in already existing cavities as are geodes. In soft clays\r\nconcretions may, as they grow, press the clay aside. In many other\r\nrocks concretions are made by the process of _replacement_. Molecule\r\nby molecule the rock is removed and the mineral of the concretion\r\nsubstituted in its place. The concretion may in this way preserve\r\nintact the lamination lines or other structures of the rock (Fig. 34).\r\nClays and shales often contain concretions of lime carbonate, of iron\r\ncarbonate, or of iron sulphide. Some fossil, such as a leaf or shell,\r\nfrequently forms the nucleus around which the concretion grows.\r\n\r\nWhy are building stones more easily worked when \"green\" than after\r\ntheir quarry water has dried out?\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 34. Concretions in Sandstone, Wyoming]\r\n\r\n=Deposits of ground water in arid regions.= In arid lands where ground\r\nwater is drawn by capillarity to the surface and there evaporates, it\r\nleaves as surface incrustations the minerals held in solution. White\r\nlimy incrustations of this nature cover considerable tracts in\r\nnorthern Mexico. Evaporating beneath the surface, ground water may\r\ndeposit a limy cement in beds of loose sand and gravel. Such firmly\r\ncemented layers are not uncommon in western Kansas and Nebraska, where\r\nthey are known as \"mortar beds.\"\r\n\r\n=Thermal springs.= While the lower limit of surface drainage is sea\r\nlevel, subterranean water circulates much below that depth, and is\r\nbrought again to the surface by hydrostatic pressure. In many\r\ninstances springs have a higher temperature than the average annual\r\ntemperature of the region, and are then known as thermal springs. In\r\nregions of present or recent volcanic activity, such as the\r\nYellowstone National Park, we may believe that the heat of thermal\r\nsprings is derived from uncooled lavas, perhaps not far below the\r\nsurface. But when hot springs occur at a distance of hundreds of miles\r\nfrom any volcano, as in the case of the hot springs of Bath, England,\r\nit is probable that their waters have risen from the heated rocks\r\nof the earth's interior. The springs of Bath have a temperature of\r\n120° F., 70° above the average annual temperature of the place. If\r\nwe assume that the rate of increase in the earth's internal heat is\r\nhere the average rate, 1° F. to every sixty feet of descent, we may\r\nconclude that the springs of Bath rise from at least a depth of\r\nforty-two hundred feet.\r\n\r\nWater may descend to depths from which it can never be brought back by\r\nhydrostatic pressure. It is absorbed by highly heated rocks deep below\r\nthe surface. From time to time some of this deep-seated water may be\r\nreturned to open air in the steam of volcanic eruptions.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 35. Calcareous Deposits from Hot Springs,\r\n      Yellowstone National Park]\r\n\r\n=Surface deposits of springs.= Where subterranean water returns to the\r\nsurface highly charged with minerals in solution, on exposure to the\r\nair it is commonly compelled to lay down much of its invisible load in\r\nchemical deposits about the spring. These are thrown down from\r\nsolution either because of cooling, evaporation, the loss of carbon\r\ndioxide, or the work of algae.\r\n\r\nMany springs have been charged under pressure with carbon dioxide from\r\nsubterranean sources and are able therefore to take up large\r\nquantities of lime carbonate from the limestone rocks through which\r\nthey pass. On reaching the surface the pressure is relieved, the gas\r\nescapes, and the lime carbonate is thrown down in deposits called\r\n_travertine_. The gas is sometimes withdrawn and the deposit produced\r\nin large part by the action of algae and other humble forms of plant\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAt the Mammoth Hot Springs in the valley of the Gardiner River,\r\nYellowstone National Park, beautiful terraces and basins of travertine\r\n(Fig. 35) are now building, chiefly by means of algae which cover the\r\nbottoms, rims, and sides of the basins and deposit lime carbonate upon\r\nthem in successive sheets. The rock, snow-white where dry, is coated\r\nwith red and orange gelatinous mats where the algae thrive in the\r\nover-flowing waters.\r\n\r\nSimilar terraces of travertine are found to a height of fourteen\r\nhundred feet up the valley side. We may infer that the springs which\r\nformed these ancient deposits discharged near what was then the bottom\r\nof the valley, and that as the valley has been deepened by the river\r\nthe ground water of the region has found lower and lower points of\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the country calcareous springs occur which coat with\r\nlime carbonate mosses, twigs, and other objects over which their\r\nwaters flow. Such are popularly known as petrifying springs, although\r\nthey merely incrust the objects and do not convert them into stone.\r\n\r\nSilica is soluble in alkaline waters, especially when these are hot.\r\nHot springs rising through alkaline siliceous rocks, such as lavas,\r\noften deposit silica in a white spongy formation known as _siliceous\r\nsinter_, both by evaporation and by the action of algae which secrete\r\nsilica from the waters. It is in this way that the cones and mounds of\r\nthe geysers in the Yellowstone National Park and in Iceland have been\r\nformed (Fig. 234).\r\n\r\nWhere water oozes from the earth one may sometimes see a rusty deposit\r\non the ground, and perhaps an iridescent scum upon the water. The scum\r\nis often mistaken for oil, but at a touch it cracks and breaks, as oil\r\nwould not do. It is a film of hydrated iron oxide, or _limonite_, and\r\nthe spring is an iron, or chalybeate, spring. Compounds of iron have\r\nbeen taken into solution by ground water from soil and rocks, and are\r\nnow changed to the insoluble oxide on exposure to the oxygen of the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nIn wet ground iron compounds leached by ground water from the soil\r\noften collect in reddish deposits a few feet below the surface, where\r\ntheir downward progress is arrested by some impervious clay. At the\r\nbottom of bogs and shallow lakes iron ores sometimes accumulate to a\r\ndepth of several feet.\r\n\r\nDecaying organic matter plays a large part in these changes. In its\r\npresence the insoluble iron oxides which give color to most red and\r\nyellow rocks are decomposed, leaving the rocks of a gray or bluish\r\ncolor, and the soluble iron compounds which result are readily leached\r\nout,--effects seen where red or yellow clays have been bleached about\r\nsome decaying tree root.\r\n\r\nThe iron thus dissolved is laid down as limonite when oxidized, as\r\nabout a chalybeate spring; but out of contact with the air and in the\r\npresence of carbon dioxide supplied by decaying vegetation, as in a\r\npeat bog, it may be deposited as iron carbonate, or _siderite_.\r\n\r\n=Total amount of underground waters.= In order to realize the vast work\r\nin solution and cementation which underground waters are now doing and\r\nhave done in all geological ages, we must gain some conception of their\r\namount. At a certain depth, estimated at about six miles, the weight of\r\nthe crust becomes greater than the rocks can bear, and all cavities and\r\npores in them must be completely closed by the enormous pressure which\r\nthey sustain. Below a depth, therefore, water cannot go. Above it all\r\nrocks are water-soaked, up to the limit of their capacity, to within a\r\nfew feet of the surface. Estimating the average pore space of the rocks\r\nabove a depth of six miles at from two and a half per cent to five per\r\ncent of their volume, it is found that the total amount of ground water\r\nmay be great enough to cover the entire surface of the earth to a depth\r\nof from eight hundred to sixteen hundred feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nRIVERS AND VALLEYS\r\n\r\n\r\n=The run-off.= We have traced the history of that portion of the\r\nrainfall which soaks into the ground; let us now return to that part\r\nwhich washes along the surface and is known as the _run-off_. Fed by\r\nrains and melting snows, the run-off gathers into courses, perhaps but\r\nfaintly marked at first, which join more definite and deeply cut\r\nchannels, as twigs their stems. In a humid climate the larger ravines\r\nthrough which the run-off flows soon descend below the ground-water\r\nsurface. Here springs discharge along the sides of the little valleys\r\nand permanent streams begin. The water supplied by the run-off here\r\njoins that part of the rainfall which had soaked into the soil, and\r\nboth now proceed together by way of the stream to the sea.\r\n\r\n=River floods.= Streams vary greatly in volume during the year. At\r\nstages of flood they fill their immediate banks, or overrun them and\r\ninundate any low lands adjacent to the channel; at stages of low water\r\nthey diminish to but a fraction of their volume when at flood.\r\n\r\nAt times of flood, rivers are fed chiefly by the run-off; at times of\r\nlow water, largely or even wholly by springs.\r\n\r\nHow, then, will the water of streams differ at these times in\r\nturbidity and in the relative amount of solids carried in solution?\r\n\r\nIn parts of England streams have been known to continue flowing after\r\neighteen months of local drought, so great is the volume of water\r\nwhich in humid climates is stored in the rocks above the drainage\r\nlevel, and so slowly is it given off in springs.\r\n\r\nIn Illinois and the states adjacent, rivers remain low in winter and a\r\n\"spring freshet\" follows the melting of the winter's snows. A \"June\r\nrise\" is produced by the heavy rains of early summer. Low water\r\nfollows in July and August, and streams are again swollen to a\r\nmoderate degree under the rains of autumn.\r\n\r\n=The discharge of streams.= The per cent of rainfall discharged by\r\nrivers varies with the amount of rainfall, the slope of the drainage\r\narea, the texture of the rocks, and other factors. With an annual\r\nrainfall of fifty inches in an open country, about fifty per cent is\r\ndischarged; while with a rainfall of twenty inches only fifteen per\r\ncent is discharged, part of the remainder being evaporated and part\r\npassing underground beyond the drainage area. Thus the Ohio discharges\r\nthirty per cent of the rainfall of its basin, while the Missouri\r\ncarries away but fifteen per cent. A number of the streams of the\r\nsemi-arid lands of the West do not discharge more than five per cent\r\nof the rainfall.\r\n\r\nOther things being equal, which will afford the larger proportion of\r\nrun-off, a region underlain with granite rock or with coarse\r\nsandstone? grass land or forest? steep slopes or level land? a\r\nwell-drained region or one abounding in marshes and ponds? frozen or\r\nunfrozen ground? Will there be a larger proportion of run-off after\r\nlong rains or after a season of drought? after long and gentle rains,\r\nor after the same amount of precipitation in a violent rain? during\r\nthe months of growing vegetation, from June to August, or during the\r\nautumn months?\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 36. Rise of Ground-Water Surface (broken\r\n      line) beneath Valley (_V_) in Arid Region]\r\n\r\n=Desert streams.= In arid regions the ground-water surface lies so low\r\nthat for the most part stream ways do not intersect it. Streams\r\ntherefore are not fed by springs, but instead lose volume as their\r\nwaters soak into the thirsty rocks over which they flow. They\r\ncontribute to the ground water of the region instead of being\r\nincreased by it. Being supplied chiefly by the run-off, they wither at\r\ntimes of drought to a mere trickle of water, to a chain of pools, or\r\ngo wholly dry, while at long intervals rains fill their dusty beds\r\nwith sudden raging torrents. Desert rivers therefore periodically\r\nshorten and lengthen their courses, withering back at times of drought\r\nfor scores of miles, or even for a hundred miles from the point\r\nreached by their waters during seasons of rain.\r\n\r\n=The geological work of streams.= The work of streams is of three\r\nkinds,--transportation, erosion, and deposition. Streams _transport_\r\nthe waste of the land; they wear, or _erode_, their channels both on\r\nbed and banks; and they _deposit_ portions of their load from time to\r\ntime along their courses, finally laying it down in the sea. Most of\r\nthe work of streams is done at times of flood.\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n\r\n=The invisible load of streams.= Of the waste which a river transports\r\nwe may consider first the invisible load which it carries in solution,\r\nsupplied chiefly by springs but also in part by the run-off and from\r\nthe solution of the rocks of its bed. More than half the dissolved\r\nsolids in the water of the average river consists of the carbonates of\r\nlime and magnesia; other substances are gypsum, sodium sulphate\r\n(Glauber's salts), magnesium sulphate (Epsom salts), sodium chloride\r\n(common salt), and even silica, the least soluble of the common\r\nrock-making minerals. The amount of this invisible load is\r\nsurprisingly large. The Mississippi, for example, transports each year\r\n113,000,000 tons of dissolved rock to the Gulf.\r\n\r\n=The visible load of streams.= This consists of the silt which the\r\nstream carries in suspension, and the sand and gravel and larger\r\nstones which it pushes along its bed. Especially in times of flood one\r\nmay note the muddy water, its silt being kept from settling by the\r\nrolling, eddying currents; and often by placing his ear close to the\r\nbottom of a boat one may hear the clatter of pebbles as they are\r\nhurried along. In mountain torrents the rumble of bowlders as they\r\nclash together may be heard some distance away. The amount of the load\r\nwhich a stream can transport depends on its velocity. A current of two\r\nthirds of a mile per hour can move fine sand, while one of four miles\r\nper hour sweeps along pebbles as large as hen's eggs. The transporting\r\npower of a stream varies as the sixth power of its velocity. If its\r\nvelocity is multiplied by two, its transporting power is multiplied by\r\nthe sixth power of two: it can now move stones sixty-four times as\r\nlarge as it could before.\r\n\r\nStones weigh from two to three times as much as water, and in water\r\nlose the weight of the volume of water which they displace. What\r\nproportion, then, of their weight in air do stones lose when\r\nsubmerged?\r\n\r\n=Measurement of stream loads.= To obtain the total amount of waste\r\ntransported by a river is an important but difficult matter. The\r\namount of water discharged must first be found by multiplying the\r\nnumber of square feet in the average cross section of the stream by\r\nits velocity per second, giving the discharge per second in cubic\r\nfeet. The amount of silt to a cubic foot of water is found by\r\nfiltering samples of the water taken from different parts of the\r\nstream and at different times in the year, and drying and weighing the\r\nresidues. The average amount of silt to the cubic foot of water,\r\nmultiplied by the number of cubic feet of water discharged per year,\r\ngives the total load carried in suspension during that time. Adding to\r\nthis the estimated amount of sand and gravel rolled along the bed,\r\nwhich in many swift rivers greatly exceeds the lighter material held\r\nin suspension, and adding also the total amount of dissolved solids,\r\nwe reach the exceedingly important result of the total load of waste\r\ndischarged by the river. Dividing the volume of this load by the area\r\nof the river basin gives another result of the greatest geological\r\ninterest,--the rate at which the region is being lowered by the\r\ncombined action of weathering and erosion, or the rate of denudation.\r\n\r\n=The rate of denudation of river basins.= This rate varies widely. The\r\nMississippi basin may be taken as a representative land surface\r\nbecause of the varieties of surface, altitude and slope, climate, and\r\nunderlying rocks which are included in its great extent. Careful\r\nmeasurements show that the Mississippi basin is now being lowered at a\r\nrate of one four-thousandth of a foot a year, or one foot in four\r\nthousand years. Taking this as the average rate of denudation for the\r\nland surfaces of the globe, estimates have been made of the length of\r\ntime required at this rate to wash and wear the continents to the\r\nlevel of the sea. As the average elevation of the lands of the globe\r\nis reckoned at 2411 feet, this result would occur in nine or ten\r\nmillion years, if the present rate of denudation should remain\r\nunchanged. But even if no movements of the earth's crust should lift\r\nor depress the continents, the rate of wear and the removal of waste\r\nfrom their surfaces will not remain the same. It must constantly\r\ndecrease as the lands are worn nearer to sea level and their slopes\r\nbecome more gentle. The length of time required to wear them away is\r\ntherefore far in excess of that just stated.\r\n\r\nThe drainage area of the Potomac is 11,000 square miles. The silt\r\nbrought down in suspension in a year would cover a square mile to the\r\ndepth of four feet. At what rate is the Potomac basin being lowered\r\nfrom this cause alone?\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the Upper Ganges is lowering its basin at the\r\nrate of one foot in 823 years, and the Po one foot in 720 years. Why\r\nso much faster than the Potomac and the Mississippi?\r\n\r\n=How streams get their loads.= The load of streams is derived from a\r\nnumber of sources, the larger part being supplied by the weathering of\r\nvalley slopes. We have noticed how the mantle of waste creeps and\r\nwashes to the stream ways. Watching the run-off during a rain, as it\r\nhurries muddy with waste along the gutter or washes down the hillside,\r\nwe may see the beginning of the route by which the larger part of\r\ntheir load is delivered to rivers. Streams also secure some of their\r\nload by wearing it from their beds and banks,--a process called\r\nerosion.\r\n\r\n\r\nErosion\r\n\r\nStreams erode their beds chiefly by means of their bottom load,--the\r\nstones of various sizes and the sand and even the fine mud which they\r\nsweep along. With these tools they smooth, grind, and rasp the rock of\r\ntheir beds, using them in much the fashion of sandpaper or a file.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 37. Pothole in Bed of Stream, Ireland]\r\n\r\n=Weathering of river beds.= The erosion of stream beds is greatly\r\nhelped by the work of the weather. Especially at low water more or\r\nless of the bed is exposed to the action of frost and heat and cold,\r\njoints are opened, rocks are pried loose and broken up and made ready\r\nto be swept away by the stream at time of flood.\r\n\r\n=Potholes.= In rapids streams also drill out their rocky beds. Where\r\nsome slight depression gives rise to an eddy, the pebbles which gather\r\nin it are whirled round and round, and, acting like the bit of an\r\nauger, bore out a cylindrical pit called a pothole. Potholes sometimes\r\nreach a depth of a score of feet. Where they are numerous they aid\r\nmaterially in deepening the channel, as the walls between them are\r\nworn away and they coalesce.\r\n\r\n=Waterfalls.= One of the most effective means of erosion which the\r\nriver possesses is the waterfall. The plunging water dislodges stones\r\nfrom the face of the ledge over which it pours, and often undermines\r\nit by excavating a deep pit at its base. Slice after slice is thus\r\nthrown down from the front of the cliff, and the cataract cuts its way\r\nupstream leaving a gorge behind it.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 38. Map of the Gorge of the Niagara River]\r\n\r\n=Niagara Falls.= The Niagara River flows from Lake Erie at Buffalo in\r\na broad channel which it has cut but a few feet below the level of the\r\nregion. Some thirteen miles from the outlet it plunges over a ledge\r\none hundred and seventy feet high into the head of a narrow gorge\r\nwhich extends for seven miles to the escarpment of the upland in which\r\nthe gorge is cut. The strata which compose the upland dip gently\r\nupstream and consist at top of a massive limestone, at the Falls about\r\neighty feet thick, and below of soft and easily weathered shale.\r\nBeneath the Falls the underlying shale is cut and washed away by the\r\ndescending water and retreats also because of weathering, while the\r\noverhanging limestone breaks down in huge blocks from time to time.\r\n\r\nNiagara is divided by Goat Island into the Horseshoe Falls and the\r\nAmerican Falls. The former is supplied by the main current of the\r\nriver, and from the semicircular sweep of its rim a sheet of water in\r\nplaces at least fifteen or twenty feet deep plunges into a pool a\r\nlittle less than two hundred feet in depth. Here the force of the\r\nfalling water is sufficient to move about the fallen blocks of\r\nlimestone and use them in the excavation of the shale of the bed. At\r\nthe American Falls the lesser branch of the river, which flows along\r\nthe American side of Goat Island, pours over the side of the gorge and\r\nbreaks upon a high talus of limestone blocks which its smaller volume\r\nof water is unable to grind to pieces and remove.\r\n\r\nA series of surveys have determined that from 1842 to 1890 the\r\nHorseshoe Falls retreated at the rate of 2.18 feet per year, while the\r\nAmerican Falls retreated at the rate of 0.64 feet in the same period.\r\nWe cannot doubt that the same agency which is now lengthening the\r\ngorge at this rapid rate has cut it back its entire length of seven\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nWhile Niagara Falls have been cutting back a gorge seven miles long\r\nand from two hundred to three hundred feet deep, the river above the\r\nFalls has eroded its bed scarcely below the level of the upland on\r\nwhich it flows. Like all streams which are the outlets of lakes, the\r\nNiagara flows out of Lake Erie clear of sediment, as from a settling\r\nbasin, and carries no tools with which to abrade its bed. We may infer\r\nfrom this instance how slight is the erosive power of clear water on\r\nhard rock.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 39. Longitudinal Section of Niagara Gorge\r\n\r\n   Black, water; _F_, falls; _R_, rapids; _W_, whirlpool;\r\n   _E_, escarpment; _N_, north; _S_, south]\r\n\r\nAssuming that the rate of recession of the combined volumes of the\r\nAmerican and Horseshoe Falls was three feet a year below Goat Island,\r\nand _assuming that this rate has been uniform in the past_, how long\r\nis it since the Niagara River fell over the edge of the escarpment\r\nwhere now is the mouth of the present gorge?\r\n\r\nThe profile of the bed of the Niagara along the gorge (Fig. 39) shows\r\nalternating deeps and shallows which cannot be accounted for, except\r\nin a single instance, by the relative hardness of the rocks of the\r\nriver bed. The deeps do not exceed that at the foot of the Horseshoe\r\nFalls at the present time. When the gorge was being cut along the\r\nshallows, how did the Falls compare in excavating power, in force, and\r\nvolume with the Niagara of to-day? How did the rate of recession at\r\nthose times compare with the present rate? Is the assumption made\r\nabove that the rate of recession has been uniform correct?\r\n\r\nThe first stretch of shallows below the Falls causes a tumultuous\r\nrapid impossible to sound. Its depth has been estimated at thirty-five\r\nfeet. From what data could such an estimate be made?\r\n\r\nSuggest a reason why the Horseshoe Falls are convex upstream.\r\n\r\nAt the present rate of recession which will reach the head of Goat\r\nIsland the sooner, the American or the Horseshoe Falls? What will be\r\nthe fate of the Falls left behind when the other has passed beyond the\r\nhead of the island?\r\n\r\nThe rate at which a stream erodes its bed depends in part upon the\r\nnature of the rocks over which it flows. Will a stream deepen its\r\nchannel more rapidly on massive or on thin-bedded and close-jointed\r\nrocks? on horizontal strata or on strata steeply inclined?\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 40. A Stream in Scotland\r\n\r\n   In what ways is the bed now being deepened?]\r\n\r\n\r\nDeposition\r\n\r\nWhile the river carries its invisible load of dissolved rock on\r\nwithout stop to the sea, its load of visible waste is subject to many\r\ndelays en route. Now and again it is laid aside, to be picked up later\r\nand carried some distance farther on its way. One of the most striking\r\nfeatures of the river therefore is the waste accumulated along its\r\ncourse, in bars and islands in the channel, beneath its bed, and in\r\nflood plains along its banks. All this _alluvium_, to use a general\r\nterm for river deposits, with which the valley is cumbered is really\r\nen route to the sea; it is only temporarily laid aside to resume its\r\njourney later on. Constantly the river is destroying and rebuilding\r\nits alluvial deposits, here cutting and there depositing along its\r\nbanks, here eroding and there building a bar, here excavating its bed\r\nand there filling it up, and at all times carrying the material picked\r\nup at one point some distance on downstream before depositing it at\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 41. Sand Bar deposited by Stream, showing\r\n      Cross Bedding]\r\n\r\nThese deposits are laid down by slackening currents where the velocity\r\nof the stream is checked, as on the inner side of curves, and where\r\nthe slope of the bed is diminished, and in the lee of islands, bridge\r\npiers and projecting points of land. How slight is the check required\r\nto cause a current to drop a large part of its load may be inferred\r\nfrom the law of the relation of the transporting power to the\r\nvelocity. If the velocity is decreased one half, the current can move\r\nfragments but one sixty-fourth the size of those which it could move\r\nbefore, and must drop all those of larger size.\r\n\r\nWill a river deposit more at low water or at flood? when rising or\r\nwhen falling?\r\n\r\n=Stratification.= River deposits are stratified, as may be seen in any\r\nfresh cut in banks or bars. The waste of which they are built has been\r\nsorted and deposited in layers, one above another; some of finer and\r\nsome of coarser material. The sorting action of running water depends\r\non the fact that its transporting power varies with the velocity. A\r\ncurrent whose diminishing velocity compels it to drop coarse gravel,\r\nfor example, is still able to move all the finer waste of its load,\r\nand separating it from the gravel, carries it on downstream; while at\r\na later time slower currents may deposit on the gravel bed layers of\r\nsand, and, still later, slack water may leave on these a layer of mud.\r\nIn case of materials lighter than water the transporting power does\r\nnot depend on the velocity, and logs of wood, for instance, are\r\nfloated on to the sea on the slowest as well as on the most rapid\r\ncurrents.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 42. Longitudinal Section of a River Bar]\r\n\r\n=Cross bedding.= A section of a bar exposed at low water may show that\r\nit is formed of layers of sand, or coarser stuff, inclined downstream\r\nas steeply often as the angle of repose of the material. From a boat\r\nanchored over the lower end of a submerged sand bar we may observe the\r\nway in which this structure, called cross bedding, is produced. Sand\r\nis continually pushed over the edge of the bar at _b_ (Fig. 42) and\r\ncomes to rest in successive layers on the sloping surface. At the same\r\ntime the bar may be worn away at the upper end, _a_, and thus slowly\r\nadvance down stream. While the deposit is thus cross bedded, it\r\nconstitutes as a whole a stratum whose upper and lower surfaces are\r\nabout horizontal. In sections of river banks one may often see a\r\nvertical succession of cross-bedded strata, each built in the way\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n=Water wear.= The coarser material of river deposits, such as\r\ncobblestones, gravel, and the larger grains of sand, are _water worn_,\r\nor rounded, except when near their source. Rolling along the bottom\r\nthey have been worn round by impact and friction as they rubbed\r\nagainst one another and the rocky bed of the stream.\r\n\r\nExperiments have shown that angular fragments of granite lose nearly\r\nhalf their weight and become well rounded after traveling fifteen\r\nmiles in rotating cylinders partly filled with water. Marbles are\r\ncheaply made in Germany out of small limestone cubes set revolving in\r\na current of water between a rotating bed of stone and a block of oak,\r\nthe process requiring but about fifteen minutes. It has been found\r\nthat in the upper reaches of mountain streams a descent of less than a\r\nmile is sufficient to round pebbles of granite.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 43. Water-Worn Pebbles, Upper Potomac River,\r\n      Maryland]\r\n\r\n\r\nLand Forms Due To River Erosion\r\n\r\n=River valleys.= In their courses to the sea, rivers follow valleys of\r\nvarious forms, some shallow and some deep, some narrow and some wide.\r\nSince rivers are known to erode their beds and banks, it is a fair\r\npresumption that, aided by the weather, they have excavated the\r\nvalleys in which they flow.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a bird's-eye view or a map of a region shows the significant\r\nfact that the valleys of a system unite with one another in a branch\r\nwork, as twigs meet their stems and the branches of a tree its trunk.\r\nEach valley, from that of the smallest rivulet to that of the master\r\nstream, is proportionate to the size of the stream which occupies it.\r\nWith a few explainable exceptions the valleys of tributaries join that\r\nof the trunk stream at a level; there is no sudden descent or break in\r\nthe bed at the point of juncture. These are the natural consequences\r\nwhich must follow if the land has long been worked upon by streams,\r\nand no other process has ever been suggested which is competent to\r\nproduce them. We must conclude that valley systems have been formed by\r\nthe river systems which drain them, aided by the work of the weather;\r\nthey are not gaping fissures in the earth's crust, as early observers\r\nimagined, but are the furrows which running water has drawn upon the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nAs valleys are made by the slow wear of streams and the action of the\r\nweather, they pass in their development through successive stages,\r\neach of which has its own characteristic features. We may therefore\r\nclassify rivers and valleys according to the stage which they have\r\nreached in their life history from infancy to old age.\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung River Valleys\r\n\r\n=Infancy.= The Red River of the North. A region in northwestern\r\nMinnesota and the adjacent portions of North Dakota and Manitoba was\r\nso recently covered by the waters of an extinct lake, known as Lake\r\nAgassiz, that the surface remains much as it was left when the lake\r\nwas drained away. The flat floor, spread smooth with lake-laid silts,\r\nis still a plain, to the eye as level as the sea. Across it the Red\r\nRiver of the North and its branches run in narrow, ditch-like\r\nchannels, steep-sided and shallow, not exceeding sixty feet in depth,\r\ntheir gradients differing little from the general slopes of the\r\nregion. The trunk streams have but few tributaries; the river system,\r\nlike a sapling with few limbs, is still undeveloped. Along the banks\r\nof the trunk streams short gullies are slowly lengthening headwards,\r\nlike growing twigs which are sometime to become large branches.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 44. A Young Lacustrine Plain; the Red River\r\n      of the North\r\n\r\n   Scale 5 inches = about 11 miles. Contour interval, 20 feet]\r\n\r\nThe flat interstream areas are as yet but little scored by drainage\r\nlines, and in wet weather water lingers in ponds in any initial\r\ndepressions on the plain.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 45. A Young River, Iowa\r\n\r\n   Note that it has hardly begun to cut in the plain of glacial\r\n   drift on which it flows]\r\n\r\n=Contours.= In order to read the topographic maps of the text-book and\r\nthe laboratory the student should know that contours are lines drawn\r\non maps to represent relief, all points on any given contour being of\r\nequal height above sea level. The _contour interval_ is the uniform\r\nvertical distance between two adjacent contours and varies on\r\ndifferent maps. To express regions of faint relief a contour interval\r\nof ten or twenty feet is commonly selected; while in mountainous\r\nregions a contour interval of two hundred and fifty, five hundred, or\r\neven one thousand feet may be necessary in order that the contours may\r\nnot be too crowded for easy reading.\r\n\r\nWhether a river begins its life on a lake plain, as in the example\r\njust cited, or upon a coastal plain lifted from beneath the sea or on\r\na spread of glacial drift left by the retreat of continental ice\r\nsheets, such as covers much of Canada and the northeastern parts of\r\nthe United States, its infantile stage presents the same\r\ncharacteristic features,--a narrow and shallow valley, with\r\nundeveloped tributaries and undrained interstream areas. Ground water\r\nstands high, and, exuding in the undrained initial depressions, forms\r\nmarshes and lakes.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 46. A Young Drift Region in Wisconsin\r\n\r\n    Describe this area. How high are the hills? Are they such in form\r\n    and position as would be left by stream erosion? Consult a map of\r\n    the entire state and notice that the Fox River finds its way to Lake\r\n    Michigan, while the Wisconsin empties into the Mississippi. Describe\r\n    that portion of the divide here shown between the Mississippi and\r\n    the St. Lawrence systems. Which is the larger river, the Wisconsin\r\n    or the Fox? Other things being equal, which may be expected to\r\n    deepen its bed the more rapidly? What changes are likely to occur\r\n    when one of these rivers comes to flow at a lower level than the\r\n    other? Why have not these changes occurred already?]\r\n\r\n=Lakes.= Lakes are perhaps the most obvious of these fleeting features\r\nof infancy. They are short-lived, for their destruction is soon\r\naccomplished by several means. As a river system advances toward\r\nmaturity the deepening and extending valleys of the tributaries lower\r\nthe ground-water surface and invade the undrained depressions of the\r\nregion. Lakes having outlets are drained away as their basin rims are\r\ncut down by the outflowing streams,--a slow process where the rim is\r\nof hard rock, but a rapid one where it is of soft material such as\r\nglacial drift.\r\n\r\nLakes are effaced also by the filling of their basins. Inflowing\r\nstreams and the wash of rains bring in waste. Waves abrade the shore\r\nand strew the débris worn from it over the lake bed. Shallow lakes are\r\noften filled with organic matter from decaying vegetation.\r\n\r\nDoes the outflowing stream, from a lake carry sediment? How does this\r\nfact affect its erosive power on hard rock? on loose material?\r\n\r\nLake Geneva is a well-known example of a lake in process of\r\nobliteration. The inflowing Rhone has already displaced the waters of\r\nthe lake for a length of twenty miles with the waste brought down from\r\nthe high Alps. For this distance there extends up the Rhone Valley an\r\nalluvial plain, which has grown lakeward at the rate of a mile and a\r\nhalf since Roman times, as proved by the distance inland at which a\r\nRoman port now stands.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 47. A Small Lake being broadened and shoaled\r\n      by Wave Wear\r\n\r\n   _ls_, lake surface; dotted line, initial shore;\r\n   _b_, fill made of material taken from _a_]\r\n\r\nHow rapidly a lake may be silted up under exceptionally favorable\r\nconditions is illustrated by the fact that over the bottom of the\r\nartificial lake, of thirty-five square miles, formed behind the great\r\ndam across the Colorado River at Austin, Texas, sediments thirty-nine\r\nfeet deep gathered in seven years.\r\n\r\nLake Mendota, one of the many beautiful lakes of southern Wisconsin,\r\nis rapidly cutting back the soft glacial drift of its shores by means\r\nof the abrasion of its waves. While the shallow basin is thus\r\nbroadened, it is also being filled with the waste; and the time is\r\nbrought nearer when it will be so shoaled that vegetation can complete\r\nthe work of its effacement.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 48. A Lake well-nigh effaced, Montana\r\n\r\n   By what means is the lake bed being filled?]\r\n\r\nAlong the margin of a shallow lake mosses, water lilies, grasses, and\r\nother water-loving plants grow luxuriantly. As their decaying remains\r\naccumulate on the bottom, the ring of marsh broadens inwards, the lake\r\nnarrows gradually to a small pond set in the midst of a wide bog, and\r\nfinally disappears. All stages in this process of extinction may be\r\nseen among the countless lakelets which occupy sags in the recent\r\nsheets of glacial drift in the northern states; and more numerous than\r\nthe lakes which still remain are those already thus filled with\r\ncarbonaceous matter derived from the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere.\r\nSuch fossil lakes are marked by swamps or level meadows underlain with\r\nmuck.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 49. A Level Meadow, Scotland\r\n\r\n   Explain its origin. What will be its future?]\r\n\r\n=The advance to maturity.= The infantile stage is brief. As a river\r\nadvances toward maturity the initial depressions, the lake basins of\r\nits area, are gradually effaced. By the furrowing action of the rain\r\nwash and the head ward lengthening, of tributaries a branchwork of\r\ndrainage channels grows until it covers the entire area, and not an\r\nacre is left on which the fallen raindrop does not find already cut\r\nfor it an uninterrupted downward path which leads it on by way of\r\ngully, brook, and river to the sea. The initial surface of the land,\r\nby whatever agency it was modeled, is now wholly destroyed; the region\r\nis all reduced to valley slopes.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 50. Drainage Maps\r\n\r\n   _A_, an area in its infancy, Buena Vista County, Iowa;\r\n   _B_, an area in its maturity, Ringgold County, Iowa]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 51. Successive Longitudinal Profiles of a\r\n      Stream\r\n\r\n   _am_, initial profile, with waterfall at _w_, and basins at _l_\r\n   and _l´_, which at first are occupied by lakes and later are\r\n   filled or drained; _b_, _c_, _d_, and _e_, profiles established\r\n   in succession as the stream advances from infancy toward old\r\n   age. Note that these profiles are concave toward the sky. This\r\n   is the _erosion curve_. What contrasting form has the weather\r\n   weather curve (p. 34)?]\r\n\r\n=The longitudinal profile of a stream.= This at first corresponds with\r\nthe initial surface of the region on which the stream begins to flow,\r\nalthough its way may lead through basins and down steep descents. The\r\nsuccessive profiles to which it reduces its bed are illustrated in\r\nFigure 51. As the gradient, or rate of descent of its bed, is lowered,\r\nthe velocity of the river is decreased until its lessening energy is\r\nwholly consumed in carrying its load and it can no longer erode its\r\nbed. The river is now _at grade_, and its capacity is just equal to\r\nits load. If now its load is increased the stream deposits, and thus\r\nbuilds up, or _aggrades_, its bed. On the other hand, if its load is\r\ndiminished it has energy to spare, and resuming its work of erosion,\r\n_degrades_ its bed. In either case the stream continues aggrading or\r\ndegrading until a new gradient is found where the velocity is just\r\nsufficient to move the load, and here again it reaches grade.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 52. A V-Valley,--the Canyon of the\r\n      Yellowstone\r\n\r\n   Note the steep sides. What processes are at work upon them? How\r\n   wide is the valley at the base compared with the width of the\r\n   stream? Do you see any river deposits along the banks? Is the\r\n   stream flowing swiftly over a rock bed, or quietly over a bed\r\n   which it has built up? Is it graded or ungraded? Note that the\r\n   canyon walls project in interlocking spurs]\r\n\r\n=V-Valleys.= Vigorous rivers well armed with waste make short work of\r\ncutting their beds to grade, and thus erode narrow, steep-sided gorges\r\nonly wide enough at the base to accommodate the stream. The steepness\r\nof the valley slopes depends on the relative rates at which the bed is\r\ncut down by the stream and the sides are worn back by the weather. In\r\nresistant rock a swift, well-laden stream may saw out a gorge whose\r\nsides are nearly or even quite vertical, but as a rule young valleys\r\nwhose streams have not yet reached grade are V-shaped; their sides\r\nflare at the top because here the rocks have longest been opened up to\r\nthe action of the weather. Some of the deepest canyons may be found\r\nwhere a rising land mass, either mountain range or plateau, has long\r\nmaintained by its continued uplift the rivers of the region above\r\ngrade.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 53. Section of the Yellowstone Canyon\r\n\r\n   This canyon is 100 feet deep, 2500 feet wide at the top, and\r\n   about 250 feet wide at the bottom. Neglecting any cutting of the\r\n   river against the banks, estimate what part of the excavation\r\n   of the canyon is due to the vertical erosion of its bed by the\r\n   river and what to weathering and rain wash on the canyon sides]\r\n\r\nIn the northern hemisphere the north sides of river valleys are\r\nsometimes of more gentle slope than the south sides. Can you suggest a\r\nreason?\r\n\r\n=The Grand Canyon of the Colorado River in Arizona.= The Colorado\r\nRiver trenches the high plateau of northern Arizona with a colossal\r\ncanyon two hundred and eighteen miles long and more than a mile in\r\ngreatest depth (Fig. 15). The rocks in which the canyon is cut are for\r\nthe most part flat-lying, massive beds of limestones and sandstones,\r\nwith some shales, beneath which in places harder crystalline rocks are\r\ndisclosed. Where the canyon is deepest its walls have been profoundly\r\ndissected. Lateral ravines have widened into immense amphitheaters,\r\nleaving between them long ridges of mountain height, buttressed\r\nand rebuttressed with flanking spurs and carved into majestic\r\narchitectural forms. From the extremity of one of these promontories\r\nit is two miles or more across the gulf to the point of the one\r\nopposite, and the heads of the amphitheaters are thirteen miles apart.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 54. Grand Canyon of the Colorado River,\r\n      Arizona]\r\n\r\nThe lower portion of the canyon is much narrower (Fig. 54) and its\r\nwalls of dark crystalline rock sink steeply to the edge of the river,\r\na swift, powerful stream a few hundred feet wide, turbid with reddish\r\nsilt, by means of which it continually rasps its rocky bed as it\r\nhurries on. The Colorado is still deepening its gorge. In the Grand\r\nCanyon its gradient is seven and one half feet to the mile, but, as in\r\nall ungraded rivers, the descent is far from uniform. Graded reaches\r\nin soft rock alternate with steeper declivities in hard rock, forming\r\nrapids such as, for example, a stretch of ten miles where the fall\r\naverages twenty-one feet to the mile. Because of these dangerous\r\nrapids the few exploring parties who have traversed the Colorado\r\ncanyon have done so at the hazard of their lives.\r\n\r\nThe canyon has been shaped by several agencies. Its depth is due to\r\nthe river which has sawed its way far toward the base of a lofty\r\nrising plateau. Acting alone this would have produced a slitlike gorge\r\nlittle wider than the breadth of the stream. The impressive width of\r\nthe canyon and the magnificent architectural masses which fill it are\r\nowing to two causes. Running water has gulched the walls and\r\nweathering has everywhere attacked and driven them back. The\r\nhorizontal harder beds stand out in long lines of vertical cliffs,\r\noften hundreds of feet in height, at whose feet talus slopes conceal\r\nthe outcrop of the weaker strata (Fig. 15). As the upper cliffs have\r\nbeen sapped and driven back by the weather, broad platforms are left\r\nat their bases and the sides of the canyon descend to the river by\r\ngigantic steps. Far up and down the canyon the eye traces these\r\nhorizontal layers, like the flutings of an elaborate molding,\r\ndistinguishing each by its contour as well as by its color and\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 55. Diagrams illustrating Conditions which\r\n      produce Falls or Rapids\r\n\r\n   _A_, vertical succession of harder and softer rocks;\r\n   _B_, horizontal succession of the same.

And yet the Colorado is a young stream and its work is no more\r\nthan well begun. It has not yet wholly reached grade, and the great\r\ntask of the river and its tributaries--the task of leveling the lofty\r\nplateau to a low plain and of transporting it grain by grain to the\r\nsea--still lies almost entirely in the future.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 56.

Under what conditions will\r\n   it migrate the least distance and soonest be destroyed?]\r\n\r\n=Waterfalls and rapids.= Before the bed of a stream is reduced to\r\ngrade it may be broken by abrupt descents which give rise to\r\nwaterfalls and rapids. Such breaks in a river's bed may belong to the\r\ninitial surface over which it began its course; still more commonly\r\nare they developed in the rock mass through which it is cutting its\r\nvalley. Thus, wherever a stream leaves harder rocks to flow over\r\nsofter ones the latter are quickly worn below the level of the former,\r\nand a sharp change in slope, with a waterfall or rapid, results.\r\n\r\nAt time of flood young tributaries with steeper courses than that of\r\nthe trunk stream may bring down stones and finer waste, which the\r\ngentler current cannot move along, and throw them as a dam across its\r\nway. The rapids thus formed are also ephemeral, for as the gradient of\r\nthe tributaries is lowered the main stream becomes able to handle the\r\nsmaller and finer load which they discharge.\r\n\r\nA rare class of falls is produced where the minor tributaries of a\r\nyoung river are not able to keep pace with their master stream in the\r\nerosion of their beds because of their smaller volume, and thus join\r\nit by plunging over the side of its gorge. But as the river approaches\r\ngrade and slackens its down cutting, the tributaries sooner or later\r\novertake it, and effacing their falls, unite with it on a level.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 58. Maturely Dissected Plateau near\r\n      Charleston, West Virginia\r\n\r\n   Compare the number of streams in any given number of square\r\n   miles with the number on an area of the same size in the Red\r\n   River Valley (Fig. 44). What is the shape of the ridges? Are\r\n   their summits broad or narrow? Are their crests even or broken\r\n   by knobs and cols (the depressions on the crest line)? If the\r\n   latter, how deeply have the cols been worn beneath the summits\r\n   of the knobs?]\r\n\r\nWaterfalls and rapids of all kinds are evanescent features of a\r\nriver's youth. Like lakes they are soon destroyed, and if any long\r\ntime had already elapsed since their formation they would have been\r\nobliterated already.\r\n\r\n=Local baselevels.= That balanced condition called grade, where a\r\nriver neither degrades its bed by erosion nor aggrades it by\r\ndeposition, is first attained along reaches of soft rocks, ungraded\r\noutcrops of hard rocks remaining as barriers which give rise to rapids\r\nor falls. Until these barriers are worn away they constitute local\r\nbaselevels, below which level the stream, up valley from them, cannot\r\ncut. They are eroded to grade one after another, beginning with the\r\nleast strong, or the one nearest the mouth of the stream. In a similar\r\nway the surface of a lake in a river's course constitutes for all\r\ninflowing streams a local baselevel, which disappears when the basin\r\nis filled or drained.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 59. A Maturity Dissected Region of Slight\r\n      Relief, Iowa]\r\n\r\n\r\nMature And Old Rivers\r\n\r\nMaturity is the stage of a river's complete development and most\r\neffective work. The river system now has well under way its great task\r\nof wearing down the land mass which it drains and carrying it particle\r\nby particle to the sea. The relief of the land is now at its greatest;\r\nfor the main channels have been sunk to grade, while the divides\r\nremain but little worn below their initial altitudes. Ground water now\r\nstands low. The run-off washes directly to the streams, with the least\r\ndelay and loss by evaporation in ponds and marches; the discharge of\r\nthe river is therefore at its height. The entire region is dissected\r\nby stream ways. The area of valley slopes is now largest and sheds to\r\nthe streams a heavier load of waste than ever before. At maturity the\r\nriver system is doing its greatest amount of work both in erosion and\r\nin the carriage of water and of waste to the sea.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 60. Successive Stages, _A_, _B_, _C_, and\r\n      _D_, in Valley-Widening by Planation\r\n\r\n   Describe valley _A_. What changes have taken place in _B_, _C_,\r\n   and _D_? Do the river bends remain stationary or move up or\r\n   down valley? With what effect on the projecting spurs of the\r\n   valley sides? Draw diagrams showing a still later stage than _D_]\r\n\r\n=Lateral erosion.= On reaching grade a river ceases to scour its bed,\r\nand it does not again begin to do so until some change in load or\r\nvolume enables it to find grade at a lower level. On the other hand, a\r\nstream erodes its banks at all stages in its history, and with graded\r\nrivers this process, called lateral erosion, or _planation_, is\r\nspecially important. The current of a stream follows the outer side of\r\nall curves or bends in the channel, and on this side it excavates its\r\nbed the deepest and continually wears and saps its banks. On the inner\r\nside deposition takes place in the more shallow and slower-moving\r\nwater. The inner bank of bends is thus built out while the outer bank\r\nis worn away. By swinging its curves against the valley sides a graded\r\nriver continually cuts a wider and wider floor. The V-valley of youth\r\nis thus changed by planation to a flat-floored valley with flaring\r\nsides which gradually become subdued by the weather to gentle slopes.\r\nWhile widening their valleys streams maintain a constant width of\r\nchannel, so that a wide-floored valley does not signify that it ever\r\nwas occupied by a river of equal width.\r\n\r\n=The gradient.= The gradients of graded rivers differ widely. A large\r\nriver with a light load reaches grade on a faint slope, while a\r\nsmaller stream heavily burdened with waste requires a steep slope to\r\ngive it velocity sufficient to move the load.\r\n\r\nThe Platte, a graded river of Nebraska with its headwaters in the\r\nRocky Mountains, is enfeebled by the semi-arid climate of the Great\r\nPlains and surcharged with the waste brought down both by its branches\r\nin the mountains and by those whose tracks lie over the soft rocks of\r\nthe plains. It is compelled to maintain a gradient of eight feet to\r\nthe mile in western Nebraska. The Ohio reaches grade with a slope of\r\nless than four inches to the mile from Cincinnati to its mouth, and\r\nthe powerful Mississippi washes along its load with a fall of but\r\nthree inches per mile from Cairo to the Gulf.\r\n\r\nOther things being equal, which of graded streams will have the\r\nsteeper gradient, a trunk stream or its tributaries? a stream supplied\r\nwith gravel or one with silt?\r\n\r\nOther factors remaining the same, what changes would occur if the\r\nPlatte should increase in volume? What changes would occur if the load\r\nshould be increased in amount or in coarseness?\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 61. Successive Cross Sections of a Region as\r\n      it advances from Infancy _a_, to Old Age _e_]\r\n\r\n_The old age of rivers._ As rivers pass their prime, as denudation\r\nlowers the relief of the region, less waste and finer is washed over\r\nthe gentler slopes of the lowering hills. With smaller loads to carry,\r\nthe rivers now deepen their valleys and find grade with fainter\r\ndeclivities nearer the level of the sea. This limit of the level of\r\nthe sea beneath which they cannot erode is known as _baselevel_.[1] As\r\nstreams grow old they approach more and more closely to baselevel,\r\nalthough they are never able to attain it. Some slight slope is needed\r\nthat water may flow and waste be transported over the land. Meanwhile\r\nthe relief of the land has ever lessened. The master streams and their\r\nmain tributaries now wander with sluggish currents over the broad\r\nvalley floors which they have planed away; while under the erosion of\r\ntheir innumerable branches and the wear of the weather the divides\r\neverywhere are lowered and subdued to more and more gentle slopes.\r\nMountains and high plateaus are thus reduced to rolling hills, and at\r\nlast to plains, surmounted only by such hills as may still be\r\nunreduced to the common level, because of the harder rocks of which\r\nthey are composed or because of their distance from the main erosion\r\nchannels. Such regions of faint relief, worn down to near base level\r\nby subaërial agencies, are known as _peneplains_ (almost plains).\r\nAny residual masses which rise above them are called _monadnocks_,\r\nfrom the name of a conical peak of New Hampshire which overlooks the\r\nnow uplifted peneplain of southern New England.\r\n\r\n   [1] The term \"baselevel\" is also used to designate the close\r\n       approximation to sea level to which streams are able to\r\n       subdue the land.\r\n\r\nIn its old age a region becomes mantled with thick sheets of fine and\r\nweathered waste, slowly moving over the faint slopes toward the water\r\nways and unbroken by ledges of bare rock. In other words, the waste\r\nmantle also is now graded, and as waterfalls have been effaced in the\r\nriver beds, so now any ledges in the wide streams of waste are worn\r\naway and covered beneath smooth slopes of fine soil. Ground water\r\nstands high and may exude in areas of swamp. In youth the land mass\r\nwas roughhewn and cut deep by stream erosion. In old age the faint\r\nreliefs of the land dissolve away, chiefly under the action of the\r\nweather, beneath their cloak of waste.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 62. Peneplain surrounded by Monadnocks,\r\n      Piedmont Belt, Virginia\r\n\r\n   From Davis' _Elementary Physical Geography]\r\n\r\n=The cycle of erosion.= The successive stages through which a land\r\nmass passes while it is being leveled to the sea constitute together a\r\ncycle of erosion. Each stage of the cycle from infancy to old age\r\nleaves, as we have seen, its characteristic records in the forms\r\nsculptured on the land, such as the shapes of valleys and the contours\r\nof hills and plains. The geologist is thus able to determine by the\r\nland forms of any region the stage in the erosion cycle to which it\r\nnow belongs, and knowing what are the earlier stages of the cycle, to\r\nread something of the geological history of the region.\r\n\r\n=Interrupted cycles.= So long a time is needed to reduce a land mass\r\nto baselevel that the process is seldom if ever completed during a\r\nsingle uninterrupted cycle of erosion. Of all the various\r\ninterruptions which may occur the most important are gradual movements\r\nof the earth's crust, by which a region is either depressed or\r\nelevated relative to sea level.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 63. Young Inner Gorge in Wide Older Valley,\r\n      Alaska]\r\n\r\nThe _depression_ of a region hastens its old age by decreasing the\r\ngradient of streams, by destroying their power to excavate their beds\r\nand carry their loads to a degree corresponding to the amount of the\r\ndepression, and by lessening the amount of work they have to do. The\r\nslackened river currents deposit their waste in Hood plains which\r\nincrease in height as the subsidence continues. The lower courses of\r\nthe rivers are invaded by the sea and become estuaries, while the\r\nlower tributaries are cut off from the trunk stream.\r\n\r\n_Elevation_, on the other hand, increases the activity of all agencies\r\nof weathering, erosion, and transportation, restores the region to its\r\nyouth, and inaugurates a new cycle of erosion. Streams are given a\r\nsteeper gradient, greater velocity, and increased energy to carry\r\ntheir loads and wear their beds. They cut through the alluvium of\r\ntheir flood plains, leaving it on either bank as successive terraces,\r\nand intrench themselves in the underlying rock. In their older and\r\nwider valleys they cut narrow, steep-walled inner gorges, in which\r\nthey flow swiftly over rocky floors, broken here and there by falls\r\nand rapids where a harder layer of rock has been discovered. Winding\r\nstreams on plains may thus incise their meanders in solid rock as the\r\nplains are gradually uplifted. Streams which are thus restored to\r\ntheir youth are said to be _revived_.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 64. Incised Meanders of Oneota River, Iowa]\r\n\r\nAs streams cut deeper and the valley slopes are steepened, the mantle\r\nof waste of the region undergoing elevation is set in more rapid\r\nmovement. It is now removed particle by particle faster than it forms.\r\nAs the waste mantle thins, weathering attacks the rocks of the region\r\nmore energetically until an equilibrium is reached again; the rocks\r\nwaste rapidly and their waste is as rapidly removed.\r\n\r\n=Dissected peneplains.= When a rise of the land brings one cycle to an\r\nend and begins another, the characteristic land forms of each cycle\r\nare found together and the topography of the region is composite until\r\nthe second cycle is so far advanced that the land forms of the first\r\ncycle are entirely destroyed. The contrast between the land surfaces\r\nof the later and the earlier cycles is most striking when the earlier\r\nhad advanced to age and the later is still in youth. Thus many\r\npeneplains which have been elevated and dissected have been recognized\r\nby the remnants of their ancient erosion surfaces, and the length of\r\ntime which has elapsed since their uplift has been measured by the\r\nstage to which the new cycle has advanced.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 65.\r\n\r\n   Describe the valley of stream _a_. Is it young or old? How does\r\n   the valley of _b_ differ from that of _a_? Compare as to form\r\n   and age the inner valley of _b_ with the outer valley and with\r\n   the valley of _a_. Account for the inner valley. Why does it\r\n   not extend to the upper portion of the course of _b_? Will it\r\n   ever do so? Draw longitudinal profile of _b_, showing the\r\n   different gradient of upper and lower portions of its course\r\n   not here seen. As the inner valley of tributary _c_ extends\r\n   headward it may invade the valley of _a_ before the inner\r\n   valley of _a_ has worked upstream to the area seen in the\r\n   diagram. With what results?]\r\n\r\n=The Piedmont Belt.= As an example of an ancient peneplain uplifted\r\nand dissected we may cite the Piedmont Belt, a broad upland lying\r\nbetween the Appalachian Mountains and the Atlantic coastal plain. The\r\nsurface of the Piedmont is gently rolling. The divides, which are\r\noften smooth areas of considerable width, rise to a common plane, and\r\nfrom them one sees in every direction an even sky line except where in\r\nplaces some lone hill or ridge may lift itself above the general level\r\n(Fig. 62). The surface is an ancient one, for the mantle of residual\r\nwaste lies deep upon it, soils are reddened by long oxidation, and the\r\nrocks are rotted to a depth of scores of feet.\r\n\r\nAt present, however, the waste mantle is not forming so rapidly as it\r\nis being removed. The streams of the upland are actively engaged in\r\nits destruction. They flow swiftly in narrow, rock-walled valleys over\r\nrocky beds. This contrast between the young streams and the aged\r\nsurface which they are now so vigorously dissecting can only be\r\nexplained by the theory that the region once stood lower than at\r\npresent and has recently been upraised. If now we imagine the valleys\r\nrefilled with the waste which the streams have swept away, and the\r\nupland lowered, we restore the Piedmont region to the condition in\r\nwhich it stood before its uplift and dissection,--a gently rolling\r\nplain, surmounted here and there by isolated hills and ridges.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 66. Dissected Peneplain of Southern New\r\n      England]\r\n\r\nThe surface of the ancient Piedmont plain, as it may be restored from\r\nthe remnants of it found on the divides, is not in accordance with the\r\nstructures of the country rocks. Where these are exposed to view they\r\nare seen to be far from horizontal. On the walls of river gorges they\r\ndip steeply and in various directions and the streams flow over their\r\nupturned edges. As shown in Figure 67, the rocks of the Piedmont have\r\nbeen folded and broken and tilted.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 67. Section in Piedmont Belt\r\n      _M_, a monadnock]\r\n\r\nIt is not reasonable to believe that when the rocks of the Piedmont\r\nwere thus folded and otherwise deformed the surface of the region was\r\na plain. The upturned layers have not always stopped abruptly at the\r\neven surface of the Piedmont plain which now cuts across them. They\r\nare the bases of great folds and tilted blocks which must once have\r\nrisen high in air. The complex and disorderly structures of the\r\nPiedmont rocks are those seen in great mountain ranges, and there is\r\nevery reason to believe that these rocks after their deformation rose\r\nto mountain height.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 68. The area of the Laurentian Peneplain\r\n      (shaded)]\r\n\r\nThe ancient Piedmont plain cuts across these upturned rocks as\r\nindependently of their structure as the even surface of the sawed\r\nstump of some great tree is independent of the direction of its\r\nfibers. Hence the Piedmont plain as it was before its uplift was not a\r\ncoastal plain formed of strata spread in horizontal sheets beneath the\r\nsea and then uplifted; nor was it a structural plain, due to the\r\nresistance to erosion of some hard, flat-lying layer of rock. Even\r\nsurfaces developed on rocks of discordant structure, such as the\r\nPiedmont shows, are produced by long denudation, and we may consider\r\nthe Piedmont as a peneplain formed by the wearing down of mountain\r\nranges, and recently uplifted.\r\n\r\n=The Laurentian peneplain.= This is the name given to a denuded\r\nsurface on very ancient rocks which extends from the Arctic Ocean to\r\nthe St. Lawrence River and Lake Superior, with small areas also in\r\nnorthern Wisconsin and New York. Throughout this U-shaped area, which\r\nincloses Hudson Bay within its arms, the country rocks have the\r\ncomplicated and contorted structures which characterize mountain\r\nranges (see Fig. 179, P. 211). But the surface of the area is by no\r\nmeans mountainous. The sky line when viewed from the divides is\r\nunbroken by mountain peaks or rugged hills. The surface of the arm\r\nwest of Hudson Bay is gently undulating and that of the eastern arm\r\nhas been roughened to low-rolling hills and dissected in places by\r\nsuch deep river gorges as those of the Ottawa and Saguenay. This\r\nimmense area may be regarded as an ancient peneplain truncating the\r\nbases of long-vanished mountains and dissected after elevation.\r\n\r\nIn the examples cited the uplift has been a broad one and to\r\ncomparatively little height. Where peneplains have been uplifted to\r\ngreat height and have since been well dissected, and where they have\r\nbeen upfolded and broken and uptilted, their recognition becomes more\r\ndifficult. Yet recent observers have found evidences of ancient\r\nlowland surfaces of erosion on the summits of the Allegheny ridges,\r\nthe Cascade Mountains (Fig. 69), and the western slope of the Sierra\r\nNevadas.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 69. View in the Cascade Mountains, Washington\r\n\r\n   The general level to which these ridges rise may be accounted\r\n   for by the uplift and dissection of a once low-lying peneplain]\r\n\r\n=The southern Appalachian region.= We have here an example of an area\r\nthe latter part of whose geological history may be deciphered by means\r\nof its land forms. The generalized section of Figure 70, which passes\r\nfrom west to east across a portion of the region in eastern Tennessee,\r\nshows on the west a part of the broad Cumberland plateau. On the east\r\nis a roughened upland platform, from which rise in the distance the\r\npeaks of the Great Smoky Mountains. The plateau, consisting of strata\r\nbut little changed from their original flat-lying attitude, and the\r\nplatform, developed on rocks of disordered structure made crystalline\r\nby heat and pressure, both stand at the common level of the line AB.\r\nThey are separated by the Appalachian valley, forty miles wide, cut in\r\nstrata which have been folded and broken into long narrow blocks. The\r\nvalley is traversed lengthwise by long, low ridges, the outcropping\r\nedges of the harder strata, which rise to about the same level,--that\r\nof the line _cd_. Between these ridges stretch valley lowlands at the\r\nlevel _ef_ excavated in the weaker rocks, while somewhat below them lie\r\nthe channels of the present streams now busily engaged in deepening\r\ntheir beds.\r\n\r\n_The valley lowlands._ Were they planed by graded or ungraded streams?\r\nHave the present streams reached grade? Why did the streams cease\r\nwidening the floors of the valley lowlands? How long since? When will\r\nthey begin anew the work of lateral planation? What effect will this\r\nhave on the ridges if the present cycle of erosion continues long\r\nuninterrupted?\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 70. Generalized Section of the Southern\r\n      Appalachian Region in Eastern Tennessee]\r\n\r\n_The ridges of the Appalachian valley._ Why do they stand above the\r\nvalley lowlands? Why do their summits lie in about the same plane?\r\nRefilling the valleys intervening between these ridges with the\r\nmaterial removed by the streams, what is the nature of the surface\r\nthus restored? Does this surface _cd_ accord with the rock structures\r\non which it has been developed? How may it have been made? At what\r\nheight did the land stand then, compared with its present height? What\r\nelevations stood above the surface _cd_? Why? What name may you use to\r\ndesignate them? How does the length of time needed to develop the\r\nsurface _cd_ compare with that needed to develop the valley lowlands?\r\n\r\n_The Platform And Plateau._ Why do they stand at a common level ab? Of\r\nwhat surface may they be remnants? Is it accordant with the rock\r\nstructure? How was it produced?

Compare the time needed\r\nto develop this surface with that needed to develop _cd_. Which surface\r\nis the older?\r\n\r\nHow many cycles of erosion are represented here? Give the erosion\r\nhistory of the region by cycles, beginning with the oldest, the work\r\ndone in each and the work left undone, what brought each cycle to a\r\nclose, and how long relatively it continued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nRIVER DEPOSITS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe characteristic features of river deposits and the forms which they\r\nassume may be treated under three heads: (1) valley deposits, (2)\r\nbasin deposits, and (3) deltas.\r\n\r\n\r\nValley Deposits\r\n\r\n=Flood plains.= The deposits which streams build along their courses\r\nat times of flood are known as flood plains. A swift current then\r\nsweeps along the channel, while a shallow sheet of water moves slowly\r\nover the flood plain, spreading upon it a thin layer of sediment. It\r\nhas been estimated that each inundation of the Nile leaves a layer of\r\nfertilizing silt three hundredths of an inch thick over the flood\r\nplain of Egypt.\r\n\r\nFlood plains may consist of a thin spread of alluvium over the flat\r\nrock floor of a valley which is being widened by the lateral erosion\r\nof a graded stream (Fig. 60). Flood-plain deposits of great thickness\r\nmay be built by aggrading rivers even in valleys whose rock floors\r\nhave never been thus widened (Fig. 368).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 71. Cross Section of a Flood Plain]\r\n\r\nA cross section of a flood plain (Fig. 71) shows that it is highest\r\nnext the river, sloping gradually thence to the valley sides. These\r\nwide natural embankments are due to the fact that the river deposit is\r\nheavier near the bank, where the velocity of the silt-laden channel\r\ncurrent is first checked by contact with the slower-moving overflow.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 72. Waste-filled Valley and Braided\r\n     Channels of the Upper Mississippi]\r\n\r\nThus banked off from the stream, the outer portions of a flood plain\r\nare often ill-drained and swampy, and here vegetal deposits, such as\r\npeat, may be interbedded with river silts.\r\n\r\nA map of a wide flood plain, such as that of the Mississippi or the\r\nMissouri (Fig. 77), shows that the courses of the tributaries on\r\nentering it are deflected downstream. Why?\r\n\r\nThe aggrading streams by which flood plains are constructed gradually\r\nbuild their immediate banks and beds to higher and higher levels, and\r\ntherefore find it easy at times of great floods to break their natural\r\nembankments and take new courses over the plain. In this way they\r\naggrade each portion of it in turn by means of their shifting\r\nchannels.\r\n\r\n=Braided channels.= A river actively engaged in aggrading its valley\r\nwith coarse waste builds a flood plain of comparatively steep gradient\r\nand often flows down it in a fairly direct course and through a\r\nnetwork of braided channels. From time to time a channel becomes\r\nchoked with waste, and the water no longer finding room in it breaks\r\nout and cuts and builds itself a new way which reunites down valley\r\nwith the other channels. Thus there becomes established a network of\r\never-changing channels inclosing low islands of sand and gravel.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 73. Terraced Valley of River in Central Asia]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 74. Terraces carved in Alluvial Deposits]\r\n\r\n   Which is older, the rock floor of the valley or the river\r\n   deposits which fill it? What are the relative ages of terraces\r\n   _a_, _b_, _c_, and _e_? It will be noted that the remnants of\r\n   the higher flood plains have not been swept away by the\r\n   meandering river, as it swung from side to side of the valley\r\n   at lower levels, because they have been defended by ledges of\r\n   hard rock in the projecting spurs of the initial valley. The\r\n   stream has encountered such defending ledges at the point\r\n   marked _d_]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 75. River Terraces of Rock covered with\r\n      Alluvium\r\n\r\n   _c_, recent flood plain of the river. To what processes is it\r\n   due? Account for the alluvium at _a_ and _b_ and on the\r\n   opposite side of the valley at the same levels. Which is the\r\n   older? Account for the flat rock floors on which these deposits\r\n   of alluvium rest. Give the entire history which may be read in\r\n   the section]\r\n\r\n=Terraces.= While aggrading streams thus tend to shift their channels,\r\ndegrading streams, on the contrary, become more and more deeply\r\nintrenched in their valleys. It often occurs that a stream, after\r\nhaving built a flood plain, ceases to aggrade its bed because of a\r\nlessened load or for other reasons, such as an uplift of the region,\r\nand begins instead to degrade it. It leaves the original flood plain\r\nout of reach of even the highest floods. When again it reaches grade\r\nat a lower level it produces a new flood plain by lateral erosion in\r\nthe older deposits, remnants of which stand as terraces on one or both\r\nsides of the valley. In this way a valley may be lined with a\r\nsuccession of terraces at different levels, each level representing an\r\nabandoned flood plain.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 76. Development of a Meander\r\n\r\n   The dotted line in _a_, _b_, and _c_ shows the stage preceding   that indicate by the unbroken line]\r\n\r\n=Meanders.= Valleys aggraded with fine waste form well-nigh level\r\nplains over which streams wind from side to side of a direct course in\r\nsymmetric bends known as meanders, from the name of a winding river of\r\nAsia Minor. The giant Mississippi has developed meanders with a radius\r\nof one and one half miles, but a little creek may display on its\r\nmeadow as perfect curves only a rod or so in radius. On the flood\r\nplain of either river or creek we may find examples of the successive\r\nstages in the development of the meander, from its beginning in the\r\nslight initial bend sufficient to deflect the current against the\r\nouter side. Eroding here and depositing on the inner side of the bend,\r\nit gradually reaches first the open bend (Fig. 76, _a_) whose width\r\nand length are not far from equal, and later that of the horseshoe\r\nmeander (Fig. 76, _b_) whose diameter transverse to the course of the\r\nstream is much greater than that parallel with it. Little by little\r\nthe neck of land projecting into the bend is narrowed, until at last\r\nit is cut through and a \"cut-off\" is established. The old channel is\r\nnow silted up at both ends and becomes a crescentic lagoon (Fig. 76,\r\n_c_), or oxbow lake, which fills gradually to an arc-shaped shallow\r\ndepression.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 77. Map of a portion of the Flood Plain of\r\n        the Missouri River\r\n\r\n   Each small square represents one square mile. How wide is the\r\n   flood plain of the Missouri? How wide is the flood plain of the\r\n   Big Sioux? Why is the latter river deflected down valley on\r\n   entering the flood plain of the master stream? How do the\r\n   meanders of the two rivers compare in size? How does the width\r\n   of each flood plain compare with the width of the belt occupied\r\n   by the meanders of the river? Do you find traces of any former\r\n   channels?]\r\n\r\n=Flood plains characteristic of mature rivers.= On reaching grade a\r\nstream planes a flat floor for its continually widening valley. Ever\r\ncutting on the outer bank of its curves, it deposits on the inner bank\r\nscroll-like flood-plain patches (Fig 60). For a while the valley bluffs\r\ndo not give its growing meanders room to develop to their normal size,\r\nbut as planation goes on, the bluffs are driven back to the full width\r\nof the meander belt and still later to a width which gives room for\r\nbroad stretches of flood plain on either side (Fig. 77).\r\n\r\nUsually a river first attains grade near its mouth, and here first sinks\r\nits bed to near baselevel. Extending its graded course upstream by\r\ncutting away barrier after barrier, it comes to have a widened and\r\nmature valley over its lower course, while its young headwaters are\r\nstill busily eroding their beds. Its ungraded branches may thus bring\r\ndown to its lower course more waste than it is competent to carry on to\r\nthe sea, and here it aggrades its bed and builds a flood plain in order\r\nto gain a steeper gradient and velocity enough to transport its load.\r\n\r\nAs maturity is past and the relief of the land is lessened, a smaller\r\nand smaller load of waste is delivered to the river. It now has energy\r\nto spare and again degrades its valley, excavating its former flood\r\nplains and leaving them in terraces on either side, and at last in its\r\nold age sweeping them away.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 78. Alluvial Cones, Wyoming]\r\n\r\n=Alluvial cones and fans.= In hilly and mountainous countries one often\r\nsees on a valley side a conical or fan-shaped deposit of waste at the\r\nmouth of a lateral stream. The cause is obvious: the young branch has\r\nnot been able as yet to wear its bed to accordant level with the already\r\ndeepened valley of the master stream. It therefore builds its bed to\r\ngrade at the point of juncture by depositing here its load of waste,--a\r\nload too heavy to be carried along the more gentle profile of the trunk\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 79. Tributaries and Distributaries of a\r\n      Fan-Building Stream]\r\n\r\nWhere rivers descend from a mountainous region upon the plain they may\r\nbuild alluvial fans of exceedingly gentle slope. Thus the rivers of\r\nthe western side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains have spread fans with\r\na radius of as much as forty miles and a slope too slight to be\r\ndetected without instruments, where they leave the rock-cut canyons in\r\nthe mountains and descend upon the broad central valley of California.\r\n\r\nAs a river flows over its fan it commonly divides into a branchwork of\r\nshifting channels called _distributaries_, since they lead off the\r\nwater from the main stream. In this way each part of the fan is\r\naggraded and its symmetric form is preserved.\r\n\r\n=Piedmont plains.= Mountain streams may build their confluent fans\r\ninto widespread piedmont (foot of the mountain) alluvial plains. These\r\nare especially characteristic of arid lands, where the streams wither\r\nas they flow out upon the thirsty lowlands and are therefore compelled\r\nto lay down a large portion of their load. In humid climates\r\nmountain-born streams are usually competent to carry their loads of\r\nwaste on to the sea, and have energy to spare to cut the lower\r\nmountain slopes into foothills. In arid regions foothills are commonly\r\nabsent and the ranges rise, as from pedestals, above broad, sloping\r\nplains of stream-laid waste.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 80. Section from the Rocky Mountains Eastward\r\n      River deposits dotted]\r\n\r\n=The High Plains.= The rivers which flow eastward from the Rocky\r\nMountains have united their fans in a continuous sheet of waste which\r\nstretches forward from the base of the mountains for hundreds of miles\r\nand in places is five hundred feet thick (Fig. 80). That the deposit\r\nwas made in ancient times on land and not in the sea is proved by the\r\nremains which it contains of land animals and plants of species now\r\nextinct. That it was laid by rivers and not by fresh-water lakes is\r\nshown by its structure. Wide stretches of flat-lying, clays and sands\r\nare interrupted by long, narrow belts of gravel which mark the\r\nchannels of the ancient streams. Gravels, and sands are often cross\r\nbedded, and their well worn pebbles may be identified with the rocks\r\nof the mountains. After building this sheet of waste the streams\r\nceased to aggrade and began the work of destruction. Large uneroded\r\nremnants, their surfaces flat as a floor, remain as the High Plains of\r\nwestern Kansas and Nebraska.\r\n\r\n=River deposits in subsiding troughs.= To a geologist the most\r\nimportant river deposits are those which gather in areas of gradual\r\nsubsidence; they are often of vast extent and immense thickness, and\r\nsuch deposits of past geological ages have not infrequently been\r\npreserved, with all their records of the times in which they were\r\nbuilt, by being carried below the level of the sea, to be brought to\r\nlight by a later uplift. On the other hand, river deposits which\r\nremain above baselevels of erosion are swept away comparatively soon.\r\n\r\n=The Great Valley Of California= is a monotonously level plain of\r\ngreat fertility, four hundred miles in length and fifty miles in\r\naverage width, built of waste swept down by streams from the mountain\r\nranges which inclose it,--the Sierra Nevada on the east and the Coast\r\nRange on the west. On the waste slopes at the foot of the bordering\r\nhills coarse gravels and even bowlders are left, while over the\r\ninterior the slow-flowing streams at times of flood spread wide sheets\r\nof silt. Organic deposits are now forming by the decay of vegetation\r\nin swampy tule (reed) lands and in shallow lakes which occupy\r\ndepressions left by the aggrading streams.\r\n\r\nDeep borings show that this great trough is filled to a depth of at\r\nleast two thousand feet below sea level with recent unconsolidated\r\nsands and silts containing logs of wood and fresh-water shells. These\r\nare land deposits, and the absence of any marine deposits among them\r\nproves that the region has not been invaded by the sea since the\r\naccumulation began. It has therefore been slowly subsiding and its\r\nstreams, although continually carried below grade, have yet been able\r\nto aggrade the surface as rapidly as the region sank, and have\r\nmaintained it, as at present, slightly above sea level.\r\n\r\n=The Indo-Gangetic Plain=, spread by the Brahmaputra, the Ganges, and\r\nthe Indus river systems, stretches for sixteen hundred miles along the\r\nsouthern base of the Himalaya Mountains and occupies an area of three\r\nhundred thousand square miles (Fig. 342). It consists of the flood\r\nplains of the master streams and the confluent fans of the tributaries\r\nwhich issue from the mountains on the north. Large areas are subject\r\nto overflow each season of flood, and still larger tracts mark\r\nabandoned flood plains below which the rivers have now cut their beds.\r\nThe plain is built of far-stretching beds of clay, penetrated by\r\nstreaks of sand, and also of gravel near the mountains. Beds of impure\r\npeat occur in it, and it contains fresh-water shells and the bones of\r\nland animals of species now living in northern India. At Lucknow an\r\nartesian well was sunk to one thousand feet below sea level without\r\nreaching the bottom of these river-laid sands and silts, proving a\r\nslow subsidence with which the aggrading rivers have kept pace.\r\n\r\n=Warped valleys.= It is not necessary that an area should sink below\r\nsea level in order to be filled with stream-swept waste. High valleys\r\namong growing mountain ranges may suffer warping, or may be blockaded\r\nby rising mountain folds athwart them. Where the deformation is rapid\r\nenough, the river may be ponded and the valley filled with lake-laid\r\nsediments. Even when the river is able to maintain its right of way it\r\nmay yet have its declivity so lessened that it is compelled to aggrade\r\nits course continually, filling the valley with river deposits which\r\nmay grow to an enormous thickness.\r\n\r\nBehind the outer ranges of the Himalaya Mountains lie several\r\nwaste-filled valleys, the largest of which are Kashmir and Nepal, the\r\nformer being an alluvial plain about as large as the state of\r\nDelaware. The rivers which drain these plains have already cut down\r\ntheir outlet gorges sufficiently to begin the task of the removal of\r\nthe broad accumulations which they have brought in from the\r\nsurrounding mountains. Their present flood plains lie as much as some\r\nhundreds of feet below wide alluvial terraces which mark their former\r\nlevels. Indeed, the horizontal beds of the Hundes Valley have been\r\ntrenched to the depth of nearly three thousand feet by the Sutlej\r\nRiver. These deposits are recent or subrecent, for there have been\r\nfound at various levels the remains of land plants and land and\r\nfresh-water shells, and in some the bones of such animals as the hyena\r\nand the goat, of species or of genera now living. Such soft deposits\r\ncannot be expected to endure through any considerable length of future\r\ntime the rapid erosion to which their great height above the level of\r\nthe sea will subject them.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 81. Cross Section of Aggraded Valley,\r\n      showing Structure of River Deposits]\r\n\r\n=Characteristics of river deposits.= The examples just cited teach\r\nclearly the characteristic features of extensive river deposits. These\r\ndeposits consist of broad, flat-lying sheets of clay and fine sand\r\nleft by the overflow at time of flood, and traversed here and there by\r\nlong, narrow strips of coarse, cross-bedded sands and gravels thrown\r\ndown by the swifter currents of the shifting channels. Occasional beds\r\nof muck mark the sites of shallow lakelets or fresh-water swamps. The\r\nvarious strata also contain some remains of the countless myriads of\r\nanimals and plants which live upon the surface of the plain as it is\r\nin process of building. River shells such as the mussel, land shells\r\nsuch as those of snails, the bones of fishes and of such land animals\r\nas suffer drowning at times of flood or are mired in swampy places,\r\nlogs of wood, and the stems and leaves of plants are examples of the\r\nvariety of the remains of land and fresh-water organisms which are\r\nentombed in river deposits and sealed away as a record of the life of\r\nthe time, and as proof that the deposits were laid by streams and not\r\nbeneath the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasin Deposits\r\n\r\n=Deposits in dry basins.= On desert areas without outlet to the sea,\r\nas on the Great Basin of the United States and the deserts of central\r\nAsia, stream-swept waste accumulates indefinitely. The rivers of the\r\nsurrounding mountains, fed by the rains and melting snows of these\r\ncomparatively moist elevations, dry and soak away as they come down\r\nupon the arid plains. They are compelled to lay aside their entire\r\nload of waste eroded from the mountain valleys, in fans which grow to\r\nenormous size, reaching in some instances thousands of feet in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\nThe monotonous levels of Turkestan include vast alluvial tracts now in\r\nprocess of building by the floods of the frequently shifting channels\r\nof the Oxus and other rivers of the region. For about seven hundred\r\nmiles from its mouth in Aral Lake the Oxus receives no tributaries,\r\nsince even the larger branches of its system are lost in a network of\r\ndistributaries and choked with desert sands before they reach their\r\nmaster stream. These aggrading rivers, which have channels but no\r\nvalleys, spread their muddy floods--which in the case of the Oxus\r\nsometimes equal the average volume of the Mississippi--far and wide\r\nover the plain, washing the bases of the desert dunes.\r\n\r\n=Playas.= In arid interior basins the central depressions may be\r\noccupied by playas,--plains of fine mud washed forward from the\r\nmargins. In the wet season the playa is covered with a thin sheet of\r\nmuddy water, a playa lake, supplied usually by some stream at flood.\r\nIn the dry season the lake evaporates, the river which fed it\r\nretreats, and there is left to view a hard, smooth, level floor of\r\nsun-baked and sun-cracked yellow clay utterly devoid of vegetation.\r\n\r\nIn the Black Rock desert of Nevada a playa lake spreads over an area\r\nfifty miles long and twenty miles wide. In summer it disappears; the\r\nQuinn River, which feeds it, shrinks back one hundred miles toward its\r\nsource, leaving an absolutely barren floor of clay, level as the sea.\r\n\r\n=Lake deposits.= Regarding lakes as parts of river systems, we may now\r\nnotice the characteristic features of the deposits in lake basins.\r\nSoundings in lakes of considerable size and depth show that their\r\nbottoms are being covered with tine clays. Sand and gravel are found\r\nalong; their margins, being brought in by streams and worn by waves\r\nfrom the shore, but there are no tidal or other strong currents to\r\nsweep coarse waste out from shore to any considerable distance. Where\r\nfine clays are now found on the land in even, horizontal layers\r\ncontaining the remains of fresh-water animals and plants, uncut by\r\nchannels tilled with cross-bedded gravels and sands and bordered by\r\nbeach deposits of coarse waste, we may safely infer the existence of\r\nancient lakes.\r\n\r\n=Marl.= Marl is a soft, whitish deposit of carbonate of lime, mingled\r\noften with more or less of clay, accumulated in small lakes whose\r\nfeeding springs are charged with carbonate of lime and into which\r\nlittle waste is washed from the land. Such lakelets are not infrequent\r\non the surface of the younger drift sheets of Michigan and northern\r\nIndiana, where their beds of marl--sometimes as much as forty feet\r\nthick--are utilized in the manufacture of Portland cement. The deposit\r\nresults from the decay of certain aquatic plants which secrete lime\r\ncarbonate from the water, from the decomposition of the calcareous\r\nshells of tiny mollusks which live in countless numbers on the lake\r\nfloor, and in some cases apparently from chemical precipitation.\r\n\r\n=Peat.= We have seen how lakelets are extinguished by the decaying\r\nremains of the vegetation which they support. A section of such a\r\nfossil lake shows that below the growing mosses and other plants of\r\nthe surface of the bog lies a spongy mass composed of dead vegetable\r\ntissue, which passes downward gradually into _peat_,--a dense, dark\r\nbrown carbonaceous deposit in which, to the unaided eye, little or no\r\ntrace of vegetable structure remains. When dried, peat forms a fuel of\r\nsome value and is used either cut into slabs and dried or pressed into\r\nbricks by machinery.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 82. Digging Peat, Scotland]\r\n\r\nWhen vegetation decays in open air the carbon of its tissues, taken\r\nfrom the atmosphere by the leaves, is oxidized and returned to it in\r\nits original form of carbon dioxide. But decomposing in the presence\r\nof water, as in a bog, where the oxygen of the air is excluded, the\r\ncarbonaceous matter of plants accumulates in deposits of peat.\r\n\r\nPeat bogs are numerous in regions lately abandoned by glacier ice,\r\nwhere river systems are so immature that the initial depressions left\r\nin the sheet of drift spread over the country have not yet been\r\ndrained. One tenth of the surface of Ireland is said to be covered\r\nwith peat, and small bogs abound in the drift-covered area of New\r\nEngland and the states lying as far west as the Missouri River. In\r\nMassachusetts alone it has been reckoned that there are fifteen\r\nbillion cubic feet of peat, the largest bog occupying several thousand\r\nacres.\r\n\r\nMuch larger swamps occur on the young coastal plain of the Atlantic\r\nfrom New Jersey to Florida. The Dismal Swamp, for example, in Virginia\r\nand North Carolina is forty miles across. It is covered with a dense\r\ngrowth of water-loving trees such as the cypress and black gum. The\r\ncenter of the swamp is occupied by Lake Drummond, a shallow lake seven\r\nmiles in diameter, with banks of pure-peat, and still narrowing from\r\nthe encroachment of vegetation along its borders.\r\n\r\n=Salt lakes.= In arid climates a lake rarely receives sufficient\r\ninflow to enable it to rise to the basin rim and find an outlet.\r\nBefore this height is reached its surface becomes large enough to\r\ndischarge by evaporation into the dry air the amount of water that is\r\nsupplied by streams. As such a lake has no outlet, the minerals in\r\nsolution brought into it by its streams cannot escape from the basin.\r\nThe lake water becomes more and more heavily charged with such\r\nsubstances as common salt and the sulphates and carbonates of lime, of\r\nsoda, and of potash, and these are thrown down from solution one after\r\nanother as the point of saturation for each mineral is reached.\r\nCarbonate of lime, the least soluble and often the most abundant\r\nmineral brought in, is the first to be precipitated. As concentration\r\ngoes on, gypsum, which is insoluble in a strong brine, is deposited,\r\nand afterwards common salt. As the saltness of the lake varies with\r\nthe seasons and with climatic changes, gypsum and salt are laid in\r\nalternate beds and are interleaved with sedimentary clays spread from\r\nthe waste brought in by streams at times of flood. Few forms of life\r\ncan live in bodies of salt water so concentrated that chemical\r\ndeposits take place, and hence the beds of salt, gypsum, and silt of\r\nsuch lakes are quite barren of the remains of life. Similar deposits\r\nare precipitated by the concentration of sea water in lagoons and arms\r\nof the sea cut off from the ocean.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 83. Map of Lake Bonneville and Lahontan\r\n\r\n   From Davis' _Physical Geography_]\r\n\r\n=Lakes Bonneville and Lahontan.= These names are given to extinct\r\nlakes which once occupied large areas in the Great Basin, the former\r\nin Utah, the latter in northwestern Nevada. Their records remain in\r\nold horizontal beach lines which they drew along their mountainous\r\nshores at the different levels at which they stood, and in the\r\ndeposits of their beds. At its highest stage Lake Bonneville, then one\r\nthousand feet deep, overflowed to the north and was a fresh-water\r\nlake. As it shrank below the outlet it became more and more salty, and\r\nthe Great Salt Lake, its withered residue, is now depositing salt\r\nalong its shores. In its strong brine lime carbonate is insoluble, and\r\nthat brought in by streams is thrown down at once in the form of\r\ntravertine.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 84. Section of Deposits in Beds of Lakes\r\n      Bonneville and Lahontan]\r\n\r\nLake Lahontan never had an outlet. The first chemical deposits to be\r\nmade along its shores were deposits of travertine, in places eighty\r\nfeet thick. Its floor is spread with fine clays, which must have been\r\nlaid in deep, still water, and which are charged with the salts\r\nabsorbed by them as the briny water of the lake dried away. These\r\nsedimentary clays are in two divisions, the upper and lower, each\r\nbeing about one hundred feet thick (_a_ and _c_, Fig. 84). They are\r\nseparated by heavy deposits of well-rounded, cross-bedded gravels and\r\nsands (_b_, Fig. 84), similar to those spread at the present time by\r\nthe intermittent streams of arid regions. A similar record is shown in\r\nthe old floors of Lake Bonneville. What conclusions do you draw from\r\nthese facts as to the history of these ancient lakes?\r\n\r\n\r\nDeltas\r\n\r\nIn the river deposits which are left above sea level particles of\r\nwaste are allowed to linger only for a time. From alluvial fans and\r\nflood plains they are constantly being taken up and swept farther on\r\ndownstream. Although these land forms may long persist, the particles\r\nwhich compose them are ever changing. We may therefore think of the\r\nalluvial deposits of a valley as a stream of waste fed by the waste\r\nmantle as it creeps and washes down the valley sides, and slowly\r\nmoving onwards to the sea.\r\n\r\nIn basins waste finds a longer rest, but sooner or later lakes and dry\r\nbasins are drained or filled, and their deposits, if above sea level,\r\nresume their journey to their final goal. It is only when carried\r\nbelow the level of the sea that they are indefinitely preserved.\r\n\r\nOn reaching this terminus, rivers deliver their load to the ocean. In\r\nsome cases the ocean is able to take it up by means of strong tidal\r\nand other currents, and to dispose of it in ways which we shall study\r\nlater. But often the load is so large, or the tides are so weak, that\r\nmuch of the waste which the river brings in settles at its mouth,\r\nthere building up a deposit called the _delta_, from the Greek letter\r\n(D) of that name, whose shape it sometimes resembles.\r\n\r\nDeltas and alluvial fans have many common characteristics. Both owe\r\ntheir origin to a sudden check in the velocity of the river,\r\ncompelling a deposit of the load; both are triangular in outline, the\r\napex pointing upstream; and both are traversed by distributaries which\r\nbuild up all parts in turn.\r\n\r\nIn a delta we may distinguish deposits of two distinct kinds,--the\r\nsubmarine and the subaërial. In part a delta is built of waste\r\nbrought down by the river and redistributed and spread by waves and\r\ntides over the sea bottom adjacent to the river's mouth. The origin of\r\nthese deposits is recorded in the remains of marine animals and plants\r\nwhich they contain.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 85. Delta of the Mississippi River]\r\n\r\nAs the submarine delta grows near to the level of the sea the\r\ndistributaries of the river cover it with subaërial deposits\r\naltogether similar to those of the flood plain, of which indeed the\r\nsubaërial delta is the prolongation. Here extended deposits of peat\r\nmay accumulate in swamps, and the remains of land and fresh-water\r\nanimals and plants swept down by the stream are imbedded in the silts\r\nlaid at times of flood.\r\n\r\nBorings made in the deltas of great rivers such as the Mississippi,\r\nthe Ganges, and the Nile, show that the subaërial portion often\r\nreaches a surprising thickness. Layers of peat, old soils, and forest\r\ngrounds with the stumps of trees are discovered hundreds of feet below\r\nsea level. In the Nile delta some eight layers of coarse gravel were\r\nfound interbedded with river silts, and in the Ganges delta at\r\nCalcutta a boring nearly five hundred feet in depth stopped in such a\r\nlayer.\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi has built a delta of twelve thousand three hundred\r\nsquare miles, and is pushing the natural embankments of its chief\r\ndistributaries into the Gulf at a maximum rate of a mile in sixteen\r\nyears. Muddy shoals surround its front, shallow lakes, e.g. lakes\r\nPontchartrain and Borgne, are formed between the growing delta and the\r\nold shore line, and elongate lakes and swamps are inclosed between the\r\nnatural embankments of the distributaries.\r\n\r\nThe delta of the Indus River, India, lies so low along shore that a\r\nbroad tract of country is overflowed by the highest tides. The\r\nsubmarine portion of the delta has been built to near sea level over\r\nso wide a belt offshore that in many places large vessels cannot come\r\neven within sight of land because of the shallow water.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 86. Radial Section of a Delta\r\n\r\n   This section of a delta illustrates the structure of the\r\n   platform which swift streams well loaded with coarse waste\r\n   build in the water bodies into which they empty. Three members\r\n   may be distinguished: the _bottom set beds_, _a_: the _fore set\r\n   beds_, _b_; and the _top set beds_, _c_. Account for the slope\r\n   of each of these. Why are the bottom set beds of the finer\r\n   material and why do they extend beyond the others? How does the\r\n   profile of this delta differ from that of an alluvial cone and\r\n   why?]\r\n\r\nA former arm of the sea, the Rann of Cutch, adjoining the delta on the\r\neast has been silted up and is now an immense barren flat of sandy mud\r\ntwo hundred miles in length and one hundred miles in greatest breadth.\r\nEach summer it is flooded with salt water when the sea is brought in\r\nby strong southwesterly monsoon winds, and the climate during the\r\nremainder of the year is hot and dry. By the evaporation of sea water\r\nthe soil is thus left so salty that no vegetation can grow upon it,\r\nand in places beds of salt several feet in thickness have accumulated.\r\nUnder like conditions salt beds of great thickness have been formed in\r\nthe past and are now found buried among the deposits of ancient\r\ndeltas.\r\n\r\n=Subsidence of great deltas.= As a rule great deltas are slowly\r\nsinking. In some instances upbuilding by river deposits has gone on as\r\nrapidly as the region has subsided. The entire thickness of the Ganges\r\ndelta, for example, so far as it has been sounded, consists of\r\ndeposits laid in open air. In other cases interbedded limestones and\r\nother sedimentary rocks containing marine fossils prove that at times\r\nsubsidence has gained on the upbuilding and the delta has been covered\r\nwith the sea.\r\n\r\nIt is by gradual depression that delta deposits attain enormous\r\nthickness, and, being lowered beneath the level of the sea, are safely\r\npreserved from erosion until a movement of the earth's crust in the\r\nopposite direction lifts them to form part of the land. We shall read\r\nlater in the hard rocks of our continent the records of such ancient\r\ndeltas, and we shall not be surprised to find them as thick as are\r\nthose now building at the mouths of great rivers.\r\n\r\n=Lake deltas.= Deltas are also formed where streams lose their\r\nvelocity on entering the still waters of lakes. The shore lines of\r\nextinct lakes, such as Lake Agassiz and Lakes Bonneville and Lahontan,\r\nmay be traced by the heavy deposits at the mouths of their tributary\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the work of streams is to drain the lands of the\r\nwater poured upon them by the rainfall, to wear them down, and to\r\ncarry their waste away to the sea, there to be rebuilt by other agents\r\ninto sedimentary rocks. The ancient strata of which the continents are\r\nlargely made are composed chiefly of material thus worn from still\r\nmore ancient lands--lands with their hills and valleys like those of\r\nto-day--and carried by their rivers to the ocean. In all geological\r\ntimes, as at the present, the work of streams has been to destroy the\r\nlands, and in so doing to furnish to the ocean the materials from\r\nwhich the lands of future ages were to be made. Before we consider how\r\nthe waste of the land brought in by streams is rebuilt upon the ocean\r\nfloor, we must proceed to study the work of two agents, glacier ice\r\nand the wind, which coöperate with rivers in the denudation of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 87. Section of Undifferentiated Drift near\r\n      Chicago]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE WORK OF GLACIERS\r\n\r\n\r\n=The drift.= The surface of northeastern North America, as far south\r\nas the Ohio and Missouri rivers, is generally covered by the drift,--a\r\nformation which is quite unlike any which we have so far studied. A\r\nsection of it, such as that illustrated in Figure 87, shows that for\r\nthe most part it is unstratified, consisting of clay, sand, pebbles,\r\nand even large bowlders, all mingled pell-mell together. The agent\r\nwhich laid the drift is one which can carry a load of material of all\r\nsizes, from the largest bowlder to the finest clay, and deposit it\r\nwithout sorting.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 88. Characteristic Pebbles from the Drift\r\n\r\n   No. 1 has six facets; No. 4, originally a rounded river\r\n   pebble, has been nibbled down to one flat face; Nos. 3\r\n   and 5 are battered subangular fragments on one side only]\r\n\r\nThe stones of the drift are of many kinds. The region from which it\r\nwas gathered may well have been large in order to supply these many\r\ndifferent varieties of rocks. Pebbles and bowlders have been left far\r\nfrom their original homes, as may be seen in southern Iowa, where the\r\ndrift contains nuggets of copper brought from the region about Lake\r\nSuperior. The agent which laid the drift is one able to gather its\r\nload over a large area and carry it a long way.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 89. Smoothed and Scored Rock Surface exposed\r\n      to View by the Removal of Overlying Drift, Iowa]\r\n\r\nThe pebbles of the drift are unlike those rounded by running water or\r\nby waves. They are marked with scratches. Some are angular, many have\r\nhad their edges blunted, while others have been ground flat and smooth\r\non one or more sides, like gems which have been faceted by being held\r\nfirmly against the lapidary's wheel (Fig. 88). In many places the\r\nupper surface of the country rock beneath the drift has been swept\r\nclean of residual clays and other waste. All rock rotten has been\r\nplaned away, and the ledges of sound rock to which the surface has\r\nbeen cut down have been rubbed smooth and scratched with long,\r\nstraight, parallel lines (Fig. 89). The agent which laid the drift can\r\nhold sand and pebbles firmly in its grasp and can grind them against\r\nthe rock beneath, thus planing it down and scoring it, while faceting\r\nthe pebbles also.\r\n\r\nNeither water nor wind can do these things. Indeed, nothing like the\r\ndrift is being formed by any process now at work anywhere in the\r\neastern United States. To find the agent which has laid this extensive\r\nformation we must go to a region of different climatic conditions.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 90. Map of Greenland\r\n\r\n   Glacier ice covers all but the areas shaded]\r\n\r\n=The inland ice of Greenland.= Greenland is about fifteen hundred\r\nmiles long and nearly seven hundred miles in greatest width. With the\r\nexception of a narrow fringe of mountainous coast land, it is\r\ncompletely buried beneath a sheet of ice, in shape like a vast white\r\nshield, whose convex surface rises to a height of nine thousand feet\r\nabove the sea. The few explorers who have crossed the ice cap found it\r\na trackless desert destitute of all life save such lowly forms as the\r\nmicroscopic plant which produces the so-called \"red snow.\" On the\r\nsmooth plain of the interior no rock waste relieves the snow's\r\ndazzling whiteness; no streams of running water are seen; the silence\r\nis broken only by howling storm winds and the rustle of the surface\r\nsnow which they drive before them. Sounding with long poles, explorers\r\nfind that below the powdery snow of the latest snowfall lie successive\r\nlayers of earlier snows, which grow more and more compact downward,\r\nand at last have altered to impenetrable ice. The ice cap formed by\r\nthe accumulated snows of uncounted centuries may well be more than a\r\nmile in depth. Ice thus formed by the compacting of snow is\r\ndistinguished when in motion as _glacier ice_.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 91. Hypothetical Cross Section of Greenland]\r\n\r\nThe inland ice of Greenland moves. It flows with imperceptible\r\nslowness under its own weight, like, a mass of some viscous or plastic\r\nsubstance, such as pitch or molasses candy, in all directions outward\r\ntoward the sea. Near the edge it has so thinned that mountain peaks\r\nare laid bare, these islands in the sea of ice being known as\r\n_nunataks_. Down the valleys of the coastal belt it drains in separate\r\nstreams of ice, or _glaciers_. The largest of these reach the sea at\r\nthe head of inlets, and are therefore called _tide glaciers_. Their\r\nfronts stand so deep in sea water that there is visible seldom more\r\nthan three hundred feet of the wall of ice, which in many glaciers\r\nmust be two thousand and more feet high. From the sea walls of tide\r\nglaciers great fragments break off and float away as icebergs. Thus\r\nsnows which fell in the interior of this northern land, perhaps many\r\nthousands of years ago, are carried in the form of icebergs to melt at\r\nlast in the North Atlantic.\r\n\r\nGreenland, then, is being modeled over the vast extent of its interior\r\nnot by streams of running water, as are regions in warm and humid\r\nclimates, nor by currents of air, as are deserts to a large extent,\r\nbut by a sheet of flowing ice. What the ice sheet is doing in the\r\ninterior we may infer from a study of the separate glaciers into which\r\nit breaks at its edge.\r\n\r\n=The smaller Greenland glaciers.= Many of the smaller glaciers of\r\nGreenland do not reach the sea, but deploy on plains of sand and\r\ngravel. The edges of these ice tongues are often as abrupt as if\r\nsliced away with a knife (Fig. 92), and their structure is thus\r\nreadily seen. They are stratified, their layers representing in part\r\nthe successive snowfalls of the interior of the country. The upper\r\nlayers are commonly white and free from stones; but the lower layers,\r\nto the height of a hundred feet or more, are dark with debris which is\r\nbeing slowly carried on. So thickly studded with stones is the base of\r\nthe ice that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish it from the rock\r\nwaste which has been slowly dragged beneath the glacier or left about\r\nits edges. The waste beneath and about the glacier is unsorted. The\r\nstones are of many kinds, and numbers of them have been ground to flat\r\nfaces. Where the front of the ice has retreated the rock surface is\r\nseen to be planed and scored in places by the stones frozen fast in\r\nthe sole of the glacier.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 92. A Greenland Glacier]\r\n\r\nWe have now found in glacier ice an agent able to produce the drift of\r\nNorth America. The ice sheet of Greenland is now doing what we have\r\nseen was done in the recent past in our own land. It is carrying for\r\nlong distances rocks of many kinds gathered, we may infer, over a\r\nlarge extent of country. It is laying down its load without assortment\r\nin unstratified deposits. It grinds down and scores the rock over\r\nwhich it moves, and in the process many of the pebbles of its load are\r\nthemselves also ground smooth and scratched. Since this work can be\r\ndone by no other agent, we must conclude that the northeastern part of\r\nour own continent was covered in the recent past by glacier ice, as\r\nGreenland is to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nValley Glaciers\r\n\r\nThe work of glacier ice can be most conveniently studied in the\r\nseparate ice streams which creep down mountain valleys in many regions\r\nsuch as Alaska, the western mountains of the United States and Canada,\r\nthe Himalayas, and the Alps. As the glaciers of the Alps have been\r\nstudied longer and more thoroughly than any others, we shall describe\r\nthem in some detail as examples of valley glaciers in all parts of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n=Conditions of glacier formation.= The condition of the great\r\naccumulation of snow to which glaciers are due--that more or less of\r\neach winter's snow should be left over unmelted and unevaporated to\r\nthe next--is fully met in the Alps. There is abundant moisture brought\r\nby the winds from neighboring seas. The currents of moist air driven\r\nup the mountain slopes are cooled by their own expansion as they rise,\r\nand the moisture which they contain is condensed at a temperature at\r\nor below 32° F., and therefore is precipitated in the form of snow.\r\nThe summers are cool and their heat does not suffice to completely\r\nmelt the heavy snow of the preceding winter. On the Alps the _snow\r\nline_--the lower limit of permanent snow--is drawn at about eight\r\nthousand five hundred feet above sea level. Above the snow line on the\r\nslopes and crests, where these are not too steep, the snow lies the\r\nyear round and gathers in valley heads to a depth of hundreds of feet.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 93. Glaciers heading in Snow-filled\r\n      Amphitheaters, the Alps]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 94. Bergschrund of a Glacier in Colorado]\r\n\r\nThis is but a small fraction of the thickness to which snow would be\r\npiled on the Alps were it not constantly being drained away. Below the\r\nsnow fields which mantle the heights the mountain valleys are occupied\r\nby glaciers which extend as much as a vertical mile below the snow\r\nline. The presence in the midst of forests and meadows and cultivated\r\nfields of these tongues of ice, ever melting and yet from year to year\r\nlosing none of their bulk, proves that their loss is made good in the\r\nonly possible way. They are fed by snow fields above, whose surplus of\r\nsnow they drain away in the form of ice. The presence of glaciers\r\nbelow the snow line is a clear proof that, rigid and motionless as\r\nthey appear, glaciers really are in constant motion down valley.\r\n\r\n=The névé field.= The head of an Alpine valley occupied by a glacier\r\nis commonly a broad amphitheater deeply filled with snow (Fig. 93).\r\nGreat peaks tower above it, and snowy slopes rise on either side on\r\nthe flanks of mountain spurs. From these heights fierce winds drift\r\nthe snows into the amphitheater, and avalanches pour in their torrents\r\nof snow and waste. The snow of the amphitheater is like that of drifts\r\nin late winter after many successive thaws and freezings. It is made\r\nof hard grains and pellets and is called _névé_. Beneath the surface\r\nof the névé field and at its outlet the granular névé has been\r\ncompacted to a mass of porous crystalline ice. Snow has been changed\r\nto névé, and névé to glacial ice, both by pressure, which drives the\r\nair from the interspaces of the snowflakes, and also by successive\r\nmeltings and freezings, much as a snowball is packed in the warm hand\r\nand becomes frozen to a ball of ice.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 95. Sea Wall of the Muir Glacier, Alaska]\r\n\r\n=The bergschrund.= The névé is in slow motion. It breaks itself loose\r\nfrom the thinner snows about it, too shallow to share its motion, and\r\nfrom the rock rim which surrounds it, forming a deep fissure called\r\nthe bergschrund, sometimes a score and more feet wide (Fig. 94).\r\n\r\n=Size of glaciers.= The ice streams of the Alps vary in size according\r\nto the amount of precipitation and the area of the névé fields which\r\nthey drain. The largest of Alpine glaciers, the Aletsch, is nearly ten\r\nmiles long and has an average width of about a mile. The thickness of\r\nsome of the glaciers of the Alps is as much as a thousand feet. Giant\r\nglaciers more than twice the length of the longest in the Alps occur\r\non the south slope of the Himalaya Mountains, which receive frequent\r\nprecipitations of snow from moist winds from the Indian Ocean. The\r\nbest known of the many immense glaciers of Alaska, the Muir, has an\r\narea of about eight hundred square miles (Fig. 95).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 96. Diagram showing Movement of Row of\r\n\r\n   Stakes _a_, set in a direct line across the surface of a glacier;\r\n   _b_, _c_, and _d_, successive later positions of the stakes]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 97. Diagram showing Movement of Vertical\r\n      Row of Stakes _a_, set on side of glacier]\r\n\r\n=Glacier motion.= The motion of the glaciers of the Alps seldom\r\nexceeds one or two feet a day. Large glaciers, because of the enormous\r\npressure of their weight and because of less marginal resistance, move\r\nfaster than small ones. The Muir advances at the rate of seven feet a\r\nday, and some of the larger tide glaciers of Greenland are reported to\r\nmove at the exceptional rate of fifty feet and more in the same time.\r\nGlaciers move faster by day than by night, and in summer than in\r\nwinter. Other laws of glacier motion may be discovered by a study of\r\nFigures 96 and 97. It is important to remember that glaciers do not\r\nslide bodily over their beds, but urged by gravity move slowly down\r\nvalley in somewhat the same way as would a stream of thick mud.\r\nAlthough small pieces of ice are brittle, the large mass of granular\r\nice which composes a glacier acts as a viscous substance.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 98. Crevasses of a Glacier, Canada]\r\n\r\n=Crevasses.= Slight changes of slope in the glacier bed, and the\r\ndifferent rates of motion in different parts, produce tensions under\r\nwhich the ice cracks and opens in great fissures called crevasses. At\r\nan abrupt descent in the bed the ice is shattered into great\r\nfragments, which unite again below the icefall. Crevasses are opened\r\non lines at right angles to the direction of the tension. _Transverse\r\ncrevasses_ are due to a convexity in the bed which stretches the ice\r\nlengthwise (Fig. 99). _Marginal crevasses_ are directed upstream and\r\ninwards; _radial crevasses_ are found where the ice stream deploys\r\nfrom some narrow valley and spreads upon some more open space. What is\r\nthe direction of the tension which causes each and to what is it due?\r\n(Figs. 100 and 101).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 99. Longitudinal Section of a Portion of a\r\n      Glacier, showing Traverse Crevasses]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 100. Map view of Marginal Crevasses]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 101. The Rhone Glacier, showing Radial\r\n      Crevasses, the Alps]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 102. Map View of the Junction of Two\r\n      Branches of a Glacier\r\n\r\n   The moraines are represented by broken lines]\r\n\r\n=Lateral and medial moraines.= The surface of a glacier is striped\r\nlengthwise by long dark bands of rock debris. Those in the center are\r\ncalled the medial moraines. The one on either margin is a lateral\r\nmoraine, and is clearly formed of waste which has fallen on the edge\r\nof the ice from the valley slopes. A medial moraine cannot be formed\r\nin this way, since no rock fragments can fall so far out from the\r\nsides. But following it up the glacial stream, one finds that a medial\r\nmoraine takes its beginning at the junction of the glacier and some\r\ntributary and is formed by the union of their two adjacent lateral\r\nmoraines (Fig. 102). Each branch thus adds a medial moraine, and by\r\ncounting the number of medial moraines of a trunk stream one may learn\r\nof how many branches it is composed.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 103. Cross Section of a Glacier showing\r\n      Lateral Moraines\r\n\r\n   _l_, _l_, and Medial Moraines _m_, _m_]\r\n\r\nSurface moraines appear in the lower course of the glacier as ridges,\r\nwhich may reach the exceptional height of one hundred feet. The bulk\r\nof such a ridge is ice. It has been protected from the sun by the\r\nveneer of moraine stuff; while the glacier surface on either side has\r\nmelted down at least the distance of the height of the ridge. In\r\nsummer the lowering of the glacial surface by melting goes on rapidly.\r\nIn Swiss glaciers it has been estimated that the average lowering of\r\nthe surface by melting and evaporation amounts to ten feet a year. As\r\na moraine ridge grows higher and more steep by the lowering of the\r\nsurface of the surrounding ice, the stones of its cover tend to slip\r\ndown its sides. Thus moraines broaden, until near the terminus of a\r\nglacier they may coalesce in a wide field of stony waste.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 104. Glacier with Medial Moraines, the Alps\r\n\r\n   Is the ice moving from or towards the observer?]\r\n\r\n=Englacial drift.= This name is applied to whatever debris is carried\r\nwithin the glacier. It consists of rock waste fallen on the névé and\r\nthere buried by accumulations of snow, and of that engulfed in the\r\nglacier where crevasses have opened beneath a surface moraine. As the\r\nsurface of the glacier is lowered by melting, more or less englacial\r\ndrift is brought again to open air, and near the terminus it may help\r\nto bury the ice from view beneath a sheet of debris.\r\n\r\n=The ground moraine.= The drift dragged along at the glacier's base\r\nand lodged beneath it is known as the ground moraine. Part of the\r\nmaterial of it has fallen down deep crevasses and part has been torn\r\nand worn from the glacier's bed and banks. While the stones of the\r\nsurface moraines remain as angular as when they lodged on the ice,\r\nmany of those of the ground moraine have been blunted on the edges and\r\nfaceted and scratched by being ground against one another and the\r\nrocky bed.\r\n\r\nIn glaciers such as those of Greenland, whose basal layers are well\r\nloaded with drift and whose surface layers are nearly clean, different\r\nlayers have different rates of motion, according to the amount of\r\ndrift with which they are clogged. One layer glides over another, and\r\nthe stones inset in each are ground and smoothed and scratched.\r\nUsually the sides of glaciated pebbles are more worn than the ends,\r\nand the scratches upon them run with the longer axis of the stone.\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\n=The terminal moraine.= As a glacier is in constant motion, it brings\r\nto its end all of its load except such parts of the ground moraine as\r\nmay find permanent lodgment beneath the ice. Where the glacier front\r\nremains for some time at one place, there is formed an accumulation of\r\ndrift known as the terminal moraine. In valley glaciers it is shaped\r\nby the ice front to a crescent whose convex side is downstream. Some\r\nof the pebbles of the terminal moraine are angular, and some are\r\nfaceted and scored, the latter having come by the hard road of the\r\nground moraine. The material of the dump is for the most part\r\nunsorted, though the water of the melting ice may find opportunity to\r\nleave patches of stratified sands and gravels in the midst of the\r\nunstratified mass of drift, and the finer material is in places washed\r\naway.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 105. Terminal Moraine of a Glacier in Montana\r\n\r\n   The ice has melted back from the morainic ridge on the left and\r\n   is building another on the right. The hollow between the ridges\r\n   is occupied by a lakelet.]\r\n\r\n=Glacier drainage.= The terminal moraine is commonly breached by a\r\nconsiderable stream, which issues from beneath the ice by a tunnel\r\nwhose portal has been enlarged to a beautiful archway by melting\r\nin the sun and the warm air (Fig. 107). The stream is gray with\r\nsilt and loaded with sand and gravel washed from the ground\r\nmoraine. \"Glacier milk\" the Swiss call this muddy water, the gray\r\ncolor of whose silt proves it rock flour freshly ground by the ice\r\nfrom the unoxidized sound rock of its bed, the mud of streams\r\nbeing yellowish when it is washed from the oxidized mantle of\r\nwaste. Since glacial streams are well loaded with waste due to\r\nvigorous ice erosion, the valley in front of the glacier is\r\ncommonly aggraded to a broad, flat floor. These outwash deposits\r\nare known as _valley drift_.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 106. Heavy Moraine about the Terminus of a\r\n      Glacier in the Rocky Mountains of Canada\r\n\r\n   Account for the fact that the morainic ridge rises considerably\r\n   above the surface of the ice]\r\n\r\nThe sand brought out by streams from beneath a glacier differs from\r\nriver sand in that it consists of freshly broken angular grains. Why?\r\n\r\nThe stream derives its water chiefly from the surface melting of the\r\nglacier. As the ice is touched by the rays of the morning sun in\r\nsummer, water gathers in pools, and rills trickle and unite in\r\nbrooklets which melt and cut shallow channels in the blue ice. The\r\ncourse of these streams is short. Soon they plunge into deep wells cut\r\nby their whirling waters where some crevasse has begun to open across\r\ntheir path. These wells lead into chambers and tunnels by which sooner\r\nor later their waters find way to the rock floor of the valley and\r\nthere unite in a subglacial stream.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 107. Subglacial Stream Issuing from Tunnel\r\n      in the Ice, Norway]\r\n\r\n=The lower limit of glaciers.= The glaciers of a region do not by any\r\nmeans end at a uniform height above sea level. Each terminates where\r\nits supply is balanced by melting. Those therefore which are fed by\r\nthe largest and deepest névés and those also which are best protected\r\nfrom the sun by a northward exposure or by the depth of their\r\ninclosing valleys flow to lower levels than those whose supply is less\r\nand whose exposure to the sun is greater.\r\n\r\nA series of cold, moist years, with an abundant snowfall, causes\r\nglaciers to thicken and advance; a series of warm, dry years causes\r\nthem to wither and melt back. The variation in glaciers is now\r\ncarefully observed in many parts of the world. The Muir glacier has\r\nretreated two miles in twenty years. The glaciers of the Swiss Alps\r\nare now for the most part melting back, although a well-known glacier\r\nof the eastern Alps, the Vernagt, advanced five hundred feet in the\r\nyear 1900, and was then plowing up its terminal moraine.\r\n\r\nHow soon would you expect a glacier to advance after its névé fields\r\nhave been swollen with unusually heavy snows, as compared with the\r\ntime needed for the flood of a large river to reach its mouth after\r\nheavy rains upon its headwaters?\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 108. A Glacier Table]\r\n\r\nOn the surface of glaciers in summer time one may often see large\r\nstones supported by pillars of ice several feet in height (Fig. 108).\r\nThese \"glacier tables\" commonly slope more or less strongly to the\r\nsouth, and thus may be used to indicate roughly the points of the\r\ncompass. Can you explain their formation and the direction of their\r\nslope? On the other hand, a small and thin stone, or a patch of dust,\r\nlying on the ice, tends to sink a few inches into it. Why?\r\n\r\nIn what respects is a valley glacier like a mountain stream which\r\nflows out upon desert plains?\r\n\r\nTwo confluent glaciers do not mingle their currents as do two\r\nconfluent rivers. What characteristics of surface moraines prove this\r\nfact?\r\n\r\nWhat effect would you expect the laws of glacier motion to have on the\r\nslant of the sides of transverse crevasses?\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 109. Map of Malaspina Glacier, Alaska]\r\n\r\nA trunk glacier has four medial moraines. Of how many tributaries is\r\nit composed? Illustrate by diagram.\r\n\r\nState all the evidences which you have found that glaciers move.\r\n\r\nIf a glacier melts back with occasional pauses up a valley, what\r\nrecords are left of its retreat?\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 110. Outwash Plain, the Delta of the Yahtse\r\n      River, Alaska]\r\n\r\n\r\nPiedmont Glaciers\r\n\r\n=The Malaspina glacier.= Piedmont (foot of the mountain) glaciers are,\r\nas the name implies, ice fields formed at the foot of mountains by the\r\nconfluence of valley glaciers. The Malaspina glacier of Alaska, the\r\ntypical glacier of this kind, is seventy miles wide and stretches for\r\nthirty miles from the foot of the Mount Saint Elias range to the shore\r\nof the Pacific Ocean. The valley glaciers which unite and spread to\r\nform this lake of ice lie above the snow line and their moraines are\r\nconcealed beneath névé. The central area of the Malaspina is also\r\nfree from debris; but on the outer edge large quantities of englacial\r\ndrift are exposed by surface melting and form a belt of morainic waste\r\na few feet thick and several miles wide, covered in part with a\r\nluxuriant forest, beneath which the ice is in places one thousand feet\r\nin depth. The glacier here is practically stagnant, and lakes a few\r\nhundred yards across, which could not exist were the ice in motion and\r\nbroken with crevasses, gather on their beds sorted waste from the\r\nmoraine. The streams which drain the glacier have cut their courses in\r\nenglacial and subglacial tunnels; none flow for any distance on the\r\nsurface. The largest, the Yahtse River, issues from a high archway in\r\nthe ice,--a muddy torrent one hundred feet wide and twenty feet deep,\r\nloaded with sand and stones which it deposits in a broad outwash plain\r\n(Fig. 110). Where the ice has retreated from the sea there is left a\r\nhummocky drift sheet with hollows filled with lakelets. These deposits\r\nhelp to explain similar hummocky regions of drift and similar plains\r\nof coarse, water-laid material often found in the drift-covered area\r\nof the northeastern United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Geological Work Of Glacier Ice\r\n\r\nThe sluggish glacier must do its work in a different way from the\r\nagile river. The mountain stream is swift and small, and its channel\r\noccupies but a small portion of the valley. The glacier is slow and\r\nbig; its rate of motion may be less than a millionth of that of\r\nrunning water over the same declivity, and its bulk is proportionately\r\nlarge and fills the valley to great depth. Moreover, glacier ice is a\r\nsolid body plastic under slowly applied stresses, while the water of\r\nrivers is a nimble fluid.\r\n\r\n=Transportation.= Valley glaciers differ from rivers as carriers in\r\nthat they float the major part of their load upon their surface,\r\ntransporting the heaviest bowlder as easily as a grain of sand; while\r\nstreams push and roll much of their load along their beds, and their\r\npower of transporting waste depends solely upon their velocity. The\r\namount of the surface load of glaciers is limited only by the amount\r\nof waste received from the mountain slopes above them. The moving\r\nfloor of ice stretched high across a valley sweeps along as lateral\r\nmoraines much of the waste which a mountain stream would let\r\naccumulate in talus and alluvial cones.\r\n\r\nWhile a valley glacier carries much of its load on top, an ice sheet,\r\nsuch as that of Greenland, is free from surface debris, except where\r\nmoraines trail away from some nunatak. If at its edge it breaks into\r\nseparate glaciers which drain down mountain valleys, these tongues of\r\nice will carry the selvages of waste common to valley glaciers. Both\r\nice sheets and valley glaciers drag on large quantities of rock waste\r\nin their ground moraines.\r\n\r\nStones transported by glaciers are sometimes called erratics. Such are\r\nthe bowlders of the drift of our northern states. Erratics may be set\r\ndown in an insecure position on the melting of the ice.\r\n\r\n=Deposit.= Little need be added here to what has already been said of\r\nground and terminal moraines. All strictly glacial deposits are\r\nunstratified. The load laid down at the end of a glacier in the\r\nterminal moraine is loose in texture, while the drift lodged beneath\r\nthe glacier as ground moraine is often an extremely dense, stony clay,\r\nhaving been compacted under the pressure of the overriding ice.\r\n\r\n=Erosion.= A glacier erodes its bed and banks in two ways,--by\r\nabrasion and by plucking.\r\n\r\nThe rock bed over which a glacier has moved is seen in places to have\r\nbeen abraded, or ground away, to smooth surfaces which are marked by\r\nlong, straight, parallel scorings aligned with the line of movement of\r\nthe ice and varying in size from hair lines and coarse scratches to\r\nexceptional furrows several feet deep. Clearly this work has been\r\naccomplished by means of the sharp sand, the pebbles, and the larger\r\nstones with which the base of the glacier is inset, and which it holds\r\nin a firm grasp as running water cannot. Hard and fine-grained rocks,\r\nsuch as granite and quartzite, are often not only ground down to a\r\nsmooth surface but are also highly polished by means of fine rock\r\nflour worn from the glacier bed.\r\n\r\nIn other places the bed of the glacier is rough and torn. The rocks\r\nhave been disrupted and their fragments have been carried away,--a\r\nprocess known as _plucking_. Moving under immense pressure the ice\r\nshatters the rock, breaks off projections, presses into crevices and\r\nwedges the rocks apart, dislodges the blocks into which the rock is\r\ndivided by joints and bedding planes, and freezing fast to the\r\nfragments drags them on. In this work the freezing and thawing of\r\nsubglacial waters in any cracks and crevices of the rock no doubt play\r\nan important part. Plucking occurs especially where the bed rock is\r\nweak because of close jointing. The product of plucking is bowlders,\r\nwhile the product of abrasion is fine rock flour and sand.\r\n\r\nIs the ground moraine of Figure 87 due chiefly to abrasion or to\r\nplucking?\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 111. Roches Moutonnés, Bronx Park, New York]\r\n\r\n=Roches moutonnées and rounded hills.= The prominences left between\r\nthe hollows due to plucking are commonly ground down and rounded on\r\nthe stoss side,--the side from which the ice advances,--and sometimes\r\non the opposite, the lee side, as well. In this way the bed rock often\r\ncomes to have a billowy surface known as roches moutonnées (sheep\r\nrocks). Hills overridden by an ice sheet often have similarly rounded\r\ncontours on the stoss side, while on the lee side they may be craggy,\r\neither because of plucking or because here they have been less worn\r\nfrom their initial profile (Fig. 112).\r\n\r\n=The direction of glacier movement.= The direction of the flow of\r\nvanished glaciers and ice sheets is recorded both in the differences\r\njust mentioned in the profiles of overridden hills and also in the\r\nminute details of the glacier trail.\r\n\r\nFlint nodules or other small prominences in the bed rock are found\r\nmore worn on the stoss than on the lee side, where indeed they may\r\nhave a low cone of rock protected by them from abrasion. Cavities, on\r\nthe other hand, have their edges worn on the lee side and left sharp\r\nupon the stoss.\r\n\r\nSurfaces worn and torn in the ways which we have mentioned are said to\r\nbe glaciated. But it must not be supposed that a glacier everywhere\r\nglaciates its bed. Although in places it acts as a rasp or as a pick,\r\nin others, and especially where its pressure is least, as near the\r\nterminus, it moves over its bed in the manner of a sled. Instances are\r\nknown where glaciers have advanced over deposits of sand and gravel\r\nwithout disturbing them to any notable degree. Like a river, a glacier\r\ndoes not everywhere erode. In places it leaves its bed undisturbed and\r\nin places aggrades it by deposits of the ground moraine.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 112. A Glaciated Hill, Norway. Sharp\r\n      Weathered Mountain Peaks in the Distance]\r\n\r\n=Cirques.= Valley glaciers commonly head as we have seen, in broad\r\namphitheaters deeply filled with snow and ice. On mountains now\r\ndestitute of glaciers, but whose glaciation shows that they have\r\nsupported glaciers in the past, there are found similar crescentic\r\nhollows with high, precipitous walls and glaciated floors. Their\r\nfloors are often basined and hold lakelets whose deep and quiet waters\r\nreflect the sheltering ramparts of rugged rock which tower far above\r\nthem. Such mountain hollows are termed _cirques_. As a powerful spring\r\nwears back a recess in the valley side where it discharges, so the\r\nfountain head of a glacier gradually wears back a cirque. In its slow\r\nmovement the névé field broadly scours its bed to a flat or basined\r\nfloor. Meanwhile the sides of the valley head are steepened and driven\r\nback to precipitous walls. For in winter the crevasse of the\r\nbergschrund which surrounds the névé field is filled with snow and the\r\nnévé is frozen fast to the rocky sides of the valley. In early summer\r\nthe névé tears itself free, dislodging and removing any loosened\r\nblocks, and the open fissure of the bergschrund allows frost and other\r\nagencies of weathering to attack the unprotected rock. As cirques are\r\nthus formed and enlarged the peaks beneath which they lie are\r\nsharpened, and the mountain crests are scalloped and cut back from\r\neither side to knife-edged ridges (Figs. 113 and 93).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 113. Cirques, Sierra Nevada Mountains]\r\n\r\nIn the western mountains of the United States many cirques, now empty\r\nof névé and glacier ice, and known locally as \"basins,\" testify to the\r\nfact that in recent times the snow line stood beneath the levels of\r\ntheir floors, and thus far below its present altitude.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 114. A Glacier Trough, Montana]\r\n\r\n=Glacier troughs.= The channel worn to accommodate the big and clumsy\r\nglacier differs markedly from the river valley cut as with a saw by\r\nthe narrow and flexible stream and widened by the weather and the wash\r\nof rains. The valley glacier may easily be from one thousand to three\r\nthousand feet deep and from one to three miles wide. Such a ponderous\r\nbulk of slowly moving ice does not readily adapt itself to sharp turns\r\nand a narrow bed. By scouring and plucking all resisting edges it\r\ndevelops a fitting channel with a wide, flat floor, and steep, smooth\r\nsides, above which are seen the weathered slopes of stream-worn\r\nmountain valleys. Since the trunk glacier requires a deeper channel\r\nthan do its branches, the bed of a branch glacier enters the main\r\ntrough at some distance above the floor of the latter, although the\r\nsurface of the two ice streams may be accordant. Glacier troughs can\r\nbe studied best where large glaciers have recently melted completely\r\naway, as is the case in many valleys of the mountains of the western\r\nUnited States and of central and northern Europe (Fig. 114). The\r\ntypical glacier trough, as shown in such examples, is U-shaped, with a\r\nbroad, flat floor, and high, steep walls. Its walls are little broken\r\nby projecting spurs and lateral ravines. It is as if a V-valley cut by\r\na river had afterwards been gouged deeper with a gigantic chisel,\r\nwidening the floor to the width of the chisel blade, cutting back the\r\nspurs, and smoothing and steepening the sides. A river valley could\r\nonly be as wide-floored as this after it had long been worn down to\r\ngrade.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 115 Lynn Canal, Alaska, a Fjord]\r\n\r\nBut the floor of a glacier trough may not be graded; it is often\r\ninterrupted by irregular steps perhaps hundreds and even a thousand\r\nfeet in height, over which the stream that now drains the valley\r\ntumbles in waterfalls. Reaches between the steps are often basined.\r\nLakelets may occupy hollows excavated in solid rock, and other lakes\r\nmay be held behind terminal moraines left as dams across the valley at\r\npauses in the retreat of the glacier.\r\n\r\n=Fjords= are glacier troughs now occupied in part or wholly by the\r\nsea, either because they were excavated by a tide glacier to their\r\npresent depth below sea level, or because of a submergence of the\r\nland. Their characteristic form is that of a long, deep, narrow bay\r\nwith steep rock walls and basined floor (Fig. 115). Fjords are found\r\nonly in regions which have suffered glaciation, such as Norway and\r\nAlaska.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 116. _A_, V-River Valley, with Valley of\r\n      Tributary joining it a Accordant Level; _B_, the Same changed\r\n      after Long Glaciation to a Trough with Hanging Valley]\r\n\r\n=Hanging valleys.= These are lateral valleys which open on their main\r\nvalley some distance above its floor. They are conspicuous features of\r\nglacier troughs from which the ice has vanished; for the trunk glacier\r\nin widening and deepening its channel cut its bed below the bottoms of\r\nthe lateral valleys (Fig. 116).\r\n\r\nSince the mouths of hanging valleys are suspended on the walls of the\r\nglacier trough, their streams are compelled to plunge down its steep,\r\nhigh sides in waterfalls. Some of the loftiest and most beautiful\r\nwaterfalls of the world leap from hanging valleys,--among them the\r\ncelebrated Staubbach of the Lauterbrunnen valley of Switzerland, and\r\nthose of the fjords of Norway and Alaska (Fig. 117).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 117. Hanging Valley on the Wall of a Fjord,\r\n      Norway]\r\n\r\nHanging valleys are found also in river gorges where the smaller\r\ntributaries have not been able to keep pace with a strong master\r\nstream in cutting down their beds. In this case, however, they are a\r\nmark of extreme youth; for, as the trunk stream approaches grade and\r\nits velocity and power to erode its bed decrease, the side streams\r\nsoon cut back their falls and wear their beds at their mouths to a\r\ncommon level with that of the main river. The Grand Canyon of the\r\nColorado must be reckoned a young valley. At its base it narrows to\r\nscarcely more than the width of the river, and yet its tributaries,\r\nexcept the very smallest, enter it at a common level.\r\n\r\nWhy could not a wide-floored valley, such as a glacier trough, with\r\nhanging valleys opening upon it, be produced in the normal development\r\nof a river valley?\r\n\r\n=The troughs of young and of mature glaciers.= The features of a\r\nglacier trough depend much on the length of time the preexisting\r\nvalley was occupied with ice. During the infancy of a glacier, we may\r\nbelieve, the spurs of the valley which it fills are but little blunted\r\nand its bed is but little broken by steps. In youth the glacier\r\ndevelops icefalls, as a river in youth develops waterfalls, and its\r\nbed becomes terraced with great stairs. The mature glacier, like the\r\nmature river, has effaced its falls and smoothed its bed to grade. It\r\nhas also worn back the projecting spurs of its valley, making itself a\r\nwide channel with smooth sides. The bed of a mature glacier may form a\r\nlong basin, since it abrades most in its upper and middle course,\r\nwhere its weight and motion are the greatest. Near the terminus, where\r\nweight and motion are the least, it erodes least, and may instead\r\ndeposit a sheet of ground moraine, much as a river builds a flood\r\nplain in the same part of its course as it approaches maturity. The\r\nbed of a mature glacier thus tends to take the form of a long,\r\nrelatively narrow basin, across whose lower end may be stretched the\r\ndam of the terminal moraine. On the disappearance of the ice the basin\r\nis rilled with a long, narrow lake, such as Lake Chelan in Washington\r\nand many of the lakes in the Highlands of Scotland.\r\n\r\nPiedmont glaciers apparently erode but little. Beneath their lake-like\r\nexpanse of sluggish or stagnant ice a broad sheet of ground moraine is\r\nprobably being deposited.\r\n\r\nCirques and glaciated valleys rapidly lose their characteristic forms\r\nafter the ice has withdrawn. The weather destroys all smoothed,\r\npolished, and scored surfaces which are not protected beneath glacial\r\ndeposits. The over-steepened sides of the trough are graded by\r\nlandslips, by talus slopes, and by alluvial cones. Morainic heaps of\r\ndrift are dissected and carried away. Hanging valleys and the\r\nirregular bed of the trough are both worn down to grade by the streams\r\nwhich now occupy them. The length of time since the retreat of the ice\r\nfrom a mountain valley may thus be estimated by the degree to which\r\nthe destruction of the characteristic features of the glacier trough\r\nhas been carried.\r\n\r\nIn Figure 104 what characteristics of a glacier trough do you notice?\r\nWhat inference do you draw as to the former thickness of the glacier?\r\n\r\nName all the evidences you would expect to find to prove the fact that\r\nin the recent geological past the valleys of the Alps contained far\r\nlarger glaciers than at present, and that on the north of the Alps the\r\nice streams united in a piedmont glacier which extended across the\r\nplains of Switzerland to the sides of the Jura Mountains.\r\n\r\n=The relative importance of glaciers and of rivers.= Powerful as\r\nglaciers are, and marked as are the land forms which they produce, it\r\nis easy to exaggerate their geological importance as compared with\r\nrivers. Under present climatic conditions they are confined to lofty\r\nmountains or polar lands. Polar ice sheets are permanent only so long\r\nas the lands remain on which they rest. Mountain glaciers can stay\r\nonly the brief time during which the ranges continue young and high.\r\nAs lofty mountains, such as the Selkirks and the Alps, are lowered by\r\nfrost and glacier ice, the snowfall will decrease, the line of\r\npermanent snow will rise, and as the mountain hollows in which snow\r\nmay gather are worn beneath the snow line, the glaciers must\r\ndisappear. Under present climatic conditions the work of glaciers is\r\ntherefore both local and of short duration.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 118. Longitudinal Section of a Tide Glacier\r\n        occupying a Fjord and discharging Icebergs\r\n      Dotted Line, sea level]\r\n\r\nEven the glacial epoch, during which vast ice sheets deposited drift\r\nover northeastern North America, must have been brief as well as\r\nrecent, for many lofty mountains, such as the Rockies and the Alps,\r\nstill bear the marks of great glaciers which then filled their\r\nvalleys. Had the glacial epoch been long, as the earth counts time,\r\nthese mountains would have been worn low by ice; had the epoch been\r\nremote, the marks of glaciation would already have been largely\r\ndestroyed by other agencies.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, rivers are well-nigh universally at work over the\r\nland surfaces of the globe, and ever since the dry land appeared they\r\nhave been constantly engaged in leveling the continents and in\r\ndelivering to the seas the waste which there is built into the\r\nstratified rocks.\r\n\r\n=Icebergs.= Tide glaciers, such as those of Greenland and Alaska, are\r\nable to excavate their beds to a considerable distance below sea\r\nlevel. From their fronts the buoyancy of sea water raises and breaks\r\naway great masses of ice which float out to sea as icebergs. Only\r\nabout one seventh of a mass of glacier ice floats above the surface,\r\nand a berg three hundred feet high may be estimated to have been\r\ndetached from a glacier not less than two thousand feet thick where it\r\nmet the sea.\r\n\r\nIcebergs transport on their long journeys whatever drift they may have\r\ncarried when part of the glacier, and scatter it, as they melt, over\r\nthe ocean floor. In this way pebbles torn by the inland ice from the\r\nrocks of the interior of Greenland and glaciated during their carriage\r\nin the ground moraine are dropped at last among the oozes of the\r\nbottom of the North Atlantic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE WORK OF THE WIND\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 119. A sandy Region in a Desert, the Sahara]\r\n\r\nWe are now to study the geological work of the currents of the\r\natmosphere, and to learn how they erode, and transport and deposit\r\nwaste as they sweep over the land. Illustrations of the wind's work\r\nare at hand in dry weather on any windy day.\r\n\r\nClouds of dust are raised from the street and driven along by the\r\ngale. Here the roadway is swept bare; and there, in sheltered places,\r\nthe dust settles in little windrows. The erosive power of waste-laden\r\ncurrents of air is suggested as the sharp grains of flying sand sting\r\none's face or clatter against the window. In the country one sometimes\r\nsees the dust whirled in clouds from dry, plowed fields in spring and\r\nleft in the lee of fences in small drifts resembling in form those of\r\nsnow in winter.\r\n\r\n=The essential conditions= for the wind's conspicuous work are\r\nillustrated in these simple examples; they are aridity and the absence\r\nof vegetation. In humid climates these conditions are only rarely and\r\nlocally met; for the most part a thick growth of vegetation protects\r\nthe moist soil from the wind with a cover of leaves and stems and a\r\nmattress of interlacing roots. But in arid regions either vegetation\r\nis wholly lacking, or scant growths are found huddled in detached\r\nclumps, leaving interspaces of unprotected ground (Fig. 119). Here,\r\ntoo, the mantle of waste, which is formed chiefly under the action of\r\ntemperature changes, remains dry and loose for long periods. Little or\r\nno moisture is present to cause its particles to cohere, and they are\r\ntherefore readily lifted and drifted by the wind.\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation By The Wind\r\n\r\nIn the desert the finer waste is continually swept to and fro by the\r\never-shifting wind. Even in quiet weather the air heated by contact\r\nwith the hot sands rises in whirls, and the dust is lifted in stately\r\ncolumns, sometimes as much as one thousand feet in height, which march\r\nslowly across the plain. In storms the sand is driven along the ground\r\nin a continuous sheet, while the air is tilled with dust. Explorers\r\ntell of sand storms in the deserts of central Asia and Africa, in\r\nwhich the air grows murky and suffocating. Even at midday it may\r\nbecome dark as night, and nothing can be heard except the roar of the\r\nblast and the whir of myriads of grains of sand as they fly past the\r\near.\r\n\r\nSand storms are by no means uncommon in the arid regions of the\r\nwestern United States. In a recent year, six were reported from Yuma,\r\nArizona. Trains on transcontinental railways are occasionally\r\nblockaded by drifting sand, and the dust sifts into closed passenger\r\ncoaches, covering the seats and floors. After such a storm thirteen\r\ncar loads of sand were removed from the platform of a station on a\r\nwestern railway.\r\n\r\n=Dust falls.= Dust launched by upward-whirling winds on the swift\r\ncurrents of the upper air is often blown for hundreds of miles beyond\r\nthe arid region from which it was taken. Dust falls from western\r\nstorms are not unknown even as far east as the Great Lakes. In 1896 a\r\n\"black snow\" fell in Chicago, and in another dust storm in the same\r\ndecade the amount of dust carried in the air over Rock Island, Ill.,\r\nwas estimated at more than one thousand tons to the cubic mile.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 120. A Tract of Rocky Desert, Arabia\r\n      By what process have these rocks been broken up?\r\n      Why is finer waste here absent?]\r\n\r\nIn March, 1901, a cyclonic storm carried vast quantities of dust from\r\nthe Sahara northward across the Mediterranean to fall over southern\r\nand central Europe. On March 8th dust storms raged in southern\r\nAlgeria; two days later the dust fell in Italy; and on the 11th it had\r\nreached central Germany and Denmark. It is estimated that in these few\r\ndays one million eight hundred thousand tons of waste were carried\r\nfrom northern Africa and deposited on European soil.\r\n\r\nWe may see from these examples the importance of the wind as an agent\r\nof transportation, and how vast in the aggregate are the loads which\r\nit carries. There are striking differences between air and water as\r\ncarriers of waste. Rivers flow in fixed and narrow channels to\r\ndefinite goals. The channelless streams of the air sweep across broad\r\nareas, and, shifting about continually, carry their loads back and\r\nforth, now in one direction and now in another.\r\n\r\n\r\nWind Deposits\r\n\r\nThe mantle of waste of deserts is rapidly sorted by the wind. The\r\ncoarser rubbish, too heavy to be lifted into the air, is left to strew\r\nwide tracts with residual gravels (Fig. 120). The sand derived from\r\nthe disintegration of desert rocks gathers in vast fields. About one\r\neighth of the surface of the Sahara is said to be thus covered with\r\ndrifting sand. In desert mountains, as those of Sinai, it lies like\r\nfields of snow in the high valleys below the sharp peaks. On more\r\nlevel tracts it accumulates in seas of sand, sometimes, as in the\r\ndeserts of Arabia, two hundred and more feet deep.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 121. Longitudinal Dunes, Desert of\r\n        Northwestern India\r\n      Scale, 1 in = 3 miles]\r\n\r\n=Dunes.= The sand thus accumulated by the wind is heaped in wavelike\r\nhills called dunes. In the desert of northwestern India, where the\r\nprevalent wind is of great strength, the sand is laid in longitudinal\r\ndunes, i.e. in stripes running parallel with the direction of the\r\nwind; but commonly dunes lie, like ripple marks, transverse to the\r\nwind current. On the windward side they show a long, gentle slope, up\r\nwhich grains of sand can readily be moved; while to the lee their\r\nslope is frequently as great as the angle of repose (Fig. 122). Dunes\r\nwhose sands are not fixed by vegetation travel slowly with the wind;\r\nfor their material is ever shifted forward as the grains are driven up\r\nthe windward slope and, falling over the crest, are deposited in\r\nslanting layers in the quiet of the lee.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 122. A Transverse Dune, Seven Mile Beach,\r\n        New Jersey\r\n      Account for the difference of slope in the two sides of the\r\n      dune. Is the dune marching? In what direction? With what\r\n      effect? Do the ridges of the ripple marks upon the dune extend\r\n      along it or athwart it? Why?]\r\n\r\nLike river deposits, wind-blown sands are stratified, since they are\r\nlaid by currents of air varying in intensity, and therefore in\r\ntransporting power, which carry now finer and now coarser materials\r\nand lay them down where their velocity is checked (Fig. 123). Since\r\nthe wind varies in direction, the strata dip in various directions.\r\nThey also dip at various angles, according to the inclination of the\r\nsurface on which they were laid.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 123. Stratified Wind-Blown Sands, Bermuda\r\n        Islands\r\n      These islands are made wholly of limestone, the product of\r\n      reef-building corals, and of lime from the sea water. The\r\n      limestone sand of the beaches has been blown up into great\r\n      dunes, some more than two hundred feet in height. Much of the\r\n      loose dune sand has been changed to firm rock by percolating\r\n      waters, which have dissolved some of the limestone and\r\n      deposited it again as a cement between the grains]\r\n\r\nDunes occur not only in arid regions, but also wherever loose sand\r\nlies unprotected by vegetation from the wind. From the beaches of sea\r\nand lake shores the wind drives inland the surface sand left dry\r\nbetween tides and after storms, piling it in dunes which may invade\r\nforests and fields and bury villages beneath their slowly advancing\r\nwaves. On flood plains during summer droughts river deposits are often\r\nworked over by the wind; the sand is heaped in hummocks and much of\r\nthe fine silt is caught and held by the forests and grassy fields of\r\nthe bordering hills.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 124. Cross Section of Transverse Dune after\r\n      Reversal of Wind\r\n\r\n   Redraw diagram, showing by dotted line the original outline of\r\n   the dune]\r\n\r\nThe sand of shore dunes differs little in composition and the shape of\r\nits grains from that of the beach from which it was derived. But in\r\ndeserts, by the long wear of grain on grain as they are blown hither\r\nand thither by the wind, all soft minerals are ground to powder and\r\nthe sand comes to consist almost wholly of smooth round grams of hard\r\nquartz.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 125. Dune Sands, Shore of Lake Michigan\r\n\r\n   Account for the dead forest, for its leaning tree trunks. Is\r\n   the lake shore to the right or left? What has been the history\r\n   of the landscape?]\r\n\r\nSome marine sandstones, such as the St. Peter sandstone of the upper\r\nMississippi valley, are composed so entirely of polished spherules of\r\nquartz that it has been believed by some that their grains were long\r\nblown about in ancient deserts before they were deposited in the sea.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 126. Crescentic Sand Dunes, Valley of the\r\n      Columbia River\r\n\r\n   Did the wind which shaped them blow from the left or from the\r\n   right?]\r\n\r\n=Dust deposits.= As desert sands are composed almost wholly of quartz,\r\nwe may ask what has become of the softer minerals of which the rocks\r\nwhose disintegration has supplied the sand were in part, and often in\r\nlarge part, composed. The softer minerals have been ground to powder,\r\nand little by little the quartz sand also is worn by attrition to fine\r\ndust. Yet dust deposits are scant and few in great deserts such as the\r\nSahara. The finer waste is blown beyond its limits and laid in\r\nadjacent oceans, where it adds to the muds and oozes of their floors,\r\nand on bordering steppes and forest lands, where it is bound fast by\r\nvegetation and slowly accumulates in deposits of unstratified loose\r\nyellow earth. The fine waste of the Sahara has been identified in\r\ndredgings from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, taken hundreds of\r\nmiles from the coast of Africa.\r\n\r\n=Loess.= In northern China an area as large as France is deeply\r\ncovered with a yellow pulverulent earth called loess (German, loose),\r\nwhich many consider a dust deposit blown from the great Mongolian\r\ndesert lying to the west. Loess mantles the recently uplifted\r\nmountains to the height of eight thousand feet and descends on the\r\nplains nearly to sea level. Its texture and lack of stratification\r\ngive it a vertical cleavage; hence it stands in steep cliffs on the\r\nsides of the deep and narrow trenches which have been cut in it by\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\nOn loess hillsides in China are thousands of villages whose eavelike\r\ndwellings have been excavated in this soft, yet firm, dry loam. While\r\ndust falls are common at the present time in this region, the loess is\r\nnow being rapidly denuded by streams, and its yellow silt gives name\r\nto the muddy Hwang-ho (Yellow River), and to the Yellow Sea, whose\r\nwaters it discolors for scores of miles from shore.\r\n\r\nWind deposits both of dust and of sand may be expected to contain the\r\nremains of land shells, bits of wood, and bones of land animals,\r\ntestifying to the fact that they were accumulated in open air and not\r\nin the sea or in bodies of fresh water.\r\n\r\n\r\nWind Erosion\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 127. Wind-Carved Rocks, Arizona]\r\n\r\nSand-laden currents of air abrade and smooth and polish exposed rock\r\nsurfaces, acting in much the same way as does the jet of steam fed\r\nwith sharp sand, which is used in the manufacture of ground glass.\r\nIndeed, in a single storm at Cape Cod a plate glass of a lighthouse\r\nwas so ground by flying sand that its transparency was destroyed and\r\nits removal made necessary.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 128. A Wind-Carved Pebble, Cape Cod]\r\n\r\nTelegraph poles and wires whetted by wind-blown sands are destroyed\r\nwithin a few years. In rocks of unequal resistance the harder parts\r\nare left in relief, while the softer are etched away. Thus in the pass\r\nof San Bernardino, Cal., through which strong winds stream from the\r\nwest, crystals of garnet are left projecting on delicate rock fingers\r\nfrom the softer rock in which they were imbedded.\r\n\r\nWind-carved pebbles are characteristically planed, the facets meeting\r\nalong a summit ridge or at a point like that of a pyramid. We may\r\nsuppose that these facets were ground by prevalent winds from certain\r\ndirections, or that from time to time the stone was undermined and\r\nrolled over as the sand beneath it was blown away on the windward\r\nside, thus exposing fresh surfaces to the driving sand. Such\r\nwind-carved pebbles are sometimes found in ancient rocks and may be\r\naccepted as evidence that the sands of which the rocks are composed\r\nwere blown about by the wind.\r\n\r\n=Deflation.= In the denudation of an arid region, wind erosion is\r\ncomparatively ineffective as compared with deflation (Latin, _de_,\r\nfrom; _flare_, to blow),--a term by which is meant the constant\r\nremoval of waste by the wind, leaving the rocks bare to the continuous\r\nattack of the weather. In moist climates denudation is continually\r\nimpeded by the mantle of waste and its cover of vegetation, and the\r\nland surface can be lowered no faster than the waste is removed by\r\nrunning water. Deep residual soils come to protect all regions of\r\nmoderate slope, concealing from view the rock structure, and the\r\nvarious forms of the land are due more to the agencies of erosion and\r\ntransportation than to differences in the resistance of the underlying\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 129. Mesa Verde, Colorado\r\n\r\n   In the distance on the left are high volcanic mountains. On the\r\n   extreme right are seen outliers of strata which once covered\r\n   the region of the mesa]\r\n\r\nBut in arid regions the mantle is rapidly removed, even from well-nigh\r\nlevel plains and plateaus, by the sweep of the wind and the wash of\r\noccasional rains. The geological structure of these regions of naked\r\nrock can be read as far as the eye can see, and it is to this\r\nstructure that the forms of the land are there largely due. In a land\r\nmass of horizontal strata, for example, any softer surface rocks wear\r\ndown to some underlying, resistant stratum, and this for a while forms\r\nthe surface of a level plateau (Fig. 129). The edges of the capping\r\nlayer, together with those of any softer layers beneath it, wear back\r\nin steep cliffs, dissected by the valleys of wet-weather streams and\r\noften swept bare to the base by the wind. As they are little protected\r\nby talus, which commonly is removed about as fast as formed, these\r\nescarpments and the walls of the valleys retreat indefinitely,\r\nexposing some hard stratum beneath which forms the floor of a widening\r\nterrace.\r\n\r\nThe high plateaus of northern Arizona and southern Utah (Fig. 130),\r\nnorth of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River, are composed of\r\nstratified rocks more than ten thousand feet thick and of very gentle\r\ninclination northward. From the broad plat form in which the canyon\r\nhas been cut rises a series of gigantic stairs, which are often more\r\nthan one thousand feet high and a score or more of miles in breadth.\r\nThe retreating escarpments, the cliffs of the mesas and buttes which\r\nthey have left behind as outliers, and the walls of the ravines are\r\ncarved into noble architectural forms--into cathedrals, pyramids,\r\namphitheaters, towers, arches, and colonnades--by the processes of\r\nweathering aided by deflation. It is thus by the help of the action of\r\nthe wind that great plateaus in arid regions are dissected and at last\r\nare smoothed away to waterless plains, either composed of naked rock,\r\nor strewed with residual gravels, or covered with drifting residual\r\nsand.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 130.

Sea Cliff and Rock Bench Cut in Chalk,\r\n      Dover, England]\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the ocean is the goal at which the waste of\r\nthe land arrives. The mantle of rock waste, creeping down slopes, is\r\nwashed to the sea by streams, together with the material which the\r\nstreams have worn from their beds and that dissolved by underground\r\nwaters. In arid regions the winds sweep waste either into bordering\r\noceans or into more humid regions where rivers take it up and carry it\r\non to the sea. Glaciers deliver the load of their moraines either\r\ndirectly to the sea or leave it for streams to transport to the same\r\ngoal. All deposits made on the land, such as the flood plains of\r\nrivers, the silts of lake beds, dune sands, and sheets of glacial\r\ndrift, mark but pauses in the process which is to bring all the\r\nmaterials of the land now above sea level to rest upon the ocean bed.\r\n\r\nBut the sea is also at work along all its shores as an agent of\r\ndestruction, and we must first take up its work in erosion before we\r\nconsider how it transports and deposits the waste of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nSea Erosion\r\n\r\n=The sea cliff and the rock bench.= On many coasts the land fronts the\r\nocean in a line of cliffs (Fig. 131). To the edge of the cliffs there\r\nlead down valleys and ridges, carved by running water, which, if\r\nextended, would meet the water surface some way out from shore.\r\nEvidently they are now abruptly cut short at the present shore line\r\nbecause the land has been cut back.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 132. Diagram of Sea Cliff _sc_, and Rock Bench _rb_\r\n\r\n   The broken line indicates the former extent of the land.]\r\n\r\nAlong the foot of the cliff lies a gently shelving bench of rock, more\r\nor less thickly veneered with sand and shingle. At low tide its inner\r\nmargin is laid bare, but at high tide it is covered wholly, and the\r\nsea washes the base of the cliffs. A notch, of which the _sea cliff_\r\nand the _rock bench_ are the two sides, has been cut along the shore\r\n(Fig. 132).\r\n\r\n=Waves.= The position of the rock bench, with its inner margin\r\nslightly above low tide, shows that it has been cut by some agent\r\nwhich acts like a horizontal saw set at about sea level. This agent is\r\nclearly the surface agitation of the water; it is the wind-raised\r\nwave.\r\n\r\nAs a wave comes up the shelving bench the crest topples forward and\r\nthe wave \"breaks,\" striking a blow whose force is measured by the\r\nmomentum of all its tons of falling water (Fig. 133). On the coast of\r\nScotland the force of the blows struck by the waves of the heaviest\r\nstorms has sometimes exceeded three tons to the square foot. But even\r\na calm sea constantly chafes the shore. It heaves in gentle\r\nundulations known as the ground swell, the result of storms perhaps a\r\nthousand miles distant, and breaks on the shore in surf.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 133. Breaking Wave, Lake Superior]\r\n\r\nThe blows of the waves are not struck with clear water only, else they\r\nwould have little effect on cliffs of solid rock. Storm waves arm\r\nthemselves with the sand and gravel, the cobbles, and even the large\r\nbowlders which lie at the base of the cliff, and beat against it with\r\nthese hammers of stone.\r\n\r\nWhere a precipice descends sheer into deep water, waves swash up and\r\ndown the face of the rocks but cannot break and strike effective\r\nblows. They therefore erode but little until the talus fallen from the\r\ncliff is gradually built up beneath the sea to the level at which the\r\nwaves drag bottom upon it and break.\r\n\r\nCompare the ways in which different agents abrade. The wind lightly\r\nbrushes sand and dust over exposed surfaces of rock. Running water\r\nsweeps fragments of various sizes along its channels, holding them\r\nwith a loose hand. Glacial ice grinds the stones of its ground moraine\r\nagainst the underlying rock with the pressure of its enormous weight.\r\nThe wave hurls fragments of rock against the sea cliff, bruising and\r\nbattering it by the blow. It also rasps the bench as it drags sand and\r\ngravel to and fro upon it.\r\n\r\n=Weathering of sea cliffs.= The sea cliff furnishes the weapons for\r\nits own destruction. They are broken from it not only by the wave but\r\nalso by the weather. Indeed the sea cliff weathers more rapidly, as a\r\nrule, than do rock ledges inland. It is abundantly wet with spray.\r\nAlong its base the ground water of the neighboring land finds its\r\nnatural outlet in springs which under mine it. Moreover, it is\r\nunprotected by any shield of talus. Fragments of rock as they fall\r\nfrom its face are battered to pieces by the waves and swept out to\r\nsea. The cliff is thus left exposed to the attack of the weather, and\r\nits retreat would be comparatively rapid for this reason alone.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 134. Sea Caves, La Jolla, California\r\n\r\n   Copyright, 1899, by the Detroit Photography Company]\r\n\r\nSea cliffs seldom overhang, but commonly, as in Figure 134, slope\r\nseaward, showing that the upper portion has retreated at a more rapid\r\nrate than has the base. Which do you infer is on the whole the more\r\ndestructive agent, weathering or the wave?\r\n\r\nDraw a section of a sea cliff cut in well jointed rocks whose joints\r\ndip toward the land. Draw a diagram of a sea cliff where the joints\r\ndip toward the sea.\r\n\r\n=Sea caves.= The wave does not merely batter the face of the cliff.\r\nLike a skillful quarryman it inserts wedges in all natural fissures,\r\nsuch as joints, and uses explosive forces. As a wave flaps against a\r\ncrevice it compresses the air within with the sudden stroke; as it\r\nfalls back the air as suddenly expands. On lighthouses heavily barred\r\ndoors have been burst outward by the explosive force of the air\r\nwithin, as it was released from pressure when a partial vacuum was\r\nformed by the refluence of the wave. Where a crevice is filled with\r\nwater the entire force of the blow of the wave is transmitted by\r\nhydraulic pressure to the sides of the fissure. Thus storm waves\r\nlittle by little pry and suck the rock loose, and in this way, and by\r\nthe blows which they strike with the stones of the beach, they quarry\r\nout about a joint, or wherever the rock may be weak, a recess known as\r\na _sea cave_, provided that the rock above is coherent enough to form\r\na roof. Otherwise an open chasm results.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 135. A Sea Arch, California\r\n\r\n   Copyright, 1899, by the Detroit Photography Company]\r\n\r\n=Blowholes and sea arches.= As a sea cave is drilled back into the\r\nrock, it may encounter a joint or crevice opened to the surface by\r\npercolating water. The shock of the waves soon enlarges this to a\r\nblowhole, which one may find on the breezy upland, perhaps a hundred\r\nyards and more back from the cliff's edge. In quiet weather the\r\nblowhole is a deep well; in storm it plays a fountain as the waves\r\ndrive through the long tunnel below and spout their spray high in air\r\nin successive jets. As the roof of the cave thus breaks down in the\r\nrear, there may remain in front for a while a sea arch, similar to the\r\nnatural bridges of land caverns (Fig. 135).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 136. Chasms worn by Waves, Coast of Scotland]\r\n\r\n=Stacks and wave-cut islands.= As the sea drives its tunnels and open\r\ndrifts into the cliff, it breaks through behind the intervening\r\nportions and leaves them isolated as stacks, much as monuments are\r\ndetached from inland escarpments by the weather; and as the sea cliff\r\nretreats, these remnant masses may be left behind as rocky islets.\r\nThus the rock bench is often set with stacks, islets in all stages of\r\ndestruction, and sunken reefs,--all wrecks of the land testifying to\r\nits retreat before the incessant attack of the waves.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 137. A Stack, Scotland]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 138. Wave-Cut Islands, Scotland\r\n\r\n   How far did the land once extend?]\r\n\r\n=Coves.= Where zones of soft or closely jointed rock outcrop along a\r\nshore, or where minor water courses conic down to the sea and aid in\r\nerosion, the shore is worn back in curved reëntrants called coves;\r\nwhile the more resistant rocks on either hand are left projecting as\r\nheadlands (Fig. 139). After coves are cut back a short distance by the\r\nwaves, the headlands come to protect them, as with breakwaters, and\r\nprevent their indefinite retreat. The shore takes a curve of\r\nequilibrium, along which the hard rock of the exposed headland and the\r\nweak rock of the protected cove wear back at an equal rate.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 139. Coves formed in Softer Strata _S_, _S_;\r\n     while the Harder Strata _H_, _H_, are left as Headlands]\r\n\r\n=Rate of recession.= The rate at which a shore recedes depends on\r\nseveral factors. In soft or incoherent rocks exposed to violent storms\r\nthe retreat is so rapid as to be easily measured. The coast of\r\nYorkshire, England, whose cliffs are cut in glacial drift, loses seven\r\nfeet a year on the average, and since the Norman conquest a strip a\r\nmile wide, with farmsteads and villages and historic seaports, has\r\nbeen devoured by the sea. The sandy south shore of Martha's Vineyard\r\nwears back three feet a year. But hard rocks retreat so slowly that\r\ntheir recession has seldom been measured by the records of history.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 140. A Pebble Beach, Cape Ann, Massachusetts]\r\n\r\n\r\nShore Drift\r\n\r\n=Bowlder and pebble beaches.= About as fast as formed the waste of the\r\nsea cliff is swept both along the shore and out to sea. The road of\r\nwaste along shore is the _beach_. We may also define the beach as the\r\nexposed edge of the sheet of sediment formed by the carriage of land\r\nwaste out to sea. At the foot of sea cliffs, where the waves are\r\npounding hardest, one commonly finds the rock bench strewn on its\r\ninner margin with large stones, dislodged by the waves and by the\r\nweather and somewhat worn on their corners and edges. From this\r\n_bowlder beach_ the smaller fragments of waste from the cliff and the\r\nfragments into which the bowlders are at last broken drift on to more\r\nsheltered places and there accumulate in a _pebble beach_, made of\r\npebbles well rounded by the wear which they have suffered. Such\r\nbeaches form a mill whose raw material is constantly supplied by the\r\ncliff. The breakers of storms set it in motion to a depth of several\r\nfeet, grinding the pebbles together with a clatter to be heard above\r\nthe roar of the surf. In such a rock crusher the life of a pebble is\r\nshort. Where ships have stranded on our Atlantic coast with cargoes of\r\nhard-burned brick or of coal, a year of time and a drift of five miles\r\nalong the shore have proved enough to wear brick and coal to powder.\r\nAt no great distance from their source, therefore, pebble beaches give\r\nplace to beaches of sand, which occupy the more sheltered reaches of\r\nthe shore.\r\n\r\n=Sand beaches.= The angular sand grains of various minerals into which\r\npebbles are broken by the waves are ground together under the beating\r\nsurf and rounded, and those of the softer minerals are crushed to\r\npowder. The process, however, is a slow one, and if we study these\r\nsand grains under a lens we may be surprised to see that, though their\r\ncorners and edges have been blunted, they are yet far from the\r\nspherical form of the pebbles from which they were derived. The grains\r\nare small, and in water they have lost about half their weight in\r\nair; the blows which they strike one another are therefore weak.\r\nBesides, each grain of sand of the wet beach is protected by a cushion\r\nof water from the blows of its neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe shape and size of these grains and the relative proportion of\r\ngrains of the softer minerals which still remain give a rough measure\r\nof the distance in space and time which they have traveled from their\r\nsource. The sand of many beaches, derived from the rocks of adjacent\r\ncliffs or brought in by torrential streams from neighboring highlands,\r\nis dark with grains of a number of minerals softer than quartz. The\r\nwhite sand of other beaches, as those of the east coast of Florida, is\r\nalmost wholly composed of quartz grains; for in its long travel down\r\nthe Atlantic coast the weaker minerals have been worn to powder and\r\nthe hardest alone survive.\r\n\r\nHow does the absence of cleavage in quartz affect the durability of\r\nquartz sand?\r\n\r\n=How shore drift migrates.= It is under the action of waves and\r\ncurrents that shore drift migrates slowly along a coast. Where waves\r\nstrike a coast obliquely they drive the waste before them little by\r\nlittle along the shore. Thus on a north-south coast, where the\r\npredominant storms are from the northeast, there will be a migration\r\nof shore drift southwards.\r\n\r\nAll shores are swept also by currents produced by winds and tides.\r\nThese are usually far too gentle to transport of themselves the coarse\r\nmaterials of which beaches are made. But while the wave stirs the\r\ngrains of sand and gravel, and for a moment lifts them from the\r\nbottom, the current carries them a step forward on their way. The\r\ncurrent cannot lift and the wave cannot carry, but together the two\r\ntransport the waste along the shore. The road of shore drift is\r\ntherefore the zone of the breaking waves.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 141. A Bay Bar, Lake Ontario]\r\n\r\n=The bay-head beach.= As the waste derived from the wear of waves and\r\nthat brought in by streams is trailed along a coast it assumes, under\r\nvarying conditions, a number of distinct forms. When swept into the\r\nhead of a sheltered bay it constitutes the bay-head beach. By the\r\nhighest storm waves the beach is often built higher than the ground\r\nimmediately behind it, and forms a dam inclosing a shallow pond or\r\nmarsh.\r\n\r\n=The bay bar.= As the stream of shore drift reaches the mouth of a bay\r\nof some size it often occurs that, instead of turning in, it sets\r\ndirectly across toward the opposite headland. The waste is carried out\r\nfrom shore into the deeper waters of the bay mouth; where it is no\r\nlonger supported by the breaking waves, and sinks to the bottom. The\r\ndump is gradually built to the surface as a stubby spur, pointing\r\nacross the bay, and as it reaches the zone of wave action current and\r\nwave can now combine to carry shore drift along it, depositing their\r\nload continually at the point of the spur. An embankment is thus\r\nconstructed in much the same manner as a railway fill, which, while it\r\nis building, serves as a roadway along which the dirt from an adjacent\r\ncut is carted to be dumped at the end. When the embankment is\r\ncompleted it bridges the bay with a highway along which shore drift\r\nnow moves without interruption, and becomes a bay bar.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 142. A Hook, Lake Michigan]\r\n\r\n=Incomplete bay bars.= Under certain conditions the sea cannot carry\r\nout its intention to bridge a bay. Rivers discharging in bays demand\r\nopen way to the ocean. Strong tidal currents also are able to keep\r\nopen channels scoured by their ebb and flow. In such cases the most\r\nthat land waste can do is to build spits and shoals, narrowing and\r\nshoaling the channel as much as possible. Incomplete bay bars\r\nsometimes have their points recurved by currents setting at right\r\nangles to the stream of shore drift and are then classified as _hooks_\r\n(Fig. 142).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 143. Cross Section of Sand Reef _sr_, and\r\n      Lagoon; _sl_, Sea Level]\r\n\r\n=Sand reefs.= On low coasts where shallow water extends some distance\r\nout, the highway of shore drift lies along a low, narrow ridge, termed\r\nthe sand reef, separated from the land by a narrow stretch of shallow\r\nwater called the _lagoon_ (Fig. 143). At intervals the reef is held\r\nopen by _inlets_,--gaps through which the tide flows and ebbs, and by\r\nwhich the water of streams finds way to the sea.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 144. Sand Reef and Lagoon, Texas]\r\n\r\nNo finer example of this kind of shore line is to be found in the\r\nworld than the coast of Texas. From near the mouth of the Rio Grande a\r\ncontinuous sand reef draws its even curve for a hundred miles to\r\nCorpus Christi Pass, and the reefs are but seldom interrupted by\r\ninlets as far north as Galveston Harbor. On this coast the tides are\r\nvariable and exceptionally weak, being less than one foot in height,\r\nwhile the amount of waste swept along the shore is large. The lagoon\r\nis extremely shallow, and much of it is a mud flat too shoal for even\r\nsmall boats. On the coast of New Jersey strong tides are able to keep\r\nopen inlets at intervals of from two to twenty miles in spite of a\r\nheavy alongshore drift.\r\n\r\nSand reefs are formed where the water is so shallow near shore that\r\nstorm waves cannot run in it and therefore break some distance out\r\nfrom land. Where storm waves first drag bottom they erode and deepen\r\nthe sea floor, and sweep in sediment as far as the line where they\r\nbreak. Here, where they lose their force, they drop their load and\r\nbeat up the ridge which is known as the sand reef when it reaches the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n\r\nShores of Elevation and Depression\r\n\r\nOur studies have already brought to our notice two distinct forms of\r\nstrand lines,--one the high, rocky coast cut back to cliffs by the\r\nattack of the waves, and the other the low, sandy coast where the\r\nwaves break usually upon the sand reef. To understand the origin of\r\nthese two types we must know that the meeting place of sea and land is\r\ndetermined primarily by movements of the earth's crust. Where a coast\r\nland emerges the--shore line moves seaward; where it is being\r\nsubmerged the shore line advances on the land.\r\n\r\n=Shores of elevation.= The retreat of the sea, either because of a\r\nlocal uplift of the land or for any other reason, such as the lowering\r\nof any portion of ocean bottom, lays bare the inner margin of the sea\r\nfloor. Where the sea floor has long received the waste of the land it\r\nhas been built up to a smooth, subaqueous plain, gently shelving from\r\nthe land. Since the new shore line is drawn across this even surface\r\nit is simple and regular, and is bordered on the one side by shallow\r\nwater gradually deepening seaward, and on the other by low land\r\ncomposed of material which has not yet thoroughly consolidated to firm\r\nrock. A sand reef is soon beaten up by the waves, and for some time\r\nconditions will favor its growth. The loss of sand driven into the\r\nlagoon beyond, and of that ground to powder by the surf and carried\r\nout to sea, is more than made up by the stream of alongshore drift,\r\nand especially by the drag of sediments to the reef by the waves as\r\nthey deepen the sea floor on its seaward side.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the lagoon gradually fills with waste from the reef and from\r\nthe land. It is invaded by various grasses and reeds which have\r\nlearned to grow in salt and brackish water; the marsh, laid bare only\r\nat low tide, is built above high tide by wind drift and vegetable\r\ndeposits, and becomes a meadow, soldering the sand reef to the\r\nmainland.\r\n\r\nWhile the lagoon has been filling, the waves have been so deepening\r\nthe sea floor off the sand reef that at last they are able to attack\r\nit vigorously. They now wear it back, and, driving the shore line\r\nacross the lagoon or meadow, cut a line of low cliffs on the mainland.\r\nSuch a shore is that of Gascony in southwestern France,--a low,\r\nstraight, sandy shore, bordered by dunes and unprotected by reefs from\r\nthe attack of the waves of the Bay of Biscay.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 145. Map of New Jersey, with that Portion of\r\n      the State one Hundred Feet and more above Sea Level shaded\r\n\r\n   Describe the coast line which the state would have if depressed\r\n   one hundred feet. Compare it with the present coastline]\r\n\r\nWe may say, then, that on shores of elevation the presence of sand\r\nreefs and lagoons indicates the stage of youth, while the absence of\r\nthese features and the vigorous and unimpeded attack by the sea upon\r\nthe mainland indicate the stage of maturity. Where much waste is\r\nbrought in by rivers the maturity of such a coast may be long delayed.\r\nThe waste from the land keeps the sea shallow offshore and constantly\r\nrenews the sand reef. The energy of the waves is consumed in handling\r\nshore drift, and no energy is left for an effective attack upon the\r\nland. Indeed, with an excessive amount of waste brought down by\r\nstreams the land may be built out and encroach temporarily upon the\r\nsea; and not until long denudation has lowered the land, and thus\r\ndecreased the amount of waste from it, may the waves be able to cut\r\nthrough the sand reef and thus the coast reach maturity.\r\n\r\n\r\nShores of Depression\r\n\r\nWhere a coastal region is undergoing submergence the shore line moves\r\nlandward. The horizontal plane of the sea now intersects an old land\r\nsurface roughened by subaërial denudation. The shore line is irregular\r\nand indented in proportion to the relief of the land and the amount of\r\nthe submergence which the land has suffered. It follows up partially\r\nsubmerged valleys, forming bays, and bends round the divides, leaving\r\nthem to project as promontories and peninsulas. The outlines of shores\r\nof depression are as varied as are the forms of the land partially\r\nsubmerged. We give a few typical illustrations.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 146. Chesapeake Bay\r\n\r\n   Draw a sketch of this area before its depression]\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of the coast of Maine are due chiefly to the fact\r\nthat a mountainous region of hard rocks, once worn to a peneplain, and\r\nafter a subsequent elevation deeply dissected by north-south valleys,\r\nhas subsided, the depression amounting on its southern margin to as\r\nmuch as six hundred feet below sea level. Drowned valleys penetrate\r\nthe land in long, narrow bays, and rugged divides project in long,\r\nnarrow land arms prolonged seaward by islands representing the high\r\nportions of their extremities. Of this exceedingly ragged shore there\r\nare said to be two thousand miles from the New Brunswick boundary as\r\nfar west as Portland,--a straight-line distance of but two hundred\r\nmiles. Since the time of its greatest depression the land is known to\r\nhave risen some three hundred feet; for the bays have been shortened,\r\nand the waste with which their floors were strewn is now in part laid\r\nbare as clay plains about the bay heads and in narrow selvages about\r\nthe peninsulas and islands.\r\n\r\nThe coast of Dalmatia, on the Adriatic Sea, is characterized by long\r\nland arms and chains of long and narrow islands, all parallel to the\r\ntrend of the coast. A region of parallel mountain ranges has been\r\ndepressed, and the longitudinal valleys which lie between them are\r\noccupied by arms of the sea.\r\n\r\nChesapeake Bay is a branching bay due to the depression of an ancient\r\ncoastal plain which, after having emerged from the sea, was channeled\r\nwith broad, shallow valleys. The sea has invaded the valley of the\r\ntrunk stream and those of its tributaries, forming a shallow bay whose\r\nmany branches are all directed toward its axis (Fig. 146).\r\n\r\nHudson Bay, and the North, the Baltic, and the Yellow seas are\r\nexamples where the sinking of the land has brought the sea in over low\r\nplains of large extent, thus deeply indenting the continental\r\noutline. The rise of a few hundred feet would restore these submerged\r\nplains to the land.\r\n\r\n=The cycle of shores of depression.= In its _infantile stage_ the\r\noutline of a shore of depression depends almost wholly on the previous\r\nrelief of the land, and but little on erosion by the sea. Sea cliffs\r\nand narrow benches appear where headlands and outlying islands have\r\nbeen nipped by the waves. As yet, little shore waste has been formed.\r\nThe coast of Maine is an example of this stage.\r\n\r\nIn _early youth_ all promontories have been strongly cliffed, and under\r\na vigorous attack of the sea the shore of open bays may be cut back\r\nalso. Sea stacks and rocky islets, caves and coves, make the shore\r\nminutely ragged. The irregularity of the coast, due to depression, is\r\nfor a while increased by differential wave wear on harder and softer\r\nrocks. The rock bench is still narrow. Shore waste, though being\r\nproduced in large amounts, is for the most part swept into deeper\r\nwater and buried out of sight. Examples of this stage are the east\r\ncoast of Scotland and the California coast near San Francisco.\r\n\r\n_Later youth_ is characterized by a large accumulation of shore waste.\r\nThe rock bench has been cut back so that it now furnishes a good\r\nroadway for shore drift. The stream of alongshore drift grows larger\r\nand larger, filling the heads of the smaller bays with beaches,\r\nbuilding spits and hooks, and tying islands with sand bars to the\r\nmainland. It bridges the larger bays with bay bars, while their length\r\nis being reduced as their inclosing promontories are cut back by the\r\nwaves. Thus there comes to be a straight, continuous, and easy road,\r\nno longer interrupted by headlands and bays, for the transportation of\r\nwaste alongshore. The Baltic coast of Germany is in this stage.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 147. Portion of the Northwest Coast of France]\r\n\r\nAll this while streams have been busy filling with delta deposits the\r\nbays into which they empty. By these steps a coast gradually advances\r\nto _maturity_, the stage when the irregularities due to depression\r\nhave been effaced, when outlying islands formed by subsidence have\r\nbeen planed away, and when the shore line has been driven back behind\r\nthe former bay heads. The sea now attacks the land most effectively\r\nalong a continuous and fairly straight line of cliffs. Although the\r\nfirst effect of wave wear was to increase the irregularities of the\r\nshore, it sooner or later rectifies it, making it simple and smooth.\r\nThe northwest coast of France is often cited as an example of a coast\r\nwhich has reached this stage of development (Fig. 147).\r\n\r\nIn the _old age_ of coasts the rock bench is cut back so far that the\r\nwaves can no longer exert their full effect upon the shore. Their\r\nenergy is dissipated in moving shore drift hither and thither and in\r\nabrading the bench when they drag bottom upon it. Little by little the\r\nbench is deepened by tidal currents and the drag of waves; but this\r\nprocess is so slow that meanwhile the sea cliffs melt down under the\r\nweather, and the bench becomes a broad shoal where waves and tides\r\ngradually work over the waste from the land to greater fineness and\r\nsweep it out to sea.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 148. The South Shore of Martha's Vineyard\r\n\r\n   The land is shaded. To what class of coasts does this belong?\r\n   What stage has it reached, and by what process? What changes\r\n   will take place in the future?]\r\n\r\n=Plains of marine abrasion.= While subaërial denudation reduces the\r\nland to baselevel, the sea is sawing its edges to _wave base_, i.e.\r\nthe lowest limit of the wave's effective wear. The widened rock bench\r\nforms when uplifted a plain of marine abrasion, which like the\r\npeneplain bevels across strata regardless of their various\r\ninclinations and various degrees of hardness.\r\n\r\nHow may a plain of marine abrasion be expected to differ from a\r\npeneplain in its mantle of waste?\r\n\r\nCompared with subaërial denudation, marine abrasion is a comparatively\r\nfeeble agent. At the rate of five feet per century--a higher rate than\r\nobtains on the youthful rocky, coast of Britain--it would require more\r\nthan ten million years to pare a strip one hundred miles wide from the\r\nmargin of a continent, a time sufficient, at the rate at which the\r\nMississippi valley is now being worn away, for subaërial denudation to\r\nlower the lands of the globe to the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nSlow submergence favors the cutting of a wide rock bench. The water\r\ncontinually deepens upon the bench; storm waves can therefore always\r\nride in to the base of the cliffs and attack them with full force;\r\nshore waste cannot impede the onset of the waves, for it is\r\ncontinually washed out in deeper water below wave base.\r\n\r\n=Basal conglomerates.= As the sea marches across the land during a\r\nslow submergence, the platform is covered with sheets of sea-laid\r\nsediments. Lowest of these is a conglomerate,--the bowlder and pebble\r\nbeach, widened indefinitely by the retreat of the cliffs at whose base\r\nit was formed, and preserved by the finer deposits laid upon it in\r\nthe constantly deepening water as the land subsides. Such basal\r\nconglomerates are not uncommon among the ancient rocks of the land,\r\nand we may know them by their rounded pebbles and larger stones,\r\ncomposed of the same kind of rock as that of the abraded and evened\r\nsurface on which they lie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nOFFSHORE AND DEEP-SEA DEPOSITS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe alongshore deposits which we have now studied are the exposed edge\r\nof a vast subaqueous sheet of waste which borders the continents and\r\nextends often for as much as two or three hundred miles from land.\r\nSoundings show that offshore deposits are laid in belts parallel to\r\nthe coast, the coarsest materials lying nearest to the land and the\r\nfinest farthest out. The pebbles and gravel and the clean, coarse sand\r\nof beaches give place to broad stretches of sand, which grows finer\r\nand finer until it is succeeded by sheets of mud. Clearly there is an\r\noffshore movement of waste by which it is sorted, the coarser being\r\nsooner dropped and the finer being carried farther out.\r\n\r\n\r\nOffshore Deposits\r\n\r\nThe debris torn by waves from rocky shores is far less in amount than\r\nthe waste of the land brought down to the sea by rivers, being only\r\none thirty-third as great, according to a conservative estimate. Both\r\nmingle alongshore in all the forms of beach and bar that have been\r\ndescribed, and both are together slowly carried out to sea. On the\r\nshelving ocean floor waste is agitated by various movements of the\r\nunquiet water,--by the undertow (an outward-running bottom current\r\nnear the shore), by the ebb and flow of tides, by ocean currents where\r\nthey approach the land, and by waves and ground swells, whose effects\r\nare sometimes felt to a depth of six hundred feet. By all these means\r\nthe waste is slowly washed to and fro, and as it is thus ground finer\r\nand finer and its soluble parts are more and more dissolved, it drifts\r\nfarther and farther out from land. It is by no steady and rapid\r\nmovement that waste is swept from the shore to its final resting\r\nplace. Day after day and century after century the grains of sand and\r\nparticles of mud are shifted to and fro, winnowed and spread in\r\nlayers, which are destroyed and rebuilt again and again before they\r\nare buried safe from further disturbance.\r\n\r\nThese processes which are hidden from the eye are among the most\r\nimportant of those with which our science has to do; for it is they\r\nwhich have given shape to by far the largest part of the stratified\r\nrocks of which the land is made.\r\n\r\n=The continental delta.= This fitting term has been recently suggested\r\nfor the sheet of waste slowly accumulating along the borders of the\r\ncontinents. Within a narrow belt, which rarely exceeds two or three\r\nhundred miles, except near the mouths of muddy rivers such as the\r\nAmazon and Congo, nearly all the waste of the continent, whether worn\r\nfrom its surface by the weather, by streams, by glaciers, or by the\r\nwind, or from its edge by the chafing of the waves, comes at last to\r\nits final resting place. The agencies which spread the material of the\r\ncontinental delta grow more and more feeble as they pass into deeper\r\nand more quiet water away from shore. Coarse materials are therefore\r\nsoon dropped along narrow belts near land. Gravels and coarse sands\r\nlie in thick, wedge-shaped masses which thin out seaward rapidly and\r\ngive place to sheets of finer sand.\r\n\r\n=Sea muds.= Outermost of the sediments derived from the waste of the\r\ncontinents is a wide belt of mud; for fine clays settle so slowly,\r\neven in sea water,--whose saltness causes them to sink much faster\r\nthan they would in fresh water,--that they are wafted far before they\r\nreach a bottom where they may remain undisturbed. Muds are also found\r\nnear shore, carpeting the floors of estuaries, and among stretches of\r\nsandy deposits in hollows where the more quiet water has permitted the\r\nfiner silt to rest.\r\n\r\nSea muds are commonly bluish and consolidate to bluish shales; the red\r\ncoloring matter brought from land waste--iron oxide--is altered to\r\nother iron compounds by decomposing organic matter in the presence of\r\nsea water. Yellow and red muds occur where the amount of iron oxide in\r\nthe silt brought down to the sea by rivers is too great to be reduced,\r\nor decomposed, by the organic matter present.\r\n\r\nGreen muds and green sand owe their color to certain chemical changes\r\nwhich take place where waste from the land accumulates on the sea\r\nfloor with extreme slowness. A greenish mineral called _glauconite_--a\r\nsilicate of iron and alumina--is then formed. Such deposits, known as\r\n_green sand_, are now in process of making in several patches off the\r\nAtlantic coast, and are found on the coastal plain of New Jersey among\r\nthe offshore deposits of earlier geological ages.\r\n\r\n=Organic deposits.= Living creatures swarm along the shore and on the\r\nshallows out from land as nowhere else in the ocean. Seaweed often\r\nmantles the rock of the sea cliff between the levels of high and low\r\ntide, protecting it to some degree from the blows of waves. On the\r\nrock bench each little pool left by the ebbing tide is an aquarium\r\nabounding in the lowly forms of marine life. Below low-tide level\r\noccur beds of molluscous shells, such as the oyster, with countless\r\nnumbers of other humble organisms. Their harder parts--the shells of\r\nmollusks, the white framework of corals, the carapaces of crabs and\r\nother crustaceans, the shells of sea urchins, the bones and teeth of\r\nfishes--are gradually buried within the accumulating sheets of\r\nsediment, either whole or, far more often, broken into fragments by\r\nthe waves.\r\n\r\nBy means of these organic remains each layer of beach deposits and\r\nthose of the continental delta may contain a record of the life of the\r\ntime when it was laid. Such a record has been made ever since living\r\ncreatures with hard parts appeared upon the globe. We shall find it\r\nsealed away in the stratified rocks of the continents,--parts of\r\nancient sea deposits now raised to form the dry land. Thus we have in\r\nthe traces of living creatures found in the rocks, i.e. in fossils, a\r\nhistory of the progress of life upon the planet.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 149. Coquina, Florida]\r\n\r\n=Molluscous shell deposits.= The forms of marine life of importance in\r\nrock making thrive best in clear water, where little sediment is being\r\nlaid, and where at the same time the depth is not so great as to\r\ndeprive them of needed light, heat, and of sufficient oxygen absorbed\r\nby sea water from the air. In such clear and comparatively shallow\r\nwater there often grow countless myriads of animals, such as mollusks\r\nand corals, whose shells and skeletons of carbonate of lime gradually\r\naccumulate in beds of limestone.\r\n\r\nA shell limestone made of broken fragments cemented together is\r\nsometimes called _coquina_, a local term applied to such beds recently\r\nuplifted from the sea along the coast of Florida (Fig. 149).\r\n\r\n_Oölitic_ limestone (_öon_, an egg; _lithos_, a stone) is so named\r\nfrom the likeness of the tiny spherules which compose it to the roe of\r\nfish. Corals and shells have been pounded by the waves to calcareous\r\nsand, and each grain has been covered with successive concentric\r\ncoatings of lime carbonate deposited about it from solution.\r\n\r\nThe impalpable powder to which calcareous sand is ground by the waves\r\nsettles at some distance from shore in deeper and quieter water as a\r\nlimy silt, and hardens into a dense, fine-grained limestone in which\r\nperhaps no trace of fossil is found to suggest the fact that it is of\r\norganic origin.\r\n\r\nFrom Florida Keys there extends south to the trough of Florida Straits\r\na limestone bank covered by from five hundred and forty to eighteen\r\nhundred feet of water. The rocky bottom consists of limestone now\r\nslowly building from the accumulation of the remains of mollusks,\r\nsmall corals, sea urchins, worms with calcareous tubes, and\r\nlime-secreting seaweed, which live upon its surface.\r\n\r\nWhere sponges and other silica-secreting organisms abound on limestone\r\nbanks, silica forms part of the accumulated deposit, either in its\r\noriginal condition, as, for example, the spicules of sponges, or\r\ngathered into concretions and layers of flint.\r\n\r\nWhere considerable mud is being deposited along with carbonate of lime\r\nthere is in process of making a clayey limestone or a limy shale;\r\nwhere considerable sand, a sandy limestone or a limy sandstone.\r\n\r\n=Consolidation of offshore deposits.= We cannot doubt that all these\r\nloose sediments of the sea floor are being slowly consolidated to\r\nsolid rock. They are soaked with water which carries in solution lime\r\ncarbonate and other cementing substances. These cements are deposited\r\nbetween the fragments of shells and corals, the grains of sand and\r\nthe particles of mud, binding them together into firm rock. Where\r\nsediments have accumulated to great thickness the lower portions tend\r\nalso to consolidate under the weight of the overlying beds. Except in\r\nthe case of limestones, recent sea deposits uplifted to form land are\r\nseldom so well cemented as are the older strata, which have long been\r\nacted upon by underground waters deep below the surface within the\r\nzone of cementation, and have been exposed to view by great erosion.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 150. Ripple Marks on Layers of Ancient\r\n      Sandstone, Wisconsin]\r\n\r\n=Ripple marks, sun cracks, etc.= The pulse of waves and tidal currents\r\nagitates the loose material of offshore deposits, throwing it into\r\nfine parallel ridges called ripple marks. One may see this beautiful\r\nribbing imprinted on beach sands uncovered by the outgoing tide, and\r\nit is also produced where the water is of considerable depth. While\r\nthe tide is out the surface of shore deposits may be marked by the\r\nfootprints of birds and other animals, or by the raindrops of a\r\npassing shower (Fig. 153). The mud of flats, thus exposed to the sun\r\nand dried, cracks in a characteristic way (Figs. 151 and 152). Such\r\nmarkings may be covered over with a thin layer of sediment at the next\r\nflood tide and sealed away as a lasting record of the manner and place\r\nin which the strata were laid. In Figure 150 we have an illustration\r\nof a very ancient ripple-marked sand consolidated to hard stone,\r\nuplifted and set on edge by movements of the earth's crust, and\r\nexposed to open air after long erosion.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 151. Sun Cracks]\r\n\r\n=Stratification.= For the most part the sheet of sea-laid waste is\r\nhidden from our sight. Where its edge is exposed along the shore we\r\nmay see the surface markings which have just been noticed. Soundings\r\nalso, and the observations made in shallow waters by divers, tell\r\nsomething of its surface; but to learn more of its structures we must\r\nstudy those ancient sediments which have been lifted from the sea and\r\ndissected by subaërial agencies. From them we ascertain that sea\r\ndeposits are stratified. They lie in distinct layers which often\r\ndiffer from one another in thickness, in size of particles, and\r\nperhaps in color. They are parted by bedding planes, each of which\r\nrepresents either a change in material or a pause during which\r\ndeposition ceased and the material of one layer had time to settle and\r\nbecome somewhat consolidated before the material of the next was laid\r\nupon it. Stratification is thus due to intermittently acting forces,\r\nsuch as the agitation of the water during storms, the flow and ebb of\r\nthe tide, and the shifting channels of tidal currents. Off the mouths\r\nof rivers, stratification is also caused by the coarser and more\r\nabundant material brought down at time of floods being laid on the\r\nfiner silt which is discharged during ordinary stages.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 152. The Under Side of a Layer deposited\r\n      upon a Sun-Cracked Surface, showing Casts of the Cracks]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 153. Rain Prints]\r\n\r\nHow stratified deposits are built up is well illustrated in the flats\r\nwhich border estuaries, such as the Bay of Fundy. Each advance of the\r\ntide spreads a film of mud, which dries and hardens in the air during\r\nlow water before another film is laid upon it by the next incoming\r\ntidal flood. In this way the flats have been covered by a clay which\r\nsplits into leaves as thin as sheets of paper.\r\n\r\nIt is in fine material, such as clays and shales and limestones, that\r\nthe thinnest and most uniform layers, as well as those of widest\r\nextent, occur. On the other hand, coarse materials are commonly laid\r\nin thick beds, which soon thin out seaward and give place to deposits\r\nof finer stuff. In a general way strata are laid in well-nigh\r\nhorizontal sheets, for the surface on which they are laid is generally\r\nof very gentle inclination. Each stratum, however, is lenticular, or\r\nlenslike, in form, having an area where it is thickest, and thinning\r\nout thence to its edges, where it is overlapped by strata similar in\r\nshape.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 154. Cross Bedding in Sandstone, England]\r\n\r\n=Cross bedding.= There is an apparent exception to this rule where\r\nstrata whose upper and lower surfaces may be about horizontal are made\r\nup of layers inclined at angles which may be as high as the angle of\r\nrepose. In this case each stratum grew by the addition along its edge\r\nof successive layers of sediment, precisely as does a sand bar in a\r\nriver, the sand being pushed continuously over the edge and coming to\r\nrest on a sloping surface. Shoals built by strong and shifting tidal\r\ncurrents often show successive strata in which the cross bedding is\r\ninclined in different directions.\r\n\r\n=Thickness of sea deposits.= Remembering the vast amount of material\r\ndenuded from the land and deposited offshore, we should expect that\r\nwith the lapse of time sea deposits would have grown to an enormous\r\nthickness. It is a suggestive fact that, as a rule, the profile of the\r\nocean bed is that of a soup plate,--a basin surrounded by a flaring\r\nrim. On the _continental shelf_, as the rim is called, the water is\r\nseldom more than six hundred feet in depth at the outer edge, and\r\nshallows gradually towards shore. Along the eastern coast of the\r\nUnited States the continental shelf is from fifty to one hundred and\r\nmore miles in width; on the Pacific coast it is much narrower. So far\r\nas it is due to upbuilding, a wide continental shelf, such as that of\r\nthe Atlantic coast, implies a massive continental delta thousands of\r\nfeet in thickness. The coastal plain of the Atlantic states may be\r\nregarded as the emerged inner margin of this shelf, and borings made\r\nalong the coast probe it to the depth of as much as three thousand\r\nfeet without finding the bottom of ancient offshore deposits.\r\nContinental shelves may also be due in part to a submergence of the\r\nouter margin of a continental plateau and to marine abrasion.\r\n\r\n=Deposition of sediments and subsidence.= The stratified rocks of the\r\nland show in many places ancient sediments which reach a thickness\r\nwhich is measured in miles, and which are yet the product of well-nigh\r\ncontinuous deposition. Such strata may prove by their fossils and by\r\ntheir composition and structure that they were all laid offshore in\r\nshallow water. We must infer that, during the vast length of time\r\nrecorded by the enormous pile, the floor of the sea along the coast\r\nwas slowly sinking, and that the trough was constantly being filled,\r\nfoot by foot, as fast as it was depressed. Such gradual, quiet\r\nmovements of the earth's crust not only modify the outline of coasts,\r\nas we have seen, but are of far greater geological importance in that\r\nthey permit the making of immense deposits of stratified rock.\r\n\r\nA slow subsidence continued during long time is recorded also in the\r\nsuccession of the various kinds of rock that come to be deposited in\r\nthe same area. As the sea transgresses the land, i.e. encroaches upon\r\nit, any given part of the sea bottom is brought farther and farther\r\nfrom the shore. The basal conglomerate formed by bowlder and pebble\r\nbeaches comes to be covered with sheets of sand, and these with layers\r\nof mud as the sea becomes deeper and the shore more remote; while\r\ndeposits of limestone are made when at last no waste is brought to the\r\nplace from the now distant land, and the water is left clear for the\r\ngrowth of mollusks and other lime-secreting organisms.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 155. Succession of Deposits recording a\r\n      Transgressing Sea\r\n\r\n   _c_, conglomerate; _ss_, sandstone; _sh_, shale; _lm_, limestone]\r\n\r\n=Rate of deposition.= As deposition in the sea corresponds to\r\ndenudation on the land, we are able to make a general estimate of the\r\nrate at which the former process is going on. Leaving out of account\r\nthe soluble matter removed, the Mississippi is lowering its basin at\r\nthe rate of one foot in five thousand years, and we may assume this as\r\nthe average rate at which the earth's land surface of fifty-seven\r\nmillion square miles is now being denuded by the removal of its\r\nmechanical waste. But sediments from the land are spread within a zone\r\nbut two or three hundred miles in width along the margin of the\r\ncontinents, a line one hundred thousand miles long. As the area of\r\ndeposition--about twenty-five million square miles--is about one half\r\nthe area of denudation, the average rate of deposition must be twice\r\nthe average rate of denudation, i.e. about one foot in twenty-five\r\nhundred years. If some deposits are made much more rapidly than this,\r\nothers are made much more slowly. If they were laid no faster than the\r\npresent average rate, the strata of ancient sea deposits exposed in a\r\nquarry fifty feet deep represent a lapse of at least one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five thousand years, and those of a formation five hundred feet\r\nthick required for their accumulation one million two hundred and\r\nfifty thousand years.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 156. Thick Offshore Deposits of Coarse Waste\r\n      recording the Presence of a Young Mountain Range near Shore]\r\n\r\n=The sedimentary record and the denudation cycle.= We have seen that\r\nthe successive stages in a cycle of denudation, such as that by which\r\na land mass of lofty mountains is worn to low plains, are marked each\r\nby its own peculiar land forms, and that the forms of the earlier\r\nstages are more or less completely effaced as the cycle draws toward\r\nan end. Far more lasting records of each stage are left in the\r\nsedimentary deposits of the continental delta. Thus, in the youth of\r\nsuch a land mass as we have mentioned, torrential streams flowing down\r\nthe steep mountain sides deliver to the adjacent sea their heavy loads\r\nof coarse waste, and thick offshore deposits of sand and gravel (Fig.\r\n156) record the high elevation of the bordering land. As the land is\r\nworn to lower levels, the amount and coarseness of the waste brought\r\nto the sea diminishes, until the sluggish streams carry only a fine\r\nsilt which settles on the ocean floor near to land in wide sheets of\r\nmud which harden into shale. At last, in the old age of the region\r\n(Fig. 157), its low plains contribute little to the sea except the\r\nsoluble elements of the rocks, and in the clear waters near the land\r\nlime-secreting organisms flourish and their remains accumulate in beds\r\nof limestone. When long-weathered lands mantled with deep,\r\nwell-oxidized waste are uplifted by a gradual movement of the earth's\r\ncrust, and the mantle is rapidly stripped off by the revived streams,\r\nthe uprise is recorded in wide deposits of red and yellow clays and\r\nsands upon the adjacent ocean floor.\r\n\r\nWhere the waste brought in is more than the waves can easily\r\ndistribute, as off the mouths of turbid rivers which drain highlands\r\nnear the sea, deposits are little winnowed, and are laid in rapidly\r\nalternating, shaly sandstones and sandy shales.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 157. Offshore Deposits recording Old Age of\r\n      the Adjacent Land\r\n\r\n   _ss_, sandstone; _sh_, shale; _lm_, limestone]\r\n\r\nWhere the highlands are of igneous rock, such as granite, and\r\nmechanical disintegration is going on more rapidly than chemical\r\ndecay, these conditions are recorded in the nature of the deposits\r\nlaid offshore. The waste swept in by streams contains much feldspar\r\nand other minerals softer and more soluble than quartz, and where the\r\nwaves have little opportunity to wear and winnow it, it comes to rest\r\nin beds of sandstone in which grains of feldspar and other soft\r\nminerals are abundant. Such feldspathic sandstones are known as\r\n_arkose_.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, where the waste supplied to the sea comes chiefly\r\nfrom wide, sandy, coastal plains, there are deposited offshore clean\r\nsandstones of well-worn grains of quartz alone. In such coastal plains\r\nthe waste of the land is stored for ages. Again and again they are\r\nabandoned and invaded by the sea as from time to time the land slowly\r\nemerges and is again submerged. Their deposits are long exposed to the\r\nweather, and sorted over by the streams, and winnowed and worked over\r\nagain and again by the waves. In the course of long ages such deposits\r\nthus become thoroughly sorted, and the grains of all minerals softer\r\nthan quartz are ground to mud.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 158. Globigerina Ooze under the Microscope]\r\n\r\n\r\nDeep-Sea Oozes and Clays\r\n\r\n=Globigerina ooze.= Beyond the reach of waste from the land the bottom\r\nof the deep sea is carpeted for the most part with either chalky ooze\r\nor a fine red clay. The surface waters of the warm seas swarm with\r\nminute and lowly animals belonging to the order of the _Foraminifera_,\r\nwhich secrete shells of carbonate of lime. At death these tiny white\r\nshells fall through the sea water like snowflakes in the air, and,\r\nslowly dissolving, seem to melt quite away before they can reach\r\ndepths greater than about three miles. Near shore they reach bottom,\r\nbut are masked by the rapid deposit of waste derived from the land. At\r\nintermediate depths they mantle the ocean floor with a white, soft\r\nlime deposit known as _Globigerina ooze_, from a genus of the\r\nForaminifera which contributes largely to its formation.\r\n\r\n=Red clay.= Below depths of from fifteen to eighteen thousand feet the\r\nocean bottom is sheeted with red or chocolate colored clay. It is the\r\ninsoluble residue of seashells, of the debris of submarine volcanic\r\neruptions, of volcanic dust wafted by the winds, and of pieces of\r\npumice drifted by ocean currents far from the volcanoes from which\r\nthey were hurled. The red clay builds up with such inconceivable\r\nslowness that the teeth of sharks and the hard ear bones of whales may\r\nbe dredged in large numbers from the deep ocean bed, where they have\r\nlain unburied for thousands of years; and an appreciable part of the\r\nclay is also formed by the dust of meteorites consumed in the\r\natmosphere,--a dust which falls everywhere on sea and land, but which\r\nelsewhere is wholly masked by other deposits.\r\n\r\nThe dark, cold abysses of the ocean are far less affected by change\r\nthan any other portion of the surface of the lithosphere. These vast,\r\nsilent plains of ooze lie far below the reach of storms. They know no\r\nsuccession of summer and winter, or of night and day. A mantle of deep\r\nand quiet water protects them from the agents of erosion which\r\ncontinually attack, furrow, and destroy the surface of the land. While\r\nthe land is the area of erosion, the sea is the area of deposition.\r\nThe sheets of sediment which are slowly spread there tend to efface\r\nany inequalities, and to form a smooth and featureless subaqueous\r\nplain.\r\n\r\nWith few exceptions, the stratified rocks of the land are proved by\r\ntheir fossils and composition to have been laid in the sea; but in the\r\nsame way they are proved to be offshore, shallow-water deposits, akin\r\nto those now making on continental shelves. Deep-sea deposits are\r\nabsent from the rocks of the land, and we may therefore infer that the\r\ndeep sea has never held sway where the continents now are,--that the\r\ncontinents have ever been, as now, the elevated portions of the\r\nlithosphere, and that the deep seas of the present have ever been its\r\nmost depressed portions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Reef-Building Corals\r\n\r\nIn warm seas the most conspicuous of rock-making organisms are the\r\ncorals known as the reef builders. Floating in a boat over a coral\r\nreef, as, for example, off the south coast of Florida or among the\r\nBahamas, one looks down through clear water on thickets of branching\r\ncoral shrubs perhaps as much as eight feet high, and hemispherical\r\nmasses three or four feet thick, all abloom with countless minute\r\nflowerlike coral polyps, gorgeous in their colors of yellow, orange,\r\ngreen, and red. In structure each tiny polyp is little more than a\r\nfleshy sac whose mouth is surrounded with petal-like tentacles, or\r\nfeelers. From the sea water the polyps secrete calcium carbonate and\r\nbuild it up into the stony framework which supports their colonies.\r\nBoring mollusks, worms, and sponges perforate and honeycomb this\r\nframework even while its surface is covered with myriads of living\r\npolyps. It is thus easily broken by the waves, and white fragments of\r\ncoral trees strew the ground beneath. Brilliantly colored fishes live\r\nin these coral groves, and countless mollusks, sea urchins, and other\r\nforms of marine life make here their home. With the debris from all\r\nthese sources the reef is constantly built up until it rises to\r\nlow-tide level. Higher than this the corals cannot grow, since they\r\nare killed by a few hours' exposure to the air.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 159. Patch of Growing Corals exposed at an\r\n      Exceptionally Low Tide, Great Barrier Reef, Australia]\r\n\r\nWhen the reef has risen to wave base, the waves abrade it on the\r\nwindward side and pile to leeward coral blocks torn from their\r\nfoundation, filling the interstices with finer fragments. Thus they\r\nheap up along the reef low, narrow islands (Fig. 160).\r\n\r\nReef building is a comparatively rapid progress. It has been estimated\r\nthat off Florida a reef could be built up to the surface from a depth\r\nof fifty feet in about fifteen hundred years.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 160. Wave-Built Island on Coral Reef\r\n\r\n   _r_, reef; _sl_, sea level]\r\n\r\n=Coral limestones.= Limestones of various kinds are due to the reef\r\nbuilders. The reef rock is made of corals in place and broken\r\nfragments of all sizes, cemented together with calcium carbonate from\r\nsolution by infiltrating waters. On the island beaches coral sand is\r\nforming oolitic limestone, and the white coral mud with which the sea\r\nis milky for miles about the reef in times of storm settles and\r\nconcretes into a compact limestone of finest grain. Corals have been\r\namong the most important limestone builders of the sea ever since they\r\nmade their appearance in the early geological ages.\r\n\r\nThe areas on which coral limestone is now forming are large. The Great\r\nBarrier Reef of Australia, which lies off the northeastern coast, is\r\ntwelve hundred and fifty miles long, and has a width of from ten to\r\nninety miles. Most of the islands of the tropics are either skirted\r\nwith coral reefs or are themselves of coral formation.\r\n\r\n=Conditions of coral growth.= Reef-building corals cannot live except\r\nin clear salt water less, as a rule, than one hundred and fifty feet\r\nin depth, with a winter temperature not lower than 68° F. An important\r\ncondition also is an abundant food supply, and this is best secured in\r\nthe path of the warm oceanic currents.\r\n\r\nCoral reefs may be grouped in three classes,--fringing reefs, barrier\r\nreefs, and atolls.\r\n\r\n=Fringing reefs.= These take their name from the fact that they are\r\nattached as narrow fringes to the shore. An example is the reef which\r\nforms a selvage about a mile wide along the northeastern coast of\r\nCuba. The outer margin, indicated by the line of white surf, where the\r\ncorals are in vigorous growth, rises from about forty feet of water.\r\nBetween this and the shore lies a stretch of shoal across which one\r\ncan wade at low water, composed of coral sand with here and there a\r\nclump of growing coral.\r\n\r\n=Barrier reefs.= Reefs separated from the shore by a ship channel of\r\nquiet water, often several miles in width and sometimes as much as\r\nthree hundred feet in depth, are known as barrier reefs. The seaward\r\nface rises abruptly from water too deep for coral growth. Low islands\r\nare cast up by the waves upon the reef, and inlets give place for the\r\nebb and flow of the tides. Along the west coast of the island of New\r\nCaledonia a barrier reef extends for four hundred miles, and for a\r\nlength of many leagues seldom approaches within eight miles of the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n=Atolls.= These are ring-shaped or irregular coral islands, or\r\nisland-studded reefs, inclosing a central lagoon. The narrow zone of\r\nland, like the rim of a great bowl sunken to the water's edge, rises\r\nhardly more than twenty feet at most above the sea, and is covered\r\nwith a forest of trees such as the cocoanut, whose seeds can be\r\ndrifted to it uninjured from long distances. The white beach of coral\r\nsand leads down to the growing reef, on whose outer margin the surf is\r\nconstantly breaking. The sea face of the reef falls off abruptly,\r\noften to depths of thousands of feet, while the lagoon varies in depth\r\nfrom a few feet to one hundred and fifty or two hundred, and\r\nexceptionally measures as much as three hundred and fifty feet.\r\n\r\n=Theories of coral reefs.= Fringing reefs require no explanation,\r\nsince the depth of water about them is not greater than that at which\r\ncoral can grow; but barrier reefs and atolls, which may rise from\r\ndepths too great for coral growth demand a theory of their origin.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 161. Diagram illustrating the Subsidence\r\n      Theory of Coral Reefs]\r\n\r\nDarwin's theory holds that barrier reefs and atolls are formed from\r\nfringing reefs by _subsidence_. The rate of sinking cannot be greater\r\nthan that of the upbuilding of the reef, since otherwise the corals\r\nwould be carried below their depth and drowned. The process is\r\nillustrated in Figure 161, where v represents a volcanic island in mid\r\nocean undergoing slow depression, and _ss_ the sea level before the\r\nsinking began, when the island was surrounded by a fringing reef. As\r\nthe island slowly sinks, the reef builds up with equal pace. It rears\r\nits seaward face more steep than the island slope, and thus the\r\nintervening space between the sinking, narrowing land and the outer\r\nmargin of the reef constantly widens. In this intervening space the\r\ncorals are more or less smothered with silt from the outer reef and\r\nfrom the land, and are also deprived in large measure of the needful\r\nsupply of food and oxygen by the vigorous growth of the corals on the\r\nouter rim. The outer rim thus becomes a barrier reef and the inner\r\nbelt of retarded growth is deepened by subsidence to a ship channel,\r\n_s´s´_ representing sea level at this time. The final stage, where the\r\nisland has been carried completely beneath the sea and overgrown by\r\nthe contracting reef, whose outer ring now forms an atoll, is\r\nrepresented by _s´´s´´_.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 162. Barrier Reef formed without Subsidence\r\n\r\n   _a_, zone of coral growth; _f_, former fringing reef; _t_,\r\n   talus; _b_, barrier reef]\r\n\r\nIn very many instances, however, atolls and barrier reefs may be\r\nexplained without subsidence. Thus a barrier reef may be formed by the\r\nseaward growth of a fringing reef upon the talus of its sea face. In\r\nFigure 162, _f_ is a fringing reef whose outer wall rises from about\r\none hundred and fifty feet, the lower limit of the reef-building\r\nspecies. At the foot of this submarine cliff a talus of fallen blocks\r\nt accumulates, and as it reaches the zone of coral growth becomes the\r\nfoundation on which the reef is steadily extended seaward. As the reef\r\nwidens, the polyps of the circumference flourish, while those of the\r\ninner belt are retarded in their growth and at last perish. The coral\r\nrock of the inner belt is now dissolved by sea water and scoured out\r\nby tidal currents until it gives place to a gradually deepening ship\r\nchannel, while the outer margin is left as a barrier reef.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 163. Section of Atoll on a Shoal which has\r\n      been built up to near the Surface by Organic Deposits upon a\r\n      Submarine Volcanic Peak\r\n\r\n   _v_, volcano; _f_, foraminiferal deposits; _m_, molluscous shell\r\n   deposits; _c_, coral reef; _sl_, sea level]\r\n\r\nIn much the same way atolls may be built on any shoal which lies\r\nwithin the zone of coral growth. Such shoals may be produced when\r\nvolcanic islands are leveled by waves and ocean currents, and when\r\nsubmarine plateaus, ridges, and peaks are built up by various organic\r\nagencies, such as molluscous and foraminiferal shell deposits (Fig.\r\n163). The reef-building corals, whose eggs are drifted widely over the\r\ntropic seas by ocean currents, colonize such submarine foundations\r\nwherever the conditions are favorable for their growth. As the reef\r\napproaches the surface the corals of the inner area are smothered by\r\nsilt and starved, and their Submarine Volcanic Peak hard parts are\r\ndissolved and scoured away; while those of the circumference, with\r\nabundant food supply, nourish and build the ring of the atoll. Atolls\r\nmay be produced also by the backward drift of sand from either end of\r\na crescentic coral reef or island, the spits uniting in the quiet\r\nwater of the lee to inclose a lagoon. In the Maldive Archipelago all\r\ngradations between crescent-shaped islets and complete atoll rings\r\nhave been observed.\r\n\r\nIn a number of instances where coral reefs have been raised by\r\nmovements of the earth's crust, the reef formation is found to be a\r\nthin veneer built upon a foundation of other deposits. Thus Christmas\r\nIsland, in the Indian Ocean, is a volcanic pile rising eleven hundred\r\nfeet above sea level and fifteen thousand five hundred feet above the\r\nbottom of the sea. The summit is a plateau surrounded by a rim of\r\nhills of reef formation, which represent the ring of islets of an\r\nancient atoll. Beneath the reef are thick beds of limestone, composed\r\nlargely of the remains of foraminifers, which cover the lavas and\r\nfragmental materials of the old submarine volcano.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient sediments which now form the stratified rocks of the\r\nland there occur many thin reef deposits, but none are known of the\r\nimmense thickness which modern reefs are supposed to reach according\r\nto the theory of subsidence.\r\n\r\nBarrier and fringing reefs are commonly interrupted off the mouths of\r\nrivers. Why?\r\n\r\n=Summary.= We have seen that the ocean bed is the goal to which the\r\nwaste of the rocks of the land at last arrives. Their soluble parts,\r\ndissolved by underground waters and carried to the sea by rivers, are\r\nlargely built up by living creatures into vast sheets of limestone.\r\nThe less soluble portions--the waste brought in by streams and the\r\nwaste of the shore--form the muds and sands of continental deltas. All\r\nof these sea deposits consolidate and harden, and the coherent rocks\r\nof the land are thus reconstructed on the ocean floor. But the\r\ndestination is not a final one. The stratified rocks of the land are\r\nfor the most part ancient deposits of the sea, which have been lifted\r\nabove sea level; and we may believe that the sediments now being laid\r\noffshore are the \"dust of continents to be,\" and will some time emerge\r\nto form additions to the land. We are now to study the movements of\r\nthe earth's crust which restore the sediments of the sea to the light\r\nof day, and to whose beneficence we owe the habitable lands of the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nINTERNAL GEOLOGICAL AGENCIES\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nMOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH'S CRUST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe geological agencies which we have so far studied--weathering,\r\nstreams, underground waters, glaciers, winds, and the ocean--all work\r\nupon the earth from without, and all are set in motion by an energy\r\nexternal to the earth, namely, the radiant energy of the sun. All,\r\ntoo, have a common tendency to reduce the inequalities of the earth's\r\nsurface by leveling the lands and strewing their waste beneath the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nBut despite the unceasing efforts of these external agencies, they\r\nhave not destroyed the continents, which still rear their broad plains\r\nand great plateaus and mountain ranges above the sea. Either, then,\r\nthe earth is very young and the agents of denudation have not yet had\r\ntime to do their work, or they have been opposed successfully by other\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nWe enter now upon a department of our science which treats of forces\r\nwhich work upon the earth from within, and increase the inequalities\r\nof its surface. It is they which uplift and recreate the lands which\r\nthe agents of denudation are continually destroying; it is they which\r\ndeepen the ocean bed and thus withdraw its waters from the shores. At\r\ntimes also these forces have aided in the destruction of the lands by\r\ngradually lowering them and bringing in the sea. Under the action of\r\nforces resident within the earth the crust slowly rises or sinks; from\r\ntime to time it has been folded and broken; while vast quantities of\r\nmolten rock have been pressed up into it from beneath and outpoured\r\nupon its surface. We shall take up these phenomena in the following\r\nchapters, which treat of upheavals and depressions of the crust,\r\nfoldings and fractures of the crust, earthquakes, volcanoes, the\r\ninterior conditions of the earth, mineral veins, and metamorphism.\r\n\r\n\r\nOscillations of the Crust\r\n\r\nOf the various movements of the crust due to internal agencies we will\r\nconsider first those called oscillations, which lift or depress large\r\nareas so slowly that a long time is needed to produce perceptible\r\nchanges of level, and which leave the strata in nearly their original\r\nhorizontal attitude. These movements are most conspicuous along\r\ncoasts, where they can be referred to the datum plane of sea level; we\r\nwill therefore take our first illustrations from rising and sinking\r\nshores.\r\n\r\n=New Jersey.= Along the coasts of New Jersey one may find awash at\r\nhigh tide ancient shell heaps, the remains of tribal feasts of\r\naborigines. Meadows and old forest grounds, with the stumps still\r\nstanding, are now overflowed by the sea, and fragments of their turf\r\nand wood are brought to shore by waves. Assuming that the sea level\r\nremains constant, it is clear that the New Jersey coast is now\r\ngradually sinking. The rate of submergence has been estimated at about\r\ntwo feet per century.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the wide coastal plain of New Jersey is made of\r\nstratified sands and clays, which, as their marine fossils show, were\r\noutspread beneath the sea. Their present position above sea level\r\nproves that the land now subsiding emerged in the recent past.\r\n\r\nThe coast of New Jersey is an example of the slow and tranquil\r\noscillations of the earth's unstable crust now in progress along many\r\nshores. Some are emerging from the sea, some are sinking beneath it;\r\nand no part of the land seems to have been exempt from these changes\r\nin the past.\r\n\r\n=Evidences of changes of level.= Taking the surface of the sea as a\r\nlevel of reference, we may accept as proofs of relative upheaval\r\nwhatever is now found in place above sea level and could have been\r\nformed only at or beneath it, and as proofs of relative subsidence\r\nwhatever is now found beneath the sea and could only have been formed\r\nabove it.\r\n\r\nThus old strand lines with sea cliffs, wave-cut rock benches, and\r\nbeaches of wave-worn pebbles or sand, are striking proofs of recent\r\nemergence to the amount of their present height above tide. No less\r\nconclusive is the presence of sea-laid rocks which we may find in the\r\nneighboring quarry or outcrop, although it may have been long ages\r\nsince they were lifted from the sea to form part of the dry land.\r\n\r\nAmong common proofs of subsidence are roads and buildings and other\r\nworks of man, and vegetal growths and deposits, such as forest grounds\r\nand peat beds, now submerged beneath the sea. In the deltas of many\r\nlarge rivers, such as the Po, the Nile, the Ganges, and the\r\nMississippi, buried soils prove subsidences of hundreds of feet; and\r\nin several cases, as in the Mississippi delta, the depression seems to\r\nbe now in progress.\r\n\r\nOther proofs of the same movement are drowned land forms which are\r\nmodeled only in open air. Since rivers cannot cut their valleys\r\nfarther below the baselevel of the sea than the depths of their\r\nchannels, _drowned valleys_ are among the plainest proofs of\r\ndepression. To this class belong Narragansett, Delaware, Chesapeake,\r\nMobile, and San Francisco bays, and many other similar drowned valleys\r\nalong the coasts of the United States. Less conspicuous are the\r\n_submarine channels_ which, as soundings show, extend from the mouths\r\nof a number of rivers some distance out to sea. Such is the submerged\r\nchannel which reaches from New York Bay southeast to the edge of the\r\ncontinental shelf, and which is supposed to have been cut by the\r\nHudson River when this part of the shelf was a coastal plain.\r\n\r\n=Warping.= In a region undergoing changes of level the rate of\r\nmovement commonly varies in different parts. Portions of an area may\r\nbe rising or sinking, while adjacent portions are stationary or moving\r\nin the opposite direction. In this way a land surface becomes\r\n_warped_. Thus, while Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are now rising\r\nfrom the level of the sea, Prince Edward Island and Cape Breton Island\r\nare sinking, and the sea now flows over the site of the famous old\r\ntown of Louisburg destroyed in 1758.\r\n\r\nSince the close of the glacial epoch the coasts of Newfoundland and\r\nLabrador have risen hundreds of feet, but the rate of emergence has\r\nnot been uniform. The old strand line, which stands at five hundred\r\nand seventy-five feet above tide at St. John's, Newfoundland, declines\r\nto two hundred and fifty feet near the northern point of Labrador\r\n(Fig. 164).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 164. Warped Strand Line from St. John's,\r\n      Newfoundland, to Nachvak, Labrador]\r\n\r\n=The Great Lakes= is now undergoing perceptible warping. Rivers enter\r\nthe lakes from the south and west with sluggish currents and deep\r\nchannels resembling the estuaries of drowned rivers; while those that\r\nenter from opposite directions are swift and shallow. At the western\r\nend of Lake Erie are found submerged caves containing stalactites, and\r\nold meadows and forest grounds are now under water. It is thus seen\r\nthat the water of the lakes is rising along their southwestern shores,\r\nwhile from their northeastern shores it is being withdrawn. The\r\nregion of the Great Lakes is therefore warping; it is rising in the\r\nnortheast as compared with the southwest.\r\n\r\nFrom old bench marks and records of lake levels it has been estimated\r\nthat _the rate of warping_ amounts to five inches a century for every\r\none hundred miles. It is calculated that the water of Lake Michigan is\r\nrising at Chicago at the rate of nine or ten inches per century. The\r\ndivide at this point between the tributaries of the Mississippi and\r\nLake Michigan is but eight feet above the mean stage of the lake. If\r\nthe canting of the region continues at its present rate, in a thousand\r\nyears the waters of the lake will here overflow the divide. In three\r\nthousand five hundred years all the lakes except Ontario will\r\ndischarge by this outlet, via the Illinois and Mississippi rivers,\r\ninto the Gulf of Mexico. The present outlet by the Niagara River will\r\nbe left dry, and the divide between the St. Lawrence and the\r\nMississippi systems will have shifted from Chicago to the vicinity of\r\nBuffalo.\r\n\r\n=Physiographic effects of oscillations.= We have already mentioned\r\nseveral of the most important effects of movements of elevation and\r\ndepression, such as their effects on rivers, the mantle of waste (pp.\r\n85, 86), and the forms of coasts (p. 166). Movements of\r\nelevation--including uplifts by folding and fracture of the crust to\r\nbe noticed later--are the necessary conditions for erosion by whatever\r\nagent. They determine the various agencies which are to be chiefly\r\nconcerned m the wear of any land,--whether streams or glaciers,\r\nweathering or the wind,--and the degree of their efficiency. The lands\r\nmust be uplifted before they can be eroded, and since they must be\r\neroded before their waste can be deposited, movements of elevation are\r\na prerequisite condition for sedimentation also. Subsidence is a\r\nnecessary condition for deposits of great thickness, such as those of\r\nthe Great Valley of California and the Indo-Gangetic plain (p. 101),\r\nthe Mississippi delta (p. 109), and the still more important\r\nformations of the continental delta in gradually sinking troughs (p.\r\n183). It is not too much to say that the character and thickness of\r\neach formation of the stratified rocks depend primarily on these\r\ncrustal movements.\r\n\r\nAlong the Baltic coast of Sweden, bench marks show that the sea is\r\nwithdrawing from the land at a rate which at the north amounts to\r\nbetween three and four feet per century; Towards the south the rate\r\ndecreases. South of Stockholm, until recent years, the sea has gained\r\nupon the land, and here in several seaboard towns streets by the shore\r\nare still submerged. The rate of oscillation increases also from the\r\ncoast inland. On the other hand, along the German coast of the Baltic\r\nthe only historic fluctuations of sea level are those which may be\r\naccounted for by variations due to changes in rainfall. In 1730\r\nCelsius explained the changes of level of the Swedish coast as due to\r\na lowering of the Baltic instead of to an elevation of the land. Are\r\nthe facts just stated consistent with his theory?\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 165. Old Strand Lines, Tadousac, Quebec]\r\n\r\nAt the little town of Tadousac--where the Saguenay River empties into\r\nthe St. Lawrence--there are terraces of old sea beaches, some almost\r\nas fresh as recent railway fills, the highest standing two hundred and\r\nthirty feet above the river (Fig. 165). Here the Saguenay is eight\r\nhundred and forty feet in depth, and the tide ebbs and flows far up\r\nits stream. Was its channel cut to this depth by the river when the\r\nland was at its present height? What oscillations are here recorded,\r\nand to what amount?\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 166. Diagram showing Ruins of Temple, North\r\n      of Naples\r\n\r\n   _C_, ancient sea cliff; _m_, marble pillars, dotted where bored\r\n   by mollusks; _sl_, sea level]\r\n\r\nA few miles north of Naples, Italy, the ruins of an ancient Roman\r\ntemple lie by the edge of the sea, on a narrow plain which is\r\noverlooked in the rear by an old sea cliff (Fig. 166). Three marble\r\npillars are still standing. For eleven feet above their bases these\r\ncolumns are uninjured, for to this height they were protected by an\r\naccumulation of volcanic ashes; but from eleven to nineteen feet they\r\nare closely pitted with the holes of boring marine mollusks. From\r\nthese facts trace the history of the oscillations of the region.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 167. Section in a Region of Folded Rocks]\r\n\r\n\r\nFoldings of the Crust\r\n\r\nThe oscillations which we have just described leave the strata not far\r\nfrom their original horizontal attitude. Figure 167 represents a\r\nregion in which movements of a very different nature have taken place.\r\nHere, on either side of the valley _v_, we find outcrops of layers\r\ntilted at high angles. Sections along the ridge _r_ show that it is\r\ncomposed of layers which slant inward from either side. In places the\r\noutcropping strata stand nearly on edge, and on the right of the\r\nvalley they are quite overturned; a shale _sh_ has come to overlie a\r\nlimestone _lm_ although the shale is the older rock, whose original\r\nposition was beneath the limestone.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 168. Dip and Strike]\r\n\r\nIt is not reasonable to suppose that these rocks were deposited in the\r\nattitude in which we find them now; we must believe that, like other\r\nstratified rocks, they were outspread in nearly level sheets upon the\r\nocean floor. Since that time they must have been deformed. Layers of\r\nsolid rock several miles in thickness have been crumpled and folded\r\nlike soft wax in the hand, and a vast denudation has worn away the\r\nupper portions of the folds, in part represented in our section by\r\ndotted lines.\r\n\r\n=Dip and strike.= In districts where the strata have been disturbed it\r\nis desirable to record their attitude. This is most easily done by\r\ntaking the angle at which the strata are inclined and the compass\r\ndirection in which they slant. It is also convenient to record the\r\ndirection in which the outcrop of the strata trends across the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 169. An Anticline, Maryland]\r\n\r\nThe inclination of a bed of rocks to the horizon is its _dip_ (Fig.\r\n168). The amount of the dip is the angle made with a horizontal plane.\r\nThe dip of a horizontal layer is zero, and that of a vertical layer\r\nis 90°. The direction of the dip is taken with the compass. Thus a\r\ngeologist's notebook in describing the attitude of outcropping strata\r\ncontains many such entries as these: dip 32° north, or dip 8° south 20°\r\nwest,--meaning in the latter case that the amount of the dip is 8° and\r\nthe direction of the dip bears 20° west of south.\r\n\r\nThe line of intersection of a layer with the horizontal plane is the\r\n_strike_. The strike always runs at right angles to the dip.\r\n\r\nDip and strike may be illustrated by a book set aslant on a shelf. The\r\ndip is the acute angle made with the shelf by the side of the book,\r\nwhile the strike is represented by a line running along the book's\r\nupper edge. If the dip is north or south, the strike runs east and\r\nwest.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 170. Folded Strata, Coast of England\r\n\r\n   A syncline in the center, with an anticline on either side]\r\n\r\n=Folded structures.= An upfold, in which the strata dip away from a\r\nline drawn along the crest and called the axis of the fold, is known\r\nas an _anticline_ (Fig. 169). A downfold, where the strata dip from\r\neither side toward the axis of the trough, is called a _syncline_\r\n(Fig. 170). There is sometimes seen a downward bend in horizontal or\r\ngently inclined strata, by which they descend to a lower level. Such a\r\nsingle flexure is a _monocline_ (Fig. 171).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 171. A Monocline]\r\n\r\n=Degrees of folding.= Folds vary in degree from broad, low swells,\r\nwhich can hardly be detected, to the most highly contorted and\r\ncomplicated structures. In _symmetric_ folds (Figs. 169 and 180) the\r\ndips of the rocks on each side the axis of the fold are equal. In\r\n_unsymmetrical_ folds one limb is steeper than the other, as in the\r\nanticline in Figure 167. In _overturned_ folds (Figs. 167 and 172) one\r\nlimb is inclined beyond the perpendicular. _Fan folds_ have been so\r\npinched that the original anticlines are left broader at the top than\r\nat the bottom (Fig. 173).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 172. Overturned Fold, Vermont]\r\n\r\nIn folds where the compression has been great the layers are often\r\nfound thickened at the crest and thinned along the limbs (174). Where\r\nstrong rocks such as heavy limestones are folded together with weak\r\nrocks such as shales, the strong rocks are often bent into great\r\nsimple folds, while the weak rocks are minutely crumpled.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 173. Fan Folds, the Alps]\r\n\r\n=Systems of folds.= As a rule, folds occur in systems. Over the\r\nAppalachian mountain belt, for example, extending from northeastern\r\nPennsylvania to northern Alabama and Georgia, the earth's crust has\r\nbeen thrown into a series of parallel folds whose axes run from\r\nnortheast to southwest (Fig. 175). In Pennsylvania one may count a\r\nscore or more of these earth waves,--some but from ten to twenty miles\r\nin length, and some extending as much as two hundred miles before they\r\ndie away. On the eastern part of this belt the folds are steeper and\r\nmore numerous than on the western side.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 174. Folds with Layers thickened at the\r\n      Crest and thinned along the Limbs]\r\n\r\n=Cause and conditions of folding.= The sections which we have studied\r\nsuggest that rocks are folded by lateral pressure. While a single,\r\nsimple fold might be produced by a heave, a series of folds, including\r\noverturns, fan folds, and folds thickened on their crests at the\r\nexpense of their limbs, could only be made in one way,--by pressure\r\nfrom the side. Experiment has reproduced all forms of folds by\r\nsubjecting to lateral thrust layers of plastic material such as wax.\r\n\r\nVast as the force must have been which could fold the solid rocks of\r\nthe crust as one may crumple the leaves of a magazine in the fingers,\r\nit is only under certain conditions that it could have produced the\r\nresults which we see. Rocks are brittle, and it is only when under a\r\n_heavy load_ and by _great pressure slowly applied_, that they can\r\nthus be folded and bent instead of being crushed to pieces. Under\r\nthese conditions, experiments prove that not only metals such as\r\nsteel, but also brittle rocks such as marble, can be deformed and\r\nmolded and made to flow like plastic clay.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 175. Relief Map of the Northern Appalachian\r\n      Region\r\n\r\n   From Bingham's _Geographic Influences in American History_]\r\n\r\n=Zone of flow, zone of flow and fracture, and zone of fracture.= We\r\nmay believe that at depths which must be reckoned in tens of thousands\r\nof feet the load of overlying rocks is so great that rocks of all\r\nkinds yield by folding to lateral pressure, and flow instead of\r\nbreaking. Indeed, at such profound depths and under such inconceivable\r\nweight no cavity can form, and any fractures would be healed at once\r\nby the welding of grain to grain. At less depths there exists a zone\r\nwhere soft rocks fold and flow under stress, and hard rocks are\r\nfractured; while at and near the surface hard and soft rocks alike\r\nyield by fracture to strong pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\nStructures developed in Compressed Rocks\r\n\r\nDeformed rocks show the effects of the stresses to which they have\r\nyielded, not only in the immense folds into which they have been\r\nthrown but in their smallest parts as well. A hand specimen of slate,\r\nor even a particle under the microscope, may show plications similar\r\nin form and origin to the foldings which have produced ranges of\r\nmountains. A tiny flake of mica in the rocks of the Alps may be\r\npuckered by the same resistless forces which have folded miles of\r\nsolid rock to form that lofty range.\r\n\r\n=Slaty cleavage.= Rocks which have yielded to pressure often split\r\neasily in a certain direction across the bedding planes. This cleavage\r\nis known as slaty cleavage, since it is most perfectly developed in\r\nfine-grained, homogeneous rocks, such as slates, which cleave to the\r\nthin, smooth-surfaced plates with which we are familiar in the slates\r\nused in roofing and for ciphering and blackboards. In coarse-grained\r\nrocks, pressure develops more distant partings which separate the\r\nrocks into blocks.\r\n\r\nSlaty cleavage cannot be due to lamination, since it commonly crosses\r\nbedding planes at an angle, while these planes have been often\r\nwell-nigh or quite obliterated. Examining slate with a microscope, we\r\nfind that its cleavage is due to the grain of the rock. Its particles\r\nare flattened and lie with their broad faces in parallel planes, along\r\nwhich the rock naturally splits more easily than in any other\r\ndirection. The irregular grains of the mud which has been altered to\r\nslate have been squeezed flat by a pressure exerted at right angles to\r\nthe plane of cleavage. Cleavage is found only in folded rocks, and, as\r\nwe may see in Figure 176, the strike of the cleavage runs parallel to\r\nthe strike of the strata and the axis of the folds. The dip of the\r\ncleavage is generally steep, hence the pressure was nearly horizontal.\r\nThe pressure which has acted at right angles to the cleavage, and to\r\nwhich it is due, is the same lateral pressure which has thrown the\r\nstrata into folds.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 176. Slaty Cleavage]\r\n\r\nWe find additional proof that slates have undergone compression at\r\nright angles to their cleavage in the fact that any inclusions in\r\nthem, such as nodules and fossils, have been squeezed out of shape and\r\nhave their long diameters lying in the planes of cleavage.\r\n\r\nThat pressure is competent to cause cleavage is shown by experiment.\r\nHomogeneous material of fine grain, such as beeswax, when subjected to\r\nheavy pressure cleaves at right angles to the direction of the\r\ncompressing force.\r\n\r\n=Rate of folding.= All the facts known with regard to rock deformation\r\nagree that it is a secular process, taking place so slowly that, like\r\nthe deepening of valleys by erosion, it escapes the notice of the\r\ninhabitants of the region. It is only under stresses slowly applied\r\nthat rocks bend without breaking. The folds of some of the highest\r\nmountains have risen so gradually that strong, well-intrenched rivers\r\nwhich had the right of way across the region were able to hold to\r\ntheir courses, and as a circular saw cuts its way through the log\r\nwhich is steadily driven against it, so these rivers sawed their\r\ngorges through the fold as fast as it rose beneath them. Streams which\r\nthus maintain the course which they had antecedent to a deformation of\r\nthe region are known as _antecedent_ streams. Examples of such are the\r\nSutlej and other rivers of India, whose valleys trench the outer\r\nranges of the Himalayas and whose earlier river deposits have been\r\nupturned by the rising ridges. On the other hand, mountain crests are\r\nusually divides, parting the head waters of different drainage\r\nsystems. In these cases the original streams of the region have been\r\nbroken or destroyed by the uplift of the mountain mass across their\r\npaths.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, which have worked more rapidly, processes of deformation\r\nor of denudation?\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 177. An Unroofed Anticline]\r\n\r\n\r\nLand Forms due to Folding\r\n\r\nAs folding goes on so slowly, it is never left to form surface\r\nfeatures unmodified by the action of other agencies. An anticlinal\r\nfold is attacked by erosion as soon as it begins to rise above the\r\noriginal level, and the higher it is uplifted, and the stronger are\r\nits slopes, the faster is it worn away. Even while rising, a young\r\nupfold is often thus unroofed, and instead of appearing as a long,\r\nSmooth, boat-shaped ridge, it commonly has had opened along the rocks\r\nof the axis, when these are weak, a valley which is overlooked by the\r\ninfacing escarpments of the hard layers of the sides of the fold (Fig.\r\n177). Under long-continued erosion, anticlines may be degraded to\r\nvalleys, while the synclines of the same system may be left in relief\r\nas ridges (Fig. 167).\r\n\r\n=Folded mountains.= The vastness of the forces which wrinkle the crust\r\nis best realized in the presence of some lofty mountain range. All\r\nmountains, indeed, are not the result of folding. Some, as we shall\r\nsee, are due to upwarps or to fractures of the crust; some are piles\r\nof volcanic material; some are swellings caused by the intrusion of\r\nmolten matter beneath the surface; some are the relicts left after the\r\nlong denudation of high plateaus.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 178. Mountain Peaks carved in Folded\r\n      Strata, Rocky Mountains, Montana]\r\n\r\nBut most of the mountain ranges of the earth, and some of the\r\ngreatest, such as the Alps and the Himalayas, were originally\r\nmountains of folding. The earth's crust has wrinkled into a fold; or\r\ninto a series of folds, forming a series of parallel ridges and\r\nintervening valleys; or a number of folds have been mashed together\r\ninto a vast upswelling of the crust, in which the layers have been so\r\ncrumpled and twisted, overturned and crushed, that it is exceedingly\r\ndifficult to make out the original structure.\r\n\r\nThe close and intricate folds seen in great mountain ranges were\r\nformed, as we have seen, deep below the surface, within the zone of\r\nfolding. Hence they may never have found expression in any individual\r\nsurface features. As the result of these deformations deep under\r\nground the surface was broadly lifted to mountain height, and the\r\ncrumpled and twisted mountain structures are now to be seen only\r\nbecause erosion has swept away the heavy cover of surface rocks under\r\nwhose load they were developed.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 179. Section of a Portion of the Alps]\r\n\r\nWhen the structure of mountains has been deciphered it is possible to\r\nestimate roughly the amount of horizontal compression which the region\r\nhas suffered. If the strata of the folds of the Alps were smoothed\r\nout, they would occupy a belt seventy-four miles wider than that to\r\nwhich they have been compressed, or twice their present width. A\r\nsection across the Appalachian folds in Pennsylvania shows a\r\ncompression to about two thirds the original width; the belt has been\r\nshortened thirty-five miles in every hundred.\r\n\r\nConsidering the thickness of their strata, the compression which\r\nmountains have undergone accounts fully for their height, with enough\r\nto spare for all that has been lost by denudation.\r\n\r\nThe Appalachian folds involve strata thirty thousand feet in\r\nthickness. Assuming that the folded strata rested on an unyielding\r\nfoundation, and that what was lost in width was gained in height, what\r\nelevation would the range have reached had not denudation worn it as\r\nit rose?\r\n\r\n=The life history of mountains.= While the disturbance and uplift of\r\nmountain masses are due to deformation, their sculpture into ridges\r\nand peaks, valleys and deep ravines, and all the forms which meet the\r\neye in mountain scenery, excepting in the very youngest ranges, is due\r\nsolely to erosion. We may therefore classify mountains according to\r\nthe degree to which they have been dissected. The Juras are an example\r\nof the stage of early youth, in which the anticlines still persist as\r\nridges and the synclines coincide with the valleys; this they owe as\r\nmuch to the slight height of their uplift as to the recency of its\r\ndate (Fig. 180).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 180. Section of a Portion of the Jura\r\n      Mountains]\r\n\r\nThe Alps were upheaved at various times (Fig. 399), the last uplift\r\nbeing later than the uplift of the Juras, but to so much greater\r\nheight that erosion has already advanced them well on towards\r\nmaturity. The mountain mass has been cut to the core, revealing\r\nstrange contortions of strata which could never have found expression\r\nat the surface. Sharp peaks, knife-edged crests, deep valleys with\r\nungraded slopes subject to frequent landslides, are all features of\r\nAlpine scenery typical of a mountain range at this stage in its life\r\nhistory. They represent the survival of the hardest rocks and the\r\nstrongest structures, and the destruction of the weaker in their long\r\nstruggle for existence against the agents of erosion. Although miles\r\nof rock have been removed from such ranges as the Alps, we need not\r\nsuppose that they ever stood much, if any, higher than at present. All\r\nthis vast denudation may easily have been accomplished while their\r\nslow upheaval was going on; in several mountain ranges we have\r\nevidence that elevation has not yet ceased.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 181. Young Mountains, Rocky Mountains of\r\n      Canada]\r\n\r\nUnder long denudation mountains are subdued to the forms\r\ncharacteristic of old age. The lofty peaks and jagged crests of their\r\nearlier life are smoothed down to low domes and rounded crests. The\r\nsouthern Appalachians and portions of the Hartz Mountains in Germany\r\n(Fig. 182) are examples of mountains which have reached this stage.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 182. Subdued Mountains, the Hartz\r\n      Mountains, Germany]\r\n\r\nThere are numerous regions of upland and plains in which the rocks are\r\nfound to have the same structure that we have seen in folded\r\nmountains; they are tilted, crumpled, and overturned, and have clearly\r\nsuffered intense compression. We may infer that their folds were once\r\nlifted to the height of mountains and have since been wasted to\r\nlow-lying lands. Such a section as that of Figure 67 illustrates how\r\nancient mountains may be leveled to their roots, and represents the\r\nfinal stage to which even the Alps and the Himalayas must sometime\r\narrive. Mountains, perhaps of Alpine height, once stood about Lake\r\nSuperior; a lofty range once extended from New England and New Jersey\r\nsouthwestward to Georgia along the Piedmont belt. In our study of\r\nhistoric geology we shall see more clearly how short is the life of\r\nmountains as the earth counts time, and how great ranges have been\r\nlifted, worn away, and again upheaved into a new cycle of erosion.\r\n\r\n=The sedimentary history of folded mountains.= We may mention here\r\nsome of the conditions which have commonly been antecedent to great\r\nfoldings of the crust.\r\n\r\n1. Mountain ranges are made of belts of enormously and exceptionally\r\nthick sediments. The strata of the Appalachians are thirty thousand\r\nfeet thick, while the same formations thin out to five thousand feet\r\nin the Mississippi valley. The folds of the Wasatch Mountains involve\r\nstrata thirty thousand feet thick, which thin to two thousand feet in\r\nthe region of the Plains.\r\n\r\n2. The sedimentary strata of which mountains are made are for the most\r\npart the shallow-water deposits of continental deltas. Mountain ranges\r\nhave been upfolded along the margins of continents.\r\n\r\n3. Shallow-water deposits of the immense thickness found in mountain\r\nranges can be laid only in a gradually sinking area. A profound\r\nsubsidence, often to be reckoned in tens of thousands of feet,\r\nprecedes the upfolding of a mountain range.\r\n\r\nThus the history of mountains of folding is as follows: For long ages\r\nthe sea bottom off the coast of a continent slowly subsides, and the\r\ngreat trough, as fast as it forms, is filled with sediments, which at\r\nlast come to be many thousands of feet thick. The downward movement\r\nfinally ceases. A slow but resistless pressure sets in, and gradually,\r\nand with a long series of many intermittent movements, the vast mass\r\nof accumulated sediments is crumpled and uplifted into a mountain\r\nrange.\r\n\r\n\r\nFractures and Dislocations of the Crust\r\n\r\nConsidering the immense stresses to which the rocks of the crust are\r\nsubjected, it is not surprising to find that they often yield by\r\nfracture, like brittle bodies, instead of by folding and flowing, like\r\nplastic solids. Whether rocks bend or break depends on the character\r\nand condition of the rocks, the load of overlying rocks which they\r\nbear, and the amount of the force and the slowness with which it is\r\napplied.\r\n\r\n=Joints.= At the surface, where their load is least, we find rocks\r\nuniversally broken into blocks of greater or less size by partings\r\nknown as joints. Under this name are included many division planes\r\ncaused by cooling and drying; but it is now generally believed that\r\nthe larger and more regular joints, especially those which run\r\nparallel to the dip and strike of the strata, are fractures due to\r\nup-and-down movements and foldings and twistings of the rocks.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 183. Joints utilized by a River in widening\r\n      its Valley, Iowa]\r\n\r\nJoints are used to great advantage in quarrying, and we have seen how\r\nthey are utilized by the weather in breaking up rock masses, by rivers\r\nin widening their valleys, by the sea in driving back its cliffs, by\r\nglaciers in plucking their beds, and how they are enlarged in soluble\r\nrocks to form natural passageways for underground waters. The ends of\r\nthe parted strata match along both sides of joint planes; in. joints\r\nthere has been little or no displacement of the broken rocks.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 184. A Normal Fault]\r\n\r\n=Faults.= In Figure 184 the rocks have been both broken and dislocated\r\nalong the plane _ff´_. One side must have been moved up or down past\r\nthe other. Such a dislocation is called a fault. The amount of the\r\ndisplacement, as measured by the vertical distance between the ends of\r\na parted layer, is the _throw_ (_cd_). The angle (_ff´v_) which the\r\nfault plane makes with the vertical is the _hade_. In Figure 184 the\r\nright side has gone down relatively to the left; the right is the side\r\nof the downthrow, while the left is the side of the upthrow. Where the\r\nfault plane is not vertical the surfaces on the two sides may be\r\ndistinguished as the _hanging wall_ (that on the right of Figure 184)\r\nand the _foot wall_ (that on the left of the same figure). Faults\r\ndiffer in throw from a fraction of an inch to many thousands of feet.\r\n\r\n=Slickensides.= If we examine the walls of a fault, we may find\r\nfurther evidence of movement in the fact that the surfaces are\r\npolished and grooved by the enormous friction which they have suffered\r\nas they have ground one upon the other. These appearances, called\r\nslickensides, have sometimes been mistaken for the results of glacial\r\naction.\r\n\r\n=Normal faults.= Faults are of two kinds,--normal faults and thrust\r\nfaults. Normal faults, of which Figure 184 is an example, hade to the\r\ndownthrow; the hanging wall has gone down. The total length of the\r\nstrata has been increased by the displacement. It seems that the\r\nstrata have been stretched and broken, and that the blocks have\r\nreadjusted themselves under the action of gravity as they settled.\r\n\r\n=Thrust faults.= Thrust faults hade to the upthrow; the hanging wall\r\nhas gone up. Clearly such faults, where the strata occupy less space\r\nthan before, are due to lateral thrust. Folds and thrust faults are\r\nclosely associated. Under lateral pressure strata may fold to a\r\ncertain point and then tear apart and fault along the surface of least\r\nresistance. Under immense pressure strata also break by shear without\r\nfolding. Thus, in Figure 185, the rigid earth block under lateral\r\nthrust has found it easier to break along the fault plane than to\r\nfold. Where such faults are nearly horizontal they are distinguished\r\nas _thrust planes_.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 185. A Thrust Fault]\r\n\r\nIn all thrust faults one mass has been pushed over another, so as to\r\nbring the underlying and older strata upon younger beds; and when the\r\nfault planes are nearly horizontal, and especially when the rocks have\r\nbeen broken into many slices which have slidden far one upon another,\r\nthe true succession of strata is extremely hard to decipher.\r\n\r\nIn the Selkirk Mountains of Canada the basement rocks of the region\r\nhave been driven east for seven miles on a thrust plane, over rocks\r\nwhich originally lay thousands of feet above them.\r\n\r\nAlong the western Appalachians, from Virginia to Georgia, the mountain\r\nfolds are broken by more than fifteen parallel thrust planes, running\r\nfrom northeast to southwest, along which the older strata have been\r\npushed westward over the younger. The longest continuous fault has\r\nbeen traced three hundred and seventy-five miles, and the greatest\r\nhorizontal displacement has been estimated at not less than eleven\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n=Crush breccia.= Rocks often do not fault with a clean and simple\r\nfracture, but along a zone, sometimes several yards in width, in which\r\nthey are broken to fragments. It may occur also that strata which as a\r\nwhole yield to lateral thrust by folding include beds of brittle\r\nrocks, such as thin-layered limestones, which are crushed to pieces by\r\nthe strain. In either case the fragments when recemented by\r\npercolating waters form a rock known as a _crush breccia_ (pronounced\r\n_bretcha_)(Fig. 186).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 186. Breccia]\r\n\r\nBreccia is a term applied to any rock formed of cemented _angular_\r\nfragments. This rock may be made by the consolidation of volcanic\r\ncinders, of angular waste at the foot of cliffs, or of fragments of\r\ncoral torn by the waves from coral reefs, as well as of strata crushed\r\nby crustal movements.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurface Features due to Dislocations\r\n\r\n=Fault scarps.= A fault of recent date may be marked at surface by a\r\nscarp, because the face of the upthrown block has not yet been worn to\r\nthe level of the downthrow side.\r\n\r\nAfter the upthrown block has been worn down to this level,\r\ndifferential erosion produces fault scarps wherever weak rocks and\r\nresistant rocks are brought in contact along the fault plane; and the\r\nharder rocks, whether on the upthrow or the downthrow side, emerge in\r\na line of cliffs. Where a fault is so old that no abrupt scarps\r\nappear, its general course is sometimes marked by the line of division\r\nbetween highland and lowland or hill and plain. Great faults have\r\nsometimes brought ancient crystalline rocks in contact with weaker and\r\nyounger sedimentary rocks, and long after erosion has destroyed all\r\nfault scarps the harder crystallines rise in an upland of rugged or\r\nmountainous country which meets the lowland along the line of\r\nfaulting.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 187. A Concealed Fault\r\n\r\n   This fault may be inferred from the changes in strata in\r\n   passing along the strike, as from _b_ to _a´_ and from\r\n   _c_ to _b´_]\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of faults give rise to no surface features. The\r\nfaulted region may be old enough to have been baseleveled, or the\r\nrocks on both sides of the line of dislocation may be alike in their\r\nresistance to erosion and therefore have been worn down to a common\r\nslope. The fault may be entirely concealed by the mantle of waste, and\r\nin such cases it can be inferred from abrupt changes in the character\r\nor the strike and dip of the strata where they may outcrop near it\r\n(Fig. 187).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 188. East-West Section across the Broken\r\n      Plateau north of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River,\r\n      Arizona]\r\n\r\nThe plateau trenched by the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River\r\nexhibits a series of magnificent fault scarps whose general course is\r\nfrom north to south, marking the edges of the great crust blocks into\r\nwhich the country has been broken. The highest part of the plateau is\r\na crust block ninety miles long and thirty-five miles in maximum\r\nwidth, which has been hoisted to nine thousand three hundred feet\r\nabove, sea level. On the east it descends four thousand feet by a\r\nmonoclinal fold, which passes into a fault towards the north. On the\r\nwest it breaks down by a succession of terraces faced by fault scarps.\r\nThe throw of these faults varies from seven hundred feet to more than\r\na mile. The escarpments, however, are due in a large degree to the\r\nerosion of weaker rock on the downthrow side.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 189. The Fault separating the Highlands and\r\n      the Lowlands, Scotland]\r\n\r\nThe Highlands of Scotland (Fig. 189) meet the Lowlands on the south\r\nwith a bold front of rugged hills along a line of dislocation which\r\nruns across the country from sea to sea. On the one side are hills of\r\nancient crystalline rocks whose crumpled structures prove that they\r\nare but the roots of once lofty mountains; on the other lies a lowland\r\nof sandstone and other stratified rocks formed from the waste of those\r\nlong-vanished mountain ranges. Remnants of sandstone occur in places\r\non the north of the great fault, and are here seen to rest on the worn\r\nand fairly even surface of the crystallines. We may infer that these\r\nancient mountains were reduced along their margins to low plains,\r\nwhich were slowly lowered beneath the sea to receive a cover of\r\nsedimentary rocks. Still later came an uplift and dislocation. On the\r\none side erosion has since stripped off the sandstones for the most\r\npart, but the hard crystalline rocks yet stand in bold relief. On the\r\nother side the weak sedimentary rocks have been worn down to lowlands.\r\n\r\n=Rift valleys.= In a broken region undergoing uplift or the unequal\r\nsettling which may follow, a slice inclosed between two fissures may\r\nsink below the level of the crust blocks on either side, thus forming\r\na linear depression known as a rift valley, or valley of fracture.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 190. Section from the Mountains of\r\n      Palestine to the Mountains of Moab across the Dead Sea\r\n\r\n   _a_, ancient schists; _b_, Carboniferous strata; _c_, _d_, and\r\n   _e_, Cretaceous strata]\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking examples of this rare type of valley is the\r\nlong trough which runs straight from the Lebanon Mountains of Syria on\r\nthe north to the Red Sea on the south, and whose central portion is\r\noccupied by the Jordan valley and the Dead Sea. The plateau which it\r\ngashes has been lifted more than three thousand feet above sea level,\r\nand the bottom of the trough reaches a depth of two thousand six\r\nhundred feet below that level in parts of the Dead Sea. South of the\r\nDead Sea the floor of the trough rises somewhat above sea level, and\r\nin the Gulf of Akabah again sinks below it. This uneven floor could be\r\naccounted for either by the profound warping of a valley of erosion or\r\nby the unequal depression of the floor of a rift valley. But that the\r\ntrough is a true valley of fracture is proved by the fact that on\r\neither side it is bounded by fault scarps and monoclinal folds. The\r\nkeystone of the arch has subsided. Many geologists believe that the\r\nJordan-Akabah trough, the long narrow basin of the Red Sea, and the\r\nchain of down-faulted valleys which in Africa extends from the strait\r\nof Bab-el-Mandeb as far south as Lake Nyassa--valleys which contain\r\nmore than thirty lakes--belong to a single system of dislocation.\r\n\r\nShould you expect the lateral valleys of a rift valley at the time of\r\nits formation to enter it as hanging valleys or at a common level?\r\n\r\n=Block mountains.= Dislocations take place on so grand a scale that by\r\nthe upheaval of blocks of the earth's crust or the downfaulting of\r\nthe blocks about one which is relatively stationary, mountains known\r\nas block mountains are produced. A tilted crust block may present a\r\nsteep slope on the side upheaved and a more gentle descent on the side\r\ndepressed.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 191. Block Mountains, Southern Oregon]\r\n\r\n=The Basin ranges.= The plateaus of the United States bounded by the\r\nRocky Mountains on the east, and on the west by the ranges which\r\nfront the Pacific, have been profoundly fractured and faulted. The\r\nsystem of great fissures by which they are broken extends north and\r\nsouth, and the long, narrow, tilted crust blocks intercepted between\r\nthe fissures give rise to the numerous north-south ranges of the\r\nregion. Some of the tilted blocks, as those of southern Oregon, are as\r\nyet but moderately carved by erosion, and shallow lakes lie on the\r\nwaste that has been washed into the depressions between them (Fig.\r\n191). We may therefore conclude that their displacement is somewhat\r\nrecent. Others, as those of Nevada, are so old that they have been\r\ndeeply dissected; their original form has been destroyed by erosion,\r\nand the intermontane depressions are occupied by wide plains of waste.\r\n\r\n=Dislocations and river valleys.= Before geologists had proved that\r\nrivers can by their own unaided efforts cut deep canyons, it was\r\ncommon to consider any narrow gorge as a gaping fissure of the crust.\r\nThis crude view has long since been set aside. A map of the plateaus\r\nof northern Arizona shows how independent of the immense faults of the\r\nregion is the course of the Colorado River. In the Alps the tunnels on\r\nthe Saint Gotthard railway pass six times beneath the gorge of the\r\nReuss, but at no point do the rocks show the slightest trace of a\r\nfault.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 192. Fault crossing Valley in Japan]\r\n\r\n=Rate of dislocation.= So far as human experience goes, the earth\r\nmovements which we have just studied, some of which have produced\r\ndeep-sunk valleys and lofty mountain ranges, and faults whose throw is\r\nto be measured in thousands of feet, are slow and gradual. They are\r\nnot accomplished by a single paroxysmal effort, but by slow creep and\r\na series of slight slips continued for vast lengths of time.\r\n\r\nIn the Aspen mining district in Colorado faulting is now going on at a\r\ncomparatively rapid rate. Although no sudden slips take place, the\r\ncreep of the rock along certain planes of faulting gradually bends out\r\nof shape the square-set timbers in horizontal drifts and has closed\r\nsome vertical shafts by shifting the upper portion across the lower.\r\nAlong one of the faults of this region it is estimated that there has\r\nbeen a movement of at least four hundred feet since the Glacial epoch.\r\nMore conspicuous are the instances of active faulting by means of\r\nsudden slips. In 1891 there occurred along an old fault plane in Japan\r\na slip which produced an earth rent traced for fifty miles (Fig. 192).\r\nThe country on one side was depressed in places twenty feet below that\r\non the other, and also shifted as much as thirteen feet horizontally\r\nin the direction of the fault line.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 a slip occurred for forty miles on the great line of\r\ndislocation which runs along the eastern base of the Sierra Nevada\r\nMountains. In the Owens valley, California, the throw amounted to\r\ntwenty-five feet in places, with a horizontal movement along the fault\r\nline of as much as eighteen feet. Both this slip and that in Japan\r\njust mentioned caused severe earthquakes.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of clearness we have described oscillations, foldings,\r\nand fractures of the crust as separate processes, each giving rise to\r\nits own peculiar surface features, but in nature earth movements are\r\nby no means so simple,--they are often implicated with one another:\r\nfolds pass into faults; in a deformed region certain rocks have bent,\r\nwhile others under the same strain, but under different conditions of\r\nplasticity and load, have broken; folded mountains have been worn to\r\ntheir roots, and the peneplains to which they have been denuded have\r\nbeen upwarped to mountain height and afterwards dissected,--as in the\r\ncase of the Allegheny ridges, the southern Carpathians, and other\r\nranges,--or, as in the case of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, have been\r\nbroken and uplifted as mountains of fracture.\r\n\r\nDraw the following diagrams, being careful to show the direction\r\nin which the faulted blocks have moved, by the position of the two\r\nparts of some well-defined layer of limestone, sandstone, or\r\nshale, which occurs on each side of the fault plane, as in Figure\r\n184.\r\n\r\n1. A normal fault with a hade of 15°, the original fault\r\nscarp remaining.\r\n\r\n2. A normal fault with a hade of 50°, the original fault\r\nscarp worn away, showing cliffs caused by harder strata on the\r\ndownthrow side.\r\n\r\n3. A thrust fault with a hade of 30°, showing cliffs due to\r\nharder strata outcropping on the downthrow.\r\n\r\n4. A thrust fault with a hade of 80°, with surface\r\nbaseleveled.\r\n\r\n5. In a region of normal faults a coal mine is being worked along\r\nthe seam of coal _AB_ (Fig. 193). At _B_ it is found broken by a fault\r\nf which hades toward _A_. To find the seam again, should you advise\r\ntunneling up or down from _B_?\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 193]\r\n\r\n6. In a vertical shaft of a coal mine the same bed of coal is\r\npierced twice at different levels because of a fault. Draw a\r\ndiagram to show whether the fault is normal or a thrust.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 194. Ridges to be explained by Faulting]\r\n\r\n7. Copy the diagram in Figure 194, showing how the two ridges may\r\nbe accounted for by a single resistant stratum dislocated by a\r\nfault. Is the fault a _strike fault_, i.e. one running parallel with\r\nthe strike of the strata, or a _dip fault_, one running parallel\r\nwith the direction of the dip?\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 195.

Draw a diagram of the block in Figure 195 as it would appear if\r\ndislocated along the plane _efg_ by a normal fault whose throw equals\r\none fourth the height of the block. Is the fault a strike or a dip\r\nfault? Draw a second diagram showing the same block after denudation\r\nhas worn it down below the center of the upthrown side. Note that the\r\noutcrop of the coal seam is now deceptively repeated. This exercise\r\nmay be done in blocks of wood instead of drawings.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 196. _A_ and _B_.

Do you find any remnants of the\r\noriginal surface _baf_ produced by the dislocation? From the left-hand\r\nside of the mountain infer what was the relief of the region before\r\nthe dislocation. Give the complete history recorded in the diagram\r\nfrom the deposition of the strata to the present.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 198. A Faulted Lava Flow _aa´_]\r\n\r\n11.

On any convenient scale\r\ndraw a similar section of strata with a dip of 30° outcropping along a\r\nhorizontal line normal to the strike one thousand feet in length, and\r\nmeasure the thickness of the strata by the scale employed. The\r\nthickness may also be calculated by trigonometry.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 200. Unconformity between Parallel Strata]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 201. Unconformity between Non-parallel\r\n      Strata]\r\n\r\n\r\nUnconformity\r\n\r\nStrata deposited one upon, another in an unbroken succession are said\r\nto be _conformable_. But the continuous deposition of strata is often\r\ninterrupted by movements of the earth's crust, Old sea floors are\r\nlifted to form land and are again depressed beneath the sea to receive\r\na cover of sediments only after an interval during which they were\r\ncarved by subaërial erosion. An erosion surface which thus parts older\r\nfrom younger strata is known as an _unconformity_, and the strata\r\nabove it are said to be _unconformable_ with the rocks below, or to\r\nrest unconformably upon them. An unconformity thus records movements\r\nof the crust and a consequent break in the deposition of the strata.\r\nIt denotes a period of land erosion of greater or less length, which\r\nmay sometimes be roughly measured by the stage in the erosion cycle\r\nwhich the land surface had attained before its burial. Unconformable\r\nstrata may be _parallel_, as in Figure 200, where the record includes\r\nthe deposition of strata _a_, their emergence, the erosion of the land\r\nsurface _ss_, a submergence and the deposit of the strata _b_, and\r\nlastly, emergence and the erosion of the present surface _s´s´_.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 202. Carboniferous Limestone resting\r\n      unconformably on Early Silurian Slates, Yorkshire, England]\r\n\r\nOften the earth movements to which the uplift or depression was due\r\ninvolved tilting or folding of the earlier strata, so that the strata\r\nare now nonparallel as well as unconformable. In Figure 201, for\r\nexample, the record includes deposition, uplift, and _tilting_ of _a_;\r\nerosion, depression, the deposit of _b_; and finally the uplift which\r\nhas brought the rocks to open air and permitted the dissection by\r\nwhich the unconformity is revealed.\r\n\r\nFrom this section we infer that during early Silurian times the area\r\nwas sea, and thick sea muds were laid upon it. These were later\r\naltered to hard slates by pressure and upfolded into mountains. During\r\nthe later Silurian and the Devonian the area was land and suffered\r\nvast denudation. In the Carboniferous period it was lowered beneath\r\nthe sea and received a cover of limestone.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 203. Diagram Illustrating how the Age of\r\n      Mountains is determined]\r\n\r\n=The age of mountains.= It is largely by means of unconformities that\r\nwe read the history of mountain making and other deformations and\r\nmovements of the crust. In Figure 203, for example, the deformation\r\nwhich upfolded the range of mountains took place after the deposit of\r\nthe series of strata a of which the mountains are composed, and before\r\nthe deposit of the stratified rocks, which rest unconformably on a and\r\nhave not shared their uplift.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 204. Section of Mountain Range showing\r\n      repeated Uplifts\r\n\r\n   _a_, strata whose folding formed a mountain range; on,\r\n   baseleveled surface produced by long denudation of the\r\n   mountains; _b_, tilted strata resting unconformably on _a_;\r\n   _c_, horizontal strata parted from _b_ by the unconformity\r\n   _u´u´_. The first uplift of the range preceded the period of\r\n   time when _b_ was deposited. The and uplift, to which the\r\n   present mountains owe their height, was later than this period\r\n   but earlier than the period when strata _c_ were laid]\r\n\r\nMost great mountain ranges, like the Sierra Nevada and the Alps, mark\r\nlines of weakness along which the earth's crust has yielded again and\r\nagain during the long ages of geological time. The strata deposited at\r\nvarious times about their flanks have been infolded by later\r\ncrumplings with the original mountain mass, and have been repeatedly\r\ncrushed, inverted, faulted, intruded with igneous rocks, and denuded.\r\nThe structure of great mountain ranges thus becomes exceedingly\r\ncomplex and difficult to read. A comparatively simple case of repeated\r\nuplift is shown in Figure 204. In the section of a portion of the Alps\r\nshown in Figure 179 a far more complicated history may be deciphered.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 205. Unconformity showing Buried Valleys\r\n\r\n   _lm_, limestone; _sh_, shale; _r_, _r´_, and _r´´_, river silts\r\n   filling eroded valleys in the limestone. The upper surface of\r\n   the limestone is evidently a land surface developed by erosion.\r\n   The valleys which trench it are narrow and steep-sided; hence\r\n   the land surface had not reached maturity. The sands and muds,\r\n   now hardened to firm rock, which fill these valleys, _r_, _r´_,\r\n   and _r´´_, contain no relics of the sea, but Instead the remains\r\n   of land animals and plants. They are river deposits, and we may\r\n   infer that owing to a subsidence the young rivers ceased to\r\n   degrade their channels and slowly filled their gorges with\r\n   sands and silts. The overlying shale records a further\r\n   depression which brought the lanes below the level of the sea.\r\n   A section similar to this is to be seen in the coal mines of\r\n   Bernissant, Belgium, where a gorge twice as deep as that of\r\n   Niagara was discovered within whose ancient river deposits were\r\n   found entombed the skeletons of more than a score of the huge\r\n   reptiles characteristic of the age when the gorge was cut and\r\n   filled]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 206.

The\r\n   surface _bb_ of the ancient crystalline rocks is mountainous,\r\n   with peaks rising to a height of as much as three thousand\r\n   feet. It is one of the most ancient land surfaces on the planet\r\n   and is covered unconformably with pre-Cambrian sandstones\r\n   thousands of feet in thickness, in which the Torridonian\r\n   Mountains of Scotland have been carved.

How does it differ from the surface of the crystalline\r\nrocks seen in the Torridonian Mountains (Fig. 206), and why? This\r\nsurface _mm´_ is one of the oldest land surfaces of which any vestige\r\nremains. It is a bit of fossil geography buried from view since the\r\nearliest geological ages and recently brought to light by the erosion\r\nof the canyon.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 208. View of the North Wall of the Grand\r\n      Canyon of the Colorado River, Arizona, showing the\r\n      Unconformities illustrated in Figure 207]\r\n\r\nHow did the surface _mm´_ come to receive its cover of sandstones _b_?\r\nFrom the thickness and coarseness of these sediments draw inferences\r\nas to the land mass from which they were derived.

How does it come to cross the hard\r\ncrystalline rocks a and the weaker sandstones _b_ at the same\r\nimpartial level? How did the sediments of _c_ come to be laid upon it?\r\nGive now the entire history recorded in the section, and in addition\r\nthat involved in the production of the platform _P_, shown in Figure\r\n130, and that of the cutting of the canyon. How does the time involved\r\nin the cutting of the canyon compare with that required for the\r\nproduction of the surfaces _mm´_, _nn´_, and _P_?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nEARTHQUAKES\r\n\r\n\r\nAny sudden movement of the rocks of the crust, as when they tear apart\r\nwhen a fissure is formed or extended, or slip from time to time along\r\na growing fault, produces a jar called an earthquake, which spreads in\r\nall directions from the place of disturbance.\r\n\r\n=The Charleston earthquake.= On the evening of August 31, 1886, the\r\ncity of Charleston, S.C., was shaken by one of the greatest\r\nearthquakes which has occurred in the United States. A slight tremor\r\nwhich rattled the windows was followed a few seconds later by a roar,\r\nas of subterranean thunder, as the main shock passed beneath the city.\r\nHouses swayed to and fro, and their heaving floors overturned\r\nfurniture and threw persons off their feet as, dizzy and nauseated,\r\nthey rushed to the doors for safety. In sixty seconds a number of\r\nhouses were completely wrecked, fourteen thousand chimneys were\r\ntoppled over, and in all the city scarcely a building was left without\r\nserious injury. In the vicinity of Charleston railways were twisted\r\nand trains derailed. Fissures opened in the loose superficial\r\ndeposits, and in places spouted water mingled with sand from shallow\r\nunderlying aquifers.\r\n\r\nThe point of origin, or _focus_, of the earthquake was inferred from\r\nsubsequent investigations to be a rent in the rocks about twelve miles\r\nbeneath the surface. From the center of greatest disturbance, which\r\nlay above the focus, a few miles northwest of the city, the surface\r\nshock traveled outward in every direction, with decreasing effects, at\r\nthe rate of nearly two hundred miles per minute. It was felt from\r\nBoston to Cuba, and from eastern Iowa to the Bermudas, over a circular\r\narea whose diameter was a thousand miles.\r\n\r\nAn earthquake is transmitted from the focus through the elastic rocks\r\nof the crust, as a wave, or series of waves, of compression and\r\nrarefaction, much as a sound wave is transmitted through the elastic\r\nmedium of the air. Each earth particle vibrates with exceeding\r\nswiftness, but over a very short path. The swing of a particle in firm\r\nrock seldom exceeds one tenth of an inch in ordinary earthquakes, and\r\nwhen it reaches one half an inch and an inch, the movement becomes\r\ndangerous and destructive.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 210. Block of the Earth's Crust shaken by\r\n      an Earthquake\r\n\r\n   _x_, focus; _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, successive spheroidal waves in\r\n   the crust; _a´_, _b´_, _c´_, _d´_, successive surface waves\r\n   produced by the outcropping of _a_, _b_, _c_, and _d_]\r\n\r\nThe velocity of earthquake waves, like that of all elastic waves,\r\nvaries with the temperature and elasticity of the medium. In the deep,\r\nhot, elastic rocks they speed faster than in the cold and broken rocks\r\nnear the surface. The deeper the point of origin and the more violent\r\nthe initial shock, the faster and farther do the vibrations run.\r\n\r\nGreat earthquakes, caused by some sudden displacement or some violent\r\nrending of the rocks, shake the entire planet. Their waves run through\r\nthe body of the earth at the rate of about three hundred and fifty\r\nmiles a minute, and more slowly round its circumference, registering\r\ntheir arrival at opposite sides of the globe on the exceedingly\r\ndelicate instruments of modern earthquake observatories.\r\n\r\n=Geological effects.= Even great earthquakes seldom produce geological\r\neffects of much importance. Landslides may be shaken down from the\r\nsides of mountains and hills, and cracks may be opened in the surface\r\ndeposits of plains; but the transient shiver, which may overturn\r\ncities and destroy thousands of human lives, runs through the crust\r\nand leaves it much the same as before.\r\n\r\n=Earthquakes attending great displacements.= Great earthquakes\r\nfrequently attend the displacement of large masses of the rocks of the\r\ncrust. In 1822 the coast of Chile was suddenly raised three or four\r\nfeet, and the rise was five or six feet a mile inland. In 1835 the\r\nsame region was again upheaved from two to ten feet. In each instance\r\na destructive earthquake was felt for one thousand miles along the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nThe great California earthquake of 1906.= A sudden dislocation\r\noccurred in 1906 along an ancient fault plane which extends for 300\r\nmiles through western California. The vertical displacement did not\r\nexceed four feet, while the horizontal shifting reached a maximum of\r\ntwenty feet. Fences, rows of trees, and roads which crossed the fault\r\nwere broken and offset. The latitude and longitude of all points over\r\nthousands of square miles were changed. On each side of the fault the\r\nearth blocks moved in opposite directions, the block on the east\r\nmoving southward and that on the west moving northward and to twice\r\nthe distance. East and west of the fault the movements lessened with\r\nincreasing distance from it.\r\n\r\nThis sudden slip set up an earthquake lasting sixty-five seconds,\r\nfollowed by minor shocks recurring for many days. In places the jar\r\nshook down the waste on steep hillsides, snapped off or uprooted\r\ntrees, and rocked houses from their foundations or threw down their\r\nwalls or chimneys. The water mains of San Francisco were broken, and\r\nthe city was thus left defenseless against a conflagration which\r\ndestroyed $500,000,000 worth of property. The destructive effects\r\nvaried with the nature of the ground. Buildings on firm rock suffered\r\nleast, while those on deep alluvium were severely shaken by the\r\nundulations, like water waves, into which the loose material was\r\nthrown. Well-braced steel structures, even of the largest size, were\r\nearthquake proof, and buildings of other materials, when honestly\r\nbuilt and intelligently designed to withstand earthquake shocks,\r\nusually suffered little injury. The length of the intervals between\r\nsevere earthquakes in western California shows that a great\r\ndislocation so relieves the stresses of the adjacent earth blocks that\r\nscores of years may elapse before the stresses again accumulate and\r\ncause another dislocation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most violent earthquake which ever visited the United\r\nStates attended the depression, in 1812, of a region seventy-five\r\nmiles long and thirty miles wide, near New Madrid, Mo. Much of the\r\narea was converted into swamps and some into shallow lakes, while a\r\nregion twenty miles in diameter was bulged up athwart the channel of\r\nthe Mississippi. Slight quakes are still felt in this region from time\r\nto time, showing that the strains to which the dislocation was due\r\nhave not yet been fully relieved.\r\n\r\n=Earthquakes originating beneath the sea.= Many earthquakes originate\r\nbeneath the sea, and in a number of examples they seem to have been\r\naccompanied, as soundings indicate, by local subsidences of the ocean\r\nbottom. There have been instances where the displacement has been\r\nsufficient to set the entire Pacific Ocean pulsating for many hours.\r\nIn mid ocean the wave thus produced has a height of only a few feet,\r\nwhile it may be two hundred miles in width. On shores near the point\r\nof origin destructive waves two or three score feet in height roll in,\r\nand on coasts thousands of miles distant the expiring undulations may\r\nbe still able to record themselves on tidal gauges.\r\n\r\n=Distribution of earthquakes.= Every half hour some considerable area\r\nof the earth's surface is sensibly shaken by an earthquake, but\r\nearthquakes are by no means uniformly distributed over the globe. As\r\nwe might infer from what we know as to their causes, earthquakes are\r\nmost frequent in regions now undergoing deformation. Such are young\r\nrising mountain ranges, fault lines where readjustments recur from\r\ntime to time, and the slopes of suboceanic depressions whose steepness\r\nsuggests that subsidence may there be in progress.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes, often of extreme severity, frequently visit the lofty and\r\nyoung ranges of the Andes, while they are little known in the subdued\r\nold mountains of Brazil. The Highlands of Scotland are crossed by a\r\ndeep and singularly straight depression called the Great Glen, which\r\nhas been excavated along a very ancient line of dislocation. The\r\nearthquakes which occur from time to time in this region, such as the\r\nInverness earthquake in 1891, are referred to slight slips along this\r\nfault plane.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, earthquakes are very frequent. More than a thousand are\r\nrecorded every year, and twenty-nine world-shaking earthquakes\r\noccurred in the three years ending with 1901. They originate, for the\r\nmost part, well down on the eastern flank of the earth fold whose\r\nsummit is the mountainous crest of the islands, and which plunges\r\nsteeply beneath the sea to the abyss of the Tuscarora Deep.\r\n\r\n=Minor causes of earthquakes.= Since any concussion within the crust\r\nsets up an earth jar, there are several minor causes of earthquakes,\r\nsuch as volcanic explosions and even the collapse of the roofs of\r\ncaves. The earthquakes which attend the eruption of volcanoes are\r\nlocal, even in the case of the most violent volcanic paroxysms known.\r\nWhen the top of a volcano has been blown to fragments, the\r\naccompanying earth shock has sometimes not been felt more than\r\ntwenty-five miles away.\r\n\r\n=Depth of focus.= The focus of the Charleston earthquake, estimated at\r\nabout twelve miles below the surface, was exceptionally deep. Volcanic\r\nearthquakes are particularly shallow, and probably no earthquakes\r\nknown have started at a greater depth than fifteen or twenty miles.\r\nThis distance is so slight compared with the earth's radius that we\r\nmay say that earthquakes are but skin-deep.\r\n\r\nShould you expect the velocity of an earthquake to be greater in a\r\npeneplain or in a river delta?\r\n\r\nAfter an earthquake, piles on which buildings rested were found driven\r\ninto the ground, and chimneys crushed at base. From what direction did\r\nthe shock come?\r\n\r\nChimneys standing on the south walls of houses toppled over on the\r\nroof. Should you infer that the shock in this case came from the north\r\nor south?\r\n\r\nHow should you expect a shock from the east to affect pictures hanging\r\non the east and the west walls of a room? how the pictures hanging on\r\nthe north and the south walls?\r\n\r\nIn parts of the country, as in southwestern Wisconsin, slender erosion\r\npillars, or \"monuments,\" are common. What inference could you draw as\r\nto the occurrence in such regions of severe earthquakes in the recent\r\npast?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nVOLCANOES\r\n\r\n\r\nConnected with movements of the earth's crust which take place so\r\nslowly that they can be inferred only from their effects is one of the\r\nmost rapid and impressive of all geological processes,--the extrusion\r\nof molten rock from beneath the surface of the earth, giving rise to\r\nall the various phenomena of volcanoes.\r\n\r\nIn a volcano, molten rock from a region deep below, which we may call\r\nits reservoir, ascends through a pipe or fissure to the surface. The\r\nmaterials erupted may be spread over vast areas, or, as is commonly\r\nthe case, may accumulate about the opening, forming a conical pile\r\nknown as the volcanic cone. It is to this cone that popular usage\r\nrefers the word _volcano_; but the cone is simply a conspicuous part\r\nof the volcanic mechanism whose still more important parts, the\r\nreservoir and the pipe, are hidden from view.\r\n\r\nVolcanic eruptions are of two types,--_effusive_ eruptions, in which\r\nmolten rock wells up from below and flows forth in streams of _lava_\r\n(a comprehensive term applied to all kinds of rock emitted from\r\nvolcanoes in a molten state), and _explosive_ eruptions, in which the\r\nrock is blown out in fragments great and small by the expansive force\r\nof steam.\r\n\r\n\r\nEruptions of the Effusive Type\r\n\r\n=The Hawaiian volcanoes.= The Hawaiian Islands are all volcanic\r\nin origin, and have a linear arrangement characteristic of many\r\nvolcanic groups in all parts of the world. They are strung along a\r\nnorthwest-southeast line, their volcanoes standing in two parallel\r\nrows as if reared along two adjacent lines of fracture or folding. In\r\nthe northwestern islands the volcanoes have long been extinct and are\r\nworn low by erosion. In the southeastern island. Hawaii, three\r\nvolcanoes are still active and in process of building. Of these Mauna\r\nLoa, the monarch of volcanoes, with a girth of two hundred miles and a\r\nheight of nearly fourteen thousand feet above sea level, is a lava\r\ndome the slope of whose sides does not average more than five degrees.\r\nOn the summit is an elliptical basin ten miles in circumference and\r\nseveral hundred feet deep. Concentric cracks surround the rim, and\r\nfrom time to time the basin is enlarged as great slices are detached\r\nfrom the vertical walls and engulfed.\r\n\r\nSuch a volcanic basin, formed by the insinking of the top of the cone,\r\nis called a _caldera_.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 211. Mauna Loa]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 212. Caldera of Mauna Loa]\r\n\r\nOn the flanks of Mauna Loa, four thousand feet above sea level, lies the\r\ncaldera of Kilauea, an independent volcano whose dome has been joined to\r\nthe larger mountain by the gradual growth of the two. In each caldera\r\nthe floor, which to the eye is a plain of black lava, is the congealed\r\nsurface of a column of molten rock. At times of an eruption lakes of\r\nboiling lava appear which may be compared to air holes in a frozen\r\nriver. Great waves surge up, lifting tons of the fiery liquid a score of\r\nfeet in air, to fall back with a mighty plunge and roar, and\r\noccasionally the lava rises several hundred feet in fountains of\r\ndazzling brightness. The lava lakes may flood the floor of the basin,\r\nbut in historic times have never been known to fill it and overflow the\r\nrim. Instead, the heavy column of lava breaks way through the sides of\r\nthe mountain and discharges in streams which flow down the mountain\r\nslopes for a distance sometimes of as much as thirty-five miles. With\r\nthe drawing off of the lava the column in the duct of the volcano\r\nlowers, and the floor of the caldera wholly or in part subsides. A black\r\nand steaming abyss marks the place of the lava lakes (Fig. 213). After a\r\ntime the lava rises in the duct, the floor is floated higher, and the\r\nboiling lakes reappear.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 213. Portion of Caldera of Kilauea after\r\n       Collapse following an Eruption]\r\n\r\nThe eruptions of the Hawaiian volcanoes are thus of the effusive type.\r\nThe column of lava rises, breaks through the side of the mountain, and\r\ndischarges in lava streams. There are no explosions, and usually no\r\nearthquakes, or very slight ones, accompany the eruptions. The lava in\r\nthe calderas boils because of escaping steam, but the vapor emitted is\r\ncomparatively little, and seldom hangs above the summits in heavy\r\nclouds. We see here in its simplest form the most impressive and\r\nimportant fact in all volcanic action, molten rock has been driven\r\nupward to the surface from some deep-lying source.\r\n\r\n=Lava flows.= As lava issues from the side of a volcano or overflows\r\nfrom the summit, it flows away in a glowing stream resembling molten\r\niron drawn white-hot from an iron furnace. The surface of the stream\r\nsoon cools and blackens, and the hard crust of nonconducting rock may\r\ngrow thick and firm enough to form a tunnel, within which the fluid\r\nlava may flow far before it loses its heat to any marked degree. Such\r\ntunnels may at last be left as caves by the draining away of the lava,\r\nand are sometimes several miles in length.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 214. Pahoehoe Lava, Hawaii]\r\n\r\n=Pahoehoe and aa.= When the crust of highly fluid lava remains unbroken\r\nafter its first freezing, it presents a smooth, hummocky, and ropy\r\nsurface known by the Hawaiian term _pahoehoe_ (Fig. 214). On the other\r\nhand, the crust of a viscid flow may be broken and splintered as it is\r\ndragged along by the slowly moving mass beneath. The stream then appears\r\nas a field of stones clanking and grinding on, with here and there from\r\nsome chink a dull red glow or a wisp of steam. It sets to a surface\r\ncalled _aa_, of broken, sharp-edged blocks, which is often both\r\ndifficult and dangerous to traverse (Fig. 215).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 215. Lava Flow of the _Aa_ Type, Cinder\r\n       Cones in the Distance, Arizona]\r\n\r\n=Fissure eruptions.= Some of the largest and most important outflows\r\nof lava have not been connected with volcanic cones, but have been\r\ndischarged from fissures, flooding the country far and wide with\r\nmolten rock. Sheet after sheet of molten rock has been successively\r\noutpoured, and there have been built up, layer upon layer, plateaus of\r\nlava thousands of feet in thickness and many thousands of square miles\r\nin area.\r\n\r\n=Iceland.= This island plateau has been rent from time to time by\r\nfissures from which floods of lava have outpoured. In some instances\r\nthe lava discharges along the whole length of the fissure, but more\r\noften only at certain points upon it. The Laki fissure, twenty miles\r\nlong, was in eruption in 1783 for seven months. The inundation of\r\nfluid rock which poured from it is the largest of historic record,\r\nreaching a distance of forty-seven miles and covering two hundred and\r\ntwenty square miles to an average depth of a hundred feet. At the\r\npresent time the fissure is traced by a line of several hundred\r\ninsignificant mounds of fragmental materials which mark where the lava\r\nissued (Fig. 216).\r\n\r\nThe distance to which the fissure eruptions of Iceland flow on slopes\r\nextremely gentle is noteworthy. One such stream is ninety miles in\r\nlength, and another seventy miles long has a slope of little more than\r\none half a degree.\r\n\r\nWhere lava is emitted at one point and flows to a less distance there\r\nis gradually built up a dome of the shape of an inverted saucer with\r\nan immense base but comparatively low. Many _lava domes_ have been\r\ndiscovered in Iceland, although from their exceedingly gentle slopes,\r\noften but two or three degrees, they long escaped the notice of\r\nexplorers.\r\n\r\nThe entire plateau of Iceland, a region as large as Ohio, is composed\r\nof volcanic products,--for the most part of successive sheets of lava\r\nwhose total thickness falls little short of two miles. The lava sheets\r\nexposed to view were outpoured in open air and not beneath the sea;\r\nfor peat bogs and old forest grounds are interbedded with them, and\r\nthe fossil plants of these vegetable deposits prove that the plateau\r\nhas long been building and is very ancient. On the steep sea cliffs of\r\nthe island, where its structure is exhibited, the sheets of lava are\r\nseen to be cut with many _dikes_,--fissures which have been filled by\r\nmolten rock,--and there is little doubt that it was through these\r\nfissures that the lava outwelled in successive flows which spread far\r\nand wide over the country and gradually reared the enormous pile of\r\nthe plateau.\r\n\r\n\r\nEruptions of the Explosive Type\r\n\r\nIn the majority of volcanoes the lava which rises in the pipe is at\r\nleast in part blown into fragments with violent explosions and shot\r\ninto the air together with vast quantities of water vapor and various\r\ngases. The finer particles into--which the lava is exploded are called\r\n_volcanic dust_ or _volcanic ashes_, and are often carried long\r\ndistances by the wind before they settle to the earth. The coarser\r\nfragments fall about the vent and there accumulate in a steep,\r\nconical, volcanic mountain. As successive explosions keep open the\r\nthroat of the pipe, there remains on the summit a cup-shaped\r\ndepression called the _crater_.\r\n\r\n=Stromboli.= To study the nature of these explosions we may visit\r\nStromboli, a low volcano built chiefly of fragmental materials, which\r\nrises from the sea off the north coast of Sicily and is in constant\r\nthough moderate action.\r\n\r\nOver the summit hangs a cloud of vapor which strikingly resembles the\r\ncolumn of smoke puffed from the smokestack of a locomotive, in that it\r\nconsists of globular masses, each the product of a distinct explosion.\r\nAt night the cloud of vapor is lighted with a red glow at intervals of\r\na few minutes, like the glow on the trail of smoke behind the\r\nlocomotive when from time to time the fire box is opened. Because of\r\nthis intermittent light flashing thousands of feet above the sea,\r\nStromboli has been given the name of the Lighthouse of the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nLooking down into the crater of the volcano, one sees a viscid lava\r\nslowly seething. The agitation gradually increases. A great bubble\r\nforms. It bursts with an explosion which causes the walls of the\r\ncrater to quiver with a miniature earthquake, and an outrush of steam\r\ncarries the fragments of the bubble aloft for a thousand feet to fall\r\ninto the crater or on the mountain side about it. With the explosion\r\nthe cooled and darkened crust of the lava is removed, and the light of\r\nthe incandescent liquid beneath is reflected from the cloud of vapor\r\nwhich overhangs the cone.\r\n\r\nAt Stromboli we learn the lesson that the explosive force in volcanoes\r\nis that of steam. The lava in the pipe is permeated with it much as is\r\na thick boiling porridge. The steam in boiling porridge is unable to\r\nescape freely and gathers into bubbles which in breaking spurt out\r\ndrops of the pasty substance; in the same way the explosion of great\r\nbubbles of steam in the viscid lava shoots clots and fragments of it\r\ninto the air.\r\n\r\n=Krakatoa.= The most violent eruption of history, that of Krakatoa, a\r\nsmall volcanic island in the strait between Sumatra and Java, occurred\r\nin the last week of August, 1883. Continuous explosions shot a column\r\nof steam and ashes. seventeen miles in air. A black cloud, beneath\r\nwhich was midnight darkness and from which fell a rain of ashes and\r\nstones, overspread the surrounding region to a distance of one hundred\r\nand fifty miles. Launched on the currents of the upper air, the dust\r\nwas swiftly carried westward to long distances. Three days after the\r\neruption it fell on the deck of a ship sixteen hundred miles away, and\r\nin thirteen days the finest impalpable powder from the volcano had\r\nfloated round the globe. For many months the dust hung over Europe and\r\nAmerica as a faint lofty haze illuminated at sunrise and sunset with\r\nbrilliant crimson. In countries nearer the eruption, as in India and\r\nAfrica, the haze for some time was so thick that it colored sun and\r\nmoon with blue, green, and copper-red tints and encircled them with\r\ncoronas.\r\n\r\nAt a distance of even a thousand miles the detonations of the eruption\r\nsounded like the booming of heavy guns a few miles away. In one\r\ndirection they were audible for a distance as great as that from San\r\nFrancisco to Cleveland. The entire atmosphere was thrown into\r\nundulations under which all barometers rose and fell as the air waves\r\nthrice encircled the earth. The shock of the explosions raised sea\r\nwaves which swept round the adjacent shores at a height of more than\r\nfifty feet, and which were perceptible halfway around the globe.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the eruption it was found that half the mountain had\r\nbeen blown away, and that where the central part of the island had\r\nbeen the sea was a thousand feet deep.\r\n\r\n=Martinique and St. Vincent.= In 1902 two dormant volcanoes of the\r\nWest Indies, Mt. Pelee in Martinique and Soufrière in St. Vincent,\r\nbroke into eruption simultaneously. No lava was emitted, but there\r\nwere blown into the air great quantities of ashes, which mantled the\r\nadjacent parts of the islands with a pall as of gray snow. In early\r\nstages of the eruption lakes which occupied old craters were\r\ndischarged and swept down the ash-covered mountain valleys in torrents\r\nof boiling mud.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions there was shot from the crater of each volcano a\r\nthick and heavy cloud of incandescent ashes and steam, which rushed\r\ndown the mountain side like an avalanche, red with glowing stones and\r\nscintillating with lightning flashes. Forests and buildings in its\r\npath were leveled as by a tornado, wood was charred and set on fire by\r\nthe incandescent fragments, all vegetation was destroyed, and to\r\nbreathe the steam and hot, suffocating dust of the cloud was death to\r\nevery living creature. On the morning of the 8th of May, 1902, the\r\nfirst of these peculiar avalanches from Mt. Pelee fell on the city of\r\nSt. Pierre and instantly destroyed the lives of its thirty thousand\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 219. An Eruption of Vesuvius, 1872]\r\n\r\nThe eruptions of many volcanoes partake of both the effusive and the\r\nexplosive types: the molten rock in the pipe is in part blown into the\r\nair with explosions of steam, and in part is discharged in streams of\r\nlava over the lip of the crater and from fissures in the sides of the\r\ncone. Such are the eruptions of Vesuvius, one of which is illustrated\r\nin Figure 219.\r\n\r\n=Submarine eruptions.= The many volcanic islands of the ocean and the\r\ncoral islands resting on submerged volcanic peaks prove that eruptions\r\nhave often taken place upon the ocean floor and have there built up\r\nenormous piles of volcanic fragments and lava. The Hawaiian volcanoes\r\nrise from a depth of eighteen thousand feet of water and lift their\r\nheads to about thirty thousand feet above the ocean bed. Christmas\r\nIsland (see p. 194), built wholly beneath the ocean, is a coral-capped\r\nvolcanic peak, whose total height, as measured from the bottom of the\r\nsea, is more than fifteen thousand feet. Deep-sea soundings have\r\nrevealed the presence of numerous peaks which fail to reach sea level\r\nand which no doubt are submarine volcanoes. A number of volcanoes on\r\nthe land were submarine in their early stages, as, for example, the\r\nvast pile of Etna, the celebrated Sicilian volcano, which rests on\r\nstratified volcanic fragments containing marine shells now uplifted\r\nfrom the sea.\r\n\r\nSubmarine outflows of lava and deposits of volcanic fragments become\r\ncovered with sediments during the long intervals between eruptions.\r\nSuch volcanic deposits are said to be _contemporaneous_, because they\r\nare formed during the same period as the strata among which they are\r\nimbedded. Contemporaneous lava sheets may be expected to bake the\r\nsurface of the stratum on which they rest, while the sediments\r\ndeposited upon them are unaltered by their heat. They are among the\r\nmost permanent records of volcanic action, far outlasting the greatest\r\nvolcanic mountains built in open air.\r\n\r\nFrom upraised submarine volcanoes, such as Christmas Island, it is\r\nlearned that lava flows which are poured out upon the bottom of the\r\nsea do not differ materially either in composition or texture from\r\nthose of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nVolcanic Products\r\n\r\nVast amounts of steam are, as we have seen, emitted from volcanoes,\r\nand comparatively small quantities of other vapors, such as various\r\nacid and sulphurous gases. The rocks erupted from volcanoes differ\r\nwidely in chemical composition and in texture.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 220. Cellular Lava]\r\n\r\n=Acidic and basic lavas.= Two classes of volcanic rocks may be\r\ndistinguished,--those containing a large proportion of silica (silicic\r\nacid, SiO_{2}) and therefore called _acidic_, and those containing less\r\nsilica and a larger proportion of the bases (lime, magnesia, soda,\r\netc.) and therefore called _basic_. The acidic lavas, of which\r\n_rhyolite_ and _thrachyte_ are examples, are comparatively light in\r\ncolor and weight, and are difficult to melt. The basic lavas, of which\r\n_basalt_ is a type, are dark and heavy and melt at a lower\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n=Scoria and pumice.= The texture of volcanic rocks depends in part on\r\nthe degree to which they were distended by the steam which permeated\r\nthem when in a molten state. They harden into compact rock where the\r\nsteam cannot expand. Where the steam is released from pressure, as on\r\nthe surface of a lava stream, it forms bubbles (steam blebs) of\r\nvarious sizes, which give the hardened rock a cellular structure\r\n(Fig. 220), In this way are formed the rough slags and clinkers called\r\n_scoria_, which are found on the surface of flows and which are also\r\nthrown out as clots of lava in explosive eruptions.\r\n\r\nOn the surface of the seething lava in the throat of the volcano there\r\ngathers a rock foam, which, when hurled into the air, is cooled and\r\nfalls as _pumice_,--a spongy gray rock so light that it floats on\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 221. Amygdules in Lava]\r\n\r\n=Amygdules.= The steam blebs of lava flows are often drawn out from a\r\nspherical to an elliptical form resembling that of an almond, and\r\nafter the rock has cooled these cavities are gradually filled with\r\nminerals deposited from solution by underground water. From their\r\nshape such casts are called amygdules (Greek, _amygdalon_, an almond).\r\nAmygdules are commonly composed of silica. Lavas contain both silica\r\nand the alkalies, potash and soda, and after dissolving the alkalies,\r\npercolating water is able to take silica also into solution. Most\r\n_agates_ are banded amygdules in which the silica has been laid in\r\nvaricolored, concentric layers (Fig. 222).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 222. Polished Section of an Agate]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 223. Microsection showing the Beginnings of\r\n      Crystal Growth in Glassy Lava]\r\n\r\n=Glassy and stony lavas.= Volcanic rocks differ in texture according\r\nalso to the rate at which they have solidified. When rapidly cooled,\r\nas on the surface of a lava flow, molten rock chills to a glass,\r\nbecause the minerals of which it is composed have not had time to\r\nseparate themselves from the fused mixture and form crystals. Under\r\nslow cooling, as in the interior of the flow, it becomes a stony mass\r\ncomposed of crystals set in a glassy paste. In thin slices of volcanic\r\nglass one may see under the microscope the beginnings of crystal\r\ngrowth in filaments and needles and feathery forms, which are the\r\nrudiments of the crystals of various minerals.\r\n\r\nSpherulites, which also mark the first changes of glassy lavas toward\r\na stony condition, are little balls within the rock, varying from\r\nmicroscopic size to several inches in diameter, and made up of\r\nradiating fibers.\r\n\r\nPerlitic structure, common among glassy lavas, consists of microscopic\r\ncurving and interlacing cracks, due to contraction.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 224. Perlitic Structure and Spherulites,\r\n       _a_, _a_]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 225. Flow Lines in Lava]\r\n\r\n=Flow lines= are exhibited by volcanic rocks both to the naked eye and\r\nunder the microscope. Steam blebs, together with crystals and their\r\nembryonic forms, are left arranged in lines and streaks by the\r\ncurrents of the flowing lava as it stiffened into rock.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 226. Porphyritic Structure]\r\n\r\n=Porphyritic structure.= Rocks whose ground mass has scattered through\r\nit large conspicuous crystals (Fig. 226) are said to be _porphyritic_,\r\nand it is especially among volcanic rocks that this structure occurs.\r\nThe ground mass of porphyries either may be glassy or may consist in\r\npart of a felt of minute crystals; in either case it represents the\r\nconsolidation of the rock after its outpouring upon the surface. On\r\nthe other hand, the large crystals of porphyry have slowly formed deep\r\nbelow the ground at an earlier date.\r\n\r\n=Columnar structure.= Just as wet starch contracts on drying to\r\nprismatic forms, so lava often contracts on cooling to a mass of\r\nclose-set, prismatic, and commonly six-sided columns, which stand at\r\nright angles to the cooling surface. The upper portion of a flow, on\r\nrapid cooling from the surface exposed to the air, may contract to a\r\nconfused mass of small and irregular prisms; while the remainder forms\r\nlarge and beautifully regular columns, which have grown upward by slow\r\ncooling from beneath (Fig. 227).\r\n\r\n\r\nFragmental Materials\r\n\r\nRocks weighing many tons are often thrown from a volcano at the\r\nbeginning of an outburst by the breaking up of the solidified floor of\r\nthe crater; and during the progress of an eruption large blocks may be\r\ntorn from the throat of the volcano by the outrush of steam. But the\r\nmost important fragmental materials are those derived from the lava\r\nitself. As lava rises in the pipe, the steam which permeates it is\r\nreleased from pressure and explodes, hurling the lava into the air in\r\nfragments of all sizes,--large pieces of scoria, _lapilli_ (fragments\r\nthe size of a pea or walnut), volcanic \"sand\" and volcanic \"ashes.\"\r\nThe latter resemble in appearance the ashes of wood or coal, but they\r\nare not in any sense, like them, a residue after combustion.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 227. Columnar Structure in Basaltic Lava,\r\n      Scotland]\r\n\r\nVolcanic ashes are produced in several ways: lava rising in the\r\nvolcanic duct is exploded into fine dust by the steam which permeates\r\nit; glassy lava, hurled into the air and cooled suddenly, is brought\r\ninto a state of high strain and tension, and, like Prince Rupert's\r\ndrops, flies to pieces at the least provocation. The clash of rising\r\nand falling projectiles also produces some dust, a fair sample of\r\nwhich may be made by grating together two pieces of pumice.\r\n\r\nBeds of volcanic ash occur widely among recent deposits in the western\r\nUnited States. In Nebraska ash beds are found in twenty counties, and\r\nare often as white as powdered pumice. The beds grow thicker and\r\ncoarser toward the southwestern part of the state, where their\r\nthickness sometimes reaches fifty feet. In what direction would you\r\nlook for the now extinct volcano whose explosive eruptions are thus\r\nrecorded?\r\n\r\n=Tuff.= This is a convenient term designating any rock composed of\r\nvolcanic fragments. Coarse tuffs of angular fragments are called\r\n_volcanic breccia_, and when the fragments have been rounded and sorted\r\nby water the rock is termed a _volcanic conglomerate_. Even when\r\ndeposited in the open air, as on the slopes of a volcano, tuffs may be\r\nrudely bedded and their fragments more or less rounded, and unless\r\nmarine shells or the remains of land plants and animals are found as\r\nfossils in them, there is often considerable difficulty in telling\r\nwhether they were laid in water or in air. In either case they soon\r\nbecome consolidated. Chemical deposits from percolating waters fill\r\nthe interstices, and the bed of loose fragments is cemented to hard\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nThe materials of which tuffs are composed are easily recognized as\r\nvolcanic in their origin. The fragments are more or less cellular,\r\naccording to the degree to which they were distended with steam when\r\nin a molten state, and even in the finest dust one may see the glass\r\nor the crystals of lava from which it was derived. Tuffs often contain\r\n_volcanic bombs_,--balls of lava which took shape while whirling in\r\nthe air, and solidified before falling to the ground.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 228. Volcanic Bombs, Cinder Cone, California]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 229. A Volcanic Cone, Arizona]\r\n\r\n=Ancient volcanic rocks.= It is in these materials and structures\r\nwhich we have described that volcanoes leave some of their most\r\nenduring records. Even the volcanic rocks of the earliest geological\r\nages, uplifted after long burial beneath the sea and exposed to view\r\nby deep erosion, are recognized and their history read despite the\r\nmany changes which they may have undergone. A sheet of ancient lava\r\nmay be distinguished by its composition from the sediments among which\r\nit is imbedded. The direction of its flow lines may be noted. The\r\ncellular and slaggy surface where the pasty lava was distended by\r\nescaping steam is recognized by the amygdules which now fill the\r\nancient steam blebs. In a pile of successive sheets of lava each flow\r\nmay be distinguished and its thickness measured; for the surface of\r\neach sheet is glassy and scoriaceous, while beneath its upper portions\r\nthe lava of each flow is more dense and stony. The length of time\r\nwhich elapsed before a sheet was buried beneath the materials of\r\nsucceeding eruptions may be told by the amount of weathering which it\r\nhad undergone, the depth of ancient soil--now baked to solid\r\nrock--upon it, and the erosion which it had suffered in the interval.\r\n\r\nIf the flow occurred from some submarine volcano, we may recognize the\r\nfact by the sea-laid sediments which cover it, filling the cracks and\r\ncrevices of its upper surface and containing pieces of lava washed\r\nfrom it in their basal layers.\r\n\r\nLong-buried glassy lavas devitrify, or pass to a stony condition,\r\nunder the unceasing action of underground waters; but their flow lines\r\nand perlitic and spherulitic structures remain to tell of their\r\noriginal state.\r\n\r\nAncient tuffs are known by the fragmental character of their volcanic\r\nmaterial, even though they have been altered to firm rock. Some\r\nremains of land animals and plants may be found imbedded to tell that\r\nthe beds were laid in open air; while the remains of marine organisms\r\nwould prove as surely that the tuffs were deposited in the sea.\r\n\r\nIn these ways ancient volcanoes have been recognized near Boston, in\r\nsoutheastern Pennsylvania, about Lake Superior, and in other regions\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Life History of a Volcano\r\n\r\nThe invasion of a region by volcanic forces is attended by movements\r\nof the crust heralded by earthquakes. A fissure or a pipe is opened\r\nand the building of the cone or the spreading of wide lava sheets is\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\n=Volcanic cones.= The shape of a volcanic cone depends chiefly on the\r\nmaterials erupted. Cones made of fragments may have sides as steep as\r\nthe angle of repose, which in the case of coarse scoria is sometimes\r\nas high as thirty or forty degrees. About the base of the mountain the\r\nfiner materials erupted are spread in more gentle slopes, and are also\r\nwashed forward by rains and streams. The normal profile is thus a\r\nsymmetric cone with a flaring base.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 230. Sarcoui, a Trachyte Dome, France]\r\n\r\nCones built of lava vary in form according to the liquidity of the\r\nlava. Domes of gentle slope, as those of Hawaii, for example, are\r\nformed of basalt, which flows to long distances before it congeals.\r\nWhen superheated and emitted from many vents, this easily melted lava\r\nbuilds great plateaus, such as that of Iceland. On the other hand,\r\nlavas less fusible, or poured out at a lower temperature, stiffen when\r\nthey have flowed but a short distance, and accumulate in a steep cone.\r\nTrachyte has been extruded in a state so viscid that it has formed\r\nsteep-sided domes like that of Sarcoui (Fig. 230).\r\n\r\nMost volcanoes are built, like Vesuvius, both of lava flows and of\r\ntuffs, and sections show that the structure of the cone consists of\r\noutward-dipping, alternating layers of lava, scoria, and ashes.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 231. Section of Vesuvius\r\n\r\n    _V_, Vesuvius; _S_, Somma, a mountainous rampart half encircling\r\n    Vesuvius, and like it built of outward-dipping sheets of tuff and\r\n    lava; _a_, crystalline rocks; _b_, marine strata; _c_, tuffs\r\n    containing seashells. Which is the older mountain, Vesuvius or\r\n    Somma? Of what is Somma a remnant? Draw a diagram showing its\r\n    original outline. Suggest what processes may have brought it to its\r\n    present form. What record do you find of the earliest volcanic\r\n    activity? What do you infer as to the beginnings of the volcano?]\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the cone is rent by the violence of explosions and\r\nby the weight of the column of lava in the pipe. The fissures are\r\nfilled with lava and some discharge on the sides of the mountain,\r\nbuilding parasitic cones, while all form dikes, which strengthen the\r\npile with ribs of hard rock and make it more difficult to rend.\r\n\r\nGreat catastrophes are recorded in the shape of some volcanoes which\r\nconsist of a circular rim perhaps miles in diameter, inclosing a vast\r\ncrater or a caldera within which small cones may rise. We may infer\r\nthat at some time the top of the mountain has been blown off, or has\r\ncollapsed and been engulfed because some reservoir beneath had been\r\nemptied by long-continued eruptions (Fig. 230).\r\n\r\nThe cone-building stage may be said to continue until eruptions of\r\nlava and fragmental materials cease altogether. Sooner or later the\r\nvolcanic forces shift or die away, and no further eruptions add to the\r\npile or replace its losses by erosion during periods of repose. Gases\r\nhowever are still emitted, and, as sulphur vapors are conspicuous\r\namong them, such vents are called _solfataras_. Mount Hood, in Oregon,\r\nis an example of a volcano sunk to this stage. From a steaming rift on\r\nits side there rise sulphurous fumes which, half a mile down the wind,\r\nwill tarnish a silver coin.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 232. Crater Lake, Oregon\r\n\r\n   How wide and deep is the basin which holds the lake? The\r\n   mountain walls which enclose it are made of outward-dipping\r\n   sheets of lava. Draw a diagram restoring the volcano of which\r\n   they are the remnant. No volcanic fragments of the same nature\r\n   as the materials of which the volcano is built are found about\r\n   the region. What theory of the destruction of the cone does\r\n   this fact favor? _W´_, Wizard Island, is a cinder cone. When was\r\n   it built?]\r\n\r\n=Geysers and hot springs.= The hot springs of volcanic regions are\r\namong the last vestiges of volcanic heat. Periodically eruptive\r\nboiling springs are termed geysers. In each of the geyser regions of\r\nthe earth--the Yellowstone National Park, Iceland, and New\r\nZealand--the ground water of the locality is supposed to be heated by\r\nancient lavas that, because of the poor conductivity of the rock,\r\nstill remain hot beneath the surface.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 233. Old Faithful Geyser in Eruption,\r\n      Yellowstone National Park]\r\n\r\n=Old Faithful=, one of the many geysers of the Yellowstone National\r\nPark, plays a fountain of boiling water a hundred feet in air; while\r\nclouds of vapor from the escaping steam ascend to several times that\r\nheight. The eruptions take place at intervals of from seventy to\r\nninety minutes. In repose the geyser is a quiet pool, occupying a\r\ncraterlike depression in a conical mound some twelve feet high. The\r\nconduit of the spring is too irregular to be sounded. The mound is\r\ncomposed of porous silica deposited by the waters of the geyser.\r\n\r\nGeysers erupt at intervals instead of continuously boiling, because\r\ntheir long, narrow, and often tortuous conduits do not permit a free\r\ncirculation of the water. After an eruption the tube is refilled and\r\nthe water again gradually becomes heated. Deep in the tube where it is\r\nin contact with hot lavas the water sooner or later reaches the\r\nboiling point, and bursting into steam shoots the water above it high\r\nin air.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 234. Terrace and Cones of Siliceous Sinter\r\n      deposited by Geysers, Yellowstone National Park]\r\n\r\n=Carbonated springs.= After all the other signs of life have gone, the\r\nancient volcano may emit carbon dioxide as its dying breath. The\r\nsprings of the region may long be charged with carbon dioxide, or\r\ncarbonated, and where they rise through limestone may be expected to\r\ndeposit large quantities of travertine. We should remember, however,\r\nthat many carbonated springs, and many hot springs, are wholly\r\nindependent of volcanoes.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 235. Mount Shasta, California]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 236. Mount Hood, Oregon]\r\n\r\n=The destruction of the cone.= As soon as the volcanic cone ceases to\r\ngrow by eruptions the agents of erosion begin to wear it down, and the\r\nlength of time that has elapsed since the period of active growth may\r\nbe roughly measured by the degree to which the cone has been\r\ndissected. We infer that Mount Shasta, whose conical shape is still\r\npreserved despite the gullies one thousand feet deep which trench its\r\nsides (Fig. 235), is younger than Mount Hood, which erosive agencies\r\nhave carved to a pyramidal form (Fig. 236). The pile of materials\r\naccumulated about a volcanic vent, no matter how vast in bulk, is at\r\nlast swept entirely away. The cone of the volcano, active or extinct,\r\nis not old as the earth counts time; volcanoes are short-lived\r\ngeological phenomena.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 237. Crandall Volcano]\r\n\r\n=Crandall volcano.= This name is given to a dissected ancient volcano\r\nin the Yellowstone National Park, which once, it is estimated, reared\r\nits head thousands of feet above the surrounding country and greatly\r\nexceeded in bulk either Mount Shasta or Mount Etna. Not a line of the\r\noriginal mountain remains; all has been swept away by erosion except\r\nsome four thousand feet of the base of the pile. This basal wreck now\r\nappears as a rugged region about thirty miles in diameter, trenched by\r\ndeep valleys and cut into sharp peaks and precipitous ridges. In the\r\ncenter of the area is found the nucleus (_N_, Fig. 237),--a mass of\r\ncoarsely crystalline rock that congealed deep in the old volcanic\r\npipe. From it there radiate in all directions, like the spokes of a\r\nwheel, long dikes whose rock grows rapidly finer of grain as it leaves\r\nthe vicinity of the once heated core. The remainder of the base of the\r\nancient mountain is made of rudely bedded tuffs and volcanic breccia,\r\nwith occasional flows of lava, some of the fragments of the breccia\r\nmeasuring as much as twenty feet in diameter. On the sides of canyons\r\nthe breccia is carved by rain erosion to fantastic pinnacles. At\r\ndifferent levels in the midst of these beds of tuff and lava are many\r\nold forest grounds. The stumps and trunks of the trees, now turned to\r\nstone, still in many cases stand upright where once they grew on the\r\nslopes of the mountain as it was building (Fig. 238). The great size\r\nand age of some of these trees indicate, the lapse of time between the\r\neruption whose lavas or tuffs weathered to the soil on which they grew\r\nand the subsequent eruption which buried them beneath showers of\r\nstones and ashes.\r\n\r\nNear the edge of the area lies Death Gulch, in which carbon dioxide is\r\ngiven off in such quantities that in quiet weather it accumulates in a\r\nheavy layer along the ground and suffocates the animals which may\r\nenter it.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 238. Fossil Tree Trunks, Yellowstone National Park]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nUNDERGROUND STRUCTURES OF IGNEOUS ORIGIN\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is because long-continued erosion lays bare the innermost anatomy\r\nof an extinct volcano, and even sweeps away the entire pile with much\r\nof the underlying strata, thus leaving the very roots of the volcano\r\nopen to view, that we are able to study underground volcanic\r\nstructures. With these we include, for convenience, intrusions of\r\nmolten rock which have been driven upward into the crust, but which\r\nmay not have succeeded in breaking way to the surface and establishing\r\na volcano. All these structures are built of rock forced when in a\r\nfluid or pasty state into some cavity which it has found or made, and\r\nwe may classify them therefore, according to the shape of the molds in\r\nwhich the molten rock has congealed, as (1) dikes, (2) volcanic necks,\r\n(3) intrusive sheets, and (4) intrusive masses.\r\n\r\n=Dikes.= The sheet of once molten rock with which a fissure has been\r\nfilled is known as a dike. Dikes are formed when volcanic cones are\r\nrent by explosions or by the weight of the lava column in the duct,\r\nand on the dissection of the pile they appear as radiating vertical\r\nribs cutting across the layers of lava and tuff of which the cone is\r\nbuilt. In regions undergoing deformation rocks lying deep below the\r\nground are often broken and the fissures are filled with molten rock\r\nfrom beneath, which finds no outlet to the surface. Such dikes are\r\ncommon in areas of the most ancient rocks, which have been brought to\r\nlight by long erosion.\r\n\r\nIn exceptional cases dikes may reach the length of fifty or one\r\nhundred miles. They vary in width from a fraction of a foot to even as\r\nmuch as three hundred feet.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 239. Dikes, Spanish Peaks, Colorado]\r\n\r\nDikes are commonly more fine of grain on the sides than in the center,\r\nand may have a glassy and crackled surface where they meet the\r\ninclosing rock. Can you account for this on any principle which you\r\nhave learned?\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 240. A Dissected Volcanic Cone\r\n\r\n   _N_, volcanic neck; _l_, _l_, lava-topped table mountains;\r\n   _t_, _t_, beds of tuff; _d_, _d_, dikes; dotted lines indicate\r\n   the initial profile]\r\n\r\n=Volcanic necks.= The pipe of a volcano rises from far below the base\r\nof the cone,--from the deep reservoir from which its eruptions are\r\nsupplied. When the volcano has become extinct this great tube remains\r\nfilled with hardened lava. It forms a cylindrical core of solid rock,\r\nexcept for some distance below the ancient crater, where it may\r\ncontain a mass of fragments which had fallen back into the chimney\r\nafter being hurled into the air.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 241. Mount Johnson, a Volcanic Neck near\r\n      Montreal]\r\n\r\nAs the mountain is worn down, this central column known as the\r\n_volcanic neck_ is left standing as a conical hill (Fig. 240). Even\r\nwhen every other trace of the volcano has been swept away, erosion\r\nwill not have passed below this great stalk on which the volcano was\r\nborne as a fiery flower whose site it remains to mark. In volcanic\r\nregions of deep denudation volcanic necks rise solitary and abrupt\r\nfrom the surrounding country as dome-shaped hills. They are marked\r\nfeatures in the landscape in parts of Scotland and in the St. Lawrence\r\nvalley about Montreal (Fig. 241).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 242. The Palisades of the Hudson, New Jersey]\r\n\r\n=Intrusive sheets.= Sheets of igneous rocks are sometimes found\r\ninterleaved with sedimentary strata, especially in regions where the\r\nrocks have been deformed and have suffered from volcanic action. In\r\nsome instances such a sheet is seen to be _contemporaneous_ (p. 248).\r\nIn other instances the sheet must be _intrusive_. The overlying\r\nstratum, as well as that beneath, has been affected by the heat of the\r\nonce molten rock. We infer that the igneous rock when in a molten\r\nstate was forced between the strata, much as a card may be pushed\r\nbetween the leaves of a closed book. The liquid wedged its way between\r\nthe layers, lifting those above to make room for itself. The source of\r\nthe intrusive sheet may often be traced to some dike (known therefore\r\nas the _feeding dike_), or to some mass of igneous rock.\r\n\r\nIntrusive sheets may extend a score and more of miles, and, like the\r\nlongest surface flows, the most extensive sheets consist of the more\r\nfusible and fluid lavas,--those of the basic class of which basalt is\r\nan example. Intrusive sheets are usually harder than the strata in\r\nwhich they lie and are therefore often left in relief after long\r\ndenudation of the region (Fig. 315).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 243. Diagram of the Palisades of the Hudson\r\n\r\n   _i_, intrusive sheet; _s_, sandstone; _d_, feeding dike;\r\n   _HR_, Hudson River]\r\n\r\nOn the west bank of the Hudson there extends from New York Bay north\r\nfor thirty miles a bold cliff several hundred feet high,--the\r\n_Palisades of the Hudson_. It is the outcropping edge of a sheet of\r\nancient igneous rock, which rests on stratified sandstones and is\r\noverlain by strata of the same series. Sandstones and lava sheet\r\ntogether dip gently to the west and the latter disappears from view\r\ntwo miles back from the river.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting question whether the Palisades sheet is\r\n_contemporaneous_ or _intrusive_. Was it outpoured on the sandstones\r\nbeneath it when they formed the floor of the sea, and covered\r\nforthwith by the sediments of the strata above, or was it intruded\r\namong these beds at a later date?\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 244. Section of Electric Peak. E. and Gray\r\n      Peak, G, Yellowstone National Park\r\n\r\n   Intrusive sheets and masses of igneous rock are drawn in black]\r\n\r\nThe latter is the case: for the overlying stratum is intensely baked\r\nalong the zone of contact. At the west edge of the sheet is found the\r\ndike in which the lava rose to force its way far and wide between the\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\n_Electric Peak_, one of the prominent mountains of the Yellowstone\r\nNational Park, is carved out of a mass of strata into which many\r\nsheets of molten rock have been intruded. The western summit consists\r\nof such a sheet several hundred feet thick. Studying the section of\r\nFigure 244, what inference do you draw as to the source of these\r\nintrusive sheets?\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 245. Stone Mountain, Georgia, a Granite Boss]\r\n\r\n\r\nIntrusive Masses\r\n\r\n=Bosses.= This name is generally applied to huge irregular masses of\r\ncoarsely crystalline igneous rock lying in the midst of other\r\nformations. Bosses vary greatly in size and may reach scores of miles\r\nin extent. Seldom are there any evidences found that bosses ever had\r\nconnection with the surface. On the other hand, it is often proved\r\nthat they have been driven, or have melted their way, upward into the\r\nformations in which they lie; for they give off dikes and intrusive\r\nsheets, and have profoundly altered the rocks about them by their\r\nheat.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 246. Map of Granite Bosses near Baltimore\r\n      (areas horizontally Lined)\r\n\r\nThe texture of the rock of bosses proves that consolidation proceeded\r\nslowly and at great depths, and it is only because of vast denudation\r\nthat they are now exposed to view. Bosses are commonly harder than the\r\nrocks about them, and stand up, therefore, as rounded hills and\r\nmountainous ridges long after the surrounding country has worn to a\r\nlow plain (Fig. 245).\r\n\r\nFigure 246 exhibits a few small bosses of granite near Baltimore as\r\nexamples of numerous areas of igneous rock within the Piedmont Belt\r\nwhich represent bodies of molten rock which solidified deep below the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe _Spanish Peaks_ of southeastern Colorado were formed by the\r\nupthrust of immense masses of igneous rock, bulging and breaking the\r\noverlying strata. On one side of the mountains the throw of the fault\r\nis nearly a mile, and fragments of deep-lying beds were dragged upward\r\nby the rising masses. The adjacent rocks were altered by heat to a\r\ndistance of several thousand feet. No evidence appears that the molten\r\nrock ever reached the surface, and if volcanic eruptions ever took\r\nplace either in lava flows or fragmental materials, all traces of them\r\nhave been effaced. The rock of the intrusive masses is coarsely\r\ncrystalline, and no doubt solidified slowly under the pressure of vast\r\nthicknesses of overlying rock, now mostly removed by erosion.\r\n\r\nA magnificent system of dikes radiates from the Peaks to a distance of\r\nfifteen miles, some now being left by long erosion as walls a hundred\r\nfeet in height (Fig. 239). Intrusive sheets fed by the dikes penetrate\r\nthe surrounding strata, and their edges are cut by canyons as much as\r\ntwenty-five miles from the mountain. In these strata are valuable beds\r\nof lignite, an imperfect coal, which the heat of dikes and sheets has\r\nchanged to coke.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 247. Section of a Laccolith]\r\n\r\n=Laccoliths.= The laccolith (Greek laccos, cistern; lithos, stone) is\r\na variety of intrusive masses in which molten rock has spread between\r\nthe strata, and, lifting the strata above it to a dome-shaped form,\r\nhas collected beneath them in a lens-shaped body with a flat base.\r\n\r\nThe _Henry Mountains_, a small group of detached peaks in southern\r\nUtah, rise from a plateau of horizontal rocks. Some of the peaks are\r\ncarved wholly in separate domelike uplifts of the strata of the\r\nplateau. In others, as Mount Hillers, the largest of the group, there\r\nis exposed on the summit a core of igneous rock from which the\r\nsedimentary rocks of the flanks dip steeply outward in all directions.\r\nIn still others erosion has stripped off the covering strata and has\r\nlaid bare the core to its base; and its shape is here seen to be that\r\nof a plano-convex lens or a baker's bun, its flat base resting on the\r\nundisturbed bedded rocks beneath. The structure of Mount Hillers is\r\nshown in Figure 248. The nucleus of igneous rock is four miles in\r\ndiameter and more than a mile in depth.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 248. Section of Mount Hillers]\r\n\r\n=Regional intrusions.= These vast bodies of igneous rock, which may\r\nreach hundreds of miles in diameter, differ little from bosses except\r\nin their immense bulk. Like bosses, regional intrusions give off dikes\r\nand sheets and greatly change the rocks about them by their heat. They\r\nare now exposed to view only because of the profound denudation which\r\nhas removed the upheaved dome of rocks beneath which they slowly\r\ncooled. Such intrusions are accompanied--whether as cause or as\r\neffect is still hardly known--by deformations, and their masses of\r\nigneous rock are thus found as the core of many great mountain ranges.\r\nThe granitic masses of which the Bitter Root Mountains and the Sierra\r\nNevadas have been largely carved are each more than three hundred\r\nmiles in length. Immense regional intrusions, the cores of once lofty\r\nmountain ranges, are found upon the Laurentian peneplain.\r\n\r\n=Physiographic effects of intrusive masses.= We have already seen\r\nexamples of the topographic effects of intrusive masses in Mount\r\nHillers, the Spanish Peaks, and in the great mountain ranges mentioned\r\nin the paragraph on regional intrusions, although in the latter\r\ninstances these effects are entangled with the effects of other\r\nprocesses. Masses of igneous rock cannot be intruded within the crust\r\nwithout an accompanying deformation on a scale corresponding to the\r\nbulk of the intruded mass. The overlying strata are arched into hills\r\nor mountains, or, if the molten material is of great extent, the\r\nstrata may conceivably be floated upward to the height of a plateau.\r\nWe may suppose that the transference of molten matter from one region\r\nto another may be among the causes of slow subsidences and elevations.\r\nIntrusions give rise to fissures, dikes, and intrusive sheets, and\r\nthese dislocations cannot fail to produce earthquakes. Where intrusive\r\nmasses open communication with the surface, volcanoes are established\r\nor fissure eruptions occur such as those of Iceland.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Intrusive Rocks\r\n\r\nThe igneous rocks are divided into two general classes,--the\r\n_volcanic_ or _eruptive_ rocks, which have been outpoured in open air\r\nor on the floor of the sea, and the _intrusive_ rocks, which have been\r\nintruded within the rocks of the crust and have solidified below the\r\nsurface. The two classes are alike in chemical composition and may be\r\ndivided into acidic and basic groups. In texture the intrusive rocks\r\ndiffer from the volcanic rocks because of the different conditions\r\nunder which they have solidified. They cooled far more slowly beneath\r\nthe cover of the rocks into which they were pressed than is permitted\r\nto lava flows in open air. Their constituent minerals had ample\r\nopportunity to sort themselves and crystallize from the fluid mixture,\r\nand none of that mixture was left to congeal as a glassy paste.\r\n\r\nThey consolidated also under pressure. They are never scoriaceous, for\r\nthe steam with which they were charged was not allowed to expand and\r\ndistend them with steam blebs. In the rocks of the larger intrusive\r\nmasses one may see with a powerful microscope exceedingly minute\r\ncavities, to be counted by many millions to the cubic inch, in which\r\nthe gaseous water which the mass contained was held imprisoned under\r\nthe immense pressure of the overlying rocks.\r\n\r\nNaturally these characteristics are best developed in the intrusives\r\nwhich cooled most slowly, i.e. in the deepest-seated and largest\r\nmasses; while in those which cooled more rapidly, as in dikes and\r\nsheets, we find gradations approaching the texture of surface flows.\r\n\r\n=Varieties of the intrusive rocks.= We will now describe a few of the\r\nvarieties of rocks of deep-seated intrusions. All are even grained,\r\nconsisting of a mass of crystalline grains formed during one\r\ncontinuous stage of solidification, and no porphyritic crystals appear\r\nas in lavas.\r\n\r\n_Granite_, as we have learned already, is composed of three\r\nminerals,--quartz, feldspar, and mica. According to the color of the\r\nfeldspar the rock may be red, or pink, or gray. Hornblende--a black or\r\ndark green mineral, an iron-magnesian silicate, about as hard as\r\nfeldspar--is sometimes found as a fourth constituent, and the rock is\r\nthen known as _hornblendic granite_. Granite is an acidic rock\r\ncorresponding to rhyolite in chemical composition. We may believe that\r\nthe same molten mass which supplies this acidic lava in surface flows\r\nsolidifies as granite deep below ground in the volcanic reservoir.\r\n\r\n_Syenite_, composed of feldspar and mica, has consolidated from a less\r\nsiliceous mixture than has granite.\r\n\r\n_Diorite_, still less siliceous, is composed of hornblende and\r\nfeldspar,--the latter mineral being of different variety from the\r\nfeldspar of granite and syenite.\r\n\r\n_Gabbro_, a typical basic rock, corresponds to basalt in chemical\r\ncomposition. It is a dark, heavy, coarsely crystalline aggregate of\r\nfeldspar and _augite_ (a dark mineral allied to hornblende). It often\r\ncontains _magnetite_ (the magnetic black oxide of iron) and _olivine_\r\n(a greenish magnesian silicate).\r\n\r\nIn the northern states all these types, and many others also of the\r\nvast number of varieties of intrusive rocks, can be found among the\r\nrocks of the drift brought from the areas of igneous rock in Canada\r\nand the states of our northern border.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 249.

In all\r\nthe past, under pressures inconceivably great, molten rock has been\r\ndriven upward into the rocks of the crust. It has squeezed into\r\nfissures forming dikes; it has burrowed among the strata as intrusive\r\nsheets; it has melted the rocks away or lifted the overlying strata,\r\nfilling the chambers which it has made with intrusive masses. During\r\nall geological ages molten rock has found way to the surface, and\r\nvolcanoes have darkened the sky with clouds of ashes and poured\r\nstreams of glowing lava down their sides. The older strata,--the\r\nstrata which have been most deeply buried,--and especially those which\r\nhave suffered most from folding and from fracture, show the largest\r\namount of igneous intrusions. The molten rock which has been driven\r\nfrom the earth's interior to within the crust or to the surface during\r\ngeologic time must be reckoned in millions of cubic miles.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 251.\r\n\r\n   1, limestone; 2, tuff; 3, 5, 7, shale with marine shells; 4, 6,\r\n   lava, dotted portions scoriaceous.

Is the\r\n   direction of the columns that which would obtain in the\r\n   cylindrical pipe of a volcano? The tower is probably the\r\n   remnant of a small laccolith, an outlying member of a group of\r\n   laccoliths situated not far distant]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Interior Condition of the Earth and Causes of Vulcanism and\r\nDeformation\r\n\r\nThe problems of volcanoes and of deformation are so closely connected\r\nwith that of the earth's interior that we may consider them together.\r\nFew of these problems are solved, and we may only state some known\r\nfacts and the probable conclusions which may be drawn as inferences\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\n=The interior of the earth is hot.= Volcanoes prove that in many parts\r\nof the earth there exist within reach of the surface regions of such\r\nintense heat that the rock is in a molten condition. Deep wells and\r\nmines show everywhere an increase in temperature below the surface\r\nshell affected by the heat of summer and the cold of winter,--a shell\r\nin temperate latitudes sixty or seventy feet thick. Thus in a boring\r\nmore than a mile deep at Schladebach, Germany, the earth grows warmer\r\nat the rate of 1° F. for every sixty-seven feet as we descend. Taking\r\nthe average rate of increase at one degree for every sixty feet of\r\ndescent, and assuming that this rate, observed at the moderate\r\ndistances open to observation, continues to at least thirty-five\r\nmiles, the temperature at that depth must be more than three thousand\r\ndegrees,--a temperature at which all ordinary rocks would melt at the\r\nearth's surface. The rate of increase in temperature probably lessens\r\nas we go downward, and it may not be appreciable below a few hundred\r\nmiles. But there is no reason to doubt that _the interior of the earth\r\nis intensely hot_. Below a depth of one or two score miles we may\r\nimagine the rocks everywhere glowing with heat.\r\n\r\nAlthough the heat of the interior is great enough to melt all rocks at\r\natmospheric pressure, it does not follow that the interior is fluid.\r\nPressure raises the fusing point of rocks, and the weight of the crust\r\nmay keep the interior in what may be called a solid state, although so\r\nhot as to be a liquid or a gas were the pressure to be removed.\r\n\r\n=The interior of the earth is dense and heavy.= The earth behaves as a\r\nglobe more rigid than glass under the strains to which it is subjected\r\nby the attractions of the sun and moon and other heavenly bodies. The\r\njar of world-shaking earthquakes passes through the earth's interior\r\nwith nearly twice the velocity with which it would traverse solid steel,\r\nand since the speed of elastic waves depends on the density and\r\nelasticity of the medium, it follows that the globe is as a whole more\r\ndense and rigid than steel. _The interior of the earth is extremely\r\ndense and rigid._\r\n\r\nThe common rocks of the crust are about two and a half times heavier\r\nthan water, while the earth as a whole weighs five and six-tenths\r\ntimes as much as a globe of water of the same size. _The interior is\r\ntherefore much more heavy than the crust._ This may be caused in part\r\nby compression of the interior under the enormous weight of the crust,\r\nand in part also by an assortment of material, the heavier substances,\r\nsuch as the heavy metals, having gravitated towards the center.\r\n\r\nBetween the crust, which is solid because it is cool, and the\r\ninterior, which is hot enough to melt were it not for the pressure\r\nwhich keeps it dense and rigid, there may be an intermediate zone in\r\nwhich heat and pressure are so evenly balanced that here rock\r\nliquefies whenever and wherever the pressure upon it may be relieved\r\nby movements of the crust. It is perhaps from such a subcrustal layer\r\nthat the lava of volcanoes is supplied.\r\n\r\n=The causes of volcanic action.= It is now generally believed that the\r\n_heat_ of volcanoes is that of the earth's interior. Other causes,\r\nsuch as friction and crushing in the making of mountains and the\r\nchemical reactions between oxidizing agents of the crust and the\r\nunoxidized interior, have been suggested, but to most geologists they\r\nseem inadequate.\r\n\r\nThere is much difference of opinion as to the _force_ which causes\r\nmolten rock to rise to the surface in the ducts of volcanoes. Steam is\r\nso evidently concerned in explosive eruptions that many believe that\r\nlava is driven upward by the expansive force of the steam with which\r\nit is charged, much as a viscid liquid rises and boils over in a test\r\ntube or kettle.\r\n\r\nBut in quiet eruptions, and still more in the irruption of intrusive\r\nsheets and masses, there is little if any evidence that steam is the\r\ndriving force. It is therefore believed by many geologists that it is\r\n_pressure due to crustal movements and internal stresses_ which\r\nsqueezes molten rock from below into fissures and ducts in the crust.\r\nIt is held by some that where considerable water is supplied to the\r\nrising column of lava, as from the ground water of the surrounding\r\nregion, and where the lava is viscid so that steam does not readily\r\nescape, the eruption is of the explosive type; when these conditions\r\ndo not obtain, the lava outwells quietly, as in the Hawaiian\r\nvolcanoes. It is held by others not only that volcanoes are due to the\r\noutflow of the earth's deep-seated heat, but also that the steam and\r\nother emitted gases are for the most part native to the earth's\r\ninterior and never have had place in the circulation of atmospheric\r\nand ground waters.\r\n\r\n=Volcanic action and deformation.= Volcanoes do not occur on wide\r\nplains or among ancient mountains. On the other hand, where movements\r\nof the earth's crust are in progress in the uplift of high plateaus,\r\nand still more in mountain making, molten rock may reach the surface,\r\nor may be driven upward toward it forming great intrusive masses. Thus\r\nextensive lava flows accompanied the upheaval of the block mountains\r\nof western North America and the uplift of the Colorado plateau. A\r\nline of recent volcanoes may be traced along the system of rift\r\nvalleys which extends from the Jordan and Dead Sea through eastern\r\nAfrica to Lake Nyassa. The volcanoes of the Andes show how conspicuous\r\nvolcanic action may be in young rising ranges. Folded mountains often\r\nshow a core of igneous rock, which by long erosion has come to form\r\nthe axis and the highest peaks of the range, as if the molten rock had\r\nbeen squeezed up under the rising upfolds. As we decipher the records\r\nof the rocks in historical geology we shall see more fully how, in all\r\nthe past, volcanic action has characterized the periods of great\r\ncrustal movements, and how it has been absent when and where the\r\nearth's crust has remained comparatively at rest.\r\n\r\n=The causes of deformation.= As the earth's interior, or nucleus, is\r\nhighly heated it must be constantly though slowly losing its heat by\r\nconduction through the crust and into space; and since the nucleus is\r\ncooling it must also be contracting. The nucleus has contracted also\r\nbecause of the extrusion of molten matter, the loss of constituent\r\ngases given off in volcanic eruptions, and (still more important) the\r\ncompression and consolidation of its material under gravity. As the\r\nnucleus contracts, it tends to draw away from the cooled and solid\r\ncrust, and the latter settles, adapting itself to the shrinking\r\nnucleus much as the skin of a withering apple wrinkles down upon the\r\nshrunken fruit. The unsupported weight of the spherical crust develops\r\nenormous tangential pressures, similar to the stresses of an arch or\r\ndome, and when these lateral thrusts accumulate beyond the power of\r\nresistance the solid rock is warped and folded and broken.\r\n\r\nSince the planet attained its present mass it has thus been lessening\r\nin volume. Notwithstanding local and relative upheavals the earth's\r\nsurface on the whole has drawn nearer and nearer to the center. The\r\nportions of the lithosphere which have been carried down the farthest\r\nhave received the waters of the oceans, while those portions which\r\nhave been carried down the least have emerged as continents.\r\n\r\nAlthough it serves our convenience to refer the movements of the crust\r\nto the sea level as datum plane, it is understood that this level is\r\nby no means fixed. Changes in the ocean basins increase or reduce\r\ntheir capacity and thus lower or raise the level of the sea. But since\r\nthese basins are connected, the effect of any change upon the water\r\nlevel is so distributed that it is far less noticeable than a\r\ncorresponding change would be upon the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nMETAMORPHISM AND MINERAL VEINS\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the action of internal agencies rocks of all kinds may be\r\nrendered harder, more firmly cemented, and more crystalline. These\r\nprocesses are known as _metamorphism_, and the rocks affected, whether\r\noriginally sedimentary or igneous, are called _metamorphic rocks_. We\r\nmay contrast with metamorphism the action of external agencies in\r\nweathering, which render rocks less coherent by dissolving their\r\nsoluble parts and breaking down their crystalline grains.\r\n\r\n=Contact metamorphism.= Rocks beneath a lava flow or in contact with\r\nigneous intrusions are found to be metamorphosed to various degrees by\r\nthe heat of the cooling mass. The adjacent strata may be changed only\r\nin color, hardness, and texture. Thus, next to a dike, bituminous coal\r\nmay be baked to coke or anthracite, and chalk and limestone to\r\ncrystalline marble. Sandstone may be converted into quartzite, and\r\nshale into _argillite_, a compact, massive clay rock. New minerals may\r\nalso be developed. In sedimentary rocks there may be produced crystals\r\nof mica and of _garnet_ (a mineral as hard as quartz, commonly\r\noccurring in red, twelve-sided crystals). Where the changes are most\r\nprofound, rocks may be wholly made over in structure and mineral\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nIn contact metamorphism, thin sheets of molten rock produce less\r\neffect than thicker ones. The strongest heat effects are naturally\r\ncaused by bosses and regional intrusions, and the zone of change about\r\nthem may be several miles in width. In these changes heated waters and\r\nvapors from the masses of igneous rocks undoubtedly play a very\r\nimportant part.\r\n\r\nWhich will be more strongly altered, the rocks about a closed dike in\r\nwhich lava began to cool as soon as it filled the fissure, or the\r\nrocks about a dike which opened on the surface and through which the\r\nmolten rock flowed for some time?\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration the part played by heated waters, which will\r\nproduce the most far-reaching metamorphism, dikes which cut across the\r\nbedding planes or intrusive sheets which are thrust between the\r\nstrata?\r\n\r\n=Regional metamorphism.= Metamorphic rocks occur widespread in many\r\nregions, often hundreds of square miles in area, where such extensive\r\nchanges cannot be accounted for by igneous intrusions. Such are the\r\ndissected cores of lofty mountains, as the Alps, and the worn-down\r\nbases of ancient ranges, as in New England, large areas in the\r\nPiedmont Belt, and the Laurentian peneplain.\r\n\r\nIn these regions the rocks have yielded to immense pressure. They have\r\nbeen folded, crumpled, and mashed, and even their minute grains, as\r\none may see with a microscope, have often been puckered, broken, and\r\ncrushed to powder. It is to these mechanical movements and strains\r\nwhich the rocks have suffered in every part that we may attribute\r\ntheir metamorphism, and the degree to which they have been changed is\r\nin direct proportion to the degree to which they have been deformed\r\nand mashed.\r\n\r\nOther factors, however, have played important parts. Rock crushing\r\ndevelops heat, and allows a freer circulation of heated waters and\r\nvapors. Thus chemical reactions are greatly quickened; minerals are\r\ndissolved and redeposited in new positions, or their chemical\r\nconstituents may recombine in new minerals, entirely changing the\r\nnature of the rock, as when, for example, feldspar recrystallizes as\r\nquartz and mica.\r\n\r\nEarly stages of metamorphism are seen in _slate_. Pressure has\r\nhardened the marine muds, the arkose (p. 186), or the volcanic ash\r\nfrom which slates are derived, and has caused them to cleave by the\r\nrearrangement of their particles.\r\n\r\nUnder somewhat greater pressure, slate becomes _phyllite_, a clay\r\nslate whose cleavage surfaces are lustrous with flat-lying mica\r\nflakes. The same pressure which has caused the rock to cleave has set\r\nfree some of its mineral constituents along the cleavage planes to\r\ncrystallize there as mica.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 255. A Foliated Rock]\r\n\r\n=Foliation.= Under still stronger pressure the whole structure of the\r\nrock is altered. The minerals of which it is composed, and the new\r\nminerals which develop by heat and pressure, arrange themselves along\r\nplanes of cleavage or of shear in rudely parallel leaves, or _folia_.\r\nOf this structure, called _foliation_, we may distinguish two\r\ntypes,--a coarser feldspathic type, and a fine type in which other\r\nminerals than feldspar predominate.\r\n\r\n_Gneiss_ is the general name under which are comprised coarsely\r\nfoliated rocks banded with irregular layers of feldspar and other\r\nminerals. The gneisses appear to be due in many cases to the crushing\r\nand shearing of deep-seated igneous rocks, such as granite and gabbro.\r\n\r\n_The crystalline schists_, representing the finer types of foliation,\r\nconsist of thin, parallel, crystalline leaves, which are often\r\nremarkably crumpled. These folia can be distinguished from the laminae\r\nof sedimentary rocks by their lenticular form and lack of continuity,\r\nand especially by the fact that they consist of platy, crystalline\r\ngrains, and not of particles rounded by wear.\r\n\r\n_Mica schist_, the most common of schists, and in fact of all\r\nmetamorphic rocks, is composed of mica and quartz in alternating wavy\r\nfolia. All gradations between it and phyllite may be traced, and in\r\nmany cases we may prove it due to the metamorphism of slates and\r\nshales. It is widespread in New England and along the eastern side of\r\nthe Appalachians. _Talc schist_ consists of quartz and _talc_, a\r\nlight-colored magnesian mineral of greasy feel, and so soft that it\r\ncan be scratched with the thumb nail.\r\n\r\n_Hornblende schist_, resulting in many cases from the foliation of\r\nbasic igneous rocks, is made of folia of hornblende alternating with\r\nbands of quartz and feldspar. Hornblende schist is common over large\r\nareas in the Lake Superior region.\r\n\r\n_Quartz schist_ is produced from quartzite by the development of fine\r\nfolia of mica along planes of shear. All gradations may be found\r\nbetween it and unfoliated quartzite on the one hand and mica schist on\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nUnder the resistless pressure of crustal movements almost any rocks,\r\nsandstones, shales, lavas of all kinds, granites, diorites, and\r\ngabbros may be metamorphosed into schists by crushing and shearing.\r\nLimestones, however, are metamorphosed by pressure into _marble_, the\r\ngrains of carbonate of lime recrystallizing freely to interlocking\r\ncrystals of calcite.\r\n\r\nThese few examples must suffice of the great class of metamorphic\r\nrocks. As we have seen, they owe their origin to the alteration of\r\nboth of the other classes of rocks--the sedimentary and the\r\nigneous--by heat and pressure, assisted usually by the presence of\r\nwater. The fact of change is seen in their hardness arid cementation,\r\ntheir more or less complete recrystallization, and their foliation;\r\nbut the change is often so complete that no trace of their original\r\nstructure and mineral composition remains to tell whether the rocks\r\nfrom which they were derived were sedimentary or igneous, or to what\r\nvariety of either of these classes they belonged.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 256. Contorted Gneiss, the Ottawa River,\r\n      Canada]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 257. Quartz Veins in Slate]\r\n\r\nIn many cases, however, the early history of a metamorphic rock can be\r\ndeciphered. Fossils not wholly obliterated may prove it originally\r\nwater-laid. Schists may contain rolled-out pebbles, showing their\r\nderivation from a conglomerate. Dikes of igneous rocks may be followed\r\ninto a region where they have been foliated by pressure. The most\r\nthoroughly metamorphosed rocks may sometimes be traced out into\r\nunaltered sedimentary or igneous rocks, or among them may be found\r\npatches of little change where their history maybe read.\r\n\r\nMetamorphism is most common among rocks of the earlier geological\r\nages, and most rare among rocks of recent formation. No doubt it is\r\nnow in progress where deep-buried sediments are invaded by heat either\r\nfrom intrusive igneous masses or from the earth's interior, or are\r\nsuffering slow deformation under the thrust of mountain-making forces.\r\n\r\nSuggest how rocks now in process of metamorphism may sometimes be\r\nexposed to view. Why do metamorphic rocks appear on the surface\r\nto-day?\r\n\r\n\r\nMineral Veins\r\n\r\nIn regions of folded and broken rocks fissures are frequently found to\r\nbe filled with sheets of crystalline minerals deposited from solution\r\nby underground water, and fissures thus filled are known as _mineral\r\nveins_. Much of the importance of mineral veins is due to the fact\r\nthat they are often metalliferous, carrying valuable native metals and\r\nmetallic ores disseminated in fine particles, in strings, and\r\nsometimes in large masses in the midst of the valueless nonmetallic\r\nminerals which make up what is known as the _vein stone_.\r\n\r\nThe most common vein stones are _quartz_ and _calcite_. _fluorite_\r\n(calcium fluoride), a mineral harder than calcite and crystallizing in\r\ncubes of various colors, and _barite_ (barium sulphate), a heavy white\r\nmineral, are abundant in many veins.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 258. Placer Deposits in California\r\n\r\n   _g_, gold-bearing gravels in present river beds; _g´_, ancient\r\n   gold-bearing river gravels; _a_, _a_, lava flows capping table\r\n   mountains; _s_, slate. Draw a diagram showing by dotted lines\r\n   conditions before the lava flows occurred. What changes have\r\n   since taken place?]\r\n\r\nThe gold-bearing quartz veins of California traverse the metamorphic\r\nslates of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Below the zone of solution (p.\r\n45) these veins consist of a vein stone of quartz mingled with pyrite\r\n(p. 13), the latter containing threads and grains of native gold. But\r\nto the depth of about fifty feet from the surface the pyrite of the\r\nvein has been dissolved, leaving a rusty, cellular quartz with grains\r\nof the insoluble gold scattered through it.\r\n\r\nThe _placer deposits_ of California and other regions are gold-bearing\r\ndeposits of gravel and sand in river beds. The heavy gold is apt to be\r\nfound mostly near or upon the solid rock, and its grains, like those\r\nof the sand, are always rounded. How the gold came in the placers we\r\nmay leave the pupil to suggest.\r\n\r\nCopper is found in a number of ores, and also in the native metal.\r\nBelow the zone of surface changes the ore of a copper vein is often a\r\ndouble sulphide of iron and copper called _chalcopyrite_, a mineral\r\nsofter than pyrite--it can easily be scratched with a knife--and\r\ndeeper yellow in color. For several score of feet below the ground the\r\nvein may consist of rusty quartz from which the metallic ores have\r\nbeen dissolved; but at the base of the zone of solution we may find\r\nexceedingly rich deposits of copper ores,--copper sulphides, red and\r\nblack copper oxides, and green and blue copper carbonates, which have\r\nclearly been brought down in solution from the leached upper portion\r\nof the vein.\r\n\r\n=Origin of mineral veins.= Both vein stones and ores have been\r\ndeposited slowly from solution in water, much as crystals of salt are\r\ndeposited on the sides of a jar of saturated brine. In our study of\r\nunderground water we learned that it is everywhere circulating through\r\nthe permeable rocks of the crust, descending to profound depths under\r\nthe action of gravity and again driven to the surface by hydrostatic\r\npressure. Now fissures, wherever they occur, form the trunk channels\r\nof the underground circulation. Water descends from the surface along\r\nthese rifts; it moves laterally from either side to the fissure plane,\r\njust as ground water seeps through the surrounding rocks from every\r\ndirection to a well; and it ascends through these natural water ways\r\nas in an artesian well, whenever they intersect an aquifer in which\r\nwater is under hydrostatic pressure.\r\n\r\nThe waters which deposit vein stones and ores are commonly hot, and in\r\nmany cases they have derived their heat from intrusions of igneous\r\nrock still uncooled within the crust. The solvent power of the water\r\nis thus greatly increased, and it takes up into solution various\r\nsubstances from the igneous and sedimentary rocks which it traverses.\r\nFor various reasons these substances stances are deposited in the vein\r\nas ores and vein stones. On rising through the fissure the water cools\r\nand loses pressure, and its capacity to hold minerals in solution is\r\ntherefore lessened. Besides, as different currents meet in the\r\nfissure, some ascending, some descending, and some coming in from the\r\nsides, the chemical reaction of these various weak solutions upon one\r\nanother and upon the walls of the vein precipitates the minerals of\r\nvein stuffs and ores.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the method of vein deposits we may cite the case\r\nof a wooden box pipe used in the Comstock mines, Nevada, to carry the\r\nhot water of the mine from one level to another, which in ten years\r\nwas lined with calcium carbonate more than half an inch thick.\r\n\r\nThe Steamboat Springs, Nevada, furnish examples of mineral veins in\r\nprocess of formation. The steaming water rises through fissures in\r\nvolcanic rocks and is now depositing in the rifts a vein stone of\r\nquartz, with metallic ores of iron, mercury, lead, and other metals.\r\n\r\n=Reconcentration.= Near the base of the zone of solution veins are\r\noften stored with exceptionally large and valuable ore deposits. This\r\nlocal enrichment of the vein is due to the reconcentration of its\r\nmetalliferous ores. As the surface of the land is slowly lowered by\r\nweathering and running water, the zone of solution is lowered at an\r\nequal rate and encroaches constantly on the zone of cementation. The\r\nminerals of veins are therefore constantly being dissolved along their\r\nupper portions and carried down the fissures by ground water to lower\r\nlevels, where they are redeposited.\r\n\r\nMany of the richest ore deposits are thus due to successive\r\nconcentrations: the ores were leached originally from the rocks to a\r\nlarge extent by laterally seeping waters; they were concentrated in\r\nthe ore deposits of the vein chiefly by ascending currents; they have\r\nbeen reconcentrated by descending waters in the way just mentioned.\r\n\r\n=The original source of the metals.= It is to the igneous rocks that\r\nwe may look for the original source of the metals of veins. Lavas\r\ncontain minute percentages of various metallic compounds, and no doubt\r\nthis was the case also with the igneous rocks which formed the\r\noriginal earth crust. By the erosion of the igneous rocks the metals\r\nhave been distributed among sedimentary strata, and even the sea has\r\ntaken into solution an appreciable amount of gold and other metals,\r\nbut in this widely diffused condition they are wholly useless to man.\r\nThe concentration which has made them available is due to the\r\ninteraction of many agencies. Earth movements fracturing deeply the\r\nrocks of the crust, the intrusion of heated masses, the circulation of\r\nunderground waters, have all coöperated in the concentration of the\r\nmetals of mineral veins.\r\n\r\nWhile fissure veins are the most important of mineral veins, the\r\nlatter term is applied also to any water way which has been filled by\r\nsimilar deposits from solution. Thus in soluble rocks, such as\r\nlimestones, joints enlarged by percolating water are sometimes filled\r\nwith metalliferous deposits, as, for example, the lead and zinc\r\ndeposits of the upper Mississippi valley. Even a porous aquifer may be\r\nmade the seat of mineral deposits, as in the case of some\r\ncopper-bearing and silver-bearing sandstones of New Mexico.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 260. Geological Map of the United states\r\n      and Part of Canada]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL GEOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE GEOLOGICAL RECORD\r\n\r\n\r\n=What a formation records.= We have already learned that each\r\nindividual body of stratified rock, or formation, constitutes a record\r\nof the time when it was laid. The structure and the character of the\r\nsediments of each formation tell whether the area was land or sea at\r\nthe time when they were spread; and if the former, whether the land\r\nwas river plain, or lake bed, or was covered with wind-blown sands, or\r\nby the deposits of an ice sheet. If the sediments are marine, we may\r\nknow also whether they were laid in shoal water near the shore or in\r\ndeeper water out at sea, and whether during a period of emergence, or\r\nduring a period of subsidence when the sea transgressed the land. By\r\nthe same means each formation records the stage in the cycle of\r\nerosion of the land mass from which its sediments were derived (p.\r\n185). An unconformity between two marine formations records the fact\r\nthat between the periods when they were deposited in the sea the area\r\nemerged as land and suffered erosion (p. 227). The attitude and\r\nstructure of the strata tell also of the foldings and fractures,\r\nthe deformation and the metamorphism, which they have suffered; and\r\nthe igneous rocks associated with them as lava flows and igneous\r\nintrusions add other details to the story. Each formation is thus a\r\nseparate local chapter in the geological history of the earth, and its\r\nstrata are its leaves. It contains an authentic record of the physical\r\nconditions--the geography--of the time and place when and where its\r\nsediments were laid.\r\n\r\n=Past cycles of erosion.= These chapters in the history of the planet\r\nare very numerous, although much of the record has been destroyed in\r\nvarious ways. A succession of different formations is usually seen in\r\nany considerable section of the crust, such as a deep canyon or where\r\nthe edges of upturned strata are exposed to view on the flanks of\r\nmountain ranges; and in any extensive area, such as a state of the\r\nUnion or a province of Canada, the number of formations outcropping on\r\nthe surface is large.\r\n\r\nIt is thus learned that our present continent is made up for the most\r\npart of old continental deltas. Some, recently emerged as the strata\r\nof young coastal plains, are the records of recent cycles of erosion;\r\nwhile others were deposited in the early history of the earth, and in\r\nmany instances have been crumpled into mountains, which afterwards\r\nwere leveled to their bases and lowered beneath the sea to receive a\r\ncover of later sediments before they were again uplifted to form land.\r\n\r\nThe cycle of erosion now in progress and recorded in the layers of\r\nstratified rock being spread beneath the sea in continental deltas has\r\ntherefore been preceded by many similar cycles. Again and again\r\nmovements of the crust have brought to an end one cycle--sometimes\r\nwhen only well under way, and sometimes when drawing toward its\r\nclose--and have begun another. Again and again they have added to the\r\nland areas which before were sea, with all their deposition records of\r\nearlier cycles, or have lowered areas of land beneath the sea to\r\nreceive new sediments.\r\n\r\n=The age of the earth.= The thickness of the stratified rocks now\r\nexposed upon the eroded surface of the continents is very great. In\r\nthe Appalachian region the strata are seven or eight miles thick, and\r\nstill greater thicknesses have been measured in several other mountain\r\nranges. The aggregate thickness of all the formations of the\r\nstratified rocks of the earth's crust, giving to each formation its\r\nmaximum thickness wherever found, amounts to not less than forty\r\nmiles. Knowing how slowly sediments accumulate upon the sea floor\r\n(p. 184), we must believe that the successive cycles which the earth\r\nhas seen stretch back into a past almost inconceivably remote, and\r\nmeasure tens of millions and perhaps even hundreds of millions of\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n=How the formations are correlated and the geological record made up.=\r\nArranged in the order of their succession, the formations of the\r\nearth's crust would constitute a connected record in which the\r\ngeological history of the planet may be read, and therefore known as\r\nthe _geological record_. But to arrange the formations in their\r\nnatural order is not an easy task. A complete set of the volumes of\r\nthe record is to be found in no single region. Their leaves and\r\nchapters are scattered over the land surface of the globe. In one area\r\ncertain chapters may be found, though perhaps with many missing\r\nleaves, and with intervening chapters wanting, and these absent parts\r\nperhaps can be supplied only after long search through many other\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nAdjacent strata in any region are arranged according to the _law of\r\nsuperposition_, i.e. any stratum is younger than that on which it was\r\ndeposited, just as in a pile of paper, any sheet was laid later than\r\nthat on which it rests. Where rocks have been disturbed, their\r\noriginal attitude must be determined before the law can be applied.\r\nNor can the law of superposition be used in identifying and comparing\r\nthe strata of different regions where the formations cannot be traced\r\ncontinuously from one region to the other.\r\n\r\nThe formations of different regions are arranged in their true order\r\nby the _law of included organisms_; i.e. formations, however widely\r\nseparated, which contain a similar assemblage of fossils are\r\nequivalent and belong to the same division of geological time.\r\n\r\nThe correlation of formations by means of fossils may be explained by\r\nthe formations now being deposited about the north Atlantic.\r\nLithologically they are extremely various. On the continental shelf of\r\nNorth America limestones of different kinds are forming off Florida,\r\nand sandstones and shales from Georgia northward. Separated from them\r\nby the deep Atlantic oozes are other sedimentary deposits now\r\naccumulating along the west coast of Europe. If now all these offshore\r\nformations were raised to open air, how could they be correlated?\r\nSurely not by lithological likeness, for in this respect they would be\r\nquite diverse. All would be similar, however, in the fossils which\r\nthey contain. Some fossil species would be identical in all these\r\nformations and others would be closely allied. Making all due\r\nallowance for differences in species due to local differences in\r\nclimate and other physical causes, it would still be plain that plants\r\nand animals so similar lived at the same period of time, and that the\r\nformations in which their remains were imbedded were contemporaneous\r\nin a broad way. The presence of the bones of whales and other marine\r\nmammals would prove that the strata were laid after the appearance of\r\nmammals upon earth, and imbedded relics of man would give a still\r\ncloser approximation to their age. In the same way we correlate the\r\nearlier geological formations.\r\n\r\nFor example, in 1902 there were collected the first fossils ever found\r\non the antarctic continent. Among the dozen specimens obtained were\r\nsome fossil ammonites (a family of chambered shells) of genera which\r\nare found on other continents in certain formations classified as the\r\nCretaceous system, and which occur neither above these formations nor\r\nbelow them. On the basis of these few fossils we may be confident that\r\nthe strata in which they were found in the antarctic region were laid\r\nin the same period of geologic time as were the Cretaceous rocks of\r\nthe United States and Canada.\r\n\r\n=The record as a time scale.= By means of the law of included\r\norganisms and the law of superposition the formations of different\r\ncountries and continents are correlated and arranged in their natural\r\norder. When the geological record is thus obtained it may be used as a\r\nuniversal time scale for geological history. Geological time is\r\nseparated into divisions corresponding to the times during which the\r\nsuccessive formations were laid. The largest assemblages of formations\r\nare known as groups, while the corresponding divisions of time are\r\nknown as eras. Groups are subdivided into systems, and systems into\r\nseries. Series are divided into stages and substages,--subdivisions\r\nwhich do not concern us in this brief treatise. The corresponding\r\ndivisions of time are given in the following table.\r\n\r\n  _Strata_       _Time_\r\n\r\n   Group          Era\r\n   System         Period\r\n   Series         Epoch\r\n\r\nThe geologist is now prepared to read the physical history--the\r\ngeographical development--of any country or of any continent by means\r\nof its formations, when he has given each formation its true place in\r\nthe geological record as a time scale.\r\n\r\nThe following chart exhibits the main divisions of the record, the\r\nname given to each being given also to the corresponding time\r\ndivision. Thus we speak of the _Cambrian system_, meaning a certain\r\nsuccession of formations which are classified together because of\r\nbroad resemblances in their included organisms; and of the _Cambrian\r\nperiod_, meaning the time during which these rocks were deposited.\r\n\r\n  _Group and Era_    _System and Period_  _Series and Epoch_\r\n\r\n                                          { Recent\r\n                     { Quaternary . . . . { Pleistocene\r\n                     {\r\n  Cenozoic . . . .   {                    { Pliocene\r\n                     { Tertiary   . . . . { Miocene\r\n                                          { Eocene\r\n\r\n                     { Cretaceous\r\n  Mesozoic . . . .   { Jurassic\r\n                     { Triassic\r\n\r\n                                          { Permian\r\n                     { Carboniferous  . . { Pennsylvanian\r\n                     {                    { Mississippian\r\n  Paleozoic . . . .  { Devonian\r\n                     { Silurian\r\n                     { Ordovician\r\n                     { Cambrian\r\n\r\n  Algonkian\r\n  Archean\r\n\r\n\r\nFossils and what they teach\r\n\r\nThe geological formations contain a record still more important than\r\nthat of the geographical development of the continents; the fossils\r\nimbedded in the rocks of each formation tell of the kinds of animals\r\nand plants which inhabited the earth at that time, and from these\r\nfossils we are therefore able to construct the history of life upon\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n=Fossils.= These remains of organisms are found in the strata in all\r\ndegrees of perfection, from trails and tracks and fragmentary\r\nimpressions, to perfectly preserved shells, wood, bones, and complete\r\nskeletons. As a rule, it is only the hard parts of animals and plants\r\nwhich have left any traces in the rocks. Sometimes the original hard\r\nsubstance is preserved, but more often it has been replaced by some\r\nless soluble material. Petrifaction, as this process of slow\r\nreplacement is called, is often carried on in the most exquisite\r\ndetail. When wood, for example, is undergoing petrifaction, the woody\r\ntissue may be replaced, particle by particle, by silica in solution\r\nthrough the action of underground waters, even the microscopic\r\nstructures of the wood being perfectly reproduced. In shells\r\noriginally made of _aragonite_, a crystalline form of carbonate of\r\nlime, that mineral is usually replaced by _calcite_, a more stable\r\nform of the same substance. The most common petrifying materials are\r\ncalcite, silica, and pyrite.\r\n\r\nOften the organic substance has neither been preserved nor replaced,\r\nbut the _form_ has been retained by means of molds and casts.\r\nPermanent impressions, or molds, may be made in sediments not only by\r\nthe hard parts of organisms, but also by such soft and perishable\r\nparts as the leaves of plants, and, in the rarest instances, by the\r\nskin of animals and the feathers of birds. In fine-grained limestones\r\neven the imprints of jellyfish have been retained.\r\n\r\nThe different kinds of molds and casts may be illustrated by means of\r\na clam shell and some moist clay, the latter representing the\r\nsediments in which the remains of animals and plants are entombed.\r\nImbedding the shell in the clay and allowing the clay to harden, we\r\nhave a _mold of the exterior_ of the shell, as is seen on cutting the\r\nclay matrix in two and removing the shell from it. Filling this mold\r\nwith clay of different color, we obtain a _cast of the exterior_,\r\nwhich represents accurately the original form and surface markings of\r\nthe shell. In nature, shells and other relics of animals or plants are\r\noften removed by being dissolved by percolating waters, and the molds\r\nare either filled with sediments or with minerals deposited from\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nWhere the fossil is hollow, a _cast of the interior_ is made in the\r\nsame way. Interior casts of shells reproduce any markings on the\r\ninside of the valves, and casts of the interior of the skulls of\r\nancient vertebrates show the form and size of their brains.\r\n\r\n=Imperfection of the life record.= At the present time only the\r\nsmallest fraction of the life on earth ever gets entombed in rocks now\r\nforming. In the forest great fallen tree trunks, as well as dead\r\nleaves, decay, and only add a little to the layer of dark vegetable\r\nmold from which they grew. The bones of land animals are, for the most\r\npart, left unburied on the surface and are soon destroyed by chemical\r\nagencies. Even where, as in the swamps of river, flood plains and in\r\nother bogs, there are preserved the remains of plants, and sometimes\r\ninsects, together with the bones of some animal drowned or mired, in\r\nmost cases these swamp and bog deposits are sooner or later destroyed\r\nby the shifting channels of the stream or by the general erosion of\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nIn the sea the conditions for preservation are more favorable than on\r\nland; yet even here the proportion of animals and plants whose hard\r\nparts are fossilized is very small compared with those which either\r\ntotally decay before they are buried in slowly accumulating sediments\r\nor are ground to powder by waves and currents.\r\n\r\nWe may infer that during each period of the past, as at the present,\r\nonly a very insignificant fraction of the innumerable organisms of sea\r\nand land escaped destruction and left in continental and oceanic\r\ndeposits permanent records of their existence. Scanty as these\r\noriginal life records must have been, they have been largely destroyed\r\nby metamorphism of the rocks in which they were imbedded, by solution\r\nin underground waters, and by the vast denudation under which the\r\nsediments of earlier periods have been eroded to furnish materials for\r\nthe sedimentary records of later times. Moreover, very much of what\r\nhas escaped destruction still remains undiscovered. The immense bulk\r\nof the stratified rocks is buried and inaccessible, and the records of\r\nthe past which it contains can never be known. Comparatively few\r\noutcrops have been thoroughly searched for fossils. Although new\r\nspecies are constantly being discovered, each discovery may be\r\nconsidered as the outcome of a series of happy accidents,--that the\r\nremains of individuals of this particular species happened to be\r\nimbedded and fossilized, that they happened to escape destruction\r\nduring long ages, and that they happened to be exposed and found.\r\n\r\n=Some inferences from the records of the history of life upon the\r\nplanet.= Meager as are these records, they set forth plainly some\r\nimportant truths which we will now briefly mention.\r\n\r\n1. Each series of the stratified rocks, except the very deepest,\r\ncontains vestiges of life. Hence _the earth was tenanted by living\r\ncreatures for an uncalculated length of time before human history\r\nbegan_.\r\n\r\n2. _Life on the earth has been ever-changing._ The youngest strata hold\r\nthe remains of existing species of animals and plants and those of\r\nspecies and varieties closely allied to them. Strata somewhat older\r\ncontain fewer existing species, and in strata of a still earlier, but\r\nby no means an ancient epoch, no existing species are to be found; the\r\nspecies of that epoch and of previous epochs have vanished from the\r\nliving world. During all geological time since life began on earth old\r\nspecies have constantly become extinct and with them the genera and\r\nfamilies to which they belong, and other species, genera, and families\r\nhave replaced them. The fossils of each formation differ on the whole\r\nfrom those of every other. The assemblage of animals and plants (the\r\n_fauna-flora_) of each epoch differs from that of every other epoch.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the extinction of a type has been gradual; in other\r\ninstances apparently abrupt. There is no evidence that any organism\r\nonce become extinct has ever reappeared. The duration of a species in\r\ntime, or its \"vertical range\" through the strata, varies greatly. Some\r\nspecies are limited to a stratum a few feet in thickness; some may\r\nrange through an entire formation and be found but little modified in\r\nstill higher beds. A formation may thus often be divided into zones,\r\neach characterized by its own peculiar species. As a rule, the simpler\r\norganisms have a longer duration as species, though not as\r\nindividuals, than the more complex.\r\n\r\n3. _The larger zoölogical and botanical groupings survive longer than\r\nthe smaller._ Species are so short-lived that a single geological\r\nepoch may be marked by several more or less complete extinctions of\r\nthe species of its fauna-flora and their replacement by other species.\r\nA genus continues with new species after all the species with which it\r\nbegan have become extinct. Families survive genera, and orders\r\nfamilies. Classes are so long-lived that most of those which are known\r\nfrom the earliest formations are represented by living forms, and no\r\nsubkingdom has ever become extinct.\r\n\r\nThus, to take an example from the stony corals,--the\r\n_zoantharia_,--the particular characters--which constituted a certain\r\n_species_--_Facosites niagarensis_--of the order are confined to the\r\nNiagara series. Its _generic_ characters appeared in other species\r\nearlier in the Silurian and continued through the Devonian. Its\r\n_family_ characters, represented in different genera and species,\r\nrange from the Ordovician to the close of the Paleozoic; while the\r\ncharacters which it shares with all its order, the Zoantharia, began\r\nin the Cambrian and are found in living species.\r\n\r\n4. _The change in organisms has been gradual._ The fossils of each\r\nlife zone and of each formation of a conformable series closely\r\nresemble, with some explainable exceptions, those of the beds\r\nimmediately above and below. The animals and plants which tenanted the\r\nearth during any geological epoch are so closely related to those of\r\nthe preceding and the succeeding epochs that we may consider them to\r\nbe the descendants of the one and the ancestors of the other, thus\r\naccounting for the resemblance by heredity. It is therefore believed\r\nthat the species of animals and plants now living on the earth are the\r\ndescendants of the species whose remains we find entombed in the\r\nrocks, and that the chain of life has been unbroken since its\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\n5. _The change in species has been a gradual differentiation._ Tracing\r\nthe lines of descent of various animals and plants of the present\r\nbackward through the divisions of geologic time, we find that these\r\nlines of descent converge and unite in simpler and still simpler\r\ntypes. The development of life may be represented by a tree whose\r\ntrunk is found in the earliest ages and whose branches spread and\r\nsubdivide to the growing twigs of present species.\r\n\r\n6. _The change in organisms throughout geologic time has been a\r\nprogressive change._ In the earliest ages the only animals and plants\r\non the earth were lowly forms, simple and generalized in structure;\r\nwhile succeeding ages have been characterized by the introduction of\r\ntypes more and more specialized and complex, and therefore of higher\r\nrank in the scale of being. Thus the Algonkian contains the remains of\r\nonly the humblest forms of the invertebrates. In the Cambrian,\r\nOrdovician, and Silurian the invertebrates were represented in all\r\ntheir subkingdoms by a varied fauna. In the Devonian, fishes--the\r\nlowest of the vertebrates--became abundant. Amphibians made their\r\nentry on the stage in the Carboniferous, and reptiles came to rule the\r\nworld in the Mesozoic. Mammals culminated in the Tertiary in strange\r\nforms which became more and more like those of the present as the long\r\nages of that era rolled on; and latest of all appeared the noblest\r\nproduct of the creative process, man.\r\n\r\nJust as growth is characteristic of the individual life, so gradual,\r\nprogressive change, or evolution, has characterized the history of\r\nlife upon the planet. The evolution of the organic kingdom from its\r\nprimitive germinal forms to the complex and highly organized\r\nfauna-flora of to-day may be compared to the growth of some noble oak\r\nas it rises from the acorn, spreading loftier and more widely extended\r\nbranches as it grows.\r\n\r\n7. While higher and still higher types have continually been evolved,\r\nuntil man, the highest of all, appeared, _the lower and earlier types\r\nhave generally persisted_. Some which reached their culmination early\r\nin the history of the earth have since changed only in slight\r\nadjustments to a changing environment. Thus the brachiopods, a type of\r\nshellfish, have made no progress since the Paleozoic, and some of\r\ntheir earliest known genera are represented by living forms hardly to\r\nbe distinguished from their ancient ancestors. The lowest and earliest\r\nbranches of the tree of life have risen to no higher levels since they\r\nreached their climax of development long ago.\r\n\r\n8. A strange parallel has been found to exist between the evolution of\r\norganisms and the development of the individual. In the embryonic\r\nstages of its growth the individual passes swiftly through the\r\nsuccessive stages through which its ancestors evolved during the\r\nmillions of years of geologic time. _The development of the individual\r\nrecapitulates the evolution of the race._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe frog is a typical amphibian. As a tadpole it passes through a\r\nstage identical in several well-known features with the maturity of\r\nfishes; as, for example, its aquatic life, the tail by which it swims,\r\nand the gills through which it breathes. It is a fair inference that\r\nthe tadpole stage in the life history of the frog represents a stage\r\nin the evolution of its kind,--that the Amphibia are derived from\r\nfishlike ancestral forms. This inference is amply confirmed in the\r\ngeological record; fishes appeared before Amphibia and were connected\r\nwith them by transitional forms.\r\n\r\n=The great length of geologic time inferred from the slow change of\r\nspecies.= Life forms, like land forms, are thus subject to change\r\nunder the influence of their changing environment and of forces acting\r\nfrom within. How slowly they change may be seen in the apparent\r\nstability of existing species. In the lifetime of the observer and\r\neven in the recorded history of man, species seem as stable as the\r\nmountain and the river. But life forms and land forms are alike\r\nvariable, both in nature and still more under the shaping hand of man.\r\nAs man has modified the face of the earth with his great engineering\r\nworks, so he has produced widely different varieties of many kinds of\r\ndomesticated plants and animals, such as the varieties of the dog and\r\nthe horse, the apple and the rose, which may be regarded in some\r\nrespects as new species in the making. We have assumed that land forms\r\nhave changed in the past under the influence of forces now in\r\noperation. Assuming also that life forms have always changed as they\r\nare changing at present, we come to realize something of the immensity\r\nof geologic time required for the evolution of life from its earliest\r\nlowly forms up to man.\r\n\r\nIt is because the onward march of life has taken the same general\r\ncourse the world over that we are able to use it as a _universal time\r\nscale_ and divide geologic time into ages and minor subdivisions\r\naccording to the ruling or characteristic organisms then living on the\r\nearth. Thus, since vertebrates appeared, we have in succession the Age\r\nof Fishes, the Age of Amphibians, the Age of Reptiles, and the Age of\r\nMammals.\r\n\r\nThe chart given on page 295 is thus based on the law of superposition\r\nand the law of the evolution of organisms. The first law gives the\r\nsuccession of the formations in local areas. The fossils which they\r\ncontain demonstrate the law of the progressive appearance of\r\norganisms, and by means of this law the formations of different\r\ncountries are correlated and set each in its place in a universal time\r\nscale and grouped together according to the affinities of their\r\nimbedded organic remains.\r\n\r\n=Geologic time divisions compared with those of human history.= We may\r\ncompare the division of geologic time into eras, periods, and other\r\ndivisions according to the dominant life of the time, to the\r\nill-defined ages into which human history is divided according to the\r\ndominance of some nation, ruler, or other characteristic feature. Thus\r\nwe speak of the _Dark Ages_, the _Age of Elizabeth_, and the _Age of\r\nElectricity_. These crude divisions would be of much value if, as in\r\nthe case of geologic time, we had no exact reckoning of human history\r\nby years.\r\n\r\nAnd as the course of human history has flowed in an unbroken stream\r\nalong quiet reaches of slow change and through periods of rapid change\r\nand revolution, so with the course of geologic history. Periods of\r\nquiescence, in which revolutionary forces are perhaps gathering head,\r\nalternate with periods of comparatively rapid change in physical\r\ngeography and in organisms, when new and higher forms appear which\r\nserve to draw the boundary line of new epochs. Nevertheless,\r\ngeological history is a continuous progress; its periods and epochs\r\nshade into one another by imperceptible gradations, and all our\r\nsubdivisions must needs be vague and more or less arbitrary.\r\n\r\n=How fossils tell of the geography of the past.= Fossils are used not\r\nonly as a record of the development of life upon the earth, but also\r\nin testimony to the physical geography of past epochs. They indicate\r\nwhether in any region the climate was tropical, temperate, or arctic.\r\nSince species spread slowly from some center of dispersion where they\r\noriginate until some barrier limits their migration farther, the\r\noccurrence of the same species in rocks of the same system in\r\ndifferent countries implies the absence of such barriers at the\r\nperiod. Thus in the collection of antarctic fossils referred to on\r\npage 294 there were shallow-water marine shells identical in species\r\nwith Mesozoic shells found in India and in the southern extremity of\r\nSouth America. Since such organisms are not distributed by the\r\ncurrents of the deep sea and cannot migrate along its bottom, we infer\r\na shallow-water connection in Mesozoic times between India, South\r\nAmerica, and the antarctic region. Such a shallow-water connection\r\nwould be offered along the marginal shelf of a continent uniting these\r\nnow widely separated countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE PRE-CAMBRIAN SYSTEMS\r\n\r\n\r\n=The earth's beginnings.= The geological record does not tell us of\r\nthe beginnings of the earth. The history of the planet, as we have\r\nevery reason to believe, stretches far back beyond the period of the\r\noldest stratified rocks, and is involved in the history of the solar\r\nsystem and of the nebula,--the cloud of glowing gases or of cosmic\r\ndust,--from which the sun and planets are believed to have been\r\nderived.\r\n\r\n=The nebular hypothesis.= It was long held that the earth began as\r\na vaporous, shining sphere, formed by the gathering together of the\r\nmaterial of a gaseous ring which had been detached from a cooling\r\nand shrinking nebula. Such a vaporous sphere would condense to a\r\nliquid fiery globe, whose surface would become cold and solid, while\r\nthe interior would long remain intensely hot because of the slow\r\nconductivity of the crust. Under these conditions the primeval\r\natmosphere of the earth must have contained in vapor the water now\r\nbelonging to the earth's crust and surface. It also held all the oxygen\r\nsince locked up in rocks by their oxidation, and all the carbon dioxide\r\nwhich has since been laid away in limestones, besides that corresponding\r\nto the carbon of carbonaceous deposits, such as peat, coal, and\r\npetroleum. On this hypothesis the original atmosphere was dense, dark,\r\nand noxious, and enormously heavier than the atmosphere at present.\r\n\r\n=The accretion hypothesis.= On the other hand, it has been recently\r\nsuggested that the earth may have grown to its present size by the\r\ngradual accretion of meteoritic masses. Such cold, stony bodies might\r\nhave come together at so slow a rate that the heat caused by their\r\nimpact would not raise sensibly the temperature of the growing planet.\r\nThus the surface of the earth may never have been hot and luminous; but\r\nas the loose aggregation of stony masses grew larger and was more and\r\nmore compressed by its own gravitation, the heat thus generated raised\r\nthe interior to high temperatures, while from time to time molten rock\r\nwas intruded among the loose, cold meteoritic masses of the crust and\r\noutpoured upon the surface.\r\n\r\nSuch a spiral nebula might be formed by the close approach of one star\r\nto another,--of a passing star to our own sun, for example, before the\r\nbirth of the solar system. As the pull of the moon raises the tides on\r\nopposite sides of the earth, so, it is supposed, the pull of the\r\npassing star released the explosive forces of the sun, and two streams\r\nof matter were flung out from it. The knots in the arms formed the\r\nnuclei of the planets. The gaseous matter scattered outside the knots\r\ncooled into small stony masses, revolving about a central mass and\r\nhence called planetesimals (little planets). Like the meteorites which\r\nstill fall upon the earth, the planetesimals were gradually gathered\r\nin by the nuclear knots, which thus grew to the present planets.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that the meteorites of which the earth was built\r\nbrought to it, as meteorites do now, various gases shut up within\r\ntheir pores. As the heat of the interior increased, these gases\r\ntranspired to the surface and formed the primitive atmosphere and\r\nhydrosphere. The atmosphere has therefore grown slowly from the\r\nsmallest beginnings. Gases emitted from the interior in volcanic\r\neruptions and in other ways have ever added to it, and are adding to\r\nit now. On the other hand, the atmosphere has constantly suffered\r\nloss, as it has been robbed of oxygen by the oxidation of rocks in\r\nweathering, and of carbon dioxide in the making of limestones and\r\ncarbonaceous deposits.\r\n\r\nWhile all hypotheses of the earth's beginnings are as yet unproved\r\nspeculations, they serve to bring to mind one of the chief lessons\r\nwhich geology has to teach,--that the duration of the earth in time,\r\nlike the extension of the universe in space, is vastly beyond the\r\npower of the human mind to realize. Behind the history recorded in the\r\nrocks, which stretches back for many million years, lies the long\r\nunrecorded history of the beginnings of the planet; and still farther\r\nin the abysses of the past are dimly seen the cycles of the evolution\r\nof the solar system and of the nebula which gave it birth.\r\n\r\nWe pass now from the dim realm of speculation to the earliest era of\r\nthe recorded history of the earth, where some certain facts may be\r\nobserved and some sure inferences from them may be drawn.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Archean\r\n\r\nThe oldest known sedimentary strata, wherever they are exposed by uplift\r\nand erosion, are found to be involved with a mass of crystalline rocks\r\nwhich possesses the same characteristics in all parts of the world. It\r\nconsists of foliated rocks, gneisses, and schists of various kinds,\r\nwhich have been cut with dikes and other intrusions of molten rock, and\r\nhave been broken, crumpled, and crushed, and left in interlocking masses\r\nso confused that their true arrangement can usually be made out only\r\nwith the greatest difficulty if at all. The condition of this body of\r\ncrystalline rocks is due to the fact that they have suffered not only\r\nfrom the faultings, foldings, and igneous intrusions of their time, but\r\nnecessarily, also, from those of all later geological ages.\r\n\r\nAt present three leading theories are held as to the origin of these\r\nbasal crystalline rocks.\r\n\r\n1. They are considered by perhaps the majority of the geologists who\r\nhave studied them most carefully to be igneous rocks intruded in a\r\nmolten state among the sedimentary rocks involved with them. In many\r\nlocalities this relation is proved by the phenomena of contact (p. 268);\r\nbut for the most part the deformations which the rocks have since\r\nsuffered again and again have been sufficient to destroy such evidence\r\nif it ever existed.\r\n\r\n2. An older view regards them as profoundly altered sedimentary strata,\r\nthe most ancient of the earth.\r\n\r\n3. According to a third theory they represent portions of the earth's\r\noriginal crust; not, indeed, its original surface, but deeper portions\r\nuncovered by erosion and afterwards mantled with sedimentary deposits.\r\nAll these theories agree that the present foliated condition of these\r\nrocks is due to the intense metamorphism which they have suffered.\r\n\r\nIt is to this body of crystalline rocks and the stratified rocks\r\ninvolved with it, which form a very small proportion of its mass,\r\nthat the term _Archean_ (Greek, arche, beginning) is applied by\r\nmany geologists.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Algonkian\r\n\r\nIn some regions there rests unconformably on the Archean an immense\r\nbody of stratified rocks, thousands and in places even scores\r\nof thousands of feet thick, known as the _Algonkian_. Great\r\nunconformities divide it into well-defined systems, but as only\r\nthe scantiest traces of fossils appear here and there among its strata,\r\nit is as yet impossible to correlate the formations of different\r\nregions and to give them names of more than local application. We\r\nwill describe the Algonkian rocks of two typical areas.\r\n\r\n=The Grand Canyon of the Colorado.= We have already studied a very\r\nancient peneplain whose edge is exposed to view deep on the walls of\r\nthe Colorado Canyon (_nu´_, Fig. 207). The formation of flat-lying\r\nsandstone which covers this buried land surface is proved by its\r\nfossils to belong to the Cambrian,--the earliest period of the\r\nPaleozoic era. The tilted rocks (_b_, Fig. 207). on whose upturned\r\nedges the Cambrian sandstone rests are far older, for the physical\r\nbreak which separates them from it records a time interval during\r\nwhich they were upheaved to mountainous ridges and worn down to a low\r\nplain. They are therefore classified as Algonkian. They comprise two\r\nimmense series. The upper is more than five thousand feet thick and\r\nconsists of shales and sandstones with some limestones. Separated from\r\nit by an unconformity which does not appear in Figure 207, the lower\r\ndivision, seven thousand feet thick, consists chiefly of massive\r\nreddish sandstones with seven or more sheets of lava interbedded. The\r\nlowest member is a basal conglomerate composed of pebbles derived from\r\nthe erosion of the dark crumpled schists beneath,--schists which are\r\nsupposed to be Archean. As shown in Figure 207, a strong unconformity\r\n(_nm´_, Fig. 207) parts the schists and the Algonkian. The floor on\r\nwhich the Algonkian rests is remarkably even, and here again is proved\r\nan interval of incalculable length, during which an ancient land mass\r\nof Archean rocks was baseleveled before it received the cover of the\r\nsediments of the later age.\r\n\r\n=The Lake Superior region.= In eastern Canada an area of pre-Cambrian\r\nrocks, Archean and Algonkian, estimated at two million square miles,\r\nstretches from the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River northward to\r\nthe confines of the continent, inclosing Hudson Bay in the arms of a\r\ngigantic U. This immense area, which we have already studied as the\r\nLaurentian peneplain (p. 89), extends southward across the Canadian\r\nborder into northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. The rocks of\r\nthis area are known to be pre-Cambrian; for the Cambrian strata,\r\nwherever found, lie unconformably upon them.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 262. Ideal Section in the Lake Superior\r\n      Region]\r\n\r\nThe general relations of the formations of that portion of the area\r\nwhich lies about Lake Superior are shown in Figure 262. Great\r\nunconformities, _UU´_ separate the Algonkian both from the Archean and\r\nfrom the Cambrian, and divide it into three distinct systems,--the\r\n_Lower Huronian_, the _Upper Huronian_, and the _Keweenawan_. The\r\nLower and the Upper Huronian consist in the main of old sea muds and\r\nsands and limy oozes now changed to gneisses, schists, marbles,\r\nquartzites, slates, and other metamorphic rocks. The Keweenawan is\r\ncomposed of immense piles of lava, such as those of Iceland, overlain\r\nby bedded sandstones. What remains of these rock systems after the\r\ndenudation of all later geologic ages is enormous. The Lower Huronian\r\nis more than a mile thick, the Upper Huronian more than two miles\r\nthick, while the Keweenawan exceeds nine miles in thickness. The vast\r\nlength of Algonkian time is shown by the thickness of its marine\r\ndeposits and by the cycles of erosion which it includes. In Figure 262\r\nthe student may read an outline of the history of the Lake Superior\r\nregion, the deformations which it suffered, their relative severity,\r\nthe times when they occurred, and the erosion cycles marked by the\r\nsuccessive unconformities.\r\n\r\n=Other pre-Cambrian areas in North America.= Pre-Cambrian rocks are\r\nexposed in various parts of the continent, usually by the erosion of\r\nmountain ranges in which their strata were infolded. Large areas occur\r\nin the maritime provinces of Canada. The core of the Green Mountains\r\nof Vermont is pre-Cambrian, and rocks of these systems occur in\r\nscattered patches in western Massachusetts. Here belong also the\r\noldest rocks of the Highlands of the Hudson and of New Jersey. The\r\nAdirondack region, an outlier of the Laurentian region, exposes\r\npre-Cambrian rocks, which have been metamorphosed and tilted by the\r\nintrusion of a great boss of igneous rock out of which the central\r\npeaks are carved. The core of the Blue Ridge and probably much of the\r\nPiedmont Belt are of this age. In the Black Hills the irruption of an\r\nimmense mass of granite has caused or accompanied the upheaval of\r\npre-Cambrian strata and metamorphosed them by heat and pressure into\r\ngneisses, schists, quartzites, and slates. In most of these\r\nmountainous regions the lowest strata are profoundly changed by\r\nmetamorphism, and they can be assigned to the pre-Cambrian only where\r\nthey are clearly overlain unconformably by formations proved to be\r\nCambrian by their fossils. In the Belt Mountains of Montana, however,\r\nthe Cambrian is underlain by Algonkian sediments twelve thousand feet\r\nthick, and but little altered.\r\n\r\n=Mineral wealth of the pre-Cambrian rocks.= The pre-Cambrian rocks are\r\nof very great economic importance, because of their extensive\r\nmetamorphism and the enormous masses of igneous rock which they\r\ninvolve. In many parts of the country they are the source of supply of\r\ngranite, gneiss, marble, slate, and other such building materials.\r\nStill more valuable are the stores of iron and copper and other metals\r\nwhich they contain.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the pre-Cambrian region about Lake Superior leads\r\nthe world in the production of iron ore, its output for 1903 being\r\nmore than five sevenths of the entire output of the whole United\r\nStates, and exceeding that of any foreign country. The ore bodies\r\nconsist chiefly of the red oxide of iron (hematite) and occur in\r\ntroughs of the strata, underlain by some impervious rock. A theory\r\nheld by many refers the ultimate source of the iron to the igneous\r\nrocks of the Archean. When these rocks were upheaved and subjected to\r\nweathering, their iron compounds were decomposed. Their iron was\r\nleached out and carried away to be laid in the Algonkian water bodies\r\nin beds of iron carbonate and other iron compounds. During the later\r\nages, after the Algonkian strata had been uplifted to form part of the\r\ncontinent, a second concentration has taken place. Descending\r\nunderground waters charged with oxygen have decomposed the iron\r\ncarbonate and deposited the iron, in the form of iron oxide, in\r\ntroughs of the strata where their downward progress was arrested by\r\nimpervious floors.\r\n\r\nThe pre-Cambrian rocks of the eastern United States also are rich in\r\niron. In certain districts, as in the Highlands of New Jersey, the\r\nblack oxide of iron (magnetite) is so abundant in beds and\r\ndisseminated grains that the ordinary surveyor's compass is useless.\r\n\r\nThe pre-Cambrian copper mines of the Lake Superior region are among\r\nthe richest on the globe. In the igneous rocks copper, next to iron,\r\nis the most common of all the useful metals, and it was especially\r\nabundant in the Keweenawan lavas. After the Keweenawan was uplifted to\r\nform land, percolating waters leached out much of the copper diffused\r\nin the lava sheets and deposited it within steam blebs as amygdules of\r\nnative copper, in cracks and fissures, and especially as a cement, or\r\nmatrix, in the interbedded gravels which formed the chief aquifers of\r\nthe region. The famous Calumet and Hecla mine follows down the dip of\r\nthe strata to the depth of nearly a mile and works such an ancient\r\nconglomerate whose matrix is pure copper.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 263. Successive Stages in the Development\r\n      of the Ovum to the Gastrula Stage]\r\n\r\n=The appearance of life.= Sometime during the dim ages preceding the\r\nCambrian, whether in the Archean or in the Algonkian we know not,\r\noccurred one of the most important events in the history of the earth.\r\nLife appeared for the first time upon the planet. Geology has no\r\nevidence whatever to offer as to whence or how life came. All\r\nanalogies lead us to believe that its appearance must have been\r\nsudden. Its earliest forms are unknown, but analogy suggests that as\r\nevery living creature has developed from a single cell, so the\r\nearliest organisms upon the globe--the germs from which all later life\r\nis supposed to have been evolved--were tiny, unicellular masses of\r\nprotoplasm, resembling the amoeba of to-day in the simplicity of their\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nSuch lowly forms were destitute of any hard parts and could leave no\r\nevidence of their existence in the record of the rocks. And of their\r\nsupposed descendants we find so few traces in the pre-Cambrian strata\r\nthat the first steps in organic evolution must be supplied from such\r\nanalogies in embryology as the following. The fertilized ovum, the\r\ncell with which each animal begins its life, grows and multiplies by\r\ncell division, and develops into a hollow globe of cells called the\r\n_blastosphere_. This stage is succeeded by the stage of the\r\n_gastrula_,--an ovoid or cup-shaped body with a double wall of cells\r\ninclosing a body cavity, and with an opening, the primitive mouth.\r\nEach of these early embryological stages is represented by living\r\nanimals,--the undivided cell by the _protozoa_, the blastosphere by\r\nsome rare forms, and the gastrula in the essential structure of the\r\n_coelenterates_,--the subkingdom to which the fresh-water hydra and\r\nthe corals belong. All forms of animal life, from the coelenterates to\r\nthe mammals, follow the same path in their embryological development\r\nas far as the gastrula stage, but here their paths widely diverge,\r\nthose of each subkingdom going their own separate ways.\r\n\r\nWe may infer, therefore, that during the pre-Cambrian periods organic\r\nevolution followed the lines thus dimly traced. The earliest\r\none-celled protozoa were probably succeeded by many-celled animals of\r\nthe type of the blastosphere, and these by gastrula-like organisms.\r\nFrom the gastrula type the higher subdivisions of animal life\r\nprobably diverged, as separate branches from a common trunk. Much or\r\nall of this vast differentiation was accomplished before the opening\r\nof the next era; for all the subkingdoms are represented in the\r\nCambrian except the vertebrates.\r\n\r\n=Evidences of pre-Cambrian life.= An indirect evidence of life during\r\nthe pre-Cambrian periods is found in the abundant and varied fauna of\r\nthe next period; for, if the theory of evolution is correct, the\r\ndifferentiation of the Cambrian fauna was a long process which might\r\nwell have required for its accomplishment a large part of pre-Cambrian\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nOther indirect evidences are the pre-Cambrian limestones, iron ores,\r\nand graphite deposits, since such minerals and rocks have been formed\r\nin later times by the help of organisms. If the carbonate of lime of\r\nthe Algonkian limestones and marbles was extracted from sea water by\r\norganisms, as is done at present by corals, mollusks, and other humble\r\nanimals and plants, the life of those ancient seas must have been\r\nabundant. Graphite, a soft black mineral composed of carbon and used\r\nin the manufacture of lead pencils and as a lubricant, occurs widely\r\nin the metamorphic pre-Cambrian rocks. It is known to be produced in\r\nsome cases by the metamorphism of coal, which itself is formed of\r\ndecomposed vegetal tissues. Seams of graphite may therefore represent\r\naccumulations of vegetal matter such as seaweed. But limestone, iron\r\nores, and graphite can be produced by chemical processes, and their\r\npresence in the pre-Cambrian makes it only probable, and not certain,\r\nthat life existed at that time.\r\n\r\n=Pre-Cambrian fossils.= Very rarely has any clear trace of an organism\r\nbeen found in the most ancient chapters of the geological record, so\r\nmany of their leaves have been destroyed and so far have their pages\r\nbeen defaced. Omitting structures whose organic nature has been\r\nquestioned, there are left to mention a tiny seashell of one of the\r\nmost lowly types,--a _Discina_ from the pre-Cambrian rocks of the\r\nColorado Canyon,--and from the pre-Cambrian rocks of Montana trails of\r\nannelid worms and casts of their burrows in ancient beaches, and\r\nfragments of the tests of crustaceans. These diverse forms indicate\r\nthat before the Algonkian had closed, life was abundant and had widely\r\ndifferentiated. We may expect that other forms will be discovered as\r\nthe rocks are closely searched.\r\n\r\n=Pre-Cambrian geography.= Our knowledge is far too meager to warrant\r\nan attempt to draw the varying outlines of sea and land during the\r\nArchean and Algonkian eras. Pre-Cambrian time probably was longer than\r\nall later geological time down to the present, as we may infer from\r\nthe vast thicknesses of its rocks and the unconformities which part\r\nthem. We know that during its long periods land masses again and again\r\nrose from the sea, were worn low, and were submerged and covered with\r\nthe waste of other lands. But the formations of separated regions\r\ncannot be correlated because of the absence of fossils, and nothing\r\nmore can be made out than the detached chapters of local histories,\r\nsuch as the outline given of the district about Lake Superior.\r\n\r\nThe pre-Cambrian rocks show no evidence of any forces then at work\r\nupon the earth except the forces which are at work upon it now. The\r\nmost ancient sediments known are so like the sediments now being laid\r\nthat we may infer that they were formed under conditions essentially\r\nsimilar to those of the present time. There is no proof that the sands\r\nof the pre-Cambrian sandstones were swept by any more powerful waves\r\nand currents than are offshore sands to-day, or that the muds of the\r\npre-Cambrian shales settled to the sea floor in less quiet water than\r\nsuch muds settle in at present. The pre-Cambrian lands were, no doubt,\r\nworn by wind and weather, beaten by rain, and furrowed by streams as\r\nnow, and, as now, they fronted the ocean with beaches on which waves\r\ndashed and along which tidal currents ran.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the chief difference between the pre-Cambrian and the present\r\nwas the absence of life upon the land. So far as we have any\r\nknowledge, no forests covered the mountain sides, no verdure carpeted\r\nthe plains, and no animals lived on the ground or in the air. It is\r\npermitted to think of the most ancient lands as deserts of barren rock\r\nand rock waste swept by rains and trenched by powerful streams. We may\r\ntherefore suppose that the processes of their destruction went on more\r\nrapidly than at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE CAMBRIAN\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Paleozoic era.= The second volume of the geological record,\r\ncalled the Paleozoic (Greek, _palaios_, ancient; _zoe_, life), has\r\ncome down to us far less mutilated and defaced than has the first\r\nvolume, which contains the traces of the most ancient life of the\r\nglobe. Fossils are far more abundant in the Paleozoic than in the\r\nearlier strata, while the sediments in which they were entombed have\r\nsuffered far less from metamorphism and other causes, and have been\r\nless widely buried from view, than the strata of the pre-Cambrian\r\ngroups. By means of their fossils we can correlate the formations of\r\nwidely separated regions from the beginning of the Paleozoic on, and\r\ncan therefore trace some outline of the history of the continents.\r\n\r\nPaleozoic time, although shorter than the pre-Cambrian as measured by\r\nthe thickness of the strata, must still be reckoned in millions of\r\nyears. During this vast reach of time the changes in organisms were\r\nvery great. It is according to the successive stages in the advance of\r\nlife that the Paleozoic formations are arranged in five systems,--the\r\n_Cambrian_, the _Ordovician_, the _Silurian_, the _Devonian_, and the\r\n_Carboniferous_. On the same basis the first three systems are grouped\r\ntogether as the older Paleozoic, because they alike are characterized\r\nby the dominance of the invertebrates; while the last two systems are\r\nunited in the later Paleozoic, and are characterized, the one by the\r\ndominance of fishes, and the other by the appearance of amphibians and\r\nreptiles.\r\n\r\nEach of these systems is world-wide in its distribution, and may be\r\nrecognized on any continent by its own peculiar fauna. The names first\r\ngiven them in Great Britain have therefore come into general use,\r\nwhile their subdivisions, which often cannot be correlated in\r\ndifferent countries and different regions, are usually given local\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nThe first three systems were named from the fact that their strata are\r\nwell displayed in Wales. The Cambrian carries the Roman name of Wales,\r\nand the Ordovician and Silurian the names of tribes of ancient Britons\r\nwhich inhabited the same country. The Devonian is named from the\r\nEnglish county Devon, where its rocks were early studied. The\r\nCarboniferous was so called from the large amount of coal which it was\r\nfound to contain in Great Britain and continental Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cambrian\r\n\r\n=Distribution of strata.= The Cambrian rocks outcrop in narrow belts\r\nabout the pre-Cambrian areas of eastern Canada and the Lake Superior\r\nregion, the Adirondacks and the Green Mountains. Strips of Cambrian\r\nformations occupy troughs in the pre-Cambrian rocks of New England and\r\nthe maritime provinces of Canada; a long belt borders on the west the\r\ncrystalline rocks of the Blue Ridge; and on the opposite side of the\r\ncontinent the Cambrian reappears in the mountains of the Great Basin\r\nand the Canadian Rockies. In the Mississippi valley it is exposed in\r\nsmall districts where uplift has permitted the stripping off of\r\nyounger rocks. Although the areas of outcrop are small, we may infer\r\nthat Cambrian rocks were widely deposited over the continent of North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n=Physical geography.= The Cambrian system of North America comprises\r\nthree distinct series, the _Lower Cambrian_, the _Middle Cambrian_,\r\nand the _Upper Cambrian_, each of which is characterized by its own\r\npeculiar fauna. In sketching the outlines of the continent as it was\r\nat the beginning of the Paleozoic, it must be remembered that wherever\r\nthe Lower Cambrian formations now are found was certainly then sea\r\nbottom, and wherever the Lower Cambrian are wanting, and the next\r\nformations rest directly on pre-Cambrian rocks, was probably then\r\nland.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 264. Hypothetical Map of Eastern North\r\n     America at the Beginning of Cambrian Time\r\n\r\n   Unshaded areas, probable land]\r\n\r\n=Early Cambrian geography.= In this way we know that at the opening of\r\nthe Cambrian two long, narrow mediterranean seas stretched from north\r\nto south across the continent. The eastern sea extended from the Gulf\r\nof St. Lawrence down the Champlain-Hudson valley and thence along the\r\nwestern base of the Blue Ridge south at least to Alabama. The western\r\nsea stretched from the Canadian Rockies over the Great Basin and at\r\nleast as far south as the Grand Canyon of the Colorado in Arizona.\r\n\r\nBetween these mediterraneans lay a great central land which included\r\nthe pre-Cambrian U-shaped area of the Laurentian peneplain, and\r\nprobably extended southward to the latitude of New Orleans. To the\r\neast lay a land which we may designate as _Appalachia_, whose western\r\nshore line was drawn along the site of the present Blue Ridge, but\r\nwhose other limits are quite unknown. The land of Appalachia must have\r\nbeen large, for it furnished a great amount of waste during the entire\r\nPaleozoic era, and its eastern coast may possibly have lain even\r\nbeyond the edge of the present continental shelf. On the western side\r\nof the continent a narrow land occupied the site of the Sierra Nevada\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nThus, even at the beginning of the Paleozoic, the continental plateau\r\nof North America had already been left by crustal movements in relief\r\nabove the abysses of the great oceans on either side. The\r\nmediterraneans which lay upon it were shallow, as their sediments\r\nprove. They were _epicontinental seas_; that is, they rested _upon_\r\n(Greek, _epi_) the submerged portion of the continental plateau. We\r\nhave no proof that the deep ocean ever occupied any part of where\r\nNorth America now is.\r\n\r\nThe Middle and Upper Cambrian strata are found together with the Lower\r\nCambrian over the area of both the eastern and the western\r\nmediterraneans, so that here the sea continued during the entire\r\nperiod. The sediments throughout are those of shoal water. Coarse\r\ncross-bedded sandstones record the action of strong shifting currents\r\nwhich spread coarse waste near shore and winnowed it of finer stuff.\r\nFrequent ripple marks on the bedding planes of the strata prove that\r\nthe loose sands of the sea floor were near enough to the surface to be\r\nagitated by waves and tidal currents. Sun cracks show that often the\r\noutgoing tide exposed large muddy flats to the drying action of the\r\nsun. The fossils, also, of the strata are of kinds related to those\r\nwhich now live in shallow waters near the shore.\r\n\r\nThe sediments which gathered in the mediterranean seas were very\r\nthick, reaching in places the enormous depth of ten thousand feet.\r\nHence the bottoms of these seas were sinking troughs, ever filling\r\nwith waste from the adjacent land as fast as they subsided.\r\n\r\n=Late Cambrian geography.= The formations of the Middle and Upper\r\nCambrian are found resting unconformably on the pre-Cambrian rocks\r\nfrom New York westward into Minnesota and at various points in the\r\ninterior, as in Missouri and in Texas. Hence after earlier Cambrian\r\ntime the central land subsided, with much the same effect as if the\r\nMississippi valley were now to lower gradually, and the Gulf of Mexico\r\nto spread northward until it entered Lake Superior. The Cambrian seas\r\ntransgressed the central land and strewed far and wide behind their\r\nadvancing beaches the sediments of the later Cambrian upon an eroded\r\nsurface of pre-Cambrian rocks.\r\n\r\nThe succession of the Cambrian formations in North America records\r\nmany minor oscillations and varying conditions of physical geography;\r\nyet on the whole it tells of widening seas and lowering lands. Basal\r\nconglomerates and coarse sandstones which must have been laid near\r\nshore are succeeded by shaly sandstones, sandy shales, and shales.\r\nToward the top of the series heavy beds of limestone, extending from\r\nthe Blue Ridge to Missouri, speak of clear water, and either of more\r\ndistant shores or of neighboring lands which were worn or sunk so low\r\nthat for the most part their waste was carried to the sea in solution.\r\n\r\nIn brief, the Cambrian was a period of submergence. It began with the\r\nlarger part of North America emerged as great land masses. It closed\r\nwith most of the interior of the continental plateau covered with a\r\nshallow sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Life of the Cambrian Period\r\n\r\nIt is now for the first time that we find preserved in the offshore\r\ndeposits of the Cambrian seas enough remains of animal life to be\r\nproperly called a fauna. Doubtless these remains are only the most\r\nfragmentary representation of the life of the time, for the Cambrian\r\nrocks are very old and have been widely metamorphosed. Yet the five\r\nhundred and more species already discovered embrace all the leading\r\ntypes of invertebrate life, and are so varied that we must believe\r\nthat their lines of descent stretch far back into the pre-Cambrian\r\npast.\r\n\r\n=Plants.= No remains of plants have been found in Cambrian strata,\r\nexcept some doubtful markings, as of seaweed.\r\n\r\n=Sponges.= The sponges, the lowest of the multicellular animals, were\r\nrepresented by several orders. Their fossils are recognized by the\r\nsiliceous spicules, which, as in modern sponges, either were scattered\r\nthrough a mass of horny fibers or were connected in a flinty\r\nframework.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 265. Sponge Spicules as seen in Flint under\r\n      the Microscope]\r\n\r\n=Coelenterates.= This subkingdom includes two classes of interest to\r\nthe geologist,--the _Hydrozoa_, such as the fresh-water hydra and the\r\njellyfish, and the _corals_. Both classes existed in the Cambrian.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 266. Graptolites]\r\n\r\nThe Hydrozoa were represented not only by jellyfish but also by the\r\n_graptolite_, which takes its name from a fancied resemblance of some\r\nof its forms to a quill pen. It was a composite animal with a horny\r\nframework, the individuals of the colony living in cells strung on one\r\nor both sides along a hollow stem, and communicating by means of a\r\ncommon flesh in this central tube. Some graptolites were straight, and\r\nsome curved or spiral; some were single stemmed, and others consisted\r\nof several radial stems united. Graptolites occur but rarely in the\r\nUpper Cambrian. In the Ordovician and Silurian they are very\r\nplentiful, and at the close of the Silurian they pass out of\r\nexistence, never to return.\r\n\r\n=Corals= are very rarely found in the Cambrian, and the description of\r\ntheir primitive types is postponed to later chapters treating of\r\nperiods when they became more numerous.\r\n\r\n=Echinoderms.= This subkingdom comprises at present such familiar\r\nforms as the crinoid, the starfish, and the sea urchin. The structure\r\nof echinoderms is radiate. Their integument is hardened with plates or\r\nparticles of carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 267. Cystoids, one showing Two Rudimentary\r\n      Arms]\r\n\r\nOf the free echinoderms, such as the starfish and the sea urchin, the\r\nformer has been found in the Cambrian rocks of Europe, but neither\r\nhave so far been discovered in the strata of this period in North\r\nAmerica. The stemmed and lower division of the echinoderms was\r\nrepresented by a primitive type, the _cystoid_, so called from its\r\nsaclike form, A small globular or ovate \"calyx\" of calcareous plates,\r\nwith an aperture at the top for the mouth, inclosed the body of the\r\nanimal, and was attached to the sea bottom by a short flexible stalk\r\nconsisting of disks of carbonate of lime held together by a central\r\nligament.\r\n\r\n=Arthropods.= These segmented animals with \"jointed feet,\" as their\r\nname suggests, may be divided in a general way into water breathers\r\nand air breathers. The first-named and lower division comprises the\r\nclass of the _Crustacea_,--arthropods protected by a hard exterior\r\nskeleton, or \"crust,\"--of which crabs, crayfish, and lobsters are\r\nfamiliar examples. The higher division, that of the air breathers,\r\nincludes the following classes: spiders, scorpions, centipedes, and\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\n=The trilobite.= The aquatic arthropods, the Crustacea, culminated\r\nbefore the air breathers; and while none of the latter are found in\r\nthe Cambrian, the former were the dominant life of the time in\r\nnumbers, in size, and in the variety of their forms. The leading\r\ncrustacean type is the _trilobite_, which takes its name from the\r\nthree lobes into which its shell is divided longitudinally. There are\r\nalso three cross divisions,--the head shield, the tail shield, and\r\nbetween the two the thorax, consisting of a number of distinct and\r\nunconsolidated segments. The head shield carries a pair of large,\r\ncrescentic, compound eyes, like those of the insect. The eye varies\r\ngreatly in the number of its lenses, ranging from fourteen in some\r\nspecies to fifteen thousand in others. Figure 268, C, is a restoration\r\nof the trilobite, and shows the appendages, which are found preserved\r\nonly in the rarest cases.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 268. Trilobites\r\n\r\n   A, a Cambrian species; B, a Devonian species showing eyes;\r\n   C, restoration of an Ordovician species]\r\n\r\nDuring the long ages of the Cambrian the trilobite varied greatly.\r\nAgain and again new species and genera appeared, while the older types\r\nbecame extinct. For this reason and because of their abundance,\r\ntrilobites are used in the classification of the Cambrian system. The\r\nLower Cambrian is characterized by the presence of a trilobitic fauna\r\nin which the genus Olenellus is predominant. This, the _Olenellus\r\nZone_, is one of the most important platforms in the entire geological\r\nseries; for, the world over, it marks the beginning of Paleozoic time,\r\nwhile all underlying strata are classified as pre-Cambrian. The Middle\r\nCambrian is marked by the genus Paradoxides, and the Upper Cambrian by\r\nthe genus Olenus. Some of the Cambrian trilobites were giants,\r\nmeasuring as much as two feet long, while others were the smallest of\r\ntheir kind, a fraction of an inch in length.\r\n\r\nAnother type of crustacean which lived in the Cambrian and whose order\r\nis still living is illustrated in Figure 269.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 269. A Phyllopod]\r\n\r\n=Worms.= Trails and burrows of worms have been left on the sea beaches\r\nand mud flats of all geological times from the Algonkian to the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n=Brachiopods.= These soft-bodied animals, with bivalve shells and two\r\ninterior armlike processes which served for breathing, appeared in the\r\nAlgonkian, and had now become very abundant. The two valves of the\r\nbrachiopod shell are unequal in size, and in each valve a line drawn\r\nfrom the beak to the base divides the valve into two equal parts\r\n(Fig. 270). It may thus be told from the pelecypod mollusk, such as the\r\nclam, whose two valves are not far from equal in size, each being\r\ndivided into unequal parts by a line dropped from the beak (Fig.272).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 270. A Cambrian Articulate Brachiopod, Orthis]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 271. Cambrian Inarticulate Brachiopods\r\n\r\n   A, Lingulella; B, Discina]\r\n\r\nBrachiopods include two orders. In the most primitive order--that of\r\nthe _inarticulate_ brachiopods--the two valves are held together only\r\nby muscles of the animal, and the shell is horny or is composed of\r\nphosphate of lime. The _Discina_, which began in the Algonkian, is of\r\nthis type, as is also the _Lingulella_ of the Cambrian (Fig. 271). Both\r\nof these genera have lived on during the millions of years of geological\r\ntime since their introduction, handing down from generation to\r\ngeneration with hardly any change to their descendants now living off\r\nour shores the characters impressed upon them at the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe more highly organized _articulate_ brachiopods have valves of\r\ncarbonate of lime more securely joined by a hinge with teeth and\r\nsockets (Fig. 270). In the Cambrian the inarticulates predominate,\r\nthough the articulates grow common toward the end of the period.\r\n\r\n=Mollusks.= The three chief classes of mollusks--the _pelecypods_\r\n(represented by the oyster and clam of to-day), the _gastropods_\r\n(represented now by snails, conches, and periwinkles), and the\r\n_cephalopods_ (such as the nautilus, cuttlefish, and squids)--were all\r\nrepresented in the Cambrian, although very sparingly.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 272. A Cambrian Pelecypod]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 273. Gastropods]\r\n\r\nPteropods, a suborder of the gastropods, appeared in this age. Their\r\npapery shells of carbonate of lime are found in great numbers from\r\nthis time on.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 274. Cambrian Pteropods]\r\n\r\nCephalopods, the most highly organized of the mollusks, started into\r\nexistence, so far as the record shows, toward, the end of the Cambrian,\r\nwith the long extinct _Orthoceras_ (_straighthorn_) and the allied\r\ngenera of its family. The Orthoceras had a long, straight, and tapering\r\nshell, divided by cross partitions into chambers. The animal lived in\r\nthe \"body chamber\" at the larger end, and walled off the other chambers\r\nfrom it in succession during the growth of the shell. A central tube,\r\nthe _siphuncle_ (_s_, Fig. 275, _B_), passed through from the body\r\nchamber to the closed tip of the cone.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 275. Orthoceras\r\n\r\n   A, fossil; B, restoration]\r\n\r\nThe seashells, both brachiopods and mollusks, are in some respects the\r\nmost important to the geologist of all fossils. They have been so\r\nnumerous, so widely distributed, and so well preserved because of\r\ntheir durable shells and their station in growing sediments, that\r\nbetter than any other group of organisms they can be used to correlate\r\nthe strata of different regions and to mark by their slow changes the\r\nadvance of geological time.\r\n\r\n=Climate.= The life of Cambrian times in different countries contains\r\nno suggestion of any marked climatic zones, and as in later periods a\r\nwarm climate probably reached to the polar regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE ORDOVICIAN[2] AND SILURIAN\r\n\r\n[2] Often known as the Lower Silurian.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ordovician\r\n\r\nIn North America the Ordovician rocks lie conformably on the Cambrian.\r\nThe two periods, therefore, were not parted by any deformation, either\r\nof mountain making or of continental uplift. The general submergence\r\nwhich marked the Cambrian continued into the succeeding period with\r\nlittle interruption.\r\n\r\n=Subdivisions and distribution of strata.= The Ordovician series, as\r\nthey have been made out in New York, are given for reference in the\r\nfollowing table, with the rocks of which they are chiefly composed:\r\n\r\n  5 Hudson       .....  shales\r\n  4 Utica        .....  shales\r\n  3 Trenton      .....  limestones\r\n  2 Chazy        .....  limestones\r\n  1 Calciferous  .....  sandy limestones\r\n\r\nThese marine formations of the Ordovician outcrop about the Cambrian\r\nand pre-Cambrian areas, and, as borings show, extend far and wide over\r\nthe interior of the continent beneath more recent strata. The\r\nOrdovician sea stretched from Appalachia across the Mississippi\r\nvalley. It seems to have extended to California, although broken\r\nprobably by several mountainous islands in the west.\r\n\r\n=Physical geography.= The physical history of the period is recorded\r\nin the succession of its formations. The sandstones of the Upper\r\nCambrian, as we have learned, tell of a transgressing sea which\r\ngradually came to occupy the Mississippi valley and the interior of\r\nNorth America. The limestones of the early and middle Ordovician show\r\nthat now the shore had become remote and the lands had become more\r\nlow. The waters now had cleared. Colonies of brachiopods and other\r\nlime-secreting animals occupied the sea bottom, and their debris\r\nmantled it with sheets of limy ooze. The sandy limestones of the\r\nCalciferous record the transition stage from the Cambrian when some\r\nsand was still brought in from shore. The highly fossiliferous\r\nlimestones of the Trenton tell of clear water and abundant life. We\r\nneed not regard this epicontinental sea as deep. No abysmal deposits\r\nhave been found, and the limestones of the period are those which\r\nwould be laid in clear, warm water of moderate depth like that of\r\nmodern coral seas.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 276. Hypothetical Map of the Eastern United\r\n      States in Ordovician Time\r\n\r\n   Shaded areas, probable sea; broken lines, approximate shore lines]\r\n\r\nThe shales of the Utica and Hudson show that the waters of the sea now\r\nbecame clouded with mud washed in from land. Either the land was\r\ngradually uplifted, or perhaps there had arrived one of those periodic\r\ncrises which, as we may imagine, have taken place whenever the\r\ncrust of the shrinking earth has slowly given way over its great\r\ndepressions, and the ocean has withdrawn its waters into deepening\r\nabysses. The land was thus left relatively higher and bordered with\r\nnew coastal plains. The epicontinental sea was shoaled and narrowed,\r\nand muds were washed in from the adjacent lands.\r\n\r\n=The Taconic deformation.= The Ordovician was closed by a deformation\r\nwhose extent and severity are not yet known. From the St. Lawrence\r\nRiver to New York Bay, along the northwestern and western border of\r\nNew England, lies a belt of Cambrian-Ordovician rocks more than a mile\r\nin total thickness, which accumulated during the long ages of those\r\nperiods in a gradually subsiding trough between the Adirondacks and a\r\npre-Cambrian range lying west of the Connecticut River. But since\r\ntheir deposition these ancient sediments have been crumpled and\r\ncrushed, broken with great faults, and extensively metamorphosed. The\r\nlimestones have recrystallized into marbles, among them the famous\r\nmarbles of Vermont; the Cambrian sandstones have become quartzites,\r\nand the Hudson shale has been changed to a schist exposed on Manhattan\r\nIsland and northward.\r\n\r\nIn part these changes occurred at the close of the Ordovician, for in\r\nseveral places beds of Silurian age rest unconformably on the upturned\r\nOrdovician strata; but recent investigations have made it probable\r\nthat the crustal movements recurred at later times, and it was perhaps\r\nin the Devonian and at the close of the Carboniferous that the greater\r\npart of the deformation and metamorphism was accomplished. As a result\r\nof these movements,--perhaps several times repeated,--a great mountain\r\nrange was upridged, which has been long since leveled by erosion, but\r\nwhose roots are now visible in the Taconic Mountains of western New\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n=The Cincinnati anticline.= Over an oval area in Ohio, Indiana, and\r\nKentucky, whose longer axis extends from north to south through\r\nCincinnati, the Ordovician strata rise in a very low, broad swell,\r\ncalled the Cincinnati anticline. The Silurian and Devonian strata thin\r\nout as they approach this area and seem never to have deposited upon\r\nit. We may regard it, therefore, as an island upwarped from the sea at\r\nthe close of the Ordovician or shortly after.\r\n\r\n=Petroleum and natural gas.= These valuable illuminants and fuels are\r\nconsidered here because, although they are found in traces in older\r\nstrata, it is in the Ordovician that they occur for the first time in\r\nlarge quantities. They range throughout later formations down to the\r\nmost recent.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 277. Diagram Illustrating the Conditions of\r\n      Accumulation of Oil and Gas\r\n\r\n   _a_, source; _b_, reservoir; _c_, cover. What would be the result\r\n   of boring to the reservoir rock at _d_? at _d´_? at _d´´_?]\r\n\r\nThe oil horizons of California and Texas are Tertiary; those of\r\nColorado, Cretaceous; those of West Virginia, Carboniferous; those of\r\nPennsylvania, Kentucky, and Canada, Devonian; and the large field of\r\nOhio and Indiana belongs to the Ordovician and higher systems.\r\n\r\nPetroleum and natural gas, wherever found, have probably originated\r\nfrom the decay of organic matter when buried in sedimentary deposits,\r\njust as at present in swampy places the hydrogen and carbon of\r\ndecaying vegetation combine to form marsh gas. The light and heat of\r\nthese hydrocarbons we may think of, therefore, as a gift to the\r\ncivilized life of our race from the humble organisms, both animal and\r\nvegetable, of the remote past, whose remains were entombed in the\r\nsediments of the Ordovician and later geological ages.\r\n\r\nPetroleum is very widely disseminated throughout the stratified rocks.\r\nCertain limestones are visibly greasy with it, and others give off its\r\ncharacteristic fetid odor when struck with a hammer. Many shales are\r\nbituminous, and some are so highly charged that small flakes may be\r\nlighted like tapers, and several gallons of oil to the ton may be\r\nobtained by distillation.\r\n\r\nBut oil and gas are found in paying quantities only when certain\r\nconditions meet:\r\n\r\n1. A _source_ below, usually a bituminous shale, from whose organic\r\nmatter they have been derived by slow change.\r\n\r\n2. A _reservoir_ above, in which they have gathered. This is either a\r\nporous sandstone or a porous or creviced limestone.\r\n\r\n3. Oil and gas are lighter than water, and are usually under pressure\r\nowing to artesian water. Hence, in order to hold them from escaping to\r\nthe surface, the reservoir must have the shape of an _anticline_,\r\n_dome_, or _lens_.\r\n\r\n4. It must also have an _impervious cover_, usually a shale. In these\r\nreservoirs gas is under a pressure which is often enormous, reaching\r\nin extreme cases as high as a thousand five hundred pounds to the\r\nsquare inch. When tapped it rushes out with a deafening roar,\r\nsometimes flinging the heavy drill high in air. In accounting for this\r\npressure we must remember that the gas has been compressed within the\r\npores of the reservoir rock by artesian water, and in some cases also\r\nby its own expansive force. It is not uncommon for artesian water to\r\nrise in wells after the exhaustion of gas and oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Life of the Ordovician_\r\n\r\nDuring the ages of the Ordovician, life made great advances. Types\r\nalready present branched widely into new genera and species, and new\r\nand higher types appeared.\r\n\r\nSponges continued from the Cambrian. Graptolites now reached their\r\nclimax.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 278. Stromatopora]\r\n\r\n=Stromatopora=--colonies of minute hydrozoans allied to corals--grew\r\nin places on the sea floor, secreting stony masses composed of thin,\r\nclose, concentric layers, connected by vertical rods. The Stromatopora\r\nare among the chief limestone builders of the Silurian and Devonian\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\n=Corals= developed along several distinct lines, like modern corals\r\nthey secreted a calcareous framework, in whose outer portions the\r\npolyps lived. In the Ordovician, corals were represented chiefly by\r\nthe family of the _Chætetes_, all species of which are long since\r\nextinct. The description of other types of corals will be given under\r\nthe Silurian, where they first became abundant.\r\n\r\n=Echinoderms.= The cystoid reaches its climax, but there appear now\r\ntwo higher types of echinoderms,--the crinoid and the starfish. The\r\n_crinoid_, named from its resemblance to the lily, is like the cystoid\r\nin many respects, but has a longer stem and supports a crown of\r\nplumose arms. Stirring the water with these arms, it creates currents\r\nby which particles of food are wafted to its mouth. Crinoids are rare\r\nat the present time, but they grew in the greatest profusion in the\r\nwarm Ordovician seas and for long ages thereafter. In many places the\r\nsea floor was beautiful with these graceful, flowerlike forms, as with\r\nfields of long-stemmed lilies. Of the higher, free-moving classes of\r\nthe echinoderms, starfish are more numerous than in the Cambrian, and\r\nsea urchins make their appearance in rare archaic forms.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 279. Crinoid, a Jurassic Species]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 280. An Ordovician Starfish]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 281. An Ordovician Sea Urchin]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 282. Eurypterus]\r\n\r\n=Crustaceans.= Trilobites now reach their greatest development and\r\nmore than eleven hundred species have been described from the rocks of\r\nthis period. It is interesting to note that in many species the\r\nsegments of the thorax have now come to be so shaped that they move\r\nfreely on one another. Unlike their Cambrian ancestors, many of the\r\nOrdovician trilobites could roll themselves into balls at the approach\r\nof danger. It is in this attitude, taken at the approach of death,\r\nthat trilobites are often found in the Ordovician and later rocks. The\r\ngigantic crustaceans called the _eurypterids_ were also present in\r\nthis period (Fig. 282).\r\n\r\nThe arthropods had now seized upon the land. Centipedes and insects of\r\na low type, the earliest known land animals, have been discovered in\r\nstrata of this system.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 283. A Bryozoan]\r\n\r\n=Bryozoans.= No fossils are more common in the limestones of the time\r\nthan the small branching stems and lacelike mats of the\r\nbryozoans,--the skeletons of colonies of a minute animal allied in\r\nstructure to the brachiopod.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 284. Ordovician Brachiopods]\r\n\r\n=Brachiopods.= These multiplied greatly, and in places their shells\r\nformed thick beds of coquina. They still greatly surpassed the\r\nmollusks in numbers.\r\n\r\n=Cephalopods.= Among the mollusks we must note the evolution of the\r\ncephalopods. The primitive straight Orthoceras has now become\r\nabundant. But in addition to this ancestral type there appears a\r\nsuccession of forms more and more curved and closely coiled, as\r\nillustrated in Figure 285. The nautilus, which began its course in\r\nthis period, crawls on the bottom of our present seas.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 285. A, Cyrtoceras; B, Trochoceras; C, Lituites]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 286. Nautilus]\r\n\r\n=Vertebrates.= The most important record of the Ordovician is that of\r\nthe appearance of a new and higher type, with possibilities of\r\ndevelopment lying hidden in its structure that the mollusk and the\r\ninsect could never hope to reach. Scales and plates of minute fishes\r\nfound in the Ordovician rocks near Canon City, Colorado, show that the\r\nhumblest of the vertebrates had already made its appearance. But it is\r\nprobable that vertebrates had been on the earth for ages before this\r\nin lowly types, which, being destitute of hard parts, would leave no\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Silurian\r\n\r\nThe narrowing of the seas and the emergence of the lands which\r\ncharacterized the closing epoch of the Ordovician in eastern North\r\nAmerica continue into the succeeding period of the Silurian. New\r\nspecies appear and many old species now become extinct.\r\n\r\n=The Appalachian region.= Where the Silurian system is most fully\r\ndeveloped, from New York southward along the Appalachian Mountains, it\r\ncomprises four series:\r\n\r\n  4 Salina   .....  shales, impure limestones, gypsum, salt\r\n  3 Niagara  .....  chiefly limestones\r\n  2 Clinton  .....  sandstones, shales, with some limestones\r\n  1 Medina   .....  conglomerates, sandstones\r\n\r\nThe rocks of these series are shallow-water deposits and reach the\r\ntotal thickness of some five thousand feet. Evidently they were laid\r\nover an area which was on the whole gradually subsiding, although with\r\nvarious gentle oscillations which are recorded in the different\r\nformations. The coarse sands of the heavy Medina formations record a\r\nperiod of uplift of the oldland of Appalachia, when erosion went on\r\nrapidly and coarse waste in abundance was brought down from the hills\r\nby swift streams and spread by the waves in wide, sandy flats. As the\r\nlands were worn lower the waste became finer, and during an epoch of\r\ntransition--the Clinton--there were deposited various formations of\r\nsandstones, shales, and limestones. The Niagara limestones testify to\r\na long epoch of repose, when low-lying lands sent little waste down to\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nThe gypsum and salt deposits of the Salina show that toward the close\r\nof the Silurian period a slight oscillation brought the sea floor\r\nnearer to the surface, and at the north cut off extensive tracts from\r\nthe interior sea. In these wide lagoons, which now and then regained\r\naccess to the open sea and obtained new supplies of salt water, beds\r\nof salt and gypsum were deposited as the briny waters became\r\nconcentrated by evaporation under a desert climate. Along with these\r\nbeds there were also laid shales and impure limestones.\r\n\r\nIn New York the \"salt pans\" of the Salina extended over an area one\r\nhundred and fifty miles long from east to west and sixty miles wide,\r\nand similar salt marshes occurred as far west as Cleveland, Ohio, and\r\nGoderich on Lake Huron. At Ithaca, New York, the series is fifteen\r\nhundred feet thick, and is buried beneath an equal thickness of later\r\nstrata. It includes two hundred and fifty feet of solid salt, in\r\nseveral distinct beds, each sealed within the shales of the series.\r\n\r\nWould you expect to find ancient beds of rock salt inclosed in beds of\r\npervious sandstone?\r\n\r\nThe salt beds of the Salina are of great value. They are reached by\r\nwell borings, and their brines are evaporated by solar heat and by\r\nboiling. The rock salt is also mined from deep shafts.\r\n\r\nSimilar deposits of salt, formed under like conditions, occur in the\r\nrocks of later systems down to the present. The salt beds of Texas are\r\nPermian, those of Kansas are Permian, and those of Louisiana are\r\nTertiary.\r\n\r\n=The Mississippi valley.= The heavy near-shore formations of the\r\nSilurian in the Appalachian region thin out toward the west. The\r\nMedina and the Clinton sandstones are not found west of Ohio, where\r\nthe first passes into a shale and the second into a limestone. The\r\nNiagara limestone, however, spreads from the Hudson River to beyond\r\nthe Mississippi, a distance of more than a thousand miles. During the\r\nSilurian period the Mississippi valley region was covered with a\r\nquiet, shallow, limestone-making sea, which received little waste from\r\nthe low lands which bordered it.\r\n\r\nThe probable distribution of land and sea in eastern North America and\r\nwestern Europe is shown in Figure 287. The fauna of the interior\r\nregion and of eastern Canada are closely allied with that of western\r\nEurope, and several species are identical. We can hardly account for\r\nthis except by a shallow-water connection between the two ancient\r\nepicontinental seas. It was perhaps along the coastal shelves of a\r\nnorthern land connecting America and Europe by way of Greenland and\r\nIceland that the migration took place, so that the same species came\r\nto live in Iowa and in Sweden.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 287. Hypothetical Map of Parts of North America\r\n       and Europe in Silurian Time.\r\n\r\n    Shaded areas, probably seas; broken lines, approximate shore lines]\r\n\r\n=The western United States.= So little is found of the rocks of the\r\nsystem west of the Missouri River that it is quite probable that the\r\nwestern part of the United States had for the most part emerged from\r\nthe sea at the close of the Ordovician and remained land during the\r\nSilurian. At the same time the western land was perhaps connected with\r\nthe eastern land of Appalachia across Arkansas and Mississippi; for\r\ntoward the south the Silurian sediments indicate an approach to shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Life of the Silurian_\r\n\r\nIn this brief sketch it is quite impossible to relate the many changes\r\nof species and genera during the Silurian.\r\n\r\n=Corals.= Some of the more common types are familiarly known as cup\r\ncorals, honeycomb corals, and chain corals. In the _cup corals_ the\r\nmost important feature is the development of radiating vertical\r\npartitions, or _septa_, in the cell of the polyp. Some of the cup\r\ncorals grew in hemispherical colonies (Fig. 288), while many were\r\nseparate individuals (Fig. 289), building a single conical, or\r\nhorn-shaped cell, which sometimes reached the extreme size of a foot\r\nin length and two or three inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 288. A Compound Cup Coral]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 289. A Simple Cup Coral]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 290. Honeycomb Corals]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 291. A Chain Coral]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 292. A Syringopora Coral]\r\n\r\n_Honeycomb corals_ consist of masses of small, close-set prismatic\r\ncells, each crossed by horizontal partitions, or _tabulæ_, while the\r\nsepta are rudimentary, being represented by faintly projecting ridges\r\nor rows of spines.\r\n\r\n_Chain corals_ are also marked by tabulæ. Their cells form elliptical\r\ntubes, touching each other at the edges, and appearing in cross\r\nsection like the links of a chain. They became extinct at the end of\r\nthe Silurian.\r\n\r\nThe corals of the _Syringopora_ family are similar in structure to\r\nchain corals, but the tubular columns are connected only in places.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 293. A Blastoid: A, side view, showing\r\n      portion of the stem; B, summit of calyx (species\r\n      Carboniferous)]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 294. A Silurian Scorpion]\r\n\r\nTo the echinoderms there is now added the _blastoid_ (bud-shaped). The\r\nblastoid is stemmed and armless, and its globular \"head\" or \"calyx,\"\r\nwith its five petal-like divisions, resembles a flower bud. The\r\nblastoids became more abundant in the Devonian, culminated in the\r\nCarboniferous, and disappeared at the end of the Paleozoic.\r\n\r\nThe great eurypterids--some of which were five or six feet in\r\nlength--and the cephalopods were still masters of the seas. Fishes\r\nwere as yet few and small; trilobites and graptolites had now passed\r\ntheir prime and had diminished greatly in numbers. Scorpions are found\r\nin this period both in Europe and in America. The limestone-making\r\nseas of the Silurian swarmed with corals, crinoids, and brachiopods.\r\n\r\nWith the end of the Silurian period the _Age of Invertebrates_ comes\r\nto a close, giving place to the Devonian, the _Age of Fishes_.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 295. Block of Limestone showing Interior Casts of\r\n      _Pentamerus oblongus_, a Common Silurian Brachiopod]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE DEVONIAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn America the Silurian is not separated from the Devonian by any\r\nmountain-making deformation or continental uplift. The one period\r\npassed quietly into the other. Their conformable systems are so\r\nclosely related, and the change in their faunas is so gradual, that\r\ngeologists are not agreed as to the precise horizon which divides\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n=Subdivisions and physical geography.= The Devonian is represented in\r\nNew York and southward by the following five series. We add the rocks\r\nof which they are chiefly composed.\r\n\r\n  5 Chemung      .....  sandstones and sandy shales\r\n  4 Hamilton     .....  shales and sandstones\r\n  3 Corniferous  .....  limestones\r\n  2 Oriskany     .....  sandstones\r\n  1 Helderberg   .....  limestones\r\n\r\nThe Helderberg is a transition epoch referred by some geologists to\r\nthe Silurian. The thin sandstones of the Oriskany mark an epoch when\r\nwaves worked over the deposits of former coastal plains. The\r\nlimestones of the Corniferous testify to a warm and clear wide sea\r\nwhich extended from the Hudson to beyond the Mississippi. Corals\r\nthrove luxuriantly, and their remains, with those of mollusks and\r\nother lime-secreting animals, built up great beds of limestone. The\r\nbordering continents, as during the later Silurian, must now have been\r\nmonotonous lowlands which sent down little of even the finest waste to\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nIn the Hamilton the clear seas of the previous epoch became clouded\r\nwith mud. The immense deposits of coarse sandstones and sandy shales\r\nof the Chemung, which are found off what was at the time the west\r\ncoast of Appalachia, prove an uplift of that ancient continent.\r\n\r\nThe Chemung series extends from the Catskill Mountains to northeastern\r\nOhio and south to northeastern Tennessee, covering an area of not less\r\nthan a hundred thousand square miles. In eastern New York it attains\r\nthree thousand feet in thickness; in Pennsylvania it reaches the\r\nenormous thickness of two miles; but it rapidly thins to the west.\r\nEverywhere the Chemung is made of thin beds of rapidly alternating\r\ncoarse and fine sands and clays, with an occasional pebble layer, and\r\nhence is a shallow-water deposit. The fine material has not been\r\nthoroughly winnowed from the coarse by the long action of strong waves\r\nand tides. The sands and clays have undergone little more sorting than\r\nis done by rivers. We must regard the Chemung sandstones as deposits\r\nmade at the mouths of swift, turbid rivers in such great amount that\r\nthey could be little sorted and distributed by waves.\r\n\r\nOver considerable areas the Chemung sandstones bear little or no trace\r\nof the action of the sea. The Catskill Mountains, for example, have as\r\ntheir summit layers some three thousand feet of coarse red sandstones\r\nof this series, whose structure is that of river deposits, and whose\r\nfew fossils are chiefly of fresh-water types. The Chemung is therefore\r\ncomposed of delta deposits, more or less worked over by the sea. The\r\nbulk of the Chemung equals that of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. To\r\nfurnish this immense volume of sediment a great mountain range, or\r\nhighland, must have been upheaved where the Appalachian lowland long\r\nhad been. To what height the Devonian mountains of Appalachia attained\r\ncannot be told from the volume of the sediments wasted from them, for\r\nthey may have risen but little faster than they were worn down by\r\ndenudation. We may infer from the character of the waste which they\r\nfurnished to the Chemung shores that they did not reach an Alpine\r\nheight. The grains of the Chemung sandstones are not those which would\r\nresult from mechanical disintegration, as by frost on high mountain\r\npeaks, but are rather those which would be left from the long chemical\r\ndecay of siliceous crystalline rocks; for the more soluble minerals\r\nare largely wanting. The red color of much of the deposits points to\r\nthe same conclusion. Red residual clays accumulated on the mountain\r\nsides and upland summits, and were washed as ocherous silt to mingle\r\nwith the delta sands. The iron-bearing igneous rocks of the oldland\r\nalso contributed by their decay iron in solution to the rivers, to be\r\ndeposited in films of iron oxide about the quartz grains of the\r\nChemung sandstones, giving them their reddish tints.\r\n\r\n\r\nLife of the Devonian\r\n\r\n=Plants.= The lands were probably clad with verdure during Silurian\r\ntimes, if not still earlier; for some rare remains of ferns and other\r\nlowly types of vegetation have been found in the strata of that\r\nsystem. But it is in the Devonian that we discover for the first time\r\nthe remains of extensive and luxuriant forests. This rich flora\r\nreached its climax in the Carboniferous, and it will be more\r\nconvenient to describe its varied types in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n=Rhizocarps.= In the shales of the Devonian are found microscopic\r\nspores of rhizocarps in such countless numbers that their weight must\r\nbe reckoned in hundreds of millions of tons. It would seem that these\r\naquatic plants culminated in this period, and in widely distant\r\nportions of the earth swampy flats and shallow lagoons were filled\r\nwith vegetation of this humble type, either growing from the bottom or\r\nfloating free upon the surface. It is to the resinous spores of the\r\nrhizocarps that the petroleum and natural gas from Devonian rocks are\r\nlargely due. The decomposition of the spores has made the shales\r\nhighly bituminous, and the oil and gas have accumulated in the\r\nreservoirs of overlying porous sandstones.\r\n\r\n=Invertebrates.= We must pass over the ever-changing groups of the\r\ninvertebrates with the briefest notice. Chain corals became extinct at\r\nthe close of the Silurian, but other corals were extremely common in\r\nthe Devonian seas. At many places corals formed thin reefs, as at\r\nLouisville, Kentucky, where the hardness of the reef rock is one of\r\nthe causes of the Falls of the Ohio.\r\n\r\nSponges, echinoderms, brachiopods, and mollusks were abundant. The\r\ncephalopods take a new departure. So far in all their various forms,\r\nwhether straight, as the Orthoceras, or curved, or close-coiled as in\r\nthe nautilus, the septum, or partition dividing the chambers, met the\r\ninner shell along a simple line, like that of the rim of a saucer.\r\nThere now begins a growth of the septum by which its edges become\r\nsharply corrugated, and the suture, or line of juncture of the septum\r\nand the shell, is thus angled. The group in which this growth of the\r\nseptum takes place is called the _Goniatite_ (Greek _gonia_, angle).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 296. A Goniatite]\r\n\r\n=Vertebrates.= It is with the greatest interest that we turn now to\r\nstudy the backboned animals of the Devonian; for they are believed to\r\nbe the ancestors of the hosts of vertebrates which have since\r\ndominated the earth. Their rudimentary structures foreshadowed what\r\ntheir descendants were to be, and give some clue to the earliest\r\nvertebrates from which they sprang. Like those whose remains are found\r\nin the lower Paleozoic systems, all of these Devonian vertebrates were\r\naquatic and go under the general designation of fishes.\r\n\r\nThe lowest in grade and nearest, perhaps, to the ancestral type of\r\nvertebrates, was the problematic creature, an inch or so long, of\r\nFigure 297. Note the circular mouth not supplied with jaws, the lack\r\nof paired fins, and the symmetric tail fin, with the column of\r\ncartilaginous, ringlike vertebræ running through it to the end. The\r\nanimal is probably to be placed with the jawless lampreys and hags,--a\r\ngroup too low to be included among true fishes.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 297. Palæospondylus]\r\n\r\n=Ostracoderms.= This archaic group, long since extinct, is also too\r\nlowly to rank among the true fishes, for its members have neither jaws\r\nnor paired fins. These small, fishlike forms were cased in front with\r\nbony plates developed in the skin and covered in the rear with scales.\r\nThe vertebræ were not ossified, for no trace of them has been found.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 298. An Ostracoderm]\r\n\r\n=Devonian fishes.= The _true fishes_ of the Devonian can best be\r\nunderstood by reference to their descendants now living. Modern fishes\r\nare divided into several groups: _sharks_ and their allies;\r\n_dipnoans_; _ganoids_, such as the sturgeon and gar; and\r\n_teleosts_,--most common fishes, such as the perch and cod.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 299. A Paleozoic Shark]\r\n\r\n=Sharks.= Of all groups of living fishes the sharks are the oldest and\r\nstill retain most fully the embryonic characters of their Paleozoic\r\nancestors. Such characters are the cartilaginous skeleton, and the\r\nseparate gill slits with which the throat wall is pierced and which\r\nare arranged in line like the gill openings of the lamprey. The sharks\r\nof the Silurian and Devonian are known to us chiefly by their teeth\r\nand fin spines, for they were unprotected by scales or plates, and\r\nwere devoid of a bony skeleton. Figure 299 is a restoration of an\r\narchaic shark from a somewhat higher horizon. Note the seven gill\r\nslits and the lappetlike paired fins. These fins seem to be remnants\r\nof the continuous fold of skin which, as embryology teaches, passed\r\nfrom fore to aft down each side of the primitive vertebrate.\r\n\r\nDevonian sharks were comparatively small. They had not evolved into\r\nthe ferocious monsters which were later to be masters of the seas.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 300. A Devonian Dipnoan]\r\n\r\n=Dipnoans, or lung fishes.= These are represented to-day by a few\r\npeculiar fishes and are distinguished by some high structures which\r\nally them with amphibians. An air sac with cellular spaces is\r\nconnected with the gullet and serves as a rudimentary lung. It\r\ncorresponds with the swim bladder of most modern fishes, and appears\r\nto have had a common origin with it. We may conceive that the\r\nprimordial fishes not only had gills used in breathing air dissolved\r\nin water, but also developed a saclike pouch off the gullet. This sac\r\nevolved along two distinct lines. On the line of the ancestry of most\r\nmodern fishes its duct was closed and it became the swim bladder used\r\nin flotation and balancing. On another line of descent it was left\r\nopen, air was swallowed into it, and it developed into the rudimentary\r\nlung of the dipnoans and into the more perfect lungs of the amphibians\r\nand other air-breathing vertebrates.\r\n\r\nOne of the ancient dipnoans is illustrated in Figure 300. Some of the\r\nmembers of this order were, like the ostracoderms, cased in armor, but\r\ntheir higher rank is shown by their powerful jaws and by other\r\nstructures. Some of these armored fishes reached twenty-five feet in\r\nlength and six feet across the head. They were the tyrants of the\r\nDevonian seas.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 301. A Devonian Fringe-Finned Ganoid]\r\n\r\n=Ganoids.= These take their name from their enameled plates or scales\r\nof bone. The few genera now surviving are the descendants of the\r\ntribes which swarmed in the Devonian seas. A restoration of one of a\r\nleading order, the _fringe-finned_ ganoids, is given in Figure 301.\r\nThe side fins, which correspond to the limbs of the higher\r\nvertebrates, are quite unlike those of most modern fishes. Their rays,\r\ninstead of radiating from a common base, fringe a central lobe which\r\ncontains a cartilaginous axis. The teeth of the Devonian ganoids show\r\na complicated folded structure.\r\n\r\n=General characteristics of Devonian fishes.= _The notochord is\r\npersistent._ The notochord is a continuous rod of cartilage, or\r\ngristle, which in the embryological growth of vertebrate animals\r\nsupports the spinal nerve cord before the formation of the vertebræ.\r\nIn most modern fishes and in all higher vertebrates the notochord is\r\ngradually removed as the bodies of the vertebræ are formed about it;\r\nbut in the Devonian fishes it persists through maturity and the\r\nvertebræ remain incomplete.\r\n\r\n=The skeleton is cartilaginous.= This also is an embryological\r\ncharacteristic. In the Devonian fishes the vertebræ, as well as the\r\nother parts of the skeleton, have not ossified, or changed to bone,\r\nbut remain in their primitive cartilaginous condition.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 302. Vertebræ of Sturgeon in side view _A_;\r\n      and vertical transverse section _B_, showing Notochord _ch_, and\r\n      Neural Canal _m_]\r\n\r\n=The tail fin is vertebrated.= The backbone runs through the fin and is\r\nfringed above and below with its vertical rays. In some fishes with\r\nvertebrated tail fins the fin is symmetric (Fig. 300), and this seems\r\nto be the primitive type. In others the tail fin is unsymmetric: the\r\nbackbone runs into the upper lobe, leaving the two lobes of unequal\r\nsize. In most modern fishes (the _teleosts_) the tail fin is not\r\nvertebrated: the spinal column ends in a broad plate, to which the\r\ndiverging fin rays are attached.\r\n\r\nBut along with these embryonic characters, which were common to all\r\nDevonian fishes, there were other structures in certain groups which\r\nforeshadowed the higher structures of the land vertebrates which were\r\nyet to come: air sacs which were to develop into lungs, and\r\ncartilaginous axes in the side fins which were a prophecy of limbs.\r\nThe vertebrates had already advanced far enough to prove the\r\nsuperiority of their type of structure to all others. Their internal\r\nskeleton afforded the best attachment for muscles and enabled them to\r\nbecome the largest and most powerful creatures of the time. The\r\ncentral nervous system, with the predominance given to the ganglia at\r\nthe fore end of the nerve cord,--the brain,--already endowed them with\r\ngreater energy than the invertebrates; and, still more important,\r\nthese structures contained the possibility of development into the\r\nmore highly organized land vertebrates which were to rule the earth.\r\n\r\n=Teleosts.= The great group of fishes called the teleosts, or those\r\nwith complete bony skeletons, to which most modern fishes belong, may\r\nbe mentioned here, although in the Devonian they had not yet appeared.\r\nThe teleosts are a highly specialized type, adapted most perfectly to\r\ntheir aquatic environment. Heavy armor has been discarded, and\r\nreliance is placed instead on swiftness. The skeleton is completely\r\nossified and the notochord removed. The vertebræ have been\r\neconomically withdrawn from the tail, and the cartilaginous axis of\r\nthe side fins has been found unnecessary. The air sac has become a\r\nswim bladder. In this complete specialization they have long since\r\nlost the possibility of evolving into higher types.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the modern teleosts in their\r\nembryological growth pass through the stages which characterized the\r\nmaturity of their Devonian ancestors; their skeleton is cartilaginous\r\nand their tail fin vertebrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE CARBONIFEROUS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Carboniferous system is so named from the large amount of coal\r\nwhich it contains. Other systems, from the Devonian on, are coal\r\nbearing also, but none so richly and to so wide an extent. Never\r\nbefore or since have the peculiar conditions been so favorable for the\r\nformation of extensive coal deposits.\r\n\r\nWith few exceptions the Carboniferous strata rest on those of the\r\nDevonian without any marked unconformity; the one period passed\r\nquietly into the other, with no great physical disturbances.\r\n\r\nThe Carboniferous includes three distinct series. The lower is called\r\nthe _Mississippian_, from the outcrop of its formations along the\r\nMississippi River in central and southern Illinois and the adjacent\r\nportions of Iowa and Missouri. The middle series is called the\r\n_Pennsylvanian_ (or Coal Measures), from its wide occurrence over\r\nPennsylvania. The upper series is named the _Permian_, from the\r\nprovince of Perm in Russia.\r\n\r\n=The Mississippian series.= In the interior the Mississippian is\r\ncomposed chiefly of limestones, with some shales, which tell of a\r\nclear, warm, epicontinental sea swarming with crinoids, corals, and\r\nshells, and occasionally clouded with silt from the land.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern region, New York had been added by uplift to the\r\nAppalachian land which now was united to the northern area. From\r\neastern Pennsylvania southward there were laid in a subsiding trough,\r\nfirst, thick sandstones (the Pocono sandstone), and later still\r\nheavier shales,--the two together reaching the thickness of four\r\nthousand feet and more. We infer a renewed uplift of Appalachia\r\nsimilar to that of the later epochs of the Devonian, but as much less\r\nin amount as the volume of sediments is smaller.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvanian Series\r\n\r\nThe Mississippian was brought to an end by a quiet oscillation which\r\nlifted large areas slightly above the sea, and the Pennsylvanian began\r\nwith a movement in the opposite direction. The sea encroached on the\r\nnew land, and spread far and wide a great basal conglomerate and\r\ncoarse sandstones. On this ancient beach deposit a group of strata\r\nrests which we must now interpret. They consist of alternating shales\r\nand sandstones, with here and there a bed of limestone and an\r\noccasional seam of coal. A stratum of fire clay commonly underlies a\r\ncoal seam, and there occur also beds of iron ore. We give a typical\r\nsection of a very small portion of the series at a locality in\r\nPennsylvania. Although some of the minor changes are omitted, the\r\nsection shows the rapid alternation of the strata:\r\n\r\n  9 Sandstone and shale  .....  25\r\n  8 Limestone            .....  18\r\n  7 Sandstone            .....  10\r\n  6 Coal                 .....  1-6\r\n  5 Shale                .....  0-2\r\n  4 Sandstone            .....  40\r\n  3 Limestone            .....  10\r\n  2 Coal                 .....  5-12\r\n  1 Fire clay            .....   3\r\n\r\nThis section shows more coal than is usual; on the whole, coal seams\r\ndo not take up more than one foot in fifty of the Coal Measures. They\r\nvary also in thickness more than is seen in the section, some\r\nexceptional seams reaching the thickness of fifty feet.\r\n\r\n=How coal was made.= 1. Coal is of vegetable origin. Examined under\r\nthe microscope even anthracite, or hard coal, is seen to contain\r\ncarbonized vegetal tissues. There are also all gradations connecting\r\nthe hardest anthracite--through semibituminous coal, bituminous or\r\nsoft coal, lignite (an imperfect coal in which sometimes woody fibers\r\nmay be seen little changed)--with peat and decaying vegetable tissues.\r\nCoal is compressed and mineralized vegetal matter. Its varieties\r\ndepend on the perfection to which the peculiar change called\r\nbituminization has been carried, and also, as shown in the table\r\nbelow, on the degree to which the volatile substances and water have\r\nescaped, and on the per cent of carbon remaining.\r\n\r\n                   Peat           Bituminous\r\n                  Dismal  Lignite   Coal     Anthracite\r\n                  Swamp    Texas    Penn.      Penn.\r\n\r\n  Moisture        78.89    14.67     1.30       2.74\r\n  Volatile matter 13.84    37.32    20.87       4.25\r\n  Fixed carbon     6.49    41.07    67.20      81.51\r\n  Ash              0.78     6.69     8.80      10.87\r\n\r\n2. The vegetable remains associated with coal are those of land\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n3. Coal accumulated in the presence of water; for it is only when thus\r\nprotected from the air that vegetal matter is preserved.\r\n\r\n4. The vegetation of coal accumulated for the most part where it grew;\r\nit was not generally drifted and deposited by waves and currents.\r\nCommonly the fire clay beneath the seam is penetrated with roots, and\r\nthe shale above is packed with leaves of ferns and other plants as\r\nbeautifully pressed as in a herbarium. There often is associated with\r\nthe seam a fossil forest, with the stumps, which are still standing\r\nwhere they grew, their spreading roots, and the soil beneath, all\r\nchanged to stone. In the Nova Scotia field, out of seventy-six\r\ndistinct coal seams, twenty are underlain by old forest grounds.\r\n\r\nThe presence of fire clay beneath a seam points in the same direction.\r\nSuch underclays withstand intense heat and are used in making fire\r\nbrick, because their alkalies have been removed by the long-continued\r\ngrowth of vegetation.\r\n\r\nFuel coal is also too pure to have been accumulated by driftage. In\r\nthat case we should expect to find it mixed with mud, while in fact it\r\noften contains no more ash than the vegetal matter would furnish from\r\nwhich it has been compressed.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 303. Fossil Tree Stumps of a Carboniferous\r\n      Forest, Scotland]\r\n\r\nThese conditions are fairly met in the great swamps of river plains\r\nand deltas and of coastal plains, such as the great Dismal Swamp,\r\nwhere thousands of generations of forests with their undergrowths\r\ncontribute their stems and leaves to form thick beds of peat. A coal\r\nseam is a fossil peat bed.\r\n\r\n=Geographical conditions during the Pennsylvanian.= The Carboniferous\r\npeat swamps were of vast extent. A map of the Coal Measures (Fig. 260)\r\nshows that the coal marshes stretched, with various interruptions of\r\nhigher ground and straits of open water, from eastern Pennsylvania\r\ninto Alabama, Texas, and Kansas. Some individual coal beds may still\r\nbe traced over a thousand square miles, despite the erosion which they\r\nhave suffered. It taxes the imagination to conceive that the varied\r\nregion included within these limits was for hundreds of thousands of\r\nyears a marshy plain covered with tropical jungles such as that\r\npictured in Figure 304.\r\n\r\nOn the basis that peat loses four fifths of its bulk in changing to\r\ncoal, we may reckon the thickness of these ancient peat beds. Coal\r\nseams six and ten feet thick, which are not uncommon, represent peat\r\nbeds thirty and fifty feet in thickness, while mammoth coal seams\r\nfifty feet thick have been compressed from peat beds two hundred and\r\nfifty feet deep.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the thousands of feet of marine and fresh-water\r\nsediments, with their repeated alternations of limestones, sandstones,\r\nand shales, in which the seams of coal occur, prove a slow subsidence,\r\nwith many changes in its rate, with halts when the land was at a\r\nstillstand, and with occasional movements upward.\r\n\r\nWhen subsidence was most rapid and long continued the sea encroached\r\nfar and wide upon the lowlands and covered the coal swamps with sands\r\nand muds and limy oozes. When subsidence slackened or ceased the land\r\ngained on the sea. Bays were barred, and lagoons as they gradually\r\nfilled with mud became marshes. River deltas pushed forward, burying\r\nwith their silts the sunken peat beds of earlier centuries, and at the\r\nsurface emerged in broad, swampy flats,--like those of the deltas of\r\nthe Mississippi and the Ganges,--which soon were covered with\r\nluxuriant forests. At times a gentle uplift brought to sea level great\r\ncoastal plains, which for ages remained mantled with the jungle, their\r\nundeveloped drainage clogged with its debris, and were then again\r\nsubmerged.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 304. Ideal Landscape of the Pennsylvanian\r\n      Epoch]\r\n\r\n=Physical geography of the several regions.= _The Acadian region_ lay\r\non the eastern side of the northern land, where now are New Brunswick\r\nand Nova Scotia, and was an immense river delta. Here river deposits\r\nrich in coal accumulated to a depth of sixteen thousand feet. The area\r\nof this coal field is estimated at about thirty-six thousand square\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n_The Appalachian region_ skirts the Appalachian oldland on the west\r\nfrom the southern boundary of New York to northern Alabama, extending\r\nwest into eastern Ohio. The Cincinnati anticline was now a peninsula,\r\nand the broad gulf which had lain between it and Appalachia was\r\ntransformed at the beginning of the Pennsylvanian into wide marshy\r\nplains, now sinking beneath the sea and now emerging from it. This\r\narea subsided during the Carboniferous period to a depth of nearly ten\r\nthousand feet.\r\n\r\n_The Central region_ lay west of the peninsula of the Cincinnati\r\nanticline, and extended from Indiana west into eastern Nebraska, and\r\nfrom central Iowa and Illinois southward about the ancient island\r\nin Missouri and Arkansas into Oklahoma and Texas. On the north\r\nthe subsidence in this area was comparatively slight, for the\r\nCarboniferous strata scarcely exceed two thousand feet in thickness.\r\nBut in Arkansas and Indian Territory the downward movement amounted to\r\nfour and five miles, as is proved by shoal water deposits of that\r\nimmense thickness.\r\n\r\nThe coal fields of Indiana, and Illinois are now separated by erosion\r\nfrom those lying west of the Mississippi River. At the south the\r\nAppalachian land seems still to have stretched away to the west across\r\nLouisiana and Mississippi into Texas, and this westward extension\r\nformed the southern boundary of the coal marshes of the continent.\r\n\r\nThe three regions just mentioned include the chief Carboniferous coal\r\nfields of North America. Including a field in central Michigan\r\nevidently formed in an inclosed basin (Fig. 260), and one in Rhode\r\nIsland, the total area of American coal fields has been reckoned at\r\nnot less than two hundred thousand square miles. We can hardly\r\nestimate the value of these great stores of fossil fuel to an\r\nindustrial civilization. The forests of the coal swamps accumulated in\r\ntheir woody tissues the energy which they received from the sun in\r\nlight and heat, and it is this solar energy long stored in coal seams\r\nwhich now forms the world's chief source of power in manufacturing.\r\n\r\n=The western area.= On the Great Plains beyond the Missouri River the\r\nCarboniferous strata pass under those of more recent systems. Where\r\nthey reappear, as about dissected mountain axes or on stripped\r\nplateaus, they consist wholly of marine deposits and are devoid of\r\ncoal. The rich coal fields of the West are of later date.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the Carboniferous seems to have been a time of subsidence\r\nin the West. Throughout the period a sea covered the Great Basin and\r\nthe plateaus of the Colorado River. At the time of the greatest\r\ndepression the sites of the central chains of the Rockies were\r\nprobably islands, but early in the period they may have been connected\r\nwith the broad lands to the south and east. Thousands of feet of\r\nCarboniferous sediments were deposited where the Sierra Nevada\r\nMountains now stand.\r\n\r\n=The Permian.= As the Carboniferous period drew toward its close the\r\nsea gradually withdrew from the eastern part of the continent. Where\r\nthe sea lingered in the deepest troughs, and where inclosed basins\r\nwere cut off from it, the strata of the Permian were deposited. Such\r\nare found in New Brunswick, in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, in\r\nTexas, and in Kansas. In southwestern Kansas extensive Permian beds of\r\nrock salt and gypsum show that here lay great salt lakes in which\r\nthese minerals were precipitated as their brines grew dense and dried\r\naway.\r\n\r\nIn the southern hemisphere the Permian deposits are so extraordinary\r\nthat they deserve a brief notice, although we have so far omitted\r\nmention of the great events which characterized the evolution of other\r\ncontinents than our own. The Permian fauna-flora of Australia, India,\r\nSouth Africa, and the southern part of South America are so similar\r\nthat the inference is a reasonable one that these widely separated\r\nregions were then connected together, probably as extensions of a\r\ngreat antarctic continent.\r\n\r\nInterbedded with the Permian strata of the first three countries named\r\nare extensive and thick deposits of a peculiar nature which are\r\nclearly ancient ground moraines. Clays and sand, now hardened to firm\r\nrock, are inset with unsorted stones of all sizes, which often are\r\nfaceted and scratched. Moreover, these bowlder clays rest on rock\r\npavements which are polished and scored with glacial markings. Hence\r\ntoward the close of the Paleozoic the southern lands of the eastern\r\nhemisphere were invaded by great glaciers or perhaps by ice sheets\r\nlike that which now shrouds Greenland.\r\n\r\nThese Permian ground moraines are not the first traces of the work of\r\nglaciers met with in the geological record. Similar deposits prove\r\nglaciation in Norway succeeding the pre-Cambrian stage of elevation,\r\nand Cambrian glacial drift has recently been found in China.\r\n\r\n=The Appalachian deformation.= We have seen that during Paleozoic\r\ntimes a long, narrow trough of the sea lay off the western coast of\r\nthe ancient land of Appalachia, where now are the Appalachian\r\nMountains. During the long ages of this era the trough gradually\r\nsubsided, although with many stillstands and with occasional slight\r\noscillations upward. Meanwhile the land lying to the east was\r\ngradually uplifted at varying rates and with long pauses. The waste of\r\nthe rising land was constantly transferred to the sinking marginal sea\r\nbottom, and on the whole the trough was filled with sediments as\r\nrapidly as it subsided. The sea was thus kept shallow, and at times,\r\nespecially toward the close of the era, much of the area was upbuilt\r\nor raised to low, marshy, coastal plains. When the Carboniferous was\r\nended the waste which had been removed from the land and laid along\r\nits margin in the successive formations of the Paleozoic had reached a\r\nthickness of between thirty and forty thousand feet.\r\n\r\nBoth by sedimentation and by subsidence the trough had now become a\r\nbelt of weakness in the crust of the earth. Here the crust was now\r\nmade of layers to the depth of six or seven miles. In comparison with\r\nthe massive crystalline rocks of Appalachia on the east, the layered\r\nrock of the trough was weak to resist lateral pressure, as a ream of\r\nsheets of paper is weak when compared with a solid board of the same\r\nthickness. It was weaker also than the region to the west, since there\r\nthe sediments were much thinner. Besides, by the long-continued\r\ndepression the strata of the trough had been bent from the flat-lying\r\nattitude in which they were laid to one in which they were less able\r\nto resist a horizontal thrust.\r\n\r\nThere now occurred one of the critical stages in the history of the\r\nplanet, when the crust crumples under its own weight and shrinks down\r\nupon a nucleus which is diminishing in volume and no longer able to\r\nsupport it. Under slow but resistless pressure the strata of the\r\nAppalachian trough were thrust against the rigid land, and slowly,\r\nsteadily bent into long folds whose axes ran northeast-southwest\r\nparallel to the ancient coast line. It was on the eastern side next\r\nthe buttress of the land that the deformation was the greatest, and\r\nthe folds most steep and close. In central Pennsylvania and West\r\nVirginia the folds were for the most part open. South of these states\r\nthe folds were more closely appressed, the strata were much broken,\r\nand the great thrust faults were formed which have been described\r\nalready. In eastern Pennsylvania seams of bituminous coal were altered\r\nto anthracite, while outside the region of strong deformation, as in\r\nwestern Pennsylvania, they remained unchanged. An important factor in\r\nthe deformation was the massive limestones of the Cambrian-Ordovician.\r\nBecause of these thick, resistant beds the rocks were bent into wide\r\nfolds and sheared in places with great thrust faults. Had the strata\r\nbeen weak shales, an equal pressure would have crushed and mashed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAlthough the great earth folds were slowly raised, and no doubt eroded\r\nin their rising, they formed in all probability a range of lofty\r\nmountains, with a width of from fifty to a hundred and twenty-five\r\nmiles, which stretched from New York to central Alabama.\r\n\r\nFrom their bases lowlands extended westward to beyond the Missouri\r\nRiver. At the same time ranges were upridged out of thick Paleozoic\r\nsediments both in the Bay of Fundy region and in the Indian Territory.\r\nThe eastern portion of the North American continent was now well-nigh\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nThe date of the Appalachian deformation is told in the usual way. The\r\nCarboniferous strata, nearly two miles thick, are all infolded in the\r\nAppalachian ridges, while the next deposits found in this\r\nregion--those of the later portion of the first period (the Trias) of\r\nthe succeeding era--rest unconformably on the worn edges of the\r\nAppalachian folded strata. The deformation therefore took place about\r\nthe close of the Paleozoic. It seems to have begun in the Permian, in,\r\neastern Pennsylvania,--for here the Permian strata are wanting,--and\r\nto have continued into the Trias, whose earlier formations are absent\r\nover all the area.\r\n\r\nWith this wide uplift the subsidence of the sea floor which had so\r\nlong been general in eastern North America came to an end. Deposition\r\nnow gave place to erosion. The sedimentary record of the Paleozoic was\r\nclosed, and after an unknown lapse of time, here unrecorded, the\r\nannals of the succeeding era were written under changed conditions.\r\n\r\nIn western North America the closing stages of the Paleozoic were\r\nmarked by important oscillations. The Great Basin, which had long been\r\na mediterranean sea, was converted into land over western Utah and\r\neastern Nevada, while the waves of the Pacific rolled across\r\nCalifornia and western Nevada.\r\n\r\nThe absence of tuffs and lavas among the Carboniferous strata of North\r\nAmerica shows that here volcanic action was singularly wanting during\r\nthe entire period. Even the Appalachian deformation was not\r\naccompanied by any volcanic outbursts.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 305. Carboniferous Ferns]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 306. Calamites]\r\n\r\n\r\nLife of the Carboniferous\r\n\r\n=Plants.= The gloomy forests and dense undergrowths of the\r\nCarboniferous jungles would appear unfamiliar to us could we see them\r\nas they grew, and even a botanist would find many of their forms\r\nperplexing and hard to classify. None of our modern trees would meet\r\nthe eye. Plants with conspicuous flowers of fragrance and beauty were\r\nyet to come. Even mosses and grasses were still absent.\r\n\r\nTree ferns lifted their crowns of feathery fronds high in air on\r\ntrunks of woody tissue; and lowly herbaceous ferns, some belonging to\r\nexisting families, carpeted the ground. Many of the fernlike forms,\r\nhowever, have distinct affinities with the cycads, of which they may\r\nbe the ancestors, and some bear seeds and must be classed as\r\ngymnosperms.\r\n\r\nDense thickets, like cane or bamboo brakes, were composed of thick\r\nclumps of _Calamites_, whose slender, jointed stems shot up to a\r\nheight of forty feet, and at the joints bore slender branches set\r\nwith whorls of leaves. These were close allies of the Equiseta or\r\n\"horsetails,\" of the present; but they bore characteristics of higher\r\nclasses in the woody structures of their stems.\r\n\r\nThere were also vast monotonous forests, composed chiefly of trees\r\nbelonging to the lycopods, and whose nearest relatives to-day are the\r\nlittle club mosses of our eastern woods. Two families of lycopods\r\ndeserve special mention,--the Lepidodendrons and the Sigillaria.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 307. Lepidodendron]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 308. Sigillaria]\r\n\r\nThe _Lepidodendron_, or \"scale tree,\" was a gigantic club moss fifty\r\nand seventy-five feet high, spreading toward the top into stout\r\nbranches, at whose ends were borne cone-shaped spore cases. The\r\nyounger parts of the tree were clothed with stiff needle-shaped\r\nleaves, but elsewhere the trunk and branches were marked with\r\nscalelike scars, left by the fallen leaves, and arranged in spiral\r\nrows.\r\n\r\nThe _Sigillaria_, or \"seal tree,\" was similar to the Lepidodendron,\r\nbut its fluted trunk divided into even fewer branches, and was dotted\r\nwith vertical rows of leaf scars, like the impressions of a seal.\r\n\r\nBoth Lepidodendron and Sigillaria were anchored by means of great\r\ncablelike underground stems, which ran to long distances through the\r\nmarshy ground. The trunks of both trees had a thick woody rind,\r\ninclosing loose cellular tissue and a pith. Their hollow stumps,\r\nfilled with sand and mud, are common in the Coal Measures, and in them\r\none sometimes finds leaves and stems, land shells, and the bones of\r\nlittle reptiles of the time which made their home there.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that some of these gigantic lycopods, which\r\nare classed with the _cryptogams_, or flowerless plants, had pith and\r\nmedullary rays dividing their cylinders into woody wedges. These\r\ncharacters connect them with the _phanerogams_, or flowering plants.\r\nLike so many of the organisms of the remote past, they were connecting\r\ntypes from which groups now widely separated have diverged.\r\n\r\nGymnosperms, akin to the cycads, were also present in the\r\nCarboniferous forests. Such were the different species of _Cordaites_,\r\ntrees pyramidal in shape, with strap-shaped leaves and nutlike fruit.\r\nOther gymnosperms were related to the yews, and it was by these that\r\nmany of the fossil nuts found in the Coal Measures were borne. It is\r\nthought by some that the gymnosperms had their station on the drier\r\nplains and higher lands.\r\n\r\nThe Carboniferous jungles extended over parts of Europe and of Asia,\r\nas well as eastern North America, and reached from the equator to\r\nwithin nine degrees of the north pole. Even in these widely separated\r\nregions the genera and species of coal plants are close akin and often\r\nidentical.\r\n\r\n=Invertebrates.= Among the echinoderms, crinoids are now exceedingly\r\nabundant, sea urchins are more plentiful, and sea cucumbers are found\r\nnow for the first time. Trilobites are rapidly declining, and pass\r\naway forever with the close of the period. Eurypterids are common;\r\nstinging scorpions are abundant; and here occur the first-known\r\nspiders.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the arthropods were the first of all animals to\r\nconquer the realm of the air, the earliest insects appearing in the\r\nOrdovician. Insects had now become exceedingly abundant, and the\r\nCarboniferous forests swarmed with the ancestral types of dragon\r\nflies,--some with a spread of wing of more than two feet,--May flies,\r\ncrickets, and locusts. Cockroaches infested the swamps, and one\r\nhundred and thirty-three species of this ancient order have been\r\ndiscovered in the Carboniferous of North America. The higher\r\nflower-loving insects are still absent; the reign of the flowering\r\nplants has not yet begun. The Paleozoic insects were generalized types\r\nconnecting the present orders. Their fore wings were still membranous\r\nand delicately veined, and used in flying; they had not yet become\r\nthick, and useful only as wing covers, as in many of their\r\ndescendants.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 309. Carboniferous Brachiopods\r\n\r\n   _A_, Productus; _B_, Spirifer, the right-hand figure showing the\r\n   interior with the calcareous spires for the support of the arms]\r\n\r\n=Fishes= still held to the Devonian types, with the exception that the\r\nstrange ostracoderms now had perished.\r\n\r\n=Amphibians.= The vertebrates had now followed the arthropods and the\r\nmollusks upon the land, and developed a higher type adapted to the new\r\nenvironment. Amphibians--the class to which frogs and salamanders\r\nbelong--now appear, with lungs for breathing air and with limbs for\r\nlocomotion on the land. Most of the Carboniferous amphibians were shaped\r\nlike the salamander, with weak limbs adapted more for crawling than for\r\ncarrying the body well above the ground. some legless, degenerate forms\r\nwere snakelike in shape.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 310. A Carboniferous Dragon Fly\r\n\r\n   One tenth natural size]\r\n\r\nThe earliest amphibians differ from those of to-day in a number of\r\nrespects. They were connecting types linking together fishes, from\r\nwhich they were descended, with reptiles, of which they were the\r\nancestors. They retained the evidence of their close relationship with\r\nthe Devonian fishes in their cold blood, their gills and aquatic habit\r\nduring their larval stage, their teeth with dentine infolded like\r\nthose of the Devonian ganoids but still more intricately, and their\r\nbiconcave vertebræ which never completely ossified. These, the\r\nhighest vertebrates of the time, had not yet advanced beyond the\r\nembryonic stage of the more or less cartilaginous skeleton and the\r\npersistent notochord.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 311. A Carboniferous Amphibian]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 312. Transverse Section of\r\n   Segment of Tooth of Carboniferous Amphibian]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the skull of the Carboniferous amphibians was made\r\nof close-set bony plates, like the skull of the reptile, rather than\r\nlike that of the frog, with its open spaces (Figs. 313 and 314).\r\nUnlike modern amphibians, with their slimy skin, the Carboniferous\r\namphibians wore an armor of bony scales over the ventral surface and\r\nsometimes over the back as well.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 313. Skull of a Permian Amphibian from Texas]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 314. Skull of a Frog]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice from the footprints and skeletons of these\r\nearliest-known vertebrates of the land what was the primitive number\r\nof digits. The Carboniferous amphibians had five-toed feet, the\r\nprimitive type of foot, from which their descendants of higher orders,\r\nwith a smaller number of digits, have diverged.\r\n\r\nThe Carboniferous was the age of lycopods and amphibians, as the\r\nDevonian had been the age of rhizocarps and fishes.\r\n\r\n=Life of the Permian.= The close of the Paleozoic was, as we have\r\nseen, a time of marked physical changes. The upridging of the\r\nAppalachians had begun and a wide continental uplift--proved by the\r\nabsence of Permian deposits over large areas where sedimentation had\r\ngone on before--opened new lands for settlement to hordes of\r\nair-breathing animals. Changes of climate compelled extensive\r\nmigrations, and the fauna of different regions were thus brought into\r\nconflict. The Permian was a time of pronounced changes in plant and\r\nanimal life, and a transitional period between two great eras. The\r\nsomber forests of the earlier Carboniferous, with their gigantic club\r\nmosses, were now replaced by forests of cycads, tree ferns, and\r\nconifers. Even in the lower Permian the Lepidodendron and Sigillaria\r\nwere very rare, and before the end of the epoch they and the Calamites\r\nalso had become extinct. Gradually the antique types of the Paleozoic\r\nfauna died out, and in the Permian rocks are found the last survivors\r\nof the cystoid, the trilobite, and the eurypterid, and of many\r\nlong-lived families of brachiopods, mollusks, and other invertebrates.\r\nThe venerable Orthoceras and the Goniatite linger on through the epoch\r\nand into the first period of the succeeding era. Forerunners of the\r\ngreat ammonite family of cephalopod mollusks now appear. The antique\r\nforms of the earlier Carboniferous amphibians continue, but with many\r\nnew genera and a marked increase in size.\r\n\r\nA long forward step had now been taken in the evolution of the\r\nvertebrates. A new and higher type, the reptiles, had appeared, and in\r\nsuch numbers and variety are they found in the Permian strata that\r\ntheir advent may well have occurred in a still earlier epoch. It will\r\nbe most convenient to describe the Permian reptiles along with their\r\ndescendants of the Mesozoic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE MESOZOIC\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the close of the Permian the world of animal and vegetable\r\nlife had so changed that the line is drawn here which marks the\r\nend of the old order and the beginning of the new and separates\r\nthe Paleozoic from the succeeding era,--the Mesozoic, the Middle\r\nAge of geological history. Although the Mesozoic era is shorter\r\nthan the Paleozoic, as measured by the thickness of their strata,\r\nyet its duration must be reckoned in millions of years. Its\r\npredominant life features are the culmination and the beginning of\r\nthe decline of reptiles, amphibians, cephalopod mollusks, and\r\ncycads, and the advent of marsupial mammals, birds, teleost\r\nfishes, and angiospermous plants. The leading events of the long\r\nages of the era we can sketch only in the most summary way.\r\n\r\nThe Mesozoic comprises three systems,--the _Triassic_, named from\r\nits threefold division in Germany; the _Jurassic_, which is well\r\ndisplayed in the Jura Mountains; and the _Cretaceous_, which\r\ncontains the extensive chalk (Latin, _creta_) deposits of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn eastern North America the Mesozoic rocks are much less\r\nimportant than the Paleozoic, for much of this portion of the\r\ncontinent was land during the Mesozoic era, and the area of the\r\nMesozoic rocks is small. In western North America, on the other\r\nhand, the strata of the Mesozoic--and of the Cenozoic also--are\r\nwidely spread. The Paleozoic rocks are buried quite generally from\r\nview except where the mountain makings and continental uplifts of\r\nthe Mesozoic and Cenozoic have allowed profound erosion to bring\r\nthem to light, as in deep canyons and about mountain axes. The\r\nrecord of many of the most important events in the development of\r\nthe continent during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras is found in\r\nthe rocks of our western states.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Triassic and Jurassic\r\n\r\n=Eastern North America.= The sedimentary record interrupted by the\r\nAppalachian deformation was not renewed in eastern North America\r\nuntil late in the Triassic. Hence during this long interval the\r\nland stood high, the coast was farther out than now, and over our\r\nAtlantic states geological time was recorded chiefly in erosion\r\nforms of hill and plain which have long since vanished. The area\r\nof the later Triassic rocks of this region, which take up again\r\nthe geological record, is seen in the map of Figure 260. They lie\r\non the upturned and eroded edges of the older rocks and occupy\r\nlong troughs running for the most part parallel to the Atlantic\r\ncoast. Evidently subsidence was in progress where these rocks were\r\ndeposited. The eastern border of Appalachia was now depressed. The\r\noldland was warping, and long belts of country lying parallel to\r\nthe shore subsided, forming troughs in which thousands of feet of\r\nsediment now gathered.\r\n\r\nThese Triassic rocks, which are chiefly sandstones, hold no marine\r\nfossils, and hence were not laid in open arms of the sea. But\r\ntheir layers are often ripple-marked, and contain many tracks of\r\nreptiles, imprints of raindrops, and some fossil wood, while an\r\noccasional bed of shale is filled with the remains of fishes. We\r\nmay conceive, then, of the Connecticut valley and the larger\r\ntrough to the southwest as basins gradually sinking at a rate\r\nperhaps no faster than that of the New Jersey coast to-day, and as\r\ngradually aggraded by streams from the neighboring uplands. Their\r\nbroad, sandy flats were overflowed by wandering streams, and when\r\nsubsidence gained on deposition shallow lakes overspread the\r\nalluvial plains. Perhaps now and then the basins became long,\r\nbrackish estuaries, whose low shores were swept by the incoming\r\ntide and were in turn left bare at its retreat to receive the rain\r\nprints of passing showers and the tracks of the troops of reptiles\r\nwhich inhabited these valleys.\r\n\r\nThe Triassic rocks are mainly red sandstones,--often feldspathic,\r\nor arkose, with some conglomerates and shales. Considering the\r\nlarge amount of feldspathic material in these rocks, do you infer\r\nthat they were derived from the adjacent crystalline and\r\nmetamorphic rocks of the oldland of Appalachia, or from the\r\nsedimentary Paleozoic rocks which had been folded into mountains\r\nduring the Appalachian deformation? If from the former, was the\r\ndrainage of the northern Appalachian mountain region then, as now,\r\neastward and southeastward toward the Atlantic? The Triassic\r\nsandstones are voluminous, measuring at least a mile in thickness,\r\nand are largely of coarse waste. What do you infer as to the\r\nheight of the lands from which the waste was shed, or the\r\ndirection of the oscillation which they were then undergoing? In\r\nthe southern basins, as about Richmond, Virginia, are valuable\r\nbeds of coal; what was the physical geography of these areas when\r\nthe coal was being formed?\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 315. Section of Triassic Sandstones of the\r\n      Connecticut Valley\r\n\r\n   _ss_, sandstones; _ll_, lava sheets; _cc_, crystalline igneous\r\n   and metamorphic rocks]\r\n\r\nInterbedded with the Triassic sandstones are contemporaneous lava\r\nbeds which were fed from dikes. Volcanic action, which had been\r\nremarkably absent in eastern North America during Paleozoic times,\r\nwas well-marked in connection with the warping now in progress.\r\nThick intrusive sheets have also been driven in among the strata,\r\nas, for example, the sheet of the Palisades of the Hudson,\r\ndescribed on page 269.\r\n\r\nThe present condition of the Triassic sandstones of the\r\nConnecticut valley is seen in Figure 315. Were the beds laid in\r\ntheir present attitude? What was the nature of the deformation\r\nwhich they have suffered? When did the intrusion of lava sheets\r\ntake place relative to the deformation? What effect have these\r\nsheets on the present topography, and why? Assuming that the\r\nTriassic deformation went on more rapidly than denudation, what\r\nwas its effect on the topography of the time? Are there any of its\r\nresults remaining in the topography of to-day? Do the Triassic\r\nareas now stand higher or lower than the surrounding country, and\r\nwhy? How do the Triassic sandstones and shales compare in hardness\r\nwith the igneous and metamorphic rocks about them? The Jurassic\r\nstrata are wanting over the Triassic areas and over all of eastern\r\nNorth America. Was this region land or sea, an area of erosion or\r\nsedimentation, during the Jurassic period? In New Jersey,\r\nPennsylvania, and farther southwest the lowest strata of the next\r\nperiod, the Cretaceous, rest on the eroded edges of the earlier\r\nrocks. The surface on which they lie is worn so even that we must\r\nbelieve that at the opening of the Cretaceous the oldland of\r\nAppalachia, including the Triassic areas, had been baseleveled at\r\nleast near the coast. When, therefore, did the deformation of the\r\nTriassic rocks occur?\r\n\r\n=Western North America.= Triassic strata infolded in the Sierra\r\nNevada Mountains carry marine fossils and reach a thickness of\r\nnearly five thousand feet. California was then under water, and\r\nthe site of the Sierra was a subsiding trough slowly filling with\r\nwaste from the Great Basin land to the east.\r\n\r\nOver a long belt which reaches from Wyoming across Colorado into\r\nNew Mexico no Triassic sediments are found, nor is there any\r\nevidence that they were ever present; hence this area was high\r\nland suffering erosion during the Triassic. On each side of it, in\r\neastern Colorado and about the Black Hills, in western Texas, in\r\nUtah, over the site of the Wasatch Mountains, and southward into\r\nArizona over the plateaus trenched by the Colorado River, are\r\nlarge areas of Triassic rocks, sandstones chiefly, with some rock\r\nsalt and gypsum. Fossils are very rare and none of them marine.\r\nHere, then, lay broad shallow lakes often salt, and warped basins,\r\nin which the waste of the adjacent uplands gathered. To this\r\nsystem belong the sandstones of the Garden of the Gods in\r\nColorado, which later earth movements have upturned with the\r\nuplifted mountain flanks.\r\n\r\nThe Jurassic was marked with varied oscillations and wide changes\r\nin the outline of sea and land.\r\n\r\nJurassic shales of immense thickness--now metamorphosed into\r\nslates--are found infolded into the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Hence\r\nduring Jurassic times the Sierra trough continued to subside, and\r\nenormous deposits of mud were washed into it from the land lying\r\nto the east. Contemporaneous lava flows interbedded with the\r\nstrata show that volcanic action accompanied the downwarp, and\r\nthat molten rock was driven upward through fissures in the crust\r\nand outspread over the sea floor in sheets of lava.\r\n\r\n=The Sierra deformation.= Ever since the middle of the Silurian, the\r\nSierra trough had been sinking, though no doubt with halts and\r\ninterruptions, until it contained nearly twenty-five thousand feet\r\nof sediment. At the close of the Jurassic it yielded to lateral\r\npressure and the vast pile of strata was crumpled and upheaved\r\ninto towering mountains. The Mesozoic muds were hardened and\r\nsqueezed into slates. The rocks were wrenched and broken, and\r\nunderground waters began the work of filling their fissures with\r\ngold-bearing quartz, which was yet to wait millions of years\r\nbefore the arrival of man to mine it. Immense bodies of molten\r\nrock were intruded into the crust as it suffered deformation, and\r\nthese appear in the large areas of granite which the later\r\ndenudation of the range has brought to light.\r\n\r\nThe same movements probably uplifted the rocks of the Coast Range\r\nin a chain of islands. The whole western part of the continent was\r\nraised and its seas and lakes were for the most part drained away.\r\n\r\n=The British Isles.= The Triassic strata of the British Isles are\r\ncontinental, and include breccia beds of cemented talus, deposits\r\nof salt and gypsum, and sandstones whose rounded and polished\r\ngrains are those of the wind-blown sands of deserts. In Triassic\r\ntimes the British Isles were part of a desert extending over much\r\nof northwestern Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cretaceous\r\n\r\nThe third great system of the Mesozoic includes many formations,\r\nmarine and continental, which record a long and complicated\r\nhistory marked by great oscillations of the crust and wide changes\r\nin the outlines of sea and land.\r\n\r\n=Early Cretaceous.= In eastern North America the lowest Cretaceous\r\nseries comprises fresh-water formations which are traced from\r\nNantucket across Martha's Vineyard and Long Island, and through\r\nNew Jersey southward into Georgia. They rest unconformably on the\r\nTriassic sandstones and the older rocks of the region. The\r\nAtlantic shore line was still farther out than now in the northern\r\nstates. Again, as during the Triassic, a warping of the crust\r\nformed a long trough parallel to the coast and to the Appalachian\r\nridges, but cut off from the sea; and here the continental\r\ndeposits of the early Cretaceous were laid.\r\n\r\nAlong the Gulf of Mexico the same series was deposited under like\r\nconditions over the area known as the Mississippi embayment,\r\nreaching from Georgia northwestward into Tennessee and thence\r\nacross into Arkansas and southward into Texas.\r\n\r\nIn the Southwest the subsidence continued until the transgressing\r\nsea covered most of Mexico and Texas and extended a gulf northward\r\ninto Kansas. In its warm and quiet waters limestones accumulated\r\nto a depth of from one thousand to five thousand feet in Texas,\r\nand of more than ten thousand feet in Mexico. Meanwhile the\r\nlowlands, where the Great Plains are now, received continental\r\ndeposits; coal swamps stretched from western Montana into British\r\nColumbia.\r\n\r\n=The Middle Cretaceous.= This was a land epoch. The early Cretaceous\r\nsea retired from Texas and Mexico, for its sediments are overlain\r\nunconformably by formations of the Upper Cretaceous. So long was the\r\ntime gap between the two series that no species found in the one\r\noccurs in the other.\r\n\r\n=The Upper Cretaceous.= There now began one of the most remarkable\r\nevents in all geological history,--the great Cretaceous subsidence.\r\nIts earlier warpings were recorded in continental deposits,--wide\r\nsheets of sandstone, shale, and some coal,--which were spread from\r\nTexas to British Columbia. These continental deposits are overlain by\r\na succession of marine formations whose vast area is shown on the map,\r\nFigure 260. We may infer that as the depression of the continent\r\ncontinued the sea came in far and wide over the coast lands and the\r\nplains worn low during the previous epochs. Upper Cretaceous\r\nformations show that south of New England the waters of the Atlantic\r\nsomewhat overlapped the crystalline rocks of the Piedmont Belt and\r\nspread their waste over the submerged coastal plain. The Gulf of\r\nMexico again covered the Mississippi embayment, reaching as far north\r\nas southern Illinois, and extended over Texas. A mediterranean sea now\r\nstretched from the Gulf to the arctic regions and from central Iowa to\r\nthe eastern shore of the Great Basin land at about the longitude of\r\nSalt Lake City, the Colorado Mountains rising from it in a chain of\r\nislands. Along with minor oscillations there were laid in the interior\r\nsea various formations of sandstones, shales, and limestones, and from\r\nKansas to South Dakota beds of white chalk show that the clear, warm\r\nwaters swarmed at times with foraminiferal life whose disintegrating\r\nmicroscopic shells accumulated in this rare deposit.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 316. Hypothetical Map of Upper Cretaceous\r\n      Epicontinental Seas\r\n\r\n   Shaded areas, probable seas; broken lines, approximate shore\r\n   lines]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 317. Foraminifera from Cretaceous Chalk,\r\n      Iowa]\r\n\r\nAt this epoch a wide sea, interrupted by various islands, stretched\r\nacross Eurasia from Wales and western Spain to China, and spread\r\nsouthward over much of the Sahara. To the west its waters were clear\r\nand on its floor the crumbled remains of foraminifers gathered in\r\nheavy accumulations of calcareous ooze,--the white chalk of France and\r\nEngland. Sea urchins were also abundant, and sponges contributed their\r\nspicules to form nodules of flint.\r\n\r\n=The Laramie.= The closing stage of the Cretaceous was marked in\r\nNorth America by a slow uplift of the land. As the interior sea\r\ngradually withdrew, the warping basins of its floor were filled with\r\nwaste from the rising lands about them, and over this wide area\r\nthere were spread continental deposits in fresh-water lakes like the\r\nGreat Lakes of the present, in brackish estuaries, and in river\r\nplains, while occasional oscillations now and again let in the sea.\r\nThere were vast marshes in which there accumulated the larger part\r\nof the valuable coal seams of the West. The Laramie is the\r\ncoal-bearing series of the West, as the Pennsylvanian is of the\r\neastern part of our country.\r\n\r\n=The Rocky Mountain deformation.= At the close of the Cretaceous we\r\nenter upon an epoch of mountain-making far more extensive than any which\r\nthe continent had witnessed. The long belt lying west of the ancient\r\naxes of the Colorado Islands and east of the Great Basin land had been\r\nan area of deposition for many ages, and in its subsiding troughs\r\nPaleozoic and Mesozoic sediments had gathered to the depth of many\r\nthousand feet. And now from Mexico well-nigh to the Arctic Ocean this\r\nbelt yielded to lateral pressure. The Cretaceous limestones of Mexico\r\nwere folded into lofty mountains. A massive range was upfolded where the\r\nWasatch Mountains now are, and various ranges of the Rockies in Colorado\r\nand other states were upridged. However slowly these deformations were\r\neffected they were no doubt accompanied by world-shaking earthquakes,\r\nand it is known that volcanic eruptions took place on a magnificent\r\nscale. Outflows of lava occurred along the Wasatch, the laccoliths of\r\nthe Henry Mountains (p. 271) were formed, while the great masses of\r\nigneous rock which constitute the cores of the Spanish Peaks (p. 271)\r\nand other western mountains were thrust up amid the strata. The high\r\nplateaus from which many of these ranges rise had not yet been uplifted,\r\nand the bases of the mountains probably stood near the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nNorth America was now well-nigh completed. The mediterranean seas\r\nwhich so often had occupied the heart of the land were done away\r\nwith, and the continent stretched unbroken from the foot of the\r\nSierras on the west to the Fall Line of the Atlantic coastal plain\r\non the east.\r\n\r\n=The Mesozoic peneplain.= The immense thickness of the Mesozoic\r\nformations conveys to our minds some idea of the vast length of time\r\ninvolved in the slow progress of its successive ages. The same\r\nlesson is taught as plainly by the amount of denudation which the\r\nlands suffered during the era.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the Mesozoic saw a system of lofty mountain ranges\r\nstretching from New York into central Alabama. The end of this long\r\nera found here a wide peneplain crossed by sluggish wandering rivers\r\nand overlooked by detached hills as yet unreduced to the general\r\nlevel. The Mesozoic era was long enough for the Appalachian\r\nMountains, upridged at its beginning, to have been weathered and\r\nworn away and carried grain by grain to the sea. The same plain\r\nextended over southern New England. The Taconic range, uplifted\r\npartially at least at the close of the Ordovician, and the block\r\nmountains of the Triassic, together with the pre-Cambrian mountains\r\nof ancient Appalachia, had now all been worn to a common level with\r\nthe Allegheny ranges. The Mesozoic peneplain has been upwarped by\r\nlater crustal movements and has suffered profound erosion, but the\r\nremnants of it which remain on the upland of southern New England\r\nand the even summits of the Allegheny ridges suffice to prove that\r\nit once existed. The age of the Mesozoic peneplain is determined\r\nfrom the fact that the lower Tertiary sediments were deposited on\r\nits even surface when at the close of the era the peneplain was\r\ndepressed along its edges beneath the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nLife of the Mesozoic\r\n\r\n=Plant life of the Triassic and Jurassic.= The Carboniferous forests\r\nof lepidodendrons and sigillarids had now vanished from the earth.\r\nThe uplands were clothed with conifers, like the Araucarian pines\r\nof South America and Australia. Dense forests of tree ferns throve\r\nin moist regions, and canebrakes of horsetails of modern type, but\r\nwith stems reaching four inches in thickness, bordered the lagoons\r\nand marshes. Cycads were exceedingly abundant. These gymnosperms,\r\nrelated to the pines and spruces in structure and fruiting, but\r\npalmlike in their foliage, and uncoiling their long leaves after\r\nthe manner of ferns, culminated in the Jurassic. From the view\r\npoint of the botanist the Mesozoic is the Age of Cycads, and after\r\nthis era they gradually decline to the small number of species now\r\nexisting in tropical latitudes.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 318. A Living Cycad of Australia]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 319. Stem of a Mesozoic Cycad]\r\n\r\n=Plant life of the Cretaceous.= In the Lower Cretaceous the woodlands\r\ncontinued of much the same type as during the Jurassic. The\r\nforerunners now appeared of the modern dicotyls (plants with two seed\r\nleaves), and in the Middle Cretaceous the monocotyledonous group of\r\npalms came in. Palms are so like cycads that we may regard them as the\r\ndescendants of some cycad type.\r\n\r\nIn the _Upper Cretaceous_, cycads become rare. The highest types of\r\nflowering plants gain a complete ascendency, and forests of modern\r\naspect cover the continent from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic\r\nOcean. Among the kinds of forest trees whose remains are found in\r\nthe continental deposits of the Cretaceous are the magnolia, the\r\nmyrtle, the laurel, the fig, the tulip tree, the chestnut, the\r\noak, beech, elm, poplar, willow, birch, and maple. Forests of\r\nEucalyptus grew along the coast of New England, and palms on the\r\nPacific shores of British Columbia. Sequoias of many varieties\r\nranged far into northern Canada. In northern Greenland there were\r\nluxuriant forests of magnolias, figs, and cycads; and a similar\r\nflora has been disinterred from the Cretaceous rocks of Alaska and\r\nSpitzbergen. Evidently the lands within the Arctic Circle enjoyed\r\na warm and genial climate, as they had done during the Paleozoic.\r\nGreenland had the temperature of Cuba and southern Florida, and\r\nthe time was yet far distant when it was to be wrapped in glacier\r\nice.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 320. A Jurassic Long-Tailed Crustacean]\r\n\r\n=Invertebrates.= During the long succession of the ages of the\r\nMesozoic, with their vast geographical changes, there were many\r\nand great changes in organisms. Species were replaced again and\r\nagain by others better fitted to the changing environment. During\r\nthe Lower Cretaceous alone there were no less than six successive\r\nchanges in the faunas which inhabited the limestone-making sea\r\nwhich then covered Texas. We shall disregard these changes for the\r\nmost part in describing the life of the era, and shall confine our\r\nview to some of the most important advances made in the leading\r\ntypes.\r\n\r\nStromatopora have disappeared. Protozoans and sponges are\r\nexceedingly abundant, and all contribute to the making of Mesozoic\r\nstrata. Corals have assumed a more modern type. Sea urchins have\r\nbecome plentiful; crinoids abound until the Cretaceous, where they\r\nbegin their decline to their present humble station.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 321. A Fossil Crab]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 322. Cretaceous Mollusks\r\n\r\n   _A_, Ostrea (oyster); _B_, Exogyra; _C_. Gryphæa]\r\n\r\nTrilobites and eurypterids are gone. Ten-footed crustaceans abound of\r\nthe primitive long-tailed type (represented by the lobster and the\r\ncrayfish), and in the Jurassic there appears the modern short-tailed\r\ntype represented by the crabs. The latter type is higher in\r\norganization and now far more common. In its embryological development\r\nit passes through the long-tailed stage; connecting links in the\r\nMesozoic also indicate that the younger type is the offshoot of the\r\nolder.\r\n\r\nInsects evolve along diverse lines, giving rise to beetles, ants,\r\nbees, and flies.\r\n\r\nBrachiopods have dwindled greatly in the number of their species,\r\nwhile mollusks have correspondingly increased. The great oyster family\r\ndates from here.\r\n\r\nCephalopods are now to have their day. The archaic Orthoceras lingers\r\non into the Triassic and becomes extinct, but a remarkable development\r\nis now at hand for the more highly organized descendants of this\r\nancient line. We have noticed that in the Devonian the sutures of some\r\nof the chambered shells become angled, evolving the Goniatite type.\r\nThe sutures now become lobed and _corrugated_ in _Ceratites_. The process\r\nwas carried still farther, and the sutures were elaborately frilled in\r\nthe great order of the Ammonites. It was in the Jurassic that the\r\nAmmonites reached their height. No fossils are more abundant or\r\ncharacteristic of their age. Great banks of their shells formed beds\r\nof limestone in warm seas the world over.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 323. Ceratites]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 324. An Ammonite\r\n\r\n   A portion of the shell is removed to show frilling of suture]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 325. Slab of Rock covered with\r\n      Ammonites,--a Bit of a Mesozoic Sea Bottom]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 326. Representative Species of Different\r\n      Families of Ammonites]\r\n\r\nThe ammonite stem branched into a most luxuriant variety of forms.\r\nThe typical form was closely coiled like a nautilus. In others the\r\ncoil was more or less open, or even erected into a spiral. Some\r\nwere hook-shaped, and there were members of the order in which the\r\nshell was straight, and yet retained all the internal structures\r\nof its kind. At the end of the Mesozoic the entire tribe of\r\nammonites became extinct.\r\n\r\nThe Belemnite (Greek, _belemnon_, a dart) is a distinctly higher\r\ntype of cephalopod which appeared in the Triassic, became numerous\r\nand varied in the Jurassic and Cretaceous, and died out early in\r\nthe Tertiary. Like the squids and cuttlefish, of which it was the\r\nprototype, it had an internal calcareous shell. This consisted of\r\na chambered and siphuncled cone, whose point was sheathed in a\r\nlong solid guard somewhat like a dart. The animal carried an ink\r\nsac, and no doubt used it as that of the modern cuttlefish is\r\nused,--to darken the water and make easy an escape from foes.\r\nBelemnites have sometimes been sketched with fossil sepia, or\r\nindia ink, from their own ink sacs. In the belemnites and their\r\ndescendants, the squids and cuttlefish, the cephalopods made the\r\nradical change from external to the internal shell. They abandoned\r\nthe defensive system of warfare and boldly took up the offensive.\r\nNo doubt, like their descendants, the belemnites were exceedingly\r\nactive and voracious creatures.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 327. Internal Shell of Belemnite]\r\n\r\n=Fishes and amphibians.= In the Triassic and Jurassic, little\r\nprogress was made among the fishes, and the ganoid was still the\r\nleading type. In the Cretaceous the teleosts, or bony fishes, made\r\ntheir appearance, while ganoids declined toward their present\r\nsubordinate place.\r\n\r\nThe amphibians culminated in the Triassic, some being formidable\r\ncreatures as large as alligators. They were still of the primitive\r\nPaleozoic types. Their pygmy descendants of more modern types are\r\nnot found until later, salamanders appearing first in the\r\nCretaceous, and frogs at the beginning of the Cenozoic.\r\n\r\nNo remains of amphibians have been discovered in the Jurassic. Do\r\nyou infer from this that there were none in existence at that\r\ntime?\r\n\r\n\r\nReptiles of the Mesozoic\r\n\r\nThe great order of Reptiles made its advent in the Permian, culminated\r\nin the Triassic and Jurassic, and began to decline in the Cretaceous.\r\nThe advance from the amphibian to the reptile was a long forward step\r\nin the evolution of the vertebrates. In the reptile the vertebrate\r\nskeleton now became completely ossified. Gills were abandoned and\r\nbreathing was by lungs alone. The development of the individual from\r\nthe egg to maturity was uninterrupted by any metamorphosis, such as\r\nthat of the frog when it passes from the tadpole stage. Yet in\r\nadvancing from the amphibian to the reptile the evolution of the\r\nvertebrate was far from finished. The cold-blooded, clumsy and\r\nsluggish, small-brained and unintelligent reptile is as far inferior\r\nto the higher mammals, whose day was still to come, as it is superior\r\nto the amphibian and the fish.\r\n\r\nThe reptiles of the Permian, the earliest known, were much like\r\nlizards in form of body. Constituting a transition type between the\r\namphibians on the one hand, and both the higher reptiles and the\r\nmammals on the other, they retained the archaic biconcave vertebra of\r\nthe fish and in some cases the persistent notochord, while some of\r\nthem, the theromorphs, possessed characters allying them with mammals.\r\nIn these the skull was remarkably similar to that of the carnivores,\r\nor flesh-eating mammals, and the teeth, unlike the teeth of any later\r\nreptiles, were divisible into incisors, canines, and molars, as are\r\nthe teeth of mammals (Fig. 328).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 328. Skull of a Permian Theromorph]\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the Mesozoic era reptiles were the most highly\r\norganized and powerful of any animals on the earth. New ranges of\r\ncontinental extent were opened to them, food was abundant, the climate\r\nwas congenial, and they now branched into very many diverse types\r\nwhich occupied and ruled all fields,--the land, the air, and the sea.\r\nThe Mesozoic was the Age of Reptiles.\r\n\r\n=The ancestry of surviving reptilian types.= We will consider first\r\nthe evolution of the few reptilian types which have survived to the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nCrocodiles, the highest of existing reptiles, are a very ancient\r\norder, dating back to the lower Jurassic, and traceable to earlier\r\nancestral, generalized forms, from which sprang several other orders\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nTurtles and tortoises are not found until the early Jurassic, when\r\nthey already possessed the peculiar characteristics which set them off\r\nso sharply from other reptiles. They seem to have lived at first in\r\nshallow water and in swamps, and it is not until after the end of the\r\nMesozoic that some of the order became adapted to life on the land.\r\n\r\nThe largest of all known turtles, _Archelon_, whose home was the great\r\ninterior Cretaceous sea, was fully a dozen feet in length and must\r\nhave weighed at least two tons. The skull alone is a yard long.\r\n\r\nLizards and snakes do not appear until after the close of the\r\nMesozoic, although their ancestral lines may be followed back into the\r\nCretaceous.\r\n\r\nWe will now describe some of the highly specialized orders peculiar to\r\nthe Mesozoic.\r\n\r\n=Land reptiles.= The _dinosaurs_ (terrible reptiles) are an extremely\r\nvaried order which were masters of the land from the late Trias until\r\nthe close of the Mesozoic era. Some were far larger than elephants,\r\nsome were as small as cats; some walked on all fours, some were\r\nbipedal; some fed on the luxuriant tropical foliage, and others on the\r\nflesh of weaker reptiles. They may be classed in three divisions,--the\r\n_flesh-eating dinosaurs_, the _reptile-footed dinosaurs_, and the\r\n_beaked dinosaurs_,--the latter two divisions being herbivorous.\r\n\r\nThe _flesh-eating dinosaurs_ are the oldest known division of the\r\norder, and their characteristics are shown in Figure 329. As a class,\r\nreptiles are egg layers (_oviparous_); but some of the flesh-eating\r\ndinosaurs are known to have been _viviparous_, i.e. to have brought\r\nforth their young alive. This group was the longest-lived of any of\r\nthe three, beginning in the Trias and continuing to the close of the\r\nMesozoic era.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 329. Ceratosaurus]\r\n\r\nContrast the small fore limbs, used only for grasping, with the\r\npowerful hind limbs on which the animal stalked about. Some of the\r\nspecies of this group seem to have been able to progress by\r\nleaping in kangaroo fashion. Notice the sharp claws, the ponderous\r\ntail, and the skull set at right angles with the spinal column.\r\nThe limb bones are hollow. The ceratosaurs reached a length of\r\nsome fifteen feet, and were not uncommon in Colorado and the\r\nwestern lands in Jurassic times.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 330. Diplodocus]\r\n\r\nThe _reptile-footed dinosaurs_ (Sauropoda) include some of the\r\nbiggest brutes which ever trod the ground. One of the largest,\r\nwhose remains are found entombed in the Jurassic rocks of Wyoming\r\nand Colorado, is shown in Figure 330.\r\n\r\nNote the five digits on the hind feet, the quadrupedal gait, the\r\nenormous stretch of neck and tail, the small head aligned with the\r\nvertebral column. Diplodocus was fully sixty-five feet long and\r\nmust have weighed about twenty tons. The thigh bones of the\r\nSauropoda are the largest bones which ever grew. That of a genus\r\nallied to the Diplodocus measures six feet and eight inches, and\r\nthe total length of the animal must have been not far from eighty\r\nfeet, the largest land animal known.\r\n\r\nThe Sauropoda became extinct when their haunts along the rivers\r\nand lakes of the western plains of Jurassic times were invaded by\r\nthe Cretaceous interior sea.\r\n\r\nThe _beaked dinosaurs_ (Predentata) were distinguished by a beak\r\nsheathed with horn carried in front of the tooth-set jaw, and\r\nused, we may imagine, in stripping the leaves and twigs of trees\r\nand shrubs. We may notice only two of the most interesting types.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 331. Stegosaurus]\r\n\r\n_Stegosaurus_ (plated reptile) takes its name from the double row of\r\nbony plates arranged along its back. The powerful tail was armed\r\nwith long spines, and the thick skin was defended with irregular\r\nbits of bone implanted in it. The brain of the stegosaur was\r\nsmaller than that of any land vertebrate, while in the sacrum the\r\nnerve canal was enlarged to ten times the capacity of the brain\r\ncavity of the skull. Despite their feeble wits, this well-armored\r\nfamily lived on through millions of years which intervened between\r\ntheir appearance, at the opening of the Jurassic, and the close of\r\nthe Cretaceous, when they became extinct.\r\n\r\nA less stupid brute than the stegosaur was _Triceratops_, the\r\ndinosaur of the three horns,--one horn carried on the nose, and a\r\nmassive pair set over the eyes (Fig. 332). Note the enormous wedge-shaped\r\nskull, with its sharp beak, and the hood behind resembling a\r\nfireman's helmet. Triceratops was fully twenty-five feet long, and\r\nof twice the bulk of an elephant. The family appeared in the Upper\r\nCretaceous and became extinct at its close. Their bones are found\r\nburied in the fresh-water deposits of the time from Colorado to\r\nMontana and eastward to the Dakotas.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 332. Restoration of Triceratops\r\n\r\n   By courtesy of the American Museum of Natural History]\r\n\r\n=Marine reptiles.= In the ocean, reptiles occupied the place now\r\nheld by the aquatic mammals, such as whales and dolphins, and\r\ntheir form and structure were similarly modified to suit their\r\nenvironment. In the Ichthyosaurus (fish reptile), for example, the\r\nbody was fishlike in form, with short neck and large, pointed head\r\n(Fig. 333).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 333. Ichthyosaurus]\r\n\r\nA powerful tail, whose flukes were set vertical, and the lower one\r\nof which was vertebrated, served as propeller, while a large\r\ndorsal fin was developed as a cutwater. The primitive biconcave\r\nvertebræ of the fish and of the early land vertebrates were\r\nretained, and the limbs degenerated into short paddles. The skin\r\nof the ichthyosaur was smooth like that of a whale, and its food\r\nwas largely fish and cephalopods, as the fossil contents of its\r\nstomach prove.\r\n\r\nThese sea monsters disported along the Pacific shore over northern\r\nCalifornia in Triassic times, and the bones of immense members of\r\nthe family occur in the Jurassic strata of Wyoming. Like whales\r\nand seals, the ichthyosaurs were descended from land vertebrates\r\nwhich had become adapted to a marine habitat.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 334. Plesiosaurus]\r\n\r\n_Plesiosaurs_ were another order which ranged throughout the\r\nMesozoic. Descended from small amphibious animals, they later\r\nincluded great marine reptiles, characterized in the typical genus\r\nby long neck, snakelike head, and immense paddles. They swam in\r\nthe Cretaceous interior sea of western North America.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 335. Restoration of a Mosasaur]\r\n\r\n_Mosasaurs_ belong to the same order as do snakes and lizards, and\r\nare an offshoot of the same ancestral line of land reptiles. These\r\nsnakelike creatures--which measured as much as forty-five feet in\r\nlength--abounded in the Cretaceous seas. They had large conical\r\nteeth, and their limbs had become stout paddles.\r\n\r\nThe lower jaw of the mosasaur was jointed; the quadrate bone,\r\nwhich in all reptiles connects the bone of the lower jaw with the\r\nskull, was movable, and as in snakes the lower jaw could be used\r\nin thrusting prey down the throat. The family became extinct at\r\nthe end of the Mesozoic, and left no descendants. One may imitate\r\nthe movement of the lower jaw of the mosasaur by extending the\r\narms, clasping the hands, and bending the elbows.\r\n\r\n=Flying reptiles.= The atmosphere, which had hitherto been tenanted\r\nonly by insects, was first conquered by the vertebrates in the\r\nMesozoic. _Pterosaurs_, winged reptiles, whose whole organism was\r\nadapted for flight through the air, appeared in the Jurassic and\r\npassed off the stage of existence before the end of the\r\nCretaceous. The bones were hollow, as are those of birds. The\r\nsternum, or breastbone, was given a keel for the attachment of the\r\nwing muscles. The fifth finger, prodigiously lengthened, was\r\nturned backward to support a membrane which was attached to the\r\nbody and extended to the base of the tail. The other fingers were\r\nfree, and armed with sharp and delicate claws, as shown in Figures\r\n336 and 337.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 336. Restoration of a Pterosaur]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 337. Skeletons of Pterosaur Ornithostoma,\r\n      _A_, and of the Condor, _B_\r\n\r\n   After Lucas]\r\n\r\nThese \"dragons of the air\" varied greatly in size; some were as\r\nsmall as sparrows, while others surpassed in stretch of wing the\r\nlargest birds of the present day. They may be divided into two\r\ngroups. The earliest group comprises genera with jaws set with\r\nteeth, and with long tails sometimes provided with a rudderlike\r\nexpansion at the end. In their successors of the later group the\r\ntail had become short, and in some of the genera the teeth had\r\ndisappeared. Among the latest of the flying reptiles was\r\n_Ornithostoma_ (bird beak), the largest creature which ever flew,\r\nand whose remains are imbedded in the offshore deposits of the\r\nCretaceous sea which held sway over our western plains.\r\nOrnithostoma's spread of wings was twenty feet. Its bones were a\r\nmarvel of lightness, the entire skeleton, even in its petrified\r\ncondition, not weighing more than five or six pounds. The sharp\r\nbeak, a yard long, was toothless and bird-like, as its name\r\nsuggests.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 338. Archæopteryx]\r\n\r\n=Birds.= The earliest known birds are found in the Jurassic, and\r\nduring the remainder of the Mesozoic they contended with the\r\nflying reptiles for the empire of the air. The first feathered\r\ncreatures were very different from the birds of to-day. Their\r\ncharacteristics prove them an offshoot of the dinosaur line of\r\nreptiles. _Archæopteryx_ (_ancient bird_) (Fig. 338) exhibits a\r\nstrange mingling of bird and reptile. Like birds, it was fledged\r\nwith perfect feathers, at least on wings and tail, but it retained\r\nthe teeth of the reptile, and its long tail was vertebrated,\r\na pair of feathers springing from each joint. Throughout the\r\nJurassic and Cretaceous the remains of birds are far less common\r\nthan those of flying reptiles, and strata representing hundreds of\r\nthousands of years intervene between Archæopteryx and the next\r\nbirds of which we know, whose skeletons occur in the Cretaceous\r\nbeds of western Kansas.\r\n\r\n=Mammals.= So far as the entries upon the geological record show,\r\nmammals made their advent in a very humble way during the Trias.\r\nThese earliest of vertebrates which suckle their young were no\r\nbigger than young kittens, and their strong affinities with the\r\ntheromorphs suggest that their ancestors are to be found among\r\nsome generalized types of that order of reptiles.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 339. Jawbone of a Jurassic Mammal]\r\n\r\nDuring the long ages of the Mesozoic, mammals continued small and\r\nfew, and were completely dominated by the reptiles. Their remains\r\nare exceedingly rare, and consist of minute scattered teeth,--with\r\nan occasional detached jaw,--which prove them to have been flesh\r\nor insect eaters. In the same way their affinities are seen to be\r\nwith the lowest of mammals,--the _monotremes_ and _marsupials_.\r\nThe monotremes,--such as the duckbill mole and the spiny ant-eater\r\nof Australia, reproduce by means of eggs resembling those of\r\nreptiles; the marsupials, such as the opossum and the kangaroo,\r\nbring forth their young alive, but in a very immature condition,\r\nand carry them for some time after birth in the marsupium, a pouch\r\non the ventral side of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE TERTIARY\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Cenozoic era.= The last stages of the Cretaceous are marked by a\r\ndecadence of the reptiles. By the end of that period the reptilian\r\nforms characteristic of the time had become extinct one after another,\r\nleaving to represent the class only the types of reptiles which\r\ncontinue to modern times. The day of the ammonite and the belemnite\r\nalso now drew to a close, and only a few of these cephalopods were\r\nleft to survive the period. It is therefore at the close of the\r\nCretaceous that the line is drawn which marks the end of the Middle\r\nAge of geology and the beginning of the Cenozoic era, the era of\r\nmodern life,--the Age of Mammals.\r\n\r\nIn place of the giant reptiles, mammals now become masters of the\r\nland, appearing first in generalized types which, during the long ages\r\nof the era, gradually evolve to higher forms, more specialized and\r\never more closely resembling the mammals of the present. In the\r\natmosphere the flying dragons of the Mesozoic give place to birds and\r\nbats. In the sea, whales, sharks, and teleost fishes of modern types\r\nrule in the stead of huge swimming reptiles. The lower vertebrates,\r\nthe invertebrates of land and sea, and the plants of field and forest\r\ntake on a modern aspect, and differ little more from those of to-day\r\nthan the plants and animals of different countries now differ from one\r\nanother. From the beginning of the Cenozoic era until now there is a\r\nsteadily increasing number of species of animals and plants which have\r\ncontinued to exist to the present time.\r\n\r\nThe Cenozoic era comprises two divisions,--the _Tertiary_ period and\r\nthe _Quaternary_ period.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of geology the formations of the entire geological\r\nrecord, so far as it was then known, were divided into three\r\ngroups,--the _Primary_, the _Secondary_ (now known as the Mesozoic),\r\nand the _Tertiary_, When the third group was subdivided into two\r\nsystems, the term Tertiary was retained for the first system of the\r\ntwo, while the term _Quaternary_ was used to designate the second.\r\n\r\n=Divisions of the Tertiary.= The formations of the Tertiary are\r\ngrouped in three divisions,--the _Pliocene_ (more recent), the\r\n_Miocene_ (less recent), and the _Eocene_ (the dawn of the recent).\r\nEach of these epochs is long and complex. Their various subdivisions\r\nare distinguished each by its own peculiar organisms, and the changes\r\nof physical geography recorded in their strata. In the rapid view\r\nwhich we are compelled to take we can note only a few of the most\r\nconspicuous events of the period.\r\n\r\n=Physical geography of the Tertiary in eastern North America.= The\r\nTertiary rocks of eastern North America are marine deposits and occupy\r\nthe coastal lowlands of the Atlantic and Gulf states (Fig. 260). In\r\nNew England, Tertiary beds occur on the island of Martha's Vineyard,\r\nbut not on the mainland; hence the shore line here stood somewhat\r\nfarther out than now. From New Jersey southward the earliest Tertiary\r\nsands and clays, still unconsolidated, leave only a narrow strip of\r\nthe edge of the Cretaceous between them and the Triassic and\r\ncrystalline rocks of the Piedmont oldland; hence the Atlantic shore\r\nhere stood farther in than now, and at the beginning of the period the\r\npresent coastal plain was continental delta. A broad belt of Tertiary\r\nsea-laid limestones, sandstones, and shales surrounds the Gulf of\r\nMexico and extends northward up the Mississippi embayment to the mouth\r\nof the Ohio River; hence the Gulf was then larger than at present, and\r\nits waters reached in a broad bay far up the Mississippi valley.\r\n\r\nAlong the Atlantic coast the Mesozoic peneplain may be traced\r\nshoreward to where it disappears from view beneath an unconformable\r\ncover of early Tertiary marine strata. The beginning of the Tertiary\r\nwas therefore marked by a subsidence. The wide erosion surface which\r\nat the close of the Mesozoic lay near sea level where the Appalachian\r\nMountains and their neighboring plateaus and uplands now stand was\r\nlowered gently along its seaward edge beneath the Tertiary Atlantic to\r\nreceive a cover of its sediments.\r\n\r\nAs the period progressed slight oscillations occurred from time to\r\ntime. Strips of coastal plain were added to the land, and as early as\r\nthe close of the Miocene the shore lines of the Atlantic and Gulf\r\nstates had reached well-nigh their present place. Louisiana and\r\nFlorida were the last areas to emerge wholly from the sea,--Florida\r\nbeing formed by a broad transverse upwarp of the continental delta at\r\nthe opening of the Miocene, forming first an island, which afterwards\r\nwas joined to the mainland.\r\n\r\n=The Pacific coast.= Tertiary deposits with marine fossils occur along\r\nthe western foothills of the Sierra Nevadas, and are crumpled among\r\nthe mountain masses of the Coast Ranges; it is hence inferred that the\r\nGreat Valley of California was then a border sea, separated from the\r\nocean by a chain of mountainous islands which were upridged into the\r\nCoast Ranges at a still later time. Tertiary marine strata are spread\r\nover the lower Columbia valley and that of Puget Sound, showing that\r\nthe Pacific came in broadly there.\r\n\r\n=The interior of the western United States.= The closing stages of the\r\nMesozoic were marked, as we have seen, by the upheaval of the Rocky\r\nMountains and other western ranges. The bases of the mountains are now\r\nskirted by widespread Tertiary deposits, which form the highest strata\r\nof the lofty plateaus from the level of whose summits the mountains\r\nrise. Like the recent alluvium of the Great Valley of California (p.\r\n101), these deposits imply low-lying lands when they were laid, and\r\ntherefore at that time the mountains rose from near sea level. But the\r\nheight at which the Tertiary strata now stand--five thousand feet\r\nabove the sea at Denver, and twice that height in the plateaus of\r\nsouthern Utah--proves that the plateaus of which the Tertiary strata\r\nform a part have been uplifted during the Cenozoic. During their\r\nuplift, warping formed extensive basins both east and west of the\r\nRockies, and in these basins stream-swept and lake-laid waste gathered\r\nto depths of hundreds and thousands of feet, as it is accumulating at\r\npresent in the Great Valley of California and on the river plains of\r\nTurkestan (p. 103). The Tertiary river deposits of the High Plains\r\nhave already been described (p. 100). How widespread are these ancient\r\nriver plains and beds of fresh-water lakes may be seen in the map of\r\nFigure 260.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 340. View in the Bad Lands of South Dakota]\r\n\r\n=The Bad Lands.= In several of the western states large areas of\r\nTertiary fresh-water deposits have been dissected to a maze of hills\r\nwhose steep sides are cut with innumerable ravines. The deposits of\r\nthese ancient river plains and lake beds are little cemented and\r\nbecause of the dryness of the climate are unprotected by vegetation;\r\nhence they are easily carved by the wet-weather rills of scanty and\r\ninfrequent rains. These waterless, rugged surfaces were named by the\r\nearly French explorers the _Bad Lands_ because they were found so\r\ndifficult to traverse. The strata of the Bad Lands contain vast\r\nnumbers of the remains of the animals of Tertiary times, and the large\r\namount of barren surface exposed to view makes search for fossils easy\r\nand fruitful. These desolate tracts are therefore frequently visited\r\nby scientific collecting expeditions.\r\n\r\n=Mountain making in the Tertiary.= The Tertiary period included epochs\r\nwhen the earth's crust was singularly unquiet. From time to time on\r\nall the continents subterranean forces gathered head, and the crust\r\nwas bent and broken and upridged in lofty mountains.\r\n\r\nThe Sierra Nevada range was formed, as we have seen, by strata\r\ncrumpling at the end of the Jurassic. But since that remote time the\r\nupfolded mountains had been worn to plains and hilly uplands, the\r\nremnants of whose uplifted erosion surfaces may now be traced along\r\nthe western mountain slopes. Beginning late in the Tertiary, the\r\nregion was again affected by mountain-making movements. A series of\r\ndisplacements along a profound fault on the eastern side tilted the\r\nenormous earth block of the Sierras to the west, lifting its eastern\r\nedge to form the lofty crest and giving to the range a steep eastern\r\nfront and a gentle descent toward the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe Coast Ranges also have had a complex history with many\r\nvicissitudes. The earliest foldings of their strata belong to the\r\nclose of the Jurassic, but it was not until the end of the Miocene\r\nthat the line of mountainous islands and the heavy sediments which had\r\nbeen deposited on their submerged flanks were crushed into a\r\ncontinuous mountain chain. Thick Pliocene beds upon their sides prove\r\nthat they were depressed to near sea level during the later Tertiary.\r\nAt the close of the Pliocene the Coast Ranges rose along with the\r\nupheaval of the Sierra, and their gradual uplift has continued to the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nThe numerous north-south ranges of the Great Basin and the Mount Saint\r\nElias range of Alaska were also uptilted during the Tertiary.\r\n\r\nDuring the Tertiary period many of the loftiest mountains of the\r\nearth--the Alps, the Apennines, the Pyrenees, the Atlas, the Caucasus,\r\nand the Himalayas--received the uplift to which they owe most of their\r\ncolossal bulk and height, as portions of the Tertiary sea beds now\r\nfound high upon their flanks attest. In the Himalayas, Tertiary marine\r\nlimestones occur sixteen thousand five hundred feet above sea level.\r\n\r\n=Volcanic activity in the tertiary.= The vast deformations of the\r\nTertiary were accompanied on a corresponding scale by outpourings of\r\nlava, the outburst of volcanoes, and the intrusion of molten masses\r\nwithin the crust. In the Sierra Nevadas the Miocene river gravels of\r\nthe valleys of the western slope, with their placer deposits of gold,\r\nwere buried beneath streams of lava and beds of tuff (Fig. 258).\r\nVolcanoes broke forth along the Rocky Mountains and on the plateaus of\r\nUtah, New Mexico, and Arizona.\r\n\r\nMount Shasta and the immense volcanic piles of the Cascades date from\r\nthis period. The mountain basin of the Yellowstone Park was filled to\r\na depth of several thousand feet with tuffs and lavas, the oldest\r\ndating as far back as the beginning of the Tertiary. Crandall\r\nvolcano (Fig. 263) was reared in the Miocene and the latest eruptions\r\nof the Park are far more recent.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 341. Lava Plateau with Lava Domes in the\r\n      Distance]\r\n\r\n=The Columbia and Snake River lavas.= Still more important is the\r\nplateau of lava, more than two hundred thousand square miles in area,\r\nextending from the Yellowstone Park to the Cascade Mountains, which\r\nhas been built from Miocene times to the present.\r\n\r\nOver this plateau, which occupies large portions of Idaho, Washington,\r\nand Oregon, and extends into northern California and Nevada, the\r\ncountry rock is basaltic lava. For thousands of square miles the\r\nsurface is a lava plain which meets the boundary mountains as a lake\r\nor sea meets a rugged and deeply indented coast. The floods of molten\r\nrock spread up the mountain valleys for a score of miles and more, the\r\nintervening spurs rising above the lava like long peninsulas, while\r\nhere and there an isolated peak was left to tower above the inundation\r\nlike an island off a submerged shore.\r\n\r\nThe rivers which drain the plateau--the Snake, the Columbia, and their\r\ntributaries--have deeply trenched it, yet their canyons, which reach the\r\ndepth of several thousand feet, have not been worn to the base of the\r\nlava except near the margin and where they cut the summits of mountains\r\ndrowned beneath the flood. Here and there the plateau has been deformed.\r\nIt has been upbent into great folds, and broken into immense blocks of\r\nbedded lava, forming mountain ranges, which run parallel with the\r\nPacific coast line. On the edges of these tilted blocks the thickness of\r\nthe lava is seen to be fully five thousand feet. The plateau has been\r\nbuilt, like that of Iceland (p. 242), of innumerable overlapping sheets\r\nof lava. On the canyon walls they weather back in horizontal terraces\r\nand long talus slopes. One may distinguish each successive flow by its\r\ndense central portion, often jointed with large vertical columns, and\r\nthe upper portion with its mass of confused irregular columns and\r\nscoriaceous surface. The average thickness of the flows seems to be\r\nabout seventy-five feet.\r\n\r\nThe plateau was long in building. Between the layers are found in\r\nplaces old soil beds and forest grounds and the sediments of lakes.\r\nHence the interval between the flows in any locality was sometimes\r\nlong enough for clays to gather in the lakes which filled depressions\r\nin the surface. Again and again the surface of the black basalt was\r\nreddened by oxidation and decayed to soil, and forests had time to\r\ngrow upon it before the succeeding inundation sealed the sediments and\r\nsoils away beneath a sheet of stone. Near the edges of the lava plain,\r\nrivers from the surrounding mountains spread sheets of sand and gravel\r\non the surface of one flow after another. These pervious sands,\r\ninterbedded with the lava, become the aquifers of artesian wells.\r\n\r\nIn places the lavas rest on extensive lake deposits, one thousand feet\r\ndeep, and Miocene in age as their fossils prove. It is to the middle\r\nTertiary, then, that the earliest flows and the largest bulk of the\r\ngreat inundation belong. So ancient are the latest floods in the\r\nColumbia basin that they have weathered to a residual yellow clay from\r\nthirty to sixty feet in depth and marvelously rich in the mineral\r\nsubstances on which plants feed.\r\n\r\nIn the Snake River valley the latest lavas are much younger. Their\r\nsurfaces are so fresh and undecayed that here the effusive eruptions\r\nmay well have continued to within the period of human history. Low\r\nlava domes like those of Iceland mark where last the basalt outwelled\r\nand spread far and wide before it chilled (Fig. 341). In places small\r\nmounds of scoria show that the eruptions were accompanied to a slight\r\ndegree by explosions of steam. So fluid was this superheated lava that\r\nrecent flows have been traced for more than fifty miles.\r\n\r\nThe rocks underlying the Columbia lavas, where exposed to view, are\r\nseen to be cut by numerous great dikes of dense basalt, which mark the\r\nfissures through which the molten rock rose to the surface.\r\n\r\nThe Tertiary included times of widespread and intense volcanic action\r\nin other continents as well as in North America. In Europe,\r\nVesuvius (p. 231) and Etna began their career as submarine volcanoes in\r\nconnection with earth movements which finally lifted Pliocene deposits\r\nin Sicily to their present height,--four thousand feet above the sea.\r\nVolcanoes broke forth in central France and southern Germany, in\r\nHungary and the Carpathians. Innumerable fissures opened in the crust\r\nfrom the north of Ireland and the western islands of Scotland to the\r\nFaroes, Iceland, and even to arctic Greenland; and here great plateaus\r\nwere built of flows of basalt similar to that of the Columbia River.\r\nIn India, at the opening of the Tertiary, there had been an outwelling\r\nof basalt, flooding to a depth of thousands of feet two hundred\r\nthousand square miles of the northwestern part of the peninsula (Fig.\r\n342), and similar inundations of lava occurred where are now the\r\ntable-lands of Abyssinia. From the middle Tertiary on, Asia Minor,\r\nArabia, and Persia were the scenes of volcanic action. In Palestine\r\nthe rise of the uplands of Judea at the close of the Eocene, and the\r\ndownfaulting of the Jordan valley (p. 221) were followed by volcanic\r\noutbursts. In comparison with the middle Tertiary, the present is a\r\ntime of volcanic inactivity and repose.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 342. Map showing the Lava Sheet\r\n      (shaded area) of Western India]\r\n\r\n=Erosion of Tertiary mountains and plateaus.= The mountains and\r\nplateaus built at various times during the Tertiary and at its\r\ncommencement have been profoundly carved by erosive agents. The Sierra\r\nNevada Mountains have been dissected on the western slope by such\r\ncanyons as those of King's River and the Yosemite. Six miles of strata\r\nhave been denuded from parts of the Wasatch Mountains since their rise\r\nat the beginning of the era. From the Colorado plateaus, whose uplift\r\ndates from the same time, there have been stripped off ten thousand\r\nfeet of strata over thousands of square miles, and the colossal canyon\r\nof the Colorado has been cut after this great denudation had been\r\nmostly accomplished.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side of the continent, as we have seen, a broad\r\npeneplain had been developed by the close of the Cretaceous. The\r\nremnants of this old erosion surface are now found upwarped to various\r\nheights in different portions of its area. In southern New England it\r\nnow stands fifteen hundred feet above the sea in western\r\nMassachusetts, declining thence southward and eastward to sea level at\r\nthe coast. In southwestern Virginia it has been lifted to four\r\nthousand feet above the sea. Manifestly this upwarp occurred since the\r\npeneplain was formed; it is later than the Mesozoic, and the vast\r\ndissection which the peneplain has suffered since its uplift must\r\nbelong to the successive cycles of Cenozoic time.\r\n\r\nRevived by the uplift, the streams of the area trenched it as deeply\r\nas its elevation permitted, and reaching grade, opened up wide valleys\r\nand new peneplains in the softer rocks. The Connecticut valley is\r\nTertiary in age, and in the weak Triassic sandstones has been widened\r\nin places to fifteen miles. Dating from the same time are the valleys\r\nof the Hudson, the Susquehanna, the Delaware, the Potomac, and the\r\nShenandoah.\r\n\r\nIn Pennsylvania and the states lying to the south the Mesozoic\r\npeneplain lies along the summits of the mountain ridges. On the\r\nsurface of this ancient plain, Tertiary erosion etched out the\r\nbeautifully regular pattern of the Allegheny mountain ridges and their\r\nintervening valleys. The weaker strata of the long, regular folds were\r\neroded into longitudinal valleys, while the hard Paleozoic sandstones,\r\nsuch as the Medina (p. 335) and the Pocono (p. 350), were left in\r\nrelief as bold mountain walls whose even crests rise to the common\r\nlevel of the ancient plain. From Virginia far into Alabama the great\r\nAppalachian valley was opened to a width in places of fifty miles and\r\nmore, along a belt of intensely folded and faulted strata where once\r\nwas the heart of the Appalachian Mountains. In Figure 70, the summit of\r\nthe Cumberland plateau (ab) marks the level of the Mesozoic peneplain,\r\nwhile the lower erosion levels are Tertiary and Quaternary in age.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 343. Diagram of the Allegheny Mountains,\r\n      Pennsylvania\r\n\r\n   From Davis' Elementary Physical Geography]\r\n\r\n\r\nLife of the Tertiary Period\r\n\r\n=Vegetation and climate.= The highest plants in structure, the\r\n_dicotyls_ (such as our deciduous forest trees) and the _monocotyls_\r\n(represented by the palms), were introduced during the Cretaceous. The\r\nvegetable kingdom reached its culmination before the animal kingdom,\r\nand if the dividing line between the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic were\r\ndrawn according to the progress of plant life, the Cretaceous instead\r\nof the Tertiary would be made the opening period of the modern era.\r\n\r\nThe plants of the Tertiary belonged, for the most part, to genera\r\nnow living; but their distribution was very different from that of\r\nthe flora of to-day. In the earlier Tertiary, palms flourished over\r\nnorthern Europe, and in the northwestern United States grew the\r\nmagnolia and laurel, along with the walnut, oak, and elm. Even in\r\nnorthern Greenland and in Spitzbergen there were lakes covered with\r\nwater lilies and surrounded by forests of maples, poplars, limes, the\r\ncypress of our southern states, and noble sequoias similar to the\r\n\"big trees\" and redwoods of California. A warm climate like that of\r\nthe Mesozoic, therefore, prevailed over North America and Europe,\r\nextending far toward the pole. In the later Tertiary the climate\r\ngradually became cooler. Palms disappeared from Europe, and everywhere\r\nthe aspect of forests and open lands became more like that of to-day.\r\nGrasses became abundant, furnishing a new food for herbivorous\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n=Animal life of the Tertiary.= Little needs to be said of the Tertiary\r\ninvertebrates, so nearly were they like the invertebrates of the\r\npresent. Even in the Eocene, about five per cent of marine shells were\r\nof species still living, and in the Pliocene the proportion had risen\r\nto more than one half.\r\n\r\nFishes were of modern types. Teleosts were now abundant. The ocean\r\nteemed with sharks, some of them being voracious monsters seventy-five\r\nfeet and even more in length, with a gape of jaw of six feet, as\r\nestimated by the size of their enormous sharp-edged teeth.\r\n\r\nSnakes are found for the first time in the early Tertiary. These\r\nlimbless reptiles, evolved by degeneration from lizardlike ancestors,\r\nappeared in nonpoisonous types scarcely to be distinguished from those\r\nof the present day.\r\n\r\n=Mammals of the early Tertiary.= The fossils of continental deposits\r\nof the earliest Eocene show that a marked advance had now been made in\r\nthe evolution of the Mammalia. The higher mammals had appeared, and\r\nhenceforth the lower mammals--the monotremes and the marsupials--are\r\nreduced to a subordinate place.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 344. Phenacodus]\r\n\r\nThese first true mammals were archaic and generalized in structure.\r\nTheir feet were of the primitive type, with five toes of about equal\r\nlength. They were also _plantigrades_,--that is, they touched the\r\nground with the sole of the entire foot from toe to heel. No foot had\r\nyet become adapted to swift running by a decrease in the number of\r\ndigits and by lifting the heel and sole so that only the toes touch\r\nthe ground,--a tread called _digitigrade_. Nor was there yet any foot\r\nlike that of the cats, with sharp retractile claws adapted to seizing\r\nand tearing the prey. The forearm and the lower leg each had still\r\ntwo separate bones (ulna and radius, fibula and tibia), neither pair\r\nhaving been replaced with a single strong bone, as in the leg of the\r\nhorse. The teeth also were primitive in type and of full number. The\r\ncomplex heavy grinders of the horse and elephant, the sharp cutting\r\nteeth of the carnivores, and the cropping teeth of the grass eaters\r\nwere all still to come.\r\n\r\nPhenacodus is a characteristic genus of the early Eocene, whose\r\nspecies varied in size from that of a bulldog to that of an animal a\r\nlittle larger than a sheep. Its feet were primitive, and their five\r\ntoes bore nails intermediate in form between a claw and a hoof. The\r\narchaic type of teeth indicates that the animal was omnivorous in\r\ndiet. A cast of the brain cavity shows that, like its associates of\r\nthe time, its brain was extremely small and nearly smooth, having\r\nlittle more than traces of convolutions.\r\n\r\nThe long ages of the Eocene and the following epochs of the Tertiary\r\nwere times of comparatively rapid evolution among the Mammalia.\r\nThe earliest forms evolved along diverging lines toward the various\r\nspecialized types of hoofed mammals, rodents, carnivores,\r\nproboscidians, the primates, and the other mammalian orders as we know\r\nthem now. We must describe the Tertiary mammals very briefly, tracing\r\nthe lines of descent of only a few of the more familiar mammals of the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n=The horse.= The pedigree of the horse runs back into the early Eocene\r\nthrough many genera and species to a five-toed,[3] short-legged ancestor\r\nlittle bigger than a cat. Its descendants gradually increased in stature\r\nand became better and better adapted to swift running to escape their\r\nfoes. The leg became longer, and only the tip of the toes struck the\r\nground. The middle toe (digit number three), originally the longest of\r\nthe five, steadily enlarged, while the remaining digits dwindled and\r\ndisappeared. The inner digit, corresponding to the great toe and thumb,\r\nwas the first to go. Next number five, the little finger, was also\r\ndropped. By the end of the Eocene a three-toed genus of the horse\r\nfamily had appeared, as large as a sheep. The hoof of digit number\r\nthree now supported most of the weight, but the slender hoofs of\r\ndigits two and four were still serviceable. In the Miocene the stature\r\nof the ancestors of the horse increased to that of a pony. The feet\r\nwere still three-toed, but the side hoofs were now mere dewclaws and\r\nscarcely touched the ground. The evolution of the family was completed\r\nin the Pliocene. The middle toe was enlarged still more, the side toes\r\nwere dropped, and the palm and foot bones which supported them were\r\nreduced to splints.\r\n\r\n   [3] Or, more accurately, with four perfect toes and a\r\n       rudimentary fifth corresponding to the thumb.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 345. Development of Forefoot (A), the\r\n      Forearm (B), the Molar (C), of the Horse Family]\r\n\r\nWhile these changes were in progress the radius and ulna of the fore\r\nlimb became consolidated to a single bone; and in the hind limb the\r\nfibula dwindled to a splint, while the tibia was correspondingly\r\nenlarged. The molars, also gradually lengthened, and became more and\r\nmore complex on their grinding surface; the neck became longer; the\r\nbrain steadily increased in size and its convolutions became more\r\nabundant. The evolution of the horse has made for greater fleetness\r\nand intelligence.\r\n\r\n=The rhinoceros and tapir.= These animals, which are grouped with the\r\nhorse among the _odd-toed_ (perissodactyl) mammals, are now verging\r\ntoward extinction. In the rhinoceros, evolution seems to have taken\r\nthe opposite course from that of the horse. As the animal increased in\r\nsize it became more clumsy, its limbs became shorter and more massive,\r\nand, perhaps because of its great weight, the number of digits were\r\nnot reduced below the number three. Like other large herbivores, the\r\nrhinoceros, too slow to escape its enemies by flight, learned to\r\nwithstand them. It developed as its means of defense a nasal horn.\r\n\r\nPeculiar offshoots of the line appeared at various times in the\r\nTertiary. A rhinoceros, semiaquatic in habits, with curved tusks,\r\nresembling in aspect the hippopotamus, lived along the water courses\r\nof the plains east of the Rockies, and its bones are now found by the\r\nthousands in the Miocene of Kansas. Another developed along a line\r\nparallel to that of the horse, and herds of these light-limbed and\r\nswift-footed running rhinoceroses ranged the Great Plains from the\r\nDakotas southward.\r\n\r\nThe tapirs are an ancient family which has changed but little since it\r\nseparated from the other perissodactyl stocks in the early Tertiary.\r\nAt present, tapirs are found only in South America and southern\r\nAsia,--a remarkable distribution which we could not explain were it\r\nnot that the geological record shows that during Tertiary times tapirs\r\nranged throughout the northern hemisphere, making their way to South\r\nAmerica late in that period. During the Pleistocene they became\r\nextinct over all the intervening lands between the widely separated\r\nregions where now they live. The geographic distribution of animals,\r\nas well as their relationships and origins, can be understood only\r\nthrough a study of their geological history.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 346. A Tertiary Mastodon]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 347. Head of Dinothere]\r\n\r\n=The proboscidians.= This unique order of hoofed mammals, of which the\r\nelephant is the sole survivor, has been traced back to the close of\r\nthe Eocene. In the middle and later Tertiary it was represented by\r\nhuge creatures so nearly akin to the mastodons of the Pleistocene that\r\nthey are often included in that genus. The Tertiary _Mastodon_ was\r\nfurnished with a long, flexible proboscis, and armed with two pairs of\r\nlong, straight ivory tusks, the pair of the lower jaw being smaller.\r\n\r\nThe _Dinothere_ was a curious offshoot of the line, which developed in\r\nthe Miocene in Europe. In this immense proboscidian, whose skull was\r\nthree feet long, the upper pair of tusks had disappeared, and those of\r\nthe lower jaw were bent down with a backward curve in walrus fashion.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 348. Crown of Mastodon Tooth]\r\n\r\nIn the true _elephants_, which do not appear until near the close of\r\nthe Tertiary, the lower jaw loses its tusks and the grinding teeth\r\nbecome exceedingly complex in structure. The grinding teeth of the\r\nmastodon had long roots and low crowns crossed by four or five peaked\r\nenameled ridges. In the teeth of the true elephants the crown has\r\nbecome deep, and the ridges of enamel have changed to numerous\r\nupright, platelike folds, their interspaces filled with cement. The\r\ntwo genera--Mastodon and Elephant--are connected by species whose\r\nteeth are intermediate in pattern. The proboscidians culminated in the\r\nPliocene, when some of the giant elephants reached a height of\r\nfourteen feet.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 349. Tooth of an Extinct Elephant, the Mammoth]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 350. Evolution of the Artiodactyl Foot,\r\n      Illustrated by Existing Families\r\n\r\n   _A_, pig; _B_, roebuck; _C_, sheep; _D_, camel]\r\n\r\n=The artiodactyls= comprise the hoofed Mammalia which have an even\r\nnumber of toes, such as cattle, sheep, and swine. Like the\r\nperissodactyls, they are descended from the primitive five-toed\r\nplantigrade mammals of the lowest Eocene. In their evolution, digit\r\nnumber one was first dropped, and the middle pair became larger and\r\nmore massive, while the side digits, numbers two and five, became\r\nshorter, weaker, and less serviceable. The _four-toed artiodactyls_\r\nculminated in the Tertiary; at present they are represented only by\r\nthe hippopotamus and the hog. Along the main line of the evolution of\r\nthe artiodactyls the side toes, digits two and five, disappeared,\r\nleaving as proof that they once existed the corresponding bones of\r\npalm and sole as splints. The _two-toed artiodactyls_, such as the\r\ncamels, deer, cattle, and sheep, are now the leading types of the\r\nherbivores.\r\n\r\n_Swine and peccaries_ are two branches of a common stock, the first\r\ndeveloping in the Old World and the second in the New. In the Miocene\r\na noticeable offshoot of the line was a gigantic piglike brute, a root\r\neater, with a skull a yard in length, whose remains are now found in\r\nColorado and South Dakota.\r\n\r\n=Camels and llamas.= The line of camels and llamas developed in North\r\nAmerica, where the successive changes from an early Eocene ancestor,\r\nno larger than a rabbit, are traced step by step to the present forms,\r\nas clearly as is the evolution of the horse. In the late Miocene some\r\nof the ancestral forms migrated to the Old World by way of a land\r\nconnection where Bering Strait now is, and there gave rise to the\r\ncamels and dromedaries. Others migrated into South America, which had\r\nnow been connected with our own continent, and these developed into\r\nthe llamas and guanacos, while those of the race which remained in\r\nNorth America became extinct during the Pleistocene.\r\n\r\nSome peculiar branches of the camel stem appeared in North America. In\r\nthe Pliocene arose a llama with the long neck and limbs of a giraffe,\r\nwhose food was cropped from the leaves and branches of trees. Far more\r\ngeneralized in structure was the _Oreodon_, an animal related to the\r\ncamels, but with distinct affinities also with other lines, such as\r\nthose of the hog and deer. These curious creatures were much like the\r\npeccary in appearance, except for their long tails. In the middle\r\nEocene they roamed in vast herds from Oregon to Kansas and Nebraska.\r\n\r\n=The ruminants.= This division of the artiodactyls includes antelopes,\r\ndeer, oxen, bison, sheep, and goats,--all of which belong to a common\r\nstock which took its rise in Europe in the upper Eocene from ancestral\r\nforms akin to those of the camels. In the Miocene the evolution of the\r\ntwo-toed artiodactyl foot was well-nigh completed. Bonelike growths\r\nappeared on the head, and the two groups of the ruminants became\r\nspecialized,--the deer with bony antlers, shed and renewed each year,\r\nand the ruminants with hollow horns, whose two bony knobs upon the\r\nskull are covered with permanent, pointed, horny sheaths.\r\n\r\nThe ruminants evolved in the Old World, and it was not until the later\r\nMiocene that the ancestors of the antelope and of some deer found\r\ntheir way to North America. Mountain sheep and goats, the bison and\r\nmost of the deer, did not arrive until after the close of the\r\nTertiary, and sheep and oxen were introduced by man.\r\n\r\nThe hoofed mammals of the Tertiary included many offshoots from the\r\nmain lines which we have traced. Among them were a number of genera of\r\nclumsy, ponderous brutes, some almost elephantine in their bulk.\r\n\r\n=The carnivores.= The ancestral lines of the families of the flesh\r\neaters--such as the cats (lions, tigers, etc.), the bears, the hyenas,\r\nand the dogs (including wolves and foxes)--converge in the creodonts\r\nof the early Eocene,--an order so generalized that it had affinities\r\nnot only with the carnivores but also with the insect eaters, the\r\nmarsupials, and the hoofed mammals as well. From these primitive flesh\r\neaters, with small and simple brains, numerous small teeth, and\r\nplantigrade tread, the different families of the carnivores of the\r\npresent have slowly evolved.\r\n\r\n=Dogs and bears.= The dog family diverged from the creodonts late in\r\nthe Eocene, and divided into two branches, one of which evolved the\r\nwolves and the other the foxes. An offshoot gave rise to the family\r\nof the bears, and so closely do these two families, now wide apart,\r\napproach as we trace them back in Tertiary times that the Amphicyon,\r\na genus doglike in its teeth and bearlike in other structures, is\r\nreferred by some to the dog and by others to the bear family. The\r\nwell-known plantigrade tread of bears is a primitive characteristic\r\nwhich has survived from their creodont ancestry.\r\n\r\n=Cats.= The family of the cats, the most highly specialized of all the\r\ncarnivores, divided in the Tertiary into two main branches. One, the\r\nsaber-tooth tigers (Fig. 351), which takes its name from their long,\r\nsaberlike, sharp-edged upper canine teeth, evolved a succession of\r\ngenera and species, among them some of the most destructive beasts of\r\nprey which ever scourged the earth. They were masters of the entire\r\nnorthern hemisphere during the middle Tertiary, but in Europe during\r\nthe Pliocene they declined, from unknown causes, and gave place to the\r\nother branch of cats,--which includes the lions, tigers, and leopards.\r\nIn the Americas the saber-tooth tigers long survived the epoch.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 351. Saber-Tooth Tiger]\r\n\r\n=Marine mammals.= The carnivorous mammals of the sea--whales, seals,\r\nwalruses, etc.--seem to have been derived from some of the creodonts\r\nof the early Tertiary by adaptation to aquatic life. Whales evolved\r\nfrom some land ancestry at a very early date in the Tertiary; in the\r\nmarine deposits of the Eocene are found the bones of the Zeuglodon, a\r\nwhalelike creature seventy feet in length.\r\n\r\n=Primates.= This order, which includes lemurs, monkeys, apes, and man,\r\nseems to have sprung from a creodont or insectivorous ancestry in\r\nthe lower Eocene. Lemur-like types, with small, smooth brains, were\r\nabundant in the United States in the early Tertiary, but no primates\r\nhave been found here in the middle Tertiary and later strata. In\r\nEurope true monkeys were introduced in the Miocene, and were abundant\r\nuntil the close of the Tertiary, when they were driven from the\r\ncontinent by the increasing cold.\r\n\r\n=Advance of the mammalia during the tertiary.= During the several\r\nmillions of years comprised in Tertiary time the mammals evolved from\r\nthe lowly, simple types which tenanted the earth at the beginning of\r\nthe period, into the many kinds of highly specialized mammals of the\r\nPleistocene and the present, each with the various structures of the\r\nbody adapted to its own peculiar mode of life. The swift feet of the\r\nhorse, the horns of cattle and the antlers of the deer, the lion's\r\nclaws and teeth, the long incisors of the beaver, the proboscis of the\r\nelephant, were all developed in Tertiary times. In especial the brain\r\nof the Tertiary mammals constantly grew larger relatively to the\r\nsize of body, and the higher portion of the brain--the cerebral\r\nlobes--increased in size in comparison with the cerebellum. Some\r\nof the hoofed mammals now have a brain eight or ten times the size\r\nof that of their early Tertiary predecessors of equal bulk. Nor\r\ncan we doubt that along with the increasing size of brain went a\r\ncorresponding increase in the keenness of the senses, in activity\r\nand vigor, and in intelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE QUATERNARY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last period of geological history, the Quaternary, may be said to\r\nhave begun when all, or nearly all, living species of mollusks and\r\nmost of the existing mammals had appeared.\r\n\r\nIt is divided into two great epochs. The first, the _Pleistocene_ or\r\n_Glacial epoch_, is marked off from the Tertiary by the occupation of\r\nthe northern parts of North America and Europe by vast ice sheets; the\r\nsecond, the _Recent epoch_, began with the disappearance of the ice\r\nsheets from these continents, and merges into the present time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pleistocene Epoch\r\n\r\nWe now come to an episode of unusual interest, so different was it\r\nfrom most of the preceding epochs and from the present, and so largely\r\nhas it influenced the conditions of man's life.\r\n\r\nThe records of the Glacial epoch are so plain and full that\r\nwe are compelled to believe what otherwise would seem almost\r\nincredible,--that following the mild climate of the Tertiary came a\r\nsuccession of ages when ice fields, like that of Greenland, shrouded\r\nthe northern parts of North America and Europe and extended far into\r\ntemperate latitudes.\r\n\r\n=The drift.= Our studies of glaciers have prepared us to decipher and\r\ninterpret the history of the Glacial epoch, as it is recorded in the\r\nsurface deposits known as the drift. Over most of Canada and the\r\nnorthern states this familiar formation is exposed to view in nearly\r\nall cuttings which pass below the surface soil. The drift includes two\r\ndistinct classes of deposits,--the unstratified drift laid down by\r\nglacier ice, and the stratified drift spread by glacier waters.\r\n\r\nThe materials of the drift are in any given place in part unlike the\r\nrock on which it rests. They cannot be derived from the underlying\r\nrock by weathering, but have been brought from elsewhere. Thus where a\r\nregion is underlain by sedimentary rocks, as is the drift-covered area\r\nfrom the Hudson River to the Missouri, the drift contains not only\r\nfragments of limestone, sandstone, and shale of local derivation, but\r\nalso pebbles of many igneous and metamorphic rocks, such as granites,\r\ngneisses, schists, dike rocks, quartzites, and the quartz of mineral\r\nveins, whose nearest source is the Archean area of Canada and the\r\nstates of our northern border. The drift received its name when it was\r\nsupposed that the formation had been drifted by floods and icebergs\r\nfrom outside sources,--a theory long since abandoned.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 352. Stratified Drift overlaying\r\n      Unstratified Drift, Massachusetts]\r\n\r\nThe distribution also of the drift points clearly to its peculiar\r\norigin. Within the limits of the glaciated area it covers the country\r\nwithout regard to the relief, mantling with its debris not only\r\nlowlands and valleys but also highlands and mountain slopes.\r\n\r\nThe boundary of the drift is equally independent of the relief of\r\nthe land, crossing hills and plains impartially, unlike water-laid\r\ndeposits, whose margins, unless subsequently deformed, are horizontal.\r\nThe boundary of the drift is strikingly lobate also, bending outward\r\nin broad, convex curves, where there are no natural barriers in the\r\ntopography of the country to set it such a limit. Under these\r\nconditions such a lobate margin cannot belong to deposits of rivers,\r\nlakes, or ocean, but is precisely that which would mark the edge of a\r\ncontinental glacier which deployed in broad tongues of ice.\r\n\r\n=The rock surface underlying the drift.= Over much of its area the\r\ndrift rests on firm, fresh rock, showing that both the preglacial\r\nmantle of residual waste and the partially decomposed and broken rock\r\nbeneath it have been swept away. The underlying rock, especially if\r\nmassive, hard, and of a fine grain, has often been ground down to a\r\nsmooth surface and rubbed to a polish as perfect as that seen on the\r\nrock beside an Alpine glacier where the ice has recently melted back.\r\nFrequently it has been worn to the smooth, rounded hummocks known as\r\nroches moutonnées, and even rocky hills have been thus smoothed to\r\nflowing outlines like roches moutonnées on a gigantic scale. The rock\r\npavement beneath the drift is also marked by long, straight, parallel\r\nscorings, varying in size from deep grooves to fine striae as delicate\r\nas the hair lines cut by an engraver's needle. Where the rock is soft\r\nor closely jointed it is often shattered to a depth of several feet\r\nbeneath the drift, while stony clay has been thrust in among the\r\nfragments into which the rock is broken.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of these glaciated surfaces we cannot doubt that the\r\narea of the drift has been overridden by vast sheets of ice which, in\r\ntheir steady flow, rasped and scored the rock bed beneath by means of\r\nthe stones with which their basal layers were inset, and in places\r\nplucked and shattered it.\r\n\r\n=Till.= The unstratified portion of the drift consists chiefly of\r\nsheets of dense, stony clay called till, which clearly are the ground\r\nmoraines of ancient continental glaciers. Till is an unsorted mixture\r\nof materials of all sizes, from fine clay and sand, gravel, pebbles,\r\nand cobblestones, to large bowlders. The stones of the till are of\r\nmany kinds, some having been plucked from the bed rock of the locality\r\nwhere they are found, and others having been brought from outside and\r\noften distant places. Land ice is the only agent known which can\r\nspread unstratified material in such extensive sheets.\r\n\r\nThe _fine material_ of the till comes from two different sources. In\r\npart it is derived from old residual clays, which in the making had\r\nbeen leached of the lime and other soluble ingredients of the rock\r\nfrom which they weathered. In part it consists of sound rock ground\r\nfine; a drop of acid on fresh, clayey till often proves by brisk\r\neffervescence that the till contains much undecayed limestone flour.\r\nThe ice sheet, therefore, both scraped up the mantle of long-weathered\r\nwaste which covered the country before its coming, and also ground\r\nheavily upon the sound rock underneath, and crushed and wore to rock\r\nflour the fragments which it carried.\r\n\r\nThe color of unweathered till depends on that of the materials of\r\nwhich it is composed. Where red sandstones have contributed largely to\r\nits making, as over the Triassic sandstones of the eastern states and\r\nthe Algonkian sandstones about Lake Superior, the drift is reddish.\r\nWhen derived in part from coaly shales, as over many outcrops of the\r\nPennsylvanian, it may when moist be almost black. Fresh till is\r\nnormally a dull gray or bluish, so largely is it made up of the\r\ngrindings of unoxidized rocks of these common colors.\r\n\r\nExcept where composed chiefly of sand or coarser stuff, unweathered\r\ntill is often exceedingly dense. Can you suggest by what means it has\r\nbeen thus compacted? Did the ice fields of the Glacial epoch bear\r\nheavy surface moraines like the medial and lateral moraines of valley\r\nglaciers? Where was the greater part of the load of these ice fields\r\ncarried, judging from what you know of the glaciers of Greenland?\r\n\r\n=Bowlders of the drift.= The pebbles and bowlders of the drift are in\r\npart stream gravels, bowlders of weathering, and other coarse rock\r\nwaste picked up from the surface of the country by the advancing ice,\r\nand in part are fragments plucked from ledges of sound rock after the\r\nmantle of waste had been removed. Many of the stones of the till are\r\ndressed as only glacier ice can do; their sharp edges have been\r\nblunted and their sides faceted and scored.\r\n\r\nWe may easily find all stages of this process represented among the\r\npebbles of the till. Some are little worn, even on their edges; some\r\nare planed and scored on one side only; while some in their long\r\njourney have been ground down to many facets and have lost much of\r\ntheir original bulk. Evidently the ice played fast and loose with a\r\nstone carried in its basal layers, now holding it fast and rubbing it\r\nagainst the rock beneath, now loosening its grasp and allowing the\r\nstone to turn.\r\n\r\nBowlders of the drift are sometimes found on higher ground than their\r\nparent ledges. Thus bowlders have been left on the sides of Mount\r\nKatahdin, Maine, which were plucked from limestone ledges twelve miles\r\ndistant and three thousand feet lower than their resting place. In\r\nother cases stones have been carried over mountain ranges, as in\r\nVermont, where pebbles of Burlington red sandstone were dragged over\r\nthe Green Mountains, three thousand feet in height, and left in the\r\nConnecticut valley sixty miles away. No other geological agent than\r\nglacier ice could do this work.\r\n\r\nThe bowlders of the drift are often large. Bowlders ten and twenty\r\nfeet in diameter are not uncommon, and some are known whose diameter\r\nexceeds fifty feet. As a rule the average size of bowlders decreases\r\nwith increasing distance from their sources. Why?\r\n\r\n=Till plains.= The surface of the drift, where left in its initial\r\nstate, also displays clear proof of its glacial origin. Over large\r\nareas it is spread in level plains of till, perhaps bowlder-dotted,\r\nsimilar to the plains of stony clay left in Spitzbergen by the recent\r\nretreat of some of the glaciers of that island. In places the\r\nunstratified drift is heaped in hills of various kinds, which we will\r\nnow describe.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 354. Map of a portion of a Drumlin Area near\r\n      Oswego, New York]\r\n\r\n=Drumlins.= Drumlins are smooth, rounded hills composed of till,\r\nelliptical in base, and having their longer axes parallel to the\r\nmovement of the ice as shown by glacial scorings. They crowd certain\r\ndistricts in central New York and in southern Wisconsin, where they\r\nmay be counted by the thousands. Among the numerous drumlins about\r\nBoston is historic Bunker Hill.\r\n\r\nDrumlins are made of ground moraine. They were accumulated and given\r\nshape beneath the overriding ice, much as are sand bars in a river, or\r\nin some instances were carved, like roches moutonnées, by an ice sheet\r\nout of the till left by an earlier ice invasion.\r\n\r\n=Terminal moraines.= The glaciated area is crossed by belts of\r\nthickened drift, often a mile or two, and sometimes even ten miles\r\nand more, in breadth, which lie transverse to the movement of the ice\r\nand clearly are the terminal moraines of ancient ice sheets, marking\r\neither the limit of their farthest advance or pauses in their general\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 355. Terminal Moraine, Staten Island]\r\n\r\nThe surface of these moraines is a jumble of elevations and\r\ndepressions, which vary from low, gentle swells and shallow sags to\r\nsharp hills, a hundred feet or so in height, and deep, steep-sided\r\nhollows. Such tumultuous hills and hummocks, set with depressions of\r\nall shapes, which usually are without outlet and are often occupied by\r\nmarshes, ponds, and lakes, surely cannot be the work of running water.\r\nThe hills are heaps of drift, lodged beneath the ice edge or piled\r\nalong its front. The basins were left among the tangle of morainic\r\nknolls and ridges (Fig. 105) as the margin of the ice moved back and\r\nforth. Some bowl-shaped basins were made by the melting of a mass of\r\nice left behind by the retreating glacier and buried in its debris.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 356. Esker, New York]\r\n\r\n=The stratified drift.= Like modern glaciers the ice sheets of the\r\nPleistocene were ever being converted into water about their margins.\r\nTheir limits on the land were the lines where their onward flow was\r\njust balanced by melting and evaporation. On the surface of the ice\r\nalong the marginal zone, rivulets no doubt flowed in summer, and found\r\ntheir way through crevasses to the interior of the glacier or to\r\nthe ground. Subglacial streams, like those of the Malaspina glacier,\r\nissued from tunnels in the ice, and water ran along the melting ice\r\nfront as it is seen to do about the glacier tongues of Greenland. All\r\nthese glacier waters flowed away down the chief drainage channels in\r\nswollen rivers loaded with glacial waste.\r\n\r\nIt is not unexpected therefore that there are found, over all the\r\ncountry where the melting ice retreated, deposits made of the same\r\nmaterials as the till, but sorted and stratified by running water.\r\nSome of these were deposited behind the ice front in ice-walled\r\nchannels, some at the edge of the glaciers by issuing streams, and\r\nothers were spread to long distances in front of the ice edge by\r\nglacial waters as they flowed away.\r\n\r\n_Eskers_ are narrow, winding ridges of stratified sand and gravel\r\nwhose general course lies parallel with the movement of the glacier.\r\nThese ridges, though evidently laid by running water, do not follow\r\nlines of continuous descent, but may be found to cross river valleys\r\nand ascend their sides. Hence the streams by which eskers were laid\r\ndid not flow unconfined upon the surface of the ground. We may infer\r\nthat eskers were deposited in the tunnels and ice-walled gorges of\r\nglacial streams before they issued from the ice front.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 357. Kames, New York]\r\n\r\n_Kames_ are sand and gravel knolls, associated for the most part\r\nwith terminal moraines, and heaped by glacial waters along the\r\nmargin of the ice.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 358. Diagram Illustrating the Formation of\r\n      Kame Terraces\r\n\r\n   _i_, glacier ice; _t_, _t_, terraces]\r\n\r\n_Kame terraces_ are hummocky embankments of stratified drift sometimes\r\nfound in rugged regions along the sides of valleys. In these valleys\r\nlong tongues of glacier ice lay slowly melting. Glacial waters took\r\ntheir way between the edges of the glaciers and the hillside, and here\r\ndeposited sand and gravel in rude terraces.\r\n\r\n_Outwash plains_ are plains of sand and gravel which frequently border\r\nterminal moraines on their outward face, and were spread evidently by\r\noutwash from the melting ice. Outwash plains are sometimes pitted by\r\nbowl-shaped basins where ice blocks were left buried in the sand by\r\nthe retreating glacier.\r\n\r\n_Valley trains_ are deposits of stratified drift with which river\r\nvalleys have been aggraded. Valleys leading outward from the ice front\r\nwere flooded by glacial waters and were filled often to great depths\r\nwith trains of stream-swept drift. Since the disappearance of the ice\r\nthese glacial flood plains have been dissected by the shrunken rivers\r\nof recent times and left on either side the valley in high terraces.\r\nValley trains head in morainic plains, and their material grows finer\r\ndown valley and coarser toward their sources. Their gradient is\r\ncommonly greater than that of the present rivers.\r\n\r\n=The extent of the drift.= The extent of the drift of North America\r\nand its southern limits are best seen in Figure 359. Its area is\r\nreckoned at about four million square miles. The ice fields which once\r\ncovered so much of our continent were all together ten times as large\r\nas the inland ice of Greenland, and about equal to the enormous ice\r\ncap which now covers the antartic regions.\r\n\r\nThe ice field of Europe was much smaller, measuring about seven\r\nhundred and seventy thousand square miles.\r\n\r\n=Centers of dispersion.= The direction of the movement of the ice is\r\nrecorded plainly in the scorings of the rock surface, in the shapes of\r\nglaciated hills, in the axes of drumlins and eskers, and in trains of\r\nbowlders, when the ledges from which they were plucked can be\r\ndiscovered. In these ways it has been proved that in North America\r\nthere were three centers where ice gathered to the greatest depth,\r\nand from which it flowed in all directions outward. There were thus\r\nthree vast ice fields,--one the _Cordilleran_, which lay upon the\r\nCordilleras of British America; one the _Keewatin_, which flowed\r\nout from the province of Keewatin, west of Hudson Bay; and one the\r\n_Labrador_ ice field, whose center of dispersion was on the highlands\r\nof the peninsula of Labrador. As shown in Figure 359, the western ice\r\nfield extended but a short way beyond the eastern foothills of the\r\nRocky Mountains, where perhaps it met the far-traveled ice from the\r\ngreat central field. The Keewatin and the Labrador ice fields flowed\r\nfarthest toward the south, and in the Mississippi valley the one\r\nreached the mouth of the Missouri and the other nearly to the mouth of\r\nthe Ohio. In Minnesota and Wisconsin and northward they merged in one\r\nvast field.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 359. Hypothetical Map of the Pleistocene Ice Sheets\r\n      of North America\r\n\r\n   From Salisbury's _Glacial Geology of New Jersey_]\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the ice was so great that it buried the highest\r\nmountains of eastern North America, as is proved by the transported\r\nbowlders which have been found upon their summits. If the land then\r\nstood at its present height above sea level, and if the average slope\r\nof the ice were no more than ten feet to the mile,--a slope so gentle\r\nthat the eye could not detect it and less than half the slope of the\r\ninterior of the inland ice of Greenland,--the ice plateaus about\r\nHudson Bay must have reached a thickness of at least ten thousand\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nIn Europe the Scandinavian plateau was the chief center of dispersion.\r\nAt the time of greatest glaciation a continuous field of ice extended\r\nfrom the Ural Mountains to the Atlantic, where, off the coasts of\r\nNorway and the British Isles, it met the sea in an unbroken ice wall.\r\nOn the south it reached to southern England, Belgium, and central\r\nGermany, and deployed on the eastern plains in wide lobes over Poland\r\nand central Russia (Fig. 360).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 360. Hypothetical Map of the Pleistocene\r\n      Ice Sheet of Europe]\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Alps supported giant glaciers many times the size\r\nof the surviving glaciers of to-day, and a piedmont glacier covered\r\nthe plains of northern Switzerland.\r\n\r\n=The thickness of the drift.= The drift is far from uniform in\r\nthickness. It is comparatively thin and scanty over the Laurentian\r\nhighlands and the rugged regions of New England, while from southern\r\nNew York and Ontario westward over the Mississippi valley, and on the\r\ngreat western plains of Canada, it exceeds an average of one hundred\r\nfeet over wide areas, and in places has five and six times that\r\nthickness. It was to this marginal belt that the ice sheets brought\r\ntheir loads, while northwards, nearer the centers of dispersion,\r\nerosion was excessive and deposition slight.\r\n\r\n=Successive ice invasions and their drift sheets.= Recent studies of\r\nthe drift prove that it does not consist of one indivisible formation,\r\nbut includes a number of distinct drift sheets, each with its own\r\npeculiar features. The Pleistocene epoch consisted, therefore, of\r\nseveral glacial stages,--during each of which the ice advanced far\r\nsouthward,--together with the intervening interglacial stages when,\r\nunder a milder climate, the ice melted back toward its sources or\r\nwholly disappeared.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 361. Diagram illustrating Criteria by which\r\n      Different Drift Sheets are distinguished]\r\n\r\nThe evidences of such interglacial stages, and the means by which the\r\ndifferent drift sheets are told apart, are illustrated in Figure 361.\r\nHere the country from N to S is wholly covered by drift, but the drift\r\nfrom N to _m_ is so unlike that from _m_ to S that we may believe it\r\nthe product of a distinct ice invasion and deposited during another\r\nand far later glacial stage. The former drift is very young, for its\r\ndrainage is as yet immature, and there are many lakes and marshes\r\nupon its surface; the latter is far older, for its surface has been\r\nthoroughly dissected by its streams. The former is but slightly\r\nweathered, while the latter is so old that it is deeply reddened by\r\noxidation and is leached of its soluble ingredients such as lime.\r\nThe younger drift is bordered by a distinct terminal moraine, while\r\nthe margin of the older drift is not thus marked. Moreover, the two\r\ndrift sheets are somewhat unlike in composition, and the different\r\nproportion of pebbles of the various kinds of rocks which they contain\r\nshows that their respective glaciers followed different tracks and\r\ngathered their loads from different regions. Again, in places beneath\r\nthe younger drift there is found the buried land surface of an older\r\ndrift with old soils, forest grounds, and vegetable deposits,\r\ncontaining the remains of animals and plants, which tell of the\r\nclimate of the interglacial stage in which they lived.\r\n\r\nBy such differences as these the following drift sheets have been made\r\nout in America, and similar subdivisions have been recognized in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n    5 The Wisconsin formation\r\n    4 The Iowan formation\r\n    3 The Illinoian formation\r\n    2 The Kansan formation\r\n    1 The pre-Kansan or Jerseyan formation\r\n\r\nIn New Jersey and Pennsylvania the edge of a deeply weathered and\r\neroded drift sheet, the Jerseyan, extends beyond the limits of a much\r\nyounger overlying drift. It may be the equivalent of a deep-buried\r\nbasal drift sheet found in the Mississippi valley beneath the Kansan\r\nand parted from it by peat, old soil, and gravel beds.\r\n\r\nThe two succeeding stages mark the greatest snowfall of the Glacial\r\nepoch. In Kansan times the Keewatin ice field slowly grew southward\r\nuntil it reached fifteen hundred miles from its center of dispersion\r\nand extended from the Arctic Ocean to northeastern Kansas. In the\r\nIllinoian stage the Labrador ice field stretched from Hudson Straits\r\nnearly to the Ohio River in Illinois. In the Iowan and the Wisconsin,\r\nthe closing stages of the Glacial epoch, the readvancing ice fields\r\nfell far short of their former limits in the Mississippi valley, but\r\nin the eastern states the Labrador ice field during Wisconsin times\r\noverrode for the most part all earlier deposits, and, covering New\r\nEngland, probably met the ocean in a continuous wall of ice which set\r\nits bergs afloat from Massachusetts to northern Labrador.\r\n\r\nWe select for detailed description the Kansan and the Wisconsin\r\nformations as representatives, the one of the older and the other of\r\nthe younger drift sheets.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 362. Photograph of Relief Map of the United\r\n      States at the Time of the Wisconsin Ice Invasion\r\n\r\n   By the courtesy of E. E. Howell, Washington, D.C.]\r\n\r\n=The Kansan formation.= The Kansan drift consists for the most part of\r\na sheet of clayey till carrying smaller bowlders than the later drift.\r\nFew traces of drumlins, kames, or terminal moraines are found upon the\r\nKansan drift, and where thick enough to mask the preexisting surface,\r\nit seems to have been spread originally in level plains of till.\r\n\r\nThe initial Kansan plain has been worn by running water until there\r\nare now left only isolated patches and the narrow strips and crests of\r\nthe divides, which still rise to the ancient level. The valleys of the\r\nlarger streams have been opened wide. Their well-developed tributaries\r\nhave carved nearly the entire plain to valley slopes (Figs. 50 B, and\r\n59). The lakes and marshes which once marked the infancy of the region\r\nhave long since been effaced. The drift is also deeply weathered. The\r\ntill, originally blue in color, has been yellowed by oxidation to\r\na depth of ten and twenty feet and even more, and its surface is\r\nsometimes rusted to terra-cotta red. To a somewhat less depth it has\r\nbeen leached of its lime and other soluble ingredients. In the\r\nweathered zone its pebbles, especially where the till is loose in\r\ntexture, are sometimes so rotted that granites may be crumbled with\r\nthe fingers. The Kansan drift is therefore old.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 363. Plain of Wisconsin Drift, Iowa]\r\n\r\n=The Wisconsin formation.= The Wisconsin drift sheet is but little\r\nweathered and eroded, and therefore is extremely young. Oxidation has\r\neffected it but slightly, and lime and other soluble plant foods\r\nremain undissolved even at the grass roots. Its river systems are\r\nstill in their infancy (Fig. 50, A). Swamps and peat bogs are abundant\r\non its undrained surface, and to this drift sheet belong the lake\r\nlands of our northern states and of the Laurentian peneplain of\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nThe lake basins of the Wisconsin drift are of several different\r\nclasses. Many are shallow sags in the ground moraine. Still more\r\nnumerous are the lakes set in hollows among the hills of the terminal\r\nmoraines; such as the thousands of lakelets of eastern Massachusetts.\r\nIndeed, the terminal moraines of the Wisconsin drift may often be\r\nroughly traced on maps by means of belts of lakes and ponds. Some\r\nlakes are due to the blockade of ancient valleys by morainic débris,\r\nand this class includes many of the lakes of the Adirondacks, the\r\nmountain regions of New England, and the Laurentian area. Still other\r\nlakes rest in rock basins scooped out by glaciers. In many cases lakes\r\nare due to more than one cause, as where preglacial valleys have both\r\nbeen basined by the ice and blockaded by its moraines. The Finger\r\nlakes of New York, for example, occupy such glacial troughs.\r\n\r\nMassive _terminal moraines_, which mark the farthest limits to which\r\nthe Wisconsin ice advanced, have been traced from Cape Cod and\r\nthe islands south of New England, across the Appalachians and the\r\nMississippi valley, through the Dakotas, and far to the north over the\r\nplains of British America. Where the ice halted for a time in its\r\ngeneral retreat, it left _recessional moraines_, as this variety of\r\nthe terminal moraine is called. The moraines of the Wisconsin drift\r\nlie upon the country like great festoons, each series of concentric\r\nloops marking the utmost advance of broad lobes of the ice margin and\r\nthe various pauses in their recession.\r\n\r\nBehind the terminal moraines lie wide till plains, in places studded\r\nthickly with drumlins, or ridged with an occasional esker. Great\r\noutwash plains of sand and gravel lie in front of the moraine belts,\r\nand long valley trains of coarse gravels tell of the swift and\r\npowerful rivers of the time.\r\n\r\n=The loess of the Mississippi valley.= A yellow earth, quite like\r\nthe loess of China, is laid broadly as a surface deposit over\r\nthe Mississippi valley from eastern Nebraska to Ohio outside the\r\nboundaries of the Iowan and the Wisconsin drift. Much of the loess was\r\ndeposited in Iowan times. It is younger than the earlier drift sheets,\r\nfor it overlies their weathered and eroded surfaces. It thickens to\r\nthe Iowan drift border, but is not found upon that drift. It is older\r\nthan the Wisconsin, for in many places it passes underneath the\r\nWisconsin terminal moraines. In part the loess seems to have been\r\nwashed from glacial waste and spread in sluggish glacial waters, and\r\nin part to have been distributed by the wind from plains of aggrading\r\nglacial streams.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 364. Bank of Loess, Iowa]\r\n\r\n=The effects of the ice invasions on rivers.= The repeated ice\r\ninvasions of the Pleistocene profoundly disarranged the drainage\r\nsystems of our northern states. In some regions the ancient valleys\r\nwere completely filled with drift. On the withdrawal of the ice the\r\nstreams were compelled to find their way, as best they could, over a\r\nfresh land surface, where we now find them flowing on the drift in\r\nyoung, narrow channels. But hundreds of feet below the ground the\r\nwell driller and the prospector for coal and oil discover deep,\r\nwide, buried valleys cut in rock,--the channels of preglacial and\r\ninterglacial streams. In places the ancient valleys were filled with\r\ndrift to a depth of a hundred feet, and sometimes even to a depth of\r\nfour hundred and five hundred feet. In such valleys, rivers now flow\r\nhigh above their ancient beds of rock on floors of valley drift. Many\r\nof the valleys of our present rivers are but patchworks of preglacial,\r\ninterglacial, and postglacial courses (Fig. 366). Here the river winds\r\nalong an ancient valley with gently sloping sides and a wide alluvial\r\nfloor perhaps a mile or so in width, and there it enters a young,\r\nrock-walled gorge, whose rocky bed may be crossed by ledges over which\r\nthe river plunges in waterfalls and rapids.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 365. Preglacial Drainage, Upper Ohio Valley\r\n\r\n   After Chamberlain and Leverett]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 366. A Patchwork Valley\r\n\r\n   _a_ and _a´_, ancient courses still occupied by the river;\r\n   _b_, postglacial gorge; _c_, ancient course now filled with drift]\r\n\r\nIn such cases it is possible that the river was pushed to one side\r\nof its former valley by a lobe of ice, and compelled to cut a new\r\nchannel in the adjacent uplands. A section of the valley may have been\r\nblockaded with morainic waste, and the lake formed behind the barrier\r\nmay have found outlet over the country to one side of the ancient\r\ndrift-filled valley. In some instances it would seem that during the\r\nwaning of the ice sheets, glacial streams, while confined within walls\r\nof stagnant ice, cut down through the ice and incised their channels\r\non the underlying country, in some cases being let down on old river\r\ncourses, and in other cases excavating gorges in adjacent uplands.\r\n\r\n=Pleistocene lakes.= Temporary lakes were formed wherever the ice\r\nfront dammed the natural drainage of the region. Some, held in the\r\nminor valleys crossed by ice lobes, were small, and no doubt many were\r\ntoo short-lived to leave lasting records. Others, long held against\r\nthe northward sloping country by the retreating ice edge, left in\r\ntheir beaches their clayey beds, and their outlet channels permanent\r\nevidences of their area and depth. Some of these glacial lakes are\r\nthus known to have been larger than any present lake.\r\n\r\nLake Agassiz, named in honor of the author of the theory of\r\ncontinental glaciation, is supposed to have been held by the united\r\nfront of the Keewatin and the Labrador ice fields as they finally\r\nretreated down the valley of the Red River of the North and the\r\ndrainage basin of Lake Winnipeg. From first to last Lake Agassiz\r\ncovered a hundred and ten thousand square miles in Manitoba and the\r\nadjacent parts of Minnesota and North Dakota,--an area larger than all\r\nthe Great Lakes combined. It discharged its waters across the divide\r\nwhich held it on the south, and thus excavated the valley of the\r\nMinnesota River. The lake bed--a plain of till--was spread smooth and\r\nlevel as a floor with lacustrine silts. Since Lake Agassiz vanished\r\nwith the melting back of the ice beyond the outlet by the Nelson River\r\ninto Hudson Bay, there has gathered on its floor a deep humus, rich in\r\nthe nitrogenous elements so needful for the growth of plants, and it\r\nis to this soil that the region owes its well-known fertility.\r\n\r\n=The Great Lakes.= The basins of the Great Lakes are broad preglacial\r\nriver valleys, warped by movements of the crust still in progress,\r\nenlarged by the erosive action of lobes of the continental ice sheets,\r\nand blockaded by their drift. The complicated glacial and postglacial\r\nhistory of the lakes is recorded in old strand lines which have been\r\ntraced at various heights about them, showing their areas and the\r\nlevels at which their waters stood at different times.\r\n\r\nWith the retreat of the lobate Wisconsin ice sheet toward the north\r\nand east, the southern and western ends of the basins of the Great\r\nLakes were uncovered first; and here, between the receding ice front\r\nand the slopes of land which faced it, lakes gathered which increased\r\nconstantly in size.\r\n\r\nThe lake which thus came to occupy the western end of the Lake\r\nSuperior basin discharged over the divide at Duluth down the St. Croix\r\nRiver, as an old outlet channel proves; that which held the southern\r\nend of the basin of Lake Michigan sent its overflow across the divide\r\nat Chicago via the Illinois River to the Mississippi; the lake which\r\ncovered the lowlands about the western end of Lake Erie discharged its\r\nwaters at Fort Wayne into the Wabash River.\r\n\r\nThe ice still blocked the Mohawk and St. Lawrence valleys on the east,\r\nwhile on the west it had retreated far to the north. The lakes become\r\nconfluent in wide expanses of water, whose depths and margins, as\r\nshown by their old lake beaches, varied at different times with the\r\nposition of the confining ice and with warpings of the land. These\r\nvast water bodies, which at one or more periods were greater than all\r\nthe Great Lakes combined, discharged at various times across the\r\ndivide at Chicago, near Syracuse, New York, down the Mohawk valley,\r\nand by a channel from Georgian Bay into the Ottawa River. Last of all\r\nthe present outlet by the St. Lawrence was established.\r\n\r\nThe beaches of the glacial lakes just mentioned are now far from\r\nhorizontal. That of the lake which occupied the Ontario basin has an\r\nelevation of three hundred and sixty-two feet above tide at the west\r\nand of six hundred and seventy-five feet at the northeast, proving\r\nhere a differential movement of the land since glacial times amounting\r\nto more than three hundred feet. The beaches which mark the successive\r\nheights of these glacial lakes are not parallel; hence the warping\r\nbegan before the Glacial epoch closed. We have already seen that the\r\ncanting of the region is still in progress.\r\n\r\n=The Champlain subsidence.= As the Glacial epoch approached its end,\r\nand the Labrador ice field melted back for the last time to near its\r\nsource, the land on which the ice had lain in eastern North America\r\nwas so depressed that the sea now spread far and wide up the St.\r\nLawrence valley. It joined with Lake Ontario, and extending down the\r\nChamplain and Hudson valleys, made an island of New England and the\r\nmaritime provinces of Canada.\r\n\r\nThe proofs of this subsidence are found in old sea beaches and\r\nsea-laid clays resting on Wisconsin till. At Montreal such terraces\r\nare found six hundred and twenty feet above sea level, and along Lake\r\nChamplain--where the skeleton of a whale was once found among them--at\r\nfrom five hundred to four hundred feet. The heavy delta which the\r\nMohawk River built at its mouth in this arm of the sea now stands\r\nsomething more than three hundred feet above sea level. The clays of\r\nthe Champlain subsidence pass under water near the mouth of the\r\nHudson, and in northern New Jersey they occur two hundred feet below\r\ntide. In these elevations we have measures of the warping of the\r\nregion since glacial times.\r\n\r\n=The western United States in glacial times.= The western United\r\nStates was not covered during the Pleistocene by any general ice\r\nsheet, but all the high ranges were capped with permanent snow and\r\nnourished valley glaciers, often many times the size of the existing\r\nglaciers of the Alps. In almost every valley of the Sierras and the\r\nRockies the records of these vanished ice streams may be found in\r\ncirques, glacial troughs, roches moutonnées, and morainic deposits.\r\n\r\nIt was during the Glacial epoch that Lakes Bonneville and Lahontan\r\nwere established in the Great Basin, whose climate must then have been\r\nmuch more moist than now.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 367. A Valley in the Driftless Area]\r\n\r\n=The driftless area.= In the upper Mississippi valley there is an\r\narea of about ten thousand square miles in southwestern Wisconsin\r\nand the adjacent parts of Iowa and Minnesota, which escaped the ice\r\ninvasions. The rocks are covered with residual clays, the product of\r\nlong preglacial weathering. The region is an ancient peneplain,\r\nuplifted and dissected in late Tertiary times, with mature valleys\r\nwhose gentle gradients are unbroken by waterfalls and rapids. Thus the\r\ndriftless area is in strong contrast with the immature drift topography\r\nabout it, where lakes and waterfalls are common. It is a bit of\r\npreglacial landscape, showing the condition of the entire region before\r\nthe Glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nThe driftless area lay to one side of the main track of both the\r\nKeewatin and the Labrador ice fields, and at the north it was\r\nprotected by the upland south of Lake Superior, which weakened and\r\nretarded the movement of the ice.\r\n\r\nSouth of the driftless area the Mississippi valley was invaded at\r\ndifferent times by ice sheets from the west,--the Kansan and the\r\nIowan,--and again by the Illinoian ice sheet from the east. Again and\r\nagain the Mississippi River was pushed to one side or the other of its\r\npath. The ancient channel which it held along the Illinoian ice front\r\nhas been traced through southeastern Iowa for many miles.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 368. Cross Section of a Valley in Eastern Iowa\r\n\r\n   _a_, country rock; _b_, Kansan till; _c_, loess; _t_, terrace\r\n   of reddish sands and decayed pebbles above reach of present\r\n   stream; _s_, stream; _fp_, flood plain of _s_. What is the age\r\n   of rock-cut valley and of the alluvium which partially fills\r\n   it, compared with that of the Kansan till? with that of the\r\n   loess? Give the complete history recorded in the section.]\r\n\r\n=Benefits of glaciation.= Like the driftless area, the preglacial\r\nsurface over which the ice advanced seems to have been well dissected\r\nafter the late Tertiary uplifts, and to have been carved in many\r\nplaces to steep valley slopes and rugged hills. The retreating ice\r\nsheets, which left smooth plains and gently rolling country over the\r\nwide belt where glacial deposition exceeded glacial erosion, have made\r\ntravel and transportation easier than they otherwise would have been.\r\n\r\nThe preglacial subsoils were residual clays and sands, composed of the\r\ninsoluble elements of the country rock of the locality, with some\r\nminglings of its soluble parts still undissolved. The glacial subsoils\r\nare made of rocks of many kinds, still undecayed and largely ground to\r\npowder. They thus contain an inexhaustible store of the mineral foods\r\nof plants, and in a form made easily ready for plant use.\r\n\r\nOn the preglacial hillsides the humus layer must have been\r\ncomparatively thin, while the broad glacial plains have gathered deep\r\nblack soils, rich in carbon and nitrogen taken from the atmosphere.\r\nTo these soils and subsoils a large part of the wealth and prosperity\r\nof the glaciated regions of our country must be attributed.\r\n\r\nThe ice invasions have also added very largely to the water power of\r\nthe country. The rivers which in preglacial times were flowing over\r\ngraded courses for the most part, were pushed from their old valleys\r\nand set to flow on higher levels, where they have developed waterfalls\r\nand rapids. This power will probably be fully utilized long before the\r\ncoal beds of the country are exhausted, and will become one of the\r\nchief sources of the national wealth.\r\n\r\n=The Recent epoch.= The deposits laid since glacial times graduate\r\ninto those now forming along the ocean shores, on lake beds, and in\r\nriver valleys. Slow and comparatively slight changes, such as the\r\nwarpings of the region of the Great Lakes, have brought about the\r\ngeographical conditions of the present. The physical history of the\r\nRecent epoch needs here no special mention.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Life of the Quaternary\r\n\r\nDuring the entire Quaternary, invertebrates and plants suffered little\r\nchange in species,--so slowly are these ancient and comparatively\r\nsimple organisms modified. The Mammalia, on the other hand, have\r\nchanged much since the beginning of Quaternary time: the various\r\nspecies of the present have been evolved, and some lines have become\r\nextinct. These highly organized vertebrates are evidently less stable\r\nthan are lower types of animals, and respond more rapidly to changes\r\nin the environment.\r\n\r\n=Pleistocene mammals.= In the Pleistocene the Mammalia reached their\r\nculmination both in size and in variety of forms, and were superior\r\nin both these respects to the mammals of to-day. In Pleistocene times\r\nin North America there were several species of bison,--one whose\r\nwidespreading horns were ten feet from tip to tip,--a gigantic moose\r\nelk, a giant rodent (Castoroides) five feet long, several species of\r\nmusk oxen, several species of horses,--more akin, however, to zebras\r\nthan to the modern horse,--a huge lion, several saber-tooth tigers,\r\nimmense edentates of several genera, and largest of all the mastodon\r\nand mammoth.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 369. Megatherium]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 370. Glyptodon]\r\n\r\nThe largest of the edentates was the Megatherium, a. clumsy ground\r\nsloth bigger than a rhinoceros. The bones of the Megatherium are\r\nextraordinarily massive,--the thigh bone being thrice as thick as\r\nthat of an elephant,--and the animal seems to have been well able to\r\nget its living by overthrowing trees and stripping off their leaves.\r\nThe Glyptodon was a mailed edentate, eight feet long, resembling the\r\nlittle armadillo. These edentates survived from Tertiary times, and in\r\nthe warmer stages of the Pleistocene ranged north as far as Ohio and\r\nOregon.\r\n\r\nThe great proboscidians of the Glacial epoch were about the size of\r\nmodern elephants, and somewhat smaller than their ancestral species in\r\nthe Pliocene. The _Mastodon_ ranged over all North America south of\r\nHudson Bay, but had become extinct in the Old World at the end of the\r\nTertiary. The elephants were represented by the _Mammoth_, which\r\nroamed in immense herds from our middle states to Alaska, and from\r\nArctic Asia to the Mediterranean and Atlantic.\r\n\r\nIt is an oft-told story how about a century ago, near the Lena River\r\nin Siberia, there was found the body of a mammoth which had been\r\nsafely preserved in ice for thousands of years, how the flesh was\r\neaten by dogs and bears, and how the eyes and hoofs and portions of\r\nthe hide were taken with the skeleton to St. Petersburg. Since then\r\nseveral other carcasses of the mammoth, similarly preserved in ice,\r\nhave been found in the same region,--one as recently as 1901. We know\r\nfrom these remains that the animal was clothed in a coat of long,\r\ncoarse hair, with thick brown fur beneath.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 371. Skull of Musk Ox, from Pleistocene\r\n      Deposits, Iowa]\r\n\r\n=The distribution of animals and plants.= The distribution of species\r\nin the Glacial epoch was far different from that of the present. In\r\nthe glacial stages arctic species ranged south into what are now\r\ntemperate latitudes. The walrus throve along the shores of Virginia\r\nand the musk ox grazed in Iowa and Kentucky. In Europe the reindeer\r\nand arctic fox reached the Pyrenees. During the Champlain depression\r\narctic shells lived along the shore of the arm of the sea which\r\ncovered the St. Lawrence valley. In interglacial times of milder\r\nclimate the arctic fauna-flora retreated, and their places were taken\r\nby plants and animals from the south. Peccaries, now found in Texas,\r\nranged into Michigan and New York, while great sloths from South\r\nAmerica reached the middle states. Interglacial beds at Toronto,\r\nCanada, contain remains of forests of maple, elm, and papaw, with\r\nmollusks now living in the Mississippi basin.\r\n\r\nWhat changes in the forests of your region would be brought about, and\r\nin what way, if the climate should very gradually grow colder? What\r\nchanges if it should grow warmer?\r\n\r\nOn the Alps and the highest summits of the White Mountains of New\r\nEngland are found colonies of arctic species of plants and insects.\r\nHow did they come to be thus separated from their home beyond the\r\narctic circle by a thousand miles and more of temperate climate\r\nimpossible to cross?\r\n\r\n=Man.= Along with the remains of the characteristic animals of the\r\ntime which are now extinct there have been found in deposits of the\r\nGlacial epoch in the Old World relics of Pleistocene _Man_, his bones,\r\nand articles of his manufacture. In Europe, where they have best been\r\nstudied, human relics occur chiefly in peat bogs, in loess, in caverns\r\nwhere man made his home, and in high river terraces sometimes eighty\r\nand a hundred feet above the present flood plains of the streams.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the development of early man, we should know\r\nthat prehistoric peoples are ranked according to the materials of\r\nwhich their tools were made and the skill shown in their manufacture.\r\nThere are thus four well-marked stages of human culture preceding the\r\nwritten annals of history:\r\n\r\n    4 The Iron stage.\r\n    3 The Bronze stage.\r\n    2 The Neolithic (recent stone) stage.\r\n    1 The Paleolithic (ancient stone) stage.\r\n\r\nIn the Neolithic stage the use of the metals had not yet been learned,\r\nbut tools of stone were carefully shaped and polished. To this stage\r\nthe North American Indian belonged at the time of the discovery of the\r\ncontinent. In the Paleolithic stage, stone implements were chipped to\r\nrude shapes and left unpolished. This, the lowest state of human\r\nculture, has been outgrown by nearly every savage tribe now on earth.\r\nA still earlier stage may once have existed, when man had not learned\r\nso much as to shape his weapons to his needs, but used chance pebbles\r\nand rock splinters in their natural forms; of such a stage, however,\r\nwe have no evidence.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 372. Paleolithic Implement from Great Britain]\r\n\r\n=Paleolithic man in Europe.= It was to the Paleolithic stage that the\r\nearliest men belonged whose relics are found in Europe. They had\r\nlearned to knock off two-edged flakes from flint pebbles, and to work\r\nthem into simple weapons. The great discovery had been made that fire\r\ncould be kindled and made use of, as the charcoal and the stones\r\ndiscolored by heat of their ancient hearths attest. Caves and shelters\r\nbeneath overhanging cliffs were their homes or camping places.\r\nPaleolithic man was a savage of the lowest type, who lived by hunting\r\nthe wild beasts of the time.\r\n\r\nSkeletons found in certain caves in Belgium and France represent\r\nperhaps the earliest race yet found in Europe. These short,\r\nbroad-shouldered men, muscular, with bent knees and stooping gait,\r\nlow-browed and small of brain, were of little intelligence and yet\r\ntruly human.\r\n\r\nThe remains of Pleistocene man are naturally found either in caverns,\r\nwhere they escaped destruction by the ice sheets, or in deposits\r\noutside the glaciated area. In both cases it is extremely difficult,\r\nor quite impossible, to assign the remains to definite glacial or\r\ninterglacial times. Their relative age is best told by the fauna with\r\nwhich they are associated. Thus the oldest relics of man are found\r\nwith the animals of the late Tertiary or early Quaternary, such as a\r\nspecies of hippopotamus and an elephant more ancient than the mammoth.\r\nLater in age are the remains found along with the mammoth, cave bear\r\nand cave hyena, and other animals of glacial time which are now\r\nextinct; while more recent still are those associated with the\r\nreindeer, which in the last ice invasion roamed widely with the\r\nmammoth over central Europe.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 373. Paleolithic Sketch on Ivory of the Mammoth]\r\n\r\n=The caves of southern France.= These contain the fullest records of\r\nthe race, much like the Eskimos in bodily frame, which lived in\r\nwestern Europe at the time of the mammoth and the reindeer. The floors\r\nof these caves are covered with a layer of bone fragments, the remains\r\nof many meals, and here are found also various articles of handicraft.\r\nIn this way we know that the savages who made these caves their homes\r\nfished with harpoons of bone, and hunted with spears and darts tipped\r\nwith flint and horn. The larger bones are split for the extraction of\r\nthe marrow. Among such fragments no split human bones are found; this\r\npeople, therefore, were not cannibals. Bone needles imply the art of\r\nsewing, and therefore the use of clothing, made no doubt of skins;\r\nwhile various ornaments, such as necklaces of shells, show how ancient\r\nis the love of personal adornment. Pottery was not yet invented. There\r\nis no sign of agriculture. No animals had yet been domesticated; not\r\neven man's earliest friend, the dog. Certain implements, perhaps used\r\nas the insignia of office, suggest a rude tribal organization and the\r\nbeginnings of the state. The remains of funeral feasts in front of\r\ncaverns used as tombs point to a religion and the belief in a life\r\nbeyond the grave. In the caverns of southern France are found also the\r\nbeginnings of the arts of painting and of sculpture. With surprising\r\nskill these Paleolithic men sketched on bits of ivory the mammoth with\r\nhis long hair and huge curved tusks, frescoed their cavern walls with\r\npictures of the bison and other animals, and carved reindeer on their\r\ndagger heads.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 374. Restoration of Head of Pithecanthropus\r\n      erectus]\r\n\r\n=Early man on other continents.= Paleolithic flints curiously like\r\nthose of western Europe are found also in many regions of the Old\r\nWorld,--in India, Egypt, and Asia Minor,--beneath the earliest\r\nvestiges of the civilization of those ancient seats, and sometimes\r\nassociated with the fauna of the Glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nIn Java there were found in 1891, in strata early Quaternary or late\r\nPliocene in age, parts of a skeleton of lower grade, if not of greater\r\nantiquity, than any human remains now known. _Pithecanthropus erectus_,\r\nas the creature has been named, walked erect, as its thigh bone shows,\r\nbut the skull and teeth indicate a close affinity with the ape.\r\n\r\nIn North America there have been reported many finds of human relics\r\nin valley trains, loess, old river gravels buried beneath lava flows,\r\nand other deposits of supposed glacial age; but in the opinion of some\r\ngeologists sufficient proof of the existence of man in America in\r\nglacial times has not as yet been found.\r\n\r\nThese finds in North America have been discredited for various\r\nreasons. Some were not made by scientific men accustomed to the\r\nclosest scrutiny of every detail. Some were reported after a number of\r\nyears, when the circumstances might not be accurately remembered;\r\nwhile in a number of instances it seems possible that the relics might\r\nhave been worked into glacial deposits by natural causes from the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nMan, we may believe, witnessed the great ice fields of Europe, if not\r\nof America, and perhaps appeared on earth under the genial climate\r\nof preglacial times. Nothing has yet been found of the line of man's\r\nsupposed descent from the primates of the early Tertiary, with the\r\npossible exception of the Java remains just mentioned. The structures\r\nof man's body show that he is not descended from any of the existing\r\ngenera of apes. And although he may not have been exempt from the law\r\nof evolution,--that method of creation which has made all life on\r\nearth akin,--yet his appearance was an event which in importance\r\nranks with the advent of life upon the planet, and marks a new\r\nmanifestation of creative energy upon a higher plane. There now\r\nappeared intelligence, reason, a moral nature, and a capacity for\r\nself-directed progress such as had never been before on earth.\r\n\r\n=The Recent epoch.= The Glacial epoch ends with the melting of the\r\nice sheets of North America and Europe, and the replacement of the\r\nPleistocene mammalian fauna by present species. How gradually the one\r\nepoch shades into the other is seen in the fact that the glaciers\r\nwhich still linger in Norway and Alaska are the lineal descendants or\r\nthe renewed appearances of the ice fields of glacial times.\r\n\r\nOur science cannot foretell whether all traces of the Great Ice Age\r\nare to disappear, and the earth is to enjoy again the genial climate\r\nof the Tertiary, or whether the present is an interglacial epoch and\r\nthe northern lands are comparatively soon again to be wrapped in ice.\r\n\r\n=Neolithic man.= The wild Paleolithic men vanished from Europe with\r\nthe wild beasts which they hunted, and their place was taken by\r\ntribes, perhaps from Asia, of a higher culture. The remains of\r\nNeolithic man are found, much as are those of the North American\r\nIndians, upon or near the surface, in burial mounds, in shell heaps\r\n(the refuse heaps of their settlements), in peat bogs, caves, recent\r\nflood-plain deposits, and in the beds of lakes near shore where they\r\nsometimes built their dwellings upon piles.\r\n\r\nThe successive stages in European culture are well displayed in the\r\npeat bogs of Denmark. The lowest layers contain the polished _stone_\r\nimplements of Neolithic man, along with remains of the _Scotch fir_.\r\nAbove are _oak_ trunks with implements of _bronze_, while the higher\r\nlayers hold _iron_ weapons and the remains of a _beech_ forest.\r\n\r\nNeolithic man in Europe had learned to make pottery, to spin and weave\r\nlinen, to hew timbers and build boats, and to grow wheat and barley.\r\nThe dog, horse, ox, sheep, goat, and hog had been domesticated, and,\r\nas these species are not known to have existed before in Europe, it is\r\na fair inference that they were brought by man from another continent\r\nof the Old World. Neolithic man knew nothing of the art of extracting\r\nthe metals from their ores, nor had he a written language.\r\n\r\nThe Neolithic stage of culture passes by insensible gradations into\r\nthat of the age of bronze, and thus into the Recent epoch.\r\n\r\nIn the Recent epoch the progress of man in language, in social\r\norganization, in the arts of life, in morals and religion, has left\r\nample records which are for other sciences than ours to read; here,\r\ntherefore, geology gives place to archæology and history.\r\n\r\nOur brief study of the outlines of geology has given us, it is hoped,\r\nsome great and lasting good. To conceive a past so different from the\r\npresent has stimulated the imagination, and to follow the inferences\r\nby which the conclusions of our science have been reached has\r\nexercised one of the noblest faculties of the mind,--the reason. We\r\nhave learned to look on nature in new ways: every landscape, every\r\npebble now has a meaning and tells something of its origin and\r\nhistory, while plants and animals have a closer interest since we have\r\ntraced the long lines of their descent. The narrow horizons of human\r\nlife have been broken through, and we have caught glimpses of that\r\nimmeasurable reach of time in which nebulae and suns and planets run\r\ntheir courses. Moreover, we have learned something of that orderly and\r\nworld-embracing progress by which the once uninhabitable globe has\r\ncome to be man's well-appointed home, and life appearing in the\r\nlowliest forms has steadily developed higher and still higher types.\r\nSeeing this process enter human history and lift our race continually\r\nto loftier levels, we find reason to believe that the onward, upward\r\nmovement of the geological past is the manifestation of the same wise\r\nPower which makes for righteousness and good and that this unceasing\r\npurpose will still lead on to nobler ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Aa, lava, 241\r\n  Acadian coal field, 354\r\n  Accretion hypothesis, 304\r\n  Acidic rocks, 249\r\n  Adelsberg grotto, 47\r\n  Adirondacks, 309,

Cloth. viii + 401 pages + 6 color charts + 16 pages of maps.\r\nIllustrated. List price, $1.25.\r\n\r\nThe \"Elementary Physical Geography\" is a new book by Professor W. M.\r\nDavis, the first authority in the United States in the field of physical\r\ngeography. It retains the characteristic features of the author's\r\nearlier work, \"Physical Geography,\" but is much less difficult and is\r\nadmirably adapted for use with younger pupils.\r\n\r\nThe plan of this volume, like that of its predecessor, is to give the\r\nproblems of physical geography a rational treatment. The object of this\r\nmethod is not simply to explain physiographic facts, but to increase the\r\nappreciation of the facts themselves by associating them with their\r\ncauses and their consequences. This relation is not presented merely\r\nas an afterthought in a detached chapter at the end of the book; it\r\naccompanies the presentation of the facts themselves.\r\n\r\nThe chapter on the Atmosphere has been considerably expanded, and an\r\nentirely new chapter has been added on the Distribution of Plants,\r\nAnimals, and Man, considered from a physiographic standpoint. The\r\nquestions at the end of each chapter, prepared by an experienced\r\nhigh-school teacher, will be found most useful in class-room work with\r\nthis book.\r\n\r\nEspecially notable are the illustrations, which include nearly two\r\nhundred splendid woodcuts, five pages of charts in color, and nineteen\r\nfull-page half-tone plates from rare photographs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Nation, July 3, 1902: Taken all in all, this seems the most\r\nsatisfactory elementary text-book in physical geography yet published.\r\nCertainly in its treatment of the land it has not been surpassed unless,\r\nperhaps, by the author's larger work [\"Physical Geography\"].\r\n\r\n=================================================================\r\n\r\nGINN & COMPANY Publishers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=================================================================\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHIC INFLUENCES IN AMERICAN HISTORY\r\n\r\nBy ALBERT PERRY BRIGHAM\r\n\r\nProfessor of Geology in Colgate University. 12mo.

List price, $1.25; mailing price, $1.40\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn this new book Professor Brigham has presented vividly and clearly\r\nthose physiographic features of America which have been important\r\nin guiding the unfolding of our industrial and national life. The\r\narrangement is mainly geographical. Among the themes receiving special\r\ntreatment are: The Eastern Gateway of the United States, the Appalachian\r\nBarrier, the Great Lakes and American Commerce, the Civil War, and\r\nMines and Mountain Life. Closing chapters deal with the unity and\r\ndiversity of American life and with physiography as affecting American\r\ndestiny.\r\n\r\nThe book will be found particularly interesting and valuable to\r\nstudents and teachers of geography and history, but it will also\r\nappeal to the general reader. The very large number of rare and\r\nattractive photographs and the numerous maps are of importance\r\nin vivifying and explaining the text.\r\n\r\n=================================================================\r\n\r\nGINN & COMPANY PUBLISHERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=================================================================\r\n\r\nThe best example in this country of the kind of books that geography\r\nneeds.--_The Nation_\r\n\r\nTHE LAKES OF NORTH AMERICA\r\n\r\nBy ISRAEL C. RUSSELL\r\n\r\nProfessor of Geology in the University of Michigan\r\n\r\n8vo. Cloth, xi + 125 pages. Illustrated. List price, $1.50;\r\nmailing price, $1.65\r\n\r\nRecent advances have made physical geography almost a new science.\r\nProfessor Russell here presents a single phase, but one of great\r\nimportance. The work is based upon his original investigations, and\r\nis at once thoroughly scientific in substance and enjoyably popular\r\nin style.\r\n\r\nAs a text-book or reading book for students in geography and geology\r\nthe \"Lakes of North America\" possesses a unique value. Its interest\r\nto the general reader is enhanced by its illustrations and its happy\r\ndescriptions of lake scenery.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLACIERS OF NORTH AMERICA\r\n\r\nBy ISRAEL C. RUSSELL, Professor of Geology in the University of Michigan\r\nAuthor of \"Lakes of North America\"\r\n\r\n8vo. Cloth. x + 210 pages., Illustrated. List price, $1.75;\r\nmailing price, $1.90\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent explorations have shown that North America contains thousands of\r\nglaciers, some of which are not only vastly larger than any in Europe,\r\nbut belong to types of ice bodies not there represented. In the study\r\nof the glaciers of North America, and especially of those in Alaska,\r\nProfessor Russell has taken an active part; and this book not only\r\npresents the results of his own explorations but also a condensed and\r\naccurate statement of the present status of glacial investigations. Its\r\npopular character and numerous illustrations will make it of interest to\r\nthe general reader.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_DEPARTMENT OF SPECIAL PUBLICATION_\r\n\r\n=================================================================\r\n\r\nGINN & COMPANY PUBLISHERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nThis transcription was derived from the 1905 publication obtained from\r\nThe Internet Archive. As the Index of the original 1905 book is missing\r\nentries for U and V, the Index from the 1921 version was used to add the\r\nmissing sections.\r\n\r\nOne error was noted in preparing this revision (page 493 under Hudson\r\nRiver should have been 417). Several hyphenated vs. unhyphenated forms\r\nwere standardized to the most prevalent. Minor corrections were made\r\nwhere periods, commas, etc. were missing. A number of paragraphs which\r\nwere split by images were rejoined. In some cases, the text was moved to\r\nthe preceding or following page. As ALL CAPS was employed for the\r\nChapter Titles in the original book, the small caps subchapter headings\r\nand Figure captions were not converted to all caps. The oe ligature in\r\nCoelenterates was converted to \"oe\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Elements of Geology, by William Harmon Norton",
