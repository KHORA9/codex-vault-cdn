Every activity of man and most of Nature's have felt her\r\nquickening hand. Her eye is upon the rest. Drinking is going out because\r\nthe drinker is inefficient. The fly is going out because he carries germs.\r\nAnd for everything that goes out something else comes in that makes people\r\nhealthier and more comfortable, and, perhaps, wiser.\r\n\r\nOne strange thing about this flood-tide of science is that it overwhelms\r\nthe old, buttressed superstitions the easiest of all, once it really sets\r\nabout it. For instance, nothing could have been better fortified for\r\ncenturies than the fact that night air is injurious and should be shut out\r\nof house. Then, science turned its eye upon night air, found it a little\r\ncooler, a trifle moister, and somewhat cleaner than day air with the\r\nresult that we all invite it indoors, now, and even go out to meet it.\r\n\r\nOnce interested in the air, science soon began to take up that\r\ncommonplace but baffling phase of it called the weather. Now, of all\r\nmatters under the sun the weather was the deepest intrenched in\r\nsuperstition and hearsay. From the era of Noah it had been made the\r\nsubject of more remarks unrelieved by common sense than any other. It was\r\nat once the commonest topic for conversation and the rarest for thought.\r\nConsidering the opportunities for study of the weather this conclusion, we\r\nmust admit, is more surprising than complimentary to the human race. But\r\nit is so. The fact that science had to face was this: that the weather had\r\nbeen and remained a tremendous, dimly-recognized factor in our level of\r\nliving. So talk about it all must. And science set about finding some easy\r\nfundamental truths to talk instead of the hereditary gossip about\r\nold-fashioned winters or the usual meaningless conversational coin.\r\n\r\nTwo groups of men had always known a good deal about the weather from\r\nexperience: the sailor had to know it to save his life, and the farmer had\r\nto cultivate a weather eye along with his early peas. But the ordinary\r\nbusiness man (and wife), the town-dweller, and even the suburbanite knew\r\nso few of the proven facts that the weather from day to day, from hour to\r\nhour, was a continual puzzle to them. The rain not only fell upon the\r\njust and unjust but it fell unquestioned, or misunderstood.\r\n\r\nAt last Science established some sort of a Weather Bureau in 1870, in our\r\ncountry, and after this had triumphed over great handicaps, the Government\r\nset it upon its present footing in 1891. An intelligent interest in the\r\nweather was in likelihood of being aroused by maps, pamphlets, frost and\r\nflood warnings that saved dollars and lives. Then suddenly, or almost\r\nsuddenly, a new force was felt in every community. It was the call of\r\noutdoors. The new land of woods and lakes was explored. Men learned that\r\nliving by bread alone (without air) made a very stuffy existence. Hence\r\nthe man in town opened all his windows at night, the suburban majority\r\nplanned to build sleeping porches, the youngsters begged to go to camp,\r\ntheir fathers went hunting and fishing in increasing numbers, and, most\r\nimportant of all, the fathers' wives began to accompany them into the\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\nThus, living has been turned inside out,--the very state of things that\r\nold scientist Plato recommended some thirty thousand moons ago. And among\r\nthe manifestations of nature the weather is holding its place, important\r\nand even fascinating. For the person who most depends on umbrellas and the\r\nsubway in the city needs to watch the sky most carefully in the woods.\r\nThat old academic question as to whether it be wise or foolish to come in\r\nout of the wet was never settled by the wilderness veteran. The veteran's\r\nwife settles it very quickly. She considers the cloud. When the commuter\r\ngoes camping he rightly likes his comforts. A wet skin is not one of\r\nthese. Therefore he studies the feel of the wind.\r\n\r\nAnd so it comes about that the person who talks about storm centers and\r\nareas of high pressure and cumulus clouds is no longer regarded as\r\nslightly unhinged. Men are eager to learn the laws of the snowstorm and\r\nthe cold wave; for, with the knowledge that snow is not poison and cold\r\nnot necessarily discomfort, January has been opened up for enjoyments that\r\nJuly could never give.\r\n\r\nBookwriting and camping are both explained by the same fact,--a certain\r\nfondness for the thing. I wanted to see the commoner weather pinned down\r\nto facts. The following chapters resulted. They constitute a sort of\r\nOverhead Baedeker, it being their pleasure to show up the sureties of the\r\nsun and rain and to star the weather signs that can be relied upon. For,\r\nafter all, even the elements, although unruled, are law-abiding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING THE WEATHER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nOUR WELL-ORDERED ATMOSPHERE\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is anything that has been overlooked more than another it is our\r\natmosphere. But it absolutely cannot be avoided--in books on the weather.\r\nIt deserves a chapter, anyway, because if it were not for the atmosphere\r\nthis earth of ours would be a wizened and sterile lump. It would float\r\nuselessly about in the general cosmos like the moon.\r\n\r\nTo be sure the earth does not loom very large in the eye of the sun. It\r\nreceives a positively trifling fraction of the total output of sunheat. So\r\nnegligible is this amount that it would not be worth our mentioning if we\r\ndid not owe our existence to it. It is thanks to the atmosphere, however,\r\nthat the earth attains this (borrowed) importance. It is thanks to this\r\nthin layer of gases that we are protected from that fraction of sunheat\r\nwhich, however trifling when compared with the whole, would otherwise be\r\nsufficient to fry us all in a second. Without this gas wrapping we would\r\nall freeze (if still unfried) immediately after sunset. The atmosphere\r\nkeeps us in a sort of thermos globe, unmindful of the burning power of the\r\ngreat star, and of the uncalculated cold of outer space.\r\n\r\nYet, limitless as it seems to us and inexhaustible, our invaluable\r\natmosphere is a small thing after all. Half of its total bulk is\r\ncompressed into the first three and a half miles upward. Only one\r\nsixty-fourth of it lies above the twenty-one mile limit. Compared with the\r\nthickness of the earth this makes a very thin envelope.\r\n\r\nLight as air, we say, forgetting that this stuff that looks so thin and\r\ninconsequential weighs fifteen pounds to the square inch. We walk around\r\ncarrying our fourteen tons gaily enough. The only reason that we don't\r\ngrumble is because the gases press evenly in all directions permeating our\r\ntissues and thereby supporting this crushing burden. A layer of water\r\nthirty-four feet thick weighs just about as much as this air-pack under\r\nwhich we feel so buoyant. But if these gases get in motion we feel their\r\npressure. We say the wind is strong to-day.\r\n\r\nAs it blows along the surface of the earth this wind is mostly nitrogen,\r\noxygen, moisture, and dust. The nitrogen occupies nearly eight-tenths of a\r\ngiven bulk of air, the oxygen two-tenths, and the moisture anything up to\r\none-twentieth. Five other gases are present in small quantities. The dust\r\nand the water vapor occupy space independently of the rest. As one goes up\r\nmountains the water vapor increases for a couple of thousand feet and then\r\ndecreases to the seven mile limit after which it has almost completely\r\nvanished. The lightest gases have been detected as high up as two hundred\r\nmiles and scientists think that hydrogen, the lightest of all, may escape\r\naltogether from the restraint of gravity. One strange fact about all of\r\nthese gases is that they do not form a separate chemical combination,\r\nalthough they are thoroughly mixed.\r\n\r\nAt first glance the extreme readiness of the atmosphere to carry dust and\r\nbacteria does not seem a point in its favor. In reality it is. Most\r\nbacteria are really allies of the human race. They benefit us by producing\r\nfermentations and disintegrations of soils that prepare them for plant\r\nfood. It is a pity that the few disease breeding types of bacteria should\r\nhave given the family a bad name. Without bacteria the sheltering\r\natmosphere would have nothing but desert rock to protect.\r\n\r\nFurther, rain is accounted for only by the dust. Of course this sounds\r\nvery near the world's record in absurdities. But it is a half truth at\r\nleast, for moisture cannot condense on nothing. Every drop of rain, every\r\nglobule of mist must have a nucleus. Consequently each wind that blows,\r\neach volcano that erupts is laying up dust for a rainy day. Apparently the\r\natmosphere is empty. Actually it is full enough of dust-nuclei to outfit a\r\nfullgrown fog if the dewpoint should be favorable. If there were no dust\r\nin the air all shadows would be intensest black, the sunlight blinding.\r\n\r\nBut the dust particles fulfill their greatest mission as heat\r\ncollectors,--they and the particles of water vapor which have embraced\r\nthem. It is in reality owing to these water globules and not to the\r\natmosphere that supports them that we are enabled to live in such\r\ncomfortable temperatures. For the air strata above seven miles where the\r\ntides of oxygen and nitrogen have rid themselves of water and dust absorb\r\nvery little of the solar radiation. The heat is grabbed by the lowest\r\nlayer of air as it goes by. The air snatches it both going and coming. The\r\nlittle particles get about half of it on the way down and when it is\r\nradiated back very little escapes them.\r\n\r\nSo it comes about that the heavy moist air near the earth is the warmest\r\nof all. It would, of course, get very warm if, as it collected its heat,\r\nit didn't have a tendency to rise. As it rises, moreover, it must fight\r\ngravity, that arch enemy of all rising things. And as it fights it loses\r\nenergy, which is heat. So high altitudes and low temperatures are found\r\ntogether for these two reasons. But after the limit of moisture content\r\nhas been reached the temperature gets no lower according to reliable\r\ninvestigations. Instead a monotony of 459° below zero eternally\r\nprevails--459° is called the absolute zero of space.\r\n\r\nThe vertical heating arrangements of the atmosphere appear somewhat\r\nirregular. But horizontally it is in a much worse way. The surface of the\r\nglobe is three quarters water and one quarter land and irregularly\r\narranged at that. The shiny water surfaces reflect a good deal of the heat\r\nwhich they receive, they use up the heat in evaporation and what they do\r\nabsorb penetrates far. The land surfaces, on the contrary, absorb most of\r\nthe heat received, but it does not penetrate to any depth. As a\r\nconsequence of these differences land warms up about four times as\r\nquickly as water and cools off about four times as fast. Therefore the\r\ntemperature of air over continents is liable to much more rapid and\r\nextreme changes than the air over the oceans.\r\n\r\nThe disparity of temperature is also rendered much greater because of\r\ndiffering areas of cloud and clear skies, because of interfering mountain\r\nmasses, because of the change from day to night, or the constant progress\r\nof the seasons. At first blush it seems remarkable that the atmosphere\r\nshould not be hopelessly unsettled in its habits, that there should belong\r\nto it any hint of system. As a matter of fact, in the main its courses are\r\nas well-ordered as the sun's. Cause and not caprice are at the bottom of\r\nthe wind's listings. Its one desire is rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CIRRUS DEEPENING TO CIRRO-STRATUS\r\n\r\n_Courtesy of Richard F. Warren_\r\n\r\nCirrus clouds first appear as feathery lines converging toward one or two\r\npoints on the horizon, often merging into bands of darker clouds, arranged\r\nhorizontally. A sky like this appears when there is little wind. If the\r\nwind shifts to an easterly direction by way of north there will likely be\r\nsnow within 24 hours; if it works around by way of the southwest and south\r\n36 hours will probably pass before rain. If the mares' tails, as here, are\r\nabsent and yet the stratified clouds are present there is little\r\nlikelihood of a storm. Cirrus clouds precede every disturbance of\r\nmagnitude. Sometimes they are hidden by a lower cloud layer.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut rest it rarely succeeds in finding. Forever warming, rising, cooling,\r\nfalling, it rushes about to regain its equilibrium. With so many opposing\r\nforces at work the calm day is the real marvel, our weeks of Indian Summer\r\nthe ranking miracle of our climate. The very evolution of the myriad\r\npatches of air quilted over the earth with their different opportunities\r\nto become heated, to cool their heels, precludes stability in our so\r\ncalled Temperate Zone. But over great stretches of the earth's surface\r\nconditions are continuous enough to discipline the atmosphere into\r\nstrict routine. Conjure the globe before your eyes and you will find the\r\nscheme of atmospheric circulation something like this:\r\n\r\nA broad band of heated air perpetually rises from the sweltering\r\nequatorial belt of lands and seas. The supply never ceases, the warming\r\nprocess goes on night and day, and to a great height the light warm\r\nincense mounts. Then, cooling, from this altitude it begins to run down\r\nhill toward the poles. This is happening all the way around the globe. So\r\nnaturally the common centers, the poles, cannot accommodate all this\r\ndownrush of air. Therefore as it approaches the goal it falls into a\r\nmajestic file about the center, very much as water does in running out of\r\na hole in the center of a circular basin. The nearer north, the cooler\r\nthis vast maelstrom grows and the nearer has it sunk to the earth. It\r\ndescends circuitously and, by the force arising from the earth's rotation,\r\nis sheered to the right in the northern hemisphere, to the left in the\r\nsouthern.\r\n\r\nWatching the water circle out of the basin you will notice the outside\r\nwhirl is in no hurry to get to the center. This corresponds to the\r\neasterly trades of commerce, geography, and fiction. The direction of the\r\nupper currents flowing back to the poles is from southwest to northeast;\r\nbut in our middle zones this becomes almost from west to east, is constant\r\nand is known to the profession as the prevailing westerlies.\r\n\r\nLook up some day when wisps of clouds are floating very high. You will\r\nnotice that their port is in the east, mattering not what wind may be\r\nblowing where you are. They are above the petty disturbances of the\r\nshallow surface winds. They follow a Gulf Stream of immeasurable grandeur.\r\nOnward, always onward, they sail, emblems of a great serenity.\r\n\r\nBeneath this vast drift of air, which increases in velocity as it nears\r\nthe pole, is an undertow from two to three miles thick. It is the\r\nmovements of this undertow that affect our lives. These movements are\r\ninfluenced by all the changes of temperature and by the configurations of\r\nland. They take the form of whirls. These whirls may be small eddies,\r\nlocal in effect, or vast cyclones with diameters of fifteen hundred miles.\r\nSmall or large they roll along under the Westerlies, translated by\r\nfriction, and invariably moving for most of their course in an easterly\r\ndirection, like their tractor above. They circle across the United States\r\nevery few days. Their courses do not vary a great deal, and yet enough to\r\nmake each one a matter for conjecture. And all the conjecturing centers\r\nupon the condition of the atmosphere,--the changing atmosphere which is\r\nyet so dependable.\r\n\r\nThe weather we are used to, the daily weather that catches us unprepared,\r\nand yet that does not mistreat us all the time is the product of these\r\nlittle whirls, which are so remotely connected with the grander\r\natmospheric movements of our planet. Remembering this, we can at last come\r\nback to earth and set about our real business which is to see why certain\r\nkinds of weather come at such uncertain times and how to tell when they\r\nwill arrive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE CLEAR DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nWe owe our fair weather to that department of atmospheric activity called\r\nanticyclone by the weatherman. The anticyclone is an accumulation of air\r\nwhich has become colder than the air surrounding it. This accumulation\r\noftener than not has an area near the center where the air is coldest.\r\nAbout this coldest area the air currents revolve in the direction of a\r\nclock's hands. And since this cold air is contracted and denser than its\r\nwarmer environment it has a perpetual tendency to whirl outward from the\r\ncenter into this warmer environment.\r\n\r\nOne comes to think, therefore, of the anticyclone as a huge pyramid of\r\ncold air moving slowly across the country from west to east and all the\r\nwhile melting down on all sides, like a plate of ice-cream, into the\r\nsurrounding territory. It is such an immense accumulation that often while\r\nits head is reared over Montana the first shivers of its approach are\r\nbeginning to be felt in Texas and Pennsylvania. It does not extend\r\nequally far, however, to the north and west of its head, which is really\r\nsometimes where its tail ought to be. That is, a long slope of increasing\r\npressure and cold will sweep in a gentle gradient from Pennsylvania to\r\nMontana and will then decrease by a very steep gradient to the Pacific\r\nCoast.\r\n\r\nThe anticyclone draws its power from the inexhaustible supplies of cold\r\nair from the upper levels. This air is very dry and accounts for the\r\nalmost invariably clear skies of the anticyclone.\r\n\r\nIn winter when the intensity of all the atmospheric activities is greatly\r\nincreased, the anticyclone develops into the cold wave. The rapidly rising\r\npressure rears its head and rushes along upon the heels of a storm like a\r\nvast tidal wave at sixty miles an hour, tumbling the mercury thirty,\r\nforty, fifty degrees.\r\n\r\nThese cold waves first appear in the northwest. They cannot well originate\r\nover either ocean and a high-pressure area building up over the southern\r\nhalf of the country will not attain the sufficient degree of frigidity to\r\nearn the title, for even cold waves have been standardized by the\r\nGovernment. But although nearly all the cold waves choose Montana or the\r\nDakotas as a base, they have at least two definite lines of action. Those\r\nwhich are born amid the mountains or on the great plains of Montana have a\r\ncurious habit of bombarding the Texas coast before starting on their\r\neastward march. It is not unusual for us to read of zero weather in the\r\nPanhandle and freezing on the Gulf while the mercury may still be standing\r\nas high as fifty in New York City.\r\n\r\nIt is this rapid onslaught from Montana to Texas that produces those\r\nnotorious blizzards of that section called northers, during which the\r\ncattle used to be frozen on the hoof. The record time for a drive of this\r\nextent is about twelve hours and the normal about twenty-four which gives\r\nscant time for the Weather Bureau to warn the vast interests of the\r\nimpending assault. When the cold wave, after following this path, does\r\nswing toward the Atlantic Coast, as most of them do, it has lost interest\r\nand usually produces only seasonably cold weather along the Appalachians.\r\n\r\nThose cold waves that recruit their strength in Canada and enter the\r\nUnited States through Minnesota or, rarely, this side of the Lakes move\r\nalong the border and supply intensely cold weather for a night or two to\r\nNew England and the Middle Atlantic States.\r\n\r\nCold waves almost always follow a storm. The storm, being an area of low\r\npressure makes a fit receptacle for the surplus of the high pressure, and\r\nsince the whole business of the weather is to seek peace and pursue it,\r\nthe greater the discrepancies the more violent the pursuit. Consequently\r\nwe have the spectacle of a ridge of cold dry air following and trying to\r\nlevel up a fleeing hollow of warm moist air--but rarely succeeding. This\r\nprinciple of action and reaction is almost the sole principle of the\r\nweather and is nowhere more clearly demonstrated than in the winter's\r\nsuccession of storm and cold wave.\r\n\r\nIn summer the anticyclones are not only actually but relatively more\r\nmoderate than in winter. But their influence is still the same,--clear\r\nskies, cooler nights, dry, westerly winds. During the year the anticyclone\r\nfurnishes us with about sixty per cent. of our weather. The cyclone is\r\nresponsible for the remaining forty per cent. The weather depends on the\r\ncyclone for its variety and upon the anticyclone for its reputation. So it\r\nis well to be able to recognize an anticyclone when one appears.\r\n\r\nThe first and most reliable symptom of the approach of an anticyclone is\r\nthe west wind. This sign is valid the country over, and is one of the\r\nvery few signs that hold true for most of the North Temperate Zone. In\r\nsummer over our country the west wind comes from the southwest, to be\r\nIrish, and in winter from the northwest. But for nearly all of our\r\nforty-eight states for nearly all of the year the westerly winds are those\r\nthat bring us fair days and nights. And it is these crisp, clear days and\r\ncloudless, brilliant nights which we have in mind when we boast to English\r\nfriends of our American weather.\r\n\r\nThe west wind is so popular because it has a slight downward flowing\r\ntendency. It also blows from land to sea over all America except the\r\nnarrow Pacific coast. These downward, outward directions allow it to\r\ngather only enough moisture to keep it from becoming seriously dry. Its\r\nupper sources supply it with ozone. Its density gives it weight and by its\r\nsuperior weight it prevails. It dries roads faster than a brace of suns\r\ncould do it. It is tonic. And curiously enough, although the anticyclone\r\nloads half a ton excess weight upon us we like it. The greater the burden\r\nthe more we feel like leaping and shouting. Our good cheer seems to be\r\nground out of us, like street pianos.\r\n\r\nThe reverse holds, too. For when the anticyclone moves off us and the\r\ncyclone hovers over us, removing half a ton of pressure, instead of\r\nfeeling relieved we feel depressed, out of spirit. The animals share this\r\nreaction with us. In fact barnyards antedated barometers as forecasters,\r\nbecause all the domestic creatures, with pigs in particular, evidenced the\r\ndisagreeable leniency of the low pressure areas upon their persons.\r\n\r\n    \"Grumphie smells the weather\r\n      An' Grumphie smells the wun'\r\n    He kens when clouds will gather\r\n      An' smoor the blinkin' sun.\"\r\n\r\nThe only trouble about this rather extravagant tribute to the pig,\r\nversatile though he is, is that he can tell only a very few hours ahead\r\nabout the coming changes and it takes so much more skill to judge what his\r\nactions mean than to read the face of the sky that the science of\r\nmeteorology finally comes to supplant barnyardology.\r\n\r\nThe coming of the anticyclone is foretold by the shifting of the wind from\r\nany quarter to the west. The course that the center of the anticyclone is\r\nkeeping may be watched by the same agency. Since the circulation from the\r\ncone of cold air follows the hour hands of a clock it follows that if the\r\ncenter is moving north of you the wind, blowing outward from the center,\r\nwill work from west to northwest and from northwest to north and slightly\r\neast of north.\r\n\r\nIf the wind has shifted into the west on a Wednesday, it will likely be\r\ncold by Wednesday night and colder on Thursday. By Friday morning the wind\r\nwill be coming from the north, likely, with the lowest temperature of all.\r\nBy Saturday the cold will moderate, the wind will tire and gradually die\r\nto a calm or become weakly variable. The four day supremacy of the\r\nanticyclone will be over. But, mind you, there are a dozen variations of\r\nthis routine. I am only suggesting a usual one.\r\n\r\nIf after blowing two or three days from the west the wind shifts to the\r\nsouthwest and south, you may know that the central cold area is passing\r\nsouth of you and that its intensity will not be great. While these\r\nanticyclones that float down and to the right of their normal path linger\r\nlonger, they are never so severely cold, nor, alas, so uniformly clear as\r\nthe others. It is a profound law of anticyclones and even more\r\nparticularly of cyclones, that if they deviate to the right they weaken,\r\nif they are pushed by an obstacle to the left they increase greatly in\r\nintensity.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the central portion of an anticyclone passes over your\r\nlocality. Then the wind will fall. The frost will be keen and the cold\r\nwill be notably dry and invigorating. In summer although the sunlight may\r\nbe powerfully bright and the heat great, yet the air will have a buoyant\r\neffect, the body a resilience. And the nights will cool swiftly. Soon\r\nafter the center passes from the locality a wind will spring up from the\r\neast with rapidly rising temperature and increased humidity.\r\n\r\nThe coldest part of the anticyclone is not, as one would suppose, at the\r\ncenter, but in advance of it; and its authority, like a schoolmaster's, is\r\nrapidly dissipated after its back is turned upon a place.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of an anticyclone is measured by its wind velocity and by\r\nthe degree of cold obtaining under its influence. But the greatest cold\r\noccurs rarely in conjunction with the greatest velocity of the wind. The\r\ncalms that occur at sunrise enable radiation to take an extra spurt which\r\npushes the mercury lower by a degree or so than happens when the wind is\r\nblowing. But, windy or calm, the period about sunrise is normally the\r\ncoldest of the day, even extending in midwinter for as much as half an\r\nhour after sunrise, so slow are the feeble rays at restoring the balance\r\nof loss and gain of heat.\r\n\r\nThe greatest falls occur at the advent of the cold wave, no matter whether\r\nit arrives at ten in the morning or at midnight. If the temperature\r\nstarts to decline gradually during the day, a further and decided fall may\r\nbe expected at nightfall if the sky is clear. And if the temperature rises\r\ngradually during the night the normal processes are being displaced and a\r\nchange from fair to foul is a surety. In summer the hottest time of day is\r\nnot at noon, any more than the coldest part of the winter day was at\r\nmidnight, for the reason that the sun can pour in its heat faster than the\r\nearth can radiate it, and the hour for the maximum temperature is pushed\r\nas far along toward evening as four or five or even six o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe average anticyclone continues its influence for clearness for about\r\nfour days. Some, however, hurry the whole thing through in two. Others are\r\ninterrupted by a more vigorous cyclone and are put to rout. Others are\r\nheld up by an inherent weakness and are forced to mark time over one\r\nlocality until strengthened or dissipated. And a few great ones hold sway\r\nover the country for a week. These choose the north-center of the country\r\nin which to locate. There they pile up the cold air until its very weight\r\ncauses it to move majestically on. Its skirts sweep the Gulf coast where\r\nthey are a bit bedraggled by invading cyclones. It gives the New\r\nEnglanders a fortnight of nipping, brisk days and the mercury in\r\nMinnesota and the Dakotas does not emerge above zero. Once, in Montana,\r\none of these refrigerating systems established the record of sixty-three\r\ndegrees below zero. But in Siberia where the immense extent of the land\r\nsurface collaborates with a prolonged night, an anticyclone built up an\r\narea of superior chilliness that left a world's record of ninety-one\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nIn summer a succession of these highs causes the frequent droughts of\r\nweeks which harass the West and New England. The air becomes so dry that\r\nit parches and then shrivels the green leaves. Any little cyclones that,\r\nunder ordinary conditions, would suck in moist air from the Gulf and\r\nrelieve the situation with a rain are dried out and frustrated by the\r\nunclouded sun. It requires a cyclone of great depth to overthrow the\r\nsupremacy of these summer anticyclones.\r\n\r\nWhile the anticyclone furnishes fair weather the sky is not necessarily or\r\neven usually free from clouds under its influence. In summer the\r\nevaporation during the long days overloads the air for the time being.\r\nNormally about eleven in the morning little balls and patches of white\r\nclouds dot the blue. These increase in number and size until about three\r\nin the afternoon when they will have grown little black bellies and\r\nfluffy white tops. By five they will have dwindled and by eight entirely\r\nvanished. These heaped clouds, known as cumulus, are a guarantee of a\r\nnormal atmosphere and continued fair weather. They mean that currents of\r\nwarm, moist air have risen until they have struck a level so cool as to\r\ncause them to condense part of their moisture. This condensation sinks\r\nuntil it enters a warmer stratum and the cloud is dissipated. The total\r\nmovement is a reasonable exchange that preserves the equilibrium of the\r\nair, very much as a person bends one way and then another to maintain his\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\nIn winter there is not such an opportunity offered and the few clouds that\r\nform because of the daily variation in temperature are flatter and are\r\ncalled stratus clouds. Sometimes these stratus clouds may cover the sky at\r\nmidday, but in thin platings and not leadenly. In winter as in summer they\r\ntend to disappear toward evening. They are often accompanied by an\r\nunpleasant wind, but rarely by the snow flurry which is the \"April shower\"\r\nof the winter months.\r\n\r\nBut when the snow flurry does come there is no better sign for the\r\nwoodsman of coming cold; it never fails. The morning will have begun\r\nbrilliantly, but soon great summery puffs of cloud form and increase and\r\ndarken on their under sides. Their tops are vague and wear a veil. It is\r\nthe snow. The reason is simple. The coming anticyclone strikes the upper\r\nair before it hits the earth's surface. The sudden cold causes rapid\r\ncondensation. Hence the flurries. But the anticyclone is an agent of\r\ndryness, hence their short duration. Sometimes the veil of snow does not\r\nreach the earth. Sometimes it blots out everything in a spirited squall.\r\nBut it never lasts long, except in the northwest states. And it is\r\ninvariably followed by a period of colder weather.\r\n\r\nIn summer local evaporation may be so long-continued or so vigorous that\r\nthe cumulus clouds cannot hold all their moisture content when cooled. A\r\nshower is the result, usually a trifling one and mostly without thunder.\r\nThe great thunderstorms are always in connection with the passing of a\r\ncyclone. The small heat thunderstorms are only the indulgences of a spell\r\nof fair weather. These tiny showers are daily and sometimes hourly\r\naccompaniments of clear weather in the mountains. The air warms rapidly in\r\nthe valleys and is speedily cooled on rushing up a mountain side and a\r\nthreat and a sprinkle are the result. When a performance of this sort is\r\ngoing on nobody need fear unpleasant weather of long duration.\r\n\r\nAnother pledge of a clear day that does not appear too credible on the\r\nface of it is the morning fog in summer. In winter it is a different\r\nmatter. In August and September particularly the rapidly lengthening\r\nnights allow so much heat to evaporate that the surplus moisture in the\r\nair is condensed to the depth of several hundred feet. By ten o'clock the\r\nsun has eaten into this lowest stratum, heated it and yet begins to\r\ndecline in power before the balance swings the other way, so that a\r\ncloudless day often follows a fog in those months. About three mornings of\r\nfog, however, are enough to discourage the sun and a rain follows. Of\r\ncourse this is because the anticyclone with its special properties has\r\nbeen losing power.\r\n\r\nWhen these conditions of clear nights with no wind follow the first two or\r\nthree windy days of the anticyclone, particularly in autumn and spring,\r\nfrost results. In winter the chances that a fog will be dissipated are\r\nrather slim. But if it shows a tendency to rise all may yet be well.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CIRRO-STRATUS WITH CIRRO-CUMULUS BENEATH\r\n\r\n_Courtesy of Richard F. Warren_\r\n\r\nThe fine-spun lines of the cirrus proper drag this veil of whitish cloud\r\nover the sky. The sun sometimes is surrounded by a colored halo due to the\r\nrefraction of the light by the ice crystals. But more often it vanishes\r\nbehind the veil. The mottled clouds below the veil show that a rather\r\nrapid condensation of the moisture in the air is taking place. This sky is\r\ndistinctly threatening, although the direction and force of the wind will\r\nmore accurately foretell the severity of the coming storm. With this sky\r\nexpect rain or snow within 12 hours.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAn excellent sign of clear weather is this fact of the morning mist rising\r\nfrom ravines in the mountains. And even if you haven't any mountain\r\nravines at command the altitude of clouds can be observed. It is safer to\r\nhave them lessen in number rather than increase, scatter rather than\r\ncombine. The higher the clouds the finer the weather. And if the sky\r\nthrough the rifts is a clear untarnished blue the prospects of settled\r\nweather are much better than with fewer clouds and a milky blue sky\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\nAfter the direction of the wind and the shapes of the clouds the colors of\r\nthe sky are a great help in the reading of the morrow's promise. And the\r\nbest time to read this promise is in the morning or evening when the half\r\nlights emphasize the coloring.\r\n\r\nSoon after the close observation of cloud colors has commenced the amazing\r\ndiscovery is made that the same color at sunrise means exactly the reverse\r\nof its meaning at sunset.\r\n\r\n    \"Sky red in the morning\r\n      A sailor's sure warning,\r\n    Sky red at night\r\n      A sailor's delight.\"\r\n\r\nChrist seized upon this phenomenon to throw confusion into the Pharisees\r\nand Sadducees when they asked that He would show them a sign from Heaven.\r\nAs Matthew reports it:--\"He answered and said unto them, When it is\r\nevening ye say, It will be fair weather for the sky is red. And in the\r\nmorning It will be foul weather to-day for the sky is red and lowering. O\r\nye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but ye cannot discern\r\nthe signs of the times.\"\r\n\r\nThe reasons for this contradictory evidence of color are not nearly so\r\nobvious as the fact itself. Taking the scientist's word for it need not\r\nstretch one's credulity overmuch if he can be followed step by step. He\r\nsays that sunlight is white light, and white is the sublime combination of\r\nevery color. If no atmosphere existed about us the light would all come\r\nthrough, leaving the sky black. The atmosphere, however, which is full of\r\ndust and water particles, breaks up these rays, these white sheaves of\r\nlight, into their various colors. The longest vibrations, which are the\r\nred, and the shortest, which are the violet, get by and the rest are\r\nturned back, mixing up into the color which we call our blue sky.\r\n\r\nIf the dust and water particles grow so large and numerous as to divert\r\nmore of the short rays than usual we get a redder glow than usual. This is\r\nmost noticeable when the sun and clouds are near the horizon for the air\r\nthrough which they appear is nearer the earth and consequently dirtier. If\r\nthese water globules mass together so as to reflect all the rays alike the\r\nresult is a whitish appearance. That is why a fog bank, composed of tiny\r\ndroplets, each reflecting with all its might, can make the sky a dull and\r\nuniform gray.\r\n\r\nAs evening approaches the temperature of the normal day lowers. As the\r\ntemperature lowers it is the tendency of the moisture in the air to\r\ncondense about the little dust particles in the air. And as these\r\nparticles increase in size their tendency is to reflect more and more of\r\nthe waning rays of light. Therefore if the sky is gray in the evening it\r\nmeans that the atmosphere already contains a good deal of condensed\r\nmoisture. If the cooling should go on through the night, as it normally\r\nwould, condensation would continue with rain as the likely result.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, after the evening's cooling has progressed and yet\r\nthe colors near the horizon are prevailingly red it means that there is so\r\nlittle moisture in the atmosphere that the further increase due to the\r\nnight's condensation will not be sufficient to cause rain. Hence the\r\nnatural delight of the sailor.\r\n\r\nA gray morning sky implies an atmosphere full of water precisely as an\r\nevening gray does. The difference lies in the ensuing process. By morning\r\nthe temperature has reached its lowest point and if this has not been\r\nsufficient to cause cooling to the rainpoint the chance for rain will be\r\ncontinually lessened by the growing heat of the rising sun. The gray,\r\ntherefore, is the normal indication of a clear cool night which has\r\npermitted radiation and therefore condensation to this degree. It is for\r\nthis reason that we have the heavy fogs of August and September followed\r\nby cloudless days.\r\n\r\nA red morning sky shows, like the red evening sky, that condensation has\r\nnot taken place to any extent. But this is abnormal for a clear night\r\ncauses condensation. The red therefore means that a layer of heavy moist\r\nair above the surface levels has prevented the normal radiation. Hence\r\nwhen the day's evaporation adds more moisture to that already at the\r\nhigher levels the total humidity is likely to increase beyond the dewpoint\r\nwith the resultant rain.\r\n\r\nThese two color auguries are among the most reliable of all the weather\r\nsigns. Unfortunately the sunrises are scarcely ever on hand to be examined\r\nexcept by milkmen. But a careful scrutiny of the sunset will make one\r\nproficient in shades. In summer when the sun burns round and clear-cut and\r\nred on the rim of the horizon the air contains much dust and smoke, the\r\naccompaniment of dry weather. And as dry weather has a way of perpetuating\r\nitself such a sun makes dry and continued weather a safe prophecy. In\r\nwinter the same red and flaming sun setting brilliant as new minted gold\r\nis a sure indication of clear and cold weather. In all seasons the light\r\ntints of the evening sky mean the atmosphere at its best. A golden sunset,\r\na light breeze from the west, a glowing horizon as the sun goes down, slow\r\nfading colors all constitute a hundred to one bet for continued fair\r\nweather. The sunset colors that are surely followed by storm will be\r\ndiscussed in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nThe sky is too little regarded. Architects that do not consider the sky\r\nare behind in their calling. Maxfield Parrish has made himself famous by\r\nallying himself with its seas of color. The hunter can read it and learn\r\nwhether he may sleep dry without his tent. Only we who shut ourselves\r\nwithin rooms and behind newspapers forget that there is a sky--until it\r\nfalls and we are taken to a sanitarium.\r\n\r\nFrom the night itself much may be discovered about the continuance of fair\r\nweather. A sky well sown with stars is a good sign. If only a few stars\r\nare visible the clear spell is about over. Stars twinkle because of abrupt\r\nvariation in the temperature of the air strata. If the wind is from the\r\nwest cold and clear will result no matter how much may twinkle twinkle\r\nlittle star. But if he twinkle with the wind from the south or east the\r\ncloud will soon fly. That is the way with these weather signs. One sign\r\ndoes not make a prophecy. It is the combination that has strength and\r\nreliability. Furthermore the eye must be trained by many comparisons.\r\n\r\nOf all the conditions that make night forecasting easy the later evenings\r\nof the moon are the best. The moon furnishes just the proper amount of\r\nillumination to betray the air conditions. If she swims clear and\r\ntriumphant well and good. If she rides bright while dark bellying clouds\r\nsweep over her in summer, inconsequential showers may follow. But if she\r\ndisappears by faint degrees behind a thin but close knit curtain of cloud\r\nthe clear weather is being definitely concluded.\r\n\r\nA great many changes in the weather take place after three in the morning.\r\nMost campers are accustomed to waking anyway once or twice to replenish\r\nthe fire, and a glance at the stars will show the sleepiest what changes\r\nare occurring in the eternal panorama. A man may have gone to bed in\r\nsecurity to get up in a snowstorm, whereas a survey of the skies at three\r\nwould have noted the coming change. The habit of waking in the dead of\r\nnight,--which isn't really so dead after all,--is not an unpleasant one.\r\nIts compensations are set forth in a beautiful and vivid chapter of\r\nStewart Edward White's \"The Forest.\" Every camper knows them, and this\r\nadded mastery that a knowledge of the skies gives him lends a sense of\r\npower, which lasts until the unexpected happens.\r\n\r\nFor the unexpected happens to the best regulated of all forecasters, the\r\nGovernment. Equipped with every instrument and with an army whose business\r\nis nothing else than to hunt down storms and warn the public, the Weather\r\nBureau is still surprised fifteen times out of a hundred by unforeseeable\r\nchanges in atmospheric pressure. It is scarcely likely then that amateurs\r\nwithout flawless barometers and without reports of the current weather in\r\nthree hundred places could hope to foretell with complete accuracy. But\r\nthere is a place for the amateur, aside from his own personal\r\ngratification and profit. The Weather Bureau within the limits of the\r\npresent appropriation cannot expect to predict for every village and\r\nborough. That the amateur may do and with as great accuracy for the few\r\nhours immediately in advance.\r\n\r\nThe Weather Bureau may predict with this large percentage of\r\naccuracy--85%--for forty-eight hours in advance because its scope is\r\ncountry wide. It may even forecast in a general way for seven days and\r\nstill maintain a considerable advantage over almanac guesswork. But the\r\nman who is relying upon local signs is limited to ten or at most twelve\r\nhours. Of course he may guess beyond that but it is only a guess. The work\r\nthat the Bureau does and that he may do within his limits is not\r\nguesswork. Meteorology is an exact science, and forecasting is an art.\r\nBoth may be studied now in classes under professors with degrees in the\r\nsame way that any other science and art may be studied. The old sort of\r\nweather wisdom which was a startling compound of wisdom, superstition, and\r\ninanity has passed away, or is passing away as rational weather talk\r\nspreads.\r\n\r\nThese limits of the layman--ten hours with no instruments--are further\r\ndefined by his locality. In mountainous country changes come more quickly\r\nthan in level localities, in winter than in summer, so that one's\r\nprophetic time-limit is shortened.\r\n\r\nWhile the best indications of the clear day are the great fundamental\r\nones, there are many little signs that bolster up one's confidence in\r\none's own predictions. The lessened humidity coincident with clear weather\r\nis responsible often for many little household prognostics. Salt is dry.\r\nThe windows (of your summer cottage) do not stick. The children are less\r\nrestless. Smoke ascends, or if the wind is blowing is not flattened to the\r\nground. Flies are merely insects, for the time being, and not the devil.\r\nSwallows and the other birds that eat insects fly high because that is\r\nwhere the insects are. Spiders do not hesitate to make their webs on the\r\nlawn. They welcome dew but distrust rain. Cow and sheep feed quietly,\r\nrarely calling to one another as they do before a storm. In short the\r\ngeneral aspect of these is normal and therefore remains unnoticed.\r\n\r\nBut all these household prognostics may be advertising the most placid\r\nweather while only twelve hours away and coming at sixty miles an hour may\r\nbe the severest storm of the season. The Weather Bureau with its maps and\r\nbarometers follows its every movement. The man in the woods whose comfort\r\nin summer and whose life in winter may depend upon his preparedness for\r\nthe approaching storm does well to read its warnings and know its laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE STORM CYCLE\r\n\r\n\r\nDoubtless those who hope for a Hereafter of unmitigated ease and song,\r\ndesire, on this earth, one long, sweet anticyclone. But theirs, in most of\r\nthe United States, is disappointment. With an irregularity that seems\r\nperversely regular at times our fair weather is interrupted by a storm\r\nwhich in turn gives way to some more fair weather or another storm,--there\r\nis no telling which very long in advance. And that is why American weather\r\nranks high among our speculative interests.\r\n\r\nTo emphasize this irregularity a seemingly regular succession of events\r\nmay be noticed. It will cloud up, let's say, on a Sunday, rain on Monday\r\nand Tuesday, clear on Wednesday, staying clear until Sunday when it will\r\ncloud up for the repeat. During this past season it rained on a dozen\r\nwashdays in succession. The newspapers grew jocular about it. And very\r\noften one notices two or three rainy Sundays in a row. By actual\r\nobservation this year we enjoyed fifteen clear Thursdays in succession in\r\na normal spring.\r\n\r\nThe weather gets into a rut. And if the anticyclones and cyclones were all\r\nof the same intensity it is conceivable that the rainy Sundays might go on\r\nuntil the Day of Rest was changed by Statute. But the intensities of the\r\nwhirls differ. Before long an anticyclone feebler than ordinary is\r\novertaken by a cyclone and annihilated. Or one stronger than the average\r\nmay dominate the situation for several days. Or the great body of cold air\r\nin winter over the interior of Canada may send a succession of moderate\r\nantis across our country making a barrier of dry cold air through which\r\nthe lurking cyclone can not push.\r\n\r\nMostly, however, three days of anticyclonic influence and three days of\r\ncyclonic influence with one day in between for rest, the transition\r\nperiod, make up a normal week of it. Let the American farmer thank his\r\nstars (and clouds) for that. For no other regions of the earth are so\r\nconsistently watered and sunned all the year round as the great expanse of\r\nthe North American Continent.\r\n\r\nThe cyclone is that activity of the atmosphere which prevents us from\r\nsuffering from an eternal drought. The cyclone is an accumulation of air\r\nwhich has become warmer than the air about it. This area of air usually\r\nhas a central portion that is warmest of all. Since warmth expands, this\r\nair grows lighter and rises. Nature, steadfast in her grudge against a\r\nvacuum, causes the surrounding air to rush it. Since these contending\r\ncurrents cannot all occupy the central area at once they fall into a vast\r\nascending spiral that spins faster and faster as it approaches the center.\r\nImagine an inverted whirlpool. It is a replica on a much smaller scale of\r\nthe great polar influx, except that the latter has a descending motion.\r\n\r\nThe cyclone thus is tails to the anticyclone's heads, the reverse of the\r\ncoin. Where the anti's air was cool and dry the cyclone's is warm and\r\nmoist. The anti had a downward tendency and a motion, in our hemisphere,\r\nflowing outward from the apex in generous curves in the direction of clock\r\nhands. The cyclone has an upward tendency, flowing inward to the core\r\ncontrariwise to clock hands.\r\n\r\nFrom these two great actions and reactions come all the varieties of our\r\nweather. To understand the procession of the cyclones and anticyclones\r\nacross our plateaus, our mountains, our plains, and our eastern highland\r\nis to know why, and often when, it will be clear or not. To mentally\r\nvisualize the splendid sweep of the elements on their transcontinental run\r\nis to glimpse grandeur in the order of things which will go far to offset\r\nthe petty annoyances of fog or sleet. Ignorance may be bliss, but\r\nknowledge is preparedness.\r\n\r\nThe anticyclone suggests a pyramid of cold, dry air. The cyclone suggests\r\na shallow circular tank in leisurely whirl. But all comparisons are\r\nmisleading and a caution is needed right here. For a storm is not a\r\nwatering cart driven across our united skies by Jupiter Tonans Pluvius. It\r\nis NOT a receptacle from which rain drips until the supply is exhausted. A\r\ncyclone is a much more delicate operation than that. It is a process. It\r\ncan renew itself and become a driving rain storm after it had all the\r\nappearance of being a sucked orange for a thousand miles.\r\n\r\nSuppose that our cyclone, this organization of warm, moist air with its\r\ncurving winds, enters the state of Washington on a Wednesday, from the\r\nNorth Pacific. As early as the Monday afternoon before the wind throughout\r\nall that section of the country would have shifted out of the west and\r\nhave started to blow in some easterly direction,--northeast in British\r\nColumbia and southeast in lower Idaho. But since these winds are blowing\r\nfrom the interior they are dry, and consequently rain does not fall much\r\nbefore the storm center is near, that is on the Wednesday. If the storm\r\ncenter passes north of Tacoma the winds, shifting by south and southwest,\r\nbring in the ocean moisture and heavy rain commences which continues until\r\nthe rising barometer and westerly winds indicate the approach of another\r\nanticyclone. So much for western Washington.\r\n\r\nAs the cyclone passes eastward it mounts the Cascades and its temperature\r\nis lowered, its moisture is squeezed out, and it stalks over Montana, the\r\nmere ghost of its former self, as far as energy and rainfall are\r\nconcerned. To be sure it preserves its essential characteristics of\r\nrelative warmth, and inwhirling winds. But let it continue. As its\r\ninfluence begins to be felt over Wisconsin and the Lake region the moister\r\nair is sucked into the whirl and rain, evaporated from Superior, falls on\r\nMinnesota. The east winds are the humid ones now, the west ones the dry.\r\nEastward the center moves, over Indiana, Ohio, New York, the rainfall\r\nsteadily increasing as the ocean reservoirs are tapped.\r\n\r\nThe first time you tell a New Englander that his easterly storms come from\r\nthe west you are in danger, unless he be a child, for it is to the\r\nchildren that one may safely appeal. Indeed it is the increasing number of\r\nchildren who are learning these fundamental weather facts in the public\r\nschools that the Weather Bureau relies upon for a more intelligent support\r\nin the next generation. They teach their parents. These latter find it\r\ndifficult to believe, however, that the storms which hurl the fishing\r\nfleets upon the coast in a blinding northeaster have not originated far\r\nout at sea, but have come across the continent. For the safe handling of\r\nboats knowledge of the rotary motion of storms is necessary that one may\r\nbe able to tell by the direction of the winds and the way they are\r\nshifting where lies the center of the storm and its greatest intensity.\r\n\r\nIn Tacoma when the wind shifted by way of southeast, south, and southwest\r\nthat was proof that the storm center was passing north of the city.\r\nLikewise if in New York the winds shift by way of northeast, north, and\r\nnorthwest the storm center is passing south of that city. As it drifts out\r\nto sea it is gradually dissipated by the changing influences on the North\r\nAtlantic. Very few of our storms ever reach Europe, although some have\r\nbeen traced to Siberia.\r\n\r\nThe Government has put its sleuths on the track of every storm that has\r\ncrossed the United States in the last thirty years. These weather\r\ndetectives with a thousand eyes have made diagrams of their actions,\r\nmapped their courses, computed their speeds, and if we don't know where\r\nall our discarded storms go to, we at least know where most of them came\r\nfrom and how they acted when with us.\r\n\r\nAbout a hundred and ten areas of low-pressure affect the country during\r\nthe normal year. Of these all but seven, speaking in averages, come from\r\nthe West so that the Boston mechanic who will not believe that the\r\nnor'easter comes via the Mississippi Valley is right about 7/110 of the\r\ntime. But even that small fraction is no exception to the general law,\r\nbecause those seven storms are not born in Newfoundland but in our East\r\nGulf States. They come up the Coast, and the wind blows from the northeast\r\nand north into their centers while they are still on the Carolina coast.\r\nThe great hurricanes which are cradled in the tropics and march westward\r\nunder the influence of the trades are genuine exceptions to the general\r\nwestward rule, although they always eventually turn toward the east. They\r\nwill be given the prominence they demand later, since the eastbound\r\nschedule must not be sidetracked now.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CIRRO-CUMULUS TO ALTO-STRATUS\r\n\r\n_Courtesy of Richard F. Warren_\r\n\r\nThe wispy edges of the cloud at the brightest part are cirrus, the fleecy\r\ncloud at the extreme top is a thin alto-cumulus, and the dark base of the\r\nsky is stratus. But this stratus is too high for that classification and\r\nso they call it alto-stratus. This sky shows that the temperatures are\r\nmoderate, a cold sky being much better packed, and a warm one fluffier.\r\nThe fact that a veil of cirrus has not preceded the heavier clouds argues\r\nthat the coming storm will not be of much consequence. This sort of cloud\r\nbank arising after a period of cold weather is the best possible\r\nprediction of a thaw. Slight rain might follow within a few hours.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThree cyclones a year form over the lower Ohio River basin. On account of\r\ntheir origin over land instead of over water they rarely acquire much\r\nenergy. Once in a decade such depressions deepen rapidly. It was one of\r\nthese Ohio River storms that increased greatly in energy while moving from\r\nWest Virginia to the Jersey Coast that gave Philadelphia her Christmas\r\nBlizzard, a surprise to her citizens and to the Weather Bureau, for most\r\nof the snow fell with the mercury above freezing. The flare-back which\r\ngave Taft his big inaugural snowstorm is another example of the way a\r\ndepression may deepen on approaching the coast. Until the upper atmosphere\r\nis as well understood and watched as the lower, or until instruments are\r\nperfected whereby the weather conditions can be made self-announcing such\r\nsurprises are absolutely unavoidable. Under conditions that warrant any\r\nsuspicion of sudden developments the Bureau at Washington is careful to\r\norder extra observations in the areas likely to be affected, but no\r\nsurface observations can quite suffice.\r\n\r\nFifteen storms a year originate over the west Gulf States, or, drifting in\r\nfrom the Pacific over Arizona and New Mexico begin to acquire energy in\r\nTexas. Twelve are set up over the Colorado mountains. These usually dip\r\ndown into Texas before starting their drive toward the northeast. After\r\nboth these sets of storms get under way they strike resolutely for the\r\nsame locality,--the St. Lawrence Valley. The conformation of the St.\r\nLawrence region provides an irresistible attraction for American storms.\r\nOccasionally a very strong anticyclone holds that territory and pushes the\r\ncyclone off the coast at Hatteras or even makes them drift across the\r\ncountry to Florida. But such occasions are exceptional. Give the ordinary\r\ncyclone its head, and, ten to one, you will find it on the way to the St.\r\nLawrence. The inhabitants will confirm this statement, I am sure. They do\r\nnot feel discriminated against in the matter of weather. They get nearly\r\neverything that is going. Since they have to accommodate from seventy to\r\neighty cyclones in fifty-two weeks they have very little time to brood\r\nover any one variety of weather. With the optimism of that section of the\r\ncountry they say, \"If you don't like our weather, wait a minute.\"\r\n\r\nTen storms a year originate over the Rocky Mountain Plateau, north of\r\nColorado. About twenty cross over from the Canadian Provinces of Alberta\r\nand British Columbia. And all our other storms, about forty each year,\r\nenter our country from the North Pacific by way of Washington and Oregon.\r\nMany of these drift across the northern tier of states without any great\r\ndisplay of energy, at least before they reach the Lake region. But the\r\nmajority loop down somewhat into the middle west as far south as Kansas,\r\nand then make their turn toward the inevitable St. Lawrence. They usually\r\nrequire four days to make the trip from coast to coast by this route, as\r\nalso by the more direct northern route, because on that they travel more\r\nat leisure. But the storms from Texas, whose energy is greatest because of\r\ngreater heat and moisture, occasionally speed from Oklahoma to New York in\r\nthirty-six hours.\r\n\r\nIn summer all speeds are reduced. This is because the disparities in\r\ntemperature are less. In winter where greater extremes of temperature are\r\nbrought into conjunction the processes of the storm are all more violent.\r\nAnd it is a bit disheartening to know that a storm is aggravated to even\r\ngreater endeavors by its own exertions. Its energy provides the conditions\r\nto stimulate greater energy, and, like a fire, it increases as it goes. If\r\nit did not run out of the zone which nourished it and proceed into another\r\nzone where conditions were distinctly discouraging the limits of the\r\nstorm would be much extended, and vast territories would be devastated by\r\nthe self-propelling combination of wind and water.\r\n\r\nTo the generality of us the word storm means rain. To the scientist it\r\nmeans wind. In reality the cyclone is rare that crosses our country\r\nwithout causing rain somewhere along its track. The curiosity of the\r\nWeather Bureau to find out the paths of the storm centers is abundantly\r\njustified because it is along these paths that the heaviest rainfall and\r\nthe severest winds occur. But whether or not there is precipitation on the\r\npath of the cyclone it is rated as a storm if there is a lowering of\r\npressure and consequent wind-shift.\r\n\r\nThe storm centers are not always well-defined, and quite often the\r\ncirculation of the wind about them is not complete. Such cyclones never\r\namount to much, although there is always the possibility of their closing\r\nin and developing a complete circulation with the attendant increase of\r\nenergy. The incomplete cyclones over the desert and plateau regions are\r\nlame affairs, lacking interest and advancing timidly if at all. But once\r\nlet them drift into a locality where they can be supplied with moist air,\r\nthey pick up energy, keep a definite course, and advance with increasing\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nVery often the center will split up, the circulation perfecting itself\r\naround both centers of depression. One of these will likely be over\r\nMinnesota and the other over Texas and the organization will steam-roller\r\nthe states to the east in the manner of a gigantic dumb-bell. This\r\nformation is more likely to have been caused by the two centers appearing\r\nsimultaneously than by a split in an original center. The weather reports\r\ncall this fashion of storm a trough of low pressure. The southern center\r\nis the one that develops the more energy on its turn to the northeast. If\r\nthe two centers should unite on reaching the northeast a very heavy\r\nprecipitation is the invariable result.\r\n\r\nAll cyclones have much greater length than breadth. They frequently\r\nstretch from unknown latitudes in Canada into unrecorded distances into\r\nthe Gulf, while on the other hand it is a very large storm that rains\r\nsimultaneously upon the Mississippi and the Atlantic. Behind a cyclone of\r\npronounced energy a second whirl, called a secondary depression, often\r\ndevelops, in which case the period of wet weather is prolonged. Also, more\r\nrarely, an offshoot forms ahead of the main depression.\r\n\r\nA sluggish, sulky cyclone either in winter or summer provides more\r\nopportunity to humanity for self-discipline than almost any other feature\r\nof our national environment. In winter when the depression slows up it\r\nsettles down upon one community in the guise of fog, and stays by the\r\nlocality until an anticyclone blows in and noses it out. Fog is\r\naggravation, but a hot wave is suffering and the hot wave is caused by a\r\ndepression weak in character but generous in dimensions getting held up on\r\nthe northern half of our country. By its nature it attracts the air from\r\nall sides, and being in the north, the direction of the wind over most of\r\nthe country would be southerly. Air from the west and north has a downward\r\ntendency, but south and east winds are surface currents. Consequently\r\nthese winds, blowing over leagues of heated soil, become dry and parching.\r\nIf the depression lingers long the entire country to the east, south, and\r\nwest soon suffers from superheated air. At last the very intensity of the\r\nheat defeats itself and the reaction to cooler is effected dramatically\r\nthrough a thunderstorm.\r\n\r\nThe well-developed cyclone in winter causes what we all know as a three\r\ndays' rain, although continuous precipitation rarely lasts over ten\r\nhours. The rest of the time is occupied by general cloudiness with\r\noccasional sprinkles and a final downpour as the wind shifts to the west\r\nand the anticyclone nears. In summer the depressions, being shallower,\r\nrarely cause continuous cloudiness for three days, although their\r\ninfluence often lasts as long as that in the guise of a series of\r\nthunderstorms. The line of storms extends several hundred miles,\r\nbombarding all the towns from Albany to Richmond. These thunderstorms\r\nsometimes achieve in an hour or two even greater results than their winter\r\nrelatives can accomplish in three days in the matter of rainfall, wind\r\nvelocity, and general destructiveness. Our wettest months are July and\r\nAugust and not December and January.\r\n\r\nThe freedom of the wind has been the subject of much poetic and prosaic\r\nlicense. As a matter of fact the wind is the veriest slave of all the\r\nelements. It is harried about from cyclone to anticyclone, wound up in\r\ntornadoes, directed hither and thither by changing temperatures. It blows,\r\nnot where it listeth, but where it has to. And circuitously at that. For\r\nonce the path of duty is not straight. That is another fact that the\r\nBoston mechanic would have been slow to accept,--that the wind blows in\r\ncurves. A little consideration, however, of the fact that the wind is\r\nperpetually unwinding in great curves from the anticyclone and winding up\r\non the cyclone will show that nowhere can it be blowing in a perfectly\r\nstraight line.\r\n\r\nThus it becomes the surest indication that a cyclone is to the west of one\r\nif the wind blows from an easterly point. The storm is bound to move\r\ntoward the east, therefore the rapidity with which the clouds move and\r\nthicken will signify when the area of precipitation will reach the\r\nobserver. The cycle of the storm is normally this: After a cloudless and\r\nwindless night a light air springs up from a little north of east. At the\r\nsame time strands of thin wavy clouds appear, very high up. They may be\r\nseen to be moving from the southwest or northwest. Their velocity is\r\ngreat. Their name is cirrus, and they are called mares' tails by the\r\nsailors. They are followed by several hours of clear skies, usually; but\r\nif the storm is smaller and close at hand there is no clear interval.\r\n\r\nBefore the larger storms these cirrus clouds are sent up as storm signals\r\ntwenty-four and even forty-eight hours in advance. The day that intervenes\r\nis very clear, the air feels softer, the temperature is higher. In\r\nmidafternoon more cirrus appears, and as condensation follows the quick\r\ncooling the silky lines increase in number. Beneath them a thicker\r\nformation, known as cirro-stratus, forms a dense bank in the west and\r\nsouthwest. The sun sets in a gray obscurity. If there is a moon it fades\r\nby degrees behind the veil of alto-stratus, and the halo which first was\r\nseen wide enough to enclose several stars narrows until it chokes the moon\r\nin its ever-thickening cocoon of vapor.\r\n\r\nThere is no value whatever in the old superstition that the number of\r\nstars within the halo foretells the number of days that it will rain or\r\nsnow. The same halo that encloses three stars at eight o'clock may have\r\nnarrowed down to one by midnight, or none at all, so that the prophetic\r\ncircle is bound in the very nature of its increase to contradict itself.\r\nThe presence of a halo is a pretty sure sign of some precipitation within\r\ntwenty-four or thirty hours. It fails about thirteen times in a hundred.\r\nIf the halo is observed around the sun it is an even surer sign, failing\r\nonly seven times the hundred.\r\n\r\nDuring the time of cloud-increase the wind will probably lull before a\r\nsnow, so that the hour or so before precipitation begins is one of intense\r\nbrooding calm. Or if there is no calm the wind, now easterly, will be very\r\ngentle. Soon after the precipitation begins the wind will begin to\r\nfreshen and will continue to increase in velocity until the center of the\r\nstorm is close to the locality. This will require about eight hours for\r\nthe average storm. As storms vary an average is a very misleading thing\r\nand the best way to judge of the length and severity of the storm is by\r\nwatching the wind. If it increases gradually the storm will be of long\r\nduration. If the wind rises fitfully and swiftly it will not likely be\r\nlong but may be severe. If the wind reaches any considerable velocity\r\nbefore the rain or snow begins the storm is sure to be short and severe.\r\n\r\nThe color and formation of the clouds will tell when the precipitation is\r\nabout to begin. In summer, no matter how striking and black are the shapes\r\nand shadows of the clouds, rain will not fall until a gray patch, a\r\nuniform veil called nimbus is seen. In the little showers of April this\r\npatch of unicolored cloud is there, as well as behind the great arch of\r\nthe onrushing thunderstorm. In winter raindrops are smaller and the\r\ntendency of the clouds is to appear a dull, uniform gray at all times. But\r\nthe careful observer can detect a difference between the nature of the\r\nclouds several hours before precipitation and their color immediately\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nWhen snow is about to fall no seams are visible. An impenetrable film\r\nobscures all the joints. From such a sky as this snow is sure to fall. But\r\nif seams are visible, if parts of the skyscape are darker than others,\r\nthen, no matter whether the temperature on the ground is below freezing a\r\nrain storm will ensue. Very often these winter rains begin in snow or\r\nsleet, but the clouds register the moment when the change from snow to\r\nrain is to be made. The presence of swift-flying low clouds from the east\r\nis a certain sign that the change to a temperature above freezing has been\r\neffected in the upper strata of the atmosphere. This variety of cloud is\r\ncalled scud, and accompanies rain and wind rather than foretelling it long\r\nin advance.\r\n\r\nIf the storm is approaching from the southwest the precipitation begins\r\nnear the coast about twelve hours after the cirrus clouds commence to\r\nthicken and about twenty-four after they were first seen. In some\r\nlocalities as much as thirty-six and even forty-eight hours are sometimes\r\nrequired for the east wind to bring the humidity to the dew-point. Just a\r\nlittle observation will enable one to gauge the ordinary length of time\r\nrequired to bring things to the rain-pitch in one's own country. Of course\r\nno two storms in succession make the trip under the same auspices and\r\nwith the same speed. The sign of the Universe should be a pendulum.\r\nOne period of cyclone, anticyclone, cyclone will traverse the country\r\nrapidly. Then there will be a halt all along the line, and the next\r\nseries,--anticyclone, cyclone, anticyclone, will take three days longer to\r\nmake the crossing. Otherwise our weather would have a deadening\r\nregularity.\r\n\r\nOn an average our storms cross the country at the rate of about six\r\nhundred miles a day. This is the average. Some delay, linger, and wait for\r\ndays over one locality. Others do a thousand miles in the twenty-four\r\nhours. They thicken up enough to cause rain from two hundred to six\r\nhundred miles in advance of their centers. It stops raining not long after\r\nthe actual center has passed.\r\n\r\nBut for picnic purposes the storm is far from being over. For even though\r\ncontinuous raining has stopped the low pressure still induces a degenerate\r\nsort of precipitation called showers, or oftener mist for another twelve\r\nhours (usually in winter). Then as the cooling influence of the\r\nanticyclone approaches the rain recommences. This time it is not for long,\r\nhowever, and is followed by permanent clearing, the wind shifting into the\r\nwest. Sometimes the change to blue sky is abrupt. But if the subsequent\r\nanticyclone is not very well defined, cloudy conditions may linger for a\r\ncouple of days. Such clouds are usually much broken and show white at the\r\nedges and never cause more than a chilly feeling.\r\n\r\nThis attempt to outline the customary cycle of the storm,--clear sky,\r\ncirrus cloud, wind-shift to the east, the denser cirro-stratus, the\r\npavement-like stratus, the woolly nimbus, the first continuous hours of\r\nrain, the misty interval, the windshift to the west, the final shower, and\r\nbreaking cloud, the all-blue sky--this storm-schedule is always subject to\r\nchange. But the fundamentals are there in disguise every time. They only\r\nhave to be looked for and there is some satisfaction in penetrating the\r\ndisguise.\r\n\r\nWhen a storm comes up the Atlantic Coast, as happens a few times a winter,\r\nthe process is shortened, because the effects of the larger easterly\r\nquadrants are felt only at sea. The most prominent recent illustration of\r\nthis type of storm was the severe snowstorm that swept the coast states\r\nfrom Carolina to Maine the Saturday before Easter, 1915. Its calendar read\r\nas follows: Friday, 8 P. M., cirrus clouds thickening into cirro-stratus.\r\nMidnight, stars faintly visible, wind from northeast, 12 miles an hour.\r\nSunrise, stratus clouds, wind rising in gusts at Philadelphia to 30\r\nmiles; 8 A. M., rapid consolidation of clouds with snow shortly after,\r\nalthough the temperature at the surface of the earth was as high as seven\r\ndegrees above the freezing point. This rapidly dropped to freezing. Flakes\r\nwere irregular in size. Until one o'clock in the afternoon the snow\r\nthickened with gusts of wind up to forty miles. Snowfall for five hours\r\nwas 14 inches, an unprecedented fall for this locality.\r\n\r\nThen the storm waned for five hours more, 5 inches more of snow falling.\r\nPrecipitation practically ceased at 6 P. M. By sunrise on Sunday the skies\r\nwere free of clouds and the wind blew gently from the northwest.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a high pressure area out at sea and beyond the ken of the\r\nWeather Bureau causes one of these coast storms to curve inward to the\r\nsurprise of everybody. Occasionally, too, the transcontinental storms are\r\ndriven north or south of their accustomed paths. While the divergence may\r\nbe slight, it causes a margin of variance from the accuracy of the\r\nBureau's report. Then arises a second storm,--one of indignation--from all\r\nthe people on one side of the strip who carried umbrellas to no purpose,\r\nand from the others,--who didn't.\r\n\r\nThis pushing aside of the cyclone is caused by pressure variation that\r\nonly hourly reports from many localities could detect. Vast hidden\r\ninfluences shift the weights ever so little and the meteorological express\r\nis wrecked. But this happens, at most, fifteen times in a hundred, and\r\nremembering the unseen agencies to be coped with people are refraining\r\nmore and more from the tart criticisms of former times, not in charity but\r\nin justice, although there is small tendency yet to forward eulogies to\r\nthe Bureau in recognition of the eighty-five times it is right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSKY SIGNS FOR CAMPERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weather-wise, even more so than poets, are born. But that only goes to\r\nsay that weather-wisdom can be fathered. For poetry and canoeing and the\r\nart of making fires, once the desire for these things is born, may be\r\naided infinitely by observation and practice. Nobody can teach a man the\r\nsmell of the wind. But the chap who feels nature beating under his heart\r\ncan, by taking thought, add anything to his stature. So it is with those\r\nwho are called weather-wise. An unconscious desire, a little conscious\r\nknowledge, a good deal of experimentation with the cycle of days, and you\r\nhave a weatherman.\r\n\r\nThese chapters aim to put the little conscious knowledge into the hands of\r\nthe people with the unconscious desire, so that when they take their week\r\nin the woods for the first time (and their month for the second time) they\r\nmay enjoy the shifting scenery of the sky-ocean and, incidentally, a dry\r\nskin. For I take it that everybody will soon be camping. Maine and the\r\nAdirondacks have become a family barracks. It is Hudson Bay for bachelors.\r\nAnd over this expanse of woods and children the weather problem ranks with\r\nthe domestic one. For naturally if a soaking would endanger his vacation\r\nthe husband must not permit a rain,--unexpectedly. In all seriousness, it\r\nis of avail to know the skies if one is going into the wilds just as it is\r\nof avail to know what severed arteries demand, what woods burn well, and\r\nwhat mushrooms can be eaten, even though one can get along without knowing\r\nthese things until perchance the artery is severed or the arched squall\r\ncatches one far from shore.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, one grain of weather wisdom prevents a mush of\r\ndiscomfort. And if, fellow-camper, the following observations gathered on\r\na thousand thoughtless walks do not tally (for the northeastern states)\r\nwith yours, write me, so that in the end we may finally contrive together\r\na completer handbook of our weather.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLOUDS\r\n\r\nClouds are signposts on the highway of the winds. Every phase of the\r\nweather, except stark clearness, is commented upon by a cloud of some\r\nsort. When danger is close they thicken. When it passes they disappear.\r\nThe aviators of the future will be cloud-wary. He who flies must read or\r\nnever fly again.\r\n\r\nThe cirrus cloud is always the first to appear in the series that leads up\r\nto the storm. It looks like the tail of Pegasus and for it the old\r\nforecasters in their forecastles made a special proverb.\r\n\r\n    \"Mackerel scales and mares' tails\r\n    Make lofty ships carry low sails.\"\r\n\r\nThese white plumes and scrolls which are in reality glistening ice-breath,\r\nfly at the height of five, six, seven, and even eight miles. And as a sign\r\nof coming storm they are about as infallible as anything may be in this\r\nerratic world. They were born in the cradle of a storm. The storm center\r\nwas breathing warmed air upward to great heights, and although the disc of\r\nthe storm itself was only two or three miles deep, its nucleus,\r\ncrater-like, shot warm columns twice as far. With just enough moisture\r\ncontent to make a showing against the blue these streamers flowed to the\r\neastward. At those dizzy heights the prevailing westerlies are in full\r\nforce, blowing from eighty to two hundred miles an hour night after night\r\nand day after day. These westerlies caught the storm exhalations, the\r\nstreamers, and hurled them eastward at greater speed than the main body of\r\nthe storm. And that is the reason that we see these cirrus clouds always\r\neight, mostly twelve, often twenty-four and sometimes forty-eight hours\r\nbefore the storm is due.\r\n\r\nJust a few strands of cirrus have little significance. They may be\r\ncondensation from a local disturbance, or a back fling from a past storm.\r\nBut if the procession of the cirri has some continuity and broadens to the\r\nwestern horizon it is a sign about eight times in ten that a cyclone is\r\napproaching. Occasionally the storm center is too far to the south or\r\nnorth to cause rains at your locality, but the cirri bank up on the\r\nhorizon and their lacework covers the sky. If they appear to be moving\r\ntoward the region of greatest cloudiness it is not a sign of\r\nprecipitation. This condition is most apparent at Philadelphia when the\r\nstorm center over Alabama or Mississippi floats out to sea by way of\r\nFlorida without having the energy to turn north. Then the cirrus is seen\r\nthickly on our southern horizon. Looking closely one sees that the cirri\r\nare moving from the northwest, and are being drawn into the storm area\r\ninstead of proceeding in advance of it.\r\n\r\nCareful watching will sometimes enable one to tell whether the tails are\r\nincreasing or decreasing in size. If they dissolve it means that the\r\ncyclone from which they were projected is losing strength because of new\r\nconditions. Cloudiness may follow but no precipitation of consequence. The\r\nplumy tails are expressive: pointing upward they mean that the upward\r\ncurrents are strong and rain will follow; pointing downward they mean that\r\nthe cold dry upper currents have the greater weight and clear weather is\r\nlikely. In summer the cirrus cloud formations are not such certain advance\r\nagents of rain because all depressions are weaker and less able to\r\nconfront a well-intrenched drought. As the proverb goes, \"all signs of\r\nrain fail in dry weather,\" and there is some truth in it.\r\n\r\nThe fine wavy cirrus clouds often increase in number, develop in texture\r\nuntil the blue sky has become veiled with a muslin-like layer of mist.\r\nThis is the cirro-stratus, and is a development of the cirrus, but it does\r\nnot fly so high. Its significance is of greater humidity and is the first\r\nreal confirmation of the earlier promise of the cirri. Another form that\r\nthe cirro stratus may assume is the mackerel sky,--clouds with the light\r\nand shade of the scales of a fish. If this formation is well-defined and\r\nfollowing cirrus it is a fairly accurate storm indicator. It is not quite\r\ninfallible, however, as the same forms may be assumed when the process is\r\nfrom wet to dry.\r\n\r\nThe old proverb, \"Mackerel sky, soon wet or soon dry,\" expresses this\r\nuncertainty. If dry is to follow the scales will appreciably lessen in\r\nsize and perhaps disappear. If the cirro-stratus or scaly clouds are\r\nfollowed by a conspicuous lowering it is only a question of a few hours\r\nuntil precipitation begins. The cirro-stratus at a lower level is called\r\nalto-stratus and this becomes heavy enough to obscure the sun.\r\n\r\nThe cloud process from stratus on is slow or rapid, depending upon the\r\nenergy of the coming storm and the rate of its approach. In most cases the\r\nclouds darken, solidify, and become a uniform gray, no shadows thrown, no\r\njoints. Soon after the leaden hues are thus seamless the first snowflake\r\nfalls. If it doesn't it is a sign that the process of condensation is\r\nhalting: the storm will not be severe. Sometimes there is no precipitation\r\nafter all this preparation, but under these circumstances the wind has not\r\nventured much east of north. From the time that the snow starts the clouds\r\nhave chance to tell little. Only by a process of relative lightening or\r\ndarkening can the progress of the storm be followed and the wind, and not\r\nthe clouds at all, is the factor to be watched; for occasionally the sun\r\nmay shine through the tenuous snowclouds without presaging any genuine\r\nclearing so long as the wind is in the east.\r\n\r\nBut in summer the clouds become even more eloquent than the wind. The\r\nrain-cloud, called the nimbus, becomes different from the dull winter\r\nspectacle. In summer air becomes heated much more quickly and the warm\r\ncurrents pour up into the cold altitudes where they condense into the\r\nmarvelous Mont Blancs (or ice-cream cones) of a summer afternoon. These\r\npiled masses of vapor are cumulus clouds, and if they don't overdo the\r\nmatter are a sign of fair weather. They should appear as little cottony\r\npuffs about ten or eleven in the morning, increase slowly in size, rear\r\ntheir dazzling heads and then start to melt about four in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the upward rush of warm, moist air has been so great in the\r\nmorning that the afternoon cooling cannot dispose of it all without\r\nspilling. Then occurs a little shower,--the April sort. Often in our\r\nmountainous districts it showers every day for this reason. The great\r\nthunderstorms come for greater reasons: they are yoked to a low pressure\r\narea and represent the summer's brother to the winter's three-day storm.\r\n\r\nCumulus clouds are called fair weather clouds until their bellies swell\r\nand blacken and they begin to form a combination in restraint of sunlight.\r\nEven then it will not rain so much out of the blackness as out of the\r\ngrayness behind it, and if there is no grayness chances are that you will\r\nescape a wetting. One can almost always measure the amount of rain that is\r\nimminent by the density of the curtain being let down from the rear of the\r\ncloud. If you can see the other clouds through it or the landscape the\r\nshower will be slight. If a gray curtain obscures everything behind it you\r\nhad better pull your canoe out of the water and hide under it if time is\r\nless valuable than a dry skin. Such showers may be successive but rarely\r\ncontinuous.\r\n\r\nRain clouds have been observed within 230 yards of the ground. Very often\r\nit can be seen to rain from lofty clouds and the fringe of moisture\r\napparently fail to reach the earth, because the condensation was licked up\r\nand totally absorbed on entering a stratum of warmer air. The reverse of\r\nthis occurs on rare occasions;--condensation takes place so rapidly that a\r\ncloud does not have time to form, and rain comes from an apparently clear\r\nsky. This phenomenon has been witnessed oftenest in dry regions and never\r\nfor very long or in great amounts, although a half hour of this sort of\r\ndisembodied storm is on record.\r\n\r\nIf the cumulus clouds of the summer's afternoon do not decrease in size as\r\nevening approaches showers may be looked for during the night. And if the\r\nmorning sky is full of these puffy little clouds the day's evaporation on\r\nadding to them will probably cause rain. A trained eye will distinguish\r\nbetween a stale and fresh appearance in cloud formation, the light, newly\r\nmade, fresh clouds, like fresh bread, contain more moisture. If the clouds\r\nhave much white about them they need not be feared as rain-bearers. Clouds\r\nare much higher in summer than in winter and the raindrops of warm air are\r\nlarger than those of cool.\r\n\r\nIf cumulus clouds heap up to leeward, that is, to the north, or northwest\r\non a south or southwest wind a heavy storm is sure to follow. This is\r\nnotably so as regards the series of showers in connection with the passage\r\nof a low-pressure area. The wind will bear heavy showers from the south\r\n(in summer) for a whole morning and half the afternoon with intervals of\r\nbrilliant sky and burning sun. Or perhaps the south wind will not produce\r\nshowers, but all the time along the northwest horizon a bank of cloud\r\ngrows blacker and approaches the zenith, flying in the face of the wind or\r\ntacking like a squadron against it. About the time that the lightning\r\nbecomes noticeable and the thunder is heard the wind drops suddenly, veers\r\ninto the west, and the face of things darkens with the onrush of the\r\ntempest.\r\n\r\nAlthough no rain may have fallen while the wind was in the southern\r\nquarter yet that constituted the first half of the storm and the onslaught\r\nof rain and thunder the second. While the storm area moved from the west\r\nto the east the circulation of air about the center was vividly\r\ndemonstrated by the south wind blowing into the depression, whose center\r\nwas epitomized by the moment of calm before the charge of the plumed\r\nthunderheads from the northwest.\r\n\r\nMost camping is done either in hilly or mountainous country where the\r\nmovement of clouds is swifter and more changeable than over flat lands.\r\nThere is one sign of great reliability: if the mountains put on their\r\nnightcaps the weather is changing for the wetter, and if clouds rise on\r\nthe slopes of the hills or up ravines, or increase their height noticeably\r\nover the mountain-tops, the weather is changing for the dryer. In the\r\nmountains where abrupt cliffs toss the winds with all their moisture to\r\nheights that cool clouds form and condense rapidly and the weather changes\r\nquickly. But even in the mountains the big changes give plenty of warning.\r\n\r\nOften clouds may be noticed moving in two or even three directions on\r\ndifferent levels at once. The upper stratum will probably be cirrus from\r\nthe west. Cumulus or stratus may be floating up from the south. A light\r\ndrift of vapor called scud may fly on the surface easterly wind. Such a\r\nconfused condition of wind circulation betokens an unsettled system of air\r\npressures and as frequent collisions of the air bodies at varying\r\ntemperatures are inevitable rains, probably heavy, will follow.\r\n\r\nOn clear days one will be surprised to see isolated clouds, usually the\r\ntorn, thin sort, drifting across the sky from the east. A change will\r\nfollow soon.\r\n\r\nIn winter black, hard clouds betoken a bleak wind.\r\n\r\nClear winter days several times a season show a brilliant blue sky filling\r\nwith great cumulus clouds of dark blue, blurred at the top and gray at the\r\nbase. They will sprinkle snow in smart, short flurries, and are ushering\r\nin a period of clear and much colder weather.\r\n\r\nA sky full of white clouds and much light is a cheerful sign of continuing\r\nfair weather.\r\n\r\nThe softer the sky the milder the weather and the more gentle the wind. It\r\nis the dark gloomy blues that bring the wind. But do not mistake the\r\nwoolly softness of the rolling clouds before a thunderstorm. A sudden and\r\noften violent gust follows. Tumbling clouds in any event should make one\r\nwary of venturing on water. Summer drownings would not be so numerous if\r\nthe portent of the squall were heeded.\r\n\r\nTo this data might be added many singular cloud formations that are not\r\nobserved often. The funnel shaped cloud of the tornado, the green shades\r\nof the hurricane cloud, the green sky of cold weather showing out between\r\nlayers of steel blue, coppery tints that show before heavy storms\r\nsometimes, variations of color at sunset each of which has a meaning which\r\npractice in deciphering will make clear. But enough has been given to show\r\nsky-searchers how many are the tips of coming weather that may be read\r\nfrom a conglomeration of fog particles. Nobody with eyes should be caught\r\nunawares by day. The look of the sunset shadows forth much of the coming\r\nnight. And throughout all this truth holds: the greater the coming storm\r\nthe longer and clearer are the warnings given to the watchful.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WINDS\r\n\r\nThe wind is the ring-master of the clouds. It whistles and they obey.\r\nTherefore to be windwise is to be weatherwise, almost.\r\n\r\nOne can get a hold on the wind by learning to gauge its strength. Look at\r\nthe trees or the smoke from your city chimneys and guess how fast it blows\r\nat eight o'clock in the morning, or eight at night. The weather report the\r\nnext day will tell you how nearly you were right.\r\n\r\nBeginning is easy; anybody can guess a calm. When the leaves are just\r\nmoving lazily the Weather Bureau calls it a light or gentle breeze, moving\r\nfrom 2 to 5 miles an hour. A fresh breeze, from 6 to 15 miles will stir\r\nthe twigs at first and finally swing the branches about. From 16 to 25\r\nmiles, a brisk wind, will cause white caps on the lakes, tossing the tops\r\nof the trees, but breaking only small twigs. Increasing from 26 to 40\r\nmiles it becomes a high wind that breaks branches on trees, wrecks signs\r\nin the towns, causes high waves at sea and roars like the ocean in heavy\r\nsqualls through the woods. From 40 to 60 miles an hour makes a gale.\r\nSailing craft are now in danger. The pressure at 50 miles an hour is 13\r\npounds to the square foot, having risen from three-quarters of an ounce at\r\n3 miles. This pressure becomes 40 pounds per foot when the wind reaches a\r\nvelocity of 90 miles.\r\n\r\nAt 60 trees are uprooted, chimneys may go, it is difficult to walk\r\nagainst, the noise becomes very great but rather inspires than frightens.\r\nAs the gale increases from 60 to 80 (which velocity the Bureau rather\r\nweakly calls a storm wind), danger rapidly increases. Trees are\r\nprostrated, the uproar becomes terrifying, walking without aid is\r\nimpossible, the great ocean liners are in danger, the sea becomes a\r\nwhitened surface of driving spume that heaps up into piles of water thirty\r\nor more feet high, windows are blown in and frame houses cannot stand much\r\ngreater velocities. Anything from 80 miles an hour up is well called a\r\nhurricane. Everything goes at 100. At Galveston the machine that\r\nregistered the wind velocity blew away at 100.\r\n\r\nThey have better instruments now, and in many places velocities of over a\r\nhundred miles an hour have been recorded. As high as 186 miles was\r\nregistered on the top of Mt. Washington, and in a single gust 110 at\r\nMontreal. The great hurricane winds are most felt at a few of the exposed\r\nplaces on our coasts. Cape Mendocino, on the Pacific, has 144 miles an\r\nhour to its credit in a January hurricane. But enough destruction is done\r\nat 90 miles. Fields are stripped of their crops, or leveled; houses are\r\ndemolished unless they are specially built, like the New York\r\nsky-scrapers, to withstand much higher velocities. In the small whirling\r\nstorms called tornadoes the wind is estimated to reach a velocity of 200\r\nto 500 miles, and nothing but the cyclone cellar will shelter one from the\r\nfury of the elements when they are really unleashed.\r\n\r\nThe higher one goes the greater the velocity of the wind. On the top of\r\nMt. Washington 100 miles is rather common for hours at a time and 150 is\r\nrecorded now and then. That is only 6000 feet above Boston. If such a\r\nforce struck Boston for a minute it would be blown _en masse_ into the\r\nBay.\r\n\r\nVelocities on land are less than those at sea, because of the resulting\r\nfriction from obstacles. Velocities in summer are lower (thunder gusts\r\nexcepted) than in winter. Since the wind is caused by differences in\r\natmospheric pressure, and that in turn by disparities in temperature,\r\nwinter holds the palm for greater velocities because the wide whirl of a\r\ncyclone over the great plains may cause to mix air from Texas with a\r\ntemperature of 60 degrees with air from Montana of 30 degrees below zero,\r\nwhile the summer temperatures in both states might easily be 80 degrees.\r\n\r\nThroughout most of our land certain winds have always the same bearing\r\nupon the weather and this correspondence is roughly the same over most of\r\nthe country. West winds, for instance, are an almost universal guarantee\r\nof clear weather. The Pacific Coast and western Florida are the\r\nexceptions.\r\n\r\nNorthwest winds bring clear skies and cool weather everywhere. In winter\r\nin the north plateau section heavy snows arrive in advance of the severe\r\ncold waves that come on these northwest gales.\r\n\r\nNorth winds are the cold bearing ones. Clear skies prevail under their\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nNortheast winds are cold, raw snow-bearing winds in winter and spring and\r\nbring chilly rains in midsummer.\r\n\r\nEast winds are the surest rainbringers of all for the eastern two-thirds\r\nof the country, and are soon followed by rain with a shift of wind over\r\nthe other third. Their temperatures are more moderate than those of the\r\nnortheast storms.\r\n\r\nThe greatest falls of rain occur, however, with the southeast winds, whose\r\nmoisture content is greater than that of the others because they are\r\nwarmer and blow off water except in Rocky Mountain districts.\r\n\r\nSouth winds are warm and contain much moisture, which falls in showers\r\nrather than in continuous rains.\r\n\r\nThe southwest winds of winter precede a thaw and are much damper than west\r\nwinds. In summer over much of our country they are hot, parching winds\r\nthat injure vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe average velocity of the wind from these different quarters is variable\r\nin different parts of the country, the severest being on the southeast and\r\nnorthwest quadrants. The highest winds are always where the steepest\r\ngradients are; that is, where the barometric pressure decreases or\r\nincreases the fastest. The steepest gradients are usually on the northeast\r\nand northwest sides of the storm center, with the exception of the\r\nAtlantic Coast where the southeast winds are often highest. The average\r\nfor the northeast quadrant is 16 miles, for S. E. 30, for S. W. 20, and\r\nfor the N. W. 30 miles an hour. But averages can deceive. As a matter\r\nof fact single instances of great wind velocities occur from each point of\r\nthe compass. The greatest velocity ever recorded at Philadelphia occurred\r\nin October, 1878, when the wind blew seventy-five miles an hour from the\r\nsoutheast. But the record velocities for eight of the other months were\r\nregistered in the northwest quadrant.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALTO-STRATUS\r\n\r\n_Courtesy of Richard F. Warren_\r\n\r\nNot so high as cirro-stratus, and yet partaking of the same skeiny\r\ntexture. This would be a normal sky in winter about six hours after the\r\nveil of cirrus had begun to throw its haze about the sun. No other cloud\r\nformations appear, however, and so the area of precipitation is still\r\npretty far away. In summer such a sky is less common. If the disturbance\r\nis to amount to anything the cirro-cumulus will soon form. If the wind is\r\nfrom a westerly quarter the blanket of cloud is doubtless a drift from\r\nsome distant storm, which will not affect this locality. The wind is\r\nalways blowing toward a storm and away from clear weather.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe period of time when the barometer is beginning to rise after having\r\nbeen very low is that when the strongest winds blow.\r\n\r\nSome sections of our country have special kinds of wind that are\r\npeculiarly their own, notably Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana where the\r\nchinook reigns. This phenomenon belongs only to the cold season and only\r\nto the coldest days of it. It is a warm wind that begins to blow without\r\nmuch warning from the southern quarter. It is caused by a body of cold air\r\nsuddenly falling from a great height. As it falls its descent heats it and\r\nit causes a rise in the temperature of the surrounding locality that\r\ngreatly exceeds any rise from other causes. The increase in temperature\r\nwill be as much as forty degrees in fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nThis sudden dry heat is a great snow-eater. If it were not for the chinook\r\nthe snow-blanket would stay so much longer on the cattle ranges that they\r\nwould be useless as such. In northeastern sections of our country and\r\nCanada the warm winds blowing in from the ocean at the approach of a\r\ncyclone do away with the snow rapidly but with nothing like the speed of\r\nthe chinook.\r\n\r\nAnother phenomenon of the air that is of tremendous benefit to man is the\r\nsea-breeze. During the intense heat of a hot wave the wind may shift to\r\nthe east in Boston and in fifteen minutes coats are comfortable. Such a\r\nshift may bring relief to a strip of land two hundred miles wide along our\r\nentire eastern seaboard. The sea-breeze is explained by the fact that the\r\nland cools more quickly than the sea and also warms more easily. During\r\nthe whole forenoon of a summer's day the sun has been pouring upon land\r\nand sea, but the land-air has become much hotter than the air over the\r\nsea. It rises and the sea-air rushes landward. By midnight the land has\r\ncooled off even more than the sea and the heavier air now presses out to\r\nsea again. On every normal day this balancing process takes place.\r\n\r\nIf it doesn't conditions are abnormal and chances are that mischief is\r\nbrewing. This ebb and flow of warmer and cooler air is, on a small scale,\r\nexactly what is happening on a vastly larger field of operations between\r\ncyclone and anticyclone. And it is the dominance of the anticyclone with\r\nits prolonged rush of air from the northwest that interrupts the sea\r\nbreeze for two or three days in winter, as the cyclone prevents the night\r\nland breeze from taking place when it is central off the eastern coast.\r\n\r\nThe exchange of air between mountain side and valley is similar to the\r\nland-and-sea breeze. The rarer air on the mountain side heats faster by\r\nday and cools faster by night than the denser air in the valley. Therefore\r\nduring the day it rises and the valley air rushes up to take its place;\r\nduring the night it cools and sinks into the valley. This is a great help\r\nwhen one is shut up in a secluded valley for several days and cannot get a\r\ngood view of the skies. The atmosphere is acting properly and will remain\r\nsettled so long as the air blows up your ravine for most of the day, and\r\nturns about sundown and blows out and down the ravine like a flood of\r\nrefreshing water.\r\n\r\nOf course many valleys are so large as to be affected, not by these local\r\ncauses, but by the larger movements of the anticyclones when the\r\nsure-clear west wind may blow up the valley for three days at a time. But,\r\nnevertheless, for most mountainous places the logic holds and you may\r\nexpect rain if the wind does not blow coolly down the ravine at night. Of\r\ncourse watch your clouds for confirmation.\r\n\r\nIn times of calm prepare for storm. An eminent meteorologist has frowned\r\nupon me for saying that. It is not the whole truth, I admit, but there is\r\na certain kind of calm which happens often enough to justify the remark.\r\nIt happens this way. A severe storm has passed. The customary anticyclone\r\nwith its brisk northwest winds has arrived and is blowing with all the\r\nvigor necessary to induce one to believe that the clear weather is to\r\ncontinue for the usual length of time; that is, three or four days. But\r\nsuddenly in the early afternoon, just when it should be blowing its\r\nhardest, the wind drops, lulls, shows a tendency to change its direction.\r\nThere is only one explanation. Another cyclone has developed off in the\r\nwest. It has knocked the anticyclone on the flank, taken the teeth out of\r\nthe gale.\r\n\r\nThe wind shows this before clouds can. The absence of wind when there\r\nought to be a lot shows it before even the first cirrus swims overhead.\r\nThe chance is that when the flow of anticyclonic air has been thus rudely\r\ncut off and stillness follows, it will be storming by morning. It is best\r\nto keep an eye on these abnormal, precipitous calms. In times of peace\r\nprepare for rain.\r\n\r\nBut the eminent meteorologist was eminently right when he said that the\r\nstatement was misleading unless explained. For there are many kinds of\r\ncalms that do not portend coming storms. Nearly every day, winter and\r\nsummer, but particularly in summer, the wind drops to a calm at sunset.\r\nThat is a time of adjustment. After sunset when the accounts are all in\r\nthe wind springs up with as much force as it had in the afternoon and\r\ncontinues until dawn. At sunrise, however, there is another truce. If this\r\ntruce is neglected either at sunrise or at sunset it is a sign that either\r\na cyclone on an anticyclone is very much in the ascendency. These truces\r\nare most often observed at the seashore when you are out sailing and the\r\nsmell of supper fills your nostrils but is not sufficient to fill your\r\nsails. These calms are normal and the best sign of a fair day on the\r\nmorrow, provided the other signs agree.\r\n\r\nDuring the great transition period from summer to winter comes that\r\nautumnal truce, Indian Summer, which is the chief claim to fame of\r\nAmerican weather. For day after day a brooding haze sleeps in the air,\r\nsometimes for weeks there is no wind of any strength. Winter advances\r\ninsidiously in the fall but retreats in commotion, and the cooling off\r\nprocess permits of these still days while they are uncommon in the spring.\r\nThe wind checks off more mileage in March than in any other month.\r\n\r\nWhile the regular day's end calm and the calm of the year's exhaustion\r\nmean continued fair weather, there is one calm that everybody knows, which\r\nis the most dramatic moment in the whole repertory of the weather: the\r\nforeboding, ten-count wait before the knockout blow of the thunderstorm.\r\nBut when that calm comes every one is already sitting tight so that it is\r\nnot much account as a warning. They say that the intense stillness before\r\nthe hurricane strikes is uncanny.\r\n\r\nWhether inshore or afloat the wind is to be watched if you would know what\r\nweather is to be. It is only another of Nature's paradoxes that the most\r\nunstable element should be the most reliable guide of all on the uncertain\r\ntrail of the next day's weather.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURES\r\n\r\nConsidering that the temperature of the sun is 14,072 degrees Fahrenheit\r\nand the temperature of space is absolute zero, 459 degrees below ours, we\r\ndo very well on earth to be as comfortable as we are.\r\n\r\nAnd we owe it all to the atmosphere which keeps the sun from concentrating\r\nupon us. Our place in the sun is so very small that we intercept only\r\none-half of one billionth of the heat which it is giving off night and\r\nday. But that is sufficient to do a lot of damage if it could get at us.\r\n\r\nBut even the paltry range of temperatures so far recorded on our\r\nplanet,--from 134 degrees above zero one day in California, to 90 degrees\r\nbelow zero one night in Siberia,--is by no means a fair statement of the\r\nextremes we are called upon to bear. Only twice a decade in our country\r\ndoes the mercury vary as much as sixty degrees in twenty-four hours, and\r\nthere are vast areas where the daily change amounts to only a few degrees.\r\n\r\nThe changes that do come so suddenly to us, particularly in winter and\r\nthat are known as cold waves, are in reality beneficial. To them we\r\nAmericans may owe our energy, our vivacity, our changeability of mood. The\r\nrefrigerated, revivified air sweeping down from the north is tonic. It is\r\nheavy, and issuing from antiseptic altitudes, drives the humid,\r\ngerm-nursing air from our city streets. If we had arranged a process of\r\nrefreshment like this at vast expense we should have been intensely proud\r\nof it. As it is we are intensely annoyed at it and occasionally a few\r\npeople are frozen to death. The Weather Bureau warnings and the coal clubs\r\nare reducing the loss in property and lives.\r\n\r\nIf you are sleeping out it is of great importance to know when the mercury\r\nis going to take one of these swoops, for sleeping cold means little real\r\nrest because one's muscles are tense, and the next day's packing needs all\r\nthe relaxation one can get. Two generalizations govern pretty much every\r\nchange of temperature: the mercury will rise before a storm and it will\r\nfall after one, winter and summer, but much more conspicuously in winter.\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons for this. Our cyclones usually cross our country\r\nover such a northern track that over most of the country the air drawn\r\ninto them comes from the southern quarters and is therefore warmer than\r\nthe air previously flowing from the anticyclone. Also the process of\r\nprecipitation causes heat. This is true to such an extent on the coast of\r\nIreland where it rains most of the time that a scientist has computed that\r\nthe inhabitants get from one-third to one-half as much heat from the\r\nrainfall as they do directly from the sun. Thus a normal storm is doubly\r\nsure to warm up the environment.\r\n\r\nIn summer the reverse is partially true, for very often the rain does not\r\nbegin until the actual center of depression has passed and the west winds\r\nhave begun to exercise their cooling influence. So that in summer we have\r\na sultry, sunny day as the first half of the storm area and then a cooling\r\nshower. Also after two or three days of warm weather in spring and autumn\r\nwe have a rainstorm of the winter type which lowers the temperature\r\ninstead of raising it. This is because the heat produced by the storm is\r\nless than that of the sun's rays intercepted by the clouds. The clear\r\nskies of the preceding anticyclone had permitted the land to warm up very\r\nfast under the midsummer sun, and the clouds of the cyclone, by cutting\r\noff the supply, had made a relative chill.\r\n\r\nIn winter the sunrays are so much feebler because of their slant and\r\nradiation proceeds so rapidly under the dry air of the anticyclone that a\r\nmuch greater degree of cold is produced than when the cyclonic clouds\r\nprevent the radiation. Therefore the rainy area is the warmest of all.\r\nEven in summer the winds from the southeast, south, and southwest are\r\nwarmer than those from the opposite quarters, not only because they blow\r\nfrom a quarter naturally warmer on account of the sun, but because they\r\nare surface winds and have absorbed some of the heat from the soil. Being\r\ndenser, they absorb it more readily and hold it longer.\r\n\r\nThe change, then, from the period of fair weather to that of storm brings\r\nan increase of temperature. But the rate of increase varies. The faster\r\nthe storm is approaching the faster the temperature will rise; and the\r\nroute of the storm's center makes all the difference as to the amount of\r\nthe rise. If the wind shifts by way of the north and holds in the\r\nnortheast until precipitation begins the rise in temperature will be very\r\nslight. The great snowstorms of the northern half of the country occur\r\nunder just such a circumstance. If the wind shifts by way of the north but\r\ngets around to the east or even southeast before the precipitation starts\r\nthe rise in temperature will be more pronounced, as much as thirty degrees\r\nsometimes in a few hours, and the winter storm that started in as snow\r\nsoon changes to sleet and rain.\r\n\r\nIf the wind shifts by way of the south and then into the southeast the\r\nrise will be vigorous and the storm will likely be a comparatively warm\r\nrain. If the wind shifts only so far as the south the rise will be highest\r\nof all and blue sky will often appear between the showers, showing that\r\nthe air is heated to a considerable height.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the temperature changes from the maximum of the cyclonic\r\narea to the minimum of the anticyclone is also dependent upon the wind. If\r\nthe storm center is passing south and the wind begins to pull into the\r\nnortheast and north the temperature will fall steadily and slowly. The\r\nrain or snow often cease gradually by the time the wind has reached the\r\nnorth, but the temperature continues to fall slowly until it reaches very\r\nlow levels in mid-winter. If the storm center is passing north of you the\r\nwind which has brought most of the rain while it was in the southeast with\r\ncomparatively high temperatures swings into the southwest, the temperature\r\nfalls somewhat.\r\n\r\nThere is usually a final downpour and a rapid shift of the wind into the\r\nwest or northwest, but almost never directly into the north. The\r\ntemperature falls several degrees in a few minutes, quite unlike the\r\ngradual decline of the northeast-by-north shift, and clear skies come at\r\nonce with rapidly diminishing temperatures. In the vicinity of\r\nPhiladelphia a fall of twenty-five degrees would be most unusual on the\r\nnortheast shift,--such storms reaching 38 degrees and falling to 15,\r\nwhile with the other shift a fall from 55 degrees to 15 would not be\r\nunusual. Of course any one set of figures given could only show the\r\ntendency and not the rule or limits.\r\n\r\nAfter the manner of the wind-shift the intensity of the storm is a good\r\ngauge of the temperature change to be expected by the camper. As a rule\r\nthe greater the intensity of the storm the greater will be the degree of\r\ncold that follows it. The storms that have a complete wind circulation\r\nabout them are always more severe than those with incomplete circulation\r\nand are invariably followed up by some reduction in temperature. If the\r\ndecrease is not proportionately great and the subsequent wind has only a\r\nmoderate clearing quality look out for another cyclone.\r\n\r\nIn such a case the temperature is the best witness of the contemplated\r\nchange. For instance, after a summer thunderstorm a decided coolness is\r\n_de rigeur_. If this does not occur it means nearly every time that there\r\nis another thunderstorm in process of construction. There may be not a\r\ncloud in the sky, there may be no wind (although there should be) so that\r\nthe course of the thermometer is the only means of telling what is to be\r\nthe next event. Anybody can take a thermometer with him although a\r\nbarometer--the most accurate forecaster of all--may be thought too much\r\nexpense and bother.\r\n\r\nAt some future date the Weather Bureau will be able to predict the\r\ntemperature of seasons in advance. This, together with the amount of rain\r\nscheduled to fall, will be an invaluable aid to everybody and to the\r\nfarmers most of all. At present mild seasons that have severe storms\r\nwithout the appropriate degree of cold after them cannot be entirely\r\nexplained, let alone being prediscovered. They all hinge upon the more or\r\nless permanent areas of high and low air pressure over the oceans and\r\ninternational meteorological service has not progressed far enough to\r\nsupport many ocean stations as yet.\r\n\r\nSometimes clear weather may intensify, growing brighter, stiller, colder.\r\nThis is because the pressure is increasing. Cold seasons are distinguished\r\nusually by a succession of anticyclones. There is no way of telling how\r\nlong a certain spell of cold weather is to last, but I have noticed that\r\nthe same characteristics rarely predominate for longer than a month at a\r\ntime. In other words, if December has been warm and rainy, January will\r\nlikely be cold and dry. Of course, that is precisely the unscientific sort\r\nof generalization which the Bureau very rightly frowns upon, but which\r\none may nurse privately until science has provided a substitute as she\r\nalready has in so many instances.\r\n\r\nWith a little practice it is an easy matter to estimate the temperature to\r\nwithin a very few degrees. Try guessing for a few mornings and then look\r\nat the thermometer. You will hit within three degrees every time after a\r\nweek of this.\r\n\r\nAllowance must be made for the amount of moisture in the air and for the\r\nforce of the wind. Damp air feels colder by several degrees than crisp,\r\ndry air, and a breeze increases the difference still more. Air in motion\r\nis not necessarily colder than calm air. As a matter of fact the lowest\r\ntemperatures of all are recorded about sunrise after a still, clear night.\r\nThe amount of radiation accomplished during the last hours of the night is\r\namazing, and the downward impetus of the thermometer is often carried on\r\nfor an hour or more after the sun has appeared above the horizon. A\r\nself-recording thermometer is an amusing toy which will show this and\r\nbecomes a valuable instrument if one raises fruit.\r\n\r\nIn winter three o'clock of an afternoon sees the highest temperature\r\nusually, and in summer this maximum occurs as late as half-past five, due\r\nto the fact that the sun can pour in its heat faster than the earth can\r\nradiate it off. For the half hour before and after sunset, particularly in\r\nwinter, the loss of heat is relatively greatest; then the pace slackens\r\ntill three or four in the morning, when the plunge of the mercury is\r\naccelerated until the rays of the rising sun counteract the radiation.\r\n\r\nIf the mercury does not rise appreciably on a clear winter's day it is a\r\nsign that a cold wave is stealing in, due, doubtless, to a gradual\r\nincrease in pressure without its customary bluster. Very often snow\r\nflurries predict its approach, but this may be so gradual that only the\r\nrestriction of the daily thermal rise may indicate it. By the next morning\r\nthe temperature will likely be twenty degrees colder.\r\n\r\nIf the mercury does not fall on a clear winter's night it is a sign that a\r\nlayer of moist air not far above the surface of the earth is checking the\r\nnormal night radiation. Unsettled weather is almost sure to follow unless\r\nthis wet blanket is itself dissipated and the mercury takes its customary\r\ntumble before morning.\r\n\r\nIf the temperature falls while the sky is still covered with clouds\r\nclearing, possibly after a little precipitation, will soon follow.\r\n\r\nHot waves approach insidiously. A night will not cool off as it properly\r\nshould, the sun will rise coppery, and while the day is yet young\r\neverybody begins to realize that all is not exactly right. But the heat\r\nincreases usually for several days, not only by reason of steadily\r\nlowering pressure, but also by accumulation. Finally when a climax is\r\nreached it departs abruptly on the toe of a thunderstorm.\r\n\r\nA cold wave reverses the process. It arrives abruptly on the heels of a\r\ndeparting cyclone and, after losing power, steals away without any\r\ncommotion whatever. Its rate of progress is in close relation to the\r\ncyclone ahead of it.\r\n\r\nOur mountains play a great part in our weather. They are a right arm of\r\nProvidence to our agricultural communities. Due to their north and south\r\ntrend a cold wave of any severity reaches the Pacific Coast only once a\r\ngeneration. Just once has snow been observed to fall at San Diego and it\r\nis so rare south of San Francisco that many people never have seen a\r\nflake. East of the mountains the belt of desert makes natural crops\r\nimpossible for a thousand miles, but if they crossed the continent all the\r\nterritory north of them would have such a cold climate that none of the\r\npresent enormous crops of Canada and our northern states could possibly be\r\ngrown. It is also due to the wide insweep of winds from the Gulf that\r\nthe plains states are so well watered.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUMULUS\r\n\r\n_Courtesy of Richard F. Warren_\r\n\r\nThe tops of cumulus are irregular, looking like wool-packs; the bases are\r\nflat. The true cumulus shows a sharp outline all the way round. Its shape\r\nis in constant change due to the strong winds it is encountering. It is\r\ncaused by the swift uprush of warm air on a sunny day. This cloud is a\r\nsign of fair weather, because the base is not large, compact, or dark\r\nenough to threaten rain and its comrades are also disjointed. If the\r\ncumulus grow darker toward the horizon and increase toward evening a\r\nsquall is likely.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn lesser fashion the Appalachians protect the Atlantic seaboard. They\r\nwithstand the impact of the cold waves to a great extent, although they\r\nare not high enough to divert the flow of cold air entirely toward the\r\nsouth and it is not desirable that they should. As things are the cold\r\nstrikes Alabama before it hits New Jersey, and is often more severe there.\r\n\r\nComparative cold is often registered by the green color of the sky. A\r\nfiery red continues the prevailing heat.\r\n\r\nThe day that is ushered in by a fog, in summer, will likely be warm,\r\nproviding the fog lifts by ten o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of a night with even a thin covering of clouds will be a\r\ngood deal higher than if the sky is clear. In the British Isles the whole\r\ndifference between freezing and no freezing lies with the fairness of the\r\nheavens. Everywhere frost will not form while the sky is covered, although\r\nthe temperature may be below the freezing point. In summer radiation on a\r\nstill clear night may be so rapid that frost may follow a temperature of\r\nfifty degrees at nightfall.\r\n\r\nThe temperature at the surface of the earth may easily deceive, as a\r\ncolder or warmer stratum of air may overlie that immediately next to the\r\nground. I have seen water particles fall when the temperature was as low\r\nas 16 degrees above zero, showing that the stratum of cold air was very\r\nthin. Our sleet storms in which immense damage is done to trees and\r\ntelegraph wires occurs from just such a situation,--a cold, shallow layer\r\nof air close to the earth, with the warm moisture-bearing air flowing over\r\nit. The reverse of this situation is not uncommon--the sight of a\r\nsnowstorm proceeding merrily along with the ground temperature at 35 or\r\neven 40 degrees.\r\n\r\nComing warmth may be noticed by the increase in size of snow flakes, with\r\nfinally hail and rain. Coming cold is foreshadowed by hail mixed with the\r\nrain and lastly snow flakes which have a tendency to decrease in size.\r\nColors of the clouds predict temperature changes, but it takes much\r\npractice to distinguish the cold, hard grays from the soft, warm ones. A\r\nwarm sky is always less uniform in color than a cold one. The colors of\r\nwinter sunsets are, as a rule, much brighter than those of summer skies.\r\n\r\nThe stars seem brighter on a night that is to be cold. If they twinkle it\r\nis because of rushing air currents, and if the wind is from the northwest\r\nthe result may be a subsequent lowering of temperatures.\r\n\r\nThe whole question of whether it will be colder and how much is vital to\r\nthe camper and if the signs of change are taken along with the look of the\r\nclouds and the direction of the wind he need never be wrong as to the\r\ndirection the mercury is going, and will soon be able to guess the\r\ndistance pretty fairly.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAIN AND SNOW\r\n\r\nEast of the Mississippi River rain falls with the utmost impartiality upon\r\nevery locality. Thirty to fifty inches are delivered at intervals of three\r\nor four days throughout the year. And if there is a slight irregularity in\r\ndelivery one can be sure that from 125 to 150 of the 365 days will be\r\nrainy. Occasionally there is a more or less serious hold up of supplies,\r\nbut this rarely happens in the spring of the year and never happens to all\r\nsections at once. And if there is a desire to make amends for the drought,\r\nwe have what we call a flood and blame it on the weather instead of on our\r\nprecipitous denudation of the watersheds.\r\n\r\nWest of the Mississippi particular people have to go to particular places\r\nfor their rain. If they like a lot of it they must go to the coast\r\ndistricts of Washington or Oregon where they can have it almost every day.\r\nIt rains a good deal at Eastport, Maine,--about 45 inches a year; that is,\r\nnearly an inch a week,--but at Neal Bay, Washington, at about the same\r\nlatitude, in one year it rained 140 inches, and it never stops short of\r\n100 inches any year.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the Washington people are tired of it they need only\r\nescape to Arizona where it rains about two inches a year, and they can\r\nlive in an enterprising hotel down there whose manager believes that it\r\npays to advertise the sun. He guarantees to provide free board on every\r\nday that the sun doesn't shine.\r\n\r\nIn the plateau section enough snow falls every year to store up enough\r\nwater for irrigation purposes, and the little rain that falls arrives in\r\njust the right season to do the most good, the spring. In California what\r\nthe farmers lose in amount they make up in the regularity of its arrival.\r\n\r\nNorth of the Ohio River most of the precipitation from November to April\r\nis snow. About 50 inches of it falls on the average over this tremendous\r\nterritory. And it is more useful than rain,--the handy blanket that makes\r\nlumber-hauling easy, that keeps the ground from freezing to Arctic\r\ndepths, that fertilizes the soil, and that acts as a great reservoir,\r\nholding over the meat and drink of the vegetable kingdom till the thirsty\r\ntime arrives. In upper Michigan and Maine the average depth becomes 100\r\ninches. Averages are very misleading when snowfall is being considered,\r\nsome winters producing very scanty amounts and others heaping it on to the\r\ndepth of 185 inches once at North Volney, New York.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Ohio the depth varies from substantial amounts in some\r\nwinters to almost nothing in others. Snow has been observed, however, in\r\nevery part of our country except the extreme southern tip of Florida. Once\r\nand only once on the records a great three-day snowstorm visited all of\r\nsouthern California, extending to the Mexican border and to the coast.\r\n\r\nThe strip of country between the parallels of New York City and Richmond\r\ncomprises the section wherein each winter storm is one large guess as to\r\nwhether the precipitation is to be snow or rain. A compromise is usually\r\naffected in this way. Before the clouding up began the mercury may have\r\nstood at ten degrees below zero. As soon as the wind acquired an easterly\r\nslant the temperature increased. As it neared the freezing point the snow\r\nwould begin, first in flakes of medium size which would enlarge until\r\nafter a particularly heavy fall of a few minutes they would at once almost\r\ncease. Hail soon would succeed, the mercury still rising, and often the\r\nhail would have turned to rain before the freezing point of the air of the\r\nimmediate surface of the earth had been reached, turning the snow already\r\non the ground to slush and making a holiday for germs.\r\n\r\nOne can always tell when this change to warmer is about to occur because\r\nthe clouds which have been part and parcel with the obscuring snow\r\nsuddenly show, not lighter but darker. The sudden increase in size of the\r\nflakes is another infallible symptom of increasing warmth in the\r\natmosphere for each large flake is a compound of many smaller ones. When\r\nthe temperature is low the flakes are very small, being grains and\r\nspicules in the severe blizzards of the west and falling as snow-dust in\r\nthe Arctic. In the heavy storms of the guessing-belt the flakes are not\r\nnecessarily small.\r\n\r\nI have noticed (in the latitude of Philadelphia) that our largest storms\r\nbegin very leisurely indeed with small and regular-sized flakes. A quarter\r\nof an inch may not fall in the first hour. As the center nears the snow\r\ncomes ever faster and larger, but not large, flakes are mixed with the\r\noriginal-sized flakes. Snow dust is apparent. At the height of the storm\r\nflakes of all sizes except the very large are falling, denoting great\r\nactivity in the strata of air within the storm influence. In the ordinary\r\nstorm an accumulation at the rate of an inch an hour denotes a storm of\r\nconsiderable intensity.\r\n\r\nThe snow will likely keep on falling as long as the flakes are irregular\r\nin size. If they grow large and few or very small a cessation is likely,\r\neven though the wind is still blowing from an easterly quarter. The amount\r\nof snow likely to fall can be gauged not only by the process of\r\nflake-change but by the rate at which the wind rises. A storm's intensity\r\nis measured by the amount of wind. A storm can be a storm without a drop\r\nof rain or flake of snow if only there be enough wind. And as long as the\r\nwind in a snowstorm keeps rising the storm is likely to go on, probably\r\nincreasing in volume of precipitation.\r\n\r\nIf the wind shows a tendency to edge around to the southeast there is\r\ndanger of the snow turning to rain; if the wind veers slowly to the\r\nnortheast the temperature will fall slowly and the rate of precipitation\r\nwill likely increase for a while. In such instances the snow does not\r\ncontinue to fall after the wind has swung west of north. Often clearing\r\ntakes place with the wind still in the north or even a point east of\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nContrary to superstition snow may begin to fall at any hour of the day or\r\nnight. But certain hours seem more propitious than others, owing no doubt\r\nto the tendency of cooling air to condense. Three o'clock of an afternoon\r\nand eight o'clock in the morning are favorite times, the one being the\r\nhour of a winter afternoon when cooling is begun, the other the hour when\r\nthe coldest time is reached and condensation likely if at all. Of course,\r\none remembers storms beginning at nine, ten, eleven, and every other hour.\r\n\r\nStorms that begin in the morning seldom reach much activity before three\r\no'clock in the afternoon, while those that begin then quickly increase in\r\nintensity as evening draws near and the sun's warmth is withdrawn from the\r\nupper air-strata. More snow falls at night than in the daytime, also. Snow\r\nis more delicate than rain and perhaps more responsive than rain to the\r\nsubtle changes of the atmosphere. Possibly there is no ground on the\r\nBureau records for these ideas, possibly storms have a tendency to start\r\nfrom the Gulf on their northeastward journey and so reach Philadelphia\r\noftener at one time than another. I would like my notions confirmed that\r\nsnowstorms increase at nightfall, and that they prefer to start operations\r\nat sunrise and about sunset.\r\n\r\nFor the camper the snowstorm need have no terrors. It gives a long warning\r\nof its approach. It comes mostly without destructive winds. Its upholstery\r\nprotects and warms the walls of one's tent. It adds beauty to the leafless\r\nwoods, interest to the trailer, and a hundred amusements among the hills.\r\n\r\nBut the value of snowy weather is not only measured by its beauties and\r\ncommercial uses. There is another way: make it read character for you.\r\nWatch the reactions toward the first snowfall of half a dozen kinds of\r\npeople. It will show you what they are; give you a very fair measure of\r\ntheir youth.\r\n\r\nOur atmosphere contains a lot of moisture that never gets precipitated.\r\nYou can prove this on any warm day by noticing the way the atmosphere acts\r\ntoward a glass of ice-water. When the air of the room is much warmer than\r\nthe surface of the glass it surrenders its moisture willy nilly. Sometimes\r\nthis condensation is enough to cause a miniature rainstorm that trickles\r\ndown the outside of the tumbler. If a small cold surface can wring so much\r\nwater out of a little air it is small wonder that we get an inch or so of\r\nrain from vast currents of air at unequal temperatures.\r\n\r\nTry to visualize the process. A stream of vapor has been warmed and is\r\nascending. A mile up and it has cooled not only by the reason of altitude\r\nbut also by the process itself. About each little dust-particle in the\r\nsurrounding area vapor forms--vapor cannot form without something to form\r\non, there being always enough dust from deserts and volcanoes to go round.\r\nIf the cooling proceeds the tiny globules enlarge and as they increase in\r\nweight they settle and fall. Falling, they unite with others.\r\n\r\nIf the air-strata are very warm and thick the drops may grow to a very\r\nconsiderable size. We see these in the middle of our great winter rains\r\nwhen the insweep of southern winds with all their warmth and moisture is\r\nvery extensive. Also the first few drops that come from the thick, hot\r\nlips of the thundercloud are usually immense.\r\n\r\nThe best way to measure the size of a raindrop is to have it fall in a box\r\nof dry sand. It rolls up the sand and measurements can be easily and\r\naccurately made. But the most interesting way is to let the first drops of\r\nthe thunderstorm fall upon a sheet of blotting paper. If the same sort of\r\nblotting paper is used the measurements will be of just as much importance\r\nfor comparison. Circles as big as teacups are formed sometimes.\r\n\r\nHeavy drops in winter mean a heavy fall, because they denote high\r\ntemperatures which are uncommon and are bound to be followed by\r\nconsiderable condensation as the cooling proceeds back to normal\r\ntemperatures. Small drops in summer mean either cooler weather, or sudden\r\ncondensation. Small drops in winter are a sign of very thin\r\nmoisture-bearing strata, or low temperatures, indicating that the rain\r\nwill be light, protracted, and liable to change to snow.\r\n\r\nHail is frozen rain. Winter hail is small and harmless and rarely falls to\r\nany depth because the exact temperatures that bring forth the hail rarely\r\ncontinue for very long at a time. Hail in winter is merely the stepping\r\nstone to either rain or snow. But in summer hail is a serious matter. It\r\nshows that there is a violent disturbance of the atmosphere in progress.\r\nVertical air currents, probably abetted by electricity,--the authorities\r\nare not sure--often carry the stones up several times. They take on layer\r\nafter layer, coalesce, and sometimes fall the size of eggs, apples, or any\r\nother fruit, barring melons. The usual summer hail does not exceed the\r\nsize of a robin's egg. Even a projectile of that size, however, falling\r\nfor a half mile or more has a tremendous destructive power. Greenhouses\r\nsuffer, birds are killed, cattle stunned, and loss of life has been known\r\nto follow. In August in 1851 in New Hampshire hailstones fell to the\r\nweight of 18 ounces, diameter 4 inches, circumference 12 inches. In\r\nPittsburgh stones weighing a full pound have crashed down, and in Europe\r\nwhere many destructive storms have occurred there are official records of\r\neven greater phenomena. The lightning accompanying these hailstones is\r\nusually very severe. A flake or ball of snow forms the nucleus of a\r\nhailstone.\r\n\r\nIf a thundercloud looks particularly black or if it can be seen in\r\ncommotion think of hail and seek shelter. It is pretty difficult to\r\npredict exactly when hail is going to fall in summer. It is a possibility\r\nwith every large storm, but a probability with only a very few during the\r\nsummer. It accompanies tornadoes.\r\n\r\nIn winter hail falls before a rainstorm, even when the ground temperature\r\nprecludes the possibility of snow; some lingering stratum of cold air has\r\nensnared the drops on their way down.\r\n\r\nSnow is not frozen rain. It has an origin of its own. It is born in a\r\ntemperature consistently below freezing and on the condensation of the\r\ninvisible moisture becomes visible as a tiny crystal. These infinitesimal\r\ncrystals unite and form larger, hexagonal shapes, elongated or starry.\r\nThey are wafted along, sinking, all slightly differing one from another,\r\nalthough forming a few types. These types have been photographed and\r\ncatalogued and very often the altitude from which the snow is coming may\r\nbe learned from their shape and design. But this branch of science is\r\nyoung yet and confusing and the outdoor man has surer signs of the\r\nvicissitudes of the storm, in the general size of the flakes, the power\r\nand direction of the wind, the clouds and temperature. The possibilities\r\nof flake-study as a means of forecasting are many and of value as is\r\nanything that tends to unveil the secrets of the greater heights.\r\n\r\nSnowflakes are so light that after the storm processes are over and the\r\nsun has come out the residue may still float lazily to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe wild disorder of the snow flurry will only last a few minutes and\r\nnever leave much snow on the ground.\r\n\r\nSnowstorms that come on the wings of the west wind may be severe, but they\r\nwill be short. They are unusual in the east, but sometimes the heaviest\r\nsnows of the western states come on the sudden cooling that follows the\r\nshift to west.\r\n\r\nSnowstorms arriving on a high wind last only a few hours.\r\n\r\nSnowstorms that are long in gathering and increase to considerable\r\nintensity continue a long while.\r\n\r\nThose that follow a sudden clouding up are of no importance.\r\n\r\nThe snowstorms that leave on a high wind from the west or northwest are\r\nfollowed by a cold wave. Those that continue after the storm wind has died\r\naway are succeeded by calm, clear, and usually warmer weather.\r\n\r\nIn northern districts a snowstorm may be looked for after a period of cold\r\nweather. In middle districts if the cold has been severe the reaction to\r\nwarmer may bring rain instead. In such cases generalities are of no use,\r\nand the possibilities must be determined by the man on the spot. The best\r\nconditions for snow through the middle districts are occasioned by an area\r\nof low-pressure with its attendant precipitation crossing the southern\r\nhalf of the country while the northern half is under the influence of an\r\narea of high-pressure with its attendant frigidity. The cold air flows\r\ninto the southern storm with the result that the middle districts get the\r\nnorthern quadrants of the storm which are the usual snow-bearing ones\r\ninstead of the southern rain-bearing quadrants that they would have got if\r\nthe center of the storm had pursued its usual course up the Ohio and down\r\nthe St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\nIf the storm has two centers, one over Texas and the other over Montana,\r\nas is so frequently the case in winter, the subsequent high pressure will\r\ncome too late to affect the temperature of the zone of precipitation and\r\nthe latter will likely be rain in the middle districts. Sometimes the\r\ncyclones cross the country on the Canadian border and enough warm air is\r\nsucked over the line to give the inhabitants of Montreal a thaw and rain.\r\nThis happens to them only once or twice a winter. And even more rarely a\r\ncyclone over the Gulf with an anticyclone above it will give the Gulf\r\nStates a taste of winter, but rarely more than a few flakes.\r\n\r\nIt really all depends on the influx of air, its rate and direction. It\r\nrains in Alaska and snows in Georgia on the same day merely because at one\r\nplace the air is coming off the Pacific, and at the other it is flowing\r\nfrom the center of a refrigerated continent.\r\n\r\nAnd the progress of these storms is one of Nature's greatest poems if you\r\ntake a minute to think of them sweeping on in majesty, the one thing that\r\nman cannot control. Even the snow which is the citizens' curse as well as\r\nthe farmers' blessing becomes epic when it beleaguers an empire for half a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEW AND FROST\r\n\r\nThe very process that made the tumbler of ice-water sweat on the hot day\r\ncauses dew. And the formation of frost is analogous to that of snow. Frost\r\nis not frozen dew, but the formation of moisture crystals at the\r\ntemperature of 32° or below. Frost or dew form only on still, cloudless\r\nnights. Even if no clouds are visible, neither will form if a stratum of\r\nhumid air has prevented radiation. Hence either dew or frost is a fairly\r\ngood sign of clear weather.\r\n\r\nThree white frosts on successive mornings are followed by a rain. This\r\nsaying holds water not because there is any virtue in frost to cause rain,\r\nbut because a storm is normally due once a week. The frosts did not form\r\nwhen the anticyclonic winds were blowing and usually not more than three\r\nmornings elapse between the time that the anticyclone has lost its\r\ninfluence and the time for the next cyclone to appear. Frost indicates a\r\nconsiderable amount of moisture in the atmosphere, also, which tends to\r\nincrease as the cyclone approaches.\r\n\r\nThe heaviest dews come in late summer and the heaviest frosts in\r\nmid-autumn because the change in temperature is greatest then and there is\r\na greater chance that there will be a calm at sunrise. The greatest frost\r\ndamage occurs in the spring because the tenderer crops are growing then.\r\nSummer frosts used to occur in the northern parts of Minnesota and along\r\nthe southern boundaries of the inland Canadian provinces before the\r\nforests were cleared off. The march of civilization has actually pushed\r\nback the frost line some distance.\r\n\r\nFrost may occur when the amount of humidity in the air is low and the\r\nbarometer rising at any temperature under 50 degrees at nightfall, the\r\nclear skies permitting radiation enough under those circumstances to\r\nproduce the necessary cooling. An evening temperature of 40 degrees with\r\nthe clear skies and faint west breeze will almost surely produce a frost,\r\nprovided the wind drops. In such circumstances the only hope for the\r\nfarmer is that there is enough humidity in the air to cause a fog before\r\nthe frost-point is reached. A temperature touching 34 degrees would not\r\nbring frost, however, if the sky was at all overcast. Frost is difficult\r\nto predict because a night shift in the wind, cloudiness that forms after\r\nmidnight, or even a wind arising before the coolest period at dawn will\r\nprevent its formation. On the other hand, clouds may disperse, the wind\r\nmay fall or radiation may be so rapid before sunrise as to cause a killing\r\nfrost unawares. The farmer who lives in areas disputed by winter and\r\nspring may never be quite sure, but precautions should be taken on the\r\nstill, clear, dry nights with the thermometer at fifty or below.\r\n\r\nFruit-growers resort to fires or to coverings to protect their crops. The\r\nfires are particularly worth while, not so much for their heat which at\r\nbest cannot be expected to warm up the great outdoors much, but for the\r\nsmoke which prevents radiation. A line of smudges such as campers use to\r\nward off the mosquito would spread a pall of smoke over an orchard\r\nefficaciously. A snowstorm, the soft fluffy sort that falls in April or\r\nMay, can do much less damage to vegetation than a severe frost.\r\n\r\nTemperatures are much lower on the ground than even six feet above the\r\ngrass. Naturally these temperatures are those that really influence most\r\nvegetation and in England temperatures on the grass are given in the\r\nweather report with the ordinary observations, being as much as six or\r\neight degrees lower on clear nights.\r\n\r\nIn some of the hot, dry countries, such as Arabia and Egypt, most of the\r\nmoisture that they receive falls in the form of dew. Falls, of course, is\r\na loose expression as the dew forms and does not fall, being different\r\nfrom the minute particles of fog. The fog particles in suspension in the\r\nair are estimated to be as small as 1-180th of an inch. When they grow to\r\n1-80th of an inch in diameter they commence to fall. Fogs are chiefly\r\ncaused by the soil being warmer than the air above it; the vapor on rising\r\ncondenses and becomes visible. In the spring and fall currents of air blow\r\nover rivers at different temperatures and the result is a fog. One does\r\nnot have a fog in the desert.\r\n\r\nThere are places in the ocean with cold and warm currents with the air\r\nabove them correspondingly different where fog is of almost constant\r\noccurrence. The Gulf Stream off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland has a\r\ntemperature of 78 degrees, while the water on the Banks is 45 degrees so\r\nthat fogless days are rare along the line of meeting.\r\n\r\nFrost is known in every part of our country, many localities in the\r\nplateau section being exposed to it every month of the year. The thin air\r\nand cloudless skies of the altitudes make radiation very easy and the\r\ndaily variation of temperature is much wider than along the humid coasts.\r\nThose who have never looked into frost conditions throughout our country\r\nwill be surprised to read the warnings of the Weather Bureau.\r\n\r\nFrom the station at Pensacola, Florida (frost-proof Florida!), comes this\r\nstatement: \"Vegetables are subject to damage by frost during all seasons\r\nof the year.\"\r\n\r\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, \"Frost is likely to damage fruit or other crops\r\nin May and September.\"\r\n\r\nPhoenix, Arizona, \"Frost is likely to do damage in December, February, and\r\nMarch.\"\r\n\r\nBaker City, Oregon, \"Fruit and other crops are most liable to damage by\r\nfrost in April, May, June, September, and October.\"\r\n\r\nKalispell, Montana, \"Frost damage for fruit, May 15th to July 10th; for\r\ngrain, June 25th to August 1st.\"\r\n\r\nMontgomery, Alabama, \"During March, April, and May fruit and early\r\nvegetables are subject to damage by frost.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THUNDERSTORM EXPOSED\r\n\r\nProbably nothing in the world causes more terror than a flash of\r\nlightning. In an able-bodied thunderstorm playing about a city there are\r\nseveral dozen flashes, and every one of them brings trepidation, fright,\r\nor positive terror to thousands of human beings,--oftenest women,\r\nsometimes men, and occasionally children. Yet probably there is no alarm\r\nin the world so ill-founded.\r\n\r\nThunderstorms play pretty generally over our three million square miles\r\nwith their hundred million population. Yet lightning picks out of this\r\ncrowd only three hundred people a year who are foolish enough to be\r\nkilled. That is, only three persons in each million to be sacrificed to\r\nthe most astounding and beautiful display in the world, a mere handful\r\ncompared to the mounds of motor car victims or to the 33,068 deaths a year\r\nattributable to railroads and the perils of track-walking.\r\n\r\nThe trouble about the thunderstorm is that it does not lull one into the\r\nsense of insecure repose. It is too obviously after one. If the thunder\r\nwere toned down a bit and the lightning a trifle duller the alliance might\r\nclaim its thousands, like the inconspicuous housefly, and never meet an\r\nobjection. But until the thunderstorm foregoes its bravado it will\r\ncontinue to bully the ladies into hysterics.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is always the sporting chance that you are one of the\r\nthree in your particular million to perish.\r\n\r\nBut you can lessen the chance. You must not seek refuge under a tree. You\r\nshould not take doubtful shelter in a barn. And you had best not sit in a\r\ndraft by an open window if there is a tree just outside it. By these three\r\navenues most of the thoughtless three hundred (a year) invite their end.\r\n\r\nTrees that are tall and otherwise exposed are struck oftenest. The\r\nelectricity in the cloud and the electricity in the earth are always\r\nendeavoring to combine. When this tendency becomes so strong that the\r\nresistance of the intervening air is counteracted the electric discharge\r\nbetween thundercloud and earth takes place. This happens most frequently\r\nfrom some pointed thing as a steeple, a tree if they are good conductors.\r\nMen and animals are sometimes charged with the electricity opposite to\r\nthat of the cloud. When the lightning is discharged, even at a distance,\r\nthe bodies revert rapidly from the electric to the natural state. This\r\nreturn shock or concussion occasionally proves fatal.\r\n\r\nThat is the reason that trees are such poor protectors from the storm's\r\nfury. Better a wet skin in the middle of a field than precarious dryness\r\nunder an oak or cherry or tall pine or almost any other tree. If it should\r\nhail hard enough to stove in your head take to a beech or a small spruce.\r\n\r\nBarns are struck so often because the body of warm, dry air in them favors\r\nthe passage of electricity. Those who hide in barns are sometimes\r\ncremated. After a severe thunderstorm in the Poconos I have seen as many\r\nas three barns on fire at once.\r\n\r\nOpen windows, porches, and exposure generally are safe, but not safest.\r\nThe cellar, that old stamping ground, is where instinct takes a few. Any\r\nclosed room on the side of a house away from trees is good enough. But the\r\nrisk of annihilation is so very small that one is repaid for taking it by\r\nthe spectacle. A great thunderstorm surpasses anything in nature in the\r\nmatter of architecture, coloring, directness, and surprise,--which, with\r\nselection, comprise the essentials of art. Imagine the crowds that would\r\npay to wonder at the sight if a thunderstorm could be staged, say, at the\r\nHippodrome!\r\n\r\nSome hot morning, if you have time to watch, you may see a thunderstorm\r\nborn in the mountains. The warm, moist air flows up the mountainside and\r\nthe essential start is made. Cooling, this air first shows as a fluffy\r\ncloud that soon grows harder in appearance and becomes tufted at the top.\r\nIts little belly swells and grows blacker. It hovers over the valley.\r\nOthers add to it. Suddenly a sort of adolescent thunder is heard. The\r\ntension has become too great. A definite consolidation is visible, a\r\nfringe lowers, and a few drops of rain may reach you.\r\n\r\nThe incipient storm moves off, and having started a whirl within itself,\r\nincreases, like a rumor, as it goes. Before it has moved beyond your\r\nhorizon it may have become a large patch of dark blue with billowy white\r\ncrests on the top, and underneath hangs a curtain of rain. Chances are\r\nthat it will not go far before encountering conditions that dispel it, but\r\nit may cover half a dozen counties before nightfall. As a rule these\r\nlittle heat thunderstorms do not amount to a great deal. They are\r\noriginated by local conditions and leave things pretty much as they found\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut when a cyclone is passing in summer a series of thunderstorms or heavy\r\nshowers with some thunder frequently take place instead of the all day\r\nwinter rain. These thunderstorms mount up against the wind. Their clouds\r\nare black. The word black is an indulgence of the human weatherman\r\nmeaning, of course, any dark color,--a black sky would terrify the most\r\nhardened of meteorologists.\r\n\r\nThe cyclone winds come from the south or southeast just as they do in\r\nwinter, but this quarter may not bring the heaviest rainfall in summer.\r\nThere may be showers or even clear skies, but the day will be humid and\r\nhot. A haze of cirro-stratus cloud will gradually overspread the sky from\r\nthe west, darkening into a blue from the original whitish or gray.\r\nLightning does not appear from the cirrus, but after the sky has grown\r\npretty dark a ridge or tumbled cloud will be seen low on the western\r\nhorizon. Meanwhile the wind will have died down.\r\n\r\nThe lightning, at first only a faint glimmer, will have become more\r\nfrequent and noticeable. If it is striking at a distance of fifteen miles\r\nthe thunder will not be heard. As soon as the storm center, where the\r\nheaviest rain and the electrical display are taking place, gets within the\r\nfifteen-mile radius thunder will be heard to growl, and the tumbled\r\ncumulus clouds which may have lain along the horizon for hours will begin\r\nto approach. The storm will be upon you in ten minutes likely after the\r\narc of foreboding blue and white cottony cloud has begun its charge across\r\nthe sky. Light quickly fades from the heavens. The wind drops entirely.\r\nStreaks of lightning burn downward.\r\n\r\nBehind the arc stretches a curtain of uniform blue or gray. If the gray is\r\nlighter in places the rainfall will not be heavy. If the curtain is a\r\nuniform blue a heavy rain is sure. If the bow of clouds can be seen to\r\ntumble or is continuous and approaches fast the wind is certain to be\r\nsevere,--may be from 30 to 60 miles an hour for the first few minutes.\r\nSometimes a cloud of dust advancing before it demonstrates its force.\r\n\r\nThis moment immediately before the storm breaks is the dramatic moment of\r\nthe entire cyclone. As in a tragedy, the interest has built up to this\r\nsupreme occasion, this knife thrust, from which interest recedes until\r\nclear skies show that the play is over. From 12 to 36 hours is the usual\r\ntime required in winter. In summer the cyclone takes even longer to pass a\r\ngiven point, but the period of rainfall, in which the winter storm's\r\namount is often surpassed, may not last fifteen minutes. First the blow,\r\nthen a crash of thunder, and the rain in big drops, which lessen rapidly\r\nin size as the whole world seems involved in the vast forces of the storm\r\ncenter. Most of the precipitation occurs in the first fifteen minutes,\r\nsometimes in the first five. A hearty storm will deliver an inch in short\r\norder. Although the rain continues often for an hour and sometimes in the\r\nstorms that are attached to a well-defined cyclonic system there will be\r\ntwo or three robust thunderstorms in succession, yet the first downpour is\r\nusually the torrential one and the others die away until the conditions\r\nthat caused the outbreak have passed off. With the severer storms hail\r\nfalls.\r\n\r\nThe general condition of the air after a thunderstorm is cooler, dryer,\r\nand more invigorating than before. Ozone has been liberated, dust has been\r\nwashed from the air and vegetation. The surest sign of a continuation of\r\nunsettled weather is the failure of the atmosphere to cool off. If the air\r\nremains sultry and heavy and depressing another shower is due. In such\r\ncircumstances the wind will not have begun to blow with any great promise\r\nfrom the west.\r\n\r\nA close, sultry morning is the best indication of a thunder-gust. The\r\nlarge piles of cumulus clouds are called thunderheads for the very reason\r\nthat they almost always precede a thunderstorm. The heaviest electrical\r\ndisturbances have cirrus clouds a few hours in advance of them very much\r\nas their winter relatives. A thunderstorm that does not cause the\r\nbarometer to fall considerably will not amount to a great deal.\r\n\r\nAt night the different kinds of lightning furnish a running commentary to\r\nthe storm. On calm evenings the sky will be cloudless, with perhaps the\r\nexception of a low rim on the northern horizon. Yet flashes of lightning,\r\nof course without thunder, may be seen illuminating that entire quadrant\r\nof the sky. This is called heat lightning and is popularly supposed to be\r\nthe result of the heat only. As a matter of fact it is caused by a normal\r\nthunderstorm that is operating below the horizon. Reflections from this\r\nstorm are shown on the rim of clouds, or if no clouds are visible, on the\r\nbowl of the sky. If you see lightning be sure that there is a storm\r\nsomewhere.\r\n\r\nIf this disembodied sort of lightning continues to flash from the western\r\nsky it is quite possible that the storm will reach you. If it shows on the\r\nnorthwest or north of you the chances are that the storm will be carried\r\naround. If the wind is from the southwest and the lightning appears there\r\nonly the progress of the clouds will show whether the storm is pursuing\r\nthe normal track from the west and around you or whether it is edging up\r\ntoward you. One cannot be very well surprised by a thunderstorm of any\r\nenergy in camp as the lightning shows as much as two hours before the\r\nstorm breaks and the thunder gives fifteen minutes' notice on most\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nThe sort of lightning that spends itself illuminating the clouds in\r\nserpents and willowy branches confines itself to the altitudes and is very\r\nbeautiful and harmless. It is accompanied by thunder that sounds hollow,\r\nthat rumbles over the sky, and usually does not end with the crash and\r\nthud of the more vigorous variety. Such lightning and such thunder are\r\nmore often connected with the sort of storm that comes up very swiftly on\r\na western wind. It gives shorter warning than any other sort of\r\nthunderstorm and is not connected with the cyclonic area. I have known\r\nsuch a storm to manifest itself low in the west, approach, and break\r\nwithin twenty minutes. Much wind results and not much rain, although the\r\ntemperature falls. Lightning with storms of this impromptu kind rarely\r\ndoes any damage.\r\n\r\nBut if the storm rises slowly against the wind, requiring an hour or two\r\nor three to approach and break, the lightning will grow almost\r\ncontinuously, some of the flashes being broad streamers cleaving the\r\nwestern sky. It is this sort of lightning that does the damage. The\r\nthunder, instead of rolling like an empty barrel, hits into a series of\r\nconcussions. If the lightning strikes an object nearby the crash is\r\nrather appalling. There are several freak sorts of lightning such as the\r\nball form, which are rare.\r\n\r\nThe approach of the center of disturbance may be gauged by the length of\r\ntime that elapses between flash and crash. In reality the thunder occurs\r\nimmediately after the discharge of electricity, but sound travels so\r\nslowly, compared to light, that a minute may intervene between stroke and\r\nclap. You may count the seconds, noticing the regular decrease, signifying\r\nthe nearing of the crisis. Soon a flash in front and a simultaneous peal\r\nwill show you that you are in the thick of things. The next bolt or two\r\nmay hit very close and you can appreciate what it means to be on the\r\nfiring line. Then the next river of fire with its detonation streams\r\nbehind you and you are saved.\r\n\r\nIn a severe thunderstorm there are several centers, several nuclei that\r\nshed destruction like great batteries and their progress over and beyond\r\nyou has its thrills. You may find the exact number of feet away that the\r\nbolt hit by multiplying the number of seconds elapsing between the\r\nlightning and thunder by 1120. But an easier way is to allow a mile for\r\nevery five seconds on the watch. One or two seconds, and you are pretty\r\nnear the center of the fray.\r\n\r\nLightning compresses the air, leaving a partial vacuum. The other air\r\nrushing in to fill this partial vacuum forms the wave motion that produces\r\nthe noise. That is the whole why of thunder. The reason thunder rolls is\r\nthat the lightning is a series of discharges each of which gives rise to a\r\nparticular detonation. If lightning were but one discharge, the thunder\r\nwould be but one stupefying crash. Reflections from the clouds and from\r\nlayers of air of different densities and from the ground are agencies that\r\nprolong the sound.\r\n\r\nOur atmosphere is never lacking in electricity. This electricity is always\r\npositive in clear weather and sometimes negative in cloudy. Science\r\nconcludes, then, that negative electricity invariably indicates rain,\r\nhail, or snow within a radius of forty miles.\r\n\r\nMoist air is a good conductor. Our powerful motors can now produce a spark\r\nof electricity several feet long. But some of the flashes that shoot\r\nacross the sky in a big storm extend over five miles. The duration of the\r\nflash varies from 1-300th of a second to a second. The reason that\r\nlightning does not always pass imperially along a straight line is that\r\nsome air, either moister or warmer than the air around it, offers less\r\nresistance. The lightning takes this line of least resistance along the\r\npathway of warmer or less dense air.\r\n\r\nAltitudes of thunderclouds vary. They may hover above the earth at 800\r\nfeet. They may be a mile high. They have been observed on peaks of\r\nmountains three miles high. Many other electrical phenomena are observed\r\nin the mountains. The study of these will undoubtedly benefit meteorology\r\nand perhaps go far to explain the unsolved problems of the Service.\r\n\r\nOne kind of thunderstorm that is rather rare is that which arrives in\r\nwinter with the passage of an energetic cyclone. Often when the wind,\r\nhaving been in the southeast for most of the storm, is passing around and\r\nreaches the south or southwest the rainfall culminates in a deluge and\r\nthunder is heard. One or two such storms are a winter's complement. They\r\nusually terminate the rainfall for that particular cyclone. I have never\r\nheard of damage caused by these winter electrical storms, and they occur\r\nonly in exceptionally well-developed areas of low pressure.\r\n\r\nLightning has many times been observed during heavy snow storms. I have\r\nnever heard any thunder with it. The discharge must have been very faint.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STRATUS\r\n\r\n_Courtesy of Richard F. Warren_\r\n\r\nStratus is merely lifted fog in a horizontal form, the lowest of all, and\r\nthe simplest as regards structure. It means neither rain nor snow and the\r\napparent clearness of the blue above it would indicate clear weather to\r\ncome. But through the break in the stratus near the horizon shows a cloud\r\nof firmer texture, which is less reassuring. Stratus over the land in\r\nwinter takes the appearance of long bolsters of gray through which a pale\r\nblue sky shines. Such clouds may blanket the sky for days without causing\r\na drop of rain. If they show a tendency to glaze over expect snow or rain,\r\nbut not in large quantities.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fascination that a thunderstorm has for many people is explained\r\npartially by the fact that one sees the whole process from beginning to\r\nend. The officials of the Weather Bureau have this privilege as regards\r\ncyclones. It is their business and pleasure to watch the setting up of\r\nthese vast storms, to follow them on their journey. It is small wonder\r\nthen that they find the spectacle fascinating.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TORNADO\r\n\r\nThe birds, the flowers, and the tornadoes are all busiest in spring. And\r\nthe tornadoes probably make the largest impression.\r\n\r\nA tornado is merely a whirl of air, caused, as are all the other whirls,\r\nby a striking difference in temperature in adjacent areas. A tornado is a\r\nlocal and restricted example of the same thing that a cyclone is. But a\r\ntornado rarely crosses more than a single state; a cyclone strides\r\ncontinents. A tornado lasts, in one place, about a minute; a cyclone\r\naffects the weather for three days. A tornado never survives the night; a\r\ncyclone plods on for a week. And yet if you are betting on destruction put\r\nyour money on the tornado. What it lacks in the realms of space and time\r\nit makes up in intensity. Its sting is fatal.\r\n\r\nTornadoes occur chiefly in the spring because the temperature changes are\r\ngreatest then and it is from these that the tornado sucks its nourishment.\r\nOver the plains, for example, a limited area is abnormally heated by a\r\nlocal cause. Abnormal cold comes in contact with the abnormal heat. The\r\ngreat difference in pressure results in a spiral as it did in the cyclone,\r\nonly in a very small spiral, and once begun its energy is\r\nself-aggravating. The whole thing moves off toward the northeast attended\r\nby the black cloud of its condensation. From the black cloud a funnel like\r\nan elephant's trunk sways back and forth, now touching the ground and now\r\nescaping it. The black cloud has been in the southwest for some time\r\nprobably before it has commenced to move. The day has been very\r\noppressive. The sun rose rather coppery, in all likelihood. As the black\r\ncloud with the swaying funnel nears a roaring is heard. Darkness falls.\r\nThe roar increases.... Instantly it is over.\r\n\r\nNow that you've been through a tornado you know how it feels,--almost.\r\nAfter the funnel passes hail falls, lightning flashes through the\r\nlessening murk. Heavy rain succeeds, and if you're alive you go out and\r\nrescue the perishing.\r\n\r\nThe wind velocity in the path of a tornado is enormous,--anything up to\r\n500 miles an hour,--but no instruments have been devised to withstand the\r\nstrain. Varying pressures are responsible for the destruction. As the\r\nfunnel passes over a house where the normal air pressure is about 2,000\r\npounds to the square foot it removes 1,500 pounds for an instant.\r\nNaturally the outside walls cannot withstand this enormous inside out\r\npressure and the house explodes like a projectile. Only under such\r\nconditions could the vagaries of matter,--straws piercing logs and\r\nchickens bereft of every feather--be perhaps not explained but pardoned.\r\n\r\nStories of any degree of incredibility crop up after each tornado, often\r\nwith accompanying photographs as proof. People are plastered with mud,\r\npianos are deposited in neighboring lots, babies are hung up unhurt by\r\ntheir clothes in tree-tops, and often one person is killed and another\r\nnearby escapes unhurt, Bible-fashion.\r\n\r\nTornadoes may form almost anywhere, but they are never found on the\r\nimmediate Pacific coast. They are most common in the Mississippi Valley,\r\nare rather common in the Gulf States, and have occurred throughout most of\r\nthe East at one time or another.\r\n\r\nSince there is no way of stopping them the next best thing is to know the\r\nconditions that make for their formation. If the Weather Bureau predicts\r\na cold wave for sections of the country where the weather is already\r\nabnormally warm the line of meeting will probably produce a tornado\r\nsomewhere. The officials, however, advise you not to worry until you see\r\nthe intensely black cloud in the southwest trailing its funnel. See where\r\nthis funnel is tending and run the other way. All tornadoes progress from\r\nthe southwest to the northeast. Bad as they are, this makes them far less\r\nterrifying than if they whipped back and forth over a town or chased you\r\naround the pasture. If you happen to be in the house, take to the cellar,\r\nthe southwest corner of it. If you can't escape lie face down to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe only tornado that I have ever witnessed was an undeveloped one in\r\nEngland, and a bit lethargic compared to those of the Prairie States. But\r\neven this blew an entire train off the track. It had all the other\r\nappurtenances of a tornado, the hail, the twisted trees, the narrow\r\nsouthwest to northeast path. The fact that the houses had only corners of\r\ntheir roofs blown off showed that as a tornado it was distinctly\r\nsecond-grade and without power to explode.\r\n\r\nEngland, shortly after, was raided by three water-spouts. These phenomena\r\nare caused by precisely the same conditions as are the tornadoes. They\r\nform over the sea, and the funnel is composed of water. They take\r\nconsiderable bodies of water up into the skies and torrential rains result\r\nover adjacent districts. If I remember correctly, two of the English\r\nwater-spouts broke against the cliffs and the other, moving inland in\r\nmodified form, gave Gloucester a nine-inch rain. Ships have been known to\r\nfire cannon at these spouts. If one hit a boat directly damage might be\r\ncaused, but they have little of the destructive force of the tornado.\r\n\r\nAs our country builds up the destruction from this most powerful of all\r\nphenomena is likely to increase. Bureau warnings over phones may result in\r\nthe saving of some lives; cellars will undoubtedly be built in the\r\nprincipal zones. But the problem is an interesting one, for unlike the\r\nwaterspout, cannon cannot be employed to shatter an emptiness that stalks\r\nthe more malignantly the emptier it is.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HURRICANE\r\n\r\nThe tropical hurricane is undoubtedly nature's mightiest exhibit. The\r\nhurricane is the cyclone par excellence. It does not differ from our\r\nordinary weekly cyclone in the essentials of wind rotation or pressures\r\nor rainfall; but it does differ in place of birth, in its course, and\r\nchiefly in its intensity.\r\n\r\nThe genuine hurricane is a West Indian production. It is generally cradled\r\nin those islands south and east of Jamaica and Cuba. It is nursed by the\r\ntrade-winds. The first notice of its birth is an alteration in these\r\nwinds, which are among the most regular observances on our planet. An\r\nextensive formation of cirrus clouds spreads over the sky and the\r\nbarometer, which has been stationary for some days, edges off and begins a\r\nlong and gradual fall. Great rollers are noticed for a day or two before\r\nthe winds rise. A hurricane moves slowly.\r\n\r\nThis tropical organization is superior in depth to our shallow, disc-like,\r\ncontinental cyclone which is one and rarely over two miles thick. The\r\nhurricane rears its head three, four, and even five miles high. Instead,\r\ntoo, of dissipating its force over thousands of miles at once it is only a\r\nfew hundred miles in diameter. Its center moves methodically along at the\r\nnot very impressive speed of fifteen miles an hour, while our cyclones\r\nhurry along at thirty. But the hurricane is thorough. The wind about its\r\ncenter reaches a velocity of 120 miles an hour. This velocity has never\r\nyet been attained on the surface of the earth by our trans-continental\r\ncyclone.\r\n\r\nOur cyclone always has an eastward trend; the hurricane has a parabolic\r\ncourse. It begins by moving west on the trades, drifting and dealing\r\ndestruction to the banana and sugar plantations of Jamaica. It enters the\r\nGulf of Mexico, and since it is then pretty much out of the influence of\r\nthe trades it curves to the right and begins to act like any other storm\r\nby heading directly for the St. Lawrence. If it passes out through the\r\nFlorida straits it never reaches the St. Lawrence but speeds up the coast\r\nand out to sea, usually at Hatteras to follow the shipping routes across\r\nthe North Atlantic.\r\n\r\nBut if it has become so involved in the Gulf of Mexico that it cannot\r\nescape to sea again, it comes up through the Gulf States and on toward New\r\nEngland. Fortunately as it goes inland its intensity diminishes because it\r\nhas not so much energy-giving moisture to draw from. Also its sphere of\r\naction widens, its embrace is less mighty, its characteristics more those\r\nof an ordinary continental cyclone. It manages, however, to deliver gales\r\nof 80 miles an hour along the coastal plain, increasing to 100 at the\r\nexposed places such as Hatteras and Block Island.\r\n\r\nThe intensest hours of a hurricane are those when its course is changing\r\nfrom westward to eastward. Enormous rainfalls accompany these storms,\r\namounting to six inches in some instances. Since one inch of rain amounts\r\nto 100 tons per acre, and 64,000 tons to a square mile one can imagine the\r\ngreat amount of evaporation that has taken place to so saturate the air as\r\nto drench vast territories to such an extent.\r\n\r\nWhile scarcely a year goes by without one of these West Indian hurricanes\r\ndistinguishing itself on our shores the one that visited Galveston in 1904\r\neclipsed all. It chose to turn in the vicinity of the city. The gale\r\nincreased to over 100 miles an hour and the wind gauge then blew away. The\r\nwaters of the Bay were heaped up and three thousand lives were lost in the\r\nflood and wreck of flying houses. This peculiar storm did not turn\r\nnortheast at once but ascended the Mississippi, turning at the Lakes and\r\nproceeding down the St. Lawrence after having spent a week in our country.\r\n\r\nThe listless doldrums have sent us 121 of these storms in the last\r\ngeneration. June has seen 8, July 5, August 28, September 40, and October\r\n40.\r\n\r\nSea-yarners have seized upon the hurricane to energize many a flagging\r\nchapter, and particularly have they emphasized the eye of the storm. The\r\neye is that vortex where contending winds neutralize each other into a\r\ncalm, where the sun shines out through the scud, where the waves, relieved\r\nof the great pressure, leap upward in wild disorder. Then the center\r\npasses and the wind flings itself upon the unlucky bark from the opposite\r\nquarter. Its first onslaught is always represented as being the fiercest\r\nof the whole storm and gradually lessening as the center drives farther\r\naway. This is true in the same way that the first attack of the\r\nthunderstorm is usually the fiercest, both being when the pressure begins\r\nto rise. This savage change to the northwest is naturally the hardest of\r\nall for the ships to bear as they must steady at once against the severest\r\nblast instead of gradually bracing for its culmination. In no department\r\nof meteorology has fiction adhered so closely to the facts as in the\r\nsea-rover accounts of the hurricane.\r\n\r\nBut in real life there is very little excuse for the vessel to be caught\r\nanywhere near the disastrous center of the storm. Indeed, for generations\r\nsea-captains have known how to escape the deadly eye. By watching the\r\nbarometer and noticing in which direction the wind is working round they\r\ncan tell the course to a nicety and estimate its speed. Then the wise\r\nones run the other way for even the _Olympics_ and _Imperators_ of the sea\r\nare cowed by the might of the West Indian.\r\n\r\nThe typhoons of the West Pacific are similar manifestations.\r\n\r\nThe hurricane moves off from its birthplace so slowly that our Weather\r\nBureau has an opportunity to size it up, to chart its probable course, and\r\nto warn shipping interests. The ship-owners, as a class, appreciate the\r\nservice of the Bureau and obey its warnings. Vessels with cargoes of a\r\ntotal value of $30,000,000 were known to have been detained in port on the\r\nAtlantic coast by the Bureau's warnings of a single hurricane. Now that a\r\nmuch vaster commerce will steam through these dangerous waters toward the\r\nPanama Canal the warnings will assume an even greater importance.\r\n\r\nThe best description of a hurricane that it has been my fortune to read is\r\nin a story entitled \"Chita,\" one of the remarkable fictions of Lafcadio\r\nHearn. As truthfully as a scientist and with great beauty of style he has\r\npictured the long days of burning sun, the foreboding calm, the thickening\r\nhaze, the ominous increasing swell of the ocean, a breathless night with\r\nthe lightning glowing from between piling towers of cloud, the startling\r\nsuddenness of the wind's attack, its fury, the hissing rain, the shrill\r\ncrescendo of the gale.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOUDBURST\r\n\r\nIt is the American tendency to exaggerate. We call every snowstorm a\r\nblizzard, every breeze a gale, every shower a cloudburst. In our generous\r\nvocabulary it never rains but it pours. Consequently if we, in the East,\r\never had a real blizzard or a real cloudburst we should be at a\r\nconsiderable loss to find words for an unprofane description. I do not\r\nknow how they manage out West where these things occur.\r\n\r\nA genuine cloudburst must be an amazing spectacle. It is caused by a\r\nfurious updraft of wind keeping a rainstorm in suspense until so much\r\nwater has accumulated that it has to let go all at once and the\r\naccumulation descends like a wet blanket.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon is staged in the mountains; most often in the Rockies\r\nwhere melting snow and desert-hot ravines provide the necessary extremes\r\nof temperature. Wind blowing up a mountain-side can maintain considerable\r\nforce,--so much that a man cannot possibly walk against it. Black thunder\r\nclouds brew on the peaks. Suddenly the collapse, and the person who tells\r\nthe story afterward finds himself struggling in a torrent that a minute\r\nbefore had been a dry gulch. The moral of the story seems to be that if\r\nyou are camping in the mountains and there is a strong upstream wind\r\nblowing and the clouds darken about the hill-tops and the thunder mumbles\r\nthen don't make your bed in the creek-bottom lands. The high water marks\r\nof former freshets, but not of cloudbursts, show on the side of the\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nEven in the less impulsive East a couple of inches of rain make a\r\nsurprising rise in a little creek.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HALO\r\n\r\nThe halo is a luminous circle around the moon or the sun. It is caused by\r\nthe refraction of light passing through moisture, which at the usual\r\nheight is in the form of ice-crystals. The halo when complete consists of\r\ntwo large circles whose diameters are constant, 45 and 92 degrees. Then\r\nthere are often other arches in contact. At each point of contact occurs a\r\nparhelion which is a mock sun of brilliant colors and called a sun-dog.\r\nSince the sun-dog is brighter than the other parts of the halo it\r\nsometimes appears when the rest of the halo cannot be seen. Sun-dogs hunt\r\nin pairs or fours. If the halo is colored the red is on the inside. When\r\nthe colors are caused by diffraction instead of refraction, the red is on\r\nthe outside of the prismatic ring and the halo is called a corona.\r\n\r\nHaving now satisfied the demands of science all that can be forgotten\r\nexcept that the halo around either sun or moon means excess moisture in\r\nthe atmosphere. The wide halos are seen in the high cirrus clouds 25, 36,\r\n48 hours in advance of a cyclone. At first the ring is very wide and faint\r\nwith several stars in it. If the storm is advancing rapidly the halo\r\nbrightens and narrows and the stars fade. This is proof to show that the\r\nproverb stating that the number of stars inside the ring is a forecast of\r\nthe number of days of storm is sheer nonsense. For presently the ring\r\ncloses and the stars disappear which would show according to the proverb\r\nthat the storm had changed its mind and would cut down the number of days\r\nfrom several to none.\r\n\r\nThe moon grows paler. The light that it casts upon the earth is eerie at\r\nthis stage. Within a few hours the cocoon of mist is completely woven\r\nabout the moon. The circle has closed. Snow or rain begins within a few\r\nhours after the moon has entirely disappeared. If it does not so begin it\r\nshows that the process of increasing humidity is a very slow one and the\r\nstorm center is probably passing far to one side of the observer. Also if\r\nthe snow begins before the light of the moon is entirely suppressed the\r\ndisturbance is a shallow one and the storm will be light.\r\n\r\nWhen the halo is actually a corona (red outside) the approach of the storm\r\ncan be gauged by the rapidity with which the circle grows smaller. For a\r\ndecrease in diameter denotes that the size of the moisture drops is\r\nincreasing and therefore the storm is approaching. As a matter of fact the\r\ncorona will have disappeared long before the time for rain. Still it is\r\nuseful to know that if the corona increases in size the conditions are\r\nclearing. With the halo the reverse holds. For when the clouds are very\r\nhigh the halo looks small, and high clouds imply swifter winds and a\r\ngreater distance from the storm center.\r\n\r\nThe Zuñi Indians who have an eye for the picturesque as well as for the\r\ntruth state the chief fact about haloes happily: \"When the sun is in his\r\nhouse it will rain soon.\" Another saying of theirs anent cumulus clouds\r\nholds for our country as well as for theirs: \"When the clouds rise in\r\nterraces of white, soon will the country of the corn-priests be pierced\r\nwith the arrows of rain.\"\r\n\r\nThere are many little observations which the man who has kept the corner\r\nof his eye open may profit by and yet which are rather difficult to\r\nexpress in type. Who could describe an egg for instance whose springtide\r\nof youth was far behind and yet was not quite ready for the discard! In\r\nnature it is the fleeting moment of transition, the half-tones of the\r\nborder that are so hard to catch, so difficult to portray, and yet so very\r\nimportant not to miss if one is to become sure. There follow some of the\r\nbaldest and most communicable half-facts about the weather that should be\r\nused oftener to bolster up some opinion gleaned from more positive sources\r\nthan to mould one in their own strength.\r\n\r\nMoisture in the atmosphere helps sight to a certain extent. For when the\r\nair is full of moisture its temperature tends to become equalized,\r\nobliterating irregularities which would otherwise reflect the vibrations\r\nproducing sight and sound. So if one hears better or sees better on a\r\ncertain day it augurs a moister atmosphere,--an auxiliary sign if there is\r\na view that you are fond of looking at many times a day. In the city,\r\nalas, clearer vision on one day than another means merely that less coal\r\nis being used. But in camp there is very often a perceptible difference\r\nin one's seeing ability even on days that could all be classed as clear.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that the haunter of the woods may notice is that his\r\nsmelling capacity is increased before a storm. The increase of humidity\r\nwhich precedes a rain buoys up odors and depresses smoke. Even in dry\r\nweather if you will stroll by a marsh you will notice how rank the\r\nvegetation smells and how the smells float in layers in the air strata of\r\ndifferent humidity. One's sense of smell is a very slender thread on which\r\nto hang a storm, however.\r\n\r\nFires burn more briskly in dry air than in moist, but to tell the\r\ndifference (if you can't feel it) you must be very sure that your wood is\r\nas dry on one day as on another.\r\n\r\nBefore a rain many plants close their flowers or shift their leaves. The\r\ndandelion, pimpernel, red clover, silver maple are good examples of this,\r\nbut they would not be of much use in the North Woods. The closing, too,\r\ntakes place only a few hours before rain and is merely confirmation of the\r\nsignals rendered more adequately by clouds and winds.\r\n\r\nBugs and flies are particularly annoying before a storm and it is\r\nsurprising that the spider should not take advantage of this to get a\r\nmeal. But spiders are cautious and they never spin a web on the grass, at\r\nleast on the day that brings a storm. The insects do not fly so high on\r\nthese weather-breeding days and consequently the birds that feed on them\r\nfly lower. The chimney swifts are a particularly good guide to the\r\ndifferent altitudes at which insects fly.\r\n\r\nThe stars are on a par with bugs as weather guides, although there are\r\nmany proverbs that grant them much. One circumstance should not be\r\nneglected, however, and that is that wind mixes air and when air is well\r\nmixed atmospheric inequalities are less disturbing to vision. Hence when\r\none can see the stars and the moon well wind currents are oftenest the\r\ncause. Even if it is not blowing on earth these wind currents may yet be\r\nblowing above to reach the earth later. In this way cold waves arrive.\r\nThere is an old proverb about this condition, applying it to the moon,\r\n\"Sharp horns do threaten windy weather.\"\r\n\r\nBut the stars are of second rate importance because they are so soon\r\nobscured. If you can't see them it is cloudy, but you do not know what\r\nkind of cloud it is. If only the brightest show, a veil of cirrus is\r\narriving. A dark sky with only a few dim stars is an omen of storms. If\r\nthe stars twinkle it is because the varying currents of the upper air are\r\nin juxtaposition. If they twinkle while the northwest wind is on it is a\r\nsign of colder weather,--not because they are twinkling but because of the\r\nnorthwest wind.\r\n\r\nIn the days when almanacs were the sole guides to the weather a man with a\r\nsense of humor, Butler by name, got out one and dedicated it to \"Torpid\r\nLiver and Inflammatory Rheumatism, the Most Insistent Weather Prophets\r\nKnown to Suffering Mortals.\" Rheumatism is following the almanac to the\r\nscrap heap, and it would be harder for a camper to guess what a torpid\r\nliver was like than to forecast the weather, yet for the majority of\r\n\"suffering mortals\" there is still much truth in the amiable observation\r\nof Mr. Butler,\r\n\r\n    \"As old sinners have old points\r\n    O' the compass in their bones and joints.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE BAROMETER\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever the foregoing chapters may imply as to the whole world going\r\ncamping the fact is that the woods are still, unfortunately, for the few.\r\nThe woodsman must yield gracefully to the suburbanite,--in numbers.\r\n\r\nBut the weather is for everybody. To be sure the sunrise that talks so\r\nconfidentially to the hunter of the coming day does not exist for the\r\ncommuter. But the coming day does, even though the things it means are\r\nessentially different. To the hunter with his seasoned clothes and\r\nwell-earned health a rain is only of concern in so much as it affects the\r\nbusiness of the day; personally it is of small moment. But to the commuter\r\nwhat does the weather mean? Dollars and cents, of course. His business\r\ngoes on, but to his person one unexpected shower = the cost of pressing a\r\nsuit; one thorough soaking = one doctor's bill. For you cannot expect\r\nthe man to throw off a chill who can quiet his conscience on the matter of\r\ndaily exercise by watering the geraniums and reading the newspaper.\r\n\r\nWeather wisdom is necessary for the hunter; for the commuter it pays.\r\n\r\nThe hunter had to rely on local weather signs. The commuter can go him one\r\nbetter by investing $10 (how finance will creep in!) in a little aneroid\r\nbarometer. The local weather signs were good for twelve hours at the\r\nlongest. The barometer is a faithful instrument that adds another twelve\r\nhours to a man's knowledge. Half a day, or even a day before any local\r\nsign of changing wind or growing cloud appears the barometer is on the\r\njob. It will register in Philadelphia the news of a disturbance\r\napproaching the Mississippi. So sensitive is it that it is the slave to\r\nevery wave of the great air ocean.\r\n\r\nThe barometer gauges for the eye the amount of atmosphere that is piled\r\nabove one. If the amount is normal and at sea-level the instrument will\r\nmeasure 30.00 inches. This air pressure is equivalent to a column of water\r\n30 feet high. As this would make unwieldy prognosticators the scientists\r\nuse mercury instead, which requires a column less than three feet long.\r\nAnd for general purposes this is supplanted by the handy little aneroid\r\n(which means \"without fluid\"). This is so fixed that the pressure of the\r\nair influences the upper surface of a vacuum chamber, balanced perfectly\r\nbetween this pressure and a main spring. This action is transmitted to an\r\nindex hand moving across the dial marked into fractions of inches after\r\nthe manner of the recognized standard, the mercurial barometer.\r\n\r\nWhen the warm moist light air of a cyclone invades a locality the pressure\r\nis partially removed, the vacuum chamber is not pressed so hard and the\r\ndial hand or the mercury subsides. When the cold, dry, heavy air of the\r\nanticyclone lumbers in more pressure is applied and the mercury, or the\r\ndial hand, climbs. So a falling barometer means a storm, a rising one fair\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nThat is a generality that glitters. If that were all there was to it\r\nweather officials would have a sinecure. But each cyclone varies in size,\r\nintensity, and rate of progress. Some do not advance for days. Therefore\r\nthere has grown up a pretty large body of information as each storm has\r\nhad to be watched and the barometric movements recorded. The most\r\nimportant variations follow:\r\n\r\nRemembering that 30.00 inches is sea-level normal, if the barometer is\r\nsteady at 30.10 or 30.20 the weather will remain fair as long as the\r\nsteadiness continues, and on the turn, if the fall proceeds slowly with\r\nthe wind from a westerly direction fair to partly cloudy weather with\r\nslowly rising temperature will follow for two days.\r\n\r\nIf the barometer rises rapidly from 30.10 the fall will be equally rapid\r\nand rain or snow may be expected within a couple of days. Since the\r\ndepressions of the atmosphere tend to a certain regularity about the\r\ncenter of the storm it follows that the reactions will follow the actions\r\nin similar manner,--a long rise portending a long fall and a variable\r\nglass meaning unsettled conditions.\r\n\r\nThe barometer does not rise with wind from an easterly direction unless a\r\nshift is imminent. In winter the air is so much colder over the land than\r\nover the sea that the air brought in by an easterly wind is soon\r\ncondensed. Consequently with winds from the south or southeast, even if\r\nthe barometer is 30.20 or 30.10 and falling slowly rain usually arrives\r\n(and rain of course is meant to include snow whenever the mercury is below\r\nthe freezing point) within 24 hours. If the fall is rapid there may be\r\nprecipitation within 12 hours, and the wind will rapidly increase and the\r\ntemperature rise.\r\n\r\nIf the wind is from the east or northeast and the barometer 30.10 or above\r\nand falling slowly it means rain within 24 hours in winter. In summer if\r\nthe wind is light rain may not fall for a day or so. If the fall is rapid\r\nin winter rain with increasing winds will often set in when the barometer\r\nbegins its fall and the wind gets to a point a little east of north.\r\n\r\nIf the barometer is 30.00 or below and falling slowly with northeast to\r\nsoutheast winds the storm will continue 24 to 48 hours. If the barometer\r\nfalls rapidly the wind will be high with rain and the change to rising\r\nbarometer with clearing and colder will probably come within 20 to 30\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nIf the barometer is below 30.00 but rising slowly the clear weather will\r\nlast several days.\r\n\r\nIf the barometer is 29.80 or below and falling rapidly with winds south of\r\neast a severe storm is at hand to be followed within 24 hours by clearing\r\nand colder. Under the same conditions but with northeast winds there will\r\noccur heavy snow followed by a cold wave.\r\n\r\nIf these promises do not always bear fruit it is because they will have\r\nbeen interrupted by an unseen shifting of the atmospheric weights. But\r\nthe barometer will record them. A rapid rise may be checked in ascent and\r\nthe instrument may fluctuate like a stock-ticker. Its tale is of very\r\nunsettled weather conditions and consequently no particular brand of\r\nweather will last for very long at a time.\r\n\r\nA sudden rise of the barometer may bring its gale of wind as well as a\r\nsudden fall. But the tendency will be toward clearing and much colder.\r\n\r\nA fall of the barometer on a west wind is not common. It means rain. A\r\nrise on a south wind means fair. A low barometer and a cold south wind\r\nmean a change to west with squalls for a while. On the other hand, a high\r\nbarometer with warmer weather means a shift of the wind to southerly\r\nquarters and an imminent fall.\r\n\r\nIf the barometer rises fast and the temperature does, too, look for\r\nanother storm. This is often noticed in summer.\r\n\r\nThere is a slight daily oscillation of the mercury, which, if other things\r\nare steady, registers highest at 10 A. M. and 10 P. M. and lowest at 4 A.\r\nM. and 4 P. M.\r\n\r\nIf this data confuses bear in mind the simple ordinary progress of the\r\nbarometer in the usual storm: First, it will stand steady for a day or so\r\nat any point between 30.10 and 30.50. Then the glass will begin (for most\r\nstorms) to fall gradually. As the center nears the fall hastens. After the\r\nlowest point has been reached a slight rise will be followed by another\r\nslight fall and then the final long rise will commence. The rain begins\r\nand ceases at different stages for different storms, depending upon the\r\nwind's velocity and direction.\r\n\r\nFor every 900 feet of altitude the height of the mercury is about one inch\r\nless. Do not complain that your barometer is inaccurate if you are living\r\nup in the mountains and your readings are not the same as the weather\r\nreports which are reduced to sea level. All the figures given in this\r\nchapter are for sea level and if your house is 1900 feet above you must\r\nmove the copper hand of your aneroid 1.95 inches from the pressure hand.\r\nIf the pressure hand would read 28.05 the adjustable copper hand would\r\nread 30.00 which is the sea level reading.\r\n\r\nOne good thing to remember is that a barometer falls lower for high winds\r\nthan for heavy rain. A fall of two- or three-tenths of an inch in four\r\nhours brings a gale. In the ordinary gale the wind blows hardest when the\r\nbarometer begins its rise from a very low point.\r\n\r\nIn summer a suddenly falling barometer foretells a thunderstorm, and if\r\nthe corresponding rise does not at once take place the unsettled\r\nconditions will continue with probably another thunderstorm. If you see\r\nthe thunderstorm first, that is, if the barometer is not affected by the\r\napproaching black cloud you may be sure that the storm will amount to\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nThe man in the fields or along the shore has many natural barometers in\r\nanimal life. But these natural barometers only corroborate; they do not\r\nforetell, at least very long before. Some are useful at times and among\r\nthese the birds are foremost. The observant Zuñis have incorporated this\r\nin one of their pretty proverbs, \"When chimney swallows circle and call\r\nthey speak of rain.\" As a matter of fact the swallows are circling most of\r\nthe time after insects. If they are flying high it is because the bugs are\r\nflying high and that is because there is no danger of rain. As the rain\r\nnears the air gets moister, the bugs and the birds fly lower.\r\n\r\nWhether they do this because their instinct is to avoid a wetting or\r\nbecause the lighter atmosphere of a cyclone makes flying more difficult,\r\nparticularly at altitudes, I do not know. For weather purposes it is\r\nenough to watch their comparative levels. Wild geese are excellent signs,\r\nI am told, but it would be a dry country that waits for a sight of them\r\nfor its rain.\r\n\r\nBees localize before a storm and will not swarm. Flies crowd upon the\r\nscreens of houses when humidity is high, possibly because the appetizing\r\nodors from within are buoyed afar by the heavy air. Cuckoos seek the\r\nhigher ground in fair weather and disappear into bottom lands before a\r\nrain. Although they are called rain-crows they are heard in all weathers.\r\n\r\nSmoke is as good an evidence of barometric pressure as anything except the\r\ninstrument itself. On clear, still days it will mount; on humid days\r\nwithout wind it will cling to the hill. There is that difference. But it\r\ntakes skill and many comparisons to gauge its angles in the wind. It\r\nbecomes a test in observation and finally rewards one by becoming an\r\nexcellent sign not only of air texture but of the direction of its\r\ncurrents.\r\n\r\nNo reference to barometers would be complete without mentioning spiders.\r\nThey show a most delicate apprehension of changing conditions. If the day\r\nis to be fine and without wind they will run out long threads and be\r\nrather active. If the rain is nearing they strengthen their webs, shorten\r\nthe filaments and sit dully in the center. Fresh webs on the lawn insure\r\na clear day. But for the commuter, whose time is money, there is little\r\nleisure to consider the spider.\r\n\r\nAs a natural result of the variation in altitude affecting the barometer\r\nthe words which are printed on the face become entirely useless. In some\r\nplaces it would be impossible for the needle to point higher than \"Very\r\nStormy.\" Even at sea level a sudden fall to \"Fair\" would cause a rain,\r\nmuch to the indignation of the person who thought that he had purchased a\r\nself-registering weather prophet. Disregard the words but watch the needle\r\nand you will never be surprised at what the weather is doing next.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE SEASONS\r\n\r\n\r\nToo great emphasis cannot be laid upon the futility, at present, of trying\r\nto forecast the weather for more than a very few days in advance. Long\r\nrange efforts are not made by the Bureau because with its present limited\r\nknowledge of the factors that control seasons and with the present limited\r\nfacilities for collecting data the process of looking into next month has\r\nnot been perfected, and the attempt to investigate next winter's weather\r\nproves scientifically impossible.\r\n\r\nAs usual, fakers step in where science fears to tread. With goose-bones\r\n(not their own) and hickory nuts they prophesy with all their might. And\r\nif their prophecies come true, as sometimes they must, there is wide\r\nrejoicing in the newspapers and the cause of science is set back by just\r\nso much. But science cannot be thwarted in the end and every year new\r\ndiscoveries are made, new speculations proved true or forever false, and\r\nsome time, doubtless, the weather will be predicted from year to year\r\nwith the same 85% accuracy with which the 36 hour forecast is now made.\r\nExperimenting is worth the little that it costs, too, for to know when the\r\nsummer is to be dry or wet, hot or cold will be a boon to everybody and to\r\nthe farmer most of all.\r\n\r\nOne conclusion has already been reached by officials in the Weather Bureau\r\nand scientists generally. It has been decided by long search through\r\ncreditable records, painstaking comparisons of averages coupled with the\r\nmost accurate investigations for half a century, that, on the basis of ten\r\nyears, our seasons do not change. That is, counting the decade as a unit,\r\nour weather keeps to the same level of efficiency through the centuries.\r\n\r\nThis statement comes always as a blow. It always provokes argument and\r\ncitations of grandmother's blizzards. There is a great and universal\r\nhesitation in believing that our weather is as good to-day as it used to\r\nbe. The good old times when there was a general debauch of snow and you\r\ncould skate all winter on anything but the Atlantic Ocean certainly appear\r\nno more. As a matter of fact there has been a change, but it has been in\r\nour memories. In grandmother's youth the trains,--if they had trains\r\nthen,--doubtless were stalled by a big snow for then they did not have\r\nrotary plows. In father's day they may have had an unbroken winter of\r\nsleighing. We couldn't now; sleighs are extinct. But in our time, in fact\r\nevery year, some record is being broken and the records go back a\r\nrespectable length of time.\r\n\r\nFor example in Philadelphia the most accurate records made by standard\r\ninstruments have been kept for 43 years. During this time the highest wind\r\nvelocity was recorded in 1878 (75 miles an hour). The greatest rainfall in\r\n24 hours occurred in 1898 (5.89 inches). The lowest temperature was\r\nregistered in 1899 (6 degrees below zero); the highest in 1901 (103\r\ndegrees). The greatest number of thunderstorms for any one year took place\r\nin 1905 when we had 51. As late as 1909 the heaviest snowfall ever\r\nrecorded at this station, amounting to 21 inches, occurred. And just a few\r\nweeks ago (April 3rd, 1915) it snowed 19 inches in half as many hours. All\r\nthese items do not indicate a climate decreasing in virility very swiftly.\r\n\r\nBut there is more evidence yet that Philadelphia is experiencing the same\r\nvarieties of weather in about the same proportions. Diaries of observant\r\nmen running back to 1700 show that almost any kind of memory could be\r\nfounded on fact, that the same violent changes in temperature, the same\r\ndeep snows and unseasonable seasons that we endure to-day were noticed\r\nthen. To quote:\r\n\r\n\"The whole winter of 1780 was intensely cold. The Delaware was closed from\r\nthe 1st of December to the 14th of March. The ice was from two to three\r\nfeet thick.\" We despaired of ever living up to this until three years ago\r\nwhen the same thing happened and sleighs crossed the river a little above\r\nthe city. And despite the new ice-boats!\r\n\r\n\"The winter of 1779 was very mild, particularly the month of February when\r\ntrees were in blossom.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the 31st of December, 1764, the Delaware was frozen completely over in\r\none night, and the weather continued cold until the 28th of March with\r\nsnow about two and a half feet deep.\"\r\n\r\n\"The winter of 1756 was very mild. The first snow was as late as the 18th\r\nof March.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it goes. 1750 was mild; 1742 \"one of the coldest since the\r\nsettlement of the country\"; 1741 was intensely cold, 1725 mild, 1714 very\r\nmild after the 15th of January, 1697 long, stormy and severely cold. The\r\nupshot of it all is that February violets and April snows were just as\r\nwell known to General Washington as they are to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NIMBUS\r\n\r\n_Courtesy of Richard F. Warren_\r\n\r\nNimbus is any cloud from which rain is falling, and the important thing to\r\nknow is how to judge from the formless thing how much longer it is to\r\nrain. The wind is the surest guide. In this picture the nimbus cloud is\r\nonly that at the end of the cape. All the rest is torn stratus and\r\ncumulus, which needs to condense a little further before it becomes\r\nnimbus. This will likely happen because the cloud at the left is very\r\ndark. The broken appearance denotes some wind. Rain does not fall from a\r\nmottled sky nor yet a streaky one; the nimbus is uniform in appearance. In\r\nsummer a break in the nimbus will show a veil of cirro-stratus above. Just\r\nnimbus by itself will not support much of a storm. In winter if the nimbus\r\nis particularly seamless snow is about to fall.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut though all facts point to the fact that the climate does not change in\r\na decade or a generation or a dozen generations, there is some comfort for\r\nthose who are not satisfied in knowing that it doesn't stay the same\r\nforever. During the carboniferous times the poles were as warm as the\r\ntropics and when the Ice Age came on it was very chilly everywhere. If one\r\nmight only live an eon or two he might then well complain of the changing\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nClimate, however, is one thing, weather another. The climate is the sum\r\ntotal of the weather. Climate is as enduring as our Constitution, the\r\nweather is as changeable as our city governments. No matter how proud a\r\nscientist may be of the lasting qualities of the climate, he has to admit\r\nthat our weather, taken day by day or even year by year, is versatile in\r\nthe extreme. And the question he has set himself to solve is how to\r\nexplain the variations of the seasonable weather. He wants to find out why\r\nall winters are not alike, and why no two successive springs are the same.\r\nThen he will be on firm ground at last and able to make scientific\r\nforecasts for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nThe obvious thing was to find out as accurately as possible what had\r\nhappened and science's keenest eye was focused on records in the hope of\r\ndiscovering fixed periods of warmth or wetness, cycles of cold and\r\ndrought. So far no cycles have been discovered that are beyond dispute.\r\nNothing has been found that cannot be contradicted successfully. This is\r\ndiscouraging.\r\n\r\nOne of the most frequent starting places for investigators is the spots on\r\nthe sun. They found that periods of three, eight, eleven, and thirty-five\r\nyears should bear some resemblance; 1901 was eagerly looked forward to.\r\nThey wanted it to correspond with the remarkably cool summer of 1867. When\r\nit started off in July with a temperature of 103 degrees, the highest ever\r\nrecorded in Philadelphia, they concluded that the sunspots were fooling\r\nthem. A connection between sunspots and weather has not been established,\r\ntherefore, although they are now known to affect the electrical condition\r\nof the earth's atmosphere. Longer periods of observation will permit\r\ncomparisons that may yet define concurrent cycles of sunspots and weather.\r\n\r\nA definite weather cycle has not yet been discovered, but one step in the\r\nway has been cleared up. We now are pretty sure of one cause for unusual\r\nsingle seasons of heat and cold.\r\n\r\nThere exist in winter great bodies of cold, dry air heaped up over Canada\r\nand Siberia, which are formed by the greater rapidity of radiation over\r\nland surfaces than over water. These mounds of cold air build up during\r\nDecember, January, and February and form great so-called permanent areas\r\nof high barometer. It is on the skirts of the Canadian high that the\r\nsmaller highs form which sweep over our country, giving us our cold waves.\r\nAlso in winter permanent lows form over the North Pacific and North\r\nAtlantic where warm currents afford continuous supplies of warm moist air.\r\nFrom the great Aleutian (Pacific) low spring most of the cyclones which\r\nswing down below the border of the Canadian high, make their turn\r\nsomewhere in the Mississippi Valley, and then head for the Icelandic low.\r\n\r\nIt can be seen that if the Canadian high is a little stronger than usual\r\nand spreads a little farther south, then the northern half of our country\r\nwill come more directly under its influence and we will experience an\r\nunusually severe winter. As the storms are pushed south and as the cold\r\nair pours into the northern quadrants the snow line is pushed south too.\r\nHence all abnormally snowy winters are caused by a strengthening of the\r\npermanent Canadian high which may be central anywhere north of our Dakota\r\nor Montana borders.\r\n\r\nConversely, if this high is weaker than usual the cyclones can cross the\r\ncountry on a line farther north, there will be less snow, and the cold\r\nwaves that follow will be less severe or even non-existent.\r\n\r\nIn summer the reverse occurs. Great oceanic highs are built up over the\r\nSouth Atlantic and South Pacific and a permanent low occupies the center\r\nof our continent. The character of the season is determined by the\r\nstrength and position of these areas. The eastern states are affected\r\nespecially by the slow movements of the South Atlantic low. The puzzle is\r\nwhy should these areas change their power and position, and if they must\r\nchange why don't they do it regularly? The puzzle will undoubtedly be\r\nsolved. These great centers of action will be plotted against and observed\r\nfrom every vantage point by a thousand observers. A fascinating field for\r\nscientific speculation opens.\r\n\r\nAt present our Government exchanges daily observations with stations in\r\nSiberia, Canada, and the West Indies. The great storm-breeder, the\r\nAleutian Low, is watched from Alaskan shores. In the Atlantic the Bureau\r\nneeds stationary ships to record the growth and decline of the High over\r\nthe Azores. Knowledge of the wind circulation from this would inform us\r\nwhether our storms were to be shunted farther north and pushed somewhat\r\ninland. A storm which is pushed to the left of its normal track increases\r\ntremendously in intensity. Whereas a cyclone that limps slackly to the\r\nright of its normal line loses intensity at once. It misses coil. In this\r\nrespect storms seem to resemble rattlesnakes.\r\n\r\nThe energy of the Azores High influences the number and destructiveness of\r\nthe West Indian hurricanes: the larger the area is the closer do the\r\nhurricanes hug our shores and the more destruction do they accomplish.\r\n\r\nThe very sureness that the general average of the seasons is to be the\r\nsame enables us to guess pretty accurately for individual purposes as to\r\nthe kind of season coming next. A guess, let me add, is not a forecast. It\r\nis a gamble and disapproved of by the Bureau, but until they supply us\r\nwith a basis for judgment we will have to go on guessing, for human\r\ncuriosity is as near to perpetual motion as the weather is to the lacking\r\nfourth dimension.\r\n\r\nOne of these guesses is that if the winter has been a warm one the summer\r\nwill be cool, for the very good reason that the yearly average does depart\r\nso slightly from the fixture. Unfortunately one hot summer does not mean\r\nthat the following summer will be cool. Certain sequences of the seasons\r\nhave been observed often enough to have been gathered into proverbs.\r\nEverybody agrees that \"A late spring never deceives.\" \"A year of snow,\r\nFruit will grow.\" \"A green winter makes a full churchyard.\"\r\n\r\nOf the many hundreds of proverbs relating to the seasons a few are sage,\r\nsome outworn, and many sheer nonsense. Nearly all refer to the obvious\r\nfact that one kind of season is followed by another rather unlike it, not\r\nmuch telling what. And there, unsatisfactorily enough, they leave one. But\r\nmuch is to be hoped for from the scientific explorations now in progress.\r\nAnd until they are heard from few of us will realize how many seasonable\r\nseasons we really enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE WEATHER BUREAU\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the cost of a cent and a half a year apiece we Americans are supplied\r\nwith detailed information in advance about the weather. And the\r\ninformation is correct for more than four-fifths of the time. If stock\r\nbrokers never missed oftener, what reputations would accrue!\r\n\r\nCheapness, accuracy, and a certain modesty are the three qualities that\r\ndistinguish the out-givings of the Bureau from the old-fashioned\r\npredictions of the weather which used to appear in almanacs. Almanacs have\r\nprobably kept appearing ever since the art of printing first allowed\r\nunscrupulous persons to juggle with words. They cost fifty cents and their\r\npredictions were based on nothing but the strength of their author's\r\nimagination. Of course, it was impossible for him to guess wrong more than\r\nhalf the time so that when he announced in January that July would be hot\r\nwith thunderstorms he was often right. This gave him prestige, but aided\r\nhis clients little.\r\n\r\nThe Weather Bureau was in about the same position in regard to the quack\r\npredictions of the almanacs as was the honest doctor of the last decade\r\nwho could only prescribe good food and fresh air and moderate exercise for\r\nthe patient who much preferred the expensive allurements of the medicinal\r\ncure-all as advertised. In humility the Bureau said that as things stood\r\nit could not forecast with accuracy for more than 48 hours, and its\r\nhonesty brought it into disregard.\r\n\r\nBut, although the Weather Bureau,--like the Christian Church and other\r\nthings that have had to combat superstition at every step--has grown\r\nslowly it has grown surely and its work is being recognized more widely\r\nand relied upon more understandingly every month. It was an American\r\nscientist who discovered the rotary motion of cyclones and their\r\nprogressive character, but due to the conservative nature of our\r\nGovernment three other nations had established weather services before we\r\nhad. In 1870 the War Department was authorized to start a system of\r\nobservations that would permit of a rough sort of forecasting. The\r\nforecasts proved of so much value to shippers and sailors that the work\r\nwas handed over to the Department of Agriculture and enlarged (1891).\r\nTo-day every part of our country contributes to the knowledge of existing\r\nweather conditions.\r\n\r\nAt 8 A. M. observations are made at hundreds of stations and wired to the\r\nCentral Office at Washington. The Chief there, knowing these conditions,\r\nis enabled to locate a storm, to gauge its rate of speed, to learn its\r\ncourse, and to measure its intensity. He can dictate storm warnings and be\r\nsure that within an hour every sailing master will have a copy. He can\r\ndetect a cold wave at its entrance into our territory and know that within\r\nan hour every shipper, every truckster (who has signified that he wishes\r\nto be informed) will have the facts that will save him money.\r\n\r\nAt 8 P. M. the same stations telegraph the changed conditions, and if any\r\nvery violent disturbance is in progress an observation is made at noon.\r\nBesides the Washington distributing station there are 1700 others from\r\nwhich warnings are sent by telegraph, telephone, or mail. There are\r\n100,000 addresses on the mailing list and 5,000,000 telephone subscribers\r\ncan get them within an hour. The newspapers reach many millions. And all\r\nthis at a cost of 1-1/2 cents a year. If we, in a fit of generosity,\r\nshould pay 2 cents, or even 2-1/2 the Government would be enabled to work\r\nout many of the larger problems awaiting only a larger appropriation to be\r\nattacked.\r\n\r\nThe people's investment of $1,600,000 a year is a good investment. In one\r\nyear the Service saves a great many hundred per cent. A few known savings\r\nare worth giving; $3,500,000 worth of protection was made possible from\r\none exceptionally severe cold wave; the California citrus growers\r\nestimated that one warning saved $14,000,000 worth of fruit; $30,000,000\r\nof shipping (and cargoes) was known to have been detained in port just on\r\naccount of one hurricane warning, and there are many warnings of gales\r\nevery year. Uncalculated savings have been effected among the growers of\r\ntobacco, sugar, cranberries, truck. The railway and transportation\r\ncompanies save, through use of the forecasts, in shipments of bananas,\r\noysters, fish, and eggs. Farmers, manufacturers, raisin driers,\r\nphotographers, insurance companies, and about a hundred and fifty other\r\noccupations increase their profits by a systematic study of the forecasts.\r\n\r\nThe people who live along the rivers often owe their lives and frequently\r\nmuch of their property to telephone warnings of approaching floods. The\r\nflood stages in all the principal rivers and streams have been calculated\r\nand losses are reduced by 75 per cent. by accurate predictions as to when\r\nthe crest of the flood may be expected and how high it will reach. A\r\nhundred uses of river forecasts, even when flood stages are not expected\r\nare given in the booklet, \"The Weather Bureau\" which you can have from\r\nWashington for the asking, like many another of their publications.\r\n\r\nYet, with all the good it does, the man on the street still regards the\r\nBureau as an uninteresting, undependable exhibit in the upper corner of\r\nthe newspaper,--if he regards it at all. It is his child, however, who is\r\ninstructing him. For his child is being taught in the public school all\r\nabout it and he takes his teaching home and becomes the teacher. The child\r\nis father of the (old) man in lots of instances.\r\n\r\nThe most impressive thing about the whole output of the Bureau to the\r\nchild is its Map. The Bureau issues a map every day which is posted in\r\npost-offices and railroad stations and in schools, too, if they ask for\r\nit. And every day this map shows in all its gripping details the way our\r\nstorms are sidling across the continent or rushing up our coasts. It\r\nprints the word low where the stormy area of low barometer is. About the\r\nlow run continuous black lines numbered 29.7, 29.8, 29.9, etc., which show\r\nwhere in the country the pressures are the same.\r\n\r\nAs the numbers run up to 30.0, 30.1, 30.2 they begin to circle about the\r\nword High which denotes where the pressure is highest. Little circles will\r\nbe observed on the map. Some are clear, indicating clear weather; others\r\nare half clear, half black, indicating partly cloudy conditions; others\r\nare all black, showing clouds; others have R. or S. inside them, telling\r\nwhere it is raining. The numbers under the circles show how much it has\r\nrained or snowed and the numbers under the other numbers are the\r\nvelocities of the winds. The arrows through the circles fly with the wind.\r\nA little zig-zag locates each thunderstorm and the shaded portions show\r\nover what portions of the country it has rained during the last 24 hours.\r\nAs an intelligent puzzle picture the map is unequaled and no wonder the\r\nchild likes it.\r\n\r\nWith this map you can tell at a glance what the weather is doing to your\r\nuncle in Tacoma and to your cousin in Missouri. With two successive maps\r\nyou can find out about how fast the storms are traveling, in what\r\ndirection, and how low the temperatures are under their influence, and so\r\nestimate for yourself the weather for the next three days.\r\n\r\nBesides the invaluable daily weather map the Bureau issues many other maps\r\nthat present the phenomena of the week, the month, and the season in\r\ngraphic form. Masters of vessels are now coöperating with the government\r\nto provide observations at sea, and both on our northwest and southeast\r\ncoasts such information is very valuable. In the west several hundreds of\r\nstations are maintained in the mountains for the purpose of obtaining the\r\ndepth and content of the great snowfalls there. Estimates can then be\r\ngiven out as to the amount of water to be available for irrigating\r\npurposes. In addition to the 220 stations of the first class there are\r\n4200 coöperative stations at which observations are made and mailed to 44\r\ncenters for distribution.\r\n\r\nSpecial local data help to establish the relations between climate and\r\nforestry, agriculture, water resources, and allied subjects. Many\r\nbulletins are compiled by experts in their respective lines and these are\r\nfor free distribution. A study of forest cover is being made in Colorado\r\nand the effects of denudation on the flow of streams will soon be\r\nscientifically established. As soon as practicable the Bureau hopes to\r\nextend its period of forecasting. Weekly forecasts have been tried in a\r\ngeneral way with success, but long-range forecasting depends upon so many\r\nrelationships of the air that present knowledge and facilities do not\r\nwarrant its adoption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nA CHAPTER OF EXPLOSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the good old times when a man was born, spent his life, and died in the\r\nsame village the weather proverb was fashioned. Generations had watched\r\nthe clouds gather under certain circumstances and scatter under certain\r\nothers and they naturally drew conclusions. These conclusions crystallized\r\nuntil they resembled nuggets of golden weather wisdom. Some were even used\r\nas charms. And all contained a deal of truth so long as they were only\r\nmeant to refer to the country in which they had originated.\r\n\r\nBut nowadays when the very idea of remaining in the same place for very\r\nlong at a time is obnoxious the weather proverb suffers. It suffers\r\nchiefly by transportation. The weather in County Cork is so very different\r\nfrom the weather that makes Chicago famous that the same weather lore does\r\nnot fit. Yet it is often applied. The old truths, treasured in picturesque\r\nphrase and jingle, were brought over the ocean unchanged and made to do\r\nduty,--a case of new wine in old bottles again, for a gentle old Irish\r\nproverb splits up the back when it tries to accommodate itself to a week\r\nof our reckless but magnificent weather.\r\n\r\nFairy stories are jewels to be cherished. And it is a careless and\r\nunimaginative race that perpetuates no legends. Even old saws are quaint\r\nand should be preserved: \"See a pin and pick it up, all the day you'll\r\nhave good luck.\" Let that sort of thing go on because it adds richness to\r\nour conversation. But if a thousand men, after having picked up their\r\nmorning pins, sat around waiting for the ensuing luck the progress of\r\nscientific business management would be halted. And precisely that way is\r\nthe knowledge of ordinary weather facts halted,--a full-grown superstition\r\nsits in the path. Instead of relying upon their eyes the majority of\r\npeople rely upon a bit of doggerel. For example, millions of people firmly\r\nbelieve that the ground-hog is a key to the weather. They say that if the\r\nground-hog does not see his shadow on the 2nd of February that winter is\r\nover!\r\n\r\nThis is the sort of thing that obscures the findings of science not to\r\nmention common-sense. Few of these people have ever seen a ground-hog.\r\nFew of the rest have ever studied its habits. The ant, the mouse, the fly,\r\nthe rat, and the mosquito have far more influence upon our lives than the\r\nground-hog has and the most ambitious animal cannot expect to influence\r\natmospheric pressure, which is responsible for our weather. Yet as often\r\nas the 2nd of February comes around the hopes of many are either dashed or\r\nraised according to the actions of this creature. As a matter of fact,\r\nwhether February 2nd is clear or cloudy can have no influence on the rest\r\nof the winter.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the other proverbs have a basis of reason. But this puts its\r\nbelievers in the wrong either way. If they say that it is the actions of\r\nthe animal that they rely upon they depend upon a characteristic\r\nthoroughly and surely disproved. No animal, although it may sense a change\r\nin the weather a few hours in advance, is able to feel it for three days\r\nahead to say nothing of six weeks. If these people say, on the other hand,\r\nthat a cloudy February 2nd means an immediate and complete let up of\r\nwinter, or that a clear February 2nd means a certain continuance of cold\r\nweather for six weeks, they have only to trouble themselves to look at the\r\nfiles of the nearest Weather Bureau for the last forty years. They will\r\nfind no connection. The trouble is that they will not look, but keep on\r\nrepeating the bit of nonsense and believing in it, although the strength\r\nof their convictions probably does not reduce their coal-bills.\r\n\r\nThe same people are fond of saying that the first three days of December\r\nshow what the winter will be like. That is, if the 1st is fair so will\r\nDecember be; if the 2nd is cold so will January be; and if it snows on the\r\n3rd, so will it snow in February. If all three should be clear and warm\r\ncertainly a remarkable winter would follow! No rain, no snow, no cold! You\r\nsee how absurd this superstition is.\r\n\r\n\"A dry moon lies on its back!\" After the ground-hog the moon is supposed\r\nto have the most influence on our seasons. The Government and many\r\nscientists connected with no governments have made careful, exhaustive and\r\nconclusive investigations. No relation between the moon and our weather\r\nhas been discovered except as she causes our tides and they affect\r\natmospheric pressure in an infinitesimal degree. We would still have just\r\nas much and just as variable weather if there were no moon. The weather\r\nchanges with the changing moon, and it does not change as the moon\r\nchanges, and the chances are about even that the times of change will\r\ncoincide. So there is, therefore, absolutely no foundation for the dozens\r\nof proverbs that yoke the changes of the moon with the changes of our\r\nweather. Neither in science nor in observation has any sequence been\r\ndeduced.\r\n\r\nSo the moon may lie on its back or on its side or stand on its head and\r\nthe weather will remain dry if no low pressure areas cross the country,\r\nand it can lie on its back for days and the country be drowned out if they\r\ndo. There are enough pretty things to say about the moon, anyway, and will\r\nbe more all the time for, to commit a paraphrase: Science is stranger than\r\nsuperstition.\r\n\r\n\"It will rain for forty days straight if it rains on St. Swithin's Day,\"\r\nwhich, I might as well say for the benefit of those who don't know their\r\nsaints, falls on July 15th every year. It would be interesting to know how\r\nmany people in a hundred really believe this, or really believe all the\r\nother things that are attributed to the saints,--quite a few, probably.\r\nLuckily for St. Swithin July and August are wet months, with often several\r\ndays of showers or thunderstorms in succession. But never once in\r\nPhiladelphia has it rained for forty days, one right after another,\r\nalthough half the July 15ths have been rained on. This proverb is one of\r\nthose that had better never been transplanted from its native Ireland\r\nwhere rain for 40 days would excite scarcely a curse.\r\n\r\n\"Long and loud singing of robins denotes rain.\" It does not. Oftener than\r\nnot it denotes the time of day. Just watch the robins and listen to them\r\nand see what they do before a storm, during it, after it, and then you\r\nwill see how little the songs of birds can be depended upon to supplant\r\nthe barometer.\r\n\r\n\"If March comes in like a lion it will go out like a lamb,\" and the other\r\nway round. I have seen March come in like a lion and go out like a lion,\r\ncome in like a lion and go out like a lamb, come in like a lamb and go out\r\nlike a lion, and come in like a lamb and go out like a Noah's ark. But I\r\nnever have seen March do anything dependable. It is quite impossible to\r\ntell how March is going out on March 27th, and absolutely impossible to\r\ntell on March 1st.\r\n\r\nBut there is this much observation expressed in the proverb, that March is\r\nso changeable that, if it comes in cold, windy, unsettled, there is not so\r\nmuch chance for such weather still to be going on at the end of the month,\r\nand still less in England where the proverb came from. This is a harmless\r\nproverb unless it should lead people to actually count upon a pleasant\r\nspring just because March had an unpleasant inception. Misfortunes rarely\r\ncome singly, even on the weather calendar.\r\n\r\n\"When squirrels are scarce in autumn the winter will be severe.\" Aside\r\nfrom the scientific truth that the animals cannot know in advance about\r\nthe seasons there is little evidence on either side to base a contention.\r\nNobody has made a squirrel census; nobody, probably, has found out whether\r\nthey increase in numbers for six years and then die off in great\r\nquantities as do the rabbits in the north country on the seventh; nobody\r\nhas connected their apparent numbers year after year with the actual\r\nseverities of the winters. And so nobody has a right to promulgate the\r\nreport (except as a bit of nonsense like April Fool) that the ensuing\r\nwinter is going to be a record breaker because the squirrels have\r\ndisappeared. It would be far truer to say that \"When squirrels are scarce\r\nin autumn the hunters have been busy,\" and let it go at that.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of proverbs in this connection about goose bones and\r\nhickory nuts and wild geese, which sound plausible but are never proved.\r\nIf the birds have all the sense credited to them it is strange that some\r\nallow themselves to be caught by an early snowstorm in the fall and\r\ndecimated. Also it is not uncommon for early migrations in the spring to\r\narrive in the north to be slain by the thousand by a belated blizzard. It\r\nis granted that animals and birds, having a far greater sensitiveness than\r\nman, occasionally sense a catastrophe some hours before it is evidenced by\r\nany visual signs, but seasonal wisdom has not been proved in any one\r\ninstance and disproved in many. None of the proverbs relating to the\r\nanimals and birds are to be depended upon. They deceive, much to the\r\nregret of all the meteorologists who would welcome any genuine clue to\r\nnature of the coming season. Any farmer would be only too glad to keep a\r\nmenagerie of squirrels and wild geese and toads if only he might be\r\nassured by them of the coming seasonal conditions.\r\n\r\nThe proverbs given indicate the range, possibly, but certainly not the\r\nfull absurdity of the old weather sayings. There are many other proverbs\r\nthat contain at least a half truth.\r\n\r\n\"Enough blue sky to make a Dutchman's breeches indicates clearing,\" is one\r\nthat is true if the wind has changed to the west. If the wind still blows\r\nfrom an easterly quarter blue sky for a Dutchman's whole wardrobe would\r\nnot insure clear weather. All sayings must be tested many times before\r\nthey are believed implicitly.\r\n\r\n\"There is always a thaw in January,\" is about as true a generalization as\r\ncan be made about things for which generalizations are never strictly in\r\nplace. Even in Canada the severity of the winter is often broken by a\r\nspell of warmer weather with a rain, perhaps, in the dead of winter. In\r\nthe United States a winter without some break in each of the months would\r\nbe a most unusual occurrence. So that it is quite reasonable to expect the\r\n\"January thaw\" any time from Christmas until the middle of February.\r\n\r\n\"A late spring never deceives,\" unless it is so very late, like the\r\nphenomenal spring of 1907, that the jump is made, perforce, into summer.\r\nThat is a cruel deception. What is meant of course is that if the freezing\r\nweather continues consistently, well past the average, the likelihood of\r\nfrost-damage to fruit is slight. There is nothing much worse than for the\r\nblossoms to be forced by a period of warm weather early, for there is only\r\na slim chance that it will continue past the danger limit. It is\r\nsurprising how late frost may occur,--the last date for killing frost in\r\nPennsylvania is about May 10th on the _average_, which makes it possible\r\ntill June.\r\n\r\n\"The first robins indicate the approach of spring.\" But certainly not its\r\narrival.\r\n\r\n\"If the moon rises clear expect fair weather.\" Right; because if it is\r\nsummer even the eastern horizon would show the humidity necessary enough\r\nto cause a thunderstorm, and in winter the cirrus clouds give several\r\nhours' warning. But, again, the wind is the chief factor to be considered.\r\n\r\nProverbs, representing variations of the truth, could be given about every\r\nmanifestation of the skies as well as about things that were never\r\nmanifest except in the imagination, for every country has contributed to\r\nthe volume of weather-lore. But, unfortunately, neither age nor amount of\r\nrepetition are as good as the truth and they should be discarded if they\r\nare false. The way to discard is not to repeat.\r\n\r\nThe man who desires weather-wisdom should seek it with his eyes. His\r\ncomparison will be that which he sees with that which he has seen, and he\r\nwill soon form all the weather axioms he needs for himself. The local\r\nBureau or the Bureau at Washington will answer all his inquiries,\r\ncheerfully, promptly, and free of charge. Of course there are things that\r\nthe Bureau wants to know itself. It is very curious about the higher\r\nstrata of air. Small balloons have carried very light instruments to an\r\naltitude of fifteen miles and brought considerable knowledge to earth,\r\nbut each bit makes more knowledge imperative.\r\n\r\nThe cry of \"last frontier\" hurts the adventurous, the exploring, the\r\nwoods-loving as no other cry has power to hurt. With the Poles gone and\r\nAlaska in harness we are inclined to think that it is all over. We resign\r\nourselves to our trammelling globe,--as the gold-fish do,--forgetting. But\r\nthere is plenty of interest left. The birds must be brought back. Forests\r\nmust be made and patrolled, and the air-ocean is still unknown. That, at\r\nany rate, has remained unspoiled by man.\r\n\r\nThe seas have been charted and the mountains have been disemboweled, but\r\nthe atmosphere is unconquered. More must be known. Squadrons of aëroplanes\r\ncannot ride out the gale until their pilots know all about the gale. Until\r\nthat time there need be no cry of last frontier, for until that time the\r\nweather will continue to be our overlord, whose dominions are flaunted\r\nbefore the watcher on the porch and the runner on the trail.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDENSATIONS\r\n\r\nLook for continued fair weather when:\r\n\r\nA gentle wind blows from the west, northwest, or a little south of west.\r\n\r\nThe sun sets in a cloudless sky.\r\n\r\nThe sunset is composed of light tints, inclining to red or yellow.\r\n\r\nThe sunset is followed by a glowing and slow-fading western sky.\r\n\r\nThe sun sets like a ball of fire (warmer).\r\n\r\nThe sun rises out of a gray sky.\r\n\r\nThe clouds are noticeably high for the season.\r\n\r\nThe clouds rise on the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe clouds have frequent breaks showing blue sky between.\r\n\r\nThe puffy cumulus clouds show a lot of white.\r\n\r\nThe cumulus clouds decrease toward nightfall.\r\n\r\nThe winter sky is mottled with a northwest wind.\r\n\r\nThe summer morning fog breaks before ten o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe dawn is low.\r\n\r\nThe blue sky has a tendency to show green near the northern horizon\r\n(colder).\r\n\r\nThe sun breaks through a departing thunderstorm and makes a rainbow.\r\n\r\nSnow-flurries drift down a north wind (colder).\r\n\r\nCirrus clouds, or others, dissolve, or cirrus have tails down.\r\n\r\nSpiders spin on the grass.\r\n\r\nThere is a moderate dew or frost.\r\n\r\nThe temperature is normal or colder than normal, other signs being right.\r\n\r\nThe sky is sown with stars.\r\n\r\nThe moon rises clear.\r\n\r\nThe wind blows down mountain ravines after nightfall.\r\n\r\nThe salt is dry, smoke ascends, birds fly high, and animals act normally.\r\n\r\nThe barometer rises slowly, or is steady at or above 30.00.\r\n\r\nNo change need be feared as the anticyclone nears, or for three days after\r\nclear conditions are established so long as the wind remains brisk from\r\nsome westerly quarter. The direction of the wind, the kind of cloud, and\r\nthe temperature changes are the factors to watch if you have no barometer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLook for a change toward storms when:\r\n\r\nThe west wind suddenly drops.\r\n\r\nThe west wind shifts to south or northeast.\r\n\r\nThe cirrus clouds appear in well-organized lines.\r\n\r\nThe cirrus clouds merge into cirro-stratus.\r\n\r\nThe sky looks like fish scales, so-called mackerel sky.\r\n\r\nLight scud drifts across the sky from east to west.\r\n\r\nThe summer cumulus clouds increase in size as the afternoon proceeds.\r\n\r\nWalls grow damp, flies are more of a burden than usual, swallows fly low.\r\n\r\nSmoke falls to the ground.\r\n\r\nThere have been three white frosts.\r\n\r\nA halo appears around either the moon or sun.\r\n\r\nWhen sun-dogs appear about the sun, denoting ice-particles in the air.\r\n\r\nThe summer morning is sultry and the wind variable.\r\n\r\nThe temperature is much above the normal.\r\n\r\nFew stars are visible and those are indistinct. The clouds gather about\r\nthe mountain tops, or drop down the mountain-sides.\r\n\r\nThe wind continues to blow up ravines after nightfall.\r\n\r\nThe sunset is a dull gray, or the sun sets into a livid cloudbank.\r\n\r\nThe sunrise is a fiery red, and the dawn is high.\r\n\r\nThe sun gradually is smothered in fine-textured clouds and the wind\r\nshifts.\r\n\r\nThe temperature does not fall at night.\r\n\r\nThe signs most to be heeded are the shift of wind to a point east of\r\nnorth or south, the gradual filming of the sky with cirrus and\r\ncirro-stratus, and the increase of temperature. Of course, the barometer\r\nis the best indicator of all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLook for a change toward clearing when:\r\n\r\nThe wind shifts from the easterly quarter into the west.\r\n\r\nThe temperature falls rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe clouds rise, or break, or lighten perceptibly in color.\r\n\r\nPatches of blue sky appear through the rifts in the clouds, wind north.\r\n\r\nRaindrops grow smaller after the windshift.\r\n\r\nSnowflakes drive less busily, float lazily down, or thin out\r\nconspicuously.\r\n\r\nSeams appear in the clouds, snow will cease and rain probably.\r\n\r\nThe thunder and lightning occur only in the eastern quarter.\r\n\r\nPermanent clearing will not be effected until the change of the wind to\r\nthe points on the western half of the compass show that the cyclone has\r\ndefinitely passed to the north or south or over the locality. In winter\r\nthe cloud covering may move off slowly, but there will be little\r\nprecipitation after the wind has reached north or west. The bank of\r\ncirro-stratus gets thinner and the moon or the sun gradually shines\r\nthrough. In summer clearing is much more abrupt, as is the clouding up.\r\nThe ability to sense accurately the moment when the weights are shifted\r\nand the change to clearing commences takes some observation to acquire,\r\nbut the advantage is worth it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRain (or snow) will fall:\r\n\r\nWithin five minutes after the arch of the thundercloud is seen to move\r\ntoward one.\r\n\r\nWithin five minutes when the curtain of falling drops obscures the\r\nlandscape to the west of one.\r\n\r\nWithin a few minutes after the bottoms of cumulus clouds turn from black\r\nto gray, letting down visible trailing showers.\r\n\r\nWithin a short while after the winter sky has become uniform in color.\r\n\r\nWithin an hour after the pavement-like, but scarcely discernible,\r\nthundercloud consolidates along the west, if the wind is from the\r\nsouthwest. If the wind is from the southeast this cloud may take four\r\nhours to rise.\r\n\r\nFrom two to eight hours after the sun or moon has vanished behind the\r\ncirro-stratus.\r\n\r\nFrom eight to forty-eight hours after the first cirrus is seen, depending\r\nupon the distance from the sea and the time of year.\r\n\r\nEvery little while from southwest showers in the passing of a summer low.\r\n\r\nFor about eight to twelve hours continuously in a winter storm, and\r\nintermittently until the wind swings west.\r\n\r\nFor a very short while from a thunder cloud rising on a west wind.\r\n\r\nFor an hour or more from a thundercloud that rises on a southwest or\r\nsoutheast wind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe temperature will fall when:\r\n\r\nA thunderstorm breaks, continuing low if the wind blows from the west\r\nafter clearing.\r\n\r\nNightfall approaches and the sky is free from clouds.\r\n\r\nThe mercury remains at the same level during the sunny hours.\r\n\r\nA cyclone is departing and the anticyclone moving in.\r\n\r\nThe wind swings north of east in a storm,--the fall will be gradual.\r\n\r\nThe wind swings west of south in a storm,--the fall will be sudden.\r\n\r\nA snowstorm begins, for a short time only.\r\n\r\nA cloudy day clears at sunset.\r\n\r\nSnow flurries are seen.\r\n\r\nThe sky shows green and the clouds look hard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe temperature will rise when:\r\n\r\nA thunderstorm is brewing, or a day or two before a winter cyclone.\r\n\r\nAfter a thunderstorm if another is to follow.\r\n\r\nThe morning is free from clouds and if it is not the first day of a cold\r\nwave.\r\n\r\nThe wind dips south of west or south of northeast, the former shift\r\nbringing the more sudden rise.\r\n\r\nThe sun sets as a ball of fire, at which one can easily look.\r\n\r\nA snowstorm gets under way, unless the wind is swinging toward the north.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PAGE OF PROBLEMS\r\n\r\nOne satisfying thing about meteorology is that there is a constantly\r\nwidening field for conquest. Among the questions that await solution are:\r\n\r\nWhat are the relative densities of clouds?\r\n\r\nWhat is the original atmospheric electricity, its distribution and laws?\r\n\r\nWhat are the causes and nature of precipitation?\r\n\r\nWill aërial ascents on all sides of an atmospheric disturbance discover\r\nthe mechanism of storms?\r\n\r\nWhat relations are there of solar radiation to our atmosphere?\r\n\r\nWhat influence do lunar tides bear to our weather?\r\n\r\nOn what does the permanence of the summer lows over the Rockies depend?\r\n\r\nThese questions are only samples. Many certainties can be attained by\r\nmerely complete observations over a longer period of time, others by new\r\nsystems of observations that await a more generous appropriation. Even the\r\nupper air investigations on Mt. Weather, Va., have had to be curtailed.\r\nThe Bureau's record has proved it efficient, of enormous benefit to the\r\ncountry, and deserving of the encouragement instead of the depreciation of\r\nevery citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT THE WEATHER FLAGS MEAN\r\n\r\nIn every city the Bureau causes flags to be flown from some prominent\r\nplace so that a glance may show shippers and everybody who may be\r\nconcerned at the shortest possible notice just what the approaching\r\nweather conditions are.\r\n\r\nA plain white flag means fair weather.\r\n\r\nA black triangle stands for temperature and is always exhibited with some\r\nother flag. Its relative position, either above or below indicates higher\r\nor lower temperature. Therefore white flag with the black below means fair\r\nand colder. The white flag with the black above means fair and warmer.\r\n\r\nA white flag with a black square in the center means a cold wave.\r\n\r\nA blue flag means either rain or snow.\r\n\r\nThe blue with the black above would mean rain or snow and warmer.\r\n\r\nThe blue with the black below would mean rain or snow and colder.\r\n\r\nA blue and white flag means a local shower. The same meanings are attached\r\nto the black triangle in connection with the blue and white.\r\n\r\nA red triangle indicates a dangerous local storm, is called the\r\ninformation flag meaning that shippers should apply to the Bureau for news\r\nof the direction in which the storm is travelling.\r\n\r\nA red square with a black center means severe winds.\r\n\r\n1. Southwesterly with a white triangle below.\r\n\r\n2. Northwesterly with a white triangle above.\r\n\r\n3. Northeasterly with a red triangle above.\r\n\r\n4. Southeasterly with a red triangle below.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR FOUR WORLD'S RECORDS,--AND OTHERS\r\n\r\nMaximum Temperature\r\n\r\n    United States, 134 at Greenland Ranch, Cal., July, 1913.\r\n\r\n    World, 134 at Greenland Ranch, Cal.\r\n\r\nMinimum Temperature\r\n\r\n    United States, -65 at Miles City, Mont., January, 1888.\r\n\r\n    World, -98 at Verkhojansk, Siberia.\r\n\r\nAbsolute Zero of Space\r\n\r\n    -459 degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nMaximum Annual Precipitation\r\n\r\n    United States, 167.29 inches at Glenora, Oreg., in 1896.\r\n\r\n    World, 905.1 inches, Cherrapunji, India, 1861.\r\n\r\nMaximum Monthly Precipitation\r\n\r\n    United States, 71.5 inches at Helen Mine, Cal., January, 1909.\r\n\r\n    World, 366 inches, Cherrapunji, India, July, 1861.\r\n\r\nMaximum 24 Hour Precipitation\r\n\r\n    United States, 21 inches at Alexandria, La.\r\n\r\nMinimum Annual Precipitation\r\n\r\n    United States, none at Bagdad, Cal., in 1913.

EXTRA\r\n\r\nTHE NUMBERS MAKE ORDERING EASY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. EXERCISE AND HEALTH, by Dr. Woods Hutchinson. Dr. Hutchinson takes the\r\ncommon-sense view that the greatest problem in exercise for most of us is\r\nto get enough of the right kind. The greatest error in exercise is not to\r\ntake enough, and the greatest danger in athletics is in giving them up. He\r\nwrites in a direct matter-of-fact manner with an avoidance of medical\r\nterms, and a strong emphasis on the rational, all-round manner of living\r\nthat is best calculated to bring a man to a ripe old age with little\r\nillness or consciousness of bodily weakness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n2. CAMP COOKERY, by Horace Kephart. \"The less a man carries in his pack\r\nthe more he must carry in his head,\" says Mr. Kephart. This book tells\r\nwhat a man should carry in both pack and head. Every step is traced--the\r\nselection of provisions and utensils, with the kind and quantity of each,\r\nthe preparation of game, the building of fires, the cooking of every\r\nconceivable kind of food that the camp outfit or woods, fields or streams\r\nmay provide--even to the making of desserts. Every recipe is the result of\r\nhard practice and long experience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n3. BACKWOODS SURGERY AND MEDICINE, by Charles S. Moody, M. D.

The fundamental principle can be learned in ten\r\nminutes and its application is far easier than that of any other code now\r\nin use. It permits also the use of cipher and can be adapted to almost any\r\nimaginable conditions of weather, light, or topography.\r\n\r\n12. TRACKS AND TRACKING, by Josef Brunner. After twenty years of patient\r\nstudy and practical experience, Mr. Brunner can, from his intimate\r\nknowledge, speak with authority on this subject. \"Tracks and Tracking\"\r\nshows how to follow intelligently even the most intricate animal or bird\r\ntracks.

The\r\nauthor regards the house and grounds as a complete unit and shows how the\r\nbest results may be obtained by carrying the reader in detail through the\r\nvarious phases of designing the garden, with the levels and contours\r\nnecessary, laying out the walks and paths, planning and placing the\r\narbors, summer houses, seats, etc., and selecting and placing trees,\r\nshrubs, vines and flowers. Ideal plans for plots of various sizes are\r\nappended, as well as suggestions for correcting mistakes that have been\r\nmade through \"starting wrong.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n25. FISHING WITH FLOATING FLIES, by Samuel G. Camp. This is an art that is\r\ncomparatively new in this country although English anglers have used the\r\ndry fly for generations. Mr. Camp has given the matter special study and\r\nis one of the few American anglers who really understands the matter from\r\nthe selection of the outfit to the landing of the fish. His book takes up\r\nthe process in that order, namely--How to Outfit for Dry Fly Fishing--How,\r\nWhere, and When to Cast--The Selection and Use of Floating Flies--Dry Fly\r\nFishing for Brook, Brown and Rainbow Trout--Hooking, Playing and\r\nLanding--Practical Hints on Dry Fly Fishing.\r\n\r\n26. THE GASOLINE MOTOR, by Harold Whiting Slauson. Deals with the\r\npractical problems of motor operation.
