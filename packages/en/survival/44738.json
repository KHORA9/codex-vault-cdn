The Name Devonshire.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word \"shire,\" which is probably derived, like \"shear\" and \"share,\"\r\nfrom an Anglo-Saxon root meaning \"to cut,\" was at one time used in\r\na wider sense than it is at present, and was formerly applied to a\r\ndivision of a county or even of a town. Thus, there were once six small\r\n\"shires\" in Cornwall.\r\n\r\nThe word shire was in use at the time of King Ina, and occurs in the\r\ncode of laws which that monarch drew up about the year 709; but the\r\nactual division of England into shires was a gradual process, and was\r\nnot complete at the Norman Conquest. Lancashire, for example, was not\r\nconstituted a shire until the twelfth century. Alterations in the extent\r\nand limits of some of the counties are, indeed, still being made; and in\r\nthe case of Devonshire the boundaries have been changed several times\r\nwithin the memory of persons still living.\r\n\r\nThe object of thus dividing up the country was partly military and\r\npartly financial. Every shire was bound to provide a certain number of\r\narmed men to fight the king's battles, and was also bound to contribute\r\na certain sum of money towards his income and the expenses of the state;\r\nand in each district a \"shire-reeve\"--or sheriff, as we call the officer\r\nnow--was appointed by the Crown to see that the people did their duty\r\nin both respects. The shire was a Saxon institution. County is a Norman\r\nword, which came into use after the Conquest, when the government of\r\neach shire was entrusted to some powerful noble, often a count, a title\r\nwhich originally meant a companion of the King.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that the reason why the names of some counties end\r\nor may end in \"shire,\" while in other cases this syllable is never used,\r\nis that the former were \"shorn off\" from some larger district, while the\r\nlatter represent entire ancient kingdoms or tribal divisions. According\r\nto this theory, Yorkshire is a \"shire\" because it originally formed\r\npart of the kingdom of Northumbria; and Kent is not a \"shire\" because\r\nit practically represents the ancient kingdom of the Cantii. The form\r\n\"Kent-shire\" is, however, found in a record of the time of Athelstan.\r\n\r\nIn the case of our own county both forms are in use, and we say\r\neither \"Devon\" or \"Devonshire,\" although the two names are not\r\nexactly interchangeable. Thus, while we generally talk of \"Red Devon\"\r\ncattle, we always speak of \"Devonshire\" cream. \"Devon,\" which is the\r\nolder form, may be derived either from _Dumnonii_, the name given by\r\nPtolemy, an Alexandrian geographer of the second century, to the\r\ninhabitants of the south-west of Britain, perhaps from a Celtic word\r\n_Dumnos_, \"people\"--or it may come from the old Welsh word _Dyvnaint_\r\nor _Dyfneint_, \"the land of the deeps,\" that is to say, of deep valleys\r\nor deep seas. To the Saxon settlers the people they found in possession\r\nof the district were _Defn-saetan_ or \"dwellers in Devon\"; and in time\r\nthese settlers called themselves _Defenas_, or \"men of Devon.\" In the\r\nExeter Domesday Book--the Norman survey of the five south-western\r\ncounties, completed probably before 1086--the name of the county is\r\ngiven as _Devenesira_. It would appear, then, that the Britons called\r\ntheir province \"Devon,\" and that the Saxons called it \"Devonshire.\" It\r\nis characteristic of the peaceable nature of the Saxon occupation that\r\nthe two names, like the two nations, seem to have quietly settled down\r\nside by side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Devonshire in the Exeter Domesday Book]\r\n\r\nIt is believed that it was Alfred the Great who marked out the\r\nborder-line between Devon and Somerset; and it was undoubtedly Athelstan\r\nwho, after his victory over the West Welsh, made the Tamar the boundary\r\nbetween Devon and Cornwall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. General Characteristics.\r\n\r\n\r\nDevonshire is a county in the extreme south-west of England, occupying\r\nthe greater part of the peninsula between the English and Bristol\r\nChannels, and having a coast-line both on the south and on the north.\r\nSituated thus, on two seas, and possessing, especially on its southern\r\nsea-board, a remarkable number of bays and estuaries, it has always been\r\nnoted as a maritime county. And although many of its harbours have, in\r\nthe lapse of ages, become silted up with sand or shingle, and are now of\r\ncomparatively slight importance, it has one great sea-port, which, while\r\nonly thirtieth in rank among British commercial ports, is the greatest\r\nnaval station in the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe county has in the past been famous for its cloth-weaving and for its\r\ntin and copper-mining, but these industries are now greatly decayed, and\r\nthe main occupation of the people is agriculture, to which both the soil\r\nand the climate are particularly favourable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: King Tor, near Tavistock]\r\n\r\nA special characteristic of Devonshire is its scenery, which is so\r\nstriking that it is very generally considered the most beautiful\r\ncounty in England; while there are probably very many who regard its\r\nmild and genial, equable and health-giving climate as more noteworthy\r\nstill. It is a remarkably hilly country, and it also possesses not\r\nonly many rivers, but a great number of broad river estuaries. Another\r\ncharacteristic with which every visitor to the district is struck is the\r\nredness which distinguishes its soil, its southern cliffs, and its\r\nfamous breed of cattle, which is not less noticeable than the soft and\r\npleasant dialect, with its close sound of the letter \"u\" so typical both\r\nof Devon and of West Somerset.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Typical Devon Stream--Watersmeet, Lynmouth]\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic of the people has always been their loyalty\r\nto their sovereign, to their county, and to each other. Devon is\r\nproverbial, like Cornwall and Yorkshire, for the clannishness of its\r\ninhabitants. It is a land, too, where superstition dies hard. Belief\r\nin pixies--fairies, as they are called elsewhere--in witches and\r\nwitch-craft, in whisht-hounds and other weird and uncanny creatures, and\r\nin portents and omens, still lingers, especially on Dartmoor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Devon Valley--Yawl Bottom, Uplyme]\r\n\r\nDartmoor itself, with its wild and picturesque scenery, its unrivalled\r\nwealth of prehistoric antiquities, and its singular geological\r\nstructure, forms one of the most striking features of the county, and\r\none to which there is no parallel in England. The marine zoology of\r\nDevonshire is more interesting than that of any other English county,\r\nand nowhere else in the island has there been discovered clearer\r\nevidence of the great antiquity of man than was found in Kent's Cavern\r\nand other Devonshire caves.\r\n\r\nAbove all things, its position has made Devonshire a native land of\r\nheroes. Very few other counties have produced so many men of mark, so\r\nmany men of enterprise and daring. Certainly no other has played a\r\ngreater part in the expansion of England. From Devonshire came not only\r\nsome of the most distinguished seamen of the Golden Age of Elizabeth,\r\nsome of the most skilful and daring of her naval captains, but some of\r\nthe earliest and most famous of our explorers; the founder of the first\r\nEnglish colony, the first Englishman to sail the polar sea, the first\r\nEnglishman to circumnavigate the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Size. Shape. Boundaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nDevonshire, which occupies rather more than one-twenty-second of the\r\nwhole area of England and Wales, is one of the largest counties in the\r\nBritish Islands, being exceeded in size only by Yorkshire and Lincoln in\r\nEngland, by Inverness and Argyll in Scotland, and by Cork in Ireland.\r\nIts extreme length from east to west, measured along a horizontal line\r\ndrawn through the middle of the county, starting at the Dorsetshire\r\nborder half-way between Lyme Cobb and the Seven Rocks Point, passing\r\nclose to the city of Exeter, and reaching to the point where the river\r\nOttery enters the county, is 67 miles; exactly the same as that of the\r\ncounty of Somerset. Its greatest breadth, from Countisbury Foreland on\r\nthe north coast to Prawle Point on the south, is 71 miles. It may be\r\nadded that a longer east and west line can be drawn only in Yorkshire\r\nand Sussex, and a longer meridional line only in Yorkshire and Lincoln.\r\nThe area of the \"Ancient\" or \"Geographical\" county of Devonshire,\r\naccording to the revised return furnished by the Ordnance Department,\r\nis 1,667,154 acres, or 2605 square miles. Compared with the counties\r\nthat adjoin it, it is two-and-a-half times the size of Dorset, it is\r\nroughly twice as large as Cornwall, and it is more than half as large\r\nagain as Somerset. It is fifteen times as large as Rutland, it is\r\nabout half the size of Yorkshire, and its area is less than that of\r\nLincolnshire by only 48 square miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Glen Lyn, near Lynmouth]\r\n\r\nAlthough usually said to be irregular in form, the outline of the\r\ncounty has a certain degree of symmetry, being roughly shaped like a\r\nlife-guardsman's cuirass, with nearly equal sides, with a small hollow\r\nat the top or north coast, and a much larger one at the bottom or south\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nDevonshire, like Kent and Cornwall, is bounded on two sides by the sea,\r\nhaving the Bristol Channel on the north and north-west, and the English\r\nChannel on the south. On its western side the river Tamar, with its\r\ntributary the Ottery, forms almost the whole of the frontier between it\r\nand Cornwall. The eastern and north-eastern border is less definite,\r\nbut is roughly marked by Exmoor and the Blackdown Hills, which partly\r\nseparate Devonshire from Somerset. The short length of frontier between\r\nDevonshire and Dorsetshire is marked by no natural feature.\r\n\r\nNo part of Devonshire is now, as was formerly the case, wholly\r\nsurrounded by any other county. Three of its parishes, however, are\r\npartly in Dorset, one is partly in Cornwall, and one, a district of\r\nExmoor containing no houses or inhabitants, is partly in Somerset.\r\nCulmstock, which before 1842 was considered to belong to Somerset,\r\nalthough completely islanded in Devon, and Stockland and Dalwood, which\r\nwere reckoned with Dorset, although they were entirely inside the\r\nDevonshire border, have now been formally transferred to this county. On\r\nthe other hand, Thornecombe and Ford Abbey, which belonged to Devonshire\r\nalthough they were situate in the adjoining county, have been handed\r\nover to Dorset. Still later alterations were the transfer of Hawkchurch\r\nand Churchstanton from Dorset to Devon in 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Surface and General Features.\r\n\r\n\r\nDevonshire is characterised by such great irregularity and unevenness of\r\nsurface that practically the only level land in it is along the shores\r\nof its estuaries; with the almost inevitable result that it is one of\r\nthe most picturesque and beautiful counties in England. Its scenery has\r\nbeen very greatly affected by subterranean movements, which have not\r\nonly roughly shaped its hills and valleys, partly by upheaval and partly\r\nby the shrinkage of the earth's crust, but have been the principal cause\r\nof the breadth of the river estuaries which are so marked a feature of\r\nits coasts, especially of the south. At many points along the shore of\r\nDevonshire there is evidence, in raised sea-beaches, and, near Torquay,\r\nin the borings of marine mollusca at a great height above the present\r\ntide-line, of upheavals that must have raised the whole coast, even if\r\nthey did not materially change the contour of the country. On the other\r\nhand, the existence of submerged forests at many places near the shore\r\nproves that the land has sunk at least forty feet, thus allowing the sea\r\nto flow further inland; thereby greatly widening the already existing\r\nvalleys, which had been formed in part by the shrinkage of the earth's\r\ncrust, and in part by the action of the rivers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Upper Dart, from the Moors]\r\n\r\nThe chief physical feature of Devonshire, a feature without parallel in\r\nany other part of England, is the Forest of Dartmoor, the great upland,\r\nsome twenty miles long and eighteen miles broad, which occupies so\r\nlarge a part of the southern half of the county. It is all granite,\r\nthe largest mass of granite in England, and forms part of a chain of\r\noutcrops of that formation extending from Devonshire to the Scilly\r\nIsles. The word \"forest,\" it should be remembered, originally meant,\r\nnot a wood, but a hunting-ground. No part of the open moor is now covered\r\nwith trees, nor is it likely, considering the poorness of the soil,\r\nthat it ever was so covered, although roots and other remains of trees\r\nhave been found in various parts of it. In early days it was a royal\r\nhunting-ground, and most of it is still Crown property, forming part\r\nof the Duchy of Cornwall.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent feature of the moor, which contains the highest\r\nground in England south of Ingleborough in Yorkshire, are the isolated\r\nrocky heights called tors, some 170 in number, many of which have been\r\nweathered, not only into very rugged and highly picturesque, but even\r\ninto most strange and fantastic shapes; in many cases having their\r\nsteep slopes strewn with fallen fragments of rock, some of them tons in\r\nweight, forming what are known on the moor as \"clitters\" or \"clatters.\"\r\nThe highest points are High Willhays, 2039 feet; Yes Tor, 2029 feet,\r\nonly half a mile away from its rival, Newlake, 1983 feet; Cuthill, 1980\r\nfeet; and Great Lynx Tor, 1908 feet above sea-level; and among the most\r\nstriking and picturesque are Great Lynx Tor, Staple Tor, Mis Tor, and\r\nVixen Tor, although many others are remarkable for their strange and\r\ntime-worn outlines.\r\n\r\nThe moor is seamed by many valleys and ravines, not a few of which are,\r\nin parts, well-wooded, each with its swiftly-flowing stream or river,\r\nand many of them most picturesque and beautiful. Such, in particular,\r\nare the Valley of the Dart, especially including Holne Chase and above;\r\nof the Teign near Fingle Bridge; of the Tavy at Tavy Cleave; of the Lyd\r\nat Lydford, and of the Plym at the Dewerstone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tavy Cleave, showing disintegrated granite]\r\n\r\nDartmoor is distinguished in being the coldest and rainiest part\r\nof Devonshire, and to these two features of its climate are no doubt\r\nlargely due the fogs which so frequently envelope it. Its great extent\r\nand its heavy rainfall make the moor the main watershed of the county.\r\nMost of its rivers have their sources in the bogs, which are a well-known\r\nand somewhat dangerous feature of the district, and of which the most\r\nremarkable are Fox Tor Mire, Cranmere Bog, and Cuthill Bog.\r\n\r\nIts varied and peculiar features, its vast expanses of wild and desolate\r\nmoorland, now aglow with golden gorse, and now still more splendid\r\nwith the magnificent purple of its broad sheets of heather or with the\r\nwarm hues of dying bracken, and beautiful, as the seasons change, with\r\nthe varying tints of grass and sedge, of ferns and rushes, of moss\r\nand bog-myrtle and bilberry, of cotton-grass and asphodel; the almost\r\nunrivalled beauty of its river-valleys, its multitudinous streams, its\r\nwild life, its extraordinary wealth of prehistoric antiquities, its\r\nlingering superstitions of pixies, of witch-craft, of night-flying\r\nwhisht-hounds and ghostly huntsmen, its very solitude and silence,\r\ncombine to make Dartmoor, to the antiquary and the artist, the\r\nnaturalist and the angler, one of the most attractive spots in England,\r\nand one whose charm poets, painters, and authors have striven from\r\nearliest days to immortalise.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of Exmoor, and all its principal heights, are in\r\nSomerset, but it extends into the north-eastern corner of Devon, and\r\ndetached portions of it, which appear to be really parts of the same\r\nupland, reach to the hills above Combe Martin. Part of Span Head, whose\r\nsummit is 1619 feet above the sea, is in our county; and the outlying\r\nspurs of Bratton Down, Kentisbury Down, and the Great Hangman are\r\nall over 1000 feet high. There is very beautiful scenery on Exmoor,\r\nespecially on the Somerset side of the border, somewhat resembling that\r\non Dartmoor, although less wild and picturesque, and without any of the\r\ntors which are so characteristic of the greater upland. Exmoor is the\r\nonly part of England where red deer still run wild; and the district\r\nis visited every year by stag-hunters from all parts of the island and\r\nespecially from Ireland. Both it and Dartmoor are famous for a breed\r\nof sturdy little ponies, originally, no doubt, of the same stock. In\r\nthe Badgeworthy Valley, which is in Somerset, although not far from\r\nLynton, may be seen what are said to be the ruined huts of the Doones, a\r\ncommunity of freebooters immortalised by Blackmore, who represents them\r\nas having been the terror of the country-side towards the close of the\r\nseventeenth century.\r\n\r\nOther Devonshire hills are the Black Downs, along the border of\r\nSomerset, in which the highest point is 860 feet above the sea; another\r\nBlack Down, six miles due south, reaching 930 feet; the Great Haldons,\r\nsouth-west of Exeter, 817 feet high; and Dumpdon Hill, about two miles\r\nnorth by east of Honiton, 856 feet above sea-level.\r\n\r\nDevonshire is in parts extremely fertile, especially towards the south,\r\nand it has been called (in common, it is true, with other counties) the\r\nGarden of England. Two very large and specially productive areas are\r\nthe Vale of Exeter, and the South Hams,--the latter a name somewhat\r\nindefinitely applied to the district south of Dartmoor and occupying\r\na large part of the region between the Teign and the Plym, with\r\nKingsbridge as its chief centre. The great fertility of this famous\r\ndistrict is due partly to the nature of the soil, partly to the mildness\r\nof the climate and the shelter afforded by the heights of Dartmoor,\r\nand partly to its nearness to the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: On Lundy]\r\n\r\nA very remarkable and interesting feature of Devonshire is Lundy--an\r\nisland three miles long by one mile broad, lying out in the Bristol\r\nChannel, opposite Barnstaple Bay, and twelve miles north-north-west of\r\nHartland Point. Its name, it is believed, is derived from two Norse\r\nwords meaning Puffin Isle.\r\n\r\nComposed entirely of granite, except for its southern extremity,\r\nwhich is millstone grit, its lofty cliffs are very wild and rugged\r\nand picturesque, and for two miles along its eastern side there is a\r\nremarkable series of chasms, from three to twenty feet wide and some\r\nof them of great depth, known to the islanders as the Earthquakes. The\r\nshingle beach at the south-eastern corner, in the shelter of Rat Island,\r\nis the only landing-place, but many vessels find good anchorage on the\r\neastern side, well protected from westerly winds. Many ships, however,\r\nhave been wrecked among the terrible rocks round its base, including the\r\nbattleship _Montagu_, lost in 1906, and, according to tradition, one of\r\nthe galleons of the Spanish Armada. There is a lighthouse at each end of\r\nthe island, and the southern one is the most powerful in Devonshire.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest charm of Lundy lies, as will be shown in some\r\ndetail in a later chapter, in its natural history, especially in the\r\nvast numbers of birds which visit it in the breeding season. Among\r\nvery rare stragglers that have been shot here is the Iceland falcon,\r\na species of which very few examples have been recorded for this\r\ncountry. A few plants and insects are peculiar to the spot. There are\r\nnow few trees, except those planted not long ago near the owner's\r\nhouse in a cleft at the south-eastern end, but some shrubs, such as\r\nfuchsias, hydrangeas, and rhododendrons grow to a great size, and the\r\nmesembryanthemums are particularly vigorous and beautiful.\r\n\r\nGranite for the Thames Embankment was obtained here, but the quarries\r\nhave long been closed, and farming is the chief industry of the few\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nThere are evidences of very ancient occupation, in the shape of\r\nkistvaens, tumuli, and the foundations of primitive dwellings; and in\r\ntimes more recent the island has had a stirring history. In the reign\r\nof Henry II it was held by the turbulent family of the Montmorencies or\r\nMoriscos, and the shell of Morisco Castle, now converted into cottages,\r\nstill stands on the south-east corner of the island. During the Civil\r\nWar it was fortified for the king, and only surrendered in 1647. At\r\nvarious times in the seventeenth century it was captured by French,\r\nSpaniards, and Algerines; and it was, moreover, several times occupied\r\nby pirates, some of whom were Englishmen, who found it a convenient\r\nstation from which to plunder ships sailing up the Bristol Channel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Watershed. Rivers and the tracing of their courses. Lakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDevonshire is a well-watered county, a county of many rivers; and\r\nalthough not one of its multitudinous streams is of real commercial\r\nimportance or of much value as a water-way, by their mere abundance and\r\nby the beauty of their scenery, especially of the magnificent ravines\r\nwhich many of them in the lapse of ages have worn deep in the rock, they\r\nform one of its most striking features.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important watershed is the great upland of Dartmoor,\r\nwhere, with few exceptions, rise all the principal rivers. The\r\nheadwaters of the Tamar and the Torridge--which rise close together,\r\nbut flow in very different directions and reach different seas--are in\r\nthe high ground in the north-west, on the very border of Cornwall, and\r\nthe sources of the Exe and of its great twin stream the Barle are on\r\nthe moor to which the former gives its name, just inside the county of\r\nSomerset. But the tributaries of all these are drawn from the bogs of\r\nDartmoor, and especially from the morasses round the now insignificant\r\nsheet of water known as Cranmere Pool. The whole eastern border of the\r\ncounty, from Exmoor southward to the Blackdown Hills, is a source of\r\nstreams. Such are the Lyn, flowing into the Bristol Channel; the Bray,\r\nthe Yeo, and the Mole, tributaries of the Taw; the Loman, the Culm, and\r\nthe Clyst, tributaries of the Exe; the Otter, falling into the English\r\nChannel; and the Yarty, a tributary of the Axe. It is remarkable that\r\nof all the many streams of Devonshire, only two of any consequence reach\r\nthe estuary of the Severn. Almost all flow into the English Channel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The River Exe at Tiverton]\r\n\r\nThe longest of the Devonshire rivers is the Exe, after which are\r\nnamed Exford and Exton in Somerset, and Exeter and Exmouth in our own\r\ncounty--a strong and beautiful stream which rises near Simonsbath on\r\nExmoor, flowing for the first twenty miles through Somerset and crossing\r\nthe Devonshire border near Dulverton station, where it is met, on the\r\nleft bank, by its great tributary the Barle. It then runs nearly due\r\nsouth, through well-wooded and fertile country, being joined on its\r\nleft bank, at Tiverton, \"the town of the two fords,\" by the Loman; and\r\nfarther down on the same side by the Culm, which gives its name to\r\nCulmstock. Near Exeter it receives on the right bank the Creedy, a\r\npretty and winding stream that lends its name to Crediton, and along\r\nwhose shores in some of the richest land in Devonshire. A little below\r\nExeter, close to the once famous port of Topsham, it is joined on the\r\nleft bank by the Clyst, a small and unimportant stream, flowing through\r\nmost fertile country, and giving its name to no fewer than seven\r\nvillages. Below Topsham the Exe widens out to nearly a mile, forming,\r\nat high tide, from this point to the sea, a noble estuary five miles\r\nlong, with the popular watering-place of Exmouth on the slope of the\r\neastern side of its entrance, which is almost closed by a long sandbank\r\ncalled the Warren, divided into two parts by a stream. Until late in the\r\nthirteenth century the Exe was navigable from the sea to Exeter. But in\r\n1290 Isabella de Fortibus, Countess of Devon, having quarrelled with the\r\ncitizens, blocked the river-bed with stones, at a place still called\r\nthe Countess Weir, leaving, however, sufficient room for ships to pass.\r\nAt a later period this space was closed by the Earl of Devon, and the\r\nnavigation of the river entirely stopped. Vessels now reach Exeter by a\r\ncanal.\r\n\r\nThe second river in point of length is the Tamar, after which are\r\nnamed North Tamerton in Cornwall and Tamerton Foliott in our own\r\ncounty. Rising in the extreme north-west, in the high ground that parts\r\nDevonshire from Cornwall, it forms almost the whole of the dividing line\r\nbetween the two counties, and is characterised throughout the lower\r\nportion of its course by some very beautiful scenery. It is joined by\r\nmany streams, some rising in Devonshire and some in Cornwall; some of\r\nwhich--the Lyd, for example--are renowned for their wildness and beauty.\r\nThe largest of the western tributaries is the Lynher, entirely a Cornish\r\nriver, whose estuary joins the Hamoaze. The most important of those on\r\nthe left bank is the Tavy, a Dartmoor-drawn stream, giving its name to\r\nthe town of Tavistock and to the villages of Peter Tavy and Mary Tavy,\r\nand flowing through some of the most fruitful land in Devonshire. A\r\nparticularly fertile district is that lying between the Tavy and the\r\nTamar.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is a much shorter river than the Exe or the Tamar, the Dart\r\nis better known than either, and is perhaps the most familiar by name\r\nof all the Devonshire streams. Along its banks, especially near Holne\r\nand Buckland-in-the-Moor, and along the wooded shores of its magnificent\r\nestuary, is some of the most beautiful river-scenery, not in this county\r\nonly but in all England. The most important of its many tributaries are\r\nthe East and the West Dart--both of which rise in the great bog round\r\nCranmere Pool, and join at a picturesque spot called Dartmeet--and the\r\nWebburns, East and West. Below Totnes the Dart widens out into a long\r\nand most beautiful estuary, winding among finely-wooded hills. On the\r\nwest side of its entrance is the old port of Dartmouth, named, like\r\nDartington, after the river, and on the opposite shore is the smaller\r\nbut equally picturesque little town of Kingswear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: On the Dart; Sharpham Woods]\r\n\r\nFamous as the Dart is for the wildness and beauty of its scenery, and\r\nfor the excellence of its trout and salmon fishing, it has an evil name\r\nfor the dangerous nature of its swiftly-flowing waters, which, after\r\nheavy rain on the moor, rise with extraordinary rapidity, changing it\r\nin a few hours from a peaceful and easily-forded stream into a raging\r\nand resistless torrent. At Hexworthy, in November, 1894, the river rose\r\nten and a half feet above the level of the previous day. Characteristic\r\nof this as the other of the moorland streams, is the strange sound it\r\nsometimes makes, especially towards nightfall, known as its \"cry,\" and\r\nbelieved by the superstitious to be ominous of flood and danger. To\r\n\"hear the Broadstones crying\"--masses of granite lying in the bed of the\r\nstream--is considered by the moor-folk a sure sign of coming rain.\r\n\r\nThe Dartmoor rivers, in the upper part of their courses, are naturally\r\nall swift, and are all more or less tinged by the peat of their\r\nmoorland birth-place--lightly, when the stream is low, and deepening in\r\nflood-time into the colour of a rich cairngorm.\r\n\r\nThe Teign, another of the streams that rise in the Cranmere bog, is\r\nfamous both for the beauty of the scenery along its winding shores and\r\nfor the many prehistoric antiquities--stone circles and alignments,\r\nmenhirs and tumuli--which stand near them. Its two main branches, the\r\nNorth and the South Teign, meet about a mile to the west of Chagford. To\r\nthe east of that moorland village the river flows through beautifully\r\nwooded valleys, and is joined on its right bank, below Chudleigh, by\r\nanother Dartmoor tributary, the Bovey, on which stand Bovey Tracy,\r\nfamous for its beds of lignite and clay and for its potteries, and North\r\nBovey, near which are the remains of the very remarkable Bronze Age\r\nvillage of Grimspound. Below Newton Abbot the Teign becomes a broad\r\nestuary, on or near whose shores are five of the townships that are\r\nnamed after the river, the most important of which is the little port\r\nand well-known watering-place of Teignmouth. The river mouth is almost\r\nblocked by a low promontory, which, although now built over, was once a\r\nmere sand-bank or dune, from which latter word, no doubt, it takes its\r\nname of the Den.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Axe at Axminster Bridge]\r\n\r\nOther south-coast rivers are the Axe--one of whose two main branches\r\nrises in Somerset and the other in Dorset--which gives its name to\r\nAxminster and Axmouth; the Otter, which rises in the Blackdown\r\nHills, and flowing past Honiton, Ottery St Mary, and Otterton, reaches\r\nthe sea at Budleigh Salterton; the Aune or Avon, especially famous\r\nfor its salmon, the Erme, and the slopes Yealm, small but beautiful\r\nstreams rising on the southern slopes of Dartmoor, widening into estuaries\r\nas they near the English Channel, and giving names to Aveton, Ermington,\r\nand Yealmpton, respectively. The Plym, after which are named Plympton,\r\nPlymouth, and Plymstock, is another Dartmoor river, flowing through some\r\nvery beautiful country, especially in the neighbourhood of Bickleigh,\r\nand at length forming a broad and important estuary known first as\r\nthe Laira, and lower down as the Catwater or Cattewater, which joins\r\nPlymouth Sound.\r\n\r\nThe chief rivers on the north coast are the Torridge and the Taw, the\r\nformer of which, rising in the extreme north-west, on the Cornish\r\nborder, near the source of the Tamar, flows south-west for nearly half\r\nits course, and then sweeps round to run in the opposite direction,\r\ngiving its name to three several Torringtons, and having as its chief\r\ntributaries the Walden, the Lew, and the Okement, all on its right bank.\r\nThe last-named stream is formed of the East and the West Okements, which\r\nmeet at Okehampton, their namesake. The lower waters of the Torridge\r\nform a long and narrow estuary--its shore only ten miles distant from\r\nthe original source of the river--half-way down which is the once\r\nimportant port of Bideford, built on both sides of the stream, which\r\nis here spanned by a very ancient bridge. Near the entrance of the\r\nestuary, but neither of them on the open sea, are Appledore, the port of\r\nBarnstaple, and Instow, a small but growing watering-place.\r\n\r\nThe Taw is a Dartmoor-drawn river, rising, like so many streams, in the\r\nCranmere bog, giving its name to Tawstock and to three several Tawtons,\r\nand receiving on its right bank the Yeo, the Little Dart, and the Mole.\r\nThe most considerable town on it is Barnstaple, beyond which it becomes\r\na broad tidal estuary, joining that of the Torridge, and flowing out\r\ninto what is known both as Barnstaple and Bideford Bay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bideford and the Torridge Estuary]\r\n\r\nMany small streams fall into the Bristol Channel, among which is the\r\nLyn, renowned for its beautiful scenery and its good trout-fishing.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of the Celtic words in our language are found in\r\nthe names of natural features, especially of hills and rivers. This is\r\nparticularly well seen in Devonshire, where, as has been pointed out,\r\nthe Saxons came as settlers rather than conquerors, adopting many of\r\nthe names which they found already in use, and where an unusually large\r\nnumber of towns and villages have been called after the streams on which\r\nthey stand.\r\n\r\nThe names Exe, Axe, and Okement, from the Celtic _uisge_; Avon, Aune,\r\nand Auney, from _afon_; Dart, from _dwr_; and Teign, from _tain_, are\r\nall derived from roots meaning \"water.\" Other names are taken from\r\ndescriptive adjectives, such as Wrey, from _rea_, rapid; Lyn, from\r\n_lleven_, smooth; and Tamar, Taw, and Tavy, from _tam_, spreading or\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nThe lakes of Devonshire, as is the case in the majority of English\r\ncounties, are little more than ponds. Cranmere Pool, in the great morass\r\nwhere many Devonshire rivers rise, lying in a dreary spot, as befits\r\nthe reputed place of punishment of evil spirits, has shrunk of late\r\nyears in consequence of much peat-cutting in its neighbourhood, and\r\nis now an insignificant pond, rarely more than seventy yards across,\r\nand in hot summers sometimes quite dry. Bradmere Pool and Classenwell\r\nPool, the sites of old mine-workings, are beautiful little lakes, but\r\nthey are only a few acres in extent. Burrator Reservoir has been made\r\nin order to supply water to Plymouth. The largest of these miniature\r\nlakes is Slapton Ley, or Lea, a long and narrow sheet of water, two and\r\na quarter miles in length and measuring about 200 acres, separated from\r\nthe sea, with which it was no doubt once connected, by a bank of fine\r\nshingle. The reeds of its north-eastern end, which are cut and sold for\r\nthatching, are the haunt of many water-birds; and the Ley is visited in\r\nwinter by immense numbers of migratory ducks and waders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Geology.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree main points characterise the geological features of Devonshire;\r\nthe simplicity of the system in the west, north-centre and south-west of\r\nthe county; the comparative complexity and variety of the strata in the\r\neast and south; and, most remarkable of all, the extraordinary number of\r\noutcrops of igneous rock, from the great mass of Dartmoor granite, which\r\nhas no parallel in England, to the hundreds of small dykes or elvans\r\nthat are scattered chiefly over the southern region, although some occur\r\nto the north and east of Dartmoor.\r\n\r\nThe oldest rocks in Devonshire are probably not, as was once thought,\r\nthe granites, but the highly altered or metamorphic formations in the\r\nextreme south; that is to say, the mica and quartz schists and the\r\nhornblende epidote schists which extend from near Start Point to Bolt\r\nTail, a district which, owing in great measure to distortion by volcanic\r\nupheaval, includes some of the most picturesque scenery in Devon.\r\n\r\nNext in order of age is the series called Devonian, after the name of\r\nthe county, in which they were first distinguished from the Old Red\r\nSandstone. They are, however, by no means confined to Devonshire, but\r\nare very widely distributed, covering a large part of Cornwall, and\r\noccurring on the continent of Europe, especially in Russia, and in Asia\r\nand North and South America. The Devonian beds--which are found both in\r\nthe north and south, occupying two distinct areas separated by widespread\r\ndeposits of culm or carboniferous measures--were, it is thought,\r\nformed in open water, and probably at the same time that the Old Red\r\nSandstone of the adjoining county of Somerset and elsewhere, which is\r\nnot found in this county at all, was being deposited in estuaries and\r\nland-locked seas.\r\n\r\n         NAMES OF           SUBDIVISIONS                    CHARACTERS OF ROCKS\r\n         SYSTEMS\r\n\r\n                       {Metal Age Deposits

Rocks\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM SECTION FROM SNOWDON TO HARWICH, ABOUT 200 MILES.\r\n\r\nThis cross section shows what would be seen in a deep cutting nearly E.\r\nand W. across England and Wales. It shows also how, in consequence of\r\nthe folding of the strata and the cutting off of the uplifted parts,\r\nold rocks which should be tens of thousands of feet down are found in\r\nborings in East Anglia only 1000 feet or so below the surface.]\r\n\r\nThe North Devonian beds, which extend from the coast as far south as\r\nthe latitude of Barnstaple, consist of slates, grits, and sandstones\r\nwhich, it is believed, judging from the organic remains in them,\r\nwere formed in shallow water and near shore. Their lower strata, the\r\nForeland grits, Lynton beds, and Hangman grits, contain some fossils\r\nand various kinds of coral. But the Middle beds, the Ilfracombe and\r\nMorte slates, are much richer in animal remains; of which perhaps the\r\nmost remarkable are primitive palaeozoic fish, such as the very curious\r\narmoured _pteraspis_; while corals and bivalve shells are abundant and\r\ncharacteristic. The Upper Devonian is less fossiliferous, but contains\r\nsome large trilobites, various marine shells, and some land-plants.\r\n\r\nThe South Devonian, which covers nearly all South Devon and a large part\r\nof Cornwall, is somewhat different in character, consisting chiefly\r\nof slates, with coralline limestones, varied by volcanic outcrops or\r\nelvans--a word said to be of Cornish origin, and meaning \"white rock.\"\r\nTo judge from its fossils, it was deposited in deeper water than the\r\ncontemporary beds in the north of the county. The Lower and Middle\r\nbeds are also far richer in animal remains; and the Middle Devonian of\r\nthe south, which is the most typical of the series and includes the\r\nlimestones of Plymouth and Torbay, is crowded with shells, trilobites,\r\nand corals. Among the shells, bivalves--such as _Stringocephalus_, which\r\noccurs only in the Devonian formations--spiral univalves, and corals\r\nare very abundant. There are also many crinoids, distinct from those\r\nof the carboniferous limestone, while perhaps the most characteristic\r\nform is the rare and curious _Caleola sandalina_, differing from all\r\nother corals in having an operculum. There are not many varieties of\r\ntrilobite, but the large _Brontes flabellifer_ is not uncommon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Logan Stone, Dartmoor]\r\n\r\nThe Lower beds of this series contain fewer organic remains, although a\r\ngood many fossils are found, including fragmentary remains of various\r\nfishes which have not yet been identified. The Upper Devonian is, on\r\nthe whole, very poor in fossils.\r\n\r\nBetween the two Devonian areas, and occupying a large part of the\r\ncentre of the county, are the carboniferous or coal-bearing measures,\r\ncontaining, however, not true coal but anthracite, which has more carbon\r\nin it than is found in ordinary coal; and these beds are perhaps more\r\noften known as Culm, from the Welsh _cwlwm_, a knot, in allusion to\r\nthe fragmentary condition in which the mineral is frequently found.\r\nAnthracite, which elsewhere and especially in South Wales is a most\r\nvaluable fuel, is here clayey and impure, and in thin seams. It is\r\nworked to a small extent, to be ground and made into a paint called\r\nBideford Black. The Culm measures consist of grits, shales, and\r\nsandstones, with beds of chert and limestone containing fossil plants\r\nand other forms of marine life. Fish are few, only two species having\r\nbeen identified. The anthracite occurs in the middle Culm, and there are\r\nother remains of plants in both the middle and upper beds. The upper\r\nCulm is well seen on the coast near Clovelly and by the river Torridge,\r\nwhere it has been bent by volcanic upheaval into curious and beautiful\r\ncurves. These measures, in general, are characterised by many outcrops\r\nof volcanic rock, some of which were probably contemporary, that is to\r\nsay, they were poured out while the culm was in process of formation;\r\nwhile others are intrusive, or were forced up through the strata after\r\nthese had been solidified into rock. These igneous rocks are found in\r\ngreat variety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A smoothly-weathered granite Tor, Dartmoor]\r\n\r\nBy far the most important and striking of these volcanic formations\r\nis the great granite mass of Dartmoor, one of the most prominent\r\nfeatures of the county, measuring 225 square miles in extent, and\r\nconstituting the largest granitic area in England. Granite is a volcanic\r\nrock, formed, it has been suggested, by fusion at a great depth and\r\nunder great pressure, and consisting in the main of three minerals,\r\nquartz, felspar, and mica. That of Dartmoor is, on the whole, grey and\r\ncoarse-grained, but it varies a good deal in colour, fineness, and\r\ncomposition. Its real origin is obscure. It has been assigned by various\r\nexperts to various periods, and it has been called \"the sphinx of Devon\r\ngeology.\" There can, however, be no doubt about the great disturbance\r\nwhich has been caused in the county by upheaval and by the intrusion of\r\nmelted rock, which has bent, broken, and twisted previously-existing\r\nformations in a most extraordinary manner, the results of which are well\r\nseen in the picturesque scenery of the Start, Prawle Point, and Bolt\r\nHead. Lundy, which is twelve miles from the nearest point of Devonshire\r\nmainland, is all granite, except for a small part of its south end,\r\nwhich is Millstone Grit.\r\n\r\nA long interval of time appears to have followed the laying down of\r\nthe Culm measures, during which so vast an amount of shattered rock\r\nwas worn away that when the beds that come next in order--the New Red\r\nSandstones--were formed, they were, in places, deposited directly upon\r\nthe Devonian, the superincumbent carboniferous or Culm strata having\r\nentirely disappeared. The New Red Sandstones occur chiefly in the east\r\nof the county, where their lower beds fill up old creeks and valleys\r\nin the carboniferous system; and they extend northwards from the coast\r\npast Exeter as far as Holcombe Regis, forming broad bands on either\r\nside of the Exe, characterised by the high fertility of the overlying\r\nsoil, and with one long spur traversing the heart of the county, past\r\nCrediton and Exbourne, with isolated patches round Hatherleigh, and with\r\nanother and less extended prolongation a few miles west of Tiverton.\r\nThe Lower New Red consists of clays, conglomerates, red breccias and\r\nsands, in which occur many outcrops of trap, the evidence, not only of\r\nnumerous eruptions, but of eruptions extending over a long period of\r\ntime. These beds contain no fossils, except in fragments of older rocks.\r\nThe Middle New Red, in the form of thick beds of red marl and red and\r\nwhite limestones, well seen on the south coast, is covered in turn\r\nby the Upper New Red, with beds of pebbles, some of which are derived\r\nfrom the Devonian and even from the Silurian. In this formation, near\r\nSidmouth, have been found the remains of two remarkable reptiles, the\r\n_Hyperodapedon_, a strange form allied to the existing tuatera lizard\r\nof New Zealand and in England only known elsewhere in the formations\r\nof Warwickshire, and the _Labyrinthodon_, so named from the intricate\r\nstructure of its teeth, and also called _Cheirotherium_, from the\r\nhand-like impressions of its feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Footprints of _Cheirotherium_, New Red Sandstone]\r\n\r\nThe Rhaetic beds are not well seen in Devonshire. They occur on the\r\ncoast between Lyme Regis and the mouth of the Axe, and in the estuary of\r\nthat river, but are much hidden by landslips of cretaceous formations\r\nfrom above. One layer, consisting of black shale, with bivalve shells\r\nsuch as _Cardium_ and _Pecten_, contains also a bone-bed, with remains\r\nof fish, such as _Acrodus_ and _Hybodus_. The former is represented by\r\nits blunt teeth, and the latter, which was a huge, shark-like creature,\r\nby its long and formidable-looking fin-spines.\r\n\r\nThe Lower Lias is exposed in a narrow strip of coast from the Devonshire\r\nborder to the mouth of the Axe, and to a greater extent in the valley of\r\nthe river above Axminster. It has been divided on the coast into four\r\ndistinct zones, each characterised by its own particular species of\r\nammonite.\r\n\r\nThe cretaceous formations occupy a much wider area, but they also\r\nare confined to the southern part of the county. The Greensands of\r\nthe Blackdown and Haldon Hills have been divided by geologists into\r\nfifteen layers, varying in thickness from a few inches to as much as\r\nthirty-five feet, some with few fossils, and some very rich in animal\r\nremains. _Trigonia_ and _Inoceramus_ are found in almost all the zones:\r\nother forms less widely distributed are _Murex_ and _Turritella_. Chalk\r\noccurs on the south coast from the Dorset border to Sidmouth; and in\r\nisolated patches it extends inland as far as the Blackdown Hills, and\r\nalso further west, in the Haldons. The Lower Chalk, well seen on the\r\ncoast and to the west of Hinton, is made up of calcareous sandstones,\r\nwith ammonites and pectens. The Middle beds, composed of white chalk\r\nwith flints, the zone of _Terebratulina gracilis_, is exposed at Beer.\r\nThe lower and harder layer is characterised by _Rhynconella_. The Upper\r\nChalk also holds many flints, with echini; _Holaster_ in the lower, and\r\n_Micraster_ in the upper strata.\r\n\r\nLast of all come the tertiary deposits, which, however, occupy only a\r\nsmall area in the south-east, chiefly in the valley of the Teign, from\r\nKingsteignton to Bovey Tracy; and there are a few isolated patches, as\r\nfor example near Bideford and at Plymouth. These beds consist of clays,\r\nsome of them of much value, with flints from the chalk, and gravels and\r\nbeds of sand derived from the wearing away of older rocks. The most\r\ninteresting feature of this formation is the lignite of Bovey Tracy,\r\non the eastern edge of Dartmoor. Lignite, otherwise known as brown\r\ncoal, consists of the imperfectly fossilised remains of tropical or\r\nsub-tropical vegetation, such as the palm, cinnamon, and laurel, amongst\r\nwhich are found lumps of resin. By far the most abundant remains are\r\nthose of a very large tree allied to the sequoia of California. It is\r\nvery remarkable that in the Pleistocene clay above the lignite are found\r\nstems and twigs of Arctic birch and willow, suggestive of a far colder\r\nclimate than prevailed in Tertiary times, when the trees that went to\r\nform the lignite were growing.\r\n\r\nTo the Pleistocene period also belong the gravels and alluvial deposits\r\nof some of the river valleys (those of the Exe and the Teign, for\r\nexample), the blown sands of Braunton Burrows and elsewhere, the raised\r\nsea-beaches, the submerged forests, and the cave-deposits which are\r\nalluded to in other chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Natural History.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is generally believed by naturalists that the ancestors of most of\r\nour fauna and flora reached this country at a time when what we now call\r\nthe British Isles formed part of the mainland of Europe, and when there\r\nwas no intervening sea to bar the way.\r\n\r\nBefore this colonisation was complete, however--that is, before all the\r\ndifferent kinds of European beasts and birds had made their way to the\r\nextreme western districts--communication with the continent was broken\r\noff. The land of the north-western districts of Europe sank. The sea\r\nflowed in, forming the German Ocean, the English Channel and the Irish\r\nSea, and the influx of animal life was stopped.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why there are more than twice as many kinds of land\r\nanimals in Germany as there are in England, and nearly twice as many in\r\nEngland as there are in Ireland. This is the reason why there are no\r\nsnakes in Ireland, and why the nightingale, on returning from the south,\r\nnever crosses into the sister kingdom.\r\n\r\nOn islands that have long been separated from a continent it is found\r\nthat forms of life tend to vary in the lapse of time, and that fresh\r\nspecies are developed. That it is not long, as geological periods go,\r\nsince Great Britain became an island, is shown by the fact that we have\r\nno quadruped or reptile except the Irish weasel (_Mustela hibernica_),\r\nand, setting aside minor differences which some writers have magnified\r\nto the value of a species, only one bird, the red grouse, which is not\r\nalso to be found in Europe. Very different is the case in Japan, which\r\nwas separated from the mainland of Asia so long ago that new species\r\nhave had time to develope; and the islands of that country contain many\r\nkinds of beasts and birds which are unknown on the adjacent continent.\r\n\r\nSome of the animals which came from Europe into Britain have died out,\r\neither because the climate changed and so cut off their food supply, or\r\nbecause they were destroyed by the hunters of the Stone Age. The bones\r\nwhich have been found in Kent's Cavern at Torquay, and in other caverns,\r\nafford clear evidence that the mammoth, the lion, the bear, and the\r\nhyaena once roamed over the hills of Devonshire.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are many more species of beasts and birds on the\r\ncontinent of Europe than there are in this country, both birds and\r\nbeasts are numerically much more common here. Nothing strikes a\r\nnaturalist more forcibly when travelling in France or Italy, for\r\nexample, than the scarcity of wild life, and especially the fewness\r\nof the birds. It is true that we have fewer species, but we have many\r\nmore individuals. To this, several causes have contributed. Englishmen\r\ndo not, as is the custom in many European countries, shoot or trap for\r\nfood small birds of every description. And game preserving--although\r\nit has been fatal to the larger birds of prey, such as kites, falcons,\r\nand buzzards, and keeps down other species, such as jays, magpies, and\r\ncarrion crows--provides innumerable sanctuaries for great numbers of the\r\nsmaller birds, which are safe from harm during the breeding season.\r\n\r\nThe natural features of Devonshire are so varied in character, including\r\nas they do large areas of wild and uncultivated and thinly-inhabited\r\ncountry, together with many well-wooded and sequestered valleys, and\r\nwide stretches of bog, salt-marsh, and sea-coast, that it is very\r\nrich in both animal and vegetable life. Its marine fauna and flora,\r\nin particular, are of very great interest, and are among the most\r\nremarkable in England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Red Deer]\r\n\r\nNearly all the native mammals of the British Isles are found or have\r\nbeen found in this county, from the \"tall red deer\" that has run wild on\r\nExmoor from time immemorial, down to the pygmy shrew, the smallest but\r\none of European quadrupeds, and weighing only one-tenth of an ounce, or\r\nabout forty-three grains and a half.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Otters]\r\n\r\nAmong the eight species of Devonshire bats is the very rare\r\nparticoloured bat (_Vesperugo discolor_), of which the only example\r\never recorded in England was taken at Plymouth, having perhaps\r\ntravelled there in the rigging of a ship. It is probably more than a\r\nhundred years since the last genuine wild-cat was seen in the county,\r\nbut both the marten and the polecat still survive in secluded spots.\r\nFoxes are common, and there are still many badgers in some of the\r\nDartmoor valleys, where the two species have been known to inhabit\r\nthe same holt. Otters abound on all the principal streams, and are as\r\nregularly hunted as the red deer and the fox. Devonshire is,\r\nindeed, pre-eminent for its otter-hunting, and the Culmstock pack\r\nis believed to be the oldest in the island. Harvest mice and dormice,\r\nalthough widely distributed, are not numerous, and the original English\r\nblack rat is now rare.\r\n\r\nAmong the many marine mammalia that have been recorded for the county\r\nare two kinds of seal, the sperm-whale, the common rorqual--of which\r\nspecimens nearly 70 feet long have been brought into Plymouth--the rare\r\nbottle-nosed dolphin and the still rarer Risso's grampus. Bones of a\r\nwhale called _Balaenoptera robustus_, which were once washed ashore in\r\nTorbay, are said to represent a species so rare that these and a few\r\nsimilar relics stranded in Sweden are the only remains of it that have\r\never been found.\r\n\r\nSituated as Devonshire is, between the English and the Bristol Channels,\r\nand containing widely-different physical features, suited to the needs\r\nof species of very different habits, the list of its birds, including\r\nresidents, migrants, occasional visitors, and stragglers from the\r\nAtlantic and even from America, is a very long one.\r\n\r\nAmong the larger land-birds which still hold their ground in the county\r\nare the raven and buzzard, both of which are to be seen on Exmoor and\r\nDartmoor and on the coast, and the peregrine falcon, which has eyries\r\non both the northern and southern seaboards. A few pairs of choughs\r\nstill build in the northern cliffs; while such rare birds as Montagu's\r\nharrier--first identified as a British species in this county--the\r\nhoopoe, and the golden oriole still occasionally breed here, and might\r\ndo so regularly were they left in peace. Several birds, such as the\r\nkite and the osprey, the latter of which now breeds nowhere in England,\r\nand the former only in one solitary spot, have long since left the\r\ncounty. Warblers as a family are less abundant than in some other parts\r\nof the British Isles. The nightingale is nowhere common, but it occurs\r\nevery season near Ashburton and in the valley of the Teign. Owing to\r\nthe mildness of the climate it is not at all an unusual thing for a few\r\nchiffchaffs and willow-warblers to spend the winter in sheltered valleys\r\non the south coast, instead of migrating to Africa in the autumn. The\r\nring-ouzel is a regular visitor to the open country of Dartmoor, while\r\nthe dipper haunts many of its streams. Two birds which have greatly\r\nincreased in numbers of late years are the jackdaw and the starling.\r\nIt is thought that the former has done much towards exterminating the\r\nchough by destroying its eggs; and the latter, by taking possession\r\nof its holes, has in many places driven away the green woodpecker.\r\nPartridges and pheasants are numerous, but black-game, once abundant on\r\nDartmoor, have become so scarce that they are at present protected the\r\nwhole year round.\r\n\r\nBut by far the most abundant, and perhaps the most characteristic,\r\nof the birds of Devonshire are the sea-fowl, the water-fowl, and the\r\nwaders, of which more than 140 different kinds have been recorded for\r\nthe county. Not only are its sandy shores, its bays and estuaries\r\nand leys, haunted in autumn and winter by multitudes of northern\r\nimmigrants--swans, geese, ducks and a great variety of wading-birds; but\r\nthere are several spots along the south coast and a few on the north\r\nwhere sea-birds regularly breed; while the reed-beds of Slapton Ley\r\nprovide sanctuary for great numbers of coots and for many wild-ducks\r\nand teal, together with some rarer species. Herons are common on the\r\nsouth coast and along the river estuaries, and there are heronries at\r\nPowderham and elsewhere. A great black-headed gull (_Larus ichthyaetus_)\r\nshot on the Exe in 1859, is the only one known to have been seen in the\r\nBritish Islands.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, nothing on the mainland of Devonshire to compare\r\nin ornithological interest with Lundy, which in the summer time is\r\na bird-lover's paradise. Gannets, once very numerous, have now left\r\nthe island, but cormorants, shags and gulls of various species here\r\nbuild their untidy nests. Here multitudes of guillemots and razorbills\r\nassemble in the spring and lay their great pear-shaped and boldly-marked\r\neggs on the ledges of the cliffs; while even vaster hosts of puffins\r\ncome back every year to take up their quarters in rabbit-burrows or in\r\nholes which they have dug for themselves in the turf. Here the raven,\r\nthe buzzard, and the peregrine have fastnesses. Here, in chinks and\r\ncrannies, storm-petrels breed; and here, when darkness falls, the\r\nstartled listener may hear the weird, wailing cry of the night-wandering\r\nshearwaters.\r\n\r\nThe few reptiles and batrachians of Devonshire present no points of\r\nspecial interest. Vipers abound on Dartmoor, where they are commoner\r\nthan grass-snakes. It is curious that, while the palmated newt is\r\ncommon throughout the county, the smooth newt and the triton are now\r\ncomparatively rare.\r\n\r\nThe freshwater fish differ little from those found in the neighbouring\r\ncounties; but there are fewer kinds in Devonshire than there are in the\r\nmidlands or in the east of England. Trout abound in all the streams, and\r\nthere are important salmon-fisheries on the Exe, the Dart, and other\r\nrivers. A sturgeon seven-and-a-half feet long was once taken in the\r\nExe. Eels, which are hatched in the Atlantic, to the west and north of\r\nthe British Islands, at a depth of 3000 feet or more, come up from the\r\nsea when they are two years old, and still very small, and ascend the\r\nrivers, especially Exe, in enormous numbers. When they are mature, which\r\nis not until they are several years old, they go down to the sea to\r\nspawn, and never return.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, in marine zoology, for which few other parts of\r\nEngland afford so rich a field, and for which its bays and inlets,\r\nits rock-pools and stretches of sand provide ideal hunting-ground for\r\nthe naturalist, that Devonshire is most distinguished. Many famous\r\nzoologists, such as Leach, Montagu, Parfitt, Gosse, and Kingsley have\r\nwon renown both for themselves and for the county by their researches;\r\nwhile the Marine Biological Laboratory at Plymouth is constantly adding\r\nto our knowledge of the multitudinous inhabitants of the sea. The\r\nsubject is so vast that only a few chief points can here be touched upon.\r\n\r\nThe sea-fish differ in marked degree from those of the east coast\r\nof England. Plaice and cod, for example, are smaller here than those\r\ncaught in the North Sea and the latter are scarce; and the haddock, one\r\nof the most important of east coast fish, is here almost unknown. Two\r\ncharacteristic fish of the south coast of Devon are the pollack, which\r\nreaches a great size, and the pilchard, confined to this county and to\r\nCornwall. Many southern and even Mediterranean species find their way to\r\nthese waters: notable examples are the gigantic tunny, one specimen of\r\nwhich weighed 700 pounds, the beautiful rainbow wrasse, one of the most\r\nbrilliantly-coloured of all fish, and the boar-fish, which is sometimes\r\nquite common. A number of rare species, such as Montagu's sucker and\r\nthe crystal goby, were first made known as British through being taken\r\noff the Devonshire coast. Stray examples of the tropical bonito, the\r\nflying-fish, the electric torpedo, and the sun-fish, one specimen of\r\nwhich weighed 500 pounds, and the splendidly-coloured opal or king-fish,\r\nhave been recorded. Several kinds of sharks have been caught in these\r\nwaters, including the blue shark, the spinous shark, covered all over\r\nwith sharp prickles, the rare and formidable hammer-head, the huge\r\nthresher, and the still larger basking-shark. The latter is, indeed, the\r\nlargest of British fish. Specimens have been caught measuring 30 feet in\r\nlength, and weighing more than eight tons. Marketable marine-fish will\r\nbe treated of in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nRich as are the Devonshire seas in fish, they are richer still in\r\ncrustaceans--crabs, lobsters, prawns, shrimps and their allies; and in\r\nthis respect ours is the premier county of England. Among a multitude\r\nof species, two which have occurred nowhere else in Britain may be\r\nspecially singled out. One of these is the burying-shrimp, _Callionassa\r\nsubterranea_, a little creature something like a very small lobster,\r\nwith one claw--sometimes the right and sometimes the left--very much\r\nlarger than the other. It was one of Montagu's many discoveries, and was\r\nfound two feet deep under the sand of the Kingsbridge estuary. The other\r\nrare species is the turtle-crab, _Planes minutus_, a few specimens of\r\nwhich have been drifted ashore on fronds of Sargasso weed. The \"small\r\ngrasshoppers\" which Columbus saw floating in the sea a few days before\r\nhe sighted the New World, were, it is believed, not grasshoppers, but\r\nturtle-crabs.\r\n\r\nOther and very beautiful forms of marine life, such as starfish,\r\nanemones, corals and other zoophytes, and sea-shells are very abundant.\r\nAnd in spite of the comparative scarcity of lime in the soil of\r\nDevonshire, the list of land and freshwater shells is a long one. It\r\nis remarkable that _Limnaea stagnalis_ and _Planorbis corneus_, two\r\nwater-shells that are common in Somerset, are unknown in Devon. The\r\npearl-bearing mussel, _Unio margaritifer_, is found in both the Taw and\r\nthe Teign.\r\n\r\nThe county is rich in insects, especially as regards butterflies, moths,\r\nand beetles; but several of the first-named which have been caught in\r\nSomerset have not been recorded here. The black-veined white (_Pieris\r\ncrataegi_), once a common insect, has disappeared within the last forty\r\nyears, and the greasy fritillary (_Melitaea Artemis_)--another vanishing\r\nspecies--is now almost extinct. Neither insect can have been hunted\r\ndown for the sake of its beauty or its rarity, and the reason for this\r\ndisappearance is unknown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spurge Hawk Moth, with Pupa and Caterpillar]\r\n\r\nAs in the case of birds, the county is, from its position, a favourite\r\nalighting-place for insects coming from abroad. Between 1876 and 1890\r\nlarge numbers of a very striking and beautiful American butterfly,\r\n_Danais plexippus_, appeared in England, having apparently crossed the\r\nAtlantic, and three specimens were caught in Devonshire. The Lulworth\r\nskipper (_Hesperia Actaeon_), a small butterfly which elsewhere is only\r\nfound in Dorset, occurs along the south-east coast of this county. Moths\r\nare very abundant, and the first recorded British examples of several\r\nspecies were taken in Devonshire.\r\n\r\nAbout a hundred years ago, caterpillars of the spurge hawk-moth\r\n(_Deilephila euphorbiae_) were very plentiful on spurge plants growing\r\namong the sand-hills near Barnstaple. Many of these caterpillars were\r\ntaken by naturalists, and were reared, and ultimately turned into\r\nperfect insects; although neither there nor anywhere else in our\r\nisland was a wild example of this very beautiful moth ever seen alive.\r\nThe spurge plants were long ago covered up by drifting sand, and the\r\ncaterpillars were all destroyed. No other locality for them has been\r\nfound in England, and as far as this country is concerned the spurge\r\nhawk-moth appears to be extinct.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected in a district of such varied physical features,\r\nwith so mild a climate and such an ample rainfall, the flowering plants\r\nof Devonshire are very numerous, no fewer than 1156 species having\r\nbeen recorded. The abundance and beauty of its wild-flowers is one\r\nof the characteristics of the county. No one who has ever seen them\r\nwill forget the wonderful wealth of primroses in some of the river\r\nvalleys--at Holne, for example--or the splendour of the ling-empurpled\r\nsweeps of Dartmoor, or its sheets of golden gorse; or the marvellous\r\nmist of bluebells upon woodland slopes or in the shelter of straggling\r\nhedgerows. Each several district, sea-shore and salt-marsh, moor and\r\nbog, wood and valley, has its own distinct and characteristic flora.\r\nOne Devonshire plant, the Romulea or gênotte, _Romulea columnae_, a\r\nMediterranean species with very small pale blue flowers, is abundant on\r\nthe Warren at the mouth of the Exe, but grows nowhere else in England,\r\nalthough it is found in Guernsey. Several plants occur in only one\r\nother English county; such for instance are the white rock-rose,\r\n_Helianthemum polifolium_, and the Irish spurge, _Euphorbia hibernica_,\r\nwhich are confined to Devon and Somerset, and the \"flower of the Exe,\"\r\n_Lobelia urens_, which grows only in Devon and Cornwall. Three plants,\r\nwhich are very abundant in Somerset, the cowslip, the sweet violet, and\r\nthe mistletoe, are rare in this county, although not unknown. The first\r\nplants of sea-kale ever brought into cultivation were originally dug up\r\non Slapton sands; and the vegetable came into note in Bath about 1775.\r\n\r\nFerns are characteristic of Devonshire. Not only are most of the\r\nfamiliar kinds abundant, but rarer species as the true maiden-hair,\r\ntwo filmy ferns, and the parsley fern (_Cryptogramme crispa_) are to\r\nbe found. The magnificent royal fern, _Osmunda regalis_, still grows\r\nin some of the river valleys, and especially in Holne Chase, but it\r\nhas suffered much from the greed of collectors, and the raids of\r\nunscrupulous dealers. A great variety of spleenworts has been recorded\r\nfor the county, and one of the characteristic hedgerow ferns is the\r\npretty little _Asplenium adiantum-nigrum_. Mosses, also, are very\r\nabundant, and there is one kind which occurs nowhere else in Britain.\r\nIn sea-weeds Devonshire is richer than any other county except Dorset.\r\nAmong its 468 different species is the Sargasso or Gulf-weed, sprays of\r\nwhich are sometimes thrown ashore after rough weather.\r\n\r\nExcept on the moors Devonshire is well timbered. The elm is perhaps\r\nthe most conspicuous tree, but the beech and the ash are also very\r\nabundant. There is a very fine wych-elm, with a trunk 16 ft. in\r\ncircumference, in Sharpham Park. The sycamore, which when well-developed\r\nis a very beautiful tree, here attains to fine proportions, and there\r\nare noble examples at Widecombe-in-the-Moor. The oak, although it grows\r\nfreely, does not, as a rule, reach a great size, though there are some\r\nwell-grown specimens at Tawstock Court. There is an oak at Flitton, near\r\nNorth Molton, which is thirty-three feet in circumference, and the Meavy\r\noak is twenty-five feet in girth. An oak-tree thirteen and a half feet\r\nin diameter was cut down at Okehampton in 1776, and there is a tradition\r\nthat two couples danced upon its stump. There are no very remarkable\r\nyews in Devonshire. Probably the finest are at Stoke Gabriel, Kenn,\r\nand Withycombe Raleigh, but the first of these is only fifteen feet\r\nin girth at the level of the ground. There is a story that, under the\r\nyew-tree at Mamhead, Boswell vowed that he would never get drunk\r\nagain. At Bowringsleigh there is a magnificent avenue of lime-trees,\r\nand the avenue of araucarias at Bicton, planted in 1842, is said to be\r\nthe finest in the kingdom. Several manor-houses possess one or more\r\nnoble old mulberry-trees planted in the time of James I, with a view to\r\nencourage the cultivation of silk. At Buckland Abbey, once the home of\r\nSir Francis Drake, there are some beautiful tulip-trees. Palms and other\r\nsub-tropical trees grow without protection at several places on the\r\nsouth coast; and at Kingsbridge and other towns pomegranates, oranges,\r\nlemons, and citrons will ripen their fruit in the open air.\r\n\r\nA good many places in Devonshire take their names from trees. Thus\r\nAshburton is named from the ash, Egg Buckland from the oak, Bickleigh\r\nfrom the beech, and Holne from the holly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. A Peregrination of the Coast: 1, The Bristol Channel.\r\n\r\n\r\nDevonshire, like Cornwall and Kent, is remarkable in having both a\r\nnorthern and a southern seaboard; a peculiarity shared by no other\r\nEnglish county. Its two shores present striking points of difference.\r\nThe south coast-line is broken by many estuaries. On the other shore\r\nthere is only one important river mouth. There are, it is true, many\r\nlittle coves and inlets on the Bristol Channel, some of them of great\r\nbeauty; but they make little show upon the map of England, and the stern\r\noutline of the North Devon coast affords no harbour of refuge.\r\n\r\nBoth shores are rock-bound. But while the southern cliffs are, in great\r\nmeasure, of warm-hued and even brightly-coloured stone, those on the\r\nnorth are dark and gloomy; and their tones, although in some places very\r\nbeautiful, are set in quieter key--in grey or brown or even verging upon\r\nblack. Again, the southern shore is fringed at some points with sandy\r\nbeaches; while on the north coast there are no sands at all, except on\r\nthe western side of Bideford Bay.\r\n\r\nAlong the northern seaboard of Devon there runs a series of magnificent\r\ncliffs, in parts heavily wooded, whose dark walls, sloping steeply\r\nto the shore and with projecting bases suggestive of the ram of a\r\nbattleship, are relieved at many points by deep, rocky clefts, known\r\nvariously as combes or mouths; each with its stream, each green with\r\nferns and oak-coppice and thickets of thorn and hazel, and each with its\r\nbutterfly-haunted clumps of tall hemp-agrimony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Castle Rock, Lynton]\r\n\r\nDown such a hollow, the deep and finely-wooded valley of Glenthorne,\r\nruns the border-line that divides Somerset from Devon. Rather more\r\nthan three miles west of it there stands out into the Bristol Channel\r\nthe dark mass of Countisbury Foreland, the most northerly point in\r\nthe county, and one of the highest along its coast, 1100 feet above\r\nsea-level. Four miles beyond the Foreland, at the mouth of a deep and\r\nwell-wooded valley, down which runs the beautiful trout-stream from\r\nwhich it takes its name, is Lynmouth, famous for its scenery, of which\r\ntwo striking features are the Watersmeet on the river, and the Valley of\r\nRocks on the coast. A port and fishing-village up to the close of the\r\neighteenth century, its small tidal harbour is visited now only by a few\r\nsmall coasting vessels. About four miles west of Lynmouth is Heddon's\r\nMouth, a little bay at the foot of towering cliffs, with another\r\ntrout-stream flowing down to the sea through one of the loveliest\r\ncombes in North Devon. Five miles of cliff stretch from Heddon's\r\nMouth to Combe Martin Bay, a little inlet lying in the shelter of two\r\nconspicuous heights, the Great Hangman and the Little Hangman--names\r\nassociated with no tragic story, but derived, like many others round our\r\ncoasts, from the Celtic _maen_, a stone--and with its village, once\r\nfamous for its rich silver-mines, running a mile inland. Two miles of\r\nrock-bound and dangerous coast, swept, especially off Rillage Point, by\r\na strong tide-race, extend from Combe Martin Bay to the ancient port of\r\nIlfracombe, whose mild yet bracing climate and beautiful surroundings\r\nhave made it the most popular seaside resort in North Devon. Its little\r\nland-locked harbour is almost surrounded by lofty hills and rugged\r\ncliffs, whose beauty is greatly heightened by the varied colouring of\r\nthe rock and by the vivid green of the abundant vegetation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Valley of Rocks, Lynton]\r\n\r\nIlfracombe is a place that has played a part in history. In the\r\nfourteenth century it provided six ships towards Edward III's expedition\r\nagainst Calais. It was from this port that Queen Elizabeth sent troops\r\nto Ireland during the rebellion of the Earl of Tyrone. In the Civil War\r\nit was taken alternately by Royalists and Parliamentarians. It was from\r\nIlfracombe that Wade and Ferguson and other Sedgemoor fugitives tried\r\nin vain to escape by sea. And it was here, in 1796, that the French\r\nsquadron which afterwards landed 1000 scoundrels of the _Légion noire_\r\nat Fishguard, on the opposite coast--the last hostile invasion of these\r\nislands--burnt the fishing-smacks lying in the harbour. The French ships\r\nwere in the end taken by Lord Bridport.\r\n\r\nA short distance west of Ilfracombe is Wildersmouth, a beautiful bay,\r\nwith a gravelly beach, famous for its richness in the lower forms of\r\nmarine life, and three miles farther down the coast juts out Bull\r\nPoint, a bold headland guarded by a powerful lighthouse, marking the\r\nnorth-eastern limit of the most dangerous part of the coast, which\r\nhere turns abruptly southward, facing squarely to the open Atlantic. A\r\nlittle farther on is Morte Point, whose name the popular fancy regards,\r\nalthough without foundation, as hinting at the deadly character of its\r\nblack, jagged, sea-swept rocks. The village of Mortehoe, a few hundred\r\nyards inland, was the property in the thirteenth century of the de\r\nTraci family, one of whom was among the murderers of Thomas à Becket.\r\nBut there is no ground for the legend that he was buried here, or for\r\nthe traditions of him that are current in the district. A tiny little\r\ncove on the south side of Morte Point, called Barracane Beach, was once\r\nfamous for its rare and beautiful shells; but it is now so widely known,\r\nand its charm is so completely lost, that it has been said of it that\r\nthere are more collectors than specimens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ilfracombe, from Hillsborough]\r\n\r\nBeyond Morte Point is Morte Bay, most of whose shore lies low, and is\r\nfringed throughout almost its entire length by the broad expanse of\r\nWoollacombe Sands, along whose margin, at heights varying from eight to\r\nfifteen feet above high-water mark, may be traced at intervals a raised\r\nsea-beach. At the southern extremity of Morte Bay is the noble headland\r\nof Baggy Point, a magnificent piece of cliff, haunted by crowds of\r\nsea-birds, and pierced by many caves. The shore of Croyde Bay, beyond\r\nthe Point, is famous for its fertility; and from the crest of Saunton\r\nDown, the last headland before the estuary formed by the waters of the\r\nTaw and the Torridge, is a view which, embracing sea and coast-line,\r\nrich expanses of farm-land, the distant heights of Dartmoor and the\r\nfaint shape of Lundy on the far horizon, is one of the finest in all\r\nDevon. Along the shore to the south of Baggy Point, where Saunton Sands\r\nform the seaward fringe of Braunton Burrows, is another long stretch of\r\nraised sea-beach, from two to fifteen feet above high-water mark. And\r\nin this beach, not far from Saunton, is a large boulder of red granite,\r\na rock unknown in the district, which may have been stranded here by\r\nfloating ice.\r\n\r\nBraunton Burrows is a long, wide tract of sand-hills, some eighteen\r\nsquare miles in area, stretching far inland, and reaching to the estuary\r\nof the Taw and the Torridge, with deep hollows among which, without a\r\ncompass, it is quite possible to get completely lost. It is a place of\r\nmuch interest to the naturalist and the antiquarian. A number of rare\r\nplants are found here, great quantities of primitive flint implements\r\nhave been discovered in the sand, and at low water the remains of a\r\nsubmerged forest are to be seen along the shore.\r\n\r\nThe estuary formed by the combined streams of the Taw and Torridge,\r\nthe former of which is also known as the Barnstaple River, flows into\r\nBarnstaple Bay at the south end of Braunton Burrows. There is no port\r\non the open coast; but just inside the estuary are the quaint old town\r\nof Appledore and the equally ancient village of Instow, on the left and\r\nright banks, respectively, of the river Torridge. In the mouth of the\r\nsame stream, a little to the south of Appledore, is a long flat rock\r\ncalled the Hubblestone; named, according to tradition, after the viking\r\nHubba, who pillaged this coast in the reign of King Alfred, and fell in\r\nbattle at the mouth of the Parrett, in the adjoining county of Somerset.\r\n\r\nBlocking up a great part of the river mouth, and stretching down the\r\ncoast past Westward Ho! a distance of about two miles, is the Pebble\r\nRidge, a remarkable bank of shingle and sea-worn boulders, some of which\r\nare of great size, though the majority are not more than a few inches in\r\ndiameter. The sea has gradually shifted it further and further inland,\r\nand it now covers what was once a long stretch of good pasture-ground.\r\nOn its landward side are the golf-links of Northam Burrows, considered\r\nto be among the finest south of the Tweed.\r\n\r\nWestward Ho! a modern watering-place named in honour of Kingsley's great\r\nromance, is chiefly interesting on account of its submerged forest, in\r\nwhose peat and clay, deeply covered by the sea at high tide, have been\r\nfound, not only the trunks of large oak and fir-trees, and bones of\r\nthe wild boar, stag, horse, and dog, but bones of man, together with\r\ncharcoal, pottery, and implements of flint.\r\n\r\nSix miles south-west of Westward Ho! and in the centre of the curve that\r\nmarks the southern shore of Barnstaple Bay, is the prettily situated\r\nfishing-village of Buck's Mill, with red and wood-crowned cliffs behind\r\nand beyond it, and extending to Clovelly, the famous little\r\ntown that may truly be called one of the most remarkable spots, not in\r\nDevonshire only, but in all England. Crowded in a hollow in the cliff,\r\nwith woods on either side, and with an air of climbing up from its\r\nlittle tidal harbour sheltered by a rough stone pier of the time of\r\nRichard II, it consists of one long, winding, pebble-paved street, too\r\nsteep for wheeled traffic, with quaint and irregularly-built cottages\r\nto left and right, beautiful with creepers and myrtles, fuchsias and\r\ngeraniums. Not only is Clovelly intimately associated with the memory of\r\nCharles Kingsley, whose father was rector here, but it is the original\r\n\"village of Steepways,\" in Dickens and Collins' Christmas story, _A\r\nMessage from the Sea_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cliffs near Clovelly]\r\n\r\nA long stretch of wild and magnificent coast-line extends from Clovelly\r\nto Hartland Point, where the shore again turns southward, and again\r\nfrom Hartland to the county border; a wall of precipitous black cliffs,\r\nrelieved here and there by bands of red schist, and broken at intervals\r\nby green combes such as are characteristic of the seabord of Devon; a\r\nterrible coast, strewn with fragments of wreckage from ill-fated ships.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clovelly Harbour]\r\n\r\nHartland Point, believed to be the Promontory of Hercules alluded to by\r\nthe geographer Ptolemy, is a noble headland, whose dark steeps rise 350\r\nfeet sheer up out of a dangerous and ever restless sea. Perhaps there\r\nis not, in any other part of North Devon, more striking evidence of\r\nvolcanic upheaval and disturbance than is to be seen in the curved and\r\ngnarled and twisted strata of the cliffs that tower above Hartland Quay.\r\n\r\nSix miles south of Hartland the northern seaboard of the county ends, as\r\nit began, in a deep hollow in the cliffs, Marsland Mouth, a beautiful\r\ncombe, down which, under storm-beaten oaks and thickets of thorn and\r\nhazel, there winds the stream that forms the border-line between\r\nDevonshire and Cornwall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Church Rock, Clovelly]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9. A Peregrination of the Coast: 2, The English Channel.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe points that specially characterise the southern seaboard of\r\nDevonshire, and distinguish it from the northern shore, are its many\r\nestuaries, its numerous bays and bold headlands, the strong, deep red,\r\nin some places, of its rugged cliffs, and, in a minor degree, the sandy\r\nbeaches which lend an added charm to many of its seaside towns.\r\n\r\nNo natural feature marks the spot, half-way between Lyme Cobb and\r\nthe Seven Rocks Point, where the border-line between Dorsetshire and\r\nDevonshire begins. But all that part of the coast, almost as far as the\r\nmouth of the Axe, shows signs of having been broken away by repeated\r\nlandslips; one of the most serious of which happened in 1839, when a\r\nvast mass of cliff, extending all the way from Pinhay (or Pinner) to\r\nCulverhole Point, slipped bodily down some 300 feet, carrying with it\r\nfields and houses; and it now lies in most picturesque ruin on the beach.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the Axe, above whose eastern side rises the Haven Cliff, a\r\nfine mass of red sandstone crowned by white chalk, has long since been\r\nsilted up by pebbles, and no ships now visit either Axmouth or Seaton,\r\nthe latter of which was once of sufficient importance to contribute\r\ntwo vessels towards Edward III's expedition against Calais, but is now\r\nonly a watering-place. Beyond the mouth of the Axe, separated from it\r\nby a mile of low-lying shore, the White Cliff, also a scene of many\r\nlandslips, rises sheer up out of the sea; a fine piece of cliff-wall,\r\nthe effect of whose bands of red and white, of brown and grey, is\r\ngreatly heightened by the green of its abundant vegetation. More\r\nstriking still is the white precipice of Beer Head, the most southerly\r\noutcrop of chalk in England, worn above into picturesque and ivy-mantled\r\ncrags, and hollowed at its base into many caves. From its summit, 426\r\nfeet above the sea, is a far-reaching view of the coast, covering the\r\n50 miles from Portland on the east to the Start on the west. Half-way\r\nbetween the mouth of the Axe and Beer Head is the quaint and old-world\r\nvillage of Beer, famous for its labyrinthine quarries tunnelled deep\r\ninto the hill, for its fisheries and lace-making, and, formerly, as a\r\nspecial haunt of smugglers. From Beer Head, past the little openings of\r\nBranscombe Mouth, Weston Mouth, and Salcombe, to Sidmouth, is a range\r\nof magnificent and picturesquely-coloured cliffs, white and grey and\r\nyellow, and at some points rising straight up from the sea-line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pinhay Landslip]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: White Cliff, Seaton]\r\n\r\nSidmouth, the \"Baymouth\" of Thackeray's _Pendennis_, set among beautiful\r\nhills, and one of the pleasantest of west-country watering-places, was\r\nonce a port, with valuable pilchard fisheries. But its harbour has\r\nbeen destroyed by repeated falls of rock from its grand cliffs of\r\ndeep red sandstone, the Sid is silted up with sand and shingle, and\r\nthe pilchards have left this part of the coast. About a mile west of\r\nSidmouth is the beautiful headland of High Peak, whose summit, 511 feet\r\nabove the sea, is the most lofty point on the south coast of Devon.\r\nJust beyond it is the popular bathing-place of Ladram Cove, whose firm\r\nsands are fringed with brightly-coloured pebbles. Rather more than two\r\nmiles farther on is the estuary of the Otter, a harbour 500 years ago,\r\nbut now, like so many of these river mouths, barred with shingle. Close\r\nto the estuary lies the quiet little town of Budleigh Salterton, set\r\nin a beautiful valley, famous for its mild climate and its luxuriant\r\nvegetation. Some five miles of coast-line--broken half-way by Straight\r\nPoint, beyond which the shore is low--extend from Budleigh to the mouth\r\nof the Exe, the widest of Devonshire estuaries, but almost closed by a\r\nlong bar of grass-grown sand called the Warren, on which, during the\r\nCivil War, stood a Royalist fort mounting sixteen guns. Exmouth, at the\r\neast side of the estuary, formerly a fishing-village, is now a highly\r\npopular watering-place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Parson and Clerk Rocks, Dawlish]\r\n\r\nFour miles farther on, in a little bay walled-in by lofty cliffs\r\nof deep red sandstone, is Dawlish, noted for its warm climate and\r\nits good sands. At the eastern end of the bay is a rock called the\r\nLangstone, and at the western end are the strange-looking pillars of\r\nred sandstone known as the Parson and Clerk. Teignmouth lies rather\r\nmore than two miles S.S.W. of Dawlish, with picturesque red cliffs and\r\nfirm sands all the way, at the mouth of the estuary of the river Teign,\r\nwhose swiftly-flowing stream is here crossed by one of the longest\r\nwooden bridges in England. It is a small port and a very popular\r\nwatering-place, with beautiful inland scenery behind it, and inside\r\nthe Den--the dune or sand-bank which bars a great part of the river's\r\nmouth--is a good harbour for vessels of light draught. Teignmouth is\r\none of the towns that in the past have suffered from the attacks of the\r\nFrench, who burnt it in 1347 and again in 1690.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Anstis Cove, near Torquay]\r\n\r\nFour miles south of the estuary of the Teign is Babbacombe Bay, in whose\r\nbeautiful cliffs of red and grey is some of the richest colouring on the\r\nwhole coast. The paler-toned cliffs round the picturesque little inlet\r\nof Anstis Cove are of limestone. Half a mile farther is the prominent\r\ncape called Hope's Nose, the northern limit of Torbay, and a spot\r\nof much interest to the geologist on account of the raised sea-beach\r\nwhich, at a height of some thirty feet above the present high tide-line,\r\nmay be traced under the headland, and also, at a lower level, on the\r\nThatcher Rock. Among the marine shells of the latter deposit is _Trophon\r\ntruncatus_, an arctic species, whose presence here is another proof that\r\nthe climate of Devonshire was once far colder than it is now.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Torquay from Vane Hill]\r\n\r\nTorbay, which extends from Hope's Nose on the north to Berry Head on\r\nthe south--two prominent headlands nearly five miles apart--is one of\r\nthe best known and most beautiful bays on the coast of England. In all\r\nexcept easterly winds it affords an excellent anchorage which was much\r\nused by ships of the Royal Navy in the old sailing days, and it\r\nis still a great yachting station. At the northern end of the bay,\r\noccupying, it is said, more ground in proportion to its population than\r\nany other town in the island, is the much frequented watering-place\r\nof Torquay, widely celebrated for the beauty of its situation and the\r\nmildness of its winter climate. Along the whole coast of Torbay, at\r\na level which shows that the land has sunk some forty feet, lies a\r\nsubmerged forest, in which have been found bones of the wild boar,\r\nred-deer antlers, and mammoth's teeth. But proofs of an elevation on a\r\nstill greater scale are to be found in the borings of sea-shells in the\r\nlimestone cliffs above Kent's Cavern, within the limits of the town, at\r\na height of 200 feet above the present sea level.\r\n\r\nHalf-way along the shore of Torbay is Paignton, another favourite\r\nseaside resort, famous for its fine beach, and on a steep slope at the\r\nhead of an inlet rather more than a mile before coming to Berry Head\r\nstands Brixham, a town second only in importance to Plymouth among\r\nthe fishing-stations of the south coast of England. Here, on the 5th\r\nof November, 1688, the Prince of Orange landed. And here, six weeks\r\nafter the Battle of Waterloo, the _Bellerophon_ anchored, with Napoleon\r\nBuonaparte a prisoner on board.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Brixham]\r\n\r\nBeyond Berry Head, which forms the end of a broad promontory, worn at\r\nits base into many caves, and noted for its quarries, there extends\r\nfor many miles--all the way, in fact, to the mouth of the Dart--a\r\nstretch of very beautiful coast-line, with low but finely-coloured\r\ncliffs of sandstone and limestone and slate, varying in tint from red\r\nto purple, and from brown to grey, with a series of sandy bays and\r\nfringed by outlying rocks, two of which are called Mewstones. One of\r\nthese, standing just where the coast sweeps round to the estuary of\r\nthe Dart, is a lofty pinnacle of stone more than 100 feet high. Well\r\ninside the mouth of the Dart, on the steep slope of its left or eastern\r\nentrance, is the quaint little town of Kingswear; and opposite to it,\r\non the western shore, lies Dartmouth, once a noted port, but now only\r\na favourite yachting station. The old man-of-war, the _Britannia_,\r\nanchored here close to land and long used as a training-ship, has been\r\nsuperseded by a naval college on shore, and is now used only as a store.\r\nDartmouth is a place of much historic interest. It was from here that\r\npart of Richard C[oe]ur de Lion's crusading fleet sailed for Palestine.\r\nThe port furnished thirty-one ships towards Edward III's attack on\r\nCalais. Twice, in the half century that followed, it was plundered by\r\nthe French. It played a prominent part in the Civil War, and was taken\r\nfirst by Prince Maurice, and afterwards by Fairfax.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The \"Britannia\" and \"Hindostan\" in Dartmouth Harbour]\r\n\r\nBetween the mouth of the Dart and Start Point, nine miles as the crow\r\nflies, is Start Bay, walled for about half its length with low and\r\nquiet-coloured cliffs of slate, and fringed in great part with sand\r\nand shingle. At Blackpool, a picturesque little cove near the northern\r\nend of the bay, du Chastel the Breton landed, in 1404, on a pillaging\r\nexpedition, for the plundering was not all on the side of the English.\r\nBut the Frenchman was killed, with 400 of his men, and 200 more were\r\ntaken prisoners. Half-way along the shore of Start Bay are Slapton\r\nSands, where a beach of small and brightly-coloured pebbles and a\r\nbank of shingle separate the long and narrow lake called Slapton Ley\r\nfrom the waters of the Channel. Off this spot, marked by two beacons\r\non the shore, is the spot, \"measured mile\" for testing the speed of\r\nsteamships. Not far from Slapton the coast rises again, and above the\r\nfishing villages of Hallsands and Beesands, which stand at the water's\r\nedge, reaches a height of some hundreds of feet. The people of these two\r\nlittle hamlets train powerful dogs, which, in rough weather, swim out\r\nthrough the surf, catch the painters thrown to them and thus enable the\r\nfishing-boats to be dragged ashore.\r\n\r\nStart Point, or, as it is perhaps more often called, the Start, is one\r\nof the famous capes of Britain, a bold headland sloping steeply both\r\nways, like the roof of a house; whose iron base, fringed with white\r\nquartz pebbles; has been the scene of many shipwrecks, and whose dark\r\ncliffs and rugged crags are haunted by multitudes of sea-birds. The\r\ncliffs of this part of Devon, from the Start round Prawle Point and Bolt\r\nHead to Bolt Tail--cliffs whose grey rock, relieved by bands of white\r\nquartz, has been bent and twisted by volcanic upheaval, and weathered\r\nby rain and frost, by wind and sea, into the wildest and most fantastic\r\nshapes--are as remarkable for picturesqueness of form as other parts\r\nare for richness of colouring. Three miles beyond the Start is Prawle\r\nPoint, a magnificent mass of jagged rock, the most southerly point in\r\nthe county, and a well-known steering-mark for ships in the Channel. It\r\nwas off this shore, in 1793, that the English ship _Nymphe_ captured\r\nthe French man-of-war _Cléopatre_; the first naval battle in the\r\nstruggle between England and the French Republic. Between Prawle Point\r\nand Bolt Head is Salcombe Mouth, a creek rather than an estuary; a long,\r\nwinding, and picturesque inlet, whose entrance is obstructed by a bank\r\nof sand. Trunks of oak and other trees, from a submerged forest not far\r\nfrom land, are sometimes thrown ashore here after rough weather. To the\r\nwest of Salcombe stands Bolt Head, of no great height, but a noble mass\r\nof rugged and weather-worn rock. Beyond the Head the coast rises into\r\nsteep and lofty cliffs, culminating in Bolt Tail, close under whose\r\neastern face, in 1760, the 74-gun ship _Ramillies_ was lost, with more\r\nthan 700 of her crew. A gun recovered from the wreck lies by the Hope\r\nsignal-station, on the height above. These cliffs have been much broken\r\naway by landslips; and a series of fissures called the Pits suggest that\r\nmuch more ground is still to fall.\r\n\r\nRound Bigbury Bay, of which Bolt Tail is the eastern limit, is some of\r\nthe most beautiful scenery of this beautiful coast. A striking feature\r\nof the bay is a great rock called the Thurlestone, an outlying mass of\r\nred sandstone, conspicuous against the general greyness of the cliffs,\r\nand pierced by a lofty archway, worn by wind and sea. Two estuaries,\r\nthe Avon Mouth and the Erme Mouth, break the coast-line of the bay; and\r\nthere is a third, called Yealm Mouth, near the entrance of Plymouth\r\nSound, a couple of miles beyond the grand slate headland of Stoke Point.\r\nOutside the Avon Mouth is Borough Island, carpeted in spring-time with\r\nthe beautiful blue of the delicate little vernal squill. The Erme,\r\nwhose mouth is guarded by rugged cliffs of slate, is strewn with rocks\r\nand sandbanks; but the estuary of the Yealm is a fine sheet of deep,\r\nnavigable water. Standing far out into Wembury Bay, at the mouth of\r\nthe Yealm, is the third of the Mewstones, a rocky and beautiful little\r\nislet, nearly 200 feet high, and frequented, as its name implies, by\r\nmany sea-gulls.\r\n\r\nThe Mewstone may be said to mark the eastern side of the entrance\r\nof Plymouth Sound, one of the best known, most important, and most\r\nbeautiful bays in the kingdom. It is by nature fully exposed to\r\nsoutherly winds, and it has, in the past, been the scene of many\r\nshipwrecks. But the breakwater, which was built in the early half of\r\nthe nineteenth century right across it, two miles south of Plymouth\r\nHoe, with the special object of sheltering ships of the Royal Navy, now\r\naffords a safe and excellent anchorage. Nearer the shore is Drake's\r\nIsland, now strongly fortified, but in Stuart times a State prison,\r\nwhere Lambert, one of the most distinguished of Parliamentary generals,\r\nspent the last eighteen years of his life.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the Sound, on its eastern side, is the inlet called\r\nthe Catwater, the estuary of the river Plym, an important mercantile\r\nanchorage, protected by Batten breakwater. It was here that the English\r\nFleet waited until the Spanish Armada, on its way up the Channel, had\r\npassed the entrance of the Sound.\r\n\r\nBetween the Catwater and the Hamoaze, the great naval anchorage which\r\nextends from the Sound to Saltash Bridge, are the \"Three Towns,\"\r\nPlymouth, Stonehouse, and Devonport, now joined into one by continuous\r\nbuildings, forming the busiest and most populous part of the county,\r\nand constituting, with their dockyards, barracks, gun-wharves, and\r\nvictualling yards, one of the most important stations of the Royal Navy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10. Coastal Gains and Losses. Sandbanks. Lighthouses.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are parts of our island where, even within historic times, the\r\ncoast-line has been greatly changed by the encroachment of the sea,\r\nusually through the wearing away of the cliffs along the shore. This\r\nis especially the case on the eastern coast of England, where, in the\r\nlapse of ages, villages, towns, and whole manors have been completely\r\nswept away. The old town of Ravenspur, for example, a place that in its\r\ntime rivalled Hull as a sea-port, is to-day a mere sandbank far out from\r\nshore; and the sea runs twenty feet deep over the once great shipping\r\ntown of Dunwich, whose site is now two miles from the land.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are places where the reverse has happened;\r\nwhere the shore has gained upon the sea. The town of Yarmouth, for\r\ninstance, stands on ground that first became firm enough to build\r\nupon nine hundred years ago. A large tract of land on the coast of\r\nCarnarvonshire has, in times much more recent, been reclaimed from the\r\nsea; and the day cannot be far distant when the mud-flats of the Wash\r\nwill be under the plough.\r\n\r\nSimilar changes--changes resulting both from gain and loss--have\r\nhappened and are still happening in Devonshire. Braunton Great Field,\r\na rich tract of land some 300 acres in extent, cut up into hundreds of\r\nsmall freeholds, was, it is believed, reclaimed from the estuary of the\r\nTaw. On the other hand, the Pebble Ridge on the shore of Barnstaple Bay\r\nhas been slowly driven inland by the force of the sea, and is said to\r\nhave advanced 200 yards in the last fifty years, thus covering a long\r\nstretch of pasture-land under heaps of stones. Attempts have been lately\r\nmade, by means of piles and groynes of timber, to stop its further\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nMuch more remarkable, however, and much more widely distributed, are\r\nthe alterations that have taken place on the south coast of Devonshire,\r\nowing mainly to erosion of the cliffs and consequent landslips, and\r\nto the washing up, by strong currents, of vast quantities of sand and\r\nshingle. From the Dorset border westwards, especially between Pinhay\r\nBay and Culverhole Point, in the White Cliff near Seaton, and at Beer\r\nHead, long stretches of cliff, undermined probably by streams and heavy\r\nrains, have fallen, sometimes in masses half a mile long. The old town\r\nof Sidmouth is now buried under the shingle, the cliffs that protected\r\nthe harbour having been entirely washed away. At Dawlish, again, rather\r\nmore than fifty years since, a mass estimated at 4000 tons fell bodily\r\ninto the sea. Nor is the erosion the work of natural forces alone. In\r\n1897 immense quantities of fine shingle were taken from the beach at\r\nHallsands, to make concrete for Keyham dockyard, with the result that\r\nthe beach there has sunk twelve feet, that high-water mark is now much\r\nfarther in-shore, and that many houses in the village have been swept\r\naway by the sea, whose further inroads have at last been checked by\r\nmeans of massive walls of concrete.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Rough Sea at Ilfracombe]\r\n\r\nMost of the south coast estuaries, as has already been pointed out, have\r\nbeen more or less blocked up by banks of sand or shingle, some of which\r\nare still undergoing change. The Warren, for example, the great bar at\r\nthe mouth of the Exe, now connected with the western shore, was in the\r\nseventeenth century joined to the Exmouth side of the river, and was\r\nstill reached from there by stepping-stones as late as 1730. The Warren\r\nis now being slowly washed away, at the rate, it is said, of an acre in\r\na year; and the river has within historic times encroached upon the site\r\nof Newenham Abbey.\r\n\r\nGreat as has been the loss of land on the south coast, there have\r\nbeen some gains. More than 170 acres of land, for instance, have\r\nbeen reclaimed from the Laira near Plymouth; and the village of\r\nPenny-come-quick, lower down, whose anglicised Celtic name means \"the\r\nhouse at the head of the creek,\" is no longer at the water's edge. In\r\n1805 some thirty acres were recovered from the Charleston marshes, on\r\nthe Salcombe estuary.\r\n\r\nThe Bristol Channel is one of the most stormy and dangerous parts\r\nof the British seas, and is the scene of about one-tenth of all the\r\nshipping disasters that happen on our coasts every year. In its upper\r\nreaches navigation is made difficult by banks of mud and sand which\r\nare continually altering in shape and position. On the north coast of\r\nDevonshire, however, there are no outlying sandbanks. There is a small\r\npatch of sand off Lynmouth, 1-1/2 miles N.N.W. of Countisbury Foreland,\r\nand the estuary of the Taw and Torridge is obstructed by a dangerous and\r\nshifting sandbank known as Barnstaple Bar, upon which (\"the harbour bar\"\r\nof Kingsley's song), many vessels have been wrecked. But the dangers of\r\nthis stormy shore lie mainly in the iron-bound coast itself, and in the\r\nrocks that stretch seaward from the bases of the cliffs. From Bull Point\r\nto Baggy Point, especially off Morte Point, and again from Clovelly to\r\nthe border of Cornwall, particularly off Hartland Point, the shore is\r\nfringed with reefs and sharp edges of rock.\r\n\r\nLundy, again, is a constant source of danger to sailors; partly because\r\nof the many rocks that stretch out from it, especially the Hen and\r\nChickens at the north end and the Lee Rocks at the south; partly because\r\nof the strong currents that, off the south point of the island, run\r\nfive knots an hour; and partly because of the fogs that so frequently\r\nenvelope it. It was all three clauses combined that, in 1906, occasioned\r\nthe loss of the first-class battleship _Montagu_, which, carried out of\r\nher course by the current, and deceived by the fog, became a total wreck\r\non the Shutter Rock, the southern extremity of the island. Off Lundy,\r\ntoo, are the only banks of importance. Over the Stanley Bank, which lies\r\nto the north-east, where the depth at one point is only four and a half\r\nfathoms, there run, in heavy weather, the dangerous \"tide-rips\" known as\r\nthe White Horses.\r\n\r\nThe navigation of the south shore of Devonshire is much more important\r\nthan that of the north; partly because of the number of ports in the\r\ncounty itself, and partly because the English Channel is a much more\r\ncrowded waterway.\r\n\r\nThe principal danger to navigation on the south coast is the group of\r\nreefs called the Eddystone Rocks, fourteen miles south-south-west of\r\nthe entrance of Plymouth Sound. They are all covered at high tide,\r\nbut the top of one of them is nineteen feet above low-water mark. In\r\nPlymouth Sound itself, especially near the eastern shore, there are many\r\nrocks and shallow patches. The most conspicuous of the former is the\r\nMewstone, 194 feet high. On the Shagstone, a little farther in, the P.\r\nand O. steamship _Nepaul_ was lost. From this point eastward the coast\r\nis fringed with rocks and small islets, most of them close in-shore. But\r\nfrom the Start a chain of sandbanks called the Skerries extends out some\r\nmiles from the land. From Bigbury Bay to the Start is one of the most\r\ndangerous parts of the coast, and has been the scene of many wrecks.\r\nHere, to name a few of many instances, were lost the _Ramillies_, of\r\nwhose crew 708 were drowned; the _Chanteloupe_, when only one man was\r\nsaved; the _Marana_, from which seven men escaped; and the _Dryad_, on\r\nwhich every man perished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Eddystone Lighthouse]\r\n\r\nFrom the mouth of the Dart to Hope's Nose there are many outlying\r\nrocks; but from that headland to the Dorsetshire border the coast is\r\ncomparatively \"clean,\" that is to say, free from obstructions. All the\r\nrivers east of Plymouth Sound are more or less blocked by bars, with the\r\nexception of the Dart, whose entrance, however, is strewn with rocks.\r\n\r\nTo warn the sailor against these and other dangers, buoys, bells,\r\nbeacons, fog-horns or sirens, guns or explosive signals, and lighthouses\r\nhave been provided at many points along the Devonshire coasts. There are\r\nalso numerous storm-signalling stations, and there are no fewer than\r\nthirteen lifeboats, of which eight are on the south coast. The men of\r\nthe thirty-three Devonshire Coastguard stations have been the means of\r\nsaving many lives.\r\n\r\nOn the two coasts, including Lundy, there are in all fifty-one lights\r\nof various sorts and sizes, from the eight first-class lighthouses with\r\nmassive stone towers, of which the most famous although not the most\r\npowerful is the Eddystone, down to the small but useful lights of a\r\nhundred candle-power or less, most of which are connected with quays\r\nand harbours; while others, like that at Clovelly, lighted only in the\r\nfishing-season, are temporary, a number of them consisting merely of\r\na lantern on the top of a post. A hut that carries the red and white\r\nlights at the mouth of the Barnstaple river is on wheels, and is moved\r\nas the bar shifts its position.\r\n\r\nThe first Eddystone lighthouse, a fantastic structure of wood, with six\r\nstages, begun in 1690 by Winstanley--who, while engaged in building it,\r\nwas carried off by a French privateer, but promptly released by command\r\nof Louis XIV--was swept away, with its builder and three other men, in\r\nthe historic storm of 1703. The second lighthouse, also of wood, built\r\nby Rudyerd in 1706, was destroyed by fire in 1755. The third, which\r\nwas the first real lighthouse ever erected, was constructed by Smeaton\r\nof stones dovetailed together, with a shaft eighty-seven feet high,\r\nshaped like the trunk of an oak-tree for the sake of strength, and with\r\nthe idea that it would offer greater resistance to the waves. It was\r\nfinished in 1759, but its woodwork having been burnt in 1770 was then\r\nreplaced by stone. The foundations of this tower having been undermined\r\nby the sea, a fourth lighthouse, whose top is 133 feet above high-water\r\nmark, was built by Douglas, between 1878 and 1882, on a rock forty\r\nyards south-south-east of the original site, which is nine miles and a\r\nquarter from the nearest land. Part of the old tower was taken down,\r\nand re-erected on Plymouth Hoe, in memory of Smeaton. Like most of the\r\nDevonshire lights the Eddystone lantern is of the group-flashing order,\r\ngiving a light equal to that of nearly 300,000 candles, with two quick\r\nflashes every half-minute, and visible in clear weather for seventeen\r\nmiles. A minor fixed light, in the same tower, shines on the Hand Deeps,\r\na bank to the north-west; and the lighthouse is also provided with an\r\nexplosive fog-signal, giving two reports every five minutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Start Lighthouse]\r\n\r\nOther very powerful lights, visible for from seventeen to twenty-one\r\nmiles, are--giving them in ascending order--those at Hartland, Bull\r\nPoint, Countisbury Foreland, North Lundy, the Start, and South Lundy,\r\nthe last named being the most brilliant of all, of 374,225 candle-power.\r\nAll these lighthouses have fog-sirens or explosive fog-signals.\r\n\r\nMost of the English lighthouses are under the charge of the Trinity\r\nHouse, a corporation founded in 1512, and now having a yearly revenue\r\nof £300,000, derived from \"light-dues\" levied on shipping. The expense\r\nof keeping up the lighthouses of the United Kingdom in 1909 amounted,\r\nhowever, to £464,540. The early beacon-lights were simply fires of coal,\r\nand one of these was in use at St Bees Head as recently as 1812. There\r\nare now round the coasts of Britain more than a thousand lighthouses\r\nand lights of various degrees of importance, from those at the Lizard\r\nand at St Catherine's Point, which are the most brilliant in the world,\r\nand may be reckoned in millions of candles, down to insignificant\r\nlittle structures, of which there are many, like the 100-candle-power\r\n\"Jack-in-the-Box\" on the river Tees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11. Climate and Rainfall.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe climate of any country, or in other words, its average weather, by\r\nwhich, again, we mean its temperature, rainfall, and hours of sunshine,\r\nas well as the dryness or otherwise of its air, depends upon various\r\ncircumstances and conditions, but especially upon geographical position,\r\nthat is to say, upon the nearness of the country to the equator, upon\r\nits distance from the sea and its height above sea-level; partly\r\nalso upon its soil and vegetation. Speaking generally, the nearer we\r\napproach the equator the hotter will be the climate, and the nearer\r\nto the sea-coast the milder and more equable it will be. The highest\r\ntemperature in the shade ever yet recorded, however--127° Fahr.--was in\r\nthe Algerian Sahara, at a spot not even within the tropics; and the\r\ngreatest cold ever experienced, 90° below zero, Fahr., was at a place in\r\nSiberia only just within the arctic circle.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the British Isles is very greatly influenced by the\r\ngreat ocean current, often called the Gulf Stream, from its supposed\r\nsource in the Gulf of Mexico, which, impelled by steady winds, carries\r\na constant stream of warm water from the equatorial regions towards the\r\nnorth pole. This current washes the shores of these islands, and it is\r\nthis circumstance which makes our winters so much milder than those of\r\nLabrador, which is no nearer to the pole than we are. Were it not for\r\nthe Gulf Stream our weather would probably be more severe than that of\r\nNewfoundland.\r\n\r\nThe highest shade temperature ever experienced in Britain was 101°\r\nFahr., at Alton in Hampshire, in July, 1881; and the lowest was\r\n10° below zero, Fahr., at Buxton in Derbyshire, in February, 1895.\r\nA temperature of 23° below zero is said to have been measured in\r\nBerwickshire, in 1879, but the correctness of the record has been\r\nquestioned. What is, however, of more importance, is the average\r\ntemperature for the year, which, for the whole of England, is 48° Fahr.\r\n\r\nThe sunniest part of England lies, as might be expected, along the south\r\ncoast, although the south-east and south-west coasts also get more\r\nsunshine than inland districts in the same latitude. The sun is above\r\nthe horizon in this country for more than 4450 hours in the year; but,\r\nowing to the frequent presence of clouds, he is not visible for even\r\nhalf that time in any part of the British Isles and the average for the\r\ncountry as a whole is only 1355 hours. The southern coasts sometimes\r\nenjoy 2000 hours of bright sunshine in a year, but their average is\r\nprobably not more than 1700 or 1800 hours, or about five hours a day\r\nall the year round. The amount decreases as we go north; while the\r\nmanufacturing districts of the midland counties, owing to the smoke\r\nwhich so often obscures the sky, get 1200 hours or less. At Manchester\r\nin 1907 only 894 hours of sunshine were recorded for the year's total.\r\nThe sunniest months throughout the country generally are May and June,\r\nand the gloomiest month is December.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Winter Garden at Torquay]\r\n\r\nThe climate of a country, however, depends not only upon the sunshine,\r\nbut upon the rainfall. The amount of rain that falls in any place\r\nvaries according to the height of that place above the sea, its distance\r\nfrom the coast, and the configuration of the ground, that is to say,\r\nupon its position with respect to valleys, up which moisture-laden\r\nair may be driven by the wind, to be compressed and cooled until its\r\nmoisture falls in rain.\r\n\r\nThe rainfall varies very much in different parts of England, but the\r\naverage amount for the whole country is about 33 inches in a year. When\r\nwe speak of an inch of rain we mean that it would lie an inch deep on a\r\nperfectly level piece of ground. Thus, if all the rain that fell in a\r\nyear stayed on the ground, and did not evaporate, or run away, or sink\r\ninto the earth, the water would be 33 inches deep all over England at\r\nthe end of the twelve months. An inch of rain all over an acre of ground\r\nweighs rather more than 100 tons. Not only does the rainfall vary in\r\ndifferent parts of the country, but it varies in different years. The\r\nwettest year on record was 1903, when the rainfall averaged 50 inches\r\nfor the whole of England; and the driest year was 1887, when it amounted\r\nto no more than 24 inches.\r\n\r\nThe heaviest rainfall in Great Britain is in the mountains round Ben\r\nNevis and Snowdon, in the English Lake District, and in the uplands of\r\nCornwall and Devon. And it may fairly accurately be said that, as we\r\ncross England from west to east, the amount of the annual fall steadily\r\ndecreases, as is shown in the accompanying map. The moisture-laden\r\nclouds, driven across the Atlantic by the prevalent S.W. winds,\r\ndischarge their contents on meeting the cold high lands of western\r\nEngland, which thus act as a sort of umbrella, the driest parts of\r\nthe country being on the east coast. While the average fall over a\r\nconsiderable part of the west side of it is from 40 to 60 inches, that\r\non the east is no more than from 25 to 30; and round the Wash and in\r\nparts of Suffolk and Essex it is under 25 inches. Thus it sometimes\r\nhappens that when the west of England has rain enough and to spare, the\r\neastern districts are suffering from the want of it. The effect of this\r\ndifference is shown in a marked degree in the character of the crops.\r\nThe farms of the rainier west are to a great extent laid down in grass.\r\nThe drier districts of the east grow more corn, which needs dry weather\r\nto ripen it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENGLAND & WALES ANNUAL RAINFALL (_The figures give the\r\napproximate annual rainfall in inches._)]\r\n\r\nThe driest month in England generally is March, whose rainfall averages\r\n1·46 inches; and the wettest is October, in which the average amount is\r\n2·81 inches.\r\n\r\nThe pleasant climate of Devonshire, which is highly conducive to health\r\nand to extreme longevity, and which, especially in the south, favours\r\nluxuriant and even sub-tropical vegetation, owes its character to five\r\nmain causes;--the fact that the county is bounded on two sides by the\r\nsea; the influence of the Gulf Stream or warm ocean current, which\r\ndirectly affects both coasts; the warmth and moisture of the prevailing\r\nwinds; the shelter afforded to the southern districts by the high ground\r\nof Dartmoor; and the large amount of bright sunshine which the county,\r\nand especially the south of it, is favoured.\r\n\r\nIt is owing to the Gulf Stream that the temperature of the sea in the\r\nEnglish Channel is many degrees higher in winter, even as far east as\r\nthe Goodwins, than that in the North Sea. Thus, the east wind, blowing\r\nover 200 miles of warmed water, has, by the time it reaches Devonshire,\r\nlost much of its proverbial bitterness. On the other hand it is mainly\r\nowing to the influence of the Gulf Stream that the climate of Ilfracombe\r\nis more equable than that of any other town in England except Falmouth,\r\nand is, in fact, from half a degree to a degree warmer in winter and\r\ncooler in summer than Torquay itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Upcott Lane, Bideford]\r\n\r\nIt is largely the shelter given to it by Dartmoor and the Blackdown\r\nHills that makes the south and south-east of Devonshire so famous for\r\nits warm and pleasant climate. The south-west also benefits from the\r\nprotection afforded by the spurs of Dartmoor, but the rainfall of that\r\ndistrict is heavier and the air more relaxing.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing winds in Devonshire are the west and south-west, which,\r\nblowing across the open Atlantic, are also the chief rain-carrying\r\nwinds. Both are comparatively warm, the latter following the course\r\nof the Gulf Stream. But they are often violent, and vegetation fully\r\nexposed to them does not flourish.\r\n\r\nThe peninsula of which Devonshire forms a part contains the warmest\r\ndistricts in Great Britain. The annual average temperature of the whole\r\ncounty is 49-1/2° Fahr., which is a degree and a half higher than that\r\nof the whole of England; while the average for Torquay is 51°. In the\r\nthree winter months, January, February, and March, in which the average\r\ntemperature for London is 39·7°, that for Torquay is 41·3°.\r\n\r\nThe annual amount of bright sunshine in Devonshire naturally varies\r\nin different years. In 1906 it was nearly 2000 hours on the south\r\ncoast, and not less than 1800 on the north. The average amount appears,\r\nhowever, to be about 1700 in the south, and 1500 on the north coast, or\r\nbetween three and four hours a day. The actual amount would, of course,\r\nbe much more than this in summer, and much less in the winter.\r\n\r\nThe amount of rain in Devonshire in 1907, which was an average year\r\nthroughout the country, was (taking the mean of the 169 stations named\r\nin Dr H. R. Mill's _British Rainfall_) 41·24 inches, falling on 210\r\ndays, or about 7-1/2 inches and 7 days above the average for the whole\r\nof England and Wales. In the same year 196.16 inches of rain were\r\nregistered at the Llyn Llydaw Copper Mine near Snowdon, and only 16·6\r\ninches at Clacton-on-Sea. The wettest part of the county is Dartmoor,\r\nwhich catches the moisture-laden clouds coming up from the Atlantic.\r\nIn 1907 some 81 inches of rain fell at Princetown, at a spot 1390 feet\r\nabove the sea. This amount was, however, much exceeded in 1903, when the\r\nrainfall at the same station was 102·32 inches, and in Cowsic Valley,\r\na little lower down, it was half an inch more. The driest part of\r\nDevonshire is the south-east coast. In 1907 only 26·27 inches of rain\r\nfell at Exmouth, for example. Heavy as the rainfall is, the slopes of\r\nthe land are so steep and the soil in general so porous that the water\r\nsoon runs away, with the result that both the earth and the air are\r\ndrier than might be expected.\r\n\r\nA feature of Dartmoor even more striking and characteristic than its\r\nheavy rainfall is the fog which so frequently covers it, and which is\r\nsometimes so dense as to cause the most experienced moor-men to lose\r\ntheir way.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, the climate of Devonshire may be described as warm\r\nand moist and remarkably equable. The winters are very mild, and snow\r\nis rare, except on Dartmoor. On the south coast of the county many\r\nplants which in less favoured parts of England need protection in the\r\nwinter, such, for instance, as geraniums, hydrangeas, heliotropes, and\r\ncamellias, are left out-of-doors all the year. Magnolias reach to the\r\ntops of the houses, myrtles grow to a height of thirty feet or more,\r\npalms and eucalyptus flourish, and oranges, lemons, and citrons do well\r\nin the open air.\r\n\r\nDevonshire seems peculiarly liable to seismic disturbances, and many\r\nslight shocks of earthquake have been recorded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12. People--Race. Dialects. Settlements. Population.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest inhabitants of Devonshire, the people of the Palaeolithic\r\nor Early Stone Age, have left few traces beyond their weapons and\r\nimplements of flint. They lived in caves or on the banks of rivers. They\r\nwere hunters, and appear to have practised no craft but that of hunting,\r\nwhile their arts seem to have been almost if not entirely limited to the\r\nuse of fire and to the making of rude instruments of stone.\r\n\r\nBut during the Neolithic Period, as the Later Stone Age is called, the\r\ndistrict, it is believed, was invaded by an Iberian or Ivernian race\r\nfrom south-western Europe, a race possessing flocks and herds, with\r\na knowledge of many arts and crafts, such as spinning and weaving,\r\nthe making of pottery and of dug-out canoes, but having at first no\r\nacquaintance with the use of metal. They were of the same stock as the\r\nSilures of South Wales, and were probably dark-haired and black-eyed,\r\nround-headed and short of stature. Their descendants may, perhaps, still\r\nbe seen in the county, especially on the skirts of Exmoor, and it is\r\nquite possible that their breeds of domestic animals may be represented\r\nupon Devonshire farms to-day.\r\n\r\nThe Iberians were, it is thought, conquered and driven westward by the\r\nvery different Goidels or Gaels, a powerful Celtic race, tall, fair,\r\nlong-headed, much further advanced in arts and crafts, and to some\r\nextent users of bronze for tools and ornaments. It is thought by some\r\nauthorities that it was they who set up the stone circles, avenues,\r\nand menhirs, and who built the rude stone huts which still remain\r\non Dartmoor. Many of the people of Scotland and Ireland are their\r\ndescendants, and their language is still spoken in the Highlands and\r\nWestern Isles of Scotland, in parts of Ireland, and in the Isle of Man.\r\n\r\nThe Gaels were, it is believed, succeeded and conquered in the fourth\r\ncentury before Christ by the Brythons, another Celtic race, who gave\r\ntheir name to our island. They took possession of Wales, and of Scotland\r\nas far as the Highlands, but they do not appear to have crossed into\r\nIreland. They were, to a great extent, users of bronze, but they also\r\nworked in iron, and were the first of the Iron Age in this country. It\r\nis probable that they built most of the hill-forts of Devonshire, and\r\nthat they made many of the roads, some of which were afterwards adapted\r\nand improved by the Romans.\r\n\r\nShortly before the landing of Julius Caesar, Britain was invaded by\r\nstill another Celtic race, the Belgae from Gaul, a tall, dark-haired\r\npeople, as may be gathered from the appearance of their descendants, the\r\nWalloons of Liège and the Ardennes.\r\n\r\nThe Roman tenure of Devonshire was of a very limited character, and can\r\nhave had little effect upon the inhabitants. The Saxon occupation of the\r\ndistrict was more of the nature of colonisation than of conquest. By\r\nthe time they had crossed Somerset the Saxons were, at least nominally,\r\nChristians; and although their treatment of the original occupants was\r\nnone too gentle, as, for instance, in the expulsion of the Britons from\r\nExeter by Athelstan, it seems likely that the two races settled quietly\r\ndown together, the Saxons probably becoming the land-owners, and the\r\nCelts the peasantry. It is thought that the main population of the\r\ncounty is Celtic, of one or other of the three waves of Celtic invasion.\r\nThere are in Devonshire many Celtic place-names, especially of hills and\r\nrivers; and some of the latter, with the addition of Saxon endings, such\r\nas _ham_, _ton_, and _stock_, survive also in the names of towns. In\r\nsome cases, curious English-looking names can be traced to Celtic words\r\nof quite another meaning. Thus, Bowerman's Nose, the name of a famous\r\ncrag on Dartmoor, is probably a corruption of _Veor maen_, \"the great\r\nstone.\"\r\n\r\nThe dialect of Devonshire, like the very similar speech of west\r\nSomerset, is Saxon, with strong traces of Celtic influence in its\r\npronunciation. One of many peculiarities is the sound of the diphthongs\r\n_oo_ and _ou_, which are pronounced like the French _u_ or the German\r\n_ü_. Another peculiarity is the great variety of the vowel sounds,\r\nand the indistinctness or modification of some of the consonants.\r\nAgain, _th_ and even _v_ are often sounded like _dh_. It is also very\r\ncharacteristic to put _d_ for _th_ as, for instance, _datch_ for\r\n_thatch_, or _dishle_ for _thistle_.\r\n\r\nThere are many words in common use in Devonshire which are almost or\r\nentirely unknown elsewhere, and which may be regarded as survivals of\r\nancient Saxon or, in some cases, British speech. Such, for example,\r\nare:--\r\n\r\n    _whisht_, weird, uncanny, lonely, \"overlooked.\"\r\n    _cloam_, earthenware.\r\n    _clam_, a foot-bridge.\r\n    _yark_, lively.\r\n    _stivery_, disordered.\r\n    _clunk_, to swallow.\r\n    _giglets_, young men or women seeking new situations.\r\n    _havage_, character.\r\n    _zamzoaky_, tepid.\r\n    _coochey_, clumsy.\r\n    _mawn_, a basket.\r\n    _frickety_, heavy, sodden.\r\n    _pluff_, not well.\r\n    _spraggetty_, spotted.\r\n    _dimpety_, dusk.\r\n    _chicket_, cheerful.\r\n    _spilsky_, lean.\r\n    _fess_, smart.\r\n    _plum_, soft.\r\n    _scamlin_, irregular.\r\n    _thurdle_, miserable.\r\n    _sklum_, to grasp roughly.\r\n    _yaw_, to bite.\r\n    _shugg_, shy.\r\n    _ippet_, a lizard.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that some of the forms of Devonshire dialect\r\nwhich strike the educated ear as ungrammatical are really survivals of\r\npure Saxon speech, such as was in use at the courts of Alfred the Great\r\nand Athelstan. English in other parts of England has undergone great\r\nchanges. In the West Country it has in some respects kept closer to the\r\noriginal forms.\r\n\r\nThe Norman Conquest left its mark in many places. Double names, such\r\nas Berry Pomeroy, Sampford Courtenay, and Wear Gifford, suggest the\r\naddition of a Norman family title to the existing Saxon name of a manor.\r\nIt is quite possible that the common Devonshire word _fay_, as in _Yes,\r\nfay_ and _No, fay_, is a survival of the Old French _fay_ (for _foi_),\r\n\"faith.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Cockle Woman, River Exe]\r\n\r\nHuguenots and other French refugees have also at various times settled\r\nin the county, as, for instance, at Exeter, where they introduced the\r\nart of weaving tapestry, at Barnstaple, where they taught new and better\r\nmethods of making cloth, and at Plymouth, where many took refuge after\r\nthe Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. And it seems likely that Bratton\r\nFleming and Stoke Fleming were named after Flemish immigrants, many of\r\nwhom settled in Devonshire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Honiton Lace-Worker]\r\n\r\nThe population of the Geographical County of Devonshire, according to\r\nthe census of 1901, is 661,314, and there are in the county 123,608\r\ninhabited houses. A hundred years ago the population was 340,308; it\r\nhas, therefore, not quite doubled during the century. In the busier\r\ncounty of Kent the population has in the same time increased from\r\n268,097 to 1,348,841. In common with all except five of the counties of\r\nEngland, there are in Devonshire more women than men; the excess of the\r\nfemale over the male population being 37,096.\r\n\r\nThe chief occupation is agriculture, which provides employment\r\nfor 42,000 people, or about one-nineteenth of the inhabitants--a\r\nconsiderably lower proportion than in the adjoining county of Somerset.\r\nLess than 3000 men are engaged in mines and quarries; 2000 are\r\nfishermen, and lace-making occupies 350 men and 1500 women.\r\n\r\nIn common with many other parts of England the small country parishes\r\nof Devonshire are much less populous than they were. In the last fifty\r\nyears there has been a decline of 17,000 in the rural population.\r\n\r\nDevonshire is a somewhat thinly-inhabited county. There are in it a\r\nlittle more than 2-1/2 acres to every man, woman, and child, or 254\r\npersons to the square mile, compared with 558 to the square mile for the\r\nwhole of England and Wales. Westmorland, the most sparsely-populated\r\ncounty, has only 82 people to the square mile, or eight acres to each\r\ninhabitant. Lancashire, on the other hand, contains more than 2300\r\npeople to the square mile, or four people to every acre; and in the\r\ncounty of Middlesex there are 12,669 to the square mile, which gives\r\nabout twenty inhabitants to every acre of ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13. Agriculture--Main Cultivations. Woodlands. Stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe area of all the land in England is, in round numbers, 32-1/2\r\nmillions of acres, of which 24-1/2 millions are under cultivation;\r\n10-3/4 million acres being arable, and the greater part of the rest\r\nbeing devoted to permanent grass. For some years past the area of\r\ncultivation in the British Islands has been gradually growing less;\r\nand in 1908 the decrease in England alone was more than 25,000 acres,\r\nchiefly in the amount of land given up to barley and oats, but extending\r\nto almost all crops except wheat, potatoes, and lucerne, which showed\r\na slight advance. The cultivation of fruit, especially of small fruit,\r\ncontinues to increase, but the total space devoted to it is not quite\r\n300,000 acres.\r\n\r\nWith regard to live stock, the Government returns show that the total\r\nnumber of horses in England (about a million) was 10,000 less in 1908\r\nthan in 1907; but that the number of cattle (about five millions),\r\nof sheep (about sixteen millions), and of pigs (about two and a half\r\nmillions) had increased, especially in the case of sheep and pigs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Ford Farm, Bideford]\r\n\r\nDevonshire is eminently an agricultural county, having few industrial or\r\nmanufacturing centres, and still fewer mining interests, although in\r\nthe past it has been famous for weaving, and for tin and copper mining.\r\nThere is in the county a great variety of soil, from almost barren\r\nsand to the rich alluvial earth of the many river valleys, such as the\r\nvales of Honiton and Exeter, for example, and that not very clearly\r\ndefined tract of country called the South Hams, lying south of Dartmoor,\r\nincluding the district between the Tamar and the Teign, and containing\r\nsome of the most fertile land in England. The climate, as has been\r\nshown, is mild and equable, but the rainfall is heavy; and the farms of\r\nDevonshire, like those in the adjacent counties, are mainly devoted to\r\npasturage, although fruit-growing is an important industry. Red Devon\r\ncattle are well known and highly valued; and the sturdy little ponies\r\nof Exmoor and Dartmoor have been famous since Saxon times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Exmoor Ponies]\r\n\r\nAccording to the latest returns of the Ordnance Survey, Devonshire\r\ncontains, exclusive of water, more than a million and a half (1,667,154)\r\nacres, of which nearly a million and a quarter (1,211,648) are under\r\ncultivation, including rather more than 500,000 acres of arable land,\r\nand nearly 700,000 acres of permanent grass. The latter, which as will\r\nbe seen is more than half the cultivated area, is more than twice that\r\nin Dorset or Cornwall, rather more than that in Somerset, and is only\r\nexceeded in the much larger county of Yorkshire. It may be added that\r\nthe arable land was 11,000 acres less and the permanent grass 11,000\r\nacres more in 1908 than in 1907.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Red Devon Cow]\r\n\r\nCorn crops--which in the returns are made to include not only wheat,\r\nbarley, oats, and rye, but peas and beans--occupy altogether about\r\n200,000 acres, or one-sixth of the cultivated area. In this respect\r\nDevonshire surpasses the three adjoining counties, and is excelled by\r\nonly six English shires; Essex and Lincoln, where corn crops occupy\r\none-third of the area, Norfolk, where they are two-fifths, Cambridge and\r\nSuffolk, where they take up nearly one-half, and Yorkshire, where more\r\nthan half the cultivated area is thus occupied. With regard to wheat\r\nalone, the average yield per acre in Devonshire, for the last ten years,\r\nis only 26-1/4 bushels, which is lower than that of any other county in\r\nEngland except Monmouth.\r\n\r\nGreen crops other than permanent grass, and roots, occupy altogether\r\nabout 300,000 acres, an amount exceeded only in Norfolk and Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nDevonshire ranks very high as a fruit-growing county, and the area of\r\nits apple-orchards, about 27,000 acres, was, in 1908, greater than that\r\nof any other county in England. Apples are grown in many districts,\r\nbut especially in the Vale of Exeter, in the South Hams, and in the\r\nValley of the Dart. Much of the fruit is, however, grown only for making\r\ncider, and is of little value for the table. Plympton is said to have\r\nhad the first cider-orchard in England. When pears, plums, and cherries\r\nare included in the fruit returns, Devonshire takes third place, being\r\nsurpassed by Kent and Hereford. Vines are grown against many cottage\r\nwalls, as is the case in other southern counties; but it is remarkable,\r\nconsidering the mildness of the climate, that no Devonshire vineyard is\r\nmentioned in Domesday Book, although several are included in the survey\r\nfor Somerset.\r\n\r\nThe space devoted to small fruits--strawberries, raspberries, currants,\r\nand gooseberries--although showing a large comparative increase over\r\n1907, amounted in 1908 to no more than 1252 acres. In this respect\r\nDevonshire is fourteenth among the English counties, producing little\r\nmore than one-twentieth as much small fruit as Kent, for instance.\r\n\r\nDevonshire has no true forests. Dartmoor and Exmoor were so called\r\nin the sense of being unenclosed and uncultivated. But except on the\r\nmoors, the county is well-timbered, and its fine trees add greatly to\r\nits beauty. Its woods, plantations, and coppices amount altogether to\r\nnearly 90,000 acres, or about one-eighteenth of its whole area; and it\r\nhere ranks fifth among the shires of England. Sussex has the greatest\r\nproportion of woodland, about one-seventh of its total area; and\r\nCambridgeshire, with only one-ninety-second, has the least. There are\r\nconsiderable woods in some of the many beautiful parks; but probably the\r\nmost famous is the Wistman's Wood, near Two Bridges, the ancestors of\r\nwhose stunted and fantastic-looking oak-trees are mentioned in Domesday\r\nBook.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gathering Cider Apples]\r\n\r\nThe total number of agricultural holdings in Devonshire, in 1908, was\r\nnearly 15,000, or about one-twentieth of those in all England. This is\r\ngreater than that of any other county except Lancashire, Lincoln, and\r\nYorkshire. Nearly 3000 holdings are of five acres or less, and there are\r\nonly six other counties which have more of these small farms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Water-mill at Uplyme]\r\n\r\nThe numbers of the various kinds of live stock in Devonshire are large,\r\nand the county ranks very high under the four main heads. In cattle\r\n(295,000, or 2000 less than in 1907) it stands second in all England,\r\nbeing surpassed only by Yorkshire; in horses (59,000, or 1500 less than\r\nthe previous year) it is fourth; in sheep (900,000, or 29,000 more) it\r\nis fifth; and in pigs (106,000, or 5000 more) it is sixth. The average\r\nprice per stone of fat Devon cattle was higher in 1908 than that of any\r\nother breed in England, and the value per head of three-year-old Devon\r\nstore cattle was only exceeded by that of Herefords.\r\n\r\nThere is no cheese made in Devonshire to compare with the famous\r\n\"Cheddar\" of the neighbouring county; but Devonshire cream, although\r\nclosely rivalled by that of both Cornwall and Somerset, is known all\r\nover the kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14. Industries and Manufactures.\r\n\r\n\r\nDevonshire, although in former ages famous even on the continent of\r\nEurope for its cloth-weaving, no longer ranks as a manufacturing county.\r\nApart from agriculture and fishing, its industries are now mainly\r\nconfined to the making of lace and cider, to ship-building, and to the\r\nmanufacture of earthenware.\r\n\r\nThe prevalence in the county of the names of Webber and Tucker is some\r\nevidence of the extent and antiquity of the woollen trade, which, from\r\nvery early times, flourished all over Devonshire until the closing\r\nyears of the eighteenth century, when it was greatly checked by the\r\nintroduction of cotton fabrics. One of the most important seats of the\r\nmanufacture was Tiverton, where the industry was established in the\r\nfourteenth century, and reached perhaps its greatest height in the\r\nsixteenth. It was his success as a cloth-merchant which enabled Peter\r\nBlundell to found here his famous school. The chief woollen market\r\nof the county was originally at Crediton, but it was removed in the\r\nsixteenth century to Exeter, which long ranked second only to Leeds,\r\nand in its palmy days exported annually more than 300,000 pieces of\r\ncloth. Other important centres of the trade were Barnstaple, where\r\ntowards the end of the sixteenth century improved methods of weaving\r\nwere introduced by French refugees; Tavistock, whose kerseymeres had a\r\nEuropean reputation; Honiton, Cullompton, and Totnes. Now Ashburton and\r\nBuckfastleigh, where there are some manufactures of blankets and serges,\r\nare the only towns where the industry survives.\r\n\r\nLace-making, which has been a characteristic Devonshire industry for\r\nnearly three hundred years, is said to have been introduced at Honiton\r\nby Flemish refugees at the close of the sixteenth century, and to have\r\nbeen well established by 1630. The lace was a most costly product,\r\nchiefly because the special thread used in making it had to be imported\r\nfrom the Low Countries. In old days the price of Devonshire lace is\r\nsaid to have been reckoned by the number of shillings which would cover\r\nit. But the change of fashion in men's dress lessened the demand for\r\nlace; and the introduction of machinery in 1808 greatly diminished its\r\ncost. The piece of lace which in the eighteenth century would have cost\r\n£15, could be purchased a few years later for 15_s._, and can now be\r\nobtained, machine-made, for 15_d._ There was some revival of the trade\r\nafter the making, at Beer, of Queen Victoria's wedding-dress, at a\r\ncost of a thousand pounds. Schools were established for the training\r\nof lace-workers; and by 1870 the industry provided employment for 8000\r\npeople. The manufacture has, however, again greatly declined, and\r\nalthough there is a lace-factory at Tiverton, and although hand-made\r\nor pillow-lace is still worked in many cottages in the south-east,\r\nespecially at Beer, Colyton, and Seaton, the total number of\r\nlace-workers in the whole county, at the last census, was less than 2000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Devonshire Lace]\r\n\r\nCarpets in imitation of those of Turkey were first made at Axminster in\r\n1755, but in 1835 the looms were removed to Wilton, near Salisbury.\r\n\r\nThere are valuable deposits of various kinds of potter's clay in\r\nDevonshire, and although much of this is exported, a good deal is used\r\nin the county. There were formerly many small, scattered potteries in\r\nNorth Devon, but the chief seats of the industry now are at Bideford,\r\nwhere a good deal of rough pottery is made; at Annery, noted for its\r\nglazed bricks and tiles; and at Barnstaple, where are extensive and\r\nlong-established potteries of what is called Barum ware, which has been\r\ncompared to the Italian _sgraffito_. The potteries of Bovey Tracy,\r\nwhich use both local and imported clay, employ from 250 to 350 hands.\r\nThe fine red clay of Watcombe is used to make terra-cotta; and at Lee\r\nMoor, near Plympton, whence much kaolin or fine china clay is exported,\r\nthe silicious refuse is made up into bricks of high quality for use\r\nin metallurgical furnaces. The kaolin deposits of Devonshire were\r\ndiscovered by Cookworthy, who made porcelain at Plymouth from 1772 to\r\n1774, after which date the works were removed to Bristol.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Devonshire Pottery from the Watcombe Works]\r\n\r\nDevonshire is one of the chief cider-producing counties, and its\r\napple-orchards are the most extensive in our island. Some of the best\r\nvarieties of apples for cider-making--an industry which is carried\r\non throughout a very large part of the county though Totnes, Whimple,\r\nCrediton, Exeter and Tiverton are perhaps the best known centres--are\r\nKingston Black, both the sweet and the sour Woodbines (known locally as\r\nSlack-me-girdles), Sweet Alford and Fair Maid of Devon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cider-making in the 17th Century (_From an old print_)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Modern Cider Press]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that printing was early introduced into\r\nDevonshire. In 1525 the fifth printing-press in England was set up\r\nin Tavistock. There are paper-mills at Cullompton, iron-works near\r\nKingsbridge, glove-factories at Torrington, umber-works at Ashburton,\r\ntanneries and shoe-factories at Crediton, and agricultural implement\r\nworks at Exeter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ship-building Yard, Brixham]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the very important Government works at Devonport\r\nand Keyham dockyards, there is a considerable amount of ship and\r\nboat-building, especially on the Dart and at Brixham, and the industry\r\nemploys altogether about 3500 men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15. Mines and Minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a time when mining, especially tin-mining, was the most\r\nimportant industry of Devonshire. Traces left all over Dartmoor show\r\nthat at a very early period tin was obtained there by the process called\r\n\"streaming,\" that is to say by the washing of grains of the metal out\r\nof the disintegrated and crumbling granite. Vast numbers of abandoned\r\nshafts sunk in search of tin, copper, iron, manganese, and even silver,\r\nremain, together with their too often ugly buildings, as evidence of\r\nthe former magnitude of the industry. At the present day, however, only\r\ntwenty-four mines are in active operation, providing employment for no\r\nmore than 700 men, who, in 1907, raised less than 1700 tons of metal of\r\nall descriptions.\r\n\r\nThe tin-miners of Devon and Cornwall were early formed into a corporate\r\nbody whose affairs were managed by a Stannary parliament that met on\r\nHingston Down. At a later period, probably at the beginning of the\r\nfourteenth century, the Devonshire men held their own parliament,\r\nwhich assembled on Crockern Tor. They were governed by a Warden--Sir\r\nWalter Ralegh held the office for some years--appointed by the Duchy\r\nof Cornwall, who collected the Duchy dues or royalties, and having\r\nascertained the purity of each block of tin by \"coinage,\" that is, by\r\ncutting off for analysis a \"coin\" or corner, stamped it with the Duchy\r\narms. A miner convicted of selling impure tin was punished by having\r\nsome of the melted metal poured down his throat. Lydford, Tavistock,\r\nChagford, and Ashburton were called Stannary Towns, since at each of\r\nthose places blocks of tin might be tested; and the arbitrary nature of\r\nthe Stannary Court is hinted at in the proverbial expression: \"Lydford\r\nLaw; hang first and try afterwards.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief mining district of Devonshire begins at the Tamar and extends\r\nacross Dartmoor and along its borders. The most important centre was\r\nTavistock, but there were rich mines at North Molton, where several\r\nkinds of metal were worked, near Ashburton, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe principal ores are those of copper and tin; some iron is worked, and\r\nthere are rich veins, believed to be not yet exhausted although not now\r\nworked, of galena or silver-lead.\r\n\r\nThe Devonshire mines formerly produced more tin than those of\r\nCornwall; but since the fourteenth century the output of the latter\r\ncounty has been the greater. The quantity now raised in Devonshire\r\nis inconsiderable, and in 1907 amounted to only 94 tons. Tin is very\r\nlargely used in making what is called tin-plate, which is really\r\nsheet-iron dipped into the melted metal. It is also mixed with copper to\r\nmake bronze or machine-brass, and it was for the manufacture of bronze\r\nthat it was so much sought after by the ancient inhabitants of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nCopper-mining in Devonshire is believed to be a comparatively modern\r\nindustry. It is not known whether the ancient Britons made their own\r\nbronze from native tin and copper, or whether they imported it from\r\nabroad. The Devon Great Consols Mine, four miles from Tavistock, once\r\nby far the richest mine in England, and one of the richest in the\r\nworld, has shipped as much as 1200 tons of copper in a single month,\r\nand has produced altogether 3-1/2 million pounds' worth of ore; but it\r\nnow yields little but arsenic. In 1907 only 652 tons were raised in the\r\nwhole county. The ore is not exhausted, but the cost of raising it from\r\ndeep mines is too great to withstand foreign competition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Devon Great Consols Mine]\r\n\r\nOres of iron and zinc are widely distributed, but are little worked; and\r\nthe annual yield, both of these metals and of manganese, of which this\r\ncounty was once a chief source of supply, is inconsiderable. Very rich\r\nsilver-lead ore was formerly worked at Bere Alston and at Combe Martin,\r\nbut the mines in both places have been abandoned. A very massive cup,\r\nmade of Combe Martin silver, given to the Corporation of London by\r\nQueen Elizabeth, is still used at the inauguration of each Lord Mayor.\r\nArsenic and arsenical pyrites, ochre, and umber are obtained, especially\r\nfrom some mines whose more valuable ore is exhausted. Cobalt, tungsten,\r\nand uranium also occur, and gold has been found in small quantities,\r\ngenerally in streams, as, for instance, in the West Webburn and below\r\nLethitor.\r\n\r\nAlthough the metal mines of Devonshire have lost their old importance,\r\nthere are other minerals of great commercial value, of which altogether\r\nmore than a million tons are obtained in the course of a year. China\r\nclay, or kaolin, a product of the natural decomposition of granite,\r\nis worked at Lee Moor, and more than 75,000 tons--which, however, is\r\nonly one-tenth of that obtained from Cornwall--are annually exported,\r\nespecially to Staffordshire, for the making of fine earthenware. Other\r\nkinds of potter's clay, white at Kingsteignton and Bovey Tracy, and red\r\nat Watcombe, are dug in still larger quantities.\r\n\r\nThere are many quarries in Devonshire, the most important of them being\r\nof limestone, of which more than half a million tons are worked every\r\nyear. Heytor granite was used in London Bridge and Waterloo Bridge, and\r\nLundy granite in the Thames Embankment. But the stone is not considered\r\nequal to that from Cornwall. The same remark applies to the slate, of\r\nwhich only 5000 tons are now raised annually. There are old quarries of\r\nit near Kingsbridge, and also at Tavistock and other places. Colyton\r\nslate is used for billiard-tables. Marble is worked at Chudleigh, and\r\na finer quality at Ipplepen, Torquay, and Plymouth. There are large\r\nquarries at Beer. The material for whetstones has long been dug in the\r\nBlackdown Hills, where the refuse from the workings, like lines of\r\nrailway embankment, is a feature in the landscape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stone Quarry, Beer]\r\n\r\nThere is no coal in Devonshire, but there is much lignite at Bovey\r\nTracy, where, in the bed of an ancient lake, a deposit of layers of\r\nit occurs, alternating with clay and sand, to a depth of 100 feet.\r\nOn account of its disagreeable smell while burning and its low\r\nheating-power it is not used for fuel except for firing bricks, and\r\nto some extent in the pottery-kilns. There are also extensive beds of\r\nanthracite or culm near Bideford; but this, again, is not of a quality\r\nto serve as fuel, except for lime-burning, and the product of the one\r\nsolitary working is ground up to make a paint called Bideford Black.\r\nThere are vast and valuable deposits of peat on Dartmoor, in some places\r\nas much as thirty feet deep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16. Fisheries and Fishing Stations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fisheries of the British Islands form one of our most important\r\nindustries, providing regular or occasional employment for nearly\r\n100,000 men and boys in the catching of the fish; for a very great\r\nnumber of persons engaged in secondary occupations connected with the\r\nindustry, who probably far outnumber the actual fishermen; and for\r\ninnumerable people of all grades engaged in distributing the eight\r\nmillion pounds' worth of fish brought into the ports of England and\r\nWales each year by British ships alone. The fisheries also furnish an\r\nimmense quantity of cheap and wholesome food, which, by rapid methods of\r\ntransit, is available in all parts of the country.\r\n\r\nBy far the most productive of our fishing-grounds, although not as\r\npredominant as it was some years ago, is the North Sea--an area of more\r\nthan 150,000 square miles, in which are taken more than half of all\r\nthe British-caught fish, not including shell-fish, which are annually\r\nlanded on the coasts of England and Wales. More fish are brought, every\r\nyear, into Grimsby, Hull, Lowestoft, and Yarmouth than into all the\r\nother fishing-ports of England put together. It is interesting to note\r\nthat, while according to the latest returns there were 1731 British\r\nsteam-trawlers and drifters, exclusive of ordinary fishing-boats,\r\nengaged in the North Sea fisheries, there were only 451 similar craft\r\nbelonging to the ports of Germany, Holland, Belgium, and France put\r\ntogether. In other words there are four British steam-trawlers in the\r\nNorth Sea to every foreigner. Much fishing is also done by English\r\ntrawlers off the shores of Iceland, Norway, and the Faroës, and the\r\nboats now go as far even as the White Sea and the coast of Morocco.\r\n\r\nAbout half the fish are taken by trawling, which consists in dragging a\r\nbeam of wood, with a net attached to it, along the bottom of the sea,\r\nin comparatively shallow water. Very many different species are caught\r\nin this way, but haddock, plaice, and cod are by far the most numerous,\r\nand make up between them nearly half the total amount of all the fish\r\nlanded in England and Wales in a year. Much fishing is also done with\r\nseine nets, or with drift nets, both of which are long nets, attached\r\nto floats of cork or to air-bladders and let down into the sea without\r\nregard to the depth, and sometimes at a considerable distance from the\r\nshore. Stake nets, fastened to poles fixed in shallow water near the\r\nland, are also much used. Herrings are the chief fish caught in drift\r\nnets and seines, and more of them are landed than of any other kind of\r\nfish. The latest return gives the total quantity of herrings annually\r\nbrought into English ports as rather more than 200,000 tons, of cod as\r\nabout 100,000 tons, and of plaice as about 50,000 tons. Pilchards, which\r\nare full-grown sardines, and much resemble herrings in appearance, are\r\ncaught in large quantities--which, however, seem trifling in comparison\r\nwith those of the three fish named above--in seine nets off the coasts\r\nof Cornwall and Devon, and nowhere else in the British Isles. Many\r\nfish, especially halibut, cod, and ling are taken with hook and line,\r\nsometimes at great depths. Crabs and lobsters are caught in wicker traps\r\nor baskets called pots, and oysters are usually taken by dredging.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fish Market at Brixham]\r\n\r\nIn spite of its two long stretches of seaboard, the fisheries of\r\nDevonshire are not equal in productiveness to those of Cornwall, and\r\nare insignificant in comparison with those of the east coast; and\r\nthe total value of the fish landed at all its ports taken together\r\namounted, according to the latest return, to no more than £150,000, or\r\none-nineteenth of what is landed at Grimsby alone. It was far exceeded\r\nat five other east-coast fishing stations.\r\n\r\nThe fish of the English Channel differ considerably from those of the\r\nNorth Sea. Haddock, the most abundant species on the east coast, is\r\nvery rare in the south, and practically none are caught at any of the\r\nDevonshire fishing stations. The cod, again, is a northern species,\r\nand is almost entirely absent from both the Bristol and the English\r\nChannels. Whiting is one of the most abundant of English Channel fish;\r\nand in this species, as well as in soles and turbot, the south coast\r\nis of all the British fishing-grounds second only in productiveness to\r\nthe east coast. More conger-eels are caught in the English Channel than\r\nanywhere else off our islands, and there is also a great abundance of\r\ngurnards, skates, and dogfish.\r\n\r\nThe Devonshire fishermen catch great quantities of whiting, herring,\r\nmackerel, sprats, and pilchards, together with considerable numbers of\r\nsoles, turbot, plaice, pollack, skates, congers, crabs, lobsters, and\r\nprawns. Herrings were formerly very abundant off Lynmouth. The last\r\ngreat shoals appeared in 1823. A skate caught off the south coast of\r\nDevonshire measured nine feet by six and a half feet, and weighed 560\r\npounds. The quantity of sprats annually caught in Devonshire waters is\r\nvery great, but, as in other districts, varies very much in different\r\nyears. Thus the amount brought into Torquay in 1905 was more than 500\r\ntons, or more than were landed at any other port in the kingdom; but in\r\n1906 the quantity was only 100 tons. Pilchards, as has been already\r\nobserved, are confined to Cornwall and to the south coast of Devon; but\r\nby far the greater quantity are taken at the fishing stations of the\r\nformer county. Almost all the pilchards caught in Devonshire waters are\r\nlanded at Plymouth. None are taken further east than Dawlish. These\r\nfish, which are particularly oily, are mostly salted and exported to the\r\nMediterranean. Dogfish, which are very abundant and formerly thrown away\r\nas worthless, are finding an increasing market, especially in London,\r\nwhere they are filleted and sold as \"flake.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Brixham Trawlers]\r\n\r\nThe most important fishing stations are Plymouth, Brixham, and Torquay,\r\nthe annual value of whose fisheries according to the latest return is\r\nabout £66,000, £60,000 and £8,000 respectively. There is also a good\r\ndeal of fishing off Exmouth, Teignmouth, Dartmouth, Torcross, and\r\nBudleigh Salterton, where the annual values vary from £4000 to £750 a\r\nyear. It is interesting to compare these figures with the annual value\r\nof the fish brought into Grimsby, which, by the last return, amounted to\r\nnearly three millions sterling.\r\n\r\nThere are valuable salmon fisheries at Exmouth, Teignmouth, and\r\nBabbacombe; and most of the Devonshire streams abound with trout,\r\nalthough the fish as a rule run small. Thirteen Devonshire fisheries are\r\nnamed in Domesday Book. The most valuable was that at Dartington, for\r\nwhich two fishermen paid a yearly rent of eighty salmon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17. Shipping and Trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ports of Devonshire once ranked among the first in England,\r\nand her sailors have for many centuries been famous for their\r\nenterprise and daring. It was from this county that the first English\r\ntrading-expeditions sailed to Africa, Brazil, and North America.\r\nThey were Devonshire men, who, by taking possession of Newfoundland,\r\nestablished the first English colony--in which most of the old families\r\nare of Devonshire descent. Devonshire ships were long the terror of the\r\nSpanish Main. Devonshire men were among the very foremost in the defeat\r\nof the Spanish Armada. A Devonshire captain was the first Englishman\r\nto sail round the world; and although we remember with regret that his\r\nfriend and comrade was the first Englishman to engage in the iniquitous\r\ntraffic of the slave-trade, we are proud to think that few men did more\r\nthan he to improve our ships and the condition of our seamen.\r\n\r\nIn their palmy days, in the century or more following the flight of the\r\nArmada, Bideford and Topsham had each of them more trade with the young\r\ncolonies of North America than any other English town except London.\r\nBarnstaple, Ilfracombe, Dartmouth, Brixham, and Appledore were once\r\nimportant seaports. At the present day not one of the whole seven has\r\nsufficient trade to be honoured with a separate entry in the Government\r\nShipping Returns. Plymouth is now the only maritime town of commercial\r\nimportance. Even its traffic, large as it seems, is small in comparison\r\nwith that of London or Liverpool, and as far as trading statistics go,\r\nit stands no higher than thirtieth among the ports of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nSeveral causes have contributed to the decay of the Devonshire ports.\r\nMost of them are situated on river-estuaries which, in the lapse of\r\nages, have become silted up by mud and sand brought down by the rivers,\r\nor obstructed by shingle washed up by the waves. The harbour of Sidmouth\r\nwas destroyed by the encroachment of the sea and the fall of the\r\ncliffs which formerly protected it. Again, the tonnage of ships, and\r\nconsequently the amount of water they draw, have very greatly increased\r\nsince Tudor and Stuart times, when these ports were in their prime; and\r\nit would be impossible for the large vessels of to-day to navigate the\r\nshallow and danger-strewn waters of our estuaries, even if they could\r\ncross the bars by which they are obstructed. Nor is it worth while to\r\nimprove the navigation by dredging, as is done to so great an extent\r\non the Thames, the Mersey, and the Clyde. The industries of Devonshire\r\nare now of small importance, and the county has no great manufacturing\r\ncentres to supply freights. Plymouth Sound is the only busy waterway,\r\nand Plymouth is the one populous town requiring large quantities of\r\nimports.\r\n\r\nThe only harbour in North Devon given in the shipping returns is\r\nBarnstaple, with which are associated Ilfracombe, Bideford, and\r\nAppledore. Ilfracombe, the only port in the long stretch of coast\r\nbetween Bridgwater and Padstow, had formerly a good deal of traffic\r\nwith Wales and Ireland, but its tidal harbour is now visited only by\r\nexcursion steamers and small coasting-vessels.\r\n\r\nThe other three towns are river-ports. Barnstaple is eight miles from\r\nthe mouth of the Torridge, Appledore is just inside the entrance of the\r\nTaw, and Bideford is five miles up the same river, whose estuary is\r\nobstructed by a dangerous bar, only to be crossed at high tide. In the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries all three towns had an active trade\r\nwith North America; and even in comparatively recent times ships of 1000\r\ntons have been moored at Barnstaple quay. But at the present day only\r\n37 cargo-carrying vessels sail to and from the whole group in a year,\r\nand the trade (chiefly in timber and dye-stuffs) of all four together,\r\nprincipally with home ports, but also with Sweden and Norway and some\r\nother European countries, amounts to little more than £18,000 in twelve\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nDartmouth, Brixham, and Salcombe form another group of ports, all of\r\nwhich have played a part in history. Their total trade, the import of\r\ntimber and the export of ships and boats, amounts to nearly £19,000 a\r\nyear, and such foreign intercourse as they have is chiefly with Sweden,\r\nNorway, and Russia.\r\n\r\nExeter and Exmouth, with which is associated Lyme Regis in the adjoining\r\ncounty of Dorsetshire, rank next in importance, Topsham, the ancient\r\nport of Exeter, having gone entirely to decay. Their annual trade, about\r\nhalf of which consists of wood, cured fish, and sugar, and which, as\r\nregards foreign intercourse, is mainly with France, Germany, and Sweden,\r\nis nearly £100,000.\r\n\r\nThe trade of Teignmouth and Torquay together, in the importation of\r\npaper-making materials and timber, and in the export of China-clay,\r\nchiefly with English ports, but also with France, Germany, Belgium, and\r\nNorway, amounts to £110,000 in the twelve-month.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Teignmouth]\r\n\r\nPlymouth which, as has been already pointed out, is the only large\r\nsea-port in the county, has four times as much trade, and is entered\r\nand cleared by four times as many vessels as all the other ports of\r\nDevonshire put together. Its chief imports are grain (£540,000),\r\ntimber (£250,000), sugar (£135,000), guano and manures (£110,000), and\r\npetroleum (£52,000); and its principal export is £52,000 worth of clay.\r\nIts imports and exports taken together amount to 1-3/4 million pounds\r\nsterling, and it is entered and cleared by 1656 ships in a year. Its\r\nchief foreign trade is with France, but its commerce may truly be\r\nsaid to be world-wide. Thirteen lines of ocean steamers sail from or\r\ncall at Plymouth, the principal of which are the White Star, American,\r\nNorddeutscher-Lloyd, and Hamburg-American for the United States; the\r\nOrient and Peninsular and Oriental for Australia; the latter and the\r\nBritish India for India; the Shaw-Savill and New Zealand SS. Co. for New\r\nZealand; and the British and African for the West Coast of Africa. There\r\nare also regular sailings of steamers for France, Scotland, Ireland, the\r\nChannel Isles, and various home ports.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare this sea-traffic with that of London, which\r\nis entered and cleared by 18,491 cargo-carrying ships in the course of\r\ntwelve months, and has a total annual import and export trade of 333\r\nmillions of pounds sterling; which are respectively about 11 times, and\r\nabout 190 times as large as the corresponding figures for Plymouth.\r\n\r\nBut although Plymouth is a place of considerable maritime trade, a\r\nbusy fishing station and a port of call for ocean-going steamers, for\r\nwhose accommodation are provided spacious docks and ample quays, its\r\ngreatest importance and renown--remembering that we include with it its\r\nsister towns of Stonehouse and Devonport--rest upon its rank as a naval\r\nstation, as an arsenal which is second only to that of Woolwich, and as\r\na naval dockyard which is the largest in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe anchorage at the head of the Sound, once very much exposed and\r\ndangerous in southerly winds, is now protected by a stone breakwater\r\nnearly a mile long, designed to shelter ships of the Royal Navy. It\r\nwas commenced in 1812 by Rennie, continued by his son, modified in\r\nthe slope of its sides and improved in stability by violent storms,\r\nespecially in 1817, and completed in 1840.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Drake's Island from Mt. Edgcumbe, Plymouth]\r\n\r\nTaking all its various features into account, its commerce, its\r\npassenger traffic by means of ocean-liners and other steamers, its\r\nfisheries, its docks and dockyards, its barracks, its factories of\r\nmarine appliances, its arsenal, and lastly the vast number of ships\r\nof all sizes, belonging to the navy, to the mercantile marine, or to\r\nthe fishing-fleet, that are constantly leaving or entering the Sound,\r\nPlymouth is one of the most important sea-ports in the British Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18. History of Devonshire.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of our country begins with the Roman occupation. For\r\nalthough we have ample and striking traces, in the shape of earthworks\r\nand stone circles, tools and weapons, pottery and ornaments, of the\r\nsuccessive races of men who lived here before Julius Caesar set foot in\r\nBritain, those ancient and primitive people left no written records, not\r\nso much as an inscription on a single coin, and our knowledge of them is\r\nin the highest degree vague and uncertain.\r\n\r\nOf many parts of our island the Romans took complete possession,\r\nconstructing fortresses, making roads, establishing towns, building\r\nbaths and temples and luxuriously appointed villas, and scattering,\r\nwherever they went, the coins whose lettering and devices have revealed\r\nto us so much concerning the some time masters of the world. In\r\nSomerset, for example, to which the conquerors were attracted partly\r\nby the hot and health-restoring springs of Bath, and partly by the\r\nsilver-bearing lead mines of the Mendip Hills, the relics of their\r\noccupation have been found from one end of the county to the other.\r\n\r\nIn Devonshire, on the other hand, such relics are so few, and are\r\nconfined to so limited an area that we are driven to the conclusion\r\nthat, except as regards the city of Exeter, there was no definite Roman\r\noccupation at all. There is probably not one camp of Roman workmanship\r\nin the whole county. It is doubtful if any Roman road went farther than\r\nthe river Teign. The sites of only two Roman villas are known with\r\ncertainty. And although Roman coins have been found in many places,\r\nsometimes in hoards of hundreds, and in one case even of thousands,\r\nthey are not absolute proof of actual occupation. The names Chester\r\nMoor, Scrobchester, and Wickchester, all near the Cornish border, may,\r\nperhaps, be of Roman origin.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, no doubt that Exeter, believed to be the _Isca\r\nDumniorum_ of Antonine's _Itinerary_--that wonderful register, planned\r\nby Julius Caesar and carried out by Augustus, of distances and stations\r\nalong all the roads in the Empire--was an important Roman town; and\r\nthere is reason to think, from the coins that have been found at many\r\npoints within the walls, that the city was held by the Romans from the\r\nlatter half of the first century of the Christian era until the time\r\nwhen the legions were recalled from Britain. The site of _Moridunum_,\r\nthe second Roman station mentioned in the _Itinerary_, has not been\r\nidentified, but there is some ground for the theory that it was at\r\nHembury, four miles from Honiton.\r\n\r\nA few vague and brief allusions in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, believed\r\nto refer to this county, describing how \"Ina fought against Geraint,\"\r\nhow \"Cynewulf fought very many battles against the Welsh,\" and how\r\n\"Egbert laid waste West Wales from eastward to westward,\" contain\r\npractically all that we know of the Saxon conquest of Devonshire. There\r\nis, indeed, so little record of actual fighting that it seems probable\r\nthat the invaders settled here rather as colonists than conquerors,\r\nalthough Athelstan appears to have found it necessary to expel from\r\nExeter the Britons who had so far shared the town with the Saxons.\r\n\r\nThe chief events in Devonshire between the departure of the Romans and\r\nthe Norman Conquest were the repeated descents, spread over a long\r\nperiod of years, of the pirates whom we speak of as Danes or Northmen\r\nor Vikings; who pillaged the coast towns, sacked Exeter, sailed up the\r\nTamar, and burnt and plundered Tavistock and Lydford. Victory was not\r\nalways on the side of the marauders. Their first raid, in 851, was\r\nrepulsed with great slaughter; and when, five and twenty years later,\r\nGuthrum seized Exeter, King Alfred promptly drove him out of it.\r\n\r\nDuring the Saxon period there were mints at Exeter, Barnstaple, Totnes,\r\nand Lydford, and thousands of Devonshire-struck silver pennies are in\r\nexistence. By far the greater number of them are in the royal museum at\r\nStockholm, the most numerous being those of Ethelred II and Canute. Of\r\nthe former there are in Stockholm 2254 specimens, compared with 144 in\r\nthe British Museum. These Swedish specimens probably represent partly\r\nthe plunder carried off by the Northmen, partly the bribes vainly paid\r\nto the invaders by Ethelred (whose surname of Unradig, \"he who will not\r\ntake counsel,\" or \"the headstrong,\" has been misrendered \"the Unready\"),\r\nand partly the results of commerce while Canute was king.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Penny of Ethelred II, struck at Exeter]\r\n\r\nThe year succeeding the Battle of Hastings found William the Conqueror\r\nbefore the gates of Exeter, a place already regarded, as it continued\r\nto be for many centuries, as the key of the West of England. He took\r\nthe city after a brief siege and proceeded to secure his hold upon it\r\nby building the castle of Rougemont, which was hardly finished when\r\nit was unsuccessfully attacked by the Saxons. A year later the sons\r\nof Harold also tried in vain to take it. The last man of mark in\r\nDevonshire to hold out against Norman rule was Sithric, the Saxon abbot\r\nof Tavistock, who, when all was lost, fled to Hereward's camp of refuge\r\nin the Fens. A few Englishmen were left by the Conqueror in possession\r\nof their estates; but the county, as a whole, was divided among a number\r\nof Norman nobles, some of whose descendants, Courtenay, Carew, and\r\nChampernowne, for example, still survive in Devonshire. An interesting\r\nlink with Norman times and customs is the ringing of the curfew bell,\r\nwhich is still kept up at Exeter, Okehampton, and other places. At eight\r\no'clock every evening thirty strokes are sounded for \"Curfew,\" and then\r\neight more for the hour.\r\n\r\nIn the stormy reign of King Stephen Exeter was the last place to hold\r\nout for Queen Maud. The king was admitted into the town by the citizens,\r\nbut the castle of Rougemont cost him a three months' siege.\r\n\r\nThe importance of Devonshire sea-ports brought the county into great\r\nprominence in mediaeval times. Part of Richard C[oe]ur-de-Lion's\r\ncrusading fleet, we are told, assembled at Dartmouth--a town which\r\nChaucer, probably regarding it as a typical sea-port, chose for the\r\nnative place of the Shipman in the _Canterbury Tales_. No other part\r\nof England furnished so many ships and men for Edward III's expedition\r\nagainst Calais. Again and again, in the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies, the French, in reprisal for what they had suffered by the\r\nattacks of England, harried the coast of Devon, plundering and burning\r\nTeignmouth, Plymouth, and other places on the coast.\r\n\r\nThe Black Death, the most terrible and destructive epidemic of which we\r\nhave any record, which devastated the whole of England in 1348 and 1349,\r\nwas very severe in this county, paralyzing agriculture and trade, and\r\nstopping for a time the building of Exeter cathedral.\r\n\r\nFighting in Devonshire during the Wars of the Roses was confined to an\r\nunsuccessful and half-hearted siege of Exeter by the Yorkists, and to\r\nattacks on the fortified manor-houses of Shute and Upcott. But many\r\nmen in the county took sides in the struggle, and some of the great\r\nfamilies suffered severely. Sir William Bonville was beheaded after the\r\nsecond Battle of St Albans. Of the ancient house of Courtenay, Thomas,\r\nEarl of Devon, was executed at York, Sir Hugh was beheaded at Sarum,\r\nand Sir John was killed at Wakefield Green. The county as a whole was\r\nLancastrian. Queen Margaret herself was there after her defeat at\r\nBarnet; and French gold coins found in Blackpool sands are believed to\r\nbe relics of the landing there, in 1470, of Warwick and Clarence. But\r\nwhen in the same year Edward IV visited Exeter, he was so well satisfied\r\nwith his reception that he presented the corporation with a sword of\r\nstate, which is still carried in processions before the mayor.\r\n\r\nThe peace of Devonshire in the fifteenth century was further disturbed\r\nby a rising, in 1483, against Richard III; by the march through the\r\ncounty, in 1497, of an army of Cornishmen who had risen in revolt\r\nagainst a heavy war-tax, and who were ultimately beaten at Blackheath;\r\nand by the insurrection, also in 1497, of Perkin Warbeck, who claimed\r\nto be the Richard Duke of York usually said to have been murdered in\r\nthe Tower, and who made a desperate although vain attack upon Exeter,\r\nwhen some of his men fought their way into the town, but were driven out\r\nagain by the citizens.\r\n\r\nAbout fifty years later, in 1549, there was a widespread and determined\r\nand altogether much more serious rebellion called the \"Commotion,\"\r\ncaused partly by the suppression of the Monasteries, which was greatly\r\nobjected to by the poor, and partly by the introduction of the Prayer\r\nBook. The insurgents, who had collected from all parts of the West\r\nCountry, and who were led by such men of mark as Pomeroy, Arundel, and\r\nCoffin, laid siege to Exeter and Plymouth, and for a time held the\r\nking's troops helplessly at bay. In the end, however, Lord Russell,\r\none of the newly-created Lords Lieutenant, aided by German cavalry and\r\nItalian arquebusiers, defeated the rebels with great slaughter in a\r\nseries of hotly-contested battles. The vicar of St Thomas in Exeter, who\r\nhad encouraged the rising and who was described as very skilled both\r\nwith the long-bow and the hand-gun, was hanged \"in his Popish apparel\"\r\non the tower of his own church, and his body was left there for four\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Queen Elizabeth has been called the Golden Age of English\r\nHistory. And among the heroic figures of that stirring time there are\r\nfew more striking than the little group of Devonshire men who played so\r\ngallant a part in making England great:--Drake and Hawkyns, the scourges\r\nof Spain; Ralegh, courtier and soldier, sailor and author; Gilbert,\r\nthe discoverer of Newfoundland; and Grenville, who at Flores, in the\r\n_Revenge_ of immortal memory, kept at bay a Spanish fleet of fifty-three\r\nsail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Signatures of Drake and Hawkyns]\r\n\r\nThe great event of the reign was the defeat of the Armada. And although\r\nHoward of Effingham, the Lord High Admiral, showed himself a skilful and\r\nintrepid sailor, it is Drake whom we always think of first in connection\r\nwith the victory. It was Drake whose buccaneering exploits on the\r\ncoasts of Spain and her colonies did so much to heighten Philip II's\r\nambition to humiliate England. It was Drake who, in 1587, dashed into\r\nCadiz, where the Armada was preparing, and by destroying 100 ships and\r\nvast quantities of stores, delayed for a whole year the sailing of the\r\nexpedition. And when at last the Armada had been sighted, it was Drake\r\nwho, according to the commonly received tradition, thinking it wiser\r\nto wait until the enemy's fleet had passed Plymouth Sound, and so take\r\nthem in the rear, persuaded his fellow-captains to stay and finish that\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten game of bowls, before the English ships, lying\r\nready in the Catwater, should slip their moorings and stand out to sea.\r\nIt was Drake who was foremost in the attack. It was Drake who took the\r\n_Capitana_, the flagship of Pedro de Valdez, and brought her, the first\r\nprize of the great victory, into Torbay. And when the English fireships\r\nhad scattered the hostile fleet in headlong flight, it was Drake who was\r\nforemost in the chase.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flagon taken by Drake from the \"Capitana\" of the Armada\r\n(_In Windsor Castle_)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Drake's Drum]\r\n\r\nAmong the relics of Devonshire's greatest hero, carefully treasured\r\nby his descendants at his old home at Buckland Abbey, are his sword\r\nand the famous drum that he carried with him round the world; while at\r\nNutwell Court are flags that he flew while in command of the _Pelican_,\r\nthe miniature of herself given to him by Queen Elizabeth, and other\r\nobjects of the greatest historical interest. And among the Royal plate\r\nin Windsor Castle is preserved the noble wine-flagon of bold silver-gilt\r\n_repoussé_ work, standing nearly a yard high, which Drake took from\r\nthe _Capitana_ of the Armada and presented to Queen Elizabeth. An\r\nillustration of it, from a photograph taken for this book by command of\r\nthe Queen, is here shown for the first time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The \"Mayflower\" Stone on Plymouth Quay]\r\n\r\nDuring the retreat to Spain a second Armada vessel, the hospital-ship\r\n_St Peter the Great_, was driven ashore in Hope Cove; and the pulpit\r\nof St James's church, Exeter, and the timber roof of Tiverton School\r\nwere, it is believed, made of wood either from this ship or from the\r\n_Capitana_.\r\n\r\nIt was not until this period that Plymouth came into prominence as a\r\nnaval station. A special tax was levied on the pilchard fishery to\r\nprovide money for the fortifications, and a leat or water-course was\r\nconstructed with the primary object, it is said, of supplying fresh\r\nwater for the royal ships.\r\n\r\nA memorable event in James I's reign was the sailing of the _Mayflower_.\r\nPreceded by another ship called the _Speedwell_ she set sail from Leyden\r\nin the autumn of 1620, having on board a number of Puritan refugees\r\nbent on finding in North America the religious freedom denied to them\r\nin England. The two vessels having met at Southampton and put into\r\nDartmouth, were finally driven back by stress of weather into Plymouth,\r\nwhence--her consort having proved unseaworthy--the _Mayflower_ alone\r\ncontinued the voyage, ultimately landing her 101 exiles at Plymouth,\r\nMassachusetts, which, however, had received its name five years before.\r\n\r\nIn the Civil War between Charles I and the Parliament, few counties saw\r\nmore fighting than Devonshire. The fighting consisted, however, not\r\nof pitched battles, but of sieges and attacks on fortified positions;\r\nwhich, indeed, was characteristic of the whole war, in whatever part of\r\nthe country it was waged. Every Devonshire town of importance, a great\r\nnumber of villages, many castles, manor-houses, and even churches played\r\na part in the struggle.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, the towns, with the exception of Exeter, sympathised with\r\nthe Parliament, while the rural districts, encouraged by the great\r\nlandowners, were mainly for the king. The royal forces were, however,\r\nnumerous in Devonshire; Goring's army, in 1642, was 6000 strong; and\r\nalthough fortune wavered, and although towns were taken and retaken,\r\nthere came a time, before the arrival of Fairfax and the New Model Army,\r\nwhen the royal standard flew from nearly every important town in Devon,\r\nSomerset, and Cornwall. There was one conspicuous exception. The party\r\nof the people never lost its hold on Plymouth, which, at a cost of 8000\r\nlives, or more than the entire population of the town, withstood a\r\nblockade lasting from 1642 to 1646, together with many desperate attacks\r\nby Hopton, Prince Maurice, and the King himself, enduring altogether a\r\nlonger siege than any other town in England.\r\n\r\nExeter was early seized for the Parliament, but the majority of the\r\ncitizens were Royalists, and the city, which was regarded as one of\r\nthe strongest Cavalier holds in the west, was soon retaken by Prince\r\nMaurice. Queen Henrietta was there in 1644, and there King Charles's\r\nyoungest daughter, afterwards Duchess of Orleans, was born. When Fairfax\r\nretook the town in 1646 he allowed the garrison to march out with all\r\nthe honours of war.\r\n\r\nThat year saw the final ruin of the Royal cause in the west, and the\r\ndispersal of the only army which, although little better than a mob,\r\nstill kept the field for the King.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important, and at the same time most fiercely-contested\r\nParliamentary victories, was the storming of the town of Torrington\r\nby Fairfax, at midnight, in the winter of 1646. After the battle, the\r\nchurch, which had been used by the king's troops (as also was Exeter\r\ncathedral) as a powder-magazine, was blown up, and 200 Royalist\r\nprisoners who had been confined in it and many of their guards were\r\nkilled. The loss of Torrington was the death-blow of the Royal cause in\r\nDevon. All that a brave man could do, Hopton did. But the county was\r\nsick of the Royalists and their methods. The people had learnt that\r\nthe well-disciplined troops of Fairfax were not mere robbers, like the\r\nruffians of Grenville and Goring; and after Torrington the Royal army\r\nmelted away.\r\n\r\nThe last place in the county to hold out for the King except Lundy,\r\nwhere there was no fighting, but which did not surrender until 1647,\r\nwas Clifton Castle, or Fort Charles, near Salcombe. After enduring a\r\nblockade and siege of four months, with the trifling loss of one man\r\nkilled and one wounded, the besieged were granted the same terms as\r\nthe garrisons of Exeter and Barnstaple, and marched out with matches\r\nlighted, drums beating, and colours flying.\r\n\r\nAfter the Battle of Worcester, in 1651, Charles II took refuge for\r\na time in Devonshire. Four years later there was an attempt at an\r\ninsurrection in his favour, known as Penruddock's Rising, and Charles\r\nwas proclaimed King at South Molton. The movement was promptly\r\nsuppressed, and its leader, Colonel Penruddock, was executed. It is\r\ninteresting to remember that, at the Restoration in 1660, Exeter was the\r\nfirst town in England to acknowledge Charles II, and that he was there\r\nproclaimed King ten days before he landed at Dover. Seven years later,\r\nin 1667, the great Dutch Admiral De Ruyter captured all the shipping in\r\nTorbay.\r\n\r\nDuring the Commonwealth and later, when there was no copper coinage in\r\nthis country, many tradesmen all over England struck money of their own,\r\nchiefly in the form of farthings. Nearly 400 varieties of Devonshire\r\n\"tokens,\" as they were called, issued by sixty different towns, are\r\nknown. Ninety-one were struck at Exeter alone, which is more than were\r\nissued from any other provincial town except Norwich. At a much later\r\nperiod shillings and sixpenny tokens of leather were in circulation at\r\nHartland.\r\n\r\nAfter the Duke of Monmouth landed at Lyme in Dorsetshire, in 1685,\r\nAxminster was the first town that he occupied, and a number of Colyton\r\nmen are said to have joined his army. Otherwise the rebellion hardly\r\ntouched Devonshire. Yet Judge Jeffreys put to death, at various places\r\nin the county, thirty-seven of the Duke's misguided followers. After the\r\nBattle of Sedgemoor, Wade and other fugitives attempted to escape by sea\r\nfrom Ilfracombe, but they were obliged to put back, and were caught in\r\nthe woods near Lynton.\r\n\r\nWhen, under very different auspices, William of Orange landed at Brixham\r\non the 5th of November, 1688, he marched to Exeter, as the chief city of\r\nthe west. The citizens at first held aloof, but in the end they gave to\r\nthe Deliverer their hearty and most valuable support.\r\n\r\nTwo years later the French admiral Tourville, fresh from his victory\r\nover our fleet off Beachy Head, landed a strong force at Teignmouth, and\r\nsacked and burnt that part of the town which ever since has been known\r\nas French Street.\r\n\r\nBoth in 1715 and in 1745 the county was suspected of showing sympathy\r\nwith the exiled Stuarts. But when in the former year the Duke of Ormond,\r\nwith a small party of French soldiers, appeared in a war-ship off\r\nBrixham, expecting to be welcomed by the Devonshire Jacobites, he met\r\nwith no encouragement.\r\n\r\nSeveral episodes in the history of Devonshire are associated with the\r\nFrench war of the close of the eighteenth and the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth centuries. In 1797 a French squadron, afterwards captured\r\nby Admiral Bridport, sank the fishing-boats in Ilfracombe harbour. A\r\nfew years later, in 1809, Princetown was built for the reception of the\r\nrougher class of French prisoners of war, and during the five years that\r\nfollowed 12,679 Frenchmen and Americans were confined there, while many\r\nothers were billeted at Okehampton, Ashburton, Tavistock, and Moreton\r\nHampstead. The Princetown buildings were afterwards disused--except for\r\na short occupation by a naphtha company--until 1850, when they were\r\nconverted into a prison for convicts.\r\n\r\nIt was at this period that Torquay came into note, having become a place\r\nof residence for the families of naval officers serving on men-of-war\r\nanchored in Torbay. In Torbay, too, was enacted what may be called the\r\nlast scene of the war. For it was here, on the 24th of July, 1815, that\r\nNapoleon was brought a prisoner. And here he remained, except for a few\r\ndays spent in Plymouth Sound, until the 11th of August, when he was\r\ntaken to St Helena.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19. Antiquities.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the archaeologist and the antiquarian Devonshire is one of the most\r\ninteresting counties in England. With the exception of Cornwall no other\r\ndistrict is so rich in relics of the ancient inhabitants of Britain;\r\nand it was from the caves of this county that Pengelly obtained that\r\nclear evidence of the extreme antiquity of man in this island which\r\nproved that he lived here, unnumbered ages back, when such animals as\r\nthe cave-lion, the hyaena, and the mammoth ran wild in what we now call\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Palaeolithic Flint Implement\r\n(_From Kent's Cavern_)]\r\n\r\nThe people who inhabited Britain before the coming of the Romans are\r\nsaid to have belonged to the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, or the Iron Age,\r\naccording to the material which they used for their tools and weapons;\r\nand the first of these epochs is further divided into the Earlier and\r\nthe Later Stone Ages, or the Palaeolithic and the Neolithic Periods.\r\nThe implements of the former were very roughly fashioned of chipped,\r\nunpolished flint; those of the latter were more skilfully made, and were\r\nsometimes very highly finished.\r\n\r\nRelics of all these periods have been found in Devonshire, but it is not\r\nalways possible to say to which age a particular weapon or implement\r\nbelongs. The use of flint for arrow-heads, for example, certainly\r\ncontinued long after the invention of bronze; and bronze was employed,\r\nespecially for ornaments, long after iron had come into regular use.\r\n\r\nTraces of Palaeolithic man are nowhere common, and they are rare in\r\nDevonshire; but they have been found, in the shape of massive tools of\r\nroughly chipped flint, in Kent's Cavern near Torquay, in the Cattedown\r\nCave, now destroyed, near Plymouth, and in the river-drift near\r\nAxminster. Very fine examples have been obtained from a ballast-pit at\r\nBroome.\r\n\r\nRemains belonging to the Neolithic Age, on the other hand, are not only\r\nmuch more abundant, but are of greater variety, showing an advance in\r\nknowledge of the arts of life, and they include not only axe-heads,\r\nspear-points, and arrow-tips of flint, in some cases beautifully\r\nfinished, but weapons and ornaments of bone and horn, rude pottery,\r\nspindle-whorls, and even primitive musical instruments. No traces of\r\nthe dwellings of the people of this age, except as regards the caves\r\nthat sheltered some of them and their predecessors of the earlier time,\r\nhave yet been found, nor of their graves, if we except the Spinster's\r\nRock, two miles west of Drewsteignton. This is a dolmen consisting of\r\nthree huge stones, on which rests a still larger block, twelve feet long\r\nand estimated at sixteen tons in weight; it doubtless was a Neolithic\r\nburying-place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dolmen near Drewsteignton]\r\n\r\nRelics of the Bronze Age are far more abundant, and they form, indeed,\r\nthe chief archaeological feature of Devonshire. Dartmoor in particular,\r\nchiefly perhaps because its great upland wilderness has never been\r\nbroken up by the plough, is dotted all over with remains of primitive\r\nBronze Age dwellings, sometimes standing alone, sometimes grouped in\r\nvillages and surrounded by a wall, and also with many stone circles,\r\ntumuli, kistvaens, menhirs, and rows of upright stones. It is, moreover,\r\nintersected by a network of ancient trackways, linking settlement to\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Palstave of the Bronze Age\r\n(_In Exeter Museum_)]\r\n\r\nThe best example of an early Bronze Age village is Grimspound, eight\r\nmiles north-east of Princetown. It consists of twenty-four round huts\r\nmade of stone slabs set on end and standing about three feet above\r\nground, scattered over a space of about four acres, surrounded by a\r\nnearly circular double wall, from nine to fourteen feet thick, and about\r\nfive feet high, built of blocks of granite, some of which are tons in\r\nweight. Half the huts contain fire-hearths, which have been much used;\r\nand a good many have raised stone benches, from eight inches to a foot\r\nhigh. Except that the roofs, which were no doubt made of poles and\r\nthatch, have disappeared, these primitive dwellings, of which there are\r\nhundreds on Dartmoor, are probably much in the same condition as when\r\nthey were inhabited, perhaps 2000 years ago. It has been suggested that\r\nGrimspound, like many ancient camps or hill-forts, was a place of refuge\r\nin times of danger, rather than a permanently occupied fortress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fernworthy Circle, near Chagford]\r\n\r\nThe objects found in these and similar dwellings consist of flint\r\nimplements, pottery--some of it decorated--spindle-whorls, and\r\ncooking-stones such as are still in use among the Eskimo. So far, no\r\nfragment of metal of any kind has been discovered, from which it might,\r\nperhaps, have been inferred that the huts were the work of a race\r\nunacquainted with the use of metal. But the pottery so closely resembles\r\nthat found in the burial-mounds of the Bronze Age that archaeologists\r\nare satisfied that the dwellings belong to that period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hurston Stone Alignment]\r\n\r\nOther remarkable monuments are the stone circles, or upright, unhewn\r\nblocks of granite arranged in rings, of which there are many on\r\nDartmoor, and of which some of the finest are the Grey Wethers near Post\r\nBridge, and similar structures near Chagford and on Langstone Moor; the\r\navenues or alignments, consisting of rows of stones set up in straight\r\nlines, as at Merivale Bridge, Hurston, and Challacombe; and the menhirs,\r\nwhich are single stones, sometimes twelve feet high, of which the best\r\nare at Drizlecombe, at Merivale, and on Langstone Moor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Triple Stone Row and Circle near Headlands, Dartmoor]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that these structures were connected with primitive forms\r\nof worship, but Sir Norman Lockyer has endeavoured to show, in one of\r\nthe most fascinating chapters of archaeological research, that the\r\ncircles and avenues, and the monoliths or menhirs connected with them,\r\nwere in all probability set up as rough astronomical instruments for\r\nobserving the rising of the sun or of particular stars, in order to\r\nregulate the true length of the year. It is even possible, he contends,\r\nto form some idea of the date of their erection. Thus the two avenues\r\nat Merivale were probably laid out at different times, one about 1610\r\nB.C., and the other about 1420 B.C., in order to watch the\r\nsunrise in May, which was then regarded as the first month of the year;\r\nwhile the avenues at Challacombe, among the most remarkable of all the\r\nmonuments, are probably of far older date, perhaps 3500 B.C., and seem\r\nto have been arranged for the observation of sunrise in November, a month\r\nlong accepted by some Celtic tribes as marking the beginning of the year.\r\n\r\nKistvaens, of which nearly 100 have been found, almost all of them\r\non Dartmoor, are small stone burial chambers, generally used for the\r\nreception of the burnt ashes of the dead, probably in many instances\r\noriginally covered with earth, and made of four slabs of granite set on\r\nedge, forming a sort of vault, with another and more massive stone laid\r\non the top. Specially good examples have been found at Fernworthy, on\r\nLakehead Hill, and at Plymouth. The most remarkable kistvaen--belonging,\r\nhowever, to a later period, when burial had displaced cremation--was\r\nthat discovered on Lundy, containing a human skeleton eight feet two\r\ninches in length.\r\n\r\nTumuli or burial mounds, called cairns when they are made of small\r\nstones, and barrows when they are merely piles of earth, are to be seen\r\nin all parts of Devonshire, especially on high ground, sometimes alone,\r\nsometimes in groups of from two to ten or twelve, and always round. No\r\nlong barrows have been discovered in the county.\r\n\r\nThe men of the Bronze Age reached a much higher stage of civilisation\r\nthan their stone-using predecessors, and very fine examples of their\r\nbronze swords, daggers, spear-heads and axes; of their pottery, some of\r\nit finely decorated; and of their ornaments, including beads of shale\r\nand clay and amber, and an amber dagger-hilt with studs of gold, have\r\nbeen found at various places in Devonshire.\r\n\r\nRelics that can be attributed with certainty to the prehistoric Iron Age\r\nare rare, partly, no doubt, because iron so quickly rusts away. Some\r\nvery remarkable remains of this period were however found on Stamford\r\nHill near Plymouth, during the construction of a fort, when the workmen\r\ndug into an ancient burial-ground, in which, in addition to human bones,\r\nwere discovered red, black, and yellow pottery, mirrors and finger\r\nrings of bronze, fragments of beautiful amber-tinted glass, and some\r\nmuch-corroded cutting-instruments of iron. In the old camp called Holne\r\nChase Castle, a man digging out a rabbit came upon about a dozen bars\r\nof rusty iron, two feet long, nearly two inches broad, and a quarter of\r\nan inch thick, which although at first mistaken, as has been the case\r\nelsewhere, for unfinished sword-blades, were subsequently identified\r\nas specimens of the iron currency-bars which passed as money among the\r\nancient Britons. British coins of gold, silver, and copper have been\r\nfound in several places, particularly at Exeter and at Mount Batten near\r\nPlymouth. The commonest are of what is known as the Channel Islands\r\ntype, bearing the effigy of a horse rudely imitated from the Macedonian\r\nstater, and probably struck about 200 B.C.\r\n\r\nA special feature of the prehistoric antiquities of Devonshire is the\r\ngreat number of camps or hill-forts, of which there are more than 140;\r\nsome in the heart of the county, some on the coast, often on prominent\r\nheadlands, and some along the lines of division between this and the\r\nadjoining shires; showing in many instances great military skill and\r\nknowledge both in construction and in the choice of good, defensive\r\nsites. Two of the most remarkable of the many strongholds, both near\r\nHoniton, are the great encampment of Dumpdon and the magnificently\r\nplanned fortress of Hembury--a monument of military skill. Another fine\r\nexample is Hawkesdown, the strongest of the chain of border forts--of\r\nwhich Membury and Musbury are two important links--built along the\r\nriver Axe as defences against the ancient inhabitants of Dorsetshire.\r\nOne of the largest and most elaborate of all is Clovelly Dykes, twenty\r\nacres in extent, and defended by from three to five lines of intricate\r\nearthworks. Another remarkable fort, and the largest in the county, is\r\nMilber Down, two miles south-east of Newton Abbot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bronze Centaur forming the Head of a Roman Standard\r\n(Found at Sidmouth)]\r\n\r\nThere is no real clue to the makers of these fortresses. Roman coins\r\nhave been found in several of them, but there is not one which competent\r\nauthorities attribute to the Romans, and it is probable that they were\r\nbuilt by British tribes during the ages of Bronze and of Iron, but\r\nperhaps chiefly by the Gaels or Goidels. A few of them have played a\r\npart in modern history. Cadbury, for instance, was occupied by Fairfax\r\nin 1645; and in 1688 the Prince of Orange parked his artillery in the\r\ngreat fort of Milber Down, a camp which it is thought was not only\r\noccupied but adapted by the Romans.\r\n\r\nThe Romans, as was pointed out in the previous chapter, left\r\ncomparatively few traces in Devonshire; and at only twelve spots in the\r\ncounty have Roman relics other than coins been discovered. At Exeter,\r\nthe only town where there seems to have been continuous occupation,\r\nthere have been found the foundations of the city walls, a bath, several\r\ntesselated pavements--one of which has been relaid in the hall of the\r\npolice-court, on the spot where it was discovered--statuettes in bronze\r\nand in stone, engraved gems, lamps--one encrusted with lizards, toads,\r\nand newts--many pieces of finely decorated Samian pottery, and great\r\nnumbers of coins. The finest mosaic pavement was that found at Uplyme,\r\non the site of one of the only two known Roman villas in the county.\r\nCoins have been dug up in many places. Considerable hoards have been\r\ndiscovered at Compton Gifford, Holcombe, Tiverton, and Widworthy. The\r\nlargest, however, was at Kingskerswell, where 2000 were found together.\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable Roman relic was a bronze object found on\r\nthe beach at Sidmouth, believed to be the head of a standard, and\r\nrepresenting Chiron the Centaur carrying Achilles.\r\n\r\nExcept as regards coins, of which great numbers are in existence,\r\nespecially, as has been stated, in the Royal Museum at Stockholm, few\r\nantiquities that can be ascribed to the Saxons have been found in\r\nDevonshire. One remarkable relic, now in the British Museum, was a\r\nbronze sword-hilt, dug up in Exeter in 1833, finely ornamented with\r\nkey-pattern, and inscribed LEOFRIC·ME·FEC(IT). Part of the\r\nlettering is inverted, a fact which at first entirely disguised the\r\nreal words. One of the treasures of Exeter Cathedral is an Old English\r\nmanuscript headed \"A Mycel Englisc Bok,\" placed in the Chapter Library\r\nby Leofric, who in 1050 was bishop of the diocese. It contains some of\r\nthe work of Cynewulf and his school. One poem has been thus translated:\r\n\r\n    \"To the Frisian wife\r\n    comes a dear welcome guest;\r\n    the keel is at rest;\r\n    his vessel is come;\r\n    her husband is home;\r\n    her own cherished lord\r\n    she leads to the board;\r\n    his wet weeds she wrings;\r\n    dry garments she brings.\r\n    Ah, happy is he\r\n    whom, home from the sea\r\n    his true love awaits.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Saxon Sword-hilt]\r\n\r\nA Norman relic of the highest interest is the Exeter Domesday Book, also\r\npreserved in the Chapter Library, describing in greater detail than is\r\ngiven by the Winchester Survey, especially as regards live stock, the\r\nfive counties of Devon, Cornwall, Dorset, Somerset, and Wiltshire. Among\r\nmany points of difference between the two books is that where the more\r\ngeneral survey gives the letters T.R.E., for _tempore regis Edwardi_,\r\nmeaning that such were the facts in the time of Edward the Confessor,\r\nthe Exeter Book uses the phrase \"eadie q^a rex·E·f·u·&·m·\" for _eâ die\r\nqua Rex Edwardus fuit vivus et mortuus_, that is to say, \"on the day\r\nwhen King Edward was alive and dead,\" meaning the day he died, which was\r\nthe 6th of January, 1066. It is worthy of note that, with one exception,\r\nthe Devonshire Hundreds were the same in 1086, the supposed year of the\r\ncompletion of the Survey, as they are in our time.\r\n\r\nScattered up and down over Devonshire are many old stone crosses,\r\nsome in churchyards or by the wayside, probably intended as preaching\r\nplaces, and some standing on the open moor as marks of boundary or of\r\nlines of ancient roadway, a few of them bearing brief inscriptions or\r\ntraces of decoration. Fine examples are those of Addiscot, Helliton,\r\nMary Tavy, and South Zeal, the last-named of which has been restored,\r\nand measures, with its steps, eighteen feet in height; the Merchant's\r\nCross near Meavy, the tallest on Dartmoor; the very ancient Coplestone\r\nCross, once decorated with interlaced Celtic ornament, standing where\r\nthree parishes meet, and named in an Anglo-Saxon charter of 974; and the\r\nNun's or Siward's Cross, inscribed on one side (SI)WARD, and on\r\nthe other BOC LOND, set up in the twelfth century to mark the\r\nboundary between the royal forest and the property of Buckland Abbey.\r\n\r\nWith these may be mentioned the inscribed stones of Lustleigh, Stowford,\r\nTiverton, and Fardel--the latter now removed. The last-named, and one of\r\nthe three Tiverton examples, bear inscriptions in Ogham or Irish runic\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cyclopean Bridge, Dartmoor]\r\n\r\nAmong the features of Dartmoor are the so-called \"clapper bridges,\"\r\nmade of great blocks of unhewn stone. Their date and their builders\r\nare matters of conjecture. If, as has been said, they were meant for\r\npack-horse traffic, they may be at least as old as the time of the\r\nNorman Conquest, for packhorses are mentioned in the Exeter Domesday.\r\nThere are fine examples at Dartmeet, Bellaford, and near Scaurhill\r\nCircle. But the most striking and perhaps the most ancient is that at\r\nPost Bridge, in which two of the stones are fifteen feet long.\r\n\r\nThe idea has long been abandoned that Logan or rocking stones were the\r\nwork of man, or that the rock basins which are found on the top of some\r\nof the Dartmoor tors had anything to do with Druidical ceremonies. Both\r\nare now recognised as of natural origin. But it may here be noted that\r\nthe largest of the Devonshire Logans is the Rugglestone, at Widecombe,\r\nestimated at from 100 to 150 tons, but it can no longer be moved. The\r\nlargest that will still rock is one of about fifty tons weight at\r\nSmallacombe. The largest of the many rock basins, which vary from a few\r\ninches to five feet or more, are on Heltor and Kestor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20. Architecture--(_a_) Ecclesiastical.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical buildings of Devonshire,--its magnificent cathedral,\r\nwhich is without doubt the finest example of the Decorated style in all\r\nEngland; its many noble churches, some of which, specially remarkable\r\nfor their interest and beauty, are situated in remote and thinly-peopled\r\nrural parishes; and, in a minor degree, the picturesque fragments of\r\nits ruined abbeys--form altogether one of the most striking features\r\nof the county. Speaking generally, it may be said that Devonshire\r\nchurches, as a whole, are remarkable for their interiors, very many\r\nof them containing beautiful wood-work, especially rood-screens, and\r\nfinely-carved stone pulpits, to which, in many instances, the addition\r\nof gold and colour has lent a still more striking and even gorgeous\r\neffect. Some of the exteriors also are very beautiful; but, on the other\r\nhand, many of them, partly on account of the intractable nature of the\r\nstone of which they were built, are simple and even severe in character.\r\nAs might be expected, the material varies with the geological formation.\r\nThus, many churches were built of grey limestone. In East Devon much use\r\nwas made of flints and of freestone from Beer. Round Exeter and Crediton\r\nvolcanic tufa was often employed, particularly in vaulting. The use of\r\nOld Red Sandstone and even of granite greatly affected the style, which\r\nin buildings of those difficult materials is plain and with little\r\nornament.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of the churches of Devonshire were more or less\r\nrebuilt during the Perpendicular period, that is, between 1377 and\r\n1547; but many, probably even the majority of them, contain features of\r\nearlier dates, in a few cases going as far back as Saxon times. Some\r\nhave been skilfully restored. But in too many cases the work of renewal\r\nwas carried out in an age when church architecture was imperfectly\r\nunderstood, and when the value of old and beautiful, even if time-worn,\r\ndetails was not sufficiently appreciated; and it is unfortunately true\r\nthat, in order to accomplish needless or barbarous alterations, many\r\ninteresting features were ruthlessly swept away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Norman Doorway, Axminster Church]\r\n\r\nThe oldest existing work is the Saxon masonry in the bases of some of\r\nthe central Norman towers--those of Branscombe, Axminster, and Colyton,\r\nfor example, and in the crypt of Sidbury. No church is wholly or even\r\nlargely Norman; but the transeptal towers of Exeter Cathedral are of\r\nthis period, as are the towers of South Brent, Ilfracombe, and Aveton\r\nGifford, in addition to those named above. There are also fine Norman\r\ndoorways at Paignton, Kelly, Axminster, Hartland, Bishop's Teignton,\r\nand elsewhere. In at least a hundred churches, most of which probably\r\npossess no other feature of the time, there are Norman fonts, of which\r\nthe most remarkable are those at Hartland, Alphington, and Bradsworthy.\r\nThe font in Dolton church is believed to be Saxon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ottery St Mary Church]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best examples of Early English architecture are to be seen\r\nin the aisles and transeptal towers--the latter imitated from those\r\nof Exeter Cathedral--of the very beautiful church of Ottery St Mary,\r\nthe finest and most interesting church in Devon. The plain little\r\nbuilding on Brent Tor, one of the smallest of churches, measuring only\r\nforty feet by fourteen, is probably all Early English. The churches of\r\nSampford Peverell, Haccombe, and Aveton Gifford are almost entirely of\r\nthis period, as are the transepts and central tower of Combe Martin and\r\nthe tower of Buckfastleigh, which carries one of the few spires in the\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decorated Window, Exeter Cathedral]\r\n\r\nThe Decorated style is not so well represented as regards the number\r\nof examples. But to this period belongs almost the whole of Exeter\r\nCathedral, a great part of the beautiful church of Tavistock, and the\r\nnave, chancel, and Lady-chapel of Ottery St Mary. There is also good\r\nwork of this style at Beer Ferris, Plympton, and Denbury.\r\n\r\nSo many Devonshire churches, as already remarked, were rebuilt in\r\nTudor times that the majority of the ecclesiastical buildings in the\r\ncounty appear to belong to the Perpendicular period. There is very\r\nbeautiful Perpendicular work in the church of Tiverton, whose south\r\nfront and chapel were decorated by their founder, a wool-merchant named\r\nGreenway, with very elaborate carvings, some symbolic of his trade,\r\nand some representing scenes from the life of Christ. Other notable\r\nchurches mainly of this period--to name a few only out of a multitude\r\nof examples--are those of Crediton, Hartland, Plymptree, Awliscombe,\r\nKenton, Harberton, Dartmouth, and Buckland Monachorum.\r\n\r\nTo the Perpendicular period belong the finest of the Devonshire\r\ntowers, which as a rule, however, owing in many instances to the\r\nabsence or to the poorness of buttresses and pinnacles, lack the\r\nmajesty of those which are so striking a feature of the ecclesiastical\r\narchitecture of Somerset. There is a group of three towers in near\r\nneighbourhood, assigned by tradition to the same architect, and known\r\nas Length, Strength and Beauty, at Bishop's Nympton, South Molton, and\r\nChittlehampton, respectively; and the last of these, a magnificent piece\r\nof architecture, is the most beautiful specimen of an enriched tower in\r\nDevonshire. Other very fine towers are those of Cullompton, Chumleigh,\r\nBerrynarbor, Arlington, Kentisbury, and Combe Martin. The tower of\r\nColyton is unique in character, being crowned by an octagonal lantern\r\nsupported by slender flying buttresses. There are not now many spires\r\nin Devonshire, but there are fine examples at Modbury--which tapers the\r\nwhole way up--and at Barnstaple, both of the sixteenth century; and\r\nthere are others at Braunton, Brushford, and West Worlington. One of the\r\ntowers of Ottery St Mary carries a spire, the other is without.\r\n\r\nOne of the special characteristics of Devonshire churches is their\r\nwoodwork, their roofs and bench-ends, their pulpits--although some of\r\nthe best of these are of stone--and, above all, their rood-screens. The\r\nlast-named are among the finest in the kingdom, and are not rivalled\r\neven in Norfolk and Suffolk.\r\n\r\nThere are good timber roofs at Cullompton, Widecombe, South Tawton,\r\nHartland, Ashburton, Chittlehampton, Sampford Courtenay, and\r\nHatherleigh. The bench-ends at Abbotsham, Ilsington, Ashton, Mortehoe,\r\nTawstock, Braunton, Monksleigh, Frithelstock, East Budleigh, and\r\nCombe-in-Teignhead are specially fine. The seventeenth century seats at\r\nCruwys Morchard are inscribed with the farm names of the parish.\r\n\r\nRood-screens, which are here the most remarkable feature of the\r\nPerpendicular period, are very numerous in Devonshire. Although many\r\nhave disappeared, having been removed or broken up, there are still some\r\n150 in more or less perfect condition. So many of them, moreover, are\r\nof such truly exquisite workmanship that it is difficult to say which\r\nare the most beautiful. The material, in the majority of cases, is wood,\r\nperhaps because of the scarcity of tractable stone--elaborately carved,\r\nand very often splendidly decorated with gold and colour. There are,\r\nhowever, magnificent screens of stone in Exeter Cathedral and in the\r\nchurches of Totnes and Awliscombe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rood Screen and Pulpit, Harberton Church]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that most of the screens were the work of native\r\ncraftsmen, but there are some whose style shows distinct signs of\r\nforeign influence. The beautiful screen at Harberton, for example,\r\nsuggests Spanish work or influence, that of Colebrook French, that of\r\nKenton Flemish, and that of Swymbridge Italian. While by far the greater\r\nnumber are of the Perpendicular period, that of Washfield is Jacobean,\r\nand that of Cruwys Morchard is Georgian. It is perhaps generally\r\nconsidered that the magnificent screen at Kenton is the finest of all;\r\nbut it has a good many rivals which closely approach it in beauty of\r\ndesign and in excellence of workmanship. Other splendid specimens, all\r\nof them of great beauty, are those at Kentisbere, Hartland, Hemyock,\r\nSwymbridge, Kingsnympton, Dartmouth, Honiton, Holbeton, Tawstock,\r\nLustleigh, Lapford, Pinhoe, and Uffculme. The last-named, which measures\r\nsixty-seven feet, is the longest, and that at Welcombe is believed to be\r\nthe oldest, in the county.\r\n\r\nCarved pulpits are another special feature of Devonshire churches. The\r\nfinest stone pulpit, which is at Harberton, contains, like the beautiful\r\nexamples at South Molton and Chittlehampton, full-length figures in\r\npanels. Other good stone pulpits are at Pilton, Totnes, Paignton,\r\nDartmouth and elsewhere. Two particularly fine carved oaken pulpits\r\nare those of Hartland and Kenton, the latter of which is very richly\r\ndecorated with gold and colour. There are also good specimens at East\r\nAllington, Tor Bryan, Ipplepen, and Holne.\r\n\r\nAncient stained glass is very rare in Devon, much having been destroyed\r\nby Puritan fanatics. The best which has survived is at Doddiscombeleigh,\r\nwhere there are four very beautiful windows. There is also very good\r\nglass at Cheriton Bishop and Budleigh; and some less striking but\r\nnoteworthy examples may be seen at Ashton, Christow, Cadbury, Manaton,\r\nAtherington and other places. The great east window in Exeter Cathedral\r\ncontains some very fine coloured glass, and there are a few remains in\r\nsome of the clerestory windows.\r\n\r\nAmong the very striking recumbent effigies of warriors and churchmen\r\nand great ladies to be found in our churches there are some not to be\r\nsurpassed in England; and the magnificent examples in Exeter Cathedral,\r\nin particular, afford most valuable chronological studies both of\r\ncostume and of carving. Among the finest of those in the cathedral are\r\nthe splendid thirteenth century alabaster effigy of Bishop Bronescombe,\r\nthe fourteenth century mail-clad figures of Humphrey de Bohun and Sir\r\nRichard Stapledon, and the sixteenth century effigy of Bishop Hugh\r\nOldham. Perhaps the grandest of those in parish churches, to name a\r\nfew only out of many, are the fourteenth century effigies of Sir Otho\r\nGrandisson and his wife at Ottery St Mary, and the seventeenth century\r\nfigures of Denys Rolle and his wife at Bicton. Other fine effigies are\r\nat Paignton, Broadclyst, Landkey, Tawstock, Haccombe, and Horwood and\r\nthe Seymour tomb at Berry Pomeroy.\r\n\r\nOur county is rich also in monumental brasses, most of which date from\r\nthe fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Among the finest are the splendid\r\ntriple-canopied fifteenth century brasses in the church of St Saviour,\r\nDartmouth, in memory of Sir John Hawley and his two wives, the fifteenth\r\ncentury brass of Sir Nicholas Carew in Exeter Cathedral, which is a\r\nwonderful representation of the military costume of the period, and the\r\nfine sixteenth century brass at Tiverton, in memory of John and Joan\r\nGreenway. Other good brasses are in Exeter Cathedral and in the churches\r\nof Stoke-in-Teignhead, Stoke Fleming, Clovelly, Braunton, Haccombe, and\r\nClyst St George.\r\n\r\nMany of the churches, that of Pilton, for example, have specially\r\nmusical peals of bells; and there are very old bells at Ogwell,\r\nAbbot's Beckington, Alverdiscott and Hittesleigh. At the latter place is\r\nthe most ancient bell in the county.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Seymour Tomb, Berry Pomeroy Church]\r\n\r\nBy far the most important and remarkable ecclesiastical building in\r\nDevonshire is Exeter Cathedral, which, although not one of the largest\r\nor--externally, at any rate--one of the most majestic cathedrals in this\r\ncountry, is without doubt the most beautiful example in all England\r\nof the Decorated style of architecture. It is built of Beer stone; a\r\nmaterial which when first quarried is white and easily worked, but\r\nwhich, in this case, is now dark and crumbling with age.\r\n\r\nThe two features which specially distinguish this from all other\r\ncathedrals are its transeptal towers, of which the only other English\r\nexample is at Ottery St Mary; and the great length of its roof, which\r\nextends unbroken over nave and choir.\r\n\r\nThe exterior is further remarkable for the statuary on its west front\r\nwith its figures of kings and knights, saints and angels; for its flying\r\nbuttresses and its richly carved pinnacles. And the interior, which has\r\nbeen called the finest in Europe, is distinguished for the beautiful\r\ntracery of its many Decorated windows, the elaborate details of its\r\nside-chapels; its episcopal throne, more than fifty feet high, a marvel\r\nof wood-carving, without a rival in the island; its noble screen, one\r\nof the best in a county particularly rich in screens; its ancient and\r\nquaintly-carved misereres, the earliest in England; its fourteenth\r\ncentury minstrels' gallery, the most nearly perfect known; its long\r\nstretch of stone vaulted roof, the longest of the kind in existence; its\r\nclustered columns; its richly yet delicately carved bosses and finely\r\nsculptured corbels; its many monuments and recumbent effigies of knights\r\nin armour and of bishops in their robes of office; and, generally, by\r\nthe wonderful uniformity and symmetry of its design.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Exeter Cathedral, West Front]\r\n\r\nThe cathedral is the work of many hands. Hardly one of its long line of\r\nbishops but has left his mark upon it. But that it is an architectural\r\nmasterpiece is due in the first place to the genius of one man, and in\r\nthe second place to the wisdom of his successors in faithfully carrying\r\nout his original design.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral stands on the site of a Saxon church, of which no trace\r\nremains; and of the Norman edifice which succeeded it little is left\r\nbut the two transeptal towers. These towers, the northern of which has\r\nbeen much altered, and now has strongly-marked Perpendicular characters,\r\nwere built by Bishop Warelwast (1107-1136), the son of William the\r\nConqueror's sister; and Bishop Marshall (1194-1206), brother of that\r\nEarl of Pembroke who helped Henry II in the conquest of Ireland,\r\nfinished the building in the Norman style. But it was Bishop Quivil\r\n(1280-1291) who planned the reconstruction of the whole cathedral in the\r\nDecorated style, with the exception of the towers, and himself began\r\nthe transformation, rebuilding the transepts, the Lady-chapel, and part\r\nof the nave. And although the work extended over more than a hundred\r\nyears after Quivil's time, and was continued far into the Perpendicular\r\nperiod, the architecture was not altered, and there are few features in\r\nthe building which are not in keeping with the bishop's first design.\r\nThe magnificent Perpendicular eastern window is filled with beautiful\r\nglass of the previous period, and it is believed that its tracery also\r\nwas originally of the Decorated style.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Nave, Exeter Cathedral]\r\n\r\nOf the bishops who succeeded Quivil, Stapledon (1308-1326), a statesman\r\nas well as a prelate and an architect, murdered in Cheapside by\r\nruffian partisans of the She-Wolf of France, carried out some of the\r\nfinest work in the building, including the rood-screen, the episcopal\r\nthrone, and the stone sedilia. Last of the great builders was Bishop\r\nGrandisson (1327-1369), who, in his long tenure of the see, completed\r\nand finally consecrated the cathedral, to which, however, some details\r\nwere added by those who followed him. Bishop Brantyngham (1370-1394),\r\nfor instance, finished the west front, the great east window, and the\r\ncloisters--destroyed by the Puritans and only recently rebuilt. There\r\nhave been two main restorations of the cathedral; one in 1662, and one\r\nbetween 1870 and 1877, when the reredos and other features were added.\r\n\r\nThe chapter-house, which is an exception in style to the rest of the\r\nbuilding, its lower part being Early English, and its upper part\r\nPerpendicular, contains part of the cathedral library. The rest of the\r\n15,000 volumes of books, together with some very valuable manuscripts,\r\nincluding the Exeter Domesday Book, Leofric's Book of Saxon Poetry, and\r\nthe original charter signed by Edward the Confessor, Earl Godwin, Harold\r\nand Tostig, authorising the removal of the see from Crediton to Exeter\r\nare preserved in the Chapter Library.\r\n\r\nIn the north transept of the cathedral are the dials of an ancient and\r\ncurious clock, believed to have been set up early in the reign of Edward\r\nIII, although its movement has been renewed. It sounds the hours and the\r\ncurfew on Great Peter, a ponderous bell in the tower above it. The peal\r\nof ten bells in the southern tower is the heaviest in England.\r\n\r\nAt many points in Devonshire may be seen the ruins of monasteries,\r\npriories, and nunneries which were closed by order of Henry VIII. Almost\r\nall of them have suffered so severely from decay, or perhaps even more\r\nfrom having been used as quarries, that in a great many instances only\r\na few fragments of ruin remain of what, in their time, were large and\r\nmagnificent buildings.\r\n\r\nThese monastic houses were originally founded as places to which people\r\nmight retreat who wished to retire from the world, and to lead simple\r\nlives of holiness, benevolence, and poverty, serving God and benefiting\r\ntheir fellows. For a time the inmates did all these things. As long as\r\nthey were poor they were a blessing to the countries where they lived.\r\nThey preached to the people, they taught in schools, tended the poor\r\nand the sick, practised agriculture and many useful arts, such as the\r\nconstruction of clocks, keeping alive such learning as there was, and\r\nmaking beautiful manuscript copies of the Bible and of the works of\r\nclassical writers which otherwise would have been lost. But when they\r\ngrew rich they became idle, careless, and ignorant, and their lives too\r\noften a scandal to the world. Henry VIII, as the result of a commission\r\nwhich he sent round to enquire into their condition, decided to suppress\r\nthem. The houses were closed, their inmates were scattered, their\r\nestates were sold for trifling sums or given to the king's favourites,\r\nwhile part of their vast wealth was used in founding grammar-schools.\r\n\r\nThe richest monastic house in the county was the Cistercian Priory of\r\nPlympton, of which little now remains beyond the refectory and the\r\nkitchen. Of the Benedictine monastery of Tavistock, an establishment\r\nsecond in wealth only to Plympton, the gateway, a porch, and two towers\r\nalone are left. The remains of the Norbertine abbey of Torre consist\r\nchiefly of the refectory, a gate-house, and the fine building known as\r\nthe Spanish Barn, from a tradition that Spanish prisoners of war were\r\nconfined in it.\r\n\r\nThe two Cistercian houses of Buckfast and Buckland are specially\r\ninteresting. The ruins of the former, which was a very ancient and very\r\nrich establishment, whose last abbot attained his office as a reward for\r\nhaving helped to capture Tyndale, were bought in 1882 by a community of\r\nFrench monks, who have rebuilt much of the abbey in the original style.\r\nPart of Buckland Abbey, which had been converted into a dwelling-house\r\nin Henry VIII's time, was bought and rebuilt by Sir Francis Drake.\r\nSeveral relics of Drake are preserved here, and the house, with its fine\r\ncedars and stately tulip trees, is one of the most picturesque buildings\r\nin Devon. Hartland Abbey, originally founded, like Buckfast, in Saxon\r\ntimes, has also been converted into a dwelling-house, into which were\r\nbuilt the Early English cloisters. At Leigh, near Christow, are the\r\nvery picturesque remains--a fine gate-house, the refectory, and the\r\ndormitory--of a small cell connected with Buckland Abbey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Buckland Abbey]\r\n\r\nOther monastic remains, mostly in a fragmentary condition, are those\r\nat Polsloe (Benedictine nuns), Denbury (Benedictine cell connected\r\nwith Tavistock), Newenham and Dunkeswell (both Cistercian), Cornworthy\r\n(Augustinian nuns), and Frithelstock (a house of Augustinian canons).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21. Architecture--(_b_) Military.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs has already been pointed out, there were in Devonshire a very great\r\nnumber of primitive castles or fortresses, generally on the tops of\r\nhills, and consisting simply of enclosures surrounded by ramparts of\r\nearth or of loose stones. After the Norman Conquest castles of a very\r\ndifferent type, strongly built of stone, were erected in our county, as\r\nin many other parts of England, partly by order of the king himself,\r\nand partly by his knights and nobles, who found it necessary to defend\r\nthemselves against the Saxons, of whose lands they had taken possession.\r\nBy the end of the reign of King Stephen, after less than ninety years of\r\nNorman rule, there were 1115 such strongholds in England.\r\n\r\nThe early Norman castle consisted, as a rule, of a single three-storied\r\ntower with walls of great thickness. But at a later period, after\r\nthe experience gained in the Crusades, and in consequence of the\r\nintroduction of powerful engines capable of throwing great stones\r\nagainst a besieged fortress, military architecture became much more\r\nelaborate.\r\n\r\nThe castles of the Middle Ages, which sometimes occupied a space of\r\nmany acres, were usually built on high ground, or close to a river or\r\nthe sea-shore, and were almost always surrounded by a ditch or moat,\r\nwhich, if possible, was filled with water. Inside the moat was a high\r\nand very thick wall, generally with towers at intervals, especially\r\nat the corners, with a parapet to shelter the men fighting on the top\r\nof it, and with spaces called embrasures through which they could\r\nshoot arrows at the enemy. The principal gate was strongly defended by\r\ncovering towers, and above it were holes through which melted lead, or\r\nboiling water, or hot pitch or sand could be thrown on the besiegers.\r\nThe doorway was reached by a drawbridge, raised and lowered by chains,\r\nand was closed by a heavy door, or a strong grating called a portcullis.\r\nSmaller gates were the postern and the sally-port.\r\n\r\nThe space inside the outer wall was known as the outer bailey, inside\r\nwhich was another wall, also with towers and a gate, within which were\r\ndwellings and store-houses. This was the inner bailey; and within it\r\nwas the most important part of the fortress, the high tower called\r\nthe keep--a building of several floors, with walls 15 or even 20 feet\r\nthick--the last place of retreat when the rest of the castle was taken.\r\nOn the ground floor, which had no windows, were the well, sometimes of\r\nimmense depth, the dungeon, and the store-rooms. On the next floor,\r\nwhich was lighted by narrow loop-holes, were the soldiers' quarters. On\r\nupper floors were the chapel and the apartments of the governor and his\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThere were nearly twenty Norman and mediaeval castles in Devonshire,\r\nfew of them large or elaborate from the military point of view, and\r\nsome, perhaps even the majority of them, insignificant in size and\r\nsimple in style. Of some of these twenty strongholds no trace remains.\r\nAlmost all, of which anything survives, are ruinous and uninhabitable.\r\nAnd although a few have been partially restored and are now occupied\r\nas dwelling-houses, only one, that of Powderham, retains its ancient\r\ndignity, after continuous occupation that has lasted for nearly six\r\ncenturies. Comparatively little is known of the history of these\r\ncastles; but many of them have been the scenes of fighting, especially\r\nin Norman times, in the reign of Henry VIII and during the Civil War.\r\n\r\nOne of the most famous and at the same time one of the oldest of\r\nDevonshire castles, is that of Exeter, called Rougemont from the colour\r\nof the rock on which it stands, built in 1067 by William the Conqueror\r\non the site of an earlier fortress constructed by Athelstan, destroyed\r\nby Sweyn, and restored by Cnut and Edward the Confessor. Its first\r\nNorman governor was Baldwin de Brioniis, the Conqueror's nephew by\r\nmarriage. It, or the city round it, has sustained many sieges; by the\r\nSaxons, by the sons of Harold, by King Stephen, by the Yorkists, by\r\nrebel armies, by Royalists and Parliamentarians, but it was ruinous\r\neven when Fairfax captured Exeter in 1646. A mere fragment, consisting\r\nchiefly of the gateway tower, is all that now remains of it.\r\n\r\nThe picturesque ruins of Okehampton Castle, built, it is believed, in\r\nthe thirteenth century, partly of water-worn stones from the river\r\nbelow, and dismantled by order of Henry VIII, stand in a strong position\r\nabove the West Okement, and include the remains of many rooms and of\r\na great banqueting hall. A French prisoner of war has left a Latin\r\ninscription cut in one of the stones.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the ancient castle of Berry Pomeroy--founded, as\r\nsome think, in the reign of William I--the most picturesque ruin in\r\nDevonshire, standing on a rocky eminence surrounded by dense woods\r\nthree miles north-east of Totnes, consist principally of two towers,\r\nand of the gate-house and the chapel, whose fine masonry, much of which\r\nis thirteenth century work, is overgrown with moss and ivy. Inside the\r\noriginal building stands a very large but unfinished mansion, of great\r\nmagnificence, begun by Lord Seymour, to whom, when Sir Thomas Pomeroy\r\nwas deprived of his estates because of his share in the Commotion of\r\n1549, the castle was given. The property still belongs to the Duke of\r\nSomerset, and has thus been in the hands of only two families since the\r\nNorman Conquest.\r\n\r\nCompton Castle, about two miles west of Torquay, a very strongly\r\nfortified manor-house of the early fifteenth century built on the site\r\nof a castle of William I's time, is specially interesting from its\r\nassociation with Sir Humphrey Gilbert. It is now occupied as a farm.\r\nNearness to the sea, and the consequent danger from the raids of\r\nforeign invaders, led to the strength of its defences. The building,\r\nwhich is large and picturesque, includes a number of ancient features,\r\nespecially the chapel and two gateways.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Compton Castle]\r\n\r\nLydford Castle, now little more than the shell of a square tower, stands\r\non an artificial mound, and is said to have been founded soon after\r\nthe Conquest. It was a place of great importance in the palmy days of\r\nDevonshire tin-mining, when Lydford was one of the chief towns in the\r\ncounty. Here, from a very early period until late in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, was held the Stannary Court, proverbial for its arbitrary\r\nmethods of procedure; and within the walls was a notorious dungeon, used\r\nas the Stannary prison.\r\n\r\nPlympton Castle, built by Richard de Redvers, first Earl of Devon, and\r\nthe scene of fighting in the reigns of Stephen, John, and Charles I, is\r\nnow quite ruinous. Tiverton Castle, ascribed to the same founder, but\r\nreconstructed in the fourteenth century and dismantled after the Civil\r\nWar, has been partly adapted as a modern house. It sustained a brief\r\nsiege, of only a few hours' duration, by Fairfax in 1645. A cannon-shot\r\ncut the chain of the drawbridge, the bridge fell, and the besiegers,\r\npouring in, were quickly masters of the fortress. The chief ancient\r\nfeatures are the great gate, a tower, and the remains of the banqueting\r\nhall and the chapel. The scanty remains of Hemyock Castle, two miles\r\neast of Culmstock, and not far from the border of Somerset, at first\r\ngarrisoned for the Parliament, then taken by the Royalists, and finally\r\ndismantled by Cromwell, consist of little more than the gateway and its\r\ncovering-towers, which are of flint. Totnes Castle, whose ivy-clad walls\r\nof red sandstone look down upon the river Dart, was founded by Judhael,\r\nsoon after the Conquest, but it has been a ruin since the time of Henry\r\nVIII. Of Dartmouth Castle, a very picturesque ruin at the end of a\r\npromontory guarding the harbour, the chief remains are a square tower\r\nof the time of Edward IV, and a round tower of the reign of Henry VII.\r\nThe place may still be seen where a chain was drawn across the river to\r\nGomerock Castle, a small fort on the opposite shore, to keep hostile\r\nships from sailing up the Dart. Kingswear Castle, a small thirteenth\r\ncentury building on the same river, the scene of some fighting during\r\nthe Civil War, has been restored, and is now a private residence.\r\nSalcombe or Clifton Castle, on the Kingsbridge estuary, one of Henry\r\nVIII's coast defences against the long-expected attack of the Spanish\r\nArmada, was the last place on the Devonshire mainland to hold out for\r\nCharles I.\r\n\r\nThe square Morisco fortress on Lundy, whose plain walls now shelter\r\ncottages that have been built inside it, is twelfth century work. The\r\nscanty ruins of Colcombe Castle near Colyton, supposed to have been\r\ndestroyed by the Parliamentarians, and the square tower of Gidleigh, not\r\nfar from Chagford, date, it is believed, from the century following;\r\nand the castle of Ilton, two miles north-west of Salcombe, on the\r\nKingsbridge estuary, now used as a farm, was built in the fourteenth\r\ncentury. Of Torrington Castle a few fragments only are left. The castles\r\nof Exmouth and Bampton have entirely disappeared; and of Barnstaple\r\nCastle, built, it is said, by Athelstan, but ruinous as far back as the\r\nreign of Henry VIII, nothing but the site remains.\r\n\r\nPowderham Castle, the only one of all these fortresses which has been\r\ncontinuously inhabited since its foundation, stands--from a military\r\npoint of view--on a poor site, on low ground close to the estuary of the\r\nExe. Its chief charm is in its setting, in its beautiful park and fine\r\ntimber, especially its magnificent oak-trees. Built in 1325 in the form\r\nof a long parallelogram, with six towers, four of which remain intact,\r\nwhile two have been restored, it has been altered and added to by many\r\nhands, and is now a vast, irregular pile of buildings. Its present\r\nowner is the lineal descendant of its original founder, the Sir Philip\r\nCourtenay who, in 1367, was knighted by the Black Prince on the field\r\nof Navarete. Successfully held for the King in December, 1645, against\r\nFairfax himself, it was taken by Colonel Hammond in the following\r\nJanuary after some sharp fighting, in which the Parliamentary troops, as\r\nhappened on not a few occasions during the war, seized and fortified the\r\nvillage church.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22. Architecture--(_c_) Domestic.\r\n\r\n\r\nScattered up and down over Devonshire are many fine old manor-houses,\r\nsome of them, in parts at least, very ancient, some with picturesque and\r\nstriking features, many set in very beautiful surroundings, and others\r\nof interest for the sake of their historic associations. Such houses\r\nare so numerous that only a few of them can here be even lightly touched\r\nupon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Old Devon Farmhouse Chimney Corner]\r\n\r\nNot one of the famous houses of Devonshire is entirely, or even in great\r\npart, as old as the thirteenth century, although there are several that\r\ncontain features of that period. Such, for example, is Bowringsleigh,\r\nnear Kingsbridge, a fine old building, which although mainly Tudor, and\r\ncontaining details of later eras--beautiful Jacobean oak screens and\r\nhighly-decorated plaster ceilings of the time of William and Mary--has\r\nsome striking thirteenth century work in it.\r\n\r\nAt Little Hempstone, near Totnes, is a very interesting and\r\nwell-preserved pre-Reformation parsonage or priest's residence of the\r\nfourteenth century; and Ayshford Court, near Burlescombe, a fine old\r\nhouse now used like the Little Hempstone parsonage as a farm, contains\r\na fourteenth century chapel. Of the same period are the great hall, now\r\ndismantled, and the old kitchen and other buildings connected with the\r\nmansion of Dartington, which although as a whole a noble example of\r\nElizabethan architecture, was originally erected in the reign of Richard\r\nII.\r\n\r\nManor-houses of the fifteenth century are much more numerous. The most\r\nremarkable of them--indeed, the finest of all the many great houses in\r\nthe county, is Wear Gifford, on the Torridge, about 2-1/2 miles south of\r\nBideford, a perfect example of an old English manorial residence, built,\r\nit is believed, during the reign of Henry VI. Greatly damaged during the\r\nCivil War, the house, which stands in a commanding situation with fine\r\ntimber, especially oak-trees, about it, was for a long period occupied\r\nas a farm, and having become much dilapidated, was restored about eighty\r\nyears ago. It contains many beautiful and interesting details, but the\r\nmost striking of the original features are the square embattled tower\r\nwith the fine entrance archway beneath it, and the magnificent hall,\r\nrising to the whole height of the building, with richly-decorated oaken\r\npanelling and a carved, open, hammer-beam roof which is one of the\r\nvery finest examples of Perpendicular woodwork in England. Other good\r\nspecimens of fifteenth century architecture are Wortham, at Lifton,\r\nnear the border of Cornwall, an almost perfect house of the period;\r\nBradley, near Newton Abbot, a very picturesque building with a fine hall\r\nand chapel; and the main fabric of Exeter Guildhall, which was erected\r\nin 1464 though the front is Elizabethan.\r\n\r\nThe noblest Tudor mansion in Devonshire is Holcombe Rogus, in the\r\nvillage of that name, near Burlescombe, about three miles from the\r\nborder of Somerset. A good deal of the building is a modern restoration,\r\nbut many details of the time of its foundation, in the reign either\r\nof Henry VIII or of Edward VI, still remain. As in the case of\r\nWear Gifford, the most striking features of the house are the very\r\npicturesque tower and gate-house, and the great hall--a magnificent\r\nroom, more than forty feet long, lighted by two great six-light windows.\r\nSome of the rooms are finely wainscoted with curiously carved oaken\r\npanelling. Adjoining the building is the original \"church-house,\"\r\nconsisting of kitchen, refectory, and cellar, where parishioners could\r\ncook their food and brew their beer, where the poor received their\r\ndoles, and where the needs of casual wayfarers were relieved.\r\n\r\nAnother very interesting Tudor mansion, only part of which, however, is\r\nnow habitable, and is used as a farm, is Cadhay, at Ottery St Mary. The\r\ninterior of the house has been a good deal altered, but the exterior\r\nis much as it was in the days of Queen Elizabeth. Its most remarkable\r\nfeature is the inner court, round which the house is built, and in each\r\nof whose four sides, over an arched Tudor doorway, is a highly-decorated\r\nprojecting canopied niche. In these niches are statues of Henry VIII,\r\nEdward VI, Queen Mary, and Queen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nAnother very fine sixteenth century house, containing also some\r\nearlier details, is Bradfield, near Uffculme, in which are a beautiful\r\nmusic-room, a fine banqueting-hall with good panelling, a minstrels'\r\ngallery, and a richly-carved roof. Altogether, this is one of the best\r\nexamples of domestic architecture in Devonshire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hayes Barton: Sir Walter Ralegh's House]\r\n\r\nOther interesting and noteworthy houses of the period are Colleton\r\nBarton at Chumleigh, Flete House at Holbeton, Hayes Barton at East\r\nBudleigh, and Mol's Coffee House in Exeter. Flete has been rebuilt, but\r\nit is a fine mansion, whose beauty is much enhanced by its surroundings\r\nand its avenue of cedars. Hayes Barton, where Ralegh was born--it was\r\nthus he always spelt his name--and where a table said to have belonged\r\nto him is shown, is a rather modern-looking house, plainly built of\r\n\"cobb\"; but its gables, its mullioned windows and its heavy door are\r\ncharacteristic of the time. In Mol's Coffee House, which is one of the\r\nsights of Exeter, is an oak-panelled room decorated with the arms of\r\nDrake, Ralegh, Monk and others, in which the great Devonshire soldiers\r\nand sailors of Armada days were accustomed to meet.\r\n\r\nTwo particularly interesting seventeenth century mansions are Sydenham\r\nHouse, not far from Tavistock, and Forde House, near Newton Abbot. In\r\nthe former, which is a specially fine example of the work of the early\r\npart of the century, containing also some fourteenth century details, is\r\nsome very good carved and decorated woodwork, especially in the form of\r\nartistic panelling and stately staircases. There are also secret rooms\r\nand passages, some of which have been contrived in the thickness of\r\nthe walls. The house was greatly damaged during the Civil War, when it\r\nis said to have been stormed by the troops of the Parliament. At Forde\r\nHouse, which was taken and retaken several times in the struggle between\r\nthe King and the Commons, the Prince of Orange slept on the first night\r\nafter his landing at Brixham. Charles I was there twice, in the first\r\nyear of his reign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mol's Coffee House, Exeter]\r\n\r\nSome good examples of more modern houses are Kingsnympton, in the parish\r\nof that name, about four miles from Chumleigh, surrounded by well-wooded\r\ngrounds, on a commanding eminence looking down on the Taw; Ugbrooke,\r\nnear Chudleigh, standing in a deer-park of rare beauty, finely timbered,\r\nand most picturesquely varied by wood and hill and water, and where\r\nDryden's grove may still be seen; Rousdon, near Axmouth, built of flint\r\nfaced with Purbeck stone, and considered one of the most magnificent\r\nmodern mansions in Devon; Saltram House, three miles east-north-east of\r\nPlymouth, a stately building in a large and beautiful park; and Bicton\r\nHouse near Budleigh Salterton, whose trees, brought from all parts of\r\nthe world, and including a wonderful avenue of araucarias, form one of\r\nthe finest collections of the kind in Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sydenham House]\r\n\r\nOther interesting houses are Ashe House near Axminster, the home of the\r\nDrake family and the birth-place of the great Duke of Marlborough,\r\npartly burnt down during the Civil War and repaired with stones from\r\nthe ruins of Newenham Abbey, and now a farmhouse; Great Fulford, in\r\nthe parish of Dunsford, about eight miles west of Exeter, owned by a\r\nfamily who have held it since the time of Richard I, stormed by Fairfax\r\nin 1645; and the residence in Exeter of the Abbots of Buckfast, a good\r\nexample of mediaeval architecture.\r\n\r\nSome very picturesque old half-timbered houses are to be seen in Exeter,\r\nespecially in High Street, North Street, and South Street; and there\r\nare so many in Dartmouth that the town has been called the Chester of\r\nDevonshire. Nor should the fine old almshouses of Tiverton and Exeter be\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nDevonshire possesses a great variety of building stone; and the\r\nmaterials employed have naturally varied, as a rule, according to the\r\ngeological formation of the district. Some of the best houses are of\r\nBeer stone. Some, as has been shown, are of flint. Brick, which when\r\nof good colour and quality is an excellent material, has been largely\r\nemployed. Many cottages, and even whole villages, such as Otterton and\r\nEast Budleigh, are built of \"cobb,\" which is a mixture of clay and straw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dartmouth: Old Houses in the High Street]\r\n\r\nThatch, which is still used for roofing, although to a less extent than\r\nformerly, has in the past been the cause of many disastrous fires. As\r\nrecently as 1866 more than 100 houses were burnt down in Ottery St\r\nMary. Nearly the whole of Chudleigh was thus destroyed in 1807. Fires\r\nin Crediton, in the eighteenth century, destroyed hundreds of houses.\r\nPerhaps the town that has suffered most severely in this way is\r\nTiverton, where there were very destructive fires in the eighteenth\r\ncentury. One in 1612 consumed almost every house, and in another, in\r\n1598, no fewer than 400 houses were burnt down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Newton Village]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23. Communications: Past and Present.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn prehistoric times Devonshire was crossed by a network of trackways,\r\nsome of which are to-day broad and well-kept high roads. Others form\r\nthose proverbially narrow, awkward, and frequently muddy Devonshire\r\nlanes which are so characteristic of the county, having become worn in\r\nthe lapse of ages so deep below the level of the adjacent country,\r\nowing partly to the softness of the ground, and partly to the heavy\r\nrainfall, that their high banks, although often very beautiful,\r\ncompletely shut out the view. Others, again, that once served merely to\r\nconnect one hill-fort with another, have fallen out of use, and are now\r\nhardly to be traced.\r\n\r\nThese roads, probably begun in the Neolithic Period as footpaths, may\r\nhave been made into tracks for packhorses in the Bronze Age, and more\r\nor less adapted for wheeled traffic by the prehistoric users of iron.\r\nPackhorses, however, usually or frequently in teams of six, were in\r\ncommon use in the county until the middle of the eighteenth century; and\r\nalthough good roads were made across Dartmoor in 1792 there were parts\r\nof that wild district where, before the year 1831, wheeled vehicles\r\nwere unknown. At the present time the total length of all the roads in\r\nDevonshire is only exceeded in the county of Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nIt is generally believed that no Devonshire road was wholly constructed\r\nby the Romans, who probably reached the district by the already existing\r\nBritish coast-road from Dorchester. There are some, however, who think\r\nthat the Fosse Way joined this road and passed through Exeter, going as\r\nfar as the river Teign. The Romans made no road beyond this point, at\r\nany rate; and here, not far from Newton Abbot, they built over the river\r\na bridge of freestone, on whose foundations the modern structure--the\r\nthird since then--now rests.\r\n\r\nSome ancient roads have been abandoned because of their steepness, or\r\nbecause they have been superseded by more convenient ways. Such, for\r\nexample, are the lane from Crockam Bridge over the Teign to Trusham,\r\nand the Lichway (i.e. the way of the corpse) along which, before 1260,\r\nthe dead were carried for burial into Lydford, crossing the river over\r\nWillsworthy Steps, a series of eighteen stepping-stones. One of the\r\nmost remarkable of these old roads was the great central trackway on\r\nDartmoor, leading from Chagford to Tavistock, 10 feet wide, 2-1/2 feet\r\ndeep, and made of rough stones with smaller stones above. Although much\r\nof it has been destroyed for the sake of its materials, about 18 miles\r\nof it still remain. It was during the seventeenth century that the\r\n\"Moor-stones\"--upright monoliths of granite--were set up to serve as\r\nguide-posts for wayfarers during the mists that so often cover the moor.\r\nOne of the most important highways in Devonshire is the great trunk road\r\nfrom London, which enters the county with the Great Western Railway\r\nand accompanies it to Exeter, thence making straight for Plymouth, and\r\npassing on into Cornwall.\r\n\r\nIn common with other English counties Devonshire possesses a number of\r\nhamlets whose names end in \"ford,\" a syllable which, in words of Saxon\r\norigin, means that an old road there passed through the shallows of a\r\nstream or river. Such, to give a few familiar instances, are Chagford,\r\nLydford, and Bideford.\r\n\r\nDevonshire canals are short and unimportant. The hilly country is\r\nnot adapted for them; and such traffic as some of them once enjoyed\r\nhas been absorbed by the railways. There is, however, a good deal of\r\ntraffic on the Exeter Canal--constructed in 1566, and therefore one\r\nof the oldest ship canals in England and the first lock-canal in the\r\nkingdom--but it is worked at a loss. Most of the Bude Canal has been\r\nabandoned, and only two miles of it are now in use. The Grand Western\r\nCanal, running ten-and-a-half miles eastward from Tiverton, nearly to\r\nthe Somerset border--all that was ever made of a waterway intended to\r\nreach Taunton--the Stover Canal, two miles in length, and the Hackney\r\nCanal, only half-a-mile long, both connected with the river Teign,\r\nare all under the control of the Great Western Railway. No Devonshire\r\nriver is now of much value as a waterway. There is some traffic on some\r\nof the estuaries, especially the Teign; and the Tamar is navigable to\r\nGunnislake, a distance of twenty miles.\r\n\r\nThere are in our county some very old lines of stone-tramway for\r\nhorse-traction; from Tavistock to Princetown, for example, and from the\r\nHeytor quarries to the head of the Stover Canal, but they are no longer\r\nin use. Down the former was brought granite to build London Bridge.\r\n\r\nThe railway from London to Bristol was opened by the Great Western\r\nCompany in 1841, was continued to Exeter by the Bristol and Exeter\r\nCompany in 1844, and to Plymouth by the South Devon Company in 1846.\r\nAtmospheric pressure was tried for a time between Exeter and Newton\r\nAbbot, but it was a failure, and was soon superseded by steam-traction.\r\n\r\nBrunel's railways were made on the broad-gauge system with seven feet\r\nbetween the rails, in order to give stability to the trains and to\r\nallow of a high rate of speed; and the entire line from London to\r\nPlymouth was broad gauge. Most other companies, however, adopted the\r\nnarrow gauge, in which there is only four feet eight-and-a-half inches\r\nbetween the rails; and owing mainly to the inconvenience of not being\r\nable to interchange rolling-stock with other lines, the Great Western\r\nRailway Company have converted their whole system to narrow gauge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Teignmouth: the Coast Line and Sea-wall]\r\n\r\nThe Devonshire railways are now owned by two companies only, the Great\r\nWestern and the London and South Western. The latter, which enters the\r\ncounty near Axminster, runs to Plymouth, especially serving the south\r\ncoast to the east of Exmouth, with important branches to Barnstaple and\r\nIlfracombe and to Bude, and with a continuation into Cornwall. The\r\nGreat Western Railway enters Devonshire at two points; near Burlescombe,\r\nrunning thence to Plymouth and into Cornwall, and near Venn Cross, for\r\nBarnstaple. The Cornish Riviera Express from Paddington, which slips\r\na coach at Reading, and, passing south of Bristol, slips another at\r\nExeter, performs the journey of 225 miles to Plymouth--the longest\r\nnon-stop run of any train in England--in 7 minutes over 4 hours, which\r\nis an average speed of 55 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThere are some famous bridges on the Devonshire roads and railways, of\r\nwhich the most remarkable are the Saltash Viaduct, 2240 feet long and\r\n102 feet above high-water mark, built by Brunel across the Tamar; the\r\nold stone bridge of 16 arches over the Taw at Barnstaple, originally\r\nbuilt in the thirteenth century, but since much altered and widened;\r\nthe fifteenth century stone bridge of 24 arches over the Torridge\r\nat Bideford, also much changed from the days when it was only wide\r\nenough for a pack-horse, but always a valuable source of revenue to\r\nthe town from the money that has, at various times, been left for\r\nits maintenance, and has been used to promote education, municipal\r\nimprovements, charity and other objects; and the wooden bridge over\r\nthe Teign at Teignmouth, one of the longest of its kind in England.\r\nVery different in character are the Lydford Bridge, whose single arch\r\nof stone spans the deep gorge of the river, close to the town; and the\r\nancient stone clapper bridges, of which perhaps Post Bridge is the best\r\nknown, already described in the chapter on antiquities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24. Administration and Divisions--Ancient and Modern.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the days of our ancestors the Anglo-Saxons, Devonshire was governed\r\nmuch in the same way as it is governed now. That is to say, while the\r\npeople had to obey the laws that were drawn up under the direction of\r\nthe King, they had a great deal of what we now call self-government.\r\nEvery little group of houses in Devonshire had its own \"tun-moot\" or\r\nvillage council, which made its own by-laws (from the Danish _by_,\r\na town) and managed its own affairs. The large divisions of the\r\ncounty called Hundreds--groups of a hundred families--had their more\r\nimportant \"hundred-moot\"; while the general business of the whole shire\r\nwas conducted by the \"shire-moot,\" with its two chief officers, the\r\n\"ealdorman,\" or earl, for military commander, and the \"shire-reeve\" for\r\njudicial president. The Devonshire shire-moot met twice in the year.\r\nThese three assemblies may fairly be said to correspond to the Parish\r\nCouncils, the District Councils, and the County Council of the present\r\ntime. Our lord-lieutenant corresponds to the ealdorman of other days,\r\nand the present sheriff to the ancient shire-reeve.\r\n\r\nThe division called a Hundred may have been named, as already suggested,\r\nbecause it contained a hundred families. But the present Devonshire\r\nHundreds, of which there are 32, vary a good deal in population. The\r\nHundred of Black Torrington, for example, contains 38 parishes, and the\r\nHundred of Hemyock only three.\r\n\r\nThe Parish is another ancient institution, and was originally \"a\r\ntownship or cluster of houses, to which a single priest ministered, to\r\nwhom its tithes and ecclesiastical dues were paid.\" Many of the 516\r\necclesiastical parishes or parts of parishes situated wholly or partly\r\nwithin the Ancient Geographical County of Devon fairly correspond to the\r\nmanors described in Domesday Book; but the whole country was not divided\r\nup into parishes until the reign of Edward III. The parishes, again,\r\nvary much in size and population. Thus, the parish of Lydford, which\r\nincludes a large part of Dartmoor, and measures more than 50,000 acres,\r\nbeing the largest parish in England, contains 325 inhabited houses and a\r\npopulation of 2812. The parish of Haccombe, on the other hand, contains\r\nthree inhabited houses and nine people.\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth made the parishes areas of taxation, partly, at any\r\nrate, to provide funds for the relief of the poor. In modern times,\r\nwith the idea of taking still better care of the poor, the parishes\r\nhave been grouped together in Poor Law Unions, of which there are 20\r\nin Devonshire, each provided with a workhouse, which was meant to be a\r\nplace in which the able-bodied poor might find employment. Now, however,\r\nthe workhouse is little more than a refuge for the destitute, the idle,\r\nand the incapable.\r\n\r\nThe local government of Saxon times was swept away by the feudal system\r\nof the Normans, which transferred the power of making and carrying out\r\nlaws from the freemen to the lords of the various manors, and was only\r\nrestored as recently as 1888 and 1894.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of each parish, since the latter date, have been managed\r\nby a Parish Council of from 5 to 15 men or women, elected by the\r\nparishioners. District Councils have charge of wide areas, and have\r\nlarger powers. They are, in particular, the sanitary authorities, and\r\nare responsible for the water-supply. The County Council, whose very\r\nconsiderable powers extend to the whole shire, is a small parliament,\r\nwhich can levy rates and borrow money for public works. It manages\r\nlunatic asylums and reformatories, keeps roads and bridges in repair,\r\ncontrols the police in conjunction with the Quarter Sessions, appoints\r\ncoroners and officers of health, and sees that the Acts relating to\r\nlocal government are carried out.\r\n\r\nThe Devonshire County Council consists of 103 members, of whom 77 are\r\nelected every three years by the ratepayers of the various electoral\r\ndistricts; while 26 are aldermen, elected or co-opted by the 77;\r\nthirteen of them in one triennial period, to serve for six years, and\r\nthe other thirteen in the next period, to serve for the same length of\r\ntime. The Council meets at Exeter, four times in the year. Plymouth,\r\nDevonport, and Exeter are called County Boroughs, and their corporations\r\nhave the powers of a County Council. Ten other towns, Barnstaple,\r\nBideford, Dartmouth, Great Torrington, Honiton, Okehampton, South\r\nMolton, Tiverton, Torquay, and Totnes, are called Municipal Boroughs and\r\nare governed by a mayor and corporation.\r\n\r\nFor the administration of justice the county, which is in the Western\r\nCircuit, has one court of Quarter Sessions, the Assizes being held at\r\nExeter; while Petty Sessions, presided over by local justices of the\r\npeace, are held weekly in 22 towns, to try cases and to punish those who\r\nhave broken the law.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Guildhall, Exeter]\r\n\r\nEcclesiastical affairs are in the hands of the Bishop of Exeter, the\r\narchdeacons of Barnstaple, Exeter, and Totnes, together with numerous\r\ndeans and other church officials, in addition to the parish clergy.\r\n\r\nThe County Council appoints a number of Education Committees, who have\r\ncharge of all Government elementary and secondary schools throughout the\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nDevonshire is divided into eleven Constituencies, of which eight\r\nare Parliamentary Divisions, known as those of Honiton, Tiverton,\r\nSouth Molton, Barnstaple, Tavistock, Totnes, Torquay, and Ashburton,\r\neach of which returns one member. In addition to these Plymouth and\r\nDevonport each return two members and Exeter one, so that the county is\r\nrepresented altogether by thirteen Members of Parliament.\r\n\r\nWe may recall with pride the fact that, among the Members for Devon,\r\nhave been some of the most distinguished men who have ever sat in\r\nParliament. Thus, Sir Walter Ralegh sat for the county, Plymouth\r\nhas been represented by Sir Francis Drake, Sir John Hawkyns, and\r\nSir Humphrey Gilbert, Tavistock by John Pym and Lord John Russell,\r\nBarnstaple by Skippon and Lord Exmouth, Okehampton by William Pitt and\r\nLord Rodney, Plympton by Lord Castlereagh and Sir Christopher Wren,\r\nDartmouth by Lord Howe, and Tiverton by Lord Palmerston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25. The Roll of Honour of the County.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamous as our county is for its beautiful scenery, its wealth of\r\nprehistoric antiquities, and the abundance and variety of its wild life,\r\nit is still more renowned for its long Roll of Honour, for the many\r\ngreat and distinguished men who were born in it, or who have been more\r\nor less closely associated with it by residence within its borders.\r\nThere can be little doubt that the foremost man in the whole history\r\nof Devon is Sir Francis Drake, the greatest of Elizabethan seamen, the\r\nfirst English circumnavigator of the globe, the terror of every Spanish\r\nship, and the most conspicuous figure in the defeat of the Armada. Born\r\nnear Tavistock, about 1540, of humble parentage, he early took to the\r\nsea, and was only seventeen when he and his kinsman Hawkyns, in the\r\ncourse of a trading-voyage to Guiana, were so ill-treated at a South\r\nAmerican Spanish port that, for the rest of his life, Drake's chief\r\naim seems to have been to avenge his injuries by plundering the towns,\r\ndestroying the shipping, and capturing the treasure-ships of both Spain\r\nand Portugal.\r\n\r\nAmong his greatest exploits were his voyage round the world, between\r\n1577 and 1580--after which, on his return, he was knighted by Queen\r\nElizabeth on board his ship the _Golden Hind_; the ravaging of the\r\nWest Indies in 1585 and 1586; the destruction in the harbour of Cadiz\r\nof ships and stores intended for the invasion of England, by which he\r\ndelayed for a whole year the sailing of the Armada; and the prominent\r\npart he took in the defeat of the Armada itself, when he captured the\r\nflagship of Admiral Pedro de Valdez.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sir Francis Drake]\r\n\r\nDuring the comparatively few years he spent on shore Drake constructed\r\nthe still-existing leat or water-course for bringing drinking-water into\r\nPlymouth, and he also represented that town as Member of Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn 1595 he and Hawkyns set out for the West Indies on what proved to be\r\ntheir last expedition. Misfortune dogged the fleet from the outset. Both\r\ncommanders died at sea, Hawkyns off Porto Rico, late in 1595, and Drake\r\noff Porto Bello, early in 1596.\r\n\r\nA greater man in some ways than even Drake himself was the gentle,\r\nnoble, lovable, gallant Sir Walter Ralegh, a man who won renown in many\r\nfields, not only as soldier, sailor, and explorer, as courtier and\r\nadministrator, but as historian and poet; whose whole life was crowded\r\nwith adventure and romance, and who is one of the most picturesque\r\nfigures in the entire range of English History.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1552, in a house that still stands at Hayes Barton, he was only\r\n17 when he left Oxford to fight for the Huguenots; and from that time,\r\nexcept for brief intervals at Court, and even shorter periods of quiet\r\nenjoyment of his property in Ireland, or of his home at Sherborne, or\r\nwhen he was a prisoner in the Tower, the rest of his life was spent\r\nin action; now fighting the rebel Desmonds in Ireland, now harrying\r\nthe ships and towns of Spain and Portugal, now helping in the attack\r\non the Armada, now engaged with his half-brother Sir Humphrey Gilbert\r\nin perilous and fruitless exploration in the far north of America,\r\nnow attempting to colonise Virginia--an enterprise whose sole result\r\nwas the introduction to this country of tobacco and potatoes--and now\r\nsailing up the Orinoco in the vain quest of the fabled golden city of\r\nManoa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sir Walter Ralegh and his signature]\r\n\r\nElizabeth, whose favour he won by the sacrifice of his cloak, and lost\r\nagain for a time owing to her jealousy of his passion for one of her\r\nMaids of Honour, when he had to spend four years in the Tower, knighted\r\nhim, gave him vast estates in Ireland, made him captain of the guard,\r\nGovernor of Jersey, Lord Warden of the Stannaries and Vice-Admiral of\r\nDevon and Cornwall. Like Drake, he sat in Parliament; and it was while\r\nstill in favour with the Queen that he was elected Member for his county.\r\n\r\nOn the accession of James I, however, Ralegh was charged with joining in\r\nthe plot on behalf of Arabella Stuart, and was again sent to the Tower.\r\nDuring his long imprisonment there he wrote his most famous work, the\r\n_History of the World_, whose learned, eloquent, and philosophic pages\r\nproved that his skill was no less with his pen than with his sword.\r\nHis stirring description of the last fight of the _Revenge_ inspired\r\nTennyson's noble ballad.\r\n\r\nReleased from prison by James in order that he might once more sail\r\nup the Orinoco in search of the mythical treasure-land ruled over by\r\nEl Dorado, he came back from that most disastrous expedition a broken\r\nman. Again committed to the Tower at the instigation of the Spanish\r\nAmbassador, he was soon afterwards beheaded on the old charge of\r\ntreason, dying as he had lived, dignified, noble, and fearless to the\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nTwo other heroic figures of the Elizabethan age, worthy to be ranked in\r\nthe same company with Drake, are his gallant comrade Hawkyns, who was\r\nborn at Plymouth in 1532, and Grenville the indomitable, the hero of\r\nthat last fight of the _Revenge_.\r\n\r\nSeveral other men who were born in our county have distinguished\r\nthemselves as explorers, or by having helped, by peaceable means, to\r\nfound our over-seas empire. Such were Davis, the arctic navigator,\r\nwho was born near Dartmouth about 1550, who left his name in Davis's\r\nStraits, and who wrote _The Seaman's Secrets_ and other works; Sir\r\nHumphrey Gilbert, born in 1539 at Dartmouth, distinguished as a soldier\r\nin the Irish wars of Elizabeth's reign, but still more as having taken\r\npossession of Newfoundland, thus establishing the first British colony;\r\nGate, who with Somers colonised Bermuda in 1611; and Wills, who perished\r\nin 1861 with Burke in crossing Australia.\r\n\r\nDevonshire has been the native land of many soldiers. Two of the most\r\ndistinguished, both of whom strongly influenced their country's destiny,\r\nand were made dukes as a reward for their services, were Monck and\r\nMarlborough. George Monck, born near Torrington in 1608, distinguished\r\nhimself both by land and sea. He twice defeated the great Dutch admiral\r\nVan Tromp; and although severely beaten by de Ruyter he afterwards\r\ngained a great victory over him off the North Foreland. At first a\r\nRoyalist, he joined the parliamentary army after his capture by Fairfax\r\n(followed by two years in the Tower) and Cromwell made him governor of\r\nScotland. On the death of the Protector he marched to London, and was\r\nthe chief instrument in the Restoration of Charles II, who made him Duke\r\nof Albemarle.\r\n\r\nJohn Churchill, better known as the Duke of Marlborough, born at Ashe\r\nHouse in 1650, was not only the greatest general of his time, but one\r\nof the ablest military commanders the world has ever seen. His most\r\nmemorable successes were the four great battles of Blenheim, Ramillies,\r\nOudenarde, and Malplaquet, in which he defeated the long-victorious\r\narmies of Louis XIV, then the most powerful monarch on the continent. By\r\nthis series of victories, followed by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, the\r\npeace of Europe was secured for thirty years.\r\n\r\nMany great Devonshire men, including some of the earliest who became\r\ndistinguished, were churchmen or divines, not a few of whom are also\r\nfamous as authors. Such, for example, was Winfrid, otherwise Saint\r\nBoniface, and known as the Apostle of Germany, who, born probably at\r\nCrediton in 680, began his career as a Benedictine monk at Exeter,\r\nand after spending many years in converting the wild German tribes to\r\nChristianity, was appointed archbishop of Mainz, and was afterwards\r\nmurdered by the Frisians in 755. Such were Leofric, the first bishop\r\nof Exeter, Warelwast the builder of the Norman cathedral, Quivil\r\nthe designer of the magnificent fabric that replaced it, Stapledon\r\nand Grandisson his able successors, Reynolds the leading Puritan\r\ndivine at the Hampton Court Conference of 1604, whose proposal of a\r\nnew translation of the Bible led to the Authorised Version of 1611,\r\nTrelawney, one of the Seven Bishops whose trial and acquittal formed\r\none of the most memorable events of the reign of James II, Jewel,\r\nBishop of Salisbury, one of the fathers of English Protestantism, the\r\n\"Judicious\" Hooker, author of the _Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity_,\r\nBarclay, who translated Brant's satiric allegory under the title _The\r\nShyp of Folys_, Prince, author of the _Worthies of Devon_, Dean Buckland\r\nthe famous geologist, author of _Reliquiae Diluvianae_, who died in\r\n1856, and Charles Kingsley, born at Holne in 1819, distinguished as an\r\nable and eloquent preacher and as a strenuous worker for the good of\r\nmankind, as poet, novelist, and naturalist, author of many books, and\r\nespecially of _Westward Ho!_ and the _Water Babies_, and of the words\r\nof many beautiful songs, such as the _Three Fishers_. Not a native of\r\nthe county, but Bishop of Exeter in 1551, was Miles Coverdale, whose\r\ntranslation of the Bible appeared in 1535. To him many of the finest\r\nphrases in our Authorised Version of 1611 are directly due.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Charles Kingsley]\r\n\r\nThe most distinguished of the many Devonshire men of letters is\r\nColeridge, poet and dreamer, philosopher and critic, who was born at\r\nOttery St Mary in 1772. That, however, was his sole connection with\r\nthe county. It was chiefly during his three years' residence at Nether\r\nStowey, in Somerset, that the finest of his few masterpieces, especially\r\nthe _Ancient Mariner_ and part of _Christabel_, were written. Amongst\r\nother authors who were born in Devon may be named Gay, writer of plays,\r\nfables, and songs, among them the _Beggars' Opera_ and _Black-eyed\r\nSusan_; Ford the dramatist; William Browne, the author of _Britannia's\r\nPastorals_; Kitto, the deaf compiler of Biblical literature; Merivale\r\nthe Roman historian; Rowe and Risdon, each of whom wrote books on the\r\ncounty; and Froude the historian, author of many books, and especially\r\nof the _History of England from the Fall of Wolsey to the Defeat of the\r\nSpanish Armada_.\r\n\r\nHerrick was not Devonshire born, but it was while he was vicar of Dean\r\nPrior, between 1647 and 1674, that he wrote the _Hesperides_, among\r\nwhich are some of the best lyrics in the language. Dryden, again, was\r\na frequent visitor at Lord Clifford's seat at Ugbrooke, and there is a\r\ntradition that he there finished his translation of Virgil. It was at\r\nLynton that Shelley wrote part of _Queen Mab_. Keats finished _Endymion_\r\nat Teignmouth. Tennyson was often a guest of Froude at Salcombe, and it\r\nis said that he had Salcombe Bar in mind when he wrote his last verses,\r\n_Crossing the Bar_.\r\n\r\nDistinguished in other ways may be mentioned Blundell, the Tiverton\r\ncloth-merchant, who, dying in 1601, left money for the establishment\r\nof Blundell's School; Bodley, born at Exeter in 1545, founder of\r\nthe Bodleian Library at Oxford; John Baring, founder of the great\r\nbanking-house of Baring Brothers; Babbage, the inventor of the\r\ncalculating machine; Bidder, the \"Calculating Boy,\" son of a stone-mason\r\nof Moreton Hampstead; Cookworthy, the originator of Plymouth china; and\r\nNewcomen, a Dartmouth ironmonger, whose improvement on the atmospheric\r\nsteam-engine of Savery, also a Devonshire man, was used early in the\r\neighteenth century for pumping water out of mines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Blundell's School, Tiverton]\r\n\r\nDevonshire has been specially remarkable for its artists, of whom the\r\nmost distinguished were Sir Joshua Reynolds, the great portrait-painter,\r\nborn at Plympton in 1723; Cosway, who painted exquisite miniatures;\r\nSamuel Prout, the famous architectural painter, and Skinner Prout his\r\nnephew; Eastlake, the great painter of figures, and the author of books\r\non art; and Hilliard the goldsmith of Queen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Samuel Taylor Coleridge]\r\n\r\nTwo very famous Devonshire houses are those of Courtenay and Carew.\r\nThere is said to be hardly a parish in all Devon in which a Courtenay\r\ndid not hold land. Courtenays followed the King to many wars. One tilted\r\nwith Francis I at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. Three were at Navarete\r\nwith the Black Prince. Three died during the Wars of the Roses, either\r\nin battle or on the scaffold. Of the house of Carew, one was at Cressy\r\nand another at Agincourt. One was knighted on the field of Bosworth, one\r\nwas at Flodden, and one, while fighting the French, was blown up with\r\nthe _Mary Rose_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26. THE CHIEF TOWNS AND VILLAGES OF DEVONSHIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    (The figures in brackets after each name give the population\r\n    of the parish in 1901, from the official returns, and those at the\r\n    end of each paragraph are references to the pages in the text.)\r\n\r\n#Appledore# (2625). A small sea-port at the mouth of the Torridge,\r\nwrongly supposed, through confusion with an Appledore in Kent, to have\r\nbeen the landing-place of Hubba the Dane. (pp. 27, 61, 130, 131.)\r\n\r\n#Ashburton# (2628). A market-town on the Yeo, eight miles\r\nsouth-west of Newton Abbot, one of the Stannary Towns, with some\r\nmanufacture of cloth. A good centre for Dartmoor, and with a fine church\r\nand other old buildings. Near it are Holne Chase and the Buckland Woods,\r\nwith very beautiful scenery. (pp. 46, 112, 118, 120, 151, 173, 212.)\r\n\r\n#Axminster# (2906). Close to the border of Dorset, high above the\r\nAxe. Interesting for the history of its church, founded in 755, and\r\nendowed by Athelstan after his victory over the Danes. The manufacture\r\nof Axminster carpets was discontinued here in 1835.

Of its castle of Rougemont, built by the Conqueror in 1067,\r\nlittle now remains. But its magnificent cathedral, which contains\r\nmany most beautiful and interesting features, is the finest example\r\nof the Decorated style of architecture in England. Other interesting\r\nor important buildings are the Deanery, the House of the Abbots of\r\nBuckfast, Mol's Coffee House, the Guildhall, and the Albert Memorial\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\nThe history of the town is of the highest interest, and is linked\r\nwith every event of importance connected with the county. It has been\r\nbesieged in turn by Danes and Normans and Saxons, by King Stephen, by\r\nthe army of Perkin Warbeck, and the rebels of the \"Commotion,\" by the\r\nYorkists, and by Royalists and Parliamentarians.

(pp.\r\n170, 171, 173, 176, 178, 195, 200, 221.)\r\n\r\n#Paignton# (8385), a rapidly-growing watering-place on Torbay, with\r\na fine situation, a bracing climate, and good sands (pp. 73, 175, 176.)\r\n\r\n#Plymouth# (107,636), very finely situated at the mouth of the\r\nriver Plym, at the head of Plymouth Sound, a parliamentary, municipal,\r\nand county borough, the chief seat of trade, commerce, and manufactures\r\nin Devonshire, is one of the most famous seaports in the kingdom.\r\nDescribed in Domesday Book as Sutton, and occasionally known as\r\nPlymouth as early as the fourteenth century, it did not definitely\r\nreceive its present name until the reign of Henry VI.\r\n\r\nIts spacious docks, Millbay, the graving-dock and the floating basin,\r\ncan accommodate the largest merchant-ships. In Sutton Pool and the\r\nCatwater, in the Hamoaze--the estuary of the Tamar, the Lynher and the\r\nTavy--and at the head of the Sound, in the shelter of the breakwater,\r\na very large number of vessels find safe and convenient anchorage. At\r\nits numerous quays, connected with the Great Western Railway, to which\r\ncompany the docks belong, are landed passengers and mails from the\r\nUnited States, from Australia and New Zealand, from the West Coast of\r\nAfrica and the Cape, from India and the East, as well as merchandise\r\nfrom all parts of the world, especially from France. Next to Newlyn, it\r\nis the most important fishing-station on the south coast of England.\r\nFurther details will be found in the chapters on shipping and fisheries.\r\nTwo of its most remarkable monuments, both on the Hoe, are a copy of\r\nBoehm's fine statue of Drake, and part of the old Eddystone lighthouse,\r\nre-erected as a memorial to Smeaton.\r\n\r\nPlymouth has had a stirring history. In mediaeval times, especially\r\nin the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, it suffered much from the\r\nattacks of the French, who, in 1403, under du Chastel, are said to have\r\nburnt 600 houses. Its most important periods are those connected with\r\nthe defeat of the Armada, with the Civil War, and with the French war\r\nthat ended with the battle of Waterloo. It was in the Catwater that the\r\nEnglish fleet lay at anchor, while Drake and his fellow-captains waited\r\non the Hoe, the famous ridge between Millbay and Sutton Pool, until the\r\nSpanish ships had passed. More or less closely blockaded from 1642 to\r\n1646 by the Royal forces, and many times desperately assailed, Plymouth\r\nwas the one town in the whole west of England that was never lost to\r\nthe Parliament. In the Napoleonic war the town was the scene of great\r\nactivity, fitting out many naval expeditions against the French, and\r\nreceiving many captured ships.\r\n\r\nMany famous names are associated with the town. It was from here that\r\nthe Black Prince set out for France and the victory of Agincourt. Here,\r\nin 1470, landed the Duke of Clarence, in the hope of enlisting recruits\r\nfor the Lancastrian army. Here, too, came Margaret herself, with Prince\r\nEdward, just before the final overthrow at Tewkesbury. It was at\r\nPlymouth that the Princess of Aragon landed, on her way to marry Prince\r\nArthur. From Plymouth sailed Drake and Hawkyns on their filibustering\r\nexpeditions, and to this port they came back loaded with Spanish gold.\r\nHere, too, came Drake, after his voyage round the world. From here\r\nSir Humphrey Gilbert set out on his last voyage, and from here sailed\r\nCaptain Cook. In the streets and on the quays of Plymouth Benbow and\r\nRodney, Howe and Jervis, Collingwood and Nelson, were, in their time,\r\nfamiliar figures. (pp. 48, 78, 79, 82, 83, 86, 101, 114, 123, 128, 130,\r\n131, 132, 134, 136, 140, 142, 144, 146, 147, 148, 151, 153, 159, 160,\r\n199, 204, 205, 206, 207, 210, 212, 215, 217, 222.)\r\n\r\n#Plympton# (4954), a parish north of Plymouth, comprising two\r\nseparate villages which grew up round the castle and the priory.

(p. 129.)\r\n\r\n#Torquay# (33,625), one of the best-known towns in Devon, is a\r\nlarge and fashionable watering-place, very celebrated for its mild and\r\nequable climate, standing on the south slopes of the northern headland\r\nof Torbay. From the well-sheltered little harbour the town rises in a\r\nsemicircle, so protected from rough winds that palms, myrtles, aloes,\r\nagaves and other sub-tropical trees flourish here freely in the open\r\nair. Near the town is Kent's Cavern, in which have been discovered many\r\nmost interesting remains of extinct animals and of pre-historic man.\r\n(pp. 11, 73, 94, 95, 123, 127, 128, 132, 151, 153, 188, 210, 212.)\r\n\r\n#Torrington# (3241), a market-town on the Torridge, south of\r\nBideford, with important fairs and cattle-shows, and with factories of\r\ngloves. The storming of Torrington by Fairfax in February, 1646, was the\r\ndeath-blow to the cause of King Charles, and practically ended the Civil\r\nWar in Devonshire. (pp. 118, 148, 149, 191, 210, 218.)\r\n\r\n#Totnes# (4035), one of the oldest municipal boroughs in England,\r\nat the head of the navigable portion of the river Dart, is one of the\r\nchief market-towns of the South Hams, with a ruined castle and other\r\nremains of fortification, some picturesque old houses, a fine church\r\nwith a specially good stone rood-screen, and a granite obelisk in memory\r\nof the Australian explorer Wills, who was born here. (pp. 23, 112, 139,\r\n175, 188, 191, 194, 210, 212.)\r\n\r\n#Westward Ho!# a watering-place on Northam Burrows on the shore of\r\nBarnstaple Bay, with a good climate, and with many attractions for the\r\nmarine zoologist, was named in honour of Kingsley's great romance. (pp.\r\n62.)\r\n\r\n#Widecombe-in-the-Moor# (657), a village in the centre of Dartmoor,\r\nwith an annual fair for the sale of sheep and ponies, with many very\r\ninteresting prehistoric remains in the neighbourhood, and a very fine\r\nchurch tower.
