MEX.[A]\r\n\r\nBY J.L. CAMPBELL, M. AM. SOC. C.E.\r\n\r\nWITH DISCUSSION BY MESSRS G.E.P. SMITH, KENNETH ALLAN, and J.L.\r\nCAMPBELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Location_.--The El Paso and Southwestern Railway traverses the arid\r\ncountry west of the 100th Meridian in New Mexico, Texas, and Arizona, as\r\nshown on the map, Fig. 1. The water supply herein described serves that\r\ndivision of this road lying between Carrizozo and Santa Rosa, a distance\r\nof 128 miles.\r\n\r\n_Rainfall_.--The average annual precipitation is 9.84 in. The year 1909\r\nwas exceptionally dry, with a rainfall of less than 5 in.\r\n\r\n_Original Water Supply_.--East and west of El Paso, for distances of 270\r\nmiles in each direction, the railway crosses no streams, and the supply\r\nwas obtained from wells ranging from 100 to 1,100 ft. in depth. On the\r\ndivision served by the new supply, this well-water is of very bad\r\nquality, as shown in Table 1.\r\n\r\nAfter the most thorough practicable treatment, these waters were still\r\nso bad that they caused violent foaming, low steam pressure, hard\r\nscaling, rapid destruction of boiler tubes, high coal and water\r\nconsumption, extraordinary engine failures and repairs, small engine\r\nmileage, low train tonnage, excessive overtime, and a demoralized train\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Presented at the meeting of May 4th, 1910.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 1.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n            |  Incrusting solids, in  |  Non-incrusting solids,\r\n  Station.  |    grains per gallon.   |   in grains per gallon.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCarrizozo   |           31            |             7\r\nAncho       |           14            |            14\r\nGallinas    |           91            |             8\r\nVarney      |          180            |            14\r\nDuran       |          127            |            55\r\nTony        |          115            |            11\r\nPastura     |          141            |             6\r\nPintado     |           81            |             9\r\nSanta Rosa  |          140            |            29\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n_New Water Supply_.--The writer was directed to find, if possible, a\r\nsupply of good water, and his efforts proved successful. The pure water\r\nnow in use has eliminated the adverse conditions before mentioned; has\r\nimproved the _esprit de corps_ of the train service; and, in a short\r\ntime, the reduction in operating expenses will liquidate the first cost\r\nof the new supply.\r\n\r\nThis supply is taken from the South Fork of Bonito Creek, which flows\r\ndown the eastern slope of White Mountain. The latter is 12,000 ft. high,\r\nand is 16 miles south of Carrizozo (Fig. 1). The watershed is a granite\r\nand porphyry formation, heavily timbered, and the stream is fed by snow\r\nand rain. This combination yields an excellent water, carrying on an\r\naverage 6.05 grains of incrusting and O.95 grains of non-incrusting\r\nsolids per gallon. The North Fork of the creek carries 16.60 and 2.40\r\ngrains, respectively. Below the junction of these forks, the water\r\ncontains 10.48 grains of incrusting and 1.57 grains of non-incrusting\r\nsolids per gallon; and a branch pipe line takes water from the creek\r\nduring intervals in dry years when the daily flow of the South Fork is\r\nless than the consumption.\r\n\r\n_The Water Plant_.--The water is taken to and along the railway in pipe\r\nlines. The system includes 116 miles of wood pipe, 19 miles of iron\r\npipe, one 422,000,000-gal. storage reservoir, four 2,500,000-gal.\r\nservice reservoirs, two pumping plants in duplicate, and accessories of\r\nvalves, stand-pipes, etc.\r\n\r\nFrom a small concrete dam across the creek at an elevation of 7,728 ft.,\r\nthe pipe line drops down the narrow valley eastward, 5-1/2 miles, to an\r\nelevation of 6,980 ft, where it turns abruptly north, rising in 1 mile\r\nto a table-land, 7,215 ft. above sea level, across which it continues\r\nnorthward 5 miles to the storage reservoir, which is on the north edge\r\nof this elevated country. Hereafter, this reservoir will be called the\r\nNogal Reservoir, from the old mining village of Nogal lying 1-1/2 miles\r\nto the north and 600 ft. below it. From this reservoir, the line drops\r\nabruptly to the Carrizozo plain, and crosses the latter northward to\r\nCoyote, at Mile 156, on the railway, at an elevation of 5,810 ft.,\r\npassing, on the way, 6 miles east of Carrizozo, to which a branch pipe\r\nruns, Carrizozo being 5,430 ft. above sea level. There is a\r\n2,500,000-gal. reservoir at Coyote, and a similar one at Carrizozo.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 1. MAP OF LINES OF EL PASO & SOUTHWESTERN SYSTEM]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis describes the gravity section of the line which brings the water\r\nfrom the mountain stream to the railway. From Nogal Reservoir to the\r\nlatter, the capacity of the pipe is equal to the future daily\r\nrequirements; from the source of supply to the reservoir, the pipe has\r\ntwice as great a capacity, thereby storing surplus water. This section\r\nis 32 miles long, with a 6-mile branch line.\r\n\r\nThe second, or pumping section, extends eastward along the railway,\r\nrising from an elevation of 5,810 ft. at Coyote to 6,750 ft. on the Corona\r\nsummit, which is the water-shed line between the Rio Grande on the west\r\nand the Rio Pecos on the east. At Coyote a pumping station lifts the\r\nwater to Luna Reservoir and the pumps at Mile 171, and the latter lift\r\nit to the reservoir on Corona summit at Mile 192-1/2. This section is\r\n36-1/2 miles long.\r\n\r\nThe third, or gravity section, extends from the reservoir on the Corona\r\nsummit to the Rio Pecos at Mile 272, dropping from an elevation of 6,750\r\nto 4,570 ft. in 80 miles. The pipe line extends to Pastura, 58-1/2 miles\r\nfrom Corona, as shown on Plate V.\r\n\r\nWhere the pipe line passes a water tank on the railway, a 4-in. branch\r\npipe is carried to the bottom of the tank and up to the top, where it is\r\ncapped by an automatic valve. A gate-valve is placed in the branch pipe\r\nat its junction with the pipe line.\r\n\r\nThere are regulating, relief, check, blow-off, and air-valves,\r\nair-chambers, and open stand-pipes on the line, too numerous to mention\r\nin detail. They are designed to keep the wood pipe full, regulate flow,\r\nprevent accumulation of pressure and water-hammer, and remove sediment.\r\n\r\n_Water Pipe_.--A study of the profile developed a system of hydraulic\r\ngrades, pipe diameters, and open stand-pipes limiting the pressure to\r\n130 lb. per sq. in., except on 19 miles of the pump main between Coyote\r\nand Corona where the estimated maximum pressure is 310 lb.\r\n\r\nInvestigation justified the assumption that wood pipe under a pressure\r\nof 130 lb. would give satisfactory service for 25 years, on which basis\r\nit would be less expensive than cast iron, and therefore it was used.\r\nCast iron was considered preferable to steel for pressures not exceeding\r\n310 lb. on account of its greater durability.\r\n\r\n_Wood Pipe_.--Machine-made, spirally-wound, wood-stave pipe, made in\r\nsections from 8 to 12 ft. long, with the exterior surface covered with a\r\nheavy coat of asphalt, was selected in preference to unprotected,\r\ncontinuous, stave pipe. The diameters were not so great as to require\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\nThe first 40 miles of wood pipe was furnished by the Wykoff Wood Pipe\r\nCompany, of Elmira, N.Y., and the Michigan Pipe Company, of Bay City,\r\nMich., delivered the remaining 76 miles.\r\n\r\nThe pipe is wound with flat steel bands of from 14 to 18 gauge and from\r\n1 to 2 in. wide. The machine winds at any desired pitch and tension. At\r\neach end the spiral wind is doubled two turns, the second lying over the\r\nfirst and developing a frictional resistance similar to that of a double\r\nhitch of a rope around a post. The ends of the band are held by screw\r\nnails or a forged clip, the latter being the better. It has two or three\r\nspikes on the under side which seat into the stave, and two side lugs on\r\ntop which turn down over the band. The latter passes twice over the seat\r\non the clip, the first turn holding the clip to the stave, while the\r\nsecond turn is held by the lugs which are hammered down over it. The end\r\nof the band is then turned back over the clip and held down by a staple.\r\n\r\nThe staves are double-tongued and grooved and from 1-3/8 to 2 in. thick.\r\nThe smaller thickness is sufficient. The exterior face of the staves\r\nshould be turned concentric with the axis of the pipe and form a circle,\r\nso that the band will have perfect contact with the wood.\r\n\r\nThe joints are formed by turning a chamber in one end of the pipe and a\r\ntenon on the other, or both ends are turned to a true exterior circle\r\nand driven into a wood or steel sleeve. The chamber and tenon were used\r\nin this work.\r\n\r\nFinally, each piece of pipe is covered with as much hot asphalt as it\r\nwill carry.\r\n\r\n_Steel Bands_.--The specifications required bands of mild steel, of\r\n60,000 lb. strength, with an elastic limit half as great. The winding was\r\nspaced to limit the tension to 15,000 lb. per sq. in. If severe\r\nwater-hammer is present, the ordinary working stress should be\r\nmaterially less than the latter, otherwise the spiral bands will stretch\r\nenough to permit the water to spurt out between the staves. This was\r\ndetermined to be true on 4,500 ft. of 12-in. pipe connecting the\r\nCarrizozo Reservoir with a water column at the roundhouse there. In\r\npumping tests at the mills, attempts were made, at various times, to\r\nburst the pipe, but they never succeeded. Before the elastic limit was\r\nexceeded, the water was running out between the staves as fast as the\r\npump forced it in. On the following day, pipe thus tested would carry\r\nthe pressure for which it was designed without leaking. Except for\r\ndefects in the band, pipe of this kind will not burst in the service\r\nfor which it is properly designed. This is true, without exception, of\r\nthe 100,000 pieces of pipe in this service.\r\n\r\nThere has been some trouble with a number of the riveted splices on the\r\nbanding. Such a splice occurs for every spool of banding used. In every\r\ncase where one of these splices has pulled apart, the break was the\r\nresult of defective riveting, permitting the rivets to pull out. In no\r\ncase has a rivet been found sheared off, and even one good rivet appears\r\nto be sufficient to prevent rupture. The explanation is found in the\r\nhigh frictional resistance between the band and the pipe, which\r\ndistributes the weakness of a bad splice over several adjacent turns of\r\nthe band around the pipe. The band loosens a few turns only on either\r\nside of a parted splice, generally not more than three. In no case has\r\nany pipe been removed from the trench, repairs being made without\r\ninterruption to the flow of water.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to substitute welding for the riveting of these splices.\r\nThe trouble is not present with the round band, the wrapped splice of\r\nthe latter giving practically 100% efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe flat band was chosen for this work because it is the more\r\neffectively buried in and protected by the asphalt, and will not crush\r\nthe soft wood staves under high pressure. The longevity of either the\r\nflat or the round steel band is dependent primarily on effective\r\nprotection against contact with corrosive elements. Wrought iron should\r\nbe used for this kind of service, and, for the same reason, for many\r\nother purposes. Engineers and consumers should join in some\r\ncomprehensive and effective plan to bring back the old-time production\r\nof high-grade wrought iron.\r\n\r\n_Wood Staves_.--The staves of this pipe are of Michigan and Canadian\r\nwhite pine. This pine cannot now be had of clear stuff or in long\r\nlengths in large quantities; otherwise, it is unexcelled. Douglas fir\r\nand yellow pine, coarser and harder woods, have the advantages of clear\r\nlumber and long length. Cypress is not as plentiful, and redwood is\r\ncostly. The mill tests did not determine definitely the minimum degree\r\nof seasoning necessary, and press of time compelled the acceptance of\r\nsome rather green lumber. Service tests do not show that there is any\r\nabnormal leakage from pipe made of such lumber, and it could not now be\r\ndistinguished in the trench by such tests. Undoubtedly, however,\r\nthorough air seasoning should be required.\r\n\r\n_Bored Pipe_.--Owing to its small size, a part of the 3-1/2-in. pipe\r\nwas bored from the log. This was a mistake, for bored pipe has a rough\r\ninterior and a reduced capacity. The inspection and culling are\r\ndifficult and unsatisfactory, and imperfections readily apparent in a\r\nstave frequently escape detection in bored pipe.\r\n\r\n_Pipe Joints_.--The chamber and tenon of this pipe is an all-wood joint,\r\n4 in. deep. An iron sleeve makes a better and stronger joint. It\r\ncompensates for any lack of initial tension in the banding over the\r\nchamber of the wood joint, and secures full advantage of the swelling of\r\nthe wood. Cast iron is better than steel; it is more rigid, and its\r\ngranulated surface breaks up the smoothness of the wood surface swelling\r\nagainst it. One objection to the cast-iron sleeve is that of cost, but\r\nit adds 4 in. to the effective length of every section of pipe, as\r\ncompared with the wood joints. On the Pacific Coast, a banded wood-stave\r\nsleeve is used with success.\r\n\r\n_Coating_.--To preserve the banding from corrosion and the wood from\r\nexterior decay, the pipe is thoroughly enveloped in refined asphalt\r\nhaving a flow-point adjusted to the prevailing temperature during\r\nshipment and laying. One grade can be used through a considerable range\r\nof temperature. This coating endured a 2,000-mile shipment successfully.\r\nEach piece was carefully inspected along the trench, and any break in\r\nthe coating was thoroughly painted with hot asphalt. Enough of the\r\nlatter came in barrels, with the pipe, from the factory.\r\n\r\nThe first 37 miles of this pipe has been in service for two years.\r\nRecent inspections show the coating to be in excellent condition and the\r\nsteel underneath to be bright and clean. In some cases, where the\r\ninitial pressure and leaking between the staves of the dry pipe were\r\ngreat, the escaping air and water lifted the coating into bubbles. At\r\nsome points where this lifting was great enough to rupture the asphalt,\r\nand the soil is heavily charged with alkali, some corrosion has begun.\r\n\r\nThe integrity and impermeability of this asphalt coat are quite as vital\r\nas constant saturation. This coating protects the entire pipe from\r\nexterior contact with destructive agencies. With such effective exterior\r\nprotection, a constantly full pipe is not so imperative. In the exterior\r\nprotection of the wood, this coated pipe has quite an advantage over\r\ncontinuous stave pipe.\r\n\r\nEach piece of pipe goes directly from the winder to the asphalt rolls,\r\nthen to an adjacent saw-dust table, then back to the rolls, then to the\r\ntable again, and then to the dry finishing rolls at the opposite end of\r\nthe table. The coating thus consists of two layers of asphalt and two of\r\nsaw-dust. When the pipe leaves the finishing rolls, the coat is hard and\r\nsmooth and about 1 3/16 in. thick. This describes the coating as done at\r\nBay City, Mich.\r\n\r\nAt Elmira, N.Y., one application of asphalt and saw-dust only, without a\r\nfinishing dry roll, completed the work; but the band was run through a\r\nbath of hot asphalt as it was wound, thus coating its underside also.\r\nThis initial treatment of the band on the Wykoff pipe is necessary\r\nbecause the exterior of the stave is neither planed nor turned to a\r\ncircle. The exterior of the pipe forms a polygon, and the band is in\r\nperfect contact only at the angles. The theory in regard to the Michigan\r\npipe is that the perfect contact of the band and the wood on the true\r\nexterior circle excludes air from the under surface of the metal, and\r\nprevents corrosion. Experience appears to justify this theory.\r\n\r\n_Cast-iron Pipe_.--Beginning at the first pumping plant at Coyote, at\r\nMile 156, and running up to Mile 166, and again commencing at the Luna\r\npumps, at Mile 171, and extending up to Mile 179, the minimum pressure\r\non those portions of the pump main is more than the 130 lb. per sq. in.\r\nallowed for wood pipe, and the final estimated maximum pressures run up\r\nto 310 lb.\r\n\r\nThe selection of iron pipe for these pressures was, first, as between\r\nsteel and cast-iron; and, second, as between the lead joint of the\r\nstandard bell and spigot pipe and the machined iron joint of the\r\nuniversal joint pipe. Again, the choice was as between lead and leadite\r\nfor the bell and spigot pipe.\r\n\r\nCast iron was selected because of the certainty of its long life, and\r\nthe bell and spigot pipe was selected on the basis of comparative costs\r\nfor pipe laid. The standard lead joint was chosen on the result of\r\ntests. This cast-iron pumping main has a diameter of 12 in. throughout.\r\n\r\n_Pipe Weights._--Makers of standard bell and spigot pipe urged the usual\r\nheavy weights selected for municipal service and heavy water-hammer.\r\nThree pressures, _viz_., 217, 260, and 304 lb., were used for the\r\ndivision of pipe weights, on which the standard pipe-makers specified\r\nshell thicknesses of 0.82, 0.89, and 0.97 in. Eliminating water-hammer\r\nand adopting a working stress of 2,400 lb., the thicknesses are reduced\r\nto 0.54, 0.65, and 0.76 in. To make the latter conform to the\r\nspecifications of the New England Water-Works Association, the pipe was\r\ncast to 0.57, 0.65, and 0.77 in. The reduction in cost amounts to\r\n$52,811.\r\n\r\nBy the provision of air-cushions, hereafter described, the writer's\r\nanticipation of no water-hammer on the pumping main has been fully\r\nrealized.\r\n\r\nThe pipe was manufactured and inspected under the above-mentioned\r\nspecifications.\r\n\r\n_Pipe Joints_.--There was a question about the reliability of the lead\r\njoint at 300 lb. The writer had a section of 12-in. pipe, with standard\r\njoints containing 22 lb. of lead, laid and tested to 500 lb. without\r\nsign of failure or leakage. The joints were caulked down 3/16 in. below\r\nthe face of the bell. Of 8,700 joints thus made in the field, not one has\r\nblown out or failed. A few weeped slightly on top, and they were made\r\npermanently tight by additional caulking. The present maximum pressure\r\nis 278 lb. These joints are the standard joints specified by the New\r\nEngland Water-Works Association. It should be borne in mind that there\r\nis no water-hammer on this line. In 8,700 joints, 198,000 lb. of lead and\r\n3,200 lb. of oakum were used, or 22.76 and 0.37 lb. per joint.\r\n\r\nLeadite was tested in competition with lead, but it leaked at 100 lb.\r\nand failed under a sustained pressure of 300 lb. It is a friable\r\nmaterial, and cannot be caulked successfully. Its principal ingredient\r\nappears to be sulphur. The failure was by slow creeping out of the\r\njoints. It is melted and poured, but not caulked. It has attractive\r\nfeatures for low pressures and for lines not subject to movement or\r\nheavy jarring.\r\n\r\n_Air-Cushions_.--To prevent water-hammer on the pumping main, all pumps\r\nare provided with large air-chambers. In addition, and as the special\r\nfeature for absorbing the shock of pumping under high pressure through a\r\npipe 21 miles long, a large air-chamber in the form of a closed steel\r\ncylinder, 5 ft. in diameter and 15 ft. long, is mounted on the pumping\r\nmain outside of the pump-house. This cylinder is set on its side, in\r\nconcrete collars, directly over the pipe beneath, to which it is\r\nconnected by a 12-in. tee, in which a 12-in. gate-valve is set. The\r\ncylinder is provided with a glass gauge, cocks, etc. It was designed for\r\na working pressure of 300 lb., and, at each pumping plant, it has proved\r\nto be entirely air-and water-tight. As indicated by sensitive gauges on\r\nthe pump main, just beyond these large air-chambers, the latter absorb\r\nall the water-hammer which gets beyond the air-chamber on the pumps.\r\n\r\n_Air-Pumps_.--Each pumping plant is provided with four automatic\r\nair-charging devices, connecting to all air-chambers of the pumps and to\r\nthe air-chamber on the pumping main. They are of the Nordberg type, and\r\nhave proved very efficient. They are operated only a part of the time;\r\notherwise, they accumulate too much air in the chambers.\r\n\r\n_Air-Valves_.--On the entire line there are 144 automatic air-valves\r\nmade by the United States Metal Manufacturing Company, of Berwick, Pa.\r\nThey are working satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n_Gate-Valves_.--In addition to the customary gate-and check-valves at\r\nthe reservoirs and pumping stations, gate-valves are located at\r\nnecessary points and elevations in the line to control the flow of water\r\nand keep the pipe full, even to the extent of closing all such valves\r\ntight and holding the line full without flow. This is for the purpose of\r\ndelivering through a full pipe any desired quantity of water less than\r\nthat required to keep the open pipe full. This, of course, is on account\r\nof the wood pipe. As the differences of elevations are very great on the\r\ngravity sections of the line, and as any one valve might inadvertently\r\nbecome closed tight when other valves above would be open, the bursting\r\nof the pipe under such conditions is prevented either by a pressure\r\nrelief valve attached to and immediately above the gate-valve, or by an\r\nopen stand-pipe erected on some suitable elevation between the valves.\r\nThis is more clearly shown on the profile, Plate V, of the ground line\r\nand the hydraulic grades of the pipe line. An inspection of this profile\r\nwill show that these controlling valves are located so that, when\r\nclosed, the pressure against them does not rise above the maximum\r\npressure on the section above, due to the hydraulic grade of the line\r\nwhen carrying its full capacity.\r\n\r\n_Safety Valves_.--To prevent rupture of the pipe or injury to the pumps,\r\nin case the pumping mains should become obstructed, a 6-in. pop safety\r\nvalve is mounted on the main just beyond the large air-chamber already\r\ndescribed. These valves are set to release at the maximum working\r\npressure of the pumps when the regular quantity of water is being\r\npumped, and they are piped to the adjacent reservoir, so that there is\r\nno loss from them.\r\n\r\n_Check-Valves_.--Check-valves are placed in the pumping main to prevent\r\nthe backward flow of water. There is one near the pumps, and one at the\r\nupper end and outside of the reservoir into which the main discharges.\r\n\r\n_Blow-Off Valves_.--These valves are located in all material valleys or\r\ndepressions.\r\n\r\n_Stand-Pipes_.--Between the gate-valves, at certain points where the\r\nmaximum hydraulic grade is not more than 60 ft. above the surface of the\r\nground, open stand-pipes are erected. If the grade line is too high,\r\nrelief-valves are used, as stated. Also at two points, where a steep\r\ngrade ends near the ground surface and is followed by a flatter grade,\r\nstand-pipes are erected.\r\n\r\nThese stand-pipes are of 6-in. iron pipe standing in a special casting\r\nin the pipe line and enclosed in a concrete base. They are, of course,\r\nopen at the top, and vary in height from 15 to 60 ft., depending on the\r\nelevation of the hydraulic grade. They have given some checks on the\r\nposition of this grade during the velocity measurements hereinafter\r\ndescribed. Their locations are shown on the profile, Plate V.\r\n\r\n_Nogal Reservoir_.--Nogal Reservoir is the storage unit of the system,\r\nand is on the north edge of a table-land, 1,700 ft. above the railway, on\r\nthe Carrizozo plain, 15 miles away. It is 11-1/2 miles from the head of\r\nthe pipe on Bonito Creek.\r\n\r\nThis reservoir is a natural basin or bowl, 1/2 mile in diameter across\r\nthe top, 1/4 mile on the bottom, and 36 ft. deep. A level line, 1,500 ft.\r\nlong, drawn from its bottom, comes out to grade on the north declivity\r\nof the table-land. On this level line an open cut was made and the\r\noutlet pipe laid. The cut was then closed by a dam.\r\n\r\nThe supply pipe from Bonito Creek delivers water into the basin over the\r\ntop of its southern rim, the water, as it leaves the pipe, flowing over\r\na standard weir, without end contractions, into a stone gutter. A\r\nby-pass pipe, with suitable valves, passes around the western side of\r\nthe basin and connects to the outlet pipe.\r\n\r\nThis comparatively small amount of work equipped a very good natural\r\nreservoir with a capacity of 422,000,000 gal., which can be increased to\r\n1,000,000,000 gal. by embankments across low places in the rim.\r\n\r\n_Service Reservoirs_.--At Coyote, an artificial service reservoir, 100\r\nby 200 ft. on the bottom, with slopes of 1-1/2 on 1 and a total depth of\r\n15 ft., serves as an equalizer of the flow to and away from the pumps\r\nat that point. The pump-house is built alongside this reservoir. The\r\ndelivery pipe from the Nogal Reservoir runs directly to the pumps, but\r\nhas a tee-branch, 50 ft. long, into the Coyote Reservoir. This branch\r\npasses through a valve chamber between the pump-house and the reservoir.\r\nIn this chamber there are controlling valves and an automatic overflow.\r\nThis overflow is provided against the contingency of a full reservoir\r\nand idle pumps. If the pipe line is delivering water faster than the\r\npumps discharge it, the surplus goes into the reservoir. This\r\narrangement is self-acting and controlling. There is a similar\r\narrangement at the Luna pumping plant, also at the Carrizozo service\r\nreservoir, and at the regulating reservoir on the Corona summit.\r\n\r\nEach of the four service reservoirs is of the same size, and lined with\r\n4 in. of 1:2:4 concrete. At Luna and Corona the concrete is reinforced\r\nwith 3/8-in. round rods spaced 12 in. from center to center, both ways.\r\nThis reinforcement should have been used in all the work.\r\n\r\n_Pumping Plants_.--The pumps at Coyote and Luna are Nordberg duplex,\r\ncross-compound, condensing, crank-and-fly-wheel machines, with 6-in.\r\nplungers, traveling 600 ft. per min. at full normal speed, and designed\r\nto work against 300 lb. per sq. in. They have a guaranteed efficiency of\r\n135,000,000 ft-lb. per 1000 lb. of steam at 150 lb. and superheated 75\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nThe boilers are 125-h.p., Sterling, water-tube, with Foster\r\nsuperheaters, and 33-in. stacks, 100 ft. high.\r\n\r\nEach plant is in complete duplicate pump and boiler units, only one set\r\nworking at a time.\r\n\r\nThe pump building is a substantial concrete, brick, and steel structure,\r\n50 by 80 ft. in plan, with a fire-wall, with two steel doors dividing\r\nthe floor space into an engine-room 50 by 50 ft., and a boiler-room 50\r\nby 30 ft. A concrete coal-bin adjoins the exterior boiler-room door.\r\nCoal is delivered directly from the car to the bin.\r\n\r\nThe plant is lighted by a small, but very complete, engine and dynamo on\r\none base and run by steam from the Sterling boilers.\r\n\r\nThe two plants are exactly alike throughout.\r\n\r\n_Reservoir Leakage_.--The Nogal Reservoir basin is covered with from 2\r\nto 5 ft. of good clay, except where it is punctured by a dike, or washed\r\ndown to the underlying sandstone by a few gullies. These punctures or\r\nwashes were covered or filled with clay from 1 to 4 ft. deep. During the\r\nfirst season the leakage, above the 6-ft. contour, was at the rate of 2\r\nin. per day.\r\n\r\nAs the water fell, due to leakage, evaporation, and use, a herd of from\r\n300 to 400 cattle were worked around the shore line. This reduced the\r\nleakage to 3/8 in. below 8 ft., and to nothing below 6 ft., above the\r\noutlet. As the flow line rises higher each season, the puddling will be\r\ncontinued to the top. The leakage at 12 ft. above the outlet, or 17 ft.\r\nabove the bottom, is still approximately 1 in. per day. The total\r\npuddling, to date, covering two seasons, is equivalent to 11,150 days'\r\nwork of one cow, and covers an area of 1,500,000 sq. ft.\r\n\r\nThe clay packed densely, the final hoof marks being not more than 1/4\r\nin. deep and remaining distinct under the water around the shore line\r\nfor one year. Apparently, the reservoir will finally become water-tight\r\nat all elevations.\r\n\r\nThe soil in which the four service reservoirs on the railway are built\r\nproved to be about the worst for such work. In its natural state on the\r\nprairie, after the excavation for the reservoir was completed, it\r\nfiltered water at the rate of 3 ft. per day. Tamping and puddling still\r\nleft a filtration of 12 in. per day, with a tendency to increase. Enough\r\nwater filtered through the concrete to produce settlement and cracks.\r\nFinally, the concrete was water-proofed with two coats of soap, two of\r\nalum, and one of asphalt. This has made all the reservoirs water-tight.\r\nElaterite, an asphalt paint made by the Elaterite Paint and\r\nManufacturing Company, of Des Moines, Iowa, was used successfully on the\r\nLuna Reservoir. This paint is applied cold, and preliminary tests showed\r\nit to be quite efficient.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of the soil is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nLoss on ignition                 3.35\r\nSilica                          56.36\r\nOxide of iron                    2.93\r\nOxide of aluminum                8.97\r\nCalcium oxide                   15.95\r\nMagnesium oxide                  0.98\r\nOxides of sodium and potassium   0.47\r\nCarbonic acid                   11.35\r\nSulphuric acid                   0.11\r\nChlorine                         0.04\r\nManganese                      Traces\r\n                               ------\r\n                               100.51\r\nInsoluble matter, 64.50 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pipe-Line Leakage_.--There is no measurable leakage from the iron\r\npipe. By thorough inspection and measurement at the end of two years,\r\nleakage on the wood pipe, between Coyote and Bonito Creek, from the\r\n11-and 12-in. pipe, was found to be as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nOn 8.6 miles, 11-in. pipe, 146,600 gal. per day = 17,046 gal. per mile.\r\n \" 4     \"    12  \"    \"    14,829  \"    \"   \"  =  3,702  \"    \"    \"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 7-1/2-in. pipe on this section appears to be leaking less than the\r\n12-in. pipe. Inspection and measurement of it are to be made in a short\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThere is no material leakage from the 10-and 16-in. pipe between Bonito\r\nCreek and Nogal Reservoir, as determined by velocity and volumetric\r\nmeasurements hereafter described. The greatest probable error in the\r\nvelocity measurements would not exceed 1/2 per cent. If such error\r\nexisted, and was all charged to leakage, it would amount to but 17,204\r\ngal. per day, or 1,582 gal. per mile, out of a daily delivery of 3,784,000\r\ngal.; but the measured discharge of the pipe, as determined by the\r\nvelocity, was 5.84 sec-ft., while the mean maximum volume of this water\r\nover the weir at the end of the pipe is recorded by the weir as 5.88\r\nsec-ft.\r\n\r\nFrom Coyote, east along the railway, the wood pipe is remarkably tight.\r\nThe rate of leakage from it, as determined by 600 observations uniformly\r\ndistributed, was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n11-in. pipe              = 120 gal. per mile per day.\r\n8-1/2 and 7-1/2-in. pipe = 268  \"    \"    \"   \"   \"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe maximum rate on 1 mile was 1,613 gal. The minimum found was zero.\r\n\r\nThe observations were made by uncovering a joint and measuring the\r\nleakage therefrom for 10 min. A graduated glass measuring to drams was\r\nused. The rate of leakage varied from 5 drops to 45 oz. in 10 min. Of\r\nthe joints uncovered 57% was found to be leaking. It is rather\r\nremarkable that, in the large leakage of the 11-and 12-in. pipe between\r\nCoyote and Bonito, only one out of every eight joints was leaking. This\r\nindicates a physical defect in such joints. The largest leak found on\r\none joint was at the rate of 17[,?]280 gal. per day. Leakage between or\r\nthrough the staves is not measurable, as it is not fast enough to come\r\naway in drops unless there is some imperfection in the wood.\r\n\r\nThe insignificant leakage of 120 gal., stated above, is from the 11-in.\r\npipe in the pumping main between Coyote and Corona. The present maximum\r\nworking pressure on it is 100 lb. per sq. in. All the figures given\r\nabove include visible and invisible leakage, the latter being such as\r\ndoes not appear on the surface. The visible leakage is but a small part\r\nof the total.\r\n\r\n_Stopping the Leaks_.--Generally, any ordinary leak is readily stopped\r\nby pine wedges. Sometimes a loose joint requires individual bands bolted\r\naround it. Bran or saw-dust is effective in stopping the small leaks\r\nwhich cannot be reached by the wedges. The good effect of the latter is\r\nlikely to be destroyed by a rapid emptying of the pipe. If the water is\r\ndrawn out faster than the air can enter through the air-valves, heavy\r\nvacuums are formed down long slopes, and the air forces its way in\r\nthrough the joints and between the staves. The result is that the pipe\r\nwill frequently leak badly for some time after it is refilled, although\r\nit may have been tight previously.\r\n\r\nA full pipe and a steady pressure are highly desirable. This doubtless\r\naccounts to some extent for the extreme tightness of the wood pipe in\r\nthe pumping main.\r\n\r\n_Grade Lines_.--The hydraulic grade lines, shown on Plate V, were laid\r\nas best fitting the controlling elevations. The various diameters of\r\npipe were determined by Darcy's general formula, with _C_ = 0.00033 for\r\nwood and = 0.00066 for iron pipe, checking by Kutter's formula, with _n_\r\n= 0.01 for wood and = 0.012 for iron. These coefficients were taken as\r\nconservative and on the safe side, and such they proved to be. It was\r\ndesired that the line should carry not less than 5 sec-ft. to Nogal and\r\nhalf as much beyond.\r\n\r\n_Velocities_.--The pipe line from Bonito Creek to the Nogal Reservoir\r\naffords excellent conditions for velocity and capacity measurements,\r\nthere being no distribution service from it. Beginning at the creek, it\r\nconsists of 12,700 ft. of 10-in. wood pipe, with a hydraulic grade of\r\n0.03338, followed by 48,000 ft. of 16-in. wood pipe, with a hydraulic\r\ngrade of 0.0030625, ending on the south rim of the Nogal Reservoir.\r\nThere is an open stand-pipe where the two pipes and grades join.\r\n\r\nWhen this section of the line was laid, the last car of 16-in. pipe was\r\nlate in arriving and, as it was desirable to get water into the\r\nreservoir as soon as possible, 500 ft. of 10-in. pipe were laid in the\r\nlower part of the 16-in. line, near the reservoir, as indicated on Fig.\r\n2, which shows the hydraulic grades and the pipe diameters of this\r\nsection of the line.\r\n\r\nWhen the first two velocity measurements, of March 10th and 31st, 1908,\r\ndescribed below, were made (after the line had been put into service on\r\nFebruary 20th, 1908), the 500 ft. of 10-in. pipe were still in the\r\n16-in. line, and the hydraulic grade was defined by the solid line,\r\n_ABCDE_, Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nWhen the third measurement, of May 12th, 1909, also described below, was\r\nmade, the 10-in. pipe had been replaced by 16-in. pipe, and the\r\nhydraulic grade was defined by the solid line, _ABE_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dotted line, _AFE_, is the approximate theoretical position which\r\nthe grade, _ABCDE_, should have assumed when the 500 ft. of 10-in. pipe\r\nwere taken out of the 16-in. line. On the contrary, it took the position\r\nof the grade line, _ABE_.\r\n\r\nDuring the interval between March, 1908, and May, 1909, the water came\r\nto overflow from the stand-pipe at _B_, when the line was running under\r\nfull pressure, indicating an increase of capacity in the 10-in. pipe\r\ngreater than a corresponding increase in the 16-in. The alignment of the\r\n10-in. line, vertically and horizontally, is more regular and uniform\r\nthan the 16-in. line. The latter has many abrupt curves and bends,\r\nvertically and horizontally. It crosses nine sharp ridges and dips under\r\nas many deep arroyos. This introduces a fixed element of frictional\r\nresistance which does not decrease with the increasing smoothness of\r\nthe interior surface of wood pipe, and probably accounts for the higher\r\nresistance of the 16-in. line.\r\n\r\nFrom Fig. 2 it appears that, while the 10-in. line had an initial\r\ncoefficient of roughness slightly greater than 0.009 and now equal to\r\nit, the 16-in. line had one equal at first but now slightly less than\r\n0.01.\r\n\r\nThe line from Bonito Creek to Nogal Reservoir was to have a capacity of\r\n5 sec-ft. Referring to the profile, it was determined that for the\r\nhydraulic grade of 33-1/3 ft. per 1000 ft., a 10-in. pipe was necessary,\r\nand that a 16-in. pipe was required for the grade of 3 ft. per 1000 ft.\r\n\r\n_Test No. 1_.--On March 10th, 1908, a quantity of bran was poured into\r\nthe upper end of the 10-in. pipe at _A_ (Fig. 2), and the time of its\r\nappearance at the lower end of the 16-in. pipe at _E_ was noted. The\r\ntime was 3 hours and 50 min.\r\n\r\nThis gave:\r\n\r\nArea   of 10-in. pipe =     0.5454 sq. ft.\r\n  \"    \"  16 \"    \"   =     1.3960  \"   \"\r\nLength \"  10 \"    \"   = 13,200 ft.\r\n  \"    \"  16 \"    \"   = 47,500  \"\r\nTime,                 = 13,800 sec.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet _x_ = velocity of flow in 16-in. pipe, in feet per second, then 2.56\r\n_x_ = velocity of flow in 10-in. pipe, in feet per second.\r\n\r\nFrom which:\r\n\r\n\r\n 13,200    47,500\r\n------- + ------- = 13,800\r\n2.56_x_     _x_\r\n\r\n            _x_   = 3.805\r\n\r\n    and 2.56_x_   = 9.740\r\n\r\n\r\nThe discharge is:\r\n\r\n\r\n     For the 16-in. pipe, 1.396  x 3.805 = 5.31 cu. ft. per sec.;\r\nand, for the 10-in. pipe, 0.5454 x 9.74  = 5.31 cu. ft. per sec.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question arose as to whether or not the particles of bran in the\r\nwater traveled as fast as the water flowed. It was also desired to check\r\nby observation the relative velocities in the two pipes, as above\r\ndeduced.\r\n\r\n_Test No. 2_.--To determine these points, a second test was made, on\r\nMarch 31st, 1908, twenty days after the first one. In this test, green\r\naniline, red potassium permanganate, and bran were used. An observer\r\nwas placed at the end of the 10-in. line at _B_ (Fig. 2), and, by\r\nletting a small quantity of water run from a relief-valve there, he was\r\nable to note the time of the appearance of the colors and the bran.\r\n\r\nThe green was started in the upper end of the 10-in. pipe, at _A_ (Fig.\r\n2), at 8.30 A.M. It appeared at _B_ in 22 min., and at _E_ in 3 hours and\r\n52 min.\r\n\r\nThe red was started at 8.45 A.M. It reached _B_ in 21-1/2 min., but it\r\nwas so faded that the time of its appearance at _E_ could not be noted\r\nexactly.\r\n\r\nThe bran was started at 9.00 A.M. It reached _B_ in 22 min., and\r\nappeared at _E_ in 3 hours and 51 min.\r\n\r\nFrom the average of these figures, the velocities were:\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the 16-in. pipe, 3.792 ft. per sec.\r\n \"  \"  10 \"     \"   9.695  \"   \"   \"\r\n\r\n\r\nand the discharges were:\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the 10-in. pipe, 5.287 cu. ft. per sec.\r\n \"  \"  16 \"     \"   5.293  \"   \"   \"   \"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe application of the equation for equalized relative velocities, as in\r\nthe first test, gives:\r\n\r\n\r\nVelocity in  16-in. pipe = 9.705\r\n   \"     \"   10 \"     \"  = 3.791\r\nDischarge of 16 \"     \"  = 5.292\r\n   \"      \"  10 \"     \"  = 5.293\r\n\r\n\r\nThese last figures would check exactly, except for dropping figures in\r\nthe fourth decimal place.\r\n\r\nThe results of these two tests, considering that 20 days elapsed between\r\nthem, are in very close agreement, and establish the fact that bran is\r\nan accurate medium of measurement.\r\n\r\n_Test No 3_.--The 500 ft. of 10-in. pipe in the 16-in. line near the\r\nreservoir (Fig. 2) were replaced by 16-in. pipe in the summer of 1908.\r\n\r\nOn May 12th, 1909, green aniline was started through the pipe at _A_ at\r\n11.00 A.M., 11.30 A.M., and 12.00 P.M. In each case it appeared at _E_ in\r\n3 hours and 31 min. This time is 20 min. less than that observed in the\r\ntests of the previous year, and is due to the removal of the 10-in. pipe\r\nfrom the 16-in. line and to the increasing smoothness of the interior\r\nsurface of the pipe.\r\n\r\nThe relative velocities and discharges under the third test, using the\r\nnomenclature of the first and correcting the lengths of pipe on account\r\nof the removal of the 10-in. pipe near the reservoir, are:\r\n\r\n\r\n48,000  +     12,700\r\n-----      --------- = 12,660\r\n _x_         2.56_x_\r\n\r\n                 _x_ =  4.183\r\n\r\n         and 2.56_x_ = 10.708\r\n\r\n\r\nand the discharges are:\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the 10-in. pipe = 5.840 cu. ft. per sec.\r\n  \"   \"  16 \"    \"   = 5.839  \"   \"   \"   \"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coefficients_.--On May 12th, 1909, the 10-in. line was working on a\r\ngrade of 0.03338, and, with _n_ = 0.009, _C_ should have been 131. It\r\nwas actually 138, making _n_ = 0.00866. The 16-in. line was working on a\r\ngrade of 0.0030625, and, with _n_ = 0.009, _C_ should have been 145. It\r\nwas actually 141, making _n_ = 0.0092.\r\n\r\nReferring to the estimated hydraulic grade between Coyote and Corona\r\n(Plate V), the coefficients, 0.01 and 0.012, were used for wood and\r\niron, respectively, on which basis, the maximum pressure at Coyote was\r\nexpected to be 304 lb. and, at Luna, 310 lb. per sq. in. The actual\r\nmaximum at Coyote, with pumps at full normal speed, was 270 lb., and, at\r\nLuna, 278 lb., indicating that the values of the coefficients taken were\r\ntoo high. This checks with the tests between Bonito and Nogal.\r\n\r\nOf course, the iron pipe will increase in roughness, and, in time the\r\npumping pressure will approach the calculated amount. The interior of\r\nthe iron pipe now has a smooth coat of asphalt.\r\n\r\n_Pipe Breakage_.--The breakage or damage to the wood pipe in shipment\r\noccurred on the ends, the tenons being most exposed to injury from\r\nshifting in the cars. The damage due to the shipment and handling of the\r\nElmira pipe was 1% and one-half as much for the Bay City pipe. Less than\r\n6 pieces out of 100,000 laid have had to be removed from the trench.\r\n\r\nThe iron pipe came from Chattanooga, and was badly handled in transit.\r\nMuch of it was transferred en route, and 6% was broken when received.\r\nThe breaks were generally cracks of the spigot end. Of this broken pipe,\r\npractically all was cut and laid. The average cut was about 16 in. from\r\nthe spigot end of 533 pieces. This cut pipe has caused no trouble in the\r\ntrench.\r\n\r\nAt least 27 pieces of cracked pipe got past the field inspectors and\r\ninto the trench. This cracked pipe began blowing out at a pressure of 50\r\nlb., and continued until the full normal pumping pressure was reached,\r\nwhen the breaks suddenly ceased. These pipes were broken out at the rate\r\nof 1 or 2 per day, with an occasional day between breaks. A 24-hour\r\nwork-train service was maintained. The pipe gang soon became skilled,\r\nand could put in a new section of pipe in from 4 to 6 hours. Each break\r\ngenerally caused an interruption of about 6 hours to the pumps on the\r\nsection where it occurred. The best record was 3 hours and 50 min. from\r\nthe stopping to the starting of the pumps. This strenuous life lasted 30\r\ndays. Most of these breaks were in or near the middle of the pipe.\r\nEvidently, the field inspectors were not expecting cracks in that\r\nlocality. An inspection usually indicated that the pipe had been struck\r\nby the bell of another one in the vicinity of the break.\r\n\r\nAll pipes were lifted from the car carefully and laid down at the trench\r\nalong the track in a single movement by a logging crane, and were not\r\nbroken in such handling.\r\n\r\nThree breaks only have been reported as due to defective metal or\r\ncasting. No break of a sound shell of full thickness has been found.\r\n\r\n_Trenching_.--Deep frosts are unknown in this section. The pipe was laid\r\nso that the top was about 1 ft. below the surface of the ground. The\r\ntrenching was a simple matter. Part of the work between Bonito and the\r\nrailway on the Carrizozo plain was done by Buckeye ditchers. All other\r\nditching was done by a railroad plow followed by pick and shovel, or by\r\nthe two latter tools only. The ditcher could open 2,000 ft. of trench per\r\nday, but averaged about 500. The plow and 35 men could open 3,500 ft. A\r\nchain about 6 ft. long separated the end of the plow beam and the double\r\ntree. In this way the trench was plowed to the bottom. Two mules, two\r\nmen, and a scraper could back-fill 3,500 ft. per day.\r\n\r\n_Pipe Laying_.--Between Bonito and the railway, one gang of ten men\r\ncould lay 4,000 ft. of 12-in. pipe per day. The average was much less,\r\nowing to a variety of causes. At the end, the railway company added to\r\nthe contractor's force, and laid the last 10 miles of pipe in 7 days,\r\nthere being a half dozen separate gangs at work.\r\n\r\nAlong the railway, the day's record on wood pipe was 4,000 ft. of 11-in.,\r\n6,200 ft. of 7-1/2-in. and 8345 ft. of 3-1/2-in, pipe laid by a gang of\r\neight men after the pipe was distributed along the trench. These eight\r\nmen, of whom five were Americans, laid 76 miles of pipe, and became\r\nexpert. Their operation was like the working of a clock.\r\n\r\nOn the 12-in. iron pipe, the regular day's work was 96 joints, or 1,152\r\nft. of pipe laid and caulked. The record was 1,644 ft. Two gangs laid\r\n101,300 lin. ft. in 60 days. Such a gang consisted of 1 foreman, 1\r\ninspector, 8 caulkers, 4 yarners, 1 melter, 1 pourer, 1 helper, and 10\r\nmen putting pipe into the trench.\r\n\r\n_Cost Data_.--The pipe from Bonito to the railway was laid by contract.\r\nThe price was 18 cents per lin. ft. laid and back-filled from the\r\nrailway to the Nogal Reservoir, and 28 cents from Nogal to Bonito. In\r\naddition, 50 cents per ton per mile was paid for hauling pipe, and extra\r\ncompensation for setting valves. From Coyote, east along the railway,\r\nthe work was done by the railway company under the writer's direction.\r\n\r\nThe total cost of laying 384,300 ft. of wood pipe, from 11 to 3-1/2 in.\r\nin diameter, was $18,156.77, or 4.72 cents per ft., divided as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nDitching       $0.0249\r\nLaying          0.0113\r\nBack-filling    0.0110\r\n               -------\r\n    Total      $0.0472\r\n\r\n\r\nThis includes unloading from the cars. Train service cost 1/3 cent per\r\nft. additional.\r\n\r\nThe pipe gang, including back-filling, consisted of 1 foreman, at $100\r\nper month, one assistant foreman at $75, and about 30 Mexicans at $1 per\r\nday. The rates were the same in the ditching gang. The plow team cost $6\r\nper day.\r\n\r\nIncluding all general expense, the cost does not exceed 6 cents per lin.\r\nft.\r\n\r\nThe cost of laying 101,300 ft. of 12-in. cast-iron pipe was $23826.67, or\r\n23.5 cents per ft., divided as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nDitching       $0.0249\r\nLaying          0.1180\r\nBack-filling    0.0110\r\nLead            0.0790\r\nOakum           0.0014\r\n               -------\r\n    Total      $0.2343\r\n\r\n\r\nThis includes train service and unloading pipe, but nothing for tools.\r\nThe foreman and inspector received $100 per month, the caulkers, $3;\r\npourer, $3; melter, $2.50; 2 pipe-men, $2, and laborers, $1 per day.\r\nProfessional caulkers wanted $5 per day. Carpenters, blacksmiths, and\r\nboiler-makers made good caulkers; their work is standing perfectly under\r\na 275-lb. service.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the pumping plants complete per horse-power is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nPumps      $79.00\r\nBoilers     18.70\r\nBuilding    41.70\r\n           ------\r\n  Total   $139.40 per h.p.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe approximate cost per million gallons of storage capacity is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\nNogal Storage Reservoir  $103.00\r\nCarrizozo Service  \"    3,040.00\r\nCoyote      \"      \"    2,880.00\r\nLuna        \"      \"    3,480.00\r\nCorona      \"      \"    2,720.00\r\n\r\n\r\nTo cover general expense, 3% should be added to all the costs above\r\ngiven. The costs per foot of pipe-laying include the setting of all\r\nspecials, valves, and stand-pipes. The difference of cost in laying\r\n11-in. and 3-1/2-in. wood pipe is not nearly as great as the difference\r\nin diameter or the total quantity laid on record days. While the record\r\nis 4,000 ft. and 8,345 ft., the 76 miles of pipe of all diameters were\r\nlaid in a total time, including all delays, of 223 days, or an average\r\nof only 1723 ft. per day. The cost of the 11-in. pipe is covered by 7\r\ncents per ft. The pipe was laid by a single gang as fast as it was\r\nreceived from the factory.\r\n\r\nThe reduction from 7 to 3-1/2 in. at Mile 230 (Plate V) is on account of\r\ndelivering water to the Santa Fé's new transcontinental low-grade line\r\nwhich crosses the El Paso and Southwestern Railway at Vaughn, and has a\r\ndivision point there. On its adjacent divisions, the Santa Fé had the\r\nsame trouble with local waters which compelled the El Paso and\r\nSouthwestern to find a better supply. The Bonito water is conducted to\r\nand used at points 160 miles from its origin on Bonito Creek.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\nG.E.P. SMITH, ASSOC. M. AM. SOC. C.E. (by letter).--The author has done\r\ngreat service to the West in demonstrating the practicability of\r\ntransporting small water supplies to great distances.\r\n\r\nClose association with the desert is required to appreciate fully its\r\nwaterless condition. For most of the year there are no living waters on\r\nthe surface. As a rule, ground-waters are concentrated beneath very\r\nlimited areas of valley land. The great masses of valley fill in some\r\nplaces are underdrained to great depths and in other places are so\r\ncompacted and cemented as to be impervious. Wells sometimes are driven\r\nfrom 1,000 to 2,000 ft., without securing any supply at all. Moreover,\r\ndesert ground-waters are often exceedingly hard or alkaline, and,\r\ntherefore, are unfit for many uses.\r\n\r\nIn going to the high mountains for a supply, the author has struck a\r\nprinciple of wide application. In many of the mountains of the Southwest\r\nthere are springs and small streams of excellent water. Often, as in the\r\ncase discussed, very little storage is required. These streams, however,\r\nare absorbed or disappear before reaching even the mouths of the cañons,\r\nand the problem has been to convey the water to distant cities and\r\nmining camps at reasonable cost. There are several cities in Arizona now\r\npossessing pumped water supplies, which have possible gravity supplies\r\nof superior quality. The writer believes that ultimately the gravity\r\nsupplies will replace the pumping plants.\r\n\r\nIn the Bonita pipe line, wood-stave pipe was used for the gravity\r\nsections. In other localities, where the grade of the line is very\r\nuniform, as would be the case down a typical clinoplain, cement pipe is\r\ndeserving of consideration. It would cost no more than wood stave, would\r\nbe more durable, and, furthermore, it need have no greater leakage. Its\r\ncost, however, increases rapidly when built to withstand high pressures.\r\n\r\nThe use of bran for determining velocities is of interest. The results\r\nare in close accord with those obtained from the weir measurements. In\r\nthe measurement of ground-water velocities by means of salts in\r\nsolution, it is found that the velocities of different filaments of\r\nwaters are extremely variable, and a quart of salt solution, after\r\nmoving forward a few feet, is widely dispersed. It would be of value to\r\nknow to what extent the bran was distributed during its 4-hour journey\r\nthrough the pipe line, and during how many minutes it was being\r\ndischarged at the lower end of the line. Was the first appearance, or\r\nthe average time of appearance, accepted for computing the velocity of\r\nflow?\r\n\r\nKENNETH ALLEN, M. AM. SOC. C.E. (by letter).--From its lightness,\r\ntoughness, flexibility, and the facility with which it can be laid, wood\r\npipe has manifest advantages for use in inaccessible places and where\r\nhandling is difficult; loss in transportation is almost negligible, it\r\nwill stand much unequal settlement without cracking, and ordinary leaks\r\nare easily repaired.\r\n\r\nThe coating of the bands is of such great importance that it should be\r\ninspected very thoroughly, in order to remedy defects before the\r\nback-filling is done. The writer has found Durable Metal Coating an\r\nexcellent preservative. Bands coated with this preparation were buried\r\nin a salt marsh, and, after a year, the metal was found intact and the\r\ncoating fresh and elastic. This coating, however, does not adhere very\r\nfirmly to a smooth metal surface, so that, with careless handling,\r\npatches may become rubbed or torn off.\r\n\r\nThere is no advantage in coating the surface of the pipe. To prevent\r\ndecay, such pipe should carry water under pressure or be laid in a\r\nsaturated soil, so that the wood of which it is made will always be\r\nsaturated, and coating the wood may interfere with this. Under these\r\nconditions the life of such pipe is not known, but it is evidently very\r\ngreat. Large quantities of wood pipe have been removed from trenches in\r\nBoston, New York City. Philadelphia, Baltimore, and elsewhere, usually\r\nin perfectly sound condition. It was commonly made of logs of spruce,\r\nyellow pine, or oak, from 12 to 18 ft. long, 12 to 24 in. in diameter,\r\nand with a bore from 3 to 6 in. in diameter. Some 6-in. pipe taken up in\r\nPhiladelphia had an external diameter of 30 in. The ends were usually\r\nbound with wrought-iron collars, and adjacent lengths were connected by\r\nan iron thimble driven into the end of each piece.\r\n\r\nA few years ago the writer took up more than 2000 ft. of wood pipe of\r\nthis kind, which had been laid in saturated soil about a century\r\nearlier. It was of Southern pine logs, about 16 in. in diameter, 14-1/2\r\nft. long, and had a 5-in. bore. Joints were made with tapering cast-iron\r\nferrules 9 in. long, and connections to smaller service pipes were made\r\nwith similar but smaller ferrules of cast brass. The wood was apparently\r\nas sound as when it was first laid.\r\n\r\nThe use of flat iron for wrapping or banding pipe is believed to be\r\nwrong in principle. Round iron furnishes the requisite strength with the\r\nleast exposure to corrosion, and ensures a more perfect contact with the\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nIn a 42-in. stave pipe laid by the writer for the Water Department of\r\nAtlantic City, N.J., the lumber used was Washington fir, cypress having\r\nbeen found difficult to procure in sufficient quantity, and redwood\r\nbeing more costly and no better. In this, his experience coincided with\r\nthat of the author. Cedar was considered, but could not be obtained in\r\nsufficient lengths or quantity, and long-leaf pine which would have\r\npassed the somewhat rigid specifications would have been difficult to\r\nsecure. It is believed, however, that there is a field at least for\r\nlong-leaf pine for such construction. Washington fir was found admirable\r\nin every respect, and was moderate in cost at that time.\r\n\r\nThe bands were bent in the field, and, after heating in an oven for\r\nabout 3 min., were dipped in bunches of five into a kettle of melted\r\nmineral rubber at a temperature of about 400° Fahr., and then hung up\r\nfor the coating to harden. This took place rapidly, as the work was done\r\nin winter. If the band were wound spirally, the coating would have to be\r\ndone in the shop, but field coating is preferable, as it avoids injury\r\nto the coating during transportation.\r\n\r\nAn advantage of wood pipe for conveying water is its low coefficient of\r\nfriction. The results obtained by the author (_n_ = 0.00866 to 0.0092)\r\nappear to be very low as compared with determinations made for\r\nwood-stave pipe. Kutter's coefficient for the latter varies from 0.0096\r\nin the case of the 30-in. pipe at Denver,[B] to from 0.012 to 0.015 as\r\ndetermined by Messrs. Marx, Wing, and Hoskins for the 72-in. pipe of the\r\nPioneer Power Plant of Ogden.[C] Probably 0.011 would be a fairly safe\r\nfigure to use in designing new work.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. DETAILS OF OLD WOOD PIPE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJ.L. CAMPBELL, M. AM. SOC. C.E. (by letter).--Referring to Mr. Smith's\r\nquestion about the velocity measurements by bran, the first appearance\r\nof the bran and the colors was taken because the intervals of time given\r\nthereby were in close accord among themselves and with the weir\r\nmeasurements. The time from the first trace of bran or color until final\r\ndisappearance varied between 15 and 20 min. Bran in abundance or\r\npronounced color showed in 2 min. after the first appearance, while the\r\ndisappearance or fading was noticeable after a period of from 7 to 10\r\nmin. It required 2-1/2 min. to get the bran or colors into the intake at\r\nthe head of the line and leave the water clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: _Transactions_, Am. Soc. C.E., Vol. XXXVI, p. 26.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: _Journal_, New England Water Works Assoc., Vol. XXII, p.\r\n279.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Allen refers to the bored wood pipe laid many years ago in Eastern\r\ncities. The writer's experience indicates that a bored pipe will not\r\ndeliver as much water as a planed stave pipe, on account of the greater\r\ninterior roughness of the former.\r\n\r\nReferring to the profile, the 8-1/2-in. pipe between Corona and Duran\r\nhad a theoretical capacity of 744,000 gal. per day. A recent test showed\r\nit to be delivering water at the rate of 759,000 gal. per day.\r\n\r\nThe 3-1/2-in. pipe between Vaughn and Pastura had a theoretical capacity\r\nof 84 000 gal. per day. It delivers only 65,000 gal. per day. There are\r\n5 miles of bored pipe on the upper end of this section. Pressure\r\ngaugings show a hydraulic gradient in excess of the theoretical on the\r\nbored pipe, whereas the stave pipe on the lower end carries the 65,000\r\ngal. on a flatter gradient than the theoretical one.\r\n\r\nExperience on this pipe line indicates that _n_ = 0.009, in Kutter's\r\nformula, closely approximates the capacity of planed wood stave pipes of\r\n8 to 16 in. in diameter. The writer favors the use of 0.01 as\r\nconservative and economical.\r\n\r\nWith equal exposure to corrosion, the round band is undoubtedly the\r\nbetter, but the flat band has the advantage of being completely buried\r\nin the protective coat of the particular kind of wood pipe under\r\nconsideration.",
