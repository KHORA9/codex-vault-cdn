Matters contained in it are within the\r\nLiberty of their Province. The Art of Oeconomy is divided, as Xenophon\r\ntells us, between the Men and the Women; the Men have the most dangerous\r\nand laborious Share of it in the Fields, and without doors, and the Women\r\nhave the Care and Management of every Business within doors, and to see\r\nafter the good ordering of whatever is belonging to the House. And this, I\r\nconceive, is no less the Practice of these Days, than it was in the time of\r\nthat great Philosopher; therefore it may seem necessary that I make some\r\nApology for the Work I now publish, which, for the most part, falls within\r\nthe Ladies Jurisdiction: but I hope I am the more excusable, as my Design\r\nis rather to assist, than to direct. I may call myself rather their\r\nAmanuensis, than their Instructor; for the Receipts which I imagine will\r\ngive the greatest Lustre or Ornament to the following Treatise, are such as\r\nare practised by some of the most ingenious Ladies, who had Good-nature\r\nenough to admit of a Transcription of them for publick Benefit; and to do\r\nthem justice, I must acknowledge that every one who has try'd them, allow\r\nthem to excel in their way. The other Receipts are such as I have collected\r\nin my Travels, as well through_ England, _as in foreign Countries, and are\r\nsuch as I was prompted to enter into my List, as well for their Curiosity\r\nas for their extraordinary Goodness._\r\n\r\n_I could have launched much further in this Attempt, but that I confined\r\nmyself to publish only such as were necessary for the Use of a Farm; or, in\r\nother terms, for the good ordering of every thing which is the Produce of a\r\nFarm and Garden: And especially I am induced to publish a Tract of this\r\nnature for two Reasons, which I think carry some sway with them._\r\n\r\n_The first is, that I find many useful things about Farms, and in Gardens,\r\nwhose Goodness is so little known, or understood, that they are seldom\r\nreckon'd of any account, and in most places are looked upon as\r\nIncumbrances; such as Mushrooms, Lupines, Brocoly, Morilles, Truffles\r\nSkirrets, Scorzonera, Salsifie, Colerape, Charddones, Boorencole, and many\r\nother such like things, which are excellent in their kind, when they are\r\nwell dress'd, and admired by the greatest Epicures._\r\n\r\n_The other Reason which has induced me to publish this Piece, is, the\r\nDifficulties I have undergone in my Travels, when I have met with good\r\nProvisions, in many Places in England, which have been murder'd in the\r\ndressing._\r\n\r\n_I could mention many Instances as bad as the common Story of Bacon and\r\nEggs strewed with brown Sugar: But as this was done through Ignorance, as\r\nthe Story relates, I hope I need make no further Apology, or have occasion\r\nto give any other Reason for making this Treatise publick, but that it may\r\nimprove the Ignorant, and remind the Learned how and when to make the best\r\nof every thing: which may be a means of providing every one with a\r\ntolerable Entertainment founded upon Practice and Fashion; which can never\r\nfail of Followers, and of making us fare much better upon the Roads in the\r\nCountry than we were used to do._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\nCountry Lady's\r\nDIRECTOR\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJANUARY\r\n\r\nI Shall in this Month take particular notice of the Pigeon, whose\r\nCharacteristicks are chiefly to have short Legs, and their Feet of a\r\nreddish Colour, to have long Wings, and to be quick of Flight; in which the\r\nspreading of their Tail-Feathers greatly contribute, as well as to guide\r\nthem in the Air. They by for the most part two Eggs for one sitting, and so\r\nmore; but breed often in the Year. When Pigeons are once paired, it is\r\nobserved they are very constant to one another, and assist each other in\r\nthe Incubation or Sitting on the Eggs, as well as in bringing up and\r\nfeeding the young ones; and moreover it is remarkable, that a Pigeon has no\r\nGall-Bladder.\r\n\r\nThe sorts are, first, the blue wild Pigeon, which is the most frequent in\r\nDove-Cotes, but is not very large, nor disposed to breed so early in the\r\nSpring as some others: they are, however, a hardy kind, and will thrive any\r\nwhere, if there is plenty of Water; for tho' they are not of a watery Race,\r\nyet it is observable, that they covet to be where it is, and that they feed\r\nfrequently upon the Banks of Rivers and Ponds. I have known that where\r\nthere were two Dove-Cotes, that stood within a Mile of one another, and one\r\nof them was near a River, and the other remote from it, the Pigeons of the\r\nHouse distant from the Water, left their Habitation to reside in that next\r\nthe River, even tho' they had an Allowance of good Feed at home.\r\n\r\nAmong the tame Pigeons, those which the _Italians_ call'd _Tronfo_, and we\r\nRunts, are the largest; but these may be again distinguish'd under the\r\nCharacters of greater and smaller: those which are commonly call'd the\r\n_Spanish_ Runts, are very much esteem'd, being the largest sort of Pigeon,\r\nand are sluggish, and more slow of flight, than the smaller sort of Runts;\r\nbut the smaller Runts are better Breeders, and quick of flight, which is to\r\nbe esteem'd; because if they were to seek their Food far, they can range\r\nmuch more Ground, or return home much quicker on occasion of stormy or wet\r\nWeather. As for the Colours of their Feathers, they are uncertain, so that\r\none cannot judge of the sort by them.\r\n\r\nThe next, which makes the largest Figure, but is not in reality the largest\r\nBird, is the Cropper; it is so named, because they usually do, by\r\nattracting the Air, blow up their Crops to an extraordinary bigness, even\r\nso sometimes as to be as large as their Bodies. This sort is esteemed the\r\nbetter, as it can swell its Crop to the largest Size. The Bodies of this\r\nsort are about the bigness of the smaller Runt, but somewhat more slender.\r\nThis sort, like the former, is of various Colours in the Feathers.\r\n\r\nThe next are those Pigeons call'd Shakers, and are said to be of two sorts,\r\n_viz._ the broad-tail'd Shaker, and the narrow-tail'd Shaker: The reason\r\nwhich is assign'd for calling them Shakers, is, because they are almost\r\nconstant in wagging their Heads and Necks up and down; and the Distinction\r\nmade between the broad and narrow-tail'd Shaker, is, because the broad\r\ntail'd sort abounds with Tail-Feathers, about twenty-six in number, as Mr.\r\n_Ray_ observes, and the narrow-tail'd Shakers have fewer in number. These,\r\nwhen they walk, carry their Tail-Feathers erect, and spread abroad like a\r\nTurkey-Cock. They likewise have diversity of Feathers.\r\n\r\nThe next I shall take notice of, are the Jacobines, or Cappers: These are\r\ncalled Cappers from certain Feathers which turn up about the back part of\r\nthe Head. There are of these that are rough-footed: these are short-bill'd,\r\nthe Iris of their Eye of a Pearl Colour, and the Head is commonly white.\r\n\r\nThe next is the _Turbit_, commonly so call'd, but what is the occasion of\r\nthe Name, is not known, unless _Turbit_, or _Turbeck_, is a Corruption of\r\nthe Word _Cortbeck_, or _Cortbeke_, which is the Name the _Hollanders_ give\r\nthem, and seems to be derived from the _French_, where _Court-bec_ would\r\nsignify a short Bill, which this Pigeon is remarkable for; the Head is\r\nflat, and the Feathers on the Breast spread both ways. These are about the\r\nbigness of the Jacobines.\r\n\r\nThe Carrier Pigeon is the next I shall take notice of; it is so call'd from\r\nthe Use which is sometimes made of them in carrying of Letters to and fro:\r\nIt is very sure that they are nimble Messengers, for by experience it is\r\nfound, that one of these Pigeons will fly three Miles in a Minute, or from\r\n_St. Albans_ to _London_ in seven Minutes, which has been try'd; and I am\r\ninform'd, that they have been sent of a much longer Message: however, they\r\nmight certainly be made very useful in Dispatches, which required speed, if\r\nwe were to train them regularly between one House and another. We have an\r\naccount of them passing and repassing with Advices between _Hirtius_ and\r\n_Brutus_, at the Siege of _Modena_, who had, by laying Meat for them in\r\nsome high Places, instructed their Pigeons to fly from place to place for\r\ntheir Meat, having before kept them hungry, and shut up in a dark Place.\r\nThese are about the size of common Pigeons, and of a dark blue or blackish\r\nColour, which is one way of distinguishing them from other sorts: they are\r\nalso remarkable for having their Eyes compass'd about with a broad Circle\r\nof naked spungy Skin, and for having the upper Chap of their Beak cover'd\r\nmore than half from the Head with a double Crust of the like naked fungous\r\nBody. The Bill, or Beak, is moderately long, and black. These Birds are of\r\nthat Nature, that tho' they are carried many Miles from the place where\r\nthey were bred, or brought up, or have themselves hatch'd, or bred up any\r\nyoung ones, they will immediately return home as soon as we let them fly.\r\nPerhaps this may, in some measure, depend upon the Affection the Male or\r\nFemale bear to one another. When they are to be used as Carriers, two\r\nFriends must agree to keep them, one in _London_, and the other at\r\n_Guilford_, or elsewhere; the Person that lives at _Guilford_ must take two\r\nor three Cocks or Hens that were bred at his Friend's at _London_, and the\r\nother two or three that were bred at _Guilford_; when the Person at\r\n_London_ has occasion to send an Express, he must roll up a little piece of\r\nPaper, and tie it gently with a small String pass'd thro'it about the\r\nPigeon's Neck. But it must be observ'd before, that the Pigeons you design\r\nto send with a Message, be kept pretty much in the dark, and without Meat,\r\nfor eight or ten Hours before you turn them out, and they will then rise\r\nand turn round till they have found their way, and continue their Flight\r\ntill they have got home. With two or three of these Pigeon's on each side,\r\na Correspondence might be carried on in a very expeditious manner,\r\nespecially in Matters of Curiosity, or those things which tend to publick\r\nGood. I know a Gentleman that has set out on a Journey early in the\r\nMorning, where it was judged to be dangerous travelling, that has taken one\r\nof this sort of Pigeons in his Pocket, and at his Journey's End, which he\r\ntells me was near thirty Miles distant from his House, has turn'd off the\r\nPigeon, and it has been at its feeding Place in nine or ten Minutes, with\r\nan Account of his safety. In _Turkey_ it is very customary for these\r\nPigeons to be taken on board a Ship that sails, by the Captain, and if any\r\nthing extraordinary happens within the distance of six or eight Leagues,\r\nthe Pigeon is sent back with Advice, which sometimes may be a means of\r\nsaving a Ship from being taken by the Pyrates, or other Enemies, and\r\nexpedite Trade.\r\n\r\nThe _Barbary_ Pigeon, or _Barb_, is another sort, whose Bill is like that\r\nof the _Turbit_, i.e. short and thick, and a broad and naked Circle of a\r\nspungy white Substance round about the Eye, like that in the Carrier\r\nPigeon. The Iris of the Eye is white, if the Feathers of the Pigeon are\r\ninclining to a darkish Colour; but is red, if the Feathers are white, as we\r\nfind in other white Birds.\r\n\r\nSmiters are another sort of Pigeon, suppos'd to be the same that the\r\n_Hollanders_ call _Draijers._ This sort shake their Wings as they fly, and\r\nrise commonly in a circular manner in their flight; the Males for the most\r\npart rising higher than the Females, and frequently falling and flapping\r\nthem with their Wings, which produces a noise that one may hear a great\r\nway; from whence it happens that their Quill-Feathers are commonly broken\r\nor shatter'd. These are almost like the Pigeon call'd the Tumbler; the\r\ndifference chiefly is, that the Tumbler is something smaller, and in its\r\nflight will turn itself backward over its Head. The diversity of colours in\r\nthe Feathers makes no difference.\r\n\r\nThe Helmet is another kind of Pigeon distinguish'd from the others, because\r\nit has the Head, the Quill-Feathers, and the Tail-Feathers always of one\r\ncolour: Sometimes black, sometimes white, or red, or blue, or yellow; but\r\nthe other Feathers of the Body are of a different colour.\r\n\r\nThe next Pigeon I shall take notice of, is that which is call'd the light\r\nHorseman; this is supposed to be a cross strain between a Cock Cropper and\r\na Hen of the Carrier Breed, because they seem to partake of both, as\r\nappears from the exerescent Flesh on their Bills, and the swelling of their\r\nCrops; but I am not determin'd concerning that point, nor can give any good\r\nJudgment about it, till I have seen whether the Cropper be the Male or\r\nFemale, upon which depends a Debate in Natural Philosophy, which has not\r\nbeen yet decided; this sort however is reckon'd the best Breeder, and are\r\nnot inclin'd to leave the place of their Birth, or the House where they\r\nhave been accustom'd.\r\n\r\nThe _Bastard-bill Pigeon_ is another sort, which is somewhat bigger than\r\nthe _Barbary_ Pigeon; they have short Bills, and are generally said to have\r\nred Eyes, but I suppose those colour'd Eyes are belonging only to those\r\nwhich have white Feathers.\r\n\r\nThere is also a Pigeon call'd the _Turner_, which is said to have a Tuft of\r\nFeathers hanging backward on the Head, which parts, as Mr. _Ray_ says, like\r\na Horse's Main.\r\n\r\nThere is a smaller sort than the former call'd the _Finikin_, but in other\r\nrespects like the former. There is a sort of Pigeon call'd the _Spot_,\r\nsuppos'd, and with good Judgment, to take its Name from the Spot on its\r\nForehead just above its Bill, and the Feathers of its Tail always of the\r\nsame colour with the Spots, and all the other Feathers are white.\r\n\r\nLastly, I shall take notice of the Pigeon call'd the _Mawmet_, or\r\n_Mahomet_, supposed to be brought from _Turkey_; however, it is singular\r\nfor its large black Eyes; the other parts are like those of the _Barbary_\r\nPigeon.\r\n\r\nThese are the sorts of Pigeons generally known, for the large _Italian_\r\nPigeons are only the larger Runts; and I am of opinion, that the diversity\r\nof colours in Pigeons only proceeds from the diversity of kinds of Pigeons,\r\nthat couple with one another; for I have known Swine that have been\r\nwhole-footed, that have coupled with those that were clovenfooted, and the\r\nPigs that were produced, were partaking of whole and cloven Hoofs, some\r\none, some two cloven Hoofs, and the rest whole Hoofs.\r\n\r\nConcerning the Life of a Pigeon, _Aristotle_ says, that a Pigeon will live\r\nforty Years, but _Albertus_ finishes the Life of a Pigeon at twenty Years;\r\nhowever, _Aldrovandus_ tells us of a Pigeon, which continued alive two and\r\ntwenty Years, and bred all that time except the last six Months, during\r\nwhich space it had lost its Mate, and lived in Widowhood. There is a\r\nremarkable Particular mention'd by _Aldrovandus_ relating to the Pigeon,\r\nwhich is, that the young Pigeons always bill the Hens as often as they\r\ntread them, but the elder Pigeons only bill the Hens the first time before\r\ncoupling. _Pliny_ and _Athenaeus_, from _Aristotle_, tell us, that it is\r\npeculiar to Pigeons not to hold up their Heads when they drink as other\r\nBirds and Fowls do, but to drink like Cattle by sucking without\r\nintermission; it is easily observed, and worth Observation.\r\n\r\nTo distinguish which are the Males and Females among Pigeons, it is chiefly\r\nknown by the Voice and Cooing; the Female has a small weak Voice, and the\r\nMale a loud and deep Voice.\r\n\r\nThe Flesh of Pigeons is hard of Digestion, and therefore is not judged a\r\nproper Supper-meat; it is said to yield a melancholy Juice, but if boil'd\r\nare very tender, or roasted while they are called Squabs, _viz._ Pigeons\r\nabout four days old, they are much better for the stomach, and then\r\ncommonly yield, among the Curious in eating, about eighteen Pence, or two\r\nShillings a piece. The Food which is generally given to Pigeons is Tares;\r\nbut if we were to mix Spurry-Seeds with it, or Buckwheat, those Grains\r\nwould forward their breeding, as has been try'd: however, if Pigeons are\r\nfed only with Tares, and are of a good kind, we may expect them to breed\r\nnine or ten times in a Year; but sometimes, perhaps, not hatch above one at\r\na time, tho' if they were in full Vigour, they would breed up a Pair at one\r\nsitting.\r\n\r\nIn the feeding of Pigeons, it is adviseable not to let them have more Meat\r\nat one time than they can eat, for they are apt to toss it about, and lose\r\na great deal of it; so that the contrivance of filling a stone Bottle with\r\ntheir Meat, and putting the Mouth downwards, so that it may come within an\r\nInch of a Plain or Table, and will give a supply as they feed, is much the\r\nbest way. And their drinking-water should be dispensed to them in the same\r\nway out of a Bottle revers'd with the Mouth into a narrow shallow Cistern;\r\nbut at the same time they should not want the conveniency of a Pan of\r\nWater, if there can be no better had, to wash themselves in, for they are\r\nof themselves a Bird subject to contract Dirt and Fleas. This is what I\r\nshall say of the breeding of tame Pigeons at present.\r\n\r\nAs to the preparing of Pigeons for the Table, they are commonly either\r\nroasted, boiled, baked, or broiled; these are so generally understood, that\r\nI need not mention them, nor that Parsley is almost become necessary with\r\nthem either to be roasted or boiled in the Body of the Pigeon, or put in\r\nthe Sauces for them: this every one knows, but that the Liver of the Pigeon\r\nshould be always left in the Body of it, is not known every where,\r\notherwise it would not be so generally taken out and lost, as it is in many\r\nplaces remote from _London_; but this may be, perhaps, because every one\r\ndoes not know that a Pigeon has no Gall. As to particular ways of Dressing\r\nof Pigeons, there are two or three which I think are excellent. The first I\r\nhad from a Lady in _Essex_, whom I have had occasion to mention in this and\r\nother Works, and that is in respect to broiling of Pigeons whole. When the\r\nPigeon is prepared for the Kitchen, tye the Skin of the Neck very tight\r\nwith Packthread, and put into the Body a little Pepper, Salt, Butter, and a\r\nlittle Water at the Vent, and tie it up close at the Neck, broil this upon\r\na gentle Fire, flowring it very well, and basting it with Butter. When this\r\nis brought to Table, it brings its Sauce in itself. To those who are not\r\nlovers of Spice or Salt, the Butter and Water will be sufficient to draw\r\nthe Gravy in the Pigeon: but a Pigeon that is split and broiled is of a\r\nvery different Taste from this, and not worthy, in my opinion, to be\r\nreckon'd with it.\r\n\r\nAnother way of ordering Pigeons, which I met with by accident, and pleased\r\nme as well as several Gentlemen in my Company, was the boiling of Pigeons\r\nin Paste: The Receipt the People gave me for it, was, to fill the Belly of\r\nthe Pigeon with Butter, a little Water, some Pepper and Salt, and cover it\r\nwith a thin light Paste, and then to put it in a fine Linen Cloth, and boil\r\nit for a time in proportion to its bigness, and serve it up. When this is\r\ncut open, it will yield Sauce enough of a very agreeable Relish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStewing of Pigeons, from Mons. _La Fountaine,_ an excellent Cook in\r\n_Paris._\r\n\r\nPick and wash half a dozen Pigeons, and lay them into a Stew-Pan, with a\r\nPint or more of good Gravy, an Onion cut small, or three or four large\r\nShalots, a little Bunch of sweet Herbs, some Pepper and Salt, a Pint of\r\nMushrooms that have been well clean'd, and cut into small Pieces, and a\r\nlittle Mace; let these stew gently till they are tender, and add to them\r\nabout half a Pint of White-Wine just before you take them off the Fire;\r\nthen lay your Pigeons in your Dish, and brown your Sauce after 'tis\r\ndischarged of the Bunch of sweet Herbs and the Spice, which should be tied\r\nin a little Linen Cloth; pour then your Sauce with the Mushrooms over the\r\nPigeons, and strew the whole over with grated Bread, giving it a browning\r\nwith a red-hot Iron; or the grated Bread may be omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother Way of dressing Pigeons, from the same.\r\n\r\nTake young Pigeons and par-boil them, then chop some raw Bacon very small,\r\nwith a little Parsley, a little sweet Marjoram, or sweet Basil, and a small\r\nOnion; season this with Salt, and Pepper, and fill the Bodys of the Pigeons\r\nwith it. When this is done, stew the Pigeons in Gravy, or strong Broth,\r\nwith an Onion stuck with Cloves, a little Verjuice and Salt; when they are\r\nenough, take them out of the Liquor, and dip them in Eggs that have been\r\nwell beaten, and after that roll them in grated Bread, that they may be\r\ncover'd with it. Then make some Lard very hot, and fry them in it till they\r\nare brown, and serve them up with some of the Liquor they were stew'd in,\r\nand fry'd Parsley.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of this Month, as well as in _December_, the Eel is\r\ncommonly laid up in the Mud, and we find them there in Clusters folded one\r\nover another, which I suppose is the manner of coupling; for in the\r\nbeginning of _March_, or end of _February_, we see young ones as small as\r\nThreads on the edges of the Waters. I think it is no longer to be doubted,\r\nbut that the Eel is viviparous; that is, it brings its young ones perfectly\r\nframed, and does not lay Spawn like other Fish: and the Resemblance the Eel\r\nbears to that Fish, which is call'd by the Fishermen the Coney-Fish, and is\r\nfound at this time about the _Buoy in the Nore_ full of young ones, makes\r\nme the rather conclude the Eel brings forth its Young perfectly form'd.\r\nThis Fish is not accounted wholesome at this time of the Year, nor fit for\r\neating till they begin to run in _March_, therefore what I have to say\r\nrelating to preparing Eels for the Table, will be set down in the Month of\r\n_March_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY.\r\n\r\nAs our Poultry will begin to lay plentifully in this Month, it may not be\r\nimproper to say something of them before we proceed to give the Receipts\r\nfor dressing and preparing their Eggs for the Table. It is necessary to be\r\nknown first, the Difference between Fowls and Birds; a Fowl always leads\r\nits young Ones to the Meat, and a Bird carries the Meat to the Young: for\r\nthis reason, we find that Fowls always make their Nests upon the Ground,\r\nwhile Birds, for the most part, build their Nests aloft; so then our common\r\nPoultry are Fowls, the Pheasant, Partridge, Peacock, Turkey, Bustard,\r\nQuail, Lapwing, Duck, and such like are all Fowls: But a Pigeon is a Bird,\r\nand a Stork, or Crane, and a Heron, are Birds, they build their Nests\r\naloft, and carry Meat to their young Ones.\r\n\r\nThe Characteristick Marks of the Poultry Kind are, besides what I have said\r\nabove, to have short, strong, and somewhat crooked Bills, which are best\r\nadapted to pick up Grains of Corn, Pulse, and other Seeds, which is chiefly\r\nwhat these Fowls feed upon; and we may observe, that as neither Birds nor\r\nFowls have Teeth to macerate their Food with, so Nature has provided them\r\nnot only with a Crop to soften their Meat, but a Stomach furnish'd with\r\nthick strong Mucles, whose use is to grind the Grains of Corn, or any hard\r\nMeat swallow'd whole, which they perform by the help of little Stones,\r\nwhich Birds and Fowls swallow now and then, and which supply the defect of\r\nTeeth. It is observable, that Fowls, for the most part, lay a greater\r\nnumber of Eggs than Birds, even many more than they can sit upon at one\r\ntime. I have known about thirty Eggs lay'd by one common Poultry-Hen, but\r\nit is seldom that any Bird lays more than five or six, except the Wren, and\r\nthe Tom-tit, and the Pigeon not more than two. Again, the Poultry, contrary\r\nto others of the winged Race, are armed with Spurs; and it is observable,\r\nthat the Cocks of the common Poultry distinguish themselves from diurnal\r\nFowls, by crowing or singing in the Night, as the Nightingale distinguishes\r\nitself from the rest of the Bird-kind. As for the length of Life in common\r\nPoultry, _Aldrovandus_ makes it to be about ten Years, but that the Cock\r\nbecomes unfit for the Hens when he is four Years old; and we find by\r\nexperience the same, as well as that a Cock should not have more than six\r\nor seven Hens, if we expect healthful and strong Broods of Chickens. About\r\nthe Laying-time of these Fowls, Spurry-Seed and Buckwheat is an excellent\r\nstrengthening Food for them.\r\n\r\nThere is another thing relating to Fowls of this kind well worthy\r\nobservation; and that is, of Capons being made to bring up a Brood of\r\nChickens like a Hen, clucking of'em, brooding them, and leading them to\r\ntheir Meat, with as much Care and Tenderness as their Dams would do. To\r\nbring this about, _Jo. Baptista Porta_, in _lib. 4. Mag. Nat._ prescribes\r\nto make a Capon very tame and familiar, so as to take Meat out of one's\r\nHand; then about Evening-time pluck the Feathers off his Breast, and rub\r\nthe bare Skin with Nettles, and then put the Chickens to him, which will\r\npresently run under his Breast and Belly; the Chickens then rubbing his\r\nBreast gently with their Heads, perhaps allay the slinging and itching\r\noccasioned by the Nettles, or perhaps they may contribute to warm that part\r\nwhere the Feathers are away: however, the bare part must be rubb'd with\r\nNettles three or four Nights successively, till he begins to love and\r\ndelight in the Chickens.\r\n\r\nWhen a Capon is once accustomed to this Service, he will not casuly leave\r\nit off; but as soon as he has brought up one Brood of Chickens, we may put\r\nanother to him, and when they are fit to shift for themselves, we may give\r\nhim the Care of a third.\r\n\r\nThe sorts of the House Pullen, or common Poultry, are many; but as the use\r\nof them for the Table is the same, I shall only take notice of such as are\r\nof the large Dunghill kind, or of the _Hamburgh_ sort, of the Game kind,\r\nand of the small _Dutch_ kind; which last is admired by some for the\r\nfineness of their Flesh, and for being great Layers, especially in the\r\nWinter: But it is certain that the larger sort sell the best at Market, and\r\nlay the largest Eggs, and therefore should be the most cultivated about a\r\nFarm. As for the Game Breed, some fancy that their Flesh is more white and\r\ntender than the other sorts; but they are always quarrelling, which\r\ncontributes to make themselves and their Brood weak.\r\n\r\nWhere we propose to raise a large Stock of Poultry, we should be careful to\r\nsecure our Hen-House from Vermin of all sorts, and keep it dry and clean,\r\nallowing also as much Air as possible; for if it is not often clean'd, the\r\nscent of the Dung will give your Fowls the Roop: So likewise there must be\r\neasy Convenience for perching of the Fowls, disposed in such a manner, that\r\nthe Perches be not placed over any of the Hen's Nests, which must always\r\nlie dry and clean, bedded with Straw, for Hay is apt to make the sitting\r\nHens faint and weak. When we design to set a Hen, we should save her Eggs\r\nin dry Bran, and when she clucks, put no more in her Nest than she can well\r\ncover; for as to certain numbers to be more lucky in hatching, there is\r\nnothing in that: And if we fat Fowls, then use the Method prescribed in my\r\n_Country Gentleman and Farmer's Monthly Director_, in the Month of\r\n_January_, which is much the best way of any that has yet been discovered.\r\nIn the choice of Fowls for eating, those which are white feather'd and\r\nwhite legg'd, are much tenderer and finer in their Flesh than those of\r\nother Colours, and are much weaker; for which reason, those who understand\r\nCocking, do not approve of such as happen to be white feather'd: and those\r\nwhich are black feather'd, are accounted the hottest and most fiery, and\r\ntheir Flesh is coarser than in other Fowls. But let us now come to the use\r\nof the Flesh of these Fowls, which is either eaten roasted, boiled,\r\nfricasseed, baked, or broiled either slit or whole. It is to be noted, that\r\nthe Flesh of these Fowls or Chickens boiled is more easily digested than\r\nthe Flesh of those that are roasted, and the Flesh of the Legs is more easy\r\nof Digestion than that of the Breast. Mr. _Ray_ takes notice, that those\r\nparts of Fowls, which are continually in Action, are esteem'd the best, for\r\nwhich reason he prefers the Legs of tame Fowls, and what we call the Wings\r\nin wild Fowl, that is, the fleshy part on the Breast. _Gefner_ and\r\n_Aldrovandus_ have both largely treated of the use of the Flesh and Eggs of\r\nthese Fowls, but I believe some of the following Receipts for dressing\r\nthem, will not be unacceptable, they being more adapted to the Taste of our\r\nTimes.\r\n\r\nI shall begin with some curious ways of dressing of Eggs, which I had from\r\na Gentleman of _Brussels_, who had collected them from most parts of\r\n_Europe_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Way of dressing of Eggs.\r\n\r\nBoil your Eggs till they are hard, and cut the Whites only into Rings or\r\nlarge pieces; then cut some Parsley and Onions small, and stew them with a\r\nlittle Salt, Pepper, and Nutmeg in half a Pint of Water, till the Onion and\r\nParsley is tender; when this is done, put in your Eggs well flower'd, and\r\nas soon as they are hot, put half a Pint of Cream to them, and thicken them\r\nfor serving at the Table. The Yolks may be fry'd to garnish the Dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond Way of preparing of Eggs.\r\n\r\nBoil your Eggs hard as before, and cut the Whites likewise as directed in\r\nthe above Receipt, and then prepare some Gravy, a bunch of sweet Herbs, a\r\nlittle Salt, some Lemon Peel, some _Jamaica_ Pepper beaten small, an Onion\r\nshred small, and let these stew together till it is sufficiently season'd;\r\nafter which, strain it off, and put in the Eggs to heat them thoroughly,\r\nand then thicken the whole with burnt Butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThird Way of preparing of Eggs.\r\n\r\nBreak some Eggs, beat them well, and season them with Salt and some\r\n_Jamaica_ Pepper finely powder'd, then make some Butter very hot in a Pan,\r\nand pour in the Mixture to fry, till it is hard enough to hold together;\r\nthen it must be taken out, and cut into several Pieces, and served with the\r\nsame Sauce directed in the foregoing Receipt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFourth Way of dressing of Eggs.\r\n\r\nTake the Hearts of two or three Cabbage-Lettuces, a little Sorrel, Parsley,\r\nCherville, and a large Mushroom, put them in Water over the Fire till they\r\nare tender, then chop them together very small with some Yolks of hard\r\nEggs, and season the whole with Salt, Pepper, or Nutmeg; and when the Mass\r\nis well mixt together, put them in paste, making them into small flat\r\nPuffs, and fry them. This may be diversify'd, by adding some sweet Herbs\r\nchop'd small to the Mixture, before it is put into Paste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFifth Way of dressing of Eggs.\r\n\r\nBeat as many Eggs as you think convenient, and at the same time squeeze the\r\nJuice of an Orange among them; being well beaten, season them with a little\r\nSalt, then take a Stew-Pan, and if it is a Fast-day, put some Butter into\r\nit and pour in your Eggs, keeping them stirring continually over the Fire\r\ntill they are enough, then pour them into a Plate upon Sippets. But on\r\nFlesh-days, instead of Butter use strong Gravy, or on Fish-days some\r\nMushroom-Gravy may be used instead of Butter, or with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSixth Way of ordering of Eggs.\r\n\r\nBoil Eggs till they are hard, peel them, and cut them lengthways, then\r\nquarter each half, and dip the several quarters in Batter, made of Flower,\r\nEggs and Milk; fry them then in Butter very hot, over a quick Fire, and lay\r\nthem a while before the Fire to drain. In the mean while prepare for them\r\nthe following Sauce of burnt or brown Butter, seasoned with Sweet-herbs,\r\nSalt, Pepper, Nutmeg, and a little Elder-Vinegar, with some Mushrooms\r\nstew'd and hash'd; and garnish your Dish, or Plate, with fry'd Bread,\r\nParsley, and fry'd Mushrooms.\r\n\r\nThese are a few out of many Receipts, which the above Gentleman gave me,\r\nand may serve as Directions for many others; for by what I can find, all\r\nthe others depend upon the same Principles. The variation of these depends\r\nupon the variety of Tastes: Some like Amletts, or Frazes of Eggs, with\r\nBacon, or with Clary, or other high-tasted Herbs, which every good\r\nHousewife knows how to direct. The same Gentleman observes, that Amletts\r\nwith boiled Artichoke Bottoms sliced, Amletts with the Tops of boil'd\r\nAsparagus, green Pease boiled, Mushrooms stew'd and sliced, or Truffles,\r\nthese he tells me are extraordinary.\r\n\r\nAs to the particulars relating to the dressing of farced Fowls, the methods\r\nwhich most agree with my Palate, and have been admired by the best Judges\r\nof my Acquaintance, are the following, which I had from _France_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo dress a Capon, or other Fowl.\r\n\r\nWhen your Fowl is truss'd for Roasting, cover the Breast with a thin slice\r\nof fat Bacon, and put an Onion stuck with Cloves into the Belly, with some\r\nSalt and Pepper; when it is roasted enough, take off the Bacon, and strew\r\nit with grated Bread, till it is brown. This is eaten, either with\r\nOrange-Juice and Salt, or if Oysters are at hand, as they are about many\r\nFarms in _England_, they may be stew'd gently with a little White Wine,\r\nSpice, and a little Butter, which will make an agreeable Sauce for it. Or\r\nelse it may be eaten with a very good Sauce, which I have often met with,\r\nand have lik'd as well; which is made with small Beer and Water, equal\r\nquantities, an Onion slic'd, some Pepper and Salt, and about an Ounce of\r\nFlesh, either of Mutton or Beef, to boil till it comes to about half,\r\nsupposing at first 'tis not above half a Pint; and at some places, instead\r\nof Mutton, _&c._ this Sauce has been only made of the Neck of a Fowl. This\r\nSauce, in my Opinion, has a very rich Taste, and has been well approv'd of\r\nby some curious Travellers: Where we could have this, we rather chose it\r\nthan Wine-Sauce. Capons, Pullets, or others of this sort of Fowl, may be\r\nalso larded with Bacon, if they are roasted; but the Gentleman aforesaid,\r\nwho gave me this Receipt, told me that no Water-Fowl must be larded with\r\nBacon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo farce or stuff a Fowl. From Mr. _Agneau._\r\n\r\nWhen your Fowl is made ready for Roasting, take the Liver boil'd, a\r\nShallot, a little Fat of Bacon, some grated Bread, the Bottom of a boil'd\r\nArtichoke, and some Mushrooms, chop these very small, and make a forc'd\r\nMeat of them, season'd with Salt and Spices at pleasure; fill the Belly of\r\nthe Fowl with this, and then truss it, covering the Breast with a thin\r\nslice of fat Bacon, and over that put a piece of writing Paper. Roast this,\r\nand serve it up with the following Sauce: Make a hash of Mushrooms, an\r\nAnchovy, a few Capers and some Gravy, boiled together with such Seasoning\r\nas you approve; the Sauce should be thicken'd or brown'd, and it is fit for\r\nthe Table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo farce Fowls another way. From the same.\r\n\r\nTake Pullets and roast them, then take the Flesh of the Breast, and mince\r\nit small, with some Fat of Bacon boil'd, a few Mushrooms, a little Onion\r\nand Parsley, and some Crumb of Bread soak'd in Cream over a gentle Fire;\r\nwhen all these are well minc'd, add the Yolks of two or three Eggs, and mix\r\nall together; then with this forced Meat fill the Breast of the Fowls in\r\ntheir proper shape, and beat some Whites of Eggs to go over them, and then\r\ncover them thick with Crumbs of Bread, having first laid your Fowls\r\ncommodiously in a Dish, and then put them in the Oven till they have taken\r\na fine brown Colour. If you have more of this farced Meat than you use in\r\nmaking good the Fowls, either make it into Balls and fry them, or else make\r\na Batter of Eggs, Milk, and Wheat-Flower, and dip small parcels of the\r\nFarce into it to fry for garnishing. You may make a Sauce to these farced\r\nFowls with stew'd Mushrooms toss'd up with Cream; the same may be done with\r\nTurkeys, Pheasants, _&c_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make a brown or white Fricassee of Chickens. From the same.\r\n\r\nStrip the Chickens of their Skins as soon as they are kill'd, and when they\r\nare drawn, cut their Wings, Legs, and most fleshy parts in Pieces, then fry\r\nthem a little in Hog's-Lard; after which, put them to stew with a little\r\nButter and Gravy, for a brown Fricassee, or Butter and Water for a white\r\nFricassee; to either of these add a Glass of White Wine, with a Seasoning\r\nof Salt, Pepper, Nutmeg, Cherville cut small, and three or four young\r\nOnions whole, that they may be withdrawn when the Fricassee is enough: Then\r\nbrown the Sauce with some of the same Lard the Chickens were fry'd in, and\r\nthicken it with burnt Flower; to this you may add fry'd or stew'd\r\nMushrooms. But for a white Fricassee, instead of the browning with the Lard\r\nand burnt Flower, thicken the Sauces with three or four Yolks of Eggs, and\r\na little Verjuice; or else when the Fricassee is stew'd enough, take off\r\nthe Fat as much as possible, and toss it up with Cream; this will serve to\r\nfricassee Rabbits.\r\n\r\nIn Lent, and on Fast-days, I have eaten very good Soups abroad, that were\r\nmade without any Flesh. And as that is not very common in _England_, I\r\nthought it convenient to bring over the Receipts with me, that we may know\r\nhow to make the best of every thing about a Farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Fish-Gravy for Soups.\r\n\r\nTo make this Fish-Gravy, which may serve for a Foundation of all Fish\r\nSoups, take Tench or Eels, or both, well scour'd from Mud, and their\r\nOutsides scour'd well with Salt; then pull out their Gills, and put them in\r\na Kettle with Water, Salt, a bunch of sweet Herbs, and an Onion stuck with\r\nCloves; boil these an hour and a half, and then strain off the Liquor thro'\r\na Cloth: add to this the Peelings of Mushrooms well wash'd, or Mushrooms\r\nthemselves cut small; boil these together, and strain the Liquor thro' a\r\nSieve into a Stew-Pan, upon some burnt or fry'd Flower, and a little Lemon,\r\nwhich will soon render it of a good Colour, and delicate Flavour, fit for\r\nSoups, which may be varied according to the Palate, by putting in Pot-Herbs\r\nand Spices to every one's liking; this will keep good some time. When you\r\nmake any of this into Soup, remember to put a Glass of white Wine into your\r\nSoup a little before you serve it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Foundation for Herb Soups.\r\n\r\nTake a quantity of good Herbs, such as Cherville, Spinage, Sallery, Leeks,\r\nBeet-Cards, and such like, with two or three large Crusts of Bread, some\r\nButter, a bunch of sweet Herbs, and a little Salt; put these, with a\r\nmoderate quantity of Water, into a Kettle, and boil them an hour and half,\r\nand strain off the Liquor thro' a Sieve, and it will be a good Foundation\r\nfor Soups, either of Asparagus Buds, Lettuce, or any other kind, fit for\r\nLent or Fast-days. These Herb Soups are sometimes strengthened with two or\r\nthree Yolks of Eggs, a little before they are serv'd to the Table.\r\n\r\nAs in this Month there is plenty of Oranges, so it is a proper Season to\r\nmake Orange-Wine, which is a most pleasant and refreshing Liquor in the\r\nSummer Season. The following Receipt is an approved one for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Orange Wine. From Mrs. _E. B._\r\n\r\nTake twenty Gallons of Water, and forty Pounds of fine Sugar, mix these\r\ntogether, boil and clarify it with the Whites of Eggs: against this is\r\ndone, have two hundred middling Oranges, pared so thin that no White appear\r\nupon the Rinds; and as soon as the Syrup is taken off the Fire, put the\r\nPeels of five and twenty Oranges into it; and when the Liquor is quite\r\ncold, put in the Juice of the Oranges, with some fresh Ale-Yeast spread\r\nupon a warm Toast of white Bread; let this work two days, and then put it\r\ninto the Vessel or Cask, adding at the same time, two Gallons of white\r\n_Port_ Wine; and then to every Gallon of Liquor, add an Ounce of Syrup of\r\nCitron, or Syrup of Lemon, and in two Months time it be fit to bottle.\r\n\r\nIn this Month it may not be unneccessary to observe that Oranges are\r\ndeclining, and waste apaces; but they are commonly very cheap, and\r\ntherefore such as have a great Call for Orange-peel, as Confectioners,\r\n_&c._ now buy them in quantities; but a little Carriage by Land will\r\ncontribute to their quicker decay. The Orange, tho' it is not found in\r\nevery Garden, yet I esteem it as a necessary Fruit in many Cases, and what\r\na Family can hardly be without; and truly considering how good Oranges we\r\nmight have in our Gardens, and how easily they may be cultivated against\r\nGarden-walls, I much wonder that they are not more generally planted with\r\nus. There is a very good Instance of their prospering well against a Wall,\r\nand thriving in the natural Ground, at Mr. _Heather_'s, a curious Gentleman\r\nat _Tiwittenham_, which Trees bear very well, and bring very large Fruit.\r\n\r\nBut as I have observ'd above, that this is the Season when foreign Oranges\r\nare generally in the greatest plenty about _London_, it is a good time to\r\npreserve their Juice; especially it may prove useful to such as have\r\nopportunities of vending _Punch_ in large Quantitles, or for such who find\r\nthat Liquor agreeable to them: For tho' I have known several who have\r\nexpress'd the Juice of Oranges and Lemons, and bottled it up against a dear\r\nTime, yet such Juice has turn'd to be of a very disageeable Sourness in a\r\nshort season. The Method which I have taken to preserve this Juice to be\r\nused in Punch, was to express the Juice, and pass it thro' a Jelly-bag,\r\nwith about two Ounces of double-refined Loaf-Sugar to each Pint of Juice,\r\nand a Pint of Brandy, or Arrack; bottle this up, and cork it well with\r\nsound Corks, and you may keep it a Year. Before you pass this Liquor thro'\r\nthe Bag, you may put about the Rind of two Oranges to steep for two Hours,\r\ninto each Quart of Liquor, which will give it a rich Flavour. When you have\r\noccasion to use it for Punch, it is at the discretion of the Maker to add\r\nwhat quantity of Brandy, or Arrack, he thinks proper, only remembring that\r\nthere is already a Pint in each Bottle. This may be of good advantage to\r\nInn-keepers, _&c._ who live remote from _London_; and by this way they need\r\nnot run the hazard of losing this sort of Fruit, by bruising or rotting,\r\nwhich they will be subject to, if they are not well pack'd, and have bad\r\nRoads. And besides, considering the vast difference that there is in the\r\nPrice of Oranges, so much, that at some Seasons you must pay as much for\r\none, as will at another time purchase near a Dozen, it is the best to\r\nconsider of this when they are at the cheapest Price. We may likewise use\r\nthe same Method with Lemons; but it is not convenient to steep any of the\r\nPeels in the Liquor, for they will give it a disagreeable Flavour. But it\r\nis to be understood also, that Lemons are to be met with in perfection all\r\nthe Year; only this Season they are at the cheapest Price. The Peel of an\r\nOrange or two may be put to each Quart of Juice, to steep as above\r\ndirected, bruising every piece of Peel as you put it into the Juice. Note,\r\nthat the Lemon and Orange Juice must not be mix'd together in the same\r\nBottles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMARCH.\r\n\r\nThis Month all sorts of Pond-fish are in Season; _viz._ the Jack, the Carp,\r\nthe Tench, the Perch, and the Eel; but it must be noted, that both the\r\nMales and Females of every kind of Fish are in their greatest Perfection\r\nbefore the Spawning-time, and they are sick and unwholesome for three Weeks\r\nafter Spawning. The Eel, indeed, has not yet been known to lay any Spawn,\r\nbut is likely to be Viviparous, as I have mention'd in the Month of\r\n_January_. The Jack, or Pike, this Month runs, as the Sportsmen call it;\r\nthat is, they retire into the Ditches, if there are any in their way, and\r\nfeed upon Frogs; or else, in warm Days, lie upon the top of the Waters, and\r\nare easily taken by Snares: However, they are this Month full row'd, and\r\nare then in their greatest Strength, and in the best condition for the\r\nTable. We judge those are the best which are broad-back'd, and deep Fish;\r\nfor those that are long and slender, have not their Flesh firm, which is\r\nreckon'd the Perfection of a Fish. The way of preparing this Fish in the\r\nbest manner, in my Opinion, if it is large, is to roast it according to the\r\nfollowing Receipt, which I had from Mr. _John Hughs_, an excellent Cook in\r\n_London_.\r\n\r\nWhen a Jack or Pike is discharged of its Scales and Entrails, and well\r\nclean'd, prepare a Mixture in the following Manner, to be sew'd up in the\r\nBelly of the Fish: Take of grated Bread about one third part, the Rivet, or\r\nLiver of the Fish cut small, with Oysters chopped, or the Flesh of Eels cut\r\nsmall; mix these with three or four Eggs butter'd in a Sauce-pan, to which\r\nadd Pepper and Salt with some dry'd Sweet Marjoram well pouder'd, or such\r\nother Sweet-herbs as are most grateful to the Palate, an Anchovy shred\r\nsmall, and fill the Belly of the Fish with the Preparation, and sew it up.\r\nWhen this is done, cut two small Laths of Willow, or any other Wood, except\r\nDeal, or such as has a Turpentine Juice in it, of the length of the Fish,\r\nand lay the Fish upon the Spit, with the two Laths upon the Fish, and bind\r\nthem together with a Fillet of Linnen, about an Inch wide, which must be\r\nwrapp'd round them in a Screw-like manner, and then laid down to the Fire,\r\nand basted very well with Butter, and drudged with Crumbs of Bread, and the\r\nsame sort of Sweet-herbs that were used in the Mixture abovemention'd.\r\nWhere you have not the conveniency of Oysters, or Eels, to compose the\r\naforemention'd Mixture, you may add a larger quantity of butter'd Eggs.\r\nWhere there is the conveniency of an Oven, we may bake such a Fish with\r\nless trouble than roasting it; and in that case rub the outside with the\r\nYolk of an Egg, and roll it in some of the Mixture abovemention'd, the\r\nAnchovy and butter'd Eggs excepted, putting some Vinegar and Butter in the\r\nPan. The Sauce to this Fish is Butter melted, a little White-wine, and\r\nmix'd with a third part of season'd Beef Gravy, with a Spoonful or two of\r\nMushroom Ketchup, and an Anchovy or two dissolved.\r\n\r\nThe smaller Sort of these Fish, _i.e._ such as are about a Foot long, are\r\nmost commonly boiled, but they will do well baked, as above directed. The\r\nsame Sauce may be used with the boil'd Fish; or instead of Beef Gravy, may\r\nbe used the Mushroom Gravy, as directed in this Work, which will have a\r\nmuch finer Relish than the Beef Gravy.\r\n\r\nIn this Month likewise, the Carp is fit for the Table, and is commonly much\r\nadmir'd, if it be well stew'd; otherwise I think it makes but an\r\nindifferent Dish, being a Fish full of Cross-bones. The Head is accounted\r\nmuch the best part of the Fish, and is therefore presented as a Compliment\r\nto the greatest Stranger at the Table. The Carp, as it is a Fish which\r\nthrives best in black, deep, standing Waters, is therefore commonly given\r\nto taste of the Mud; but to cure this, those Carps you intend for the Table\r\nshould be put into a clear Water for a Week before you use them, that they\r\nmay purge themselves. You may keep two Brace of large Carps well enough in\r\na two-dozen Hamper, plung'd into any part of a River where there is a clear\r\nStream, or Trench that is fed by a Spring, and they will become of an\r\nextraordinary sweet Taste. And so we may do with Tench and Eels, when we\r\ncatch them in foul feeding Waters. When your Fish are thus purify'd, dress\r\nyour Carps after the following manner:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Stew Carps or Tench.\r\n\r\nTake a Brace of live Carp, scale them, gut and wash them, and bleed them in\r\nthe Tails, so that the Blood be not lost; for according to all the Receipts\r\nfor stewing this kind of Fish, the Blood, however small the Quantity is of\r\nit, must make part of the Sauce: Lay these in a Stew-Pan with the Blood, a\r\nPint of Beef-Gravy, a Pint of Claret, a large Onion stuck with Cloves,\r\nthree large Anchovies, a Stick of Horse-radish sliced, the Peel of half a\r\nlarge Lemon, Pepper and Salt at pleasure, a Bunch of Sweet-herbs, two or\r\nthree Spoonfuls of Vinegar. This Liquor should nearly cover the Carps; so\r\nthat if the Gravy and Claret, mention'd above, be not sufficient, add equal\r\nquantities of each till you have enough; cover this close, and set the\r\nStew-pan over a gentle Fire, till the lower-side of the Fish are stew'd\r\nenough; then turn them, and keep them stewing as before, close cover'd,\r\ntill they are enough; after which, lay them in a Dish upon Sippets of fry'd\r\nBread, and strain off the Sauce to be thicken'd and brown'd with burnt\r\nButter. This must be poured over the Fish, and the Dish garnish'd with the\r\nRow or Milt, Barberries, and Lemons sliced.\r\n\r\nThe same Method is also used for stewing of large Roach, Dace, and Chubb;\r\nbut a Tench stew'd this way, is much better than a Carp, The Back of this\r\nFish, and the Head, are the Pieces which are most in esteem.\r\n\r\nIt is worth our remark, that when we find our Tench cover'd with black\r\nScales, they Will always taste muddy, which is the fault of the River-Tench\r\nabout _Cambridge_; but where we find Tench of a golden Colour, we are sure\r\nof good Fish, that will eat sweet without the trouble of putting 'em into\r\nclear Water to purify.\r\n\r\nAs there is some trouble in the dressing of this Fish, they may be stew'd\r\nthe Night before they are to be eaten, and will keep very well; and half an\r\nhour before they are to be serv'd up, set them over the Fire to be\r\nthoroughly hot, and then brown their Sauce as before directed.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observ'd, that to bake these Fish with the above Ingredients is\r\nas good a Way as the stewing them. It is likewise necessary to observe,\r\nthat all Fish which will keep a long time alive out of Water, will sicken,\r\nand their Flesh become unfirm by lying in the Air; therefore, if Fish are\r\nto be sent a Day's Journey, or kept a Day before they are used, kill them\r\nas soon as they are taken out of the Water, and the Flesh will be firm.\r\n\r\nI shall add one thing more concerning the boiling of Fish, which was\r\ncommunicated to me by a very ingenious Gentleman, who has made Fishing his\r\nStudy for many Years: He says, that the Goodness of boil'd Fish consists\r\nchiefly in the Firmness of the Flesh; and in the next place, that the Flesh\r\nparts easily from the Bone; to do which, he directs to kill the Fish\r\nimmediately after they are taken out of the Water; and when you design to\r\nboil 'em, put a large handful of Salt into about two or three quarts of\r\nWater, and so in proportion: Put in the Fish while the Water is cold; then\r\nset them over the Fire, and make them boil as quick as possible, without\r\nany Cover over the Pan. This is approved to do very well. This Receipt is\r\nparticularly good for boiling of Flounders. His Receipt for Sauce for\r\nboil'd Fish, is the following.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSauce for boil'd Fish.\r\n\r\nTake Beef-Gravy, an Onion, a little White-wine, some Horse-radish sliced,\r\nLemon-peel, an Anchovy, a Bunch of Sweet-herbs, boil them well together,\r\nand strain off the Liquor, then put a Spoonful of Mushroom Ketchup to it,\r\nand thicken it with Butter mix'd with Flower: or for Fast-days the Gravy\r\nmay be omitted, and in the place of it put Mushroom-Gravy, or a larger\r\nquantity of Mushroom-Ketchup, or some of the Fish-Gravy mention'd in\r\n_February_, which is good to put in Sauce for any sort of Fish.\r\n\r\nAs this is the Month when Eels begin to be good, I shall give two or three\r\nReceipts for the Dressing of them in the best manner: The first for\r\nRoasting of Eels, or Pitchcotting them, I had from the Crown at\r\n_Basingstoke_ some Years ago; and that for Collaring of Eels, from Mr.\r\n_John Hughs_, a celebrated Cook in _London_. But I shall first observe,\r\nthat the Silver Eel is counted the best; and that all such as lie and feed\r\nin clear Streams, may be used without purging them, as I have directed\r\nabove; but all Pond Eels must be put into clear Waters for a Week, at\r\nleast, before they are used, if you would have them in perfection. And now\r\nto the Receipts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Roast or Broil an Eel, from the _Crown_ at _Basingstoke, An. 1718._\r\n\r\nTake a large Eel, rub the Skin well with Salt, then gut it and wash it\r\nwell; cut off the Head and skin it, laying by the Skin in Water and Salt;\r\nthen lay your Eel in a clean Dish, and pour out about a Pint of Vinegar\r\nupon it, letting it remain in the Vinegar near an hour; then withdraw your\r\nEel from the Vinegar, and make several Incisions at proper distances in the\r\nFlesh of the Back and Sides, which Spaces must be fill'd with the following\r\nMixture:\r\n\r\nTake grated Bread, the Yolks of two or three hard Eggs, one Anchovy minced\r\nsmall, some Sweet-Marjoram dry'd and pouder'd; or for want of that, some\r\nGreen Marjoram shred small: to this add Pepper, Salt, a little Pouder of\r\nCloves, or _Jamaica_ Pepper, and a little fresh Butter, to be beat all\r\ntogether in a Stone Mortar, till it becomes like a Paste; with which\r\nMixture fill all the Incisions that you cut in the Eel, and draw the Skin\r\nover it: then tie the end of the Skin next the Head, and prick it with a\r\nFork in several Places; then tie it to a Spit to roast, or lay it upon a\r\nGrid-iron to broil, without basting. The Sauce for this is Butter, Anchovy,\r\na little Pepper, and Lemon-juice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Pitchcot Eels.\r\n\r\nTake a large Eel, clean well with Salt and Water both the Skin and the\r\nInside, then pull off the Skin, and prepare the following Mixture of Bread\r\ngrated, Sweet-herbs pouder'd, or minced small, such as Sweet-marjoram,\r\nSage, and some Pepper and Salt; then rub your Eel with Yolks of Eggs, and\r\nafter that, roll it in the Mixture, then draw the Skin over it, and cut\r\nyour Eel in several pieces about three Inches in length, dipping them again\r\nin Yolks of Eggs, and after that, in the above Mixture: then lay them on\r\nthe Gridiron, and when they are enough, serve them to the Table, with the\r\nSauce prescribed for the roasted Eels, abovemention'd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Collar Eels, from Mr. _John Hughs,_ a famous Cook in _London._\r\n\r\nTake a large Eel, and scour the Skin and the Inside very well with Salt,\r\ncut off the Head, and split it down the Back, then lay it abroad upon your\r\nDresser, and season it well with Spice, Salt, and a good quantity of Red\r\nSage minced small: mix these well, and sprinkle the Mixture thick upon your\r\nEel, then roll it up, and tye it close in a thin Cloth at each end, and in\r\nthe middle; boil it then in a strong Pickle of Vinegar, Water, Salt, some\r\nSpice, and a Bay-leaf or two; and when it is boiled enough, take out the\r\nEel, and let it stand till it is quite cold, and when the Pickle is cold\r\nlikewise, pour the Pickle into a glazed Earthen-Pan, and put your Eel into\r\nit to keep for Use; this will remain good several Weeks, if it is kept\r\nclose cover'd. When the Eel is quite cold, take off the Cloth.\r\n\r\nThe Eel is also good in Pyes, fry'd and boil'd, which every one knows how\r\nto prepare.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of this Month, the Trout begins to come in Season; for before\r\nthis time, its Body is cover'd with little Insects, which is a\r\nDemonstration of its being sick and unwholesome. The best way of eating\r\nthis Fish is to boil it, and serve it with Butter and an Anchovy for Sauce;\r\nas is commonly practis'd about _Hungerford, Spenham-Land_, and other noted\r\nPlaces for Trout.\r\n\r\nIf the Season is now mild, about the end of the Month the Sap in the\r\nBirch-Tree will begin to be very fluent. And so in the Choice of Fish to be\r\nseasonable, we must have regard to the Temper of the Air; for if the Air be\r\nmild and gentle, sooner or later all parts of the Creation are govern'd by\r\nit: but when I direct for this Month or another any thing to be done, I\r\nsuppose the Temper of the Air to be what it is for the generality; but the\r\nBirch-Tree Sap we will suppose begins now to flow, and then we are to take\r\nthe opportunity of making Wine of it. The best Receipt I have met with for\r\nmaking this Wine, is the following.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Birch-Wine. From Lady _W._\r\n\r\nWhen the Sap of the Birch-Tree will run, cut a large Notch in the Bark of\r\nthe Trunk of the Tree, in such a place as one may conveniently place a\r\nVessel to receive the Sap; which Will flow at the Incision very\r\nplentifully, without doing any harm to the Tree. If the Trees are pretty\r\nlarge, you may expect about a Gallon of Liquor from each of them, which\r\nmust be order'd in the following manner. Take five Gallons of the Liquor,\r\nto which put five Pounds of Powder-Sugar, and two Pounds of Raisins of the\r\nSun stoned; to this, put the Peel of one large Lemon, and about forty large\r\nfresh Cloves: boil all these together, taking off the Scum carefully as it\r\nrises; then pour it off into some Vessel to cool, and as soon as it is cool\r\nenough to put Yeast to it, work it as you would do Ale for two days, and\r\nthen tunn it, taking care not to stop the Vessel till it has done Working,\r\nand in a Month's time it will be ready to bottle. This is not only a very\r\nPleasant, but a very Wholesome Wine.\r\n\r\nThis Month is esteemed one of the principal Seasons for brewing of Malt\r\nLiquors for long keeping; the Reason is, because the Air at this time of\r\nthe Year is temperate, and contributes to the good Working or Fermenting\r\nthe Drink, which chiefly promotes its Preservation and good Keeping: for\r\nvery cold Weather prevents the free Fermentation or Working of Liquors, as\r\nwell as very hot Weather; so that if we brew in very cold Weather, unless\r\nwe use some Means to warm the Cellar while new Drink is Working, it will\r\nnever clear itself as it ought to do; and the same Misfortune will it lie\r\nunder, if in very hot Weather the Cellar is not put in a temperate state,\r\nthe Consequence of which will be, that such Drink will be Muddy and Sour,\r\nand, perhaps, never recover; or if it does, perhaps not under two or three\r\nYears. Again, such Misfortunes are often owing to the badness of the\r\nCellars; for where they are dug in springy Ground, or are subject to Wet in\r\nthe Winter, then the Drink will chill, and grow flat and dead. But where\r\nCellars are of this sort, it is adviseable to make your great Brewings in\r\nthis Month rather than in _October_; for you may keep such Cellars\r\ntemperate in Summer, but cannot warm them in Winter, and so your Drink\r\nbrew'd in _March_ will have due time to settle and adjust itself before the\r\nCold can do it any great harm. It is adviseable likewise to build your\r\nCellars for keeping of Drink, after such a manner, that none of the\r\nexternal Air may come into them; for the variation of the Air abroad, was\r\nthere free admission of it into the Cellars, would cause as many\r\nAlterations in the Liquors, and so would keep them perpetually disturb'd\r\nand unfit for drinking. I know some curious Gentlemen in these things, that\r\nkeep double Doors to their Cellars, on purpose that none of the outward Air\r\nmay get into them, and they have good reason to boast of their\r\nMalt-Liquors. The meaning of the double Doors, is to keep one shut while\r\nthe other is open, that the outward Air may be excluded; such Cellars, if\r\nthey lie dry, as they ought to do, are said to be cool in Summer, and warm\r\nin Winter, tho' in reality, they are constantly the same in point of\r\nTemper: they seem indeed cool in hot Weather, but that is because we come\r\ninto them from an hotter abroad; and so they seem to us warm in Winter,\r\nbecause we come out of a colder Air to them; so that they are only cold or\r\nwarm comparatively, as the Air we come out of is hotter or colder. This is\r\nthe Cafe, and a Cellar should be thus dispos'd if we expect to have good\r\nDrink. As for the Brewing Part itself, I shall leave that to the Brewers in\r\nthe several Counties in _England_, who have most of them different Manners\r\neven of Brewing honestly. What I shall chiefly touch upon, besides what I\r\nshall speak of Cellaring, will relate to Water, Malt, Hops, and the keeping\r\nLiquors.\r\n\r\nThe best Water, to speak in general, is River Water, such as is soft, and\r\nhas partook of the Air and Sun; for this easily insinuates itself into the\r\nMalt, and extracts its Virtue; whereas the hard Waters astringe and bind\r\nthe Parts of the Malt, so that its Virtue is not freely communicated to the\r\nLiquor. It is a Rule with a Friend of mine, that all Water which will mix\r\nwith Soap is fit for Brewing, and he will by no means allow of any other;\r\nand I have more than once experienc'd, that where the same Quantity of Malt\r\nhas been used to a Barrel of River Water, and the same to a Barrel of\r\nSpring Water, the River Water Brewing has excell'd the other in Strength\r\nabove five degrees in twelve Months, as I prov'd by a small Glass-Tube with\r\na Seal, and was much preferable to the Taste, I must observe too, that the\r\nMalt was not only in Quantity the same for one Barrel as for another, but\r\nwas the same in Quality, having been all measur'd from the same Heap; so\r\nalso the Hops were the same both in Quality and Quantity, and the Time of\r\nboiling, and both work'd in the same manner, and tunn'd and kept in the\r\nsame Cellar. Here it was plain that there was no difference but the Water,\r\nand yet one Barrel was worth two of the other.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing which has long puzzled the best Brewers, which I shall\r\nhere endeavour to explain; and that is, where several Gentlemen in the same\r\nTown have employ'd the same Brewer, have had the same Malt, the same Hops,\r\nand the same Water too, and brew'd all in the same Month, and broach'd\r\ntheir Drink at the same time; and yet one has had Beer which has been\r\nextremely fine, strong, and well tasted, while the others have hardly had\r\nany worth drinking. I conjecture there may be three Reasons for this\r\ndifference: One may be the different Weather which might happen at the\r\ndifferent Brewings in this Month, which might make an Alteration in the\r\nWorking of the Liquors: Or, secondly, that the Yeast or Barm might be of\r\ndifferent sorts, or in different states, wherewith these Liquors were\r\nWork'd: And, thirdly, that the Cellars were not equally good: for I am very\r\nsensible, the goodness of such Drink, as is brew'd for keeping, depends\r\nupon the goodness of the Cellars where it is kept; for at a Gentleman's of\r\nmy Acquaintance, who for many Years has used the same Brewer, and the same\r\nMethod, his Beer is always of the same Taste, his Cellars, or Vaults, are\r\nvery dry, and have two or three Doors to them.\r\n\r\nThe _Dorchester_ Beer, which is esteem'd preferable to most of the\r\nMalt-Liquor in _England,_ is for the most part brew'd of chalky Water,\r\nwhich is almost every where in that County; and as the Soil is generally\r\nChalk there, I am of opinion, that the Cellars being dug in that dry Soil\r\ncontributes to the good keeping of their Drink, it being of a close\r\ntexture, and of a drying quality, so as to dissipate Damps; for damp\r\nCellars, we find by experience, are injurious to keeping Liquors, as well\r\nas destructive to the Casks. The Malt of this Country is of a pale Colour;\r\nand the best Drink of this County that I have met with to be sold, is at a\r\nsmall House against the Church at _Blackwater,_ four Miles beyond\r\n_Dorchester_, in the Road to _Bridport_, in _Dorsetshire_; they broach no\r\nBeer till it is a Year old, and has had time to mellow. But there must be\r\nsuch Cellars as I speak of, which inclose a temperate Air, to ripen Drink\r\nin; the constant temperate Air digests and softens these Malt Liquors, so\r\nthat they drink smooth as Oil; but in the Cellars which are unequal, by\r\nletting in Heats and Colds, the Drink is subject to grow stale and sharp:\r\nFor this reason it is, that Drink, which is brew'd for a long Voyage at\r\nSea, should be perfectly ripe and fine before it is exported, for when it\r\nhas had sufficient time to digest in the Cask, and is rack'd from the\r\nBottom or Lee, it will bear carriage without injury. It is farther to be\r\nnoted, that in proportion to the quantity of Liquor, which is enclosed in\r\none Cask, so will it be a longer or a shorter time in ripening. A Vessel\r\nwhich will contain two Hogsheads of Beer, will require twice as much time\r\nto perfect itself as one of a Hogshead; and from my experience I find there\r\nshould be no Vessel used for strong Beer, which we design to keep, less\r\nthan a Hogshead: for one of that quantity, if it be fit to draw in a Year,\r\nhas Body enough to support it two, or three, or four Years, if it has\r\nstrength of Malt and Hops in it, as the _Dorseshire_ Beer has; and this\r\nwill bear the Sea very well, as we find every day.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing more to be consider'd in the preservation of Beer; and\r\nthat is, when once the Vessel is broach'd, we ought to have regard to the\r\ntime in which it will be expended: for if there happens to be a quick\r\nDraught for it, then it will last good to the very bottom; but if there is\r\nlikely to be a slow draught, then do not draw off quite half, before you\r\nbottle it, or else your Beer will grow flat, dead, or sour. This is\r\nobserved very much among the Curious.\r\n\r\nOne great piece of Oeconomy is the good management of Small Beer; for if\r\nthat is not good, the Drinkers of it will be feeble in Summer-time, and\r\nincapable of strong Work, and will be very subject to Distempers; and\r\nbesides, when Drink is not good, a great deal will be thrown away. The use\r\nof Drink, as well as Meat, is to nourish the Body; and the more Labour\r\nthere is upon any one, the more substantial should be the Dyet. In the time\r\nof Harvest I have often seen the bad Effects of bad Small Beer among the\r\nWorkmen; and in great Families, where that Article has not been taken care\r\nof, the Apothecaries Bills have amounted to twice as much more as the Malt\r\nwould have come to, that would have kept the Servants in strength and good\r\nhealth; besides one thing more, which I observed above, good wholesome\r\nDrink is seldom flung away by Servants, so that the sparing of a little\r\nMalt ends in loss to the Master. Where there is good Cellaring, therefore,\r\nit is adviseable to brew a flock of Small Beer, either in this Month or\r\n_October_, or in both Months, and to be kept in Hogsheads, if possible: The\r\nBeer brew'd in _March_ to begin drawing in _October_, and that brew'd in\r\n_October_ to begin in _March_, for Summer drinking; having this regard to\r\nthe quantity, that a Family of the same number of working Persons, will\r\ndrink a third more in Summer than in Winter,\r\n\r\nIf Water happens to be of a hard nature, it may be softened by setting it\r\nexposed to the Air and Sun, and putting into it some Pieces of soft Chalk\r\nto infuse; or else when the Water is set on to boil, for pouring upon the\r\nMalt, put into it a quantity of Bran, which will help a little to soften\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI shall now mention two or three Particulars relating to Malt, which may\r\nhelp those who are unacquainted with brewing: In the first place, the\r\ngeneral Distinctions, between one Malt and another, is only that one is\r\nhigh dried, the other low dried; that which we call high dried, will, by\r\nbrewing, produce a Liquor of a brown, deep Colour; and the other, which is\r\nthe low dried, will give us a Liquor of a pale Colour. The first is dried\r\nin such a manner, as may be said rather to be scorch'd than dried, and will\r\npromote the Gravel and Stone, and is much less nourishing than the low\r\ndried, or pale Malt, as they call it; for all Corn in the most simple way\r\nis the most feeding to the Body. I have experienc'd too, that the brown\r\nMalt, even tho' it be well brewed, will sooner turn sharp than the pale\r\nMalt, if that be fairly brewed. I am told, that a Gentleman in\r\n_Northamptonshire_ has dried Malt upon the Leads of a House, and has made\r\nvery good Drink of it: And the Method of drying Malt by hot Air, which was\r\nonce proposed to the Publick, will do very well for a small quantity, but\r\n'tis much too tedious to be ever rendered profitable; however, any means\r\nthat can be used to dry Malt without parching of it, will certainly\r\ncontribute to the goodness of the Malt. At the _Greyhound_ at _Marlborough_\r\nI have drank of the palest-colour'd Ale I ever saw, and the best tasted,\r\nand the strongest that I have met with. In that place they dry their Malt\r\nvery tenderly, and brew with chalky Water, and their Cellars are dug in\r\nChalk: So at the _Crown_ at _Hockrell_ near _Bishop-Starford_ in\r\n_Hertfordshire_, is excellent Beer of a pale Colour, strong, and well\r\ntasted; there the Malt is tenderly dried and the Soil chalky: likewise at\r\n_Nottingham_ and _Derby_ they brew with pale Malt, chalky Water, and their\r\nCellars are dug in Chalk.\r\n\r\nThese Places are noted for the Goodness of their Ale all over _England_,\r\ninsomuch that it has been computed, that there has been above two Hundred\r\nThousand Pounds worth of Ale sold in and about _London,_ under the\r\nDenomination of _Nottingham, Derby, Dorchester,_ _&c._ in one Year's time:\r\nbut it is not in _London_ that we must expect to taste these Liquors in\r\nperfection; for it is rare to find any of them there without being\r\nadulterated, or else such Liquors are sold for them as are unskilful\r\nImitations of them; and I may add, are unwholesome into the bargain. While\r\nI am writing this, a Gentleman of good Judgment in this Affair informs me,\r\nthat the Brown Malt he finds makes the best Drink, when it is brew'd with a\r\ncoarse River Water, such as that of the River _Thames_ about _London_; and\r\nthat likewise being brew'd with such Water, it makes very good Ale: but\r\nthat it will not keep above six Months, without turning stale, and a little\r\nsharp, even tho' he allows fourteen Bushels to the Hogshead. He adds, that\r\nhe has try'd the high-dry'd Malt to brew Beer with for keeping, and hopp'd\r\nit accordingly; and yet he could never brew it so as to drink soft and\r\nmellow, like that brew'd with Pale Malt. There is an acid Quality in the\r\nhigh-dry'd Malt, which occasions that Distemper commonly called the\r\nHeart-burn, in those that drink of the Ale or Beer made of it. When I\r\nmention Malt, in what I have already said above, I mean only Malt made of\r\nBarley; for Wheat-malt, Pea-malt, or these mix'd with Barley-malt, tho'\r\nthey produce a high-colour'd Liquor, will keep many Years, and drink soft\r\nand smooth; but then they have the Mum-Flavour. I have known some People,\r\nwho used brewing with high dry'd Barley-malt, to put a Bag, containing\r\nabout three Pints of Wheat, into every Hogshead of Drink, and that has\r\nfined it, and made it to drink mellow: others I have seen put about three\r\nPints of Wheat-malt into a Hogshead, which has produced the same Effect.\r\nBut all Malt-Liquors, however they may be well-brew'd, may be spoiled by\r\nbad Cellaring, and be now and then subject to ferment in the Cask, and\r\nconsequently turn thick and sour. The best way to help this, and bring the\r\nDrink to it self is to open the Bung of the Cask for two or three Days, and\r\nif that does not stop the Fermentation, then put about two or three Pounds\r\nof Oyster-shells wash'd and dry'd well in an Oven, and then beaten to fine\r\nPouder, and stirring it a little, it will presently settle the Drink, make\r\nit fine, and take off the sharp Taste of it; and as soon as that is done,\r\ndraw it off into another Vessel, and put a small Bag of Wheat or Wheat-malt\r\ninto it, as above directed, or in proportion, as the Vessel is larger or\r\nsmaller.\r\n\r\nSometimes such Fermentations will happen in Drink, by change of Weather, if\r\nit is in a bad Cellar, and it will in a few Months fall fine of it self,\r\nand grow mellow.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, that high-dry'd Malt should not be used in Brewing till\r\nit has been ground ten Days, or a Fortnight, it yields much stronger Drink\r\nthan the same quantity of Malt fresh ground; but if you design to keep Malt\r\nsome time ground before you use it, you must take care to keep it very dry,\r\nand the Air at that time should likewise be dry. And as for Pale Malt,\r\nwhich has not partaken so much of the Fire, it must not remain ground above\r\na Week before you use it.\r\n\r\nAs for Hops, the newest are much the best, tho' they will remain very good\r\ntwo Years; but after that, they begin to decay, and lose their good Flavour\r\nunless great Quantities have been kept together; for in that case they Will\r\nkeep much longer good than in small Quantities. These, for their better\r\npreservation, should be kept in a very dry Place, tho' the Dealers in them\r\nrather chuse such Places as are moderately between moist and dry, that they\r\nmay not lose of their Weight. I cannot help taking notice here of a Method\r\nwhich was used to some stale and decay'd Hops the last Year 1725, to make\r\nthem recover their Bitterness; which was to unbag them, and sprinkle them\r\nwith Aloes and Water, which, together with the badness of the Malt of the\r\nsame Year's growth, spoil'd great quantities of Drink about _London_; for\r\neven where the Water, the Malt, and the Brewer, and Cellars are good, a bad\r\nHop will spoil all: So that every one of these Particulars should be\r\nwell-chosen before the Brewing is set about, or else we must expect but a\r\nbad Account of our Labour. And so likewise the Yeast or Barm that you work\r\nyour Drink with, must be well consider'd, or a good Brewing may be spoil'd\r\nby that alone; and be sure that be always provided before you begin\r\nBrewing, for your Wort will not stay for it.\r\n\r\nIn some remote Places from Towns it is practised to dip Whisks into Yeast,\r\nand beat it well, and so hang up the Whisks with the Yeast in them to dry;\r\nand if there is no Brewing till two Months afterwards, the beating and\r\nstirring one of these Whisks in New Wort, will raise a Working or\r\nFermentation in it. It is a Rule that all Drink should be work'd well in\r\nthe Tun, or Keel, before it be put in the Vessel, for else it will not\r\neasily grow fine. Some follow the Rule of beating down the Yeast pretty\r\noften while it is in the Tun, and keep it there working for two or three\r\nDays, observing to put it in the Vessel just when the Yeast begins to fall.\r\nThis Drink is commonly very fine; whereas that, which is put into the\r\nVessel quickly after 'tis brew'd, will not be fine in many Months.\r\n\r\nWe may yet observe, that with relation to the Season for brewing of Drink\r\nfor keeping, if the Cellars are subject to the Heat of the Sun, or warm\r\nSummer Air, it is best to brew in _October_, that the Drink may have time\r\nto digest before the warm Season comes on: And if Cellars are inclinable to\r\nDamps, and to receive Water, the best time is to brew in _March_, and I\r\nknow some experienced Brewers, who always chuse the brewing of Pale Malt in\r\n_March_, and the Brown in _October_; for they guess that the Pale Malt,\r\nbeing made with a lesser degree of Fire than the other, wants the Summer\r\nSeason to ripen in; and so on the contrary, the Brown having had a larger\r\nshare of the Fire to dry it, is more capable of defending itself against\r\nthe Cold of the Winter-Season. But how far these Reasons may be just, I\r\nshall not pretend to determine; but in such a Work as this, nothing should\r\nbe omitted that may contribute to give the least Hint towards meliorating\r\nso valuable a Manufacture; the Artists in the Brewing Way are at liberty to\r\njudge as they please.\r\n\r\nBut when we have been careful in all the above Particulars, if the Casks\r\nare not in good order, still the Brewing may be spoil'd. New Casks are apt\r\nto give Drink an ill Taste, if they are not well scalded and season'd\r\nseveral days successively, before they are put in use; and for old Casks,\r\nif they stand any time out of use, they are apt to grow musty: unslack'd\r\nLime, about a Gallon to a Hogshead, with about six Gallons of Water put in\r\nwith it, and the Hogshead presently stopp'd up, will clear it of its Taint,\r\nif the same be repeated four or five times; or burning of Linnen dipp'd in\r\nBrimstone, to be close stopped in a Cask, three or four times repeated,\r\nwill do the same: or else put Water in your Vessels, and throw in some\r\nburning Coals, and stop them close, will do the like, if it be often\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nI have now but little more to say about the Management of Drink, and that\r\nis concerning the Bottling of it. The Bottles first must be well clean'd\r\nand dry'd; for wet Bottles will make the Drink turn mouldy, or motherry, as\r\nthey call it; and by wet Bottles, many Vessels of good Drink are spoiled:\r\nbut if the Bottles are clean and dry, yet if the Corks are not new and\r\nfound, the Drink is still liable to be damaged; for if the Air can get into\r\nthe Bottles, the Drink will grow flat, and will never rise. I have known\r\nmany who have flatter'd themselves that they knew how to be saving, and\r\nhave used old Corks on this occasion, that have spoiled as much Liquor as\r\nhas stood them in four or five Pounds, only for want of laying out three or\r\nfour Shillings. If Bottles are cork'd as they should be, it is hard to pull\r\nout the Corks without a Screw, and to be sure to draw the Cork without\r\nbreaking, the Screw ought to go through the Cork, and then the Air must\r\nnecessarily find a Passage where the Screw has pass'd, and therefore the\r\nCork is good for nothing; or if a Cork has once been in a Bottle, and has\r\nbeen drawn without a Screw, yet that Cork will turn musty as soon as it is\r\nexposed to the Air, and will communicate its ill Flavour to the Bottle\r\nwhere it is next put, and spoil the Drink that way.\r\n\r\nIn the choice of Corks, chuse those that are soft, and clear from Specks,\r\nand lay them in Water a day or two before you use them; but let them dry\r\nagain before you put them in the Bottles, lest they should happen to turn\r\nmouldy: with this care you may make good Drink, and preserve it to answer\r\nyour expectation.\r\n\r\nIn the bottling of Drink, you may also observe, that the top and middle of\r\nthe Hogshead is the strongest, and will sooner rise in the Bottles than the\r\nbottom: And when once you begin to bottle a Vessel of any Liquor, be sure\r\nnot to leave it till all is complcated, for else you will have some of one\r\nTaste, and some of another.\r\n\r\nIf you find that a Vessel of Drink begins to grow flat, whilst it is in\r\ncommon draught, bottle it, and into every Bottle put a piece of Loaf-Sugar,\r\nabout the quantity of a Walnut, which will make the Drink rise and come to\r\nitself: and to forward its ripening, you may set some Bottles in Hay in a\r\nwarm Place; but Straw will not assist its ripening.\r\n\r\nWhere there are not good Cellars, I have known Holes sunk in the Ground,\r\nand large Oil Jars put into them, and the Earth filled close about the\r\nsides: One of these Jars may hold about a dozen quart Bottles, and will\r\nkeep the Drink very well; but the tops of the Jars must be kept close\r\ncover'd up. And in Winter time, when the Weather is frosty, shut up all the\r\nLights or Windows into such Cellars, and cover them close with fresh\r\nHorse-Dung, or Horse-Litter; but 'tis much better to have no Lights or\r\nWindows at all to any Cellar, for the reasons I have given above.\r\n\r\nIf there has been opportunity of brewing a good stock of Small Beer in\r\n_March_ and _October_, some of it may be bottled at six Months end, putting\r\ninto every Bottle a lump of Loaf-Sugar as big as a Walnut; this especially\r\nwill be very refreshing Drink in the Summer: Or if you happen to brew in\r\nSummer, and are desirous of brisk Small Beer, bottle it, as above, as soon\r\nas it has done working.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAPRIL.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of this Month the Perch is in great Perfection, and\r\nholds good till Winter. One of the ways of dressing this Fish, according to\r\nthe _Hollanders_, and which is much admired by Travellers, is after the\r\nfollowing manner, and is called _Water-Soochy_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make a Water-Soochy.\r\n\r\nTake Perch about five Inches long, scale and clean them well; then lay them\r\nin a Dish, and pour Vinegar upon them, and let them lie an Hour in it;\r\nafter which put them into a Skillet with Water and Salt, some Parsley\r\nLeaves and Parsley-Roots well wash'd and scraped: let these boil over a\r\nquick Fire till they are enough, and then pour the Fish, Roots, and Water\r\ninto a Soop-Dish, and serve them up hot with a Garnish about the Dish of\r\nLemon, sliced. These Fish and Roots are commonly eaten with Bread and\r\nButter in _Holland_, or there may be melted Butter in a little Bason for\r\nthose who chuse it. It is to be noted, that the Parsley-Roots must be taken\r\nbefore they run to Seed; and if they happen to be very large, they should\r\nbe boiled by themselves, for they will require more boiling than the Fish,\r\nThis I had from Mr. _Rozelli_ at the _Hague_.\r\n\r\nThe following Receipt for dressing of Perch, I had likewise from the same\r\nPerson, and is an excellent Dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo prepare Perch with Mushrooms.\r\n\r\nPick, and clean, and cut your Mushrooms into small pieces, and put them in\r\na Saucepan to stew tender without any Liquor, but what will come from them;\r\nthen pour off their Liquor, and put a little Cream to them; having ready at\r\nthe same time a Brace of large Perch well scaled, wash'd, and cut in\r\nFillets or thick Slices, and parboil'd: Put your Perch thus prepared to\r\nyour Mushrooms, and with them the Yolks of three Eggs beaten, some Parsley\r\nboil'd and cut small, some Nutmeg grated, a little Salt, and a little\r\nLemon-Juice: keep all these stirring gently over a slow Fire, taking care\r\nnot to break your Fish; and when they are enough, garnish them with Slices\r\nof Lemon and pickled Barberries.\r\n\r\nThe following general Sauce I had from the same Person; it is always ready\r\nto be used with every kind of Flesh, Fowl, or Fish that require rich\r\nSauces, and will keep good twelve Months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Travelling Sauce.\r\n\r\nTake two Quarts of Claret, a quarter of a Pint of Vinegar, and as much\r\nVerjuice; put these together in a new Stone-Jar that will admit of being\r\nstopp'd close: Put to this a quarter of a Pound of Salt that has been well\r\ndry'd over the Fire, an Ounce of Black-Pepper, a Drachm of Nutmeg beaten\r\nfine, and as much Cloves, a Scruple of Ginger, two or three little Bits of\r\ndry'd Orange-Peel, half an Ounce of Mustard-Seed bruised, half a dozen\r\nShallots bruised a little, five or six Bay-Leaves, a little Sprig of Sweet\r\nBasil, or Sweet Marjoram, a Sprig of Thyme, and a little Cinnamon; then\r\nstop your Jar close, and let the Mixture infuse for twenty-four Hours upon\r\nhot Embers: when this is done, strain your Composition through a Linnen\r\nCloth, till you have express'd as much Liquor as possible, and put it in a\r\ndry Stone Bottle or Jar, and stop it close as soon as 'tis cold. You must\r\nkeep this in a dry Place, and it will remain good twelve Months. This is a\r\ngood Companion for Travellers, who more frequently find good Meat than good\r\nCooks. My Author adds, that those who are Admirers of the Taste of Garlick,\r\nmay add it to this Sauce, or diminish, or leave cut any particular\r\nIngredient that they do not approve of. It may also be made of Water only,\r\nor of Verjuice, or of Wine, or of Orange or Lemon-Juice; but if it is made\r\nof Water, it will keep but a Month good: if it be made of Verjuice, it will\r\nlast good three Months; if we make it of Vinegar, it will last a Year; or\r\nof Wine, it will last as long. Use a little of this at a time, stirring it\r\nwell when you use it.\r\n\r\nIn this Month I likewise judge it will be a good Season to make the\r\nfollowing curious Preparation for the use of Gentlemen that travel; the use\r\nof which I esteem to be of extraordinary Service to such as travel in wild\r\nand open Countries, where few or no Provisions are to be met with; and it\r\nwill be of no less Benefit to such Families as have not immediate Recourse\r\nto Markets, for the Readiness of it for making of Soups, or its Use where\r\nGravey is required: and particularly to those that travel, the lightness of\r\nits Carriage, the small room it takes up, and the easy way of putting it in\r\nuse, renders it extremely serviceable. This is what one may call Veal-Glue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Veal-Glue, or Cake-Soup, to be carried in the Pocket.\r\n\r\nTake a Leg of Veal, strip it of the Skin and the Fat, then take all the\r\nMuscular or Fleshy Parts from the Bones; boil this Flesh gently in such a\r\nquantity of Water, and so long a time, till the Liquor will make a strong\r\nJelly when 'tis cold: this you may try by taking out a small Spoonful now\r\nand then, and letting it cool. Here it is to be supposed, that tho' it will\r\njelly presently in small quantities, yet all the juice of the Meat may not\r\nbe extracted, however, when you find it very strong, strain the Liquor\r\nthro' a Sieve, and let it settle; then provide a large Stew-pan with Water,\r\nand some China-Cups, or glazed Earthen-Ware; fill these Cups with the Jelly\r\ntaken clear from the Settling, and set them in the Stew-pan of Water, and\r\nlet the Water boil gently till the Jelly becomes thick as Glue: after\r\nwhich, let them stand to cool, and then turn out the Glue upon a piece of\r\nnew Flannel, which will draw out the Moisture; turn them in six or eight\r\nHours, and put them upon a fresh Flannel, and so continue to do till they\r\nare quite dry, and keep it in a dry warm Place: this will harden so much,\r\nthat it will be stiff and hard as Glue in a little time, and may be carry'd\r\nin the Pocket without Inconvenience. We are to use this by boiling about a\r\nPint of Water, and pouring it upon a piece of the Glue or Cake, of the\r\nbigness of a small Walnut, and stirring it with a Spoon till the Cake\r\ndissolves, which will make very strong good Broth. As for the Seasoning\r\nPart, every one may add Pepper and Salt as they please, for there must be\r\nnothing of that kind put among the Veal when we make the Glue, for any\r\nthing of that sort would make it mouldy. Some of this sort of Cake-Gravey\r\nhas lately been sold, as I am inform'd, at some of the Taverns near\r\n_Temple-Bar_, where, I suppose, it may now be had. As I have observ'd\r\nabove, that there is nothing of Seasoning in this Soup, so there may be\r\nalways added what we desire, either of Spices or Herbs, to make it savoury\r\nto the Palate; but it must be noted, that all the Herbs that are used on\r\nthis occasion, must be boiled tender in plain Water, and that Water must be\r\nused to pour upon the Cake Gravey instead of simple Water: so may a Dish of\r\ngood Soup be made without trouble, only allowing the Proportion of\r\nCake-Gravey answering to the abovesaid Direction. Or if Gravey be wanted\r\nfor Sauce, double the Quantity may be used that is prescribed for Broth or\r\nSoup. I am inform'd by a Person of Honour, that upon this Foundation, there\r\nhas been made a Cake-Gravey of Beef, which for high Sauces and strong\r\nStomachs, is still of good use; and therefore I shall here give the Method\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Cake-Soup of Beef, &c.\r\n\r\nTake a Leg, or what they call in some Places a Shin of Beef, prepare it as\r\nprescribed above for the Leg of Veal, and use the muscular Parts only, as\r\ndirected in the foregoing Receipt; do every thing as abovemention'd, and\r\nyou will have a Beef-Glue, which, for Sauces, may be more desirable in a\r\nCountry-House, as Beef is of the strongest nature of any Flesh. Some\r\nprescribe to add to the Flesh of the Leg of Beef, the Flesh of two old\r\nHares, and of old Cocks to strengthen it the more; this may be done at\r\npleasure, but the Foundation of all these Cake Graveys or Glues is the\r\nfirst. These indeed are good for Soups and Sauces, and may be enrich'd by\r\nCellary, Cherville, beat Chards, Leeks, or other Soup-Herbs. A little of\r\nthis is also good to put into Sauces, either of Flesh, Fish, or Fowl, and\r\nwill make a fine mixture with the Travelling Sauce. So that whenever there\r\nis mentioned the Use of Gravey in any of the Receipts contained in this\r\nTreatise, this may be used on Feast-days, and the Mushroom Gravey, or\r\nTravelling Sauce on Fast-days.\r\n\r\nThis is also a time of the Year when potted Meats begin to come in fashion;\r\nto do which, the following Receipt may be an Example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo pot a Leg of Beef to imitate potted Venison, from Col. _Bradbury_ of\r\n_Wicken-Hall._\r\n\r\nProvide a Leg of Beef, and take off the Skin as whole as you can, then cut\r\noff all the Flesh, and season it with Pepper, Salt, and Allspice; then\r\nbreak the Bones and take out what Marrow you can to mix among your slices\r\nof Beef, which must be put in a deep Earthen Pot; cover then the whole with\r\nthe Skin, and lay the Bones over that, covering all with Paper, and tying\r\nit down close; after which, bake it with great Bread, and let it stand in\r\nthe Oven all Night. When this is done, take off the Bones and the Skin, and\r\nclear it from the Liquor as well as you can, then put the Meat into a\r\nWooden Bowl, and beat it as small as possible with a Wooden Pestle, often\r\nputting in some Butter, and some of the Fat of the Marrow, which will swim\r\nupon the Gravey, but suffer none of the Gravey to go in with it: when this\r\nis beat enough, while it is warm, butter the Bottom and Sides of the Pan\r\nwhich you design to keep it in, and press down your Meat in it as hard as\r\npossible; when that is done, cover it with melted Butter. If you would have\r\nyour Meat look red, rub it with a little Salt-peter before you season it.\r\nBy the same Method you may pot Venison, Mutton, or what Flesh else you\r\nplease, observing that 'tis only the fleshy or muscular Parts that are used\r\nin that way; and that they must be season'd and baked till they are tender,\r\nand then beat into a sort of Paste, with a little Butter added now and then\r\nwhile the Meat is beating. Keep these Meats in a cool dry Place, and you\r\nmay preserve them good several Weeks. If you desire to pot a Hare, take the\r\nfollowing Receipt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Pot a Hare, from the same.\r\n\r\nTake a Hare and bone it, then mince the Flesh very small, with a Pound of\r\nthe Fat of Bacon; after which, beat these in a Mortar, and then season your\r\nMeat with Pepper, Salt, Cloves and Mace, adding to it an Ounce of Salt\r\npeter: mix all these well, and let the Meat lie twenty-four Hours, then put\r\nit in an earthen glazed Pot, and bake it three Hours; after which, take it\r\nout, and dry it from the Gravey, then return it to the Pot again, and then\r\ncover it with clarified Butter. This Receipt might have been put in some of\r\nthe former Months, as the Hare is then in season; but as it depends upon\r\nthe foregoing Receipt, I thought convenient to insert it in this Place:\r\nhowever, a Jack-Hare may now be dress'd in this fashion, but the Doe-Hares\r\nare now either with Young or have Young ones, so that they are out of\r\nSeason. These Potted Meats are useful in Housekeeping, being always ready\r\nfor the Table: So likewise the following Receipt for Collar'd Beef is of\r\nthe same service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Collar Beef.\r\n\r\nGet the Rand or Flank of Beef cut about a foot in length; bone it, and then\r\nmix two Ounces of Salt peter, with a good handful of common Salt: after\r\nwhich, carbonade the outward Skin of the Beef, and rub the whole well with\r\nthe Salts, letting it lie for twenty-four hours in Salt before you collar\r\nit; but observing to turn it twice a day, at least, whilst it is in Salt.\r\nWhen it has lain thus to season, get some Sweet-Marjoram, a little\r\nWinter-Savoury, some Red Sage-leaves, and a little Thyme, and shred them\r\nsmall; among which put an Ounce of Pepper ground small, half an Ounce of\r\nCloves and Mace beat, and a Handful of Salt; mix these together, and stew\r\nthe mixture thick over the inside of your Meat, that when it is roll'd up,\r\nit may be equally bound in with the Turnings of the Beef: then provide some\r\nthin Slices of the same Beef to lay before the first Turn, that the Collar\r\nmay not be hollow in the middle. This must be roll'd as hard as possible,\r\nso that every Part is equally press'd to each other; then get some Tape\r\nabout an Inch wide, and bind it hard about your Collar of Beef, in a\r\nScrew-like manner, till you have closed your Collar from top to bottom as\r\ntight as can be; observing to bind the top and bottom in an extraordinary\r\nmanner with strong Packthread. Put this in a glazed earthen Pan, with as\r\nmuch Claret as will cover it, putting over the whole some coarse Paste, and\r\nsend it to the Oven to stand five or six Hours. When it is baked enough,\r\ntake out your Collar, and set it upright till it be cold, and then take off\r\nthe Fillets, or the Tape that braced it together, and keep it for use. This\r\nis cut in thin Slices, and eaten with Vinegar, as are most of the Collar'd\r\nmeats and Potted meats. This Example is enough for any one either to Collar\r\nother Meats by, only observing that such Flesh as is tender, as Pig and a\r\nBreast of Veal, must not be salted before they are collar'd, and the Spice\r\nor Herbs to be roll'd up with them, may be at discretion; but for the\r\nboiling or baking, the Time must be in proportion to their Size, or natural\r\nTenderness. It must nevertheless be observed, that they must be baked or\r\nboiled till all the Gravey is out of them; for the Gravey being in them,\r\nwill contribute to their spoiling by growing musty, or otherways foetid.\r\n\r\nWe have now Flounders in good Perfection, and besides the common Way of\r\nDressing them, either by boiling them, as mention'd in the former Months,\r\nthey are also sometimes fried, and sometimes broil'd; but the following is\r\nafter such a manner, as is extremely agreeable, and will preserve them good\r\na long time. These, or other Fish fry'd, are kept after the same manner:\r\nthe Receipt I had from a worthy Gentleman, where I eat some in great\r\nPerfection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPickled Fish. From _Aaron Harrington,_ Esq.\r\n\r\nLet the Fish be fry'd after the common manner, and when they are cold lay\r\nthem in a Dish, and pour on the following Pickle: Water and Vinegar equal\r\nquantities, _Jamaica_ Pepper, Pepper and Salt, a little Mace, a few\r\nBay-leaves, and some White-wine: when these have boiled together, pour the\r\nPickle on the Fish while it is not too hot; these eat extremely well.\r\n\r\nTrouts are now in good perfection in the South parts of our Country; that\r\nis, where the Weather has been favourable in the former Month; and then\r\nbesides the common way of boiling them we may have them potted, which will\r\nmake them as valuable as potted Charrs, which are a sort of Trout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo pott Trouts. From Mrs. _R. S._ of _Preston_ in _Lancashire._\r\n\r\nScale and clean your Trouts very well, wash them in Vinegar, and slit them\r\ndown the Back, after which put Pepper and Salt into the Incision, and on\r\ntheir Outsides, and let them lie upon a Dish three Hours; then lay them in\r\nan earthen glaz'd Pan, with pieces of Butter upon them, and put them in an\r\nOven two Hours, if they are Trouts fourteen Inches long, or less in\r\nproportion, taking care to tie some Paper close over the Pan. When this is\r\ndone, take away from them all the Liquor, and put them in a Pot, and as\r\nsoon as they are quite cold, pour some clarified Butter upon them to cover\r\nthem: These will eat as well as potted Charrs. Some will take out the Bone\r\nupon slitting the Back, and these have been often taken for Charrs; tho' I\r\ndon't know above two Places where the Charrs are, one is a Pool where a\r\nRiver or Brook runs thro' in _Lancashire,_ and the other is in a Pool at\r\n_Naant,_ within four Miles of _Caernarvon._ But the Charr is of the Trout\r\nkind, and it must be a good judge in Fish to distinguish one from another;\r\nhowever, there is some small difference, which the Criticks in fishing take\r\nnotice of.\r\n\r\nFish may also be kept in Pickle several Weeks, as the Jack and Trout\r\nespecially are agreeable Varieties.\r\n\r\nThis time is a proper Season for making a pleasant and strong Wine of\r\n_Malaga_ Raisins, which will keep good many Years, and among the best\r\nJudges of Wine is much admired; it is not unlike a strong Mountain Wine: at\r\nthis time also the Raisins are very cheap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Raisin Wine.\r\n\r\nTake half a hundred weight of _Malaga_ Raisins, pick them clean from the\r\nStalks, and chop the Raisins small, then put them into a large Tub, and\r\nboil ten Gallons of River Water, or such Water as is soft, and pour it hot\r\nupon them; let this be stirr'd twice or thrice every Day for twelve Days\r\nsuccessively, and then pour the Liquor into a Cask and make a Toast of\r\nBread, and while it is hot, spread it on both sides with Yeast or Barm, and\r\nput it into the Vessel to the Wine, and it will make it ferment gently,\r\nwhich you may know by its making a hissing Noise; during the time of\r\nworking, the Bung of the Vessel must be left open, and as soon as that is\r\nover, stop it up close. This will be fine and fit for Drinking in about\r\nfour Months time; but if you make twice the quantity, it should stand five\r\nor six Months before you broach it: Observe that you set it in a good\r\nCellar, such as I have mentioned in the Month of _March_, under the Article\r\nof Brewing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Fronteniac Wine.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing Receipt must be followed in every particular, only when you\r\nput it into the Vessel, add to it some of the Syrup of the white Fronteniac\r\nGrape, which we may make in _England_, tho' the Season is not favourable\r\nenough to ripen that sort of Grape; for in a bad Year, when the white\r\nFronteniac, or the Muscadella Grapes are hard and unripe, and without\r\nFlavour, yet if you bake them they will take the rich Flavour, which a good\r\nshare of Sun would have given them. You may either bake the Fronteniac\r\nGrapes with Sugar, or boil them to make a Syrup of their Juice, about a\r\nQuart of which Syrup will be enough to put to five Quarts of the Raisin\r\nWine. When these have work'd together, and stood a time, as directed in the\r\nforegoing Receipt, you will have a Fronteniac Wine of as rich a Flavour as\r\nthe _French_ sort, besides the Pleasure of knowing that all the Ingredients\r\nare wholesome.\r\n\r\nThis Month is the principal time for Asparagus, which every one knows how\r\nto prepare in the common way; but there are some particulars relating to\r\nthe fitting them for the Table, which I had from a curious Gentleman at\r\n_Antwerp,_ which I shall here set down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo preserve Asparagus.\r\n\r\nCut away all the hard part of your Asparagus, and just boil them up with\r\nButter and Salt, then fling them into cold Water, and presently take them\r\nout again and let them drain; when they are cold, put them in a Gallipot,\r\nlarge enough for them to lie without bending, putting to them some whole\r\nCloves; some Salt, and as much Vinegar and Water, in equal quantities, as\r\nwill cover them half an Inch; then take a single Linnen Cloth, and let it\r\ninto the Pot upon the Water, and pour melted Butter over it, and keep them\r\nin a temperate Place: When you use them, lay them to steep in warm Water,\r\nand dress them as you would do fresh Asparagus. It is to be noted, that in\r\n_Holland,_ and most places abroad, the Asparagus is always white, which is\r\ndone according to a method that I have inserted in my other Works; the\r\nmethod of bringing them to Table the foreign way, is to serve them with\r\nmelted Butter, Salt, Vinegar, and Nutmeg grated.\r\n\r\nThe Tops or Heads of Asparagus being broken in small pieces and boil'd, are\r\nused in Soups like green Pease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAsparagus in Cream. From the same.\r\n\r\nBreak the Tops of your Asparagus in small Pieces, then blanch them a little\r\nin boiling Water, or parboil them, after which put them in a Stew-Pan or\r\nFrying-Pan with Butter or Hog's-Lard, and let them remain a little while\r\nover a brisk Fire, taking care that they are not too greasy, but well\r\ndrain'd; then put them in a clean Stew-Pan with some Milk and Cream, a\r\ngentle Seasoning of Salt and Spice, with a small Bunch of sweet Herbs; and\r\njust when they are enough, add to them the Yolks of two or three Eggs\r\nbeaten, with a little Cream to bind your Sauce.\r\n\r\nThe Greens, which are now fit for boiling, are Sprouts of Cabbages, and\r\nyoung Cabbage-Plants, which every one knows how to prepare. There is also\r\nSpinage, which is best stew'd without any Water, its own Juice being\r\nsufficient; and we have still plenty of Lupines, that is, the flowring\r\nStalks of Turnips, which eat very agreeably; they should be gather'd about\r\nthe length of Asparagus, when the Tops are knotted for flowering, and the\r\nstrings in the outside of the Stalks stripp'd from them; then tie them in\r\nBunches, as you do Asparagus, and put them in boiling Water with some Salt,\r\nand let them boil three or four Minutes, then lay them to drain, without\r\npressing, and serve them to Table as you would do Asparagus. The same way\r\nis used in the management of Brocoli.\r\n\r\nThe middle of this Month the Cowslip is in Flower, or as some call it the\r\nPeigle; and now is the Season to make a most pleasant Wine of the Flowers.\r\nThis Receipt is the best I have met with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Peigle, or Cowslip Wine, From Mrs. _E. B._\r\n\r\nTo three Gallons of Wine, put six Pounds of fine Sugar, boil these together\r\nhalf an hour, and as the Scum rises, take it off; then set the Liquor to\r\ncool, and when it is quite cold, take a Spoonful of the best Ale-Yeast, and\r\nbeat it well with three Ounces of Syrup of Citron, or Syrup of Lemon; mix\r\nthese very well together with the Liquor; and then put into it a Pound and\r\nthree quarters of the yellow part of the Cowflip, or Peigle Flowers, which\r\nmust be cut from the Stalks a little beforehand, but no other part must be\r\nused: let these infuse and work three days in an Earthen Vessel, cover'd\r\nwith a Cloth; then strain them, and put your Liquor into a clean dry Cask,\r\nand let it stand to settle three Weeks or a Month before you bottle it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMAY.\r\n\r\nAs this is the busy Month in the Dairy, I shall here insert the Remarks I\r\nhave by me concerning the making of Cheeses; and in this Work it is first\r\nnecessary to know how to manage the Rennet. The Rennet is made of the\r\nCalves Bag, which is taken as soon as the Calf is kill'd, and scour'd\r\ninside and outside with Salt, after having first discharg'd it of the Curd,\r\nwhich is always found in it; this Curd must likewise be well wash'd in a\r\nCullender with Water, and the Hairs pick'd out of it till it becomes very\r\nwhite, then return the Curd again into the Bag, and add to it two good\r\nHandfuls of Salt, and shut the Mouth of the Bag close with a Skewer, then\r\nlay the Bag in an Earthen-Pan, and cover it close, and keep it in a dry\r\nplace; this will remain fit for use twelve Months. When you would use it,\r\nboil a Quart of Water, after you have salted it, so as to bear an Egg, and\r\nletting it stand to be quite cold, pour it into the Bag, and prick the Bag\r\nfull of very small Holes, and lay it in a clean Pan for use. While this\r\nRennet is fresh, a Spoonful of the Liquor will turn or set about sixteen or\r\ntwenty Gallons of Milk; but as it is longer kept, it grows weaker, and must\r\nbe used in greater quantity: this Rennet will last good about a Month. This\r\nis the _Essex_ and _Hertfordshire_ way.\r\n\r\nAnother way of preparing of Rennet Bags, is to take the Calves Bag, and\r\nwash and scour it with Salt, and the Curd likewise, as directed above; and\r\nthen salting it very well, hang it up in the Corner of a Kitchen Chimney,\r\nand dry it; and as soon as you want to use it, boil Water and Salt, as\r\nbefore, and fill the Bag with it, making small Holes in the Bag, as before\r\ndirected, and keeping it in a clean Pan.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted, that the Bag of the Calf, which is the part that\r\nreceives the Milk, is so disposed, as to change the Milk into Curd, as soon\r\nas it is received into it; and the Curd, which is found in it, partaking of\r\nthat quality of the Bag, which disposes it to harden the Milk; these are\r\ntherefore to be preserv'd for the same use, when we employ common Milk to\r\nbe made into Curd: but as the Calves Bag is warm, when it naturally\r\nreceives the Milk from the Cow, and it then curdles in it; so, when we want\r\nto set or turn Milk, for Cheese or other use, we must have the Milk warm as\r\none may guess the Body of the Calf was, and the Milk was likewise, when the\r\nCalf receiv'd it from the Cow. There is great danger if the Milk be too hot\r\nwhen the Rennet is put to it, for then it sets or turns to Curd very quick,\r\nand the Cheese will be hard; but it is good to let the Milk be of such a\r\nwarmth as not to come too soon, as it is called in the Dairies, but to have\r\nit of such a warmth, as to let the Curd set easily, and come moderately,\r\nfor the quicker the Curd comes, the harder it is, and the harder the Curd\r\nis, the harder is the Cheese. Again, we must have some regard to the\r\nPasture where our Cows feed; those that feed in rank Grass have more watery\r\nparts in their Milk than those Cows which feed on short Grass: and\r\nsometimes, as I have observed before, in my other Works, the Cows feed upon\r\nCrow Garlick, or the Alliaria, or Sauce alone, or Jack in the Hedge, or\r\nGoose-grass, or Clivers, or Rennet Wort, and their Milk will either be ill\r\ntasted, or else turn or curd of itself, altho' the Cow has had a due time\r\nafter Calving; and if the Goose-grass or Clivers happen to be the occasion\r\nof the turning of the Milk, then a less quantity of Rennet should be used:\r\nfor the only use of Rennet is to fix the Milk, and turn it to Curd, and if\r\nalready there is near an equivalent for Rennet in the Milk, by the Cow's\r\neating such Herbs, then a little of it will do. But as I have observ'd\r\nabove, where Cattle feed upon long rank Grass, the Milk is watery, and does\r\nnot contain two thirds of the Cream, or Richness that there is in the same\r\nquantity of Milk from Cows fed upon short fine Grass: So that if one was to\r\nmake Cheese, one would chuse the Milk of Cows that fed upon the purest fine\r\nGrass. Here the Milk would be rich, and if the Rennet is good and well\r\nproportion'd, the Cheese will be so too. It is to be observ'd likewise,\r\nthat when Cows feed upon such Weeds as I have mention'd, I mean the\r\nClivers, which turn their Milk, the Curd is always hard and scatter'd, and\r\nnever comes into a Body, as the pure Milk will do that is set with Rennet,\r\nand consequently the Cheese will be hard. There is one thing likewise to be\r\ntaken notice of, with regard to the Rennet, that as the Bag, of which it is\r\nmade, happens to be good, so is the Rennet good in proportion. I mean the\r\nBag is good when the Milk of the Cow, that suckled the Calf, is good; for\r\nthe goodness of the Feed of the Cow does not only dispose the Body of the\r\nCalf to produce a gentleness or softness in the Acid, which promotes the\r\ncurdling of the Milk, when it is received into the Body of the Calf, but\r\nmakes the Rennet more tender to the setting of the Cheese-Curd, and so the\r\nCheese will consequently be the better for it: And I judge that one reason\r\nwhy the _Suffolk_ Cheese is so much noted for its hardness, is on account\r\nof the badness of the Rennet, tho' it is certain, that the worst Cheeses of\r\nthat Country are made of Skim-Milk; however, the nature of the Milk is\r\nsuch, according to my Observation, that it makes very rich Butter, but the\r\nCream rises on it so quickly, and so substantially, that it leaves no\r\nfatness or richness in the other part, which we call the Skim-Milk, but\r\nthat remains little better than Water: so that 'tis no wonder in this case,\r\nand thro' the rank Feed of the Cows, that the Cheeses of those parts are\r\nnot good. I think however the Cheese of _Suffolk_ might be help'd in a good\r\nmeasure, if the Farmers there were to have their Rennet Bags from places\r\nwhere the Grass was short and fine; for I guess then, from the above\r\nreasoning, that the Curd would be of a more tender nature, or not of so\r\nbinding a quality as it now is, and the Cheese consequently would be the\r\nbetter. But besides the goodness of the Milk and the Rennet, if a Cheese is\r\nover press'd, it will be hard and unpleasant; but it is to be remark'd,\r\nthat all Cheeses that are hard press'd will keep longer than those that are\r\ngently press'd, and bear transporting thro' the hottest Climates, which the\r\nmore tender-made Cheeses will not without corrupting, unless they are put\r\ninto Oil. There is one thing which I may observe particularly, relating to\r\nthe Rennet Bag; which is, that the Calf should suck it full about an hour\r\nbefore it is kill'd, that there may be more and fresher Curd in it; tho' in\r\nthe killing of Calves it is a Rule to let the Calf fast some time before\r\nkilling, which we are told contributes to the Whiteness of the Flesh.\r\nAgain, it would be an advantage in the making of Cheese to have your Cattle\r\nall of one sort, and to feed all upon the same sort of Pasture; for when it\r\nhappens to be otherwise, the Cheeses are apt to decay, from the different\r\nTempers of the Milk; but let our Milk be what it will, be careful of the\r\nformer Method prescribed, _i.e._ to break the Curd by gentle degrees, and\r\nas equally as possible every where: the little pains extraordinary will be\r\npaid in the goodness of the Cheese, for then it will not be full of Eyes or\r\nHollows, and will sell the better.\r\n\r\nBut besides the way of preparing the Rennet, as I have here set down, it is\r\npractised to make an artificial Rennet, which will do very well for making\r\nof Cheese; and that is, to boil the Cliver, or as some call it Goose-grass,\r\nor others Rennet-Wort, in Water, and you may add some Tops of Sweet Bryar;\r\nabout a Spoonful of which Decoction, or boiled Liquor, will turn a\r\nPail-full of Milk, of about five Gallons, without any other help; but in\r\nthe Preparation of this, as well as the other, for the Improvement of the\r\nCheeses, in giving them rich Flavours, it is adviseable to insert, while we\r\nare boiling the Waters for them, either some of such Sweet Herbs as we\r\nlike, or such Spices as we most covet the taste of. As for the famous\r\n_Stilton_ Cheese, which I have already published the Receipt of, we are to\r\nmake the Rennet strong of Mace, by boiling the Mace in the Salt and Water,\r\nfor without that is done, the Cheese will not have the true Relish that the\r\nfirst famous _Stilton_ Cheeses had; and without the People of _Stilton_\r\nkeep up the antient way of making it, agreeable to the old Receipt, they\r\nmust of necessity lose the Reputation they have gain'd by their Cheeses. I\r\nshall not pretend to affirm why the Cheeses now in that Town are not\r\ngenerally so good as they were formerly; but perhaps it is because some of\r\nthe Cheese-Sellers there depend upon the reputation of the first Cheeses,\r\nand now buy Cheeses from other parts, where nothing of the true Receipt is\r\nknown but the Figure. However, it would be injustice in me if I did not\r\ntake notice, that the Master of the _Blue-Bell Inn_ in _Stilton_ provided\r\nme with one that was excellent in its way, and yearly furnishes as many\r\nCustomers with them as give him timely Notice: But as these Cheeses require\r\ntime in the Dairy, before they are fit for eating, and the Season of making\r\nthem is in the Bloom of the Year, so it is necessary to speak for them\r\nbetimes, to have them to one's mind. I shall not give the Receipt of it at\r\nthis time, as it has already fallen into a good number of hands with my\r\nformer Pieces, and has been thought good enough to have been copied from\r\nme, with many other Articles, and published by Mr. _Lawrence._ I shall\r\nproceed therefore to give the Receipts for making of some other kinds of\r\nCheeses, which yet have not appear'd in the World, which I have collected\r\nfrom some of the best Dairies in _England._ The following is the famous\r\n_Buckingham_ Cheese, which I had from Mr. _Foord,_ a very curious Gentleman\r\nof that place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Buckingham_ Cheese. From Mr. _Foord_ of that Place.\r\n\r\nPrepare a Cheese Vat or Cheese Mote of a square Figure, six Inches over,\r\nand nine Inches deep, full of small Holes for the convenience of letting\r\nout the Whey when the Curd is put into it: Then take the Night's Cream, and\r\nmix it with the Morning's Milk, and put the Rennet to it to cool. When the\r\nCurd is come, take it gently from the Whey, and fill the Cheese Vat with\r\nit, and lay a Board up on the Curd, and as that sinks, fill up the Cheese\r\nVat with fresh Curds; this should be done once every Hour till Night. The\r\nnext Day turn your Cheese upside down, and continue turning it every Night\r\nand Morning till it shrinks from the Vat or Cheese Mote, and is stiff\r\nenough to take out without breaking, and then lay it upon the Shelf to be\r\nturn'd, and shift it Night and Morning till 'tis dry for use. This Mr.\r\n_Foord_ tells me is the best sort of Cheese he has met with in _England._\r\n\r\nThe following I have experienced to be an extraordinary Cheese; in some\r\nplaces 'tis call'd the Golden Cheese, and in others the Marygold Cheese,\r\nwhich it is properly. The Juice of the Marygolds adds a very great richness\r\nto the Milk, and contributes almost as much to it as Cream would do. The\r\nfollowing is the Receipt to make it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Marygold Cheese.\r\n\r\nGather your Marygold Flowers in a dry Day, and pick the golden-colour'd\r\nLeaves from them, (these we call the Petals of the Flowers:) As soon as you\r\nhave pick'd a sufficient quantity of these Leaves for your use, bruise them\r\nin a Mortar, or grind them, if you have Conveniency, and strain out the\r\nJuice; this Juice, when you put the Rennet to the Milk, must be put into\r\nthe Milk, and stirr'd into it. The Milk must then be set, and as soon as\r\nthe Curd is come, break it gently, and as equally as possible, and put it\r\ninto the Cheese Vat, and press it with a gentle Weight, letting the bottom\r\npart of the Vat have such a number of Holes in it, as will let out the Whey\r\neasily, or else a Spout to carry off the Whey; but the Holes are much\r\nbetter than the Spout. This Cheese, which is made in a Cloth, must be used\r\nlike other Cheeses made after that manner.\r\n\r\nAs for the making of Sage-Cheese, the following is the best way that I have\r\nmet with, and therefore I think the Receipt may be useful to the Publick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make a plain Sage-Cheese.\r\n\r\nGather the young Tops of red Sage, and bruise them in a Mortar till you can\r\npress the Juice from them; then take Leaves of Spinach or Spinage, and\r\nbruise them likewise, and press out the Juice to mix with the Sage Juice;\r\nfor the Sage Juice of it self is not of a pleasant green Colour, and the\r\nSpinach Juice is added to it to render it more bright to the Sight; it also\r\nserves to take off the bitterness of the Sage. When this Juice is prepared,\r\nput your Rennet to the Milk, and, at the same time, mix as much of your\r\nSage and Spinach Juice with it, as will give the Milk the green Colour you\r\ndesire. If you would have it strong of the Sage, you must have the greater\r\nshare of Sage Juice; or weaker of the Sage, the greater share of Spinach\r\nJuice. When the Curd is come, break the Curd gently, and when it is all\r\nequally broken, put it into the Vat or Cheese Mote, and press it gently:\r\nremember that the equal and due breaking of the Curd will keep your Cheese\r\nfrom having Hollows or Eyes in it, and the gentle pressing of Cheese will\r\nmake it eat tender and mellow. This, as well as the Marygold Cheese, must\r\nbe salted, when it has been press'd about eight Hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Sage-Cheese in Figures.\r\n\r\nThose that are willing to have figur'd Cheeses, such Cheeses as are partly\r\ngreen and partly otherwise, must take the following method. Provide two\r\nCheese Vats of the same bigness, and set your Milk in two different\r\nVessels; one part with plain Rennet only, and the other with Rennet and\r\nSage Juice, as directed in the above Receipt; make these as you would do\r\ntwo distinct Cheeses, and put them into the Presses at the same time. When\r\neach of these Cheeses has been prest half an hour, take them out and cut\r\nsome square Pieces, or long Slips, quite out of the plain Cheese, and lay\r\nthem by upon a Plate; then cut as many Pieces out of the Sage Cheese, of\r\nthe same Size and Figure of those that were cut out of the plain Cheese,\r\nand presently put the pieces of the Sage Cheese into the holes that were\r\ncut in the plain Cheese, and the pieces cutout of the plain Cheese into the\r\nholes of the Sage Cheese, contriving to make them fit exactly: for this use\r\nsome have Tin Plate, made into Figures of several Shapes, with which they\r\ncut out the pieces of their Cheeses so exactly, that they fit without\r\ntrouble. When this is done, return them to the Presses, and treat them like\r\ncommon Cheeses, so will you have one Cheese Sage, with white or plain\r\nFigures in it, and the other a white Cheese, with green Figures in it. In\r\nthe making of these Cheeses you must particularly observe to break your\r\nCurd very equally, and press both your Cheeses as equally as possible\r\nbefore you cut out the Figures; for else when they come to be press'd for\r\nthe last time, your Figures will press unequally and lose their Shapes.\r\nWhen these Cheeses are made, they must be frequently turn'd and shifted on\r\nthe Shelf, and often rubb'd with a coarse Cloath. These Cheeses may be made\r\nabout two Inches thick, for if they are thicker, it will be more difficult\r\nto make the Figures regular; these will be fit to eat in about eight\r\nMonths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Cheese in imitation of _Cheshire_ Cheese.\r\n\r\nWhen your Milk is set, and the Curd is come, it must not be broken with a\r\nDish, as is usual in the making of other Cheeses, but drawn together by the\r\nHands to one side of the Vessel, gently and regularly broken; for if it is\r\nroughly press'd, a great deal of the richness of the Milk will go into the\r\nWhey. As you thus gather your Curd, put it into the Vat or Cheese Mote till\r\nit is full, then press it and turn it often, salting it at several times.\r\nIt is to be noted, that the Cheeses should be six or eight Inches thick,\r\nand will be fit to eat in a Year; they must be frequently turn'd and\r\nshifted upon the Shelf, and rubb'd often with a dry coarse Cloath, and at\r\nthe Year's end may have a hole bored in the middle, so as to contain a\r\nquarter Pint of Sack, which must be pour'd into it, and then the hole\r\nstopp'd close with some of the same Cheese, and the Cheese set in a Wine\r\nCellar for six Months to mellow; at the end of which time, the Sack will be\r\nall lost, and the hole will be in a manner clos'd up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Cheese in imitation of those made in _Gloucestershire._\r\n\r\nThese Cheeses are to be about two Inches thick, and the Vats or Cheese\r\nMotes must be provided accordingly; set your Milk as directed in the former\r\nReceipts, and breaking it as equally and tenderly as possible, put it in a\r\nCloth into the Vat, and set it in the press for an Hour; then take it out\r\nof the Press, and cut it in small Pieces, as big as Nutmegs, into a Pan of\r\nscalding Water, taking them again soon out of the Water, and sprinkle them\r\nwith Salt at your pleasure, and return them again to the Vat or Cheese\r\nMote, and keep them in the Press till the next Morning, and after that turn\r\nthem and wipe them often, till they come to be very dry; or else when you\r\nhave let one of these Cheeses press about two Hours, salt it on the upper\r\nside, and turn it at Night, and salt the side that lies uppermost, to lie\r\nin the Press till Morning; but the first way of cutting and salting it is\r\nmuch the best. These Cheeses will be fit to cut when they have been made\r\neight Months; it is to be observ'd, that if we salt them in the manner\r\nfirst mention'd, that is, by cutting the Cheese, such Cheeses will be\r\nsmooth-coated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Slip-Coat Cheese, which is the thin Summer Cheese, call'd in\r\n_London_ Cream Cheese. From the Farm call'd the _Vaises_ in _Essex._\r\n\r\nTake six Quarts of new Milk, and a Pint of Cream, put it together with a\r\nSpoonful of Rennet just warm, and let it stand till the Curd is come; then\r\nlay a Cloath in your Cheese Vat, and with a Skimming-Dish cut out the Curd,\r\nand lay it in the Vat till it is full, turning your Cheese-Cloath over it;\r\nand as the Curd settles, lay more on, till you have laid on all. When the\r\nWhey is drain'd out, turn the Cheese into a dry Cloath, and then lay a\r\nweight of a Pound upon it; at Night turn it into another dry Cloath, and\r\nthe next Morning salt it a little, then make a Bed of Nettles or Ash-Leaves\r\nto lay it on, and cover it with the same, shifting them twice a day, till\r\nthe Cheese is fit to eat, which will be in about ten days. This Cheese is\r\napproved to be the best of the kind in the whole Country, and may be made\r\nall the Summer.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observ'd, that if in any sort of Cheese, which is here\r\nmentioned, there is not a strength or briskness of taste agreeable to every\r\nPalate, it may be strengthned, by putting either Spice into the Rennet Bag,\r\nas Pepper, or Mace, or Cloves, which will make the Rennet very strong, and\r\nthe Cheese of consequence more sharp to the Palate; or else add the Juices\r\nof strong sweet Herbs to the Milk, when the Rennet is put in: the Juice of\r\nMarygolds especially helps the richness of the Milk, or Cheese. The Mace in\r\ngood quantity put into the Rennet will give the Cheese a most agreeable\r\nwarmth.\r\n\r\nAs for the Antipathy which some People bear to Cheese, I judge that it must\r\nproceed from the first impression made from the Nurse that suckles\r\nChildren, or from the first Cow's Milk that is given them: for as the\r\nStomach is the first part which the Nourishment is received into; so, as\r\nthat Nourishment is at first favourably receiv'd into the Stomach, so the\r\nTone of the Stomach will ever remain afterwards, unless it could be so\r\nclear'd from the first impression by such a Tryal as Human Nature can\r\nhardly bear. I guess too, that from this Prejudice in the Stomach proceeds\r\nthe Aversion which some People have to the Smell of Cheese; and if I may go\r\na little farther this way, I suppose that the Dislike to Cats, and the\r\nAntipathy some People bear to them, is from Frights which the Mothers have\r\nreceiv'd from them during their Pregnancy: concerning which last\r\nParticular, I have offer'd my Sentiments in the Article of the Longing of\r\nWomen, in my _Philosophical Account of the Works of Nature_. But as for the\r\nother things, which some People bear an Aversion to, as the Mutton of black\r\nSheep, or a Breast of Mutton, _&c._ they depend upon the loathing of the\r\nStomach, from the first Impression. What I have remark'd here, concerning\r\nthe preparing and softning of the quality of the Rennet Bag, is in part a\r\nreason for the first good or bad Impression that may be made upon Mankind\r\nwith regard to Cheese; and I think the following relation, which I had from\r\na noble Peer, from whom I have learnt many curious and useful things,\r\ntending to the good of my Country, will be acceptable to the World.\r\n\r\nSome Gentlemen that had been hunting, and were led by their Sport to a\r\nretir'd part of the Country, where they found only a Cottage to refresh\r\nthemselves in, were forc'd to take up with Bread and Cheese; there was\r\nnothing else to be had, and they had craving Stomachs: but one of the\r\nCompany was so unfortunate as to have an aversion to Cheese, and could\r\nnever bear either the taste or smell of it; however, at this time feeing\r\nhow heartily it was eaten by his Companions, and being very hungry, he\r\nresolved to venture upon it, and eat heartily of it; but about an hour\r\nafter was taken so very ill with Purging and Vomiting, that in a short time\r\nhis Life was despair'd of. He had the Advice of the best Physicians, but no\r\nMedicine took place, and he was given over, after he had lain in that\r\ncondition a Week; however, at length the Distemper went off, and by degrees\r\nhe get strength enough to go homeward, and in his way happening to stop at\r\nan Inn, where there stood a Waggon Load of _Cheshire_ Cheeses, he found\r\nthat he had a strong Appetite to eat some of that sort, and had one cut on\r\npurpose, and eat heartily of it, without suffering the least inconvenience,\r\nand has ever since been a great lover of Cheese. So that there is an\r\nExample of getting over this Aversion; but considering the difficulty he\r\nwent thro', it shews the danger of such an Attempt: Nothing less than the\r\nviolent Scouring he underwent could have chang'd the first Impression made\r\nin his Stomach. But thus far of Cheese.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, in the next place, to say something of Butter, and how far\r\nthat may be mended in many parts of _England_, as well for private as for\r\nmore general use.\r\n\r\nIn the first place it is to be remark'd, that some Grounds will never\r\nproduce good Butter, and others will not produce good Cheese, tho' there is\r\nthe best management in the Dairy. Again, there is one sort of Cattle, which\r\ntho' we feed them in the finest Grass, and best Pasture, will never yield a\r\nrich Milk; while on the other hand, there are some sorts of Cattle which\r\nwill yield a rich Milk for Butter in any Pasture: tho', as I have observ'd\r\nbefore, the Milk and Butter will be ill tasted if the Cows fed upon\r\nCrow-Garlick, Alliaria, or Saxifrage. What I have said of this, with regard\r\nto the making of Cheese, must here be consider'd; that is, if the Cows feed\r\nupon short fine Grass, there will be more Cream in the Milk than if they\r\nfeed upon long rank Grass. Indeed the long rank Grass will give more Milk\r\nthan the short, but less Butter, and worse into the bargain. Again, the\r\nMilk of one Cow shall give richer and better Butter than the Milk of\r\nothers, tho' they all feed on the same Pasture, even so that the Milk of\r\none Cow will cover or enrich the Butter made from nine or ten other Cows;\r\nher Milk will make Butter of a rich yellow Colour, full of Fatness, and the\r\nothers will only produce a pale, lean Butter, but all together will be\r\ngood: I know several Instances of this, and every one who is skilful in a\r\nDairy may observe it. I have already treated largely concerning this\r\nParticular, in my Works of Husbandry, and I shall therefore proceed to\r\nspeak of the Management of Milk in the Dairy for making Butter; for I am\r\nvery sensible, that many Farmers might have twice the Benefit from their\r\nDairies, if the Articles of Butter and Cheese were consider'd in a rational\r\nway, and the old Custom could be broke through; and moreover, if the best\r\nRules for managing of the Dairy were known, and put in practice, the whole\r\nCountry would be the better for it, every one might enjoy the benefit of\r\ngood things: whereas for want of knowledge among some Farmers, their Goods\r\nare of small value, and the People are also disatisfied.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of _England_, it is common to set Milk in Brass Pans, and\r\nthat gives an ill Taste to the Milk; and again, there is a custom of\r\nsetting the Cream in Brass-Kettles over the Fire, and as it warms to stroak\r\nthe Butter as it rises to the edge of the Kettle: this way is very bad for\r\nButter, for the warm Brass assuredly will spoil the Taste of the Cream, and\r\nit is often smoak'd. The surest way is to set the Milk in glaz'd Earthen\r\nPans or in Leaden Pans, but the Earthen Pans are preferable. It should be\r\nparticularly observ'd, that the Dairy be kept cool, for that in hot Weather\r\ncontributes greatly to the Advantage of the Butter: I have known some that\r\nhave had Streams of Water running thro' them, and at the same Places,\r\ninstead of Glass Windows, there have been no Lights at all to them but\r\nthro' Wyer, and Shutters to them, to open or close as the Sun chang'd its\r\nCourse. The thatching of the Dairy is much cooler also than Tyling; and\r\nwhatever will contribute to keep off the Sun, should be practis'd. There\r\nare yet in some Places in _England_ some Farmers that do not know the use\r\nof the Churn; however, it is certain, that there is no better way of making\r\nButter than by that means, or something equivalent to it; that is, by\r\nbeating the Cream, so that the Oily, or Fat Parts separate from the Watery\r\nParts, in the most constant and gentle way that is possible, for to use\r\nthis beating of the Cream too violently, will make the Butter like Grease;\r\nwhereas a gentle beating of the Cream will render it more firm or stiff:\r\nand besides, when the Cream is beat with too much hurry, the Butter will\r\nferment, and presently change to be of a bad Taste; but if it be gently\r\nbeat or churn'd, it will be firm, and will be fit for keeping. Again, it\r\nmust be observ'd, that as the beating or churning of Cream, to bring it to\r\nButter, is only to separate the oily from the watery Parts of the Cream, so\r\nwhen once you begin to churn, or beat the Cream, you must continue to churn\r\nor beat it in the most constant manner you can, till the Butter is made:\r\nfor if you had perhaps beat the Cream within three or four Minutes of its\r\nbecoming Butter, if you leave off the Work but a Minute, the oily and\r\nwatery Parts will return to one another, and will require as much Labour as\r\nbefore to separate them: it is like Oil and Vinegar that have been mix'd by\r\nLabour, and then let alone for a Minute or two, they will divide and\r\nseparate from one another, as much as if they had never been mix'd; but the\r\nbeating of it too violently, will make the Butter oily, as observ'd before.\r\nAs for the Figure of our common Churn, I shall not give a draught of it,\r\nbecause such as are unacquainted with it may understand it much better by\r\nseeing a Model of it, which may be had at any Toy-Shop in _London_; nay,\r\nthe very beating of Cream with a Spoon, in a small Bowl, will bring it to\r\nButter; but it must be beat regularly.\r\n\r\nIn the great Dairies in _Holland_, where one Farmer keeps four or five\r\nhundred Cows, the Cream is put into a large Well, lined with Lead, and a\r\nlarge Beam set with cross Bars is turn'd in the Cream by a Horse; but the\r\nviolence of the Motion makes the Butter rather like Oil than Butter; and\r\nthe consequence is, that it will not keep long, and as I have heard say,\r\nwill not melt well, like the Butter that is made by more gentle means.\r\nWhere a gentle way is used in making Butter, it will cut like Wax, and it\r\nshould especially be well wrought with the Hands, when it is fresh, taken\r\nfrom the Churn and salted for common use; for if the Milk be not well\r\nwork'd out of it, the Butter will not keep. However, if Butter begins to\r\ndecay in goodness, or change to an ill Taste, let it be work'd well, and\r\nwash'd with Water, and it will come to itself, and will bear salting and\r\npotting as well as fresh Butter; but always observe not to put up Butters\r\nof several sorts into the same Pot or Vessel, but chuse that of the same\r\nDairy, and of the same making, if possible. One of the most curious Women I\r\nhave met with in this way, is Mrs. _Cowen,_ a Shopkeeper at _Newport Pond_\r\nin _Essex,_ who pots great quantities every Year; there are undoubtedly\r\nmany others who are very good in this way, but as I do not know them,\r\ntherefore I may be excus'd if I mention her in particular.\r\n\r\nAgain, Butter that was good originally, and well potted, may be wash'd and\r\nbeaten in the Winter, so as to be made more sweet and palatable than fresh\r\nButter, made in many Places, at that time of the Year; and this is\r\nfrequently practiced about _London,_ where the workers of it get more than\r\ntwice the first Price of the Butter, by their Care and Labour.\r\n\r\nBefore I conclude this Article, it may be necessary to observe, that the\r\nbest managers of the Dairy frequently fill up their Churns with cold Water,\r\nbefore they put in the Cream to churn, in the heat of the Summer, for fear\r\nof over-heating the Butter in the making, and in the Winter heat their\r\nChurns with warm Water before they use them, but the over-heating of the\r\nChurns spoils the Butter; she best way is to set the bottom of the Churn in\r\nwarm Water, when you churn in cold Weather, to save Trouble.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to say something of preparing Cordial Waters; for this\r\nMonth gives us a vast variety of Herbs in full perfection, and in the most\r\nproper condition for the use of the Shops, whether for drying, infusing,\r\ndistilling, _&c._\r\n\r\nIn the first place, all Herbs design'd to be dried, must be gather'd in dry\r\nWeather, and laid in some Room, or cover'd Place, to dry in the Shade, to\r\nbe afterwards used for infusion or distillation, for which Business the\r\ndried Herbs are as useful as the green Herbs, if they be such as are\r\nAromatick, _viz._ Thyme, Sweet Marjoram, Savory, Hysop, Sage, Mint,\r\nRosemary, the Leaves of the Bay-Tree, the Tops of Juniper, Gill, or Ground\r\nIvy, and such like: The Infusions, or Spirits, drawn from dried Herbs are\r\nmore free from the Earthy and Watery Parts, than the Infusions, or Spirits\r\ndrawn from green Herbs. I observe, that in making such Infusions as Teas of\r\ndried Herbs, the best way is to pour boiling Water upon them, and in half a\r\nMinute, at most, pour out the Water again from the Herbs, if we have them\r\nin small quantities, as we do Sage Tea, or other Tea; such Tea will then be\r\nof a fine green Colour, and full of Spirit: but if the Herbs stand longer\r\nwith Water upon them, the Water will change of a brownish Colour, will lose\r\nthe fine Flavour of the Herb, and become ill-tasted; so that in the making\r\nof Sage Tea, for example, pour on your boiling Water, and when it has been\r\nhalf a Minute upon the Sage-Leaves, pour it off and fling away the Leaves;\r\nfor if you pour more Water upon them, you must expect your Tea of a dark\r\nColour and ill tasted: therefore have fresh Sage to every fresh quantity of\r\nWater. And the same method should be used in the making of all kinds of\r\nTeas, to make them palatable and more wholesome. But when I speak of Teas\r\nhaving good qualities in them, I must not be understood to mean any of the\r\nForeign Teas, such as Green, and Bohea Teas, _&c._ for I have had\r\nexperience enough in them to know that they are injurious to the Body, of\r\nwhich I shall say more in a Treatise by it self. What I mention here, is\r\nonly with regard to the infusing of Herbs in the Tea manner; but there are\r\nInfusions of Herbs in Spirits: here the Spirit that the Herbs are put into,\r\nmust be cold, or used without any Fire at all, and the Herbs in this case\r\nmay be used either green or dry; here they may stand several days before\r\nthe Spirit that they are infus'd in be drawn off, as the following Cordial,\r\ncall'd Surfeit Water, may serve to instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make red Surfeit-Water. From Mrs. _B._\r\n\r\nTo three Gallons of Brandy, put the Flower Leaves of a Bushel of red\r\nPoppies, one Pound of Raisins of the Sun stoned, a large Stick of Liquorice\r\nsliced, a quarter Pound of Caraway-Seeds bruised, a large Handful of\r\nAngelica, Sweet Marjoram, red Sage, Dragon's Mint, and Baulm, of each a\r\nhandful; let all these be cover'd close in a Glass, or glaz'd Earthen\r\nVessel, and stand to infuse or steep in the Brandy for nine Days, keeping\r\nit, during that time, in a Cellar; then strain it off upon a Pound and half\r\nof Loaf-Sugar, and put it into Bottles. This is a good Cordial, if used\r\nonly when occasion requires.\r\n\r\nIn this Month, Orange-Flowers are in the greatest plenty; about half a\r\nPound of them put into a Gallon of Brandy, with a quarter Pound of\r\nOrange-Peel, and half a Pound of double refin'd Loaf-Sugar, makes a very\r\nagreeable Cordial: We may let these Ingredients infuse in the Brandy nine\r\nor ten days before we pour the Brandy from them. Some chuse rather to put\r\nthe Sugar to the Brandy after it is pour'd from the Orange-Flowers.\r\n\r\nAs for the distilling part, we have already several Books which treat\r\nlargely of that Business, both with respect to the management of what is\r\ncall'd the cold Still, and the Alembick, to which I shall refer: but in\r\nthis place I shall only take notice, that whereas several kinds of\r\ndistill'd Waters are drawn from many Herbs, which do not appear all the\r\nYear about; so if one has not an opportunity of collecting all our Herbs\r\ntogether, just when we want them, we may yet distil those we can get at one\r\ntime, and make another Distillation of those we collect at another time,\r\nand so mix both Spirits or Waters together: For Example, in those Cordial\r\nWaters where the Ros Solis, or Rosa Solis is used, which is an Herb not\r\nalways to be found, and will not keep above a day or two after 'tis\r\ngather'd, this I say may be distill'd by itself, and kept to use with other\r\nWaters at pleasure; putting of this such a proportion as would have been\r\nproduced from the quantity directed, of the Plant, in the Receipt, if it\r\nhad been distill'd with the other Herbs: and so of any other Herb that is\r\nhard to come by.\r\n\r\nThis Herb, however, I may inform my Reader, grows in Bogs, and when we find\r\nit we may preserve it artificially, by either planting it immediately in\r\nother boggy places, or else in artificial Bogs, made of Earth and Water in\r\nTubs, or Earthen Pots, made without holes at the bottom.\r\n\r\nThis Season affords us great variety of Necessaries for Food, in the Farm\r\nand Garden; the Pond Fish, as Pike or Jack, Carp, Tench, and Perch, as well\r\nas Eels are in Season, and may be prepared for the Table, as directed in\r\n_March;_ there are likewise green Geese, young Ducks, Chickens, Pigeons,\r\nand Rabbits in the artificial Warren; and in the Garden, Spinage and\r\nCabbage-Lettuce to boil, some forward Pease and Beans, Asparagus,\r\nArtichokes, the first Cabbages, and Caulyflowers, Cucumbers for stewing and\r\nin raw Sallads: however, in this Season all raw Sallads should yet partake\r\nof some warm Herbs, as I have directed in my _New Improvement of Planting\r\nand Gardening._ The Method which I most approve of for dressing a Sallad,\r\nis, after we have duly proportion'd the Herbs, to take two thirds Oil\r\nOlive, one third true Vinegar, some hard Eggs cut small, both the Whites\r\nand Yolks, a little Salt and some Mustard, all which must be well mix'd and\r\npour'd over the Sallad, having first cut the large Herbs, such as Sallery,\r\nEndive, or Cabbage-Lettuce, but none of the small ones: then mix all these\r\nwell together, that it may be ready just when you want to use it, for the\r\nOil will make it presently soften, and lose its briskness. Onions should\r\nalways be kept in reserve, because it is not every one that like their\r\nrelish, nor is Oil agreeable to every one; but where Oil is not liked, the\r\nYolks of hard Eggs, bruis'd and mix'd with the Vinegar, may be used as\r\nabove. The difficulty of getting good Oil in _England,_ is, I suppose, the\r\nreason why every one does not admire it; for I was once of opinion I could\r\nnever like it: but when I was once persuaded to taste such as was of the\r\nbest sort, I could never after like a Sallad without it. The best Oil that\r\nI have met with in _England,_ is at _Mr. Crosse's,_ a _Genouese_ Merchant,\r\nat the _Genouese Arms_ in _Katherine-Street,_ in the _Strand, London._\r\n\r\nAs for the ordering of the above Animals and Vegetables for the Table, we\r\nmay find Directions in this Work.\r\n\r\nIn this Month gather Elder-Flowers when they are dry, and pick them from\r\nthe Stalks; let them dry in the Shade, and then put an Ounce to each Quart\r\nof White-Wine Vinegar, to stand in the Vinegar for two Months, then pour\r\nthe Vinegar from them for use.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of this Month is a proper time to make Sage-Wine, which is a\r\nvery pleasant one, and I think worthy a place among the best Receipts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Sage-Wine. From Mrs. _E. B._\r\n\r\nTo three Gallons of Water put six Pounds of Sugar, boil these together, and\r\nas the Scum rises take it off, and when it is well boiled put it in a Tub\r\nboiling hot, in which there is already a Gallon of red Sage Leaves clean\r\npick'd and wash'd; when the Liquor is near cold, put in the Juice of four\r\nlarge Lemons, beaten well with a little Ale Yeast, mix these all well\r\ntogether, and cover it very close from the Air, and let it stand forty\r\neight Hours; then strain all thro' a fine Hair-Sieve, and put it into a\r\nVessel that will but just hold it, and when it has done working, slop it\r\ndown close, and let it stand three Weeks or a Month before you bottle it,\r\nputting a Lump of Loaf-Sugar into every Bottle. This Wine is best when it\r\nis three Months old. After this manner you may make Wine of any other Herb\r\nor Flower.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJUNE.\r\n\r\nThis Month is a proper Season for making several sorts of Wine, whether it\r\nbe that of Goosberries, Currants, Cherries, Apricots, or Rasberries, all\r\nwhich are very agreeable and worth the trouble; the Expence, where these\r\nFruits are growing, being very inconsiderable. The following Receipts are\r\napproved to be very excellent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreliminaries to the making of Goosberry-Wine.\r\n\r\nGoosberry-Wine is one of the richest and strongest Wines made in _England_,\r\nit will keep many Years, and improve by keeping, if it be well made; and is\r\nnot, in my opinion, inferior to Mountain _Malaga_.\r\n\r\nTo make this Wine, we must have regard to the sort of Goosberry we design\r\nto use, for there is a great deal of difference in the time of one sort's\r\nripening and another: the earliest ripe are the Champaign, the Green, the\r\nBlack, and Red hairy Goosberries, every one of which has a Flavour distinct\r\nfrom the other sorts, and so will yield each of them a Wine of as different\r\na relish from the rest, as one may expect to find among the several\r\nVarieties of the _French_ growth. The most forward of these kinds about\r\n_London_ ripen early in this Month, if the Season be good; but the later\r\nforts are not generally ripe till the end of the Month, or in _July._ The\r\nlater sorts are commonly the white Dutch, the Amber, and the\r\nWalnut-Goosberries, each of which has likewise a different fort of taste:\r\nof the Amber especially I have known an excellent Wine to be made. Again,\r\nwe must consider, that as to the time of their ripening, the diversity of\r\nSituations will forward or retard them a Fortnight or three Weeks; and\r\nbeside, as we have observed above, every Season is not alike, and we must\r\nhave regard also to the difference of Climate, one part of _Britain_ is\r\nthree Weeks sooner or later than another: and when I say in any one of my\r\nKalendars, or Monthly Directories, that any particular Fruit is ripe, or\r\nany particular thing is to be done in such a Month, it must be understood\r\nthat it is generally so, but will vary now and then, as the Season is more\r\nor less forward. There is likewise another thing to be consder'd relating\r\nto the ripeness of Fruits, and that is, the different Opinions or Tastes of\r\nMankind; some call them ripe when they just begin to turn: but what I mean\r\nby ripeness, is, when a Fruit is as tender as it can be, and possessing its\r\nhighest Flavour: And by those Fruits which I call half ripe, I mean such as\r\nhave their inward Juices sweet, and their outward Parts a little hard and\r\nsour. In this state should the Goosberry be gather'd for making of Wine,\r\nSee the following Receipt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Goosberry-Wine.\r\n\r\nGather your Goosberries in dry Weather, when they are half ripe, as I have\r\nexplained in the above Preliminaries, pick them and bruise them in a Tub,\r\nwith a wooden Mallet, or other such like Instrument, for no Metal is\r\nproper; then take about the quantity of a Peck of the bruised Goosberries,\r\nput them into a Bag made of Horse-Hair, and press them as much as possible,\r\nwithout breaking the Kernels: repeat this Work till all your Goosberries\r\nare press'd, and adding to this press'd Juice, the other which you will\r\nfind in the Tub, add to every Gallon three Pounds of powder Sugar, for\r\n_Lisbon_ Sugar will give the Wine a taste which may be disagreeable to some\r\nPeople, and besides it will sweeten much more than the dry powder Sugar;\r\nstir this together till the Sugar is dissolved, and then put it in a Vessel\r\nor Cask, which must be quite fill'd with it. If the Vessel holds about ten\r\nor twelve Gallons, it must stand a Fortnight or three Weeks; or if about\r\ntwenty Gallons, then about four or five Weeks, to settle, in a cool Place:\r\nthen draw off the Wine from the Lee, and after you have discharg'd the\r\nVessel from the Lees, return the clear Liquor again into the Vessel, and\r\nlet it stand three Months, if the Cask is about ten Gallons; or between\r\nfour and five Months, if it be twenty Gallons, and then bottle it off. We\r\nmust note, that a small Cask of any Liquor is always sooner ripe and fit\r\nfor drinking than the Liquor of a larger Cask will be; but a small Body of\r\nLiquor will sooner change sour, than that which is in a larger Cask. The\r\nWine, if it is truly prepared, according to the above Directions, will\r\nimprove every Year, and last several Years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreliminaries to the making of Currant Wine.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted, that tho' there are two sorts of Currants, which may be\r\nused for making of Wine, that is, the Red and the White; yet the Taste and\r\nGoodness will be the same, whether 'tis made of the White or the Red, for\r\nthey have both the same Qualities, except in the Colour. Observe also, that\r\nthe Fruit be gather'd in a dry time, and that if you make a large Quantity,\r\nit must stand longer in the Vessel, before bottling, than a small Quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Currant Wine.\r\n\r\nWhen your Currants are full ripe, gather them, and pick them from the\r\nStalks and weigh them, in order to proportion your Water and Sugar to them.\r\nWhen this is done, bruise them to pieces with your Hands, and add to every\r\nthree Pounds of Currants a Quart of Water, stirring all together, and\r\nletting it stand three Hours, at the end of which time, strain it off\r\ngently thro' a Sieve, and put your Sugar into your Liquor, after the rate\r\nof a Pound to every three Pounds of Currants. This Sugar should be powder\r\nSugar, for _Lisbon_ Sugar would give the Wine an ill Taste. Stir this well\r\ntogether, and boil it till you have taken off all the Scum, which will rise\r\nplentifully; set it then to cool, at least sixteen Hours, before you put it\r\ninto the Vessel. If you make the Quantity of twenty Gallons, it may stand\r\nin the Vessel three Weeks before it will be fit for bottling; and if you\r\nmake thirty Gallons, then it must stand a Month before it be bottled off,\r\nobserving then to put a small Lump of Sugar into every Bottle; it must be\r\nkept in a cool place, to prevent its Fretting. By this Method it will keep\r\ngood many Years, and be a very strong and pleasant Wine, at a very cheap\r\nrate.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to observe, that the same sort of Currant is not always of\r\nthe same Sweetness when it is ripe, those growing in the Shade will be less\r\nsweet than those that are more exposed to the Sun. And when the Summer\r\nhappens to be wet and cold, they will not be so sweet as in a dry warm\r\nSeason; therefore tho' the Standard of the above Receipt be one Pound of\r\nSugar to three Pounds of pick'd Currants, yet the Palate of the Person who\r\nmakes the Wine should be the Regulator, when the Sugar is put to the Juice,\r\nconsidering at the same time, that it is a Wine they are making, and not a\r\nSyrup. The Sugar is only put to soften and preserve the Juice, and too much\r\nwill make the Wine ropey.\r\n\r\nThis Season is proper for making Cherry Wine, the _Kentish_ and _Flemish_\r\nCherries being now full ripe, which are much the best for this purposes:\r\nThis is a very pleasant strong Wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Cherry Wine.\r\n\r\nGather your Cherries in dry Weather, when they are full ripe, pick them\r\nfrom the Stalks, and bruise them well with your Hands till they are all\r\nbroken; then put them into a Hair Bag, and press them till you have as much\r\nLiquor from them as will run without breaking the Stones. To every Gallon\r\nof this Juice, put one Pound of powder Sugar, and having stirr'd it well\r\ntogether, boil it and scum it as long as any Scum will rise; then set it in\r\na cool Place till it is quite cold, and put it into your Vessel, when it\r\nwill presently begin to work. When the Working is over, slop the Vessel\r\nclose, and let it stand four Months; if it holds the Quantity of twenty\r\nGallons, or more or less, as the Quantity happens to be, then bottle it\r\noff, putting a Lump of Loaf-Sugar into each Bottle. It will keep two or\r\nthree Years, if it be set in a cool Place.\r\n\r\nI have now done with the Wines that are to be made in this Month: I shall\r\nin the next place set down the Method of keeping or preserving Fruits for\r\nTarts all the Year about, as I had it from a very curious Person, in whose\r\nHouse I have seen it practised with extraordinary Success. The Fruits which\r\nare chiefly to be put up this Month, are Goosberries, Currants and\r\nCherries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo preserve Fruits for Tarts all the Year.\r\n\r\nThe Goosberries must be full grown, but not ripe, they must be gather'd in\r\ndry Weather, and pick'd clean of their Stalks and Tops; then put them into\r\nQuart Bottles, that are made on purpose, with large wide Necks, and cork\r\nthem gently with new sound Corks, and put them into an Oven after the Bread\r\nis drawn, letting them stand there till they have shrunk about a fourth\r\npart; observing to change them now and then, because those which you set at\r\nthe further part of the Oven, will be soonest done. When you find them\r\nenough, according to the above Direction, take them out, and immediately\r\nbeat the Corks in as tight as you can, and cut the Tops off even with the\r\nBottles, and pitch them over; you must then set your Bottles by, in a dry\r\nPlace. I have tasted of Fruits done this way, that have made as good Tarts\r\nat the Year's end, as those that were fresh gather'd: The only difference\r\nbetween the preserving Goosberries and Currants, is, that the Currants must\r\nbe full ripe when we put them into the Bottles, and so likewise the\r\nCherries.\r\n\r\nThere is another way of putting up Fruits for this use, which is, by half\r\npreserving them with Sugar, _i.e._ half a Pound of Sugar to every Pound of\r\nFruit. Apricots especially, when they are near ripe, make excellent Tarts;\r\nbeing split and pared from the Skin, and boiled in a Syrup, they will keep\r\nthe Year round, as an ingenious Lady has told me. It is also to be\r\nremark'd, that ripe Goosberries make very fine Tarts.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of this Month, when the Goosberries are full grown, but not\r\nripe, is the right Season for preserving of them in sweet-meat: The white\r\n_Dutch_ Goosberry is the best for this use.\r\n\r\nSo likewise if you have plenty of _Kentish_ Cherries, pick some of them\r\nfrom the Stalks, and lay the Cherries upon a fine Wire Sieve, and dry them\r\nin an Oven; when they are dried enough, and quite cold, put them in an\r\nEarthen glazed Jar, and stop them up close: These must be kept in a dry\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nUpon the foot of the above Receipt, for preserving of Fruits, I have a\r\nNotion that we may preserve green Pease, after the same manner, in Bottles,\r\nthat I have mention'd for the preserving of Goosberries, Currants, _&c._ So\r\nthat they will eat tender and well tasted at _Christmas:_ it is well worth\r\nthe tryal, seeing that a Bottle or two cannot be any great Expence, and\r\nthat Pease are acceptable almost to every one. This I have persuaded some\r\nof my Acquaintance to try, but particularly a very curious Person in such\r\nmatters, who tells me, that provided this method answers what we aim at, he\r\nsupposes they will be the most agreeable, either to be boiled with Cream,\r\nor stew'd in Gravey, after the _French_ manner, for it is a dispute with\r\nhim, whether they will hold their green Colour; but, as I observ'd before,\r\nit may be try'd at an easy Expence.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of this Month is the time to pickle Walnuts, for then the\r\nWalnuts have not began to shell, and moreover are not so bitter nor hollow\r\nas they will be afterwards; they will now be full flesh'd, and you will\r\nhave no Loss. The following Method I learnt from Mr. _Foord,_ a curious\r\nGentleman of _Buckingham,_ and has been experienced to be the best way.\r\nThere is one thing indeed which must be regarded in this Pickle, which is,\r\nthat every one does not love the Taste of Onion or Garlick; but that may be\r\nomitted as we please, only supplying the place with Ginger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo pickle Walnuts.\r\n\r\nThe Walnuts being fit for pickling, wash them, and put them into a Kettle\r\nto scald; then with a piece of Flannel rub off the outer Skin, and let them\r\nlie till they are quite cold, after which put them into a Vessel of Salt\r\nand Water, and let them stand 24 Hours; then take them out, and put them\r\nagain into fresh Salt and Water for 24 Hours more; then shift them as\r\nbefore, and continue this Practice for fourteen Days, at the end of which\r\ntime wipe them dry, and lay them in a glazed earthen Pot, _Stratum super\r\nStratum,_ with Spice, whole Mustard-Seed, Horse-Radish slic'd, and Garlick,\r\nor Eschalots: that is to say, make a Layer of Walnuts, and strew over it\r\nwhole Pepper, Ginger slic'd, Horse-Radish slic'd, some whole Mustard-Seed,\r\nand three or four Cloves of Garlick; or if Garlick be too strong, as many\r\nCloves of Shalots. Then lay upon these another Layer of Walnuts, and upon\r\nthem the Roots and Spices as before, and so continue till your Pot is full;\r\nthen pour over the whole, as much boiling Vinegar as will cover them, and\r\nimmediately cover the Pot close, and let it stand till the next Day, when\r\nwe may again pour off the Vinegar from them, without disturbing them; and\r\nmaking it again boiling hot, pour it upon them, and stop them close, as\r\nbefore, to be set by for use. But these will not be fit for eating under\r\nthree Weeks or a Month, and will be much better by keeping a few Months.\r\n\r\nThis Month is a proper time to make Syrup of Clove-Julyflowers, and\r\nlikewise to make Julyflower Wine, which is a very rich Liquor, and may be\r\nmade in the best manner, by the following Receipt from Mrs. B. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Julyflower Wine.\r\n\r\nTake nine Gallons of Water, and twenty four Pounds of Sugar, boil these on\r\na gentle Fire till one Gallon is lost, or evaporated, taking off the Scum\r\nas it rises. Then having prepared a Bushel of Clove Julyflowers, the red\r\nFlower Leaves only, pour the Liquor scalding hot upon them, and cover them\r\nclose till the next Day, then pressing them with a Screw-press. When this\r\nis done, bake a piece of Bread hard, without scorching, before the Fire,\r\nand while it is warm, spread some Ale-Yeast upon it, and put it into the\r\nLiquor, in an open Tub, till it begins to worker ferment; the next Day\r\nafter which, add two quarts of Sack, and one of _Rhenish_ Wine, and barrel\r\nit for three Weeks or a Month; let it then be bottled, and kept in a cool\r\nPlace.\r\n\r\nIn this Month such Carp and Tench are good as have not lately spawn'd; the\r\ndressing of them, and of Pikes, or Jacks, see in _March_. Perch are now\r\nvery good, the large ones for stewing, as recommended for Carp, or boiled\r\nor fry'd, or else in the _Dutch_ manner, call'd Water Soochy; which is to\r\nboil the Perches with Salt in the Water, and Parsley-Roots and Parsley\r\nLeaves, to be brought to Table in the Water they are boiled in, and eaten\r\nwith Bread and Butter. 'Tis an odd way to the _English_, but is much\r\nadmir'd by many Genlemen who have travell'd.\r\n\r\nThe Garden is now very rich in Eatables, as may be seen in my _Gardener's\r\nKalendar_, printed for Mr. _Mears_.\r\n\r\nThe Trasopogon, or Goatsbeard, is now, as well as in the former Month, fit\r\nfor boiling; it is in much request in some of the Western parts of\r\n_England_, especially about _Bristol_, as I am inform'd, where the Country\r\nPeople call it Trangompoop, or Crangompoop, a corruption, as I suppose,\r\nfrom the true Name above written: This is eaten like Asparagus, and dress'd\r\nthe same way, the part which is eaten is the blossomy Bud a little before\r\nit would flower, with about six Inches of the Stalk to it.\r\n\r\nThere are now Chickens, Pigeons, Ducks, and some young wild Ducks, and\r\nRabbets, which may not only make great Variety at a Table, to be drest\r\nafter the common plain way, but may also be made into elgant Dishes, after\r\nthe several manners mention'd in this Work, if there is an occasion to\r\nentertain particular People of fine Taste.\r\n\r\nThe Ronceval and Mooretto Pease, and _Windsor_ Beans, are also good helps\r\nto a Table: I need say nothing of their dressing; but that I am of opinion,\r\nthat the _Windsor_ Beans, when they are blanch'd, that is, boiled long\r\nenough till we can take off their Skins, and then put into large-neck'd\r\nBottles, and order'd as I have prescrib'd for the preserving of Pease; by\r\nthis means I suppose they may be preserv'd many Months: but we may defer\r\nthis Experiment till the end of _September_, to be try'd upon the latter\r\nCrops.\r\n\r\nNear the Sea we have Mackrel in the height of perfection, and Mullet,\r\nTurbut, Herrings, Scate, and Soles, as also Lobsters and Crabs; and in the\r\nRivers, Salmon and Trout are still good, and some Cray-Fish.\r\n\r\n'Tis now a proper Season to put up Rasp-berries, either in Sweetmeat, or to\r\ninfuse in Brandy; but they must be gather'd dry. There are certain People\r\nwho know how to mix these with _Port_ Wine, and imitate the richest\r\n_Florence_ Wine.\r\n\r\nAbout _Midsummer_ is a proper time to put up a Boar for Brawn against\r\n_Christmas_, or against the beginning of _December_, for then is the Season\r\nit sells best, and is chiefly in request, selling at that time for twelve\r\nPence _per_ Pound.\r\n\r\nFor this end we should chuse an old Boar, for the older he is, the more\r\nhorny will the Brawn be: We must provide for this use a Frank, as the\r\nFarmers call it, which must be built very strong to keep the Boar in. The\r\nfigure of the Frank should be somewhat like a Dog-Kennel, a little longer\r\nthan the Boar, which we put up so close on the Sides that the Boar cannot\r\nturn about in it; the Back of this Frank must have a sliding Board, to open\r\nand shut at pleasure, for the conveniency of taking away the Dung, which\r\nshould be done every Day. When all this is very secure, and made as\r\ndirected, put up your Boar, and take care that he is so placed, as never to\r\nsee or even hear any Hogs; for if he does, he will pine away, and lose more\r\ngood Flesh in one Day than he gets in a Fortnight: He must then be fed with\r\nas many Pease as he will eat, and as much skim'd Milk, or flet Milk, as is\r\nnecessary for him. This method must be used with him till he declines his\r\nMeat, or will eat very little of it, and then the Pease must be left off,\r\nand he must be fed with Paste made of Barley Meal, made into Balls as big\r\nas large Hen-Eggs, and still the Skim-Milk continued, till you find him\r\ndecline that likewise, at which time he will be fit to kill for Brawn; the\r\nDirections for making of which, with the Pickle for it, see in the Month of\r\n_December_. During the time he is thus feeding, great care must be taken\r\nthat he has always Meat before him, for neglect in this will spoil the\r\nwhole Design.\r\n\r\nThis is the way of feeding a Boar for Brawn, but I cannot help thinking\r\n'tis a little barbarous, and especially as the Creature is by some People\r\nput in so close a Pen, that as I hear, it cannot lie down all the while\r\n'tis feeding; and at last, considering the expence of Food, Brawn is but an\r\ninsipid kind of Meat: however, as some are lovers of it, it is necessary to\r\nprescribe the method which should be used in the preparing it.\r\n\r\nIn this Month we have plenty of Artichokes and it is a good Season to put\r\nthem up for Winter use, to be used simply, or to be put in Sauces, or in\r\ncompound Dishes; they are easily dried or pickled, to be kept, and if they\r\nare not gather'd as soon as they are in their perfection, they will lose\r\nthe goodness of their Hearts, or the Bottoms, as some call them. In a\r\nplentiful Year of them I have had a great number dried for Winter use, in\r\nthe following manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConcerning the gathering, and ordering Artichokes for drying.\r\n\r\nIn the gathering of Artichokes, observe, that the Leaves of what is call'd\r\nthe Artichoke be pointing inwards, and lie close at the Top, for then the\r\nBottom will be large and full; but if you find many of the Leaves of the\r\nArtichoke spread from the Top, then the Choke, or bristly part is shot so\r\nmuch, that it has drawn out much of the Heart of the Artichoke; and as the\r\nFlower comes forward, the more that grows, the thinner will be the Bottom,\r\nwhich is the best part of it.\r\n\r\nWhen you cut the Artichoke, cut it with a long Stalk, that when you use it\r\nyou may clear it well of its Strings, which will else spoil the goodness of\r\nthe Bottom, wherein the Strings will remain; to do this, lay the Artichoke\r\nupon a Table, and hold it down hard with one Hand, while with the other\r\nHand you pull the Stalk hard up and down, till it quits the Artichoke, and\r\nwill then pull away the Strings along with it; this being done, lay the\r\nArtichokes in Water for an Hour, and then put them into a Kettle of cold\r\nWater to boil, till they are tender enough to separate the Leaves and the\r\nChokes from them. When this is done, lay the Hearts, or Bottoms upon a\r\nCullender, or some other thing, to drain conveniently; then dry them upon a\r\nWire Sieve, or Gridiron, in a gentle Oven, by degrees, till they are as\r\nhard as Wood. These will keep good twelve Months if they are laid by in a\r\ndry Place.\r\n\r\nWhen we want to use these for boiling, frying, or to accompany other Meats,\r\nwe must put them into warm Water, often repeating it to them for eight and\r\nforty Hours, by which means they will come to themselves, and be as good\r\nwhen they come to be scalded as if they were fresh gather'd. But they may\r\nalso be preserv'd after the following manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond Way to preserve Artichokes.\r\n\r\nHaving chosen your Artichokes according to the above Directions, cut the\r\nBottoms, with a sharp Knife, clear of their Leaves and their Chokes,\r\nflinging them immediately into cold Water, to prevent their turning black.\r\nWhen they have lain in the Water for seven or eight Minutes, wash them and\r\ndrain them a little, and then fling them into Wheat or Barley Flower, so\r\nthat they be all over cover'd with it; after which, lay them upon Wire\r\nSieves, or Pieces of Wicker-work to dry in an Oven gently, till they are\r\nquite dry and hard: these must be kept in a dry Place, and when they are to\r\nbe used, steep them in Water four and twenty Hours, and boil them till they\r\nare tender, they will eat as well as if they were fresh cut.\r\n\r\nThe Artichoke may likewise be pickled in the following manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo preserve Artichokes by Pickling.\r\n\r\nGather and prepare your Artichokes as before, and put them into cold Water\r\nto boil, with a moderate quantity of Salt; then take them off the Fire, and\r\nlet the Water stand in the Kettle for a quarter of an hour, till the Salt\r\nis settled to the bottom; then pour off your Water clear into an Earthen\r\nglazed Vesel where you design to put your Artichokes, and clearing them\r\nfrom the Leaves and Choaks, wash them well in two or three Waters, and put\r\nthem in the Brine or Pickle they were boiled in, when both are quite cold;\r\nupon which pour as much Oil as will cover it half an Inch thick, or where\r\nOil is wanting, melted Butter will serve: be sure you put so much as will\r\nkeep the Air from the Artichokes. Some will add some Vinegar to the Water,\r\nbut that is at pleasure; when this is done, cover the top of the Earthen\r\nPot close with Paper, and lay a Board over it to keep it from any Air, or\r\nelse cover the Pot with a wet Bladder, and tie it down close. They will\r\nkeep good a Year, and when we want to use them, lay them to steep in cold\r\nWater to take out the Salt; you may shift the Water three or four times,\r\nthey will be the better for it, and then use them in Pyes, or other\r\ncompound Dishes.\r\n\r\nIn _Holland_ I have often eaten the small Suckers of Artichokes fry'd,\r\nwhich have made an agreeable Dish. The Receipt for preparing them is the\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo fry small Suckers of Artichokes, or small Artichokes.\r\n\r\nGather the young Heads of Artichokes, and boil them with Salt and Water\r\ntill they are tender; these Artichokes should be no bigger than middling\r\nApples; split these in four or six Parts each, flower them well, and fry\r\nthem crisp in Hogs-lard, and eat them with Butter, Pepper, and a little\r\nVerjuice or Orange-Juice.\r\n\r\nIt is a common practice in _France_ to eat the small Heads of Artichokes\r\nraw, with Vinegar, Pepper, and Salt; the Method is to pull off the single\r\nLeaves, and dip the fleshy part of the Leaves into it and eat that. They\r\nare agreeably bitter, and create an Appetite.\r\n\r\nThis Month Rasberries are ripe; and as they make a most pleasant Wine, I\r\nshall here give the Receipt for making it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Rasberry Wine.\r\n\r\nTo every Quart of the Juice of Rasberries, put a Pint of Water, and to\r\nevery Quart of Liquor a Pound of fine Sugar; then set it on the Fire to\r\nboil half an hour, taking off the Scum as it rises: then set it to cool,\r\nand when it is quite cold, put it in a Vessel and let it stand ten Weeks or\r\nsomething more if the Weather prove cold; when it is settled, bottle it,\r\nand it will keep two Years. Altho' I have set down in this Month a good\r\nexperienced way of making Goosberry Wine, which will keep twenty Years, and\r\ngrow better by Age; yet I cannot pass by a Receipt which is highly\r\ncommended for making Wine of Red Goosberries, which I had from an\r\nAcquaintance who frequently makes it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Red Goosberry Wine.\r\n\r\nWhen the Red Goosberries are well colour'd and not over-ripe, but grateful\r\nto the Taste, gather them in a dry Day; take a Peck of these, and slit them\r\na little more than half thro' the middle, putting them into a large glazed\r\nEarthen Pan, with eight Pounds of fine powder'd Sugar strew'd over them;\r\nthen boil four Gallons of Cyder, and pour it boiling hot upon the Sugar and\r\nGoosberries: this must stand eight or ten Days, stirring it once each Day,\r\nand at length strain it thro' a Flannel in a Press, and put the Liquor into\r\nthe Vessel with a warm Toast of Wheat-bread, spread on both sides with\r\nAle-Yeast; this must stand two or three Months till it is fine, and then\r\nbottle it. This is a very strong Wine, and of a bright red Colour.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJULY.\r\n\r\nThis Month is the principal Season for pickling of Cucumbers, for that\r\nFruit is now in the greatest Perfection, as well for pickling them in\r\nimitation of Mango's, or as Girkins. They are now to be had in great\r\nplenty, and are free from Spots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is an extraordinary Receipt for pickling of Cucumbers to\r\nimitate Mango's.\r\n\r\nGather large Cucumbers of as green a Colour as may be, wash them well in\r\ncommon Water, and then either cut off their Tops, and scoop out all the\r\nseedy part, or else cut a Slice out of the Side of each of them, and scrape\r\nout the seedy part with a small Spoon, taking care not to mismatch the\r\nSlices or Tops of the Cucumbers, that they may tie up the better when we\r\ncome to fill them with Spices, _&c_. When we have thus prepared enough to\r\nfill the Jar or Earthen Vessel which we design for them, peel some Garlick\r\nor Shalots, which you like best, and put either two Cloves of Shalot into\r\neach Cucumber, or one middling Clove of Garlick; and also into every one\r\nput a thin slice or two of Horse-radish, a slice of Ginger, and, according\r\nto custom, a Tea Spoonful of whole Mustard-seed; but, in my opinion, that\r\nmay be left out. Then putting on the tops of the Cucumbers, or the Slices\r\nthat were cut out of them, tie them close with strong Thread, and place\r\nthem in your Jar. Then prepare your Pickle of Vinegar, which we suppose to\r\nbe about five Quarts to two dozen of large Cucumbers, to which put about a\r\nPound of Bay-Salt, half an Ounce of whole Pepper, about an Ounce of Ginger\r\nsliced, and a large Root of Horse-radish sliced; boil these in a brass\r\nSauce-pan for about fifteen Minutes, taking off the Scum as it rises, and\r\nthen pour it upon your Cucumbers, and cover the top of the Vessel with a\r\ncoarse Linnen Cloth four or five times double, and set the Vessel near the\r\nFire to keep warm; the day following you will find them changed to a yellow\r\nColour, but that will alter in a day or two to be much greener than they\r\nwere at first, if you use the following Method: Pour all your Pickle into a\r\nbrass Skellet, and add to it a piece of Allum as big as a Walnut, and set\r\nit over the Fire till it boils, then pour it on your Cucumbers as before,\r\nand repeat the same every day till the Cucumbers are of the Greenness you\r\ndesire. When you have pour'd on your Pickle for the last time, the Jar must\r\nbe cover'd as before, but remain without Corking till it is quite cold,\r\nthen stop it close and set it by, in a dry place. The Corks for the\r\nstopping of these Jars should be cover'd with soft glove-leather, for the\r\nnaked Corks will make the Pickles musty. See the Mango's made of green\r\nMelons in the Month of _September_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo preserve Green Cucumbers for slicing in the Winter, by Mr. _Foord_ of\r\n_Buckingham._\r\n\r\nGather Cucumbers half grown, that is, before they incline to be seedy, put\r\nthem in Salt and Water for five or six days, shifting it every day; then\r\nwipe them dry, and put them in Vinegar with a little Allum to green over\r\nthe fire; then take out the Cucumbers, and boil the pickle to pour hot upon\r\nthem, covering the Mouth of the Jar with a coarse Cloath four or five times\r\ndoubled, and let the Jar stand near the fire. When this Pickle is quite\r\ncold, stop the Jar close with a leather'd Cork, as mention'd in the\r\nforegoing Receipt for Mango Cucumbers. These Cucumbers may be used in the\r\nWinter to be pared and sliced like those gather'd fresh from the Garden;\r\nyou may cut an Onion with them, and eat them with Pepper, Vinegar and Oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Pickle Cucumbers, from Mr. _Foord_ of _Buckingham._\r\n\r\nGather the smallest Cucumbers you can find, for it is the smallest Size,\r\nwhich is most commonly brought to table among People of the first Rank;\r\ntho' a Cucumber of two Inches long will do very well, or even one of three\r\nInches. These must be put in Salt and Water, to be shifted every day till\r\nthey change to a yellow colour: wipe them dry, and prepare Pickle of\r\nVinegar, a piece of Allum as big as a Wallnut to a gallon, or in\r\nproportion, Ginger diced, Mace, whole Pepper, a few Bay-leaves, and some\r\nDill-Seed, which will do better than the Herb it self. Tye the Seeds in a\r\npiece of Muslin, that when the Pickle by boiling is strong enough of the\r\nDill, you may take it out. This Pickle, when it is of a right flavour, must\r\nbe pour'd boiling hot upon the Cucumbers, which must be laid in a Stone Jar\r\nor Gallypot proper for them, and then cover'd with a coarse Linnen Cloth\r\nfolded in several Doubles, and let them stand near the fire: Repeat the\r\nboiling of the Pickle every day, pouring it hot upon the Cucumbers, and\r\ncovering them as before, till they become of the green colour you desire.\r\nWhen they are quite cold, stop them up close with a leather'd Cork, as\r\ndirected in the former Receipt, if you use a Jar, or else if you make use\r\nof a Gallypot, tye them down with Leather or a wet Bladder. It is to be\r\nunderstood, that Allum and boiling Vinegar will strike a green colour to\r\nany unripe Fruit; but care must be taken that too much Allum be not used,\r\nleft the stomach be offended by it. It is a custom in some places to pickle\r\nthe green Pods of _Capsicum Indicum_ with their Cucumbers, which will\r\ncontribute to make them much hotter or warmer to the Stomach, and promote\r\nDigestion in cold Constitutions. But the _Capsicums_ should be boiled in\r\nWater gently, and wiped dry, before you put them among the Cucumbers, where\r\nthey must be placed before the Pickle is poured upon them.\r\n\r\nKidney-Beans are pickled the same way as the Cucumbers, only leaving out\r\nthe Dill; and the Dill also may be left out of the Cucumber-Pickle, if it\r\nis not agreeable to the Palate; and so likewise in other Pickles, Garlick\r\nor Onions, or any particular Spice may be left out which is disagreeable,\r\nfor it is not the business here to pin down the Palate of any one to a\r\ncertain Relish that I may like my self, but to put it in the power of every\r\none to preserve or order such things as a Farm or Garden affords, so that\r\nthey may be pleased with them. The Receipts which I have here given, are\r\nwhat I have generally found to be the most approved. We have some who\r\npickle the green Fruit of the Passion-Tree, the Berougella, and Fig: but\r\nfor my part I can find nothing to recommend them, but the relish of the\r\nPickle, neither are they by any means wholesome.\r\n\r\nThe Flowers of the _Nasturtium Indicum_ make an excellent Sallad in this\r\nMonth, and the Seeds of the Plant, while they are green, may be pickled to\r\nour satisfaction: the Receipt for pickling them is as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo pickle Nasturtium Seeds.\r\n\r\nGather the Seeds when they are full grown and green, in a dry day, and lay\r\nthem in Salt and Water for two or three days; then boil Vinegar, with some\r\nMace, Ginger sliced, and a few Bay-Leaves, for fifteen Minutes, and pour it\r\nboiling hot upon them, covering them with a Cloth, as prescribed in this\r\nMonth for the other Pickles, and repeat the boiling of the Pickle, and\r\nscalding them with it for three days successively; and when the last is\r\npoured on, let it be cold before you cork it up. The folded Cloth which\r\nshould be put over the Mouth of the Jar, will suffer some of the Steam of\r\nthe Pickle to pass thro' it, and by that means the Pickles will not turn\r\nmouldy, so soon as they might otherwise do, and besides will be much\r\ngreener than if they were to be close stopped. All these Pickles should be\r\nkept in a dry Place, and look'd into every Month, lest by chance they turn\r\nmouldy; which if you find they incline to, boil the Pickle afresh, and pour\r\nit on them as before.\r\n\r\nThere is now the Skerret fit to be eaten; it is a very nourishing and\r\npleasant Root, and is prepared in the following manner for the Table: the\r\nCulture of it is set forth at large in my new _Improvements of Planting and\r\nGardening_, printed for Mr. _Mears_, near _Temple-Bar_,\r\n\r\nThe Skerret, tho' it is none of the largest Roots, yet is certainly one of\r\nthe best Products of the Garden, if it be rightly dress'd; the way of doing\r\nwhich, is to wash the Roots very well, and boil them till they are tender,\r\nwhich need not be very long. Then the Skin of the Roots must be taken off,\r\nand a Sauce of melted Butter and Sack pour'd over them. In this manner are\r\nthey serv'd at the Table, and eaten with the Juice of Orange, and some\r\nlikewise use Sugar with them, but the Root is very sweet of itself.\r\n\r\nSome, after the Root is boil'd, and the Skin is taken off, fry them, and\r\nuse the Sauce as above: So likewise the Roots of Salsify and Scorzoncra are\r\nto be prepared for the Table.\r\n\r\nThe Apple call'd the Codlin is in good perfection for scalding, the manner\r\nof doing which, that they may be brought to Table, of a fine green Colour,\r\nis as follows.\r\n\r\nGather your Codlins half grown, and without Spots, for if they are spotted,\r\nthey are commonly Worm-eaten; scald them in Water till the Skin will come\r\noff easily, then put them again into cold Water, and a small piece of Allum\r\nto green in a Brass Pan over the Fire; which they will soon do if they are\r\nkept close cover'd.\r\n\r\nThe following Receipt is sent me by a curious Person for pickling of\r\nCodlins, in imitation of Mango.\r\n\r\nGather Codlins green and near full grown, blanch them, that is, scald them\r\nin soft Water till the Skin will peel off, then prepare your Pickle of\r\nVinegar and Bay Salt, about a large Spoonful of Salt to a Quart of Vinegar,\r\nthree or four Cloves of Garlick, a quarter of an Ounce of Ginger sliced,\r\nand as much whole Pepper; boil this in a Brass Pan, with a piece of Allum\r\nas big as a Horse-Bean, for half a quarter of an hour, and pour it hot upon\r\nyour Codlins, covering the Mouth of the Jar with a Cloth, and let it stand\r\nby the Fire-side; boil the Pickle again the day following, and apply it as\r\nbefore, and repeat the same till your Codlins are as green as you desire,\r\nand when they are quite cold, cork them close, and set them by in a dry\r\nplace. There is one thing must however be observed in all these Picklings,\r\nwhich is, that if the Pickles do not come to their fine green Colour\r\npresently, by boiling often of the Pickle at first, yet by standing three\r\nor four Weeks, and then boiling the Pickle afresh, they will come to a good\r\nColour; and then your Pickles will eat the firmer and keep the longer, when\r\nthey are not too soon brought to Colour.\r\n\r\nIn this Month we have the Morello and Black Cherry ripe, which both are\r\npleasant in Brandy; to those who would have Drams by them, the way of\r\nmaking Black-Cherry Brandy, is only to pick the Cherries from the Stalks,\r\nand put them whole into the Brandy, about a Pound of Cherries to a Quart;\r\nthis may remain for about a Month before it is fit to drink, and then the\r\nBrandy may be pour'd from the Cherries, and the Cherries put then into a\r\nVessel of Ale will make it extremely strong, only about the proportion of a\r\nPound of Cherries to a Gallon of Ale; but some will put fresh Brandy to\r\nthem, and the Cherries will turn the Brandy of a deep Colour, and give it a\r\nstrong taste of Ratafia; others will distill these Cherries in a cold\r\nStill, with as much Water as will cover them, and draw a fine Cordial from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Visney.\r\n\r\nThis Visney is made of pure Brandy, and as many Morello Cherries as will\r\nfill the Bottles or Casks, with one Ounce of Loaf-Sugar to each full Quart;\r\nthese Vessels or Bottles must be gently stopp'd, when the Cherries are put\r\nin, and stand in a cool Cellar for two Months before the Liquor is poured\r\nfrom them, and then the Liquor may be put in small Bottles for use: It is\r\nnot very strong, but very pleasant. The Cherries, when they are taken out,\r\nmay be distill'd, and will yield a fine Spirit.\r\n\r\nIn some places, where there are Laurels grow wild, without Cutting or\r\npruning, I mean, the _Lauro-Cerasus_, as we find in many old Gardens, that\r\nPlant is apt to bear Berries, which in reality are Cherries, from whence it\r\nhas its Name; these Berries, or Cherries, are ripe about this time, and\r\nmake a fine Cordial, if we infuse them in Brandy for two or three Months\r\nwith a little Sugar; this will have a Flavour of Abricot Kernels, and be of\r\na rich red Colour. While I am speaking of this, I cannot help taking notice\r\nof a particular Dram which I tasted at a curious Gentleman's House at\r\n_Putney_ in _Surrey_, _W. Curtis _Esq; which he made by infusing of the\r\nCornelian Cherry in Brandy; that Gentleman is the only one who I think has\r\nyet tried it, and to my Palate it seems to be so like _Tockay_ Wine, that\r\nit must be a very good judge who can discover the difference. I have drank\r\nthat Wine in perfection, and this preparation has both the Colour, Taste,\r\nand Proportion of strength equal to it; for the great strength of the\r\nBrandy is lost in the Cornelian Cherry, and tho' the Cornelian Cherry is of\r\na bright red Colour, yet this Liquor is of the Colour of _Tockay_ Wine.\r\n\r\nThose who live near _London_, may, about this Season, buy Geese out of the\r\nFlocks, which are now drove up to that City, at about five and twenty, or\r\nthirty Shillings a score; and till the Season we are to turn them into the\r\nStubble, we may feed them chiefly with the Offals of the Garden, Lettuce\r\nespecially, which will fatten them, if you have enough: but as for their\r\nparticular Feed for fatting, I shall speak of that in another place.\r\n\r\nAbout this Season Abricots are ripe, and where there are plenty of them, we\r\nmay make a pleasant Wine with them. The following Receipt is a very good\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Apricot Wine. From Mrs. _J. L._\r\n\r\nTo every Quart of Water put a Pound and half of Apricots, that are not\r\nover-ripe, let them be wiped clean, and cut in pieces; boil these till the\r\nLiquor is strong of the Apricot Flavour; then strain the Liquor thro' a\r\nSieve, and put to every Quart four or five Ounces of white Sugar, boil it\r\nagain, and scum it as it rises, and when the Scum rises no more, pour it\r\ninto an Earthen Pot; the Day following bottle it, putting into every Bottle\r\na lump of Loaf-Sugar, as big as a Nutmeg. This will presently be fit for\r\ndrinking, is a very pleasant Liquor; but will not keep long.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAUGUST.\r\n\r\nIn this Month there are many Delicacies about a Country Seat; all kinds of\r\nPond-Fish are good, there is plenty of Poultry of all kinds, wild and tame,\r\nexcept the Water-Fowl, which should yet remain untouch'd. Turkey Poults,\r\nPheasant Poults, Partridges, and some sort of Pigeons, are good; but for\r\nthe most part the Dove-cote Pigeons are distemper'd, and are now full of\r\nKnots in their Skins, and unwholesome. The Eggs of Fowls likewise at this\r\nSeason, as well as in the former Month, are unhealthful. Towards the end,\r\nPork comes again in Season, and young Pigs also are pretty plentiful; 'tis\r\na good time likewise to save young Pigs to grow up for now you may turn\r\nthem with their Dams into the Stubbles, and soon after into the Woods.\r\nAbout the end of this Month, you have Rabbets full grown in common Warrens,\r\nand young wild Ducks; and those who live near the Sea, have plenty of\r\nOysters, and in great perfection, much better, in my opinion, than in the\r\nWinter. Hares are also now good, and Buck Venison is still good. Turnips,\r\nCarrots, Cabbages, Caulyflowers, Artichokes, Melons, Cucumbers, and such\r\nlike, are in prime; Sallary and Endive, _Nasturtium Indicum_ Flowers,\r\nCabbage Lettice, and blanch'd sweet Fennel is now good for Sallads. Peas\r\nand Beans, and Kidney-beans, are likewise to be met with, so that a Country\r\nGentleman and Farmer may have every thing at home, and let out a Table fit\r\nfor a Prince, without being beholden to the Markets; and the great variety\r\nof Fruits which this Season produces, renders it still more delightful and\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\nNow Elder-berries are ripe and fit for making of Wine, as well the white as\r\nthe red sort: these are both very good, if they are rightly managed. The\r\nfollowing drinks very much like the _French_ Wine call'd _Hermitage_, and\r\nis full as strong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make red Elder Wine.\r\n\r\nTake twenty Pounds of _Malaga_ Raisins pick'd and rubb'd clean, but not\r\nwash'd; shred them small, and steep them in five Gallons of Spring Water,\r\nputting the Water cold to them, and stirring them every day; then pass the\r\nLiquor thro' a Hair Sieve, pressing the Raisins with your Hands, and have\r\nin readiness six Pints of the Juice of Elder-Berries that have been first\r\npick'd from the Stalks, and then drawn by boiling the Berries in a glaz'd\r\nEarthen Pot, set in a Pan of Water over the Fire. Put this Juice cold into\r\nthe Liquor, stirring it well together, and then tunning it in a Vessel that\r\nwill just hold it, and let it stand six Weeks or two Months in a warm\r\nplace; then bottle it, and it will keep a Year if the Bottles are well\r\nstopp'd. Note, that the Elder-Berries must be full ripe, and gather'd in a\r\ndry day; and when you have tunn'd your Wine, let the place where you set it\r\nbe warm and dry, where no external Air is admitted, that it may ferment or\r\nwork duly, for that is a material point. If it be otherwise disposed, so\r\nthat it stands in a place which is subject to Heats and Cold, the Ferment\r\nwill stop upon Cold, or be too violent upon Heats; but in cold Weather put\r\nsome Straw about it. See more of the working of Liquors in _March_, in the\r\nArticle of Brewing, and likewise take care that your Bottles are dry when\r\nyou bottle your Wine, and that you have good Corks; take care likewise that\r\nyour Wine be clear before you bottle it, or it will be good for nothing. If\r\nthis Wine be rightly managed according to the above Directions, it will be\r\nfit for drinking after it has been bottled a Month.\r\n\r\nIn the making of white Elder-Wine, there is no difference if you make it\r\nwith Raisins; but it is much the best, in my Opinion, if you make it with\r\nSugar after the following manner: only it is to be consider'd, that white\r\nElder-Berries are yet very scarce, and there must be more of them used in\r\nthe Sugar Wine than in the Raisin Wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make white Elder-Wine, or red Elder-Wine, with Sugar.\r\n\r\nGather the Elder-Berries ripe and dry, pick them, bruise them with your\r\nHands, and strain them; then set the Liquor by in glaz'd earthen Vessels\r\nfor twelve hours to settle, then put to every pint of Juice a pint and half\r\nof Water, and to every Gallon of this Liquor put three Pounds of _Lisbon_\r\nSugar: set this in a Kettle over the Fire, and when it is ready to boil,\r\nclarify it with the Whites of four or five Eggs; let it boil an hour, and\r\nwhen it is almost cold, work it with some strong Ale-Yeast, and then tun\r\nit, filling up the Vessel from time to time with the same Liquor saved on\r\npurpose, as it sinks by working. In a Month's time, if the Vessel holds\r\nabout eight Gallons, it will be fine and fit to bottle, and after bottling,\r\nwill be fit to drink in two Months: but remember, that all Liquors must be\r\nfine before they are bottled, or else they will grow sharp and ferment in\r\nthe Bottles, and never be good for any thing.\r\n\r\n_N.B._ Add to every Gallon of this Liquor a Pint of strong Mountain Wine,\r\nbut not such as has the Borachio or Hogskin flavour. This Wine will be very\r\nstrong and pleasant, and will keep several Years.\r\n\r\nWe must prepare our Red Elder-Wine in the same manner that we make with\r\nSugar, and if our Vessel hold about eight or ten Gallons, it will be fit\r\nfor Bottling in about a Month; but if the Vessel be larger, it must stand\r\nlonger in proportion, three or four Months at least for a Hogshead.\r\n\r\nThis Month Barberries are ripe and fit for pickling; they make a pretty\r\nGarnish, and are prepared as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo pickle Barberries, or Pipperages, as call'd in some places.\r\n\r\nGather your Barberries in dry Weather, and lay them in their Bunches into\r\nan earthen glazed Pot, then boil a quantity of Water made strong with Salt,\r\nscumming it as it rises, and let it stand to be quite cold; then pour it\r\nupon the Barberries, so as to cover them an Inch, and cover it close. Some\r\nuse half Vinegar and half Water for this Pickle, but it is at every one's\r\npleasure, I think one is as good as the other.\r\n\r\nPartridges are now in Season, and are prepared after several manners; some\r\nof the principal are the following.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoil'd Partridges with stew'd Sallary, from Lady W------.\r\n\r\nThe Partridges being clean'd and trussed, boil them tender, and make the\r\nfollowing Sauce for them. Take half a score large Sallary Plants that are\r\nwell whiten'd or blanched, boil them first in Water and Salt, and then stew\r\nthem tender with Gravey, Salt, some Pepper, and a Spoonful or two of White\r\nwine; and when they are enough, thicken and brown the Sauce they are stew'd\r\nin with burnt Butter, lay your Sallary at the bottom of the Dish, and your\r\nPartridges upon that, then pour your Sauce over all, and garnish with\r\nLemmon or Orange slic'd. This is the method of stewing Sallary, which is an\r\nagreeable Plate of itself.\r\n\r\nFrom the same Lady I had the following Directions for roasted Partridges:\r\nPartridges which are designed for roasting may be larded with fine Bacon\r\nFat on the Breast, or roasted without larding; but in a Dish of these\r\nFowls, there should be some of one and some of the other. The Sauce for\r\nthem should be of two sorts, one of Gravey in the Dish with them, and the\r\nother of Bread in Saucers on the sides of the Dish. The Gravey is made of\r\nBeef, an Onion, a Bunch of sweet Herbs, some Salt and Pepper, stew'd half\r\nan hour together, in a little more Water than will cover them, then strain\r\noff the Liquor into the Dish.\r\n\r\nThe Pap-Sauce, or Bread-Sauce, is made of grated Crumb of Bread, boiled\r\nwith as much Water as will cover it, a little Butter, an Onion, and some\r\nwhole Pepper; this must be kept stirring often, and when it is very thick,\r\nwithdraw the Onion, and serve it in a Saucer with your Partridges. These\r\nSauces may likewise be served with Pheasants, or Quails. These may also be\r\nstew'd, farced, baked, or put in Soups, or used in Fricassees. Thus far the\r\nLady.\r\n\r\nHares begin now to be in Season, and are well dress'd by the following\r\nReceipt, which I purchased a few Years ago, at a noted Tavern in _London_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Hare and its Sauces.\r\n\r\nIf you kill a Hare by Coursing, you may keep it if the Weather be cool\r\nthree days before you roast it; or if it has been run hard by the Hounds,\r\nthen it will not keep so long. When the Skin is taken off, it is the\r\nfashion to leave the Ears on, but that is at pleasure; then truss it for\r\nRoasting, and take the Liver and boil it, and mince it very small; add to\r\nthis grated Bread, a little All-Spice, but fine, some butter'd Eggs, a\r\nlittle dry'd sweet Marjoram, with a Seasoning of Pepper and Salt at\r\ndiscretion, and some Parsley shred small: Mix this well together, and add\r\nthe Yolk of an Egg to it to bind it; then fill the Body of the Hare\r\nmoderately with this Farce, and sew up the Belly. When the Hare is first\r\nlaid down to the fire, put about three pints of Water with an Onion, some\r\nSalt and whole Pepper, in the Dripping-pan, and baste the Hare with this\r\ntill it is near roasted enough, and baste it with a piece of fat burning\r\nBacon, or in the place of that, common Butter; but the Bacon is best, if\r\nthe Person knows how to use it. When it is enough, pour the following Sauce\r\ninto the Dish with it: Take the Liquor, with the Onion and Pepper in the\r\nDripping-pan, out before you baste the Hare with Butter or Bacon, and boil\r\nit with a glass of Claret; it will be very rich when it comes to be mixt\r\nwith the Farce out of the Belly of the Hare, and is little trouble. You may\r\nthicken this with a little Butter and Flower, if you please.\r\n\r\nThe following is also a very good one: Take a pound of lean Beef, boil it\r\nin about three pints of Water with an Onion, a Bunch of sweet Herbs, some\r\nAll-spice, Pepper and Salt, till the Beef is boil'd half enough; then cut\r\nthe Beef in several places to let out the Gravey, and continue to boil all\r\nthose till the Liquor has lost a third part; then add a little Claret to\r\nit, and strain the Liquor through a Sieve, pouring the Gravey hot into the\r\nDish before you put the Hare in it; and when you lay in the Hare, cut away\r\nthe part that was sew'd up, or take away the thread that sew'd it. Some\r\nchuse to skewer up the Belly of the Hare, rather than sew it. You may serve\r\nthis with Lemmon sliced, and in a plate by it have the following Sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSweet Venison Sauce.\r\n\r\nTake half a pint of Claret, a little Stick of Cinnamon, and boil them\r\ntogether till the Flavour of the Cinnamon is in the Claret; then sweeten it\r\nto your mind with double-refined Loaf-sugar. Or else,\r\n\r\nGrate some Crumb of Bread, and put to it as much Claret as will make it\r\nlike thin Pap; add to this a small piece of Cinnamon, and boil it well,\r\nthen sweeten it with double-refined Loaf-sugar grated small. These are the\r\nsweet Sauces used for Hare, and all other Venison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo dress a Hare with White or Brown Sauce, from the late curious Mr.\r\n_Harrison_ of _Henley_ upon _Thames._\r\n\r\nCut your Hare in four or eight pieces, and slit the Head; fry it a little\r\nin Hog's Lard, and then put it to stew in an earthen glazed Vessel, with\r\nGravey, half a pint of White-wine, Pepper, Nutmeg, Salt, a bunch of sweet\r\nHerbs, and a slice or two of Lemmon-Peel; keep this close covered, and stew\r\nit gently till 'tis tender, then strain off the Sauce, and brown it with\r\nfry'd Flower, or burnt Butter: pour the Sauce hot over the Hare, and serve\r\nit With a Garnish of Lemmon in Slices; but if you would have your Sauce of\r\nbrighter Colour, instead of the burnt Butter, or fry'd Flower, thicken it\r\nwith the Yolks of three or four Eggs. This is an excellent way of dressing\r\na Hare, and more generally admired than any other.\r\n\r\nThis being the Season for taking Honey, I shall here set down the Method of\r\nmaking of Mead, after two ways, which are both extraordinary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Mead, from Lady _G._\r\n\r\nTake eight Gallons of Water, and as much Honey as will make it bear an Egg;\r\nadd to this the Rind of six Lemmons, and boil it well, scumming it\r\ncarefully as it rises. When 'tis off the Fire, put to it the Juice of the\r\nsix Lemmons, and pour it into a clean Tub, or open earthen Vessel, if you\r\nhave one large enough, to work three Days; then scum it well, and pour off\r\nthe clear into the Cask, and let it stand open till it has done making a\r\nhissing Noise; after which, stop it up close, and in three Months time it\r\nwill be fine, and fit for bottling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Hydromel, or Mead.\r\n\r\nTake eight Gallons of Water, and as much Honey as will make the Water bear\r\nan Egg; put to this a quarter of a pound of Cloves tied in three or four\r\npieces of Muslin or Linnen Cloth, and set it to boil till the Scum has done\r\nrising, scumming it as it rises; then take it off the Fire, and take out\r\nthe Cloves, which may be wash'd and dry'd for other Uses, and pour your\r\nMead into an open Tub to ferment for about three days, till the Violence of\r\nthe Working is over; after which, scum it very well, and pour the clear\r\ninto a Vessel, leaving the Bung open till it has done hissing, which you\r\nmay know by holding your Ear close to it, for at a distance you can hardly\r\ndiscover it. When this hissing is over, stop it close, and let it stand\r\nthree Months till it is fine, before you bottle it; remember in bottling\r\nthis, as well as all other Liquors, that the Bottles must be clean, and\r\nperfectly dry, and that every Bottle be well cork'd. This will keep good\r\nseveral Years.\r\n\r\nBesides this way of making Mead, there is another which I have approved to\r\nbe very good, which, in all particulars, except the Water, is the same with\r\nthis; and instead of the Water, put the like Quantity of small Ale-Wort,\r\nbrew'd with pale Malt: but this will require less Honey than the former,\r\nand will require more time in the Vessel before it is fine and fit to\r\nbottle; but it will last many Years good, and will drink like _Cyprus_ Wine\r\nwhen it is a Year old. In this Liquor, take particular care that your\r\nCloves are fresh and sound, for else you must add a Quantity in proportion.\r\n\r\n_N.B._ We may make these Meads in the Spring of the Year, as well as at\r\nthis Season; only the advantage of making it now, is, that you have an\r\nopportunity of washing the Honey-Combs after the Honey is run off, and\r\nthereby will save Expence in Honey.\r\n\r\nThe Potatoe now begins to be gather'd, and is a very useful Root, being\r\neither boil'd or roasted in hot Embers; and after it is boiled, to be\r\nbroiled, or after boiling it tender, and beaten in a Mortar, it is used to\r\nthicken Sauces, and for making of rich Puddings, as I am inform'd by a\r\nskilful Person in this way.\r\n\r\nThe Roots of red Beets now begin to come in season, and are very good\r\nboiled, and sliced, to be put in a Pickle of Vinegar only: thus you may\r\nkeep them to garnish Sallads of small Herbs, and in some Intervals put\r\nHorse-Radish scraped. These Roots will hold all the Winter. The Root of the\r\nred Beet makes an excellent Dish, prepared after the following manner,\r\nwhich I got abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo fry the Roots of Red Beets.\r\n\r\nWash your Beet-Roots, and lay them in an earthen glazed Pan, bake them in\r\nan Oven, and then peel the Skin off them: after this is done, slit them\r\nfrom the Top to the Tail, and cut them in the shape of the Fish call'd a\r\nSole, about the thickness of the third part of an Inch; dip these in a\r\nthick Batter, made of White-Wine, fine Flower, sweet Cream, the Whites and\r\nYolks of Eggs, rather more Yolks than Whites, some Pepper, Salt, and Cloves\r\nbeaten fine, all well mix'd. As you dip every piece of Beet-Root in this\r\nBatter, strew them over thick with fine Flower mix'd with grated Bread, and\r\nParsley shred small, and then fry them in Lard: when they are enough, let\r\nthem dry, and serve them with a Garnish of Lemmon. These likewise may be\r\nput about stew'd Carps, Tench, or roasted Jacks, by way of Garnish, with\r\nscraped Horse-Radish, and pickled Barberries.\r\n\r\nIn the Heats of this Month, the following Jelly is used by a curious\r\nGentleman abroad, who gave me the Receipt of it, under the Name of _The\r\nJelly of Health:_ It is of great use to weak People, and extremely\r\npleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make the Jelly of Health.\r\n\r\nTake some Calves Feet, according to the Jelly you design to make, and also\r\nget a Cock of the common Poultry kind; wash these well, and put them in a\r\nKettle to boil, with a proportionable Quantity of Water, particularly\r\ntaking off the Scum as it rises. When these Meats are boiled almost to\r\npieces, it is a sign that your Jelly is boiled enough; but take care that\r\nit is not too stiff, which you may try by taking a little out with a Spoon,\r\nand then setting it to cool. Then pour the Liquor thro' a Sieve into a\r\nStew-pan, and take off all the Fat; after which, put to the Liquor a\r\nproportionable Quantity of double-refined Loaf-Sugar, a small Stick or two\r\nof Cinnamon, three or four Cloves, and the Rinds of two or three Lemmons:\r\nboil all these together gently for about a quarter of an hour, till it is\r\nwell-tasted, and then beat up the Whites of four or five Eggs, with the\r\nJuice of the six Lemmons, and pour them into the Jelly, stirring the whole\r\na little time over the Fire; then let this Mixture stand still upon the\r\nFire till it rises ready to boil over; at which time, you must take it off,\r\nand pour it into the Jelly-Bag, and as it runs thro' into a Pan set to\r\nreceive it, pour it again into the Jelly-Bag for three or four times till\r\nit comes clear, and then let it drop into Jelly-Glasses. Sometimes, the\r\nabove Gentleman told me, he has put a little White-Wine into the Liquor\r\nwhile the Meats were boiling in it, which he thinks helps it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER.\r\n\r\nAs this Month produces great numbers of Mushrooms in the Fields, it is now\r\nchiefly that we ought to provide ourselves with them for making of Ketchup,\r\nand Mushroom Gravey: And it is also a proper Season for pickling them.\r\nIndeed, where we have Mushroom-Beds, we may do these Works at any time of\r\nthe Year. It is to be remark'd, that the best Mushrooms have their Gills of\r\na Flesh Colour, even while the Mushrooms are in button; and as they tend to\r\nspread in their Head, or to open their Cap, the Gills turn redder, till at\r\nlength, when their Heads are fully spread open, they will become quite\r\nblack. These large-flap Mushrooms are still good for stewing or broiling,\r\nso long as they have no Worms in them, and the Gills are then in the best\r\nstate for making Ketchup, or Mushroom-Gravey; altho' the red Gills will do,\r\nbut the smaller Buttons are what most People covet for Pickling.\r\n\r\nIn the gathering of Mushrooms, we are sure to meet with some of all sizes;\r\nthe very small for pickling, the large Buttons for stewing or making\r\nMushroom-Loaves, and Mushroom-Gravey, and the large Flaps for broiling or\r\nmaking of Ragous, or stewing, and Ketchup: therefore to follow the common\r\nway, we should make two or three Parcels of them.\r\n\r\nThe cleaning of Mushrooms, or preparing them for any of the above Uses,\r\nwill afford us nothing but what is useful; the Parings should be saved by\r\nthemselves, to be wash'd, towards the making of what is called Mushroom\r\nGravey; the Gills must be saved by themselves for making either Ketchup, or\r\nMushroom-Gravey; and the Parts towards the Roots, and the Roots themselves,\r\nmust be kept to dry in the Sun, or a warm Room, to raise Mushrooms from,\r\nespecially if they are of a large good sort that has red Gills, for those\r\nwhich have white Gills, prove oftentimes unwholesome, and are apt to turn\r\nyellow when they are cut and put in Water: however, some People eat of this\r\nsort, and I have eaten of such a sort myself; but as there are some with\r\nwhite Gills that are deadly, it is dangerous for unskilful Persons to\r\nmeddle with any of that fort: and therefore I thought it convenient when I\r\nwas in _France_, to learn the Method of raising them in Beds, that we might\r\nbe sure of our sort, and have them all the Year about: The Method of doing\r\nwhich, is in my _Appendix_ to my _New Improvements of Planting and\r\nGardening_, printed for Mr. _Mears_, at _Temple-Bar_.\r\n\r\nThe following Receipts for making of Mushroom-Ketchup, and Mushroom-Gravey,\r\nI had from a Gentleman named _Garneau_, whom I met at _Brussels_, and by\r\nExperience find them to be very good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Mushroom Ketchup.\r\n\r\nTake the Gills of large Mushrooms, such as are spread quite open, put them\r\ninto a Skellet of Bell-Metal, or a Vessel of Earthen-Ware glazed, and set\r\nthem over a gentle Fire till they begin to change into Water; and then\r\nfrequently stirring them till there is as much Liquor come out of them as\r\ncan be expected, pressing them often with a Spoon against the side of the\r\nVessel; then strain off the Liquor, and put to every Quart of it about\r\neighty Cloves, if they are fresh and good, or half as many more, if they\r\nare dry, or have been kept a long time, and about a Drachm of Mace: add to\r\nthis about a Pint of strong red _Port_ Wine that has not been adulterated,\r\nand boil them all together till you judge that every Quart has lost about a\r\nfourth Part or half a Pint; then pass it thro' a Sieve, and let it stand to\r\ncool, and when it is quite cold, bottle it up in dry Bottles of Pints or\r\nHalf-Pints, and cork them close, for it is the surest way to keep these\r\nkind of Liquors in such small quantities as may be used quickly, when they\r\ncome to be exposed to the Air, for fear of growing mouldy: _but I have had\r\na Bottle of this sort of Ketchup, that has been open'd and set by for above\r\na, Year, that has not received the least Damage_; and some Acquaintance of\r\nmine have made of the same sort, and have kept it in Quart-Botles to use as\r\noccasion required, and have kept it good much longer than I have done. A\r\nlittle of it is very rich in any Sauce, and especially when Gravey is\r\nwanting: Therefore it may be of service to Travellers, who too frequently\r\nmeet with good Fish, and other Meats, in Britain, as well as in several\r\nother parts of Europe, that are spoiled in the dressing; but it must be\r\nconsider'd, that there is no Salt in this, so that whenever it is used,\r\nSalt, Anchovies, or other such like relishing things, may be used with it,\r\nif they are agreeable to the Palate, and so likewise with the Mushroom\r\nGravey in the following Receipt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Mushroom Gravey.\r\n\r\nWhen you clean your Mushrooms, save the Parings, and wash them well from\r\nthe Dirt, and then put to them the Gills that have been scraped from the\r\nlarge Buttons, and with a very little Water put them in a Saucepan, and\r\nstir them frequently till you have got all the juice from them; then strain\r\nthe Liquor from them, and set it by to cool, or else till you have stew'd\r\nthe Mushrooms that they were taken from, and then add the Liquor of the\r\nstew'd Mushrooms to the aforesaid Liquor, and boil them both together, with\r\nabout 80 Cloves, about a Drachm of Mace, and two Drachms of whole Pepper to\r\neach Quart of Liquor, which will be lit to take off the Fire when it has\r\nlost about a third part by boiling; then pass it thro' a dry Sieve, into a\r\ndry earthen Pan, and let it stand till it be quite cold before you bottle\r\nit, observing then that the Bottles be very dry, for if they happen to be\r\nwet, it will soon turn mouldy. When the Bottles are fill'd, cork them well\r\nwith sound new Corks, and tye a piece of Bladder, that has been softened in\r\nwarm Water, over every Cork as tight as possible, and set the Bottles in a\r\ndry Place; with this management it will keep a long time.\r\n\r\nWhat I learn'd else from the above mention'd Gentleman, concerning the\r\npreparing of Mushrooms for eating, was, that they should be always used\r\nwhen they are fresh gather'd, and then only such as are without Worms,\r\nwhich may be easily perceived by cutting their Stems cross-wise; and also\r\nthat as soon as the Peel is pared off, and the Gills, let the large\r\nMushrooms be cut into pieces, of the bigness of Nutmegs, and thrown into\r\nWater, as well the Stems as the Caps, for they are both good; then wash\r\nthem well, and stew them a Sauce-pan, without putting any Liquor to them,\r\nor Spice, or Salt, till they have discharged a great deal of their own\r\nLiquor, and, begin to grow tender; you will then find them shrink into a\r\nvery narrow compass, and must have the greatest part of the Liquor poured\r\nfrom them, with which you may make the Mushroom-Gravey abovemention'd. The\r\nMushrooms being thus prepared, put to them a Seasoning of Pepper, Salt,\r\nMace, and such other Ingredients as will not rob the Mushrooms too much of\r\ntheir own natural Flavour, and stir them frequently till they are enough;\r\nthen put a little White-wine and Butter to them, and they will make an\r\nexcellent good Dish: or else they may be made brown with some burned\r\nButter, or be made into a Ragout. As for the broiling of the Caps of the\r\nlarge Mushrooms, the same Person's Receipt directs to rub the Caps with\r\nButter on both sides, and strew Pepper and Salt on them, and broil them\r\ntill they are quite hot through, turning them two or three times on the\r\nFire, they will make their own Sauce when they come to be cut. Another way\r\nwhich he directs, is to make a pretty thick Batter of Flower, Water, or\r\nMilk and Eggs beaten together with some Salt and Pepper, to dip them in,\r\nand then fry them like Tripe; and for their Sauce, he recommends Butter, a\r\nlittle White-wine, and some of the Mushroom-Gravey, to be well mix'd\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nSome of my Acquaintance, who have try'd these Directions, approve of them;\r\nand, for my own part, I think them as agreeable as any that I have eaten:\r\nbut as the Taste is not alike in every one, I shall add an Observation or\r\ntwo more of Monsieur _Garneau's_, concerning the Mushroom, which I think\r\nnot unworthy our notice. The Mushroom, says that Gentleman, is not only a\r\ngood Groundwork for all high Sauces, but itself a good Meat to be dress'd\r\nafter any manner, either to compose a white or brown Fricassee, or fry'd or\r\nbroil'd, or baked in Pyes with common Seasoning, and stands in the room of\r\nFlesh better than any thing that has yet been found out.\r\n\r\nThis Month is likewise a good time, if it is not over-wet, to gather\r\nMushroooms for drying; but they should chiefly be such as are newly open'd\r\nin their Caps, before the Gills turn black. For this end, take off the\r\nGills very clean, and wipe the Caps with wet Flannel, and as soon as they\r\nare a little dry, run a String through them, and hang them at some distance\r\nfrom the Fire, turning them now and then till they are dry enough to be\r\nreduced to Powder. When they are thus dry'd, keep them in dry Bottles with\r\nwide Necks, close stopp'd, till you have occasion to use them in Sauces.\r\nKeep this in a dry place. Some dry them in Ovens after the Bread is drawn,\r\nbut an Oven in its full heat will be too strong for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo pickle Mushrooms White.\r\n\r\nTake a Quart of small Buttons of Mushrooms, cut off their Roots, and wash\r\nthem well with a Flannel dipt in Water, and then fling them into clean\r\nWater, to remain there about two hours. In the next place, get ready some\r\nfresh Water in a well-tinn'd Vessel, or glaz'd Vessel, to which put your\r\nMushrooms, and let them boil a little to soften; which being done, take out\r\nyour Mushrooms, and presently put them into cold Water, and let them remain\r\nthere till they are quite cold; after this, free them from the Water, and\r\ndry them well in a linnen Cloth, then put them either into a wide-neck'd\r\nBottle, or glaz'd Earthen-Vessel, disposing here and there among them three\r\nor four Bay-leaves to a Quart, two Nutmegs cut in quarters, about a quarter\r\nof an Ounce of Mace, and boil as much White-Wine and Vinegar, in equal\r\nquantities, as will serve to cover the Mushrooms. This Pickle must be put\r\nto them cold, and the Bottle, or Earthen-Vessel, close stopt and ty'd down\r\nwith a wet Bladder. The reason why the Spice should not be boiled with the\r\nPickle, is, because the Mushrooms would change black by means of the boil'd\r\nSpices; and if this plain Pickle was to be pour'd upon the Mushrooms hot,\r\nit would immediately draw a Colour from the Spices, which would darken the\r\nColour of the Mushrooms: therefore to fill up the glasses in the manner\r\nhere related, is the best way to have your Mushrooms look clean and white.\r\n\r\nThis Month is the proper time to pickle Onions, which make an agreeable\r\nPickle if they are prepared after the following manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo pickle Onions, from Mrs. _A. W._\r\n\r\nWhen your Onions are dry enough to be laid up in the House, take the\r\nsmallest of them, such as are about the bigness of a small Walnut, and of\r\nthat sort which we call the _Spanish_ Onion, for these are not so strong\r\nflavour'd as the _Strasburgh_ Onions; take off only the outward dry Coat,\r\nand boil them in one Water without shifting, till they begin to grow\r\ntender; then take them off the Fire, lay them in a Sieve or Cullendar to\r\ndrain and cool; and as soon as they are quite cold, take off two other\r\nCoats or Skins from each, and rub them gently in a linnen Cloth to dry.\r\nWhen this is done, put them into wide-mouth'd Glasses, with about six or\r\neight fresh Bay-leaves to a Quart, a quarter of an Ounce of Mace, two large\r\nRases of Ginger sliced. All these Ingredients must be interspersed here and\r\nthere in the Glasses among the Onions, and then boil your Vinegar with\r\nabout two Ounces of Bay-Salt to each Quart, taking off the Scum as it\r\nrises, and letting it stand to be cold; pour it into the Glasses, and cover\r\nthem close with wet Bladders, and tie them down; they will eat well, and\r\nlook very white.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of this Month, if the Season has been tolerable, the Grapes\r\nin our _English_ Vineyards will be ripe, and then we must be careful to\r\ngather them in dry Weather, that the Wine may keep the better. I have\r\nalready mention'd, in my other Works, the curious Vineyard near _Bath_, and\r\nthat belonging to Mr. _John Warner_ at _Rotherhith_, where good Wines are\r\nmade every year; and also that at _Darking_ in _Surrey_, belonging to Mr.\r\n_Howard_, which is a very good one: but as some years are less favourable\r\nthan others to the Grape, as well with us as abroad, it will not be\r\nunnecessary to take notice of a few Particulars, which I have observ'd this\r\nyear 1726, concerning the management of Vines, which I have only\r\ncommunicated to a few. I shall also set down a few Directions for the\r\nmaking of Wine, which have not been hitherto mention'd in any of my Works,\r\nor by Mr. _Evelyn_, or Mr. _Mortimer_.\r\n\r\nAs to the first, we are to observe, that the Situation of our Island\r\noccasions our Seasons to be more uncertain than on the Continent, or\r\nbetween the Tropics. The cold and wet Summer, 1725, prevented the ripening\r\nof our later kind of Grapes; and indeed I did not meet anywhere with a\r\nGrape that had its perfect Flavour, unless the Vines were forced; but yet\r\nthere were abundance. However, this Year, 1726, on the contrary, there are\r\nvery few Grapes, and those are likely to be very good, some being already\r\nripe against common Walls, without Art; such as the white Muscadine the\r\n24th of _July_, and black Cluster-Grape. And at Sir _Nicholas Garrard_'s\r\nGarden in _Essex_, I eat some of the black _Frontiniack_ full in\r\nperfection, at the same time; and then the grisly and white _Frontiniack_\r\nGrapes, which are the latest kinds, were transparent, and within a little\r\nof being fit to gather: which is a Novelty so great, that has not been\r\nobserv'd in _England_ in my time; for the _Frontiniack_ Grapes seldom ripen\r\ntill the end of _September_, and then in a bad Year we cannot expect them\r\nwithout Art. However, the Vines in this worthy Gentleman's Garden are of\r\nlong standing, and have been, by his own Directions, order'd and manag'd in\r\na very artful manner for several Years. And tho' this Year generally we\r\nfind so small a quantity in other Gardens, yet at this place there are as\r\nmany as I judge are in the whole County besides. In most other places that\r\nI have observ'd this Year, the common way of management has been rather\r\nregarded than the rational part; and even the best Gardeners have fail'd in\r\ntheir Pruning the last Year, for the production of this Year's Fruit. I\r\nmuch wonder, that after the Demonstrations I have given from Facts, ever\r\nsince the Year 1717, that Vines would grow and prosper well to be planted\r\nin old dry Walls; and the Instances I publish'd in the same Year, in my new\r\nImprovements, of Vines bearing best in dry Rubbish, or the most dry Soil: I\r\nsay, it is surprizing, that some of those to whom I gave that satisfaction,\r\nshould not guard against excess of Wet, especially when every one, who has\r\njudgment in the Affair of Vegetation, must know, that over-abundant\r\nMoisture will destroy the bearing Quality of any Plant, and more especially\r\nof such a kind of Plant as delights in dry mountainous Countries, as the\r\nVine is known to do; but a common method of Management has so possess'd\r\nsome People, that they will not give themselves leave to think that an\r\nAlteration of a Season from a dry to a wet, will occasion an alteration in\r\na Plant. There is one Instance particularly, which I cannot help\r\nmentioning, relating to Vines, and the neccessity of keeping their Roots\r\nfrom Wet, which I observ'd this Year at _Twittenham_, at _John Robarts_'s\r\nEsq. This Gentleman has several Vines laid up against the side of his\r\nHouse, as full of Grapes as I have ever seen any; but at the bottom where\r\nthey grow, the Ground is paved with Bricks for about ten or twelve foot\r\nfrom the Wall they are nail'd to. This Pavement, in the last wet Summer,\r\nkept the Roots from imbibing, or receiving too much Moisture, and therefore\r\nthe Juices of the Vines were digested, and capable of producing Fruit this\r\nYear; whereas such Vines as were not growing in dry places naturally, or\r\nhad their Roots defended from the violent Wet by accident, have few or no\r\nGrapes at all. My Observations this Year, in some places where there are\r\nPavements, still confirms me in my Opinion; and where there was any\r\ntolerable Skill in Pruning, I am persuaded every one will find that there\r\nhave been Grapes this Year, or now are on those Vines that have stood in\r\npaved places, where the Pavement defended the Roots from the wet of the\r\nlast Year. And as I have already mention'd in this, and other Works, the\r\nneccessity of planting Vines in dry places, for regular Seasons; and these\r\nInstances showing us the advantage of doing the same in wet Seasons; I\r\nthink one may reasonably judge, that Pavements made over such places where\r\nVines are planted, as well as Rubbish and dry Ground to plant them in, is\r\nthe best way we can take for them. This way, particularly in a wet Year,\r\nwill keep our Vines from running into long Joints, and the Juices\r\nconsequently in digesting, as we find by experience; for no long-jointed\r\nShoots of Vines are fruitful as they ought to be, and rarely bear any Fruit\r\nat all. 'Tis the short-jointed Shoots that will bear Fruit plentifully; and\r\nwhere there is much Wet at the Root, you must expect very few short Joints,\r\nand also very little Fruit: therefore, in this case, the Roots ought always\r\nto be defended from Wet.\r\n\r\nThis Year, 1726, was, at the beginning, a gentle and moist Spring, but\r\n_April_ and _May_ were hot; which brought every thing so forward, that our\r\nHarvest was about five or six Weeks forwarder than it has been for several\r\nYears past. The Case I have mention'd of the Grapes ripening naturally, was\r\nin proportion to the forwardness of the Harvest; every thing that I have\r\nobserved in the same way was alike. The last Year was as extraordinary in\r\nthe lateness of Crops, for then everything was as backward through the\r\nperpetual Rain we had in the Summer. Sometime or other this Memorandum may\r\nbe of use, if my Papers last so long; however, for the present, consider\r\nhow these two different Years have affected the Vine; the last wet Year\r\nmade the Vines shoot strong and vigorous, and there was no Fruit this Year:\r\nnor was this only with us in _Britain_; but every where in _Europe_. The\r\nlast Year produced such Floods, from the continued Rains at unexpected\r\nSeasons, as was never known in the memory of Man, the Vines shot\r\nvigorously; and this Year there were very few Grapes of the first Crop: but\r\nthis Summer was so good and favourable, by its warm Months at the beginning\r\nof the Summer, that the Vines abroad shot out fresh Crops, or second Crops\r\nor Grapes, which made up for the other deficiency. I expect the next Year\r\nfrom hence, that the Vines will produce a full Crop of Grapes abroad,\r\nbecause this Year has settled the Juices, and digested them; but what\r\nSeason there may be for ripening, is still uncertain, especially when we\r\nhave the two last Years in view. But in our Gardens, I fear, we shall have\r\nworse success; for what this Year has done, will give the Gardeners\r\ngenerally a hard piece of work; for, as I imagine, there was little care\r\ntaken in the beginning of the Year to lay up the Vines, especially because\r\nthere was but a small, or no appearance of Grapes then; and the neglect of\r\nthat Season in managing of Vines, will be the occasion of losing the Crop\r\nthe next Year. What I say here about the management of Vines in the early\r\npart of the Year, I have already treated of in my other Works.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to give some Particulars relating to the making of\r\nWines of Grapes, which I believe may help those who make Wines in our\r\n_English_ Vineyards, and make them stronger and richer than they hare\r\nusually been.\r\n\r\nConsidering the uncertainty of Seasons, and that every sort of Grape will\r\nnot always ripen without Art, it will be necessary to contrive how that\r\nDefect may be amended. The Richness of Wine depends upon the Ripeness of\r\nthe Grapes; and therefore when Grapes have not had the advantage of a\r\nfavourable Season to ripen, the Liquor press'd from the Grapes, may be\r\namended by boiling; for this extraordinary Heat will correct the Juice, by\r\nevaporating the two great quantity of watery parts. This Method, however\r\nripe the Grapes were among the ancient _Greeks_ and _Romans,_ was\r\nfrequently, if not always practised; and is practised in those more\r\nSouthern Climes, why is it not as reasonable in ours? But that this is not\r\nnow practised any where in _Europe,_ is no reason why Wines may not be the\r\nbetter for it. I suppose the only reason why it is not now practised, is,\r\nbecause it would be an Expence and Trouble, more than the Masters of\r\nVineyards have usually been at; and so long as they can sell their Wines at\r\na constant Price, they do not care to go out of the way; but in a bad\r\nSeason there is no doubt but even the Wines in _France_ might be meliorated\r\nby boiling: As in the Instance of the _Frontiniack_ Grapes, that are sour\r\nand unripe, and without Flavour, yet, by boiling or baking, they will gain\r\nthe high Flavour that is found in them when they are well-ripen'd, by the\r\nSun; but in baking or boiling unripe Grapes in the Skins, one must expect\r\nthat the sourness of the Skins will communicate a sourness to the juices\r\nenclosed; but the Juices being press'd and boil'd, will ripen and become\r\npleasant. In my _New Improvements of Planting and Gardening,_ I have given\r\nlarge Directions for making of Wine of Grapes, and in this, have also given\r\nvariety of Receipts for making of Wines of Fruits of our own growth; from\r\nwhence we may learn the Use of boiling Juices of Fruits, and what will\r\nrequire fermenting by Yeast, and what do not. You will find that such Wines\r\nas are boiled with Sugar, are to be fermented with Yeast; and such as have\r\nRaisins for their foundation, will ferment in some measure of themselves.\r\nAnd especially observe, that while any Liquor is fermenting, the Vessel it\r\nis enclosed in must be kept open till it has quite done working; for if we\r\nshould stop it up before that Action is over, it will certainly burst the\r\nVessel; or if it has room enough, will turn sour, and be always thick and\r\ntroubled. Again, all Wines, and other Liquors, must be stopt close as soon\r\nas they have done working, or else the Liquors will grow flat and dead.\r\nSome Wines will ferment six Weeks or two Months after they are in the\r\nVessel, as one may know by the hissing noise which they make; but when that\r\nis done, then the ferment is over, and they should be closed up. But some\r\nWines will ferment much longer than two Months, and then it is a sign that\r\nthey stand too hot; then they must be put in a cooler place, or the outside\r\nof the Vessel frequently cool'd or refresh'd with Water, which will stop\r\nthe ferment. Again, some will not ferment as they ought to do, and then\r\nthey must be set in warmer places, which will raise the ferment.\r\n\r\nIn very bad Years we may help our Wines with a small quantity of Sugar,\r\nperhaps a Pound to a Gallon of Juice, to boil together; but whether we add\r\nSugar or no, we must be sure to take the Scum off the Wines as it rises\r\nwhen they are boiling.\r\n\r\nIn the colder Climates, we ought not to press the Grapes so close as they\r\ndo in the hot Countries, because in the colder parts of the World, and in\r\nplaces the most remote from the Sun, the Skins of the Grapes are much\r\nthicker, and carry a Sourness in them which should not be too much press'd\r\nto mix with the richer part of the Grape; but in the hotter Climes, the\r\nSkins of the Grapes are thin, and the Sourness rectify'd by the Sun, and\r\nwill bear pressing without injuring the finer Juices.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing which I shall mention with regard to the Endeavours that\r\nhave been used to make Wine in the Island of _St. Helena_; a Place so\r\nsituate, that it lies as a resting-place between these Northern Parts, and\r\nthe _East-Indies_, and so remote from other places, that could there be\r\ngood Wine made there, it would be of great help and assistance to the Ships\r\nthat sail that way: But I am informed by a curious Gentleman, who has had\r\nmany good Accounts of that Place, that the Vines which have been planted\r\nthere, are of such sorts, as bring the Grapes ripe and rotten on one side\r\nof the Bunch, and green on the other at the same time, which surely can\r\nnever make good Wine. But upon enquiry, they are only such sorts of Grapes\r\nas grow in close Clusters, and therefore the side next the Sun must be ripe\r\nmuch sooner than the other; for the Climate there is so violent hot, that\r\nthere are no Walls used behind them to reflect the Heat to ripen the Backs\r\nof the Bunches.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I suppose that the best way to have good Wine made in those\r\nParts, is to furnish that Place with Vines which may bring their Grapes in\r\nopen or loose Bunches, such as the Raisin-grape, and some others, which do\r\nnot cluster; for then the Sun would have an equal effect upon all the\r\nGrapes, and good Wine might be made of them: But the worthy Gentleman who\r\ntold me of this, has, I hear, sent to _St. Helena_ a Collection of such\r\nGrapes as will answer the desired end.\r\n\r\nThis is likewise the Month when Saffron appears above ground; sometimes\r\nsooner, sometimes later, according as the Season is earlier or later. This\r\nYear, 1726, I was in the Saffron Country, and in the beginning of _August_\r\nthe Saffron-heads or Roots had shut up so long in the flowering part, that\r\nthe Planters were forced to put them into the Ground: I mean, such as were\r\ndesign'd for new Plantations, which is sooner by near a Month than they\r\nused to sprout, though they lay dry in Heaps, the Weather had so great an\r\neffect upon them.\r\n\r\nAbout _Littlebury_, _Chesterford_, _Linton_, and some other Places\r\nthereabouts, is certainly now the greatest Quantity of Saffron of any part\r\nof the Kingdom; the famous Place noted formerly for it, call'd _Saffron\r\nWalden_, being at this time without it. However, the People of the Places\r\nwhich I have named, do not forbear bringing it to _Walden_ Market, or\r\ndriving Bargains there for large Quantities of it, tho' the Market at\r\n_Linton_ is look'd upon to be much the best. What I have said in my\r\n_Country Gentleman and Farmer's Monthly Director_, gives ample Inductions\r\nfor the Management of Saffron, but I may here add a word or two more\r\nconcerning it; which is, that considering how many Accidents the Saffron is\r\nsubject to, that is dry'd upon the common Kilns, by the scorching of it by\r\ntoo hot a Fire, and the Unskilfulness of the Dryers; I do not wonder that\r\nthere is so much Saffron spoiled. Where there are unskilful Hands employ'd\r\nin the drying part, one ought to provide such Kilns for them as are large\r\nenough to distribute the Heat moderately, and as constant as possible;\r\nwhich may partly be help'd by providing such a Fire as may be constant, and\r\nnot give more Heat at one time than another; for there is a great deal of\r\nJudgment in that. I find, that by the common way, some Saffron is scorch'd,\r\nand some unequally dry'd, for which reason I have contriv'd such a Kiln as\r\nmust necessarily answer the end which is proposed in the drying of Saffron;\r\nthat is, to put it into a state of keeping with its Virtue in it, and to\r\nput it out of the danger of being scorch'd in the drying. This I shall\r\npublish in my _Natural History of_ Cambridgeshire _and_ Essex, which will\r\nsoon appear in the World.\r\n\r\nAs for the way which is now commonly practised in the drying of Saffron, it\r\nis, when you have provided a Kiln, such as I have described in my _Farmer's\r\nMonthly Director_, with a Cloth made of Horse-hair on the top, strain the\r\nHair-cloth tight, and lay on two Sheets of Saffron-paper, that is, a sort\r\nof Paper made on purpose for that Use, which is very large; and prepare a\r\nlittle Vessel with some Small beer, and as many Chives of Saffron as will\r\nmake it of a deep Colour to stand by you; sprinkle over the Paper with a\r\nBrush or Feather dipt in this Liquor, and spread your Saffron upon it,\r\neither in a square or a round Figure, about three Inches thick, and cover\r\nthe Saffron with two Sheets more of the same kind of Paper, and lay a\r\nwoollen Cloth upon them, and over that a Board, which will cover the top of\r\nthe Kiln: view this now and then, till you see that the Steam of the\r\nSaffron comes through the upper Papers. Then take off the Board and\r\nWoollen-cloth, and taking the Papers on each side with your Hands, turn the\r\nSaffron in the Papers, so that the under-side be uppermost; taking off\r\npresently after the Papers which were first the undermost, and then smooth\r\ndown the side of the Saffron that was first next the Fire with a Knife, so\r\nthat it lie all equal. Then cover it as it was at first, and after a little\r\ntime turn the Saffron as you did before, and spread then the upper-side\r\neven with a Knife, as you did at first; then sprinkle your Saffron with the\r\nBrush dipt in the prepared Liquor upon the dry part's of the Cake, and\r\ncover it as before; let it lie then a little, and turn it as occasion\r\nrequires, which may be sooner or later, as the Fire in the Kiln is quick or\r\nslow, minding every time, as you turn it, to sprinkle the dry parts with\r\nthe Liquor; the more it shrinks, the oftner you must turn your Cake of\r\nSaffron, minding still to sprinkle the dry parts; and when it has shrunk\r\nabout three fourths of the first thickness, lay a Stone or Weight upon the\r\nBoard at the top of the Kiln, of about seven or eight Pound weight, the\r\nBoard already being about ten or a dozen Pounds; when it is dry enough,\r\ntake it off the Kiln, and the Paper it was dried in will be of good use;\r\nremember to keep your Fire gentle and clear. We may note, that a Gatherer\r\nof Saffron has this Year about ten Pence _per_ Drain, and that about six\r\nPounds, or six Pounds and a half of raw Saffron will dry to a Pound; but\r\ngenerally they allow only six Pounds of wet Saffron to a Pound of dry\r\nSaffron: but that depends upon the Dryers, who sometimes out of a\r\nWillingness to get Money, do not dry it so much as they ought to do. It is\r\na Rule among the Saffron-Planters in _Cambridgeshire,_ that sixteen\r\nQuarters of Saffron-Roots, or Heads, will plant an Acre; and that a full\r\nAcre this Year produces about seventeen or eighteen Pounds of dry Saffron,\r\ntho' the common rate is about sixteen Pounds.\r\n\r\nAbout this time you have many green Melons upon the Vines which will not\r\nripen; and besides, if they would, that Fruit would now be too cold for the\r\nStomach: therefore it is advisable to pickle them, to make them imitate\r\nMango's, which some prefer before Mango Cucumbers. The following is the\r\nReceipt to pickle them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo pickle green Melons, in imitation of Mango.\r\n\r\nThe Mango is a Fruit brought to us from the _East Indies,_ about the Shape\r\nand Bigness of a small Melon; it has a large Stone in it, and comes to us\r\nin a Pickle, which is strong tasted of Garlick, but approved by most\r\nPeople. When we gather Melons for this use, we must wash them and cut them,\r\nas directed for the Mango Cucumbers, then lay them in Salt and Water,\r\nshifting the Salt and Water every four and twenty Hours, for nine Days\r\nsuccessively; after which, take them out and wipe them dry, and put into\r\nthe inside of each, which has been already scraped, the same Ingredients\r\ndirected for your Mango Cucumbers, and tie them up: then boil your Pickle\r\nof Vinegar, Bay-Salt, and Spices, with these Mangoes in it; scumming it as\r\nit rises, and with it a piece of Allum as directed in the Receipt for Mango\r\nCucumbers, and afterwards follow that Receipt till your Melons are fit to\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nNow we have Wild-Ducks fit for the Table, and it is to be noted, that these\r\nshould not be larded as Land-Fowls, in the roasting of them. It must be\r\nobserved, that they be sent to Table with the Gravey in them; but before\r\nthey are laid down to the Fire, it is practis'd in many places, to chop\r\nOnions, the Leaves of red Sage, and mix these with Pepper and Salt, to be\r\nput in the Belly of the Ducks; and when they are brought to Table, pour a\r\nGlass of Claret warm'd through the Body of the Ducks, which with some\r\nGravey, that must be sent in the Dish, under the Ducks, will make a proper\r\nSauce for them.\r\n\r\nAnother agreeable way of eating Ducks, is roasting them, and eating them\r\nwith boil'd Onions; they are sometimes used in Soups, and baked, and they\r\nlikewise eat very well when they are half roasted, and then cut to pieces\r\nand stew'd with their own Gravey and Claret.\r\n\r\nNow Stubble Geese will be in season, after they have been taken up and fed\r\nfor a Fortnight or thereabouts, in a close place, with Barley and Water;\r\nbut during their Confinement, they must never want Victuals. Note, the\r\nBarley must have no more Water with it than will just cover it, and they\r\nmust never have their Corn dry. If during the time of their feeding, you\r\nhappen to let them out to ramble for a few hours, they will lose more good\r\nFlesh in that time, than they can regain in three Days; therefore when you\r\nhave once put them up, keep them up till they are fit to kill: but if you\r\nwould have them very fat, put them in a Coop for a Week or ten Days before\r\nyou kill them, and feed them with Barley-Meal and Water, made almost as\r\nthick as Paste; and always let there be several of them together, for a\r\nsingle one will pine, and lose Flesh, instead of increasing it by Eating.\r\nAs to the dressing of this Fowl while it is young, in the Spring, under the\r\nCharacter of a Green-Goose, it is fatted in a Coop with Barley-Meal and\r\nWater, and being kill'd and scalded when 'tis fat, 'tis roasted and eaten\r\nwith green Sauce, or scalded Goosberries: but being full grown as at this\r\ntime of the Year, is roasted, being first salted and pepper'd within side,\r\nand salted without side. Some put an Onion, and some Sage-Leaves into the\r\nBody of the Goose, when it is laid down to the Fire, and when it is brought\r\nto Table, it is serv'd with Apples stew'd and mash'd in a Plate by the\r\nSide; but for the Sauce in the Dish, there need be none but some Claret\r\nheated, and pour'd thro' the Body of the Goose, to mix with its own Gravey.\r\nSome also salt Geese, and boil them with Greens, as with other salt Meat; a\r\nGoose may also be bak'd in a Pye to be eaten cold. A Goose is to be kill'd,\r\nby pulling first the Feathers at the back of the Head, and cutting pretty\r\ndeep with a sharp Penknife, between the back of the Head and the Neck,\r\ntaking care that it does not struggle, so as to make the Feathers bloody,\r\nfor that will spoil them: and 'tis to be noted, the Feathers of a full\r\ngrown Goose are worth four Pence to be sold in the Country; this I had from\r\na Gentlewoman in _Surrey._ In _Holland_ they slit Geese down the Back, and\r\nsalt them with Salt-Petre, and other Salt, and then dry them like Bacon;\r\nthey eat very well, if they are boiled tender.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOCTOBER.\r\n\r\nThis Month is a noted Month for brewing of Malt Liquors especially. Brown,\r\nor high-dried Malt is to be used, as I have mentioned at large in the Month\r\nof _March_, under the Article of Brewing; to which I refer my Reader, to be\r\nfully satisfied of such Particulars relating to it, as seem to be the least\r\nconsider'd, altho' they are the most contributing to the Perfection of Malt\r\nLiquors.\r\n\r\nAt this Season, Cyders, Mussels, Cockles, and such kind of Shell-Fish are\r\ngood and in Season; as for the Oyster, it is not only to be eaten raw, but\r\nmakes an agreeable Dish stew'd, or in Scallop-Shells; and besides, being\r\nuseful in many Sauces, are extremely good when they are well pickled.\r\nAltho' the Oyster may seem foreign to a Farm, or some part of the Country,\r\nyet considering that we live in a part of the World surounded with a Sea\r\nthat produces the best Oysters, and that they are a sort of Shell-Fish\r\nwhich we can keep a long time, and feed them, I think it necessary to take\r\nnotice of them. About _Colchester_ the Oyster-Pits are only small Holes\r\nabout twelve foot square, by the side of the River, where the salt Water\r\ncomes up, and has a passage into them at the height of the Tides; in these\r\nplaces the Oysters are laid, and there grow fat, and become green, by a\r\nsort of Weed which is called Crow-Silk: and this may be done any where, if\r\nthere is a River with salt Water, as well as by _Colchester_, and be kept\r\ntwo or three Months; so that I wonder 'tis not practised in other places.\r\nBut if we have not this conveniency, yet if we lay them in Salt and Water\r\nafter the Shells are well wash'd, just when they come from the Sea, they\r\nwill keep a Fortnight in pretty good order, if the Weather be cool, and\r\nthey can have the open Air; but then the Salt and Water should be changed\r\nevery four and twenty hours. The following Receipts are very good for\r\npreparing them for the Table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo stew Oysters. From _Exeter._\r\n\r\nTake large Oysters, open them, and save their Liquor; then when the Liquor\r\nis settled, pour off the Clear, and put it in a Stew-Pan, with some Blades\r\nof Mace, a little grated Nutmeg, and some whole Pepper, to boil gently,\r\ntill it is strong enough of the Spices: then take out the Spices, and put\r\nin the Oysters to stew gently, that they be not hard; and when they are\r\nnear enough, add a piece of Butter, and as much grated Bread as will\r\nthicken the Liquor of the Oysters; and just before you take them from the\r\nFire, stir in a Glass of White-wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoasted Oysters in Scallop Shells. From _Exeter._\r\n\r\nProvide some large scallop Shells, such as are the deepest and hollowest\r\nyou can get, which Shells are sold at the Fishmongers at _London_; then\r\nopen such a Number of Oysters as will near fill the Shells you design, and\r\nsave the Liquor to settle; then pour a moderate quantity of the Liquor into\r\neach Shell, and put a Blade of Mace, and some whole Pepper with it; after\r\nwhich, put into your Shells a small piece of Butter, and cover the whole\r\nwith grated Bread: then let these on a Grid-Iron over the Fire, and when\r\nthey are enough, give the grated Bread at the tops of the Shells a browning\r\nwith a red-hot Iron, and serve them.\r\n\r\nThe same Person who sent the foregoing Receipts, concerning Oysters,\r\nadvises another way of roasting Oysters, which I think is a very good one,\r\nand not much known. It is, to take large Oysters, open them, and hang them\r\nby the finny part on a small Spit, after having first dipt them in the Yolk\r\nof an Egg, and roll'd them in Crumbs of Bread; turn them three or four\r\ntimes before the Fire, and baste them gently with Butter, till the Crumbs\r\nof Bread are crisp upon them, and serve them hot. As for their use in\r\nSauces, they are proper with Fish, and are sometimes used with Fowls; their\r\nown Liquor is always put in such Sauces where they are used. For pickling\r\nof Oysters, the following is an excellent Receipt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo pickle Oysters.\r\n\r\nOpen a quantity of large Oysters, saving their Liquor, and letting it\r\nsettle; then pour the Liquor clear off into a Stew-pan, and wash the\r\nOysters in Water and Salt: after which, boil them gently in their own\r\nLiquor, so that they are not too hard. When they are enough, take them out,\r\nand add to the Liquor some Mace, a few Cloves, some whole Pepper, a little\r\nGinger, and a Bay-Leaf or two, and let the Liquor boil, putting to it about\r\na fourth part of White-wine Vinegar, letting it continue to boil a little\r\nmore; then take it off, and let it stand to be quite cold. When the Oysters\r\nare cold, put them into Jars or Gally-pots, and pour the Liquor with the\r\nSpice cold upon them; then tie them down with Leather.\r\n\r\nThe Mussel and Cockle may be pickled after the same manner, only allowing\r\nthis difference; _i.e._ that Cockles and Mussels are taken out of their\r\nShells by setting them over the Fire, and opening them by the Heat; but\r\nbefore-hand the Shells must be wash'd very clean, and then must be put in\r\nthe Sauce-pan without Water, they of themselves will soon produce Liquor\r\nenough: then as the Shells open, take out the Fish, and wash every one well\r\nin Salt and Water; but as for the Mussels, they must every one be carefully\r\nlook'd into, and discharg'd from that part which is call'd the Beard, and\r\nalso particular care must be taken to examine whether there are any Crabs\r\nin them, for they are very poisonous, and as they lie in the Mouth of the\r\nMussel, may easily be discover'd; they are commonly as large as a Pea, and\r\nof the shape of a Sea-Crab, but are properly Sea-Spiders: the Mussels\r\nhowever where you find them, are not unwholesome, and it is only the eating\r\nof this little Animal, which has been the occasion of People's swelling\r\nafter they had eaten Mussels, but the goodness of the Fish is well enough\r\nworth the Care of looking after that. When your Mussels or Cockles are all\r\nclean pick'd and wash'd, lay them to cool; and when their Liquor is well\r\nfettled, pour off the Clear, and boil it up with the same sort of Spices\r\nmentioned above for the pickled Oysters, with the same proportion of\r\nVinegar; and letting it stand till it is quite cold, put your Fish into\r\nproper Pots, or little Barrels, and pour the Liquor upon them till they are\r\ncover'd with it, and stop them up close: they will keep good two or three\r\nMonths, if the Liquor is now and then boiled up, but it must be always cold\r\nbefore it be put upon the Fish.\r\n\r\nIn the Management of Cockles for pickling, or for eating any other way, let\r\nthe Shells be very well wash'd, and then lay the Cockles in a Pan of Salt\r\nand Water for two or three days, to scour themselves from the Sand that is\r\nin them at their first taking; but observe to shift the Salt and Water\r\nevery day. The largest Cockles that I have observ'd on the _English_ Coasts\r\nare those found about _Torbay,_ which are sometimes brought to _Exeter_\r\nMarket; the Fish is as large as a good Oyster, and the Shells of some are\r\nabove two Inches and a half Diameter. Mussels and Cockles may likewise be\r\nstew'd and grill'd in Scallop Shells, as directed for Oysters. The Mussels\r\nafter they are well pick'd are flower'd and fryed in some places, and eaten\r\nwith Butter and Mustard, and the _French_ make rich Soups of them.\r\n\r\nAs this is a Season when we have plenty of Quinces, I shall insert the\r\nfollowing Receipt for making Wine of them, which is very pleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Quince Wine. From Mrs. _E. B._\r\n\r\nGather your Quinces when they are dry, and wipe them very clean with a\r\ncoarse Cloth, then grate them with a coarse Grater or a Rasp, as near the\r\nCore as you can; but grate in none of the Core, nor the hard part about it:\r\nthen strain your grated Quinces into an earthen Pot, and to each Gallon of\r\nLiquor put two Pounds of fine Loaf-Sugar, and stir it till your Sugar is\r\ndissolved; then cover it close, and let it stand twenty four hours, by\r\nwhich time it will be fit enough to bottle, taking care in the bottling of\r\nit that none of the Settlement go into the Bottles. This will keep good\r\nabout a Year; observe that your Quinces must be very ripe when you gather\r\nthem for this use.\r\n\r\nRabbits still continue in Season this Month, and besides the common way of\r\ndressing them, they may be larded, and drest in the following manner; which\r\nI had from a Gentleman in _Suffolk._ Make a Farce for them, like that\r\nmentioned for the Belly of a Hare in the preceding Month, and order its\r\nManagement and Sauce as for a Hare. A young Rabbit, or Hare, is known by\r\nthe tenderness of the Jaw-Bones, which will easily break by pressing with\r\nthe Finger and Thumb.\r\n\r\nWoodcocks are now in Season, and it is to be advertised of them, that they\r\nare to be only pull'd of their Feathers, and not drawn like other Fowls,\r\nbut the Guts left in them; when they are roasted, they must be serv'd upon\r\nToasts of Bread, upon which the Guts are spread and eaten, when they are\r\nbrought to Table. The inward of this Bird eats like Marrow; this is\r\ngenerally eaten with Juice of Orange, a little Salt and Pepper, without\r\nother Sauce. The Legs of this Bird are esteem'd the most, and are therefore\r\npresented to the greatest Strangers at Table; but the Wings and Breast of a\r\nPartridge are the principal parts of that Fowl, for the Legs are full of\r\nStrings, like the Legs of Turkeys and Pheasants.\r\n\r\nThe Snipe is of the same nature with the Woodcock, and is ordered in every\r\nrespect like it. These may be larded with Bacon upon the Breast, or else\r\nstrew'd with Salt and Crumbs of Bread, while they are roasting. Besides the\r\nSauce used for Woodcocks and Snipes, the aforesaid _Suffolk_ Gentleman has\r\nthe following which is Gravey with a little minced Anchovy, a Rocambole,\r\nsome Lemon-Juice, and a little White-wine boiled together; and when it is\r\nstrain'd, pour it in a Saucer, and serve it with the Fowls.\r\n\r\nThese Birds are in plenty among the woody parts of _England,_ from\r\n_September_ till the end of _March,_ and then they all leave us at one\r\ntime, except only such as have been lamed by the Sportsmen, and disabled\r\nfor Flight; and then they will breed in _England,_ as there are Instances\r\nenough. About _Tunbridge,_ it is frequent to find them in Summer; and I\r\nhave known the same in _Leicestershire._ I think if one could take\r\nWoodcocks here in Hay-Nets, as they do in _France,_ and pinion them or\r\ndisable a Wing, and then turn them loose again, we might raise a Breed of\r\nthem that would stay with us; but I have experienced that they will not\r\nfeed if they are confined in Cages or Aviaries, for they must have liberty\r\nto run in search of their Food, which they find for the most part in moist\r\nplaces, near Springs; for I have often taken both the Woodcock and the\r\nSnipe with such Snares as are made for Larks, by laying them in the Night\r\non the Bank of Rivulets, or watery Trenches near Woods.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER.\r\n\r\nPheasants are still in season, and are now chiefly roasted, for they are\r\nnot so frequently boiled, till about _April,_ and then only the Hens when\r\nthey are full of Eggs; but that, I think, is too destroying a way. The\r\nboiled Pheasants are generally dressed with Oyster-Sauce, or Egg-Sauce, but\r\nthe roasted are either larded on the Breast with fine Bacon Fat, or else\r\nroasted and strew'd with Crumbs of Bread: these, says the _Suffolk_\r\nGentleman, who sent me the foregoing Method of ordering the Woodcock and\r\nSnipe, should be served with the same Sauces that are used for Partridges.\r\nThe Sauces in his Directions are within a trifle the same as those I have\r\nalready set down in _September_ for Partridges or Quails, so that I shall\r\nnot repeat them here.\r\n\r\nThe Truffle, which I have treated of at large as to its manner of Growth\r\nand Season of Maturity, in my _Gentleman and Farmer's Monthly Director,_\r\naffords such Variety of agreeable Dishes, that I have taken care to send to\r\na curious Gentleman abroad for the Receipt how to dress it: They are very\r\nplenty in our Woods in _England,_ as I understand by several who have found\r\nthem this Summer by my Directions, and I believe will be much more so,\r\nsince several curious Gentlemen have followed my Advice in propagating\r\nthem. It is now, as well as in the two preceding Months, that we may find\r\nthem of a fine Flavour; but they being something more in perfection in this\r\nMonth than in the others, I think it the properest to give the Methods of\r\nordering them for the Table in this place: The first manner is to broil\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo broil Truffles.\r\n\r\nThe Truffle being brought in fresh, wash it well, and cut off the rough\r\nCoat on the outside: some of these will be as large as one's Fist, and they\r\nare the best for this purpose; but let them be of any size, as soon as the\r\nCoat is off, cut them through a little more than half-way, and put Pepper\r\nand Salt into the opening, and close it again; then wrap up each Truffle in\r\nwet Paper close, and broil them over a gentle Fire of Wood-Embers till you\r\njudge they are enough, which will be as soon as they are very hot quite\r\nthrough; let them be turn'd as occasion requires, that they may be all\r\nequally done, and then serve them to the Table in a folded Napkin. This is\r\na very good way of eating them, but the other I have more frequently eaten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Stew Truffles in Wine.\r\n\r\nThe Truffles must be peel'd from the rough Coat on the outside, and\r\nwell-wash'd; then cut your Truffles into Slices, and stew them in White\r\nwine, or Claret, which you please, with Salt, Pepper, and a Bay-leaf; or in\r\nthe lieu of that, some _Jamaica_ Pepper, and serve them. White-wine for\r\nthis use is generally preferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Stew Truffles after another manner.\r\n\r\nGather Truffles, peel them and wash them, and then cut them in Slices,\r\nafter which fry them a little in a Stew-pan, with either Butter or\r\nHog's-Lard, and a little Wheat-Flower; then take them out and drain them,\r\nand put them again in a Stew-pan with Gravey, a bunch of Sweet-Herbs, some\r\nSalt, Pepper, and Nutmeg grated; and when they have stewed a little in\r\nthis, strain the Liquor, and dish them for the Table, garnished with Slices\r\nof Lemmon. Besides this way, they may be used in the same manner as Fowls\r\nare stewed or fricasseed, with brown or white Sauces, after they have been\r\nsoften'd a little by boiling.\r\n\r\nWhile I am speaking of the Truffle, I may well enough mention the Receipts\r\nfor the management of the Morille. Altho' the Morille grows in _April_,\r\nwhich is the only time when it may be gather'd fresh, yet one may dress the\r\ndry'd ones now, by first softening them in warm Water and Salt for three or\r\nfour Minutes; but, as observ'd before, they are best fresh gather'd. And\r\nagain, I chuse to put the Receipts for their Management in this place,\r\nbecause they are so near a-kin to the Truffle. In the first place, I shall\r\nspeak of drying them, which I have done in _England,_ after the following\r\nmanner: Gather, and wash them, and when they are well drain'd, then lay\r\nthem in a Dish, and dry them by degrees in a gentle Oven; and when they are\r\nthroughly dry, keep them in a dry place, and in a cover'd earthen glazed\r\nPot; but when they are fresh, order them according to the following\r\nReceipts. And I am the more ready to give these to the Publick, because all\r\nsuch who know the nicest way of eating, may nor be disappointed in their\r\nTravels thro' _England,_ and denied at the Inns such things as perhaps are\r\nas agreeable in that way, as any in the Country. Particularly I remember at\r\n_Newberry,_ or _Spinhamland,_ in the publick Road to _Bath,_ I was at the\r\nmost publick and noted Inn in that Road, and had got some very good\r\nMushrooms, and the People there were of opinion that they were poisonous,\r\nor else did not know how to dress them, and by no means they would send\r\nthem to the Table. I say, if such mistakes can be made in a place where so\r\nmany People of fashion travel continually, it is not likely that Morilles\r\nor Truffles will be received with more favour than my Mushrooms; and I\r\nbelieve that some of the greatest Niceties of our Country may ever remain\r\nunknown, without a Work of this nature, which I have pick'd up inch by\r\ninch, _viz._ in my Travels. And besides, considering the strange\r\ndisagreeable Compositions which one meets with in some of our Travels, as\r\nSugar with a pickled Trout, and many more as ridiculous; I think this\r\nlittle Piece of Work not unworthy my Time. Again, there are many Families\r\nin _England_ which have plenty about them, and do not know what to do with\r\nit; and therefore I think this the more necessary. But to come to my point,\r\nthe Morille may be dress'd when it is either fresh or blanch'd in warm\r\nWater, according to the following Receipts, which I had from _France._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make a Ragout of Morilles.\r\n\r\nThe Morilles being fresh gather'd, take off the Roots, and wash them in\r\nmany Waters, for the Wrinkles in their Tops harbour a great deal of Dirt\r\nand Sand; then slit them lengthways, and fry them a little in a Stew-pan,\r\nwith Butter or Hogs-Lard, letting either be very hot when you put in the\r\nMorilles; then let them drain, and put them in a fresh Stew-pan with\r\nGravey, in which shred some Parsley and Cherville very small, with a young\r\nOnion, some Salt, and a little Nutmeg: let these stew gently, and send them\r\nto the Table garnish'd with slices of Lemmon, or they may be sent to the\r\nTable in Cream, as we have already mentioned concerning other things in the\r\nsame manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo fry the Morilles.\r\n\r\nPrepare your Morilles as directed in the former Receipt, and boil them in a\r\nlittle Gravey gently; when they begin to be tender, take them out of the\r\nLiquor, and flower them very well, then fry them in Hog's-Lard: when they\r\nare thus prepared, make a Sauce for them of the Liquor or Gravey the\r\nMorilles were stew'd in, season'd with Salt, Nutmeg and a little Juice of\r\nLemmon.\r\n\r\nThe following Directions I had from a Gentleman in _Suffolk._ The Turkey is\r\nnow in good Season, and may be either boiled or roasted; when it is boiled,\r\nit is most commonly served with Oyster-Sauce, and when it is designed for\r\nroasting, it may be larded with fine Fat of Bacon on the Breast, or else\r\nwell strew'd with Crumbs of Bread, having first made a Farce to fill the\r\nHollow of the Neck, where the Crop lay; this Farce may be made of grated\r\nBread, Spice, Salt, butter'd Eggs, and some sweet Herbs powder'd, the whole\r\nwell mix'd and bound with the Yolk of a raw Egg; or the Liver of a Fowl may\r\nbe boiled and chop'd small and put into it. The Receipt as I receiv'd it\r\ndirects Beef-Suet chop'd small instead of butter'd Eggs; but Mr. _John\r\nHughs,_ a noted Cook in _London,_ tells me that Suet should be avoided in\r\nthese Farces, because it is apt to cool too soon, and offend the Roof of\r\nthe Mouth, and therefore directs butter'd Eggs in their stead. As for the\r\nSauce for the roasted Turkey, it must be made with Gravey, a Bunch of sweet\r\nHerbs, some Lemmon-peel, a Shallot or two, and some whole Pepper and\r\nAll-spice boiled together and strained.\r\n\r\nConcerning the Lark, which is now in Season, the abovemention'd Gentleman\r\ngives the following Directions: Let the Larks be pick'd only and not\r\ngutted, truss the Legs, with a Leaf of red Sage to every Lark between the\r\nJoints of the Legs; then with a Feather, dip'd in the Yolk of an Egg\r\nbeaten, wash the Body of every Lark, and cover it well with Crumbs of\r\nBread; after which, cut some thin Slices of fat Bacon, about three Inches\r\nlong, and an Inch broad, and lay the Larks in a row, side to side, with a\r\npiece of this Bacon between every two Larks; then have small Spits about\r\nten Inches long, and pass the Spits thro' the Sides of the Larks and the\r\nBacon, so that you have half a dozen Larks upon each Spit, observing to\r\nhave a piece of Bacon on both the outsides of the half dozen Larks; baste\r\nthese well while they are roasting, and for the Sauce for them, fry some\r\ngrated Bread crisp in Butter, and set them to drain before the Fire, that\r\nthey may harden; serve these under the Larks when you send them to Table,\r\nand garnish with Slices of Lemmon. Some have their Lark-Spits made of\r\nSilver, and serve their Larks upon the Spits to the Table, by which means\r\nthey keep hot the longer: you may eat them with Juice of Lemmon with the\r\nfry'd Crumbs, but some like such Gravey-Sauce with them as is directed for\r\nthe roasted Turkey. Tho' the Guts are left in the Larks, yet they are not\r\nto be eaten.\r\n\r\nIn my Travels I observed a kind of Soup, which was very frequently used\r\nabroad, and quickly ready, that was very taking to most Travellers who\r\ndelighted in savoury Dishes, which the People abroad call Soup _a\r\nl'Yvrogne_. It is made as follows.\r\n\r\nTake half a score Onions, peel them, and cut them in small Pieces into a\r\nStewpan, and fry them brown with Butter, and a little Pepper and Salt; and\r\nwhen they are enough, pour such a quantity of Water upon them as you think\r\nproper to make a Soup of them; then let these boil together, and thicken it\r\nwith as many Eggs as are neccessary, keeping it stirring to prevent the\r\nEggs from Curdling. Some add to this a large Glass of White-wine, which I\r\nthink makes it better tasted than 'tis without it: this is served with a\r\n_French_ Role in the middle. At the same time I met with the following\r\nReceipt for Beef _A-la-mode,_ which is as good as any I have eaten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Beef _A-la-mode._\r\n\r\nTake a fleshy piece of Beef, without Fat, and beat it well with a Rolling\r\npin, then lard it with pretty large pieces of Bacon-Fat, and if you please\r\nput over the Fire a little to fry till the outside is brown, and then put\r\nit to stew in a deep Stew-pan, or glaz'd Earthen-Vessel, with Salt, Pepper,\r\nBay-Leaves or _Jamaica_ Pepper, some Lemmon-Peel, half a dozen large\r\nMushrooms, two Gloves of Garlick, or four or five Cloves of Shallot, half a\r\nPint of Wine, and a Pint of Water; cover it close, and let it stew gently\r\ntill it is tender: when it is enough, fry some Flower in Hogs-Lard, and add\r\nto it, with some Lemmon-Juice, or a little Verjuice. This is very good hot,\r\nbut is for the most part eaten cold, cut in Slices of about half an Inch\r\nthick.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDECEMBER.\r\n\r\nNow is the principal Season for killing of Hogs, as well for Pork as for\r\nBacon, and likewise for Brawn. I have already in my other Works given\r\nDirections for making of pickled Pork and Bacon; so that I shall say little\r\nof it in this place, but give the Receipts for ordering some particular\r\nparts of Hogs. The following Receipt I received from _France,_ concerning\r\nthe preparing of the Jole of a wild Boar, and have had it try'd in\r\n_England_ with the Head of a common Hog; and I find little difference,\r\nespecially if the Hog has been fed with Acorns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo dress a Hog's Head, in imitation of the Jole of a wild Boar.\r\n\r\nTake a Hog's Head and burn it well all over upon a clear Fire, till all the\r\nHair is burnt to the Skin; then take a piece of Brick, and rub the Head all\r\nover as hard as possible, to grind off the Stumps of the Bristles, and\r\nfinish the whole with your Knife, and then clean the Head very well; when\r\nthis is done, you must take out all the Bones, opening the Head in the\r\nunder Part, and beginning with the under Jaw-Bones and the Muzzle; then\r\ncleave the Head, leaving only the Skin over the Skull to hold it together:\r\ntake out the Tongue and the Brains. When thus you have taken away all the\r\nBones, stab the Flesh with the Point of your Knife in many places on the\r\ninside, without wounding the Skin, and put Salt into every Incision, then\r\njoin the Head together, and tie it well together with Packthread, and then\r\nwrapping it up in a Napkin, put it in a Kettle, with a large Quantity of\r\nWater, a large Bunch of all kinds of sweet Herbs, a little Coriander and\r\nAnise-Seeds, two or three Bay Leaves, some Cloves, and two or three Nutmegs\r\ncut in pieces, and some Salt, if you think there is any wanting; add\r\nlikewise two or three large Onions and a Sprig or two of Rosemary. When\r\nthis has boiled half enough, pour in a Bottle of Wine, and let it boil\r\nthree or four Hours longer till 'tis tender; for it will not be so under\r\nseven or eight Hours boiling, if the Hog be large; and if it is a Boar's\r\nHead, that has been put up for Brawn, it will take more time to boil. Being\r\nboiled enough, let it cool in the Liquor, and then take it out and untie\r\nit, and lay it in a Dish to be carry'd cold to the Table, either whole or\r\nin Slices. If you will, you may salt it three or four days before you boil\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Sausages, from Lady _M._\r\n\r\nTake the Flesh of a Leg of Pork, and mince it small, and to every Pound of\r\nthe Flesh minced, mince about a quarter of a Pound of the hard Fat of the\r\nHog; then beat some _Jamaica_ Pepper very fine, and mix with it some Pepper\r\nand Salt, with a little Sweet-Marjoram powder'd, and some Leaves of red\r\nSage minced very small; mix all these very well, and if you fill them into\r\nGuts, either of Hogs or Sheep, beat two or three Yolks of Eggs and mix with\r\nthem, taking care not to fill the Guts too full, lest they burst when you\r\nbroil or fry them: but if you design them to be eaten without putting them\r\nin Guts, then put no Eggs to them, but beat the Flesh and the Fat in a\r\nStone Mortar, and work the Spice and Herbs well into it with your hands, so\r\nthat it be well mix'd, and keep it in a Mass to use at your pleasure,\r\nbreaking off Pieces, and rolling them in your hands, and then flowering\r\nthem well before you fry them. If you use them in Guts, take special care\r\nthat the Guts are well clean'd, and lie some time in a little warm\r\nWhite-wine and Spice before you use them; if any Herb happens to be\r\ndisagreeable in this Mixture, it may be left out, or others added at\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nThe following Receipt to make Sausages of Fish for Fast-Days, I had at\r\n_Bruxelles_, which I have experienced to be very good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Sausages of Fish.\r\n\r\nTake the Flesh of Eels, or of Tench, and to either of these put some of the\r\nFlesh of fresh Cod, or of Pike or Jack, chop these well together with\r\nParsley, and a few small Onions; season these with a little Salt, Pepper,\r\nCloves in Powder, a little grated Nutmeg, and, if you will, a little\r\npowder'd Ginger, with some Thyme, Sweet-Marjoram, a little Bay-Leaf, all\r\ndry'd and powder'd; and mix all these well together with a little Butter.\r\n\r\nThen beat the Bones of the Fish in a Mortar, pouring in among them while\r\nthey are beating, a Glass or two of Claret, which must afterwards be poured\r\nupon the above Mixture; then take the Guts of a Calf well wash'd and\r\nclear'd of the Fat, for in that condition I find there is no scruple to use\r\nthem abroad: being well discharged of the Fat, fill these Skins with your\r\nMixture of Fish, _&c._ tying them at both ends, and lay them for twenty\r\nfour Hours in a Pickle of Wine and Salt, and taking them out from thence,\r\nhang them in a Chimney where they may be well smoak'd with a Wood-Fire, or\r\nburning Saw-dust for twenty-four hours, or longer if you please, provided\r\nyou have allow'd Salt and Spices enough. When you would use them, boil them\r\ngently in White-wine, with a Bunch of Sweet Herbs; or in Water, with one\r\nthird part White-wine, and Sweet-Herbs. These are served cold at the Table,\r\nand eat very well.\r\n\r\nThe Boars that were put up for Brawn, are now fit to kill. It is to be\r\nobserv'd, that what is used for Brawn, is the Flitches only, without the\r\nLegs, and they must have the Bones taken out, and then sprinkled with Salt,\r\nand lay'd in a Tray, or some other thing, to drain off the Blood; when this\r\nis done, salt it a little, and roll it up as hard as possible, so that the\r\nlength of the Collar of Brawn be as much as one side of the Boar will bear,\r\nand to be, when it is rolled up, about nine or ten Inches diameter. When\r\nyou have rolled up your Collar as close as you can, tye it with Linnen\r\nTape, as tight as possible, and then prepare a Cauldron with a large\r\nQuantity of Water to boil it: In this boil your Brawn till it is tender\r\nenough for a Straw to pass into it, and then let it cool; and when it is\r\nquite cold, put it in the following Pickle. Put to every Gallon of Water a\r\nhandful or two of Salt, and as much Wheat-Bran; boil them well together,\r\nand then strain the Liquor as clear as you can from the Brawn, and let it\r\nstand till it is quite cold, at which time put your Brawn in it; but this\r\nPickle must be renewed every three Weeks. Some put half small Beer and half\r\nWater; but then the small Beer should be brewed with pale Malt: but I think\r\nthe first Pickle is the best. _Note,_ The same Boar's Head being well\r\ncleaned, may be boiled and pickled like the Brawn, and is as much esteem'd.\r\n\r\nThis is a good Season to make what they call Hung-Beef: The way of doing\r\nit, is, to take the thin Pieces of the Beef, and salting them with\r\nSalt-Petre about two Ounces to a Pound of common Salt, and rubbing it well\r\ninto the Meat, dry it in a Chimney with Wood Smoke. When this is throughly\r\ncured, it will be red quite through, which one may try by cutting; for if\r\nthere is any of the Flesh green, it is not smoked enough. It is, in my\r\nopinion, better than any Bacon to be boiled and eaten hot.\r\n\r\nThis is what I shall say, concerning the use of such things as are\r\ngenerally found about a Gentleman's Country-Seat, or about a Farm, which I\r\nthink will be very useful, tho' a little out of the common Road; and so I\r\nshall make no Apology for publishing such Receipts as I am sure are good.\r\nIf I do not use proper Terms in some of my Receipts in Cookery, I have at\r\nleast put my Receipts into such a Method, as I suppose will make them\r\nintelligible, and what any one may understand: But I must take notice\r\nbefore I conclude, that the meaning of publishing this, is to instruct\r\nthose who may not have had opportunity of observing or collecting so much\r\nas I have done, and not any way pretending to inform those who are full\r\nenough of Knowledge already. However, I hope my Readers will be contented\r\nwith what I have here given them, and meet with something that is New and\r\nUseful.\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\nCOUNTRY HOUSEWIFE\r\nAND\r\nLADY's DIRECTOR,\r\nIN THE\r\nMANAGEMENT OF A HOUSE, AND THE\r\nDELIGHTS AND PROFITS OF A FARM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCLUDING\r\n\r\nA great Variety of the most curious Receipts for Dressing all the Sorts of\r\nFlesh, Fish, Fowl, Fruit and Herbs, which are the Productions of a Farm, or\r\nfrom any Foreign Parts.\r\n\r\nContained in Letters, and taken from the Performances of the most polite\r\nProficients in most Parts of _Europe_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow publish'd for the Good of the Publick, By R.

BRADLEY\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is nothing induces me so much, to publish this Second Part of\r\nDirections to prepare the Things about a Farm or Family, as the\r\nEncouragement my first Volume, in this Way, has met with in the World;\r\nwhich being now in the sixth Edition, has brought me many Receipts, from\r\nthe Curious, which would be detrimental to the Publick if I did not offer\r\nthem to the World. I must acknowledge my Gratitude, in this Piece, to\r\nseveral Persons of Distinction, and good Oeconomy, who have favoured me\r\nwith their Assistance; and, as far as their Leave would suffer me, I have\r\ngiven their Names or Signatures. Most of the Receipts I have been Witness\r\nto, at some Meal or other with them, or else in Publick Places have\r\npurchas'd; for I always thought that there was more satisfaction in eating\r\nclean and well, if one had good Provisions in a Place, than to have such\r\nProvisions good, and spoiled in their Management.\r\n\r\nWith the many Noblemen I am conversant with, and in the large Tract of\r\nGround I have passed over, it may not be surprizing, that I have collected\r\nso great a variety of Things in this way; and there is no greater Happiness\r\nI enjoy, than to communicate to the World, what I love myself: but as the\r\nProverb says, _there is no disputing about Tastes_, so that every one has\r\nstill the Liberty of choosing or rectifying any thing as their Palate\r\ndirects, when they have a good Foundation to go upon.\r\n\r\nI think, if these Receipts had lain still in my Cabinet, they might after\r\nmy death have been distributed to the World in a wrong Sense; but as I have\r\nparticularly been present amongst many of them, I have taken the meaning of\r\nthem in Writing; or if I had left them behind me, they might have been\r\nlost, which, I think, are much too good to be bury'd in Oblivion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Country Lady's DIRECTOR.\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince I have publish'd the Receipts I gathered together, with regard to the\r\nseveral Preparations of the Products of a Farm, for the Table; entitled,\r\n_The Lady's Monthly Director_, _&c._ (now in its sixth Edition:) I have\r\nreceived a great number of Letters relating to many Improvements that may\r\nbe made to it, and am desired to publish them, in order to render my first\r\nVolume more compleat. And, as I find they will be of public Use, I shall\r\nbegin with one concerning the Preservation of Flesh, Fowls and Fish from\r\nPutrefaction, or Stinking; which is too often the Case, in Summer-time,\r\nwhen it is rare to find any sweet Morsels, although they have undergone the\r\nDiscipline of Salting. As for the common Notion, that Women cannot lay Meat\r\nin Salt, equally with success, at all Times, it is false; it is the Manner\r\nof doing it, and not the state of the Women who handle it, that makes it\r\nright; there must be a right way of Management to preserve it, and render\r\nit fit for the Palate, as the following Letter informs us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mr. _Bradley._\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have not only read your Book call'd, _The Lady's Monthly Director_, but\r\nhave tasted many elegant Dishes of Meat, ordered by the Receipts in it; but\r\nI think, as you are a philosophical Gentleman, you should have taken a\r\nlittle more Notice of the preservation of Flesh from Putrefaction: For in\r\nmany places I have set down to a Dinner which has sent me out of the Room\r\nby the very smell of it; even, though I am so much of the _French_ Taste,\r\nthat I can bear the _Fumette_. The Husband, in this Case, has blamed his\r\nWife; and the Wife has taken the opportunity of whispering to her Husband,\r\nthat the Maid was not in right Sorts when she salted the Meat: but I am\r\nsure, I shall set you to rights in that Point.\r\n\r\nI have taken pains in my Family, which consists of thirty Persons, to have\r\nmy Wife order the Experiment to be made, and I am satisfied from her\r\nArguments, that there is nothing in the Notion above. But now to the\r\npurpose. Let your Flesh-Meat be fresh, and take all the bleeding Arteries\r\nfrom it; then sprinkle it with common Salt, and let it lie in the Air for\r\ntwelve Hours; but salt the Places, where the Arteries were, more\r\nparticularly: then wipe your Meat dry, and make some Salt very hot, over\r\nthe Fire, then rub in the Salt very well, and lay the Pieces of salted Meat\r\none upon another, and it will keep for several Months.\r\n\r\nOr with common Salt, rub the several Pieces of Meat briskly with it, after\r\nthe Blood is out, and especially in the hollow Places lay Salt enough. So\r\nwill you be sure to have your Meat sweet, either Beef or Pork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo send _Venison_ Sweet in hot Weather.\r\n\r\nGive it a little Salt, and have the Haunches parted, taking out the Marrow\r\nand all the Veins, as they are called, that bleed; and then wipe all of it\r\nquite dry after you have wash'd it with Vinegar, and then powder it with\r\nPepper, and in an open Basket send it up to _London._\r\n\r\nSometimes Venison (meaning a Buck) comes up to _London,_ not fit for the\r\nTable; to prevent which, order the Keeper, when he has killed it, to strew\r\nthree or four Pounds of Pepper, beaten fine, upon it; and especially upon\r\nthe Neck Parts of the Sides, after he has wash'd them with Vinegar and\r\ndried them well.\r\n\r\nBut if it stinks, when you receive it, wash it with Vinegar, and dry it,\r\nthen pepper it and wrap it in a dry Cloth, bury it in the Ground, three\r\nfoot deep at least, and in sixteen Hours it will be sweet, fit for eating;\r\nthen wash off the Pepper with Vinegar, and dry it with a Cloth, and hang it\r\nwhere the cool Air may pass, and the blue Flies cannot come at it. _Query._\r\nIs it not strange, that we see daily the Limbs of Horses hung up in Trees,\r\nand they do not stink, but remain good a long while fit for Dogs Meat? If\r\nany one will say, that Dogs all delight to eat Carrion, I must deny that;\r\nbut that every sort of Dog will roll himself in Carrion, when he can find\r\nit, is certain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo send _Partridges_ a long way in hot Weather.\r\n\r\nWhen you have killed your Partridges, take out the Crop, and the Artery\r\nwhich bleeds in the Neck, then fill the Place with Pepper; and the Mouths\r\nof the Fowls should be fill'd with the same, for these Parts take a taint\r\nsooner than the rest; the Vent too, ought to be taken care of, and open'd,\r\nand filled with Pepper, beaten grossly. _N.B._ This Pepper may be always\r\nwash'd away without leaving any Season or Flavour behind it, and is a\r\ncertain Antidote against Corruption. So the same may be done with\r\nPheasants, and you should likewise leave on their Feathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo keep an _Hare_ a long Time.\r\n\r\nAs soon as 'tis kill'd and discharged of its Entrails, take care that all\r\nthe Blood be dried away with Cloths about the Liver, for there it is apt to\r\nsettle, then dust the Liver well with Pepper; and fill the Body with\r\nNettles, or dry Moss, for these will not raise a ferment as Hay and Straw\r\nwill do, when they come to be wet; then fill the Mouth with Pepper, and it\r\nwill keep a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo keep _Wild-Ducks_ fresh.\r\n\r\nDraw them, and fill the Body with red Sage, after the inside is well\r\npepper'd; and likewise pepper the inside of the Mouth, leave on the\r\nFeathers. A Goose may be serv'd the same way.\r\n\r\nBut if they be too long kept, or through want of Care, they should receive\r\na taint; then, when they are pull'd, wash the Inside very well, with\r\nVinegar and Water, and dry it well with a Cloth; and scrape away, if need\r\nbe, what are call'd the Kidneys; then strew the Inside afresh with Pepper,\r\nand hang them up for an Hour or two, where the Air may pass through them.\r\n\r\nSome in such a case will put an Onion into the Body, which does very well\r\ntowards restoring it to a freshness; then wash out all, and prepare it for\r\nthe Spit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHelps towards the Preservation of _Fish._\r\n\r\nIf you would keep Fish long, kill them as soon as they are out of the\r\nWater, and take out their Gills; then fill their Heads as much as may be,\r\nwith Pepper, and wipe them very dry, and pack them in dry Wheat-Straw.\r\n\r\n_T. R._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Wine_ of _White Elder-berries,_ like _Cyprus_ Wine from Mrs.\r\n_Warburton_ of _Cheshire._\r\n\r\nTo nine Gallons of Water, put nine Quarts of the Juice of White Elder\r\nberries, which has been pressed gently from the Berries, with the Hand, and\r\npassed thro' a Sieve, without bruising the Kernels of the Berries; add to\r\nevery Gallon of Liquor three Pounds of _Lisbon_ Sugar, and to the whole\r\nQuantity put an Ounce and a half of Ginger, sliced, and three quarters of\r\nan Ounce of Cloves; then boil this near an Hour, taking off the Scum, as it\r\nrises, and pour the whole to cool, in an open Tub, and work it with\r\nAle-Yeast, spread upon a Toast of white Bread, for three Days, and then tun\r\nit into a Vessel that will just hold it; adding about a Pound and a half of\r\nRaisins of the Sun split, to lie in the Liquor till we draw it off, which\r\nshould not be till the Wine is fine, which you will find about _January_.\r\nThis Wine is so like the fine rich Wine brought from _Cyprus_, in its\r\nColour and Flavour, that it has deceiv'd the best Judges, These Berries are\r\nripe in _August_, and may be had at the Ivy-House at _Hoxton_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Wine_ of _Black Elder-berries,_ which is equal to the best\r\n_Hermitage_ Claret; from _Henry Marsh,_ Esq. _of Hammersmith._\r\n\r\nTake nine Gallons of Spring Water, and half a Bushel of Elder-berries,\r\npick'd clean from the Stalks; boil these till the Berries begin to dimple,\r\nthen gently strain off the Liquor, and to every Gallon of it put two Pounds\r\nof good _Lisbon_ Sugar, and boil it an Hour; then let it stand to cool, in\r\nan open Tub, for if it was to cool in the Copper, or Brass Kettle, it was\r\nboil'd in, the Liquor would be ill-tasted. When it is almost cool, spread\r\nsome Ale-Yeast upon a Toast of White Bread, and put it into the Liquor, to\r\nwork three Days in the open Tub, stirring the Liquor once or twice a Day,\r\nand then tun it in a Vessel of a right size, to hold it: At the same time\r\nadd to every Gallon one pound of Raisins of the Sun whole, and let them lie\r\nin the Cask till the Wine is drawn off.\r\n\r\nSuch a small quantity of Wine, as is here directed, will be fit to bottle\r\nthe _January_ next after it is made, but larger Casks should not be drawn\r\noff till _March_ or _April_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Receipt from _Barbadoes,_ to make _Rum;_ which proves very good.\r\n\r\nIn _Barbadoes_ the Rum is made of the Scum and Offal of the Sugar, of which\r\nthey put one ninth part, or eighth part, to common Water, about eighteen\r\nGallons, all together, in a wooden open Vessel or Tub; cover this with dry\r\nLeaves of Palm, or for want of them, with the Leaves of _Platanus_ or the\r\nLeaves of Fern in _England_, or the Parts or Leaves which Flagg-Brooms are\r\nmade of. Let this remain for nine Days, till it changes of a clean yellow\r\nColour, and it will be then fit to distil; then put it into an Alembic, and\r\nyou will have what we call the Low-Wines. A Day or two after distil it\r\nagain, and in the Cap of the Still, hang a small muslin Bag of sweet\r\nFennel-Seeds, and the Spirit will be of a fine Flavour. Some will use\r\nAnniseed in the Bag, and some use a little Musk with the sweet Fennel\r\nSeeds, or else distil the Spirit twice, _viz._, once with the sweet\r\nFennel-Seeds, and the next with a little Musk.\r\n\r\n_N.B._ The wooden Vessels, or open Tubs, must not be made of any Wood that\r\nis unwholesome, or sweet-scented; such as Deal, Firr, or Manchineel.\r\n\r\nIn _England_, Treacle may be used with equal Success, and is cheap enough\r\nto get a good livelihood; as appears by the several Ways mention'd above,\r\nthat have been privately experienced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Citron-Water,_ from _Barbadoes._\r\n\r\nTake Citron, or Lemon Flowers, for the word Citron in _French_ signifies\r\nLemon; though we generally in _England_ esteem the large Lemons to be\r\nCitrons, and the middle-siz'd we call Lemons, and the smallest of that race\r\nis call'd the Lime. In these, however, there are as many varieties as we\r\nhave in Apples, one is finer flavour'd than the other. The Oranges too are\r\nof as many different Sorts, the Rind of one pleasanter than the other, and\r\nthe Juice likewise, and so are the Flowers various in their Smells, some\r\nmore odorous than others; yet all these are used indifferently, according\r\nto the Kinds that happen to grow upon the several Estates, where the\r\nCitron-Water is made, and this is the Reason why one Sort is better than\r\nanother; and therefore, those who have the most pleasant Sorts, make the\r\nbest Waters of this Kind.\r\n\r\nWe must take, either of Citron, Lemon, or Orange-Flowers, four Ounces to a\r\nGallon of clean Spirit, or _French_-Brandy; put these in the Spirits, with\r\ntwo Pounds of white Sugar-Candy, beaten fine: then take of the best\r\nCitron-Peels, or Lemon-Peels, six Ounces, and let them steep in the Spirits\r\ntill the Liquor is strong enough of every Ingredient; and when that is\r\ndone, pour it off, through a Sieve. And in some places they put about half\r\na Drachm of Musk to six Gallons of Liquor; and this has been sold for\r\nsixteen Shillings the Quart in _London_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make fine _Vinegar._\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt but the making of Vinegar will be a considerable Article,\r\nseeing that few of our fine Preparations for the Table can be made without\r\nit. A Gentleman of great note has given me the following Receipt for it,\r\n_viz._\r\n\r\nTo nine Gallons of Water, put eighteen Pounds of _Malaga_ Raisins, chopt a\r\nlittle, Stalks and all; put this into a Cask, bound with Iron Hoops, and\r\nplace it in the warmest Exposure you can find in the open Air: then take a\r\n_Florence_ Flask, divested of its Straw, and put the Neck of it into the\r\nBung-hole, fixing it as close as may be, with some Linnen-Cloth, and a\r\nlittle Pitch and Rosin melted together. By this Means, if the Weather prove\r\nfair and warm, your Vinegar will be fit for Use in three Weeks time. The\r\nuse of the Glass, is, that in the heat of the Day it will fill itself with\r\nthe Liquor, and when the cool of the Evening comes on, that Liquor will\r\nagain be return'd into the Cask; by which means the Liquor will become sour\r\nmuch sooner than it will otherwise do. As soon as it is clear, draw it off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Irish Usquebaugh;_ from Lord _Capell's_ Receipt, when he was Lord\r\nLieutenant of _Ireland._\r\n\r\nTo every Gallon of _French_-Brandy, put one Ounce of Liquorice sliced, one\r\nOunce of sweet Fennel-Seeds, one Ounce of Anniseeds, one Pound of Raisins\r\nof the Sun split and stoned, a quarter of a Pound of Figs split, two\r\nDrachms of Coriander-Seeds, let these infuse about eight or nine Days, and\r\npour the Liquor clear off, then add half an Ounce of Saffron, in a Bag, for\r\na Day or two, and when that is out, put in a Drachm of Musk. If when this\r\nComposition is made, it seems to be too high a Cordial for the Stomach, put\r\nto it more Brandy, till you reduce it to the Temper you like. This is the\r\nsame Receipt King _William_ had when he was in _Ireland_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Green _Usquebaugh._\r\n\r\nTo every Gallon of _French_-Brandy put one Ounce of Anniseeds, and another\r\nof sweet Fennel-Seeds, two Drachms of Coriander-Seeds. Let these infuse\r\nnine Days, then take of the Spirit of Saffron one Drachm, distil'd from\r\nSpirit of Wine, mix with the rest; infuse during this time some Liquorice\r\nsliced in Spirits, one Pound of Raisins of the Sun, and filter it; put then\r\na Quart of pure White-Wine to a Gallon of the Liquor, and when all is mix'd\r\ntogether, take the Juice of Spinach boil'd, enough to colour it; but do not\r\nput the Spinach Juice into the Liquor till it is cold. To this put one\r\nPound of white Sugar candied, finely powder'd, to a Gallon of Liquor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make a _Cabbage-Pudding;_ from a Gentlewoman in _Suffolk,_ as it was\r\nwritten by herself.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYou will excuse me, if I send you a Receipt for a Pudding, which is\r\naccounted so agreeable by my Acquaintance, that they think it worth a place\r\nin your Book, call'd, _The Lady's Monthly Director_, in the Management of\r\nthe several Products of a Farm. It may as well be made by People of the\r\nlower as of the higher Rank.\r\n\r\nTake a Piece of boil'd Beef, which is not always done enough; the Parts of\r\nit which are the least done, and chop them small: take as much boil'd\r\nCabbage as you have Meat, and chop that as small as the Beef, season this\r\nwith Pepper and Salt, and two or three Eggs beaten, to mix it up in the\r\nmanner of farced Meat. Whatever else of seasoning you like, put it to it;\r\nand when it is made into a thin Paste, put the Mixture into a Linnen-Cloth,\r\nand boil it till it is enough, then serve it to the Table. But this Pudding\r\nis much better made with raw salt Beef and boil'd Cabbage, for is makes an\r\nextraordinary Paste, and is much softer and fuller of Gravey than the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n_N.B._ If it is of the first Sort, the quantity of half a Quartern Loaf of\r\nfine Bread, may boil an Hour, and the latter Sort may boil an Hour and a\r\nhalf.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _I am Yours,_\r\n    C. B.\r\n\r\n\r\nServe it with Butter and Gravey, with Lemon-Juice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the _Gourmandine-Pea,_ and its several Ways of Dressing.\r\n\r\n_P.S._ You have mention'd in one of your Books a sort of Pea, which is\r\ncall'd the Gourmandine, or Gourmand; which I suppose one may call, in\r\n_English_, the Glutton's Pea, because we eat all of it. For the Pods of it\r\nare very sweet and have no Film, or Skin in them, so that the Cods may be\r\nas well eaten as the Peas themselves; for which reason, when we have drawn\r\nthe Strings from them, as we do from Kidney Beans, you may broil them upon\r\na Gridiron, and serving them with gravey Sauce, they are very good; or to\r\ncut them into Pieces, and fry them with Mutton Steaks; or else you may fry\r\nthem with Beef, and they are still better. But the best way, is to cut them\r\ncross, as you do _French_-Beans, and stew them in Gravey with a little\r\nPepper and Salt, there is not any thing in my Opinion can eat better, and\r\nto be put in a gravey Soop, are incomparable; especially, if they have been\r\nparboil'd, and rubb'd dry, and then fry'd in burnt Butter.\r\n\r\nThe smallest dwarf crooked Sugar-Pea, that you recommend, is of the same\r\nquality, but rather better, for all these Uses, being somewhat sweeter than\r\nthe former, and the Pod fuller of Pulp.\r\n\r\nC. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Verjuice_ of Grapes, unripe, or of Crab-Apples; from _J. S._ Esq.\r\n\r\nTake Grapes full grown, just before they begin to ripen, and bruise them,\r\nwithout the trouble of picking them from the Bunches; then put them in a\r\nBag, made of Horse-Hair, and press them till the Juice is discharged; put\r\nthis Liquor into a Stone Jar, leaving it uncover'd for some Days, then\r\nclose it and keep it for use. This Verjuice is much richer than that of the\r\nCrab-Apple, and has a much greater influence in the way of\r\nCallico-Printing; but is harder to come at, few People being willing to\r\ngather their Grapes unripe; but where there is a large Quantity, it is well\r\nworth while. _N.B._ It will do well, if the Liquor is put into common\r\nCasks, but is nicer to the Palate if it is kept in glazed Jars of about\r\neight or nine Gallons, and the Berries might then be pick'd from the\r\nStalks. Keep this in a good Vault, and it will remain good for three or\r\nfour Years as Verjuice; but a little more time will make it lose its\r\nSourness, and it will become like Wine.\r\n\r\nThe Verjuice of Crab-Apples should be made of the wild Crab, which produces\r\nThorns on its Branches, and brings a small round Apple, such as are common\r\nto be planted for Fences. I am the more particular in this, because some\r\nApples, which are call'd Wildings, are supposed to have a sharp juice, but\r\nsuch will soften by keeping a Year or two. Take the Crabs, I speak of, in\r\n_October_, and grind them in a Mill, such as they use for making Cyder;\r\nthen press the Liquor, and put it into Vessels like the former. Besides the\r\nagreeable Taste this has, as an _Agresta_ at the Table, it is good for the\r\nCallico Printers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA dry Travelling Powder, for Sauce, or Pocket-Sauce. From _Mynheer\r\nVanderport_ of _Antwerp._\r\n\r\nTake pickled Mango, and let it dry three or four Days in the Room; then\r\nreduce it to Powder by means of a Grater. Take of this Powder six Ounces,\r\nto which add three Ounces of Mushrooms, dry'd in a gentle Oven, and reduced\r\nto Powder, by beating in a Mortar; add to this, a Dram of Mace powder'd,\r\nhalf as much Cloves powder'd; or in their room, a large Nutmeg grated, and\r\na Dram of black Pepper, beat fine: mix these Ingredients well together, and\r\nsift them through an open HairSieve: and half a Tea spoonful, or less, of\r\nthe Powder will relish any Sauce you have a mind to make, though it be a\r\nquart or more, putting it into the Sauce, when it is warm. To this, one may\r\nadd about nine Grains of sweet Basil, dry'd and powder'd; or of Summer\r\nsweet Marjoram powder'd. If we use this Sauce for Fish, it is extremely\r\ngood, adding only a little Anchovy Liquor and white Wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo preserve _Grapes_ all the Winter.\r\n\r\nTake an Earthen Jar, well glaz'd, that will hold about six Gallons, or\r\nmore; then dry some Oats, a little, in the Sun, upon Leads if you can, so\r\nthat they have lost some part of their Moisture; lay them then two Inches\r\nthick, at the bottom of the Jar, and upon them, your Bunches of Grapes,\r\ngathered full ripe and dry; and if in any Bunch there is a rotted Grape,\r\ncut it off, and see that your Bunches are quite clean in their Berries; and\r\nbesides, that all the Parts you have cut the Grapes from, are quite dry.\r\nLay these on the Oats, and upon them put two Inches thick of Oats, dry'd as\r\nbefore; and on them again, a Layer of Grapes, and so the Oats upon them,\r\ncontinuing this Practice till the Vessel is full. Then take a Cork, well\r\nsoak'd in Oil, and stop it close in the Jar, and seal it up with Pitch,\r\nBees-Wax, and a little Rosin, melted together, and keep it in a cool Place;\r\nbut to bury it three Foot under ground, is better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Collar of _Mutton_ roasted. From _St. Edmund's-Bury_ in _Suffolk._\r\n\r\nTake a Coast of Mutton, which is the Neck and Breast together, skin it in\r\nthe whole Piece; then parboil it, and prepare a Mixture of Crumbs of Bread;\r\nLemon-Peel grated, a little Pepper, Salt, Nutmeg, or sweet Marjoram\r\npowder'd, which answers the End of most Spices, or else a little dry'd\r\nsweet Basil, which we call _Bush-Basil_, in the Gardens. To this, add the\r\nYolks of six hard Eggs, beat in a Mortar, with six Ounces of Butter; mix\r\nthis with the other Ingredients; then take the inside of the Mutton, and\r\ncover it with this Mixture, and roll it up as close as can be, and secure\r\nit in the Roll; so that it may be close for the Spit. It must be spitted\r\nthrough the Middle length-ways, and basted with Butter, salting it every\r\nnow and then, and the Gratings of Crusts of Bred should be sprinkled upon\r\nit, with the seasoning above. Just before it is enough, when it is taken\r\noff the Spit, serve it with strong Gravey and Lemon or Orange Juice, and\r\ngarnish with Lemon or Orange sliced; or when Oysters are in season, add\r\nfry'd Oysters: _viz._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo fry _Oysters_ for a Plate, or the Garnish of the foregoing Dish.\r\n\r\nMake a Batter of Eggs and Flower, Crumbs of Bread, and a little Mace,\r\nbeaten fine. Stew some large Oysters in their own Liquor gently, and wipe\r\nthem dry, and flower them: dip them, after this, in the Batter, and fry\r\nthem in very hot Butter, or Lard, or Seam of an Hog; and they will be\r\nincrustated, or cover'd, with a sort of Paste, which will be very\r\nagreeable, either for a Plate, or to garnish a Dish. If we have them alone,\r\nserve them with some of the Liquor, a little Butter, some White Wine,\r\nboiling first some Spices in the Liquor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf a _Sturgeon,_ how it ought to be cured, for cold Meat, or dressed hot\r\nfor the Table.\r\n\r\nThe Sturgeon is a Fish commonly found in the Northern Seas; but now and\r\nthen, we find them in our great Rivers; the _Thames_, the _Severn_ and the\r\n_Tyne_. This Fish is of a very large size; even sometimes to measure\r\neighteen Foot in length. They are in great esteem when they are fresh\r\ntaken, to be cut in Pieces, of eight or ten Pounds, and roasted or baked;\r\nbesides, to be pickled and preserv'd for cold Treats: And moreover, the\r\nCaviar, which is esteem'd a Dainty, is the Spawn of this Fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Cure, or Pickle, _Sturgeon;_ from _Hamborough._\r\n\r\nTake a Sturgeon, gut it and clean it very well, within side, with Salt and\r\nWater; and in the same manner clean the Outside, wiping both very dry with\r\ncoarse Cloths, without taking any of the great Scales from it: then take\r\noff the Head, the Fins and Tail; and if there is any Spawn in it, save it\r\nto be cured for Caviar. When this is done, cut your Fish into small Pieces,\r\nof about four Pounds each, and take out the Bones, as clean as possible,\r\nand lay them in Salt and Water for twenty-four Hours; then dry them well\r\nwith coarse Cloths; and such Pieces as want to be rolled up, tie them close\r\nwith Bass-strings, that is, the strings of Bark which compose the Bass\r\nMats, such as the Gardeners use: for that being flat, like Tape, will keep\r\nthe Fish close in the boiling, which would otherwise break, if it was tied\r\nwith Pack-Thread. Strew some Salt over the Pieces, and let them lie three\r\nDays; then provide a piece of Wicker, made flat, aid wide as the Copper or\r\nCauldron you will boil your Fish in, with two or three Strings, fasten'd to\r\nthe Edges, the Ends of which should hang over the Edges of the Copper. The\r\nPans we generally boil our Fish in, are shallow and very broad; then make\r\nthe following Pickle, _viz._ one Gallon of Vinegar to four Gallons of\r\nWater, and to that quantity put four Pounds of Salt. When this boils, put\r\nin your Fish; and when it is boil'd enough, take it out, and lay it in\r\nsingle Pieces, upon Hurdles, to drain, or upon such Boards as will not give\r\nany extraordinary Taste to the Fish. Some will boil in this Pickle a\r\nquarter of a Pound of whole black Pepper.\r\n\r\nWhen your Fish is quite cold, lay it in clean Tubs, which are call'd Kits,\r\nand cover it with the Liquor it was boil'd in, and close it up, to be kept\r\nfor Use.\r\n\r\nIf at any time you perceive the Liquor to grow mouldy, or begin to mother,\r\npass it through a Sieve; add some fresh Vinegar to it, and boil it: and\r\nwhen it is quite cold, wash your Fish in some of it, and lay your Pieces\r\na-fresh in the Tub, covering them with Liquor as before, and it will keep\r\ngood several Months. This is generally eaten with Oil and Vinegar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo prepare the _Caviar,_ or _Spawn,_ of the _Sturgeon._\r\n\r\nWash it well in Vinegar and Water, and then lay it in Salt and Water two or\r\nthree Days; then boil it in fresh Water and Salt; and when it is cold, put\r\nit up for Use. This is eaten upon Toasts of white Bread with a little Oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Roast a piece of fresh _Sturgeon;_ from Mr. _Ralph Titchbourn,_ Cook.\r\n\r\nTake a piece of fresh Sturgeon, of about eight or ten Pounds; let it lie in\r\nWater and Salt, six or eight Hours, with its great Scales on: then fasten\r\nit on the Spit, and baste it well with Butter for a quarter of an Hour; and\r\nafter that, drudge it with grated Bread, Flour, some Nutmeg, a little Mace\r\npowder'd, Pepper and Salt, and some sweet Herbs dry'd and powder'd,\r\ncontinuing basting and drudging of it till it is enough. Then serve it up\r\nwith the following Sauce, _viz._ one Pint of thin Gravey and Oyster Liquor,\r\nwith some Horse-Radish, Lemon-Peel, a bunch of sweet Herbs, some whole\r\nPepper, and a few Blades of Mace, with a whole Onion, an Anchovy, a\r\nspoonfull or two of liquid Katchep, or some Liquor of pickled Walnuts, with\r\nhalf a Pint of White Wine: strain it off, and put in as much Butter as will\r\nthicken it. To this put Oysters parboil'd, Shrimps or Prawns pickt, or the\r\ninside of a Crab, which will make the same Sauce very rich; then garnish\r\nwith fry'd Oysters, Lemon sliced, butter'd Crabs and fry'd Bread, cut in\r\nhandsome Figures, and pickled Mushrooms. _N.B._ If you have no Katchep, you\r\nmay use Mushroom Gravey, mention'd in the first Part of your Treatise, or\r\nsome of the travelling Sauce in the same Book, or else a small Tea spoonful\r\nof the dry Pocket-Sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Roast a Collar, or Fillet, of _Sturgeon;_ from the same.\r\n\r\nTake a piece of fresh Sturgeon; take out the Bones, and cut the fleshy Part\r\ninto Lengths, about seven or eight Inches; then provide some Shrimps, chopt\r\nsmall with Oysters; some Crumbs of Bread, and such seasoning of Spice as\r\nyou like, with a little Lemon-Peel grated. When this is done, butter one\r\nside of your Fish, and strew some of your Mixture upon it; then begin to\r\nroll it up, as close as possible, and when the first Piece is rolled up,\r\nthen roll upon that another, prepared as before, and bind it round with a\r\nnarrow Fillet, leaving as much of the Fish apparent as may be. But you must\r\nremark, that the Roll should not be above four Inches and a half thick;\r\nfor, else one Part would be done enough before the Inside was hardly\r\nwarm'd: therefore, I have sometimes parboil'd the inside Roll before I\r\nbegan to roll it.\r\n\r\nWhen it is at the Fire, baste it well with Butter, and drudge it with\r\nsifted Raspings of Bread. Serve it with the same Sauce as directed for the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Piece of fresh _Sturgeon_ boiled; from the same.\r\n\r\nWhen your Sturgeon is clean, prepare as much Liquor to boil it in, as will\r\ncover it; that is, take a Pint of Vinegar to about two Quarts of Water, a\r\nstick of Horse-Radish, two or three bits of Lemon-Peel, some whole Pepper,\r\na Bay-leaf or two, and a small handful of Salt; boil your Fish in this,\r\ntill it is enough, and serve it with the following Sauce.\r\n\r\nMelt a pound of Butter; then add some Anchovy Liquor; Oyster Liquor; some\r\nWhite Wine; some Katchep boil'd together with whole Pepper and Mace\r\nstrain'd; put to this the Body of a Crab, and serve it with a little\r\nLemon-Juice. You may likewise put in some Shrimps, the Tails of Lobsters,\r\ncut to Pieces, stew'd Oysters, or Cray-fish cut into small Bits: garnish\r\nwith pickled Mushrooms and roasted or fry'd Oysters, Lemon sliced, and\r\nHorse-Radish scraped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make a _Sturgeon-_Pye; from the same.\r\n\r\nPut to a quartern of Flour, two Pounds of Butter, and rub a third Part in;\r\nthen make it into a Paste with Water, and roll the rest in at three times;\r\nthen roll out your Bottom, and when it is in the Dish, lay some Butter, in\r\npieces, upon it; and strew on that, a little Pepper and Salt. Then cut your\r\nSturgeon in Slices cross-ways, about three quarters of an Inch thick,\r\nseasoning them with Pepper, Salt, Nutmeg and Lemon-Peel grated, till your\r\nPye is full, and on the Top lay on Pieces of Butter; then close it, and put\r\nin, just before it goes to the Oven, some White Wine and Water; and when it\r\nis bak'd, serve it: garnish it with sliced Lemon, or Orange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo butter _Crabs,_ from the same, for Garnish for the foregoing Dishes, or\r\nto be served by themselves.\r\n\r\nTake middle-siz'd Sea-Crabs; break the Claws, and pick them; then take out\r\nthe Body, free from all the Films and boney Parts; mix these together with\r\nsome Pepper and Salt, to your mind; and when you have heated some White\r\nWine over the Fire, put your Mixture into it, and stir it well together,\r\nand keep it warm in a gentle Oven, till you want it for Use: and just\r\nbefore you use it, pour into your Mixture a little melted Butter, and stir\r\nit well in; then clean your Shells, as well as possible, in hot Water, and\r\nput in your Mixture, and serve it to the Table hot. Or this Mixture may be\r\nserv'd on a Plate, upon Sippets, with Slices of Lemon or Orange. You should\r\nfry the Sippets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Manner of Pickling and Drying of _Sheeps_ Tongues, or _Hogs_ Tongues,\r\nwhich they call _Stags_ Tongues; from a celebrated Practitioner of forty\r\nYears standing in _London._\r\n\r\nThe Sheeps Tongues, which are commonly bought in the _London_ Markets, are\r\nthe best, if they are the Tongues of Wethers, fed in low Lands; being the\r\nlargest, as they are taken from the largest sort of Sheep: but the Tongues\r\nof all Sorts of Sheep are good enough to be worth Pickling. But there is\r\nthis Difference in the Value, that one large Tongue, well cured, will sell\r\nfor three Pence, while the smallest Sort, cured in the same manner, will\r\nonly sell for Three Half-pence, or a Penny. These Tongues are bought in\r\nQuantities of the Carcass Butchers, about _Whitechappel_, and other\r\nButchers about Town, who kill from One hundred to Six hundred Sheep in a\r\nDay, each Butcher; and they know very well how to cut out the Tongues, with\r\nall their Parts to advantage: but they are afterwards trimm'd, when we\r\nreceive them, into a more regular Shape; by those who cure them. When we\r\nare about this Work, there is one thing necessary to be observ'd,\r\nespecially in hot Weather, but always it is best to be done; which is, cut\r\nthe fleshy Part of the Bottom of the Tongue length-ways, and you will find,\r\ntowards the Root, an Artery, which as soon as 'tis cut will bleed, and\r\njoining to that is a kind of Sweet-bread; take these out, as clean as you\r\ncan, without disfiguring the Tongue; otherwise the Tongues will have an\r\nungrateful Smell, and putrify: so, that if you deal by Wholesale, they will\r\nbe return'd upon your hands, or be a trouble to the Family where they are\r\nmade. Wash these well, after trimming, in Salt and Water, and then salt\r\nthem with common Salt, well dry'd, in an Iron Kettle; one pound to half an\r\nOunce of Salt-Petre, or Nitre, powder'd and well mix'd. Rub them well with\r\nthe Mixture, and lay them close together in a Tub, or glaz'd earthen\r\nVessel; and, after a few Days, when they are salt enough, take them from\r\nthe Pickle, and when they are a little dry, tie them by the Tips, half a\r\ndozen together; and hang them up in a Chimney, where Deal Saw-Dust is\r\nburnt, till they are smoked enough, to be cured for boiling; then boil them\r\nin their Bunches, and let them dry for Sale. But to come a quicker Way to\r\ncure these Tongues, in the Pickle, as we do generally, is to make a Brine\r\nor Pickle in the following manner; that is, take a quantity of Water, and\r\nmake a Pickle of it with common Salt, boil'd till it will bear an Egg; and\r\nthen put in to every Pound of Salt, half an Ounce of Nitre, or Salt-Petre;\r\nand when the Pickle is cold, throw in your Tongues: which is the quickest\r\nWay. But for drying of them, the Smoking-Closets will do perfectly well,\r\nonly we have not always those Conveniencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Smoking-Closets,_\r\n\r\nIt is to be observ'd, from your own Writings, That the Smoking-Closets are\r\nof great use in curing of Hams; and they are no less useful in drying of\r\nTongues. I have, in a place, in the Country, one of them in a Garret, where\r\nwe enclose a Room of ten foot Square, where is a Chimney, into which, by a\r\nRegister, we let in the Smoke from the Fire, which is made on a Hearth, on\r\nthe ground Floor; so that the Smoke then does not come too hot on the\r\nTongues, and so preserves them from turning rusty. This is much the best\r\nway of curing them, and one may cure, in such a Room, fourscore dozen at a\r\ntime. This Place, likewise, we cure our Hung-Beef in. We have try'd some\r\nSheeps Tongues, salted only in a Brine of common Salt, and dry'd in such a\r\nRoom; and they are very red, and well tasted, though there is no Salt-Petre\r\nused in the Pickle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA _Carp_ Pye. From Mrs. _Mary Gordon._\r\n\r\nPut to a quartern of Flour a pound and a half of Butter, rubbing a third\r\npart in; and make it into a Paste with Water: then roll in the rest of the\r\nButter, at two or three times, and lay your Paste in the Dish, putting some\r\nbits of Butter, on the bottom Paste, with some Salt and Pepper, at\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\nThen scale and gut your Carp, and wash it with Vinegar, and dry it well;\r\nand make the following Pudding for the Belly of the Carp: _viz._ Take the\r\nFlesh of an Eel, and mince it very small; add some grated Bread, some dry'd\r\nsweet Marjoram powder'd, two butter'd Eggs, a small Anchovy minced, a\r\nlittle Nutmeg grated, and some Salt and Pepper; mix this well, and fill the\r\nBelly of the Carp with it; and for the remaining Part, make it into Balls.\r\nThen cut off the Tail and Fins of the Carp, and lay it in the Crust, with\r\nthe Balls about it; some Mushroom Buttons, Oysters with their Fins taken\r\noff, and some Shrimps, a few Slices of Lemon, and some thin Slices of fat\r\nBacon, a little Mace and some bits of Butter: then close it, and before you\r\nput it into the Oven, pour in half a Pint of Claret. Serve this Pye hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Biscuits of _Potatoes._ From the same.\r\n\r\nBoil the Roots of Potatoes, till they are tender; then peel them, and take\r\ntheir weight of fine Sugar, finely sifted; grate some Lemon-Peel on the\r\nSugar; and then beat the Potatoes and Sugar together, in a Stone Mortar,\r\nwith some Butter, a little Mace, or Cloves, finely sifted, and a little Gum\r\nDragon, steeped in Orange-Flower-Water, or Rose-Water, till it becomes a\r\nPaste; then make it into Cakes with Sugar, finely powder'd, and dry them in\r\na gentle Oven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Biscuits_ of Red _Beet-Roots;_ from the same; call'd the _Crimson\r\nBiscuit._\r\n\r\nTake the Roots of Red-Beets, and boil them tender; clean them, and beat\r\nthem in a Mortar with as much Sugar, finely sifted; some Butter; the Yolks\r\nof hard Eggs, a little Flower; some Spice, finely beaten, and some\r\nOrange-Flower-Water, and a little Lemon-Juice. When they are well mix'd,\r\nand reduced to a Paste, make them into Cakes, and dry them in a slow Oven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo boil _Onions,_ that they shall lose their strong Scent, and become as\r\nsweet as Sugar in their Taste. From the same.\r\n\r\nTake the largest Onions, and when you have cut off the Strings of the\r\nRoots, and the green Tops, without taking off any of the Skins, fling them\r\ninto Salt and Water, and let them lie an Hour; then wash them in it, and\r\nput them into a Kettle, where they may have plenty of Water, and boil them,\r\ntill they are tender. Then take them off, and take off as many Skins, as\r\nyou think fit, till you come to the white Part, and then bruise them, if\r\nyou will, and toss them up with Cream or Butter, if you use them with\r\nboil'd Rabbits, or under a roasted Turkey; but in the last Case, this Sauce\r\nshould be serv'd in Basons, or on Plates. You may also bruise them, and\r\nstrain them through a Cullendar, and then put Cream to them; which is\r\nesteem'd the nicest way for a Turkey; or if you keep them whole, you may\r\nwarm them in strong Gravey, well drawn, with Spice and sweet Herbs; and\r\nwhen that is done, thicken the Gravey with burnt Butter, adding a little\r\nClaret, or White Wine; or, for want of that, a little Ale. This is a Sauce\r\nfor a Turkey roasted, or roast Mutton, or Lamb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hungary-Water._ From Mrs. _Du Pont,_ of _Lyons;_ which is the same, which\r\nhas been famous, about _Montpelier._\r\n\r\nTake to every Gallon of Brandy, or clean Spirits, one handful of Rosemary,\r\none handful of Lavender. I suppose the handfuls to be about a Foot long\r\na-piece; and these Herbs must be cut in Pieces, about an Inch long. Put\r\nthese to infuse in the Spirits, and with them, about an handful of Myrtle,\r\ncut as before. When this has stood three Days, distil it, and you will have\r\nthe finest Hungary-Water that can be. It has been said, that Rosemary\r\nFlowers are better than the Stalks; but they give a faintness to the Water,\r\nand should not be used, because they have a quite different Smell from the\r\nRosemary; nor should the Flowers of Myrtle be used in lieu of the Myrtle,\r\nfor they have a scent ungrateful, and not at all like the Myrtle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Manner of making the famous _Barcelona Snuff,_ as it was perform'd at\r\nthe _Lyon_ at _Barcelona;_ from the same. This is also call'd _Myrtle\r\nSnuff._\r\n\r\nTake _Seville_ Snuff, and prepare a dry Barrel, that has not had any Wine\r\nin it, or of any Scent; then cut the fresh Tops of Myrtle, and lay a layer\r\nof them at the bottom of the Cask, an Inch or two thick; then lay Snuff on\r\nthat as thick, and lay on more Myrtle, two Inches; then again, put on\r\nSnuff, and so fill the Barrel in the same Manner, _Stratum super Stratum_.\r\nThen press it down with a Board, that will fit, and set three Weights upon\r\nit of a quarter of an Hundred a-piece, and let it stand four and twenty\r\nHours; then turn it out, and sift it, flinging the Myrtle away; then put it\r\ninto the Cask, as before, with fresh Myrtle, and serve it so three times,\r\nand sift it off. When this is done, add to every ten Pounds of Snuff, one\r\npound of Orangery Snuff, and mix the whole very well, and after three days,\r\nput it into glaz'd Pots, well pressed into them, and stopt close; or else\r\ninto Leaden Pots: which last is rather the best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Orangery Snuff._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake _Seville_ Snuff and Orange-Flowers, fresh gather'd early in the\r\nMorning. And in a glaz'd Earthen Vessel, lay a Layer of the Flowers, then a\r\nLayer of Snuff, then a Layer of Flowers; and so on, till the Pot is full.\r\nPress it down very gently, and let the Mouth of the Pot be open for\r\ntwenty-four Hours; then turn all out, and sift your Snuff, and lay in fresh\r\nFlowers, with Snuff, in the same manner as before; and at the end of four\r\nand twenty Hours sift it off again, and repeat the same the third time:\r\nbeing sure that the Flowers do not remain longer than twenty-four Hours,\r\nelse they will sour the Snuff. In making this Snuff, you ought to allow at\r\nleast a pound for Waste, for the Flowers will gather a great deal of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Orange-Butter._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake Hogs-Lard (or as in some Places, call'd Hogs-Seame) wash this well in\r\nSpring-Water, beating it all the while with a piece of Wood; then take\r\nOrange-Flowers, fresh gather'd, and melt the Lard gently, and put about a\r\nquarter of a pound of the Flowers into a pound of Lard; let them remain ten\r\nMinutes, gently keeping them warm over the Fire; then strain it off, and\r\nwhen the Lard is again cold, beat it, and wash it with Orange-Flower-Water.\r\nThen melt it gently a second time, and put in fresh Flowers, in the same\r\nmanner as before, and it will become of a yellow Colour; and, when it is\r\ncool, beat it again with a wooden Paddle and Orange-Flower-Water, and then\r\nput it into Pots for use. I should remark, that the Lard should be melted\r\nby putting it in a glazed Vessel, and melting it by putting the Vessel into\r\nboiling Water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Flour of _Mustard._\r\n\r\nThose who live in the Country, or go to Sea, have frequent occasion to use\r\nMustard, when there is no opportunity of getting it without extraordinary\r\nTrouble. It is a Sauce seldom thought on till the Minute we want it; and\r\nthen, according to the old Way of making it, if we are lucky enough to have\r\nMustard-Seed in the House, we must spend an Hour in the Ceremony of\r\ngrinding it in a wooden Bowl, and an Iron Cannon-Bullet, according to the\r\nold Custom; or, if we have Mustard by us, ready made, if it has stood a\r\nWeek, it is then of no value, if it is in small quantity. But to obviate\r\nthis Difficulty, the Invention of grinding Mustard-Seed in a Mill, and\r\nthereby reducing of it to Flour, to be made fit for the Table in an\r\ninstant, has been very well received: for by that Contrivance we have it\r\nalways fresh, and full of brisk Spirits, and may only make just what we\r\nwant without any spoil, as long as we keep a Stock of this Flour by us.\r\n\r\nThere are two Sorts of Mustard: _viz._ The white Sort, which is a large\r\nGrain, and not so strong; and the black Sort, which is a small Grain. That\r\nwhich I account the best, is from the wild Mustard, commonly found growing\r\nin _Essex_, which sells the best in the Markets. But from whatever Place we\r\nhave it, regard should be chiefly had to its being free from Mustiness,\r\nwhich happens from the gathering the Seed wet, or in the Dew, and laying it\r\nclose together before it is thresh'd. When this Seed is dry and sweet,\r\ngrind it in a Mill, such as a Coffee-Mill; but the Mill must be fresh, and\r\nfree from any Flavour or Taint: it should not indeed be used with any other\r\nthing. When you have ground a sufficient Quantity, pass it through a pretty\r\nopen Sieve, and the next day put it into Vials with open Mouths, pressing\r\nit down close; stop them well, and keep it for use. When you want good\r\nMustard for the Table, take a spoonful or two of this Flour, and as much\r\nboiling Liquor from the Pot, where Beef or Pork is boiled, as will make it\r\nof the Consistence you desire, stirring it well till it is mixt for your\r\nPurpose; or for want of such Liquor, boil a little Salt and Water together,\r\nand mix your Mustard-Flour with that; but in either of these Ways you must\r\nobserve, that while your Mustard is warm, it will last better.\r\n\r\nSome who do not love their Mustard overstrong, put equal Quantities of the\r\nwhite and black Mustard-Seed into the Mill, and then the Flour will not be\r\nso poignant to the Palate, and will have a brighter Look. If your Mill be\r\nset very sharp, the Flour will be so fine, that it need hardly be sifted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo keep _Anchovys_ good for a long time. From Mrs. _M. N._\r\n\r\nAs the People in the Country have not always the conveniency of a Market\r\nnear them, and the Anchovy is often required for Fish-Sauce; so should\r\nevery Family keep a quantity by them. They should be large, and fresh\r\nbrought over when we buy them, and feel firm to the Finger; neither should\r\nthey have their Heads on, for they are then more apt to turn rancid and\r\nstink; and if we buy them in large Quantities, the frequent opening the Pot\r\nwe keep them in will subject them to Change. But to prevent this, as the\r\nLiquor falls or shrinks, add Vinegar to them, which will continue them firm\r\nand free from Rotting for two Years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Roast a Shoulder of _Mutton_ like _Venison._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake a Shoulder of Mutton, and skin it; then lay it in the fresh Blood of a\r\nSheep, well stirr'd with a little Salt, as it is bleeding, for six or eight\r\nHours. When you have done this, wash it in Water and Salt, and at last with\r\nVinegar; or else you may steep it in an Infusion of warm Water, a Gallon,\r\nand half a quarter of an Ounce of _Brazil_-Wood rasp'd. You may steep it in\r\nthis Liquor for four Hours, or else you may let it pass half an Hour in a\r\ngentle Oven with Water and Salt, and a small Piece of _Brazil_-Wood in it;\r\neither of which will give it a Colour: but I think the two last are better\r\nthan the Blood. Roast it then for its time, basting it well with Water and\r\nSalt, till it is near enough, and then give it a little sprinkling of Salt\r\nand raspings of Bread, with some Flour well mixt. The Sauce for this is\r\nClaret boil'd with Cinnamon, sweetned with a little Sugar and Crumbs of\r\nBread grated: but some will use the Claret, Sugar and Cinnamon without the\r\nCrumbs, in Saucers; as it is now the most common way in Noblemens Families\r\nto do Venison. But in the Dish with the artificial Shoulder of Venison, put\r\na strong Gravey of Beef; or made of some of the Beef-Glue which you have\r\nrecommended in your Book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make a _Hare-Pye,_ for a cold Treat. From the same.\r\n\r\nTake the Flesh of an Hare, and beat it in a Marble Mortar; then add as many\r\nbutter'd Eggs as will almost equal the Quantity of the Hare's-Flesh. Mix\r\nthese together with a little fat Bacon cut small, some Pepper and Salt, and\r\na little powder of Cloves and Mace, or sweet Marjoram, to your Pleasure,\r\nand mix them very well; then lay in your Paste, and butter it well at the\r\nbottom with some seasoning, strew'd upon it, and lay in your Preparation,\r\nand cover it with Butter; then close it, and serve it when it is cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo preserve _Ginger,_ and reduce the common _Ginger_ for that purpose. From\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nTake the large Roots of Ginger, and pour scalding Water upon them; and when\r\nthat is cool, pour on some more scalding Water: and so repeat the same till\r\nthe seventh or eighth time, or till you find the Ginger soft, and very much\r\nswell'd. Then warm some White Wine, and put it in that, for a few Hours,\r\nstirring it frequently while it is in any of the Liquors. Boil the last\r\nLiquor with fine Sugar to a Syrup; then put in your Ginger, and boil it for\r\nsome time; then set it by till the next day, and repeat the boiling of the\r\nGinger, adding every now and then a little White Wine, till the Ginger\r\nbegins to look a little clear; and when it is cold, put it into Glasses, or\r\nglazed Jars, stopping it close.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marmalade_ of _Oranges_ and _Lemons._ From the same.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to boil the Rinds of each in several Waters, till the\r\nBitterness is lost, and that they are reduced to a tenderness, such as you\r\nlike; then beat them in a Marble Mortar with as much of the Pulp of\r\nGolden-Pippins, or Golden-Rennets, as you think proper. Then take their\r\nweight of Sugar well powder'd, and a Pint of Water to every Pound of Sugar;\r\nboil your Sugar and Water, and when you have made a Syrup, put in your\r\nPulp, and boil them all together till they are clear. Then put in the Juice\r\nof Oranges and Lemons, so much as will give you the Taste you desire; then\r\nboil it over again till it jellies, and put it into Glasses, Keep this in a\r\ndry Place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Syrup_ of _Mulberries._ From the same.\r\n\r\nPress out the Juice of Mulberries with your Hands, and pass it through a\r\nSieve; and when it has stood to settle, pour off the clear, and put to it,\r\nits Weight of fine Sugar; put this into a Gallypot, and set that Pot into a\r\nKettle of hot Water, which should be kept simmering near two Hours: stir\r\nthe Syrup every now and then with a Silver Spoon, and take off what Scum\r\nmay rise at Times, upon it; when it is enough, let it stand till it is\r\nquite cold, and then put it into clear dry Bottles with large Mouths, and\r\nstop them close. Keep this in a dry Place.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remark'd, that besides this Syrup is very cooling; its use is\r\nto colour stew'd Apples, or Puddings, or any sweet Preparation made with\r\nFlour or Fruit: for in itself it carries no Flavour that will be\r\npredominant over that of another Fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf _Syrup_ of _Raspberries, Currans,_ or other Fruits. From the same.\r\n\r\nThese Syrups are made like the former, by pressing out the Juice with the\r\nHands; because if the Seeds are broken, they would have an ill Taste. Treat\r\nthese in the making just in the same way as the former, and use them in the\r\nsame manner, to colour any sweet Preparation; but remember, where you put\r\nany of the Raspberry Syrup, the Flavour of the Raspberry will prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make a _Raspberry-_Pudding. From the same.\r\n\r\nTake a Pint of Cream, and grate into it four Penny _Naples_ Biscuits; then\r\ntake the Yolks of eight hard Eggs chopt and broken small; then beat four\r\nEggs and put in two spoonfuls of Flour, and as much Powder of\r\ndouble-refined Sugar; then put in as much Syrup of Raspberries as you think\r\nproper to give it a Flavour and a Colour. If you find that your Composition\r\nis not thick enough, you may grate in more _Naples_ Biscuit. Mix all this\r\nwell together, and, if you will, make a fine Crust roll'd thin and laid in\r\na Dish, and bake it in a gentle Oven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parsnip-Cakes._ From the same.\r\n\r\nScrape some Parsnip-Roots, and slice them thin, dry them in an Oven and\r\nbeat them to Powder; mix them then with an equal quantity of Flour, and\r\nmake them up with Cream and Spices powder'd; then mould them into Cakes,\r\nand bake them in a gentle Oven. _N.B._ The sweetness of the Parsnip Powder\r\nanswers the want of Sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Raspberry_ bak'd Cakes. From the same.\r\n\r\nTake Potatoes and boil them, and when they are peel'd, beat them in a\r\nMarble Mortar with half the Quantity of fine Sugar powder'd; then put in\r\nsome of your Raspberry Syrup, till it is coloured with it, and make up your\r\nCakes in fine Sugar powder'd. Then dry them, or bake them, in a gentle\r\nOven, _Note_, these Cakes should be made thin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf _Ortolans._ From Mr. _Renaud._\r\n\r\nThe _Ortolan_ is a Bird brought from _France_, and is fed in large Cages\r\nwith Canary-Seeds till they become a lump of Fat; and when they are fully\r\nfatted, they must be killed, or else they will feed upon their own Flesh.\r\nWhen we kill them, you must take them by the Beak, and holding it close\r\nbetween your Finger and Thumb, the Bird will be stifled in about a Minute;\r\nthen pick off the Feathers even those of the Head, and pass a fine Skewer\r\nthrough them, just under the Wings, and roast them quick; setting small\r\nToasts under them to drip upon. Serve them with strong Gravey, and as much\r\nWhite Wine hot, and garnish with Slices of Lemon and Raspings of Bread\r\nsifted and toasted before the Fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Sugar Comfits_ of any Sort. From Mrs. _Anne Shepherd_ of\r\n_Norwich._\r\n\r\nThe Seeds which we generally make Comfitts of, are Carraways, Coriander and\r\nAnise-Seeds; these, when they are cover'd with Sugar, are call'd Comfits,\r\n(_Confects_).\r\n\r\nThe Instruments to be employ'd for this Use, are first a deep-bottom'd\r\nBason of Bell-Metal, or Brass, well tinn'd, to be hung over some hot Coals.\r\n\r\nSecondly, You must have a broad Pan to put hot Coals in.\r\n\r\nThirdly, Provide a Brass Ladle to pour the Sugar upon the Seeds.\r\n\r\nFourthly, You must have a Brass Slice to scrape off the Sugar that may\r\nchance to hang upon the side of the hanging Bason.\r\n\r\nThen take care that your Seeds are dry, or dry them well in your hanging\r\nPan.\r\n\r\nTo every quarter of a Pound of Seeds use two Pounds of fine Sugar beaten;\r\nunless to Anise-Seeds, use two Pounds of Sugar to half a Pound of Seeds.\r\n\r\nTo begin the Work, put three Pounds of fine Sugar into the Bason with one\r\nPint of Water, to be stirr'd well together till the Sugar is wet; and boil\r\nit gently, till the Sugar will rope from the Ladle like Turpentine, and it\r\nis enough. Keep this however warm, upon warm Embers, that it may run.\r\nfreely in a ropy Way from the Ladle upon the Seeds.\r\n\r\nWhen this is ready, move the Seeds briskly in the Bason, and fling on them\r\nhalf a ladle-full at a time of the hot Sugar, keeping the Seeds moving for\r\nsome time; which will make them take the Sugar the better, and be sure to\r\ndry them well after every covering, by moving the Bason, and stirring the\r\nComfits. In an Hour, you may make three Pounds of Comfits: you will know\r\nwhen they are coated enough with Sugar, by their becoming as large as you\r\nwould have them. There is no certain Rule, but our own Fancies, for the\r\nSize of them. _Note_, Till they are as you would have them, cast on more\r\nmelted Sugar, as at first, and keep them stirring and shaking in the Pan,\r\ndrying them well after every Coat of Sugar.\r\n\r\nIf you would have ragged or rough Comfits, make your Sugar so liquid, that\r\nit will run from the Ladle; and let it fall upon the Seeds about a Foot and\r\na half high. Let it be very hot, for the hotter it is, the rougher will be\r\nyour Comfits; and for all that, the Comfits will not take so much Sugar as\r\none may imagine from their Appearance. Put on at each time only one\r\nLadle-full, and in ten times repeating it your Comfits will be perfectly\r\nwell coated.\r\n\r\nFor plain Comfits; let not your melted Sugar be too hot at first, nor too\r\nthick; neither pour it on the Seeds too high: but the last two or three\r\nCoverings may be thicker and hotter.\r\n\r\nAs for Coriander-Seeds, which are large, three Pounds of Sugar will only\r\ncover a quarter of a Pound of them.\r\n\r\nWhile your are at work, you should keep your melted Sugar in good Temper,\r\nthat it may not gather into Lumps, or burn to the bottom of the Pan; and to\r\nprevent its growing too thick at any time, put to it a spoonful or two of\r\nWater, gently stirring it now and then with your Ladle, keeping your Fire\r\nvery clear under your Pan. When your Comfits are made, put them upon Papers\r\nin Dishes, and set them before the Fire, or in a declining Oven, which will\r\nmake them look of a Snow white; when they are cool, put them in Boxes, or\r\nin crystal Bottles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Comfits_ of various Colours. From the same.\r\n\r\nIf you would have your Comfits of a red Colour, infuse some red Saunders in\r\nthe Water till it is deep colour'd enough; or else take some Cochineel, and\r\ninfuse it till the Liquor is red enough; or put some Syrup of Mulberries\r\nwith Water to the Sugar.\r\n\r\nIf of a yellow Colour; use Saffron in Water, which you are to mix with the\r\nSugar.\r\n\r\nIf Green; take the Juice of Spinach, and boil it with the Sugar: so will\r\nyour Comfits be of the several Colours above-mention'd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo preserve _Orange_ and _Lemons-Peels_ in Jelly. From the same.\r\n\r\nCut some of the fairest Oranges and Lemons in halves; then scoop out all\r\nthe Pulp and Inside, and boil them in several Waters till they are so\r\ntender, that you may pass a Straw through them; then wash them in cold\r\nWater.\r\n\r\nBoil then the following Preparation: _viz._ The Quantity of a Quart of\r\nWater to every Pound of Peel; and in it some thin Slices of Golden-Pippins,\r\nor Golden Rennets, till the Water becomes slippery. Then to this Water, add\r\nas much Sugar as will boil it to a strong Syrup; then put in your Peels and\r\nscald them, and set them by till the Day following, and boil them again\r\ntill the Syrup will jelly. Then put your Peels into your Glasses, and put\r\ninto your Syrup the Juice of three large Oranges, and one Lemon strain'd,\r\nand boil it till it will make a stiff Jelly, and pour it upon your Peels.\r\nWhen this is quite cold, then put Papers over the Glasses, and keep them in\r\na dry Place.\r\n\r\nYou may also pare the Rinds, in Rings or Slices, and boil them as before;\r\nand in every respect treat them as you are directed to preserve the halves\r\nof Oranges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo preserve _Orange-Flowers_ in Jelly.\r\n\r\nGather your Orange-Flowers, in the Morning early, when they are just open,\r\nand take the Leaves of them. Boil these gently in two or three Waters,\r\npassing them every time through a Sieve: shift the Waters often, to take\r\nout the too great bitterness, but don't boil them too soft, nor to lose\r\ntheir Whiteness. When this is done, make a strong jelly'd Syrup with Water\r\nand fine Sugar, and add some Juice of Lemon or Orange to it; then pour it\r\non the Leaves of the Orange-Flowers; and when it is cold, cover your\r\nGlasses with Paper. _N.B._ You may thicken your Syrup with the Pulp of\r\nPippins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lemon-_Cakes. From Mrs. _Anne Shepperd_ of _Norwich._\r\n\r\nTake out the Pulp of Lemons, as little bruis'd as possible; then boil some\r\nSugar to a candied height, and put to it the Pulp and Juice, and stir it\r\nquickly; then put it into a Stove or into hot Sand. When you observe that\r\nit begins to candy on one side, then turn them out of the Glasses with a\r\nwet Knife on the other side, and let that candy too, in the same manner;\r\nwhen all is done, put them in a Box between Papers, and keep them in a dry\r\nPlace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tripe_ of _Eggs._ From Mr. _Fontaine._\r\n\r\nTake the Whites of Eggs, and beat them very well in a Porringer; prepare\r\nthen some hot Water and Vinegar with a little Salt, and then put in the\r\nEggs, till they are hard; then cut them in pieces about an Inch square, and\r\nthen take some White Wine, and as much Water and some Salt. Put this in a\r\nPan, and heat it over the Fire with a little Parsley, an Onion and some\r\nSpice; when it is hot, serve it up with Butter and Mustard, and it will eat\r\nlike Tripe: or else you may serve it like a Ragoust, with the following\r\nSauce; _viz._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSauce for the Artificial _Tripe_ in _Ragoust._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake strong Gravey made of Beef, and the Ingredients which are mention'd in\r\nthe drawing of Gravey. Warm it with a little White Wine, and thicken the\r\nSauce with burnt Butter: then, when the Eggs are warm'd, pour the Sauce\r\nover them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bacon Froize,_ or _Fraise._ From Mrs. _Bradbury._\r\n\r\nCut fat Bacon in small Pieces, about an Inch long, and then prepare ten or\r\na dozen Eggs well beat; put in a little Milk, some Spice, at pleasure, and\r\nsome Flour; then put some Lard or Seam of an Hog into a Pan, and make it\r\nvery hot; and when it is so, pour in the Mixture, and clap a dish over it,\r\nafter you have thrown some of the Seam upon it. When the Froize is done\r\nenough on one side, turn it with the Dish, and fry it till it is quite\r\nenough. Then serve it with a garnish of sliced Lemons and a little Butter,\r\nfirst letting it drain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clary_ and _Eggs,_ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake eight or ten Eggs; beat them well in a Porringer; then take some Clary\r\nLeaves, and chop them small; add a little Pepper and Salt, and some Onion\r\nchopt small. This Mixture must be fry'd in hot Lard or Hog-Seam, and serve\r\nit with Slices of Lemon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo stew a _Pig._ From the same.\r\n\r\nRoast a Pig till it is hot; then take off the Skin and cut it in pieces;\r\nthen take some White Wine and good Gravey, and stew it with an Onion, some\r\nPepper, Salt, some Nutmeg, a little sweet Marjoram, and some Elder Vinegar,\r\nwith some Butter; and when it is enough, lay it upon Sippits, and garnish\r\nwith sliced Lemon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo stew a _Pig_ another way. From the same.\r\n\r\nRoast a Pig till you can take off the Skin; cut it then in small pieces,\r\nand stew it in White Wine, with a bunch of sweet Herbs, an Onion, some\r\nPepper and Salt, a few Cloves, or a little sweet Marjoram powder'd. When it\r\nis enough, strain off the Liquor it was boil'd in, and in some of that put\r\nsome Mushrooms, and thicken it with Cream, and it will make an excellent\r\nDish. You may garnish it with sliced Lemon and pickled Barberries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make a _Fricassee_ of Sheeps Trotters.\r\n\r\nClean them very well from the Hair; then wash them in Vinegar and Water;\r\nthen take out the Bones, and boil them in Salt and Water with a little\r\nLemon-Peel. When they are hot, give them either of the following Sauces.\r\nFor a white Sauce, take the following: _viz._\r\n\r\nTake some Water, with some Salt, a few sweet Herbs, some whole Pepper, some\r\nLemon-Peel and a bit of Horse-Radish, a Shallot, and a little White Wine.\r\nWhen it is strong enough relish'd, then strain it off, and take a little of\r\nit, and mix it with Butter to thicken it, or Cream would do better, about\r\nhalf a Pint: pour this over the Sheeps Trotters with a few Capers, and\r\nserve it up with Slices of Lemons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA brown _Fricassee_ of Sheeps Trotters.\r\n\r\nDress them as before, and when they are fit for Sauce, then take some Hogs\r\nLard, and make it very hot in a Pan, then put in your Trotters, when they\r\nare well covered with Flour, and when they are done enough, pour over them\r\na Sauce made of Gravey, some Claret and some Mushrooms thickned with burnt\r\nButter. This will make a good brown Fricassee; and serve it up with a\r\ngarnish of Lemon sliced, Barberries pickled, some raspings of Bread lifted,\r\nand toasted before the Fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make a _Lumber-Pye._ From _Exeter._\r\n\r\nTake a Pound of lean Veal, free from Strings, shred it very small, season\r\nit with Cloves and Mace powder'd, some powder of dry'd sweet Herbs, some\r\nLemon-Peel grated, some Pepper and Salt, three large spoonfulls of grated\r\nBread, a little Juice of Lemon, and five or six butter'd Eggs. Mix these\r\nIngredients well together into a Paste or as a farced Meat for Balls about\r\nthe Bigness of small Wallnuts; then take two or three large Veal Sweat\r\nbreads, and cut them in pieces; then provide a Pint of Mushroom Buttons\r\nwell clean'd, and the Yolks of eight hard Eggs cut in halves, a dozen\r\nCoxcombs well scalded and clean'd: lay these with a seasoning of Pepper and\r\nSalt in a good Paste that covers the bottom of your Dish; first laying bits\r\nof Butter on the Paste at the Bottom. Some will put about half a Pound of\r\nCurrans into this Pye; but every one to their Fancy. When your Ingredients\r\nare disposed in your Dish, lay on about four Ounces of Marrow, and the\r\nquantity of six Ounces of Butter, and then close it.\r\n\r\nJust before you set it in the Oven, pour into your Pye half a Pint of\r\nWater; and as soon as you take it out, pour in half a Pint of White Wine\r\nwarm'd, and serve it hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Orange_ or _Lemon_ Tarts. From Mrs. _J. S._\r\n\r\nTake the Rinds of half a score Oranges or Lemons, and salt them four Hours;\r\nthen boil them in four or five Waters till they are tender, and beat them\r\nin a Marble Mortar till they are reduced to a Pulp; then squeeze in the\r\nJuice of as many of the Oranges or Lemons as you think fit, and sweeten the\r\nwhole very well with fine Sugar, and boil it till it is thick, stirring it\r\nwhile it boils, that it may not burn; then let it stand till it is cold,\r\nand put it into your Paste. When you serve it, strew fine Sugar over it.\r\nServe it cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Lemon_ Cheesecakes. From Mrs. _M.N._\r\n\r\nGrate the Rind of a large Lemon, into the Yolks of eight raw Eggs, being\r\nfirst very well beat; then add a quarter of a Pound of fine Sugar well\r\nbeaten and sifted, and four Ounces of fresh Butter; warm these gently over\r\na Fire, keeping it stirring all the while till it begins to thicken; then\r\ntake it off, and put it in the Coffins made of puff Crust, and bake your\r\nCheesecakes in a gentle Oven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Orange_ or _Lemon_ Cheesecakes, another way. From the same.\r\n\r\nTake the Rind of a large Lemon or Orange, and boil it in four or five\r\nWaters till it is quite tender, and free from its Bitterness; then either\r\nshred it or beat it very fine in a Marble Mortar with the Yolks of eight\r\nhard Eggs, six Ounces of Loaf-Sugar finely powder'd, and a spoonfull of\r\nOrange-Flower-Water: mix this then with as much Cream, and two Eggs beat,\r\nas will render it of the Consistence of Cheesecake-meat before it is baked;\r\nthen put it into your Coffins, and bake them in a gentle Oven. You may put\r\nin Currans if you please, but they are generally omitted: however, if you\r\nlike to have them, let them be first plump'd a little over the Fire in\r\nSugar and Water.\r\n\r\nThe best way for these Cheesecakes is to make the Coffins in Patty-Pans,\r\nand fill them with the Meat near an Inch thick.\r\n\r\nThe Proportions mention'd above will serve to direct for a large quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Cheesecakes._ From Lady G.\r\n\r\nTake a Quart of tender Curd, and drain it from the Whey; then break it\r\nsmall; then take a quarter of an Ounce of Mace finely powder'd, and eight\r\nOunces of fine Sugar sifted, eight Yolks of Eggs well beaten, four Ounces\r\nof blanched Almonds beat fine in a Marble Mortar with Rose-Water, or\r\nOrange-Flower-Water, and grate four penny _Naples_ Biscuits into a Pint of\r\nCream, and boil them together over a gentle Fire, stirring it all the while\r\ntill it is as thick as an hasty Pudding; then mix with it eight Ounces of\r\nButter, and put it to the Curd, but not too hot: mix then all well\r\ntogether, and put it in your Paste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA _Sorrel_ Tart. From the same.\r\n\r\nWash some Spinach and Sorrel Leaves in two or three Waters, for they are\r\napt to gather Dirt; then either shred them, and squeeze the Juice out\r\nthrough a Cloth, or else beat them in a Mortar of Marble, and strain off\r\nthe Juice; about half a Pint of Juice will be enough: then shred into it\r\nabout a Quart measure of the same Herbs, and add six Ounces of fine Sugar\r\nbeaten, and some Spice, with the Yolks of six hard Eggs bruised, and well\r\nmix'd with it, and two Eggs raw well beaten; then put in half a Pint of\r\nCream, stirring it well, and put it in a Paste, then bake it in a very\r\ngentle Oven. When it is done, sift on some fine Sugar, and garnish with\r\nOrange and Lemon sliced; you may put in some Orange-Flower-Water, if you\r\nthink convenient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Umble Pye._ From _Mr. Thomas Fletcher_ of _Norwich._\r\n\r\nTake the Umbles of a Deer and boil them tenderly, and when they are cold,\r\nchop them as small as Meat for minc'd Pyes, and shred to them as much\r\nBeef-Suet, six large Apples, half a Pound of Sugar, a Pound of Currans, a\r\nlittle Salt, and as much Cloves, Nutmeg and Pepper powder'd as you see\r\nconvenient; then mix them well together, and when they are put into the\r\nPaste, pour in half a Pint of Sack, the Juice of two Lemons and an Orange:\r\nand when this is done, close the Pye, and when it is baked, serve it hot to\r\nthe Table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Stew Peaches. From the same.\r\n\r\nTake Peaches when they are so ripe that they begin to smell; then pare them\r\nand slit them, and the Sorts I recommend will leave the Stones. Put these\r\nin a Silver Plate, or on such a one as will not communicate any ill taste\r\nto them, and pour over them a Syrup made of Pippins, Water and Sugar boil'd\r\ntill it is a Jelly, and add a little White Wine; then stew them gently over\r\na clear Fire till they are tender; and serve them with fine Sugar sifted\r\nupon them. In some Cafes they pour Cream upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRed _Peach Tarts._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake your Peaches, as before directed, and order them as you did before in\r\nparing them and slitting them; then lay them into the Coffins, and when you\r\nhave sifted on them some fine powder'd Loaf-Sugar, pour over them some\r\nSyrup of Raspberries or Mulberries, and bake them gently: they will be\r\ntender and very highly flavoured, if you put Raspberries to them, and\r\nfinely colour'd; but to have them more of their own Taste, put Syrup of\r\nMulberries to them, and they will be finely colour'd. The Coffins or Crust\r\nought to be made of melting Paste, with fine Sugar in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bitters_ to be drank with Wine.\r\n\r\nTake a Quart of clean Spirit, or good Brandy, and put into it an Ounce of\r\nGentian Root sliced, one Ounce and a half of dry'd Orange-Peel, and one\r\nDrachm of _Virginia_ Snake-Root; add to this half a Drachm of Cochineel,\r\nand half a Drachm of Loaf-Sugar; which last will heighten the Bitter to\r\nadmiration. A little of this Bitter in a Glass of White Wine creates an\r\nAppetite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Stew _Wild-Ducks._ From _Amsterdam._\r\n\r\nWhen your Ducks are ready prepar'd for the Fire, rub their Inside with\r\nPepper, Salt, and a little powder of Cloves, a Shallot or two, with a lump\r\nof Butter in the Belly of each of them; then lay them in an earthen glazed\r\nPan, that will just hold them, and put three Quarters of a Pound of Butter\r\nunder and over your Ducks: then pour in a Pint of Vinegar, and as much\r\nWater with some Salt, Pepper, some Lemon-Peel, some Cloves whole, a bunch\r\nof sweet Herbs, and covering the Pan close, let them stew three or four\r\nHours. Then pass the Liquor through a Sieve, and pour it over your Ducks;\r\nand serve them hot with garnish of Lemon sliced and Raspings of Bread\r\nsifted. This Method serves likewise for Easterlings, Widgeons, Teal and\r\nsuch like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Stew a salted Brisket of _Beef._ From Mr. _La Fontaine._\r\n\r\nTo a Pound of common Salt, put one Ounce of Salt-Petre, and rub your Beef\r\nwell with it, and let it lie a Week; then lard the Skin of it with\r\nBacon-Fat, and lay it in a Stew-pan that will shut close. Cut a Lemon in\r\nhalf with its Rind, and lay a-part on each side the Beef; then put in a\r\nbunch of sweet Herbs, some whole Cloves, half a Nutmeg sliced, some Pepper,\r\nan Onion, or three or four Shallots, half a Pound of Butter, a Pint of\r\nClaret, and a Quart of Water; shut your Pan close, and let it stew gently\r\nfive or six Hours till it is very tender.\r\n\r\nThen having some boil'd Turnip cut in dice, flour them and fry them brown;\r\nthen pour off the Liquor the Beef was stew'd in, and having passed it\r\nthrough a Sieve, thicken it with burnt Butter, and mix your fry'd Turnips\r\nwith it, and pour all together over your Beef; garnish with Lemon sliced,\r\nand Raspings of Bread sifted, and serve it hot, it is an excellent Dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNeck of _Mutton_ ragou'd. From the same.\r\n\r\nTake a Neck of Mutton clean from Bones, and strip it from the Skin; salt it\r\na little, and let it lie till the next day. In the mean while, bake the\r\nBones with a slice or two of fat Bacon, a Faggot of sweet Herbs, some\r\nSpice, a little Salt and some Lemon-Peel, with half a Pint of Water, and\r\nhalf a Pint of Claret, to cover them; then lay your Mutton in a Pan, and\r\nwhen your baked Gravey is passed through a Sieve, pour it into the Pan to\r\nthe Mutton; but first lard the fat Part of the Mutton with Lemon-Peel, and\r\nthe leaner Part with Fat of Bacon; then strew some grated Bread and Spice\r\nover the Mutton, which will not be cover'd with the baked Gravey; and when\r\nyou have closed your Pan, stew it gently four Hours. Then lay it in the\r\nDish, and when you have thickned the Sauce with burnt Butter, put a Pint of\r\nMushroom Buttons, either fresh and parboil'd, or pickled, into it, and toss\r\nthem up till they are hot; then pour them all over your Meat, and serve it\r\nhot, garnish'd with Lemon sliced, red Beet-Roots pickled and sliced,\r\nCapers, and Horse-Radish scrap'd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStew'd _Beef_ in _Soup._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake four Pounds of Beef, indifferently lean, and cut it in eight or ten\r\nPieces. Put these into a Pan that may be close cover'd, and then about\r\nthree Quarts of Water, and a Pint of White Wine, some Pepper and Salt, some\r\nPowder of dry'd sweet Marjoram, a few Cloves powder'd, half a dozen small\r\nTurnips cut in Dice, a Carrot or two cut in the same manner, the white Part\r\nof a large Leek shred small, some Leaves of white Beet, two Heads of\r\nSallery shred, and a Piece of Bread-Crust burnt; cover close, and stew this\r\nfor six Hours, and serve it hot. You may garnish with Lemon sliced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo dress the _Liver_ and _Crow_ of an _Hog._ From Mrs. _Johnson_ in\r\n_Devereux-Court._\r\n\r\nHowever this Dish may seem dispiseable, yet if it is well dresed, few of\r\nthe savoury Dishes exceed it. The Liver and Crow of an Hog, with the\r\nSweet-Breads, should be used presently after the Hog is kill'd, and the\r\nLiver cut in Lumps, twice as big as a Walnut, and not in thin Pieces as\r\nmost do; for then they will become hard in the Dressing. The Crow must\r\nlikewise be cut in Slips about the breadth of two Fingers, and so must the\r\nSweet-Breads; then parboil the Pieces of Liver, and make a thick Batter of\r\nFlour, Water and Eggs, mixing a little Salt with it, and prepare some red\r\nSage shred very fine; some grated Bread, and some Pepper beaten: mix these\r\ntogether, and when you have some Butter, or Lard, very hot in your\r\nFrying-Pan, dip the Crow and Sweet-Bread in the Batter, and immediately dip\r\nyour Pieces in the Mixture of Bread, Sage, _&c._ and throw them into the\r\nPan. When these are enough, lay them to drain before the Fire, and then dip\r\nthe Bits of Liver into the Batter; and after that, into the crumb'd Bread,\r\nand give them a turn or two in the Pan, over a quick Fire: then drain them\r\nlike the others, and serve them hot with Butter and Mustard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sea-Larks_ or _Oysters,_ roasted on Spits or Skewers. From the same.\r\n\r\nTake large Oysters, and wash them from Dirt; then dip them in Batter made\r\nwith Milk, Flour, Powder of Mace, some Eggs and a little Pepper; then dip\r\nthem again in Crumbs of Bread grated, and some Mace powder'd, and put them\r\non a fine Skewer, broad-side to broad-side, or upon Silver Lark Spits; and\r\nwhen they are at the Fire, flour them well, and baste them with Butter till\r\nthey are enough. Prepare for them, while they are Roasting, the following\r\nSauce: Take Crumbs of Bread, a little Pepper and Salt, and a Blade or two\r\nof Mace with a little Nutmeg, and boil them in some of the Oyster-Liquor\r\ntill the Bread is tender and like a Pulp, and tastes well of the Spice;\r\nthen put in a Glass of White Wine, and mix it well, and serve it hot, in a\r\nPlate, with the roasted Oysters over the Sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Shoulder of _Mutton_ or _Lamb,_ roasted with a Farce of _Oysters._ From\r\nMr. _Norman,_ late Cook in _Norfolk._\r\n\r\nTake a Shoulder of Mutton or Lamb, of the smallest size, and slip up the\r\nSkin almost to the Leg-Joint; then cut the Flesh from the Bone, on the\r\nupper side, and mince it very small, take part of that, and as many Oysters\r\nparboil'd without their Fins, and chopt a little; then have some Mace\r\npowder'd, and a little Salt and Pepper, with some grated Lemon-Peel, and\r\nsome grated Bread, with the Yolk of an Egg, or two; and make this into a\r\nPaste, and lay it into the Places where the Flesh was taken out; and you\r\nmay add to this Paste a little Fat of Bacon cut small, or a little Butter.\r\nThen skewer the Skin on all sides, over the Farced Meat, and lard the Skin\r\nand the fleshy Parts below with Lemon-Peel, and some will lard in Lemon\r\nThyme likewise. Then fix it on a Spit with Skewers, and roast it, well\r\nbasted with Butter and well floured. The Sauce for this should be stew'd\r\nOysters, some Mace, stew'd Mushrooms, a little Gravey, and some White-Wine,\r\nwith Crumbs of Bread; then serve it hot, garnish'd with sliced Lemon, and\r\nRed Beet-Root pickled and sliced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStew'd Veal, with white Sauce; from the same.\r\n\r\nTake some Lean of a Leg of Veal, and cut it in thick Slices, then stew them\r\nin Water and a little Salt, with some Mace, and a little Nutmeg, and a\r\nBunch of sweet Herbs. When they are almost stew'd enough with the Gravey in\r\nthem, put to the Liquor they were stew'd in, a Glass or two of White Wine,\r\nand a little Lemon Juice, or Orange Juice, with a little Mushroom Gravey,\r\nor Liquor of stew'd Mushrooms. When this is done, have some Mushroom\r\nButtons, that have been stew'd white in their own Liquor, and Spice, with a\r\nBay-Leaf; then strain the Liquor, and put some in the Sauce: and when it is\r\nhot, put some thick Cream to it, with the Mushrooms; and then serve it hot\r\nwith a Garnish of sliced Lemon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHard _Pease-Soup._ From the same.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways of making Pease-Soup. In great Families it is sometimes\r\nmade of Beef, but a Leg of Pork is much preferable; and in smaller Families\r\nthe Bones of Pork, as they are called. And the Shin and Hock of a Leg of\r\nPork, after they have made Sausages, may be had at the Sausage-Houses:\r\nthese boil'd for a long time, will afford a strong Jelly Broth, but they\r\nare hard to be met with. However, when they are to be had, you have the\r\nDirections for a Broth. Then pass the Broth, hot, through a Sieve, and put\r\ninto it half a Pint of slit Pease to a Quart of Liquor; or a Quart of whole\r\nPease to three Quarts of Liquor. The Difference between one and the other,\r\nis, the slit Pease will open in the Liquor, when we boil it, and the other\r\nought to be broken through a Cullender, when they are boil'd: but the slit\r\nPease are the best; and when you put them into the Liquor to boil, add to\r\nevery Quart of Liquor as much Sallery as you think proper, cut small; some\r\npowder of dry'd Mint, some powder of dry'd sweet Marjoram, some Pepper, and\r\nsome Salt, to your mind, and let these boil till the Sallery is tender.\r\nThis is to be done, if we boil a Leg of Pork, after the Pork is out of the\r\nPot; but if we make the Soup from the Bones, boil these Ingredients\r\nafterwards in the Liquor. When you serve it, put a _French_ Role in the\r\nmiddle of the Dish, and garnish the Border of the Dish with rasp'd Bread\r\nsifted. Some put in All-spice powder'd, which is very agreeable: and one\r\nmight add the Leaves of white Beets, And in serving, put in toasted Bread,\r\ncut in Dice; but the last is out of fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make green _Pease-_Pottage, with _Milk._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake a Quart of green Pease shell'd, and boil three Quarts or two Quarts of\r\nMilk, as you please to have them thick with Pease; and add some Pepper\r\nlargely beaten, a little Salt, some dry'd Mint, and sweet Marjoram in\r\npowder, and a little whole Spice beaten. Boil these together till the Cream\r\nrises, and then stir it, and serve it hot. _N.B._ The Pease should be\r\nboil'd first, if there is any opportunity; and for that Reason, if when we\r\nhave a Dish of Pease, we leave any, they may be put into the Milk, and\r\nboil'd the Morning following; and indeed it is the best to have the Pease\r\nboil'd first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make an artificial _Crab_ or _Lobster._ From Mr. _F._ of _Buckingham._\r\n\r\nI Suppose you have by you the large Shells of Sea-Crabs clean'd; then take\r\npart of a Calf's Liver, boil it and mince it very small, and a little\r\nAnchovy Liquor, and but very little, to give it the Fish-taste. Mix it well\r\nwith a little Lemon Juice, some Pepper, and some Salt, with a little Oil,\r\nif you like it, and fill the Shells with it; and then the outside Parts of\r\nthe Liver, being a little hard, will feel to the Mouth like the Claws of\r\nthe Crab broken and pick'd, and the inner Parts will be soft and tender,\r\nlike the Body of a Crab. One may serve this cold, and it will deceive a\r\ngood Judge, if you do not put too much of the Anchovy Liquor into it. It is\r\nvery good cold; but if you would have it hot, take the following Receipt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make artificial hot butter'd _Sea-Crabs._\r\n\r\nHave the great Shells of Crabs clean, and prepare some Liver, as before; or\r\nit you cannot get Calf's Liver, get a Lamb's Liver, or a young Sheep's\r\nLiver will do tolerably well. Boil these, and shred them as directed\r\nbefore, and put a little Anchovy Liquor to them; then add a little White\r\nWine, some Pepper and Salt at pleasure, and some other Spice at discretion,\r\nwith Butter necessary to make it mellow, over a gentle Fire, or a little\r\nSallet Oil, if you like Oil. Then add a little Lemon Juice in the Shells,\r\nstirring the Mixture together. Then serve them up hot with Lemon sliced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make artificial _Crabs._ From M. _De la Port_ of _Lyons_ in _France._\r\n\r\nTake some of the White of a roasted or boil'd Chicken's Breast, and shred\r\nit very small; then add some Roots of Potatoes boil'd and beat into Pulp.\r\nMix these together, and grate a little Lemon-Peel upon it, and add a little\r\nAnchovy Liquor to it, with some Oil; and put a little Lemon-juice to it, or\r\nVinegar, with some Pepper and Salt, serve it upon Sippits, garnish'd with\r\nsliced Lemon. These may be butter'd in Shells as the Former, but the first\r\nis rather the best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make artificial _Lobsters._ From the same.\r\n\r\nPractise the same Method with either of the former; and to imitate the Tail\r\nof the Lobster, put in the Tails of Shrimps, Buntings, Prawns or Cray-fish;\r\nthe last cut in pieces, and serve them either upon Sippets in a Plate, or\r\nin the large Shell of the Lobster.\r\n\r\n_N.B._ This is a sort of Salmy, or Salmy-Gundy, as they call it in\r\n_England;_ but is very much like the Thing we want: and I think, if the\r\nShrimps, or others, were put into the first, it would make it better than\r\nputting in the Anchovy Liquor; but if they are to imitate a Crab, they\r\nmust, (_i.e._ the Shrimps or Prawns) be chopt very small.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo imitate _Cherry-Brandy,_ without _Cherries,_ very Good.\r\n\r\nTake a clean Spirit, or some good _French_ Brandy, one Gallon, and infuse\r\nin it the Tops of Laurel, one good handfull till it tastes like the Kernels\r\nof Cherries; then put in a quantity of Mulberry Syrup, enough to colour it,\r\nand make it pleasant to the Taste. A good Judge will not find the\r\ndifference between the Right and the Wrong. _N.B._ When the Brandy is\r\nstrong enough of the Laurel-Buds, pour it off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Cherry Brandy._ From Mr. _Cent-Livre._\r\n\r\nTake black Cherries, when they are at the cheapest, and pulling them from\r\nthe Stalks, put them into a Cask of Brandy, a Pound to each Quart of\r\nBrandy, and one Pound of fine Sugar to each Gallon. Let it stand for some\r\ntime, and draw it off. It will be very rich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Ratafia._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake the Kernels of Apricots, to do it in the highest way, about one\r\nhundred and fifty, and bruise them a little; then put them into three or\r\nfour Quarts of Brandy, and let them steep four or five Days: then strain\r\nthem off, and add as much fine Sugar powder'd, as will make it sweet to\r\nyour Taste. If you find that the Brandy is too strong of the Kernels, put\r\nsome more Brandy to it before you sweeten it.\r\n\r\n_Memorandum,_ If you cannot get Apricot or Peach-Stones, enough for your\r\nuse, you may use the Kernels of Plum-Stones, Cherry-Stones, or Prunes, and\r\nthey will make little difference, in great quantities. Break the Shells,\r\nand put in Shells and all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_To make Artificial_ Ratafia.\r\n\r\nTo a Gallon of Spirits or Brandy, put in two handfuls of the Buds of young\r\nLaurel-Branches; infuse this till the Liquor is of a taste as you would\r\nhave it: then pour off the Liquor, and sweeten it to your Fancy with fine\r\nSugar powder'd. This is a way that a Distiller, who is dead, practised a\r\nlong while, as well as the making of Gin, or Geneva Brandy, with infusing\r\nthe Tops of the Juniper Plant in common Spirits. These I told him of, and\r\nit is now at my own disposal, and therefore give it to the World. The\r\nRatafia tastes exactly as if the Kernels of Apricot or Plum-Stones had been\r\nused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Salmy,_ or with us _Salmy-Gundy._ From Lady _M._\r\n\r\nTake the Breast of a Turkey, a Chicken, or the Lean of some Veal that has\r\nbeen roasted rather than boil'd; but if that happens, it will still do. But\r\nhowever it is, take none of the Skin, nor any Fat. Mince this very small\r\nabout half a Pound, and then take off the Skin of a pickled Herring, and\r\nmince the Flesh of it very small, or for want of that, cut the Flesh of\r\nsome Anchovys very small; then cut a large Onion small, an Apple or two as\r\nsmall as the rest. Mix these Meats together and laying them in little\r\nHeaps, three on a Plate, let some whole Anchovys curl'd or upright, in the\r\nMiddle, and garnish with sliced Lemon, Capers and other Pickles, with red\r\nBeet-Roots pickled and sliced. This to be served cold; and when you eat it,\r\nuse Oil, Vinegar, and a little Mustard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo serve up pickled _Herrings._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake large pickled Herrings, take off the Skin; then take the Flesh from\r\nthe Bones, on each side, all in one piece, crossing them every half-inch.\r\nThen lay the Parts next the Head, in the middle of the Plate, spreading\r\ntheir Bodies to the outside, like a Star, garnishing them with the Roots of\r\nred Beets sliced, Lemon sliced, and Berberries pickled. This is commonly\r\neaten with Vinegar, and Bread and Butter, but Onion and Pepper is sometimes\r\nused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marmalade_ of _Peaches._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake Peaches, well grown and almost ripe; pare them, and take their Flesh\r\nclean from the Stones. Lay them with a little Water into a Stew-Pan, and\r\nadd three Quarters of their weight of fine Sugar powder'd. Let this stew\r\ntill the Peaches are tender, and then mash them with a Spoon, letting them\r\nboil gently all the while, till the Whole becomes thick, almost like a\r\nPaste; then take it out, and cool it in a _China_ Dish, or earthen glazed\r\nPan; and when it is cold, put it into Glasses, and cover them over with\r\nwhite Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite _Peach-_Tarts. From the same.\r\n\r\nMake some Coffins of sweet Paste, and when they are gently baked, and cold,\r\nfill them with the above-mention'd Marmalade of Peaches, and serve them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Apricots_ preserv'd for Tarts. From the same.\r\n\r\nTake Apricots of the largest kind, When they begin to turn to Ripeness,\r\npare them and discharge them from the Stones. Cut them in Halves, and stew\r\nthem with a little Water, and their weight of fine Sugar powder'd. Boil\r\nthese gently over a clear Charcoal Fire, till the Liquor becomes of the\r\nConsistence of a Jelly, and the Apricots are clear. Then when they are\r\ncool, put them up in glazed Gallypots, or in Glasses. If you use them for\r\nTarts, put them in Coffins of sweet Paste, and cover them, and put them in\r\nthe Oven, till they are hot through. Then serve them with double-refined\r\nSugar grated over them. These may be either serv'd hot or cold. The Jelly\r\nof this kind, in the Glasses, may be serv'd as a Sweetmeat in a Desert.\r\n\r\n_Memorandum,_ If, when these Fruits are ripe, you can have any Apples near\r\nripe, pare them, and slice them free from the Core, and stew them in as\r\nmuch Water as will cover them, and their weight in fine Sugar, till by\r\nboiling and stirring, the whole becomes of a Jelly; then in this, when it\r\nis clear, stew your Apricots, or Peaches, till they are what you desire.\r\n_N.B._ You may always colour these with Syrup of Mulberries, which gives no\r\nadditional Taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlums to make _Marmalade _of. From the same.\r\n\r\nThere are several sorts of Plums, which are fit for this use. And though\r\nthey differ in colour, that is, some red and some white, yet the Marmalade\r\nmade of any of them will be white, for the Colour is only in the Skin; and\r\nthat if it was to be used, could give no Tincture; but in our Case, we do\r\nnot want it. The Sorts are either the _Bonum Magnum_, as it is call'd,\r\nwhich is a large, long, red Plum, with a Pulp very tender, but sour, when\r\nit is raw from the Tree. Another is a large Plum, rather yellowish than\r\nwhite, when it is ripe, and of the former Shape, like an Egg, which is\r\ncalled by some the Egg-Plum; but more particularly the white _Holland_\r\nPlum, and is so called by the Gardeners. These two have a Flesh and Juice\r\nmuch like one another, and make a fine Shew in a Dish by way of Desert; but\r\nare in my Opinion only fit for stewing. However, the Skins will part easily\r\nfrom 'em, when they are ripe, and they both quit the Stone freely. Take\r\nthese and peel them, and divide them; then put them in a little Water and\r\ntheir weight of fine Sugar, made into a Syrup, over a gentle Fire: put them\r\nin when the Liquor is only warm, and when they are cover'd with the Syrup,\r\nstew them gently, if you would preserve them in their Shape; and put them,\r\nwith the Syrup, into Glasses as soon as they are clear, or else mash them\r\ninto the Syrup, and let them boil till they become like a Paste; keeping\r\nall stirring while they are over the Fire, or else they will burn to the\r\nPan. This Marmalade is good to be serv'd in Glasses as a Sweet-meat in a\r\nDesert, or to be put into Coffins for Tarts, or to be brought upon the\r\nTable in Saucers among the other Sweet-meats in a Desert.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo stew _Cucumbers._ From the _Devil-_Tavern, _Fleet-street._\r\n\r\nTake a dozen large green Cucumbers, that are not too full of Seed; pare\r\nthem, and slice them; then take two large Onions, and shred them\r\nindifferently small. Put these in a Sauce-Pan, and set them over the Fire\r\nto stew, with as much Salt as you think convenient; stir them now and then,\r\ntill they are tender, and then pour them into a Cullender to drain from the\r\nWater, and are as dry as possible you can make them; then flour them, and\r\nput some Pepper to them. After this, burn some Butter in a Frying-Pan; and\r\nwhen it is very hot, put in your Cucumbers, and stir them continually till\r\nthey are brown; then put to them about a Gill of Claret; and when that is\r\nwell mix'd with them, serve them hot, under roast Mutton or Lamb; or else,\r\nserve them on a Plate, upon Sippits fry'd and dip'd in Mutton or Beef\r\nGravey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Farce _Cucumbers._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake large Cucumbers and pare them, then scoop out all the Seeds, first\r\ncutting off one End, then prepare the following Farce for them. Take the\r\nHearts of some Cabbage-Lettuce stew'd tender in Salt and Water, drain them\r\nwell, and chop them small, and cut some Onion very fine, shred a little\r\nParsley that has been boil'd tender, and a Mushroom pickled; and add a\r\nlittle All-Spice finely powder'd, and some Pepper, a little Salt, and some\r\nFat of Bacon chopt small. Mix these well together, with the Yolk of an Egg\r\nor two, according to your Quantity, and stuff the Cucumbers full of it.\r\nThen tie the Ends, that were cut off close, with Packthread, and stew them\r\nin Water and Salt till they are tender; then drain them and flour them, and\r\nfry them brown in Hogs-Lard very hot, and let them drain; then take off the\r\nThreads that hold them together, and lay them in your Dish, and pour the\r\nfollowing Sauce over them: _viz._ Take Gravey well season'd, and as much\r\nClaret; boil these together, with some Lemon-Peel, and All-Spice; and\r\nthicken this Sauce with burnt Butter. These are good to be serv'd with\r\nMutton Cutlets, as well as alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make a _Shropshire_ Pye.\r\n\r\nTake a couple of Rabbits, and cut them in pieces; season them well with\r\nPepper and Salt; then cut some pieces of fat Pork, and season them in like\r\nmanner. Lay these into your Crust, with some pieces of Butter, upon the\r\nbottom Crust, and close your Pye. Then pour in half a Pint of Water, and\r\nred Wine mixt, and bake it. Some will grate the best part of a Nutmeg upon\r\nthe Meat, before they close the Pye, which is a very good way. This must be\r\nserv'd hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make a _Shropshire_ Pye, another way. From Lady _H._\r\n\r\nTake Rabbits and Pork, cut and season'd as above; then make a Farce of the\r\nRabbits Livers parboil'd, and shred small; some fat Bacon shred small, some\r\nsweet Marjoram powder'd, some Pepper and Salt, and made into a Paste, with\r\nthe Yolks of Eggs beaten; and then make this into Balls, and lay them in\r\nyour Pye, amongst the Meat, at proper Distances. Then take the Bottoms of\r\nthree or four Artichokes boil'd tender, and cut in Dice; and lay these\r\nlikewise amongst the Meat. Put in also some Coxcombs blanch'd; then close\r\nyour Pye, and pour in as much Wine and Water as you think convenient. Bake\r\nit, and serve it hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make artificial _Coxcombs._ From Mr. _Renaud._\r\n\r\nTake Tripe, without any Fat, and with a sharp Knife pare away the fleshy\r\npart, leaving only the brawny or horny part about the thickness of a Cock's\r\nComb. Then, with a Jagging-Iron, cut Pieces out of it, in the shape of\r\nCocks Combs, and the remaining Parts between, may be cut to pieces, and\r\nused in Pyes, and serve every whit as well as Cocks Combs: but those cut in\r\nform, please the Eye best; and, as Mr. _Renaud_ observes, the Eye must be\r\npleased, before we can taste any thing with Pleasure. And therefore, in\r\nFricassees we should put those which are cut according to Art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calf's_ Liver stuffed and roasted. From the same.\r\n\r\nTake a Calf's Liver, the Morning it is kill'd, and make a hole in it, with\r\na large Knife, to run length-ways, but not quite through it; then make a\r\nfarced Meat, or stuffing for it, of some of the Liver parboil'd, and some\r\nFat of Bacon cut very fine, some fresh Lemon-Peel grated, some sweet Herbs\r\npowder'd, and some butter'd Eggs, as much as may be necessary, to mix with\r\nthe other Ingredients; then add some grated Bread, and some Spices finely\r\nbeat, with some Pepper and Salt: then fill that part that you cut in the\r\nLiver with this farced Meat; and cut other Places if you will, and fill\r\nthem likewise. You may then lard the Liver, if you will, with Bacon Fat,\r\nand roast it, flouring it very well, and basting it with Butter, till it is\r\nenough. But it is reckon'd rather better by some, when the Liver is\r\nstuffed, to brush it over with the Yolk of an Egg, and strew upon it\r\nraspings of Bread sifted, some Flour, some dry'd sweet Herbs powder'd, and\r\nsome Spice; and then enclose the Whole with the Caul of Veal; so roast it,\r\nand it will make an excellent Dish. To be served hot, either with Venison\r\nSauce, made of Claret boil'd with Cinnamon, and sweeten'd with Sugar, or\r\nwith Gravey Sauce, with a little Wine in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo roast a _Calf's_ Liver, another way. From Mrs. _M. N._\r\n\r\nTake a Calf's Liver, as before, and stuff it as above, only with this\r\nAlteration in the Stuffing. Shred some Veal-Suet very small, and add to\r\nthat some grated Bread, Spice, and dry'd sweet Herbs finely powder'd, with\r\nsome Currans plump'd, and a little Salt; then make this into a Paste, with\r\nsome Eggs beaten; and when you have stuffed what Parts you please, with the\r\nMixture, roast it, basting it well with Butter, and strewing on, now and\r\nthen, some of the above Mixture, as far as it can be in powder, or admit of\r\nstrewing. Then serve it hot, with melted Butter and Lemon-Juice, or\r\nVerjuice, and garnish with Lemon sliced, and pickled Berberries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCream Custard. From Lady _H._\r\n\r\nBoil a Quart of Cream, with some grated Nutmeg, and a little Mace finely\r\npowder'd; then beat the Yolks of twelve Eggs, with half as many Whites,\r\nwith a little Salt: then add a spoonfull of Sack, and one of Orange-Flower\r\nWater, or Rose-Water: then put about six Ounces of fine Loaf-Sugar beaten\r\nfine, and well sifted; and mix all together, when the Cream is not too hot;\r\nthen pass it through a fine Sieve, and bake it in _China_ Cups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo imitate the fat Livers of _Capons_ roasted. From the same.\r\n\r\nTake a Calf's Liver fresh, and cut it in pieces, in the shape of large\r\nCapons Livers. Dip every one in Flour, and spit them on Lark-Spits, the\r\nflat Sides against each other, but minding to put between them a slice of\r\nfat Bacon. Roast them, and baste them well with Butter, and drudging them\r\noften with rasped Bread sifted, and flour with a little Salt. When they are\r\nenough, serve them with the following Sauce. Take two or three Necks of\r\nFowls, if you have them, or else, a little clean Beef Gravey, a little\r\nWater, a little Ale, or small Beer; an Onion and some Pepper and Salt: then\r\nstrain off the Sauce, and pour it into the Dish before you lay in your\r\nLivers, and garnish with Slices of Lemon, sliced Beet-Roots pickled, and\r\nsifted raspings of Bread. These do well likewise to be laid about a roasted\r\nChicken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Pound Cakes._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake a Pound of double refined Loaf-Sugar beaten and sifted; then beat\r\neight Eggs and stir the Sugar in them; then melt a Pound of Butter, and\r\nstir that in with the rest, and then stir in a Pound of Flour, some Mace\r\nfinely beat, with some Nutmeg grated, and some Sack, and Orange-Flower\r\nWater; beat these all together for an hour and a half till all is well\r\nmix'd; then stir in some Currans plump'd a little. To make good the name of\r\nthe Cake, there should be a Pound of a sort. Some put about a quarter of a\r\nPound of Caraway Comfits; but every way is good. Bake these in little Pans,\r\nin, a gentle Oven, and when they are quite cold, turn them out, and keep\r\nthem in oaken Boxes, with Papers between them, in a dry Place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make a Six Hour Pudding. From the same.\r\n\r\nTake a Pound of Beef Suet, pick'd clean from the Skins and bloody Parts,\r\nand chop it pretty small; then take a Pound of Raisins of the Sun, and\r\nstone them; then shred them, and mix them together: add to them a large\r\nspoonfull of Flour, and six Eggs beaten, a little _Lisbon_ Sugar, some\r\nSalt, and some Cloves, and Mace, beaten. Then mix these well together, and\r\nmake two Puddings of them, tied up in Cloths well flour'd; boil them six\r\nHours, and serve them with Sugar and Butter in Cups. This will cut very\r\nfirm, and not taste at all greasy. And if you save one cold, cut it in\r\nSlices, and lay it upon a Grid-Iron, under Beef while it is roasting, and\r\nit eats very well with Beef Gravey hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make a _Venison_ Pasty. From the same.\r\n\r\nTake six Pounds of Cambridge potted Butter, and rub it into a peck of\r\nFlour, but do not rub in your Butter too small; and then make it into a\r\nPaste, with Water: then butter your Pan well, and when your Paste is roll'd\r\nout thick, lay it in the Pan, preserving only enough for the Lid. The\r\n_Cambridge_ Butter is mention'd, because it is a little Salt; or else, if\r\nyou use fresh Butter, there should be some Salt put into the Crust. When\r\nthat is prepar'd, take a side of Venison, and take off the Skin, as close\r\nas can be, and take the Bones out quite free from the Flesh; then cut this\r\nthrough length-ways, and cut it cross again, to make four Pieces of it;\r\nthen strew these Pieces with Pepper and Salt, well mix'd, at discretion:\r\nand after having laid a little of the Pepper and Salt at the bottom of the\r\nPasty, with some pieces of Butter; then lay in your pieces of Venison, so\r\nthat at each Corner the Fat may be placed; then lay some Butter over it, in\r\npieces, and close your Pasty. When it is ready for the Oven, pour in about\r\na Quart of Water, and let it bake from five a Clock in the Morning till one\r\nin the Afternoon, in a hot Oven. And at the same time put the Skin and the\r\nBones broken, with Water enough to cover them, and some Pepper and Salt\r\ninto a glaz'd earthen Pan, into the same Oven; and when you draw the Pasty,\r\npour off as much as you think proper, of the clear Liquor, into your Pasty.\r\nServe it hot, but it is properly a side-board Dish, and the Carver ought\r\nalways to take the Services, of the Pasty, from the Corners where the Fat\r\nis, to do honour to the Master and his Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo roast a _Hog's_ Harslet. From the same.\r\n\r\nTake a Hog's Harslet, as soon as the Hog is kill'd, lay aside the Lights,\r\nand cut the Liver in thick Slices, and the Heart in thinner Pieces; then\r\ntake some of the Crow of an Hog, and cut that in Pieces equal with the\r\nrest. Then take the Sweetbreads, with some of the Sticking-Pieces, as they\r\nare called, and some Slices of fat Bacon. Dip these into Eggs beaten, and\r\nthen dip them again into grated Bread, some red Sage chopt small, and some\r\nPepper and Salt, with a little sweet Marjoram, or sweet Basil powder'd;\r\nthen put the Pieces, broad-side one to another, upon a small Spit, always\r\nobserving to put the Bacon next the Heart, and the Crow next the Liver;\r\nthen wrap them up in a Cawl of Veal, and roast it. Put these Pieces as\r\nclose as you can together, and when it is done, serve it with some melted\r\nButter and Mustard, with a little Lemon-Juice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Cream of _Raspberries._ From Mrs. _Heron._\r\n\r\nTake thick Cream, a Quart, and put to that, either some Raspberry Syrup, or\r\nsome Jamm of Raspberries; but the Syrup will mix much easier with it:\r\nhowever, the Jamm of Raspberries is accounted the best by some, because\r\nthat has the Seeds in it. But I think, that Syrup of Raspberries is better,\r\nbecause all is smooth, and the Cream tastes sufficiently of the\r\nRaspberries. One must serve this with the Desert. But if you use the Jamm\r\nof Raspberries, you must beat it with some of the Cream a good while before\r\nit will mix; and then put it to the other Cream, and stir it a little, and\r\nit will mix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArtificial Cream, to be mix'd with any Preserves of Fruit. From Mrs. _M.\r\nS._ of _Salisbury._\r\n\r\nTake a Quart of Milk, and when it is boil'd, put in the Yolks of eight Eggs\r\nwell beaten with the Whites of six. Put not in the Eggs while the Milk is\r\ntoo hot, lest they curdle. Then, when they are well mix'd, set them over a\r\ngentle Fire, and stir them all the while; and when you perceive them to be\r\nthick enough, put into them what quantity you please of Syrup, or Jamms of\r\nApricots, Peaches, or Plums, or Cherries, or Oranges, Lemons, or other\r\nFruits, stirring them well till they partake enough of the preserv'd\r\nFruit's taste, and then serve them up, in _China_ Basons, cold, in a\r\nDesert, without any Ornament of Flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Sweet-meat _Cream._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake either clean Cream from the Dairy, or else make the foregoing\r\nartificial Cream, and slice preserv'd Apricots, or preserv'd Peaches or\r\nPlums, into it, having first sweeten'd the Cream well, with fine Loaf\r\nSugar, or with the same Syrup they were preserv'd in. Mix these well, and\r\nserve them separately, cold, in _China_ Basons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo embalm _Pidgeons._ From a Lady in _Suffolk._\r\n\r\nThis Receipt was communicated in this manner: _viz._ Sir, I have seen the\r\nMethod you propose to embalm Partridges, in your _Farmer's Monthly\r\nDirector,_ and have tried it so far, that I have kept them, done that way,\r\na Month. I had then a mind to try what I could do with Pidgeons; and as\r\nsoon as they were kill'd, I was diligent to take out all the Blood, and\r\nwash them, and dry them, as is directed, with warm Cloths, both inside and\r\noutside. I then laid them in Pans of earthen Ware, and cover'd them with\r\nmelted Butter, which kept them very well, for a long time. I wash'd the\r\nNecks of the Pidgeons, when the Crops were taken out, with Vinegar, and\r\ndry'd them. Then I used them as you direct for Partridges, and they kept\r\nsweet a Month, fit for Roasting; and they eat the same as if they were\r\nfresh kill'd. This I send you word of, because you may know how far your\r\nembalming of Partridges has taken Effect, and to tell you, the Lady who\r\ntold you of it, understood very well what she did. As for my part, I used\r\nfresh Butter; but you did not say whether it should be salt or fresh, and I\r\ntry'd Pidgeons, because they are Fowls which decay sooner than any. If you\r\nthink this worth your Notice,\r\n\r\n\r\n  _I am,\r\n    Your humble Servant._\r\n      S. F.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo preserve _Pidgeons_ another way. From the same.\r\n\r\nTake Pidgeons fresh kill'd; wash them from the Blood, and take off the\r\nFlesh, as clean as you can from the Bones, and discharge all the Inside:\r\nthen season them well with Pepper and Salt, with a little Mace and Nutmeg\r\ngrated, and boil them in equal quantities of Vinegar and Water, till they\r\nare very tender with Cloves, or other Spice, as you like, and if you add a\r\nBay-leaf or two it will be better. When your Pidgeons are boil'd tender\r\nenough, take them from the Fire, and when the Liquor is cold, lay your\r\nPidgeons in a large Gally-pot, and pour the Liquor upon them, and cover\r\nthem up close with Leather, and they will keep a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Attempt to preserve _Cucumbers,_ for Stewing, in the Winter. From the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYou have often told me, that you was a Lover of Cucumbers, and more\r\nespecially stew'd, than any other way; which I find many others of my\r\nFriends come into. I propose, that you should pare and slice Cucumbers as\r\nusual for stewing; and then with a little Salt and Pepper, with their own\r\nLiquor stew them in a Sauce-Pan till they are a little tender; then pour\r\nthem into a Cullendar, and when they are drain'd well from the Liquor, boil\r\nsome White Wine, with Water, half one, and half the other, with whole\r\nPepper; and when the Liquor is cold, put the Cucumbers into a Gally-pot,\r\nand pour the Liquor over them: and, if you put a little Oil upon the\r\nLiquor, I am persuaded they will keep several Months. I wish it may be\r\ntry'd, for I have thought of it; and according to my Judgment it may be fit\r\nto use, any time in the Winter, for stewing.\r\n\r\nWhen you use these, pour away all the Liquor, and let them pass through a\r\nSaucepan with a little Salt and Water, till they are tender, as you would\r\nhave them; then drain them again in a Cullendar, and fry them brown, with\r\nburnt Butter, first flouring them, and a little Pepper; and when they are\r\nenough, put in a Glass of Claret, or a Glass of White Wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _I am,\r\n    Your humble Servant._\r\n      S. F.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pippin_ Tart. From the same.\r\n\r\nCut some golden Pippins in halves, pare them, and take out the Cores; then\r\nstew them with half their weight of Sugar, and some Lemon-Peel, cut in thin\r\nlong Slices, and Water enough to cover them. When they are clear, they are\r\nenough; then set them by to cool, and strain off the Liquor, or Syrup, and\r\nput that in a Pan to stew gently, with some candy'd Lemon and Orange-Peel,\r\nin slices; then have a sweet Paste prepared in a Dish, and lay in your\r\nPippins, and pour the Syrup, and Sweetmeats, over them, and bake them in a\r\ngentle Oven; and when it is hot, pour some Cream either pure or artificial\r\nover them, and serve them to the Table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Pickle _Marygold-Flowers._ From Mr. _T._ of _Buckingham._\r\n\r\nThough the Marygold Flower is of old date in Pottage; yet it continues\r\nstill its stand among the useful things of the Kitchen, and cannot more\r\neasily be worn out, according to the custom of the Country, when the\r\nCountry Folks make Broth. Mint with Pease, Fennel with Mackarel, and such\r\nlike, cannot be forgot. And as the Marygold-Flowers are used in Porridge, I\r\nsend the Receipt how to pickle them. Strip the Flower-leaves off, when you\r\nhave gather'd the Flowers, at Noon, or in the Heat of the Day, and boil\r\nsome Salt and Water; and when that is cold, put your Marygold-Flower Leaves\r\nin a Gallypot, and pour the Salt and Water upon them; then shut them up\r\nclose till you use them, and they will be of a fine Colour, and much fitter\r\nfor Porridge than those that are dry'd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeed-Cake. From the same.\r\n\r\nMake some Paste of fine Flour, such as you would make for light Bread, with\r\nYeast. Take five Pounds of this Dough, Without Salt in it, and cover it\r\nbefore a Fire for half an Hour, to make it rise; then take two Pounds and a\r\nhalf of fresh Butter melted, and five Eggs beaten well with half a Pound of\r\nfine _Lisbon_ Sugar. Mix these well with your Paste, and work it till it is\r\nas light as possible; and when your Oven is very hot and clean, strew into\r\nyour Cake a Pound of smooth Caraway Comfits; then put some Butter on the\r\nSides and Bottom of your Pan, and put in your Cake, and one Hour and a\r\nquarter will bake it. When it comes out of the Oven, cover it with Cloths\r\nof Linnen till it is cold; then put it, the next Day, a little while into\r\nan Oven. _N.B._ You must be sure to put in the Sugar after the Butter. One\r\nmay put on an Iceing if one will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Orange-Chips. From the same.\r\n\r\nTake some fresh Oranges about _February,_ and pare them very thin; they are\r\nthen very cheap. Boil them in several Waters till they are tender, and have\r\nlost their Bitterness; then put them into cold Water for twelve Hours or\r\nmore. Then make a Syrup for them in the following manner. Take about their\r\nweight of fine Sugar powder'd, and mix it with as much Water as it will\r\ntake in, or a little more. Boil this, and scum it well; then drain the\r\nOrange-Peels from the Water they were steep'd in, and put them in a glaz'd\r\nearthen Vessel, and then pour the boiling hot Syrup upon them, letting them\r\nremain so till the Day following; then pour the Syrup from them, and boil\r\nit afresh, and pour it on a second time, and repeat the same work till your\r\nPeels are very clear, and the Syrup very thick; and then dry them in a\r\nStove, and they will be fit for use, in the Condition we buy them. One may\r\ncandy Lemon-Chips after the same manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Hartshorn-Jelly._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake six Ounces of Harts-horn Shavings; put them into two Quarts of Water,\r\nand two or three bits of Lemon-Peel, and set this in a Sand-heat, for six\r\nor eight Hours, or let them infuse about ten Hours upon hot Embers. Then\r\nboil it briskly, and when you find it will jelly, as you may do, by taking\r\nout a little of the Liquor in a Spoon, and cooling it; then strain it off,\r\nand add to it about half a Pound of double-refined Sugar powder'd very\r\nfine; about a Gill of Sack, or two or three spoonfuls of Mountain Wine, the\r\nJuice of two Lemons; then set this on a slow Fire, and as it heats, beat\r\nthe Whites of two Eggs to a froth, and put it into the Pan, where the Jelly\r\nis, at times as it rises; and then, when it just boils up, take it from the\r\nFire, and it will be clarified. Then pour it by small quantities into the\r\nJelly-bag, and let it drop or run into some Receiver; but it will be apt to\r\nrun thick at first: then take that which is first run, if it be thick, and\r\npour again into the Jelly-bag, and you will find it come clear. Then place\r\nyour Glasses to receive it, and change the full one for another, which you\r\nmust carefully watch, that your Glasses be not soil'd in the least, for the\r\nBeauty of this, in one particular, is its transparency; and again, it\r\nshould not be too stiff. Some only take the Harts-horn Shavings, six Ounces\r\nto two Quarts of Water, and boil it gently till the Liquor will jelly,\r\nwithout the expence of a Sand-heat, or setting it on hot Embers. The\r\nboiling it is the best way, but requires more Patience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make a Tart of the _Ananas,_ or _Pine-Apple._ From Barbadoes.\r\n\r\nTake a Pine-Apple, and twist off its Crown: then pare it free from the\r\nKnots, and cut it in Slices about half an Inch thick; then stew it with a\r\nlittle Canary Wine, or Madera Wine, and some Sugar, till it is thoroughly\r\nhot, and it will distribute its Flavour to the Wine much better than any\r\nthing we can add to it. When it is as one would have it, take it from the\r\nFire; and when it is cool, put it into a sweet Paste, with its Liquor, and\r\nbake it gently, a little while, and when it comes from the Oven, pour Cream\r\nover it, (if you have it) and serve it either hot or cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marmalade_ of _Pine-Apples,_ or _Ananas._\r\n\r\nWhen you have small Pine-Apples in Fruit, which are not noble enough to be\r\nbrought to the Table, twist off their Crowns, and pare them; then slice\r\nthem, and put them into a Syrup of Water, Sugar, and Pippins; and boil them\r\nwith half their quantity of Sugar added to them, with a little White Wine,\r\nbreaking them with a Spoon, as they boil, till they come to a Mash, or are\r\na little tender. Then take them from the Fire, and put the Marmalade into\r\nGlasses to keep, and cover every Glass with white Paper, preserving them in\r\na dry Place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo dress the Giblets of a _Tortoise,_ or _Sea-Turtle._ From a _Barbadoes_\r\nLady.\r\n\r\nTake the Head, the Feet, and the Tail, of either of these, and taking off\r\ntheir Scales, stew them three or four Hours, in Salt and Water, till they\r\nare almost tender; then broil them a little with Pepper and Salt on them,\r\nand then put them into a Stew-pan with a Shallot, and some Spice and sweet\r\nHerbs, according to your Taste; some strong Gravey, and some Wine, and\r\nthicken the Sauce, taking out the bunch of sweet Herbs. You may put then\r\nsome Juice of Limes to them, or Chadocks or Lemons, to make them fine.\r\n_N.B._ This is a dainty Dish, if they are broil'd, after the first stewing,\r\nbecause as they are sinewey, the Sinews ought to be a little scorched by\r\nbroiling, or else they will not be so tender as one would have them.\r\n\r\nThere are two Sorts of Tortoises, the Land, and the Sea-Tortoise; but the\r\nSea-Tortoise or Turtle, is what I mean, which is that which we have about\r\nthe _West-Indies_. This is a fine Animal, partaking of the Land and Water.\r\nIts Flesh between that of Veal, and that of a Lobster, and is extremely\r\npleasant, either roasted or baked. There are some of these Creatures that\r\nweigh near two hundred Weight. They are frequently brought to _England_ in\r\nTubs of Sea Water, and will keep alive a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo roast a Piece of _Turtle,_ or _Tortoise._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake a piece of the Flesh of about five or six Pounds, and lay it in Salt\r\nand Water two Hours; then stick a few Cloves in it, and fasten it to the\r\nSpit, baste it at first with Wine and Lemon-Juice; and when it is near\r\nenough, drudge some Flour over it, with the raspings of Bread sifted; and\r\nthen baste it well, either with Oil, or Butter, strewing on, from time to\r\ntime, more Flour and Raspings till it is enough; then take the Liquor in\r\nthe Pan, and pouring off the Fat, boil it with some Lemon-Peel, and a\r\nlittle Sugar and Salt, and pour it over the Turtle. So serve it hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make a _Turtle,_ or _Tortoise-_Pye. From the same.\r\n\r\nCut the Flesh of Turtle, or Tortoise, into Slices, about an Inch thick;\r\nthen take Cloves beaten fine, with some Pepper and Salt, and a little sweet\r\nHerbs, and season your Pieces with them; then lay them in your Crust, with\r\nsome Lemons sliced, and a quarter of a Pint of Oil-Olive pour'd over them,\r\nOr else some Butter laid in bits upon them. In the cutting your Pieces,\r\ndistribute your Fat and Lean, equally as may be; and though the Fat is of a\r\ngreenish colour, it is yet very delicious: then close your Pye, and just\r\nbefore you put it in the Oven, pour in some White Wine, and bake it in a\r\ngentle Oven till it is tender. Then serve it hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo preserve _Ginger-Roots._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake Roots of Ginger, as we have them dry in _England_; wash them well, and\r\nlay one Pound of them to steep, ten or twelve Days, in White Wine and\r\nWater, stirring them every Day. Then take two Quarts of White Wine, and\r\nabout half a Pint of Lemon-Juice, and boil them together a quarter of an\r\nHour; then add two Pounds and a half of fine Sugar, and boil it to a Syrup,\r\ntaking off the Scum as it rises; then put in your Ginger, and boil it a\r\nquarter of an Hour; then let it cool in a glazed Pan till the next Day, and\r\nthen boil it again in the Syrup for half an Hour, and let it cool, as\r\nbefore, till the Day following, and repeat the boiling and cooling till\r\nyour Ginger is clear, and put it into your Glasses, and cover them with\r\nPapers. It makes a fine Sweet-meat for the Winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo preserve _Ginger-Roots,_ fresh taken out of the Ground. From the same.\r\n\r\nAs Ginger is very common in the _West-Indies_, so the Roots are either\r\npreserved or pickled, when they are fresh taken out of the Ground, and we\r\nhave now Ginger, growing in Pots, almost in every Garden where there is a\r\nStove; and in a Year's time a single Root will almost fill a Pot; so that\r\none might easily have enough of our own, to preserve every Year. We must\r\ntake them up, when they have no Leaves upon them; and then scald them in\r\nWater, and rub them with a coarse Cloth till they are dry; then put them\r\ninto White Wine and Water, and boil them half an. Hour; then let them cool,\r\nand boil them again half an Hour. Then make a Syrup with White Wine two\r\nQuarts, half a Pint of Lime or Lemon-Juice, and two Pounds and a half of\r\nfine Sugar, with two Ounces of the Leaves of Orange-Flowers. When these\r\nboil together, put in your Ginger, and boil it gently half an Hour; then\r\nlet it cool in an earthen glaz'd Vessel, and continue to boil it every Day,\r\nand cooling it till the Roots of your Ginger are clear. Then put it up in\r\nGallypots, or in Glasses, and cover them with Papers, to keep for use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Paste of _Pippins,_ or other fine Apples. From the same.\r\n\r\nTake large Golden-Pippins, or Golden-Rennets, and scald them, with their\r\nSkins on; then pare them, and take out the Cores, and beat them in a Marble\r\nMortar very well, with a little Lemon-Peel grated. Take then their weight\r\nof fine Sugar, and a little Water, and boil that in a Skillet to a candy\r\nheight; then put in your Apples, and boil them thick in the Syrup till they\r\nwill leave the Skillet, and when it is almost cold, work it up with fine\r\nLoaf-Sugar powder'd, and mould it into Cakes, then dry them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo preserve _Cornelian-Cherries._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake Cornelian-Cherries, when they are full ripe, and take their weight in\r\nfine Sugar powder'd; then put these into your preserving Pan, and lay a\r\nLayer of Sugar, and another of Fruit; and so on till you have laid all in,\r\ncovering them with Sugar; then pour upon them half a Pint of White Wine,\r\nand set it on the Fire, and as soon as the Sugar is all melted, boil them\r\nup quick, and take off the Scum as it rises, stirring them every now and\r\nthen: and when the Fruit is clear, they are enough. Then put them into\r\nGlasses, and cover them with Papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Marmalade_ of _Cornelian-Cherries._ From the same.\r\n\r\nWhen your Cornelian-Cherries are full ripe, take out the Stones, and to\r\nevery Pound of Fruit, take its weight of fine Sugar powder'd. Wet it with\r\nWhite Wine, and boil it to a candy'd height; then put in your Fruit, with\r\nthe Juice that comes from them; then boil them very quick, and stir it\r\noften, scumming it clean; and when you see it very clear, and of a good\r\nConsistence, put it into a glaz'd earthen Pan; and when it is almost cold,\r\nput it into Glasses, and cover them with white Paper, and keep it in a dry\r\nRoom. _Note_, If you let any of these sharp Fruits stand to cool in your\r\nSweet-meat-Pans, they will take an ill taste from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Jamm_ of _Damsons._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake Damsons, full ripe, a Gallon; pick them from the Stalks, that may\r\nhappen to be about them, and the Leaves that are sometimes gather'd with\r\nthem: then take near their weight of Sugar, and about a Quart of Water, and\r\nboil them well together, and put in your Damsons, and boil them till they\r\nare tender, breaking them with a Spoon, all the while, till the whole is\r\nthicken'd. Then put it in Gallypots, and set it to cool; then close the\r\nPots down with Leather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo preserve _Currans_ in _Jelly._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake some of the large _Dutch_ red or white Currans, when they are ripe,\r\nand pick them from the Stalks; then, with a Pin, pick out the Stones; or,\r\nyou may, if you will, leave them on the Stalks, if they are large Bunches,\r\nbut still pick out the Kernels. Then take their weight in Sugar, and wet it\r\nwith a little Water, and add a little Syrup of Raspberries to it; then boil\r\nit to a Syrup, scumming it as it rises: then put in your Currans, and boil\r\nthem up quick, shaking them often, still taking off the Scum as it rises.\r\nThey will be enough done to put up, when the Syrup will jelly, as you may\r\ntry by putting some in a Spoon, and letting it cool. When you find this,\r\npour out all into Glasses, when it has cool'd a little. If your Currans are\r\npick'd from the Stalks, or if they are in Bunches, then let the Syrup be\r\nhalf cold, and pour it into the Glasses; and then put in your Bunches,\r\nplacing them as you would have them situated, and as it cools, they will\r\nfix in their several Stations; cover the Glasses then with white Paper.\r\n\r\n_Note_, The red Currans ought to be done by themselves, and the white by\r\nthemselves, for both together will make a disagreeable Mixture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo dry _Apricots._ From Mrs. _Walsingham_ of _Suffolk._\r\n\r\nChuse for this use, the large Turkey or Roman-Apricot, almost ripe; Stone\r\nthem, and pare them; then throw them into cold Water, with the Parings;\r\nweigh the pared Apricots, and prepare an equal weight of fine Sugar\r\npowder'd; then put some of the Water the Apricots were steep'd in, to the\r\nSugar, and boil them to a candy'd height: you may then put in your\r\nApricots, and boil them till they are clear, and when they have lain a few\r\nDays, in the Syrup, lay them upon a fine Wyre-Sieve, and dry them in a warm\r\nPlace. Then, when they are done, put them in oaken Boxes, with Papers\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo stew a Rump of _Beef._ From Mrs. _L----_\r\n\r\nTake a small Rump of Beef, lay it in a long Pan, deep enough to allow your\r\nBeef to be cover'd; then put to it a Pint of Ale, a Quart of Claret, half a\r\nPint of Verjuice, or the Juice of two large Lemons; and as much Water\r\nadded, as will make Liquor enough to cover it, a Crust of Bread burnt, an\r\nAnchovy, some bits of Lemon-Peel, a bunch of sweet Herbs, two large\r\n_Hertfordshire_ Turnips cut in dice, two large Onions cut in halves, some\r\nPepper and Salt, a Nutmeg sliced, a few Cloves, and a little Mace. Stop\r\nthis close, and let it stew, at least, five Hours; then lay your Beef in\r\nthe Dish, and pass the Liquor through a Sieve, and fill the Dish with it;\r\ngarnishing with Turnips, cut in Dice, boil'd tender, and then fry'd in\r\nHog's-Lard, and sliced Lemon, or you may bake your Rump of Beef, if you\r\nwill, for it is much the same. And this way you may likewise bake or stew a\r\nLeg of Beef, or an Ox-Cheek, only break the Bones of the Leg of Beef, and\r\ntake out all the Bones of the Ox-Cheek, and take especially Care to clean\r\nit, for it requires some nicety to do it well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pepper-Mint Water,_ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake Pepper-Mint six handfuls, cut it a little, and infuse it two Days in\r\nsix Quarts of clean Spirit; then draw it off in a cold Still, marking every\r\nBottle, as it fills, with a Number, for the first Bottle will be far the\r\nstrongest, the second less strong, and the third weaker than the second;\r\nand so as we draw off more, they will be still weaker, till at last it\r\nbecomes almost insipid, and somewhat sourish, but take none of that; then\r\ncover the Mouth of your Bottles with Papers prick'd full of Holes, and let\r\nthem stand a Day or two; then pour your first Bottle into a large earthen\r\nglaz'd Pan; and to that the second, and then the third, and the fourth, and\r\nso on, till by mixing they all become of a sufficient strength; then put\r\nthem in Bottles, with a Knob or two of double-refin'd Loaf-Sugar, and cork\r\nthem close. This is an incomparable pleasant Dram, tasting like Ice, or\r\nSnow, in the Mouth, but creates a fine warmth in the Stomach, and yields a\r\nmost refreshing Flavour.\r\n\r\nThis Sort of Mint is hard to be met with; but is lately cultivated in some\r\nPhysick Gardens at _Mitcham_. It must be kept well weeded, and the top of\r\nthe Bed, where it grows, must, when we cut it, be pricked up, a little,\r\nwith a small Fork, or the Earth made fine with a Trowel; because the\r\nRunners, of this sort of Mint, shoot along upon the Surface of the Ground,\r\nand so at the Joints strike Root, which is contrary to other Sorts of Mint,\r\nwhich shoot their Runners under ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Damson-Wine_ to imitate _Claret._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake nine Gallons of Water, make it scalding hot, and pour it upon six and\r\nthirty Pounds of _Malaga_ Raisins well pick'd from the Stalks. The Raisins\r\nshould be sound, or they will spoil your Wine. While the Water is yet hot,\r\nput into the Liquor half a Peck of Damsons full ripe, and pick'd clean of\r\nthe Stalks and Leaves, to each Gallon of Liquor; then stir them all\r\ntogether in the open Tub we make this Infusion in, and continue stirring\r\nthem twice a Day for six Days. Keep this Tub cover'd with a Cloth all that\r\ntime: then let it stand five or six Days longer, without stiring, and then\r\ndraw it off: and if it is not deep-colour'd enough, put a little Syrup of\r\nMulberries to it, and work it with a piece of White-Bread toasted, and\r\nspread with Yeast or Barm, in an open Vessel; and then tun it, keeping the\r\nBung of the Vessel open till the Wine has done singing in the Cask. Then\r\nslop it close, and let it stand till it is clear, which will be in two or\r\nthree Months; then draw it off. Some will just give their Damsons a scald\r\nin the Water before they pour it on the Raisins, which is a good way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Cure a _Lap-Dog,_ when he continues drowsy some Days, and cannot eat.\r\nFrom the same.\r\n\r\nIf you find a Lap-Dog to be sleepy, and will not take his Victuals for two\r\nor three Days; or if he eats, and as often discharges it soon after; take a\r\nlarge Tea-spoon-full of Rum or Brandy, and as much Water, and holding his\r\nHead up, and his Mouth open with one Hand, pour it down his Throat. This is\r\nquantity enough for one of the smallest Dogs, and will cure him in less\r\nthan half an Hour; but as the Dogs are larger, you may give to the biggest\r\na large spoonful of Rum or Brandy equally mix'd with Water, and so in\r\nproportion to the size of the Dog. It is a sure Remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dog-Grass,_ or _Couch-Grass,_ or _Twitch-Grass,_ necessary to be had,\r\ngrowing in Pots in _London,_ to cure _Lap-Dogs,_ that are sick, in the\r\nSummer. From the same.\r\n\r\nCouch-Grass is one of the Gardener's Plagues, and is in every Garden too\r\nmuch. Take a Clump of this, and set it in a large Garden-Pot, and letting\r\nit stand as airy as possible, water it gently every other Morning. There is\r\none sort of it, which is finely variegated, the Leaves appearing like\r\nstriped Ribbons. This fine sort is at the Ivy-House at _Hoxton_, where it\r\nmay be put in Pots at any time. This, or the other, should be put to a Dog,\r\nat any time, when he is sick, and he will eat it greedily, and cure\r\nhimself; but for want of this Help, which favourite Lap-Dogs in _London_\r\nwant, they lose their briskness. I believe it would be worth some poor\r\nWoman's while to sell this Grass, in _London_, where so many fine Lap-Dogs\r\nare kept, and indulged so much, that they cannot be taken abroad to search\r\ntheir Physick; while those of the larger kind take their way abroad, in the\r\nMornings, at their pleasure. This, Sir, I send you with some other\r\nReceipts, because Dogs are not a little useful about a Farm, and the little\r\nones are no less agreeable to their Keepers. And I am sure, if you publish\r\nthese, they will prove very acceptable to many Ladies, and Gentlemen, who\r\nare Admirers of these faithful Creatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _I am, &c._\r\n    J. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lisbon_ or _Portugal-Cakes._ From the same_,_\r\n\r\nTake a Pound of double-refin'd Loaf-Sugar beaten fine, and past through a\r\nfine Sieve. Mix this with a Pound of fine Flour; then rub into these a\r\nPound of fresh or new Butter, till your Sugar and Flour looks like\r\nBread-Crumbs; then add, two or three spoonfulls of Orange-Flower-Water, and\r\nabout ten spoonfuls of Canary-Wine: then beat ten Eggs, till their Whites\r\nare whipt to Snow, and mix the Eggs, with the rest, with a quarter of a\r\nPound of blanched Almonds beaten in a Marble Mortar, with some Orange-Flower\r\nWater; and when you have butter'd your Pans well, fill them half full with\r\nthis Mixture, and bake them, if you make them without Currans, or else fill\r\nthe Pans fuller, first plumping the Currans, which should be in proportion,\r\nas you please.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Imperial Florentine._ From _Mr. Byecorf_ at _Augsburgh._\r\n\r\nCut the leanest part of a Leg of Veal, in thin Slices, and beat them with\r\nthe Back of a Knife, as you would do _Scots_ Collups; then season the\r\nCutlets with Cloves, Pepper beaten fine to powder, some Pepper and Salt,\r\nwith some Nutmeg grated, a little dry'd sweet Marjoram powder'd, or some\r\nsweet Basil. Lay this Mixture pretty thick upon them, and roll them up with\r\na little Piece of fat Bacon, in the middle; then lay in your Paste to the\r\nDish, and over the Bottom strew a little Pepper, Salt, and Nutmeg, with\r\nsome Balls of farced Meat, with bits of Butter, placed here and there. Put\r\nin then your rolls of Veal, with some Cocks-Combs blanched, a quarter of a\r\nPint of Mushroom Buttons pickled, some Slices of Lemon, with half a Pint of\r\nWhite Wine, and about a Pint of Water; then close your Pye, and when it is\r\nbaked, serve it hot. _N.B._ Before you close it, put some bits of Butter on\r\nthe top of your Rolls of Meat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Farced Meat, for the foregoing _Florentine._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake the Lean of a Leg of Veal, chop it small, and beat it well in a Marble\r\nMortar, with as much Fat of the Kidney of Veal; and then put some Pepper,\r\nSalt, Cloves, Nutmeg, Powder of dry'd sweet Marjoram, and some Mushrooms,\r\nchopt as you please; then add as many Eggs, beaten as you think proper,\r\nwith some grated Bread, to make it into a Paste, and roll this Mixture into\r\nBalls. Some instead of the Kidney-Fat of Veal, will chop the same quantity\r\nof fat Bacon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make a Tart of white _Beet-Cards._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake some white Beet-Cards, (or Leaves) as much Spinach-Leaves, and the\r\nsame quantity of _French_ Sorrel, which has a round Leaf. Chop these small,\r\nor if you beat them all together in a Marble Mortar, it is better; then\r\nstrain out the Juice, and put it amongst the same proportion, or quantity,\r\nof the same Herbs, fresh cut, that is, put the Liquor to as many Herbs as\r\nyou cut before, and shred them; then add to them about five Ounces of good\r\nSugar, and you may put as much Currans. Mix these well, and bake them; then\r\npour over it, while it is hot, some Cream that has been boil'd thick, and\r\nserve it hot: but if you use raw Cream, from the Dairy, you must mix it\r\nwith the Ingredients, and then strew fine powder'd Sugar over it, but serve\r\nit hot, let it be which way you will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make a Preserve of _Quinces,_ white in _Jelly._ From the same.\r\n\r\nMake a Syrup of Golden-Pippins, or Golden-Rennets; and to make that, pare\r\nyour Apples, and core them, but never use two sorts together, for one will\r\nbe soft before the other is half done. Always take this for a Rule in\r\nApples, Onions, and Turnips; they should be all of one kind, and all from\r\nthe same Place, or else you will be disappointed. Boil your Apples with\r\ntheir weight in Sugar, and as much Water as will mix with it: boil this to\r\na Jelly, and in the mean time, pare your Quinces, and cut them in Quarters,\r\ntaking them clear off the Core; then boil them, first in fair Water, till\r\nthey are a little tender, and then put them into the boiling Syrup, and\r\nkeep them gently boiling half an Hour, or what one might more properly call\r\nstewing. If the Quinces are not then clear, boil them again, the next Day,\r\nin the same Liquor; and when the Quinces are as clear as they can be, which\r\nis never very much like other Fruits, but we should rather say tender, put\r\nthem into Gallypots, or Glasses, and pour the Syrup, or Jelly, over them,\r\nto keep; and as soon as they are cold, then put Papers over them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Candy whole _Orange,_ or _Lemon-Peels._\r\n\r\nTake some of the fairest Oranges, or Lemons, and cut a small hole in the\r\ntop of them; then scoop out all the Pulp, as clean as possible; lay these\r\nin Water to steep eight or ten Days, shifting them to fresh Waters twice a\r\nDay; then boil them in several Waters, till they are tender enough to run a\r\nStraw through them. Then take one Pound of double-refin'd Loaf-Sugar to\r\neach Pound of Peel, and a Quart of Water: then make your Syrup, and boil\r\nyour Peels in it eight or ten Minutes, and let them stand in your Syrup\r\nfive or six Days, in an earthen glaz'd Vessel, for it would spoil in a\r\nBrass or Copper Pan: then to every Pound put one Pound more of Sugar into\r\nyour Syrup, and boil your Peels in it, till they are clear; then put them\r\ninto Gallypots, and boil your Syrup till it is almost of a Candy height,\r\nand pour it upon your Peels; and when it is cold, cover it. The same manner\r\nthey preserve the Peels of green Oranges, Lemons, and Limes, in\r\n_Barbadoes_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo stew _Soles._ From _Yarmouth._\r\n\r\nTake the largest Soles you can get, gut them, and skin them; lay them then\r\ninto a Stew-pan, and pour in about a Pint of good Beef Gravey, and as much\r\nClaret; some bits of Lemon-Peel, an Anchovy or two, a stick of\r\nHorse-Radish, a bunch of sweet Herbs, a large Onion, half a large Nutmeg,\r\nsome Cloves and Mace, whole Pepper, and Salt, with a little bit of Butter.\r\nThen stew these till the Fish is enough, and pour off the Liquor, through a\r\nSieve, and thicken it with burnt Butter, having first put to it the Juice\r\nof a Lemon. Then pour the Sauce over the Fish, and garnish with Lemon\r\nsliced, and the Roots of red Beets pickled and sliced, with Horse-Radish\r\nscraped, and fry'd Bread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Hash of raw _Beef._ From Mr. _Moring_ at the Blue-Posts _Temple-Bar._\r\n\r\nCut some thin Slices of tender Beef, and put them in a Stew-Pan, with a\r\nlittle Water, a bunch of sweet Herbs, some Lemon-Peel, an Onion, with some\r\nPepper, Salt, and some Nutmeg. Cover these close, and let them stew till\r\nthey are tender; then pour in a Glass or two of Claret; and when it is\r\nwarm, clear your Sauce of the Onion, Herbs, _&c_. and thicken it with burnt\r\nButter. It is an excellent Dish. Serve it hot, and garnish with Lemon\r\ndiced, and red Beet-Roots, Capers, and such like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThin _Beef-Collups_ stew'd. From _Oxford._\r\n\r\nCut raw Beef in thin Slices, as you would do Veal, for _Scots_ Collups; lay\r\nthem in a Dish, with a little Water, a Glass of Wine, a Shallot, some\r\nPepper and Salt, and a little sweet Marjoram powdered; then clap another\r\nDish over that, having first put a thin slice or two of fat Bacon among\r\nyour Collups: then set your Mess, so as to rest upon the backs of two\r\nChairs, and take six Sheets of whited-brown Paper, and tear it in long\r\nPieces; and then lighting one of them, hold it under the Dish, till it\r\nburns out, then light another, and so another till all your Paper is burnt;\r\nand then your Stew will be enough, and full of Gravey. Some will put in a\r\nlittle Mushroom Gravey, with the Water, and the other Ingredients, which is\r\nyet a very good way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStew'd _Beef-Steaks._ From the _Spring-Gardens_ at _Vaux-Hall, Surrey._\r\n\r\nTake good Rump-Beef Steaks, and season them with Pepper and Salt; then lay\r\nthem into the Pan, and pour in a little Water; then add a bunch of sweet\r\nHerbs a few Cloves, an Anchovy, a little Verjuice, an Onion, and a little\r\nLemon-Peel, with a little bit of Butter, or fat Bacon, and a Glass of White\r\nWine. Cover these close, and stew them gently, and when they are tender,\r\npour away the Sauce, and strain it; then take out the Steaks, and flour\r\nthem, and fry them; and when you put them in the Dish, thicken the Sauce,\r\nand pour it over them. This way was much approved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Cologn's-Geneva._ From _Cologn._\r\n\r\nTake good Brandy, one Gallon; then take two Pounds of Juniper-berries fresh\r\ngather'd, and full ripe. Press these till you perceive a greenish Liquor\r\ncome from them; then put them into the Brandy, and let them remain about\r\nten Days: then pour them through a Cloth of coarse Linnen, and squeeze it,\r\nand when you have the Liquor, if you find it too strong, you may add to it\r\nsome more Brandy, and half a Pound of fine Sugar to a Gallon. Then put it\r\nin Flasks, or Bottles.\r\n\r\nThen take the Pressings, and infuse them again in Brandy, for six or seven\r\nDays, and distil them. This they call double _Cologn's_ Gin, and the best\r\nis sold in _Holland_, at three Shillings and Six-pence _per_ Quart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Scots-Snuff,_ or pure _Tobacco-Snuff._ From Mr. _Hyslop._\r\n\r\nTake the Leaves of good Tobacco, and spread them open; then dry them gently\r\nin the Sun, or before the Fire, and strip them from the Stalks; when the\r\nleafy part will crumble, between the Fingers; then put it into a Mill, and\r\nwith a Pestle rolling about it, the Tobacco will presently be ground, as\r\nfine as Snuff; or else, if you have never a Mill, when your Tobacco will\r\nbreak between the Fingers, lay it on an oaken Table, and pass the flat side\r\nof a Knife over it, backwards and forwards, as if you was whetting it,\r\npressing it hard, and you will make fine Snuff. This I mention here,\r\nbecause, sometimes, the Snuff-takers are without Snuff, and remote from any\r\nPlace where it may be had, and would give any Money for it; which was my\r\nCase, when I learn'd this Receipt, and by the last Means was presently\r\nsupplied: we may make it likewise of cut Tobacco dry'd before the Fire.\r\n\r\nOr if we raise Tobacco in our Gardens, pick the Leaves from the Stalks,\r\ntowards the Root, when they are full grown, tie six in a bunch together,\r\nand hang them up to dry in the Shade; then dip them in Water, or some Beer\r\nor Ale, and hang them up again to dry, and then press the Leaves one upon\r\nanother, in their Bunches, in a Box or Tub, as hard as possible; and in a\r\nfew Months time, they will make very good Snuff, being order'd as above\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Butter_ turned to _Oil_ recovered. From Mrs. _M. N._\r\n\r\nThere are some Lands, as well as some Treatments of Butter in the Dairy,\r\nthat makes the Butter so very fat and greasy, that it is hard to melt,\r\nwithout running to Oil; while, on the other hand, there is a sort of\r\nButter, which cuts as firm as Wax; and even this will sometimes turn to Oil\r\nin the melting, but very seldom. However, when it so happens, pour your\r\noil'd Butter into a Porringer, and letting it stand a little, melt a little\r\nfresh, and as soon as it is liquid, pour into it, by gentle degrees, at\r\ntimes, some of the Butter that was oil'd before, keeping your Sauce-pan\r\nshaking all the while; and if you find it any way difficult to be\r\nrecovered, pour in a little Milk, and shake them together, and it will\r\nrecover. _Memorandum_, A Sauce-pan that is very thin at the Bottom is apt\r\nto oil Butter, let it be ever so good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Orange_ or _Lemon-Cakes._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake some preserv'd Orange or Lemon-Peels, wash'd from their Syrup; then\r\nbeat them, in a Marble Mortar, to a Pulp, adding a little Orange-Flower\r\nWater to them, and a very little Gum-Arabic to it powder'd, this will\r\nbecome a Paste; then mould it into Cakes, with double-refined Sugar beaten\r\nfine, and dry them; they must then be laid in Boxes, between sheets of\r\nwhite Paper, and kept in a dry Place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo dry _Plums,_ of any sort, without _Sugar._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake a Wyre Sieve, and gather your Plums, not too ripe, nor in the heat of\r\nthe Day; run a Needle through the Skin of each of them, and lay them on the\r\nSieve, so as not to touch one another. Put your Sieve then into a declining\r\nOven, and let it stand twelve Hours; then set it by, and repeat the same\r\nthe second and third time, and if the Plums are large, then it may be they\r\nwill require the fourth or fifth time; but turn them every time, when you\r\nare going to put them in the Oven. They will dry by this Means so well,\r\nthat you may keep them all the Winter, for use, in Boxes, in a dry Place.\r\n_Memorandum_, Some of them will candy on the Outsides. The Mussel-Plum is a\r\nvery good one for this use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Shropshire_ and _Worcestershire-Dish._ From the same.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIf you would please all People, by the several Receipts you publish, you\r\nought to have the particular Dish that is the Favourite of every County. In\r\n_Worcestershire_ and _Shropshire_, the following is in esteem, and I\r\nbelieve you will oblige several Gentlemen and Ladies of these Parts, if you\r\nwould insert it in some of your Works.\r\n\r\nTake some good middling Bacon, and fry it; then put in some Calf's Liver,\r\nand cut it in thick Pieces, pepper it, and salt it; and when it is enough,\r\nfor it must not be fry'd hard, have ready prepared some Cabbage-Lettuce,\r\nsome white Beet-Cards, or Beet-Leaves, and some Spinach-Leaves, and chop\r\nthem together, with some Parsley, but not too small; then chop some Onion,\r\nand mix with the rest; then throw them into your Frying pan, with a piece\r\nof Butter, when the Bacon and Liver is out, and fry them till they are\r\ntender, and as brown as may be; putting in a spoonful of Verjuice, or the\r\nJuice of a Lemon, a little before they are enough. And having kept the\r\nLiver and Bacon hot all the while, pour these Herbs over them, which ought\r\nto be in good quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFine _Cakes_ to keep. From the same.\r\n\r\nTake a Pound of fine Sugar powder'd, and somewhat less than a Quart of\r\nFlour. Rub these with a Pound of fresh Butter, and mix it with three or\r\nfour Yolks of Eggs, with some Orange-Flower-Water, and a little Ale-Yeast:\r\nset this Paste before the Fire to rise, and roll out your Cakes thin, while\r\nthe Paste is hot; then cut them into what Shapes you please, and prick them\r\non the top, and bake them in a gentle Oven. They will keep a long time and\r\nare very good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Penzance-Cakes._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake the Yolks of Eggs well beaten, put to them some Mace finely powder'd,\r\nwith a few spoonfuls of Wine, a little Salt, and as much Sugar as you\r\nplease; then add as much Flour as is necessary, and a small quantity of\r\nAle-Yeast, and work your Dough pretty stiff; then add some fresh Butter,\r\nbroken in little bits, and work it in till all the Paste has partaken of\r\nit, and the Dough becomes as stiff as at first. Make your Cakes then, and\r\nbake them. They will keep some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Crystal candy'd _Sweet-meats._ From the same.\r\n\r\nWhen we propose to make these candy'd Sweet-meats, we must first know what\r\nFruits, Flowers, _&c_. are proper for them, and how those ought to be\r\ngathered and prepared.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, to begin with the Flowers. Take Orange-Flowers, or Lemon, or\r\nCitron-Flowers; gather them, when the Dew is upon them, in the Morning,\r\nbecause the Leaves of them will be then full, and then they are best to\r\nuse, when the Leaves are pick'd off, and then the Dew will be gone; but if\r\nthey lie a Day, they will shrink, turn bitter, and of a yellowish brown\r\nColour. Take these Leaves fresh pick'd, and pour the following Composition\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nYou may take also some Orange, or Lemon, or Citron, preserved, and dry'd,\r\nand cut them in small pieces. Or Apricots dry'd and cut into small pieces,\r\nor such sorts as are a little hard in themselves will do. If one was to cut\r\nsome Pine-Apple, or Ananas, simply or preserv'd, and cut that in pieces, it\r\nwould be entomb'd in a Rock of Sugar; or Currans preserv'd upon their\r\nStalks may do, if you think it worth while; but Orange-Flower-Leaves do\r\nvery well. It is a fine Candy to carry in the Pocket.\r\n\r\nThen to begin your Business. Take one Pound of double-refined Loaf-Sugar\r\nbeat small, and finely sifted; mix this with four or five spoonfuls of\r\nOrange-Flower-Water, and about half a Drachm of Gum-Arabic finely beaten;\r\nthen put three spoonfuls of White Wine, and mix all together, and boil them\r\nin a glazed earthen Vessel till the Liquor will hardly run, or at least run\r\nin Ropes; then have small Jars of earthen Ware glazed, and put into each of\r\nthem the several sorts of Fruits, and Flowers, you would inclose in candy'd\r\nSugar, making those Jars very hot, and immediately pour the Liquor upon\r\nthem, and stop them close; then put the Jars into a Stove, for a fortnight\r\nor more, and you may then break the Jars, and your several Fruits and\r\nFlowers will be inclosed in a crystal like Candy, such as white Sugar\r\nCandy. And then with a slight blow of an Hammer, break these Candies into\r\nPieces of about a Finger's length, and keep them in Glasses stopt close, in\r\na dry Place, and they will remain good several Years. The little Pots must\r\nbe broken of course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make a _Hackin._ From a Gentleman in _Cumberland._\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThere are some Counties in _England_, whose Customs are never to be set\r\naside; and our Friends in _Cumberland_, as well as some of our Neighbours\r\nin _Lancashire_, and else-where, keep them up. It is a Custom with us every\r\n_Christmas_-Day in the Morning, to have, what we call an Hackin, for the\r\nBreakfast of the young Men who work about our House; and if this Dish is\r\nnot dressed by that time it is Day-light, the Maid is led through the Town,\r\nbetween two Men, as fast as they can run with her, up Hill and down Hill,\r\nwhich she accounts a great shame. But as for the Receipt to make this\r\nHackin, which is admired so much by us, it is as follows.\r\n\r\nTake the Bag or Paunch of a Calf, and wash it, and clean it well with Water\r\nand Salt; then take some Beef-Suet, and shred it small, and shred some\r\nApples, after they are pared and cored, very small. Then put in some Sugar,\r\nand some Spice beaten small, a little Lemon-Peel cut very fine, and a\r\nlittle Salt, and a good quantity of Grots, or whole Oat-meal, steep'd a\r\nNight in Milk; then mix these all together, and add as many Currans pick'd\r\nclean from the Stalks, and rubb'd in a coarse Cloth; but let them not be\r\nwash'd. And when you have all ready, mix them together, and put them into\r\nthe Calf's-Bag, and tye them up, and boil them till they are enough. You\r\nmay, if you will, mix up with the whole, some Eggs beaten, which will help\r\nto bind it. This is our Custom to have ready, at the opening of the Doors,\r\non _Christmas_-Day in the Morning. It is esteem'd here; but all that I can\r\nsay to you of it, is, that it eats somewhat like a _Christmas_-Pye, or is\r\nsomewhat like that boil'd. I had forgot to say, that with the rest of the\r\nIngredients, there should be some Lean of tender Beef minced small.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Northampton-Cake._\r\n\r\nTake a Peck of Flour, and a Pound of fine Sugar beaten well into Powder,\r\nand sifted; then add a quarter of an Ounce of Cloves, half an Ounce of\r\nCinnamon, and a large Nutmeg, and beat them to powder; put to this some\r\nOrange-Flower-Water, or Rose-Water; then take five or six Pounds of Currans\r\nwell pick'd, and rub'd dry with a coarse Cloth, but not wash'd. Put these\r\nwith your Fruit, and a little Salt into the Flour; then take as much Cream\r\nas you think proper: then melt two Pounds of Butter, to mix with it, and\r\nadd a Pint of Canary-Wine, and kneed it with some fresh Ale-Yeast, till it\r\nrises under your hand. Have your Oven hot before you put it in the Hoop for\r\nBaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the Baking of Fruit. From Mr. _L. M._\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, that all Fruits that are ripe require little baking,\r\nand those which are of the hardest, or most unripe Sorts, ought to have a\r\nlong and gentle baking. In Pears, for example, when we have some of those,\r\nwhich ripen in the Autumn, they will bake with a Tart; for as they are ripe\r\nof themselves, they require very little baking, for Ripeness is one degree\r\ntending to Rottenness; and as that is done by heat gently, so the Oven\r\nbrings that to a certain height, suddenly, with its safeguard of Sugar;\r\nthat the Fruit comes to its full flavour, with the additional beauty, from\r\nthe Sugar. It would have done a great deal by Nature itself, if the Tree\r\nhad stood in a place agreeable; but much more would it be for those baking\r\nPears, as we call them, if they had the advantage of a good Climate; one\r\nmay guess then how much difference there is between one and the other. In\r\nthe tough and hard Pears, one ought to bake them twice, that is, once with\r\na little Water and Sugar, in as hot an Oven as they bake Bread in; and then\r\nput them in Pyes, and bake them over again, so will they become tender,\r\nwell tasted, and of a fine colour. But be it as it will, as soon as either\r\nof these come out of the Oven, pour some Cream over them, and mix it with\r\nthem, if they are to be served hot, mashing the Fruit all the while; but if\r\nthey are to be served cold, then only pour some Cream over them, when they\r\njust come from the Oven, and let it remain till you serve it cold.\r\n\r\nThere is one way which is practised by some, and that is, to break the hard\r\nPears, just when they are taken out of the Oven, in the Pye; for else the\r\noutsides, though the Rind is off, will be hard, and tough: then pour on the\r\nCream. It is to be noted, that all ripe Apples require less baking, and\r\nless Sugar, than the hard Apples, which do not become ripe till some Months\r\nafterwards. When an Apple, or Pear, for example, is as ripe as it can be in\r\nour Climate, it will have some softness, and some sweetness in it, and\r\ntherefore will require less baking, as baking is only a sort of ripening;\r\nand so on the other hand: but we are providentially provided with both\r\nApples and Pears, which are, some ripe sooner, and some ripe later; even\r\nthat by the end of _July,_ we have some ripe, and some remain hard and sour\r\ntill _June._ We ought be apprised of the Sorts, to take them in their\r\nseveral Seasons, and not to take the Winter Fruits, for baking, when we\r\nhave ripe Fruits by us. Many thousand Bushels of Fruit are lost for want of\r\nthis Caution.\r\n\r\nSo at any time, when you use Apples, or Pears, for Tarts, Puddings, or\r\nSauces, let them be all of one Sort, and ripe; for, if they are ripe, or\r\ntowards it, they will soon soften; and if you put two Sorts together, one\r\nwill be in Pulp very soon, and the other will be hard for an Hour or two,\r\nand at length will not be soft. _Memorandum,_ This is not to be\r\ndisregarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Paste. From Mrs. _Peasly._\r\n\r\nThere are many sorts of Paste made, and among them, are some which are made\r\nwith Eggs, according to the old fashion; but these are always hard, when\r\nthey are baked, though they will fly and crackle in the Mouth, but they\r\ntaste like Sticks: while, on the other side, leave out your Eggs, and use\r\nButter and Water only, as in the following Receipts, and your Paste will\r\nmelt in the Mouth, and be agreeable to the Taste.\r\n\r\nIf you would have a sweet Paste; then take half a Pound of Butter, and rub\r\nit into about a Pound of Flour, with two or three Ounces of double-refined\r\nSugar powder'd, and make it a Paste, with cold Milk, some Sack and Brandy.\r\nThis is a very good one.\r\n\r\nYou may also make an hot Paste, for minced Pyes, or such like, by taking a\r\nquantity of Flour as you like, and break a Pound or two of Butter into a\r\nlarge Sauce-pan of Water; and when the Butter is melted, make an hollow in\r\nthe midst of the Flour, and scumming off the Butter, throw it, at times,\r\ninto the Flour, with some of the boiling hot Water along with it; then,\r\nwhen you have enough for your use, work it into a stiff Paste, and lay it\r\nbefore the Fire, cover'd with a Cloth, and cut off such bits as you want,\r\njust when you are going to use them. This Paste does very well for raised\r\nPyes. Some will make this Paste by breaking in a Pound of Butter into a\r\nquarter of a Peck of Flour, and then pouring on it some scalding hot Water,\r\nenough to work it to a stiff Paste. As for Tarts, one may make the\r\nfollowing Puff-Paste. Rub in some Butter into your Flour, and make it into\r\na Paste with Water, and when it is moulded, roll it out till it is about\r\nhalf an Inch thick; then put bits of Butter upon it, about half an Inch\r\nasunder, and fold your Paste together, and then fold it again: then roll it\r\nagain till it becomes of the thickness it was before; and then lay bits of\r\nButter on it, as before directed, and fold it as mention'd above, and roll\r\nit again to the thickness of half an Inch; then put on the rest of your\r\nButter, and fold it up, and roll it for the last time, doubling it, and\r\nrolling it twice, before you use it. This is very good for Puffs, Puddings,\r\nor Petty-Patees.\r\n\r\nAs for Meat-Pyes, or Pasties, they require another sort of Paste, which is\r\nmade thus. Rub seven Pounds of Butter into a Peck of Flour, but not too\r\nsmall; then make it into a Paste with Water. It is good for\r\nVenison-Pasties, and such like great Pyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo dress a Dish of Fish in the best manner. From the same.\r\n\r\nTo make one of these grand Dishes, you ought always to have some capital\r\nsort of Fish, for the middle of the Dish; such as a Turbut, a Jowl of fresh\r\nSalmon, a Cod's Head, or a Pike boiled; and this must be adorn'd either\r\nwith Flounders, Whitings, Soles, Perch, Smelts, or Gudgeons, or Bourn\r\nTrouts, which are the small River Trouts, or young Salmon-Fry, according as\r\nyou can meet with them. This kind of Dish is call'd a Bisque of Fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo boil Fresh _Salmon._\r\n\r\nIf you have fresh Salmon, you wash it with Salt and Water, and according to\r\nthe Fashion, leave all the Scales on, though some take them off, to prevent\r\nthat trouble at the Table; for the Skin of the Salmon. is the fattest part\r\nof the Fish, and is liked by most People. Lay your Fish thus prepared, into\r\nthe Pan, where you boil it, and pour in Water, with a sixth part of\r\nVinegar, a little Salt, and a stick of Horse-Radish; this should be boiled\r\npretty quick: thus far for boiling fresh Salmon. The grand Sauce for it you\r\nwill see at the end of these Receipts, for preparing the several sorts of\r\nFish for the Bisque but if it is served alone, then let the Sauce be as\r\nfollows. Take a Pint of Shrimps, a Pint of Oysters and their Liquor, and\r\nhalf a Pint of pickled Mushrooms; or else take Shrimps, and the Bodies of\r\ntwo middling Sea-Crabs, or of a couple of Lobsters, the Tail of the\r\nLobsters to be cut in Dice, but use which you have by you. If you have\r\nOysters, stew them a little, in their own Liquor, with some Mace, and whole\r\nPepper, then lay by the Oysters, and put Mushroom Pickle to the Liquor, and\r\ndissolve two Anchovies in it; then melt what quantity of Butter you think\r\nfit, and mix your prepared Liquor with it, adding a little White Wine, or\r\nthat may be left out. I should take notice, that just before you melt your\r\nButter, put your Oysters, Shrimps, and Mushrooms, _&c._ into your prepared\r\nLiquor to boil up, and then mix all together. _Note,_ The Bodies of the\r\nCrabs being well stirred in the Liquor, will thicken it, and render the\r\nwhole very agreeable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo boil _Turbut, Flounders,_ or _Plaise, Pike,_ or a _Cod's-Head,_ or\r\n_Whitings._\r\n\r\nWhen your Fish are gutted and well wash'd: put them upon your Fish-Plate;\r\nthe Jacks or Pikes, whether small or great, must have their Tails skewer'd\r\ninto their Mouths, so that they make a round figure, which is the Fashion.\r\nThen put your Fish into the Kettle, into as much Water as will cover them.\r\nPut into this Water, an Onion, with some Cloves stuck in it, some Mace,\r\nsome whole Pepper, a little bunch of sweet Herbs, a stick of Horse-Radish,\r\nand half a Lemon. When your Liquor boils, add a little Vinegar, or\r\nVerjuice; and when your Fish are boiled enough, let them drain before the\r\nFire. The Sauce for these, if they are served singly, is that directed for\r\nthe Salmon, or else some melted Butter, Anchovies dissolved in Water, over\r\nthe Fire, and some Shrimps; or for want of them, if you can get any of the\r\nsmall Crabs, such as they sell in _London,_ about eight or ten a Penny, and\r\nno bigger in their Bodies than to contain the quantity of a Golden-Pippin.\r\nTake the Inside of the Bodies of these, and thicken your Sauce with them.\r\nOr if you have Cray-fish, take the Bodies of them, and mix them well with\r\nyour Sauce, and cut the Tails in small bits, as big as Pease. The foregoing\r\nway of boiling Fish gives them a relish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo fry _Soles, Flounders, Plaise, Whitings, Smelts,_ and _Gudgeons,_ or\r\nsuch like.\r\n\r\nTake a large quantity of Hog's-Seam, or Lard, and melt it in a Pan, till it\r\nis very hot; then put in your Fish, prepared as follows; but first you may\r\nfry some Bread, in Lengths, as big as one's Finger, to drain for a Garnish.\r\n\r\nAs for Soles, skin them, and gut them, then flour them well, and toss them\r\ninto the Pan, turning them once, when you see the upper side of a yellow\r\nColour. When they are enough, put them into a Cullendar to drain before the\r\nFire.\r\n\r\nFlounders are only to be gutted, and the Skins wash'd with Water and Salt,\r\nand being well dry'd with a Cloth, flour them, and fling them into the Pan,\r\nand use them as you did the Soles.\r\n\r\nThe Plaise are to be done in the same manner as the Flounders.\r\n\r\nWhitings must be treated in the same manner as the former.\r\n\r\nSmelts must be only rub'd with a coarse Cloth, and then flour'd, and thrown\r\ninto the Pan.\r\n\r\nGudgeons must be scaled and gutted, well dry'd and flour'd, and thrown into\r\nthe hot Lard: but take care in all these that you have a quick Fire under\r\nthem, and not too many in the Pan at one time.\r\n\r\nYou have now all your Furniture for your Bisque of Fish; but to fry them\r\nstill crisper, and better, use Sallad-Oil instead of Hogs-Lard; or if you\r\nhave neither of these, you may use good dripping of Beef, or Mutton, but\r\nthere must be enough of it, and it should be as hot as possible, in the\r\nPan, when you throw your Fish in. Serve these with melted Butter, and\r\nAnchovy Liquor, with Shrimps, or Oysters, if they are single.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo broil _Whitings._\r\n\r\nClean your Whitings, with Water and Salt, after they are gutted, and drying\r\nthem thoroughly, flour them well, then lay them on the Grid-Iron, first\r\nrubbing it with a little Chalk. As you find them enough on one side, turn\r\nthem, and serve them, if they go to the Table alone, with Butter melted,\r\nsome Anchovy Liquor, and Oyster Sauce; these may make one of your grand\r\nDishes of Fish, but fry'd and boiled is enough, because there is never a\r\nDish of this kind, but there are many more at the same Treat, which will\r\ngive the Cook a great deal of difficulty, and besides you must still in\r\nthis Dish have some Spitchcot-Eels.\r\n\r\n_N.B._ I forbear to mention here the manner of dresing Spitchcot-Eels, as\r\nthey are already set down in the first part of this Book.\r\n\r\nWhen you fry Whitings, skewer their Tails in their Mouths; and some take\r\noff their Skins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Grand Dish of Fish, and its Sauce.\r\n\r\nWhen we have prepared these things, with regard to the grand Dish we\r\ndesign, then make the following Sauce: _viz._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSauce for a Bisque of Fish.\r\n\r\nTake a Pint of Gravey, two or three spoonfuls of Mushroom Katchep, and a\r\nspoonful or two of Mushroom Pickle; then add about a Gill of White Wine,\r\nhalf an Onion, a slice of Lemon with the Peel, two Anchovies shred, some\r\nCloves, and Mace. When these have boiled half a quarter of an Hour, take\r\nout the Onion, and Lemon, and thicken your Liquor, with about three Pounds\r\nof Butter, rub'd in a little Flour; then put in the Body of a Crab, or\r\nLobster, Shrimps, Oysters, and Mushrooms, and it is ready to pour over your\r\nFish: but some rather chuse to serve this Sauce in Basons, lest it be too\r\nhigh for every Palate. However, when you have disposed your Fish well in\r\nthe Dish, garnish with fry'd Bread, Horse-Radish scraped, fry'd Parsley,\r\nLemon sliced and pickled, red Beet-Root sliced, and serve it up hot. If\r\nyour Sauce is serv'd in Basons; then take care to have one Bason of plain\r\nButter: but if all your Company happens to like the rich Sauce, your Dish\r\nof fish will make a much better appearance to have some of the Sauce pour'd\r\nover it, before you lay on your Garnish. Remember to lay your Spitchcot\r\nEels near the edge of the Dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo broil _Herrings,_ so as to prevent their rising in the Stomach. From the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nTake fresh Herrings, scale them, gut them, and wash them; and when they are\r\nwell dry'd with a Cloth, strew them with flour of Ginger, as you would any\r\nFish with Flour, then broil them; and when they are enough, the taste of\r\nthe Ginger is quite lost: then serve them with Claret, Butter, Salt, and\r\nMustard, made into a Sauce, and they will not at all disturb the Stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA white _Fricassee_ of _Rabbits._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake three or four young Rabbits and cut them to pieces, then put them in a\r\nStew-pan, with four Ounces of Butter; then season them with some Lemon-Peel\r\ngrated, a little Thyme, a little sweet Marjoram, Pepper, Salt, and a little\r\n_Jamaica_, Pepper beaten fine. Let these be close cover'd, and stew them\r\ngently, till they are tender; then take about half a Pint of Veal-Broth, an\r\nOnion, some Lemon, a Sprig of sweet Marjoram, and some Spice, to your mind,\r\nand put to it half a Gill of White Wine. Boil these together six or seven\r\nMinutes, then pour away the Butter, in the Stew-pan, and strain your Veal\r\nGravey through a Sieve; then beat the Yolks of four Eggs, with half a Pint\r\nof Cream. Then put some of the Broth, by degrees, to the Eggs and Cream,\r\nkeeping them stirring, lest they curdle, and you may put to it some Parsley\r\nboil'd tender, and shred small; then put it to the Rabbits, and toss them\r\nup thick with Butter, adding some pickled Mushrooms, and serve them hot\r\nwith a Garnish of sliced Lemon, and red Beet-Root pickled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA _Neat's-Tongue_ roasted. From the same.\r\n\r\nTake a large Neat's-Tongue, that has lain three Weeks in Salts mixed in the\r\nfollowing manner. Take a quarter of a Pound of Salt-Petre, half a Pound of\r\nBay-Salt, and three Pints of common Salt. This is enough to salt four\r\nTongues: let them be rubb'd well with this Mixture, and kept in a cool\r\nplace. Take, I say, one of these Tongues, and boil it till the Skin will\r\ncome off; and when it is stript of its Skin, stick it with Cloves, about an\r\nInch asunder, then put it on a Spit, and wrap a Veal-Cawl over it, till it\r\nis enough; then take off the Cawl, and just froth it up, and serve it in a\r\nDish with Gravey. _Note_, The Cawl will keep the outside tender, which\r\notherwise would be hard. One must serve with it, in Saucers, of the\r\nfollowing: Grate a Penny-Loaf into about a Pint of Water, and half as much\r\nClaret; then boil it thick, with two or three chips of Cinnamon, then\r\nsweeten it to your mind, as you please: strew some sifted raspings of Bread\r\nabout the Dish, and garnish with Lemon sliced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo dress a _Cow-Heel._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake out the Bones, and clean it, cut it to pieces, and wash it; then flour\r\nit, and strew over it a little Pepper and Salt, then fry it brown in\r\nHog's-Lard, made very hot in the Pan. Prepare at the same time some small\r\nOnions boiled whole, till they are tender, and pull off as many of the\r\nCoats or Skins, till you see them pure white; then make a Sauce of Gravey,\r\nsome White-Wine, Nutmeg, and a little whole Spice, with a little Salt and\r\nPepper, and thicken it with burnt Butter. Let your Onions, when they are\r\nskin'd, be made hot in Milk, and lay them whole in the Dish, with the\r\nCow-Heel, and pour the Sauce over the whole. Some who have strong Stomachs\r\nwill slice Onions, and flouring them well, fry them with with the Cow-Heel,\r\nbut this must be fry'd in Butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Marmalade_ of _Quinces._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake the large _Portugal_ Quinces, pare them, and take out the Cores; then\r\ncut each Quince in eight Parts, and throw them in Water; then boil the\r\nParings, and such of the Quinces as are of the worse sort, in two Quarts of\r\nWater, till the Liquor is reduced to half the quantity: when this is\r\nstrain'd, put the Liquor into your Preserving-Pan, with a Pound of fine\r\nSugar powder'd, with two Pounds of Quinces: boil these gently, till they\r\nare tender. Then if you design your Marmalade for mixing with Apples in\r\nPyes or Tarts, put to them a Pound more of Sugar to each two Pounds; break\r\nthem with a Spoon, and boil them briskly, keeping them stirring all the\r\nwhile: then put them hot into the Gally-pot, when they are thick, and of a\r\nreddish Colour. To heighten their redness, and keep them from burning to\r\nthe bottom, put into the Pan four or five pieces of pure Tin, as big as\r\nHalf-Crowns. But if you would have your Marmalade fine for Glasses, then,\r\nwhen they are boil'd tender, take them out of the Liquor, and beat them\r\nwell in a Marble Mortar, and rub them through a Sieve; then put to them a\r\nPound of fine Sugar, and stir them well in the Liquor; boil them quick,\r\nstirring them all the while, till they grow thick.\r\n\r\n_Memorandum_, While they are boiling the second time, put in some pieces of\r\nTin, as before, and when they are enough, pour them hot into your Glasses\r\nor Cups, first taking out the Pieces of Tin; and when your Marmalade is\r\ncool, cover your Glasses and Cups with white Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoil'd _Tench._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake Tench, fresh from the Pond, gut them, and clear them from their\r\nScales; then put them into a Stew-pan, with as much Water as will cover\r\nthem, some Salt, some whole Pepper, some Lemon-Peel, a stick of Horse\r\nRadish, a bunch of sweet Herbs, and a few Cloves; then boil them till they\r\nare tender, and when they are enough, take some of the Liquor, and put to\r\nit a Glass of White Wine, and a little Lemon-juice, or Verjuice, and an\r\nAnchovy shred. Then boil it a few Minutes, and thicken it with Butter\r\nrubb'd in Flour, tossing up a Pint of Shrimps with the Sauce, and pour it\r\nover the Fish. Serve it with garnish of fry'd Bread, cut the length of\r\none's Finger, some Slices of Lemon and Horse-Radish scraped, with some\r\npickled Mushrooms, if you will, or you may toss up some of them in the\r\nSauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo bake _Tench._ From Lady G.\r\n\r\nTake your Tench, fresh from the Pond, gut them, and clean them from the\r\nScales; then kill them, by giving them an hard stroke on the back of the\r\nHead, or else they will live for many Hours, and even jump out of the Pan\r\nin the Oven, when they are half enough. Then lay them in a Pan, with some\r\nMushroom Katchep, some strong Gravey, half a Pint of pickled Mushrooms, as\r\nmuch White-Wine as Gravey, three or four large Shallots, an Anchovy or two,\r\ntwo or three slices of fat Bacon, some Pepper, Cloves, and Nutmeg, at\r\npleasure, a little Salt, some Lemon-Peel, and a bunch of sweet Herbs; then\r\nbreak some bits of Butter, and lay them on your Fish, then cover all as\r\nclose as you can, and give them an Hour's baking.\r\n\r\nWhen they are enough, lay them in a hot Dish, and pour off the Liquor, and\r\nstrain it, only preserving the Mushrooms; then add to it a spoonful of\r\nLemon-Juice, and thicken your Sauce with the Yolks of four Eggs, beaten\r\nwith Cream, and mix'd, by degrees, with the Sauce. Pour this over your\r\nFish, and serve it hot with a Garnish of BeetRoots sliced, some slices of\r\nLemon-Peel, and some Horse-Radish scraped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo roast a _Westphalia-Ham._ From the same.\r\n\r\nBoil a Westphalia-Ham, as tender as it will be, with the Gravey in it; then\r\nstrip off the Skin, put it on a Spit, and having done it over with the Yolk\r\nof an Egg, strew it all over with raspings or chippings of Bread finely\r\nsifted, and mixt with a little Lemon-Peel grated. Baste it well when it is\r\nbefore the Fire, and drudge it frequently with the above Mixture till it is\r\nenough. Some, instead of Roasting it, will prepare it, with a good covering\r\nof the aforesaid Mixture, and set it an Hour in the Oven, which answers\r\nfull as well. Then serve it, with boiled Pidgeons, _Russia_ Cabbages, if\r\nyou can get them, or Sprouts of Cabbages, curll'd, as big as Tennis-Balls,\r\nor Collyflowers, or Brocoli. This is an excellent Dish, especially, if the\r\nCabbages, or Collyflowers, are toss'd up with Butter and Cream, but the\r\nBrocoli must only have the Butter pour'd over them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Neck of _Mutton_ and _Broth._ From _L. P._ Esq.\r\n\r\nThe Method of this Broth was first from a mistake, where instead of boiling\r\na Neck of Mutton, as directed, the Cook roasted it. The Gentleman was in a\r\nhurry for it, and call'd in half an Hour for his Neck of Mutton and Broth;\r\nbut the Cook had only that Neck in the House; which she was roasting, and\r\nwas then above half done: however, she takes it from the Spit, and cut it\r\nin pieces, which she presently set over the Fire, with the Gravey that came\r\nfrom it, with a small quantity of Water, and serv'd it up with some\r\nTurnips, as soon as possible. The Relish which the Meat had gain'd by\r\nroasting, gave the Broth so good a flavour, that it is recommended since\r\nthat time, by the Gentlemen who eat of it, where-ever they go; but with\r\nthis addition, that they take four or five _Hertfordshire_ Turnips, pare\r\nthem, and cut them in dice; then boil them in the Liquor with the half\r\nroasted Mutton; and when they are enough, take them out of the Liquor, and\r\ndraining them a little, flour them, and adding a little Salt, fry them\r\neither in Butter very hot, or in Hog's-Lard, and then serve them with\r\nPottage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoil'd _Venison,_ with its Furniture. From Mr. _L. L._\r\n\r\nTake an Haunch of Venison, salt it well, and let it remain a Week, then\r\nboil it, and serve it with a furniture of Collyflowers, _Russia_ Cabbages,\r\nsome of the _Hertfordshire_ Turnips cut in dice, and boiled in a Net, and\r\ntoss'd up with Butter and Cream, or else have some of the yellow _French_\r\nTurnips, cut in dice, and boil'd like the former; or we might add some red\r\nBeet-Roots boiled in dice, and butter'd in the same manner. Place these\r\nregularly, and they will afford a pleasant Variety both to the Eye and the\r\nTaste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Frogs,_ a white _Fricassee_ of them. From Mr. _Ganeau._\r\n\r\nTake large Frogs, and cut off the hinder Legs, strip them of the Skin, and\r\ncut off the Feet, and boil them tender in a little Veal-Broth, with whole\r\nPepper, and a little Salt, with a bunch of sweet Herbs, and some Lemon\r\nPeel. Stew these with a Shallot, till the Flesh is a little tender; then\r\nstrain off the Liquor, and thicken it with Cream and Butter; then serve\r\nthem hot with the Cream, and some Mushrooms pickled, toss'd up with the\r\nSauce, they make a very good Dish, and their Bones being of a very fine\r\nTexture, are better to be eaten than those of Larks. But we have in many\r\nPlaces an Aversion to them, as, in some others, some People have to\r\nMushrooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Frogs,_ in a brown _Fricassee._ From the same.\r\n\r\nPrepare the Frogs as before, and flour them well; then put them into a Pan\r\nof hot Lard, and fry them brown. Then take them and drain them from the\r\nLiquor they were fry'd in, and make a Sauce for them of good Gravey, some\r\nLemon-Peel, a Shallot or two, some Spice beaten, a bunch of sweet Herbs, an\r\nAnchovy, some pickled Mushrooms and their Liquor, and some Pepper and Salt.\r\nToss up these, thick with Butter, and pour the Sauce over them, putting\r\nfirst a little Claret to it, and some Lemon-Juice. Garnish with broiled\r\nMushroom-Flaps, and Lemon sliced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Snails,_ to be dressed with white Sauce. From the same.\r\n\r\nTake the large _German_ Snail, early in the Morning; put them, shells and\r\nall, into Salt and Water, for a few Hours, till they purge themselves: then\r\nput them into fresh Salt and Water, for a few Hours more, and repeat that a\r\nthird time, then give them a gentle boil in Water and. Salt, in their\r\nShells, and you may then pick them out, with a Pin, as you do Perwinkles,\r\nThen stew them in Veal-Broth, with some Cloves, a little Sack, some Mace,\r\nand a little Salt. Stew these a little while, and then pour over them this\r\nSauce thicken'd with Cream and Butter, and grate some Nutmeg upon the\r\nSauce, and serve them hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Snails,_ to be drest with brown Sauce. From the same.\r\n\r\nTake the same sort of Snail, as above mention'd, and clean it as before;\r\nthen give them one turn, when they are flour'd, in some hot Butter, or\r\nLard, and drain them. Then pour into the Pan, when, the Liquor is out, some\r\nstrong Gravey, a Glass of Claret, some Nutmeg, some Spices, and a little\r\nSalt, with a little Lemon-Peel grated; and when the Sauce is strong enough,\r\nthen strain the Sauce, and thicken it with burnt Butter. Then serve them up\r\nhot, with a Garnish of sliced Lemon, and some Sippits fry'd in Lard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA _Gammon_ of a _Badger_ roasted. From Mr. _R. T._ of _Leicestershire._\r\n\r\nThe Badger is one of the cleanest Creatures, in its Food, of any in the\r\nWorld, and one may suppose that the Flesh of this Creature is not\r\nunwholesome. It eats like the finest Pork, and is much sweeter than Pork.\r\nThen, just when a Badger is killed, cut off the Gammons, and strip them;\r\nthen lay them in a Brine of Salt and Water, that will bear an Egg, for a\r\nWeek or ten Days; then boil it for four or five Hours, and then roast it,\r\nstrewing it with Flour and rasped Bread sifted. Then put it upon a Spit, as\r\nyou did before with the _Westphalia_ Ham. Serve it hot with a Garnish of\r\nBacon fry'd in Cutlets, and some Lemon in slices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make minc'd Pyes, or _Christmas-_Pyes. From Mrs. _M. C._\r\n\r\nTake an Ox-Heart, and parboil it, or a Neat's-Tongue, boil'd without drying\r\nor salting, or the Inside of a Surloin of Beef; chop this small, and put to\r\neach Pound two Pounds of clean Beef-Suet, cleaned of the Skins and Blood,\r\nand chop that as small as the former; then pare, and take the Cores out of\r\neight large Apples, and chop them small, grate then a Two-penny-Loaf; and\r\nthen add two or three Nutmegs grated, half an Ounce of fresh Cloves, as\r\nmuch Mace, a little Pepper and Salt, and a Pound and a half of Sugar; then\r\ngrate in some Lemon and Orange-Peel, and squeeze the Juice of six Oranges,\r\nand two Lemons, with half a Pint of Sack, and pour this into the Mixture.\r\nTake care to put in two Pounds of Currans to every Pound of Meat, and mix\r\nit well; then try a little of it over the Fire, in a Sauce-pan, and as it\r\ntastes, so add what you think proper to it: put this in an earthen glaz'd\r\nPan, and press it down, and you may keep it till _Candlemas,_ if you make\r\nit at _Christmas._\r\n\r\n_Memorandum,_ When you put this into your Pyes, press it down, and it will\r\nbe like a Paste.\r\n\r\nWhen you take these Pyes out of the Oven, put in a Glass of Brandy, or a\r\nGlass of Sack or White Wine, into them, and stir it in them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plum-Pottage,_ or _Christmas-Pottage._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake a Leg of Beef, and boil it till it is tender in a sufficient quantity\r\nof Water, add two Quarts of red Wine, and two Quarts of old strong Beer;\r\nput to these some Cloves, Mace, and Nutmegs, enough to season it, and boil\r\nsome Apples, pared and freed from the Cores into it, and boil them tender,\r\nand break them; and to every Quart of Liquor, put half a Pound of Currans\r\npick'd clean, and rubb'd with a coarse Cloth, without washing. Then add a\r\nPound of Raisins of the Sun, to a Gallon of Liquor, and half a Pound of\r\nPrunes. Take out the Beef, and the Broth or Pottage will be fit for use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amber-Rum,_ from _Barbadoes;_ an extra-ordinary way of making it, from\r\nthat Country.\r\n\r\nTake the Preparation of the Scum and Dregs of the Sugar-Canes. Let them\r\nferment, and distil them with the Leaves of the _Platanus_, or Plain-Tree;\r\nthen put them into a Still again, and hang some Amber powder'd, in a Muslin\r\nBag, in the Cap of the Still, and let all the Steam pass through that, and\r\nit will be incomparable good Rum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA boiled _Goose_ with its Garniture. From the same.\r\n\r\nTake a young fat Goose, and salt it, and pepper it, for four Days or a\r\nWeek; then boil it as you would do other Victuals, till it is tender; then\r\ntake it from the Pot, and put about it some _Hertfordshire_ Turnips boiled,\r\nbeing first cut in dice, some Carrots boiled, and cut in dice, some small\r\nCabbage-Sprouts, some red Beet-Roots cut in dice, some _French_ yellow\r\nTurnips cut in dice, or such other Roots, or Herbs, as you like best.\r\nCollyflowers, if they are in season, will do well; but they must all be\r\ntoss'd up with Cream and Butter, except the _Hertfordshire_ Turnips, which\r\nshould, after they are boiled, be dry'd in a Cloth, and well flour'd; then\r\nfry them in hot Lard, or hot Butter, drain them well, and serve them with\r\nthe same Sauce.\r\n\r\n_Memorandum_, If you have any of the yellow _French_ Turnips, cut them in\r\ndice to boil, and when they are enough, treat them in the same manner as\r\nyou are directed, for the _Hertfordshire_ Turnips. Take care in the buying\r\nof the _Hertfordshire_ Turnips, for they are all white; but they require a\r\nlonger boiling than the red-ringed Turnips: the red-rings are soft\r\npresently, when they are good, and the others are near an Hour in boiling,\r\nand, even then, feel hard to the Spoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viper-Soup._ From Mr. _Ganeau._\r\n\r\nTake Vipers, alive, and skin them, and cut off their Heads; then cut them\r\nin pieces, about two Inches in length, and boil them, with their Hearts, in\r\nabout a Gallon of Water to eight Vipers, if they are pretty large. Put into\r\nthe Liquor a little Pepper and Salt, and a Quart of White Wine to a Gallon\r\nof Liquor; then put in some Spice, to your mind, and chop the following\r\nHerbs, and put into it: Take some Chervill, some white Beet-Cards or\r\nLeaves, some Hearts of Cabbage-Lettuce, a Shallot, some Spinach-Leaves, and\r\nsome Succory. Boil these, and let them be tender; then serve it up hot,\r\nwith a _French_ Roll in the middle, and garnish with the raspings of Bread\r\nsifted, and slices of Lemon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ketchup,_ in Paste. From _Bencoulin_ in the _East-Indies._\r\n\r\nThere is a Kidney-Bean, we have here, which has a fine relish in it, as the\r\n_Indians_ say, but in fact there is none but what they give it by Art. This\r\nBean, when it is full ripe, is taken out of the Shells, and boiled to a\r\nPulp, and that Pulp strain'd till it becomes like Butter; then they put\r\nsome of all the Spices into it, in Powder, as, Nutmeg, Cloves, Mace, and\r\nPepper, Garlick, and Orange-Juice, or some Mango Pickle. This being well\r\nmix'd together, makes an agreeable Sauce, when it is put in any warm\r\nLiquor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo dry Plums with Sugar. From Mr. _Girarde._\r\n\r\nTake large white or red Plums, such as the white _Holland's_-Plum, the\r\n_Bonum magnum_, the Royal Dolphin or Imperial Plum. Cut these, and take out\r\nthe Stones, and to every Pound of Plums, put three quarters of a Pound of\r\nSugar: boil your Sugar with a little Water, to a candy height; then put in\r\nyour Plums, and boil them gently on a slow Fire; then set them by to cool,\r\nand then boil them afresh, taking care that they do not break; then let\r\nthem lie in their Syrup, three or four Days, and then lay them upon Sieves,\r\nto dry, in a warm Oven, turning them upon clean Sieves, twice a day, till\r\nthey are dry. Then wash them off the clamminess of the Sugar with warm\r\nWater, and dry them again in the Oven; and when they are cold, put them up\r\nin Boxes, with Papers between them, and keep them in a dry Place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make small _Almond-Cakes._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake some Orange-Flower-Water, or Rose-Water, with about two Grains of\r\nAmber-Gris, and beat these with a Pound of blanched Almonds, in a Marble\r\nMortar; then take a Pound of fine Sugar powder'd, and finely sifted, and\r\nput most of it to the Almonds, when they are well beaten, and mix it well.\r\nThen make your Cakes, and lay them on Wafers, and set them in a gentle\r\nOven, on tin Plates; and when they are half baked, boil what Sugar you have\r\nleft, with some Rose-Water, to a candy height, and, with a Feather, wash\r\nthe Cakes over with this Liquor, and close your Oven, and let them stand a\r\nfew Minutes longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo preserve _Bullace._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake your Bullace before the Frost has taken them; let them be fresh\r\ngather'd, and clear Fruit, scald them in Water: then take their weight in\r\nfine Sugar, with a little Water, and boil it to a Syrup; then put in your\r\nBullace, and boil them till the Syrup is very thick, and your Fruit very\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nTo preserve green _Peaches._ From the same.\r\n\r\nIn some Gardens, where the Trees are pruned and ordered, by a skilful hand,\r\nit is often that a Tree will be so full of Fruit, that it is necessary to\r\ntake away some, when they are green, that the others may swell the better.\r\nAs this sometimes happens with Peaches, so I shall here direct how to\r\npreserve them. Scald your green Peaches in Water, then, with a Cloth, rub\r\nthe Down from them; then put them, in more Water, over a slow Fire, and let\r\nthem stew till they are green, keeping them cover'd. Then take their weight\r\nin fine Sugar, and with some Water, boil it to a Syrup, taking off the Scum\r\nas it rises; then put in your Peaches, and boil them till they are clear,\r\nand put them up, with the Syrup, in Glasses, or Gally-pots; and when they\r\nare cold, cover them with Paper. Note, You must gather your Peaches before\r\nthe Stone is hard in them, which you may know by putting a Pin through\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo preserve _Goosberries._ From the same.\r\n\r\nThe best Goosberries, for this Work, are the white _Dutch_ Goosberry, and\r\nthe Walnut-Goosberry. Take these, just when they are beginning to turn\r\nripe, pick off the Flower-tuft at the Ends, and stone them; then take to\r\nevery Pound of Fruit, one Pound and a quarter of fine Sugar beaten and\r\nsifted. Boil the Sugar with a little Water to a Syrup, taking off the Scum\r\nas it rises; then put in your Fruit, and boil them quick till they are\r\nclear, and put them in Glasses, boiling the Syrup a little more; then pour\r\nit upon them, and when it is cold, cover your Glasses close with Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo candy _Eringo-Roots._ From Mr. _Lufkin_ of _Colchester._\r\n\r\nTake the fairest Roots of Eringo, fresh taken out of the Ground, wash them\r\nclean, and boil them in several Waters till they are very tender: wash them\r\nagain, and rub them with a Cloth, to dry as much as they will bear, without\r\nbreaking, or bruising; slit them, and take out the Pith, and twist two\r\ntogether, like a Screw. Then take to every Pound of Root two Pounds of fine\r\nSugar powder'd, of which Sugar take one Pound at first, and boil it with\r\nsome Rose-Water, to a Syrup; and then put in your Roots, and boil them till\r\nthey are clear; then wet the rest of your Sugar with Rose-Water, and boil\r\nit to a candy Height; then put in the Roots, and let them boil, shaking\r\nthem often over the Fire, and when you think they are enough, take them\r\nfrom the Fire, and shake them till they are cold, and almost dry; then lay\r\nthem upon Dishes to dry thoroughly, and when they are done, put them up in\r\nBoxes with white Paper, under and over them, then keep them in a dry place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo preserve _Grapes_ in _Syrup._ From the same.\r\n\r\nThe best Grapes for this use, are those of the Fronteniac Kind, of which\r\nthere are the white and the blue, and the red, which seldom come to ripen\r\nin _England_, with their pure flavour. But as Heat is the occasion of\r\nripening; so, though they want it with us, from the Sun, we may make good\r\nthat deficiency by Fire, which will answer the end fully, and bring them to\r\nthe highest perfection of Taste, therefore the Sweet-meat made of these is\r\nexcellent; besides these Grapes for preserving, the _St. Peter_ and the\r\nWarner Grapes are very good, and I may mention the grizled Fronteniac,\r\nwhich is a noble Grape, when it is ripe, as well as the others. And for the\r\nother Sorts of Grapes, they are not fit for preserving, unless I take in\r\nthe Raisin Grapes, red and white, and the _Lombardy_ Grape; all which are\r\nfull of Pulp, and seldom ripen. These are your sorts, and now to proceed.\r\n\r\nTake your Grapes, gather'd in a dry Day, though they are not ripe. You may\r\nguess when we come to the end of _September_, and they are not so, they\r\nnever will be ripe: pick them then from the Stalks, and stone them\r\ncarefully, without breaking much of the Skin, save the Juice; then take the\r\nweight of them in fine Sugar powder'd, and boil your Sugar with some Water,\r\nwherein Pippins have been boiled before, first straining your Water, and\r\nboil them to Syrup, taking off the Scum as it rises. And when the Scum\r\nrises no more, put in your Grapes, and boil them quick till they are as\r\nclear as Crystal, I mean the white Grapes; but the red Sorts, let them boil\r\ntill they are clear, and that the Syrup will jelly; then put them into\r\nGlasses, and when they are cold, cover them close with white Paper; but\r\nmark your Papers, which are of the Fronteniac Kinds, for they will have a\r\nvery different Flavour from the other Sorts, an high richness that is much\r\nadmired. However, though the other Kinds of Grapes, mention'd in this\r\nReceipt, may want a flavour by themselves, you may add some Orange-Flower\r\nWater to the Syrup, you make for them, which will give them a fine taste.\r\n\r\n_N.B._ Take care that when you make this Preserve, you use only one sort at\r\none time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo dress a _Calf's-Head_ in a grand Dish. From Mrs. _E. Sympson._\r\n\r\nTake a large Calf's-Head, and divide it, cut off the Muzzle, and wash it\r\nwell; then take the Brains, and wash them, and dry them, and flour them,\r\nand put them in a Cloth, and tye them up. Boil these till they are half\r\ndone; then take them from the Kettle, and cut the Flesh off one side of the\r\nHead, in slices, like harsh'd Meat, and the other side of the Head must\r\nremain whole, and mark'd only with a sharp Knife, cross-ways. The Brains\r\nmust lie till the rest are prepared.\r\n\r\nTake then the harsh'd part, and with some of the Liquor it was boil'd in,\r\nput a Glass of White Wine, a little Mushroom Ketchup, a little Nutmeg\r\ngrated, and a little Mace beat fine, some Pepper and Salt, some grated\r\nLemon-Peel, and stew them together with a bunch of sweet Herbs, and some\r\nButter. When it is enough, put in a little Juice of Lemon, and thicken it\r\nwith Cream and Butter, in some of the same Liquor, with the Liquor of\r\nOysters parboil'd, a Pint of Oysters, and as many pickled Mushrooms, which\r\nmust be toss'd up with your Sauce, when you thicken it, remembring to cut\r\nthe Eye in pieces, amongst the Harsh.\r\n\r\nThen for the other side of the Head, when you have cut the Flesh cross\r\nways, in Diamonds, about an Inch over, beat the Yolks of two or three Eggs,\r\nand with a Feather past over it, cover it with the Yolks of Eggs, and then\r\ndrudge upon it the following Mixture.\r\n\r\nTake some Raspings of Bread sifted, put to them some Flour, a little Pepper\r\nand Salt, with some Mace and Nutmeg, in powder, and a little sweet Marjoram\r\npowder'd, or shred small. Mix these well together; then set it in an Oven,\r\nwith some bits of Butter upon it, till it is enough, or before a brisk\r\nFire, till the drudging is brown: this must be laid in the middle of the\r\nDish, and the Harsh round it. The Brains must be cut in pieces, and strew'd\r\nwith a little red Sage cut very small, and a little Spice and Salt; and\r\nthen every piece, dip'd in a thick Batter, made of Eggs, Flour, and Milk.\r\nFry these well in hot Hog's-Lard, or for want of that, in hot melted\r\nBeef-Suet; then take Oysters, a little stew'd in their own Liquor, with\r\nMace, and a little whole Pepper; take off their Fins, and dip them in the\r\nsame Batter, and fry them as directed above for the Brains. There must be\r\nlikewise some Pieces of Bread cut the length of one's Finger, and fry'd\r\ncrisp; all these are by way of Garnish. One may likewise boil some\r\nSkirret-Roots, and peel them, and then dip them in the Batter, and fry them\r\ncrisp. As for the other part of the Garnish, it must be red Beets pickled\r\nand sliced, and Lemon sliced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calf's-Head-_Pye. From the same.\r\n\r\nTake a large Calf's-Head, divide it, and when it is well cleaned, boil it\r\nhalf enough; then cut it in large slices, and slit the Eyes, season it with\r\nNutmeg, Pepper, Salt, and some powder of dry'd sweet Herbs; then lay it in\r\nyour Paste, with some Pepper and Salt, at the Bottom, with some bits of\r\nButter; then put in the Yolks of twelve hard Eggs, and a farced Meat made\r\nin the following manner. Take some Lean of Veal, shred it very small, then\r\ntake some Eggs butter'd, and a little Pepper and Salt, with other Spice\r\nbeaten, and some sweet Herbs in powder. Mix this with the Yolk or two of\r\nraw Eggs beaten, and make it into a Paste. Then roll it into Balls, and lay\r\na good number of them into the Pye, amongst the Meat; and, if you will, put\r\nin half a Pound of Currans well pick'd, and only rubb'd in a Cloth, without\r\nwashing. Then close your Pye, and just before it goes to the Oven, pour in\r\na Gill of White Wine, and half a Pint of Water; bake it and serve it hot,\r\nand you may add, if you will, the following Liquor, _viz._\r\n\r\nTake half a Pint of White Wine, and as much Water, with the Juice of a\r\nLemon. Boil these together a Minute or two, then take the Yolks of four\r\nEggs, and beat them well, a quarter of a Pound of Butter, and as much Sugar\r\nas you like to make it palatable. Then mix them well together, taking care\r\nthat it does not curdle, and pour it into your Pye just before you serve\r\nit.\r\n\r\n_Note_, One may put into this Pye, Cock's-Combs blanched, and some Citron\r\nor Lemon-Peel candy'd, if you design it for a sweet Pye; but it is very\r\ngood, whether we make it a sweet Pye or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo bake a _Calf's-Head._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake a Calfs-Head, wash it clean, and divide it; then beat the Yolks of\r\nfour or five Eggs, and beat them well, and with a Feather, trace that\r\nLiquor over the out-side of the Head, and strew over it some raspings of\r\nBread sifted, some Flour, some Pepper and Salt, some Mace and Nutmeg\r\npowder'd, with some sweet Herbs powder'd, with a little Sage shred small,\r\nand the Brains cut in pieces, and dip'd in thick Batter; then cover the\r\nHead with some bits of Butter, and pour in the Pan some White-Wine and\r\nWater, with as much Gravey, and cover it close. Then bake it in a quick\r\nOven, and when you serve it, pour on some strong Gravey, and garnish with\r\nLemon sliced, red Beet-Root pickled and sliced, and some fry'd Oysters, and\r\nfry'd Bread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make Spirit of _Lilley_ of the _Valley._ From _Norway._ N.B. This serves\r\nin the room of _Orange-Flower-Water,_ in 'Puddings, and to perfume _Cakes;_\r\nthough it is drank as a Dram in _Norway._\r\n\r\nGather your Lilley-of-the-Valley Flowers, when they are dry, and pick them\r\nfrom the Stalks; then put a Quarter of a Pint of them into a Quart of\r\nBrandy, and so in proportion, to infuse six or eight Days; then distil it\r\nin a cold Still, marking the Bottles, as they are drawn off, which is\r\nfirst, second and third, _&c_. When you have distill'd them, take the\r\nfirst, and so on to the third or fourth, and mix them together, till you\r\nhave as strong as you desire; and then bottle them, and cork them well,\r\nputting a lump of Loaf-Sugar into each Bottle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThings to be provided, when any great Family is going into the Country, for\r\na Summer. From Mr. _R. S._\r\n\r\n\r\nNutmegs.\r\nMace.\r\nCinnamon.\r\nCloves.\r\nPepper.\r\nGinger.\r\n_Jamaica_-Pepper.\r\nRaisins.\r\nCurrans.\r\nSugar _Lisbon._\r\nSugar-Loaf Lump.\r\nSugar double-refin'd.\r\nPrunes.\r\nOranges.\r\nLemons.\r\nAnchovies.\r\nOlives.\r\nCapers.\r\nOil for Salads.\r\nVinegar.\r\nVerjuice.\r\nTea.\r\nCoffee.\r\nChocolate.\r\nAlmonds.\r\nChesnuts.\r\n_French_ Pears.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir, I send you this as a _Memorandum_, because when some People go into\r\nthe Country, many of these Things may be forgot, and it is sometimes the\r\nCase, that one must send a Mile or two for what is wanted of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _I am Yours,_\r\n    R. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo salt a _Ham_ in imitation of _Westphalia,_ &c.\r\n\r\nTake an Ham of young Pork, and sprinkle it with Salt for one Day, that the\r\nBlood may come out; then wipe it dry, and rub it with the following\r\nMixture.\r\n\r\nTake a Pound of brown Sugar, a quarter of a Pound of Salt-Petre, half a\r\nPint of Bay-Salt, and three Pints of common Salt. Mix all these together,\r\nand stir them in an Iron Pan, over the Fire, till they are pretty hot, and\r\nthen rub your Ham with it. Turn your Ham often, and let it lie three Weeks;\r\nthen dry it in a Chimney with Deal Saw-Dust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make artificial _Anchovies._ From Mr. _James Randolph_ of _Richmond._\r\n\r\nAbout _February_ you will find, in the River of _Thames_, a large quantity\r\nof Bleak, or in _August_ a much larger parcel in Shoals. These Fish are\r\nsoft, tender, and oily, and much better than Sprats to make any imitation\r\nof Anchovies from. Take these, and clean them, and cut off their Heads, and\r\nlay them in an earthen glazed Pan, with a Layer of Bay-Salt under them, and\r\nanother over, a single Row of them; then lay a fresh row of Fish, and\r\nBay-Salt over that; and so continue the same _Stratum super Stratum_, till\r\nthe Vessel is full, and in a Month you may use them, and afterwards put\r\nVinegar to them. But they will be like Anchovies without Vinegar, only the\r\nVinegar will keep them. Turn them often the first Fortnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Apple-Dumplings_ in an extraordinary way. From Mrs. _Johnson._\r\n\r\nTake Golden-Rennets ripe, pare them, and take out their Cores; then cut the\r\nApples into small pieces, and with a large Grater, grate in a Quince, when\r\nit has been pared and cored: for if you was to slice in a Quince, to your\r\nApples, in large pieces, the Quince would not be boil'd equally with the\r\nApples; for the Quince is of a tough Nature, and will not boil under twice\r\nthe time that the Apples will: therefore to grate them, will be enough to\r\ngive their flavour to the Apple, and make all enough at one time. Put what\r\nSugar you think proper into each Dumpling, when you take it up, and the\r\nnecessary quantity of Butter. It will then cat like a Marmalade of Quince.\r\n\r\n_Note_, The Crust, or Paste, for these Dumplings, must be of a Puff-Paste\r\nmade with Butter, rubb'd into Flour, and for some other Parts of the\r\nButter, break them into the Paste, and roll them three times, and put in\r\nthe Apples to the Crust, tying them into a Cloth well flour'd, and boiling\r\nthem. It may be understood before, that when they are taken up hot, the\r\nCeremony of sugaring and buttering is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Apple-Dumplings_ made with Sweet-meats. From the same.\r\n\r\nTake fair Apples ripe, pare them, and take out the Cores; then slice them\r\nthin, and with a large Grater, grate in some candy'd Orange or Lemon-Peels,\r\nand you may put in also some powder'd Clove or Cinnamon, and a little\r\ngrated Quince, or Quince Marmalade. Put these together, the Apples being\r\nfirst cut in small pieces, into a Puff-Paste, and tye it up in a Cloth.\r\nThese must be sweeten'd with _Lisbon_-Sugar, when they are taken up, and\r\nmelted Butter pour'd in: for if you use Loaf-Sugar, though it is powder'd,\r\nsome of it will be harsh in the Mouth; and the _Lisbon_-Sugar, which is the\r\nfattest sort of Sugar, will not, but will give a good flavour to your\r\nFruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn _Hog_ barbecued, or broil'd whole. From _Vaux-Hall, Surrey._\r\n\r\nTake an Hog of five or six Months old, kill it, and take out the Inwards,\r\nso that the Hog is clear of the Harslet; then turn the Hog upon its Back,\r\nand from three Inches below the place where it was stuck, to kill it, cut\r\nthe Belly in a strait Line down to the Bottom, near the joining of the\r\nGammons; but not so far, but that the whole Body of the Hog may hold any\r\nLiquor we would put into it.\r\n\r\nThen stretch out the Ribs, and open the Belly, as wide as may be; then\r\nstrew into it what Pepper and Salt you please.\r\n\r\nAfter this, take a large Grid-Iron, with two or three Ribs in it, and set\r\nit upon a stand of Iron, about three Foot and a half high, and upon that,\r\nlay your Hog, open'd as above, with the Belly-side downwards, and with a\r\ngood clear Fire of Charcoal under it. Broil that side till it is enough,\r\nflouring the Back at the same time often. _Memorandum_, This should be done\r\nin a Yard, or Garden, with a Covering like a a Tent over it.\r\n\r\nWhen the Belly-part of the Hog is enough, and turn'd upwards, and well\r\nfix'd, to be steady upon the Grid-Iron, or Barbacue, pour into the Belly of\r\nthe Hog, three or four Quarts of Water, and half as much White-Wine, and as\r\nmuch Salt as you will, with some Sage cut small; adding the Peels of six or\r\neight Lemons, and an Ounce of fresh Cloves whole.\r\n\r\nThen let it broil till it is enough, which will be, from the beginning to\r\nthe end, about seven or eight Hours; and when you serve it, pour out the\r\nSauce, and lay it in a Dish, with the Back upwards. _Memorandum_, The Skin\r\nmust not be cut before you lay it on the Gridiron, to keep in the Gravey;\r\nneither should any of the Skin be cut, when you have any Pork roasted for\r\nthe same Reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beef,_ or _Pork,_ to be salted for boiling immediately, from the\r\n_Shambles._ From Mr. _J. P._ Chymist.\r\n\r\nTake any piece of Beef you desire to boil, or Pork for the same, dressing\r\nit fresh from the Shambles, or Market, and salt it very well, just before\r\nyou put it into the Pot; then as soon as your Meat is salted, take a coarse\r\nLinnen Cloth, and flour it very well, and then put the Meat into it, and\r\ntye it up close. Put this into a Kettle of boiling Water, and boil it as\r\nlong as you would any salt piece of Beef of the same bigness, and it will\r\ncome out as salt as a piece of Meat, that had been salted four or five\r\nDays: but by this way of salting, one ought not to have pieces of above\r\nfive or six Pounds weight. _N.B._ If to half a Pound of common Salt you put\r\nan Ounce of Nitre, or Salt-Petre, it will strike a redness into the Beef;\r\nbut the Salt-Petre must be beat fine, and well mix'd with the common Salt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Potatoe-_Puddings, made with Sweet-meats. From Mr. _Moring, Temple-Bar._\r\n\r\nTake some clean Potatoes, boil them tender, and when they are so, and clean\r\nfrom their Skins, break them in a Marble Mortar, till they become a Pulp;\r\nthen put to them, or you might beat with them some slices of candy'd Lemons\r\nand Oranges, and beat these together with some Spices, and Lemon-Peel\r\ncandy'd. Put to these some Marrow, and as much Sugar, with Orange-Flower\r\nWater, as you think fit. Mix all together, and then take some whole candy'd\r\nOrange-Peels, and stuff them full of the Meat, and set them upon a Dish, in\r\na gentle Oven; and when they have stood half an hour, serve them hot, with\r\na Sauce of Sack and Butter, and fine Sugar grated over them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Potatoe-_Pudding baked. From _Mr. Shepherd_ of _Windmill-Street._\r\n\r\nBoil some fair Potatoes till they are tender; then, when they are made\r\nclean, bruise them in a Marble Mortar, till they become a Paste, with some\r\nMace powder'd, some Sugar, and the Pulp of Oranges, with a _Naples_ Biscuit\r\nor two grated in, and a large Carrot grated. Add to these some Orange-Flower\r\nWater; and when all these are well mix'd, put to them some butter'd Eggs,\r\nwith some slices of Butter laid upon your Pudding, when it is put into the\r\nDish, or Pan. A little baking will serve for it; and when it is enough,\r\nserve it hot, with a garnish of sliced Lemon or Orange. Some will put this\r\ninto a Paste, but not cover it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make _Whipt Syllabubs._ From Mrs. _Cater_ of _Salisbury._\r\n\r\nTo a Pint of Cream put a Gill of Canary-Wine, and two Ounces of Loaf-Sugar\r\nfinely beat, and a slice or two of Lemon; then with a clean Whisk, whip it\r\ntogether, adding a little Milk, as it grows thick: then have your Glasses\r\nclean, and put into each of them three or four spoonfuls of any sorts of\r\nWine, red in some, and white in others, sweeten'd with fine Sugar powder'd;\r\nthen fill your Glasses with the Froth of your Cream, as it is whipt up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the fashionable Tables, for Persons of Rank, or Figure, where five\r\nDishes are serv'd at a Course. From _S.G._ Esq.\r\n\r\nThe Tables I shall speak of, are so order'd, as to save a great deal of\r\ntrouble to the Mistress of the Family, as well as to the Guests; for with\r\nthis Table every one helps himself, by turning any Dish he likes before\r\nhim, without interrupting any body. You must have first, a large Table with\r\nan hole in the Middle, of an Inch Diameter, wherein should be fix'd a\r\nSocket of Brass well turn'd, to admit of a Spindle of Brass, that will turn\r\neasily in it. The Table I speak of, may be, I suppose, five or six Foot\r\ndiameter; and then have another Table-board made just so large, that as it\r\nis to act on the Centre of the first Table, there may be near a foot\r\nvacancy for Plates, _&c._ on every side. Then fix the Spindle of Brass in\r\nthe Centre of the smaller Table, which Spindle must be so long, as, that\r\nwhen one puts it in the Socket of the great Table-board, the smaller\r\nturning Table may be about four Inches above the lower Board; so, that in\r\nits turning about, no Salt, or Bread, or any thing on the Places, may be\r\ndisturb'd. These Tables have Cloths made to each of them; the upper, or\r\nsmaller Table, to have an whole Cloth to cover it tight, and fasten'd\r\nclose, so that none of the Borders hang down; and the Cloth for the under\r\nTable, or great Table, must have an hole cut in the middle of it for the\r\nSpindle of the upper Table to pass thro' into the Brass Socket: and when\r\nthis is rightly order'd, and every necessary Furniture of the great, or\r\nlower Table, set by every Plate; then the upper Table, which will turn, may\r\nbe furnish'd with Meats. It remains only then, in some Places, for the Lady\r\nof the House, to offer the Soup; but after that, every one is at liberty to\r\nhelp themselves, by turning the upper Table about, to bring what they like,\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _I am Yours,_ S. G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Manner of killing and salting _Oxen,_ in the hottest Months, for the\r\nSea, that the _Beef_ may keep good. From a Contractor with the\r\nCommissioners of the _Royal-Navy._\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have often read your Books, and particularly your _Lady's Monthly\r\nDirector,_ relating to the Management of the several Products of a Farm,\r\nbut you have not taken notice of the Preservation of Flesh, as I expected.\r\n\r\nI send this therefore, to inform you, that upon the setting out of a Fleet\r\nin _June_, it was thought difficult to salt the Beef; but it was done, to\r\nfull Satisfaction, by the following Method.\r\n\r\nWe killed an hundred Oxen, in _June,_ towards the Close of the Evening, and\r\nlet them hang up whole, till the next Evening: then, when the Cool comes\r\non, cut out the Messes, and by every Stand have a Punchin of Brine, and\r\nthrow them into it as soon as they are cut, and in about three Minutes\r\nafter that, take them out, and salt them well. _Note_, These Pieces will by\r\nthese means lose their bloody Parts, in great measure, and be capacitated\r\nto receive the Salt much better than otherways, and then put them up.\r\n_Memorandum,_ We had not, out of all this quantity, above three Pieces\r\nfail'd, though the Weather was extreme hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cheshire-_Pye with _Pork._ From Mr. _R. J._\r\n\r\nTake some salt Loin of Pork, or Leg of Pork, and cut it into Pieces, like\r\nDice, or as you would do for an Harsh. If it be boiled or roasted, it is no\r\nmatter; then take an equal quantity of Potatoes, and pare them, and cut\r\nthem into dice, or in slices. Make your Pye-Crust, and lay some Butter, in\r\npieces, at the bottom, with some Pepper and Salt; then put in your Meat and\r\nPotatoes, with such seasoning as you like, but Pepper and Salt commonly,\r\nand on the Top some pieces of Butter. Then close your Pye, and bake it in a\r\ngentle Oven, putting in about a Pint of Water, just before it is going into\r\nthe Oven; for if you put in your Water over Night, it will spoil your Pye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo bake _Herrings_ in an extraordinary manner. From Mrs. _M. N._ of\r\n_Shrewsbury._\r\n\r\nTake fresh Herrings, and when they are scaled and cleaned, put them in a\r\nglazed earthen Vessel, where they can lie straight; then put in as much of\r\nthe following Liquor as will cover them, _viz._ an equal quantity of fine\r\npale and old strong Beer, with Vinegar, which is the best, or else all\r\nVinegar, or as some do, put two parts of Vinegar and one of Water; any of\r\nthese will do well. Then put in some Bay-Salt, such a quantity as you think\r\nwill season it to your mind, and to that a tenth part of Salt-Petre, which\r\nwill not make it salt, but give it a fine relish: to these put two or three\r\nBay-Leaves, a bunch of sweet Herbs, some Cloves, or _Jamaica_ Pepper, and\r\nsome whole Pepper; then cover your Pan, and bake it in a quick Oven, with\r\nBread. These must be eaten cold; they are excellent for a Country\r\nBreakfast, especially, if they are warm of the Spice, and if they are well\r\ndone, the very Bones will dissolve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo draw _Gravey_ for a private _Family._ From the same.\r\n\r\nTake some fleshy part of Beef, without Fat, and cut it in pieces about the\r\nbigness of Pidgeons Eggs; then flour it well, and put it in a Sauce-Pan,\r\nwith a little fresh Lard, or a little Butter, a little Onion sliced, some\r\nPowder of sweet Marjoram, and a little Pepper. Cover all close, and stir it\r\nnow and then till the Gravey is come out enough, and then pour on it some\r\nWater, when the Gravey is brown, and stir all together, and let them boil\r\nsome time; then strain it off, adding a little Lemon-Juice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother _Gravey,_ for a private Family, where there is not an opportunity\r\nof getting _Beef_ to make it of.\r\n\r\nTake some Butter, and some Onion, cut small, put it in a Sauce-Pan, and set\r\nit over the Fire till the Butter melts; then drudge in some Flour, and stir\r\nit well, till the Froth sinks down, and then it will be brown; you must\r\nthen have ready prepared the following Mixture to throw in, _viz._ some\r\ngood old Beer, and as much Water, an Onion cut small, some Pepper and Salt,\r\na small Anchovy shred, a little Lemon-Peel grated, a Clove or two, and, if\r\nyou have it, a little Mushroom Liquor, or Liquor of pickled Walnuts; then\r\nlet them all simmer together a little while, and it will produce a thick\r\ngood Gravey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Manner of Trussing a _Rabbit_ for Boiling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1]\r\n\r\nCut the two Haunches of the Rabbit close by the Back-Bone, two Inches, and\r\nturn up the Haunches, by the Sides of the Rabbit; skewer the Haunches\r\nthrough the lower Part of the Back, as at A; then put a Skewer through the\r\nutmost Joint of the Leg at B, and so through the Body, and through the\r\nother Leg, so that the end of the Leg reaches the Shoulder-Blade. Then\r\ntruss up the Shoulders high, and let the Pinnions be carried back, to take\r\nthe Legs at B, and lie between them and the Body; and under the height of\r\nthe Pinnions, put a Skewer, and bend the Neck backwards, and pass the\r\nSkewer through all, at C, so that it supports the Blade-Bone, and holds the\r\nHead up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Manner of Trussing a Single _Rabbit_ for Roasting. From Mr. _W. N._\r\nPoulterer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig, 2 ]\r\n\r\nYou case the Rabbit all, excepting the lower Joints of the four Legs, and\r\nthose you chop off: then pass a Skewer through the middle of the Haunches,\r\nafter you have laid them flat, as at A; and the Fore-Legs, which are called\r\nthe Wings, must be turn'd, as at B; so that the smaller Joint may be push'd\r\ninto the Body, through the Ribs. This, as a single Rabbit, has the Spit\r\npass'd through the Body and Head, but the Skewer takes hold of the Spit to\r\npreserve the Haunches. But to truss a couple of Rabbits, there are seven\r\nSkewers, and then the Spit passes only between the Skewers, without\r\ntouching the Rabbits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make a _Pheasant_ of a _Rabbit,_ truss'd in such a manner, that it will\r\nappear like a _Pheasant,_ and eat like one, with its Sauce. This is called,\r\nby the topping _Poulterers,_ a _Poland-Chicken,_ or a _Portugal-Chicken._\r\nBut it is most like a _Pheasant,_ if it is larded. From Mrs. _Johnson,_ at\r\nthe famous Eating-House in _Devereux-Court_ near the _Temple._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3]\r\n\r\nTake a young Rabbit full grown; case it all, excepting the Fore-Feet, chop\r\noff them, and the Head, as close as may be, but strip the Skin from the\r\nhind Legs, even to leave the Claws on them. These Claws are not unlike the\r\nClaws of a Pheasant, and some good Judges may be deceiv'd by their first\r\nLook, for they are little different from the Legs of the Fowls we design to\r\nimitate. Then turn the Neck-part of the Rabbit, the Breast inwards, to the\r\nScut or the Rump, leaving the Rump somewhat short, but to appear; then will\r\nthe Rabbit appear in the Shape above, _viz._ B is the Scut, or Rump, of the\r\nRabbit, and C is where the Neck comes; then will the Part mark'd F, appear\r\nlike the Breast of a Fowl: but you must put up the stript Legs of the\r\nRabbit, over each side of the Neck of it, and tie all together, with a\r\nString, as mark'd H H. So will the Hind-Legs of the Rabbit appear like the\r\nLegs of a Fowl, and where you see the Letter G mark'd, the Back of the\r\nRabbit is broken. D, is what represents the Back-Side of the Fowl, and E is\r\nthe Appearance of the Wings, which are supposed to be stuck into the Back,\r\nwhere two large Orifices are made, but the Bones of the Wings, of the\r\nRabbit, must be taken out. A, shews the Legs as they ought to be tied, and\r\nO O Directs to the Points of the Skewers which are to run through it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4]\r\n\r\nFig. 4. will shew you the Back of the same, when it is truss'd, with the\r\nAppearance of the Skewers, o, o, o, o, with the Orifices, wherein are the\r\nsupposed Bones of the Wings. If this is larded on the Breast, I think it\r\nbest, and it should be served with the following Sauce, if it is roasted.\r\n\r\nWhen this is thus prepared, you may stick a Pheasant's Tail-Feather at the\r\nScut, and roast it as you would do a Pheasant, basting it well with Butter,\r\nafter it is drudg'd well with Flour; then make the following Sauce for it.\r\nTake some strong Gravey, and put a little Lemon-Peel into it, with some\r\nSpice, and a little Wine; then take a few Buttons of Mushrooms pickled, and\r\nthicken it with burnt Butter, so that the Sauce becomes like one fit for a\r\nRagout, or _Ragoo_, as the _English_ pronounce it. Pour this over the Fowl\r\nor Rabbit, which you please to call it, and serve it hot, with a Garnish of\r\nLemon sliced, and pickled Red Beet-Roots sliced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Trussing a _Pidgeon._ From the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5]\r\n\r\nDraw it, but leave in the Liver, for that has no Gall; then push up the\r\nBreast from the Vent, and holding up the Legs, put a Skewer just between\r\nthe bent of the Thigh and the brown of the Leg, first having turn'd the\r\nPinnions under the Back: and see the lower Joint of the biggest Pinnions,\r\nare so pass'd with the Skewer, that the Legs are between them and the Body,\r\nas at A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA _Goose_ to Truss. From the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6]\r\n\r\nA Goose has no more than the thick Joints of the Legs and Wings left to the\r\nBody; the Feet, and the Pinnions being cut off, to accompany the other\r\nGiblets, which consist of the Head and Neck, with the Liver and Gizzard.\r\nThen at the bottom of the Apron of the Goose A, cut an hole, and draw the\r\nRump through it; then pass a Skewer through the small part of the Leg,\r\nthrough the Body, near the Back, as at B; and another Skewer through the\r\nthinnest part of the Wings, and through the Body, near the Back, as at C,\r\nand it will be right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Trussing of an _Easterling._ From Mr. _W. N._ Poulterer of St.\r\n_James's-_Market_, London._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig.7]\r\n\r\nA Duck, an Easterling, a Teal, and a Widgeon, are all trussed in the same\r\nmanner. Draw it, and lay aside the Liver and Gizzard, and take out the\r\nNeck, leaving the Skin of the Neck full enough to spread over the Place\r\nwhere the Neck was cut off. Then cut off the Pinnions at A, and raise up\r\nthe whole Legs, till they are upright in the middle of the Fowl B, and\r\npress them between the stump of the Wings, and the Body of the Fowl: then\r\ntwist the Feet towards the Body, and bring them forwards, with the bottom\r\nof the Feet towards the Body of the Fowl, as at C. Then take a Skewer, and\r\npass it through the Fowl, between the lower Joint, next the Foot, and the\r\nThigh, taking hold, at the same time, of the ends of the stumps of the\r\nWings A. Then will the Legs, as we have placed them, stand upright. D is\r\nthe point of the Skewer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Manner of Trussing a _Chicken_ like a _Turkey-Poult,_ or of Trussing a\r\n_Turkey-Poult._ From. Mr. _W. N._ Poulterer of St. _James's-_Market.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8]\r\n\r\nTake a Chicken and cut a long slit down the Neck, on the Fore-part; then\r\ntake out the Crop and the Merry-Thought, as it is call'd; then twist the\r\nNeck, and bring it down under the Back, till the Head is placed on the side\r\nof the Left-Leg; bind the Legs in, with their Claws on, and turn them upon\r\nthe Back. Then between the bending of the Leg and the Thigh, on the Right\r\nside pass a Skewer through the Body of the Fowl; and when it is through,\r\nrun the Point through the Head, by the same Place of the Leg, as you did\r\nbefore, as at A: you must likewise pull the Rump B through the Apron of the\r\nFowl. _Note,_ The Neck is twisted like a Cord, and the boney part of it\r\nmust be quite taken out, and the Under-Jaw of the Fowl taken away; neither\r\nshould the Liver and Gizzard be served with it, though, the Pinnions are\r\nleft on. Then turn the Pinnions behind the Back, and pass a Skewer through\r\nthe extreme Joint, between the Pinnion and the lower Joint of the Wing,\r\nthrough the Body, near the Back, as at C, and it will be fit to roast in\r\nthe fashionable manner. _N.B._ Always mind to beat down the Breast-Bone,\r\nand pick the Head and Neck clean from the Feathers before you begin to\r\ntruss your Fowl.\r\n\r\nA Turkey-Poult has no Merry-Thought, as it is called; and therefore, to\r\nimitate a Turkey the better, we take it out of a Chicken through the Neck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 9]\r\n\r\nFig. 9. Shews the Manner how the Legs and Pinnions will appear when they\r\nare turn'd to the Back; as also, the Position of the Head and Neck of the\r\nChicken, or Turkey-Poult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manner of Trussing an _Hare_ in the most fashionable Way. From Mr. _W.\r\nN._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10]\r\n\r\nCase an Hare, and in casing it, just when you come to the Ears, pass a\r\nSkewer just between the Skin and the Head, and by degrees raise it up till\r\nthe Skin leaves both the Ears stript, and then take take off the rest as\r\nusual. Then give the Head a Twist over the Back, that it may stand, as at\r\nA, putting two Skewers in the Ears, partly to make them stand upright, and\r\nto secure the Head in a right Disposition; then push the Joint of the\r\nShoulder-Blade, up as high as may be, towards the Back, and pass a Skewer\r\nbetween the Joints, as at B, through the bottom Jaw of the Hare, which will\r\nkeep it steady; then pass another Skewer through the lower Branch of the\r\nLeg at C, through the Ribs, passing close by the Blade-Bone, to keep that\r\nup tight, and another through the Point of the same Branch, as at D, which\r\nfinishes the Upper-Part. Then bend in both Legs between the Haunches, so\r\nthat their Points meet under the Scut, and skewer them fast, with two\r\nSkewers, as at O O.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Fowl trussed for Boiling. From Mr. _W. N._ Poulterer, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11]\r\n\r\nWhen it is drawn, twist the Wings till you bring the Pinnion under the\r\nBack; and you may, if you will, enclose the Liver and Gizzard, one in each\r\nWing, as at A, but they are commonly left out. Then beat down the Breast\r\nBone, that it does not rise above the fleshy Part; then cut off the Claws\r\nof the Feet, and twist the Legs, and bring them on the out-side of the\r\nThigh, towards the Wing, as at B, and cut an Hole on each side the Apron,\r\njust above the Sides-man, and put the Joints of the Legs into the Body of\r\nthe Fowl, as at C: so this is trussed without a Skewer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Truss a _Pheasant_ or _Partridge._ From the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12]\r\n\r\nBoth the Pheasant and Partridge are trussed the same way, only the Neck of\r\nthe Partridge is cut off, and the Neck and Head of the Pheasant is left on:\r\nthe Plate above shews the Pheasant trussed. When it is drawn, cut off the\r\nPinnions, leaving only the stump-bone next the Breast, and pass a Skewer\r\nthrough its Point, and through the Body near the Back, and then give the\r\nNeck a turn; and passing it by the Back, bring the Head on the outside of\r\nthe other Wing-Bone, as at A, and run the Skewer through both, with the\r\nHead landing towards the Neck, or the Rump, which you please: B is where\r\nthe Neck runs. Then take the Legs, with their Claws on, and press them by\r\nthe Joints together, so as to press the lower Part of the Breast, then\r\npress them down between the Sides-men, and pass a Skewer through all, as at\r\nC. Remember a Partridge must have its Neck cut off, or else in every thing\r\nis trussed like a Pheasant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo boil an artificial _Pheasant,_ with _Sellary._ From Mrs. _Johnson,\r\nDevereux-Court_ near _Temple-Bar._\r\n\r\nPrepare a Rabbit in the same manner as above directed, only it must not be\r\nlarded; then boil it, and give it the following Sauce. Take six or seven\r\nRoots of Sellary, and boil them, when they are well clean'd from Dirt, till\r\nthey are tender, then cut them into pieces of about two Inches long, and\r\ntoss them up with strong Gravey thicken'd with burnt Butter. Pour this over\r\nthe artificial Pheasant, and serve it hot, well impregnated with Spice.\r\nThen garnish it with Lemon sliced, or sliced Orange, and some fry'd Bread,\r\nand some Slices of pickled red Beet-Roots; or round the Edges of the Dish,\r\nstrew some sifted raspings of Bread.\r\n\r\n_THE END._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX TO PART
