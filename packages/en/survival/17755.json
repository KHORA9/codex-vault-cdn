CHAMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the idyls and historic or picturesque subjects that the Universal\r\nExposition gives us the occasion to publish, we thought we would make\r\na happy contrast by selecting a subject of a different kind, by\r\npresenting to our readers Mr. Layraud's fine picture, which represents\r\nthe gigantic power hammer used at the St. Chamond Forges and Steel\r\nWorks in the construction of our naval guns. By the side of the\r\nmachinery gallery and the Eiffel tower this gigantic apparatus is well\r\nin its place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNIVERSAL EXPOSITION--BEAUX ARTS--MARINE IRON AND STEEL\r\nWORKS AT SAINT CHAMOND--PRESENTATION OF A PIECE OF ORDNANCE UNDER THE\r\nVERTICAL HAMMER.--PICTURE BY M. JOSEPH LAYRAUD.]\r\n\r\nThe following is the technical description that has been given to us\r\nto accompany our engraving: In an immense hall, measuring 260 ft. in\r\nlength by 98 ft. in width, a gang of workmen has just taken from the\r\nfurnace a 90 ton ingot for a large gun for an armor-clad vessel. The\r\npiece is carried by a steam crane of 140 tons power, and the men\r\ngrouped at the maneuvering levers are directing this incandescent mass\r\nunder the power hammer which is to shape it. This hammer, whose huge\r\ndimensions allow it to take in the object treated, is one of the\r\nlargest in existence. Its striking mass is capable of reaching 100\r\ntons, and the height of the fall is 16 ft. To the left of the hammer\r\nis seen a workman getting ready to set it in motion. It takes but one\r\nman to maneuver this apparatus, and this is one of the characteristic\r\nfeatures of its construction.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of this hammer's operation, as well as the operations of\r\nthe forge itself, which contains three other hammers of less power,\r\ndates back to 1879. It is with this great hammer that the largest\r\ncannons of the naval artillery--those of 16 inches--have been made\r\n(almost all of which have been manufactured at St. Chamond), and\r\nthose, too, of 14, 13, and 12 inches. This is the hammer, too, that, a\r\nfew months ago, was the first to be set at work on the huge 13 in.\r\nguns of new model, whose length is no less than 52 ft. in the rough.\r\n\r\nLet us add a few more figures to this account in order to emphasize\r\nthe importance of the installations which Mr. Layraud's picture\r\nrecalls, and which our great French industry has not hesitated to\r\nestablish, notwithstanding the great outlay that they necessitated.\r\nThis huge hammer required foundations extending to a depth of 32 ft.,\r\nand the amount of metal used in its construction was 2,640,000 pounds.\r\nThe cost of establishing the works with all the apparatus contained\r\ntherein was $400,000.--_Le Monde Illustré._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORGING A PROPELLER SHAFT.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the recent visit of the Shah of Persia to England, he visited,\r\namong other places, the great works of John Brown & Co., at Sheffield,\r\nand witnessed the pressing of a propeller shaft for one of the large\r\nocean steamships. The operation is admirably illustrated in our\r\nengraving, for which we are indebted to the _Illustrated London News_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROPELLER SHAFT BEING PRESSED AT MESSRS.

MANUEL.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: A paper read before the Institute of Marine\r\n    Engineers, Stratford, 1889.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing asked to read a paper before your institute, I have chosen this\r\nsubject, as I think no part of the marine engine has given so much\r\ntrouble and anxiety to the seagoing engineer; and from the list of\r\nshipping casualties in the daily papers, a large proportion seem due\r\nto the shafting, causing loss to the shipowner, and in some instances\r\ndanger to the crew. My endeavor is to put some of the causes of these\r\ncasualties before you, also some of the remedies that have tended to\r\nreduce their number. Several papers have been read on this subject,\r\nchiefly of a theoretical description, dealing with the calculations\r\nrelating to the twisting and bending moments, effects of the angles of\r\nthe cranks, and length of stroke--notably that read by Mr. Milton\r\nbefore the Institute of Naval Architects in 1881. The only _practical_\r\npart of this paper dealt with the possibility of the shafts getting\r\nout of line; and regarding this contingency Dr. Kirk said that \"if\r\nsuperintendent engineers would only see that the bearings were kept in\r\nline, broken crank and other shafts would not be so much heard of.\" Of\r\ncourse this is one of those statements made in discussions of this\r\nkind, for what purpose I fail to see, and as far as my own experience\r\ngoes is _misleading_; for having taken charge of steamers new from the\r\nbuilders' hands, when it is at least expected that these shafts would\r\n_be in line_, the crank shaft bearings heated very considerably, and\r\n_continued_ to do so, rendering the duration of life of the crank\r\nshaft a short one; and though they were never what is termed out of\r\nline, the bearings could _not_ be kept cool without the use of sea\r\nwater, and occasionally the engines had to be stopped to cool and\r\nsmooth up the bearing surfaces, causing delays, worry, and anxiety,\r\nfor which the engineer in charge was in no way responsible. Happily\r\nthis state of what I might call _uncertainties_ is being gradually\r\nremedied, thanks being largely due to those engineers who have the\r\nskill to suggest improvements and the patience to carry them out\r\nagainst much opposition.\r\n\r\nThese improvements in many instances pertain to the engine builder's\r\nduties, and are questions which I think have been treated lightly;\r\nnotably that of insufficient bearing surface, and one of the principal\r\ncauses of hot bearings, whereby the oil intended for lubrication was\r\nsqueezed out, and the metal surfaces brought too close in contact; and\r\nwhen bearings had a pressure of 200 lb. per square inch, it has been\r\nfound that not more than 120 lb. per square inch should be exerted to\r\nkeep them cool (this varies according to the material of which the\r\nbearing is composed), without having to use sea water and prevent them\r\nbeing ground down, and thus getting out of line. I have known a\r\nbearing in a new steamer, in spite of many gallons of oil wasted on\r\nit, wear down one-eighth of an inch in a voyage of only 6,000 miles,\r\nfrom insufficiency of bearing surface.\r\n\r\nSeveral good rules are in use governing the strength of shafts, which\r\ntreat of the diameter of the bearings only and angles of the cranks;\r\nand the engine builder, along with the ship owner, has been chary of\r\nincreasing the surfaces by lengthening the bearings; for to do this\r\nmeans increase of space taken up fore and aft the vessel, besides\r\nadditional weight of engine. Engine builders all aim in competing to\r\nput their engines in less space than their rivals, giving same power\r\nand sometimes more. I think, however, this inducement is now more\r\ncarefully considered, as it has been found more economical to give\r\nlarger bearing surfaces than to have steamers lying in port, refitting\r\na crank shaft, along with the consequences of heavy bills for salvage\r\nand repairs, also the risk of losing the steamer altogether.\r\nProportioning the bearings to the weights and strains they have to\r\ncarry has also been an improvement. The different bearings of marine\r\nengines were usually made alike in surface, irrespective of the work\r\neach had to do, with a view to economy in construction.\r\n\r\nIn modern practice the after bearings have more surface than the\r\nforward, except in cases where heavy slide-valve gear has to be\r\nsupported, so that the wear down in the whole length of the shaft is\r\nequal, thus avoiding those alternate bending strains at the top and\r\nbottom of the stroke every revolution. Another improvement that has\r\nbeen successfully introduced, adding to the duration of life of crank\r\nshafts, is the use of white bearing metal, such as Parson's white\r\nbrass, on which the shafts run smoothly with less friction and\r\ntendency to heat, so that, along with well proportioned surfaces, a\r\nnumber of crank shafts in the Peninsular and Oriental Co.'s service\r\nhave not required lining up for eight years, and I hope with care may\r\nlast till new boilers are required. Large and powerful steamers can be\r\ndriven full speed from London to Australia and back without having any\r\nwater on the bearings, using oil of only what is considered a moderate\r\nprice, allowing the engineer in charge to attend to the economical\r\nworking of both engines and boilers (as well as many other engines of\r\nall kinds now placed on board a large mail and passenger steamer),\r\ninstead of getting many a drenching with sea water, and worried by\r\nclose attention to one or two hot bearings all the watch. Compare\r\nthese results with the following: In the same service in 1864, and\r\nwith no blame to the engineer in charge, the crank shaft bearings of a\r\nscrew steamer had to be lined up every five days at intermediate\r\nports, through insufficient bearing surfaces. Sea water had\r\ncontinually to be used, resulting in frequent renewal of crank shaft.\r\nSteamers can now run 25,000 miles without having to lift a bearing,\r\nexcept for examination at the end of the voyage. I would note here\r\nthat the form of the bearings on which the shafts work has also been\r\nmuch improved. They are made more of a _solid character_, the metal\r\nbeing more equally disposed _round_ the shaft, and the use of gun\r\nmetal for the main bearings is now fast disappearing. In large engines\r\nthe only metals used are cast iron and white brass, an advantage also\r\nin reducing the amount of wear on the recess by corrosion and grinding\r\nwhere sea water was used often to a considerable extent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1\r\n               Fig. 2]\r\n\r\nFigs. No. 1 and No. 2 show the design of the old and new main\r\nbearings, and, I think, require but little explanation. Most of you\r\npresent will remember your feelings when, after a hot bearing, the\r\nbrasses were found to be cracked at top and bottom, and the trouble\r\nyou had afterward to keep these brasses in position. When a smoking\r\nhot bearing occurred, say in the heating of a crank pin, it had the\r\neffect of damaging the material of the shaft more or less, according\r\nto its original soundness, generally at the fillets in the angles of\r\nthe cranks. For when the outer surface of the iron got hot, cold\r\nwater, often of a low temperature, was suddenly poured on, and the hot\r\niron, previously expanded, was suddenly contracted, setting up strains\r\nwhich in my opinion made a small tear transversely where the metal was\r\n_solid_; and where what is termed lamination flaws, due to\r\nconstruction, existed, these were extended in their natural direction,\r\nand by a repetition of this treatment these flaws became of such a\r\nserious character that the shafts had to be condemned, or actually\r\ngave way at sea. The introduction of the triple expansion engine, with\r\nthe three cranks, gave better balance to the shaft, and the forces\r\nacting in the path of the crank pin, being better divided, caused more\r\nregular motion on the shaft, and so to the propeller. This is\r\nspecially noticeable in screw steamers, and is taken advantage of by\r\nplacing the cabins further aft, nearer the propeller, the stern having\r\nbut little vibration; the dull and heavy surging sound, due to unequal\r\nmotions of the shaft in the two-crank engines, is exchanged for a more\r\nregular sound of less extent, and the power formerly wasted in\r\nvibrating the stern is utilized in propelling the vessel. In spite of\r\nall these improvements I have mentioned, there remains the serious\r\nquestion of defects in the material, due to variety of quality and the\r\nextreme care that has to be exercised in all the stages during\r\nconstruction of crank or other shafts built of iron. Many shafts have\r\ngiven out at sea and been condemned, through no other cause than\r\n_original defects_ in their construction and material.\r\n\r\nThe process of welding and forging a crank shaft of large diameter now\r\nis to make it up of so many small _pieces_, the _best shafts_ being\r\nmade of what is termed scrap, representing thousands of small pieces\r\nof selected iron, such as cuttings of old iron boiler plates,\r\ncuttings off forgings, old bolts, horseshoes, angle iron, etc., all\r\nwelded together, forged into billets, reheated, and rolled into bars.\r\nIt is then cut into lengths, piled, and formed into slabs of suitable\r\nsize for welding up into the shafts. No doubt this method is\r\npreferable to the old method of \"fagoting,\" so called, as the iron\r\nbars were placed side by side, resembling a bundle of fagots of about\r\n18 or 20 inches square.\r\n\r\nThe result was that while the outside bars would be welded, the inside\r\nwould be improperly welded, or, the hammer being weak, the blow would\r\nbe insufficient to secure the proper weld, and it was no uncommon\r\nthing for a shaft to break and expose the internal bars, showing them\r\nto be quite separate, or only partially united. This danger has been\r\nmuch lessened in late years by careful selection of the materials,\r\nimproved methods of cleaning the scrap, better furnaces, the use of\r\nthe most suitable fuels, and more powerful steam hammers. Still, with\r\nall this care, I think I may say there is not a shaft without flaws or\r\ndefects, more or less, and when these flaws are situated in line of\r\nthe greatest strains, and though you _may not_ have a hot bearing,\r\nthey often extend until the shaft becomes unseaworthy.\r\n\r\n[Diagrams shown illustrated the various forms of flaws.] These flaws\r\nwere not observable when the shafts were new, although carefully\r\ninspected. They gradually increased under strain, came to the outside,\r\nand were detected. Considerable loss fell upon the owners of these\r\nvessels, who were in no way to blame; nor could they recover any money\r\nfrom the makers of the shafts, who were alone to blame. I am pleased\r\nto state, and some of the members here present know, that considerable\r\nimprovement has been effected in the use of better material than iron\r\nfor crank shafts, by the introduction of a special mild steel, by\r\nMessrs. Vickers, Sons & Co., of Sheffield, and that instead of having\r\nto record the old familiar defects found in iron shafts, I can safely\r\nsay no flaws have been observed, when new or during eight years\r\nrunning, and there are now twenty-two shafts of this mild steel in the\r\ncompany's service.\r\n\r\nI may here state that steel was used for crank shafts in this service\r\nin 1863, as then manufactured in Prussia by Messrs. Krupp, and\r\ngenerally known as _Krupp's steel_, the tensile strength of which was\r\nabout 40 tons per square inch, and though free from flaws, it was\r\nunable to stand the fatigue, and broke, giving little warning. It was\r\nof too brittle a nature, more resembling chisel steel. It was broken\r\nagain under a falling weight of 10 cwt. with a 10 ft. drop = 12½ tons.\r\n\r\nThe mild steel now used was first tried in 1880. It possessed tensile\r\nstrength of 24 to 25 tons per square inch. It was then considered\r\nadvisable not to exceed this, and err rather on the safe side. This\r\nshaft has been in use eight years, and no sign of any flaw has been\r\nobserved. Since then the tensile strength of mild steel has gradually\r\nbeen increased by Messrs. Vickers, the steel still retaining the\r\nelasticity and toughness to endure fatigue. This has only been arrived\r\nat by improvements in the manufacture and more powerful and better\r\nadapted hammers to forge it down from the large ingots to the size\r\nrequired. The amount of work they are now able to subject the steel to\r\nrenders it more fit to sustain the fatigue such as that to be endured\r\nby a crank shaft. These ingots of steel can be cast up to 100 tons\r\nweight, and require powerful machines to deal with them. For shafts\r\nsay of 20 inches diameter, the diameter of the ingot would be about 52\r\ninches. This allows sufficient work to be put on the couplings, as\r\nwell as the shaft. To make solid crank shafts of this material, say of\r\n19 inches diameter, the ingot would weigh 42 tons, the forging, when\r\ncompleted, 17 tons, and the finished shaft 11¾ tons; so that you see\r\nthere is 25 tons wasted before any machining is done, and 5¼ tons\r\nbetween the forging and finished shaft. This makes it very expensive\r\nfor solid shafts of large size, and it is found better to make what is\r\ntermed a _built shaft_; the cranks are a little heavier, and engine\r\nframings necessarily a little wider, a matter comparatively of little\r\nmoment. I give you a rough drawing of the hydraulic hammer, or\r\nstrictly speaking a _press_, used by Messrs. Vickers in forging down\r\nthe ingots in shafts, guns, or other large work. This hammer can give\r\na squeeze of 3,000 tons. The steel seems to yield under it like tough\r\nputty, and, unlike the steam hammer, there is no _jarring_ on the\r\nmaterial, and it is manipulated with the same ease as a small hammer\r\nby hydraulics.\r\n\r\nThe tensile strength of steel used for shafts having increased from 24\r\nto 30 tons, and in some cases 31 tons, considering that this was 2\r\ntons above that specified, and that we were approaching what may be\r\ntermed _hard steel_, I proposed to the makers to test this material\r\nbeyond the usual tests, viz., tensile, extension, and cold bending\r\ntest. The latter, I considered, was much too easy for this fine\r\nmaterial, as a piece of fair iron will bend cold to a radius of 1½\r\ntimes its diameter or thickness, without fracture; and I proposed a\r\ntest more resembling the fatigue that a crank shaft has sometimes to\r\nstand, and more worthy of this material; and in the event of its\r\nstanding this successfully, I would pass the material of 30 or 31 tons\r\ntensile strength. Specimens of steel used in the shafts were cut off\r\ndifferent parts--crank pins and main bearings--(the shafts being built\r\nshafts) and roughly planed to 1½ inches square, and about 12 inches\r\nlong. They were laid on the block as shown, and a cast iron block,\r\nfitted with a hammer head ½ ton weight, let suddenly fall 12 inches,\r\nthe block striking the bar with a blow of about 4 tons. The steel bar\r\nwas then turned upside down, and the blow repeated, reversing the\r\npiece every time until fracture was observed, and the bar ultimately\r\nbroken. The results were that this steel stood 58 blows before showing\r\nsigns of fracture, and was only broken after 77 blows. It is\r\nnoticeable how many blows it stood after fracture. A bar of good\r\nwrought iron, undressed, of same dimensions, was tried, and broke the\r\nfirst blow. A bar cut from a piece of iron to form a large chain,\r\nafterward forged down and only filed to same dimensions, broke at 25\r\nblows. I was well satisfied with the results, and considered this\r\nmaterial, though possessing a high tensile strength, was in every way\r\nsuitable for the construction and endurance required in crank shafts.\r\n\r\nSheet No. 1 shows you some particulars of these tests:\r\n\r\n      Tensile    Elong.

Good       53         68       12\r\n\r\nI think all of the above tests show that this material, when carefully\r\nmade and treated with sufficient mechanical work on forging down from\r\nthe ingot, is suitable up to 34 tons for crank shafts; how much higher\r\nit would be desirable to go is a question of superior excellence in\r\nmaterial and manufacture resting with the makers. I would, however,\r\nremark that no allowance has been made by the Board of Trade or Lloyds\r\nfor the excellence of this material above that of iron. I was\r\ninterested to know how the material in the best iron shafts would\r\nstand this fatigue test compared with steel, and had some specimens of\r\nsame dimensions cut out of iron shafts. The following are the results:\r\nBest iron, three good qualities, rolled into flat bars, cut and made\r\ninto 4½ cwt. blooms.\r\n\r\n  J =  18.6   24.3 p. c.

Good   21   32   12\r\n\r\nYou will see from these results that steel stood this fatigue test,\r\nVickers' 73 per cent. and Steel Co.'s 68 per cent., better than iron\r\nof the best quality for crank shafts; and I am of opinion that so long\r\nas we use such material as these for crank shafts, along with the\r\npresent rules, and give ample _bearing surface_, there will be few\r\nbroken shafts to record.\r\n\r\nI omitted to mention that built shafts, both of steel and iron, of\r\nlarge diameter, are now in general use, and with the excellent\r\nmachines, and under special mechanics, are built up of five separate\r\npieces in such a rigid manner that they possess all the solidity\r\nnecessary for a crank shaft. The forgings of iron and steel being much\r\nsmaller are capable of more careful treatment in the process of\r\nmanufacture. These shafts, for large mail steamers, when coupled up,\r\nare 35 feet long, and weigh 45 tons. They require to be carefully\r\ncoupled, some makers finishing the bearings in the lathe, others\r\ndepend on the excellence of their work in each piece, and finish each\r\ncomplete. To insure the correct centering of these large shafts, I\r\nhave had 6 in. dia. recesses ¾ inch deep turned out of each coupling\r\nto one gauge and made to fit one disk. Duplicate disks are then fitted\r\nin each coupling, and the centering is preserved, and should a spare\r\npiece be ever required, there is no trouble to couple correctly on\r\nboard the steamer.\r\n\r\nThe propeller shaft is generally made of iron, and if made _not less_\r\nthan the Board of Trade rules as regards diameter, of the best iron,\r\nand the gun metal liners carefully fitted, they have given little\r\ntrouble; the principal trouble has arisen from defective fitting of\r\nthe propeller boss. This shaft working in sea water, though running in\r\nlignum vitæ bearings, has a considerable wear down at the outer\r\nbearings in four or five years, and the shaft gets out of line. This\r\nwear has been lessened considerably by fitting the wood so that the\r\ngrain is endway to the shaft, and with sufficient bearing surface\r\nthese bearings have not required lining up for nine years. It is,\r\nhowever, a shaft that cannot be inspected except when in dry dock, and\r\nhas to be disconnected from the propeller, and drawn inside for\r\nexamination at periods suggested by experience. Serious accidents have\r\noccurred through want of attention to the examination of this shaft;\r\nwhen working in salt water, with liners of gun metal, galvanic action\r\nensues, and extensive corrosion takes place in the iron at the ends of\r\nthe brass liners, more especially if they are faced up at right angles\r\nto the shaft. Some engineers have the uncovered part of the shaft\r\nbetween the liners, inside the tube, protected against the sea water\r\nby winding over it tarred line. As this may give out and cause some\r\ntrouble, by stopping the water space, I have not adopted it, and shall\r\nbe pleased to have the experience of any seagoing engineer on this\r\nimportant matter. A groove round the shaft is formed, due to this\r\naction, and in some cases the shaft has broken inside the stern tube,\r\nbreaking not only it, but tearing open the hull, resulting in the\r\nfoundering of the vessel. Steel has been used for screw shafts, but\r\nhas not been found so suitable, as it corrodes more rapidly in the\r\npresence of salt water and gun metal than iron, and unless protected\r\nby a solid liner for the most part of its length, a mechanical feat\r\nwhich has not yet been achieved in ordinary construction, as this\r\nliner would require to be 20 ft. long. I find it exceedingly difficult\r\nto get a liner of only 7 ft. long in one piece, and the majority of 6\r\nft. liners are fitted _in two pieces_. The joint of the two liners is\r\nrarely _watertight_, and many shafts have been destroyed by this\r\nmethod of fitting these liners.\r\n\r\nI trust that engine builders will make a step further in the fitting\r\nof these liners on these shafts, as it is against the interest of the\r\n_shipowner_ to keep ships in dry dock from such causes as defective\r\nliners, and I think it will be only a matter of time when the screw\r\nshaft will be completely protected from sea water, at least inside the\r\nstern tube; and when this is done, I would have no hesitation in using\r\nsteel for screw shafts. Though an easier forging than a crank shaft,\r\nthese shafts are often liable to flaws of a very serious character,\r\nowing to the contraction of the _mass_ of metal forming the coupling;\r\nthe outside cooling first tears the center open, and when there is not\r\nmuch metal to turn off the face of the coupling, it is sometimes\r\nundiscovered. Having observed several of these cavities, some only\r\nwhen the _last cut_ was being taken off, I have considered it\r\nadvisable to have holes bored in the end and center of each coupling,\r\nas far through as the thickness of the flange; when the shafts are of\r\nlarge size, this is sure to find these flaws out. Another flaw, which\r\nhas in many cases proved serious when allowed to extend, is situated\r\nimmediately abaft the gun metal liner, in front of the propeller.\r\n\r\nThis may be induced by corrosion, caused by the presence of sea water,\r\ngun metal, and iron, assisted by the rotation of the shaft. It may\r\nalso be caused under heavy strain, owing to the over-finishing of the\r\nshaft at this part under the steam hammer.\r\n\r\nThe forgemen, in these days of competition and low prices, are\r\ninstructed to so finish that there won't be much weight to turn off\r\nwhen completing the shaft in the lathe. This is effected by the use of\r\nhalf-round blocks under the hammer, at a lower temperature than the\r\nrest of the forging is done, along with the use of a little water\r\nflung on from time to time; and it is remarkable how near a forging is\r\nin truth when centered in the lathe, and how little there is to come\r\noff. The effect of this manipulation is to form a hard ring of close\r\ngrain about one inch thick from the circumference of the shaft inward.\r\nThe metal in this ring is much harder than that in the rest of the\r\nshaft, and takes all the strain the inner section gives; consequently,\r\nwhen strain is brought on, either in heavy weather or should the\r\npropeller strike any object at sea or in the Suez canal, a fracture is\r\ncaused at the circumference. This, assisted by slight corrosion, has\r\nin my experience led in the course of four months to a screw shaft\r\nbeing seriously crippled.\r\n\r\nI show you a section of a screw shaft found to be flawed, and which I\r\nhad broken under the falling weight of a steam hammer, when the\r\ndecided difference of the granules near the circumference from that in\r\nthe central part conveyed to me that it was weakened by treatment I\r\nhave referred to. I think more material should be left on the forging,\r\nand the high finish with a little cold water should be discontinued.\r\nDoing away with the outer bearing in rudder post is an improvement,\r\nprovided the bearing in the outer end of screw shaft in the stern tube\r\nis sufficiently large. It allows the rudder post to have its own work\r\nto do without bringing any strain on the screw shaft, and in the event\r\nof the vessel's grounding and striking under the rudder post, it does\r\nnot throw any strain on the screw shaft. It also tends to reduce\r\nweight at this part, where all the weight is overhung from the stern\r\nof the vessel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTAL AID IN THE DESIGN OF HIGH SPEED STEAMSHIPS.\r\n\r\nBy D. P.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe achievement of one triumph after another in the matter of high\r\nspeed steamships, and especially the confidence with which pledges of\r\ncertain results are given and accepted long before actual trials are\r\nmade, form one of the most convincing proofs of the important part\r\nwhich scientific methods play in modern shipbuilding. This is evident\r\nin the case of ships embodying novel or hitherto untried features, and\r\nmore especially so in cases where shipbuilders, having no personal\r\npractical experience or data, achieve such results. This was notably\r\nillustrated in the case of the Fairfield Co. undertaking some five\r\nyears ago to build and engine a huge craft of most phenomenal form and\r\nproportions, and to propel the vessel at a given speed under\r\nconditions which appeared highly impracticable to many engaged in the\r\nsame profession. The contract was proceeded with, however, and the\r\nCzar of Russia's wonderful yacht Livadia was the result, which\r\n(however much she may have justified the professional strictures as to\r\nform and proportions) entirely answered the designer's anticipations\r\nas to speed. Equally remarkable and far more interesting instances are\r\nthe Inman liners City of Paris and City of New York, in whose design\r\nthere was sufficient novelty to warrant the degree of misgiving which\r\nundoubtedly existed regarding the Messrs. Thomson's ability to attain\r\nthe speed required. In the case at least of the City of Paris, Messrs.\r\nThomson's intrepidity has been triumphantly justified. An instance\r\nstill more opposite to our present subject is found in the now\r\nrenowned Channel steamers Princess Henrietta and Princess Josephine,\r\nbuilt by Messrs. Denny, of Dumbarton, for the Belgian government. The\r\nspeed stipulated for in this case was 20½ knots, and although in one\r\nor two previous Channel steamers, built by the Fairfield Co., a like\r\nspeed had been achieved, still the guaranteeing of this speed by\r\nMessrs. Denny was remarkable, in so far as the firm had never\r\nproduced, or had to do with, any craft faster than 15 or 16 knots. The\r\nattainment not only of the speed guaranteed, but of the better part of\r\na knot in excess of that speed, was triumphant testimony to the skill\r\nand care brought to bear upon the undertaking. In this case, at least,\r\nthe result was not one due to a previous course of \"trial and error\"\r\nwith actual ships, but was distinctly due to superior practical skill,\r\nbacked and enhanced by knowledge and use of specialized branches in\r\nthe science of marine architecture. Messrs. Denny are the only firm of\r\nprivate shipbuilders possessing an experimental tank for recording the\r\nspeed and resistance of ships by means of miniature reproductions of\r\nthe actual vessels, and to this fact may safely be ascribed their\r\nconfidence in guaranteeing, and their success in obtaining, a speed so\r\nremarkable in itself and so much in excess of anything they had\r\npreviously had to do with. Confirmatory evidence of their success with\r\nthe Belgian steamers is afforded by the fact that they have recently\r\nbeen instructed to build for service between Stranraer and Larne a\r\npaddle steamer guaranteed to steam 19 knots, and have had inquiries as\r\nto other high speed vessels.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the power required for vessels of unusual types or of\r\nabnormal speed, where empirical formulæ do not apply, and where data\r\nfor previous ships are not available, the system of experimenting with\r\nmodels is the only trustworthy expedient. In the case of the Czar's\r\nextraordinary yacht, the Livadia, already referred to, it may be\r\nremembered that previous to the work of construction being proceeded\r\nwith, experiments were made with a small model of the vessel by the\r\nlate Dr. Tideman, at the government tank at Amsterdam. On the strength\r\nof the data so obtained, coupled with the results of trials made with\r\na miniature of the actual vessel on Loch Lomond, those responsible for\r\nher stipulated speed were satisfied that it could be attained. The\r\nactual results amply justified the reliance placed upon such\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nThe design of many of her Majesty's ships has been altered after\r\ntrials with their models. This was notably the case in connection with\r\nthe design of the Medway class of river gunboats. The Admiralty\r\nconstructors at first determined to make them 110 ft. long, by only 26\r\nft. in breadth. A doubt arising in their minds, the matter was\r\nreferred to the late Mr. Froude, who had models made of various\r\nbreadths, with which he experimented. The results satisfied the\r\nAdmiralty officers that a substantial gain, rather than a loss, would\r\nfollow from giving them much greater beam than had been proposed, and\r\nthis was amply verified in the actual ships.\r\n\r\nSo long ago as the last decade of last century, an extended series of\r\nexperiments with variously shaped bodies, ships as well as other\r\nshapes, were conducted by Colonel Beaufoy, in Greenland dock, London,\r\nunder the auspices of a society instituted to improve naval\r\narchitecture at that time. Robert Fulton, of America, David Napier, of\r\nGlasgow, and other pioneers of the steamship, are related to have\r\ncarried out systematic model experiments, although of a rude kind in\r\nmodern eyes, before entering on some of their ventures. About 1840 Mr.\r\nJohn Scott Russell carried on, on behalf of the British Association,\r\nof which he was at that time one of its most distinguished members, an\r\nelaborate series of investigations into the form of least resistance\r\nin vessels. For this purpose he leased the Virginia House and grounds,\r\na former residence of Rodger Stewart, a famous Greenock shipowner of\r\nthe early part of the century, the house being used as offices, while\r\nin the grounds an experimental tank was erected. In it tests were made\r\nof the speed and resistance of the various forms which Mr. Russell's\r\ningenuity evolved--notably those based on the well-known stream line\r\ntheory--as possible types of the steam fleets of the future. All the\r\ndata derived from experiment was tabulated, or shown graphically in\r\nthe form of diagrams, which, doubtless, proved of great interest to\r\nthe _savants_ of the British Association of that day. Mr. Russell\r\nreturned to London in 1844, and the investigations were discontinued.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that model experiments had been made by\r\ninvestigators long before the time of the late Dr. William Froude, of\r\nTorquay. It was not, however, until this gentleman took the subject of\r\nresistance of vessels in hand that designers were enabled to render\r\nthe results from model trials accurately applicable to vessels of full\r\nsize. This was principally due to his enunciation and verification by\r\nexperiment of what is now known as the \"law of comparison,\" or the law\r\nby which one is enabled to refer accurately the resistance of a model\r\nto one of larger size, or to that of a full sized vessel. In effect,\r\nthe law is this--for vessels of the same proportional dimensions, or,\r\nas designers say, of the same lines, there are speeds appropriate to\r\nthese vessels, which vary as the square roots of the ratio of their\r\ndimensions, and at these appropriate speeds the resistances will vary\r\nas the cubes of these dimensions. The fundament upon which the law is\r\nbased has recently been shown to have found expression in the works of\r\nF. Reech, a distinguished French scientist who wrote early in the\r\ncentury. There are no valid grounds for supposing that the discovery\r\nof Reech was familiar to Froude; but even were this so, it is\r\nabundantly evident that, although never claimed by himself, there are\r\nthe best of grounds for claiming the law of comparison, as now\r\nestablished, to be an independent discovery of Froude's.\r\n\r\nDr. Froude began his investigations with ships' models at the\r\nexperimental tank at Torquay about 1872, carrying it on\r\nuninterruptedly until his death in 1879. Since his decease, the work\r\nof investigation has been carried on by his son, Mr. R. E. Froude, who\r\nably assisted his father, and originated much of the existing\r\napparatus. At the beginning of 1886, the whole experimental appliances\r\nand effects were removed from Torquay to Haslar, near Portsmouth,\r\nwhere a large tank and more commodious offices have been constructed,\r\nwith a view to entering more extensively upon the work of experimental\r\ninvestigation. The dimensions of the old tank were 280 ft. in length,\r\n36 ft. in width, and 10 ft. in depth. The new one is about 400 ft.\r\nlong, 20 ft. wide, and 9 ft. deep. The new establishment is more\r\ncommodious and better equipped than the old, and although the\r\nexperiments are taken over a greater length, the operators are enabled\r\nto turn out results with as great dispatch as in the Torquay tank. The\r\nadjacency of the new tank to the dockyard at Portsmouth enables the\r\nAdmiralty authorities to make fuller and more frequent use of it than\r\nformerly. Since the value of the work carried on for the British\r\ngovernment has become appreciated, several experimental establishments\r\nof a similar character have been instituted in other countries. The\r\nDutch government in 1874 formed one at Amsterdam which, up till his\r\ndeath in 1883, was under the superintendence of Dr. Tideman, whose\r\nlabors in this direction were second only to those of the late Dr.\r\nFroude. In 1877 the French naval authorities established an\r\nexperimental tank in the dockyard at Brest, and the Italian government\r\nhave just completed one on an elaborate scale in the naval dockyard at\r\nSpezia. The Spezia tank, which is 500 ft. in length by about 22 ft. in\r\nbreadth, is fully equipped with all the special and highly ingenious\r\ninstruments and appliances which the scientific skill of the late Dr.\r\nFroude brought into existence, and have been since his day improved\r\nupon by his son, Mr. R. E. Froude, and other experts.\r\n\r\nThrough the courtesy of our own Admiralty and of Messrs. Denny, of\r\nDumbarton, the Italians have been permitted to avail themselves of the\r\nlatest improvements which experience has suggested, and the\r\nconstruction of the special machinery and apparatus required has been\r\nexecuted by firms in this country having previous experience in this\r\nconnection--Messrs. Kelso & Co., of Commerce Street, Glasgow; and Mr.\r\nRobert W. Munro, of London.\r\n\r\nHaving briefly traced the origin and development of the system of\r\nmodel experiment, it may now be of interest to describe the _modus\r\noperandi_ of such experiments, and explain the way in which they are\r\nmade applicable to actual ships. The models with which experiments are\r\nmade in those establishments conducted on the lines instituted by Mr.\r\nFroude are made of paraffin wax, a material well adapted for the\r\npurpose, being easily worked, impervious to water, and yielding a fine\r\nsmooth surface. Moreover, when done with, the models may be remelted\r\nfor further use and all parings utilized. They are produced in the\r\nfollowing manner: A mould is formed in clay by means of cross sections\r\nmade somewhat larger than is actually required, this allowance being\r\nmade to admit of the cutting and paring afterward required to bring\r\nthe model to the correct point. Into this mould a core is placed,\r\nconsisting of a light wooden framework covered with calico and coated\r\nwith a thick solution of clay to make it impervious to the melted\r\nparaffin. This latter substance is run into the space between the core\r\nand the mould and allowed to cool. This space, forming the thickness\r\nof the model, is usually from ¾ in. for a model of 10 ft. long to 1¼\r\nin. and 1½ in. for one of 16 ft. and 18 ft. long. When cold, the model\r\nis floated out of the mould by water pressure and placed bottom upward\r\non the bed of a shaping machine, an ingenious piece of mechanism\r\ndevised by the late Dr. Froude, to aid in reducing the rough casting\r\nto the accurate form. The bed of this machine, which travels\r\nautomatically while the machine is in operation, can be raised or\r\nlowered to any desired level by adjusting screws. A plan of water\r\nlines of the vessel to be modeled is placed on a tablet geared to the\r\nmachine, the travel of which is a function of the travel of the bed\r\ncontaining the model. With a pointer, which is connected by a system\r\nof levers to the cutting tools, the operator traces out the water\r\nlines upon the plan as the machine and its bed are in motion, with the\r\nresult that corresponding lines are cut upon the model. The cutting\r\ntools are swiftly revolving knives which work on vertical spindles\r\nmoved in a lateral direction (brought near or removed from each\r\nother), according to the varying breadth of the water lines throughout\r\nthe length of the model, as traced out by the operator's pointer. In\r\nthis way a series of longitudinal incisions are made on the model at\r\ndifferent levels corresponding to the water lines of the vessel. The\r\nmodel is now taken from the bed of the machine and the superfluous\r\nmaterial or projection between the incisions is removed by means of a\r\nspokeshave or other sharp hand tool, and the whole surface brought to\r\nthe correct form, and made fair and smooth.\r\n\r\nTo test accuracy of form, the weight of model is carefully taken, and\r\nthe displacement at the intended trial draught accurately determined\r\nfrom the plan of lines. The difference between the weight of model and\r\nthe displacement at the draught intended is then put into the bottom\r\nof the model in the form of small bags of shot, and by unique and very\r\ndelicately constructed instruments for ascertaining the correct\r\ndraught, the smallest error can at once be detected and allowed for.\r\nThe models vary in size from about one-tenth to one-thirtieth of the\r\nsize of the actual ship. A model of the largest size can be produced\r\nand its resistance determined at a number of speeds in about two days\r\nor so. The mode of procedure in arranging the model for the resistance\r\nexperiment, after the model is afloat in the tank at the correct\r\ndraught and trim, consists in attaching to it a skillfully devised\r\ndynamometric apparatus secured to a lightly constructed carriage. This\r\ncarriage traverses a railway which extends the whole length of the\r\ntank about 15 in. or 18 in. above the water. The floating model is\r\ncarefully guided in its passage through the water by a delicate\r\ndevice, keeping it from deviating either to the right or left, but at\r\nthe same time allowing a free vertical and horizontal motion. The\r\ncarriage with the model attached is propelled by means of an endless\r\nsteel wire rope, passing at each end of the tank around a drum, driven\r\nby a small stationary engine, fitted with a very sensitive governor,\r\ncapable of being so adjusted that any required speed may be given to\r\nthe carriage and model. The resistance which the model encounters in\r\nits passage through the water is communicated to a spiral spring, and\r\nthe extension this spring undergoes is a measure of the model's\r\nresistance. The amount of the extension is recorded on a revolving\r\ncylinder to a much enlarged scale through the medium of levers or bell\r\ncranks supported by steel knife edges resting on rocking pieces. On\r\nthe same cylinder are registered \"time\" and \"distance\" diagrams, by\r\nmeans of which a correct measure of the speed is obtained. The time\r\ndiagram is recorded by means of a clock attached to an electric\r\ncircuit, making contact every half second, and actuating a pen which\r\nforms an indent in what would otherwise be a straight line on the\r\npaper. The distance pen, by a similar arrangement, traces another line\r\non the cylinder in which are indents corresponding to fixed distances\r\nof travel along the tank, the indents being caused by small\r\nprojections which strike a trigger at the bottom of the carriage as it\r\npasses, and make electric contact. From these time and distance\r\ndiagrams accurate account can be taken of the speed at which the model\r\nand its supporting carriage have been driven. Thus on the same\r\ncylinder is recorded graphically the speed and resistance of the\r\nmodel. The carriage may be driven at any assigned speed by adjusting\r\nthe governor of the driving engine already alluded to, but the record\r\nof the speed by means of the time and distance diagrams is more\r\ndefinite. When the resistances of the model have been obtained at\r\nseveral speeds, varying in some cases from 50 to 1,000 feet per\r\nminute, the speeds are set off in suitable units along a base line,\r\nand for every speed at which resistance is measured, the resistance is\r\nset off to scale as an ordinate value at those speeds. A line passing\r\nthrough these spots forms the \"curve of resistance,\" from which the\r\nresistance experienced by the model at the given trial speeds or any\r\nintermediate speed can be ascertained. The resistance being known, the\r\npower required to overcome resistance and drive the actual ship at any\r\ngiven speed is easily deduced by applying the rule before described as\r\nthe law of comparison.--_The Steamship._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHIP IN THE NEW FRENCH BALLET OF THE \"TEMPEST.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA new ballet, entitled the \"Tempest,\" by Messrs.

One of the most important of the several tableaux exhibited\r\nis the last one of the third act, in which appears a vessel of unusual\r\ndimensions for the stage, and which leaves far behind it the\r\ncelebrated ships of the \"Corsaire\" and \"L'Africaine.\" This vessel,\r\nstarting from the back of the stage, advances majestically, describes\r\na wide circle, and stops in front of the prompter's box.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--SHIP OF THE \"TEMPEST,\" IN PROCESS OF\r\nCONSTRUCTION.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--SETTING OF THE SCENERY BEFORE AND AFTER THE\r\nAPPEARANCE OF THE SHIP.]\r\n\r\nAs the structure of this vessel and the mechanism by which it is moved\r\nare a little out of the ordinary, we shall give some details in regard\r\nto them. First, the sea is represented by four parallel strips of\r\nwater, each formed of a vertical wooden frame entirely free in its\r\nmovements (Fig. 2). The ship (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) is carried by\r\nwheels that roll over the floor of the stage. It is guided in its\r\nmotion by two grooved bronze wheels and by a rail formed of a simple\r\nreversed T-iron which is fixed to the floor by bolts. In measure as it\r\nadvances, the strips of water open in the center to allow it to pass,\r\nand, as the vessel itself is covered up to the water line with painted\r\ncanvas imitating the sea, it has the appearance of cleaving the waves.\r\nAs soon as it has passed, the three strips of water in the rear rise\r\nslightly. When the vessel reaches the first of the strips, the three\r\nother strips, at first juxtaposed against the preceding, spread out\r\nand thus increase the extent of the sea, while the inclined plane of\r\nthe preceding tableau advances in order to make place for the vessel.\r\nThe shifting of this inclined place is effected by simply pulling upon\r\nthe carpet that covers it, and which enters a groove in the floor in\r\nfront of the prompter's box. At this moment, the entire stage seems to\r\nbe in motion, and the effect is very striking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--SHIP OF THE NEW BALLET, THE \"TEMPEST.\"]\r\n\r\nWe come now to the details of construction of the vessel. It is not\r\nhere a question of a ship represented simply by means of frames and\r\naccessories, but of a true ship in its entirety, performing its\r\nevolutions over the whole stage. Now, a ship is not constructed at a\r\ntheater as in reality. It does not suffice to have it all entire upon\r\nthe stage, but it is necessary also to be able to dismount it after\r\nevery representation, and that, too, in a large number of pieces that\r\ncan be easily stored away. Thus, the vessel of the Tempest, which\r\nmeasures a dozen yards from stem to stern, and is capable of carrying\r\nfifty persons, comes apart in about 250 pieces of wood, without\r\ncounting all the iron work, bolts, etc. Nevertheless, it can be\r\nmounted in less than two hours by ten skilled men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--THE SHIP WITH ITS OCCUPANTS.]\r\n\r\nThe visible hull of the ship is placed upon a large and very strong\r\nwooden framework, formed of twenty-six trusses. In the center, there\r\nare two longitudinal trusses about three feet in height by twenty-five\r\nin length, upon which are assembled, perpendicularly, seven other\r\ntrusses. In the interior there are six transverse pieces held by\r\nstirrup bolts, and at the extremity of each of these is fixed a\r\nthirteen-inch iron wheel. It is upon these twelve wheels that the\r\nentire structure rolls.\r\n\r\nThere are in addition the two bronze guide wheels that we have already\r\nspoken of. In the rear there are two large vertical trusses sixteen\r\nfeet in height, which are joined by ties and descend to the bottom of\r\nthe frame, to which they are bolted. These are worked out into steps\r\nand constitute the skeleton of the immense stern of the vessel. The\r\nskeleton of the prow is formed of a large vertical truss which is\r\nbolted to the front of the frame and is held within by a tie bar. On\r\neach side of this truss are placed the _parallels_ (Figs. 1 and 3),\r\nwhich are formed of pieces of wood that are set into the frame below\r\nand are provided above with grooves for the passage of iron rods that\r\nsupport the foot rests by means of which the supernumeraries are\r\nlifted. As a whole, those rods constitute a jointed parallelogram, so\r\nthat the foot rest always remains horizontal while describing a curve\r\nof five feet radius from the top of the frame to the deck of the\r\nvessel. They are actuated by a cable which winds around a small\r\nwindlass fixed in the interior of the frame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--THE SHIP AS SEEN FROM THE STAGE.]\r\n\r\nThe large mast consists of a vertical sheath 10 ft. high, which is set\r\ninto the center of the frame, and in the interior of which slides a\r\nwooden spar that exceeds it by 5 ft. at first, and is capable of being\r\ndrawn out as many more feet for the final apotheosis. This part of the\r\nmast carries three footboards and a platform for the reception of\r\n\"supers.\" It is actuated by a windlass placed upon the frame.\r\n\r\nTo form the skeleton of the vessel there are mounted upon the frame a\r\nseries of eight large vertical trusses parallel with each other and\r\ncross-braced by small trusses. The upper part of these supports the\r\nflooring of the deck, and their exterior portion affects the curve of\r\na ship's sides. It is to these trusses that are attached the panels\r\ncovered with painted canvas that represent the hull. These panels are\r\nnine in number on each side. Above are placed those that simulate the\r\nnettings and those that cover the prow or form its crest.\r\n\r\nThe turret that surrounds the large mast is formed of vertical trusses\r\nprovided with panels of painted canvas and carrying a floor for the\r\nfigurants to stand upon.\r\n\r\nThe bowsprit is in two parts, one sliding in the other. The front\r\nportion is at first pulled back, in order to hide the vessel entirely\r\nin the side scenes. It begins to make its appearance before the vessel\r\nitself gets under way. Light silken cordages connect the mast, the\r\nbowsprit, and the small mast at the stern.\r\n\r\nOn each side of the vessel, there are bolted to the frame that\r\nsupports it five iron frames covered with canvas (Fig. 3), which reach\r\nthe level of the water line, and upon which stand the \"supers\"\r\nrepresenting the naiads that are supposed to draw the ship upon the\r\nbeach. Finally at the bow there is fixed a frame which supports a\r\ndanseuse representing the living prow of the vessel.\r\n\r\nThe vessel is drawn to the middle of the stage by a cable attached to\r\nits right side and passing around a windlass placed in the side scenes\r\nto the left (Fig. 2). It is at the same time pushed by machinists\r\nplaced in the interior of the framework. The latter, as above stated,\r\nis entirely covered with painted canvas resembling water.\r\n\r\nAs the vessel, freighted with harmoniously grouped spirits, and with\r\nnaiads, sea fairies, and graceful genii seeming to swim around it,\r\nsails in upon the stage, puts about, and advances as if carried along\r\nby the waves to the front of the stage, the effect is really\r\nbeautiful, and does great credit to the machinists of the Opera.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to _Le Genie Civil_ and _Le Monde Illustré_ for the\r\ndescription and engravings.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GIRARD HYDRAULIC RAILWAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nWe give herewith some illustrations of this railway which has recently\r\nexcited so much technical interest in Europe and America, and which\r\nthreatens to revolutionize both the method and velocity of traveling,\r\nif only the initial expense of laying the line can be brought within\r\nmoderate limits. A short line of railway has been laid in Paris, and\r\nwe have there examined it, and traveled over the line more than once;\r\nso that we can testify to the smoothness and ease of the motion. Sir\r\nEdward Watkin examined the railway recently, and we understand that a\r\nline two miles long is to be laid in London, under his auspices. He\r\nseems to think it might be used for the Channel tunnel, being both\r\nsmokeless and noiseless. It might also, if it could be laid at a\r\nsufficiently low price, be useful for the underground railways in\r\nLondon, of one of which he is chairman. We are favorably impressed by\r\nthe experiments we have witnessed; our misgivings are as to the cost.\r\nThe railway is the invention of the well known hydraulic engineer,\r\nMonsieur Girard, who, as early as 1852, endeavored to replace the\r\nordinary steam traction on railways by hydraulic propulsion, and in\r\n1854 sought to diminish the resistance to the movement of the wagons\r\nby removing the wheels, and causing them to slide on broad rails. In\r\norder to test the invention, Mons. Girard demanded, and at the end of\r\n1869 obtained, a concession for a short line from Paris to Argenteuil,\r\nstarting in front of the Palais de l'Industrie, passing by Le Champ de\r\nCourses de Longchamps, and crossing the Seine at Suresnes.\r\nUnfortunately, the war of 1870-71 intervened, during which the works\r\nwere destroyed and Mons. Girard was killed. After his death the\r\ninvention was neglected for some years. A short time ago, however, one\r\nof his former colleagues, Mons. Barre, purchased the plans and\r\ndrawings of Mons. Girard from his family, and having developed the\r\ninvention, and taken out new patents, formed a company to work them.\r\nThe invention may be divided into two parts, which are distinct, the\r\nfirst relating to the mode of supporting the carriages and the second\r\nto their propulsion. Each carriage is carried by four or six shoes,\r\nshown in Figs. 3, 4, and 5; and these shoes slide on a broad, flat\r\nrail, 8 in. or 10 in. wide. The rail and shoe are shown in section in\r\nFig. 1. The rail is bolted to longitudinal wooden sleepers, and the\r\nshoe is held on the rail by four pieces of metal, A, two on each side,\r\nwhich project slightly below the top of the rail. The bottom of the\r\nshoe which is in contact with the rail is grooved or channeled, so as\r\nto hold the water and keep a film between each shoe and the rail. The\r\ncarriage is supported by vertical rods, which fit one into each shoe,\r\na hole being formed for that purpose; and the point of support being\r\nvery low, and quite close to the rail, great stability is insured. It\r\nis proposed to make the rail of the form shown in Fig. 2 in future, as\r\nthis will avoid the plates, A, and the flanges, B, will help to keep\r\nthe water on the rail. Figs. 3, 4, and 5 show the shoe in detail. Fig.\r\n3 gives a longitudinal section, Fig. 4 is a plan, and Fig. 5 is a plan\r\nof the shoe inverted, showing the grooves in its face. Fig. 3 shows\r\nthe hollow shoe, into which water at a pressure of ten atmospheres is\r\nforced by a pipe from a tank on the tender. The water enters by the\r\npipe, C, and fills the whole of the chamber, D. The water attempts to\r\nescape, and in doing so lifts the shoe slightly, thus filling the\r\nfirst groove of the chamber. The pressure again lifts the shoe, and\r\nthe second chamber is filled; and so on, until ultimately the water\r\nescapes at the ends, E, and sides, F. Thus a film of water is kept\r\nbetween the shoe and the rail, and on this film the carriage is said\r\nto float. The water runs away into the channels, H H (Fig. 6), and is\r\ncollected to be used over again. Fig. 3 also shows the means of\r\nsupporting the carriage on the shoe by means of K, the point of\r\nsupport being very low. The system of grooves on the lower face of the\r\nshoe is shown in Fig. 5. So much for the means by which wheels are\r\ndispensed with, and the carriage enabled to slide along the line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nThe next point is the method of propulsion. Figs. 7 and 8 give an\r\nelevation and plan of one of the experimental carriages. Along the\r\nunder side of each of the carriages a straight turbine, L L, extends\r\nthe whole length, and water at high pressure impinges on the blades of\r\nthis turbine from a jet, M, and by this means the carriage is moved\r\nalong. A parabolic guide, which can be moved in and out of gear by a\r\nlever, is placed under the tender, and this on passing strikes the\r\ntappet, S, and opens the valve which discharges the water from the\r\njet, M, and this process is repeated every few yards along the whole\r\nline. The jets, M, must be placed at such a distance apart that at\r\nleast one will be able to operate on the shortest train that can be\r\nused. In this turbine there are two sets of blades, one above the\r\nother, placed with their concave sides in opposite directions, so that\r\none set is used for propelling in one direction and the other in the\r\nopposite direction. In Fig. 6 it is seen that the jet, M, for one\r\ndirection is just high enough to act against the blades, Q, while the\r\nother jet is higher, and acts on the blades, P, for propulsion in the\r\nopposite direction. The valves, R, which are opened by the tappet, S,\r\nare of peculiar construction, and we hope soon to be able to give\r\ndetails of them. Reservoirs (Fig. 6) holding water at high pressure\r\nmust be placed at intervals, and the pipe, T, carrying high pressure\r\nwater must run the whole length of the line. Fig. 6 shows a cross\r\nsection of the rail and carriage, and gives a good idea of the general\r\narrangements. The absence of wheels and of greasing and lubricating\r\narrangements will alone effect a very great saving, as we are informed\r\nthat on the Lyons Railway, which is 800 kilometers long, the cost of\r\noil and grease exceeds £400,000 per annum. As Sir Edward Watkin\r\nrecently explained, all the great railway companies have long tried to\r\nfind a substitute for wheels, and this railway appears to offer a\r\nsolution of that problem. Mons. Barre thinks that a speed of 200\r\nkilometers (or 120 miles) per hour may be easily and safely attained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\nOf course, as there is no heavy locomotive, and as the traction does\r\nnot depend upon pressure on the rail, the road may be made\r\ncomparatively light. The force required to move a wagon along the road\r\nis very small, Mons. Barre stating, as the result of his experiments,\r\nthat an effort amounting to less than half a kilogramme is sufficient\r\nto move one ton when suspended on a film of water with his improved\r\nshoes. It is recommended that the stations be placed at the summit of\r\na double incline, so that on going up one side of the incline the\r\nmotion of the train may be arrested, and on starting it may be\r\nassisted. No brakes are required, as the friction of the shoe against\r\nthe rail, when the water under pressure is not being forced through, is\r\nfound to be quite sufficient to bring the train to a standstill in a\r\nvery short distance. The same water is run into troughs by the side of\r\nthe line, and can be used over and over again indefinitely, and in the\r\ncase of long journeys, the water required for the tender could be taken\r\nup while the train is running. The principal advantages claimed for\r\nthe railway are: The absence of vibration and of side rolling motion;\r\nthe pleasure of traveling is comparable to that of sleighing over a\r\nsurface of ice, there is no noise, and what is important in town\r\nrailways, no smoke; no dust is caused by the motion of the train during\r\nthe journey. It is not easy for the carriages to be thrown from the\r\nrails, since any body getting on the rail is easily thrown off by the\r\nshoe, and will not be liable to get underneath, as is the case with\r\nwheels; the train can be stopped almost instantly, very smoothly, and\r\nwithout shock. Very high speed can be attained; with water at a\r\npressure of 10 kilogrammes, a speed of 140 kilometers per hour can be\r\nattained; great facility in climbing up inclines and turning round the\r\ncurves; as fixed engines are employed to obtain the pressure, there is\r\ngreat economy in the use of coal and construction of boilers, and\r\nthere is a total absence of the expense of lubrication. It is,\r\nhowever, difficult to see how the railway is to work during a long and\r\nsevere frost. We hope to give further illustrations at an early date\r\nof this remarkable invention.--_Industries._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUARTZ FIBERS.[1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Lecture delivered at the Royal Institution, on\r\n    Friday, June 14, by Mr. C. V. Boys, F.R.S.--_Nature._]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn almost all investigations which the physicist carries out in the\r\nlaboratory, he has to deal with and to measure with accuracy those\r\nsubtile and to our senses inappreciable forces to which the so-called\r\nlaws of nature give rise. Whether he is observing by an electrometer\r\nthe behavior of electricity at rest or by a galvanometer the action of\r\nelectricity in motion, whether in the tube of Crookes he is\r\ninvestigating the power of radiant matter, or with the famous\r\nexperiment of Cavendish he is finding the mass of the earth--in these\r\nand in a host of other cases he is bound to measure with certainty and\r\naccuracy forces so small that in no ordinary way could their existence\r\nbe detected, while disturbing causes which might seem to be of no\r\nparticular consequence must be eliminated if his experiments are to\r\nhave any value. It is not too much to say that the very existence of\r\nthe physicist depends upon the power which he possesses of producing\r\nat will and by artificial means forces against which he balances those\r\nthat he wishes to measure.\r\n\r\nI had better perhaps at once indicate in a general way the magnitude\r\nof the forces with which we have to deal.\r\n\r\nThe weight of a single grain is not to our senses appreciable, while\r\nthe weight of a ton is sufficient to crush the life out of any one in\r\na moment. A ton is about 15,000,000 grains. It is quite possible to\r\nmeasure with unfailing accuracy forces which bear the same relation to\r\nthe weight of a grain that a grain bears to a ton.\r\n\r\nTo show how the torsion of wires or threads is made use of in\r\nmeasuring forces, I have arranged what I can hardly dignify by the\r\nname of an experiment. It is simply a straw hung horizontally by a\r\npiece of wire. Resting on the straw is a fragment of sheet iron\r\nweighing ten grains. A magnet so weak that it cannot lift the iron yet\r\nis able to pull the straw round through an angle so great that the\r\nexistence of the feeble attraction is evident to every one in the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nNow it is clear that if, instead of a straw moving over the table\r\nsimply, we had here an arm in a glass case and a mirror to read the\r\nmotion of the arm, it would be easy to observe a movement a hundred or\r\na thousand times less than that just produced, and therefore to\r\nmeasure a force a hundred or a thousand times less than that exerted\r\nby this feeble magnet.\r\n\r\nAgain, if instead of wire as thick as an ordinary pin I had used the\r\nfinest wire that can be obtained, it would have opposed the movement\r\nof the straw with a far less force. It is possible to obtain wire ten\r\ntimes finer than this stubborn material, but wire ten times finer is\r\nmuch more than ten times more easily twisted. It is ten thousand times\r\nmore easily twisted. This is because the torsion varies as the fourth\r\npower of the diameter. So we say 10 × 10 = 100, 100 × 100 = 10,000.\r\nTherefore, with the finest wire, forces 10,000 times feebler still\r\ncould be observed.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore evident how great is the advantage of reducing the\r\nsize of a torsion wire. Even if it is only halved, the torsion is\r\nreduced sixteenfold. To give a better idea of the actual sizes of such\r\nwires and fibers as are in use, I shall show upon the screen a series\r\nof such photographs taken by Mr. Chapman, on each of which a scale of\r\nthousandths of an inch has been printed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Scale of 1000ths of an inch for Figs. 1 to 7. The scale\r\nof Figs. 8 and 9 is much finer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe first photograph (Fig. 1) is an ordinary hair--a sufficiently\r\nfamiliar object, and one that is generally spoken of as if it were\r\nrather fine. Much finer than this is the specimen of copper wire now\r\non the screen (Fig. 2), which I recently obtained from Messrs. Nalder\r\nBrothers. It is only a little over one-thousandth of an inch in\r\ndiameter. Ordinary spun glass, a most beautiful material, is about\r\none-thousandth of an inch in diameter, and this would appear to be an\r\nideal torsion thread (Fig. 3). Owing to its fineness, its torsion\r\nwould be extremely small, and the more so because glass is more easily\r\ndeformed than metals. Owing to its very great strength, it can carry\r\nheavier loads than would be expected of it. I imagine many physicists\r\nmust have turned to this material in their endeavor to find a really\r\ndelicate torsion thread. I have so turned only to be disappointed. It\r\nhas every good quality but one, and that is its imperfect elasticity.\r\nFor instance, a mirror hung by a piece of spun glass is casting an\r\nimage of a spot of light on the scale. If I turn the mirror, by means\r\nof a fork, twice to the right, and then turn it back again, the light\r\ndoes not come back to its old point of rest, but oscillates about a\r\npoint on one side, which, however, is slowly changing, so that it is\r\nimpossible to say what the point of rest really is. Further, if the\r\nglass is twisted one way first and then the other way, the point of\r\nrest moves in a manner which shows that it is not influenced by the\r\nlast deflection alone: the glass remembers what was done to it\r\npreviously. For this reason spun glass is quite unsuitable as a\r\ntorsion thread; it is impossible to say what the twist is at any time,\r\nand therefore what is the force developed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nSo great has the difficulty been in finding a fine torsion thread that\r\nthe attempt has been given up, and in all the most exact instruments\r\nsilk has been used. The natural cocoon fibers, as shown on the screen\r\n(Fig. 4), consist of two irregular lines gummed together, each about\r\none two-thousandth of an inch in diameter. These fibers must be\r\nseparated from one another and washed. Then each component will,\r\naccording to the experiment of Gray, carry nearly 60 grains before\r\nbreaking, and can be safely loaded with 15 grains. Silk is therefore\r\nvery strong, carrying at the rate of from 10 to 20 tons to the square\r\ninch. It is further valuable in that its torsion is far less than that\r\nof a fiber of the same size of metal or even of glass, if such could\r\nbe produced. The torsion of silk, though exceedingly small, is quite\r\nsufficient to upset the working of any delicate instrument, because it\r\nis never constant. At one time the fiber twists one way and another\r\ntime in another, and the evil effect can only be mitigated by using\r\nlarge apparatus in which strong forces are developed. Any attempt that\r\nmay be made to increase the delicacy of apparatus by reducing their\r\ndimensions is at once prevented by the relatively great importance of\r\nthe vagaries of the silk suspension.\r\n\r\nThe result, then, is this. The smallness, the length of period, and\r\ntherefore delicacy, of the instruments at the physicist's disposal\r\nhave until lately been simply limited by the behavior of silk. A more\r\nperfect suspension means still more perfect instruments, and therefore\r\nadvance in knowledge.\r\n\r\nIt was in this way that some improvements that I was making in an\r\ninstrument for measuring radiant heat came to a deadlock about two\r\nyears ago. I would not use silk, and I could not find anything else\r\nthat would do. Spun glass, even, was far too coarse for my purpose, it\r\nwas a thousand times too stiff.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nThere is a material invented by Wollaston long ago, which, however, I\r\ndid not try because it is so easily broken. It is platinum wire which\r\nhas been drawn in silver, and finally separated by the action of\r\nnitric acid. A specimen about the size of a single line of silk is now\r\non the screen, showing the silver coating at one end (Fig. 5).\r\n\r\nAs nothing that I knew of could be obtained that would be of use to\r\nme, I was driven to the necessity of trying by experiment to find some\r\nnew material. The result of these experiments was the development of a\r\nprocess of almost ridiculous simplicity which it may be of interest\r\nfor me to show.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus consists of a small crossbow, and an arrow made of straw\r\nwith a needle point. To the tail of the arrow is attached a fine rod\r\nof quartz which has been melted and drawn out in the oxyhydrogen jet.\r\nI have a piece of the same material in my hand, and now after melting\r\ntheir ends and joining them together, an operation which produces a\r\nbeautiful and dazzling light, all I have to do is to liberate the\r\nstring of the bow by pulling the trigger with one foot, and then if\r\nall is well a fiber will have been drawn by the arrow, the existence\r\nof which can be made evident by fastening to it a piece of stamp\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nIn this way threads can be produced of great length, of almost any\r\ndegree of fineness, of extraordinary uniformity, and of enormous\r\nstrength. I do not believe, if any experimentalist had been promised\r\nby a good fairy that he might have anything he desired, that he would\r\nhave ventured to ask for any one thing with so many valuable\r\nproperties as these fibers possess. I hope in the course of this\r\nevening to show that I am not exaggerating their merits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\nIn the first place, let me say something about the degree of fineness\r\nto which they can be drawn. There is now projected upon the screen a\r\nquartz fiber one five-thousandth of an inch in diameter (Fig. 6). This\r\nis one which I had in constant use in an instrument loaded with about\r\n30 grains. It has a section only one-sixth of that of a single line of\r\nsilk, and it is just as strong. Not being organic, it is in no way\r\naffected by changes of moisture and temperature, and so it is free\r\nfrom the vagaries of silk which give so much trouble. The piece used\r\nin the instrument was about 16 inches long. Had it been necessary to\r\nemploy spun glass, which hitherto was the finest torsion material,\r\nthen, instead of 16 inches, I should have required a piece 1,000 feet\r\nlong, and an instrument as high as the Eiffel tower to put it in.\r\n\r\nThere is no difficulty in obtaining pieces as fine as this yards long\r\nif required, or in spinning it very much finer. There is upon the\r\nscreen a single line made by the small garden spider, and the size of\r\nthis is perfectly evident (Fig. 7). You now see a quartz fiber far\r\nfiner than this, or, rather, you see a diffraction phenomenon, for no\r\ntrue image is formed at all; but even this is a conspicuous object in\r\ncomparison with the tapering ends, which it is absolutely impossible\r\nto trace in a microscope. The next two photographs, taken by Mr.\r\nNelson, whose skill and resources are so famous, represent the extreme\r\nend of a tail of quartz, and, though the scale is a great deal larger\r\nthan that used in the other photographs, the end will be visible only\r\nto a few. Mr. Nelson has photographed here what it is absolutely\r\nimpossible to see. What the size of these ends may be, I have no means\r\nof telling. Dr. Royston Piggott has estimated some of them at less\r\nthan one-millionth of an inch, but, whatever they are, they supply for\r\nthe first time objects of extreme smallness the form of which is\r\ncertainly known, and, therefore, I cannot help looking upon them as\r\nmore satisfactory tests for the microscope than diatoms and other\r\nthings of the real shape of which we know nothing whatever.\r\n\r\nSince figures as large as a million cannot be realized properly, it\r\nmay be worth while to give an illustration of what is meant by a fiber\r\none-millionth of an inch in diameter.\r\n\r\nA piece of quartz an inch long and an inch in diameter would, if drawn\r\nout to this degree of fineness, be sufficient to go all the way round\r\nthe world 658 times; or a grain of sand just visible--that is,\r\none-hundredth of an inch long and one hundredth of an inch in\r\ndiameter--would make one thousand miles of such thread. Further, the\r\npressure inside such a thread due to a surface tension equal to that\r\nof water would be 60 atmospheres.\r\n\r\nGoing back to such threads as can be used in instruments, I have made\r\nuse of fibers one ten-thousandth of an inch in diameter, and in these\r\nthe torsion is 10,000 times less than that of spun glass.\r\n\r\nAs these fibers are made finer their strength increases in proportion\r\nto their size, and surpasses that of ordinary bar steel, reaching, to\r\nuse the language of engineers, as high a figure as 80 tons to the\r\ninch. Fibers of ordinary size have a strength of 50 tons to the inch.\r\n\r\nWhile it is evident that these fibers give us the means of producing\r\nan exceedingly small torsion, and one that is not affected by weather,\r\nit is not yet evident that they may not show the same fatigue that\r\nmakes spun glass useless. I have, therefore, a duplicate apparatus\r\nwith a quartz fiber, and you will see that the spot of light comes\r\nback to its true place on the screen after the mirror has been twisted\r\nround twice.\r\n\r\nI shall now for a moment draw your attention to that peculiar property\r\nof melted quartz that makes threads such as I have been describing a\r\npossibility. A liquid cylinder, as Plateau has so beautifully shown,\r\nis an unstable form. It can no more exist than can a pencil stand on\r\nits point. It immediately breaks up into a series of spheres. This is\r\nwell illustrated in that very ancient experiment of shooting threads\r\nof resin electrically. When the resin is hot, the liquid cylinders,\r\nwhich are projected in all directions, break up into spheres, as you\r\nsee now upon the screen. As the resin cools, they begin to develop\r\ntails; and when it is cool enough, i.e., sufficiently viscous, the\r\ntails thicken and the beads become less, and at last uniform threads\r\nare the result. The series of photographs show this well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\nThere is a far more perfect illustration which we have only to go into\r\nthe garden to find. There we may see in abundance what is now upon the\r\nscreen--the webs of those beautiful geometrical spiders. The radial\r\nthreads are smooth like the one you saw a few minutes ago, but the\r\nthreads that go round and round are beaded. The spider draws these\r\nwebs slowly, and at the same time pours upon them a liquid, and still\r\nfurther to obtain the effect of launching a liquid cylinder in space\r\nhe, or rather she, pulls it out like the string of a bow, and lets it\r\ngo with a jerk. The liquid cylinder cannot exist, and the result is\r\nwhat you now see upon the screen (Fig. 8). A more perfect illustration\r\nof the regular breaking up of a liquid cylinder it would be impossible\r\nto find. The beads are, as Plateau showed they ought to be,\r\nalternately large and small, and their regularity is marvelous.\r\nSometimes two still smaller beads are developed, as may be seen in the\r\nsecond photograph, thus completely agreeing with the results of\r\nPlateau's investigations.\r\n\r\nI have heard it maintained that the spider goes round her web and\r\nplaces these beads there afterward. But since a web with about 360,000\r\nbeads is completed in an hour--that is at the rate of about 100 a\r\nsecond--this does not seem likely. That what I have said is true, is\r\nmade more probable by the photograph of a beaded web that I have made\r\nmyself by simply stroking a quartz fiber with a straw wetted with\r\ncastor oil (Fig. 9); it is rather larger than a spider line; but I\r\nhave made beaded threads, using a fine fiber, quite indistinguishable\r\nfrom a real spider web, and they have the further similarity that they\r\nare just as good for catching flies.\r\n\r\nNow, going back to the melted quartz, it is evident that if it ever\r\nbecame perfectly liquid, it could not exist as a fiber for an instant.\r\nIt is the extreme viscosity of quartz, at the heat even of an electric\r\narc, that makes these fibers possible. The only difference between\r\nquartz in the oxyhydrogen jet and quartz in the arc is that in the\r\nfirst you make threads and in the second are blown bubbles. I have in\r\nmy hand some microscopic bubbles of quartz showing all the perfection\r\nof form and color that we are familiar with in the soap bubble.\r\n\r\nAn invaluable property of quartz is its power of insulating perfectly,\r\neven in an atmosphere saturated with water. The gold leaves now\r\ndiverging were charged some time before the lecture, and hardly show\r\nany change, yet the insulator is a rod of quartz only three-quarters\r\nof an inch long, and the air is kept moist by a dish of water. The\r\nquartz may even be dipped in the water and replaced with the water\r\nupon it without any difference in the insulation being observed.\r\n\r\nNot only can fibers be made of extreme fineness, but they are\r\nwonderfully uniform in diameter. So uniform are they that they\r\nperfectly stand an optical test so severe that irregularities\r\ninvisible in any microscope would immediately be made apparent. Every\r\none must have noticed when the sun is shining upon a border of flowers\r\nand shrubs how the lines which spiders use as railways to travel from\r\nplace to place glisten with brilliant colors. These colors are only\r\nproduced when the fibers are sufficiently fine. If you take one of\r\nthese webs and examine it in the sunlight, you will find that the\r\ncolors are variegated, and the effect, consequently, is one of great\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nA quartz fiber of about the same size shows colors in the same way,\r\nbut the tint is perfectly uniform on the fiber. If the color of the\r\nfiber is examined with a prism, the spectrum is found to consist of\r\nalternate bright and dark bands. Upon the screen are photographs\r\ntaken by Mr. Briscoe, a student in the laboratory at South Kensington,\r\nof the spectra of some of these fibers at different angles of\r\nincidence. It will be seen that coarse fibers have more bands than\r\nfine, and that the number increases with the angle of incidence of the\r\nlight. There are peculiarities in the march of the bands as the angle\r\nincreases which I cannot describe now. I may only say that they appear\r\nto move not uniformly, but in waves, presenting very much the\r\nappearance of a caterpillar walking.\r\n\r\nSo uniform are the quartz fibers that the spectrum from end to end\r\nconsists of parallel bands. Occasionally a fiber is found which\r\npresents a slight irregularity here and there. A spider line is so\r\nirregular that these bands are hardly observable; but, as the\r\nphotograph on the screen shows, it is possible to trace them running\r\nup and down the spectrum when you know what to look for.\r\n\r\nTo show that these longitudinal bands are due to the irregularities, I\r\nhave drawn a taper piece of quartz by hand, in which the two edges\r\nmake with one another an almost imperceptible angle, and the spectrum\r\nof this shows the gradual change of diameter by the very steep angle\r\nat which the bands run up the spectrum.\r\n\r\nInto the theory of the development of these bands I am unable to\r\nenter; that is a subject on which your professor of natural philosophy\r\nis best able to speak. Perhaps I may venture to express the hope, as\r\nthe experimental investigation of this subject is now rendered\r\npossible, that he may be induced to carry out a research for which he\r\nis so eminently fitted.\r\n\r\nThough this is a subject which is altogether beyond me, I have been\r\nable to use the results in a practical way. When it is required to\r\nplace into an instrument a fiber of any particular size, all that has\r\nto be done is to hold the frame of fibers toward a bright and distant\r\nlight, and look at them through a low-angled prism. The banded spectra\r\nare then visible, and it is the work of a moment to pick out one with\r\nthe number of bands that has been found to be given by a fiber of the\r\ndesired size. A coarse fiber may have a dozen or more, while such\r\nfibers as I find most useful have only two dark bands. Much finer ones\r\nexist, showing the colors of the first order with one dark band; and\r\nfibers so fine as to correspond to the white or even the gray of\r\nNewton's scale are easily produced.\r\n\r\nPassing now from the most scientific test of the uniformity of these\r\nfibers, I shall next refer to one more homely. It is simply this: The\r\ncommon garden spider, except when very young, cannot climb up one of\r\nthe same size as the web on which she displays such activity. She is\r\nperfectly helpless, and slips down with a run. After vainly trying to\r\nmake any headway, she finally puts her hands (or feet) into her mouth\r\nand then tries again, with no better success. I may mention that a\r\nmale of the same species is able to run up one of these with the\r\ngreatest ease, a feat which may perhaps save the lives of a few of\r\nthese unprotected creatures when quartz fibers are more common.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to make any quantity of very fine quartz fiber without\r\na bow and arrow at all, by simply drawing out a rod of quartz over and\r\nover again in a strong oxyhydrogen jet. Then, if a stand of any sort\r\nhas been placed a few feet in front of the jet, it will be found\r\ncovered with a maze of thread, of which the photograph on the screen\r\nrepresents a sample. This is hardly distinguishable from the web spun\r\nby this magnificent spider in corners of greenhouses and such places.\r\nBy regulating the jet and the manipulation, anything from one of these\r\nstranded cables to a single ultro-microscope line may be developed.\r\n\r\nAnd now that I have explained that these fibers have such valuable\r\nproperties, it will no doubt be expected that I should perform some\r\nfeat with their aid which, up to the present time, has been considered\r\nimpossible, and this I intend to do.\r\n\r\nOf all experiments, the one which has most excited my admiration is\r\nthe famous experiment of Cavendish, of which I have a full size model\r\nbefore you. The object of this experiment is to weigh the earth by\r\ncomparing directly the force with which it attracts things with that\r\ndue to large masses of lead. As is shown by the model, any attraction\r\nwhich these large balls exert on the small ones will tend to deflect\r\nthis 6 ft. beam in one direction, and then if the balls are reversed\r\nin position, the deflection will be in the other direction. Now, when\r\nit is considered how enormously greater the earth is than these balls,\r\nit will be evident that the attraction due to them must be in\r\ncomparison excessively small. To make this evident, the enormous\r\napparatus you see had to be constructed, and then, using a fine\r\ntorsion wire, a perfectly certain but small effect was produced. The\r\nexperiment, however, could only be successfully carried out in cellars\r\nand underground places, because changes of temperature produced\r\neffects greater than those due to gravity.[2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: Dr. Lodge has been able, by an elaborate\r\n    arrangement of screens, to make this attraction just evident to\r\n    an audience.--C. V. B.]\r\n\r\nNow I have in a hole in the wall an instrument no bigger than a\r\ngalvanometer, of which a model is on the table. The balls of the\r\nCavendish apparatus, weighing several hundredweight each, are replaced\r\nby balls weighing 1¾ pounds only. The smaller balls of 1¾ pounds are\r\nreplaced by little weights of 15 grains each. The 6 foot beam is\r\nreplaced by one that will swing round freely in a tube three-quarters\r\nof an inch in diameter. The beam is, of course, suspended by a quartz\r\nfiber. With this microscopic apparatus, not only is the very feeble\r\nattraction observable, but I can actually obtain an effect eighteen\r\ntimes as great as that given by the apparatus of Cavendish, and what\r\nis more important, the accuracy of observation is enormously\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nThe light from a lamp passes through a telescope lens, and falls on\r\nthe mirror of the instrument. It is reflected back to the table, and\r\nthence by a fixed mirror to the scale on the wall, where it comes to a\r\nfocus. If the mirror on the table were plane, the whole movement of\r\nthe light would be only about eight inches, but the mirror is convex,\r\nand this magnifies the motion nearly eight times. At the present\r\nmoment the attracting weights are in one extreme position, and the\r\nline of light is quiet. I will now move them to the other position,\r\nand you will see the result--the light slowly begins to move, and\r\nslowly increases in movement. In forty seconds it will have acquired\r\nits highest velocity, and in forty more it will have stopped at 5\r\nfeet 8½ inches from the starting point, after which it will slowly\r\nmove back again, oscillating about its new position of rest.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible at this hour to enter into any calculations; I will\r\nonly say that the motion you have seen is the effect of a force of\r\nless than one ten-millionth of the weight of a grain, and that with\r\nthis apparatus I can detect a force two thousand times smaller still.\r\nThere would be no difficulty even in showing the attraction between\r\ntwo No. 5 shot.\r\n\r\nAnd now, in conclusion, I would only say that if there is anything\r\nthat is good in the experiments to which I have this evening directed\r\nyour attention, experiments conducted largely with sticks, and string,\r\nand straw and sealing wax, I may perhaps be pardoned if I express my\r\nconviction that in these days we are too apt to depart from the simple\r\nways of our fathers, and instead of following them, to fall down and\r\nworship the brazen image which the instrument maker hath set up.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE, COMPOSITION, AND TREATMENT OF ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE FABRICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inseparable duties of studying the composition of the various\r\nanimal and vegetable fabrics, as also their nature--when in contact\r\nwith the various mineral, vegetable, animal, and gaseous bodies\r\napplied in the individual industries--should not devolve upon the\r\nheads, chemists, or managers of firms alone. It is most important that\r\nevery intelligent workman, whom we cannot expect to acquire a very\r\nextensive knowledge of chemistry and perfect acquaintance of the\r\nparticular nature and component parts of fabrics, should, at least, be\r\nable to thwart the possibility of the majority of accidents brought\r\nabout in regard to the quality and aspect of materials treated by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of wool the first operations are of no mean\r\nimportance, and the whole subsequent operations and final results,\r\nalmost as a whole, depend on the manner in which the fleece washing\r\nhad been effected. In presence of suintine, as also fatty matters, as\r\nwell as the countless kinds of acids deposited on the wool through\r\nexudation from the body, etc., the various agents and materials cannot\r\nact and deposit as evenly as might be desired, and the complete\r\nobliteration of the former, therefore, becomes an absolute necessity.\r\n\r\nFor vegetable fabrics a great technical and practical knowledge is\r\nalready requisite in their cultivation itself, and before any\r\noperations are necessary at all. One of the greatest points is the\r\nripeness of the fibers. It is almost an impossibility to produce\r\ndelicate colors on vegetable fabrics which were gathered\r\ninopportunely. Numerous experiments have been made on cotton\r\ncontaining smaller or larger quantities of unripe fibers, and after\r\nthe necessary preceding operations, have been dyed in rose, purple,\r\nand blue colors, and the beauty of the shades invariably differed in\r\nproportion to the greater or lesser quantities of unripe fibers\r\ncontained in the samples, and by a careless admixture of unripe and\r\nunseasoned fibers the most brilliant colors have been completely\r\nspoiled in the presence of the former. These deficiencies of unripe\r\nvegetable fibers are so serious that the utmost precautions should be\r\ntaken, not only by planters to gather the fibers in a ripe state, but\r\nthe natural aspect of ripe and unripe fibers and their respective\r\ndifferences should be known to the operators of the individual\r\nbranches in the cotton industry themselves.\r\n\r\nThe newest vegetable fabrics, as _ma_ (China grass), pina, _abaca_, or\r\nManila hemp, _agave_, jute, and that obtained from the palm tree, must\r\nbe tended with equal care to that of cotton. The _ma_, or China grass,\r\nis obtained from the _Boehmeria nivea_, as also from the less known\r\n_Boehmeria puya_. The fibers of this stalk, after preparing and\r\nbleaching, have the whiteness of snow and the brilliancy of silk. By a\r\nspecial process--the description of which we must for the present\r\nleave in abeyance--the China grass can be transformed into a material\r\ngreatly resembling the finest quality of wool. The greatest advantage\r\nafforded in the application of China grass is, moreover, that the\r\ntissues produced with this fiber are much more easily washed than\r\nsilks, and in this operation they lose none of their beauty or their\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nThe _abaca_ is produced from the fibrous parts of the bark of the wild\r\nbanana tree, found in the Philippines. Its botanical denomination is\r\n_Musa troglodytarum_. The _abaca_ fiber is not spun or wrung, but is\r\njointed end to end. The threads are wound and subsequently beaten for\r\nsoftening, and finally bleached by plunging in lime water for\r\ntwenty-four hours, and dried in the sun.\r\n\r\nThe _pina_ is a fiber obtained from the leaf of the anana tree\r\n(_Bromelias ananas_), and is prepared in the same way as the abaca,\r\nbut extreme care must in this case be observed in culling the fibers,\r\nin order to sort in accordance with their degree of fineness.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs manufacture the stuff for their tents with a mixture of\r\ncamel's hair and the fibrous flocks (kind of wadding) obtained from\r\nthe stalks of the wafer palm (the _Chamærops humilis_).\r\n\r\nThe tissues used by the Arabs are coarse and colored, but the palm\r\nfibers--when freed from gluten, which makes them adhere more\r\nstrongly--are susceptible to divide in a most astonishing manner.\r\n\r\nThe _Agave americana_ is a coarse fiber, mostly used in France for the\r\nmanufacture of Gobelin carpets and the production of ropes. Great\r\nefforts have been made to bleach it in a satisfactory manner, as is\r\ndone with the _Phormium tenax_, but the former kind of fiber resists\r\nthe ordinary treatment with lyes, etc., and an appropriate bleaching\r\nprocess has only been discovered quite recently.\r\n\r\nJute, which by many is confounded with _Phormium tenax_, or New\r\nZealand lint, is a fiber which can be divided as finely as desired,\r\nand can be most beautifully bleached.\r\n\r\nThe jute or Indian _paat_ is generally known as a fibrous and textile\r\nfabric, obtained chiefly from Calcutta, and is similar in nature to\r\nthe _Corchorus capsularis_, an Oriental species, known in Oriental\r\nIndia by the name of _hatta jute_ and _gheenatlapaat_. This fibrous\r\nplant has the property of dividing into the finest parallel fibers,\r\nwhich can be carded without difficulty, and may be said to have the\r\nexcellent properties of linen, hemp, and cotton at once. When properly\r\nbleached, it has an aspect which is as beautiful as that of silk. A\r\nmixture of silk and jute can be easily worked together, and can also\r\nbe mixed with such vegetable fibers as cotton and linen. An immense\r\nquantity of flannel and other stuffs are now manufactured and imitated\r\nwith the different mixtures containing jute.\r\n\r\nThe _suun_ is a fiber of a plant in the form of a cane (_Crotalaria\r\njuncea_), and the paat or _suncheepaat_ is the thread of a species of\r\nspiral (_Corchorus olitarius_), sold under the name of jute tissues.\r\n\r\nThe cotton tissues lose about twenty-five per cent. of their weight in\r\nbleaching, five per cent. of the substances are dissolved through\r\nalkalies, and the other twenty per cent., which are not attacked\r\ndirectly through the alkalies, are removed through chlorine, acids,\r\nand the water itself. The linen and hemp tissues contain eighteen per\r\ncent. of substances which are soluble in alkalies, and they lose from\r\ntwenty-seven to thirty per cent. of their weight when taken through\r\nthe consecutive bleaching operations.\r\n\r\nThe substances do not alone include the substances contained in the\r\nfabric originally, but also such as are deposited in the preliminary\r\ntreatment of the fabrics, as dirt from the hands of the operator, and\r\ngluten soluble in warm water; as also glue or gelatine, potash or\r\nsoda, starch, albumen, and sugar, used by weavers, etc., and which are\r\nall soluble in water; further, such as greasy matters, calcareous\r\nsoap, coppery soap, resinous or gummo-resinous matters, and the yellow\r\nand green coloring matters contained in textile fabrics, which are\r\nsoluble in caustic soda; and finally, the earthy constituents which\r\nare soluble in acids.\r\n\r\nThe nature and composition of silk and wool is diametrically opposed\r\nto that of the former. The silk is more of a gummy nature, and is\r\nsusceptible to decompose into a kind of gelatinous mass if specially\r\ntreated.\r\n\r\nThe yellow coloring principle in silk was found only to be contained\r\nin a very small proportion, and consisting of several distinct bodies.\r\n\r\nThe wool contains, first, a fatty matter which is solid at an ordinary\r\ntemperature, and perfectly liquid at 60° C.; secondly, a fatty matter\r\nwhich is liquid at 15° C.; thirdly, a fibrous substance which\r\nessentially constitutes the wool in the strict sense of the word.\r\n\r\nThe wool at least contains three important principles, as it will be\r\nknown that the fibrous substance disengages sulphur and\r\nhydro-sulphuric acid without losing its peculiar properties; and it,\r\ntherefore, appears probable that the sulphur entered as an element in\r\nthe composition of a body which is perfectly distinct from the fibrous\r\nsubstance aforementioned.\r\n\r\nIn treating wool with nitric acid, and taking all possible precautions\r\nto determine as accurately as possible the quantity of sulphuric acid\r\nproduced by the contents of sulphur in the wool by the reaction with\r\nchloride of barium, it will be found to contain from 1.53 to 1.87 per\r\ncent. of sulphur.--_Wool and Textile Fabrics._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRODUCTION OF AMMONIA FROM COAL.[1]\r\n\r\nBy LUDWIG MOND.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: A paper read at the annual general meeting of the\r\n    Society of Chemical Industry, London, July 10, 1889.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs exemplifying to a certain extent the application of methodical\r\nresearch to an industrial problem, I propose to bring before you\r\nto-day an account of the work I have been engaged in for many years in\r\nrelation to the procuring of new and abundant supplies of ammonia, and\r\nto investigations connected therewith.\r\n\r\nThrough the classic researches of Lawes and Gilbert, who proved, in\r\nopposition to no less an authority than Liebig, that ammonia is a most\r\nvaluable manure which enables us not only to maintain, but to\r\nmultiply, the yield of our fields, and thus to feed on the same area a\r\nmuch larger number of inhabitants, the immense importance of an\r\nabundant supply of ammonia, more particularly for the Old World, with\r\nits teeming population and worn-out soil, has been apparent to every\r\none.\r\n\r\nFor many years Europe has paid to South America millions upon millions\r\nof pounds for ammonia in the shape of guano, and more recently, since\r\nthe supply of guano practically ceased, for nitrate of soda, which\r\neffectually serves the same purpose as ammonia. During the past year\r\nSouth America exported 750,000 tons of nitrate, of which 650,000 went\r\nto Europe, representing a value of not less than 6,500,000l.\r\n\r\nThe problem of saving this immense expenditure to Europe, of making\r\nourselves independent of a country so far away for the supply of a\r\nmaterial upon which the prosperity of our agriculture--our most\r\nimportant industry--depends, by supplying this ammonia from sources at\r\nour own command, is certainly one of the most important which our\r\nscience has to solve.\r\n\r\nIt is more than 100 years since Berthollet ascertained that ammonia\r\nconsists of nitrogen and hydrogen, two elements which we have in great\r\nabundance at our command, and innumerable attempts have been made\r\nduring this century to produce this valuable product by the direct\r\ncombination of the elements, as well as by indirect means. It has been\r\nequally well known that we are in possession of three abundant sources\r\nof nitrogen:\r\n\r\n  (1.) In the shape of matter of animal origin.\r\n\r\n  (2.) In the shape of matter of vegetable origin.\r\n\r\n  (3.) In the atmosphere, which contains no less than 79 per cent.\r\n  of uncombined nitrogen.\r\n\r\nIn olden times ammonia was principally obtained from animal matter,\r\noriginally in Egypt by the distillation of camel dung, later on from\r\nurine, and from the distillation of bones and horn. The quantity so\r\nobtained was very small and the products very expensive. The\r\nintroduction of coal gas for illumination gave us a considerable and\r\nconstantly increasing supply of ammonia as a by-product of the gas\r\nmanufacture, and until recently all practical efforts to increase our\r\nsupply of ammonia were directed toward collecting and utilizing in the\r\nbest possible manner the ammonia so obtained. The immense extension of\r\nthe coal gas industry all over the world has in this way put us into\r\npossession of a very considerable amount of sulphate of ammonia,\r\namounting in Europe now to 140,000 tons per annum. In recent years\r\nthis has been augmented by the ammonia obtained by the distillation of\r\nshale, by the introduction of closed ovens for the manufacture of\r\ncoke, combined with apparatus for condensing the ammonia formed in\r\nthis manufacture, and also by the condensation of the ammonia\r\ncontained in the gases from blast furnaces working with coal. But all\r\nthese new sources have so far added only about 40,000 tons of\r\nsulphate of ammonia to our supply, making a total of 180,000 tons per\r\nannum, of which about 120,000 are produced in the United Kingdom,\r\nwhile we still import 650,000 tons of nitrate of soda, equivalent to\r\n500,000 tons of sulphate of ammonia, to make up our requirements.\r\n\r\nMany processes have from time to time been proposed to obtain ammonia\r\nfrom other sources. The distillation of turf, which contains upward of\r\n3 per cent. of nitrogen, has received much attention, and a large\r\nnumber of inventors have endeavored to produce ammonia from the\r\nnitrogen of the air; but none of these processes has to my knowledge\r\nbeen successful on a manufacturing scale.\r\n\r\nMy attention was called to this subject at an early part of my career.\r\nAlready, as far back as 1861, I undertook experiments to utilize, for\r\nthe production of ammonia, waste leather, a waste material of animal\r\norigin at once abundant and very rich in nitrogen, containing from 12\r\nper cent. to 15 per cent. of this element. Distillation in iron\r\nretorts yielded about half the nitrogen of this material in the form\r\nof ammonia, the carbon remaining in the retorts containing still from\r\n6 per cent. to 8 per cent. Distillation with a moderate quantity of\r\nhydrate of lime increased the yield of ammonia only by 1 per cent. to\r\n1½ per cent. A rather better result was obtained by distilling the\r\nground residual carbon with hydrate of lime, but this operation\r\nproceeded very slowly, and the total yield of ammonia still remained\r\nvery far below the quantity theoretically obtainable, so that I came\r\nto the conclusion that it was more rational to utilize the leather,\r\nreduced to powder by mechanical means, by mixing it directly with\r\nother manures.\r\n\r\nA few years later I became connected with a large animal charcoal\r\nworks, in which sulphate of ammonia was obtained as a by-product. Here\r\nagain I was met with the fact that the yield of ammonia by no means\r\ncorresponded with the nitrogen in the raw material and that the\r\ncharcoal remaining in the retorts contained still about half as much\r\nnitrogen as had been present in the bones used.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward my attention was for many years given\r\nexclusively to the soda manufacture, and it was only in 1879 that I\r\nagain took up the question of ammonia. I then determined to submit the\r\nvarious processes which had been proposed for obtaining ammonia from\r\nthe nitrogen of the air to a searching investigation, and engaged Mr.\r\nJoseph Hawliczek to carry out the experimental work.\r\n\r\nThese processes may be broadly divided into three classes:\r\n\r\n  (1.) Processes which propose to combine nascent hydrogen with\r\n  nitrogen at high temperatures or by electricity, with or without\r\n  the presence of acid gases.\r\n\r\n  (2.) Processes in which nitrides are first formed, from which\r\n  ammonia is obtained by the action of hydrogen or steam.\r\n\r\n  (3.) Processes in which cyanides are first formed and the ammonia\r\n  obtained from these by the action of steam.\r\n\r\nWe began with an investigation of those processes in which a mixture\r\nof steam and nitrogen or of steam and air is made to act upon coke at\r\na high temperature, sometimes in the presence of lime, baryta, or an\r\nalkali, sometimes in the presence of hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nVery numerous patents have been taken out in this direction and there\r\nis no doubt that ammonia has been obtained by these processes by many\r\ninventors, but as I was aware that coke contains a considerable\r\nquantity of nitrogen, frequently as much as 1.5 per cent., which might\r\nbe the source of the ammonia obtained, I determined to carry on the\r\ninvestigation in such a way as to make quite certain whether we\r\nobtained the ammonia from the coke or from the nitrogen of the\r\natmosphere, or from both. For this purpose we made for every\r\nexperiment carried on by a mixture of nitrogen or air with steam\r\nanother experiment with steam alone, carefully excluding nitrogen from\r\nthe apparatus. A very large number of experiments carried on at\r\ncarefully determined temperatures, ranging from 500° to 1,200°C., and\r\nin which the directions given by the various inventors were most\r\ncarefully observed, all led to the same result, viz., that the\r\nquantities of ammonia obtained were the same whether nitrogen was\r\nintroduced into the apparatus with the steam or whether steam alone\r\nwas used, thus proving conclusively that the ammonia obtained was\r\nderived from the nitrogen contained in the coke.\r\n\r\nFurther, on carefully determining the nitrogen in the coke used, it\r\nwas found that the quantity of ammonia we had obtained in burning coke\r\nin a current of nitrogen and steam very nearly corresponded with the\r\ntotal nitrogen in the coke, so that we subsequently made our nitrogen\r\ndeterminations in the coke by simply burning it in a current of steam.\r\n\r\nA process belonging to this class, proposed by Hugo Fleck, in which a\r\nmixture of carbonic oxide, steam, and nitrogen is made to pass over\r\nlime at a moderate red heat in order to obtain ammonia, was also\r\ncarefully tried. It was claimed for this process that it produced\r\nnascent hydrogen at temperatures at which the ammonia is not\r\ndissociated, and for this reason succeeded where others had failed. We\r\nfound that a considerable amount of hydrogen was obtained in this way\r\nat a temperature not exceeding 350°C., and that the reaction was\r\nnearly complete at 500°C.; but although we tried many experiments over\r\na great range of temperatures, we never obtained a trace of ammonia by\r\nthis process.\r\n\r\nAmong experiments with processes of the second class, based upon the\r\nformation of nitrides and their subsequent decomposition, the nitrides\r\nof boron and titanium had received most attention from inventors. The\r\nnitride of boron, which is obtained by treating boracic acid with\r\ncarbon in the presence of nitrogen, when acted upon by steam, forms\r\nboracic acid again and yields the whole of its nitrogen in the form of\r\nammonia, but the high temperature at which the first reaction takes\r\nplace, and the volatility of boracic acid in a current of steam, make\r\nit impossible to utilize this reaction industrially.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be a better chance for a process patented by M.\r\nTessier du Mothay, who proposed to bring a mixture of nitrogen and\r\nhydrogen into contact with titanium nitride and thus to form ammonia\r\ncontinuously. Titanium is the only element of which we know at present\r\nseveral combinations with nitrogen, and the higher of these does, on\r\nbeing acted upon by a current of hydrogen at an elevated temperature,\r\nproduce ammonia and a lower nitride of titanium; but this lower\r\nnitride does not absorb nitrogen under any of the conditions under\r\nwhich we tried it, which explains the fact that if we passed a current\r\nof hydrogen and nitrogen over the higher nitride, we at first obtained\r\na quantity of ammonia corresponding to the quantity which the nitride\r\nwould give with hydrogen alone, but that the formation of ammonia then\r\nceased completely.\r\n\r\nThus far we had quite failed to get the nitrogen of the air into\r\naction.\r\n\r\nWith the third class of processes, however, based upon the formation\r\nin the first instance of cyanides, we found by our very first\r\nexperiments that the nitrogen of the atmosphere can be easily led into\r\ncombination. A few experiments showed that the cyanide of barium was\r\nmuch more readily formed than any other cyanide; so we gave our full\r\nattention from this time to the process for obtaining ammonia by means\r\nof cyanide of barium invented by MM. Margueritte and Sourdeval. This\r\nprocess consists in heating a mixture of carbonate of barium with\r\ncarbon in the presence of nitrogen, and subsequently treating the\r\ncyanide of barium produced with steam, thus producing ammonia and\r\nregenerating the carbonate of barium. A great difficulty in this\r\nprocess is that the carbonate of barium fuses at high temperatures,\r\nand when fused attacks fireclay goods very powerfully.\r\n\r\nWe found that this can be overcome by mixing the carbonate of barium\r\nwith a sufficient quantity of carbon and a small quantity of pitch,\r\nand that in this way balls can be made which will not fuse, so that\r\nthey can be treated in a continuous apparatus in which the broken\r\nbriquettes can be charged from the top, and after treatment can be\r\nwithdrawn from the bottom.\r\n\r\nWe found that the formation of cyanides required a temperature of at\r\nleast 1,200° C., and proceeded most readily at 1,400° C., temperatures\r\nwhich, although difficult to attain, are still quite within the range\r\nof practical working, and we found no difficulty in obtaining a\r\nproduct containing 30 per cent. of barium cyanide, corresponding to a\r\nconversion into cyanide of 40 per cent. of the barium present.\r\n\r\nWe found, however, that the cyanide when exposed to the atmosphere at\r\na temperature above 300° C. is readily destroyed under reformation of\r\ncarbonate of barium, so that it is absolutely necessary to cool it\r\ndown to this temperature before exposing it to the atmosphere, a fact\r\nof great importance that had hitherto been overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe operation for producing ammonia and regenerating the carbonate of\r\nbarium by acting upon the cyanide with steam offers no difficulty\r\nwhatever, and if the temperature is not allowed to exceed 500° C., the\r\nresults are quantitative. The regenerated carbonate of barium acts\r\nactually better than the ground witherite used in the first instance,\r\nand if care is taken that no impurities are introduced by the pitch\r\nwhich is used to remake the briquettes and to replace the small amount\r\nof carbon consumed at each operation, I see no reason why it should\r\nnot continue to act for a very long time.\r\n\r\nThe cyanide is not acted on by carbonic oxide, but carbonic acid\r\ndestroys it at high temperatures, so that it is not possible to\r\nproduce it by heating the briquettes directly in a flame free from\r\noxygen, but containing carbonic acid. The process has, therefore, to\r\nbe carried out in closed vessels, and I designed for this purpose the\r\nfollowing apparatus:\r\n\r\nClay retorts of moderate dimensions and thin walls are placed\r\nvertically in a furnace, passing through the hearth as well as through\r\nthe arch of the furnace. These are joined at the bottom to cast iron\r\nretorts of the same shape as the earthenware retort. Through a cast\r\niron mouthpiece on the top of the retort the material was introduced,\r\nwhile in the cast iron retort below the material was cooled to the\r\nnecessary temperature by radiation and by the cold nitrogen gas\r\nintroduced into the bottom of it. The lower end of the cast iron\r\nretort was furnished with an arrangement for taking out from time to\r\ntime small quantities of the material, while fresh material was in the\r\nsame proportion fed in at the top. As a source of nitrogen I used the\r\ngases escaping from the carbonating towers of the ammonia-soda\r\nprocess. The formation of cyanide of barium from barium carbonate,\r\ncarbon, and nitrogen absorbs a very large amount of heat--no less than\r\n97,000 calories per equivalent of the cyanide formed--which heat has\r\nto be transmitted through the walls of the retort. I therefore\r\nconsidered it necessary to use retorts with very thin walls, but I did\r\nnot succeed in obtaining retorts of this description which would\r\nresist the very high temperatures which the process requires, and for\r\nthis reason I abandoned these experiments. I was at that time not\r\nacquainted with the excellent quality of clay retorts used in zinc\r\nworks, with which I have since experimented for a different purpose. I\r\nhave no doubt that with such retorts the production of cyanides by\r\nthis process can be carried out without great difficulty.\r\n\r\nI believe that the process will prove remunerative for the manufacture\r\nof cyanogen products, which, if produced more cheaply, may in the\r\nfuture play an important role in organic synthesis, in the extraction\r\nof noble metals, and possibly other chemical and metallurgical\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThe process certainly also offers a solution of the problem of\r\nobtaining ammonia from the nitrogen of the atmosphere, but whether\r\nthis can be done with satisfactory commercial results is a question I\r\ncannot at present answer, as I have not been able to secure the data\r\nfor making the necessary calculations.\r\n\r\nI am the more doubtful about this point, as in the course of our\r\ninvestigations I have found means to produce ammonia at small cost and\r\nin great abundance from the immense store of combined nitrogen which\r\nwe possess in our coal fields.\r\n\r\nAmong the processes for obtaining ammonia from the nitrogen of the air\r\nwhich we investigated, was one apparently of great simplicity,\r\npatented by Messrs. Rickman and Thompson. These gentlemen state that\r\nby passing air and steam through a deep coal fire, the nitrogen so\r\npassed through is to a certain extent converted into ammonia. In\r\ninvestigating this statement we found that the process described\r\ncertainly yields a considerable quantity of ammonia, but when we\r\nburned the same coal at a moderate temperature by means of steam\r\nalone in a tube heated from the outside, we obtained twice as much\r\nammonia as we had done by burning it with a mixture of air and steam,\r\nproving in this case, as in all others, the source of the ammonia to\r\nhave been the nitrogen contained in the coal. The quantity of ammonia\r\nobtained was, however, so large that I determined to follow up this\r\nexperience, and at once commenced experiments on a semi-manufacturing\r\nscale to ascertain whether they would lead to practical and economic\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nI came to the conclusion that burning coal by steam alone at a\r\ntemperature at which the ammonia formed should not be dissociated,\r\nalthough it yielded more ammonia, would not lead to an economic\r\nprocess, because it would require apparatus heated from the outside,\r\nof great complication, bulk, and costliness, on account of the immense\r\nquantity of raw material to be treated for a small amount of ammonia\r\nobtainable.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the coal could be burned in gas producers by a\r\nmixture of air and steam, the plant and working of it would be simple\r\nand inexpensive, the gas obtained could be utilized in the same way as\r\nordinary producer gas, and would pay to a large extent for the coal\r\nused in the operation, so that although only one-half of the ammonia\r\nwould be obtained, it seemed probable that the result would be\r\neconomical.\r\n\r\nI consequently constructed gas producers and absorbing plant of\r\nvarious designs and carried on experiments for a number of years.\r\nThese experiments were superintended by Mr. G. H. Beckett, Dr. Carl\r\nMarkel, and, during the last four years, by Dr. Adolf Staub, to whose\r\nzeal and energy I am much indebted for the success that has been\r\nachieved. The object of these experiments was to determine the most\r\nfavorable conditions for the economic working of the process with\r\nrespect to both the cost of manufacture as well as the first cost and\r\nsimplicity of plant. The cost of manufacture depends mainly upon the\r\nyield of ammonia, as the expenses remain almost the same whether a\r\nlarge or a small amount of ammonia is obtained; the only other item of\r\nimportance is the quantity of steam used in the process. We found the\r\nyield of ammonia to vary with the temperature at which the producer\r\nwas working, and to be highest when the producer was worked as cool as\r\nwas compatible with a good combustion of the fuel. The temperature\r\nagain depended upon the amount of steam introduced into the producer,\r\nand of course decreased the more steam increased. We obtained the best\r\npractical results by introducing about two tons of steam for every ton\r\nof fuel consumed. We experimented upon numerous kinds of fuel, common\r\nslack and burgy of the Lancashire, Staffordshire, and Nottinghamshire\r\ndistricts. We found not much difference in the amount of nitrogen\r\ncontained in these fuels, which varied between 1.2 and 1.6 per cent.,\r\nnor did we find much difference in the ammonia obtained from these\r\nfuels if worked under similar conditions. Employing the quantity of\r\nsteam just named we recovered about half the nitrogen in the form of\r\nammonia, yielding on an average 0.8 per cent. of ammonia, equal to 32\r\nkilos, of sulphate per ton of fuel. In order to obtain regular results\r\nwe found it necessary to work with a great depth of fuel in the\r\nproducers, so that slight irregularities in the working would not\r\naffect results. Open burning kinds of slack do of course work with the\r\ngreater ease, but there is no difficulty in using a caking fuel, as\r\nthe low temperature at which the producers work prevents clinkering\r\nand diminishes the tendency of such fuels to cake together.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of steam thus required to obtain a good yield of ammonia\r\nis rather considerable, and threatened to become a serious item of\r\nexpense. Only one-third of this steam is decomposed, in its passage\r\nthrough the producer, and two-thirds remain mixed with the gases which\r\nleave the producer. My endeavors were consequently directed toward\r\nfinding means to recover this steam, and to return it to the\r\nproducers, and also to utilize the heat of the gases which leave the\r\nproducers with a temperature of 450° to 500° C., for raising steam for\r\nthe same purpose. The difficulties in the way of attaining this end\r\nand at the same time of recovering, in a simple manner, the small\r\namount of ammonia contained in the immense volume of gas we have to\r\ndeal with, were very great. We obtain from one ton of coal 160,000\r\ncubic feet of dry gas at 0° C. and atmospheric pressure. The steam\r\nmixed with this gas as it leaves the producer adds another 80,000\r\ncubic feet to this, and the large amount of latent heat in this\r\nquantity of steam makes the problem still more difficult. The\r\napplication of cooling arrangements, such as have been successfully\r\napplied to blast furnace gases, in which there is no steam present,\r\nand which depend upon the cooling through the metallic sides of the\r\napparatus, is here practically out of the question. After trying a\r\nnumber of different kinds of apparatus, I have succeeded in solving\r\nthe problem in the following way:\r\n\r\nThe gases issuing from the producers are led through a rectangular\r\nchamber partly filled with water, which is thrown up in a fine spray\r\nby revolving beaters so as to fill the whole area of the chamber. This\r\nwater, of course, becomes hot; a certain quantity of it evaporates,\r\nthe spray produced washes all dust and soot out of the gases, and also\r\ncondenses the fixed ammonia. The water thus becomes, to a certain\r\ndegree, saturated with ammonia salts, and a certain portion of it is\r\nregularly removed from the chamber and distilled with lime to recover\r\nthe ammonia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Longitudinal Section of Plant for obtaining Ammonia\r\nfrom Gas Producers.\r\n\r\nCross Section through Gas Producers.]\r\n\r\nThis chamber is provided with water lutes, through which the tar\r\ncondensed in it is from time to time removed. From this chamber the\r\ngases, which are now cooled down to about 100° C., and are loaded with\r\na large amount of water vapor, are passed through a scrubber filled\r\nwith perforated bricks, in which the ammonia contained in the gases is\r\nabsorbed by sulphuric acid. In this scrubber a fairly concentrated\r\nsolution of sulphate of ammonia containing 36 to 38 per cent. is used,\r\nto which a small quantity of sulphuric acid is added, so that the\r\nliquid leaving the scrubber contains only 2.5 per cent. of free acid.\r\nThis is necessary, as a liquid containing more acid would act upon the\r\ntarry matter and produce a very dark-colored solution. The liquid\r\nrunning from the scrubber is passed through a separator in which the\r\nsolution of sulphate of ammonia separates from the tar. The greater\r\nportion of the clear liquid is, after adding a fresh quantity of acid\r\nto it, pumped back through the scrubber. A certain portion of it is,\r\nafter treatment with a small quantity of heavy tar oils, which take\r\nthe tarry matter dissolved in it out, evaporated in conical lead-lined\r\npans furnished with lead steam coils, and which are kept constantly\r\nfilled by the addition of fresh liquor until the whole mass is thick.\r\nThis is then run out on a strainer and yields, after draining and\r\nwashing with a little water, a sulphate of ammonia of very fair\r\nquality, which finds a ready sale. The mother liquor, which contains\r\nall the free acid, is pumped back to the scrubber.\r\n\r\nThe gas on entering this scrubber contains only 0.13 volume per cent.\r\nof ammonia, and on leaving the scrubber it contains not more than\r\none-tenth of this quantity. Its temperature has been reduced to\r\n80° C., and is fully saturated with moisture, so that practically no\r\ncondensation of water takes place in the scrubber. The gas is next\r\npassed through a second scrubber filled with perforated wood blocks.\r\nIn this it meets with a current of cold water which condenses the\r\nsteam, the water being thereby heated to about 78° C. In this scrubber\r\nthe gas is cooled down to about 40°-50° C., and passes from it to the\r\ngas main leading to the various places where it is to be consumed. The\r\nhot water obtained in this second scrubber is passed through a vessel\r\nsuitably constructed for separating the tar which is mixed with it,\r\nand is then pumped through a third scrubber, through which, in an\r\nopposite direction to the hot water, cold air is passed. This is\r\nforced by means of a Roots blower through the scrubber into the\r\nproducer.\r\n\r\nThe air gets heated to about 76° C. and saturated with moisture at\r\nthat temperature by its contact with the hot water, and the water\r\nleaves this third scrubber cold enough to be pumped back through the\r\nsecond scrubber. The same quantity of water is thus constantly used\r\nfor condensing the water vapor in one scrubber and giving it up to the\r\nair in the other. In this way we recover and return to the producer\r\nfully two-thirds of the steam which has been originally introduced, so\r\nthat we have to add to the air, which has thus been loaded with\r\nmoisture, an additional quantity of steam equal to only one-third of\r\nthe total quantity required before it enters the producer. This\r\nadditional quantity of steam, which amounts to 0.6 ton of steam for\r\nevery ton of fuel burnt, we obtain as exhaust steam from the engines\r\ndriving the blowers and pumps required for working the plant.\r\n\r\nThe gas producers which I prefer to use are of rectangular shape, so\r\nthat a number of them can be put into a row. They are six feet wide\r\nand 12 feet long inside. The air is introduced and the ashes removed\r\nat the two small sides of the producer which taper toward the middle\r\nand are closed at the bottom by a water lute of sufficient depth for\r\nthe pressure under which the air is forced in, equal to about 4 inches\r\nof water. The ashes are taken out from underneath the water, the\r\nproducers having no grate or fire bars at all. The air enters just\r\nabove the level of the water through a pipe connected with the blower.\r\nThese small sides of the producer rest upon cast iron plates lined to\r\na certain height with brickwork, and this brickwork is carried by\r\nhorizontal cast iron plates above the air entrance. In this way a\r\nchamber is formed of triangular shape, one side of which is closed by\r\nthe ashes, and thus the air is distributed over the whole width of the\r\nproducer.\r\n\r\nThe gas is taken out in the middle of the top of the producer by an\r\niron pipe, and fuel charged in by hoppers on both sides of this pipe.\r\nBetween the pipe and the hoppers two hanging arches are put into the\r\nproducers a certain distance down, and the fuel is kept above the\r\nbottom level of these hanging arches. This compels the products of\r\ndistillation, produced when fresh fuel is charged in, to pass through\r\nthe incandescent fuel between the two hanging arches, whereby the\r\ntarry products are to a considerable extent converted into permanent\r\ngas, and the coal dust arising from the charging is kept back in the\r\nproducer.\r\n\r\nThe details of construction of this plant will be easily understood by\r\nreference to the diagrams before you.\r\n\r\nThe fuel we use is a common kind of slack, and contains, on an\r\naverage, 33.5 per cent. of volatile matter, including water, and 11.5\r\nper cent. of ashes, leaving 55 per cent. of non-volatile carbon.\r\n\r\nThe cinders which we take out of the producer contain, on an average,\r\n33 per cent. of carbon. Of this we recover about one-half by riddling\r\nor picking, which we return to the producer. The amount of unburnt\r\ncarbon lost in the cinders is thus not more than 3 per cent. to 4 per\r\ncent. on the weight of fuel used.\r\n\r\nThe gas we obtain contains, in a dry state, on an average, 15 per\r\ncent. of carbonic acid, 10 per cent. of carbonic oxide, 23 per cent.\r\nof hydrogen, 3 per cent. of hydrocarbons, and 49 per cent. of\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\nThe caloric value of this gas is very nearly equal to 73 per cent. of\r\nthe caloric value of the fuel used, but in using this gas for heating\r\npurposes, such as raising steam or making salt, we utilize the heat it\r\ncan give very much better than in burning fuel, as we can completely\r\nburn it with almost the theoretical quantity of air, so that the\r\nproducts of combustion resulting do not contain more than 1 to 2 per\r\ncent. of free oxygen. Consequently the heat escaping into the chimney\r\nis very much less than when fuel is burnt direct, and we arrive at\r\nevaporating, by means of the gas, 85 per cent. of the water that we\r\nwould evaporate by burning the fuel direct, in ordinary fireplaces.\r\n\r\nWe have, however, to use a certain quantity of steam in the producers\r\nand in evaporating the sulphate of ammonia liquors, which has to be\r\ndeducted from the steam that can be raised by the gas in order to get\r\nat the quantity of available steam therefrom obtainable. The former\r\namounts, as already stated, to 0.6 ton, the latter to 0.1 ton of steam\r\nper ton of fuel burnt, making a total of 0.7 ton. The gas obtained\r\nfrom one ton of fuel evaporates 5.8 tons of water in good steam\r\nboilers, working at a rate of evaporation of 50 to 55 tons per 24\r\nhours under 90 lb. pressure. Deducting from this the 0.7 ton necessary\r\nfor working the plant leaves an available amount of steam raised by\r\nthe gas from one ton of fuel of 5.1 tons, equal to 75 per cent. of the\r\nsteam that we can obtain from the same fuel by hand firing.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the gas, we obtain about 3 per cent. of tar from the\r\nfuel. This tar is very thick, and of little commercial value. It\r\ncontains only 4 per cent. of oils volatile below 200° C., and 38 per\r\ncent. of oils of a higher boiling point, consisting mostly of creosote\r\noils very similar to those obtained from blast furnaces; and only\r\nsmall quantities of anthracene and paraffin wax.\r\n\r\nI have made no attempts to utilize this tar except as fuel. It\r\nevaporates nearly twice as much water as its weight of coal, and we\r\nhave thus to add its evaporative efficiency to that of the gas given\r\nabove, leading to a total of about 80 per cent. of the evaporative\r\nefficiency of the fuel used in the producers. The loss involved in\r\ngasifying the fuel to recover the ammonia therefrom amounts thus to 20\r\nper cent. of the fuel used. This means that, where we have now to burn\r\n100 tons of fuel, we shall have to burn 125 tons in the producers in\r\norder to obtain ammonia equal to about half the nitrogen contained\r\ntherein. Our actual yield of ammonia on a large scale amounting on an\r\naverage to 32 kilos., equal to 70.6 lb. per ton of fuel, 125 tons of\r\nfuel will turn out 4 tons of sulphate of ammonia. We thus consume 6.25\r\ntons of fuel for every ton of sulphate obtained, or nearly the same\r\nquantity as is used in producing a ton of caustic soda by the Le Blanc\r\nprocess--a product not more than half the value of ammonium sulphate.\r\nAt present prices in Northwich this fuel represents a value of 35s. If\r\nwe add to this the extra cost of labor over and above the cost of\r\nburning fuel in ordinary fireplaces, the cost of sulphuric acid, bags,\r\netc., we come to a total of 4l. 10s. to 5l. per ton of sulphate of\r\nammonia, which at the present selling price of this article, say 12l.\r\nper ton, leaves, after a liberal allowance for wear and tear of plant,\r\nan ample margin of profit. With a rise in the price of fuel, this\r\nmargin, however, rapidly decreases, and the working of the process\r\nwill, of course, be much more expensive on a small scale, as will also\r\nbe the cost of the plant, which under all circumstances is very\r\nconsiderable. The great advantages incidental to this process over and\r\nabove the profit arising from the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia,\r\nviz., the absolute impossibility of producing smoke and the great\r\nregularity of the heating resulting from the use of gas, are,\r\ntherefore, as far as I can see for the present, only available for\r\nlarge consumers of cheap fuel.\r\n\r\nWe have tried many experiments to produce hydrochloric acid in the\r\nproducers, with the hope of thereby increasing the yield of ammonia,\r\nas it is well known that ammonium chloride vapor, although it consists\r\nof a mixture of ammonia gas and hydrochloric acid gas, is not at all\r\ndissociated at temperatures at which the dissociation of ammonia alone\r\nhas already taken place to a considerable extent.\r\n\r\nI had also hoped that I might in this way produce the acid necessary\r\nto combine with the ammonia at very small cost. For this purpose we\r\nmoistened the fuel used with concentrated brine, and also with the\r\nwaste liquors from the ammonia soda manufacture, consisting mainly of\r\nchloride of calcium; and we also introduced with the fuel balls made\r\nby mixing very concentrated chloride of calcium solution with clay,\r\nwhich allowed us to produce a larger quantity of hydrochloric acid in\r\nthe producer than by the other methods.\r\n\r\nWe did in this way succeed in producing hydrochloric acid sometimes\r\nless and sometimes more than was necessary to combine with the\r\nammonia, but we did not succeed in producing with regularity the exact\r\namount of acid necessary to neutralize the ammonia. When the ammonia\r\nwas in excess, we had therefore to use sulphuric acid as before to\r\nabsorb this excess, and we were never certain that sometimes the\r\nhydrochloric acid might not be in excess, which would have\r\nnecessitated to construct the whole plant so that it could have\r\nresisted the action of weak hydrochloric acid--a difficulty which I\r\nhave not ventured to attack. The yield of ammonia was not in any case\r\nincreased by the presence of the hydrochloric acid. This explains\r\nitself if we consider that there is only a very small amount of\r\nammonia and hydrochloric acid diffused through a very large volume of\r\nother gases, so that the very peculiar protective action which the\r\nhydrochloric acid does exercise in retarding the dissociation of\r\nammonia in ammonium chloride vapor, where an atom of ammonia is always\r\nin contact with an atom of hydrochloric acid, will be diminished\r\nalmost to zero in such a dilute gas where the atoms of hydrochloric\r\nacid and ammonia will only rarely come into immediate contact with\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nWhen we burnt coke by a mixture of air and steam in presence of a\r\nlarge excess of hydrochloric acid, the yield of ammonia certainly was\r\nthereby considerably increased, but such a large excess cannot be used\r\non an industrial scale. I have therefore for the present to rest\r\nsatisfied with obtaining only half the nitrogen contained in the fuel\r\nin the form of ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe enormous consumption of fuel in this country--amounting to no less\r\nthan 150 million tons per annum--would at this rate yield as much as\r\nfive million tons of sulphate of ammonia a year, so that if only\r\none-tenth of this fuel would be treated by the process, England alone\r\ncould supply the whole of the nitrogenous compounds, sulphate of\r\nammonia, and nitrate of soda at present consumed by the Old World. As\r\nthe process is especially profitable for large consumers of fuel\r\nsituated in districts where fuel is cheap, it seems to me particularly\r\nsuitable to be adopted in this country. It promises to give England\r\nthe privilege of supplying the Old World with this all-important\r\nfertilizer, and while yielding a fair profit to the invested capital\r\nand finding employment for a considerable number of men, to make us,\r\nlast not least, independent of the New World for our supply of so\r\nindispensable a commodity.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving my subject, I will, if you will allow me, give you in a\r\nfew words a description of two other inventions which have been the\r\noutcome of this research. While looking one day at the beautiful,\r\nalmost colorless, flame of the producer gas burning under one of our\r\nboilers, it occurred to me that a gas so rich in hydrogen might be\r\nturned to better use, and that it might be possible to convert it\r\ndirect into electricity by means of a gas battery.\r\n\r\nYou all know that Lord Justice Grove showed, now fifty years ago, that\r\ntwo strips of platinum partly immersed in dilute sulphuric acid, one\r\nof which is in contact with hydrogen and the other with oxygen,\r\nproduce electricity. I will not detain you with the many and varied\r\nforms of gas batteries which Dr. Carl Langer (to whom I intrusted this\r\ninvestigation) has made and tried during the last four years, in order\r\nto arrive at the construction of a gas battery which would give a\r\npractical result, but I will call your attention to the battery before\r\nme on the table, which is the last result of our extended labors in\r\nthis direction, and which we hope will mark a great step in advance in\r\nthe economic production of electricity.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing feature of this battery is that the electrolyte is\r\nnot employed as a mobile liquid, but in a quasi-solid form, and it is,\r\ntherefore, named dry gas battery. It consists of a number of elements,\r\nwhich are formed of a porous diaphragm of a non-conducting material\r\n(in this instance plaster of Paris), which is impregnated with dilute\r\nsulphuric acid. Both sides of this diaphragm are covered with very\r\nfine platinum leaf perforated with very numerous small holes, and over\r\nthis a thin film of platinum black. Both these coatings are in contact\r\nwith frameworks of lead and antimony, insulated one from the other,\r\nwhich conduct the electricity to the poles of the battery.\r\n\r\nA number of these elements are placed side by side, with\r\nnon-conducting frames intervening, so as to form chambers through\r\nwhich the hydrogen gas is passed along one side of the element and air\r\nalong the other.\r\n\r\nThis peculiar construction allows us to get a very large amount of\r\nduty from a very small amount of platinum. One of the batteries before\r\nyou, consisting of seven elements, with a total effective surface of\r\nhalf a square meter, contains 2½ grammes of platinum leaf and 7\r\ngrammes of platinum black, a total of 9½ grammes of platinum, and\r\nproduces a current of 2 amperes and 5 volts, or 10 watts, when the\r\nouter resistance is properly adjusted. This current is equal to nearly\r\n50 per cent. of the total energy obtainable from the hydrogen absorbed\r\nin the battery.\r\n\r\nIn order to maintain a constant current, we have from time to time\r\n(say once an hour) to interchange the gases, so as to counteract the\r\ndisturbing influence produced by the transport of the sulphuric acid\r\ngas from one side of the diaphragm to the other. This operation can\r\neasily be performed automatically by a commutator worked by a clock.\r\n\r\nThe water produced in the battery by the oxidation of the hydrogen is\r\ncarried off by the inert gas mixed with the hydrogen, and by the air,\r\nof which we use a certain excess for this purpose. This is important,\r\nas if the platinum black becomes wet, it loses its absorbing power for\r\nthe gases almost completely and stops the work of the battery. To\r\navoid this was in fact the great difficulty in designing a powerful\r\ngas battery, and all previous constructions which employed the\r\nelectrolyte as a mobile liquid failed in consequence.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained by our battery are practically the same whether\r\npure oxygen and hydrogen or air and gases containing 25 per cent. of\r\nhydrogen are used; but we found that the latter gases must be\r\npractically free from carbonic oxide and hydrocarbons, which both\r\ninterfere very much with the absorbing power of the platinum black.\r\n\r\nWe had thus to find a cheap method of eliminating these two gases from\r\nthe producer gas, and converting them at the same time into their\r\nequivalent of hydrogen. The processes hitherto known for this purpose,\r\nviz., passing a mixture of such gases with steam over lime (which I\r\nmentioned some time ago) or over oxide of iron or manganese, require\r\nhigh temperatures, which render them expensive, and the latter do not\r\neffect the reaction to a sufficient extent for our purpose.\r\n\r\nWe have succeeded in attaining our object at a temperature below that\r\nat which the gases leave my producers, viz., at 350° C. to 450° C., by\r\npassing the producer gases, still containing a considerable excess of\r\nsteam, over metallic nickel or cobalt. These metals have the\r\nextraordinary property of decomposing almost completely, even at the\r\nlow temperature named, carbonic oxide into carbon and carbonic acid\r\nand hydrocarbons into carbon and hydrogen.\r\n\r\nIn order to carry the process out with small quantities of nickel and\r\ncobalt, we impregnate pumice stone or similar material with a salt of\r\nnickel or cobalt, and reduce this by means of hydrogen or producer\r\ngas. These pieces of pumice stone are filled into a retort or chamber\r\nand the hot gases passed through them. As the reaction produces heat,\r\nit is not necessary to heat the chambers or retorts from the outside\r\nwhen the necessary temperature has once been attained. This process\r\nhas not yet been carried out on a large scale, but the laboratory\r\nexperiments have been so satisfactory that we have no doubt as to its\r\ncomplete success. It will enable us to obtain gases containing 36 per\r\ncent. to 40 per cent. of hydrogen and practically free from carbonic\r\noxide and hydrocarbons from producer gas at a very small cost, and\r\nthus to make the latter suitable for the production of electricity by\r\nour gas battery. We obtain, as stated before, 50 per cent. of the\r\nenergy in the hydrogen absorbed in the battery in the form of\r\nelectricity, while, if the same gas was consumed under steam boilers\r\nto make steam, which, as I have shown before, could in this way be\r\nraised cheaper than by burning fuel direct, and if this steam was\r\nturned into motive power by first-rate steam engines, and the motive\r\npower converted into electricity by a dynamo, the yield of electricity\r\nwould in the most favorable case not exceed 8 per cent. of the energy\r\nin the gas. I hope that this kind of battery will one day enable us to\r\nperform chemical operations by electricity on the largest scale, and\r\nto press this potent power into the service of the chemical\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\nThe statement is frequently made that \"Necessity is the mother of\r\ninvention.\" If this has been the case in the past, I think it is no\r\nlonger so in our days, since science has made us acquainted with the\r\ncorrelation of forces, teaching us what amount of energy we utilize\r\nand how much we waste in our various methods for attaining certain\r\nobjects, and indicating to us where and in what direction and how far\r\nimprovement is possible; and since the increase in our knowledge of\r\nthe properties of matter enables us to form an opinion beforehand as\r\nto the substances we have available for obtaining a desired result.\r\n\r\nWe can now foresee, in most cases, in what direction progress in\r\ntechnology will move, and in consequence the inventor is now\r\nfrequently in advance of the wants of his time. He may even create new\r\nwants, to my mind a distinct step in the development of human culture.\r\nIt can then no longer be stated that \"Necessity is the mother of\r\ninvention;\" but I think it may truly be said that the steady,\r\nmethodical investigation of natural phenomena is the father of\r\nindustrial progress.\r\n\r\nSir Lowthian Bell, Bart., F.R.S., in moving a vote of thanks, said\r\nthat the meeting had had the privilege of listening to a description\r\nof results obtained by a man of exceptional intelligence and learning,\r\nsupplemented by that devotion of mind which qualified him to pursue\r\nhis work with great energy and perseverance. The importance of the\r\npresident's address could not possibly be overrated. At various\r\nperiods different substances had been put forward as indications of\r\nthe civilization of the people. He remembered hearing from Dr. Ure\r\nthat he considered the consumption of sulphuric acid to be the most\r\naccurate measure of the civilization of the people.\r\n\r\nIn course of time sulphuric acid gave way to soap, the consumption of\r\nwhich was probably still regarded as the great exponent of\r\ncivilization by such of his fellow citizens as had thereby made their\r\nname. From what he had heard that morning, however, he should be\r\ninclined to make soap yield to ammonia, as sulphuric acid had in its\r\ntime succumbed to soap. For not only was ammonia of great importance\r\nto us as a manufacturing nation, but it almost appeared to be a\r\ncondition of our existence. England had a large population\r\nconcentrated on an area so small as to make it almost a matter of\r\napprehension whether the surface could maintain the people upon it.\r\n\r\nWe were now importing almost as much food as we consumed, and were\r\nthus more and more dependent on the foreigner. Under certain\r\nconditions this would become a very serious matter, and thus any one\r\nwho showed how to produce plenty of ammonia at a cheap rate was a\r\nbenefactor to his country. Mr. Mond's process seemed to come nearer to\r\nsuccess than any which had preceded it, and it needed no words from\r\nhim to induce the meeting to accord a hearty vote of thanks to the\r\npresident for his admirable paper.\r\n\r\nMr. J. C. Stevenson, M.P., in seconding the motion, said that no paper\r\ncould be more interesting and valuable to the society than that\r\ndelivered by the president. It opened out a future for the advancement\r\nof chemical industry which almost overcame one by the greatness of its\r\npossibilities. Mr. Mond had performed an invaluable service by\r\ninvestigating the various methods proposed for the manufacture of\r\nammonia, and clearing the decks of those processes supposed by their\r\ninventors to be valuable, but proved by him to be delusive. It gave\r\nhim hearty pleasure therefore to second the vote of thanks proposed by\r\nSir Lowthian Bell.\r\n\r\nThe vote having been put and carried by acclamation, after a brief\r\nreply from the president:\r\n\r\nThe secretary read the report of the scrutators, which showed that 158\r\nballot papers had been sent in, 154 voting for the proposed list\r\nintact, and four substituting other names. The gentlemen nominated in\r\nthe list issued by the Council were therefore declared elected.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his brief report for the year ending May 1, 1889, the director of\r\nthe Pasteur Institute, Paris, announces the treatment of 1,673\r\nsubjects, of whom 6 were seized with rabies during and 4 within a\r\nfortnight after the process. But 3 only succumbed after the treatment\r\nhad been completely carried out, making 1 death in 554, or, including\r\nall cases, 1 in 128.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALKALI MANUFACTORIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the alkali, etc., Works Regulation Act was passed in 1881, it was\r\nsupposed that the result would be that the atmosphere in the districts\r\nwhere such works are situated would be considerably improved, and,\r\nconsequently, that vegetation would have a better chance in the\r\nstruggle for existence, and the sanitary conditions of human dwellings\r\nwould be advanced. In all these respects the act has been a success.\r\nBut perhaps the most notable result is the effect which the act and\r\nthose which have preceded it have had upon the manufactures which they\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nThis was not anticipated by manufacturers, but now one of the\r\nprincipal of them (Mr. A. M. Chance) has stated that \"Government\r\ninspection has not only led to material improvement in the general\r\nmanagement of chemical works, but it has also been in reality a\r\ndistinct benefit to, rather than a tax upon, the owners of such\r\nworks.\"\r\n\r\nThis expression of opinion is substantiated by the chief inspector\r\nunder the act, whose report for last year has recently been laid\r\nbefore the local government board.\r\n\r\nThere are 1,057 works in the United Kingdom which are visited by the\r\ninspectors, and in only two of these during 1888 did the neglect to\r\ncarry out the inspectors' warnings become so flagrant as to call for\r\nlegal interference; viz., in the case of Thomas Farmer & Co.\r\n(limited), Victoria Docks, E., who were fined 20l. and costs for\r\nfailing to use the \"best practicable means\" for preventing the escape\r\nof acid gas from manure plant; and in the case of Joseph Fison & Co.,\r\nBramford, who were fined 50l. and costs for excessive escape of acid\r\ngas from sulphuric acid plant. There were seven other cases, but these\r\nwere simply for failure to register under the act.\r\n\r\nIt is very evident, therefore, that from a public point of view the\r\nact is splendidly successful, and from the practical or scientific\r\nside it is no less satisfactory.\r\n\r\nOf the total number of chemical works (1,057) 866 are registered in\r\nEngland, 131 in Scotland, and 44 in Ireland--a decrease in the case of\r\nScotland of 8, and in Ireland of 2 from the previous year, while\r\nEngland has increased by 1. This must not, however, be taken as a sign\r\nof diminished production, because there is a tendency for the larger\r\nworks to increase in size and for the smaller ones to close their\r\noperations. The principal nuisances which the inspectors have to\r\nprevent are the escape of hydrochloric acid gas from alkali works and\r\nof sulphurous gas from vitriol and manure works.\r\n\r\nThe alkali act forbids the manufacturer to allow the escape of more\r\nthan 5 per cent. of the hydrochloric acid which he produces, or that\r\nthat acid must not exist to a greater extent than 0.2 grain in 1 cubic\r\nfoot of air, steam, or chimney gas which accompanies. The inspectors'\r\nfigures for last year show that the percentage of the acid which\r\nescaped amounted to only 1.96 of the total produced, which is equal to\r\n0.089 grain per cubic foot, and much below the figures for previous\r\nyears. The figures in regard to sulphurous gas are equally\r\nsatisfactory. The act allows 4 grains of sulphuric anhydride (SO3) per\r\ncubic foot to escape into the air, and last year's average was only\r\n0.737 grain, or less than a fifth of the limit.\r\n\r\nOf course it is now the aim of the Leblanc alkali manufacturers to\r\nreduce the escape of hydrochloric acid to the lowest possible amount,\r\nas their profits depend solely upon the sale of chlorine products,\r\nsoda products being sold at a loss. In this connection it is\r\ninteresting to note that the amount of common salt manufactured in the\r\nUnited Kingdom in 1888 was 2,039,867 tons, and of this nearly 600,000\r\ntons were taken by Leblanc soda makers, and over 200,000 tons by the\r\nammonia-soda makers. The figures are very largely in excess of\r\nprevious years, and indicate a gratifying growth in trade.\r\n\r\nThe salt used in the Leblanc process yields the hydrochloric acid, and\r\nthat in the ammonia-soda method none, so that we may put down the\r\ntheoretical production of acid as 380,000 tons, 7,600 tons of which\r\nwas allowed to escape.\r\n\r\nWhat was a mere trace in the chimney gases amounts, therefore, to a\r\ngood round figure at the end of a year, and if it were converted into\r\nbleaching powder it would be worth nearly 150,000l. These figures are,\r\nit should be understood, based on theory, but they serve to show to\r\nwhat importance a gas has now reached which twenty-five years ago was\r\na perfect incubus to the manufacturers, and wrought desolation in the\r\ncountry sides miles and miles around the producing works. There has\r\nlong been an expectation that the ammonia-soda makers would add the\r\nmanufacture of bleaching powder to their process, but they appear to\r\nbe as far as ever from that result, and meanwhile the Leblanc makers\r\nare honestly striving to utilize every atom of the valuable material\r\nwhich they handle. Hence the eagerness to recover the sulphur from\r\ntank waste by one or other of the few workable processes which have\r\nbeen proposed.\r\n\r\nThis waste contains from 11 to 15 per cent. of sulphur, and when it is\r\nstated that the total amount of tank waste produced yearly is about\r\n750,000 tons, containing about 100,000 tons of sulphur, it will be\r\nseen how large is the reward held out to the successful manipulator.\r\nMoreover, the value of the sulphur that might possibly be saved is not\r\nthe only prize held out to those who can successfully deal with the\r\nwaste, for this material is not only thrown away as useless, but much\r\nexpense is incurred in the throwing.\r\n\r\nIn Lancashire and in other inland districts land must be found on\r\nwhich to deposit it, and the act of depositing is costly, for unless\r\nit is beaten together so as to exclude the air, an intolerable\r\nnuisance arises from it. The cost of haulage and deposit on land\r\nvaries, according to the district, from 1s. to 1s. 6d. a ton. In\r\nWidnes it is about 1s.\r\n\r\nIn the Newcastle district the practice is to carry this material out\r\nto sea at a cost of about 4d. a ton.\r\n\r\nMr. Chance's process for the recovery of sulphur from the waste\r\nsignalizes the centenary of the Leblanc process; Parnell and Simpson\r\nare following in his wake, and lately Mr. F. Gossage, of Widnes, has\r\nbeen working on a process for the production of alkali, which enables\r\nhim to save the sulphur of the sulphuric acid. In his process a\r\nmixture of 70 parts Leblanc salt cake (sulphate of soda) and 30 parts\r\ncommon salt is mixed with coal and heated in a furnace, and so reduced\r\nto sulphide of sodium. The resulting \"ash\" is then dissolved in water\r\nand exposed to the action of carbonic acid, when sulphureted hydrogen\r\nis given off, to be dealt with as in Mr. Chance's sulphur process,\r\nwhile bicarbonate of soda is formed and separates by precipitation\r\nfrom the solution of undecomposed common salt.\r\n\r\nEre long it is expected this new method will be in active operation in\r\nsome Leblanc works, the plant of which will, in all probability, be\r\nutilized. It has these great advantages: The absence of lime, the\r\nrecovery of the sulphur used in the first instance and the consequent\r\nabsence of the objectionable tank waste. Thus a bright promise is held\r\nout that the days of alkali waste are numbered, and that the air in\r\ncertain parts of Lancashire will be more balmy than it has been in the\r\nmemory of the oldest inhabitant.--_Chemist and Druggist._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FUELS OF THE FUTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is undeniable that in this country, at least, we are accustomed to\r\nregard coal as the chief, and, indeed, the only substance which falls\r\nto be considered under the name of fuel. In other countries, however,\r\nthe case is different. Various materials, ranging from wood to oil,\r\ncome within the category of material for the production of heat. The\r\nquestion of fuel, it may be remarked, has a social, an antiquarian,\r\nand a chemical interest. In the first place, the inquiry whether or\r\nnot our supplies of coal will hold out for say the next hundred\r\nthousand years, or for a much more limited period only, has been very\r\noften discussed by sociologists and by geological authorities.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is clear that as man advances in the practice of civilized\r\narts, his dependence upon fuel becomes of more and more intimate\r\ncharacter. He not merely demands fire wherewith to cook his food, and\r\nto raise his own temperature or that of his dwelling, but requires\r\nfuel for the thousand and one manufacturing operations in which he is\r\nperpetually engaged. It is obvious that without fuel civilized life\r\nwould practically come to an end. We cannot take the shortest journey\r\nby rail or steamboat without a tacit dependence upon a fuel supply;\r\nand the failure of this supply would therefore mean and imply the\r\nextinction of all the comforts and conveniences on which we are\r\naccustomed to rely as aids to easy living in these latter days. Again,\r\nsocially regarded, man is the only animal that practices the\r\nfire-making habit. Even the highest apes, who will sit round the fire\r\nwhich a traveler has just left, and enjoy the heat, do not appear to\r\nhave developed any sense or idea of keeping up the fire by casting\r\nfresh fuel upon it. It seems fairly certain, then, that we may define\r\nman as being a \"fuel-employing animal,\" and in so doing be within the\r\nbounds of certitude. He may be, and often is, approached by other\r\nanimals in respect of many of his arts and practices. Birds weave nest\r\nmaterials, ants make--and maul--slaves, beavers build dams, and other\r\nanimals show the germs and beginnings of human contrivances for aiding\r\nthe processes of life, but as yet no animal save man lights and\r\nmaintains a fire. That the fire-making habit must have dawned very\r\nearly in human history appears to be proved by the finding of ashes\r\nand other evidences of the presence of fire among the remains and\r\ntraces of primitive man.\r\n\r\nAll we know, also, concerning the history of savage tribes teaches us\r\nthat humanity is skillful, even in very rude stages of its progress,\r\nin the making of fire. The contrivances for obtaining fire are many\r\nand curious in savage life, while, once attained, this art seems to\r\nhave not only formed a constant accompaniment but probably also a\r\ndetermining cause in the evolution of civilization. Wood, the fat of\r\nanimals, and even the oils expressed from plants, probably all became\r\nknown to man as convenient sources of fuel in prehistoric times. From\r\nthe incineration of wood to the use of peat and coal would prove an\r\neasy stage in the advance toward present day practices, and with the\r\nattainment of coal as a fuel the first great era in man's fire-making\r\nhabits may be said to end.\r\n\r\nBeyond the coal stage, however, lies the more or less distinctively\r\nmodern one of the utilization of gas and oil for fuel. The existence\r\nof great natural centers, or underground stores, of gas and oil is\r\nprobably no new fact. We read in the histories of classic chroniclers\r\nof the blazing gases which were wont to issue from the earth, and to\r\ninspire feelings of superstitious awe in the minds of beholders. Only\r\nwithin a few years, however, have geologists been able to tell us much\r\nor anything regarding these reservoirs of natural fuel which have\r\nbecome famous in America and in the Russian province of Baku.\r\n\r\nFor example, it is now known that three products--gas, oil, and salt\r\nor brine--lie within natural receptacles formed by the rock strata in\r\nthe order of their weight. This law, as has well been said, forms the\r\nfoundation of all successful boring experiments, and the search for\r\nnatural fuel, therefore, becomes as easy and as reliable a duty as\r\nthat for artesian water or for coal. The great oil fever of the West\r\nwas attended at first, as Professor M'Gee tells us, with much waste of\r\nthe product. Wells were sunk everywhere, and the oil overflowed the\r\nland, tainting the rivers, poisoning the air, and often driving out\r\nthe prospectors from the field of discovery. In Baku accidents and\r\ncatastrophes have, similarly, been of frequent occurrence. We read of\r\npetroleum flowing from the ground in jets 200 feet high, and as thick\r\nas a man's body; we learn how it swept away the huge cranes and other\r\nmachinery, and how, as it flowed away from the orifices, its course\r\nwas marked by the formation of rivers of oil many miles in length.\r\n\r\nIn America the pressure of rock gas has burst open stills weighing\r\nover a ton, and has rushed through huge iron tanks and split open the\r\npipes wherewith it was sought to control its progress. The roar of\r\nthis great stream of natural gas was heard for miles around as it\r\nescaped from the outlet, and when it was ignited the pillar of flame\r\nillumined the surrounding country over a radius extending in some\r\ncases to forty miles. It is clear that man having tapped the earth's\r\nstores of natural fuel, stood in danger of having unloosed a monster\r\nwhose power he seemed unable to control. Yet, as the sequel will show,\r\nscience has been able to tackle with success the problems of mastering\r\nthe force and of utilizing the energy which are thus locked up within\r\nthe crust of the globe.\r\n\r\nAs regards the chemistry of rock gas, we may remark in the first place\r\nthat this natural product ranks usually as light carbureted hydrogen\r\ngas. In this respect it is not unlike the marsh gas with which\r\neveryone is familiar, which is found bubbling up from swamps and\r\nmorasses, and which constitutes the \"will o' the wisp\" of romance. In\r\nrock gas, marsh gas itself is actually found in the proportion of\r\nabout 93 per cent. The composition of marsh gas is very simple. It\r\nconsists of the two elements carbon and hydrogen united in certain\r\nproportions, indicated chemically by the symbol CH4. We find, in fact,\r\nthat rock gas possesses a close relationship, chemically speaking,\r\nwith many familiar carbon compounds, and of these latter, petroleum\r\nitself, asphaltum, coal, jet, graphite or plumbago, and even the\r\ndiamond itself--which is only crystallized carbon after all--are\r\nexcellent examples.\r\n\r\nThe differences between these substances really consist in the degree\r\nof fixing of the carbon or solid portion of the product, as it were,\r\nwhich exists. Thus in coal and jet the carbon is of stable character,\r\nsuch as we might expect to result from the slow decomposition of\r\nvegetable matter, and the products of this action are not volatile or\r\nliable to be suddenly dissociated or broken up. On the other hand,\r\nwhen we deal with the _hydrocarbons_ as they are called, in the shape\r\nof rock gas, naphtha, petroleum, tar, asphaltum, and similar\r\nsubstances, we see how the carbon has become subordinated to the\r\nhydrogen part of the compounds, with the result of rendering them more\r\nor less unstable in their character. As Professor M'Gee has shown us,\r\nthere is in truth a graduated series leading us from the marsh gas and\r\nrock gas as the lightest members of this class of compounds onward\r\nthrough the semi-gaseous naphtha to the fluid petroleum, the\r\nsemi-fluid tar, the solid asphaltum, and the rigid and brittle\r\nsubstance known as albertite, with other and allied products. Having\r\nsaid so much regarding the chemistry of the fuels of the future, we\r\nmay now pass to consider their geological record. A somewhat curious\r\ndistribution awaits the man of science in this latter respect. Most\r\nreaders are aware that the geologists are accustomed to classify\r\nrocks, according to their relative age, into three great groups, known\r\nrespectively as the primary, secondary, and tertiary periods. In the\r\nsecondary period we do not appear to meet with the fuels of the\r\nfuture, but as far back as the Devonian or old Red Sandstone period,\r\nand in the still older Silurian rocks, stores of gas and petroleum\r\nabound. In the latest or tertiary period, again, we come upon nearly\r\nall the forms of fuels we have already specified.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of this geological distribution of the fuels is entirely\r\nfortuitous. Dr. M'Gee tells us that as their formation depended on\r\nlocal conditions (such as plant growth), and as we have no means of\r\njudging why such local conditions occurred within any given area, so\r\nmust we regard the existence of fuel products in particular regions as\r\nbeyond explanation. Of one point, however, we are well assured, namely\r\nthat the volume of the fuels of the future is developed in an inverse\r\nproportion to their geological age. The proportionate volume, as it\r\nhas been expressed, diminishes progressively as the geological scale\r\nis descended. Again, the weight of the fuels varies directly with\r\ntheir age; for it is in the older formation of any series that we come\r\nupon the oils and tars and asphaltum, while the marsh gas exists in\r\nlater and more recently formed deposits. Further geological research\r\nshows us that the American gas fields exist each as an inverted trough\r\nor dome, a conformation due, of course, to the bending and twisting of\r\nthe rocks by the great underground heat forces of the world. The\r\nporous part of the dome may be sandstone or limestone, and above this\r\nportion lie shales, which are the opposite of porous in texture. The\r\ndome, further, contains gas above, naphtha in the middle, and\r\npetroleum below, while last of all comes water, which is usually very\r\nsalt. In the Indiana field, however, we are told that the oils lie\r\nnear the springing or foundation of the arch of the dome, and at its\r\ncrown gas exists, and overlies brine.\r\n\r\nA very important inquiry, in relation to the statement that upon the\r\nproducts whose composition and history have just been described the\r\nfuel supply of the future will depend, consists in the question of the\r\nextent and duration of these natural gas and oil reservoirs. If we are\r\nbeginning to look forward to a time when our coal supply will have\r\nbeen worked out, it behooves us to ask whether or not the supply of\r\nnatural gas and oil is practically illimitable. The geologist will be\r\nable to give the coming man some degree of comfort on this point, by\r\ninforming him that there seems to be no limit to the formation of the\r\nfuel of the future.\r\n\r\nNatural gas is being manufactured to-day by nature on a big scale.\r\nWherever plant material has been entombed in the rock formations, and\r\nwherever its decomposition proceeds, as proceed it must, there natural\r\ngas is being made. So that with the prospect of coal becoming as rare\r\nas the dodo itself, the world, we are told by scientists, may still\r\nregard with complacency the failure of our ordinary carbon supply. The\r\nnatural gases and oils of the world will provide the human race with\r\ncombustible material for untold ages--such at least is the opinion of\r\nthose who are best informed on the subject. For one thing, we are\r\nreminded that gas is found to be the most convenient and most\r\neconomical of fuels. Rock gas is being utilized abroad even now in\r\nmanufacturing processes. Dr. M'Gee says that even if the natural\r\nsupply of rock gas were exhausted to-morrow, manufacturers of glass,\r\ncertain grades of iron, and other products would substitute an\r\nartificial gas for the natural product rather than return to coal. He\r\nadds that \"enormous waste would thereby be prevented, the gas by which\r\nthe air of whole counties in coke-burning regions is contaminated\r\nwould be utilized, and the carbon of the dense smoke clouds by which\r\nmanufacturing cities are overshadowed would be turned to good\r\naccount.\" So that, as regards the latter point, even Mr. Ruskin with\r\nhis horror of the black smoke of to-day and of the disfigurement of\r\nsky and air might become a warm ally of the fuel of the future. The\r\nchemist in his laudation of rock gas and allied products is only\r\nre-echoing, when all is said and done, the modern eulogy pronounced on\r\nordinary coal gas as a cooking and heating medium.\r\n\r\nWe are within the mark when we say that the past five years alone have\r\nwitnessed a wonderful extension in the use of gas in the kitchen and\r\nelsewhere. It would be singular, indeed, if we should happen to be\r\nalready anticipating the fuel of the future by such a practice.\r\nWhether or not this is the case, it is at least satisfactory for\r\nmankind to know that the mother earth will not fail him when he comes\r\nto demand a substitute for coal. I may be too early even to think of\r\nthe day of extinction; but we may regard that evil day with\r\ncomplacency in face of the stores of fuel husbanded for us within the\r\nrock foundations of our planet.--_Glasgow Herald._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTABLE ELECTRIC LIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe famous house of MM. Sautter, Lemonnier & Co. takes a conspicuous\r\npart in the Paris exhibition, and from the wide range of its\r\nspecialties exhibits largely in three important branches of industry:\r\nmechanics, electricity, and the optics of lighthouses and projectors.\r\nIn these three branches MM. Sautter, Lemonnier & Co. occupy a leading\r\nposition in all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe invention of the aplanetic projector, due to Col. Mangin, was a\r\nclever means of overcoming difficulties, practically insurmountable,\r\nthat were inseparable from the construction of parabolic mirrors; this\r\ncontributed chiefly to the success of MM. Sautter, Lemonnier & Co. in\r\nthis direction. The firm has produced more than 1,500 of these\r\napparatus, representing a value of nearly £500,000, for the French and\r\nother governments.\r\n\r\nBesides the great projector, which forms the central and crowning\r\nobject of the exhibit of MM. Sautter, Lemonnier & Co. in the machinery\r\nhall, the firm exhibits a projector 90 centimeters in diameter mounted\r\non a crane traveling on wheels, in the pavilion of the War Department.\r\nThe lamp used for this apparatus has a luminous value of 6,000\r\ncarcels, with a current of 100 amperes; the amplifying power of the\r\nmirror is 2,025, which gives an intensity of ten millions to twelve\r\nmillions of carcels to the beam.\r\n\r\nProjectors used for field work are mounted on a portable carriage,\r\nwhich also contains the electric generator and the motor driving it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILITARY PORTABLE ELECTRIC LIGHT AT THE PARIS\r\nEXHIBITION.]\r\n\r\nIt consists of a tubular boiler (Dion, Bouton & Trepardoux system).\r\nThis generator is easily taken to pieces, cleaned, and repaired, and\r\nsteam can be raised to working pressure in 20 minutes. The mechanical\r\nand electrical part of the apparatus consists of a Parsons\r\nturbo-motor, of which MM. Sautter, Lemonnier & Co. possess the license\r\nin France for application to military and naval purposes. The speed of\r\nthe motor is 9,000 revolutions per minute, and the dynamo is driven\r\ndirect from it; at this speed it gives a current of 100 amperes with\r\nand from 55 to 70 volts; the intensity of the light is from 5,500 to\r\n6,000 carcels. The carriage upon which the whole of this apparatus is\r\nmounted is carried on four wheels, made of wood with gun metal\r\nmountings. These are more easy to repair when in service than if they\r\nwere wholly of iron. The weight of the carriage is three\r\ntons.--_Engineering._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRIC MOTOR FOR ALTERNATING CURRENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nProf. Galileo Ferraris, of Turin, who has carefully studied\r\nalternating currents and secondary transformers, has constructed a\r\nlittle motor based upon an entirely new principle, which is as\r\nfollows: If we take two inductive fields developed by two bobbins, the\r\naxes of which cut each other at right angles, and a pole placed at the\r\nvertex of the angle, this pole will be subjected to the simultaneous\r\naction of the two bobbins, and the resultant of the magnetic actions\r\nwill be represented in magnitude and direction by the diagonal of the\r\nparallelogram, two consecutive sides of which have for their length\r\nthe intensity of the two fields, and for their direction the axes of\r\nthe two bobbins.\r\n\r\nIf into each of these bobbins we send alternating currents having\r\nbetween one bobbin and the other a difference of phase of 90°, the\r\nextremity of the resultant will describe a circle having for its\r\ncenter the vertex of the right angle.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of a fixed pole, we use a metal cylinder movable on its\r\naxis, we shall obtain a continuous rotatory motion of this part, and\r\nthe direction of the movement will change when we interchange the\r\ndifference of phase in the exciting currents. This rotatory movement\r\nis not due to the Foucault currents, for the metal cylinder may\r\nconsist of plates of iron insulated from each other.\r\n\r\nIn order to realize the production of these fields, several means can\r\nbe employed: The current is sent from an alternating current machine\r\ninto the primary circuit of a transformer and thence into one of the\r\nbobbins, the other being supplied by means of the secondary current of\r\nthe transformer. A resistance introduced into the circuit will produce\r\nthe required difference of phase, and the equality of the intensities\r\nof the fields will be obtained by multiplying the number of turns of\r\nthe secondary wire on the bobbin. Moreover, the two bobbins may be\r\nsupplied by the secondary current of a transformer by producing the\r\ndifference of phase, as in the first case.\r\n\r\nIn the motor constructed by Prof. Ferraris the armature consisted of a\r\ncopper cylinder measuring 7 centimeters in diameter and 15 centimeters\r\nin length, movable on its axis. The inductors were formed of two\r\ngroups of two bobbins. The bobbins which branched off from the primary\r\ncircuit of a Gaulard transformer, and were connected in series,\r\ncomprised 196 spirals with a resistance of 13 ohms; the bobbins\r\ncomprising the secondary circuit were coupled in parallel, and had 504\r\nspirals with 3.43 ohms resistance. In order to produce the difference\r\nof phase, a resistance of 17 ohms was introduced into the second\r\ncircuit, when the dynamo produced a current of 9 amperes with 80\r\ninversions per second. Under these conditions the available work\r\nmeasured on the axis of the motor was found for different speeds:\r\nRevolutions per minute: 262--400--546--650--722--770. Watts measured\r\nat the brake: 1.32--2.12--2.55--2.77--2.55--2.40. The maximum\r\nrendering corresponds to a speed of rotation of 650 revolutions, and\r\nProf. Ferraris attributes the loss of work for higher speeds to the\r\nvibrations to which the machine is exposed. At present the apparatus\r\nis but a laboratory one.--_Bulletin International de l'Electricite._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRIC AGE.\r\n\r\nBy CHARLES CARLETON COFFIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe application of electricity for our convenience and comfort is one\r\nof the marvels of the age. Never in the history of the world has there\r\nbeen so rapid a development of an occult science. Prior to 1819 very\r\nlittle was known in regard to magnetism and electricity. During that\r\nyear Oersted discovered that an electric current would deflect a\r\nmagnetic needle, thus showing that there was some relationship between\r\nelectric and magnetic force. A few months later, Arago and Sir Humphry\r\nDavy, independently of each other, discovered that by coiling a wire\r\naround a piece of iron, and passing an electric current through it,\r\nthe iron would possess for the time being all the properties of a\r\nmagnet. In 1825 William Sturgeon, of London, bent a piece of wire in\r\nthe form of the letter U, wound a second wire around it, and, upon\r\nconnecting it with a galvanic battery, discovered that the first wire\r\nbecame magnetic, but lost its magnetic property the moment the battery\r\nwas disconnected. The idea of a telegraphic signal came to him, but\r\nthe electric impulse, through his rude apparatus, faded out at a\r\ndistance of fifty feet. In 1830 Prof. Joseph Henry, of this country,\r\nconstructed a line of wire, one and a half miles in length, and sent a\r\ncurrent of electricity through it, ringing a bell at the farther end.\r\nThe following year Professor Faraday discovered magnetic induction.\r\nThis, in brief, is the genesis of magnetic electricity, which is the\r\nbasis of all that has been accomplished in electrical science.\r\n\r\nThe first advance after these discoveries was in the development of\r\nthe electric telegraph--the discovery in 1837, by the philosopher\r\nSteinhill, that the earth could serve as a conductor, thus requiring\r\nbut one wire in the employment of an electric current. Simultaneously\r\ncame Morse's invention of the mechanism for the telegraph in 1844,\r\nforeshadowed by Henry in the ringing of bells, thus transmitting\r\nintelligence by sound. Four years later, in 1848, Prof. M. G. Farmer,\r\nstill living in Eliot, Me., attached an electro-magnet to clockwork\r\nfor the striking of bells to give an alarm of fire. The same idea came\r\nto William F. Channing. The mechanism, constructed simply to\r\nillustrate the idea by Professor Farmer, was placed upon the roof of\r\nthe Court House in Boston, and connected with the telegraph wire\r\nleading to New York, and an alarm rung by the operator in that city.\r\nThe application of electricity for giving definite information to\r\nfiremen was first made in Boston, and it was my privilege to give the\r\nfirst alarm on the afternoon of April 12, 1852.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the last century, Benjamin Thompson, born in Woburn,\r\nMass., known to the world as Count Rumford, was in the workshop of the\r\nmilitary arsenal of the King of Bavaria in Munich, superintending the\r\nboring of a cannon. The machinery was worked by two horses. He was\r\nsurprised at the amount of heat which was generated, for when he threw\r\nthe borings into a tumbler filled with cold water, it was set to\r\nboiling, greatly to the astonishment of the workmen. Whence came the\r\nheat? What was heat? The old philosopher said that it was an element.\r\nBy experiment he discovered that a horse working two hours and twenty\r\nminutes with the boring machinery would heat nineteen pounds of water\r\nto the boiling point. He traced the heat to the horse, but with all\r\nhis acumen he did not go on with the induction to the hay and oats, to\r\nthe earth, the sunshine and rain, and so get back to the sun. One\r\nhundred years ago there was no chemical science worthy of the name, no\r\nknowledge of the constitution of plants or the properties of light and\r\nheat. The old philosophers considered light and heat to be fluids,\r\nwhich passed out of substances when they were too full. Count Rumford\r\nshowed that motion was convertible into heat, but did not trace the\r\nmotion to its source, so far as we know, in the sun.\r\n\r\nIt is only forty-six years since Professor Joule first demonstrated\r\nthe mutual relations of all the manifestations of nature's energy.\r\nThirty-nine years only have passed since he announced the great law of\r\nthe convertibility of force. He constructed a miniature churn which\r\nheld one pound of water, and connected the revolving paddle of the\r\nchurn with a wheel moved by a pound weight, wound up the weight, and\r\nset the paddle in motion. A thermometer detected the change of\r\ntemperature and a graduated scale marked the distance traversed by the\r\ndescending weight. Repeated experiments showed that a pound weight\r\nfalling 772 feet would raise the temperature of water one degree, and\r\nthat this was an unvarying law. This was transferring gravitation to\r\nheat, and the law held good when applied to electricity, magnetism,\r\nand chemical affinity, leading to the conclusion that they were\r\nseverally manifestations of one universal power.--_Congregationalist._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY ELECTRIC LIGHTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opening of the new station of the Electric Lighting Co., of Salem,\r\nMass., was recently celebrated with appropriate festivities.\r\n\r\nAmong the letters of regret from those unable to attend the opening\r\nwas the following from Prof. Moses G. Farmer:\r\n\r\n                                        \"ELIOT, Me., Aug. 5, 1889.\r\n\r\n\"_To the Salem Electric Lighting Company, Charles H. Price,\r\nPresident_:\r\n\r\n\"GENTLEMEN: It would give me great pleasure to accept your kind\r\ninvitation to be present at the opening of your new station in Salem\r\non the 8th of this present August.\r\n\r\n\"It is now thirty years since the first dwelling house in Salem was\r\nlighted by electricity. That little obscure dwelling, 11 Pearl Street,\r\nformerly owned by 'Pa' Webb, had the honor to be illuminated by the\r\neffulgent electric beam during every evening of July, 1859, as some of\r\nyour honored residents, perhaps, well remember. Mr. George D. Phippen\r\ncan doubtless testify to one or more evenings; Mr. Wm. H. Mendell, of\r\nBoston, can also add his testimony; dozens of others could also do the\r\nsame, had not some of them already passed to the 'great beyond,' among\r\nwhom I well recollect the interest taken by the late and honored Henry\r\nL. Williams, Mr. J. G. Felt, and I do not know how many others. I well\r\nremember reading some of the very finest print standing with my back\r\nto the front wall and reading by the light of a 32 candle power lamp\r\non the northernmost end of the mantel piece in the parlor; very\r\npossibly the hole in which the lamp was fastened remains to this day.\r\nIn a little closet in the rear sleeping room was a switch which could\r\nbe turned in one direction and give a beautiful glow light, while if\r\nturned in the other direction, it instantly gave as beautiful a dark.\r\nMy then 12 year old daughter used to surprise and please her visitors\r\nby suddenly turning on and off the 'glim.' It is not well to despise\r\nthe day of small things, for although the dynamo had not at that date\r\nput in an appearance, and though I used thirty-six Smee cells of six\r\ngallons capacity each, yet I demonstrated then and there that the\r\nincandescent electric light was a possibility, and although I\r\ninnocently remarked to the late Samuel W. Bates, of Boston, who with\r\nhis partner, Mr. Chauncey Smith, furnished so generously in the\r\ninterest of science, not wholly without hope of return, the funds for\r\nthe experiment, that it 'did not take much zinc,' and though Mr. Bates\r\nas naively replied, 'I notice that it takes some silver, though,'\r\nstill it was then and there heralded as the coming grand illuminant\r\nfor the dwelling. I am thankful to have lived to see my predictions\r\npartly fulfilled.\r\n\r\n\"During the early fifties I published a statement something like this:\r\n'One pound of coal will furnish gas enough to maintain a candle light\r\nfor fifteen hours. One pound of gas (the product of five pounds of\r\ncoal) will, in a good fishtail gas burner, furnish one candle light\r\nfor seventy-five hours. One pound of coal burned in a good furnace,\r\nunder a good boiler, driving a good steam engine, turning a good\r\nmagneto-electric machine, will give a candle light for one thousand\r\nhours. But if all the energy locked up in one pound of pure carbon\r\ncould be wholly converted into light, it would maintain one candle\r\nlight for more than one and a half years.'\r\n\r\n\"So, gentlemen, _nil desperandum_; there is still room for\r\nimprovement. Let your motto be 'Excelsior.' Possibly you may have\r\nalready extracted from one-fifteenth to one-twelfth of the energy\r\nstored in the pound of carbon, but hardly more. Go on, go on, and\r\nbring it so cheap as to reach the humblest dwelling when you shall\r\ncelebrate the centennial of the opening of your new station.\r\n\r\n\"I do most sincerely regret that I cannot be with you in the flesh. I\r\nam, like Ixion of old, confined to a wheel (chair in my case), cannot\r\nwalk, cannot even stand; hence, owing to the impairment of my\r\nunderstanding (???), I must wish you all the enjoyments of the\r\nevening, and gladly content myself that you have made so much\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n                    \"Very truly yours, MOSES G.

[Reprinted from the _Liverpool University College\r\n    Magazine_.]]\r\n\r\nBy Prof. OLIVER LODGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo persons occupied in other branches of learning, and not directly\r\nengaged in the study of physical science, some rumor must probably\r\nhave traveled of the stir and activity manifest at the present time\r\namong the votaries of that department of knowledge.\r\n\r\nIt may serve a useful purpose if I try and explain to outsiders what\r\nthis stir is mainly about, and why it exists. There is a proximate and\r\nthere is an ultimate cause. The proximate cause is certain experiments\r\nexhibiting in a marked and easily recognizable way the already\r\ntheoretically predicted connection between electricity and light. The\r\nultimate cause is that we begin to feel inklings and foretastes of\r\ntheories, wider than that of gravitation, more fundamental than any\r\ntheories which have yet been advanced; theories which if successfully\r\nworked out will carry the banner of physical science far into the dark\r\ncontinent of metaphysics, and will illuminate with a clear philosophy\r\nmuch that is at present only dimly guessed. More explicitly, we begin\r\nto perceive chinks of insight into the natures of electricity, of\r\nether, of elasticity, and even of matter itself. We begin to have a\r\nkinetic theory of the physical universe.\r\n\r\nWe are living, not in a Newtonian, but at the beginning of a perhaps\r\nstill greater Thomsonian era. Greater, not because any one man is\r\nprobably greater than Newton,[2] but because of the stupendousness of\r\nthe problems now waiting to be solved. There are a dozen men of great\r\nmagnitude, either now living or but recently deceased, to whom what we\r\nnow know toward these generalizations is in some measure due, and the\r\nepoch of complete development may hardly be seen by those now alive.\r\nIt is proverbially rash to attempt prediction, but it seems to me that\r\nit may well take a period of fifty years for these great strides to be\r\nfully accomplished. If it does, and if progress goes on at anything\r\nlike its present rate, the aspect of physical science bequeathed to\r\nthe latter half of the twentieth century will indeed excite\r\nadmiration, and when the populace are sufficiently educated to\r\nappreciate it, will form a worthy theme for poetry, for oratorios, and\r\nfor great works of art.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: Though, indeed, a century hence it may be premature\r\n    to offer an opinion on such a point.]\r\n\r\nTo attempt to give any idea of the drift of progress in all the\r\ndirections which I have hastily mentioned, to attempt to explain the\r\nbeginnings of the theories of elasticity and of matter, would take too\r\nlong, and might only result in confusion. I will limit myself chiefly\r\nto giving some notion of what we have gained in knowledge concerning\r\nelectricity, ether, and light. Even that is far too much. I find I\r\nmust confine myself principally to light, and only treat of the others\r\nas incidental to that.\r\n\r\nFor now well nigh a century we have had a wave theory of light; and a\r\nwave theory of light is quite certainly true. It is directly\r\ndemonstrable that light consists of waves of some kind or other, and\r\nthat these waves travel at a certain well-known velocity, seven times\r\nthe circumference of the earth per second, taking eight minutes on the\r\njourney from the sun to the earth. This propagation in time of an\r\nundulatory disturbance necessarily involves a medium. If waves setting\r\nout from the sun exist in space eight minutes before striking our\r\neyes, there must necessarily be in space some medium in which they\r\nexist and which conveys them. Waves we cannot have unless they be\r\nwaves in something.\r\n\r\nNo ordinary medium is competent to transmit waves at anything like the\r\nspeed of light; hence the luminiferous medium must be a special kind\r\nof substance, and it is called the ether. The _luminiferous_ ether it\r\nused to be called, because the conveyance of light was all it was then\r\nknown to be capable of; but now that it is known to do a variety of\r\nother things also, the qualifying adjective may be dropped.\r\n\r\nWave motion in ether, light certainly is; but what does one mean by\r\nthe term wave? The popular notion is, I suppose, of something heaving\r\nup and down, or, perhaps, of something breaking on the shore in which\r\nit is possible to bathe. But if you ask a mathematician what he means\r\nby a wave, he will probably reply that the simplest wave is\r\n\r\n  y = a sin (p t - n x),\r\n\r\nand he might possibly refuse to give any other answer.\r\n\r\nAnd in refusing to give any other answer than this, or its equivalent\r\nin ordinary words, he is entirely justified; that is what is meant by\r\nthe term wave, and nothing less general would be all-inclusive.\r\n\r\nTranslated into ordinary English the phrase signifies \"a disturbance\r\nperiodic both in space and time.\" Anything thus doubly periodic is a\r\nwave; and all waves, whether in air as sound waves, or in ether as\r\nlight waves, or on the surface of water as ocean waves, are\r\ncomprehended in the definition.\r\n\r\nWhat properties are essential to a medium capable of transmitting wave\r\nmotion? Roughly we may say two--_elasticity_ and _inertia_. Elasticity\r\nin some form, or some equivalent of it, in order to be able to store\r\nup energy and effect recoil; inertia, in order to enable the disturbed\r\nsubstance to overshoot the mark and oscillate beyond its place of\r\nequilibrium to and fro. Any medium possessing these two properties can\r\ntransmit waves, and unless a medium possesses these properties in some\r\nform or other, or some equivalent for them, it may be said with\r\nmoderate security to be incompetent to transmit waves. But if we make\r\nthis latter statement, one must be prepared to extend to the terms\r\nelasticity and inertia their very largest and broadest signification,\r\nso as to include any possible kind of restoring force and any possible\r\nkind of persistence of motion respectively.\r\n\r\nThese matters may be illustrated in many ways, but perhaps a simple\r\nloaded lath or spring in a vise will serve well enough. Pull aside one\r\nend, and its elasticity tends to make it recoil; let it go, and its\r\ninertia causes it to overshoot its normal position; both causes\r\ntogether cause it to swing to and fro till its energy is exhausted. A\r\nregular series of such springs at equal intervals in space, set going\r\nat regular intervals of time one after the other, gives you at once a\r\nwave motion and appearance which the most casual observer must\r\nrecognize as such. A series of pendulums will do just as well. Any\r\nwave-transmitting medium must similarly possess some form of\r\nelasticity and of inertia.\r\n\r\nBut now proceed to ask what is this ether which in the case of light\r\nis thus vibrating? What corresponds to the elastic displacement and\r\nrecoil of the spring or pendulum? What corresponds to the inertia\r\nwhereby it overshoots its mark? Do we know these properties in the\r\nether in any other way?\r\n\r\nThe answer, given first by Clerk Maxwell, and now reiterated and\r\ninsisted on by experiments performed in every important laboratory in\r\nthe world, is:\r\n\r\nThe elastic displacement corresponds to electrostatic charge (roughly\r\nspeaking, to electricity).\r\n\r\nThe inertia corresponds to magnetism.\r\n\r\nThis is the basis of the modern electro-magnetic theory of light. Now\r\nlet me illustrate electrically how this can be.\r\n\r\nThe old and familiar operation of charging a Leyden jar--the storing\r\nup of energy in a strained dielectric, any electrostatic charging\r\nwhatever--is quite analogous to the drawing aside of our flexible\r\nspring. It is making use of the elasticity of the ether to produce a\r\ntendency to recoil. Letting go the spring is analogous to permitting a\r\ndischarge of the jar--permitting the strained dielectric to recover\r\nitself, the electrostatic disturbance to subside.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all the experiments of electrostatics, ethereal elasticity\r\nis manifest.\r\n\r\nNext consider inertia. How would one illustrate the fact that water,\r\nfor instance, possesses inertia--the power of persisting in motion\r\nagainst obstacles--the power of possessing kinetic energy? The most\r\ndirect way would be to take a stream of water and try suddenly to stop\r\nit. Open a water tap freely and then suddenly shut it. The impetus or\r\nmomentum of the stopped water makes itself manifest by a violent shock\r\nto the pipe, with which everybody must be familiar. The momentum of\r\nwater is utilized by engineers in the \"water ram.\"\r\n\r\nA precisely analogous experiment in electricity is what Faraday called\r\n\"the extra current.\" Send a current through a coil of wire round a\r\npiece of iron, or take any other arrangement for developing powerful\r\nmagnetism, and then suddenly stop the current by breaking the circuit.\r\nA violent flash occurs if the stoppage is sudden enough, a flash which\r\nmeans the bursting of the insulating air partition by the accumulated\r\nelectro-magnetic momentum.\r\n\r\nBriefly, we may say that nearly all electro-magnetic experiments\r\nillustrate the fact of ethereal inertia.\r\n\r\nNow return to consider what happens when a charged conductor (say a\r\nLeyden jar) is discharged. The recoil of the strained dielectric\r\ncauses a current, the inertia of this current causes it to overshoot\r\nthe mark, and for an instant the charge of the jar is reversed; the\r\ncurrent now flows backward and charges the jar up as at first; back\r\nagain flows the current, and so on, charging and reversing the charge\r\nwith rapid oscillations until the energy is all dissipated into heat.\r\nThe operation is precisely analogous to the release of a strained\r\nspring or to the plucking of a stretched string.\r\n\r\nBut the discharging body thus thrown into strong electrical vibration\r\nis embedded in the all-pervading ether, and we have just seen that the\r\nether possesses the two properties requisite for the generation and\r\ntransmission of waves--viz., elasticity and inertia or density; hence,\r\njust as a tuning fork vibrating in air excites aerial waves or sound,\r\nso a discharging Leyden jar in ether excites ethereal waves or light.\r\n\r\nEthereal waves can therefore be actually produced by direct electrical\r\nmeans. I discharge here a jar, and the room is for an instant filled\r\nwith light. With light, I say, though you can see nothing. You can see\r\nand hear the spark indeed--but that is a mere secondary disturbance we\r\ncan for the present ignore--I do not mean any secondary disturbance. I\r\nmean the true ethereal waves emitted by the electric oscillation going\r\non in the neighborhood of this recoiling dielectric. You pull aside\r\nthe prong of a tuning fork and let it go; vibration follows and sound\r\nis produced. You charge a Leyden jar and let it discharge; vibration\r\nfollows and light is excited.\r\n\r\nIt is light just as good as any other light. It travels at the same\r\npace, it is reflected and refracted according to the same laws; every\r\nexperiment known to optics can be performed with this ethereal\r\nradiation electrically produced, and yet you cannot see it. Why not?\r\nFor no fault of the light; the fault (if there be a fault) is in the\r\neye. The retina is incompetent to respond to these vibrations--they\r\nare too slow. The vibrations set up when this large jar is discharged\r\nare from a hundred thousand to a million per second, but that is too\r\nslow for the retina. It responds only to vibrations between 4,000\r\nbillions and 7,000 billions per second. The vibrations are too quick\r\nfor the ear, which responds only to vibrations between 40 and 40,000\r\nper second. Between the highest audible and the lowest visible\r\nvibrations there has been hitherto a great gap, which these electric\r\noscillations go far to fill up. There has been a great gap simply\r\nbecause we have no intermediate sense organ to detect rates of\r\nvibration between 40,000 and 4,000,000,000,000,000 per second. It was,\r\ntherefore, an unexplored territory. Waves have been there all the time\r\nin any quantity, but we have not thought about them nor attended to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt happens that I have myself succeeded in getting electric\r\noscillations so slow as to be audible. The lowest I have got at\r\npresent are 125 per second, and for some way above this the sparks\r\nemit a musical note; but no one has yet succeeded in directly making\r\nelectric oscillations which are visible, though indirectly every one\r\ndoes it when they light a candle.\r\n\r\nHere, however, is an electric oscillator, which vibrates 300 million\r\ntimes a second, and emits ethereal waves a yard long. The whole range\r\nof vibrations between musical tones and some thousand million per\r\nsecond is now filled up.\r\n\r\nThese electro-magnetic waves have long been known on the side of\r\ntheory, but interest in them has been immensely quickened by the\r\ndiscovery of a receiver or detector for them. The great though simple\r\ndiscovery by Hertz of an \"electric eye,\" as Sir W. Thomson calls it,\r\nmakes experiments on these waves for the first time easy or even\r\npossible. We have now a sort of artificial sense organ for their\r\nappreciation--an electric arrangement which can virtually \"see\" these\r\nintermediate rates of vibration.\r\n\r\nThe Hertz receiver is the simplest thing in the world--nothing but a\r\nbit of wire or a pair of bits of wire adjusted so that when immersed\r\nin strong electric radiation they give minute sparks across a\r\nmicroscopic air gap.\r\n\r\nThe receiver I have here is adapted for the yard-long waves emitted\r\nfrom this small oscillator; but for the far longer waves emitted by a\r\ndischarging Leyden jar an excellent receiver is a gilt wall paper or\r\nother interrupted metallic surface. The waves falling upon the\r\nmetallic surface are reflected, and in the act of reflection excite\r\nelectric currents, which cause sparks. Similarly, gigantic solar waves\r\nmay produce auroræ; and minute waves from a candle do electrically\r\ndisturb the retina.\r\n\r\nThe smaller waves are, however, far the most interesting and the most\r\ntractable to ordinary optical experiments. From a small oscillator,\r\nwhich may be a couple of small cylinders kept sparking into each other\r\nend to end by an induction coil, waves are emitted on which all manner\r\nof optical experiments can be performed.\r\n\r\nThey can be reflected by plain sheets of metal, concentrated by\r\nparabolic reflectors, refracted by prisms, concentrated by lenses. I\r\nhave at the college a large lens of pitch, weighing over three\r\nhundredweight, for concentrating them to a focus. They can be made to\r\nshow the phenomenon of interference, and thus have their wave length\r\naccurately measured. They are stopped by all conductors and\r\ntransmitted by all insulators. Metals are opaque, but even imperfect\r\ninsulators such as wood or stone are strikingly transparent, and waves\r\nmay be received in one room from a source in another, the door between\r\nthe two being shut.\r\n\r\nThe real nature of metallic opacity and of transparency has long been\r\nclear in Maxwell's theory of light, and these electrically produced\r\nwaves only illustrate and bring home the well known facts. The\r\nexperiments of Hertz are in fact the apotheosis of that theory.\r\n\r\nThus, then, in every way Maxwell's 1865 brilliant perception of the\r\nreal nature of light is abundantly justified; and for the first time\r\nwe have a true theory of light, no longer based upon analogy with\r\nsound, nor upon a hypothetical jelly or elastic solid.\r\n\r\nLight is an electro-magnetic disturbance of the ether. Optics is a\r\nbranch of electricity. Outstanding problems in optics are being\r\nrapidly solved now that we have the means of definitely exciting light\r\nwith a full perception of what we are doing and of the precise mode of\r\nits vibration.\r\n\r\nIt remains to find out how to shorten down the waves--to hurry up the\r\nvibration until the light becomes visible. Nothing is wanted but\r\nquicker modes of vibrations. Smaller oscillators must be used--very\r\nmuch smaller--oscillators not much bigger than molecules. In all\r\nprobability--one may almost say certainly--ordinary light is the\r\nresult of electric oscillation in the molecules of hot bodies, or\r\nsometimes of bodies not hot--as in the phenomenon of phosphorescence.\r\n\r\nThe direct generation of _visible_ light by electric means, so soon as\r\nwe have learnt how to attain the necessary frequency of vibration,\r\nwill have most important practical consequences.\r\n\r\nSpeaking in this university, it is happily quite unnecessary for me to\r\nbespeak interest in a subject by any reference to possible practical\r\napplications. But any practical application of what I have dealt with\r\nthis evening is apparently so far distant as to be free from any\r\nsordid gloss of competition and company promotion, and is interesting\r\nin itself as a matter of pure science.\r\n\r\nFor consider our present methods of making artificial light; they are\r\nboth wasteful and ineffective.\r\n\r\nWe want a certain range of oscillation, between 7,000 and 4,000\r\nbillion vibrations per second; no other is useful to us, because no\r\nother has any effect upon our retina; but we do not know how to\r\nproduce vibrations of this rate. We can produce a definite vibration\r\nof one or two hundred or thousand per second; in other words, we can\r\nexcite a pure tone of definite pitch; and we can demand any desired\r\nrange of such tones continuously by means of bellows and a keyboard.\r\nWe can also (though the fact is less well known) excite momentarily\r\ndefinite ethereal vibrations of some million per second, as I have\r\nexplained at length; but we do not at present seem to know how to\r\nmaintain this rate quite continuously. To get much faster rates of\r\nvibration than this we have to fall back upon atoms. We know how to\r\nmake atoms vibrate; it is done by what we call \"heating\" the\r\nsubstance, and if we could deal with individual atoms unhampered by\r\nothers, it is possible that we might get a pure and simple mode of\r\nvibration from them. It is possible, but unlikely; for atoms, even\r\nwhen isolated, have a multitude of modes of vibration special to\r\nthemselves, of which only a few are of practical use to us, and we do\r\nnot know how to excite some without also the others. However, we do\r\nnot at present even deal with individual atoms; we treat them crowded\r\ntogether in a compact mass, so that their modes of vibration are\r\nreally infinite.\r\n\r\nWe take a lump of matter, say a carbon filament or a piece of\r\nquicklime, and by raising its temperature we impress upon its atoms\r\nhigher and higher modes of vibration, not transmuting the lower into\r\nthe higher, but superposing the higher upon the lower, until at length\r\nwe get such rates of vibration as our retina is constructed for, and\r\nwe are satisfied. But how wasteful and indirect and empirical is the\r\nprocess. We want a small range of rapid vibrations, and we know no\r\nbetter than to make the whole series leading up to them. It is as\r\nthough, in order to sound some little shrill octave of pipes in an\r\norgan, we are obliged to depress every key and every pedal, and to\r\nblow a young hurricane.\r\n\r\nI have purposely selected as examples the more perfect methods of\r\nobtaining artificial light, wherein the waste radiation is only useless\r\nand not noxious. But the old-fashioned plan was cruder even than this;\r\nit consisted simply in setting something burning; whereby not the fuel\r\nbut the air was consumed, whereby also a most powerful radiation was\r\nproduced, in the waste waves of which we were content to sit stewing,\r\nfor the sake of the minute--almost infinitesimal--fraction of it which\r\nenabled us to see.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows now, however, that combustion is not a pleasant or\r\nhealthy mode of obtaining light; but every one does not realize that\r\nneither is incandescence a satisfactory and unwasteful method which is\r\nlikely to be practiced for more than a few decades, or perhaps a\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nLook at the furnaces and boilers of a great steam engine driving a\r\ngroup of dynamos, and estimate the energy expended; and then look at\r\nthe incandescent filaments of the lamps excited by them, and estimate\r\nhow much of their radiated energy is of real service to the eye. It\r\nwill be as the energy of a pitch pipe to an entire orchestra.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say that a boy turning a handle could, if his\r\nenergy were properly directed, produce quite as much real light as is\r\nproduced by all this mass of mechanism and consumption of material.\r\nThere might, perhaps, be something contrary to the laws of nature in\r\nthus hoping to get and utilize some specific kind of radiation without\r\nthe rest, but Lord Rayleigh has shown in a short communication to the\r\nBritish Association at York that it is not so, and that, therefore, we\r\nhave a right to try to do it.\r\n\r\nWe do not yet know how, it is true, but it is one of the things we\r\nhave got to learn.\r\n\r\nAny one looking at a common glow-worm must be struck with the fact\r\nthat not by ordinary combustion, nor yet on the steam engine and\r\ndynamo principle, is that easy light produced. Very little waste\r\nradiation is there from phosphorescent things in general. Light of the\r\nkind able to affect the retina is directly emitted; and for this, for\r\neven a large supply of this, a modicum of energy suffices.\r\n\r\nSolar radiation consists of waves of all sizes, it is true; but then\r\nsolar radiation has innumerable things to do besides making things\r\nvisible. The whole of its energy is useful. In artificial lighting\r\nnothing but light is desired; when heat is wanted it is best obtained\r\nseparately by combustion. And so soon as we clearly recognize that\r\nlight is an electric vibration, so soon shall we begin to beat about\r\nfor some mode of exciting and maintaining an electrical vibration of\r\nany required degree of rapidity. When this has been accomplished the\r\nproblem of artificial lighting will have been solved.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON PURIFICATION OF AIR BY OZONE--WITH AN ACCOUNT OF A NEW METHOD.[1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Paper read in Section C, Domestic Health, at the\r\n    Hastings Health Congress, on Friday, May 3, 1889.]\r\n\r\nBy Dr. B. W. RICHARDSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the time when I was engaged in my preliminary medical\r\nstudies--for I never admit to this day of being anything less than a\r\nmedical student--the substance called ozone became the topic of much\r\nconversation and speculation. I cannot say that ozone was a discovery\r\nof that date, for in the early part of the century Von Marum had\r\nobserved that when electrical discharges were made through oxygen in a\r\nglass cylinder inverted over water, the water rose in the cylinder as\r\nif something had either been taken away from the gas, or as if the gas\r\nitself had been condensed, and was therefore occupying a smaller\r\nspace. It had also been observed by many electricians that during a\r\npassage of the electric spark through air or oxygen, there was a\r\npeculiar emanation or odor which some compared to fresh sea air,\r\nothers to the air after a thunderstorm, when the sky has become very\r\nclear, the firmament blue, and the stars, if visible, extremely\r\nbright.\r\n\r\nBut it was not until the time, or about the time, of which I have\r\nspoken, 1846-49, that these discovered but unexplained phenomena\r\nreceived proper recognition. The distinguished physicist Schonbein\r\nfirst, if I may so say, isolated the substance which yielded the\r\nphenomena, and gave to it the name, by which it has since generally\r\nbeen known, of _ozone_, which means, to emit an odor; a name, I have\r\nalways thought, not particularly happy, but which has become,\r\npractically, so fully recognized and understood, that it would be\r\nwrong now to disturb it.\r\n\r\nSchonbein made ozone by the action of the electric spark on oxygen. He\r\ncollected it, he tested its chemical properties, he announced it to be\r\noxygen in a modified form, and he traced its action as an active\r\noxidizer of various substances, and especially of organic substances,\r\neven when they were in a state of decomposition.\r\n\r\nBut Schonbein went further than this. He argued that ozone was a\r\nnatural part of the atmosphere, and that in places where there was no\r\ndecomposition, that is to say, in places away from great towns, ozone\r\nwas present. On the high tower of a cathedral in a big city he\r\ndiscovered ozone; in the city, at the foot of the tower, he found no\r\nozone at the same time. He argued, therefore, that the ozone above was\r\nused up in purifying the town below, and so suggested quite a new\r\nexplanation of the purification of air.\r\n\r\nThe subject was very soon taken up by English observers, and I\r\nremember well a lecture upon it by Michael Faraday, in which that\r\nillustrious philosopher, confirming Schonbein, stated that he had\r\ndiscovered ozone freely on the Brighton Downs, and had found the\r\nevidence of it diminishing as he approached Brighton, until it was\r\nlost altogether in the town itself.\r\n\r\nSuch was the beginning of our knowledge of ozone, the precise nature\r\nof which has not yet been completely made out. At the present time it\r\nis held to be oxygen condensed. To use a chemical phrase, the molecule\r\nof oxygen, which in the ordinary state is composed of two atoms, is\r\ncondensed, in ozone, as three atoms. By the electric spark discharged\r\nin dry oxygen as much as 15 per cent. may, under proper conditions, be\r\nturned into ozone. Ozone has also been found to be heavier than air.\r\nProfessor Zinno says, that compared with an equal volume of air its\r\ndensity is equal to 1,658, and that it is forty-eight times heavier\r\nthan hydrogen. Heat decomposes it; at the temperature of boiling water\r\nit begins to decompose. In water it is much less soluble than oxygen,\r\nand indeed is practically insoluble; when made to bubble through\r\nboiling water, it ceases to be ozone. The oxidizing power of ozone is\r\nvery much greater than that of oxygen, and, according to Saret, when\r\nozone is decomposed, one part of it enters into combination, the other\r\nremains simply as oxygen.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that some substances, like turpentine and cinnamon,\r\nabsorb ozone and combine with it, a simple fact of much greater\r\nimportance than has ever been attached to it. I found, for instance,\r\nthat cinnamon which by exposure to the air has been made odorless and,\r\nas it is said, \"spoiled,\" can be made to reabsorb ozone and gain a\r\nkind of freshness. It is certain also that some substances which are\r\nsupposed to have disinfecting properties owe what virtues they possess\r\nto the presence of ozone.\r\n\r\nOn some grand scale ozone is formed in the air, and my former friend\r\nand colleague, the late Dr. Moffatt, of Hawarden, with whom I wrote a\r\npaper on \"Meteorology and Disease,\" read before the Epidemiological\r\nSociety in 1852-53, described what he designated ozone periods of the\r\natmosphere, connecting these with storms. When the atmospheric\r\npressure is decreasing, when with that there is increasing warmth and\r\nmoisture, and when south and southwesterly winds prevail, then ozone\r\nis active; but when the atmospheric pressure is increasing, when the\r\nair is becoming dry and cold, and north and northeasterly winds\r\nprevail, then the presence of ozone is less active. These facts have\r\nalso been put in another way, namely, that the maximum period of ozone\r\noccurs when there is greatest evaporation of water from the earth, and\r\nthe minimum when there is greatest condensation of water on the earth;\r\na theory which tallies well with the idea that ozone is most freely\r\npresent when electricity is being produced, least present when\r\nelectricity is in smallest quantity. Mr. Buchan, reporting on the\r\nobservations of the Scottish Meteorological Society, records that\r\nozone is most abundant from February to June, when the average amount\r\nis 6.0; and least from July to January, when the average is 5.7; the\r\nmaximum, 6.2, being reached in May, and the minimum, 5.3, in November.\r\nThis same excellent observer states that \"ozone is more abundant on\r\nthe sea coast than inland; in the west than the east of Great Britain;\r\nin elevated than in low situations; with southwest than with northeast\r\nwinds; in the country than in towns; and on the windward than the\r\nleeward side of towns.\"\r\n\r\nRecently a very singular hypothesis has been broached in regard to the\r\nblue color of the firmament and ozone. It has been observed that when\r\na tube is filled with ozone, the light transmitted through it is of a\r\nblue color; from which fact it is assumed that the blue color of the\r\nsky is due to the presence of this body in the higher atmospheric\r\nstrata. The hypothesis is in entire accord with the suggestion of\r\nProfessor Dove, to which Moffatt always paid the greatest respect,\r\nviz., that the source of ozone for the whole of the planet is\r\nequatorial, and that the point of development of ozone is where the\r\nterrestrial atmosphere raised to its highest altitude, at the equator,\r\nexpands out north and south in opposite directions toward the two\r\npoles, to return to the equator over the earth as the trade winds.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary for all who would understand the applications of ozone\r\nfor any purpose, whether for bleaching purposes or pure chemical\r\npurposes, or for medical or sanitary purposes, to understand these\r\npreliminary facts concerning it, facts which bring me to the\r\nparticular point to which I wish to refer to-day.\r\n\r\nIn my essay describing the model city, Hygeiopolis, it was suggested\r\nthat in every town there should be a building like a gas house, in\r\nwhich ozone should be made and stored, and from which it should be\r\ndispensed to every street or house at pleasure. This suggestion was\r\nmade as the final result of observations which had been going on since\r\nI first began to work at the subject in 1852. It occurred to me from\r\nthe moment when I first made ozone by Schonbein's method, that the\r\nvalue of it in a hygienic point of view was incalculable.\r\n\r\nTo my then young and enthusiastic mind it seemed that in ozone we had\r\na means of stopping all putrefaction, of destroying all infectious\r\nsubstances, and of actually commanding and destroying the causes which\r\nproduced the great spreading diseases; and, although increase of years\r\nand greater experience have toned down the enthusiasm, I still believe\r\nthat here one of the most useful fields for investigation remains\r\nalmost unexplored.\r\n\r\nIn my first experiments I subjected decomposing blood to ozone, and\r\nfound that the products of decomposition were instantly destroyed, and\r\nthat the fluid was rendered odorless and sweet. I discovered that the\r\nred corpuscles of fresh blood decomposed ozone, and that coagulated\r\nblood underwent a degree of solution through its action. I put dead\r\nbirds and pieces of animal substances that had undergone extreme\r\ndecomposition into atmospheres containing ozone, and observed the\r\nrapidity with which the products of decomposition were neutralized and\r\nrendered harmless. I employed ozone medicinally, by having it inhaled\r\nby persons who were suffering from foetor of the breath, and with\r\nremarkable success, and I began to employ it and have employed it ever\r\nsince (that is to say, for thirty-seven years), for purposes of\r\ndisinfection and deodorization, in close rooms, closets, and the like.\r\nI should have used it much more largely but for one circumstance,\r\nnamely, the almost impracticable difficulty of making it with\r\nsufficient ease and in sufficient quantities to meet the necessities\r\nof sanitary practice. We are often obstructed in this way. We know of\r\nsomething exceedingly useful, but we cannot utilize it. This was the\r\ncase with ozone. I hope now that difficulty is overcome. If it is, we\r\nshall start from this day on a new era in regard to ozone as an\r\ninstrument of sanitation.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, ozone was originally made by charging dry oxygen or\r\ncommon dry air with electricity from sparks or points. Afterward\r\nFaraday showed that it could be made by holding a warm glass rod in\r\nvapor of ether. Again he showed that it could be made by passing air\r\nover bright phosphorus half immersed in water. Then Siemens modified\r\nthe electric process by inventing his well known ozone tube, which\r\nconsists of a wide glass tube coated with tinfoil on its outside, and\r\nholding within it a smaller glass tube coated with tinfoil on its\r\nsurface. When a current of dry air or oxygen was passed in current\r\nbetween these two tubes, and the electric spark from a Ruhmkorf coil\r\nwas discharged by the terminal wires connected with tinfoil surfaces,\r\nozone was freely produced, and this was no doubt the best method, for\r\nby means of a double-acting hand bellows currents of ozone could be\r\ndriven over very freely. One of these tubes with hand bellows\r\nattached, which I have had in use for twenty-four years, is before the\r\nmeeting, and answers as well as ever. The practical difficulty lies in\r\nthe requirement of a battery, a large coil, and a separate bellows as\r\nwell as the tube.\r\n\r\nMy dear and most distinguished friend, the late Professor Polli, of\r\nMilan, tried to overcome the difficulties arising from the use of the\r\ncoil by making ozone chemically, namely, by the decomposition of\r\npermanganate of potassa with strong sulphuric acid. He placed the\r\npermanganate in glass vessels, moistened it gradually with the acid,\r\nand then allowed the ozone, which is formed, to diffuse into the air.\r\nIn this way he endeavored, as I had done, to purify the air of rooms,\r\nespecially those vitiated by the breaths of many people. When he\r\nvisited me, not very long before his death, he was enthusiastic as to\r\nthe success that must attend the utilization of ozone for\r\npurification, and when I expressed a practical doubt, he rallied me by\r\nsaying I must not desert my own child. At the theater La Scala, on the\r\noccasion of an unusually full attendance, Polli collected the\r\ncondensible part of the exhaled organic matter, by means of a large\r\nglass bell filled with ice and placed over the circular opening in the\r\nroof, which corresponds with the large central light. The deposit on\r\nthis bell was liquid and had a mouldy smell; was for some few days\r\nlimpid, but then became very thick and had a nauseous odor. When mixed\r\nwith a solution of one part glucose to four parts of water, and kept\r\nat a temperature of from 20° to 24° C., this liquid underwent a slow\r\nfermentation, with the formation, on the superficies, of green must;\r\nduring the same period of time, and placed under the same conditions,\r\na similar glucose solution underwent no change whatever.\r\n\r\nBy the use of his ozone bottles Polli believed that he had supplied a\r\nmeans most suitable for directly destroying in the air miasmatic\r\nprinciples, without otherwise interfering with the respiratory\r\nfunctions. The ozonized air had neither a powerful nor an offensive\r\nsmell, and it might be easily and economically made. The smell of\r\nozone was scarcely perceptible, and was far less disagreeable than\r\nchlorine, bromine, and iodine, while it was more efficacious than\r\neither of these; if, therefore, its application as a purifier of a\r\nvitiated air succeeded, it would probably supply all the exigences of\r\ndefective ventilation in crowded atmospheres. In confined places\r\nvessels might be placed containing mixtures of permanganate of potassa\r\nor soda and acid in proper quantities, and of which the duration of\r\nthe action was known; or sulphuric acid could be dropped upon the\r\npermanganate.\r\n\r\nThis idea of applying ozone was no doubt very ingenious, and in the\r\nbottles before us on the table, which have been prepared in Hastings\r\nby Mr. Rossiter, we see it in operation. The disadvantages of the plan\r\nare that manipulation with strong sulphuric acid is never an agreeable\r\nor safe process, and that the ozone evolved cannot be on a large scale\r\nwithout considerable trouble.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 Dr. Lender published a process for the production of ozone. In\r\nthis process he used equal parts of manganese, permanganate of potash,\r\nand oxalic acid. When this mixture is placed in contact with water,\r\nozone is quickly generated. For a room of medium size two spoonfuls of\r\nthis powder, placed in a dish and occasionally diluted with water,\r\nwould be sufficient. As the ozone is developed, it disinfects the\r\nsurrounding air without producing cough.\r\n\r\nLender's process is very useful when ozone is wanted on a limited\r\nscale. We have some of it here prepared by Mr. Rossiter, and it\r\nanswers exceedingly well; but it would be impossible to generate\r\nsufficient ozone by this plan for the large application that would be\r\nrequired should it come into general use. The process deserves to be\r\nremembered, and the physician may find it valuable as a means by which\r\nozone may be medically applied, to wounds, or by inhalation when there\r\nare foetid exhalations from the mouth or nostrils.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW METHOD.\r\n\r\nFor the past ten or fifteen years the manufacture of ozone, for the\r\nreasons related above, has remained in abeyance, and it is to a new\r\nmode, which will, I trust, mark another stage of advancement, that I\r\nnow wish to direct attention. Some years since, Mr. Wimshurst, a most\r\nable electrician, invented the electrical machine which goes by his\r\nname. The machine, as will be seen from the specimen of it on the\r\ntable, looks something like the old electrical machine, but differs in\r\nthat there is no friction, and that the plates of glass with their\r\nmetal sectors, separated a little distance from each other, revolve,\r\nwhen the handle of the machine is turned, in opposite directions. The\r\nmachine when it is in good working order (and it is very easily kept\r\nin good working order) produces electricity abundantly, and in working\r\nit I observed that ozone was so freely generated, that more than once\r\nthe air of my laboratory became charged with ozone to an oppressive\r\ndegree. The fact led me to use this machine for the production of\r\nozone on a large scale, in the following way.\r\n\r\nFrom the terminals of the machine two wires are carried and are\r\nconducted, by their terminals, to an ozone generator formed somewhat\r\nafter the manner of Siemens', but with this difference, that the\r\ndischarge is made through a series of fine points within the\r\ncylinders. The machine is placed on a table with the ozone generator\r\nat the back of it, and can be so arranged that with the turning of the\r\nhandle which works the machine a blast of air is carried through the\r\ngenerator. Thus by one action electricity is generated, sparks are\r\ndischarged in the ozone generator, air is driven through, and ozone is\r\ndelivered over freely.\r\n\r\nIf it be wished to use pure oxygen instead of common air, nothing more\r\nis required than to use compressed oxygen and to allow a gentle\r\ncurrent to pass through the ozone generator in place of air. For this\r\npurpose Brin's compressed oxygen is the purest and best; but for\r\nordinary service atmospheric air is sufficient.[2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: For illustration to-day, Messrs Mayfield, the\r\n    electrical engineers of Queen Victoria Street, E. C., have been\r\n    good enough to lend me a machine fitted up on the plan named. It\r\n    works so effectively that I can make the ozone given off from it\r\n    detectable in every part of this large hall.]\r\n\r\nThe advantages of this apparatus are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. With care it is always ready for use, and as no battery is required\r\nnor anything more than the turning of a handle, any person can work\r\nit.\r\n\r\n2. It can be readily moved about from one part of a room or ward to\r\nanother part.\r\n\r\n3. If required for the sick it can be wheeled near the bedside and, by\r\na tube, the ozone it emits can be brought into action in any way\r\ndesired by the physician.\r\n\r\nI refer in the above to the minor uses of ozone by this method, but I\r\nshould add that it admits of application on a much grander scale. It\r\nwould now be quite easy in any public institution to have a room in\r\nwhich a large compound Wimshurst could be worked with a gas engine,\r\nand from which, with the additional apparatus named, ozone could be\r\ndistributed at pleasure into any part of the building. On a still\r\nlarger scale ozone could be supplied to towns by this method, as\r\nsuggested in Hygeiopolis, the model city.\r\n\r\nIt will occur, I doubt not, to the learned president of this section,\r\nand to others of our common profession, that care will have to be\r\ntaken in the application of ozone that it be used with discretion.\r\nThis is true. It has been observed in regard to diseases, that in the\r\npresence of some diseases ozone is absent in the atmosphere, but that\r\nwith other diseases ozone is present in abundance. During epidemics of\r\ncholera, ozone is at a minimum. During other epidemics, like\r\ninfluenza, it has been at a maximum. In our paper Dr. Moffatt and I\r\nclassified diseases under both conditions, and the difference must\r\nnever be forgotten, since in some diseases we might by the use of\r\nozone do mischief instead of good. Moreover, as my published\r\nexperiments have shown, prolonged inhalation of ozone produces\r\nheadache, coryza, soreness of the eyes, soreness of the throat,\r\ngeneral malaise, and all the symptoms of severe influenza cold.\r\nWarm-blooded animals, also, exposed to it in full charge, suffer from\r\ncongestion of the lungs, which may prove rapidly fatal. With care,\r\nhowever, these dangers are easily avoided, the point of practice being\r\nnever to charge the air with ozone too abundantly or too long.\r\n\r\nA simple test affords good evidence as to presence of ozone. If into\r\ntwenty ounces of water there be put one ounce of starch and forty\r\ngrains of potassium iodide, and the whole be boiled together, a starch\r\nwill be made which can be used as a test for ozone. If ozone be passed\r\nthrough this starch the potassium is oxidized, and the iodine, set\r\nfree, strikes a blue color with the starch. Or bibulous paper can be\r\ndipped in the starch, dried and cut into slips, and these slips being\r\nplaced in the air will indicate when ozone is present. In disinfecting\r\nor purifying the air of a room with ozone, there is no occasion to\r\nstop until the test paper, by change of color, shows that the ozone\r\nhas done its work of destroying the organic matter which is the cause\r\nof impurity or danger. For my own part, I have never seen the\r\nslightest risk from the use of ozone in an impure air. The difficulty\r\nhas always been to obtain sufficient ozone to remove the impurity, and\r\nit is this difficulty which I hope now to have conquered.--_The\r\nAsclepiad._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAT IN MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a recent meeting of the Physiological Society of Berlin, Prof.\r\nZuntz spoke on heat regulation in man, basing his remarks on\r\nexperiments made by Dr. Loewy. The store of heat in the human body at\r\nany one time is very large, equal, in fact, to nearly all the heat\r\nproduced by the body during twenty hours, hence the heat given off to\r\na calorimeter during a given period cannot be taken as a measure of\r\nthe heat production. This determination must be based rather upon the\r\namount of oxygen consumed and of carbonic acid gas given off. The\r\npurpose of the experiments was to ascertain what alteration the\r\ngaseous interchange of the body undergoes by the application of cold,\r\ninasmuch as existing data on this point are largely contradictory.\r\n\r\nThe observations were made on a number of men whose respiratory gases\r\nwere compared, during complete rest, when they were at one time\r\nclothed, at another time naked, at temperatures from 12° to 15° C.,\r\nand in warm and cold baths. Each experiment lasted from half an hour\r\nto an hour, during which period the gases were repeatedly analyzed. As\r\na result of fifty-five experiments, twenty showed no alteration of\r\noxygen consumption as the result of cooling, nine gave a lessened\r\nconsumption, while the remaining twenty-six showed an increased using\r\nup of oxygen. This diversity of result is explicable on the basis of\r\nobservations made by Prof. Zuntz, who was himself experimented upon,\r\nas to his subjective heat sensations during the experiments. He found\r\nthat after the first impression due to the application of cold is\r\novercome, it was quite easy to maintain himself in a perfectly passive\r\ncondition; subsequently it required a distinct effort of the will to\r\nrefrain from shivering and throwing the muscles into activity, and\r\nfinally even this became no longer possible, and involuntary shivering\r\nand muscular contraction supervened, as soon as the body temperature\r\n(_in ano_) had fallen ½° to 1° C. During the first stage of cooling,\r\nZuntz's oxygen consumption showed a uniform diminution; during the\r\nperiod also in which shivering was repressed by an effort of the will,\r\ncooling led to no increased consumption of oxygen, but as soon as\r\nshivering became involuntary there was at once an increased using up\r\nof oxygen and excretion of carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nThis explains the differences in the results of Dr. Loewy's\r\nexperiments, and may be taken to show that in man, and presumably in\r\n_large_ animals, heat regulation as directly dependent upon alteration\r\n(fall) in temperature of the surrounding medium does not exist; the\r\nincreased heat production is rather the outcome of the movements\r\nresulting from the application of cold to the body. In _small_\r\nanimals, on the other hand, there undoubtedly exists a heat regulation\r\ndependent upon an increased activity of chemical changes in the\r\ntissues set up by the application of cold to the surface of the body,\r\nand in this case the thermotaxic centers in the brain most probably\r\nplay some part.--Dr. Herter gave an account of experiments made by Dr.\r\nPopoff on the artificial digestion of various and variously cooked\r\nmeats. Lean beef and the flesh of eels and flounders were digested in\r\nartificial gastric juice; the amount of raw flesh thus peptonized was\r\nin all cases greater than that of cooked meat similarly treated. The\r\nflesh was shredded and heated by steam to 100° C. The result was the\r\nsame for beef as for fish. When compared with each other, beef was, on\r\nthe whole, the most digestible, but the amount of fish flesh which was\r\npeptonized was sufficiently great to do away with the evil repute\r\nwhich fish still has in Germany as a proteid food. Smoked meat\r\ndiffered in no essential extent from raw meat as regards its\r\ndigestibility.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF SPIDERS FOR THE CABINET.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor several years past, I have devoted a portion of my leisure time to\r\nthe arrangement of the collection of Arachnidæ of the Natural History\r\nMuseum of the University of Gand. This collection, which is partially\r\na result of my own captures, is quite a large one, for a university\r\nmuseum, since it comprises more than six hundred European and foreign\r\nspecimens. Each group of individuals of the small forms and each\r\nindividual of the large forms is contained in a bottle of alcohol\r\nclosed with a ground glass stopper, and, whenever possible, the\r\nspecimens have been spread out and fixed upon strips of glass.\r\n\r\nThe loss of alcohol through evaporation is almost entirely prevented\r\nby paraffining the stoppers and tying a piece of bladder over them.\r\n\r\nProperly labeled, the series has a very satisfactory aspect, and is\r\neasily consulted for study. The reader, however, will readily\r\nunderstand how much time and patience such work requires, and can\r\neasily imagine how great an amount of space the collection occupies,\r\nit being at least twenty times greater than that that would be taken\r\nup by a collection of an equal number of insects mounted in the\r\nordinary way on pins and kept in boxes.\r\n\r\nThese inconveniences led me to endeavor to find out whether there was\r\nnot some way of preserving spiders, properly so called, in a dry\r\nstate, and without distortion or notable modification of their colors.\r\n\r\nExperience long ago taught me that pure and simple desiccation, after\r\na more or less prolonged immersion in alcohol, gives passable results\r\nonly with scorpions, galeodes, phrynes, and mygales, and consequently\r\nwith arachnides having thick integuments, while it is entirely\r\nunsuccessful with most of the spiders. The abdomen of these shrivels,\r\nthe characteristic colors disappear in great part, and the animals\r\nbecome unrecognizable.\r\n\r\nSomething else was therefore necessary, and I thought of carbolated\r\nglycerine. My process, which I have tried only upon the common species\r\nof the country--_Tegenaria domestica_, _Epeira cucurbitina_, _Zilla\r\ninclinata_, etc., having furnished me with preparations that were\r\ngenerally satisfactory. I think I shall be doing collectors a service\r\nby publishing it in the _Naturaliste_.\r\n\r\nThe specimens should first be deprived of moisture, that is to say,\r\nthey should be allowed to remain eight or ten days in succession in 50\r\nper cent. alcohol and in pure commercial alcohol. Absolute alcohol is\r\nnot necessary.\r\n\r\nAfter being taken from the alcohol, and allowed to drain, the\r\nspecimens are immersed in a mixture compound of\r\n\r\n  Pure glycerine 2 volumes,\r\n  Pure carbolic acid in crystals 1 volume.\r\n\r\nIn this they ought to remain at least a week, but there will be no\r\nharm if they are left therein indefinitely, so that the collections of\r\nsummer may be mounted during winter evenings.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a little more delicate, although very easy. After\r\nbeing removed from the carbolated glycerine, the spiders are placed\r\nupon several folds of white filtering paper, and are changed from time\r\nto time until the greatest part of the liquid has been absorbed. An\r\ninsect pin is then passed through the cephalothorax of each individual\r\nand is inserted in the support upon which the final desiccation is to\r\ntake place. This support consists of a piece of sheet cork tacked or\r\nglued at the edges to a piece of wood at least one inch in thickness.\r\nUpon the cork are placed four or five folds of filtering paper, so\r\nthat the ventral surface of the pinned spider is in contact with this\r\nabsorbing surface. For the rest, the legs, palpi, spinnerets, etc.,\r\nare spread out by means of fine pins, precisely as would be done in\r\nthe case of coleoptera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SETTING BOARD FOR SPIDERS.\r\n\r\nA. Absorbent papers. B. Sheet cork. C. Wooden support.]\r\n\r\nThe setting board is put for two or three months in a very dry place\r\nunder cover from dust.\r\n\r\nThe spiders thus treated will scarcely have changed in appearance, the\r\nabdomen of the largest Epeiras will have preserved its form, the hairs\r\nwill in nowise have become agglutinated, and a person would never\r\nsuspect that glycerine had performed the role.\r\n\r\nThe forms with a large abdomen require a special precaution; it is\r\nnecessary to pass the mounting pin through a piece of thin cardboard\r\nor of gelatine prolonged behind under the abdomen, because the latter\r\nis heavy, and the pedicel that connects it with the cephalothorax\r\neasily breaks.\r\n\r\nThe specimens are mounted in boxes lined with cork, just as insects\r\nare.\r\n\r\nAs there is nothing simpler than to have in one's laboratory three\r\nbottles, two of them containing alcohol and the other containing\r\ncarbolated glycerine, and as it is easy to make setting boards capable\r\nof holding from twenty to thirty individuals at once, it will be seen\r\nthat, with a little practice, the method is scarcely any more\r\ncomplicated than the one daily employed for coleoptera and orthoptera,\r\nwhich latter, too, must pass through alcohol, and be pinned, spread\r\nout, and dried. There are but two additional elements, carbolated\r\nglycerine and absorbent paper. I do not estimate the time necessary\r\nfor desiccation as being very long, since the zoologist can occupy\r\nhimself with other subjects while the specimens are drying. Let us add\r\nthat the process renders the preservation indefinite, and that\r\ndestructive insects are not to be feared. Some vertebrates, such as\r\nmonkeys, that I preserved in the flesh ten years ago, by a nearly\r\nidentical method, are still intact.--_F.

The great bulk\r\nof that year's product has entered into consumption, but there yet\r\nremains unsold to consumers, we are informed, about ten carloads,\r\nwhich, it is expected, will be sold during the next three months. It\r\nhas been observed by those handling this product that the largest\r\nsales of dried wine grapes in 1888 and 1889 took place at those points\r\nto which the first lots were shipped in 1887, which would show that as\r\nthe product becomes better known it finds a readier market.\r\n\r\nDried wine grapes are prepared in a similar manner to raisins; that is\r\nthey are dried in the sun, but do not require the same care in\r\nhandling that are given to raisins. Wooden trays 2 × 3 are sometimes\r\nused, but it is by no means necessary to go to the expense of\r\nprocuring trays, as it has been found that a good quality of coarse\r\nbrown paper will answer every purpose, and this, with care, may be\r\nmade to last two or three seasons. The drying was last season\r\nprincipally done on the bare ground, but there is much loss by\r\nshelling, as those dried are required to be turned; a pitchfork is\r\nused for that purpose. Brown building paper can be procured of city\r\npaper dealers in large rolls at four and a half cents per pound;\r\naccording to the thickness, it will cost from one and three-quarters\r\nto three and a half cents per square yard. A thin, tough, waterproof\r\npaper is also made in rolls at about six cents a square yard. Wine\r\ngrapes dry in from ten days to three weeks, according to variety and\r\nweather, and with the exception of Malvoisie, Rose of Peru, and Black\r\nHamburg, from three and a half to four and a half tons of the green\r\nfruit are required to make one of the dried; these three varieties,\r\nhowever, being large, meaty, and a firm pulp, do not require more than\r\nfrom three to three and a half tons of the green fruit to produce one\r\nton of dried, and are, therefore, the most profitable for drying; they\r\nalso command better values in the market. The grapes are sufficiently\r\ndried when, on being rolled between the thumb and finger, no moisture\r\nexudes, and also when the stems are found to be dry and brittle, so\r\nthat they can be separated readily from the berries. After the grapes\r\nhave reached the proper state of dryness, they are taken in boxes or\r\nsacks to the packing house, where they are stemmed and cleaned, after\r\nwhich they are packed in white cotton sacks, holding from fifty to\r\nseventy-five pounds each, and when marked are ready for shipment.\r\n\r\nThe stemming and cleaning of the dried grapes is done by special\r\nmachines designed for that purpose, which leaves the fruit in a\r\nbright, clean condition attractive to purchasers. These machines are\r\nat present built only by James Porteous, Fresno, and are operated\r\neither by hand or power. The cost of a stemmer and cleaner complete is\r\n$80, f. o. b. cars at Fresno. Where several producers can do so, it\r\nwould be advisable to club together and get the machine in this way.\r\nMuch extra expense could be avoided and one set of machinery would\r\nserve several vineyards, possibly an entire district where time was\r\nnot a great object; or some one person in a district could purchase an\r\noutfit and do the work by contract, going from place to place. The\r\ncapacity of the stemmer and cleaner is from five to eight tons per\r\nday, when the grapes are in proper condition; and the cost or charge\r\nfor stemming, cleaning, sacking, and sewing up the sacks is from four\r\nto five dollars per ton when the producer furnishes the sacks. Good\r\ncotton sacks, holding about seventy-five pounds, cost from eight to\r\nten cents each, including the necessary twine. Last year dried grapes\r\nwere generally sold for cash, f. o. b., but it is probable that other\r\nmarkets could be secured by selling on consignment.\r\n\r\nAs to the advisability of such a course, each producer must himself be\r\nthe judge. It is, however, quite certain that until consumers have an\r\nopportunity to try this product, the sales will necessarily be more or\r\nless limited, unless vigorously pushed by merchants and others\r\ninterested in extending the markets for California products in the\r\nEastern cities not yet tried. The varieties most suitable and\r\nprofitable for drying, and especially for consumption in the Eastern\r\nmarkets, are the Malvoisie, Rose of Peru, Black Hamburg, Mission,\r\nZinfandel, Charbono, Grenache, and in some localities the Carignan, of\r\nthe dark varieties, and the Feher Zagos and Golden Chasselas of the\r\nwhite grapes; there are many other white grapes that are excellent\r\nwhen dried, but are too valuable for wine-making purposes, or are too\r\nsmall or deficient in sugar for use as dried grapes.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of the dark grapes, some of which ripen so late that\r\nit would be impossible to dry them in the sun, and the use of\r\nartificial heat is, at present prices, too expensive. Therefore, the\r\nvarieties mentioned, which generally mature early, are found to be the\r\nmost suitable for this purpose. This product is sold by dealers in the\r\nEastern cities for cooking purposes, and as a substitute for dried\r\nfruits, such as peaches, apples, apricots, etc., in comparison with\r\nwhich it is usually much cheaper; while for stewing and for puddings\r\nand pies it answers the same purpose. The demand for this product will\r\nprobably be gauged by the Eastern fruit crop; that is, the quantity\r\nthat can be disposed of will depend upon the quantity of Eastern fruit\r\nin the market, and the prices will be largely dependent upon that of\r\ndried fruit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALNUT OIL.\r\n\r\nBy THOMAS T. P. BRUCE WARREN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis oil, which I obtained from the fully ripened nut of the _Jugluns\r\nregia_, has so many excellent properties, especially for mixing with\r\nartists' colors for fine art work, that I am surprised at the small\r\namount of information available on this interesting oil.\r\n\r\nWalnut oil is largely used for adulterating olive oil, and to\r\ncompensate for its high iodine absorption it is mixed with pure lard\r\noil olein, which also retards the thickening effect due to oxidation.\r\nThe marc left on expression of the oil is said to be largely used in\r\nthe manufacture of chocolate. Many people, I am told, prefer walnut\r\noil to olive oil for cooking purposes.\r\n\r\nThe value of this oil for out-door work has been given me by a friend\r\nwho used it for painting the verandas and jalousies of his house (near\r\nComo, Italy) some twenty years ago, and which have not required\r\npainting since. In this country, at least, walnut oil is beyond the\r\nreach of the general painter, and I do not know that the pure oil is\r\nto be obtained as a commercial article, even on a small scale.\r\n\r\nIt was in examining the properties of this and other oils, used as\r\nadulterants of olive oil, that I was obliged to prepare them so as to\r\nbe sure of getting them in a reliable condition as regards purity. The\r\nwalnuts were harvested in the autumn of 1887, and kept in a dry airy\r\nroom until the following March. The kernels had shrunk up and\r\ncontracted a disagreeable acrid taste, so familiar with old olive oil\r\nin which this has been used as an adulterant. Most oxidized oils,\r\nespecially cotton seed oil, reveal a similar acrid taste, but walnut\r\noil has, in addition, an unmistakable increase in viscosity. The nuts\r\nwere opened and the kernels thrown into warm water, so as to loosen\r\nthe epidermis; they were then rubbed in a coarse towel, so as to\r\nblanch them. The decorticated nuts were wiped dry and rubbed to a\r\nsmooth paste in a marble mortar. The paste was first digested in CS2,\r\nthen placed in a percolator and exhausted with the same solvent, which\r\nwas evaporated off. The yield of oil was small, but probably, if the\r\nnuts had been left to fully ripen on the trees without knocking them\r\noff, the yield might have been greater. It is by no means improbable\r\nthat oxidation may have rendered a portion of the oil insoluble. The\r\ndecorticated kernels gave a perfectly sweet, inodorous, and almost\r\ncolorless oil, which rapidly thickens to an almost colorless,\r\ntransparent, and perfectly elastic skin or film, which does not darken\r\nor crack easily by age. These are properties which, for fine art\r\npainting, might be of great value in preserving the tinctorial purity\r\nand freshness of pigments.\r\n\r\nSulphur chloride gives a perfectly white product with the fresh oil,\r\nbut, when oxidized, the product is very dark, almost black. The iodine\r\nabsorption of the fresh oil thus obtained is very high, but falls\r\nrapidly by oxidation or blowing. A curious fact has been disclosed\r\nwith reference to the oxidation of this and similar oils. If such an\r\noil be mixed with lard oil, olive oil, or sperm oil, it thickens by\r\noxidation, but is perfectly soluble. Such a mixture is largely used in\r\nweaving or spinning. Commercial samples of linseed oil, when\r\ncold-drawn, have a much higher iodine absorption, probably due to the\r\nsame cause. Oils extracted by CS2 are very much higher than the same\r\noils, especially if hot-pressed.--_Chem.

EDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nLately I called attention to the metabisulphite of potassium as an\r\naddition to the pyro solution for development, and can give now some\r\nof my experiences with this salt.\r\n\r\nThe metabisulphite of potassium, which was introduced into the market\r\nby Dr. Schuchardt, and whose correct analysis is not known yet, is a\r\nwhite crystal, which in a solid condition, as well as in an aqueous\r\nsolution, has a strong smell of sulphurous acid. An aqueous 2 per\r\ncent. solution of this salt dissolves pyrogallic acid to a weak\r\nyellowish color, being distinguished from the more light brown\r\nsolution of sulphite of soda and pyro. The solution kept very well for\r\nfour weeks in half-filled bottles, and showed a better preservation\r\nthan the usual solution of pyro and sulphite of soda. More than 2 per\r\ncent. of the metabisulphite of potassium is without any advantage. If\r\nthis solution is mixed with soda, a picture will develop rapidly, but\r\nthe same will show a strongly yellow coloration in the gelatine film.\r\nSulphite of soda has to be added to the soda solution to obtain an\r\nagreeable brownish or black tone in the negatives.\r\n\r\nIf the contents of metabisulphite and pyro-soda developer are\r\nincreased, it will act very slowly; larger quantities of the\r\nmetabisulphite of potassium, therefore, act like a strong retarder. In\r\nsmall quantities there is no injurious retarding action, but it will\r\nhave the effect that the plates obtain very clear shadows in this\r\ndeveloper, and that the picture appears slower, and will strengthen\r\nmore slowly. The strongly retarding action of larger quantities of\r\nmetabisulphite might be accounted for in that the bisulphite will\r\ngive, with the carbonate of soda, monosulphite and soda bicarbonate,\r\nwhich latter is not a strong enough alkali to develop the bromide of\r\nsilver strongly with pyro. An increase of soda compensates this\r\nretarding action of the metabisulphite of potassium.\r\n\r\nGood results were obtained by me with this salt after several tests,\r\nby producing the following solutions:\r\n\r\n  A.\r\n\r\n  Pyrogallic acid                    4 grammes.\r\n  Metabisulphite of potassium        1½   \"\r\n  Water                            100 c. c.\r\n\r\nThis solution keeps for weeks in corked bottles.\r\n\r\n  B.\r\n\r\n  Crystallized soda                 10 grammes.\r\n  Neutral sulphite of soda          15    \"\r\n  Water                            100 c. c.\r\n\r\nBefore using mix--\r\n\r\n  Pyro solution A                   20 c. c.\r\n  Soda solution B                   20  \"\r\n  Water                             20  \"\r\n\r\nThe developer acts about one and a half times slower than the ordinary\r\npyro soda developer, approaching to the latter pretty nearly, and\r\ngives to the negatives an agreeable color and softness, with clear\r\nshadows. If the negatives are to be thinner, more water, say 30 to 40\r\nc. c., is taken. If denser, then the soda is increased, and the water\r\nin the developer is reduced. An alum bath before fixing is to be\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\nAn advantage of this development is the great durability of the\r\npyro-meta sulphite solution. The cost price is about the same as\r\nthat of the ordinary pyro developer.
